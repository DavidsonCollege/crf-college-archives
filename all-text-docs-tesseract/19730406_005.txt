LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Amnesty Revisited

To the Editor:

I was ‘interested by tie
editorial headed “AMNESTY”
in the March 9th issue:

Especially what I shall here
quote. paraphrased for brevity:
“The government insists that
the fugitive question is still per-
tinent to the military. a position
which reflects only a personal
bias of the President.”

Dealing first with the second
part of the above quoted
statement. the President has
taken a stand. but he has

seemed to voice a huge ground-

swell of public sentiment. He
is speaking for the “silent
majority’. For instance. he
speaks for me, and everybody
of mature judgement with
whom I have talked.

As for the significance of am-
nesty to the future of the
military. let me stress points
seldom seen (or acknowledged)
by the left-wing. liberal media

Unlike any previous war.
there was allowed to exist
during the Vietnam war a huge
un-American. pro-Communist
body of individuals often com-
pacted into “anti-War™ or other
protest groups. These groups in-
cluded Toy Hayden, Jerry

on draft dodging. would make
the most perfect group con-
ceivable, if brought back into
this country. from wiich to
b> tan a new crop of Havdens.

Wises. Spocks. Coffins, and
others of the same stripe.

They are already mad at
America. they would not make
good citizens, and they im-
pudently exhibit their “basic
training” in draft dodging by
demanding that America
apologize to them as a kind of
reparation.

There will be other wars. The
world is not safe. ever, cer-
tainly not until the Communists
declare they no longer intend to
conquer the world. and prove it
by tearing down the Berlin
Wall, and lifting the iron and
barhboo curtains. thus freeing
their people trom slavery.

I say let these future trouble
makers. who have shown they
cun be swayed into anti-
American actions. stay where
they are. We have enough
unemployment as it is. without
these unstable youths returning
to compete with returned
veterans inthe job market.

Professor Sees Students
Infected With Arrogance

By THOMAS A. ROGERSON
Professor of Spanish

“Write us a column, professor ,"’ the editor cajoled. Hidden within
the guileless request, as venom in a Borgia ring, was the unvoiced
addendum ‘‘and you’ll see that it isn’t so easy...and you'll see that
participles dangle most readily...and if you don’t see, we'll show

you mighty quickly.”

The professor, a Davidson professor, and as such, well trained in
obliging a student by doing his work for him, acceded. After all,
considering the Davidson work ethic, what could be more logical
than a professor writing for the student newspaper?

‘‘What topic?”
“The student body!”

‘Why not?"’, thought the professor, not only picking up the gaun-
tlet but putting it on and taking pen in hand. Had he not been at
least halfway up the long, tortuous road to Parnassus? Surely the
quenching waters of Castalia still would reach him even with such
an inflammable topic.

‘‘No matter what I say, somebody will take offense!” groaned the
professor, now bent over a blank page. ‘‘What could I have done to
those people to deserve such a topic, oh woe!” Then he remem-
bered that critique he had written recently in which, in words of
candor and of eternal truth, he had referred to student newspaper
writers as “‘illiterate’’ and ‘‘arrogant in their illiteracy.’’ This,
then, was to be his his comeuppance. The arrogant
professor, who arrogantly accused the humble scribes of being
arrogant, must be shamed, preferably arrogantly. How dare he
call them arrogant? Illiterate, yes! never! After all
doesn't ‘‘arrogance,” in addition to its etymological meaning, also
indicate a certain state of “‘being apart,’’ of ‘‘not being the same as
everyone else?’ That was what was intolerable!

Perish the thought that all Davidson students, scribes included,
not be alike, not be like everybody else, not be part of the ‘‘Real
Thing,” the Pepsi Generation, blue jeans, ecology, loving blacks
and the Lord! Yes, it was not the word “‘illiterate’’ that bothered
these men; it was definitely the word ‘‘arrogant.”’

As the professor rationalized the raison d'etre for his situation,
thoughts of his assigned topic came to mind more freely. When he
thought deeply about the excellence, or lack of it, in the student
body he recalled one of Jean-Paul Sartre’s remarks before the
French Academy. This austere body had been embroiled in a
typical, silly, never ending debate on the topic ‘‘Who is the greatest
poet of France?’’ One of the more conservative members had just
