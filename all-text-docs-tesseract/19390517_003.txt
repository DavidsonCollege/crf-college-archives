THE DAVIDSONIAN

Page Three

Question

of the Week

Two years ago a poll was taken
by Dick Vowles, editor of the Da-
vidsonian, concerning criticisms and

suggestions that could be made for
the Davidsonian. This poll of the
student body proved extremely
helpful, although it was not con-
tinued this year.

The editor and the
Davidsonian
constructive

the

to
and
suggestions. Since no poll has been

staff of

are always open

hear criticisms
taken this year the question this
week “What suggestions or
criticisms would you make for the
Davidsonian at the present time?”

George Jones, Senior:

1 think that the
could be improved greatly by hav-

is:

Davidsonian

ing more pictures. During the past
.. year, we have had more than the
number of but I

the students wel-
come an even greater number. More

usual pictures,

believe would
pictures of campus events and cam-
pus life would add a lot of life and
color to the paper.

Norris Erb, Sophomore:

For a college newspaper I think
the David is excellent; but
I think that the students would be
interested in knowing what other

schools are doing by way of new
ideas to improve the school and
better satisfy the students. As re-
cent “revolutions” show, Davidson
students aren’t satisfied.

Addison Long, Senior:

The Davidsonian a college
newspaper purpose of
publishing campus news excellent-
it that the
paper could be a much more ardent
of which
make for a better Davidson as.a-
gainst
new projects. Make use of its more

as
serves its

ly. However, seems

booster projects would

being a mere recorder of
or less dormant influence and let’s
make a good Davidson a better one.
Frank Atwater, Freshman:

As a matter of fact, | think the
Davidsonian

college newspaper being published,

is about as fine a

but of course there is always room
for improvement and also room
for new materjal. I know many of
us have noticed the lack of pic-
tures, and as Confucius (or some-
body) once said, “A picture is
worth a thousand \words in itself.”
Why not think about this, for aft-
er all, this is the age for speed,
even in college. By the way, if
some of our local talent were used,
maybe a few cartoons could be run
each week. I. know this doesn’t
leave much room for the Scripts
'’n Pranks, but from a candid view-
point, who cares? I doubt if these
suggestions go very far, (Aber-
nathy’s note—They certainly don’t),
but I believe if we did see more
human interest pictures and car-
toons appearing in the Davidson-
ians, we would hear more sayings
such as “Alenda me a nickel to
buy a Davidsonian.”

J. Daniel Gilliam, Junior:

The main criticism of the David-
sonian that I have is that we should
take care about having the names
of people and organizations correct
in our newspaper. Also, the word-
ing of headlines couid be better pre-
pared at times. Some of them ap-
pear a little crude, following a cheap
yellow press tendency rather than

of a dignified paper. It is the small,

things that make the difference
between a good and an excellent
paper, that will give us an All-
American standing. I believe we
can gain the honor again.

Ned Iverson, Senior:

The sports page is hardly but a
sports bulletin; it should consist
of two pages. There should be more
