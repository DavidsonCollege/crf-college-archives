Basketball team cited in NCAA practice

search is underway for new coach

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN
Basketball continues to make
news at Davidson long after the
final game of the season. Last
week Bobby Hussey announced
his resignation as the team’s head
coach. On Saturday, The Charlotte
Observer reported that the. team
committed an NCAA violation
last fall when it participated in
practices three days prior to the
‘ period allowed by the NCAA.
The Wildcats reportedly met in
Johnston Gym early in the morn-
ing October 12 with Hussey. Ac-
ording to junior Jeff Harris, “We
>ren’t going through a practice
‘se, but NCAA rules state that
can’t be with a ball going
rough plays.” Players say Assis-
«,-. nt Athletic Director Bob Price
was at the gym at the time and

reported:-the-violations—"=""-"""

The College sanctioned Hussey
tocancel three practices during the
regular season. Davidson attommey
Adrian Wilson told The Observer
that the NCAA had been notified
and that he had received a letter in

return from the NCAA saying that
the college had taken the proper
steps and no NCAA sanctions
would be necessary.

Most players say they were
unaware of the offense. ““Person-
ally, I didn’t know what consti-
tuted a legal practice,’ Alan
Hunter said. According to players,
President Kuykendall sent a letter
to the team explaining why the
practices had been cancelled.
Team members confirmed The
Observer's report that Hussey
made no formal apology to the
team nor gave an explanation for
the practices which had been
called off.

Hussey cited philosophical dif-
ferences between Athletic Direc-
tor Kit Morris and himself as his
primary motive to resign. He did

not mention the NCAA Vidlation © “Spirit.” a...
Although the NCAA plasaitied Re

in reference to his decision. Morris
would not comment on whether
the violations were a factor in-
volved. :

Morris was not present at

Hussey’s press conference last

Friday. Tom Sorenson’s article in
The Observer attributes his ab-
sence to a golf game; “On Friday,
one of the more important days in
Davidson sports history, Athletic
Director Kit Morris leaves his of-
fice to play golf.”

Morris, however, called Soren-
son’s attack “a cheap shot.”

“T spent last Friday morning in
the airport in Charlotte speaking
with a prospective basketball
coach,” he explained. “I did spend
10 minutes at the putting green in
Covington instead of eating lunch;

that was the extent of my golf

game,” he said.

In reference to the NCAA viola-
tion, Morris stressed that there
have been “no changes in policy.
We still believe in upholding

NCAA regulations i in. letter and.

ne ig =

infractions in various degrees of
severity, Morris stated, “We tend
to view any violation of rules as a
serious violation.” He said that
there have been very few viola-

tions at Davidson.

When asked about Davidson’s
present standing with the NCAA,
Morris said, “I would like to reiter-
ate President Kuykendall’s com-
ment in The Observer that we are
squared away with the NCAA to

complete interview.

‘usually
year, however, he may be suiting up for Vanderbilt. See page 10 for a

violation;

our knowledge.”

Morris says that the search for
Davidson’s next coach is well
under way.
