Gorabachev Loses Credibility in Lithuania

we made it up) but it accurately de-

his moderate and reform-minded
associates, and reign in that pesky
democracy movement before the
USSR (loosely translated “Society
that makes Iraq look good”’) disin-
tegrates.

Winston Churchill told FDR
that he refused to be forever known
as the prime minister that presided
over the dismemberment of the
British empire. Gorbachev is
probably from the same school of
thought, though certainly from a
different age.

Stalin managed, through ter-
rible purges and buckets of blood,
to achieve the seemingly impos-
sible. He forcibly joined ethni-
cally heterogeneous nations under

* one giant red umbrella of fear and

intimidation. The methods were
deplorable, but Gorbachev proba-
bly thinks that the end result is
worth keeping, no matter its ori-

preferable to a country
whose population ex-
ceeds a billion tearing itself apart
over some abstract principle that
most of the peasants were too ig-
norant to understand.

After all, many Russians now
say they would prefer a stronger
central authority than the chaos
they are currently experiencing.
The problem with such specious
reasoning is that it generally tends
to justify the subordination of
people to a power structure for the
sake of the powerful human need
for security (Mao called it “or-
der’). This is precisely the tyranny
that brought Russia to its current
economic condition.

Perhaps, then, revolution is
indeed the answer.’ Revolutions
are rarely simple. Americans are
rather a spoiled lot, considering
the relatively bloodless way in
which England cut us off from the
great “sphere of influence.” Eve-
rybody out there, think. What was

good about the French Revolu-
tion?

Democracy, freedom, and rid
of that bitch Antoinette. And yet,
atthe same time, the reign of terror
killed many thousands of “citizens”
who succumbed to the guillotine
for the sake of “democracy.”
Peaceful change is the most desir-
able but also the least likely given
Gorbachev’s commitment to Stal-
inism.

The dilemma, surely, is

ways... you can’t win the Nobel
Peace Prize and then start killing
people in . . . Lithuanian and Lat-
via.” Itwould appear thata bloody
revolution is therefore imminent.

However, there is an alterna-
tive. Boris Yeltsin has always been
the odd man out in American for-
eign policy. Pretty common com-
pared to the likes of George Bush
and Edvard Shevardnadze. Yet his

popular appeal (something Gor-
bachev lacks) is coupled with a

the wrong horse.

whether Gorbachev can hold his
Robespierres in check until the
economy providesa financial base
in which political reform can take
place. At least, that’s what the
political pundits seem to think (boy,
they were right about Iraq, weren’t
they?) It’s also possible that Gor-
bachev has progressed as far as he
is genetically able. He is, was, and
always will be a party man.

His consolidation of power in
the presidency, although portrayed
as a positive necessity for democ-
ratization, could also be used for
tyranny. You think? The bible

says something about not judging

a man by his words, but by his
deeds.

Yes, Gorbachev initiated re-
form. But he also stormed Vilnius
to suppress the very democratiza-
tin for which he received a nobel
prize. Senator Robert Dole (R.
Kansas) put it succinctly: “We
understand Mr. Gorbachev’s di-
lemma, but you can’t have it both

vision of an autonomous (i. e. de-
Unionized) Soviet Union that
would allow the various republics
to join economically as trading
partners, and think about political
re-union later.

We should at least send him a
couple of state department guys to
help him with the paperwork of
dissolving the Soviet Union.
Something is happening to the
Soviet Union; its dissolution so far
should have taught us the lesson
that we have an interest in “the new
world order” in Eastern Europe.
Americans are historically reluc-
tant tochange horses inmidstream,
but its possible that by continuing
to support Gorbachev, we’ re back-
ing the wrong horse.

Remember, revolutions by
definition area violent repudiation
of the old political order, with the
emphasis on violence. Change will
come, whether we like itornot. By
refusing to help Yeltsin now, we
may not get a ride at all.

The Dynamic Vision Of Representative Barbara Jordan:
Partnership Of Citizen, Community and Nation

About six years ago I sat
slouched in a chair at my private
high school’s auditorium in Hous-
ton, Texas. It wasa Wednesday af-
ternoon and I didn’t want to be

there. The other three hundred
students were of backgrounds
similar to my own: the children of
doctors, lawyers and businessper-

sons. My feelings were not in the
minority either. I wanted to leave
the auditorium so that I could go
and ‘hang out’ for the remainder of
the afternoon. After having waited
only several minutes, I was con-
vinced that we were being philan-
‘thropic simply to listen to whover

and the national levels. Ms. Jordan
had been a Democrat Representa-
tive from Texas who, on the floor
of the House of Representatives in
1973, was critical in swaying
Congressional opinion regarding
the Watergate Affair. She teaches
at the L.B.J. School of Public Pol-

The United States has lacked one fundamental

whole is that we lack the feel of a community.

the speaker was. Although I was
not aware of it at the time, the
speaker was to have a profound
impact upon my future. Soon our
anxieties were alleviated as the
surprise speaker arrived.

The face, though unfamiliar
to me, was that of Barbara Jordan,
the famous politician from Austin
who had been quite active with
Ross Perot in promoting higher
education standards atboth the state

icy at the University of Texas.
Jordan had not accepted speaking
invitations for quite along time but
there was a reason why she had
come to our school. The children
who slouch in their chairs as they
watch speakers eventually grow
into leaders from all sectors of our
community. The reason that Bar-
bara Jordan came to the Kinkaid
School was because its doors had
been closed to her years ago as an

african american child from a dis-
advantaged part of Houston. It
was an honor for all to have her in
our school.

She uses a wheelchair and our
headmaster, usually a jovial man,
was quite somber as he pushed her
chair towards the podium. She
came with a powerful message for
both myself asa listener and to my
peer groupasa whole. AWORLD,
A NATION, A COMMUNITY-
none of the above self-perpetuate.
Itisthe responsibility of the society,
Particularly those who benefit most
from its structures, tocontinuously
work and strive towards a ‘higher
goal’ so that the society not only
Survives and continues to func-
tion, butalso continues to improve
the lives of all of its members. The
woman before us had dedicated
her life to the service of the society
and of the nation so that the envi-
ronment would change, so that poor
african american children were not
barred from any institution or

Opportunity, so that we, as a na-

tion, continued to experience the

reality of dynamic, positive change.
Itis with that spirit that she contin-
ues to teach and to encourage oth-
ers, especially our nation’s young,
to do the same.

Based upon Jordan’s lead, we
can explore how her message re-
lates to our own political situation.
Our environment was founded
upon fundamental laws. The vig-
ilance of those laws cannot dete-
riorate if our nation andits govern-
mental entity are to survive as the
credible representation of our
democratic union. If the desire to
work towards an improved Society
for all does not also extend into
both the middle and upper classes
of America, our ‘experiment’ ofa
nation is bound to rot at the core

the time and continue to be hotly
