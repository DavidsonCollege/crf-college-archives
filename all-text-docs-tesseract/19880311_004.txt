Action Jackson:
a mere shadow of an

action film

Little violence, lots o’ hooters

By BRUCE PLOURDE~>
Just who is Action Jackson? He
is the most feared enforcer of the
law in all of Detroit. Robocop just
doesn’t compare. He’s so danger-
ous they don’t allow him:to carry
a gun. Nobody really knows

where he came from. Some say he ~

was built by NASA to be the first
man to walk on the moon without
a space suit. Others say that his
mother was raped by Bigfoot, and
that Jackson is the result. A Jean,
‘mean / incarcerating machine,

nobody tangles with Action
Jackson without some alterations
in their person.

Atleast that’s the big buildup of
not only the previews and adver-
tisements, but the first twenty
minutes of the movie as well. As it
turns out, the audience soon finds
that Sergeant Jericho Jackson
(Carl Weathers) is the mere

’ shadow of his former self. His

action days disappeared with the
loss of his rank as lieutenant. All
that remains of the desk-bound

Cinema.Classics’

hulk is the reputation of days gone

by.

As such, the movie-drags. For
what does one go to see in an
action picture? What’ does one
expect from Carl Weathers, the
athletically built star of Predator
and the Rocky movies? Certainly
not the Martin Luther King figure
that he plays here. Jackson exerts
himself to the utmost to avoid
trouble until the very end of the

film, when the.audience receives

what it expects, a rather intense
catharsis through violence, after
which every problem works out to

- the advantage of the hero. Hooray.

Craig T. Nelson as the villain-

‘ Ous Peter Dellaplane has the better

of the two roles. He takes great

delight in his life of total corrup-
‘tion and abuse of power. The re-

spected builder of the Halley auto-
mobile, he lusts for the ultimate
power made available in acapital-

eT samerrre tome Bry,

Hepburn, Grant shine i in
Bringing Up Baby

By FRANK LORD

Charles Colton once said,
“Imitation is the sincerest flat-
tery.” If that is true, then almost
everyone who ever made a com-
edy must have wanted to flatter
Howard Hawks in general and this
film in particular. Its imitatorsrun
the full gamut of the spectrum
from The Flintstones (thanks for
the observation, Drew Hender-
son) to Who’ sThatGirl? - yes, that
was Madonna’s last film. Having
seen many of the imitations as
well as the original, I can safely
say that I prefer Hawk’s version to
any of the others.

The plot of the film involves a
flaky paleontologist - played by
Cary Grant - who istrying to finish
putting together the skeleton of a
Brontosaurus that he has been
working on for four years, obtain
a million dollar donation for his
museum, and get married. Things

are fine until. he runs across-an

equally flaky heiress - played by
Katharine Hepburn - and her leop-
ard named Baby.

~The set up is ripe with opportu-
nities for amusing situations and
Hawks does not miss a single one.
All of the trials, tribulations and
complications that the protago-
nists go through as this film winds
its way to the denouement can not
help but make you chuckle.

The operative problem with any
film that has been copied as fre-
quently as this one has is that
everyone already knows the

punch lines for all the jokes.
There is no way that itcan help but
be predictable. However, Hawks,
with his masterful handling of the
Situations in ‘the’ film, reaches a
level of craftsmanship that none
of his imitators even approach.

Predictability isa factor, but nota
very important one.

Another, perhaps more serious,
problem comes not from the film
itself, but from the jaded eyes of a
1980s audience watching a 1938
film. During the 1960s, it became
possible to make films on almost
any given subject. Censorship,
which had played an important
role in film history up to this point,
began to be less important than it
had in the preceding years. Con-
sequently, many individuals in-
volved in the film industry
thought that it might be nice to
have almost all comedies involve
sex and violence. The resulting
films made their predecessors
look very, very tame.

Therefore, if it is sex and vio-
lence that your corrupt little heart

“craves you must look elsewhere, ~

but if what you want is to spend an
entirely enjoyable hour and a half
with Cary Grant and Katherine
Hepburn, then this is the film for
you.

The performances by Grant and
Hepburn are marvelous. If you
like these actors, but have never
