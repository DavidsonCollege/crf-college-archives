Potency of Press Up to Students

A nervous change in midstream has
been consumated. and tonight you see
the first product of the incoming David-
sonian staff. At the outset. it is necessary
as well as customary to outline our gen-
eral policy and program.

In the page of platforms presented a
month ago, numerous possibilities for
change and improvement were suggested.
Some of these you will find incorporated
in this edition, while others by their
very nature require: long-range planning
and preparation before being introduced.

In the three remaining weeks of pub-
lication this semeter, the main goal will
be the continuation of a creditable paper,
as each member of the staff familiarizes
himself with the mechanics, problems.
and techniques of his respective position.
With these fundamental _ intricacies
thoroughly understood and mastered.
next fall complete energy and attention
can be focused on constant and creative

Raiford---Martyr or

A prolonged, electric hour of silence
held sway over WBT radio from 11 to
12 p.m. Wednesday, April 11. Belated at-
tempts to bring in the daily fare of rip-
pling rhythm were greeted by a puzzling
hum of nothingness. Bob Raiford. ex-
tremely popular disc jockey, had been
forced off the air after a half-hour of
opinionated dissertation concerning the
Nat “King” Cole incident in Birmingham
and its implications.

Doors slammed, feet scurried, and
the news spread as only it can at D. C.
Before more than. thirty minutes of the
unusual quiet had passed, most of David-
son was alerted to the fact that the
- master provider of the smooth listening
music was in a precarious position. In-
spection of the following day's tabloids
confirmed their fears. Raiford was at
random permanently.

Although a good percentage of the stu-
dent body was disturbed to see the best
disc jockey in this area anathematized,
the mere saga of a local radio personality
and his hi-jinks are not consuming the
editorial space this week.

The reasons behind his firing, what
their implications are, and our. attitude
toward the whole unpleasant affair are,
it seems to me, of such importance to
demand our attention.

On the evening before Raiford’s de-
parture, Nat “King” Cole, colored re-
cording star, had been attacked by three
white men while performing before a
white audience in Birmingham, Alabama.
A Northern press, ever quick to exploit
any choice item that depicts a radical
south, blew the story up into a front page
spectacular that covered the nation’s
papers.

Incensed by the outrageous attack on
Cole and by the subsequent derogatory
publicity for the South, he decided to
act in such a manner to demonstrate
clearly that this was the exception, not
the norm, of Southern attitude. With a
program that covers the Eastern United
States, accompanied by an immense
audience, his radio medium served his
purpose adequately.

That he was sincere and courageous
in presenting his position in the face of
opposition, few can deny. That there was
a real need for a voice of the people
to counteract misrepresentations, most

improveinent.

Much has been idly said about mak-
ing the Davidsonian actively represent-
ative of the opinion of this student body.
However, without your direct individual
and collective support. this is impossible.
Your constructive criticisms and sug-
gestions are absolutely vital to this end.
No limited staff can hope to approach it
alone.

To be specific, through letters-to-the-
editor and personal contacts with staff
members, this can be effectively carried
through. On issues now before us and
on those which will inevitably arise in
the coming year. responsible and level-
headed student opinion can and must be
an important and in some cases, de-
cisive factor. Much of the responsibility
that this opinion will be heard and given
weight rests with vou, the individual stu-
dent. The Davidsonian is your voice. Use
it.

Malcontent? |

will agree. That he “may have over-
stepped himself seems fairly certain.

To those of us who were tuned in on
this broadcast, it became apparent that
WBT would have little alternative to
firing him. Because he had been forbid-
den to present his views in this fashion,
he. almost deliberately, stopped little
short. of asking for dismissal. As far as
it goes, he was insubordinate, disobeyed.
orders, and the station was within its
tights to release him.

The problem involved, however, goes
much deeper than a man losing a job.
Certainly if the problem of segregation
is going to reach any satisfactory cul-
mination, both sections of our land are
going to have to grow in understanding
and tolerance.

Even beyond the paramount problem
of a racial nature is the whole policy of
WBT and a majority of its fellow radio
and TV stations. The position of non-edi-
torializing, except as it is wired in in such
a fashion to allow the network: to catch
any repercussions, smacks of the “shrink-
ing violet.”

As the Federal Communications Sys-
tem nas stated, radios enjoy the same
editorializing privileges as do newspap-
ers, Raiford violated only the local rules
in his protest.

Why, then should such comments be
suppressed? Why should controversial
issues not be discussed, so that both sides
_of the question may be presented before
final judgement is made?

I do not like to feel that the station,
due to pressures from their audience,
from advertisers, or from directors, is
afraid to allow freedom of expression. It
has been a suspicion we had, which has
been emphasised by the Raiford situa-
tion, that radio contact with the public
has a long period of progression before it
accomplishes all of which it is capable in
formulation of public opinion.

If Raiford’s attitude was primarily
that of a disgruntled employee, it is not
worthy our attention. If he is truly a
sacrifice to a greater cause, then we owe
him a debt. We owe him, at least, a re-
evaluation of the place of radio in the
formation of public opinion. And we
should foster some concern with the dan-

gers inherent in a system that prevents -

a man from asserting his opinion.

Grace: A Symbol Indefinable

After the first .television re-
leases have been flown in and
broadcast, interspersed with. com-
mercials; after the first proceeds
from the most prodigious box-
office boom in motion picture his-
tory have begun to flow in; after
the festivals and the bell-ringing
and after the press has modestly
retired haggard and weary from.
the little realm, leaving Grace and
her prince to the blue waters of.
the eternal Mediterranean, the poct
has had his say, and the word
passes to the social philosopher.

What can justify the attention of
a nervous world? The fact of Grace
Kelly is obvious. Is it meaningful
as well?

For Mr. Kelly, nis daughter's
wedding in Monte Carlo this week
will have been a triumph, a moun-
tain-peak. He and his family, he
will feel, will have proved some-
thing to themselves and to the
world. And yet what has been
proved, beyond this?

Flowers we send to Grace Kelly
of Philadelphia, flowers to the
principality of Monaco. For they
have stood for something. What of
virginity, what of politics, of male
heirs, of an ancient ancestral tree
of royal blackguards?

Grace Kelly was a symbol to

Americans of something which it
is hardly necessary to define. It is
the -symbol which concerns us and
which we can see; the woman is
veiled in newsprint and celluloid.

Grace Kelly became overnight a
vogue; and in her betrothal, which /
came between sleeping and walk-
ing, the vogue crystallized into the
symbol. Garbo is unknown, and
Kelly will remain unknown, but
their function with regard to us is
the same and remains the same,
and nothing is more evident to us.

Garbo stood for glamour and
was glamour, but she was Swedish.
Dietrich was body and spirit and
publicity man, and she spelled
what was vital to us, but she was
German.

Keily shone suddenly before us
out of the postwar conflagration of
nerves, and was what we knew
better than what we wanted, and
she was from Philadelphia. Her
mother wore mink coats, and her
father had been a bricklayer. She
ascended the throne which had |
long been vacant, and became a
figurehead.

Now, she is an actress, but she
is more, Garbo was a finer ac-
tress, but she ruled the sama
realm, and the scepter is the same. |

Kelly is more than. Grace; Garbo
was no more than Greta, but Greta

is more. Flowers, then, also to Al-

fred Ilitcheock. And flowers to the
Prince of Monaco, despite his un-
pardonable faults: his height and
his good fortune.

Grace Kelly was a girl: in Phil-
adelphia when we fought the
Second World War and the Korean
War and when we dropped the
first atom bomb. But she was re-
served for a higher purpose, and
through her we know that we have
not changed, but that we are
American. It can still happen. And
we will buy newspapers and we
will go to the movies. And there
we will see something uniquely
American, whether flesh-and-blood
or whether more real than flesh-
and-blood. Or whether art.

In an existentialist world, mean-
ing is finally existentialist. Sartre
thought of the Jew writing at the
piano in a sultry Brooklyn flat on
a summer afternoon, and of the
Negro woman singing, when he
heard the worn gramophone rec-
ord. °

And this was all that was, be-
yond existence. Grace Kelly is. and
in a way in which the atom bomb
is not,

Frolics will be no exception.

There always is a friendly at-
mosphere created. by the natural-
ness of everyone. We appreciate
the Davidson tradition of a well-
dressed man, but we also like to
see you in Bermudas.

It_is the way you handle the
danees, the parties, the sings—it is
all this combined that makes us,
the girls, think of you, the boys, as
wonderful “Davidson Gentlemen.”

MARY LEWIS CRAIG
Salem College

The tradition of referring to the
Davidson College students as “Da-
vidson Gentlemen” has been justly
deserved; for to me, Davidson boys
are always gentlemen.

Their dress is strictly Ivy Lea-
gue and oh, those Bermuda shorts!
They really look collegiate. Ber-
mudas and Davidson Gentlemen
are definitely here to stay.

Is he smooth as glass, asphalt,
or sandpaper; What a question for
a “pinned” girl to answer!.T6 treat
this question fairly, I must gen-
eralize and say that they are as
“smooth as glass,” for they always
know what to do.in each particular
situation.

From all observations, Davidson
boys are excellent in their slow
dancing, but need to improve on
their fast dancing. There seems
to be more “watching the other
fellow’ bop than joining in with
the others.

In spite of the “a-mens" often
sung at the end of the Alma Mater,
[ consider Davidson Gentlemen
easily distinguished from other
college men; but perhaps I’m just
prejudiced.

Except for Bermudas (which I
object to on the grounds of bony

stuff.

The conversation is fascinating,
flattering, and above all, unlimit-
ed!

Whether at a picnic or a night
club, the Davidson Gentleman is
never at a loss for the best of
manners, It’s such a relief for a
girl to go vut with someone she
never has to worry about putting
his peas on the wrong knife!

Other than saying I’ve been pin-
ned to a Davidson Gentleman for
over two years and am going to
marry him this summer, I decline
to answer the question on romance
on the grounds that it might in-
criminate me.

HARRIETT HORD
Queens College

A Davidson Gentleman is truly a
gentleman in every respect.

His dress is always in the latest
style, whether it be pastels or
Ivy-league. And is he liked in Ber-
mudas? Yes, definitely, but not in
Burwell.

His conversation is “seasonal”—
in the fall, football, in the winter,
basketball, the spring, golf. But
also ranges’ from “Peanuts” to
deeper subjects.

Is he smooth? Evidently, yes! He
never lacks for a date.

How does he rate romantically?
Excellent!

A traveling salesman heading
south on Highway 21 rubbed his

Davidson’s campus dotted with
flowing, flowering prints escorted
by neatly-cut cotton-cord suits.

“Well, when I was at Carolina,”
rejoined the customer, “we opened

under pressure long before.”

“On the way, I passed a bus
with Sauter-Finegan plastered on
‘the side panels. Are they playing
around here this weekend?”

“Yes, after the Foolles, Fine-
