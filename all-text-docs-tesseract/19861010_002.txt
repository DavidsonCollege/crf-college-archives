Parade of new faculty continues

By AARON LEVINE
Lakshmanan Sabaratnam
One of the new faculty . at
Davidson this year is Sri Lankan
Lakshmanan Sabaratnam, _ in-
structor of Sociology. His spe-
cialty is inequality in society.

Sabaratnam had many good
things to say of the Davidson fac-
ulty, especially the sociology de-
partment: “Their experience com-
pliments my experience.” He
especially likes the_ non-tradi-
tional point of view of many of the
department members, such as an
expertise in Meso American or
third world “life.” In his eyes,
Davidson students are better than
many other students he has taught
in America. They are “motivated”
and “serious.” He also points out:
“Davidson is close to places |
know back home, the town
matches small community life |

can dissent openly but that there is

a measure of concern for everyone
+} else,” Kuykendall said.
Although the Board will make

plans for the college’s budget for

1987-88 in February, Kuykendall
said the Board will not necessarily
act on the committee's recom-
mendation at that time. He noted
that modifications can be made in
the budget with respect to any
change in investments at any time
before July 1, 1987 at which time
the budget goes into effect.

am familiar with.” Sabaratnam
also. likes the access to the “re
search triad” in northern North
Carolina.

Sabaratnam received his B.A.
at the University of Ceylon (now
Sri Lanka) in 1974, and his M.A.
and Ph.D. at the University of
Washington at Seattle in 1978 and
1984 respectively. Having had
visiting appointments at the Uni-
versity of Washington, Portland
State (Oregon) and the University
of Puget Sound (Washington) be-
fore coming to Davidson,
Sabaratnam is teaching Introduc-
tory Sociology and Comparative
Approaches to the American fam-

ily.

Some of his hobbies are read-
ing and yen meditation. An Angli-
can, Sabaratnam states that the
“formality of the church service
and many aspects of the Christian
religion drove me to look for more
personal satisfaction. I thought I
needed to find a way to calm my-
self and discipline my mind.” Yen
is an idea that can be applied to
varied religions.

Dr. William-Ringle

In the restructuring of the
soaiology/anthropology départ-
ment at Davidson for this year,
one of the new: professors joining
the department is Dr. William
Ringle, a professional ar-
cheologist specializing in the pre-
history of Meso America.

This term he is teaching An-
thropology 101 and 107. This is
his first major teaching post, hav-
ing worked in a lab setting for a
number of years.

Presently Ringle is involved
with a project centering around
of the Mayan archeological site of
Ek Balan near Valladolid in the
Yucatan of Mexico. Itis a survey
project with Tulane; he hopes
Davidson can be involved with it
as well some day. One question he
is trying to answer is “why did the
city have walls?”

Ringle would like to have an
archeology lab established at
Davidson in the future, saying that
“archeology is valuable because it
provides a perspective on man a
thousand times longer than his-
tory. The field allows people of
any interest to participate.” He
even mentioned the future possi-
bility of a SYA in Meso America:
“It is safer to walk the street of
Yucatan than of Charlotte.”

A native of New Orleans,
Ringle obtained his B.A. in
Humanities from Johns Hopkins,
his M.A. in anthropology and his
Ph.D. in 1985 from Tulane. When
asked why he went for a
Humanities degree, Ringle men-
tioned that Johns Hopkins did not
have an anthropology department,
and that the field of archeology
can draw many different types of
expertise, including that of the lib-
eral arts.

Shaw Smith
Dr. Shaw Smith, professor of
art history, returns to Davidson
after a two-year absence, during
which he taught at the University
of Denver.

Smith received a B.A. in En-
glish and an M.A. and Ph.D. in art
history at the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill before
studying at the Sorbonne, where
he specialized in 19th century
French art, especially the work of

Eugene Delacroix, Smith earned a
post-doctoral fellowship at Yale
University’s British Art Center.
The author of a book on the work
of Luis Francia. Smith will con-
tribute an article next year to a
French retrospective on Francia.

Smith tries to encourage his
students to realize that “art is not
merely beautiful, it is powerful.”
His particular interest is the re-
lationship between art and poli-
tics, which he calls the “social ap-
proach” to art.

Although Smith enjoyed his
sojourn in Denver and will miss
watching the Denver Broncos,
who he predicts will go to the
Super Bowl, he is glad to be back
at Davidson. He approves of re-
cent administrative changes, and
he notes with a smile, “The stu-
dents don’t change — they’re al-
ways good.”

1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

‘Catherine Martinengo

Dr. Catherine Martinengo ar-
rived in the United States for the
first time on September 2, but she
has adjusted easily to life at
Davidson.

‘Martinengo, who comes from
. France, eamed a -
B.A..in French and an M.A. iner-
gonomics at the University of
Montpelier. She then completed
her Ph.D. at the Sorbonne. Her
specialty is teaching linguistics to

foreigners, and she has spent the
last nine years teaching intensive
language courses at several uni-
versities; most recently she was in
Switzerland at Eurocentre, an in-
ternationally know language spe-
cialty school.

Martinengo has adapted read-
ily to Davidson, although she
finds some things, such as a li-
brary that stays open until 1:00
a.m., “very astonishing.” Mar-
tinengo notes that students at
Davidson are more concerned
with success and grades than their
French counterparts.

She also remarks that students
here frequently yawn and seem
exhausted. “At first, was afraid it
was my class,” she says smiling
wisely as she adds, “But I think
there are many other papers and
subjects to do.”
