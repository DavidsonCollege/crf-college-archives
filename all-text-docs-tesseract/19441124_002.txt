Thanksgiving...

Thanksgiving isa time to pause. Be-
hind it 1s a significance which is not found
in other holidays. As our custom and as
a spirit among people it, is unique in our
nation, We know its origin and practice
well. Since childhood we have anticipated
that day of feasting and making merry.

Although Thanksgiving is among the
youngest holidays which are celebrated in
a nation so wholeheartedly, it has under-
gone a change in its meaning to the indi-
vidual. Due to the change in national
life we have made a change of spirit in
the celebration. This has been necessary
to keep alive the heartfelt fervor which
must go with an occasion of this sort. In
« truth we have the Old Thanksgiving and
the New Thanksgiving.

In the old we have the beauty of tradi-
tion, the inheritance of our forefathers
who brought in the harvest and then paus-

ed to thank God for his bounty. This was.

the Thanksgiving when all the richness
of autumn season combined with all the
richness of the fields and flocks to make
a-day when we could be conscious of our
material blessings. It was a pageant of
the soil that sustained our families and
our nation.

Now “when we are no longer conscious
as a nation of our closeness to the soil and
our dependence upon it for existence, our
idea based upon this situation must neces+
sarily change. We have not lost our spirit
of thankfulness but its sources have been
altered.

They in the past based their cause for
thanks upon material blessings; we not
entirely for these, but for more intangible
blessings. We have the whole spirit of
a people for which to give thanks. This

is not lost even when the material bles-
sing'’s are not so much in evidence.

For those who realize the truth of this
spirit, Thanksgiving rises above a day of
feasting to a sacremental celebration of
the goodness of God to the nation. Even
if the material wealth should vanish and
times become bitter and hard we still have
cause to fold our hands and lift our eyes

heaven and offer a prayer, for that
which we have is an immeasurable bless-
ing of life.

Gunning Around

With sincere apoligies to Robert
Browning and to those who profess a

‘knowledge of the dramatic monolog, there

follows such a slaughter of that literary
form. that its author is being considered
as a possible recipient for this year’s
Puzzler Prize. Any resemblance to room-
mates past or present, living or dead, is
purely intentional.

Among those who had it

Tom Smith who didn’t darken Geor-

he couldn't darken the door anyway.
Alf Scarborough had a fine time un-

some very interesting observations
to be made. Before we start I

would like to know what happened
to Pash Medford and Fritz Keesler
to persuade them to go stag.

Hil Maters was seen at the dance
with any girl but his date. She sat
on the side while he? danced the
night away. Quote: “The only
dances I enjoyed were when I
danced with Glo and Pat”

Gabby seemed to get along fine
with Glo but he says that vat is
his last dance with a date.

Someone asked McArn where his
date was. He replied, “How should

Medford was stuck with her.”

After the dance Patterson was
pulled for ‘driving drunk’. Or at
least*he didn’t have his mind on his
driving. I can’t imagine what he
was doing!!

L. G. Turner, Jack McLeod, Bob
Huntly, and Bob Hoffman swear
that there is nothing like taking
your dates to Charlotte for break-
fast on Sunday morning after stay-
ing up all night. Waters says that

there is only one thing better: to |

get in at six and then get up at
seven and do your lessons with
your girl.

This Might
Be You

By HIL,MASTERS

Since the beginning of time wo-
men have puzzled and ruined men.
Take for instance Anthony and
Cleopatra. Anthony tried to figure
Cleopatra out, but he failed (he had
a heck of a good’time trying to do-
it though). Here are
amples of the queer
women.

several ex-

reasonings of

John and Mary have been going
together for almost a year when
Mary takes it into her head that
she will be fickle. Poor John. does-
n't know exactly what has come over
his “loved” one. He is thrown into
a desparaté¢ state watching his girl
making eyes at all the other boys
and overhearing her remarks about
different fellows. What does that
equal—one bewildered and disillus-
ioned boy.

This type of girl is commonly call-
ed the “héart-breaker.’ She makes
a man think she is madly in love
with him. This can be accomplished
in many ways: by looking at him
in that “you great big, strong man”
stare; by murmuring sweet things
in his ear; straightening his tie or
adjusting his coat, and even laugh-
ing at his jokes. After a period of
time,.so destined by her, she com-
pletely ignores him and starts ‘“mes-
sing around another guy.” Now the
question arises, what pleasure does
she get from this? There are sev-
eral possible answers to this. She
may get joy just from doing this to
the male concerned, alone or. she
may do this in order to get to the
movies free. Who knows?

This is really the most dangerous
type of all. After several dates she
tells people her male is practically
swooning at her feet and that he is
wrapped around her little finger.
This is most embarrassing for the
boy involved for everywhere he
goes, females giggle and males call
him a “stupe.” But,what can he do:
He is. trapped. His word against
hers.
