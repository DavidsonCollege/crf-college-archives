John Wilson McConnell was ‘born at
McConnellsville, S. C., in 1878. Enter-
ing Davidson in 1898, he graduated with
the B.S. degree in 1902, having won the
Debater’s and Declaimer’s medals. In
1905 he received the M.A. degree. He
studied medicine at the North Carolina
Medical College, which was then lo-
cated at Davidson. His medical work
was continued at the University of
Maryland.

In 1907, having received his M.D., he
became house surgeon at the Presbyterian
Eye and Ear Hoépital, in Baltimore. He
held this position until in the fall of
1908 he began his work as Professor of
Biology and Physical Training. .

In 1916 Dr. McConnell served on the
Mexican border. In 1917 he was a cap-
tain in the Medical corps at Camp Jack-
son,

He went to France in 1918, and was
promoted to the rank of major, and later
to that of lieutenant colonel. On the
15th of May, 1919, he again reached
America. Since then, though still in the
service, he has visited Davidson fre-
quently.

Because of his absence since the end of
the college year 1916-17, Dr. McCon-
nell is not well known personally to
many students now on the hill except
those who entered with the present Se-
nior class, To all of them he is a well-
known personal friend; to all who have
been interested in the college in recent
years he is recognized as having per-
formed «a very distinctive and valuable
service to it.

Being Xtill in the service, Dr. McCon-
nell is not filling his place this year. It
is a pleasant anticipation, however, that
in the future he will again be a part of
the active faculty.
