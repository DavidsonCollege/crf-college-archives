DORM ENHANCES FACILITIES
Courts Dim Improvement

By GEOFF BIRKHEAD

Davidsonian Sprots Writer

This past semester the Dav-
idson College Athletic Depart-
ment expanded its facilities to
meet the need for more hand-
ball courts and better accommo-
dations for visiting track and
football teams.

The new athletic dorm which
is located inside the east stands
of the football stadium is large
and comfortable. Student train-
er Sam Bradley remarked that
“There is room for about 60
beds and the room is a great

SAYS COSTS CUT
Currie Defends Expenses

(An Analysis)

By TOM COOK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

“We did more things than
we planned. to, and we di

them because they cost less:

to do now.”

Thus Business Manager Rob-
ert Currie explained the recent-
ly criticized expenditures for
athletic improvements in’ 1965-
66. These expenditures have
been criticized as being out of
proportion to the estimates re-
vealed in THE DAVIDSONIAN
on May 19, 1965.

The first action on this pro-
gram of improvements occurred
in the spring of 1965. President
D. G. Martin approached the
Richardsons, who originally
gave the money to build the
football stadium, about making
needed improvements on that
stadium. The improvements he
had in mind cost $100,000.

From the Richardson Founda-
tion, Martin got $50,000 for the
improvements. But the total
Richardson project cost $120,000,
a figure which included the con-
struction of an athletic dormi-
tory, two dressing rooms and
restrooms under the east grand-
stand. Included in these im-
provements were work on west

stands’ rest rooms, press box,
_

stadium appearance and seats.
$50,000 FROM GIFTS

The basic reason this addi-

jtional construction was done

was because, with this addition,

d the cost of the projected expan-

sion of the Johnston Gymnasium
will be considerably reduced.

More space for dressing rooms
was needed in the gym, and this
could only be accomplished
through expansion of the gym.
And with the addition of Charles
Parker as another trainer, more
training space was needed. The
cheapest and best solution was
to make the necessary construc-
tion under the east stands, thus
converting the little-used dormi-
tory in the gym into training
space, thus making the eventual
gymnasium addition require no
plumbing.

ATHLETIC SURPLUS

When a surplus in the athletic
budget appeared, a decision was
reached to move the baseball
facilities where it would not
double as a parking lot, so there
would be no conflict with fall
practice.

The new baseball field cost
approximately $13,500, most of
which was internally absorbed.
The old field will be divided
into a paved parking lot and an
intramural field.

While the grading equipment

HATTIE'’S

“ust the up road ..”

was here, it was decided to
build the new, much neéded in-
tramural field below the soccer
field, which is now the best of
the four. It cost $9,500.

$20,000 FROM DUKE

As this was proceeding, the
Duke Endowment gave David-
son $20,000 for new tennis courts.
These courts could have been
built for that price on the soccer
field, but since dirt was being
moved from the new intramural
field, it was in the interests of
all factors to spend an additional
$12,000 for saving the soccer
field and build the courts in
their present location north of
the gym.

It has been implied that sub-
sidized athletics was the cause
of these expenditures. This is
not the case, according to Mr.
Currie. Subsidized athletics does
not mean a stadium can be left
to rot and that athletic improve-
ments will be nil. The only ex-
penditure which can be attribut-
ed to subsidized athletics is the
$20,000 spent to replace the old
press box.

GENERAL BENEFIT

Mr. Currie noted that every
other expenditure and renova-
tion was to the benefit of the
general student body. “‘At the
time of the decisions,” Currie
stated, ‘it seemed the best use
of the dollars we had. It just

improvement over the accommo.

The transformation of unused
space into a modern athletic
dorm was accomplished by en-
closing the space found beneath
the stands. This new accom-
plishment is another phase of
the recent. improvement in the
athletic facilities of Richardson
Field,

The other improvements are
the six outdoor handball courts.
Used almost exclusively by the

PE classes during the spring .

months, the courts have drawn
few other players. The stu-

dent opinion is that it is bet. ;

ter to wait in line to play on
the old indoor courts than to
play on the outdoor courts.

Sophomore Cliff Wheeler said,
“Most of the actual playing time
is taken up by chasing the ball
past the back line and eluding
the support posts between the
courts." He also added, “The

the. situation.”

The game itself is radically
different on the ouldoor courts.
The ceiling, which ‘consists of
the step-like undersides of the
football stands, is ruled out-of-
bounds. The side walls which
are used to increase the speed
and angle of the ball extend
only half the length of the court

which itself is smaller than any.

of the indoor courts.

In addition to these dimen
sional differences, the hardness
of the concrete floor has forced

fitted in, and it was cheaper too,
then.”

The question of comparison of
library improvements should be
briefly considered. A new library
will be needed in five years. The
present structure was made
adequate for five more years
by the expenditure of $25,000 to
renovate and develop the Bab-
cock Wing. This is what the
library requested.

Currie emphasized, ‘‘To my
knowledge. there is no request
they (the library) has made that
has not been filled. They have
more money for books than they
can use.”

So the conclusion of this report
is that the severe criticisms of
the athletic expenditures are un-
justified. They were long range
improvements. The cost reduc-
tions were considerable.

From the comparison of years, it is not hard to see
we improved in football and soccer, and declined sig-
nificantly in cross country, wrestling and track. Overall,
we declined in wins, but here it's best to apply the old
adage: “It’s not whether you win or lose, just so you win
the conference tournament.” Amen.
