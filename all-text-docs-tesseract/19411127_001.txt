Mr. Whitaker is a personal friend

Mussolini about it.

Italians Change
Mussolini explained that the Ital-
ian policy -has changed because of
the rise in power of the German
State. Several years ago he had
defied the Germans to extend their

posseSsions southward, but today
he encouraged them to do so. “This
was because he, wanted to be on the
side of Hitler who he felt would

conquer the world. Mr. Whitaker

this time he had risen because people
believed he could give them the
things he wanted. Now he real-
ized that he could not fulfill the
promises and have his power too
so he put to death four hundred
important Germans who could have
overthrown him.

Mr. Whitaker told how Hitler's
government made war profitable.
The plunder they got from other
countries was more than the cost
the armament program. This
is one reason why the Nazi form of
government has succeeded.

for discussion. Mr. Whitaker said
that at first the English had been

thought there was need of rearm-
