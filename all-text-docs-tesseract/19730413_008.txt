Subsidized Football: Pros And Cons

CRISIS IN ATHLETICS:

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

(Ed. Note: This is the second
article in the continuing series
on the athletic crisis at David-
son. In light of the Open End
discussion held Tuesday night,
the topic of this installment will
be on the status of football and
the problems of having a sub-
sidized and nonsubsidized
program here.)

There is a lingering question
on this campus as to whether or
not Davidson should have a sub-
sidized football program.

Trying to answer such a
question involves quite a few
different aspects, along with
some very careful analysis as to
the problem itself.

One of the prevailing opinions
is that Davidson should take im-
mediate steps to desubsidize its
football program.

Initially people mention the
fact that the football program
netted the school a loss of ap-
proximately $160,000 last year.
Basketball, of course, lost close
to $140,000 in the same annum.
The reason for dropping foot-
ball as opposed to basketball,
then, seems to be its poorer
record.

The question remains as to
whether or not Davidson could
ever produce a winning and
money-making football
program.

First, one must analyze what
it takes to build a major college
football team that would be
nationally prominent.

The first requirement would
be a student enrollment which
included from 120-150 football
players. At Davidson this would
constitute approximately 11
percent of the present student
body. It would most likely
require lowering the academic
standards to allow enough good
football players to gain ad-
mittance.

It would also be necessary to
increase the money allotted for
scholarships, which would send
the budget spiraling for the first
few years of the new program.

Then the problems really
begin to.appear.

Davidson would need a new
football stadium that would seat
from 45,000 to 80,000 people.
This is necessary due to the
inability to profit from sellouts
in small stadiums such as
Richardson Field or Charlotte
Memorial.

A Davidsonian Analysis

football program at Davidson
which would have access to
national prominence.

Those were the essential
requirements that Dave Fagg,
present coach of the Wildcat
football team, was implying
Tuesday night when he said, ‘‘If
football was given the same
proportion of support and
material that the basketball
team had for three or four years
and did not build a comparable
team, then I would personally
leave the program.”

It is quite obvious however,
that the present financial
situation of the college cannot
support a program sueh as this.
Thus it seems unfair to com-
pare the won-lost records of the
two scholarshiped sports when
suggesting which should lose its
subsidization.

A second argument that has
been advanced is whether or not
subsidized athletics in general
has kept worthy students away
from the campus due to a lack
of financial aid available.

This appears to be quite a
convincing idea except for one
point: supposedly everyone ac-
cepted at this college is a
qualified student under the ad-
missions standards.

William Miller, assistant
director of admissions and
financial aid, upheld this point
by saying that ‘‘There are no
double standards for the ac-
ceptance of students, athletic or
not,” as potential entrants at
Davidson.

Athletes admitted here are
sent through the same stan-
dards as any other student. It
should be noted that a person
who plays athletics here is just
as much a student as anyone
else.

Then the argument for the
financial aspects comes into the
limelight once again. It is.
however, a misrepresentation
of the facts to say that a non-
subsidized program will cost
less than the present subsidized
one.

Vice President for Finance
and Development David Cornell
expressed this view.

“1 really do not think we can play in the Southern Con-

ference if we do not subsidize football. If you are going to
play with those who believe it is worth paying for, you

have to pay yoursel if.”

Then the school would need to
at least double the present foot-
ball stafff, as well as doubling
the salaries of coaches
associated with a nationally
prominent football team.

The recruiting budget would
have to be reproduced many
times over to get enough quality
players to build such a football
program.

If all of these prerequisites
materialized, along with
enough worthy opponents to
compete with the Cats and draw
the support to fill a stadium
seating 50,000 plus every other
Saturday afternoon (students
would ceded have to pay

also), then there would be a

“I am not sure that this
‘established fact’ of a cheaper
nonsubsidized program is not a
falacy,’’ he said. ‘‘We have a
study underway to compare our

costs with some of the schools —

which have a nonsubsidized
program. It should be in-
teresting to see the results.”’

It is fairly certain that there
would be some loss from alumni
giving, which would affect the
Wildcat Fund. Sandy Carnegie,
executive director of this fund-
raising organization, followed
this line of thought.

“I think that we would
initially lose a sum of money if
we went to a desubsidized
program,”’ he stated. ‘‘I cannot

say for sure what the long-
range effects of this move
would be. We could begin to get
the lost donations back or we
could lose them for good. It is
just too hard to pinpoint at this
time."

Cornell also pointed out that
not only would the financial
aspects of alumni relations be
impaired but that alumni
relations in general could be
hurt.

“It is something that you
have to look at in a total
prospective,’’ Cornell _ in-

Fagg feels that subsidization
is a mandatory requirement for
staying within the boundaries of
the Southern Conference.

“I think if you are going to
compete with those who feel
that football is worth paying
for, then you are going to have
to pay also,"’ the head coach
commented.

The question then arises as to
whether or not the college
should stay in the conference.
Looking at the advantages, the
best place to start is with the so-
called minor sports.

“Tam not certain that a nonsubsidized football
program will cost the college any less than a subsidized
one. This is one of the fallacies in the monetary argument
against football subsidation.~

dicated. ‘It is just a matter of
what our priorities are."’

There is also the harm that
would possibly come to the
other sports in the athletic
program at Davidson, should
the football team lose its sub-
Sidy.

of we pointed out that number

football scholarshiped
layers participate on other

teams. He specifically men-
tioned baseball, track and
wrestling.

Beyond this lose would also be
a possible loss of the money now
given the other sports by the
Wildcat Fund. Carnegie said
that these other teams receive
“around 20-25 percent of the
Wildcat Fund budget.”

Then there appears the ob-
vious alternative for the strict
economist. That alternative is
to simply reduce the sport of
football to the club level.

This leads to the reasons for
keeping football as a financially
supported program at the
college.

In track, wrestling, tennis,
golf, swimming and other in-
dividual sports, there are in-
dividual championships at the
close of the season which should
be taken into consideration.

If the college were to go in-
dependent, then these season-
ending tournaments would be
lost for the sports which could
not get bids to the national post
season tourneys.

An independent status could
also be detremental to the suc-
cess of basketball on the
national level. There would be
no automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament for the cagers,
which would be automatic with
a Southern Conference crown.

It would take an at-large in-
vitation, which in the East is
getting hard tocome by.

Baseball also gets a _ post
season bid, if they are able to
capture the regular season title
in the conference.

Thus, by going independent,
there is a sacrifice of the post
season opportunities for the
majority of the sports.

This was the feeling of Scott
recently when he said. ‘‘We
would lose a goal for the season
in most sports. I think that
being independent would not
serve a good purpose for David-
son,”’ he said.

There is also the possibility of
moving to the Carolinas Con-
ference. Here the football
program, as well as most other
sports, would have a better
chance at being successful.

The flaws to a move such as
this include a drop from major
college (NCAA) to small college
(NAIA) athletics, as well as a
definite sacrifice in academic
standards, which is supposedly

the major goal of Davidson
College in the first place.

Scott felt that a move toward
the Carolinas Conference would
indeed be ‘academically bad
and quite a drop” overall.

The alternatives to subsidized
football are not especially
feasable for Davidson at this
time.

While being obviously out-
classed on the football field,
primarily due to the lack of
money, the school would not
gain a great deal financially by
going to a_ nonsubsidized
program, which would also
mean leaving the Southern Con-
ference.

The question is very com-
plicated and tricky. For in a
very real sense, the deficit in
which football is working may
be the hope, as far as remaining
in the SC, for the other sports.

CORNELL

It may eventually boil down
to whether or not Davidson
wants to. sacrifice their
academic standards for a better
football program, which is
highly unlikely, desubsidize
football and play outside the
conference, which would
sacrifice many other sports, or
continue to work with a sub-
sidized football program, con-
tinuing at an expense of $160,000
or so per year for the sake of
remaining in the Southern Con-
ference and being competitive
in quite a few other sports.

The question demands quite a
bit more than a simple won-lost
record or a lump sum of money
that could easily be lost
anyway.

(Next Week: The third part of
the series will hopefully focus
on the aspects of the unsubsi-
dized or minor sports. We hope
to examine the problems that

‘they are encountering with the

rising costs of recruiting, equip-
ment, competition, travel ex-
penses, etc. and how they are
attempting to solve them with
regard to the present crisis in
athletics.)
