The Davidsonian

R@ligion provides intangible asset

During the incident itvolving Chri-
stian tenure last spring, national
attention was focused upon Davidson
as a religiously affiliated institution.
While the community struggled to
reach a solution to this controversy,
the students, faculty and administra-
tion continuously affirmed one thing:
the desire to keep Davdison’s religi-
ous commitment. Yet, how is this
commitment, which seems to be so
keenly recognized and appreciated,
manifested within the college com-
munity itself? !

“At Davidson, Christian commit-
ment has been a very sustained
attempt to maintain an institution of

genuine academic excellence and at

the same time, a genuine Christian
emphasis,’’ say Dean of Students
Will H. Terry.

Professor of Religion Daniel
Rhodes elaborated: ‘‘Davidson has al-
ways worked on the assumption that
faith and reason should go hand in
hand. It’s the division, the tension
between the best of mind and the best
in terms of faith that we’re trying to
put together.”

In the past, outward signs of
Davidson's Christian commitment
could be found in mandatory chapel,
vespers and certain required religion
courses.

“The most overt positive influence
occurred when the church overtured
the move to become an integrated
institution,’’ continued Rhodes. ‘‘The
student body was opposed at the
time, but the next year, the faculty
picked it up and asked the Trustees to
go all the way.”

tian faith.’”’

“The problem students have and
the problem the church has is that
they have concrete ideas and expecta-
tions of how a college articulates its
Christian commitment,‘ added Ter-
ry. ‘‘A lot of people in the church look
for the viable signs of the Christian
college, while some students see the
church connection as an obstacle to
academic excellence and national
prestige.”’

“Yet here, our approach is differ-
ent- we use it as a basis from which we
operate,’’ Terry stated. ‘‘It is expres-
sed in policy-making by the adminis-
tration and trustees with Christian
implications in mind; through excel-
lence—for in settling for mediocrity,
we betray our faith as our goal; by
raising issues out of a sense of
Christian commitment, such as the
way we spend our resources; and in
the concern exhibited particularly in
student-faculty relations.

Rhodes echoed, ‘‘When it tomes
right down to it, there are a lot of
things we take for granted— more
specifically, the relationship between

faculty and students. I tend to think

it reflects the religious commitment.”

“The YMCA also involves action
that transcends the classroom and
allows students to do something
expressing a concern for one’s fellow
man. These students are responding
to an ideal we’re setting of a good
liberal arts college that upholds its
Christian commitment,” concluded
Rhodes.

Davidson is also aided financially
through its religious affiliations. |

Melton summarized,:‘‘There is no
evidence one way or the other that we
were affected by the Christian tenure
controversy in terms of monetary
support. Of course, the alumni would
be the least affected by adverse
newspaper reporting. All in all,
Davidson has the best of both worlds:

and total absence of Church control.”’

Will Terry concluded, ‘‘I can’t see
why we can’t use the Lindon incident
to grow, to sharpen our focus of what
we really want to be about. For as the
culture becomes more secularized,
we’re going to have to work like the
dickens to keep our Christian com-
mitment. But if we can pull it off, we
will provide a very viable alterna-
tive.”

Rhodes as 1) the Davidson adminis-
tration’s defense of the policy to
accept Communist speakers on cam-
pus (At the time, there was a
‘hullabaloo’ at UNC and the NC
legislature ‘‘was up in arms” over the
question) and 2) the invitation of an
evangelical atheist to speak and carry
on a debate with Dr. Earl MacCormac
several years ago.

“Now the focus on Christian cor-
mitment is subtler,’’ states Terry.
‘With it becoming manifest in the
atmosphere created, it’s a basis from
which we operate.’’*

“It’s an intangilbe asset that our
relationship with the church has
provided,” said Archivist Chalmers
Davidson. ‘‘Intangible in that it’s
given Davidson a character of its
own; unique in a way which relates
directly to personal integrity of its
graduates.”

In regards to how the Christian
commitment is implemented, Rhodes
responded, ‘“‘The obvious things are
not here that students can ignore such
as chapel and vespers. Students can
go through here without consciously
feeling the impact of Christian com-
mitment. And we don’t always repre-

port,’’ said Duane Dittman, Vice-Pre-
‘sident of Development. Julius Mel-
ton, Director of Special Resources
added, ‘‘In the budgeted gifts from
the Presbyterian synod of North
Carolina, Davidson is pledged
$65,000. In one respect this amount
makes up less than 1 percent of our
budget, and yet on the other hand, it
represents 10 percent of the annual
giving support. It’s not something we
want to throw to the wind.”

‘“‘One can’t measure the more
important individual gifts to college
because of Christian commitment,”’
maintained Ditman. ‘Yet one exam-
ple occurred yesterday; we received
correspondence from an alumnus who
had been withholding long-range
commitment. He stated that he was
now reassured that Davidson does not
want to become a secularized institu-
tion and wants to make a substantial,
sacrificial commitment to the college
over the next five years.”

‘‘We’re also able to attract gifts
because Davidson is an institution
that honors its heritage. This aspect
provides a stability and
that wavering doesn’t hold,” added
Ditman. ‘‘We don’t confuse people
about what we are.’’ .

Spring, 1977: A Jewish
professor from New Jersey,
candidate for an opening in
Davidson’s Political Science
Department, declares that he
cannot in good conscience
“uphold and seek to increase
the college’s effectiveness as a
church-related college,’’ as the
Trustee By-Laws demand that
he do.

Davidson rescinds its job
offer from the professor, and
students join with faculty in a
boycott of Convocation to
express their opposition to the
discriminatory By-Law—a
By-Law which seems to dis-
courage the hiring of non-
Christians at Davidson.

“Real-world” media men in-
vade the campus and write
articles hinting that Davidson
is anti-semitic. The Trustees
gather and claim that the
college has been unfairly ac-
cused.

“Davidson does not exclude
non-Christians from its facul-
.ty,”’ say the Trustees, and to
prove it they fashion a more
liberal-sounding By-Law and
pass it on first reading. That
sets the stage for final appro-
val at the Trustées’ October
meeting. After then, all will
see that Davidson’s doors are
open to those who can ‘‘work
with respect for the Christian
tradition even if they cannot

lege...”

Sounds great, doesn’t it?

quated notions, moves into

and search for truth. Yes, it
sounds great, but it is not

true. The Trustees sold out at’

the October meeting, and
there is no ‘‘new era’’ at
Davidson.

The Trustees did pass the
new By-Law. It explains why§

the faculty, but does not
explain why the college wants
non-Christians; thus, it div-

ides Christians and non-Chris-#

tians into ‘‘sheep and goats’
camps.

words. Undeniably, in black
and white, the By-Law states:
“The President is also author-
ized to recommend for ap-
pointment as officers and fac-
ulty members non-Christian
persons..

So hey did the Trustees sell
out?

Along with the new By-Law
the Trustees passed another
statement—call it an ‘‘enact-
ing statement’’—that in my
opinion effectively dilutes and
may even supplant the new
By-Law.

Resolved, that paragraph 5 of Article IV be and it hereby is
amended to read as follows:

5. It is natural and desirable that the educational service of a
church-related College should be carried forward from one
generation to another by persons committed to the Christian
faith. The Christian commitment of a church-related College is
reflected not only in its corporate policies, programs, and

,.. stewardship of resources, but especially in the individuals who
make up its community. For that reason, the President is
authorized to recommend for appointment as officers and

Faculty members Christian men and women who are not only —

highly competent but who understand and respond to the
implications of their commitment as Christians. The President
is also authorized to recommend for appoint ee officers and

Faculty members non-Christian persons who can work with

respect for the Christian tradition even if they cannot
conscientiously join it, and who can live in harmony with the

purpose of the College as set forth in the Davidson College
Constitution. ;
