‘Keen Jean ’ Revisited

The current procedure of electing students to the
Hearing Committee (Honor Council) tugs candidates
towards imbecility, insults voters, and enfeebles the
Honor Code it purports to perpetuate.

A stofl through the dormitory halis this week was a
depressing experience. “Vote for Bob, he’s no slob;” “We
need Jean, she’s real keen.” And for those not. drawn to
pithy mottos, there was the time-hon standby: “Vote
for Joe Student, Freshman for g Committee”...
“Vote for Jane Student, Sophomore for Hearing
Committee”...“Vote for Jim Student, Junior Hearing
Committee”...

We exaggerate, perhaps, but not by much.

Candidates stick platforms onto the doors of the johns.
One john looks like another. One platform looks like
another.

- “The Honor Code is Davidson's most precious
institution, a cornerstone of the unique sense of
community we all enjoy. | am an honest fair-minded
.Student. Elect me to the Hearing Committee and | will
defend our Honor Code.”

Daft slogans are scrawled on poster-board and pasted
on the walls. They fall and are trampled on. Election day
comes, the vote is cast, some hopefuls win.

Good sense and the Honor Code lose.

Davidson’s most cherished institution deserves better
treatment.

The current selection process is unfair to the
candidates: while popular, well-known students need
only post their names to win, lesser-knowns, desperately
seeking name identity, must embrace tacky slogans.

Platform originality is almost’impossible.

The current selection process is unfair to the voters,
who have little substantive information on which to make
an intelligent decision.

The current selection process is unfair to the Honor
Code itself.

At a time when some claim that the Code is crumbling
away, we hasten its demise by electing its defenders in a
circus-sideshow atmosphere.

We ask the Hearing Committee and the SGA to spare us
from Bob Slob and Keen Jean and Joe, Jim, and Jane
Student. Work together to give us a new, more sensible

Hearing Committee selection process.
Philip Duncan in The Davidsonian, December 15, 1978.

Unfortunately, the situation remains basically the
same. Just yesterday afternoon we saw a poster
proclaiming that a candidate was in favor of honesty.
While we are not questioning the candidate’s sincerity,
we must doubt if honesty will be a hotly disputed issue in
the coming election. The statement contributes nothing
to one’s knowledge of this candidate.

The only way a student can vote intelligently in. ‘an
Honor Council election is by knowing all of the
candidates involved personally. Qualities like honesty,
sound judgment, and strong character are obviously
among the most desirable in an Honor Council member.
The degree to which a candidate has these attributes
cannot be conveyed by a poster, and it would be very
unfair and impractical to expect every student to meet
each candidate. :

Yet it doesn’t seem too much to ask that the members
of the old Honor Council, or Student Conduct Council
and Honor Council members together, interview each of
the candidates and select the Council’s new members
themselves. (Those members running for re-election
would not, of course, make decisions on their
opponents.) A panel of Student Conduct Council and
Honor Council members already interviews each possible
candidate and must give its approval before any hopeful
is allowed to run.

The current Honor Councii selection process serves no
one well—voter or candidate. We hope that the SGA and
the Honor Council will work together to establish a new

process, The selection decisions should be made by a
well-informed committee, not blamelessly ignorant

Permission Not Granted

‘Yo the Editor:

Concerning Robert Bowie’s
campaign letter distributed last
Monday (March 24, 1980), it
has come to our attention that
there was a flagrant misuse of
the names of endorsement. Al-

though our names were listed

among those endorsing Bowie,
we were not asked if our names
could be used, nor did we give
permission for such use. We
have nothing against Mr. Bowie
but we do not stand behind
many of the issues in his
platform, and we resent the
public use of our names in such
a manner.

An Apology

To the Editor:

The Robert T. Bowie for SGA
President Committee would like
to extend its sincerest apologies
to Messrs. Warren Overbey and
Bruce Wallace. Their names
were listed on one of our flyers
as supporters of the Bowie
campaign. We made the unfor-
tunate assumption that their
private endorsements of Mr.
Bowie warranted our using their
names on the flyer. This was a
mistake. Again we wish to
apologize for our error and we
hope no feelings or careers have
been hurt.

Baseball GPA

To the Editor:

We are writing concerning
the publication of the sports
teams’ grade point averages in a
recent Davidsonian. Upon read-
ing what seemed to be the
greatly mistaken team GPA of
the baseball squad, several of us
inquired into how the SGA
committee came up with their
figures. At first we got conflic-
ting reports about how it was

‘done, but eventually we were

told that the fall term GPAs of

all those people who tried out

for the team were averaged to
come up with the 2.61 GPA
that was reported. We’re not
sure they figured this right, but
at any rate it should be noted
that many of these people who’
tried out didn’t even make the
team: This fact renders the

SGA finding unviable. We also
contend that figuring the GPAs
from a single term is not
indicative of a whole lot. If we
may be allowed a little editorial
ripple, it seems the SGA’s
methods were ridiculous, and
possibly bordering on the farci-
cal.

We would like to state some
facts concerning our GPAs that
are figured out correctly and
include only people on the team.
First of all, the average GPA
for the team this winter was
3.21. Three members of the
team got 4.0 averages this
winter. Furthermore, only 5
team members got below 3.0. If
you take the 5 who got below
3.0 out of the average, the
average comes to over 3.6.

We just wanted to straighten
a few things out and suggest to
the SGA that they ought to do
things right when they do them.

Libertarians

To the Editor:

This letter contains both a
complaint and an announce-
ment. First, the complaint:

The Davidsonian’s failure to
cover the Forum held here
recently for the Libertarian
Party Candidates of North Car-
olina was extremely regrettable.
Attendance of this important
event, though very good, was
hurt by The Davidsonian’s in-
excusable neglect.

Presentations were given at
the Forum by Rick Pasatto,
candidate for the Senate, and
Bob Emory, candidate for go-
vernor of N.C. Both will soon be
on the ballot in this area. For
this reason, if no ather, their
views should be of interest to
Davidson students. Pasatto
voiced strong opposition to the
draft and spoke about the role
of Libertarianism on the nation-
al scene, the inadequacy of
Carter’s so-called anti- inflation

tionist foreign policy. Emory
addressed more local issues: the
need for a major cut of regula-
tions and taxes on food produc-
tion and distribution in N.C.,

the scandalous excesses of the.

Milk Commission, and the need

for overall reduction of state
programs and taxes.
Libertarians promote indivi-
dual freedom, a free-market
economy, and a non-interven-
tionist, non-militaristic foreign
policy. We are all vehemently
opposed to resumption of re-
gistration and the draft, which
we consider to be a gross form
of involuntary servitude and an
immoral and unconstitutional
violation of individual rights.
Now for the announcement:
Ed Clark, Libertarian Candi-
date for President of the United
States, will visit Davidson on
Friday, April 11 and speak at 10
a.m. in the Chambers Gallery.
Clark — known as ‘‘The Emi-
nently Reasonable Radical‘ —
has a degree from Harvard. He
received nearly 400,000 votes in
the 1978 race for governor of
California. Over the past seven

' years, the Libertarian Party has

experienced a surge in popular
support and national recogni-

tion.
