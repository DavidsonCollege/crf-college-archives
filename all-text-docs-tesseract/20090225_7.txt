Date Auction to Save Endowment

Chambers —In an effort to help
the sagging endowment, Davidson
College President Tom Ross has
organized a faculty date auction.
After the success of similar frater-
nity and eating house events, Ross
felt this was an easy way to raise
money.

“Obviously we have all been
hit by the financial crisis. I prom-
ised not to alter student life or fire
anybody. I think the only reason-
able course of action is a faculty
date auction. If my estimations
are correct the date auction alone
should replace most of the money
lost in the past six months.”

“_.Gilbert Gottfried
and Bob Saget to
MC the event...”

Next Saturday your favorite
professors will be presented in the
Lilly Gallery. Each will display a
special talent and then will be auc-
tioned off to the highest bidder. All
the proceeds will go to the endow-
ment. The professor who garners
the most money will not only help
the college but gain bragging rights
in the faculty lounge for years to
come.

Trent Payne (T. Payne, as he is af-

attempted to show students the im-

“Not only has Auto-
tuning my voice sky rocketed my
career from mediocre to unparal-
leled, but it has helped with my so-
cial life as well.”

Payne has sung about his rela-
tionships with famous female ce-
lebrities like Stripper, Bartender,
and Shawty. When asked what one
piece of advice he would give to
untalented but aspiring singers, Dr.
T. Payne had this to say: “It’s not

Career Services Sees Spike in

Unconventional Job Applications

Davidson—The recent eco-
nomic downturn has
the employment opportunities for
college seniors across the nation.

“ ..Beach Bros and
Town Drunks are
also very popular.”

“Many of our best and brightest are
scrambling to finish resumes and
cover letters or are searching eCa-
reers for any new postings,” said
Career Services Director Bob Car-
roll. Slews of others are requesting
xecommendations and are final-
izing applications to medical and
law schools. But a large number of
students are looking into some un-
traditional options for employment
in the next few years.

The oft overlooked group of
potential stay at home dads has a
seen a rise in applicants this year.
Ski Bums have also a seen a huge
number of applicants from David-
son College, while Beach Bros and
Town Drunks are also very popu-
lar. Professional Philosopher, an
entirely useless job, has also seen
an upsurge of applicants.

“Because of the economic crisis
there really aren’t that many jobs

Slumdog Millionaire Upsets
The Davidson Show in Oscar Win

Los Angeles—The stars were
out and shining bright Sunday
night as the 81st Annual Acad-
emy Awards got underway. The
real sparks flew, however, when
dark horse “Slumdog Millionaire”
snatched the “Best Motion Picture
of 2009” award from greedy claws
of the “The Davidson Show.”

“T can’t understand it. Even af-
ter our $30,000 grant, we’re still
playing second fiddle to a bunch
of impoverished third-world kids”
Keith Behl ’10 lamented. “Bribery
or personal politics must have in-
fluenced the judges’ decision—our
production is far superior.”

Behl and his associates have
been working non-stop every Sun-

day for the past semester, shooting

and editing what has been hailed as
the “Queen Mary of fart jokes.” In
an anonymous interview, one pro-
fessor stated that “Behl’s mastery
of convincing an audience of nudi-
ty when in fact, the actor is clothed,
reflects cinematic genius of the rar-
est breed.”

The show’s unparalleled suc-
cess has been met with criticism
by a small but vocal minority. On

an internet message board, user
“Wildc4tD3n” ranted that “Behl
and his cronies are a bunch of no-
talent assclowns!” This sentiment

may have prevailed

amongst Academy

members.
Davidson’s sub-

mission included

content from several
different episodes.
Film critics suggest

narrative allowed the

Hamming sneak in for the win.
ituponthe The show was
red carpet nominated for 3
awards besides Best
Picture but came home Oscar-less.
A personal victory for the cast and
crew, however, was the placement
of Director and Producer Keith
Behl onto the “best-dressed” list.
“The publicity will definitely
help” Behl said. “But night now I
just want to get a snack. Besides,
the Outpost currently houses two
of the average student’s greatest
loves: late-night munchies and the
wildly popular Davidson Show.”

recommend that all seniors explore
some of these career options which
don’t have formal standards for ap-
plication,” Carroll said. “A lot of
cities around here are looking for
highly qualified town drunks.”

Senior Jeff Janoski recently
was accepted to a

Ski Bum residency

While the federal government
doesn’t technically recognize many
of these professions as formal em-
ployment, Carroll dismisses these
criticisms. “Those are purely lo-
gistical errors in reporting. Beach
Bros and Ski Bums are vital to our
economy, and the Davidson educa-
