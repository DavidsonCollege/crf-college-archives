THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 27, 1933

Sam Hines Is to Be
Leader of Davidson
Orchestra This Year

Addition of Stringed Instruments

Is One of New Features of
College Orchestra

The Davidson College Orchestra has
been organized for the coming year
under the direction of Sam M. Hines,
who was chosen as leader for 1933-34
by members of last year’s orchestra.

Three members of the old organiza-
tion, known as the Southernaires,
were lost through graduation. They
were Reeves Pope, saxophone; Wood-
row Calligan, guitar and arranger, and
Bob Orr, trombone. Also Frank
Tucker, who has been the bass player
for the past two years, finds it impos-
sible to continue in this capacity.
There remain only five members of
last year’s successful organization and
the vacancies will be hard to fill. How-
ever, at the tryouts in Shearer Hall
on September 18, the following old
men. retained their positions: A. M.
Cunningham, trumpet; J. A. C. Rob-
inson, violin and tenor saxophone; Bill

’ MaclIlwinen, piano; Dave McLain,
drums, and Sam Hines, saxophone. To
this group were added Charlie Uucas,
guitar; Ed Johnson, trombone; Clar-
ence Rozelle, violin; Jim Crooks, bass;

Bill Fraley, saxophone, and Ed Woot-

en, saxophone.

Several changes are to be made in|

instrumentation this year. Clarence
Rozelle and J. A. G Robinson will
form the violin section¥a feature which
will add much to the orchestra, Bari-
tone saxophones will be used exten-
sively, and the bass horn will be re-
placed by a bass violin.

Practices are being held in Shearer
Hall three times a week and it is be-
lieved that the organization will round
into shape quickly and in the coming

Arbuckle Completes
Term as Pi.K.A. Head

Has Been President Fraternity
Twenty-one Years

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, head of the
Chemistry department at» Davidson
College, attended the Pi Kappa Alpha
convention this summer at Troutdale-
in-the-Pines, where he served his
twenty-first year as Grand President
of the fraternity.

Representatives from 77 out of the
79 chapters were present at the meet-
ing, which lasted from August 30 to
September 2. Lynn Huie acted as rep-
resentative of the Davidson Chapter.

Troutdale-in-the-Pines is a beautiful
resort hotel located about 30 miles
from Denver, Colorado, It derives its
name from the fact that rainbow trout
'may be caught in abundance at the

lake near the hotel. The altitude is
nearly seven thousand feet at this
point. All of the representatives lived

either at the hotel or in cabins nearby,
there being no city nearer than Den-
ver.

Dr. Arbuckle’s position is a unique
one in the fraternity world. He has
served as Grand President for twenty-
tion held every two years. The odd
year was caused by the fact that the
last convention was postponed for one
year. Dr. Arbuckle was first elected
while teaching at Agnes Scott. He

Book Review

It is-customary for a professor to
| begin the academic year with a short

{synopsis of the course he is to give, |

|framing his panorama with that dull
joak finish known as “ parallel.” Usually

}the professor is kind enough to limit |

jing season.

On the fiction shelf, we'll probably
see The Innocent Wife by Colette,
Precious Jeopardy by Lloyd C. Doug-

Obsession), a book by the always in-

Scanning the biography and mem-
oirs, we'll see: a volume of Virginia
Woolf's incomparable biography of
Flush, E. B. Browning’s cocker span-
iel, which is now appearing in the
Atlantic; St. Thomas A Quinas by G.
K. Chesterton; It Was the Nightingale,
the autobiography of Ford Madox
Ford; Dolly Gann’s Book, reminis-
cences of Washington life; My Battle
‘by Adolf Hitler, and Reminiscences of
D. H. Lawrence by John Middleton
Murry.

The poetry section is, as usual, qual-
itatively promising if quantitatively
bare. FE. A. Robinson will publish
Talifer, a narrative poem; all of Sara
Teasdale’s unpublished poems will be
published as Strange Victory; a Col-
