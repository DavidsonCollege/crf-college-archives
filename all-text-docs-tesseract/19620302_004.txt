Oldest College Servant|

Dies, Ends Early Era

Davidsonian Feature Writer

Enoch Donaldson died last Sunday morning, and it is said that an era died
with him. He left a long record of faithful service to the college and the genuine

affection of “his white folks.”

Enoch was born sémewhere And so an era did in a sense

VICE-PRESIDENT’

Piecing together fragments,
Dr. Chalmers Davidson figures
he was at least 94, and could
easily have been a centenarian.
Whatever his age, Enoch came
to Davidson sometime in the,
early 1880's, a young married
man.

In those days, students could
hire janitors for about a dollar
a month. In this way, Enoch
began his service to the college.
Then Dr. J. B. Shearer was
president of the school, and
Enoch served him until his death

After Dr. Shearer's death
Bnoch went back to being a
janitor, and retired from his
post in the old physics build:

of his service that the college
continued his salary into re
tirement.

PATERNALISTIC AGE

But it was a strange sort of
retirement. For Enoch Donald
son was one of the last members
of a paternalistic age. To him,
every student was always “‘Mis-
ter” and every yes followed by
a sir. And although he was a
small man, he had a natural
dignity that came largely from
“the folks he belonged to.”

two years ago, his “God Al

familiar sound as he opened the
doors to his “boys grown old.”
It cost you a quarter left in the

a genuine blessing, and Enoch

There never was any ques.

“Dean Rusk is a well chosen

“As Undersecretary of State

fee hour were long and detail-
ed—during the hour, time per-

tions.

PROPOSED CHANGES

The Congressman proposes
various changes in U.S. foreign
policy:

—How should the U.S. gain
initiative in the Cold War? “We
must get the Free World to-
gether. We must prove to new
countries and our allies that we
stand behind our stated poli-
cies.”

—To what extent should we
negotiate? “Negotiations must
cease to be a Russian time-
gaining maneuver. We must
stop being afraid; we're not go-
ing to insult Russia into war.”

—Just how far do we dare
push Russia? “As far as it takes
to insure the end of Red ad-
var.ce. Every time that we have
challenged the Russians, they
have backed down.”

“Russia is like a cancer. There
is some danger if you operate,
but it may be certain death if
you do not.”

Literary Societies
Seek New Interest

The Philanthropic literary so-
ciety is at present planning to
compile its history from old
records now in the college 1i-
brary and desks in Phi Hall.
Dave Breiten, Phi president,
says his group hopes to find a
rconstitution in the disorganized
documents.

The Philanthropic Society wilt
initiate selected Freshmen. next
Monday. Eu initiated 20 fresh-
men recently.

Bob Rea, Eu president, notes
that the societies are for stud-
ents interested in debate,
drama, and literature who don’t
have enough time for the more
intensive participation required
for the debate team or the Vaga-
bonds.

Tom Poston, Eu_vice-presi-
dent, stating that the societies
are often nothing more than a
name to write on a scholarship
form, hopes to revive the in.
terest of the members. “Now

pthe meetings are a burden. I'd

like them to be something the
members would want to come
to." He added that interest ot
meny of the present members
is limited to coming to enough
meetings “to avoid being kick.
ed out.”

Both the Philanthropic and
Eumanean societies will contin.
ue regular meetings, presenting
talks, discussions, debates,
drama skits, and serving coffee
and doughnuts. The annual de-
bate for the literary society cup,
now held by Eumenean, will be

‘staged in late April.

Chairman McRight Directs:

Committee Of Social Club

The steering committee of the new non-Greek social
organization on campus has met several times since its
formation by vote of students interested in the organiza-

tion.

The committee, under the di-
rection of chairman Danny Mc-
Right, has met for the purpose
of drawing up a tentative con-
stitution for the organization.

The committee is composed
of seniors McRight and David
Jordan, juniors Ben Cole and
Rodger Durham, sophomores
Neal Bushoven and Al Mul-
len, and freshmen Pat Fisher,
Rufus Hallmark, and Dick
Vines,

Meeting with Prof. Sam Ma-
loney, the committee has stud-
ied the make-up of organiza-
tions similar to the one propos-
ed for Davidson. So far the com-
mittee has reviewed the consti-
tutions of groups at Trinity
College, the University of the
South, Washington and Jeffer-
son College, and Mercer Uni-
versity. Any document drawn up
will be subject to approval by
students interested in joining
such an organization as well as
by the proper college officials.

The proposed group will be
