Fresh off record-setting season, ’Cats trek to Morehead St.

By Mike ANDERSON
Sports Editor

On November 14, 1998, the Wildcat football
team made history as the winningest installment in
the program’s 101 years, posting a remarkable
record-of 8-2.

Davidson football broke onto the I-AA NS (non-
scholarship) scene last year with a bang, finishing
fifth in the nation in their first season since upgrad-
ing from Division III. The successes of '98, how-
ever, have created a new set of challenges for ‘99.

This Thursday night, after 292 days of wait-
ing, the ‘Cats will take the field again—looking to
answer the biggest question they face this fall:
Was last year’s 8-2 season a fluke? Or was it
merely the most notable (not to mention, glorious)
sign of a-vastly improving program?

In his sermon at DCPC on Sunday, President
Vagt urged the congregation to constantly strive
toward the future, because life can be remarkably
downhill if “the crowning jewel of your life is
something that you have done in the past.” Surely
a poignant message to the Wildcat football squad
as they embark on the °99 season.

Head Coach Tim Landis’s squad travels to.

Morehead, Kentucky, for their season opener this
week against one of the toughest opponents in
recent Wildcat history. Morehead State (who once
fielded retired NFL great, Phil Simms) finished
1998 with a program-best 9-2 record, garnering a
first-place rating in the Football Gazette poll of
Division I-AA NS schools.

“It’s atall order,” “(Morehead
State is) very talented. They’ ve got more size than
us, they’re a bit faster, and they’re deep. They've
just come down from a fully-funded status, which
means they’re still competing with some scholar-
ship athletes.”

It was once said there are no great people in
this world, only great challenges that ordinary
people rise to meet. Landis and his ‘Cats hope to
add this rigorous schedule of opponents to the list
of great challenges his program has risen to meet
this:decade. .

“We want to build on last year’s season.
We're on aroll,” says Landis. “That’s a lot to be
excited about.”

“Last season raises your expectations,” agrees
Tripp Merritt, the ‘Cats’ Associate Head Coach

Landis admits.

and defensive coordinator. “(But) the guys are
pumped, they’re ready to go.”
It’s all about the “D.”

A key for the ‘Cats this season, as it has been
in the past, will be their defensive performance.
The ’98 season was spearheaded by a nationally-
renowned defensive squad that allowed but 10.4
points per game (Davidson’s best points-against
average in 44 years), earning them the nation’s
fourth-best defense

The '99 defense will be built around the
cornerstone of nose guard Bo Henderson. The
6’0” 220-lb. junior from Garinger High in Char-
lotte led the ‘Cats last season with 94 tackles and
7 sacks. Coach Merritt praises, “(Henderson)
made pre-season All- American, and he is at the
peak of his game. He’s even faster and stronger
than he was last year.”

While Henderson rallies the defensive front,
look for Donnie Johnson to key the secondary.
Johnson, who will start at the left corner position,
racked up five interceptions last season, contribut-
ing to the nation’s best pass defense among I-AA
NS schools.

This defense will be tested early, as Morehead
State features perhaps the most multi-talented
offensive scheme the ‘Cats will face this year.
“You name it, they run it,” said Coach Merritt.
“They have a very effective option game, and they
do so many things that they really keep you hoi-
est.”

Eagle quarterback David Dinkins re-wrote
the school’s record books last season, surpassing
the marks for: total offense in a game (482 yards),
total offense in-a season (2,981 yards), best rush-
ing average in a season (8.0 yards per carry),
longest run from scrimmage (89 yards), most
points in a season (122), and most touchdowns in
a season (20).

Hitting Their Stride

On the opposite side of the ball, Davidson
enters its-second season under a newly-installed
“This is our second year in the
spread-option offense,” says Landis. “We made
headway with it last year, but it’s complex and
we've just scratched the surface. With seven of-

fensive starters back, we should continue to
progress.” ;

A key to that progress will be senior fullback
Eric Ferguson. Ferguson, considered among the

best in I-AA football, ranks second in Davidson
history for career yards with 1,818. Another major
piece of the puzzle will be the play of junior
quarterback Shaun Tyrance, who spent much of
last-season sidelined with a torn ACL.
Could there be more?

tend their winning streak to eight games, tying a
record that dates back to World War I.

And a winning season in °99 would make
‘98-'99 the first consecutive winning seasons since
the 1950s. The opportunity to achieve that feat has
Landis and the football program aglow. ‘We

you’ ve got to go back to 1924-26 to find a better
three-year record than we’ve had over the past
three years,” says the seventh-year head coach.

“I’m more enthusiastic about this job than
I’ve ever been.”
