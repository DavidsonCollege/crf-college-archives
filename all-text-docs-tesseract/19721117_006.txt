Campus Living Standards Vary Greatly

By BRUCE CORSER

With new living situations in
the planning stages, students
have some definite ideas on
current methods of student
housing on campus.

Andy Langford, a resident in

Belk, seems to think that the

‘ primary problem in Belk is a

definite lack of personal contact
among students.

“You don't even know the
people in your own hall,’ he
observed. ‘‘They feel like
they've already made all their
friends. This is really sad.”

A STUDY IN PERSPECTIVE
Richardsondormitory shows little imagination

Off-Campus Houses

Provide Alternative

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

An alternative to the
distresses of dormitory living is
off-campus housing. and next
year, more students than ever

will be allowed. even
encouraged, to make living
arrangements — in the
community.

Dean of Students Will Terry
explained that. due to the

necessity of providing more
dormitory space for coeds, the
college is hoping that about 150

students will live off-campus
next vear.
“This is not a change of

policy,’ Terry said, ‘‘just a
matter of necessity. We would
prefer that everyone live on
campus, but we simply cannot
house all of the students.”’

Terry said that the college is
presently asking people in
private homes to take in
students.

“This may not suit
everybody, and we may need
student help in giving up
perhaps more convenient living
arrangements.” he said. I hope
we can find enough students to
go off-campus. The students
wanted coeducation, and some
may have to make sacrifices.”

Terry said that he was
resisting the idea of housing
three students in a dorm room.
‘*We'll do all we can to keep our
present housing from gettin any
more crowded than it is now,”
he said. .

Senior Mike Stovall sees both

advantages and disadvantages
to living off-campus. ‘‘When

you're on campus, you're closer
to what's happening and you're
more aware of activities and
your fellow students,” he said.
‘In a way, off campus you're
isolated, but it has its
advantages.”

Stovall said that he will save
money by living off-campus in
two ways: his rent will be less.
and by cooking his meals in his
kitchen. he will = save
significantly on food costs. He
also mentioned the increased
privacy and study advantages
of not living ina dorm.

Junior Al Barefoot said that
he had moved off-campus
primarily because ‘the idea of
living in a dorm is_ not
particularly appealing to me.’

“The idea of the college
sticking you in a cubbyhole and
saying that that’s where you
live, bothered me.” he said. ‘I
dislike all of the noise and living
with a lot of other people in a
dorm.”

Barefoot agreed that there
was a sense of isolation for
those who live off-campus, but
said that he considered this
neither an advantage nor
disadvantage.

“It's very quiet--I enjoy that,
as well as the privacy. | think
that the advantages outweigh
the partial disadvantages."* he
said.

One of the problems. Barefoot
said, was that when one lives in
a home, he can't invite in a
crowd of people for a party, but
that this didn't create a
difficulty for him personally.

“It's sort of like you have

your own place,” Barefoot said.

The physical layout itself of
Belk contributes much to this
isolation within the dorm. The
halls are long, narrow and
dimly lit, affording little
opportunity for any feeling of
unity.

This makes splitting up the
hall for something like a keg
party impossible. Langford
said, “At no point have the
people in the hall ever gotten
together.”

One proposed remedy for this
would be to have small lounges
at certain spots around the
dorm.

“The lobby is too open and
somewhat deteriorated. They
could knock out a wall and
make quiet. more intimate
sitting rooms with couches
where students could study or
take a date,’’ Langford
suggested.

He also noted that the rooms
in Belk are smaller than any
others on campus. As a result
the two students per room are
rather crowded.

In addition, desks are too
small for adequate storage or
studying, and cumbersome
closets take up much space.

An alternative to dorms such
as Belk is the experiment in
Grey House. This white building
across the street from the
President's home comfortably
houses 14 :pperclassmen.

The house is completely
carpeted and the rooms for two
students are spacious and
receptive to imaginative
decorating.

Jim Edwards, a_ resident
there, commented that living in
Grey House was ‘‘an
alternative to Patterson Court.
In a group this small you know
each other really well.

‘In the freshman year the
hall is the best place to meet
people. Students in Belk have
already made friends and don’t
have much in common except
bitching about the place they
live,’ Edwards commented.

Walter Kreuger, another
resident of Grey House, said
that he liked the house because
it offered ‘‘the privacy of a
small group and a quiet, good
place to study.”

The close-knit group of
upperclassmen that resides
there also uses the house as a
common meeting place to

throw parties or _ hold
discussions.
Several coeds on campus

have voiced their complaints
about certain aspects of their
rooms on the third and fourth
floors of Little Dormitory.

Winnie Hollis related that
certain aspects of her room
were sometimes troublesome.

Closets weren't long enough
for a full-length dress. the
mirror was too high and there
should be more than one mirror
per room, bookshelves were too
high,

“Everything seems to be
made for people six feet tall,"
she noted.

Hollis was very pleased with
the installation of washers and
driers in the coeci halls, and felt
that a carpet would be nice.

She also liked the lounges at
the end of each hall and the idea
of a half male, half female
dorm.

Doug Bragg, a resident in the
lower half of Little Dorm,
agreed with her. ‘I really like
it. I see no point in separating
dorms,"’ he said.

Another coed, Mary Hobbie,
was also in favor of the half-
and-half dorm, but added,
“Some coeds probably had to
make adjustments with all the
boys around."

Her major complaint was
again about the minor technical
faults in her room. She added,
“I'm positive about what the
administration has done, and
they are receptive to our
suggestions.

“As far as I'm concerned,
his group was attempting to do
about making the dorms a little

more liveable.

He commented that the
janitorial service isn't what it
should be. ‘‘The janitors don't
do what they're supposed to do.
They know it and the students
know it,’ Cunningham said.

As a result, boxes have been
placed in the various dorms for
janitorial suggestions.

The RHC is also in the process
of publishing a private phone
directory for the campus. And
since Southern Bell has
removed many pay _ phones
from the dorms, the RHC is
going to pass out a
questionnaire to determine if
the students would like more
pay phones.

Other items in the planning
stages are a damage control
board and the possible purchase
of another ice machine.

This year the Dorm Social
Council was set up to encourage
dorm parties and other social
functions and to help students
get to know the other people
they live with.

Commenting about other
improvements that could be
made, Cunningham said that
there were spots in each dorm
where small kitchenettes could
be set up.

Cunningham said that in the
near future ‘‘something will
have to be done about the floors
in Belk. They've been torn up
pretty badly with everyday
wear and tear.

‘As for study rooms in Belk,
the school loses revenue on the
space which isn't used to house
students.’’ Cunningham was
therefore somewhat pessimistic
about such rooms being built.
they did a good job in preparing
for us, but they weren't as
ready for us as they thought
they were."’

Being aware of some of the
problems in the _ residential
housing, Bob Cunningham,
president of the Residence Hall
Council (RHC), related what
