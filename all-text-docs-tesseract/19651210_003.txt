THE DAVIDSONIAN

MILITARY, ACADEMIC MEN GIVE VIEWS

Viet Nam Situation Evaluated’

By BILL SEIGLER
Davidsonten ‘Steff Writer

The Viet Nam seminar
sponsored Monday night by
the Eumenean Literary So-
ciety presented an informa-
tive history of the United.
States involvement in Viet
Nam and_,raised controver-
sial questions as to why ‘the
U. S. is there.

About 60 persons crowded into
Eu Hall to hear the two and
one half hour discussion. Repre-
senting the Military Science De-
partment in the presentation
were Col. Frederick Outlaw,
Capt. Robert Crittenden and
Capt. Joe Crawlez, while Dr.
Paul Marrotte. Dr. Philip Se-
cor and Dr. Ernest Patterson
were the other faculty partici-
pants.

“Why are we there? We don’t
know." Outlaw was referring to
our situation in Viet Nam when
he said those words, but per-
haps they could refer to the
meeting as well since no central
theme of the discussion was ap-
parent.

In his opening remark Outlaw
said that the program ‘was not
a debate on policy,’ but it
later turned into just that.

Western involvement in South-
east Asia, according to Critten-

den, began when the French
moved into Saigon in 1861 and
took over Indochina and the con-
trol of the rubber industry.

RISE OF HO

Dissension caused by the
wealth of the French contrasted
to the squalor of the Vietnamese
prompted Ho Chi Minh to incite
a revolt in the 1930's against the
French.

Interrupted by World War IT,
the revolt continued when the
French regained control of Indo-
china from the Japanese. In this
revolt the U. S. under Eisen-
hower, tacked the French fi-
nancially.

In 1954 the revolut.on culmi-
nated with the split of Viet Nam.
Ho received the land north of
the 17th parallel, while Diem
won an election in the South,
but was immediately beset with
problems.

The Viet Cong successfully be-

gan attacks, finally resulting in|.

Diem‘s overthrow in 1963, the
first of about 10 coups in the
South Vietnamese gevornment.
“Every time we were told to
move north,” Crittenden related
from his Viet Nam experience,
"I sensed another coup.”

According to Dr. Marrotte, the
problems in South Viet Nam de-
veloped from ‘‘a power vacuum
in Southeast Asia since World
War II.’ Our pdlicy, the con-
sistency of which Marrotte feels
may depict the consent of the
people, has had two main ob-
jectives: to counter ‘‘local sub.
versive movements” and to stop
“the advance of Communist
China into this strategic area.”

Marrotte then discussed Com-
munist efforts in Viet Nam. The
Communists have been most suc-

means, but have done poorly in
personal diplomacy. By avoiding
a direct act of war, Marrotte
pointed out,> the Communists
have avoided any counteraction
by the United States.

COMMUNIST MOTIVES

“I don't think that there is
any question that the Commu-
nists want to dominate South-
east Asia.” Marrotte continued.
He listed five reasons why the
Communists desire this area:
for food, that country being the
“rice bowl of Asia: for tin,
rubber and petroleum; because
of its population; to end U. S,
influence in the area and to
Jessen the effectiveness of the
U. S. perimeter defense in the
area,

An examination of the U. S.
involvement in Viet’ Nam
brought Marrotte to several con-
clusions. For example, he said
that the attack on Pearl Harbor
was probably caused by our not
letting the Japanese have a free
hand in Southeast Asia.

KOREAN PARALLELS

OR COU

Outlaw concluded that if
South Niet Nam falls, the United
States must be prepared to give
up Laos, Cambodia and per-
’haps Siam and the rest of South-
east Asia.

SECOR DOGMAS

Recognizing that he was pre-
paring to ‘‘raise a few questions
in terms of dogmatic affirma-
tions,” Secor agreed that the
real enemy to the United States
is Chinese imperialism, but.
questioned: the U. S. policy to-
ward stopping it,

Secor also recognized the frus-
trations of Ho, but attributed
their cause to the Chinese and
Soviets rather than to the U. S.

Secor raised a question con-
cerning the so-called ‘‘domino”
theory, that as soon as one
Southeast Asian country falls.
others will fall in progression
after it. “Us Kennedy worship
pers... say... the theory of

. the domino in the Pentagon

doesn't hold up under critical ex-
amination.”

MORAL INDIGNATION

Secor also discussed the rise
of moral indignation in the U. S.
concerning the war, saying that
citizens now actually see the ef-
fects of war and are appalled by
them. He perceived a great in-
fluence in the passive resistance
movement, which he termed
**very practical and political and
realistic. and forceful."’

Secor concluded that he didn’t
think the U. S. could withdraw
from Viet Nam, buat that ‘the
trick'is to work out a way of
staying in Viet Nam, in my opin-
ion, and accepting defeat there.
We can’t haye Barry there, and
we can't withdraw.”

PATTERSON FACTS

The first point made by Pat-
terson was that: there seemed
to be at least two sets of facts
circulating. ‘‘I just don't have
the same facts,’ he lamented.

Patterson read a quote defend.
ing the publishing of pictures
of war atrocities. After again
pointing out that contradictory

information was being given the
people, Patterson supported Se-
cor's statement of the untenabil-
ity of the domino theory.

Using witticisms concerning
the different names given to
“Vv, C.’s,”’ Patterson concluded
that it did not seem that the life
of either the V. C. whatever
name given him). or the Vietna-
mese mattered.

Patterson agreed with Secor
and Marrotte in that the U. S.
is in Viet Nam to stop Chinese
imperialism, but denounced the
anti-Communist movement in
the United States. He brought
out the importance of distin-
guishing between nationalistic
aims and those of Communists.

Patterson said that he had dis-
covered this anti-Communist
movement while at the same col-
lege which President Johnson
attended, adding ‘See what he
didn’t learn while he was
there?”’

Self-Study On Financial Policy
Urges Study Of Athletic Grants

By TOM CRAIG
Davidsonian Associate Editor
(An Analysis)

In its investigation of the col-
lege's finances, the Self-Study
Committee on Financial Re-
sources, Policies and Proced-
ures was generally compliment-
ary of this area of Davidson life.

Numerous charts and graphs
were included in the report,
with data indicating the growth
and projected growth of the col-
lege’s endowment from 1955 to
1974 and also indicating im-
provement in school salary.

Two recommendatiofis regard.
ing the ‘‘mechanics’’ of the fi-
nances area were made. The
first suggests that an annual
college financial report be made
and distributed to the faciilty,

The second suggests that once
every four years the President
of the college request the Budget
Committee to survey current
trends of the various budget ac-
tivities and to recommend any
budgetary adjustments and
changes desirable a‘ that time.

A third recommendation sug-
gested the appointment of a
temporary Summer School Eval-
uation Committee by the Presi.
dent of the college to study and
recommend ways of improving
the whole program of summer
education at Davidson.

One .area of the college. was
particularly subject. to the con-
cern of the Committee. It rec-
ommended that “immediate and
far reaching changes be initiat
ed to improve the working con:
ditions and pay of non salaried
employees."

In the Committee report, it
was pointed out that. of this
group of college employees (in-
cluding maintenance, janitorial,
laundry and kitchen personnel),
35 per cent of them, or 54 out of
99, made less than $2,400 for the
year 1963-64. Eighty per cent,
or 79 out of 99, made less than
$2,860 for that year.

This same group must ‘work
45 hours per week has very lim-
ited vacation time and is not
covered under the college dis-
ability insurance plan.

A lengthy recommendation,
including the Committee's sug-
gestions of broad guide lines
for the modification and im
provement of the Life Insurance
Program, was also included at

Report Criticizes Council

(A Davidsonlan Analysis)

Davidson's Student Council is
only partially effective, caus-
ing campus leaders to adopt an
attitude of apathy towards this
branch of student government,
asserted the Self-Study’s Student
Personnel Committee.

The Honor Court, on the other
hand, is strongly effective and
holds real power which is based
essentially upon student accept-
anceof the Honor System, the
committee pointed out.

Student Council members be-
slieve their proposals ate often
ignored by the faculty and ad-
ministration and that their leg-
{slative power is circumscribed
by the college officials, it was
felt.

Despite this analysis of the
student government at David-
son, the committee offered no
recommendations to deal with
improving this facet: of college

life.

The study group pointed out
instead that students exert ‘‘con-
siderable influence’ on the for-
mulation of college policy and
that their opinions are reflected
in the content of the Student
Body Constitution.

FRATERNITIES BYPASSED

Of the 24 specific recommen-
dations presented by the com-
mittee, none dealt with the fra-
ternity question, which the re-
port merely explained “has be-
come (at long last) an area of
vital concern to the college as
a whole.”

The fraternity problem is ‘far
from settled," the group point-
ed out. “Strong efforts.’ it
stressed, ‘“‘are being made to
reduce hazing, as well as the
unnecessary waste of time in
other stupid and juvenile activi-
ties’ which occur during Greek

Week.

It is noteworthy that the com-
mittee did not suggest the ‘‘elim-
ination’’ of such activities, only
that “efforts are being made to
reduce” them.

In other aspects, the commit-
tee recommended the addition of
at least two clinical psycholog-
ists who would give one-half
time each to the counseling of
emotionally disturbed students.
Two half-time men would be
more effective than the full time
of one clinical psychologist, the
committee believed.

A dining room hostess should
be secured to supervise the Col-|
lege Union food service and ‘‘to
add an air of pleasant hospital-
ity during meal time,” the group
advised.

An overall mechanization in
thé system of student records
and registration was strongly
urged by the study group. The

possibility of remunerating the
faculty advisers was also men-
tioned. by the professors in this
report.
ADMISSIONS CHANGES
On the admission of students,
the group recommended that
each applicant be interviewed
before he is accepted. Stagger-
ed four-year appointments to
the Faculty Admissions Commit-
tee by the administration were
also in the recommendations.
The establishment of a ma-
jor academic scholarship,

awarded irrespective of finan-
cial need, was also recommend-
ed. The awards would be simi-
lar to the Morehead scholar-
ships at the University of North
Carolina.

The committee minority was
recorded as favoring the con-
tinuation of the present policy

the end of the Committee's re-
port.

The Committee recommended
that the “whole matter of ath-
letic grants he studied, with
particular attention to the rela-
tionship of this expenditure’ to
the receipts from the Living
Endowment .. .”

The Committee noted that a
much higher percentage of the

annual Living Endowment Fund
is being used now for athletic
grants than was intended when
the Fund was established in
1955.

About 48 per cent of the Liv-
ing Endowment in 1964-65 was
used for athletic scholarships, as
opposed to the 34 per cent figure
originally intended in the 1955
Living Endowment “charter.”

The disparity has occurred as
the formula for obtaining the
number of grants to be issued
has not been adjusted to the
rising costs of a year at David-
son. The Committee presents
statistics that use projected
figures s0 indicate a possible
81 per cent of the Living Endow-
ment being used for athletic
scholarships in 1973-74.

months, Grover C. Meetze, di-
rector of the physical plant, an-
nounced last week.

“We have some tentative|
sketches now, but for the most
part our work is still in the
early planning stages,” he com-
mented.

Present plans call for new |
chairs and seating arrangement,
enlargement of the stage, air
conditioning and addition of
dressing rooms behind the stage.

“But even with all of this
decided,’ Meetze noted, ‘‘there
is yet much planning to be
done. As of now, we have only
suggested what the new seats
will look like: and how they will
be arranged.

“As far as the stage is con-
cerned, we plan to enlarge it, re- :)
move the pillars and add new
steps. We have some crude
drawings done, but nothing defi-
nite has been settled,” he added.

Meetze went on to say that the'
windows will be bricked close to
accommodate the air condition-
ing but that no definite arrange-
ment for the cooling system has
been decided.

‘We feel these. renovations.
will greatly influence Chambers.
The larger stage will make it
possible fo accommodate large
performing groups more easily.
And, of course, no one will argue
with the air conditioning,”’
Meotze noted.

From the financial standpoint.
the outlook is even less certain.
