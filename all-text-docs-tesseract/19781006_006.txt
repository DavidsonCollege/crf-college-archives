Conservati

~ By JEAN-SORACCO

Conservation is a concern of
the Davidson College campus
this year. Glass and paper recy-
cling efforts are two of the
_strongest 1 movements.

Glass recycling, previously
done by the FIJI’s, has been
organized this year by both KA
and Rusk houses. Dr. Locke
White brought up the subject at
the Conservation on Campus
meeting, and members of both
houses volunteered to under-

take the service project...

Boxes for recyclable glass
have been placed on the halls,
and there are bing by the
dempsy dumpsters. The main
bins are located behind the
stores and the PO on Main
Street.

Every four or six weeks the
members of KA and Rusk will
sort our the glass, crush it and
place it in 55 gallon drums
supplied by the town. When
there are enovgh drums to fill a

reas ae

’

truck, the crushed glass will be be

taken near Win ton-Salem_and
sold. -.. ee

The town of Davidson is very
enthusiastic about the recycling
effort because 'it/is economical.
The students voluntarily do the
work, and the town receives the
money.

“The exciting part of the re-
cycling efforts,” says Anthony
Sanfilippo, one of the KA
members involved in the orga-
nization of the project, “‘is the
development of concern for the

earth on the Davidson cam-

Lad

pus.

Paper recycling efforts in-
volve several groups -- the Bio-
logy Society, SGA, the Student
Y Program, APQ = and
NC PIRG.

There are boxes located on
each hall in which students
should place any type of paper
except for glossy such as photos
or magazines. The money raised
will be used to restore the shed
behind Little where the paper is

Mike McGrady, one of the
organizers of paper recycling,
feels that the drive is going very
well. “The boxes have been out
on the halls for 2 weeks, and I
have made three trips to the

about 400 pounds of paper each

time.

An additional recycling effort
is occuring at Slater. To help
save paper Ron Scott has asked
the freshmen to carry re-usable
cups with them to all meals.
Aiding in 'this effort, the SAE

ses. These glasses will be for

In a quest for ‘‘qood quality,
unusual, natural food,’’ a small
group of Davidson residents
have banded together to form a
natural foods cooperative. The
infant organization, led by
Suzie Yoder, Ruth Pittard,
Anne Retzer and Siri Holland,
is associated: with the large
Charlotte cooperative Common
Harvest. ,

To begin the experiment, the
group is attempting to market
cheese With little or no preser-
vatives in Davidson. Using
Common Harvest as a sort of
middieman the group hopes to
obtain the cheese from Appala-
tic Federation of Food Coopera-
tives. Hopefully this initial ven-
ture can be expanded into a

mental issues such as the
anti-nuclear protests, political
affairs and educational con-
cerns.

The Davidson Co-op will be
much more modest than its
“parent” group. The member-
ship will consist of those who
have paid the $3.00 for the
operating period. The money
will be used to buy the supplies
that the co-op will need to func-
tion.

There are three types of
members with which the Dayid:
son group will work. The most
active level is that of ‘‘working

expected to contribute about
ten hours per order. The other
levels are ‘‘supportive mem-
bers” (five hours per order) and

multi-faceted food co-op. If it is
successful, the group hopes to
open a store front in Davidson.
The Davidson organization is
modelled on the massive Com-
mon Harvest co-op. The latter
is divided into blocs with each
having some responsibility. The
1600 members of Common Har-
vest are not only concerned with
the procurement of natural

The money not spent on

The main purpose of recy-
cling, according to Mike Mc-
Grady, is to begin to make
people care about how much
waste goes on around them.”
Davidson College is obviously
beginning to care.

~The problem of resources and

the initial lack of interest by the
eating houses points up the lack
of student involvement. The
cheese venture will never be
launched unless there is some
support ‘by the student body.
To gain strength it is possible
that all the co-ops on campus,
such as the bike co-op, would be
united under the same roof.
Hopefully such a banding toge-
ther of resources.and funding
would let the cheese venture
take off and become a full
fledged co-op.

The organizing members em-
phasize the fact that this fledg-
ling organization is just getting
on its feet and that it needs sup-
port badly.. The membership
form indicates that even if one
is not planning to buy any

“non-working” members. —
The co-op members will be or-
ganized into blocs that deal
with bookkeeping, communica-
tions, operations and expan-
sion/legal services. This small
make-up is in contrast to Com-
mon Harvest’s eighteen blocs.
At this time there are fifteen
members with more expected.

in future activities and expan-
sion would be welcome.

Anyone hoping to join should
send a check for three dollars to
Siri Holland at Box 2173
(make the checks payable to
her.). Anyone with questions
about the cheese operation is
directed towards its manager
Suzie Yoder. Forms and

pation. At the moment there
has been little response from
any of the houses, except ATO,
on this subject. Initial contacts
with ARA Slater have indicated
that the dining service would
require weekly purchases

four to eight purchases all year)

this new group.

at the Union, Village Store,
Perregrine House, or from one
of the group’s leaders.

With enough support this
initial operation will be expan-

_ ded into a beneficial experience

for all. The members emphasize
the quality and purpose of this
attempt. As Ruth Pittard, one
of the organizers, said, ‘It’s not
cheaper, it’s better.”’
