\ \ hat do you say toa

man who has given almost his
entire life to your college? We decided to

let him do the talking, a role with which he
felt plenty comfortable.

April 12, 1994

What was Davidson like when
you were chaplain, and whatchanged
for you when you became the Dean?

Well, the nature of the jobs are so
very different. If you mean, what was
Davidson like when I came back, it
was a thousand men, chapel was still
three days a week, vespers was obliga-
tory. It was a very tight community.
Basketball was making its way into
national prominence, and that was.
probably the most fun thing about that
era. It was really a mania, and it was
very good in helping build commu-
nity. :
Alcohol was not on campus, so
most of the social life took place off
campus. The three big weekends were
bigger because there were no women
here and the weekends were a lot of
the social life. Men moved out of the
dorms when women came in, not like
today. (We’ll just leave it at that.)

But it was a fun time. At that
point, I could know the names of
practically every student on campus,
and did, and formed a very close pas-
toral relationship with lots of stu-
dents. Students didn’t have as many
problems then as they do now. The
family was more stable, we had not
experienced the turmoil of the Viet-
nam War or the upheavals of the Civil
Rights movement that upset the equi-
librium of society. It was also when
we had our first African student here,
which was the beginning of integra-
tion. Then we began admitting Afri-
can-Americans. -

_ What was the most tumultuous
time you remember at Davidson?
The time when! was atthe church
was when all the up-
heaval began that

Students were really very con-
cerned about their futures, though,
even if they had a future. “I could go
to Vietnam and be shot and never

come back, so what’s the purpose ofit ©

all?” Of course, a lot of people were
in school to keep from going to Viet-
nam. It wasa difficult time for every-
body. In the midst of all that, too, was
the introduction of self-selection and
the turmoil that brought on Patterson
Court with fraternities leaving and
leaving very angry. Two moved off
campus, and then a lot of them left for
good. And then in ‘73 was the advent
of coeducation, which certainly was
the most significant change that has
taken place at Davidson, at least in the
forty years I’ve knownanything about
it. » :

And I guess as far as personal
turmoil the two most tumultuous times
were the great disaffection by the foot-
ball players when we went to division
Ill. They did not feel treated right by
the college and their parents were
very angry. I was the sounding board
for their anger because they saw meas
an ally. Out of that came some very
fine friendships, however. The other

one was two years ago during all the
turmoil involving SAE and the Select
Committee and all that stuff. That
was the most personally painful time
for me ever. :

and higher education
and, in some ways,
Davidson.

That was forthe

sarily my involve-

your opinion, have
helped Davidson the
most in becoming a
nationally recognized
liberal arts college?

fish nor fowl, Fwas sort of an outsider,
and the students who came to the
house just came because they wanted
to. But I noticed sort of a general
hostility toward adults in general when
I first came back to-the college.
That was the theme of the age—
we don’t trust anybody over thirty.
That was a surprise to me. It showed

it was an indigenous part of the atti-,

tude because I hadn’t been in here
long enough to make anybody un-
happy, but they walked down the hall
and sort of stared through you. That
didn’t last very long.

own influence in edu-
cational circles when
he came to Davidson
which were strength-
ened as he was at Davidson. He
implemented programs and policies
like coeducation, emphasis on an in-
ternational experience, and a shift in
faculty recruitment.

We put more emphasis on re-
search than previously. | think Ad-
missions began to make us more geo-
graphically diverse, which raised
people’s awareness in higher educa-
tion circles of our place. Part of it may
be that people just began to recognize
the excellence that was here all along.

I don’t know what else to say _

about it. We became recognized for

the excellent institution we’ve always
been, and we did some things to
heighten our profile. Basketball had
something to do with it, early on,
because people began to know there
was a little college inthe South named

. Davidson through basketball. Per-

haps people began to look harder and
saw we were good.. Another thing I
think may have helped was that the
South has become more enticing as a
place to come to school. That’s cer-

tainly been Davidson’s experience, .

but'that’s also been the experience of
schools like Duke, Chapel Hill, UVA,
and Wake Forest. People began to
look at Davidson as a place that they
might like to go to school, and found
that that’s what they want in acollege.

My concern about our rise is that
I think that in order to keep that posi-
tion, we are too likely to sacrifice

some of the things that have made us.

great.

We have always had the ten-
dency to look over there and say,
“Let’s be like them,” rather than,
“Let’s be us,” and I think Dr. Kuyken-
dall was very wise when he came here
and said that he thought that what

ell, my favorite thing about
Davidson is the students.

Davidson needed to do was decide
what Davidson wanted to be, and if
we did it well, we would be. acclaimed
for our.excellence. National ranking
was something that came to you be-
cause you were doing things right, not
something you did in order to get
national recognition. | think that is a
very wise posture.

Doyou have any advice for your
successor?

The one thing | think a Dean of
Students should always be is an advo-
cate for students, primarily. Not an
advocate for the faculty, the adminis-
tration, or even the Trustees. Now
that doesn’t mean that one has to
acquiesce to every student wish, be-
cause that would be foolishness, but
one needs to be seen as the Dean of
Students, not as the mouthpiece of
somebody else. That’s the one thing
I would say that’s important. I cer-
tainly hope that person will look at
some of the mistakes I’ve made and
not make the same ones. And the new
Dean will find that all too clearly.
Everybody will be glad to tell the
person what they want immediately.
That person can look at those mis-
takes and see how to rectify them and
therefore have a very successful ten-
ure.

Whatare your favorite andleast
favorite things about Davidson?

Well, my favorite thing about
Davidson is the students. I won’t say

what my least favorite thing is for the
record, It’s the students, it’s the sense
of history that we really have been a
part of something that was very spe-
cial and very different. In our time, a
sense of history. is scomed by a lot of
people at Davidson. That’s unfortu-
nate, but that’s the way it is. I think
the thing I like is the pride students
take in their friendships with each
other and the kind of support that

brings, and the genuine care that a lot
of them have for one another. And
that’s not universal, and that’s unfor-
tunate, butit’s not universal anywhere.
That's the thing I like most about
Davidson.

What do you see in Davidson’s
Suture?

In the short run I see Davidson
really having to financially tighten its
belt and make some very tough finan-
cial decisions. And as the Dean that
concerns me because if some other
institutions are‘any measure and even
some of my experience here is that the
first thing some people want to cut is
student services. That is a dangerous
temptation.

I see that financial belt-tighten-
ing as not all bad because it may make
us more efficient about the way we do
a lot of other things. The primary
objective, as far as I’m concerned, of
a college is not to be just efficient but
to serve the needs of its students and
its faculty and to keep the promises it
makes to its students and to the stu-
dents’ parents when they come here. I
think that’s going to be a real issue in
the next few years and one that needs
to be taken seriously.

I think we’ve been so very lucky .

in being able to attract good students.

That is a never-ending and capricious
undertaking because you never know
what the hot college is going to be the
next year. I think we have got in
Nancy Cable Wells an absolutely first-
rate person who understands what
needs to be done and who | feel has
embraced Davidson and what it really
means in a way that few new admin-
istrators do. I think that as long as we
keep her, which is not going to be
easy, the admissions picture is going
to be pretty bright. Admissions is our -
life-blood. 1 hope Davidson will not

- become just a rich person’s college.

With the financial problems ahead,
that’s going to be atemptation. I hope
Davidson will always maintain a
democratic spirit that I’ve experienced
in the past that a person is judged by
who-he or she is and not by what
mama does or what papa owns. That’s
a very important thing that many of
our peer institutions don’t have. But
I think we do have it, and I hope we’ll
maintain it.

I hope we will keep athletics as a
very vital and viable part of the col-
lege, because I think it’s given us a
name recognition that nothing else
does. It’s given us an alumni support
that few other things do. Besides, it’s
fun and contributes to a well-rounded
student body.

I think we are a very well-man-
aged college, and I think that will
continue. The selection of the next
president will be very crucial to the
future of the college, and I have abso-
lutely no predictions on that. The four *
presidents I’ve worked for have been
a remarkable group of people who
have been very talented and whose
weaknesses were always compensated
by their successor’s strengths so that ©
they have been able to build on each
other’s legacy. And I hope that will
be true in the future, and if it is, I think
we’ll be in good shape.

Do you have any parting words
for the campus?

Well, to be trite but to be very
sincere, thanks for the memories.
