Plagued by delays, ’93-’94 O

By Carrie Blackburn

The end of August marks the
beginning of another school year,
but disgruntled students still await
the arrival of the ‘93-‘94 Quips
and Cranks. Although originally
scheduled to be distributed some-
time this month, deadline delays
have pushed the’ arrival date to
October 15th.

Last year a small staff ham-
pered ’93-’94 Editor-in-Chief An-
gela Capillary. Even though Cap-

illary worked into the summer, the
yearbook publishing date was
pushed farther and farther back.
Capillary is now proofing the last
few pages, and the yearbook will
be sent to the printer shortly.
This year marks other changes
for the yearbook staff. A contract
with Walsworth Publishing Com-
pany landed the Quips and Cranks
a Macintosh computer and the pro-
gram Desktop. Previously, the
entire book involved a tedious,

manual process.

tor-in-Chief of the ‘94-95
staff Amy Liz Betz thinks “it will
be acost effective way of publish-
ing/a yearbook because it saves the
company a lot of time since we do
lot of work for them.”

Betz arrived early for the fall
semester to learn the new soft-
are. She hopes using Desktop
will be an incentive to build a strong
staff because the skills they learn
are the ones most magazines and

Dr. Ruth,
AIDS quilt
to visit
campus

By Osric Prioleau

Rumor became fact on Au-
gust 15 when final approval ar-
rived to display the NAMES
Project AIDS Memorial Quilt on
the Davidson campus. The Quilt
will arrive Thursday, November
10 and will be displayed through
Sunday, November 13.

Co-Coordinators Sherry
Malushizky and Nat May spear-
headed efforts to bring the quilt to
Davidson, earning approval from
the NAMES Project in San Fran-
cisco and the Charlotte area Quilt
Display Coordinator.

The NAMES Project Quilt
will displayed ‘in’ 12 by’ 12 foot
sections, with 8 panels each. Each
panel, roughly the size of a grave,
memorializes an individual who
has died of AIDS.

Davidson can expect another
informative event when Dr. Ruth
Westheimer hosts alecture on sexu-
ality in Love Auditorium Novem-
ber 9.

On November 7 and 8 the Stu-

dent Health Fair aims to inform |

students about AIDS. - The Fair
will be held in the Union.

On November 12, FLAG (Friends
of Lesbians and Gays) will spon-
sor a slide show / fashion show in

the 900 room. All proceeds from —

the show will benefit House of
Mercy, Hospice at Charlotte, and
the Metroline AIDS Project.

College welcomes 451 freshmen

Frosh continued from page 1

In this class, there are at least
40 senior class presidents, and
about 25% of the class was in-
volved in volunteer literacy
progrems. Somewhere in the mix
is anationally ranked figure skater,
a published poet, a violin virtuoso,
and acattle rancher. The President
of Sri Lanka and the Chinese am-
bassador to Greenland are BtpD
ably in there, too.

The money used to bring them
here was given to 35% according
to need and to 15% according: to
merit.

The incoming Davidson stu-
dents get better and better each
year, and their desire to enroll says
something wonderful about the
institution. Soon, Davidson will
hopefully emerge from its unfortu-
nate “Princeton of the South” label
and become “Davidson of the
World.”

Archivist leaves many memories of long Davidson career

director of the library. Davidson
éarned his M.A. (1930) and Ph.D.

(1942) in history from Harvard .

University and his master’s in li-
‘brary science from the University
of Chicago (1936). Before joining
Davidson’s faculty, he taught for a
year each at the Blue Ridge School
for Boys in Hendersonville, N.C.,
Chamberlain Hunt Military Acad-
emy in Port Gibson, M.S., and The
Citadel in Charleston, S.C.

As director of three separate
library buildings on campus, the
Carnegie Library, the Hugh A. and
Jane Parks Grey Memorial Library,
and the E.H. Little Library,
Davidson oversaw an expansion
from 39,000 volumes in 1936 to
over 200,000 at his retirement in
1975. After retiring as professor of
history in 1976, Davidson held the
position of College Archivist, tak-

ing charge of the Davidsoniana
Room andthe Rare Book Room.
In recognition of his service to the
college, the library’s computerized
card catalogue system was chris-
tened “CHAL” (Computerized
Help At Little) following its instal-
lation in 1991.

A gifted writer, Davidson
authored ten books and two un-

published manuscripts during his_
life. His book “Piedmont Parti- -

san,” first published in 1951, is
listed as one of the “One Hundred
Outstanding. Books About North
Carolina.” ;

~ In 1993 Davideon received
North Carolina’s highest civilian
honor, The Order of the Long Leaf
Pine, which recognizes those who
exhibit dutstanding effort in career
and community activities and are
of exceptional benefit to the state.
Davidson also received the Charles
A. Cannon Award for contribution

to North Carolina history (1951),
the U.D.C. Military Cross (1970),
the Award of Merit from the North
Carolina Society of County and

Local Historians (1971), Teacher

of the Year by the South Carolina
Daughters of Colonial Wars
(1972), and the Davidson College
Alumni Service Award (1988).

* Davidson resided with his

wife, Alice Gage, in the town of

Davidson at “Beaver Dam.” Re-
stored in 1975, the home once be-
longed to Major William Lee
Davidson, Jr. from whom Davidson
College acquired the land on which
the school now stands. Davidson is
survived by his wife, three chil-
dren and four grandchildren. He is
buried at the Davidson Family
Cemetery at Rural Hill in Northern
Mecklenburg County. Memorials
may be made to Davidson College,

newspapers use. She adds, “It may
land you a summer job.”

Betz brings other ideas to this
year’s book. She hopes to coordi-
nate the taking of students photos

with the distribution of last year’s

books, providing an incentive for
everyone to have his or her picture
taken.

Betz is excited about her posi-
tion because “we basically co-edit
an entire book of about 300 pages.”

New photography editor Joe

ips and Cranks awaits publishing

Kastell will focus on action photos
taken by yearbook staff. Last year
staff members set up picture col-
lection envelopes and even went
door-to-door for photos, but stu-
dent response was low; therefore,
certain groups of people who turned
in pictures may be disproportion-
ately represented.

Tentatively, an August arrival
date is scheduled for next
year’ sQuips and Cranks which will
be mailed to the class of ’95,
