Padres Pitching Wins World Series For Tigers

By STEVE BYERS

With all due respect to Kirk Gibson
and Jack Morris, the Detroit Tigers
won the 1984 World Series because of
this number — 13.94. That was the
ERA of the San Diego Padres’ four
starting pitchers in the five-game

series. You are hot going to win many ~

games when your starters can’t survive
the first inning.

In the last game, mental mistakes
by San Diego’s Alan Wiggins and
Garry Templeton certainly didn’t help
their cause. Not to mention that
“Goose” Gossage might as well have
been throwing batting practice for all
the effect he had. But it was only fair
that Detroit win it all, for the Tigers
were the best team from Day One.
After Sunday, is there any doubt that
the best baseball is played in the AL
East?

And speaking of football, guess
who has the best overall record in the

ACC. Why, Virginia, of course — that

powerhouse of college football. Guess

who is tied for the worst overall re-

cord. That’s right. How ‘bout them

Heels? This Saturday night at 7:30

Leonard Nimoy goes “In Search Of
. . .” the North Carolina defense.

Well, Oklahoma played Texas
Saturday in a rain-soaked battle for the
No. | ranking. So what happened? The
referees did everything but kick Texas’
field goal, as they helped the Lon-
ghorns squeak out a 15-15 tie. And the
Washington Huskies said thank you
very much, as they leapfrogged both
teams to the top spot.

In pro football, add Gale Sayers to
the roll of the “I Think Franco Harris Is
A Sissie” Club. Founder and club pres-
ident Jim Brown is glad to have him.
Welcome to the NFL, Warren Moon,
whose Houston Oilers are 0-7 and are
actually worse than their record indi-
cates, if that’s possible. The Redskins
look as if they are getting their act to-
gether, but the last time Miami began

its season 7-0, we all remember what
happened to Washington in January.

When are the media and the public
going to stop giving stock car racing
the attention it does not deserve? Some
people claim that: driving a car at
speeds of 150 mph around an oval for
three hours every Sunday requires
great athletic skill. (These are the same
people who think “The Dukes of Haz-
zard” is the best show on TV). I say it
requires half a brain, four good tires, a
great pit crew, a pronounced Sauthern
accent, a chewing tobacco sponsor,
and a lot of luck.

Basketball practice _ officially
started Monday. Which means all true
sports addicts can write off studying on
Monday and Wednesday nights and
Saturday and Sunday afternoons of
winter term. Go ahead and plan on it
— your GPA will nosedive next term if
you like basketball. And if you don’t
enjoy basketball? Well, you're a book-
worm, and you belong in the library
with the other culturally deprived stu-

dents.

Things I would like to see (but will
never happen) this upcoming basket-
ball season . . . Dean Smith losing his
temper ... Dean Smith actually
criticizing an opponent .. . Carolina
not winning 20 games .. . Jim Val-
vano saying his freshmen recruits are
illiterate and are in school only to play
basketball .. . Kansas Coach Larry
Brown admitting he hired Ed Manning
to lure son Danny .. . Depaul run-
ning a disciplined offense . . . some-
body stuffing a sock in Al McGuire's
mouth

Until next week, sports fans, let
me leave you with this quote from the
Dec. !, 1969 issue of Sports Ilus-
trated by Davidson sports information
director Emil Parker: “If {Eric] Minkin
can force either [Mike] Maloy or
{Doug] Cook to a wing position, we
{Davidson} will win the national
championship — easy.”

Ouch, that hurts.

Tennis Team To Play N.C.’s Best At Tournament

By STEVE BYERS

The men’s tennis team travels to
Durham this weekend for a tournament
featuring the top college programs in
North Carolina. The Wildcats have been
playing round-robin matches against
each other this past week to prepare for
the tournament.

Coach Jeff Frank said, “We are a
young team, but good. We just don’t
know how good yet, and this weekend
should help us find out. We've been try-
ing to get our guys ‘match tough’ this
fall, because that’s our biggest weakness
over the summer compared to teams like
UT-C and Furman.”

this fall and probably will still be there
when the season officially begins in early
March. “I think Sedge is at the point
where he can play with anybody in the
Southern Conference, on aay surface, on
any day,” Frank said. Sophomore Hayes
Dallas will occupy the second singles
position. Dallas returns after an impres-
sive freshman season.

What really has Frank excited,
though, is the play of his freshmen so far.
In fact, for this weekend's tournament,
three freshmen will form the heart of
Davidson's top eight. Rick Hodge, Jim
Thompson and Bill Young will play
three, four, and five singles, respec-
tively.

and enthusiastic, which rubs off on the
rest of the team. They're just playing
Super tennis so far, but I want to see how
they do this weekend against top players
in a tournament situation,” Frank said.

The last three singles positions will
be junior Bobby Nichols at six, senior
John Hackett at seven and sophomore
“Monk” Meyer at eight. Meyer barely
edged out sophomore Tripp Caldwell for
the last slot.

The team hosts a tournament during
Parents’ Weekend and travels to States-

ville and ultimately Amelia Island,
Florida (over Spring Break) for more
tournaments before the season begins.

There is both good news and bad
news for the Wildcats next spring. The
good news is that the new indoor tennis
facility (with four hard courts) should be
ready by Feb. |. The bad news is that
once again Davidson faces an uphill bat-
tle in the Southern Conference, UT-C is
loaded and has to be the preseason favor-
ite, while Furman returns all its players
from last year’s strong squad.

Rugby Excites And Bruises

By ANDY BARRON

The Davidson Rugby Club is alive
and well. With over 30 members par-
ticipating at various levels of dedication,
the club is able to put both an “A” and a
“B” team on the field, The “A” team cur-
rently sports a I-I-1 record, while the
“B” team is 1-2.

“We've improved a lot over last
year,” junior Griff Elder said. “We've
gota lot of freshmen out and I think that's
helping us.”

Davidson has helped its own record
by scheduling Belmont Abbey twice.
The Cats won the first game 15-7 and
tied the second 8-8. The one loss of the
season was at the hands of UNC-
Greensboro in a score that no one would
reveal if they knew what it was.

Many people who know rugby only
by shirts that say “Give Blood. Play
Rugby!" or bumperstickers that say
“Support Your Local Hooker’ might
want to know why anyone would want to
play the game. Some reasons:

Sophomore John Reynolds said, “A
lot of former high schoo! football! and
soccer players play rugby to try a new
sport. There's also all the beer we drink.”

Junior Paul Weiss said, “You only
train three days a week and then you get
to bust heads and drink a lot of beer.
What more do ya’ want?"

Freshman Russell Booker added,
“Everyone has a great sense of humor.
There's a certain aura about rugby
players. The training rules are also le-
nient."

Rugby can be a very exciting, slick.
and smoothly executed sport, but that's
rare. Most of the time the sport is easily
as violent as its reputation claims, What
would you expect to happen if you let 30
madmen on the same field at once with
cach one attempting to dish out more
than he takes?

“When you have a good referee.
tugby isn’t that dangerous,” sophomore
Perry Mathewes said. “However, if you
have someone who doesn’t know what
he’s doing, you run into big trouble.
That’s what happened in our last game.”

That reference is to Davidson's sec-
ond game with Belmont Abbey. A mem-
ber of the opposition constantly violated
the rule against high tackling, a danger-
ous part of rugby. Before the game was
over, freshman Edward Patte had a bro-
ken nose and senior Joe McMuilen had
been thrown out after “complaining” to
the referee about a few suspect calls.
Things turned out okay, though. because
the “cheap shot artist” in question didn't
show up at the post-game party.

“Though there is always a lot of ten-
sion in the game, everyone is really
sporting and calms down for the party.”
freshman Glenn Fogle said. “Partying
with the other team is just part of the
game. Everyone's too tired to fight any-
way.”

The rugby team travels to Myrtle
Beach this weekend for a match and any-
thing else they can find. They will host
Guilford during Parents’ Weekend and
against Duke the following weekend.
Come out and see what rugby's all about.
