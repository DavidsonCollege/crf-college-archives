Y's
CORNER

“A Night In the Trailer” Or “Cries
From The Hole Of The Mole”

It isn’t the most desirable life
to wake up in the night with rab-
bits crawling all over you and old
joke books hitting you in the head:
but when you think of how the rest

of the world is getting along you
have to hold on to what you've got.
Still it’s a horrible thing. The
first day | went around I thought
the place was deserted, and. mak.
ing as little noise as possible which
was none at all, except for pulling

off the door that leads into the par-/|

stairs), and 1 hope Te never get
that cold, helyfless feeling again.
There it sat., I cut on the radio,
because I néeded company. Jn the
west cornér of the place, through
the spider webs that seemed to be
permasfent fixturas and through
the dust that a little black cat
made, pitifully and hysterically go-
ing from_one wall to the other in
Search of a way out, I saw that
thing, which first I though was
something the Indians had used to
drive away evil spirits, or something
that the cave man chad used to
scare man-eating dinasors, and then
T even feared that the di t.’s were
coming back. But nol Nothing so
kind asxthat did fate ‘lend me. I
saw it breathing! And then T heard
words come out of it. It said, “The
Mole is in his counting house count-
ing out his money.” You. would
have screamed too. When I did, he
looked up at me and an ace of
spades fell out of hair. His
smile kinda waved to me, showing
first one tooth and then another
(or_the_ other), Words ‘dripped
from his smile, ‘and d he said, “I say.

a nickel, and he mumbled some-
thing I didn't quite get. I thought
he said “You bring the Mole a
gift just for fun?” But I found out
that he was speaking of a gift
fund. He gave me a bowl of cold
porridge and kept talking about

YMCA Men
Lead Synod

Davidson Students Hold
Important Positions in
Church Work

By JOHN FAIRLY

The strains of “O, Davidson"
echoed through the hall. No, it
was not the freshmen bellowing
forth ce a pep meeting the
newer gym, It was in the dining
AyalllastAdigust. at_the_Montreat
Leadership School for young people,
where the Synod's young peoples’
councils of all the Synods of the
Southern Presbyterian church were
gathered .

No one knows, who first got up
and begaa the song. but in a orom-
ent aff the Davidson mea in the
hall were standing for the honor
of their Alma Mater and were sing-
ing the traditional sang in a lusty,
if not particularly harmoniows man-
fer. The “interesting wing was
how many were standing, for it
showed very conspiciousty how ac-
tive Davdson men are in the church's
voung peoples’. work.

Those who stood in that dining
Jyall -represenfed six of -the synod!s
councils, Two were synod’s pres-
idents, Charlie Parrish of North
Carolina, and Jim McCrary of Ark-
ansas. Naturally, North Carolina
has the largest Davidson delega-
tion, ineluding six of their council.
Besdies the president. Rob Miller
.is chairmans of the Highway Be-
vond the Seas, Ed Hay of the High-
way into the Homeland, and_Jerry
Newbold of the Highway of Com-
radeship. In addition .Alfred Me-
Nair and George Ogilvie are two of
North Carolina's Preshytery presi-
dents, MeNair—of Orange Presby-
tery, and Ogilvie of Winston Salem
Presbytery.

Tank Watt. the vice-president of
Thé Georgia Council represents Da>
vidson in that Synod. Serving -as
a highway chairman is Alf Taylor,
the chairman of the Highway Be-
yond the Seas on Tennessece’s coun-
cil. * There- are four. Presbytqry
oresidents, who also serve as mem-
bers of their respective synod’s
councils, who are now at Davidson.
In addition to those in North Car-
rotinta are Gory: Simmons, - president |-—
of Suwannee Presbytery in Florida
and John Fairly, president of East
Hanover in Virginia.

° However, these represent only a
small portion of the Davidson men
who take an active part in young
peoplés’ organizations in the church.
Many are accomplishng great tliings
on Presbytery councils, besides
those who have been interested in
young peoples’ activities in their
homé churches. Davidson seems to
be carrying its load in supporting
the church through its young peo-
ples’ organization.
