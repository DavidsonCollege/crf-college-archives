Fencing club parries

minority sports problem

By DAVE KELLER

Ronald Colman and Errol Flynn,
don’t give up hope! Swashbuckling is
‘alive and well at Davidson College in
the form of the newly-formed David-
son fencing club.

Begun in earnest at the end of fall
term this year, the club owes its
existence primarily -to Irishman

- Robert Nicholson, an exchange stu-
dent from Dublin University.

Nicholson, who learned fencing
during gradé school in Scotland,
wanted to come to Davidson but
couldn’t scrape up all the cash he
needed; a Davidson alumnus and
ardent fencer named Dr. Doug Glas-
gow (who also learned the sport in
Scotland) came to the rescue with
finances on the understanding that
Nicholson would help fencing get off
the ground here.

All this year, then, Robert has been
teaching the P.E. class, organizing
the club, and doing everything in
general to promote the ancient sport
on campus.

Right now the club is small, about
six core members, and is composed of
a diverse group: experienced fencers,
graduates from the P.E. course, and
beginners to whom uniqueness of the
sport has appealed.

Nicholson, who was the captain of
his home club, said that ‘‘a number of
fencers have drifted through, but only
a few have stuck the whole way. It’s
rather slack this term.’’ ,

He added that the critical period for
a fencer is his first six months to a
year, when he is just learning.

At this point, the fencers don’t yetr
have club sport status--they merely
fence among themselves.

Both Nicholson and coach Sterling
Martin, who is in charge of the
fencing class, agree that at this point
the club is not large enough or
versatile enough (Davidson fencers
only use one of the three types of
sword fighting (foil fencing) to com-
pete intercollegiately. ‘‘In the fu-
ture,’’ added Nicholson, ‘‘Duke,
Chapel Hill and Charlotte fencers
could very well provide club-type
competition.”

Martin said that the fencing class
was initiated on campus 4a-
bout eight years ago with a club in
mind. ‘‘At this point, though, we

can’t hope for another intercollegiate
sport,” he stated. Other problems
recognized in starting serious fencing

Support

here are lack of electronic equipment
(necessary in modern fencing) and of a
full-time coach.

Martin added, though, that several
faculty members were very competent
fencers capable of coaching, and
said,‘‘I can see a team in the distant
future.”

Fencing, however, faces the same
problem of most small club sports--it
is a unique, elite sport, whose
perpetuation depends solely on a few
people. Its fate lies in the hands of
interested fencers and whatever
individual chooses to organize it..
vidual choosea to organize it.

_ Nicholson will be leaving this
spring, but he hopes that he can leave
some of his love for fencing with him.
“Fencing is artistic,” he said, ‘it has
a special flavor; I’d like to see more of
it done here, and I'd feel very
disappointed if it dropped. The club is
at a very critical point now--it has to
keep growing or it will fold.”

social life studied

[Continued from page 3]

4 typical Davidson male as reflected in
‘the survey, except the freshman

males who underestimated the pat-
tern.

Everyone tended to underestimate
female dating patterns by responding
that the typical Davidson woman
dates one or two times a month. With
both males and females, the percen-

, tage of people dating one person ex-

clusively tends to increase with class.

No more than four percent of the
respondents have met most of their
dates in the Union. The major
percentage meet most of their dates
through friends. Over 75 percent of all
women reply that most of their dates
come from Davidson College while the
highest percentage (40 percent) of
upperclass males report the same.

The highest percentage for fresh-
man males is 33 percent of their dates
from their hometown.

Less than four percent of all
females report that the most impor-
tant characteristic in choosing a date
is physical appearance. Among men,
the percentage citing physical ap-
pearance as the most important
ranged trom nine to 26 percent. For 70
percent of all females responding and
45 percent of all males, personality is
the most important characteristic.

40 percent of all males have never
been asked out by a member of the
opposite sex. 90 percent would have
no objections. 62 percent of freshman
males, 41 percent of sophopmore
males, 58 percent of junior males, and
37 percent of senior males always pay
for both parties on a date where
money is involved. 13 percent of
fresuman. women, 40 percent of
sophomore women, and four percent
of junior women never pay their own
way on a date.

The typical Davidson student has
mostly casual dates though men have
a slight tendency for formal dates.
Patterson Court and off-campus are

the places most females go most
often, while the major percentage of
the males go off-campus most often.

No more than six percent of the
men and 15 percent of the women
have most of their dates at the Union.
Seven percent of the sophomore
females (who date more than anyone
else) report that dating does not
interfere with their academic life. The
figure rise to 19 percent for junior

males and females.
Ten percent of all students feel

family pressure to date while 15
percent feel peer pressure. On Big
Weekends, 65 percent of the women
and 39 percent of the upperclass men
attend activities with someone from
Davidson; 19 percent attend with
someone from another college in the

ae responses of male freshmen _
are spread evenlybetween the college,
their hometown, and other coileges in
the area. 36 percent of all males and
58 percent of all females would feel
reluctant to attend a big weekend

concert alone.
A space for additional comments

was on the questionnaire. Six of the
respondents remarked on the fact that

‘there was no definition of dating

given. Some form of dissatisfaction
with Davidson social life was exp-
ressed by 28 percent of the respon-
dents.

- Several people, mentioned the lack
of a strong fraternity system as a
factor in their dissatisfaction. A good
number agreed with one freshman
male who wrote that ‘‘not enough
girls are available.” ,

Several people complained that
they are labeled as someone’s pro-
perty after one date.

Some feel that Davidson womeneare
not attractive enough. Many cited a
“conservative’’ dating situation as a
problem. A sophomore female wrote
of a ‘‘prejudice against singles”’ citing
the higher cost a single person must —
pay at some function. -
