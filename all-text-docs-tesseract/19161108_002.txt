The editors of THe Davipsontan
have received considerable criticism from
some of the students during the past
week, not for the stand it took with ref-
erence to the misconduct in church, but
jor taking a stand at all. They say that
the paper will be read by friends and
alumni, who will lower their opinion of
the college, and consequently what was
said ‘will hurt Davidson more than it
will help the cause.

‘The purpose of Trt Davipsonian is
not to,set forth only the glories and vir-
tues of the college, and hide that which
is unlovely. The ideal of Tre Davin-
SONIAN is ta he an expression of the
best and truest spirit that pervades the
campus, If any action is shown that
arouses the condemnation of this real
spirit of Davidson, then THe Davin-
SONIAN must denounce that action.

However, friends and alumni who
read what was said last week ‘will at
least see that the true spirit of the cam-
pus is opposed to such action.

Alumni and students will recall that
the Davidson Song contest closes on the
1sth of November. As yet not a single
contribtuion has been received. David-
son needs a ‘‘war-song.” If not for the
sake of a tennis raquet, then for the sake
of your Alma Mater, stir up your in-
genuity, rejuvenate your creative and
poctical powers, throw procrastination
and modesty to the winds, and compose
asong. And, sir, you will receive more
than a tennis raquet, you will have the
gratitude of students and alumni, and
the knowledge that your efforts will
catry Davidson on to victory. Trv it.

A VOTE OF THANKS.

THe Davinsonian Staff, in behalf
of the Studetit Body. wishes to take this
method of thanking Mr. Stiles M.
Brunson, of Roanoke, Va., for his kind-
ness in forwarding telegraphic accounts
of the Davidson-Roanoke game, October
28th. Mr. Brunson is an old Davidson
man, and will soon go to New York to
accept a position on the staff of a well-
known financial magazine.

The DAVIDSONIAN, November 8. 1916

Y. M. C. A. MEETING.

The Y. M. C. A. meeting of last
week was in the nature of a song serv-
ice. Several members of the orchestr:
gave instrumental selections which were
greatly appreciated. ‘The meeting wa
then given over to several speakers, wh:
discussed the problem of attendance at
the Thursday night meetings from vari-
ous viewpoints.

T. Henderson, '17, spoke first.
stating as his opinion that as the stu-
dents payed their Y. M. C. A. fee in
‘he Blanket Fee and not out of thei:
own pockets, they did not have as much
interest in the organization.

W. C. Cumming, '18, gave as an-
other reason for the poor attendance the
fact that students made the speeches
and not men from other places. How-
ever, he upheld the student speakers
and said that they had done faithful
work.

J. K. Hobson, '17, and H. B. Fras-
er, '18, also gave short discussions on
the same subject. At the request of the
leader, Dr. Arbuckle made a short talk.
stating that the college student becomes
so taken up with other things that he
docs not realize his need of religions
thins such as the Y. M. C. A. He
said that the Y. M. C. A. was the most
helpful religious organization for the
students in college. The meeting closed
with a selection by the orchestra and
invocation.

LYCEUM ATTRACTION
GIVEN SATURDAY NIGHT

On last Saturday night, in Shearer
Hall, the second number in the Lyceum
course being presented here this year was
given, this attraction being the West-
minster Concert Entertainers. The en-
tertainment was much above the usual
standard, and was enjoved by all present.

The personnel of the company was
Miss Dorothy Cole, reader and pianist ;
Miss Iras Wilson, suprona, and Mr.
Larry Ball, Scotch songs and stories, but
they displayed versatility and added va-
tiety to their program by being able to
do more than one thing well. Mise
Cole’s recitations showed talent, and
both her humorous and dramatic selec-
tions were well received, while Miss

-Wilson delighted all with her solo work

especially her Japanese songs. Mr.
Ball, dressed in the Scotch costume, add-
ed an interesting feature with his hu-
morous Scotch songs.

ANNUAL PHOTOGRAPHER
ON HILL THIS WEEK

The photographer arrived Monday
morning for the purpose of taking the
pictures for this year's Annual. Most
of the groups and individual pictures
have been taken. The individual pic-
tures are being made in the Social Cen
ter, and all who have not done so should
have their's made at once.

The manager is doing his utmost to
have all the pictures made this fall so
that the publishers will not be so rushed
as has heen the case in previous years.

There are a number of new clubs
which have been organized since last
year’s annual went to press, and these
will add to the appearance of the Year
Book of 1919.
