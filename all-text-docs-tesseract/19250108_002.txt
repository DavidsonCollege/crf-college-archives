Dear Students: Since both the Open

absolutely to publish my plea in their
allotted columns, and Mr. Chaff doesn't
recognize desirable copy, I shall appeal
you. directly—through the columns
and print of our own Davidsonian.

Gentlemen, do you realize that we are
living in the millenium? Has the de-
lightful discovery yet been yours? Now
the ideal of 50 years has been realized.

The Final “Y” Service

Popular Professor Will Bring Final
Message of Year to Davidson
Students

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle will be the speak-
er for the Y. M. C. A. service next Sunday
night. He is popular both on the cam-
pus and in town. Everybody knows the
kind of addresses he can deliver, and so
may judge for himself as to whether he
can afford to miss this one or not. His
splendid messages for all occasieve have
done a great deal to make him one of
the favored professors among the stu-
dents.

This is the last service before Christ-
mas and is going to be a Christmas serv-
ice. Music will be one of the main fea-
tures. Special numbers will be given,
jand “Sim” Bryant will lead a number of
suitable songs.

A good attendance is expected at this,
the last service before Christmas to get
the right spirit for the holidays from the
“Y.” The larger the number who join in
the songs, the merrier they will be, and
the better the start that each one will
get toward a Merry Christmas and a

‘Happy New Year.
