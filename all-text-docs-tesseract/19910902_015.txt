team wenton aretreat the weekend
of the 24th and 25th to continue
their preparations for the upcom-

Presbyterian Retreat in Banner Elk,
North Carolina as home base, the
Davidson harriers ran workouts
along the Blue Ridge Parkway near
Grandfather Mountain, and along
the mountain roads nearby. Every-

Fagg Takes

By Bruce Page

Davidson head football coach
Dave Fagg says there is only one
game on the Wildcats’ schedule
this year: September 7 at Guilford
College. That’s as far ahead as he
wants his team to focus, anyway.
Fagg says that if Davidson is to
equal last year’s impressive 6-3
record, the players will have to
look at one and only one game at a
time.

Davidson’s football players
returned to preseason camp on
August 11, and from then until
August 24 the coaching staff held
aminimum of two practices aday,
such that the team is now, accord-
ing to Fagg, “mentally and physi-
cally ready to go. He also said that
the ‘Cats came to camp in great
shape, with all of the starters in-

preparing each 1 runner with an
individual training program, and
the assistance of Coach Beth
Manson in the weight room is
helping these runners achieve their
physical best. The freshmen have
learned the technical meaning of
VOM (Maximum Volume of
Oxygen Intake) and AT (Anaero-
bic Threshold).

The Wildcats are using these
training techniques toincrease their
runners’ performance, durability,
and power. Accompanied with
quality bases of distance mileage

that was run over the summer, the
‘Cats will be better prepared to
meet the challenges and climb thé
hills out on the cross country
courses of the South.

Seniors Kathy Beach and Chris
Otrok should use their experience
and considerable talents to lead the
team.

Davidson’s first competition
is this weekend at the Davidson
Alumni Race, where this year’s
team will compete against
Davidson Alumni.

jury-free.

The 1991 schedule consists of
9 games, five of them against teams
that Davidson played last year. The
Wildcats came outon top in four of
those five games.

_ The team’s divisional status is
still in limbo. Davidson, as an
athletic program, rejoined the
Southern Conference, but the

rulings on the status of small
schools like Davidson. Davidson
football is currently a Division III
team waiting for Division I-AAA
status.

The ‘Cats lost 10 starters to
graduation and afew more players
to attrition, but this year’s roster
has as many players as did last

men, including 7 seniors. Among

streaks of 10 and 14 games and
three tournament titles, you would
think that the Davidson volleyball
team would have very little left to
prove. Yet coach Rebecca Hawk-
ins (last year’s Big South Coach of
the Year) says that this year’s team.
is distinguished by an obvious
“hunger.” That hunger stems from
the team’s disappointment at sec-
ond place finishes last year in both
the Big South regular season and
tournament.

Every player returns from that
team, the winningest in school

‘history in any sport, and Hawkins
reports that “everybody wants that
title.” Standing in their way is a
bulked-up schedule that includes
more non-conference opponents
and aconference full of teams that
have, as Hawkins says, put the
‘Cats “on their hit list.”

There is no doubt that the team
has the full attention of the Big
South. A poll of the conference’s
volleyball coaches and sports in-
formation directors picked

Davidson to finish first. But Hawk-—

ins, while pleased at the accolade,
concedes that there is “nota whole
lot of value” in such polls, After
all, last year’s team was predicted
to finish sixth by the same presea-

son poll. \
_ This year’s Wildcats, though,
are alogical first-place pick. Lead-
ing the returning castare senior co-
captains (and four-year starters)
Mimi Plauche and Holt Hathaway.
Plauche, amiddle hitter, and Hatha-
way, asetter, were given the moni-

ker “The Freshman Connection” ,

in 1988, and since then have prac-
tically become synonymous with
Davidson. Volleyball. Last year,
both were named to the All-Big
South first team and to four all-
tournament teams, but were per-
haps most effective in their roles as

Hawkins’ “on-the-courtcoaches.”
Amy Howard was Davidson’s

top freshman a year ago, and re-
turns to wreak havoc at her outside
hitter position. Juniors Catherine
Milligan and :Janet Delery (the
Most Improved Player in 1990)
and senior sparkplug Christy
Knight should also see plenty of
time at outside hitter. At. middle
hitter, Plauche is aided by junior
Jennie Wagner and sophomore
Katherine Anderson. Time behind
Hathaway atsetter should be shared
by freshman Lorie Logan and
sophomore Jennifer Guise, while

‘Thompson will make her custom-
ary intense contribution in the
backcourt.

offensive starters, 7 defensive start-
ers and the kicker/punter.

Fagg says that the class of ‘95
is a solid recruiting class which
should fulfill the depth void left by
the players who left last year. He is
particularly pleased with the depth
at the quarterback, where sopho-
more Richard Howell is the in-
cumbent starter, backed up by
senior Matt Matheny and two fresh-
men. :
Fagg’s short-term goals for the
team are always the next game on
the schedule.

His long-term goals are finan-
cial independence for the team and
an undefeated season.

sibility.

The bulk of the ‘Cats competi-
tion for the conference crown
should come from Radford (19-16
last year) and UNC-Asheville (16-
18 in 1990). Both the Highlanders,
who won the Big South Tourna-
ment last season, and the Bull-
dogs, who took the regular season

title, return 4 starters and 7 letter-

men. Conference newcomers Lib-
erty, who went 17-15.and advanced
to. the finals of the East Coast
Athletic Conference Tournament
a year ago, could also make a bid
for the championship.

Thenon-conference portion of
the schedule will make a record
like last year’s very difficult to
attain, but should help to raise the
program to a higher level. The
Wildcats face future Southern
Conference opponents Furman and
Appalachian State, in addition to
strong teams like Georgia Tech,
Tennessee-Martin and UNC-
Greensboro.

You would expecta little bitof
complacency in the team aftersuch

a successful season, but, quite the _

opposite, the “Cats are united in the
pursuit of a common goal. For

Big Changes
For Women's Soccer

The 1991 season promises to
be a year of change for the
women’s soccer team as they
continue to improve in their third
year as a varsity program.
Changes are also assured because
the team is under the direction of
new coach Kevin Hundley.

Hundley, who just arrived at
Davidson in August, took over
for Diane Boettcher. Hundley has
worked at Davidson for the past
ten yearsinconnection with mens’
soccer coach Charlie Slagle’s soc-
cer camps. “I know Davidson
College and Davidson students,”
said Hundley. “That is an advan-
tage. I wasn’t as unprepared or as
unknowing as it might seem.”

Despite the rapid transition
and the relative unfamiliarity of
the situation, Hundley still has
high expectations for the team.
Hundley projects a positive tone
and patience that should mesh
well with a Wildcat squad domi-
nated by freshmen and sopho-
mores. “My expectations are that
the program willcontinue to grow
as we become a legitimate Divi-
sion I program,” said Hundley.

The Wildcats will play a var-
ied scheduleranging from an ACC
team to a club team. This wide
scope makes numerical predic-
tions for winsand losses difficult.
Davidson was 7-10-1 last year.
Hundley does not want to empha-
size the team’s record, but would
like to see the team progress in
less tangible ways. Hundley cited
games with Radford and Erskine
as key tests of how the ‘Cats are
improving. In the first two years
of competition Radford and Er-
skine have both handed Davidson
lopsided defeats. “We can still
lose and feel good about it, if we

can narrow the gaps in games like
those,” said Hundley.

Coleman, whoallowed only 2 goals
agame in her freshman campaign,
will provide the backbone for the
defense.

Largely because of the intense
schedule they will face this year,
the ‘Cats are looking toward the

cats where they stand and hope-
fully where the program can head.
Hundley is optimistic for the fu-
ture of the program. “The Ath-
letic Department and the school
have made a serious commitment
to build a legitimate program
here,” said Hundley. “They have
given us the financial and admin-
istrative support to make it suc-
cessful.”

- Hundley has used the first
week of practice to get to know
the players and to evaluate the
talent. “I’ve been really happy
with the teams’ reaction to the
change. They have done every-
thing I’ve asked of them,” said
Hundley.

The team is made up of 14
freshmen and sophomores and
only seven juniors and seniors.
Second year captain senior Liz
Clarke should lead the team both
on and off the field. She will be
helped offensively by freshman
Ellen Sprinkle. The other senior
captain, Annie Adams will con-
trol the midfield along with Ann
Todd and Susan Taylor. Jenny
Satterfield will anchor the de-
fense and try to keep the ball
away form Courtney Robertson
or freshman Liz Schaper in goal.
“Both players will see time in
goal, until one clearly emerges,”
said Hundley. “Butthere are sev-
eral back to back games in the
schedule, which should give them
both an opportunity to play.”

The team should play an ag-
gressive, but controlled style of
soccer, which Hundley hopcs to
encourage by not dwelling on
mistakes. “We are going to try to
posses the ball in terms of style,”
said Hundley. “I want the mis-
takes to be madc trying to do
things in a positive way, rather
than a negative way.”

With a roster full of young
players and the college’s new
commitment to women’s athlet-
ics, Hundley is right in his asses-
ment that «he women’s soccer
program is a team with a future.

season with a tinge of uncertainty.

“There is so much pressure to
come together as a team,” said
Roos “but we can do it.”

“This will be an expanding year
for us,” said Pryor. “Our record
may notreflect the same success as
last year’s in wins and losses.”

Nevertheless, she expects that
“our play will be much better at the
end of the year against the tougher
teams.”
