Small town U.S.A goes. big city?

Town meeting dicusses future
development that might threaten the
small town charm of Davidson.

By Randy Hartwell

Students at Davidson often
complain that the town is “in the
middle of nowhere;” however, if
new subdivisions, roads, anda bur-
geoning elementary school are any

indication, the town will soon be
on the map. At an unusually well-
attended Board of Commissioners
meeting at the Davidson Town Hall
on Tuesday night, concerned citi-
zens met to voice opinions on re-
cent and future growth in the Lake
Norman area,

Atthe meeting, the town coun-
cil decided to adopt a 12-month
moratorium on new subdivisions
in Davidson, which will prevent
construction (until October 1995)
of any housing units past the ap-
proximately 1,900 that have al-
ready met zoning and plat approval.
This will give bursting-at-the-

small reprieve from the influx of

young children cited the excellent
school system as a primary reason
for moving from Virginia to
Davidson a year ago. ‘We must
protect quality,” she says.

The council also decided to

Though the plan has
been in existence since the 1970's,
most town residents were unaware
of intentions to build new roads in
the area. Town planner Tim Keen
says, “it’s just now that we’ re see-
ing growth” that would necessitate
construction of new thoroughfares

Recently, Davidsonians have had a taste of big city life with the unusual amount of traffic.

in Davidson.

The moratorium on subdivi-
sions and delay in road planning
will allow time for Keen and the
planning commission to “take a

comprehensive look” at future
transportation and land use néeds
in Davidson. Though Davidson
students are transient residents of
the town, they do make up roughly

half the population. Because of
this, Keen stresses the need to “in-
volve the student body— We defi-

‘nitely have to have their participa-
tion.”

Get the gossip about how your class

The first few grueling weeks
of Davidson’s infamous workload
led hundreds of exhausted students
eagerly to anticipate last week’s
fall break. Students spent their
extra time in different ways.

Homeward Bound

The most popular destination
seemed to be home. After tiring
(and often expensive) road and
plane trips, many freshmen dis-
covered that their new homes were
at college. “It was nice to see my
family, but by Friday night, I was
ready to come back to school,”
says Donna Gribble. Jarret

Weinpel had not been planning to
go home for Fall Break until his
15-year-old sister called him two
weeks ago. She had found some
babysitting money she forgot and
told Weinpel that she would buy
his ticket to New Jersey. It was an
offer he could not refuse: “Every-
thing worked out perfectly. Isn’t
my sister amazing?!”
Buddy Reunions

Other students took off for
other colleges to visit old high
school friends. Aylin Somerson
and Berna Demiralp, Turkish in-
ternational students, went to Duke
University for the long weekend.

“We went around in a big Turkish
group,” Berna says. “It was really
fun!” Abbey Bergsma, a native of
Louisiana, made her way up to
Barnard and NYU in New York.

She had one exciting adventure

after another up ‘there, including’

finding herself in a parade of Mario
Cuomo enthusiasts.
Davidson Outdoors

Adventurous Wildcats elected
to go on one of the several fall
break trips offered by Davidson
Outdoors. The trips included
whitewater rafting, kayaking,
mountain biking, and hang glid-
ing. John Roe went on the begin-

mates spent

ners’ kayaking trip. He enjoyed
his passage through classes I, II,
and III rapids so much that he says,
“Thad so much fun thatI wantto go
out and buy a kayak right now!”
Serving the Community
The Chaplain’s office and the
Service Coordinator co-sponsored
a service trip to Candor, North
Carolina—a predominantly His-
panic community. There, 14 stu-
dents worked on rebuilding an
abandoned funeral home for the
Prince of Peace Baptist Mission
Church to use as a sanctuary.
Among other tasks, the team
painted, replaced window panes,

fall break

and hung a door. Chaplain Rob
Spach says, “Our objective is to
provide religious programming for
the entire campus.” All students:
are invited and encouraged to par-
ticipate in service opportunities:
Back to the Grind

Now that the “hallowed Fall
Break has come and gone, many
students are asking themselves
where their time went. Why didn’t
they have time to catch up on their
homework? Why didn’t they have
time to read ahead in their texts?
Oh well. There’s still time for that.
Thanksgiving Break is only a few
short weeks away!

Humanities program receives professorship

Humes continued from page 1

The Humanities program is a
four-semester course for freshmen

_ and sophomores designed to fulfill
core requirements in History, Re-
ligion, Philosophy, and English.
Twenty-two professors from these
and other areas teach the course,

which alternates lecture and
disussion periods. Most professors
only teach one or two semesters of
the four semester series.
Davidson faced stiff competi-
tion before recieving this grant.
Only seven schools were selected
nationwide. Winners will receive

compensation that equals that of
other endowed professorships.

The first distinguished pro-
fessor will be selected in late Janu-
ary. Nominations may be submit-
ted to Robert Williams, Vice-Presi-
dent of Academic Affairs, in Cham-
bers 116 by December 1.
