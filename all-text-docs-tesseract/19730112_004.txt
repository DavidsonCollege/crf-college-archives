Pussyfooting

It’s about time the administration stopped
pussyfooting around and started plans for the garden
behind the Honors College. Time and time again
we've been promised the garden, but so far all we’ve
received is a bronze plaque dedicating it to some
alumnus.

It’s about time this administration started working
on things that are necessary around here rather than
fooling with such trite issues as subsidized football
and the funding of the library.

One of the problems holding up progress on the gar-
den has been the fight between the faculty and Vice
President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan over
whether to plant Zambidians or tubrous rooted
begonias around the Cohen statue. In a faculty meet-
ing yesterday, debate lasted three hours thrashing
out this question. A committee was formed to work
out the controversy. ;

Another blockage occurred over the necessity of
brick sidewalks thoughout the virgin land. College
President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. had ordered bricks
for a Serpentine wall around the garden, but Student
Body President Ralph Peeples protested saying it
smacked of elitism.

We hope that these important points will be worked
out as soon as possible. Davidson’s future hangs in the
balance.

Libertine Speaks

In the past several weeks, THE DAVIDSONIAN has
received several letters criticizing the editors and
staff of this paper of grossness, impudicity, ribaldry,
debauchery, lewdness, lasciviency, aprodisia, defile-
ment, immodesty, venery and poor spelling. Not only
that, but several have called the editor a loose fish, a
deceiver, a Bluebeard, a rake, a debauchee, a lecher
and a chartered libertine.

Well, it just ain’t so! And because it is not the
policy of this paper to print letters critcizing the con-

tents of THE DAVIDSONIAN, we take this space to.

respond to our critics.

Several people have complained that certain parts
of the paper are completely incomprehensible. We
deny the charge. One example often put forth was the
paragraph in fur last issue on the soccer petition. It
read: “‘The se of the petition according to Tour-
nee is, ‘to show support for soccer as a basketball’.”’
Now what could be more clear than that? We are
assuming of course that most people in this com-
munity do have an eighth grade education, though
several Republicans have caused us to doubt that
assumption.

Others have pointed to the example in our Novem-
ber 17, 1972 issue which read: ‘‘Comparing past teams
with this year’s team, Severn commented, ‘there is a
world . There is a great deal of spirit on the team’.”
Now surely no one will deny that there is indeed a
world

Still others point to the bi-weekly unintelligible
dwadle of some guy named Wopple. This is indeed a
weakness in ‘the paper, and applications are now
being accepted for new columnists. College admin-
istrators need not apply.

All in all we think many of our readers are being a
bit unfair. We’re just a bunch of college boys trying to
keep out of trouble.

And we really aren’t trying to be viscious in our
view of campus happenings. It’s just our en-
vironment. Davidson baffles science.

With an environment such as this, how do people ex-
pect us to put out a newspaper. We roll each week
from amazement to amazement to amazement. That
is why we consider this to be a very special week. It’s
one of the few in which news it contains is believeable.
To all our critics we apologize for any injustices of
which we are guilty. It just goes to show: Don't
believe everything you read in THE DAVIDSONIAN.

A Review

Every now and then there is a
Happening in the world of
music that makes rock and roll
worth all the day-to-day gar-
bage being released.

One such Event is the new un-
derground classic recently
released by Deity records. As
true cultists may remember,
Deity's first (and only) record
thus far was the legendary Mar-
sked-Marauders disk.

The band is made up of Donny
Osmond, Yoko Ono, Michael
Jackson, Mark Farner, Phil
Spector and Terry Knight. They
have a sound that approaches
the style of Three Dog Night,
but ‘manages to maintain a
funkiness the Doggies have
missed on their latest releases.
_Spector plays drums
(anybody remember the Teddy

Marijuana Smoking

Bears?) and Knight sticks to
bass. Together they provide a
solid support for Farner's
searing lead lines.

With the vocal freedom
provided by three lead singers,
“Turtle Mind” is able to cover a
wide range of styles in every
song. Often, Donny and Mike
weave interesting soprano har-
monies while Yoko screeches
away in the background.

The album opens with ‘‘My
Way", on which Donny does a
superb imitation of Frank
Sinatra, until the band really

gets cooking behind him. Then

Yoko comes in like either a
skyrocket or a wounded pig and
barrels the song into a tense
emotional climax.

The effect of the whole num-
ber is to leave you pressed
against your chair rubbing your
crotch in anquich. A real iove
song, that one.

Reporters Criticized

Tothe Editor:

I feel certain that my
colleagues will agree with me
that this ‘‘paper’’ is genuinely
offensive. Not only are the
editorials and articles idiotic,
but your standards of decency
and taste are revolting. Your
staff probably smokes
marijuana or LSD or ‘‘shoots
in’, as they say, while they put
out this trash. The only things
that save most issues are the
letters to the editor.

J.T. Kimbrough

To the Editor:
I read your paper regularly
and often wonder why.
Earl (the Pearl) MacCormac
Davidson College

To the Editor:

Why don't we ever hear about
the patriotic activities of the
Anti-Communists at Davidson?
From what I read about David-
son politics, there must be quite
a thriving throng of young men
and women who are proud to
stand up for what this country
is, means, and does to anybody.
It’s a good thing, too, because
the faculty is already infiltrated
as well as duped. (Especially a
certain pinkish economics
professor.) Incidentally, I was
sorry to read that a certain
beatnik ‘‘poet"’ who is a known
RED .and HOMOSEXUAL, as
most liberals are, read his
“works” at Davidson. Watch
out. They're all around us!

Who the hell is E. P. Thron-
ton, and who's a pinko?
E. F. Patterson
Davidson College

To the Editor:

We wish to make it known
that we, the English faculty of
Davidson College, had ab-
solutely nothing to do with in-
viting a certain beatnik ‘‘poet™
to speak here. Not one of us had
him into our class, nor did we
attend his readings. Fur-
thermore, none of us has read
any of his ‘‘works’’, and we
wouldn't like them anyway.

Surprisingly enough, with two
fine producers like Knight and
Spector, ali the production and
mixing is done by multi-
talented Canadian David
Clayton-Thomas. Clayton-Tho-
mas does an impressive job on
his first effort from behind the
big board, adding an air of non-
chalance that approaches slop-
piness tothe undertaking. .

The opening cut is followed by
a seven-minute rendition of
“Ben” Jackson starting his
touching lovesong in the usual
manner, but then Farner again
takes the iead line off towards
outer space, sounding at times
like he’s being eaten by the
damn rat.

The second side is a fifteen
minute jam on the title cut.
Yoko starts the song with 54high
pitched screams, but them Don-
nie and Mike chime in doing a
superb imitation of Captain
Beefheart. The band really
rocks on this. one, which in-
cludes a special guest ap
pearance by Duane Allman
somewhere on track 97, I think.

But all this comment would
be superfluous without some
mention of the showstopper: an
acapello rendition of ‘‘Deep
Purple” including all members
of the band.

I refuse to believe (despite
the liners stapled to the cover)
that Spector didn’t have a hand
in producing this one. For one,
it’s done entirely in mono. It
also includes a 500-voice choir
of kindergarten students.

It's gra&t to think that in a
world of supergroups and
superstars, a group of talented
people can still get together for

The English Faculty a recording of special merit.
Davidson College Thank God for Deity records.
