‘PLANS FOR YEAR (Study Conference

The Organized Reserve Corps at
Davidson has begun its program
for the year under the direction of
Prof. Crawford, a ieutenant-
colonel in the Organized Reserves.

Part of the 108th Infantry Di-
vision of Charlotte, the O.R.C. bet-
ter prepares the members to serve
as officers in the regular army.

At present time, all undergrad-
uate members at Davidson are also
enrolled in the senior ROTC pro-
gram.

Meeting each Wednesday night,
Lieut. Col. Crawford is assisted by
Co). Little of Lincoln Co., Major
Harris of Kannapolis, and Capt.
Ormsby of China Grove, all of
whom have seen service with the
regular army.

Membership in the O.R.C. has
one very distinct advantage: The
men enrolled will be eligible for
retirement from the Army one
year earlier for each year they
serve in the Organized Reserves.

Fraternity Pictures
Taken For Annual

The first fraternity pictures for
the annual were taken last night
in the College Union. The follow-
ing groups had their pictures
made: Phi Delta Theta, Beta Theta
Pi, S.A.E., Sigma Chi, A.T.O., and
Phi Gamma Delta. All other fra-
ternities will have their pictures
taken next Thursday, unless there
is a change of plans.

The Quips and Cranks staff ex-
presses its hope that each frater-
nity will cooperate to try to fa-
cilitate the making of these pic-
tures. This year group fraternity
pictures are being used instead of
individual pictures. The staff feels
that these group pictures will give
the annual a little more variety
than it has had in the past.

SMITH TAPPED BY N.C. GAMMA —D.DENT COUNCIL BEVAN, WORKMAN

EMPHASIZES AIMS

It has always been the policy

and uphold the honor system here
at Davidson; this is not its only
function, however.

Lyman Kiser, speaking for the
Council, said that he feels that all
student problems pertaining to
such things as noise in dormitory
and damage to school property
should be handled by the student
government Council.

He states that if all such prob-
lems can be handled satisfactorily,
the student-faculty relationship
would be earmarked by an increas-
ing congeniality in cooperation.
According to Kiser if this should
be the case, as the council hopes,
it could result in improvements
both on student and faculty levels.

Johnston Moderator

For Video

Dr. Frontis Johnston, chairman
of the History Department here
at Davidson, is currently acting as
moderator for a series of WBTV
television programs entitled “What
Matters Most.”

The program, which is broadcast
from 8:00 to 8:30 on Monday eve-
nings, is sponsored by the Char-
lotte Junior League.

Esch week a panel of prominent
citizens discusses pro-subjects re-
lated to the underlying theme of
the opportunities and responsi-
bilities.

Dr. Johnston graduated from Da-
vidson, and after earning his mas-
ter’s degree and doctorate returned
here in 1935 as a member of the
History Department. Dr. Johnston
is regarded as one of the out-
standing authorities on American
history in the South. Every fall
he delivers a series of lectures on
American history to the FBI in
Washington, D. C.

While a student at Davidson, Dr.
Johnston was a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta
Kappa. He was also outstanding
as a thember of the basketball
team and a tennis player. He grad-
uated with honors in the class of
1931. Dr. Johnston did all his grad-
uate work at Yale University, and
has been a member of the David-
son faculty continuously ever

| “Individual Responsibility.”

ATTEND MEETINGS

Dr. Bevan and Dr. Workman at-
tended conferences at Duke Uni-| :
versity and North Carolina State
College on October 23.

The main purpose of the trip
was to examine an aparatus which | -
Duke is granting to Davidson. Duke
recently enlarged her psychology
department, and the changes re-
sulted in a duplication of some
very valuable equipment. The
duplicated equipment which we].
are receiving will be in good shape | .
after reconditioning, according to
Dr. Bevan. Duke's grant to David-
son is in recognition of potential
research which the staff and stu
dents of psychology will do. It is
also in keeping with the idcal of
raising psychology standards in the
South — a goal of the Duke
psychology department. At the
present, most of Duke’s psychology
graduate students come from the
North, while their graduate depart-
ment is forced to turn away south-
ern applicants due to their lack
of preparation.

Dr. Workman and Dr. Bevan also
attended an executive committee
meeting of the North Carolina
Psychological Association in Ral-
eigh. Dr. Bevan, though not a
member of this committee, was in-
vited to sit in on the meeting.
