‘Ce,

Haul Down The SC Flags

Since this is the last issue of the year, and since
there will be no chance for letters to the editor, I
thought I'd do some spring cleaning around the sports
desk and throw out some ideas in the process.

i‘m not sure why it hasn’t reached North Carolina,
but up around Virginia there has been a lot of talk
about Davidson dropping out of the Southern Confer-
ence. No one seems to know where the rumors got
started, but it certainly has been “the topic” for sports
editors to discuss in their Sunday columns.

_ Take Bill Brill, the sports editor of the Roanoke
Times, for example. In a column recently Brill stated,
“Davidson might very well join WVU (West Virginia)
and Virginia Tech as an independent. If that happens,
and it’s a very good possibility, the Southern would be
in an awful mess.” He cited the arguments that ensued
during the Southern Conference spring meeting in
Asheville, when Lefty Driesell and Tom Scott proposed
a change in the number ‘of required basketball games
for eligibility in tournament play, as his evidence.

Driesell had proposed, after the departure of West
Virginia, that the number of required games be ‘re-
duced from 14 to seven. No one at the meeting was
very impressed by the motion. Some flatly refused.
Others politely said “no.” Someone suggested a com-
promise solution of ten required games. Lefty was
quoted as saying that he could survive with the ten
game requirement, but not with 14. The latter would
just Jimit Davidson’s ability to schedule top opponents.
So the fire was kindled.

What is going to happen if Davidson should de-
cide to drop out? How would it affect the Southern
Conference and the college?

Brill suggests that it would ruin the conference.
“For one thing,” he noted, “it (the conference) is com-
mitted to Charlotte for the basketball tournament, and
without Davidson, that critically important money-

producer would be a financial flop.” Good point. One.

must agree with Brill that “basketball in the Southern
needs Davidson,” especially. since the departure of
West Virginia.

Certainly Davidson’s basketball program would
expand if released from the clutch of the conference.
It is evident merely through examination of West Vir-
ginia’s 1968-69 basketball schedule. The Mountaineers,
freed from conference limits, have signed such teams
es national_char racuse, Florida, Mary-
land, St. John’s, Duke, and will play in the Rainbow
Classic in Honolulu. In the Rainbow tourney, they will
face such opponents as Arizona, Columbia, Purdue,
Sante Clara, and Stanford.

The remaining question is, “But what about the
other sports?” It is generally agreed that basketball
would improve. What about those other teams, and
those conference championships that give us such big
trophies?

| offer no substantiation for my claim, but I be-
lieve that these sports would be aided as well if we
hauled down the Southern Conference flags in the
gym and replaced them with the banners of fellow
independents. I'm in favor of breaking our bond with
the conference.

Our football team is improving, but it stands no
real chance for a conference title. It has proved that
it is capable of obtaining a good schedule outside of
the conference. We play Bucknell, Virginia, Connecti-
cut, Wofford and Vanderbilt next year. And we could

still play the conference teams as well. Certainly, as .

Brill and others have ‘suggested, other SC.teams have
“nothing to lose” by playing the Wildcats. Brill. sug-
gests that Davidson will be out of money for football
(claiming a $150 thousand loss this year) fairly soon
anyway, and will probably drop the sport.
We wouldn’t be able to take another golf or tennis
title, but with most of the Southern’s schools going
subsidized in these sports, we probably wouldn’t hold
the crowns for very long anyway. These teams don’t
play a large number of conference teams in their sea-
son now; the golfers played a number of ACC. teams
this year and the tennis boys have played a large non-
conference schedule.

The question is whether the benefits outweigh ‘the
disadvantages. I suggest that they don’t. I will make no
predictions, but I have a feeling that Davidson College
is approaching the end of its Southern Conference
days. And it might not be a bad idea.

Spring Cleaning

So much for the Southern Conference. . . I haven't
begun to clean out the sports desk,

We were hoping to have some further information
on Mike Maloy’s selection to the second team of the
Converse All-America ‘selections, but there have been
no official releases distributed.

Just as a matter of information for your calender
for next fall: the Davidson-Vanderbilt football game,
originally scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 23, has been
rescheduled for Friday evening, Nov. 22. It will be
played in Charlotte.

Coach Harry Fogleman, whose talent as an inter-
netional recruiter was affirmed this year by the ap-
pearance of George Berner and Alfonso Carillo in ten-
nis and soccer, apparently has another ace up his sleeve.
There will be another foreign addition to the tennis
team next spring, as a boy from Holland has arranged
to spend a year of study here. Not quite as talented as
Berner, he will probably play somewhere around the
number three position.

Tom Cox, who once punted a ball 71 yards for
Davidson, has signed a grid contract with the Dallas
Cowboys. Linebacker John Giles is talking over terms
with the Cowboys as well as NFL Champion Green Bay.

One final item: the clean-up resulted in the un-
covering of an anonymous contribution to the sports
page, signed merely by a mysterious organization, the
Committee for the Preservation of IMAC Softball as a
Spectator Sport. Entitled the IMACLOD “All-Turkey”
Softball Team (think about that title for a minute), the
article claimed to “recognize those individuals who,
though they may have been overlooked on the all-star
teams, have nonetheless contributed to make IMAC
softball the great spectator sport that it is.” ;

‘The members of the team submitted were Lindsey
Davis (SAE,) first base; Bill Funderburk (Independent),
second base; Chet Davidson (SAE), shortstop; Rusty
Brannon (Phi Gamms), third base; Mike O'Neill (Kappa
Sig), pitcher; John Huggins (Pi Kapp), catcher; and
David Hubbard (SAE), Charlie Goodykoontz (SAE),
and Tom Newberry (Phi Gamm) in the outfield.

That‘s 30...

Lyon Captures SC Crown,
Wins 220 In Record Time

Davidson claimed its first
Southern ‘Conference track
champion since 1965 last
weekend, when freshman
sprinter Rick Lyon captured
the conference 220 yard dash
‘at Ft. Eustis, Va.

Lyon's win was the first
for Davidson in a conference
meet since Alan Turner won
the 100 and 220 three years
ago.

Lyon sprinted the 220 in
record time of, 21.3, but the
officials disallowed the re-
cord because of an ‘aiding
wind.” The wind, according
to members of the team.
was not noticeable at the
time of the running.

Lyon's time eclipsed both
conference and school
marks. The old conference
time was 21.5 while the best
school time was 21.6.

He also equalled the best
conference time in the 100
yard dash with 9.7, but
finished third behind Wil-
liam and Mary's speed mer-
chant, Mike Fratkin, also a
freshman, who took the race
in 9.5, wind-aided time.

Although Lyon was the
only Wildcat to score in the
meet, which found Davidson
in last place, the team man-
aged to break several. school

right fielder found the going
rough in the last three
games of the season, but
finished at a .429 clip to
take the crown with ease.
He also led in number of
hits with 42.

Richmond's Bill Kennedy

with a .381 average, while.
Furman's Gary Laney fell

Knowles spent last week-

with the New Jersey team

after the weekend that he
would like “to hear some
European offers before mak-
ing any final choice.

He declined to say this
