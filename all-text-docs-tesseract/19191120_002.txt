Ga. Tech Administers U: ected
Defeat to Georgetown—Prince-
ton a Black Horse in
Contest With Yale

The Golden Tornado overwhelm-
ed the strong Georgetown team 27
to 0. The Georgia Tech team out-
played Georgetown in every de-
partment of the game and display-
ed the same dash and spirit that
has made her famous. The famous
Heisman shift discarded in the
Washington and Lee game, was
used to great advantage.

Virginia lost to Vanderbilt 10 to
6 as a result of a fumble, which
a Vandy guard recovered for a
touchdown.

Furman, our Thanksgiving rival,
defeated Erskine 41 to 0. Furman
as well as P. C., seems to be master
of the forward passing game. In
the game Saturday, however,
straight football was resorted to
mostly.

Coach Fetzer’s eleven defeated
the strong V. P. I. aggregation by
the close score of 3 to 0. Several
times during the. game the North
Carolina eleven threatened to score
and when the final whistle blew a
touchdown was in sight.

By comparative records it would
appear that N. C. State has a slight
advantage over Washington and
Lee. N.C. State defeated the Nor-
folk Naval Base 100 to 0, while
Washington and Lee’s count was
78 to 0. The N.C. State eleven on
a muddy field defeated Roanoke Col-
lege 78 to 0, while the Virginians
repeated the feat 32 to 0. N.C.
State defeated Davidson 36 to 6,
while Washington and Lee _ only

- won by a 7 to 0 count, though this
game was the Wildcats’ best of the
season. Both N. C. State and Wash-
ington and Lee defeated V. P. IL.
3 to 0.

Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania
battled to a 3 to 3 tie. ,

The. Princeton Tigers, contrary
to all expectations, defeated Yale 13
to 6. Scheerer, a Princeton substi-
tute, was the star of the game. In-
tercepting a forward pass when the
score was tied, he raced over the
goal line for a touchdown and a
Princeton victory. Sixty thousand

eople witnessed this game in the
ale Bowl. Harry Murrey’s broth-
er played an end for Princeton.

Union’station to meet.at the Y. M.
C. A. building after dinner.

Here the band formed promptly
at 2:30 and marched to Prince Al-
bert Field, followed by a crowd
that was characterized by the «le-

termination to give Carolin: the»

fight of her life.

At the athletic field, which was
destined to go down as the scene
of one of the fiercest battles in the
history of foothall; the supporters
of the Red and Black were joined
by a large number of former Da-
vidson men, all of whom showed

their loyalty by their support of |

times
were

all
odds

their alma mater at
whether or not the
against her.

At the end of the first half, just

to show that the Davidson spirit '

could not be downed even though
her opponents were in the lead, the
bleachers were emptied of David-
son men and the gridiron was made
the scene of the old snake dance,
which is popular at Davidson.

The amount of pep and interest
in the team has not been exceeded,
not even at Charlotte, where our
team was so nobly backed by our
sisters at Queens.

Class Basketball Waxes Warm

and Furious

Juniors ‘and Sophs Leading With
Clean Slate So Far

—

Juniors 35; Fresh 18.

The first game of the class bas-
ketball season opened with the Ju-
niors engaging the Freshmen in the
initial fray. When the final whis-
tle blew the upper classmen were
on the long end of a 35 to 18 score.
At the beginning of the first half
the Juniors jumped into the lead,
holding the Freshmen scoreless un-
til the last few minutes, when the
Freshmen shot two goals, ending
the half in a 20 to 4 score in favor
of the Juniots. The second half
opened with plenty of “pep,” the
Freshmen being determined to cut
down their opponens’ lead. The
Freshmen’s team work was excel-
lent in this period, the Juniors
making one more point than the
“Fresh” in this half.

Brice and Ormond starred for the
Juniors, while Brake tossed in most
of the Freshmen’s baskets.

That the Wildcats would not lack
for support was plainly evident
when on Saturday morning several
members of the faculty, half of the
student body, and Colonel Mueller’s
band boarded the Davidson Speciat
for Winston-Salem.

Arriving in the Twin-City of
Forsyth county at 1:30 o’clock, the
boys who were standing behind the
Red and Black machine at the

ed their rivals and caged three bas-
kets in the first few minutes of play
but the Sophs recovered themselves
and when the half ended they were
on the long end of a 20 to 10 score.
The Seniors came back strong in
the second half and reduced their
opponents’ lead to two baskets, but
the Sophomores again recovered
their former stride and by pretty
team work piled up a score which
the Seniors could not overtake. The
game was clean and fast, not a per-
sonal or technical foul being called.
Doubles and Roberts played the
stellar game for the Sophs, while

Askew and Hawkins played the
best game for the Seniors.

Sophs 33; Fresh 10.

The Sophs, after defeating the
Seniors on last Wednesday, contin-
ued the good work by winning
from the Fresh _-the next day with
‘a score of 33 to 10.
_ The game started off very quietly
and with only a few spectators. At
times there was some good scrap-
ping done and the game was very
interesting when both teams got in-

;to it. The Sophs did some pretty’

passing, but as yet the Fresh are
lacking in team work. Manager
Crawford has plenty of men to pick
from and. it is rather hard for him
to get his best team picked. He
‘will no doubt round his team in
‘better shape before the season is
over.

Doubles was the individual star
;of the game, playing a good floor
game and also shooting accurately.
Houghton played a good game for
the Fresh. Line-up:

Juniors 40; Seniors 18.

The Juniors scored their second
victory by winning from the Se-
niors with a score of 40 to 18.
Neither team started off: with a
great deal of pep, but soon the Ju-
niors got together and began cag-
ing baskets in quick succession.
seemed that the Seniors were try-
ing to get one every time the Ju-
niors got two, but when the final
whistle was blown and the_sgdre

was given out, .he Seniors Wéte in
need of one more goal.
The Seniors have found ~ two

jmore players since their first game,
and both of them had a chance to
show their ability in this game.
The shooting of Hawkins was spec-
tacular for the Seniors. Orman at
forward and King at guard played
a good game for the Juniors. So
far the Juniors have won two
games and the Seniors have lost the
‘same number. Line-up:
