“From my own experience there
is nothing on earth that business
needs so much today as religion.”“—
O. M. Fisher, President, Boston
Boot and Shoe Club.

“The religion of the community
is really “the bulwark of business
and of our, investments.

“The underpaid preachers of the
nation are the men upon whom we
are depending, rather than on
well-paid bankers, lawyers, and
5 brokers.”"—-Roger W. Babson, the
& Statistician.

2a E 42a; and Siberia during the recent great war.
1 i - The general topic discussed was,

“How, in this time of flux and variation,
can a man who has strong religious con-
victions hold to them and still be toler-
ant and fair to the other fellow who has
different views?” Mr. Hoffman em-
phasized strongly the fact that the
aflairs of the world are today practically
in a muddle, and that the outcome is to
be determined by the actions of the
thinking men of the hour. The man
who believes that there is a God who is
omnipotent, that God is good, who de-
sires to do His will, and who believes
that the universe has a purposeful end—
this man has a good working basis, and
{will come out right if he thinks deeply
,and clearly. The men of today need to
consider the facts of history, and to take
a broad, historical point of view in re-
gard to all the great questions that
,come up before them.

One of the great dangers of the time
is that there exists a tendency to fol-
low blindly the leadership of others,
however ignorant and unworthy they
may be, without each man’s thinking
matters over carefully for himself. Much
of the present unrest iscaused by hatred
and suspicion, and the great need is for
Truth, for Men who will think clearly
and fairly, and who are Christians at

THE COMMISSARY |PRESIDENT OF Y. M.C. A.

SPEAKS TO VOLUNTEERS

Lewis Schenck, the “Y" president,
spoke to 50 volunteers and their friends
last Wednesday night on the “Value of
_Decision.” In his talk Schenck showed
how important it is to make a decision
and to stick to it. He also showed how
‘decision gave one power not only to
isolve his own problems, but also to lead
‘and help others in overcoming their dif-
ficulties.

Following Schenck, Ed Cunningham
read an interesting letter from Rev. R.
D. Bedinger, who has just returned to
his work at Lusambo, Africa. Mr. Bed-
inger will be remembered by many as
one of the principal speakers at the
Student Volunteer Conference held here
last spring.

The Deputation Committee reported
that the following men will be sent out
next week:

W. E. Crane and E. L. Hollingsworth
to Monroe, N. C.

John Parks and Ted Jones to Paw

Student Volunteers ate, drank, and made
merry with their friends to an extent
that the entire gymnasium (and also
several of the fellows afterward) rocked
and groaned in agonized protest. +

Promptly at 10 o'clock, or indeed con-
siderably before ten, 78 husky college
boys, carefully selected and in the pink
of condition, gathered in the Y. M.C. A.
‘roonts. When bidden, at last, to “go
up,” they obeyed at once, and with all
that calmness and solemnity which is
customary on such occasions, the little
' company filed slowly past St. Peter and
into the inviting portal.

A grim Scotch silence of some 15 or
20 minutes followed, broken only by the
popping of dope bottles and by the
steady tramping of moving feet, journey-
ing ceaselessly from one table to an-
other. At last, however, even these
noises subsided as the men one by one
sank into seats in Various corners of the
room, gazing at the bare tables with ex-
ptessions of contentment and satisfac-
tion which can come only from a sense
of duty well performed.

Making the statement that “If there's
anything we Volunteers’ believe in, its
fun,” Price now broke up the peaceful
scene by demonstrating just how fully
the Volunteers do propose to enjoy their
surroundings and their associates. Two
of the unsuspecting visitors, Bavid Mc-
Alpine and Goliath Long were forced to
engage in mortal combat, with pillows,
and to make the struggle still! more
deadly, and defense even more difficult,
both were blindfolded. Six other blind-
folded men were asked to feed each oth-
er Hollingsworth and White being
especially commendabte for the affec-
tionate attitudes they assumed.

The call for jokes was nobly met by
Bobby Long and Davidson, who made
Pat Miller take off his coat. Major Mc-
Caskill immediately clamored for the
floor, but the president wisely called on
Dr Arbuckle who expressed great sur-
prise and pleasure at the number of stu-
dents present, saying that they evidently
knew a good thing when they saw it.
He went on to tell of the great things
which would be possible if the students
would yield themselves to God’s guid-
ance, telling of a rough engineer who
was converted and became one of our
greatest ministers.

Other speakers disttfised spiritual
development and the work of the band.
Chalmers emphasized the great possibil-
ities of the absolutely consecrated life,
saying that there was enough power in
the 70 men present to shake the world.

Parks told of the great convention at
Trinity saying that it had helped him
volunteer. The president, Price, then
closed the program, extending a cordial
invitation to all who were at all inter-
ested in missions to attend the regular
band meetings on Wednesday evenings.

“Y” ANNOUNCES UNUSU-.
ALLY GOOD PROGRAM

Easter Sunday the evening “Y” service
will be turned over to the District Chris-
tian Endeavor Convention which con-
venes here at that time. The convention
will have distinguished speakers to lead
this meeting and an exceptionally fine
program is assured.

Sunday week, April 3d, the “Y” will
have as speakers a deputation from Co-
lumbia Seminary. No further word
need be said about these speakers, for
the words “Columbia Seminary” alone
carry enough recommendation to make
every one desirous of hearing them. Dr.
Thornton Whaling, whom many remem-
ber from his speeches of former years, is
president of the Columbia Seminary.
The deputation will bring the seminary
quartet with them and a fine treat is in
store for all lovers of music.

Mr. R. S. Templeton, 78 years old, of
Mooresville, N. C., father of Mrs. L. R.
Brady, passed away at his home Sunday

o’clock Tuesday a. m., at Mooresville.
