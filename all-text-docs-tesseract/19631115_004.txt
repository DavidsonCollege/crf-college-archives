Davidson’s accro@itation. “We
will discover, I hope, the areas
of our school which are weakest
and need improvement,” he
Stated. “We should also find
ways to further strengthen even
our strongest points.”

The study, as scheduled,
will take two years. Work be-
gan this September after Dean
Frontis Johnston and Or.
Pietenpol attended a briefing
session in Atlanta conducted
by the Southern Association

The first phase of the study

As part of the second phase,

Karly Decision Plan Fills
Fifty Places For Next Year

BY BILL NORFLEET

More than 50 members of the
class of 1968 were chosen on the
early decision plan this year,
according to H. Edmunds Wthie,
associate director of admissions.

This represents a 30 per cent
increase over last year’s quota.
There were 60 per cent more
applicants for early admissions
this vear than last. White said.

Perennial Plights
Plague Freshmen

“After eleven o'clock, study
on the freshman halls is almost
‘jmpossible,” averred Brooks
Sheldon at the Freshman Coun-
cil meeting Tuesday night. “At
the first of the year, the Phi
and Eu halls were left open for
studying purposes, but now they
are closed. I'd like to see some
rooms in Chambers left open
for study areas.”

Discussion of these problems
will be taken up with Dean Rich-
ard C. Burts, but many other
suggestions were made by the
council members in an open
suggestion period. David Me-
Corkle, freshman cheerleader,
proposed that the council be-
come active in supporting fresh-
man athletics.

Other suggestions included
asking for water fountains on
the third floor of freshman
dorms and freshman programs
in the “Open End” discussions
on Wednesday nights.

Meeting times have now been
set up for alternate Wednes-
days at chapel period. By a ma-
jority vote. four unexcuséd ab-
sences will bring automatic dis-
missal from the group.

Suggestions were also enter-
tained on raising money to as-
sist the Richardson Scholars in
attending various cultural acti-
vities. Sheldon was selected to
consult the YMCA to determine
needs and suggestions for this
program.

At a special meeting held last
Friday, John Loughridge was
elected social chairman. In this
capacity he will serve as a mem-
ber of the Union Board, and will
coordinate all freshman social
activities. Loughridge is a native
of Lafayette Hill, Pa. and is a

pledge of Phi Delta Theta.

_On the increase in applicants,
White commented, “There is
the feeling now that if a man
has made a definite choice for
Davidson College and is reason-
ably well qualified, it is a serv-
Jee both to him and to us to get
it over with.” He also noted
that there were more applicants
of age 17 this year than last
due to the post-war baby boom.

Figures for applications of the
past two years show 85 appli-
sants for early acceptance in
1961 and 79 in 1962. This year
there were 133, the admissions
office reported.

The increase came in spite of
an application deadline pushed
back two weeks to Oct. 15. This
was done to coordinate David-
son's deadline with that of other
institutions in order to simplify
the task of students and secon-
-dary school guidance counselors.

Notification of acceptance
were made Nov. 1. In 1961, 45
were accepted by early decision;
in 1962, 36 were accepted.

SALUTE: BURL RAINWATER

When Burl Rainwater (B.A., 1958) reported to Southern
Bell in 1961, he coordinated the Bell System Census Project
in Tennessee. Working out his own guidelines for collect-
ing data, Burl analyzed his results to forecast household
growth during the Sixties for each telephone exchange

in Tennessee.

Success on this assignment earned him a new one where
he also had to pioneer. When told to study the possible
application of teaching machines to telephone training, he
and another employee programmed an entire basic elec-

tricity course to show what the new devices will do.
The textbook the two men developed for the machines was
later copyrighted and published.

With such achievements behind him. Burl is now carry-
ing out other interesting assignments in the Knoxville Com-

mercial Office.

Bur] Rainwater. like many young men, is impatient to
make things happen for his company and himself. There -
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
