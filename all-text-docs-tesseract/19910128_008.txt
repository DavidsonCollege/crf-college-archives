THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

Depth, Relevance!

A Self-Righteous Interlude

I’ ve been feeling a bit apoplec-
tically apathetic this week. So to
celebrate I decided to produce a
little piece of absolute verbal drivel
-- sort of the linguistic equivalent
of a drool string stretching flacidly

David
"Shelob" Scott

between mesmerized lip and con-
templative navel. And I don’t feel
guilty at all.

The following message con-
tinues solidly in the tradition of
such Davidsonian standards as “In
Good Health” and “The Incredible
Ease of Well Being.” Self help
literature is all the rage. We’ll call
this week’s installment “Wake Up
You Ninnies.”

I am convinced that the curse
of the youthful intelligentsia of
today (that’d be us) will not be a
harried life burdened with existen-
ual angstand a gut-wrenching mid-
life crisis to break the monotony.
We have progressed beyond such
trite mid-twentieth century mal-
adies. Angst is passé and life crises
seem to come and go nicely by the
age of nineteen.

No, the vile shadow stalking
the overeducated fortysomething’ s
of the twenty-first century will not
be Camus’ ghost but something
much more sinister -- a hideous
and undiscriminating plague of
scoliosis brought on by too many
years of single strapping.

For the clueless, scoliosis is
the discomfitting physical condi-
tion in which the spine hangs a left
when it should have gone straight.
Bummer.

Furthermore, contrary to the
apparent conception of the
Davidson community, scoliosis is

not dead! Ferretted out for decades
by fanatical elementary school
examiners, it simply lies fallow,
wailing to spring. We, smart-fel-
low-young-people, stand on the
verge of unwittingly regenerating
this perfidious pillager of posture.

Backpacks have, like, two
straps folks. Has. this fact ever
spoken to you? I know, I know. Of
course it hasn’t, because you, dear

Civilization came crashing down
on my forearm.

The twenty five pound bike
followed in turn, and I was toast.
Flat on my back and humiliated,
you’d think I’d a’ learned. But no.
Ire-tethered my sagging upperarm
and continued flaunting my own
bumbling self.

At long last my good friend
and mentor Clay Adams set me

rate.

The unused strap on your
JANSPORT is nota safety device
with which to strangle muggers on
your late night walks home from
the Library. It works just like the
other one. If you poke your little
arm through the loop it will settle
with surprising ease upon your
erstwhile vacant limb.

The slidey little adjustment
doohicky should look strangly
familiar to you. (Again, just like
the other one.) If it hasn’t rusted
into an immotile death grip, you
might want to set ita little bit loose
to account for atrophy in your
shoulder muscles do to lack of use.
Ittakes time to get that old strength
back.

Live a little, srap ‘em up!
Respect for the functional capabil-
ity of your backpack will increase
exponentially. The designers never
actually meant for your shoulder
to feel shredded by demon fingers
after three classes, the post office
and a lab.

Act now while you’re still
young and limber. Your spine may
yet have time to straighten out,
thus sparing you the sudden mid-
life realization that you have be-
come, The Horror, irretrievably
kinked.

I myself once grovelled in the
realm of the singly strapped.

One time freshman year I tried
riding my bike with about 43
pounds of Humanities hanging
from my left shoulder. Finally, toe
clips in place, precarious balance
established, I commenced. One
pedal stroke, two, weight shift, and

__ really care about David Scott's beard,” or "There are problems in
the world" or "People are inherently evil" or "God is inherently
good” or "Gosh, we're all just kind dust in the wind if you think
about it” or whatever, and then write these thoughts in a letter and
send them to The Davidsonian office before Friday or contact

straight. He said, “Dave, you’re
stupid. Put on the other strap.”

Hesitantly, I obeyed, and Oh!
the saintly Bliss! Aching shoul-
ders sang paises to my name, and
my spine -- poor, forgotten spine -
- slowly began to rise out of the
base cleff it had become.

Friends, the choice is yours.
Equilibrium lies just around the
comer. Slip on that shunted strap
and feel the wonder of a fully
operational di-loopated mono-
hatch canvas carry-all.

Sure, you might get called
“Double Strapper.” People are
cruel. But if you really think about
it, worse epithets have been hurled.

After a moment of trepidation

-you will notice the exquisite pleas-

ure that walking down the haul can
become. Drop your pencil? No
problem. The dipartate maneuvera-
bility of a double strapped pack is
unmatched. Either side, any direc-
tion, just stoop right on down there
and pick that sucker up!

Pretty soon you start to feel
like a freed soul among slavish
bipeds shackled hopelessly by one
clavicle to a tome weighted ball
and chain.

And consider the scenario if
we fail to act now:

The year is 2016. Davidson
graduates, for the most part vic-
tims of voluminous years of gradu-
ate study and the subsequently toted
tonnage of single-strapped-books,
have become a national fixation.
An article appears in Time:

“The Davidson Phenomenon:
S-Shaped intellectuals Struggle
On, Live Life At A 45° Angle To
Reality.”

The choice is yours. So long.

I would love the opportunity to
expand my activities to the Union
Board. I think I would prove to be
an enthusiastic and responsible
president for the whole student
body, andI would appreciate your
vote in next Tuesday’s election.

various positions, and giving it
back to the Union Board, and
ultimately the student body, in
the form of enjoyable and effec-
tive programming. The President
and the Board should be a visible
group, able to interact with the
students for ideas and feedback.
My experiences have allowed me
to see where the Union has come
from and where it could go. The
Publicity Committee has taught
me the importance of making the
campus aware of what the Union
has to offer. It is also essential
that the Union cooperate with and
compliment each house on the
Court. The Union is moving in
exciting directions; keep that
experienced energy going by
giving me the opportunity to work
for you as Union President.

committee, International commit-
tee and other Union Board mem-
bers including the Social Board. I
have assisted this year’s Social

| V.P. with the, planning of two

“big weekends,” homecoming and
mid-winters. I feel that I have as
complete an understanding as any
student of how the Union oper-
ates and what makes Union pro-
grams a success.

While the Union has held
many successful events that were

‘| co-sponsored by the houses on

Patterson Court (such as Lunar
Luau and Blues Traveler), the
Union also presents an alterna-
tive to the “Court scene.” I enjoy
Court parties, but it is important
that there is a viable social alter-
native on campus to playing sar-
dines on weekends, Not only is it
important, though, that these al-
ternatives exist, but it is critical
that the campus know about the
events in the Union as well.
Concerts, study breaks, movies,
FAC’s, lectures, etc. may be mar-
velously planned, but all to waste

if students do not come to enjoy -

them. My plan, if elected, is to
continue the great events spon-
sored in the Union, offer a little
more variety in order to attract
more people, and PUBLICIZE.
Don’t forget to vote on January
29th.

vital role it plays on the cam-
pus. As a Chairman of both the
Pop Films committee and the
Alumni Speakers Committee, I. -
have a great deal of experience

, with how the Union board op-

erates behind the scenes. I am
deeply interested in what events
the Union plans and sponsors
as well as the image it has on
campus. I care about this posi-
tion enough that I wouldn’t do
just enough to “get by”; I want
to do the best job possible.
My experiences while liv-
ing in London last semester
enable me to bring freshness to
this office that would be re-
flected in a new perspective
and new ideas. Furthermore, as
we begin to make the transition
from the present building to the
new facility in the’ former
Johnson Gym, it is essential to
elect leaders who know the Un-
ion’s past and yet have a clear
vision about what could be ac-
compliushed in the future. My
knowledge about the way things
have been doneand my dreams
for the year to come would
fgulfill this need. As you vote
of January 29, remember me,

away with, or altering a few tra-
ditions.

With the R., which stands
for REINFORCEMENT, I will
try to strengthen the amount of
student participation through
weekly events that are not cur-
rently in effect on campus.

The A. stands for ATTI-
TUDE. Atthe presenttime, many —
mémbers of the student body do
not feel the need or the desire to
participate in Union activities, It
is my intent to arouse their de-

sire to participate,

The other C. stands for
CREATIVITY. Without it, I
would never have come up with
this speech, and with it, I intend
to broaden the range on the.type
of activities that are planned on
campus (ie a street fair, jazz band
for homecoming, as opposed to
ususal semi-formal, etc.)

Finally, the K. stands for
KALEIDOSCOPE. By incorpo-
rating the ideas of other people
around me, with those of my
own, together, you and I can

-Make. the.office of Vice-Presi-

dent social, more than just a
position, but the key to “an ex-
citing life on campus.”

So come on, and get into
C.R.A.C.K., so that we can all
help get Davidson on a“high”,a
high ladder that is, to success as
a school with great academics, -
and a touch of fun.
