LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Five

Letters Lay Bare Multiplex Opinions

Milord,

It pleases me forsooth to en-
deavor to explicate a seeming
contradiction: namely, that
that which is, is not, which isto
say that he that was may have
been, but is not, not any more,
or will be any more.

His rantings, ravings, rum-
blings and mumblings (num-
bingly ) have gotten the best of
him, or rather allowed the
worst posthaste postnight to
expurge the dark, to wit,
Davoidson.

Behold! My light is
darkness, My mercy wrath;
Alan Baragona is _ gone,
drowned in my dust, blinded
by eternal day in night, thirst
unquenched by My never-
flowing fount. He is gone, gone
into My grasp, as you all go,
going, gone: No more.

I remain King,

To the Editor:

I would like to call all you
Wildcat’s attention (Sorry, not
you Wildkittens, as we shall
see as the story flows on) to a
magnificent Davidson
tradition.

A seemingly trivial oc-
curance, it offers vast insight
into our lives and situations,
as do so many other “in-
significant’’ phenomena
which surround, and yet
escape, our awareness.

I speak of nothing other than
the center wash-basin in the
gentleman’s room in our
hallowed library, which
displays a leaking faucet
which I have never, in my four
years vigil, seen ceased.

Neither a steady trickle nor
a torrent, this drip-drip-drip-
drip has, over the eons, eroded
the porcelain from the sink
which receives its bounty.

The eminent philosopher
Miles Ward was heard to ex-
claim upon his perception of
the shrine, ‘‘everything drips
on like this faucet.’’ And so it
does.

To the Editor:

I was encouraged last week
to read Lynn Dean’s account
of ventures into the wild. It
was only recently that I
myself made a few steps into
the unknown.

My first adventure came on
the Honors Center Rocky-
Ridge picnic. We all drank
spring water, and there were
cows in the vicinity.

Even scarier was the fact
that we couldn’t wash our
hands

This winter I’m living on the

Rocky River near Bush Fork
(i.e. Fork You) with an old
mountain man, Rocky Hennis.
He sure does like his ham!
Once I was walking home
and stepped on a baby mole.
Within seconds his mother
was atme , and you know how
vicious mama moles can get.
The only way I could
was by running wiggle-ways. I
out smarted her!

At this time, I am con-
structing a science. It is a new

To the Editor:

I would like to point out that
Alonzo M. Cohen, noted
Paraguayan Linguist is not in-
cluded in this lampoon
anywhere. I feel that this is an
injustice and a slap in the
spirit of lampoons past. It is
also a affront to God, a being
almost as close to Mr. Cohen
as to me. In the words of that
noted philosopher : ‘‘Mxon Kit-
sme caoktoama Bill Roland.”’

To the Editor:

Once again, the SPE’s have
pricked the outrage of the
social system connoisseur.
They have once again rushed
past the most enjoyable
phase: the time between the
first penetration of the fresh-
men into the social system and
the final climax of ejection
from Slater into their
brotherhood.

Those of us who realize the
fun can only shake our heads
in sorrow.

FACULTY GUEST COLUMN

Professor Amazed
By Uncanny Wit

By ALEXANDER J. MCKELWAY
Professor of Religion

I will not write down my thoughts just yet, but will let them
flow from my soul in sublime order, expressing my brilliance,
my unsurpassed intellect, my uncanny wit, (I could go on), with
literary magnificance, in that clear prose style reverberating
with obscure allusions.

I will give you counsel; my advice is sound but you find it
inaudible. Oh my pseudo-students, innocuous saps, why do I
waste my time casting my pearls in your pig sty?

But no, I must not think of that right now. I will write some
trivial words, sage advice, a faculty guest column of which you
may be able to understand half, only after I have allowed my
thoughts to run their course.

I shall take a moment from my busy schedule, (though it be
only a moment, it is far more valuable than the hours of other
men), and bask in delight as my stream of consciousness widens
into rivers of heavy water, seas of ideas, oceans of well-
developed conceits.

Oh, the estrangement I feel, not being able to express myself
in simplistic style so that you students, arrogant students who
consider yourself sufficiently literate to read THE DAVID-
SONIAN, which you pompously proclaim a “literary
publication,” might understand in part the complexity of
thought which fills my being.

But before I write, I will sit here at my cluttered desk with my
feet propped up on piles of inane term papers, stroking my
goatee, puffing tobacco, filling the air with aromatic candor,
trying to overcome that impenetrable wall which separates me
from my students, brilliance from ignorance, shit from fans, the
quick from the dead.

My thought is so eloquent, so complex, even I am amazed by
my profundity. No shit.

Oh you dim-witted, scum of the earth. Students. You have
caused me to ramble in my thoughts. But you shall never know;
I certainly do not ramble in my lectures. No, I softly woo you in
my classroom ; you sit stunned by my superiority, you slumber
in turbid discomfort, unable to grasp the message I proclaim.

But I will fill you with frenzied fear on the day of my review. I
will leave you alone in the classroom to duplicate the little, the
infinitesimal; that meager portion of my knowledge which has
somehow penetrated your dense skulls in spite of yourselves.
Yes, I will leave you alone; you will be frightened not to have me
there. You will come whimpering to kneel at my feet, beg me to
return to the classroom where you sit alone.

You are lonely because you realize you have no thought of
your own. You come to me as empty vessels, and I fill you with
my wisdom, something you can get your teeth into, something
which will fill the cavities of your mind witth much more
precious material than the gold which fills the cavities of your
teeth.

You wonder why admissions to Davidson is so tough. You ask
with that innocent, stupid gaze of awe why you must have shown
such great character and personality in high school.

The answer is simple. So we can deny it all; deny that you

exist, realize that you do not reach personhood until you
graduate.
t have I done? Oh wretch that I am, you students have so
polluted my mind with your inane dribble that I just committed
the ultimate insult to myself. I posed a hypothetical question
from a student, and then I answered it. Students don’t deserve
answers.

I never answer your questions in class. You ask ‘‘Why?” and I
tell you: Because students don’t deserve answers. I manage to
avoid them always. Oh no! I did it again. I swear never again to
pose a hypothetical question from a student and answer it. In-
deed, I will never answer a student's question. What would Karl
Barth say?

I discourage questions. I prohibit discussion. You are here to
hear my lectures. If you did outside study, you would realize my
lectures aren’t worth the 50 minutes you could spend the study. I
thrive because you do not study. I suppress the ones of you who

do

You dolts: you students,
