OUR REPRESENTATIVES.

Word inas just come to us that our
Debating ‘Team has triumphed over the
strong team trom: Emory College. — I
was expected, of course—we always ex
pect our teams to win when there is even
a fairechance for success—but it seems
especially good to the men on the campus
here, who have known of the adds
against which these men, Price and
Smith, have been working. We have
known of the intangible question, which
was thought to be almost undebatable
(and tor which a substitute question was
refused by. Eimery), of the impossibility
of getting material for the debate, ot
the sickness, at ore tine, of both of the
debaters, of the vast amount of outside
work which fas been carried by both
men, especially Price. When we con
sider all these things, and) possibly we
could continue to name them, Howe had
been defeated, we then begin to realize
the heroic efforts which have been neces
sary to bring victory to Davidsun, ‘lo
say that we are thoroughiy proud of
these men, is to express our sentiments
in terms of extreme mildness,

But when we realize atso, that this
victory is only one of many during the
last rwo weeks, it is brought clearly and
forcefully to us, the work which our rep
resentatives are doing dor the College.
No student will soon forget the day in
Rock Hill last week, when practically
the entire student bedy accompanied: the
teams, and where we won the debate
from Clemson and the game from Wol-
ford. “Phe debaters, Rowan and Alex-
ander, handled the extremely — difficult
questions relative to the Literacy ‘Test
in amanner which left ae doubt in the
minds of any in the audience that. the
decision should be in favor of Davidson.
Countless hours were spent in the prep
aration for possible points to be uncever-
ed by the opponents, and with the clear
and logical reasoning of one and the fire
and energy of the other, tempered by
facts and forensic skill, there was never
atime when we did not feel that David-
son's reputation would be — sustained
And this, too, against a college three
times our size.

In athletic fields we have done cqually
as well. During the last two wecks
Davidson has won from Elon by an
overwhelming score. from Wofford, on
foreign grounds, from the Charlotte
league teain in a hard fought contest,
from Richmond College. by a good
score, and now today comes a report of
another ‘victory from Wofford in their
own territory. It has been, with hardly
a pause, one victory piled high upon an-
other. ; .

And now in checking up and getting
a balance. we find where our representa:
tives, in athletic and literary fields, have
worked hard, and trained well, and sac-

for the glory ot the College. And al-
thought defeat would have meant noth-
ing, knowing they had done their best,
yet it is good to be able to give the tav-|
orable resules, which bring out in bold
relict, the way in which all those who!
represent us, have nobly acquitted them-
selves and brought victory and honor tu |
