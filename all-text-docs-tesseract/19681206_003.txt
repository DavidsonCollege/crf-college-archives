Higher Ranking Means Two More Pages Of Rules

4

_ While the students were away for the Thanks
giving break, we stayed and won our first game with
VMI. Besides our first victory we also were issued
rules to live by in the form of three mimeographed
sheets carefully stapled together.

Under the fitles of “Dress and Behavior Rules,”
“Bench Behavior,” and “Training Rules,” each page
enumerated with considerable detail the difference
between right and wrong. Last year we only received
one printed sheet of rules. | guess being ranked
fourth merits two more pages this year.

The first page under “Dress and Behavior Rules”
has 16 items listed. Keeping our hair cut and. neat,
and going to the barber shop at least once every two
weeks should certainly heyp the Davidson community
economy. Shaving daily is also another rule, but if the
team wants to, we all can grow beards and mustaches
with the only condition being that we all look alike.
Still, Lefty is safe, since some of us would come out
looking like Abraham Lincoln while others couldn't
get much more than a little “peach fuzz” around their
chins.

Item number three states that we are to “Dress
neatly and wear socks and clean clothes at all times.”
Coupled with item 14 which states that we are to “dry
our hair well before going out in cold weather, and

class. 1 wonder when the sex education classes are?
Item number four and 16 should make the ad-
ministration and faculty happy. “Attend all required
assemblies, chapels, ete.” and number 16, “Do your
best in class daily. Always observe Honor Code,” re-
mind us of school, classes, and other trivial things.
Page two has to do with “Bench Behavior,” some-
thing pertinent in my present position. If you saw the
last game you probably noticed how the bench was
cheering and even the BRB (back-row-boys) were en-

Wildcats Lose Two Reserves;
Snipes And Spann Quit Squad

By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Writer

In the 1968-69 Davidson
basketball booklet under the
caption ‘‘Lefty On Snipes”
one reads that ‘Snipes will
definitely play a lot of bas-
ketball this year and could
push for a starting job.”

Under ‘‘Lefty On Spann”
it says that “Spann could be
a strong bench man this
year."

Ricky Snipes and Mike
Spann, however, will not be
tendering their talents in
service of the basketball
team this year. They have.
dropped off the squad.

that much to this thing.”

“Coach Dreisell and 1

nounced that Spann was plan
ning to quit so.that he could
concentrate on his golfing
game. “Of course I'll be able
to play more now, but that
really wasn't the reason I
quit."" Spann was an All.
American in golf last year.
Although each said that
certain ‘“‘personal. reasons”
had encouraged his decision.
both agreed that there ‘‘are
no hard feelings at all."
“I'm sorry that Snipes and

he said.

Originally, it had been an

season," coach Lefty Dreisell
said, ‘“‘but they have made
their decisions. We could
have used them.”

“We quit for completely
different reasons.’ Snipes
explained. “I've decided to
play collegiate football in-
stead of basketball.”

Snipes, an All-State and

South Carolina while in high
school, is “thinking about
playing football at another
school and transfering from
Davidson after the first term.
Football is my best sport,
anyway.”

team we had this year I
wouldn't be playing much
this season. So, being a sen-

According to Spann, he

scholarship. ‘It is my under.
standing that all I had to do
to earn it this year was to go
out for the team. I did, so-I ;

And it shouldn't be too
hard for the 6-7, 215-pound
sophomore to obtain a foot-
ball scholarship, after receiv-
ing around 140 offers just
two years ago.

For the freshmen squad
last year Snipes averaged
18.4 points a game while
finishing second on the team
in rebounds and scoring.

Whereas Snipes will prob-
ably lose his basketball
scholarship for quitting,
Spann, a senior, apparently
will be allowed to keep his.

“I quit mainly because I
wouldn't ha otten to play
much this year,."’ Spann ex-

"Cats Prep
For Tough
Vanderbilt

Last year’s schedule is a
thing of the past, but Coach
Lefty Drieseil and the Wild-
cats are not forgetting one
game.

Last year in Nashville the
Vanderbilt Commodores rode
the sharpshooting of Tom
Hagan and a couple of con-
troversial referees’ decisions
to an overtime victory over
the team.

Tomorrow night, Coach
Roy Skinner brings Hagan
and the rest of the Vandy
team to Charlotte for a long-
awaited rematch. After two
wins, Davidson is ready.

All- American candidate
Hagan is joined by juniors
Bob Bundy and Perry Wal-
lace and Sophomores Thorpe
Weber and Rudy Thacker.
The team makes its second
appearance of the season to-
morrow, having inched by
SMU in its opener earlier in
the week.

The Wildcats, paced by the
scoring of Mike Maloy. Doug
Cook and Jerry Kroll, have
rolled to victories over VMI,
92-72, and Furman, 105-70.

Playmaker captain Dave
Moser will join them, and
either Wayne Huckel or
Mike O'Neill will fill the fifth
spot. If Huckel gets the call,
the starting five will be the
team which has never lost
as a starting team.

thusiastic. This is because of items number one and
nine which state, “At time outs, entire squad listen,
five men in game sit on bench, others gather around.”
and ‘The bench should be our most avid cheerleaders.”
The bench is also more important this year due to item
three which states, “When seven seconds left in close
game or half. entire bench will stand up and count
down.” At least the subs will learn to count backwards
before the year’s out. ;

Item four states that all subs are to run on court
and hand the player whom he is replacing his warmup
jacket, and that man is to run off the court. “Run” is
underlinéd and if with all the running, a player gets
tired, he reverts to item five which says he is to tell
Lefty by pointing to himself which results in his being
taken out of the game. Item seven is the consequence
of item five in that it states, ‘‘Man coming out of game
sits next to Coach Driesell.”’ There seems to be no rule
for fhe procedure to get into the game but I’m working
on it.

The last page has to do with training rules. Be-
sides the evident rules of no drinking or smoking,
ancther rule is that there is to be no dating the night
before a game. | believe Lefty sees women as evil in
regard to his players and at times | tend to agree with

him. In any case he certainly doesn’t want any of his
