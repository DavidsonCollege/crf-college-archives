Chalmers G. Davidson, equipped
with an A.B. from Davidson, a
master’s degree in library science
from the University of Chicago, a
doctor's degree in history from
Harvard, and an earnest desire to
keep “Phi Bet Hall” properly use-
ful to the Davidson students, has|
been Director of the Library with
a faculty status since 1936.

He is assisted by a professional
staff, who with the aid of about
twenty student workers handles
the circulation, the cataloguing,
and the ordering. Miss. Virginia
Lawson, Miss Della Shore, and Mrs
Paul Marrotte are the staff mem

One of the Library’s most out-
standing fe: is that of allow-

mitted to enter the stacks at will,
eliminating the inconvenience in-
curred by allowing only library
workers in the stacks. This prac

ies, unusual student privilege.

There is a fraternity on the cam-

At the latter point Dan can often
be induced to throw away his in-
hibitions and do the “rubberlegs,”
between the
mambo and beach boogie. All who
have seen it are sure that he could
only have learned it in the twen-

Of D.C. Intellectual

The Eumanean Literary Society,
met in extraordinary session Mon-
day night, December 5, to hear
three prominent Davidson faculty
members discuss the general topic,
“The role of the intellectual on the
Davidson campus.” The three fac-
ulty members participating were
Professors Johnston, McAfee, and
Purcell. Each delivered an infor-
mal statement of his particular po-
sition in regard to the matter, and
then the floor was opened for dis-
cussion and questions.

There was general agreement
among those participating in the
symposium that the plight of the
intellectual, on or off the Davidson
campus, is to be deplored. It was
pointed out throughout the eve-
ning that there is little sympathy
shown to the student who is active-
ly engaged in an ardent pursuit of
knowledge for its own ends on this
campus.

“To be caught working in the
library or engaging in conversation
with a faculty member is often
thought to be high treason in
many circles,” as one symposium
member expressed, “and it is this
climate of opinion which must be
changed before Davidson can. be
considered to be a first rate
school.” It was also suggested that
Davidson students are the pro-
duct of a too comfortable, if not
too smug, environment, and that
as long as there is complete se-
curity, creative, initiative is some-
what limited.

The lack of ability and the lack
‘of interest shown by the members

made it necessary for them to defer

the Phi challenge until later when

brary was painted.

Ten years ago the library’s bud-
get for new books was two thou-
sand dollars. Today it is ten thou-
sand dollars, a figure which com-
pares well with schools of our type
in the South. This money is used
in part for new books and in part
to buy better printed and better
edited copies of books already in
the library.

Perhaps the greatest problem be-
fore the library today is that of
future remodeling and expansion.
This is a question in line with the
fate of Davidson itself, that is
whether the College will admit
more students to meet the increas-
ing number of college applicants or
retain the present status. In eith-
er event, at the present rate of
book increase, new stacks will be
necessary in about five years.

Debate, Musical Reading, And Poetry

Debate, musical readings, and
poetic inspiration formed center
of action at Philanthropic Literary
Society during its last two meet-
ings.

At the third meeting of the So-
ciety, November 21, a resolution
on the Intercollegian was debated.

A motion was immediately made
and passed to the effect that the
General Secretary of the Y. M. C.
A. should be mailed a copy of this
resolution. After a long and rather
warm debate during which the
publication in question was care-
fully examined, the resolution was
passed by a two-thirds majority of
the members present.

Following the debate the mem-
bers enjoyed an exceptionally fine
program of selected readings from
Stephen Vincent Benet’s “John
Brown’s Body.” Harry Antrim,
John Trask, Bob Majors, and Bill

repeatedly, should go into humor,
simply because there is infinitely
more money there, than in serious

with which we certainly can not
take issue, since he himself is a
consummate example of its truth.
