In the day's most outstanding
performance, Keith Fraser took
the high jump with a jump of
6’ %". This jump smashed both
the existing Relay's record and
the school record.
The other new mark set at the
Relays was set in the sprint
medley relay by the W&L team,
composed of Pearson, Kell, Hick-
ey, and Essex with a time of
3.37, bettering the old mark by
more than 2 seconds.

The freshmen golfers, al-

The ‘Kittens have tied a match
