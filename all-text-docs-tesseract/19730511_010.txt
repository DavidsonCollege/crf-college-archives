one. Now. if,the Senate was
speaking ot abolishing the foot-
ball program altogether. then
their idea makes quite a bit
more sense.

Football cannot compete suc-
cessfully in the
NCAA with the money they get
now. There is no reservoir of
money to inerease the tootball
budget. It thus seems that the
aboiition of the gridiron clashes
is the only sotution

But wait There seems to be
another way to inanreuver the
tinancial aspects. so thal (oot

Seems easy. doesn tit

With a ihitue proper
management of funds in this
program, the basketball team
has the money to recruit and
compete successtully on the
NCAA level.

With the ‘surplus’ of 140
grand. the college can begin a
distribution of these tunds to the
direly needed areas. namely

Perhaps. though. a non-
subsidized program would be
somewhal less expensive than
a subsidized one. It has been
estimated that a non-subsidized
program would save the school
only $15-20.000 per vear.
However. Vice President for
Finance and Development C.
David Cornell has a study un-
derway to look at the schools
playing this type of tootball.
which wall give the coliege a
pretty sound estimate of the
costs of a  non-subsidized
prograni.

Whether or not these tigures
atl be released to the pubdiie is
unknown Bul tt makes pretty
good sense lo wait until some
survey is completed betore any
action is taken on tootbail.
unless i 1 completely
aboltshed as a tinancially sup
ported sport by the trustees ot
the college

Thus. tt seems the most el-
ticient and economical move
would be to place the basketball
team on the level of an auxiliary
enterprise. Holland feels that
this must be done now. if it is to
be done effectively.

Whereas this would not solve
the college's athletic financing
problems, 1t would ease the
pressure on most of the sports
which need money quickly and
keep football in existence until a
completely rational decision

.can be made

that some considerations could

before a decision can be made
official. It does not seem to be
bending the standards unfairly
to allow an athlete to be signed
and admitted early. if he meets
the academic requirements.

This is an important point in
any athletic program. If
recruiting cannot be done et-
fectively, then a team will not
be able to compete on the level
with other schools.

There is no sense in a
prospect signing a grant in aid
with Davidson onlv to be rejec-
ted later because he would lose
all chances of gainimg a grant
with any other school. It seems
the admissions commiltee
eould make some. decision.
early. it the case warranted 1
tor a student or an athlete.

Make no mistake about n.
This does not by anv means,
call tor the lowering ol
academic standards tor
athletes. What it does say is that
Davidson should either give
sports the support and leeway
that they need. or drop them all
together.

It does not seem that the lat-
ter alternative is the one which

would benefit the school the
most. Athletics play an im-
portant part in the make-up and
function of a college.

It makes sense that Davidson
should take the immediate
course of action necessary to
provide these sports with the
support they need as_ they
charge into the crucial stage of
their battle in todav’s crisis in
athletics.
