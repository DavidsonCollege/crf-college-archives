Von Unwerth Defends

The controversy over fraternities, which was ignited in assembly talks Monday

and Tuesday, flamed to a blaze before a crowd of 300, mostly students, in an Open

End discussion Wednesday night in the Morrison Room.

Protagonists Bob Young,
former fraternity liason  offi-
cer. and Rick von Unwerth,
president of the IFC, led the
three-hour discussion.

Alex Bernhardt opened the
questions by asking Young ex-
actly what the administration,

IFC Head Proposes Solutions

As Robert C. Young,
member of the Administra-
tion, alumnus, and former
fraternity man of Davidson
College, spoke in assembly
Monday, he issued a chal-
lenge to the students, and
especially to the fraternity

members: “I challenge you
to define again, and to find
again, the idea of fraternit

and its place on the David-

son campus today.”
In doing so, he gave two

concrete proposals for the re-
organization of the fraternity

Administrator Strikes
At Fraternity System

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

IFC President Rick Von
Unworth, in chapel Tues-
day presented to the stud-
ent body the views of the
IFC on proposed fraternity
system changes, and his
personal comment on a talk
given by Bob Young the

day before.
Agreeing with Young that

fraternity association in some
cases tends to mold a member's
character and to knock off the
“rough edges’ of some of its
brothers, von Unwerth asked if
perhaps such a character as
is molded by this association

“by its nature . . actually
seeks a mold.”
As to the “rough edges”

which the fraternity may tend
to smooth off. he contended
that those rough edges are bet-
ter gone if they keep the in-
dividual from entering fully in-
to a world of ‘‘social security”
which will extend far beyond
the confines of his own par-
ticular fraternity.

Recounting the evils in the
present system stated the previ-
ous day by Young, von Un-
werth found that four major
points had been brought up.
First of all, there is the ‘“im-
mediate confrontation of the
freshman with a magnified so-
cial concern” and the haste for
a decision which he is not
ready to make. True. this does
sometimes result in mistakes
by both freshmen and fraterni-
ties, but ‘‘is it not possible that
a Strong freshman can measur-
ably invigorate a weak fratern-
ity,” and vice versa?

FROSH SOCIAL LIFE

Another point brought up
against sophomore bidding is
that a freshman’s social life
under such a system would be
almost nil. This social aspect
may seem superficial to some,
but after all, aren’t the frater-
Nities specifically designed as
social fraternities? And do
they not provide almost the en-

tire social life of the college—!

a social life which the college
itself so completely neglects?

As to the criticism of pledge
programs taking too much of
the. pledge’s time in meaning-
less activity — this may have
been true at one time but not
any more. Now the average
pledge program provides a sys-|
tem whereby the pledge has a
big-brother to help him, tutor- |
jal service. compulsory study
hall, and social projects on
which he is required to work.
If these are bad for the pledge
and if they are a waste of his!
time, he must be a truly re-
markable rtudent, the IFC pres-
ident maintained.

Concerning the tendency of aj
fraternity pledge to become too
closely associated with his rer |
lows, to the exclusion of others,

von Unwerth pointed out that a
pledge's close association with
the “BMOC’ in his. fraternity is
a means of opening his eyes to
the possibilities of extra-curric-
ular activities at Davidson Col-
lege, and these “BMOCs"' can
serve as ready-made guides
and advisors for thhim as he
strives to follow their example.
LOCALS NEEDED

Lastly, the so-called ‘“‘rejec-
tion” of 27% of the student body
is now as pronounced as it is
because of the hack of social
resources which the independ-
ent finds open to him. This
could be somewhat lessened by
the formation of one or two eat-
ing clubs or “locals” which
would offer the independent ad-
vantages which Lingle Manor is
now not able to provide. von
Unwerth proposed.

This brings us to the con-
clusion that ‘‘the main trauma
in being rejected by the fra-

ternities is largely the realiza-.

tion that the independent has no
resources for social life." But
is this entirely the fault of the
fraternities? They have, by
merely existing, accepted re-

sponsibility for 73% of the
school's social life.
The college, however, has

made no move to aid the other
27%. Does it not seem that this
is also a problem of the college
which now shows itself to be so
concerned? And further, does
it not “seem that to the great-
est concern belongs. the greatest
responsibility? And that con-
cern belongs to the college.”

system: 1) Sophomore Rush,
and 2) 100% bidding. |

Four benefits of the Sopho-
more Rush proposition, accord-
ing to Young, are that it will
enable the freshman to become
settled before he is forced to
make a decision. It will pro-
vide time for the, freshman to
engage in extracurricular acti-
vities. It will lessen the ten-
sion of having to make a de-
cision on one week's experience
with fraternity members. The
fraternities will be able to re-
evaluate their own position on
campus in regard to life at
Davidson. ’

The advantage in the 100%
bidding system is that it will en-
able the rushees to choose for
themselves the fraternity they
wish to join, rather than being
accepted or rejected on the
basis of one week.

According to Young, there
has been much concern over the
position of fraternities both na-
tionally and on the Davidson
campus. This has been foster-
ed. he said, by the indication
that ‘fraternities are interest-
ed in something entirely differ-
ent from what they say they
are.”

Though they say that they are
interested in the individual,
they bid only those whom they
think -best fill the mold of
the fraternity. Also, once he
has pledged, the individuality
of the freshman is categoriz-
ed as “rough edges” by the
brothers. and these edges are
‘destroyed during Pledge Train-
ing.”

Another evil of the present
system, Young pointed out. is
the terrible hurt placed upon
the rushee who is rejected.
When he arrives at Davidson.
the [reshman is told ‘by every-
one he meets that ‘‘the College
is concerned for his welfare as
an individual.’ Then as Pledge
Saturday approaches, there aris-
es the possibility that he may be
rejected — ‘‘not just ignored
and subtly ostracized, but offi-
cially and resoundingly rejected

by 73% of the student body.
Young declared that fraterni-
ties under the present system
have no place on the Davidson
campus. Fraternity men, he
said. are able to view and ar-
gue objectively the aspects of
the Campus Community, but are
totally without reason when the
question of fraternities arises.
This is their ‘sacred cow”
which cannot be blasphemed.

In an environment channelled
to the learning process and to
the maturing of the mind, stat-
ed Young, the picture of the
Davidson fraternity man under
the present system is certainly
incongruous. What kind of ma-

turity. he asked, is expressed-

by “the most emotional kind of
catharsis," such as. with ‘‘tear-
filled eyes” shaking the hand
and welcoming the new Pledge
on Pledge Saturday, or sadly
stepping into the street to wish
“Good Luck” to the rushee who
is passing by the house.

And what kind of maturity is
shown by such emotional activi-
ties as cult-like “hymns. testi-
monials, ritual, personality heal-
ings, tears, and orgiastic rites
on selected Saturday nights.”

Rev. J. B. Evans
To Speak Sunday

This week’s vesper speaker
will be the Rev. John B. Evans,
Executive Secretary of the Di-
vision of Higher Education of
the Board of Christian Educa-
tion of the Presbyterian Church,

Rev. Evans. who is an alum
nus of Davidson, received his

cent’’ into the laps of the fra-
ternities, plans to do to help.
He stated that the fraternities
are willing to be of any help
they can, but questioned the
administration's willingness.

In answer, Young said that
maybe “today the fraternities
do express a willingness to help,
but before Jast week such a
willingness was doubtful” and
if this question is allowed to
slide. tomorrow such a willing-
ness will once again have dis-
appeared. He stated that last
spring the IFC ¢urned down
Lingle Manor’s request that the
group be permitted to extend
Manor bids through the IFC's
“brown envelope’’ to those boys
who got no other bids.

At'this point von Unwerth in-
terrupted to state that the IFC
andthe Lingle Manor represen-
tative had agreed not to follow
the above proposal, because it
might be regarded as a slap in
In the face to the boys receiv-
ing no other bids. They did.
however, agree to allow Lingle
Manor to participate in the
pledge regatta, homecoming and
other projects.

INCENTIVE HURT

Agreeing with this, Young re-
minded von Unwerth that al~
though Lingle Manor would pay
for part of the regatta, they

would be allowed no trophy Common is the fact that they | rites

should they win. ‘‘This,"’ he in-
sisted. ‘‘eats away at the soul
of Lingle Manor.” Such a poli-
ey of only partial participation
represents a “stifling of suc-
cess of any independent organ-
ization on campus.”

Von Unwerth, setting aside
the re-statement by Bernhardt
of his question as to the plans
of the college to aid the ‘27 per
cent,” urged a move to less
specific questions. such as the
problem of 100% bidding.

Answering this, Bobby Waites
asked Young what was to pre-
vent the collapse of certain fra-
ternities which were required
to take members which their
constitutions forbade by reason
of race or religion. To this
Young simply answered, ‘‘Noth-
ing at all, and in such cases the
loss is slight.” if not beneficial
to the student body as a whole.

Bob Jones, assistant dean of
students, next asked von Un-
werth if he (von Unwerth) felt
that there was ‘'a social stig-
ma put on boys not aceepted
in any fraternity.’ and if so,
did he feel that the fraternities
were responsible. Von Unwerth
replied that he did feel there
was some stigma attached, but
that the fraternities were re-

sponsible only in that, were
there no fraternities, there
would be no stigma.

IFC Secretary Fred Sackett
here pointed out that the idea
af a stigma is attached not only
to those boys who joined no
fraternity. but also to the par-
ticular fraternity joined, in
some cases.

Young then asked if the
choice of joining a fraternity
or being independent was real-
ly a choice at all or merely an
alternative. To this Sackett
cited numerous men on _ the
campus who have the respect
of the entire student body. Such
men as these could, in the fu-
ture. lead to the establishment
and maintenance of the propos-
ed eating clubs, he maintained.

Charlie Dibble here counter-
ed by pointing to the small
number of independents who
have joined Lingle Manor.
“Therefore,” he asked. “why
should these men in the future
support any other type of in-
dependent organization even
though it could provide such
advantages as a more complete

social program and eating at
the house. which Lingle Manor

cannot provide? After

NUMBER NINE

JAZZ GROUP TOMORROW

IFC Weekend Starts
With Dance Tonight)

The Herbie Mann Sextet will

highlight the IFC fall concert
weekend at 8 p. m. Saturday
night.

The Sextet is an apt repre-
sentative of the jazz under-
current that is coming to the
forfront o' his American musi-
cal preference. Mann and his
five instrumental colleagues are
equally at home in the dimly
lit, electric atmosphere of night
clubs and the unaffected en-
thusiastic reception of college
audiences.

Mann, .the official leader of
the group, is an artful compos-
er in his own right. His per.
sonal thrust into creative jazz
has consisted of uncovering
basic folk rhythms in such areas
as Africa and South America
and infusing these with the
characteristic jazz strains native
to America. The f{ruits of his
labor bear such titles as ‘“De-
safinado” and “Girl crom Ipan-
ema.”

The Herbie Mann Sextet will
present jin its concert selected

the ‘27 per cent: are not neces-| pieces from Mann's personal col-
sarily compatible — the only|lection of original endeavor as
thing many of them have in| well as numerous familiar favo-

are not in a fraternity.”

the fraternity by weakening
the ability of the fraternity to
maintain itself. He said that
blanket bidding may cause the
fraternities to change in some
ways, but that they would not
die. The college, realizing their
social usefulness, would not al-
low them to.

Here Dr. John Kelton brought
forth the idea that the goals of
‘the college and the fraternities
were to provide opportunities
for contact with diverse ele-
ments of the student body, to
provide opportunities for the de-
velopment of personal skills,
and to divide the freshman
class into 12 groups where
pledge training would be a sort
of ‘‘after-orientation.”

SOCIAL OUTLETS

This John Barnhardt count-
ered with the assumption that
a fraternity’s main purpose was’
not necessarily to increase aca-
demic stimulation, but to pro-
vide an outlet for the student's
social side, provided that this
did not hinder his academic pro-
gress.

Another fundamental question
was raised by Andy Little in
asking “exactly what is so im-
portant about national affilia-
tion of the fraternities?” The
faculty, in the person of Dr. W.
G. Workman, came to the de-
fense of national fraternities in
pointing out that an important
aid to the college in controlling
the fraternities .was the nation-
al organization, which could
punish the fraternities more
easily and thoroughly than
could the administration.

After three hours of discus.
sion, which towards the end be-
came less and less general, both
Young and von Unwerth decid-
ed that the problem had been
presented fully to the students
and that enough opinions had
been expressed to give the IFC
and the administration a good
idea of the problems and opin-
ions involved a basis on

percussionist complete with
robe and spirited beat accom-
paniment.

The appearance of Mann on
the stage of IFC concerts is a
new innovation. Rick von Un-
werth, president of the IFC, has
earlier stated that this week's
concert represents a conscious
effort to bring to Davidson
something different from the

eyed, doom - forecasting folk
singers," which the college com-
munity has been saturated with
of late.

The Saturday night program
will climax a weekend of varied
entertainment. On the preced-
ing Friday night from 7:30 un-
til 11:30 there will be a dance,
sponsored cooperatively by
the College Union and the IFC,
in the basement of. Chambers
Building. Music will be provid-
ed by the ‘‘Catalinas.’’ Again,
this is a novel feature of the
current IFC season, for previ-
ously the council has been able
to provide only three two-night
weekends. On Saturday after-
noon at 2, the Davidson foot-
ball team will vie to better its
25 record as the Wildcats
meet Lafayettte College.

Council Postpones

Taking Sta

Student Council voted to take
a stand on the faculty oath issue
Monday night but deferred for-
mulating the stand until next
spring, nearer the time when
the Trustees will vote on the
ratification of those amend-
ments to the oath which. were
outlined at their meeting last
month.

Deferment of the stand was
proposed and accepted on the
consideration that the council's
position might be more clearly
formulated after the issue had
developed more fully.

Most. of the representatives
felt that it was the duty of the
Student Council to take such a
stand. Only three of the twelve
present voted against the plan.

One member said he knew
of a number of faculty members
who had said that they would
feel compelled to leave the col-
lege if the oath issue were not
resolved to their liking. It was
pointed out that such action as
this would have a definite ef-
fect on the academic commu-
nity. ;

In other business, the council
voted down a proposal to grant

Davidson’s receiving a full re-
port from the Queens delegation
on this organization. The pro
posal was voted down on the
grounds that Davidson would
‘likely receive such a report with
or without. the grant.

The report is desired because
the Davidson student body has
expressed dissatisfaction of the
National Student Association's
political stand, whereas the As-
sociated Student Governments
is non-political. The possibilities
of affiliating wth the latter fs
being considered by the Stu-
dent Council.

The council also decided that
Davidson's delegation to the re-
gional NSA convention at Duke
should be chosen by next week
in order that the delegates
might be instructed as to the
stand the school wishes to take
when a new constitution is
drawn up at this meeting.

During the course of the meet-
ing the problem concerning
lack of study space was dis-
cussed. The possibility of open-
ing the library for a longer
period in the evenings was
mentioned, along with a sug-
gestion that the lower halves
of the literary society halls
might be used. It was pointed
out, however, that when too
many extra places for study
were opened, the dorms would
become noisier.

Thanks was given to Andy
Little for his work on the Stu-
dent Council reading list. Little
said that this list had cost the
Council ninety-five dollars.

Twelve of the fourteen re-
presentatives were present at
this meeting.
