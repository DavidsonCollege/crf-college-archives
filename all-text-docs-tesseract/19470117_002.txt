Davidsonian ? ??

“The time has come,” the walrus. said,
“to talk of many things ....’ This weeks
editorial columns could contain thought on
many subjects that seem to be of import-
ance to Davidson students today, and there
Was some amount of difficulty envolved in
making a selection for this weeks edition.
The subject which we are choosing is one of
eoncern, even alarm, for it is about a
Davidson which seems to be slipping in
some of its tinest traditions. In particular
do we point to the publication which you
are now reading, 7he Davidsonian.

The question up for discussion is sim-
ply this. Do we want a weeky publication
on the Davidson campus? Apparently not
With a student body of nine-hundred and
three students, the paper goes to press
tonight with five men present. Five men
to do re-write, proof reading, make-up,
lay out,, typing, and all the other tasks
tied in with the job of putting out a col-
lege weekly. Frosh and Sophomore re-
porters who are assigned stories often fail
to report at all, and when they da manage
to bring in a literary masterpiece of
twenty-eight lines, they toss it on the
desk, and with numerous feeble excuses,
leave the office. Headlines are written by
the managing editors, this a traditional
underclass job. Junior and Senior staff
members are not exempt from blame, how-
ever, Several of the managing editors
‘whose jobs are making up the paper, and
proof reading the copy, have spent less
than three nights with the staff this year.
These are the men that you as Davidson
students will vote on in spring elections
for editor of the newspaper. Yet members
of this student body criticize us for our
paper, and wonder why-tr the past year
and one half the Davidsonian has slipped

from het usual First Class and All Ameri-]

ran Ratings to that of Second Class. The
students are expected to make the David-
sonian their newspaper. Ifyou have an
opinion on something, express it in a let-
ter to the editor. If you want to writé an
editorial or a feature story, write it. Re-
member, this is your school and your news-
paper. The college and the paper will be
only what you) as individuals make it.

1, our maker and protector, Who
hast graciously sent us into this world to
work out our own salvation, enable us to
drive-troni us all such inquiet and perplex-
ine’ thoughts as may mislead or hinder us,
in the practice of those duties which Thou
hast required. When we behold the works
ot Thy hands, and consider the course of
Thy providence, give us grace always to
remember that Thy thoughts are not our
thoughts, nor Thy way our ways. And
while it shall please Thee to continue us
in this world where much is to be done,
and so little is known, teach us by Thy
Holy Spirit to withdraw our minds from
unprofitable and dangereus inquiries, from
difficulties vainly curious, and doubts im-
possible to be solved. Let us refoice in the
light which Thou hast imparted. Let us
serve Thee, O God, with active zeal and
humble confidence, and wait with patient
expectation for the time in which the soul
which Thou receivest shall be satisfied
with knowledge. Grant this, O Lord, for
the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.”

Amen.

Quarter System...
During the recent Christmas holiday
period. Davidson men could be spotted at

every happy gathering by their long faces

and haggard expressions, while other
young men who were at home from

neighboring institutions were light heart-
ed and gay. Reason? At the end of the
holiday festivities for a Davidson student
lies that horrible abyss of final semester
examinations. He knows that when he
returns to the campus he must prepare for
the long ten day siege of horror which

cutions withthe quarter system send their
students home with exams safely tucked
away and a new start in the making on re-
turn. Why does Davidson linger on with
the outmoded semester system? The only
argument which we have ever heard in
favor of the practice is that the rate of
retention is higher when classes do not fall
on consecutive days. This evidence cannot
be too strong, however, for other institu-
tions of higher education would not have
adopted the quarter plan had this been the
case.

With the many veterans planning to con-
tinue their studies throughout the year, the
quarter-system- certainly seems more con-
venient and ‘plausible — the summer

student opinion on the issue. I feel certain

After numerous delays, postpone-
ments, putting-offs, and other pro-
crastinations the campus attempt
at yellowish-purple journalism is
at last regaining its normal course.
The cause of said deferments were,
I ashamedly yet necessarily admit,
because of the of this
hunk of newspaper non-
sense. I feel it is my duty to in-
form the reading (if such
there be) of the cause of all these
delays and incidentally the cause
of the disappearance till now of
my Christmas present to the faith-
ful weekly flounder
through the confines of this article.

The obséfvant will have
noticed by now the addition of some-
thing new to the cut that heads
this column, an addition which, I
have little doubt, has been eagerly
awaited, though extremely long in
coming, To these brave and hardy
souls I raise my glass (of milk, for
the benefit of the faculty and ad-
ministration) in salute for being
able to withstand such a_ terrific
blow, IT must add here, however, to
soothe my own savage pride that
if one works up to it easily, he will
soon become accustomed to my
countenance (ask my two room-
mates), This then was the present
which I had in mind for my read-
ers and which has only now arrived.
The tardiness of arrival has a long
and sordid story behind it which
I feel bound to relate at this time
so that The Davidsonian will not

A lengthy session was held among
the members of the staff when it
was learned that yours truly had
succeeded to the privilege of putting
forth drivel every
week for the benefit and enlighten-
ment of the Davidson student body.
for with this honor came _ the
secondary privilege of a cut and
picture over the-column,—The cut
was not disputed by the €dif6rs. but
the later article was held as being
derogatory to Davidson standards
and traditions and to the motto of
the paper which is “For A Better
Davidson.” Eventually it was de-
cided to go ahead with an experi-

miscellaneous

tested on a committee composed of
a representative group of students,
namely the editors.

After receiving my instructions,
I set off to Charlotte one bright
day to search for a strong-willed
photographer with great intestinal
fortitude and a burning desire to
accumulate the shekels, Hours of
search finally rewarded my efforts.
and I was cloistered in a small
studio with a man almost twice as
big as myself, I took my seat as he
directed and waited while he ad-
justed his camera, His head dis-
appeared beneath the folds of his
hood and did not reappear. I
began to fidgit and finally inquired
of the man as to the source of
delay. I was answered by a low
groan and an almost inaudible re-

quest to leave. As I picked my
way out, gingerly avoiding the
bits of broken lens, I heard the

huge man slump to the floor.

It was another week before I re-
turned to my trials of seeking out
a hardy picture-maker, but a small
studio far off the beaten path
volunteered to attempt the ordeal,
The entire staff of three partners

staked their collective and indi-
vidual reputations on the job with
collective and individual shudders.
They were successful, however,

since one of them survived to print
the picture. He afterwards inforin-
ed me that a great deal of chemical
solution was required to develop
the picture because it easily con-
sumed the potency of a standard
amount.

But now I had my cut, and I
proudly presented it to the com-
mittee.This was a few days before
Christmas holidays began, so I must
apologize for being the cause of
the spoiling of Yuletide cheer for
my associates on the staff. The
editors have still not completely
recovered from severe cases of
shock and stomach trouble, especial-
ly our revered Edward C. (Trout-
head) Sutton who has nevertheless
managed to drag himself from his
sickbed to edit this week’s paper.
This apology may explain the many
delays and possibly.the sub-stand-
ard content of this edition.

The committee decided in’ fayor
of allowing the picture to go in,
however, on the grounds that it
was as good as could be expected
and they would thus make the
writer of this piece known to all,

was passed down on the shoulders

During the past several weeks
most of the ‘boys have been busy
catching up on sleep lost during
the holidays and recuperating from
the activities thereof in general. In
fact, Brother Frank Lemmon had
such a rough time of it that he
had to honor Memorial Hospital

with his presence there. White
Brother George Gunn worries about
what girl to invite to the Mid-
Winters (so that somebody else
can pin her up,) Brother Up-
church and Pledge-brother Scruggs
have other arrangements upon
which to expand their mental ef-
forts. A finé Feed was indulged in
as a farewell to sleep during the
exam period last Sunday. Besides
the traditional Beta Brew and con-
comitants, there was a_ special
feature in the form of a dedicated
song to Pledge-brother McNair’s
wife. A highlight was the election
of Miss Barbara Coith (one of
Brother Pittman’s. “main objects
of life’) to the sponsorship of Phi
Alpha for this years annual. The
new sponsor is from Orlando,
Florida, and is a student at Rollins
College. She is undoubtedly the
