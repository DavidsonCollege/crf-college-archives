Mountain Swarm, ateam of former
college standouts.

The Wildcats, playing with-
out several key players, were led
by Carolyn Kirsch who tallied 12
points and4 rebounds. Katy Kamp,
playing her first ever collegiate
game, also scored 12. Jennifer
Sanborn added 10. °

The Wildcats will take on Ft.
Bragg in their second exhibition
game on Sunday at 4:30. They
open their regular season at Army
on Nov. 21.

Kerry and Jamie Brown both
missed Saturday’s exhibition with
a stress fracture and severely
sprained ankle, respectively. also
out of action due to shin splints but

is expected to return to practice on
Wednesday.

Jen Sanborn played but is bat-
tling tendenitis, Jennie
Vanlerberghe has a slightly pulled
hamstring, and Monica Winter has
suffered a concussion.

Last year the women’s bas-
ketball team managed to break
records even while battling inju-
ries.

“We never ever played a single
game when everyone was 100 per-
cent healthy,” said coach John Fi-
lar.

This year’s team is talented,
but according to Filar, the key will
be to keep his players healthy.

“Health is a big concern.
That’s going to be the key,” Filar
explained. “We have to be able to
put all our weapons on the court at
the same time. If we’re healthy,
there’s not a team on our schedule
we can’t play with.”

Crew earns respect

By JosLyYN OGDEN
Staff Writer

When Josh Peklo and Jay
Hinton met on the 1993 Odyssey,
they never imagined that one day
they would be leading the Davidson
Crew team to one of the most pres-
tigious regattas in the United States:
The Head of the Chattahoochee.
The race is the largest in the South-
east and the third largest in the
nation. 5

Four years ago, Davidson had
no rowing team. Hinton and Peklo
had to borrow equipment from
other schools, and they struggled
to convince other athletes that the
5:30 a.m. practices were reward-
ing. But with Hinton coaching and
Peklo acting as president, the team
has made great strides.

“Sure, it was really frustrating
at first, the college had basically no

equipment nor a strong rowing tra-

dition, but our hard work paid off

and we have made it to the pin-
nacle of the sport,” Peklo said. :

On Saturday, November 2, the
Wildcats stood in Roswell, Ga., on
the shore of the Chattahoochee
River, cheering on the four boats
that competed in the regatta.

The girl’s varsity team placed
in the top half of their event defeat-
ing Clemson, Florida, Rice, among
others.

’ The men’s varsity did equally
well.

“This race was truly the high-
light of the season. I have never
coxed sucha good race,” coxswain
Ellen Rockwell:commented after
the men’s race.

The two novice boats also
defeated many schools including
Vanderbilt, Sewanee, Rice, and
Furman.

Rugby squeaks
past Elon

By CLAYTON SCHLOSS
Staff Writer

The Davidson rugby team
traveled to Elon College last Sat-
urday and pulled out a 10-5 vic-
tory. It was a low scoring affair,
unlike the Wildcats’ last few con-
tests, and defense was the key.

Davidson jumped out to an
early 5-0 lead when flanker Thayer
Long scooped upa loose ball, broke
away from the pack, and pushed
the ball across the line for a try.
Elon evened the score at 5-5, but
the Wildcats countered when prop
Mike Lassiter scored on a power-
ful run.

“We didn’ tcapitalize on many
opportunities. In general, it was a
sloppy game with lots of mistakes,”

. said Long.

The team agreed that it was a
less than inspired performance, but
they are looking forward to next
week’s season finale against UNC
Charlotte. The Wildcats, in one of
their biggest games of the year,
square off with the 49ers this Thurs-
day night at 7 p.m. on the field
behind Baker.

Volleyball drops
a pair of matches

By Drew WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

The volleyball team dropped
another two matches this week-
end, losing to Campbell on Friday
and Marshall Sunday.

The Marshall contest looked
bleak from the start, with the Wild-
cats (9-20) falling behind, 9-1. But

‘after a Davidson timeout, the team

rebounded to win the game, 15-12.

But they could not hold on to
the winning ways, dropping the
next three games, 15-4, 15-2, 15-0.
L.A. Bumgarner led the Wildcats
with 10 kills and Ginny Quis led
the team in assists with 17.

Davidson the two-goal lead to seal
the semi-final berth.

Despite the semifinal finish,
this season was frusrating for
Davidson (8-14, 4-4), marred by
poor performances against non-
conference powers, along with the
team’s struggle to break the upper
echelon of the Southern Confer-
ence - a league the Wildcats have
traditionally owned.

“I made a schedule for a team
that I thought could be a top 30
contender,” said Coach Charlie
Slagle. “Talent wise, I think we
had it, but we never got there as a

Slagle notes that seven of his
players were abroad for last
spring’ s practice season, something

_ that may have hott fis club this

season. :

“With that many guys gone, it
may have effected us, especially
early on,” he said.

With this campaign over, play-
ers and coaches are already talking
about an exciting fall 1997.

“We'll be back next year,”
said Stroble. “We are going to have

alotofleadership and committment
to winning.”
