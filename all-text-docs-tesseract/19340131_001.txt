PLAN THREE MEETS

Forensic Council Judges Debates
Held January 12

“Freshman debating tryouts proved
a great success from the standpoint of
this year’s freshman debates and from
the possibility of future varsity mate-
rial,” said E, J. Humphrey, president
of the Forensic Council, in comment-
ing upon the debate tryouts for first-
year men, completed Friday night,
January 12.

Men chosen for the yearling debat-
ing team are: Wilbur Edwards, C. T.
Mauze, A. T. Port, and Kenneth Scott,
with K. E. Fryfogle and H.-G. Sugg
as alternates. These men were chosen
from the final ten competing Friday.

The ability of the candidates as a
whole is evidenced by the fact that
the judges debated an hour and a half
before rendering their decisions.

From those competing Wednesday
were chosen Gaw, Gracie, Mauze, Port
and Sugg, and of those debating

Members of French
Society Give Comedy

Le Cercle Francais Is Entertained
at Winthrop

Seventeen Davidson members of Le
Cercle Francais, honorary French fra-
ternity, were guests of the French so-

#ciety at Winthrop College at Rock Hill
«won. Tuesday, January 16th,

“=A complimentary dinner, prepared
and served by the girls of the Win-
throp organization, was served in the
parlors of Johnson Hall, and a social
hour was enjoyed with musical num-
bers furnished by the visitors and sing-
ing of French songs by the two clubs.
At 7:30, a public performance was
given in the auditorium of Johnson
Hall, with apppoximately three hun-
dred persons in attendance.

The Winthrop group presented
“L’Arleqinade,” a comedy in two tab-
leaux. The Davidson club gave a pro-
gram of five numbers: “La Poule et
ses Poulins,” dramatic monologue by
Lanier Pratt, president of the David-
son Chapter of the fraternity; a; solo
by Dave McLain, accompanied by Bill
Hart; “Berceuse de Jocelyn,” by
Frank Tucker, and a one-act play,
“L’Anglais Tel Qu’on le Parle,” by
Tristin Bernard. At the conclusion of
the public meeting an informal recep-
tion was held,

The Davidson French Club has been
a leader in similar joint meetings. Last
year the Converse College Alliance
Francaise was entertained in Davidson
with a joint program given in Cham-
bers Auditorium. The club also made
excursions to Queens-Chicora and Sa-
lem Colleges, and in November a trip
was made to Converse College. It is
expected that the French Club of Sa-
lem will yisit Davidson in February.

Plant” In

In a recent issue of “The Ray,” offi-
cial organ of Gamma Sigma Epsilon,
national honorary chemical fraternity,
there appeared an article entitled
“Notes on the Depression Flower,” by
O. J. Thies, professor of chemistry at
Davidson College.

Gamma Sigma Epsilon was founded
at Davidson in 1919, and since that
time it has grown steadily. In the last
few years, especially, the fraternity has
shown a rapid growth in size, and in-
terest of the members has shown a
marked improvement.

Professor Thies is a member of the
Executive Grand Council of the fra-
ternity, and he has the distinction of
being the Senior Grand Officer of the
fraternity in point of service. He was
recently re-clected to the office of
Grand Keeper of the Kult, in which
capactiy he has served the fraternity
during every biennium except that of
1929-31. With one exception, Profes-
sor Thies holds the lowest initiation
number of any member of the fra-
ternity who is now actively engaged in
chemistry as a profession. Professor
Thies has taken an active part in the
work of the fraternity ever since his
initiation.

In preparing for his article on the
depression flower, Professor Thies
spent much time in research and study
on the subject. The following are a
few excerpts from his thesis:

“A few months ago no home was
complete without its depression flower.
The craze for*this flower-like chem-
ical growth spread from the home to
the office, to the hospital, to the school
room, and to the chemical laboratories.

Photographer Will
Return February 7

Many Students to Have Their
Pictures Taken

The annual photographer will be at
Davidson the seventh and eighth of
February. At this time the staff hopes
to complete the pictures for this year’s
Quips and Cranks.

Work on the book has progressed
very rapidly and successfully thus far.
The Senior Section has already been
completed. The staff is at present
working on the Snap Shot Section,
and they are very anxious to receive
any snap shots that the students might
have.

On the seventh and eighth the pho-
tographer will take the remaining
group pictures and the pictures of
those students who have not yet had
them made.

Many students have already signi-
fied their intention of having their-pic-
tures made at this time by making
appointments with members of the
staff. It is requested that all students
who intend to have their pictures made
see some member of the staff as soon
as possible.

This year’s staff is anxious to have
as many as is possible of the students’
pictures appearing in the book. There-
fore it is imperative that the staff
know how many students intend to
have photographs made, so that they
can be made with the least trouble
during this short visit of the pho-
tographer.

Quadwranglers Discuss

Methods of Education

On the evening of Thursday, Janu-
ary 25, the Quadwranglers held their
regular meeting in their room in
Chambers Building. Dr. P. H. Gwynn
gave a short address on “The Liberal
Arts College,” quoting as authorities
many prominent college presidents,
educators, and editors.

It would seem from Dr. Gwynn’s
survey that sufficient emphasis is not
placed on the instruction given to the
small percentage of real scholars in
the student body of the average lib-
eral arts college. In such colleges, at
the present, with their great “teach-
ing loads,” the best that can be done
is to aim at the average student. In
some instances, like Swarthmore Col-

Students Offered
Additional Courses

Harding and Douglas to Give
New Classes

In addition to the courses given this
past semester, several courses will be
offered beginning with the opening of
the second semester.

Dr. Douglas will offer a course in
Radio which will have for its pre-
requisite one semester of Physics, and
will offer three semester hours of
credit without laboratory work. Four
semester credit will be given if lab-
oratory work is taken.

in History of Fine Arts. However,
this course will take on a new phase
of work and new members of the class
can begin work during the second
semester without material loss in
background. The Greek Poets and the
English Verse will also be offered, and
scientific Greek will also be continued.
If there is sufficient demand a ‘course
in every-day Greek will be offered,
having for its prerequisite two years
of Greek,

T. W. Tingle Makes

Trips During Exams

Attends Meetings in Winston-
Salem and Washington

Dr. T. W. Lingle made trips to Win-
ston-Salem and Washington, D. C.,
during examinations. He made the
first trip to Winston-Salem to speak
to the Civitan Club at the Robert E.
Lee Hotel on foreign relations of the
American government, The same eve-
ning he gave an address to the annual
meeting of the board of directors of
the Y. W. C. A., at whose dinner
about two hundred people attended.

Later in the week Dr. Lingle spent
several days in Washington discussing
some of our foreign problems, empha-
sizing World Court, allied debts and
our naval policy with England and
Japan. This last topic he discussed at
length with Congressman Vinson of
Georgia, chairman of the Committee
on Naval Affairs of the House of Rep-
resentatives. The naval bill presented
by Mr. Vinson is now being discussed
in the House.

Dr. Lingle also discussed the prob-
lem of our relations of the World

LANDMARK IN RUINS

Provides Material for Construc-
tion of Brick Walks

A landmark in this historic old town
was destroyed this week. The near-
century-old house in which over half
of the presidents of Davidson College
lived during their terms today is only
a pile of brick and shattered concrete.
The old residence, steeped in history
and tradition, was destroyed to pro-
vide material for the construction of a
brick walk in the city of Davidson.
The work was done by the Civil Works
Administration.

For as long as the oldest person in
Davidson can remember, the old house
has stood opposite the northwest cor-
ver of the campus, surrounded by trees

and ina virtual state of ruin. Directly
across the highway stands Shearer
Hall, constructed partially from the

old chapel, which was built at David-
son_in the forties, when the school
was jstill in its infancy.

The old structure which housed so
many of Davidson's leaders was built
in 1848, at the then exorbitant cost of
$2,100, and was occupied in 1849, when
the college was just twelve years old,
by the second president of the insti-
tution, Dr. Samuel Williamson. The
only other buildings on the campus at
this time were the chapel, the literary
society halls, still standing, and five
dormitories, low rambling brick build-
ings, two of which are still in use
at Davidson.

Following Dr. Williamson, five other

Psychology Society
Discusses Reflexes

~

W. T. Thompson Makes Principal
Talk at Meeting

“The Conditioned Reflex” was_the
subject for discussion at the, regular
meeting of Omega Phi Alpha, the
philosophy and psychology group, held
at Social Center Friday evening a fort-
right ago, at which Jack Williams, Jr.,
the president of the chapter, presided.

W. Taliaferro Thompson gave a dis-
cussion of “The Conditioned Reflex,”
his contribution representing a close
study of this phenomenon. He showed
that the salivation produced in Pav-
lov's dogs is not a reflex in the physi-
ological sense of a simple isolated re-
sponse to a simple stimulus. He con-
tinued by saying that if the Pavlovian
studies are taken as indicating most
accurately the nature of a conditioned
reflex, the reflex, then, is a response
which resembles the uncondi-
tioned one. He: next examined the
factors which affect the stability of
the conditioned response once it has
been developed.

He pointed out that much. human
learning, whether it be learning non-
sense syllables in the laboratory or
safety habits in crossing the street, re-
mains stable because it serves to sat-
isfy the individual’s desires. Thompson
concluded his remarks by announcing
that if this examination is accurate,
the conditioned reflex reveals the pri-
mary and secondary factors involved
in all learning.

Following this there was a general
discussion of the topic, in which each
member present took part. Other sub-
jects discussed were Gestalt psychol-
ogy and the errors in Critiques of the
Gestalt theories, and mesmerism.
After the program a social hour was
enjoyed, in which refreshments con-
sisting of tea, cheese sandwiches, and
olives were served.

More than ordinary interest has
been manifested in the club this year,
and “President Williams says that he
is anxious to stimulate interest in fur-
ther research in these fields. At the
next business meeting, the club will
vote on new members. Membership
inthe club is restricted to those who
have taken advanced courses in phil-
osophy and psychology and have
proved themselves unusually proficient

only

in these subjects.

Grades

The first semester grades will
be sent out about the middle of
this week, according to an an-
nouncement from the registrar's
office. All grades this year will
be sent out from the registrar's
office in accordance with the fac-
ulty ruling to that effect. One
copy of the grades will be sent
to the student’s home, and each
student will receive the other
copy through the mail.

Dr. Macartney Will
