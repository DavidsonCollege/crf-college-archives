Does it Matter?
Recently, the Davidson Infir-

mary has attempted to come up
with a solution to the rapid in-
crease of sexually transmitted dis-
eases (STDs) on campus. The
alarming facts are that 78% of the
student body has now contracted
syphilis, 52% has gonorrhea, and
one soccer player has passed on
genital worts to at least 62 females
and 3 males.

The infirmary attributes these
large figures to the size of the cam-
pus. One infirmary worker, Vinny
Rheal, states, “This school is so
small that everyone hooks up with
everyone else. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if every person on this cam-
pus has had sex with every other
person at least once. I mean,
everyone’s so horny here. I’ve
never seen such a pack of rabbits!”

Visiting infirmary physician,
B. Lou Ballsmeyer, agrees. “This
horny thing is putting every stu-
dentatrisk—especially those loose
InterVarsity members. All I know
is that we had to come up with a
solution fast! We also wanted our
proposal to be something that the
students would adhere to. That’s
why we made it into sort ofa
“bandwagon” club with a cool
name and acronym.”

The infirmary has proposed a
new group on campus that would
be funded by the Activities Tax
Council, called FLOTT (Friends
Leaving on Their Trousers). Mem-

bers of this group willagreetoonly —

having dry sex (also called “dry

humping”) when they hook up,
and will leave posters and fliers
around campus reminding all stu-
dents of the benefits of leaving on
their clothes.

Ballsmeyer explains, “We got
the idea one day when we were
walking outside and saw two dogs
engaging in foreplay. At first we
thought, ‘Maybe we could ask the
Students to only smell eachothers’
butts,’ but then we realized that dry
sex was the real answer. This way,
students won’t run the risk of ex-

, wholeheartedly
backed by SHOC and CCRL, has
only found opposition in the laudry
service. One laundry worker was
overheard saying, “I thoughtclean-
ing those dirty sheets was bad
enough. I used to be able to pre-
tend that the students were blow-
ing their noses in the sheets. I
won’t be able to convince myself
that’s what they’re doing in the
crotchesof their pants! This group
must be stopped.”

Despite. these complaints, it
seems almost inevitable that
FLOTT will receive acharter from
the SGA. Alden Smith, president

of the SGA, has already been

quoted.as saying, “When I first
heard about this dry humping thing,
I thought it was pretty sick. But
then I tried it, and it really works.
Both my partner and I were com-

pletely satisfiedafter we weredone, --

and we only made a mess on our-
selves.” With a big smile, he con-

cluded, “Mostimportantly, Ireally
enjoyed myself!!”

After the FLOTT charter
passes through the SGA, the group
will have elections for its leaders,
and will enact its five-point pro-
posal to endorse sex with clothes
on: 1) toengagein dry sex, 2) toput

* up fliers and reminders of its ben-

efits, 3) to have special speakers
and lecturers conceming hump-
ing, 4) to have incoming freshman
read the best seller “Imaginary
Sex,” and 5) to have Davidson Plus

retreats that include “Dry Sex:
Hands On Training” seminars to
ensure that students are doing it
right.

When asked what he thinks
about the formation of a dry sex
group oncampus, Dean Terry said,
“T think it’s about time Davidson
students had this type of group to
turn to. I’ve always felt kind of
lonely, like I’m the only one who
engages in dry humping. Now 1
know I’m not, and I’m sure there
are a lot of students out there that

will be as relieved as lam. We’re
definitely not alone. I truly hope
FLOTT becomes a permanent es-
tablishment on this campus, and I
dream of the day when all students
and faculty will join. . .envisiona
campus of humping harmony, and
that makes me smile.”

Vax Sex Splurge Covers Campus

By Gross

A new outbreak on campus
has caught the attention of the ad-
ministration and trustees. Several
Students, feeling that phone sex
900 numbers are too expensive,
begana new type of alternative sex
— Vax Sex. This phenomenon
started around the beginning of
this fiscal year, and has many el-
ders and cool people in an outrage.

When [heard about this Vax
Sex,” one prominent trustee is
quotedassaying, “I thought it might
bea good alternative to those large
phone bills, so I tried it. However,
when I found out it was run by a
bunch of computer nerds, it was
completely ruined for me. I mean,

how can you imagine you're con-
versing with a hot, buxom babe
when you know. it’s just some fat
guy getting off on the other end of
the line? Besides, anyone on the
Vax is obviously not in a private

place, and I think getting off in the —

computer center is pretty sick."
The fact that most students do
notownamodem (adevice needed
to access the Vax system) has the
faculty in an uproar, Because they
don’town modems, students using
the system are obviously using it
either in the library or in the com-
puter center. “We must be very
careful to keep these people out of
the library,” said library coordina-
tor Dr. Leland Park. “I’ve already

had seyeral students complain that
the keyboards on the CHAL com-
puters are sticky and difficult to
operate.” Another difficulty that
concerns students and faculty alike
is that there is no way of finding
out who the actual sex perpetrators
are,

An addition to the computer
system will be installed by the fall
of next year that will enable the
administration to trace the original
sex Vax. However, as of now,
these perpetrators, also called
“Wooker Hookers,” will be able to
get away with their crude com-
puter conversations.

“T think it’s disgusting,” said
one cool SAE. “Think about it. I

could be innocently writing a pa-

per in the computer center, and |

there could be some sicko next to
me ‘getting off’ because of some
stupid writing on a computer
screen. I wish I could just turn to
these people and say, ‘Hey, you,
get a freaking life! Go find your-
self somereal action, trekky!’ They
really piss me off.” (The SAE then
proceeded to gargle gasoline, spit
it on the ground, and light a stolen
modem on fire in a demonstration
of his anger because SAEs are al-
ways violent).

Despite this open opposition,
it has become obvious that the In
Crowd is not the only group deter-
mined to stop the Wooker Hook-

ers. :
The director of the Residence
Life Office, Dick Terry, is trying
to come up with a solution to the
problem, as well. “Many faculty
members have come to me tocom-
plain about these disgusting people,
and I now see that I need to get off
my ass and try to stop them.
“One solution we are looking
at is to provide modems in every
room so thatthey can clean up their
Own mess in private. We’re also
thinking of working with the Ad-
missions Office to keep these freaks
out of this school, But we’ll still
have to deal with at least four more
years of these honkin’ dorks.”
