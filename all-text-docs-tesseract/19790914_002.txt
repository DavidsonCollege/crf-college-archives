for the new dorms—$200, 000
from the Belk Foundation of
Charlotte and $200,000 more
from an undisclosed source.
Spencer said that the dorms
should cost about $500,000
apiece.

Rooms will be arranged in
clusters, with four clusters and
a lounge on each floor. Each
dorm will have two floors.

There is a possibility that two
more new dorms will be built.
Spencer. said, ‘“‘One of the
things that will determine if we
build two or four dorms is
whether or not we receive a loan
from HUD.” Spencer said that

’ “it
“would give us an | opportunity t to
add approximately one hundred
‘female students to the total

approval.”’

The revenues from one hun-
dred new students would allow
the college to hire eight new
professors. Thus, the student-
‘faculty ratio would remain
about 13 to 1. According to
Spencer, ‘Increasing the enroll-
ment would not decrease the
quality of education and might
even increase it.” Terry said

Commons construction to begin i in ‘80

By BOE YOUNG
Staff Correspondent

Construction of the campus
Commons, a new three million
dollar eating facility for fresh-
men and independents ‘‘will
hopefully begin by January
1980,” says Director of Physical
Plant Grover Meetze and ‘‘sho-
uld be completed in 18 mon-
ths.”

Originally plans call for begi-
nning at the start of this
summer. However construction
was. delayed so that surveying
for an alternative location in the
Lingle Manor area could take
place,

According to Meetze, more
time was needed since the

moving of power ii es and
excessive landscaping, all of
which woudl be a necesvity if
thee Commons were to be built
where planned, was thought too
costly at the time.

._The Commons will be built
between where Bailey and Rich-
ards stand now.

Bailey and Richards will be
moved to other locations on
Patterson Court; Bailey betwe-
en F&M and ETC, and Richar-
ds between Rusk and PAX.

Presently the project is in
the blue print stage with Little
Associates hired to do the
designing. However, the const-

ruction contract is still open.
