Three teams: vie for title

of freshman advisor

By DAVE KELLER
Executive Editor

Competing for the title of
Freshman Advisors are three
pairs of juniors: Jane Perkins
and Joe Craig, Holt Foushee
and Graeme Thomson, and
Meg Campbell and Bruce Hol-
liday.

Freshman advisors in the
past have been instrumental
during freshman orientation
and the first part of the school
year, but have faded into the
background as the year pro-
gresses. All three teams, how-
ever, want to change this
situation.

‘We want to visit each hall
at least two times a year to
talk, give and take sugges-
tions, and to generally make
ourselves available as real
advisors,’’ said Perkins. Craig
added that he hoped to esta-
blish the advisors as inter-
mediates between hall counse-
lors and Will Terry.

Holliday said, ‘‘We hope to
make a conscious effort to
work with the freshmen and
the hall counselors after orien-
tation.”

All candidates also agreed
that there aren’t enough acti-
vities planned for freshmen
during the year.

‘We want to organize more
activities between halls, espe-
cially,”’ said Holliday.

Thomson suggested another
freshman talent show during
the year, and Foushee said,
“We want to prompt the hall
counselors to have spontane-
ous activities for their halls
during the year, to promote
hall spirit and inter-hall rival-
ries.”

We want to space out
parties and activities during
the school year,’’ said Craig.
“We would like to promote a
fairer distribution of money
among halls.’’ Perkins added
that there should be more
activity between freshmen and
upperclassmen, ‘and that the
advisors could generate more
enthusiasm for IMAC-

‘The attitudes of his hall
counselors are crucial to the
attitude a student takes to-
ward Davidson,’ said Holli-
day, concerning hall counselor

influence. ‘“‘This influence is
what really makes freshman
advisors important, because
the advisors are responsible
for hall counselor training and
coordination.”

Both of the other two teams
felt that the influence of the
hall counselors is especially
profound in the first few
weeks. All groups felt that hall
counselors had to be friends as
well as authority figures.

Foushee and Thomson em-
phasized that their not being
hall counselors gives them a
better perspective of the role
of freshman advisors. ‘‘We
won't feel tied td the present
system,’’ said Thomson.’

‘‘We want to revitalize rela-
tionships between students
and faculty,’’ said Perkins.
‘‘We want to get good rela-
tionships started at the begin-
ning of freshman year, and we
especially want the freshmen
to get to know Will Terry and
Dr. Spencer.”

Campbell said, ‘‘We have
both been hall counselors and
are a coed team, which we feel
is important.”’

Five people seek Union positions

By AMANDA HALL
Sports Editor

Five people are vying for
three positions on the College
Union Board: Bob Hill and
Billy Hutchings for Union
President, Olivia Ware and
John Kravet for Co-Curricular
Vice-President, and Mark
Tyndall, uncontested for Soc-

‘ial Vice-President.

The Union Board President
presides at Union Board and
Union Board Executive meet-
ings. He represents the Union
into faculty and administra-
tion, and coordinates all the
Union's activities.

‘“‘T think the Union Board
President is mainly supposed
to get the ideas of the stu-
dents,’’ said Presidential can-
didate Hill. ‘‘His main func-
tion is coordination of activi-
ties. I can’t say it’s that
administrative, but it’s basi-
cally to find what the students
want and to try to put them
into effect.”

He is running for the posi-
tion because he ‘‘thinks the
social side of the college is the
most important. The Union ‘is
here to provide experiences
you won't get a review on—it
provides everything you don’t
get in books.”’

Hill plans to get more
students involved in Union
activities, to build better rela-
tions with Patterson Court,
and to have more social stu-
dent/faculty _ interrelations.
He hopes to hold planning
sessions once a week in the
Union lobby to let students
voice their opinions in proce-
dures. —

He has never held a Union
position before, but “‘I’ve been

a step and fetch-it for the
Union for the past two and a
half years. Now I’ve been
active with the planning com-
mittee, so I do know the
Union,” he said.

“The Union is the campus’
jewel; I’d like to see the
campus make use of it. We’ve
done a lot of experimentation
so far and I don’t want to see
that end,’’ Hill concluded.

Hutchings is running for
Union Board President be-
cause ‘‘I’m interested in the

Hill

job. The main thing right now
that’s involved in the job is
that we’ve gotten used to
having this place around. Sys-
tems are beginning to work,
and I want to keep them that
way,” he said.

“The Union is working now,
and I want to carry on what’s
going on aa I don’t want to
tear anything down to restruc-
ture, because it is working,
any reconstruction will come
later,’”’ said Hutchings.

He believes one of the major
weaknesses of the program ‘‘is
that people still aren’t talking
to others and saying ‘Hey,
let’s go over to the Union and
do such and such.’ There’s a
bundle of things that aren't

being done and people ought °

to know they can use this
place and come over,”’ he said.

“T generally want to expand
the Union so people will have
something else to do,’’ he said.
“The Union and Patterson
Court will have to get together
more on who’s holding what so
we don’t have something big
going on in the Union and
three or four parties on the
court,”” ~

Hutchings has held no posi-
tions in the Union either, but
he is the social chairman at
Fanny and Mabel's, the Vice
President of the Black Student
Coalition and a Hall Counse-
lor.

The Co-Curricular Vice
President coordinates the act-
ivities of the Co-Curricular
Council of the Union, includ-
ing serving on the Artist
Series Committee and the
Union Board and Executive
Committee.

Olivia Ware is running for
Co-Curricular Vice President
because, ‘‘I’m interested in the
committees, in co-curricular.
I’ve been indirectly and direct-
ly involved with the Union
since I was a freshman and
I’m sympathetic. to the
cause.”

“I’m also interested in stu-
dents and feel'I’m pretty
receptive to their needs,” she
said.

Ware plans to develop the
smaller committees in the
Co-Curricular Council. ‘‘Basi-
cally I think that there are
some smaller committees, like
poetry, that the students do
not get a feel for. The larger
ones pretty much run them-
selves; they’re a standard
thing on the Davidson cam-

pus,” she said.
She also plans to try to
coordinate the committees like

’ Open End and Speakers to

allow them to make their
guests more available to stu-
dents, by having an Open End
with a Speaker, or an Evening
With or Open End guest.

“TI think the basic qualifica-
tion for the office is a feel for
Union programming, and that
comes from experience. I also
feel I’m creative enough to
deal with the ups and downs,”
she said.

Ware has had experience
with four Union committees,
Open End, Evening With...,
concert and pop films.

Kravel is “interested in the
workings of the Union,” and is
running to be able to ‘‘insti-
tute some of the plans people

Hutchings

have given to me—some
things the Union hasn’t done
this year,”’ he said.
“Co-Curricular is where my
interests lie right now. Work-
ing through Steve (Steve Pee-
ples, current Co-Curricular
Vice President) I’ve realized
that cultural events are really
appealing to me,” he said.
Kravet has two areas he
wants to develop if he is
elected: informal committees
and the use of student opin-

ions and suggestions.

‘‘I’d like to see some. more
emphasis on Open End and
Evenings With... They’re a
little less formal, especially
Open End. I see a lot of people
with questions and they don’t
know who to talk to. The Open
Ends are a place they can get
their questions answered.

“T think Evenings With...
and Open Ends should be
more open to what the stu-
dents want,”’ he said.

“T’d like people to come to
the Union and tell us what
they want to see. If the
students don’t voice their
opinions of what they want we.
should go directly to them,”’
he said.

“One of the Open Ends I’d
like to institute if I get elected
is one.to get to know the
Union officials. Everyone on
campus should know the Un-
ion Board and where to go to
voice their opinions,’’ Kravet
said.

He has worked on no com-
mittees as such, but has
worked closely with Peeples
lately.

Tyndall, running uncontes-
ted for Social Vice President,
says he is running because ‘‘I
like entertainment, the indus-
try and the intrigue. I like the
feeling of participation in the
decision making processes: I
like to relate student opinion
—as far as I can tell what that
is—to the decisions made by
the Union Board.

‘I’ve got some contacts
among the student body that
will give me help there as
opposed to the bird in the
guilded cage viewpoint,’ he
said.
