Showcase

The Charlotte Consortium is going to open the door for student talent this
weekend. Seven area colleges will participate in ‘‘Showcase” this Saturday
afternoon and night, sending from one to four of their most capable student
groups to perform in Davidson’s 900 Room.

“The object is not to rank groups at all. It’s very clearly not a competition.
We just want the opportunity to see these people perform—either to invite them
back or to decide they don’t really fit what we do,’’ explained Assistant Union
Director William Brown.

The other colleges will also be perusing Davidson's acts to see who they think
would do a good job in their unions. Talent scouts from several Charlotte
restuarants will also be in the audience. Everything is open to the public. The
afternoon session will last from 2 to 5:30. The evening is set to start at 7 and is
projected to run until 10:30 or 11.
