Raney awarded prestigious Watson scholarship

Senior to compare occurrence of rape to sexual roles

By MARY RUSS
Senior Milbrey “Mibs” Raney
was recently awarded the Thomas
J. Watson Scholarship for her -
creative proposal for study abroad.
As a result, she will spend next
year in France, Montreal, Quebec

and Martinique researching her
interest in the correlation between
polarized sex roles (in the French
culture) and the incidence of rape.

The scholarship was estab-
lished by Thomas Watson, who,
upon graduating from college,

wandered Europe with hopes of
figuring out what to do with the
rest of his life. He returned to
America and founded IBM.
Convinced of the benefits of
study and experience abroad, Wat-
son established his scholarship for

- to recognize

the sole purpose of providing
worthy graduates with the oppor-
tunity to study and learn abroad as
he did, so that pi:
they’ might
better focus
their aims in
life.

The schol-
arship tends

those — stu-
dents with the
most creative
or “off-the-
wall” propos-
als for re-
search.

The __re-
quirements of
the scholar-
ship are that
the selected student must study

abroad for a period of nine to
twelve months, and that the re-

search conducted may neither be
in the United States nor in a coun-
try very similar to the United
States.

Al -
though
several
students
from one
college
may be
selected
to enter
the na-
tionwide
competi-
tion for
the Wat-
s on
honor,
only 75
students
are chosen from across the nation
to receive the $13,000 scholar-
ships.

‘Davidson hosts prominent

South African activists

By KEVIN DUNN
Last Monday the college hosted
three distinguished South African
citizens for lunch. Through the
work of the Dean Rusk Program in
International Studies, a number of
students and faculty were able to
engage the Rev. Mcebisi O.
Xundu, the Rev. Zwelinzima M.
Mjekula and Marie Burton in a
conversation concerning topics
relevant to southern Africa—in-
vestments, sanctions and United
States foreign policy towards Af-
rica.
_ Xundu and Mjekula, both An-

~ glican priests, are active in the

Opposition movements against
their country’s policy of racial
segregation, called apartheid.
Burton is the president of Black
Sash, the largest women’s move-

ment in the Republic of South:

Africa. Composed: primarily of
white South Africans sympathetic
to the cause of the black majority,
the organization was founded in

“the late 1950s and has played sig-

nificant roles in the struggle
against apartheid and in the effort
to aid its victims.

In addition to organizing peace-
ful demonstrations, ‘sustaining
contact with international observ-
ers and otherwise exerting pres-
sures for change, Black Sash has
provided assistance for the fami-
lies of detainees and for victims of
abuse. Despite continued harass-
ment from government forces,
Black Sash has established itself

_ aS a constructive force for white
’ liberals working for change in

South Africa. _

The topics of discussion cen-
tered primarily on the role of pri-
vate institutions and the United
States government in the Repub-
lic: The debate became more in-
tense as opinions clashed on the
issue of sanctions and divestment.
The three guests, however, pre-
sented a balanced perspective as
the somewhat radical Xundu and
the moderate Mijekula presented
their views on economic sanctions

against South Africa. Black Sash
neither endorses or opposes sanc-
tions or divestment...

There. was a.consensus among
the guests concerning the need for
a greater understanding by Ameri-
cans of the events in Southern and
South Africa. According to them,
it is difficult for Americans to
acquire accurate information
about the South African situation.
The three also stressed the impor-
tant roles being played by the
United Democratic Front (UDF)
and the African National Congress
(ANC) in South Africa. The guests
encouraged the United States gov-
ernment and individual institu-
tions such. as Davidson College to
extend recognition to these two
anti-apartheid movements.

_ The guests are visiting America
under the auspices of the U.S. In-
formation Agency. The Dean
Rusk Program was able to host
their visit to the college due to the
generosity of the Charlotte Inter-
