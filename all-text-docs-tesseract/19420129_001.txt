wrestling will be attempted.

Mission Meet

Twenty Davidson Students
Go To Convention

More than twenty Davidson boys
attended the Second Quadrennial
Youth Convention on World Mis-
sions held in Memphis, Tenn., from
December 30-Jan. 1. The purpose
of the convention was “To Confront
Presbyterian youth of this student
generation with the world’s present
desperate need of Christ, ~and
Christ’s challenge to them as they
face that need.”

Five Commissions

The whole program _of the con-
vention was built around the reports
of five commissions, each of whjch
investigated some topic connected
with missions and presented their
reports to the whole group. These
topics were all some phase of the
theme “Christ, the Church, and the
World” which in turn was based
on the proposition “Thy Will Be
Done.”

High point of the convention,
which was attended by 1,465 young
people from outside Memphis and
approximately 600 others, came on
the final night in the Memphis
Municipal Auditorium in which
most of the program was carried
on. At that time Dr. C. Darby
Fulton, of ‘Nashville Tenn, Exe-
cutive Secretary of Foreign Mis-
sions brought the closing challenge
“We Dedicate Ourselves.” Nearly
4,000 people crowded into the audi-
torium to hear Dr. Fulton’s address,
in which he called upon the group
to pray, persevere, and sacrifice.

Other principal addresses were
given by Dr. W. T. Thompson of
Richmond, Va.,‘on “God's Will for
His World”; Dr. John A. Mackay,
of Princeton Seminary, on “The
World Scene;” Dr. James L. Fowle,
of Chattanooga, Tenn. on “The
Adequacy of Christ”; Mr. R. H.
Edwin Espy, of New York City,
on “The Mission of the Church in
the World Today”; Miss Ruth Sea-
bury, of Boston, on “Youth An-
swers the Call.”

Worship for the entire conven-
tion was led by Dr. Frank H. Cald-
well, President of Louisville Pres-
byterian Theological Seminary, as-
sisted. by the A Capella Choir of
the General Assembly’s Training
School:and Union Theological Sem-
inary, Richmond, Va. Dr. Charles
E. Diehl, Moderator of the General
Assembly, opened the convention
with words of welcome.

Last fall the Davidson-Cornelius
Chapter of the Red Cross voted
to give up its charter and merge
with the Mecklenburg County chap-
ter of the Red Cross. This move
was dictated by the lack of equip-
ment at Davidson to deal with the
increased activities of the Red Cross.
By merging with the large county
chapter the opportunities for local
Red Cross work in Davidson were
strengthened rather than lessened.

After the annual meeting of the
Mecklenburg Chapter of the Red
Cross, held in Charlotte on Janu-
ary 16, Dr. James A. Alexander,
chairman of the Mecklenburg
€ounty Chapter of the Red Cross,
announced that Dr. W. P. Cumming
of the English Department was
elected toomembership on the board
of directors of the chapter.

One hundred and eighty-five dol-

complete the amount pledged for
this -year’s fund. Monroe Bush
has expressed the hope of receiv-
ing the balance of unpaid pledges
as soon as possible so that the cam-
paign can be closed.

“We are very greatly pleased,”
said Bush, “with the way students
and other subscribers have been
prompt with their voluntary gifts.
The whole campaign and response
has been an inspiration to the Y.
M. C. A. and others interested in
our work.”

The Y. M. C. A. Cabinet orig-
inally set a goal of $1,000, later
changing it to $1,500, when they
began to receive such a generous
response. Five hundred fifty dona-
tions were given, and five hundred
thirty-eight of these were gifts out
of the student "body.

Two dollars and eighty-four
cents was the average donation of
all gifts, while $2.78 was the aver-
age student donation.
