Dormitory

AN ANALYSIS

PHIL BISHOP

Dissension and_ con-
tradictory opinions within the
administration on the
proposed construction of five
new dormitories has reached
an alarming state, threat-
ening the very construction
of these dormitories.

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. recently stated
LL cc

that he now favors a delay in
the construction of these dor-
mitories.

“I just do not see how we are
satisfactorily going to finance
the dorms. Therefore, with the
information I now possess, I
would have to say that I favor
a delay in dormitory con-
struction,’’ Spencer said.
“This will probably
necessitate a leveling off of
the total enrollment at about
1200 students."’

On the other hand, Director
of Student Housing Scotty
Nicholls feels that ‘‘new
housing should be a top
priority, perhaps even more
important than the new
library.”

Dean of Students Will Terry,
a member of the Committeeon
Future Housing whose job it
was to study the need for and
construction of new housing,
agreed that the new dorms
need to be built.

“T think Davidson's
movement in the direction of
the trustees’ goal of 1500
students by 1981 is important
and should go on,”’ he said.

The problem which these
basic differences of opinion
between the Committee on
Future Housing and the
president bring out is that
there seem to be jumbled
lines of communication bet-
ween the various people
responsible for making the

Sig Ep Decision To Bid Early Conflicts
With College Self-Selection Schedule

Sigma Phi Epsilon, one of
the off-campus national
fraternities, decided in a
meeting Tuesday to rush, bid,
and pledge freshmen the first
week of winter term.

This differs from the struc-
tured self-selection process on
Patterson Court which is
slated for the sixth and seven-
th week of winter term.

Up until this time, the col-
lege administration and the
Council of Social
Organizations (which
establishes the social policy
for the on-campus program)
had assumed that Sig Ep bid-
ding would be in accordance
with the eating club schedule.

The self-selection timetable
was set up last Spring by the
Council of Social
Organizations. At that timeSig
Ep representative Jim Coggin
expressed an intent to attempt
to cooperate within the
system s guidelines

However, since Sig Ep is
non-participating member on
the council, no definite com-
mitment was ever made.

Notably, the only significant
change is that Sig Ep bidding
and pledging will occur at an
earlier date. The Council’s
guidelines in no way would
have effected an active rush

by any group.

Mitch Purvis, president of
the Council of Social
Organizations, revealed that
he was di inted and felt
that the Council was let down.

Purvis recalled that last
spring the Council was
created to get everyone

together on rushing and bid-
ding. The on-campus houses

originally wanted _ self-
selection to occur at the begin-
ning of the winter term.

However, the general con-
sensus among hall counselors
was that selection of an eating
house or fraternity should oc-
cur in the spring term.

The sixth and seventh week
of winter term was set as a
compromise between the best
interests of the houses and the
freshmen.

Purvis noted that, with cer-
tain groups bidding earlier
than scheduled, the freshman
faces two ‘“‘crisis periods.”’
First, the pressure of deciding
whether or not to accept a bid
and then later pressures when
confronted with the choice of
self-selecting into an eating
house.

Prior to last spring the only
organization controlling the
on-campus eating system was
the Patterson Court Council.
However, it excluded off-
campus national fraternities.
The Council was established to
remedy that by involving all
social groups. So, in effect, it
was a concession to the off-
campus nationals. So far, the
Council has dealt exclusively
with the open house and rush
systems.

“The Council is working for
the benefit of both the fresh-

men and the houses,”’ Purvis
added He expressed a need for
cooperation.

“At least a gentleman’s
agreement was made to work
for at least a one year period
with us. I feel that there
was an acceptable agree-
ment (by the Sig Eps) to
work with us and they have
backed out of it,’’ Purvis af-
firmed.

Duncan Baker , Sig Ep chap-
ter president, noted that the
abrupt change in policy was
instigated to make the system
‘more compatible with our

pledge program.”

Bidding will be changed to
the first part of the winter
term since this is a time at
which ‘‘academic pressures
are not as great as they would
be later on so freshmen an
better avail themselves of the
opportunity to get to know
us,’ Baker remarked.

He noted that the fraternity
traditionally had a prolonged
pledge program which would
have been restricted under the
fixed schedule.

Baker also commented that

final decision.

If there is in fact jumbled
communication, then this
needs to be rectified im-
mediately so that a decision
satisfactory to all can be
reached

This is complicated by the
fact that the Architect, Paul
Rudolph, has not yet given the
college a final projected figure
on the costs, or even final
drawings of the proposed
structures.

The planned completion of
the dorms is slated for the
fall of 1975; but if decisions
aren't made soon it is doubtful
that this deadline can possibly
be met.

The roots of the problem lie
in the financing of the dorms.
If the college were to borrow
money at the current high in-
terest rate to cover the costs,
which up until now it was
assumed the college would
have to do since no other
viable alternative had _ sur-
faced, then the college would
either have to charge a much
higher room rent to live in the
new dorms or spread the cost
by raising all room rents on
campus.

Even in this, there has been
disagreement. Nicholls main-
tains that ‘‘the highest figure
the Future Housing Com-
mittee discussed was $700 per
student if the money was re-
paid solely by the room rents
of the inhabitants of the new
dorms.”

Yet Spencer has referred to
a sum of $900-$1000 under the
same circumstances.

THE SIGHT OF FUTURE GLORIES
If the college can get the finances worked out, construction of five new dorms to house 250
students will begin within the next year on this land adjacent to the fraternity court.

Obstruction In Governance Examined

The whole impetus behind the

coming to a halt due to a fundamental

any change to abolish their sole final
jurisdiction in matters of educationa

The educational program and
policy of the college has been defined

and of curriculum requirements, the
determination of curriculum

determination of foreign study and

research, the determination of policy

materials, the awarding of degrees in-

the oversight of academic anid

initiated by academic departments,

mination of academic minimum stan-
dards for the admission of students.”’

The students don’t know what they
want or can expect in the way of re-
form. It is even uncertain what the
student representatives themselves
on the committee think.

The administration, while sup-
porting much of the student position,
is hesitant to forward any proposal to

the trustees for a final decision which

does not have the support ot the

faculty.

In this quagmire of political
motives and uncertain opinions, what
has happened to the reform itself?

This is difficult to ascertain because
of the secrecy which surrounds the
whole committee process. No one.

The faculty, led by their committee
