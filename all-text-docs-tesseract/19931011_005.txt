: Students question Davidson's Pass/Fail policy: Too restrictive?

By Katherine Hash

Questions are raised by stu-
dents about the legitimacy of stipu-
lations governing Davidson’s pass/
fail policy. Many feel that the
college ought to extend the time
allowed for pass/fail petition sub-
mission and keep students *choice
of the pass/fail grading mechanism
confidential.

Approximately 350 students
took classes on a pass/fail basis
last spring, but many came to re-
gret their decisions.

Sophomore Kakki McEntire
wanted to explore two new sub-
jects, philosophy and religion. Of

the two classes she chose to take:

religion pass/fail. She ended the
semester with an A, recorded on
her transcript as a "P", in religion
and a Cin her philosophy class.
McEntire insists that she could
have made a wiser decision if she
had a few more weeks to “feel out

the classes”- get to know the

amount and nature of the work
required and her chances of suc-
ceeding in each of the classes.

Other students fear that pro-
fessors will be prone to think of
those who choose the pass/fail op-
tion as “slackers” or as uninter-
ested.

Possible changes in the policy
could be extended deadlines--
variations irtclude three weeks into
the semester, mid-term, or end of
term--and a removal of the choice
of grading mechanism from Pre
fessors’ class rosters.

According to the current aca-
demic regulations, students who
wish to choose the pass/fail grad-
ing mechanism for a credit course
must file a pass/fail authorization
form with the registrar’s office
during the “regular registration
period” which includes the two-
week drop/add period at the begin-
ning of the semester.

Professors are informed of the
students pass/fail status on their
final class rosters.

Students may take up to six
classes on a pass/fail basis during
their college career. These classes
may count towards core but not
major requirements.

Apassing grade (P)isawarded
for work at the C level or above; a
D or below constitutes a failing
grade (F). A student’s choice of
grading option cannot be reversed
once the form is submitted.

Ms. Polly Griffin, registrar,
explains that the deadline for pass/
fail petitions results from “the phi-
losophy that the selection ofa grad-
ing mechanism is an integral and
inseparable part of the registration
process.”

Davidson’s pass-fail policy
regulations are standard and simi-
larto those of UNCC, UNC Chapel
Hill, and Washington and Lee.

Griffin disclaims students’
concerns that professors might be
biased against students who choose
the pass/fail option, arguing that
the faculty supports the notion of
pass/fail and realizes that students

will sometimes choose it in their
Classes. Griffin acknowledges the
possibility of change, but points
out that it would have to be ap-
proved by the faculty.

Dr. Earl Edmondson, profes-

‘sor of history, argues that the pri-

mary reason for the pass/fail sys-
tem would not beserved by chang-
ing the decision deadline. He sug-
gests the policy intends to “invite
students to explore areas outside
of their own areas of expertise
which they otherwise would not,”

According to Edmondson, the
choice to take a class pass/fail is,
ideally, made for the reason above

College gets gift-
100 years later

GETTYSBURG, Pa. (CPS)-
Gettysburg College recently re-
ceived the biggest single gift in its
history-$3.5 million- from a trust
fundestablished by an 1893 gradu-
ate.

Merle Stauffer Boyer’s will
stipulated that the college ulti-
mately would receive all proceeds
from a trust established to benefit
his two children, Kathyrn and
Donald in 1993. They left no
heirs, so the trust was dissolved
and the proceeds were given to
Gettysburg College.

“What makes the Merle
Boyer gift so special is that'stu-
dents who will make their mark
on the world of the 21st century
will have as their benefactor a
graduate from the 19th century,”
said college President Gordon
Haaland.

Straight group
supports gay rights
HOUSTON (CPS)- The
name says it all.
Straight But Not Narrow is a

group of heterosexual students
who have banded together to sup-
port gay and lesbian rights and
fight homophobia at the Univer-
sity of Houston.

“There is no reason for
homophobia,” John Cobb, presi-
dent of the new organization, told
The Daily Cougar. Cobb said his
group wanted to emphasize that
not all heterosexual people fear
homosexuals. “It’s simple. We’re
straight; but now narrow-minded,”
said Maryelaine Eckerle, vice
president of the group. “Every-
one should have equal rights, and
everyone should have the right to

. come out in support of gays and

be who they are.”

Mitchell Nicholas, executive
administrator of the Gay, Les-
bian and Bisexual Alliance, said
his group supported the efforts of
SBNN.

“You don’t have to bé gay to

lesbians’ equal rights,” Nicholas
said. “People are realizing that
95 percent of our lives are like
everyone else’s.”

Cobb said SBNN would be
involved in the National Coming
Out march and rally October 11
and AIDS Awareness Week in
November.

students with big ideas

MINNEAPOLIS (CPS)- A
new national grant program
dubbed “The Big Idea” offers stu-
dents $2,000 grants for designing
innovative service projects to
battle social problems in thier
campus. communities.

The program, sponsored by
the Jostens Foundation in part-
nership with the Campus Out-
reach Opportunity League
(COOL), announced the program,
which will provide grants to 10
students throughout the country
in September.

The projects must reflect
creativity and innovation, and
have the potential to be replicated
on other campuses.

“Further evidence of grow-
ing student concern over social
issues can be found in the profu-
sion of new student service orga-
nizations like COOL that have
sprung up since the late 1980s as
well as ina marked resurgence in
established service programs,”
COOL said.

in which case any knowledge rel-
evant to the decision (i.e. personal
background orinterest in thatarea)
is presumably already known.

Dr. Sam Maloney, professor
of religion, is opposed to changing
the deadline for making a decision
which, he says, ought to be based
on one’s predisposition towards
the subject not on class perfor-
mance. The policy, he maintains,
is “not designed to keep students
from getting Cs but to encourage
them to take classes necessary for
agood liberal arts education where
they might not make As.”

Edmondson sees how the pass/
fail system also functions as a “pres-
sure valve to relieve pressure at
least psychologically” for students
with tough schedules and recog-
nizes practical motivations for tak-

ing classes pass/fail. Edmondson
projects that the faculty would be
reluctant to allow these practical
considerations to overrule the ideal
basis of the system but admits that
he is willing to consider the idea.

Edmondson admitted that it
was possible, though not probable,
that professors would be biased
against pass/fail students. He per-
sonally makes a conscious effort
not.to register or pay attention to
that information on his class roster
and would not be opposed to it
being removed.

Proposals for change would
have to be brought before the Edu-
cational Policy Committee com-
posed of several faculty members
and two student representatives
with the registrar serving as an
advisor.
