Red Cross News

Who knows the story of the Giant
Scissors? It is about a young Prince,
whose father gave him a pair of scissors
instead of a sword and sent him out to
win his fortune. By and by, the young
Prince found that by helping people in
difficulties and distress, his scissors grew
sharper and stronger, and were able to
do quite as much for him as a sword.
But when he forgot-or neglected to use
his scissors and did no unselfish and
helpful deeds, his scissors grew dull and
stiff. So, he learned to look for kind
deeds to do and he won for himself a
host of friends and happiness, and his
scissors grew to be “giant scissors.”

Right here in our town some little
girls. a dozen of them, have .been using
their scissors to help provide comfort for
wounded soldiers. In the afternoons,
Miss Vic. Wither has had them gather
at her home and there they have pa-
tiently and painfully cut scraps to fill
comfort pillows for the use of — the
wounded on the battlefields. Many a
little hand has been blistered, but very
proudly borne for the sake of the Red
Cross. which the little girls wear on cil
and apron. We hope their scissors will
grow to be “giant scissors;” then. when
these little girls grow to be big girls. and
grown women, every place they go will
be a better and happier place, because of
their helpful hands and unselfish thought
of others.

Now, we have a plan. for these little
lunior girls—to gather whole lots of
Rawers and send bunches and bunches to
the hospital at Camp Greene for the
soldiers and nurses,

And little girls. will you please tell
the grown-up women in your family and
neighborhood, that their scissors can
grow, too, Though they can't go out
and. fight the enemy with a sword, thev
can use their scissors at home. and per-
haps help many a man to live and fight
another day. You see, the grown-ups
didn’t learn to do Red Cros work when
they were little, and they don’t seem to
learn fast enough, so will you please
help and just ask them all the time:
“Are vou doing your bit for Red Cross?”

This little poem was written hy one
of the Junior Red Croscers. age 8 years.
carly one morning while she was think-
ing of her work:

ARE YOU KNITTING?
A woman with knitting
And a little child, rao.
The soldiers are wearing
The knitting vou do.

As long as you're living
And knitting lots, too.

The soldiers are wearing
The knitting you do.

Is vour mother knitting?
And your sister, tao?
The soldiers are wearing

The knitting they do.

PHI'S WIN DECISION
TN FRESH-SOPH DEBATE

In Shearer Hall. last Monday night. —

the Fresh-Soph debating team of the
Phi Society clearly proved to the judges
that woman suffrage should not be
granted in the United States by ani
amendment to the Federal Constitution.
This being the first time that an inter- ,

The DAVIDSONIAN March 27, 1918

society debate has been held between the
Fresh-Soph teams, much interest was
shown by the student body. The Eu
team, composed of Love, Liston and Mc-
Girt, upheld the affirmative, while
Clontz, Knight and Chalmers, of the Phi
Society, defended the negative. Love
opened the debate for the affirmative. de-
fined the amendment that would be sub-
mitted and outlined the issue of the de-
bate. He argued that it is just that
woman should have the ballot because
she is a factor in the economic and in-
tellectual world and in this way earns
the right of the ballot. Clontz, the first
speaker of the negative, showed that the
issue of woman suffrage is fundamentally
wrong because women do not want the
ballot and it would be to the detriment
of the home. He showed further that
the experiment in states where it has been
in force for some time did not warrant
its adoption by all states.

Liston, the next speaker on the aftr
mative, brought out numerous instances
where better legislation has —
from woman suffrage. Knight. the sec
ond speaker for the negative, proved (1)
that woman has not the physical power
to back her ballot; (2) that the ballot
will not better her working condition.

MecGirt closed the debate for the af-
firmative by showing that) a national
amendment is the best wav to obtain suf-
frage. Chalmers, who closed the debate
for the negative, showed — that

and that the adoption of a national
amendment would be an open violation
of state's rights. The rejoinders were
especially forceful and contained much
“ne ”

The judges. Messrs. Vreeland and
Davis, of Charlotte, and Ariel. of
Mooresville, decided unanimously in fa-
vor of the negative. “They also decided
that the medal given by the Phi Society
should go to D. M. Chalmers, and that
af the Eu Society should go to Wm.
Love.
