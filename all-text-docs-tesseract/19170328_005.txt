i$ IT NECESSARY?

*

Altho the United States seems to be
on the verge of a war with Germany, or
perhaps a state of war already exists, 1
ask why should this be a time for hys-
teria, for a wholesale and superficial
training of American citizens to bear
arms? The preparedness movement.
augmented by the war scare, has spread
like wildfire all over our country, into
all our educational institutions, and now
the students of Davidson College are
urged to learn to shoot straight and to
drill and train so that we may do our
share to prevent our country from. be-
ing swamped by Teutonic hordes. Even
tho I appear as “a voice crying in the
wilderness,” 1 ask, “Is it necessary?”

Ever since the beginning of the Fu-
ropean struggle, the utter unprepared-
ness of the United States has been
preached thruout the land by a military
satrapv, by the war traffickers, and by a
parasite press. After seeing such. pic-
tures as “The Battle Cry of Peace.”
and reading the stirring articles of the
militarists, we have been expecting on
any morning to arise and see our land
swarming with Germans or Japs, all
bent on making the United States a part
of their dominions. And now, with
danger evidently nearer at least. we are
told that immediately on the breaking
out of hostilities ive are to be invaded
by an immense army, while the —sub-
blow — up
everything from the oyster beds of the
Carolina coast to the skyscrapers of New
York. So the students of this country
must be prepared, we must have military
training, and some would even compel
us to train.

The German Kaiser has pushed his
troops into France, where they have
compulsory: military service: into Rus-
sia, where they also have this system;
hut he has not put a single soldier on
English soil, tho he has been fighting
nearly three years, and he stands today
gaving across the channel at the white
cliffs of Dover with the same impotent
envy as did his prototype, Napoleon, a
little over a century ago. The English
youths, a ‘few miles away from she
enemy, are vet to have the patriotic task
nf shooting Germans in the British Isles.
and yet young Americans, thousands of
miles away, must he trained to shoot, so
that they can pull down with accuracy
the multifarious Germans as they rav-
age our country anywhere from ten to
twentv days after the breaking out of
hostilities.

How manv troops has Germany land-
ad on the Russian coast, tho she has a
fleet four times as large and is only a
lav’s run awav? How many soldiers
have the Allies placed on the neighbor-
‘ng German coast, tho they have a flect
four times the size of Germanv’s? The
conclusion is obvious. Our defense in
he war with Germany must be a strong
‘eet. backed un with powerful coast
fortifications, mines, and — submarines.

ad not a large and unwieldly mass of
“citizenry.” hastily trained. Gen. Nel-
an A. Miles, the Spanish War hero
chose knowledge of what he sneaks can
sat be questioned, savs that “the placine
if an army on American soil is the las:

thing any European government would
attempt. It could never be re-em-
barked.”

No military expert has said we are
to send a body of troops to the European
trenches. Our part in the war will be
naval and financial. The military ex-
pert of the London Times says: “The
direct military intervention of the Unit-
ed States in the war in Europe is not
practicable, even if America were to de-
sire it.” Japan has been in the war two
vears, and 1 ask the militarists to tell us
how many Japanese troops are fighting
in Europe today, and how many Ger-
mans are running wild over Japan, or
are even present in that country?

In view of these facts, I ask, Is it nec-
essary to militarize Davidson College.
and the other institutions of this coun-
try, and to foist upon the United States
a system of preparedness whose tragic
failure cries to heaven today from a
thousand battlefields of carnage with
bloody notes of warning to all people?
The large number (?) of students who
remained after chapel Monday morning
to organize a military company at. Dav-
idson may be some indication of how we
stand on the matter. Let us hope so.

“COMMON SENSE.”

LET'S GET TOGETHER.

The Student Council. its activities
and inactivities, and the eflicacy of stu-
dent government as a whole, have of fate
been subjects of much discussion, both
verbal and written, In fidding to this
discussion | realize the vital importance
of strong student self-government to the
life of the college. Some of the points
I wish to make are: If the “crisis” is
acute eneugh to merit a change in the
constitution, then let the full extent of
the crisis he understood by tlie whole
student body ; again, let. the student body,
having discussed the matter thoroly, in
student body meetings, make what
changes are necessary. “This will enable
all sides of the question to be brought
out. In making this discussion [Tam
speaking entirely as an individual mem-
ber of the student body.

Chambliss, in his article in last week's
Forum, gave his reason for the present
“crisis” and suggestions for remedving
these evils. He mentioned three “facts”
resulting from the “trial last | week :”
Kirst, that “men who were clearly guil
tv of drinking were practically dismisse |
by being given the slightest punishment
possible; secondly, that a Freshman wa
not punished even tho he showed con
tempt for the highest hody in student
life here; thirdly, that not only was this
Freshman permitted to publicly tell how
he horsed the council, but that council-
men themselves spread a report of the
council's disgrace around the campus.”

Chambliss, to say the least, gives th~
impression that he is fully acquainted
with all the facts.in the case How he
is able to give this information as. facts
1 do not know. If he got it from the
“Freshman” this of course cannot ex-
plain all the “facts” satisfactorily. If
he got it from “councilmen themcel ves.”
it seems only fair to the student body
that he make known the name or name
af his informants, so that the “facts”
can be authenticated.

The “case” as brought out in th

ing occurs on the Davidson College
campus, except during such events as
Senior and Junior Oratoricals and Com-
mencement, we naturally conclude that
it occurred at Junior, Speaking. An
outsider who reads this paper will cer-
tainly get a wrong impression if he
thinks that Davidson is a place where
any large amount of “drinking” takes
place. Another thing we all realize is
that the cause or occasion of drinking at
these events is that some alumni come
back to celebrate well supplied with
booze. So I remark in passing that these
alumni can largely do away with the
little drinking that occurs here by ob-
serving the “bone dry” law when they
return to college. However, if any stu-
dents broke the “moral code” at that
time, and it was plainly shown that they
did so, I do not believe that the student
body would reverse any reasonable de-
cision on the part of the Student Coun-
cil. Udo not propose to decide the ques-
tion of “repeated drunkenness.” How-
ever, the dictionary definition was, [ be-
lieve, the one that the framers of the
constitution had in’ mind when the
“moral code” was instituted. If the
Faculty will give us a more specific defi-
nition, all well and good. Otherwise
we ought to bring out all sides of the
question before any change is made.

T would make this point clear that in
whatever manner we mav change the

article concerned “drinking,” and as it
is a current fact that little or no drink-
