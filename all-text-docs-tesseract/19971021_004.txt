Saintsing’s resolution met by stiff opposition

In addition, Thrower said that there have been no
formal complaints made in regard to the escort service
this year.

“In past years there have been rumors of poor
service, and we pulled tapes from the. Charlotte-
Mecklenburg supervisor of communication,” he said.
“There was no evidence that there was a problem.”

Regardless, “I introduced these two resolutions
tonight to start a trend,” Saintsing said. :

but ones that are accurate and accomplish a goal,”
Dervan said.

Brown said she felt Saintsing could have gone
about accomplishing his goal in a better way: “I
thought it would be best to bring a resolution to the
body to redirect or restructure the way SGA is run.
SGA could have debated the merit of working through
resolutions as a rule.”

SGA President Buster Burke broke the tie to
pass the resolution on campus safety.

“[’m glad Tim’s got the initiative, but I think he
should have looked into it more,” Burke said.

The SGA’s committees and councils numbered
18 as of SGA Day and the ad-hoc committee on
minors has been added since.

“T think that any time a constituent has concerns,
the SGA is a great place to do it, “* SGA vice president
Ann Harriot Fisher said. “SGA has an encompassing
committee system that embraces many areas on cam-
pus.

“Heather and Lucian are the council chairper-
sons, and this could have been resolved through them,
but I think the way Tim handled it was entirely
appropriate. His constituent had a problem, and this
is the way he sought to solve it best. The way a senator
wishes to vent his constituents’ concerns is up to him.”

“I agree that it’s important to bring resolutions,

re

Maybe this will make the SGA a better organization,
but I don’t want resolutions to be accusatory or to
damage the rapport of SGA committees.”

“There Were many routes that I could have cho-
sen to present my resolutions,” Saintsing said. “The
one I chose is the one that best suited the current
situation. The committee structure has a lot of poten-
tial, but I cannot work within a flawed system to
correct that very system.”

“Not everyone will be willing to fix the SGA. My
enthusiasm and initiative will be met with hostility
and defense,” he said.

“But lam willing and ready to change the system
so that it best addresses students’ needs and so that it
best utilizes the framework that is already in place.”

BSC lobbies for equality on campus

25 Years Ago fx
This Week fg

By Laura CRAVER
Staff Writer

filled its pages with commentar-

ies on and accounts of the heated,
ominous presidential election between
Democratic hopeful George
McGovern and the hard-nosed Re-
publican champion Richard Nixon.

Students praised Nixon in edito-
tials, while others aligned support for
McGovern. The Davidsonian reported
that the College Democrats were wag-

.ing their own personal campaign for
the challenger, just as the College Re-
publicans mustered support for the
incumbent.

Although this election left a sub-
stantial mark on American political
history, the election of Nixon in 1972
is 25 years old in textbooks.

le October 1972, the Davidsonian

However, the Davidsonian chose
a different story for the front page, one
that continues to affect the student popu-
lation at Davidson. The week of Oct.
20, the Black Student Coalition made
10 proposals to the Faculty Executive
Committee.

The BSC, led by president Ron
Gibson, punctuated their petition with
threats of refusing to help recruit black
students in the future and their own
likely withdrawal from the College if
positive action was not taken to allevi-
ate the problems.

Among the 10 proposals were as
follows: an increase in black student
enrollment to “at least 150 within two
years,” -an-African-Studies Program,
“several black faculty members within
two years,” a better social life for black
students, and the appointment of two
black administrators within the year.

Also, the BSC wanted 10 percent of the
Coed students to be black. At the time of
the complaints in 1972, there were none.

Gibson claimed little was done
over the summer to implement these
proposals, some of which had been pro-
posed in earlier years.

As a result, the BSC decided on
deadlines to draw attention to their con-
cerns.

“If Davidson cannot make.a real
commitment to black students, then
there is no need for us to be here,”
Gibson said.

“Some of these proposals include
things that were promised to us my
freshman year, but they have not been
acted on. We are tired of empty prom-
ises. We want action.”

Students. and faculty members
sympathized with the arguments. But
John M. Bevan, the vice-president for

academic affairs, disputed Gibson’s
assertion that nothing had been done
to improve the “situation.”

He cited the hiring of a black
admissions officer and another black
secretary, and a comprehensive re-
view of the library’s holdings about
the “black experience.”

Furthermore, Gibson and others
petitioned for an exchange program
with traditionally black colleges. At
the time, Howard University and
Morehouse College had exchange pro-
grams with predominately white
Northern colleges.

Today minority students benefit
from such Davidson-sponsored pro-
grams as A.C.E.S.,COSEN, and BSC.

Also, Davidson succeeded in es-
tablishing exchange- programs with
Morehouse College and Howard Uni-
versity.
