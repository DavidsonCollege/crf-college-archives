Each time I hear the college bell
ringing in the morning I think
ffl vor a similar bell

al n Germany ring-
ng for the similar
reason: to pull
the poor students

- *4 out of Morpheus’

arms to put them

back into. rough
os reality, What the
; bell is concerning
# P4 ry there seems to be

no difterence between the Ameri-
can and the German school sys.
tems. But bells generally are not
main points except when. announc-
ing the end of a period. ,

Besides this remarkable confir-
mity, however, the German school
system ‘is very different -from the
American one. The child enters
grammar school at the age of 6
years, Like America he is taught
basic knowledge — how to ‘read,
to write and to count. Grammar
schoo! education in general lasts
8 years. At the age of I4, the time
it will be confirmed, the child leaves
grammar school and starts training
for his vocation, for example lock-
smith or carpenter, About 80 per.
cent of. all German children receive
this education. The other 20 percent
attend highschool. They leave
grammar schoo! after the fourth
grade and change to either high-
or middleschool. Highschool edu.
cation requfred for university, lasts
9 years; middleschool education,
not sufficient for university,
years..

Coming back to highschool we
find two main types of which one
is called the humanistic branch the
other the realistic branch. Both dif-
ter in their courses of instruction:
the humanistic branch includes the
Greek language, the realistic branch
may be considered to be more scien-
tific, Which makes it the far more
important type of highschooi. Pu-
pils attending: highschool are not
able to choose their courses but
have to take all courses taught for
that certain grade. The courses at
the realistic, branch of highschool
are: 9 years of German, English,
mathematics, geography, biology,
history, religion, sports, musics, and
fine arts; 6 years of Latin, 5 years
of physics and 4 years of French,
chemistry and political affairs. Hav-
ing finished all 9 years you have
to pass a final examination in all
courses, called the “Abitur.” This
exaniination is regarded to be the
most difficult one a German stu-
dent ever has to pass. You may
pass it with 1, 2, 3, which would
be the same as A, B, C, but univer-
sities these years required A or B
for admission,

In Germany you will not find
any institute comparable to the
American college. Having graduat-
ed from highschool you arrive at
somewhat the same point in your
education as a senior graduating
from college. As I know some
American universities before the
war uséd to give 4 years credit to
a German student having graduated
from highschool.

In spite of ‘this good education
the German schoolsystem has a
principal disadvantage. Only 20 per
cent of the German youth attends
highschool.

During the last years several
plans have been made in order to
change this fact, and some may be
carried out this fall, but about this
subject I would like to talk the
next time.

Executive Committee
Alters Auto Rules
For Trial Period

Thursday, during the Chapel
hour, Dean J. C. Bailey announced
to the student body that major
changes: had been made by the
Executive Committee concerning
the car regulations at Davidson.

Dean Bailey explained the re-
vised regulations to the students
and emphasized the point that the
following rules are in effect on an

experimental basis. The regulations
are as follows:

1. Quring the period beginniig
on October 4, 1949, such restric
tions as aréjhow in force with ref.

erence to the bringing of motor ve-
hicles to Davidson and the using
of such vehicles by students shall
be suspended, except as is provided
in the subsequent sections of this
paper. The suspending of these re-
strictions is to be regarded as an
experiment;-if the results are fav-
orable, the~ period during which
the restrictions ave suspended may
be extended; if the results are un-
favorable, the Facufty will impose
whatever restrictions may seem
best suited to the situation.

2. Students are prohibited from
keeping or using on the campus
(a) motorcycles, motorbikes, scoot-
ers, and all similar types of ve-
hicles, and (b) cars which make so
much noise that they attract atten-
tion and constitute a nuisance,

3. Students who bring cars to
the campus will be expected to
park their cars in the areas desig-
nated by the Dean of Students and
the Faculty Committee en Build.
ings and Grounds. Students who
fail to park their cars in the desig-
nated areas shal} be subject to a
fine of five dollars or the loss of
car privileges or both.

4. The Faculty reserves the right
to impose restrictions at any time
upon any individual student or up-
on the student body as a whole if

GYAINASIUE: READE:C :OR HOMECOMING

To Visit Davidson

On Monday the student body
will hear a “male war bride’. He
is Mr. Robert Smith, who at pres-
ent is the Dean of Music at Flora
McDonald: College. Mr. Smith will
be here to give Davidson gentle-
men a glance at the musical cul-
ture of Scotland.

Mr. Smith’s musical experience
began at the age of 16, when he
was appointed organist and choir
director of the, North Parish
Church in his native Scotland, He
later received his Licentia (degree)
in organ and piano at the Royal
Academy of Music in London and
from there went to Saint Andrews
University on a Carnegie Scholar.

mixed-voice choirs and junior
choirs, he has received twenty-six
first premier awards in choral com-
petition in Great Britain.

During the ‘war Mr. Smith serv-
ed with the famed British Eighth
Army tank corps in North Africa,
Sicily, and Italy. During this time,
he met an American Army Nurse,
Sara Fussell, wliom he married and
returned with her to her ‘home in
Jacksonville, ‘Florida, as soon as
their army duties were completed.
In Jacksonville Mr. Smith acted as
director of music at Robert E. Lee

Every year when final exams end
most of the Davidson students set
out for three months of frivolty.
Some get jobs and horde up vast
sums of money so that they can re-
turn to school the next year and
have their frivolity then. Still oth-
ers come to Summer school in or-
der to get a better education and
better equip themselves for future
life. Then, too, there are those who

.are completing their college course

and who will soon receive their
diplomas.
All of them may be looked upon

as the fortunates when June rolls

around. But there is another group

“You're On Your Own Time”

of which, though it may be small,
is indeed less fortunate. This group
consists of those who face six weeks
at Ft. Benning, Ga., with absolute.
ly none of the above mentioned ad-
vantage. Certainly they will have
no frivolity; the few pennies which
they will receive would not keep
the skinniest in drink; they will
receive no education to aid them,

Davidson’s new — gymnasium,
which will be ready for student
use by Oct. 22, will house facilities
for eight, sports: basketball, hand-
ball, volleyball, badminton, wrest.
ling, boxing, swimniing, and weight
lifting. Offtier than the rooms that
will be used for these sports, the

auxiliary gym, special team rooms,
and locker and shower rooms ar-
ranged separately for the students,
the coaches, and the faculty.

On the main floor of the gym
will be three basketball courts,
eight badminton. courts, three vol-
leyball courts, and two one-wall
handball courts. The main basket-
ball floor will be flanked by tele-
scoping bleachers that can be
pushed against the walt when not

modaté those interested in boxing
and wrestling, while the basement,
or locker-room floor, will hold a

Last June some fifty of the brave
souls left the campus led by the
gallant General Tube and his adju-
tant, Colonel Badknee. They were
met by a warm welconting commit-
tee but the crafty general saw
through it and warned his men
against falling for any false niee-

The Tube was right hecause it

This week, Unity Charch, where
many Davidson College students
have found a church home during
their school years, will officially
become a member of the Concord
Presbytery of the Southern Pres-
byterian Church as the Calvary
Presbyterian Church.

In 1893, John P. MunrGe, then
well known physician and president
of the Davidson Cotton Mill, saw

program by his employees who
were not being reached by the town
church, and established a Sunday
Schcol and erected a church build-
ing on the present site. The David-
son Presbyterian Church supplied
workers for this Sunday School,
until. the local Methedist Church
was established, at this time the
Sunday School was discontinued,

round of indictments concerning
freshmen who have violated regu.
lations. His Honor reminded the
freshmen of the weekly meeting of
the Court at Phi Hall Thursday

conduct of the freshnien and cited
a general obnoxiousness in liew of
trying to catch the true Davidson
spirit. He expressed his. displeas-
ure with the lack of attention which
the freshmen paid to keeping the
campus. The Judge also desires
that all freshmen know that if. it
is impossible for the court to hold
a meeting in chapel on Wednes-
day, they will be notified by mail of
their expectance to attend the reg-
ular meeting of the Court on Thurs-
day night, In corijunction with this
measure he said‘ that ignorance
would be no excuse, for the cards
will be mailed in plenty of time.

The fotlowing freshmen are re-
quired to attend the meeting of
the Court this week:

1. Bob Henry: disturbing upper-
classmen by. singing in shower. 2.!
John Alexander; no name plate,
refusal to go to Stud for upper-
classmen, general obnoxiousness.

3. Arnold Whisnant: ignorance
of freshman regulations, hiding in
closet during pep meeting, break-
ing campus, threatening to “buy
off’ a member of the Court of Con-
trol.

4. Harold Jennings: breaking |
campus, refusal to keep an appoint-
ment with an upperclassman; lying |
to an upperclassman.

5. John Ottley: no freslisnan cap.

At the U. S. Army rest camp the
men were not exposed to such
things as John Health beating on
the door at 7:30 in the morning and
pulling them out of bed. Instead
they were quietly aroused each
morning at 5:30 by a sweet talk-
ing sergeant who turned on the
tights and quoted sweet poetry.

After five long minutes the men
happily ran out into the company
street for reveille. Of course tlic
prompt General Tube was always
leading his men. With the roll caj
complete the soldiers  casualfy
strolled down to their excquisi:
dining room where their orders
were taken by newt, white coated
waiters.

Upon finishing a wholesome
breakfast all returned to the bur
racks to find their beds neatly
made and the floor swept. This lefi
plenty of time for letting the break
fast settle before boarding the
comfortable buses for a pleasanc
trip to an air conditioned theater
for the morning's instruction.
