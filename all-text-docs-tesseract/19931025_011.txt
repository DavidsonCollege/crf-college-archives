Theater department tackles psychological drama Equus

’ By Jacob Abraham &
Allison Wright
Alan Strang seems to be just
another teenager dealing with typi-
cal teenage frustrations. He has a
pair of loving parents, a girlfriend,
and a job caring for the horses at a
local stable. What would possess
such a seemingly normal, well-
adjusted young man to sneak into
the stable one night and savagely
blind six horses?
Such is the quandary which
faces Dr. Dysart in the theater
\department’s fall production of

Equus, running from Tuesday to
Sunday. Miles Mowry plays the
child psychologist who is trying to
get inside Alan’s head and cure all
his problems.

In the process of psychoana-
lyzing Alan (played by Adam
Knapp), Dysart must trace the sig-
nificant events in Alan’s past that
led upto this brutal act of violence.
As he studies Alan, Dysart must
come to grips with his profession
and the power he wields to change,
and perhaps destroy, the unique
perspectives of his patients.

At the same. time, he must
somehow help Alan deal with his
own sexuality and his strange ob-
session with horses. Andrew
Smitherman and Rachel Hall play
Alan’s parents, whom Dysart con-
sults to try to piece together Alan’s
childhood. Jennifer Don plays Jill,
the girl who is drawn to Alan and
who is instrumental in his sexual
awakening.

The other important charac-
ters in the play are the horses, which
are symbolically represented on
stage. Ledby the main horse called

Nugget (played by Edwin Tho-
mas), the horses move about on
Stage wearing metallic horse-head
masks and stilt-like horseshoes.
The members of the cast remain on
stage throughout the play, some-
times serving as an on-stage part of
the audience; they also work as
stage hands and jury members.

The simple-looking stage
functions as Dr. Dysart’s study and
the stable area, among other set-
tings; a rotating circular stage is
also employed to create a special
effect in one scene.

Some controversy has sur-
rounded Peter Shaffer’s play in the
past. Along with the play’s com-
plex and mature themes,
Davidson’s production will include
a nude sex scene towards the end
of the play.

While lighting effects will be
used to make the nudity less overt,
the play does seem to be aimed
towards a mature audience.
Whether or not the play sparks
controversy, Equus promises to be
a thought-provoking psychologi-
cal drama.

The last of
the singing
cowboys

By Geoff Graham

The evolution of Country, or
any musical genre, is as inevitable
as the passing of time itself. The
Country and Western of the forties
and fifties lent itself, slowly but
surely, to the rock, pop and coun-
try blend we hear today. “Coal
Miner’s Daughter” and “Railroad
Lady” gave way to such modern
day hits as “Homesick” and “We
Shall Be Free.”

There’s no good or bad in this.
We can condemn or praise all we
want, but in the end, we must ac-
cept the change as unavoidable. A
few old timers still hang on, but
their numbers are dwindling. Like
the cowboys of their inspiration,
they’re a dying breed.

One such singing cowboy is
Don Edwards. Goin’ Back to
Texas, his second album, pays trib-

ute to the Old West of his child-.

hood,
The elderly guitarist moans
elegy after elegy, lamenting not
only the passing of the lonely cow-
boy, but the passing of the prairie
wilderness as well.

You’ve never heard him on
the radio, for he no longer fits the
country mold, but nevertheless, all
his songs sound familiar. They all
yearn for a past which, as children,
weall dreamed of, yet never could
touch.

Did you give a heart rebel yell
at the end of The Outlaw Josie
Wales? Did you want Silveradoto
goon forever? Did you wipe tears
from your eyes on the last page of
Lonesome Dove? | did.

If you feel the same way I do,
come by and listen to Don Edwards.
You'll enjoy it. In today’s world,
where the longhorns, outlaws, and
red wolves have all but vanished,
this aged cowboy hangs on as the
last of an ancient and dying breed.
In “Say Goodbye to Montana,” the
old coyote sings, “All honor to the
cowboy/Your praises they will
sing/ For you never sold your
saddle/That’s the most important
thing.”

Don Edwards has yet to sell
his saddle, and as long as he keeps
playing, our heroes will always be
cowboys.

Spooky "things"

Is there a ghost in the
Hardin House?

\

By Towner Blackstock

The Harding House sits between the Ad-
missions Building and Careers House on North
Main Street. For many years home to a
Classics professor and his wife, the residence
now houses single Davidson professors. The
unpretentious structure easily goes unnoticed
by most passers-by.

But perhaps there’s more to the Harding
House than meets the eye. If we are to believe
rumor, there’s something up there. If we are
to believe the experience of two former
Davidson professors, there’s a ghost in the
Harding House. Old houses are strange things,
to be sure, and often have strange noises, odd
occurrences, and so on. But might there be
something more?

Dr. Bonnie Marshall taught Russian here
until just last year. Fora while, she lived in the
upstairs of Harding House, although not quite
comfortably.’ When she first arrived, the en-
tire room was covered in a black soot, appar-
ently from an old furnace duct. After four
attempts of her own toclean it anda few more
by physical plant workers, they finally painted
over the: mess. A minor inconvenience, to be
sure, but then there was the door. Every day

_when she returned from class, the door that
she had locked securely in the morning stood
ajar. After a great deal of fuss, the physical
plant re-hung the door frame, which took care
of that problem...for the most part. The stub-
born door still came ajar a few more times
during her stay. If this all wasn’t enough, a
certain spot in the hall constantly remained
“freezing cold...it didn’t matter what time of
the year it was.” Even in summer heat this
cold spot sent shivers down spines.

To add to her troubles, our berated pro-
fessor returned once to her apartment to find

a large puddle of water on the floor of her
study. After mopping it up, she went into the
kitchen, where another puddle of water cov-
ered most of the floor. Maybe the roof leaked?
No, there were no stains in the ceilings or on
the walls, or any apparent other sources of
leaking.

Then there were the noises. Dr. Marshall
got used to the “very pronounced” sounds of
someone stepping across the attic floor, of
water running, and even banging. Yes, old
houses can creak and moan, but this proved a
little too much, enough to be annoying. Per-
haps squirrels, or birds? That doesn’t explain
the furnace. Shortly after her moving in,
several physical plant workers placed in the
attic a new furnace, which took most of the
afternoon just to get up there. The men left,
planning to install it the next day. That night,
Dr. Marshall heard a huge crash directly over-
head, much to her distress. In the morning, the
workmen arrived to discover, much to their

dismay, that the furnace had fallen on its side
in the attic right over Dr. Marshall’s bed. Yet
they could not explain how such an enor-
mously heavy, not to mention stable piece of
machinery had just turned over!

Later in the year, Marshall invited another
professor, Dr. Becky Marcon of the Psychol-
ogy Department, over for dinner. After eating,
they sat talking, and began discussing femi-
nism and religion. Atthis point, the noises that
constantly pervaded the house seemed to grow
louder. “Just ignore them,” said Dr. Marshall,
pointing out that these noises happened all the
time, and that she “refused to let these get to
me.”

The footsteps in the attic, the “huge bang-
ing sounds,” and the running water noises all
grew to the point of interrupting their conver-
sation. Suddenly, the smoke alarm in the
ceiling directly above the stairwell fell and

Garth Brooks offers a priceless performance

By Joanne Griffiths and
Lisa Knox

How many people do you
know that would pay $170 forthree
and a half hours of pure excite-
ment? We did! No, this is not
about a bargain hunter’s indecent
proposal, but rather two nights,
October 1 and October 2, of drool-
ing over THE man of country mu-
sic: Garth Brooks.

Unfortunately, the opening
act, Stephanie Davis, was less than
impressive. The only song worth
mentioning was her attempted ren-
dition of Garth’s “Learning to Live
Again” to which she did no justice.

Her mild "success" could be
measured by the enormous num-
ber of empty seats inside the coli-
seum compared tothe packed lobby
of fans standing in lines for Garth
paraphernalia.

Our high cost, high class tick-
ets enabled us to get a superb view
of Garth in his second-skin Wran-
glers as he opened the show rising
from below the stage with “Stand-
ing Outside the Fire,” an intoxicat-
ing number from his latest release
In Pieces. After such an outstand-
ing opening, he continued to whip
the crowd into a frenzy with such
boot-stomping favorites as
“Shameless,” “Friends in Low

Places,” “Rodeo,” and “That Sum-
mer.” His slower songs were
equally well-received with the
crowd drawing out their lighters
for “The River” and “Unanswered
Prayers.”

Tribute was paid during the
second concert to the Kulwicki
and Allison families during “The
Dance” for the deaths of the two
car-racing greats killed earlier this
year.

WTDR distributed flashlights
to the crowd upon entry to shine
during the song.

The second night was packed
with even more energy than the
first. Garth delivered a stellar show

outlasting the previous night’s by
forty-five minutes. During his sec-
ond encore, Garth claimed he was
having such a good time that he
wasn’t quite ready to leave and
stayed on to please the crowd with
four additional songs, including
“If Tomorrow Never Comes.”
Garth’s personable perfor-
mance left a good number of his
fans speechless. As sophomore
Addria Capps put it, “What can
you say? It was Garth Brooks!”
Looking back on our expen-
sive weekend, we have come toa
decision: our lives are better left to
chance, we could have kept our
money, but we’d have had to miss
