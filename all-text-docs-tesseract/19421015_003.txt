Renewal of Old Rivalry

When the Wildcats engage Georgia Tech at Grant Field
in Atlanta Saturday it will be a renewal‘of an old rivalry dating
back to 1900. The two schools He met eleven times on the
gridiron, the last contest being played in 1922 with the Ram-
blin’ Wrecks triumphing by 19-0. In all, the Cats defeated the
Techs three times (the first three games of the series) and
lost the remaining eight games to their more powerful oppo
nents.

In renewing this series with Tech, the ’Cats,
uable to break into the winning or scoring columns
this season, find themselves up against one of the most
formidable foes in the nation. The Engineers are un-
defeated, boast victories over powerful Auburn and one
of Notre Dame’s best teams in years; they were rated
fourth in the nation by the Williamson system last
week. In short Bill Alexander’s boys. are riding high,
and they may not be-expected to let up for the little
Davidsons, with a homecoming crowd on hand to be
impressed.

In view of these hard facets it might be expected that

the Wildeats are taking that long trip just for the. ride
and a taste of deep-southern, municipal. hospitality. That
is not the case. Davidson teams are not built that way. This

year’s team has played some good football and a good bit not
so good, but they showed their possibilities against State as
well as on other isolated occasions. They are itching for a
touchdown, and it could come at Ga. Tech's expense as it has at
Duke’s on numerous occasions. Anyway, although you need
not look for a victory Saturday or even a-close score, you can
count on the boys getting in some good, licks before the final
whistle. :
Bethea Boots ’Em
A bright spot looms out of the otherwise gloomy
scene in the Davidson football picture: Red Bethea’s
kicking in the two games in which he has participated.
Big Red's play last season was so outstanding that
sports writers placed him on the All-American check
list for this year, along with;-Herb Rainey, the ’Cats’
reliable, veteran lineman. Bethea came to us from
Dillon, S.°'C., via Woodberry Forest. After doing
yeoman’s service on the yéarling team, he moved into
the starting lineup on the varsity last year. His kick-
ing for the season averaged 47 yards. Hardly less
notable was his performance at backing up the thin
red-line-where he broke through time after time to
throw opposing backs for losses. His blocking was
vicious. It was a shame for such a player to be in-
jured before the season started. Red’s tackling and
blocking have been missed and probably will be missed
for some time because of his weak collar-bone. But
he is back in there kicking with amazing consistency.
Earle averaged better than 41 yards in his initial appear-
ance against Rollins. In the V.P.1. game he kicked 8 times
for an average of 47 yards, including one blocked kick. ‘Two
of his boots went tor 70 yards. That is kicking! “Bonnie Ben”

$

Washburn added his bit to the average ‘in placing two kicks, @

total of 95 yards. down the field.

A More Odds and Ends
At Slacksburg last Saturday it was simply a

story of too much V.P.I. power in the line. The
’Cat forwards repeatedly held the Gobblers short of
the goal line even though they were vulnerable in
midfield. But the Davidson line was unable to out-
charge the larger opponents on offense, and the backs
never had a chance to get started. with a running or
passing attack. ...

The Frosh had an easy time of it in disposing of P.J.C.,
but their play left much to be desired. They will definitely
have their hands full tomorrow in their game with the-Carolina
Yar Babies. Reports have it that the U.N.C. frosh line aver-
ages 201 pounds... but the bigger they come, ete. So go get
‘em, Kittens. ;

South Carolina continues. the cry for freshman
participation in varsity conference games; however, :

it is unlikely that any action will be taken wth the

big boys opposed to it (including Davidson) ... Tech

will probably play some frosh against the ’Cats.. .

Bruce and Rainey, both suffering from leg injuries,

will probably see only limited action this week... .

O’Hair complicated his ankle trouble in the game

last week, but should be ready for plenty of action...

Congrats to the non-frat-men-for organizing a touch team
to compete with the Greeks. ... This team will not be eligible
for. the cup, but their addition to the schedule gives ati outlet
in intramurals to many formerly left out upon completion of

the class games....

VETERAN LINEMAN

Herb Rainey has been a steady lineman for three years. Originally
a guard, he has been moved over one slot to fill a gaping hole at tackle this
year. One of two Davidson players on the sports writers All-America
check list, he has continued to play outstanding ball this year. His in-
action last week due to injury was sorely felt.
