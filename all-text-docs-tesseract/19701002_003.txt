A speed reading course ap-

Dean .Frontis W-. Johnston.

_The optimum size for such

“I hope there will be some

The course ‘eonsists of
eight weekly sessions of two
and a half hours each.

It costs’ $125, ‘but guaran-

‘does not triple his speed as
a result of the course.
"The skill tayght in the

from a standpoint of per-

Coble went on to describe
thé speakers as being rather
patterned. ‘The , general
pattern was to start off

way through-chey started to
speak out against vivlence
and to emphasize the i m-

“The most interesting
speaker was Curtis Tarr
(Director of the Selective

college president. He at-

tempted ¢o explain his de- |

an all volunteer army and
the removal of deferments

specifically to the amend.
ment of that act giving
eighteen-year-olds the right
to vote after January lst,
which is now being tested in
the courts.

He expressed optimism
that the act would be upheld
and that. eighteen-year-olds
would be enfranchised.

The.result is the predic-
tion that almost twenty per-
cent of the American voters
who will vote in 1973 did not
vote in 1968.

Jackson observed _ that
even if only eleven percent
of ‘the new voters chose
moderate dovish candidates,
it would still make a defi-
nite impact on ‘the outcome.

Jackson concluded by
mentioning several local
candidates that the move-

podium and outlined the ap-

in the local campaigns. He
said that this would consist

ly,

By ROBERT TOUCHTON

In response to requests
from the ‘college administra-
tion, approximately 10 Da-
vidson students have volun-
teered to drive school buses
for the busing-stricken Char
lotte-Mecklenburg County
School ‘District.

After two weeks of class-
es, 16 Davidson students had
indicated an interest in driv-
ing buses and 10 began
training Tuesday.

Several freshmen applied,
they were advised
against burdening them
selves too heavily: their first

term at Davidson.

Peter H. Hobbie, assistant
to college president Samuel
R. Spencer Jr., who was in
charge of the drive to get
bus drivers; told THE DA-
VIDSONIAN that he was
very happy with the re-
sponse,

Hobbie further said that
those students driving buses
were performing what is
virtually a public service
since driving requires about
four hours (6, a.m. to 10 a.m.
or 1 p.m. to 5p.m.) and stu-
dents are not paid for their
travel time to and
