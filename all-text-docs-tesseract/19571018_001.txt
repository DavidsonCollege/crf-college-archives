Jones Lashes
Present Setup

In chapel yesterday, Bob Jones, President of the
IFC, gave his critique of Davidson's fraternity system.

He began his speech with the
assertion that a fraternity sys-
tem should further the aims of
the college at which it is lo-
eated. With this basis he sur-

Why Fraternity?

See Editorial on Page Two

veyed several aspects of Da-
vidson’s fraternity set up.

The first point he stressed
dealt with the disproportionate
power of the fraternities due to
the large percentage of mem-
bership. This could be resolved,
he felt, with a larger and
stronger independent group.

He next criticized the current
“survival of the fittest” com-
petition among the fraternities,
stressing that in such an un-
balance of strength the healthy
competition which strengthens
a fraternity is prohibited.

Rush week needed some defi-
nite correction he said. His per-
sonal preference was for a rush
week combined with orienta-

tion similar to the practice of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.

His forth point concerned the
enormous size of some fraterni-
ties. He suggested as an alterna-
tive to the present emphasis of
quantity of members a program
that would emphasize quality.
This basically was an arrange-
ment for preferential bidding
and a quota pledging system.

A final point was that of Hell
Week. The present practices, he
stated, were as inefficient a
method of producing unity in
the fraternity and pledge class
as possible. In addition he point-
ed out that Hell Week has been
strongly condemned by the Na-
tional Interfraternity Confer-
ence and by every national fra-
ternity.

In concluding he stressed
that although some of his ideas
might seem radical and new, in
reality they comprised a basical-
ly conservative program de-
signe to make Davidson’s fra-
ternity system more effective.

‘Cumming Good

On Old Maps

BY GORDON LeGRAND
Davidsonian Feature Staff

Dr. William P. Cumming’s avocations. at least one
of them, are an-example of how an investigation under-
taken to satisfy an inquiring mind can lead to a position
of pre-eminence in that field.

' Dr, Cumming first became in-
iterested in early maps when.
on his honeymoon in England. '
he discovered a map of the east: ;
ern United States which showed
a large lake covering part of
North Carolina, South Carolina.
and Georgia. The same map
also. showed a_ great desert
stretching across North and
South Carolina.

Looks For Desert

He began a study to deter-
mine the reason’ for the lake
and desert appearing where
they did. The results of this
research is a book edited by Dr.
Cumming entitled “The Discov-
1eries of John Lederer in Vir-
jginia and Carolina, 1672,"
which the Virginia press will
publish this November.

The map in the accompaning
, Picture is of the area around
Charles Town (South Carolina).
Drawn in 1696 by Sanson, the
first great scientific French
geographer. it contains a list of
j the 250 colonists settled there
,at the time.

,an individual.

Publishes Book

In January, 1958, the. Prince-
ton University Press will pub-
lish a book by Dr, Cumming,
“The Southeast In Early Maps.”
One critic has this to say about
the book: “Its value to the his-
tarian of geographical devetop-
ment and the historian of cartog-
raphy is great. and is unique
in character, because until now
nothing. of the sort has been
done for the Southeast.”

In additon to his array of
mups, Dr. Cumming has collect-
ed a variety of clocks. The one
pictured above was made by
Jerome and Darrow in 1824
This particular clock is of the
pillar and scroll design and has
all wooden works. The Profes
sor’s 20 clocks, most of which
are, in running condition, in-
clude thirty-hour clocks: seven.
fourteen, and twenty-one day
timepieces: and one four-hun-
dred day Swiss clock of the
nineteenth century which is
wound on New Year’s Day.

Collects Swords

The third field in whieh. Dr.
Cumming is an avid collector
is swords. He has swords of the.
early nineteenth. the  seven-
feenth century. and one. fif-
teenth century Japanesé sword
made by an expert in that coun-
try.

These three collections reveal
only a few .of the Humanities

College Church Gets
New Hymn Books

Students at the college vesper services will be sing-
ing from a new pan-Presbyterian hymnal, six hundred
and fifty copies of which have been placed this week
in the College Church.

Titled simply The Hymnbook,
the volume was produced in
1955 by the five major branches
of the Reformed faith in this
country — the Associate Re-
formed Presbyterian Church,
the Reformed Church in Ameri-
ca (Dutch), the United Presby-
terian Church, and the Presby-
terian Churches, U. S. and
U. S.A.

Members of the Department
of Music who have examined
the new hymnal point out that

are included.

it has nearly three times as
much resource material for ser-
vices of public worship as the
book which has been in use
for the past five years, and that
the musical setting of many
hymns is vastly superior to
those in the former hymnal.

Editor of The Hymnbook was
Dr. David Hugh Jones of Prince-
ton, and serving on the editorial
committee was W. Talliaferro
Thompson, '05.
