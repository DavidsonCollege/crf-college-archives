Widespread Panic

__. By Chris Hoveland

The release of Widespread
Panic’s second album,
Widespread Panic this July
undoubtedly stirred the
interest of Widespread fans
on campus and along the
east coast. Their second
effortcontains seventy-two
minutes of music, all digi-
tally mastered, complete
witha photo booklet. Wide-
spread Panic offers a new
sound compared to Space
Wrangler, although the
band has performed most,
if not all of the songs over
the last year. [know I joined
many others anxiously
waiting for the album’s re-
lease, but I can’t say my ex-
pectations were satisfied.

For most listeners the
album will comeasabitofashock.

anyone who has seen one of their
shows lately, will not be suprised:
the album is full of that patented
Widepread rhythm led by bassist
David Schools, and the growling

(and grating) vocals of John Bell.
Of the thirteen tracks, at least
three stand out as landmarks
in the maturity of the band.
“Pigeons” contains all the
elements of this sound -- a
catchy rhythm and bass line
to start, followed by an ex-
tended jam characterized
mainly by a simple series
of drawn-outchord changes
and drum rolls. “C.
Brown,” amelancholy tune
about the pathos of
Schultz’s hero, demon-
strates the potential power
’ of the band. “Barstools and
dreamers” fits right in the
Widespread mold, butnev-
ertheless is one of their bet-
ter endeavors.
Panic experi-
ments with a few new ideas
as well. A ballad called “Mercy”
is one that can safely be removed
from their repetoire. “Weight of
the World,” however, is an eye-
opener. True, it may not be what

Arts Essay: Lollapalooza in GA,

By WillMontgomery
Expectations were high for the
Lollapalooza tour’s stop at
Lakewood Amphitheaterin Atlanta
on August 18. In the car on the
way downtown I snidely com-
mented that “This is going to be a
freak show.” My friend Cliff
summed up the excitement when
he replied “I can’t wait.” Nine
hours and seven bands later we
were drained, numb, and euphoric
after the display of human diver-
sity and expression both by the
bands and the sold out crowd of
very interestingly clad humans.
The show was the idea of Perry
Ferrel, lead singer of Janes’s Ad-
diction, who visualised a cross-
over tour that brought progressive,
alternative, metal, art-rock and rap
music togehter, Bothacelebration
of diversity and individualism,
Lollapalooza affirmed the imagi-
native and creative spirit burning
brightly within the human soul.
The format of the show in-
cluded, in order of appearance, sets
by the Henry Rollins Band, led by
the former Black Flag singer who
screams/chants poetry to metal
rock, The Butthole Surfers, who I
missed most of to watch the street
performers in the concession area,
are a California surf-punk obnox-
ious humorous band. Most people
said that their show was quite good,
and better than the Henry Rollins

Band. A hint of what was tocome.

exploded in the next set by Ice-T,
thé Los Angeles rapper. He was
cutthroat, cutting edge and I slam
danced in the mosh pit for his en-
tire set. The addition to his band of
a thrash trio added guitar crash to
his street sound and songs such as

. “Qriginal Gangster”. and “Body
Count” rocked the predominantly
white crowd into a frenzy . The
“industrial rock” sound of Atlanta
band Nine Inch Nails carried the
energy of Ice-T’s set even further.
The gothic, technical-noise orches-
tration echoed Ice-T’s chaotic
urban prophesy with a cybernetic
Terminator, cuisinart, weed eater
edgetoit. Nextcame Living Color,
who were terrible. Vernon Reid’s
usually spectacular guitar sounded
sloppy and the singer’s voice was
too high pitched and screamy to
blend comfortably with Reid’s
expressionistic and jazzy but
somehow nervous and monotonous
wails. Siouxse and the Banshees
were a bit of a pause, a rest if you
will. Her melodic and disciplined
voice juxtaposed with the eerie
instrumentation expressed a para-
noid beauty. :

And, aah yes, Jane’s Addic-
tion. My favorite band since the
Clash destroyed my fear that suc-
cess had endangered their integ-
rity. Mountains of sound washed
in waves of power chords while
Perry Farrel’s laser beam voice cut
elegant scales out of some secret
warrior dimension.» A choreo-
graphed expression of lesbian sex
with two unbelievably hot strip-
pers during the song “Nothing's
Shocking” wasnice. Later, rapper
Ice-T took the stage to sing a duet
with Perry Ferrel. A white su-
premacist in the crowd was given
the microphone and the audience
heard a brief pro-white racist
comment before the microphone
was ripped out of his hand. Next,
Ferrel and Ice-T broke-into the
song “Don’t Call. Me Whitey,

Nigger.” If the essence of Lollapa-
looza could-be isolated, it was at
this point most clearly expressed.
Opinions exist and must be ex-
plored to be understood. Art helps
universalize the expression of these
ideas and through sharing art,
human life can be informed and
enriched. The final encore saw the
drummer from each of the seven
bands take the stage to bang on
enormous wooden bongos and
African drums. This jam called to
mind the universal human primal
urge to make music.and expanded
the sense of time and community
to the entire human race since the
stone age. I was dancing like a
freak by this point.

Briefly I must draw an annoy-
ing but necessary comparison.
While Woodstock lacked the pre-
cision and orchestration of Lolla-
palooza, the communal sense of
artistic celebration were similar.
Lollapalooza was far more pro-
gressive minded, more focused,
intense, and mature than the great
love-inon the field. Perhaps thatis

Closer to Live

Widepread Panic is about, but the
song’s funky groove, which high-
lights a horns section, gives the
listener a well-deserved break from
those long and at times tedious
chordal jams.

As far as the album’s musi-
cianship is concerned, David
Schools earns the MVP. With the
help of drummer Todd Nance, he
dominates the band’s sound. John
Bell’s voice leaves much to be
desired, and, as hard as I try, I find
nothing good to say about the lead
work of guitarist Michael Houser
(whatever happencd to those cool
little melodies we heard on Space
Wranglek?). Also, Panic would
be smart t keep keyboards in their
performing line-up because they
do contribute greatly in breaking

up the guitar muddle of Houser
and Bell. Finally, the bongos and
congas sound fruity in the context
of most of Panic’s songs. Give
Domingo the axe.

All in all, Widespread’s new
album, if anything, is certainly a
more accurate portrayal of their
live sound. In that aspect, the
album shows a good deal of devel-
opment from Space Wrangler.
Thisalbum, however, will notraise
the band beyond local fame. Wide-
spread Panic demonstrates the
band’s strength in cohesiveness,
but also its lack of musicianship.
Occasional listeners will miss those
old bee-bop ditties. Veteran Wide-
spread fans, however, will enjoy
72 minutes of well-engincered
Panic sound.
