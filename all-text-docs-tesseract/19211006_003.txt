CHRISTIAN

ACTIVITIES

SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND BIBLE
CLASSES KEEP UP GOOD WORK

The attendance in the six Sunday
Schools showed a great increase over
last Sunday. As Sunday was Rally Day
the attendance at Shearer reached 105,
more than three times their attendance
a week ago. The Christian Endeavor
has a live society there and much inter-
est is shown. The attendance at Cald-
well dropped, owing to the preaching
services held in Huntersville. Despite
the lack of attendance from Huntersville
the people were eager in attendance and’

‘zealous in their study.

MINISTERIAL BAND PLANS
FOR FULL PARTICIPATION |

A very interesting meeting of the
Ministerial Band was held Sunday aft-
ernon in Shearer Hall. The Band was!
very fortunate in having as guests E, H.
Hamilton, of the class of ’17, and George
Bellingrath, of the class of ‘18.

Mr. Bellingrath delivered an interest-
ing talk on preparation for the ministry,
and Mr. Hamilton gave a very appro-|
prite short sermon taken from Hebrews,
chapters 9 and 10,

Plans were then discussed for holding
regular meetings every, Sunday after-
noon, The officers are working on a
plan by which each member will be,
able to take part in every meeting. Aft-
er a short business discussion the meet- |
ing was closed by a prayer by Mr. Ham-
alton.

VOLUNTEER BAND MEMBERS
HEAR TWO GRADUATES SPEAK |

The members of the Volunteer Band |
were glad to have with them on last |
Sunday morning two former members,
E H. Hamilton and George Bellingrath, |
better known as “‘Ham” and.“Bill.” As
“Ham” and “Bill” are both volunteers |
for the foreign field and will take up
that work as soon as they graduate from
Union Theological Seminary, they gave
the members of the Band many words |
of encouragement. “‘Ye are’ my wit-
nesses,” was the theme of the talks. Fel-
lows, if you are to be true and loyal wit-
nesses of Christ, you must be willing to
pour out your life blood as a sacrifice
for the millions who are spiritually |
starving.” To such words, filled with the
spirit of God, the members listened in-
tently. “Bill” explained that the great-
est opportunity that we would have as
witnesses for Christ is right here in col-
lege, thus pointing out very clearly our
duties, opportunities and privileges. Then
the great need of the world was shown,
and a mental picture given of the starv-
ing millions in-the Far East and in-all
the foreign fields, The talks were in-
teresting throughout and very inspiring
to every man. It was truly said by)
someone after the meeting, that “God)|
seemed to be there.”

AFFAIRS OF ANATOL MOVIE
ATTRACTION LAST SATURDAY

With the combination of a great pic-
ture, a new sereen, and a good operator,
“The Affairs of Anatol” Saturday night
was the hit of the season.

But how could a play help being good
when even the minor parts were taken
by stars like Monte Blue, Agnes Ayers,
and Bebe Daniels. Wallace Reid and
Gloria Swanson were the brightest, most

scintillating stars of this production, but’

Wanda Hawley and Theodore Roberts
were by no means far behind,

There was, of course, no main plot.
But the three tangles in which “Wally,”
Anatol, involved himself well
brought out. Things are kept lively all

as are

the time, for when Anatol does take the |

trouble to go home he has a wife to
remind him of past sins and present
wrong doing.

It hardly seemed necessary for Ana-|

tol to destroy so much furniture in the
first act, but it gave a splendid oppor-
tunity for seeing Wallace
tion. He
wrecking a room more thoroughly if he

Reid in ac-
could not have succeeded in

had been taking lessons with a moving,

company.

But the climax came with Bebe Dan-
“Satan Synne.” What she show-
ed Anatol of back-stage life convinced
him that the softer lights of home beat
the “Great White Way.”

The-play-ends—with-one-of “Wally'’s”
incomparable kisses; of course not ac-
complished all by himself.

The management deserves a vote of

iels as

‘thanks for procuring sych a high class

production after its release.
Many other excellent pictures will fol-

low throughout the season,

so. soon

there was ice cream, and cholocate, too,
