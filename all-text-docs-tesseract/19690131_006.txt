“In concrete and liberal

Tallman saw one major
disadvantage to a church.-re-
lated college. This disadvan.
tage “is related to the basic
problem the church is not
confronting -the church finds
itself lagging behind the times
and wonders if it has the de-
sire to move ahead.

“The fundamental dilemma
that the church is in the
midst of creates a problem
when the church has tr deal
with an educational institu-
tion whose lifeblood is the
study of man and his accom-
plishments. his present cir-

Fine Films

The early efforts of one of
the great experimenters in
film making wilt fill the
screen in Spencer Love Au-

8 p.m.

The film is ‘Blood of a

Poet." which was written.
directed and narrated by
Jean Cocteau. ft is the
fourth presentation of the Da-
vidson College Fine Film
Program.

Cocteau. a novelist, sculp-
tor, essayist and philosopher.
began making films in the
1930's. His best known films
are “Beauty and the Beast”
(1946) and. “Orpheus”
(1949).

of students.

The committee had consid-
ered the matter because of
the provision concerning
drugs as stated in the Code
of Responsibility.

The provision reads: ‘‘The
medically unsupervised use,
possession, or distribution
of potentially harmful drugs
such as hallucinogens. am-
phetamines, barbiturates and
opiates is illegal and sub-
ject to very harsh penalties.

“Further, the use, of many
of these drugs threatens the
physical and mental health
of the users, and the use by
one person may also threat-
en the welfare of others.
Therefore, the college will
not tolerate the medically
unsupervised usé, possession
or distribution of any of
these drugs."

we all must realize, for next
fall the lives of about 290
incoming freshmen will be af-
fected by what we do or do
not do now,"’ he said.

The Senate's recommenda-
tion would give freshmen
their own choice about par-
ticipation in basic ROTC after
a two-week trial period at
the start of the freshman
year.

Burney said the Senate
committee wahts the trustees

She Bauvidsonias

. ‘This Place Could Kill A Protestant’s Religion’

pointed out the “nebulous
value” to Davidson’s church
relationship. “It fosters the
illusion that this place is a
haven for future ministers.”

“When you go back to your
town, people think that this is
a Utopia—all the old buddies
do, anyway.

As disadvantages, Whit
field said that the methods of
electing trustees by presby
teries and the stipulations
placed on the selection of
the president of the college
and for faculty tenure were
limiting.

The Presbyterian ministers
elected to the Board of Tris-
tees by the presbyteries “‘as
a group have one viewpoint
on a lot of issues," Whit
field said.

Whitfield pointed out the
trustee bylaw that states that
the president of the college
must be a Presbyterian at the

time of his election by the
trustees. ‘“‘We were able to
get a good man (President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.) this
time.”’ but Whitfield said that
such a rule might limit the
selection in the future.

Whitfield also referred to
the bylaw which states that
all tenured professors must
be Christians. ‘‘That a profes-
sor has to believe in the Lord
God Almighty is kind of limit-
ing.’’ Whitfield said.

Whitfield added that many
students are agnostics when
they leave Davidson. ‘‘Per-
sonally. I don't think it's a
bad thing—it’s a more en-
lightened viewpoint.”

Cader Howard, a senior,
said that Davidson and _ its
church relationship were ‘‘all
a little hypocritical.”

In future years, “you know
you're going to participate
in a church.” but now “you'd

ched next week by the Honor
Court and. the library staff.

A list of the some 170
books missing from the li-
brary, as determined by last
September's inventory, a-
long with a cover letter
from Honor Court Chairman
Bill Williams, will be dis-
tributed in the dormitories
and to students living off
campus on Monday.

“The library has offered
to waive until Friday ...
the $1 fine due for each book
removed without charging
from the library,"’ Williams’
letter says.

“After that time, the mat-
ter will be turned over to the
the Investigating Commit-
tee, and situations involving
any of these books that are
found will be examined in
the context of the Honor
Code.’ ‘

Every year the library
faces the problem of missing
books, Dr. Chalmers G .Da
vidson, director, said, but
this year the problem has
been more acute because.
fewer books have been re-
turned.

The library staff estimates
that the missing books will
cost about $1.700 to replace.

“Obviously,"’ Williams’ let-
ter says, ‘if a book were re-
moved from the library, and
the borrower simply forgot
to check it out. this would
not constitute an -honor of.

like to believe and don’t —
you feel a little bit guilty.”

Howard said that he came
to Davidson because of his
own Presbyterian ties. He
said that he was very active
in his church during elemen-
tary and high school.

At Davidson, Howard said
that he was experiencing ‘‘a
period we all go through
when religion means very
little—it’s a crutch. and the
average student feels he does-
n't need a crutch."

Howard said he favored re-
quired Bible and religious
courses. “‘Christian culture
plays such a large role in
our society, and one should
be at least familiar with
Christianity’s precepts and
with church history.”

“Perhaps it would be better
to veer away from minutiae
in beginning Bible courses,"
he added, ‘and to encourage
students to take courses that

fense, so long as he intended
to bring the book back. If.
however, he took .the book in-
tending to keep it, then he
has violated the Honor
Code."’

Williams’ letter came after
consultations with the faculty
Library Committee and rep-
resentatives of the student
Senate and THE DAVIDSON
IAN.

LEWIS LAVINE
.. . WASP’s’ great for me’

offer a more contemporary
viewpoint.”’
George Cretekos, a senior

and a member of the Greek
Orthodox Church, said ‘my

religion has been so instilled

in me that I haven't really
been concerned with the
Presbyterian Church.”’

Citing a specific example.
Cretekos said he found it

“a little ironic’ that David- .

son holds classes on Good
Friday and that the college
and Protestant churches in
the town have so few services
during Holy Week.

Senior Lewis Lavine rep-
resents another minority
viewpoint. “I came from a
completely Jewish back-
ground—a half of my elemen-
tary school and about a third
of my high school were Jew-
ish.”

At Davidson, ‘‘my religion
became stronger because I
went through an_ identity
crisis," Lavine said.

Looking at Davidson from
a non-Christian viewpoint.
Lavine said, “This. place
could kill a Protestant’s re-
ligion. I've seen guys who
have been crushed.”’ when
they were confronted with
an. intellectualized approach
to the Bible, faith and re-
ligion. “They didn't want to
believe and they didn’t want
not to believe.*’

Noting the homogeneity
that Davidson's church re-
lationship seems to encour-
age, Lavine said, ‘‘Everybody
here is so straight—they‘re.
a bunch of WASP‘s, and
that’s great for me.

“Tt doesn't hurt me to see
a bunch of Southern Presby
terians—I've never seen them
before,’ Lavine said. “But
on the other hand, they should
see more Jews, Negroes and
Catholics.” :

becaiise rot enotigh students

had Tiled. : ss .

The convention is to: con-=
sider revisions in’ the SGA
constitution, which along
with revisions to be made in
the Code of Responsibility, ,
will rearrange the campus
judicial system and make
the Bill of Rights part of the
Code of Responsibility.

First meting of the con-
vention is set for Monday
night at 9:30 in the Green
Room of the Union. Meet-
ings are open.

Proposed revisions, which
have been mailed out to the
convention members, would
establish three basic courts:
an Honor Court, Regulations
Court and Court of Constitu-
tional Review. Over the
three courts would be a six-
member student - faculty
Court of Appeals.

Cases appealed from the
new Court of Appeals would
go to the trustees.

Present judicial structure
provides for a Regulations
Court and an Honor Court,
with a seven-member stu-
dent Court of Appeals over
them.

Over the student Court of
Appeals is the Faculty Ex.
ecutive Committee, from
which appeals would go to
the trustees.

This seven-member _ stu-
dent Court of Appeals would
become the new Court of

falo, Springfield songs.

“H we find a song we like,
we get together for a jam.
If it sounds different, it does-
n't matter.”’ Kentner said.
“We are not particularly in-
terested in the arrangement
of good stuff.”

The most obvious faults in
Natchez Trace's performance
are confined to electrical
problems which have sup.
posedly been corrected since
then. There was excessive
and unwanted feedback be-
tween songs. The lead sing-
er’s microphone was not at
a satisfactorally audible lev-
el.

Also, the strobe light sound-
ed like a rusted coffee grind-
er, and it was distracting
when turned on before the
music started.

The performance of Nat-
chez Trace on stage is not
very smooth or refined. When
the drummer was singing the
lead in “Act Naturally,”’ he
was completely obscured by
the three guitarists standing
in front of him. Also, entering
and leaving the stage was an
awkward ordeal.

“We're pretty rough right
now, but we've got what it
takes,’’ Kentner said. ‘In a
couple of years it could be a
good thing."
