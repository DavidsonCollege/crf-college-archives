Community Government Utilizes Input
From Students, Faculty, Administration

By RICH WILSON
Editor-in-Chief

(This is the last installment
of a four part series entitled
‘Campus Gevernance: Crisis of
Authority.”’)

Sa lal .t. tis ScrieS We Nave
d.seussed ‘he bes ory of aca:
seme Love cPamee. the 'veak-
nesscs .n Dav dson’s case and
tne case four increased siuder:
parnespaticn.

in tis fme, arucie of the
SCcTres We nope io outline an al-
temmative to #he presen. govern-
unce structure and une advania-
Bes of cnanging io a different
method of decision making.

At present one of Davidson’‘s
Liggest governance difficulties
is factionalism. This situation
is caused by a faculty consti-
tution which advocates faculty
rule over the institution and
which theoretically provides
littie in the way of meaningful
administrative or student in-
put. : wa

Bui in practice. however, the
administration. and student body
nave challenged faculty power
in many areas. Thus we have an
administration and student bo-
dy cn the offensive and a fac:
ulty on the defensive.

The adminis.ration is eating
away at faculty power, but the
faculty constitution cannot seem
t> effectively curb the process.

The result is a war between

-vns.ituenc.es with eacn fight-
ng for a greater role in decis-
ion mak.ng. which produces
.vcdonalism.

Many other colleges such as
Davidson have experienced a
similar smuat.on. But these col-
leges have changed their gover-
“anee Siructure to include all
membe.s of ‘he college com-
munity. while Davidson conun-
des in its futile effort of dis-
yoint rule.

lf factionalism is our biggest
problem, then we must find a
way to neutralize factionalism.
And the most logical way to
neutralize factionalism is to un-
ify factions. In short we need a
community government.

Ii Davidion is going to call:

.iself an academic community.
then it must indeed act like a
comfunity. that -is a group or
g.oups of persons living together
who have common interests and
concems.

Instead of reinforcing separa-
. us of power groups, we should
encsurage .the development of
a governance structure which
brings these groups together.
In community spirit all groups
prosper and each segment con-
tributes something unique and
significant.

In essence we need a sharing
of power by adminis:ration, fac-
ulty and students which will be-
nefit all parties.

A unicameral college assembly
is an adequate governing struc-
ture which would convene sev-
eral times during the year and
pass legislation dealing with gen-
eral academic policy.

During the intevals between
meetings of the College Assem.
bly committees embracing mem.
bers of all constitutiencies couicd
prepare legislation and perform
the necessary research.

Faculty representatives might
compose the majo-ity of the as-
sembly with s-udent and admin.
isiraiive represe-tatives a‘so
included. This would allow the
faculty predominant influence
in all legislation but would alsu
include significant studen: and
adm.-.istrative input.

In addi-ion to the College <As-
sembly. the faculty could still
meet as a body to handle pro
fes:ional affairs such as faculty
salaries. reappointments. pro-
motions, dismissals. nomina-
ticos or simply to debate issues
so that the faculty represen:a-
tives would have an idea of fac-
ulty feeling on the issues.

The student senate would also
meet to decide student matters
and debate the issues as well,
Each constitutiency would keep
its identity, yet they would work
together in hammering out col-
lege policy.

A college assembly also pro-

ernance and no doubt a com-

bs such a governatce svstem
which would encourage a badly

Ouch a 58:em would avoid de-

by concensus. If the adminis-
fa.cun sheuld happen to impin-.
se «11 the decision making pow-
€i8 of the assembly. appropriate
action could rectify the situation.
In other words each consti:ut-
lency could effectively check
the others. thus creating a gov-
erning balance.

Such a governance structure
would insure that all within the
college community are heard.
Communications would be im-
proved, understanding enhanced
and information shared.

Hopetully a College Assembly
would engender some amount of
trust among the assembly in an
atmosphere of reascn and order.

We must divest ourselves of
the old and static compartment-
