Benchwarmers: Memoirs of the second best

_ They go out to their playing
fields six days a week. They sweat
it out, and work hard. They are part
of a select group of students who
are recognized as varsity athletes.
They also sit the bench.

While some individuals on a
varsity team stand out as terrific
athletes and skilled players, the
few people who play little or none
during the games receive much
less recognition. Does this bother
the ones who ‘bench it?’ Parker
Reich, a varsity lacrosse player
responds,

“No, not really. I’m playing
lacrosse because it keeps me in
shape. I thought it would be fun.
Last year on J.V, I improved a lot.
I thought I’d continue to improve,
but it didn’t work out,” he laughs,
“T haven’t improved at all.”

Does he resent his coach for
his lack of playing time? Parker
looks surprised.

“Why the hell - oh sorry, why
should I play? If the game was tied
or anywhere near close and he [the
coach] told me to go in, I'd be like,
“What, are you kidding me?’ I'd
screw up, let my team down. I’m
not good enough.”

Does he wish he’d quit? “Well,
it gets hard sometimes. The fact
that I’ve been on campus four
weekends in a row bothers me a
little. But I have no bad feelings
about playing. What else would I
be doing? I'd get fat; I’d be bored.”

When asked if he sees himself
as a positive influence on his team,
Parker responds good naturedly,

“Yeah Ido. I really do. [’m
there every day, doing my best.

#9 finally got in after riding the bench for three years. Unfortunately he completely lost his mind

I’m a lot less serious than most of
the other guys. And that’s not just
sports, that’s everything. I care
about the game a lot, but I’m not
overly intense about it. I like la-
crosse, practice is where I get to
play.”

A girl’s varsity lacrosse player,
Ilona Petery, has. a different opin-
ion.

“T feel like as the six of us sit
there on the bench, the coaches
forget we’re there. They keep the
starters in for literally the whole
game and barely play. us. I think
it’s acomplete waste, because our
skills are not so inferior to their’s
that we couldn’t enjoy some play-
ing time. It’s a waste of time and
energy for us to practice all week
and not play in games. Especially
when the times we did go in the

a hs

team benefited in some way.
Whenever the benchers went in,
something good happened, there
were never any disasters. Its not
like anyone ever died. Come on,
whats a few points for the other
team here and there” Even so ,
Ilona wants to continue her la-
crosse career.

“T love the sport. I guess in all
varsity sports there are those who
start and those who don’t, because
not everyone has the same abili-
ties. It was an accomplishment to
make varsity because the team is
so good. Ourrecord was 15-0. But
the coaches should make it more of
an equal arrangement. I should

_ feel like a significant part of the

team, not just a substitute for some-
one with stronger skills that me.”

Tucker Braddock , a senior var-
sity baseball player, quit three
weeks into the season. ;

“T quit because I was the sev-

enth string pitcher. There are a lot
of other things I’d rather be doing
with my time, especially if I’m not
going to play at all.”

Does he miss it?

“Well. it’s nice to have my
weekends free, but I miss just hang-
ing out in the locker room, or get-
ting psyched for a game. I miss
being part of the family, because
that’s what it was like, a family.”

Bob Andrian, a well respected
faculty member, and coach of two
varsity sports, does not feel bad for
not playing all of the players
equally.

“No, I think I try to feel for
them. I empathize with them as
much as possible. I think if you’re
being unfair as a coach, and deny-
ing a guy even the opportunity,
then there will be some resent-
ment. It gets hard as a coach when
the players are close in ability,
when its’s hard to see who’s got
that edge. In a case where evety-
one is on the same level, then I

think everyone should be able to
play.”

Does he think that the ones who
don’t play develop negative atti-
tudes?

“No. I think the biggest prob-
lem is when he or she loses his or
her confidence, or thinks he’s lost
the coaches confidence. You have
to watch those people very care-
fully, because you don’t want them

_tolose enthusiasm. There are those

who feel as ifthey’re coming along
and have the ability, and might
have a resentment that they don’t
voice, but comes out on the field.
The important thing is letting the
ones on the bench know that they
are an integral part of the team.
The best way to have it is when the
starters let the other guys know
that they are important through
words of encouragement in prac-
tice or in games.”

Another varsity bench warmer
whenasked if frustrated responded,

“Sure it gets frustrating. I go
out there , work my butt off, and
see very little results. But we have
fun with it sometimes. We were
going to make shorts for the six of
us that said Girls Varsity Lacrosse
on the front and then in big block
letters on the butt: PLACE BENCH
HERE. We never got around to it
, though.”

Did she have any advice for
other struggling athletes contem-
plating on whether or not to con-
tinue a sport?

“Well, it depends on the per-
son, and their coach. If a coach
makes you feel invisible, and the
player is clearly having a horrible
time with the season, I’d say bag it.
But if the coach tries to be fair, lets
you know whatis going on, and the
bencher is happy with what he or
she can get, I’d say stick with itand
just try to have fun. Imean, it’s just
a sport, you know.”

Memo found: B.J. wants courts named for him

The memo was found in the
tree swing of Sig Ep. It reads: "I
though everyone would want the
courts named for me. The money
could still go forthe Reading Bud-
dies. I just want to make my mark
at Davidson. I dream about the
B.J. Rudell Basketball courts."
The memo was dated this year and
signed by Rudell, the senior sena-
tor who led the outdoor basketball
movement."

A.D. Terry Holland is just
glad to know who has been send-
ing him all of the letters and peti-
tions. "Now I know who's behind
all of this."

Ortega, the winner of the
drawing, says, "If he wanted it that
bad, he could have told me!"

Friends of B.J.'s say his modesty
stems from his political aspirations.

They are surprised he even wrote
the memo.

The F-14 will of course make

course Dave Harding takes it for
the weekend, because—as he
says—it is the ultimate babe mag-
