College And Church: ‘You'd.

Like To Believe And

By CHARLES McEWEN
Associate Editor
Last of Three Articles

“God is slick and shiny
from a distance, but when
you get up close, He isn't
there.”

That’s senior John War
ren’'s view, a view that is
symptomatic of the problem
some students face at Da
vidson College.

The college.- by requiring
that students take courses in
Bible and religion, forces
some students to intellectual-
ize their Sunday School faith
in God. And in this intellect
ualizing process. some stu-
dents lose their faith alto
gether.

Other students see at Da
vidson only a veneer of re
ligiosity, which they find de-
sirable. but not necessary.

Still others find that they
can affirm their commitment
to human and Christian val.

6 - Month Alumni
Fund Drive Set

Plans to raise $300,000 to
finance Davidson's educa-
tional program for the cur-
rent year by gifts from its
10.000 alumni were announc-
ed this week by President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

The “Living Endowment,”

paign will aim at reaching
its goal by June 30 of this
year, Spencer said.

Each class of alumni will

Mrs. Nicholls To Solicit
Dormitory Improvement

Mrs. Peter Nicholls. direc-
tor of student housing, said
last week that she will ask
for funds for dormitory im-
provements in her next bud-
get request.

Lounges are planned for
next year in dormitories
which do not have them, Mrs.
Nicholls said. Additional
plans call for carpeting in the
existing lounges of Richard-
son, Little and Belk dormi-
tories.

There will probably be

more such projects, but none
will be planned until after
the budget request is submitt-
ed sometime before Feb. 1.
Mrs. Nicholls said. A new
lounge will be built in Can-
non Dormitory, which has an
improvised one already, she
added.

Mrs. Nicholls said that stu-
dents “can count on some-
thing: being done about the
buildings’ because “the need
has been recognized” by the
administration.

Spencer said that the funds

said, are ‘expensive but

In essence, Davidson may
be a church school, but it is
not a religious school in any

sense. And although Davidson
is supported by the Presby-

of some trustees and the
president and for faculty ten

The Rev. Scott Woodman
see sees his job as college
chaplain as ‘a ministry of
presence. I am _ involved
where students are, and I am
interested in what students
are thinking and doing.”

Woodmansee said that he
found three maior advantages
to Davidson’s church rela
tionship. ‘It means that the
Christian faith will be a vi
able ovtion.

“T think it also means that
there is a great deal of con
cern about values. but this
might be the case in any
liberal arts college whether
it’s church-related or not.”’
Woodmansee said.

The Davidson-church rela.
tionship ‘‘also involves finan
cial support. of course."’ he
said.

Asked about the religious
life on campus, Woodmansee
said. ‘It is hard to sav any
one thing that characterizes
feelings about religion and
faith.”

The four vears a student
spends in college are ‘‘a time
of doubt and questioning. The
quest to know who we are
is often a religious quest.”
Woodmansee said.

“The college tries to vro-
vide influences.” he added.
“but it must free students to
hurt themselves.”

In another phase of his
job, Woodmansee also serves
as adviser to the YMCA.
which through its various
programs directly
some 200 students, according
to the adviser's estimate.

“The YMCA tries to pro-
vide programs that include
education, worship and ser-
vice,"’ Woodmansee said.

“Students are looking for
what's authentic’’ not neces-

sarily dogma and denomina-
tionalism. .As a non denomi-
national group, ‘‘the ‘Y’ is a
good outlet."

Senior Sam Tallman em-
phasized the advantages of
attending a private, but not
necessarily church - related
liberal arts college. Such a
school provides an ‘atmos
phere that is free from the
value of the masses.

“The major religious
groups preserve a freedom
of inquiry. The liberal arts,

Unlike the usual pathetic
turnout for opening night of

dents came to hear the coun
try-rock music of Natchez
Trace on Monday evening.

Natchez. Trace is a four -

group from Cleveland, Ohio.

They get their name from
the Natchez Trace, a pioneer
road between Natchez, Miss..
and Nashville, Tenn., which
was used in the early 19th
century.

Considering the fact that
the group has been together

and is a versatile guitarist.

Hearing
Monday

The fate of Mrs, Colleen
Norket’s application. for a
beer and wine permit will be
decided. Monday morning by
the state Board of Alcoholic
Control. Mrs. Norket said
this week:

Mrs, Norket. who is appeal
ing an earlier administrative
decision denying her the per-
mit, has the right to appear
before the board, but has in-
dicated she wil! not.
“Instead, her attorney, Mel-
ville Broughton, will present.
the case to the board jin Ral-
eigh.

However, Mrs. Norket said
an ABC official in Charlotte
had intimated that she will
receive the permit.

Mrs. Norket’s original ap-
plication was turned down
after Davidson Mayor F. L.
Jackson and the Davidson
Town Council opposed it.

However, she appealed the
decision. and was heard by
the ABC appeal board Jan.
9. The delay since then has
come because the full ABC
b meets only once a
month, and it must make the
final decision.

If Mrs. Norket receives the
permit, it will be the first
time beer has been legally
sold within the Town of Da-
vidson.

The college charter carri-
ed an anti-alcohol provision,
banning sales within five
miles, until several years
ago, when two students tried
to turn in Hattie's.
