has some valid reason for being

“but the committee questioned
whether living together is
essential to all of these
programs.”

In- another housing first,
present’ freshmen were
allowed to request blocks of
rooms in Belk Dorm. Seven
groups took advantage of the
program, and were assigned
adjoining rooms in the wings of
Belk.

These blocks were limited to
six rooms, or in other words, 12
students." explained Mrs.
Nicholls. Only one of the blocks
reached the limit of six rooms.
“If students in the blocks

decide they want to drop out,”
said Nicholls, “they are tree to
do so. I hope that having a
group of friends for neighbors
will make living in Belk at least
a little more pleasant.”

..Pharmacy Pricings Studied

the same color. like tor
tetracycline. all orange and
yellow.

“Some generic drugs are
made by reputable drug com-
panies. but they usually don't
have distinguishing marks on
them other than a numerical
code. The brand name drugs
are always stamped.” he said.

Some of the arguments
against the use of generic durgs
in place of brand name ones are
that the former are not made

with the same quality of
materials and that some
disreputable drug firms do

make them

This kind of argument
however is mostly held by older
doctors, while younger ones
don't think that these argu-
ments hold.

This type of feeling is also
held by pharmacists, according
to Lamas. “Every druggist I
talked to said that they wouldn't
give a generic drug to anvbody
in their family.”

Yet trom the study he did.
Lamas indicated that in 12 of
the pharmacies. the generic
drugs were manutactured by
reputable drug companies, and
in 14 out of the 15 pharmacies
the druggist did actually fill the
prescription generically

“Either the druggist is giving
out interior drugs. or he is lying
to you when he tells vou about
his objections to generic
drugs.” criticized Lamas.

He also mentioned another
money making scheme which
pharmacists use which costs
the general public in revenues.

The idea involves those
patients who need drugs and
are on a government medical
assistance program. such as
Medicare or Medicaid.

Each pharmacist has a form
for such cases with the patient's
name, the type of prescription.
and the number of pills given on
it. Under federal law. the phar-
macist is allowed to turn the
form in for reimbursement and
receive two dollars for each
prescription of a medical
assistance patient.

‘What the druggist will do for
example,” explained Lamas.
“is to tell a patient with a hun-
dred pill prescription that he
only has fifty pills at that time
and ask the patient to come back
for the other fifty the next day.
That way. he'll get a reim-
bursement tor two order forms
instead of one.”

In his report, Lamas states
four main things which he
thinks will help this situation for
the consumer and lessen the
power of the State Board of
Pharmacies. and thus _ in-

dependent drug stores and their

prices.

First. he advocates the
repeal of the ‘gross im-
morality’ clause to allow

pharmacists. particularly the
ones in the chain stores, to ad-
vertise their prices and allow
the consumer to selectively buy
his drugs.

Lamas would also like to see a
restructure of the State Board
of Pharmacy in order to keep
licensing practices fair.

The structure he thinks would
work best for the consumer
would be to have one phar-
macist representing the in-

dependent store. one tor the
chain store. one from a govern-
ment clinic drug store, and one
druggist each trom a hospital
and medical building drug
store. This. Lamas feels. would
serve all interests best.

Another change needed ac-
cording to Lamas is to keep in-
dependent drug interests out of
pharmacy colleges. Under the
present system these special in-
terest groups won't allow phar-
macy internships in chain drug
stores.

Medical colleges should teach
courses in pharmacology.
Lamas teels. since” most
physicians right) now are
unaware ot the various drugs’
eftects on their patients con-
sidering that the doctor
prescribes around 14 drugs for
each patient in an average
hospital stay.

The only contact with drugs
that doctors have are through

medical journals. and they only
advertise brand name drugs.

The last change. he feels.
should come through the con-
sumer increasing his
knowledge and awareness ol
drugs in his purchasing.

He feels that patients should
make their doctor write out a
prescription generically so as to
lower the purchasing price of
the drug.

When the consumer ts in the
drug store. Lamas recommends
that he first know what he
wants and needs. and have the
pharmacist give him what he
wants.

Another thing the consumer
can do is to ask the druggist the
expiration date on the par-
ticular drug and be sure it ts

good before he buys it.

Lamas teels that the ab-
normalities in the retail drug
picture persist because the
responsibilities of the under-
staffed Food and Drug = Ad-

ministration don't allow for the
tvpe of inspection necessary to
correct the deticiencies.

So tar, response to his 70 page
report has been very favorable
The Charlotte Observer has had
the report for a few weeks. and
says that it will make a good
series of expose articles for the
newspaper, but just when it will
be printed they haven't said.

Lamas feels that this may be
due to the loss of drug store ad-
vertising which might follow
from such an article.

...Leaders Discuss Policy

(Continued From Page 1)

Grant, one of three faculty
members present at Montreat,
also noted that no consensus of
Opinion is yet evident in the
faculty.

“It’s an exceedingly complex
problem,”’ he said. “We can't
measure all of the values in-
volved. There were several
requests for more information
at the meeting.

Lack of sufficient information
kept Professor of Biology David
C. Grant. member of the
Faculty Athletic Committee,
from committing himself on the
subject of subsidized athletics

“Basically I think that de-
subsidized athletics would be a
good way to operate. but one
must take into account the
benefits to the college which a
higher level of ball might
provide. It might be very im-
portant, for example. to play
national basketball."’ Grant
Said.

On the other hand, Grant ob-
served, a school the size ot
Davidson should not feel that it
must keep up with everybody in
all things.

“At the present it appears
that those portions of the
athletic budget that affect the
most students, such as_ in-
tramurals, receive a dispropor-
tionate amount." he said.

“However, it is hard to weigh
the affect of the basketball and
football programs on_ the

student body.”
