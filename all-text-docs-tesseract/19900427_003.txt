overcrowded; military efforts will
also fail according toSchmoke. He
also advises doctors to use illegal
drugs on AIDs patients since this
“drug disease” is spreading rap-
idly.

Justifying his policy, Schmoke
said, “our drug laws are blatant
and inconsistent.” Themayorcited
the government's subsidization of
nicotine and. the »prohibition of
alcohol earlier this century as two
examples. During prohibition mil-
» lions of Americans were drinking,
government was corrupt, and
criminals were prosecuted repeat-

edly, a situation very similar with
today's drug problem.

The debate of decriminaliza-
tion of drugs has gone unabated
since it was first proposed in April
1988 and Schmoke doesn’t’ “want
tosee thedebateend.” “Thatwon’t
happen until the status-quo is
challenged at open market-places
of thinking like Davidson College,”
said the mayor.

Mayor Schmoke, who came to
officein 1987, has helda number of
political positions during his ca-
reer. In 1977 he was appointed by

‘President: Carter as-a’member of
i the White House démestic policy

staff. Healsoservedasanassistant

United States attorney in Baltimore
and later as state’s attorney for
Baltimore City, the chief prosecut-

' ing office of the city.

While running for mayor,
Schmoke said that he wanted Bal-
timore to become known as “The
City That Reads,” and since his
election he has overseen the pas-
sage of the largest increase ever in
the city’s education budget. 3

Schmoke received his Bache-
lor of Arts degree in history from
Yale University in 1971. He stud-
ied'as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford

» University in England,and in 1976
he'received his J.D: degree from :

Harvard University Law School.

Black
Fraternity
Meeting

predominantly black fraternities do
not exclude others on the basis of
race or other considerations, al-
though they are fraternities; there-
fore, they consist only of men.” He
also feels that blacks decision to
attend Davidson shows a commit-
ment tointegration, “because there
are not many of us hereand weare
forced to integrate ourselves into
most of the activities thatare going
on at Davidson.”

Some members of the KAP
chapter at UNCC attended the
forum, among them was a white
member, Ron Stallings. When
asked if he had received any nega-
tive feedback from people outside
the fraternity, Stallings said he had
not. Conversely, most of the reac-
tions he had from both blacks and
whites were positive.

President Kuykendall also at-
tended the meeting and wasasked
about his views on KAP. Kuyken-
dall, however,-said that he was
waiting to receive the CCRL’s rec-
ommendation onKAP, and thathe
expects thatrecommendationinthe
“relatively near future.” ,

The recent report on the Qual-
ity of Student Life stated: “the task
force recommends that the college
support the efforts of students to
‘establish a traditionally Black fra-
ternity.”

will not be offered as a Davidson
major, students may study it as an
an academic “concentration” be-
ginning with the 1990-91 school
year. Tong said the program should
be attractive not only to students
whointend tostudy medicine. “The
fates may dictate thatany one of us
may have a child born in an ex-
tremely fragile situation, a parent
who has Alzheimer’s, or a bad
accident or a long-term disease.
It’s our responsibility to help stu-
dents appreciate the problems that
they and their fellow citizens will
face.”

Tong said next year’s medical
humanities concentration curricu-
lum will include a new course,
“Perspectives inMedicine,” which
will become the required prerequi-
site course. To earn the concentra-
tion, students will thenbe required
to take four courses from such
departmental offerings as “Genet-
ics, Society & Decsions;” “Sex Tech-
nology and Morality;” “American
Medical History;” “Medical Eth-
ics;” “Bioengineering & Health
Technologies;” “Economics of
Population;” “Death & Dying;” and
“Contemporary Moral Issues.”
One of those electives must con-
tain. an experiential component,
which might be conducted at the
Carolinas Medical Center.
