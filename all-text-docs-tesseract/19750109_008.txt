California ’75 or how I learned
to love Coors..:

Two all beef patties, special
sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles,

Got it.

And for those of you who think
this place is bad visit Provo,
Utah. People get arrested for
driving under the influence of
Coca-Cola.

Loose women kiss their
husbands on New Year’s Eve.
Nelson says Santa doesn’t have
any kids because he comes only

once a year.

Honestly Brigham Young
makes Davidson seem like ex-
citement plus. BYU is even
more intolerant than Davidson.
Rumor has it that they won’t
even let blacks be janitors. Do it
Mormons. Turkeys come in all
sizes and shapes.

So much for Provo, its a sick

place. We move on to the home
of the Wandering Jew, L.A. city
of the stars, don’t you wish that
you could be there, too? One if

Rifle Team Takes Sixth Place
In Seven-Way Tournament

By GLENN BALLARD
Asst. Managing Editor

The Davidson College Rifle *
Team shot off to a slow start
this season, loosing two of
their first three matches in ad-
dition to a disappointing sixth
place tournament showing.

In the first match of the
season which began in early
December, Davidson par-
ticipated in a tri-meet with
teams from the University of
Richmond and William and
Mary.

The shooting of the five man
Davidson team ‘‘shocked and
disappointed’’ Coach Abel
White of the ROTC Depart-
ment when they hit only a total
of.1180 target points out of a
possible 1500. This resulted in
a loss to both Richmond and
William and Mary by the point |
spread of 46 and 88 respec-
tively.

Nevertheless, White com-
mented confidentially that
“the team should be shooting |
in the 1260’s. They know their "
potential but they’re just not ,
shooting it; but I’m sure we'll
come up soon.”’

After dropping the season
opener to Furman before a
home crowd Dec. 6, the Wild-
cattes have posted two con-
secutive road victories. A Dec.
11 win over Wingate preceeded
a close victory over Catawba,
Dec: 17.

Donna Sherrill and Beth Tan-
ner have shouldered Davidson’s
offensive responsibilities, as
both have shot well over 50 per-
cent from the floor in the first
three contests. Tanner is a con-
sistent outside threat while
Sherrill has proved effective at
varied ranges.

As a team, Davidson has con-
nected on 40 percent of their
field goal attempts and 46 per-
cent of their free throw shots.

Sophoriore Katherine Mor-
ton, despite being the shortest |
starter on Davidson’s front line,
has. proved to be the team’s
premier rebounder, pulling
down just under 10 every game.

Davidson will attempt to ex-
tend their winning streak to
three Friday in Johnston Gym-
nasium against the women of

Indeed, the team did come
up twenty points to an even
i200 score on trouncing North
Carolina A and T who was only
able to pull 1108 target points
in their dual match in Decem-
ber 14.

Several individual members
of the Rifle Team have been
plagued by injuries this year.
White feels that may have
been a serious factor in the
early season competition.

One experienced
marksman, Craig Crosswhite,
tore some ligaments in his leg
which will put him out for
some time. Another member
of the team, Clark . Mc-
Chesney, came down with a
lingering virus which — wil
keep him out of action until af-
ter Christmas.Two members
of the team were put out by
that common ailment, chronic
cases of bad grades

Despite the many injuries,
the team has been able to ad-
just adequately, and it is well
balanced with solid efforts
from every member of the
group of top shooters.

The top five shooters include

senior Bob Anders with a 250
point average out of a possible
300 along with a junior Pete
Goodman. who has_ been
shooting in the same 250 point
range, followed by junior
Dallas Kirkendall at 245 and
TomMiller at 243.

Sophomore Curt Goho is a
regular, and he rounds out the
current five man team. Tom
Miller is a strong new addition
to the team according to
White, ‘‘he is improving at a
rapid rate and should be one of
the best Marksmen on the
team by the end of the year.”’

‘The tournament was a large
affair with seven teams com-
peting for the championship
which was won by Ap-
palachian State, one of the top
rifle teams in the country. The
Davidson team shot a com-
bined score of 1208 which is
their best effort of the year,
but they still only managed to
place sixth in overall scoring.

In the early two way_meet
with Furmé.:, Javidson shot a
satisfying 1206, just two points
behind their seasonal high, in
taking an easy win.
