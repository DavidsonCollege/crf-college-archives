Men’s Basketball Team Provides Area Senior
Citizens with First Hope Since New Deal

For the first time since Franklin
Roosevelt’s New Deal rejuvenated
the economy, local senior citizens
have something besides Golden
Girls to get them through the day.

Bert and Boswo h didn’t have
faith in anything until the Men’s
Basketball team’s success allowed

| him to pass his kidney stone.

“This basketball team is the best
thing that’s happened to me since
social security,” said local old-
timer Bertrand Bosworth.

“When Stephen Curry hit that
step-back three to put us up five
against Georgetown, I was able to
piss pain-free for the first time in

nine years.”

Bosworth said that if a human
being can ‘hustle as much on
defense as Max Paulhus Gosselin,
then the cure for cancer has to be
out there.

“I don’t believe my grandkids
really love me,” said Mooresville
octogenerain Betsy Woolford. “But
I believe in that Thomas Sander.
Handsome, too.”

Senior citizens flocked by ‘the
thousands to Belk Arena Tuesday
night to commemorate the success
of the men’s basketball team. Most
attendees cited the defunct ABA’s
Kentucky Colonels as their favorite
franchise and were shocked to
learn that a shot clock had been
instituted in 1954.

They were, however, very tuned-
in to Davidson’s run to the Elite
Eight. “I hate Jayhawks more than
I hate Krauts,” said Bosworth. “I
hadn’t cried since the 30s, but I
sobbed like a baby that night.”

Disney Releases New Features

‘Fox and the Hound 2: Fox vs.
Hound.” In a dystopian future in
which Alien, Predator and the
Terminator have killed each other,
there exist only two dominant
forces: the cunning, malevolent fox
(voice of Samuel L. Jackson) and
the relentless hound (Christian
Bale), who will stop at nothing to
avenge the playful scratch inflected
on him by Fox in the 1987 Disney
original.

“The Jungle (Book): Streets of
Chicago.” Based on Upton
Sinclair’s revolting exposition of
the meat packing industry, this
sequel to the 1978 Kipling adapta-
tion was slated to be the first-
known animated musical about
sausage production. Mowgli, hav-
ing recently immigrated to the
US., is reunited with Bagheera and
Baloo when he finds his friends’
entrails and incisors in a bin of
sausage. Not for the squeamish.

“Aladdin and Monkey Go to
White Castle.” Constantly blazed
off hashish on the palace balcony,
Aladdin and his monkey embark
on an epic carpet ride to Istanbul in
search of Doner Kebabs and a new
lease on life.

‘Sleeping with Beauty.” Soft-
core remake of the 1959 original.
Princess Aurora (voice of Jenna
Jamieson) receives a very different
prick than the one a spinning wheel
gave her animated predecessor.

‘Robin’s Hood.” On the streets
of Compton, Robin and his Merry
Men steal from other destitute
gangs and keep it for themselves.
Features the voices of Eminem as
Robin, Ice Cube as Friar Tuck, and
DMX as The Sherriff of
Nottingham. Coolio steps in for
the guitar-plucking rooster. Snoop
Dogg stars as the evil prince regent
biding his time in Detroit.
Decidedly not for children.

Freshman guy tries longboard-
ing, fails, takes up smoking

Smoking is just as sweet as long-
boarding and has none of the
short-term dangers.

Having never fully grasped the
slalom sidewalk surf, freshman
loser Mike Crandle traded in his

carbon fiber longboard for a carton.

of Camel Lights. “Smoking has all
the cache of longboarding and
none of the safety risks,” Crandle
said, taking a long drag.

During his year-long boarding
phase, Mike struggled to carve,
pump and slide brake, often only
thinking about the relaxing puffs
that awaited him at the bottom of
the hill.

“Quitting long-boarding wasn’t
easy, and I definitely couldn’t do it
cold turkey,” Schmidt said.

“But at least I now have a hobby
that won’t rack up a costly medical
bill”.

Battle for imaginary critter supremacy

Sonic the Hedgehog recently
edged Mozilla’s Firefox as the
fastest imaginary midsized burrow-
ing mammal at the Imaginary
Midsized Burrowing Mammal
Awards held right off the Royal

Raceway at Peach’s Castle. “I have
to thank the creators of Sonic 2.
Had I not been able to curl up into
a ball and charge up my spins I
never would have been able to
achieve the speeds necessary to
come home with this award,”
Sonic said Tuesday after accepting
the prestigious award. Among
those in Sonic’s entourage at the
ceremony: lifetime sidekick, Miles
“Tails” Prower. “It’s not a surprise
to me at all that Sonic walked away
with this one. Whenever he
throws on those red racing shoes he

simply is unstoppable. Had they
not allowed me to come back to
life after trailing off screen I never
would have been able to keep up
with Sonic and help him defeat
Doctor Robotnik.” The judges said
that their hung decision was
swayed by Sonic’s never-ending
hunger for rings and chaos crystals,
while Mozilla’s speed is weakened
by shitty internet connections and
splotchy wireless blankets. “I hate
to be a sore loser, but I can’t help
feeling 1 was robbed here at
Peach’s Castle. If I didn’t have a
‘very low’ speed rating on
Davidson’s wireless blanket, that
trophy would be on its way to my
mantelpiece.” Another factor the
judge's considered was Sonic’s
ability to break into boxes and put
on an impermeable shield, whereas
Firefox can be invaded and slowed
down by worms or Trojan horses.
Other notable attendees at the
Imaginary Midsized Burrowing
Mammal awards were Diddy
Kong, Papa Beaver, and the Lorax.

Archivist Appreciates the
Simple Things in Life

Maybe you’ve seen me around.
Probably not. I understand. I
mean, I do spend most of every day
secluded in the deepest, darkest
corner of the library. I am the

archivist, and that means nothing
to you now, reader, because the
effects of my daily clerical work
will not be appreciated or even
noticed for several years.

Of course,
access the minutes from a 1974

if you wanted to

meeting of the Davidson
Equestrian Club, I’m your girl.
How about the by-laws for the
short-lived Davidsonians for a
Warmer Globe? I’m the one to
ask.
Don’t believe me? Look it up.

Ha! You have to go through me to

do that! You see, archivists have a
sense of humor, too.

Lest you think I spend every day
staring at the poster of a beach

scene I tacked to the wall of my
windowless office 11 years ago, let
me explain that we few, proud
members of the worldwide
archivist’s fraternity are physically
capable of cracking jokes and
smiles from time to time.

For me in particular, it’s all about
the little things in life. Yesterday,
for instance, I placed my cell phone
on my lap after getting off the
phone with my mother.

Several hours passed without my
moving from my chair, so let me
tell you what kind of a shock I got
when the phone started vibrating
between my legs! That was some
afternoon delight even the stingiest
bibliophile can enjoy.

So, now that you know I’m not
gathering cobwebs in the depths of
the library, let me get back to for-
warding this chain email to my
niece.
