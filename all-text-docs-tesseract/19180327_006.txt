DR. SHEARER ENJOYING
FINE HEALTH

As Vice-President vf College and Pro-
fessor of Senior Bible he serves His
Master.

‘The many friends of Dr. J. B. Shear-

_er will be glad to know that he has en-
joyed a fine year. His health has been
exceptionally good as compared with the
preceding years. He is now vice-presi-
dent of the college and is professor of
Senior Bible. His classroom is in his
home, facing Shearer Hall, which stands
as a monument to the memory of Mrs.
Shearer.

Dr. Shearer's position in the college
world is unique. Before his agitation
of the study of the Bible, courses in’ Bi-
ble were given in practically no colleges.
He introduced it at S. P. U. It was a
success. [ater he came to Davidson.
With his coming came the Bible courses
which are so profitable today, Other
colleges and universities became attached
to this idea and similar courses were in-
troduced. As Poe standardized the short

story, so did Dr, Shearer standardize and
popularize the study of Bible in the col-
lege curriculum. ‘Uhis great movement
is attributable to our venerable professor.

As a theologian he is recognized as a
safe and sane one. He has made a won-
derful contribution in his Scriptural in-
terpretation.

Not only has Davidson College profit-
ed by these contributions, but it is he who
laid the broad and liberal toundations ot
the policy of the college which were as-
sumed by President H. Louis Smith, His
work in this regard was broadening, the
college curriculum. All Dr. Smith had
to do was to advertise the college and
the student body was greatly increased in
numbers.

Davidson College and the college
world together with humanity has a
great servant in Dr. Shearer.

DAVIDSON RESIDENCE
DESTROYED BY FIRE

Great blazes! Holy smoke! Fire!
After many “wolf” alarms the fire really
came and found many complacently call-
ing “Vire,” a signal announcing the ap-
preach of lady visitors on the Hill, but
a single took in the direction of — the
Graded School dispelled. this idea and
caused a graver one. A short distance
below the school, the home of Mr. Har-
vey Gibson caught fire a few minutes
after 6 o’clock in the afernoon, from a
defective flue. So rapid was its progress
that scarcely anything was saved, in fact
nothing, except a few articles of furni-
ture. Friends kindly took care of the
family and are doing what they can to
make them comfortable.

The house was owned by Mr, J. Lee
Sloan, and it is understood that the loss
was covered by insurance. The only
thing that saved the neighboring houses
was the direction of the wind, and even
then the sparks, threatening the houses
across the street’ required the faithful ef-
forts of the efficient bucket brigade and
the Pyrene demonstrator, who happened
to be on the scene, to save them.

One of our contemporaries-—the Uni-
versity “l'ar-Heel—states that the Uni-
versity is considering the organization of
a Varsity Horseshoe Pitching “Feam.
‘They are thinking of challenging Da-
vidson, U. of Virginia, Princeton and
Yale. As in every other form of ath-
letics, Davidson can be counted on to
lead the way. Practice is pretty general
all over the campus. “The Chambers
Champions (South Wing) are ready to
challenge the Gallant Gallopers from
Georgia and the Winsome Winners
from Watts. The Rumple Roustabouts
have not entered the league as yet. For
a Varsity team we would pick the fol-
lowing men: Right front shoe, Ken-
nedy; left front shoe, 1. C. McAskill;
right rear shoe, H. W. Davenport ; left
rear shoe, Fawlkes; substitute, G. Me-
Donald, Carolina would find this team
hard to beat.

DAVIDSON DEBATERS

(Continued on page 6)
ment was able to cope with unfriendly
aliens, making: it unnecessary. to intern
four millions of them. He said that as
it was against international law to make
aliens work against their country it

productive labor and put them where
they could be of no service. ‘

After the rebuttal and before the de-
cision, Dr. Martin made a short talk.
explaining that while Davidson is the
Presbyterian college of this State, La-
Fayette is the same for Pennsylvania.
He wanted to adopt the policy of the
Dayidson debaters and “intern” — the
Pennsylvanians and keep them in the
South.

The decision of the judges was four
to tin favor of Davidson,

Another feature of the debate, about
which too inuch cannot be said, was the
splendid work of the Davidson Orches-
tra. The orchestra came in mighty handy
and prevented avhat might have been an
awkward delay because of the lateness
of the train on which the Lafayette
speakers came. During the intermission:
the audience was entertained by the or
chestra with patriotic music.

ANNUAL MATERIAL

(Continued from page \)
a poem on “Camouflage” (we just -had
to write it): a page showing a few of
the “college pleasures ;" a “Department
of Advice” to some of our students; a
poem on the “pleasures” of Chambers:
also one on the “pleasures” of drill. ete.

Maybe you think they don't know that
good joke on vou, but you are mistaken,
for it will be in the Calendar if it is not
in the reminder of the Annual. “This
year the man who has no “honorable
mention” should worry, because, verily,
he is left out in the cold. If you want
to see yourself like others see you, be sure
to get an Annual to have that opportu-
nity.

One fact that gratities the staff is the
large number of students contributing
drawings, literary material and photo-
graphs to the Annual, for besides show-
ing student interest in the book, it makes
it truly a book of the students themselves.

The Annual will probably be out by
the first of May, and then you will see
for yourself that what has been said is
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth.

Dr. W. J. Martin and Dr. C. M.
Richards attended Synod, in Greensboro.
on last Thursday and Friday. Dr.
Martin remained over to hear the de-
bate between Davidson and Lafayette
College. :
