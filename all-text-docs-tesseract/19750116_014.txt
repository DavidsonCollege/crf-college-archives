B League Enhances Spiritual Musing

By FRANK STIEFEL
Asst. Sports Editor

After two years of frustration
and severe bodily pain, I have
hung up my flashy satin shorts
and left the realm of A League
basketball for a no-cut, guaran-
teed play contract with a B
League team.

Pride did not hold up my
decision very long, but then it
rarely does. Somehow, I just
could not relate to some mon-
ster trying to tattoo Spalding on
my forehead.

In A League ball, you are
always meeting some deranged
pre-med who is going to shower
you with elbows or clean your
clock on a breakaway. It just is
not really much fun unless you
are willing to take the ‘Bo
Brickels Oath of Dedication.”
Alas, dedication was never

one of my stronger attributes.
Although I am still feeling my .

way around the league, I like’

what I see. Warm-up is like a
study in alternated states of
consciousness. Airballs ‘out-
number swishes.

And the outfits are a
challenge. Some of Groucho’s
best suits, not to mention Har-
po’s; Zeppo could never have
competed in this league.

When tap-off time arrives
with half the players already
having nicotine fits, it always
takes a couple of minutes of
argument to get everyone
headed in the right direction.

Inevitably, the player who

“ retrieves the ball still hesitates,
trying to decide if he has an
easy breakaway or if it is
somehow possible that

everyone else is heading the

swimming coach Pat Drake hopes will be perfected in the coming

season. s

I’m afraid that this week we
have to get back to facts after
last week’s stream of con-
sciousness splurge.

And despite Dr. Rogerson’s
inability to show a semblance of
taste by taking our coulmn for
what it’s supposed to be (what
is that anyways?) and
mistaking it for a grammatical
showpiece, we will continue to
keep on defying the laws of
English, much to Dr. A’s

right way. :

After about three minutes of
30 yard sprints, everybody
finally gets it together and
realizes how insane all this un-
necessary running is. So the
game evolves into a cherry-
picking contest, or for you less
learned, basket-hanging. |

The unfortunate athletic
disease known as hustle thwar-
ted this life-saving tactic in
A League play.

Most of their players were
warming up for the nightly
metal-throwing contest. A visit
to the weight room should be
required for graduation. It
really is impressive.

My last game proved just how
valuable basket-hanging can
be. Early in the first half, I suf-
fered a severe ankle sprain try-
ing to perform the difficult task
of turning around.

Here I was, a useless cripple
and as usual, we only had five
players. However, in B League,

you merely have to look at the .

opposition to realize how easily
this problem can be cir-
cumvented.

As it was, the closest any of
their players got to me was to
the shirtail of my X-large
Davidson jersey as I drove in

’ for twelve unmolested lay-ups.

What a rush.

I have not scored 26 points
since I played my nine-year old
neighbor one-on-one.

B League is the frustrated
jock’s paradise.

dismay.

You don’t see us telling Dr.
Rogerson how to teach Spanish
do you?

Anyway this is an IMAC
column, and despite the lack of
games due to the usual lack of
gym time Bowie Andrews
managed to get in a few biggies
since Christmas, if you can call
a B-league game a biggie.

But we don’t mess with B-
league anymore, so you B
players (we use the word
loosely), go complain to Wetzel
and the Beach.

In A league action, before
Christmas nothing happened as
many games got canceled
because of the annual pre-
Christmas bun break by a lot of
professors on their hapless
students. And to top it all off
there were only two, yes, two A
jeague games played after
Christmas.

IFT, undeteated after four
games, blew out the Ragmen 44-
43 behind Schmader’s 17 points
while Larry Hibon chipped in
with 18 points for the Ragmen.
Coach Kirk Combe criticized
the inept ‘‘let ’em play”
refereeing. Thank you Kirk.

Until we meet again remem-
ber the great wisdom of the
young B.T. If God had wanted
people to be library rats he
would have made the whole
world like D.C.

The only other contest’ saw
the young Possums hurt C+III
69-35 as Mike Peskosky popped

in 30 points to continue as one of
the loops leading scorers.

C—III really reeks but a guy
named Blinkhorn (no relation to
Eason) scored 20 points.

Well seeing how we have to
have this column in today, and
there were only two games of
intramural consequence played
this last week we ain’t got a
whole lot to write about. So we
ought to quit while the article is
short and bad instead of letting
it get long and bad, right?

Maybe yes maybe no.

Ah ha, more news: the IMAC
swim meet was held the other
night, and we don’t have any
results yet, but at least there
were no reports of some young
library rat drowning doing the
breast stroke.

There isn’t anything funny
ahout the swim meet so we’re
gonna hang it up now, possibly
our worst column and, without a
doubt our shortest.

Boy are we lucky God ain’t
stupid, eh?
