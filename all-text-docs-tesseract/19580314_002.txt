Elimination Of Honorary Jobs
Will Bring Simplified Government

For years there have been voices
crying out at election time about the
faults of the voting system. The most
common complaint. and probably the
most justified, has been that the sys-
tem takes too much time. Interest
lessens in individual elections as they
extend week after week, and the vot-
ing percentages fall disgracefully low.

The elections board is speeding the
process by keeping the polls open five
days a week instead of on just the
three chapel days. The student body
itself, however, has the best chance
of making the process more rapid
simply by passing the two proposed
amendments to the constitution.

It seems natural to resist change.
particularly when it might be difficult:
to discover the meaning behind stilted.
legal terms We feel, though, . that
both of the proposed changes are bene-
ficial and deserve. to be passed.

One amendment would change the
election procedure for the editorship
of the three publications: instead of
running them one after another, they
would be runoff simultaneously. The
change is simple and quite logical
since a candidate for any one of the
offices does not run for the other two.
By the time a student becomes a
senior he has little trouble in deciding
which of the three races he wants to
enter.

The other amendment would do
away with four of the non-functional

jobs of the student body. It is a known
fact that the vice president and the
secretary-treasurer of both the sopho-
more and junior classes are merely
honorary positions requiring no work
and performing no duties. They carry
no vote and have no responsibility;
ihey serve merely as a subject for
photographs in the annual. All legal
authority is vested in the class presi-
dents and student council representa-
tives, positions which will not be af-
fected. The proposed amendment
would cut awav this dead wood which
we have inherited through tradition,
without changing any administrative
details.

The.same amendment would elimi-
nate a separate ballot for vice presi-
dent and secretary-treasurer of the
senior class by giving these jobs to
two senior councilmen. Again there
would be no change in class represen-
tation in any capacity nor would it
affect the voting power on the council.

The only possible arguments for
retaining the present system would
be “for the sake of tradition” or to
provide the extra honors. Neither of
these two seem to be valid reasons for
preventing a streamlining of our stu-
dent government.

Passing the proposed amendments
will mean both a speeded election sys-
tem and a simplified government, and
these benefits can be had with no
sacrifice. —J.R.J.

Another Hurdle

The curriculum committee has
jumped another hurdle in its drive to
revise the courses of study.

Its approval to liven up the Bible
curriculum as requested by the Bible
Department shows a willingness on
the part of the committee to permit
progressive changes. In recent years.
the Math Department, lately the Lan-
guage Department, and now the Bible
Department have shown the way to a
revised and revitalized curriculum.

Professor Schenck as chairman and
the other members of the Bible De-
partment have taken a popular and
much needed step in their course re-
visions. We support their new action
and congratulate them on this healthy
move. Other departments should join
with Math, Language, and Bible in the
move toward a better and more sig-
nificant curriculum.

Seeking Office

Often times in the midst of elec-
tion campaign fever, we tend to over-
look the real meaning of being elected
to office, particularly to the student
council.

From past cases, we know that a
student is sometimes more interested
in winning the election than he is in
offering his services, talents, and time
to the job to which he is elected.

With reference to student council
offices, let us urge students not to
run for the positions unless they fully
realize beforehand what responsibili-
ties the job carries. Election to the
student council means that the student
is willing to live the role of leader of
student affairs and not just a follower.

It means that he will not go out
of his way to miss seeing violations of
student body regulations and of the
Honor System. It also means that he
has the time, the interest, and the

ability to exercise a position of leader-
ship on the campus.

Before any ambitious student
signs up to run for office, it would
be a good idea for him to read over
the student body constitution and the
student body regulations.

Skit Night

The DAVIDSONIAN does not con-
done gross violations of normal stan-

dards of decency. Nevertheless, we
do feel that perhaps too much is be-

ing made over the tone of Wednes-
day's Skit Night.

It is so easy to let our sense of |

righteousness. muddle our thinking.
Perhaps the thing to remember is
that the entire program was con-
ceived in good faith, that no offense
was meant to anyone, and that its
original purpose was to bring the en-
tire group of fraternities together in
a common activity.

No doubt many professors who
seem so upset would give the fraterni-
ties a big “F” on failing to acheive
their purpose during Skit Night.

It is most unfortunate, however,
that some professors have taken it
upon themselves to make so much
over the incident. The expressed de-
sire to “punish” the fraternities and
“to put out the flames” of student
energies serves no good cause and on-
ly acts to tear down much good will
that exists between the students and
the faculty.

We cannot help but feel that Da-

vidson's 850 students are more than -

just little boys. From what we gather,
the Davidson student today is not
nearly so bad as his predecessors of
a generation ago. Indeed, those little
boys used to hiss and boo faculty
members off the stage!

All of this causes us to wonder just
what will happen to the Davidson stu-
dent. Will he ever amount to any-
thing? Will he turn out okay?

Yep, we kinda feel that he will.
And who knows, he might even grow
up to be a Trustee.

LETTER TO EDITOR

Protest Vesper Uproars, Carving In Church

Indignation”

Dear Editor:

I write this letter, not as a
Christian. but as one who lacks
the courage to live up to Chris-
tian standards in this secular
atmosphere. Each of us. in the
face of trial, ‘has experienced
the compromise of moral ideals,
an experience, which, painful at
first, soon becomes a virtue we
label realism. For moral ootiga-
tion we substitute an ethic of
wants and desires.

SKY GOD

Never stopping to view the
consequences, we. conveniently
adopt a middle of the road Re-
lativism and compartmentalize
our religion until it becomes a
meaningless ornament to be
dusted off in times of need. Our
spiritual complacency breeds
mediocrity and we find our-
selves no more than pagans wor-
shipping a Sky God in times of
drought.

Even when we declare our su-
pertiority over the outside world
naively involve ourselves in pet-
ty jockeying for positions of

worth and childish ego-assert-
ions. Thoso who have the eyes
to see what most are too blind
to notice: too often fall into
cheap scolding.
PEDAGOGY

At times, however, their peda-
gogy is better than the sloppy
sentimentalities of people too
ignorant and selfish to bear the
burdens of their own hypocrisy.
While we must realize that we

‘ourselves are guilty of many of

the faults we criticize, there are
times, if we are to maintain any
integrity, that we can't compro-
mise any longer, but must speak
out in righteous indignation.

The “Big” man who took it
upon himself to carve up the
House of God has brought un-
precedented disgrace to this stu-
dent body. Compulsory Vespers
or not, that Church was built
to serve this community to His
Glory, not as the object of brutal
impulses and thwarted humor.
No doubt mental poverty pre-
vents our “Big man's” realiza-
tion of what those initials mean
to Western civilization.

Many of us are too callous to

appreciate the tragic aspect in
Christianity, but the story of
His Life indicates to me that
Christianity is not another form
of tranquillizers or thrill pills,
and that Jesus Christ is not
synonymous with Kilroy.

No doubt our young artist
thinks himself quite clever. We
see his handy work frequently
on rest room walls and side-
walks. As a social parasite he
may have his fun at the expense
of others, but when he takes
‘our God and His Church to be
his province, we cannot be re-
strained by the futility of speak-
ing against such banefulness.

Allen Fry

No Reverence

Dear Editor:

Why is there a Vesper Service
held on Sunday night if all that
it leads to is the desecration of
the House of God? What are
the purposes of compulsory ves-
pers? If it is to instill in the
student a religious train of
thought, then it has failed

On Feedom, New Heritage

Men or Boys?

Dear Editor:

For the first time in my col-
lege career I know why I have
disliked Davidson College. I
have always resented her ma-
ternal attitude. However, I have
suffered in silence, hoping that
the powers that be, in their in-
finite wisdom, had the best in-
terest of the student. at heart.

Today, March 10, 1958, gany
semblance of faith in the execu-
tive committee’s judgement that
I might have had was shattered.
The benevolent fathers became
nothing more than bullies, poor
sports, bent on destroying the
student’s one mild form of pro-
test. I do not refer to the ban
on snowballing, but to the sly
manifesto issued in subtle warn-
ing to all who would hide their
faces.

TRADITION OF PROTEST

This school. so hell bent on
her tradition, her Woodrow Wil-
son Memorial Trees and her ‘re-
ligious"” services, now refuses
the student body her unique tra-
dition—not just the tradition
of the “Peon’s Army” but her
tradition of protest, the one
tradition that has allowed the
student to express his individ-
uality. Granted that many of
our actions have been childish.
but what more can be expected
when men are forced to assume
the status of boys in a “safe

place to send your boy?”

This may come as a shock
to many, but Davidson no long-
er holds the place of reverence
that she did when I was forced
to enter. The so-called David-
son Gentleman has passed from
the scene, and in his place cow-
ers a glorified version of “Peter
Prep-school.”

And I must assert that the
responsibility for this change
lies with the administration.
The student has no responsibili-
ty. He has no responsibility of
any kind. He is told where to
eat, and when to have his fra-
ternity functions, and how to
conduct himself while doing so.
Even the student council, our
one chance for fair representa-
tion, is told when they are right
and when they are wrong.

INSTITUTIONAL PRIDE

If we are to assume the re-
sponsible positions traditionally
held by Davidson men after they
leave these hallowed hall, we
must have practice. I will al-
ways contend that there are
enough intelligent men; who, if
given the opportunity, could
guide the actions of the stu-
dent body in such manner as
to keep well within the bounds
set by our trustees, and in do-
ing so, could generate some of
the institutional pride we most
certainly lack.

If we act like children, it is
because it is our only recourse.
If we are allowed to stand on

our feet as men, we can com-
mit ourselves as men. In free-
dom we can .and will find re-
sponsibility.

Unique Rite

Dear Editor:

Only recently have I become
acutely aware of another appar-
ent heritage of Davidson. This
obscure custom is so uniquely
and infamously ours that we

have jealously restricted its ex- .

pression ...

Carefully reserved for select-
ed occasions, this rite is now
presented only before campus
guests. Performances are given
just Tuesday; Thursday, and Fri-
day mornings; but for the last
two Sundays additional evening
presentations have been offered
for the real connoisseur .

QUAINT CUSTOM

Our quaint custom has finally
advanced from the stage to the
sanctuary, without suffering any
appreciable loss of effect. From
there it passes into posterity
. .. But our new heritage re-
mains for the present a proud
demagogue to teach the inno-
cent—that I too may parrot it
in worshiping at the shrine and
consecrate there my small token
to the altar of tradition.

miserably.

The comparison of the Morn-
ing and Evening hours of wor-
ship is like comparing night and
day. Vespers is no longer an
hour of worship and prayer but
has become, more or less, an im-
position rather than a privilege.

COMPULSION
Those who attend with the de-
sire to worship God with all
reverence due to Him are hin-
dered by the lack of reverence

and participation that goes on in
the service. Better not to have
it. than to give impetus to at-
titudes like these. Complusion
does not induce religion, by a
long shot.

Do we go to Vespers be-
cause we want to worship God
in His house, or do we go just
because the college requires it?

Sincerely,

A NEW ROAD TO HELL

By CHARLES HELMS

“It doesn’t matter whether you order a coke, a lime-
ade, ur a heep-beep at the Stud it’s still going to come out
99 and 44-100 per cent pure ice.”—E&d Lupberger.

Many of the college's Bible professors are recommend-
ing very highly the latest Biblical movie, “And God Made

Woman.”

Perhaps this could be brought to the Union

and the Billy Graham movie reshown with it.

M. A. (QUEENS)
Dr. E. Walker, president of Queens, states that one
of the main aims of their fund raising drive is to obtain a
library of 100,000 volumes. The day that this happens will
be the humiliating day that we will have to quit turning
up our collective nose at the sister school, inasmuch as
they will have 30,000 volumes more than our own library.

ROAD TO HELL
Hell Week seems to be a peculiar institution for a
church school which is supposed to be turning people in
the other direction. But as the fraternities are declaring
to their pledges: the road to Hell Week is paved with good

intentions.

Saddest story of the week: one senior, not too success-
ful during interviews says that his grades are so bad that
he can’t even get a job with the Army.

SNYGG
Famous last words: “Aw, we might have one question

on Snygg and Combs.”

In regard to certain mimeographed sheets in the

dorms: it would. seem that what we need here is the abili-
ty to distinguish between disciplinary problems and legiti-

mate satire.

COFFEE BREAK

Col. Ivanovitch
At Davidson

By JOHN BERNHARDT

Last week we had a strange
visitor on campus. Colonel Ivan
Ivanovitch, head of the Russian
Intelligence Service in the West.
secretly inspected the college to
give Moscow information on
American education and pre-
paredness. In his disguises, no
one suspected his real identity.
We have here a summary of
his report.

Sunday afternoon, when he ar-
rived, there was no one on cam-
pus. Assuming there was a big
rally, he ‘searched for the
crowds, but only found small
groups meeting in the darkness
of the fraternity houses. “These
must be capitalist cell meet-
ings,” his report states, “serious-
ly planning the overthrow of the
Communist regime.” The wo-
man on the television screen
seemed to be proclaiming the
new policy in a sing-song chant,
but he could not understand.

Finally, that night he found
all the students going to church.
Apparently all the students
were there, and the Colonel was
afraid this indicated that these
typical American students were
united behind their church in
opposing Communism. It was
with great relief that he saw
they took the whole thing as a
farce. “They are not much dif-
ferent from us after all, on
Christianity; but they lack any
one belief that might hold them
together. like our Communism,
and so they will have no chance
against our determination.”

As he sew the students crowd.
ing the Union, he was amazed at
the way the money was spent.
“America is surely the land of
wealth we have heard it was.”
However, the next day, in his
disguise of yard man, he was
amazed as well at the poverty
and humbleness he had to pre-

By Schulz

tend to. “I was expected to re-
frain from using the Union,
both because I had too little
money and because it. belonged
to the higher-caste college per-
sonnel.”

The _ students apparently
looked through him as they
passed as if he were not there,
and he learned that no student .
ever went to the town across
the tracks except occasionally
driving through. “Apparently
all advantages and benefits,
withheld from the people, are
reserved for the future military
and scientific leaders.”

The next afternoon ‘the
Colonel watched the local of-
ficer-candidates drill. His deep-
est impression was of the mock
army which also formed, and of
the reception it had. “They
showed that they have freedom
of action, and that they have
the full zest for life which is
necessary for a nation’s youth.
But there was also a feeling that
the army was only a farce to
be laughed at; it seemed to be
an unfortunate necessity to
them, with no real value or pur-
pose. If they continue this at-
titude, they will have no
genuine army to oppose us when
war comes.”

Wednesday there was a speech
on Russian education. Sitting in
the balcony, he concluded the
students must be well informed
on the subject, for most did not
listen, and only six came by
afterwards with questions. Talk
with others, however, surprised
him as to their lack of informa-
tion and concern. No one knew
any details on summit confer-
ence proposals or the Tunisian
crisis. .

“They ere worried onty about
their petty personal affairs.
Their government is left to run
itself, and will be without sup-
port or organization when we
¢lash. We need only remove the
few government leaders, and
the masses will fall completely.”

He concluded his report on
typical American youth leaders
with the following statement:
“They are filled with the fever
of spring at present, and enjoy
causing trouble as young people
should do; however, underneath
there is no solid foundation, for
they are unabashedly compla-
cent. They will make easy prey.”
