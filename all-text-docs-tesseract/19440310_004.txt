activity.

The speaker explained that artifi-
cial discovered
by Henri Buquetrel, and that since
more than 33. radioactive

atoms and isotopes have been dis-

Wiig continued, by shooting at

Sun’s Energy
The study -of- -radivaetivity has

operations of chemical changes, Dr.

Wiig indicated. “He also presented
the theory that the energy of the
sun might be the result of the ra-
diocative conversion of hydrogen to
helium with carbon as a annie
agent.
