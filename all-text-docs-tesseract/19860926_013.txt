ground game, giving up scores on
the Buccanneers first two posses-

-sions to fall béhind 14-0. Jacobs.

scored both toughdowns.

The Cats got on the board
early in the second quarter. ETSU
had the ball on their own 21 yard
line when junior linebacker How-
ard Humphries burst through the
line to sack the quarterback and

‘force a Fumble which he reco-

vered.

Davidson took possession on
the Buccanneers’ eight yard line.
Freshman quarterback Peter
Hughes, who had replaced senior
starter Steve Bradley, took just
two plays to get the Cats in the end

East Tennessee State runs over Davidson, 41-16
;

their first possession of the third |
quarter and run the score to 28-9.

Davidson’s defense stiffened
for the remainder _of the quarter,
but the Wildcat offense was not
able to cut into the Buccanneer
lead. aN

The play that broke David-
son’s back came with less than 30
seconds gone in the fourth quar-
ter. Stewart recovered a Buccan-
neer fumble at the ETSU 20 yard
line.

Bradley moved the Cats to the
ETSU seven yard line. He then
threw a pass into the end zone, in-
tended. for sophomore running
back Bryan Overcash, but it was
‘picked off a Buccanneer defender
and returned the full 100 yards for
a touchdown. After the point-after
attempt failed, ETSU led 34-9 and
the door was essentially stiut on

‘ the Wildcats.

The Buccanneers added one
more touchdown on their next
possession to close out their scor-
ing at 41.

‘Davidson managed one more

was good just as time expired.
ETSU opened the second half
scoring, going 55 yards in just six
plays to notch a touchdown on

at 41-16. .

Davidson has an open date this
weekend. They are probably

Volleyball celebrates first ever varisity victory

By SUSAN WILKINS
The women’s volleyball team
celebrated its-first win‘of the sea-
son against Belmont Abbey in an

away match Monday night. They

The women’s cross country prepares for tomorrow's meet

came back from a first game loss
to win the second and third games,
winning 15-0 and 15-8 respec-
tively.

According. to coach Sue

Hayes, “the Ladycats goal has
been to improve each game; scor-
ing more points and playing more
as a teani.”” ;

So far this goal has not been

__the ball and, consequently, lost.0

out of reach. In every match the
Wildcats have played they have
had fun as well as improving their
scores.

Monday night’s second match
against Mars Hill is a prime exam-
ple of the Cats’ improvement.

In the first game of the best of
three series, the volleyball team
played as if they were scared of

15. In the second game the team
rallied to come from behind and
gave the Mars Hill players a scare.
Although the Cats ended up losing
the game 12-15, they showed en-
thusiasm and functioned as a well-
playing team..

Although the Wildcats are a
young and inexperienced team,
some players ate performing espe-
cially well. Among these are
freshman Sarah Johnson and
sophomore Maria Douglas, two of
the teams most solid setters. Con-
sistent and strong serving is pro-

vided by both freshman Kathy -

MacDonald and/ senior Bonnie

Bolton. On the front line, junior
Beth Elder is playing well.

Thursday night the Ladycats
played’Appalachian State Univer-
sity. Appalachian is ranked
number one in the Southern Con-
ference.

Hayes expected a tough match
and got it. Davidson scored two
points in three games against the
powerful Mountaineers. »

Although they played well in
spurts, the Wildcats lacked cohe-
siveness throughout most of the
match. Davidson looked tentative ©
and disorganized; the scores of the
‘games — 15-2, 15-0, 15-0 — re-
flected this hesitancy. —

Towards the end of the third
game, the Cats came alive, hold-
ing off two match points. Douglas
and senior Michelle Miller played
well in delaying the loss.
