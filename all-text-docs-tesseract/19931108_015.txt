Cat Nips: Jason Byassee

On the eighth day, God created Basketball, and it was good

By Jason Byassee

Now, its hard to notice, but if
you pay attention you can pick up
on it. Its easy to lose it amidst all
the November excitement over
football, what with the birth of the
Carolina Panthers and with the Tar
Heels kicking butt on the gridiron
for the second straight season.

Right now the sound is merely a
hum, one that’ll grow to a buzz by
December, a low roar after the
New Year and a veritable explo-
sion come March.

It’s the sound of dribbling--
basketball, that is. The NBA began
regular season play this past week-
end, and area college teams have

just recently begun practicing.
Now, football has its place and all
and I enjoy following it, but only
as a way to pass the time till
roundball. Now I’m excited, the
sport that God made is fixin’ to
kick in.

The first indicator was when
the weather began to grow cold as
fall arrived. When I was a kid that
meant it was time to get out and
practice the jumpshot, for hoops
was on its way. It didn’t matter
that it got dark early; we’d find a
streetlight and play until forever.
My dad wasn’t about to call us in,
since he was out there with us.

You see, basketball has this
unifying aspect to it, as exempli-
fied by my family. A holiday just
wasn’t celebrated properly if it
didn’t involve several hours of
hoops between me and my dad and
my brothers. We all played the
same way: weshottoo much, talked
too much junk and thought we
were better players than we were.
The family grudge matches would
last for hours, and they were great.
We were fans, too. During the sea-
son when Duke or Carolina were
on television the Byassee family
living room would be. filled with
friends, popcorn and lots of yell-
ing. You see, our family consisted
of one Carolina grad, one former
Duke employee and three kids that
wavered in loyalty between the
two shades of blue. I personally

ended up a Blue Devil fan, which
of course meant I enjoyed watch-
ing Carolina-Duke games more
often than not. And as soon as
halftime hit we were off, using
those precious twenty minutes to
play ball and dissect the first half.
For our family, basketball was
one of those crucial things that
glues individuals together. My dad
and I could have a huge fight, and
then get over it by beating each
other up on the basketball court.
An hour later we’d emerge, laugh-
ing, with father-son relationship
healed and even strengthened.
Hoops provided a means of
measuring of growth as well. I
remember when I first beat my dad
in one-on-one, when my younger
brother learned how to score on me
without my letting him, and when
the youngest could sticka jumpshot
from further than ten feet away.
As we grew older, the level of
basketball intensified, of course.
A bunch of buddies and I got a
recreation team together and as
upper-middle class, sons of
WASPs, Chapel Hill kids went and
signed up to play in what was es-
sentially an urban, ghetto basket-
ball league in downtown Durham.
My dad, ever faithful, paced the
sidelines as our head coach, and
my friends and I scratched and
clawed to pull out a handful victo-
ries in our four years of play.
What strikes me about that

league is one of the most impres-
sive things about basketball: its
universal appeal. I don’t know
when else I would have had real
contact with African-Americans,
other than on the basketball court.
Even now, if we’re honest, most of
us do not take the time to build
friendships with people of other
races. But after two hours of all-
out warfare on the court, you walk
away with real respect for the guy
that played opposite you, no mat-
ter what color his face is. In a
society in which churches, institu-
tions and even schools are still
very segregated, basketball brings
folks together.

Then there were the times
when basketball helped me relate
to folks in entirely different cul-
tures. One summer I spent a few
weeks in Guatemala, and once
found an inner-city basketball
game there. I talkeda little Spanish
smack with the locals, knocked
down a few jumpers and basically
had my ego pampered, since com-
pared to Guatemalan school kids I
look like Larry Johnson. Another
bridge provided by the game.

I also spent the past few sum-
mers in Boston, and discovered
that even Yankees play basketball. .
They foul too much and talk even
more than I do, but they still play.
Now that’s cross cultural.
