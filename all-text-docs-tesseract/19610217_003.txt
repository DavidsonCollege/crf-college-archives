A Man Of Few Words

THE MAN called “Mr. Frank” was here Tuesday in

all his eloquence, But the U. N. trouble-shooter isn’t
always flowers. Ask Olin Puckett, biology professor. The

two men happened together at a recent meeting. “Hello,
Dr. Graham,” Puckett said. Came the reply, “How's

BUT FOOTBALL'S in the background now. Even

basketball is on the fade-out. And maybe that Spring
Frolics weather we've been having isn’t premature.

THEY WON'T let Paul Marrotte quit. The history |
professor and ex-soccer coach (he resigned last fall) was
back on the field Wednesday for a two-week, winter |
warm-up. Marrotte says he’s hoping to pull a leave next}
semester and he adds this note: “Do you remember how
Jimmy Durante used to sign-off his TV show with, ‘Good- |
night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are’? Well, rumor is
that the man in line for the soccer coaching job for 1961

is none other than ‘Mr. Calabash, whoever he is’.

PETE WHITTLE made his getaway last month—
after 31 straight years at the grind (track and cross- |
country, physical education, and most anything else that
required a competent man at the helm). He’ll be back in
September, with all sorts of gimmicks from a semester
of study..A possible sample, one that he was mulling
over before he left, is the tow method in track training.
A metal bar is fastened to the rear bumper of a car. The
car pulls runners at speeds greater than their capacities
and helps develop their sprint times.

SINCE THIS column is being written before the
Davidson-Virginia Tech basketball game, | can report
only what has gone before. And that you wouldn't print
on a Valentine card, not even one from Hallmark. The
football Wildcats stunned everybody with a 9-7 upset
over top-ranked VPI. Davidson returned to Blacksburg
in December, this time in basketball togs, and was
soundly beaten, 105-59. Fans piling over balconies in
the Tin Can Arena roared their approval and _
Gobbler gridders seated behind our basket stopped jus
short of or physical force on the Wildcats. It was
nightmarish and Coach Lefty Driesell has vowed not to
go back. Last night it was our turn...

LEFTY’S NOT the only wet hen. His cohort, Joe
Hunt, suffered through a 67-63 freshman defeat |at

Pfeiffer last week. It came after five t victories.
And what’s more, the referees were Pfeiffer students.

We fouled out.

Of Dances And Sex Books

YOU'VE PROBABLY wondered about the four
straight cage games Davidson won through last Thurs-
day. Are we really that good? The victims—VMI, Wof-:
ford and Pfeiffer (twice)—were ly scheduled for

the two-week period between exams and the dance week-
end. “We've found,” said Tom Scott, “that the boys are
lowest during that period. So we schedule the weaker
teams.

FAVORED CAROLINA IS HOST

Untried Cindermen Go
Inside Tomorrow For
State’s Big Five Meet

By JOHN SPRATT
Davidsonian Sports Writer

A dubious Coach Roger Thrift leads his Wildcat trackmen into their indoor
debut with Carolina, Wake Forest, Duke, and North Carolina State in the Big Five
Meet tomorrow in Chapel Hill.

Explains Thrift, “We can’t
enter enough boys to do too
well . . . for instance we lost
our miler David Gilmour, and
we have no pole vaulters.

“It’s hard to tell, though; we
haven't had enough time. And
also the bad weather's hurt
us, making us practice a lot in
Chambers. And you can't get
in shape in Chambers.”

’Cats At Furman Tomorrow
—

By STEVE CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Writer

A tired, but fired up Davidson College basketball
team travels to Greenville, S. C., tomorrow night for a
revenge battle with the high-scoring Paladins of Furman

the ’Cats at Davidson back

such anties as travelling, three-
second violation, bad passes,
and other ulcer-provoking feats.
In addition the shorter
Spiders outrebounded, outshot,
and outhustled the visiting
‘Cats. In short, Richmond
wanted the game more.
SHINN SHINES
Following the game, Coach
“Lefty” Driesell criticized his
team for their play. He stated,

“Bill. Shinn and D. G. Martin
were the only ones who put
out tonight.”

Shinn popped in 12 field
goals for a high of 24 points,
while Martin hustled on de-
fense and contributed six
points. Bill Jarman and Joe

Markee had off-nights, as the
former scored but one point in
the first half and ten for the
night, while the latter was held
to 13.

Tomorrow night's opponent
is a team with tremendous po-
tential. The Paladins, young
and quick, had a 13-8 record as
of Wednesday. They currently
hold down fourth place in the
tough Southern Conference,
and will rate the role of “dark
horse” in the upcoming tourna-
ment.

FAST-BREAKERS

Furman moves the ball down
the court in a hurry and
wastes no time trying to score.
Led by sophomore sensation
Jerry Smith, the Paladins fast-
break a lot. Consequently, four
of their starters average in the
double figures.

Smith is currently the fourth
best scorer in the conference
(32nd in the nation) with a 21.3

average. Tuesday night, the
young candidate for all-con-
ference honors, paced _ the

Paladins over South Carolina,
93-78.
