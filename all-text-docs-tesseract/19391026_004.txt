ing world first. A footbattupset : world of fandom
as much as a bomb rocks the other continent.

Last week Knoxville saw one of the greatest games
of the season take place in its own backyard. In our
estimation Tennessee won a Bowl bid on that game. The
Vols still have tough hurdles to go over in L. S. U. and
Kentucky, but the team that beat Alabama last week can
beat them both. Vanderbilt and Auburn will be no push-
overs, but with Tennessee’s team at its height the Vols
should have no trouble there. Last year Tennessee missed
out on the Rose Bowl bid as Duke received the coveted
honor, and if the Knoxville boys remain undefeated once
more, they appear to be standout candidates for the bid
this year, especially after missing it last season. Of
course some northern or eastern team can still remain
undefeated: and untied and win the honors, but we’re on
the well-known‘limb! ~
