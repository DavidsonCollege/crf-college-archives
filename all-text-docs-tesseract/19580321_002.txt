Lets Prevent Future
Tension Building Events

One thing is evidently clear as we
reflect on last week's climax to the
continued social crisis on the David-
son campus: the gross lack of inter-
communication and mutual under-
standing between the rank and file
of students on the one hand, and the
faculty and administration leaders on
the other.

Last week we saw clearly that a
wide gulf does exist between the
faculty and students. This is the fault
of no particular person—it’s just a
fact that has long been in the making.

_ Granted that we should encourage
more communication between the
mass of students and the faculty. the
DAVIDSONIAN believes that a few
simple actions could help bring the
students and faculty into a greater
understanding of each other. To do
this, we suggest:

1. That fraternities step up the
practice of having faculty members
down to the boarding houses for
meals. It only makes good sense that
to gain the sympathy of the faculty,
‘the fraternities must show them some
interest and courtesy.

If every chapter on campus will
make it a standard practice to enter-
tain at meals and occasionally at a
general ‘feed’ night, then the pro-
fessors could not but help to grow
more enthusiastically in favor of the
fraternities The dividends .should be
greatly worth while.

2. That students take fuller ad-
vantage of the Sunday night. visiting
tradition in faculty homes, It is often
surprising and satisfving to learn how
different a professor is in the atmos-

phere of his home.

Here is a good place to know a
professor as a friend and not as an
intellectual machine that spouts from
the lecture platform.

3. That, professors and students
take the initiative to establish clubs
on the order of the Business-Eco-
nomics Association and Alpha Epsilon
Delta (medical fraternity) where stu-
dents and faculty can interchange
ideas related to their fields of interest.

Along this same line, some pro-
fessors should make a greater attempt
to relate their courses to the world in
which we live They should show just
what meaning it has for today’s stu-
dent.

Stale lectures not only demoralize
the student. but are contributory to

the gulf that exists between the stu-
dent and faculty. It is evident that

the most respected and well-liked pro-
fessors are those who give their stu-
dents vital and imaginative lectures—
ones that make him think, not just
memorize.

4. That every student go out of
his way to let the professors and ad-
ministration leaders know what he is
thinking. Don't shun away from them
over a cup of coffee in the Union.
They are interested in knowing what
the students are thinking. Give them
an opportunity to communicate with
the students.

These then are some suggestions
that may be helpful in establishing
better communications between the
students and the faculty. Mavbe a bet-
ter uriderstanding of each other will
cancel any chance of future tensions
and crisises.

Student-Faculty
Crisis Passes

What could have grown into a
serious student-faculty crisis passed
into history last Friday afternoon as
the full faculty met to hear the frater-
nity presidents. and IFC representa-
tives present their case concerning.
the excesses of the previous Wednes-
day’s Skit Night.

The whole matter began on Thurs-
day night when the Executive Com-
mittee (the college's disciplinary
body) called student leaders together.
told them of their decision to suspend
Hell Week, and then gave the students
a chance to state their side of the
case.

After a long discussion the Execu-
tive Committee rescinded its action
and said that they would permit Hell
Week to continue until the next aft-
ernoon when the entire faculty would
decide the issue—whether to suspend
Hell Week because of the indiscre-
tions at Skit Night.

Then came the Friday afternoon
meeting with the full faculty.

The whole meeting was conducted
for the greater part in a sense of sin-
cere cooperation and friendliness. The
initial sympathetic attitude shown by
most of the faculty members who
spoke out not only gave the students
a relieved feeling, but stimulated

them to consider the Skit Night affair
in a more objective manner.

What began as a doubtful and
even resentful attitude by many
ended up with almost everyone all
smiles. This feeling of cordiality was
due mainly to the unexpected, open-

minded position that the faculty took.
They did not prejudice themselves

before thev heard the facts. This the
students appreciated.

When it was all over, the result
was the approval of a substitute mo-
tion by the faculty to turn the whole
affair over to the IFC. As for the
punitive disciplinary action, they
voted to end Hell Week one day early
—which in itself was not a bad idea.

The DAVIDSONIAN is glad to see
that students and faculty can sit down
together and work out their misunder-
standings in a mature way. This is
further proof that the “Davidson
Gentleman” still has the right. stuff
in him.

Inter-Com For

Duke Dorm

All the dormitories have adequate
telephone service except the center
section of Duke Dorm. There are, how-
ver, two phones in Duke—one in each
of the end sections. What is needed
is some means of communication be-

|

tween the center section and the two

end sections.
If the college would install an in-
ter-com system, similar to the one in

Cannon and East, calls would be com-
pleted a lot more easily and con:
veniently.

By One Vote

Already this year in the elections,
some candidates have been dropped
in the eliminations by one vote. Last
year, some candidates won the office
by one vote.

It is obvious, therefore, that- your
individual vote will verv likely be the
one that determines the winner.

The job of the editor of
Quips and Cranks is to repre-
sent and coordinate the diversi-
fied areas of Davidson life and
activity in the annual publica-
tion,. while specializing in ma-
terial that will be of lasting
valuo to the graduating class to
whom it is especially dedicated.

IDEAL

As a source of information
and reference, it is as gond as
it is accurate. For facility of
use it must be well organized.
As an ideal, the yearbook is a
pictorial catalogue, depicting
artistically and as acceptably
as possible the Davidson scene.

Since the content is, by the
nature of the book. largely the
same. eich year, it is in the
aspects mentioned — organiza-
tion and presentation — that
the editor can show originality
and _ ability.

While the work of the edi-

tor is paramount, he cannot ef-
fectively produce without the
support.and cooperation of the
staff and of the entire college
family.

Through my experience with
past staffs I have developed
some ideas that I hope to in-
corporate into the 1959 Quips
and Cranks. Through my own
efforts I am prepared to facili-
tate in whatever capacity the
making of next year's book.

While the editorship is a dis-
tinct honor, it is also a respon-
sibility requiring the devoted
efforts of the individual elected.
I shall endeavor to fulfil the
responsibility, should I be so
honored.

Sam Smith

The purpose of an annual is
to present a pictorial history of
a particular school year. It is
therefore the responsibility of

the editor to include all impor-
tant aspects of the year in the
annual. I believe that the year
book should be highly  sec-
tionalized to avoid sporadic
confusion in attempts to pre-
sent the year chronologically.

Preferential Bidding Aired

Dear Editor:

Preferential bidding, as it was
outlined in the DAVIDSONIAN
and in the discussion led by
Dr. McGavock, if connected
with a limit on the size of a
fraternity, will undoubtedly cor-
rect some of the so-called
“evils” of the fraternity system
in general and will strengthen
tha system as it is found here
at Davidson.

CLOSER-KNIT

First, by limiting the overall
size of a fraternity, especially
if this size were to be between
50-60, as Dr, McGavock suggest-
ed, a closer-knit group with a
real fraternity spirit could’ be
more readily effected. It is gen-
erally recognized that the av-
erage fraternity on the David-
son campus is too large to ac-
complish its real purpose. If
the enroliment goes up to 1000
students without the introduc-
tion of new fraternities, the
size of the fraternities will con-
tinue to increase until some-
thing is done to check their
growth.

Secondly, the individual
fraternities would be bene-
fitted by a preferential sys-
tem because of the actual
increase in the amount of
choice they would have in
selecting pledges. Under the

PEANUTS

PEANE LS

present system, all the
choice, except for a straight
“we want you” or “we don’t
want you” by the fraterni-
ties, resides in the rushee.

If a preferential system were
passed, a fraternity could then
safely bid those boys whom
they were not as eager to get.
By placing them far enough
down their list of preferences,
the fraternity would get them
only if they needed them to ful-
fill their quota.

SECOND CHOICE

Now, with the rushee having
all the choice, a fraternity is
forced to bid rushees they do
not particularly want in order
to compensate in case enough
of the first choice rushees co
not pledge. Now, also, the odds,
are strong that these second.
choice rushees will pledge and
enter a fraternity where they
are not particularly wanted. Un-
der a preferential system, these
rushees would have the oppor:
tunity to pledge only under ecx-
treme circumstances. In this
way’ also would the fraternity
spirit be strengthened by mak-
ing it possible to pledge only
those boys that a fraternity real-
ly wanted.

The third edvantage of
having a preferential bid-
ding system with a limit on

size is that it would
strengthen immeasurably
the independent group on
campus. This would be done
principally by entarging
this group, which now con-
stitutes only about ten per
cent of the enroliment. A
strong independent group
would reduce considerably
the pressure to join a fra-
ternity regardiess of wheth-
er or not you could afford
to or even particularly
wanted to.

I imagine we would all agree
that a strong independent
group would help to strengthen
the fraternity system itself, for
it would tend to ‘keep out of
fraternities those individuals
who do not really want to join
and who, once in, do not con-
tribute their part to the fra-
ternity but only act as drags
on its progress.

1.F.C,

Such a preferential bidding
system, reinforced by limita-
tions on the size of fraternities,
should logically come from the
IFC. The sooner the IFC takes
such a step, the sooner the Da-
vidson fraternity system can
reassert itself as a positive fra-
ternal force.

tor’s job. The editor should
present, not only a condensa-
tion of the activities of a school
year, but also the unique quali-
ty of that particular year.

Too often, however, only the
main events and personages ap-
pear on the annual pages. Too
often the distinctiveness of a
year is not presented as such,
but is only mirrored in organi-
zations and main events. This
distinctiveness is found, not in
organizations, but in the ideals

‘and activities of the student

body as a whole.

STUDENT SECTION

If elected, I therefore pro-
pose to present Davidson, 1958-
59, with its classes, organiza-
tions, fraternities, sports, and
honoraries; but I also propose
to present the student body in
a section specifically set aside
for that purpose. Such is my
platform; thank you for reading
it.

COFFEE BREAK

D.C. ‘Gentleman’
Anachronistic

By BOB JONES

Recently the faculty arraigned the fraternities for
“displaying action unbecoming Davidson Gentlemen” dur-
ing the course of Skit Nite. While few would deny that
certain extremes of Skit Nite went even beyond the limits
of propriety accepted by the students, the concept of the
Davidson Gentleman is a lost one and not legitimately ap-
plicable as the criterion of any disciplinary action.

As a normative standard the older generation en-
visions in “The Davidson Gentleman” criterion which
brings no response in the frame of reference of the

_ contemporary student. Operating on the basis of a
dead concept is anachronistic.

What this exemplifies is actually what is here termed
to be the concept of “level living.” Members of society
operate on certain social, religious, economic, and in-
tellectual levels. The fundamental difficulty with the Da-
vidson student body lies in the fact that in this time of

“other direction,”

when our actions and_ attitudes

are ruled by the judgment of our peers, the prevail-
ing level dictated by group opinion is relatively low in
comparison with the shibboleth “Davidson Gentleman,”
and (in more relevant terms) with regard to the level
at which a first class college should operate.

Intellectual and social activity has stagnated on
Davidson’s particular level, and motivation to evolve
to a higher and more challenging level is continually
crushed. In the trend of the election of student body
officers this is particularly exemplified. Those who
win are generally those who are the idealization of
activity on the aecepted level; those who are motiva-
ted to higher levels are generally ostracized and con-
demned for not conforming to the group.

Unfortunately, stagnation prevails over the entire
academic community, faculty as well as students. Hence
in drawing a judgment one does not know where the
blame really lies. The accepted level has become so in-
grained in the Davidson community of faculty and stu-
dents that the dynamics of the concept is continually

circular.

It is necessary that some new quality be inject-
od into this prevailing level. This can come from but
two sources and will take a combination of hoth to

accomplish anything worthwhile.

Either inner-di-

rected students who display sufficient leadership and
interest must create a meliorated atmosphere; or a
sufficiently resolved faculty, which is willing to take
a stand for what it considers the best interest of the
college, will hold to a position with enough gumption
so that those students who are capable of higher

levels will be encouraged.

In this matter the concept of a Davidson Gentleman
may be revitalized, and alumni, perhaps, will be able to
look back at the college of which they were so cynical
and say, “Davidson does make a difference.”

Letter Clarifies
Demagogue Bit

Dear Editor:

I would like here to clarify
some points about my article
last week on the “Dying Dema-
gogue.” It was not intended in
any way to be malicious: it was.
however, very poorly judged.

POPULAR ON CAMPUS

This student is probably one
of the most popular boys on
campus, and for this reason he
was a natural choice for the
first in the series. Although he
does have some semblance. of
those characteristics = which
were mentioned, he has a great
many other characteristics and

these were chosen only because
they were morc subject to
exaggeration,

My intention was to btow
these properties up out of all
realistic proportions. No one
should have had the feeling
that this was a true picture, for
it was intended as an extreme
carieature. The article was by
turns poetic, and pun-ish; after
taking certain properties, it
worked them over with the in-
tent of being clever, and rare-
ly returned to its original sub-
Ject after the start. It was hoped
that all who read it would
realize that this was a farcical
distortion, meant to laugh with,
rather than at.

KIDDING NOT APPARENT

It was poorly done. My man-
ner of facetious kidding did not
becpme apparent on the print-
ed page. What was intended as
friendly and exaggerated beyond
any reality did not appear so
when read. However, this was
the spirit intended, and I hope
any who misunderstood now un-
derstaad.
