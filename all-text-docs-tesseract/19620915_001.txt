Administration Juggled; r
Seven Augment Faculty)

Davidson significantly revamped several aspects of the administration this past |

June.

The move that made Robert
J. Sailstad Director of Public
Relations and Development
placed three formerly independ-
ent sections of the administra-
tion under one head. Sailstad in
his new position will have re-
sponsibility for the coordination
of all areas of the administra-
tion that represents the college
to the public, including the work
of the Alumni Office, the Col-
lege News Bureau, and the
financial development program.
Sailstad has been at Davidson
the past six years as Assistant
to the President for Develop-
ment.

President D. G. Martin said
of the change, “This reorgani-
zation will, we believe, allow
Davidson to fulfill better its
obligation to this area and
those it serves throughout the
nation.” Business Manager
Robert A. Currie said that the
reorganization would make it
possible to eliminate the need-
less duplication of records
that the three previous de-
partments made necessary.

Assisting Sailstad in his new

duties are W. Taylor Blackwell,

the director of news bureau and
publicity, and John Goodman,
acting director of alumni activi-
ties. William L. Bondurant, last
year’s assistant director of ad-
missions, will arrive from a tour
with the Army Reserves this
December to take the job as
director of alumni activities.
Bondurant graduated from Dav-
idson with the class of 58 and
has an LL.B. degree from Duke
University.

Gone from the scene is John
Horton, who had been serving
as director of alumni affairs
since 1958.

Replacing Sailstad as Presi-
dent Martin’s assistant is Ever-
ett Gourley, Jr. Prior to his ar-
rival here, Gourley was assist-
ant to the president at Queens
College in Charlotte. Gourley
received his A.B. from Vander-
bilt‘University and then served
as a missionary in Brazil from
1953-56. In 1956 he was appoint-
ed to the Presbyterian Board of
World Missions. He left this
post in 1959 to attend the Pres-
byterian School of Christian
Education in Richmond, Va

Russell Kirk Views

Dr. Russell Kirk, noted author and lecturer, will
speak on “The Future of American Conservatism” in

chapel Tuesday at 10:20 a.m.

His appearance, which will be
followed by a coffee hour in the
Student Union, is being spon-
sored by the Davidson College
Conservative Club and the na-
tional organization with which
it is associated, the Intercolleg-
iate Society of Individualists.

Dr. Kirk did his undergrad-
uate work at Michigan State
University receiving an A.B.
degree in 1940. His graduate
work was continued at Duke
University (MA) and completed
at St. Andrews University in
Scotland, which awarded him a
doctor of letters degree. He is

He is currently research pro-
fessor of political science at
C. W. Post College and univer-
sity professor at Long Island
University.

Looked upon by many as the
philosopher of American Con-
servatism, Prof. Kirk is primar-
ily a writer: He is the author of
many books, the best known of
them being The Conservative
Mind.

Dr. Kirk was the founder of
the quarterly journal Modern
Age and is now the editor of the
quarterly University Bookman.
He contributes frequently to the
New York Times Magazine, For-
tune, National Review, Wall St.
Journal, Yale Review, and num-
erous other publications.

Training for the new ROTC
flight training program is sched-
uled to begin during the week
of Sept. 24 at the Mooresville
Airport.

After passing rigid physical
requirements and aptitude tests,

seven Davidson seniors have

been accepted into the program.

Gourley said, “Mr. Sailstad had
so many duties to perform with |
the development of the college
and raising money for it that he!
had no time to assist the presi-|

dent in other matters. The very
fact that he did his job so well
meant that the president had
even more work. Mr. Sailstad
can continue his excellent work |
in development and President
Martin will a true

Four other changes have al-

Davidson Graduate
in Chaplain's Office

Rev. William. H. Terry as-
sumes the position of chaplain |
at Davidson this semester. He |
succeeds Dr. George Staples who
is engaged in  post-doctrinal |

work at Yale University.

The Durham native was grad-|
uated from Davidson in 1954. As |
an umdergraduate he was a
member of Sigma Phi Epsilon
social fraternity and president
of the Eumenean Literary So-
ciety. He was named to Who's
Who in American Colleges and
Universities his senior year.
In the year immediately fol-|
lowing his graduation the Rev.
‘Mr. Terry held the position of
YMCA secretary, a job very |
similar to his present post. Dur-|
ing this year he was tapped to
ODK.
The new chaplain «sees the
chaplain’s office as “primarily
pastoral in nature and not ad-
ministrative .. . and as an Op-
portunity to get to know stud-/

ents better.”

Congolese Student
Enters As Pre-Med

BY KNOX ABERNETHY

Davidsonian

In the pre-dawn darkness of June 16,

Staff Writer

1961.

Congolese disembarked from their flight from Leopold-
ville at New York International Airport. There were two

pastors, a teacher, and a pre-med student named Ben,

Nzengu, now a Freshman here at Davidson.

A couple of them could speak
a few words of English, but none
of the officials at the airport
could understand them. A guide,
who spoke a little French, heip-
ed them get through customs
and immigration formalities, and
then they were suddenly alone
in the vastness of the airport.
Ben says now, “We looked at
one way and thought that may-
be it would take us out of the
airport. Then we looked that
way and then another way, and
then all the ways looked the
same. We were really lost.”
Then he heard
calling his name,

someone
and he

_ thought, “How could anyone

know my name here?” He

looked around and there was |

his sponsor, John Cooley of
Nashville, Tenn.

And. that. was how Ben first
entered the United States. He
had just left Leopoldville the
previous afternoon, and less
than a week before he had left
his home in Bebanga, of the
Kasai province of the Republic
of the Congo.

Ben, who is of the Baluba
tribe of South Kasai, is the son
of a Presbyterian minister
(like many Davidson students),
and he began his education at
the Presbyterian mission ele-
mentary school at Kasha. He
studied there for seven years
and graduated in 1956.

He then went to the Ecole
d'Infirmiers Diplome in Lubon-
dia, where he took the entrance
examinations with twenty other
students. Seventeen, including
Ben, passed the exams and be-
gan a five-year course in medi-
cine under Dr. William Rule,
who is a medical missionary of

independence, however, the Lu-
lua, fired: with tribal pride,
drove all the Baluba people
from Lalua territory.

Ben, studying in Lubondai,
was caught in the middle of
the turmoil. Although there
was much fighting and blood-
shed, the students of the mis-
sion hospital quietly returned
home when the Lulua ordered
them out. Ben returned to
Bebanga, where he continued
his studies in the mission hos-
pital there, under the direc-
tion of Dr. Hugh Farrior, an-
nother Presbyterian mission-
ary and a Davidson alumnus.

Seven of the original class of
seventeen finished the course,

and all but one went to work
