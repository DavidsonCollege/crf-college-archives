False Pictures

Recently there has been a deluge of sensa-
tional articles and pictures that are supposed
to be typical of the college fraternity life.
These by no means give the true picture of
life in our Greek letter fraternities and some
action should be taken to stop this flood of
harmful publicity. This is: one of the big -
problems facing our fraternities today.

_-Much harm is done through the exploited
incidents of “EJell Week" and false impressions
of our dances and sccial affairs. This gives _
false ideas of fraternity life to the public and is
one of the chief sources of parental objection
that offers an obstacle to the pledging | of men_

Brumbaugh said that one, possible
answer might be that they parti-
cipate more in extra-curricular ac-
tivities than men do. ‘He didn't of-
fer other possible explanations.

a significant ‘difference in the grad-

es fOr point credit; and those who
only went to class. often enough to
get “R's”. However, there was some
difference between women in the
upper grade brackets and women
who only got average grades.

Dean Brumbaugh’s reason for
publishing the survey was so stu-
dents could know the®effects of
taking advantage of the New Plan.
He was not advocating that “stu-
dents go to classes if they didn’t
want to. He promised that no ac-
tion to make them go would be
taken, but he said that students
should at least know what the ef-
fects of their action would be.
