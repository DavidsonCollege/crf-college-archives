Restaurant Review
Jasper’s isn’t
worth it —

90 for Fuzion

instead

By Mary CLareE JALONICK
Executive Editor

The Friday night dinner routine.

Person 1: OK, so wheredoy’all

want to go?

Person 2: I don’t care.

Person 3: Doesn’t matter to me.

Person 1: What does everyone

want?

Person 3: Brueger’s? .

Person I: I ate there this

morning.

Person 2: Me too.

Person 3: Oh.

Person 4; Oh.

Person |: Anyone have a good

idea?

Person 4: Not really.

Person 2: No.

We've all been through it —
the options here are minimal and the
decisions tedious. (Atthe same time,
we become immersed in the routine,
and one hardly knows what to do
when away from Davidson—no
Honeylite Smoked Turkey melt? No
Gringo dip? no Empress of China
buffet (ugh)?) But Hidden among
Exit 28 delicacies like the Arch De-
luxe, BK Big Fish, Chicken n’ bis-
cuits and the fatback container at
Prime (the horror!) are some surpris-
ingly unique and tasty hideouts.

Two restaurants attracted sev-
eral student families this weekend
— Fuzion in Cornelius and Jasper’s
in Davidson. They couldn’t be more
different. Fuzion is excellent, while
Jasper’s lacks the menu variety or
tasty food to justify the high prices.

A mix of Asian, Italian, Cajun
and Creole, the menu at Fuzion
(Cornelius, across from the Stock
Car Café) is delicious. Our group
ordered wonderful meals all around.
For appetizers we shared a big bread
boule of Creole Crab and Spinach
dip as well as Crawfish rolls, a sort
of seafood egg roll. Friends ordered
the Thai Chicken Pizza, Hawaiian
Ribeye with garlicky potatoes and
the Mongolian Steak Salad. Other
enticing menu options include grilled
portobello mushrooms, California
Veggie Pizza, Curry Chicken
Alfredo and Paella di Toscana (a
true ethnic mix).

Co-owner Anthony Marciante,
who comes from Italian background,
owns the restaurant with two old
friends, brothers Hing Kwan Yim
and Hing Yip Yim from Hong Kong.
“T grew up with my partners, and our
friends were from _all around the
world,” Marciante says, “There is
lots of good food out there, and there
is no sense in having food from just
one category.”

They employ the trend of fu-
sion cooking but try to avoid cook-
ing different ethnic dishes solely for
the purpose of cooking different eth-
nic dishes. “We try to cook food that
makes sense — food that goes to-
gether. We want the menu to be
harmonious,” says Marciante.

Pastas and main dishes range
from $9.95 to $16.95, while pizzas

Worth more than Three

Musical entertains students and parents alike

By Mary Tow.es ALLISON
Staff Writer

The Davidson College theater
department presented The Three
Penny Opera just in time for par-
ents weekend. Although the play
had been showing since Wednes-
day night, the cast showed no signs
of exhaustion by Friday, as
they pounded out number
after number for the full
house.

Students and their par-
ents were entertained dur-
ing the two and a half hour
performance by a notori-
ous criminal and his “staff”
of underhanded conspira-
tors, a brothel of prosti-
tutes, and afew corruptciti-
zens of London. The cast
entranced the crowd with
strong voices and astound-
ing portrayals of these ap-
pealing, yet fraudulent
characters.

First, aquick summary
of the story. Mac the Knife ff,
is a bandit that has been ff
wreaking havoc upon the §
city of London for some ff
time.

His most infamous ac-

tivities not only include
thievery and murder, but

also a liking for a brothel
on the shoddy side of town.
His current act of ill-re-
pute, which serves as the
main story in play, is the
wooing of Polly Peachum,
who he marries on the sly.

Disapproving of this
sudden marriage, the
Peachums, conservative
and conscientious parents
that they are, wish to un-
veil the malignant side of
Macheath and in doing so

titute, Jenny, betrays him and re-
veals his whereabouts to the au-
thorities. After much confusion
and chaos, the police decide to
hang the criminal.

However, just before Mac
meets an unfortunate (or fortu-
nate?) end, the queen orders the

execution to be cancelled and asks -

sweeps Polly into his arms.

Ah, the perfect happy ending.
But not quite. The story leaves the
audience with a somewhat unre-
solved ending. Mackheath had also
married the commissioner of
potice’s daughter, who stands aside
looking quite put out that her biga-
mous husbandis still alive. Polly’s

Jose Ruiz sings about the joys of being a begger’s big brother. :

Mac the Knife’s swagger down
pat; he was confident, yet sneaky
—a perfect gentleman and a con-
niving crook, made to sweep inno-
cent girls off their feet.

The Peachums, played by Iva
Taylor and Jose Ruiz, comple-
mented one another through their
songs and their acting. Polly (Katie
Parker) and Lucy (Kate
Scibal) played up their
competitive statuses, as
they fought for Mac the
Knife, and Jess Robblee
did quite a convincing por-
trayal of Jenny, the head
prostitute.

‘ Even the more minor
| roles augmented the story
4 and acted as an interesting
9 diversion from the rest of
4 the musical. Mackheath’s
| gang stumbled around on
} stage creating bedlam for
4 the rest of the cast; which
| kept the crowd in stitches.
; Filch, a beggar played
by Vic Brand, succeeded
in annoying Mr. Peachum,
| and entertaining the audi-
ence. Matthew Nixon, a
street singer, quipped wit-
== | tily throughout the show
Se.-| to add to the ambiance.
The cast also had an
a impressive handle on the
musical aspect of the show.
The songs were difficult
sounding German pieces,
with quick beats and stac-
cato styles.
The entire cast had a won-
# derful grasp of the music
and the way it should be
integrated into the play.
Bes) Also impressive was the
small instrumental en-
semble that accompanied

Ben Delisa the actors and actresses.

This difficult job also

break the spell of love by which
their daughter is entranced.

After a few humorous, but
failed attempts to catch Mac at the
game he plays best, the head pros-

the police of London to set
Macheath free. Mac the Knife
then swaggers down from the ex-
ecution stand, as if he was sure of
his ‘safety the entire time, and

parents are also disgruntled with
his freedom. Oh well, everyone
can’t always get their way, right?

The entire cast performed
amazingly well. Austin Rios had

helped make the performance a hit
with the crowd. Allin all, the show
was a great success and came off
like one of Mackheath’s schemes:
without a hitch.

Tribal Gathering

students congregate to hear Indian story teller

By Becky LATANICH
Staff Writer

In an effort to bring multi-
cultural awareness to the Davidson
student body, the Union Cultural
Events Committee sponsored a
storytelling in honor of Native
American Week, Wednesday
evening in the Union Outpost.

Cherokee-Indian Lloyd
Arneah, who hails from Cherokee,
NC, mesmerized his small audi-
ence with both his humor and his
stories.

The stories, which detailed
many of the beliefs, values, and
traditions of the Cherokee people,
were, as he was careful to point
out, not his own, but those of his
people. In a society which has so
little respect for the traditions of

the past, Arneah has managed to
keep the fading culture of the Na-

tive Americans alive in his gift for

storytelling — a gift that he gladly
shares with any who will listen.

Arneah began the evening with
two traditional tales; the first ex-
plaining why the deer loses his
antlers, and the second, how the
strawberry was created as a sym-
bol of man and woman’s love for
each other. His next two stories
concerned visions and vision
quests, and the powerful messages
that can be found hidden within
them.

Yet, amidst all of the rather
light hearted stories, Arneah inter-
jected an historical recounting of
the fate of the ghost dancers and
Lakota people at the Battle of
Wounded Knee (Dec. 29, 1890).

His master storytelling abilities
really shone through during this
particular account, for he recalled,
in a very moving way, the words of
one of the survivors of the massa-
cre, reflecting, “I did not know
then how much had ended there ...
something else died there ... a
people’s dream died ... a beautiful
dream.” by

The “death” of a culture is not
confined to necessarily violent
events, like the Battle of Wounded
Knee, as Arneah was determined
to point out. Rather, he insisted
that simple day to day neglect can
lead to the inevitable downfall of a
nation. Speaking with reference to
the Cherokee Reservation, which
is a sovereign nation within the
United States, Arneah explained
that one of the main problems in

Cherokee stems from an unwill-
ingness of the financially success-
ful or well-educated people to share
their talents with the community.
Nevertheless, progress is being
made, for just two years ago, the
first woman chief was elected,
Wilma Mankiller, and there are
hopes that soon, the tribal council
will create the Cherokee Nation’s
first constitution.

Ameah’s concluding story,
related the tale of one old man who
had just finished watching the
Kevin Costner film Dances With
Wolves, the old man’s eyes were
filled with tears, for the first time
in his entire life, those stories had
come alive for him.

And, indeed, after hearing
Lloyd Armeah speak, his stories
came alive for me.
