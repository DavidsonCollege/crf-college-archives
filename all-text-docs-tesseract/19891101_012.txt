NOT SEPARATE, from page 10

will not inhibit blacks from being full active partici-
pants in the social activities at Davidson. Indeed,

havinga black fraternity may increase participation. If.

we feel that we are fully represented on Davidson's
campus; academically, athletically, administratively
and socially, we might fully participate in the
Davidson ience.

While I’m at it: a) While the existing fraternity /
eating house system is in fact open for full participa-
tion by the entire Davidson College student body, in

fact the entire Davidson College student body does
not feel welcome to participate in it. Call it negative
atmosphere. You do get stared at even if it is done
subconsciously; b) Davidson College may be “fairly
representative of the society that Davidson students,
white and black, will enter after graduation,” but that
society itself is not equal, and modeling Davidson's
environment after that society only serves to under-
score and therefore perpetuate the inequality.

The fact that your boss, the owner of your busi-
ness, and your professors here or anywhere else are
not black is a direct result of bias that has been here for
400 years and will continue to be here unless institu-

tions of higher learning suchas Davidson that purport
toopen the minds of its constituents actively work to-
ward erasing that bias. Why aren’t your closest friends
black (besides the fact that there aren’t enough of us
here)? Accept and celebrate the differences.

Black Greeks, Black Student Coalition, black students,
faculty and staff. We are not here to segregate, but to
create anew understanding. Having us here does not
defer the dream, Mr. Moore. Having us here hastens
the coming of the dream. oi

_ Accept and celebrate the differences.
