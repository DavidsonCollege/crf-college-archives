THE EASY WAY OUT

I was going to write an article this week about intra-
mural athletics at Davidson. I was going to suggest that
perhaps the new LM.A.C. (Intermural Athletic Council)
could plan next year’s intramural schedule as much as
possible this year and in this way arrange the general
outline of next year’s program. Then I got a letter in the
mail. I think it should have gone to the head of the
I.M.A.C. but I opened it by mistake, so I thought I'd just
save a lot of trouble and print it.

A LETTER
Dear 1.M.A.C.,

I just heard where they elected a new group of
I.M.A.C. representatives the other day so I thought I'd
drop you all a little note with some advice. First I hope
you can keep up the good work of the council you are
about to replace.

Now I’ve never really liked intramurals, but when
{ came here four years ago the students used to really
take an interest in them. I’ve been happy to see that in
the last few years this interest has dropped off to prac-
tically nothing. Everyone knows that the reason we come
to college is to study and learn and yet I can remember
when four hundred people watched a flickerball game all
— (who knows how many q.p.’s were lost that

ay).

I'm glad this kind of nonsense has finally come to
an end, but I want to warn you to beware of a rebirth of
this wasteful enthusiasm. I know you new members of
the council have carefully observed the way this year’s
interfraternity program was run, but I'd like to point
out some specific examples of the ways in which you too
can discourage intramural sports.

The most important thing to remember in discourag-
ing intramurals is do not plan ahead. If no one knows
when an event will take place, how can they get excited
about it? Remember the track meet? The wrestling
match? The swimming meet? All of these events were
admirably handled in this fashion. Besides, if you don’t
plan ahead, it saves all the trouble of finding out when
the gym will be open or the track free in making up a
schedule.

Another important thing is to try to shroud the
whole workings of the I.M.A.C. from as many people as
possible. Since the only fraternity to know what the
overall intramural trophy looks like or how to win it is

Last week was the most successful stand the 'Cats have had this year, as they split with two very tough clubs.
The most impressive win was last Tuesday's shellacing of last year’s NAIA champions. Georgia Southern.

the Phi Delta Thetas, who cares? But don’t stop here—
any effort at obscuring I.M.A.C. procedure is usually an
effective method of ruining intramurals.

If the members of your council have as much imagin- |
ation as the past council, I’m sure they can come up|
with their own methods for ruining an intramural sport. |
But it never hurt anyone to learn a few old ways of doing |
something. Take basketball. }

Intramural basketball used to attract large crowds!
every night during the week, but through hard work this |
situation has been eliminated. Look how pitiful it was}
this year. It is a very simple to kill a big sport like|
that. Just remember—take the time of the year when
basketball starts and then delay the start of the season
for a month, then delay it for Thanksgiving, then delay
it for Christmas, then for exams, and then spread it out
over another month, and by the end of the season no one
will care if it ever ends.

If you keep it up next year, the season can be ex-
tended so that a further delay can be arranged for
spring recess.

Of course if you have enough courage, you can just
lose a sport. Handball, you know, is lost. Last time any-
body heard of it, the handball players were still playing,
but even they were uncertain as to where the ball had
gone. Now I know you can’t lose a sport like handball
often, but if you’re careful, you might hide the volleyball
while no one is looking this year.

I’m sorry that this little note got so long, but my
glee carried me away. I also know some of you are going
to come into this job as representative, gung-ho, but
what's the use? We know no one really likes intramurals,
that is, nobody but the jocks. Besides, it's a bad influence
on the intellectual atmosphere of our college.

So I think you can see it will be simpler and really
better to discourage rather than promote intramurals.
Therefore I extend the best wishes of all the members of
The Put Down the Jocks—For the College That Stays
Together, Prays (not plays) — Clubs in discourag-
ing intramurals at Davidson year. I know you can

do it.
Best Wishes,
A Friend
Perhaps A F is a little generous with his praise
of last 's I.M.A.C., but intramurals have declined both
in. and interest in the past years. The an-
swers for this decline may be, as many people suggest,

in the admissions department of the college. -

On the basis of ability and |
versatility, freshman Dick}
Snyder was chosen Fresh-|
man Athlete of the Year by|

_ the D Club April 19 at its}
‘ annual Spring Foolies.

Snyder follows Don Davidson
Ben Coxton, and Jim Hamilton
as recipient of this coveted a-
ward and was selected by a near
unanimous vote.

The 6'5" freshman from North
Canton, Ohio began his Davidson
athletic career by breaking a
three year old record for total
points on the physical proficien-
cy test by an impressive eighty-
five points. Snyder, on a full
scholarship, led the frosh bas-
ketball squad to a winning sea-
son and hopes to figure promin-
ently in next year’s varsity
plans. Presently he is playing a
dual role as a starting mounds
man for the baseball nine and
as a broad jumper for the track
team

Dick's personal ambition par
allels that of All-American hoop
ster Rod Thorn—a_ professional
baseball career, “if I'm good

| enough.” The recognition he re-

ceived in high school for his grid
feats overshadowed most of his
baseball and basketball accom-
plishments which resulted in
his receiving fewer scholarship
offers for the latter two sports.

Dick came to Davidson par-
tially as a result of the scholar-
ship offer. His primary desire
was to play basketball and he
knew of the academic quality of
the school. First contacted by
Coach Hunt and later, Coach
Driesell, Dick made a visit to
the campus, was impressed with
what he saw and who he met,
and inked his present scholar

ship agreement.

Since coming to school, he
has chosen business for his field
of study and would like to at-
tend graduate school for a year.
This summer he will work either
on a state road crew or for a
eonstruction company. The re-
mainder of his time will be
spent practicing basketball,
playing on a city baseball team,
and—he says with a half apolo-
getic, half anxious smile—dat-

ing.

But a larger share of the blame for
must be assumed by the I1.M.A.C.’s that were in charge
for the past few Foc I hope that the new LM.A.C. will
plan ahead, provide information, and try to organize the
various in such a manner that the
students and the members of the I.M.A.C. will enjoy play-
ing in them.
