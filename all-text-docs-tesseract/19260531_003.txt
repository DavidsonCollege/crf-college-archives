Ninety-Two Men of ’26 to Receive
- Diplomas Wednesday

The 92 men who will receive degrees from
Davidson ‘Gdllege on June 2 represents the
largest class that has ever graduated from
Davidson, and the yumber finishing this year
is quite a contrast ‘to that of only a few
years ago. :

Following a slump after the war there
were but 28 men finishing in 1919, but since
that date there has been a gradual increase
until the class of 1926 is almost three times
the size of six years ago.

In 1920, 40 students won their diplomas,
53 were awarded sheepskins in 1921, 79 this
coveted honor in 1922, while the following
year -d a slight decrease when only
77 men were granted degrees. This was in-
creased in 1924 to 81 men, while last year
four additional ones were aded, giving the

shor

class a total of 85 graduates. This year's
number will accordingly exceed that by seven
students, though three of these will be grant-
ed diplomas for work which was completed
last summer or in the fall term.
