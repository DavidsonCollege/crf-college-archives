ne of the greatest tragedies
in music is the
misperception of blues.
Whether. due to stereotypes or a
misleading name, for many “blues”
means either
scratchy acous-
tic guitar or a
band playing

of Power, Robert Cray andthe Mem-
phis Horns, and the King himself. J.
and Dick were first at bat which
leads me to my first complaint. J.
was probably second in fame to
King at the
concert, and
yet he and
. Dick go first

slow, sad mu-

sic through the

smoky haze of

a bar. But while ears may be cupped
at the mention of the word, feet
stomp and heels kick at the playing
of it. Everyone loves the music or
they just don’t know its name.

Yet despite an art form lacking
appreciation and understanding, one
name continues to shine with rec-
ognition and affection: B.B. King.
Aside from playing a major role in
the development of the music,
King’s greatest contribution to the
blues is his deliverance of it to the
mainstream. Audiences, spellbound
by his passionate music and lovable
character, leave his concerts know-
ing not just his name, but a little
more about the blues.

Last Thursday in the UNNC
student activities center, King cap-
tivated another crowd with his magi-
cal charm and spirited playing.
Now, although King was the head-
line for “The Thrill is Back” blues
festival, this might have been hard
to determine as the accompanying
bands were of comparable notori-
ety: J. Geils and Magic Dick, Tower

out of a four
band line-
up. Not only
were they the opening band, but
after a half-hour they were packing
up. Ofcourse, the reason I’m whin-
ing and moaning about this is be-
cause | arrived late and only caught

their finale—’Whammer Jammer,” °

which was upto par. Buta half-hour
on stage is not an act, It’s a tease.
As luck would have it I arrived
right when the good band was step-
ping down and the bad one was

tuning up. For some reason I had,

the impression that Tower of Power
was a jazz band, and a good one at
that. But what they played was no
where near jazz (note that this was
billed as a BLUES festival). Com-
bine cheesy, sappy jazz reminiscent
of Kenny G along with soft rock
and you’ ll approach what this group
was playing. The band consisted of
a five piece horn section, bass, gui-
tarist, and drummer, all nothing to
write home about. Then came the
maraschino cherry on top of this
pile of leftovers: A party singer who
walked back and forth on the edge
of the stage dancing and flailing his

arms as if possessed. On some
songs he’d do the put-your-arms-
in-the-air thing or shout-and-re-
sponse with the audience. To make
matters worse, the acoustics of the
performance hall which was a large
sports stadium were the worst pos-
sible. After the reverberation dealt
with what came out of the speakers,
the music turned into noise, with all
the instruments meshed into one,
indistinguishable blur of sound.

This had to. be endured for an
hour (why couldn’t Tower play the
half-hour and give J the full?) be-
fore relief came from Robert Cray.
His soulful playing left no doubt as
to why he is among the most popu-
lar contemporary blues guitarists.
A standing ovation and an encore
later, the stage was primed for the
main event.

Before King could play a note,
the audience was on their feet, the
position they spent a good part of
the show in, as standing ovations
were prolific until the end. And
they were well deserved, for KIng
was at his usual best. But he wasn’t
the only star on the stage. Backing
him was a solid band complete with
a stellar brass section and double
drum set. The back-up guitarist

was so exceptional I wondered if he

was creeping upstage of King ...
naaa. King’s unique, patented style
is untouchable, and Lucille (his gui-
tar) sang it beautifully as always.
But King’s playing wasn’t his only
performance. His warm, jestful,

@ B.B. King jams away.

fatherly stage presence was a show
unto itself.

After the first few songs, King
sat down with Lucille and had a
little one-on-one chat with the audi-
ence, telling stories, making jokes,
playing music, and just being his
merry old self. The audience loved
him, and King graciously recipro-
cated it.

I walked away from the show
riding on air. King’s music and
character elevated every spirit in
the house, no matter how many

papers, reviews, or problem sets
were due. I couldn’t believe I was

ambivalent about going, pondering
the time tested Davidson excuse
listed above.

Afterwards, I couldn’t imag-
ine how Inot could have gone. King
made it all worthwhile, every dollar
of the $25 for admission and every ~
minute of the five hour show.

Afterall, who knows if’ llever
see him again— he’s 72 years old!
and still going strong, hopefully for
many more years to come.

Disco Night makes modest 900 Room debut

By WESLEY GOLDSBERRY
Arts and Living Editor

Traversing Chambers Lawn
from north to south shortly after
10:00 p.m. last Thursday night, a
flourish of activity caught my eye
_as I peered upwards through those
majestic “rectangle capped with

semicircle” 900 Room windows. _

Vibrant ‘lights, brisk music, a
humble flailing of several limbs;
something was definitely going
down. This “something” was the
year’s first Disco Night, which is
scheduled to occur every other
Thursday night at 10:00 p.m.
While the upside is that Disco
Night will be a biweekly event, the
downside is that fifteen minutes
into Thursday night’s installment,
there were about 10 whole people
in attendance. Fortunately, they

The atmosphere was disco, but

the music wavered anywhere in
between disco and the Indigo Girls
(a mistake which was quickly rem-
edied). Nonetheless, it was nearly
all danceable. Further credit is due
to the DJ for not playing “YMCA,”
although “In the Navy” would be a
worthy substitute for subsequent
occasions.

Even if one had no intention of
dancing, entry is free as are the huge

quantities of bright or-
ange tortilla chips and
salsa, which are worth
the trip up the Union
staircase. Complimen-
tary water is available
at the bar.

Disco Night’s pace
did rev up significantly
after thirty minutes,
with as many.as 60 stu-
dents on the floor at a
time, which is still a
mere 4 per cent of the
student body. Many
first-year students ar-
rived in some what au-
thentic 70s garb, with
a smattering of upper-
classmen similarly
dressed. Making up
for the shortage of stu-
dents in attendance,
those that were there were engulfed
in enthusiasm. Music continued to
play for a solid few until at least 10
minutes after the scheduled ending
time of 11:30 p.m.

Disco Night is a great idea, and,
with a packed dance floor, could
become even more hip and success-
ful.

If you enjoy starting your . 3

weekend early, you should go.
