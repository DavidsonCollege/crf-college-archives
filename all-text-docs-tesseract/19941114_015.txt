Women’s basketball Southern Conference nteview

By Matt Pitzer

Georgia will likely be the
home of the conference champion-
ship for a third straight year.

Returning four starters and ten
players from last year’s team, Geor-
gia Southern is a strong candidate
to winits third consecutive tourna-
menttitle and represent the confer-
ence in the NCAA tournament
again.

The Eagles were the unani-
mous choice in the coaches’ pre-
season poll. The Eagles have two
second-team all-conference play-
ers returning from last season:
forward Andrea Autrey (15.4 ppg,
7.7 rpg) and guard Janice Johnson
(13.7 ppg, 4.6 rpg).

Both were named to the pre-
season all-conference team by the
coaches.

East Tennessee State should
wrap up second place, while
Furman will take third, followed

by Appalachian State, Marshall, :
Tennessee-Chattanooga, Davidson
and Western Carolina.

Aside from Autrey and
Johnson, Georgia Southern coach
Drema Greer will also have senior
guard Stacy Childers and junior
center Marysue James. Childers
was the team’s top three-point
shooter last year with 1.5 three-
pointers per game on 34.6 percent
shooting.

East Tennessee State will be
led by DeShawne Blocker, a three-
time first-team all-conference se-
lection and the 1992-93 Confer-
ence player of the year. The 6-0
forward returns for her last season
after leading the nation in rebound-
ing last year with 17.0 per game.
She was also second in the league
in field-goal percentage at 61.2%
and third in scoring with 19.7
points-per-game.

Completing the best frontline

in the league are senior center
Justina McClelan (12.8 ppg, 8.0
rpg) and senior forward Yvette
Grainger (10.4 ppg, 6.6 rpg). Nikki
Kile is the fourth returning starter
for the Buccaneers. Amy Engle, a
junior forward transfer from Ten-
nessee Tech, is the top newcomer.
If ETSU wants to challenge Geor-
gia Southern for the title, it will
have take care of the ball as they
turned it over 28 times a game last
year.

Furman played Georgia
Southern tough in the tournament
final and have three starters return-
ing from that team. First-team all-
conference selection Karen Stanly
(15.9 ppg and top-five in the con-
ference in five other categories)
returns at guard as does Kristi
Creamer. The senior forward aver-
aged 10.0 points and 6.7 rebounds
last year.

The biggest loss for the Pala-

Team continued from page 13

season. “The pleasant surprise of
last year. From January on she
gave us an inside force to help us
compete in the conference,” said
Filar.

Vanessa Sims 5-10 Jr.: Sims is
oné of the most athletic players on
the team and should see more play-
ing time this season. Herhard work
following the season’s end last
spring has really impressed the
coaching staff. “She is the most
improved practice player from last
season,” said Filar.

Amy Scalcucci 5-10  So.:
Scalcucci saw action in all of the
Wildcat’s games last season, start-

Women’s hoops

ing nine games as a freshman

is a great hustler and good shot
blocker along with surprising
range, making 26 three pointers
last season. Scalcucci will play
small forward this season and
should see considerable playing
time every time the Wildcats hit
the floor. “She recovered strong
toward the end of the season. Her
shot is much quicker and she has
improved her court vision over the
summer, “ said Filar.

Jamie Vanlerberghe 6-2 Fr.:
The tallest player on the team
should make an immediate impact
when she recovers from her knee
injury. She has a good jump shot
and can create several different
shot opportunities. She will re-

sume practicing with the tea on
December 15 and will be in play-
ing form for the conference cot
in fotki

Danielle Mall 5-11 Fr.: Mall is
a very strong physical force and a
good overall athlete. She is one of
the most physical players on the
team and was a late find in the
recruiting wars last year.

Jennifer Sanborn 5-8 Fr.: Filar
describes heras the “streak shooter
of the team.” Sanborn gives the
Wildcats yet another threat from
outside and will see a lot of playing
time over the season. As her de-
fensive skills increase, so will her
minutes on the court.

dins is Rushia Brown, a four-time
all-conference selection. Starting
point guard Jennifer Jones is also
gone, but some of the 11 returning
players will be able to pick up the
slack.

Appalachian State took sec-
ond in the regular season but lost to
Furman in the semifinals. The
Mountaineers will have to fill last
year’s player of the year, Angela
Crosby, lost to graduation. Coach
Linda Robinson hopes junior
guards Shannon Spencer (3.0 steals
and 5.0 assists per game) and Beth
Kilby and junior forward Karolina
Karqvist (5.6 rpg) will pick up the
load this season.

Marshall has a very young
team this year, returning just two
starters from last year’s team. Se-
nior forward Tamira Higgins (14.0
points and 5.1 rebounds per game)
and senior center Jodi Baker (11.0
and 8.0 rebounds) will be a strong
Start, though. Eight of the Herd’s
14 players are freshmen or sopho-

mores. But four of the team’s top
six scorers, including sophomore
guards Kristi Sexton and Stephanie
Wise. Coach Sara Evans-Moore
also has one of her strongest re-
cruiting classes ever.

Tennessee-Chattanooga lost
three starters (all double-digit scor-
ers) from last year’s squad and
must find players to step into the
void. Senior forward Anit Over-
cast and sophomore forward Am-
ber Test are among the four play-
ers returning from last year’s team.
But the Moccasins add four junior
college players and redshirt fresh-
men Rebecca Rogers and Spring
Thompson.

Three starters return from
Western Carolina’s 7th place team
last year, including freshman of
the year Pam Owens, who aver-
aged 9.4 points per game last year. :
Coach Gary Peters added six new-
comers, including transfer Makisha
Gary, a junior forward who will
have to contribute immediately.
