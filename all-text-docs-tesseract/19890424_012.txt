Morris, players react to

recent basketball decisions

By JOHN BURNS
and JAY CHAUDHURI

Reactions to the news of Bruce Elder’s
probable departure were mixed this week.

Two players and Athletic Director Chris-
topher B. “Kit”
Morris talked to
The Davidsonian.

Davidson’s
freshman big man
Paul Drobnitch
said that he “was
disappointed”
when he first
heard of Elder’s
likely transfer.

“He and I had
become pretty
good friends,”
said Drobnitch. “I
think most of the
players on the
team would say
that they were disappointed to see him
go...he got along well with the rest of the
team.”

Paul Drobnitch, #35.

Drobnitch said that he sensed no resent- .

ment on the team. ““We wish him well,” he
affirmed.
Drobnitch also
pointed out that al-
though Elder led
the team in scoring
“we still have a lot
of talent, without
him we’re not lost,
we’re not going to
be pitiful.”
Surprisingly, we

were able to reach
Morris on a nice,
sunny day like
Wednesday.

“We have left this
up to Bruce,” he
commented. “It’s
the same kind of
thing about anyone making this kind of de-

type of decision, and out of necessity, a
selfish one.” Morris went on to state that
Elder’s best self interest is the most im-
portant factor.

“Obviously, we would hope that that
would be to stay at
Davidson,” he
added.

Junior Mau-
rice Gray was quiet
and reserved but
commented, “I think
that his decision to
leave was one of his
choice...how it will
effect the team, that
remains to be seen. I
don’t think we’ll
have any problems,
we have a lot of tal-
ent.”

Magic Gaines
refused to comment.

According to Morris, the search com-
mittee had made some progress on find-
ing a new coach, but he declined to give
any names. He claimed that it is “in our
best interest” to
name a new coach
by the end of the
school year. He also
anticipates “many
more long nights at
the office before this
thing is over.”

Gray gave no
specifics on his idea
of a good coach.

“T just want to
play basketball,” he
said.

One thing is
for sure: in this, the
final issue of the 88-
89Davidsonian we
can safely predict that there are few sports

Don’t wind-up a lobster

gargoyle

"By MARK PUCKETT
Scene: E.H. Little Library, 1st Floor

A large, white textbook sat in her lap.
She underlined it diligently with a pink
highlighter. Her face looked different, in-
human. I moved nearer with interest. At her
carrel, she looked at me and smiled. The
whiteness of her teeth contrasted warmly
with the fiery, unnatural redness of the
face. She resembled a lobster gargoyle. I
stared rudely.

““What happened to you?” I asked. “What
happened to your face?”

“T sunbathed today at the lake,” she re-
plied.

“For how long?”

“Well, we left around 1:00 and stayed
until 3:00 or so. I guess we were in the sun
for a couple of hours. But since I’m not
gonna get the chance to sit out anymore this
week, I squeezed as much as I could into
today.” .

“T thought that you were supposed to tan
gradually..:.”

“If you use baby oil, you can tan pretty

quickly,” she retorted.

“Why don’t you use sunscreen?” I asked.

“I’m not a kid anymore.”

“Don’t you know when you tan between

12 and 3 o’clock in the afternoon--doused
in baby oil--you are inviting the most in-
tense ultraviolet rays of the day?”
* The girl leered at me. If she was embaras-
sed, I couldn’t tell. Her face had been
consistently red throughout the conversa-
tion. “Leave me alone,” she said. “I have to
study.”

She buried her nose back into her farge,
white textbook.

I left the library after gathering my
books. While I walked outside, I thought of
her getting skin cancer. And dying. I don’t
suppose she cared, though. She believed
that the sun gods had embellished not only
her meager looks with their gift of light, but
her personality as well.

At age 30, however, her skin would suf-
fer. “Right now,” I said to myself, “she
must concentrate on her new sunburn, for
eventually it will evolve into. a temporary
tan.”

GOLF, from page 10

77 on arather windy day. The 313 score by
Davidson is one of the lowest point totals
for the golf team in the past years and is in-
dicative of the potential for the golf team’s
improvement.

Weather on the third day was beautiful,
and this would be the only tournament the
Cats would play under good conditions.
Grainger followed his first two rounds of
78 and 79 with a solid 75 earning himself a
top 20 finish individually. He completed
the round with ten straight pars after a
string of three bogies. The fine team score,
a three day total averaging under 80 shots
per round, put the Cats eighth out of 15

cision. This is a very personal, very private

controversies remaining for next year.

of competition, it was an
excellent finish.

The final tour-
nament was at Campbell
University. The team
was hurt by the absence

_of Fiore, heonard, Mag-
gart and Prince although
Sean O’Neill, Curtis Ott
and Ed Powell coura-
geously substituted.
Carlock, in his last tour-
nament for Davidson,
shot 79-78-84, a solid
performance typical of

teams. Given the quality —

his four good years in the starting lineup.
Grainger, also, played well, shooting 79-
74-75 and finishing 13th in the tournament.

Despite the sour finish, the golf team
hacked well this spring. They were com-
petitive against Navy, Appalachian “State
and USC-Spartanburg. At the Richmond
tournament Grainger beat the entire Duke
team in the first round.

The losses of seniors Carlock and Prince
will hurt the Cats next year. Carlock gave
Davidson four good years of gold, serving
as captain for a year and playing number
one man often. Prince grew as a golfer at
Davidson, developing an uncanny “pipe-
line” accuracy to improve his game.

Returning for Davidson, however are
four players -- Grainger, Fiore, Leonard
and Maggart. Grainger had his best year at
Davidson, averaging about 76 and not
shooting over 80 in any of his last 10

Tounds. Fiore, Leonard and Maggart also

played well this spring.

The golf team has gradually become
competitive. Newly-appointed coach
Slagle has helped foster the players’ poten-
tial by intensifying practices and a positive
golfing infrastructure is being established
with the support of Tom Rogers, golf pro at
the Charlotte Country Club. If the team
stays dedicated, continues on its current
path, and is given increased support of the -
athletic department, it should become a
strong intercollegiate team.
