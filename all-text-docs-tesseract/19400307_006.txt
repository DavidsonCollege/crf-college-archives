Last Thursday evening Da-

ers Park 4-5 Gray-Y Charter
Service in Charlotte. This club,
which is sponsored by the Y. M.
C. A. was organized to aid the
youth of Charlotte. It is to culti-
vate healthy standards of living
in the community.

The charter service consisted
mainly of an exhibition of the

handicraft and talents of the
youthful members.
This organization, which is

national in scope, is a very great
asset in coping with child delin-
quency. This was the
charter service of Gra-Y Clubs
in Charlotte. The first was held
by the Eastover Sixth Gra-Y
Club, February 1.

After the charter service, re-
freshments were served and a
tour of inspection was conducted
through the Charlotte YMCA.

This work is supervised by the
Davidson YMCA. Bill Bolin and
Jim Owens are in charge of the
project.
