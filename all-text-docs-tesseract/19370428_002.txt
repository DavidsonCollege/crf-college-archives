QUEENS VISITS ... \s The Davidsonian
went to press. there was no direct indication

as tv the suecess of Queens Davidson Day, but sports, attd many more could be developed if

everything sccmed to point in that direction.

The idea is decidedly new to Davidson, and
for that reason we heartily eommend it. Any -
thing new at Davidson is a goéd thing, with-
in certain bonds.

NH would seem that the student body as a
whole should enter into the project whole-
heartedly ‘as Tyler Port and joe Huaer
stressed in chapel. lLlowever, preceding the
arrival of the Queens girls, there was a good
dea) of dissension and tigriping” about the
blind date idea. This shows a decidedly poor
spirit among Davidson students, for after all.
this business is not a lite and death matter.
Livery Queens girl probably felt the same ap-
prehension.

Our hats off to the hard working commitcce
in charge. The handling of activities for

some three hundred gitls and their dates is ,

no small task and we do not envy those com-

mitteemen in the Teast.

CAMPUS CARE... Mr. Hobart and his effi.
cient grounds workecs have carried Gul an
execilent picee of work, in putting the cam-
pus in tiptop shape before the alumni return
for the Centennial. Tree surgeons have been
hard at work. removing dead trees and prun-
ing diseased ones, Grass has also bean planted
in those bare places seattered here and there

over the campus.

PAGEANT DIFFICULTIES ... The College

undertook a project oz ao mean proportions.

when it plunged into the putting oa ofa pag-

eant. This fact has been thoroughly empha-

sized, and the forthcoming preducion has

been given a great deal of advance publicity
- by The Davidsonian.

However, mistakes that have been made in
other pageants of a similar nature have been
called to our mind continually by fellow stu-
dents with a feeling of apprehension as to the
success of the undertaking.

Probably the greatest danger in the pro-
duction of a pageant is that it will be too long
and drawn out, Aecording to Mr. Viehman,
nothing like this will happen, ‘Insufficient or
poorly directed tighting thas carried many a
pageant to failure. while bad amplification has
ruined others. In some instances whole sec-
tions of such systems have gone dead. In
other cases, the broadcast sounds have been
out of phase. In other words, the technical
facilities must be perfect.

Other undertakings of such a nature have
also been criticized for the congestion back
Stage, but if proper preparation is made and
more than one stage is used, as is to be the
case here, this difficulty will be eliminated.

However, we believe that Mr. Viehman and
his faculty and student aids will handle the
work efficiently. These above ideas are mere-
ly suggestions from various members of the
student body and faculty.

STAFF ELECTIONS ... Would you like to
choose the captain of the foozball team by
popular eleetion? or any other team for that
matter? Yer the student body as a whole has
ample opportunity to watch athteue teams
periorm, . While on our publication
where skill and ability count most, the student
body has seam oecasion to see or judge abili-
ties of the candidates for editorship. Watch

CHEMISTRY LAB ... Time and tame again.

the needs oj the campus have been stressed
before faeuity. saudents, alumni. and friends
in dhe hope that some donation migh? be ob-
tamed for the erection of much - needed
buldings.

. \mong those buildings needed has teen
mentioned a new and modern chemistry Iab-
oratory, but we do not believe this need has
been sutheiently expressed: The present lab-
oratory with its crowded conditions. its acid-
aaten benehes, its insuttieient equipment, and
poor faeitities is. not enough to imbne any
budding chemist with the desire to parsue
chemistry as a protession. Flere hes an op-
portanity for some enterprising alumnus or

‘to? want to suppor his class or traternity in

iriend whose interests lie in the field «of
chemistry.

When the tinal curtain was pulled down on
a rather successiul season of coliegiate com-
petition in the winter sports, our eves were
-niturally turned toward the spring sports.
Our teams started oft in a breeae, overwhelm-
ing some poweriul foes, but in the first home
games they met some stitt competition cou-
pled with a streak of bad luck and were
thrown on the losing end, ae~ .

Now we.vhave some very fine athletes on
the teams which are representing us in spring

we wonld iust do our part to give them con-
tidence. Rut if we are going to allow outside
visitors to oulnumber the student supporters
in_the stadium how ean WE help our own
classmates in winning their games? And
iurthermore what impression are we qmiving
the publie of that “Wildeat Spin”? which has
earried Davidson teams so far in the past?

it is a known fact that al! of us cannot
be present at every game in which our teams
play because of conilicts in other sports,
classes, etc.. but it is quite clear that we could
have a much better representation than we
have had in the past. {i seems that there
have been more at the tatra mural games Chan
at the inter-collegiate games oftentimes, and
of course it is perfetily natural for a student

that field. but which means the most to the
development of Davidson and_the future of
the “Wiideac Spirit?” Woulda's it be possible
to postpone these intra mural activities to
days when our teams were not playing here
on the campus and thereby allow all of us to
offer our support wher OUR teams do play
here and expeet that support?

Gentlemen, if OUK teatns ever needed any
support, they need itinow. Put yourselves in
their shoes, How do you think you would
“eel to be playing an important game to an
empty stadiutn? They represent us. so let's do
our partl Ji our team gets a little behind,
don't get up and walk out with that dissap-
pointed look on your face, After all, winning
the game is just secondary and “playing” the
‘wame is essential to the true Davidson man,
and that is where all of us can do our part!

A new way to kill time has been invented
hy students at Northern Llinois State Teach-
ers’ Gollege. They draw a circle representing
a clock and hands. At five minute intervals
they ink out the sections around the dial. At
the end of the hour it is completely filled.

“Pun Revival Week” was originated a short
time ago by Dr. William Patterson, professor
of mathematics., The reviving of. old puns
will sharpen the wit and lend credence to the
blur which represents the calculus in most
sophomore minds, he explained.

And this set promises to be the
best, all-round thinees ~ever-enjoyed
at. Davidsone We Centennials
think this year has been the ne
plus ultra in Davidson's one hun-
dred years of progress.

For a century Davidson has pos-
sessed a nationally-known and un-
ique reputation for educational and
spiritual qualities. And during the
past several years it has been be-
coming more and more interested in
promoting a clean, wholesome, and
essential social life for its students.
Dancing, controversial subject. is
a delightiul and entertaining phase
of social activity and Davidson
dances are kept on a high plane and
of fine quality because of the Dav-
idson gentlemen who sponsor and
attend them. Let’s keep them that
way !

There will be two tea dances this
time and ghere is a special request
to support the Friday afternoon
dance so it will be continued in the
future. Whether you are a Goop
or a Smoothie Tet’s get the drag
of your choice lined up. whip ever’

| OPEN FORUM

GREEK AND BARBARIAN

“Davidson is famed for its

democratic spirit.” But there is ‘one |}

division among the students here

that ofe is not supposed to discuss. |.

That,is the division between Greek
and non-Greek. Except for Y. M.
Cc. A. or Ministerial Band news, the
whole Davidsoninn might be en-
tiled “Among the Greeks.”

Nothing is ever said about this
distinction because the fraternity
man isn't conscious of it, and the
non-fraternity man issafraid of be-
ing called “sour grapes” or some-
thing clse along that line if He says
anything about fraternity men be-
ing undemocratic.

This is a news item: There are
a few men of some worth among
the non-fraternity group. Now this
fact is not recognized by all fra-
ternity men. One told me in so
many words that there weren't any
non-fraternity men that were any
good—not at, least for. the job for
which he was nominating a frater-
nity brother (no, T didn’t. challenge
him toa duel. He didn't know any
better).

One reason why .the fraternity
men are outstanding at Davidson
is because they receive the back-
ing and cncouragement of their fra-
ternity brothers in getting into ac-
tivities. This is an inestimable ad-
vantage. But why doesn’t some-
body try giving a few non-frater-
nity men such a deal? But when
somcone recently suggested an or-
ganization to help non-fraternity
men get into things everybody lift-
ed up their hands in horror. “Pol-
ities f"

No, we don't believe in Politics
at Davidson. We just don’t give
the barbarians any but a nominal

part in student life because — well,
because they're barbarians, that’s
why I—R.A.T.
