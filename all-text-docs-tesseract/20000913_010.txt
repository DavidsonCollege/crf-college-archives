As head coach Jen Halliday led 21 Wild-
cats aboard a US Airways Boeing 737 two
weekends ago, their lift-off ushered in a whole
new era for the Davidson field hockey pro-
gram.

The Wildcats trek to St. Louis for their
inaugural game as a member of the NorPac
(Northern Pacific Field Hockey Conference)
ended twenty-five years of islandic status as
one of the three Division I field hockey squads
without an affiliation.

The NorPac—an ill-titled seven-squad con-
ference that actually includes teams ranging
from the San Francisco Bay Area all the way
across the Appalachians—offers a wide ar-
ray of benefits to Davidson’s program: a
chance to earn a bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment, post-season award recognitions such
as all-conference designations, and a nation-
wide recruiting pool.

“Tt gives us an identity, a family, anda huge
recruiting tool,” Halliday said.

“Post-season play is the end-all be-all, but
there are so many other benefits.”

Athletic Director Jim Murphy lauded the
move, “The ability for the team—and the
school—to affiliate with a nationwide collec-
tion of schools is something that’s very posi-
tive for our program.”

The Wildcats are expected to fare rather
well against the improved competition—
Davidson split its first pair of conference
games, knocking off St. Louis but falling to

Stanford. Last season, Davidson won three.

out of four games against schools in the
NorPac, including a win over the highly-
touted Cardinal.

“I think we’re going to be really competi-:

tive in the conference,” asserted senior co-
captain Ashley Hart. “Stanford is one of the
best teams in the confer-
ence, and we’ ve matched
up really well against
them.”

Personnel

Davidson enters the
fall season with a dy-
namic array of young tal-
ent to complement a rich
stock of senior leader-
ship.

“It’s really incredible,”
Hart remarked. “Every
position is filled with
outstanding athletes. We
definitely lost some great
players [to graduation],
but we have some people who can step up and
do the job.”

Hart and Jennie Gold, both mid-fielders,
will captain the squad that includes a power-
ful class of five seniors rounded out by Lea
Jaeger, Karen Lamoreaux, and Lauren
Hancock.

“The senior class is great,” said Hart. “Each
senior is going to be contributing so much
this year.”

Another key to this year’s success lies with

the sophomores, a class that will yield four
starters including a talented tandem of fast-
footed forwards in Alex Rogers and Agnes
Bateman.

Rogers and. Bateman tallied six goals a
piece last season, third-most on the team.
Another sophomore, Jessica Barton, returns
after starting in all 18
games last season and

her own.

“(The sophomores]
have really changed the
dynamics of the team,”
noted. Hart. “They’ve
added a lot of spunk.”

And Halliday picked up
five freshmen this season;
one of whom, Christina
Auer, has already earned
the starting nod at right
back.

The Blizzard

Hands down, the cor-
nerstone and heart of this squad is its young
head coach, Jennifer Blizzard Halliday.

A 1993 graduate of the University of North
Carolina, Halliday brings an infectious te-
nacity and an inspiring record of on-the-field
accomplishment to the program. During her
four year career, the Tarheels went 86-22-5,
won three ACC championships, and played
in four NCAA national championship games.

The daughter of a highly-decorated Marine
general, Halliday exhibits fiery determina-

- Wepwespay, Sepremiier13,2000

Field Hockey grows under Halliday,

racking up five goals of,

tion, profound and disciplined humility, and
a tremendous work ethic.

“Coach is full of energy,” commented
Hancock. “It’s evident to all of us just how
much she loves this program.”

And, according to her players, the “love”
goes far beyond an institutional commitment.
Halliday, they say, invests a deep personal
commitment into each and every athlete that
she welcomes to Davidson.

“She works us hard,” Hancock admitted.
“But we can tell that it’s because she cares
about us so much personally. And she’s
really good about respecting our academics
and our off-the-field lives.”

Hart added, “She’s really determined to
take us to the next level.”

And the NorPac move is a momentous step
in that direction.

“T’ve worked hard on the conference issue
from day one,” professed Halliday, who
pledged to pursue a conference affiliation
during her job interview four years ago.

Just four years later, Halliday has revived
what was a floundering program, linked
Davidson to a conference with such national
academic and athletic powerhouses as
Stanford University, and all in all put Davidson
field hockey on the national map.

But as Davidson enters a brave new world
of conference action and high-powered field
hockey, they find themselves at just the be-
ginning of the long road toward success.

Hoyas slip by ‘Cats

Opportunity knocked—to the tune of 31
shots on goal—on Saturday, but the Wildcats
were unable to answer as Georgetown es-
caped with a 2-1 victory.

“We had the opportunities,” acknowledged
senior co-captain Jennie Gold. “But we’re
just miss-
ing that fi-
nal push to

in.”

Davidson
controlled
play for
most of the day—outshooting the Hoyas 19-
2 in the second half and 31-13 overall—but
their lone goal came off a Gold penalty-
stroke with 8:28 to go in the game.

Meanwhile, Caitlin McLean and Leeanne .

Rizzo punched in goals for the Hoyas. But the
big story for Georgetown on Saturday was
the play of sophomore goalkeeper Jessica
Herring.

- Herring faced 31 shots on goal, including
11 corners and three penalty strokes, and
came away with 13 saves and the victory.

“She was as aggressive a goalieasI’ ve ever
seen,” lauded Davidson head coach Jen
Halliday. “She was phenomenal.”

Georgetown coach Laurie Carroll wasn’t

’ surprised. “That’s:-what we expect from (Her-
ring). Those are the kind of performances that
Jess has all the time.”

The Wildcats had some strong perfor-
mances of their own—Coach Halliday praised
sophomore: Allison Matlack for a breakout
performance.

With the loss, Davidson suffered its fourth
defeat in a row, skidding to a 1-4 start in their
foundational season as a NorPac affiliate.

But, according to Coach Halliday, all is far
from lost. “We’ve [dominated the game but
been outscored] three times so far,” said
Halliday, whose squad holds a 1-1 record in
NorPac play so far. “We just need to start
putting it in the goal.”

Georgetown’s head coach spoke highly of
the Wildcat squad. “The word is that Davidson
is fast and they’re feisty and they’re skilled
and they’re well-coached,” Carroll said.
“People are excited to play Davidson because
they know they’re going to compete every
time they step on the field.”
