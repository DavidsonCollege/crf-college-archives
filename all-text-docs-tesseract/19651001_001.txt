Counselors Receive
Increase In Salary

The 22 freshman hall coun-
selors received a $20-per-semes-
ter increase in remuneration
from the college this week.

The hall counselors, who had
previously received one-half of
their room rent as payment for
their position, were awarded the
increase in payment after pre-
senting a petition to Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts Jr.
two weeks ago.

The petition was presented to
Dean Burts on Sept. 16. The
hall counselors contended that
greater responsibilities due to
the change in social structure
on campus had increased their
duties this year.

With delayed rush this year
the hall counselors .have taken
over many of the responsibili-
ties which previously Were han-
dled by fraternities or by fra-
ternity members.

The counselors—14 juniors and
8 seniors — cited orientation,
freshman intramural athletics,
social life, and scholarship as
the main areas in which their
influence and responsibility is
greatly increased.

They also pointed to the situa-
tions at other schools, in which
the salaries are generally high-

Harry S. Hill, cafeteria

manager, pointed this weck-

to a marked decrease in
complaints as an indication
of improvements in quality
and service of food at the
College Union.

“Complaints,” he remarked,
“have decreased considerably
since last Thursday.” .

Hill said he has remedied
threats to sanitary conditions,
increased the variety of food,
tried to improve efficiency in
serving lines, and made other
changes in response te many
complaints from students dur-
ing the first weeks of school.

EXTERMINATOR

He said that an exterminator

came on Sept. 22 to relieve the

The naif counselors have in-
dicated that they will present
their evaluations and recommen-
dations to Dean Burts at the

beginning of the election of hall
counselors and the planning of
the program for the next year.

In hts letter to the coun-
selors, Dean Burts confirmed
the feeling that they are “con-
tributing in a unique and effec-

tive way to the lives of the

hall counselors.

Dirty Rush Charge
Prompts Alteration

Freshman contact with fraternity men in any dorm
on campus was prohibited by the Interfraternity Council
as part of several changes in the rush regulations ap-

proved Monday night.

IFC President Jim Terry
explained that the new rule
restricts fraternity men
from entering freshmen
dorms at any time through
Jan. 3 and prohibits fresh-
men from entering upper-
class dorms during the same
period.

When Terry announced
Wednesday in freshman chapel
the adoption of the new rule,
many questions and heated opin-
ions immediately arose. Johnny
Jeter, chairman of the IFC
Rush Committee, explained that

such a provision would help

eliminate “‘dirty rush."

However, most freshmen still
asked “Why?". Craig Wilson
pointed out. ‘Since freshmen
are cut off from meeting fra-
ternity men, most of us are
more vulnerable to the Inde-
pendent point of view.’

Dave Powell, freshman ad-
visor, told the assembly that
all complaints or proposals
should be orderly processed
through the Freshman Council.

“DIRTY RUSH”

This controversial ruling—
much more restrictive than the
earlier “7:30 p.m. provision’—
was partially prompted after
charges of “‘dirty rush" were
brought against one fraternity.

qin
But because of insufficient
evidence and the lack of clar-
ity in the old provisions, the
penalty was commuted to an
“official IFC warning.’’ Imme-
diately following this, the IFC
members began to revise the old
rules in order ‘‘to prevent loop-
holes and. to facilitate their en-
forcement.”
HOUSING FOR HOMECOMING

Next the related problem of
dormitory housing during Home-
coming was decided. All fresh-
men in Cannon will move into
East; all residents of Belk and
Richardson may move into Can-

Carroll Leads Voting

For Court

Don Carroll: again led voting
for the Honor Court vacancy
created by Lioyd Davidson's
leaving school. Carroll, Ed Arm-
field and Paul Curlee will vie
for the position in a third day
of voting Monday.

Carroll had 32 votes, Curlee 28,
and Armfield 24. The remaining
three candidates in today’s run-
off and their votes were: Joe
Jelks, 21; Peter Van Dorsten,

18; and Brooks Shelton, 15.

In yesterday's voting, 16 can-
didates competed. Those de-
feated in yesterday’s voting
were: Huck Berry, Ralph Bow-
lin, Gary DeVane, Buddy Dur-
ham, Jim Shackleford, Hobs Al-
lan, Bob Cameron, Jim Houser,
David McCorkle and Duff Arm-
field.

non, Duke, or Little.

The other major innovation is
that all freshmen who wish to
participate in rush “will be re-
quired to visit all 12 fraterni-
ties." Tom Brown explained the
need for such a plan: ‘Fraterni-
ties need to know the time and
relative number of guests for
those early open houses.”

Terry designated Oct. 30 and
Nov. 6 as the two dates for the
“regulated open houses.” De-
tails will be worked out by the
IFC Rush Committee.

The IFC unanimously adopted
a $2 rush fee for each rushes.
Treasurer Brown commented.
“This money helps defray the
cost of printing name tags, as
well as the Greek Week ban-
quet.”” This year it will also fi-
nance a special rush pamphlet,

»It was also decided that a
stenographer prepare a sum-

‘mary sheet on each freshman’s

high school activities: each
house will receive a copy for
reference purposes.

1FC BUDGET

Other major business included
a discussion. on the levying of
dues. The new budget calls for
$3 per man for first semester,
to be paid by Oct. 15. Second
semester dues will be deter-
mined in January, but they are
not to exceed $1.00.

The key factor to a balanced
IFC budget is $3 second semes-
ter due to be paid by all fresh-
man pledges. Brown said, “This
budget depends on getting 200
pledges. Since there will be
a greater choice of whether to
be a fraternity man or Inde-
pendent than ever before. a lot
of people don’t think we'll have
that many pledges.”

This year’s budget has allo-
cated funds for attending the
National Interfraternity Coun-
cil meeting and for sponsoring
a fraternity workshop at David-
son. (The latter is still just a
“possibility.”*)

NEW COMMITTEE

Terry. appointed the follow-
ing IFC committees: Johnny
Jeter, Johnny Reynolds, Stan
Brown, Dave Westfall, Dave
Perrin, rush; Mike Booe, Cal
Calhoun, Ed McFarland, Bill
Kendrick, planning; Al Carson,
Perrin, publicity; Tom Brown.
finance: Reynolds, Calhoun,
Carson, constitution.

Terry also announced that any
requests from upperclassmen
for permission to ride with
freshmen, or vice versa, should
be submitted to Stan Brown and
this committee for approval.

CHANGES NOTED

problem of excessive numbers
of flies in the dining and kitchen
areas of the cafeteria.

“He (the exterminator) comes
periodically for other kinds of
pests,’ Hill explained. “If the
weather stays cool, we probably
won't have any more problems
with flies.”

He added that the cafeteria
now has sufficient equipment
to deal with the problem if it
arises again. In addition, Hill
said that he has tried to remedy
the problem of dirty silverware,
about which there have been
several complaints.

EXTRA WASHING

“We have started a new way
of washing it," he noted, “‘by
pre-soaking it before we send
it through the machines. This
makes it easier to wash. We've

also purchased more equipment
and supplies which should help
the problem considerably.”

Hill told a group of sopho-
mores last week that there
would be two new meat dishes
at every meal. He told THE
DAVIDSONIAN that he had, in
addition, started a new cycle of
menus on Monday.

Delays in serving lines, Hill
explained, have been caused by
a shortage of silverware and
glasses.

“We have ordered more
glasses, and we already have
more silverware,"’ he comment-
ed, adding that unfortunately
the racks for trays which he
had ordered have hot yet come
in.

SOPHOMORES RETURN

The group of sophomores who

met with Hill and C. Shaw
Smith last week inspected the
kitchen last Thursday at Hill's
invitation. They said they saw
some improvements.

They had requested a sugges-
tion box, which has been in-
stalled. They noted, however,
that no bulletin board, on which
Hill was to post menus, had
been installed.

The suggestion box will be
permanent, Hill said. He told
THE DAVIDSONIAN that he
had received quite a few good
suggestions. ‘We tried to do
something,” he commented.
“about most all of them, but
there have been fewer cards
in the suggestion box during the
last few days.”

He added that neither the Stu-
dent Council nor Robert Currie,

one at Harvard thought jt up.
Computerized sex for the entire
country!

What's behind it all and how
is it possible? Well. five Har-
vard students organized the se!-
up and called it ‘Operation
Mateh.”* They've entitled them-
selves, by the way. Compatibil-
ity Research, Inc. and have un-
dertaken to match boys and girls
from 30 different sections of the
US (and England) with their
perfect dates in their own -re-
gion. Of course, the root of all
evil is the base of this enter-
prise since it takes three dollars
to participate.

The program is_ possible
through the use of a question-
naire and answer sheet (a sort
of College Board test on sex)
which the Davidson Betas are
distributing in this part of North
Carolina. But the entire Tar-
heel: State composes one region,
so a Davidsonian who sends in
his form might get names from
anywhere in the state.

UP TO 14 DATES

A participant. bony or girl. re-
ceives at least five names of
people. with whom he is compati-
ble. He can get more (up to
14) if he asks for them. but any-
one who is seriously thinking of
dating 14 girls from all over NC
probably doesn’t need a com-
puter’s help.

The project is being adver-
tised at 33 colleges in NC, plus
Winthrop and Converse, and is
designed to have an equal num-
ber of girl and boy participants.
This state's project is under the
direction of three boys at Chapel
Hill who, in turn, are respon-
sible to the headquarters at Bos
ton. The local work is being

college business manager, has
relayed any student complaints
to him.

DULL MENU

This is not to say that all is
well in the Union. On Wednes-
day several students complained
that rice, macaroni and cheese,
and black-eyed peas all appear-
ed at one meal; the only other
vegetable choice was turnip
greens.

Many students have, in addi-
tion. complained about very
long, slow-moving lines.

Hill said he will continue to
try to improve conditions. In
general, he said, “We've made
improvements menu-wise, also
in getting the help oriented to
the situation, getting them sys-
temized into what is expected
of them all through the day.”

done by different fraternities at
ftve men's schools across the
state. &

Most of the three doflars goes
to Boston. but the Betas géts 25
cents for every form sent in
from this area. The bulk of the

‘overhead is in renting the com-

puter which costs approximate:
ly $1000 an hour.

STARTED IN BOSTON

The publicity symbols for
“Operation Match’’ are the lit-
tle signs meaning male and fe-
male. that you see on ‘Ben
Casey"’ every week. These are
connected by a heart and ap-
pear around Davidson on post-
ers and buttons and in newspa-
pers. They seem to be “the
thing” these days now that play-
boy magazine uses them for
its jokes.

“Operation Match” was first
tried last fall’in the Boston
area where 9.000 people took
part. Last spring it. was done
again in the same area and
16,000 responded. Among these
were 8.200 repeats. Both of
these figures represent about 40
per cent of the people contacted.

The questionnaire was made
up by sociologists and; accord-
ing to the ads, ‘‘PhD's of all
kinds.”* It was revised after each
of the two trials. Some of the
questions on it concern religion,
personality, appearance, family
income and interest in activi-
ties. One question asks, ‘‘Do
you consider yourself sexually
experienced?"’ and offers five
answers ranging between yes
and no. A student was heard to
comment, “That's kind of
stupid. Either you have or you

haven't.’ Perhaps he’s right.
NOT LIKE ‘CUPID’

Dave Meachan, head of the:
project at Davidson. emphasizes
that it.is nothing like the “Cu-
pid Computer” which arranged
dates for the freshman mixers.
“It has more questions which
are better prepared and which
allow you to place emphasis ‘on
any area you like. And it asks
you not only about yourself but
also about your ideal date, as.
Cupid’s questionnaire didn't.”

The whole idea is ‘going over
big here, as shown by the fact
that 77 Davidson men sent in
their forms within one day aft-
er the ads began. Another sign
that it is catching on is that
several rhymes have been
thought up, most of them em-
ploying ‘‘with Operation Match”
as their last phrase.

Student Council Views
Parking Fines, Wildcat

The Student Council held one
of its shorter meetings Monday
night in which Ed Dwelle was
voted by acclamation to fill the
vacancy left by B. A. Aiken on
the Freshman Court. Aiken was
obliged to drop out of school
this year, and Dwelle was a
unanimous choice to take the
empty seat.

the Council members and an-
nounced that machines would
be installed in Cannon and Watts
dormitories and that there may
be more machines installed in
the basement of the Student
Union, Also, when the laundry
is remodeled, there will be a
row of vending machines avail-
able for student use.

The parking situation on cam-
pus was brought to light again
as Chuck Matthews informed the
Council of the graduated fine
system. Bill Council, slightly
perturbed over the actions of
the campus cops added, ‘‘Three
pages of parking regulations!
That's just too much,"’ Investt-
gation of the parking problem
is one of the items on the over-
all Student Council platform for
this school year.

Dave Powell reported on the
first meeting of the Freshmen
Council in which Craig Wilson
was elected secretary. In addi-
tion to this position, five fresh-
men were elected to a Fresh-
man Social Committee which
will work with the Student Union
Social Committee in planning
activities. The five freshmen
are John Passmore, K. D.
Weeks, John Roe, Tom O’Brien
and Bobby Vagt. After a while,
three of the five will be select-
ed to serve on the Campus So-
cial Committee.

Ben Cannon asked about the
absence of a wildcat from the
cage and Matthews offered an
explanation, saying that the
problems of feeding, care, and

proper social relations for the
animal were too much for un-
trained students to handle. He
added that the wildcat was un-
happy and irritable while here,
so Jessee Sims, the animal's
keeper, sent it to the Atlanta Zoo
at.the end of the 1963-64 school
year,

Bob Bryan and John Thomas
were absent from the meeting.
