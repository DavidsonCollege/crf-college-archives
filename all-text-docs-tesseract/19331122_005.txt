BA CASKIE NORVELL 32-

William and Mary was added to the
list of Davidson victims last Saturday,
when the Wildcats journeyed to Wil-
liamsburg to lick the sens
dians, 12-7, on two touchdowns by
“Little Joe’ Wingfield.

Johnny Mackorell, stellar Wild-
cat backfield man, again ran wild
to show that his great play against
The Citadel was no morning glory
burst of fire, but that he is the
greatest back in the Carolinas. Jake
Wade says that Corky Cornelius,
Duke flash, is the only back in the
state that even approaches Mack-
orell, and he can’t do so many of
the things that Johnny can. In
the William and Mary imbroglio,
Mackorell ran the initial kickoff
back 70 yards, and in addition
tossed passes hither and yon to put
Davidson in scoring position. He
gets an orchid.

Sharing in honors, and also receiv-
ing an orchid, is “Little Joe.” This
hunk of dynamite took many passes
from Mackorell, the Wildcat ballisti-
cian, and played tag with the William
and Mary boys, until he had shaken
himself free and ‘scored two touch-
downs. He also passed to Mackorell
in the end zone, but from across, the
field the official saw Mackorell step
out of bounds, and the play was called
back.

The play of the entire team is to
be heartily commended, and the
line work of. Potter, Rives, McEIl-
rath, Siewers, Cathey, Hand, and
Morgan was particularly outstand-
ing. “Schnozz” Willson came back
into his own, and made some of
those great tackles that he is fa-
mous for ... you know, the kind
that resound all over the field.

By licking William and Mary, Da-
vidson made a perfect season’s rec-
ord against Virginia teams, as they did
last year. The ’Cats have beaten V.
M. I., 6-0, and now have taken Wil-
liam and Mary, 12-7, Last season the
locals took V. M. I. 12-0, and Wash-
ington and Lee, 7-0. W. & L. has had
a most successful season this year, ty-
ing West Virginia and licking»Ken-
tucky. It is a pity that the Generals
and the ‘Cats don’t play this year, as
it would be a whale of a good game.

The freshman team completed a
rather disastrous season by bowing
to the Duke yearlings, 32-0. The
Davidson boys could show little
offensive, and the Blue Imps ran
wild. The freshmen tied Lees-Mc-
Rae Junior College, 6-6, in the
opener, and have lost to freshman
teams from N. C, State, V. P. I,
and Duke. Their lone victory was
a 32-0 drubbing given the Wofford

freshmen.

As Turkey Day approaches, the Da-
vidson student body is becoming Wake
Forest-minded. Last year, on Richard-
son Field, a Wildcat team that
wouldn’t and couldn't be beaten broke
a ten-year jinx, and knocked off Wake
Forest, 7-0, as Charlie Pearce inter-
cepted a Deacon pass and ran 53 yards
to touchdown, The true-toed Bruce
Peabody added the extra point, and
in his last game scored Davidson's final
point for 1932.

This year things look bright for
another Davidson victory. And
now that the old jinx is very defi-
nitely broken, there is no reason
why Davdison shouldn’t beat the
boys from Wake about three
touchdowns. It would never do for
the ’Cats to get cocky on the pre-
dicti of an t prognostica-
tor, but we still think Davidson
will win, and have plenty left
‘over.

On paper, which is a very unreliable

WILDCAT HARRIERS DOWN
CAVALIERS BY 21 TO 7

Victory Over the Virginia Team
Brings Successful Season to

Close
FRAZIER FINISHES FIRST
Merchant Falls Near End of
Race ,

Led by Captain Earle Frazier, the
Davidson harriers closed their 1933
cross-country season in a blaze of
glory when they triumphed over the
University of Virginia runners at Char-
lottesville last Saturday, 21 to 37.

The meet was run over a hilly three-
mile coures and, ‘with Frazier setting
a fairly fast 16 minutes and 5.5 sec-
onds pace, the Wildcats were able to
place six men in the first ten.

Billy Merchant, diminutive sopho-
more runner, gave the Davidson sup-
porters a scare late in the race when,
due to an indisposition, he fell out on
the road, but it proved to be nothing
serious, and he had fully recovered in
a short time.

The order in which the runners fin-
ished, with the number of points
scored by each, is as follows: Frazier
(Davidson), 1; St. John (Virginia), 2;
Oakes (Davidson), 3; Gullette (David-
son), 4; Banta (Virginia), 5; Morrow
(Davidson), 6; Glass (Davidson), 7;
McFadyen (Davidson), 8; (points do
not ‘count in team scoring), Strange
(Virginia), 9; Walcott (Virginiai), 10;
Rosenberge (Virginia), 11,

This was the last meet of the year
for the Davidson harriers, In the rat-
ing of teams in the state, and also in
Virginia, this year’s team holds a high
place. It has won three victories, tied
one meet, and lost one, this to Carolina,
who was later beaten by Duke.

In the first meet of the season, they
tied the Duke runners, last-year hold-
ers of the Southern Conference trophy.
Then they advanced through the
ranks with wins over N. C. State, 19
to 39, and Washington and Lee, 20
The boys from Chapel Hill
barely won over the Wildcats, 27 to
29, to bring the scene up to the pres-
ent.

This is the strongest showing made
by a Davidson cross-country team in
several years. The coaches expect as
strong, if not stronger, team next year.
They have arranged already for meets
with several teams in the South, in-
cluding Duke, Carolina, N. C. State,
Virginia, Washington and Lee, and
perhaps a meet with Navy. A state
meet may be arranged, and Davidson
officials are attempting to have it held
at Davidson.

Mountain: Park Downs
Davidson All-Americans

Junior College Boys Hand “All-
Americans” Their First
Licking

Last Friday afternoon on Richardson
Field the “B” team lost a hard-fought
game to Mountain Park Junior Col-
lege, the final score being 12-0.

The “All-Americans” kicked off to
Méuntain Park, «On the first play, the
Mountaineers worked a spread play
for 45 yards. Failing to gain through
the line, they attempted several passes
but to no avail. The “B” team, after
a try through the line, punted out of
danger. Neither team: showed much
drive in the first two periods. Both
teams took to the air in the second
period. The half ended with the ball
in possession of the Mountaineers on
their own 30-yard line.

Davidson's “B” team kicked off and
the receiver was stopped after a gain
of ten yards. On a reverse 20 yards
were picked up over left tackle. The
Mountaineers started a drive from
their 40-yard line to Davidson’s 6-yard
line. On the third try, Fitzgerald,
Mountain Park back, took the ball
over for a touchdown. Extra point
was not made. Late in the same quar-
ter, Walker intercepted a pass from
Sanders intended for Richardson and
raced over for the second touchdown.
Placement kick was blocked.

In the final period, both teams took

way to ‘figure football, the Wildcats
have itall over the Dekes, but one
can never tell. The Deacons have not
scored this season, and have been beat-
en by Catholic U., Duke, Carolina, and
Clemson. Their lone claim to glory is
a scoreless deadlock with N. C. State.

gain much ground by this route. The
game ended with the ball in Davidson's
Possession on their own 45-yard line.

Fitzgerald and Walker showed up
best for Mountain Park, while San-
ders, Young and Barringer were out-
standing for the “ All-Americans.”

This week the “B” team will learn
Wake Forest plays, which they will
run against the varsity in preparation
for the Thanksgiving game. A game
with the Huntersville All-Stars will
probably be played by the reserves the
latter part of the week. The “B”
team won, 18-0, the last time they
played the All-Stars.

Freshman Class Ahead
In School Basketball

Winner of Tournament to Re-
ceive 20 Points on Trophy

close, and they have been well at-
tended, the fever of excitement run-
ning high at times.

The Freshman team has defeated the
Senior team by 27-25, and the Juniors
by 33-22, The Sophomores lost to the
Juniors by 26-14, while the Seniors
won over the Junior team by 27-17,

beaten this far in the tournament.

The winner of the tournament will
receive twenty points toward the
trophy which is awarded at the end
of the year to the class having the best
intra-mural record.

Richmond University Downs the
V. M. I. “Keydets,” 15-0

Only four of Davidson’s 1933 foot-
ball opponents took part in games last
Saturday, as Duke licked Carolina,
21-0, Citadel defeated Oglethorpe, 13-0,
and V. M. I. fell victim to a strong
Richmond aggregation, 15-0.

Duke's powerful team had little dif-
ficulty in overcoming the Tar Heels,
scoring two touchdowns in the first
quarter, and one in the last. The Blue
Devils made seven first downs, scat-
tered throughout the game, while Car-
olina tallied six, all of which came in
the last half.

Horace “Horse” Hendrickson, bril-
liant Duke quarterback, led the way
with the first two scores, one counter
being made when he circled right end
for 11 yards, and the second coming
as the result of a pass to Rossiter,
halfback, which netted 31 yards.

In the Citadel-Oglethorpe contest,
the Cadets drove 67 yards to a touch-
down in the opening period, and scored
the final counter in the final quarter
when Quarterman intercepted a pass
and raced 22 yards to cross the goal
line. Oglethorpe failed to make a
single serious threat.

The splendid punting of Charlie
Quarterman, Bulldog halfback, fea-
tured the game. Time and again he
kicked out of bounds inside the Ogle-
thorpe five-yard line, and one of his
punts hit the chalk inches
from the goal,

A high light of the V. M. I.-Rich-
mond contest was the running of Perry
Schultz, Spider back, who broke
through the V. M. I. line for gain
after gain, one long gallop of 68 yards
netting the first touchdown for Rich-
mond.

The Spiders made a field goal in the
first quarter, when Joyce booted the

Freshmen End Gridiron
Season With Blue Imps

Gracy Leads ’Kittens Through
Stiff Five-Game Schedule

The Davidson freshmen gridders
played their last game of the current
football season Saturday, when they
engaged the powerful Duke University
freshmen at Asheville.

The game with the Imps marked
the end of a somewhat disappointing
season for the freshmen, who have
lost three games, fied one, and won
one. Nevertheless, they. have always
put up a good fight and shown the
spirit for which Davidson teams are
noted, :

Probably the most outstanding man
on the Davidson team is Hugh Gracy
of Franklin, Tenn.. Holding the pivot
position for the freshmen, Gracy
seemed to be in every tackle and was
the leading defensive man on the team.

Johnson and Armfield are some
others who have seen active service,
while Dickson and Cathey, stalwart
ends, old hands at snagging
passes and smearing the opposition on
end runs.

Wildkittens Show Little Power
on Offensive

Playing their final game of the cur-
season, Davidson's Wildkittens
were defeated last Saturday at Ashe-
ville by a strong aggregation of Duke
University yearlings, 32 to 0.

The Blue Imps flashed a fine offen-
sive attack and kept the ball in David-
son’s territory almost the entire game.
Accurate passing on the part of Park-
er, .Duke quarterback, netted two
touchdowns, and paved the way for
another.

The Duke frosh were unable to gain
but little through the ’Kitten line, and
on this account were forced to take
to the air, where their fine passing
attack stood them in good stead. The
Wildkittens, handicapped by a weak
pass defense, found themselves unable
to bottle up the aerial heaves of the
Blue Imps

Moreover, numerous Davidson fum-
bles of punts cost the "Kittens much
yardage, and enabled Duke to score
easily on several occasions.

Outstanding among the Blue Imps
were Quarterback Parker and Half-
back Smathers. For Davidson, Phil
Cook did a bit of pretty playing in
the backfield, while Armfield and John-
son did well in the line,
