Enrollment in Summer

School Will Be Large

Dates for Six-Week Session Will be
From June 8 to July 18

Advance registration for Davidson Col-
lege’s summer session has already reached
a high figure, according to Prof. F. K.
Fleagle, director of the summer session, and
inquiries received indicate that the final en-
rollment for the summer school will be one
of the largest which the college has ever
had.

The wide variety of subjects appealing es-
pecially to school teachers, and special teach-
ers for education methods is attracting a
large number of high. school teachers to Da-
vidson. In addition to these, regular courses
in college subjects which are being offered
are attracting a number of undergraduates.
The complete list of courses for the sum-
mer curricula has not yet been completed,
but it is expected that this will be an-
nounced in the near future. Dates for the
six-week session will be from June 8 to

July 18.

Hibbard Claims Ancients
Had Steel to Cut Rocks

Egyptians Must Have Used Steel in
Constructing Pyramids is
Assertion

New York—(IP)—“How did the Egyp-
tians cut those big rocks they used for the
pyramids?” has been a vexing question for
some centuries.

Henry D. Hibbard, a leading member of
the American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers and of the American Institute of Min-
ing and Metallurgical Engineers,
he is sure they used steel.

declares

“To deny the use of steel for stone cut-
ting by the ancient Egyptians,” he said here
recently, “is to a steel metallurgist like de-
nying the cutting itself, for hardened steel
is the only substance known to man which
could have served the purpose.”

He pointed out that before the dawn of
history the Egyptians made amazing prog-
ress, for they were able to produce beauti-
fully carved statues of hard stone.

Senior Class Will
Conduct ‘Y’ Vespers

This’ Sunday night the Senior class will
hold the weekly vesper service. This service
wilf begin the series of outdoor vespers which
are held in the spring.

The Sunday after, May 10, is Mother's
Day. A program suitable to such a day is
being arranged by the “Y.” The “Y” hopes
to find some mother who will be willing to
come and give a talk at vespers. Also there
will be special music in keeping with Moth-
er’s Day. All students are urged to have
their mothers up on this day and to attend
the vespers with them.

The Sunday after Mother’s Day, one of
the other classes will have charge of the
services.

Foreigners Pick Up
Slang Words Easily!

East Indian Learns Slang on
College Campus pl
bar renee ead |
Columbus, Ohio—(IP)—An East Indian
coming to America finds it hard not to pick |
up slang expressions and use them in his |
every-day speech. At least this has been the |
experience of Dr. B. B. Malvea, head of the
chemistry department of Ewing Christian |
College, Allahabad, India, who is. studying |

at Ohio State University. |

This ability to pick up what he calls “Yan- |
kee slanguage”’ has caused Dr. Malvea a
good deal of embarrassment since he came |
here from India a year and a half ago. His
English before he reached the Ohio State
campus was very good, he says, but now his
vocabulary is replete with phrases that he
mentally shudders at, but that slip out.

i

He finds it especially embarrassing when |
he writes letters to his friends in India, he |
says. Once he wrote that a man he had met |
in Columbus was “dumb, judging from ‘his |
conversation.” The friends couldn’t quite fig |
ure out how a man could be dumb and yet
carry on a conversation. They wrote urging
him to explain, and suggested that in future |
letters he add a_ postscript explaining his
slang remarks,

Nevertheless, the American system of edu-
cation is superior to the English system now |
used in India, he thinks. Mass education, |
which is the aim in India, he thinks,
ter accomplished by schools which give their
own examinations prepared by the govern- |
ment. He is taking a course in chemical en- |
gineering at Ohio State so his Indian pupils
will be able actual practice the
theories he gives them in the

classroom,

But he hopes that he will forget his “Yan-
kee slanguage” before he returns to India,

Planes Take Place
Of Cars on Campus

Gatlinburg, 1 tein =P) — Well, boys and
and girls, if you want to bring your air-
plane to’ college with you, get busy and
prepare to tell the dean where to head in.

Meeting here in annual conference the
deans of men in American colleges de-
cided that the next thing that’s going to
need regulation on the campus is flying.

A number of students already own their
planes, the deans have discovered in be-
tween frowns, and they set up a hue and
cry here about what would become of the
colleges if you all get them,

Automobiles owned and driven by col-
lege boys, the frowners said, have caused
a waste of student time, have contributed
to recklessness, and have congested the
campus.
