Friday, March 29, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Rusk Scholars Arrive To Participate In Davidson Experience

By ALLISON WILLS

The Rusk scholars’ first im-
pressions of life here reveal
strengths and weaknesses which
only fresh perspectives could
bring to light. The three men from
St. Paul’s school and the three
women from St. Paul’s Girls’
School, both in London, arrived at
the start of this term to take classes
and participate in every facet of
the Davidson experience.

Anna Buckley, who will at-
tend Cambridge in October, has
found students to be “very
friendly. The common level of po-
liteness is higher here.” But she
says “drawing any kind of com-
parison isn’t quite fair because
we're coming from a big.city.”

Anna has noticed how pres-
sured and fast-paced life here is,
which she attributes to our soci-
ety. “You set very rigid goals, and
you demand more immediate and
constant feedback. The English
system is more paced.” She be-
lieves the intense attitude gives us
little time for just living. “You're
either working or partying; you do
work hard, and time off is to let

”

go.

However, she insists she is not
being critical. In fact, she says she
is much less cynical about life
here than she was before arriving.
‘When you look at the surface, all
you see are signs of materialism

. cars and huge houses, and
you get the feeling that that’s what
is driving the people,” she said.
“You could think that is the only
factor if you're not careful, but I

think there must be something else
going on.”

The Rusk Scholars: Anna Buckley, Jason Smerdon, Sophie Manham, Diana Martin,

Maurice Helfgott and Richard Parsons.

Another scholar, Jason Smer-
don, will attend Durham Univer-
sity where he will major in his-
tory. Since students in Britain
must concentrate in their chosen
field very early Rusk Scholars
often choose classes outside of
their major. Smerdon is taking
Baroque Art and Opera.

“There is a lot to be said for the
broader perspective you get here,”
he said. ‘““We have to chose three
subjects at age 16 and then narrow
that to one when we attend a uni-

versity.”

Smerdon explained that there
is a conservative swing in Great
Britain like in the United States,
and he said, “Davidson seems
conservative, and likewise, cer-
tain English universities are con-
sidered conservative, and some
are liberal.”

Both Smerdon and Buckley.
attended Jacob Holdt’s slide pre-
sentation which emphasized the
inequalities which exist in the
United States. While Buckley was
hesitant to agree with Holdt’s cit-
ing Europe as an example, she be-

lieves there is much less extreme
poverty in England. “Here it’s an
isolated world, and I was shocked
to think I was sitting in Davidson
and seeing pictures of stuff going
on nearby.” Smerdon was also
shocked at the presentation, but he
said, “I was shocked less than na-
tive Americans—it isn’t my coun-
try so I was detatched enough to
just be realy interested.”

Neither wish to dwell on the
negative aspects of life in Ameri-
ca, but they had a preconception

of inequality for which they have
found some evidence. As Smer-
don said, “I didn’t realize that
every student would have a car
and various status symbols, but
people are still very generous and
open.” Anna agrees that the
friendliness has been sincere. “I
know America’s not quite ‘the
land of the free,’” she said. “But I
don’t want to come here and be
cynical, I want to see as many as-
pects as I can.”

The other Rusk Scholars are
Sophie Manham, Diana Martin,
Maurice Helfgott and Richard
Parsons. The women are housed
in Richardson, and the men are
living in Irwin and Akers.

The Rusk Scholar program
began in 1977, in honor of Dean
Rusk, a 1930 alumnus who was a
Rhodes scholar and Secretary of
State. It has provided tuition for
six or seven students to study here
spring term before attending uni-
versities. Helen Wallace, one of
the founders of the program still
assists in selecting the partici-
pants. She is currently keeper of
maps in the British Library.

The scholars are required to
take two classes, and failure in a
class will take away a scholarship
for the following year. Otherwise,
these grades are inconsequential
for them.

In the past, Rusk scholars
have put on various productions
with one group organizing an En-
glish tea party on the lawn. They
have particularly appreciated our
physical education courses—
especially water sports which are
rare in Great Britain.

must file charges against a student
no more than ten days after the
Dean receives a complaint about
that student. The student then has
a maximum of ten days to prepare
his defense before a hearing oc-
curs.
Under the new proposal, the
defendant can exclude a
maximum of 25 days from the pre-
scribed time limit applicable dur-
ing the year. Under the previous
guidelines, the Dean could post-

pone a hearing until the next
school year if he thought it appro-
priate. According to Rosselot, the
new arrangement “prevents let-
ting things drag out to the point
that people can’t remember.”

In addition to the measures
awaiting a second SCC vote, the
Council considered many possible
changes in Honor Council pro-
ceedings at meetings March 19th
and 26th.

One issue that was “discussed
a long time,” according to Terry,
was whether the Honor Council
should require open hearings of all
cases. Terry said the Council gen-

they want to be emphasized,” he
said. He said more glamorous pro-
jects such as the Dean Rusk En-
dowment and the Athletic Com-
plex attract donations more read-
ily than the maintenance of tech-
nological equipment.

Associate Dean of Faculty and
Chemistry Department Chairman
Nicholas Burnett, who assists
Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs and Dean of the Faculty T.C.
Price Zimmermann in allocating
academic budgets, said he consid-
ers the suspension of the SEM an
“internal, department matter,” of
the Biology Department. He said
all academic departments which
have laboratory programs have to
pay for maintaining their equip-
ment from department operating
funds. He said the College has “‘no
special, allocated funds” which

could be used for he SEM service
contract.

Burnett said the College
budget allocated funds to the Biol-
ogy Department according to Wil-
liamson’s request. ‘“‘We haven't
cut back (on Biology Department
funding). He’s been given what
he’s asked for.”

He said Wiliamson requested
for additional funding this year
when he was told the SEM service
contract would come out of the
Biology department operating
budget. Burnett said he then told
Williamson that no additional
funds were available.

Williamson said the lack of
funding for SEM contract illus-
trates a larger question of David-
son’s dedication to maintaining its
technological instruments. “The
SEM is just the tip of the iceberg,”
he said.

erally agreed that to require open
hearings would be unfair to any
student who wished a closed hear-
ing. “We decided that the choice
has to be left up to the defendant,”
Council member Laura Kline
said. She said Davidson might
risk its high return rate of students
found guilty of honor charges if
open hearings were mandatory.
The Council also considered
requiring student solicitors and
defense advisors, who run for of-
fice in pairs, to include one mem-
ber to serve for one year and one
for two years. The Council re-
jected this proposal for several
reasons. Rosselot and Terry said
that SCC members felt the sol-
icitor and defense advisors deal
with too much pressure to serve
two consecutive terms. Also
Terry said the “level of maturity”
of a senior is important to deal

with this pressure.

The Honor Council decided
not to eliminate hearsay evidence
from Council proceedings. Hear-

“say evidence is evidence of what

one person has said, reported to
the hearing by someone else. Ac-
cording to Kline, “It’s very hard
with somebody not trained in law
to decide what is hearsay and what
is not hearsay.” SCC members
wrote to Judge J. Dickinson Phil-
lips, a 4th Circuit of Appeals Jus-
tice who wrote the Code of Dis-
ciplinary Procedures, to elicit his
advice on whether the use of hear-
say evidence should be abolished
in the Code of Disciplinary Proce-
dures.

According to Terry, Phillips
recommended that hearsay evi-
dence continue to be treated in the
Code as it is now. Hearsay evi-
dence is allowed in the proceed-

ings, but Council members must
be warned that it should be treated
with caution and not be given too
much weight, Terry said.

Rosselot said she _ believes
hearsay evidence should be al-
lowed in Council hearings. “If
you can envision a situation in
which it [hearsay evidence] can be
helpful, it is absolutely necessary
to leave it in.”

According to Kline, the Honor
Council open hearing last fall, in
part prompted the SCC decision to
change the Code of Disciplinary
Procedures. ‘It was definitely a
reason [for the procedure
changes],” Kline said.

The SCC will examine the
process of investigating Honor
cases and the order of final argu-
ments by defense advisors and

solicitors at its meeting on Tues-
day.
