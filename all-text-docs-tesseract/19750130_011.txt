‘‘With a lot of hard work and
recruiting I am confident that
Davidson will be able to com-
pete successfully in the South-
ern Conference,’’ said first-
year swimming coach Pat
Drake.

Drake, who spent five years
at the University of South
Carolina doing undergraduate

and graduate work, is no
stranger to athletics.
“Although the woman’s

athletic program at USC was
not very well developed I did
play a lot of tennis, volleyball,
and of course swim,’ said
Drake.

A native of Greenville, South
Carolina, Drake. gained her
coaching experience at Pot-
sdam State College in Potsdam,
New York before taking over
the swimming program at
Davidson.

Commenting on this year’s
‘team Drake explained, ‘‘There
have already been  im-
provements in several of the
swimmer’s time over some of
their times last year. Hopefully
this trend will continue.”

Davidson’s swimming team
was split at 2-2 going into.the
meet against UNC-Asheville
Tuesday.

Aiding Miss Drake is diving
coach Dave Mosure, -coaching
Davidson’s two capable divers
Ted Mumby and Eric Vernon.

‘Our divers were responsible

for our win over Augusta
College last week, especially
sophomore Ted Mumby,’’, said
Drake.

“Ted works out hard every
day on the board and we expect
a lot out of him,’’ added Drake.

is relatively large for a school

The two girl members of the

timistic about Davidson’s
future, especially in view of
several outstanding freshmen
swimmers.

“Freshman Jonathan Wash-
burn has improved 12 seconds
on his breaststroke and 13
seconds on his individual
medley,” said Drake.

“‘We are also pleased with the
performances of freshman
Marshal Brown who swims the
butterfly and Mike Knowies
who is an excellent free-styler,”’
Drake said.

There are 19 members on the

Areas of specialization include regeneration,

they do swim in competition
with the boys and there is a psy-
chological element involved.”

Some of the experienced up-
perclassmen form the strongest
part of the team.

“Senior John Scholler is our
most effective distance swim-
we rely on for the sprint
events,’’ explained Coach

“It is going to take a lot of
work to compete with some of
the teams that we are to go up
against for the remainder of the
season,” Drake said.

Drake added, ’’Junior Jack ”

backstroke and he has recently
started to improve on his time.”’

The swimming team prac-
tices six days a week, two hours
aday.

Furman, VMI, Appalachian
State, Georgia Southern, and
Duke.

“T think we will have our best
chances against Furman while
Georgia Southern and Duke will
be our toughest meets,”’ predic-
ted Drake.

“Performances thus far this
season have been up and down,
with Doscher and Washburn as
well as divers Mumby and Ver-
non performing most con-
sistently,”’ reflected Drake.

the Mid-Winters week-end.
Davidson got their hoped for
decisive win over Emory, but
was unable to defeat the ex-
cellent Tech team.

“If Davidson is going to keep
up with the other Southern Con-
ference teams, the swimming
program will have to be in-
tensified. Recruiting, though
there aré no scholarships, is
already being stepped up and
several good swimmers are
now being sought,” explained
Drake.

Drake is pleased with the in-
terest that has been shown in
swimming both as a team sport
and for pleasure.

“Several faculty members
and their wives swim fsequen-
tly. It really is a good exercise,”
said Drake. .

Not all swimmers on the team
have had a great deal of swim-
ming experience.

“Such members as Ralph
Taylor, Cal Morton, and Steve
Barnes had not swum com-
petitively until they came to
college,’’ observed Drake.

In her first year as a coach at
Davidson Drake has had full
cooperation from the athletic
department.

“People have : been really
helpful to me here; they’ve
given me everything that I have
asked for.”’

Added Drake, ‘‘I am enjoying
coaching here at Davidson.”
