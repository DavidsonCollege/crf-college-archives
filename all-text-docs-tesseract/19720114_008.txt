Trustees Re

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

The Trustee Governance Com.
mittee began deliberations last
Friday on the entire governance
structure.

The committee agreed that
all college documents including
the Faculty Ccusiitution, the
Revised Trustee By-laws, and
the Student Government Asso
ciation Constitution should be
examined.

The Committee passed a mo.
tion saying it will now begin
discussions ‘“‘with a view to-
wards determining the major
areas of decisicn-making and
towatd establishing the preroga-
tives and responsibilities within
those areas of the various con-
Stitutiences of the college (stu-

POON SEL BR RE CORR

dents, faculty, administration
and trustees).”

These constituent groups will
be asked ‘‘to review and make
recommendations” i respect of

any reports submitted by the

Governance Committee to the.

Board of Trustees.

The committee also listed
several governance problems
which should be discussed in
subsequent meetings.

1. Communication and mis-
understanding among the vari-
ous groups:

°. Exclusion of students from
decision-making process:

3. Concern for the stability of
the current system particularly
relative to the Faculty Consti-
tution, and interest in its as vet
unactualized potential:

Stopgap Measures Fail; —
Show Lack Of Foresight

AN ANALYSIS
By TODD EADES
Staff Writer

Ilave you ever wondered why
it takes so long for most major
changes at Davidson to occur?
Davidson is definitely behind,
and is reacting to, instead of
planning for, the future.

The comprehensive fee, as a
financial remedy, seems to be
iu plan which is several years
too late. Arrived at over the

view Governance

4, Present prerogatives of the
various groups;

5. Lack of faith in the present
system, particularly in the case
of students who must petition
the official group with which
it is in conflict, with no third-
party appeal:

6. After - the -fact consultaton
with the various groups;

7. Confusion on the interrela-
tionship of authority, and what
bodies make what decisions:

8. Secrecy in policy-making:
9. Non academic personnel in
the decision making process:
10. The question of Davidson
College as a separate and uni-
que governing unit and/or as a
part of national trend in col-
lege governance.

student movements, institution-
alized or ad hoc, depends on
access to information.

How can you argue with the
financial officers of the college
about coeducation when you
can't put your hands on the
financial reports of the college?
And so on.

This problem was brought
home to me Monday night in
the question and answer session
with the candidates: I was
struck by the low level of know-
ledge manifested in many of
the questions.

Students must challenge the
college on the basis of their
knowledge. Yet the spoken and
unspoken restrictions on infor-
mation and the difficulty of
communicating with the entire
student body when there are no
longer any common meetings
of the entire community make
this almost impossible.

Student government in the
last year was not successful
with this perennial problem. For
those students who continue to
work actively in campus af-
fairs, the challenge to the policy
uf ‘‘gentlemanly secrecy in the
best interests of the institution”
must be a daily responsibility.

I do not believe for one min-
ute that the college could de-
fend its position on coeducation
if the administration daily had
to confront student after stu-
dent asking pressing, embarras-

‘sing questions.

The students elected to office
cannot accomplish this alone; it
is the responsibility of every:
one here. If student government
has failed, then so have we all.

This 1s what is meant when

the student body constitution
says that the SGA is the entire
student body and not just the
senate and officers.

Looking to the immediate fu-
ture, 1 think there will he two
issues of overriding importance
in the next year.

Coeducation is clearly one of
these; the task will he to force
the college to live up to com-
mitments of long standing, and
this is where individual support
for student, faculty, and admin-
istrative eforts to move the is-
sue off dead center will be most
important.

But in the jong run the more
bitter and acrimonious struggle
will take place over govern-

ance. Who decides who decides?
And who will surrender power
and who will gain?

These are the questions that
strike at the bottom of all oth-
ers, and they will be the most
difficult to resolve since they
affect basic institutional rela-
litnships among all the groups
on campus.

The danger is that student
demands for greater participa-
tion in decision-making will be
too easily surrendered: the cor-
responding temptation will be
to deny the validity of faculty,
administration and trustee roles
in the governance of the college.
We are only beginning, to work
our way out of this tangle.

So that’s it.

summer, it appears to be a
reacticn to financial and educa-
tional problems rather than a
preventative to forestall such
problems.

Comprehensive fee is a strong
preventative to the revival of
fraternities, but the fraternities
are near final departure any-
way. The college appears to be
involved in a case of overkill.

The senate communicated sev-
et) recommendations on com-
prehensive fee to the adminis-
tration and one, and only one,
meeting has been held. Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan, as chairman of
the group, has not called anoth-
er meeting to inform students
of the progress the administra-
tion has made on the several!
proposals they accepted.

Recently the school has made
overtures towards coeducation.
At least there is a lot of noise,
and its about time. All the Ivy
League schools are either coed
or have sister schools. Perhaps
our “‘brethen” to the northeast
have once again surpassed us.

That Davidson tends to react
to problems in lieu of anticipa-
tion is further seen by the de-
cision to ‘‘temporarily” house
the Union, or rather part of the
Union, or rather still, the offices
of the Union administrators, in
the Guest House. I wonder if
the old gymnasium was to tem-
porarily house the Union.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. will have to think
very hard and very long about
building a new Unicu very soon,
or somehow face the present
social inadequancies as they in-
tensify in the future. Davidson
is hardly a dynamic college, jt
merely moves the old things
around in novel configurations.

The college has already be-
gun propagating ‘‘the union is
not a building, it is an idea” in
their material to prospective
students.

Yet at other schools unions
are certainly buildings where
activities are organized and fo-

- culum,

|

cused.

The administration tells stu-
dents that the next few years
will be ones of transition and
the problems to be endured by
this generation of students must
be faced sometime.

It is unfortunate that the class
of 1974 will spend half its time
at Davidson without a_ union
building and will be expected
to put up with the inconvenience
aud annoyance of construction
for two years without any of the
benefits of the new library, The
class of ‘75 and probably that
of ’76 will not see a new union
building either, due to lack of
planning by the college.

The present student body is
pay:ng the price for future stu-
dents. This is normal as past
students have sacrificed for us.
But the student at Davidson
College in the years '71-74 is
also paying for the inexcusable
lack of positive planning in the
past.

This period of transition the
students must endure can be
considerably brightened by pos-
itive evidence of progressive
planning in areas which are al-
most upon us. Changing times
for students should also be
changing times for faculty, and
adm-nistration.

Planning and implementation
of such projects as the com-
pletion of the Blue Sky curri-
coeducation, and the
constiuction of a new union
building should be thought about
now. The need is recognized
now. Financial, educational, and
social problems cannot be met
with stop-gap measures such as
the comprehensive fee. The
only adequate approach _ is
through foresight.
