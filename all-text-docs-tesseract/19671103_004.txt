Group Asks
Vacation
Extension

By CHUCK GREEN
Staff Writer
The Academic Scheduling
Gommittee, now an advisory
group. has recommended that
the Christmas holidays be ex-

tended one day through Jan.
9

This recommendation will
now be passed on to the fac-
ulty Executive Committee.
according to Dy. Frontis

Johnston, dean of the facul- —

ty. The Executive Committee
sets the agenda for the fac-
ulty meetings. and thus any
business must pass through
its hands first.

‘Johnston said. “It makes
no difference to me personal.
ly. It’s all right to change it
(the date) if there is enough
time in the schedule.”

It is up to President D.
Grier Martin to call a meet-
ing of the Executive Com-
mittee. Martin has been out
of town this week. Bill Bon-
durant. special assistant to
the President: said that no
date had been set for the ex-
ecutive meeting. but that it
will probably be before the
next faculty meeting on No-
vember 14.

Dr. Joseph T. Drake. chair-
man of the advisory Academ-
ic Scheduling Committee. said
that coming back on Jan. 2
was traditional.

The committee made its
recommendation, Drake said.
with the idea that it is ‘‘bet-
ter not to get the students
back. here the day after the
night before.”

Drake said that there would
be enough days to meet the
requirements of the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Universities as to semester
length.

Hight Notes Many Changes

In Graduate Record Exams

Citing the notable changes
in some of the achievement
tests of the Graduate Record
Examination administered
last Saturday to Davidson
seniors, Dr. William Hight ex-
pressed some concern about
student scores.

Hight, director of the stu-
dent counseling service, re.
ferred specifically to the his-
tory and English achievement
tests.

“The noticeable change in
the history test was the in-
clusion for the first. time: of
oriental history."’ Hight said.
“Therefore. unless the  stu-
dent in history had done per-
sonal reading on the East, he
probably had a_ hard time
with the test."

Hight noted that past tests
had included occasional ref-
erences to oriental history

but mainly as it relates to
the United States. According
to him, this: year’s test in-
cluded numerous references
to specific dynasties and par-
ticular events.

“The history test trend
seems to be developing more
and more in correspondence
to the tide of current affairs.”
Hight added. “Since interest
today is focused on the East,
so was the test."

The English achievement.
test also had some major
changes.

According to Hight, there
was much more emphasis
placed on American literature
than in past tests.

The English student had to
be very familiar with indi-
vidual styles within given pe-
riods. Hight said, in order to
complete the identifications

of various passages. He said
that the actual test was much:
more difficult than the sam-
ple tests.

A total of 92 seniors took
the first administration of the
test this year. This repre-
sents, according to Hight, a
big increase over past years.

The test. which is the na-
tional test program which
may be used as a criterion
for admission to graduate
school. is administered four
times per school year.

The next test will be ad-
ministered on Dec. 9. Regis-
trations must be completed
by Nov. 21.

The Student Counseling of-
fices maintains files of past
tests and sample questions
for use by seniors who wish
to prepare for the tests.

Three standing committees
were proposed: a Social
Committee. an Appropriations
Committee and a Publicity

Committee.

The appropriations commit-
tee will determine the use of
the $250 in the freshman
treasury.

The installation of more
telephones so that each floor
of the freshmen dorms will
have one is a definite possi-
bility. The council has con-
tacted Southern Bell Tele-
phone Company.

Coke. candy. coffee and
milk machines may be put
on the first floors of the fresh-
man dorms if the council can
get support for this project. A
switch to canned drinks in.

Group Suggests
23-Man Senate

A Senate membership of
23 will be proposed by the
Constitution Revision Com.
mittee when it reports to the
Student Council, according to
Mike Bates, chairman of the
group.

The proposal represents a
decrease of nine members
from the previously-set total
of 32. However, the member
ship of 23 still represents an
increase of eight over present
Student Council membership.

The Constitution Revision
Committee was appointed by
the Student Council last April
to rewrile the Student-Body
Constitution.
