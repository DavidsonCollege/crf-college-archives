The Barber of Seville treats virgin ‘Davidson audience

By MERIDETH DURDEN

The hundreds of Halloween-
ers in Love Auditorium last
night got a real treat. The New
York City Opera Theatre Com-
pany presented Rossini’s “The

a

Barber of Seville” in an enthu-,

siastic production that was
quite simply fun.

The opera-comique at first
conceived by Caron de Beau-
marchais, was intended to do
more than entertain. Beaumar-
‘chais wrote a three-part novel in
the 18th century which centered
on the Barber of Seville. Gioac-
chino Rossini set the first book
to music—this is what David-
son saw last night.

Since this was written in
the 18th century during a time

of French and English conflict, .

there, is a social edge that
today’s audiences don’t com-
pletely catch.

The second book about the
barber was set to music by

FIGARO (ALFRED Anderves) loughs houstiy at tha despa of

‘be inventive,’’

Mozart. It is entitled the ‘“‘Mar-

riage of Figaro” and contains
the same characters. The third
book was never set to music,

probably because in this final —

text Beaumarchais detailed the
deaths of many of his charac-

, ters.

All history aside, what came
across indast night’s perfor-
mance was the comedy and its
energy. The translation of the
work itself was excellent. Lines
like ‘“Money is_a great incen-
tive. Now I want to see you
peppered the
script..

“Opera is not an elitist
thing,” explained music profes-
sor James Swisher. ‘‘That’s
why we do operas in English.
Mr. Swisher commented that
there were some diction prob-

lems in last night’s perfor-

mance. “The consonants were
not stressed enough.” This was
apparent especially in the chor-
us and ensemble scenes. Then

Ceunt Almaviva (Roger Lucas.) Figaro was such a dynamic
character he ahnost overwhelmed the other performers.

THE DAVIDSON audience responded warmly to its first opera experience. One wonders why

the standard Davidson gesture of appreciation—the standing ovation—was missing.(Gregg Strader)

one was bombarded by the
words and music and the effect
was often less concentrated on

the words and meanings and

more attention to the costumes,
set and acting.

‘“‘In opera there are three
things going on simultaneous-
ly—words, music and action,”
explained Dr. Swisher. ‘‘Our
tendency in the 20th century
has been to train our singers.
We need all three equal.”

The ability of the performers
to act was indeed overshadowed
by their ability to sing. The
exception to this was Alfred

rather left one wondering about
who should be considered the
lover.

But Liicas redeemed himself
in subsequent scenes. His dis-
guises as a drunkard and music
professor worked effectively.
His wimpy red-haired rendition
of the ‘‘Don Alfonso’’ was

“The costumes were excellent
and quite detailed. The flowered
fan, ruffled bodices, and Spa-
nish shawls of Rosina were
especially convincing. The
Count was divinely dressed in
gold, blue and white brocade in
the last ‘scene; this contrasted —
nicely with the buffoonery of his

bined to make Don Alfonso a
hysterical character.

In the final scene this dom-

Count was overshadowed by the

that he almost overshadowed

his reach. The subsequent ent-

tumes complete with tortoise-
shell hair comb, red flowers
behind her ears, and ruffled
gowns, helped to complete the
image.

The sets were typical of those
of a travelling show— minimal.
Although they did not effective-
ly project the startling beauty
of Seville, they did serve as a
white-washed showcase for the -
colorful characters, to dance
around on. In the opinion of
Assistant Professor of Drama
Joe Gardner, the sets did indeed

“remain subservient to the ac-
tors.” But this neutral kind of
background made the actors in
costume look bright.

overshadow what was going on
on stage. Perhaps this. is be-
cause opera orchestras are us-
ually. placed in pits and there-
fore are used to playing a little
louder. In any event, the orch-
estration was excellent—the
sight of those long-haired and
involved ‘ihusicians ‘sometimes
just as interesting as the events -
on stage.

According to the company
members themselves; the Dav-
idson audience was “one of the
best we’ve ever had.” William
Brown and others at the Union
are to be congratulated for
selling out the Bouse. Instead of

_ ringing doorbells and collecting

candy, the nearly-packed house
at Love Auditorium got an even
sweeter treat—a thoroughly en-
joyable evening of comedy op-
era.
