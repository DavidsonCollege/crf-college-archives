By THE BOOZE BROTHERS
And now for you lovers of cul-
ture, it’s time for sport. We've got
some good news for you. . . as a
parting gesture to the college (and
also to spite Oral Roberts), Char-
lie Chaplain has performed one of
the greatest miracles of our age
and raised the old Booze Brothers

column from the dead. Except we -

are not the same old Booze
Brothers that we used to be back in
*83 — we're the Born Again
Booze Brothers. that’s B.A.B.B.
for short. |

it’s certainly good to be alive
again, to see the freshmints walk-
ing cluelessly around in flocks (or
herds as the case may be after a
few weeks of commons food); to
hear the lovely sounds of Judas
Priest, The Fat Boys, REM, Whit-
ney Houston, AC/DC, J. S. Bach,
Lynard Skynryd, Tiny Tim, The
Beastie Boys, Willie Nelson, Run
DMC and The Cure simultane-

Spoof of the Wee

ously from the quad; to smell the
sweet aroma from the dumpsters
behind Little and Watts; to get
trampled by a mob of foaming-at
the-mouth demoniac humanoids
in the scramble for the keg at a
Hod party; and all those other
lovely little pleasures of the
“Davidson experience.”
B.A.B.B. were shocked by
the freshmint talent show. It
seems this year they tried some-
thing completely the opposite of
previous years — to find the least
talented freshmint. Unfortunately
for the least talented class in Chal-
mers Davidson’s memory, the
show was stolen by those two very
un-funny KKKA hall counselors
who MCed this travesty and suc-
ceeded in getting a negative read-
ing. on the laughometer.
B.A.B.B. were not that aware fel-
lows who were so good at not

‘being witty actually existed. We

came to the conclusion that al-

though there is little that can be
done to fill the void of talent in the
new batch of freshmints, some-
thing could be done to improve
their lack of knowledge and social
awareness of D.C. Thus we are
going to inform you young
freshmints of ten things that they
didn’t tell about Davidson during
orientation.

“Underage consumption of al-
cohol is permissible as long as you
don’t throw beer cans at those
sneaky campus security officers.

‘Most freshmints (mainly of
the Richardson variety) gain con-
siderable amounts of weight eat-
ing at the commons.

-If the dean of students doesn’t
mention your name when he
greets you, it’s because he’s for-
gotten it.

Advice to embarrassed

freshmen

By BILL SCOUTEN
Picture this: the stage is set

and the curtain opens. Out walks a

eshman (we'll call him “Jack”).

e is dressed in a tie, coat and
pants. (he looks pretty sharp). As

e begins his act, someone yells
out...
What’s wrong with this scene?
eemingly nothing is amiss . . .
at least that’s what Jack thinks! In
actuality, Jack is about to be
aught smack in the middle of a
social spoof, a blunder which
promises to embarrass Jack and
reate table conversation for at
east the next week. Yes, Jack’s
y was unzipped. Jack was em-
barrassed, in front of. the whole
eshman class, not to mention a
ouple of upperclassmen, but he
ook it in style. “I just wanted to
see if you could pick it up,” he
said.

Or what about the freshman,

ow a sophomore, who found his

vehicle? The solution seemed re-
ally elementary to him: put the car
into neutral and let gravity do the
work. Gravity did its work, all

right, and so did the body shop

mechanic on a door that was
nearly ripped off its hinges. Ayear
and six hundred dollars later, his
friends still talk of his mishap and
laugh: “what a spoof!”

So, what exactly is a spoof?
Well, it’s a blunder, an embarras-
sing happening in one’s life that
can, in the end, be looked upon
and laughed at. Stated simply,.a
spoof is an event so outrageous
and socially disturbing that it
merits comment.

Freshmen, beware! Watch out
for the tell-tale signs of a situation
which promises disaster. Look at
yourself closely before leaving
your room in the morning; are you.
fully clothed? If you encounter an
illegally parked car in front of
yours in the parking lot, don’t
move it; it may have Power brakes

and thus none at all while stalled.
The final, and probably most im-
portant warning, is: BEWARE
OF THE BOTTLE. Alcohol is
one of the most frequent causes of
social spoofs around the
world . . .too much can cause a
regular Davidson student to be-
come the laughingstock of the
campus.

So, freshmen, enjoy your-

* selves, delight in the freedom that

Davidson has to offer, but re-
member, behind every door lurks
anew situation. . . a poised spoof
ready to spring to life. Don’t let it
get-you!

Editor's note: students, staff,
faculty, friends, Romans, coun-
trymen: have you witnessed or
been the victim of a spoof re-
cently? Write in to Mr. Scouten
with the particulars. Also: in case
you didn’ t know, Mr. Scouten was
the perpetrator of the rolling car
goof. Let's just keep the record
straight, shall we, Bill?

R.EM. rides the fence’.

By LEE EICHELBERGER

Ever been to an R.E.M. con-

cert? They do a lot of covers of old
material that most Yuppies-to-be
have never heard of. I wish they
would do Johnny Cash’s “I walk
the line.” I'd like that not because
it’s a great country standard but
because it so accurately describes
the band’s situation. What other
band to date can sell millions of al-
bums, claim a cult following of
american youth, while skirting
pop, rock, and underground terri-
tory, yet without a top twenty
‘single? A year ago I might have
said U2, but. . . I don’t mean to
say that R.E.M. is on the brink of
exploding into the mainstream.
Quite the opposite is true.
R.E.M. has found a comforta-
ble place riding the fence and their
latest release only makes it more
comfortable. Document is an
album that offers something for
everyone. We start with an arena-
quality rocker in the form of
“Finest Worksong”. Pausing for a
brood, Stipe moans “Welcome to
the Occupation”. Next we dabble
in- a political(!) song (in other

words music w/a message) in

which Stipe pokes Yuppies with a
rubber knife. (I mean “you’re
walking on coals/ to improve your
business acumen” is hardly a bit-
ing lyric.) Next the combo trans-
forms Wire’s new wave classic
“Strange” into a genuine, frat boy, —
house rocker (you can dance to
it — even sing along). The album
continues with such notables as
“It’s the End of the World as We
Know it (and I Feel Fine)” and
“Disturbance at the Heron
House.” There’s even one to de-
light bland radio programmers —
“The One I Love.” My personal
favorite is “Lightnin’ Hopkins,”
the only R.E.M. song that has re-
ally sounded distinctive in years.

Don’t get me wrong — I like the
new R.E.M. album. . . really.
But this is not the band that cap-
tured my imagination with Mur-
mur and Chronic Town. Lovers of
the band since Fables will add
Document to their collections
with glee, but I do.so with a sigh
and wait. for them boys from
Athens to get off their fence and
stand up for something other than
ambiguity.
