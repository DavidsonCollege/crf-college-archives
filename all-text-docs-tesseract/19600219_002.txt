A Challenge To Fraternities

The recent IMAC decision is, we
are afraid, an example of the short-
range view that is so often seen on
the campus. Briefly, here is the story.

Prompted by the high rate of
fraternity men declaring non-affilia-
tion with their respective fraternities,
the IMAC thought it necessary to
formulate a policy concerning the
eligibility of inactives to play for the
Independents. Accordingly, the men.
in question were ruled unable to play
for this team.

There are two factors that should
be examined at this point. The first
is that although the Independents
have a seat on the IMAC, it is only
one out of thirteen, and it is obvious
that the twelve fraternities can con-
trol any decision.

And there is one other point. It
became evident that for the first
time, perhaps, the Independents were
actually holding their own and even
winning some games.

On this fraternity-overloaded
campus, this seemed to be unthink-
able. The easiest thing to do was for
the fraternities, through their repre-

sentatives, to declare the inactives
not eligible for the Independent team.

We may be wrong. Perhaps the
decision was not based on selfishness,
but if it were, we cannot see how a
clear conscience can condone it.

What of the erstwhile fraternity
men who are denied the right to play
for their fraternity? Are they to be
left without a team? Looks like it.

What is wrong with a strong Inde-
pendent team? Another strong team
will result in a stronger intramural
program, and this opportunity should
not be missed.

If a strong athletic team will make
for a stronger Independent group as
a whole, and we think it will, we're
for it. One of the greatest dangers
inherent in a strong system of any
kind is that of apathy and false as-
suredness. This, we think, may be
true of the fraternity system here.

The advent of a strong outsider
can make the complacent system sit,
up and take notice, and will, we
think, result in an all-round improve-
ment.

We think the fraternities can stand
it.

The Bugbear Didn't Vanish After All

A little dust was stirred up
Wednesday. A few brows were fur-
rowed and a few voices were raised
in heated discussion.

Thursday the dust had settled.
The brows were smooth again and
the voices had gone.

Wednesday was the day of the
Trustee’s meeting here on the cam-
pus. It was the day that the DAVID-
SONIAN appeared, advocating a joint
student-faculty-administration- trustee
committee to study the problem of
race as regards the admission policies
of Davidson College. It was the day
that Henry Shue and friends present-
ed a petition to the Trustees signed
by over two-hundred and fifty stu-
dents requesting further study on the
study of the problem. It was the day
that Dave Robinson appeared before
the Trustees and presented a stu-
dent’s view on integration. It was the
day the results of the faculty poll
were given to this august body.

Wednesday was the day that the
Trustees decided to do nothing at all
about the -matter.

Thursday the Trustees were gone
and a campus that had been awake
returned to its normal state of half-
closed eyes.

We talked to Dr. J. McDowell
Richards immediately after the Trus-
tees had adjourned for another three
months. We asked him what steps
had been taken on the race problem.

“The Trustees of Davidson Col-
lege appreciate the concern of the
students for the welfare of Davidson
College,” he said. “However, no ac-
tion was taken on this problem. It is

An Invitation

One of the strongest comments
that we have heard about the Special
Edition that was published Tuesday
was the complaint that the issue
stated only one side of the question,
and that the viewpoint was 00

biased.

We would like to make it clear
that the issue was in no way intended
merely to agitate or to hear ourselves

my personal opinion that nothing
will be done on this matter for over
a year.”

This simply means that the state-
ment, “It is not in the best interest of
Davidson College to admit Negroes at
this time,” is still the official doctrine.

Before the meeting of the board, .

the DAVIDSONIAN stated that it be-
lieved this statement was sorely in
need of clarification, explanation and
justification. We still feel the same
way.

We understand that there are
certain elements on the board itself
that are totally dissatisfied with this
statement. We know there are cer-
tainly many members of the student
body and faculty that, find it wholly
inadequate.

The fact that the College Union
was humming with sincere discussion
Wednesday evening is ‘proof that
Wednesday’s questions did not go for
naught. Our desire in presenting the
issue was that such discussion would
result. We did not pretend to offer
a panacea that would dissolve all the
unpleasant aspects of this problem.

We still hope that the Trustees
will set up a joint committee at their
May meeting so that this issue may
be pursued realistically and so a more
meaningful position can be formulat-
ed. We feel the fact that this is a
Christian College demands that the
Trustees consider this matter more
fully.

We can turn our backs on a prob-
lem for just so long. Sooner or later
we have to turn around and face it
squarely.

talk. We think that the segregation
question deserves and _ requires
thoughtful consideration and discus-
sion.

We are eager to present both
sides of the issue, however. Our pages
are open for anyone who will write
a statement of justification of a seg-
regated Davidson. We ask that such
articles be submitted to the editor
for publication.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

Writer Laments Campus Theft;
Another Levels Fire On IMAC

David Briefen

Dear Editor,

It is with regret that I write
this letter and yet, at this time,
it seemed the only thing to do.

Last weekend, while I was not
in my room and while, as usual,
my door was unlocked ( 1 had
great faith in the Davidson
honor system), someone either
borrowed or outrageously stole
a blanket. The financial. diffi-
culty that this will cause is bad
enough. What is worse, how-
ever, is that the honor system
has been violated.

In as much as it is stil) the
middle of the winter and cold
at night, I would appreciate
your publishing this [etter in
the hopes that either the thief
will have a change of heart, or
the borrower, a sudden recovery

of memory. The blanket was a
light brown tweed ST. MARY'S

Dear Editor:

If an American ever becomes
a Communist, even for a day,
that action is held against him
almost for the rest of his life.
On this campus the inactive
fraternity man is treated by the
IWiAC as a Communist is treat-
ed by. the government. “Once
a Communist, always a Commu-
nist,” they say, no matter how
much he does later to reject
it.

How inuch more can a person
protest certain actions of a
fraternity than by breaking all
visible ties with his fraternity?
What more ca he do to “quit?”

The IMAC has ruled that in-
active frat men cannot be In-
dependents. The most amazing
thing about this ruling is that
a previous decision was revers-
ed when the Independents be-
gan winning in sports (an un-
usual condition), using  in-
actives. Thus far the Indepen-
dents are undefeated in basket-
ball and handball.

The one way to prevent this
from recurring was obvious.
The inactives were declared
ineligible to play, ball with the
Independents,

The Student Body should not
support this injustice. Either a
reversal of the decision should
be enacted, or the name of the
organization should be changed
to the “Interfraternity Athletic
Council.”

Why Is The Library Inadequate?
Gravely Repsris, Offers Ideas

By Allan Gravely

Toward the end of last year
I had an experience which is
an often repeated one among
Davidson College students: not
being able to find a certain
desired book in the library.

Naturally. this stimulated my
interest as to why there were
not more books in the library,
and this article is the end re.
sult of my researches into the
matter.

REASONS

There are several reasons why
the library is small. The most
important reason is that many
people concerned with the col-
lege are of the opinion that an
undergraduate liberal arts
school needs only a_ certain
basic list of titles patterned
after the Harvard list for the
Lamont Library (60,000 vol-
umes), or at the most, enough
for Honors research.

As for professional research,
most professors are not expect-
ed ‘to carry on research at
Davidson during the school
year, but are given summer
grants to do their most interest-
ing work elsewhere.

Another reason is the gener-
ally inefficient handling of
library funds by the faculty.
While the total amount of mon-
ey apportioned to a department
is known by all the members of
that department, there is no
system for handling orders and
buying of books is conducted at
a random, rather disorderly
pace; as a result, the total
amount of money assigned to
a department is never used and
a tremendous surplus builds
up.

QUOTAS UNMET

The Thompson Fund Mbrary
money is set up so that it is
catried over to the next year if
it is not used by the faculty: in
the fall of this year approxi-
mately eleven thousand dollars
of unused money had atcumu-
lated over several years due to
the simple fact that the faculty
had not used up its quotas.

A third reason for the small-
ness .of Lhe library is that stu-
dents seem afraid to use the
suggestion box which sits in the
right foyer on the main floor.

Many times I have heard
students curse that they can't
find a certain book in ‘the li-
brary — when all they have to
do, if they really want the book,
is to fill out a slip which is
easily found at the desk and
drop it in the nearby box.

PROZSLEMS

What can be done about this
situation? First of all, it seems
obvious to me that Davidson
needs a large library, perhaps
eventually 400,000 volumes, be-
cause we are located high and
dry here in Mecklenburg Coun-
ty with no other large reference
or resource libraries at our dis-
posal, and the Interlibrary loan
is too slow and costly.

If Davidson were located in
Chapel Hill or Philadelphia
then I would say fine, let’s use
their library for our resource
materials; but it so happens
that Charlotte, a rather Philis-
tine town, is our only close cen-
ter of learning.

Second, faculty research here
on the spot should be encourag-
ed by trying to keep up to date
in various fields: one reason
professors lack enthusiasm for
building an outstanding library.
at Davidson is because they
equate research with summer
grants to some outstanding
library elsewhere, and the poor
old Davidson library is equated
with containing certain basic
information which is meant
only for sophomores and fresh-

HUMAN...WELL
SAY SHE'S

men.
STUDENTS MUST ACT

This lack of interest is one
reason why a surplus like the
above accrues.

Third, and perhaps the best
way that a fine library can be
built here, is for the students
to make up their minds to re-
quest all books they need for
their studies which are not
presently in the library: this
might result in a deficit in
library funds, but, as one aad-
ministrator of the college says,
if you tell the alumni that all
the money for books at David-
son has been used and the stu-
dents are still clamoring for
them, money will come pouring
in like a deluge.

NO JUSTIFICATION

In our situation there is no
justification for the phrase
“small undergraduate library”
— we ought to have all the
worthwhile books we can get
our hands on, even if it means
building another wing on the
library, doubling the library
staff, or whatever.

Perhaps someone on_ the
faculty or administration with
vision and ambition for David-
son will make the library a
private crusade, for it is ridic-
‘ulous for Davidson College to
think she can spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars on
buildings and fraternity houses
and neglect the basic tool of
the student — books — and
still have a fine educational in-
stitution. :

Of course, compared with
Catawba College (60,000 vol-
umes), Davidson (75,000 vol-
umes) has a pretty good library.

LIKE ALL 6000 TEACHERS,
SHE HAS IN HER BEING A
TOUCH OF THE SPIRIT FIRED BY
THE DEDICATION OF HER CALLING!

TOIL AND TROUBLE

Rushing Campaign
Job For Boosters

BY JOHN STONE

Tne honorable gentlemen, the Trustees of Davidson
College, have departed from the campus after many
stormy hours of session. They have enunciated the
policies which Davidson is to follow for at least another
year. Many are in perfect agreement with their actions;
many are not. At present, it does not matter, for nothing
will change until they meet again, if they change then.

This does not mean that those students who
have an honest concern for Davidson College and
its future are to quit working. Let those who will
continue to work for those ideals they hold dear.

But more important, at

least for, the present, is

something that can be undertaken and completed

right now.

The admissions committee has completed the proces-
sing of approximately 150 applications that were found
acceptable —- and how! These boys represent the top
group of applications thus far. These are the boys that
can get into any school in the country, often with a

scholarship.

Davidson normally gets 62% of her applicants
who complete the whole round of application. But
it is not known exactly how many of this top group
we can get. The competition for them is very, very

keen.

It is true that there will be a good many of these
boys who want Davidson because of inheritance or other
such factors. But this group is not big enough by itself.
All these boys have been carefully screened, and they
are the kind Davidson needs.

To get them there must be a concerted effort on the
part of students, as well as the administration. Dean
White has posted lists of these boys in Chambers, and all
fraternity presidents have been mailed a copy.

What now confronts the student is a rushing cam-
paign. Check these lists and if there are boys from
near your home, or boys you know, visit and write
to them. The advantages of having students of this
calibre at Davidson should be immediately obvious.

I don’t know that Davidson needs another organiza-
tion on campus, but unless I am overlooking someone, I
don’t know of an organization that could handle this sort
of thing. Anyone interested in a Davidson Booster’s

Club?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR:

}

Critic Assails Special

Edition Of

Dear Editor,

Perhaps, after two and one-
half years at Davidson, it is
time for a weary Junior to take
quill in hand anad publicly ex-
press an opinion.

Quite amazed and sickened
was | to discover and read
the “Trustee Special” edition
of THE DAVIDSONIAN,
which was distributed Tues
day night.

To my knowledge, with the
single exceptions of the Martin
election and inauguration is-
sues, this is the only “extra”
which I have seen published —
not only was it an “extra,” but
it appeared to me to be a mean
example of propaganda and
pressure politics — directed at
attempting to influence the

Board of Trustees toward a pro-

integration policy.

According to my rough cal-
culations, some 264.5, out of

Newspaper

@ total of 320, column inches
in this edition were devoted
to these materials, ali favor-
ing integration.

I do not wish to enter into
a public debate concerning the
merits or evils of this question;
I was, in fact, glad to read a
more liberal newspaper — my
point is simply that “The News
and Editorial Voice of David-
son College,” which is support-
ed largely through student fees,
should not be so bold as to
thus flagrantly: support views
which do not meet with the ap-
proval of a majority of the stu-
dent body as expressed in a
poll, unscientific as it may
have been.

Especially do 1 not enjoy
seeing our newspaper being
utilized as the lowest form of
propaganada sheet — with or
without student approval.
