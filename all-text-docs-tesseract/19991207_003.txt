services for the resident families as well as an
after school program for students living in the
facilities and for other students in the neighbor-
hood.

“| have written several op-ed pieces on
homelessness and poverty issues and served as a

resource for several studies on homelessness and
public policy as it relates to homelessness, includ-
ing a study by the National Coalition of the Home-
less,” Ninestein said. explaining his interest in
alleviating poverty problems.

Ninestein also described his current work
with United Ministries, which followed after seven
years at Family Shelter. United Ministries is an
extension of the servant ministries of over 100
Greenville congregations, Christian and non-
Christian. The agency's mission is to help those
impoverished to find environments that aid in
positive life changes. “For example,” he said,
“One of our programs is a day shelter for the
homeless.”

During the discussion, Ninestéin told a
memorable story about a resident at Family
Shelter who went on to graduate with honors
from University of South’ Carolina’s Nursing
school and now lives and works independently.
The discussion also turned towards issues of
public policy as it affects homelessness and the
role of corporate America in politics.

For students interested in working with the
homeless on campus, Room in the Inn will be
hosting guests on campus in Davidson College
Presbyterian Church, beginning after the semes-
ter break. Coordinator Lindsay Meyers ’00 can
be contacted for more information.
