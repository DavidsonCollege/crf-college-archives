6 THE DAVIDSONIAN

DCSO, from page 6

the Vidin State Philharmonic in Bulgaria.

Although the Theatre Department’s
“Hamlet” and the
Men’s __ Basketball’s
season opener took
place at similar times
the same night, the at-
tendance at the orches-
tra performance was
quite impressive. By
the end of the concert,
standing ovations filled
the performance hall.

I left the concert completely transforked
into a state of absolute harmony. Luckily, I
was able to have a relaxed conversation with

one of the orchestra members on trumpet,
Jeff Roth ‘12.

“T think it went very well considering the
amount of time we had,” said Roth. “There
was good balance between the soloists and
the orchestra, and
we didn’t drag the
tempo. The con-

The next chance to catch DCSO enseme-

It’s that time again! Another Turkey Day
is just around the corner. As the stuffing,
cranberries and yams are headed out of the
kitchen and heaped onto your plate though,
let us not forget how much we truly have to
be grateful for.

True- it’s easier to be stressed out over
the papers that are still due and the problems
that will still be waiting for us when we re-
turn from break, but what about all those lit-
tle things in life that are so priceless? These
little things are what make life what it is. So
set aside your serving of worry for just a mo-
ment and read over these small things I am
grateful for:

1. Push pin smileys

2. Tuna sandwiches from union

3. Pink shrimp (as opposed to gray)

4, 4 red cars in a row

5. Weird compliments like “you have ex-
cellent motor skills”

6. Figuring out how to label your aim
buddies by their names instead of screen-
names

7. Putting off buying a purchase you re-
ally want only to go back Jater and find it on
sale! (or on recall- 6" sense!)

8. Late-night escapades that are more
than a little questionable- like pretending to
climb Mt. Everest when it’s really a dryer

9. Laughing at...I mean with....your boy-
friend and his best friend when they make a
stupid joke (i.e. every joke)

10. When someone winks at you...and
they look GOOD doing it

11. That one part of your body you can’t
help but be a little proud of- no matter what it
is, eyes, elbows, calves, hair
