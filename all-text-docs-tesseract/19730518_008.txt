By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

pro football experience, the
Davidson alumni team
challenges the 1973 Wildcat
football squad tomorrow at 2
p.m.

Heading the cast of alumni

who will compete in the centest
are Gordon Slade, Mike
Mikolayunas and _ Steve
Heckard.

Slade was the Southern Con-
ference player of the year in
1969 and played in the Coaches
All-America game. He was
drafted by the Baltimore Colts.

Mikolayunas topped the
nation in receiving in 1970. He
also spent some time with the
Colts.

Heckard played in the NFL
with both the Los Angeles
Rams and the New Orleans
Saints.

Acting as coach for the Alum-
ni team will be Mike Kelly, a
1970 graduate. He spent the last
three years with the Cincinnati
Bengals and was recently
traded to the New Orleans
Sajnts. NFL rules prohibit him
from playing in the game.

ticipate in the third annual

a free agent with the Dallas

Cowboys following his
graduation in 1969.
Also suiting up for the Alumni

will be Jimmy Poole, another
past grid star for the Cats. Poole
was an all-conference quar-
terback as well as Southern
Conference player of the year in
the late 1960's.

Basketball coach Terry
Holland will also compete for
the former Davidson men.
Otherwise known as the ‘‘Clin-
ton Flash"’, Holland will be in
uniform for the second straight
year. Last time he played, but
failed to catch a pass.

“I'll do better this time,”
Holland vowed. Kerry Keith, a
1968 graduate, will play, as will
Scotty Shipp. Keith holds the
school record for career
rushing, while Shipp quar-
terbacked the Cats this past
season and was ninth in the
nation in passing.

Other recent Wildcat stars
who will play include Frank
Rader, John Harper, Robert

McCormick.

The game is sponsored by the
Wildcat Club. There will be an

Sandy Carnegie, head of .the
Wildcat Club and coordinator of
the game, announced that Rev.
J. I. Knight, an alumnus from
1922, will serve as honorary
captain and chaplain for the old
grads.

Dr. J. B. Woods, class of 1918,
will be the team doctor.

‘That's fitting,"’ Carnegie
said. ‘‘Over the years he has
treated just about everyone who

will play for the alumni.”’

With a large array of passers,
the alumni will have a very

potent attack on paper. If they
are able to use this weapon ef-
fectively, it should be a strong
test of the coming year's defen-
sive alignment.

The game will be preceded by
a Wildcat Club spring meeting
at 10 a.m. in Perkins
Auditorium. The meeting is
open to the public.

Guest speaker at that
meeting will be Bill Story, a for-
mer Davidson head coach, now
one of the coaches for the alum-
ni.

Fagg Holds
Hopeful View
For Next Year

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

Despite injuries to several
key players, football head
coach Dave Fagg feels that
Davidson can be a, ‘‘dark horse
in the Southern Conference next
year.

“We've already had injuries
to some of the best athletes on
the team,’’ Fagg said.

“Eddie Womack, Walt
Walker, John Webel, Dave
Ingold, Jose Rodriguez and Hal
Paul have not been 100 percent
yet,” he continued.

In light of these injuries,
Fagg cannot afford to be as op-
timistic as he would like to be
concerning the Varsity-Alumni
tilt this Saturday.

‘“‘We might get to use Ingold
and Webel on a limited basis if
we're lucky. The rest of the in-
jured men will probably not
play at all,’’ he stated.

Thus far, Fagg has been par-
ticularly impressed with the
defense in spring practice.

He singled out Tom Fleischer,
Jack Stultz, Jim Deville,
George Weicker, Eddie
Williamson and Danny Ward
for their efforts this spring.

“Overall, I'd say that our
defensive unit looks like our
toughest hitting defensive team
in a long time,"’ said Fagg.

He also noted that Dave Har-
per, Gary Pomeroy, Jim
Hankinson, Frank Shinn and
Mike Harding have all been im-
pressive in spring practice.

Fagg also admitted to being
pleasantly surprised at the im-
provement of kicker Joe Dun-
can since last season.

The team started spring prac-
tice several weeks ago at the
conclusion of the spring sports
schedules.

According to Fagg, the team
started later than most schools
because the coaching staff feels
that if a team member wants to
