Allgood Releases Ride the Bee,
Allman-Influenced Southern Rock

By Chip Petree

Recently, the popular music
scene has seen the reemergence of
old names and the creation of new
powerhouses while growing more
andmore diverse. Michael Jackson
returns with his new album, Dan-
gerous, in which the pop icon
studies the question of “Black or
White” (by the way Mike, are you
asking yourself?). Hammer (with-
out the M.C.) has become “2 Legit
2 Quit” , as well as a new Falcons
fan. And finally, rising from the
heavy metal. wake left by Metal-
lica and G’n’R’s new albums,
Seattle has recently given the world
Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nir-
vana. The latest band to come out
of an earlier music farm known as
Athens, Georgia is Allgood.

Known until recently as
Allgood Music Company, the good
ole’ boys with the southern drawls
shortened their name with the re-
lease of their first CD. Just as
fellow Athens bands R.E.M. and
Widespread Panic, Allgood’s first
release comes out ona minor label
¢ the band’s sown,» Meccabitch
Records), and it features the band’s

Movie Review:

unique southern funkadelic sound.
Ride the Bee opens with “Funky
House”, perhaps the band’s most
widely known song, and definitely
the calling cry for the band’s musi-
cal style. After another traditional
Allgood single (“Chore Boy”), the
band eases into its epic, “Sem-
prini” followed by “Spiny Nor-
an’. These two tunes are almost
always played live back to back,
and they comprise fifteen minutes
of the album. During these songs
that the strengths of the band shine
through.
Bassist Mike Sain is as solid as
they come, and he is joined by
drummer Charlie Pruet in one of

the brightest rhythm sections

around. On top of this foundation
the Allman-like (yes, that is where
the name comes from) Clay Fuller
and John Carter lay down thier
guitar work in intertwined harmo-
nies that are truly reminiscent of
Dickey and Duane.

The disc continues with “Train
Song”, acheesy, acoustical throw-
back to the Allmans. The last half
of the album.includes “Overload”’,

a jammin’ tune with funk founda-

tions and blues overlays, and the
title track, an instrumental roller
coaster ride. The album concludes
with “Trilogy”, a ten-minute trib-
ute to the Allman Brothers’ south-
ern sound and feel.
Thecontributions of guestkey-
boardist Chuck Leavell, who
played with the Allmans’, stand
out in this song as adequate imper-
sonations of Gregg Allman.
Though this is the best track on the
album, I was disturbed to hear that
they cut off the faster, bluegrass-
style jam that usually extends the
song.
Overall, I would strongly en-
courage anyone to order this al-
bum. The address is below, and the

cost is only $13 for a CD. Hon-”’

estly, I feel that the album isa little
overproduced and some of the jams
aré cut short, but that just serves to
make their live sound more of a
treat. Ride the Bee is worth the
money and the wait. Check it out.

The Hand That Rocks the C radle
Proves a Successful New Thriller

By Scott McLean

When I went to see The Hand
that Rocks the Cradle. as a sneak
preview flick, I could not believe
that it was being shown in con-
junction with a film like Beauty
and the Beast. This one is a far cry
from typical Disney films, includ-
ing one of their other. holiday
releases Father of the Bride, but I
guess it was only a matter of time
before the family movie giant
jumped into the thriller genre with
both feet.

Called by many a Fatal At-
traction wanna-be, this one does
manage to hold its own thanks to
an excellent cast and a particularly
chilling script.

Annabella Sciorra Jungle Fe-
ver) plays Claire Bartel, a happy
homemaker who is anxiously
awaiting the birth of her second
child with her husband Michael
and her five year old daughter
Emma.

Claire goes to'see a new gyne-
cologist for her checkup and in a
somewhat disturbing scene he
molests her during her examina-
tion. A distraught Claire’ files
charges against the doctor, who
subsequently commits suicide
because of the scandal.

Six months later Claire has
given birth to baby Joe and is look-

ing for a nanny to watch the kids
while she starts her new herb busi-
ness in the backyard (kind ofcorny,
don’t you think?). Enter Peyton
Flanders (Rebecca de Mornay,
Tom Cruise’s prostitute/girlfriend
in Risky Business), who seems the
perfect candidate.

Unknown to Claire and com-
pany is the fact that the new nanny
is the widow of the same molesting
physician. To add to the plot, she
had a miscarriage due to the trauma
caused by her husband’s death,
and she blames Claire for all her
misfortune. While wowing them
with her looks and her charm, she
sets about the task of taking over
the family as herown. De Mornay
has a field day with this role, and it
is devilishly delightful to watch

"her set the family against one an-

other and attempt to seduce Mi-
chael. This girl is one slick cookie.

Not everyone, however, is
taken in by Peyton. Claire’s friend
Marlene warns her “never to let an

-attractive woman take a power

position in your home,” but obvi-
ously Claire can’t take a hint to

‘save her life. And dear, sweet

Peyton offers few hints as to her
true intentions. .

When the mintayd disabled
handyman Solomon (Ernie

Hudson, the fourth Ghostbuster)

catches her breast feeding the baby
herself, she gets him fired in a
particulary viscious way.

Peyton is a home-wrecking,
husband-stealing, bunny-boiling
psychotic nanny from hell -- and
those are some of her better quali-

ties. I was just awed by De Mor- |

nay’s Peyton; no matter how awful
she is.or what she does, she de-
mands admiration because of her
ability to achieve her objectives
without getting caught. Forget
about being a nanny, this girl
should’ ve put in her resume at the
CIA.

Having been drawn in by the
catchy trailers for this filfn, I went
into the theater a little apprehen-
sive about whether or not it would
be any good, and I came out pleas-
antly surprised. The film’s strong
pointis the acting, though itis a bit
Velveeta-ridden at times; addition-
ally, it claims the viewers’ atten-
tion by taking the predictabilities

‘usually associated with this type of

movie and adding twists that make
the story interesting.

This kind of “variation on a
theme” lends the film a spark of
life that definitely keep the audi-
encerapt. Granted this is not Oscar

caliber material, but if you want to .

beentertained The Hand that Rocks
the Cradle more than delivers.

Steven Wright to
Appear at Davidson

By Jim Carswell

This weekend the Union Con-
cert Committee will offer an un-
usual entertainment for all of us
celebrating Davidsonians. Instead
of driving to:‘Charlotte for some
expensive dinner with your Mid-
winters date, stick around here so
you can catch Steven Wright, a
stand-up comedian with a wildly
popular live act and a very suc-
cessful HBO special. He’sso good
that he’s even won an Academy
Award for his work ona short film
called “The Appointments of
Dennis Jennings.”

Here’s a sample of his wit (if
you haven’t seen the video that’s
been showing in the Union the past
week): “I went to a place to eat. It
said, BREAKFAST ANYTIME,

, so I ordered French toast during

the Renaissance.”

This “story” reveals an amaz-
ing ability to see the world in the
strangest of terms, and combined

‘with his deadpan delivery, that

vision keeps audiences laughing.

And we are getting him here
rightata high pointin his ten-year-
old career. He has said that he felt
a desire to do comedy all of his
childhood, and finally gave into
that feeling with an open-mike
appearance at a club in Boston
back in 1982. He had recently

graduated from Emerson College
there and was working odd jobs.
His firstjoke: “I was ina bookstore
and I started talking to a French-
looking girl. She was a bilingual
illiterate. She couldn’t read in two
different languages.”

The act succeeded. “I was
scared outof my mind and just said
this stuff I had memorized in my
apartment,” he says, and when the
audience laughed, “What an
amaaaaaaazing rush!” That appear-
ance led to a regular gig, and then
Johnny Carson’s talent agent saw
him and booked him for “The
Tonight Show.”

Back-to-back appearances
there assured him of success. More
television popularized hisclub act,
which has continued to make audi-
ences laugh‘across the country.
There has also been an album and
several movie appearances, in
addition to the awards.

His career continues to move
along without a hitch, and it pulls
into Davidson this weekend.
Whether you have seen him before
or not, the show, which he says
consists of only “‘a funny pack of
lies,” promises to entertain.

Get tickets soon, because they
are going fast. They are on sale at
the Union ticket office 2 to 5 p.m.
every day this week.
