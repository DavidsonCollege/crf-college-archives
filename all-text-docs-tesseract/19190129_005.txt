C. F. Allen, ex-’19, of Columbia The-

son entering the classic halls of old Da-

D. Ralph Freeman, ex-'20, is with the
American troops in France. His address

Chaplain) Ben Lacy—"The Fighting
Parson.”

The following incident was recently
published in ‘The News and Observer.
It is part of a letter from Lieut. 5. M.
Gattis, Jr.. telling of the bravery of
Chaplain Ben Lacy, ‘06, under fire, and
how Chaplain Lacy received the title
“The Fighting Parson.” The — lines
quoted are as follows:

“Ben Lacy has been dubbed “The
Fighting Parson.’ ‘he other day when
Fritz's batteries were extremely naughty
he took a reel of wire, a telephone and
a telescope and crawled out to a high hill
between the lines and from there direct-
ed the fire of our batteries. He did this
for three days hand running and we de-
molished several enemy batteries, put
their roads practically out of commission
and every time a Boche came into view
Parson Lacy poured it into them, One
particular instance is worth mentioning.
He caught sight of a building that look-
ed like a barracks way back of the line.
He telephoned back its exact position,
being one of the most skilled artillery
officers in the outfit, and ordered con-
centrated fire on it, all guns firing at the
same time. ..When the twelve guns
spoke, the building collapsed. ‘Then the
parson -scattered his fire and took them
from all sides as they poured out of the
building. ‘There were several connected
on to the telephone with him, ‘and all
swear he said: ‘Give ‘em hell.’ He
swears he didn't.”

Chaplain B. R. Lacy finished at Da-
vidson in 1906. He stood prominent
in athletics, oratory, and the class room.
He played on the Varsity baseball team
and was quarterback on the — football
team, and was known familiarly as
‘Ben.’ In his Sophomore year he was
class president, and in his Senior year
took honors by winning the Senior Ora-
tor’s medal. After graduating Mr. Lacy
won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.
England. Coming back to America, he
entered Union Theological Seminary,
and here again distinguished himself by
winning the Hoge Fellowship, the high-
est honor given at this Seminary.

«Mr. Lacy enlisted: as chaplain when
America entered the war, and has now
been overseas several months. At the
alumni banquet last May 27 Chaplain
Lacy was unanimously elected vice-presi-
dent of the Davidson Alumni Associa-
tion.

turn up everywhere and it always dues
one so much good to come across them,

day morning. By ‘here’ | mean our So-
cial Center. It is two Sundays old, and
1 conducted cach time. But next meet-
