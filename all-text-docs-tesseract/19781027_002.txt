pa ricipat ion in new WDAV

(Continued from page 1)

Roberts stressed her desire to

have students participate in _

WDAV, “saying, ““We ‘hope to
provide more opportunities
than ever before for students to
work at the station and. gain
valuable experience by..so do-
ing. I am setting aside portions
of the broadcast day as student
volunteer hours and as paid
staff hours. Student hours
would be identified as such on
the air,’ ”

According to Director of Per-
sonnel and Administrative Ser-
vices Robert Stephenson, : Da-
vidson student4°who work for
WDAV will probably receive
the same wages as other stu-
dent employees by a long
standing College policy of pa-
ying all students the same
wage. ‘To pay some students at
a higher rate of pay could create
a condition that would be unfair
to the other working students, si
he said.

Roberts said that the new
WDAV control board is ex-
pected to arrive on or slightly
after November 6. She hopes
the station will be able to
resume broadcasting around
November 20, to.give the new
staff time to become accus-
tomed to station equipment and

begin on December 5.

Some question has arisen
whether classical programming
by WDAV will provide a public
service to the Charlotte area in
light of the programming of
WPVR-Rock Hill and WFAE
-Charlotte. WPVR is part of the

“south Carolina Edueational Ra-

dio Network. Its signal can be
picked up well ‘in the Charlotte
area. WFAE is the radio station
of UNC-Charlotte and is opera-
ted by that school’s Student
Broadcasting Association.
WFAE will increase its wat-
tage around June, 1979 to
100,000, which will enable it to
cover ‘Charlotte and a large
section of the Carolina Pied-

mont with its signal. WFAE |

intends to become a National
Public Radio Station in 1980,
which means that it will receive
federal funding. Roberts main-
tains, ‘‘Rock Hill is primarily an
educational station which
broadcasts some classical music
at night.

We have no idea what the
nature of WFAE’s program-
ming will be after they increase
power to 100,000 watts and
become a National Public Radio
Station, but it seems logical
that they will be primarily a
public affairs station..Our clas-
sical programming will definite-
ly fill a vacuum.”

Spencer told The Davidso-
nian last week that he also

expects WFAE will program
primaily public affairs.

In contrast, Chris Wright,
Program Director for WFAE
told The Davidsonian Wednes-
day, ‘‘WFAE presently. broad-
casts: 50 hours of classical music
a week. After the move to
100,000 watts, 20 to 30 hours
will probably be added to this
total. Our status as a National
Public Radio Station will proba-

-bly not. affect the amount of

classical music we broadcast.
“Dr. Spencer appeats to be

under the misguidance that
-béing a NPR station means that
“we will have to concentrate our
-programming in education or

public affairs:
“This is not true. We intend

: to retain fine arts broadcasting

as our primary focus, playing a
great deal-of classical and jazz.”

“He also added that: ‘Davidson

has not contacted us about our

Reese, said W. broad-
casts ‘‘a total of 45 hours of
classical music per week during
the school year and 60 to. 65
hours during school holidays
and vacations.”’

The Davidson chapter of the
North Carolina Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG) re-
ceived permission to participate
Tuesday in a hearing to be held
this winter concerning the
transportation of nuclear
wastes to McGuire Nuclear
Station.
Duke Power Company is

‘looking for approval to trans-

port nuclear waste from its
disposal plant in Oconee, S.C.,
to McGuire ten miles south of
Davidson on_N.C. highway 73.
The company hopes to move
three truckloads a day, begin-
ning in March, on a route
through, among other places,
Clemson, S.C., Greenville, S.C.
and Cornelius, N.C.

The route also involves the
intersection of Interstates 77

and 85, which has been the site
of nine truck overturns in the
past two years.

Plans are hinging on approval
by the Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board (ASLB), which
is presently in the process of
scheduling hearings on the mat-
ter.

At-a hearing Tuesday, ASLB
hearing board chairman Robert
Lazo decided to allow Davidson
PIRG to be present at the
hearings.

Procedural technicalities are
still being worked out to deter-
mine the parties which will be
present at the ASLB discussion
and the exact date of the
hearing.

Davidson P*RG President
Chuck Gaddy says he expects
the hearing to take place some-
time in December.

Gaddy also commented that

the March deadline for begin-
ning the tentative shipments
could possibly be pushed back
because of environmental lob-
byists arguing against trans-
port of the nuclear material,
among whom is PIRG. These
lobbyists stress the danger of
leakage in the event of an
accident.

Gaddy said Duke's view is
that ‘‘there are no hazards
involved.”

PIRG sent a letter earlier this

bute to debates on the matter of

nuclear waste transport.
