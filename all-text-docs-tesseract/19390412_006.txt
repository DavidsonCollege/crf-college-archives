Masons Laud
Former Grad

Dr. M. C. S. Noble, ’79, Kenan
professor emeritus of education in
the University of North Carolina,
who celebrated his 84th birthday
recently, was honored by a special
meeting of the University lodge of
Masons Monday evening, April 3.

The principal address was deliv-
ered by Dr. Hubert Poteat of Wake
Forest college, past grand master
of Masons. Several members of the

Grand Lodge of North Carolina
were in attendance.

Dr. W. E. Caldwell, ‘master of
the University Masons said that

the meeting was held for the pur-
pose of paying tribute to Dr. Noble

as a “faithful and _— -distinguished
Mason.”
Dr. Noble became a member of

the Bingham lodge in Mebane 62
years ago and joined the lodge in
Chapel Hill 38 years ago. He was
twice master of the local lodge.

The club has planned to have sev-

eral well-known business and pro-
fessional men speak to the student
body about chgosing their life

Professor H. E. Fulcher present-
ed an interesting talk on the future
of science, and the opportunities
of the youth of today in it; Dr. A.

its needs, in an entertaining man-
ner. Talks on law, medicine, social

its scene laid in the west seem ‘to
indicate that this is a typical

of the better pictures of the year.

An adventurous young Irishman
comes to America to fight in the
Civil War, after engaging in’ many
wars over in Europe. After the war
he goes to the Middle West where
civilization was just being estab-
lished and helps* to found Dodge
City. He occupied himself by kill-
ing buffalo and selling the meat
to the men that were building the
railroad to Dodge City. He finds
