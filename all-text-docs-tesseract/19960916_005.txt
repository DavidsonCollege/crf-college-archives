Ernest Jeffries
joins Dean of.
Students staff

ALEX OBERGON
Staff Writer

One of the newest additions
to the Dean of Students office
this semester is Ernest Jeffries.
A Jonesville, S.C. native, he has
joined the Davidson College staff
as Assistant Dean of Students
and Director of Minority Stu-
dent Programs.

Jeffries was educated at the
University of South Carolina,
where he received an under-
graduate degree in Music Edu-
cation, and later his Master’s
degree in Education, concentrat-
ing in College Student Person-
nel Services,

After completing his edu-
cation, Jeffries went on to the
University of Tennessee at Knox-
ville where he took the post of
Residence Life Coordinator. He
then went on to Western Caro-
lina University where he was
Director of Minority Student
Affairs, and assistant to the Vice-
Chancellor of Student Develop-
ment.

As assistant Dean of Stu-
dents, some of Jeffries’ respon-
sibilities include being part of
the Judicial Committee and co-
ordinating the Tutorial Program
as well as being a member of
various committees that deal with
issues concerning student life at
Davidson.

As the director of the Mi-
nority Student Programs, he ad-
vises the Black Student Coali-
tion, organizes the Peer-
mentoring and Pre-Orientation
Programs for first-year students,
and does workshops on race re-
lations and diversity for the Resi-
dence Life Staff.

Jeffries was attracted to the
position because he was “im-
pressed with Davidson as an in-
stitution,” and saw the job to be
challenging and beneficial to his
intellectual growth. He believes
he has a lot to offer to Davidson
and its students.

Jeffries has only been a part
of the Davidson community for
three months, but during that
time, has enjoyed the closeness
of the community and the fam-
ily-type atmosphere. Jeffries and
his wife and daughter hope to
remain at Davidson for now and
the near future.

Students will replace graduated seniors on trustee committees

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL .

News Editor

Davidson’s Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) is look-
ing for a few good students.

Two students are needed to
serve as student representatives on
two Trustee Committees, positions
SGA President Warren Buford
calls “the highest level of student
representation.” —

Recently, students serving on
Davidson College Trustee Com-
mittees voiced student concerns
and opinions concerning the for-
mation of Davidson’s new alcohol
policy, plans to create the new Life
Science Building, and the decision
toraise the floorinthe Baker Sports
Complex arena. Currently, one

student representative serves on
five of the Board of Trustees’ seven
Trustee Committees, which include
committees for Institutional Ad-
vancement, Athletic Policy, and
CCRL.

Last year, two student repre-
sentatives on Trustee Committees
were seniors. Now that Missy
Graves, who served on the Admis-
sions. and Financial Aid Commit-
tee, and Katherine Hash, Building
and Grounds student representa-
tive, have graduated, their posi-
tions remain vacant and must be

filled before the next Trustee meet-.

ing on October 3.

“We were given the privilege
[of serving on Trustee Commit-
tees] two years ago,” says Buford.
“We wantall students to have a say

in who represents the student
body.... This is such an important
position that we feel campus-wide
elections would be the best means
toward that goal.”

These campus-wide elections
are scheduled for January to coin-
cide with elections for SGA Presi-
dent and Vice President. In the
meantime, however, replacements
are needed to provide Trustee Com-
mittees with student input this
October. In the interest of continu-
ity, student representatives chosen
by the SGA on September 24 will
also attend Trustee Committee
meetings on February 3.

Buford explains that the posi-
tion involves “meeting for roughly
two hours on October 3 and then
for two hours on February 3. Stu-

dents should expect that a repre-
sentative will actively voice his or
her opinions as well as those of the
student body.”

“If approved [by the Senate],
those two students will be as stu-
dent representatives to the Trustee
Committees. Their tenure will
expire after the February 3 Trustee
meeting,” states Buford.

Students interested in serving
on either the Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid Committee or the
Building and Grounds Committee
must sign up by September 19 in
the Dean of Students’ Office. A
five-member SGA Selection Com-
mittee will interview each candi-
date before nominating one stu-
dent for each committee to the
Senate on September 24.

All students can create
web pages this year

By Brap CHASE
Staff Writer/Web Manager

To the delight of many, and
confusion of some, Information
Technology Services will offer stu-
dents a chance to make their own
personal web pages this fall.

Students who have played

around on Netscape have certainly .

come across quite afew web pages,
varying in content from weather,
news, sports, and almost every
imaginable topic including poli-
tics and homebrewed beer. Soon,
all students will be able to make
their own web page and presence
on the Internet— but not quite yet.

Lydia Lorenzin, Coordinator
of Academic Facilities and Ser-
vices, sums up the process like
this: “Students will create their
HTML documents and save it in
their Pollux accounts. They will
then send a message to a specific
person stating that they realize their

homepage is covered by the Ac-

‘ ceptable Use Policy and Code of

Responsibility. Within a few days,
there will be a link from the Stu-
dent Homepages page.”

Lorenzin continues, “Any
controversy over pages will be re-
ferred to the Dean of Students’
Office and handled through regu-
lar judicial process. Students also
can’t use their pages for commer-
cial endeavors or violate copyright
laws.” aR

By next week, sheets detail-
ing the process of creating a web
page will be available in all of the
computer labs and from the Help
Desk in Chambers.

The main concern among stu-
dents appears to be a lack of knowl-
edge of HTML, or hypertext
markup language, a basic language
of the Internet.

However, Ralph Morehead, a
sophomore, is optimistic about the
whole process. “Sounds good to

You can be just like the library: create your own web page.

me,” he says, “I’d have to learn to
program [HTML] first.”

Matt Pfeiffer and Jessalyn
Salter express similar concerns. “I
don’t know what [webpages] do,
but Id like to learn” Salter says.
Pfeiffer adds, “After I go to a work-
shop I’m all over it.”

Workshops on HTML will be
offered throughout the fall semes-

ter, sointerested students whodon’t
have an understanding of the
Internet or programming should
not worry.

As the dorms are become net-
worked and students are given ac-
cess to Netscape from their dorm
rooms, demand for and use of web
pages is expected to increase dra-
matically.

Hey, freshmen! Be careful on first night down. Don’t act stupid. And don’t eat at Prime
(they have fatback) — go to the Project Life spaghetti dinner at the Outpost.
