THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, MARCH 7, 1994

Thhescar in his arm was raised up

into letters. I squinted for a mo-
ment, trying to make it out. The
word was KID.

My eyes wandered back to his
face. I had been entranced by his
sweet disposition since the first
time we met. He was a handsome
young man; he surely had many
friends.

“Does your arm say ‘kid’?” I
asked innocently.

“Yeah, one of my boys did it
for me. It was my initiation. That
was years ago.”

A sick feeling came over me
as I realized this 16-year-old high
school sophomore was talking
about much more than the “boys”
he went to school with. His “boys”
were the thugs Hollywood made
movies about and talk show hosts
interviewed. I sat silent, not want-
ing to know any more.

was twelve. Started when I was

eleven, though. Got KID on my
arm when I became the leader. Got
boys all over this side of North
Carolina. Don’t know how much
longer I want to do it, though.”

He sat back, calm and col-
lected, as my mind raced. The
irony of the word KID as his initia-
tion struck me. The entrance into
a gang left him anything but a
child. He gave up his childhood to
play with guns and drugs and wear
the colors of the street.

A second _ realization came
upon me. As the twelve-year-old
leader of a gang, he was a mere
puppet. The people he trusted to
become the family he never had
were using him as their pawn; the

police forces could not discipline a
twelve-year-old boy the way they
would discipline a twenty-year-
old man. They were beating the
system in many ways.

I chose my next words care-
fully. “What do you mean, you
don’t know how much longer you
want to do it? It’s not a club you
sign up for.”

“No, it’s not. But I figure the
next kid I have, I’ll be able to move
on.”

Those words sunkin painfully.
With-all-the-devastating teenage
pregnancy problems in our coun-
try, here I was sitting with a young
man who was counting on his next
child to take him away from a life
of crime. It was too much for me.

“You already have achild?” I
asked.

“I did. She died.” The bell
rang then and he got up and left for
class.

I stared at nothing a lot that
day. At twenty, I suddenly felt
childish and naive. The worst thing
I’d probably dealt with on a daily
basis was getting out of bed when
I was still sleepy.

And here, in just a short in-
stant, I met someone who should
have been worrying about proms,
but who had murders to plan, drugs
to deal, and infants to bury. 3

There isn’t any concrete an-
swer to solve problems like these
that are plaguing our streets now.
But if you-ever-get a free hour or
the inclination, please volunteer at
a high school and make some
friends. They could use someone
who is interested in them as more
than a scapegoat.

I enjoyed reading Rosie
Molinary’s article from two weeks
ago, “Ideal Living is Possible,” but
honestly, I can’t agree with her
thesis. I, like her, am an optimist
who tries always to seek the good,
even if this good is hidden under
layers of bad.

Inthis instance, though, I think
she simplifies the issue too much.
(Sheexplained many problems her
old public high school has, such as
murders and guns, and how lucky
we are at Davidson ==

Money is the issue.

is moral and right. In addition,
most students at Davidson are con-

Scientious enough to volunteer in

the community. If we remember
this type of charity and giving spirit
when we graduate, we can make a
difference to many people in the
world. We can try to make things
a little better in the world.

I guess my biggest problem
with Molinary’s argument is that
she fails to analyze why our school
is practically “ideal.” First, most

bad people are? They search for
people who look poor and don’t
dress like the rest of us. Because
our good blue-suited men do such
a great job and have an eye for
spotting riffraff, we rarely even
see the scummy, bad crooks who
try to steal our money.

Thus, Molinary’s statement,
“The concept is achievable” is
false. She says, “We have come
very close to emulating [a perfect
world] here.” Sadly to say, this

pay over $20,000 a year to make it
wonderful. This money provides
us with top professors who probe
our minds, landscapers who disal-
low flowers to die or grass to grow
too high, laundry people who keep
our clothes fresh and clean, and
cooks who prepare our meals.

For the most part, we are con-
tent because we don’t have any-
thing to complain about. The only
way we could remain in the world
Molinary encourages is if we were
students for the

not to be forced to
face these issues.) I
would agree with

rest of our lives
and remained

her up to a point that the typical
Davidson student does not truly
know how brutal, cruel, and poten-
tially dangerous the worldis. Most
of us here are naive, so I under-
stand why Molinary is trying to
make us more aware of the reality
that we may face after graduation.

Molinary calls Davidson
“ideal in many ways” and encour-
ages us to try to recreate this world
once we leave Davidson. I under-
stand her optimism, but I think her
idealism is a bit gullible.

agree that we should take the
values that Davidson encourages,
such as honesty and integrity, and
go out into the world and do what

of the students here come from
affluent families. Second, the ad-
missions staff is careful to weed
out all the hoodlums and crazy
people. For the most part, we are
all pretty normal young adults with
good backgrounds.

Why is our Davidson world
such a nice place? For several
obvious-reasons: We are the good
people. We have the bucks to
provide hired men with Suzuki
jeeps, guns and official-looking
blue suits. These blue-suited men
drive around and look for the bad
people, who are looking to steal
from us, the good people. How do

our blue-suited men know who the :

world could never be achieved
because most crimes, sadness, and
strife stem from economic imbal-
ances that we just don’t have to
face at Davidson. Those who don’t
have money always want it from
those who do. We are just lucky
enough that we don’t have to see
these people on a daily basis.
Unless all the wealth is distributed
equally (which it never will be),
there will constantly be turmoil
and strife in the world.

Though we live in a nice, safe
environment on a pretty campus,
we need to take off our blinders
and realize that our school is won-
derful because we (or our parents)

within the bound-
aries of Davidson. Just think—our
blue-suited men could keep crooks
out of our sight forever.

No, that can’t happen. We
must move on. We can’t hide from
the evil people forever. I am not
advocating that we leave Davidson
with a feeling of paranoia or de-
pression. On the contrary, we
should try to make the world a
better place. We can take our mor-
als and idealism and try to be hon-
est people who positively affect
others.

But we must be aware that our
abundance of financial resources
is the basis for what makes
Davidson a “perfect” world.

Self-interest lies at the core of our political problems.

What he fails to realize is the dis-
satisfaction among the people with
the government that did not pro-
vide a satisfactory standard of liv-
ing for its citizens, and that this
dissatisfaction was intensified with
the disproportional distribution of
wealth between government offi-
cials and the citizens.

Communism did not collapse
because it was a “philosophy of
mediocrity . . . which would be
satisfied if the gap between rich
and poor were narrowed so that
everyone would be poor, and no-
body succeeded,” as Gullan so na-
ively puts it. If communism had
given its citizens a standard of liv-
ing comparable to the modern in-
dustrialized countries, it would still
exist today.

Iam in no way implying that a
revolution is imminent. But the
issue of the poor and the homeless
must be addressed with more au-
thority and monetary support by
the government. The government
does need to teach the poor to

homelessness, but many people
have fallen through the cracks—
they are my focus.

Gullan, unaware, has commu-
nicated that he holds a subjective
view of society. He accommo-
dates his theories to his own stand-

about the gap between rich and

that limit his “freedom.” He iden-
tified homelessness as “this . . .

about.” Does he care that the saxo-
phone player in the subway station

knows nothing about “seasoned
investments”? Probably not. Or
perhaps that man is just too far at
the other end of the gap for Gullan
to see.

Another egocentric is the last
person to whom we should listen
about social remedies. Does self-
interest not already lie at the core
of our political problems?

The question at hand is
whether housing is a human right
or not. I believe that it is. No one
should die from hypothermia just
because it’s cold outside. No one
should have to sleep on a subway
where homeless people are doused
with gasoline and burned to death.
I was at a funeral for a victim of
this kind of “insanity” when I made
the decision to fight for housing
rights. Think about it and make the
decision for yourself.

Rob King
Business as usual z

The business of America is
business.” After reading Bill
Gullan’s article last week entitled
“Teach the poor to bake,” I imme-
diately thought of a quote that I
heard in my public speaking class
last week. Rather than addressing
Gullan’s sensationalistic personal
attack upon Kim Kreiling, I would
like to reflect briefly upon the na-
ture of capitalism in America.

As an economic system, the
efficiency of capitalism is unparal-
leled. Capitalism utilizes a
human’s basic orientation toward
increasing individual_prosperity
and channels it toward increasing
prosperity first at the company
level, and then at the national level.
When the nation as a whole pros-
pers, each individual prospers. On
the surface, sucha view is wonder- ~
ful, but does it reflect reality?

I do not claim to know the
answer to this question. Some
people benefit from a strong
economy; some people still suffer.
Some people are altruistic and give
to charities; some people couldn't
care less. Some people take ad-
vantage of the welfare system;
some people have legitimate need.

Given the complexity of this

situation, I would like to focus
only upon one word—compassion.
Webster’s defines compassion as
“a feeling of deep sympathy and
sorrow for someone struck by mis-
fortune, accompanied by a desire
to alleviate the suffering.” Even
though Gultan’s title suggests a
constructive approach to helping
the poor, he never really talks about
it, which leads me to believe that
he doesn’t really have “a desire to
alleviate the suffering” of those
with less prosperity than himself.
Very few humans can have this
desire on a continual basis.
This sluggishness to help others,
which I’m sure we have all experi-
enced, is the greatest fault of capi-
talism. Even when I have extra
money, do I necessarily use it to
help others who have legitimate
need? If I am being honest, my
response is no, not necessarily.

So, from where does such
compassion come? I am sure that
Gullan would agree that it does not
come from government. Along
with other religious traditions,
Christianity places an emphasis
upon having compassion for other
people. For this reason, Christian
churches in this country spend
many hours and dollars helping
the poor. Christianity should, thus,

serve as the moral conscience of

America. The problem with sucha
statement is that not everyone in
America isa Christian, and most of
the Christians are inconsistent in
applying principles of compassion
to their everyday lives.

This being the case, I would
like to close with a quote by Martin
Luther King, Jr., which reflects the
necessity of some government in-
tervention. “It may be true that
morality cannot be legislated, but.
behavior can be regulated. The
law may not change the heart, but
it can restrain the heartless.”

Only through such a “med-
dling government” will we be able
to say that the real business of
America is compassion.
