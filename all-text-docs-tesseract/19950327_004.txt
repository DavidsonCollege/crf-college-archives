Molinek named Volunteer Firefighter of the Year

After only two years of service, the Little librarian’ S rep catches fire

By Patricia EvANs
Staff writer

Walking into the library or
watching a firetruck as it heads
down the hill, you will see the
Davidson area’s Volunteer

Firefighter of the Year for 1994.
Frank Molinek was recently
voted Volunteer of the Year by his
colleagues after less than two years
of service.
Molinek answers almost ev-

ery call 24 hours a day and keeps
his firefighting gear in his car at all
times. One third of the calls that
the fire department and Molinek
receive come from right here on
campus.

Molinek adds to the spirit of
community and volunteerism that
sparked his moving to Davidson
and joining the Davidson College
Library staff.

Satisfying a childhood dream,

Molinek feels like he is giving

back to the community.

The same spirit of community
and public service pervades the
library’s staff. The staff shares
public service duties for the com-
munity and the campus despite job
title or position.

Community spirit is what per-
meates Frank Molinek’s decisions
to work at Davidson and to volun-
teer his time to fight fires. “Ser-
vice is part of what we are here
for,” he says.

Harrassment of

international students
proves to be minimal

By JENNIFER KERNS
Staff writer

Last semester, rumors flew
around campus that international
students were being harassed. In
response, a student wrote a letter to
the editor expressing her disap-
proval. Saad Gul, the International
representative of SGA, responded
in writing that internationals had
not been harassed.

Consequently, Saad Gul and

the International Student Associa-
tion (ISA) conducted a study to
determine the extent of the alleged
harassment. March 14, Gul pre-
sented his results to the SGA.
“There were several incidents
reported, but only one was fairly
serious and involved voice mail
messages. The four others were
relatively minor,” Gul says.
Berna Demiralp, President of
ISA, agrees. “The incidents were
scattered. . . but not major. They

are only an unfortunate part of life.

“The incidents were individual
and personal. We must be aware
of them. . . If there are any harass-
ment problems in the future, we
can see the background here, and
then deal with them.” 4

Gul closes by saying that the
majority of students have been very
cooperative with the international
students. “I want to stress that
most Davidson students have been ,
very nice about it.”

Weaknesses in the System

The committee found that, for
the most part, students and faculty
alike are pleased with the Honor
Code and think it is extremely im-
portant to keep it alive at Davidson.
However, there are areas of com-
mon concern and confusion.

First of all, there seems to be
growing concern about petty theft.
People are becoming a bit more
careful about taking care of their
personal belongings.

Secondly, there seems to be
disagreement over whether or not
Honor Code violation punishments
are too strict or too lenient.

A third fear common to both
students and faculty is that stu-
dents aren’t turning each other in
because of close friendships, fra-
ternity and eating house alle-
giances, or team loyalties.

However, this fear can be par-

-tially discredited. According to
the Dean of Students Office, stu-
dents turn in violators as often as
faculty members.

Another important weakness
of the Honor System which the
committee found is that its pres-
enceis not feltstrongly oncampus.
One reason for this apparent lack
of presence is that since almost
every honor trial is closed, stu-
dents are unaware of what the
Honor Council is doing or even
that a violation has occurred.

The committee deliberated
and came up with several recom-
mendations to improve the system
as it exists.

Recommendations

Gaston feels that one of the
most important suggestions is to
improve the presentation of the
Honor Code at freshmen orienta-
tion by making it more ceremoni-
ous and by having smaller discus-
sion groups. He feels that the weak-
nesses of the system are not intrin-
sic but are primarily the result of a
lack of awareness among both stu-
dents and professors.

Buford agrees. He says, “All
of the recommendations are geared
towards making students more

aware of the system.”

The two committee co-chairs
say that faculty members, espe-
cially new ones, should have an
orientation to the system.

There is strong support for the
recommendation that The
Davidsonian publish a list ‘of all
violations and sanctions (names
withheld) at the end of each semes-
ter. This way, the anonymity of
students involved will be protected,
but students will be made more
aware of the activities of the Honor
Council and reminded of the seri-

ousness of the Honor Code.
The Follow-Up

None of the suggestions of the
ad hoc committee are in any way
binding to the Dean of Students
Office or the Honor Council, but
Buford stated at the meeting, “We
spent five months working hard on
this, and we hope they’ Il take our
recommendations into consider-
ation.” \

Ina few weeks,.a new admin-
istration will take the helm of the
Honor Council. Until that time, it
is difficult to predict what, if any,

reforms will take place.

“T don’t think that the incom-
ing chairperson can avoid seeing
this report as important,” said
Buford.

The work of the ad hoc com-
mittee is done, but comments and
suggestions are needed if changes
are to take place.

Interested students can pick
up a copy of the committee’s re- —
port at the Union desk and are
encouraged to express their re-
sponses to members of the ad hoc
committee.
