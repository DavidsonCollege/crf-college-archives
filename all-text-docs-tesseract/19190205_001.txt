Short Sketches of Davidson Men Who Gave Their All

S. C. Hart
8. C. Hart. “12. of Mr Ulla, N.C.

was one of those quiet men “liked best
by those who know them best.” whic al-
ways indicates reserve strength and = po-
tential power. Hart. aside from. ta’:
ing an interest in social matters, was an
ardent supporter of class ivotball. He
also did his full) share in’ helping the
Scrub tootball team. On the ¢8th of
November the report came in that’ Hart
had been killed in action during the
American offensive in’ Octyber.

R. D. Cranford

That part of the casualty list that
probably causes the niost anxiety uf all
is that list of names which are reported—
“missing.” R. D. Cranford, ex-"19, of
Davidson, N. C., is included among this
number. Reed was in college but two
Nears, but in that dme formed many
close friendships among the tellows. He
was a oman of unusual musical ability
and was a mainstay of the Glee Club
while here.

Since being in France Cranford seemed
to have realized most vividly the war
aims of the Allies, and was able to ex-
press himself so realistically that the
New York papers published several of
dis letters as containing an unusually
clear statement of swhat we were striv-
ing .to bring about in the war. He is
remembered fondly by all the people of
Davidson and many of the students of
the upper classes, all of whom regret to
hear that he is still missing: and look for-
ward yet to the faint gleam of hope that
he is still safe.

Lieut. Frank Thompson

Once more we have proof, that some
of the best fighters are produced in the
college athlete.  Liedit. Frank “Thomp-
son, ox-'08. of Raleigh, N. C.. attended
Davidson only one year; but in that
short time made many warm friends
here ‘and left a record of which he could
justly be proud. “Bull” was a born
athlete and was a strong factor both on
the gridiron and diamond, winning his
“D" in both football and baseball his
first year.

After leaving Davidson Thompson
was head coach of football and baseball
at A. & E., and later filled the same
position for two years at Wake Forest,
being extremely popular at both colleges.

The  Davidsonian — gratefully
wishes to acknowledge a gift of one
hundred dollars (S100) from one
of Davidson’s most loyal alumni.
At the donor's request, we do not

* publish his name. but this generos-
ity goes to show that Davidson
spirit and loyalty is often more sub-

stantial than mere sentiment.
