Davidson, with a strong
showing in the field events,
chalked up 43 points to fin-
ish a surprising second in
the Davidson Relays here

Saturday.
Cumberland College took first

place with 59 points. Pembroke
was third with 31 points, Ca-
tawba fourth with 28, and Wof-
ford fifth with 27,

Cumberland had only one first
place, in the triple jump. but
had five seconds and two thirds.
Many of these came in the re-
lays, where points are more
liberally distributed. Davidson
had five firsts, all but one in
the field events.

Tony Orsbon broke the school
record in the high jump with a
leap of 6'4°°. Greg Cox won the
broad jump with a 227%" per-
formance. Wayne Huckel threw
the javelin 191°74%4"", and Dave
Fagg hurled the discus 142’.
Both placed first. The Davidson
sprint medley relay team also
won with a time of 3:36.8 min-
utes.

WHITTLE PLEASED

Head Coach Heath Whittle was
pleased with the results. ‘'I was
surprised at our finishing sec:
ond. I had thought we would be
down around fourth or fifth,” he
said.

“The field men really came
through, especially Orsbon, who
had never high jumped before
this year. We might have given
money, if we had had more
men.”

“We only entered two relays
which virtually eliminated us

“Next year we are going to

added. ‘We are going to add a

FACE THE CITADEL

Davidson will journey to
Charleston Saturday to face The
Citadel in the last dual meet of
the year for the ‘Cats.

“They are a little stronger
than we are,’ said Whittle, “but
we will double up a lot and
should make the meet close.’

On May 5-6 the cindermen will
be in Durham for the State meet
and the next week will go to
Fort Eustes. Va.. for the South

‘Cats Race To Surprising Second Place

Tennis Team Adds 4 Victories
To Place Season Wins At 14

By DON SEWELL
Assistant Sports Editor

Davidson's strong tennis
team added three more wins
to their record by downing
VMI, Richmond, and Appa-
Jachian last week. The vic-
tories stretched the Wildcat
mark to 14-4 for the season
and increased the possibil-
ity of another 20-victory sea-

The frosh linksmen closed out
their season Monday at Cedar-
wood Golf Club in Charlotte,
falling to South Mecklenburg
High School, 9%-5%. and tying
Gastonia Ashley, 742-7%.

The three-way match left the
"Kitten clubmen with a 1-4-1 rec-
ord for the season.

Bill Trumball of South Meck-
lenburg and Steve Gillen of Ash-
ley were co-medalists for the
match with scores of 73. Danny
White was low for the Davidson
linksters with a 74.

Number two man for the 'Kit-
tens, White, featured an eagle
in his round. White won 3%
points while losing 24%. Number
three man Steve Klein had a 77
to take 3% points out of a pos-
sible six. Number five man Ed
Terry fired an 80 to split with
both his opponents, taking three
points and losing three. Number
one man Tom Hart slumped to
an 82 but managed to pick up

son for a Davidson tennis
team.

The win over VMI came on
the Keydets’ courts in Lexing-
ton, Va.. last Thursday. The
Wildcats brought in the victory
with a 9-0 shutout, winning év-
ery singles and doubles match.

Coach Harry Fogleman com-
mented that it is hard to say
how his netmen did against VMI

two points. Number four man
Bob Wrenn fired an 85 and man-
aged to pick ‘up one point.

The match ends the season
for the ‘Kitten linksters. ‘The
boys did not win but one match
but I feel we had a very suc-
cessful season,’’ said Coach Tom
Scott. “There are several] boys
on the team who will help the
varsity a great deal next year.”

Basemen Dump Kings

The frosh baseballers whipped
Kings College, 5-1. Friday at
Highland Park in Charlotte be-
hind the pitching of Johnny
Riggs for their third straight
victory.

Powerful hitting was the key
to the victory as the ‘Kittens
amassed 12 hits in the game, in-
cluding three by Riggs. Mike
Kelly, Cliff Patterson, Lynn
Himes, and Gordon Slade all
knocked in runs, The team com-
mitted only one error in playing

}

because the competition was so
weak.

In a match the next day, also
at Lexington, Davidson garnered
another conference victory by
blanking Richmond by a 9-0
score. Again, Fogleman pointed
out, the reason for the impres-
sive Wildcat victory was the ab-
sence of strong competition from
the Spiders.

its finest defensive game of the
year.

The day before the batmen
played host to Carolina Military
Academy. The ‘Kittens collected
only four hits to seven for CMA,
but they managed to eke out a
3-2 victory. Clark Nickerson ef-
fectively spread out the Cadet
hits to gain his second victory
of the season. The outfield made
several key defensive plays to
make the win possible

The baseballers started their
present string of victories April
14 by downing Kings College,
2-0, behind Riggs’ five-hit shut-
out. Gordon Slade knocked in
the only runs of the game.

The strong pitching of Riggs
(2-1) and Nickerson (2-0) was
credited for the current upsurge
of baseball success by Coach
Sergeant Paul Poteat. The team
currently is sporting a 4-2-1 rec-
ord with one game left on the
schedule.

The third of the fuzzballers’
wins came over Appalachian in
a match in Boone, N. C. Tues-
day. This time the ‘Cats won by
a 5-3 margin. But in this match
only four of the first six mem-
bers of Davidson’s squad were
able to play.

The three easy matches came
as a welcome respite for the

Wildcats who are playing their.

toughest overall schedule in
years. According to Fogleman,
this year's slate, including such
powers as Northwestern, South
Carolina and others. has been a
very demanding one of his
squad.

“We have been able to do
really well. This has been by
far our toughest schedule. We
can win the rest of our matches
this season,"’ addded Fogleman.

Singled out for praise in the
team's powerful showing were
Pinky Hatcher and Peter Par-
rot. Both players experienced
slumps in their singles play, but
have come back strong to help
the team to the last several vic-
tories.

Parrot, along with Geordie
Mueller and Dave Jennings. is
undefeated in singles competi-
tion in Southern Conference
matches this year. Two doubles
teams are also undefeated in
conference play. The duoes of
Mueller-Jennings and Esmond
Phelps-Dan Hearon have yet to
lose in the conference.

Fogleman attributed the suc-
cess in doubles to a more ag-
gressive style of play. “I am
satisfied with .the team’s play
and we hope to retain the con-
ference championship we won
last year,”’ he concluded.

HEAVY SAILING

Heavy air sailing was the or
der of the day, putting the coast
al schools to a distinct advan
tage because of their familiar
ity with the brisk wirids along
the Atlantic coast.

The morning races soon indi-
cated that the outcome of the
regatta would depend upon the
performances of Davidson and
The Citadel. This became more
evident in the afternoon races
as Davidson and The Citadel

| continued to outdistance the oth

er competitors.

The Davidson skippers in the
tough competition included Tom
Kirtley and Chip Robertson in
A Division. Jim Lee and Tad
Lowdermilk in B Division.

EACH tN TWO RACES

In order to spread out the par.
ticipation, each Davidson skip
per entered two races. Witt

Citadel, emerged as high. point
skipper of the day with one first
and three seconds. Lowdermilk
was high point skipper for Da-

Lowdermilk placed first in both
his races. In the second of these
faces. Lowdermilk protested
Lane Sikes of The Citadel for

The final scores before the

Football Starters

Excused:

Smith

“We encourage Davidson students to participate in

sports,” head football coach Homer Smith told
SONIAN this week. “One of the strong sell

ing points Of our recruiting program is the coordination
of football with spring sports.”

Smith made these statements
following charges that his staff
has coerced football players who
were participating in spring
sports to go out for spring grid
training.

Several students had indicat-
ed they had been approached by
the football coaches and advised
to quit a spring athletic team

and attend football practice. In.

an issue earlier this year. THE
DAVIDSONIAN reported that
Smith said he would excuse
scoring members of a spring
sport from football drills.

Finally, a slarter on a spring
sport team has asked to quit
and come out for spring foot-
ball. The boy was subsequently
injured and may be unable to
work out for the rest of this
term.

Smith, however. indicated that
his position had been misrepre-
sented, and that the policy of
his department would be to ex-
cuse only established grid start-
ers who were helping a spring
sport.

The head coach noted that
Tommy Caldwell and Dick Lind-
sey. established starters on the
football team, have been excus
ed from workouts. Lindsey plays
baseball and Caldwell partici-
pated in track.

Several other gridders attend
workouts and also participate in
spring sports contests.

Smith decides who is an es:
tablished starter.

In reference to the injured
player. Smith said the accident
was a freak mishap that could
not have been foreseen. After
the injury, Smith let another
player he had requested leave

sport to compensate for the loss

Pair Of Tilts With Furman

Lady Luck continued to
evade the Davidson baseball
team as they fell to Furman
twice at Greenville, S. C.,
last Saturday, 8-1 and 9-0.

The ‘Cats played much-im-
proved baseball in the field, but
again the bats could not get
warmed up. Buddy Durham was
tagged with the loss in the first
game, with Mackey Reavis be-
ing the victim in the second.

The ‘Cats lost the services of
catcher Hank Strickland who
was required to go to a football
practice where he suffered a
broken foot. Jack Smith got the
chance to catch for the first
time in his life and did what
Coach Tom Stevens called ‘‘a
real good job.”

Smith had two hits in the first
game and one in the second.
David King also had a hit in the
first game. The second game
saw Stew Brown, Dick Lindsey,
Claude Owen, and King get safe-
ties along with Smith. Frank
Murphy played second base for
the 'Cafs in the absence of Skip
Waite and did a job with which
Stevens was quite pleased.

GEORGIA SOUTHERN WINS

Georgia Southern came to Da-
vidson Tuesday for a_ single
game for which the ‘Cats seem-
ed to be fired up. They got off
to a 3-0 lead, the big blow being

FIVE HITS

In the game, the ‘Cats scratch-
ed four other hits to go with
Waite's blast. Smith continued
on his streak with two hits, and
Brown and King got one each.
Every member of the 12-man
squad saw action. as the team
played well afield against what
may be the best team they face.

Team batting leaders going
into Saturday's conference dou-
bleheader here with The Cita-
del’s Bulldogs are Brown, with
a .232 average and seven RBI's;
Smith, with a .214 average and
four RBI's; Owen. with a .200
average and four RBI's: and
Waite, with a .196 average and
six RBI's.

Dave King has been hitting
consistently for the last few
games and seems determined to
finish strong, as do Lindsey, Ray
Logan, and Murphy.

Pitching for Davidson tomor-
row in the first game. which
begins at 1:30 p.m., will be Bud-
dy -Durham. The second game
will see Elliott on the hill for
Davidson. Both Durham, with

an ERA of 4.29, and Elliott. with
an ERA of 3.74, hope to move
the team ahead of the Bulldogs
with victories.

Thursday saw the Wildkittens
close out their schedule with a
3-2 victory over a tough Gard-
ner-Webb team to whom they
lost earlier. ‘‘Lefty’’ Clark Nick-
erson won his third game in as
many starts in hurling the team
to their fifth win against two
losses and one tie. Gordon Slade
struck the big blow for the ‘Kit-
tens with a two-run single in the
sixth, which put them ahead to
stay. G-W could manage only
five hits off the crafty Nicker-
son, who had two hits to aid his
own cause.

STEVENS PLEASED

Coach Stevens was quite hap-
py with the frosh this year.
“This is the best freshman team
we've had here in eight or nine
years,"’ Stevens said, ‘‘and. is
the most wins ever posted by a
frosh team. They have several
boys who should be a big help
‘o the varsity next year."

Stevens also said the new
baseball field will be officially
dedicated May 6. The ceremony
will be short and will take place
before the game with Belmont
Abbey at 2 p:m.

“We'd like to have a good
crowd for this game, since the
administration will be officially
present,”’ said Stevens.
