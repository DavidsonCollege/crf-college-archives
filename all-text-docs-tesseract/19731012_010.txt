PRACTICE BRINGS SUCCESS

Women’s Net Team

Has Spring Debut

Last spring College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and
tennis coach Jeff Frank for-
mulated the idea of a Women’s
Tennis Team, because Southern
Conference rules will notpermit
sexually integrated teams. Ms.
Carol Goldsborough, a junior
from Maryland, was recruited
to head the team, coordinating
activities with Frank, to whom
she is responsible.

This fall Goldsborough
organized an elimination tour-
nament for team placement,
although her persona!
evaluation was also a factor in
determining the numbered
positions.

The 7-man team, which has
no substitutes, includes Mary
Lyon (Dee) Booth, Gold-
sborough (captain), Sue
McAvoy, Mary Miller, Ruth
Murphey, Nancy Stanger and
Becca Stimson. Three of the
girls are freshmen, who played
on their respective high school
teams.

Starting next week the girls
will have formal practice every
afternoon on the three lower
courts below Stowe Tennis
House.

The team will not play any
matches until spring term when
15 or 20 matches are scheduled
including ones with Duke,
Mary Baldwin, Hollins, Ran-
dolph-Macon, and UNC.

Presently, Frank has applied
for a budget in order to finance
equipment and travel expenses
(for a trip to Virginia).

Frank admits the schedule is
tough, yet he believes the girls
to be sound, strong, and steady
players.

He stated, ‘‘Tennis is a sport
Davidson coeds could get into
quickly at an_ intercollegiate
level without involving many
people at the outset.”’

promising potential for a win-

== Coming Net Campaign

Will Rebuild - Frank

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

After an exceptionally strong
1973 season, the Davidson
College tennis team will be in
the midst of a rebuilding year
during the upcoming season.

Following the first few weeks
of fall practice, head coach Jeff
Frank expressed his concern
for the future.

“We are definitely in the
rebuilding stage right now,”’ he
said. ‘‘We are going to be hard-
pressed to come close to last
year’s showing, especially in
the Southern Conference.”

Within the conference realm,
the defending champion Cats
will be challenged by both Ap-
palachian and Furman for the
title. William and Mary will
also be close in the dogfight.

“I guess Appalachian would
be rated as the top contender
for the crown this year,’’ com-
mented Frank. ‘‘They have got
about nine players on scholar-
ship and have all but one of
their top six starters retur-
ning.”’

The Mountaineers will have
an added advantage in the con-
ference tournament, as it will
be played in Boone.

One advantage that the Cats
possess in the regular season
matches with both Furman and
Appalachian is that both will
come here for the encounter.

“This will be one point in our
favor for sure,’’ said Frank, in
his first year as permanent
head coach after serving last
season as interim replacement

THIS ISN’T A FOOTBALL

Veteran rugby player Steve Morris handles ball in a recent mat-
ch against Duke, which the team lost 16-4. However, Davidson's B
team beat the Duke team handily 18-0. Interest in the game has
picked up considerably so that Davidson now fields two teams in
most matches. Many players affirm that while playing in the
games is fun, the beer parties afterwards are immeasurably bet-

ter.

when the late Harry Fogleman
passed away. ‘‘Appalachian is
used to playing more on the
hard courts, so this will help
us.”

Outside the conference the
Cats will face*Some very tough
opponents. A match with UNC
at home highlights the com-
petition. along with clashes
against Duke, MIT, Amherst,
Presbyterian and Delaware.

“We have really got another
tough schedule,” Frank ex-
plained. ‘‘Carolina is the big
one, of course. They will be
super-tough again.”

Frank also noted that the
team so far has 22 confirmed
matches and he hopes to add
two or three more.

Speaking of the members ot
this year’s team, Frank men-
tioned Bill Allen and Rick Quin-
by as the top men at this point.

‘They have both been playing
real well,’ he praised. ‘One
good thing is that they are
playing very close to each other
so they have some competition
to make them work harder.”
