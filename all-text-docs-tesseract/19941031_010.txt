Still
Whistlin’ Dixie

You have to
love Lyle’s

latest:

I Love
Everybody

By Geoffrey Graham

I Love Everybody.

So says Lyle Lovett’s latest
album cover. And I really think he
means it.

I Love Everybody holds eigh-
teen songs and a full hour of mu-
sic—something unheard of in
country. Most impressive, how-
ever, is the caliber of every song on
the album.

Lyle. returns to the simple,
three chord arrangements of his
earlier works. All but one of the
songs use four or fewer instru-
ments, and most feature little or no
background vocals (save a few
where Julia Roberts and other
friends make guest appearances).

_ “Penguins” is the one excep-
tion to the rule on the album. Lyle
returns to the Lyle Lovett and his
Large Band sound as he busts out
the trumpets and trombones. Not
that monotony would set in with-
out this brief departure, but “Pen-
guins” does provide a little alter-
native—whether needed or not.

The rest of the album is just
guitar and singer, with a little help
from the occasional fiddle or
drums. Lyle sings intelligent—
and where appropriate, extremely
witty— lyrics and plays perfect
guitar with certain sincerity.

No bad songs taint the album,
but a few stand out as particularly
wonderful. Well, hell; I was about
to list them, but they’re all great.
The particularly particularly won-
derful ones, however, are his lost
or unrequited love songs.

In “Skinny Legs,” my theme
“song, Lyle begs for a little atten-
tion, despite his lack of anything
his angel might want.

In “Sonja,” my other theme
song ... well, let me just tell you the
first line: “I’ ve never been lucky at
picking up women.” Youcan judge
for yourself what this one’s about.

“Moon on my~Shoulder” is
the saddest song on the album.
“They said time would take care of
it / I wish time would take care of
me.” I think time has, Lyle dedi-
cates the album to Julia.

Most of these songs will make
you smile, and every one will im-
press you. I’m not exaggerating
when I say this is my favorite al-
bum right now. I love it.

If you’d like to start yourcoun-
try collection and you’ re afraid to
dive into the mainstream, here’s a
little piece on the edge that's defi-
nitely worth consideration. Buy it,
listen toit, and go tell someone you
love them.

What are you doing for
Halloween? ;
This seems to be the
question on many Davidson
students’ minds today. Without

All Hallow’s Eve
scares students to Chapel Hill

as many choices for activities on
campus as in the past, the largest
Davidson Halloween party this
year may be in Chapel Hill.
When told that many
Davidson students were going to

The 725 Main Street Jack-o-Lantern

Chapel Hill tonight, Jennifer
Tracey ironically responded,
“What a surprise.”

Every year, hoards of
Davidson students make the two
hour drive to Chapel Hill on All
Hallow’s Eve. Senior Matt
Melton explains the attraction:
“Well, I went there two years
ago, and it was pretty crazy.
There will be about 30,000 drunk
kids running around, so it will be
really fun,”

There are some activities
planned on campus, however.
Rusk is having a lock-in with
freshmen that will open up at
11:00 pm. Susan Blue, a
freshman, thinks that is where
she will go. ;

In addition, members of
Kappa Sigma will be having an
off-campus cocktail party to start
off the night. Finally, residents
of Building F are planning an

' Around the World party of their

own.

SAE’s annual Halloween
party, however, will not be held
this year due to the party-
registration policy. Kurt
Holmes, the Patterson Court
Advisor, explains that the

Alcohol Policy allows only two
week-night parties per week.
These parties are assigned to
houses on a first come, first ;
served basis, Rusk and Connor
both registered week-night
parties before SAE.

Rusk Social Chairman,
Nicole Wilcox, regrets the
situation. “We had no idea SAE
would not be allowed to have a
party if we had our lock-in. We
weren’t trying to compete with
them; we just thought we’d both
be allowed to have parties.”

Senior SAE, Jim
Shumadine, says, “It’s really sad
that we can’t continue a tradition
that started in the mid-1800s.
We’ ve always had a party on this
night, even before there was
‘Halloween.””

Regardless, most Davidson
students have not decided what
they will dress up as or if they
will even go out.

Junior Javier Salazar says, “I
may just throw On the afro wig
[that I wore to Tacky Party] and
head for Chapel Hill.”

Freshman Abigail Bergsma
States, “I’m not planning to go
out, but I probably will.”

“Ghosts, power and love:

from history to storytelling”

By Kelly Dixson
& Courtney Cooper

Despite the terrible weather, a
large number of students, faculty,
and guests of the International His-
panic Women Writers Conference
attended the performance of bilin-
gual storyteller Olga Loya and the
presentation by Chilean author and
literary critic Marjorie Agosin.
Both guests presented important
facets of Latin American history,
yet their styles were unique.

Loya began the program with
a personal story called “True
Love,” which told the story of the
love affair between her immigrant
grandparents. Loya’s style of
storytelling in both English and
Spanish, seemingly at the same
time, mades her presentation in-
triguing. The next story, a per-
sonal favorite, gave an interesting
twist to one of México’s. most fa-
miliar figures, La Malinche. His-
torians have traditionally portrayed
her as a traitor to the Indians; how-
ever, Loya represented her as a
“cultural scapegoat” who was in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
In the next story, “La mujer
hambrienta,” Loya successfully
captivated the entire audience,
inspiringd audience participation.
Loya then interpreted a traditional
folktale and a Latin American leg-
end. She closed her portion of the
program with a fable, the moral
being to recognize the gifts you

have that make you special.
Agosin began by giving a brief
lesson in Chilean history involv-
ing the Pinochet dictatorship, dur-
ing which thousands of protesters
simply disappeared. She contin-
ued evoking the audience’s emo-
tions by describing the women left
behind and their attempts to ex-
press themselves in a censored so-
ciety. Agosin’s presentation in-
cluded slides of the arpilleras, a

folk art in which scraps of material
gathered by them or donated by the
Church are cut and sewn together
to produce a tapestry which sym-
bolically tells a story. The idea
behind creating these lasting art-
works centers around: the belief
that “a country. with a memory is a
country full of ghosts that will come
tohauntus.” Therefore the memory
of the disappeared lives on in these
arpilleras. Some arpilleras from

Agosin’s personal collection were
displayed that evening in the Wil-
son Room, and Professor Cecilia
Montero donated an arpillera from
Peru to be raffled off.

- Thanks toa grant by the North
Carolina Humanities Council and
the efforts of Drs. Mafz-Pejia and
Pefia, Sonya Kapoor, Katherine
Ross, and a devoted group of stu-
dents, the program was a huge suc-
cess .
