Koestner discusses ways to handle date rape on a college campus

Critique from page |

itself whispers “drive me,’ Normais
still legally accountable if she drinks
and drives.”

Similarly, when both Norm and
Norma are drunk, and Norm starts
throwing his clothes off, if Norma
acts on his invitation she will be
held accountable when Norm wakes
up the next morning and feels taken
advantage of.

“Tt may seem unfair,” Koestner
said, “but as the initiator, it is
Norma’s responsibility to make sure
that, number one, the potential re-
cipient is capable of giving consent
and, number two, that he is giving
consent.” In this case, Norma was
not capable of giving his consent
because he was drunk.

Koestner also cited the
Davidson definition of rape as prob-
lematic.

According to the handbook,
“rape is forced sexual intercourse
that is perpetrated against the will
of the victim; it occurs if one person
uses force or the threat of force to

which the policy is applied. ~ by the Sexual Misconduct Board.
When a student filesa formal This board is comprised of three
Honor Council members,
three faculty, and an admin-
istrator. Koestner said that
other options should be
available. ©

“Most rapes occur fresh-
man year between the first
day and the first break. How
would you feel if you knew
that a professor who could
potentially teach one of your
major requirements was go-
ing to sit in at your rape
trial?” She suggested that a
one-on-one hearing be made
available.

The accuser and accused
are also allowed to have oth-
ers present at the hearing
according to current proce-

,dures, but to what end. Can
an alleged rapist who plays
a sport have all his or her
teammates at the hearing?

Can alternate arrange-

ments be made if the accuser does

not want to sit in the same room

coerce another, regardless of the
relationship between them.”

Koestner did commend
the use of the word “coerce,”
which, unlike the word “se-
duction,” indicates that the ini-
tiator had only his or her own
satisfaction in mind.

In addition, she suggested
that “force” should read “in
timidation: uses physical size
or strength,” and that “threat”
should not only includethreats ~
of force, but a range of threats
suchas, “if you don’t have sex
with me, I'll tell everyone
you’re HIV positive,” or “if
you don’t have sex with me
Ill break up ‘with you.”
Davidson’s policy would cur-
rently have to be reinterpreted
in each case regarding rape
using threats.

Not only is it important to
revise the policy, which will
happen in the near future ac-
cording to Dean of Students
Tom Shandley, but Davidson must
also scrutinize the procedure by

complaint, one of their options is
to have the complaint adjudicated

with the accused?

Does the board vote have to be
unanimous?

Will the board hear cases that
occur off campus, or over spring
break or summer vacation?

Koestner noted that in addition
toa lack of clarity, Davidson proce-
dure does not address the initial
response to an assault victim. Resi-
dent Advisors do not have more
than a paragraph on rape response
in their guidebooks.

“Everyone in the institution
should have a step by step check-
list,” said Koestner. “Anonymous
reports should be sent to the coordi-
nator, who does a kind of case man-
agement. This lets you have an on-
going study of sexual assault cir-
cumstances on your campus and
establishes better reporting.”

There are numerous changes to
the policy and procedure which need
to be addressed.

Only through revision and
“practicing scenario after scenario
after scenario” will they function at
Davidson. -

Katie Koestner presented:
“Someone was Raped” Wednes-
day, a workshop on rape response’
which was mandatory for Resi-
dent Advisors and Hall Counse-
lors. Georgia Ringle expects to
coordinate an additional first re-
sponders unit with which rape vic-
tims may seek support.

Koestner’s workshop aimed
to prepare responders in the event
that someone should confide in
them, “I was raped.” What fol-
lows is basically a checklist that a
first responder would use to aid a

tion where they too might need to
advise a hallmate, friend, or sib-
ling.

The initial responsibility of a
first responder is to be a listener.

A responder should have a
place in mind where he or she can
listen toa potential victim. It should
be quiet, private, and located on
neutral ground. He or she should
ask the victim if they would like to
go somewhere in particular but be
able to suggest a place just in case.
A responder should have a “do not
disturb” sign and should turn off
the ringer on the telephone.

Sitting about three feet away
from the victim, a first responder
should offer—not request— “if
you need a hug, I’m here for you.”
| Phrasing it this way makes contact
available to the victim, but he or
she doesn’t feel pressured to re-
spond immediately.

A firstresponder should never
judge the victim or their story.
What he or she says may be
jumbled or selective, especially if
underage drinking or drugs are
involved and the victim wants to

Your role as a
first responder

avoid legal entanglements.

A first responder’s second role
is as an option-provider.

Presenting medical attention
as an option is top priority. A first
responder should explain to the
victim that a rape kit can only be
administered within 72 hours of
the assault. Wounds are treated,
and the victim is tested for preg-
nancy and sexually transmitted
diseases. The procedure takes
about five hours and costs between
$500 and $1,000.

A responder who escorts a
rape victim to the hospital should
be sure to take any evidence, such
as clothing, in paper rather than
plastic bags.

The results are kept on file for
a year afterwards, but having a.
rape kit performed does not mean
that the victim must press criminal
charges or file a complaint. There
is a statute of limitation of five to
eight years, which means that up
to eight years may pass before the
victim decides to take legal action.

The rape kit proves who raped
the victim, but it is difficult to
prove whether there was coercion
in many cases.

Researchers at the University
of Arizona are currently develop-
ing methods which recognize cer-
tain patterns of bruising as indica-
tive of coercion.

It is also the responder’s re-
sponsibility to present the options
listed in the Handbook, such as
whether the victim can change resi-
dence or classes, what kind of le-
gal action he or she can take, and
who at the school will hear his or
her case.

Counseling is another option
which is available to the victim.

The responder can strongly
recommend that the victim seek
counseling through the Counsel-
ing Center or peer advisors.
