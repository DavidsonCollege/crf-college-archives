A REVIEW

With a great deal of embar-
rassment, I must admit that it
took me nearly two years to
discover Spoon’s, or should I
say nearly two years to get the
courage up to go inside.
Anybody who gets to Char-
lotte occasionally, and I guess
that includes all of us, has
seen Spoon’s at some time or
another. Located on Haw-
thorne Street, between Inde-
pendence and Elizabeth near
Presbyterian Hospital, it
stands out as a memorial to a
neighborhood that hopefully
knew better times. Maybe it’s
not impressive on the outside,
but remember beauty is often
only skin-deep.

The success of Spoon’s is a
tribute to its proprietor, Mrs.
Elizabeth Spoon. Assuming
control of operations after the
death of her husband, the
establishment has been in the
family for roughly fifty years.
If you can remember back to
when they sold Jack’s Cookies
for a penny, and the cure for
cancer came in a bottle, then
you have some idea how long
Spoon’s has been serving
Charlotte.

Mrs. Spoon is a very lively
and witty lady who is living
testimony to the fact that life
begins at 65. Blessed with a
thousand memories, she cre-
ates a striking impression
upon all who enter.

Having apparently resided
throughout the length and
breadth of the Confederacy
during her lifetime, she grabs
her listeners’ attention with
her straight-faced declaration
that Charlotte has been the
best of them all. All done

‘without so much as a snicker,
too. She likewise can give
glowing accounts of a time
when Queens was somewhere
just this side of Camelot, and

A REVIEW

“Wilson,” the first major produc-
tion of the Davidson College drama
department this season is, at least,
challenging to the viewer.

Greanias’ play portrays Woodrow
Wilson as a-man of extremes—a
somewhat manic personality pursued
by either elation or depression.

The play opens significantly with a
buoyant Wilson eagerly rubbing his
hands together at the prospect of
peace (with himself as supreme peace-
maker); it closes with a picture of
Wilson at his worst, embittered and
broken in spirit.

Those who would come to see
Wilson presented either as demon or
saint will be sorely disappointed. The
‘dramatic hero of ‘‘Wilson,” in short,

is neither superman nor villain, but,
like most of us, distinctly human.

Unlike most of us, though, Wilson
has a vision and an overweening
passion to make that vision a reality.
This passionate vision was, of course,
Wilson’s desire to bring a permanent
peace in a single stroke of diplomacy
to a world devastated by war.

Yhroughout the play, Wilson is
portrayed—successfully, I might
add—as this man engulfed by the
passion of peace-making. In-the end,
Wilson falls tragically because that
passion has consumed him.

Strong individual performances in-
clude Rick Roylance as Wilson,
although his performance is distinctly
better in the second act than in the
first.

Perhaps we become more used to
the discrepancy of appearance be-

every Davidson Man stopping
in with his Queens honey. (In
fact it’s even been rumored
that the demise of the latter is
a result of frequent visits to
Mrs. Spoon’s Parlor, her gene-
rous servings of ice cream
sounding a death knoll to
many a shapely Southern
belle.)

In a more serious vein, she
even tells of the latest spree of
robberies, her description of
which arouses feelings of pity

and rage toward anyone who
could be so low as to rob this
missionary of good will.
Homemade ice cream is and
has been the reason that Mrs.

Spoon’s customers always
come back. Exactly how many
kinds are available depends on
what she decides to make that
week, all flavors made in the
modest quantity of five gal-
Jons at a time, and all equally
superb. Sherbert comes in

tween actor and historical character
(which, incidentally, was none too
subtly ingrained into our conscious-
ness by massive drama department
publicity). Or perhaps Roylance feels
more comfortable with his role itself
by the second act.

Marlin Geiger as Henry Cabot
Lodge plays a convincing adversary
to Wilson. At times his portrayal as
the spiteful foe is too strong for the
audience to believe, but this does not
in any way take away from his
performance,

Finally, Frazier Marsh as Clemen-
ceau and Richard Fay as Orlando
provide (respectively) refreshing com-
ic relief at a point at which the
seriousness of the drama is beginning
to take its toll upon the audience.

Presenting Wilson either dramati-
cally or historically is a difficult task

more. Indeed, there have been
those who have made a Satur-

of these delights. Let your
imagination run wild as to

even been known to refill her
customer’s glass when part-

‘Man a

“Ants’: This Lloyd Menard work

show on display in Cunningham.

A REVIEW .

“Strange Sensibilities,”’ the show
of prints and drawings now in
Cunningham, presents what the ex-
hibition pamphlet calls ‘“‘a fantastic
reality.”’ The description is quite apt,
for the show deals with the depiction
of things that might happen but as
yet thankfully have not.

In ‘Strange Sensibilities’” the skin
of a fly has been successfully grafted
onto a girl. The invisible man is
running for president. ‘‘Everything
Points” to a criminal sitting by the
fire with his dog.

In every composition, something is
happening, and although that some-
thing may be very queer, it is at the
very least unambiguous action.

Participating in the show areé five
artists whose work has appeared in
Davidson Nationals. Each artist is
enough of an individual to make the

cream sandwiches also. Get-

show a show of variety. No one needs
go and come home wholly disa-
pointed.

George Kitta has won purchase
prizes at The Davidson National. He
uses pencil, ink, photographs, and the
lithograph process to depict catas-
trophe. Things occur in Kitta’s work
to faceless humans. Monsters come
out of the sea and women scream,
horror strikes in every composition.
His work is gripping and frightening,
proof that man does dream in black
and white.

Particularly interesting is Kitta’s
“Everything Points.’’ In this compo-
sition, the usual and many unusual
techniques of motion are employed to
direct the eye to a criminal.

He is reading a paper with his dog
in front of a fire place. The logs|in the
fire, the dog’s tail, the tiles on the
floor, the corner of the mantle, all
point at a man with a hat and gloves
on, reading a newspaper. The paper
describes the story of a man at large.
