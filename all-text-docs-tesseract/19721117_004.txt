How's Housing?

The reality of coeducation and the decision to
increase the size of the student body to 1500. has
forced the college to take a much-needed look at its
present and future housing policies and facilities.

The complexity of the situation. involving financial
considerations as well as questions of student
interest. will require the most careful and serious
study before anv new residences are built.

It is of utmost importance. however. that the
mistakes of the past not be repeated The currer:
dormitories. especially Belk. are barely Jiveable
Long i..-::1 nalls. lack of adequate study and iounge
facies. and a dearth of common interests io draw
students together. force residents to live in isola‘ior.

Although «we must take into consideration the
financiai feasibility of new housing patterns. we
firmly peheve that the well being of students should be
of prime importance We must explore ali
possibilities of funding in order to maintain our
current low rate of room rent

As the college considers new housing. we believe
certain provisions to be indispensable for successful
and happy living in them First. the monolithic mind
Must give way to small group thinking. the Belk
Dorm concept must be neglected in favor of smaller
living units which will provide students with more
living space and more satisifving interaction with
their peers. Twelve to 16 students residing in rooms
around a central lounge area. we find a satisfving
method of housing.

Students also deserve the right to privacy afforded
by a private. single room. if they so desire. New
housing must include more single rooms. both for
men and women. That 85 percent of the coeds this
vear wanted single rooms may indicate a trend for
the future.

In addition to planning future housing. the college
must take a $50 step to make the present dorms more
livable. The addition of lounges. game rooms and
carpeting should first be considered. Even making
Suites out of some 10 rooms in Belk is not a far fetched
idea.

The college must be deft enough to plan flexible and
ingenious housing which will meet needs of future
generations of students. Such will not be an easy task.
Most housing is planned to satisfy students who have
graduated by the time the rooms are ready to be
occupied. Davidson must look ahead. especially if the
new housing is to be used as long as the present
housing has been.

Student Activities Car

The student Senate acted with prudence Monday
nignt when it referred the proposal to purchase a
student activities: car to a committee for further
study

There 1s no doubt that such a vehicle will greatly
help certain organizations on campus by providing a
ready means of transportation. That the student
government and the administration are cooperating
in this venture is also an encouraging sign.

But despite the virtues of this proposal. many
pitfalls lie ahead unless the committee minutely
details exactly how the car shall be used: general
priorities will not suffice. Ultimately someone will
have to decide which organization mav use the car.
‘But if a conflict arises. who will be the one to decide
what organization’s request is more valid than
anothers”

The activities car at St. Joseph's College of
Philadelphia caused similar difficulties for that
school. Although their student government admitted
the car was useful. thev found the problem of priority
almost insoluable.

We encourage the ad hoc committee which will
study this problem to view all aspects of an activities
car. It is possible that $1700 may cause more
disappointment and protest than the car will be
worth. But we hope not.

Problems Of Classics Abroad
Indicate Need For Revisions

AN ANALYSIS

By, ROBERT TOUCHTON
Associate Editor

The time has come again for
hopeful world travelers to ca~!
their lots with the fates and
pray that they can join that
select group known as Alumni
of Classics Abroad

Ine concept of Classics
Abroad is great--studving
classical art, architecture.
religion and literature in their
native surroundings. And no
matter how it is executed. that
concept remains to make the
program perhaps the best
foreign studs program at this or
any other college.

It is in the execution rather
than the concept that objection
can be found to Classics
Abread The length of ume for
the seminar 1s very nearly
ideal. being long enough to cure
a person of many of his
American hangups without
leaving him too long without
American comforts

And it gives a student a wide.
broad. indepth look at other
cultures that few travelers can
hope to get There 1s vamety as
well as more than just cursory
study

The difficulties ot Classics
Abroad come with what one
student called “the wavering.
uncertain personality of the in-
siructor It is never pieasant to
ded: in personaiities. but
through continuous serviee as
instructor. George Labban has

possible to separate the
program irom the instructor in
honest discussion

And it is only through honest
discussion that the problems of
the program can be solved to
the mutual benefit of —par-
ticipants and program.

Last vear’s group was never
certain where it stood with Lab-
ban. what hts response would be
lo even a simple ‘Good mor-
ning . or what his next move
would be

And since he held both the
power of the gradebook a
power ever, student un-
derstands and the power

delegated by Dr Bevan toter-
minate a persons connection
with the seminar at anv time he
saw fit. we were really at his
mercy

Qur: pride and self-respect
were severely hurt many mes
as we were pul in demeaning
Situations. We were almost
never told where or when we
were going next

One time. in Olympia. where
we were paving exorbitant
Prices for mest inadequate
rooms, we were forbidden to go
into each other's rooms. cer-
tainly a slap in the face of anv
20 or 21-vear-old in a prestige
college. The same restriction
held elsewhere.

Appeals to reason did little
good. I complained that I did
not think we were getting our
monev's worth in that par-
ticular hotel. only to be told that
I had ‘no grounds for com-
plaint '. even though I could see
by that time that the seminar
was already costing more than I
had anticipated or been led to
beheve

The program 1s considerably
more expensive than it might
be. and a serious case can be
made for a re-evaluation of the
way students’ very precious
money is spent Our ac-
comodations were extremely
erratic

At times no plans had been
made for our accomodations, at
least as tar as we could see.
other times we staved only ina
