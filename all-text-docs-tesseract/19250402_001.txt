With weather better suited for football
than a track meet and with a regular bliz-
zard during the afternoon the Davidson
Track Team lost to the Gobblers last Satur-
day by the score 80 to 46. Due to the severe
Weather conditions of both cold and high
wind the entire meet was slowed up. The
running events were affected to such an ex-
tent that the time was not up to the stand-
ard; the pole vault was also considerably less
than it should be.

Goodykoontz, of Davidson, was high point
man of the meet with two first places and
one second. His time of 22.8 for the 220
Was just one-fifth slower than the college
record. ;

Davidson captured six first places in the
meet: the 120 hurdles, high jump, 220 dash,
440, 880, and the javelin throw. Tech, on
the other hand, took cight firsts with the
100-yard dash, discus, shot put, two-mile,
mile, 220 hurdles, broad jump and pole vault,
Second places were a big factor in the high
score of the Gobblers with 11 against David-
son’s two.

this being the first time Oak Ridge has
swept the series. Both teams played medi-
