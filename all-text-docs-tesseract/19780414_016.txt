Bernie and Hogman have just
obtained the latest word on the
Davidson basketball recruiting
situation, and would like to
pass it on to our readers before
Richard Sink gets an opportuni-
ty to butcher the story in the
Charlotte Inquirer. We are sure
that once you have had a chance
to look these players over you
will be just as excited about
next season as we are. Here’s
the poop:

NCAA scholarship--Abdi was

South Africa grabbing coconuts
out of trees--he will participate
in our international studies

“Abdi is the type of player we
can build our whole program
around. He was a great find,
but he must learn to wear shoes

and gym shorts instead of -

. leaves.”

Dore is about seven years away
from being a competitive college
player but with a weight train-

years away— ‘‘perfect man for
the forward position.”

much needed physical element
to our game.
6) Bob Smith--6'1’’, 160 lbs.--
Huntersville, N.C.--Bob was
the last recruit signed--Bieden-

he’s also white.”’

A BB and H congratulations
to Eddie for an outstanding
recruiting season.

The IMAC softball season
continues to speed merrily on
its way. Our top ten saw a few
changes from last week:

BB&H TOP TEN
1-Presto’s Grille
2-Dartus Tunic and the Big 13
3-Mac Fleet and Stuff
4-Four Skins
5-SAE’s
6-Big T & the Oxytoxins

“ 7-Lizard Kickers

8-We Funk

9-Up and Coming

10-Old Men

Honorable Mention: Bongs,

What It Is, Bone, Whizz Kids
In softball action this week,

the biggest story is the sudden

emergence of the SAB’s into our

top ten. The E’s, utilizing a

balanced team of Khakis and
Kiss, vaulted to our #5 spot as
they thrashed Up and Coming
24-14. Team captain Mike
Sheridan was ‘‘pleased as
punch”’ about the sudden recog-
nition of the E team.

In other games involving top
ten teams, Presto’s Grille hung
-on to the number one spot by
thrashing the Ragmen 24-1.
Dartus Tunic remained in
strong contention for the num-
ber one position as they nipped
the Old Men 5-4 on George
Flower’s seventh inning sacri-
fice fly. Jack Davis continues to
lead the Big 13 in swinging
bunts with 21 so far.

The Lizard Kickers polished
off Ernie Church and Spring
Fever 16-4 but then fell victim
(bless.their hearts, huh Billy?)
to Quick Insertion 23-16. Big T
and the Oxytoxins utilized the
tennis talents of Grady Barnhill
to squeak by Pike’s Once, 6-3,
5-7, 6-4.

Sandy ‘Dr. Reject’’ Tarleton
continues to terrorize baserun-
ners with his cannon arm as he
gunned down three more this
week. Sandy could knock a fly
off of third base with a pebble
from center field.

In other games of unimpor-
tance, Bone took the War Kiwis

18-15 and the Bongs whipped
the Cavanaugh Kids 13-1. All of
the IMAC games played so far
would have been a lot more fun
if the official showed up occa-
sionally.
Later.

Netters continue domination

By DAVID REICH
Staff Writer

Davidson's tennis team boos-
ted its overall record to 19-3
with convincing victories over
Citadel, VMI, and Washington
& Lee. These wins also upped
the Cats’ conference record to
3-1 and set an optimistic tone
for the approaching conference
tournament.

However, Gocch dT eff Frank

and the Wildcat netters are not
looking past matches with up-

coming conference foes Appala-
chian and Furman. As Frank
stated, ‘‘Both of these teams
have been successful this year
and are just as anxious for a
conference win as we are:”’

Frank also emphasized that
these matches are an important
determinant of the seedings at
the conference. tournament.

Entering these last weeks of
the season, several individual’
netters boast impressive re-
cords. At the tough number one
singles spot, Mike Barnhill has
an 11-9 record.

Chip Bondurant continues to
win consistently at the number
two singles position and boasts
an impressive 4-0 conference
and 18-2 overall record.

.At the number three singles,

position, Harry Griffith holds a
17-4 record. Jeff Lyle, at the
number four spot, maintains a
12-5 overall record with only
one conference loss.

John Trout and Brian Cooper
at number five and six singles
are both undefeated in confe-
rence play. Trout has an overall
13-5 record, and Cooper holds
an impressive 15-3 record.

Alternating at the number six
spot, Steve Holman has also
gained several key wins.

At the number one doubles
spot, Bondurant and Jay Gep-
fert hold an 11-5 overall record.
Barnhill and Gil Kayton have
only one conference loss at the
number two doubles and boast a
15-3 overall record.

Sg Sea

Lyle and Rick Johnston con-
tinue to play well at the number
three position with only one
conference loss and-a 13-3
overall record.

It is evident that Frank’s
pre-season-optimism for this
year’s team has proven valid.
Of twenty-two matches, the
Cats have lost only three.

Nevertheless, Frank empha-
sized that the team has not
reached their peak. As he
stated, ‘‘Each day we continue
to improve and grow more
‘confident. As we approach the
conference tournament, crowd
support, confidence, and ag-
gressive play are absolutely
essential to our success.”
