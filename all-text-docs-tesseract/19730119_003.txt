Honor Court Suspends Two Students

HUGH MOORE
Staff Writer

Honor violations during the
fall examination period resulted
in the suspension of two stu-
dents.

Declining to admit a violation
one of the students presented
his case in accordance with
governance regulations to the
Student Hearing Committee
(SHC). He was convicted of
having previous knowledge of
two of his final examinations.

The defendant was suspended
for a definite period of time and
will be permitted to re-enter
Davidson without making ap-
plication again when that
period has expired. ‘‘The com-
mittee also recommended that
his tuition be refunded,” Clay
said.

According to Dean of Students
Will Terry the case will be ap-
pealed to the Review Board.

In the second case, the
charged student admitted the
violation of dispensing in-
formation on a final
examination before the
examining period was com-

pleted. Accordingly he sub-
mitted to the imposition of sanc-
tions in an administrative con-
ference with Terry as outlined
in the governance regulations.

This student was likewise
suspended for a definite period
of time and will also be allowed
to return to Davidson without
making reapplication.

Although this examination
period produced the first ad-
ministrative conference since
the beginning of the year and the
first trial before the SHC since
this time last year, neither
Terry nor Clay felt this reflec-
ted adversely on either the
general principle of self-
scheduled examinations or on
the new method of ad-
ministering — self-scheduled
examinations.

In previous self-scheduled
examination periods, students
were required to produce a
schedule indicating when they
would take specific
examinations and were also
required to produce iden-
tification when they picked up
their examinations at Cham-

Senate Tabulates
Data On Relations

By MARK DEATON
Staff Writer

The results of the Student
Government Association(SGA)
questionnaire on_ student-
faculty relationships were
tabulated Wednesday. with
much of the data inconclusive.

SGA President Ralph Peeples
expressed his dissatisfaction
with the questionnaire results.
‘I can live with the results that
we did get, but the number of
responses to the questionnaire
was very disappointing.”
Peeples said.

Only 508 of the 1100 question-
naires issued to students were
returned.

“It's impossible to interpret
much of the data when you get
less than half the question-
naires back. We don't know
anything about the 600 students

Peace Coalition
Attends Rally

By JIM JERNIGAN
Staff Writer

The Davidson Peace
Coalition will attend the
national anti-war demon-
stration tomorrow morning in
Washington.

It was explained at a meeting
Monday night that the National
Peace Action Coalition had
secured a permit to march from
the Lincoln Memorial to the
Washington Monument where a
rally will be held.

The March Against Death is
intended to be a silent public ex-
pression of the grief and
frustration towards the war.

It was agreed by all who at-
tended the meeting that only
quiet, peace:ul mourning will
be effective in calling attention
toa tired nation.

Housing arrangements have
been made with the Church of
the Pilgrim near Georgetown
University. The pastor of this
church is the father of Mark
Meza who graduated from
Davidson last year.

It was tentatively decided
that all planning to go should
meet at the Union early this af-
ternoon. The Coalition will
return Sunday morning.

who didn't respond,” said
Peeples.

Union Operations Manager
Howard Ramagli. who

tabulated the data and made a
simple analysis of the results.
expressed dissatisfaction with
the format of the questionnaire.
“It's a poor questionnaire,”
he said. *‘Many of the questions
were asked in a manner which
makes the responses virtually
impossible to tabulate.”

Of those students with a
definite prospective major, 247
of 315 found professors office
hours sufficient, 281 of 311 found
professors ‘receptive’ or ‘ex-
cited’ when contacted, and only
34 of 304 felt that they were
receiving less than ‘adequate’
personal attention in their
classroom work.

However, when asked about
social contacts with professors,
287 of 497 expressed dissatisfac-
tion, only 10 of 494 felt that
social contacts should be
decreased,, and 224 of 402 in-
dicated that they had never
been to a professor's house
socially. excluding their initial
visit to their freshman advisor's
home.

In addition, 392 of 502 students
responding did not know that
William Hight was director of
counseling services.

When asked if enough time is
spent with advisors before
registration, 265 students felt
that adequate time was spent
while 219 felt there was too little
time spent and 9 felt too much
time was spent with advisors.

Questionnaire responses also
pointed to a severe lack of
knowledge of the pre-law
program at Davidson. Only 8 of
54 pre-law majors felt that pre-
law advising was even
‘adequate’, 20 felt there was
adequate information con-
cerning graduate schools, and
17 pre-law majors felt their ad-
visors had  ‘‘adequate™
familiarity with graduate
schools to which they were most
likely to apply.

**| want to see Hight, Proctor,
and Bevan and then write up a
report--a_ salvage operation.”
said Peeples when asked what
action the SGA would take as a
result of the questionnaire.

bers Banquet Hall. During the
last examinations, however,
both of these requirements
were eliminated due to action
taken by the Educational Policy
Committee (EPC).

Terry said that this new
method had no bearing on the
case which came before him.

Clay suggested as a
safeguard that once again
students should be required to
produce identification when
picking up their examinations.
He did not, though. advocate a
return to prior scheduling.

Clay did say that he felt the

same about the honor system
now as he did before the
examination violations. I was
particularly encouraged that it
was students who turned in the
violators, he said.

Terry went one step further.
saying that he had never seen
students so concerned about the
system.

The Dean, however. felt
strongly that some faculty
members were doing harm to
the honor system by not
allowing their students to self-
schedule their examinations
simply because “they did not
trust them.”

Clay agreed, “It infuriates
me," he said. *‘for their
mistrust they implicitly feel the
honor system is worthless and
they are wrong."

Murray Delivers Two Lectures

On Media In Reynolds Series

By VAL VAN HORN
Staff Writer

J. Edward Murray, president
of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, editor of
Knight Newspaper Wire and
associate editor of ‘‘The Detroit
Free Press’’, lectured at Hod-
son Hall this week on ‘‘Threats
to Free Press in the Com-
munications Era” and
‘Morality and the Media in
Mao's China.”

‘‘We are moving rapidly from
the industrial era, in which
technology. and military power
have dominated,” said Murray,
‘‘into the communications era,
in which the dominant factor
will be the continuing explosion
of knowledge.”’

Murray looks at the media as
the means of communication
that are used by men to tran-
smit messages to other men.

Some of the more
sophisticated media mentioned
by Murray include information
transmission be laser beam,
computerized information
storage and retrieval, cable
television and communications
satellites. .

Satellites are one example of
the free media threatened by
censorship. Last August, An-
drei A. Gromyko, foreign
minister of the Soviet Union,
proposed strict censorship of
satellite communication by in-
dividual nations, Murray said.

Technology is being
developed so that ground tran-
smitters. now necessary for TV
Satellite signals, can be
bypassed with signals sent
directly into the receivers’
televisions. This would allow
viewers to receive uncensored
television from another nation.

To prevent this, Gromyko
proposed an international law
which would allow each govern-
ment to have the right to screen
satellite TV by controlling all
broadcasts at their source.

If necessary, the satellites
could be destroyed by force to
prevent unwanted broadcasts,
Murray said.

A vote was taken at the
United Nations General Assem-.
bly to begin drafting a world
treaty based on Gromyko's
ee Only the U.S. dissen-

“While the U.S. am-
bassador...defends the prin-
ciple of global free press...the
performance of the Nixon ad-
ministration...cannot be very
convincing to other nations,"
Murray said.

He referred to Vice President

Agnew's anti-press speeches in
1969, as well as Mr. Nixon's
more subtle tactics of com-
municating less in public press
conferences but more with
prime time TV addresses as
well as his private interviews
with favorable single jour-
nalists.

Another threat to free press in
the United States is the
Supreme Court's Caldwell
decision, or the decision that
newsmen have no legal right to
protect their confidential sour-
ces from grand juries.

Because of this, three news-
men have been jailed, others
threatened with jail and the
American public is deprived of
the information supplied by
confidential sources, Murray
said.

Although the Gallup Poll
revealed that the public
be ! required ot on.

to reveal con-
fidential sources, Murray feels
that it is doubtful this public
view will rally
behind shield iaws for
newsmen.

It is this apathy concerning
free press by citizens which is

~

one of the biggest threats,
Murray said. It is taken so
much for granted that people
will not be aware that it is being
taken over, as that of Mao's
China already has been.

‘“‘My main impression of
China,"’ said Murray, ‘‘is that
there is anew moral tone in the
country, a_ strong new
morality...Everything is clean.
Almost no crime. No ex-
ploitation of sex.”

Murray thinks that one an-
swer for this change in China is
lack of personal, political and
intellectual freedom.

*‘Lack of personal freedom is
literally destructive of
morality. A man who is com-
pelled to act morally...as in
China, by pressure from the
government, from his peers and
from the media...is not fully
moral in the best sense,"’ said
Murray.

“The great propaganda
pressure for conformity to a
si Maoist line in personal

political life constitutes a
harsh curtailment of
freedom. This cripples what I
have called the new morality in
China,” he said.

Murray came to Davidson un-
der the Reynolds Lecture Series.
