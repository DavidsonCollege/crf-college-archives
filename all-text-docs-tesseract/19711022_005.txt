LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Foerster Wants Coeducation Now

To The Editor:

There has been much discus-
sion on the topic of coeducation
here at Davidson College in THE
DAVIDSONIAN, in the SGA Sen-
ate, among the students at large,
and certainly among the faculty
and members of the adminis-
tration.

|! would, through this letter,
like to make several observa-
tions about the apparent crisis
that we ere now all facing:
shall we sexually integrate or
remain a segregated commu-
nity, a bastion of male living.

These observations should not
only be considered by students
and faculty but also more im-
portantly by the administration
and members of the Board of
Trustees, since the college pres-
ident, Dr. Samuel R. Spencer,
indicates that the decision final-
ly rests in their hands.

We have at Davidson College
a most novel environment. It
could perhaps be best termed
a microcosm of society, but in
a real sense a purified society.

It is a unique community that
prides itself on its academic
quality, its dedication to the
Christian faith, its moral and
social awareness which grows,
to a great extent, out of a de-
dication to Christianity, its open-
ness and genuine concern for
the needs and wants of others.

But Davidson and its environ-
ment sorely lacks in complete-
ness. Under the present struc-
ture, it, because of unnatural
limitations, has no other choice
but than to remain an unfilled
community.

Other issues, i.e., the com-
prehensive fee recently imple-
mented by the comptroller’s of-
fice, heated debates, faculty
meetings, student assemblies,
progressive educational imple-
mentations, Wednesday coffee
with Dr. Spencer, and all other
kinds of intellectual verbiage
will stir up the dust and take
attention away from the co-
education issue, but will fail to
obscure it.

Life at Davidson will continue
to be fragmented and unnatural
as long as we remain unisexed.

There are definite advantages
to having coeducation here at
Davidson College. One of the
most important is psychological
or emotional in nature.

Most sociologists agree that a
community is merely an exten-
sion of an individual personage.
Individuals naturally congre-
gate because it fulfills a human
need—interaction.

Man because of his created
nature has certain healthy psy-

chological needs for female
companionship.
Students, faculty members,

members of the administration.
and trustee members who op-
pose coeducation because it
would violate that sacred David-
son tradition of male celebacy
or for some other insane and
unhealthy reason are quick to
point out that Davidson stu-
dents do see girls, that they do
have female contact.

If they would, however, care-
fully examine the nature of this
contact they would quickly real-
ize its preverted nature.

Homecoming Is

‘Good Clean Fun’

Homecoming is Love. It is
simple yet so profound it brings
tears to the eyes of old alumni
and joy to the hearts of the
young.

It marks the close of sultry
summer with its sweltering
pavements and the advent of
fall with its pastel beauty.

Homecoming is thinking. of
Mom and Dad. It is holding
your sweetheart’s hand in yours.
It is frolicking about campus
carefree and full of life. It is
good clean fun.

Homecoming is memories. lt
is the lingering fragrance of e
corsage. It is a dream made up
of yesterday's hopes and today’s
realities.

Homecoming is a realigning
of priorities. It is a renewed
leap of faith. It is feeling a
warm thrill at seeing your flag.

Homecoming is realizing you
have come far in life. It is the
light at the end of the tunnel.
It is a reason to be.

Homecoming is Rod McKuen.
It is long walks on the cross
country course. It is a letter
from home. It is feeling a purge
of soul.

Homecoming is one lonely
tear. It is caring for those who
care for you. It is thinking of
your future. It is the pot of gold
at the end of a rainbow.

Homecoming is slapping your
professor on the back. It is the
freshman’s first feeling of be

longing. It is chasing the bright
elusive butterfly of love.

Homecoming is seeing the va-
por of your breath mingle with
that of your date. It is nostalgia.

Homecoming is the thrill of
the gridiron. It is the brilliance
of your school colors. It is run-
ning out on the field after the
game.

Homecoming is happiness. It
is frost on the pumpkins. It is
cookies from home.

Homecoming is never having
to say you're sorry. It is that
stolen kiss. It is counting the
stars. It is kittens and puppies.

Homecoming is the crowning
of a queen. It is the fraternity
sweetheart. It is a breath of
fresh air. It is a kiss in the
rain.

Homecoming is putting your
cares aside. It is kept promises.
It is a gentle rain on a chapel.

Homecoming is cheese, wine
and bread. It is Paris In the
spring. It Is a feeling of fulfill-
ment. It is the reunion with old
friends. .

Homecoming is a warm laugh
on a cold night. It is hot choco-
late on a snowy day.

Homecoming is Snow White,
Cinderella and Doris Day.

Homecoming is a once a year
happening.

Faith, Hope, Love, these three,
but the greatest of these is
Homecoming.

When members of the com-
munity (students) feel that it
is necessary to import prosti-
tutes (What - A - Burger - Winter
of 1970), there is something ter-
ribly wrong somewhere.

We, students, in our forma-
tive years, need educational ex-
periences which cater to all as-
pects of life.

I do not feel that any re-
sponsible individuals would term

the aforementioned experience
healthy and beneficial to human
development.

When deprived of natural liv-
ing conditions no matter what
means of pacification is fabric-
ated to cover its absence up
and that we are living in a de-
prived environment, experiences
like the above will continue,
some being more subtle than
others.

If the harmfu: effects which
something like the above causes
are to be avoided, we must co-
educate without unnecessary de-
lay. We are presently caught
up with unnecessary and harm-
ful discussion.

Coeducation is the only solu-
tion.

Poet To Give
Reading Monday

On the heels of Homecoming,
the Poetry Circuit will host its
first visiting poet this Monday.
He is Howard McCord, who will
be touring colleges all over the
Southeast for the next month.

In addition to McCord’s most
recent book of poetry, Maps.
published this past June, other
works include: Fables and Tran-
sfigurations, Longjaunes His
Periplus (which sold out within
a year of publication), The Fire
Visions, The Life of Fraenkel’s
Death, and The Spanish Dark.

This fall McCord became Di-
rector of the MFA Writing Pro-
gram at Bowling Green State
University in Ohio. For the
previous 11 years he had taught
poetry, mythology, and a course
in Eastern civilizations at Wash-
ington State University. McCord
took his B.A. from the Univer-
sity of Texas at El Paso, and
went to the University of Utah
as a National Woodrow Wilson
Fellow for his graduate work.

McCord will conduct a work-
shop in the newly-remodeled
Carolina Inn Monday at 3 p.m.
and will follow with a reading
that night at 7 p.m. in the
Union Bar.
