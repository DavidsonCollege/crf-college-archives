Funding sought for athletic complex

By MAHMOUD SAYANI
Staff Correspondent
Davidson is still looking for
enough money to finance its
proposed Athletic Complex, a
project the College has been

- planning since 1976.

Former Development Direct-

‘or Duane Dittman told The

Davidsonian in October, 1979
that the College would select an
architect for the building by the
end of the year.

Yet the College has still not
chosen an architect, and has not
decided exactly where the Com-
plex will be built or what
facilities it will contain.

Trustee Athletic Committee
Chairman Perrin Anderson
said, ‘‘Money is the basic
problem.” _

Cartmill said the administra-
tion asked him to scale down his
original proposal for the com-
plex in order to save money.

Even so, Cartmill said the
complex will cost considerably
more than the $3.5 million the
College had estimated in 1979,

Anderson said the Trustees
will be discoussing the complex
at their meeting in early May
and would probably make a
definite decision on what the
complex will contain ‘‘in the
next few months.”

Cartmill’s original proposal
called for a building containing
three basketball courts, six
raquetball courts, two squash
courts, six indoor tennis courts,
an indoor, track, and NCAA
regulation swimming and div-

ing pools.

Cartmill said he is now pro-
posing that the complex contain
the swimming and diving pools,
an indoor track, and facilities
for dance, gymnastics and.bad-
minton. He said he has not yet
abandoned hopes of getting all
of the facilities called for in his
original proposal.

The complex will probably be
built on the practice football
fields, Cartmill added.

The complex is one of the

major goals of Davidson's 1987 |

There are 64 students on the
waiting list for College housing
for next year, according to.
Housing Director Bill Bolding.
Bolding said that 40 women and
24 men are currently waiting for

An unusually large number of
women did not get rooms in last
week’s room lottery, Bolding
said. Normally only eight to ten
women get on the waiting list.
Last year there were 28 men and
10 women on the list.

Bolding said the list is longer
than he expected because there
were fewer requests for off-
campus housing and fewer stu-
dents going abroad or going on
leave.

Rooms will become available

Steaks from ETC, $100 from PiKA

fundraising program, begun in
1976. The program calls for $35
million in fundraising by 1987.
Dittman told The Davidsonian
in February, 1980, that as a
result of inflation, the College
would actually need to raise $45
million in ordér to complete the
projects the program was de-
signed to fund.

Dittman admitted that if the
current pace of fundraising
continued, Davidson would not
meet the $45 million goal.

64 students on waiting list

through the summer as stu-
dents finalize their housing
plans for next year, Bolding
said. He does not expect any
students to be forced into
triples. He will know by tomor-
row whether or not the college
will open up more perimeter
housing to seniors to alleviate
the shortage in women’s hous-
ing.

By tomorrow the Housing
Office will also have a list of off
campus housing available for
interested students.

The room drawing lottery
went smoothly and unusually
quickly this year, Bolding said.
The freshman class, which took
the longest, was done in two
and a half hours. In the past.
the lottery has lasted past mid-
night.

Food , money stolen from Patterson Court

By BOB FLEMMA
Staff Correspondent
Thefts of food and money
have occured at two Patterson
Court eating houses in the last
two weeks.
Fifty-six. steaks worth about
$150 were stolen from the ETC
kitchen two. weeks ago, accor-

lost $150 worth of steaks.

Jim Northrup locks ETC’s refrigerator after the eating house

ding to ETC House Manager
Wes Bean.

The incident, reported to
Security Chief Jackie Hughes
on Friday April 10, is tought to
have occurred that Thursday
night.

Sometime between last
Thursday and Saturday, PiKA

d

fraternity was robbed of around
$100.

Hughes says that he has no
suspects in either of the cases.

As a result of the ETC theft,
Bean said the house decided to
abandon its ‘‘open kitchen’’
policy. Shortly after the inci-

“dent, locks were installed on the
kitchen and refrigerator doors.
On the court ATO, F & M, and
SAE and Emanon have open
kitchens. PiKA, Rusk, KA, and
Phi Delt do not.

Hughes said this is the only
food theft he has known of in
the past. He did say, however,
that one year someone broke
into a house and ate their ice
cream.
According to PiKA house
Manager Jonathon West, the
cash was taken from a cabinet
which also contained checks.
The checks were left untouched.

West said the $100 was
proceeds from a T-shirt sale.
However, he said the house is
planning no major changes in
security.
