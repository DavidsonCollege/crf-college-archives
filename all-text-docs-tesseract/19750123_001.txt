Recommendations concern-

“I propose an across the

faculty and staff salaries,” said
Dean of the Center for Honors

For those staff members ear-

Harris’ ‘New Populism’ Damns
Centralized Political Powers

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
News Editor

Monopolistic industry is run-
ning the government of the
United States, according to
Senator Fred Roy Harris, a
democrat from Oklahoma and a
visiting Woodrow Wilson Fellow’
this week at Davidson.

“TI am now a candidate for the

presidency in 1976,’’ said
Harris. ‘“‘There has to be a
widespread diffusion of
economic and political power
instead of concentrated
political power,’’ he said.
Harris feels that the country is
run by a very few who have
their own interests at heart. He
hopes to change this situation
through his candidacy for
president.

“T am presently a professor
at American University in
Washington. I have not served
in the Senate since 1972, and I
feel I’ve benefited from my
sabbatical from the Senate. I
wouldn’t get back into political
life except that I want to mean
something to this country and
politics is what I know best.
People ought to govern them-
selves.

“Government -ought to look
after the interests of the aver-
age family instead of big busi-
ness and the super rich,’’ said
Harris.

Harris believes that the big
lesson that this country can
learn from Watergate is that

economics do enter into politics
in an influential role.

‘People now see that they are
being victimized by-big money.
The super-rich have used their
money to dominate politics,”
said Harris.

Due to Watergate and related
incidents, Harris believes that
the government is ready to
return to the people.

“The Campaign Financing
Law is the biggest piece of
political activity in my lifetime.
It provides for the federal
government to match campaign
funds of candidates in the
primaries. This will free the
average man, like myself, to
run for office,’ said Harris.

Harris has a 4-fold plan for

returning government to the
average man. He intends to
initiate these changes if elected
President. First, Harris
‘proposes a graduated income
tax with a massive tax cut of
between 20 and 28 billion dollars
for the low and middle income
man stair-stepping to a tax in-
crease for the very rich. These
tax reforms would include a
graduated tax for industry.

Secondly, Harris would place
controls on monopolistic in-
‘dustry in an effort to curtail un-
fair price-fixing by virtual
monopolies in the steel, energy,

and food industries. ¢
Third, Harris plans “vigorous
enforcement of anti-trust

laws.
“If monopolies were broken
up, and not allowed to form as

they have, prices would come
down naturally by about 20 per-
cent.”

Harris’ fourth proposal is for
a public service job program.
This would give more people
money to spend, according to
Harris.

‘‘We could pay people to build

housing as easily as we can
keep 150,000 troops in Europe.
We could employ people in
building schools, rebuilding our
cities, in building anti-pollution
devices. We don’t need to have a
wasteful Defense Budget as a
WPA project,”’ said Harris.
, Harris sought the Democratic
Party, nomination in ’72 un-
successfully. His thoughts then
were much the same as they are
today in the sense that then and
now he defines his kind of
politics as ‘‘The New
Populism.”

“‘We’re going back to people
responding to people’s needs
and to an assumption that
people are smart enough to
govern themselves. It is a
movement to get people in-
volved.

“The government right now
needs a change. It is run in an

elitest and secretive manner. .

For instance, now, Dr.
Kissinger almost runs the
foreign policy by himself in a
secretive manner,’’ said
Harris.

Harris’ belief that a very few
control the whole of American
politics.

“Just to give you an idea, 2.3

own 80 percent of the in-
dividually held corporate stocks
and 90 percent of the in-
dividually held corporate
bonds.

“35 percent of the American
industries with four or more
firms control 70 percent in sales
their area.

“To compound the problem,
utilities after what they call
promotioned rates so that the
more, say electricity, that B
used, the less it costs. In-
dustries that use the most elec-
tricity and are therefore the
biggest, pay less for that elec-

tricity.
“When a few corporations
control their respective

markets, the law of supply and
demand doesn’t work. We
citizens cannot participate in
price decision because of
monopoly control. In the past

~ this kind of economic power has

translated into ~ political
power,’’ said Harris.
“The centralization of money

and power in a few hands is the

’ greatest econoic issue today.

Our primary international
problem is a domination of
multi-national corporations.

“The great social issue of our
time is the fact that blue-collar,
working people, like you and
me, are having difficulty fin-
ding jobs while people like
Nelson Rockefeller, who has
never worked a day in his life
and doesn’t need to, run the
country.

“Since the laundry is no
longer operating at a deficit,
why can’t laundry services be
offered to students on a volun-
tary basis?’’ one student asked.

“If voluntary, it seems that
the laundry would operate on a
deficit,’ replied Currie.

During the current year, the
laundry is operating on an in-
come budget of $165,835. The
projected earnings for the laun-
dry in the academic fiscal year
of 1975-76 is $194,000.

Estimating an enrollment of
1250 students in 1975-76, the ex-
pected income budget from
students is $3,026,180. These
earnings represents an increase
of $193,500 above the present in-
come from students of
$2,832,680.

“The rise in expected ear-
nings is due to the increased
enrollment projected for next
year,’’ said Davidson.

Concerned over the increase
in the athletic budget, many of
the facuity members present
desired a department allocation
break-down.

“What is the amount ear-
marked for physical’
education?’’ asked Mac-
Cormac. He also wondered how
many students were attending
such classes as handball and
squash.

“We have requested more
money in an effort to give sup-
port to the minor sports.'In the
past they have often been
neglected,’’, explained Director
of Athletics Thomas A. Cart-
mill.

Another factor in boosting the
athletic budget concerned in-
creased transportation costs.

Over half a million dollars
was requested for the 1975-76
athletic budget. That figure
($507,198) represents an in-
crease of $70,172 over the
present budget of $437, 026.

Another pertinent topic of
discussion was financial aid to
students.

Although aid to students will
increase next year, the number
of students receiving scholar-
ship aid will decrease.

Committee Chairperson and
Professor of Economics Robert
Avinger reminded the at-
tendants that the budget
meeting was designed only to
answer questions and to hear
recommendations.

Approximately 40 members of
the faculty and staff and 10
students were present at the

budget meeting. \
