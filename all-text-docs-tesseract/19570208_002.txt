Playboy And Company--A Trend

At a time in our history when many
thoughtful Americans are pondering the
significance of the abnormally heavy em-
phasis on sex in our society, we might do
well to pause to consider the general situ-
ation and some of its specific aspects
familiar to the campus.

In the years since the war, the Ameri-
can public has been served a steadily in-
creasing diet of sex through the various
public media. The motion picture industry
has set the pace, perhaps more with their
suggestive advertising than in the actual
films. Television has followed eagerly,
though at a necessarily slower pace.

The country’s yellower newspapers
have cashed in on the sex bonanza by
splashing lurid headlines of rape and
scandal across their pages.

With this atmosphere as the tenor
of the times, it has hardly been surpris-
ing to note in the highly competitive and
progressive magazine industry the rise of
a type of publication which in magazine
form parallels the trends already men-
tioned.

We refer specifically to the whopping
success of Playboy, Nugget, Escapade,
Gent, Caper and the rest, whose circula-
tion hit an amazing high almost over-
night.

There has always been a considerable
market for sex literature, which through
the years has been pornographic to vary-
ing degrees. But the significant departure
initiated by these magazines is that the

tawdry side of sex is suddenly getting the
slick paper treatment, in contrast to the
obviously cheap pulp magazines which
have heretofore dominated this market.

Expertly composed and cleverly writ-
ten, most of these magazines are put to-
gether with as much. if not more, pro-
fessional finessé as the most eminently
respectable long-time standards of the
American newsstands.

With this slick paper approach as
the vehicle, a fashionably smart attitude
toward the sex theme is presented. Seduc-
tion and infidelity are subtly endorsed
as merely the sign of the times in which
we live.

This attitude is not new or novel or
even surprising. The. same outlook has
often been expressed before. But here
as never before, it is glossed over and af-
forded a deceptive aura of respectability
by the slickly professional style of pre-
sentation.

The implications seem to be plainly
evident. Immorality is rio longer labeled
as wrong, but, with a shrug of the edito-
rial shoulders, is merely considered to be
a part of an urbane, “sophisticated” so-
ciety. :

The dangers seem equally evident.
While the true beauty of sex is sneer-
ingly snubbed and lost in this porno-
graphic rat-race, the American public is
ravenously consuming an attitude toward
sex which can only end in degeneracy.

Will Wheels Turn Or Stall?

“Progress, therefore, is not an acci-
dent, but a necessity.” So wrote Herbert
Spencer.

Last month it seemed that the wheels
of Progress were again set to turn at
Davidson, at last it seemed time to call a
spade a spade, at last it seemed time to
label an A.B. degree an A.B. degree, and
a BS. degree a B.S. degree.

But at the final minute the proverbial

monkey wrench was thrown into: the’

works, the wheels were stalled, and Pro-
gress was delayed, but not stopped.

Now, with a new supply of oil, the
wheels of Progress are again ready to
turn. Whether or not those wheels will
actually move this time depends on
whether or not the faculty wants them
to turn.

At last month’s faculty meeting, the
vote to eliminate the requirement of
either Latin or Greek for an A.B. degree
was tied. Thereupon the faculty voted to
send the matter back to the Curriculum
Committee “for further study.”

The fact that the Curriculum Com-
mittee has been studying this very ques-
tion for the past three years, the fact
that Davidson stands almost alone in her
archaic Latin or Greek requirements for
an A.B. degree, the fact that the Commit-
tee was unanimous in proposing a change
—all this seemed to be overlooked by the
faculty in their vote.

Last month’s proposal submitted by
the Committee was so simple and so logi-
cal that alternate proposals and counter-
proposals served only to confuse and de-
feat the issue. What could be fairer or
more reasonable than what the Commit-
tee proposed, B.S. degrees for majors
in the natural sciences and math and A.B.
degrees for majors in the liberal arts?

What proposal, if any, the Curriculum
Committee will submit to the faculty at
‘its meeting on February 12 is of course
unknown.

But the wheels of Progress at David-

son have been stalled long enough! This
misrepresentation of fact, which clearly
the awarding of a B.S. degree to a History
major means, must be corrected.

On the birthday of the “emancipator”
of one type of slavery, let us hope that
we shall at last be emancipated from aca-
demic. slavery —A.W.F.B.

Language Lab

We noted with pleasure this week the
announcement that a language laboratory
will be set up in the Quadwranglers’
Room in Chambers for operation begin-
ning next fall.

Other schools have found the labora-
tory approach extremely helpful in teach-
ing foreign languages, in that it gives the
student an opportunity to practice pro-
nunciation and understanding of the
spoken word.

Individual practice along this line has
been well nigh impossible in the usually
overcrowded classes, especially on a basic
level.

Its inclusion in the instruction should
arouse added interest in the student, and
generally strengthen the language curri-
culum at Davidson.

Grads Pick English

What is the most valuable course to
study in college, from the standpoint of
both success in business and enjoyment of
leisure time? A survey by the General
Electric Company among 13,000 of its
college graduates produces this opinion:
English. Non-engineering graduates listed
it first among courses contributing most
to their success. Engineering graduates
listed it second after mathematics. Both
groups voted English literature the most
important as a background for pleasura-
ble leisure-time activities.

For the past four years the win-
ner of the Interfraternity Sports
Trophy has been decided by the
winning fraternity’s varsity ath-
letes and not through interfrater-
nity competition.

This seeming incongruity in the
intramural sports progrdm has
been caused by the “Varsity Com-
petition” clause in the By-Laws for
Intramural Svorts. Under this rule,
the fraternity with the largest per-
centage of its men out for varsity
athletics receives the same number
of points as the winner of the
football. basketball, or softball
competition.

Coach A. Heath Whittle, found-
er of the intramural system at Da-
vidson;, stated that emphasis had
been placed on the varsity compe-
tition category so that fraternities
would encourage their men to stay

out for varsity athletics, and leave
the interfraternity program for
those lacking in either time or
ability for varsity competition.

Coach Whittle’s purpose in in-
cluding the “Varsity Competition”
category is quite legitimate, but,
in actual practice, few fraternities
urge their men to stay out for
varsity sports to build up inter-
fraternity. points. Certainly, intra-
murals must be kept for those who,
for various reasons, are not var-
sity material.

However, the spirit of competi-
tion, so necessary in such a pro-
gram, would seem to be endan-
gered when the winner of the cov-
eted trophy is decided by a
coach's pencil, a mathematical
formula, and varsity athletes.

In recent years the possession
of the sports trophy has gained
added importance among the fra-

as an indication of the spirit and

DEFENSE SECRETARY CHARLES WILSON

Blunt Remarks Are Refreshing
Relief From Spineless Mumbling

“He is a blunt man. He speaks
what he thinks. He more or less
always has. Most of the time what
he thinks is true.”

In this manner last week Mrs.
Charles E. Wilson summed up her
husband, the Secretary of Defense.
Secretary Wilson has gotten him-
self once again into hot water for
giving vent to his feelings when
perhaps it would have been more
politic to have kept his mouth
shut.

DRAFT DODGING

On Monday of last week Secre-
tary Wilson while appearing be-
fore a Congressional committee
stated that the National Guard
during the Korean war was a “sort
of scandal” because it was used by
some enlistees for draft-dodging
purposes. Reaction was immediate
from the citadels of National

Guardism across the country.
Major General E. A. Walsh went

so far as to eall Wiison’s state-
ment “a damn lie.”

This was not the first time that
“Engine” Charlie had stuck his
foot in his mouth. Once previous
Wilson brought the wrath of every
pedigreed dog owner in the coun-
try down upon him when he com-
pared unemployed workers to ken-
nel fed dogs. That time the matter
was of little consequence except
to those who thought their dog
had Been insulted.

FOR NEW LAW

This time, however, the situation
is different. The Department of De-

By CLAGETT TAYLOR

fense is now trying to get Congress
to require all National Guard en-
listees to put in six months basic
training duty upon joining up with
the Guard. The higher echelons of
the National Guard are opposed
to a change in the present law be-
cause the new provision would
hurt enlistments, they say. Secre-
tary Wilson’s statement will sure-

lie, is that you say what you
think.”—Herblock in the Wash-
ington Post.

ly make it all the more difficult
to get a change in the law through
Congress because Wilson will now
have all the big guns of the Guard
trained on him. It must be remem-
bered that every Congressman has
many constituents who are mem-
bers of the Guard.

This then is the reason President

Eisenhower in his press confer-
ence last week said that he did not

share Wilson’s opinion and that
his Secretary of Defense had made

“a very unwise statement.” A pub-
lic reprimand such as this is al-
most inconceivable. Certainly Sec-
retary + Wilson should be able to
expect the President to.be at
least neutral since Eisenhower has
recently gone so far out of his
way in backing up his Secretary of
State, who also has been having
a rough time of it.

ELEMENT OF TRUTH
It must be admitted that Sec.

-cretary Wilson's statement had an

element of truth in it. All of us
had friends who joined up with
the National Guard during the Ko-
rean war in hopes of escaping
active duty. Many of them, it is
true, were called up with their
units, but some succeeded in ‘their
purpose. Nevertheless, Charlie
should have held his tongue for
political reasons.

For the past four years Mr. Wil-
son has served ably and well as
Secretary of Defense. We hope
that he will be able to survive
once more the cries for his resigna-
tion. It is nevertheless gratifying
to know that there are still men
in government who say what they
think as compared to those who
mince meaningless words.

During the past four years we
have been pleasurably diverted
many times by the big business
executive turned government ad-
ministrator who speaks his mind
in some of the most picturesque
language being used in govern-
ment circles today.

This respect for the trophy and
enthusiasm for the intramural pro-
gram is good and a healthy sign
of student body spirit. For this
very reason it seems that the
possession of the trophy should be
decided on the field of competi-
tion where the winning fraternity
can fairly demonstrate that it had
more teamwork, spirit and desire
to win than any other.

With the purpose in mind of
having the winner decided by
actual competition, I purpose two
rule changes. First, the ‘Varsity
Competition” category. should be
moved from the heading “Major
Sport” 10 the heading “Minor
Sport.” This would reduce the
number of points from 100 to 60
awarded the fraternity with the
highest percentage of varsity ath-
letes,

Second, I would purpose that
under no circumstances should the
possession of the trophy be de-
cided by points gained through
varsity competition. All points
should be counted in determining
which two fraternities place first
and second in the intramural com.
petition.

Then these two should subtract
from their respective totals the
points gained from varsity compe-
tition. The actual possession of the
trophy should then be decided on
points gained only through compe-
tition.

It would seem that this com-
promise offers enough reward for
varsity competition to encourage
the ‘fraternities to urge their men
to stay out for varsity sports, while
at the same time allowing trophy
possession to be decided only by
actual competition.

LETTER TO EDITOR

“Baby Doll” Editorial
Misses The Point

Dear Editor,

Because I have some regard for
Mr. Howell's opinion on matters
both social and aesthetic, I read his
comment on the widely discussed
“Baby Doll” with interest. Now
i think that there is much to criti-
cize in this movie, and yet I be-
lieve Mr. Howell's criticism com-
pletely misses the point.

First, it is ridiculous to say,
that this is not a true picture of
the South; of course it is not, and
it was not the picture’s purpose
to “paint a picture that speaks
of the whole South in terms of
illiteracy; intolerance, and sensual-
ness.” Both Williams and Kazan
realize that the situation present-
ed is only a very small segment of
the Southeastern region . .

Second, how anyone could think
that this film was intended to
“handle the epic of change and
progress” is beyond my under
standing ... . The fact of the
matter is that the movie is not
concerned with this subject, but
it reveals life in a situation which
though admittedly a typical and
unrepresentative of the South as
a whole, is nevertheless existent
in a few remote oreas ,..

Third, I was surprised to find
that four times in his article Mr.
Howell reveals a rather childish
sentiment found in some Southern
people which might be generally
expressed: “Why doesn’t the North
go away and leave us alone.” .. .

Since dormitory regulations spe-
cifically prohibit firecrackers, and
Davidson students are, without ex-
ception, gentlemen who obey all
college regulations in the manner
of gentlemen, we have been at a
loss to discover the whys and
wherefores of the sharp reports
and strange explosions which have
occasionally resounded down
dormitory row during the past
semester.

A more thorough investigation
of the matter has revealed the fol-
lowing sources of these weird
noises:

(1) Cop Linker dropped his
flashlight. (2) The M & M received
a shipment of popsicles with ex-
ceptionally strong bags. (3) Exces-
sive static on Radio Free David-
son. (4) One gentleman slapped
his roommate (with the utmost tact)
for the latter’s snide remarks con-
cerning the former’s current fi-
ancee. (5) The expansion and con-
traction of the steam pipes on the
fourth floor of the new (and still
nameless) domitory.

Despite agitation on the
part of some student leaders
for a campus post office, many
of the considerations which
prevented such a move in the
first place would seem as ap-
plicable now as they were sev-
eral years ago.

ever, I again question the rele-
vance of the criticism to its sub-
ject ..

. “Baby Doll” presents a
sorry, low view of mankind and
then attempts to gloss it over and
make us feel that all of it is good;
had Mr. Howell directed his criti-
cisms in this direction rather than
needlessly defending the South
against non-existent “slaps”, the
title of the article (BABY DOLL—
MUCH BULL) might have had at
least a small amount of justifica-
tion. Charlie Helms

already has boxes for students;
their installation in the union
would be needless and expensive
duplication of facilities.

Secondly, such an enterprise
would entail the use of stu-
dent workers during their off-
hours. This raises the possi-
bility that mail service might
not be as efficient, nor as fre-
quent as it is now.

Unless a full-time postal clerk
were employed for the sale of
stamps, money orders, etc., fre-
quent trips to the P.O. downtown
would stil! be necessary.

Finally, the additional handling
of mail would not only be time-
consuming, but would be a need-
less duplication of effort, in that
the post office downtown would
still have to sort and sack the
mail for further sorting and dis-
tribution by workers in the pro-
posed union post office.

in view of these considera-
tions, it would seem that the
status quo in this case is some-
what more satisfactory than it
is in other areas of compus
fife, such as the lack of holi-
days between semesters, or
regulation enforcement on the
campus. Perhaps the members
of the student council would
do well to devote thelr time
and energies to these more
fundamental problems.
