Needed: Student Representation

Perhaps the most significant of
the myriad of political promises and
proposals swirling about during last
week’s campus presidential campaign
was Wyche Fowler's plan to “agitate
for student representation on every
faculty committee involving student
affairs.”

This is a progressive, urgently
needed, and not-impractical sugges-
tion.

Since the Student Council voted
to lift the albatross of drinking rule
enforcement off its own shoulders and
hang it around the faculty's neck. at
least one faculty committee has been
in grave need of student representa-
tion.

The drinking problem now sits
squarely in the lap of the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities. Clubs and
Social Life, a group that has had to
be quite active this year.

This is not to say that the com-
mittee is incapable of doing its job

by itself — that it needs help from |

the students. But we do feel that the
committee could get the job done
quicker, more realistically and more
fairly if it had accurate information
on student feelings and- conditions
surrounding student problems.

The way to better information is
not through an occasional meeting
with IFC members. The way is through
permanent student representation on
the committee. As Fowler said, this
representation ‘would be for purposes
of communication and not for a voting
voice.

And why does the committee

Is The Court Dead?

Yesterday when the student body
passed the revised Student Body Con-
stitution, many students thought they
had voted to kill the Court of Control.
But is the Court of Control dead?

At present we do not think so.

Section 5 of the new By-Laws
says that the Freshman Court will be
composed of the Freshman Adviser,
who will be the judge of the court,
and seven members selected by the
Student Council. This Freshman Court
will “hear, investigate, and deal with
charges of upperclassmen against
Freshmen exhibiting improper con-
duct, violating the Freshman Regula-
tions, or breaking the traditions of the
College.”

There is no difference between
the new Freshman Court and the
“Court of Control, except that the

Freshman Advisor is now head of.

the court. What assurance do we have
that the rising Senior Class will not
elect_a Freshman Advisor who favors
hazing. chapel call-downs. and severe
punishments? ,

The Invisible Man

George Trask did Wednesday
what no student at Davidson College
has done before oy is likely to do
again.

He won the presidency of a stu-
dent body of which he is not a mem-
ber. He won from a distance of some
4000 miles. He won without answering
a question or defending a policy.

According to the new student
body constitution that was approved
yesterday — a constitution which he
planned and constructed himself —
George Trask will not legally be presi-
dent of the student body when he is
“{naugurated.” As a matter of fact, he
will not even be a member of the Stu-
dent Council.

For George Trask’s constitution
says that no student who withdraws
from the college for any reason can
be a member of the Student Council.

We trust that by a series of
bureacratic manueverings likely to be
understood only by incumbent presi-
dent Henry Shue, George Trask will
somehow be allowed to garb himself
in the mantle of authority without any
legalistic impedimenta. That’s O.K.
with us.

The point we’re trying to make is
this:

need information? Simply because
most of its members have never been
to an after-dance party, have a rather
distorted view of what goes on at
these parties, and have little concep-
tion of the mess that would result
if action were taken to curfew or
chaperone these functions.

The Faculty Fraternity Committe
is not the only group that needs stu-
dent representation, although the con-
sequences of not having student
representation are more severe in
this case.

We would add to the list Com-
mittees on the College Union, Debat-
ing and Dramatics, Artist Series and
Public Lectures, and Religious Life.

Presently only one group classi-
fied under “Committees of the Fac-
ulty” has student representation. This
is the Publications Board. which even
has a student chairman. Student par-
ticipation here has certainly not been
detrimental. .

Student-Faculty relations at Da-
vidson are excellent — when the
relationships exists on an individual
basis. But when groups of students
and groups of faculty try to negotiate,
they often seem separated by some
high, cold barrier. It is almost as if
the old-fashioned relationship of the
austere headmaster and the prank-
playing schoolboy still exists. °

The only way to solve the prob-
lem is to get the relationship back on
an individual basis. And the only way
to do this is have permanent student
representation where student matters
are concerned.

We have no assurance.

Thus, the Student Council should
deal a final death blow to the Court
of Control before the election of the
Freshman Advisor.

Section 5 of the By-Laws should
be changed to state specifically that.
no freshman will be called before the
court during a chapel program, all
punishments will be of a constructive
nature, and the length of the enforce-
ment period will not exceed six
weeks.

The only justification for having
a Freshman Court is that it can
counsel freshmen and help them to ad-
just to college life. The court should
not intimidate freshmen and only
discipline them when absolutely neces-
sary.

Article X of the. new constitution
gives the Student Council more-power
to place constructive legislation in the
By-Laws. We urge the Council to act

immediately.
R.LM.

The student. body of Davidson
College has made a long gamble on
an invisible man.

We are gambling that George
Trask will be able to grasp the reins
of. student government in September
and spur his steed into a gallop. He
will need to gallop because he will
have lost an entire month of valuable
experience this spring.

We are gambling that George
Trask will be good -— good enough to
revive in September a governing body
that has lain dormant since April.

When we make this gamble we
are trusting the invisible man to be
mature, rational and progressive. He
has undertaken an obligation.

We have no reason. to fear that
he will not be able to fulfill his
obligation.

In his campaign speech in ab-
sentia, Trask linked himself with a
Student Council that, among other
constructive accomplishments, “‘re-
vamped the Court of Control in favor
of a more mature, realistic approach
toward the entering freshmen.’

___.lf he conducts his administration
in keeping. with this tone. we're all
for him.

The gamble will have paid off.

while suggestion, put for-
ward by candidate Wyche
Fowler, received only scat-
tered attention: He suggested
that students and the council
should develop a sense of
responsibility in higher edu-
cation.

MEET CHALLENGE

Historian H. G. Wells once
wrote: “Human history be-
comes more and more a race
between education and catas-
trophe.” The threat of nu-
clear warfare and the Rus-
sian Sputnik have driven
Wells’ message home with
force. We must meet the
Russian challenge in the
realm of ideas, and we must
discover a way to control
forever the tremendous de-
structive power, which we
ourselves have created.

As President Kennedy put

Misinformed .........

forth so forcefully during
his campaign, wé must strive
for excellence, both individ-
ually and as a nation, in
order to measure up to the
challenge of our age. We
must prepare ourselves for a
world in which, as Thornton
Wilder said, “every good and
excellent thing . ... stands
moment by moment on the
razor-edge of danger and
must be fought for.”

AWARENESS

With an awareness of these
challenges has come a great
increase of interest in educa-
tion. In the past four years,
there have been published
an array of reports on educa-
tion. All of these sources
have arrived at the same con-
clusion: our schools must
provide better education for
larger numbers of students.

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS

Dear Editor:

I think that the second
paragraph of last week's edi-
torial. ‘On Campus Reac.
tion,” by Tommy Colvin was-
unnecessary, unethical, and
once, untrue.

How did Mr. Coivin know
that Dan LaF ar was “imagina-
tive’ when he was a high
school student during LaFar’s
term of office? Lf he relied
on what others had told him
about LaFar, as seems prob-
able, then he is guilty of
what I consider to be shabby
journatism.

The DAVIDSONIAN fails
in its position of “The
News and Editorial Voice
of Davidson College” when
evidently assumed know-
ledge is used in order to
prove a point.

The most glaring violation
of ethics and truth was when
he termed Dee Green as
“ineffectual.” Since I have
been at Davidson the most
worthwhile improvement in
the honor system came last
year under Green’s leader-
ship when the way was
opened for students expelled
for an honor offense to re-
turn. I doubt if the student
who returned this year as
a result of this change thinks
Green was “ineffectual.”

Green was quite active also
in having the after-dance
party pledge by fraternity
presidents deleted from the
Student Body Regulations.
These are, among others,
two reasons why I do not
think he was “ineffectual”
as Colvin claims.

{ think thet the pere-
oreph wes unnecessary be-
cause it was unrelated to
Colvin’s hope for mature
judgement in elections. |
think that it was unethical!
because it iudsed when

such judgment was un.
necesfary and especially
because. two past presi-
dents were needlessly
judged unfavorably.

Final’y, I cannot help won-
dering’ if Mr. Colvin ever
asked “well-intentioned” Ross
Smyth or “ineffectual” Dee
Green if he could be of any
help to them, or if he ever
showed them a way to better
perform their duties.

Dear Editor:

Hugh Cannon's speech last
week. was vaguely reminis-
cent of Dr. Martin’s speech to
the faculty last fall. After
Martin’s speech we expected
shortly some announcement
of a special, permanent fac-
ulty committee to study ideas
related to the tutorial system.
Of course the administration
could never admit any faults
within the current classroom
approach, but their interest
in continued improvement
is foregone.

Now we must admit that
the lengthy applause given
Cannon by the student
body was probably indica-
tive more of disapproval of
the current system than
enthusiasm over Cannon’s
proposals.

Discontent among students
is probably selfish (though
Mr. Currie evidently thinks
we have a group of little
demi-gods running around’ in
our dorms), although a few
freshmeh may not yet be
snowed by the volume of fact
assimilation.

As for the professor’s
salaries, we didn’t know
we were so pitifully poor.
It’s amazing that we have
no faculty committee seek-
ing federal aid (on their
own behalf). But then,
$10,000/year would prob-
ably exasperate a David-
son professor beyond rep-
aration. Maybe we could
undertake a 20-year plan
to raise salaries in line
with good conservative,
southern policy.

We're sure that the trus-
tees will come up with an
alternate plan when academic
changes prove unacceptable.
Perhaps the next building
will be an observatory, or
another ROTC headquarters.
Maybe we ‘can improve the
liberal aspects of our liberal
education by adding some
more inspiring required
courses.

We have confidence that
we can continue to have a
strong faculty drawn from
Wildcat Club ranks.

ON Top SS Liat XGHTISE..
YOU SHC. 3 CAIS 22 S275!

Our leading educators and
politicians have outlined the
goals which we must meet
within the next ten years.
Response to the call for sup-
port of educaton has come
from many sectors of Ameri-
can life. The philanthropist,
industry, the Church, govern-
ment, the P. T. A. — these
are some of the groups that
are beginning to take steps to
bring education up to the
standards it must meet in
order for us to continue to
face up to the challenges of
our times.

Perhaps, as students, we
should stop to investigate
our role in all of this, for,
indeed, if anyone should be
interested in education, it
should be us.

It has often been said that
one of the functions of educa-
tion is to provide the country
with responsible citizens.
Thus, we should accept some
responsibility in the present
campaign to improve educa-
tion in the country.

We bear not only individ-
ual responsibility, but also
corporate responsibility. As
individuals, we should try to
display an “authentic concern
for excellence.” As a student
body. we should do our part
in improving the quality of
education here at Davidson.

COUNCIL ROLE,

Last year, there was a great
deal. of concern about Da-
vidson’s educational stand-
ards, but it took the form of
bitter criticism rather than
constructve action. The Stu-
dent Council, through re-
sponsible leadership, could
play an important role in im-
proving Davidson's educa-

tional standards.

Instead of scattered, indi-
vidual criticisms ‘and sugges-
tions ,the student body would
provide the college with a
comprehensive picture of
student opinion on the sub-
ject. Moreover, the diverse
student views would be dis-
tilled and closely examined
in order to come up with the
soundest and most mature
student opinion.

FOWLER SAID

Candidate Fowler in the
statement circulated around
the campus the night before
voting began had the follow-
ing to say: “Here is an era
which could be tremendously
expanded at Davidson. These .
are not all innovations neces-
sarily, but are programs
which could be_ enacted
through student-faculty will-
ingness and cooperation: (1)
Qualified students. should
assist in procurement trips to
high schools, selling the stu-
dent viewpoint of college .. .
(2) Sponsor student forums
on pertinent issues to the
college, such as teacher eval-
uation for the administration,
curriculum changes, etc... .
(3) Sponsor and/or coordi-
nate extra-curricular educa-
tional projects: campus for-
ums, films, exchange pro-
grams, lectures, ete.”

" By activity of this sort, the
Student Council would be
concerned not only with the
drudgery of legislation, but
also with the very innards of
an educational institution.
As an issue which concerns
the country, Davidson Col-
jege and the student, him-
self, it is an area which can
ill-afford to be overlooked.

The Doubtful Rumors
Hint Rusk Will Resign

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Why all the whispers about Dean Rusk?
President Kennedy’s Secretary of State — and |
Davidson’s present most illustrious alumnus — is a
retiring man who seems to shun publicity.
He hasn't been making much news — since he
is not given to speech-making or globe-trotting —
and his public statements are mild, guarded, almost

prosaic.

His actions and statements as a public figure

haven't been “good copy.”

Could this be why the news magazines print hints
of conflict and dissension in Mr. Rusk’s department.
“news” of dissatisfaction on the part of the Secretary?

Most often they are stories of conflict with Adlai

Stevenson.

in the early days of the Kennedy administration,

U. S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT stated that
Stevenson had shrugged off his new boss as merely

“a technician and a bureaucrat.”
The story was hotly denied by Stevenson, but
U. S. N. & W. R. stuck to its guns, publishing the
next week.a full account of Stevenson’s alleged com-
ment to “‘a European diplomat.”

There have even been statements that Rusk

and Kennedy are at odds.

HUMAN EVENTS, a conservative Washington
newsletter which seems to dislike Rusk without really
knowing why (perhaps it’s a matter of guilt-by-associa-
tion: Rusk was once close to Dean Acheson), reported
in a recent issue that Rusk is bothered by Kennedy’s
practice of having returning diplomats report to the
White. House first, and not to their immediate superior

at State.

In addition, it is said that Rusk resented bitterly

Kennedy's recent surprise visit to a State Depart-
ment briefing — observing that it was unprece-
dented; the Secretary, hinted HUHAN EVENTS,
doesn’t like to be checked upon too closely.

The writers recall Rusk’s statement at his Senate
confirmation hearing: a flat, “I shall be in charge of
the State Department.” They point out that Rusk now
may be irritated at the lack of autonomy he is being
given by the President, who wants to guide depart-

ment policy personally.

Small wonder that U. S. NEWS and HUMAN
EVENTS are both betting money that Rusk will be the
first high official to leave the Kennedy administration.

Both have predicated it, and HUMAN EVENTS,
referring to Rusk as “the cautious old bureaucrat,”
observes that Rusk has not retired from the Rockefeller
Foundation: he is-on an indefinite leave of absence
granted by the Foundation, ensuring him a place with
the Foundation should he quit his Washington duties.

The stories are, of course, undocumented. They

may be true, or they may

have only a kernel of truth

dressed in speculation, like most gossip.

Chances are, when the Secreta

begins his

traveling to conferences, when he makes a speech
or a dramatic announcement, or when he is at the
helm of the State Department in a red-hot crisis, -
the whispers will stop and the news will begin: the
tty will give away to the momentous.
It probably won't be long.

YOU GOT IT WCNG,
KID...ALL WRONG...
