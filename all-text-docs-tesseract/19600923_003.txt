‘I'm Not Your Daddy’

WILL THE REAL Coach Tom Stevens please stand
up? Mrs. Stevens brought two toddlers to watch the
Wildcats practice Tuesday. When it was all over, her
little boy ran up to a man in bermuda shorts and clutched
his leg. A flabbergasted Dwight Shoe leaned down to
say, “I’m not your Daddy.”

A VOTE of confidence must go out to the varsity for
its performance last weekend. Catawba was stopped
cold by Dole’s well-oiled defensive machine on its trial
run. The Indians could not sustain a single drive. Their
only scoring came on a surprise 54-yard pass play. Five
Catawba first downs told the story.

PERHAPS the final chapter of another story was
written—attendance. Less than 3,000 people saw the
game in Charlotte's mammoth Memorial Stadium. David-
son Athletic Director Tom Scott—one of the faithful few
—promptly served notice that the Queen City may have
forfeited its only college football attraction.

Dole’s Arm Reaches Far—And Near

A YOUNG man said Goodbye to the Ole Miss Rebels
after his freshman year in 1955. This year he told Uncle
Sam the same thing, Bill Dole listening in on the conver-
sation. His name is Joe Jones. He’s a sophomere here.
And he’s ineligible to play ‘till next fall.

ANOTHER young man decided to stay home and play
for his Dad, William E. Dole Jr., a 215-pound tackle on
the freshman team. He made quite a name for himself
down the road at North Mecklenburg High School. .

WE TOLD you’ last week about the sign—Basketball
Coach—we saw on the door of Charles Driesell’s office.
The other day we peeked inside. A carpet, no less.

AND THE pipe-smoking president of the Southern
Conference has trimmed his locks, in case you haven’t
noticed. Frontis Johnston, dean of the Davidson Faculty,
we mean.

Hold Your Horses, Boys

THE ADJECTIVE “big” attached to the coaching |
change to be announced in January perhaps is mislead-
ing. It won’t shake the rafters, by any means.

WORD COMES that a 115-pound sophomore has the
boots scared off two mainstays of the Davidson cross-
country team. Sterling-Martin, the unicycle rider, is push-
ing Bill Eckbert and Dave Gilmour for the top position.
It's all for the Alma Mater, though.

DURING THE past two years we’ve heard a lot about ,
the lack of communication and cooperation between stu-
dents ard faculty. At the same time, however, we've wit-
nessed a goodly number of the professors at athletic
events—in the stands, at the official’s table, on the
coach’s bench. Students might do well to appraise their |
own participation.

Outside The Chinese Wall

HERE FOLLOW excerpts of a report on football,
problems by Bob Kane, director of athletics at Cornell
University:

“Cornell has the largest athletic program in the coun-
try, with 21 varsity and 18 freshman sports. We are
blessed with a superb plant, many of the finest facilities
made possible by the generosity of our alumni. . . His-
torically the basic source of revenue for the support of
intercollegiate athletics has been football receipts. Late-
ly expenses are multiplying as football income has been
diminishing. This creates a budgetary predicament .. .
The big problem is finances. Football is the only bread-
winner and there has been a successful effort to de-pres-
surize it. So it is not now winning nearly its former share
of break. . .

“There is nothing wrong with football. It is a magnif-
icent game which can do important things for this uni-
versity, as it used to. It brings back more: alumni than
any other event. It has emotional appeal which is stimu-
lating . . . I am profoundly disturbed by its fall from
importance in our Cornell scene. Footbali will be a fac-
tor in American lives as long as young college boys have
muscles and a sense of adventure and daring. It will
draw watchers as long as it is played. The number of
watchers will depend on how well and how interestingly
it Is played.

“Our football is planned mediocrity, an anachronism
in our otherwise excellence-minded society. Some day
perhaps the opportunity to practice and improve will be
more advantageous in the Ivy League and crowds will
come back.”

SOPHOMORE TRIED

The new defense - minded
brand of ball introduced by the
Wildcats this fall necessitated
the changing of several experi-
enced baeks to the defensive
unit and left pressure on un-
tried sophomores. ’

In the hands of such as Bob
Cordle the Davf&dson offense
certainly should not suffer.

Bob Scores 100 As Wildcats Pass Test

Bob graduated from  Char-
lotte’s Myers Park High School
in 1959 with letters in all four
major sports, including two in
football.

Last year he was one of the
outstanding members of the
freshman football team and al- |
so earned his freshman letter
in track. Here he was hampered
by bone chips in his ankle

which kept him under wraps

during the spring football prac-
tice.

But Bobby Cordle is going
full speed now, and it should
be good enough to give David-
son football fans quite a few
eye-openers during the course
of this, the 1960 season.

S. C., on October 6.

Wildcats will have a bright col- |

Wofford Terriers. The kickoff, slated for 8:00 p.m. mit
begin the twenty-fourth gridiron battle between the two
schools in a series that began back in 1914.

Since that opening contest,

quarterback slot will be Benny
Coxton, a 5°11" 184-pounder
from Raven, Va.

The full back slot is con-
tested between Jim Fuller of
High Point and Barry Bili-
ington of Fort Gordon. Ful-

East-West duel at Greens-
boro.

Lyle Blalock, 5'10" and 176

West veteran from Winston-
Salem, and Dave Lopp from
Lexington, will be the probable
starters at the halfback posts.
Backing them up in the back-
field wilk be Jim Killebrew,
Bob Bost and Luther Hutchens.

Freshman Coach Tom Stevens
predicts that this backfield will
“go places with some good
blocking up front.”

That “good blocking” will
be furnished by a host of

Jim Rhyne of Charlotte and
Richard Booth will alternate
with Ed Rude.

"Cats Added D And 0,
Did Sumpin’ To Catawha

A Charlotte reporter summed up the Davidson-Catawba game last Saturday
when asked who was looking good for the Indians. “The cheerleaders,’ he replied.
To all intents and purposes that was it, though Catawba'’s Gene Worthington
gave the ‘Cats quite a battle from his single wing, halfback slot.

Davidson's defensive unit— 1959 after an opening win over
notably End Booker Clark, the Indians, 42-6.

Twenty-nine men had a hand
in the victory.

Coach Bill Dole, three days
before the game, faced a di-
lemma. His number one and

two fullbacks—Bob- McAllister
and Carl Hunt—werc ailing.
Scrambling around for another
man, he found Junior Lynwood

With less than two weeks remaining before the first

day against the Wildcats. Depth
in the interior line is somewhat
of a problem for the Terriers,
but they have several big, young
boys that need only game ex-
perience.
LEARN BY LOSS

The Lenior-Rhyne game may
have provided that needed ex-
perience,

As Coach Dole summed up
the Wofford gridders, “They're
big, fast, and can throw that
football. This is one of the fin-
est teams Wofford has had in
several years.”

As for Davidson's strategy
and personnel, both should re-
main about the same as last
weekend. Once again, the ’Cats
will rely on a quick offense
and an air-tight defense.

Three Men Vie
For Two Posts

By CARL RUST
Davidsonien Sports’ Writer

This year the Davidson

cut short of men by graduation, meets a tough eight-
game schedule, including Wake Forest, Citadel and V.P.1.

Coach Whittle feels sure that
the cross country men can cap-
ture five of these eight meets.
The first foe — Pembroke will
be here next Friday.

NO DOUBT NOW

Last year there .was consid-
erable doubt whether Eckbert
would be able to play. However,
it has been confirmed that he
will be eligible and ready to
go against Pembroke.

Along with Eckbert, Whittle
is expecting a great deal from
David Gilmour. Last year David
was tied up with labs and
eouldn’t get going. But the
story has changed and so far
this year David hes been look-
ing good.

FROSH SHINE

Sterling Martin and Laureace
Leafer, the one and two men on
last year’s freshman team, are
back and both have been doing
an exceptionally fine job.

Also Thompson, the team cap-
tain, and Tom Martin should
be a tremendous help this year.
All these men will be in ‘there
fighting for the first five po
sitions on the team.

THREE FOR TWO

Whittle stated that the sum-
ber one and two sports are still

undecided. The battle to see 'perciassmen.

College cross-country team,

who gains possession of these
spots will be between Eckbert,
David Gilmour, and Sterling
Martin.

Whittle seemed very pleased
in his outlook for this season.

He said that he has a fine
group of boys to work with,
and when asked how they were
coming along he responded,
“The boys are working hard
but won't be in top shape for
the Pembroke meet. However,
they should be ready for Wake
Forest since they are making
rapid progress.”

Quarterback Tee Redding
showed the marks of practice.

Last year il was not uncom-
mon to hear that Redding, un-
derstudy to southpaw Charlie
Benson, couldn't pass. He dis-
pelled all doubts Saturday night,
hitting Halfback Danny House
for 19 yards to set up the Wild-
eats’ first touchdown. Moments
later he pitched one 16 yards
to Lou Zirkle in the end zone.
“THE BULLET”

Most exciting from the side-

“The Bullet" Bob Cordle. The

season.

With 13 lettermen returning
from last year’s squad, ‘Mar-

at least match last year’s 7-3

However, Coach Marrotte
emphasizes that “under no

ply because we have 12 or 13
lettermen returning. |! must
say that I’m not particularly

Coach Marrotte also pointed

There was a minimum of mis-

the second half, but it was a,
