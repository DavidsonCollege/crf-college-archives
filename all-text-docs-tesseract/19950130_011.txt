Ansel Adams exhibition
gives new perception of natural beauty

By George Weld

When you walk into the Ansel
Adams art exhibit (and you should)
in the Van Every Gallery, you will
be struck by a series of strange
sensations.

Your first impression will be
that you have seen the photographs
before: Adams is the most famous
and most published American pho-
tographer. Your second sensation
will be feeling that you have never
seen these particular images be-
fore. There is something mysteri-
ously and powerfully different
about seeing Adams’ photographs
as prints rather than as reproduc-
tions.

You may also have a third
sensation, as I had, that Adams’
pictures are not merely photo-
graphs by “The Man Who Cap-
tured the Earth’s Beauty,” as the
title of this show puts it, but the
work of a man who perceives and
understands the earth’s beauty.
Anyone who has driven through
the mountains and the deserts of
New Mexico, Arizona, and Cali-
fornia has seen the actual land-
scapes of Adams’ magisterial and
majestic compositions. His photo-

_ graphs have defined as much of the
American West as: they have de-
fined American photography.

Adams’ most defining works
are represented by this show. The
back two rooms of the gallery are
filled with the familiar Moon and
HalfDome, Yosemite; Sand Dunes,
Sunrise, Death Valley; Monolith,
the Face of Half Dome and others
of Adams’ famous modernist land-
scapes. They are imposing and
austere, combining the spare com-
posed beauty of Japanese artists
such as Hokusai with an American
grandiosity.

Some other pictures include
Old Faithful captured mid-gush,
the Tetons in a gnarled and rocky
relief against the sky, and the se-
vere El Capitan. These images
belong to the well known Adams:
the cool, epic, and bold Adams.

But there are other, less famil-
iar photographs in this exhibition
which make the show even more
exciting. These prints reveal, in

addition to his epic vision, Adams’ .

sensitivity to detail.

viding a textured and playful con-
trast to the monolithic cliffs in the
background. Winter Sunrise, the
Sierra Nevada, from Lone Pine
California sets the tiny figure of a
lone cow against the Sierra
Nevadas. This detail is set not only
to contrast the cow and the peaks,
but also to lyricize the composi-
tion. The mountains we react to in
the only way we can — with awe.
The cow brings us into the picture
and gives us something more local
and available to relate to. This
show also includes a portrait of
Alfred Stieglitz, demonstrating that
Adams’ excellent photography
skills captured more than one sort
of stone face.

I can conceive of only one
valid excuse for missing “The Man
Who Captured the Earth’s Beauty”:
if you are passionately attached to
your Adams poster or your Sierra
Club calendar. ©

Your calender reproductions
will seem pallid when compared to
the actual prints. You may find
your passion-waning and your frus-
tration building not being able to
see Adams’ original prints every
day.

HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS.

The British

revisited: the Beatles are back

By Tom Bavis

Disc two of Live at the BBC
begins with Brian Matthew, host
of the early sixties radio show “Top
Gear,” saying, “The next few min-
utes are in the lap of the gods and
the hands of the Beatles.” In retro-
spect, his off-hand segue rings of
prophecy. In the course of over
two hours of music and chatter that
comprise Live at the BBC, the
Beatles sound divinely touched,
spinning out performance after in-
Spiring performance.

As aBeatles fan, I gotnervous
when I heard that EMI/Capitol
planned to release old radio show
performances in anticipation of the
Beatles release blitz planned for
1995. If these performances were
any good, wouldn’t they have re-
leased them already? The
unreleased archives of every other
larger-than-life sixties icon has
long since been exhausted (“Hey
boss, here’s a recording of Jimi
burping we haven’t put out yet’).
The last EMI/Capitol release of
previously unheard Beatles was a
concert recording with more crowd
noise than music.

I joined millions of Beatles
fans in a collective sigh of relief
and an occasional smile when I
heard Live at the BBC for the first
time. The 56 early performances
cleverly fade into each other or
into one of the 13 segments, of
studio chatter, much like a radio
show. The mono (and often shock-
ingly lo-fi) nature of the record-
ings take nothing away from the
spirit of the songs. Actually, the
spontaneously warm, wall-of-
sound BBC performances provide
a refreshing escape from the rela-
tively sterile, perfectionist record-
ings of today. Even digital repairs
and CD technology could not take

these recordings out of the Sixties,
and they are all the better for it.
The first CD starts with the
Beatles introducing themselves and
breaking into a brief, aptly re-
worded “From Us to You.” The

disc then builds to an early climax -

with “Some Other Guy.” Few

overloads because they play so
much louder than expected. When
John Lennon yells; “Some other

you can imagine the testosterone-
filled fistfighthe’s provoking. This
