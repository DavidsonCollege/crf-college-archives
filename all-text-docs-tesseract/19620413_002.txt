Conspiracy ‘Of The Right?

God knows, there is risk in re-
fusing to act till the facts are
all in: but is there not greater
risk in abandoning the condi-
tions of all rational cinquiry?
Risk for risk, for myself |. hed
rather take my chance that
some traitors will escape detec-
tion than spread abroad e spirit
of general suspicion and dis-
trust, which accepts rumor and
gossip in place of undismayed
and unintimidated inquiry:
believe that that community is
already in a process of dissolu-
tion where each man begins to
eye his neighbor as a possible |
enemy, where non-conformity
with the accepte@ creed, politi.
cal as well as religious, is a
mark of disaffection; where de-
nunciation, without specitica-
tion or backing, takes the place
of evidence; where orthodoxy
chokes freedom of dissent; *

Seven members of the Johri Birch
Society were on campus this week to *
see that Davidson College knows of
internal Communist conspiracy in the
United States. The Society’s literature
is on sale at the College Union: A for-
mer major general, turned Chicken
Little, last week extended the web of
conspiracy to ‘include Secretary of
State Dean Rusk. The alarmist, sky is
falling psychology of the entire ‘Far
Right” has been brought close ‘home
for the College. We feel compelled to
respond. .

Whatever the Birchers had to say
was said at Davidson in a manner for-,
eign to academia or rational discus-
sion of issues. Opinions masqueraded
as irrefutable dogma—accusations
were thrown out as if they were to be
accepted at face. value. without. ques-
tion. Schools, clergy, press and alf but
a few elected and appointed govern-
ment officials were seen as part of
the “conspiracy”’.

We found the Birchers assuming ~
a special factual knowledge of con-
spiracy and conspirators—“if you only
knew what I know, you'd be an alarm-
ist too.” Challenged on their “facts”
they could do nothing more. than re-
peat opinions and theories based on
guilt by association. They often failed
to understand questions directed at
their dogmatic assertions. -

Their only “political” unity is
found in a program of “education and

Credit ..

The Student Council took a long-
needed step last Wednesday when it
created the Student Activities Com-
mittee. That certain organizations
have not, at best, been active in ful-
filling their potential roles in the cam-
pus community life has been appar-
ent for some time.

The main trouble is, of course,
that too many membership lists are
filled with ‘“‘club-collectors” who con-
tribute nothing except their names.
And the organization, in‘turn, contri-
butes its name to the achievement list
for the individual in Quips and Cranks
and on graduate school applications.

This inactive majority has had a
tendency to stifle organizations having
the best intentions with an atmos-
phere of apathy. Leadership has too
often become a matter of entailing
prestige but little real service.

If the Activities Committde lives
up to its stated purposes it can pro-
vide significant stimulation where
needed and, hopefully, bring clubs to
the point where they exist for more
than their own sake. Organizations,
such as the literary societies, should
be encouraged to present certain pro-
grams open to and benefiting the en-
tire student body.

We would like to see this commit-
tee become one of the more active on
campus. It has the potential of being
a most important area of student-
faculty cooperation. Aims of each seg-
ment can be presented and fused to
provide certain agreed-upon goals

where faith in the eventual su-
premacy of reason has become
so timid that we dere not enter
our convictions in the open lists,
to win or fose. Such fears as
these are a solvent which can
eat out the cement that binds
the stones together; they may
in the end subject us to se
. despotism as evil as any we
dread; and they can be alleyed
only in so far as we refuse to
proceed on suspicion, and trust
one another until we have tangi-
ble ground for misgiving. The

a pre-FDR economy—as they say it,
“getting the socialists out of the gov-
ernment.” ;

The Birchers and their comrades
on the Right seem to be expressing an
emotional resentment and rebellion
toward the new twentieth century role
of the United States as world power
and, free world leader—and against
resulting economic and political re-
sponsibilities. They often seem to be
demanding an impossible return to
our protected, isolated nineteenth cen-
tury position.

The danger of the Far Right lies
not so much in ends as in means.
When an individual is accused of Com-
munist conspiracy before all the facts
are in, that individual becomes the
victim of the social irresponsibility of
his accusers. And his accusers become
very like those they presumably op-
pose.

The problem is posed for socially
responsible “Conservatives” and “Lib-
erals” alike: how far should such cru-
sading be allowed to go before it be-
comes libelous? When does freedom
of expression become anarchistic li-
cense? Seeds of doubt in some basic
values of our culture are being sown
in the minds and emotions of the un-
critical masses—-we could reap a
whirlwind of unforeseen and terrible
consequences.

which the entire campus community
can actively contribute to.

The mere fact that the committee
will probably be given the power of
granting permission to organizations
“to use the name of Davidson College
in its name or in any publicity” and
possibly some power in “activities
away from campus” signals a notable

advance in the realm of shared respon-:

sibility.

Where Credit Is Due

The fact that the creation of this
committee was one of the last major

George Trask should not be overlook. .

ed. In fact we would like to take this
opportunity to congratulate Trask as
he steps down.

Student activities,
and participation in off-campus con-
ferences have been three areas in
which the president himself has pro-
vided much of the initiative and car-
rying drive necessary for action. This
aspect plus his willingness to consider
and work for promising suggestions
has resulted in a singularly successful
year of Student Council activity.

We would like to think that the
applause in assembly Thursday, while
approving what was said, at least in
part expressed approval of the person

Former Student Relates
Outlook Of Ghanaians

BY KNOX ABERNETHY

I have long hesitated to write
anything to THE DAVIDSON-
LAN since I entered the Univer-
sity of Ghana in September. My
chief reason is that I shall un-
doubtedly be misunderstood
and, more important, ignored by
the people I hope to address.
But after perusing a few stray
issues which happened to stray
across the Atlantic, I feel com-
pelled to run the risk of open-
ing my mouth.

Some 750 Ghanaians have
seen fit to climb down out of
the trees to inhabit .a university,
which, in physical and academic
prowess rivals even Davidson.
Ninety percent of the students
are on full government scholar-
ship, which they repay by teach-
ing in the public schools or by
working in the civil service for
three to five years after grad-
uation. (The Ghana government
would rather use its university-
trained men in this way, than
put them in the army.)

STUDENTS CONSERVATIVE

On the whole, the students
are rather conservative, when
compared to the general trend
of political events and thought
in West Africa. But, from
what | have been able to gath-
er, they are quite typical in
their opinions of the educated
people of West Africa.

What about race problems?
To begin with, they are black
men. and black men don’t lke
to be treated like anima's. Un-
der British coloriial rule they
got enough of a taste of >: -
prejudice to assure themselves
that it’s not a “good thing,” and
they have remained miraculous-
ly free of racialism. There have
been enough American students
around to inform the Ghanaian
students fairly well.

COLD WAR

The people on the street:
however, aren't so well-in-
formed, end are not averse to
stopping Americans and de-
manding an explanation. They
are intensely interested In the
struggle of their “brothers” —

the Afro-Americans, as they
call them. And they are usual-
ly placated by the assurance
that “progress is being made.”
(Whether you really think it’s
progress or not, this is the
only patriotic explanation.)
The big issue for all Ameri-
eans discussing world affairs is,
of course, the Cold War. When-
ever any of the Americans here
slips into the usual diatribe a-
gainst commoani which. .we
take for grated athowe, the
students start to chuckle. The
Ghanaian image 6f the “typi-
cal American” is that of a very
wealthy lqud-mouth who calls
all his critics communists. They
expect our anti-communist prop-
aganda~and they get plenty of
it from the many: organs the
American government is em-
ploying to disseminate its views.
But while they are _ rather
cynical about fis American ob-

“sessfoh, the majority of them

are quite openly suspicious of
the Russians and critical of
their policies. The government
is hard pressed to find students
willing to accept the generous
scholamhips offered by Eastern
nations. The illiterates simply
don’t trust white en; 150
years of British taught
them better than that.
(Note: Russians are white.)
Those who are “in| the know”
realize many of the dangers of
communism, and their feelings
are intensif‘ed by the bungling
Russian aid programs.
NUCLEAR TESTS
When the Russians resum-
ed nuclear testing the stud-
ents were furious, but they
were more furious a couple of
years ago when the French
were testing bombs in the
Sahara desert—much closer
home then Siberia. At that
time the Western powers wore
very quiet about the sins of
nuclear tests. So, when the
West vehemently attecked
Russian tests, and at the same
time began conducting its
own, their indignation was
understandably decreased,
and their cynicism enhanced.

Africans view the present
world conflict rather different-
ly from ourselves. They regard
it as the struggle of freedom
against oppression, just as we
do. The difference is that’ they
don’t think that the communists
are the only oppressors. They
lived under British tyranny for
150 years (call it what you like,
it was still tyranny) in nearby
areas which seem far more im-
portant to Africans than to our-
selves. The Portugese are car-
rying out a policy of slave la-
bour and brutality which rivals
Red China in intensity, if not
in size.

in South Africa, perhaps a
dreamland for segregationists,
but the epitome of all that is
evil for Africans, the racial-
ist despotism of Verwoed and
Welensky are implemented by
“anti-communist” legislation.
The upholders of apartheid
equate all concepts of racial
equality and/or integration
with communism. (An attituda
not unknown in the South.)
In the Congo, Tshombe, whom
Ghanaians regerd as an arch-
fiend, duped the West with his
anti-communist pretenses.

AFRICANS QUESTION

In other words, all around
them, Africans see oppression
and brutality, and it’s largely
carried out in the name of com-
bating communism. This leads
them to ask, “What right do
you have to preach about free-

dom and justice when you and

your allies are oppressing our
brothers in America, in Algeria,
in Angola, and in South Africa?”

In conclusion, let me assure
you that Africans are not anti-
American or communist dupes.
Rather they are passionately op-
posed to tyranny in any form,
and are jealously guarding their
own newly-found freedom. If
someone is oppressing them or
their neighbors, they will ob-
ject. And even if that someone
is the West, they will still ob-
ject. Perhaps some of us or our
wisened politicians could profit
by this example.

Festival Features Short
Experimental Pictures

BY DAVID SIMPSON
Film Committee Chairman

On Tues. and Wed., April 18
and 19, the College community
will have a chance to see at
least six short films from
Cinema 16, the country’s oldest
and largest film society.

The “far-out films,” as Arthur
Knight of the Saturday Review
calls them, will be perhaps the
strangest lot of films offered at
Davidson in a long while.

There seems to be no middle
ground of opinion on the films.
Stanley Kauffmann of the New
Republic calls them “mostly
trash.” Jonas Mekas, film critic
for the Village Voiee and editor
of Film Culture reports: “In
American experimental-poetic
films, Stan Brakhage or Ken.
meth Anger could serve us as |
an example of the kind of mod- |
ern film poet who creates not
according to the technical rules |
of filmmaking (a la Spottis-
woode) but rather according to

the rules of his own subcon-
scious—that depth where real
creation begins.

And only with the cinema-
sense established at that
depth can we begin to hope
for the art of cinema to
emerge.”

What is an experimental film?
Arthur Knight in his book The
Liveliest Art, describes experi-
mental film thus: “Despite a
multiplicity of styles and in-
tentions, . . . experimental

work falls into two main cate-
gories—the abstract film, con-
cerned with color, form, texture,
movement and spatial relation-
ships . . . and the subjective
film, which is the story form of
the avant-garde—stories told
through the dream symbols and
Freudian trappings first intro-
duced on the screen by the sur-
realists of the twenties.”

The films are as “far-out”
from conventional cinema as

THE CONSERVATIVE MIND

Progressive Income Tax
Inclines Toward Marxism

BY CLAY ATKINS
e Conservative Club President

ver since the 1913 income tax amendment was
enacted has the government found a painless method of
collecting the tax. We realize that taxes must remain high
at the: present time to insure our country’s defense. But,
at the same time, we should realize that prudence is
needed to render the least damage to the economy in
leveling this tax. The progressive system of taxing is a
real threat to industry and to the aggressive drive that
has brought America to her present greatness.

he present tax system reduces the availability
of venture capital which no new dynamic industry
can afford to be without. The effect of this reduction
has been to downgrade personal incentive, individual
effort, and accomplishments.

i incredible paradox that as a peo le we place
extraordinary emphasis on achievement and admiration
for distinction. But when rewards of achievement are
paid in terms of dollars rather than cheers most people
cry, “no.” We admire success, but penalize the success-
ful; we admire talent, but penalize the talented; we ad.
mire leadership, but penalize the leaders. Cheers, “yes,
but financial rewards, “no.” Too little thought is given
to the moral implication of taxing one man's earnings”
more than another’s. This is equality?

re nearer the system of proportional tax than
we are led to believe. Studies show that our tax bill is
about 25 per cent of the value of the country’s productive
effort and that over all every citizen is paying nearly that
percentage of his own income. Yet, we are led to believe
that the greater part is collected from a handful of the
wealthy. Actually the excess of the 25 per cent is only
three per cent, which is about four per cent of the total
revenue. If the group earning $50,000 and up were strip-
ped of their total income, the results would searcely net
enough to operate the government for a single day!

In recent years Russia has realized the import-
ance of personal rewards. It is notable that at a time
when the Soviets are embracing our principle of in-
centive and show signs of their benefit, we ourselves
seem intent upon abandoning this principle. A free
society with incentives and rewards geared to per-
sonal accomplishment will produce a nation second
to none. We must return to the principles which have
brought us to our present high stature.

It has become a denial of the principle of high re-
wards for high accomplishment and a bowing to the
Marxian theory, “from each according to his ability; to
each according to his need.”

From the beginning, we have held fast to a set of
moral principles implicit in the tradition of individual
freedom. These principles have served us well. We know
that Marx listed the steeply graduated income tax sys-
tem as one of the 10 principal weapons of communism.
The evil of so gross a discrimination cannot fail to have
its effect upon our moral fiber. The effect on the present
and on the future cannot fail to be profound.

New United States?
European Disagrees

BY CONSTANTINE STATHATOS
Richardson Scholer

The prospective realization of the European Common
Market’s economic goals is unquestionably reasonable.
The “éxperts” have gone too far, however. They are
dreaming. not only of an economic boom, but also of a
general unification of the state-members following the
United States pattern. In fact, they expect in the very
near future the citizens of the nation-members to say no
more that they are Belgians or Italians, but to call them-
selves Europeans in the same sense that the New Yorkers
or the Texans say that they are Americans. In other words,
Europe is expected to become another United States.

DIFFERENCES EXIST

There is something visionary and chimerical in these
dreams, however. Nationalism exists in the European
states to the extent of extremeness. An Englishman or a
German, for instance, should never be e: ted to put
aside his nationalistic beliefs and call himself a European.
On the other hand, the idea that we can follow the
American pattern sounds utopistic. Let us not build
castles in the air.

It took a very long time for the United States to
substitute “is” for “are”. And, as far as I know, there are
still regional differences. There is North; ‘there is South. -
The unity of this country is not a mere product of good
will. The “Melting Pot” operated under peculiar cir-
cumstances. The newcomers had to adapt themselves to
a new environment. The need for adaptation brought
them close together. This togetherness, they felt, was a
matter of survival for themselves as well as their off-
spring. There was no other way to face the numerous
adversities they came across. As a result, the national
differences were abandoned.

DIVERSITY CITED

In present-day Europe things are quite different;
Europe is not being established! It is very old and there
are well-organized states with long traditions and lots of
differences which are insurmountable. The way of living,
the psychosynthesis, varies from country to country. It
goes without arguing that this diversity et less sharp
under the impact of the rising economy. It will never
disappear, though. The gaps are not easy to pave. ‘
