In order to create a larger inter-
est in the two major sports in the
“y,”” Murph Williams has not only
improved the equipment tremend-
ously but he has also appropriated
two handsome placques that will
be placed in the game rooms. The
Plaques will serve the purpose of
designating, in succee@ing years the
students most proficient in these
two sports—ping-pong and _ pool.
The single winners will be those
that are engraved upon the plaques.
{n this connection, Shaw will head
the ping-pong and Woodbridge will
be the first on the pool plaque.

clude Roger Scovil in the singles,

four out of the nine games played;
the Shaw-Moore combination took
three of the eight games against

We have heard it said that David- |

critical of fellow students; critical
of the faculty; and that our criti-
cism is frequently narrow and un-
just. We might pause for a moment
and ask ourselves if there is any

Davidson Delegation Enter-
tained by Westminster Girls

On Thursday, May 1, a delegation
| of twenty-fi¥e men responded to a
| gracious invitation on the part of
| the Westminster Fellowship Group
lof Winthrop College at Rock Hill,
The group was
composed of Eade Anderson, Al and
| Jack Bridgeman, Bill Baxter, Dud-
| ley Camper, Alf Duncan, Bill Hoyt,
| Sam Hoyt, Terrel Kirk, Rufus Long,
Sam Maloney, Walter Mann, Herb
Miller, Johnny Miller, Jack Payne,
| Frank Perrin, Bill Plonk, Walter
Snowden, Charles Turner, Dan Ty-
ler, Graham Whitney, Red Wil-
liams, Lee Williams, and Parks
Wilson.

They drove down in the after-
noon to the Oakland Avenue Pres-
byterian Church where all were
j warmly grected by attractive Pat
| Patterson, Student Director of the
Oakland Avenue Church, and Hilda
Procter, President of their local
group. After a few moments of
playing “Who do you know that I
know.?” all paired-off and went in
to a five o'clock supper. Toward
the end of the meal several of our
boys got together under the direct-
on of President-elect Lee Willing-
ham for a bit of harmony that was
surpassed only by their nerve.

The program consisted of an in-
formative talk on the very real
problem of world ferddation whieh
was interestingly presented by

| Reverend Howard Wilkinson, assist-

ant to Dr. Clovis Chappel at the
first Methodist Church of Char-
lotts. A discussion followed and

lassies, abiding by a seven-thirty
| curfew, scampered back to their
| dormitories.

What Can ra
Bad Christian Do With

Three Questions For

Monday Morning

Indeed,
he-never_even_used that expression,
him, ‘thé Sabbath not

under glass, about hich we must
tread soitly lest it be “broken.” On
the contrary, the Sabbath exists to
keep man from being broken. He
said plainly, The Sabbath was made

for man,

It is a mistake to interpret this
saying of Jesus in a non-Christian
sense. We must ask, What is man?
If man is (as is commonly supposed
people) only
more complicated animal, then the
Sabbath is to make us better ani-

by non-religious a

mals. But Jesus had a far different
view of man,

Suppose we take the one sentence
which deseribes Jesus himself in hised

growing years: “He advanced in
wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God *and man.” Here is the

fourfold) man:  metital, physical,
spiritual, social. It is for the com-
pleteness, the completion, -of man,
that Sabbath was made. The

six-day week, however we spend it,

the

leaves us one-sided. Six days of the
week we are consumers of grocer-
ies, makers and payers of bills. Sun-
day reminds us-that we do not live
by bread alone.

No rules can be given, But one
question can be asked: How does
Monday morning find you, as com-
pared with Saturday afternoon?
Are you a better person all around,
are you more of a man, are you a
truer woman? [f your mind is tired,
your body fagged (or merely fat-
tened), your spirit dejected, your
attitude toward people grouchy and
sour in general, then you spent Sun-
day wrong, whatever you did. But
if you are a really better person,
then your Sunday was well spent.
The right way to spend the Lord's
Day is the way that leaves you on
Monday better balanced, spiritually
cleaner and stronger, mentally keen-
er, socially more human and sym-
pathetic—all in all a better person
than you were at the fag end ot last
week.

To take only one point, for ex-
ample: How about your relationship
to God? Sunday should make you
more aware of him, It is quite true
that you can worship God .in the
out-of-doors, on a fishing trip or
on the golf course. But it is a fact

that the people who do worship God
are not generaliy to be found in a
fishing party or in a golf foursome
on Sunday morning. They are usual-
ly in church. To say “The Sabbath
is made for, fan” and then turn
your back on the church is to mis-
understand Jesus, it is to condemn
yourself to spiritual atrophy and to
ignore the highest element in your

in your soul,

But this is not the whole secret
the Lard’s Day. Long before
Jesus, a prophet spoke of doing
God's pleasure, not your own, on
the Sabbath, (lsaiah, chapter 58.)
Jesus made even more plain than

of

Isaiah did what the Lord’s pleasure
is. “It is lawful to do good on the
Sabbath Day.” (Matthew, 12:12.)
What good will Sunday do me? is
A deeper
question is:

not the whole question,
and more Christ-like
What good can | do on Sunday?
Thanks to law and custom (inspired,
originally, by Christian ideals) most
people do have more leisure time on
Sunday than on other days. Look
at-it this way: The Lord's day is
the time when you are freer to do
the kind acts for which you have
no time on other days. Vee know
what things Isaiah and Jesus called
wood: healing, teaching, the culti-
vation of friendships, relief of dis-
tress, bringing something of health

and truth-and justice to a diseased

and blind and distorted world. Sure-

ly, if you are a conscientious Christ>.),

ian, Saturday found you with many”
good intentions unfulfilled. Sunday
is the day when you can put some
of those intentions into action.

After all, the Christian name for
the. day is the. Lord’s Day. It is
named, now in his honor; let us
keep it so... You would celebrate

your mother's birthday, your wed-
ding anniversary, by doing some-
thing that not only please
but somehow symbolize the person

Lord’s Day is best honored by hon-

tight for a moment and opened
them again, but it was still there.
True, it had four wheels, “a body

make sure of this last point), but it
couldn’t boast of much else. The
front bumper was missing, the paint
was rusting off, and the fenders

started to open the: door, and the
handle came off in my hand. “Don’t
mind that,” said Bill, “just one of
its little idiosyncrasies. You will
get-used to it.” He got in from
the other'side and kicked my door
open from the inside. “Hop in and

$8,605,000 Needed to Rebuild
Y Program In Devastated
Areas
WORLD YOUTH FUND TO
AID TWENTY COUNTRIES
Davidson To Be Given Oppor-
tunity To Help .
Brooke Anderson, head of the
YMCA at Brown University, spoke
to the “Y” cabinet at its regular
meeting on April 23 in behalf of
the World Youth Fund, Mr. Ander-
son outlined the need for material
and spiritual aid in Europe and
Asia; he pointed out that the YMCA
is carrying out its program in sixty
eight countries around the world.
After words of introduction, Mr.
Anderson presented a_radio-type
play entitled “The Gentleman Cries
Peace,” which was a realistic por-
trayal of the unsettled conditions in
Greece and the work of the “Y”

| there. Following the drama a film,
true humanity—the image of God |

“The Invisible Bridge,” was shown

in which the need for reestablishing.

the “Y” program in devasted coun-

tries was pictured. 4
Youth Fund.

For the past several months Mr.
Anderson has been touring the
country and visiting college cam-
puses in an effort to secure the
help of American students in pro-
viding for their neighbors in Europe
and Asia. Asa means of rebuilding
the “Y” program in the war areas,
the World Youth Fund has been
set up, $8,605,000 will be raised:
1, to help lead young people of war
devastated countries back into
paths of moral decency and con-
structive living, and 2. to help re-
store certain key facilities of The
Association in places that were
hardest hit. The “Y” suffered most
heavily in Belgium, Bulgaria, Bur-
ma, China, Czechoslovakia, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Holland,
Hungary, Italy, Japan, Korea, The
Philippines, Poland, Roumania,
Siam and Yugoslavia.

Repair Damage

The money will be spent where
it is most needed; to consrtuct new
recreational centers and to repair
those damaged by war as well as to
provide salaries for sending new
“Y” secretaries into the field and
to purchase necessary equipment.

600 “Y” secretaries suffered dur-
ing the war—many gave their lives.
Some died before the firing squad,
others in-concentration camps, still
others from broken health, starva-
tion or overwork.

105 “Y” buildings were complete-
ly obliterated or partly destroyed
by bombs, artillery fire, or military
occupation.. In many instances,
these were the only’ modern build-
ings in their cities and were centers
for community-wide civic and wel-
fare projects that serve people of all
ages.

Peace In Hearts.

Several months ago, James F.
Burns made the following state-
ment: “World peace depends upon
what is in our hearts more than
what is in our treaties.” We cannot
hope to have a peaceful world until
there is peace in the. hearts of men.
Men cannot think of peace when
there is hunger and _ starvation
staring him in the face.

The vesper offering for one
Sunday evening will be set aside
for this fund. Thus Davidson stu-
dents may share in this work.

though.”

“Gee, I sure hope you do,” I
said fervently, rubbing the seat of
my pants.

As I walked away, I took one
look back at Religion. It was sit-
ting by the side of the road, looking
old and tired—andI..would_haye
sworn that it was scowling!
