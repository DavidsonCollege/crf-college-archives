Cat Runners Race To Three
Meet Wins After Slow Start

The Davidson cross-country
team, currently getting into

the thick of its fall dual-meet .

schedule, is riding the crest of
a three-meet winstreak.

The last two races, in the
past week, have produced
surprising victories by com-
fortable margins that argue
well for the upcoming com-
petition.

Sporting an overall record
of 3-2, Martin’s Marauders are
looking to improve on last
year’s 7-5 total, Experience,
depth, and a surprising fresh-
man class have combined to
give the team a look which
contrasts with the 1-14 and 2-12
records of 1970 and 1971.

The 1974-75 J.V. basketball
season .will begin its
preliminaries Monday with an
organizational meeting. Head
coach Bo Brickles is hoping
for an excellent team and
another winning season this
year. He is urging all in-
terested students to attend the
meeting at 5 p.m. in the
balcony of the gym. Practice

will begin Tuesday... ssesssssess cece

The first dual meet of the
season, on Sept. 24, found the
Cats traveling to Boone to at-
tempt to avenge the football
team’s thrashing at the hands
of the Apps.

The team was unfamiliar
with the course, the tem-
perature was an unholy 40

tor didn’t help. Also Ap-

tin was optimistic: “Overall I
was not disappointed with the
team’s performance. Ap-
palachian is one of the
toughest teams we'll face this
season, and that course was a
real mind-boggler. I was very
pleasantly surprised with the
race run by freshman Bill
McClement, who placed
second for us.”’

According to the team, run-
ning Appalachian at Boone is
not the worst thing in the
world. The worst thing in the
world is running Furman at
Greenville. That Friday the
Cats were burned again, 15-50.

This Saturday the Wildcats will attempt to return
from Wofford with a victory. Whether they are suc-
cessful or not is of little importance in the great

scheme of things.

The government will continue to rape us, and the
Suez Canal will remain closed regardless of

tomorrow’s outcome.

The logical conclusion is that the Wildcats don’t

count for penguin do-do. Many students will sup-
port this view. They will rightly claim that, there
are more important issues to worry about on Satur-
day afternoon.

So why care about the Wildcats? I’m not going to
argue from the school spirit angle, because I am
not a hypocrite. Instead, I want to make a case for
the team based on my belief that we can do more
for world peace and Spencer’s poor people cheering |
for the glory of. the black..and red than we can
brooding in the libary or passing the pipe around.

When we engage in an activity such as rooting for
a football team, we are saying that we care about
something besides the crap that this world con-
tinually feeds us. In a time of war, inflation and
another Nixon, we are saying that we aren’t down,
that the little things still matter to us.

If men lose the capacity to care about the little
things then there is no hope for this world. I am not
equating the Wildcats with universal salvation. But
to care about the Wildcats or the Dodgers or Stinky
is to show that you want to do something that has
meaning to you, and to hell with them and their
wars.

Maybe we can’t stop the evils of this world. But
we can effect the little things, and that’s what

The Cats negotiated the new

On Saturday, Oct. 5, the

an edge like that was back in

On Monday last, the sur-

laid to rest. Pinckney ran his
usual brilliant race,
first.
