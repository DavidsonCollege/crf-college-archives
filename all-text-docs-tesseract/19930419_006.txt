Beyond Birkenstock ... Seth J. McLaughlin & J. Kyle Kinner
A Final Word from Two Biting Social Critics

Birkenstop:

Hello Birkbabies.

Boy, its been agreat four years,
has itnot? How likely was it, back
in the heady days of sophomore
year (1991, for those of you who
are Not Seniors), and the Gantt/
Helms elections (when we offi-
cially started writing), that two so
stellar opinions columnists should
ever come to the fore? It was as if
you had found the Hope diamond
in your individually packaged box
of Wheaties; an event, in short, to
be marveled at and rejoiced over.
No, no... please hold all applause
till the end of the column, when
we’ll happily sign autographs (for
a small fee), Like the proverbial
whalehunters of yore . . . we’re
sure glad this fish is finally dead.

Now that we’ve said our
goodbyes, let’s consider the im-
pact of our much vaunted work on
the course of geopolitics and world
history in general (we are, after all,
legends inour own mi... er, time).
So reflect, before "Beyond

Birkenstock," there was murder,
mayhem, destruction and plague.
No, wait a minute, we still have all
of those things. Well, before us
there was _ unchallenged
Davidsonian pretentiousness, bom-
bastic and insensitive administra-
tion, and lazy students. Hold it.
Westill have those things too. OK,
now we’ve got it. Before "Beyond
Birkenstock," there wasn’ tany fun
around here. Now this place is a
hoot. We are, after all, the sole
causal agent for your present satis-
faction, contentment, and sublime
_ unencumbered bliss. Enjoy. Any
angst, ennui, or existential despair
should be laid squarely at the door
of contemporary culture, so don’t
come whining to us. You got that?

Speaking of whining, which
we would never do, a guy named
Robert Hughes wrote a book en-
titled Putting a Cork in the Whine
Bottle: Culture of Complaint which
the Birks have unfortunately not
been able to read just yet. Not to
fear, like every self-respecting
Davidsonian (and everyone else
with two letters to clack together
andcalladegree), WE READ THE
BOOK REVIEW!!! Aren’t you
excited? Now you too can get the
gratuitous hash of arehash that one
might encounter at any number of
fashionable parties where the par-
ticipants are uniformly and regret-
tably unable to “encounter the text”

as your English professor might
say (or that guy who over-pro-
nounces ‘‘Delacroix.”) But don’t
feel bad, we didn’t read it either.

According to Hughes, “’The
Right is as corroded by defunct
ideology as the academic left,’ and
pronounces a plague. on both
houses.” (Notice how the last part
is actually a quote from the Wash-
ington Post’s reviewer, Jonathan
Yardley—the perils of second-
hand reading). Anyway, whatelse
is new? One might as easily say
that the sun has risen this morning
and will resume its business to-
morrow as to trot out that old saw-
horse about the corrupted
intelligencia. Probably Hughes’
remarks are more profound than
this little “factoid” would suggest,
but so far, nothing new here.

Ab ha, at least a good turn of a
phrase: “When the 1960s animus
against elitism entered American
education, it brought in its train an
enormous and cynical tolerance of

student ignorance, rationalized as

a regard for 'personal expression’
and 'self-esteem'--not to mention
as an excuse for lazy, self-indul-
gent academics to wallow: in the
shine and yackety-yack of popular
culture.” Not exactly new, but a
truer statement were never spoke
by kith nor kin, we’ll warrant. If
the Birks have to read one more
gratuitous academic study whose
basis is “contemporary cultural
norms" or "culturally relevant is-
sue investigation,” we’re going to
puké. These paeans to the religio-
science of MEology invariably
couch their owner’s moral or po-

litical agenda in the clothing of
facticity with the result that one is
tempted not to believe any of the
people, .any of the time.

Professors, to your desks!
Throw out the flaccid prose and
circular logic of MOST feminist
ideology, deconstructionist theory,
and bio/environmental alarmism.
Right on, Hughes. We’re not say-
ing you have to return to weighted
anthropology and cultural/intellec-
tual imperialism, just balance your
perspective with fact (not insub-
stantial cultural conjecture) and
historical context. Scholars, unite!
The Birks have spoken.

What more can we say? Hav-
ing described and dismissed the
body of our likely readers, we bet-
ter wrap it up before youze guys
start the Post-King riots with our

column (there’s our generation’s

activism”). If it seems that we
wrote the same piece of calculated
invective every weck, well, that’s
because we did. Effective? Who
knows. Enjoyed it? Sure. Would
we ever spend another four years
in an undergraduate institution
again, even if our lives depended
on it? Not a. chance. A small
warning from the seniorclass toall
potential freshmen and women:
DON’T COME. RUN. AWAY
WHILE YOU STILL HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY. START A
WHOLLY ORGANIC BUSI-
NESS OF SOME KIND BUT
DON’T COME HERE.

On that note, have a great
howevermany years you have left
in this pri. . . er, institution of
higher learning. We did. C-ya.

Tony Finishes the Year with a Tewital Goodbye

By Tony Tuntasit

I think it would be neat if in
addition to the traditional Senior
Class Gift, you know, gifts like
that big well (Class of 29”) found
plastered on every Davidson sou-
venir from Post Cards to Hand-
books to Baby Bibs, the Senior
Class should write a song which
kids like me would have to sing at
all the Home Football Games, Bas-
ketball Games, Commencements,
Bake Offs, the beginning of class,
at 10:15 a.m., and every time I sign
the Honor Pledge. I can see it

already:. :
ANNOUNCER: Now that
1994 Wildcat Football team has
completed it’s first perfect season,
let’s all stand for the SENIOR
CLASS OF '93 HOMAGE TO SU-
PERIORITY ANTHEM!!
CROWD Standing, and
CHEERING):
-Oh Davidson Class of 1993
You are the foundation of
strength upon which we build
Knowledge, truth, and jus-
tice are traits you firmly held
We are mere goober heads

Think.

That's what .

The Union
Planning

Committee

wants you to
do.

If you have any ideas
about a new union,
please convey them to a
member of said group.

"Jesus Freak"

King continued from page 5

of faith” that I am describing.

In response to the label of
“Jesus freak” which Christians on
this campus and in our post-mod-
em society are often called, I take
suchanameasacompliment. What
a wonderful figure to be a freak
for! Whether or nota person views
Jesus as divinity or just a good
moral teacher, his message of love
is something which we should all
strive to adhere to. Through his
ministry, Jesus constantly focused
on love and inclusiveness. While
others of his time despised tax col-

Speaks Out

lectors, prostitutes, and other “‘sin-
ners,” Jesus not only associated
with them, but he loved them each
individually. Such themes do not
only coincide with the new phi-
losophy of openness and inclu-
siveness which Davidson College

seems to be developing, but are’

universal themes which any toler-
ant, enlightened person should wish
to strive for.

. Iwould like to close by thank-
ing Alex Crumbley for his article
and understanding.

Sincerely,
Rob King
Jesus freak

compared to you

Oh woe, Oh woe, What are

we to do?
I can see this already! And
I’m going to work along side with
Alden Smith to form ahandy dandy
SGA committee with one of those
cool names like THE COMMIT-
TEE FOR THE UNDERSTAND-
ING OF VERBS and by the year

- 1996, the year of my senior year, I

guarantee that the deficit will be
cut by at least .24% and spacemen
will land in Idaho.

Boy I’m glad the summer is
coming.

But even if the Seniors don’t
happen to get their song, there are
other fringe benefits to being a
Senior that overshadow a mere
song.

Take for example the respect
and awe that the underclassmen
have for the seniors:

A RANDOM IMAGINARY
UNDERCLASSMAN- Hey, do
yousee that guy rightthere hunched
over with the four book bags who
looks like he’s gotten about six

‘ minutes of sleep on his way through

Chambers -to his nine 400 level
courses?

JIMBO- You mean that guy
who’s tearing out each strand of
hair one by one and moaning

‘Please putme outof my,misery!’?

RANDOM MaAN- Yeah, that
guy.

JIMBO- What about him?

RANDOM MAN- He’s a se-
nior}!

JIMBO- WOW!! Poor guy.

(And they say that Freshmen —
are easy to spot.)

The seniors even get to have
Senioritis, a type of physical and
emotional burnout which deprives

. them of their motivation to learn

anymore.
The classic symptomsare bag-

‘ging class to go to the Lake when

it’s sunny outside, watching the
WSOC 14 hour Gomer Pyle,
U.S.M.C. Marathon, not bother-
ing to shower anymore, bagging
Class to go to the Lake when it’s
pouring outside, a large rash under
the armpit, and of course hysteria.

With all these goodies the se-
niors get, I guess that it must be
real hard for them to leave
Davidson, But] guess they have to
leave eventually. :

So I'd like to wish the
Davidson Class of 1993 the best of
luck in the real world. And if the
real world isn’t all that it’s cracked
up to be remember that here at
Davidson we are mere goober
heads compared to you.
