MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9,1996

Question of the week:
What is that steam?

It’s not seeping hazardous sewage, the result of a massive build-
up of geologic pressure, or the frustrated spirits of students past.
Actually, the mysterious mist which rises from the brick-paved
ground behind Chambers is nothing more than the result of “rainwa-
ter running down on hot steam pipes,” says Associate Director of
Operations and Maintenance Phillip Cashion. Rain reaches the
area’s main pipes, which are used to heat Chambers, the Union, and
other surrounding buildings, through any of Richardson Plaza’s

many manholes.

Students work Habitat
over the summer

Soon, Danny, Ethelene,
Danny Jr., Joey and Christopher
Jetton will be able to call the Wild-
cat House home. With only $5,000
left to raise of the $40,000 goal,
and finishing touches remaining
such as drywall application, paint-
ing and landscaping, completion
of the first Davidson College chap-
ter of Habitat for Humanity house
and the Jetton’s home is nearly
completed.

Such areality would have been
unimaginable for Ethelene Jetton
two years ago. Jetton once re-

marked to a friend how nice it
would be to live in a new house,
but that she and her husband could
never afford it. Her friend told her
to pray for one, and soon after, the
Davidson HabitatChapter called.
The Jettons currently live in
Huntersville, but come to the site
at537 West Side Terrace frequently
to put in some of the 300 “sweat-
equity” hours Habitat requires of
the families for whom it constructs
homes. “[They] are out there ev-

ery weekend,” says Meredith °

Strong, who is president of
Davidson’s Habitat for Humanity
Chapter.

Much work had been com-

Davidson boasts the coldest place in N.C.

By JEFFREY COKER

Many freshmen ask, “How
cold does it get here... 25, 20, 15
degrees?” Actually, they are off
by about 480 degrees Fahrenheit.
Don’t go buying knit gloves and
polypropylene underwear just yet,
though. It only gets this coldin one
room in the basement of the Dana
science building appropriately la-
beled “The Coldest Place In N.C.”

Lasers are being used in the
physics department to create tem-
peratures within one-thousandth of
a degree of absolute zero, one mil-
lion times colder than room tem-
perature.

. “The gteat thing about it is

how expensive it would have been
had we bought all the equipment.
We made most of it ourselves,”
says junior Mike Lee who, with

_seniors Andy Borleske and Clay
Lenhart, has been involved in the
project. John Cowan is currently
working with the laser for his se-
nior thesis.

“Tt would be a great place to
store beer,” says physics major
Ryan Conatser. Hardly, since only
a few atoms can be cooled at one
time.

“T prefer to call it the coldest
‘stuff’ in N.C.,” suggests Dr. Rob-
ert Cline, who heads the atomic
physics lab. Though impractical
for beer storage, the laser-induced
frigid temperatures create a per-

fect place to study the atom. A
circle of six lasers fire photons
toward a central point of cesium.
The cesium atoms are struck on all
sides by the photons, thus holding
them still to be studied.

“It’s much like stopping a
bowling ball by hitting it with a
million ping pong balls,” says Cline
who continues, “This project is
great because students have been
involved in every step in the pro-
cess. It is easy to get students
involved because it’s so easy to
explain and understand.”

The next time a Northern
friend calls and complains about
the cold, Davidson students can
respond, “It’s gotten a whole lot
colder here.”

pleted on the one-story, three bed-
room, two bathroom house when
school finished last year, but in
June, “they got it watertight so
they could leave it” intact during
the summer months, says Saralyn
J. Damanti, who. handles the
chapter’s publicity.

Now that volunteers are back
on campus, The remaining jobs,
sheetrock and wallpaper hanging,
door and cabinet installation and
painting, can be completed.

Though the goal of any Habi-
tat for Humanity Chapter is clearly
the construction of homes it builds
for needy families, Strong is more
specific when it comes to the Col-
lege chapter. “It has been my vi-

sion to build a house fully built by
the Davidson College community,”
she says. Strong sees “the goal of
‘the Davidson Habitat house is to
promote unity between students,
staff and faculty.”
_ To that end, Strong has tried
to ensure that no single residence
hall or athletic team comes to the
weekly construction days on Thurs-
day from 1 to 5 and Saturdays from
8 to 5. That way, the site always
has a diverse group of volunteers.
With the interruption of sum-
mer vacation and the arrival of
less-aware freshmen, Strong does
think that interest has slightly de-
clined from the height it reached

people going out and meeting the
Jettons to get momentum going .”

In the next few weeks, tables
will be set up in Chambers to re-
cruit volunteers. Anyone inter-
ested, especially faculty and staff,
should sign up then.
