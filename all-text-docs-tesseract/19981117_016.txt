It’s official: the greatest season ever

By Mike ANDERSON
Sports Editor

A five-year-old boy named Trent
Thornton (nephew of the Wildcat star
, linebacker, Wes) sat in the bleachers at
Bridgewater College Saturday watch-
ing the Wildcat football team. The
loyal Trent looked at his uncle’s team
and commented, “They’re good.”
He didn’t know how right he was.
The 1998 Wildcats made school
history with a record 8th victory, de-
feating Bridgewater on Saturday 14-8

son in Davidson’s 101-year football
history. The win marked their seventh
consecutive, tying a mark set back in
World War One. President Vagt of-
fered words of congratulations to the
*98 squad following the game, “I think
when something happens only once in
101 years, we all ought to feel this great
sense of pride, And the greatest thing of
the game was how happy they were at
the end of it, and that doesn’t begin to
match how happy we are for them.”
The Wildcats won the toss before
the game, and senior captain Chris
Frederick made the call to receive the
kick. The ‘Cats received that opening
kickoff, and drove deep into Eagle ter-
ritory before a touchdown was called
back on an illegal procedure infraction.
Davidson was forced to settle for a FG
from Brian Langley and a 3-0 lead with
7:57 remaining in the first quarter.
Bridgewater came up with an im-
pressive drive off the ensuing kickoff,
before freshman linebacker Sam
Fraundorf delivered a bone-crushing

hit to the Eagle receiver of a 3 yard -

shovel pass. The hit contributed toa key
stop early in the game, as Bridgewater
was forced to attempt a 57-yard field
goal that came up short.

Less than five minutes into the
second quarter, the Wildcats struck
again, this time on a touchdown carry
by Eric Ferguson who totaled 95 rush-
ing yards on the day. The ‘Cats caught
the Bridgewater defense off guard on

an 11-0 score:

Late in the quarter, senior defen-
sive back Clif Henry came up with a
huge play to quash a Bridgewater drive.

Mid-way through the 3rd quarter,
the Wildcats put together what would
prove to be their final scoring drive of
the season. Sophomore Corey “Slash”
Crawford started it off with an impres-
sive kick-off return up to the 38 yard
line. Just plays later, Bryan Kern ex-
ploded out of the Davidson backfield,

On the following possession, it
was Wes Jones that came up with the
big play, flushing the Eagle passer out
of the pocket that led to a poor pass and
another fourth down punt. Jones would
deliver yet again later in the quarter: On

The ‘Cats took over the ball, but
went four-and-out, giving Bridgewater
one more shot at a score. This time, the
Eagles drove down to Davidson’s 22,
and with 8 seconds left booted a 39-
yard field goal to cut the lead at half-
time to 11-3.

Bridgewater received possession

and were driving down the field until
sophomore Bo Henderson recovered a
fumble to give the ‘Cats possession.
Yet again, the ‘Cats were unable to
capitalize, ending the drive with a missed

and thanks in part to a nice bit of
downfield blocking by Roland Will-
iams, Kern’s spectacular run gave the
‘Cats a 1st-and-goal at the Eagle 9 yard
line. Three plays and a holding penalty
later, Langley booted a 27-yard field
goal from the left hash mark, giving
Davidson a 14-6 lead.

The ‘Cats defense lived up to form
with some impressive 3rd-down stops
to maintain the lead throughout the
fourth quarter. Early in the fourth, Ben
Spivey (whotied the team’s sack record
on the day) delivered a crushing hit to
the Bridgewater quarterback, forcing
an errant pass and a fourth down punt.

applied the pressure to force an over-
thrown pass out of the back of the end
zone.

The ‘Cats took over the ball on
their own six yard line, 2:03 away from
history. On the last crucial play of the
game, Dugan carried the ball for a first
down ona 3rd and 2, sealing the victory.
Dugan’s run marked the final install-
ment of yardage to his school record for
total career offense. With 54 seconds
left and Bridgewater out of time-outs, it
was only a matter of time. Fraundorf
and Chad Wright doused head coach
Tim Landis with his second Gatorade
bath in as many weeks.

One word could describe the
celebratory atmosphere following the
game; Class. The ’98 Wildcats showed
modesty and humility on their
opponent’s football field, calmly shak-
ing hands and then kneeling in prayer at
mid-field. Fans and parents joined the
elated team on the field as the Wildcats
sang O, Davidson! Coach Landis was
lifted upon his players’ shoulders and
the modest head coach held the game
ball up high. Tears flowed and con-
gratulations abounded before the team
boarded the busses to head back to
Davidson.

When they arrived home, a gather-
ing of students, alumni, and parents
were on-hand at Richardson Field to
celebrate the team’s milestone accom-
plishment. Senior Tom Ting was in
awe, “I’ve never seen anything like
this. I’ve dreamed about it and seen it on
TV, but never expected it to happen to
me.” The senior captain reflected, “Like
(associate head coach and defensive
coordinator) Coach Merritt said early
on, there is just something special about
this team. We didn’t know exactly what
it was, but the chemistry just came
together.” ‘

Wes Thornton added, “This is the
end-all. This is the best feeling we’ ve
ever had: We’ ve been working so hard
in the off-season and throughout the
regular season. Words can’t explain it.
To start off 1-2, and have a couple of
close games late, it was pretty tough.
But we held tight and stuck together.
It’s been a really emotional day for me
and a lot of the seniors. These guys are
my best friends. It’s been a great expe-
rience, one that I’ll cherish and never
forget.”

The victory had to be all the sweeter
for the Class of ’98, a group of young
men who have watched this football
program develop from a 1-8-1 team
during their freshman campaign into a
national powerhouse in Division I-AA
football. Quarterback and captain Tom
Dugan said, “This is the exact opposite
of that rock bottom. All of us seniors
have been here when we’ ve had tough
times. For us to pull it off and end it like
this is adream come true. Goes to show
you what faith and endurance will do
for you when you’ re struggling.”
