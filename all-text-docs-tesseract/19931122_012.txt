Singer/songwriter David Wil

By Rachel Newcomb

Several factors make David
Wilcox a cut above other singers
who might fall into the category of
“folk singers.” For one thing, his
voice is pleasant and capable of
conveying a wide range of feelings
that in other musicians might not
come across as sincere. His exper-
tise at the guitar allows him to
write careful, intricate songs. But
most of all, David Wilcox is as
much a storyteller as he is a
songwriter. His songs are laced
with personal anecdotes and hu-
morous metaphors that lighten the
serious nature of many of his lyr
ics.

On Saturday, November 13, a
sell-out Davidson crowd was
treated to an evening of his well-
crafted folk melodies and home-
spun stories. Because of its small
size, the 900 Room was the ideal
venue for an artist like Wilcox.
The personal nature of his perfor-
mances lend themselves more to
smaller halls which allow him to
connect with the audience.

Right away, it was apparent
that Wilcox would do more than
just perform a few songs for the
audience. He was as easygoing as
if he were in a small room playing
for a few friends. From time to
time, he’d tap one blue-jeans clad
leg in time to the music, his guitar
slung casually over his shoulder.

He opened with a song whose
pertinent lyrics spoke pointedly to
the mostly college-age crowd. “It’s
not just what you’re given, it’s

what you do with what you’ve
got,” he sang wisely. He followed
this with “Sunshine on the Land,”
a song whose soft melody show-
cased his calm, thoughtful voice.
Wilcox sang several songs
from his new album, which will be

Like a needle against the vein/I got
a weakness for strong chemistry/
One touch- all resolutions change.”
He then played “Farther to Fall,” a
song from his last album Home

moon-soaked wall and wind.” An-
other song compared a destructive
relationship to a drug addiction as
Wilcox sang of a beautiful and
dangerous poppy flower, the plant
from which opium is derived. “Our
bodies fit desperately together/

Settled Down)”, this song ex-
pressed Wilcox’s inability to fi-
nally grow up. Sarcastically he
tossed out the line, “I’m the oldest
in this bar/ And I’m drinking with
children/ On a field trip to observe
me in my habitat.” In another
song, he compared the single life
metaphorically to the life of the
neighborhood block dog, who can

always find a warm meal and a
roof to sleep under. “They don’t
make him wear a collar,” Wilcox
sang ironically.

Forthe last part of the evening,
Wilcox covered several songs from
his album How Did You Find Me
Here, including “Rusty Old Ameri-
can Dream,” the moving “Jamie’s
Secret,” and “How Did You Find
Me Here?” He also played the
chilling “Eye of the Hurricane,”
which tells the tragic story of a
friend who dies in a motorcycle
accident.

One reason that David Wilcox
has such intensely loyal fansis that
heis able to sing about experiences
and emotions ina way that gives
voice to unspoken. human fears.
Listening to him sing, it is easy to
identify with what he is saying.
Many of his songs are about rela-
tionships, but the lyrics are always

cox plays to record 900 Room crowd

subtle and never sappy.

His lyrics deal with both the
pain and the joys of life, and his
laid-back delivery makes them
seem even more personal. He has
an amazing rapport with his audi-
ence, Mar oi a
Whitehead, a Davidson College
junior and longtime Wilcox fan,
recounts an incident at one of his
concerts a few years ago. “I was
standing in the very back of the
room, and he brought me up to the
front and sat me on a speaker so I
could see better. Ihad the best seat
in the house.”

Wilcox has none of the swag-
gering rock star mentality that
makes other musicians so unap-
pealing. He’s the kindof guy whom
you could see yourself having late
night chats with, a man who, de-
spite his talent, seems down to
earth and friendly.
