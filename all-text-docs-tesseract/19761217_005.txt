Reviewing a movie that is placed in
a period corresponding in time to my
own toilet training is difficult but not
just because I was too young to
comprehend the dramas that were
being played out daily on the still-
youthful TV networks.

McCarthyism, which is the subject

of The Front, was the first news event —

to receive wide TV coverage, but the
details have faded from the collective
mind as quickly as the remembi&ance
of ‘‘detention centers”’ for thosa of
Japanese descent in the U.S. during
World War II or the secret bombing
of Cambodia in our more recent
debacle. Faded is perhaps too soft;
suppressed is a more apt description
for the public’s reaction to these
events that masqueraded under the
banner of patriotism.

Woody Allen is the little guy
turned hero in The Front, but it is not
a ‘‘Woody Allen Movie.’’ For the first
time in Allen’s career, he plays a
fairly serious role in a movie that he

‘Did you say study? Yes, I plan to,
but not a lot, because I’ve got a term

Christmas.’’ When asked how she
would go about it, she responded:
“With the elves, no— I don’t think

I'll get much done, just get back on a
regular level. I need a break at
MacDonald’s because they don’t have
one at Davidson.”’

‘Yeah. Because if I don’t, I'll
forget it all. I’ll probably just go over
stuff.’’ Will you be glad to get. back
home? ‘‘No, I’d much rather stay here
and eat Slater all day and all night.”’

“T have to or I’m sunk.”

‘‘Yes, the same way I study here. |

enough self-discipline I’d like to get
ahead. But, I—I don’t think I'll have
enough self-discipline.’’

‘“‘T plan to go home and see the
movies of all the books I have to
read.”

“Yes, I plan to shut myself up in
my room away from all the Christmas
cheer and fill my noggin full of
‘Humes.’ I know I will get something
done. I'll just have to deprive myself
‘of the bodily pleasures I could receive
over the holidays and study.”

that I’ll ever get around to it.” How

“Oh yes, tons. I study more over

‘Just make sure I study three hours a

Allen acts serious schrodk

a standard Allen movie, complete
with Allen’s usual self-depreciating
stance, but then an old friend shows
up to ask him to put his name on a TV ©
script that he can not sell. Not
because it isn’t good, but because he’s
been blacklisted, branded as a com-
munist; or suspected of being a
communist—or at least a sympathi-
zer. Perhaps he had signed the wrong
petition, or knew the wrong people, or
just thought the wrong thoughts.
Like countless others in the enter-
tainment field, he is a victim of his
government, ala Joe McCarthy and
supporters.

Allen takes on the job as a cover,
but hardly for altruistic reasons. Soon
he is representing several writers and
plotting on bigger plans and the
schnook becomes a high-powered
capitalistic manueverer as fame, for-
tune, and. love come his way.

Director Martin Ritt nicely handles
the conversion from clerk to Miaas
and distrust replaces comic sympathy
in perceiving Allen’s role. Allen sees
friends being destroyed by the omi-
nous men in grey flannel who relent-
lessly search out the wrong thinkers,
banning them from work, but his
reaction is unemotional and his
solution is to throw a little money in
to their defense—until an actor,
played by the elastic-faced Zero
Mostel, commits suicide and the
woman he loves leaves him.

Standard plotting, but it effectively
jolts the viewer back into a concious-
ness of just how pernicious McCar-
thyism Was. Because the movie starts
as an Allen comedy and then changes
focus it creeps up unsuspectingly,
turning reactions from laughter to
indignation.

When Allen finally makes his stand
against thé members of the House
Unamerican Activities Sub-Commit-
tee and the audience is once again
with Allen, but he is no longer the
schnook or capitalist. Allen, the man
of principle, counters their oxymoro-
nic questioning deftly, as the audi-
ence cheers him on.

Finally he rises slowly to leave,
rather than compromise, and when he
tells the members of the committee to
fuck themselves, the audience erupts.
Hokey, yes, but effective and very
healthy too.

The only scene where the movie
really breaks down is the closing
scene where Allen, the writers he
represents and his girlfriend are
solidly reunited as Allen is taken
away in handcuffs to do time for
contempt. It is presented in the worst
tradition of Hollywood schmaltz ro-
mantic—prison is about as romantic
as working your way through college,
principle or not.

The Front is a good movie without
pretense; it is well-acted and directed,
but weak because of its traditiqnal
plotting. It combines humor with a
special kind of horror and it may jog a
few minds and reawaken us to what
has happened in the past to indivi-
duals in the name of-love of country.
