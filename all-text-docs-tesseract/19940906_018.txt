8O YEARS OLD

Che Havidsonian

By Scott M. Lenhart

During this decade, "The
South’s foremost college weekly"
followed the lives of the Davidson
student during the pivotal years
preceding and during World War
II. C. Shaw Smith Sr. as Colin the
magician entertained the campus,
and Chalmers Davidson became

the college’s head librarian. ‘The
ee VOWLES, 1937
On smoking

& North
Carolina

Can North Carolina be held
culpable for poisoning the hu-
man race, I ask myself. Growing
up, we were make to feel almost
unpatriotic if we didn’t smoke
cigarettes. Cigarettes were
tossed out at football games. The
fraternities who smoked the most’
cigarettes won prizes. We wona
prize by smuggling virgin wrap-
pers out of the Old Gold factory
and crumpling them by night.
Thus we outwitted the industry.

True, we had warning long
before the cancer scare. The
term “‘coffin nail” goes back to
1885, according to Eric Par-
tridge. . I dabbled in cigarettes
only briefly, switching to cigars
(in the perhaps-folk belief that
paper was the real culprit). The
only trouble with that was I
couldn’t quite determine my
politics between those two cigar
advocates Lee Iacocca and Fidel
Castro. So I settled for Edward
G. Robinson. In 1986 I gave up
tobacco altogether, nudged by a
heart experience. I still like to
read that hymn to the cigar, Holy
Smoke, by the Cuban novelist G.
Cabrera Infante (1985).

The fact remains that two of
the finest scholars I know are
dying of emphysema, and I sus-
pect that if they had it to do over
again they wouldn’t give up the
filthy weed. Walter De La Mare
said he couldn’t write poetry
without cigarettes, and Stephen
Spender even worked out a ra-
tionale that cigarettes siphoned
off certain physical energies and
thus enable creativity. Idoknow
that once I was in London on the
way to Stockholm to read a
learned paper that I simply could
not finish and that by smoking
myself silly ina hotel room I was
able to bring it off to a trium-
phant conclusion. I wouldn’t go
so far as Richard Klein, how-
| ever, to write a book called Ciga-
rettes are Sublime, published,
appropriately enough, by the
Duke University Press. Who
else? Rather, I would say, with
the late Frank Zappa, “Tobacco
is my favorite vegatable.” These
were among his dying words.

it seems, inextricably wedded to
each other.

The guilt lies, I suspect, ina
smoke screen, a deliberate ob-
fuscation, on the part of the in-
dustry. And I doubt that the
moguls can ever be held account-
able. Too bad.

So tobacco and creativity are, as |

World War II

college built a new library, the
Martin Chemistry building, and
made plans for Duke Dormitory
and Johnston gym. During this
growth, Davidson faced the world
war and became a training ground
for army flyers, and the paper itself
went from the standard eight page
issue to a four page pamphlet dur-
ing paper shortages. Nevertheless,

campus life continued, and The
Davidsonian kept on keeping on,
Ghosts

My two favorite sections of
the paper during the, late thirties
were “Town Tattle,” where the
most mundane occurrences were
related to the readers, such as Mrs.
C. K. Brown’s trip to Tallahassee
to visit relatives, and “Classroom

Downtown Davidson

Quotes,” where the staff would
collect the sayings of the week,
like a professor’s misunderstood
statement in the November 4th is-
sue: “I do like to ride students, but
if you’re sensitive, come and see

- me.” After that issue, the section

was never to be seen again.

In 1935, during the career of
the wildcats’ star fullback Baxter
“Chub” Yarborough, the energetic
Davidsonian staff probed into the
the innermost workings of waste
under the headline “New Sewage
Plant Attracts Interest.” Go get
‘em, boys.

The Davidson community
faced two tragedies during the ’’35-
36 academic year. On November

: 27 (my birthday), a student acci-

dentally shot and killed another
student while cleaning a .38 cali-
bre automatic pistol on fourth
Watts. (I’ll let you guess which
room). Earlier that year, the entire
town came together to the home of
Mrs. Hengeweld, whose stove blew
up, destroying her entire kitchen.
She only commented through her
tears, “Well, I’ve wanted a new
kitchen for along time; now I'll get
one.”
Sandburg and “Speedy”

On October 14, 1936, Carl
Sandburg came to Davidson to read
his poetry, to play his guitar, and to
deliver his speech ““Hyacinths and
Biscuits.” After singing traditional
folk songs, Sandburg left the Cham-
bers audience with, “Your faces
have been so kind to me. I than!
you.” :

In the December 2 issue, the

staff ran a profile on Bill “Speedy”

White, the insane cyclist. Twice a
year, he would leave his home in
Abbevile, S.C. and ride 150 miles
to attend Davidson. At the close of
the semester, he go back home on
his well-worn Huffy at the average
speed of 10 mph.
' Believe it... or not

Then, during my reading of
dusty back issues, I found some-
thing very interesting: on Decem-
ber 16, 1936, Yale withdrew her
claims to the first X-ray photo-
graph ever made in the U.S. This
made Davidson College the sight

of the first American X-ray pic-
ture. In 1837, three students be-
came interested in the study of
Crooke’s tubes, an expensive ap-
paratus that the physics depart-
ment had just acquired. One night,
the students wanted to recreate the
“shadow pictures” of Dr.
Roentgen’s experiment with the
tubes. They broke into the physics
labs, stole some equipment, and
went into their experiment room.
After their successful first picture
of familiar objects, the students
shot a bullet into a cadaver’s hand
and took another picture. Because
they stole the apparatus, they hid
the pictures for a long time for fear
of expulsion. Believe it ... or not.

Davidson and the War

With the turn of the decade,
the staff turned to fears and anxi-
eties of the approaching war. In
February of 1941, the college col-
lected clothes and blankets under
the “Bundles for Britan” program,
and we sent 350 copies of the King
James Bible tothe men ofthe U.S.S.
North Carolina. Also, a confused
guest lecturer and noted “expert”
predicted victory for the British
within one year without American
intervention. The paper turned its
focus to the Davidson ROTC, and
the college changed its schedule

‘by speeding student graduation in

line with the national defense pro-
gram. Blood drives and trial black-
outs for enemy air raids dominated
campus activities. In February of
1943, the Army Air Corps trained
cadets in pre-flight instruction at
Davidson. The Army turned dorms
into barracks as over 500 men came
to the campus.

Although the campus came
together to support the war effort,
Davidson raised enough money for
the construction of the Grey Me-
morial Library, which is now the
college union and the Martin
Chemistry Building. With the
completion of the new library on
October 2, 1941, Chalmers
Davidson, our head librarian, or-
chestrated two lines of students
and professors to pass books down
the line from the the old Carnegie
Library.
