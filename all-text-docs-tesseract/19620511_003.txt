A REVIEW OF SPORTS

With the baseball team’s two games with Geo
Southern and The Southern Conference Track Meet
ing the only action left on the agenda for the 1961-62
pong “my i aeetemaet do is to take a look at the
season re ,

The overall record of all individual sports added
together comes out to be 77-91, which is not a “good”
record, but neither is it that bad considering ae | of
the schools with which we compete. An analysis of all
team results will show that, except for two sports, the
teams pretty well held their own.

FALL SPORTS WERE GOOD

In fact, during the fall and on into the winter, we
were compiling at least a break even record in all sports.
The football team came out the victors in their last two
contests to finish with a respectable 4-4 record, an im-
provement over the previous season’s 3-5 showing.

The soccer team, while not being able to match the
previous season record of 8-3, still came out on the win-
ning side by taking six and dropping only four of their
contests. The cross-country team, behind pace-setter
Sterling Martin, rounded out the fall schedule with a
4-4 record.

At the start of the winter sports things began to
look a little worse as the hoopsters dropped their first
six in a row. They recovered in fine style, however, win-
ning the next twelve, and. finishing the season with a
highly respectable 14-11 record.

The swimming team wasn’t able to match the basket-
ballers’ showing, but still was able to come out with a re-
spectable four wins and seven loses. The wrestling team
turned in the best won-lost record of all varsity sports,
7-3, and also took with it the state championship. In
riflery the sharpshooters almost evened out their showing
for the year, finishing with a 21-22 record.

Disaster finally struck during the apeing sports, how-
ever. An inexperienced golf team was able to collect only
two wins and finished the season with a 2-16 record. Also,
the highly rated baseball team was unable to fulfill pre-
dictions and so far has a 7-17 showing.

Fogleman’s first year as tennis coach was
able to produce.a respectable 7-10 record, and track came
through with an even better record, 3-3, the only spring
sport able to break even. They also took a first in the
Davidson Relays.

This year has not been without its better moments.
One of the most outstanding performances of the year
was the football team’s exciting last-second victory over
William & Mary, which showed what kind of fighting unit
the team had molded into during the latter part of the
season.

The fine season experienced by the wrestling team
would certainly be listed among the highlights of the
year, compiling their best seasonal record since 1935.

BASKETBALL BIGGEST HIGHLIGHT

However, even though there were many fine per-
formances by different teams during the year, none could
match the interest that the basketball team aroused
among the students. As the baskethallers rolled up victory
after victory there was a true revival of spirit and team
support that was a remarkable thing to watch.

This was, then, the real t in sports here this
past season. An aggressive coach and a hman team
that was one of the best in the South and probably the
best in Davidson’s history point out that this is not the
end either. A team that only won thme games year

mei No analysis of the suceess o fllure of a sports pro

No analysis o
should be complete without considering more

won-lost record, however. The benefits to the individ-
ual should be the ion.

LARGE N RB IT FROM PROGRAM
This is where the athletic at Davidson
achieves its greatest success. The number of schol-
given to boys who pate in sports means
that more individuals, without outstanding abilities, can
out and compete with others on an equal basis.
means that more boys are able to receive the satis-
faction and benefits from athletics than would otherwise

be possible.
Davidson should be proud of a pooprem that enables
more than 35 per cent of its students to earn letters in

one or more , and should made all efforts to expand
this program in any way it can.
TEAM CAPTAINS ELECTED

Captains for next year’s teams have been elected in

several . These sports are soccer, wrestling, swim-
ming, and basketball.
‘Next year’s baseball ca has also been voted for

but Coach Stevens declined to release this information
before the athletic banquet, at which time the winner
will be announced.

next fall’s soccer squad is Charlie Sasser.
— who plays left wing, is a Kappa Sig from Con-

me.

— Carter Mebane will be heading the ’Cat mermen
next fall. Mebane, a Sigma Chi, swims the 220 and 440
yard freestyle events.

In a meeting of the wrestling squad Tom Wright was
chosen to captain the matmen for the coming season.
Wright wrestles in the 123 and 130 pound classes.

Big Bill Jarman will captain the ’Cat basketballers
during the next season. Jarman, high scorer and top
rebounder last year, has a big job ahead of him as the
basketballers will be taking on several really tough
schools such as Princeton, Cincinnati, Wake Forest, and
Duke.

The finals in these events,
along with the pole vault, high
jump, mile, 3-mile, and mile
relay, will take place Saturday
afternoon.

FURMAN STRONG

Davidson track coach Heath
Whittle said the conference
championship would be ‘‘a toss-
up between Furman and The
Citadel.” Furman is slightly
favored since they have already
beaten the Citadel in a dual
meet this year.

“In a big meet such as Con-
ference,” stated Whittle, “your
individual stars count more.”
The Citadel is rated strong in
the field events while Furman
ranks highest in the running
department.

Davidson will enter the fol-
lowing boys in the conference
meet: the 100 and 220, Ken
Kelly and Bob Cordle; the 440,
Avery Burns and John Sharp;
the mile, David Gilmour; the

3-3 SEASON RECORD

The ‘Cats have had a good

season this year, finishing with

a 3-3 overall record, and also)

winning the fourth annual’ Dav-
idson Relays.

Cordle is the team’s high
scorer this year. He runs the
100 and 220, is a member of
the mile relay team, and broad
jumps.

Along with Cordle, the ‘Cat
thinclads will be depending a
lot on season standouts Andy
Boggs, John Sharp, John Childs,
and Keith Fraser, who recently
set a new Davidson record for
the high jump.

Whittle expects a better bal-
anced team next year, hoping
that rising sophomores such as
Chester Davis, Dick Guerrant,
Tommy Heffner, Ronnie Reese,
Allan Turner, and Jim Wallace
will add the needed depth.

Tomorrow the ‘Cats baseball
team plays its final game of the
season in the second of a two
game series with Georgia South-
ern. The ‘Cats lost a previous
two game series at Statesboro

trip.

Davidson garnered only nine
hits against Georgia Southern
in the earlier games, However,
the ‘Cat pitchers allowed only
ten hits, but were the victims

With a 7-6 victory over the

SAE’s, the Phi Delts captured
the IMAC Softball Tournament
and assured themselves of first
place in the IMAC overall stand-
ings for the sixth consecutive
year.

By winning this year, Phi
Delta Theta retired the IMAC
trophy for the second time in
a row.

DELTS BEHIND, 54.

Overcoming an early 5-4 defi-
cit, the Phi Delt softballers scor-
ed 2 runs in the bottom of the
fifth to go ahead 6-5. The SAE’s,
however, came back with a run
in the top of the sixth to tie the
score at 6 apiece.

In the lower half of the inning
Tony McNay, the SAE pitcher,
retired the side in quick order.

The top of the seventh found
the SAE’s failing to score off
the Phi’s ace Randy Austin, who
had’ pitched outstanding ball
throughout the entire tourna-
ment.

WINNING RUN IN SEVENTH

Leading off for the "Delts in
the bottom of the seventh, Nat
Harris drew a walk. Bill Bank-
head followed by banging out a
single to move Harris into scor-
ing position on second. Britt
Smith, the next batter, made a
sacrifice bunt, moving the
runners to third and second.

missed, but the ball passed
through the legs of the SAE
catcher John Starling, allowing
Harris to easily score the game-
winning run from third.

SAE’s DOWNED KAPP’ SIGS

In a game played Monday, the
SAE’s overpowered the Kappa
Sigs 9-5.

Costly errors proved to be
the Sigs’ downfall as the SAE’s
scored 5 unearned runs to take
the victory and the right to play

the Phi Delts in the finals of
the tournament.

The SAE’s had good hitting
from McNay, Ivan Rohrer and
Joe Parker, the latter getting a
timely 2 run single in the cru-
cial contest.

Jim Gaither, with a 3-run
homer, paced the Sigs’ hitting
attack.

The winning pitcher was Tony
McNay with Mac Henderson re-

Junior Frank McPhillips turn-
ed in the ‘Cats’ best round for
the tourney, 161, firing an 83 on
the first day and a 79 the sec-
ond. Haywood Evans was close
behind McPhillips with a 79-84;
163.

Other 'Cat golfers at the tour-
nament were Gene Wells, Bob
Bost, and Tom Neal. Only
scores from the four lowest
scorers were counted.

Medalist winner in the tourna-
ment was Walton Smith from
Furman. Smith's total for the
two days was a low 149.

Commenting on the tourney,
Coach Tom Scott said, “We
didn’t do too good but that was
to be expected; we just didn’t
have a good year.”

Tom Neal, the only senior on
the team, finished his career at
the match.

Scott hopes that, with the help
of four or five good sophomores
next year, plus the loss of only
one player, he will be able to
turn out a much better team
next year.

The annual athletic banquet
will be held Monday night in the
dining room in Chambers Build-
ing. Approximately 400 people
are expected to attend.

Graham Showalter pitched
well for the first four innings,
allowing only two hits. He ran
into trouble in the fifth when
the Indians bunched three hits
and two walks for four runs.

Tom Hamilton, who went the
distance at West Virginia, reliev-
ed Showalter and finished the
game, giving up only one hit
and an unearned run in the
seventh.

In the second game the ‘Cats
exploded for their biggest in-
ning of the year, scoring seven
runs in the fourth inning. Tom
