“I hope we can _ finish
fourth,’’ Whittle said. “‘We
placed fourth in the indoor

meet this winter, and I hope *

we can repeat the perform
ance this weekend."

The two-day event will be-
gin today with the prelimi
naries. The finals will be
held tomorrow.

Junior Tommy Richardson,
the. Cats premier sprinter,
is a doubtful performer for
Davidson. Whittle stated that
Richardson has been both-
ered by a pulled muscle in
his leg for a couple of weeks,
and it is questionable wheth-
er or not he will be ready
by this weekend.

Whittle said the main hopes
for the Wildcats are
Kirley in the shot put and the
discus, David Crumpler in
the discus, Ed Dobbs in the
javelin, and Ray Sweten
burg in the triple jump and
the high hurdles. He said he
also has hopes that the 440
and mile relay teams will

Whittle mentioned Sweten-
burg as a possible for first
place finishes in both of his
events. ‘He will have a lot
of competition,’ he remark
ed, ‘‘and he will have to do

Sig Eps, Delts Hold Lead

By HOWARD BOYD

The SPEs and Delts re-
mained. unbeaten and atop
their respéctive leagues in
IMAC softball this week.

In League B, the. SPEs
rolled past the KAs 18-7 and
crushed Cannon 1
stretch their win skein to
six.

The SPEs have depended
on good hitting and near-
flawless defense thus far and
appear the team to beat in
League B.

Shortstop Buzz Tarver and
centerfielder ‘Larry Duncan
have provided the long ball,
while the pitching of Robin
Gray and John Bruner's
glove at second key the de-
fense. :

The: Pikas whipped the
Gamms 12-7, Watts-Belk 25-2
and €ast 1 11-7 to move into
undisputed second at 5-1.

Their. only loss, 194 to the
Delts, came early, and now
that the hitting is coming
around. and the defense is
improving, the Pikas are
again a top threat.

Vet catcher Ken Prestwich
is the top home run threat,
and teams with — versatile
Mark \Affeldt and outfielder
George Graff to spark the
team.

- The Gamms are 4-2 after
the Pika loss and a 12-11 win
over: W-B, and hold third.

The Gamms:were hurt by
the loss of several key per:
formers, but have gotten
good clutch hitting. They
need to score more runs and
make the big play defensive-
ly if they are to challenge.

Bill Telford is a three-year
veteran on the mound. Sophs

Batten have helped defen-
sively.

The Indies, strengthened
by inactives, have a_ well-
rounded squad which has
come through in the clutch
both offensively and defen-
sively.

Last week: the Indies top-
ped W-B and East I 11-9, be-
fore losing to the Betas 7-4
Wednesday night, and are
now 4-3.

The Betas moved into a tie
for third with the Gamms
at 4-2 by virtue of their win
over the Indies.

Pitcher Earl Ellis, speedy
Jay Bowen, John Douglas,
and
Henry Marrow lead the Be-
tas, who have lost only to
the SPEs and to Cannon I
74 on Thursday.

Meanwhile, in League A
the Delts turned a well-bal-
anced attack and airtight de-
fense plus five Machi errors
into a 10-2 triumph in a bat-
tle of unbeatens Tuesday
night.

Nine Delts hit safely in a
twelve-hit assault and Dave
Most hurled a five-hitter.

The Machis jumped off to

a 2-0 lead behind the hitting,

of John Saunders and Jim
Hudson but the Delts -broke
loose for seven runs in the
fourth to put it away.

The Delts ripped Cannon I
14-6 and won over the Pi
Kaps by forfeit in other ac-
tion last week and stand 7-0.

The Machis dropped to sec-
ond at 6-1, gaining forfeits
over the Snus and the SAEs
and pounding ‘East I 204
behind Saunders’ five hits
and Hudson's four RBIs.

The Sigs bounced back from

that
the Delts last week with a

10-6 win over Cannon II to
hold third place at 5-1.

The fourth-place Taus won
over. the Snus in a forfeit and
belted East tl 11-6 Wednes-
day for their fourth win in
SIX. Starts.

as well as his best this year.
But ‘Ray has the capability
of earning two firsts.”’
Whittle picked William and
Mary as a. shoo-in for first

‘place in the conference meet.

“There is no other school in
the Southern Conference who
can come close to beating
them,”’ he said.

He said second place would
be a real close contest be-
tween Furman and the host
team, East Carolina. After
Davidson, he predicted The
Citadel, Richmond, and V.-
M.I. would scramble for the
last three ‘places.

Whittle mentioned four out-
standing performers who will
be competing in the meet.
He said the conference rec-
ord most likely to fall is the
100 yard dash mark, which
is now 9.5 seconds. William
and Mary's Mike Fratkin
has already run 9.5 several
times this year’

Whittle said the meet
would have two outstanding
long distance men in Jim
Kidd of East Carolina and
Howell Michaels of William
and Mary. Kidd beat Mich-
aels in the: indoor meet this
year in the mile, but Whittle
said he did not believe the
two would meet this week-
end. “If Kidd enters the
mile, (Michaels will run in
the 880 and vice versa,’ he
continued. ?

Whittle said that whichev
er events they enter, each
will win a first. He added
that Michaels, last year’s A.
A.U. mile champion, should
also win the steeplechase.

In the last meet for the

Wildcats on their regular

ason schedule, Davidson
traveled to The Citadel on
April 21. With only four
events to go and Davidson
trailing by a narrow margin,
Whittle said, ‘The rains
came, and the wind blew."

Lightning struck a trans-
former near the track and
some wires fell across the
backstretch. Since the teams
were so close, the meet was
called ‘‘no contest” and will
not be completed,

Davidson was paced by
Swetenburg and Richardson
in. the indoor meet as Swet-
enburg took the hurdles
crown and Richardson the 60
yard dash in an upset over
Mike Fratkin. Richardson
has not seen any action since
his injury.

Next weekend the team will
compete in the North Caro-
lina meet at Duke University
‘in Durham.
