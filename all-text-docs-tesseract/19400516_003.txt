Tribute Paid to Davidson’s
Retiring President

By J. K. ROBINSON

If and when the ‘frustees” of
Davidson elect a new president, Dr.
Lingle, who has been connected
with the -college for over thirty
years, will hand over to the new
official a much more prosperous

and important college than the one

which existed when he came.
During his “thirty-eight years as

a Davidson official, he has occupied

two of the most important posi-
tions of the college, chairman of
the Board of ‘Trustees for twenty-

seven years, and president for clev-
en Wears. In this time
the body, the faculty and
the plant, including Woth buildings
and endowment, almost trebled.
While
