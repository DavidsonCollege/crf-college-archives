Spring football practice at Davidson began

The Purple Hurricane from Furman con-
tinued to blow with its usual strength against
Davidson last Saturday night by trouncirg
the Wildcats 39 to 24. Furman, one of the
strongest teams in the South this season, has
twice defeated the University of South Caro- |
lina, rated by able critics as one of the best
quints in the Southern Conference, and sev-
eral other of the leading Palmetto state fives.

Captain Goodykoontz to Issue Call
for Cinder Path Stars First
Part of Month

Preliminary practice for the track team
will be begun during this week. No definite
announcement has been made by Coach Tex
Tilson as to the prospects of the team, but
from statistics they look fair.

The fact that 10 letter men are back, and a |

wealth of reserve material to carry on the
flying banners, sounds good, but Captain
Goodykoontz states that not all places are
cinched and if a man even thinks he has a
feeling toward track, he will be needed.

Jennings will again enter the pole vault.

The weights will be‘ carried by two vet-
erans in Lincoln and Bohannon, while the
high jumps will be contested between D, M.
and R. G. Calhoun. |

In the broad jump, there arises a vacancy, |
which must be filled in by some new material.

The prospects for the freshman team re-
mains uncertain. During the cross-country
try-out in the fall quite a few new men showed
up exceedingly well and rhany of them have |
a somewhat enviable record in both high |
schools and prep schools. The team, when |
chosen, will probably have three meets. One
with the high schools, a possible preliminary
meet, and finally the annual state meet.

The schedule for tehvgKu Dg-ars i

The schedule for the varsity, which has al-
ready been made, is as follows:

March 26—V. P. I., Blacksburg, Va.

April 2—N. C. State, Raleigh, N. C.
