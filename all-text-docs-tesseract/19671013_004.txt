Duke University’s Blue
Devilettes proved to be more
than Davidson's freshmen
gridders could handle last
Friday, when the Devilettes
crushed the ‘Kittens 17.7.

The Dukettes were the first
to score, hitting paydirt in
the second quarter. The ‘Kit-
tens failed to score until the
fourth quarter, when Rick
Hawarah snared a pass and
scrambled 19 yards to tie the
score at 7-7.

The Blue Hose depend
largely on the passing efforts
of Quartérback Bill Kirtland,
who has passed for more than
400 yards this season. His
favorite target has been end
Dan Eckstein.

Presbyterian has chalked
up a 32.1-1 record this year.
They played Frederick Col-
lege to a scoreless tie, but
then battered Lenoir Rhyne
College 26-7 and Wofford

ped Furman earlier this sea-

for a successful afternoon on
the rushing of fullback Kerry

Smith said his team has
been trying to toughen their
defense this week. “The per-
formance of the defense has
been exasperating this year.”
he said. “We're working hard
to get settled on that now.
By moving George Hannen

sophomore still managed to
haul in five passes, even
though he is not quarterback
Jimmy Poole’s prime target.

Concentration. Hannen
said, is the secret to being a
good receiver. “You must
forget the defensive man and
concentrate on catching the
ball. After that you must pro-
tect yourself and run.”

Hannen has small hands
and is not fast and must rely
on concentration and decep-
tion.

Mostly Hannen runs pre-
set patterns, but occasionally.
he and Poole arrange free
lance plays. Most of the pat-
terns are slant-in runs, where
the receiver pivots on the
middle. However, for varia-
tion he sometimes pivots to
the outside.

Hannen is only a_ sopho-
more, and Coach Homer
Smith has hopes for Hannen
playing for two more sea-
sons. "George has really im-
proved and is a fine pass re
ceiver.”’

Tomorrow Hannen will

There had been some specu:

‘Incredible Sequence’ Derails
Wildcats . In Richmond Game

By DANNY WHITE
Assistant Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcats
looked like a winner for three
quarters against Richmond
last Saturday but what Coach
Homer Smith called an “‘in-
credible sequence of events”
powered the Spiders to 17
points in the fourth quarter
and a 24-17 conference vic-
tory over the ‘Cats.

The defeat leaves the soph
omore-laden ‘Cats with a 1-3
record after four conference
contests.

The “incredible sequence
of events’ began with the
‘Cats holding a 17-10 advan
tage and in good field posi-
tion on the Richmond side of
the 50-yard line.

First, Davidson received a
15-yard holding penalty. On
the next play Quarterback
Jimmy Poole was caught for
a 15-yard loss trying to pass.
Two consecutive offside pen-
alties put the ball on the ‘Cat
19 with fourth down and 50
yards to go for a first down.

The Spiders, benefiting
from good field position after”
the. punt. drove 51° yards in
four plays to tie the score
17-17.

On the second play after
the kickoff, Poole threw his
only interception of the
game. However. the ‘Cats
held and Richmond was forc-
ed to attempt a field goal

Harriers Destroy U

Davidson's cross - country
team brought its record to
two wins against a single
loss Monday, when the harri-
ers defeated the University
of North Carolina at Char-
lotte and Western North Car-
olina in a dua! meet here.

Davidson defeated UNC-C
by a score of 19-39 and wcu
by 15-48 to pace the field.

UNC-C grabbed second
place by downing WCU, 19-

Western Carolina's harri-
ers are coached by Heath
Whittle Jr., whose father

cross-country,

John Puckett of Davidson
claimed first place in the
meet with a time of 22:48
minutes over the four-mile
course.

“Puckett ran an excellent

Before the turn of events in ‘

the final quarter, the ‘Cats
were cruising on Poole’s arm
with a 10-point lead.

However, the Spiders scor
ed first in the game on a
nine yard pass from Buster
O'Brien to Kellum in the first
quarter.

Davidson came back in the
second quarter to tie the
game on a five yard pass
from Poole to énd Greg Cox.
The ‘Cats increased their
lead to ten points in‘ the third
quarter on a 30-yard field
goal by John Giles and an
other TD pass from Poole to
Cox, this one for eight yards.

“Everything went against
us in. the fourth quarter.”
summed up Coach Smith. “I
was happy with our defense
for three quarters but then
I've never seen anything like
that fourth quarter.”

The ‘Cats had previously
changed their defense during
the week to what Smith calls
his ‘“‘Wildcat’’ defense which
the squad used last year.

“Our pass defense has been
very weak so we switched
back to the 4-4 defense we
used last year.’ said Smith.
Davidson had been employ-
ing a 5.2 defense in the pre-
vious three games this year.

“Our defense worked real.
well for three quarters but
Richmond changed their

blocking assignments in the
last quarter and we weren't
able to adjust.'' Smith said.

“What makes the loss so
painful is that we played
well enough to win but did
not.”

Davidson quarterback Jim-
my Poole had another good
day even‘in defeat as he
completed 19 passes for 193
yards in 29 attempts. That
brings Poole’s total comple-
tions to 58. fourth best in the
nation. Poole’s completion

against North Carolina State
University this week. but
Whittle said the meet was
cancelled.

The Wildcats were to have
run against the Paladins of
Furman University here at 4
p.m. today.

The Paladins are tradition-
ally a powerhouse in cross-
country, and this year they
seem to be as strong as in

recent seasons. The addition
of freshmen on the team
should bolster their chances.
according to Whittle.
“Furman has run a good
many meets.” he said.
“They have a number of
good freshmen on their sub-
sidized team. But they have
not run in a meet in which
the course covered a distance
of five miles a$ ours does.”
