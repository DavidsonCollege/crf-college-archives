Film Committee Features

Six Weeks Of Fine Films

BY BILL AITKEN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The Union Film Committee will begin showing two different films each week be-
ginning April 8 for a six-week’s period. This is a result of the annual Film Festival

which will present six features in conj

On the Beach, Lolita, and A
Taste of Honey headline the
marquee to the regular weekly
features. On the Beach will be
shown the week immediately
following spring break. All of
these movies were in the list of
the top five films for "62.

Tom Wright, chairman of the
Film Committee, told THE DAV-

Puckett Will Give
Test For Deferment

Students not enrolled in the
advanced ROTC program will
be given a chance to delay their
service obligation a while long-
er when the Selective Service
Deferment Test is given at Dav-
idsom April 16.

“A senior who wants to go to
graduate school and isn’t in a
deferred category needs to clear
with the Selective Service,” not-
ed Dr. W. O. Puckett, who will
administer the test. Students
wishing to take the test should
see Puckett for applications.

A student can be deferred by
passing this test with a certain
(unspecified) score or by hav-
ing a certain class standing.
Students desiring to know if
their standing is sufficient to
gain a deferment should see
Puckett.

IDSONIAN in an interview, “We
are going to make this year's
Film Festival six weeks in
length as opposed to last year’s
duration of two days. By doing
this, each student will have a
better chance to see al! six
movies.”

The first feature will be
shown the same week as“On
the Beach. A silent film en
titled Sunrise, it is heralded
by critics as “the most beav-
tiful film ever made.”

Following this will be Rules
of the Game and intolerance.
The latter is by D. W. Griffith,
author of Birth of a Nation
which was shown at last year’s
festival. This movie, also silent,
is an early spectacular combin-
ing four stories in one.

Another “most” film on the
list is Greed by Eric von Stro-
heim. This is the most naturalis-
tic film made, according to
Wright.

Although plans are still ten-
tative, the committee hopes to
include @ Russian film in this
series—possibly Ivan the Ter-
rible.

Each of these films is on the
list of motion picture's all time
top ten features. These films
will be shown twice weekly for
the regular price of 50 cents in
the Morrison Room of the Col-

lege Union. It will be possible

Preceding Stukenbroeder’s
lecture on communist subver-
sion, Dr. E. F. Patterson will
lead a study group on the ideo-
logical beliefs of communism
using C. Wright Mills'’s book
The Marxists. The discussion
group will meet the Wednesday
nights of April 10, 17, and 24.

Everyone interested in Patter-
son’s discussion group should
sign up before spring break in
Chaplain Will Terry's office.

Not lacking when it comes to
action, Gorson has been active
in sit-in demonstrations in An-
napolis, Md., Nashville, Tenn.,
and along Route 40 in Delaware
and Maryland. He is also the
editor of the Liberal Voice.

the world,” Eleanor Roosevelt.
Formed in 1947, ADA has at-
tacked the far-far left and more
commonly the far right.

ADA describes itself as
liberal as opposed to conserva-
tive. “It recognizes change as
the first law of society.” It is
independent in the sense it
is attached to no _ political
party; but it is political since
it tries to achieve its objec-
tives through political pro-
cesses.

On April 25, Dr. Fern Stuken-
broeder will present a series of
lectures on communist subver-
sion in the United States.

Stukenbroeker, after obtain-
ing his PhD in European history,
entered the FBI in 1942 as a
special agent. In 1948, he was
assigned to the headquarters
staff of the FBI. His work has
primarily centered in the in-
vestigation of the Communist
Party, USA, and Soviet espion-
age.

With over 20 years with the
FBI, Stukenbroeker has become
an expert on communism. J. Ed-
gar Hoover, FBI director, has
picked Stukenbroeker to appear
throughout the ‘U.S. as a FBI
speaker on communism.

to buy a series ticket for the
entire Film Festival or to pay
for each film individually.

The Film Festival had _ its
start under impetus of David
Simpson (class of '63) who is
presently in New York directing
films. Since his origination of
the festival, it has become an
annual occurrence on the college
campus.

Wright hopes that attend-
ance at this year’s festival will
be encouraging enough to al-
low the films to run the full
six weeks. However, he noted
that if the films did not work
eut satisfactorily financially,
the festival would be cut
short.

Trying to keep pace with the
need for adequate facilities in
Davidson’s film program, the
Film Committee has recently
purchased a new 35mm cinema-
scope lense. This will increase
the size of the actual photo-
graphs on the screen.

During exams the committee
is considering showing The
Phantom of the Opera House.
The committee is also interest-
ed in knowing if the student
body would be intersted in any
Marlene Dietrich or Douglas
Fairbanks features.

Copeland's Store
To Open Saturday

The biggest part of Pop Cope-
land's icgend will come alive to-
morrow.

The ‘Jungle,’ his Davidson-
renowned emporium that has
as many varieties in the dry-
goods line as a tropical forest
has plants and trees, will open
under his son’s salesmanship.
Creecy Copeland plans as a tem-
porary arrangement to keep the
store open all day on Saturdays.

WwW. C. Copeland’s daughter,
Mary Copeland, proprietor of
Marietta’s Dress Shop, will al-
so help maintain the “Jun-
gle’s” life by keeping it open
from time to time on week-
day afternoons.

Miss Copeland said that she
would have no regular afternoon
times to operate the emporium,
but she also said that anyone
who wanted to buy something
from there could come to her
dress shop. “I will be glad to go
up the street and get anything a
student or anyone else might
want,” she told THE DAVID-
SONIAN.

Miss Copeland made the
fact clear that this rather un-
stable operating arrangement
would be only temporary. “We
will do it this way until we
can find someone to run the
store (on a full time basis),”
she said.

She commented that there
were still a great many legal
details pending on the settle-
ment of the late Rev. Copeland's
estate. The ex-minister, affec-
tionately known to many Dav-
idson folks as “Pop,” passed
away Saturday, March 2.

The family intends to keep
the store open because they
“feel he would want it that

way.”

Eudora Welty, author of Davidson's Book-of-the-Year,
li arrive on campus Tuesday, April 9. Scheduled during her

cussion on Tuesday night.
Miss Welty’'s first appearance

will be at chapel period Tues

day at which time she will pre-

cussion at 9.

Her book, chosen by a faculty-
YMCA committee headed by
junior Bill Ferris of Vicksburg,
Mississippi, is a collection of 25
short stories, based upon her
observations of life in her native
South. She approaches these
stories not only with the inten-
tion of creating a vivid picture
of Southern life, but also of
showing the impact of the cir-
cumstances upon the persons in-
volved.

Dr. J. S. Purcell of David-
son’s English department
writes, “The choice of this
Mississippi writer is to be
applauded on the basis of
regional appropriateness os
well as that of literary excel-
lence.

“Perhaps Eudora Welty ap-
pears at her best in her bland
treatment of the comic and the
pathetic. To her sensitive and
sympathetic eye the two often
blend, subtly reflecting the sen-
sations that her characters are
feeling.”

Miss Welty was born and
raised in Jackson, Mississippi,
where she is living at the pres-
ent time. She attended Mississip-
pi State College for Women and
was graduated from the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin.

She has had seven books pub-
lished during her literary
career, and was the recipient
of a Guggenheim fellowship
and of the Howell Gold Medal
for fiction, presented by the

institute of Arts
and Culture. She is coming
to Davidsen from the Univer-

Piedmont Colleges
Begin Co-Op Plan

The Piedmont University Cen-
ter has been organized and is
now planning its program.

In February, 1962, the David-
son College Trustees approved
the college's membership in the
Organization, which comprises
schools in the Piedmont area
and which has as its purpose, ac-
cording to Davidson College
President D. Grier Martin, the
sponsoring of “any project
which will serve to improve the
progress of the member institu-
tions.”

A. R. Kappel, past president
of Catawba College, has recent-
ly been appointed the executive
director of the center, and its
headquarters have been estab-
lished in Winston-Salem at Rey-
nolda, the Reynolds family's
previous home,

Although the program is still
in its initial planning stages,
Martin outlined for THE DAV-
IDSONIAN possible activities of
the center.

At a greatly reduced cost, out-
standing speakers could be per-
suaded to stay in the area for
four or five days, thus giving
depth to Davidson’s own sched-
ule of speakers and simultan-
eously bringing, possibly for the
first time, distinguished lectur-
ers to the campuses of other
member colleges.

Specialists might also be com:
missioned to teach for a semes-
ter subjects more specialized
than small colleges can normal-
ly afford to provide in their
curricula. A program of artists
or writers-in-residence might be
instituted under such a plan.

Of Weekend Curfew

Curfew for girls at the

At present the rule is admin-
istered by the college authori-
ties; the IFC proposes to assume
responsibility for enforcing the
rule, making it a part of the IFC
body of regulations.

The rule provides that girls be
out of fraternity houses by mid-
night on week nights and by
1:30 Sunday mornings. On dance
weekends, the times are
extended to 5 on Saturday morn-
ing and 3 Sunday morning.

Under the IFC regulation,
there would be fines of $25
per fraternity for each viola-
tion, with a minimum of $15
to be paid by the member
involved (the fraternity could
make up the rest, or the in-
dividual could pay the entire
$25). This IFC proposal will
be presented to the next
meeting of the faculty com-
mittee on fraternities.

Election of officers for the
IFC will be April 15; by that
time, all fraternities will have
completed their elections of
representatives. The new IFC
will work with the old on Spring
Frolics, April 19-21.

senior class president. He was
| elected on Thursday along with
| Joel Morrisett, vice-president;
| Hill Wellford, secretary-treasur-
er; and Walter MacDonald and
Ralph Small, representatives.

McGuirt barely edged his five
opponents for the top spot. He
had 50 votes followed by Morri-
sett with 46, Wellford with 44,
Small with 43, McDonald with
| 42, and Bob Ivey with 41.

John Barrow was elected
president of next year’s
junior class. Also elected were
Charlie Marshall, vice-presi-
dent, and Bruce Swain, rep-
resentative. Barrow polled 37
votes in Tuesday's voting to
edge Marshall with 35 and
Swain with 29.

The rising sophomore class
president is Dave Hardeman. He
edged Arnie Snider in the bal-

sophomore council representa-
tive.

On the first day of balloting
for Student Council positions
there were 26. rising seniors, 20
rising juniors, and 18 rising
sophomores.

McGuirt, a Sigma Chi, is now
serving as second vice-president
of the Student Council. He and
his wife are both from Lumber-
ton, N. C. He is a pre-med ma-
jor and is a member of the var-
sity football team.

Barrow also serves on the cur-
rent Student Council, as sopho-
more class representative. He is
a member of Phi Delta Theta
and is from Winston-Salem.

Hardeman, from Fort Valley,
Ga., was on the first semester
Dean’s List. He is also a mem-
ber of Philanthropic Literary

« Society.
The Elections Board met
Thursday afternoon to review

this year's elections. Several
Suggestions to improve next
year’s voting procedures were
made. They wil! be given to the
Student Council next month.

Student Body President
Danny Carrell was admittedly
disappointed over the turnout
of voters, “Of course, nothing
is going to bring any more
people out around here,” stat-
ed Carrell. “This lackadaisical
attitude of some people is
really pitiful,” he edded.

Carrell seemed pleased with
the overall conduct of the elec-
tions; however, he had hoped
to draw more voters with a
novel system using elections
jcards. Each student was sup-
posed to secure one of these
cards to be punched every time
he voted.

The Selected Short | ejections were finally completed .

proximately 650 students had
cards, although no election this
month drew nearly that. many
voters. Duvall said that some-
one even came to him on Tues-
day of this week asking for a
card for the first time.

Carrell, who originated the
idea for the cards, said he
thought they served their pur-
pose. “It certainly expedited
voting for those who wanted to
vote,” he said. Carrell added he
felt that those who really want-
ed to vote would go to the
trouble to procure a_ voting
card.

When asked why there was
no voting on Wednesday of
this week as scheduled, Duvall
replied, “There just weren‘t
any ballots printed.” A mis-
understanding about the
mimeographing of ballots
caused the voting to be post-
poned until Thursday.

Incoming Student President

John Spratt said he had some
definite changes in mind to im-
prove next year’s. elections;
however, he said it would be up
to the new Student Council to
see these improvements made.

Spratt said he was in favor
of keeping the voting card sys-
tem in effect next year. “If you
really want to take an interest
in things, you can go to the
trouble to pick up a card,”
Spratt said. He added, however,
that he hoped to make it more
convenient for students to se
cure a voting card next year.

Spratt and the other student
body officers will be in install-
ed on April 22.
