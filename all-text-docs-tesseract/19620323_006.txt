NEW PASTOR ARRIVES

Harper Begins Duties

The Rev. Curtis P. Harper,
Jr., began his duties as minister
of the Davidson College Presby-
terian Church this past Monday.
Harper comes to Davidson from
the Chesterbrook Presbyterian
Church in Falls Church, Va.

Harper is an alumnus of Dav-
idson College, having graduated
with the class of 1950. While
here he was a member of the
Phi Delta Theta social fraterni-
ty.

Upon graduation from David-
son, he attended Union Theolo-
gical Seminary in Richmond,
where he received his BD de-
gree in 1953. He then entered
the navy as a chaplain, volun-

teering for service in Korea, but
was sent instead to the Philip-
pines. After completing serv-
ice, Harper was asked to serve
at the Chesterbrook Church. He
has been there since 1956. While
there, he found time to do grad-
uate work and received a ThM
degree from Union in 1958.

Harper received his call from
the church here in January of
this year.

The Harpers are living in the
church home next to the College
Infirmary. Mrs. Harper said
that both of them were anxious
for students to drop in when-
ever they wished. “Curtis and I
both want to meet as many
students as possible,” she said.

men out of third floor Watts
this year to make room for the
freshmen. I may even have to
go to the first floor next year,”
she threatened.

From the traffic in and out
of Mrs. Moore's office the past
week, it seemed that plenty of
people were worrying about
room space for next year. More |
than a few had been so eager to;
keep the same room that they
had this year that they rushed
in and forgot to bring their yel-
low cards from the bursar's of-
fice. Or so they said. But Mrs.
Moore told them, “Nobody gets
a room without a card.”

LADY LUCK :

The real worry was for stud-
ents drawing numbers in order
to get a better room for next
year. For the past three days,
lady luck has been busy in one
way or another for each student
who drew the number that told
whether or not he had to climb
an extra flight of stairs next
year. One rising sophomore
looked at his number 175 and
moaned, “Man, I'm already
panting from those stairs I
know I'll be climbing.”

The drawing began on Tues-
day, and right away one student
informed his roommate, “We've
got number 40, and there are
20 more people ahead of us.”
And so it has been all week, ,
with roommates hopefully sur-
veying their situation and keep-
ing their fingers crossed about
where they could put their pin-
ups next year.

WINKIN’, BLINKIN’ AND NOD are only three of the many
students that have succumbed to the soporific breezes of early

spring. The symptoms of this chronic ailment are heaviness of
the eyelids, inability to hold the head in en upright position and
a failure fo concentrate on the gems of wisdom uttered each
day by professors. It appears thet this is only the incubstion
period of the sickness that strikes the campus each year, causing
those stricken to seek the fresh air of the out-of-doors and the
sunshine provided on the dormitory lawns. (Staff Photo by Me-

addition to discussing explora-

A few stammers brought us
to the parlor where we assured
Miss Sloan that we did not know
how to kindle a fire that quickly
in the old trash-filled stove.
Wasn't there something about
a stamp to sell?

Miss Sloan returned with
an armful of boxes and an af-
ternoon full of stories, both of
which she began to open to
us.

Miss Sloan produced an an-
cient stamp album, its pages in
French and marred with little
rectangular holes where some
of its stamps had been, and told
how the collection began with
this book. It was sold to her
father by Jules Dufour, from

Sigma Phi Epsilon
Wins District Prize

The Davidson chapter of Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon was awarded the
Outstanding Chapter of the
Year Award for district five by
the two governors of the fifth
district at the Carolina’s Sig Ep
Ball in the Hotel Charlotte last
Saturday night, March 17.

The fifth district contains the
nine SPE chapters in North and
South Carolina. These chapters
competed among themselves for
the award on the basis of first
semester of this year and last
semester of last year.

The award was based on in-
ternal chapter operation, such
as the use of committees, rush-
ing, and scholarship, and on par-
ticipation in campus activities
by the individual members of
the fraternity and the fraternity
as a whole.

The winning of this award
now gives the Davidson Sig Ep
chapter a chance for winning a
national outstanding chapter
award.

The Davidson Sig Eps also
won the singing contest at the
ball under the direction of
Doug Heidt.

Switzerland, while he was a
student here in the early
Ninety’s.

So, thankful to M. Dufour, we
now sorted through a sheaf of
old envelopes, patriotic covers
and Civil War stamps. There
were old postmarks of Davidson
College, before the days of the
Davidson, N. C., P. O. There
were some of the earliest stamp-
ed envelopes.

And carefully sealed in plas-
tic jackets were the covers of
the Confederacy. Some were
homemade affairs, and Miss
Sloan unfolded them to show us
the addresses on both sides—to
conserve paper. At last she
passed around, with a mixture
of modesty and triumph, what
was once reputed to be the
“rarest cover in the U.S.” It was
postmarked Camden, Miss., June
24. Opposite the C.S.A. “Rose
Stamp” was a picture of Presi-
dent Lincoln.

The picture showed Abe up-
side down, hanging to be
exact. And it was graced by
such endearments as “Abe
Lincoln the Destroyer—He
once split rails, now he hes
split the union,” and “im-
peached and deposed, Tried
and convicted.” Beside Lin-
coin was the terse remark,

FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 1962

Ancient Sloan Collection
Contains Rare Stamps

We were stopped on the porch by the upstairs “just a minute,” and after about
five of them, the door was opened by one of Davidson's

legendary characters, Miss

“The penalty for disregarding
the constitution.”

In the neat hand of the 19th
century were the confident
bravado of the young South:
“The stars and stripes lie in the
dust, Never to rise.” “The South-
ern star is rising.” “The Stars
and Bars shall for ever wave
triumphant.” The copyright was
claimed by a TM&TC, Box 417,
Nashville, Tenn.

How much was the cover
worth? Miss Sloan effused; one
like it, but without the rose
stamp, a rare bird itself, had
brought $80 at a philatelical
convention.
