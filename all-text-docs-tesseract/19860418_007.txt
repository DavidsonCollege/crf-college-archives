The Gods Must Be Crazy entertains, delights

By JENNY LIVINGSTON

“The Gods Must Be Crazy”
could never have been produced
here in America. We have become
so jaded in our outlook and
sophisticated in our film-making
technology that a film of such in-
nocence and originality can no
longer be created in the States.
Our entertainment industry has
grown up and lost its childhood
forever. Thank God for imports
— we can’t make these movies,
but hopefully we can appreciate
them.

It takes a slight effort at the be-
ginning. Having become so ac-
customed to the technical displays
we call movies in this country, we
find it hard to get used to a film in
which the only special effect is an
elementary fast-action technique,
to a film in which people get shot

and don’t blow into pieces before
our eyes, to a film which is edited
poorly and dubbed sloppily. It is
no technical marvel. Most of the
actors aren't even actors; they're
just people.

The movie opens, in fact, with
shots of a clan of Kalahari
bushmen, yes, bushmen, not ac-
tors made up to look like
bushmen, but the real thing. They
are shown carrying on their uto-
pian existence until one day a pilot
drops a Coke bottle out of his
plane and into the lives of the
bushmen. They find hundreds of
uses for this fantastic “gift from
the gods.”

But soon they find themselves
dependent on it and begin to fight
over it. The head of the clan de-
cides that it is an evil thing and de-
cides to drop it off the edge of the

world where it can do no more
harm. The symbolism here is
pretty obvious. This is not a film
of sophisticated metaphors.

From there, the scene changes
abruptly to a city in the south, “the
civilized world.” Again, it’s an
obvious juxtaposition for an obvi-
ous effect. The technique is com-
pletely guileless, but no less valid.
In fact, after having been jerked
around by so many more subtle
movies, I really appreciated the
honesty of this film.

The acting, too, is extraordi-
narily honest. The main character,
the bushman N!xau, is completely
untrained as an actor. His emo-
tions are pure and unfettered by
method. The director 1s to be com-
mended for his minimal interfer-
ence with N!xau’s natural talent.
The other major actors are perhaps

more experienced, but they are
just as open and honest. They do
not impose themselves on their
characters; they embrace them.

The acting is not limited to
people. Excellent performances
are turned in by the animals of the
Kalahari, one baboon in particu-
lar. But the best performer in a
non-human role is “the Antic-
hrist,” a land rover with a mind
and personality of its own. Proba-
bly the funniest scene in the movie
involves the car in an all-out battle
with its driver, Dr. Steyn.

The humor is very physical,
even slapstick. It harks back to the
days of Laurel and Hardy and the
Keystone Cops. It was funny
then, and it still works. The oldest
bits are invested with new life.

Indigo Girls thrive on unique style

Feb. 8, 1986 issue of the Atlanta
Journal/Constitution and is used

Editor's note: article by

perform two shows in the 900
Room Saturday night at 10 and
11230.

“7 don't want to watt for heaven

I can find what I need right here

on Earth this time.

Too many people want to watt for

heaven

But if you can't feel it here you

won't feel it there anyway.”

— From “Holy City” by Indigo
Girls

For the record, it’s Indigo
Girls, not the Indigo Girls, and
they’re finding what they want in
Auanta — a faithful, if small, fol-
lowing.

Also for the record, which
doesn’t have a title yet, all of the
songs on it will be their own, and
it should be released during the
summer.

Both Indigo Girls, Emily
Saliers and Amy Ray, are getting
sick of the blues symbolism at-
tached to the name. “I just thought
it was catchy,” said the 21-year-
old Ray.

“It's blue and it’s deep,” said
22-year-old Saliers, laughing. “I
think it has a ring to it.”

They’ve known each other
since sixth grade at Laurel Ridge
Elementary School in Decatur,
Georgia, and they used to hate
each other. “I was jealous of
Emily because she was already
writing songs and playing guitar. I
wasn't writing anything, | was
practicing three chords,” Ray
said.

“Yeah, I was writing songs
about the sky and the clouds,”
Saliers joked.

After getting over their aver-
sion to each other, they got to-
gether in I 1th grade at Shamrock
High School. Their first gig was a
PTA meeting. After playing

“open mike” nights at Good OV
Days in Buckhead and Sandy
Springs as the B-Band (“It stood
for a bad word, but that was a bad
image,” Saliers said.) and Saliers
and Ray, they went on to bigger
things such as playing on Bourbon
Street sidewalks and the late Pro-
fessor Longhair’s
Tipetina’s in New Orleans.

“We made enough to take the
trolley home and get some dinner.

now-defunct

We thought we were great. We
were really bad,” Saliers said in
retrospect.

They returned to Atlanta and
Emory University in 1983, where
Saliers graduated = with sa
bachelor’s degree in English and
Ray is pursuing her bachelor’s de-
gree in religion and English.

And they've become accom-
plished enough as musicians and
songwriters to have a cadre of fans
following them from club to club
in the Virginia-Highland, Emory
and Inman Park areas. They call
themselves “the cheapest band in
Atlanta,” and Cathy Bufford,
manager and booking agent for
the Moonshadow Saloon, said she
loves working with them. “We've
used them a lot, they’re reasona-
ble, very flexible, enthusiastic
and a lot of fun.”

They've been the opening act
at the Moonshadow for such nota-
ble performers as Loudon Wain-
wright III, Dave Mason, John
Sebastian and Donovan. They've
done the background music for the
Theater Emory production of Sam
Shepard’s “Curse of the Starving
Class” and shared the bill with
“Shepard Shorts” during Theatre
Emory’s Rush Hour and Late
Night Theatre.

The music Saliers writes 1s a
cross between mellow rock and
jazz, Ray calls her music “intense
and driving” and a few of her
songs are heavy on religious im-
agery. But the real treat is their
voices, which are best illustrated
by their live a cappella version of

Paul Simon's “American Dream.”

They have a_ self-produced
single out now — with Saliers’
“Crazy Game,” a bluesy jazz song
about love and insecurity, and

“Someone to Come Home,”
Ray's soft rock song about break-
ing away from motherly ties (with
a vague reference to the second
coming of Jesus) — which re-
ceived airplay on WRAS, WRFG
and WREK radio stations in At-
lanta.

Buoyed by their single's and
live shows’ successes, they de-
cided to work toward a themed
album that will feature only origi-
nal material and highlight their
harmony.

“The album is going to focus
on the harmony because that’s re-
ally our forte,” Saliers said

“It gives us the chance to inter-
twine our different styles. We
have more room to do a lot of dif-
ferent songs,” Ray added

The Indigos are working with

producer Frank French (a member
of Atlanta band Drivin’ and
Cryin’), who recently came out
with an album of instrumental
music called The New World,
which he produced in his own
studio. They've been playing
around with the title “Blue Food”
but, Saliers said, “We've pounded
the blue imagery enough. My dad
said we should call it ‘Scratch
Tracks.*"

“We want it to be sort of acon-
cept album. I feel it will hang to-
gether a lot more,” Ray said. “It
will be the Indigo Girls’ sound,
something recognized and
unique.”

“{ think there is something
about us that’s unique, | don't
know what it is, but why do
people come out to hear two

- guitars and two voices?” Saliers

asked. Whatever the answer, they
don't want to change their formula
for success. “We don't want to
make any compromises for com
mercial music. We jut want to do

truly hilarious.

Not all the humor is physical,
however. A lot comes from the
misunderstanding and confusion
involved in crossing cultural
boundaries. As N!xau_ experi-
ences the world outside his clan,
we see everything through his
eyes. We see a car as a loud ani-
mal whose legs go all the way
around instead of up and down.
We see planes as very fast birds.
His naivete is never ridiculed,
only gently exposed.

And that is the nature of the
movie as a whole. Just like N!xau;
it is gentle and innocent and ex-
tremely entertaining. If you didn't
see “The Gods Must Be Crazy” on
Wednesday, your social
calendar for Saturday afternoon at
3:30. This one’s not to be missed

clear

what we do. No Madonna,”
Salhiers said.
“And no Lionel Richie hook

lines,” Ray added.

They'd rather try to keep their
personal touch they said they have
with their audience. Their shows
are characterized by frequent in-
teraction with the audience, hav
ing a good time on stage and walk-
ing around during their breaks to
meet new people in the audience

“tt works to our benefit, 1's
easier and casier to get jobs. It's
gotten to the point where people
call us and tell us about new places
opening up,” Ray said. They book
their own dates in town because
they don’t want to sign up with a
talent agent. “That just wouldn't
work,” Ray said.

“We want to do iton our own
and do it now,” Saliers added
“We don't want to wail five years
