ALUMNI MEETS PLANNED

Alumni Are Enthusiastic Over
Plans for Founders’ Day

Davidson's first alumni magazine will
make its appearance the first week in
Aprit; as a part of the celebration of
Founders’ Day, April 12. The magazine
will be published just before the
Founders’ Day dinners which are to be
held on the 12th, in order to stimulate
interest in the meetings,

The magazine will be 24 pages in
length, and will include the details of
the Centennial program, a story on the
Founders’ Day‘ celebration, pans for
commencement, stories of interest
about the faculty and student body,
an article on sports at Davidson, alumni
marriages, deaths, and personals. The
publication will be illustrated with pic-
tures of the campus and buildings.

Thirteen alumni chapters have made
definite plans for meetings, either on
Founders' Day or shorttv thereafter.
Speakers from the college will be sent
to a number of these meetings.

Professor A. Currie, of the polirical
science department, will speak to the
alumni of Greensboro and the vicistity
at a dinner at the King Cotton Hotel
at 6:45 on April 12. Mr. T. D Dupuy
is president of the Greensboro chapter,
and Mr. L. L. McAlister is secretary
and treasurer. .

Captain Norton G. Pritchett, director
of athletics, and Coach “Doc” New-
ton will speak to the alumni of Win-

_ . ston-Salem_on_the night of April 12.

The place and time of the meeting has
not been definitely set. Mayor George
Coan is president of this local group,
and Mr. J. Harold McKeithen is sec-
retary and treasurer.

plans for meetings, but which have

vo not arranged speakers, are Atlanta,

Orlando, Fla., Charlotte, Gastonia,
Greenville, S. C., Jacksonville, Fla.,
Raeford, Rowan County, Staunton, Va.,
Washingnton, and Wilmington.

A speaker for th® program at Da-
vidson has not yet been selected. The
address will be made at. the chapel
oe and it is probable that a half-

holiday will be given to the students
on that day. -Sofne kind of musical
program is being planned for the after-
noon of April 12.

Station officials at WBT, Charlotte,
have been unable to determine whether
they will have a vacant time on their
schedule for the Founders’ Day pro-
gram-or not. Definite plans about the
radio will be announced in the forth-
coming issue of the magazine.

Alumni have been enthusiastic in
their response to the idea of a Found-
ers’ Day for Davidson. It is expected
that the event will be an annual! affair
for the college. Three years remain
before the celebration of the hundredth
anniversary of the college, which will
take place in 1937.
