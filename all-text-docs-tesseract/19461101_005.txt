Enough of this, let’s talk about

records!

Anyone who saw on the screen
this summer the Cole Porter biog-
raphy, “Night and Day,” can well
understand why such a tidal wave
of Portér albums has hit the record
shops. Personally I think many
of these albums should have been
done long ago. Now, however, the
record fan who enjoys the smooth
sophistication that is Cole Porter |
has a wide range to choose from.

It’s hard to make a choice be-
tween the keyboard wizardry of |
Eddy Duehin and the wonderful ar- |
rangements of David Rose as to}
which of these two artists is best
qualified to present Cole Porter.
A reissue of the Columbia album,
“Duchin Plays Cole Porter,” is on
