NOW & THEN

Self-selection changes
over the past 10 years

By Mary Tow es ALLISON
Staff writer

Everyone’ knows __ that
Davidson thrives on tradition. It
ties us to the past and gives us a
little comfort in the fact that at least
somethings will never change. Self
Selection — perhaps the most
unique party that Davidson has to
offer — is no eXception to that
rule. Fraternity pledges have been
streaking Patterson Court for years,
and girls who choose to self select
come prepared to drown in cheap
champagne. However,. over the
decade some things have changed,
although the general idea of the
event — to celebrate with new
found friends in uncommon ritual
— has stayed the same.

In 1987, Patterson Court
looked a little different than it does
now. Spencer House held Conner’s
place on the court, and two of five
co-ed eating houses—Emanon and
PAX—were struggling to stay
afloat. In a Davidsonian article
about ‘87s Self Selection, Holly
Sparks, the president of PAX com-
mented on Emanon’s inevitable

fold and her hope for the future of
the co-ed eating houses: “We’re
sorry about what may happen to
Emanon, but we don’t feel that
being the only co-ed house is go-
ing to hurt us . . . co-ed eating will
not die out at Davidson.” As it
stands now, the Commons is the
only co-ed eating experience in
existence and the future of any
such organization looks grim. Last
April, a: group of students peti-
tioned for the revival of co-ed eat-
ing houses on the court, but lack of
interest was stronger than any stu-
dent sentiment to change the Court.

A decade ago, Kappa Sig was

‘off campus and gaining popularity

for their renegade reputation.
Pledges of the fraternity turned to
it because it seemed the members
were those who were unhappy with
the current options on the Court,
but looking forward to moving on
campus in 88.

If anything, it seems that Self

* Selection, though wrought with the

dangers of any big party night on
the Court, was a power play for
both the sexes. The girls, though
wet, dressed in their oldest sweats
and most protective ponchos, were

at least clothed, while their vulner-
able pledge-friends braved the ten
degree temperatures — never mind
the wind chill — and loved it.
Davidson’s twisted tradition of
making ice cubes out of the pledges
is indeed memorable, so it’s no
surprise that this tradition
continures.

Friday night everyone and
anyone danced on tables, chairs,
benches, doused each other with
champagne and water — whatever
happened to be within reach. With

Last night or last decade? It’s hard to tell
sometimes. Ten years ago, Self Selection
was held on a weeknight. Although the
night wisely has been moved to a Friday,
the antics and all-night celebrations are
the same. At left Warner Hall’s in-
coming class of ’87 get wet and bond.
Above, a few ’87 SPE pledges pose in
front of their favorite herd of cattle, a
pledge activity (we hope). Other pranks
that year included SAER’s streaking
Richardson dorm and Spencer’s holding
a keg party in the 24-hour room.

the new Patterson Court rule ban-
ning glass bottles at parties, Rusk
girls filled liter bottles with
champagne’s bubbly brew, while
Warner Hall opted for a new twist
on getting their girls messy with
shaving cream. Really, why waste
Bi-Lo’s best cheap variety?
Warner Hall and Rusk had an
even split of 61 girls in both houses,
while Conner pulled through with
31. The fraternities reported an
average number of pledges for the
semester. So, itseems that Patterson

Court is alive and well, but Holly
Sparks words are somewhat sober-
ing.

She was incredibly optimistic
about the future of co-ed eating
houses, and the passing of the de-
cade witnessed their downfall.

Perhaps party goers should
take warning. With the ever-chang-
ing alcohol policy, the banning of

the kegs, and omnipresent liability

worries, it appears that the Court
may be in more trouble than we
wish to admit.

Christmas movies sing, surprise, and scare

Scream

This movie is terrifying. Not
only because the psycho killer
could give Stephen King chills,
but because it makes the viewer
laugh as he or she watches a long
list of innocent and beautiful teen
bodies ripped to shreds. This is its
intent, as it is a “parody” of every
horror movie we have ever seen.
However, the parody does not go
far enough. It uses the Natural
Born Killers method of using
mockery and satire as an excuse to
spew blood and enact brutal grue-
some murder all in the name of a
social commentary on “teens to-
day.” Itis fun to watch though, and
filmmaker Wes Craven (the punch
line of the “parody” aspect) juxta-
poses old horror movies with his
current nightmare brilliantly. But
a pointed satire, no. B —

Mars Attacks

Tim Burton weaves his
twistedly funny movie magic with
this one. As a parody of the recent
Independence Day, this film works
in creating characters, who lack
any development whatsoever and,
in the face of impending doom, are
stupidly optimistic about events
changing their world—namely
little green men from Mars. Dur-
ing the movie, several storylines

unwind, but surpris-
ingly, they donotcon-
veniently connect like
the narrative of Inde-
pendence Day. The
heros (a grungy teen-
age boy andhis grand- |
mother) are unlikely, é
and the victims are,
in most cases, joy-
fully incinerated by
the aliens’ laser guns.
This film derives
most of its humor as a
parody. The biggest

problem, which is often the big-
gest problem with Burton’s films,
is that the movie lacks a good story.
Burton creates fantastic worlds and
creative characters (and creatures),
but he forgets, all to often, the true

essence of movie magic, a good
story. B

Evening Star
Yes, a tearjerker. Evening
Star, like its predecessor Terms of

Entertainment Weekly

Endearment, is a story of growing
up and dealing with life—and
death. The center character, Au-
rora Greenway (Shirley Maclaine),
shines with her Texas charm and
loving durability. She fights to
kept her family and herself to-
gether. Although this movie moves
slowly at times and tries to do too
much in a two hour period (too
many characters die; too many
characters have traumas), it suc-
ceeds in centering the story around
one character, Aurora, and does a
beautiful job, watching her grow,
fail, and triumph. B+

Evita

Truly, this was an unexpect-
edly amazing film. Although, I
must confess, I’ve never enjoyed
Andrew Lloyd Weber’s rock-op-
era melodrama and glitz, Evita,
due to Madonna’s surprisingly
mature singing and the rich music
and breathtaking visuals, became
a spectacular experience. But this
is not what is best about Evita.
No—what sparkled, what made the
film worth seeing, was the subtlety
of character which Madonna (and
I could hardly believe it) gave Eva
Perén. It seemed Madonna’s emo-
tional characterization is at its fin-
est when she can express herself
through song. She acts more con-
fident, more honestly through song.
This film was the perfect medium
to catch Madonna’s talents at their
best. A-_

The People vs. Larry Flint

The People vs. Larry Flint
documents the life, legal troubles,
and personal demons of publish-
ing magnate, Larry Flynt (Woody
Harrelson). Flynt is most famous
as the publisher of Hustler maga-
zine which he started as a news
letter for his go-go bar in Cincin-
nati in the early seventies. The
local popularity of the news letter,
which featured his dancers posing
naked, inspired him to try to create
aniche in the pornography market
by creating a po’ boy’s Playboy.

As the title suggests, Flynt
soon encountered legal obstacles
to the distribution of his magazine
which was markedly more explicit
than Playboy. In Cincinnati and
Georgia, he faced trial on obscen-
ity charges and was sentenced to
jail for publishing Hustler. Flynt
turned the cases into first amend-
ment tests all the while milking
maximum publicity from the tri-
als. In Georgia Flynt was shot
outside the courthouse and para-
lyzed from the waist-down.

A concurrent story line in-
volves Flynt’s marriage and love
for Althea (Courtney Love). Their
relationship presents Flynt as acar-
ing and tender-hearted sentimen-
talist capable of feelings beyond
the carnal.

Harrelson’s performance was
impassioned without being overly
