Dr. Harding Recalls Years 3
of Experience At Davidson |Screen “Massacre”

Has Been Professor of Greek and
German for Nearly Fifty
Years

DAVIDSON GRADUATE

Many Changes Effected Since
Arrival at College

Kew men of today can boast of a
record of faithful service in the field
of education as long as that of Dr.
C. R. Harding, professor of Greek at
Davidson College.

For the past fifty years Dr. Harding
has specialized in. the teaching ‘of
Greek and German in various schools
throughout North Carolina-and Vir-
ginia. In 1888, after teaching at Hamp-
cen-Sidney College, he accepted a po-
sition as professor of Greek here at
Davidson and in this capacity he has
taught since that time.

Born at Charlotte, Dr. Harding made
the most of the poor educational .con-
ditions which existed at that time, and
at the early age of fifteen he entered
Davidson College as a freshman. Ap-
parently, freshing or hazing was the
order of the day, and Dr. Harding
being the youngest in the college at
that time, received no little share of
the events that followed.

One event particularly vivid in his
mind was the “smoker” that several
sophs decided to give ‘for his benefit.
Taking their pipes and plenty of to-
bacco, they protceded to puff and blow
up a veritable cloud of smoke, which
soon engulfed all occupants of the
room, Unaccustomed to such a dense
atmosphere, and noticing a sudden
opening in the doorway, Dr. Harding
made a break for liberty which far
surpassed any previous attempt at
speed records and soon he was safely
hidden in the shelter of a nearby wood-
pile. However, he was not destined
to stay for long as the sophs, “hot on
the trail,” soon discovered his pres-
ence. Ina very short time they start-
ed such a furious barrage with chips
and other missiles, that he again broke
from cover and ran. Finding, however,
that the sophs could run too, he des-
perately sought the shelter of the vil-
lage church. Fortunately, the village
choir was practicing for Sunday’s’serv-
ice and attracted by sounds that at
least promised refuge and solace for
the disturbed and distracted, Dr. Hard-
ing made his way to the choir loft
and safety.

Another humorous incident was re-
called by Dr. Harding, of the fresh-
man who, late one evening, heard the
footsteps of one walking through the
corridors of Chambers and, being an-
xious to take revenge upon an older
student, whom he had reason to be-
lieve to be the person approaching, he
concealed himself behind the door un-
til a form partially appeared. The
freshman then yelled loudly in the per-
son’s ear and shook him with all his
might until he saw the gray whiskers
of a very dignified professor whom he
knew very well.. Realizing his mistake,
the freshman tried in vain to utter an
apology, but the incident had rendered
him speechless. The professors’ aston-
ishment can well be imagined, but
eventually he understood and uttering
a kindly laugh he continued upon his
way, leaving a very bewildered fresh-
man.

According to Dr. Harding, the col-
lege before the war was nothing like
the college of today for numbers, but
had a good representation as compared
with other schools at that time. The
campus consisted only of the old
Chambers Building, two society halls,
Oak and Elm Rows, and the old chapel,
which is now known as Shearer Hall.
However, in 1868 through the efforts
of the student body, various walks and
drives on the campus were laid out,
and later grass, trees and shrubbery
were added for its beautification, The
great circular driveway on the cam-
pus, which is an exact mathematical
curve except for a short distance near
the gate, was planned and calculated
especially by Davidson math students,
As time went on, various other classes
contributed to the campus in an hon-
est effort to improve its appearance.
Evidently they succeeded in their ob-
jective, for now we have one of the
most beautiful campuses in North
Carolina, and as Dr. Harding says, “is
quite a contrast to the campus that he
lived upon during his career at David-
son.”

Noted Educator

Dr. C. R. Harding, who for al-
most fifty years has been profes-

the college.

Phi Spclsty Discusses
Policies of Roosevelt

The Philanthropic Literary Society
discussed the policies of the Roosevelt
administration in its regular meeting
Tuesday night. Speakers were W. L.
Fugate, C. F. McNeill and George
Hornbeck.

Fugate gave a resume of the devel-
opments of the “New Deal” in 1933
and laid particular stress on the agri-
cultural aid involved. “The NRA,”
stressed Fugate, “is particularly rad-
ical in its policy that any thorough
recovery must come from the ground
up—must start with agriculture. ‘This
ploicy is diametrically opposed to the
policy of former regimes who have
maintained that the bankers, the rail-
roads and the big industrialists are re-
sponsible for prosperity.”

“The Monetary Policy of the Pres-
ent Administration” was the topic of
McNeil’s talk. He showed how infla-
tion favored the debtor class and was
repulsive to the creditor class. “The
present administration,” said McNeil,
“seems to be inclined to aid the little
man—the debtor.”

“Will the NRA work?” George
Hornbeck seemed to believe it would
in his discussion of that question. He
stated that its principles were sound
and that barring any unforeseen cal-
amity, the NRA would carry America
back to prosperity.

Students-in the department of geol-
ogy at the Pacifi¢ College will make
a trip to the Mohave Desert region
and Death Valley during the spring
vacation to study soil and rock forma-

tions.

and Felix Gee will be delighted to
know that both are doing nicely and
are expected to return to the campus
soon.

Hayworth suffered an attack of ap-
pendicitis while taking a shower in the
basement of Watts Hall. He was taken
to the Infirmary and later to his home
in High Point where his appendix
was removed. Bob Smith, roommate
of Hayworth, stated that he stood the
operation well and is now on the road
to a speedy recovery.

Gee, who has also been on the sick
list, was taken to Charlotte for treat-
ment, His malady was first branded
as spinal meningitis, but examination
proved the rumors to be entirely un-
founded.

Mae West has been chosen to select
the girls who make up the beauty sec-

tion of Louisiana Tech’s yearbook.

Survey Shows Frat.
Men Get Better Grades

Scholarship ratings of fraternity men
at Davidson College show a higher av-
erage than those of non-fraternity, ac-
cording to a survey just released by
the National Interfraternity Confer-
ence, an organization of sixty-nine
fraternities the United

leading in

States.

Not only does the scholastic average
of the fraternity men rank higher than
the non-fraternity in a majority of the
150 colleges studied, but the rating is
higher than the all-men’s

The total undergraduate enrollment
of the institutions in the report num-
bers approximately 250,000, of whom
nearly 70,000 are members of the 2,104
chapter groups of the Greek-letter or-
ganizations in the Interfraternity Con-
ference,

Outstanding among the facts re-
vealed by the 1933 survey is that all-
men’s averages have risen in 79 per
cent of the institutions of the country,
denoting an increasing amount of at-
tention to academic objectives on the
part of undergraduate men.

The best performances of the year
were made at the Universities of Wis-
consin, Michigan, Penn State, Syra-
cuse, Alabama, and Mississippi. The
most marked scholastic improvement,
according to geographic sections, was
made by the Southern group. Second
in improvement was the Pacific Coast
section.

According to the report, the younger
fraternities still outstrip the older,
scholastically.. The most steady im-
provement is found among larger na-
tional groups and is attributed to the
more extensive programs carried on by
these organizations. No-internal evi-
dence of the study is found substanti-
ating the belief that disciplinary con-
trol has aided in solution of the schol-
arship problem.

Scholastic first places in the 156 in-
stitutions reporting, this are distributed
among 52.members of the Interfrater-
nity Conference, the widest distribution
ever obtained. Greater interest in
scholarship and the steady improve-
ment in the past five years are remoy-
ing much of the grounds for criticism
directed toward fraternities and fra-
ternity systems, the scholarship com-
mittee believes.

Fraternity Publication
Compliments Arbuckle

A picture of Dr. Howard B. Ar-

buckle, head of the Davidson Chemis-
try Department, appears in the Janu-
ary issue of “Banta’s Greek Ex-
change,” inter-fraternity journal. Un-
derneath the..picture were the cut-
lines, “He retired after twenty years
of service as Grand Councilor of Pi
K. A.”
With Dr. Arbuckle’s voluntary re-
tirement from the office of Grand
Councilor there was effected a change
in the name of the highest position in
the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Charlotte Community
Concert Drive Closes

The membership drive for the Char-
lotte Community Concert Association
closed last week. The campaign for
new members in Davidson was under
the supervision of Mrs. P. H, Gwynn.

Twenty memberships were taken by
the students and townspeople during
the drive.

The Charlotte organization is 4
branch of the Community Concert As-
sociation, whose purpose is to make
concerts possible on a basis which
eliminates all financial risk on the part
of the artist or the person sponsoring
the performance.

The association is organized on a
membership basis. Each student mem-
ber pays dues of two dollars per year
which entitles him to attend all of the
concerts that are presented by the as-
sociation each season without addition-
al expense. The committee appointed
to select the artists has secured Rich-
ard Crooks, the famous tenor. For the
other two performances, the artists
have not been secured, :

Much effort has been put forth to
get either the London String Quartet
or the New York String Quartet for
one of the concerts. This association
has proven itself to be well worth-
while and the members derive much
benefit from it.

Davidson Again on Air

lege before the eyes of the public.

On January 10, the feature of the
program was a talk by Captain N. G.
Pritchett on athletics at Davidson. In
this talk Captain Pritchett directed his
remarks mainly to the alumni, praising
them for their reasonable and sympa-
thetic attitude toward athletics here at
Davidson. He also gave statistics on
the number of men engaged in varsity,
freshman, and intramural sports, prov-
ing conclusively that the intramural
