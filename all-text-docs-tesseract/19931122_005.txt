B&E gone: were S g0 for midnight munchies?

Student night-owls
have to be creative
if they don't want
to go hungry.

By Court McBryde

Last spring one of Davidson
College students’ favorites, Bacon
and Eggs, closed, leaving students’
options for a midnight munchies
meal fewer and farther away.

Bacon and Eggs shut down
when their lease ran out on
McDonald’s property. Because
McDonald’s does not like to share
property with restaurants due to
the threat of competition for busi-
ness, B & E’s lease was not re-
newed.

Waffle House employee in
Mooresville, Clarence Mayo,
Claims that Waffle House’s busi-
ness has increased significantly
since the closing of B & E.

Like Bacon and Eggs, The
Waffle House is open 24 hours, 7
days 4 week.

Mayo says there are a lot of
Davidson students that make the
drive to the Waffle House “mostly
during the week from 11,p.m.-2

m.” However, he encourages all
students to come up and eat at any

ime.
__ ‘Mayo, who worked for B & E
before it closed, says, “The stu-
dents were not hard to serve; they
were great!” However, he claims
that “although the Waffle House
doesn’t have the variety of Bacon
and Eggs, the quality of food is
better.”
Denny’s,
Mooresville, is another substitute.
The restaurant is open 24 hours, 7
days a week as well. However,

they said their business has not °

been affected one way of another
from the closing of B & E and they
do not see a lot of students.

For those students not want-
ing to travel to Mooresville, there
is the Buttery and Beanery, which
opened in 1977, located on the way
to the Lake Campus. They are

openevery day except Tuesday for ‘}

breakfast and lunch. However,
they close at 3 p.m. Saturday to
Tuesday and at S p.m. Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.

Linda Holthouser, employee
of B & B, said they. see some stu-
dents and faculty. During Home-
coming and Parents! Weekend a
lot of alumni and families dined at
the B & B. Holthouser claims that
the closing of Bacon and Eggs has
not made a difference in their busi-

located in.

ness, but “we would always like to

Dean Rusk speaker McNeill Smith discusses Estonia on Wednesday in the 900 Room. He predicted
that all Russian troops would depart the former Soviet Republic by the end of the year.

Attorney McNeill Smith "reinvents" Estonia.

By Leigh Rawdon

Wandering empty banquet
halls for leftover sweets, attorney
McNeill Smith made an impres-
sion in post-communist Estonia.

“I went around eating those
desserts because I didn’t want to
waste,” said a grinning Smith
Wednesday in the 900 Room in
response to the introduction.

Smith did make an impres-
sionon the independent Balticstate,
though his influence extended far
beyond the dessert table.

The North Carolina lawyerand
ex-state legislator recounted his
experience in Estonia when the
American Bar Association sent him
to “reinvent the government” for a
free society. His tales were per-
sonal and accessible to a diverse
audience of a few students and a

majority of community adults, in- ©

cluding trustees, lawyers, and the
college president.

Smith had heard that his time
in Estonia would be like “taking
law to the lawless,” but he found
the rumor was “absolutely not
true.” The Estonians had theirown

style of government—“unless it is
permitted, it is forbidden.”

All but one of the legislators
Smith worked with were schooled
in the Soviet Union, at a university
that had no pencil sharpeners. The
priceless nature of the electronic
pencil sharpener he donated, indi-
cates only one of the unusual ten-
dencies he discovered.

Before he left, Smith called
AAA toask for maps of “Estonia.”
Though it was a free state, the
AAA agent said, “We don’t have
city maps. Is that in Missouri?”
Estonia is smaller than North Caro-
lina, and about 40% woodlands.

Why has Estonia survived?
The language, said Smith. He at-
tributes the survival of the lan-
guage in part to music, which was
never outlawed.

“Anew constitution, written in
1992, requires that anyone apply-
ing for citizenship must learn 800
words of the language, a number
lowered from 1,500. Some Esto-
nians, though, insist on speaking
Russian, a loyalty born out of the
1940 treaty which granted the Bal-

tic states to Russia.

The treaty led to an existing
problem—the occupation of Rus-
sian troops. When Smith arrived in
Estonia, 800,000 troops occupied
thearea. He announced witha glim-
mer Of excitement that by 1994,
Estonia will not be occupied.

With the most stable currency
of former Russian states, Estonia
has a potentially bright future.
Despite the many showers without
hot water and the meat, potatoes,
and carrots for every meal, Smith
found his time in Estonia valuable.

“I think the effort has been
worth it,” he said.

Smith is a 75 year-old partner
in the Greensboro law firm of

Smith, Helms, Mulliss & Moore. .

He graduated from UNC-Chapel
Hill and Columbia Law School.
During World War Il, he served in
the U.S. Navy. He later served in
the N.C. state house for one term in
‘70 and was a state senator from '72
to '78.

fast foods, similar to those sold at
Waffle House, Denny’s, B & B,
and the late B & E, are available at
the Outpost.

Says one sophomore: “I was
sad to see the B & E close, but I’d
rather go to the Outpost because
you can get the same type of food

C—O
WIRE

and you don’t have to risk getting
in a car after a party.”

B & Emay be gone and with it
a Davidson tradition; but there are
still many other late night options
for students in need of a study
break, bored, wired, wasted or just

hungry.

Planning Aids College Career

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.
| (CPS)—How you prepare for col-
lege before strolling through the
ivy-covered gates and during the
first year is as important to our
future success as the academic
work you do, an administrator
‘says.

“We have found that high
school students who make in-
formed decisions when they
choose a college major are more
likely to persist, succeed, and
graduate from college,” said James
Levin co-author of a study about
how highschool and college coun-
selors can best advise students in
career planning.

The same holds true for first-
year college students who have
undeclared: majors or may be
thinking of switching to a differ-
ent field of study.

Levin, an assistant professor

of education, also helps coordi-
-nate the Division of Undergradu-
ate Studies at Penn State Univer-
sity.
__* “When some students make
these decisions they seem to be-
come more informed on the im-
portance of salary ranges than on
other areas such as matching per-
sonal skills and interests with cer-
tain majors,” Levin said.

The study focused on the
characteristics of 1,044 college
students in orderto determine what
prompted them to persist in their
studies, achieve higher grades and
graduate from college, and which
factors put students at risk.

Students who major in fields
that are believed to pay high sala-
ries, such as engineering, base
their choices of majors solely on

portunities, high salaries, and sta-
tus. However, such motives,
coupled with lack of ability and
real interest in the subject, may
contribute significantly to the at-
trition rate of up to 50 percent for
students who currently pursue en-
gineering degrees, the study said,

Students should choose.a ma-
jor based on their own talents,
interests, and aptitude, the study
recommended. Students should
also be honest about their own
abilities and interests to learn more
about the reality of their chosen
professions before they spend
years studying for a degree that
they can’t or don’t want to use.

“Virtually all students are at
risk if they don’t involve them-
selves in making informed edu-
cational planning decision before
entering college years,” Levin
said. “Any student can become
frustrated or overwhelmed by tak-
ing courses they aren’t interested
or talented in, or don’t have an
aptitude for.”

Anti-Bigotry Conference Held

HANOVER, N.J. (CPS)—
Students, faculty, and staff from
the Ivy League schools gathered
Nov. 7-10 at Dartmouth College
for a conference on how to allevi-
ate bigotry on college campuses.

“We’re looking for a ripple
effect,” said George Demko, di-
rector of Dartmouth’s Nelson A.
Rockefeller Center for Social Sci-
ences, which is hosting the meet-
ing. About 50 students, staff, and
faculty representatives from vari-
ous Ivy League schools attended.

The conference focused on
the roots of bigotry and plans for
combating it on campuses around
the nation.
