gained success and recognition in their re-
spective vocations. They represent the realms
of business, education, manufacturing, in-

surance, ministry, banking, journalism,
medicine and other professions.
Omicron Delta Kappa was founded at

| Washington and Lee University in 1914. It

has a twofold purpose: first. it proposes to

recognize those men, both graduates and un-
dergraduates, who have achieved distinction
{dnd prominence in college life and in the
| world outside, and, secondly, its purpose is
to render service in various ways to the in-
stitutions in which it is located. Character
is a primary prerequisite for membership in
the Omicron Delta Kappa Society. Only
those students are cligible who have gained
distinguished recognition in athletics, schol-
arship, publications, social activities, or stu-
degt body activities. No position automati-
cay rates an Omicron Delta election. Since
its inception membership in this fraternity
has been one of the most coveted honors at-
tainable in those schools where chapters are
located. Many student bodies rank it first
‘among college honors.

The Davidson chapter was installed in 1917
when the society absorbed the old Gryphon

Among the other strong chapters of Omicron |
