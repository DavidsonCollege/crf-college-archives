Part Two: Student Continues Fighting

After Bone Marrow Trans

By DAVID LINDSAY

In the couple of weeks since
the first articleabout my bone mar-
row transplant experience, I have
been both motivated and inspired
to have so many people express
their full support of our cause--the
bone marrow registry drive to be
held this spring. In keeping with
the holiday spirit, our theme is the
“Gift of Life.” I strongly feel that
thisregistry drive offers the chance
of a lifetime--for both you, the
potential donor, and the recipient.

As corny as it may sound,
bone marrow can truly be called,
“the gift that keeps on giving...”
(Believe me, I’m living proof of
this sentiment.) Many people have
expressed their questions on what
exactly is involved for both the
donor and the recipient. If you
choose to take part in our drive this
winter, the Red Cross will draw the
amount of two tablespoons of
blood from your arm, and from
this, your personal H.L.A. type
(Human Leukocyte Antigens) is
determined. These four numbers
are then processed by computer to
see if your genetic tissue type is
compatible with someone in need
of marrow. If your H.L.A. type
ever matches that of someone in
need of marrow, then the opportu-
nity is thereto save a life.

If, indeed, you are “matched”
and are willing to donate a small

Portion. of. your, body’s marrow, , .

: then a simple Procedure, isdone to
remove the needed marrow. Con-

trary to what some might believe,
it’s not like the doctor is removing

a kidney or a lung, or cutting your
bones open and letting the marrow
flow forth; instead, under moder-
ate, or local anesthesia, the mar-
row that is needed can be drawn
through thin needles inserted in
the small of the back.

The only discomfort for the
donor might be a sore back for a
few days following the procedure.

- The donor does not have to stay in

the hospital and they are not in any
risk of complications. Only two to
five percent of the donor’s marrow
is removed, and this amount is
self-replaced by the body’s system
over a few days.

* The commitment we are ask-
ing you to make is not a tremen-
dous time or financial one, but
rather, a commitment from the
heart. It is mind-boggling to per-
ceive how phenomenally miracu-
lous this procedure can be, and the
rewarding feeling you receive will
lastalifetime. This article may not
address all the questions, thus, our

‘committee will be going around to -

eating houses and dorm halls to
talk-to interested persons.

Then, on Thursday, December
6, we will be sponsoring an infor-
mative (hopefully) “Study Break”
to further educate. Now, I’ll try to
relate, in a nutshell, just how the
process works by describing my

- own transplant experience.

At the end of the previous ar-
ticle, I was recalling the events of
past December, 1989, Once it was
realized. that:,my; eight-year old
sister, Lee, was a perfect match, I
underwent a four-week long course
of vigorous chemotherapy. Dur-

ing this mon pia ordeal I re-
ceived numerous intravenous drugs
and vincristine injections four days
a week at the doctor’s office.

Lalso had periodic bone mar-
row aspirations and spinal taps.
(For someone so scared of needles,
I got used to them real fast.) It is
hard to rationally cope with the
fact your body is being torn apart
on the inside by powerful drugs, in
an attempt to heal. I suffered ex-
cruciating muscle pain in my legs
as a side effect of one of the medi-
cations. The pain completely
consumed me to the point I would
practically crawl from room to
room trying to alleviate the dis-
comfort.

Another time, I fainted while
taking a shower due to the cumula-

tive effect of somuch medicine. It.

was emotionally frustrating to see
all the cheery holiday activity and
not being able to fully enjoy it.
However, don’t think for a second
that I’d forgotten that my sister,
Lee, had already given me the best
Christmas gift ever.

In mid-January, my doctor
tested my bone marrow to deter-
mine the effectiveness of all this
chemotherapy. Thankfully, my
marrow was back into a strong
remission. Now, the waiting game
was to begin. Over the next five
weeks, my family nervously
awaited an “opening” on the Bone
Marrow. Unit at the Univ. of Min-
nesota hospital where I was to be

sntreated, During this: waiting pe- -
_riod, I ‘envisioned myself as

“Rocky” heading into the fight of
his life. I prepared my body by

running, jumping rope, lifting
weights, doing push-ups, and eat-
ing well.

I became totally engrossed in
my efforts to steel myself for the
ultimate challenge of a lifetime.
Finally, in early February, we got
the call tocome to Minneapolis for
the preliminary work-up. I re-
member arriving to the snowy.
welcome of the North, unsure of
what lay on the road ahead of me.

For the first week of my stay, I
was poked, pinched, prodded,
examined, studied, and talked to
more than I would have ever imag-
ined. My team of doctors thor-
oughly performed physical after
physical on me. Every inch of my
inside and outside were tested for
anything that might throw a wrench
into the whole transplant process.

My lungs, heart, kidneys, liver,
marrow, spinal fluid, eyes, and
various other organs were exam-
ined to be sure that all were in tip-
top shape. I even had to see a
dentist to have my mouth and teeth
checked. Finally, after all of this
fun, I received the “thumbs-up” to
go forth with the transplant. The
next two months were to be the
trial of a lifetime.

First, they surgically inserteda
flexible catheter from the right
atrium of my heart through two

- rubber tubes that dangled out from

an opening on my Chest. This was
an awkward sensation to say the
least. This was how I received my
drugs. 1 was placed.in“‘protective
isolation” where the transplant
ordeal was to occur. I couldn’t
leave this room, and all who en-

lant From Younger Sister

tered, had to thoroughly wash them-
selves free of germs.

Over an eight-day period, my
entire immune system was de-
stroyed to rid my body of any
unhealthy cells that might lurk in
my marrow. This was done by
submitting my body through twice-
daily “zaps” of total body irradia-
tion. For four days, once in the
morning and once in the evening, I
sat curled up on a bicycle seat in
the midst of these ominous metal
“guns.” . The x-ray technicians
would have to leave the room while
I was radiated, because it was in
such high amounts that, as they put
it, “ it could potentially kill a
“normal” person.

I thought to myself...how
comforting!: After radiation treat-
ment, I had two, 24-hour cycles of
intravenous chemo. Firmly con-
vinced that all the “bad” marrow
was now destroyed, I wasready for
the transplant. On February 28,
my “new birthday,” I received
Lee’s precious marrow throughan
I.V. The actual transplant is fairly
simple; I watched “Family Feud”
and “Geraldo” while being trans-
fused with new life. Three hours
later--it was through. Now, the
true fight began.

We kept a daily watch on my

“counts” to see the white blood

cells reappear. At the same time,

this is when all the horrible pain
andiinfections appeared. I devel-
oped a case of horrendous mouth
sores that covered my lips, mouth,
tongue, and throat. The pain was

ROTC Finishes
Fourth At Competition

By: TED RACH ARRSON

On October 27 the Ranger Chal-
lenge team competed in the “Bri-
- gade Shootout” at Ft. Jackson
which brought together all ROTC
host schools in North and South
Carolina. Davidson finished fourth
out of twenty-three teams. Team
captain Mike Peters and senior

team member Derrick Willardboth °

commented on the strength of the
teams they faced at Ft. Jackson.
Willard said, “It was by far the
~ strongest competition. ever.
Davidson really held their own.”
Peters added, “We really opened
some eyes being one of the small-
estROTC departmentsrepresented
and still doing so well.”
Davidson Ranger Challenge
did perform well, defeating formi-
dable teams such as Clemson,

Duke, Eastern Carolina, and South .

Carolina, The few teams they lost
to were from unusually large pro-
~ grams like NCSU or from military
schools like the Citadel.

Ranger Challenge competitions.

and a 10K Road Run. The Road
Run, being the final event of the

day, is perhaps the most crucial
and the most painful. Each mem-
ber of the nine-person team must
cross the finish line together after
traversing the 6.2 mile course car-
rying a 35 Ib. ruck sack, an M-16
rifle, and wearing heavy combat
boots. Peters commented on this
year’s run Saying, “Five teams
could have won going into the Road

had an excellent chance of win-

mass start of the race, which Peters

said was more like “mass confu-
sion,” didn’t phase this year’s team

Religion professor David
Kaylorand History professor Ralph
Levering led discussions on the

. Various dimensions of the United

States’ relation to the Middle East
while Colonel John Moncure of
Davidson’s ROTC program-ad-
dressed the military’s perspective
of the Middle East crisis.

Mary Anna Bode, acitizen of
Davidson, spent a large portion of
her life in the Middle East and was
also available for questions con-
cerning the cultural aspects of the
entire Middle East area.

Homsby acknowledged that
therally was agreatsuccess, buthe
emphasized that the rally was not

‘simply an anti-war rally.

“Tt wasn’t really wasn’t sup-
posed to be an anti-war rally,” said
Hornsby, “but we wanted people
to realize exactly what was going
on over there.”

Balanced with the background

guitar of Davidson’s John Morris
and Kurt Perkins, the rally was
designed to “educate people on the
serious aspects of the situation.”

Graver anticipated that due to
the recent ultimatum placed on
Hussein by the U.N. that the exis-
tence of future rallies is imminent.

If the situation continues to de-
teriorate, Graver sees the congre-
gating of people opposed to waras
necessary to form a voice against
Bush’s present policy.

According to Graver, “there is
aneed.” ~

Oil War
Conituued from Page 1

the drums for war are very irre-
sponsible. People who say it’s

going to be a walk-over, a piece of

cake, are irresponsible. It’s not
going to be easy. From the military
we are hearing the voice of sweet
reason, saying wait, let’s not be so
eager to goto war. It’s an interest-
ing shift of roles.”

Summers concedes that oil was

Army Lt. Col. John Moncure
of Davidson ROTC said he was
delighted with Summers's remarks.
He agrees that fuel is playing a
leading role in decision-making.
““We’re there to provide a free flow
of oil, but this is an opportunity to
establish a world voice, saying that
we will not tolerate aggression.”

The lecture sparked contrast-
ing views among students. __

“It gave mea much better feel-
ing about what’s going on,” said
senior Mike Peters, whohas trained

Moncure~ reported: that

ger may soon be en route there.
Another student was upset by
Summers’s talk. “He is taking the
situation from the vantage point

‘that war is an option," said sopho-

more Jonathon Harris, "and I’m
too idealistic to give into that.”
Summers shared his hopes that

peace will come about. “We are
still seeking a peaceful solution,”
he said, “and with any luck we will
bring one on.”
