Nordeen Speaks To Alumni
On College Life Income Plan

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

After two weeks as David
son’s Director of Deferred Giv
ing, Ronaid D. Nordeen, is be-
ginning to study North Carolina
tax laws and to set up an itin-
erary to speak to alumni
groups.

Nordeen admitted that the
deferred giving business is a
complex area, but the basic
concept is the giving of a sum
of money to the college which
holds the funds in trust while
returning the earnings of the
principal to the donor during
his lifetime. When the donor
dies the college places the prin-
cipal of the gift in the endow-
ment fund of the college.

There are several

Cornell Consolidates Area
Of Development Priorities

However, C. David Cornell,
Vice-President of Finance and
Development, was able to con-
solidate the complex program
into two easily distinguishable
areas, ‘‘friend-raising and fund-
raising.”

Under the area of ‘‘friend
raising” comes Davidson’s pub-
lic information § service, the
News Bureau and the Alumni
Office as well as the Sports In-
formation Department, all of
which are dgsigned to keep the
general ublic, along with
friends and alumni, interested
and aware of important evgsts
concerning the college.

Thus without the primary
process of “friend raising,” the
all important “fund raising”
would be an even more diffi-
cult job, if not an impossible
task. |

The basic need for raising
funds is simply to cover the
costs for the education of every
student. Each year tuition and
fees cover only fifty per cent
of the cost. The difference must
be raised in various different
ways.

A great portion of the college
income comes from dividends
received from the college en-
dowment, which now has a mar-
ket value of about $18 million.

These funds, from which the
college takés five per cgnt of
@he market value for its oper-
ating expenses, have been in-
creased through the years by
large gifts from individuals,
foundations, and corporations.

Money from the Duke En-
dowment Fund also falls into

this category ®ad annually sup-
plies the college with an a-
mcunt equivalent to the inter-
est on almost $15 million.

Yearly budget expenses not
covered by the endowment
must be met by the annual
fund. In order to balance col
hse expenses by using this in-
it is necessary to collect
the amount of money in the an-
nual fund through alumni foun-
dations, corporation gifts and
unrestricted — gifts.

The goal for this year’s fund
is $310,000, an increase of fifty
per cent over last year’s fig-
ure. The raising of the annual
fund at many colleges is great-
ly simplified because as many
as sixty per cent of the alumni
donate money to it on a yearly
basis.

Director of Development Don-
ald L. Winston pointed out that
only twenty-five per cent of the
Davidson alumni donate mon-
ey, however. This is one rea-
son that the school is planning
and sponsoring numerous alum-
ni events including reunions,
special weekends, and speakers
for their clubs.

A third element of income to
the school comes under the cap-
ital gift campaigns. These funds
are outside of the yearly budg-
et and come solely from don-
ations. Cornell stressed that
three main projects are now
being emphasized.

Of primary importance is the
library for which $2 million has

thus far been raised. Plans for
this have been completed and
hopefully construction will be-
gin in the near future. The li-
brary will be located where
the College Union now stands.

Secondly, money from the
capital gifts will be used to
cover academic scholarships.
Also the need for the upgrad-
ing of existing endowed chairs
and the establishment of new
ones can hopefully be met.

A chain donation involves
enouh endowment to cover and/
or supplement a professor’s sal-
ary each year through invest-
ment interest dividends.

The development staff is also
working with Queens College
officials to plan a joint cam-
paign to begin in 1972. The
financial campaign will be sup-
ported by ithe Presbyterian Sy-
nod of North Carolina.

Two final sources of income
are the Wildcat Fund, which
helps the school supplement the
cost of the football scholarship
program, and the Deferred Giv-
ing Program.

The latter seeks two major
kinds of gifts. First are be-
quests received through a don-
or’s will. Secondly, a donor can
establish a trust fund at the
college and receive the income
from those funds during his
lifetime. Upon his death, these
funds would be added to the
college’s endowment.

der the category of life income
plans. The first is the gift an-
nuity which provides a guar-
anteed, set rate of lifetime in-
come on a gift of cash or other
property to Davidson College.
This plan has several tax ad-
vantages.

The second of tthe life income
plans is the trust. The donor
makes a gift of appreciated as-
sets and describes what type
of income return he desires on
the property until his death.
He may prefer a large return
interest in later years and can
so stipulate.

The third plan is the pooled
income fund. In this case the
donor pools his funds with other
donors and the rate of return
is based on the combined in-
come of the pooled funds. This
pian has many tax advantages
and is popular at several col-
leges across the country, Nor-
deen said.

Nordeen has many plans for
deferred giving. He expects to
make the availability of this

program known through letters,
of advertisement, alumni pub-*

lications and personal contact
in his travels. He emphasized
the value of . direct contact
when discussing deferred giv-
ing with possible donors.

A steady enrichment of the
college endowment from defer-
red giving will require several
years to be realized, he said.

During the past five years,
Nordeen worked on the devel-
opment staff of Pomona Col-

lege and was responsible for
writing over $10 million in an-
nuity and life income contracts.

Regulations Sef
For Refrigerators

In a decision late in June,
The Residential Hall Council
(RHC) passed by unanimous
vote a resolution revising the
regulations concerning the use
of refrigerators on residence
halls.

The new ruling states that
all refrigerators must be regis-
tered with the R.H.C. within
three weeks after the begin-
ning of the 1971 Fall Term, in
the name of one individual who
will assume responsibility for
any water damage, etc. incur-
red from refrigerator usage.

The registrant in question
will be responsible for the re-
molval of his refrigerator over
the summer term from. the
premises of Davidson College,
and for defrosting, cleaning,
and disconnecting his refriger-
ator before each term break.

The recommended size of
such refrigerators was set by
the council to include, but not
exceed six cubic feet with ex-
ceptions permitted only upon
inspection by the R.H.C., the
intent being to rule out .possi-
ble fire hazards.

All units found to have faulty
wiring must be disposed of
withing one week of inspection.
