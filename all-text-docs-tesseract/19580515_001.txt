The choice of President Martin was the culmination of nearly fifteen months of deliberation by a five-
man Trustees’ committee appointed to-choose .a new president shortly after President Emeritus John R. Cun-

An Editorial

The DAVIDSONIAN congratulates the Board of
Trustees on its choice of D. Grier Martin as the next
President of Davidson College.

Mr. Martin has proved during the past six years,
and especially this year, that he has the ability, -in-
telligence, and affinity for forceful action that will
be néeded during the coming years, if Davidson is to
realize its real potential.

In many ways, Mr. Martin may be considered a
unique choice to foliow in the footsteps of John Rood
Curiningham. He is no minister, and has no impressive
string of academic degrees. Perhaps to some. this
will make a difference, but not to anyone who has
known and worked with the new President. Ability
has a way of making itself evident. either with or
without titles.

The man who will sit behind the largest. desk in
Chambers Building for the years to come will. have
a job to match the size of the furniture.

A crucial time is upon Davidson. The era of
transition has begun. Of this there can be no doubt
The only question that remains concerns the future
path which the College will follow. The path to na-
tional eminence and Southern predominence in the
field of liberal arts education lies open, perhaps as
open as it has ever been. The decision now lies largely
in the hands of D. Grier Martin. The DAVIDSONIAN
trusts that he will not long hesitate in his choice.

Mr. Martin will. face one disadvantage in assuming
his new office. He knows too many people here at
Davidson. When the inevitable pushes and pulls come
between his administration and the faculty or Board.
of Trustees, we urge him to stand his ground, despite
past associations, and to step on a few time honored
toes, if necessary. to implement his program for the
College.

Again, the DAVIDSONIAN congratulates Mr. Mar-
tin on his success and wishes for him the best of for-
tune in his new venture.

The four leaf clover was found in the campus
grass.

R. LaFar. chairman. Mr. J. Spencer Love, Dr. James P.
