On Danger Of Water Beds

By JOHN KEPCHAR
Staff Writer

For those students who can't
keep from tossing and turning
all night unless they are sleep.
ing on their water bed, struc-
tural weaknesses in the dormi-
tories may prevent their sound
sleep.

“No further water beds will be
allowed on campus until a spe-
cial study has been completed.”
said Mrs. Scotty Nicholls, Di-

Evans To Deliver
Reynolds Lectures

Clifford Evans. airman of
the department of anthropo-
logy of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, will deliver a series of
Reynolds Leciures here Tues-
day through Thursday, Oct. 5-7.

One of the nation's leading
anthropologists and the author
of more than 100 professional
articles on ancient civilizations
in South America, Evans will
speak on:

“Why Do We Study the Past
and What Relevance is Arch-
eclogy to the Modern World?”
at 10 a.m. Tuesday in Per-
kins Auditorium:

“Transpacific Contact at 3000
B. C.,"° 8 p.m. Tuesday, Hod-
son Hall;

“The Mystery of the Ruins of -
Nan Madol, Ponape, Caroline

Islands, Micronesia.” 10 a.m.

recior of Studem Housing.

Students presently using wa-
ter beds on campus may con-
tinue to use them until a final
decision has been reached after
the study results are in.

“The answer will come in a
few weeks.” said Mr. Grover
Meetz. Director of the Physical
Plant. “A committee will in-
vestigate the effects of the add-
ed weight on the dormitories,
and also consider the results of
a possible leak.’ Metz said.

Many people have pointed out -

that things could be rather mis-
erable with more than 300 gal-
lons of water dripping through
the ceiling.

The committee will probably
be cu:rnposed of Meetz. Nicholls,
and Dean of Students Will HI.
Terry. Metz said.

_ Changes

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

The Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid has compiled
some preliminary statistics on
the Class of 1975.

College board scores are down
from last year’s freshman class.
The Class of 1974 had an aver-
age verbal score of 600 as op-
posed to this year’s average of
593. The average math score
for lasi year's freshman class
was 644 and this vear it is 639.

The Class of 1974 had com-
bined college board scores of

1244, which gave it the highest -

average college board scores in
the history of Davidson.

By another criterion this
year's freshman class did as
well as last year’s. The per-
centage of those ranking in the
top fifth of their class for both
classes is 86.. Director of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid H.
Edmunds White commented.
“The 86° figure for this year's
freshman class ‘is a shade more
impressive than las: year's be-
cause of the increase in the en-
rollment of private school grad-
uates.”” These graduates tend to
come from schools more com-
petitive than public ones.

The number of private school
educated freshmen increased
dramatically over last year.
Fifty-three are in the Class of
1975, and their percentage is
17%. as opposed to 8°. last year,
which had been the recent trend.

Members of the Office of Ad-
missions will be visiting addi-
tional private secondary schools
this year. White said, "We will
probably see an increasing num-
ber of students entering David-
son from private schools. Those
parents who have sent their sons
to private sécondary schools are
more likely to send them to
private colleges such as David-
son.”

Those scoring a 3. 4, or 5 on
the Advanced Placement Ex-
aminations showed an increase
in this vear's freshman class.
In the Class of 1975 sixty-eight
did this as compared to sixty-
five in the Class of 1974. This
probably reflects the increased
number of preparatory school
students, aS private schools tend
to emphasize the Advanced

Freshman Statistics Reflect

In Admissions

Placement Exams more than

public schools.

Ten percent of those accepted
for the Class of 1975 and need-
ing financial assistance did not
receive financial aid equal to
need. In the future those receiv-
ing financial aid will have to
rely on substantial self-help in
the form of jobs and loans.

“We were unable to supply
aid equal to need to all mem-
bers of this year’s freshman
class. and those who decided
to come despite this fact had
to rely entirely on self-help,”
said White.

Private institutions such as
Davidson are iending more to
attract students from the high-
er and lower income brackets.
With rising costs and present
financial aid policies, the mid-
dle ciz.ss is finding it more and
more difficult to afford a pri-
vate college education.

As in the past, the great ma-
jority of freshmen tend to come
from North Carolina, South
Carolina. Georgia, Virginia, and
Florida.

This trend will prob-

ably centinue, although certain
sections of the country will re-
ceive new emphasis by the Of-
fice of Admissions. For exam-
ple. the time spent by a repre-
sentative of the Office of Ad.
missions in New York City will
double this year.

Davidson has instituted a new
policy in regard to athletic
grants. When a student volunt-
arily ceases to participate in a
sport for which he recevied a
scholarship, Davidson will have
the authority to reduce or eli-
minate his scholarship.

For 1971-72 the amount need-
ed to finance the football schol-
arship program is about $170,-
000. Also, Davidson is commit-
ted to maintaining a superior
basketball program, and this is
reflected in the fact that the
most number of scholarships
Coach Driesell had was sixteen.
However. Coach Holland now
has eighteen. According to the
college. more money is being
expended for basketball than at
any other time.
