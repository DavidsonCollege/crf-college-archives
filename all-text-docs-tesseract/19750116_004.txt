Overworked Meetze Spread Too Thin

By MARK WILENSKY
Managing Editor

Behind the doors of the
Physical Plant Office is an
overworked, overextended
staff. They complain regularly
of too heavy a work load and too
lean a budget.

The staff is headed by Grover
C. Meetze Jr. Meetze is a multi-
talented man, with expertise in
areas such as_ acoustics;
building design and college
security.

Former Vice-President for
Finance and Development C.
David Cornell often remarked,
“We have an easier job building
than do most colleges. We have
aman like Meetze.

““Meetze can draw plans, do
inspections and generally save
us large amounts of money,”
Cornell added.

While Meetze contirues to
prove his worth each day, the
compulsion of Davidson’s ad-
ministration to use his talents to
save the college money may be
costing dearly. His budget has
been slashed during the last
years, while the responsibilities
of his office have been in-
creased.

Meetze has drawn the plans
for Grey Union. Having drawn
them, he has had to see them
continually changed, discarded
and thrown away by Davidson
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. and Union Director
C. Shaw Smith.

Meetze claims to have lost
count as to how many times he
has re-drawn the plans.

The job Meetze is handling is
one usually consigned to a full-
time architect. As Cornell said,
‘““Meetze saves Davidson the
cost of hiring an architect.”’
is the

Meanwhile, there

problem of maintainence of the _

physical plant itself.

At the present time, Meetze
heads up college security. His
staff cleans the dorms, repairs
buildings, tends to the grounds,
builds fences at the president’s
house, repairs college-owned
non-campus property, fixes
electrical and wiring problems
and coordinates all energy con-

servation efforts.

The work ‘ranges from
problems as simple as spraying
for ants’ to complying with
federal building regulations.
Many students claim that the
Physical Plant Office is not
doing its job. Many faculty and
administration‘sources claim it
cannot do its job. aa

Work orders submitted to the
Physical Plant Office routinely
form backlogs. Finding the
overworked Phil Cashion or Ir-
vin Brawley is a task often im-
possible even for Staff

Secretary Mary Parks Knox:
Meetze himself is on the town
council and works with the
Davidson Community Proper-
ties Corporation.

While Meetze _ routinely

redesigns light fixtures for the
new union, heaters fail to work
in Watts and Little. While Meet-
ze is consulted as to whether to
put grass or brick in Richar-
dson Plaza, the basement of
Belk floods.

At last look, the college, due
to mechanical malfunctions,
was dumping raw sewage into
the laundry creek, polluting the
Rocky River and creating what
Professor of Biology David C.
Grant calls ‘‘a health menace.”

Due to malfunctioning of the college pumping system, raw sewage
is being spilled into the laundry creek, moving directly into the

Rocky River.

Take No Chances

“Corporate money has gotten
tighter, but I am optimistic,”
added Williams.

Burnett also expressed op-
timism about fund raising for a
renovated facility.

“I feel that we have a great
sales pitch in applying for
money. The chemistry depart-
ment and pre-meds form the

largest group on campus.
“Medical students. are
required to take more

chemistry courses than any
other field of study. Davidson
has built much of its reputation
on the medical people who have
graduated from here,’’ stated
Burnett.

“I know a foundation which
might give us $100,000, if we ap-
proach them with these types of
arguments.

“Provided the administration
makes a commitment toward
constructing a new chemistry
building or renovating the
present Martin building, Spen-
cer would need to grant faculty
release time to a chemistry

last week and a half of Christ-
mas break.

Normal dorm repair requests
are delayed or lost in the mass

of work.

The fault is easily placed with
college claims the need to lock
Chambers while heating the
empty dormitories during the
the Physical Plant Office. As
director, Meetze takes the
abuse when toilets do not flush
while four men spend the pre-
Thanksgiving week and most of
the vacation building a fence
beside the president’s house.

If the health department fines
or cites Davidson College as
Grant claims they would if they
knew the college was dumping

raw sewage into the laun
créek, Meetze will be blamed. -

If the Occupational and
Safety Health Administration
discovers the violations in the
campus buildings, again Meet-
ze’s department will look bad.

However, Meetze is unable to
prevent any of these disasters.
The work expected of this man
is that usually done by an entire
staff. And many of his priority
decisions are directives from
higher ups.

Nonetheless, mildew is on the
shower curtains, OSHA and the
Board-of Health loom, and the
new rooms in Belk flood during
heavy rains. Davidson, the elm
trees are rotting.

With last Friday’’s torrential rains, came a monumental flood. The
new rooms in Belk Dormitory were ankle-deep in water.

professor to enable us to work
out a total room by room
analysis, to visit other schools,
and note innovations,’ added
Burnett.

“T recommend the decision to
renovate the Martin building.
This is the most economical ap-
proach,’ said Burnett.

Burnett felt that present
classes using the facility could
be relocated during ‘a reno-
vation period.

“If we were to renovate, the
chemistry department could
rearrange its lab schedule so as
to make the chemistry ‘building
free for six months. There is
room in Chambers, so that we
could hold classes there during
the renovation period.

“If the money for renovation
or building becomes available,
we will arrange our schedule so
as to get out of the builder’s
way,’ commented Burnett.

‘Renovation will cost ap-
proximately $900,000. A. new
chemistry building comparable
in size to the present Martin
building would cost about $2

million.
“The addition of a new
building would - increase

operating costs, and would
change the college cash flow
situation. On the other hand, if a
new building was constructed
the present Martin building
would be freed for other pur-
poses,”

According to Meetze, ‘The
Martin building is structurally
sound and interior walls could
be removed with minimal ex-
pense.’”’ Burnett indicated that
the new chemistry renovation
would need to contain a
chemical storage bunker,
adequate ventilation systems,
more efficient use of space,
classrooms with acoustical
ceilings, temperature and
humidity controlled instrument
rooms, and_ self-instructional
rooms.

The attic of .the Martin
building might also be opened.

Burnett ‘stated that the in-
corporation of these modi-
fications into a renovated buil-
ding would comply with
federal safety laws.
