ew Baker gym ready for construction

By JOHN BAKROW

At its March meeting, the
_ Davidson Board of Trustees an-
nounced the receipt of a 3.5 mil-
lion dollar pledge from John D.
Baker Jr. ’25 and his brother
Thompson S. Baker ’26 for the
construction of a new sports facili-
ty. The new building will be
named in honor of the Bakers.

According to Dean Jones, As-
sistant Director of Development,
the announcement of the donation
culminated several months of
work between college officials
and the donors. “These things
don’t happen overnight. It re-
quires a lot of hard work on the
part of many people to bring about
a gift of this size.”

The Baker gift raises to 10
million dollars the amount made
in pledges toward construction of
the planned 14 million dollar com-
plex. An additional 3 million dol-
lars will-be needed to endow the
Maintenance of the building.

Construction of the new build-
ing will probably begin in the
summer of 1987 and should be

completed by late fall of 1988. |

association’s (SGA’s) next presi-
dent, and sophomore Lee Nagen-
dran was voted its vice president
in elections held earlier this week.
Doenges, who defeated junior Jay
Hurt and sophomore Chafles Brat-
ton in the election, says it is his
main goal to expand the role of the
SGA from its current role primar-
ily consisting of student services
to a wider scope of activities.

“When you talk about goals,
first you have to look at the struc-
ture of the SGA. It’s really ser-
vice-oriented in that first of all we
produce services for students such
as phonathon, SGA weekend, the
career symposium and the rides
board. We need to continue that
role, but we shouldn’t be exclu-
sively a ‘service organization,”
Doenges said.

“135 ,000 square foot structure

would be the biggest construction
project ever undertaken by the
college. (Currently, E.H. Little
Library with approximately
100,000 sq. ft. is the largest build-
ing on campus).

In addition to the construction
of the sports complex, new prac-
tice fields, parking areas and pos-
sibly a new entrance to the college
campus off Concord Rd. will be
built. Director of Facilities Plan-
ning Grover Meetze noted that the
“new facility will move us into a

very favorable position with other .

schools that have the same goals
and aspirations that we do.” —
Meetze said that the “facility
is planned for students.” In addi-
tion to the already completed
Knobloch Tennis Center, the
Baker Sports Complex will in-
clude 7 raquetball courts, 1 squash
court, a natatorium with 8 lane

pool and diving facilities, a 6,000:

seat basketball arena, an indoor
track, and a new weight room, as
well as locker rooms, offices, and
training rooms. Glass panels will
allow spectators to view activities
in all areas of the complex from
the student entrance.

sophomores David Petranick and
Reese Boyd to win the vice presi-
dent’s position, says her main
goal is to expand the role commit-
tees play in the workings of the
SGA. She said the main duty of
the vice president is to work with
committees.

I think most of the committees
are centered around.a_ certain
event. The committees did a won-
derful job in capitalizing on the
big events, but after that the scope
shrinks down. I hope we can keep
that scope open all year long.
There’s a lot of work beforehand,
but I’d like to ‘see the scope
broadened so that committees
aren’t limited to a single event. It
should be a year long commitment
that makes people feel more in-
volved. That’s .what’s most im-
portant about being on a commit-
tee, and that’s an important part of
the SGA,” Nagendran said.

another hardwood basketball

used for intra-murals.

_ Besides providing better facil-
ities for student use, Director of
Athletics Kit Morris sees the new

agree that the SGA could expand
on its ability to communicate with
students in general. Doenges said

‘communication with. the student

body could work to prevent stu-
dent apathy. “The SGA should
represent the students’ views. In
that area, I think Mark Sandy (last
SGA president) has made great
progress. He changed representa-
tion from dorm senators to Patter-
son Court __ representatives.
Through this link, communication
between the student body and the
SGA needs to be strengthened. In
a major effort, this could work to
get rid of student apathy. I was
disgusted to see only 85. seniors
show up for the Sesquicentennial
Convocation. I think student in-
volvement is at a serious low, and
I think with communication we

-can help solve the problem,”

Doenges said.
Nagendran said the SGA is
open to ideas from the student

building as a means of broadening
Davidson’s varsity athletics pro-
gram. “The new facility will elim-
inate the floor conflict question,
‘giving us the potential to recon-
sider women’s basketball. We
will also be able to consider a
men’s and women’s swimming

body and looks to the student body
for resources with which to work.
She agreed with Doenges that stu-
dent apathy is a serious problem.
“A lot of students are not, or
think that they can’t get, involved
or that there’s not much they can
do. SGA can change that. Being
on a committee is great for that,”
Nagendran said.
_ Doenges and Nagendran both
mentioned the possiblity of
Davidson’s switching from its

current trimester system to a

semester system as a major issue

facing the SGA. Doenges sees the

role of the SGA in the semester
debate as an informative one.
“The chief role of the SGA
would be to inform the student
body of the advantages and disad-
vantages of semesters and trimes-
ters. I think most students base

- their decisions on an impulsive re-

sponse, but if you find out why
they would be making changes,

the athletic department staff might
be enlarged to include a strength
coach, aquatics director, and life
guards. |

a decision, but only when they are
informed should the SGA have a
referendum to hand to the trustees
and administration,” Doenges
said.

Nagendran says she supports
the idea of a 4-1-4 system in which
the calendar would include two
semesters and an independent
month-long term in January. That
system, she said, would provide
for greater flexibility.

“Our terms just dont ‘jive’
with anyone else’s. The one
month in Janurary would give
people a lot of flexibility to go

- abroad, and people could get in-

ternships in Charlotte. The four
month long semesters would give
flexibility to go with other
school’s programs, but I don’t
think it will happen before 1990,”
Nagendran said. ©
