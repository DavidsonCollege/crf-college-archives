Seasoned Greetings

Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus. He's a fat red plastic bubble
with a white painted-on beard and a
hollow heart. He is worshiped by
thousands of merchants and millions
of givers and receivers and exchang-
ers.

He spreads millions of dollars
worth of joy and_ sentimentality.
though he doesn’t spread it very
evenly. Thousands of charities and
gift funds try to take advantage of the
temporary softness of his normally
hardened followers. _

Hundreds and hundreds of or-
giastic rites are held in his honor
every winter—in houses, in. church
basements, in country clubs, and even
in college unions. You can smell his
spirit on the breath of his followers
and see the stains his soilled libations
made on many floors.

Frenzied musicians and wild danc-
ers perform in his name, and glitter-
ing gaudy symbols of his power are
lavishly strung throughout the streets
and buildings, including tall trees
and holly wreaths. He is reincarnated
a thousand times simultaneously in

every department store, television
station, and church parlor.

He is a great spirit who tries to
blow away every frown or serious
thought for many days, who pene-
trates every household, and deceives
every child into obedience. He blows
once a year in a raging storm of
spending and celebrations, then rests
until the next Thanksgiving in moldy
boxes and Christmas Savings Plans.

Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus. You see him on every street
corner futilly ringing his little bell
for the passers-by. You see him lifting
unsuspecting children onto his knee
and convincing them that they want a
white elephant for Christmas. You see
him on the TV selling watches and
aspirin and dancing with his erotic
female helpers. °

. But, Virginia, don’t confuse Santa
Claus with Saint Nicholas, and don’t
let them tell you he gave the Virgin
Mary a baby for Christmas. Listen,
listen in silence beyond the laughing,
screaming Bacchanals, listen. Listen
for a still small voice.

Football On The Line

Davidson's football program is,
and probably will remain, its most
perplexing problem. No one is par-
ticularly satisfied with the situation,
yet no one can seem to come up with
a solution to it. How are these for
incongruities?

1. The over-all scholasuc aver-
age of our football team is consistent-
ly higher than the student body aver-
age. However, the scholastic demands
and entrance requirements of the
school are a major obstacle to our re-
cruiting program.

2. We are able to give 42 full
football scholarships next year,—an
increase of four over this year—which
means that over two thirds of our
players will receive some assistance.
However, we are still in the cellar of
the Southern Conference with respect
to number of football. scholarships
given. In fact, we are 16 below the
next lowest school, William and Mary.

3. With the exception of scholar-
ships, the over-all program (includes
recruiting, equipment, transportation,

etc.) suffers generally from a lack of
funds. However, gate receipts this
year—admittedly a bad year for the
team—left the program approximate-
ly $10,000 in the black.

4. No one is arguing that David-
son maintains its football program
merely to give the boys a chance to
play the game. A sport which, along
with basketball, consumes 34% of
the living endowment begins to look
a trifle expensive under such an argu-
ment. Yet few would like to see Dav-
idson give up football, or even see the
team pulled out of a conference in
which it ought to be able to hold its
own.

On top of all this, students and
alumni continually cry, with some
justification, for a strong team (i.e. a
winning season). After all. if David-
son must field a team, it might as well
be the best (isn’t everything else?).

Frankly we don’t know the an-
swer to the problem; no one does.
However, it does appear that David-
son’s entire attitude towards football
needs to be re-evaluated.

The Fall-Out Follies

“These are the times that try men’s
souls.” This is, of course, a quote from
one of those forefathers we like to
emulate so much. Yet we wonder how
these founding fathers would look on
the American public’s tendency to
“go underground” every time. a crisis
breaks out.

We can't help thinking that they
would disapprove of an American
public that frantically builds more
shelters rather than calling for a cessa-
tion of nuclear testing. But at least
Davidson’s current activities show
that we are in the mainstream of pub-
lic action (or reaction).

Yes, we, with other schools, have
decided that it’s time we were prepar-
ed for the worst (This is not to be con-
fused with Armageddon). Salem Col-
lege has discovered that their Morav-
ian fathers had enough foresignt to
build structures that far exceed gov-
ernment specifications for shelters.
In fact they’ve got the best facilities in
town (residents of Winston-Salem take
note). Catawba College not only has
Shelters but it’s giving first aid
courses. Vanderbilt University stud-

ents have discovered that one of their
shelters is used to store garbage in
peacetime. And we've got the halls of
Chambers. . .

But, believe it or not, we have
done the other schools one better in
this realm. Our shelters are not only
fall-out shelters but, according to the
latest Davidson College Bulletin, they
are bona-fide bomb shelters! This
should be a real boon for prestige. In
fact it makes us sound pretty darned
strategic! What with 13 Rhodes Schol-
ars, the new computer and all...

Anyway, now that we're IN, we

too will be able to join that national

asttime called hide-and-go-seek. And
ere are the rules:

(1) You create a crisis;

(2) Everyone must run to their
Shelters and hide their eyes;

(3) You wait for the countdown
to end (We let Sam do that.);

(4) Then you come out to see if
there’s anyone left.

(5) Then you can start all over.

The Kids And The Party: 2 7 The Word =.
Barium Springs Sketch

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Seventy-five to one hundred

years ago, Barium Springs was
a health resort where people
came for rest and a drink of
barium water to restore their
physical vigor. Today, Barium
Springs no longer features the
water from the spring but is
rather a service of healing for
boys and girls under the care
of the Presbyterian Church. The
present superintendent is a
Davidson alumnus, Rev. Albert
McClure, ‘31.

In its beginning, the Home
had less than 25 children. At
its maximum — enroliment,
more than # quarter of a cen-
tury ago, there were 365 on
campus in an unbelievably
crowded condition. Present
working capacity for the
Home is 225 boys and girls.
Ordinarily, 12 - 16 children,
ranging in age from six to 18
or 19, live in one building.
Residence in the Home varies

according to the needs of the
child. He may be at Barium for
one or two years, or it may be
necessary for him to stay until
he is graduated from high
school. An earnest effort is
made to keep in close touch
with the family and, if the way
be clear, to return the child to
his own community at the
earliest possible date. In the
event that this is not possible,
he may continue at Barium
Springs until he has finished
high school.

The Home considers the
graduates to be children of
the church and mekes pro-
visions for them to receive
further education or training
or essists in securing employ-
ment for those who want
work. This is finenced through
the educational fund which is
being supported by the me
moriel gifts—memorial gifts
made in the past and those
continuing to be made through
the memorial fund.

‘There are at present two
dozen Barium alumni in 14 col-
leges, as ‘well as numerous
others in vocational schools. As

is true generally, many of the
high school boys and girls have
married after gracuation and
have begun their own homes.
Barium graduates are found in

the ranks of nearly all the pro- -

fessions. The roster shows that
men and women are ministers,
teachers, psychiatrists, dentists,
coaches, carpenters, plumbers,
bank presidents, lawyers, army
officers, postmasters, nurses,
morticians, and others.

There is a great variety of
activity on the campus thet
requires 50 to 60 adults. In
addition, every child in the
Home has a job equal to his
age and ability. The girls
serve in the dining room, help
prepare meals, work in the
laundry, in the sewing room,
tn the infirmary, and in the
office. The boys are assigned
to the dairy, to the 40 acre
orchard, to the 500 acre farm,
to the maintenance of the
35-aere campus, to the shop
crew for painting and repair-
ing buildings, and to the gar:
dens.

As far as institutional work
and its place in the total picture
of child care, it is commonly
agreed that there is a threefold
function in child care. Children
are provided for through adop-
tions, through foster homes, and
institutional care, the latter of
which Barium Springs is one of
the finest examples. In North
Carolina, there is fine coopera-
tive effort on the part of the
denominational, fraternal and
state agencies in rendering
services to the children of this
state.

For nearly 20 years, part of
Davidson's relationship with
Barium Springs has been the
annual Christmas parties around
the fraternity court. With these
parties soon coming up for near-
ly 100 children from grades one
through eight, it would be well
for all Davidsonians to bear in
mind the comment of Reverend
McClure, “If the children had to
make a choice between Davidson
and Heaven, it would be a most
difficult choice indeed.”

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Complete Individualism
Not Key To Progress

Dear Editor:

While reading the editorial
page of last week’s DAVIDSON-
IAN, an article with the heading
“Love of Organization Reveals
Fear of Self” caught. my eye.
The. first time I read it, only
minor pangs of disgust welled
up inside of me; but after read-
ing and rereading it, I became

Stowell Outlines Vagabonds Purpose:
To Share Ideas Through Dramatics

BY DON STOWELL
Assistant Director of Dramatics

_Anyone reading last week's
lead editorial. “An Evening in
the Village.” by Bill Ruth was
undoubtedly confused as to ist
what the Vagahonds have been
doing or why we have bsthered
doing anything. I am still not
sure exactly what he was savin«
but I would appreciate the ov-
portunity to comment on sev-
eral matters he brought up.

First of all, the words “vaga-
bonds” and “ghetto” do not
fit well together. A vagabond
is a rover, a travelling player,
while a ghetto Is a quarter in-
habited chiefly by Jews. If
Mr. Ruth was implying thet

Cave Counterpoint was in-
habited chiefly by Vagabonds,
let me dispel that idea. | do
not recall seeing half of the
Varieties audience in the Fine
Arts Building except on the

rarest occasions. Furthermore,
the Vagabonds is composed of

a great variety of people with

very diverse opinions and
ways of working, held togeth-

er by factors brought out fur-
ther along in this article.

Second, the point of the Vaga-
bond Varieties was to provide
an outlet for anyone who want-
ed to do anything, not to
“achieve the libertv” we crave.
In an informal situation such
as the Cave, the limitations of
a prepared script and setting
are not in evidence. as in a play,
so I suppose we had a certain
liberty. At the same time there
was more of a duty to keep the
evening interesting and infor-
mal, and that takes more work
than may be obvious. The pro-
fram was loose and varied.
Nothing was censored. a fact
that somewhat bothered some of
the participants. But, at the
same time, no one was forced
to read or play or sing anything
he didn't want to. Since the
Varieties was primarily a show
put on by students, any “liber-
ty” was something desired by
the students involved.

The statement that the “Vaga-
bond Ghetto . . . attempts to
impose upon the Establishment
the same liberty by force,” is
perhaps the greatest evidence of
muzziness (mental fuzziness) in
the editorial. It should be quite
obvious that the Vagabonds do
not force either participation in
events or attendance at them.
Tf this were the case, the cast
and crew of GALILEO would
not have been embarrased at

the curtain calls opening night
as they looked into the empti-
ness of Hodson Hall and into
the faces of perhaps 25 people—
fewer than the cast assembled
on the stage. If force were em-
ployed, there would have been
a full house.

Indeed the ery arises every
vear, “You can’t build a
drama group without student
cunnrort.” After all, Dr. Goody-
koontz: and | are not working
to entertain ourselves, or to
please the administration, or
to romp through college
funds. We are trying to offer
(not force) drama to the stud-
ent body. | fee! thet through
participation and attendance
at Vagebond productions part
of the educational process at
Davidson may be aided. How
much more vatueble to see or
be in @ production of an im-
portent play than to be forced
to read thet same pley in oe
class and be required to fire
back answers to questions
about it.

No, Mr. Ruth, Drama does not
best serve the dramatist. No
dramatist I know of wrote or
writes primarily for his own
pleasure. He writes to communi-
cate. So do most poets, believe it
or not. Thus, the most obvious
thing to do with a play is to
produce it and the best thing to
do with a poem is to read it
aloud. For in order to do either
well, a great deal of study and
thought must go into the pro-
cess. One cannot act out a part
in a play without understanding
that part both as an individual
and in terms of other individ-
uals on the stage, without un-
derstanding what the playwright
is trying to communicate
through the play. In the same
way a poem cannot be read in-
telligently without an under.
standing of what the poet is
trying to say and how he says it.

The Vagabonds do not want
“cheers, banners, parades,” al-
though certain members of the
“Establishment” may at times
offer them as pacifiers. What
the Vagabonds do want is much
more difficult to offer. 1 believe
the Vagabonds want to share
ideas, thoughts, feelings, which
are common to all mankind and
have been so and will remain
as long as a heart beats some-
where. Does the Establishment
really not understand? I believe
it does. However, various spec-
tres, such as Graduate Record
Examinations, reviews, term

papers, etc., may scare an in-
dividual into believing that
since he won't be tested on a
feeling it is not as important to
cultivate as lists of names, dates,
or places.

It is true that “That which
liberates the creativity of one
may not do the same for all.”
That is why the productions
this semester are so varied:
AGAMEMNON, a Greek cless-
ie: THE MAN WHO CAME TO
DINNER, en American come-
dy; GALILEO, an experimen-
tal German play; and now
WINTERSET an American
verse tragedy by Maxwell An-
derson. These are done to en
tertain and to educete, but
primarliy to communicete.
There is no interest in creat
ing 2 “following” or coterie,
8 ghetto, if you will, but In
communicating the greet
pieces of dramatic literature.
The Vagabonds is not Dr.
Goodykoontz, or me, but all
students, faculty and staff
members, and townspeople
who have found in drematics
an educational experience, an
opportunity to go beyond self
in working with others, and
just plain fun.

A drama program designed
with the students in mind, as
the Vagabond season unasham-
edly is. cannot function success-
fully without student attendance
and interest. This is a fact. This
has nothing to do with “liberty”
being “a personal thing” or “a
truly free man” being “an in-
dividual . . . an artist.” This
has to do with flesh and blood
human beings who are concern-

ed enough about their educa-
tion to take time to learn a
part, paint sets, arrange lights,
build costumes, apply make-up,
sell tickets, seat people, spend
fifty cents to see something re-
cognized as being important in
literature. This is a personal
thing. What is worth the time.
energy and money? What are
you at Davidson for? Is it pos-
sible that the Vagabonds do
something worthwhile outside
the classroom, the library, and
the lab? I think so and there
are many Davidsonians who
think so. There are also some
who don't.

This is the personal matter,
whether you are an artist. an
athlete. or a scientist. You don’t

have to cheer, but you owe it

to yourself at this educational
institution to give what the
Vagabonds stand for a chance.

thoroughly disgusted with this
advocate of complete individual-
ism.

First of all, Ferris describes
our society's ability and love
of organization es a “pervert-
ed love.” | maintain that our
society would not heve been
able to advance to the position
of leader of the world’s great
powers had it not been for our
ability to organize.

From the very beginning of

our nation, organization has
been the key to our develop-
ment. As a result of the Con-
stitutional Convention of 1787,
our national government was or-
ganized into three separate
branches: the Legislative, the
Executive, and the Judicial. To-
day this governmental organiza-
tion remains basically the same
as it was in 1787.
* Second, Ferris maintains
that “developments in science,
religion, art, and other disci-
plines have always been the
product of independent
thought; of men seeking an-
swers by themselves.” Let us
examine this statement.

Perhaps the most outstanding
devetopment of all time in the
field of science has been the
exploration of outer space. Can
anyone be so naive as to believe
that this exploration of outer
space could have been achieved
solely by the efforts of one in-
dividual? Come now, let's be
realistic. Granted, there have
been cases of isolated individ-
uals who have made important
scientific discoveries by them-
selves, but this certainly is not
always the case, as Ferris stout-
ly maintains.

Ferris also says that develop-
ments in the field of religion
“have always been the product
of independent thought.” Let us
look at the Christian religion
and at the Person who is the
center of that religion, Jesus
Himself. He was the organizer
of perhaps the most influential
group or committee, as you
wish, ever assembled, the group
of the twelve disciples. Had it
not been for the efforts of this
group and the disciples follow-
ing them working together to-
wards a common goal after the
death of Christ, Christianity
would not have developed into
a religion with advocates on

PRANtL ES

AND D0 YOU KNOW WHO
DISCOVERED IT?

every continent of the world.
& vid this phenomenal
growth have been possible
through the efforts of one in-
dividual? Agein, of course not.
Granted, it was Christ who
formulated the basic tenets
of Christianity, but Christian-
ity es a world-wide religion «
could not have developed

without the aid of efficient |

organization. Hed it not been
for the organization loosely
designated as the Early Chris-
tien Church, Christ and -His
teachings would have soon
been forgotten.

Ferris continues by implying
that this “perverted love’ of
group activity is also prevalent
in the Davidson students and'
that the Davidson student has
used group activity as a means
of escaping from viewing him-
self as he really is. I suppose
that Ferris believes that a per-
son can come to a point of self-
Tealization by sitting uncomfort-
ably in a carrel] in the basement
of the library amid musty vol-
umes engrossed in independent
thoughts of greatness. ,

This existence, | maintain,
is an escepe from reality to s
fer greeter degree than be-
coming involved in worth-
while student activities. A
person cannot come to a rea-
lization of his own capacities
in a vacuum, as Ferris seems
to maintain, but cen only de-
termine them through verious
associations with other people
and through various activities.

Finally, Ferris states that if
we are “to face life responsibly,‘
these chains binding us to the
group must be broken.” That is,
we must all become unfettered
individuals seeking “truth”
alone in solitary confinement
without the aid of others and
without caring about others and
their search.

Are we responsible only to
ourselves, to the big I? Do we
not have responsibilities to
others with whom we live and
associate, such as our parents,
our friends, our school, our
country, and our God? Of course
we do. What a disorganized and
chaotic society we would have
if at least some people didn't
realize they had responsibilities
to others besides themselves.
