N. C. State at Greensboro Memorial
Stadium. Kick off at 8 p. m.

We come now to Davidson's first Big

Five tilt, and one which many believe
will have important bearing on the way
the two contestants finish in the = state

race. It is the earliest that Davidson has
met one of its important state opponents
in a Jong time.

The game is almost certain to pack
the Greensboro bowl to capacity. Due
to settle with Davidson, because of
the possible championship nature of

the contest, and last but not least,

since it is the first game of import-

ance in the state to be played at
night, it is generally considered that
the crowd will be a sell out.

John Van Liew, mentor of the Tech-
nicians serving his first at the
position’ vacated by Gus Tebell. With a
championship freshman team offering the
cream of its talent, and with two or three

is year

of the star veterans back from last year,

Van Liew has a wealth of material to
work with. He will receive his rst test
as a coach against Davidson, and will

likely shoot the works to-win.

The showing of the Wildcats against
Elon was a disappointment to some, mecre-
ly satisfactory to others, and eminently
successful in the eves of a few. We are
inclined to consider ourselves in the second
group. At times during the second half |
the line and backfield were working te
gether in a manner beautiful to behold,
but except for the opening drive in. the
first half, the play during that stanza was
far below what it should have been.

One of the most pleasing aspects of

the contest was the way in which
both the first and second string teams
functioned. It was hard to say which
looked the better, for each was able
to gain regularly. However bright this
may look from the standpoint of re-
serve power, it says very little about
the true strength of the material as a

whole.
Those in the stands who came to see |
Captain Pete Williams repeat his last

year’s performance of stealing the show |
were disappointed. FFor the Elon leader
could get started only once on a run, and
other than for that one time, never gain-
ed more than three yards on any one play.
His passing proved a serious threat at |
times, and he backed up the line capably |
but not brilliantly. That is as much as we
can say for him.

If Davidson meets a team that has a
real passing game, as it certainly will, |
things are apt to go bad. Elon com-
pleted half its passes, but about two-
thirds of the other heaves were in-

complete because the receiver was not
quite at the place where the ball was,
rather than that no one was there to
keep the ball from him.

This week's grid menu looks more ap-
petizing than did that of last Saturday,
both locally and nationally, with two Big |

Among the games booked, with the way

Wake Forest 0; Clemson 20, Wofford 7.
Anyhow, that’s our story and we stick
to it.
