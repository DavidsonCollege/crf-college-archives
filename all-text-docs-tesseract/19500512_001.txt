STUDENT BODY ELECTIONS ARE CONCLUDED

Commencement Address To Be

Given By Assistant Sec. Of State

Assistant Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a Rhodes scholar,
and one of Davidson’s most illustrious alumni, will deliver the
commencement address to the senior elass on June 5. Coming
1o Davidson from Cherokee County, Georgia, by way of Aflan-
1a’s publie schools, Mr. Rusk made a splendid record at David-

son. Besides working his way
through school as a teller in the
local bank, he played varsity bas-
ketball and tennis, became presi-
dent of the YMCA and battalion
C. O. of the ROTC, and was elect-
ed to Phi Beta Kappa and ODK,
This formidable pesformance won
him a Rhodes Scholarship, and
while at Oxford he received the
Cecil Peace Prize (1933), a $500
award which made peace with his
creditors, if not with the rest of
the world.

From Oxford, Dean Rusk went
to the University of Berlin, where
he saw Hitler ascend to power.
While keeping up his reserve offi-
cer's ‘status and studying law at

the University of California, he}

taught political science at Mills Col-
lege, Oakland, Cal., in the years
before the war. During his last se-
mester of law school, however, he
was called into the army as a cap-
tain, and just missed being assign-
ed to Bataan. At the last minute he
was reassigned to Military Intelli-
gence in Washington. Throughout
the war he held vatious high posts
in the China-Burma-India Theatre,

Seminary President
Addresses Students

Dr..J. M. Richards, President of
Columbia Theological Seminary
and President of Davidson’s Board
of Trustees, conducted the student
worship program on the morning
of May 8 in Chambers Auditorium.

Dr. Richards was introduced by
Bill Smith, secretary of the YMCA
here, Mr. Smith announced that Dr.
Richards would be on Davidson's
campus for the remainder of the
day and would be available to boys
who wished to speak privately with
Dr. Richards about the ministry
or Columbia Seminary.

The text used by Dr. Richards
for his devdtional, was part of the
third chapter of Philippians. He es-.
pecially stressed the thirteenth and
fourteenth verses which read:
“Brethren, I count not myself to
have apprehended: but this one
Ring I do, forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching
forth unto those things which are
before —I press toward the mark
for the prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Jesus.”

In the course of his talk, Dr.
Richards related, as an illustration
of a point in his presentation of the
text, a true story of a Davidson
track meet in which the senior Da-
vidson 440 man, who already had
his track letter, slackened his pace
so that a Davidson freshman behind
him could pass him to win first
place and thereby recieve his let-
ter.

According to Dr. Richards, this
incident in the track meet happened
while he was a student at Davidson.

Dr. Richards graduated from Da-
vidson in 1922 and went to Oxford
as a Rhodes Scholar.

mory. All delegates enjoyed the

Sigma Chapter who enjoyed it the
most—they came home with the
cup,

Dr. Lewis B. Schenck has been
granted sufficient funds by the Car-
negie Foundation to travel to Eur-
ope this summer to do research on
the nature of the church, especial-
ly concerning the place of the child
in it. Dr. Schenck has been chosen
for this honor because of his inter-
est and previous study in this sub-
ject.

In 1943 an address by Karl Barth,
noted Swiss theologian, focused the
attention of European leaders upon
the importance of the nature of
the church to our generation and
Dr. Schenck’s work will follow this

Dr. Schenck will sail from New
York on the Swedish liner Fernsed
the last of this month and will land
in Genou, Italy. He will spend the
summer mostly doing research is

Basil in Switzerland and in con-

$200.

‘ A special award was presented to

self-denying management of the
Students store at Davidson for the
last eighteen months, building a
successful business from it since

intellectual

In the way of a brief introduction
to the presentations, President Cun:
ningham explained that there weri
three criteria by which a person
could “measure his progress. He
could compare himself with:

(1) Himself — over a period of
years,

(3) Others — to see how his
achievements appeared in the light
of those of others.

(3) His ideal — God's will.

Dr. Cunningham said we all fall
far short of our goal, and use on-
ly a few of our abilities. We are
commanded, “Be ye perfect.” The
best thing that could happen to a
Davidson student would be for him
to get a glimpse of what he could
do, and set his goal on that. The
boys chosen for these awards were
judged, subject to normal human
failure in perception by the judges,
to have most successfully followed
this course.
