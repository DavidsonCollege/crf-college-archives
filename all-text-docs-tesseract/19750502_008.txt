Boswell paces Cats in S.C. tournament

- By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Contributing Editor

Putting together what head
coach Jeff Frank called a
“super team effort’, the David-
son College tennis squad cap-
tured third place finish in the
Southern Conference Tennis
Tournament at Charleston, S.C.
last weekend.

Tallying the number of upset
wins the Cats scored, Frank
said that 10 Davidson wins were
from underdog positions, while
only one match was lost in
which the Cats were favored.

Davidson finished with 2
points for the event, just four
behind second-place Furman.
Appalachian won the title going
away with 65 of a possible 72
points.

Two Cat netters took con- |

ference crowns in their respec-
tive brackets. Stuart Boswell,
playing in the number five
singles, was seeded third going
into the affair. But after’ an
easy win in the first round, he
upset second-seeded Graham
Hatcher of Appalachian in a
semifinal comeback, 4-6,7-6,6-3.
Then he toppled top-ranked
Mark Stone of Furman 6-1,6-3 in
easy fashion in the finals.

Rick Quinby, who has played
the top singles slot for the Cats
all season, was seeded fifth in
the first round. Consequently,
his 6-2,3-6,6-3 win over William
& Mary’s Mare Abrams was
considered another upset. Then
he faced two-time defending
champion David Richardson of
Appalachian. In a losing effort,
the Cat senior scored more
games against Richardson than
any other player in the tourney,
gong down in a hard fought 7-
5,7-5 struggle. Quinby came
right back the final day and
took the playoff match for third
place over third -seeded John
Leitch of Richmond 6-3,3-6,6-1.

At the fourth singles, Mike
Barnhill also pulled upset wins

round, but then dropped to

Robert Galloway of William &
Mary. He came back in the
playoff, however, to dump Jim
Hall of Furman, 6-0.7-6. Hall
had beaten Barnhill in straight
sets during the regular season.

Chip Bondurant, the number
two player for the Cats, suf-
fered from the seedings and
ended up playing Furman.
Jerry Robinson in -the first
round. He lost a close three set
match 6-0, 5-7, 7-6, forcing him
to move into the losers bracket.
He got the next two wins.
though, and netted four team
points as he finished fifth.

John Mitchell, who was
seeded sixth in the third singles
area, had not fully recovered
from a recent illness and drop-
ped a three-setter to Peter
Steinhouser. He also lost
another three-set match to Don
Ball in the playoff for fifth
place.

Frank was naturally pleased
with the performance of the
singles players. Most of them,
he felt, played some of the best
tennis he has seen them play the
entire season.

Doubles did not go as well for
the Cats. The third doubles
team of Greg Dunn and Mitchell
went into the tourney seeded
second. After sweeping through
the first round, they were upset
in the semis by the duo from
William & Mary instraight sets.
They also dropped the playoff
for third place in straight sets to
Appalachian.

The top doubles was one of the
event’s big surprises as far as
the Cats were concerned. Quin-
by and Boswell were seeded six-
th, which Frank called a gift
considering they only won one
regular season match. But they
upset a tough Citadel duo by a
score of 6-4,4-6.6-4. After being
beaten in the semis, they came
back to capture third place
with ‘another upset win in

for the Cats. Seeded third in the \ straight sets over Furman, 7-

he won the opening

affair,

6,6-2.

Finally in the number two
doubles, the Cat duet of Bon-
durant and Barnhill were
seeded fourth. They too won
their opening match in three
sets before losing to the top
seeded team from Appalachian
in the semifinals. But they
roared back on the final day to
take a 3-6.6-3.6-2 comeback win
over third-seeded Richmond for
the plavoff victory and a third
place finish.

The finish was much better
and stronger than most ex-
pected the Cats to do, according
to Frank. Because of this, he is
very pleased with the per-
formances of his players.

“Even though we won the
tournament the first year I was
here, I don’t think I have ever
had a more gratifying Southern
Conference’ -tournament.’’
Frank solemnly noted, ‘‘The at-
titude of the team was great and
they just put everything
together.

‘For the first time we peaked

at the Tourney. We had to have
a big dav on the third and final
day of the tournament. We did,
and that made the difference.”

On that final day. the Cats
competed in nine matches and
came away with seven of them,
four coming over arch rival
Furman.

Steve Holman also crushed a
Citadel opponent in the opening
round and followed it with a
straight set win over William &
Mary’s Nick O’ Hara 6-3,6-1 in
the semifinals. He then whipped
another Paladin opponent, Bob
Schott, 6-1,6-7.6-1, for the title in
the sixth slot.

Frank praised both these
players, saving thay they have
each played the ‘‘toughest ten-
nis that they have played all
year.’’ Each tallied eight team
points for the Cats by winning
their respective divisions.

Frank concluded by _ ex-
plaining that of the seven
players who participated in the
event for Davidson, three are
freshmen and another is a
