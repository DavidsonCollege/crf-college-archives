Residence Life Eliminates Clusters for 1993-94

By Shaye Benton

If you have caught the latest
newsconceming campus living ar-
rangements, you have probably

‘reacted — are you irate, pleased,
or indifferent? Or perhaps you
have notheard about the recent stir
down at the RLO....

Beginning the fall of 1993,
Davidson College upperclassmen
will not be allowed to cluster when
choosing dorm rooms. Under the
new policy released by Residence
Life, groups of students cannot pool

Statement of
Purpose
Under Heavy
Scrutiny

By Leigh Rawdon
According to thecollege's cur-
rent Statement of Purpose,
"Davidson maintains therefore, that
acollege must be a worshipping as
well as a studying community, if it

their lottery numbers and move on
tohallsin acluster. Instead, room-
mates must choose a room
independend of their friends.

The change in policy responds
to concern over the past several
months about integration among
students. While Residence Life
has always enforced social affili-
ate restrictions on every hall, the
Office still received student com-
ments on the tendencies of stu-
dents to limit themselves to one
group. Richard Terry, Director of

Residence Life, States in theprinted
explanation of thenew policy: “We
want to continue to commit our-
selves to the promotion of open-
ness to new people and new ways
of life.”

According to Terry, Residence
Life has discussed this change for
the lasttwo years. However, RLO
considered enacting this policy for
next Fall after they recently con-
ducted RA interviews. The great-
est concern for the RA candidates,
according to Terry, was the lack of

interaction among Students in dif-’
ferentclusters, even if they lived on
the same hall.

Students recently have raised
concerns about being thrown into a
new situation after having worked
freshman or sophomore year to
build friendships. Terry believes
most students will not be isolated
when choosing rooms. He said that
friends most likely will continue to
live on the same halls; they just
may not live next door to one an-
other. Residence Life hopes that

since students may have to walk
down the hall to visit friends they
will also meet the people in be-
tween.

Nevertheless, some students
are angry over the policy. Thad
Reece and Jay Jennings disagree
with the change. “In an attempt to
spare the feelings of ahypothetical
few who might be injured in some
way by clustering, the RLOis forc-
ing upperclassmen to relive the

The Trustees recently ap-
pointed a committee to study the
Statement of Purpose. The review

sive self study done every ten years

ticular interest because the atmo-
sphere on campus seems to call for
inclusiveness, according to Dr.
Alexander McKelway, professor
of Religion.

“In general there is a desire
that the statement be more explicit
about the college’s commitment to
inclusiveness,” says McKelway.

move from the statement the lan-

After a three year drought, it snowed in Davidson Thursday night. It didn't last long, though,
and few snowballs were seen flying around campus.

Eating House Changes Considered

By Rachel Dunifon

A Patterson Court Women’s
Committee, established to address
the concerns of women in relation
to Patterson Court, has been con-
sidering ways of improving the
social atmosphere of Davidson as
awhole. The committee was initi-
ated by PCC president Julie Petty,
Connor Vice-President Lorie
Logan, and Political Science Pro-

fessor Mary Thornberry. The in-
formal group has met several times
throughout this semester, and wel-
comes anyone interested in attend-
ing.

According to Petty, the com-
mittee was originally formed out
ofa desire to establish a better way
of coordinating self-selection ac-
tivities between the three women’s
eating houses. The committee also

20 Years of Women at Davidson

By Yvette Pita
Life at Davidson before co-
education was “like living at the
YMCA” according to Mark
Armstrong ‘77. He recalls upper-
classmen telling him about the old

days whenmen didn’tneed to think
about personal hygiene. He laughs
and says, “Once the women en-
rolled, students bathed and shaved
more often.”

The first year of the transition

was difficult for Davidson. Some
male students not in favor of the
change wereafraid that they would
lose most of their traditions. They
continued "importing" women for
social funtions and the Homecom-
ing’Court. According to Susan
Jonas, “We made the Queens girls
upset when we insisted that we
should start being the cheerleaders
for the football team. After all, it
was our school team.”

Twenty years later, women's
presence is felt in the classroom, in
organizations, and on the playing
field. In addition, they have cre-
ated a healthier environment for
the college. Thank the women of

- Davidson for cleaner, better- sea

ing students.

Davidson," pages 6 & 7.

addresses ways to combat the ste-
reotyping of the three houses,
which some believe has been an
increasing problem, affecting the
self-selection process, and limit-
ing houses’ diversity.

While addressing these issues,
the group also focused its attention
on the wider issue of male-female
interaction at Davidson—an area
that most participants in the meet-
ings feel needs improvement.
According toJunior Amy Howard,
who has attended several of the
meetings, the committee wants “to
facilitate more male-female inter-
action on campus. It is important
to bring males and females together
ina different atmosphere than what
is found at most parties.”

One means of facilitating this

THIS WEEK

Faculty
Promotes Rape

Awareness

By Sally Stone

Twenty years of women at

Davidson is reason to celebrate. It
also means a time to exercise pre-
caution. In moder society cam-
pus acquaintance rape runs ram-
pant and Davidson College is not
immune. At some point in their
college career one in six women
will be raped: A new pamphiet
from the Dean of Students’ office
deals with this issue.

The pamphlet and the student
run Rape Awareness committee
were originated to spearhead pre-
cautionary efforts. The newest
campus group to join the rape
awareness movement is the Fac-
ulty Women’s Group.

On Tuesday, February 23, the
members of this group, Drs.
Thornberry, Moore, Gray, Curran,
McMillen, Gibson, Dietz, Molinek,
Pena, and MacNeil introduced
themselves to the women’s eating
houses. Three professors visited
each house to express their group’s
concem for Davidson women’sand
men’s safety in the growing cli-
mate of date rape.

The Faculty Women’s Group
is an advocacy organization wish-
ing to extend their support to vic-
tims of sexual assault. They realize
they are not trained counselors,
butrecognize that in mostinstances
victims need a listening ear. They
also mean to provide an additional
option from whom victims may
choose to seek help. This way, the
professors stressed, victims may
feel more comfortable coming for-
ward.
