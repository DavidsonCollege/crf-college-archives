Missing Clothes At"
Laundry Presents

Problem To Students

By Sean Lind

It starts in little ways: a sock
here, ahandtowel there, maybe at-
shirt. But although such minor
inconveniences are bound to hap-
pen due to the “dryer ate my socks”
phenomenon, the recent loss of
clothes in the Davidson laundry is

- becoming a real problem.

There are three possible ways
in which clothes can be lost: they
can become misplaced due to the
vast voume of clothing the laundry

: processes; they can be accidently
_ taken by other students; or, they

can be stolen by non-Davidsoni-

The first possibility is a given.

_ The laundry processes anywhere

from 15,250-18,000 Ibs. of clothes

per week, With such a large load, .
_ misplacements are inevitable. _

Thesecond possibility is alittle

more disheartening. The laundry

is under the Honor Code, but mis-'

_ takes can happen. Even so, once
» these mistakes are realized, stu-
~ dents should return the mistaken
- items.

The third is the worst scenario.

As in many other areas of
- Davidson’ssheltered existence, the
- Honor Code binds the students,
-but it can have no effect of non-

Davidsonians or locals.
Mrs. Frances Beaver, the laun-

dry manager, stated that the laun-

dry does take certain precautions
to prevent theft. “Students and
employees are the only ones with
access behind the counter,” said
Mrs. Beaver.

I took the liberty to test the
security in the laundry. Last Thurs-
day, [hada janitor, who is approxi-
mately 35 years old and looks
nothing a Davidson student, pick
up my laundry. He walked in, got
my clothes, and brought them
outside to me. He was never
stopped or questioned.

Each student pays $189 per
semester for laundry service. The
laundry is a break-even business
tun solely for the convience of
students.

Carelton Pritchard, Directorof
Auxilary Services, admitted that
the loss of clothes is a problem,

‘and stated that the laundry was

trying to find a solution.

Students who have lost clothes
in the laundry, says Pritchard, can
putin aclaim for these items. Once
claims are filed, the laundry inves-
tigates the loss to try and discover
the problem. - Then students are
reimbursed, taking into account
devaluation.

Pritchard also said the laundry
is planning a full-scale renovation
this summer: The refurbishment
will include new machines, and a
new security system.

Davidson Featured In National
Review's New College Guide

By Jay Chaudhuri

Davidson was featured in the
national spotlight again when it
was recently included in William
F. Buckley Jr.’s The National

Review College Guide as one of
the 50 top liberal arts schools in
the nation.

The liberal arts colleges se-
lected by the guide emphasized
good teaching, Western-oriented
academic curriculums and
“schools that have not supplanated
education with political indoctri-
nation.”

Titled “Focus on the) Class-
room’ the editors praise Davidson
for its “outstanding teaching, an
honor system that is regarded as
the ‘touchstone’ of college life,
rigorous academic standards, and
a conservatism, both social and
political, reflected in the school’s
culture.”

The guide is critical of
Davidson’s “Cultural Diversity
Requirement,” however; it con-
siders the courses offered in this
area as legitimate and well within
the college’s liberal arts tradition.
__. The guide is most.critical of
Davidson’s involvement in\Lead-
ership South, a consortium of five
Southern colleges targeted at in-
creasing opportunities for blacks
in highereducation. Italso.notes
with disappointment Davidson’s
affirmative action policy in hiring
black faculty members and its of-
fering of: ae concentration in

“ethnic studies.”

Vice-President for Academic
Affairs Robert Williams has ap-
plauded the guide for praising the
college’s teaching and honor code,
but finds it criticism’s disturbing.

“It is a list that is politically
determined in nature and factually
incorrect for some national col-
leges that the National Review
would like to see as very conserva-
tive. Although their emphasis on
teaching and the honor code are
applaudable we regret the National
Review’ s perspective that women
on faculty and diversity require-
ments are signs of decline for
Davidson. We view these steps as
progressive.”

Associate professor of politi-
cal science and chairperson of the
Gender Studies program Mary
Thornberry shares William’s sen-
timent.

- “Tagree with them about what
they liked at Davidson. However,
I am upset at the notion that the
recruiting of African-American fac-
ulty members lessens our stan-
dards. It is quite an insult to the
faculty.to who we have hired; they
are a great addition.”

Assistant professor of classical
studies and chairperson of the ad-
visory committee on racial/ethnic
minority concern Micheal Touma-
zou has expressed similiar concern
with. the guide’s criticism’s on
minority recruiting.

“The guide assumes that if you

hire minorities you have lowered
standards. This is a false assump-
tion as far as lam concerned. Our
reputation is getting better while
we diversify our faculty. Obvi-

‘ously, this has not affected our

image of improving academically.”

Reacting to the regrets cx-
pressed by Williams and other
faculty members, Brad Miner,
editor of the guide, said, “Iam not
surprised. I don’t mind ita bit that
he (Williams) is spouting off be-
cause I think it will alert people
that there is something good in our
book. Anytime academics do start
to spout off like that I think it is a
signal to sensible people."

"There is plenty of diversity in
the traditional curriculum. I think
what we see in many of these re-
quirements are a political intent."

Research for guide was under-
taken, according to Miner, by writ-
ing away for materials from each
school. Although interviews were
conducted oncampus by telephone,
The National Review plans to
expand the methodology by in-
cluding campus visits.

Campaign For Davidson
Slightly Over Halfway Mark

By Gary Wheeler
The Campaign for Davidson
is slightly ore eee amtemnecnnd
million target.
“The college has assiduousiy
and generously made a-commit-
mentto the Campaign,” said Jamie

~ May, executive director of devel-

opment. The massive fundraising
effort is intended, in part, to bring
Davidson’s endowment closer to
that of other well respected liberal
arts schools. “Compared to most
of those schools,” May said,

_ “Davidson is grossly undercapi-

talized.” By increasing Davidson’s
endowment through fundraising
some pressure can be taken off of
tuition and fees as a source of
capital.

The campaign, which was
publicly announced in November
of 1989, actually began much ear-
lier. May explained that major
fundraising campaigns are not
publicly announced until a sub-
stantial amount of money has al-
ready been raised. May said that
approximately $60 million had

been raised before the announce-

ment of the campaign.

While the campaign is going
well, there is nota lack of ideas on
how the money can be spent. The
trustees, administration, and fac-
ulty have been busy prioritizing the
college’s needs, which include
increased financial aid, money for
renovations and new facilities.

May projects that the $150-

June of 1995. That means between
$17 and $19-million in commit-
ments will have to be made each
year. Meeting these goals will be
particularly challenging consider-
ing the downturn in the economy
and the fact that the business phi-
lanthropy is morecompetitive than
ever. “Everybody is asking,” May
said, “and donors havexo decide

million goal will be reached by where they will give.”
