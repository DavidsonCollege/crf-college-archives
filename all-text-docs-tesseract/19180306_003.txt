In a simple home wedding last Satur-
day evening at 7 o'clock, C. F. Allen,
"19, and Miss Sarah L. Stiles, of
Mooresville, were quietly married. The
bride’s father is superintendent of .one
of the cotton mills of Mooresville and
as the family had previously lived in
Davidson, the bride was well known by
many here. Rev. W. A. Jenkins offici-
ated, using the impressive ring ceremony.
Only a few of the friends of the couple
were present. The bride’s brother, Dale| ff
Stiles, acted as best man, while a friend,
Miss Mary Cornelius, of Mooresville,
was the bridesmaid. The bride has been
teaching near Mooresville during the
past winter and the groom attending col-
lege. It is understood that Mr. and
Mrs, Allen will continue their present
occupations for the present at least. Con-
gratulations from a host of friends are
extended to them.
