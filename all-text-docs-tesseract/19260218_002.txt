Cagemen to Play Three
Games in Annual Tour
Against State Schools

State, Duke and Carolina to be En-
countered During Four-Day Trip

On Saturday morning the Wildcat basket-
ball team will leave on its road trip through
the Old North State, this being the final trip
of the season. On Saturday night the Wild-
cats will meet the Wolfpack at N. C. State.
On their journey to Davidson, the N. C.
State team defeated the Wildcats and the
game the night of the 20th will be a struggle
throughout since the Davidson team will be
fighting to avenge the defeat handed them
earlier in the season, Sunday will be spent
in Raleigh and the Davidson team will rest
up for the strenuous games of the following
week.

Leaving Raleigh, the team will go to Dur-
ham, where they are scheduled to meet the
Duke team Monday night, the 22nd. This
will also be, in a way, a grudge battle, since
| the Wildcats succeeded in downing the Duke
|team by the narrow margin of one point
when they visited Davidson on their South-
ern trip. In this encounter the teams seemed
very evenly matched and in the coming game
the going will be hot and heavy throughout.
The Duke team has improved in every re-
spect since the battle at the first of the sea-
son and the Wildcats will have a hard time in
subduing them again.

The final game of the trip, as now sched-

uled, will be at Chapel Hill, when the Da-
vidson team mects the University of North
Carolina, Southern  inter-collegiate cham-
pions of last year. This will be the only
game between the two institutions during this
season and each of the rivals is anxious to!
score a victory over the other. In dope, the’
Tar Heels have a great advantage, and the
only optimistic hope for the Davidson team
seems to be that of holding them to a low
score. In its recent Northern trip, the Caro-
lina team met some of the foremost teams of
the East and made a most commendable
showing before them, while the Davidson |
team has been running only a little over
mediocre form. After this game the Wild-
cat team returns to its lair for the final game
of the season,
The curtain for the 1926 season will be!
rung down on the night of the 27th, when
Citadel met here at Davidson. The
Charleston team has made a fine record so
far this season, and the Davidson team
will have no little difficulty in downing them. |
The Furman team, which defeated Davidson
last Saturday night, was whipped by the.
Citadel team by nearly a 20-point margin. |
This game will mark the formal closing of
the season, :

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

In this issue of The Davidsonian formal

announcement i\ made of the high, school ,

track meet that is to be staged at Davidson

on Saturday afternoon, March 27th, which’

will be received by the students with inter-
est. The affair of last year is recalled, and
it is the firm intention of Coach Tilson to
make this far exceed the first attempt.

Back home there may be a coach who
needs a little urging to bring his team here.
The students can add their bit to the idea by
exerting their influence toward getting as
many teams here as possible. Then show an
interest in the high school men when they
arrive as our guests.

Thought last week that we might make a,
little comment on the Freshman team. Look-
ing over the scorcbook for their swing over
the state, however, we will let you judge for
yourself, by looking at the account of their
trip.

Baseball began Monday afternoon, with 18
men on hand, But with wrestling and bas-
kethall still occupying the stage, several good
men are kept from the practice. The first
day’s crew is not indicative of the final num- |
ber Coach Monk Younger will have to work
with when he takes charge on March Ist.
Until this Captain Alford will wear the title
of Coach-Captain Alford.

The mind of Coach Monk is already work-
ing on his baseball team, Not satisfied (how
could he be?) with the result of last season,
he is going to try various combinations which
might or might not reveal hidden basball
players. Captain Alford at present has come

jin from the gardens and is letting the pitch-

er’s heaves reveberate in resounding thuds in

,a catcher’s mit.

If the weather stays like it is today, said
Coach Tilson, Monday night, track “practice
will start within a day or two.

But we are a bit mournful when we think
of the track team this year being minus the
service of the “war-horse” sprinter. Hopes
were high, we were feeling fine; but hopes
have diminished and we are feeling sad. But’
not pessimistic. We have some hard work-
ers. Certainly were glad to se Alf Brand

|come back after a month or two vacation,

and we hope his leg will permit running.

The cold chill blasts of a winter’s day will
he wished for by the football squad Saturday
afternoon, when they will again line up in|
battle array for the first football game of |
the spring practice. The referee’s whistle
will sound good, and will take us back to last
fall when the Wildcats made an enviable
football record. Many notable faces will be
missed from the line-up.

Austin College has adopted a new plan
of having the professors visit the rooms
of the students in their dormitories.
These visits are not of an official nature
but purely on a friendly basis. The
faculty has come to the conclusion that
they can do more good by getting in
closer touch with the student and dis-
cussing purely personal problems with
them than they can by impersonal class-

room discussions of technical subjects.—

Hampden-Sidney Tiger.

side Academy have been promised the dele-
gates, {
Other North Carolina institutions which |
are members of the association are: Duke, |
Carolina, N. C. C. W., Salem, and State.

CORRECTION

Captain Bill Cox and Downing
wrestled fifteen minutes to a draw
in the Davidson-V. P. I. meet in- -
stead of Cox losing as was report-
ed by the press dispatches from
Blacksburg. Downing had pre-
viously won from University of
North Carolina, North Carolina
State, Washington and Lee and
University of Virginia. The same.
was true of Barr, whom Joe Frier-
son defeated on time.

The showing of these two Da-
vidson men was one of the brightest
spots of the match.

HIGH-PRICED LITERATURE

He wrote her eyes were azure
As the sky on a perfect day;

He wrote her hair was golden
Like, the sunlight’s fairest ray.

He wrote her lips were crimson
As the cherry at its vescyo :
He wrote her beauty thrilled him
Deep in his manly chest.

But ah! he wed another!
And when the maiden heard. |
She sold him back his letters
At twenty dollars a word.

Down at Wesleyan College at Macon, ;
Ga., several girls have formed a club for!
the preservation of the Queen's English. |
Such words as dog-gone require a fine of |
5 cents fro mthe offender. There are’
others just a little stronger that cost the!

user ten cents. Then there are those

(and they fail to illustrate) that are so
bad that a quarter is required of the
one so unlucky as to be overheard using
them. The fines go to a common treas-
ury, probably to be used in paying their
date’s car-fare or to buy rouge for the
“everlasting bumming element.” These
rules were very thoughtfully suspended
however, during exams, in order to allow
a free usage of the English language.

Although V. P. I. won from Davidson in
wrestling last Saturday afternoon, it was a
thrilling mat tilt, and we haven’t and reason
to believe but that we will make a bid for
state honors.

Viewed from any angle,

these spring suits are the
finest lot we ever cast our

optics on.

They not only have the
necessary collegiate swank-
iness about them, but they
reflect quality from fore to

aft.

A lot more could be said
about them, but we’d rather
have you see them your-
self, Drop down some
P. M. and try on a few of
them.
