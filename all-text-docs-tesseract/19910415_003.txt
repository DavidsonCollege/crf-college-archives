The person will then be able to
talk back and forth with the dis-
patcher by just hitting the button.

Thrower believes that this
system will help alleviate hesita-
tion about calling for an escort.
The phones are radio transmitted
and will be installed in the next
thirty days. In this first phase,
there will be seven phgnes in-
stalled. There will be six on
campus at the major parking lots
and isolated areas, and one at the
lake campus.

The phones will be placed i in
such a way in the parking lots,
that the person does not have to
leave their car to call. Therefore,
they can wait in their car until the
officer arrives.

Thrower said that they intend
to install around 21 phones in the
next three years. Phase II will put
more of these phones on campus
next year. Thrower also said that
Public Safety is installing phones
in the Dana, Martin, Cunning-
ham, and ‘Chambers academic
buildings. These phones will be
red and on the campus system.
Therefore, a person only needs to
dial the number to get an escort.

always in committee of the whole,
so none of the information has
- been public untilnow. The coun-
cil is a group of 11 students who
will examine the concerns and
problems of minority students
on the Davidson campus. The
SGA minutes contain the precise
outlines of the purpose of the
council for those interested in
more details.

Cammie Covington reported
that the administration is still ac-
tively looking into placing more
‘ coin-operated Xerox machines

‘| around campus, but there are

many academic departments that
