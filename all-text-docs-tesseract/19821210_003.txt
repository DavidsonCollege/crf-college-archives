To the Editor:

I really appreciate your articles on
the good and bad things on campus. |
just wanted to tell you how much I’ve
enjoyed them. Especially the first arti-
cle. I, too, have long been an apprecia-
tor of phallic symbols. I’m so glad
they’re so multudinous here on campus,
and *> the creators of these marvelous

GOOD- BYE, DAD.

erections I have but one thing to say:
“Seep it up, guys.”

Sincerely,
A Co-ed

P.S.—Newest phallic symbol for the
holidays: E.T.’s finger. It even glows!

QUEST’S END

THE FUNERAL WAS
A SIMPLE ONE. A
FEW FRIENDS AND
RELATIVES say “IM
SORRY“ AND IT’S
OVER. FOR THE SON,

A LAST WORD AND
HE WILL BE GONE.

To the Editor:

We would like to take this opportu-
nity to alert everyone to the campus-
wide clothing drive sponsored annually
by Davidson Christian Fellowship. The
collection will begin immediately fol-
lowing Christmas break and will run
from January 3 to 7. To insure optimal
success for this cause we urge students
to collect clothing from home during the
holidays and then bring the clothes back
to Davidson. Students should deposit
their clothing in appropriately marked
boxes located in Vail Commons or their
respective eating houses. Faculty and
staff members are encouraged to assist
us in the clothing drive also, so there
will be boxes in Chambers building for
their convenience.

The clothing collected this year will
be donated to the Crisis Assistance Min-
istry of Charlotte. This organization
will then distribute them to the needy in
Mecklenburg County and surrounding
areas.

Our thanks go to all who will partici-
pate in this worthy cause.

Letters Policy

The Davidsonian welcomes let-
tcrs from our readers. We try to print
all letters that are of general interest,
but we adhere to these four guide-
lines:

|. We require that letters be in our
hands by Tuesday 7 p.m.

2. We require that letters be neatly
typed.

3. We require that letters be
signed and include the author's phone
number and address. If you have a
compelling reason for us to withhold
your name, explain your situation to
the editor, Stewart Cauley.

4. We reserve the right not to print
letters that (a) function as advertise-
ments; (b) contain innuendo, of f-co-
lor slurs, or inside jokes; (c) represent
a viewpoint very similar to that ex-
pressed in many other letters printed
on the same topic. We also reserve the
right to condense very long letters.

The Davidsonian does not in any
way endorse the opinions expressed
in the letters we print.
