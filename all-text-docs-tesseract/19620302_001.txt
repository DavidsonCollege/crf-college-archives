ROTC Move Mauls
Hopes Of Deferment

BY DAVID PEARSALL
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The increasing threat of war and the need to enlarge

the U.S. Armed Forces has prompted the Army to adopt!

a new deferment policy. Consequently, many seniors who
had planned for graduate study next fall will find them-

selves in uniform instead.

In the past, any Davidson
ROTC graduate could be defer-
red from active duty if he were
entering graduate school the
following fall. With the new
policy, only students of dentis-
try, law, medicine, and theology
will be able to enter graduate
school next fall.

EXCEPTIONS POSSIBLE

There are however two possi-
ble exceptions to this ruling.
{f a student is offered a “once
in a life time opportunity”
through a graduate scholarship
that must be used the following
year, he will be granted a de-
ferment.

Also, should the quotas for
ROTC students in active serv ice
become filled, a priority sys-
tem. would be used to enable
deferment for some men so that
they could begin graduate gtudy.

The general fields of study in
order of their priority would
be: (1) associated fields of medi-
cine and psychology; (2) chem-
istry, physies, and math; (3)
languages -_ teaching; @ ‘bie

Vereen Bell Prize
Competition Opens

Candidates for the Vereen
Bell Memorial Award for Crea-
tive Writing must submit en-
tries to any member of the
Department of English by April
7, to be eligible for the award
this year.

The award, which carries a
cash prize of $75, is given every
year by the Vereen Bell Memor-
ial Fund to the student who
shows the greatest promise in
creative writing. The winner,
along with other ranking con-
testants, will be announced in a
student assembly.

Any student of Davidson Col-
lege is eligible to enter the
contest. A student may submit
entries in as many different
categories (poetry, drama, short
stories, etc.) as he wishes, but
he may submit only one entry in
each category with the excep-
tion of poetry. In poetry, a con-
testant may submit one poem,
or a sequence or group of
poems; if he submits more than
one poem, he must designate
them as one unit.

All entries must be typed,
double spaced, and appear on
one side of the paper only. The
name of the writer should be
enclosed in an envelope bear-
ing the title of the entry and
attached to it. No name is to
sapere on the manuscript itself.

tory, journalism, and public re-
lations.
DETAILS COME LATER

Within each of the four prior-
ity groups, deferments would
be granted according to the
date on which the application
was received, All fields of study
within one group would receive
equal priority.

More detailed information on
the new policy can be found on
the bulletia board in the MS II
room of the ROTC Department.
More complete information is
supposed to be released by the
Army sometime next month.
However, this basic change of
deferment policy should con-
tinue indefinitely.

The fraternity has carried out |
several projects for the college
as well as for the community
this year.

It printed the college direc-
tory which was given to all
students. Members run errands
daily for infirmary patients,
getting their mail and books.
The fraternity has provided a
map in the college church with
professors addresses, making
Sunday night visiting less com-
plicated. Its members have also
ushered for college concerts.

The Davidson chapter's of-
ficers this year are President
Tom Martin, Vice President
Tom Patrick, Secretary Walton
McNairy, and Treasurer John
Rankin.

Alpha Phi Omega is the ‘larg-
est men’s fraternity of any kind
in the United States, having
over 300 chapters. The chapter
at Davidson is now in the pro-
cess of being founded. Its work
started last fall and it will apply
for a charter within the next
month.

Davidson’s chapter has about
25 members and can accept a
few more; membership is limit-
ed to about 30 students. A re-
quirement is that a member
must have worked in Scouting
although the fraternity is in no
way affiliated with the Boy
Scouts. Students jnterested in
joining should see Bill Pridgen
or Tom Robinson.

Reid, in commenting on the
change in date said that this
added period of nearly a month
will give extra time for exten-

Chairman Reid is enthusiastic
over the success of the book
and hopes this points to the
possibility of a strong student
interest during Dr. Bennett's
visit.

Plans are now being made for
a panel discussion on the issues
raised by the book. Both sides
will be represented, and Dr.
Bennett will be there to offer
his views.

interested students and faculty le member of Kappa Alpha fra-

members toward this goal. This |
committee wants the emphasis
of Scripts ‘n Pranks to be that
of a true literary magazine.

One idea is to organize the
magazine around new standards
with the editor at its head. He
would be assisted by an advis-
ory staff consisting of repre-
sentatives from each of the or-
ganizations on campus which
might contribute to the maga-
zine. Under the present system
the editor has to begin anew
each year with no standards to
guide him and with no advisory
groups to assist him.

Trask noted that the Student
Council has “requested that the
Publications Board withhold
nominations for editor of
Scripts ‘n Pranks until a solu-
tion can be found which will
assure that Scripts ‘n Pranks
will be an effective student
publication of literary worth.
In order to achieve this purpose,
all elements of the college com-
munity—freshman and _ sopho-
more English classes, creative
writing classes, Sigma Upsilon,
the literary societies, the fine
arts department, and professors
—will find expression.”

ATO's Schedule

ties will participate in the an-
nual Davidson-Queens Olympics
sponsored by the ATO frater-
nity. All proceeds from ticket
sales wili go to charity.

In past years members of the

co-ed basis.

Six teams will be chosen
from the fraternities and sorori-
ties to compete in seven events,
including clothes-changing con-
tests, egg-throwing and a mys-
