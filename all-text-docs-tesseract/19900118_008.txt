Basketball wrap-up

By JOHN BURNS
The Wildcats have the 15th
hardest schedule in the na-
tion, according to USA Today.
Here's a wrap-up of the
games since Christmas
break...

UNCC 67 - Davidson

63

Ouch! This one hurt. An
outgunned, underdog Wild-
cat team made it through the
ice and snow to the Charlotte
Coliseum to play the 49erson
December 8. —

The Cats came out blazing
and pummeled UNCC in the
first half, leading by as many
as 17 points. Every time the
49ers mounted a rally, the
Wildcats snuffed it out with
hot shooting by Paul
Denmond and Magic Gaines.
The hopes of the relatively
small Davidson crowd
soared.

But the second half was
painful to watch as the Cats
continued to play well but
could not stop the ‘Niners at
several crucial points. Poor
officiating also hurt the Wild-
cats, forcing Detlef Musch
and Jay Schmitt to restrain
their play down the stretch.
AJ Morgan said;.“The calls
weren’t too great, but we still
had the opportunity to win,
and we just didn’t do it.”

That opportunity came
with 6.2 seconds left on the
NBA clock. Magic Gaines,
who had played well all
night, and led the Cats with
16 points, misread the clock,
thinking it read 02 seconds

bounded the shot and was
fouled. The shooter hit both
shots and sealed the four
point victory for UNCC.

Duke 89 - Davidson 44

Christian Laettner, Alaa
Abdelnaaby and Bobby
Hurley put ona show at Belk
Arena on December 21 as the
12th-ranked Blue Devils
blew by Davidson in front of
a Christmas-break depleted
crowd.

The Blue Devils, who nor-
mally score over 100 points
per game didn’t break 90, one
of the few bright spots of the
night for the Wildcats.

Another bright spot was
the play of sophomore Paul
Denmond, who scored 12

points.

St. John’s 83 -

Davidson 65

Denmond exploded for 23
points against the 18th
ranked Redmenas Davidson
gave a very respectable
showing against one of the
Big East’s top teams. The
inside game was impressive,
as Detlef Musch pulled down
seven rebounds and showed
what Coach McKillop called
“flashes Of brilliance.” * *

The Cats played tough

throughout the game, and -

finished much closer to St.
John’s than most teams have
this season.

UNC-Asheville 61 -

Davidson 56
The Cats then returned to

Killer schedule leaves ’Cats
winless during break

home. The streak soon went to
12. The Wildcats hit only 39
percent for the night. Paul

‘Denmond led all scorers with.

14. Jay Schmitt totalled 11
rebounds, possibly because of
the number of missed shots
put up by the Cats.

It was the beginning of a
brutal two-game slump.

Campbell 81 -
Davidson 54

27 percent’ shooting,
Denmond sole double-figure
scorer with 13. No comment.

Furman 60 -

Davidson 57
Detlef Muschand the Wild-
cats came alive in the Belk
Arena on Thursday nightand
gave a very good Furman
team a tough battle before
once again falling at the end.
Musch had 18 points on eight
of nine shootings, he showed
an amazing array of left-
handed hooks and fade-away
jumpers. The rest of the team
also played well in the effort.
Both teams threw the ball
away numerous times down
the stretch. Davidson once
again had several opportuni-
ties to put the Paladins away,

after leading the whole game. | |/#

But the Cats couldn’t find the
net after the two-minute
mark.

Furman hit a crucial free
throw with under 20 seconds
leftto go upby three. The Cats
then, bewilderingly, left their
tall, slower lineup in with 10
seconds left. JD Heuer missed

instead of 6.2. He forced a North Carolina to face atough three point shot with
shot from the foul line and UNCA, which held an 11-_ three seconds left and Fur-
missed. A UNCC player re- game winning streak at man escaped witha win.
