“Loyalty to “Our k King” is Dr.

Gillespie’s Subject in Vespers
HOLDS CONFERENCES

Makes Headquarters in “Y” Room
for Two Days to Advise
Students

Dr. Richard T. Gillespie, class of ‘04, now
president of Columbia Theological Seminary,
spoke to the students at the regular Sunday
vesper service on the subject of “Loyalty to
Our King.” In his address Dr. Gillespie
took as the basis of his remarks the text
John 11:16: “Let us also go, that we may
die with him.” He stressed the loyalty of
Christ's disciples and that of some outstand-
ing Christians in history, and concluded with
a strong appeal for loyalty today,
the great need for it.

By way of introduction Dr. Gillespie ex-
plained the event at which the text was ut-
tered by Thomas. Jesus had barely escaped
death in Jerusalem and had gone over beyond
the Jordan. Upon hearing of the illness of
Lazarus He was resolved to return to Jeru-
salem in spite of the fate which He knew
awaited Him there and in opposition to the
wishes of His disciples who tried to dissuade
Him. It was then, when they saw that He

would go, that Thomas declared his loyalty |
by calling on the disciples to go with Him

to almost inevitable dath for all.

“T hav nog gone to a dictionary for a defi-
nition of loyalty.” said the speaker.
it is set hefore us in
Thomas. Loyalty is love finding expression
in service, or better, loyalty is love in-action.
Loyalty to our King is the final characteriza-
tion of a Christian.

“Here
this declaration of

“The earliest disciples had a fine oppor-
tunity to prove their loyalty and on most oc-
casions did prove it. Peter proved his loyalty
when he would have placed a crown on His
head, and again when he drew his sword to
strike the only blow which was offered in
defense of our Lord. John and James wanted

to call down fire to consume a village which ; ‘

refused Christ. Mary and Martha proved
their loyalty by their constant-attention to the
needs and comfort of the Master. Then
Thomas in the words of the text showed the
extent of the loyalty of the disciples.

“We must prove our loyalty fust as well.
Jesus is with us always. One privilege which
the true Christian values most is daily per-
sonal communion with ‘Master. And
there is not a greater need for unswerving
loyalty than phesents itself today. He is
assaulted from every quarter. Concerning
His life, death, even His very nature, foes

_ from every side are combining to wreck His
work, When doubt is creeping into the minds
of men, there is need for men whose lives
are yielded in service.

“The kingdom has extended its border, not
to a tramp, tramp, to the tune of
music, but through loyalty,
service.

our

consecration and
And if the kingdom keeps growing,
it is because you and I and others are loyal
to Him.”

The speaker then reviewed the works of-

some great mean in history, including Abra-
ham, Moses, the disciples, Martin Luther,
John Knox, and David Livingstone, showing
how they were loyal and what their loyalty
cost them.

Then, in making his appeal for loyalty, Dr.
Gillespie said, “My friends, if we would
prove our loyalty we must yield to Him and
follow Him. There comes to us a call of
human need on every hand. Men are spirit-
ually destitute. Moral depravity has spread
everywhere. Today whenever there is human
need, the heart of Jesus is stirred with com-
passion. We find Him pressing one as he set
His face to Jerusalem where there were peo-
ple waiting for His coming. Today, He
calls me and you. The final test of our fit-
ness to call Him Lord is our loyalty to Him.

If we would be true disciples, we must have |

the spirit of Thomas.

“I am glad,’ "he concluded, “that it was
Thomas who said this. He was dull and!
stupid, and was not impulsive. It was
Thomas who said, ‘We know not whither
they go.’ It was Thomas ‘who did not be-
lieve when told of the resurrection. It was
Thomas, slow to understand, who manifested
this best example of loyalty of all disciple-
ship. He turned to His disciples and chal-
lenged them. We must have this spirit of
Thomas. May God help you who have given
your hearts to Christ. May God help you
to -find-in-your soul this spirit of love, and’
thus prove your loyalty to your King.”

Dr. Gillespie impressed his hearers by his
earnestness and sincerity, and by his deep |
consecration to his task in life. He remain-

with Citadel on May 11th. These games,
however, are distinctly pending and not at
all certain. The game with Ronaoke College
