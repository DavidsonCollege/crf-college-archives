DR. PIETENPOL

At the beginning of the present
college year, Dr. Pietenpol was
appointed acting Dean of Faculty,
replacing Dr. C. K. Brown who
resigned at the close of the 1962-
$3 term.

Dr. Pietenpol is a former acting
president of Washington and Jef-
Serson College and has been a
professor of physics at Davidson
since 1946. He organized the school
of engineering at Washington and
Jefferson and served as dean of
faculty there from 1043 to 1046.

In 1943 he was named special
assistant to the president at Wash-
ington and Jefferson and served
in that capacity from 1043-45.

A native of Leota, Minn., he re-
ceived the B. S. degree from the
University of Pittsburgh, master’s
degree from the University of
Colorado, and his Ph. D. from New
York University.

Dr. Pietenpol formerly taught at
the Univérsity of Wisconsin, Yale
University, and Long Island Uni-
versity in addition to his posts at
Washington and Jefferson.

Author of the book, Laboratory
Physics, Dr. Pietenpol is a member
of the American Physical Society,
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, Sigma Chi,
and is listed in “Who's Who in
America” and “American Men of
Science,”

Abernathy.

The purpose of the honor platoon
is to form a superior drill unit,
marching separately and leading

all parades. This newly formed

unit will take its place next to
the regimental commander and re-
view all parades, conducting sepa-
rate close order drill in front of
the regiment.

A total of sixty-two men volun-
teered for the unit, of which
twenty-five were chosen, an extra
three acting as alternates.

Marines to Require
Longer Tour of Duty

All newly enrohed Marine of-
ficer candidates will be required
to serve an extended period of
active duty after being commis-
stoned, according to General
Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., Com-
mandant of the Marine Corps.

Current and future officer re-
quirements of the Marine Corps,
as they are presently indicated,
make desirable longer periods of
active service for all newly com-
missioned reserve officers, General
Shepherd said this week.

The Marine Corps has completed
plans to make certain that a coi-
lege man who enrolls in the Ple-
toon Leaders Class after July 1,
1054, will be required to serve
three years of active commissioned
service, instead of the present two-
year tour.

Officer Candidate Course candi-
dates enrolled subsequent to Feb-
ruary 1, 1084, are subject to this
new policy change now. This new
obligated active duty service does
not apply to OCC and PLC candi-
dates who are currently enrolled
or whose applications are waiting
approval; nor does it apply to re-
serve officers now on active duty.

REFRESHMENTS

Following the EUZKADI concert
Wednesday night there will be a
reception for faculty members and
their wives, and students with
dates. Refreshments will be served
and there will be informal
dancing if desired.

Miller. The agent is Gilbert Gragg.

The President gave a short
speech commending the past presi-
dent, Bob Crutchfield, for a job
well done and pledged to do his
best for this semester.

The program consisted of a
travelog on the Keys in Florida,
followed by a short program by
Gilbert Gragg that received high
praise from the critics.

The President next appointed
two cochaplains, Ken Lewis and
Bob Pulliam; a program commit-
tee, and a secretary and resolu-
tion committee.

ca, where he received his B.A. de-
gree here at Davidson, his M.A.

jack| Conference in San Francisco in
1946.

Two times during his years of
missionary service, Dr. Price saw
China conquered, the second time
by t he Communists in 1960. When
it was no longer possible to carry
on missionary work, Dr. and Mrs.
Price applied for exit permits to
leave the country.

a forceful and dynamic lecturer,
and a translator of note.” He has

Religion and Character in Christian
Middle Schools of Chine, Chine Re-
discovers Her West, We Went to
West China, several translations
of well-known Chinese books, and
other books in Chinese. He de-
livered the Sprunt Lectures at

Assembly’s meeting in Montreat
the past June. Since September of
last year, Dr. Price has been pas-
tor of the New Monmouth Presby-
terian Church near Lexington, Va.

EUZKADI!

a,

Basque Troupe Will
Appear Here Feb. 24

On Wednesday, February 24, at
8:15 p.m., the curtain in Chambers
Auditorium in Davidson will rise
to reveal one of the most amazing
numbers ever offered by the
Artist Series; EUZKADI! This per-
formance by the Basque troupe is
unique in every respect.

What makes EUZKADI different
from all other concert attractions

similation by adhering to a unique
folk culture, different entirely
from all others and charged with
an almost incredible vitality. Their
program is as unusual as the Bas-
que peoples themselves.. All of its
music and dances are combined
into a dramatic whole, ao unfor-
gettable pageant that reveals ‘the
life of the Basques in its varied

is the surging vitality of the} aspects

singing and dancing, the re-crea-
tion in music of the village and
mountain life of the Basques
themselves, and the skillful inter-
play between group and soloists
which permits changes of pace and
mood to proceed without interrup-
tion.

The name of this fascinating
group is the collective term the
Basques use to describe their land,
the land of the “most exciting peo-
ple in the world.” Their homeland
lies both in France and Spain,‘ but
the cry of EUZKADI! reveals a
sturdy love of independence that
has never been quenched. —

The Basques have resisted as-

The Basque dances are different
in every detail and are often char-
acterized by truly astonishing
energy and virility. The singing
of the Basques is marked by a
haunting quality of almost un-
earthly beauty. The costumes and
musical instruments add greatly to
the fascination of EUZKADI! The
performance of Juan Onatibia, di-
rector of the group, upon the
txistu (the Basque flute) is enough
in itself to warrant one’s attend-
ing the program.

Students are admitted to the
unusual attraction of EUZKADI!
upon presentation of their identi-
fication cards.

165 Students Apply
For Scholarships

By JIM BRICE

One hundred sixty-five students
applied for Baker and Union Car-
bide scholarships at Davidson be-
fore the February 1 deadline. Ac-
cording to Dr. Samuel R. Spencer,
this is the largest number of ap-
plications ever received for these
awards.

For the first time, applications
for the two scholarships have been
combined; the applicant states on
the application blank the award
for which he wishes to apply. The
scholarship committee has recent-
ly recommended to the faculty that
the present Baker scholarship com-
mittee be given authority to
choose both the Baker and Union
Carbide scholars for this year.

The committee will begin
processing the applications imme-
diately, and near the end of March
the finalists in the competition
will be brought to Davidson for
final tests and interviews. This
year, approximately twenty-eight
students will come to the campus.
This is larger than the usual num-
ber because of the combining of
the two scholarships.

The Baker awards are made
possible by the George F. Baker
Trust of New York City. Up to six
scholarships are granted each
year to students “who have demon-
strated superior scholastic ability,
high qualities of leadership,

, fraternity nominations.

Marterie and Company will set

‘Jusually somber Chambers Audi-

torium jumping tomorrow after-
noon at three-thirty when the tra-
ditional weekend concert begins.

The IFC-sponsored weekend will
be climaxed tomorrow night with
the informal dance of the two-night
set. The Saturday dance will begin
at eight and end at midnight:

Bandleader Marterie, who has
rocketed to fame in only three
years, will be making his first
appearance at Davidson this week-
end.

A musician's son, Ralph Marterie
was playing professionally at the
age of 14, and at 17 he had settled
down to regular studio work with
the networks in Chicago, playing
with such famed leaders as Paul
Whiteman, Percy Faith, Russ Case,
John Scott Trotter, Frank Black
and others.

During the war, he did a stint
with the Navy, organizing a crew
which. was known as one of the
top service musical units. After
this stint, he returned to radio
work and had his own network
show from Chicago in 1949.

About that time Mercury
Records was seeking a band which
could provide instrumentals which
would prove a hit on long-playing
platters. Marterie contacted Art
Talmadge, official of the Mercury
firm, with some masters he had
cut with a studio crew for his
own amusement. Talmadge was
impressed, and Marterie has been
a Mercury artist since that time.

Getting into the popular band
business meant giving up studio
work which was bringing him
about $1,000 a month. There was
a definite demand for his modern,
clean arrangements with the in-
dividual trumpet flavorings.

Monday Last Chance
For Beauty Entrees

Monday will be the last day for
turning in pictures for the beauty
section of this year's Quips &
Cranks. Freshman members of the
yearbook staff will circulate
through the dormitories between
10:30 and 11:30 on Monday night
to pick up any pictures that were
missed on their previous rounds.

Drinking Rule Defined
By Faculty Committee

According to Dean John C.
Bailey, the faculty rule on drink-
ing is still, for all practical pur-
poses, in a state of transition.

For many years the faculty rul-
ing on drinking hos stated that
students found guilty of drinking
or possessing intoxicating liquors
on or off the campus would be dis-
missed from school.

Dean Baily said the faculty felt
that this rule as stated implied
that the administration presumed
to police the Southeast in order
to uncover violations. Since this
has never been the administration's
intention, he said that the faculty
decided a change in the wording
of the rule would be desirable.

Over a week ago a new rule was
passed and subsequently amended
by the faculty stating in effect
that students found guilty of
drinking, possessing, or being
under the influence of alcoholic
beverages in the town of Davidson

or at any off-campus function in
any way connected with the college
would be suspended from school.

The rule defined off-campus
functions in connection with the
college so as to include most of
the organizations in any way con-
nected with Davidson. Presumably
this Would include such events as
fraternity functions, athletic con-
tests, ete.

This new rule, however, is still
subject to change. The faculty
committee that formulated the
rule and presented it for considera-
tion has since met again and voted
to request that the faculty review
the new rule with the possibility
of rewriting it.

Dean Baily said that he felt
that any drinking rule should make
it clear that the college was not
attempting to escape responsibility
for the off-campus indescretions
of Davidson students, or condon-
ing off-campus drinking.
