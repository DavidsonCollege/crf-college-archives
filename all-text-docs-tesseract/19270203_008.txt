The method of transportation in this
MODERN war is all on the shoulders of
men, and for that purpose they must have
coolies. It is the gentle art of conscrip-
| tion applied in the Chinese way—force. |
|A soldier sallies forth and rounds up all|
the men that he can find—and they do}
get a bunch of poor looking specimens.
This morning the college car that I was
escorting to the city (foreigners being
|the only exempt persons) was held up
|for two hours by a stream of soldiers
land followers. Hundreds of poor cool-
ies, old and young, halt and lame, ragged
and dirty, were carrying ampnunition,
and rice, and guns up to the front. Each
batch of coolies had their guards (cool-
ies themselves), and the latter are none
too gentle. Saw one soldier, about 22
years old, beating one carrier-(about 50)
with a huge bamboo carrying pole. They
don’t take any back-talk when they’ve
got the whip hand, but as soon as the
tide turns against them they are all
“Kamerad.”

Tomorrow we are evacuating all the
women and children, and refugees, and
send them into the city. The men will
stay on and look after the place. Luck-
ily, we have a proclamation from the
general as to our neutrality, and that our
grounds are not to be molested, but with
bullets flying over so promiscously it is
| best that the women be in safer quarters.
There is really not much danger here un-
less these troops are defeated and start
fleeing, in which case everything in their
path will be in danger. All they will’
think of is loot, and in that case the few-
er the women and children around. the
better.

As yet, these troops have not taken
Fuyang. If they do take it, we will prob-
ably be secure for some time. If they do
not, there is no telling what may happen.
Fuyang is a very important point, com-
manding the Chien Dang River, and the
| Northerners will be very hard to dislodge
if they take it.

School

was dismissed on Christmas
Day, and we are not scheduled to start
again till February 16th. At that time we
have to make up the work of the incom-
plete term, examinations, and get in a
full Spring semesters work. Which
means more hours per week in each
class, and less classes for the students. I
hope that we can close the Spring term
on time (if we open at all) for I am
planning to come back to the States this
summer, and want to come via Europe.
If school runs on later than the middle
of June I won’t be able to make the trip
in time to get back for any work in the
Fall. Anyway, when I get back to the
States I am surely planning to come to
Davidson for a visit.

Congratulations on the Championship
Team! Three Davidson men here at
Hangchow (Frank Price, Guy Craig, and
myself) say “Repeat it next year.”
Sincerely,

W. M! Cox, Jr.

An engineer was here last week from
the Southeastern Underwriters Associa-
tion looking over the city water works
and fire-fighting apparatus of the town
so that a recommendation for lower in-
surance rates may be made.

The Davidson Music Club is meeting
Monday.

Murray starred for Davidson. Stetson
University, of Florida, was defeated the
following Wednesday on the local floor,
the final score being 47 to 14. King again
starred with 18 points to his credit.

The preliminary contests for the inter-
collegiate debating teams were held Mon-
day night in the Philanthropic and Eu-
menean Society Halls. The query dis-
cussed was “Resolved, That the employ-
ers and employees of public service cor-
porations should be compelled to settle
their disputes by arbitration.” The fac-
ulty selected four men from each soci-
|ety who will compete in. the finals on
February 12th, when two teams of two
men each will be selected from the
eight contestants. Winners in the Phi
Society were Neal, Ratchford, Thames,

and Webber, with Fowle as alternate;
in the Eu, Bellingrath, Cousar, Eikel,
and Patterson were selected, with Woods
as alternate. |

of the Bureau of Commercial Economics |
of Washington, were shown in Shearer!
Hall on Friday evening, February 2nd, at
6:45. These films were entitled “From'
Cloth to Suit,” and “Trails in the Cana-,
dian Rockies.” Similar pictures will be
shown during the rest of the season.

On last Saturday night the members
of the Winston-Salem Club met and en-
joyed a delightful “feed” in 68 Cham-
bers. Plans were ‘also discussed fof

at Davidson. Seven members were pres-
ent.

Saturday, when the Junior and Sopho-
more teams battled to a scoreless tie.
The game was hard fought throughout,
and proved interesting in many parts.
Both teams threatened to score at sev-
eral stages, but neither developed enough
to make the threat good.

Billy Sayad, all-state football guard,
was elected to the presidency of the Eu-
menean Society at its last meeting.

H. M. Grey, manager of the track
team, has arranged a strong schedule
for the Wildcat track men. Clemson,
N. C., State, Carolina, Trinity, and Wake
Forest have signed contracts for meets
during the coming spring.

The annual Soph banquet was held on
Monday night, February 5, at the Sel-
wyn Hotel in Charlotte. Dr. J. M. Mc-
Connell made a splendid talk on “Loyalty
and Patriotism.” R. O. Harris was
toastmaster for the occasion.

The campus was. shocked to hear of
the death of “Jack” Black’s father on
Sunday February 4th. Dr. Black was a
practicing physician in Cabarrus Coun-
ty, but had a host of friends and ad-
mirers here in Davidson.
