New scholarships encourage international peace studies

By T.K. Tibby

The Dean Rusk Program in
International Studies has an-
nounced that two new scholarships
will be available for study abroad
and special projects this summer.

With the addition of the Ratliff
Endowment in Economics schol-
arship and the Peace Studies grant
the Dean Rusk Program has in-
creased its capacity to fund student
and faculty study abroad.

The Ratliff Endowment was
initiated by economics professor
Clark Ross’ efforts. The endow-
ment fund was created in honor of
Charles Edward Ratliff Jr., a dis-
tinguished Davidson alumnus and
Professor Emeritus of Economics

who has over fifty years of experi-
ence with the college.

Ratliff’s interest in foreign
economics includes having spent
four years teaching in Pakistan.

The Ratliff scholarship will
be awarded to one or more stu-
dents for travel or study grants if
they meet the criteria: financial
need, a willingness to undertake a
project in a Third World or under-
developed country, or to major in
economics or in a project that re-
lates to economics. The endow-
ment may also be used in a joint
student-faculty project or to pay
for a visiting faculty member.

Ratliff has a “particular inter-
est in students that would not oth-
erwise gain experience because of

New Davidson public library
discussed at town meeting

By Russ Tarver
Fewer than twenty were
present as Davidson officials con-
vened to discuss plans for a joint
college, county, and town venture
last Tuesday, March 8, at the
Davidson Town Hall.

The agenda for the town meet-
ing included zoning laws and de-
velopment plans in and around
Davidson and plans for anew town
park.

The big news of the meeting
was the official announcement of
the ground-breaking for a new
county library in July. The county
is cooperating with the town and
Davidson College to build the new
library.

‘Mayor Russell B. Knox ex-
pressed his dismay about the poor
attendance, saying, “Unfortu-
nately, unless you’ve got some-
thing controversial, people don’t
come [to town meetings]. I’d like
to see more participation from the

Davidson for which he has pro-
vided key leadership.

Kuykendall says, “Stuart
Dickson has worked tirelessly for
Davidson, and I think the decision
to honor him in this way is simply
marvelous.”

Dean of Faculty Robert Wil-
liams says a professorship of this
magnitude is a compliment to the
quality of Davidson’s faculty.

Williams said, “The student-
teacher relationship remains the
binding thread in the fabric of the
college. The Dickson Professor-
ship will not only recognize fac-
ulty members who excel in foster-
ing these relationships, but it will
also serve as a permaneni tribute to
one of Davidson’s most avid sup-
porters.”

community at large, as well as from
the student body.”

Knox stressed the importance
of good relations between
Davidson College and itssurround-
ing residential areas. He says that
thus far the relationship has been
“outstanding.”

Knox said, “It has never hap-
pened before in Mecklenburg
County that a college owns the
land and the county runs the li-
brary, while the town puts up the
money to get the building built."

The new library will be lo-
cated on land owned by Davidson
College on Main Street across from
the town shops.

‘Mecklenburg County will re-
pay the town of Davidson for the
money it puts up for the land
through lease payments. Knox
described the town-county ar-
rangementas “very innovative and
a rallying point to unite the com-
munity.”

the small library currently situated
at the end of South Main and, at
6,000 square feet, will be 3 to 4
times larger than its predecessor.

financial constraints.” For that rea-
son, those students who demon-
strate financial need are more fa-
vorably considered for this schol-
arship, even though financial need
is not required.

The Peace Studies grant was
created through the efforts of Dean
Robert Williams and will be funded
by an anonymous donor couple
who, according to Williams, “are
committed to peace studies.” Both
students and faculty members have
expressed an interest in peace stud-
ies, and currently one faculty mem-
ber, Ken Menkhaus, is in Somalia.

The grant will distribute ap-
proximately $10,000 each year for
the next five years. The money
will be divided between students

and faculty to support peace stud-
ies at Davidson College.

Unlike the requirements for
the Ratliff Endowment, there is no
set criteria for this grant. Since this
is the first year for the endowment,
Williams and Perry do not want to
limit the type of projects that may
be considered for funding. Wvill-
iams stated that the grants could be
awarded to students who want to
attend conferences or take part in
courses or seminars that relate to
peace studies. Students wishing to
undertake individual study projects
(relating to peace studies) in the
United States or abroad can also
consider applying.

"Aging and

Hall counselors head to the hills

By Jeff Kent
This weekend, the 34 sopho-
mores chosen to be freshmen hall
counselors for the next school year

. travelled to the Blue Ridge Moun-

tains for the annual hall counselor
retreat.

The group stayed at the Blue
Ridge Association Conference
Center where they performed ac-
tivities and played games to create
group unity and get to know each
other.

John Murchison, one of the

new freshman advisors, helped
organize the retreat and says the
trip was a “time for everyone to get
away from Davidson and bond as a
group.”

Murchison also says that the
retreat served as a time for the 34
sophomores to learn to live and
work together.

Since the new hall counselors
will pick their roommates in a few
weeks, this experience will help
them settle on a few choices for
their roommates next year.

tending special seminars such as
conflict-resolution would also be
awarded. Other proposals relating
to peace studies would qualify.

Perry credits Ross and Will-
iams for their efforts in getting
these scholarships started. Will-
iams is very pleased with the new
scholarships.

Williams reminds students
that these scholarships are simply
an addition to the funding that is
already available through the Dean
Rusk Program. Students are en-
couraged to continue applying for
the other study or travel grants and
scholarships available through the
Dean Rusk Program.

Attention: Not all condoms cre-
ated equal

TOPANGA, CALIF. (CPS)—Us-
ing a condom during sex doesn’t
necessarily mean you and your
partner will be protected from dis-
ease, according to recent studies.

Tests of 20,000 condoms
show important differences
among various brands in protec-
tion from sexually transmitted
disease, including AIDS, said the
Mariposa Foundation, which con-
ducts independent research on
human sexuality and sexually
transmitted diseases.

“Currently, consumers in the
U.S. can obtain more information
and data about the performance
of a refrigerator than they can
about a condom,” the foundation
said in a news release.

Mariposa recently conducted
a second testing of condoms to
test viral leakage as a follow-up
to an earlier study sponsored by
the foundation, the University of

California-Los Angeles and the
University of Southern Califor-
nia.

In the first study, 31 kinds of
condoms were tested to see which
afforded the greatest protection
against STDs and HIV-1. The
brands that provided the greatest
protection were Mentor (which is
no longer being sold), Ramses
Non-Lube, Rameses Sensitol,
Gold Circle Coin, Gold Circle
and Sheik Elite. The brands show-
ing the highest leakage were
Contracept Plus, which came in
at 31st, Trojan Ribbed (30th),
Trojan Naturalube Ribbed (29th)
and LifeStyles Nuda (28th).

About 20,000 condoms were
used in the first test, which mea-
sured how susceptible latex con-
doms were to leakage of viral
fluid after simulating the stress of
sex for five minutes on a coital
simulator. About 1,000 condoms
were used in the follow-up test.
