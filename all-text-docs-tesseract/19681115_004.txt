COMMITTEE _ URGES FIVE-YEAR PLAN |
Davidson: ‘A Hiding Place From Society’s Frustrations’

ED. NOTE: The following is the
final draft of the preliminary re-
port drawn up by the Five-Year
Plan Committee. If will be present-
ed initially to the President’s Com-
mission on Extra-Campus Respon-
sibilities.

The Five-Year Plan Committee be
gan its research with several assump-
tions. One of these was that there is a
need for Davidson to acquire a more

diverse student body. The student body.

as it is now constituted is so over-
whelmingly white. Protestant. South-
ern, and upper middle class that the
few students here who do not fit in
that category are alienated from their
peers and prevented from making a
significant contribution to the °.fe of the
College.

The lack of a substantial number of
students from different American socio-
economic groups hinders the education-
al process.

Student life is a far more educative
experience than academic life. There
is a need for a greater number of
diverse groups to generate a better
educational experience for all Davidson
students.

It is now possible for a student to
graduate from Davidson without
having been exposed to ideas and
emotions representative of a large
segment of American people. Be-
cause Davidson does not have the
flexibility of a large university in
this area it needs to make a special
effort to get a diversified student
body.

Another assumption was that there
is a need to educate, and educate well,
a group of Americans who until recent-
ly have been almost wholly denied the
opportunity to attend colleges with high
academic standing.

These are the low-income and minori-
ty-group students who because of social
and educational environment have not
achieved sufficiently im secondary
schoo! to enter a college like Davidson.
The current concern in the United
States about these groups is long over-
due, and what happens to them in the
near future will have a significant im-
pact on America.

Students from these groups could
benefit from the Davidson exper-
lence, and Davidson would benefit
from their presence in the student
body. Few such students are now
belng admitted.

Davidson did not degin admitting
Negroes until it became fashionable.
and only two alumni are American
Negroes. A few students from low-
income and minority groups each year
wilt not significantly improve the
character of the student body.

CHRISTIAN COMMITMENT

In order to maintain and expand
whatever leadership role Davidson has
in Southern education and in the na-
tion in general, the college needs to
find dynamic and creative ways to
educate diverse types of people. David-
son is geared to one type of student and
its effectiveness and influence are
limited to what it can do with that
student.

The Christian commitment. so often
touted at Davidson is not served by a
lack of concern for social problems and
for persons outside the average Da-
vidsonian’s social milieu.

This commitment, if it is to exist
in substance, calls the college to
explore the problems in this area
and to act on them to the best of
its ability.

Davidson must {not remain securely
insulated in academic sanctuary, ignor-
ing what is happening around it.

Given these considerations, the
Five-Year Plan Committee feels
that Davidson College should instl-
tute a major program with the
goals of educating a significant
number of low-income and minorlty-
group persons and providing a more
diverse studen! body to improve the
Davidson educational experience.
The education of these minority group

students should provide them with the
skills necessary for constructive lead-
ership in the South and throughout the
nation. which they will almost assured-
ly be called upon to exercise in the
years ahead.

These students will wield much more
influence in the years immediately fol-
lowing their graduation than the aver-
age Davidson student.

To a certain extent the future of
American society depends on the crea-
tive capacities of all its citizens. Those
groups that because of complex factors
of national historical development have
been stifled for so long must be given
the opportunity to move. to explore.
and to create in the same ways that the
present Davidson student does in rela.
tion to his society.

Certain advantages are necessary to
offset the disadvantages members of
these groups have suffered, and the
college should assume its fair share in
providing them.

Special programs to educate iow-
Income and minority group students
are now In progress at a number
of the bes? Institutions, and Da-
vidson cannot afford to Ignore this
clear and present need.

A program admitting a substantiat
number of such students would better
educate all students at Davidson. If
Davidson is a mirror of society, as is
sometimes claimed. then a_ careful
selection of members of minority groups
in our society would improve the edu-
cational process.

Student life is a vital part of educa-
tion, and the opportunity to gain from
a stimulating section of students must
be taken.

After graduation current Davidson
students will have to deal with a
number of social problems. That
they should graduate uninformed
and untersched by major sreas of
national and personal concern is
inexcusable.

The reality of these social problems
and the necessity of dealing with them
would be fostered by personal acquain
tance with persons who were familiar
with these problems.

HIDING PLACE

Davidson cannot legitimately function
as a hiding place from the frustrations
and failures of society and send its
graduates out to a world less sheltered
than dormitory row and athletic. events.
The college needs to inform its students
of contemporary problems.

The first step in developing a
program that would satisfy these
goals would be selecting a group
of low-income and minority-group
students who are clearly inetigible
by present standards.

These students would be selected on
the basis of personal qualities and
characteristics with little weight given
to standardized test scores and grades.

Wesleyan University, in its 1968 re-
port to the Rockefeller Foundation on
its five-year program, states that “the
main factor in the success of a minor-
ity-group student is his overall per-
sonal strength.”

Cornell University has found that
there is no significant correlation be-
tween disadvantaged students’ Scholas-
tic Aptitude Test scores and their
academic records at the university.

Current admissions standards mea-
sure past achievements rather than
future potential. This places direct and
arbitrary barriers in the way of the
disadvantaged student.

Rather than following. normal ad-
missions criteria, cofleges having
five-year programs have selected
their disadvantaged students on the
basts of qualities such as intellec-
tual and emotional toughness, cour-
age, imagination and realism.
Grades and test scores do not mea-

sure the future potential of such stu-
dents since their poor secondary school
achievement is caused by cultural de-
ficiencies.

Harvard’s ‘‘Risk-Gamble’’ program
seeks “impressive young men from
severely disadvantaged backgrounds
who have done so far with their lives
all that could reasonably have been
asked of them." according to the Com-
mittee on Scholarships and Admissions.
These students score an average of
400 or better on the College Board
SAT’s. ;

Since one of the goals of this program
would be to get students outside of
the traditional Davidson mold, it fol-
lows that they will not even approxi-
mate present admissions standards.

It can be assumed that since middle-
class parents are aware of the value
of a college education and encourage
their children to seek it, the five-year
program will seek students who do not
realize the benefits of college, but who
nevertheless have a desire to achieve.

ALTERNATE STANDARDS
-This will require finding these stu-
dents, informing them about the pro-
gram, and convincing them to come
to Davidson. These students have life
styles divergent from middle class
standards.

In most cases they have had little
exposure to books and other cultural
advantages.

Because of these cultural de-
flciencies and divergencies, low-
income and minority-group students
do not perform well on standardized
fests that are oriented to the middle
class and reflect middie class ex-
perience. These tests are not mean-
ingful for disadvantaged students.
Median SAT scores for disadvantaged

students entering Cornell in 1967 were
about 175 points below the median for
all entering freshmen, but very few
drop out for academic reasons.

Analysis showed no significant cor.’
relation between their SAT scores and
their academic records while at Cor-
nell.

Primary admissions criteria ‘or
these students at Cornell were recom.
mendations, evidence of earnestness of
purpose. and evaluation in the context
of the high school attended.

The Antioch Program for Interracial
Education seeks students possessing a
number of qualities. including courage,
realism, imagination. skill in communi-
cation, tenacity, toughness, openness,
ability to encounter new experiences,
leadership ability and confidence.

These appear to be more important
to success in college than academic
achievement as determined by past
performance. Students possessing these
characteristice require only an oppor-
tunity for success.

RECRUITING

Many colleges having disadvan-
taged-student programs fee! that
early recruitment is a primary
factor in the success of the selec-
tion process.

Harvard begins recruiting students
evén back to the junior high schoo! and
elementary levels. A number of organi-
zations provide information about
talented disadvantaged students and
serve as clearing houses for those
wanting to go to college.

These include the National Scholar-
ship Service and Fund for Negro Stu-
dents. the Upward Bound program.
the Independent Schools Talent Search
and others.

A Better Chance (ABC) at Dartmouth
recruits high school students in the
tenth grade for special summer pro-
grams at Dartmouth and then sends
them to prep schools and good public
high schools during the year.

Cornell has students referred
through the Cooperative Program
for Educational Opportunity, the
National Achievement Scholarship
Program, and Aspira, a Puerto
Rican organization.

Another possible selection method is
through selector groups. This appears
to be the most effective recruitment
technique. now in use.

As utilized: in the Antioch program,
selector groups are set up in four
communities which are
Antioch.

Members of the selector group
include clergymen, social workers,
high school counselors, and teach-
ers. Not all students recommended
by the selector group can be accept-
ed by the college, and It Is the re-
sponsibility of the selector group to
help those not chosen to find a use-
ful post-high school experience.

The selector group functions as an
adjunct of the admissions office and as
a guidance and counseling service.

A further source of information about
prospective five-year students could
be Davidson alumni who are now minis-
ters and teachers.

There are several methods of orient-
ing disadvantaged students to the col-
lege and of devising means to solve
their specific educational and cultural
deficiencies. ‘

An orientation period during the lat-
ter part of the summer can include
administration of placement tests and
compensatory short-term courses in
some areas.

EXPANSION

lt would be necessary for David-
son to admit a fairly large number
of disadvantaged students in order
to prevent the feelings of defeat
and frustration that Negro students
ow experience at Davidson.
Admission of approximately 30

low-income and minority-groaup students
each year would enable these students
to draw strength from the group and
not suffer the common experience of
Negro students now at Davidson.

Because of the present composition
of the student body. it is difficult if
not impossible for black students to
avoid a sense of alienation.

A large group of disadvantaged stu-
dents on campus would gain reinforce-
ment from the group and not acquire
feelings of loneliness and self-conscious-
ness.

Therefore, about 30 students per year,
a total of 150 after five years, would be
a number large enough to solve this
problem and to provide a significant
attack on the problem of education of
low-income and minority groups.

At the institutions which now have
five-year programs, competent coun-
seling Has been crucial to the success
of the program.

Counselors would be needed who
could understand the emotional
probiems of disadvantaged students
in’ an unfamiltar environment.
These counselors would be con-
cerned with academic, social, and
emotional adjustments. The aca-
demic progress of each students
would be evaluated individually.
Tutoring by other students is consid-

ered vital to the success of the dis-
advantaged students. They may, how-
ever, resent having tutors forced on
them. and it is best to have them
choose their own tutors from students
they trust.

REMEDIAL COURSES

Rather than having disadvantaged
students take remedial courses which
may make them feel set apart from
the rest of the student body, they should
be allowed to take a lighter course
load. ;

Tutoring can be arranged to provide
necessary background in a course, and
summer work through remedial tech-
niques can sharpen language skills and
improve mathematical background,

It is important not to make the dis-
advantaged students feel academically
inferior by having them take remedial
courses for one year. If remedial
classes prove to be necsesary, they
should be small and individualized.

There should be plenty. of informal
personal guidance.

Wesleyan in its report to the Rocke-
feller Foundation pointed out that after

related to:

fits crash program in the summer,
14 of 21 students were able to
begin taking regular English
courses, the very area in which they
were expected to have the most diffi-
culty.

At Antioch the transition to the stu-
dent sub-culture and the world of aca-
demia was aided by the fact that all
Antioch students receive no grades dur-
ing their first year. .

The academic performance and
achievement of disadvantaged stu-
dents were evatuated individually
by faculty members, thus enabling
students to make the transition un-
der less pressure.

Harvard utilizes counseling by grad-
uate students living in the dormitories
and special tutors if needed.

City College of New York offers
special remedial courses which meet
more hours per week than regular
courses. Wisconsin provides extensive
tutoring with a graduate student su-
pervising tutors and making progress
reports.

Dartmouth has a two-month summer
program to help students adjust to the

change in community and cultural at-.

titudes and to the academic situation.

Complete counseling and tutoring
for a group of disadvantaged stu-
dents at Davidson would demand
the addition of administrative,
counseling and psychiatric services.

Also Negro faculty members and
counselors from low-income and minori-
ty groups with whom the students
could identify would be necessary.

A CERTAIN HOSTILITY
Most colleges with disddvantaged

student programs report that these
students experience a degree of group
feeling and a certain hostility until
they begin to realize the humanness of
the regular middle class students and
until a period of mutual adjustment
occurs.

Many of these colleges have be-
gun offering courses In areas such
as Negro history and f(iterature
which disadvantaged students are
interested in.

These students are also encouraged
to participate in extra-curricular acti.
vities to aid the adjustment process
Student-faculty discussion groups,
seminars, and plays ‘of special interest
are presented by and for disadvantaged
students. .

The academic achievements of dis-
advantaged students in colleges thal
have designed special programs for
them have been little short of over.
whelming. The rate of attrition has
been low in practically every case.

At Cornell in 1965 three out. of 37 dis-
advantaged students dropped out for
academic reasons and two of 46 in 1969.

Cornell has reported that “even
this small sample encourages the
belief that the percent of academic
failure among these students will
be small and probably will not ex-
ceed that of the student body as a
whole.”

Few have left for any reason—30 of
37 in the class of 1969 and 40 of 46 in
the class of 1970 remain.

At the University of Wisconsin 76 of
79 disadvantaged students enrolled in
1967 returned for their second year.

Harvard expects approximately
75 percent of its “Risk-Gamble”’
plan students to graduate as com-
pared to 90 percent of normal Har-
vard students.

Disadvantaged students are .capable
of succeeding in a culture and environ-
ment very different from their own.
Not only do they benefit from the col-
lege experience but the low-income and
minority group students also contribute
noticeably to the learning process of
the college as a whole.

The addition of courses geared to
meet the needs of disadvantaged stu-

dents has drawn the attention and in-
terest of regular student bedy mem-
bers,

At Wesleyan, students taking such
courses come .to realize the contribu-
tions to and influence upon American
society which low-income and minority
groups have had.

In addition the often-protected
children of suburbia gain an appre-
clation for and interest in contem-
porary social problems which they
will face in the near future. This
seems to be an invaluable approach
to finding solutions to these vitat
questions.

As an outgrowth of classes. seminars
and openend discussions started by
disadvantaged students at Antioch.
reguitr students become more appre-
ciative of the worth of all peoples.

When the barriers of mistrust and
suspicion fall away, both disadvantaged
and regular students realize that they
mutually benefit from the humanness
of social interaction. Both learn ideas
and attitudes which they will take with
them outside the college community.

Thus, in addition to creating an
awareness among al! students, dis-
advantaged students learn that mid-
dle-class whites can come to under-
stand them and to use that under-
standing in future life experiences.
So it is that disadvantaged students
affect the colleges they attend and
the society at targe.

John C. Hoy, dean of admissions at
Wesleyan, commented, “In the next
10 to 15 years, this group of alumai
(the disadvantaged) is going to make
a contribution to our society that will
be far out of proportion to the average
Wesleyan graduates’s impact.”

The benefits both to the educational
process at Davidson College and to so-
ciety would more than offset the ex-
penditure of energy and resources
necessitated by a five-year program.

Colleges having disadvantaged-stu-
dent programs have funded them pri-
marily through large gifts from foun:
dations and individuals.

The Ford and Rockefeller foundations
have made large grants to Wesleyan,
Cornell and Antioch, and a number of
smaller foundations have contributed
to the planning and maintenance of
disadvantaged-student programs at all
the colleges having them.

FINANCING

Several colleges have received large
grants under the Higher Education Act.
and most of the colleges participate in
the National Defense Education Act
Student Loan program.

Office of Economic Opportunity legis-
lation provides some funds for such
areas as work-study jobs.

Antioch reports that over 40 corpora
tions have made contributions, ranging
in amounts up to $20,000.

it is difficult to determine what
the cost of such a program would
be at Davidson. There are a num-
ber of different alternatives in the
actual structure of the proposed
disadvantaged-s tudent program
and the cost and method of fund-
ing would depend on the alterna-
tives adopted.

The major alternatives appear to be
either providing one year of remedial
work and four years of regular course
work, a five-year reduced course-load
plan, or a_ strictly-summer program
such as Project ABC at Dartmouth.

A summer program could easily be
devised that would be compatible with
a five-year program.

The summer program by itself, how-
ever, offers no benefits to the regular
educational program of the college.
Therefore it would seem reasonable to
establish a summer program only in
conjunction with a five-year program.

Alternative admissions methods to
implement the five-year program in-
clude decreasing the number of regular
students now entering to make room
for the disadvantaged students or in-
creasing the size of the student body.

STUDENT BODY SIZE

It {s necessary to matriculate approxi-
mately 30 disadvantaged students per
year in order to mount a significant
attack on the problem and provide a
large-enough number so that the Jow-
income and minority-group students
will not be alienated and frustrated by
the atmosphere of Davidson.

This would require more faculty
members who could help these students
with adjustment problems.

A mixture of disadvantaged stu-
dents for a program at Davidson
might include Negroes, poor whites,
those from both rural and urban
ghettos, and those from various
ethnic groups, such as Puerto
Ricans and American Indians.

Over five years this would increase
the student body by 150. This would
require new dormitory space and pother
facilities.

It seems preferable to increase the
size of the student body rather than
decrease the number of regular stu-
dents Davidson now admits.

As institutions already having disad-
vantaged student programs have
pointed out, such a program does not
compromise the educational quality of
the college but is rather an enrich-
ment of it.

BENEFITS

The benefits to colleges that have
disadvantaged student programs have
been great.

Cornell attributes to its disadvantaged
student program ‘‘a marked increase:
in the variety and richness of student
life... . For the first time a very
important part of our population is
making a major contribution to the
intellectual and social environment of
the university.”

City College of New York calls it
“the fulfillment of the college's moral
and educational responsibility.”

‘Mr. Hoy of Wesleyan calls the
achievements of Wesleyan's students
“extraordinary” and says that ‘‘the
morale and attitude of the Negro stu-
dents themselves are the primary
Strength and justification for the pro...
gram.”

Jewel Graham, director of Antioch’s
program, says that “probably the most
positive impact on the community is
that people from different backgrounds
become real—to be dealt with on an
equal basis—not as inferiors or super-
iors. not as ghetto children to tutor or
to be tutored, not as poor Negroes to be
helped or whites to be tolerated; not
as the household help to do menial work
or employers of household help, but as
fellow students—peers.’*

Davidson should not deny the
benefits that « disadvantaged stu-
dent program would have for both
the college and the society of
which it is a part.

There is an opportunty for Davidson
to make a major contribution to edu-
cation and to society which it would be
selfish and unrealistic to neglect. The
difficulties involved can be overcome.

Davidson can commit itself to total
and impartial education of the whole
man, or Davidson can continue to turn
away and insulate itself from social
problems.

We believe that the good of society
and the educational program at David-
son would best be served by the institu-
tin of a five-year program for students
from low-income and minority groups.
