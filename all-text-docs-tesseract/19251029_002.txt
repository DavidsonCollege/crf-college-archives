The Davidson varsity tennis team de-
feated the representatives of the Char-
lotte Country Club on last Friday by the
overwhelming score of 6 to 1. The
matches were played on the elegant
courts of the Charlotte Country Club,
and a large audience witnessed the
games. The courts were in excellent
shape, and presented quite a contrast to
what the Davidson boys were accustomed
to play on.

The outstanding stars of the contest
were the two rival captains, Tommy
Hawkins of Charlotte and Leighton Mc-
Cutcheon of Davidson. The game played
by Dick Carr was worthy of special men-
tion also.

Davidson took all but one of the
matches, captain McCutcheon losing to
Captain Hawkins by a score of 6-3, 2-6,
6-1. This match was a_neck-in-neck
struggle, in which Hawkins finally man-
aged to win out. Dick Carr beat his op-
-ponent by a score of 6-0, 6-2, It was evi-
dent from the beginning that Carr would

In the double matches Davidson was
also victorious. The two dubles teams of
Davidson were composed of Brown and
Lockhart, and McCutcheon and Carr.
The latter team had a close match, but
finally emerged with the big end of the
score, In this match the playing of Dick
Carr was well-night sensational. He
played a beautiful driving and net game,
and was undoubtedly the star of this
match.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

| Fight ’em, Wildcats; fight ’em!

| —EE

| This afternoon decides whether the
Wildcats shall battle Carolina as a con-
tender forthe state championship, or
whether they will meet the Tar Heels
|in a contest that has no bearing on the
| state title.

| _The thousands of people who are watching
| the little red and black jersey-clad boys fight
for Davidson are going to watch a deter-
mined and dogged fight on the part of Da-
| vidson.

| Not only are the Wildcats fighting to-
day under the harboring wings of their
own dormitories, but they are on their
| own grounds, which gives them a decided
| advantage.

When the whistle blows eleven snarl-
ing Wildcats will be waiting to scrap and
claw their way through the heavy State
team, with many more of the same va-
riety purring on the sidelines, anxious to
get into the game.

But, we cannot forget that in front of
these eleven Wildcats and eleven hefty
players, and before the Wildcats can make
much progress, seven of these big boys
will be shoved aside by such men the
size of Tom Baker and Harry Vance It
has been done, though, and whether de-
feated or victorious today,, these eleven
forwards of Davidson are going to show
their mettle.

They haven't forgotten the 10-10 tie at
Pinehurst last year. Will today’s fracas be
a duplicate, or which team is going to win?

Most sport scribes over the state seem
to think that Davidson will win on the
basis of past performances of both teams
this season. But we are taking such
predictions with a grain of salt.

As your writer said last Saturday, “I
don’t like to make predictions about Da-
vidson; you never can tell what she is
going to do.”

It is interesting to note outsiders ob-
servations sometimes One sports writer
in his comments Monday said: “The Da-
vidson-Furman game at Charlotte Satur-
day left the following distinct impres-
sions: The Purple Hurricane has the
strongest line in the Carolinas; Vance,
of the Wildcats, is one of the greatest
forwards in the South; the Davidson
fighting tradition was amply held up; and
the “crazy quilt” formation is a beautiful

Piece of press-agenting.” To all that we
agree.

All the Wildcats could hope for last Sat-
urday, even though they gave their best, was
an even break against Furman, but State
bapers seemed to be expecting the little
Presbyterians to win. For instance, one pa-
ber stated that “Davidson’s defeat-was rather
discouraging to North Carolina football en-
thusiasts.. It was a hard game to lose. Da-
vidson, along with Wake Forest, is the best
North Carolina has.” We appreciate the lat-
ter, and today is deciding just how good
Davidson is. We sincerely hope that writer

| will not be disappointed at the end of the
Season.

match of the fall, and a fine schedule is
now being arranged for next spring by
Captain McCutcheon.

total gain of 65 yards over Davidson. |
The Furman backs were thrown for |
heavy losses which counteracted their |
gain from scrimmage as will be seen |
from the following: |
