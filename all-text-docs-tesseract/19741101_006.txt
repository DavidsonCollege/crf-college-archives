Without seeking in any way to downgrade the quality of
Southern cookery, it remains a fact that a displaced Mid-
westerner will usually drool in vain in his search for the legen-
. dary hofbrau haus south of the border. But alas, he need look no
further than the Rheinland Haus, a quaint retreat located in-
congrously in a shopping center on Charlotte’s Park Road.

And in keeping with the spirit, October is Oktoberfest mon
at the Rheinland Haus, conjuring up visions of that ial
celebration (and of Lowenbrau, Dortmunder, et al) up Nawth.

But the subdued atmosphere here is no comparison with the
wild revelry connected with the real thing, and maybe that’s
just as well. ‘

But if you like German or Kosher food, this is the place to find
it. The menu is not expansive (even a little disappointing), being
comprised mostly of sandwiches, but the fare is reasonably
priced.

Sauerbraten, the ‘‘prime” offering to a native gourmand, is
priced at $2.75, which includes ample servings of sauerkraut,
German potato salad, baked beans, and pumpernickel bread,
the quality of which all passed our rigorous inspection.

Desert specialties include the favorite apple streudel and
cheese cake, both superb.

Of course, no German feast is complete without resorting to
the trademarks of the native diet: sausage, cheese, and beer,
not necessarily in that order. The former two are offered as part
of an hors d’oeuvre tray priced at $3.50, and smothered in suc-
culent sauerkraut. \:

As for the beer, (the quality of which was substantially at-
tested to by a coterie of nuns who frequently happen to show up
at the same time we do), we must admit rather sheepishly to
having been denied its pleasures, for reasons known only to the
Rheinland Haus and the state of North Carolina.

It seems that the state which made brown bagging famous has
also ordained that legal age may be established at the whim of
individual restaurants, which in the case of the Rheinland Haus
has been set at 20. Maybe that’s their way of reflecting on the
potency of the house specialty (Lowenbrau), but lest you accept
that theory remember that their policy includes Schlitz, also.

. Anyways, swallowing our pride and repressing our thirst, we
settled for ice tea, which is at least cold, wet, and considerably
cheaper.

The Bavarian decor of the surroundings is complete down to
the organ, juke box, and walls lavishly decorated with or-
namental beer steins. It is dark, (and therefore rather roman-
tic), meaning that the party in the corner is subject to being
forgotten by the waitress, an occurrence either upsetting or con-
venient depending on the circumstances. i

The dining room is also supplied with a television set, provid-
ing an excellent environment for enjoying the Kentucky Derby,
World Series, or Game of the Week, while munching on the hors
d’oeuvres and sipping the brew. Who knows, someday they may
even provide their patrons with the melodic strains of the oom-
pa-pa. :

So, even if you’re not yet 20, (or don’t like beer anyways),
dining at the Rheinland Haus is a pleasant and relaxing respite
from the rigors of Davidson.

A Review
By FRANCIS TOWNSEND
Staff Writer

The ripples of laughter
which could be heard from
time to time echoing from
within Hodson Hall constitute
only one reason why the
Davidson Drama _depart-
ment’s first major production
of the year, ‘‘The Servant of
Two Masters,’’ should be
rated a fair success.

The play is a comedy per-
formed in the style of an
Italian genre which emerged
during the Sixteenth Century.
This genre, the commedia
dell’ arte, is composed of a
group of plays which utilized
conventions such as type
characters (usually masked)
and type scenes, and were per-
formed by groups of traveling
actors on small outdoor stages

set up in villages. Much of the
dialogue was improvised, and
an atmosphere of relaxed in-
formality pervaded the per-

formances.

Goldini’s ‘‘Servant of Two:

Masters” differs from these
traditional comedies in that
his play was written during
the eighteenth century when
the true commedia dell’ arte
was fast disappearing.

As a result, The Servant of
Two Masters may be read
with a complete script, unlike
its extemporaneous
predecessors. One of the
inherent difficulties of the
play is that Goldini attempts
to preserve in a script the
flavor of a dramatic genre
normally filled with ad-libbing
and improvisation. The cast
performing the play is
likewise beset with the prob-
lem that they too must at-

! on the new album then, is very similar
! to that on the previous one, though the

musical unit.

With voice lessons behind him,
Browne’s vocals are stronger and more
expressive than ever.

An analysis of the lyrics on ‘‘Late for
the Sky’’ reveals that the author con-
tinues to explore the themes of love and
j illusion (which have «preoccupied his
; thoughts on earlier albums) and that he

one you love).

In ‘Fountain of Sorrow” Browne
makes it clear that his sorrow over his
shattered illusions is but a part of the
general sorrow-in his life. He implies
that the fountain of sorrow (or of
loneliness and despair) becomes the
fountain of life if (as he admits has been
the-case in his own past) he is unable to
sustain a loving relationship with
people in this existence.

In “‘The Late Show” Browne, in in-
creasingly desperate terms, em-

phasizes his fears. In the first three '

verses he speaks repeatedly of his
loneliness which is due in part to
people’s coldness toward one another
(Maybe people only ask you how you’re
doing/’Cause that’s easier than letting
on how little they could really care).

In the fourth verse he says he’s sick
and tired of “‘all this circling/And glim-
pses of the end” and he constructs an
appealing fantasy image that could

save him from his emptiness and:

despair.
“‘Look,”’ he says:

it’s like you're standing in the
window of a house nobody lives
in,
And I'm sitting in a car across the
way.
Let’s just say--
“it’s an early model Chevrolet,
Let's just say--
it’s a warm and windy day.
You go and pack your sorrows
Trashman comes tomorrow
Leave it at the curb, and we will
just go away.

It’s the Scene pictured on the cover of
the album, adapted from Rene Magrit-
te’s surrealistic painting entitled “Em-

gathering up ahead,” bnd adds,
“They’re gouna wash this planet clean
like the Bible said.”
, And finally, he warns, ‘‘Dpn’t think it
won’t happen just because it}hasn’t hap-
pened yet.” His doubts and fears lead
inevitably to a vision of an apocalypse.

“The Road and the Sky? is a well
executed rock ’n’ roll tune, straight and
simple. If its fast rhythm pnd steady
beat are distracting, they stand in
direct contrast to the subtle piano by
Larry Zack and violin by David Lindley
accompaniment on the following cut,
“For a Dancer.”

In terms of poetry and theme, this
song stands above all others on ‘“‘Late
for the Sky.”’

The song begins with a description of
another particular love affair which
has faded in the night (I don’t remem-
ber losing track of you/You were
always dancing in and out of view/I
must have thought that you would
always be around).

He then speaks of the general con-
of his particular failures and

uncertainties, and again these con-
sequences take on apocalyptic propor-
tions. Employing the sky imagery
again, he urges that we not ignore the
situation at hand: '

Keep a fire burning in your €y¢
And pay attention to the open sky
