DAVIDSON SPORTS

Wed., Mar. 22, 1939

Yes, sir! It certainly looks as if Spring is here, and with it naturally
comes baseball, track, golf, and tennis, and possibly even thoughts of
summer and freedom, Baseball is drawing the spotlight right at the
present, not only on our campus but also in the sport pages of the
country round. The big league teams are getting warmed up for the
coming campaign, and it won't be long before they will be in full
swing. The most disappointing thing about this season is the lack of
holdouts . . . even Dean, Di Maggio, and Van Mungo are in the fold.
The managers must have had something up their sleeves to get all the
boys in the first go-round.

We see that the Yankees have started their winning ways already
by edging out the Cards a couple of times. They look stronger than
ever with a rookie outfielder that is slated to take the right field post
away from George Selkirk. However, they may face some unexpected
oppostion from either Detroit or Cleveland which have potentially
great teams. One of the many teams to watch in the National League
is this Cincinnatti team ... all young boys, but extremely dangerous.
But don’t count-the “Jints” out by a long shot.

Pete Whittle had his first view of his proteges in action last Satur-
day when the Varsity engaged in a practice meet with the Freshmen.
The team showed up fairly well for this early in the season, but it is
very evident that we will be woefully weak in several departments. A
jump of 5 ft. 7 in. will not, win very many meets, nor will a 55 second
440. Then the Varsity only got a third place in two events—the discus
and the 220 low hurdles. However, very surprising was the perform-
ance turned in by a Sophomore, Jack White, in the running of the 100
in 10.3 and the 220 in 23.5. Whittle may have a find there, if White
continues to improve as he has lately.

The team will miss Bailey Williams and “Cruper” Crisp in the
weights, because it does not have an outstanding discus hurler or
shot putter. Swede Johnson is again having trouble with that arm that
bothered him last year, and unless it improves some it is apparent
that he will not be able to throw the javelin up to the 200 ft. mark
that he has been aiming at for three years.

While most of the Davidson students are blissfully enjoying the
needed holidays of this week-end the tennis and golf teams will be
representing the school and having a good time meeting teams in the
South and Southwest. The net men are journeying all the way to Texas
to engage several teams out there, and the whole student body is behind
them as they go out, We are proud of our tennis team and the record
that it is making, for although we cari not compete with the tremendous
schools in some sports because of enrollment and finances we can meet
them on the tennis court and golf links on even terms. The racqueteers
defeated the Myers Park Country Club Saturday 3-2, but the interesting
match of the day was when Billy Turner, playing number one, defeated
Teddy Burwell, the North Carolina champion -for a number of years
straight.

The Golf team is also going galavanting around the Southern States
in quest of wins on different courses around the country. Jimmy Cooper,
playing superb golf, is playing number one man, and the other men
making the trip are Ray Pittman, Granville Sharpe, and Charlie Pegram
with Jack Abels playing a first alternate.

In looking over past issues of the Davidsonian the other night,
the writeups in some of the fall issues of the year 1921 came to the
special notice of the writer. The accounts of the football games of
that year were both amusing and informing. In the September 29
issue of that year we find these words: “By squeezing over a touch-
down in the last 15 seconds of play the University of Virginia succeeded
in making the count 28-0 over Davidson in the opening game of the
season.” Then an excerpt from the Oct. 27 issue: “The missing link in
Coach Grey’s Little Electric Machine has been found. The Wofford
Terriers were fed into the machine by Manager Price Jast Saturday,
and they came out in the form of 87-0 sausage. The Davidson pup-
eating Wildcats greedily devoured the canines in six and seven point
margins.” In that Wofford game Davidson scored 87: points, made 34 first
downs, and gained 853 yards. We must have been a veritable Duke
in those days, but considering the 70-0 shellacking we got at the hands
of Georgia Tech, maybe the team wasn’t so potent after all. That year
among the notable achievements were that we held Wake Forest for
six straight times within our one foot line, before they finally put over
the touchdown that beat us 10-7, | We had three ties on consecutive
weeks with Richmond, 14-14, with State, 3-all, and with Carolina, a
scoreless deadlock.

Waller Fouls Out

With eleven minutes remaining in
the game, Captain Jim Waller of
the Forestmen was banished from
the game for excessive fouls. With
him went Wake Forests’ chances
for victory. He was the individual
star of the game, although Baker,
an Ohio State forward, and_ his
teammate Boyd Owen, center, both
outscored him,

Ohio State, in scoring the win
over Wake Forest, broke two tour-
nament records. The team shatter-

held by Army at 53 points. And
Dick Baker tallied 25 points for
the Buckeyes on 10 field goals and
five free throws to destroy the in-
dividual scoring mark held jointly
by Roy Menzel of Pennsylvania
University and Lou Myers, Dicken-

Sigma Phi Epsilon dominated the
scoring as the cream of the fratern-

vied for their respective groups in
the annual Interfraternity Track
classic held here last Wednesday
and Thursday. The Phi Gams e-
merged a close second with the S.

the Kappa Sigs in fourth.

Four fraternity records fell and
one mark was tied during the two
afternoons of competition. Best in-
dividuel performer of the two-day
session was Archie Taylor, Phi Gam
freshman from Winston-Salem.

Elmer Knoeller, S$. P. FE. fresh-
man, broke Iverson’s record in the
discus with a 116.9 ft. and
Don Bell_of Pi Kappa Alpha estab-
lished a new record of 46.6 ft. in the

he cleared 5’ 10”.
