Last Tuesday, the faculty
approved several curricu-
lum changes which had
been proposed by the cur-
riculum committee. The
most pertinent changes
were in the Bible and Eng-

Among the changes ap-
proved was a revision in the
program of the Bible De-
partment.

Beginning with the class
of 1964, all freshmen will

sophomore, junior, or sen-

variety of choices taken
from among courses in
church history, theology,

““‘Work Vs. Value Scale’’

this matter.

,Dean Johnston stated that
“Twenty-two years ago I was
head of a faculty cominittee on
comprehensives and tried to get
them in then. I am certainly
sympathetic to the idea.

“Both comps and senior the-
ses have been under discussion
in the curriculum committee all
year. As yet there has been no
decision made but one should
be derived at between now and
summer.

“If we installed compre-
hensives, they could not be
taken for granted. Rather
they should be a climax to
one’s college career. The fac-
ulty would have to be hard
boiled. If they become taken
for granted it will be the

faculty’s fault.”

Students demonstrated olympic abilities as Davidson became Squaw Valley

' McKeithen argued that any
“stigma” would remain until
independents expressed them-
selves, “not necessarily as a
formal association,” but as a
group.

Later that same evening,
Prof. W. F. Goodykoontz spoke

Probing deeper into the is-
sue, the group enumerated
and elaborated on the many
problems Involved in rushing
procedures. Such issues as
finance, independent group
size, and freshman attitude
to rush week were discussed.

Fraternity men pointed out
that board charges were rough-

that it is ‘an important matter
that we ought to give serious
consideration. We should in-
vestigate successes elsewhere
and decide what we ought to do
in light of our own situation.”

Dr. Purcell of the English de-
partment believed that, ‘‘com-
prehensives would be very val-
uable. We have talked about it
in the English dejartment and
have made tenative plans on
the matter. We have given some
thought to having outside exam-
iners give the tests.

“IT believe that comprehen-
sives would be more valuable
than theses. I am not sure that
all the time given to a thesis
could not he better spent.”

Dr. Goodykoontz, also of
the English department, said,
