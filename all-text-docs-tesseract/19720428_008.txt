The Davidsonian

Students To Organize

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The first steps toward the or-
ganization of a football club will
be taken Monday night with
a meeting of all interested stu-
dents with an organizer of the
Chapel Hill club.

Five schools in North Carolina
presently have clubs, and the
members of the area eonfer-
ence hope to add Davidson and
ECU to their ranks next year.

The Davidson baseball team
defeated two teams of regional
prominence in the last week.

In successive games the Cats
beat the UNC Tar Heels 5-3 and
Duke 9-6.

Wednesday they lost to Bel-
mont Abbey 5-1.

On Thursday they played Ca-
tuwba College, and tomorrow

One of the key figures in the
Chapel Hill club will be in the
Green Room in the College Un-
ion to discuss the organization
of a football club.

A football club is intended to
give students a chance to play
intercollegiate football without
the hassles of regular varsity
play.

The teams play regular 11l-man
tackle football, but such things
as practice time and equipment
are limited by the conference

to equalize play between the
clubs.

Practices are limited to three
days a week in weeks preceding
conference games.

At most, only two days out ot
the three can be for dén-pads
drills or “hitting” practice.

“We wish to keep our play
on the amateur level,” a spokes-
man for the Chapel Hill club
stated, ‘“‘and we have no desire
to drill a lot or do a lot of con-
ditioning.”

Upset UNC, Duke

they will travel to Charleston,
S. C. to play The Citadel in a
doubleheader starting at 1:30
p.m.

The Cats were led by Har-
old Wilkersor. and George Weick-
er against UNC. Each picked up
two hits, both doubles for Weick-
er. Dwight Plemmons pitched a
fine ball game and picked up
the win.

Boyd Seeks Crown

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

Tne Davidson golfers travel
to Sanford Tuesday and Wednes-
day for the Southern Confer-
ence tournament, and Coach
Tom Scott ranks Wildcat Rusty
Boyd as one of the medalist
favorites.

“Rusty has been very consis-
tent this year, and I think he
has a good chance at the indi-
vidual title,” said Scott.

Boyd. a junior from Birming-
ham, Ala. has played in the
number one position on the team
all season and has been point-
ing to the tournament aS a per-
sonal goal.

“I'd really like to win the
championship. and I think I
have a good shot at it,” he ex-
plained.

Describing the 6,900-yard Quail
Ridge course, Boyd noted that
“it's not very long, and the main
thing to do is keep the ball in
play. I cam reach the par fives
in two, and that’s a good way
to pick up strokes.”

Playing in the contingent with
Boyd will be Jim Ray, Bob

Reni, Dick Spinner, Dave Fai- -

son and Sam Mitchener.

Scott stated that the team’s
chances hinged primarily on
the score from the fifth posi-
tion.

In recent weeks the squad has
dropped five matches, but indi-
vidual scores have greatly im-
p: oved.

The Cats were defeated 10%-
itz by N. C. State and 6%5%
by East Carolina on a Raleigh
course which Boyd termed “‘re-
ally poor.” He added that the
temporary greens made play
very difficult.

UNC topped the Cats 11-7 on
April 7, and Boyd set the pace
with a 73. Other Cat scores
were Ray 75, Spinner 76 and
Reni 77.

The linksters fell twice to
Duke by scores of 9%-2'2 and
14-7. Boyd again led the way
with a 71 and a 73, while Spin-

ner’s 74 in the latter match was
his best performance.

Boyd characterized the losses
by saying that the squad played
well, but ‘‘a few bad holes real-
ly hurt us in each match. We’ve
all improved, especially Reni,
who has played well for a fresh-
man, amd Faison, who has cut
his average from 90 to 80.”

most gave the Cats their win.
The score was 5-0 going into the
seventh inning.

In the last three frames not
only were there several errors
and Wildcat hits, but the Blue
Devils also contributed to the
cause by walking in a run.

Weicker had three hits, which
ran his string to seven in three
games. Folger picked up the
victory.

Wednesday, April 26, against
Belmont Abbey the Wildcats had
little luck at the plate. They
faced the Abbey’s ace pitcher,
Penne Holmes.

Earlier in the season Holmes
pitched a no-hitter against the
University of Maryland. Lynn
Wagner had just one hit, but it
knocked in Davidson's only run.

For the Wildcats the sudden
success of Weicker, a freshman,
has been the story of the sea-
son. He has a shot at the con-
ference batting championship
and is now hitting .389.

According to the UNC Club,
the emphasis of club football is
the enjoyment of the game,
without the work involved in
varsity play.

“We have a lot of people
come out who played football
in high school, and would like
to play, but aren't big enough
or don’t have the time for the
varsity.”

He said that in the games
“everyone who can make it to
practice can get to play.”

The conference also states that
all equipment used by club
members must be their own.

“We haven't had any real

problems getting enough equip-
ment,” he said. “A lot of our
players buy outdated equipment
cheaply from the athletic de-
partment or their old high
school coaches.”

The Chapel Hill Club is will-
ing to lend eight full suits to
Davidson to start out.

The clubs are coached by ex-
perienced players or by faculty
members, and have no connec-
tion with the regular football
program. L

The organization of a David-
son club is being handled by
Carl Rizzo, an ex-varsity play-
er.
