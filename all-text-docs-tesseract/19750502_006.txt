William Byrum of the Art
department at UNC-Charlotte.
He expressed his favorable im-
pression with the scope of ar-
tistic endeavors and wide
variety of styles displayed in
the show. He also commented
that overall the works exhibited
showed that many students
were very serious about their
work and that he could see
many were anticipating

careers in the arts. —
There were six awards

presented for the regular show
and Tony’ Snow’s film
“Graduation Day’’, won. the
first award for student films.

Three Honorable Mention
awards were given. One
went to Joe Rodriguez for a
print featuring ‘‘Ted’’ and
“‘Billy’’.

The painting, ‘‘Crucifixion,”’
by Daniel Henderson, and Steve
Fitzgerald’s study in the tex-
tural properties of paper also
received Honorable Mention.

Third award went to Virginia
Newell for a very spontaneous
and expressive linear drawing
of a reclining figure.

Jason Noble won the Second
Award for a print entitled
‘*Precosmic Knowledge:
Goik.’’ This print is very
characteristic of Jason’s casual
and often humoeiaric treatment

Byram critiques student show,
Art features varied expression

logical themes. I believe he
has very fresh style which more
than compensates for his preoc-
cupation with traditional sub-
jects.

The First Award went to me
for a painting which features
the face of Aldous Huxley
reproduced three times across
the canvas, and which is
superimposed over about 1,700
circles of various shades.

Overall I think this show
lacks a great deal of depth , and
many works including my own
are a bit flashy. Nevertheless, it
does show that a great many
students are developing serious
interests in the visual arts.

In the Art department here at
Davidson there are basically
two methods of instruction as
reprsented by Jackson and
Houchens.

The works in the student show
reflect these divergent em-
phasis of classical calculation
and objectivity by Jackson and
the empathetic, expressive,
subjectivity by Houchens.

Overall the show is not
especially spectacular but there
are quite a few very interesting
works throughout.

Most of these works are for
sale, but there is no listing of
works with artists. The Art
department welcomes inquiry
from possible purchasers.
