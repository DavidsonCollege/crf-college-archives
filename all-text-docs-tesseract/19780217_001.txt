Investments

College lacks formal policy

By LYNN PEACE
Staff Writer

Davidson senior Jeff Metzel,
after studying college holdings,
found that ‘‘a lot of Davidson’s
investments are in corporations
in-South Africa.’’ He said that
“like most institutions, David-
son hasn't paid much attention
to where its money is invested.”’

Davidson currently lacks a
formalized statement of invest-
ment policy. The Investment
and Management Committee
will be asked to consider whe-
ther such a statement is needed
at the Trustees’ meeting Fri-
day.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer said ‘‘a formal state-
ment of investment policy
would be desirable.”’

According to Business Man-
ager, Robert A. Currie, ‘‘There
have been no, problems up to
this point with our invest-
ments."’ If a controversial sit-
uation with moral and social
implications were to arise he
said the college might take the
option of adopting a specific
written policy.

The basic objective of the
IMC in managing endowment
funds is to produce maximum
long range financial return, said
Currie.

A decision not to buy securi-
ties from a company would be
made only in cases where the
IMC determines such invest-
ment would violate ‘“‘existing
laws relating to such basic
human rights as health, safety,
or freedom,”’ said Currie.

Currie added that the IMC
would also not buy securities
“solely to achieve an objective
which seems socially desirable.”

No. SEVENTEEN.

The IMC expects its invest-
ment counselors to “‘invest in
companies with excellent man-
agement,” said Currie.

If ever necessary, said Currie,
the Committee could express its
concerns over company practice
directly to the company man-
agement. Currie explained that
normally the IMC expresses its
right of ownership in voting at
stockholders’ meetings -

The Administration will also
recommend that the IMC con-
sider whether Davidson should
endorse the Sullivan Principles.

The Sullivan Principles are

six guidelines for company pol- .

icy in South Africa adopted by
many United States firms. The
principles have been studied
and endorsed by a number of
colleges, including Amherst,
Dartmouth, and Princeton.

International Studies need improvement

By PAM CAMERRA
News Editor
“Every year the same kind of
problems for international stu-

dents come up and are discus-

sed, but nothing is being done,”
said Chairman of the Spanish
Department Lois A. Kemp.

Kemp submitted a recom-
mendation to Vice President of
Academic Affairs T.C. Price
Zimmermann. Listing problems
which, need to be considered ‘“‘if
the Administration is really
concerned about international
education.”’

“I’m 100 percent in favor of
having international students
and of study abroad,’’ said
Kemp. ‘I believe much can be
done that is not currently being
done, to improve, enlarge and
cross fertilize the international
education program.”’

There are at least seven areas
which she thinks must be
improved in order to help
international students who
come to Davidson become bet-
ter integrated into the College
community.

Trustee meeting Friday

The first problem Kemp sees
is the constant. turnover of:
students from year to year. ‘‘It
takes a year for international
students and freshmen alike to
adjust to Davidson,’’ Kemp
explained.

She recommended that Da-
vidson recruit international stu-
dents who would be degree
candidates and spend three. or
four years here. ‘‘These stu-
dents would have a vested
interest in Davidson. They
would be here longer and,
therefore, their impact would be
more significant.”’

“Foreign students who have
been or are currently degree
candidates here like Fai (Wong)
are solid students,’’ she said.

Davidson does not presently
recruit international students as
degree candidates. This is one
area Kemp would like to see’
explored.

Kemp noted six administra-
tive matters in her memoran-
dum to Zimmermann which she
felt needed immediate atten-
tion.

“The first thing the Admini-
stration and International Of-
fice need to do is make scholar-
ship decisions by March 1 or at
least regularize it so we know
how much money will be avai-
lable from one year to the next.
This way we can recruit and
select the international students
earlier and set up some corre-
spondence so they know what to
expect when they get here,’’ she
remarked.

A second problem was spend-

ing money. ‘‘Some international _
students arrive with a lot of!

money while others arrive with
little or none,”’ she explained.
“One of the jobs of the coordi-
nator of international education
should be to provide on-campus
jobs for all international stu-
dents who come here.”’

Another problem is that some
foreign students have no duties
to perform for the College or for
a department. Kemp comment-
ed that these students, who are
on a full or partial scholarship,
should have some responsibility

whether it is tutoring students,
in a foreign language or being a
departmental assistant. She be-

lieves this would increase the
international students’ contacts

with faculty and Davidson stu-

dents.

“Living arrangements have
also not been satisfactory,’’
Kemp continued. ‘Integration
into the College community
would be more pleasant and
easier if international students
could live with 8 or 12 Davidson
students in a house like Hender-
son House or Martin Manor
rather than in the noisy dormi-
tories.”’

Kemp also cited eating facili-
ties as a problem for interna-
tional students. ‘‘These stu-
dents who are 20 or 22 years old
are made to eat at Slater with
over 200 17 and 18 year olds.
This makes it more difficult to
form friendships."

“Why couldn’t space be made
in one of the houses for each of
these students so that they

SGA presents evaluation resolution

By PAM CAMERRA
News Editor

The Student Government Associa-
tion (SGA) will present a Senate
Resolution criticizing Davidson’s lack
. of weil detined procedures and policy
for faculty evaluation to the Board of
Trustees at their meeting on campus
this Friday.

The Resolution, drafted by Senior
SGA Senator David Tinkler and passed
unanimously by the Senate, maintains
that “recent events have revealed the
deficiencies of the policies regarding
the evaluation of faculty members for

renewals of appointments.”’
It points out that, under the College

Constitution, ‘‘the President or his
delegate, in conjunction with the
Faculty of its Committee on Profes-
sional Affairs” is responsible for for-
mulating policies and procedures of

evaluation.
The resolution stems in part from the

Administration’s December 15 decision
to terminate the contract of Tonia
Devon, rrofessor of South. Asian

and Director of the Scush Asian

senaiee piperems because of her “‘level

of competence and effectiveness.”

This decision has brought strong
reactions from a number of students
and faculty in recent weeks. Many have

. questioned the professionalism and ob-

jectivity of the current faculty evalua-
tions process.

Six students met with College
President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and
Vice President of Academic Affairs
T.C. Price Zimmermann on January 18
to express their concern over the
procedure used in Devon’s evaluation.

The students expressed particular
concern over the way student evalua-
tions were handled by the Administra-
tion.

This group of students sent a letter
on February 1 tothe faculty Profes-
sional Affairs Committee (PAC) re-
questing an “immediate and thorough
investigation’’ of the Administration’s
decision not to renew Devon’s contract.

The students brought 6 major con-
cerns to the attention of the PAC. In
the letter, these concerns were:

A Wack of a codified set of
procedures f«~ «slicitingevaluations.

B. Unethical solicitation of student

evaluations--at least one student was
ignorant of the fact that her comments
in an interview with Zimmerman were
to be used in the evaluation of Devon.

C. Inconsistency and vagueness in
the criteria used in Devon’s evaluation.

D. Failure to communicate to Devon
any weakness in her performance or
effectiveness before the non-renewal
decision.

E. Future of thé South Asian Studies
program.

The PAC met February 8 to discuss
the students’ letter and consider the
possibility of conducting an investiga-
tion.

Chairman of the PAC Albert Allen
Wolf (Professor of Physics) issued this
statement at the end of the meeting:
‘As far as the Professional Affairs
Committee is concerned the Devon case
is closed unless Dr. Devon herself
wishes to make a complaint. This
position is in accord with paragraph II
of Article X of the College Constitu-
tion.”’

Paragraph II of Articie X aiiows a
non-tenured faculty member to request

action by the PAC if he believes that a
decision not to reappoint him was
based significantly on considerations
violative of academic freedom, or
consideration violative of stated poli-
cies of the college in respect of

* non-discrimination on the basis of race,

sex, or national origin, in employment
practices, or personal malice: Devon
had not, herself, requested a PAC
investigation.

When informed of the PAC’s deci-
sion, Devon explained why she had not
earlier submitted a statement to the
»PAC: ‘‘The burden of responsibility for
proof rests with me. It’s difficult to
establish for certain whether the Ad-
ministration evidenced personal
malice, discriminated on the basis of
race or sex, or violated academic
freedom in their evaluation of me.”

She said she could establish her
academic and professional qualifica-
tions but that the PAC was looking for
evidence of discriminatory measures
employed by the administration in
their evaluation process.
