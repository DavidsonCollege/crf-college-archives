BAND CONSIDERS EXTENSION

OF THE OLD WILDCAT
SPIRIT

The Wildcat Spirit in Religion was the
topic for discussion in the regular meet-
in
Shearer Hall immediately after the “Y”
H. M. White, in speak-
ing on The Spirit of Loyalty, explained
that loyalty means the willingness to fol-
low, to be faithful to, and to sacrifice
one’s self for those whom he loves, and
He also ex-
plained that there is only one meaning

of loyalty—love; the one great proof

that loyalty is love is that Christ died |

on the cross because of His love for hu-
manity and faithfulness to His Father.

Guiton showed that we should
let ourselves quit because of a
failure, but that we should go into every
worthwhile undertaking with enthusiasm
and be willing to pay the price. A. P.
Hudgitts added to this that we should
always go to God in prayer in case of a
failure, for He wants us to win as much
as we want to win.

G. M. Eddington was the leader for the
meeting. He chose for the scripture les-
son IT Kings 10.

[Seniors Win From Fresh
By Last Minute Spurt

Elkins Shoots Four Goals in First
Minute for Winning Margin

|

| A fast and furious game was played last
fuerte when the Seniors took the long
jend of a 29 to 21 score from the Freshmen.
| The game was full of thrills and sensations,
| both teams playing superhuman ball at times,

The game started off with a bang at a
| quarter to nine and finished at ten-fifteen.
| Coach Rawson called fouls strictly but that
jcould not keep down the fast playing. The
| Seniors, playing to Liston Elkins did not
|have the team work that the Fresh had but
| they handled the ball in an amazingly good
| style, Elkins started off the game with a
| couple of long shots to start the ball to roll-
| ing and it kept rolling for the rest of the
}game. The fresh got right on to Elkins
jthen and didn’t let him score but one more
| field goal that period. The fresh came in
strong toward the end of the half and the
team work coupled with the good shooting
of Winn enabled them to roll up seven points
in about five minutes. The half ended with
the score standing 16 to 9 in favor of the
| Seniors.

The second half-started off with the same
rush that was exhibited in the first half and
no one scored until Fawcette dropped one
{through the net. Just after this Elkins col-
|lided with Kiser and had to be taken from
|the game. After Elkins left, Boushee and
| McLaurin cach put one through the basket
| and a free shot by Brown put the Seniors
, ahead with the score 21 to 14. The Fresh-
|men called time out and then went back and
|ran up the score to twenty-one before any-
one knew what it was all about. The score
| was 21-21 and a minute remained for play.
| Then for three straight times the Seniors
| worked a combination; McBryde to Bou-
|shee to Elkins, that resulted in a goal each
|time. The game ended just after this.

| The teamwork and individual play of each
|team was remarkable. It served to make
|this the most interesting game of the series.

A Wildcat may be down but he’s never

Clemson may have the edge on the Wild-
|cats when it comes to weight, but perhaps

| the edge won't be sharp.

What we call the height of disaster. To
lose a football game by less than a foot.
The Tigers at Clemson may be the man
cating kind, but Wildcats are one thing that
Tigers don't eat.

Not so bad!

The North Carolina Farmers, the South
Carolina farmers the next. That Red and
Black machine ought to be the stuff on a
plowed field when they get through.

Did you know that:

The State Freshmen outweighed the Wild-
kittens twenty pounds to the man.

That the Kittens made twice as many first
downs as the State did.

The State didn't complete a single pass.

That the D. C. Fresh outpunted the farm-
ers,

That State had two guards that weighed
190 and a center 180. And that the only way
they could gain was thru the line.

That Hewlett had a clean field for a
touchdown, but the ball was called back, of f-
side.

That again Hewlett got away for 80 yards
but he was called back, out of bounds.

That a certain professor of History jour-
neyed over to Pinehurst to see Fresh Mc-
Connell play.

That State fumbled on the play that made
the touchdown, but the ball went straight
ahead and none of the Kittens could get. it.

That Sapp played the game of his life.

But, after all that State won, 7-0.

It must be hard luck to burn down Cham-
bers.

We were glad that somebody made a mis-
take and. that Clemson V. P. I. score wasn’t
notched.at 9 all.

Our chain-gang list—Wearers of pink der-
by. The following Freshmen were vocifer-
ous at the Senior-Fresh game :

Ted Koenig, Sam Summers, Young
“Alki,” “Tommy” Lingle, Jr., Fresh Hew- |
lett, Fresh Turner.

Maybe Elkins didn’t ring ’em up in the last
few seconds, and maybe the Fresh didn’t give
the Seniors a yell.

Which by the way reminds us that there
isn’t any way much better for the Fresh to
get spirit than to let them have organized
yelling at the games.

Juniors Defeat Sophs In
Slow and Listless Game

McNair, High Scorer for Juniors
Morrison Guards Well

In probably the slowest game seen during
the season the Juniors defeated the Sophs
26 to 17, last Friday night. There were
only a few persons out to watch this battle
and as the play was going on the sidelines
were as dead as the proverbial door-nail.

The game started off too slow to be in-
teresting. The play began when Ed Morri-
son shot a foul for a single point, and then
the Sophs got their only points on the half
when Cooke and Coltrane each shot a field
goal in rapid succession. The Juniors, with
the two forwards and MeNair leading, kept
passing the ball and guarding in a way that,
while it was slow, kept their opponents at
sea. They outplayed the Sophs in every
department of the game in this half and
rolled up a score big enought to keep the
other team at bay for the remainder of the
game. The playing of Pat McNair and the
guarding of the whole Junior team was the
most prominent feature of this period. The
whistle blew at the end of the half with the
score standing 15 to 4, in favor of the Jun-
iors.

The intermission saw the waking up of the
crowd on each side. On the beginning of
play-the Sophs proceeded to rush the other
team off its feet but a couple of fouls call-
ed at inopportune times slowed down the play
considerably. The first bit of fast play
came at the beginning of this half. Through-
out the remainder of this period the Sophs
outplayed the Juniors completely. If they
had been able to shoot goals with a little
more accuracy the score would have been
a bit closer to say the least. They got at
least three times the number of shots that
the Juniors procured but were unable to
make them good, while the other team was
getting at least one out of evry three shots
through the big ring. McNair kept up his
good work and scored six more points.
Lawson substituting for Montgomery, was
high scorer on the Soph team. He rang
three field goals for six points.

GOLF COURSE AND TEAM
BEING FAST DEVELOPED

The college golf course is being put in
good condition. The putting greens are be-
ing rolled, and the course is being gone
over carefully to work out the bad spots over
it. The leaves are being raked off and
burned.

Doctor Arbuckle states that the course is
in the best condition he has ever seen it for
this time of the year. Every afternoon he
has about 10 boys raking leaves, cutting
grass, rolling the greens and cutting the rub-
bish along the sides of the course. Workers
are plentiful, and all the tools available are
used every afternoon, Doctor Arbuckle has
had to keep a waiting list and the boys that
| apply to him are put on this list so that they
| will receive the job of some that feel like
| they have worked enough for one time.
| The prospects for a good course this year
jare bright and Doctor Arbuckle hopes to
keep it in the present condition, if not in
| better shape than it is now,

With two old men back prospects look
|good for a winning golf team this year.
| With Ernhardt and Bachman as a pair to
build around, a good team should result.
Fresh Reeves is showing some class in prac-
tice and should make a good man before the
season is over. Others are showing some
fine playing, and the remainder of the team
will be picked from these. There is no
reason why Davidson canno& put out a good
golf team this year,
