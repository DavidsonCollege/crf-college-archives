Beyond Davidson

_ By ED POWELL

Economy--Unemployment rose from
5.4% to 5.6% in August, possibly as a sign
of a slow down in the economic expan-
sion of the last 6 years. 219,000 new
payroll jobs were added in August, but
that figure is less than half that of June.
‘Stock and bond markets have rallied in
the last week, as slowed down economic
growth has eased fears of soaring interest
rates. It may be that the move by Alan
Greenspan and the Federal Reserve to
edge ‘the interest rates up earlier this
summer has indeed been effective in
controlling inflation, at least it appears.

Elections--Since the Republican Na-
tional Convention in New Orleans, Vice
President George Bush has made up a 17
point deficit and pulled even with Demo-
cratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor
Michael Dukakis, in the latest national
polls on the Presidential race. Most politi-
cal analysts believe that Governor
Dukakis must make some significant
moves in the next three weeks if he is. to
regain his ledd; At the end of last week,
Dukakis rehired his former campaign
manager John Sasso to serve as campaign
vice chairman. Sasso resigned last year
during the primaries in the wake of con-
troversy surrounding his release of video
tapes that damaged the reputation of then
Presidential hopeful, Senator Joe Biden
of Delaware. The videos called into ques-
tion the authenticity of some of Biden’s

National News

speeches and Biden withdrew his name
from the race soon after their release.

Closer to home, Davidson graduate
Governor Jim Martin is gearing up for his
reelection campaign against Democratic
Lt. Governor Robert Jordan. Things look
good for Martin as unemployment is way
down and he has enjoyed a prosperous
four years in office. As the incumbent he
is the early,favorite, but unlike in 1984, he
probably won’t be able to ride the coat-
tails of Bush like he did President Re-
agan’s. Reagan carried much more
weight in 84 than Bush will come No-
vember. One small note, of registered
voters in North Carolina, Democrats out-
number Republicans 2 to 1.

Agriculture--Fires continue to burn out of
control in. the west, particularly in Yel-
lowstone Park in Wyoming. The blazes
have covered 910,000 acres, nearly a
fourth of all the acreage of Yellowstone
Park. Officials estimate the cost of put-
ting out the fires to exceed 30 million, not
to mention their loss from a 30% drop in
tourists in the month of August. The ex-
tremely dry summer is to blame for the
spread of the blazes.

Other--Jim Bakker is still trying to regain
PTL. On Monday he claimed to be close
to meeting the 150 million dollar asking
price for PTL, but stated that he still
needed a few more investors to raise the
remainder of the money.

¢ Forty-six people were killed and 500
others injured when three Italian military
jets collided and crashed to the ground at
an air show in Ramestein, West Ger-
many, about 60 miles from Frankfurt. A

crowd of about 300,000 had gathered to .

watch the annual air show when a pilot-
ing error caused one of the planes to
collide with two others during a difficult
fly past maneuver. In response to the trag-
edy, already labeled one of the worst
crashes in air show history, the West Ger-
man Government has suspended -indefi-
nitely any, further military air shows.

¢ The Soviet Union destroyed three SS-
‘20 nuclear missiles in a symbolic start to
the elimination of its intermediate nu-
clear weapons force. The missiles were
the first group of SS-20’s to be eliminated
under the terms of the U.S. Soviet INF
Treaty signed in December by President
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, which
provides for the gradual elimination of all
ground launched and medium range nu-
clear weapons from the superpower’s .
nuclear arsenals.

¢ Less thana month after its negotiation,
the U.N. Iran-Iraq cease-fire resolution is

_| deadlocked over the Iraqi demand that

Iran guarantee unhindered navigation for
Iraqi ships in the Persian Gulf and that
Theran re-open the vital Shatt Arab wa-
terway that is Iraq’s only outlet to the sea.
Iran responded claiming Iraq’s allega-
tions were ridiculous and outside the

‘realm of the current round of peace talks.

The U.N. resolution was enacted to bring
about peace in the Gulf region and to end
the 8 year Iran Iraq war; U.N General
Secretary Javier Perez deCellar hopes
that the current differences can be re-
solved and negotiations resumed.

¢ Protests broke out in Santiago and
other regions in Chile last week over the
nomination of Augusto Pinochet as the
sole nominee in the country’s presiden-
tial referendum scheduled for October 5.
Opposition fears the continuation of the

repressive Pinochet regime; if the leader
is re-elected, he will continue in office
until 1997. Pinochet has ruled Chile’s
military-backed government since the
1973 coup which ousted the Marxist
Allende regime.
e Lech Walesa, leader of the Polish labor
force, met formally with government of- '
ficials to discuss the legalization of the
Polish Solidarity movement. The meet-
ings, the first since Solidarity was out-
lawed by the government in 1982, was
prompted by a wave of nationwide
strikes intended by labor leaders to force
their government into negotiations.
Walesa subsequently halted the strikes
late last week when Polish officials
agreed to address the status of solidarity
in exchange for an end to the 20 days of
labor unrest.
¢ The pullout of the U.S. missile cruiser
USS Vincennes from the Persian Gulf
was abruptly delayed after at least one
arab government raised last minute ob-
jections to its departure. The Vincennes,
responsible for the July downing of an
Iranian Airbus, was scheduled to leave
Persian Gulf waters for the U.S. Sunday.
Military sources estimate that the Vin-
cennes will remain in its present station
for at least five more days. Reducing
Gulf force from 27 to 26 ships, the Vin-
cennes will represent the first cutback of
U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf
since the Iran-Iraq cease fire went into
effect in August.
¢ U.S. negotiations to forge a new agree-
ment on U.S. airbases in Greece ground
toa halt Tuesday after the Greek govern-
ment announced it will close the U.S. Air
Force installation in Athens. The suspen-
sion comes as the U.S.-Greek defense
agreement on the presence of such bases
is about to expire. Greek Prime Minister
Andrea Papandreou stated Tuesday his
country will consider signing another
military bases agreement in exchange for
U.S. intervention in certain areas such as
the long running Greek-Turkish dispute.
