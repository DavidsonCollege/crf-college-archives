Tough With Blackjack
Clubs Student At P. O.

Sv A Witness
As Told To
Tom Loflin

Ed. note: The crime wave of Charlotte, the Spearhead of the South in that category, washed
north Monday night and struck Davidson College.

“If you wanted to start a little war up there, you picked the wrong place to do it,”
Judge Winfred Ervin of the County Recorder's Court told Johnny Jenkins at his trial
Wednesday for his assault charge on Davidson student Bill Haile.

Bill, my fraternity brother
(Sig Ep). was strolling across the
campus. Monday night about
nine. He was heading for the
Phi Hall to study. Just before
he got to the college well, three
dark figures started to pass him.
Suddenly he found himself on
the wrong end. of a punch. His
glasses flew one way but he re-
covered from the shock of the
blow and fought back. The strug-
gle ended in a stalemate.

After the three left him. Bill
came and got me and Jim Lit-
trell, Flash Foster. Jimmy
Downey, Joe McCormack. Cary
Baton, and some freshman to
help find his glasses. With the
aid of a spotlight, after 45 min-
utes searching, we finally found
them in the grass.

We went down fo the post
office. As we came out, we
encountered the three who
had jumped Bill earlier. All of
them were peering at him and
laughing about how he had

‘brought la whole mob of col-
lege students to fight them.

Bill asked Jenkins if he were
the one that fought him earlier.
The. townie only laughed and
kept saying ‘Let's fight: let's
go!’ They began to scuffle, and
Bill aimed a kick at his groin.
But he missed and only got a
thigh instead. Then he began to
back Jenkins behind the post
office and toward the railroad
tracks. One of the other townies
went along. But I stayed with
the third one.

He was a real nasty kid and
kept telling me, ‘I’m going to
cut you up.’ Bill then came
back and told us that Jenkins
ran from him and said he was
going to get his gun to shoot
us all,

We waited in front of the P.O.
out of curiosity to see what
would happen. Every time a car
came by, Littrell and Foster
would run behind the P.O.,

Academic Probation

(Continued From Page One)
probation regulation, without
decreasing the penalty of it,
increases the chances of endan-
gering the benefits from extra-
curricular organizations.”

‘In desiring to answer par-
ticular questions about the

effect of athletics on a stud-
ent, Prof. Martin studied and
compiled data on both the
football and basketball! teams.
He found out that men in such
extracurricular activities do
not reflect any more under-
achievement or negligence
than the rest of the student
body.

The Executive Committee said
that it will propose that the
Faculty do away with placing a
freshman on probation due to
his grade report in the first six-
weeks of his college career. It
will ask, if this proposal is not
accepted, that it be possible for
freshmen to be removed from
probation at mid-semester.

Such a liberalizing trend here
indicates that there is a definite
possibility of the committee's
recommending than any student
be freed from probation at any
grading period if he has met re-
quirements.

Two other recommendations
have been made by outside
sources, and it is possible that
both may be presented for the
approval of the Faculty. One
is thet students on probation
‘be allowed to have four cuts
for one semester; or, if it is
decided that probation be only
for each grading period, that
‘two cuts be allowed for each
such period (of one-half se-
mester duration).

It is true that students on
probation need at times to take
cuts for constructive purposes.
They should be allowed to have
a minimum number, say the
advocates of this idea.

The other proposal is, instead
of a student, coach, or organi-
zational director having more
responsibility placed on him by
severe academic probation re-
quirements, to put more respon-
sibility where it belongs—on the
faculty. Every student on pro-
bation would have a weekly con-
ference with professors in whose
courses he was meeting with
failure.

Such a program. proponents

argue, would not be mere har-
assment of a failing student, but
rather action of a positive. na-
ture designed to help solve
specific student problems and
point up reasons for fhe stud-
ent's failure.

The Faculty meeting will be
important for every student at
Davidson, for, at times. even
good students fall below stand-
ards. And every student is cer-
tainly interested in the success
of the extracurricular programs
of the college. Whatever the
result, the entire Student Body
will benefit—or suffer.

fearing that. something like you
see in The Untouchables might
happen.

Then a car drove up, and the
three townies got out. They held
their hands in their back poc-
kets like they might have weap-
ons. We didn’t know what they
had. They demanded a fight.
Littrell and Foster went to call
the county police.

The rest of us started backing
the three behind the post office
again. When we got behind the
building, Bill and Jenkins start-
ed scuffling. The rest of us
watched. Suddenly the townie
pulled a dark object from his
pocket and hit Bill on the. head
with it. Bill did not go down.

hand and by me. ! picked i¢
up. it was e blackjack and a
reat wicked thing with a flexi-
ble handle, a weight wrapped
in bleck tape, end lead
weights dangling from the
end.

When I looked around again,
Bill was on top of the townie
and had a strangle hold ‘on him.
Then Dean Burts and a group of
boys came down and broke the
affair up. Later the county po-
lice heard about the blackjack
and arrested Jenkins on the
charge of simple assault.

At the trial, the judge chang-
ed the charge to assault with a
deadly weapon and turned the
19-year-old over to the probation
officer who will work out a pro-
gram to help him.

1 understand the college is
now studying a way to light our
campus.

Honor Court _

(Continued From Page One)
Honor Court has the duties to
educate the student body in
regard to the Honor System,
to investigate and to try pos-
sibte violation of the Honor
Code and the student body
regulations, and to encourage
honesty in every way it can.

But lest one believe that the
Honor System is something that
six seniors, four juniors and two
sophomores are going to impose
on nine hundred students —
“every student has an individual
responsibility to uphold the
Honor System.”

Each student is to learn, abide
by, and report violations of the
Honor Code and the Student
Body Regulations. And each is
to be a co-operative enterprise
from which each participant will
reap the benefits of an honest
environment.

Questioned as to the more
pragmatic efforts of the Honor
Court to educate the student
and “to encourage honesty,”
Arbuckle said: “The present
Honor Court has gone out on a
limb trying to emphasize the
positive aspects of the Honor
System, rather. than the nega-
tive.”

As examples of this, he
pointed first to the court's
handling of dormitory dis-
courtesy—aen individual is
given an informal warning
and a formal letter before
trial and possible punishment
on the third violation.
Second, he revealed that the

periences were unusual, !
guess you might say,” de-
elared Dr. Martin. “No one of
them sticks especially in my
memory. it certainly was
something to meet ail those
young men and realize that
they were once students here,
though. | was surprised, but
t had a hard time keeping
of all of them and remember-
ing just when they were
here.”

Mrs. Martin said the strangest
feeling they experienced was in
Sept., when they were in Edin-
burgh. “We suddenly realized
that school had already opened
back here, that the freshmen
were settled, and that the facul-
ty tea for new students was over
with—and we hadn‘t thought a

thing about it!”

She went on to say, “It may
seem strange, but 1 guess our
most meaningful experiences
were those that are deeply per-
sonal and would not mean much
to anyone else.”

But then, that’s not too un-
usual. Is it not that way with} selves
enough for such a liberalization.

of students gambling in frater-
nity houses, but felt that a fair
warning was sufficient.

In both of these instances of
violations of the student body
regulations, “the second chance
has been given—liberality here
can be stretched no further.
Students have been warned of
the consequences of further
violations; and the court has
made its policies more firm and
its expectations clearer.”

Further, since “the court
cannot encourage honesty by
letting dishonest acts go un-
noticed,” Arbuckle felt two
warnings needed to be given: |
First, the Davidson tradition
of stealing road signs, beer
displays, and so on to decor-
ate dorms is basically a dis-
honest act and will be tried
under student body regule-
tions.

The townie swung again,
and the object flew out of his

Second, cases of inaccurate
vespers and Sunday morning at-
tendance reports have been oc-
curring. These will be realt with
as Honor Court violations.

Severity the court has been
accused of, largely because sev-
eral students have been expell-
ed in the last few years. But as
Arbuckle said: “The Court is
not concerned with the student,
body charge of being severe. In
many cases to perform its func-
tion adequately the court must
be severe. The court, however,
is concerned with being labeled
as unduly severe.”

Finally, Arbuckle added
that in cooperation with Stud-
ent Body President John
Spratt, a proposal is being
discussed which would consid-
er the trunks of student cars
as being off-campus.

Thus, students would “hon-
estly” keep liquor “on-campus”
and the Davidson ostrich could
pull its head out of the sand.

However, Arbuckle wondered
if students had proved them-
capable and mature

Liquor Study Shows
Less Than Expected

Less liquor on campus than had been expected, the
amount decreasing from upper to lower classes, and a
large amount carried ‘‘on the person“ over the weekend is
the report of the liquor poll taken last Monday after the
Homecoming Weekend as reported by Student Council
President John Spratt at the council’s meeting this week.

He stressed that Student Coun-
cil and Honor Court members
were honor bound to report vio-
lations and then asked that the
numerical results of the poll not
be publicized.

Spratt brought up the ques-
tion of the Freshman Regula-
tions at the meeting and met
with two schools of thought on
the subject. There seemed to be
two almost equal groups on the
issue, and the battle was pitch-
ed against the regulations. They
were “childish and purposeless”
in the eyes of councilman Wal-
ter MacDonald.

Freshman Advisor Tommy
Stafford was in favor of drop-
ping the regulations since the
freshmen had done their part in
building the bonfire and a tie
in football was considered a win
by the freshmen.

Fred McQuirt said he rather
enjoyed the regulations and said
that every class should go
through them as something to
look back upon, Hill Wellford
was in favor of two weeks of
strict enforcement of the regu-
lations. Sophomores Dave Harde-
man and Arnie Snider felt that
the Field Day results required
some penalty on the freshmen
sinee they had lost.

When the issue came to vote
it. was 8&6 against ending the
regulations. It was then unani-

mously decided that the fresh-|

men should wear coats, ties and
name tags through Friday.

Spratt discussed the Nation-
al Student Association debate
and said that a referendum
would be no sooner than two
weeks. Hardeman announced
@ regional meeting of the NSA
which will be held at N.C.
State College in Raleigh over
the weekend of Nov. 15-16.

Among other things discussed
by the Student Faculty Confer-
ence at their meeting on Thurs-
day, according to Spratt, the
new Academic Probation Rules
were scrutinized, a motion was

receive credit for attendance at
vespers, and President Martin’s
approval was asked on the ques-
tion of a Communist speaker for
a second semester chapel speak-
er.

Spratt announced that a vote
would be taken at next Mon-
day’s meeting on the election
changes proposed by the special
committee to investigate the
nomination and election system
at Davidson. Among these
changes there is a call for a
common ballot, which would
shorten the time for the whole
election procedure, and the new
method of nomination.

Duke Dean Delves
Into Death Sunday

Dr. James T. Cleland, dean of
the chapel at Duke University,
will be the Sunday evening ves-
pers speaker. Dr. Cleland's ser-
mon is “Some Reflections of
Death,” one of a number of
topics chosen by students in a
poll taken last year.

Dr. Cleland has been at. Duke
since 1945. Prior to this time
he held a teaching fellowship
at Glasgow University Divinity
Hall and was associate profes-
sor of religion at Amherst Col-
lege. During his tenure at Duke
he has also held visiting pro-
fessorships at Union Theologi-
cal Seminary and at Pacific
School of Religion.

The son af a Scottish minister,
Dr. Cleland graduated from
Glasgow University in 1929
with his BD.. He then proceed-
ed to Union Theological Sem-
inary in New York City and re-
ceived his STM in 1928. He has
since received his ThD from
there.

Dr. Cleland holds many hon-
ors and honorary degrees, in-
cluding an honorary DD from
Davidson College, Omicron Delta

Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa mem-

bership at Duke, and honorary
DD at Glasgow University.

He has been responsible for
a number of articles and publi-
cations. One of the more note-

discussed which would allow! worthy of these wag a series of

Catholics and Jews to attend the
nearest house of worship and

articles in The Chaplein written
as a “Preaching Clinic.”

Reeculations Flicker Out;
Sophs’ Hopes Thwarted

BY BILL HUFFORD

Beanies, name tags and no walking on the grass will become a thing of memory
as freshmen regulations end at midnight tonight.

Many sophomores who parti-
cipated in the Field Day just to
keep the freshmen regulations
were disappointed as their ef-
forts were washed down the
drain. For according to the
Wildcat Handbook, “Regulations
shall be in effect until Thanks-
giving, unless the Freshmen win
the Field Day....”

The events leading to the ab-
dication of the regulations show-
ed confusion rampant on the

part of the beanie regulators.

It all began with the freshmen
beanie burn and riot one week
before Field Day. Tommy Staf-
ford, freshman advisor, decided
not to punish the beanieless
freshmen and wait for the in-
evitable outcome of Field Day.

But the sophomores threw the
wrench into the mechanics of
ending freshmen regulations by
whipping the frosh 39-20. Trying
to prevent the continuance of
the freshmen regulations, John
Spratt. president of the Student
Council, got up before chapel

Unexpurgated Flick
Heads IRC Plans

An uncensored film taken
behind the Iron Curtain in Com-
munist China will highlight the
program at the next meeting of
the International Relations Club
(IRC) Wednesday night at 7:15
in the Green Room of the Union.
The film was taken in 1959 by
Western newsmen touring
China.

Dr. Paul Marrotte, associate
professor of history, who is an
authority on the Far East, will
introduce the film and answer
questions during the meeting.

At the IRC’s last meeting on
Oct. 23, three foreign students—
Eric Heinz, Joon Yoo and Ben
Nzengu—discussed the United
Nations recent actions. The pro-
gram was on the anniversary of
UN Day, Oct. 24.

IRC President Grier Stephen-
son has planned future meetings
to include a program on social
conditions in India, a panel dis-
cussion on communism with
four foreign students, and a
movie and speaker on the
Army's special forces in South-
east Asia.

Stephenson
meetings of the IRC are open
all to students and faculty, not-
ing tbat the ERC has no official
membership and its programs
are designed for those interested
in foreign affairs.

and told the freshmen if they
would built a bonfire for the
pep rally afd if the football
team won, the regulations would
end.

The football team tried, but
didn't quite fulfill the contract
by winning. Thus, the regula-
tions were still in effect, tech-
nically, but no freshman paid
any attention to the rules.
Last Monday night the Student
Council narrowly voted to
keep the regulations in effect
this week by requiring coat
and tie.

Asked whether this was a de-
feat for the sophomore class,
Dave Hardeman, president of
the sophomore class and rep-
resentative on the Student
Council, replied, ‘Well, in a
sense. That’s why we made them
wear the coat and tie. We also
felt that the purposes of the
regulations had been achieved.”

Spratt added, “Going all the
way to Thanksgiving with the
regulations was unthinkable. We
couldn’t enforce them.”

: The withdrawal of the regula-

tions, therefore, resulted from
two things—the achievement of
the purpose and the problem of
enforcement. The purposes, be-
lieves Hardeman, are three: To
develop class unity and spirit,
to make the freshmen aware
that they have as yet given no
significant contribution to Dav-
idson and to continue the tradi-
tion.

Ben Reeves, president of the

Freshman Council, said they
had fulfilled their purpose. “The
regulations did produce spirit
in the freshman class. They have
made us realize we just came
here.”

Enforcement hes always
been a question this year.
Many freshmen didn‘t observe
the rules at all. Hardeman de-
scribed the action of the
Freshman Court of Control as
“somewhat fax,” especially in
not punishing the early viola-
tors. “If the regulations were
better enforced at first,” said
Reeves, “the freshmen would-
nt have minded obeying
them.”

The punishment was also mild.
Of the 20 freshmen to be hauled
before the court, the second-time
violators were only “disciplin-
ed” by writing an essay, helping
on field day or cleaning out the
wildcat cage.

‘TI want a lot of changes,”
bellowed Stafford. He pointed
to two major areas of inconsist-
ency, enforcement and the pur-
pose of the regulations. “There
is a lot of work needed in re-
valuation of the regulations.
Both the Freshman Council and
Freshman Court have been ask-
ed to study the situation.”

The trend, Stafford pointed
out, is toward dolng away with
the regulations. At least one
member of the Student Council
wants to abolish the regulations
altogether. Stafford ended,
“There definitely will be some
changes next year.”

HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?

Today let us address ourselves to a question that has tong rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student better off at a sual!

college than at a large college?

To answer this question it is necessary first to define terms,
What, exactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some
say that in order to be called truly small, a college should have
an enrollment of not more than four students.

I surely have no quarrel with this statement; a four-student
college must unequivocally be called small. Indeed, I would
even call it intime if I knew what intime meant. But I submit
there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for instanoe, a
recent unfortunate event at Crimscott A and M.

Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled

between Philadelphia

Wid eaclly

and Salt Lake City, was founded by

A, We

?

A. and M. Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1625
to escape the potato famine of 1841. As a result of their fore-
sight, the Crimscott brothers never went without potatoes for

one single day of their livese—and mighty

grateful they were!

One night, full of gratitude after a wholesome meal of French
fries, cottage fries, hash browns, and au gratin, they decided
to show their appreciation to this bountiful land of potatoes
by endowing a college. But their generosity contained one
stipulation: the enrollment of the college must never exceed
four students. They felt that only by keeping the school this
small could each student be assured of the personalized atten-
tion, the camaraderie, the esprit, that is all too often lacking in
larger institutions of higher learning.

Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday
a few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football,
as you can well imagine, was something of a problem at Crim-
scott, what with only four undergraduates in the entire college.
It was easy enough to muster a backfield, but to find a good
line—or even a bad line—baffled some of the most resourceful

coaching minds in the nation.

Well sir, on the morning of the big game against Minneso
ite traditional rival, a capricious fate dealt Crimsocott a eruel
blow—in fact, four cruel blows, Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with an impacted incisor. Wrichards,
the slotback, flunked his taxidermy exam and was declared in-
eligible. Beerbohm-Tree, the wingback-tailback, got his neck-
tie caught in his espresso machine. Yuld, the fullback, was

stolen by gypsies.

Consequently, none of the Crimscott team showed up at the
football game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to
score almost at will. Crimscott was eo oross after this humiliating
defeat that they immediately broke off football relations with
Minnesota, its tradtional rival. This later became known as

the Sacco-Vanzetti Case.

So you can see how only four students might be too meagre
an enrollment. The number that I personally favor is twenty.
Why? you. ask. Because, I reply, when you have twenty
students and one of them opens a pack of Marlboro Cigarettes,
there are enough to go around for everybody, and no one has
to be deprived of Marlboro’s flavor, of Marlboro’s filter, of
Marlboro’s staunch and steadfast companionship, and as a
result you have a student body that is brimming with sweet
content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness
and soft pack and Flip-Top box.

That’s why.
