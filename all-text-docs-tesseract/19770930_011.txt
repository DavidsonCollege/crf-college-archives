Newell showed hope for the depart-

student support. Kimmel comments, :

‘Most people’s visual experience is so
limited there is not nearly the
appreciation here which would be so
easy to learn.”’

But the lack of support does not
bother George King. “For me art is a
religious experience. It’s the ‘god-
trip’ all the way. You take some
paint, create the universe, sit back on

What is the role of music at

the position of the other Fine Arts in
many schools: simply a token sector
of the Liberal Arts whole? These are
‘the important questions to be consi-

. The music program here is designed
first for the students. For the

‘;mon-music majors, the department

offers instruction in Applied Music

- (private instrumental training), a
‘mu§ic appreciation course, and parti-

cipation in the various campus musi-
cal groups.
The music major has these same

choices With the exclusion’ of music

appreciation, plus the courses speci-
fied for majors in the college catalog.
Applied music, at present, is

. available in organ, piano, voice and
“brass. If interest is shown in other
‘instruments, musicians from Char-
-Jotte will be made available for lessons

whenever possible.
A wide slate of events including the

. Sacred Music Convocation, student

and faculty recitals, and the Chamber
Music Series are presented by the
music department.

So what is the music program’s
place in this particular liberal arts
environment?

Professor Donald B. Plott, chair-

involved, however,

man of the music department, feels
that ‘“‘The administrations’s view of
the department is certainly not token.
We have never,” says Plott, ‘‘had any
needs that were not met as soon as it
was financially possible by the admin-
istration.”

Plott feels that, according to the
budget reports, financial support of
the music department is:adequate to
cover the performing groups as well
as the course offerings. —

The student apathy concerning the
music department provides some
basis for the possible ‘‘souvenir
status”’ of the department. One: not
in: any ofthe
musical activities or ‘courses would
not realize, according to Dr. Plott,
‘About a quarter of the student body
is directly involved with the music
department in some way during the
school year.””

The department’s main problem, at
present, continues to be one of space
and manpower. In its nearly 50
year history, the music department
has grown substantially making for
inadequate practice facilities and an
extreme strain on the listening lib-
rary.

Plans for expansion to Cunningham
are in the works'and will follow-under
Davidson’s 1987 program. eM

Although the number of music
majors is relatively low, 15 people this
year, compared to other dep:irtments
on campus, it is not non-productive or
in a state of decline. One must

$ on a pamun vv

consider the difficulties of being a
music major in a highly competitive
environment.

Dr. William D. Lawing notes,
“People do not realize what a music
major in trumpet must go through.
At least five hours per week are
involved with ensemble work not to
mention the extra 7-14 hours per week
of necessary individual practice.’’ The
same, of course, holds true for music
majors in other areas.

Time becomes the main factor as
ong tries to reconcile his practice
requirements with the academic. de-

mands of a vigordus liberal arts

institution.

For’ the music major, the depart-
ment stresses a double focus. Applied
music, or performance and composi-
tion as well as'musicology, or the
académic study of music, constitute
the two areas: of emphasis.

__ According:to Professor Wilmer
Welsh, ‘I d6-not know of any
institution like Davidson which is

Naturally there are deficiencies in

' areas where the conservatories are

able to spend more time in in-depth
examinations and studies of musical
trends and developments; but asa
whole, according to Dr. Welsh, ‘‘The
Davidson student ends.up almost as
well-prepared in music as the conser-

Natory student and much better

prepared in his ability to handle ideas,

musical and other.” @
The music major at Davidson, in

many ‘ways, has an’ advantage over

‘the ‘conservatory-trained musician.
- He‘has' the benefit of a wide-ranging
education that will hopefully enrich

his understanding of his art.

very well motivated. Because of the

‘Tt is the same thing with

Zimmerman readily admit-
ted that Davidson badly needs
new facilities in the arts, and
College - President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. readily con-
curred: “It is very impo:.ane
for the College to make the

sort of strong statement in the
arts as it does in other
academic areas.

‘Things are relative with
respect to time, and when
Cunningham Fine Arts Buil-
ding was completed a few
years back, it looked magnifi-
cent. But obviously, the bur-
geoning of the arts has made it
inadequate now,’’ he said.

Spencer said the: atacnas-
tration’s one objective in plans

ments in Commies.

“The drama department, in
cooperation with (Director of
the Physical Plant) Grover C.
Meetze, has drawn up two
tentative plans,” said Spen-
cer. “Plan One would decide
what to do with the space

«made available-in Cunrin----

ham after the visual arts

Two would involve the en-
largement of Cunningham in
some way, if this.were found
to be necessary.”

However, Spencer indicated
that these plans would proba-
bly not be carried out in the

_ Rear future, and so Davidson
fine arts students and staff
must be prepared to continue
to ‘‘broaden the horizons of
