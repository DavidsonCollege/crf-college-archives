THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1996

Davidson, as an institution,
has always been committed to an
academic standard far more rigor-
ous than most colleges and uni-
versities around the country. It
has assembled one of the most
impressive faculties available in
‘academia anywhere. Davidson’s
students are, for the most part,
highly motivated me and extremely
bright. They generally enjoy learn-
ing and are eager and receptive to
the teachings of their professors.
Professors, in turn, try to make
their classes interesting and chal-
lenging (usually, the “challenging”
part of that equation is readily
within their grasp).

That is the circle of life, and it
is a delicate equilibrium between
student and institution; each push-
ing equally as hard against the
other. As we come upon exam
time, however, we arrive ata breach
in that equilibrium. As we all
know, this week is a week of de
jure optional class days but de
facto regular class days. Very few

professors ended their classes last
week, and many of us have class
right up until reading day. That
leaves us with one day to gear up
for exams.

Having only one reading day
is abslolutely preposter-

without a doubt one of the best
aspects of Davidson’s academic
life. At Davidson, however, we
become numb to the idea of work
quantities. We hear “I have four
papers and two tests next week” so

to memorize an entire semester’s
worth of work, often upwards of a
thousand pages of text. The actual
amount of time it takes to do that
and do it well is baffling. Just

frustrating aspects of aca-
demic life at Davidson.
Throughout the semes-
ter there is a feeling of
partnership-in-learning
between students and
professors, but it is on
reading day and during
exam time that students
begin to feel like they are
guinea pigs in a sleep
deprevation experiment.

Being made to jump through the
flaming hoop of exams is hard
enough, but having.one day to

breed a large degree of frustration
and cynicism.

The self-scheduled exam sys-
tem is, undeniably, a gift. It is

It is somewhat unorthodox
for an editor to reply to an article’
which appears in the same issue.
There are two reasons why I am
going bypass convention. The
first reason is that this is the last
issue of the semester. The second
is that Eric Sapp’s opinion petri-
‘| fied me; it pleads for refutation.
Sapp raises the question of
whether the campus Christmas.
party was asuitable venue for the
distribution of condoms. Had he
stopped there, for whatever rea-
son, I would have considered his
point valid, disagreed quietly and
moved on with editing.

Eric Sapp did not stop. He
writes that he is upset with the
fact that condoms were distrib-
uted at a tree-lighting ceremony.
In reading his article, it becomes
apparent that what he is against
is not the venue, but the fact of
condom distribution. Sapp makes
no mention of the.other ways in
which AIDS can be contracted.
Sharing needles, blood transfu-
sions and unprotected oral sex all
‘| contribute to the spread of AIDS.
It is amazing to me, that, at this
point in time, anyone would ques-
tion the centrality of condoms in
the fight against AIDS.

Mr. Sapp says, “Telling
people what they want to hear so
the AIDS awareness movement
will stay popular won’t solve the
problem.” Let’s break down this
sentence. Do you want to hear
about another person who is dy-
ing of AIDS? I, like so many
people, have had friends die as a
result of this disease. By defini-
tion there is nothing in the dis-
course about AIDS that anyone

- assume that he knows the solu-

right to object to the time and

wants to hear. But we have to
heat about AIDS so’ we under-
stand the implications of such a
disease. The implications for
us. AIDS is not a fad. It is not an
awareness movement. Sapp im-
plies there is some marketing
involved in keeping AIDS
awareness “popular.” The idea
that AIDS is something that
must be kept popular is repul-
sive. It is demeaning to those
infected, to the memory of those
who have died, and to those who
hold that memory dear.

Sapp then writes, “if we are
really serious about working
towards a solution to this prob-
lem [AIDS], we should consider
an alternative measure that is
clearly more effective than
condoms.” Sapp insinuates that
people are not serious about this
problem. Again, offensive. It is
highly presumptuous for him to

tion to the AIDS epidemic.
Highly-trained experts (like the
Center for Disease Control and
the National Institute of Health)
support education and condom
distribution as viable measures
to help in containing the AIDS
epidemic. It is not realistic to
demand, or even expect, mo-
nogamy of anyone.

I do not deny Eric Sapp his

place of condom distribution. I
question his knowledge about
the disease and the insidiously
political nature of his objec-
tions. The reason why we have
to earmark weeks for “aware-
ness” is because opinions like
Eric Sapp’s exist.

often, that these numbers mean
nothing tous now. If we stopped to
think about the actual amount of
time that goes into four papers:
and two tests we would be more
sympathetic. That’s why one read-
ing day isnot enough. Many people
are studying for three or four cu-

point of total prepared-
ness for all of your exams, you
must gauge which exams are more
important. By important I mean,
which exam will be the hardest, or
in which class you must do well on
the exam. The other exams suffer.
We learn to gauge our classes this
way at the end of the semester, and

of the academic gauge.

it is unfortunate that we do. I’ve
heard my peers refer to it as “stra-
tegic exam taking.” I would never
advocate giving us more days in
which to take exams, as I think that
the current system is very fair. I
would, however, implore the ad-
ministration to consider adding
reading days to the schedule. I
realize this could mean decreasing
class days or starting earlier in the
fall.. These are issues that can be
ironed out.

Giving us one day to getready
for the exam week, arguably one
of the most heinous and sleep de-
prived times in our young lives,
leaves many of us with a bad taste
in our mouthes.

Along with my classmates, I
will be gone after this May. How-
ever, Davidson is not getting any
easier. I realize it is almost impos-
sible to change a schedule already
in place, but for the sake of the
classes behind mine, the schedule
must change. Give us more read-
ing days.

A condom for all ...
and for all a good night. |

Some people were offended
when Santa interrupted a perfectly
wonderful tree lighting ceremony
by tossing condoms into the .
crowd on Tuesday night. I can re-
spect that.

These people are also very
prompt about voicing their dis-
pleasure, taking a student-signed
complaint and a condom to Presi-
dent Kuykendall on Wednesday

don’t like going to church -when
I’m home because I normally hear
alot about death, destruction, and
human depravation. I’m not big on
the three d’s, but as I was half-
listening to this sermon, the most
amazing thing happened. The mes-
sage changed.

“Sin is failure to do a con-
crete act of love.”

Those are the words I heard,

prevent the sexual transfer of the
virus. Those people are right. But
if you’re having sex (and many
people are), acondomis still better
than nothing at all.

But, the offended people
would go on. There is atime and a
place for condom distribution. It
can be done anonymously in col-
lege bathrooms. It can be done at
Health fairs or wherever, but the

morning. I applaud their
organizational skills and
their willingness to stand
for their beliefs, but Santa
deserves a little applause
as well.

For anyone that
missed the event, this is
what happened. Students

middle of the Christmas tree
lighting ceremony is nei-
ther the time nor the place.
Well, why not?

Much of the campus was
gathered there. It was asen-
sual, spiritual, loving event.
We were outside, holding
hands and singing songs
by candle-light. Maybe
there were young lovers in
the crowd, ° staring into

to start. Early in the festivities,

Santa made her appearance on the

. roof. Then she made the fateful

move. In honor of AIDS Aware-
ness week, a handful of Trojans
were sent floating down to the
crowd below.

After that, it was much like
any other tree lighting ceremony.
People singing, candles burning,
Christmas stories ringing in our
ears. And it was nice. We all
oohed and aahedas the lights came
on, and I left feeling warm and
fuzzy inside. It was not until the
next day that I noticed anything
might be wrong. I was eating din-
ner when I heard of the complaint
Dr. Kuykendall had received, and
realized that some people were of-
fended by Santa’s airborne gift.

But, I was never upset. Not in

ting in church with my family. I

and I couldn’t help but smile. It
was a message I could believe in.

Now, if you’! humor me fora
moment more, let me tell another
story.

Friday-night, I ended up talk-
ing in a friend’s room at 2 a.m.,
when he said, “You have to think
about the rules you’re given.” For
him, following rules blindly could
lead to a dangerous mentality
where people stop questioning
their actions. I think he’s right.

There was nothing unloving
about Santa dropping condoms
off the roof. In a lot of ways, she
was reaching out to the student
body.

“Here, if you’re loving some-
body, take precautions,” she could
have said.

Now, many of the offended
people will say thatcondoms don’t
prevent ADS; they don’t even
prevent pregnancy for certain.
Abstinence is the only sure way to

each others eyes over the final bars
of “Silent Night.” Maybe they raced
back to their room afterwards, and
maybe Santa reminded them to be
cautious.

I applaud Santa for that re-
minder. I applaud Santa for mak-
ing a statement about something
she believes in and for making me
laugh in the process.

And all the people who have
questioned what they believe and
still found themselves offended,
thanks for speaking up. Even if I
don’t agree with what you said. If
you want, call me (-6126) and we
can talk about what you found so
upsetting. Maybe we’ll both grow
from the experience.

But, if you were offended be-
cause you have always been told
such things are offensive, then I
urge you to question your re-
sponse. Find your own beliefs in-
stead of relying on everybody
else’s.
