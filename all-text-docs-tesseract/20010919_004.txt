Multiple alcohol-related citations, hospital visits.
prompt concern about freshman drinking

By Linpy BALDWIN

For many students, the prospect of going
off to college calls to mind a number of
tantalizing images — freedom from parents,
eating Doritos for breakfast, waking up at
12:20 for a 12:30 lecture. And, of course,

- wild college parties — at which everyone has
a great time amidst a constant flow of beer to
those over and under 21 alike.

Unfortunately, in the first month of the
Davidson school year, many students have
discovered an unpleasant flip side to that
image — police citations and trips to the hos-
pital.

At an off-campus party the weekend
before classes started, officers responding to
a noise complaint surprised a number of
Davidson students.
Despite a note from
Dean of Students
Tom Shandley re-

“All of these students were consuming
punch with excessive amounts of alcohol,”
Shandley stated, adding that there was no
information to suggest that more students had
made the trek to the emergency room.

Since that weekend, Shandley said, things
have been “normal, if not better than normal,”
and pointed to one of the most “incident-free”
First Nights Down in recent years.

In fact, there seems to be little indication
that the citations and hospital visits reflect a
dramatic increase in underage alcohol con-
sumption. Davidson President Bobby Vagt
frankly admitted, “I can’t say it’s particularly
disproportionate to other years.”

The increase seems not to be in Davidson
drinking, but in police response. Shandley
hypothesized that many students were “sur-
prised that the Town Police would actually

cite them,” but said,
“when you live off-
campus, you live by
the rules of the

According to
Shandley, 12
Davidson students
(not all of whom
were freshmen)

underage consumption of alcohol, and one
senior was arrested for disorderly conduct.
Furthermore, four students made trips to Lake
Norman Hospital. All four were, fortunately,
released within a few hours of being treated.

explained, adding
that when a student goes off-campus “the
school’s authority is limited.”

Technically, first-year students are-not al-

the definition of a “court-affiliated party” is,

according to one student, “very ambiguous.”
Many freshmen (for whom most other parties
are not an option) choose to give them the
benefit of the doubt.

Some students feel that upperclassmen do
little to clarify the issue. “There are a lot of
frats that deliberately invite freshmen girls to
off-campus
parties,” com-
mented one,
who asked to
remain anony-
mous.

“T think we
are very lucky,
and there are

off-campus
who are very
lucky, that they
did not get ar-
rested for dis-
tribution of alcohol to underage drinkers,
which is a serious offense in this state,” Vagt
said bluntly.

“One of my real disappointments is that
those citations and visits to the hospital were
functions of parties that occurred off-cam-
pus, where even if the underclassmen don’t
know better, the upperclassmen should.

“Maybe that’s too harsh, maybe upper-
classmen have no more responsibility, but I
like to think Davidson students look out for
each other.” ,

Shandley pointed out that students have to

.get permission to live off-campus. “Maybe

we need to review what’s involved in that
permission.”

A greater concern than misdemeanor cita-
tions is the possibility that someone might get

hurt as a result of careless drinking. Such
concerns are a key reason behind PE 101
sessions and the mandatory speeches all first-
years interested in the Court are required to
attend. “This is one of the areas that requires
lots of judgment on their part— on everyone’s
part — and that judgment doesn’t come built
in, always,” Vagt
said.

RLO also trains
hall counselors
extensively with
regard to alcohol
policy and safety.
Kristine
Harrington ’03 is
ahall counselor on
Second Little.
Harrington admits
that her “biggest
fear was facing an
alcohol problem. I
felt like I could
deal with everything else . . . a lot of experi-
mentation goes on in the first year, and we
just want to make sure everyone’s safe.”

Her training included extensive roleplaying
and “what ifs” to prepare hall counselors for
the possibility that their residents might need
to be cited — or worse, taken to the hospital.

There are also extensive efforts to explain
both the alcohol policy on-campus and pos-
sible off-campus consequences to all stu-
dents, especially freshmen. “I don’t think
anyone can plead ignorance,” Harrington said.

Shandley urged the student body to “be
vigilant about your own personal safety,” and
remember that a trip to the hospital is “by no
means the worst thing that could happen...
it’s not always a bad thing for students to get
medical attention.”
