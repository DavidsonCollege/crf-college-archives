Along the same line, Walt
MacDonald proposed that Da-
vidson poll 60 to 70 neighboring
colleges and ask both students
and faculty. to evaluate chapel
speakers and their topics. This
information would then be
compiled and distributed to col-
leges all over.

Spratt brought up the ques-
‘tion of books lost or stolen from

of the evening, Coffin answered
questions in such a way as to
give his views about why inte-
gration in every phase of public
fife was desirable to the Chris-
tian.. Hé also expressed strong
desires to see President Ken-
nedy’s Civil Rights Bill become
law. ;

He said no Christian could
live in the truth of the Absolute,
God, and practice discrimina-
tion. “If God loves all men
equally,” he argued, “it means
all men are of ' equal value.
Every man’s value is the same
in a basic Christian concept.
You can’t make distinctions that
God doesn't make.”

When asked about the prob-
lem of reconciling property
rights fo the rights of the
Negro, Coffin posed a ques-
tion of his own: “Should prop-
erty rigitts reject or deflect
human rights?”

He then gave an answer has-
ed on what he called a Christian
viewpoint of property. “We
Christians use- property sot as
a means of enhancing one’s
status over another but to facili-
tate human relationships.” he

said. “One can’t make an abso-
lute out of property rights. But
this is what Americans are so
hipped on. I think the Kennedy
administration’s program of
civil rights is extreme only to
an extreme property rights
man.”

Coffin was asked by a stud-
ent if he thought itewere pos-
sible for Congress to legislate
morality. “! think it's quite
true you can’t legislate atti-
tude or morality,” was the an-
swer. “But I think you can
legislate conditions that are
more conducive to morality,”
he added.

Coffin did say that he believ-
ed a civil rights law should only
apply to public places. “I don’t

Biblical Professor
Vespers Speaker

Dr. James Luther Mays, pro-
fessor of Biblical interpretation
at Union Theological Seminary
in Richmond, Va., will speak in
vespers Sunday night.

Mays was born in Louisville,
Ga.. on July 14, 1921. He receiv-
ed his BA from Erskine in 1942.
his BD from Union Theological
Seminary in Virginia in 1949,
and his PhD from Manchester
University, England, in 1957.

He had also attended Colum-
bia University and the Univer-
sity of Basel in Switzerland. He
was ordained by Lexington Pres-
bytery, Presbyterian Church.
U. S., in 1949.

Mays has served pastorates in
Steele’s Tavern, Va., and Lin-
colnton, N. C. He was in the
Air Force from 1942 to 1945 and
won the Air Medal. He joined
the faculty at Union Theological
Seminary in 1957.

October.

care where you practice dis-
crimination, it's morally wrong.
Even in private elubs. But 1
wouldn't care to see the law gi.
in there because it can do more
harm there.”

Coffin made the point that he
thought discrimination was an-
sther. form of idolatry. And as
he did the entire evening. he
used a laugh-drawing anecdote
to illustrate his view. He told
of a student from Glrana who

At 10:25 Coffin ended his in-|
formal chat with the rather:
large gathering still present by
injecting a note of gloom and a
hint of a warning: “I think we'll
be lucky.if we don’t have a ma-
jor Negro revolt.;It won’t hap-;
pen in North Carolina, but in
the major urban centers be-
cause it is compounded with
economic difficulties.” He in-

Lowder, new minister of the
Davidson Methodist Church.

He continued, “However, the
most controversial, without
doubt. will be the dramatized
conversation of a couple in a

uled the week preceding Home-
coming.”

Rey. Paul Lowder, successor
to Rev. Russell Montfort as pas-
tor of the Davidson Methodist

Church, is a native of Albemarle.
He attended Pfeiffer Junior

‘Announces MSF Programs

Mre his family’s coming to
Davidson, they resided in Con-
over where Lowder was pastor
of the First Methodist Church.

During the past several! years
Lowder has written numerous
articles for magazines and news-
papers. These literary efforts
have culminated in a new vol-
ame, published this spring by
the Upper Room, entitled Let
Us Pray. While primarily de-
signed for ministers. the book
is of value to the general public.

In addition to the two provo-
eative programs already men-
tioned. Lowder said that the
MSF, under the leadership of
President Steve Gramley, has
scheduled other interesting fall
programs.

The first program. held to-
night, is a quiz “What Do You
Believe?” This quiz is taken
from Motive magazine and en-
ables the student to classify
himself in any category from
Humanist to Neo-Orthodox.

increased.

During the past three years,’
5% per cent of the returning
student body transferred or
roughly 36 students. With a
larger student body, the number
of drop-outs at 5% per cent!
comes to 42 students. ;

Actually, 54 students dropped
out of Davidson this year, 7 per
cent of the upperclassmen, 12
more students than predicted,
and an increase of 1% per cent. |

Dean of Students Richard C.,
Burts said that dropouts had |
“never been a serious problem.” |
Burts added that a mew regula-
tion was a significant factor in
the increase of drop-outs.

“If a student has not graduat-
ed in four full years at David-
son, he can not come back dur-
ing the fail semester but has to
wait until either spring semes-
ter or summer school.” Burts
could attribute at least 5 drop-
outs to this new factor.

H. Edmonds White, assistant
director of admissions, con-
firmed that a few more students
than usual had dropped out for’
one reason or another. He ex-
pressed concern over the prob-
lem but explained. “This hap.
pens on every college campus.”

White added, “I think our
percentage of drop-outs is ex-
cellent compared with other

| good colleges and their percent-

age of return.”

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH,
DEAR FRIENDS

Today I begin my tenth year of writing this column in your
campus newspaper. Ten years is a long tite; it is, in facl, what
some scholarly people like to call a decade—from the Latin
word deccum, meaning the floor of a ship. It is, to my mind,
remarkable that the Romans had such s word as deccum when
you consider that ships did not exist until 1620 when John
Alden invented the Mayflower. Alden, a prodigiously ingenious
man, also invented the ear lobe and Pocahontas.

Ships were a very popular mode of travel—especially over
water —until 1912 when the Swede, Ivar Krueger, invented the
iceberg. Krueger also invented the match, which is 8 goud
thing, because without the match, how would you light your
Marlboro Cigarettes? I cannot overstress the isnportance of
lighting your Mariboro Cigarettes, for Marlboro Cigarettes,
unlighted, provide, at best, only limited smoking picasure.

I mention Marlboros because this column is an advertise-
ment, brought to you through the school year by the makers
of Marlboros. Marlboros come in soft pack or Flip-Top box.
The makers of Marlboros come in dark suits with thin lapels

—except on weekends when they come in yoke-neck jerseys
and white duck trousers. White ducks come.in flocks. They are
primarily fresh water dwellers, although they have been suc=
cessfully raised in salt water too. Another salt water denizen
I’m sure you will find enjoyable is plankton—a mess of tiny
organisms like diatoms and algae and like that which float
sluggishly near the surface of the sea. It is ironic that chese
creatures, microscopic in size, should supply the principal
source of food for the earth’s largest animal, the whale. Whales,
I must say, are not at all pleased with this arrangement, be-
cause it takes the average whale, eating steadily, 48 hours to
gather a day’s meal. This leaves them almost no time for
water sports or reading Melville. It is a lucky thing for all of
us that whales are unaware they are mammals, not fish, and
could, if they tried, live just as well on land as in water. I
mean, you add ten or twelve million whales to our Sunday
traffic and you would have congestion that makes the mind
ggle.

But I digress. Today, I was saying, I begin my tenth year
writing this column for Marlboro Cigarettes io your pai
‘newspaper. I will, in each column, say a few kind words about
Marlboros—just as you will, once you try that fine tobacco
flavor, that pristine white filter, that supple soft pack, that
‘jafrangible Flip-Top box. Theee references to Mariboro will be
brief and unobtrusive, for I do not believe in the hard pell
What I favor is the soft sell—you might even call it the limp
or spongy sell. I hasten to state that the makers of Marlboro
in ten full years have not onee complained about my desultory
aales approach. Neither have they paid me.

But that is of mall consequence. Aside from fleeting mentions
of Marlboro, this column has another, and more urgent, mission:
to cast the hot white light of free inquiry upon the vexing
questions that trouble college America—questions like “Should
the Student Council have the power to levy tariffs? and “Are
roommates sanitary?” and “Should housemothers be com-
pelled to retire upon reaching the age of 26?”

Perhape, reasoning together, we can find the answers. Per-
haps not. But if we fail, let it never be said that it was for
want of trying.

I thank you.
