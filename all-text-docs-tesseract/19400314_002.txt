_One of these six men will be recognized.
He' will be elected to the editorship and re-
tinction that goes with the office. The
outside world know that they too played
an important part in making out this paper.

Theirs ‘is a thankless job the most
thankless on the campus.

It's hard-to see five men like this, each
reaching a piace aiter three vears of labor,
that qualities them each for a better place,
Taere should _be some other_
way.to show our appreciation to them than
_to_add theit name to the list of associate

But if the third-rate student speaks the
truth, it is just that mueh more to the
credit of tne honored boys. It is an admis-
sion that they have the intetlectual and
physical stamina to keep at it, despite
temptations in the guise of shows and
bulling and weck-ends, which. are- just as
‘strong ior them as ior the playboy.

Mathematics tells the story of Phi Beta
Kappa. But it doesn’t tell the whole tale
of these exceptional students.

It doesn’t reveal what it takes to spend
an afternoon practicing for track or ten-

legs and head slumping forward on shoul-

ders, to force tired eyelids to keep open_|

while they encounter the boresome trivia
that are inevitable some time in every
competent job of hitting the books.
