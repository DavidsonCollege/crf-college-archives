HIGH SCHOOL NOTES.

The local foot ball team met and
defeated the Statesville aggregation last
Saturday by score of 7-0. The High
School line-up contained a few college
students, which fact, however, was offset
bv Statesville “ringers” being allowed to
play. A game is soon to be played with
the Highs of Winston-Salem. No defi-
nite date as yet has been scheduled.

e

Miss Anne Payne, who was one of
the teachers in the High School last
year, paid the school a pleasant visit
while she was in Davidson.

any man who is undecided about any
problem of life or his life’s work. To
facilitate the arrangement of these in-
terviws, each leader has been assigned a
who will arrange
dates for him, and make out his sched-
ule. Those desiring interviews are
urged to see these secretaries. Through
the courtesy of those who control them,
Dr. Richards’ study and the Kappa Al-
pha, Kappa Sigma, and Pi Kappa Alpha
halls have been secured for these inter-
views, to insure absolute privacy, and
during this period these halls will be
used only for Y. M. C. A. purposes.

The list of leaders granting inter-
views, and their secretaries, is as fol-
lows: Dr. Chapman, W. G. Somer-
ville, secretary; Mr. Alexander, J. G.
Patton, secretarv; Dr. Rolston, W. A.
Dumas, secretary; Mr. Brown, T. J.
Mitchell, secretary; Mr. Pharr, A. B.
Reese, secretary.
_ The services are to end on Thursday
night, and the brevity of the campaign
makes it desirable that every man at-
tend every meeting.

Fellows, let's be there!
