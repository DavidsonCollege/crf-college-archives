Fraternity Evaluation Committee Reports

Chairman Reports

The following represents
the report of the Frater-
nity Evaluation Committee,
which, I, as Student Body
President, was authorized in
November, 1964 to appoint
and chair in order to in-
quire into criticisms made
of the social system at Da-
vidson and to attempt spe-
cific remedial recommenda-
tions.

The membership of the Com-
mittee reflects an effort to view
fairly the problems of the fra-
ternity system from several ap-
propriate perspectives. The com-
mittee is composed of five un-
dergraduate fraternity men, in-
cluding the President of the In-
terfraternity Council; three in-
dependents, including the Presi-
dent of Lingle Manor; and four
faculty-administration members,
including the immediate past
and present Fraternity Liaison
Officers.

This Committee has officially
met nineteen times since it be-
gan its work on December 10,
‘1964. A tremendous amount of
time and energy has since gone
into the work of the group and
into the compilation of this re-
port. Several avenues have been
taken by the Committee in an
effort to approach a realistic an-
swer to the query, ‘‘Are the
fraternities serving the needs of
Davidson College and its stu-
dents, and are there specific
steps that might be taken to bet-
ter serve these needs?"

Questionnaires sent out have
polled the opinions of Davidson
student leaders of the past ten
years, as well as representative
independents of the same peri-
od. The present fraternity sys-
tems ‘and social situations at
other schools, especially those
similar in nature to Davidson,
have been examined. Students,
faculty, and administration
personnel at Davidson have
submitted their personal state-
ments on the fraternity system
for the Committee’s study.

Tn our attempt to find answers
to the problems of the social
system, primary emphasis has
been placed on personal :nter-
views by the Committee with
those persons who are _ inter-
ested in and knowledgeable of
the problems and strengths re-
lated to our fraternity system.
A goodly number of the faculty,
administration,. and student
body have appeared before the
Committee, as well as rep-
resentatives of other schools
and of national fraternities.

An attempt has been made, of
course, to assimilate all this in-
formation into some accurate
appraisals of our situation and
some equally realistic recom-
mendations for action to im-
prove this situation.

disproportionate role in the
organization of student so-
cial life and that this role
should be substantially al-
tered.

While no single alternate
plan of organization has
been supported by every
member of the Committee,
the one which follows was
agreed upon by the major-
ity.

Not only do we believe
that this plan promises to
remedy current problems,
but we also believe it is in
itself a desirable form of
organization. We recognize,
at the same time, that any
steps in the direction out-
lined herein will produce
new circumstances which
may indicate that the goal
we have proposed should be
pursued more _ actively,
should be modified, or
should be replaced by a new
one.

Therefore, we recom-
mend at the end of the re-
port that along with other
immediate steps which
should be taken, a perman-
ent Social Life Evaluation
Committee should continue
this work. Whatever that
committee may decide, we
ourselves, having spent sev-
eral months in deliberation,
are convinced that it is wise
and appropriate to begin
these reforms now.

PREMISE

The establishment of David-
son College gave concrete ex-
pression to the hopes of its
founders that the democratic
and Christian pattern of life
would be perpetuated by those
who studied here.

In the words of the Statement
of Purpose, Davidson seeks to
“nurture the whole man," ‘'to
develop men of humane in-
atinets, of disciplined and cre-
ative minds and of Christian
character.'’ Its educational as-
pirations, therefore, go beyond
the classroom to include as
legitimate to its interests the so-
cial, physical and moral ma-
turation of the student.

Therefore, we believe it ap-
propriate to adopt as the basic
premise of this inquiry the fol-
lowing:

That the formal aspects
of the organization of sut-
dent social life, broadly con-
ceived, should be at ail
polnts in accord with the
Christian, democratic and
educational aspirations of
Davidson College.

To do less than apply this
criterion to the matter assigned
to us, namely the evaluation of
the fraternity system, would be
failing to be true to that which
is most worthy and most es-
sential in the traditions of the
college.

If we had not applied it we

On certain basic points and could at best propose temporiz-

problems of our study, the Com-
mittee itself has been sharply
divided on both philosophic ori-
entation and practical propos-
als. The evidence of both agree-.
ment and disagreement is ob-
vious ‘in the Committee state-
ment and minority statements
which comprise this total report
of the Committee’s study.

As Chairman of this Commit-
tee, I do not have the power to.
vote on proposals before the
Committee except in the case of
a tie vote on an issue. However,
I do feel it necessary to com-
ment in this statement that I am
essentially in agreement with
the opinions and stands of the
minority report of Council, Kel-
ton, Ross, and Terry. I do not -
agree with the Committee re-
port's apparent conclusion that
elimination of the fraternity sys-
tem per se at Davidson is the
best possible solution for cor-
recting the deficiencies in our
social situation. I hold rather
that relatively moderate changes
plus continued evaluation of the
fraternity system, its faults and
merits, will best achieve the
ends that are the ultimate goal
of this repopt.

It is hoped that the material
contained in this report will pro-
vide stimulation, insight, and in-
formation in working toward the
best social environment for Da-
vidson in its continued growth
as an outstanding educational
institution.

Student Body President

Commitee Speaks

PREFACE

The Fraternity Evalua-
tion Committee, having
studied at length the prob-
lems involved with the fra-
ternity system as presently
constituted, has concluded
that the fraternities have
assumed a paramount and

ing expedients which would deal
with the symptoms rather than
the cause of the present malady.

PROBLEM

The evidence we have ac-
cumulated has forced us to con-
clude that the organization of
student social life at Davidson
under the fraternity system as
it now exists is a serious ob-
stacle to the realization of the
premise. We do not question the
fact that these groups have. of-
ten benefitted the program of
the College by providing their
members opportunities for the
assumption of responsibility, for
self-discipline, and for social
adiustment.

Moreover, we believe that the
ideals upon which the frater-
nities have been established and
the loyalty to the College which
they have fostered have. been
of real value. Nevertheless, we
believe that the fraternities have
also had negative effects of suf-
ficient consequence to compro-
mise the premise above in a
fundamental way. The following
items describe in general terms
several points at which this is
apparent:

1. Within the aspirations of

the College It is reason-

able to expect that each
student should be able to
seek and to find a form
of social expression with-
out being embarrassed or
handicapped by instltu-
fonalized criteria of so-
clat acceptability which
are neither germane to
nor consistent with the

Christian, democratic, or

educational goals of the

College.

. Within the aspirations of
the College it is reason-
able to expect that each
student should be able to
pursue his education with-
out being distracted by in-
flunces which place in-
appropriate emphasis on
conformity to peer group

norms and which thereby

make undue demands on

time, Interests and ef-
fort.

3. Within the aspirations of
the College it is reason-
able to expect that each
student should be free to
determine his own friends
and associates, nelther
being compelied to aban-
don this freedom to oth-
ers nor depriving others
of its opportunities.

. Within the aspirations of
the College it is reason-
able to expect that so long
as fraternity membership
is determined by the tra-
ditional blackball meth-
od (a procedure designed
for » small voluntary and
closely - knit group), the
fraternity rote should be
limited to that in which
the blackball was or-
iginally felt to be ap-
propriate.

Whatever the fraternity sys-
tem may have been in former
times, it is well known to all
those familjar with student life
at Davidson now that it has be-
come the basis for a clearly de-
fined system of arbitrary bar-
riers. These barriers structure
a social. system in which there
is inequitable distribution of so-
cial privilege and esteem.

Those who arrive as Freshmen
with a certain degree of social
sophistication usually manage to
negotiate the perils of Rush
Week successfully. This success,
made concrete in pledging a
fraternity, ushers them into a
position of social privilege.

Those who are not successful
and do not receive any bids are
the outcasts at Davidson. They
are rejected by the fraternities
and in many ways by the college
as well.

At the deepest probing of our
inquiry, it has become evident
that the fundamental question
which we face is this: should
such a system dominate the so-
cial relationships of the student
body? Given the Christian,
democratic and _ educational
ideals of the college, the answer
is clear.

Such a system js contrary to
any Christian or democratic so-
cial ethic. At the present time
the democratic and Christian
pattern of life which is com-
mended in the classroom and
preached from the pulpit .is
ignored as a practical possibil-
ity in the social organization of
student life.

This issue will not be met, we
believe, simply by changing the
time when a student joins a fra-
ternity. A delayed rush could
indeed soften the blow of re-
jection, but rejection is only one
symptom of the basic issue.

Total opportunity bidding has
also been suggested aS a means
of solving the problem of re-
jection, but, in addition to avoid
ing the real issue. its adoption
would result in the loss of a
number of charters from the
national fraternities. Other mea-
sures, we determined, are need.
ed.

While we recognize the prob
lems of students who are not
a part of Davidson's main so-
cial system, we also feel that
an equally large problem is the
effect on those who are mem-
bes of the system.

In the first place, we feel that
the current fraternity system at
Davidson has come to play a
disproportionate part in the
life of the student; that entirely
too much energy is used in
rushing and pledge training as
a means of perpetuating the fra-
ternities: that too much time
and interest is consumed in fra-
ternity affairs; and that a
healthier atmosphere would be
one in which more of a stu.
dent's time is spent both in
social relationships that are
more diverse and dynamic and
personal pursuits that are more
substantial.

The bdlackball system as a
means of membership selection
tends to produce a restrictive
homogeneity among members.
It has been noted that certain
fraternities go for long periods
of time with no members in-
volved in certain curricular and
extracurricular activities on the
campus.

The Committee strongly be-
lieves that in an area which
dominates such a_ significant
portion of the student's life (eat-
ing and recreation), less bind-
ing group membership would
better provide for the attain-
ment of the educational goals of
the College.

In the second place, we are
concerned with a fraternity's
effect on the individual's free-
dom to choose his own friends
and associates. On the one hand,
so much time is spent at the
fraternity house that the mem-
ber's circle of friends tends to
be drawn for the most part

from the fraternity.

This group, however, {fs one
from which any individual mem-
ber can exclude a_ potential
member, but one in which that
member has little real controt
as to who will be included. This
belies the argument that fra-
ternities preserve freedom of
association since they actually
curtail that freedom. In prac-
tice they institutionalize an in-
dividual’s freedom to reject
another , with the not infre-
quent effect of trapping a per-
son in a group into which he
cannot bring his friends.

On the other hand, the fi-
nancial necessities of operating
a boarding house force the fra-
ternities to maintain such a
size that their original purpose,
to embody a small, voluntary
and closely-knit brotherhood, is
defeated.

Although this Committee has
no authority of its own to ef-
fect any changes in Davidson's
social structure, we feel that it
is appropriate to our task
not only to evaluate the fratern-
ity situation as it exists today,
but also. to outline what can be
done to organize social life more
suitably.

A fundamental reform is
called for if social life at David-
son is to contribute to the goals
of the College and to the needs
of its students. An. outline of
this structural reform is given
below.

_ We would point out that this
Committee has not happened
upon these insights alone. In
1960 the issues were recognized
when several student body lead-
ers ‘resigned from their fra-
ternities in conscientious protest.

Of the 23 student body lead-
ers of the last decade who
answered the Committee's in-
quiry on the fraternity system,
65% indicated that they would
favor a total opportunity bidding
system. (While not currently a
concern of the Commitee, total
opportunity was an early pro-
posal designed to remove the
inequities in the present sys-
tem.)

The restiveness of a number
of students and faculty. with the
present system has been shown
in letters to the Committee and

to THE DAVIDSONIAN.

PROPOSED SOLUTION

At Davidson it has long been
the custom to think of the na-
ture and benefits of social
groups in terms of the tradition-
al model provided by the fra
ternities. While we believe the
distinct advantages of small
groups at Davidson should be
maintained -indeed that oppor-
tunity for membership should be
given all students—we do not
believe that the fraternity model
is the only one under which.
such groups can be successfully
and. beneficially organized. In
an attempt to provide a struc-
ture of student social organiza-
tion which would include small
social groups and embody, at

‘the same time, the initial pre-

mise. the Committee. has thor-
oughly discussed and criticized
the following proposal. The ma-
jority supports it.as the solution
toward which to work.

1. That each freshman class

eat together for the entire
year without formal re-
tationships to upper class
social organizations; that
their intramural athletic
competition be organized
around dormitory divis-
jons; that an administra-
tive staff member be
employed whose chief re-
sponsibilities would be to
work with the members
of the freshman class in
the interests of a better
transition to college life
and college pursuits.

2 That the members of the
three upper classes eat
in Club Houses, current-
ly occupied by the sev-
eral fraternifies, The
membership of the Clubs
would be determined sole-
ly by individual choice,
limited only by the capac-
ity of the houses and the
requirements of equitable

and orderly = setection.
(See paragraph three un-
der “Transition Steps.’’)
. That the recreation, social
life and intramural com-
petition of the upper
classes be organized
around the Clubs, which
will separately devise
their own means of self-
government.
That campus-wide social
events be planned by a
Social Council, represent-
ing alt students. Each
would contribute fo the
budget of the Council
through a social fee as-
sessed by the College.
5. That the original concep-
tion of a fraternity, as a
small company of like-
_ minded individuals who
support common purposes
and who wish to foster
closer ties among them-
selves, be restored by lim-
iting membership to the
junior and senior classes.
Members would be select-
ed in a manner consist-
ent with the fraternities’
traditional constitutions,
so tong as any Davidson
student was officially
eligible for initiation, and
selection would represent
a. distinction based both
on the merit of the man
and of the fraternity as
mutually recognized by
each.

TRANSITION STEPS

A prime virtue of this pro
posal is that its reatization is
possible within the existing fa-
cilities and organizations of the
College. The period of transition
would doubtless present prob-
lems, as may be expected of any
period of social adjustment, but
with firm and confident ‘leader.
ship the transition could be

4

made reasonably smooth and
without interrupting the prog-
ress of the College.

As a matter of general policy,
in order to. insure maximum
flexibility and student initiative
within the broad guide lines of
the proposal, as much self-de-
termination and _ leadership
would be left to the Clubs and
student governing organizations
as feasible. With this in mind,
the following minimum  con-
ditions would be necessary to
insure the successful implemen-
tation of the proposal.

1. Beginning with the class
of 1969, a student would
not pledge a Greek letter
social fraternity until af-
ter Spring vacation of
his sophomore year, nor
would Initiation follow un-
til some convenient time
after the beginning of his
junior year. Rushing
would be on an informal
basis. Those in classes
prior to 1969 could be
rushed and pledged at any
time seen fit by the fra-
ternities,

2. The Club identity of a
house would be assumed
in the fall of 1966 for the
purpose of intramural
athletics and the like. The
fraternities would con-
tinue to use their pres-
ent chapter rooms as
meeting places, but to
prevent domination of a
Club by any given fra-
fernity, some limit would
be set as fo any one fra-
fernity’s representation in
any Club-—-this limit to
become effective in the
fall of 1967.

3. Beginning with the aca-
demic year 1966-1967, any
uppercilassman could
choose to eat with any
Club he desired with the
following provisos:

a. Any student eating in
a house during the
previous semester
could exercise an op-
tlon to remain in that
house for the following
year.

. The capacity of each
house would be set
at some reasonable
number; when that
many persons had se-
lected a given Club,
no additional mem-

bers would be al-
lowed.
c. All eligible students

who desired to choose
a Club, whether they
were members of the
rising sophomore
class or were upper-
classmen who desired
to be with a new Club,
would be assigned a
number at random to
determine the order
in which the selection
of Clubs would be
made.

. A small group of in-
dividuais could de-
termine to form a
bloc and join a Club

together; their po-
sition In the order of
selection would be

given to the group

rather than to the
individuals separate-

ly.
4. In the fall of 1966 the
current Housing Fee

would be charged of all
Club members. In ad-
dition, a Maintenance Fee
would be assessed and
credited to the account
of the Club In which the
individual was a mem-
ber. This account would
provide funds for new
decorations and furnish-
ings in the Club’s house.
in order to assure equit-
able financial benefits, a
common celling would be
set by the Clubs for the
combined boarding and
social fee.

(MMEDIATE
RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommenda-
tions cover the initial actions
necessary to implement the a-
vove proposal. They could lead
to other organizational arrange-
ments as well. A substantial
majority of the Committee
think that these steps should
be taken before, the end of the

current academic year.

1. We recommend that no

member of the class of

1969 may pledge himself

to a national Greek letter

social fraternity during

the academic_year 1966.

1966.

We recommend that the

_members of the class of

1969 eat in the College

Union during the acade-

mic yeer 1965-1966.

We recommend that the

Administration immediate-

ly secure en additional

staff member to serve as

Assistant to the Dean of

Students for Freshman Af-

fairs beginning in the fall

of 1965.

4. We recommend that the
Student Council, through
Its proper constitutional
procedures, make provis-
ion for a campus-wide
Social Council which
would assume the respon-
sibility, currently borne
by the  Interfraternity
“Council, for planning
campus. dances and con-
certs.

5. We recommend (a) an
increase in the General
Fee to provide income
for the budget of the
Social Council and for
an increase in Union ac-
tivities, and (b) an addi-
tional fee to be assessed
of all freshmen to pro-
vide for an expanded fresh-
man social program (this
fee would be in lieu of
fraternity fees which
would otherwise be asses-
ed from the majority of
the freshman class).

We recommend that fresh-

men who have attained a

1.5 average during any

grading period be able

to keep an automobile at

Davidson so long as that

average is maintained at

subsequent grading per-
iods. Arrangements would
be necessary to keep these

oo
by

6

automobiles from faxing
the parking facilities used
by upperclassmen.

We recommend that the
College provide regular
bus transportation to main
locations in Charlotte on
Saturday evenings and on
other occasions when the
need exists. ,

We recommend that all
national Greek letter social
fraternities give official
satisfaction that all Dav-
idson students working to-
werd @ degree are eligl-
ble for initiation, and that
any fraternity failing to
Provide such satisfection
by September 1, 1966, be
removed from the cam-
pus.

. We recommend that the
Student Council authorize a
standing Sociat Life Eval-
uation Committee, repre-
senting a cross section
of the student body, with
representatives from the
staff and faculty, to
continue the work of this
present Committee, to
evaluate the progress -to-
ward the realization of the
proposal, and to recom-
mend whatever further
implementation of these
recommendations seems
necessary. In the interests
of continuity this Commit-
fee suggests that its pre-
sent members be invited
to serve on the succeeding
Committee if they are pre-
sent at the College during
the next academic year.

CONCLUSION

In dealing with the fraternity
system we have been aware of
the fact that the attachment of
many alumni and students to
the fraternities as they are now
constituted is sincere and deep.
Indeed it is for this reason that
we have felt the proposal simply
to abolish fraternities unwar-
ranted, for the fraternities have
served the College well-in many
ways for many years.

Our belief that a fundamental
realignment of campus social
structures is desirable is based
on the conviction that such a
step is in accord with the con-
tinued realization of the goals
of the College. Many will feel
that Davidson will not be the
same with the social structure
we envision.

Yet, change in the best inter-
ests of the purposes and edu-
cational program of the Col-
lege will, we believe, reteive the
warm support of the vast maj-
ority of students, staff and
alumni, even as they have sup-
ported changes and progress in
the spheres of their own activ-
ities.

In offering our criticisms of
the present social system at
Davidson, we would make clear
that it is not our desire to make
a bad Davidson good, but -to
make a good Davidson better
With all others of good will, we
would see the College move ac-
cording to its ‘‘vision of excel-
lence in the field of Christian
higher education.”

Quartet Presents Minority Statement ©

A MINORITY REPORT

We, the undersigned mem-
bers of the Fraternity Eval-
ulation Committee, agree in
many ways with the report
of the conimittee. We agree
with the immediate recom-
mendations and wish to
emphasie our support for
these measures.

Our primary disagreement
with the committee report is
on the proposed solution, for
though it is a possible solution
with a great deal to recom-
mend it, we do not fee] that
it offers the best possible ap-
proach given the system that
exists at present. We are
anxious that drastic and per-
manent changes in the pre-
sent system not be made until
more moderate reform is
tried.

Therefore, we urge the
adoption of the immediate pro-
posals without a commitment
to the goals of the proposed
solution.

Though we recognize that
there are many problems with
the present system, we are
not convinced that the cause
is fraternities, per se. In our
opinion, fraternities are neith-
er necessarily nor entirely bad,
and since constructive changes
are possible, opportunities for
such changes should be offer-
ed.
It appears to us that the ma-

jor shortcomings of our present
system stem from two basic
conditions:

(1) At present, the fraternity
system dominates, with col-
lege support, many aspects of
campus life. As a consequence,
few alternatives to the system
are available to students. This
domination is evident in the
focusing of campus attention
on “rush week’ at the begin-
ning of the school year, the
dependence of the campus on
IFC for the organization of
major concerts and dances,
and the absence of small-
group eating and social facil-
ities for those not in fraterni-
ties.

(2) Certain characteristics
of the fraternities themselves
work to the detriment of stu-
dents within the system and
without. {n particular, their
restrictive membership prac-
tices automatically reject cer-
tain Davidson students on the
basis of race or religion in
contradiction to the conviction
expressed by faculty action of
the past year.

If this analysis is correct, it
may be unnecessary to elimi-
nate fraternities or to change
their functions in the drastic
ways proposed in the committee
report. The effort should be
made to reduce the importance
of fraternities and to eliminate
their discriminatory practices.

The immediate recommenda-
tions take large steps in these

directions. Within the next year
it may become apparent that
further changes are needed; if
so, the continuing committee
will be in a better position to
judge this than we are at this
time. We feel that too detailed
a structuring of the steps to be
taken a year or so from now
is premature,

In attaching a proposed solu-
tion, we offer a possibility not
presented in the committee re-
port. This proposal should not
be decided upon now as the final
solution, but rather should be
kept before the continuing eval-
uation committee for further
consideration.

We feel that steps taken in the
direction of this proposal are
more feasible and desirable in
light of the present social facil-
ities and situation than are the
radical steps outlined in the com-
mittee report.

Proposed Solution:

1. Each freshman class will
eat together as a unit but
without any formal relation-
ship to the social organizations
on campus. We also urge that
a soclal program be set up
for freshmen and that intra-
mural competition be organ-
ized around dormitory divi-
sions.

2. Any group desiring to
form an esting club, with
membership requirements be-
ing nondiscriminatory as te

race and religion, and an Invi-
tation for membership requir-

ing approval of no more than
one-half of the members shall
be allowed fo do so. The col-
lege would be responsible for
providing such a group with
facitities comparable to those
enjoyed by other social organ-
izations.

3. All national fraternities
shall nelther rush nor pledge
any member of a freshman
class. Eating clubs organized
as outlined in No. 2 shail be
allowed to rush and board any
freshman having a 1.0 aver-
age for the previous semester.
(This would allow eating clubs
fo take second semester fresh-
men having a 1.0).

4. All social organizations
must sign a statement that
they do not officially discrim-
inate as to race or religion
in the selection of their mem-
bers. All national fraternities
must submit a statement sign-
ed by their national president
to this effect. Such statement
will be required prior to Sep-
tember 1, 1966.

5. Campus-wide soclal events
shall be planned by a Soclal
Council, representing fraterni-
ties, eating clubs, independ-
ents and freshmen. All stu-
dents would contribute to the
budget of said council through
a social fee assessed by the
college.

6. No social organization
having less than 40 members
for two consecullve semesters

shall be allowed to occupy a
house on Patterson Court.

7. Lingle Manor shal! con-
tinue to oporate with open
membership. Freshmen may
affiliate at the end of the first
semester. Lingle Manor should
be given boarding facilities as
soon as financially feasible.

8. Realizing that sophomore
rush presents unique prob-
lems, we recommend the IFC
draw up rules allowing maxi-
mum contact between fresh-
men and upper classmen, but
minimum opportunity for rush-
ing.

We urge the fraternities to be
forward looking, hoping that
they will realize that this pro-
posal is not aimed at the elimi-
nation of a fraternity system,
but rather the creation of a
more equitable social system at
Davidson.

While the proposals offered in
this report involve radical
changes in the current social
system, we feel that the creation
of a system of national frater-
nities and competitive eating
clubs will make Davidson more
acceptable to prospective stu-
dents, alleviate many of the ar-
tificial barriers that now exist,
and in general provide a social
system that serves the needs of
the whole student body.
