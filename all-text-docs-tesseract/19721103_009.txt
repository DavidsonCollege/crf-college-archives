Ingold, Webel Lead
Cat Ground Game

Team depth is a big factor in
winning football games,
especially late in the season.

The Bucknell Homecoming
contest proved that Davidson's
Wildcats have that depth at
running back.

David Ingold has had an
outstanding season thus far.

After six games, Ingold had
amassed a total of 853 all-
purpose yards, which includes
rushing, pass receiving and
returns.

That boils down to an average
of 142.2 per game, good enough
for a ranking of 15th in the
NCAA in that category.

Some 283 of those yards came
against Furman in a
performance that netted him
Southern Conference Offensive
Player-of-the-Week honors.

Besides these
accomplishments Dave has
been among the conference
rushing leaders all season.

But Ingold has been bothered
with pulled ligaments in his
right foot and was forced to
miss the Homecoming contest.

John Webel had _ been
heralded in the preseason as a
player to watch in such a
prestigious annual as ‘Street
and Smith's College Football
Yearbook."

But Webel has also had a bout
with the injury jinx. His
problem has been a bad ankle

which has. for several weeks.
severely limited his mobility.

Webel replaced Ingold with a
strong performance in the
Homecoming victory, an effort
which is almost certain to
guarantee him some playing
time during the remainder of
the season.

“Personally, I've had a
disappointing season,’ Webel
commented. ‘Dave (Ingold)

has had a great vear and |
haven't done the job I'm
capable of doing. But it really
feels great to be back.

“I'm looking forward to the
remaining games. I think we've
got a real good shot at the
conference championship if we
can get past William and
Mary.” he added.

David Ingold is also eyeing
those final contests.

“I'm planning to play this
Saturday.” he said. **] guess it’s
hard to tell how my foot will
respond, but it feels better and I
should be ready.”

Dave also had some
comments on his play this
season. **Possibly I've

surprised some people this fall.
but I really haven't done as well
as I had ‘hoped to do. I don't
think I really hit good form until
the Appalachian State game.”
If Ingold’s optimism
concerning his physical status
is justified, he and Webel could

spell double trouble for
Davidson's last three
opponents, all Southern

Conference foes.

aggressive. But more than that,
they must work together as a
unit, not as individuals for
personal glory. And_ the
lubricant: a simple matter of
leadership from one or two
players on the field.

That is what Bob Mosketti,
defensive coordinator for the
Wildcats, attributed to the Cats
success in defense recently.

‘“We have learned to help one
another and be happy for each
other ,"’ he said. *‘We get excited
playing the game. It makes up
for our lack of size and speed in
some departments.”

Mosketti singled out Captain
Woody Montgomery for giving
the large amount of leadership
and guidance from the
experienced side.

“Woody is our
defense," he said.
really helped out
younger players.”

He also tabbed Bill Garrett,
Jim Hardison and Mike
Creasman for pulling and
knitting the unit together.

‘With the youth we have it is
vital to our team defense to
have this excellent type of
leadership.” Mosketti
explained.

The front eight of the
Wildcats is the group which has
progressed ‘‘with leaps and
bounds."’ according to Mosketti.

‘We are becoming more and
more vicious. Our tackles “are
becoming surer all the time. We
can attribute’ that to
experience. The teams we are
playing are not moving the ball
nearly as well as they did," he
added.

The weakest part of the
defense is the secondary. **We
still have a long way to go

leader on

with our

there," said Mosketti. ‘But
moving Eddie Womack back to
safety has helped us

tremendously. We do not have a
senior in the secondary."

Mosketti has been extremely
well pleased with freshmen
starters Jim DeVille and Roger
Whitley.

“Eddie Williamson is a real
aggressive guy who is always
around the ball.’ praised

Cats Upset Bisons
25-21 As Defense,
Aerial Attack Shine

By JIM SITTERSON
Assistant Sports Editor

“If there is such a thing as a
turning point in a football game,
it came in the first two minutes
when we stopped Bucknell with
a goal line stand.”’

This was head coach Dave
Fagg's analysis of Saturday's
game when the Wildcats
surprised Bucknell 25-21.

The key to the victory was
the defense according to Fagg.

“It was one of the finest
defensive games ever turned in
by a Davidson team,” he said.

Fagg presented defensive
coach Bob Mosketti with a
game ball following the upset.

“It was a way to show him
and those defenders what a fine
job they did," said Fagg.

The offense, although riddled
with injuries, also had a good
day. The attack was sparked by
the passing of Scotty Shipp.

Machine Succeeds

Mosketti. ‘‘He really shows a lot
of team desire and
determination."

The size of the opposition has
been a problem all season for
the Wildcats. Mosketti does not
know of a team that Davidson
has played so far that is smaller
than the Cats.

“We gave up 20 pounds per
man against Bucknell,” he
laughed. *‘But against William
and Mary Saturday, we will be
giving up nearly 26 pounds per
man.”

*‘We are a group of men who
want to play,” summed up
Mosketti. *‘And we play hard.”

It is that type of machine that
succeeds.

Shipp is now leading the
Southern Conference in total
offense. On Saturday he passed
for 203 yards and two
touchdowns. Shipp was also
presented with a game ball by
Fagg.

Fagg also praised receiver
Walt Walker saying of his
performance that, ‘‘Pound for
pound, Walt is as good as there
is.”

Fagg felt that running back
John Webel played a good game
in place of the injured Dave
Ingold.

Davidson controlled the first
three quarters of the game,
leading 14-0 at the end of the
first half.

Bucknell was able to score in
the third quarter on a 43 yard
touchdown pass.

Fagg termed the slip up in
pass coverage on this play as,
“The only mental lapse we
made on defense."’

Going into the final quarter,
Davidson seemed to have the
game out of reach with an 18
point lead. Bucknell stormed
back however to score two
touchdowns in the final period.

After the second touchdown,
the Bison tried an on side kick
and almost recovered it. At this
point there was a little more
than a minute left in the game.
Fagg admitted that he was
beginning to feel nervous when
he saw the kickoff squirt from a
Davidson player's arms.

Fagg repeated once more
what a fine job the team did as a
whole.

“It was a real fine win for
us,” he said. ‘“‘They were a
veteran team with a lot of
experience and were prepared
defensively as well as anyone
we've played yet. I think that
the boys were just fired up and
that they really wanted to win
