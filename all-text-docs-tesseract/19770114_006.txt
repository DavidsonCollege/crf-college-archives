Committee studies

program changes

As a part of the five-year
plan to re-evaluate educational

policies, the Educational Poli-
cy Committee is investigating
the Extended Studies pro-
grams.

Extended Studies, since its
conception, has gone through
a series of changes which have
caused it to evolve into its
present state.

The program’s origin act-
ually goes back to 1965. In
that year, a Visiting Commit-
tee of the Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Schools,
after spending three days at
Davidson, submitted a written
report to the college concern-
ing our institutional self-stu-
dy. The report called our
chapter on the educational
program ‘“‘dull and unimagina-
tive.”

The Visiting Committee’s
report triggered the formation
of a faculty committee whose
job was to make recofmen-
dations to the faculty for the
details of a revised curriculum.
The Committee was dubbed
the Blue Sky Committee, and
was spear-headed by Dr. Jay
H. Ostwalt; the Registrar at
the time.

The Blue Sky Committee
submitted its report to the
faculty in November, 1967.
The Committee’s recommen-
ded curriculum was designed
to give students more flexibi-
lity and challenge.

The new curriculum went
into effect in 1968, and inclu-
ded graduation requirements
calling for the completion of 32
courses, with three courses
being the normal load in each
the fall and winter, and two
courses in the spring term. In
addition to the regular cour-
ses, each student was required
to take four area exams at
some point during his sopho-
more or junior year.

The spring terms, with only
two standard classes, were set
aside for the purpose of allow-

' ing students an opportunity to
prepare for these area exams,
usually by reading books from
wide-ranged reading lists

drawn up by the faculty.

The area exams quickly
became the source of a major
controversy, aS a majority of
the students had little or no
preparation for the exams.
The area exams were replaced
after two years by Extended
Studies.

Dr. Ostwalt commented on
the purpose, ‘‘As originaliy
conceived, the Extended Stu-
dies Program was designed to
give the students an opportu-
nity to follow some areas of
special interest which were not
available through the regular
courses in the Davidson curri-
culum.

In effect, it opened the way
for students to exercise a
substantial amount of freedom
in their decisions about what

_they should study at David-

son.” 5;

The Extended Studies Pro-
gram was mandatory in its
early years, requiring students
to take at least one Extended
Studies course each year:
Freshmen and sophomores
were supposed to take outside
their prospective majors; jun-
iors and seniors were required
to take an Extended Studies
course in their major. The
Extended Studies Program for

juniors and seniors remains ‘

virtually the same at the
present time.

Problems arose, however,
with the freshman-sophomore
program. The faculty mem-
bers became over-burdened
with the supervision of so
many students on individual
bases. The faculty had also
failed to establish the stand-
ards regarding the amount
and quality of work in Exten-
ded Studies, which werved to
weaken the program. Addi-
tionally, in many cases stu-
dents were being forced to
take something where there
may have been no interest.

The situation was alleviated
to some degree in 1973 when
Extended Studies for fresh-
men and sophomores became
optional. At the same time the
number of courses required for
graduation was raised to 36,
which is the situation today.

“The opportunity to create,
undertake, and complete a
project of one’s own design, a
project with legitimate and
substantial academic subs-
tance, is certainly a very
academically sound idea,’’
said Dean of Honors Center
Robert L. Avinger.

‘Whether and how you can
administer and control a pro-
gram that provides that op-
portunity—this is the crucial
question.”’

Most of the work done in the
Honors Center is similar to
Extended Studies in that the
student has a great deal of
input into his curriculum.

“But Extended Studies is a
different proposition from the
Honors Center,’’ said Avin-
ger.

“‘An Extended Studies is
only 1/9. of a person’s work-
load, while many courses in
the Honors Center are year-
long, , often interdisciplinary
programs.”’

“We are able to concentrate

Extended

Studies

on the Honors student and his
individual progress.”

Avinger indicated that this
organized administration is
probably not feasible for the
present program of Extended
Studies.

But some means of keeping
a tighter rein on students
working in Extended Studies
is necessary, ‘because misuse

of the program has occurred,”
said Avinger.

‘All Extended Studies must
possess academic substance—
I keep stressing that.’’

Avinger saw that highly
motivated freshmen and soph-
omores would -have difficulty
pursuing a special interest if
Extended Studies were elim-
inated.

““Maybe we could devise an
Independent: Project 95, pat-
terned after Independent Stu-
dies 295, and open it to
younger students who are
non-majors. Independent Pro-
ject 95 would emphasize tigh-
ter control, closer supervision;
and academic substance,’’ he

suggested.

“T see the need for an option
to allow a student to design a
program of study for himself
and to go in and carry it out,”’
said Professor of Psychology
John D. Kelton.

“The concept is sound—we
require our majors to pursue a
special interest in independent
studies, but (in psychology at
least) few freshmen and soph-
omores are ready to undertake
an Extended Studies.

“In psychology—and I
think this is true in some other
disciplines — few freshmen
come to Davidson with an
adequate background.

“If the younger student
expresses an interest in psy-
chology, we encourage him to
complete the first couple of
introductory courses.

“It is important to get a
grounding in an area before
any. Extended Studies are
undertaken.

tended Studies programs is

On the basis on random interviews,
The Davidsonian found many upper-
classmen are especially quick to
defend the Extended Studies as a
valid approach “‘to unique. .learning
experiences.’’ Most students with
whom we talked, both those that have
done such projects and those that
have not, are in favor of keeping such
a program. Students in most cases are
anxious to do some outside activity to

break the day to day academic .

monotony.

One freshman expressed it this
way, ‘‘I’d really be interested in
learning to shoe horses. All I know
about the Extended Studies Program
comes from what other students have
told me. I really don’t know where to
begin to look for a sponsor.”

A junior remarked, ‘‘Extended
Studies works best for the highly
motivated student willing to go
through the hassle of setting things
up.”

Another student put the situation
this way, ‘‘Usually the projects
seemed to demand more time than it
was worth to set up. That’s why I’m
going to try to take the photography
seminar —it’s already set up and it
will be a nice change.”’

Several upperclassmen expressed
their regret at not finding out until
too late just how many opportunities
Extended Studies offered. For most
juniors and seniors their Extended

Studies projects are limited to pro-
grams inside their major field. Eng-
lish majors, for example, are required
to take comprehensive exams. Math
majors for their junior year all study
the foundation principles and history
of mathematics. A senior math major,
then gets a choice to study something
of interest to him from the math field.

Along these same lines a Biology
major remarked, ‘‘The Extended Stu-
dies Program gave me a chance to
explore some of the practical aspects
of my major. I worked at a hospital,
kept a journal, and wrote a paper
about my experiences.”’

Several students also mentioned
that Extended Studies could help
relate your major to field of interest
related to the major, but which
Davidson does not offer as a regular
part of the curriculum.

One student expressed, “It might
be a good idea to go back to requiring
the freshmen and sophomores to do
Extended Studies ‘projects. It is
sometimes hard to get motivated on
this sort of thing, but I regret not
doing anything about, it when I had
the chance.” !

Some of the students with whom 'we
talked do feel that an Extended
Studies is a little easier than a regular
course. ‘‘This school is hard enough
and I don’t see any reason why you
can’t take it a little easier for one
term. There’s nothing wrong with
having some fun while you learn,’’
observed one senior.
