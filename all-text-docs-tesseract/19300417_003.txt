Side Line Shots

At the ’Cats on the Diamond
and Courts
By P. R. Alderman

The diamond men were unable to take
their Virginia opponents into camp as the
cagers did earlier in the year, losing two
hard-fought contests
week,

successively last

Williams, V. M. I. twirler, with the
aid of four Davidson errors, had little
trouble with the Wildcats, allowing
only six hits. “Hub” Covington got
more than his share in this game by
crashing out two singles in three times
up.

“Doc” Kugler was
against the Washington and Lee Gen-
erals to fan nine would-be-hitters and
hold the home nine to five hits. The Wild-
cats also gathered five bingles but failed
to make them count.

Captain in form

The 'Cats’ fielding in the second
game was far superior to that of the
day before, a double in which Miller,
Goodson and Gladstone featured be-
ing the bright spot of the afternoon.

But that trip is over and to be forgot-
ten. Today the Wake Forest Deacons are
met by the Wildcats for the second time
this vear, the former exercising the well
known jinx over Monk’s nine a few weeks
ago to pound out a decisive victory. Let's
help the ’Cats get revenge this afternoon!

Only two more Big Five games re-
main on Davidson's card for the rest
of the year after today and both of
these are against the Carolina nine.
Which means that the Wildcats have
a tough task ahead if they are to raise
their average in the state.

In. spite of the decisive Wake Forest
victory earlier in the season the indica-
tions are that the Tar Heels are going to
furnish the hardest opposition that the
‘Cats have met with in the state this year.
They have been going good all season
and have shown no signs of slowins up.

Jim Proctor, who has been kept off
the initial sack most of the season on
account of injuries, will probably be
ready for action in the Carolina
games next week. His hitting has
been missed and it will mean a lot to
have him back on the nine.

The Fresh nine, after getting off to a
whirlwind start, cut down on their speed
when they met the Charlotte High squad,
this game resulting in a 9-9 tie. It looked
like a sure Davidson victory at first but
a rally. by the visitors told a different
tale.

Another slugging test took pl
the following day when the Belmont
Abbey boys down the Kittens by the
count of 11-10. Three pitchers were
used by Coach Laird in an unsuccess-
ful effort to stop the home team.

The Kitten netmen took Charlotte into
camp to win the first battle of the year.
Judging from the showings made bv the
Freshmen it looks like they’re in for a
series of victories.

Captain Frontis John and and his
varsity racketeers have had plenty of
time to prepare for their contests
which will. start soon. Unless some
unforseen misfortune occurs most of
these should be Davidson wins.

Davidson to Play Three
‘Big Five’ Contests Soon

Wildcats Meet Demon Deacons and
Tar Heels in Decisive Games of
Schedule

PROCTOR MAY BE IN LINE-UP

Contests Will Conclude State
Schedules for Wildcats
This Season

With three games scheduled this week
with Big Five members, the Davidson Col-
lege baseball team enters this week on what
will probably be the decisive part of its
schedule in determining how they will finish
in the State race. The Wake Forest Demon
Deacons are ‘entertained here today, then
Carolina furnishes opposition for
and Tuesday afternoons.

Monday

The Wake Forest crew has already taken

the measure of the Wildcats once, when
they exercised the proverbial Demon Dea-
con jinx ‘on the recent State trip, and came
out in the lead at the end of the game. Monk
and his men are determined not to let that
happen again, and favored by playing on
their home ground, the odds seem to favor
Davidson, despite the decision they dropped
previously.
The Carolina team harder
proposition. They have not bee met by the
Wildcats this season, but their showing with
other opposition stamped them
powerful club. They are entertaining sev-
eral of the Virginia teams this week, and
it will be interesting to compare the out
come of their games with the Old Dominion
teams Davidson encountered on their recent
invasion.

presents a

has as a

The results of the Wildcats on their trip
north ‘last week were very disappointing,
to say the least. With one game rained out,
and dropping the other two contests, their
average for the trip was .000.-But according
to the law of averages, things are due to
change back the other way soon, and judg-
ing from the play yesterday, it seems like
that time is not far off.

The absence of Jim Proctor at first base
has weakened the entire infield, and has cut
down -on the hitting of the squad. If he is
able to play in top form today and next
week against the Tar Heels, the power of
the team whole will be greatly  in-
creased, He has been home recuperating from
a recent accident, and it is not. likely that
he will be able to hit the top of his stride
before the Carolina series.

as a

The rest of the squad played good ball
on the Virginia trip and bid fair to main-
tain their performances. The battle for the
shortstop position continues, with neither
Bernhardt nor McMillan having a decided
advantage. MecMillan’s hitting is nothing to
go wild about, and the fielding of neither
would cause the eyes of a big league scout
to drift that way. It seems to be the weak
spot of the club, but at that, not many balls
have gotten by the pair.

Following the Carolina game ‘Tuesday,
there remain only two more contests on the
1930 card, neither of which are Big Five
games. Therefore the outcome of the three
games this week will definitely settle the
final position of the Wildcats. With this in
mind, it is certain that the team as a whole
will put out everything they have to put
these three games on the right side of the

ledger.

Cigarette
Pleasure

WHY BE SATISFIED with less smoking pleasure when for the same
price you can have the luxury of Camels?

Camels stand alone. If you merely want to puff, anything will
do. But if you want to know the true delight of smoking—to en-
joy the mild, meilow fragrance of superbly blended Domestic and
Turkish tobaccos, brought to perfection by the most scientific
methods of manufacture but with none of the delicacy of its natural
goodness lost or spoiled by over-treatment—then Camel is the
cigarette for you.

You'll find in Camels all the exquisite enjoyment that can be
packed into a smoke.
