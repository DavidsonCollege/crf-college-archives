An elderly lady recently visited a Red

her for a moment and then asked of a
wounded Tommy:

Do you know of a soldier here with
one leg named Smith?

No, mum, I don’t happen to know
him, was the reply, but what was the

Lineup For Tennis -
Tournament Announced

McPheeters Defeats Manning in First
Heat.

The tennis tournament began on
Monday with a large number of en-
trants in the singles and seven teams in
doubles. ‘The entrants were as follows,
doubles:

Ormond and Ormond play Cunning-
ham and Cunningham. Kornegay and
Wilkinson mect McKeldin and Miller.
In the lower bracket, Hall and Spence
play Woods and Price. and the winners
of this match meet MecPheeters and
Lilly for a place in the finals.

‘Those who entered the singles were:

Upper half: Gaither and Rogers;
Spence and Cunningham, R. B.; Hall
and Cunningham, C. E.; Kornegay and
MecKeldin. Lower half: Manning and
MePheeters; Ormond, A. C., and
Woods; Lilly and Ormond, A. P.; Wil-
kinson and Price.

‘The great intergst which is being
shown in tennis this spring may — be
ascribed, in a large degree, to the fact
that a letter is being awarded to the
winner of the singles, for the first time.
Manager Cunningham is arranging for
a number of matches with other col-
leves, so it will be well worth the work
the winners of the tournament must put
into it. Tennis at Davidson has long
been in need of just such an impetus as
has been given it this vear in the form
of recognition by the athletic association.
From this time on it should take on
greater proportions as a college sport.

In Monday’s play McPheeters de-
feated Manning in three sets 6-3; 6-8;
8-6. Manning played a steady game,
but fell before the hard driving of his
opponent.

probable happens, the 191g baseball team

ing up well in the box, “Pig Tron” Sut-
ton is off first on account of a bad eye,
