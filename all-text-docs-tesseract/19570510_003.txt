Baseballers Drop
Lenoir Rhyne, 8-6

By JIM HAMILTON

Davidson's nine ended a not
too successful season on a hap-
pier note Tuesday afternoon as
they took a hard-earned victory
over Lenoir-Rhyne, 86. The
Cats scored three runs in the
eighth inning to break a 5-5
deadlock and then held the
|Bears to one run in the top
of the ninth to gain the victory.

Allen Moore started on the
mound for the Cats, but was
relieved by Dave Page in the
third inning. Page got the win.

Big men with the stick
for Davidson were Jim

West and Donnie McRee.

West slammed four hits in

five at-bats to finish the

season with a .459 batting
average, tops for the squad.

McRee, recent recipient of
the Tommy Peters Award,
gathered three safeties in five
trips to the plate. Two of Me-
Ree's hits were triples.

The Wildtats finished out the
season with a 6-15 record.. On-
ly conference wins were over
V.M.I. and Washington and Lee

Following West in bat-
ting averages were Shel-
bourne Wallace, George

Head For S. C. Meet

coach’s dream last Saturday as they completed their
second undefeated season in three years.

record by polishing off North|dual meet.

With a perfect season under
their belt, all eyes will be on
the Cats this weekend as they
participate in the Southern Con-
ference meet. Thirteen boys
left with coach Whittle Thurs-
day for Williamsburg, Virginia,
| where they will compete against
eight other schools.

The Wildcats will sorely
miss the services of regu-
lars Al Elder and Scott
Woodmansee. Pete Ash-
craft, ace distance runner
will see only limited action
due to a leg injury. Ash-
craft will run only in the
mile and will be under a
definite handicap.

Ed Phillips, of William and
| Mary. proved to be the locals’
number one nemesis, as he
knocked off Mike Martin, Dave
Pearsall, and John Robinson in
successive rounds.

TWO QUARTER-FINALISTS

Robinson and Semi Mintz ad-
vaneed to the quarterfinals be-
fore bowing out. Mintz fell to
Jim Tarr; eventual finalist, in
a 6-0, 8-6 match, while Robinson
dropped a 7-9, 9-7, 63 match to
Phillips

Davidson picked up twelve!
points in singles plays and five
points in doubles competition,
for 17 points, second only to
George Washington. Each ad-
vaneing entry scored one point
in the team tally

William and Mary is a heavy
favorite to cop the meet with
| Davidson, V.M.I., and V.P.L,
pected to battle for second.

Coach Whittle had this to say
,about the meet: “We are defi-
nitely not -in as good shape as
