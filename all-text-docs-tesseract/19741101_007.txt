Despite his fear, resignation and un-
certainty, the author is still willing to
seek a peaceful existence. Speaking to
the girl described as a dancer, he |
suggests that there may be a reason for |
her creation and development from a |
seed to a dancer, and if this is true, she |
has nothing to lose by creating on her |
own (Go ahead and throw some seeds of |
your own). .

His conclusion is that ‘somewhere !
between the time you arrive and the ;
time that you go/May lie a reason that
you are alive/but you’ll never know.”

In the final song on the album, i
Browne speaks again on this theme. He
urges us to be patient, to enjoy those
peaceful moments we do encounter,
and to let “creation reveal its secrets |

by and by.”

This sounds almost like a resolution.
One is reminded of the daydreamer on |
the second album who was willing to |
wait patiently to discover in himself the |
essence of “Everyman.” el

But then the one catch enters again. |
Browne goes apocalyptic, leaving us all |
rubbing our chins and wondering if |
anything makes any sense as he sings !
the last words on the album,

And when, the sand was gone and
the tide arrived

In the naked dawn only a few
survived

After the deluge.

No matter how pleasant this album is
in some of its individual parts, it is not ;
ultimately pleasurable except in so far |
as we can appreciate it for the distur- |
bing truths it reveals. : |

There is little to ease our minds and
nothing to escape with on this record. |
We are left with the impression that we;
are all a bit too late, for the sky. |

If Jackson Browne continues to|
develop as a writer and singer in the{
direction he is now clearly headed, hej
will undoubtedly write his next album!
in Mobile, and we will surely be hearing!
the Memphis Blues again. Until then,!
we can all attempt to deal with the ex4
ceptional “‘Late for the Sky.” |

While all these affairs are
proceeding at a hectic pace,
Truffaldino becomes the ser-
vant of Beatrice and Florindo.

Truffaldino, as the purveyor
of messages to both Beatrice
and Florindo constantly finds
himself in a jam when he is
requested to carry messages
to “his master.” The ensuing
mix-ups furnish a number of
amusingly awkward situations
as Truffaidino is constantly
beaten with his own slap-stick
for delivering the wrong
message to the wrong master.

Emilie Bryan’s appealing
portrayal of Clarice provides
a number of _ superbly
executed’ comic moments
during the course of the play.
Constantly upset by either
Beatrice or Silvio, her com-
plaints melt into torrents of
sobs and tears accented by a
distraught flourish of her
hanky.

Jane Reich offers a strong
and agressive Beatrice, who
in one horribly staged but
histerically funny sword fight
completely dominates poor
Silvio. Tony Martin, playing
opposite her in the intrigue,
presents a good version of a
fairly difficult role. As

probably the only character
in the play who is not a com-
plete’ fool, Florindo receives

good treatment from Martin
who represents him as prac-
tical and stable, an ideal con-
trast of the buffoonery in the
rest of “‘The Servant of Two
Masters.”

Smeraldina (Susan Colan),
the maidservant of Clarice
provides a transitional phase
between the exaggerated

mannishness of Beatrice and |

the farcical femininity of
Clarice. In this same way, the
clever but knavish Truf-
faldino bridges the neb-
bishness of Silvio and the
masculinity of Florindo. Thus
with the functioning of the
three pairs in the play,
Beatrice-Florindo, Smeraldin-
a-Truffaldino and Clarice-
Silvio, the. play demonstrates
not only the battle of the sexes,
but also the variouus levels on
which the battle is waged.

The action of the play ends
after approximately twenty-
four hours, with the three
pairs destined to be married,
an ending to please even the
strictest of Aristoteleans.

Once again, credit should
rightly be given to Mrs. Carol
Barber for her fine costum-
ing and for the fine set
design by a new-comer to the
Drama Department, Joseph
Gardner..

TURNING OVER ANEW LEAF _
Senior Betsy Norman, .while holding up a tree and holding
down a pile of leaves, decides to study to pass the time.

By JOE MCMILLAN
Associate Editor

A general rule is that nude
scenes should be photo-
graphed in the same way

| as any other scene. The part of
| the body below the belt should
| be photographed neither more

nor less than it would be were
it clothed.

Ken Russell, who un-
derstands many things about
cinema, would no more force
his camera to photograph a
nude scene prudishly than
force it not to photograph Ri-
chard Chamberlain’s hands
while he is pretending to play
the piano. .

(The music on the sound-
track of “The Mysic Lovers”
is someone else’s but the
finger movements we see are
Chamberlain’s.) All of the
films by Russell have the won-
derfully free, open-air quality
that is so important for
cinema.

Even when Russell’s movies
do not work--which, for a com-
plex of reasons, is fairly often-
-they are still recognizable as
cinema in a real and positive
sense. To photograph a nude
scene prudishly is like
photographing a room with a
chair in the middle of it and
for some reason alien to the
art form avoiding the chair.

This is not making a movie;
it is playing a game with the
audience. Prudish directors
suffocate their movies.

All of which: is intended as
an innuendo upon- the annual

situation and a direct con-
demnation of Mike Nichols’
“Carnal Knowledge.’’ The
film is about. varieties of
sexual ience.
Arthur Garfunkel and
especially Ann-Margret and

Jack Nicholson are often’

shown nude but never fron-
tally nude. As a consequence,
the film becomes slicker than
it is already and a rift in the
form is aggravated.

“Carnal Knowledge” is a
libertine, deadpan black
comedy by a comfortably mid-
dle-class director. Jules Feif-
fer’s consummate screenplay
is as single-mindedly vicious

as his cartoons in ‘‘The
Village Voice.’’
He observes well one aspect

of one aspect of life, the-un-
pleasant side of the sexual
side of life: The dialogue con-
sists mostly of one-liners and
monologues that show the
cleverness of the writer and
the vacuousness of the charac-
ters.

This screenplay presents a
problem for Nichols, because
cinema tends to. demand
either rounded characters or
stylization that incorporates
unrounded ones. Feiffer is not
interested in the former, and
Nichols, who lacks directorial
talent, is incapable of the lat-
ter

Perhaps Nichols is still sen-
sitive to the critical and
rejection of ‘Catch

22,”” for he does not even at-
tempt to find comic style in
“Carnal Knowledge.” What

reel to reel reviews

‘Carnal Knowledge’

effective style it has seems
due to accident rather than in-
tention.

The film is slick in mood
because slickness is what
results when all else fails. It is
an ugly experience because
Nichols is unable to present
ugliness in an aesthetically ac-
ceptable way. Unlike Ken
Russell’s, Nichol’s films do
not express a love of or a
vigour through cinema..

I suspect Nichols may not
even like cinema; he betrays

_ it often enough. He*is an ex-

pert reader of the public pulse,
and if a conflict occurs bet-
ween what the public wants—
say, Elizabeth Taylor in
“Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolfe?” or an R-rating for
“Carnal Knowledge’’--and
what his films need, then the
former wins out.

One of the most disgusting
things about his films is his
disgusting personality, which
is all the more disgusting for
being hardly present at all.
His films are colorless.

As so often happens among
film directors, a career of
widely differing films
Suggests that the director has
nothing to express. The only
exception I can think of is
Louis Malle.

Unlike the slender thread
that connects Malle’s films,
the thread in Nichols is ugly.
Nichols has the personality of
Neil Simon, whose plays he of-

‘ ten does on Broadway. ‘‘Car-

nal Knowledge”’ is written for

: the screen, but there are times.

when it seems a canned recor-
ding of a Simon play.

Nichols lacks an instinct for
cinema, so I feel free to in-
dulge my hatred of him. His
only successful movie, ‘“Who’s

Afraid of Virginia Woolfe?”’
‘succeeds because it is vulgar
and trashy.

Taylor does everything but
shout ‘‘Yahoo!”’ as she lunges
tastelessly through the film.
As a friend of mine who is bet-
ter versed in theater than Iam
has pointed out, ‘‘Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolfe?”’ is
intended by Albee to be a
serious work and not a car-
nival for actors. In ‘Catch-
22,” Nichols labors through a
dull, pointless, competent
Fellini imitation, and in ‘“‘Car-.
nal Knowledge” he does the
same for Bergman.

Fellini, Bergman, Russell ©
and Malle are artists and vir-
tually uncompromised ones.
When they make a film, they
do it well, or at least with
glimmers of talent. They seem
to care for what they do.
Nichols is the opposite on all
counts.

He is, however, a sensitive
director of actors. Ann-
Margret and Rita Morens do
some wonderful things in

film more |
ngly successful at best,
,and this is only when they are
_jon, which is not often.
