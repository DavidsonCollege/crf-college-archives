THE DAVIDSONIAN

Field hockey preps for Deep South

By Jay CANTRELL
Sparts Editor

Erin Smith got some help as she continued torise
up the all-time scoring ladder this weekend. But it was
not enough for the field hockey team, who lost a
frustrating 2-1 decision at Radford Sunday.

Smith was given credit for a goal scored at the
28:24 mark to give the Wildcats a 1-0 lead. The shot,
which could have been a pass, was deflected into the
goal by a Highlander.

“Td love to take credit for the goal,” said Smith,
“but I have to share it with the defender.”

It was the first time Radford had given up a goal
at home all season. ;

But the Highlanders came back in the second
stanza with two goals within five minutes of each
other.

Amanda Kitson converted a pass from Renee
LaMontagne at the 49:25 mark. LaMontagne scored
the game-winner on her own inthe 55th minute to give
Radford the 2-1 victory.

Smith’s goal gives her two more points in her
career. She is now tied for fourth on Davidson’ all-
time field hockey scoring list with 64 points on 28
goals and 8 assists. She shares the fourth spot with
Lisa Ballantyne. ‘

Davidson also had a game Friday against Will-
iam and Mary. The contest was held at Wake Forest.
The Wildcats lost 4-1 to the Tribe, but the score was

not indicative of the majority of the gamé.

“We played very well,” said Smith. “We hung
with them for a long time.”

The Tribe capitalized on a Davidson penalty late
in the second half to take a 1-0 lead.

After the break, Kate Schoening tied the contest
at one. Schoening and Jenny Gold switched positions
for the second half, and Schoening took full advantage
of the opportunity to play center forward.

But the Tribe’s offense proved to be too powerful
as they exploded for three late goals to take the 4-1
decision.

Friday’s result showed how much Davidson has
improved over the course of the season. William and
Mary was coming off a 1-0 loss to Wake Forest, and
the Demon Deacons defeated the Wildcats 11-0 ear-
lier in the year.

‘Now-the squad turns its attention to the Deep
South conference tournament, which will be held at
Davidson this weekend.

The Wildcats play their first game Saturday at
1:00 against Appalachian St.

The Mountaineers have won both contests be-
tween the teams this season, each by a score of 3-1.

Each team in the tournament will play two games,
regardless of Saturday’s results.

“Saturday is essentially the championship,” said
Smith.

“We need to beat Appalachian first, then focus
on the game Sunday.”

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1997

It is blatantly clear the men’s bas-
ketball team has tremendous potential
heading into this season — one that,
according to almost all national pun-
dits, should take them to the NCAA
tournament come March.

But, as coach Bob McKillop is
quick to point out, any amount of poten-
tial is useless until it is turned into
production.

Men’s
Basketball
Notebook

If the Wildcats’ first week of prac-
tice is any indication of things to come,
such a conversion is inevitable.

“Ithas been one of the most enjoy-
able and productive weeks of practice I
can recall in my 25 to 26 years of
coaching,” McKillop said Friday when
asked about his squad’s first five prac-
tices.

@ Billy Armstrong, a senior guard who will serve as co-captain for this year’s Wild-
a back injury. He was evaluated yesterday.

When asked to elaborate, he did so

WILDCAT BASKETBALL: PRESEASON COVERAGE

Potential being turned into production
First week of practice: ‘Competitive, passionate, responsive’

with only three words: “Competitive,
passionate, and responsive.

“They are a joy to coach.”

“But there is plenty of work to be
done,” he added. “And that’s an em-
phasis on plenty.”

And the squad has until Nov. 20 —
its Opener versus Duke at Cameron In-
door Stadium — to do it.

International influence

McKillop is known for his inter-

national connections, the products of

which can be seen every day on the
court — point guard Ali Ton from
Turkey, guard Davor Halbauer from
Croatia, and rookie swingman Emeka
Erege, a German-Nigerian who came
to Davidson via Long Island Lutheran
in New York.

Former international Wildcats in-
clude Cameroonian Narcisse Ewodo,
an All-Southern Conference forward
last season; Janko Narat, a 1994 gradu-
ate and standout on the 1994 NIT team;
and Detlef Musch, a Fulda, Germany,
native who was McKillop’s first recruit
at Davidson.

And right now at the Wildcats’
practices, there is additional tangible

oa sad ee ee

evidence of McKillop’s European con-
nections.

Four Greek coaches are ona month-
long trip to Davidson to observe the
squad’s practices.

The ninth-year coach did aclinicin
Greece in late June forthe Greek Coaches
Association. Last month, the president
of the Association called McKillop and
asked if four of his coaches could come
to Davidson to watch practice. They
will be here until mid-November.

Armstrong’s back acting up

Billy Armstrong, aco-captain ex-
pected to log minutes at both the point
and shooting guard positions this sea-
son, is nursing a muscle strain in his
back.

Armstrong first suffered the injury
on the squad’s trip to Italy in August,
“twist(ing) his body in a very unortho-
dox way,” according to McKillop. Ap-
parently, the ailment has not properly or
completely healed.

And the 6-foot-2 senior, who re-
cently wrenched it again, has not prac-
ticed yet but will likely return this week.

Armstrong was evaluated by team
trainer Scott Applegate yesterday.

tency is the thing. Both are very
consistent players, staying away from
the big numbers.”

At Huntersville, the Wildcats will
field two separate teams — a Davidson
Red and a Davidson Black — to give
more golfers an opportunity to play
competitively, according to Mark.
There will be a practice round Sun-
day.

The team hopes the strong foun-
dation built last spring and this fall’s
promising performance will pay off in
the league championships in April at
the Carolina Country Club in
Spartanburg, S.C.

“Thope we can finish in the upper
half of. the conference,” Mark said.
“It’s very competitive in golf.”

East Tennessee St. is nationally
ranked and Furman made the NCAA
tournament last spring.

Even so, McDaniel said, “‘Real-
istically, I think we can finish second
or third if we-play to our potential.”
“Everyone is playing close to as
well as they can,” Alexander said.
“Our mentality has changed from fin-
ishing in the middle of the pack to
being in contention.”

Jen O’Brien, a Middletown,
Conn., native and the Connecticut state
player of the year during a champion-
ship senior season at Mercy, made
practically immediate contributions
last year as a rookie for the women’s
basketball team.

The ball belongs to O’Brien

Sophomore takes on leadership role

Women’s
Basketball
Notebook

Playing at both the point and two-
guard positions, the 5-foot-5 offensive
threat averaged 8.2 points a game and
led the Wildcats with 99 assists. She
also led the squad in rebounding in two
contests.

She exploded for 18 points twice
against Southern Conference finalist
Georgia Southern, including an _18-
point, eight-board effort in the season-
ending league quarterfinal loss in
Statesboro.

With the graduation of Monica
Winter, last year’s starter at the point,
O’Brien has stepped into a greater
leadership position.

“O’Brien did a great job last year
of fitting into several different roles,”
coach John Filar said Friday after
practice. “This year, she’s just grabbed
hold of the point guard position, say-
ing, ‘This is my position for the next
three years. This is my team.’

“She’s done a fantastic job of
helping us playing up tempo.”

What does Filar want from
O’Brien — such a versatile player —
in terms of numbers?

“She’ll have a feel for the game,”
the coach said.

“She’llask herself, “Is this a game
where I need to have 12 assists or is
this a game where I need to score 20
points?’ She hasa great feeling for the
game of basketball.”

No repeat performance

basketball team is dead set on not

allowing another 1996-97, which ended

“tearfully in the conference quarters —
before the Wildcats’ ultimate goal of
Greensboro, the site of the semis and
finals last year.

“We couldn’t ask for a better
start,” Filar said. “Not just from abil-
ity, but their attention level and their
focus is so much better (than last year).
I’ve never seen them this determined.”

According to Filar, the upped in-
tensity is a direct result of disappoint-
ments over the last two years, in which
the Wildcats won 14 and 15 games —
both program-best outputs, but, espe-
cially last year, not nearly what the fF
team entered the season hoping for.

“We suffered some pain and dis-
appointments last year,” he added. “We
set some awfully high goals last year
and didn’t quite reach them. They
don’t want to go through that again.”

Health, as always, the key

Walking wounded — a cliche,
but an unfortunate and accurate de-
scription of the women’s basketball
team the last two years.

The Wildcats’ health — or lack
thereof — has arguably played the |*
biggest role in Davidson’s recent cam-
paigns of missed opportunities, un-
met expectations, and underachieve-
ment.

So far this year...

“Today was the first time we’ ve
had anybody with an ice bag,” Filar
said after Friday’s session, No. 6 onthe
year.

“This is as healthy as we’ ve ever
been at this point. That's the key to the
season — that we can put the people on
the court that we need to put on the
court.”

Which is something the Wildcats
certainly haven’t been able to do 4
recent years, most notably due to inju-
ries to budding young stars Jessica
Montrella, Jamie Brown, and Kerry
Brown — who needed the ice bag
Friday because of a slight twinge in her
ankle.

“Todo really well, any team wants
to get through a season with a little bit
of luck in terms of no injuries,” Filar
explained, “and we haven't had that
the past two years.”
