Unhealthy obsession
A Connells junkie shares his saga of abuse

By Ken May
Guest Writer

Finally! After three long years
of waiting, I finally got to see the
Connells in concert. Boy, let me
tell you, has it been a long frustrat-
ing road. Freshman year, my
hallmates introduced me to this
home-grown Raleigh band, but I
was helpless without wheels.
Sophomore year, I was somewhat
of an academic hermit, so I can’t
really say if the Connells evencame
to Charlotte.

In the fall of Junior year, the
Connells finally came to Charlotte
but alas, I was across the Atlantic
in Scotland. Come spring of Jun-
ior Year, I almost made it. I had

tickets to a show in Roanoke, Vir-

ginia, but the concert was canceled
the day before. So as you can see,
this past Thursday was a big day
for a junkie like me.

The concert was staged at The
Sound Factory, anew music venue
near UNC€. With a dark carved-
wood %eiling and concrete floor, it
was actually a pretty cool place to
chill to some hip tunes.

Along with my three fellow
Connell groupies, we braved the
styling, uptight UNCC crowd and

pressed toward the front of the
hall. The position we finally staked
out was about five feet from the
stage (good move) and one foot
from the massive speaker stack
(bad move).

A band called The Drag opened
for the Connells. When they first

The Connells.

came onstage, we didn’t realize
how appropriate their name was.
These Cure/Oasis look-alikes were
actually a “real drag” to listen to
and played about seven songs too
many. ButI guess that’s one of the
inherent functions of opening
bands. For an opening band to be
really good, it should stink so bad
as to make the audience yearn for
the headline band like never be-
fore. In that sense, The Drag were
awesome.

The Connells opened with a
string of songs from their new al-
bum Weird Food and Devastation
(which I’ve never heard,) which
seemed kind of generic Connells
at first listen. But after my room-
mate (bless his heart) raised some
serious hell yelling out song re-
quests, they switched over to their
older material, for which I give
him total props.

The remainder of the evening
proceeded magically. The
Connells sang bunches of songs
from Ring, Fun & Games and
Boylan Heights. Their live sound
was superb, showcasing the
Connells’ trademark soaring har-
monies and reverbed guitar. Of
course I was somewhat disap-
pointed for the lack of songs played
from “One Simple Word,” my fa-
vorite album. But my boys didn’t
let me down. They finished the
night with a rousing encore of
“Stone Cold Yesterday.”

So, mildly sedated and not so
mildly deaf in one ear, we headed
home for a long winter’s nap. The
next morning my ears were ring-
ing and my head was aching, but
man, I finally got to see the
Connells. Now I can graduate in

peace.
