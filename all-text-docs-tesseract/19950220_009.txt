THE DAVIDSONIAN Op IN IONS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1995

-Onthe street corner |

Graffiti is everywhere. I walk
up the streets of Roxbury, Massa-
chusetts well aware of the gang
youth staring me down trying hard
to discover who is the mysterious
female in their neighborhood. Am-
bulances fly by me. Walls adver-
tise the “Crips,” the “LA Posse,”
and other gangs in spray paint. I
cringe when I see names scratched
out, signifying a person will be
“knocked off.”

Heads turn as I amble down
the street. There are two answers
to my presence. The first is a crack
customer, and the second is an
undercover cop. My appearance
deceives the first notion; my age
the second. :

I learned while exploring
Roxbury that the easy answers to
violence are the most erroneous
ones. The young men I met taught
me more than I could have discov-
ered on overzealous news broad-
casts and misinformed news re-
ports. The blame should not be
placed solely on broken homes,
immoral values, or poverty. The
cause for the madness that plagues
our cities has much more to do
with self-hatred and the lack of
exposure these youth receive.
When you believe there is no hope
— nothing outside of the nearest
street corner — you allow your
heart to harden in an attempt to
fend off disappointment or dis-
may. And when your heart hard-
ens, you lose the claim you once
had to your soul. And when you
lose your soul, there is no fear of
losing it all.

Ernest is 19, tall and ebony.
His hair stands as if it is alarmed,
illustrating why he is called Chaos.
He shows me his art work proudly,
and we talk about the future he

wants as arap star. I cringe, hating
the fact that the only time he has
ever seen a black man applauded is
as an entertainer or an athlete. Be-
yond him, a funeral announcement
lists his brother dead at 16; mur-
dered due to association. The other
young men whisper to me about
the funeral, the surreal moaning
that escaped from.Chaos’ lips, the
threats he screamed for revenge to
anyone who might hear, the si-
lence draped with sobs. His time
now is filled with community ser-
vice, delicately piecing together
his life and rebuilding the commu-
nity he helped destroy.

My most startling moment
comes with Jordan. He is 20, hand-
some and blonde. One of the young

men [had talked to earlier calls out .

to me: “He needs aride.” Inod and
point towards my car. Weclimbin
and begin to ride across the city.
The story that unfolds is amazing.

He is a prep school kid with a
trust fund whose family lostmoney
in the recession. He talks about
Hemingway and French Imperial-
ism as we run errands and eat at a
nearby Chinese restaurant. He has
just sent applications off to
Harvard, Columbia, Williams,
Colby, Vassar, and the like.

His family moved during the
recession. The place, however,
lent itself to crime. He is on proba-
tion for a series of crimes: armed
robberies, assault with a deadly
weapon, and assault with intent.
He talks of getting “back to the
essence.”

After all he has seen, experi-
ence has almost brought him back
to innocence. He talks about leav-
ing Boston, going to college and
starting afresh, outrunning his his-
tory. “Yet it always seems I create

something else for me to deal with
in a new environment,” he almost
whispers. This time, I sense, will
be different for him.

He makes me laugh, and, at
times, he makes me avoid the sub-
jectsoI will notcry. Iask about his
family only to find out his father is
dead, and he hasn’t spoken to his
mother in months. His rampage of
crime ended his prep school, upper
middle class living. He talks of
“the hood” as if he has known it all
his life. He is alone, andI suddenly
feel as if Iam his parent. He looks
at me and says he thought I was

older. I think to myself that I feel

so much younger. For a while, we
ride on in silence.

Nobody wishes to be a failure.
When forces are against you, how-
ever, and it seems as if you cannot
win under any circumstances, the
graceful, only dignified way to lose
may be on the street corner. So you

choose that route so that for just
one time in your life, you know
whatitis to have choice, and choice
becomes power. And power, un-
fortunately, is what our society has
taught us to value most.

The trauma in American cit-
ies has very little to do with where
you are from in the neighborhood.
It has much more to do with who
you are allowed, or are expected,

to evolve into as a person. When a .

child does not know love or hope,
a dangerous thing .can happen.
Dreams are underestimated.

The answer is not just in social
programs, policemen, and jobs. It
runs far deeper. The answer is a
revitalization of self-worth and
hope in these youth. Anger has a
source; as a society we can not
forget that truth. Change will come
when we individually question our
beliefs and respond to paradigms
we hold true.

There are triumphs in the
streets. Chaos and Jordan are walk-
ing the delicate ladder to reform.
They must unlearn years of what
they have been taught. It takes
time to heal and begin anew. [am
confident, however, that they can
do it.

Almost all of us have the in-
tention of some day making a dif-
ference in ourcommunities. Good
intentions, however, can do noth-,
ing unless they are forced into ac-
tion.

They will not save a life today
or teach a young man to read or get
a gun off the streets. There comes
a time when we can no longer just
speak.

We must act. Someone must
help these youth regain themselves.
If they continue to believe they
have nothing to lose, we as a soci-
ety may just lose it all.

Project LEEO, Leadership
Education and Employment Op-
portunities, is anonprofit organi-
zation that targets at-risk and
gang-affiliated youth from inner-
city environments and puts them
through a rigorous training and
survival program on Thompson’s
Island in Boston Harbor.

We all stood awkwardly in
front of South Station, baseball
caps turned to the back of ourheads
and pants sagging around our legs.
We eyed each other suspiciously.
Emestcracked his knuckles, Ebony
stared straight ahead, and the rest
of us appeared to be concerned
with something or other of great
(in)significance. All of us won-
dered what we were about to do.

On the streets our status had
been built upon a reputation that
we carefully cultivated for years; it
was all about who had the money
and power. Respect was measured
in material items and the distinct
lack of giving a shit about any-
thing. Most of the values that
mainstream society embraces, we
scored. As we boarded the boat
to Thompson’s Island, the Chi-
cago group sat together, the Bos-
ton group sat together, and I stood
alone somewhere in between —
the white kid from Philadelphia.

I had just been released from

Ill Caucasian

Jordan Hall, an actual participant in the program obseved by our own .
Rosie Molinary, shares his thoughts and feelings from the experience.

prison and figured that living on an
island for two months during the
summer couldn’t be that tough to
handle: besides, I joined LEEO
mostly because it was a way into

City Year. I soon found out that

participation in LEEO was a lot
harder than doing time in jail. It
was hard for everyone. When we
first arrived, we all naturally con-
centrated all of our efforts on prov-
ing who we were before coming to
LEEO rather than who we wanted
to be after we left. Most conversa-
tions consisted primarily of war
stories and most actions were de-
signed toreflect how “ill” we could
be. The first few weeks were full
of fights, arguments, and shit-talk-
ing. Everyone had something to
prove; a jailhouse mentality ruled
the day. On our first camping trip
into the wilderness, tensions

reached a boiling point. Rather

than come together, we instinc-
tively resorted to our fists. Iended
up having to be evacuated to a
hospital. I received eight stitches
above my eye, and it was all be-
cause I felt I was being disre-
spected. I definitely could not let
that happen!

I was in a unique and often
uncomfortable position of being
the only white corps member. —
one who suffered from acute rosy-
cheek syndrome. Despite all of my
efforts, it seemed thatI would never
be considered “one of the guys.”
Many times I would walk into a
conversation, only to be told to
leave because I wouldn’t under-
stand; it was “a black thing.”

I wanted to be accepted and to
disprove all of the stereotypes, real
or imagined, that I felt were going
to hold me back. Part of me knew
what LEEO was about and wanted
all that it had to offer; the other part
was only concerned with fitting in.
I first had to learn to accept myself
before I would be accepted by any-
one else.

In those first days, we were
stripped of all the comforts of our
previous environments and were
presented with tools which would,
ideally, allow us to re-integrate
ourselves into society as positive,
contributing, community-oriented
young men. No longer were we to
have the luxury of being able to
walk away or fight rather than re-
ally face up toaproblem. We lived

in close quarters with our peers,
and if there was an unresolved
issue it didn’t just magically disap-
pear. Instead, we were forced to
deal with it rationally. At LEEO
we came together on a level play-
ing field; and there was no cover-
ing up who we were, once we were
there. I don’t know exactly when
people started being real. I don’t
know what day it was when Ernest
stopped taking twice as much food
as he needed and started thinking
about all of our stomachs, and I
don’t know when we started per-
ceiving staff as our friends rather
than our enemies. I only know that
is where we are today. By no
means are we perfectly happy
campers, but we are-getting closer
with each passing day. We have,
for the most part, conquered all of
the bullshit that separated us in the
beginning. Hameed, the cause of
my stitches, is now someone I con-
sider a great friend, whom I seek
out rather than hide from.

Who we were really doesn’t
havea whole lot to do with who we
are today. A lot of the stress on
absolute individualismis gone. Not
that we are a bunch of Stepford

corps members, but we can now
identify ourselves as part of the
whole that makes up LEEO. Our
own definitions of ourselves are
completely different than they were
on July 10, 1994, when we entered
the program, I once wanted to be
knownas the “Til Caucasian.” Now
I will be content with the less flashy
title, “City Year corps member.”
It’s hard for me to believe how
much can change in two months,
especially when I am in the midst
of it, but I am extremely proud of
myself and of all my brothers. I
will always remember our last trip
together, a deep-sea fishing expe-
dition: Tyrone let us hit lobster
traps as he spaced-out on the bow-
watch; Jesse and Guillermo fell
asleep during their anchor-watch
duty; Ebony swore he could navi-
gate us through virtually uncharted
waters; Ernest in his big yellow
fisherman’s hatdanced around with
the radio at night as we pulled into
the harbor. We were content to be
a dysfunctional family of sorts.
For better or for worse, I love these
guys!
