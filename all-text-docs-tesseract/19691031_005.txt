The Dream Continues

At first it was an impossible dream. Gradually,
however, week by week, it developed and advanced
from the stage of impossibility to stages of improba-
bility, uncertainty, possibility, probability, and al-
most to certainty,, dnly to have a five-minute disaster
wipe out weeks of progress. »

And so that football dream of a berth in the
Tangerine Bowl and national respectability and recog
nition has onée again returned to the stages of im-
possibility.

Yet did these delusions of grandeur, these hopes
of a first-ever conference gridiron title and bowt-bid
actually end in. Charleston last Saturday?

Not really, especially if one analyses the, present
ituation.

The Citadel will be playing Richmond
Spiders’ homecoming game:-anc Richmond

lost a conference game at home in a long, long time.
Don’t count on The Citadel being the Southern Con-
ference representative this year, in any bowl.

Therefore, the Wildcats’ two remaining confer-
ence games, tomorrow against VMI and next Satur-
day at East Carolina, take on that much more meaning.

For the first time, Davidson will be in the Avis
roll of trying to catch the leader. If the Wildcats can
actually catch The’ Citadel, then, just like the Mets,
they deserve every honor that comes their way.

The first step toward the impossible dream will
be tomorrow's game with the Keydets from VMI.
VMI hasn’t won this year, but then the.Keydets hadn't
won last year when they came to Davidson, either,
and still managed to take their only victory of the
year at the Wildcats’ expense.

There isn’t much difference in the VMI teams of
last year and this year, but there of course is‘a dif-
ference, in the Davidson teams, and therefore the
Wildcats have got to be rated:as heavy favorites.

The leading Keydet rusher this season is Tom
Sowers, who last season ran the ball 52 times for 217
yards and two touchdowns in one game-against Da-
vidson. This year, however, fortune hasn’t smiled as
much on Sowers and he has managed only 156 yards
in 46 carries, for no scores.

Actually, fate hasn’t been too kind to. any of the
VMI boys this year, VMI has managed only 66 first
downs in six games, and 10 of-those have’ come from
penalties. In comparison, their opposition has rolled
up almost 150 first downs. ; e

The Keydets have managed only three touch-
downs, going the first three games of the season with-
out scoring. They opened with a 55-0 drubbing by
Rice, then lost 20-0 and 32-0 to Richmond and West
Virginia.

And then there was joy in Lexington. VMI scored-
twice-in their next game, losing to Virginia only by
28-10. Following were 28-2 and 25-17 losses to The
Citadel and William & Mary.

One of the main weaknesses for the Keydets

this year has been. at quarterback, where Murphy
Sprinkle has led the team with 46 completions out
of 156 attempts for 534 yards, or less than 90 yards
a game.

The Wildcats’ present statistics are much more
impressive. Gordon Slade is second in the nation in
passing, having completed 126 of 188 passes for 1412
yards and 12 TD’s. Mike Kelley ranks third, George
Hannen ninth, and» Mike Mikolayunas 15th in the
nation in receiving, while Ed Terry ts 18th in scor-
ing by kicking. ~ i

By all indications, then, Davidson will win to-
morrow’s contest handily. But then there is last year
to take into consideration.

Here’s hoping . . . yi

Phi Delts Nearing Title
As Sig Eps, Pikas Lose

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

The Phi Delts wrapped up
the IMAC _flickerball title
this week for all practical
purposes as they won three
games in a row to run their
record to 9-0. The teams
which are closest to the Delts
in the standings are the KA's,
Pikas, and Sig Eps, all of
whom have lost two games.

The Delts beat the pre-
viously unbeaten Sig Eps last
Friday, 38-25, slid by the
Kappa Sigs on Monday, 31-
6, and routed the Indepen-
dents, 56-12, on Wednesday.

trol of the game. They al-
ways had at least a one
touchdown lead after their
first score of the second half.

Tailback Bill Traxler play-
ed his usual steady game,
as he directed several Delt
touchdown drives. Jeff Chet-
wood, Jack Steele, and Cliff
Duke were the outstanding
receivers for the Delts.

The SPE offense also play-
ed a strong game, but the
differences in defenses de-
termined the outcome.

A God: Forshee Place

The Citadel is a God-forsaken place. If you ever
approach the campus at night (try to avoid it at all
times if possible), a guard sticks an M-1 or something
in your face and asks what you are doing there.

” The football stadium and parking area are located
in what was a swamp that was. previously used for
hand grenade and motar practice, Lhe school itself
looks much like the fortress that the: name calls to
mind

After completing this ritual they are allowed to
4 proceed to the stands to watch the game. This isn't
accomplished. in, what maght be called an orthodox

manner either, They are dismissed two
at a time

Upon dismissal the soldier boys run across the
field and up into the stands. Yet they aren't satisfied
just to run. Every so often a cadet will throw himself
on to the field, roll over and over, and see how many
of his buddies he can trip. Being neither agile enough
nor able to think quiékly enough (if at all), quite a
few boys go down in a heap. This gives the crowd a
big laugh. baie

After those who have survived the dash have fin-
ally gotten into their seats, they must decide what the
dress for the game will be. Saturday they voted in
favor of taking off their coats. It was amusing,.to say
the least, to look out and see all of them in their gray
wool pants, held up by contrasting white suspenders.
Their completely exposed baby blue undershirts
‘really made the outfit complete.

While most of the corps do their thing, the band
also takes part in a special function. They align them-
selves along part of the field and harass the visiting
team as it warms up. I guess wearing a uniform makes
anyone feel tough.

After all of these activities are completed the
football game can begin. Throughout the .game the
corps continues to show its more than-mild enthu-
siasm by yelling so loudly that the opposing team
can't hear well enough to check off at the line. In
addition they continue their personal intimidation by
pouring their vociferous wrath on any opposing play-
er or coach whenever the opportunity arises.

In spite of all the school’s natural disadvantages,
The Citadel’s current football team is a good one.
Both their running and passing games were impres
sive Saturday, and we didn’t move consistently against
their defense. ; ne

Yet we played pretty well ourselves — probably
well enough to have won under normal circumstances.

companies

But the circumstances weren’t normal at all, and we,

lost. Anyone who talks of the likes of the. crowd’s
hostility being a big factor in a loss stands open to
sour grapes criticism. Se, open I stand.

I cannot convince myself that we wouldn’t have
beaten them if the game had been played before a

_ocivilized-audience.

| will admit, though, that The Citadel was psyched-
up for the game — it was homecoming and they were
playing hated Davidson. They even had something
else going for them — they could stay out past mid-
night if they won.

This week it’s our turn. We are going to: play a
homecoming game at home for a change. That in
itself will get the team up.

Even in the loss last week the players ‘proved
themselves by coming back twice when two touch-
downs behind in spite of both The Citadel ‘football
team and the crowd (who were quite correctly refer-
red to as*the twelfth man on the field by the p.a. an-
nouncer).
