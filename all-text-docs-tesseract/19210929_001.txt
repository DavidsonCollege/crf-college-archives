Successful Chautauqua
Program Brought to Close

Twenty Citizens Guarantors for Next
Year’s Tent Performances

Two performances each day on Tues-
day and Wednesday of last week
brought Davidson’s Chautauqua program
to a close. The opportunity afforded
by the entertainments to townspeople
and. students was enjoyed and appreci-
ated a great deal.

Tuesday Afternoon.

On Tuesday afternoon, September 20,
the Radcliffe Chautauqua presented its
third performance. The spacious tent
was very nearly filled and everyone was
more than repaid for his time, trouble
and money.

Mr. Moomaw led off with a very snap-
py number on the accordian. His num-
ber was very judiciously selected, con-
sisting of operatic, sentimental and jazz
selections. Among his best ‘were “I
Never Knew,” “Danny Boy” and “I’m
Nobody’s Baby.”

He was followed by Mr. Plumstead,
who impersonated everything from a
baby to a woman. His numbers were
varied, some. sentimental and some
ludicrous, of which the latter were very
much in the majority. Among the sen-
timental, his best was a tale of .the
North Woods, in which the prayers of
a pious mother figured largely. “The
Morning Mail” was by far his best hu-
morous selection.

The pianologues of Miss Shepherd
were enjoyed by everyone. The pro-
gram ended with a few short stories,

which were enjoyed very much by the
little folks.

Tuesday Night,

- The Radcliffe Chautauqua performance
on Tuesday night was one in which an
unlooked for actor took part. This ac-
tor was an electric storm, which gave
the program a decidedly unique touch.
In the midst of the first number the
lights went off, and illumination was
provided only by lanterns until some
car owner conceived the idea of running
the hood of his machine in the front en-
trance of the tent and throwing his
searchlight on the stage.

The first feature of the evening was a
lecture by Dr. Gilver on “The American
Social Ideal,” or “How to Live Happily
Together.” He showed that the social
problem of this country is an ever-pres-
ent one and far more basic than either
the political or the industrial problem.

SEVEN NEW MEN TAKEN INTO
OMRICON DELTA KAPPA RANK

At a recent meeting of the Davidson
chapter the following new members
were taken into the Omricon Delta Kap-
pa: Dr. Frank Brown, of Trinity, Dr.
Grey, Dr. J. M. Douglas, J. C. Bailey, J.
S. Curry, R. R. Deaver, D. R. LaFar, and
J. P. Price. The old members are: Dr.
Martin, Dr. Sentelle, Dr. J. M. McCon-
nel® Mr. F. L. Jackson, Dwight Chal-
mers, Coach Grey, Coach Hengeveld, J.
M. Richards, J. M. McFadden and T. M.
Lowry.

Omricon Delta Kappa was founded at
Washington and Lee University in 1914.
The purpose of the organization is to fill
the need of some honorary organization
to give suitable recognition to men who
have gained distinction in college life
and to bring them into a closer friend-
ship. It strives to promote a better col-

lege spirit and a greater zeal for the up-|

building of the student life. At the end
of each year the organization presents a
medal to the member of the Senior class
who has done the most for the college
during his four college years.

Dr. Frank Graham Ap-
peals for Thorough
Scholarship
Professor of History at State Univer-

sity Makes Great Address at
Y Service

The “Y” enjoyed one’ of the most en-

thusiastic and instructive meetings of
the year Sunday evening, when Dr.
Frank Graham, of the University of
North Carolina, spoke on “The Place of
Scholarship in College Life.”
. Dr. Graham is an alumnus of Caro-
lina. He served. in the Marine Corps
during the war and is now associate
professor of history at the University.
While he is a young man in years, Dr.
Graham has had unusual opportunities
of observation and spoke as a man of
authority.

He spoke of a college man’s duty to

lege activities. Quoting ex-President
Wilson, he said that college men all
over America are allowing the side
shows of college activities to crowd out
the main circus of books and classes. He
said college men are allowing inciden-
tals to take the place of fundamentals.
As examples of students who have suc-
ceeded because of application, our last
three Presidents were pointed out. Some
younger men, alumni of well known col-
leges of the South, were also cited. As
the central theme of his address, Dr.
Graham pointed out that our college life
is shaped: primarily to teach us appli-
cation and concentration, andethat these
things can be learned nowhere so well
as at our books.

The entire audience felt the power of
this reasoning and cach one resolved to
apply himself more diligently hereafter.
Let us all keep these good resolutions.
The price of leadership is hard work
and we are all preparing to be leaders.

Glee Club Itinerary and
Program Has Been Fixed

Four Points to be Visited, Several
Freshmen on Club

Under the able leadership of D. P.
McGeachy the Glee Club will present on
its trips this year one of the best pro-
grams that it has ever arranged. Be-
sides the usual “College Days” and popu-
lar songs it will offer a burlesque on the
sextette from Lucia, and the mandolin
club will aid with several numbers. The
management also plans to work up a
vaudeville act.

Only one concert has been definitely
| arranged but the other engagements are
| pending and are practically settled. The
jclub starts on its trip on November 7,
| giving its first concert at Flora Macdon-
jald. Oxford High School, N. C. C. W.,
|and Salem College are the other stop-
ping places. This is the only trip of any
length that the club can make this year
jas it is allowed but seven days during the
entire year, and this trip will consume
six of them. The management is plan-
ning, however, to give concerts this
| spring to nearby places at which it will
| be profitable to make the trip and which
jcan be reached without missing any
| classes.

| The new men have not been definitely
| picked but it is certain that there will be
six of the Freshman class who will make
these trips and fill the places left va-
pant by the men that graduated last year.
The places-in-the quartet, left vacant by
Law and Vance are being filled this year
by Jones and Raker.

Year of Worthwhile Work
Begins in Military Unit

Officers and Non-Commissioned Of-
ficers Named by Major Hearn

Major Hearn has quickly organized the
k. O. T. C. this fall and. things have
started off with a rush. Clothing was
issued two weeks ago and the battalion
certainly looks good in regulation uni-
form. The work of the last two weeks
has been instruction in the simpler mili-
tary drills, chiefly for the Freshman
Rifles will be issued this week
and more complicated movements will
be taken up. The R. O. T. C. has bright
prospects this year and it is expected
to do the students much good.

class.

A new system has been adopted in re-
gard to the cadet officers this year.
Promotion to and holding of commis-
sioned and non-commissioned offices
will be for merit only. In the past, it
has been the custom for Seniors to be
captains, Juniars to be lieutenants, and
so forth. So this year, a cadet officer
may be assured that he has won his com-
mission only by merit, and this system
gives everyone a chance to go to the
top. ‘

On September 20th Major Hearn an-
nounced the following personnel for
the battalion: Y

Bound Copies of Davidson
College Magazine
: Received

Interesting Addition Made to Reading
Matter in the Library

The Davidson College Magazines for
the last college year have been received
at the Library from the binders, and,
after having been catalogued and con-
veniently arranged on the shelves in
the magazine room, are now ready for
the students.

These magazines contain many inter-
esting topics, topics that should be of
especial interest to Davidson students,
particularly the new men who would
like to know more of Davidson’s past
literary activities.

This is only one of the recent addi-
tions to the already numerous attrac-
tions of the Library, and all students
will find it well worth their while to

spend some time in the magazine room.

interesting bits of knowledge and facts
that have not been recorded in the an-

Wireless Station Bought
and Installed by Students

Ben Team of Navy Experience to Ope-
rate the Station

A dream long cherished by Davidson
has at last become a reality has
finally secured a wireless station. Work
began on the establishment of this wire-
less last Saturday, but due to
trouble in the “hook-up,” it was not con-
nected up in time to secure the reports
from the Davidson-Virginia game.

The receiving set is of the Paragon
System, the latest model placed upon the
market, and is capable of receiving from
high power stations from all over the
world, It is also capable of receiving
wireless telephone messages.

The transmitter is 1-2 kilowatt run on

110 volt alternating current. The
rotary gap is used. This transmitter is
to be replaced later by an apparatus of
a much higher power,

The site for the antennae has not been
definitely decided upon, but it is very
probable that it will be-strung from the
flagpole to Shearer Hall. In this’ case
the station will be located in the base-
ment of Shearer Hall.

The wireless will be operated by B. L.
Team, of the Sophomore class. He has
had two years’ experience in an ama-
teur station of his own, and 27 months
as an operator in the U. S. Navy.

By means of this wireless it will be
possible to obtain play by play reports
from practically all of the remaining
football games on Davidson’s. schedule

Virginia Defeats Wildcats
in Opening Football Game

Red and Black Warriors Make Good
Showing Despite Score

By squeezing over a touchdown in the
last 15 seconds of play, the University of
| Virginia succeeded in making the count
28 to o and taking the opening contest
,of the 1921 football from. the
Davidson Presbyterians. The Virginians
scored in each of the first two
periods and twice in the last. Two of
their touchdowns made via the
aerial route, one was the result of a
blocked punt, while another was made
jby running plays. Davidson's best
chance to score came in the third quar-
ter, when she succeeded in carrying the
ball to her opponent's 30-yard line.” But
the necessary punch was lacking and the
ball was lost on downs.

It is agreed by all who saw the game
that the 28-0 score is no true indication
of the orelative strength of the two
teams. Virginia undoubtedy had the
team; her twelve pounds to
jthe man advantage in weight and un-
limited reserves counting heavily in her
favor, At ‘the same time the fight and
spirit of the Wildcats was a factor to
he reckoned with throughout the game.

The driving acrial attack of the Vir-
ginians was the outstanding feature of
their play.

Two touchdowns were the
direct result of this style of attack, and
it paved the way for another. The Old
Dominion opened with her repertoire of
forward passes early in the game and a
touchdown six minutes after the kiek-
off was the result. In the second period
they doubled their score when Shackle-
ford blocked one of Long's punts. In
the third quarter the Carolinians nfide
their most try for victory.
Karly in the final period the Virginians
seored their third touchdown on a series
of line plays and endoruns. In the elos-
ing moments of the game they got their
last tally on a sensational forward pass
to Davis.

Although defeated rather badly, there
were many redeeming features of the
Wildcats’ play. Vhey had nine — first
downs to their credit and Virginia went
