Five Court houses in debt to Colle

Contoller’s Office will set up installment plan to allow houses to work

By JoaNNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

‘ Because of confusion over
billing, five Patterson Court houses
have not fully paid their bills to the
College and are thus in debt.

The most one house owes is ~

over $4,000. Most of the houses
attribute their debts to the
Controller’s Office not making
clear how and when they had to
pay.

Each house is billed monthly

for expenses including natural gas,
Physical Plant charges, health in-
surance, and worker’s compensa-
tion for employees.

According to Steve Shames,
President of Patterson Court Coun-
cil, each house on the Court has
received monthly statements for
these expenses for at least the past
two years. Yet many of the Houses
complain that the Controller’s of-
fice never explains when the money
is due and never sends actual bills.

As a result, Shames reports

that Patterson Court has a debt of
over $20,000, with each house
owing varying amounts.

Annette Bagley, who works
in the Accounts Receivable De-
partment of the Controller’s Of-
fice, suggests that the build-up of
debts is due to the yearly changes
in house treasurers and presidents.

She .says that successors to
these positions are not made aware
of the house’s debts owed to the
Controller’s Office.

One former treasurer says he

was made aware of the situation,
but was also told that the
Controller’s Office did not make
much of an effort to obtain the
money, nor did they charge any
interest.

Like many other Patterson
Court treasurers, he just “let the
situation ride.”

Now houses are having to face
their debts because the: school is
taking more aggressive measures
to collect the money.

But most houses cannot fore-

off debts of up to to Be

see paying off their debts this year
because they have already set their
budgets.

Bagley attended a PCC meet-
ing where she explained that some
houses need to work on paying off
their debts.

She says five houses are in
“excellent shape,” but the other
five need to work on setting up
payment plans.

Shames says that the houses

College moving towards networked dorms

By Brap D. CHAsE
Staff Writer

After the visit of a communi-
cations firm last week, Davidson

has movéd another leap and bound

campus.

Trellis Communications, Inc.
visited Davidson for three days
last week. While here they talked
with the computer services staff,
system managers, students, and
faculty in order to determine the
College’s wants and needs forelec-
tronic communications.

The firm is currently busy
going over layouts of all college
buildings to determine what mate-
rials will be needed to network all
dormitories and academic build-
ings.

Some of the buildings are al-
ready wired for ethernet, a high
speed data connection that would

. allow students access to such fea-

tures as Netscape. However, these
dorms, Duke and two of the Senior
Apartments, do not have the nec-
essary wiring hooking them to the

network itself. Trellis hopes to
have a plan drawn out by the first
of the year and then go over any
problems or questions the College
may have.

After working out concerns,

senting a plan to the trustees by

March. Since the improvements
suggested by Trellis will not fit
into any regular budget areas, the
trustees will have to vote to fund-
ing any wiring that will be done.

If approved, the College will
phase in the updates over the next
few years.

’ Atmeetings with students and
faculty, the long wait when at-
tempting to establish a modem
connection to the network at all
times of the day was cited as a
major problem. Trellis suggested
adding more modems until the net-
working plan takes effect.

Among other suggestions that
Trellis will take into consideration
when formulating the master plan
for networking at Davidson are
