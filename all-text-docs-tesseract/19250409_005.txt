which is: See you Thursday, kiddo.

Roland Parker to Head
Twenty-six Next Year

D. G. Wilson and R. W. Graves Are
Elected to F ene Offices in
ss

At the election of the officers for the ris-
ing Senior class, which was held last Thurs-
day morning, R. B. Parker was elected
president. Other nominees were D. G. Wil-
son, E. K, Regen and T. S. Baker. A second

ballot taken between Parker and Baker was |

necessary,

On account of lack of time the election of
vice-president and secretary had to be post-
poned until Friday morning. Nominees for
vice-president were D, G. Wilson, F. R.
Hudson, J. W. Anderson, and A, Y, Bowie,

Jr., and Wilson was elected. Those nomi-

nated for secretary were C. E. Houston, R.!

W. Graves and J. M. Garrison. Graves was
victorious..,,

Roland Brice Parker, of Farmville, N. C.,
has shown himself to be’ a. tireless worker
since he came to Davidson as a Freshman.
Not only is he a scholar, and an intercol-
legiate debater, but he made a reputation as
a salesman of Lyceum tickets, of which the
Junior class was in charge. When there was
any money to be collected, he could always
be counted on to collect his share. He is
noted for his unceasing efforts to reach any
goal, which is set before him, for his clear-
headed thinking, and his keen judgment. The
Senior class presidency is an important of-
fice, and requires a lot of work. Only a
live man can competently fill the place. In
electing Parker, the class has chosen a man,
upon which they feel they can rely, and who
is capable of filling the office.

D. G. Wilson, of Atlanta, has also shown
a keen interest ‘in college activities. He has
worked hard on many occasions for the in-
terest of Davidson and his class. As chair-
man of the Junior Speaking committee, he
has displayed some rare ability, and the vice-
Presidency is filled to its capacity by this
man. |
R. W..Graves, of Rome, Ga., is another
honor roll man. Any one who can make
Davidson’s honor. roll has plenty of vim and
vigor. He has a bountiful store of good,
common sense to go with his other talents,
and, as secretary he will be one of the best.

HOLLINGSWORTH ORATES TO.
WIN JUNIOR MEDAL

Popular Speaker from Atlanta Con-_|
tinues His Forensic Success by |
Winning Friday

Hayden Hollingsworth, of Atlanta, Ga.,
won the Junior Orators’ Medal Friday |
morning in the opening feature of what
promises to be one of the best Junior |
Speakings in the history of the college.

Hollingsworth s peaking on the
“Triumph of Idealism” won out with a
forcible speech that won the audience. |
His delivery and subject were both well |
in hand. : |

Five other Juniors spoke Friday morn- |
ing in Shearer for the same honor and}
all delivered speeches that equaled those
of previous years.

Glenn Eddington speaking on “Prog-
ress and Poverty” was one of the best
speakers of the morning.

W. E. Milton spoke on “Samuel Gomp-

| ers,” giving a very entertaining acccount
of some of the ideals of the greatest |

leader of American labor.

Jim Moore followed with a good speech
on “Mecklenburg Declaration of Inde-
pendence.”

J. M. Appleby, one of the leading
scientists of the Junior class chose to
speak on the broad subject of “Science”
and presented some very striking facts
to the audience

Ben Franklin was the last orator of
the day, taking “Abraham Lincoln and
the Constitution” for the subject of a
very beneficial speech.

All in all the Junior Oratorical was one
one the best of many years and much
credit goes to the losing speakers as
well as to Hollingsworth.

Friday Afternoon Dope

It looks as if two boys from the Pied-
mont section of North Carolina will open
Easter Monday’s game on the mound
for both Carolina and Davidson.

While Flake Laird was slated as the
only regular Wildcat hurler and while he
turned in a very welcome win over the
Tar Heels last year, he has not yet stuck
his stride. Laird is from Atlanta.

On the other hand “Lefty” Oden from
Greensboro, the Gate City of the Pied-
mont section, has been .improving all
along. He'‘has been showing some good
stuff and with the proper support should
go well.

Friday morning: reports from the Tar
Heel camp brought word

the game for Carolina,
year on the Carolina varsity. Last sea-
son Holshouser was the premier hurler
of the Freshmen at Chapel Hill. He pit-
ched among several others great games
a not-hit, no-run game against the V. M.
I, Cadets.

The fact that Davidson has been doing
very badly in the first part of the season
may lead Bill Fetzer to risk Holshouser
Monday afternoon.

However the fact that Davidson got

moment that Carolina has won the big-
gest game of the season.

The Wildcats are accustomed to spill-
ing the sporting beans of this state and
more than the ordinarily expected times
these beans are turned out of the Tar
Heels plate.

Sion Alford cracked out a double and
a triple in the State game yesterday af-
ternoon. That brings his hitting on up

to an average of .437. Alford scored two
cf Davidson’s runs.

in the same game Harry Vance, the
leading Wildcat slugger went hitless
with three times credited at the bat.
Wrenn, one of the weak hitters the first
of the season, is picking up, hitting a nice
triple the same game.

game when he made a fine running catch.

Gladstone, State’s second baseman,
who with Holland and Red Johnston was
ineligible when the State crew were at
Davidson, was the hitting feature of the
second game. In four times to the plate
he hit a double and three singles.
