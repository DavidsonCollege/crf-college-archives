Wailey

By gaining 45 yards last week
against Hampden-Sydney, sen-
ior fullback Page Walley ec-
lipsed the Davidson career ru-
shing record of 1378 yards
‘established by’‘Kerry Keith
during the 19661968 seasons.

Walley, a‘psythology major
from La Gralive, Tennessee,
decided to come to Davidson
after a severe knee injury which
destroyed any hopes of playing
for a more esteblished team.
Several impressive scholarship

offers to play at Southeastern .

.Conference schools were re-
scinded following the blow to
his knee. However, Walley de-
cided soon after the accident
that ‘‘he wanted to come to a
good academic school.”
Hearing of Davidson through
friends of the family, Walley
became very interested and
decided to come since it was the
only sure scholarship available.
Walley’s history of athletic
success in high school often
caused second thoughts
throughout his’ career for the
Wildcats. ‘‘I can’t but help

I could have done it.”

In spite of his fantasizing,
Walley seams to be very content
with his decision to come to
Davidson. ‘‘The demanding
combination of academics and
football has given me enough
confidence to do anything. Per-
haps it wouldn’t be like this at a
bigger school.” a

A hard worker both on and
off the field, Walley receives
high accolades from both play-
ers and coaches. Head Coach
Ed Farrell praises Walley by
calling him ‘“‘a very complete
football player at our level of
play. Page contributes in many
areas in which the average fan
wouldn’t be aware of. He is a
good blocker, has good hands,
fakes very well which is an
important part of our offense
and is mechanically very pre-°

Coach Phil Janiero calls a
“hard-nosed runner and a tough

The Davidson Wildcats are
going bowling this season—not
the kind of bowling with a hard
ball with holes in it or the kind

lead.

Saturday night in Charlotte
against Guilford—the Lions

Davidson, coming off of a
23-14 victory over Hampden-
Sydney last weekend in Hamp-
den-Sydney, Va., has now
upped its record to 4-3 overall.

Guilford is coming into the
game with a 3-3 record. -David-
son has a large lead in the series
by winning ten of the 13 games
played between the two schools.
Guilford has won twice and
there has been one tie.

Davidson beat the Quakers
31-0 last year in Greensboro.
Guilford won 26-10 in 1976.

Guilford dropped last week’s
game 27-0 to Randolph-Macon.
Davidson pounded Randolph
Macon earlier in the year 42-0.

Al Rhyne did not start the
game because he was out most
of the practice week with an
injury, but he came in and was
very effective.

Davidson's first score of the
afternoon, coming when Hamp-
den-Sydney held a 7-0 lead,
came on a fake field goal.
Rhyne, the holder on the play,
stood up and fired a pass to
Alvin Atkinson who took it in
for the score.

Rhyne teamed up with ano-
ther one of his receivers during
the second quarter for another
touchdown. Gifford Piercy
grabbed a 44-yard strike from
Rhyne and juggled it into the
end zone for the points.

Davidson’s defense shut
down Hampden-Sydney’s of-
fense in the second half. The
Tigers only managed 26 yards
on the ground after the inter-
mission.

for an ironic reason: the
Wildcats will be heavy favorites
coming into the battle.

“‘We have not played well in
the favorite’s role this year,” he
began. “‘In ail the other games

There ‘is little disagreement
concerning Walley’s ability as a
runner. Another aspect of his
play which draws Walley consi-
derable additional praise is his
consistent dedication to work as
hard as he can in every practice
and in the off-season as well.

during his freshman year harps
on his outstanding personal
qualities: ‘‘Page is a super
person.’’ Then, switching to
Walley’s performance on the
field, Janiero mentions that
“Page was the perfect person to
help establish Coach Farrell’s
Wing-T’ offense.” Colbert ech-
oed Janiero’s views by stating
that “Page is a very honest
person who has paid the price it
takes.”

Quarterback Al Rhyne per-
ceives the important contribu-
tion Walley makes by calling
him ‘‘the backbone of the
offense.”” He then complimen-
ted Walley saying that “Page
very rarely makes a mistake on

However, Walley possesses 4

ary goal consists in going
graduate school in clinical pey-
chology. ‘I hope to later get
involved in private practice and
pethaps do some community
work in a mental
health center in some rural
region.” Possessor of a solid 3.4
grade point average Walley
should have no trouble fulfilling
his aspirations.

Looking back on his few
years of football, Walley cannot
easily suppress all the good
memories he has had. “I really
enjoy being associated with the
guys on the team. During my
freshman year, the team went
out with the attitude ‘Let’s be
respectable.’ Now, we know we -
can beat anybody on our sche-
dule. We are recruiting better
players- and have developed a
winning attitude.’’ He is most
proud of the fact that his ‘‘class
has been the one that has raised
this football program and star-
ted the winning tradition at
Davidson.”

This week Walley leads the
Cats into a Saturday night
benefit contest against the
Guilford Quakers. The Cats are
just beginning to earn national
acclaim as just this :week they
received votes in the division-1
AA weekly rankings. A convin-
cing win could land the Cats a
spot in the top ten.
