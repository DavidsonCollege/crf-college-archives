Thanks For A Job Well Done

With his resignation Tuesday
morning, Dr. Clarence. J. Pietenpol
terminated a period of several years’
service as Davidson's Dean of the
Faculty. During this time he worked
under two presidents of the. college,
and for nearly a year and a half he
headed the administration as Acting
President.

Along with his administrative
work. he carried the additional bur-
den of acting as ehairman of the De-
partment of Physies and of teaching
both freshman and advanced physics
courses. For most of this time he was
the only Ph.D. in the department.

Although it is not known to very
many of us. Dr. Pietenpol held simifar
positions at another school before he
came to Davidson. in 1946 :At.Wash-
ington and Jefferson College, in
Washington... Pennsylvania, he .was
successively Professor of Physics, Di-
rector of Defense Activities. Dean of
the Facultv. Special Assistant to the
President. and finally Acting Presi-
dent.

This administrative career amply
testifies to his talents. And further
evidence of this is available if we
examine his. record at Davidson. for,
although much of the activity of a
Dean of the Faculty is of necessity
concerned with purely routine tasks,
he has plaved a large part in plan-
ning the future of Davidson's intel-

lectual and academic life.

When a man who has served the
college long and well is forced by
sickhess to give up many of his ac-
tivities, we of the student body can
only extend to him our personal sym-
pathy and our gratitude for a job well
done.

Wednesday the Delta Circle of
Omicron Delta Kappa adopted the fol-
lowing resolution, which it presented
in a letter to Dr. Pietenpot:

“We the members of Delta
Circle, Omicron Delta Kappa,
hereby commend Clarence John
Pietenpol for his years of loyal
service as Dean of the Faculty,
Davidson College, and for his
time of selfless devotion as Ac-
ting President during the year
1957-1958. The ultimate benefit
of such dedication to the stu-
dents who pass through David-
son's doors, and the sacrifices Dr.
Pietenpol made are deeply ap-
preciated.”

In addition to this formal resolu-
tion, the letter stated: “It is our hope
that the near future will bring you
renewed health, enabling you to con-
tinue your contribution to Davidson
in your ever important role as a teach-
er.”

The DAVIDSONIAN feels that this
accurately reflects the feelings of the
entire student body.—C.H.C.

A Tragic Climax

The closing of public schools in
certain areas of the South has brought
the segregation-integration battle to
a tense and tragic climax.

In 1954 the people of the South
were presented, so they thought. with
the choice of integrated or segregated
schools. The Supreme Court ruling of
that year was generally regarded by
Southerners as a prod toward event-
ual integration; yet it was understood
that many years would ensue before
that. stated aim would be approached.
The essential element of the Southern
attitude was that, for many years,
there would be a choice between inte-
grated and segregated schools.

Events of recent weeks plainly
show that the choice is an entirely
different one. A people who have tra-
ditionally: regarded education as the
primary requisite for the ‘‘good life,”
an area which produced America’s
greatest champion of public education
as the rock bed of democracy,
Thomas Jefferson. is now faced with
the choice of integrated schools or
no.schoois at all.

The previous question—integration
vs segregation—gave room for valid
arguments in both corners. A knowl-
edge of the “Southern situation” gave
real cause for worry over. the prospect
of immediate integration. The Chris-
tian ethic and the democratic. ethic
lent ample support to those favoring
integration.

These arguments, both arguments, .

are now drowned out by the slam of
school doors across our. land. The
choice is integration or the complete
break down of the public school sys-
tem, to say nothing of utter disregard
for the law of the land. Such a choice
is unfortunate. but it must be made
and lived with.

There can be only one choice un-
der the circumstances. The value of
education, whether it. be integrated

or not, far exceeds the value of hav-
ing an agreeable social environment

during the educational experience.

If education is to be preserved as
an inviolable right of all, it must be
done. Integration seems to be our only
alternative.

The problems will be great, re-
quiring the deepest understanding on
the part of all involved: but it can be
done.

Feet On Floor

With the shift to the new Patter-
son Fraternity Court, at least the|
physical movements of the Davidson
Greeks have been channeled in a new
direction. This year the ideal. if not
the only, opportunity for these fra-
ternity men to start off in a different
direction in what might be termed}
the ‘spiritual’, or intangible realm, for
this has been well tagged “the year
of the precedent” in fraternity life.

With homes that better accomo-
date the sizes of fraternities. let us
assume a maturity that better fits
the nature of the college men we are.|

This intangible spirit of maturity |
can be partially achieved by changes
in certain tangible fields. It is time
we left behind certain inane crudities
which crop up among - fraternities,
but serve no purpose. It is time to
leave behind the barn yard eating
habits of years gone by,

It’s time to learn a due respect for
manners of the home. Right now -the
Greeks’ feet are on the floor rather
than the furniture, but how soon will
the reverence for the new, and prob-
ably mortgaged. furniture wear off?

Within recent years the attitude
toward pledges has proceeded well
along the road of maturity. With con-
tinuance of this trend these neophytes
can be instilled with the respect
and courtesies befitting the Davidson
Gentlemen which we and they sup-
posedly aspire to be. This can be one
of the most important lessons they |
will learn and pass on to succeeding
generations. Better that they learn
this than the shortest distance be-
tween dorm room and Stud. ~ G.W.R.

RESULT OF INCREASED ENROLLMENT

Vespers Condition Brings Opinions Forward

By JACK TAYLOR

Friday morning a week ago
President Martin admitted to
the student body that Vesper
Services, like the dormitories
and lab schedules, had become
a bit crowded. Hearts lifted in
hopeful prayer, but vespers
were not abolished. Juniors and
Seniors did receive one free
“cut.” though.

The resolution which allowed
the “cuts” was adopted by the
Religious Life Committee and
was approved by the Executive
Committee of the Faculty as a
temporary solution to the prob-
lem of extremely crowded ves-
per services. The temporary
measures were to allow more
time for serious consideration
of possible long-term solutions,
which were listed in the com-
mitice’s resolution.

ABOLITION

What did publie opinion have
to say about the committee's
action and about the suggested
sohittons? Many, students were

indifferent. AS one junior put.

i. 1 don’t really care., I've
ofily. got to ‘attend four more
vespers anyway.”' Others had
devoted. some thought to the
problem and were strongly
opinionated. Suggestions
ranged (rom “knocking out a
wall and putting more seats in
the church” to the abolition of
required vespers.

to hear the

Probably the most popular of
the proposed solutions was ves-
per attendance credit for Sun-
day morning church, either in
Davidson or elsewhere. This
would give the student more
freedom than he now ehjoys,
allowing him a choice of time,
place. and faith. Drawbacks of
this plan are, first, the approval
of the various church bodies
and the townspeople .must be
gained: some feel that there
might be resentment among lo-
eal church groups towards a
“captive audience working off
an obligation.” Many townspco-
ple would rather keep their
morning services pure in spirit.

Also, as Dave Robinson point-
ed out. if the locale were limit-
ed to Davidson, it might not al-
leviate the number of students
attending the night vesper ser-
vice; the majority of students
would probably sleep through
Sunday morning services rath-
er than -attending. Those who
did attend the morning church
services. would possibly desire
evening speaker.
therefore. the number attend-
Ing evening vespers. would not
be appreciably decreased.

SENIOR EXEMPTION

Another suggestion was a
blankel exemption for Seniors.
or first. semester exemptions for
Seniors and second semester
exemptions for Juniors. Antag-

onists of this plan’ believe
that under such requirements
students would look forward to
the time when they wauld no
longer be required to attend
the services, and would come
to think of Vespers as some-
thing they outgrew. Thus Ves-
pers would “lose one of its
essential values—that of train-
ing the personality in the habit
of church-going.”

Conversely, Dr. Staples, who
is a strong advocate of Senior
exemption, feels that. “if we
haven't established —_ certain
value patterns by the time they
(students) are Seniors, we aren’t
going to be able to do a whole
lot beyond that point.”

A solution very similar to
‘the temporary action undertak-
en by the Religious Life Com-
mittee would give Seniors free
cuts on the Sundays with the
heaviest attendance, the first
forr, and on dance weekends.
Combined with their already al-
lowed seven cuts. this plan
~vould practically give the Sen
dors a blanket exomption.

OOUBLE SERVICE

A variation on the idea of
church attendance credit is a
double service, whereby the
vesper speaker would conduct.
two services in the evening, or
possibly. the Y.M.C.A. might
conduct one of the services. At-
tendance at either  serviee

Exchange Student Writes
On German, U.S. Athletics

Editor's Note:

This is the first in a se-
ries of articles by the new
foreign students at David-
son.

By Ernst-Helge Schoenfelder

As I found out after my first
two weeks on campus, sports
play a significant part in the
lives of many students at Da-
vidson College. I was especially
impressed by the excellent
equipment the college can of-
fer to every student in any
sport which he may choose. |
wonder why under such splen-
did conditions it is necessary
to activate the students’ partici-
pation in sports through college
authority.

FIRST FOOTBALL GAME

Last week I saw the first
American football game in my
life.

As I did not know anything
about the rules of this game.
I fete like a newborn baby,
watching a funny spectacle; two
gaily jumping teams in warm
winter dress, falling down onto
their knees and suddenly run-
ning one into the other, form-
ing piles of human bodies which

PEANUTS

were lying one on the other.

A very kind fraternity man
sitting next to me made fruit-
less attempts to explain the
sense of all the trouble to me
with the only success that I
came to understand: in the end:
Davidson had lost the war!

However, I do hope that from
my personal stupidity you will
not conclude that all Germans
are such feeble-minded individ-
uals.

FUSSBALL

We also play “Fussball” in
Germany, but you would have
to translate it with “soccer.”
Unfortunately I don't take any
interest in soecer, and there-
fore consider myself to be a
very bad representative of my
country, since in Germany soc-
cer takes indisputably
place in popular sports. In West
Germany alone there are some
13.000 soccer clubs, with a to-
tal of about 900.000 active play-
ers

You may remember that in
1954 the West German soccer
team succeeded in winning the
world championship in Switzer-
land, thus sending hundreds of
thousands of Germans into a

state of delirious enthusiasm.

The cake ‘race last week also
was a terrific experience for
me. Although the foreigh stu-
dents are not classified (but
range from freshmen to seniors
as oceasion demands). I
felt like a freshman who should
not shirk this outstanding
event. Half way, already being
rather exhausted, I felt very
much like giving up. But an
undefinable feeling that in this
competition I was running not
only for Germany, but for Eu-
rope, kept me going.

The cake, however, repaid
such exertion and, in a solemn
ceremony. was unanimously

consumed by the assembled
representatives of Europe and
Latin Ameriea.

To conclude, I would encour-
age all the readers of this up-
to-date newspaper to bring
forth their questions and wish-
es they have concerning our
countries and to make sugges-

ions as to the subjects and kind.

would count toward a student's
obligation.

This plan would eliminate
any exemptions and is favored
by those who are afraid that
the problem of crowds might
be used as a mechanism to

prize out compulsory vespefs.
The exponents of this plan feel
that compulsory vespers should
be judged on its own merits,
and not by the fact that in-
creased enrollment has crowded
a limited seating area.

THE SPECTATOR

Runaway Frosh Finds No
Escape From Court's Wrath

By TOM KERNAN
I was in my room the other night, counting the laun-
dry's latest ventilative efforts on my personal apparel,
when I heard a frenzied pounding on my door. Opening
it, | found the shivering form of Winston Small, member

of the class of ‘62.

“Quick.” he panted, “Let me in. Please, they'll find

me!”

“Rush Week is over, Winston,” 1 said. “Go home.”

“No.” he said, “you don't understand; the Court of
Control is after me. Even as he spoke, my ear detected
the faint baying of hounds coming from the confines of
East. I intended to leave him to his fate, but,the imploring
look in his eyes melted my resolve, and I let him into the

room.

“What aré they after you for?” I asked.
‘T forgot to speak to an upperclassman,” he moaned,
wringing his hands. ‘‘What am I going to do?”
“Hmmm, that reminds ‘me of good old Charlie Hartug,”
I answered. “When he was a freshman, he came up be-
fore the court for not speaking to an upperclassman. It

out.

of .Control.”

THE PHILOSOPHES

was the very first meeting, too. and Marvin Maul, David-
son’s greatest tackle, was judge of the court that year.

Well. he finally called Charlie’s name and, sure
enough, there came Charlie walking down the aisle,
looking just as solemn.as an owl. He took off his cap and
stood there while Marvin read the charge against him for
not speaking to this upperclassman. Then Marvin kind
of roared out—“How do you plead, Freshman?”

Charlie just stood there, not saying a word. Marvin
asked him again, only louder—same result, not a sound.
Finally, Marvin kind of inflated himself and this time he
yelled it so loud that onc.af the older janitors in the back
of the auditorium got the hiccoughs and had to be taken

Then Charlie looked up at. Marvin, with a sad little
smile on his face, and started gesturing with his hands
and making guttural noises in the back of his throat.

It got so quiet, you could have heard a grade drop.
Marvin turned sort of white in the face and mumbled

something about being sorry. One of the other members
of the court came down off the stage and escorted Charlie
up the aisle, Charlie still gesturing with his hands and
making those kind of slobbery noises in his throat.

Of course, they caught up with him after awhile, but
he sure fixed them for that meeting. Give yourself up,
boy; nobody, not even Charlie Hartug, escapes the Court

Winston thanked me for the advice and squaring his
shoulders, marched manfully into the night.

Alternatives Suggested

For Curriculum Needs

By DABNEY STUART

Any purposeful change in
curriculum involves . initiative
on the part of both faculty and
student. Two general methods
possible to each group present
themselves out of the probable
mass of alternatives.

First. the faculty as a body
could impose structural change
upon the existing composite of
students. primarily by the ad-
dition of new courses to the
curriculum, or by substitution
of revamped courses for old
ones.

Second, individual facul-
ty members could work ex-
perimentally and pragmati-
cally with individual stu-
dents and or classes. If a
tentative change, which is
what such an approach
would embody, is success-
ful, propose it; if not, dis-
card the idea. In other
words, in the second in-
stance, precede formal
course change with infor-
mal (individual) experimen-

tation.
The student's main organ for
stimulating change is_his

mouth. He may verbally agitate
for change in curriculum that
he believes is necessitated by
either his own perceived need,
or by knowledge of curriculum
offered at other institutions,
Secondly, companion to thé

THE CEILING!

second option of the faculty, a
student may expcriment with
specific programs and under-
take to evaluate the results of
his work. Again pragmatic prin-
ciples are employed.

Probably a combination of
all these possibilities is the
most advisable manner in which
to approach the problem. The
uniting of them into directive
policy requires time, a consid-
erable amount of it.

The present period of
transition in the Davidson
College administrative
area necessitates not only
sn acute ewareness of a
need for patience, but also
a renewed study of the cur-
riculum from the ground
up. However, the fact that
immediate action cannot be
expected should not offer
itself as an excuse for no
action at alf.

One suggestion for approach
would be to allow some mem-
ber(s) of the faculty time off
from teaching duties to devote
their entire energies to the
problem. The present Curri-
culum Committee is unable to
offer consistent concentrated
attention that the problem de-
mands. (Of course, this opens
the need for men to fill the
faculty vacancies thus created.)

Obviously, the situation re-
quires patience on the part of
the student, a quality difficult
for a man whose four years are
once and precious to him to in-
corporate. However, patience
does not imply passive waiting.
It means partially to replace the
verbal expression so widely
abused with more persistent
dedication to the immediate
work at hand, to that which the
words too often replace instead
of symbolize.
