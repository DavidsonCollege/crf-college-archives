alleged that they were unfairly
disciplined for circulating a
petition among co-workers last
January. The petition criticized
procedures for getting pay-
checks and punching time
clocks.

Later last January they were
put on probation, reprimanded
twice, and given lesser jobs.
However, their salaries and
seniority were not affected.

The College issued a state-
ment explaining the actions
were taken because the three
employees ‘‘...interrupted the
orderly flow of work, tended to
undermine the authority of
supervision, were offensive to
fellow workers, and contributed
to a state of tension and poor
morale in the department.”

In March Spencer appointed
a grievance committee which
removed one of the reprimands
and reinstated Alexander to his
old job as an electrician.

Rolland filed a charge with
the NLRB in June. After an
investigation by an NLRB field
examiner, the NLRB filed a
complaint against the College in
August, charging it with illegal-
ly discouraging ‘‘employees
engaged in concerted activities
with other employees for the
purpose of collective bargaining
and other mutual aid and
protection.”

for extra money or else pay
expenses out of his own pocket.
His absences during recruiting
trips were Jater cited as one
reason for his firing.

Kremser was hired to coach
both soccer in the fall and track
in the spring. Although he
maintains he was told to view
track as secondary and to con-
centrate on soccer, his initially
sporadic committment to the
the track program was another
reason given for his dismissal.
Kremser insists that a good
soccer coach must be committed
to that sport twelve months a
year. to enable him to coach,
recruit, and prepare. His super-
iors obviously disagree.

The degree of Kremser’s in-
compatibility with the David-
son athletic program became
apparent when his contract was
not renewed. During various
meetings with Cartmill and
members of the Administration
Kremser requested and was
given several reasons for his
firing, including his absences
during recruiting, concentration
on .soccer to the exclusion of
track, possible personality con-
flicts, and the quitting of se-

The College’s attorneys offer-
ed to settle out of court the
week before the hearing, accord-
ing to Rolland’s attorney, Louis
Lesesne. The employees refused
the College’s offer, however,
because it would not reinstate
McIntosh, a plumber, to his
original job.

The final settlement put Mc-
Intosh in a job similar to his
original one. Rolland, formerly
a,mechanic, will continue work-
ing in the Union, where he has
been since last January.

“There’s no doubt in my
mind that the College violated
the National Labor Relations
Act,” Rolland said. Both he and
McIntosh said they wished a
trial had taken place so the
College’s violations could have
been shown.

However, the statement issu-
ed by Spencer’s office said,
“The settlement - incorporates
the College’s position that it has
not at any time violated: the
provisions ef the National La-
bor Relations Act.”’

McIntosh said he was upset
that such a ‘‘dippy thing’’ had
taken so long to settle. ‘‘This
could have been worked out at a
lower level,’’ Rolland added.
Both were concerned about the
amount of money the College
spent in legal fees.

veral senior soccer players this
fall. Kremser claims.he was able
to satisfactorily rebut each of
the alleged problems. Finally,
he says, he was told the college
had no obligation to justify its
decision.

Something is unsettling
about this incident. Although
some may claim the decision to
fire Kremser was arbitrary,
those who made it have ob-

served enough alleged problems |

to feel that such an action was

‘ warrantéd. The tragedy is that

these problems were not
brought to Kremser’s attention
earlier, or if they were pointed
out, their severity was not made
clear. It is doubtful that Krem-
ser would have continued doing
anything that he explicitly
knew would result in his dis-
missal.

Perhaps Kremser is at fault
here for failing to keep his ear to
the ground and detect these
problems before they overwhel-
med him. Perhaps other coaches
wil take note this tendency and
work to alleviate it. At the
moment, however, Kremser is
out of a job and Davidson has
lost a dynamic and knowledge-
able coach.

Is hunger a problem in the
United States? According to
Senator Ernest Hollings, in his
book The Case Against Hunger,
“millions of Americans are
hungry, and early scientific

‘indications are that the general

nutrition in this country is
worse than it was at the close of
World War II.” Hollings re-
ports results from the National
Nutrition Survey, whose direc-
tor, Dr. Arnold Schaefer, has
stated that the nutrition prob-
lems among the poor in the
United States ‘‘seem to be
similar to those we have en-
countered in the developing
countries.”’

The two most serious nutri-
tional diseases are Kwashior-
kor, caused by sever, long-term
protein deficiency, and maras-
mus, which results primarily
from prolonged lack of food
calories. ‘‘Both,’’ Senator Hol-
lings points out, ‘‘are rare
exceptions except in famine
conditions. But bothe were
found by doctors of the nutri-
tion survey, here in our great
and bounteous land.”

Early samplings from the
survey (collected in Diet for a
Small Planet by Frances Moore
Lappe) showed that of families
earning under $3,000 a year,
more than 16% had serious
protein deficiencies—some well
below the levels normally asso-
ciated with malnutrition in un-
derdeveloped countries. Bone
underdevelopment and swollen
bellies due to protein or calorie
malnutrition were observed in
4-5%. .

now, there is no way that the
United States can go without
the oil we import from the Mid-

tic sacrifices), nor should we
have to. It would be taking a
giant step backwards to with-

According to junior Pat Sher-
idan, around 8:45 ‘‘some friends
and I decided to build a little
bonfire to keep warm. Students
started bringing wood, legal
wood, and when everbody
started leaving the library, they
all came over to the fire.”’

“No one was drunk or had
really been drinking when we
started the fire,’”’ Sheridan said.
“It was like just a family
gathering. With all the lights
out, where else was there for
everybody to go?”

According to Davidson Fire
Chief Robert Gurley,.a concern-
ed student called the fire de-
partment about the fire. Since
the firemen were answering an
emergency call and did not
know the exact nature of the
fire, they had no choice but to
come put it out. The fire truck
arrived around 10:15 p.m.

‘The fire company coming
was a catalyst,” Sheridan said.
‘‘That’s when people started
getting mad and upset.”

“The fire was too close tothe
dormitory ,”’ Gurley said. ““They
threw beer and water on us. The
stepped all over our hoses, and
they booed at us when we put
the fire out.” —

two-to-three hundred students
present started the fire again.
The fire department received
another call from a student and
returned around 11:15 p.m.
Griffin said he told them once
again not to come, that it*‘was
not a riot or anything like
that.”

Upon returning to the fire,
the fire fighters faced a more
hostile crowd. Someone threw a
liquor bottle that smashed into
the running board of the’ fire
truck. Rather than ask the
crowd to clear away from the
fire, the firemen opened up with
their hoses. They succeeded in
putting out the fire, but many
of the people encircling the fire
got wet, and the crowd ‘grew
more angry.

According to one student
present, ‘‘I grabbed the fireman
with the hose and tried to get

him to wait until everybody got

away from the fire.” Instead the

fireman sprayed him in the
head, knocking him to the
