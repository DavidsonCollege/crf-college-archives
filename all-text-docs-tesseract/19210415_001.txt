Eleven Students Speak at
Interesting “Y” Service

Echoes from Greenville Laymen’s Con-
vention Given by Davidson’s . ,;
Representatives

“Over ninety-five per cent of the
church members of today have never
personally brought a soul to Jesus
Christ! To which group do you be-
long?” This is but one of the many
gripping statements that made last Sun-
day’s “Y” service one of such great in-
terest. Eleven men who were delegates
to the recent Laymen’s Missionary Con-
vention at Greenville, S. C,, presented to
the students, in brief two-minute
speeches, the thoughts they had received
there which had meant most to them.

Probably the most prominent char-
acteristic of the meeting was the earn-
estness with which every man spoke,
and every speaker seemed to have got-
ten a message from the convention
which had already meant much in his
life. .

The chief point brought out was that
the great need of the Church today is
more consecrated, hard-working mem-
bers, members who feel their own per-
sonal responsibility to God. It is evident
that heretofore too much of the respon-
sibility for the human soul has been laid
on the overworked ministers, and that
the importance of personal work by lay-
men has been too little emphasized:

All the fellows who attended the
Greenville convention were greatly
pleased with the spirit in which the lay-
men are getting into harness, and plans
are now being formulated to have a
special service in the near future con-
ducted by several practical busines® men
who have come to realize the true great-
ness of the task in hand.

BAND TAKES FOUR-DAY TRIP
TO SURROUNDING CITIES.

The Davidson College Band left the
campus on the morning of Tuesday,
April 12th for an extended trip through
the state, not returning until Friday
night. The first concert was scheduled
to be held at Mitchell College, States-
ville, Tuesday evening. Leaving there
the next morning they were scheduled to
sound forth their tuneful lays before
the fair feminine student body of Ienoir
College, located at Hickory. Thursday
night they were scheduled to a return
engagement at the Lincolnton High
School, having been recalled by special
request. On their homeward journey
they expect to stop over at the Queen
City for the purpose of hearing the
famous Pryor’s Band, Friday morning.
The last concert of the trip will be giv-
en at Sharon Church, just outside Char-
lotte. The church plans to hold a re-
ception for the band after the program.
After leaving the church they will re-
turn to Davidson late that night, via
auto, thus completing what is hoped to
be the most successful trip of the sea-

Workmen were busy two or three
days last week repairing Phi Hall. The
fire did very little damage but it was
quite a lot of trouble to repair it as
part of the old tin roof had to be torn
off and new rafters put in place of those
damaged by the flames.

The new tin roof makes quite a con-
trast beside the old one and the rest of
the hall. Old Phi has stood there many
a day and it is to be hoped that this
old landmatk will remain for many
more.

Regular Football Game
to be Played on
Sprunt Field

Varsity and Scrubs to Meet in Spring
Practice Battle Saturday

“Touchdown! Touchdown! We want
a touchdown!” These and similar yells
will be heard on Sprunt Field Saturday
afternoon rain or shine.

“Where did he get his mountain dew,
this is not November.”

Yes, but all the same, fellows, Coach
Grey has scheduled a real live football
game for the last day of the week be-
tween the varsity and scrubs. And
what's more, it gives promise to be a
bloody affair, because when the Wild-
cats hook up with the Kittens, fur is
bound to fly.

This is not the whole menu, either;
everybody will be there, so come out of
your hole and boost your favorite.

The men have been whipped into
splendid shape after two weeks of
strenuous practice, and are ready and
anxious for the fray. The rivals have
been practicing trick plays, so there is
promise of a very sensational battle.
Also, off-tackle plays, circling end runs,
and the always famous Davidson aerial
attack will come into play.

Everybody come out and see the lively
fray, and if you see an M.D. bring him
along, and we can have the good ol’
“Hail, Hail, the Gangs all here,” just
once more before we visit the ol’ swim-
ming hole.

FRENCH CIRCLE CHOOSES
NEW OFFICERS
AND MEMBERS

The French Circle elected their offi-
cers for the coming year at their regular
meeting last Friday night. The follow-
ing men were chosen to lead the circle
in its work for the coming year: R. R.
Mcliwaine, president; R. R. Deaver,
vice-president; E. E. Houghton, ‘sec-
retary; A. C. Summers, treasurer.

Three new members were initiated in-
to the circle. These were, C. D. Tuller;
S. M. Query, and E. E. Houghton. The
two latter gentlemen gave solo-dances
which proved highly amusing to the
house. Among other features of the
meeting was a song, written by M.
Villemin, comicly rendered by Tucker.
Houston White gave a report on his
recent New York trip made in the in-
terest of the French circle.

Among the alumni seen at the game in
Charlotte fast Saturday were: RD.
Hall, ‘19; F. P. Hall, ‘19; A. L. Foscue,
‘20; E. M. White, ex-’20; T. H. Spence,
‘20; W. M. Hall, '20; J. C McMaster,
ex-'20; A. G. Oltman, ex-’23; C. H. Bar-
ringer, ex-'23; H. Whitner, ex-'23; Ted
Cashion, '18; O P Hart, '2o.

Thirteen Men Contend for Medal.—
D. H. Ogden Winner, With W. M.
Cox and D. B. Walthall Following.

The Eumenean Fresh-Soph declama-
tion contest held last Monday night in
Shearer Hall proved to be one of the
most spirited and enthusiastic contests
held within the wails of that venerable
building in many years.

From the first to the last of the 13
speakers, the walls of the old chapel
echoed with frequent bursts of oratory
which would have done honor to the
presence of such renowned speakers as
Henry W. Grady, Woodrow Wilson, or
R. T. L. Liston.

D. H. Ogden was chosen by the judges
as the best speaker of the evening and
in accordance with the old custom of
the society, an appropriate medal will be
awarded him. W. M. Cox and D. B.
Walthall were named as the two next
best declaimers, winning the distinction
of “honor speakers.”

The declamation delivered by Ogden
was that of “Prentice in the Mississippi
Contested Election.” Held under the
spelt of the forceful and striking de-
livery the audience imagined themselves
within the walls of the capitol .itself,
straining to catch every utterance of the
author himself.

All of the selections showed particular
preparation and were delivered in a
manner which reflects credit upon the
society.

The judges were Professors Hunt, Lin-
gle, and Shewmake. The contestants
were as follows: Ogden, Warner, Wild-
man, A. C.; Moore, W. H.; Hudgins,
Walthall, D. B.; Elkins, Cox, Easley,
Morris, R. H.; Frazer, Mé6rris, Z. A.;
Smith, R. H.

Glee Club Stages Concert
and Banquet in Charlotte

Program Delights High School Stu-
dents—Banquet is Sump-
tuous Affair

The Glee Club gave a splendid enter-
tainment at the Alexander Graham High
School in Charlotte last Friday night.
The club left here on the 4:20 train, ar-
riving in Charlotte about 5:30.

A joke was pulled on the crowd by
Manager Matthews. It was rumored
that he had arranged for the men to
stop at the Selwyn. After having stop-
ped there for a few minutes, they dis-
covered the joke and gathered up their
belongings and went to another hotel.

The program was full of pep from be-
ginning to end. The audience, though
rather small, was unusually appreciative
and this inspired the boys to do their
best.

The feature of the trip to Charlotte
was the splendid banquet supper which
the members of the club enjoyed. It
was given at the Raleigh, and certainly
nothing was lacking in the line of “eats.”
The table was so heavily laden with
good things that it seemed to groan un-
der its #eevy load. However, it’s suf-
fering was not of tong endurance, for
with such hearty eaters as are members
of the Glee Club, the disappearance of
the food seemed miraculous, and soon
the cigars were passed, which indicated
the end of this perfect meal.

R. W. McKay, ‘17, of Sumter, S. C,
passed through Charlotte a few days
ago. The Charlotte Observer remarks
that “In person and bearing he could be
chosen as a model type of soldier, so
superbly tall, erect, commanding, and
handsome.”

Four Men for Tennis Team

Chosen in Semi-Finals

Ormond, Cunningham, Roberts and
Morris Overcome All Opponents

The tennis team has finally been picked
and the men are working every day in
an effort to get in good form for the
matches this spring. The spring tourna-
ment is almost completed, only one
match yet to be played off. This match
is the final one between Cunningham
and A.C. Ormond. Both these men have
played and won four matches during the
course of the tournament and thus are
entitled to a try at the college champ-
ionship.

The four men who reached the semi-
finals compose the team. These men
are Cunningham, Ormond, Morris, and
Bill Roberts. The results of the third
round and the semi-finals are as follows:

Cunningham vs. Brown—Cunningham
6-0, 6-2.

Ormond vs. Frazer—Ormond 5-7, 6-2,
6-4.

Morris vs. Meyers—Morris 12-10, 6-3.

Roberts vs. Gaither—Roberts 6-2, 6-2.

Semi-Finals.

Cunningham vs. Roberts—Cunningham
4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4.

Ormond vs Morris—Ormond 6-2, 6-1,
108,

The first intercollegiate match will be
tomorrow with Lenoir College at Hick-
ory. All four men will make the trip
and the chances for bringing home a
victory are bright.

DR. FRASER HOOD TALKS TO
SALESMEN’S CLUB.

On Monday night in Dr. McConnell’'s
history room in Shearer Hall, Dr Fraser
Hood of the facutly addressed the mem-
bers of the Salesmen’s Club and about
7o other men on the general subject of
Salesmanship, a subject to which Dr.
Hood has given much scientific study
and a line of work in which he has had
actual experience. He spoke of the four
steps usually considered as included in
selling: getting attention, creating in-
terest, arousing desire, and the action of
closing the sale. He spoke of the close
relationship between attention and in-
terest. A number of good suggestions
for “putting over” sales were given. It
is hoped that many other such talks
will be given. After the address a con-
stitution for the Salesmen's Club was
adopted.

Pitchers’ Battle at Wearn Field—
Crawford Ties Elon Game:
With Three-Bagger

Murray, of A. and E. and Currie, of
Davidson staged a pitcher’s battle in
Charlotte Saturday in which the former
was the victor by the count of 3-0. Mur-
ray pitched one of the best games of his
career, and in addition to allowing only
three hits, no two of which came in the
same inning, he struck out ten and gave
no free passes. Currie also pitched well,
allowing only five hits, striking out
three and walking two. But on two
occasions State succeeded in getting
two of these hits in one reel with the
result that markers were pushed across
the rubber both times.

The game was the best exhibition of
the national pastime seen in Charlotte
this year. It was marked by air-tight
pitching and skillful fielding. Altho two
errors are chalked up against cach team,
none of these miscues affected the final
result.

Murray was State. This veteran of
the college diamond pitched a brand of
ball that wins him a place among the
foremost pitchers in the state. He de-
pended mainly upon his change of pace,
but he had a baffling assortment of
hooks and curves. But without their
star slabman, State would have only a
mediocre team. He is the one star
among a cluster of “fair to middling”
ball-tossers. ¢

Buck Currie pitched well enough to
win any ordinary game but the Wildcat
sluggers were way off form. It would
be hard to believe that it was the same
team that collected 16 hits in one game
earlier in the week. Time and again
Pat, Jake, and other sluggers who can
usually be counted to pole the spheroid
to the grassy outpost failed to deliver /
when hits meant runs.

Davidson runners reached first but
four times and second but twice, and
here their progress stopped. On each
occasion two were gone by the board
before the Presbyterian \reached the
initial sack. Cop Johnson and Sim
Wrenn pined away at first; Brown
stole second and Cassell reached the
keystone. sack when Redfern dropped
Carson’s throw. In the other five in-
nings it was a case of three up and
three down for Davidson.

State got five hits, two of which were
