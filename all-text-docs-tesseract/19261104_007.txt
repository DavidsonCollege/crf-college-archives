The Tigers, averaging about 168 pounds,
outweigh the Wildcats by seven pounds to the
man, yet this is counterbalanced by the speed
and agility of the Davidson eleven.

An interesting feature of the game is the
fact that Coach C. A. Bernier, of Hampden-
Sidney, coached the entire trio of Davidson

Canes and Derbies

| At a class meeting. Tuesday morning
{the Seniors voted to adopt canes and
|derbies as their distinctive garb during
ithe coming year. Special coats, sweaters
| and blazers were also suggested, but
| failed to receive the approval of the class.
The design of the canes and derbies has
hot yet been officially adopted.

Each year during the past decade it
has been customary for the Seniors to
adopt some official garment but it has
been five years since any class has ap-
peared with canes and derbies. The class
of 1922 was the last on record to pass
upon this form of attire. Since that
time sweaters and special coats have
prevailed. |Last year the Seniors adopted
blue jackets trimmed with orange, these
being the class colors.

While some of Davidson’s alumni have
i been very loyal and shown interest in all
her Pe ie there are thousands who
| have never taken any part in the work of
| their Alma. Mater, and who have never
contributed to her upkeep.
