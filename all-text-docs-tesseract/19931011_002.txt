Storyteller

. By Court McBryde

Sociology professor Nancy
Fairley gave the Davidson College
community a taste of her
storytelling talent Sunday after-
noon at the BSC.

Co-sponsored by the Anthro-
pology/Sociology Department and
the BSC, the storytelling series is
new to the college.

Fairley began telling stories
as a parent in New York. When
one of her friends, a poet, heard
Fairley’s stories, she invited her to
present them to a group of poets in
Brooklyn.

Since then Fairley has per-
formed her stories at outside festi-
vals, public schools, brunches at
restaurants, birthdays, family gath-
erings, and “about any other set-
ting you can imagine,” Fairley com-
mented. Over the last two years,
storytelling has become a profes-
sion for Fairley.

Spins her tale at BSC

She explains that storytelling
isa human community of art forms
which allows people to bond. “It
opens up a world of fantasy and
enables all to enter other people’s
lives, other societies, and other
cultures,” Fairley remarked. She
added that storytelling unleashes
the imagination’s creativity for
both the performer and spectator.

Some of the stories Fairley
presents are self-composed while
others have been passed down
through many generations.
Fairley’s interest in stories lies in
anthropology's folklore.

Fairley now performs under
the stage name "Nani," her
grandmother’s name which she did
not previously use because of her
grandmother’s wishes. After her
grandmother’s death, she picked
up Nanias herstoryteller perform-
ing name.

Bornin Maxton, N.C., Fairley

is currently investigating an at-
tempted Ku Klux Klan march
stopped by the Lumbees Indians
when she was only eight years old.

Fairley is collecting personal stud- :

ies to weave into this historical
event in order to formulate another
story.

A first year professor at
Davidson and new to the area,
Fairley was anxious to get herself
back into public storytelling and
was thrilled to perform at the BSC,
which was looking for an act to
encourage students to come to the
house.

Fairley attended Clark Col-
lege in Atlanta and went to gradu-
ate school in anthropology at State
University of New York at Stony
Brook. She continued graduate
work in Ghana, Africa. The BSC
will also be hosting storytellers
Sonny Wood, “Sauni,” and E. J.
Stewart on Sunday as well.

Committee uses student input for apartments

Beds continued from page 1

cuts down on the total number of
toilets and sinks.

Having 5 people in an apart-
ment does create other problems.
Since the Martin Court apartments
only have 4 bedrooms, the lottery
for apartments will have to be re-
vised.

“We know we need to work
on that part of the system,” says
Facilities and Housing Operations
Coordinator Debby Sink. “It could
get really complicated and lottery
is not the time to get complicated.”

No revisions have been made

yet, but students will be notified of
the changes in the Lottery Hand-
book which is distributed in the
Spring. This leaves juniors who
are abroad next semester in amess
as far as housing is concerned.

Aside from the Lottery quan-
dary, the committee hopes these
apartments will add a few features
that students may have missed in
the Martin Court apartments.

To determine what was miss-
ing, they distributed a question-
naire to the occupants of Martin
Court.

Although most residents were
very satisfied with their living ar-

rangements, several did cite prob-
lems with parking and thin walls.
As a result, it is very likely that
more parking will be added.

The inclusion of students on
the housing committee is a big
step for student voice in campus
decision-making. No students
helped make these kinds of deci-
sions in 1988, when the first apart-
ments were constructed.

Student response is positive.

“The initial reaction I get is,
‘Does this mean we're going toget
a senior apartment?’ and I nod,
and they are ecstatic,” says
Heitzenroder.

SCIENCE OR FRAUD? ‘The Chemistry department featured Dr.
Stuart Fleming in Chambers Gallery Wednesday. Fleming spoke on
forgery in art, focusing on ceramics, coinage, and painting. Several
"famous" forgeries were mentioned, including the shroud of Turin,
thought to be the burial covering of Christ, but actually carbon-
dated to the 14th century. He added, "counterfeiting is one of the
most sophisticated sciences." He spoke with Dr. Ralph Gable of the
Chemistry department after the lecture.
