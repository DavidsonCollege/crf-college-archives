GOING GREEK:
A LITTLE TASTE OF ATHENS -

By Rachel Newcomb

Ican remember attending sev-
eral Greek festivals when I was
little, in Charlotte as well as in
Columbus, Ohio. They tend torun
together in my memory now, but I
have dim recollections of the big
tents, -traditional folk music,
brightly-colored caftans for sale,
and the food—tables piled high
with baklava, meat and cheese past-
ries, salad, souvlaki, and wine.

This year was the first time in
several years that Ihave been back
to the Greek Festival in Charlotte.
As far as I’m concerned, food is
still the main event, but there are

Held last weekend at the Holy
Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral,
the 17-year-old festival features
costumed dancers, music, and tours
of the church. There were rooms
set up: within the church selling
traditional Greek clothes, tapes,
authentic pottery, cookbooks, reli-
gious icons, and more.

A “bakaliko,” a type of gro-
cery store, sold such staples as feta

‘cheese, salad dressing, and frozen

pastries.
Outside under a big tent, th
musicians and dancers performed
to a well-fed audience. Greek
music is extremely diverse, with
influences running the gamut from

other attractions as well.

Patrick Donley's "Cys ical

By George Weld

When I first walked into
Patrick Donley’s show in the Ed-
ward M. Smith Gallery inthe VAC,
I couldn’t help thinking of this
time last year, when one of Cort
' Savage’s immaculately crafted
sculptures was installed there. That
sculpture periodically spat balls
onto the floor, so that after a while,
the room seemed filled with them.

The gallery this year is filled
again with balls, one in each of
Donley’s paintings—they domi-
nate the paintings and unify the
entire show. 5

In fact, this is one of the most

unified exhibits I’ve ever seen, -

** visually and themati-
cally: all of the
_ paintings are
bright andar-
resting, and
_ their tex-
‘tures are
similar.
Most are
multi-media
works, incorporating
collages (including prints of works
-\by Botticelli, Hokusai, and Will-
iam Blake), and many include a
curious petroglyph-esque spiral,
meant, I suppose, to reflect the

central thematic concerns of this
show, which is called "Cyclical
Nature.”

The paintings themselves
make these concerns fairly clear:
regeneration, life processes, and
the nature of history.

In one painting, Homme
Moyen Sensuel, photographs of a
man in various stages of life spiral
outward from the center of the
painting’s central sphere; he be-
gins in the center as a baby, and at
the outer edge of the sphere, .he is
an old man, his face distorted, his

- individuality blurred.

Inanother, Chrysalis, ayoung
girl stands in a clamshell, a la The
Birth of Venus; over her head is a

butterfly (which, I noticed
with interest, is a real but-
terfly glued onto the can-
vas), and on the very
edge of the painting an-
other butterfly seems
about to fly out of the
frame. —
Thematically, these
two paintings are fairly typi-
cal, and their techniques—use
of the spiral motif, references
to canonical art—are as well.

The spheres serve various pur-

poses in each painting; sometimes

they work interestingly, sometimes
not. In the painting, Nature Morte,
the sphere is filled with cut-outs of

various still-lifes—fruit in various .

arrangments, Matisse’s goldfish—
which are all instances of nature
rendered through art, sub-

jugated by the imagina-

tion.

Outside of the
sphere are prints of pho-
tographs of a flower,
birch trees, andtwo pieces
of actual birch’bark.

These, I suppose, represent
nature in its wildness, untamed by
the human imagination. Interest-
ingly, these outside images cross
the boundary of the sphere, in-
fringing onthe realm of the human.
The blurring of boundaries is evi-
dent in other paintings, as well—
Donley embellishing and extend-
ing the hair of Botticelli’s Venus,

for instance, or filling in the legs

of flying devils in a paint-

ing by Signorelli. These

paintings violate the

boundaries that separate

“high” or classical art

from contemporary art,

codépting the ancient for use by the
cutting edge.

Unfortunately, instead of feel-

Botticelli

Ature" exhibit in the VAC

ing cutting edge or provocative,
these paintings seemed boring.
They are arresting but not endur-
ing; they grab one’s interest but do
not keep it.

‘The clean, meticuluous execu-

tion that made Savage’s
sculpture last year
interesting has the
effect in these paint-
ings of making them
seem stylized and
decorative.

The overwhelming unity
of the show doesn’t help, either;
whatever seemed interesting in the
first painting I looked at felt clichéd
by the time I'd finally gotten to the
end. :

While I was initially struck by
the boldness of color, by the time
I'd spent twenty minutes in the
gallery, [felt bombarded, as though
I’d been aimlessly wandering
througha Fruitopia advertisement.

Byzantine chants to Turkish and
Iranian music. I was struck by how
Middle Eastern the music sounded.
The food, as always, was ex-
cellent. Common dishes such as
souvlaki (shishkabobs in pita
bread) and gyros were served, but
there was much, much more. My
favorites were the tiny cheese past-
ries known as “tiropitakia” and the
spinach and ‘cheese pastries,
“spanakopittes.” Of course there
was sweet baklava for dessert, a
delicious honey and nut pastry.
For those among you who
might be ambitious chefs, I have
included the recipe for

spanakopittes.

COOKING
WITH
RACHEL

Spanakopittes _
10 oz. frozen chopped spinach
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
3 Tbisp. olive oil
nutmeg, salt, & pepper to taste
1/4 cup fresh dill or mint
1/3 cup ricotta cheese
1/4 cup feta cheese

1 Ib. phyllo dough (available in

frozen section of Harris Teeter)
1 stick melted butter.

Defrost the frozen spinach.
Drain it, then squeeze out as much
remaining moisture as possible
with your hands. Sautee the onion
in oil until tender and golden. Add
spinach and cook over low heat,
stirring constantly, until mixture is
dry. Season to taste with nutmeg,
salt, and pepper, and scrape into a
bowl. Cool to room temperature.
Stir in the dill or mint, the ricotta,
and the feta, crumbled into small
pieces.

Defrost the frozen phyllo
dough a couple of hours before
using. Peel off two at a time,
always keeping the remaining
pieces under a damp towel. Place
the two pieces of phyllo on a flat
surface and brush with butter. Cut
into five strips the short way. Place
a tablespoon of filling about an
inch from the top of each one. Fold
acorner across the filling and keep
folding as if you were folding a
flag. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.
Makes about 50 triangles.
