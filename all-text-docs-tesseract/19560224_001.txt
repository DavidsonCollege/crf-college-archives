Teaching Careers
To Be Discussed

On Wednesday, February 29, Mr.

Master of Arts in Teaching at
Wesleyan University in Connecti-
cut, will be at Davidson to talk
with students who may be in-
terested in a career in education.

who are interested in secondary
school teaching as a career.

ler with a reception in the Ball-
room of the College Union at 10:20
a.m. The faculty will meet with
Mr. Stabler for a luncheon after

A testing schedule is worked
out with the Counseling Office.
Some tests are taken by the stu-
dent in his room and others are
taken in the office. The whole test-
ing program ordinarily runs from
eight to ten hours.

After it is completed all results
are scored and summarized on an

special remedial training may be|
given in such skills as mathemat-

worked out with the student.

A special remedial and speed
reading course, directed by Mrs.
H. T. Lilly, is now in its third year
of operation. This program has
proved generally successful with
students who wish to attain an
average reading speed as well as
with the more advanced student
who wishes to further increase his
reading speed.

Any students desiring program
scores, including freshman orien-
tation test scores, can also pick up
these at the Counseling Office.
