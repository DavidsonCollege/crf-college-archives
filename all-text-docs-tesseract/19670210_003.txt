Hess most strongly in response
te a direct question from the
editor of the Michigan Oaily
who served as moderator.

Linowitz, now ambassador in
the Organization of American
Stotes, pointed to universities.

centers which. he said, would
not be able to operate as suc-
cessfully as they now can
without the ald which Amert-
‘can business has provided.

He referred to the Inlerna:
tional = =Executive Service
Corps, an institution unfa-
miliar to neatly al) those at-

tending the discussion. which.

sends Americans to aid in the
growth of business in under-
developed enuntries.

This organization and others
nre very effective in bringing
about international economic
and trade agreements, accord-
ing tw Linowitz,

In answering nn question
nbout the U.S. economy as a
“mm and butter’ economy.
the panel agreed that the Viet-
am wat was not being pro-
longed by American business

in order te skid present

Likachman pointed awl that,
there are plenty of ways the

especially the war on poverty.

Samuelson, author of o wich:

He also pointed out that the

stated that the question of a
rising nonational debt fs “not
worth discussing.”

Hu said the debt is octiudilly

termed f a “natura) aecom-

In answer to a later question
Lekuchman tated that he

The panel agreed that this

Ashistants to hyn presidents

‘and Johnson and on the basis

Richard Goodwin. special ar-
nivtant to Kennedy snd John-
son until 1965, took issue with
the pro-adminislration posi
tions taken by Walter Rostow
and John Roche, special con
sultans to Johnson.

Goodwin charged that John-
son had changed the war from
4 Vietnamese war into an
American wat and is now tao
preoccupied with the idea of a
military victory in Vietnam to
respond properly to peace af
fers from Hanot.

‘Roche and Rostow both ar-
gued that the avar is fully eup-
ported by the South Viebtam-
eso and that the Salon gav-
ernment is aperating in a dem-
otratic manner, Bath of these
arguments wore challenced by

An a mininum though not
sufficient condition for such a
pence he said is that military
intervention across internation.
al borders to upset the status
quo must not he permitted.

This position was disputed
in a question session that fol-
lowed his speech by one edi-
tor who maintained that the
principle was being violated by
U.S. military imtervention in
Vietnam.

Efoquent despite her anfair
ness, the blonde denounced the
Lenden Rule advanced by
Frankel al the panel on “Prob-

He had said that the fault
of the Golden Rule was that

that ane should not interfere

Frankel argued that activists
should use candor ani! be hon

atntion. To ivy to du everything

ped.

The blonde, refiveting the
sentiments of most of hee wi

tion as one of unconcern, and
she expressed ahack that a
person could hold such 9 belief
in good conscience.

Secondly he sald that from
his experience until be quit

1963. he knew of no conanani-
cation of U.S. bases far a
peace settlement to North Vi-

munication, Goodwin said, the
U.S. can he “trapped into ne-
fotlations which can bé very

matter of expediency, rather
than helped out of concern, are
going ta have to direct their
efforts. more toward the eco-
nomic nnd away from the so-
gial realy in order to better
their lot.

That Was the upshat of 4
@iscunsian between two Ne:
rrocs In their 20° and a writor
for the Washington Post, The
three were George Ware. co-
otdinator of campus program
for the Student Nonviolent Co-
erdinating Committee (SN-
CC); the Rev Jesse Jackson,
director of special projects and
economic development for the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference; and Nicholas von
Hoffman, 2 reporter who is a
voteran of the Mississippi
Freedom Marches.

In the question period that
followed, Moderator David
Satter put forth the question.
“In whnt sense does Black
Powee include sovinl and eco-
fone power?” for conaibern-
tion by the panel ond abdience
of student editers,

“The classic way that power
{s exercised,” answecod Holf-
man, “is not through the tlee-
toral process, but through so-
eal preiure.” Be jcudicted

Rev. Jackson absorved that,
“The problem ja that we hnee

their power instead, to force
husinwts to allow them to enor
into competition and establish
thelr economic bane,

“The Negro community bos
the enpital but it doean't stay
there,’ Jackson told the col-
luge editars, “Tt goes off at an
angie, tather tran a circle."
He went on to my that the Ne
fro community must prowram

money hack inte its awn pock-
ats.

“We love money in the
U.S." he quippod. “We'll Fight

Until Negroes can partici-
pate in Lhe economic process
and help determine what ‘the
pattorns of consumplion and
production will be, they will
continue to be at the mercy of
auch characters os white slum
lords, Jackson said..

Ware, on the other hand, saw
Negro econamle power as “the
minimum prerequisite to Te-
move poverty in this country,”
He saw the crux of the prob-
lem ax exploitation of Negroes
and Asians inside and outside
of the Onited Stutes.

Countering Jackson and
Ware. von Hoffman said that
the big money is not in the

Several members of the aud-
fence were suspicious of the
two Negroes' emphasis on the
econamic aspects, feeling that
they were neglecting spiritual
valugs.

“tA lot of us hove said that
the entire system is wrong,"
dackson responded, “but. we
docided that ana full stomach

Ware took up the discussinn,

the gainina of Negro economic
power, must come from the

Von Hoffman agreed:
