_ARTS & LIVING _

Senior exhibitionists

By Jacop ABRAHAM
Arts & Living Editor

“~The last four of this year’s
senior exhibitions definitely dem-
onstrated that the visual arts are
alive and well at Davidson. I re-
cently talked to four of the most
promising artists of the class of
1995 about their work, their inspi-
rations, and their plans for the fu-
ture.

Texan Geoffrey McAllen
chose to focus purely on abstract
sculpture in his exhibition, The
Autonomy Series. “There’s a real
presence to sculptures, because
they exist in real space, in the same
space that. people live and move

. in,” he explained.

Claiming that his early forays
into sculpture seemed. contrived
and. coldly intellectual, he de-
scribed his experience working
with wax and bronze as areal learn-
ing process. “The first sculpture,
Dry Form, got me thinking about
the whole process. I felt like I was
doing what I wanted with the ma-
terials, not letting them havea voice
of their own.

“By the end of the process, I
was pouring the molten wax di-
rectly into water. I tried to watch
what the wax would do when it hit
the water and figure out how it was
forming those particular shapes.

My goal was te-act.as'a catalyst,:

getting the wax and bronze to speak
for itself.”

Geoff sees this approach of
letting the materials direct them-
selves, instead of imposing his own
ideas on them, as something of a
reaction to our technology-driven
society. “People use things witti-
out really knowing what they are,”
he said. “We spend all our time
twisting things around into what
we want them to be. I wanted to
explore what would happen if we
let things be what they wantto be.”

He acknowledged the work of
painter and sculptor Marcel
Duchamp as most responsible in
getting him to think about the whole
artistic process. He also cited John
Chamberlain and Peter Voulkos as
major influences, since both artists
attempt to enter into a dialogue
with interesting, unconventional
materials.

Memphis resident Kristen
McColgan explored a broader
range of mediums in her exhibi-
tion, which included oil paintings,
lithographs, and sculpture. While
the exhibition included some of
her first abstract paintings, most of
the oil paintings and lithographs
were portraits.

Portraiture has always been
one of her favorite pastimes.

It’s all “pretty much on frogs.”

“When I was little I loved drawing
people,” she explains. These days
she usually recruits her friends as
subjects or paints self-portraits. She
feels that the best portraits of the
exhibition, however, were two
untitled pieces using posed mod-
els.

Memories of childhood also
influenced her two indoor sculp-
tures, which mainly involved work-
ing with and contrasting textures.
Cephalopod, consisting of a large
steel. shell with string knotted
around the whole structure, bor-
rowed its name from an ancient sea
creature in a book she read as a

> Wchild.Theisanie book alsbvinspired
the title for Ordovician Swell and
Crumble, a worm-like sculpture
made of plastic and straw.

Herstriking outdoor sculpture,
Sisters Suggested, incorporated a
series of casts of human faces and
elbows mounted atop 16 different

:. bronze structures. The curvilinear
wire forms of the bronze gave the
pieces their height and also en-

. dowed them with a certain femi-
‘nine quality, hence the title.

Kristen mentioned that she
particularly identifies with female
sculptors, including Eva Hesse and
Louise Bourgeois. As far as por-
traits go, however, she pointed out
that John Singer Sargent is her
“all-time favorite painter” for his
ability to capture the personality of
his subjects with astounding preci-
sion.

Hailing from Richmond, Vir-
ginia, Carey Thompson also uti-
lized a wide variety of materials
and styles in herexhibition. Choos-
ing works from her entire career at
Davidson, she sought to represent
the variety that characterizes her

work. The untitled exhibition in-
cluded etchings, oil paintings,
graphite drawings, a collage, anda
lithograph. Several of the pieces
were abstract, while some were
representational. Architecture
shows up in several pieces; she
based those works on direct obser-
vation of buildings, photographs
she had taken, and imaginary build-
ings based on interesting patterns.
Carey hopes to continue to explore
some of the mediums that she used
inherexhibition, and she expressed
special interest in pursuing oil
painting.

A native of Boulder, Colo-

do, Alison Greenlee deter ,
her exhibition ‘as focusing “pretty’

much on frogs.” She seems to
have quite a fascination with the
small amphibians; various pieces
depict frog busts, frog skeletons,
frogs diving from stoves, and even
a frog in flight. She employed a
wide variety of materials in her
work, including cardboard, wood,
and pastels. Allison suggested that
anyone interested in learning more
about her exhibition drop by the
Smith Gallery of the Visual Arts
Center and see the little guys for
themselves.

After graduation, McColgan
plans to take a break from art and
study wildlife managemeat or go
to veterinary school. All the others

expressed a desire to persist with

their work. Thompson will prob-
ably hit grad school in a couple
years. Aside from continuing to
make art, McAllen said he will
spend some time getting over the
stress of the college atmosphere,
while Greenlee will hop on a VW
bus and do some traveling once
she gets her diploma.
