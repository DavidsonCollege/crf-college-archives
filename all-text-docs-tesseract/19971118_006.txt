ére are some of my con

cerns about all national so

cial clubs at Davidson, both

standing frats and possible
future sororities.

1. Exclusivity (not the often men-
tioned “elitism,” which is different): It
seems to me that the principle of exclu-
sivity is contrary to most of what we at
Davidson try to teach our students. We

teachers and workers here preach and
demonstrate and advertise and act out
in our own lives principles of reward
based on achievement, of inclusion, of
Christian love, of individual responsj-
bility, of enlightened. critical inquiry.

But the frats — and presumably
the sororities as well — teach our stu-
dents, to the contrary, that acceptance
and reward are based primarily on one’s
socioeconomic background, one’s sex, -
one’s race, one’s ability to parrot the
dominant ideology of the group; and
one’s skill at doing the bidding of one’s
peers and elders.

Above all, the group chooses the
individual, not the other way around.
This is just plain wrong.

2. Hypocrisy: As student social
structures, the fraternities, and presum-,
ably the sororities, that we leaders at
Davidson condone and support through
subsidized property on the Court,
through advertising in college publica-

tions, through recruiting materials, in-
directly through ATC student funds,
and through our institutional blessing,
are hypocritical. We say “self-selec-
tion” but watch passively as frats “bid”
and “rush” first-year men.

On the rare occasions in the past
when a student has joined a frat without
a bid, choosing to eat with frat peers
without having been invited to join an
exclusive national organization with
them, the worst sort of exclusionary
behavior has been seen. If we say self-
selection, we should enforce it rigor-
ously — with a lottery system based on
written student choices much like the
women’s houses currently operate —
and of course, independently of outside
criteria.

In addition, many, if in some cases
not all, of the “service” projects our
local chapters of these national men’s
social clubs carry out seem to many to
be only penance for their sins.

3. Traditions: Are we still beholden
to Davidson’s pre- 1970s legacy of rac-
ism and misogyny? Our frats are better
than most, some claim. :

Sure there are worse frat scenes in
American higher education, but com-
parative arguments fall flat. This is our
community, and we should form it as
we see best. The legacy of racism and
the active misogyny of the frats call for
aclean sweep, a new vision, an innova-
tive and progressive and moral.and hu-
mane plan.

Davidson has come a very long
way in the last generation. I don’t think
that the students who join KA, for in-
stance, know that their resumés carry a ,

Wy te srorly date should spar Vagt to do away

concrete stigma of racism and
antisemitism for many non-Southern
professional recruiters. Blue-blooded,
nepotistic old boys networks are passé.

If Davidson is indeed different

from many of our peer schools — and I"

think we are — then a revitalized, hu-
mane, fair, and responsible student so-
cial scene is something else that could

tee

Ultimately, we are telling our stu-

dents that two different and conflicting
sets of rules (moral laws and impera-
tives, religious and ethical traditions,
democratic and humanistic ideals) ob-

tain: one set for the moral life of the

mind and a different set for the rest of
life. This is bad pedagogy, bad ethics,
and bad mentoring. This is wrong.

“As it stands now, the practical problems of hypocrisy in
alcohol policy and self-selection as well as the hegemony
of adolescent male hedonism on the Court. Slies in the face

of what we preach here.”

set us apart. As things stand now, and
from the appearance of where things
are going, we are making ourselves
only more like other schools.

4. President Vagt’s leadership: If
there is to be any meaningful positive
change in what we, who lead this col-
lege, offer our students as a social struc-
ture, then that change has to come at
President Vagt’s initiative and has to
come in the first year or two of his
tenure here, I believe.

Otherwise, the status quo will be
blessed by inaction and nothing will
change.

As itstands now, the practical prob-
lems of hypocrisy in alcohol policy and
self-selection as well as the hegemony
of adolescent male hedonism on the
Court flies in the face of what we preach
here.

-Equity, schmequity: I don’t see
why we can’t offer the practical solu-
tion of having places for students to eat,
to socialize, to party, to organize mean-
ingful service projects, and all the rest,
without the hollow hocus-pocus of
brotherhood rituals, without imported
rules from national social clubs designed
to function at huge state universities,
without the real dangers of hazing, with-
out the insulting and destructive mi-
sogyny of the frats here.

How about all coed houses, six or
eight in all, with assignments by lottery
based on some element of student
choice?

Any newly opened real estate on
the Court could go to interest groups —
the International Student Association,
student organizations squeezed for space
until the new unionis built, dorm rooms,

with the frats.

or how about a more and better café/
bar/bistro than the Outpost?

Anchor some of the houses the-
matically, perhaps: oneis kind of sportly,
another kind of artsy, another kind of
international.

Or if that’s too radical, how about
three coed housas, three all-male, three
all-female? Let students state a prefer-
ence, then do random assignments, giv-
ing their choices some influence. Sever
all national ties; force houses to have
equal numbers of members, more or
less.

With the monies saved by elimi-
nating dues payments to national orga-
nizations, perhaps assign local dues as
seed money for Union/house or house/
house co-sponsored social events (lots
of good weekend music with good live

- bands). With a real alcohol policy,
additional money would be freed up for
other innovative social outlets.

There are certainly many other
ideas that the Davidson College com-
munity could come up with that weuld
end the hypocrisy, curb the misogyny,
decrease the endemic alcohol abuse here
and instead be creative, fair, democratic,
humane, energetic and above all — our
own: Davidson’s student social scene!

It shouldn’t be SAE’s or Duke’s or
Princeton’s or Williams College’s or
Furman’s oranybody else’s social scene,
but instead our own, and indeed Presi-
dent Vagt’s, unique scene. The gen-
erational memory here is very short.
After four years, time is eternal. Change
is possible. We must do better.

To the Editor:

When we left last spring, the
five of us didn’t think there was a
serious possibility sororities would
come to Davidson, but apparently
we were wrong.

Lately our tea-time discus-
sions here in London seem to re-
volve around the disturbing news
we hear in bits and pieces from the
Davidsonian and e-mail from
friends.

And the more we hear, the
more appealing Europe sounds as
a place to finish up our college
years.

Being across the ocean, we
feel powerless in trying to stop this
nonsense, but we are trying our
damndest by caring enough to
write. :

We've heard all the argu-
ments and won’ t rehash all of that.

Being more removed from the
details and little battles of the situ-
ation, we feel we have a clearer
view of the actual implications
sororities will have at Davidson.

It’s not that we hate sororities,
but we hate the changes they would
make to the Davidson we love and
yes, even miss.

insanity

Hundreds of images flash
through our heads as we anticipate
our return.

Will we be greeted upon our
arrival by floods of Tri-Delt clad
freshwomen?

Or what if we are mistaken
for transfers and rushed by the
eager Kappa representatives?

_ Will my roommate from last
year have exchanged her Rusk hat
for a sorority Chi-0/Davidson ver-
sion?

We'd prefer to remember our
FACs instead of anticipating rush
lemonade socials complete with
petitfours.

Whatever its imperfections,
we have confidence in the eating
house system and do not want to
jeopardize it with unneeded addi-
tions to Davidson’s social scene.

To sum it all up: Stop the
insanity.

To the Editor:

Buster Burk, the SGA presi-
dent, believes that “the opinion of
the majority matters little.” Does
this strike anyone else as a danger-
ous position for an elected official
to take?

Even if these are not the words
of Burk himself and just astatement
given by the Davidsonian editors, it
does reflect the essence of his ar-
ticle.

Maybe I am idealistic to be-
lieve that we, the student body, chose
someone to represent us, someone

we thought would listen to our con- :

cerns and do what was best for the
school.

Iam sure Burk has done this for
the most part.

After all, he created the
Vamanos Van largely in response

Note to Burk: Majority does matter

to student needs. But the minute he
disregards the opinions of the ma-
jority, he stops being our advocate.

We elected a voice, not a dicta-
tor.

Years ago, the introduction of
sororities was proposed. I have
always been told that the movement
failed because the women of
Davidson were against it.

Why were we listened to then
and not now?

The SGA poll clearly indicates

that women are still opposed to their. .

installment. Burk says sororities
will give women equal opportuni-
ties. Equal opportunities for what?
Having connections later in life?
Personally, I am insulted at the
insinuation that I cannot get a job
and make friends on my own.
Burk continues his argument
by likening sororities to Friends of

Lesbians and Gays. Sororities are
not like FLAG.

FLAG provided an organiza-
tion for a group of students who had
nothing to rally behind:

Women’s eating houses al-
ready give females this outlet. As
Dr. Ingram expressed in his article,

‘ comparisons between sororities and
FLAG and the Black Student Coa-
lition provide an excuse to disre-
gard popular opinion as well as
trivialize the truly unrepresented.

The majority of the students do
not want sororities.

Whether Burk agrees or not, he
represents us and should listen.

The majority does matter. It’s
what elected Burk.
