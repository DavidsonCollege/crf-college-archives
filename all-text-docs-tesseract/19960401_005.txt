CLASS OF 2000

Admissions accepts the “best
class ever’ one more time

By JONATHAN SIPLING
Staff Writer

As the class of 1999 winds
down its freshman year, early re-
turns are in on the potential mem-
bers of Davidson’s Class of 2000.

Despite a drop in application
rate from last year, this:pool of
acceptees is packed with talent.

To date, 1035 students have
been accepted for admission next
year, compared with 1116 accepted
students for the Class of ‘99,

This reflects the drop in appli-
cations from 3061 total to 2824
total.

However, students who have
enrolled in the Early Decision pro-
cess for the Class of 2000 number
155, down only seven from last
year. ©

The total number of students
enrolled in the Class of ‘99 totals
433.

The accepted students boast a
middle 50% range on the SAT
verbal section of 630 to 730, anda
640 to 720 range on the math sec-

tion. Their combined midrange
scores range from 1280 to 1430.

This group also comes from
the very top of their respective
high school classes. The median
class rank for women was top 2%,
top 4% for men.

Such a high class rank corre-
lates to an outstanding midrange
GPA, 3.6 to 4.2 when re-calcu-
lated by the admissions office to
reflect the rigor of the students’
high school

Students rally for new house

By BrookE BAGWELL
Staff Writer.

A gramp of Davidson students
are in the process of investigating
the option of a coed eating house—
they hope to form an organization
that will offer a unique opportu-
nity for interaction among a di-
verse group of constituents.

Freshmen Tommy Ross,
Adam Hickey, and Jordan deBree
are heading the movement to found
the new eating house. The stu-
dents feel the introduction of a
coed eating house will provide
another alternative to the Davidson
social life. Organizers hope to
form a house similar to the Union,
the Outpost, and Vail Commons.

The founders want the new house
to have both social and dining func-
tions,, ..., nse .

Tommy Ross sees a coed

house as an opportunity to develop
male and female relationships at a
deeper level. The setting would
promote such interaction, which is
difficult to achieve in single sex
dining and socializing provided by
eating houses and fraternities.

However, the founders are
quick to establish that the move for
acoed eating house is not meant as
an affront to Patterson Court.
Hickey says, “we want to stress
[that] this is in no way an anti-
Court move. We mean this as an
alternative ... this is not going to be
a self-righteous clique.”

deBree reported that after one
day of petition signing, 150 signa-

tures had. been,collected to,show,

support of the movement and ex-
press possible interest in house
membership. Faculty and admin-
istration have also given their sup-
port and encouragement in the pos-
sibility of a coed eating house.

Ross, Hickey, anddeBree plan
to host a forum to allow all who are
interested to show their support
and offer ideas. The students are
anxious to hear from those inter-
ested and hopefully arrive at a con-
sensus concerning the nature and
function of the new house. The
forum will take place on Thursday,
April 4, at 7:00 p.m. in the Big
Screen Room.

(PROFILE
Assistant Director of
Public Safety

Ray Ligouri

Students may have not have seen Ray Liguori, Davidson College’s new
Assistant Director of Public Safety: Occupational Health, Safety, and Envi-
ronmental Manager, but they have probably observed the clouds of dust he
leaves in his tracks. |

Constantly on the move, Liguori’s job includes such responsibilities as
carrying out monthly inspections of every building on campus, handling the
storage of hazardous waste generated in the science departments, conducting
monthly safety meetings with staff, and organizing Davidson’s first Campus]
Safety Committee.

Although he officially works out of the Campus Police Department,
Liguori says, “I call the campus my office.”

Liguori first came to Davidson four years ago. During those four years,
he filled a part-time position in the public safety area. Liguori took on his}
duties as Assistant Director of Public Safety last summer, he explains, when
Davidson saw the need to create a full-time position dealing with health and

safety matters.

regulations.

Of Davidson, Liguori says, “I think it’s fantastic... I’m very excited to be
here. Everybody in all the groups I’ve had contact with are great to work

“A lot of students don’t know what goes on behind the scenes in making
the campus safe,” he explains. ‘They don’t know that there is someone
overseeing a program to deal with health and safety.”

The bulk of Liguori’s job consists of building inspections. “When I go
into a building,” he says, “I look at everything, including the stairs, exit Signs,
and fire extinguishers.” Knowledgeable in public health and safety laws,
Liguori chécks the entire campus for compliance with countless governmental]

As far as classrooms and faculty work areas, Liguori says he is respon-
sible for “looking at the work environment and making sure it’s safe.” In the
chemistry and biology areas, he checks the function of ventilation hoods, an
important task due to the toxic chemicals used in the buildings, he says.

However, due to the nature of his job, he sees relatively little of the
Davidson student body. “The only time I’m getting a lot of contact with
students is while checking the fire extinguishers,” he says.

RLOdirector Kurt Holmes has
looked into the idea but says, “Tra-
dition and logistics make such a
change difficult. Belk has always
housed men since its construction
and most dorms were built to house
only one sex. . . Three fourths of
the campus is already coed. And,
the senior apartments are as coed
as you can get.”

Sigma Phi Epsilon hosted a
forum on gender relations and
Patterson Court last Tuesday. With
the help of Georgia Ringle, the
group discussed, according to
President Rix Threadgill, "how we
could improve on hook-up
themes."

A secret ballot was taken with
questions such as: "What is your
idea of an ideal pary:at Davidson?"
The results have not been tallied
yet.

However, Threadgill was not
optimistic: "I don't think anything
productive really came out of it."

Shandley, aware of the varied
solutions and their pros and cons,
says, “No clear and quick answers
existto improving genderrelations.
The self study is a start. It outlines
the problems, of which it will ulti-
mately be up to the whole campus
to try and fix.”
