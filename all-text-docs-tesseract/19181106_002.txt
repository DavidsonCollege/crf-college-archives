THE DANGER OF GOOD NEWS.

Bach day’s war news makes it seen
more aid more certain thar we will not
sce much fighting over there, that it will
all be over befure we become trained.
Bur if we are not éareful this is lable
to be a great menace. Just as German
propaganda tried its best to defeat the
Fourth Hiberty Loan drive, so will it tev
to halt the training of our armies on this
vide. “There is a danger here on the
campus that the fellows will lose interest
in their werk and give up hope of getting
into itatall, Whether-the war ends to-
morrow or-rins on fur two years longer,
everyman here should go about his train-
ing as if he expected without a doube to
he shipped to France ia the near Future.
Such a-letting up in effort is a danger
which our far seeing national leaders are
trving te prevent with concerns “Vhe
witr is not won vet, and every oman
should keep driving his hardest till it ts
won.

We hear many a iellow declaring
loudly that he is “raring” to get across
and in the trent fine trenches, with that
“fet me at Cem" spirit bristling all aver
him, Well. to be pertectly trank. he’s
a cheerful liar, as evervone knows. No
man in his right senses wants to ge into
the trenches. But this is just what con
.stitutes bravery in the war. What
would be brave in spiking a Boche on
your bavonet—or risking the epposite—
if you enjoyed the whale procceding ?
Patriotisiy and loud talk on this side are
two different things. Nine times out of
ten the silent man over here will make
the best fighter over there.

DEAN M. ORGAIN

The class of 1918 will learn with deep
sorrow of a second death in. their class,
thar of D. Mi. Ovgain. fle had been
engaged in work at Camp Lee. Va. dur-
ing the summer, and calisted in the navy
in the early part of September. He had
been in the service hardly a month when
he fell victim to nneuvonia following
Spanish influenza and succumbed ta it
after a short illness. We remember well
Orgain’s quiet, straighttorward manner :
a man of strong character, consecrated
to the ministry. The world, as well as
his class and the others of us who knew
him, has sustained a great loss in his
death. He was an all-round man and
popular with his fellows, and the sym-
pathy of his class and the whole present
student body goes out to his people in
their grief.

CIVILIANS AND RETREAT.

It has been noticed and remarked upon
several times that the civilian students
do not observe the ceremony of retreat
with due respect. ‘The other day we
noticed one ot them sauntering across
the campus and he did not pretend to
stap, much less uncover. when retreat
hegan to sound. Another day two fel-
lows cally continued playing tennis dur
ing the whole ceremony. This is due no
doubt to lack of information as to what
they are supposed to do, When retrent
begins to sound the civilian is supposed
te rise if seated (out of doors) come to

facing the flag. At the bast note of the
bugle he may resume whatever accupa-
tion he may have been pursuing, Fel
lows, the Hay: is just as much vours as it
ix the soldiers’. so why shouldn't you
honor it as much as they do? We trust
every civilian student will gladly eompls
with the demands of this patriotic cere-
tony,

The other dav someone remarked on
the fact that the students do not seem
to call on the taculty members and their
wives as they used te. Up te the pres-
ent, the tenon has been very evident.
The flu had everyone docked in till last
Sunday, when call to quarters was ob-
erved as on week nights. Sunday even-
ing is the only night ef the week when it
would be possible fir the college hoys te
pay such social calls, and na doubt. ar-

rangements can be made whereby the
evening may be free till tatten is
sounded,

“The new men evidently do not know
of this pleasant and. profitable custom
which students have observed on the
canipus for some years. Ketlows, the
members of the faculty: and their wives
are glad te have vou call on them, and
wire anxious to become acquainted with

of the campus and community life is one

the students in the faculty Komes is in
valuable te a youn man away from
hame influences. “Phe services of the
faculty and town ladies in the recent fly
epidemic cannot easily be repaid by rhe
student body. and its appreciation can
not better be chown than by such visits.
Association with such people as live ir
Davidson cannot help but be of value to
any young man,
LE. DENNARD REQUESTS
COURTESY TO THE FLAG

Lieutenant Dennard requests that.
while "To. the Colors” is being played
at. retreat, all civilians arqund the bar-
racks or on the campus pay their proper
respects to the Flag in accordance to the
national custom. Men take off their
hats and stand: ladies stand.

WEEK END PASSES ARE
MUCH SOUGHT

AFTER

“Say, Sarge, when can | get a pass?”
These words are being heard so often
that they are becoming a form of saluta-
tion, Evervhoady who fives in the vicin-
ity of Davidson or wants to go to Char-
lotte is on the rampage for a pass. The
purpose of this writing is to give some
information on this important and very
popular subject.

There will be about twenty per cent
of cach company permitted to leave the
past every Saturday for a period of ab-
sence extending from noon Saturday to
9:45 p.m. Sunday. Tt will be disere-
tionary with the company commanders
as to the method of selection,

If the men are chosen alphabetically
those who do not wish to leave will be
checked off and the full quota obtained
by going on down the list. No one will

he allowed to give his leave to another
who has already had a pass for that par
ticular round of selectians. As to an ex
change of position in. the list: there haz
been no definite statement.

‘The platoon sergeant. will decide
whether men have too many delinquen-
cies to justify their being given passes.
Moreover, by applying for a pass when
vou don't want one won't erase your
black marks for the next time when you
are so ANNiOUs to LO, ;

So take a brace, and stand or march at
attention when required, and devote a
little more time in utilizing the broom,
For you will be bhic as indigo, oF happs
