Smith seeks new assistant,

Union Director C. Shaw
Smith should announce the
appointment of a new Union
Assistant Director before the
end of this school year.

Smith will recommend
candidates for the post to
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. The position be-
comes vacant as of July 1.

Smith outlined the mea-
sures taken to secure a new
assistant director. “First,
we’ve kept our ears open for
anybody interested -- local or
otherwise,” said Smith.

“We have had some excel-
lent candidates call about the
position, many with varying
degrees of experience,’’ he
continued.

Smith said that, in addition
to talking to people who
inquire about the vacancy, an
active search for an assistant
director is being conducted.

“We have actively inter-
viewed some candidates at
conference -- the Association
of College Unions-

DR. SPENCER AND DR. JOHN-

International (A:C.U.-1.)
conference in Kansas City.

“‘There has been some
searching among alumni who
might be possibilities, whether
they are in union program-
ming or other kinds of jobs
which give a base of qualifi-
cations in filling this position,
which is one involving an
understanding and apprecia-
tion of human communi-
cation,” said Smith.

At various times in the
past, the assistant director-
ship has been filled both by
Davidson graduates and pro-
fessional union programmers.

Smith said he did not know
which type of individual would
be hired to fill the present
vacancy.

“The fact that we have used
many Davidson graduates }
the past means that there ha
been some success with it --
this is a possibility,’’ he said.
“We do see a larger program-
ming opportunity than per-
haps we have ever had and
we also see a wonderful
response on the part of stu-

dents and faculty to enlarge

recent faculty meeting.

programming.

“We're looking hard at pro-
fessionals in the field and
anybody else who’s qualified,’

’ said Smith.

Union President Karl E.
Goodhouse expressed a
definite preference for a pro-
fessional union programmer in
the assistant director’s pos-
ition.

“T strongly believe that we
must have a professional from
outside Davidson in that posi-
tion,”’ he said.

Goodhouse indicated that in
the past the lack of a strong,
centrally-located union had

not mandated a professional

Study results correlated,

show Satistied students

By
MATTHEW COVINGTON

A study of the course evalu-
ation forms circulated after
fall term this year shows that
Davidson students are satis-
fied with the way in which
they are being taught.

The returned forms have
been correlated by computer
and show that Davidson stu-
dents generally are satisfied
with their professors. The
point of dissatisfaction seems
to be that professors are slow
to return work to students.

1583 responses were re-
ceived and one third of the
courses offered fall term were
evaluated.

The questionnaire consisted
of 14 questions, each asking a
question and requesting that
the student answer by circling
one of six numbers.

This meant that the student

could rank the effectiveness of
his teacher, the work involved
in the course, and the course
itself on a one-to-six scale, one
indicating a favorable re-
sponse, six a negative.

When asked how effective
the professors were in lectures,
students generally rated their
teachers favorably. The lar-
gest number of students gave
their professors a two ona

scale where one means ‘very
effective.”
Students overwhelmingly

\rated the quality of class
discussions as ‘‘very effec-
tive.”’

Assignments ’were over-

whelmingly rated as worth-
while for class understanding.

Tests were seen as reflecting
the important aspects of the
course by most students but
responses were spread be-
tween ‘‘yes”’ and ‘‘no.”’

The largest number of stu-

dents said they spent ‘‘eight to
nine hours a week” on assign-
ments for each course. There
was a nearly perfect curve of
answers to this question, how-
ever, with as many students
spending ‘“‘zero to four hours a
week”’ as ‘14 plus’’.

Freshmen studied more
than any other class, and
seniors least.

Professors were described as

“open-minded”, ‘‘flexible’’,
“organized”’, “concerned ’’,
“enthusiastic”, ‘‘accessible’’,

‘“‘personable’’ and “‘trusting’’.
Students rated professors ev-
enly between being ‘‘challen-
ging’’ and ‘‘discouraging”’
with most responses tending
toward “‘challenging”’.

Most students were taking
the courses they responded to
in order to fulfill an area
requirement. Most students
‘strongly recommend”’ the
courses they took.

Faculty to examine student rights

By BILL BARNES
News Editor

The Trustees of Davidson College
referred the proposed Article Twelve
of the College Constitution to the
Faculty of the College for evaluation
at their February meeting.

The faculty has voted to form a
committee for the purpose of acqui-
ring a“‘representative faculty opi-

nion,’’ according to Professor of
German Hansford M. Epes, Jr.

The faculty committee is chaired by
Professor of English J. Gill Holland,
and includes Professor of Math R.
Bruce Jackson, Professor of Socio-
logy Norman B. Koller, Professor of
English Charles E. Lloyd, and Pro-
fessor of Religion Daniel D. Rhodes.

Holland indicated that he felt
privately that the document was
“unclear and some of the spirit of the
document smacks too much of adver-
sary legislation.”

“It sounds like its becoming the
students versus the rest of the

college,’’ said Holland,’’ when we
should all be going in the same
direction.’

Holland intends to rework the
document somewhat and present it to
the faculty committee as an alternate
proposal.

He added that his reworking of the
document in being undertaken on his
own and that it would definitely not
represent an effort by the full faculty
committee.

7“ lot of it is just confusing,’’ said
Holland™“1'd like to see exactly what
(others) have in mind. As it stands
it’s not too clear.’’

Holland intends to consult SGA
President Bo Baskin about the docu-
ment.

The original statement of rights
appeared as a portion of the SGA
By-laws by the Trustees of the
College, on the grounds that such an

encompassing legislation belonged in
the College Constitution.

The issue was referred to the
College Governance Committee,
which created a subcommittee made
up of three students, two faculty
members, and two members of the
adminstration.

This committee“started working
from the National Statement of
Student Rights endorsed by the
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP), the National
Students Association (NSA), and the
Association of American Colleges
(AAC),” said Epes.

The committee proposed a draft
which was rejected by the Governance
Committee in the Spring of 1975.

A new draft was reported out in
November of 1976, and this document
is the one presently under considera-
tion.

Chairman of the Governance Sub-
committee on the Statement of Rights

John W. Munce feels that the purpose
of the present faculty subcommittee is
“to save the faculty a tedious debate.

“The committee is supposed to
paste up and cut up faculty opinion
into a cohesive report that the faculty
can then vote on.”

Munce does not view that purpose
of the faculty committee as including
changing the document.

~~“*Unless they can show the sub-
committee that there are over-
whelming reasons to change, there
will be no further work on the
document,’’ he said.

‘We're going to ask for a vote on
the original document submitted to
the faculty by the governance com-
mittee. That’s what we asked for,
that’s what we’re waiting for.’’

Munce indicated that it was his
understanding that the document
would be submitted to the students
for approval by referendum at the end
of this month.
