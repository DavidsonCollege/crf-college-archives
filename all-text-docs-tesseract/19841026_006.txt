‘Committee Anticipates Drinking Age Changes

(continued from page !)

dorse the idea behind the law [pertaining
to drinking and driving] and inform the
students,” Brown said. ‘““We need to see
where the limits of the law are and what
the consequences will be,” he added.

Because the legal ramifications for
the College are unclear, the Committee
has asked a lawyer to speak at the next
meeting. ““We need to know who would
be responsible if, for example, someone
were charged [by police] at acampus eat-
ing house,” Brown said. “There are a lot
of questions about what is legal and
what’s not,” Brown added.

Brown does not forsee a recommen-
dation to the College of policing the law.
“We do think the College would do well
to support the spirit of the law,” Brown
said, “but | would be surprised if they

recommended that we [the College} be-
come agents of the police force.” He
feels that the main responsibility of the
College “‘is to get students to think about
their patterns concerning drinking and
driving,” he said.

“We don’t want students to get into

trouble [with the law] over it. We want a
solution which will make a happier envi-
ronment.”
Terry agreed that the aim of any
change in College policy would be ways
to discourage drinking and driving.
Terry said the group should consider

whether a heavy anti-alcohol program by
the College would drive parties off-cam-

pus, thus putting students on the high-

ways. Nevertheless, he feels that the
College should take a stand on the issue.
“The College can’t espouse breaking the
law,” Terry said.

Houses Formulate Alcohol, Drug Policies

Carolina drinking laws.

Neither Warner Hall nor Emanon
have formulated specific alcohol polli-
cies. According to Warner Hall president
Ross Thayer, Terry’s letter requested a
drug and/or alcohol policy, “and I took it

Disciplinary Procedure

(continued from page !)

Lean.

The current Code of Responsibility
and Code of Disciplinary Procedure was
designed in 1971. According to Terry, it
has undergone minor revisions.

Changes have included the section
which now allows the Dean to waive
holidays, weekends, and vacations in the
time permitted to investigate a complaint
of an honor violation and sign the
charges, Terry said. The time frame of
the review process was shortened by five
days, Terry added.

Another change, in which Terry said
there occurred “quite a little debate
about,” involved the suspensfon proce-
dure. The the code underwent changes so
that the offender’s suspension would in-
clude the term in which the violation oc-
curred. Terry said the two-term minimun

sanction came about at this time, since a
one-term suspension could put the vio-
lator back on campus within weeks of the
violation, if it had occurred near the end
of the term.

The two-term minimum suspension
is an agreement between himself and the
Honor Council rather than a guideline
outlined in the procedure, Terry said.

The most recent change, according to
Terry, took place in the addition of a
hearing to determine a student’s sanction
if the Honor Council returns a guilty ver-
dict.

This change came about, Terry said,
because honor hearings, which only con-
sider evidence directly related to the
charge, often overlooked mitigating cir-
cumstances that might merit a reduced
sanction.

to mean two separate policies.” Thayer
said the PCC decided to concentrate on
house drug policies now, and not require
a specific alcohol policy until later.

Emanon president Sid Jones said
Emanon has no alcohol problem which
would require a specific policy. “We
don’t see it as a problem,” he said.

The drug policies of Court houses
generally include fines to house mem-
bers for possession or use of illegal drugs
at the house or at a house function. Ema-
non imposes a $50 fine for a first offense
and expulsion from the house for a sec-
ond offense, according to Jones. Warner

Hall imposes a $75 fine for a first ot-
fense, and PAX and Sigma Alph Epsilon
have fines of $100, according to house
representatives.

Most houses have no measures for a
second offense. Thayer said Warner Hall
has no such stipulation because it has not
had much of a problem with drugs in the
past, and house members do not foresee
one in the future. According to Kappa
Alpha Order president Tony Holt, KA’s
drug policy contains no particular
punishments, but simply states that no il-
legal substances such as drugs will be al-
lowed in the house.
