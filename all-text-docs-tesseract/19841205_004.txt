Rhodes Announces Retirement After 24 Years

(continued from page 1)

Humanities, said, “I don’t know how he
did it. That was before there were two
separate chairmen in Humanities, and I
have enough to do as one of them now.”

Rhodes said Davidson students have
always been of strong character and abil-
ity despite the College’s many changes.
He believes the College is and has been
“on the right track” by promoting a lib-
eral arts education. “I hope the College
will not allow the students to profes-
sionalize too much as undergraduates.
The College should and does provide an
environment to stimulate the students’
view of the world for service to mankind.
This preparation allows them to be top
notch in their professions but not just
self-seeking.”

Everyone is obligated to raise intel-
lectual questions in all areas of study and
life, including religion, Rhodes said.

“Davidson should be a place where stu-
dents are confronted with the claims of
faith and mind,” he noted. He said he be-
lieves Davidson’s vision of the compati-
bility of faith and reason is at the heart of
what the school is all about.

Rhodes said he will continue to lec-
ture and preach and also has several ser-
mons and short stories he would like to
“get in good form” for his family. He
said he and his wife have a few travel
plans and added, “She will retire this
year, too.” Rhodes also plans to do some
traised-bed gardening and to continue
reading. He stated, “I don’t have any rad-
ical plans. I’lt be here at Davidson still.”

At a Nov. 28 dinner, Rhodes said he
felt very good about retiring and thought
the stage was set for the religion depart-
ment to move ahead. As Polley com-
mented, “The number of majors has

classes.” He said most labs meet only
once a week now, and afternoon classes
would still be possible for those people.

Laughlin said he has heard mixed
feelings about the possible change. “‘We
can’t make any recommendation without
a resolution or referendum.” He said the
SGA would “have to see how far the revi-
sions get in the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee to see if a student referendum is
appropriate.”

The Faculty Executive Committee is
considering the plan, which Terry said
would, if adopted, begin next year. Ac-
cording to Laughlin, “they may drop it or
not; we'll have to see how they act on it.”

Both Terry and Psychology Professor
and FEC member John Kelton said they
have yet to hear reaction from faculty
members.

The search began last spring when
the Trustee Athletic Committee decided
to split the positions of head football
coach and athletic director, both held by
Ed Farrell. The positions had been sepa-

tion as athletic director. After an unsuc-

cessful attempt to find a new director,
Farrell was designated as both acting ath-
letic director and head football coach.
The Trustees later named Farrell athletic
director.

In addition to Stroud, the search com-
mittee included tennis coach Jeff Frank,
Dean of Students Will Terry, and En-
glish Professor Gail Gibson.

Moved To Spring Term

By TED WILSON

The SGA will vote Tuesday on a mo-
tion to move the elections of Hobart Park
and Quips and Cranks editors from
winter term to spring term.

Yearbook editor Kathleen Micham
said the elections “should be moved, as
the next editors don’t take office until
June,” after the completion of this year's
book. She said no one signed up during
the winter last year, so she signed up
spring term.

Micham said “things are going well”
with the yearbook and the staff is work-
ing diligently to meet their first deadline
which falls during Christmas break. She
said “the sections editors are very op-
timistic” that the will be ready by De-
cember 14. She said if the staff meets all
it’s deadlines “we'll have it [the book]
out by September | .” She said the staff is
“dedicated to get it done” on schedule.
Micham said, “we've had a huge prob-
lem with photography,” but once the dif-

ficulties are resolved, the staff should be
able to meet its deadlines, the final of
which is June |.

Micham will not seek re-election as
she plans to spend her junior year in Fr-
ance.

Elections for Hobart Park editors
will probably also be moved to the
spring. Editor Jerry Lilly plans to publish
two issues of Hobart Park this year.

He said, though he has not received a
large number of entries, “what I have so
far is really good.” He said, “this week
we're organizing the reading so that over
Christmas break, a consensus can be
made at to what material is the best.” He
plans to distribute the first edition at the
end of Winter term.

Lilly attributes the smaller number of
entries to lack of advertising. He said
there was “little time for soliciting and it
was not well advertised.” He said he
hopes the issue winter edition will inspire
Students to contribute to the spring edi-
tion, which is scheduled to be distributed
at the end of the School year. “Spring is-
sues usually have more entries,” he
added.

Lilly said this year's issues will be
smaller than in the past “since our budget
is not as large as last year’s.”

grown from zero when Rhodes started
(Rhodes began the program that allowed
students to major in religion at Davidson)
to 30 some-odd now.” Polley said the de-
partment is stronger now than it has ever
been.

All the same, as Maloney said,
Davidson will miss Rhodes. “Rhodes is a
Loncolnesque figure. His judgment is al-
ways sound, and he has been like a father
to us,” he said.

Rhodes has preached and taught all
over the state. He has studied on sabbati-
cals in the Middle East through the Uni-
versity of Chicago and London. He
wrote a study book for the women of the
Presbyterian Church, and continues to

write sermons and short stories.

A native of Rocky Point, North
Carolina, received his A. B. degree at
Davidson in 1938. He taught for three
years at Glade Valley School before at-
tending Louisville Presbyterian Semi-
nary where he earned his B. D. in 1944.
At Duke University Rhodes eamed his
Ph. D. in American Religious Thought.
He was profesor of Bible and Philosophy
at Davison Elkin College from 1947-53
and at Southwestern in Memphis from
1953-60. During his time at Davison
Elkin, Rhodes was also Dean of Students
for three years. In 1960, he returned to
his alma mater as Professor of Relig’
and Philosophy.
