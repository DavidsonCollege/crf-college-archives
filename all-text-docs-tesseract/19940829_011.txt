Regional sensations Hootie & the Blowfish to perform

By Rosie Molinary

On Thursday, September 1,
the Davidson College Union will
present Atlantic Records record-
ing artists Hootie & the Blowfish.
The concert, free for all Davidson
students with a valid Davidson ID
and five dollars for the public, will
begin at9 p.m. on Richardson Field.
The Union hopes that this activity
will be a good way to welcome
new and returning students.

Hootie & the Blowfish, com-
ing off the July 5th release of their
Atlantic debut album “Cracked
Rear View,” are perhaps best
known for the song currently re-
ceiving airplay, ‘““Hold My Hand.”
This song, which the band refers to
as their “save the world” song,
features David Crosby on support-
ing vocals. The message is simple.
Lead singer Darius Rucker insists,
“It just says stop whining about

how bad things are and get up and"

do something.”

Known for his commanding
stage presence, Mark Bryan plays
lead guitar and sings backing vo-
cals. Darius Rucker, with his char-
ismatic.and soulful voice, sings
lead vocals and plays rhythm gui-
tar. Bassist Dean Felber and drum-
mer Jim “Soni” Sonefeld also chip
in on backup vocals.

Hootie and the Blowfish
Founded in 1986 while the
four band members studied at the
University of South Carolina,
Hootie and the Blowfish took their

_name: from some friends’ nick-

names. They played cover songs
of bands like R:E.M. until going
professional in 1989 and begin-
ning to record independent re-
leases.

Their latest release, produced
in Los Angeles by Don Gehman
(R.E.M., John Mellancamp, Bruce

Hornsby), features 11 original folk
rock pieces that.blend 60’s rock,
blues, country, bluegrass and R &
B.

The band has succeeded be-
cause of its incredible gift for in-
trospection and sincerity in exam-
ining the past or complex issues
and emotions.: Their music is per-

sonal— exploring relationships,

negative behavior, deaths of loved
ones, or social issues. They are
also fun, combining dynamic per-

Young continued from page 10 |

the aggressively sinister “Change
Your Mind,” a hypnotic diatribe
on the delusions of love. “Protect-
ing you from this/ Must be the one
you love/ Must be the one whose
magic touch can change your
mind,” Young tosses out sarcasti-
cally. With its stern, forceful gui-
tar work and eery chorus, this song
is a classic.

There are a couple of songs on
the album that I don’t really enjoy.

“Western Hero” seems to me an
overly sentimentalized ballad remi-
niscent of “Unknown Legend” off
of Harvest Moon, while “Blue
Eden” is filled. with too much dis-
tortion for my tastes.

Oddly enough, despite the
presence of a few slightly hopeful
songs, the overall mood of this
album is a dark one. Most of the
songs are played in a minor key,
which lends itself to an often fore-
boding tone. Crazy Horse is in top
form, and the arrangements are

The trip began with somerain,
but in many ways this brought the
crews closer together. Jenn Schuetz
and Rob Clemens found that this
was actually one of the most fun
and rewarding parts of the trip. As
12 people huddled under a tarp to

cook dinner and sing songs, Jenn:

-and Rob actually found the rain a
welcome surprise. Although there
were some adversities—blisters,
sweat, rain—Ed Daugherty assures
that it is nothing close t o an Out-
ward Bound experience. There are
many treats and surprises along
the way. In the middle of a hard
day’s hike a group might encoun-
tera Ben and Jerry’ s delivery from
a logistics crew, or their trip leader
might pull out a pack of Snickers
bars at some unexpected time.

parodies of their trips and skits on
the last night of Odyssey. Evéry-
thing from fashion shows to rap

Dear Terry,

My roommate is getting mar-
ried next month, and I can’t stop
feeling lonely because I haven’t
yet found “Mr. Right.” I’m start-
ing to antagonize my roommate
without meaning to because I’m
jealous that she’s so settled in her
life. How can I stop?
Sincerely, °
Miss Wrong

Dear Miss Wrong,

Ihad the same situation when
I was young and starting out on
my own. I was getting married
and my roommate did everything
she could to make my life diffi-
-cult as I got ready for the wed-
ding. There’s a special corner of
hell for people like you. Quit
being so selfish and hélp your

biggest day of her life.

Send her your positive en-
ergy’ when you’re around her,
and keep your loneliness locked
up and festering inside of you.
For the next month, her feelings,
not yours, should be the priority.
Remember, there’s a reason men
are attracted to her and not you.
And always keep smiling!

Love, Terry
