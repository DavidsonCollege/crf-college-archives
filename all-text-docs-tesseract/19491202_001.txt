After having examined the G
man high school, its system and
present problems, at least to some
extent, let us now continue to fol-
low the process of education and
take a look at the
German Universi-
ty.

The institution
in Germany, simi-
lar to the Ameri-
can postgraduate
Meschool, is the
: Unversity. Its
Pe ‘ig history and tradi-

Md y fhe are very old
and go back to 1348 when the Ger-
man emperor Karl IV founded the
first university in Prague (which is
now the capitol of Czeckostovakia,
but was then a German city.) A
short time later, also in the 14th
century, the University at Heidel-
burg, Erfurt and in Koeln were
founded, Today. there are thirty
universities in Germany, 20 per cent
of which are in the Russian occu-
pied zone.
" Whenever describing one insti-
tution or an organization, one way
to do it is to take one out of many
which may be typical of the rest.
l.et us take the one out of many
which is very typical. The Univer-
sitv of Heidelburg is one of the best
known German universities. _

Heidelberg is an ideal town for a
university. It is situated at the end
of the lovely Neckar fiver, leaves
the mountains and enters into the
plain country, its waters: gliding
smoothly and glittering in the sun
like a silver ribbon.

Modern buildings and little, old
fashioned panei board houses dec-
orated with woodcarved emblazon-
ments of famous noblemen extend
along both sides of the river close-
ly crowded at the foot of the moun-
tains, several old stone bridges con-
nect the two parts of the town.

On the left side, at a height of
about two hundred feet, overlook-
‘ing the town and the valicy, and
shadowed only by great elm trees,
there are the ruins of the old castle
ot Heidelberg, beautiful sandstone
buildings, that will glow in the red
of a setting sun.

And near the center of the town,
wHose two towers rise high into
the sky, and whose deep toned bells
are famous all over Germany, there
are the buildings of the university
—old and wooden buildings, which
seem to push aside all the small
houses surrounding them.

lt may seem unnecessary to you
10 give a description so detailed of
the place where the university is lo-
cated, but what I am trying to do
is to give you an idea or word pic-
ture of a German University town.

There is a certain atmosphere,
which is charactertistic of these
smaller German towns and which
is to be found only in Germany—
nawhere else in the world, This at-
wosphere is perhaps best described
as romantic — lined with old trae
dition and old fashions, a place for-
gotten by the tempo of our world
of today, remaining in the peace of
the centuries which have passed
by its doors.

And this atmosphere has a great

Pinkney Stands dn
Burning Deck As,
Fire Truck Stalls

Several days before the Thanks-
giving holidays fire broke out at
the home of Professor Jim Pink-
ney.

The blaze was caused by leaves
which had collected in a chimney,
but there was no damage to house
or any of: its furnishings, it has
been learned from Prof, Pinkney.

Mrs. Pinkney discovered the fire,
and it was reported to the local
fire department. Although the town
fire truck attempted to answer the
call, it could not be pushed to the
scene of the conflagration in time
to be of use, A dead battery is said
to have been the cause of the delay.

At the time the fire occurred,
Prof. Pinkney was meeting one of
his classes, which was interrupted
for the occasion.

Earl F. Berg, Eunice P. Berg, Harold Frantz, and Elizabeth

Frantz gave a joint recital of two husband-and-wife

teams

Wednesday night, November 30, at 8:15 P. M. Both Mr. Berg
and Mr. Frantz are on the Davidson faculty, Mr. Berg having
come here in 1941 and Mr. Frantz being new here this ye year. Mr.

Berg sang baritone, accompanied
by his wife at the piano, and Mes.
Frantz played violin, with Mr.
Frantz accompanying on the or-
gan. Mr, and Mrs. Berg have been
giving recitals together since their
college «lays in Morehead, Minne-
sota, and Mr. and Mrs. Frantz have
also been playing together for sev-
eral years, The violin and organ
arrangement is unusual; Mr. Frantz
adapts the accompaniments for or-
gan himself. :

The first of the five portions of
the program consisted of two arias
sung by Mr. Berg: Schlummert ein,
ihr matten Augen, from the Can-
tata “Ich habe genug.” and Ja, ja,
ich kann die Feinde schlagen froin
the Cantata."Selig ist der Mann”;
both arias by Bach.

The second section was the
Sonata in D major of Handel, con-
sisting of four movements: Adagio,
Allegro, Larghetto, Allegro, Mrs.
Frantz played this selection,

The third portion of the program
was five songs by Hugo Wolf, sung
by Mr. Berg: “Gesang Weyla’s;”
“Nun wandre, Maria;” “Der Tam-
bour;” “Anareon’s Grab; and “Das
Staendchen.”

The fourth part of the program
consisted of Christian Sindling’s
“Suite in A minor,” comprising
three movements: Presto, Adagio,
Tempo giusto,

The fifth section was another
five songs by Mr, Berg. The first
“Elegy,”’ and the second, “All Day
I Hear," are’ both by Elizabeth
Clark Speer. Bela Bartok wrote the
third, “Tears of Autumn: Samuel
Barber is the composer of “Rain
Has Fallen.” the yourth selection:
and “The Lover's Maze’ was writ-
ten. by Peter Warlock.

byterian Church in Jacksonville,
Professor Beaty at South Jackson-
ville, Mr. Arnold at the First Pres-

Sig Up Hears Essay
And Short Stories

The members of the Siema Up-
silon Literary Fraternity held their
post-Thanksgiving meeting on
Monday night, November 28. Hav-
ing gathered at the Sigma = Chi
house, they were ready to erin
the meeting at 9:15. The me Sting
was presided over by the vice-pres-
ident, Chartes Davis. As is the us-
ual custom three papers were read,
one being an essay, and the other
two short. stories, These papers
were both read and written by the
members of the organization them-
selves, The first short story, “The
Yellow Envelope,” by Bill Cum-
mings was a discussion of the re-
sults of family domination on a
college freshman, and the inevitable
end to which it leads. George
Adams read his “Tobacco,” which
tell of the ways in which man is
affected by this plant. “Behold,
how the fate of nations is swayed
by the golden weed,” is a quotation
from this essay which brings out
his main point. The last event of
the evening was another short
story. This was the story of aman
of the Kentucky mountains whose
main taste and desire was for booze,
and how this affected him, This
interesting climax to the evening
was provided by John Hobart.

Queens Girls Plan
Yule Season Dance

Queens College is holding its an-
nual Christmas dance in the form
of “A Crystal Ball,” Saturday eve-
ning, December 3, at 8 p. m. on the
campus. This dance is one of two
school dances of the year, sponsor-
ed by the Social Committee of the
collece.

Since Queens’ balls are frequent-
ed by many Davidson students who
will be on hand at the occasion, this
dance will be of particular inter-
est. Billy Knauté and his orchestra
are to play for the festivity which
will be a card dance, a tradition of
the collegé. The five sororities on
the campus usually hold a party in
their houses or a formal banquet in
downtown Charlotte before | the

Army Cheer Leaders Southern Novelist To
Our Herod Herod’’ Speak at Phi Meeting

Every year when Army and Na-
vy get together for their annual
struggle on the gridiron, the mid-
shipmen and cadets try to out-in-
sult each other. Poor old Navy was
slightly backfired upon this year,
but here's the whole story.

When the cadets came out on
the field in Philadelphia, prepara-
tory to mopping it up rather well
with the bluejackets, they were
greeted by the midshipmen in the
stands with a new version of “An,
Brave Old Army Team.” The
words;

“We don't play Notre Dame;

We Don't play Tulane;

We just play Davidson,

For that’s the fearless Army
way!"

The middies were pretty cocky
after that, so, when they had all
taken their seats, a banner was dis-
played, reading: “After Davidson—
Smith??" The cadets at this point
had nothing to say. When the ban-
ner “When do you drop Navy? was
held up, however, they were all
ready: “Today,” read the card that
popped up in the army stands. The
rest is history. However, there is
one small “P, S.” to be added; tow-

ards the end of the game several,

signs appeared in the Army cheer-
ing section that far outdid any of
Navy’s best efforts at insult. They
said simply: “Davidson = scored,
didn’t they?” .

Mrs. Sims is a resident of Char-
lotte and a native of Dalton, Geor-
gia. Since 1934 seven novels have

“The City on the Hill,” and “Storm
Before Daybreak.”

West Entertains ‘The Uninvited’ Turns
Out to Be "The Horse Who Came to Dinner’

If you are a Davidson student
and a normal individual (which in
all probality is only a possibility),
you by odds of | to 5.54 live in
West Dormitory and likewise by
odds of 1 to 860 were in same
Saturday night, November 12. If
this be so, perchance this recount
will rejuvenate the corples of your
math 11—smitten heart.

About 11:00 P. M. on the afore-
mentioned day when most good
Davidsonites were in Charlotte, and
the rest of us were trying to re-
cuperate from Friday night, a syl-
phlike pitter-patter of hoof-beats
on the floor above brought remini-
scenses of perhaps Charlie Mitchell
on the Barium Springs stage, an
amateur rendition of “Mule-Train,”
or the St. Nick octet on Weihnach-
ten Eve (that’s the night before
Christmas to you German stu-
dents.)

However, it turned -out to be
none of these. When I heard same.
I bounded the 16 odd steps-rote-
and turned the corner as I reached
the first floor:

“And what to my unspectacled
eye should appear, but a centaur-
like twosome, one front and one

rear,” ;

Hastily affixing my Ballard and
Ballard postpaid. ready-ground-be-
fore-your-eyes horn rims, I noted
that the one afore was one “Horse”
Gene Regen, while arrears was
just one horse. (As to which one
may lay claim to said title of
“horse,” T leave open to discussion
and interpretation.)

Nevertheless, as the story goes,
it seems as though this poor four-
legged Equus Callabus had been
found that evening and to the dis-
may of th: bronco — to coin a
trite pun -- the boys had just
been passing the “buck” (gelding,
what have you). My report takes
original ownership back to Leroy
Mimms, From thence this “grasi-
stallion” passed into the hands of
the heavyweight category cf afore-
mentioned Gene Regen. Regen, not
getting this walking business too

'well, decided to ride the charger,

and accompanied by fellow-horse-
men, Linton Deck and Andy
Horne, with numerous other hear-
says, the group reined this Breceph-
alus into several ground-level dor-
mitory halls. Finding it almost im-
possible to move astern, this

“head’’-strong steed several times
forced his way into the gentlemen’s
restroom, rooms and halls in order
to make the correct U-turn (as re-
quired by North Carolina law) in
order to get out of the dorms. .
Later, upon the suggestion of
many Abernathy-lecture-conscious
Lone Rangers Bob Hollister again
was to be the scapegoat by means
of this he-horse. It seems the as-
semblage, with horse (masculine
and nenter-plural) gained access to
the basement floor of West by the
back door and left this hay-burner
to figure the Editor's room out for
himself. You can imagine the cha-
grin and embarrassment of the nag
when he found himself confronted,
not with a stall full of oats and al-
falfa, but a room knee-deep in
Davidsonian clippings, Abernathy’s
lecture embossed on steel, negatives
of “Fifi” and free passes to the
I:nperial Theatre. Well there’s no
telling what transpired during this

‘period of isolation, but everyone

had good reason to believe this in-
quisitive Equus pretty much ab-
sorbed the Mounder’s room and
vice-versa. As the old saying goes,

CONCERT HERE MONDAY NIGHT

The second program on the Davidson College Artist Series, a
concert by Jacob Lateiner, young Cuban pianist, will be given

eoncert will be the young musician's second appearance at
Davidson. He played an earlier engagement here in 1948 and

om Loves Mary
To Go On The ae

The Red and ‘Black Masquers
take their play,

quers production.

The announcement came after
a long meeting with the Executive
Committee of the college by sever-
al members of the Masquers Wed-
nesday afternoon and after Director
Gay had agreed to revise certain
parts of the play.

The main faculty opposition is
believed to have centered around
scenes involving drinking, swear-
ing, and one in which John appears
sans trousers on the stage. It is
believed that these parts of the
play make it undesirable in that the
presentation of it by a college or-
ganization would not be in keeping
with the Davidson standards. These
parts will be revised.

With these revisions the Mas-
quers will present the play Friday
night, before the Winthrop College
audience in Rock Hill, S. C. It will
be sponsored by the Winthrop Dra-
matics organization and = curtain
time will be 8 o'clock.

“John Loves Mary” was present-
ed twice before the Davidson Col-
lege audience on last November 21,
and 22 without any faculty opposi-
tion,

The Masquers are undecided as
yet as to whether or not the play
will be carried to any other out-
side audiences.

an automobile accident, the visi-
tors were able to score 25 points.

sle by compiling 67 points. Mem-
bers of the deputation, all of whom
played on the team, are Bill Brown-
