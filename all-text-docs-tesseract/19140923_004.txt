FOOT BALL RIVALS.

revived. and the entire student body to
back Ferzer's team, it will be a game
well worth sceing.

Wake Forest has few oid men back.
bur an abundance of new material.

Furman. Newberry? and Wofford’s
prospects are very promising.

THE TEAM.

Since. last issue the Fuot Ball Squad
has been increased to four full teams,
and the coaches are getting the men in
better shape every day. New men are
being sent to the training table at Booes
every dav. Charlie, the liniment “Oste-
opether.” is kept busy rubbing cbruised
spots, regular foot ball meetings are held
after supper, blackboard work showing
new plavs, mastering of the rules, new
signals, hitting the dummy, bucking the
sledge. regular scrimmaging. etc.. Lis get-
ting the Squad in excellent tritn.

Tim Pharr will be greatly inissed;
with his usual fighe and spirit. [f Pit
makes as good a preacher as foot hall
player. he will be a power. Captain
Howell has been on side line with a bad
ankle for several days, and one or two
others have had minor injuries. “Shim”
Gloover is losing severat pounds of
avirdupois each afternoon.

Dr. C. M. Lentz, an alumni of Gold-
hill, was on the “Hill” Monday, and is
back now to help with getting the Foot
Ball Squad. He is familiarly known as
“Luby.” and also as one of the best
guards and centers that has ever been]
here. He was on the team when the
“Old Davidson Spirit and Pep" was at
its height. We are glad to have him
back for a few days, and hope that many
other alumni will also come to help.

Dr. Hamilton W. McKay, an alumni
who has always been loyal and interested
in Davidson’ s athletics, has been “on the
Hill” frequently this Fall. He was one
of the best, if not the best. full back that
“the Red and Black Machine” has ever
had. He is on the Executive Committee
of the Alumni Athletic Association, and
to him much of the success of the move-
ment is'due. He has been out in ‘uni-
form cach time he came up, and his in-
tentions are to come up each week dur-
ing the season and ,

OUR’ GOLF-CLUR. |

Most of the golfers were away for
the stinmer and there was not much
“doing” dewn on the Golf Course.
Much work was. done in widening the
Fairway of No. t and the Fairway for
No. 4. Two of the hazards have been
greatly improved and one trap remodel-
ed. This will add greatly to the effi-
ciency of the course.

At the first meeting of the club bast

week steps were taken to get the course
ready for play by September 21, and the’
student membership fee was made $5.00.
The club wants a strong and enthusiastic
student membership. New members can
secure their membership cards from Dr.
J. M. McConnell, ‘Treasurer.

The club is encouraged to have among
the new students one who comes bearing
the laurels of one of the best courses in
the State. Mr. Woodrow Clark won
the open championship at Greensboro.
We welcome him to our course and will
back him to win honors for Davidson.

This year the club will have many
interesting social features. The first so-
cial evening will be given at the home of
Dr. and Mrs. Arbuckle next Tuesdav
at 8 p.m. The student members will

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN. September 23, 1914

DAVIDSON COLLEGF.

————

‘lo the Student Body of “Old D. C.”

Dear Friends: Knowing that we are
to play a game with Clemson on our
home grounds in a very short time, and
being very much interested in the re-
sult, 1 am going to tell you just a little
of what [ saw at the game at Clemson
last fall when the score was in favor of
the Tigers.

‘The game really opened with a mighty
whoop of about 650 men at the top of
the hill who then came pouring, as i
from the skies, down to the side lines.
It was only a short time until the game
began between Davidson’s Varsity and
Clemson’s Varsity—the ball was see-
sawed up and down the field until out of
Clemson’s territory, then Clemson’s sec-
ond team was put in, and soon as they
began loosing ground and wind, the Var-
sity, who had had time to catch. their
breath, were put back to stop the Red
and Black Machine. That last sentence
tells just why Davidson was defeated at
Clemson last fail. It was not because
Clemson had the stronger team, but be-
‘Tl eatise Davidson had come to Clemson
with one team, while Clemson was at
home and worked three different teams
against our one.

For my part, I can not see the justice},

of plaving 33 men again 11, but if it is
just, I trust that Davidson will have the

necessary, 33 men in uniform the dav of

the game and win the game Davidson
deserved to win last fall. Clemson did
not win on superior foot ball tactics, but
simply overpowered our boys by force of
numbers. Ask. Coach Fetzer if 1 am

jright; he was referee at this game.

Now about the ‘Davidson Spirit !”
When the game begins let every man in
college be present and do his full part
in encouraging the team. Let the Clem-
son team know just what the ‘“David-
son Spirit’ means. Make all the fuss
vou.can, but fellows. when our quarter-
hack is calling signals Iet all vells stop;
if our team can not hear the signals
how will they know what to do?

| hope to see a full account of the
game in ‘Tire Davinsonian, and 1 hope
to read that Davidson won on account
of the best team and the best college
spirit. Faithfully yours,

E.G. Marcarp, Jr. (09)
