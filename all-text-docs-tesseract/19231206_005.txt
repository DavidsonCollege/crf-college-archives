Details of the plat were left to the board- |

The boarding houses pursued different
courses. Shumaker’s did not serve breakfast
and that part of the money paid by the stu-
dents which would have gone to pay for one
breakfast was given to the relief fund.
Thompson's did not serve a desert for din-
ner. Some served soup only and others fol-
lowed still other plans.

But the spirit was the same. It meant that
the student were giving their food for those
of God's people who are starving.

PROFESSOR CURRIE STRESSES
POWER OF GOD’S SPIRIT

The Students’ Sunday School class was
led last Sunday by Prof. Archibald Cur-
rie. Though the attendance was small,
the class had an interesting and inspir-
ing meeting. The subject of the discus-

sion was “The Outreach of the Early
Church.”

ANTOINE LAURENT LAVOISIER
1743-1794
Born in Paris, son of a wealthy
tradesman, As a student won
a prize for an essay on lighting
the streets of Paris. Held vari-
ous Government posts. A mar-
tyr of the Reign of Terror.
Founder of modern chemistry.

This is the mark of the
General Electric Com-
pany, an organization
of 100,000 men and
women engagedinpro- .
ducing the tools by
which electricity —
man’s great servant—
is making the world a
better place to live in,

They couldn’t destroy
the work he did

“The Republic has no need for savants,”
sneered a tool of Robespierre as he sent
Lavoisier, founder of modern chemistry, to
the guillotine. A century later the French
Government collected all the scientific
studies of this great citizen of Paris and
published them, that the record of his re-
searches might be preserved for all time.

Lavoisier showed the errors of the theory
of phlogiston—that hypothetical, material
substance which was believed to be an ele-
ment of all combustible compounds and tod
produce fire when liberated. He proved
fire to be the union of other elements with
a gas which he named oxygen.

Lavoisier’s work goes on. In the Research
Laboratories of the General Electric Com-
pany the determination of the effects of
atmospheric aironlamp filaments, on metals
and on delicate instruments is possible be-
cause of the discoveries of Lavoisier and

his contemporaries.
