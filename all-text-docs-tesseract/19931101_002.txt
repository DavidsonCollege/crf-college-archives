Bar Wars

Local restaraunts, Back Street Cafe, Davino's,
and Holiday Inn's Signatures,
compete for students' week-night business.

By Ashlyn Dannelly

Davidson student business is
proving to be a hot commodity.

Several local businesses are
working hard to attract large
crowds to their prospective estab-
lishments. Davino’s, Back Street
Cafe, and Signatures compete for
the low budget, college weeknight
crowd.

Within walking distance from
campus, Davino’s Restaurant and
Bar draws large numbers of
Davidson students with its
Wednesday night specials. Owner
Steve Tonaus offers all you can eat
pizza for $4.50 and beer at 75 cents
a mug.

According to Tonaus, “nor-
mally, they’re packed in here all
night long.” Davino’s seats at least
106 people, and Tonaus estimates
that on an average Wednesday
night, there have been from 100 to
150 students attending.

Such strong competition ap-
pears to be affecting an old
Davidson favorite, Back Street
Cafe. In the past, Back Street was
a popular Thursday night hangout
for many Wildcats.

But, according to co-owner
Kathie Bryant, this year’s Thurs-
day night crowds have “dropped

off tremendously. We’re talking |}

pital” wristbands to all 21 year
olds. However, Bryantstresses that

under 21 year olds “are still wel- -[f
come,” and the restaurant still of-
fers its Thursday night drink spe-.

cials.

The new banding policy re-
sults from a personal decision made
within the business. Bryant says
Back Street plans to kick off the
new policy with a big band party
sometime soon. She adds: “We’re
happy with our business, but we
would like to get Thursday night
back to Davidson night.”

Entering the fray for Davidson
business is newcomer Signatures,
in the Cornelius Holiday Inn.

Owner Andrew Kaltsas hopes
to attract Davidsonians with a
shuttle running from the college to

College students are known to frequent Back Street Cafe on Thursdays: Davino's and Seiad

his club for the Tuesday night col-
lege nights.

Kaltsas guarantees the “best
prices in town,” which include a50
cent draft beer. A live DJ and dance
floor serve as additional attrac-
tions for Signatures. Kaltsas ad-
mits he has not yet had a high
Tuesday night turnout, but with
increased advertising, he expects
that number to grow.

So, as these three businesses

try to lure Davidson students with
separate Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday night college nights,
which do the students prefer?

_ Junior Ashley Atkins. says,
“the most important thing is if a lot
of people are going to be there
hanging out, and I wouldn’t com-
plain if they had cheap beer.” She
adds, "As it stands, Ilike Davino’s
atmosphere.”

That seems to be a popular

choice among all Davidson stu-
dents, as Davino’s college night is
currently the most Populae among
the three.

fine: "I try to gear my business
toward students. I know they’re on
budgets, so I try to help them out.
I really appreciate their business,
and we’re getting more student
business other times during the
week."

SGA continues to address college's exclusive policies

potential situation of a non-Chris-
tian running for Alumniboard trust-

ees. Jim Fuller '65, a civil rights
attorney in Raleigh "proposed that
the Board strike its Christian re-
quirement for Alumni trustees,"
says Brian Tarr, Director of Alumni
Relations.

Tarr mentioned that because
the president and president-elect
are ex-Officio trustees, they also
cannot be on the trustee board.

The proposal was to be voted
on in the fall meeting of the Alumni
board but the lack of support indi-
cated that no vote was necessary.

According to Tarr, there were
two other possible routes: to adopt
the proposal and face the possibil-
ity of electing Alumni trustees who
could then not sit on the board due
to the trustee's requirement. Or, to
direct alumni leaders to ask the
trustees to make an exception for
the alumni trustees.

There was not enough support
for either of these options though
he mentioned that senior president
Jennifer Humphrey, the only stu-
dent sitting on the Alumni board,
spoke supporting Fuller's proposal.
Tarr says, "The basic issue is what
it means to be a Christian college."

“As the alumni becomes more
and more diverse, this becomes a
practical inclusivity problem,” says

Sherburne Laughlin, amember of —

the alumni board and president of
the board when the issue was raised.
Comments from a Trustee

This issue has not come to the
Trustees according to Larry
Dagenhart, a Charlotte attorney and
secretary of the Board of Trustees.
He listed three possible arguments
addressing the clause requiring
church membership.

One school of thought might
say: Do not change it. “We’re
watering..down...Christianity
enough. We’ve already done it
with the faculty. We don’t wantto
be a Amherst or Williams--com-
pletely secular.”

Another perspective, says
Dagenhart, might assert: “Be in-
clusive. We’re missing good trust-
ees this way. You shouldn’t have
to have this rule to preserve our
Christian heritage.”

The last viewpoint which
‘Dagenhart enumerated involves a
compromise: Leave the require-
ment for the church approved po-
sitions, but eliminate the clause for
at-large and alumni members.

The Resolution

The resolution reads:
“Whereas, the Davidson Trustee
Bylaws state, ‘All persons elected

as Trustees shall be active mem-

bers of a Christian Church’;
“Whereas, This statement ex-

cludes valuable members of the
Davidson community who wish to
become Davidson Trustees;

“Whereas, This statement con-
tradicts Davidson’s commitment
to “recognizing and appreciating
non-Christian traditions,” as stated
in Article VII. B. 14 of the Strate-
gic Planning document;

“Whereas, This statement pro-
hibits the composition of the trust-
ees from reflecting the diversity of
the student body, the alumni, or the
faculty;

“And whereas it is the consen-
sus of ‘the Student Government
Association that the elimination of
this statement would affirm
Davidson’s Christian heritage
rather than threaten it;

The agenda for next week’s
Student Government Association
meeting includes a proposal for a
cigarette machine oncampus. Stu-
dents have been unable to buy
cigarettes on campus since the
Union stopped selling them a few
years ago.

Most of the people asked
about this issue see no problem
with having cigarettes sold on
campus. Thad Reece, an avid
non-smoker, thinks a cigarette
machine is a good idea “as a
money making endeavor.” He
wishes the union would sell ciga-
rettes and use those profits to
“lower the outrageous prices on
everything else.”

Smoker Bill Gullan thinks
that this will keep people on cam-
pus after they have been drinking,

which is a dangerous situation.

SGA goes for the smoker vote

He says, “Smokers need to be de-
stigmatized; it’s a habit, not a per-
sonality flaw.”

Students feel they should be
able to make the choice for them-
selves and the main effect of not
having cigarettes is the inconve-
nience of going to places like
Holiday Inn at four o’clock in the
morning for a cigarette. The
money from the sale of cigarettes
should be able tomake money for
the school. To many, it does not
make any sense to let other places
make a profit offall of thecollege’s
smokers. The profits could go to
an area of the campus that needs
funding.

The SGA will be meeting next
week; if anyone has a strong feel-

ing one way or the other, they are}

invited to attend.
Jay Jennings

“Let it be resolved that on this

day, October 26, 1993, the Student
Government Association encour-

ages the Davidson trustees to elimi-
nate Article 1, 4 of the Trustee
Bylaws, ‘All persons elected as

' Trustees shall be active members

of a Christian church.”
Controversy and Discussion

When Smith firstread the reso-
lution and asked for discussion,
the Senate remained silent. But
once a few comments were made,
a long debate followed addressing
the concerns of both proponents
and opponents to the idea.

Alice Spivey, SGA Vice Presi-
dent, expressed her apprehension
about removing Christianity from
the document. “I’m afraid we’re

embarrassed of Davidson’s tradi-
tion,” she said.

“But this is not the Davidson
of 1837,” replied Rafael
Candelario, BSC Senator, “If it
was, I would not be here, nor would
any of the women on this senate.”

Some senators suggested
changing the wording. Anne
Bartholomew suggested “respect
of Christian ideals.” Bo
Bartholomew, Sophomore Presi-
dent, suggested trustees “uphold
honor, integrity, and moral val-
ues.”

Others thought changing the
wording would not convey the
strongest statement possible. Smith
reminded the senate that the reso-
lution was only encouragement.
