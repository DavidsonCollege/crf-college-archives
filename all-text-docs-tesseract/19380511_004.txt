What kind of a football team will Davidson College have this fall?
I have been asked that question time and time again—probably you
have asked me yourself, and probably you think you have the cor-
rect answer. If you happen to be one of those that think Davidson
College will be beaten by State, mauled by Duke, trampled by Caro-
lina, whipped by Furman, flogged by the South Carolina Gamecocks

—then you are just the person that I want to read this column

Put your whole heart and mind into the game. When youngeam

fumbles let it hurt you as much as it must have hurt the player who

fumbled. When the other team fumbles, be just as eager to recover

it as the players. “Hold that line” with every ounce of energy

that you possess. Bat down every pass that the opponents throw

throughout the game you will find that you have not only put your
heart and mind into the game, but also your body. You will be tired

but happy and satisfied witha game well played

Don't say as I have heard many say—‘Ah, well!

do you think you are giving the team your solid support? You may be
present at the game, but something will be lacking, and that something

may cause your team to lose.

If the entire Davidson student body had enough confidence in their

I hate to lose and I only hope that 650 Davidson students hate to lose
as much as I do. My parting words to you are these: “Let's fight them

slump last week, Rudisill played a large part in the Wake Forest
victory by driving in three runs at a crucial moment. Hemphill has
played consistently good ball‘on the keystone sack all season, his
fielding being a feature of the Wildcat infield. _Both men are juniors
