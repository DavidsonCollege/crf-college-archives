Large fee increases hit private and public college students

(CPS)—‘“‘No way, we won't
pay,’ chanted upwards of 900
Tufts University students at a
rally held last’ month to protest
a tuition increase of $904. At
Wright State University in
Ohio, the catchword is HALT -
Higher Ambitions, Lower Tui-
tion. There, a $80-90 increase in
tuition is expected for fall
quarter. Students already or-
ganized a letter-writing cam-
paign.

Protests such as these are
sprouting on many campuses in
face of tuition increases that
promise to surpass last year’s.
Then, the average tab, tuition,
room and board cumulatively,
jumped five to eight percent for
most schools, outpacing for
many the increase in the Con-
sumer Price Index and the
Higher Education Price Index
(the prices schools pay for
goods). Next fall’s forecast is
even more dismal.

Preliminary reports show in-
creases ranging from eight to
eleven percent over this year’s
level. for example: ..

The 500,000 students at the
82 State Universities of New,,
York (SUNY) and City Univer:

sities of New York (CUNY) are =

expecting a $100 tuition in-
crease which would raise the
current charges by 10.6 percent.
Now, freshmen and sophomores
pay $750 per year, and juniors
and seniors pay $900.

In. Massachusetts, the legis-
lature’s Education Committee

is considering a proposal that |

would raise the share of the
student’s cost of education to 25
percent in 1979,.and 30 percent
in 1981. At U-Mass, this would
mean the 1978-80 tuition of
$525 would be raised to $859
next fall, and $1034 in 1981.
The protest at Tufts prompt-

ed the administration to lower -

the prop ‘sed tuition hike from
$904 a year (a 12.8 percent
increase) to $590 and then to
$550. Together with room and
board, there would still be a
10. Tpercent increase of $754.

The Oregon legislature is

recommending a 16 percent hike «

for next fall for state schools.
It’s also considering reinstating
out-of-state charges fom non-
residents at two schools.

A 16 percent increase,
amounting to $100, is also
expected by the 24,000 students
at North Dakota’s public col-
leges. If a bill regulating the
student’s share of total edu-
cational expenses passes in the

North Dakota legislature, tui-

tion could double. ~
Not all schools, of course, will
experience such dramatic inc in-

creases, and come next fall, the .
proposed increases may be ~

watered down. But most stu-
dents can expect to spend more
in the tuition line, if not this
year, then in the next few years.

The reason, experts say, is
that schodls will have to use
tuition to augment one or more
of thése factors: inflationary

“pressures and costs, declining

enrollment (which doesn’t al-
ways mean declining costs), and
increasingly-parsimonious state
funding, which will be often-

‘times complicated by ‘‘tax-
cutting fever.” :
Administrators tend to point

most frequently to inflation as
the culprit. Dartmouth presi-
dent John Kemeny pegged in-
flation as the “largest single
threat to financing of private
higher education,’” after an-
nouncing that tuition is sched-

uled.tp go up $450 next fall.
dministrators

Tufts a said well
over half of its proposed in-
crease was due to inflation.
Student leaders at Tufts ac-
knowledged that some inflation-
ary expenses were expected, but
posited that they should at least
stay within the suggested seven
percent increase of President
Carter's wage and Price Stabili-
ty guidelines. Tufts, financial
aid officials countered that.

"The reply is typical, as many.

(Ron Chapple)

administrators claim to have
made ‘‘good-faith’’ efforts to
stay within the seven percent
mit. At Stanford, for example,
the trustees aimed for the
guidelines, but came up with an
8,9 percent increase in under-
graduate assessment, and a
13.5 percent increase in med
school tuition. For Stanford,
they said, the wage-price guide-
lines raise “‘serious conceptual
anc calculational difficalties.”’
But while inflations tolls are

’ hard to document, the effects of

the enrollment decline are only
too clear. A number of schools
are compensating by raising
tuition, if not for undergrads,
then for graduate, foreign and
non-resident students. The Uni-
veristy of North Carolina sys-
tem, for one, is facing a possible
10 percent tuition increase for
in-state students and 24 percent

_ for out-of-staters. At U-Mass, a

measure passed last summer
raising non-resident tuition
from $1550 to $3150 in the next
three years. Two bills in the
Texas senate would triple grad-
uate student tuition, and nearly
double foreign student tuition.

Regardless of how tuition
amounts-are assigned, though,
the major income to public
colleges come by way of state
appropriation, and those
amounts greatly ininennce tui-
tion. rates.

“There’s a trend in the seven-
ties for states to invest less in
higher education,”’. agrees Dr.
Jay Stanteb of the American
Association of State Colleges
and Universities. Thus, tuition
is certain to be used to offset the

trend. SUNY trustees suggest-.

The reprimand from Meetze

There are, moreover, increas-
ing indications that not all
taxpayers want to aid higher
education as in the past. Many
people feel higher education
should be a luxury, and the bill
should be footed by those who
receive it.

Thus, a number of states are
attempting to increase the per-
centage a student pays of the
cost of education. Nationwide,
that share averages about 22
percent. At U-Mass, the cur-
rent level is 15 percent. The bill
it sponsored to that effect is in
the legislature, along with a
measure that forces non-resi-
dents to assume 95 percent of
the costs of education.

The Foundation’s bill was
introduced at about the same
time that Massachusetts Gov-
ernor Edward King announced
that the 1980 budget for higher
education would contain little or
no increase over 1979. Founda-
tion president, Richard Manley,
thinks that action provides all
the more incentive for student-
supported education. ‘“There’s a
tear-ass electorate out there as
far as taxes are concerned, and

_Governor King is playing to it,”

he commented. ‘‘This being the
case, it makes sense for those
who can afford it to pay for their
education.”

However, Rolland had some
criticisms about the Grievance
Procedures. “It. makes no pro-
vision by which an employee
can complain to anybody who is
not hostile to his complaint.”
He: feels that “it .is very
desirable to be able to complain
to the immediate supervision by
it is bad because it is the only
option. ’’ He continued saying
that: “most of his. co-workers
find it difficult to bring forth a
legitimate complaint because
they fear losing their job. It
takes an awfully strong charac- —
ter to complain when his only
legitimate place to complain is
to his management, who is
directly the person to whom he
has his grievance. Yet when a
complaint is made to anyone
else, it is grounds for disci-
pline.”’

Rolland suggested that the
Grievance Procedure \“‘has a
fatal flaw. It would help if there
was some neutral ear earlier

_along the line than before the

formation of the ad hoc commit-

. tee.

“TI believe that it is a much
broader problem concerning the
question of how can an emplo-
yee raise questions about his
work.” He concluded, “I’m not
sure there is any way.”
