GAMECOCKS BATTLE HARD

(Continued from Page 4)

Although the two teams split first
places evenly, King of Furman ac-
counted for four himself. He placed
first in the high hurdles, the discus,
shot put, and the high jump. His
discus throw was 131 feet and high
jump 5 feet 10 1-2 inches.

Wade Barrow ran the 220 yard
dash in 23.5 and the 220 low hurdles

in 28.1 to win the two events.
Gregory's winning time on the 440
yard dash was 54 seconds. The
broad jump was taken by Dickson
with a jump of 20 feet 9 1-2 inches,

and Peabody placed second.

Captain Billy Merchant ran the
two mile race in 10:29 with Brown
and Parcell placing second and
third. Besides making a clean sweep
of the two mile run, Davidson men
took all places in the pole vault

and javelin. Furman won the shot
put and discuss entirely.

The pole vault went to 11 feet
with Pitman, and Fort in a
three way tie. Johnston's throw, of
154 fect 5 inches won the javelin.
Mosely and Pearce finished second
and third. Rohr of Furman ran the
hundred i 10.1 which was excellent
time on the wet track. Both mile
and half mile were won by Fur-
man runners.
