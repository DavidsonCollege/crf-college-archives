Eclectic ‘Davidson Show’ debuts with laughs

By SAMANTHA TALLEY
Staff Writer

“What’s going on at Davidson College?”

To find out, you could check The Crier or
read The Davidsonian. Now you can also go
to http://www.deub.org/tds and watch the
latest episode of the “Davidson Show.”

Although the first episode aired less than a
month ago on Nov 13, the idea for the show
has been around for two decades. “We were
inspired by DCTV, a show that existed back
in 1990,” producer and Union Board
Publicity Chair Austin Bell ’10 explained.
“The show itself is not an independent
organization but a Davidson production
approved by the Media Board.”

The show does not cover the same infor-
mation as The Crier or The Davidsonian.
“Our goals are to provide a new perspective
on events going on at the College and inform

students about them in a way that is thought-
provoking and entertaining.”

For example, the first episode opened with
a conversation between anchors Christie
Mason and Darrell Scott about the “Tommy
Ross” bear that Christie built that weekend,
which then led into a montage of students’
responses to the new President’s first 100
days in office.

Next came a weekend update promoting
David Dennis’s performance at the Outpost,
followed by interviews with Mayor-Elect
John Woods and Professor Hassan El
Menyawi. The quirky questions and answers
included with the more generic rhetoric
make these segments particularly amusing.

One memorable response occurred when
Dr. Menyawi well asked if anyone has ever
told him he looks like Roger Federer. With a
laugh, Dr. Menyawi confirmed, “Lots of
people have said that actually. I don't know

how to respond to that. I suppose maybe I
do.”

A series of clips from basketball games
follows the interviews, and the show con-
cluded with a rather unique take on movie
reviews called “Naked at the Movies.” In
this segment, two students, Patrick
Fitzgerald and Tyler Lemons, gave
“Davidson” grades to “American Gangster”,
“P2,” “Lions for Lambs” and “Fred Claus.”

“My favorite part by far is the fact that the
show instantly turns any student into a star,”
Bell commented.

“This will help us achieve our goal of get-
ting as many viewers as possible because
people love watching people they know do
unique things. We also hope to get lots of
students involved. For example, we feature

commercials for upcoming events, mostly
those of the Union Board, but we would
eventually like to cover all campus organiza-
tions.”

Bell believes the show will enrich both the
academic and social realms. “I would defi-
nitely like to see it go on a weekly basis,
pending student involvement, and I would
love to see it become involved with the Film
and Media Studies Concentration. There isn't
really any fusion of academics with extracur-
ricular activities, so I think it would definite-
ly be an interesting opportunity for students,
especially since it teaches so much about
production.”

If you didn't catch the second installment
in the union yesterday, be sure to find it
online. You won't be disappointed!
