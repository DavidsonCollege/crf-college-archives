A ‘Balanced’ Picture

The “other side” campaign which
appeared this week in an effort to
challenge fraternity rush doesn’t have
a chance. When the accepted bids
come back from freshmen Monday
morning, the fraternity system’s toe-
hold on Davidson’s one-sided social
life will be renewed.

America should be so secure.

Joe Murphy’s speech on Tuesday
and the series of letters from a group
of Independents to the rushees con-
stitute a gratifying effort to give the
other side of the picture. But, in the
end. it will be futile because the pic
ture they want to balance can’t be
balanced. There is really no other
side.

There is, regrettably. no alternative
to the fraternity system here. Either
you're in one or you're not, and even
the proudest Independent will concede
that in terms of material advantages,
a fraternity has it all over the Union.
What do you think of the mystic good-
ies and the bonds of brotherhood is
only secondary.

To use the old line: a typical fresh-
man’s choice is which fraternity to
join, not whether he should join one
at all.

Rush. Murphy noted Tuesday. is a
“brilliant display of the worst, frater-
nities have to offer.” It is shallow. su-
perficial and stupid. A five-minute

conversation can constitute “knowing”
somebody, and on many priority lists.
a freshman’s drinking habits and
“eool” can count for more than his
study habits.

Rush hurts everybody involved. it
hurts the fraternities because it com-
pels them to impose shallow criteria
on rushees, and the freshmen are hurt
because those criteria are imposed on
them. And. of course, the fraternity
system’s most heinous crime is the
hurt it inevitably leaves in many of,
those it rejects. .

If there were an alternative to fra-
ternities—if there were something to
eliminate a student's predestination of
being either a brother or a reject of a
system—then maybe the fraternity
system would not reek so.

It is the responsibility of the college
to provide social opportunities. in one
form or the other. to everybody, just
as it is its responsibility to provide
educational opportunities. If it can’t

_do that through a juiced up fraternity

system, as apparently it can’t, then
that system ought to be supplemented
or junked.

In short, the college owes some-
thing more to those whom the fra-
ternity system doesn’t want and those
who don’t want the fraternity system.
And it is the duty of everybody to
see that the college pays up.

The Chance To Gripe.

For all the talk about the adminis-
tration's openness. it is still plentv
hard for most students to get through
to an administrator to ask him a ques-
tion or air a grievance.

And so both suggestions we heard
this week on that very matter bear
some attention.

The first came from President
Spencer himself. He suggested that he
and the two deans appear periodical-
ly at chapel to answer questions and
clarify policy. The same sort of thing
‘was done at Mary Baldwin, he said.
and it worked very well.

ROTC’s

For months now, the best defense
of compulsory ROTC at Davidson has
been: make it voluntary, and if will
perish.

Surveys taken of military science
students here by the ROTC Depart-
ment make it clear that going volun-
tary would indeed reduce drastically
the number of students in the pro-
gram. Furthermore. the department
contends that it would be impossible
to maintain a program here without a
certain namber of students.

The argument, which may be valid.
has been enough to convince the trus-
tees to. stav with a compulsory pro
gram. While the trustees undoubted-
ly see many evils in ROTC, particu-
larly compulsory ROTC, at Davidson,
they have maintained that it is better
than no program at all.

But perhaps we are jumping to con-.
clusions in assuming that a smaller
program could not. survive. A tele-
phone survey this week of four other
schools with ROTC departments re-
veals that, at least elsewhere, ROTC
can survive with reduced participa-
tion. .

At Texas Christian Universitv.
which has over 2,000 male students in
its student body. the professor of mil-
itarv science reported 82 first-year
students, 38 second year, 34 third year
and 40 fourth year. TCU’s program is
voluntarv.

The University of Tennessee went
voluntary less than two years ago, one
of its military instructors told us, “and
if anvthing, the number of commis-
sioned officers has picked up.” He re-
ported 130 third-vear students and 118
fourth-year at UT.

The other came from the University
of Chicago, which has recently insti-
tuted the position of student ombuds-
man. The student in that position will
receive student grievances and, at his
discretion, bring them to appropriate
people or institute investigations. He
will issue quarterly public reports de-
scribing in general what his activities
have been.

Either one of the schemes would
probably have prevented the embar-
rassing cafeteria fiasco last month, not
to ‘mention other problems, and for
that reason we'd be glad to see either
one, or both, in effect here.

‘Survival’

The most encouraging word came

-from the PMS at Bowdoin, a school in

Brunswick, Me., that resembles David-
son in many respects. At Bowdoin.
which has a senior class of only 200,
the ROTC program is doing well de-
spite the fact it has only 20 seniors,
the PMS said. Bowdoin's program has
been voluntary since 1950. .

A parallel with William and Mary
would not be fair, perhaps. since the
student body has some 2,000 males.
But the assistant PMS there told us
there were 147 freshmen, 100 sopho-
mores, 90 juniors and 81 seniors in
the program, voluntary since 1947.
And he struck a blow for voluntary
programs in general:

“To be worthwhile, there should be
sufficient student interest and moti-
vation.”

Compulsory ROTC is wrong. A col-
lege with a Christian commitment has
got no business requiring military sci-
ence of its students, especially a col-
lege that says, in a much ballyhooed
code, that its students are men of re-
sponsibility, capable of making their
own decisions.

Consider also the case. of one out-
standing student who did not come to
Davidson because of ROTC. One of
the finalists for a Rhodes Scholarship
this year said that compulsory ROTC
here was “the most significant rea-
son” he chose the University of Vir-
ginia sver Davidson.

In light of compulsory ROTC’s basic
incompatibility with Davidson and the
success of other schools with smaller,
voluntary programs, perhaps our own
institution could stand another evalu-
ation.

On Being Propositioned

Sarah Lawrence has a proposition.
She wants men. ,

Steady there. Sarah Lawrence is not
a girl—she’s 300 girls, in a college in
New York. And she says she needs
men.

A dozen male transfers are already
studying at the previously all-female
institution, and for next year they
want 65 more. It's step 2 in the col-
lege’s implementation of a coeduca-
tional program.

Judging from the college’s official
information release at least, Sarah
Lawrence has a lot to offer a guy.
Enough, certainly, to induce a David-

son man away from his life of barren
weeks and suitcase weekends.

There’s more at Sarah Lawrence,
however, than its most valuable re-
source, girls. Consider these for teas-
ers: small classes, no required pro-
grams, no rigid system of prerequi-
sites, no competitive grading system,
much field work, and community
service. Davidson lacks in those only
a little less than it lacks in girls.

Interested? Catalogues and applica-
tions can be had by writing to Miss
Alice M. Bovard, director of admis-
sions, Sarah Lawrence College, Bronx-
ville, N. Y., 10708. Deadline for appli-
cations is Feb. 10.

‘Maybe You'd Like To See Our Coke Machine’

Waste

By DAVID SWEATT
Managing Editor
Davidson students who will
soon be officers in the mili-
tary would do well to take
notice of some of the situ-
ations they may face there.
Some will find. themselves
disenchanted with the mili-
tary itself. no doubt, and
anxious only to serve their
time and return to civilian

life.

What is important is that
they not become a part of
the problem: And_ indica
tions are that there are great
problems in the armed ser-.
vices today. As short ‘term
soldiers and long term citi-
zens, there is implicit in
military service the obliga
tion to observe the things
that are wrong and try to
correct them.

Last week it was disclosed
that members of the armed
forces were part of a fan-
tastic graft scheme that
stole more than half the gas-
oline and jet fuel the U.S.
sent to Thailand in a single
year, The amount stolen was
worth about a million dol-
lars.

A striking amount. we
would say. Yet how much
more money leaves the pub-
lic coffers in unnecessarv ex
penditures for the military
every year?

A case recently brought to
light demonstrates how easily
such a misuse of public funds
can be effected. The USS
Puget Sound. a new des-
troyer tender. was commis
sioned at Bremerton. Wash-
ington last year and prompt-
ly brought to the east coast
where its crow is being re-
duced to a minimum — the
ship to stay in Boston harbor.

Taking the ship out of op-
eration might ‘seem a waste.
but the move came at a
time when the Navy was ef-
fecting a service-wide ‘‘econ-

AW \h

- Is It SOP?

omy drive’’.

The painful part for the
taxpayer is the top level
sleight of hand that during
this economizing period or-
dered extensive alterations
on a ship only a few months
old for making, it more pre-
sentable as a flagship. These
alterations on a ship designed
as a flagship!

According to one officer
on board. the Navy Bureau
of Ships refused a request to
make the beautifying alter-
ations hefore the ship left
the civilian shipyard — the
civilian price tag for the
work-a fat 2.7 million dollars.

An enlisted man took it up-
on himself to question what
he and most of the ship‘s
1200-man crew considered ex-
orbitant changes. Not only
were the alterations unneces-
sary, but unsafe as well. in
his judgment. Since the ship
is a. tender, she had suffi.
cient men and material to
make even such large scale
changes. Work was schedul-
ed around the clock. It has
been in progress for a num.
ber of weeks.

Escape hatches have been
closed off and one large non-
reg hatch installed that lim-
its to one the possible route
of escape for the men who
work in that section of the
ship. Ponderous bulkheads
have . been moved. Water
mains for fire protection have
been moved. Priority electri-
cal switches, because they
were unsightly in their wall
positions, have been put be-
hind a false ceiling. con-
cealed and out of reach.

Wood panelling, carpeting
and soon-to-be-installed brass
handrails now grace the
entryway.

The enlisted man’s attempts
to question what appeared
to be capricious fiat from
the admiral in command
led him finally to his con-

Currie To Slater:

Shape Up, Or...

ED. NOTE: The following
is a Dec. 14 letter of Busi-
ness Manager Robert A. Cur-
rie to Clarence E. Slater,
vice president of ARA Slater
Services in Atlanta. The let-
ter was written during the
eyaluation of the Union cafe-
téria situation prompted by
the cafeterie’s “C” rating
from the Health Department.

Dear Clarence:

During the first term of
this 1968-69 school year, we
find widespread student dis-
satisfaction with our food
service. Upon investigation I
find this dissatisfaction justi.
fied. I also find that the cau-
ses involve college adminis-
trative procedures as well as
Slater. ,

According to the present
contract, termination may be
effected as of the end of any
accounting period by giving
not less than sixty days writ-

en notice. We expect Slater
to take immediate steps to
bring our food service to the
desired level, which should
be high. On April 1 we will
review the matter and unless
the service is satisfactory to
both the college and students.
we will give notice that the
contract is to be terminated
on June 8. 1969.

In anticipation of this de-
sired level, we would like
for Slater to continue its
study of a new meal ticket
plan and other desirable
changes for the 1969-70 school
year. Our budget process
will begin in February and
all recommendations should
be completed by then. We
desire that suggestions from
our students be a part of
this process for now and the
future.

Sincerely,
Robert A. Currie

gressman. His letter to the
congressman brought speedy
reaction and he was called
up for an extended ‘“‘inter-
view" with several of the
ship's brass.

Several letters were ex-
changed between the enlist-
ed man and the office of
Rep. Mendal Rivers. chair-
man of the House Armed
Services Committee, and also
the enlisted man’s congress-
man, and several other let.
ters never got through.

The reaction of. the com-
mander who ordered the
work was a letter which fail-
ed to answer in any detail
the questions as to the cit-
cumstances and authorization
for the work.

Can he get off that easily?

The enlisted man returned
to his ship after Christmas
to find that he had suddenly
been transferred.

What happens now? The
sailor says he will try one
more time to get some satis-
faction from the office of
Congressman Rivers. If he
gets no satisfaction then, he
may try other channels.

Is this the way it will end?

Is this the way other such
cases are “resolved'’?

Capricious expenditure has
no place in the armed ser-
vices when some enlisted
men still earn a_ poverty
wgae. It has no place in the
budget of a nation that still
has not met the basic sur-
vival needs of all its citizens.

The Making Of An Independent

leome, freshmen Independents. _

By Monday, you'll be a part of the invisible brother-
hood. The absence of a pledge pin will be your badge.

To be sure you make it, here’s a checklist of atti-
tudes and appearances you should effect. Rush isn’t
quite over yet, so read this carefully. Otherwise you
might get a bid, even.

The enaking of an Independent starts long before
he ever arrives at Davidson. A certain naivete is vital.

First, you must believe that people
are basically sincere and that mere
appearances are not important. |

Second, an aura of sexual and
social virginity is necessary. Just
just remember that there are 10
Independent studs and that Indepen-
dents know nothing whatsoever about
winning friends and influencing peo- * -

le. ;

P Third, prior to your arriva) at .
Davidson, practice the pose of an

intellectual. Intellectual pursuits

must be much more important to

you than boozing and broads, or any of the fleshly
pastimes. You must arrive at Davidson with a well-
practiced scholarly pose. ;

Fourth, to be an Independent, there are some things
that you absolutely may not be: a hard-core jock, and an
all-round good guy. So with this in mind, develop
some neuroses and the proper physique. Everyone
knows that Independents are psychological kooks.
And for Independency, thinness almost to the point
of emaciation or gross overweight are definite assets.
Just don’t let anyone ever think that you get any
exercise, ever. You might be mistaken for a jock,
which is a definite disadvantage. ;

Now, upon arrival at Davidson, with all your social
ungainliness intact, here’re a few hints to assure
your membership in the invisible brotherhood. _

First, approach the question of fraternities with a
completely open mind. Honestly believe that you will
be judged for what you are, not what you appear to
be. Believe that your own good qualities of sincerity
and integrity will be noticed and appreciated.

Second, meet as few upperclassmen as possible.
Concentrate on making wide friendships within the
freshman class, but avoid forming close friendships
with shallow and slick classmates. Just remember
that there are no slick Independents, and be sure to
appear as gauche as possible to the upperclassmen
who may stray across your path.

Third, know as little about the fraternities on camp-
us as possible. Be sure to consider each house on the
court and honestly believe that the same consideration
will be given you.

Fourth, be sure to be impressed with the academic
reputation of Davidson, and study like hell. Date as
little as possible, or if you date, date the biggest pig
available. Never, absolutely never, be seen at any piace
or function where people are socializing, especially
when beer and liquor are being consumed.

And now for a few hints for you would-be Indepen-
dents during rush.

Appearances are vital. Wear the shabbiest coat and
tie you own or can borrow, preferably with white
socks and black unpolished shoes with very pointed
toes. Don’t get a haircut, shave hurriedly, and eat
lots of chocolate so you can raise a nice crop of pimples.

Talk about your class work constantly. Appear
nervous and ill at ease. If you can manage it, spill a
cup of punch on something, or someone, especially
the rush chairman.

Don’t wait to be invited: ask to see the basement or
the fraternity’s scrapbook.

So if you've played the game right, and paid atten-
tion to all of the cardinal rules of the game, by Monday
you’ll have made it. You'll be an Independent.

Just remember to laugh about the whole situation.
You may have just blown your chances for a viable
social life for the next four years, but you weren't
really interested in that in the first place, were you?
Or were you?
