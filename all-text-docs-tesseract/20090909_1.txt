SGA transcript cover letter remains controversial

Kara JONES
Staff Writer

Most Davidson students agree
that this is a tough school: the work
is hard, it comes in large amounts
and getting the grades we were
used to in high school is more dif-
ficult, if not impossible. Grades
are not inflated, as they are at the

vast majority of nationwide institu-
tions, and since the college admits
a bright bunch to begin with, com-
petition is much higher as well.
Students are continually frustrated
that many graduate schools and
employers have never heard of Da-
vidson’s high standards, and do not
realize that a Davidson 3.0 might
be equivalent to a 3.5 elsewhere.

Last fall the college conducted
a study comparing the average
Davidson GPA with the GPAs of
nine peer institutions (small liberal
arts colleges). President Tom Ross
shared the results with the SGA: of
the ten schools, Davidson had the
lowest average GPA at 3.18, with
the average of the other schools be-
ing more in the area of 3.5. Many

SGA members thought something
should be done about this, and
while they realized they should not
argue for grade inflation, and rec-
ognized the good that Davidson’s
high standards bring, they thought
a mechanism should be put in place
to describe the rigor of Davidson
to graduate schools and employers,
who do not know Davidson as they
do a brand name like Harvard.

Jenner Gibson °11, who was a
strong advocate in the SGA for the
letter said, “One of the biggest con-
cerns was for students applying to
international schools and jobs who
likely have never had a Davidson
student. They have no idea of our
reputation.”

The cover letter issue was en-
trusted to The Academic Policy
Committee of the SGA, and this
committee, as well as a committee
from the faculty, worked together
through the end of the spring 2009
semester to draft a cover letter that
all members approved.

Some students and faculty
strongly disagreed with the purpose
and content of the cover letter after
the first draft, which contained a
great deal of information, includ-
ing Davidson student SAT scores,
admissions figures and paragraph
explanations of the difference be-
tween Davidson and other institu-
tions.

Opponents argued that an ef-
fective cover letter needed to be
brief, precise and to the point. They
pointed out that those looking at
resumes would have to be able to

Opening of the Court to replace First Night Down

. KELLY WILSON
Staff Writer

This year two aspects of first-
year students’ orientation to the so-
cial aspects of Davidson are chang-
ing. “First Night Down,” when
freshmen are introduced to life on
Patterson Court, has been renamed
“Opening of the Court” and will
occur on a Monday (September
14) rather than a Friday. The sec-
ond change is that the Big Broth-
ers, Big Sisters program has been
eliminated.

“These changes have come to
us as an initiative from students,”
said Dr. Patty Perillo, Director
of Residence Life and Associate
Dean of Students. “There has been
so much focus on this First Night
Down that we’ve lost sight of the
original intent of what this was all
about to begin with—keeping the
first few weeks on campus as a
time for first-years to connect with
each other, but not yet to Patterson
Court, because that’s a whole dif-

ferent layer of social life.”

In response, the campus hosted
its inaugural Wildcat Welcome
Week this year, which included a
variety of social events for first-
year students, intended to help ac-
quaint them with college life.

“In the past, there was this in-
tense focus on the Friday night
event because all the houses had
parties,” Perillo said. “But this year
we wanted to change the focus.
When we say starting on Monday
the 14" this year, that means that at
any point in time starting on Mon-
day—throughout the week, the
weekend and beyond—students can
go down to the Court. Our hope is
that this big buildup of hype, anxi-
ety and excitement about this one
event on campus would be diffused
and spread out a bit.”

Another reason for the change
was to encourage both eating hous-
es and fraternities to become more
aware of how they present them-
selves to freshmen. “When it came
to First Night Down, there wasn’t

a whole lot of thinking about how
each house wanted their welcom-
ing to be different and unique,”
Perillo said.

“It really just became this
weekend when everybody had par-
ties,” she continued. “We went to
Patterson Court leaders this year
and asked them to get back to the
original intent—to think about
how it is that they could open their
houses and make them unique and
welcoming to first-year students.
As Patterson Court becomes more
intentional and thoughtful about
how to let first-years experience a
particular house or fraternity, our
hope is that this creates a better
first-year experience.”

Perillo noted that studies show
28 percent of Davidson students
choose not to drink. The focus on
the drinking aspect of First Night
Down made some of these students
fee] uninvited and unwelcome.

The calendar this year also
presented a logistical challenge
to having First Night Down on a

weekend. “Clearly we didn’t want
first-years down on the court the
first two weekends —it just doesn’t
make sense,” Perillo said. “The
third weekend was Homecoming
Weekend, when alumni will come
back to those houses. There’s a fair
amount of socializing and drinking
on this weekend, so it might not be
the best place for first-years. The
next weekend is Rosh Hashanah,
which is a really important holi-
day for many students. By the next
weekend it would have been five
weeks out, and we didn’t want to
wait that long.”

Reactions to the changes in
First Night Down this year vary
widely among upper-class students.
“IT do not think First Night Down
should be moved to a Monday, and
I am worried about the precedent
Monday night will set for party-
ing that entire week,” Second Belk
hall counselor Caroline Fortney ’11
said. “Opening of the Court was
