30 years, Davidson’s men’s cross country
team finished fourth in this past weekend’s
Southern Conference Championships in
Charleston,’S.C.

- §SoConRunner ofthe Year Jesse Norman,
a junior from Western Carolina University,
crossed the finish line in a time of 24:49 to
win the race.

- Not far behind was top Wildcat Dan Gibson
”02, who shaved nearly a minute and a half off
his season’s best to take an amazing 6th place
in 25:05—the fourth fastest time in
Davidson’s history.

Backing Gibson’s lead were outstanding
performances from the rest of the team. Brad
Becken ’03 was the next to cross the line,
sneaking in under the 26-minute mark for the
first time in his career, with a 25:59.

Rounding out the scoring for Davidson
were Andrew Schoewe ’03 (26:17), Chris
Schmader ’04 (26.34), Jimmy Swansbrough
’03 (26:51), Jay Jahnes ’02 (26:58), and Dave
Bunge ’03 (26:59). ;

Kevin Bell ’05, and Colby Broadwater ’04
finished with respective and very respectable
times of 27:05 and 27:49.

These outstanding times placed the Wild-
cats fourth in the field of 11 in the their best
conference meet since 1964, when they placed
fourth out of eight teams.

The men’s score, 134, edged out UNC-
Greensboro, East Tennessee State Univer-
sity, and Furman by a mere 13 points.

This outstanding season was summed up
by an extremely happy head coach Gary
Andrew, “These guys did what they needed
to do, they got out there and raced and did not

back down. This has been what we’ve been
working towards all year, and they were
finally able to bring it all together and show
the conference that Davidson is a team to be
reckoned with.”

will be the NCAA Regionals in Greenville,
S.C. at Furman University Sat., Nov., 10.

were, on the whole, faster this season than in
previous years. However, Davidson stood up
to these challenges as the season’s- training
paid off during the race.

Head coach Jennifer Straub said, “The team
ran very strong and improved their seventh
place showing from last year. The team ran in
a cohesive pack and showed our improve-
ment by placing four runners in the top thirty.

season in the years to come.”

Sophomore Elizabeth Trexler added, “The
team’s not just about racing. The friendships
we’ ve made through cross country (and track)
have beén some of the most rewarding I’ve
made while here. We’re not just runners,
we’re friends. This year has been the most
fruitful thus far, and, in my opinion, we can
only advance from here.”

meet of their season, the Regional Champi-
onships, at Furman University November 10.

touchdowns to spark Davidson’s offense.

With 9:52 left in the fourth quarter and trailing 29-7, the

Hampden-Sydney looked strong early, putting the first

points of the game on the board on a hook-and-ladder pass in
the first quarter. The Wildcats answered just before the end of
the first quarter on a six-yard run by Gibson. The defense
provided the field position for the seven-play, 50-yard drive
with a fourth-down stop at midfield. During the drive, David-
son was faced with a fourth down of its own, but junior
quarterback Paul Nichols found sophomore Barrett Johnson
on a 14-yard strike. :

Despite having the football for only five of the 15 minutes
in the second quarter, the ‘Cats still found a way to score a pair
of touchdowns. Junior fullback Wesley Wooten provided the .
first scoré with a two-yard run, just his second rush of the
season and the first touchdown of his collegiate career.

The 62-yard TD reception for Gibson was delivered by
Nichols to give Davidson a 21-7 lead at the half. The Wildcats
traversed 80 yards in the three-play drive, with the other 18
yards coming on Gibson runs.

The third quarter was all Davidson as the defense allowed
