Love of Learning enjoys another successful summer

By Mary Clare Jalonick

This July Davidson hosted the
Love of Learning program for the
eighth year. African-American
high school students from the Char-
lotte area lived in Cannon for four
weeks and took classes on campus.

The program focuses on de-
veloping the intellectual, physical
and spiritual aspects of each teen-
ager. The program focuses on the
recruitment and retention of mi-
nority students by colleges and
universities.

The students had classes each
day from 7:45 a.m. through 8:30

p.m., taught mostly by Charlotte’ |

area high school teachers., The
classes prepare the teenagers in
oral and written English, math-
ematical skills, scientific inquiry,
SAT preparation and personal de-
velopment.

Freshmen Claytonia Boular
and Krissie Johnson graduated
from the Love of Learning pro-
gram this past summer. As they
begin their careers at Davidson as

college students, they appreciate
the self confidence that the eo;
gram instilled.

Boular said that Love of Learn-
ing encouraged her. to "always
strive for the best and to not give
up."

Love of Learning is a five-
year program which begins in the
eighth grade, although most stu-
dents are 10th, 11th and 12th grad-
ers. The teenagers, mostly from
single parent homes, are involved
in summer and academic programs
until the summer before their fresh-
man year in college.

Junior Lillian Montgomery
worked as ahall counselor for Love
of Learning this year. She lived
with the students and “interacted
with them constantly”. Montgom-
ery valued the experience, for she
seemed to benefit as well. ‘I
learned a lot about teenagers and
meeting them where they are.”

When asked if she would rec-
ommend the program to others,
Krissie Johnson said, "Definitely."

Students shovel their way through Cyprus in search of artifacts

By Andrew Smitherman

Davidson classes rarely re-
quire students to implement tools
such as picks or trowels and only
occasionally lead students to a
classroom snugly situated in a val-
ley of barley being laid to waste by
seering summer temperatures of
40 degrees Celsius. These condi-
tions, however, typify much of
what is Dayidson’s summer.Clas-,
sics program in Cyprus. During
the six week summer class, stu-
dents participate in an archaeo-
logical field school, study the his-
tory of the people of Cyprus, and
find themselves completely im-
mersed in a beautiful and unique
Meditterranean culture which
causes the bitter conditigns to melt.

July Experience
opens campus to

prospectives

By Anna Gray Anderson

“Ordering pizza at 11:00 pm,
playing tennis working out at
Baker, and shooting pool in the
union - what an exhausting experi-
ence!” July Experience counselor
Wendy McHugh talks about her
summer at Davidson. On July 10,

eighty rising high school seniors ©

‘joined McHugh and a Davidson
staff at the College fora three week
academic program.

Directed by Evelyn Gerdes
and Sterling Martin, the program
exposed the campers to the ex-
panse of activities which Davidson
offers.Each participant took two
classes taught by Davidson pro-
fessors. Though the students
worked hard, they found plenty of
time forfun. A square dance called
by Will Terry, a trip to Carowinds,
and a climb down the rapelling
tower were the highlights.

With the help of ten Davidson:

students who served as counse-
lors, the July Experience campers
viewed a microcosm of life at
Davidson. They left with a height-
ened understanding of the high
quality and unique environment
which Davidson embodies.

The program is based in the
village of Athienou which is situ-
ated between two of the largest and
most important cities of Cyprus:
Larnaca and the capital, Nicosic.
The site encompasses nearly 2600
years of settlement, Cypro-
Archeve (650 BCE) to the early
20th Century, and has been titled
Malloura according to references

‘The archaeological team | was.

composed of ‘thirty-individuals.
Thirteen students from Davidson,
Ohio State, and Kenyon College
participated in the actual field
school, while the remaining indi-
viduals were field supervisors and
specialists (including ceramicists,
artists and flora and fauna special-
ists).

The team faced work days
beginning at 6 a.m. and ending at2

‘p.m. After working in the field,

students were required to either
wash pottery or complete paper-

work. Classes were generally
scheduled three times weekly and
centered on such topics as Cypriot
history or archaeological tech-
nique. Nonetheless, students man-
aged to relax in the warm atmo-
sphere of local cafes.

Dr. Michael K. Toumazou,
Davidson professor and excava-
tion director, comments that the
Project experienced. @.productive
season. The discovery of two life-
size portions of statuary proved
expectations of the staff to be true.
Also, the site was visited by the

‘director of the Cypriot Department

of Antiquities. The director was
extremely impressed with the pro-
gram and declared the excavation
to be an official and ‘observable
archaeological monument. Now
the site will receive government
protection and support. Davidson
will hopefully host the director of
Cypriot Antiquites i in October as a
guest speaker.
