THE DAVIDSONIAN

BETA TAILBACK JACK SHERILL SETS FOR PASS
Gam Rusher Vainly Attempts A Tag

Betas, Taus Top IMAC;
Sig Eps Surprise KA's

By NEVILLE PATTERSON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Betas remained undefeat
ed Monday in IMAC flickerball
action when they snapped the
Phi Gam win streak 20-19. The
Betas are now 3-0 in IMAC com
petition and are tied for first
place with the ATO's, who also
have three wins against no
losses.

As explained by sports ana-
lyst Joe Rice, ‘the Betas prob-
ably have the most tested team
in the league."" Whatever this
means, they do have a quick,
powerful attack, balanced well
by a solid defense.

The ATO’s defeated the In-
dependents 18-6 and the Sigma
Nu’‘s 20-7 to remain in a tie for
first place. In the Independent
game, the ATO pass defense
proved very strong, hauling in
many key interceptions to stop
Independent drives. The ATO's
scored first on a roll out pass

from Dave Hardeman to Skip

Waite.

Another Hardeman to Waite
pass, this time a short one over
the middle, capped a long drive
and gave the ATO's their sec-
ond score. Their final TD was
made when an Independent pass
was intercepted and run back
all the way.

The Kappa Sigs remained un-
beaten as they turned back the
Phi Delts 26-18, in another im-
portant game. Sig defender John
McKinley intercepted two Delt
passes and ran one back for a
score.

The big factor in the Sig win,
though, was the offense. Tail
back Buddy Dubose threw three
long touchdown passes, two to
guard Jamie Bryant and the
other to end Arnie Goodstein.

The SPE’s, ied by scatvack Ed
Reynolds, squeezed by the high-
ly touted KA‘s 12-9 in what was
probably the biggest upset of
the week. Fine defensive play

By JOHN ALLEN
Davidsonian Sports Writer

A large Converse Day crowd
saw the Wildcat booters repeat
last year’s win over Oglethorpe
with an 8-1 romp Saturday.

Coach Harry Fogleman, soc-
cer mentor, commented om the
fine play throughout the game
and stated that everyone on the
squad got in for some exper-
ience. “Oglethorpe played a
much cleaner game than us-
ual,” he said, ‘‘but they are not
exceptionally tough competition
and were minus four of their

starters.”
Center Jan Brackel led the
scoring with three boots. The en-

tire front line, Kurt Pederson, |

Ben Nzengu, Lee Fanning, and
Lewis Foss each scored a goal,

Fogleman said that the offi-
cials and many of the spectators
called the battle one of the best
games they had ever seen. ‘We
played very well and our de-
fense, led by fullback Gus
Brown, was great,” said Fogle-
man in his analysis of the game.

The squad meets Duke today.
The contest, set for 2:30 on the
local field, will kick off Home-
coming activities. Coach Fogle-
man, in a preview of today’s
game, said, “Duke has essen-
tially the same kind of team
they had last year, so we are
looking for another victory over

DOWNTOWN CHARLOTTE

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

THEY COULD BE GREAT

Freshman basketball practice began yesterday, and,
despite the yearlings’ disappointing showing in the Fresh-
man-Sophomore game, it is hard not to be optimistic
jabout the team’s prospects.

Bobby Lane, Rod Knowles, Tom Youngdale, Cecil
Clifton, and Scott Sinnock, products of one of Lefty
| Driesell’s best recruiting year since coming to Davidson,
bring with them hopes of continuing the recently estab-
lished Davidson basketball tradition.

Sinnock and Lane will most likely play the wings in
Driesell’s 1-2-2 offense. Sinnock, from New Castle, In-
diana, played in the Indiana North Central, which Coach
Driesell calls “the best high school league in the coun-
try.” He averaged 23.7 points per game as a senior and
was elected to the Indiana All-State team.

Lane was All-State three years in New Orleans and
was described in La Sport magazine as Louisiana’s best
player in history. It notes, “The few that possessed
Lane’s natural talents, it is said, lacked his fiery compe-
titive spirit and unselfish attitude. Those who had his
will to win weren't blessed with his native ability.”

Knowles and Youngdale will team together on the
Davidson double pivot. Knowles, from Greenville, N.C.,
averaged over 20 points per game for each of his three
| years of high school ball. Picked on the Chicago Daily
News All-State team, Tom had a 23 point average for
Peru, Ill., last year in the Big Eight Conference, another
nationally known high school league.

Clifton will be the — of the Wildkitten of-
fense, according to Coach Driesell. A Georgia All-Stater
last year, Cecil averaged almost 18 points per game and
led his team from Avondale to the semifinals of the state
tournament.

Non-scholarship players counted on for considerable
action by freshman coach Terry Holland this year are
Pinky Hatcher, a guard from Columbus, Ga., George
Leight from Winson-Salem and Tom Clayton from Madi-
sonville, Ky.

Driesell comments on the game with the sopho-
mores, “Considering that this was the first time the fresh-
men have won the game since I have been here, I'd say
they played well. Remember that they haven't even
played together before this.”

The Wildkittens play an 18-game schedule against
| the likes of Duke, North Carolina, Clemson, Wake Forest
| and several Southern Conference schools. Coach Driesell

calls it the “toughest we've ever set up.”
They could be great.

‘DIBBLE vs. THE CANDIES

THE DAVIDSONIAN Croquet team has been estab-
lished as a ninety-to one favorite in tomorrow’s clash with
‘the Scripts and Pranks staff.

Leading the favorites in the tradition-rich encounter
|that was begun last year is jock-among-jocks Dribble
Dibble’s athletic prowess probably reached its
| zenith in glory when he hit himself in the back of the
| head with a softball during his freshman p. e. tests.

Also on the winning team are Fat Charlie Smith and
Foetus Clark.

All of the Scripts and Pranks team members are
pretty insignificant and thus aren’t worth mentioning.
However, since this column is so broad-minded and ob-
jective, it is printing Scripts and Pranks captain Pete
Crow’s prediction, made in a burst of wit exceptionally
uncommon among staff members of the would-be hu-
mor magazine.. Says Crow, “We figure we'll be able to
beat Dibble’s conservative game.”

Retorted Dibble, ‘We expect to roll over Crow’s
| blackbirds by such a liberal figure that they'll give up
| croquet and take up crocheting.”

Asked for a prediction, the DAVIDSONIAN star add-
|ed, “They’ve got a fine team but our boys have been
| working real hard, pointing toward this game. If we
get out there and really hustle, I think we can win, es-
pecially since I doubt that Crow's candies will show.”
