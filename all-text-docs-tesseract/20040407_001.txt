Public Safety shake-up

New personnel additions raise questions
about ties to Cornelius Police Department

By Les.it HEMPSON
Senior Staff Writer

Fountain Walker, Director of Pub-
lic Safety and Police, recently hired
part-time patrol Sgt. Jonathan Sarver
to replace Lt. Jim Lyon as Assistant
Director.

Lyon said he was terminated by the
College on Jan. 5, exactly three
months before Sarver officially as-
sumed the Assistant Director posi-
tion.

Counting Sarver, roughly half of
all Public Safety employees pres-
ently work for or previously worked
for the Cornelius Police Department.

Assistant Director Sarver

Sarver, who took a part-time job
with Davidson one year ago, was
formally offered the Assistant Direc-
tor job on Mar. 17. He submitted his
letter of acceptance to the Office of
Human Resources on Mar. 26.

Asst. Dir. Jonathan Sarver

Sarver has worked in law enforce-
ment for 20 years. He was most re-
cently employed by the Cornelius
Police Department and continued
working at that job even after the
College hired him part-time.

Sarver previously worked at the
Huntersville and Town of Davidson
police departments and has an
Associate’s Degree in Law Enforce-

ment Technology.

Walker praised Sarver highly.

“He’s going to bring a lot to the
College. You’re talking about a guy
who has a lot of drive. He wants to
see things happen, not just for him-

~ self, but for others as well,” Walker

said.

Lyon’s Termination

Although Walker called Lyon’s
departure a “joint decision,” Lyon
said that he had been fired after two-
and-a-half years on the job.

According to Lyon, Walker in-
formed him on Jan. 5 that he had vio-
lated department policy by letting his
wife “carry [his] department-issued
cell phone” and would have to leave
his job.

“That’s the explanation [Walker]
gave me,” Lyon said. “That’s the
explanation [Director of Human
Resources] Carl Sorensen gave me
in his [termination] letter. Chief
Walker didn’t ask me to resign. He
terminated me.”

“Lyon explained that he had worked
late the night before the cell phone
incident, and after church the next
morning, decided to get some rest.

More students to get
on-campus housing

By Biair McGraw

Senior Staff Writer

The lottery process for next year’s
housing has gone better than RLO
originally expected.

Dean Leslie Marsicano, Director
of Residence Life said, ““We’ re feel-
ing alittle better about our prospects
of having a bed for everyone.”

The lottery has gone better than
expected primarily because of the
large number of students requesting
to go abroad or requesting to live in

off-campus housing.

“We had hoped for 150 students to
go abroad, but many more actually
applied,” Marsicano said. “More se-
niors than usual applied for off-cam-
pus, which has atrickle-down effect.”

The large number of students who
are planning to go abroad and live
off campus has freed up space on
campus.

This resulted in more space than
usual at the Senior Apartments dur-
ing Phase I of the lottery in March.

What do Warner’s Crush Party,
the Baseball Team, and eight
women in a small Nicaraguan vil-
lage have in common?

T-shirts.

Sanctuary, a Christian-based so-
cial justice organization of
Davidson Students, has recently
begun advocating the use of “sweat-
free” t-shirts made by the Women’s
Sewing Cooperative in Nueva Vida
(New Life), Nicaragua.

“It’s an easy way to support the
sustainable development by simply

cutting out the middle man,” said
Sanctuary’s Publicity Chair Nicole
Mader ’06.

While some on campus are imme-
diately supportive, Davidson Screen
Printers owner Ken Hageman asks
that people consider the effects on
workers welfare locally. Hageman
says that his business would be im-
periled if it lost the college’s busi-
ness.

Yet Sanctuary is asking fraterni-
ties, eating houses, sports teams, the
administration, and eventually the
College Bookstore to buy shirts from
the Coop and get them shipped di-

rectly to their normal screen printers °

‘Sweat-free’ t-shirts raise questions of fair trade

for final production.

College Chaplain Rob Spach has
taken Davidson students to Women’s
Coop in Nueva Vida at least two out
of the last five Alternative Spring
Break trips to Nicaragua.

“These women’s stories are just
amazing,” an enthused Spach said.
“They physically built this coopera-
tive themselves in the midst of tre-
mendous adversity. It’s such a great
alternative to.the sweat shop model.”

“Sweat shops” are generally de-
fined by inhumane practices that
exploit workers with few alterna-
tives, such as extremely low wages
compared to the standard of living

and unsafe working conditions.

Two of the students who went
with Spach to Nicaragua last year,
Morgan Gregson’06 and Anna
Brew 05, are also Sanctuary’s lead-
ing members.

They and others have recently
met with the Patterson Court Coun-
cil, the Student Athlete Council,
United Community Action, and the
Baker Equipment Staff.

They have made presentations on
how Davidson students can easily
model “socially responsible con-
suming” and why they oughtto, ac-
cording to Mader.

ITS searches
for cause of
slow network

By AMANDA STEPHENS
Senior Staff Writer

Over the past few months,
Davidson’s computer network has
been very slow to respond to appli-
cations such as Banner, Outlook,
public files on Louise, and other li-
brary applications.

The network’s slow response is
most noticeable during times of high
network usage. Despite continued

-efforts, ITS remains uncertain of the

problem.

Problems with the network were
first detected in October when the
Admissions Office noticed that Ban-
ner was responding very slowly.

Since that time, the network slow-
ness has affected many other appli-
cations.

Because reductions in network
speed happen intermittently, it has
been very difficult for ITS to iden-
tify the problem.

Due to students leaving Davidson
for the summer, network activity will
decrease significantly, making it
even more difficult to track the prob-
lem. ;

As aresult, it has become impera-
tive for ITS to identify the problem
quickly.

In an effort to fix the problem, ITS
has upgraded the software on
Davidson’s five core computer
switches, which are located in the
Belk Computer Lab, Chambers,
Baker Sports Complex, Cunningham
Fine Arts Building, and the Com-
puter Services Office.

Work on these main switches
showed that they were not part of the
problem.

ITS has also been loading and test-
ing new drivers for server network
cards and PC network cards. Net-
work cards, also known as Ethernet
cards, connect each computer to the
network.

In addition, ITS has also been
checking individual network cards,
requiring personnel to inspect com-
puters around the campus.

Because of differences between
manufacturers, inspecting network
cards can be a complicated and
lengthy process.

ITS has also had difficulty deter-
mining whether or not network slow-
