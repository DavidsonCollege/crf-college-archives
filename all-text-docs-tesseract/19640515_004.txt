Davidson Audience’ Takes

Chapel Speakers In Stride

By GREG GOVAN

“AH ‘students. are expected to attend a
designaied number. of these chapel and ves-
per services.’ Which is the same as saying
all men are expected to die.

Over the long hours in Chamber's Audi-
torium. the Davidson. audience has built up
a certain reaction to the expected nécessity
of chapel. Cut. You can save them all up
and not go for a whole month.

Or you may join the worried ones. who
take all their cuts at once lest the schodl
be destroyed in an atomic holocaust or ac:
of Providence (or both) and that many at-
tendances be wasted

But most of the time the students. are in
expected, if not expectful, attendance. This
poses a distinct problem for the speaker.

Many try to break the ice by putting stu- |

dents at their ease, e.g.. ‘I remember an-
other captive audience I had back. in S:alag
17.... A few freshmen laugh. the upper-,
classés heave an “on no”. and the waole
thing ‘s like Arab folk songs a° a Z:onjst
Tally.

Then there are the speakers who cap-zal-
izé on newspaper accounts. They work
Fuhrman or Scriven int6 ihéir opening °>
marks. The students react with a “"t:
nicée’-in thé form of hisses or murmur:

The most, popular opener jis. the p.2er.
whied. if long enough. saves the embarr
“ment of nodd‘ng oifearly in an 24

Davidson chapel-sitters may react in
different ways to the same things, de-
pending on who says them. If you are an
outsider with no claim upon the school,
appeal to basketball gets little. If you are
a Yankee and quote how tittle is being
done towards Northenizing the South,

there is applause.

The surest way to get attention is to es
tablish identity: you as ‘a speaker don’t
réally want to be there either. Col. W. L.
Adams did this four. years ago by saying
a very few words and dismissing chapel as
the best thing he could say. Standing (and
moving) ovation.

Or the students will sometimes react to
pet’ subjects. like drinking and running your
Corvette at 125 mph. The subject of sex,
however, is delicate, and advice to chapel
speakers might be, if you don't have it,
don’t talk about it.

Things aren’t as bad as they could be.
Three years ago the president of the Stu-
dent Body bawled out a chapel audience
for whistling in awe at a speaker's emi-
nent qualifications. And before our time
it is reputed that a dulf speaker might
look up from his notes and see a rusiling
sea of newspapers, umbrellas and hand-
passed students. But that was back when
they used fo type term papers in the bal-
cony during vespers.

An audience wyl sometimes sit spell-
bound by a speaker just because he or she
knows what he is talkirig about, or if even
30 famitiar.a. feature as a professor tells
something that 18 really true and really well
done. Or-if someone challenges the old
guard in a hew way.

But ff a speaker doesn’t look like he could
draw a voluntary crowd of over five or if
he plows the old furrows, standard diver-
sions begin:. sleeping, studying. following
the progress of .a low flying bird that stum-
bted in:o a forest of inviting heads.

The Davidson student in captivity is some-
what hostile, but not beyond reach. Or. the
only expectation in chapel is that you be
there, Things happen too seldom to expect
yourself to go.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

|Lake Norman Attracts

' ropes.

It was 84 feet long. its beam
measured 2732 feet. Its new
white paint job was still shiny,
with no blemishes. It was a big
boat,. painted like a candy wag-
on and made to travel over an
artificial, man-made lake.

But it did not seem out of
place: it seemed to be a natural
part of a natural body of water.

| Theisolating greyness of Tues-

day's cloudburst probably had a
lot to do with this illusion. The
raw. unfinished wood of the
moorings, soaked through with
wetness, added a lot to it too.

The mooring place is a half-
enclosed extension from the
shoreline over the water. It sur-
rounds on three sides the ‘‘Rob-
ert E. Lee’’ when the boat is
tethered. From its low roof are
suspended fish nets, and the
floor is planked.

“We want this to get good and
ugly."’ co-owner L. B. Grier said
Wednesday.

There is a refreshment stand
in one corner, a small office in
the other, and a ticket booth
and.a jukebox in between.

Grier and partner R. A. Hed-
rick, both of Statesville, con-
ceived the plan for the riverboat
when they heard about Duke
Electric Power Company’s plans
for ‘constructing Lake Norman,
They did research on Mississip-
pi River steamships and decid-
ed to make a replica of the old
“Robert E. Lee.”

They selected the present
site (on Highway 21, about three
miles north of the Davidson
turnoff) because of its strategic
location as the center of an
area whose population is two
million people. Its proximity to
the future Interstate Highway
17 was a further consideration.

Construction of the boat itself
began about a year ago, It was

finished largely within nine
months — “The same time it|
takes anything to be born,”

said Grier.

The “Robert E. Lee"’ can car-
ry as many as 150 people. de

It was also stressed that all

There were no charter voy-
ages on Wednesday, and Grier
was discussing other plans with
one of his workers. He was will-
ing to take time off to point out
special features of the ‘‘Robert

upper one serves as a cabin for

cruise. The lower two are used

weighs 36 tons, has a speed of
10 knots, and is diesel-powered.
It is actuaily propelled by its
own drive-side paddle wheels.
“So far as I know, it’s the only
one operating east of the Miss-
issippi,"” said Grier.

Lake Norman’s waters were choppy as a heavy storm beat down on them last
Tuesday, but Riverboat NC-68-H, the “Robert E. Lee,” rested undisturbed at its

gangplank, and two rest rooms
—one for ladies and one for
“Gentemen.”” It has a speaker
system, too, and powder bluc
chairs and’ benches to contrast
with its red trim.

The boat's safety features in- ;

clude high-pressure pumping for
fire hoses and enough styro-
foam in the hull to support 36
tons of weight.

What about. the enterprise's
future? Grier was optimistic.
Bookings for the boat had been
made into next September, and
long range plans, which the
partners “hope to make short
range soon,"’ involved the con-
verting of a five-acre island in-
to a midway stopping place
for passengers. There various
means of amusement would be
provided.

Now it takes a rainstorm to ~

make the “Robert E. Lee’
seem at home on Lake Norman.
But the time may come when
it does not.

AWARDS STILL GIVEN

Years Shorten Commencement

By TOM LOFLIN

Since the first graduating
class in 1840 proudly pick-
ed up diplomas, the com-
mencement program at Da-
vidson has changed signifi-
cantly. That year, each sen-
ior was held in such esteem
that he was allowed to
speak a few, or many, words
during the program.

This year, there will be no
speeches at all. No commence-
ment speaker will rise to chal-
lenge the graduates to do well
as they ‘‘go out into the world
ina tomorrow that has now ar-
rived.”

Since 1961, the Davidson val-
edictorian and salutatorian have
not given speeches and have
had their positions in the exer:
cise reduced to the point where
they merely stand to be recog-
nized.

tn 1960 the last talks were

given by David Robinson, who
criticized the weaknesses of
the college, and by Dabney
Stuart, who gave a salutatory
which lasted less than a min-
ute and repeated a theme em-
phasized so much by Jesus:
“Love one another.”

Last year, even the com-
mencement speaker was cut
from the program to save time.
The only outside speaker this
year will be present for the
Sunday morning baccalaureate
service which preceeds the com-
mencement.

To cut the time still more, all
but two awards have been
switched to the annual Awards
Day, which is held each May
during assembly.

Due to the stipulations of the
givers, the William Banks Bible
Medal, given each year to the
member of the graduating class
“who has completed four years
of Bible with the highest dis-

tinction,’’ and the Algernon Syd-
ney Sullivan Award have re-
mained on the commencément
program.

The latter award consists of
two medallions presented each
year by the New York Southern
Society in memory of its found-
er. One goes to a person out-
side the student body’ and the
other to a member of the Sen-
ior Class. The awards recog-
nize “fine spiritual qualities
practically applied to daily liv-
ing.”

The college has further limi-
tations to guide in the selection
of the recipient of the awards.

The senior chosen each year
by the nominating committee of
the faculty is a student who has
done service which previously
has not been rewarded or recog

nized. The faculty recommends
seniors who fit this require-
ment; the committee then se-
lects the student it feels most
worthy of the award.

The committee itself, on the
announcement sent each year
to faculty members asking
for recommendations, states,
“These awards, as you know,
are made for unselfish serv-
ice beyond the call of duty
and for which the recipient
has received no _ recognition,
pecuniary or otherwise.”

The majority of time during
the commencement is, of course,
taken up with the .awarding of
degrees. This part is what sen-
iors have been waiting for dur-
ing four years of work at ‘‘one
of the South’s strongest and
most demanding institutions."
