PREPARATION

Coming events cast their shadows
before, says the old adage, and it is
true. Concrete evidence may be
found on the last page of this copy
of your paper. The next examina-
tion schedule a shadow which
covers a lot of ground and is fraught
with ppssibilities, both good and
bad. Twice a year comes the time
when the stately outline for written
examinations finds its way into stu-
dent hands, carrying with it a chal-
lenge and a call to duty, and it is a
puzzle as to the varied responses
which the schedule may arouse in
those whom it concerns.

1S

To some students it is merely a
reminder that term papers must be
rushed a little more than was plan-
ned, or that parallel work must be
drawn to a close. These men have
labored more or less consistently
throughout the year. Consequently,
in spite of its promise of grinding
work, the exam-schedule offers also
the promise of work completed, sat-
isfactorily completed, and the vision
of vacation. beyond, Another class
of men, inevitably present on every

. campus, is that to whom the an-
nouncement offers nothing better
than unpleasant memories of neg-
lected duties, of postponed work,
and the prospect of disappointment
at the end of the school year. Usual-
‘ly, it all gets back to the same old
“boning and grinding” late at nights
and most of the day’ just before
exam time.

No man approaches examination
period with eagerness and joy, but
there’ is all the difference in the
world between the two types men-
tioned above or between individuals
which you might pick out for your-
self. One goes in confidéntly with
his eyes rightly fixed on the sun-
shine beyond the shadow, while the
other must. grope along slowly
through the shadow, lacking the

mental vigor to weather the ordeal

‘i top-notch style: Exams have been

In the editorial columns of this
page last week appeared a ref-
erence to the poem “I Have A
Rendezvous With Death,” and
the authorship of this poem was
attributed to Joyce Kilmer. Al-

the author. The error was a
needless one, and due apology to
our readers is hereby extended.

time. It is a pity that so many
never think-of things like that until
the shadow falls directly upon them.
Then comes the regret, the wishing,
the struggle.

It is that job of preparation which

faces every man in college today,
which calls to him to watch the
shadows and be ready when they
fall. Life gives no printed schedule
about her times of testing and trial.
She ‘strikes when and where she
pleases, and spares no one, The law
of the survival of the fittest doesn’t
always hold true. Fates takes a hand
occasionally—but the fellow who
learned to prepare himself in days
of sunshine is pretty likely to be
perched on a high rock and doing
well when the shadows begin to fall
along the lowlands.
Whatever has gone before, don’t
throw in now. Get lined up by the
new schedule, and dig in for the
rest of the year. Chances are you'll
surprise yourself when the final
grades are turned in, and certainly
the lesson of: foresight, of timely
preparation, will be stored away for
future use,

SOPH DAY AGAIN

Freshmen will remember Soph
Day as long as they live, for it is
their day of, bondage and subjuga-
tion to the more powerful, or should
we important, sophomores.
Down the years comes the tradition
and the execution of Soph Day, and
we are in. hearty accord with it, as
now conducted on Davidson campus.
There should be one day, at least,
when all formality and dignity of
manner and dress can be shelved,
and when the whole student body
can engage in wholesome fun..

The day of extreme punishment
for the first vear men has passed
from all forward-looking colleges,
and the idea now in vogue is to
create a program for freshmen
which will be amusing and indica-
tive of the ever present “Soph Su-
premacy,” but which will inflict no
unreasonable or dangerous condi-
tions. Davidson’s Soph Day is well
within the bounds of safety and of
human consideration. Gone forever
are the days when painted “rats”
rushed into their dormitories to find
all water connections cut off, leav-
ing as the only alternative a plunge
into ‘the then present lake.

say

In the long run, the freshmen get
as much enjoyment out of the day
as anybody else, and so long as those
in charge of the activities for the
occasion maintain level heads, no
harm can result. May the clarion
cries of the time-callers long ring
out from the porch of old Georgia,
and may Soph Day hold to its place
in the list of local traditions.

MENTAL INDEPENDENCE

One of the most important things
that a man can acquire at college is
the ability to form his own opinions
on the more vital phases of life.
President Eliot of Harvard once
stated that part of the equipment
that a student should get from col-
lege was the habit of independent
thinking on books, prevailing cus-
toms, and current events. He
thought that the man who received
the highest benefit from a college
education was the one who had de-
veloped a mind capable of making
decisions without relying upon pop-
ular opinions.

If this is true, there are only a
very few students who are receiv-
ing one of the greatest advantages
offered at college. The student body
is influenced by. the opinions of a
small.number of men. These men,
who are the leaders of their classes,

Cosmic Chaos
By J. W. McCutchan

mands immediate action in regard to
disarmament. She demands that the
naval altercation between the United
States and Great Britain be tabled in
deference to this tatest matter. The
former Empire would cease to worry if
it were not for her misdeeds of the
past. She was the first to adopt
poisonous gases in field warfare, she
the first to openly declare solemn
treaties to be mere scraps of paper.
But all the “king’s horses and all the
king’s men can not lift Humpty
Dumpty up again.”

Miss Texas Guinan, night club hos-
tess par excellence, accused of being a
public nuisance, has been acquitted.
When on trial she frankly admitted
that she increased the enjoyment of
human life more by the distribution of
forbidden beverages, than by sitting
at home sewing. Would that Teddy
Roosevelt were here to admonish her.
It is fortunate that there is only one

have been, with very few’ except-
ions, the leaders. during their whole
college life. They form their. own
opinions on a subject, and the rest
of the students, who comprise the
bulk of the college, merely agree
with them, and either lack the ability
or the interest to think independ-
ently.

This is a vital question, because
college is merely a step in the pre-
paration for life. Thus, if a man
does not learn to think for himself
while he is in college, it is very pro-
bable that he -will go through life
relying on the opinions of others.

The majority of these people are
perfectly content to drift through
life, agreeing with the common con-
sensus of opinion. However, they
should realize the serious conse+
quences of such a stand, and should
make a conscious effort. to think in-
dependently and to agree with a
question not because it is the popu-
lar opinion but because it is their
own opinion after giving the matter
careful deliberation,

OLD OR NEW?

Are the old traditions and stand-
ards of conduct which have been
characteristic of Davidson for
many years breaking away? Are
those chivalric and courteous ideals
which distinguish the true gentle-
man from his less polished associates
heing replaced by codes of conduct
which lack all the finer qualities of
manhood? In years gone by, David-
son men established traditions which
have long been held sacred to their

sO

‘|memory, and considered the very

essence of the college. Once students
of the old school when meeting one
another on the campus, deemed it
courteous and the part of a gentle-
man to speak a kind, cheery word of
greeting, but now—vague rumors
are abroad that the practice is a nui-
sance. Has the new industrial era
so changed the country that the old
standards of common courtesy are
beginning to be swept away? Do we
now stress the conversation of
bodily energies to the extent of tear-
ing away -the old institutions as
regards conduct?

Not alone in this one particular
are conditions changing. No longer
does the one-time Wildcat Spirit

stress during athletic events. No
longer do the freshmen “horse” the
sophomores, and the sophs retaliate
as they once did. The love of the
old strife seems to have died. Is. it
the new. industrialism permeating
humanity even in the rudimentary
things of life? If this be the case,
if the passing of the old ideals and
the influx of the mew has engen-
dered. such a. condition;.. shall..awe
allow these revered traditions of
ours to be cast’ aside in faver of
such. narrow and _ self-centered
standards of conduct? aan

The New York Times, which has an
earning capacity of from five to ten
million dollars annually, has recently
had its capitalization raised to $26,000,-

“All the news that’s fit to print,” was
laughed at, but 78 years of experience
have proved its policy to be a good
one,

It has been suggested that all re-
tailers be required to pass an examina-
tion and secure a license, just as a pro-
fessional man, before selling to the
public. Investigations have shown that
before it was required to file in-
come tax returns, only one out of
every twenty-five kept books.
other twenty-four ran their businesses
by guesswork alone.

A new kind of amusement was in-
troduced last week in Pittsburgh. A

car barn and rode out to the end of
the line alone for a Saturday night
joy ride, merrily clanging the bell as
he rode.

According to statistics the United
States seems to be approaching a sat-
uration point in automobiles. Five
years ago the percentage of growth
was 23, but growth has steadily de-
creased, until last year cars increased
only five per cent. There were at the
last registration 23,127,315 cars and
trucks in the U. S. That ought to be

Miss Guinan, or race suicide would

Latest operatic news concerns one
of the youngest of its stars. Marion
Talley, whose phenomenal success
brought the world of music to her
feet, has declared that she will retire
at the early expiration of her contract.
It is reported that Miss Talley has
netted some three hundred thousand
dollars while appearing in grand opera.
Yet many of her friends of Kansas
City who financed her training are a
bit mystified. She intends to take up
agriculture in the Buckeye state. From
Il Travatore to milking cows—well, it
may be a Jack Dempsey retirement
and it may not.

Federal authorities in Canton, China,
turn machine guns on radical agitators
and kill one hundred of them. Twenty-
five years ago their heads would have
been placed on poles and paraded
through the streets. China is becom-
ing civilized. Like the Yellow Father
Tiber, a yellow “tide is arising in the
East to mingle with the Asiatic hordes.
India and China united will form a
great nation and a terrible one for the
rest of us.

Ten-year-old Merle Phemicie was-re-

legging. Tender of years, he made
the mistake of selling contraband to
the Sheriff and two deputies. He and
his father were immediately placed un-
der a large bond. Prohibition must be
enforced but perhaps even the strictest
law abider would hesitate at the
stringent punishment of a mere child.
Reform school should be the limit of
his disgrace, but his father and moth-
er should be taught how to correctly
rear the citizens of tomorrow.

When a thirty-five ton meteor fell
in South Africa, it brought back mem-
ories of former visitors from the out-
side cosmos. It is known by men of
science that meteors of this weight
must come from a source ‘outside the
earth’s solar system. By examining
them it is possible to gain an idea of
the composition and elements of other
worlds. One which fell in Dhurmsala,
India, was coated with ice in two
hours. Though the friction had heated
the outside of this meteor to approxi-
mately ten thousand degrees Centi-
grade, yet the inside of it was of a
temperature several hundred degrees
below zero. Probably man will never
know whence it came nor what force
caused its arrival.

THE NOBLE ART OF BLUFFING
A science professor, in an examination, gave a series of terms to be de-
fined. In the number, he included a meaningless, entirely fictitious word. The
word hé coined for the purpose was what might be termed “scientific-sound-
ing’ but was absolutely void of meaning. Out of t-venty-three students,
twenty-one defined the fictitious term, some few touching up their definition
with flowing words and knowledge gleaned elsewhere, That is the noble art

of bluffing!

But bluffing is a harmful art, you say. Perhaps.
Life itself is one long bluff. When you have to sit

Be nonchalant—light a Murad.

Bluff! Freeze an interested look on your face and play
Just like a little boy playing hookey from school. When your aunt

A great art, this bluffing. But it don’t always work. When the language
professor, for instance, calls on you and you read something that has already
been translated—and translated correctly—in that case, a whole box of Mu-

rads would be useless.

THE ROOM MATE
Joe College sez that his room-mate took a bath last Wednesday night.
When the chapel bell rang on Thursday morning, he got out of bed, grabbed
the morning paper and looked for the “full page of colored comics appearing

every Sunday.”

And

the young sophisticate spends a pleasant day wearing his clothes backward,
riding stick hobby-horses, crawling around, bowing to Sophs and other child-

Invariably, he will “pan” the very day itself—but will keep all

EBB TIDE

For cighteen years the Boston
Transcript has anually compiled the
enrollments of ninety representative
American colleges and universities and
presented its figures as a typically na-
national survey. They have been ac-
ceptable, inasmuch as the curve that
has been true for these institutions
would have been just as true for the
many smaller colleges left out. It
finds that there are today six times as
many students in these colleges as
were there thirty years ago. For the
decade between 1800 and 1000 the gain
was over 4,500 a year. For the next
decade that gain was nearly. 10,000 a
year, and it has touched 50,000 since
then. Lately there has been a steady
slowing up of this phenomenal in-
crease: has dropped to the lowest since
the saturation point will shortly be
reached.

The interesting point about these
figures is that this year the rate of in-
crease has dropped to the lewest since
the war. For the last five years the
per cent gain has been 6.5, 5.1, 4.7, 4.8,
and 3. The tendency has obviously
been a slowing up of of college regis-
tration. The gain last year over the
previous year was 13,800; this year it
is 9,000. The total enrollment in the
selected institutions is now 301,363.

It is in the freshman classes that the
figures best show conditions. Last fall
75,733 entered these ninety colleges and
universities as compared to 76,029 in
1927, a pér cent loss of 0.389. Through-
out the country half of the colleges re-
port small freshman increase, and half
small losses. The peak seems to have
been reached in the nuinber of incom-
ing freshmen. This may be due to a
number of causes. Such a tremendous
gain per year as happened in the first
years following the armistice in Eu-
rope could not possibly be maintained
permanently under the best of condi-
tions. In the West the farming situa-
tion has not been conducive to heavier
college registration. There has been
the development during this period of
the junior ‘college, which is not reck-
oned with in the figures above, and
which undoubtedly has drawn students
from the smaller Western institutions.
There has been the movement among
the endowed universities in the country
toward limitation of numbers, so as
deliberately to hold down the number
of students to the equipment and the
size of the faculty. ‘

Whatever has been the cause of the
halt in the upward college-enrollment
movement, the fact is established that
the American college is approaching a
stabilization of student attendance
which will permit of a stabilization of
everything else connected with its work
—teaching staff, courses, and building
equipment. This, of course, is wholly
to the advantage of the college. When
the great rush to the colleges began
at. the close of the war, the colleges
themselves were unprepared. ‘Their
faculties were distributed, owing to
enlistment and war work. Their new
faculty material had for the moment
fallen behind the demand. Their funds
had come to a standstill. Their physi-

cal equipment had’ been “standing~stilt-}

ry

They had to begin all over again. The
result for a time was close to chaos,
with finances in a bad way and more
students knocking at the door than
there was room for. The colleges
gradually caught up with the flood of
students, but it has been only lately
that some measure of comfort has
again found its way into their opera-
tion, and even now this is true only in
a comparative sense. The rush of new
students during this period has been
a healthy thing, but it will be a relief
to the colleges themselves to find that
it is now slowing down and that the
educational business is again approach-
ing normal. The new normal, how-
ever, will be at a higher level than be-
fore the war. And in general the
American college has risen to that new
and higher level in its operation—The
Yale Alumni Weekly.

Is this lessened acceleration to be
taken as merely accidental and tem-
porary, or is it the beginning of a per-
manent slowing up or a possible de-
cline? There are good reasons for be-
lieving that it may be more than tem-
porary. The slowing up has no special
cial geographical limits. In twenty-
two state there are actually fewer col-
lege and university students than in
the previous year, and these states are
scattered through every section of the
country from New England to the Pa-
cific Coast... .

The junior college has cut down to
some extent what would have been
larger increased in the four-year col-
leges. In a few years junior colleges
have increased.in number to more than
four hundred.

In the more distant future, large in-
creases in college and university at-
tendance are not in sight. Our much
smaller immigration brings a much
smaller number of prospective college
students. Our native rate of increase
is small... .

Our present birth rate is 21 per
thousand as against 19 per thousand
in France, and if the Southern States
with a high negro birth rate are ex-
cluded our rate is only 17 per thousand.

Certainly the growth of population
is much less than a few years ago, and
the growth of colleges is very likely to
fall off still more in the course of a
decade unless the values or other at-
tractions of college training shall come
to appeal still more widely than at
Present—Dr. A. L. Jones, Columbia
University.

Decrease in the numbers seeking ad-
mittance will come largely in the ranks
Of the intellectually inactive; the men
of valid interests will continue to seek
the college. , ,

To attribute. the decline in numbers
to the birth rate seem to stretch a
point. Most men are anxious that their
Sons attend college; if they have the
funds, they will send them. Lessen-_
ing of the material Prosperity of the
country, at least in the ranks of the
middle classes, and a growing con-
viction that college education is neither
the sure way to succeed nor the
Privilege_of-every white male individ-
ual of the country, seem almost equally
important—The Dy Princetonian.:
