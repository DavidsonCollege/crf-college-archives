Blacks Ask End Of Ciemson’s STEP

The president of the Student League for Black
Identity at Clemson University asked last week for an
end to tutoring of black children in the surrounding
community. ;

Speaking for his organization, the president said
that whites’ tutoring black children does nothing for
black identity and pride while merely teaching mechan-
ics like grammar and arithmetic.

Students for Educational Aid are “doing more
harm than good,” said the president. “Blacks would
like to see the program stopped because what SEA
is really doing is to grow these black children up to

e white.”

Michigan Regents Restrict Military Research

The Board of Regents of the University of Michi-
gan has established a set of guidelines for classified
research to be done at the university.

The guidelines include automatic rejection of con-
tracts for research which is aimed at destroying or
incapacitating human beings, contracts ,under which
the university would be unable to reveal the subject
of the research for confidential discussion by the
faculty. contracts which would deny the university
the right to reveal the existence of the research or
the idenity of the contractor, and contracts which
fail to either enhance the research capabilities of the
researcher or contribute significantly to the advance-
ment of knowledge.

Northside Elementary School?

“If we need to, we'll have to sit-in. We’ll just sit
down and do nothing,” dectares Andy Schoultz, a
sixth grader at Northside Elementary School in Ann
Arbor, Mich. ‘

Northside Elementary Scheul!?

In an action similar to those at many universities
over decisions on tenure, a group of concerned fifth
and sixth graders tas confronted Ann Arbor Superin-
tendent of Public Schools Scott Westerman and de-
manded reinstatement of a teacher who was recently
demoted.

The leaders of the movement. who call themselves
the Kids Committed for Mister Silvian (KCMS), mobil-
ized recently when they learned that their teacher.
Joseph Siivian, had been demoted from his regular
teaching position to full-time substitute.

“He helps us, he talks to us.” says Lynn Erlich.
one of the leaders of the KCMS and the daughter of a
University of Michigan Social Work School professor.
“His ‘entire idea of education is getting cut off. Mr.
Silvian needs a chance.”

Competing Newspaper Investigated

A newspaper at Vanderbilt University which was
set to counter the regular newspaper. the Hustler, is
coming under investigation by the Vanderbilt student
government.

The new newspaper, the Versus, was chartered
as, a corporation in the state of Tennessee by three
Nashville citizens and is being opetated by sophomore
Mike Frank.

According to Hofstra University Chronicle, their
student newspaper, the Hustler was taken over last
fall by a small, radical group which used the editorial
page to endorse black comedian Dick Gregory for
President.

The Versus, which advocates a. university admin-
istration line, including the Vanderbilt administra-
tion’s emphasis on working within the existing frame-
work, is under attack for not being correctly register-

“It will of course be incon-
venient to move out for a
week, but we will be doing
everything we can to make
it easy as possible on those
involved,” Jewett said.

According to Jewett, each
fraternity house will host
girls in proportion to the
numifer of members who
have traveled to Randolph
Macon. ‘‘We will inform the
girls as to class schedules
and as to which classes they
are welcome to attend,” he
said.

Jewett noted that there
will be a curfew, probably
midnight on weeknights, with
the girls being checked in by
members of the Residence
Hall Council or by special
seniors designated by Ran.
dolph-Macon.

“The temporary value of
having girls on the campus
for a week is fairly obvious,”
Jewett said. “But this week
can also give us an oppor-
tunity to try a possible future
course, that of co-education.”

SOUTHERN FOLK FESTIVAL
Entire ensemble joins for opening number.

Country Troupe Captures Spirit

of its musical expressions
which make the South. the
greatest source of folk music
in America.

For two and a half hours
they fascinated their audience
and probed for the thing that
makes u& all tick. . . . love.
This unusualy warm group
of entertainers hit their’ tar-
get and all appreciated their
talents as they received a
standing ovation at the com
pletion of their program.

The troupe consists of sev-
eral groups well-known na-
tionally, but ironically ob-
scure in the South. The pro-
gram began with a “clog”
as the Blue Ridge Mountain
Dancers displayed their ta-
lent. The dancers are natives
of North Carolina and are
champion cloggers.

The Rev. Pearly Brown,
blind since birth. was then

singer and guitarist then

panied himself on the guitar.
words slowly came forth.

With all the love of man-

kind that the Reverend pos-
sessed, he sang out a hope of
the future. *. . . Peace will
prevail... .”°

The audience returned the
same love that he gave to
them as they gave him a
standing ovation.

Elizabeth Cotton then per-
formed a song which she
had written over 65 years
ago and.since then has be-
come nationally famous. At
only 10 years of age she
wrote “Freight Train’ and
ever since has been perform.
ing it in front of appreciative
audiences.

With her sqeaky elderly
voice and her unusual guitar
style she fascinated the au-
dience. When asked why she
played that way (she plays
left-handed and upside-down)

Geyer To Speak
At Baccalaureate

Dr. Alan Geyer, editor of
“The Christian Century”
Journal, will be Davidson
College’s baccalaurate speak-
er June 8.

The publication has becn
called ‘the nation's most in-
fluential religious journal of
news and opinion.”

Dr. Geyer is the author of
“Piety and Politics’ (John
Knox Press, 1963) and cv.
author and editor of “The
Maze of Peace’ (Friendship
Press, 1969)

Prior to assuming his pre-
sent position, he was Direc-
tor of International Relations
for the United Church of
Christ. From 1960 to 1965 he
was chairman of the depart-
ment of political science at
Mary Baldwin College.
Staunton, Va.

Dr. Geyer is a Phi' Beta
Kappa graduate of Ohio Wes-
leyan University. He receiv-
ed an S. T. B. degree from
Boston University School of
Theology. and in 1961 receiv-
ed a Ph. D. from the Grad-
uate School of Boston Univer-
sity.

An ordained minister, he
has served pastorates in
Cambridge. Mass., and New-

ark, N. J. “He has long been
involved in movements for
racial justice and urban re-
construction.”- according to
“The Christian Century.”

He has served in several
capacities with the National
Council of Churches, and
numerous religious and pro-
fessional organizations.

The baccalaurate services
will be at 11 a. m. in the Dav-
iason College Presbyterian
Church. Adrhission will ve
by ticket only.

To fit the Davidson atmos-
phere it was inevitable that
the words ‘Momma _ don't
‘low no card-playing here’
were retorted with irony by
Fred Stovall. a blues singer
from the Mississippi Delta
area,

With “cat hat’ and khaki
pants he plucked from his
all metal guitar that immor-
tal spiritual ‘“‘Down by the
Riverside."

The whole troop was re-
ceived so well that the Union
asked them to stay and pre-
sent two more concerts.
These people of the South. of
the mountains and the low-
lands, the black and’ the
white, have woven a poetic
history in song.

The music of these South-
ern musicians has been a
story of defeat and difficul-
ties. of earthly joys and
heavenly hopes, and of sud-
den death and inward dignity.
These same people try to
live the message they preach.

We “are concerned with
building a South in which
black people and while peo-
ple can live together in m:-
tual respect.”

They received the respect.
the admonition, and the en-
thusiasm of all they came in
contact with during their two
day stay.

In these Southern folk art-
ists, the hope of peace, unity.
and love prevailed to show
the rich heritage of the ‘red
clay America.”
