STUDENT OPINION VARIES
Administration--Is It Hypocritical?

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Weiter

Student opinion of the fac-
ulty and administration of
Davidson runs the gamut
from strong disapproval to
general satisfaction. But even
the expressions of satisfac-
tion are qualified.

Several students interview-
ed recently felt that the ad-
ministration was being hypo-
critical when it said that it
was operating in the  stu-
dents’ interest.

They criticized the drink-
ing rules and other faculty
and administration regula-
tions as being anachronistic,
urirealistic and detrimental to
the development of the stu-
dents.

But other students did not
take such a dim view of the

administration. They agreed
that the administration was
dragging its feet on some is-
sues, but they did not attrib
ute it to hypocrisy.

“Rules restrict the  stu-
dent's ability to develop into
a whole man,"’ said one of
the critical students, John
Barber. ‘Davidson, as a lib-
eral arts college, should be
concerned with teaching the
students how to make intelli-
gent and responsible deci-
sions. However, regulations
such as the drinking rules do
not allow them to do so."’

The critical students ex-
pressed the hope that under
the new student body consti-
tution and the forthcoming
regulations from the Com-
mittee on Rules and Punish-
ment (CRAP), the situation

would be changed.

This group also illustrated
the hypocrisy of the adminis-
tration by pointing out incon
sistencies between the pur-
pose of the college as stated
in the general catalogue and
the actions taken by the ad
ministration.

“How can the college say
it has a Christian commit-
ment when it requires two
years of ROTC?" asked Cary
Tucker. Noting the statement
that says, ‘‘Davidson is dedi-
cated in the quest for truth,"’
he said. ‘‘Davidson, as con
ceived by the faculty and ad
ministration, is dedicated to
producing students with high
grade-point averages."’

The statement which drew
the most criticism was the
one saying, ‘‘The selection of

students is based upon merit
rather than upon economic
status, social standing or eth-
nic background.”

“While it might be true
that few Negroes apply.”
said Bob McKellar, “‘it is al-
so true that the college does
not actively recruit Negroes
and members of other mi-
nority groups. As a conse
quence, they go to Harvard
or Yale or some other school
where they are encouraged
to come.

“This is inconsistent with
Davidson's claim that it is a
liberal arts college, for the
education of Negroes is of the
greatest importance today.
If Davidson wants to be in
the forefront of education.
then it had best stop drag

Bert Mason’s Singing Revolution
Provides Hungry d Spontaneity

A REVIEW
By DICK ANDERSON
Staff Writer
Revolution is the theme of
all the posters about Burt
Mason’s appearance at the
Hungry d this week. and it
is revolution that is inherent
in Mason's performance.
Wednesday night Mason
appeared with a close friend,
Bruce Farwell. When the two
appear together. Mason's
revolution is most evident.
“Bruce and I went through
a lot together when we were

in the Vilage (Greenwich
Village)."" Mason said. He
and Farwell have no barriers
between them. despite the
fact that Farwell is white and
Mason is a Negro.

“Bruce is a beautiful cat.
he really is,"’ Mason said.

Another part of Mason's
revolution is his stage pre
sentation. He sings much the
same songs in the same man-
her that other folk singers
do, but in his performance
there is a refreshing element
of spontaneity other perform-

ers lack.

“If anyone comes kere to
see me and doesn't -realize
that I'm up there to have
fun, I think he’s missing out
on the whole thing,’’ Mason
said.

The Wednesday night show
al the Hungry d was divided
into three pazts. During the
first period Mason sang, fol-
lowed by a solo period by
Farwell and. ending in sev-
eral duets.

During the first two parts
there was a certain lack of

Examines

Technology

Whenever technology changes, social and
cultural patterns must change proportionately,
Dr. Robert Montgomery told the student body
in assembly Tuesday.

Montgomery, professor emeritus of economics
at the University of Texas, pointed out that
science and technology have forced cultural
upheaval with the work of Einstein and the
Curies.

“Three-fourths of all the books that have
ever been written were written in my _ life-
time,” the gray-haired economist said. ‘‘Ninety
per cent of all the scientists who ever lived are

Montgomery described his
speciality as the study of
power. He used the relative
strengths of the first atomic
bomb and current thermonu.
clear devices as an example
of how potential power has in-
creased in the last 20 years.
Current. bombs are 25,000
times more powerful than the
Hiroshima bomb.

Dr, Ernest F. Patterson,
economics professor and a
former student of Montgom-
ery’'s who introduced him,

said that there are some men.

who deserve one cheer and
some two cheers from man-
kind, but ‘‘Dr. Boh deserves
three cheers for trying to sub-
vert the minds of youth for
60 years.”

Montgomery drew various
parallels with his boyhood in
rural west Texas. He said

that it now takes him less
time to go from Dallas to
Los Angeles than it did to get
the mail when he was young.

Montgomery describes ‘upheaval.’

Cousar, Williams
To Chair Courts

Three juniors and a sopho.
more were elected to posts
in the student judiciary this
week.

Bud Cousar was elected
chairman of the new Court
of Appeals while two other
juniors, Bill Williams and
Tom Baker, were elected
chairman and vice-chairman
of the Honor Court.

Sophomore Ken Crews was
elected Honor Court record-
er,

The appeals court met
briefly Tuesday night to take
the oath of office, elect a
chairman and appoint a 3-
man committee to draw up

a new trial procedure. The
court also decided to continue
the present trial procedure
until a new one is drawn up.

Sophomores Bob Dunham
and Franklin Anderson and
junior John Passmore were
appointed to the committee
by Cousar.

As chairman of the court,
Cousar will have to sign all
authorizations for search of
student rooms or vehicles,
except those signed by the
dean of students, and admin-
ister the oath of office, in ad-
dition to his constitutional
duties of heading the court
and being president of a con-
stitutional convention.

animation among the rather
sparse audience, but by the
end of the performance the
audience was wholly with the
performers.

Singing old spirituals and
modern folk rock. ‘cracking
obviously spontaneous puns,
the pair received an encore
from an audience which
wanted still more.

Mason is not a glib per
former. Several times during
his performance he stopped
to search for just the word
he wanted, his hands clawing
at the air as though he might
pull the word from the air.

“Of course I pay atention
to the audience."’ Mason said.
“I'm here to have fun with
the audience, and if they're
not responding we both miss
out on something.”

““T have fun; that's what
the whole thing's about,"’ he
added.

“Just 4 person, that’s all I
am, just a person."

Several of the more satis
fied students, however. point-
ed to the Blue Sky Curricu-
lum as evidence that the fac-
ulty and administration does
care about the students.

“I think the apathy of the
student body is largely re
sponsible,”’ said Jim Yandle.
“There is a liberal segment
of ‘the faculty that is willing
to give the students more
freedom and responsibility.
There is a conservative ele.
ment which feels that the stu.
dents have enough freedom
already.

“But there is also a group
which is waiting for some

demonstration of interest.

from the student body. 1 feel
that this segment of the fac.
ulty would advocate more
changes around here if they
saw that. the..student body
was willing and interested in
taking on the responsibility
of more freedom.”

‘I don't think that the ad
ministration or the faculty is
trying to suppress the stu
dents," said John Riggs.
“While they have been slow
in making changes, progress
has been made. If anything,
you could accuse them of
overcautiousness, which I
think comes from a desire to
do the right. thing.”

‘All ‘in all. the administra
tion has moved as fast as it
can; however, it might moye

The Student. Council also
received some. criticism.
Jimmy Milholland said. ‘‘The
council is doing a fine job in
doing what it can do. How
ever, what it can do is not
very much.”

Students differed again. as

‘SOME PEOPLE MUST THINK I'M KIND OF BATTY’
Miss Copeland displays some of her curious wares.

Unusual Ware To Be Found
In Davidson Curiosity Shop

By DANNY COLTRANE
Staff Writer

Whether looking for an addition to
his room decor or an unusual gift, the

‘Davidson student may find it in Miss

Mary Copeland's Curiosity Shop on
Main Street.

Miss Copeland has operated ‘the
Jungle,” as Davidson students nick-
named her father’s general merchan-
dise store, since his death in. 1963. and
last September she began selling
antiques and her own craft work as
well,

Her curiosity shop is filled with her
restored antiques, antiqued reproduc.
tions and decoupaged bottles, boxes and
wall plaques.

She described the unusual candle
holder which a student requested her
to make for his girlfriend. ‘The candle
sat on a roller skate, and | attached two
burned out radio tubes and hung orange
and black paint can lids from the
holder, It took me forever to make it.”

“T just do whatever comes to me;
some people must think I’m kind of

batty,” she laughed.

She recalled the time she tried to mix
perfume from the contents of old bottles
obtained from a pharmacist.

“1 used a cologne recipe from the
back of a 159-year-old cookbook, but
then I added some extra ingredients of
my own. This place smelled awful for a
week.”

A wigless mannikin salvaged from the
dress shop which she once operated now
displays a pair of 19th century spec-
tacles, a ring on its nose, and a neck-
lace made from beer can pop tops.

Miss Copeland explained that many
of the antiques which she sells come
from the attic of her family home,
which is over a hundred years old. She
collects antiques from other local
sources. ‘‘l don’t ever ask people for
them.” she said. “They have to ask me.”

Among these relics may be found a
sign from the Carolina Inn. a Model’:
“T” carburetor, photographs of the col-
lege campus from over fifty years ago,
and Miss Copeland’s personal collection
of antique medicine and liquor bottles.
