340 Freshmen Parents
Will Register Tomorrow

Under the direction of the Freshman Council, the Class of '63 will entertain
over 340 parents and relatives during Freshman Parents’ Day tomorrow.

According to Freshman
Counselor Bill Whitesell, this
group represents the . Jargest
percentage of parents ever to
visit the campus in the five
year history of Freshman Pa-
rents’ Day. Says Whitesell: “We
have’ received replies from the
-parents of 201 freshmen of
which 148 were positive. Less

’ than one-fourth who have been
heard from did not accept.

“Among the 340 scheduled to
have lunch here Saturday are
persons from as far away as
Houston. Texas.”

der the leadership of recently-
elected President Alec Morgan,

MEET THE FACULTY
In commenting on the oppor-
tunities afforded freshmen as
well-as parents by. Freshman

Parents’ Day, Morgan stressed
the particular point of oppor-
tunities to meet the faculty: “I
urge all freshmen to come
themselves and to bring their
parents to the coffee immedi-
ately following the Lehigh
game. This is a good chance
for the parents to meet their
son’s professors and to observe
first-hand some of the differ-
ences between high school and
college.”

Twenty-five freshmen have
been appointed as guides for
campus touring groups Satur-
day. The guides, headed and or-
ganized by Tom Ross are Bill
Boyd, George Sledge, Claud
Perry, Tom Wright.
Nichols, Sam White, Richard
Lowery. John Cameron, Bob

Extension Of Tour
Granted To Adams

Lt. Col. William L. Adams
has been granted a year’s ex-
tension in his tour of duty as
PMS&T here. His stay at David-
son originally scheduled to end
next summer, has been extend-
ed to the summer of 1961.

“I'm very happy with the ex-
tension,” Col. Adams said. He
explained that he had not ap-
plied for the additional year.
He was asked to remain at Da-
vidson by the Army.

“I’m a little reluctant to ask
the Army for anything,” Adams
smiled, “but I’m very delighted
that things worked out as they
did.”

Adams said that, as the situ-
Neil|ation stands now, he will be

Mr. James Harris, chairman
of the board, will preside over

was organized in 1956.

“Of the many Jimitations of
the cut system there is one
definitely weak, unnecessary
ruling which pertains to a rel-
atively large gtoup of the stu-
dent body, sometimes without
their knowing: This is the rul-
ing that will not allow an ath-
lete to cut more than his one
probationary cut without hav-
ing to forfeit his right to go on
athletic trips. .

“By realizing the benefits of
cutting a class it can be seen
that this ruling does not help
the athlete but can often times
make things harder for him (as
if they are not hard enough
already).

“Therefore what conclusion
is an athlete supposed to make
concerning the system, except
that it is not designed for his
own benefit but for some oth-
er reason (possibly to keep
some professors from the em-
barrassment of an _ empty

DABNEY STUART

“I agree essentially with the
statements made by Dean John-
ston in the November sixth is-
sue of the DAVIDSONIAN.

“A student should be faced
with the responsibilty a free
cut system would place upon
him. Whether or not the stu-
dent is “mature™ enough to
handle the situation seems to
me secondary. Few students
are so mature when they en-
ter college, but placing respon-
sibility upon a man is some-
times the best way to teach him
to cope with it.

“I suggest that those who say
a free cut system “won't work”
really mean that it isn’t com-
mensurate with their own
methods. The “work” such a.
system should do, I think, is to
confront men with the fact of
responsibility. How they react
to this is their own business,

wording what'is already in our
power would not really prove
anything.

“Further, some of us actual-
ly prefer to use our cuts around
the holidays, and the recom-
mended changes would circum-
scribe rather than advance the
consequences of our taking off
two or three days early.

“Those of us who live so far
away that we can only get home
twice a year or less would pre-
fer the present system, I feel,
which only gives double cuts
—rather than setting up a cam-
pusing situation as the DAVID-
SONIAN recommendations pro-
pose.

“This has been a carefui sur-
vey by our paper, but I do not
think (1) that it will improve
upon the present situation, but
that rather, (2) it will make it
harder for us to cut before holi-
days.”
