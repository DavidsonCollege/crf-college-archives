Rawson |

Playing a fast doubleheader with Greens-
boro and Cornelius Highs, Friday night, the
Davidson Freshmen auspiciously opened the
Wildcat basketball schedule for 1924. Pre-
senting a bewildering combination of of-
fensive and defensive team-work, Coach
Rawson's men smothered the strong Greens-
boro five to the merry tune of 62-18, while
the formidable Cornelius quintet bowed to
the second team to the score of 29-27.

In the Greensboro game, the result was
never in doubt. After the first few minutes
Coach Rawson's Kittens began playing with
clocklike precision. The passing was almost |
perfect; apparently, when Anderson,
gins and Hewlett secured possession of the
ball the opposing guards were helpless, while
the defensive work was fully as admirable.

The whole team featured. Time and again
Hewlett dribbled the whole length of the
court with ease and made his basket. His
speed dazzled the high school guards. Twen-

ty-two points show his grand total for the!

game. .

Anderson starred with seemingly impos-
sible shots from directly under the basket,
each of which brought a broadside of ap-
plause from the fans.

Hudgins played an consistent game
throughout. He accounted for 10 points in
spite of his lanky rival; and .more remark-
able still, the Greensboro center was unable
to score during the whole game.

No one outplayed Sapp. His long shots
thrilled the spectators while his guarding
was almost impenctrable.

As standing guard, Simpson played
superb game. The Greensboro forwards
just could not get by, through, or over, him. |
Repeatedly, after one of them had made a
bad shot, he recovered the ball single-handed
and passed it out of the danger zone.

Greensboro had no stars. The whole
team played hard but it was hopelessly out-
classed. They made only
during the game.

It is more than mere dope that says the
Wildkittens have the strongest Freshman
team in the State. Incidentally, as this star
quintet represents West Virginia, Tennessee,

Strength of Convictions

Is A. A. Walker’s Theme

Says He Would Rat Rather See Men
With Wrong Convictions Than

\ With None

A, A. Walker, financial agent
Queens College, was the speaker at the
service last Sunday afternoon, His impres-
sive address was exceptionally well delivered
after an especially good song service. The
singing was led by Ted Jones, with Albert
Hillhouse leading in prayer.

Mr. Walkter began his address by refer-
ring to the Billy Sunday services now being
held in Charlotte and especially the college
j service of last Friday. He said that that was
the most impressive service of the meetings
thus far held. Then he went straight into
his discussion by stating that men are not
saved by the manipulation of man, by edu-
cation or skill, by might or power of man,
but by God's power.

Rev.

“It doesn’t make any difference what
power there is,” he said, “there is always
needed “SOme conveyor to carry it to’ the

thing that will use it. Likewise, there must
be some means whereby the power of God
can go into the human heart. Some call this
faith. Billy Sunday would call it love. I
try to think of it from one standpoint—con-
viction, for the power of God comes to the
human heart through its convictions.”

He stated that there is no distinction he-
tween the attitude the human heart be-
lieving in God and reading the Bible. The
function of the Holy Spirit is to persuade
men, which is really a conviction, It is the
lavenue by which the Holy Spirit enters the
|human heart and transforms man, Convic-
tion sets the standard of right and wrong
and enables one to draw the line between
them.

“The great function of the evangelist is

of

not to tell us of theology,” he said. “The
great function of the evangelist is to so
present matters that men heretofore with-

out convictions will be able to decide things
for themselves.”

He divided man into four

Alpha Phi Epsilon Proposes Ghanves

In Operation of Literary Societies

At a recent meeting’ of the Gamma Chap-
ter of Alpha Phi Epsilon an open discussion
of the work done in the four literary socie-
ties was led by Prof. F. L. Dendy. The
purpose of this discussion was to get clearly
before the minds of the members just what
are the aims of literary society work; then
to try to ascertain to what extent these aims
are being accomplished, and to,suggest some
workable plan to make the work more effi-
cient.

Right along with improvement in the art
of speaking, it was seen, should be the aim
of securing a good working knowledge of
parliamentary procedure.

A committee appointed by the president,
composed of Prof. C. K. Brown, chairinan,
Prof. F. L. Dendy, and one man from each
of the societies, has considertu’ <fie' acatecr:

2. To provide better opportunity tor prac-

One of the requirements for membership
