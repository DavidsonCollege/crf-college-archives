PAGE FOUR
PER STUDENT

For a rent of approximately twenty dollars per
semester per student, it will be possible for Davidson’s
twelve Greek letter fraternities to move into new single-

unit houses.

Mr. D. Grier Martin, Treas-
urer of the College, said that
this single unit house would
have a large living room, din-
ing room, unfinished basement,
patio, kitchen, and house-moth-
er’s quarters.

The floor space.in this sin-
gle-unit house will be over twice
as great as the combined floor
space of the present fraternity
house and the average boarding
house.

As an alternative plan, a du-
plex housing arrangement
would cost approximately
thirty-three dollars a semester
in the form of a fraternity rent-
al fee.

The duplex arrangement is a
plan whereby two houses are
joined together by a common
Kitchen and _ house-mother’s
quarter. These separate the
other rooms of the two houses.

Martin explained that the un-
finished basement would be
constructed with a concrete
floor and walls. It would be
suitable for television, ping-
pong, and games. He said that
it would be up to each fraterni-
ty to finish and decorate the
basement (as with wood panel-
ling) if they wished.

In explaining the cost of the
proposed system, Martin said,
“there has been some confus-
ion as to what this rent repre-
sents.” In short, the rent repre-
sents a net return of less than
5% on the college's investment
of approximately $360,000.

He emphasized that the col-
lege is making an investment
of its endowment funds. and
not a loan to the fraternities.

In, addition the college will
use more than $50,000 of funds
given to the College on which

fraternities.

In clearing up this question,
Mr. Martin explained that the
college has a nine million dol-
lar endowment fund which it
invests in various stocks and
bonds. Part of this endowment
would be invested in the new
court instead of in stocks and
bonds.

The College will have to real-
ize the same net earnings from
this investment as it does from
its others. To receive a net of
almost 5%, the rent must bring
in 8% because the college will
have to provide for deprecia-
ation, insurance, maintenance,
and other expenses.

The same arrangement ap-
plies to the present fraternity
houses. But since the initial in-
vestment was very low relative
to the new court, the rent on
the present houses is therefore
much lower.

The present houses were
built in 1928 at a cost of $5,000
each.

Martin went on to explain
that under the new system, it
might be possible to have each
member of a fraternity pay a
semester fraternity housing fee,
instead of having the fraterni-
ty as a whole pay the rent.

This method would. put the
burden on each individual, and
therefore would not penalize the
smaller fraternities.

The entire program is of
course subject to the approval
of the Trustees of the College
who will meet at. Davidson on
May 16th.

Martin stated that if any
questions _ still remain, he
would be glad to try to answer
them: at the open forum on

no charge will be made to the]the Union Ballroom.

| Court Effort

Shows Faith

By BOBBY LIVINGSTON
Davidsonian Feature Writer
As one of the four men primarily responsible for
the proposed fraternity court said, this effort “is cer-
tainly a tangible expression of the faith of the College
in the Davidson fraternity system.”

These men, Dr. W. G. McGa-
vock, Mr. D. Grier Martin,
Dean Samuel Spencer, and Dr.
Chalmers Davidson, all gradu-
ated from Davidson in the early
depression era.

Then only 50% of the student
body was in a fraternity, and
fraternities averaged 35-40 men
as opposed to 55-60 today.

Two general problems have
promoted the consideration of
a new court. They are a gen-
erally unsatisfactory eating and
social relationship and the
greatly increased size of the
fraternities, along with a pro-
posed increased enrollment.

The new court is also a logi-
cal step to follow the new
church, the union, the gym, and
the dormitory improvement.

Of the two suggested loca-
tions for the new court, the
two ridges running parallel to
the road behind Belk have been
selected as the tentative loca-

In the past separate houses of
the old court have been rented

the fraternities move to the

be to increase the number of

The other plan would call for
each fraternity member to pay
a “fraternity housing fee”
which would be about $20.00 a
semester for the single units,
or $16.50 for the duplex units.

Disadvantages of the single

POLL NOT STRESSED

LaFar And Smyth

) Speak To Trustees

Dan LaFar and Ross Smyth appeared before the
Trustees’ presidential nominating committee during its

meeting at the Commercial
on Friday, April 19.

As student representatives,
they voiced opinion in the elec-
tion of Dr. Cunninghant’s suc-
cessor. LaFar and Smyth gave
no prepared statement, but
made themselves open for ques-
tioning by members of the com-
mittee.

LaFar reports that the com-
mittee is considering personali-
ties for the position, although
it has not definitely decided on
the type of man needed.

Since no change in the basic
religious policy of Davidson is
anticipated, the question of
clergyman versus non-clergy-
man for president was not
emphasized.

Cadre To Lose
Five Key Men

Five key men in the David-
son ROTC department have re-
ceived new assignments and
will leave the college during
the summer months.

Lt. Col. John D. Sapp, Profes-
sor of Military Science and
Tactics, has been assigned. to
a-post in’ Germany. His replace-
ment is Lt. Col. William L.
Adams who will arrive here in
July.

Major Lee R. Brown was
transferred to Fort Jackson,
South Carolina and Capt. Ed-
win Ven Keuren, Jr., was as-
signed to Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
Lt. Thomas V. Brooks will re-
place Capt. Van Keuren.

MSGT. Louis H. Penley and
MSGT John P. Butts are leav-
ing Davidson but their new as-
signments have not been re-
ceived.

"53. Valedictorian
Wins ‘Big Money’

Larry Dagenhart, Valedicto-
rian of the Class of '53, won
$6700 on the quiz program Tic
Tac Dough on Monday. He de-
feated all challengers for five
days in answering questions on
varied categories.

A student at New York Uni-
versity Law School, Dagenhart
will also be Comment Editor
of the Law Review next year.
The Review is a professional
publication edited by students
and published monthly.

At Davidson Dagenhart, was
vice-president of Kappa Sigma,
vice-president of the student
body, and a member of Phi Beta
Kappa and Omicron Delta Kap-
pa honorary fraternities.

The recent poll by the David-
sonian was not stressed due
to a lack of serious interest on
the part of students in the poll.

The committee probably will
not have its function compiet-
ed by the May meeting of the
trustees. As one member said,
“This job is almost bigger than
we are; it: will require much
time.”

Composing the committee are
Mr. D. R. LaFar, chairman, Dr.
Jas. A. Jones, Dr. J. McDowell
Richards, Mr. Spencer Love,

and Rev. Fred Stair.

Blood Donors
Receive Cuts

IFC and the ROTC Depart-
ment will conduct the spring
blood drive Monday and Tues-
day, April 29-30, from 11 a.m.,
to 5 p.m. in Johnston Gym-
nasium.

Students giving blood will re-
ceive a free P.T. cut. ROTC ca-
dets, in addition, will be ex-
cused from drill on April 30,
May 7, and May 14, provided
they have attended drill April
16 and 23.

Anyone meeting all the re-
quirements but not physically
qualified, as determined by a
physician, will be eligible for
the cuts.

IFC will again sponsor a con-
test between fraternities, with
the fraternity having the high-
est participation receiving a
plaque. ATO won last fall's
drive with 100 per cent par-
ticipation.

All blood is distributed free
by the Red Cross, but hospitals
charge a service fee of seven
to fifteen dollars.

A credit card, given to every
donor, entitles him to free
blood whenever he or his
family may need it.

Stevens Elected
By Camera Club

At the April 17 meeting of
