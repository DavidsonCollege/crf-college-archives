- WILDCAT TRACKS

Following Davidson’s
“MEN OF MIGHT”
Along the Athletic Trail

By Zeb Long, Jr.

When the Wildcat and the Mule mix—
sounds. mighty good, doesn’t it? David-
son men all over the South and hundreds
of other supporters will be pulling for the
old Red and Black team as they have
never pulled before, when Monk takes
his eleven up West Point way in the fall
of ’29. And there is no doubt that it
will take all the support that can be
given if the Cats make a good showing.
Can Monk Younger and Tex Tilson’ do
it? Give them good freshman material
next fall, and then watch those Wildcats
go in ’20. :

‘
=

Davis-Elkins, a small Presbyterian in-
stitution in West Virginia has been giving
the Army a hard game for the last three |
or four years. Now, Davidson will get
her chance to pull-a Bo McMillan stunt.
Certainly the Wildcats deserve this
chance. for national recognition, because
no small team in the country has made
a more enviable record in the last three
years than have these same fighting Wild-
cats.

The diamond stars will be idle until
Saturday when a contest is on deck at
Concord with the Guilford Quakers, who
earlier in the season bowed to the Wild-
cats by the score of 6 to 0. “Doc” Kugler
will more than likely be Monk’s choice to
make it two straight over Pat Craw-
ford’s bunch. Old Man Jupe Pluvius de-
‘creed that the Lenoir-Rhyne game should
be put off by rain.

This column prophesied a win over
Duke, but it was not.so ordered, apparent-
ly. The Cats’ had every chance in the
world to win that game, but base knocks
simply were not to be had when the time
came, Jenkins pitched a heady game and
came out of the holes nicely, but he was
matched by McInnis, who, with batting
support, would have won hands down. A
real pinch-hitter would be worth about a
million iron men around this place. For
the spectators, the contest was a thriller.
Hal Johnson further proved his all-state
quality by sterling outfield work.

John Currie’s work against the South
Carolina Gamecocks Saturday was in-
dicative of the whole team’s showing.
His time of 9.9 on the 100 was the best
of the year, and seems to indicate that he
will be ready to lead his crew at the-big
showdown in Greensboro this week-end.
Davidson stands the best chance in the

State meet this time that she has had for
a long while. ;

A new college record in the high
hurdles was set by the flying feet of the
sophomore flash, Whittle. He got over
them to the tune of 15.5, clipping a tenth
of a second off the time set by Huie in
1901. This boy, along with Currie, is go-
ing to show the South some real form next
spring.

Once again, the eyes of the campus are
focused upon Captain Dick Car and his
fellow netmen. They served Furman a
nice licking, 5-1, Saturday, and look good
to win final honors in. the Carolina tourna-
ment soon to be completed at Chapel Hill.
This ought to be Roddey’s year in the
singles, and everybody knows what Carr
and Roddey ¢an do in the doubles.

The coming of Capt. N. G. Pritchett to
Davidson as athletic instructor should
mean a great deal to the school, and his
reputation at Woodbury Prep serves as a
splendid introduction to all Davidson men,
He will not take part in the actual coach-
ing duties of Monk and Tex, but will. care
for most of the business end of the sit-

uation.

The menagerie at Dr. Charlie's house is
steadily growing. The Jynior class wild-

night, and it was hinted ‘that a real wild-

With U. S. M

Monk Y s Football Eleven to
Play Military Academy in
October, 1929

The news that the Davidson Wildcats
will meet Army in football in the fall of ’29
has caused much rejoicing on the local
campus. Dr. Wood announced the fact
last Thursday. On October 12, 1929,
Coaches Younger and Tilson will lead a
determined band of Wildcats to the
Academy at West Point, and with this
little band will go the hopes of Davidson
for natiofal recognition.

The gameawas scheduled as a result of
recent negotiations with the officials of
the Academy, and comes as an indication
that Davidson’s athletic policy will be-
come a very different nature in the next
few years: It will. be remembered, of
course, that last fall the committee con-
sidered scheduling a game with Army for
the fall of ’28, but the matter was dropped
after thorough discussion.

This is the first game in the history of
Davidson College of such national sig-
nificance, since it brings one of the
strongest “little” teams in the south into
actual combat with the national service
eleven, While the big day is still far
away, yet the spirit will be working all
the time, and when the time does come,
then the Cats will be ready to fight.

A. L. Mills Elected |
New Golf Captain

Arthur Mills, of Greenville, S. C., has
been elected captain of the 1929 golf team.
Mills was one of the prominent members
of the Davidson team which - finished
second in the state itlte race this season.
He and Boyce Martin, of Atlanta, Ga.,
who were paired‘in the foursome matches,
were undefeated.

Members, of the team this year were
Mills, B. F. Martin, W. L. Lingle, Jr.,
Richmond, Va., and B. A. Wilson, Marion,
N. C. These men played through a most
successful season, placing second in the
state meet held at Greensboro, and, earlier
in the season, defeating Washington and
Lee and Duke University. Two matches
were dropped to the University of North
Carolina.

State Trip is Bad.
For Young Kittens

The Wildkitten baseball team returned
last Friday from a five day trip through
the state, during which time they met
successively the Wake Forest, State, and
Carolina Freshmen.

The first game, which was scheduled to
have been played with Duke, was called
off on account of rain. nals

Easily Down Furman

The Davidson netmen won their sixth
straight intercollegiate victory by trounc-.
ing Furman University last Saturday.
The final score was 5-1. This tournament

‘was Davidson’s second triumph over the

Furman players this season:

Roddey, the Wildcat’s racquet ace, took
his sixth consecutive match from Dement,
the Furman star, in the most spectacular
event of the day.

Carr and Johnston, displaying an ex-
cellent brand of tennis, defeated Wash-
ington and Bannister, respectively, and
though Halverstadt lost his match, he put
up a strong fight against Smith.

The Davidson racqueteers were at their
best in the doubles, and the Furman net
stars were unable to return the fast serves
and well placed lofts that the Cats pre-
sented to them,

Wildcats Drop Thriller
to Duke Baseball Team

Mainly on account of the southpaw
hurling of “Lefty” Jenkins, the Duke Uni-
versity baseball team conquered Monk
Younger and his Wildcats here last
Wednesday aftérnoon by the close count
of 2to 0. Triples by Werber and Deane,
each coming with a man on base, ac-
counted for a run in the sixth stanza, and
another in the ninth. It was by exactly
this margin that the Davidson men met
defeat, since, try as they might, they were
unable to push across a single counter.
Jenkins was _inhot. water-several times,
and on two otcasions double*plays saved
him. He passed five men to first, but
when the crisis came, he always pulled out
somehow.

John McInnis, pitching for the Wild-
cats hurled a beautiful game, and had the
team hit behind him, would have won
easily. As it was, however, the Cats
let two golden opportunities slip by with-
out scoring, In the sixth there were
men on second and third and nobody
down. Captain Dulin whiffed, and John-
son received an intentional pass, loading
the sacks. Kugler then hit into a double
play to retire the side. Again in the
ninth, a typical Wildcat. rally filled the
bases, but McConnell forced Johnson at
the plate.. McAutey flew out to center, and

Kugler was caught coming home after
the catch.

The entire game abounded with spark-
ling fielding plays. Time after time,
Ratchford and Johnson pulled spectacu-
lar catches in’ the outfield, which were

a long drive far into centerfield, but

went up against a real opponent in the
Wake Forest “Baby Deacons.” Marrow
pitched a good game for the “Davidson
Fresh,” but lacked support’ in the infield
sufficient to win the game. Gibson led
the hitting for the locals, getting two hits. |
Perhaps the features of the game were |
the three :double plays made by Wake
Forest. The “Baby Deacons” won to the!
tune of five and nothing.

The “Wildkittens” played the
game of the trip against the State College '
Freshmen on the 25th. Thompson pitch- |
ed for the Davidson Fresh allowing only |
six hits to the hard-hitting State nine.
Averette pitched for ‘State allowing the
“Wildkittens” only four hits. The game
was a fast one featured by very few er-
rors.
one.

The last game of the trip was played
against the Carolina Freshmen .on the
26th. Marrow again ascended the mound
for the Davidson Fresh but was unable to
hold the sturdy Carolina sluggers with-
in bounds. The Carolina team showed up
better than the “Wildkittens” throughout
the contest and -took the heavy end of a
seven to two score. The Davidson Fresh-
men hit fairly well during this game but
seemed unable to bunch their hits effec-
tively. Proctor led the hitting for the

best |

trips to the plate,

State won by the score “of two to McGeachy

“Kittens”: getting three hits out of four

Johnson pulled it in after a thrilling run.

|He was off at the crack of the bat, and

caught the ball on the tips of his fingers
with his back to the crowd. It was the
most brilliant play’ of the game, and one
of the best seen here this year.
vRatchford and Kugler each secured two
bingles to lead the Davidson hitting, while
Deane and Werber showed the’ way for
the visitors, Harrison and Ratchford

- Returns From Trip

The Freshman tennis team, composed
of Lynn, captain; Poe, manager; Rusk
and Meacham, left last Wednesday on its
first trip: These men first went to Win-
ston-Salem, where they defeated Win-
ston-Salem High School by the score of

5-1. Davidson won three singles and both
doubles matches. The team then went to
Chapel Hill, and was defeated by the
Carolina Freshmen 5-1. However, : Poe
and Lynn won their doubles match. The
Freshmen also journeyed to Oak Ridge
and Charlotte for matches there, but were
prevented from playing by rain.

A return match with Winston Hi will
be played here today and the Carolina
Freshmen will be here later in the week.
Meets with Oak Ridge and Charlotte
High School will probably be held here
early in May. ¥

CLOSE SCORE
Visitors Are Superior in Field

Events, But Cats Show Heels
on Track

Davidson College Track Team won a
close meet from the University of South
Carolina last Saturday, taking the long
end of a 691-2 to 561-2 score, The win-
ner of the match was not definitely de-
cided until the last event, which was the
half-mile run.

The Gamecocks put up a game fight,
and had it not been for the Cats’ strength
in the dashes would likely have put in a
win. Keels, of South Carolina, deserves
special mention for his final spurt in the
2-mile run. Pulling around the track for
seven laps against a bad wind, he made a
pretty dash for the goal @f approximately
half a lap.

John Currie was high scorer of the
meet with a total of 15 points. He won
first place in the 100, 220, and 440-yard
dashes, the time being respectively, 9.9
seconds, 22.5 seconds, and 52.2 seconds.

Heath Whittle lowered the college
record in the 120-yard high-hurdles by
one-tenth of a second. Whittle has
broken the 220-yard low hurdles in a pre-
vious meet of the year, and then again
broke his own record.

The Cats showed form in the running
events, winning seven out of a possible
eight. The visitors were strong in the
field and weight events, winning five out
of a possible six first places.
