D. A. Thompson: Modest Stiliness and Humility

"And Would It Have Been Worth it, After All?"

If ever Iam to be remembered
after I graduate from Davidson, I
sincerely hope that those who knew
me will think of meas a gifted ro-
mantic. Sadly, however, I am all
too aware that such recollections
will never be shared amongst my
friends: when it comes to matters
of the heart, I am, you see, the
ultimate and reigning boob. I
confess here that I ama high rank-
ing officer in the Dork Corps:
always with acrush, often with the
nerve, but never with the grace
required. How often have I wished
that I could manage my amorous
affairs with the coolness of a big
screen legend while I stammered
out an invitation to dinner with the
pointed articulation of a cartoon
geek?

IfI were shy, could pinéaway
silently and long for my love, and
noone would know the difference.
Unfortunately, my penchant for
extroversion makes such discre-
tion impossible and I always man-

age to blow it. Cursed in this
manner, Davidson is no place for
me. The number one rule of love
here is much like that in poker:
never show your hand. No matter
how you may feel about a certain
individual, a cool head and stony
heart must be kept about at all
times. I’m not berating the unwrit-
ten system, but I admit that I can
never quite conform toit. So often
have I sniffed potential romance
and promptly routed it like quail
into the path of acocked and ready
12 gauge.

Once, having managed to keep
my cool on several dates with
someone about whom I was abso-
lutely mad, I made the mistake of
saying what a pleasant time I had
had the past few times we went
out. The young lady then looked at
me.as if I had stalked her in a
shopping mall and said curtly,
“David, you’re really too gratui-
tous with your affections.” By the
time my breath-returned, her door

Depth! Relevance!

It's Never Really Dark These Days

I was out last night when the
clock struck twelve. It wasn’t
somber. Nothing brooded. The
pasteurized moon was only a little
on the down side of full, and noth-

ing chilled my spine. I looked into.

the library from far away, and its
windows glowed like a gigantic

nightlight. FSS DS Pea  aadtien apebasih

busy. I kept walking. “Hello,” I
said to someone with books.
“Hello,” I said to someone with
beer. Collegiate experience un-
folded around me unchanged.
There is no witching hour
anymore. Pumpkins don’t turn into
’ coaches; coffin lids don’t creak. I
\ passed the steeple clock and
thought, “Five minutes after
twelve. Good. The nightis young.”
And then missed the magic. I
missed huddling in my bed atnight
with the curtains vacuum sealed
against moonlight--sheets pulled

up tighter than a hug beneath my”

chin and sometimes wrapped un-
der and around me, too, in case
floor monsters came up through
the bed. Nights were ravenous. The
buttons on my doorknobs would
be pushed. Both of them. Even the
one connected to my parents room
incase they were eaten first. I’d go
tobed too late sometimes--too close
to twelve--and lie there wrapped
and waiting for the two long pointy
fangs dangling above my pillow to
plunge into my neck. Throat skin
tingled. ‘He’s picking his Spot,” I
‘thought, ‘I just can never move.’
Intime I would wake up and in
the light unlock my doors. Now I
never lock them. I sleep a lot when
the sun is up and have typed and
typed beneath a full moon inthe
middle of the night and never
looked behind me.

That old fear was fun. My
friend Stewartdown the street liked
it so much that he decided his
basement was haunted so he could
be terrified even in the daytime.
Soon my. basement also became
haunted. We used to meet some-
times outside and compare notes

on the ghostly visions we had seen
dancing on the doors of the down-
stairs guestroom, or in the utility
room, or, mosthorribly, up, around,
and sometimes right out through
the opening leading to the crawl
space underneath the house. That
space was scary--a slice of dirty,
bug-ridden-night carved out be-
neath the noonday sun. And we
sought it-out.

Once Stewart did the unthink-
able. He crawled right through the

-hole and underneath it all, and I

couldn’teven shake I was so scared.
Henever saida word, ever. I waited
it must have been five epochal

minutes before I broke loose and

was locked and I was self-con-
scious enough to feel the hair grow-
ing on my legs.

Never before had a simple
complement been so perfectly
demeaned. In a sentence I went
from her date to a gaudy and crass
new man guilty of trying to im-
press through lavish overtipping.
With one well turned phrase this
previously delightful young
woman had sent me away like
undercooked fish. It wasn’t the
first time that I had been awarded
the top prize in college football,
but it was without a doubt the most
memorable.

Worse, though, are those epi-
sodes reeking of what could have
been. Only once have I been so
pathetically enamored that I could
not muster the nerve to do any-
thing about it. In high school I was
afflicted with a crush that would
makeeven the most seasoned doter
blush. My beloved was the center
of my every thought. Inside Iknew

screamed andran upstairs and fran-
tically barked to my mother that
Stewart had been eaten by the.
house. My mother was not so
moved as I about the possibility of
being digested; and she was on the
phone. I ran outside and back in-
side and down and up the stairs and

__., finally grabbed a whiffle bat and

hesitantly commenced to’ rescue
Stewart.

The hole was so black. The
underside of the house gurgled
behind it like an expectant gullet.
The bat went first. Then my head-
-and it was grabbed.

Stewart laughed very hard
about all the things I did in my
pants. I died for a second there, or
at least experienced all the terror
requisite in the face of passing on.

Stewart was older than me. And
apparently he had decided a little
while back that basements weren’t
really haunted; and even if they
were, the risk involved would be
well worth the pleasure gained from
scaring me nigh to death. He had
his fun, but the lasting thing was
that since then basements, and all
places at night or anytime, haven’t
moved me like they once did.

I guess it’s a good thing. Get-
ting from the library to my room at
night would be complicated by
believing that I would be eaten
along the way. But sometimes
nights feel bland and I wish a
vampire and a team of goblins
might chase me--light out after me

down Brady’s Alley and past the

post office, across the tracks and
ten years or so back down a road.

that only if I had the opportunity to
talk to her, she could see that I was
her perfect match. The undeniable
truth of our cosmically determined
pairing would be evident after just
a few words. She would be mine
and I hers and all would end in a
showering of radiance and bliss.

A few months ago, I ran into
this same young lady for the first
time in years at a party. When I
saw her, I regressed immediately
back to 17 and my braces reap-
peared upon my teeth. After a
moment and another drink, my
composure returned and I decided
that now I had no choice.

I would approach her. No
adolescent protestations of love,
mind you, but simple chit-chat
would flow forth from my lips. I
had resolve and I had purpose.
Command was mine. As {crossed
the crowded room she saw me,
and, I couldn’t believe it myself,
she smiled.

Oh joy! That welcoming,

Rude Notes and

inviting, encouraging grin was all
I had wanted for years. This face
which had been a staple of my
dream diet, which I had for so long
adored, which I used to look for in
crowds, which I still have not gone
aday without picturing since] first
laideyeson it, was smiling, at ME!
After all this time, she was smiling
at me. She:remembered me. She
did so fondly. She was coming to
speak to me!

This moment, this particular
moment, was the single greatest
instant of my existence. “After a
life spent training for the sight,” I
was ready, my nerve steeled, my
opening sentence ready every fiber
of my being perfectly honed for
this one chance. I came closer, as
did she. Perfectly sure thatnothing
could go wrong, I opened my mouth
to speak when I heard her say with
spirit in her voice, “How are you,
John?”
