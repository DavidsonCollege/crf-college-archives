Board of Trustees chairman Craig Wall dies at 59

By Mary Care JALONICK

Editor Emerita

After nine years as the Chair-
man of Davidson’s Board of Trust-
ees, E. Craig Wall, Jr., 59, died of a
heart attack March 5 in Charlotte.

The CEO of Canal Industries, a
lumber supplier and holding com-
pany, Wall was a prominent busi-
nessman and community leader in
his home of Conway, South Caro-
lina. Wall graduated from Davidson
in 1959, and each of his three chil-
dren have attended Davidson. His
youngest son, Ben, is a junior.

His funeral drew hundreds of
people from around the region, in-

cluding U.S. Senator Ernest “Fritz”
Hollings and South Carolina Gov-
ernor David Beasley.

Wall was elected to Davidson’s
Board of Trustees in 1976 as an
alumni representative. He became
vice-chair in 1985, and became chair
upon the death of then-chair Ben
Craig.

President John Kuykendall
says Wall was “a wonderful role
model and personification of all the
good things we try to promote at
Davidson.”

Current Vice-chair Olin Nisbet,
*63, of Charlotte will serve as in-
terim chair until the trustees elect a
permanent chair.

Under Wall’s chairmanship the
Board has made many important
decisions regarding the College’s
ties with the Presbyterian Church
and building expansion.

Wall attended Harvard Busi-
ness School and joined his father in
operating Canal Industries in 1962.
He became CEO of the company
upon his father’s death in 1985.

Hecontributed time andmoney
to countless organizations. At one
point, he was serving with 16 dif-
ferent organizations and had com-
pleted terms of service with 22 oth-
ers. He was president of the South
Carolina United Way campaign,
chair of the trustees at Brookgreen

Gardens, and a trustee of the
Conway Hospital Foundation at the
time of his death.

He received several awards and
honorary degrees throughout his
lifetime. In addition to Davidson,
he served on the Boards of Presby-

terian College, Coker College, .

Clemson University, and Montreat
Anderson College.

Wall’s heavy involvement be-
gan during his college career. He
was president of the Key Club, the
Honor Council, Kappa Sigma fra-
ternity and ODK. He played base-
ball and basketball, and was captain
of the football team. He also served
as an SGA Senator.

Faculty Executive Council denies
SGA-backed Veterans’ Day proposal

By NARESH NAGELLA
Associate News Editor

The supporters of Veteran’s
Day won and lost a battle during the
last two weeks, but seem to be gain-
ing ground in their effort to get the
holiday officially recognized by the
college.

The first victory came before
Spring Break, when after two and
one half hours of debate, the Stu-
dent Government Association
passed a resolution to recommend
that the school amend the official
calendar to recognize and honor
Veteran’s Day by letting professors
cancel afternoon classes.

But, last Tuesday, the Execu-
tive Council rejected the students’
proposal.

However, just to reach the fac-
ulty committee, the resolution had
to undergo much change and get
passed a vociferous minority oppo-
sition in the SGA.

The resolution was brought to
the SGA by Junior Eric Sapp. He
organized supporters of the resolu-
tion to obtain some 435 petition
signatures over two days.

The petition the students signed
said Veteran’s Day could have been
recognized since MLK day created
a “special category of national holi-
days that are deemed important
enough to the school that it is will-
ing to cancel afternoon classes on
those days.”

It also cited the “great debt we
owe to our veterans” and the fact
that until 1970 all Davidson stu-

dents had to serve in the Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC).

The resolution stated that time
should have been set aside “for
speakers and activities that will
make the student body more aware
of the sacrifices and experiences of
the men and women who have
served our country in times of war.”

However, many senators were
not happy that the resolution used
Martin Luther King Day as a de-
fense and rationale for Veteran’s
Day.

Senior Independent senator
John Hutzley says, “I have a prob-
lem with wanting some holidays
recognized and not allowing others.
[The resolution] creates a problem

Rides program
planned for Thursday

By ANN CuLp

- News Editor

If all goes as planned, the Rides
program will begin Thursday with
a five-week trial period. It will run

on Thursday, Friday, and Satu day
p ° DI 0 1 5 fu-

dent-financed and student-operated
shuttle.

The vans will leave
Richardson Dorm on the hour and
go to Harris Teeter (Exit 28), Mov-
ies at the Lake, Rainbow Deli,
Lanes at the Lake (Exit 25), and
Target. Vans will be rented from
the Davidson Motor Pool and will
be paid for out of Activities Tax
Council funds. The ATC will be
partially reimbursed by the $2
charge for a round trip ride.

To prevent drivers from col-
lecting and carrying cash, it is pro-
posed that individual ride tickets
and cards of 6 round-trip rides for
$10 will be sold at the Union. For
this first week of runs, students
will be able to pay their fares di-
rectly to the driver.

Student volunteers who have
been trained by the Davidson Po-
lice Department in an hour-long
class will drive the shuttle. Frater-
nity and eating house members
might be able to receive volunteer
hours as drivers.

The Shuttle service was con-
ceived by the Transportation Task
Force created by Dean Shandley.
The project will now be turned
over to the SGA Rides Committee
to run.

But the task force will con-
tinue monitoring it. ;

“We are real excited that we
are so close to beginning some-

thing so many people have ex-
pressed a desire for. Hopefully,
students will use the service, as well
as volunteer to help us out. Now,
it's just up to all of us to make it a
success,” says Warren Buford, a

member of the task force e
a PA (5 A qaents

needed transportation for travel,
medical needs, cultural and social
opportunities, internships, and aca-
demic requirements. In addition,
the committee wanted to address
the needs of a “safe rides” program
for intoxicated drivers. °

The “band-aid” solutions of
airport shuttles at holidays and a
department’s rental of a van from
the Davidson Motor Pool were not
meeting these needs.

The short term recommenda-
tion of the committee created the
Rides program. ._

Long term recommendations
involve the possibilities of a
Davidson town shuttle to Cornelius
and Huntersville, an extension of
the bus service which currently runs
to Huntersville at Exit 25, enlarging
the Davidson Motor Pool to allow
greater options for vehicles and driv-
ers.

Also being considered are the
addition of permanent staff to serve
as drivers, and investigating the
opportunities to involve SADD,
MADD, and/or the Red Cross with
a safe rides program at Dayidson.
This last option would involve de-
veloping a SADD chapter on cam-

pus.

Those interested in volunteer-
ing should attend an informational
meeting will be Wednesday at 7
p.m. in the Conference Room in the
Union.
