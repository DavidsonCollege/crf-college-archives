Executive committee | ee

considers smoking ban

By Jay Jennings

Smoking on campus has been
under discussion for several years,
and the issue had been raised again.
The discussion pits the right of
people to smoke against the right
of people not to be affected by the
smoke. The Excutive Committee,
headed by President Kuykendall,
is in the process of investigating
smoking in all campus buildings,
but specifically in Chambers.

In the November faculty meet-
ing, the issue of smoking in Cham-
bers came up in the open forum
part of the meeting. Professor Ruth
Ault says, “There should be no
smoking in Chambers[to ensure] a
smoke-free environment. I do not
think that I should be put in a
hazardous working environment.”

Kuykendall wanted to hear the
faculty’s opinions on this topic and
came to the faculty meeting. The
teachers who spoke at the meeting
were mostly in favor of the ban on
smoking.

Ault’s reasons for supporting
aban are that she believes there are
“valid scientific results to indicate
the harmful effects of secondary
smoking.” Also, the ventilation in
Chambers has been in place for a
long time and could accurately iso-
late aroom with smoke in it. Thus,
smoking in one office can affect
people in a non-smoking office.

Dean of Faculty Robert Will-

iams says that it not really clear
who is in charge to make the deci-
sion to ban smoking in the various
building on campus. However,
Kuykendall has the option to set
conditions for the workplace. Thus,
Kuykendall will be considering this
issue in the next couple of weeks.
Kuykendall was unavailable for
comment, because he is in India.

Dana, the biology and physics
building, has been declared a
smoke-free building for a couple
of years with very little contro-
versy. Dr. Verna Case, Head of the
biology department, says the smok-
ing ban is a mutally agreed upon
policy of the biology and physics
departments. Case says that the
smoke-free rule is “not offical
policy, but they just decided to put
up the signs prohibiting smoking.”
The reasons for the ban include the
animal facilities and the chemicals
in the building.

The policy in the chemistry
building is similiar to that of Cham-
bers, where teachers can smoke in
their offices; those rooms are es-
sentially the only locations where
smoking is allowed.

Bart Landess, the college’s
general counsel, says that the law
allows for a private employer to
regulate the working environment,
which includes smoking. Accord-
ing to Landess, all law suits that
have been brought against compa-

Soon, faculty and students may no longer be
allowed to smoke in buildings on campus.

write report
on honor code

By Meg Wolff

The SGA Ad Hoc Committee
to review the Honor Code had its
final meeting-on Thursday. At the
end of the first phase of investiga-
tion, the committee plans to write
apreliminary report on its findings
to be presented to the SGA.

Warren Buford, committee
chair, describes the dual goals of
the committee: “The first impor-
tant thing really is to find out how
Davidson faculty, staff, and stu-
dents perceive the Honor Code.
What the committee has done this
semester has reached out to those
closest to us to gather at least a
basis for that determination. The
second phase appears to be reach-
ing out, through formal interviews,
to faculty, who are a very integral
part of this process.”

This semester the committee
members have conducted infor-
mal interviews and discussions
amongst itself and with students to

concerning student perception of
the Honor Code. The committee
has also reviewed the finding of a
survey conducted last semester on
the perceived effectiveness of the
Honor Code.

For next semester the com-
mittee is currently discussing the
