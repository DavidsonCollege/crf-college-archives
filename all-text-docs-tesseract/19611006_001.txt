Widespread interest began to get a
“wild” wildcat before Homecoming.

Martin recruited quick moral and
financial support, then contacted the
Charlottetown Pet Center. The owner
came through in fine style, or so it
seemed.

“We made arrangements for an
ocelot, settled on the price and it was
to be delivered this week,” Martin
said. “The owner assured us this was
the wildcat we were looking for.”

After much ribbing, however,
Martin decided to be sure, and he’s
glad he did. Dr. E. E, Brown cleared
up the matter. An ocelot doesn’t even
look like a wildcat; it looks like a baby
leopard.

Martin cancelled the order—over
protests—and renewed the search for
a genuine, ferocious wildcat of the

To house the cat, a travelling
cage and home cage are under con-
struction. The travelling case will be
carried by trailer, and both will be
decorated in a circus style. The per-
manent cage, according to President
Martin should be placed near the
Union in a well-lighted area to prevent
attempted thefts by other schools.

Responsibility for the cat’s care
will fall to the cheerleaders. However,
Dr. Martin suggested that next year
there might be a scholarship student
put in charge of the animal. The
‘Wildcat Scholarship” would go to the
applicant showing the greatest feline-
feeding ability.

» Voluntary contributions will pro-
vide the money for the cat, with a
drive to be administered by the cheer-
leaders. The ocelot would have cost
$125; the wildcat will cost $35.

Foreign Students Want
More Than School Life

BY LEE KIRBY
Davidsonian Asso ciate Editor

In a discussion with THE DAVIDSONIAN this week, seven Richardson Scholars

expressed the hope that Davidson will find a more sat

ing the academic work of foreign students.
of the

tions aired their views for the college.

second of a series of DAVID-
SONIAN investigations of the ROTARY SCHOLARS

~" | It’s good that we have to
| work like any normal American
| student, but we don’t like hav-
ing to compete for marks on the
same basis as native students,”
|commented one, expressing the
group. opinion.

|

“As a Rotary scholar, I must
give thirty speeches this term.
Of course, all my cuts will be
excused, but I must still make
up the work I miss.”

ACADEMIC STANDARDS

“And it is much harder for
jus to make up the work in a
| language foreign to us.”

Another pointed out that pro-
fessors might make allowances
for foreign students. “But we do
not know it for certain, and be-
sides we don’t want to be set
apart so obviously. It is not good

for your academic standards
and it is not good for us.”

Some students were interest-
ed primarily in the purely aca-
demic side of their education in
America, but most dissented.

MEET PEOPLE
. “We want to meet the people
‘lof all America and i their
customs. Only a few,of as’ will
ahyway. Although none ‘of us
will be satisfied with bad grades
our year in America should not

isfactory method of evaluat-

consist of only our dorms, the
library, and Chambers.”

“Besides, we are here not so
much to learn as to teach. And
what we have to teach is great;
some of the students here know
almost nothing about Europe
and the rest of the world.”

REAL INSIGHT

“But, at the ‘present, we get
the impression that the Rich
ardson money is being spent for
our benefit alone and not for
the college.”

All emphasized, however,
that they aré seeking a real in-
sight into the American educa-
tional system and are not trying
to shirk their jobs as students.
They also agreed that they did
not want to be set apart or
treated as “outsiders.”

Most agreed that they would
like to have their work evaluat-
ed in some way other than
grades and several methods
were suggested, “There are so
few of us, that our professors
could check up on our work.”
Ratings of “satisfactory” or “un-
satisfactory” and oral examina-
tions were suggested, among
other methods.

Asked about the Davidson

student, the seven hoped “that |

no one will be shy to speak to
us, to criticise our opinions,
if he knows his reasons. Nothing
ventured, nothing gained.”

_ ‘Other criticisms? Only chapel
and vespers—they seem to “fit
in” already.

Honor System Topic
Of Faculty Meeting

what the faculty could do to

clarify and support it, was the primary topic at Tues-

day’s faculty meeting.

The discussion arose as the
result of a report by the Judi-
cial Committee of the faculty
on some problems which were
presented late last spring in a
report by out-going Honor Court

Chairman Seott Lacy and in

coming Chairman Harrison
Wellford

This report indicated that
there were several customs

practiced by some of the facul

ty which contain inherent dan
gers or strains to the. Honor
System, namely. those of givin:
the same review to two or more
sections of the same class, and
giving the same review to a
make-up section that had been
given originally

The Judicial Committee
ommended that the faculty give

rec

“Butterfield,” “Come Septem- fresh reviews to each section

ber.” and “Romanoff. andjand to each make-up section,

Juliet.” and thus reduce the strain on
the Honor System.
