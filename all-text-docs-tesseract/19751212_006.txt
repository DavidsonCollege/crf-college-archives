Two teams vie
for advisor post

By STEPHEN BELL
Senior News Editor

Next week’s election for Freshman
Advisor offers Gary Barnes and Carol
Conner running as a team against the
partnership of David Yearwood and
Tim Sellers.

In explaining reasons for his candi-
dacy with Yearwood, Sellers said,
“By running as a team, David and I
will be able to turn easily to each
other as resources.

“The job is a big one, and I’m
certain that a coordinated team can
function more efficiently than a single
advisor committed to bear the entire
burden.”’

As to her partnership with Barnes,
Carol Connor has said, ‘It is impor-
tant for a freshman’s first impression
of Davidson to include evidence that
the student leaders are representative
of the student body.

“We feel that, particularly next
year, adequate representation will
require a ‘coed’ team of freshman
advisors.”

Connor further remarked,‘‘In addi-
tion to our responsibility of estab-
lishing rapport between the hall
counselors and ourselves, we plan to
encourage more interaction among
the freshmen and the upperclass-

”

men.

Davidson freshmen need introduction

GRIZZARD AND GROGAN

Race brews for handbook editor

There are two teams of candidates
who would like to co-edit next year’s
edition of the Wildcat Handbook. Bob
Grizzard and Lee Grogan are running
against Kathy Wilson and Ann Gray
Harvey.

Grizzard and Grogan are currently
hall counselors in Cannon Dorm.
They see a need for another updating
of the materials in the Handbook.

“The part we want to really work
on is the description of the social life
at Davidson,”’ said Grizzard. “The
freshmen on our halls have asked the
most questions about this part of the
Handbook.”

“The restaurant listings also need a
going over and an updating,” noted

Grogan. ‘‘We would also like to arr-
ange the freshmen’s photographs by
halls if Scotty Nicholls has the halls
set up by the time of our deadline.

“On the general level, we want to
use @ lot of people around campus to
help us write the Handbook and put it
together. I think we want to make it
as good a picture of the Davidson
‘scene’ as we can.

“Moreover, we think the Handbook
can be used not just by freshmen, but
by everyone on campus. We can
direct it somewhat more towards
those other people. Of course it will
still be primarily for freshmen,” he
concluded. é

“The Handbook is used mostly by
freshmen to identify each other,”’
added Grizzard. ‘“‘We want to or-
ganize, get pictures in, and mail the

Handbook out to the freshmen before
orientation the way they did this
year. This would depend upon our
getting the postage fees paid by the
Alumni Fund who were gracious
enough to do it this year.”’

Wilson and Harvey. see the Hand-
book as being important in its
function of giving freshman and
transfer students an early look at
what Davidson and the surrounding
area is like.

“We would like to mail the Hand-
book out to the freshmen before they
get here,”’ said Wilson, ‘‘and have
some here for upperclassmen who
want to get to meet and know
freshmen.

‘We would also like to emphasize
the pictures of key administrators on
campus. Then, if a freshman needed

to solve a problem here quickly, he or
she would be able to recognize the
person he or she needed to go to,” she
continued.

“To write the Handbook we would
like contributions from others,’’
Harvey indicated. ‘‘For example, if
we put in a section on the SGA or the
Honor Code, it should be written by a
person who is involved with that area.
We should be more editors than
authors of the Handbook.” |

“There should be more than just
restaurants listed in the Handbook,’’
said Wilson. ‘‘Events, places 'to go,
and the social life available in the
surrounding area should be included
as well.

‘What we want most of all is to
show the freshmen a truthful view of
Davidson College,” she said.
