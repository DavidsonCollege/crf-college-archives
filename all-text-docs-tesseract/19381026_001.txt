Released —

—Thursday noon, the Court of
Control released the Freshman
class from the campus which
resulted from the painting of the
class numbers on the Davidson
town water tank. The Fresh-
men loudly acclaim the end of
the campus which had kept them
from the movies and out-of-town
trips for almost a week.

Judge -Squires, after chapel
Thursday morning expressed to
the Freshman class the wish of
the Court that they cooperate
‘with the Court’s regulations in
the future. Because of the leni-
ency of the Court of Control in
letting the class off campus
earlier than expected, Judge
Squires stated that it would
deal more severely with indi-
vidual misdemeanors.

Actors Will Present
Shakespeare’s Play

On Wednesday night, Novem-
ber 9, the Avon Players, a stock
company of Shakespearian ac-
tors, will present one of Shakes-
peare’s. most humorous works,
“The Taming of the Shrew,”
Chamber's Building.

The leader of the company,
Joseph Selman, says that this
year the company is better or-
ganized and has better scenery

and costumes than ever before;
therefore a good performance
may be expected by all who
attend.

The Avon Players have been
coming to Davidson for the past
two years, and they have always
presented an interesting pro-
gram. However, in former years
their Shakespearian selections
were tragedies, while this year
they present the most hilarious
farce that Shakespeare wrote,
“The Taming of the Shrew.”
The company plays up particu-
larly the comic side of the work;
for they have much horseplay
and humor throughout the se-
lection.
