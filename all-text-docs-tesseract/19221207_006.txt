BROTHER MARK SPEAKS
AT UNION BAND MEET

Brother Mark spoke to the union meeting
of the Volunteer and Ministerial Bands last
Sunday morning on Gal. 5:22, “The fruit
of the Spirit is love, joy peace * * * * *”
“Every one must know righteousness and
devotion when they see them, but joy is pe-
culiar to Christians. Why look sick when
all you have to endure is your Christianity ?
Enthusiasm is the real test of Christianity,
you have to be enthused before you can in-
fluence others, Peace of soul and ease of
mind come from doing what you know
God wants you to do. If we can make up
our minds to live God's will, then there is
not that struggle and hestitation when we
meet with temptation, and we have peace of
soul.”

Brother Mark delivered a warning to dis-
regard all selfish and enstranging manner-
isms. “Don't be professional in the minis-
try, but be a good workman and know your
job. Be able to play with people, thus gain-
ing their confidence and getting into close
touch with them, and then you can speak

seriously to them. You can’t be dogmatic
about your view, but win them by seeing
their view first. You must talk to a man
from his ground.’

Brother Mark, in applying this to the stu-
dent life, said, “Don’t live such a devoted
life that you can’t mix with people; as you
go out, don’t make your Christian work a
job; we must win them but not. through any
set formula, by any set gar or in any set
numbers.”

MR. W. F. JUNKIN TO
TALK AT “Y” SUNDAY

The Y. M. C. A. may count itself fortu-
nate in being permitted to hear Mr. W. F.
Junkin at the weekly service on Sunday
night. Mr. Junkin has devoted 30 years of
his life to missionary work in China, spend-
ing the greater part of this time at Sutsien.
Only two months of his furlough have
elapsed since his arrival in the United
States,

As a matter of interest, it may be men-
tioned that Mr. Junkin is related to Stone-
wall Jackson. He himself married the
daughter of Doctor Dubose, the founder of
the Anti-Opium League of China. Mr.
Junkit has had many interesting and some
dangerous experiences while performing his
duties in China. Once, while riding along on
his bicycle, duting the days of the Boxer
War, he was stopped by robbers who re-
moved his outer clothing and even took his
Bible on the pretext that it was money.

Mr. Junkin is an interesting and forceful
speaker. Out of his wide knowledge of con-
ditions in China and the foreign field gen-
erally, he is certain to give an inspiring talk
which will hold the attention of the audience.
Especially will he be helpful to those who

| plan to engage in Christian service in some

foreign country.

McBRYDE LEADS UNION
MEETING OF TWO BANDS

The first union meeting of the Volunteer
and’ Ministerial Bands was lead by Angus
McBryde in Shearer Hall at 10 o’clock Sun-
day morning, November 26th. The Volun-
teers had charge of the unusually large
meeting—40 being present.

In the opening talk, Burney summed up
the reasons why the Bands united. In the
first place, if the majority of good is to be
accomplished, ,both organizations must know
of the work the other is driving at.
Again, by combining forces and working
together, the bands will present a stronger
force for good. Burney then emphasized
the point that the primary reason which
prompted the Volunteers to unite into a
band was to bring to a definite decision those
that were thinking about going to the for-
eign field.

Benton Wharton then told that the Volun-
teers had been trying to do personal work
on the campus and had been trying to live
influential and all-around lives.
