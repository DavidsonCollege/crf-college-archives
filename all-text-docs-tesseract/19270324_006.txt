these great meetings and planning to attend

Dr. Gammon and will be an important part

PEERY,

The work at the Mill Chapel is progress-

satisfaction that a very sizeable increase in
the crowds attending these services can be
seen. This important work is a new phase
of “Y” work this spring and has grown
rapidly.
