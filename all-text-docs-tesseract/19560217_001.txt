Trustees Vote To Raise
Enrollment Of College

Davidson College trustees voted
Wednesday to increase college
salaries and to govern gradual en-
rollment increases with a general
improvement program.

President John R. Cunningham
said that both faculty and admin-
istrative personnel will receive
salary increases. The pay raises
will commence March 1, rather
than at the start of the next fiscal
year.

An increase in enrollment
would be gradual, following
further increases in faculty
salaries and endowment, and
improvement in the physical
plant and the quality of in-
struction.

Dr. Cunningham’s semi-annual
report calls attention to general
response to the needs of private
colleges, dramatically emphasized
by the Ford Foundation’s grant
of a quarter billion for raising

faculty salaries.

It also contains data on:

1. Davidson's participation in the |
Year of Emphasis on Christian |
Education being sponsored by the
Presbyterian Church, U. S.

2. The important role played by |
private colleges in educating two
thirds of the nation’s leading busi- |
ness executives.

3. The responsibility of David-|
son as college enrollment begins
a tremendous surge.

4. The improvements in and suc-

cess of the college's admissions
procedures, as applications for ad-
mission increase.
5. The college scholarship pro-|
gram that totals $106,000 this year, |
and which has been awarded to
245 students.

6. An expression of appreciation |
for the “Quality of work being

done by our Faculty in practically

Fisher and

On Gift Fund Projects —

By MAURICE CROUSE
Davidsonian Associate Editor
Dr. M. L. Fisher and Dr. Harold Ford spoke Tuesday night
at a YMCA membership meeting about projects for the 1956

Gift Fund.

Dr. Fisher spoke about mental
illness in connection with the
Alexander Home project, and Dr.
Ford gave an outline of conditions
in the Philippines to support the
project of aid to radio station
DYSR of Silliman University in
the Philippines.

Dr. Fisher said, “This is

something new. You've never
been told this before,” and he
gave numerous statistics on
the prevalence of mental ill-
ness to prove his point.
Among them were that at least
54 per cent of hospital cases
are mental in nature, and that
over one million persons re-
ceive some psychiatric care
during a given year.

One in sixteen persons will pro-
bably suffer from serious mental
disorder at some time in his life
and one of ten will be hospitalized.
Mental hospitals now have only
56 per cent of the number of beds
necessary to care for mental cases,
and there are only about 9500
psychiatrists, while 13,000 more
are needed now.

Mental illness is a large item
in. state budgets, with New York
devoting approximately half of
hers to that end. North Carolina
is far behind and cannot meet cur-
rent needs.

Psychiatric cases appear to be a
re-enactment of struggles of the
first three years of life.. Mental

illness can be treated and cured,

Ford Talk

if it is treated at the beginning of
the illness. Many children, even
at their young age, reed treat-!
ment, and the Alexander Home is!
an institution which tries to pro-
vide such treatment.

Although McKinley believed in
1896 that his mission was to take
the Philippines and Christianize
them, the islands were then and
are still Christian. But Protestant
Christians are a very small minor-
ity, only three per cent of the
total, and even this small percent-
age is splintered into several de-
nominations. Ninety percent of the
Philippinos are Catholic, and the
second largest group is Islam.

Dr. Ford agreed with Dr. Henry
Mack, who spoke at Tuesday’s
chapel in support of the radio
project, in his philosophy of
ministering to the whole man by
providing news, crop information,
health information, and music, as
well as the propagation of the

Gospel.

improvement of the Annual Giving
Program.

8. An increase in the summer
school term to 12 weeks, consisting
of two six week sessions.

Dr. Cunningham noted “with
sorrow” the deaths of three for
mer trustees during the past sev-
eral months. They are Mr. Charles
J. Williams of Jacksonville and
formerly of North Wilkesboro; Mr
Walter P. Sprunt of Wilmington;
and the Rev. C. E. Hodgin, D. D
of Greensboro

The president's report also
pays tribute to Fred G. Myers
of Spartanburg, S. C., who be-
came Davidson's  elevenih
Rhodes Scholar in December.
He is a member of the senior
class.

Informal life at Davidson ceniers largely around the
David Ovens College Union. Here students and faculty alike
get away from the pressure of college life and spend a
pleasant hour over a friendly game of chinese checkers, or
watching a ten-gallon tropical fish aquarium with no fish, or
looking at old United States currency in a glass case.
