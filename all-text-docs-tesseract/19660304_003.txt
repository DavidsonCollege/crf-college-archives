For Area Conference

the Interfraternity Council meet-
ing Monday night.

The conference will be held

sity of Tennessee, Tom Coving-

Mrs. Abernethy |
Shows Paintings

An exhibition of paintings and
drawings by Helen M. Aber-
nethy will be displayed in the
Cunningham Art Center during
the month of March.

This is the second showing of
Mrs. Abernethy’s work at David-
son. In a previous showing for
the faculty wives club in the
College Union, the local artist
displayed a group of still-lifes
and sketches.

Mrs. Abernethy, whose hus-
band is philosophy professor Dr.
George Abernethy, was at one
time a commercial artist in Chi-
cago and has taught art in the
public schools of Ann Arbor,
Mich., and Indianapolis, Ind. She

served as Associate Professor *

of Art at Barber-Scotia College
in Concord.

The local artist received her
B. S. degree from the University
of Wisconsin and her M. A. de-
gree from the University of Chi-
cago. She has studied at a num-
ber of art schools, including the
Chicago Art Institute and the Art
Students’ League in New York.

ton, fraternity liaison officer,
described the conference as ‘‘an
information exchange among in-
terfraternity councils in the
Southeast.

“It will be similar to the
National Interfraternity Confer-
ence, but on a smaller scale,"
Covington added. Such _ topics
as co-op buying and fratersity
status on campus will be dis-
cussed. Representatives from
national fraternities will be pres-
ent as resource personnel. The
IFC plans to send five members.

David Westfall, IFC Greek
Week chairman, announced sev-
eral recent plans for Greek
Week. A banquet is planned
Monday night, April 4, to start
the week. William LeClere, exec-
utive secretary of Chi Psi fra-
ternity, will be the guest speak-

“We thought that it was real

Pi Kappa Alpha representative.
“Both the students present and
the faculty seemed to enjoy it
We were a little
disappointed however, that there
was only one student there who
was not in our fraternity.”

The IFC emphasized that all];
members of the student body are

Wednesday Deadline
Set For Election Filing

Wednesday midnight is the
deadline for filing for the Honor
Court, Student Council, YMCA,
student body offices, cheerlead-
ers and freshman advisor.

Lee Fanning, chairman of the
Elections Committee, said that
few notifications were in, but
that he expected the majority
[of them just before the dead-
line.
| Students wishing to run for
office should first go to either
Fanning or Bill Logan and sign
ja statement to agree to con-
form with campaign procedures.
They should then pick up a
| stencil for their platforms.

The content of the platform
is entirely up to the candidate,
as long as he uses no slander-
ous or derogatory remarks. The

' stencils should be returned to

Fanning before 6 p.m. Thurs-
day, so that they can be sub-
mitted to Thom Blair of the
statements committee. After the
platforms are approved and
printed, the copies will be re-

Area High Schools
Debate In Tourney

The first annual Wildcat High
School Debate Tournament was
held at Davidson last weekend,
with 15 schools in the state par-
ticipating.

Lee Edwards High School in
Asheville and Reynolds High
School in Winston-Salem tied for
first place.

Davidson debate coach Ray
MeMillin was pleased with the
turnout, which he termed about
“average for such a_ tourna-
ment."’ He added that he hoped
that the tournament could be
made an annual affair.

On April 6 Davidson will host
the District Playoff for the North

Carolina Forensic Union of high :

schools. This tournament is spon-
sored by the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.

turned to the candidates some-
time before 9 p.m. Friday.

If a student needs to use an
absentee ballot, he should sign
his election card and bring it to
Fanning’s room sometime be-
fore elections. The election
cards will be distributed in
chapel Thursday.

The only change in this year's
election procedure is the time

of voting for the YMCA presi-
dent. This voting will be post-
poned a day so that students
will have time to hear presiden-
tial candidates’ speeches before
they vote.

This year, Bill Taylor is in
charge of ballot printing, Alan
Johnson is in charge of ballot
counting and Bill Logan is in
charge of publicity.

Ford Challenge Grant.
A student committee, headed

by Joe Jelks and composed of
leaders from each fraternity and
the Independents, met for din-
ner Wednesday night to set up
the campaign organization.
The object of the campaign
is to contact potential donors
who are not associated with the

college in any formal capacity

and who would therefore not be
contacted by the regular cam-
paign drive.

The committee hopes to raise
the $250,000 by June 30. The
Ford Foundation will give Dav-
idson 40 per cent of whatever
the students raise.

“NEW FRIENDS’

The basic plan of the cam-
paign is as follows: Each mem-
ber of the student body will be
furnished with a card, on which
he will list the names and ad-
dresses of five potential ‘‘new
friends” of Davidson.

The students will return these
cards to the alumni office by
March 15 and the college will
mail the potential donors a let-
ter from President D. Grier Mar-

tin and explanatory literature
about the college and the Ford

Challenge -Fund.
During spring break the stu-
dents will contact all those peo-

ple whose names they gave to

the college and will hopefully se-
cure a pledge from them. Each
student will be furnished with
literature about the college and
the Ford Challenge Grant which

will enable him to discuss the
fund drive intelligently with the

potential donor.

W. L. Bondurant, director of

alumni activities, stated that stu-
dents should contact their par-

ents or alumni in their area
and ask for information about
people in their area who might

be willing to contribute.

The student should then write
the potential donor, Bondurant
said, and set up an appointment

mism that the campaign will
succeed. ‘$250,000 is reaching
high, but it can be done. Fif-
teen years ago students raised
$80,000 for the swimming pool in
Johnston’ Gym.

“Our goal is a lot higher
than that this time, but we think
that it is possible for the stu-
dents to reach it. We have no-
ticed that students can often
make progress in fund-raising
drives where alumni can’t.”

He noted that a pilot student
fund-raising committee raised
$3,000 during Christmas vaca-
tion. “This campaign will give
the students a chance to par-
ticipate in Davidson's effort to
compete with the finest men's

pipe selection of domestic and imported
briars, as well as imported tobaccos. This
