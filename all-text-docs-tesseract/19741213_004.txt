He criticized the Senate for
its inefficiency and failure to

Roylance that his
basic approach with the Board

cooperation.

“Our campus is not a

He called for greater leader-

closer coordination of the
union, Patterson Court, and
dorm activities.

“Patterson Court is begin-

overcrowding. A short-range
solution would be to convert

solution might be to build a
central union eating facility,”
Roylance said.

“I’d like to see the Senate
publish a few booklets such as
“50 Ideas for Freshman Dorm
Activities.” We need to create
a pool of ideas that people can

aware that funding is
available for dorm activities.

Student Leaders Emerge In Elections

By MARK WILENSKY
Managing Editer

The Student Government
Association (SGA) elections
board has announced the slate
of candidates for Tuesday’s
campus-wide elections.

Elected officers at Davidson
serve from mid-term of the

year of their election until

mid-term of the following
year, except in the cases of
certain publication editors
who serve from September to
May.

As always, the key race will
be for the presidency of the
SGA. Vying for the mandate to
succeed Blain Butner are
rising seniors John Munce and
Rick Roylance (See related
story).

The major responsibility un-
dertaken by the SGA vice
president is the chairing of the
Residence Hall Council.
Senior Scott Prince takes on

juniors, Marc Menchel
and Lynne Keener.

The much maligned student
annual, Quips and Cranks will
have one of three candidates
as editor. Peter Goodman,
Randy Hunter, and Hal Mc-
Coy compete as rising seniors
to succeed Jeff George.

THE'DAVIDSONIAN will be
under the editorship of
‘Executive Editor *Mark
Deaton. As in the past two
elections, the candidate is run-
ning unopposed and has been
confirmed by the SGA election
board.

Roylance also felt that
changes needed to be made in
the campus laundry.

“I'd like to see the laundry
facilities go non-mandatory
and made for self-
service. I think the present
laundry is useful for many
students; I think we should
keep it open, but keeping it
mandatory does not meet
students’ needs,” Roylance
said. :

He does not support the
building of off-campus
housing by the college as he
feels this would be detrimen-
tal to the sense of community
Davidson maintains as a
residential college.

Roylance called for a more
efficient use of Senate funds.
“There’s no reason why we
can’t resort to the same tools
that the administration uses.
We could think about sending
out a newsletter to the alumni
to let‘them know how students
think,’’ said Roylance.

Roylance, “‘and I think the key

Munce serves the Senate ag

‘parliamentarian, a member of

the Trustee Governance
Committee, a member of the
Faculty Extended Studies
Committee, chairman of the
SGA Constitution and By-
Laws Committee, chairman of
the SGA Psychological Coun-
seling Committee, and as a
member of the Senate
Executive Committee.

“The SGA is all students and
deals’ with all student con-
cerns,’’. said Munce.

“The role of the SGA
president, then, is to act as
coordinator of all activities,
working to fulfill students’
needs, to act as a spokesman
for the SGA, to direct the
Senate, and to represent
students on various advisory
councils and before the ad-
ministration and Board of
Trustees. t

“The SGA president must be
able to discern and help define
the directions of student con-
cerns,’’ Munce said.

Munce sees the role of the
Senate as two-fold.

“Through its meetings, the
Senate should act as a
clearinghouse for information ~
and serve as a forum for
discussion, and secondly, it
should initiate and coordinate
action.”  °-

According to Munce, the
major objective of the student
body and the SGA Senate lies
in ‘‘combatting the myth of its
own impotence.”

“All the difference in the
world in student government
comes down to two things:

‘First, people believing they

can do something, and second, ‘
enduring the agonizing
process of maintaining con-
tacts and seeing issues.
