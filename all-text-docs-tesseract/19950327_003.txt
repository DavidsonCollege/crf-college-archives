Kappa Sig runs for the gold.

Kappa Sigma honors
brothers with MADD Run

By Mary Laura Moretz
Staff writer

Kappa Sig brothers ran a total
of 63 miles on Saturday — all the
way from Davidson to Salisbury
and back. The run raised money
for Mothers Against Drunk Driv-
ing and honored two Kappa Sigs
who died in an automobile acci-
dent in 1989.

The two men that died, “John-
O” Reynolds and Patrick Virtue,
were friends and fraternity broth-
ers from Salisbury. Reynolds at-
tended Davidson, and Virtue went
to University of Colorado at Boul-
der. Both of their chapters of the
fraternity had a history of support-
ing MADD with various
fundraisers.

John Cook, Assistant to the
Director of Alumni Relations at
Davidson and a friend of John-
Reynolds, says it seemed only natu-
ral to start a MADD run to the
students’ hometown.

Formerly, Kappa Sig spon-
sored a MADD run to Charlotte.
Cook, who graduated from
Davidson in 1992, “started the run
way back when” and still advises
the Kappa Sigs as they plan the run
each year.

The Davidson Kappa Sigs

Signed up for different miles of the

run and began their journey at 8
a.m. at the Davidson Town Green.
They finished up back in Davidson
around 5 p.m.

Their route took them to

- Salisbury, where the Reynolds fam-

ily welcomed them with a brunch.
Family and community members
then made part of the run for the
next few miles. Cook ran these .
miles with Virtue’s father.

Other runners included
Davidson students who are friends
of the families and a few members
of other fraternities and . eating
houses. Sophomore Thomas
Daniel, who helped coordinate this
year’s run, wanted to expand par-
ticipation. He says, “We want to
raise awareness that this is not ex-
clusively a Kappa Sig event, but it
is important to us that brothers run
each mile.”

Money donated to MADD
came from various donations, cor-
porate sponsors, and sales of the
commemorative t-shirts.

Court is bad...in general it gets in
the way of what I value and how I
want to educate students,”says
German Professor Scott Denham.

Davidson’s social life is not a
black or white issue, and most fac-
ulty do not have clear cut opinions
about it.. Some, however, do.
However unclear, many issues re-
lated to Patterson Court stand out

in our professor’s minds.as posi#
tives or negatives’ affecting stu-

dents at Davidson.

Davidson professors have for-
mulated their perceptions of fra-
ternities. and eating houses using
many different sources. Some only
know what they have seen in the
classroom, and some have seen a
Saturday night first hand. Many
have been here for several years
and base their percep? —
tions upon the days of
the 18 year old drinking
age,. when professors
drank more freely with
all students.

No matter what the
source, the words and
thoughts of this cross |
section of professors
touch on all aspects of
the Patterson Court
scene.

Generally, most professors
do not have a problem with actual
existence of Patterson Court.
Chemistry Professor Mitchell
Rhea, advisor for PiKA, says that
the typical college party is “part of
the growing up process-- the ab-
sence or presence of the court will
not help that any: You’ ve just got
to get it out of your system, al-
though we don’t condone it, it will

go on. [On-campus parties are] ©

better than off-campus-- if its go-
ing to happen it might as well be on
foot rather than behind the wheel.”

English Professor Sara
Beasley, '86, agrees, but adds a
sentiment echoed by most faculty.
“T respect a student’s right to have
a social life- non academic energy
is good in the college years- the
problem comes when students are
prohibited from following through

Sally McMillen

with academic obligations.”

Chair of the Music Depart-
ment William Lawing notices that
a disproportionate amount of stu-
dents apparently involved with
Patterson Court seem to be absent
or falling asleep in early morning
classes. “There seems to be a rela-
tionship,” he says “We have our
eyes open...we take roll, we notice
who is falling asleep. You want
your students to be invested.”

Math Professor Todd Will says
he has taught some morning classes
in which students “look like they
have been put through the wring-
ers, and that is unfortunate.” How-
ever, he says “‘the bit of hazing that
seems to destroy the pledges is the
only downside. [Patterson Court]
looks like. a healthy environment
tome. That some drinking goes on
is no problem; the problem comes
at the point where the drinking
intrudes on their studies or their
physical well being.”

Political Science Professor
Mary Thornberry, amember of the
Alcohol Revi-
sion Council,
sees Davidson
drinking as more
‘| of a short-term
problem. “My
sense is that there
does not seem to
be a problem of
long-term alco-
holism. Moststu-
dents show up for
class. There are, however, tenden-
cies for binge drinking. The cases
of alcohol poisoning worry me.”

She would like to see more
alcohol education for students and
“a sense that it is possible to party
without alcohol. But everyone tells
me that it’s never going to happen.
The Court as a social scene, how-
ever, is good. We can’t blameitall
on the Court. Students drink in
their rooms as well.”

Many see the general gap be-
tween academics and social life to
be a disappointment. History Pro-
fessor and Rusk advisor Sally
McMillen says she wishes that
“there weren’t such a division be-
tween social and academic
life... whether [students spend time
at] the Union or on the Court, it’s
too bad that we can’t communicate
better.” :

She says, “Women’s eating

_ demic and social worlds.

houses have invited us down, and
that has always been really nice. I
wish that there could be more
events that involve faculty interac-
tion.”

Will points out the problem
that many faculty find when at-
tending Court functions.
“Patterson Court seems to be a
good place for interaction, but
many are uncomfortable seeing
underage drinkers.”

Beasley sees a different prob-
lem. As a student here, she often
mingled with professors on the
Court. However, she has found
that many current students want a

complete separation of their aca-
“Stu-

dents feel guilty if they see a pro-
fessor after they have been drink-
ing,” she says.

Denham sees this separation
of worlds as the major problem
with Davidson’s social system. “It
is important for me to integrate
intellectual experiences and fun,”
he says. “When I see things on
Patterson Court
that [come from]
the national fra-
ternities, it up-
sets me because
it’s so anti-intel-
lectual. [The na-
tional fraterni-
ties] have differ-
ent concerns
than those at a
highly selective,
liberal arts college like Davidson.”
He sees fraternity tradition imposed
on Davidson students. He asks, “If
fraternities were to start from
scratch here, would they come up
with paddles and road trips?”

Denham advocates the old
system of co-ed eating houses. “My
wife was a student at Davidson,
and when I would come visit her
the houses were very differentthan
they are now. There was a whole
lot of talking going on.” He won-
ders why students have not at-
tempted to change the current sys-
tem.

He says, “Everyone needs an
outlet. It’s not that [professors]
don’t want [students] to play. It
just seems like the opportunities
for different kinds of play are lim-
ited.”

English Professor Gail Gibson
sees a similar problem. She ex-

Scott Denham

presses disappointmentat the turns
that Patterson Court has taken in
the last few years, and after hear-
ing all sorts of stories about abuses,
she made the conscious choice to
“withdraw.” y.

Gibson believes that the Se-
nior Apartments have made a dif-
ference in relations between the
sexes. “The environment there is
so much more natural than the other
dorms, where the rooms are lined
up like cells and students tend to
behave like inmates.”

Many professors see male/fe-
male relations as a problem at
Davidson. Political Science Pro-

fessor Shelley Rigger gets the im-
pression that “men and women

don’t hang-out together much.
Single sex can sometimes nurture
unhealthy environments. Single
sex is not necessarily natural.”

Wertheimer expresses a simi-
lar feeling. “I’m not sure that
[Patterson Court] is the most pro-
ductive encounter between the
sexes,” he says.
However, English Profes- °
sor Cynthia Lewis visited
the Court this semester and
felt that relations seemed
healthy. She says, "I was
surprised at how comfort-
able men and women
seemed to be with each
other.”
Beasley looks back at the
co-ed houses and notes
that they “took the pres-
sure off. Students did not feel that
they were endangered.”

Some professors have noted
defensiveness on the part of frater-
nities. McMillen says that the

fraternities tend to try to “‘overex-
plain their existence.” Rigger feels
that there is little persecution and
most of it stems from a lack of
alternatives. The lack of alterna-
tives to the Court seems to be the
biggest concern to most faculty.

Levering sees a problem with
the exclusivity of fraternities. “‘In-
stinctively I wish that the member-
ship could be more open. I am not
anti- fraternity, but my ideal would
be that the men’s eating houses
could be the same.”

Lawing agrees. “[Many] fac-
ulty would feel that the manner of
‘ seléction by which the fraternities

is fundamentally flawed.”

Denham calls the self-selec-
tion process a “lie. The college is
looking the other way. Either there
should be an open system or na-
tional fraternities should be
banned.” He also sees that the tra-
dition that many fraternities per-
petuate is “classist, sexist and rac-
ist--two or three in particular. Look
at Old South. What does that say
about KA?”

Lawing recognizes that fac-
ulty are idealistic, but asks “What
is our job here? We are giving
students a liberal arts education.
We have to be idealistic, and we
ought to be. We don’t live in
Davidson, so we probably have
skewed perceptions, and we tend
to speak in sound bites which is too
bad. I think, though, that there is
something that goes into that.”

Beasley would like to know
the real story. “I would just love to
be invited to a fraternity house,”
she says.

with the Dean of Students, BSC,
and SGA. We have made head-
way. We don’t want anyone un-
comfortable. This is not a race
issue. It has just been miscon-
strued. We were doing our job.”

Ray Thrower, head of the
Davidson Campus-Police,—adds,
“The officer did not know who
was in the car because of the tinted

windows. It could have been any-
one.” He states that there have been
recent incidents involving non-stu-
dents stealing, most recently from
Baker. “We realize that this is the
students’ community, and we are
here to help them. But they must
help us.”

On March 14, SGA member
Nikki Liverman brought the inci-
dent to the SGA’s attention. At
Tuesday’s meeting, Liverman and
Latasha Jenkins, Chair of the Com-
mittee on Minority Concerns
(COMA), will present a proposal
for the SGA’s approval.
