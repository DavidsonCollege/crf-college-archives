The Spirt of Giving .

It should go without. saying that. the
spirit of Davidson —h
closely identified with the things that
are considered best in collegiate circles.
There is an ideal’ standard which we
subscribe to even if we are not always

has always been

Davidson — spirit is
something we can see more clearly. per
haps, when we are no longer here in

college.

Out of this Davidson spirit was born
the Christmas Gift Fund. Only when
the whole of a student body is filled with
a desire to show its spirit to the whole
world would such a thing be possible.
This token but a real at-
tempt, a tangible way to show that the
purposeand ambitions we possess are
real. By this time the majority of the
new. men will be thoroughly ° familiar
with what the old men have done in
the past. The procedure, the campaign,

is no minor

- and all the details have been laid before

you. ‘his is a thing that Davidson has

always taken to“its heart. The Y.M.C.A?’

in the past has only initiated the drive;
the rest has sprung spontaneously from
the student body itself. It has not been
a thing that necessitated begging; it has
offered ‘the opportunity to each student
to give because deep inside him was the
urge to share with others, especially at
the Christmas season.

Circumstances now are somewhat dif-
ferent from what they have been in the
past. There are fewer to give yet there
is more to be done. There has been a
feeling that some of the best from Da-
vidson’s past. may have slipped a little.

This is a chance of chances to prove that
deep inside, Davidson is what she has
always been and always will be.

It would not at all be indiscreet to ask
now the question, WHY? What is it in
a more real form that necessitates this
and: makes it a highlight of our college
year,

There are many, many reasons

which occur to every person here. They

are the obvious answers from a nation of

power and plenty. They are home,

school, the blessings of a great free land.

Among these and yet apart stands one
that we should never forget. The motto
our college begins: Alenda Lux—
Where there is light. I is this light which
should never be forgotten, A light of re-
ligion, of freedom, and of learning which
illuminates the whole nation and the whole
world beyond.

of

This is what we must cherish as a
priceless heritage. It is in the light of this
heritage that we should make our gifts.
We should send them out into the world
as we have done in past years. We may
keep them at home to commemorate those
who have died to preserve it as wé now

choose to do. Whatever we do, we should.

give this as token in evidence that we live
and work to preserve this spirit which we
believe is eternal. Not only here but in
the‘hearts of all-‘men.

To the ASTRP...

Time moves on and another army unit
takes. its leave of Davidson. The boys
in the ASTRP have not failed to make
an impression by their stay on the campus.

It can be sincerely said that this is the
friendliest, most » Davidson-like group
that we could have hoped to have had
here. They have made a real place in our
hearts by their warm friendliness of at-
titude and action. Due to their regulations
and separation of interests a more inti-
mate relationship in college and social life
has not been possible. We are sure, how-
ever, that what has been missed has been
made up by the pleasant contacts which
were possible. ,

It is our hope that every boy will take
something with him from here that will
be of value throughout his army career
and his life. We feel that Davidson al-
ways makes,its impression on all those
who come in contact with it. We indeed
hope that this has been such with the
ASTRP’s that some of their number
will return as regular students to finish
their education.

Their chief contribution to us has been
to remind us visibly of the war that we
find ourselves in. College life is some-
what cut off from the main channels of
events but with uniformed men always
here we cannot forget. We know there

‘is a war and a peace for the younger
generation to fight and win.

In conclusion we say good-bye and the
best of everything to each member of
the unit.

Jestings
By Justa Joak.

Even though there was only one
day for Thanksgiving this year many
boys seemed to enjoy that day,
Many of them made the trip home
only to spend a few hours
their folks and eat that wonderful
meal ot Turkey and all the things
that go with turkey., As the
boys that remained here on the Hill
there was a fine trip to Charlotte
for most, of them with the Thanks-
giving dinner at the Ship Ahoy, The
Steak House, Thé Tavern and many
other unmentionable places. After
dinner there was the ball game and
at the ball game your
Snooper made numerous observa-
tions. Among them were Hose Nose,
Oily, Boarman, Dave Johnson, Ma-
hone, and Double Dip. all
seemed have a fine time eyen
though Mahone and Double were
late for the game since they found
some old friends at the Hotel Char-
lotte. Myatt, McArn, Barringer,
Sinclair and two or three others
were too good to sit in the end zone
and they had teserved seats even
though Myatt and his crew did get
in by telling the man he played for
Davidson. After. a

With the coming Queens-David-
son affair also comes a square dance.
Webster's defines it as “any dance,
asa quadrille, in which the dancers
are arranged to form a square,” but
I have yet to see any exhibition of
the dance when the group ends up
in a square, The formation is made
up of usyally four couples assem-
bled into a square but after a series
of twirls, promenades, and exchang-
ing-partners, one is lucky to end up
with his original partner—let alone
forming a square,

Everybody is getting dates, sup-
posedly; even Wommeldorf is get-
ting a date!! Now is the question:
what is the proper thing to do at

such a dance? Should you ask your

date if she care dice! No. That
“line” is prope a forthal dance,

but this isn't a formal dance. You
should cautiously approach her and

then with a lighting thrust grab her

hand and “drag” her out to the

dance floor. The reason I use drag
is because a barn dance ‘is supposed
to bring out the “hillbilly” in you.
Your be

clothes should

old “ones
although probably the Queens’ girls
will probably wear something civi-
lized like shirts and sweaters (what's
wrong with that ?).

The music is not the romiatic type
nor swing. It has its special brand
of combining notes to produce a
noise not too! unpleasing to the ear.

After the and

dance _a_ fellow

his date may do many things (Tee- :

hee). They may visit the fraternity
houses and proudly show the girls

the ‘honors,

awards, or members
which their chapter possesses, or if
they have a passion for reading
_ they may go to the library and

enjoy a few silent hours among Col-
eridge, Wadsworth, Keats,
others.

and

Hardly ever does a boy get “stuck” -
at such a dance. There are several
methods to avoid this. The first and
easiest of these is the “mixed” me-

thod. During the dance you ‘change sof

partners. You keep doing this until
you find the girl you would like
to dance with other than your date.
But this time you don't change and
keep right on dancing till the end
of the dance.

The second method can be done
quite easily after you have acquir-
ed some skill in it. The treatment
is a little rough on the girl but it
works. The boy begins twirling un-
til he has gotten up a considerable
amount,of speed. Then after taking
good aim he quickly releases
hold on the girl. The result is as
react to the
laws of centrifugal force and go
flying off into space. Thus he.doesn't
have to worry about being stuck
the rest,of the evening although he
may be sued for assault and battery.

To add a little color to the dance
every gentlemen (?) should be chew-
ing some tobacco. Their dates may
not like this for particular reasons,
but it was only a suggestion.’

Now readers ‘(if there are any)
you are all probably wondering why
I wrote such an awful piece of
“corn”. I thought that I might -be
able to give a few tips to some of
you yankees who don’t know much
about these things and I also was
rudely awakened in the middle of
the night by a’ spectre: of inferno
(the editor) and told that I’had to
write something. So here it ‘is. For-

give me, please, for This Might B
