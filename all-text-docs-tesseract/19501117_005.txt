In Third and Fourth in Last Week

By WALLACE ABBOTT

At closing week of the intramural season, around the
campus can be heard both moans and sounds of relief on the
parts of the sports managers of the various fraternities. Many
of them are glad the year is just about over. but there are a
choice few who wish they had it all to do over again, thinking
that maybe they would get ‘‘the breaks’’ this time. However,
the season is within a week of being over, and it appears that
the Betas and Kappa Sigs will settle it in their game next week.

ATO 4FD.Phi Gam 2FD

Although it has taken the ATO’s
a long time to gain their first sea-
son victory, when they finally did,
they won it soundly. It was the
Phi Gams who were the victims of
a rejuvenated ATO team which
didn’t have a pass completed against
them all day. For the ATO's the
passing of Jim Schupin and the

Phi Delts 6-SPE’s 6

Although both teams got off to
very slow starts, it was the Phi
Delts who came to life first and
thus were able to edge past the
SPE's on First Downs 4.0. The
Phi Delt touchdown was tallied by
Bill Bacon on a short run. A long

Sigma Chis 6-Phi Delts 0

Heads up football all through this
game by the Sigma Chis, was the
deciding factor which gave them a
well deserved victory over a strong
Phi Delt team. Both teams showed
excellent defensive strength, but
neither one was able to get much
of an offensive started. However,
the Sigma Chis had enough of an
offensive in Berry and Kelton to
lead them to a victory. On the Phi
Delt team Bill Bacon did his
usual fine job of passing, taking ad-
vantage of many capable receivers.

Kappa Sige 14.Phi Gams 0

The Kappa Sigs got off to a
slow start in their game with the
Phi Gams, but came back strong
near the end to gain a victory. The
Kappa Sigs took advantage of
several good breaks to score, one
of them being the completion of a

perhaps in the best shape they
have been in all season. Constantly
hampered by injuries and in-eligi-
ble players, they have had a hard
time making ends meet. This Sat-
urday the entire squad will be ready
to go except for Hershel Atien
who has a separated shoulder.

In TD's For State
To Nip Cats, 15-7

By CHARLIE HAWKINS

The North Carolina State foot-
ball team evidently forgot to take
into account that Davidson’s Wild-
cats were still the scrappers of by-
gone days at Raleigh last Satur.
day night. The Wildcats did a little
rebounding of their own, but a
brilliant bid. for victory fell short
as the Wolfpack came out on top
of a close 15.7 score.

The story behind the game was
Davidson's great defensive play.
The same Wildcat litie had been
clawed to pieces by a strong VMI
team just the week before. Against
State, however, the resemblance
wasn’t the same, as Davidson's
forward wall held time after time,
diagnosing Wolfpack plays ex-
pertly and smashing them

In the third quarter, State's all
purpose tailback Ed Mooney spear:
headed a drive to the Wildcat seven

yard line, where it was first down.

The ball ended up on the David-
son three as the Cat line held.
Seconds later when Auburn Lam.
beth faded back into the end zone
to pass, the State line rushed in to
make him fumble. The ball squirted
out of a State player's ‘hands into
the hands of a Davidson defender,
who fell on it for a safety, giving
State a 2.0 lead.

A few minutes after the fourth
quarter began Wolfpack tackle Re.
gis Lisk recovered a Wildcat fum-
ble on the Davidson "38 yard line. |
Ed Mooney, who was a standout all
night for State, passed to Jim O°.
Rourke on the | yard line, and O'-
Rourke went over a few plays later
for the score. A few minutes later,
State got the ball deep in their own
territory and drove 68 yards for a
score, Ed Mooney passed to Jim
O’Rourke again on the one yard
line, and this time Mooney himself
went over. State’s blocking back,
Ray Barkouskie, who had missed
the first try for the extra point,
made this one, and State's scoring
ended at 15 points.

The only dope that the Kittens
have on the Asheville-Biltmore
squad is that they beat P. J. C.
§6-0. The Kitten’s morale is high
and they are out to avenge the
three defeats that they have suf-
fered, and you can expect a much
improved team over the Kittens
of old. The starting lineups will
probably be: Andy Courts and Lee
Knotts at ends, Neale Graham and
Bob Loy at tackles, Bill Grey and
Malphns Bradbury at guards, P.
C. Davis at center, Johnny Grey at
quarterback, Rod Herrellson at
right half, Dan McCall at left half,
and Bill Noel at fullback.

You can expect a well-fought ball
game Saturday as the Kits will
throw everything in the book at

Asheville-Biltmore in order to win
this climax game.

Davidson received the kickoff
from State and marched from their
own 45 yard line to the Wolfpack
36. From here, fullback Ham Wade,
took a pitchout from quarterback
Auburn Lambcth and = rambled
around end for a 36 yard score. It
was a beautiful run as he moved
down the sidelines to the 5 yard
line and then reversed his field to
run through a host of State tacklers.
Ham's fine kicks and this run kept
alive the Wade family's jinx on
State; last year it was Jake Wade
who ran 95 yards for the winning
talley against the Wolfpack. Gor-
don Stuart converted for Davidson.

and the scoring ended at 15-7.

Davidson uncovered a new run-
ning star in Roy White, who broke
through the State line for gain af.
ter gain, and Auburn Lambeth com.
pleted five passes to up his total
to 205. However, it was the whole
Davidson defensive tcam that tcok
the limelight in this well_played
game.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

have stuck

my neck out!”

They had our slow-moving brother moving at too fast
a pace with those quick-trick cigarette tests! A fast puff ...a swift sniff.
a quick inhale ...a rapid exhale. Terrapin’s head was spinning —

didn’t know if he was coming or going! But he slowed down to his own

speed — decided there was no need to rush. After all, he figured,
how could anyone possibly prove cigarette mildness so fast?
And he was right, too! That’s why we suggest:
The sensible test ...the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test, which
simply asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke —
on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap
judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels — and only
Camels — for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat,
T for Taste) we believe you'll know why...

More People Smoke Camels

than any other cigarette!
