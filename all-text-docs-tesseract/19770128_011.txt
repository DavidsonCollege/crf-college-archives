“Going to the Outer Banks, off the
Carolina coast, during the winter is
totally different because most of the
summer places are closed and that’s
the beauty of the place.

“The people that stay year round
are really nice and they appreciate
having you come in and shop or talk.
They’ll go out of their way to make
you feel relaxed.

“Coming in from the northern end
on Rt. 158 you should stop at the
Chamber of Commerce building out-
side Kill Devil Hills. They know what
places are open and it anything
special is going on and you can even
make reservations right there.

‘Either stay in one of the little
places, like the Bucaneer or camp at
the National Seashore. If you’re in a
Holiday Inn you’ll miss it all. Owens
and the Croatoan are good places to
try and everything is cheap this time
of year.

“Self-entertainment is what it’s all
about. Jockey Ridge, the sand dune
near the Wright Brothers Memorial,
is a really neat place to be around.
You can rent hang gliders from John
Harris, just across the street and
some people parachute on the south

met just wander around trying to find
the right wave. It’s good getting out
of your niche by seeing others.

‘‘The old houses on stilts are
interesting. Some of those cottages
have water marks six feet up the wall
because the islands are barely above
sea level.

‘The state runs a ferry to Okracoke
a couple times a day. The village is
really pretty and is spread out all
‘around their harbor, which is called
Silver Lake. Some big boats lay up
there on the way up the coast and it’s
a great place to watch the sun go
down over the water.

“Bill’s Restaurant is right over ithe
water and the crabcake is fantastic.
There’s a little general store next door
and it’s the best place to go just to
talk. Up the street near the post office
is the Village Craftsman. They’ve got
all kinds of handmade stuff and the
walk up the sand street beneath the
live oaks is worth the time.

“They've got the wild ponies on the
northern end of the island and it’s
great to just watch them out on the
beach.

“In town stay at the Island Inn. It
is really rustic and the family that

cardboard are fun too.

‘‘Bodie Island, the strip of land
before Oregon Inlet is the most built
up. There’s a campground at the tip
before the bridge. Owens is a great
restaurant and Sam & Omies has a
special every night, along with pin-
ball, pool, and fish stories.

‘‘Pea Island is-right across the
bridge and if you catch the migratory
birds right it is unbelievable. The
dismalness of it all is part of what I
like.

‘Down further at Hatteras people
surf all year and you meet some really
unusual people here if you’re just
willing to talk to ’em. Some guys we

Gallery centralizes culture

Chambers Banquet Hall now features
‘Selections from the Permanent Collection’.
The Banquet Hall, formerly serving at the
location for a variety of miscellaneous gather-
ings, has undergone a transformation. One
steps into a very different atmosphere from
before: now there is a restrained, quiet
elegance.

One wall displays the older prints, begin-
ning with a notable Albrecht Durer engraving
entitled ‘‘The Ravisher’’ from 1495. The list of
notable artists continues, with a Rembrandt,
‘The Death of the Virgin”, 1639, a scene from
Goya’s ‘‘Disasters of War’’, and a lithograph
by Honore Daumier. Camille Corot, Toulouse-
Lautrec, and an interesting balcony scene (at
the opera?) with persons in various stages of
attention and inattention, as well as an
intaglio in pastels by Jules Pascin, completes
this side.

The other walls of the gallery display a
variety of prints—mgst are prize-winning
selections from the Davidson National Print
and Drawing Competition. Two especially
striking prints are ‘‘Dutch Detail’, a colorful
silkscreen of a Dutch burgher and his wife and
a self-portrait by Raphael Soyer which shows
the drawn features of an aging man, his eyes

fixed by a dull vacancy. The tone in all the
prints ranges from a bold black and white to a
delicate shading as in the intaglio ‘‘Mist on
Mountain” by Martha Lynn Duncan.

The lighting in the gallery is very effective.

“Furniture as Art’’, which will be here through
February 18. There are a relatively few simple
pieces of furniture: two benches, a music
stand, a table, a couch, and a stool. The
amount of space separating one piece from the
others dramatizes the beauty of each; inviting
one to look from all angles.

Not only the symmetry of the pieces but also
the intentional curves and irregularities em-
phasize the artistry of the work. Most striking
is the way Kopf has exposed the grain of the
wood, allowing these patterns to decorate each
piece.

The significance of the gallery is its location:
in the mainstream of things. For the first time
at Davidson there is an opportunity for
repeated exposure to good art without
elaborate preparation and inconvenience. Per-
sons at Davidson can now spend odd moments
in the gallery as part of their routine.

Note: The hours of the gallery are 10 am to 5
pm weekdays and 2 to 5 pm on Saturday and
Sunday afternoons.
