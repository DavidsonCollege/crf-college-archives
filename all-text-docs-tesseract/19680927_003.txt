The Big Changes

This summer I was moat fortunate to be it Charlotte ond
to listen to the raclio’s humon talking machine, Jim Beatty,
He and his "Big WAYS Sports’ program continned to en-
Highton me as to various changes in Davidson athleties,

When driving into Davidson laxt Wednesday for my fourth
and final year at this “Princeton of the South,’ 1 began won-
dering If anything hod really changed in the college sprots
scene, Like most things at Davidson, it hasn't that much.

Despite the fact thal we now attend school an the qunrler
system and work under the new curriculum changes made last
year, the basic and old tradition of Davidson lives on. Still
there is po drinking on campus, no girls in the dorms, and the
football team doesn’t win the first garg,

The non-subsidized [all sports still struggle froward trying.
to win on desire alane against scholarship athletes Erom other
schools. Everybody gives the cross-country runners moral
support for doing something they know they couldn’, stand
themselves. Typically, only two members of the soccer tenm
showed up a week before school tu begin pre season practice
whieh the team unanimously wanted last spring. And the base-
bull team is working out this full trying to figure out a way to
win without really trying,

All the fraternities are beginning to think obout trtramurals
and finding a flickerball team frotn among the membership.
hese players then have to find 1 way to appear to-be in shape
without saerifiee. The Froshmen will try lo organize hall teams
for intramural sports and only ‘one tcam will show up for the
games. Golf and tennis will be popular among the higher clays
as 0 gentleman's way lo exerciae in Lhe fall and the hunters
will take to the waads and ponds to find dove, duck or any-
thing else that moves. Whal they find will be shot and then
given to some farmer to cook,

The frisbee season will bexin among those. who Iike the
Uimid sports, although former President D. Grier Martin will
be missedl in that it was hix honor to fling out the first platter.
Some old guard anglers will cast their lines in a shallow and
muddy Lake Norman only to find themselves being run down
by the water skling enthusiasts or some rookie sailing captain.

Poselbly the now defunct sport of water fighting will be
revived although Scotty Nicholls has installed rigid rules which
make It almost impossible to find a place to perform. The
treshmen wil wonder sbout our football team and the uppur-
classmen will just laugh. And ihen everyone will wait and
wonder about basketball season.

Despite evidence that change comes xlowly in Davidson
athletics there are occasional brenkthroughs. This yenr the
football team schoduled games with Vanderbilt and Virginia,
two schools that have better football programs than we do or
spend more money on them. There is an advantage to playing
better teams. Our players have nothing to lose but the game
which they probably will if last week Itinsco with Bucknell
is any indicntion, ° f

Sam Sponcer, the new president. is ch . Everyone {rom
‘the janitors to the faculty are wondering what he really thinks
about subsidized athletics at Davidson. It appenrs that he,
like most decision makers at Davidson, prefer to remain non-
committal for a year or two,

Even the inteamural organization tras changed somewhat
although the pinyers are just aa rude. This year officials will
be paid $2 a game and they might get the money before they
graduate,

Seltt, despite changes in sports and other facets of college

Lack of Overall Attack
Leads To Grid Demise

By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Writer
lf Davidson can make both
ends meet Lomerrow night

Against Richmond, there may

be some surprises.

However, the Wildcats.
must overcome several
weaknesses that were appar-
ent in last week's opening
22.13 loss to Bucknell.

First, the charges ot Coach
Homer Smith must play the
middle of the game with the
euse in which they played
the opening and closing mo.
ments.

Against Bucknell the Wild-
ents scored with ease in the
first quarter and once ngain
in’ the fourth period but
were unable to pose any real
threat in the middle of the
game.

Second, nnother
running back must be found
to give Davidson a good
ground attack. ‘Kerry Keith
picked up 63 yarda in 12 car-
ries but received no sub
stantial help fram
else.

Third, the offensive and
@efensive unils must play
with more cohesion against
the Spiders, “We just weren't

well, but that will come with
practice. And when it does
we'll wih a Jew ball games,

The Wildcats rolled up 270
wards total offense, most of
it on the passing of junior
Gordon Slade and Keith’s
plunges,

Keith scored both of David.
son's touchdowns, his. first
capping a 7$-yatd drive the
‘gacond time the Wildcats had
the ball. Then disaster
atruck, and in the most un-
usual ways,

The frustrated Davidson
team saw first an Ed Terry
field goal try hit the cross-
bar and bounce back, and
then watched as Whit Mor
row fumbled a kickoff at a

crucial moment in the game.

“If we had had a better
kicking game. a better offen.
,aive effort, or a better de.
fensive game, any of these
three would have won the
game for us.‘ Smith said.

There won't be much
change in the Davidson per-
sonnel tomorrow despite last
woek's poor showing. Junior
George Hannen. a converted
halfback who played end last
year, will see limited action
after missing the Bucknell
Game with sicknezs, while
another junior, halfback Ken
Hill, was hurt last week and
wool be able to start,

“Our opponent will be bet-
ser this week, but so will we,
We definitely will play a bet-
tet game,” Smith said.
