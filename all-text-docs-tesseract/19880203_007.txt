without changing expression, he
looks down at his shoes, and then
off into the horizon. His habitual
gestures, although demonstrating
all thecuteness ofa button, are fast
becoming stale.

Aaron Altman is often the
comic element. As a child prod-
igy, graduating valedictorian
from his high school in Boston at
the age of fifteen, he earns the
disrespect of his fellow graduates
by forgiving them for their hatred
of him. As a mature reporter in
Washington. he takes the news
business seriously. He is a fluent

location, with whom she shares
her secrets, with whom she fights
against ignorant, uninformed re-
porting. Despite all his warings
she falls in love, or more likely, in

lust with the newcomer, who

couldn’ tgivealick about the news
beyond how he looks in front of
the cameras.

Her struggle to maintain her
ideals in the face of her affections
places her in a position in which
she must choose one man or the
other. Like Wordsworth’s Mi-
chael, she looks adversity in the
eye and carries on. Holly Hunter,
fresh from her role in Raising Ari-
zona, proves that she can act seri-
ously as well as comically.

I liked it, I really, really liked it.

Idon’t understand why itreceived
such a horde of Oscar nomina-
tions. Had it been about any other
form of journalism the critics
would not have loved it so dearly.
But it touched upon an area and a
livelihood which affects many of
those most influential in the
movie industry; thus the plethora |
of accolades. Nonetheless, I
thought Broadcast News earned
one or two nominations. I cannot
report on the readings of the HPS
meter because either the batteries
ran down or there weren’t enough
vulgar actions to warrant its work-
ing. But I can offer my personal
opinion, and suggest that you see
Broadcast News before it vacates
Charlotte theaters.
