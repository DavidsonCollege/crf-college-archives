SWIMMERS DOING GREAT

The winningest team on the Davidson campus at the
present time is the varsity swimming squad, which now boasts
a 5-0 record for the season. After winning their opening meet
against Eastern Carolina, the Cat tankers have swept past
The Citadel, Eastern again, South Carolina, and Wofford in
rapid succession. The Wofford meet last Tuesday produced
the widest margin of the year, 66-18.

The swimmers are off to Clemson today and hit Emory
in Atlanta tomorrow afternoon. Victory in these two meets
will keep the swimmers’ record unblemished, with only two
more meets remaining on the schedule before the Southern
Conference meet.

The site of the 1955 Southern Conference Swimming
Meet has been moved from V.M.I. to Davidson and will be
held here on February 24, 25, and 26. It will be a real treat
for local students since they will have the opportunity to see
some of the best swimmers in the area, and the fast com-
petition should produce a fine meet.

The host Wildcat team will be a strong contender for
Conference honors this season since the added strength of the
freshman squad of 1954 has given the Cats the depth needed
in past seasons.

HATS OFF

This week, The Davidsonian hat is tipped to Coach Pete
Whittle for the fine job he is doing as Acting Athletic Director.
When the resignation of Paul Scott left the position vacant
last October, Whittle was asked to assume the director’s duties
until a new man could be selected by the Trustees. Pete
added these chores to the many already held in the track
department, and he has handled the load in fine fashion. The
Davidson coaching staff has been pleased with the manner
in which the position has been run, and the coaches haven't
hesitated to give Whittle their full support.

The task of keeping things in shape until a new director
can be selected is probably harder than the permanent di-
rector’s position since few definite policies can be adopted
during this period, and only a very able man could do a job
which could be considered better than average. Coach Whittle
has done it, and we extend hearty congratulations on a jot
well done.

To the other coaches also goes a lot of credit. With Tom
Fetzer, Elgin White, and Mr. Scott having left for other pas-
tures, the Davidson coaches have had to do double duty this
year. Each man has had to be on the job in two different de-
partments or more, and the coaching staff
to keep everything moving at the usual speed.

Davidson Cagers
Hit Furman Again
On Next Thursday

By LEON HOWELL
Furman’s Purple Paladins are
hosts to the Davidson hoopsters
next Thursday night, Feb. 17.
After playing Furman last night
here, the Cats will probably have
their fill of Darrel Floyd and crew
by the end of that evening.
It will be necessary for David-
son to halt the rapid-fire scoring
habits of Furman, now averaging
97.5 points per game. Part of the
drama will be in the tactics David-
son employs in attempting to halt
Floyd, the nation’s leading scorer.
Last Friday night in Johnston
Gym, the Cats once again were
made to believe the old adage, “A
good big man is better than a good
little man.” Washington and Lee,
a rapidly improving club, sent out
a starting five that averaged six
feet, two inches. Davidson, forced
to fire from the outside against
the tight defense employed, was
unable to hit. Both backboards
were controlled by W&L, an there-
in lay the victory formula.
High scoring Hobby Cobb,
guarded closely by taller oppo-
nents, was held to 16 points. . Ray
Harding contributed 13 to the
losing cause, while the very
promising freshman, Mike Martin,

game. Mike garnered 10 of his
points in a display of accuracy
from the foul line. Storick and
Flora headed the well-balanced
W&L attack with 14 each.

Saturday night was more enjoy-
able for the Wildcat boosters. In
a very exciting battle, Davidson
pulled a victory out in the last

ing a comfortable lead in the first

over as the Davidson swimmers get set for the Southern Conference
Tournament here on February 24, 25, and 26.

Babbling Brooks

On Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Feb. 24, 25, and 26,

the Davidson Wildcats will be the hosts for the Southern Con-

ference Swimming Meet. There is expected to be a good rep-
resentation combined with a high spirit of competition for the
Conference crown. Prior to the Conference meet, there will

be two individual meets here in
the next two weeks—one with
V.P.I. and one with Washington
and Lee. These will be prior to
the Conference Meet, so if you
are interested in Davidson’s wel-
fare in marine competition, get
down to the pool and back the
“Cat-fish.” ’

In indoor track last week, Da-
vidson pulled a 50-50 split ‘at the
Virginia Relays at Lexington. The
60-yard spring relay team came
in fourth against nine good teams,
of which the top three were:
V.M.1., Duke and Maryland. In the
shot-put division, Davidson's three
entries could not qualify due to
unknown reason of just plain lock-
ing up. Next week when Davidson
sends nearly a full team to the
Southern Conference Indoor Meet,
a better showing will be expected
from all participants, due to con-

This reporter would like to take
& moment aside to express an
opinion. After the Washington and
Lee basketball game, I was talking
to one of the W&L players who
lives in the same area from which
I come. During the course of our
pleasant conversation, he asked
how I liked this school. I told him
I was well-satisfied. Now naturally
this was a mistake, for at that
moment a fellow-Davidsonian was

passing us and dropped this com-] °

ment in retaliation to mine—“You
are lying like hell!” I have but
one thing to say about this in-
cident. It was a poor impression
made on a guest. If a boy doesn't
like this school, then may I say
that he is quite free to leave. This
is an impersonal observation, and

By NEO PAYNE

Davidson’s swimming team carries a five win-no loss record into competition this week-
end, travelling to Clemson tonight and to Emory tomorrow. To date the Cats have posted
wins over East Carolina twice, by 61-23 and 60-24, over South Carolina by 55-28, and in
a close one, 45-39, over The Citadel.

Winter Track Squad
Now Working To Be
Ready for S.C. Meet

By CHARLES McGIRT

Coach Heath Whittle and his
fifteen winter runners have been
putting in long hours in prepara-
tion for the Southern Conference
indoor track meet. This meet is
open to all teams which are mem-
bers of the Southern Conference
and will be held at V.MI. in Lex-
ington, Virginia, on February 19th.
When asked about the contest
which will be held this month,
Coach Whittle said, “My boys are
looking good.”

The events which will be entered
are as follows: the mile, the sixty-
yard relay, the high hurdles, the
low hurdles, high jump, broad
jump with three men, and the
quarter mile run made up of three
men. All of the boys seem to be in
good shape and it is predicted that
the Davidson team will make a
good showing. The local boys will
be competing with many schools
of this section, most of which are
about the same size.

Immediately following this meet,
the Wildcats will take in the At-
lantic Coast Conference meet. The
ACC meet is scheduled for the
25th of February and is to be held
at Carolina. This will be com-
petition with the larger schools
of the eastern seaboard such as
Maryland, Carolina and N.C, State.

Correction

Last week’s issue was quoted as
giving Neil Gordon a total of nine
points when Furman played David-
son here two years ago. After re-
checking the record book, it was
discovered that Gordon only hit
for 7 points.

and that’s the part they ask

you on the final exam...

This year’s Davidson swimming
squad is the largest in the team’s
history. Coach Hambright said the
entire squad is working hard, and
he is especially impressed with the
freshmen, who are in-experienced

but have shown a strong will to

improve.

Captain Al Ormond continues
his fine career after leading the
team as individual high scorer for
the past three years. He has turned
in some fine performances to date,
along with sophomore Bill Carrell.
Coach Hambright is also pleased
with the fine improvement shown
by Alex Shephard and Frank
Kiker. Both boys have been work-
ing hard to improve their time.

The squad consists of: Roger
Bates in the. diving and sprints,
“Chuck” Blake in the distances,
Bill Carrell in the distances and
individual medley, John Edwards
in the breast stroke, Frank Kiker
in the back stroke, Bob Oliver in
the distances, Curt Ormond in
diving and medley, Al Ormond in
the distances and back stroke,
Larry Parrott in the distances,
Stafford Query in the sprints, Tom
Rivers in the sprints, Basil Sharp
a diver and sprinter, Alex Shep-
hard in the distances, Ed Spier in
the sprints, Jim Travis in the
breaststroke, Jeff Smith a diver,
John Winfrey in the sprints, and
Charles Stowe in the breast stroke.
Managers are Carl Bitter, Fred
Brandt and Dick Morehead.

The remainder of the schedule
has meets with VPI on the 14th,
Washington and Lee on the 18th,
and the Southern Conference Meet
on February 24-25-26.

The Southern Conference Meet
will be held at the Davidson pool
this year, and Coach Hambright
expects his squad to make a fine
showing. Last year Davidson
finished only two points out of
second place in the conference
meet, and this year the tankmen

are out to do battle for the Con:

ference trophy.

CAT GRAPPLERS
TO HIT CITADEL

By JOHN JOHNSON

The Wildcat matmen meet The
Citadel here in Johnston Gym Sat-
urday night with the first match
beginning at 7:30 p.m. This will
be the Cats’ last home contest of
the current season. —

The Citadel has a tough team
that is holding a good record. They
have suffered only one defeat, and
that one was to highly-regarded
North Carolina State. Among other
victories, they have defeated V.M.L
by a score of 24 to 8. V.M.I. downed
the Cats 18-15 in the first match
of the season, so Davidson is ex-
pecting a hard contest tomorrow
night.

The Wildcat grapplers have been
working for the meet under Coach
Parker’s directions. The team
members will be changed in two
positions. Ritzell Snider will not
be in the competition tomorrow
night, but his departure from the
line-up is only temporary. David
Burns, who wrestled heavyweight
in some of the earlier matches.
graduated at the semester and is
no longer with the team. Three
members of the eight-man team are
freshmen. The three are Bill War-
lick, David Fagg, and Henry Grif-
fin. Buxton, the team captain, has
not been defeated yet and will
probably add another victory to his
list tomorrow.

The wrestlers that will see action
against The Citadel are:
