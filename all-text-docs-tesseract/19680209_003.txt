Martin Seeks
Delegate Post

Dr. James G. Martin has
been nominated as a dele-
gate to the Republican na-
tional convention in Miami
this summer.

Two delegates from this
area will be elected at the
district meeting tomorrow.
Martin is currently chairman
of the Mecklenburg County
Board of Commissioners.

Martin first became in-
volved in party politics two
years ago when he was a
precinct delegate to the coun-
ty convention from David-
son. After being approached
by the county organization.
Dr. Martin led four Republi.
cans to victory in the previ.
ously all-Democratic Board of
County Commissioners elec-
tion.

When asked whom he would
support at the convention.
Martin replied that as of
now, he personally favored
former Vice-President Rich-
ard M. Nixon. ‘‘However,”
Martin added, “I will pledge
my support to the man with
the best possibility of win-
ning. Nixon will have to

shake his ‘loser’ image.”

“Since North Carolina has
no primary election,’’ Mar-
tin remarked, “‘there is no
restriction on my vote as of
yet." Martin added, howev.
er, that his vote could be
committed by the executive
board at the district meeting
on Saturday.

lounge of the College Union
at 10 p.m. Wednesday to an-
swer any questions from stu-
dents and to discuss current
issues facing the college.

Watson added that one of
the trustees who lives in
Charlotte might -be present
for the meeting.

The meeting was original-
ly scheduled for December.
but it was cancelled when
Davidson President D. Grier
Martin had to go to the hos.
pital for a series of tests.
Martin was not invited to the
meeting this time because
the council feared discussion
might center upon the rea-
sons for his forthcoming re-
tirement as president.

“The emphasis will prob-
ably be on the new curric-
ulum,.”” Watson said, ‘‘but
such topics as chapel policy.
open dorms and the drinking
rule are also fit subjects for
discussion.”

He termed the meeting ‘‘an
excellent opportunity for bad
ly needed contact between
the students and the admin-
istration."’ He also said he
was making every effort to
persuade one of the trustees
to attend the meeting ‘‘to
promote a closer relationship
between the students and
those who ultimately make
policy governing students’
lives.’

Pledge ' GOP Politician Blasts LBJ,

Explores Republican Scene

By BOB TRAVERS
Assoclate Editor

With the politician’s pleas-
ant smile and studied eva-
siveness, SAE ‘Blow Up"
speaker Robert Bonitati spec-
ulated about Richard Nixon's
presidential chances, gloated
over President Johnson's
credibility gap and analyzed
some of the important factors
of a modern political cam-
paign. He spoke at a press
conference at the College Un-
ion Tuesday.

Obviously enjoying himself,
the northeast regional direc.
tor of the National Republi-
can Congressional Committee
listed an increasing crime
rate, ghetto problems and
riots, and President John-
son's personality as the fac-
tors most likely to bring
about a change of adminis-
tration in November.

He predicted Richard Nix
on would. win the New Hamp
shire primary in March in
spite of an unexpectedly im-
pressive showing by George
Romney. but added that the
question of whom the Repub
licans will nominate would be
unanswered until the conven-
tion meets in Miami in July.

He would not rule out Nel.
son Rockefeller as a possible
candidate and refused to
evaluate the importance of
primary victories in Nixou's
fight for the nomination.

The husky, personable Bo.
nitati, whose domain is 123
congressional districts in the
northeast, especially those
held by Democrats, said his
principal interest in the preés-
idential campaign is in the
effect it will have on. con
gressional campaigns.

“Many practical politicians
(Democrats) are afraid to
have Johnson come into their
states to campaign’ for the
adverse affect he would have
on local political races. he
said.

He went on to say that this
year more and more con.
gressional campaigns will be

conducted by methods which,

have—not -been—used-—in the
past.

For instance, he listed the
computer which allows much

more efficient

agement firms as important
innovations in the modern
political campaign.

Bonitati explained that: his
principal function in cam.
paigns is to recruit potential
candidates and assist them
once they have been nomi-
nated. ‘‘We try to stay out of
nomination fights,"’ he said.

In recruiting, ‘‘we are look-
ing for articulate, attractive,
young candidates who ap-
proach problems with a solu-
tion in mind.” Bonitati said.
“We need problem-solvers."

He emphasized the young
aspect of potential candidates
as especially important. as,
he said, “‘young candidates
attract youthful voters and
are not hampered by tradi-
tions and old ties."

The emergence of such
young candidates will prob-
ably result in a ‘pragmatic

Plans Filed
For ROTC
Next Year

Col. .Frederick B. Outlaw,
commander of the ROTC de-
partment, reported Tuesday
that he had made recommen
dations to Dean of the Fac.
ulyt Frontis Johnston as to
the handling of ROTC next
year under the Blue Sky pro.
gram:

“The ROTC department has
made proposals to the Fac:
ulty Educational Policy Com-
mittee and will work out a
program .to fit Blue Sky as
far as the three-termed cal.
endar is concerned." said
Outlaw.

Outlaw was hesitant about
revealing his recommenda.
tions and called Dean John
ston to find out whether the
proposais had been consid
ered.

Rush Successful

Staff Writer

Interfraternity Council
President Gus Cochran said
this week a “good attitude"
on the part of fraternities
contribute to the success of
Rush Week.

“It was basically a good
rush and a good attitude.”
Cochran said, in summing up
last week's activities that re-
sulted in the pledging of 230
rushees.

Mechanically, rush ran
smoothly, although some un
necessary meetings were held
which may be omitted next
year, Cochran said.

Cochran said he had no-
ticed a more open attitude
about bidding. He felt the
fraternities this year showed
more concern for the rushee

Geophysicist States Theory
About Continental Drift

By DAVE MORROW
Staff Writer

Dr. James Dorman of the
Lamont Geophysical Observ-
atory presented three lec-
tures here Tuesday on ‘The
Earth's Upper Mantle — The

Geologic Active Layer.”
His principal lecture was
delivered at an open meeting
of Sigma Pi Sigma at 7 pm
Tuesday in the Dana Science
Building. He spoke about the
theory of continental drift,
one of the more popular and
spectacular ideas of geo-

logical research.

Speculation of continental
drift became popular when
scholars realized the jigsaw-
puzzle fit of the coastline of
South America-and Africa.

Some speculate that the
seven continents were at one
time a single land mass.

The mechanism contribut-
ing to this drift may be found
in the mid-Atlantic where a
system of rifts and faults
exist, Dr. Dorman said. Their
presence indicates that the
ocean floor is spreading

apart, he said. Furthermore.
higher temperatures in that
vicinity indicate that warm
rocks from below the earth's
crust are pushing upward
and eventually forming new
crust.

Dr. Dorman illustrated his
discussion with slides show-
ing the devastation caused
by the Alaskan earthquake.

The lectures were sponsored
by Sigma Pi Sigma. the
physics honorary society and
the American Geophysical
Union.

becoming a part of the fra-
ternity.

This was accompanied by
a declining interest in pledg-
ing rushees just because they
were “‘slick’’, Cochran said.

Rushing during the week
was largely within the rules.
he said, except during the
periods of silence. There
were numerous violations of
silence by use of the tele.
phone, he said.

Cochran said the extended
rush program is working sat-
isfactorily at this point. Of
the 34 rushees who did not
get bids, about 25 have ac-
cepted the alternative of ex
tended rush.

Fraternity presidents plan-
ned to see these men individ.
ually this week to explain the
opportunities open to them
during the extended rush
period.

The IFC will evaluate this
year's rush and make rec
ommendations for its im
provement in future years.
The extended rush program
will also be evaluated. This
is in line with the require-

ments for evaluation includ- |{

ed in the extended rush legis-
lation drafted by the chapter
presidents last September.
Dr. W. G. Workman, chair.
man of the faculty commit.
tee on the College Union.
Fraternities and Clubs. said
that his committee would
evaluate the extended rush
throughout the semester.
