THE C. E. GRAHAM PROFES-
SORSHIP OF EDUCATION.

Realizing the growing demand for
well trained teachers, and desiring
to offer courses specially designed
to fit young men to take a position
of leadership in the teaching pro-
fession, Davidson has added to its
curriculum, the Department of Edu-
cation and Psycho ony.

The courses in lucation are
divided into two groups. (1) Those
concerned with the problems of in-
struction and (2), those relating to
administration. The problem of in-
struction is, on the one side scientific
—-what are the laws of learning, and
on the other it is one of art—how
may these laws of psychology be
made applicable to the task of train-
ing and discipline. The student will
be expected to have had one year of
formal psychology and will be
directed in selecting those principles
he has acquired, which are of special
value in conducting a_ recitation.
Since the subject of instruction is
the child and youth, there will be a
course dealing especially with the
psychology of childhood and ,adoles-
cence, as distinguished from adult
psychology. The laws of mental and
physical growth will be studied and
attention given to their correlation.

The probtem of school administra-
tion is twofold. (1) Those principles
that concern school finance, build-
ings, class organization, supervision,
qualifications of a teacher and super-
vision of health and play. (2) Ac-
quaintanceship with the school law
of North Carolina.

._ As part of the work of the chair
of Education there will be given
instruction in general psychology.
The first part of the year will be
introductory. The student will aim
to get a clear conception of the
problems of psychology, its meth,
ods, and technique. He will become
acquainted with the elementary
facts of mental life, and be able to
differentiate between structural,
functional and behavioristic psychol-

ogy.
eThe last part of the year a more
detailed study will be given to some
special field of psychology. The in-
struction will be by text book, lec-
ture readings, and reports will also
be part of thé work. The aim of the
course throughout will be to furnish
the student with that intelligent
knowledge of the science of psychol-
ogy which will be useful in direct-
ing his subsequent studies in this
field or applying his knowlede to
practical problems of law, medicine,
salesmanship or social betterment.

DEPARTMENT OF FRENCH.

Davidson, like other colleges and
universities, is trying to provide
efficient instruction for the large
numbers of students crowding into
the department of French these tat-
ter times. The past year, first year
French was taught in four sections,
and will be taught again if neces-
sary. The utmost effort is made to
give vitalit
substantial demands are made on the
student as to application and time.
Two years in French classes at
Davidson should enable the student
to take care of himself in France, or
to handle French books with facili
in his graduate of professional wor
at any American university.

It is very essential that every stu-
dent, both old and new, be present
at the very first meeting of the class
and be sure to get an even start with
those who mean business. In scarce-
ly any other branch does late ar-
rival handicap a student so severely
as in foreign language. If the stu-
ent will bring a mind, a tongue, an
ear, and a pen, all in good working
condition during the coming session
we are sure commendable inroads
will be made on one of the finest
languages and literature the world
has ever. known.

As now provided in Davidson’s
schedule, young men entering col-
lege can begin Greek just as they
begin the modern languages an
have it count as a college credit to-
ward graduation.

Greek 1 will cover a Beginner's
Greek book and one Book of the
Anabasis, part of this latter possibily
being read out of class, as there are

‘only three recitations in Greek 1

to the teaching, and fi

now as against five a few years ago.

Greek 2 marks a progressive
study of the language, with special
emphasis on Greek words in English,

while Greek 3 and Greek 4 (Class- Vol

ical Greek) may be described as in
like measure progressive and ex-
tensive in compass, introducing the
student to Plato and Demosthenes
or Thucydides in the first term res-
pectively and to the Greek: dramat-
ists in the second.

New Testament Greek as an alter-
nate to Greek 3 is designed more
especially to meet the needs of can-
didates for the ministry, but, as a
study of the Greek New Testament
and its peculiarites in word forma-
tion and syntax involve an emphasis
on the normal or standard form and
construction in classical Greek, the
course is of almost equal value to
the general student of Greek.

Greek 6 may be characterized in a
word as a study of the history of
Greek literature (Jebb’s Primer)
illustrated at length with readings
(and analysis) in English translation
of the Greek masterpieces from
Homer through the Anthology.
While an acquaintance with the
Greek language is not a requisite
for admission to this class some
rather liberal acquaintance with
English literature is assumed_for
those offering for the course. Two
or three years study of the Greek
preparation for Greek 6.

All Greek this year will be taught
by Dr. Harding.

POLITICAL SCIENCE.

In the department of Political
Science the following courses will
be given:

1. Elements of Law—This is a
practical law course, not designed to
train lawyers, but for the average
citizen. It is a study of the origin
and development of the common law
and principles of equity. <A brief
study is made of Crimes, Torts and
Domestic Relations, Special atten-
tion is devoted to. Contracts and
Commercial Law in the Spring term.

2. Political Science 1 — This
course furnishes an introduction to
the study of Political Science, its re-
lation to other social sciences, the
origin and development of the State,
and governmental forms. In the
Spring term a comparative study of
the Governments of Europe is made,
special attention being paid to Eng-
and.

3. Political Science I1.—In this
course the Fall term is devoted to a
study of State Constitutions and
Governments. The Spring term is
devoted mainly to a study of Inter-
national Law. Those who take it
should have previously had either
Elements of Law or Political
Science I.

4. Economics I introduces the
student to the very broad and im-
portant field of Economics. Its aim
is to furnish an outline of the sub-
ject—to give the student an ac-
quaintance with economic terms,
and to suggest to his mind some of
the more important problems of the
eld.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.

Physical examination of the stu-
dents will begin as soon as the rolls
are completed. This will enable us
to eliminate the new men who are
not physically qualified for R. O. T.
C. and have them placed in a train-
ing class under Coach Grey.

While compulsory vaccination is
not a requirement for entrance to
Davidson College, it is a wise plan
for each student to have both the
typhoid vaccination and the small

ox vaccination before entering col-
lege. To those desiring, however,
these vaccinations are given with-
out charge after entering college.

MATHEMATICS.

Mathematics I will commence
with College Algebra and will later
take up Plane and Spherical Trigo-
nometry. Entrance conditions now

d|require students to have completed

Solid Geometry in addition to those
requirments heretofore existing.
This course will be taught in four
sections by Professors Douglas,
Currie and Wood. Other courses in
Mathematics will be practically the
same as last year.

FACULTY NOTES.

Dean M. E. Sentelle had the
month of June as his vacation, which
he spent with home folks at Green-
ville, Tenn. Since July Ist he has
been actively engaged in the duties
connected, with his new office.

Professor Currie has been study-
ing at Cornell University. Post cards
bearing the picture and postmark of
Niagara Falls have been received in
Davidson from Mrs. Currie and the
children. The high price of gaso-
line evidently has not interfered
with his mixing some pleasure with
hard work.

Dr. and Mrs. J. M. Douglas are
at Montreat this summer. As fac-
ulty representative on athletics Dr.
Douglas has been very much inter-
ested in the prospects for football
and has been in frequent communi-
cation with Coach Grey.

«

Dr. Harding has been in Davidson
and Charlotte for most of the time.
He, accompanied by Prof. J. L.
Douglas, had a pleasure trip to De-
troit during July. The trip te De-
troit was made on the train.

Dr. Arbuckle’s summer address
has been Lewisburg, W. Va., where
he has been rendering valuable as-
sistance in reorganizing Lewisburg
Seminary. We are glad he did not
accept the work permanently when
it was offered to him last spring.
Refore returning to Davidson, Dr.
Arbuckle’s family has planned a mo-
tor trip that will include Philadel-
phia, Baltimore and Washington.

Professor and Mrs. Wood are at
Lewisburg also.

Dr. Grey, vice-president of the
college, has been in Davidson for
the most part. The monotony of
home life was broken by a vacation
trip to Hendersonville, points in
east Tennessee, etc.

” Dr. Thomas W. Lingle is profes-
sor of Mediaeval and Modern Euro-
pean History in the Summer Quar-
ter of the University of Virginia.

Mrs. Lingle, with her mother and
other relatives, is on a motor trip
up the Hudson and through the Adi-
rondacks. Miss Sarah is visiting
school friends in Norfolk.

Dr. J. M. McConnell, with Joe,
Riggs and John D., is spending the
summer at Camp Sapphire, Brevard.

Dr. John W. MacConnell, with
Davidson as headquarters, has taken
several extended pleasant motor
trips. Courtney is attending the last
term of Camp Sapphire.

Dr. E. F. Shumake is again teach-
ing English at the Summer Quarter
of the-University of Virginia. At its
recent commencement, U. of Vir-
ginia conferred the Ph.D. degree on
Dr. Shewmake. The students, fac-
ulty and trustees will wish to unite
in congratulating Dr. Shewmake on
securing this degree.

Dr. C. M. Richards is taking his
vacation during August. This time
he is spending with his family at
Montreat.

Prof. M. H. Hunt and family have
occupied the residence of Professor
Wood during the summer. Mrs.
Hunt and Miss Priscilla spent some
days at Montreat.

Miss Shaw has been quite busy
completing material for the history
of Davidson College and has gone
to Crisp Inn, Sapphire, N. C., for a
breathing spell before the opening
of college.

Miss Steele’s vacation was taken
in June and was spent at Valdosta,
Ga., and Montreat, N. C.

Coach H. M. Grey is studying
Science and Tactics of Athletics at
the University of Wisconsin. He
will have a full line of dope to in-
ject into the Wildcats when practice
begins September Ist. Look out A.
& E., Ga. Tech., Washington & Lee,
et sequentia !

Miss Thompson, except for short
visits to Charlotte and Statesville,
has been at her usual duties in the
treasurer's office.

Miss Dorothy Finlayson was call-
ed to Lumberton for a few days.

Coach Hengeveld will be principal
of the Davidson Graded School and
will be on hand to put “brains” into
the baseball and basketball teams

again.

Welcome

Dr. E. A. Byers, Professor of
Spanish and German.

Prof. Edward J. Erwin, Professor
of English.

Dr. Frazer Hood, Professor of
Education and Psychology, Profes-
sor of Military Science and Tactics.

THE LAUNDRY.

The brick building for the laun-
dry is practically completed.: Some
of the machinery has been in stock
since before college closed. Other
parts have been arriving since.
There are certain essential parts,
hewever, that we have been unable
to obtain, but are promised ship-
ment of these August 5th. Mr. H.
P. Helper will be in charge of the
laundry and he is now spending
some time in one of the Charlotte
laundries preparatory to assuming
his new work. There will be sev-
eral men in the Freshman class who
have had considerable experience in
laundry work, who will be engaged
tu help in the work from time to
time.

Co-operation of the students is re-
quested in the marking of the
clothes. All marking will be done
by numbers and each student -will
be given a number before he leaves
home. You are requested to be
particularly careful not to lose or
misplace your number, but to have
each and every garment marked
with the number which will be fur-
nished you the latter part of Au-
gust. If you do not get a number
before you come to college, you will
get same from the treasurer’s of-

ce.

A number of requests have come
from the new students asking what
they are expected to bring with
them to furnish their rooms. The
college furnishes only the heavy
furniture, chiffonier, table, bed,
springs, mattresses, etc. The col-
lege does not furnish chairs or pil-
lows, but suitable chairs may be
purchased from local stores at rea-
sonable prices.

The old men are reminded and the
new men requested to take note that
no one is allowed to change his room
without first having his name
changed on the records in the treas-
urer’s office. The furniture must
not be moved from one room to an-
other without permission.. An ex-
act record of the equipment in each
room is on file in the college office.
A man’s late arrival is no excuse for
not having mattress or a bed when
he does come.

The college charges provide for
only two electric lights to each
room. The single lamps this year
will be 50 watts instead of 40 watts
as heretofore. Additional or large
amps, pressing irons or electric fans
cannot be allowed. Janitors will be
required to report any variation.

READ THE NEW CATALOGUE.

It is urged that you secure and
tead from cover to cover a copy of
the catalogue for 1919-20 within the
first Week after your return. There
are many changes in the courses
(several new ones being offered)
changes in the absence regulations,
in regard to Junior and Senior Ora-
tions, points necessary for gradu-
ation, etc. Make a memorandum
now to study the catalogue carefully
as soon as you get back.
