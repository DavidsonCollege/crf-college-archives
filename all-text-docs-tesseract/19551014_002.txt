Davidson Spirit

“All hail, oh Davidson, our dear old
alma mater...

One of life’s finest loyalties is found
in a man's relationship to his college. It
is shown by alumni in their donation of
time, abilities, and gifts to their beloved
institution. It is shown by faculty and
friends in their interest and actions. It
should best and most naturally be dis-
played, however, by members of the stu-
dent body. This-loyaity can find no better
outlet of obvious expression than the
football games. :

Throughout the past. one of Davidson’s
outstanding characteristics has been its
spirit. Cheering at the Saturday football
melee was an all-out and continuous effort
in spite of the rather discouraging string
of “moral” victories that attended some of
the teams. It was a full-throated en-
thusiasm that extended for four quarters
and never diminished in vigor. participa-
tion, or degree. It was led by an ever-
yelling corps of cheerleaders who would
lose their voices for the cause before they
lost their interest. It was an effort that
challenged the strongest of opponents and
outstripped any competition from across
the way. Finally, it was a loyalty that
earnestly supported all efforts of its team
on the field whether in victory or defeat
whether on a goal line stand or a.touch-
down pass, whether in a cloudburst or on
a sunny day.

Last year we had a victorious season,
oné of the best in many years. We went
into last week’s game boasting a 2-0
record. And yet there was no “spirit.”
The game began with a mild manner of
cheering. Before the end of the first quar-
ter the upperclassmen had relinquished
the cheering chores to the freshmen. At
the start of the second quarter the frosh
turned in their hats. Before the half the
cheerleaders had laid their megaphones to
rest, and the student body didn’t play the
second half.

The “spirit” of Davidson is an intangi-
ble but cherished tradition. It has as many,
if not more, ingredients of honor and
pride than when it was originated. It was
created by students, continued by them,
and passed on to us in faith and trust.
We as heirs of such a ‘‘spirit’”. would do
well to evaluate “Old Davidson.” observe
the interest and enthusiasm of the alum-
ni, and recapture the “spirit” of old.

It is our challenge and our opportu-
nity. For our forefathers, for Davidson,
and for the team let us accept that chal-
lenge that with due honor, pride, and
volume we may indeed “follow them on
and pledge our loyalty.”

Birth of a Notion

Last Thursday there was a social and
political upheaval on the Davidson cam-
pus. With the spirit of the following
declaration the freshman class rose in
rebellious action.

“We hold these truths to be self-evi-
dent, that all students are created equal,
that they are endowed by their ability
with certain unalienable rights, that
among these are walking on the grass,
being obnoxious, ignoring upperclassmen,
and observing no freshmen regulations
... that whenever any Court of Control
becomes destructive to these ends, it is
the right of the freshmen to alter or
abolish it, and to establish its own govern-
ment, laying its foundation on such prin-
ciples and powers as to them shall seem
most likely to effect by mass action and
hysteria their safety and happiness.”

Having proclaimed this spirit of inde-
pendence, the freshman mass_ tore
through upperclass dorms, ran riot over
campus, burned their hats on the main
square, hooted the cheerleaders, and de-
risively walked out of chapel the next

day. Class struggle has ended in anarchy.
A new social order seems to have been
formed, the upper-freshman.

Where is the humble, low walking,
uninformed, green-eyed frosh of the good
old days before the revolution? How long
Shall the peasants rule? Where is order,
where is law, where is the Court of Con-
trol?—R.H.M.

The Doors Are Open
----For Naught

“When you get what you want, you
don't want it,” say the paradoxical
words of a recent popular tune. Remov-
ing them from their context, we find that
they have a very striking relevance to the
fickleness of the Davidson student body.

Turn to the early issues of last year’s
Davidsonian and notice the persistent
theme of “Away with secrecy in the Stu-
dent Council! Give the students a chance
to see what is going on!” Doubtless, at
that time the writers and possibly the ma-
jority of the student body thought there
was a pretty good case for bringing Stu-
dent Council meetings out into the open.
Important decisions by the Council some-
times become known to students only by
word of mouth and there was little way
of confirming any of the rumors that
might be making the rounds. Surely if
anything was important enough to merit
attention bv the Council, it was important
enough for the students to know about, it
was argued.

But memory is short. Apparently we
have already forgotten the demands of a
year ago. President Perrin Anderson has
made it a policy to have meetings of the
Student Council open to all students. The
cynics may have smiled when he stood be-
fore the student body one day in chapel
and invited the entire group to the Coun-
cil’s next meeting, which was to be held
in the Blue Room of the College Union.
They may have reasoned that he could not
have been expecting many to attend, be-
cause he chose such a small room for the
meeting. Regardless of the expectation
of Anderson or any other student the use
ofa room even so small as the Blue Room
gives ample space for the seating of the
student audience.

Student attendance at the regularly
scheduled meetings so far has averaged
.5 student. No one appeared for the first
meeting on September 26, and only one
person was present at the meeting held
on October 10.

Why the remarkable change in the
climate of opinion? It could have been ex-
pected. on the basis of last year’s de-
mands, that almost the whole student body
would have converged on the meeting
place on alternate Mondays. Instead, one
solitary person has shown up to effect a
token representation of the student body
and thus keep the meeting “open.”

Perhaps the revolution 1s over. Having
forced the Student Council out of the
“smoke-filled rooms” and into the light of
diy, perhaps there is nothing more to fear
from it. Perhaps we can rest easy until
another crisis arises, at which time it will
again become necessary to pick up the
pen and scrawl out an accusation against
the vicious practices of the Council.

But then perhaps not. Since we have
been granted the privilege of seeing the
Council in operation, should we not make
it our duty to attend some meetings on
occasion? Otherwise where is the victory
that we seem to have gained? Whether
the Council meets behind locked doors in
Chambers or with open doors in the Union
will make precious little difference if we
fail to take advantage of the opportunity
provided.

It is to be suspected that we will show
little interest in the affairs of the Coun-
cil until something so dramatic as the dis-
Missal of a wayward student occurs again.
Until that time we cannot afford to waste
our time on the multitude of trivialities
that will be considered. Francois, you do
well to ask, ‘“‘Where are the grips of yes-
teryear?” Who knows?—M.A.C.

A Treatise, Candidly Portraying
Davidsoniana, Past and Present

The regard of the visitor for the
historic tribulations of Davidson
College may be that of so much
dust of antiquity. herein yclept
traditions. Yet, as he looks more
closely at the historic pale, he be-
gins to discern some of the shadowy
beginnings, and he becomes in-
creasingly aware and appreciative
of Davidson's development to what
it is today. (7)

The first glimmer of light to il-
luminate this venerable obscurity is
the birth of the institution itself,
with the formal laying of the cor-
nerstone of the first building on
April 7, 1836.
Classes began in
March of the
following year
with 65 students
attending _lec-
tures in the
homes of the
three professors
and living in
the three origin-

Martin al edifices of

Oak and Elm

Row. Since the limited capacity of
these structures would accommo-
date only 48 students, the faculty
voted to “allow” those 17 young
men who arrived late to build their
own wooden huts, and thus protect
themselves from the elements. Evi-
dently the faculty realized the ar-
duousness of this imposition. for
they later granted to these students
permission to sell their shacks to
new students upon graduation. This
tradition of. graduation was not
added until 1840, when the first
group of educated young men com.
pleted the undergraduate require-
ments and performed favorably in
their public examinations — which
events were always well attended
by the local agricultural element.

It is interesting to note. that the
man to whom the college is a me-
morial tribute. Gen. William Lee
Davidson, received his education at
Queen's Museum in Charlotte. Like-
wise, the descendant of that insti-
tution is the source of a liberal
education for many Davidsonians
of today.

The size of the student body
was increased slightly in 1838, the
year of the first faculty suspension
of a student. His offense was the
unprovocated assault upon a fellow
student, nearly killing him. This
was significant in that the first
hazing practices began with the
first sophomore class. This tradi-
tion grew in zeal, ingenuity, and
intensity until it culminated in
February, 1903, with the revolt of
the entire freshman class. These
70 little Bolsheviks had endured.
paddlings, midnight  shivarees,
“featherings,” and other such ‘“ma-
turing influences” for an entire
semester. and finally retaliated
with a general waikout. Their plan
was to board the train at Cornelius
for Charlotte where they would as-
semble, give their last concerted
yell, have their class picture made
(in compliance with the regulations)
and—go back home to their share-
cropping. However, several profes-

Homecoming Dates’ Verdict on

And Dance Weekends. . . They

Since its inception ten years ago,
the Davidson Dance Weekend has
become a tradition, an institution
a legend. The most vital and
basic ingredients of this institution
are THE GIRLS, who, as have their
predecessors in the past, will flock
to Davidson this weekend from all
over the Southland.

We have always been impressed
with the Girls’ enthusiasm for Da-
vidson in general, and the dance
weekends in particular. They
frankly tell us without coyness or
deliberation that Davidson is their
favorite.

This week in an effort to docu-
ment this enthusiasm we con-
tacted girls from all over the South
who are “veterans” as far as Da-
vidson is concerned, asking them
exactly what they like about David-
son and its festive weekends.

Reprinted below, with thanks to
those concerned, are excerpts
from those replies received in time
for publication. Vive la Weekend!

.

KITTY SUE FAULCONER, Queens:

I feel the wonderful atmosphere
of the Davidson campus and the
friendly spirit of all the boys help

to make each weekend a memora-
ble occasion. Even the usual rainy
‘weather can't dampen the good
times of these three unforgettable
days.

sors overtook them on bicycle and
on muleback, and persuaded the
prodigals to return to their studies,
not to be molested further. Since
that time Davidson has observed its
annual riots over one thing or an-
other, and many students still ob-
serve the rite of the walkout with
a festive pilgrimage every weekend
or so.

One other tradition of that era
is still retained in a small subver-
sive element of our present student
body. The highest honor that could
be bestowed upon a freshman of
the 19th century was that of snuf-
fing out the candles at graduation
exercises. Hence the malfeasant
origin of the “Candlesnuffers” of
today. (sic.)

The Wildcat football team had
its beginnings with intramural rug-
by in 1889. Prof. Schenck’s father
was captain and “center-rush with-
out peer” of that first in a series
of Davidson champions. Intercol-
legiate competition followed in
1898 with a season of moral vic-
tories (we lost both games). Pro-
gress followed in 1900 when the
trustees approved the subsidization
of the first hired coach. In that
year the “Big Red” used the flying
wedge extensively (deceptive little
boogers!) in trampling Ga. Tech,
38 to 6. Duke and State’ College
were other “patsies” on the sched-
ule of this renascent period.

The dance weekend had its in-
ception with the first “legal” dance
held on the campus February 9 and
10, 1945, This momentous restate-
ment of tradition consisted of the
informal dance Friday night with
music by the top bands in the coun-
try through the medium of “the au-
tomatic record machine.” Music for
the Saturday night formal was sup-
plied by John Peddicord's group
from Winston-Salem. The popular
tunes of the day were “Four Leaf
Clover” and “Always.”

Here, too, there is a wealth of
precedent, and we find the first
mention of dancing in the 1838 re-
port of the near-expulsion of one
student, who later became a lead-
ing ministerial figure in N. C. Pres-
byterianism, for alleged dancing.
Later, in the spring of 1898, Win-
throp College sent a Y.W.C.A. dele-
gation to Davidson, and it is writ-
ten that “round games” were en-
joyed by all, until the faculty in-
tervened. The 1905 Junior speak-
ing exercises were likewise visited
by such barbarism, ie., the waltz
and 2-step, and likewise visited by
the faculty. Note that the 1905
junior class was the same bunch of
rabble that created the aforemen-
tioned ruckus?6f 1903 as freshman.
But the social progress committee
of 1945 reports, and we concur,
that the dance weekend is here to
stay, so it is with no mean anticipa-
tion that ye scribe looks forward to
“Big Apple”’-ing his way around
the dance floor tonight to the fran-
tic rhythm of “I'm Looking Over A

Four-Leaf Clover.”

BETTY JOYNER, Sullins:

There is something undescribable
about a dance weekend at David-
son which makes it different from
any other college weekend. The
atmosphere, the big name wands,
the friendliness of all the boys, and
the wonderful times had by all,

make it a memortble occasion to
any girl. Above all, I think it is
the boys who make Davidson
weekends so successful. They seem
to have some special knack for
planning exactly what any girl ex-
pects.

HARRIET MAHAFFEY, Converse

College:

What a difficult question to
answer—"Exactly what do you like
about Davidson?” It is difficult
because the things I like are so
hard to put into words.

All Davidson campus seems alive
with a very prominent indescriba-
ble spirit—maybe it's simply a
general feeling of love. The boys
are among the very finest I've ever
known; there seems to be an awful
lot of concern and love for each
other under all their teasin’ and
carryin’-on! The purely unbelieva-
ble is that they make each girl
feel the weekend would have al-
most folded had she not come—
definitely wanted?!

‘Cause the dances are great and
you have nothing but the very best

Ah, Civilization! . .

The Harrowsof Homecoming... A
Sociological Survey in Miniature

There is something of the eternal
in every Homecoming weekend, but
it is very hard to find. Our annual
celebration of the Feast of the Re-
turn is like nothing else under the
sun, even when you’ understand
“under the sun” to be merely a
figure of speech. To be sure, the
wise man in Ecclesiastes did not
miss the target altogether in in-
cluding our festivities within his
glittering generalities; some of his
descriptions are incredibly pointed
in terms of fraternity pins and
blind dates and the joys and sor-
rows of fifty continuous hours in a
world of alien gender. For these
three days will certainly provide
“A time to every purpose under

heaven...
A time to embrace, and a time to
refrain from embracing .. .
A time to get, and a time to lose;
A time to keep silence, and a time
to speak;
A time to love, and a time to
hate...”
But for the most part Homecoming
is unique and without parallel in
civilized experience.

There is no army in the world
like that which assembles for dress
parade in Richardson Stadium to-
morrow afternoon: the long rows of
clean-shaven, cashmere-sweatered,
fraternity-pinned young men of
privilege, bearing their privilege
on their right arm in a tailored
suit behind an enormous chrysan-
themum. After the dances are over,
not even the immortal six hundred
who rode into the Valley of Death
looked more sternly than the grim
and determined gentlemen of Da-
vidson as they emerge from the
dormitories, blanket firmly rolled
under one arm and eyes toward the
distant hills and the rising sun.
Then there are the weekend's in-
visible men whose Girl is here for
the only time this semester, who

in bands, but just being in such
an atmosphere among so many fine
people means the most to you.
Davidson has many unexplainable
things that will never die.

BECKIE WATSON, Duke:

The presence of girls in class and
around campus is taken pretty
much for granted at my own coed
university. Among the many things
that I like about Davidson’s “big
weekends” is that feeling that all
the ‘Davidson men give each date
of being somebody really special.
The courtesy and friendliness you
show towards us and the exciting
campus-wide and fraternity func-
tions we get to attend make us
all feel like campus queens.

EMILY SAPP, Queens:

It would really be impossible to
say exactly what stands out in my
mind about a dance weekend at
D.C. 1 think the most enjoyable
part is the atmosphere of tradition
that surrounds the Davidson cam-
pus.

The intermission sings “down at
the house,” big name bands, play-
ing phantom at the boarding
house, after dance parties, and
seeing Mrs. Little or Mrs. Thomp-
son waiting up when you arrive
back at the dorm about 3:30 a.m.

But of course the boys—or the
Davidson gentlemen—play the most
important role in making the
weekend a dig success.

like the Arabs steal silently away.

The freshmen come to college
trailing clouds of glory left over
from high school romances, and
not infrequently belong to the best-
looking girls of the weekend. By
the time they are sophomores they
will havé learned the sad and sober-
ing laws of Proximity, and will be-
long to no one. Juniors are above
all the cultivators, and in three

years of. quiet desperation gradual-
ly have evolved a working number
of contacts at Salem and Duke and
Scott. Seniors are men of resigna-
tion and infinite understanding; if
they are not pinned they soon will
be, or they have concluded they
never will be because they prefer
the carefree and hearty masculine
life they have grown to love at Da-
vidson.

So novel-a social situation is the
dance weekend that no really au-
thoritative study of social ethics
for it has ever been worked up. It

Like Us!

PEGGY HAHN, University of Ga.:

It's not hard to explain why
everyone enjoys themselves on a
Davidsonian weekend. The atmos-
phere is filled with excited voices
of people who come from far and
wide to share theire numerous ex-
periences together. The boys treat
their dates as if they were queens,
preparing the campus for another
wonderful weekend of dancing and
informal parties.

Yes, It’s going to be another
fabulous weekend at Davidson Col-
lege and I wouldn't miss it for the
world!

JEAN McLAURIN, Queens:

The most outstanding thing to
me about a Davidson dance week-
end is the happy, carefree atmos-
phere that surrounds the campus—
including the friendliness shown
to the visiting girls by all students,
the well-planned program of enter-
tainment, and the over-all school
spirit which assures everyone of a
good weekend.

A Senior at Hollins, who prefers
to remain anonymous:

Once a girl spends a weekend
at Davidson she wants to come
back, not just to go to a dance or
a fraternity party, but to be with
boys who know the values of
friendship and fun. It’s this spirit
(most of all) that makes each Da-
vidson weekend a memorable occa-
sion.

would require a new type of re.
search worker, whose general ap-
proach would fall somewhere be-
tween Emily Post and Dr. Kinsey,
with a touch of Norman (The
Power of Positive Thinking) Peale.
A great deal of Positive Thinking
goes on during Homecoming, and
various quantities of Negative
Thinking. The retative ratio be.
tween the two generally determines
the success of the weekend for the
Davidson Man, success increasing
directly as Positive predominates
over Negative. (See Graph 32c on
Page 83 of Brandt's fine study
“Three-Six-Nine: Statistical Studies
in Sociognomonenalism"). Dr.
Brandt with a subtle sense of hu-
mor that is rare in ponderous works
of this kind also points out that the
ratio of success varies inversely
with the proportion of the squares
among the escorts. But Dr. Brandt
is a lonely man in his field, and he
has not been able to cover the
wide range of problems raised by

this recent phenomenon, the dance

weekend.

There. remains untouched, for
instance, the whole issue of con-
versation. Any man who has ever
had a blind date for a weekend has
empirically verified what has long

‘been suspected by sociologists:

there is only a fixed quantity of
conversation in the world that is
available to two people thrown con. .
stantly together, and this reservoir
is a relatively small one. It is usual-
ly exhausted by five o’clock Satur-
day afternoon, though the time
varies with the verbal powers of
the participants and their rate of
word-ejection. There are several
recognized methods of prolonging
the time when at least a semblance
of communication is being main-
tained. Partial deafness requiring
your date to repeat almost every-
thing is an excellent one. Telling
her about all the other girls you've
dated also fills up time nicely, and
has the added advantage of letting
her know how really fortunate she
is to be with you. And you can
give her a few little hints that ev-
ery girl welcomes about how she
can improve her appearance by not
wearing quite so much make-up,
fixing her hair differently, and
switching to frilly blouses and full
skirts instead of unbecoming tight
sweaters and tube skirts.

Innumerable problems arise in
connection with the crucial activi-
ty-decisions that a normal dance
weekend schedule brings. After the
dance is over, parties abound. A
caravan is leaving for the sandpits,
another for Cornelius. Marshmal.-
lows or ginger ale, which will It
be? This is no light question, for I
have seen whole relationships
founder on this very decision, and
one. of my best friends completely
lost his taste for marshmallows as
a result of being forced into a
sandpit party when he wasn’t a
dit hungry.

Well, this is enough to give you
an indication of the kind of thing
that needs to be done. Eventually
we may work out a whole handbook
for dance weekends that will offer
advice and encouragement for
every trying situation, a kind of
Boy Scout manual on a college
level telling you how to bulld a
fire on the golf course and find
your way back from Erwin Lodge
when they’ve locked the gate on
your car and all that kind of stuff.
Meanwhile you're pretty much on
your own, but that seems to be the
way most everybody prefers it any-
way. Don’t ever let anybody tell
you Freud was wrong. Freud in-
vented the dance weekend at the
University of Vienna. So Happy
Homecoming!
