THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 11, 1930 if

Davidson Alumni Residing
In Chattanooga, Nashville,
Louisville Hold Meetings

Forty-Eight Former Students of
Davidson Gathered Together to
Listen to Address and Discuss
Their Alma Mater

LOUISVILLE LARGEST

Captain Pritchett Also Spoke at
Preparatory Schools—Personal
Interviews Were Held

Forty-eight Davidson College alumni, re-
siding in and near Chattanooga, Nashville
and Louisville, last week had their first op-
portunity, since the establishment of the
alumni office in 1926, of listening to vis-
itors directly from the college. The tour
witnessed the establishment of two addi-
tional alumni chapters, and the meeting
again of a third group.

Captain Norton G. Pritchett, professor of
physical education, and Ernest Milton, al-
umni secretary, were the Davidson represen-
tatives. Each spoke at all of the gatherings,
touching upon practically every phase of the
college. After their talks, the meetings were
thrown open for a general discussion, in
which the alumni showed their interest by
asking numerous questions. One question
usually led to another bearing upon the same
subject.

The Louisville chapter offered the largest
delegation of the trio. Eighteen Davidson
men assembled at the Hotel Seelbach for a
dinner. The Nashville group had 16 alumni
for their dinner at the Hotel Franklin, while
Chattanooga had 14 for a luncheon at the
Hotel Patten. Toastmasters for the affairs
were Dr. J. L. Fowle, ’18, Chattanooga; R.
E. Kell, ’29, Nashville, and Rev. R. M. Pe-
gram, ’11, Louisville.

Both the Chattanooga and Nashville as-
semblies were held on the same day. Chat-
tanooga authorities advised that more alumni
were able to attend a luncheon, and a change
was immediately made in the itinerary to
conform to this, and to set the Nashville din-
ner for Tuesday night, instead of the first
suggested date of Wednesday. These were on
Tuesday, December 2, and the Louisville
chapter met on Thursday, December 4.

Elsewhere on this page will be found a
list of the alumni attending the meetings,
and also a list of the officers chosen. Nash-
ville and Chattanooga were unorganized un-
til this trip, but after some discussion, each
voted to perfect an organization. The Louis-
ville chapter has been in existence for sev-
eral years, and new officers were chosen at
the dinner.

In addition to speaking at all of these
places, Captain Pritchett appeared before the
student bodies of McCallie School and Bat-
tleground Academy. His general theme was
the testing period for preparatory students
who have just. closed an exciting football
season. Interviews were also had with pros-
pective students,

Alumni Deaths

T. G. Coltrane, ’26

Thomas Gay Coltrane, 1926 graduate of
Davidson College, was found dead in Con-
cord at 4:15 a. m. Wednesday, December 3,
death having apparently resulted from a fall
and exposure. This was the verdict of a
coroner’s jury which investigated his death.
Mr. Coltrane was last seen at 12:15 a. m.
When found, he had abrasions on the fore-
head, nose and left knee. It was at first
thought that he was unconscious, but it was
soon learned that he had been dead for some
time.

After graduating from Davidson, Mr. Col-
trane became connected with the Concord
National Bank, with which concern he was
working at the time of his untimely death.
He had taken a leading role in the life of
chis native city, and was at one time presi-
dent of the Merchants and Manufacturers
Club of that city.

Ala., saw in a Chattanooga paper a notice
of the alumni luncheon there on December 74,
called up and made reservations and drove
115 miles the next day to meet with the
other alumni.

Smet en

It is an interesting observation that 31
of the 48 Davidson alumni attending the se-
ries of meetings in Chattanooga, Nashville
and Louisville, were members of classes since
1924. Younger alumni of Davidson predom-
inate in these cities, and would naturally
lead the percentage. Many of them are teach-
ing in preparatory schools in or near those
three cities.

T. S. Lawson, ’26, has been made assist-
ant attorney general of Alabama. Since com-

Give Football Banquet

1930 Edition of Wildcats Honored—
Talks Made and Features Intro-
duced—Officers Elected

The Gaston County chapter of the David-
son Alumni Association last Tuesday night
honored the 1930 football edition of the Wild-
cats with an elaborate banquet served at
the Woman’s Club in Belmont. This was
the seventh consecutive year that this chap-
ter has paid tribute to Davidson’s elevens
in this manner, and players and officials
were loud in acclaiming this as one of the
niftiest of the series.

With R. D. Hall, ’19, of Belmont, presi-
dent of the chapter, presiding, the banquet
was started with a prayer by Rev. W. M.
Currie, 19, also of Belmont. Before being
seated, a group of grammar school boys,
dressed in football uniforms, sang “O David-
son,” and on the second chorus the entire
gathering joined in.

Prof. F. P. Hall, ’87, superintendent of
the county schools, paid one of the finest
tributes ever uttered in his welcome to the

Davidson football team and others from Da-

vidson. He lauded the pre-eminent charac-
teristics of gentlemanness and Christianness,
which always predominated among players of
Davidson, and said that in all the years that
he had watched, Davidson’s teams in action,
he had never seen an*overt act on their part
which made him ashamed or embarrassed.

Others making talks“Wwere F. L. Jackson,
06, treasurer of Davidson, Coaches Monk
Younger, '19, and Tex Tilson, Ernest Mil-
ton, ’26, alumni secretary; Captain Norton
G. Pritchett, professor of physical educa-
tion; Captain Walter Fraley, ’31; Sam A:
Robinson, ’99, of Gastonia; Hugh A. Query,
09, of Gastonia, and Dr. Oren Moore, ’08,
of Charlotte.

Dr. Moore was introduced as the speaker
of the evening, and in his inimitable manner
entertained the alumni, and mingled with
that entertainment many worth-while re-
marks. “Davidson has always represented
the one sincere ideal of my life,” he said,
“and the playing of its football team has al-
ways been a great inspiration. The spirit
of Davidson is perennial, and is grafted upon
every individual when he enters as a student
of the college.”

R. L. Stowe, Jr., ’24, and C. T. Stowe,
28, both of Belmont, were introduced as
the interwoven. pair, and these men were
responsible for the presentation of a pair of
socks, red and black on color, to each vis-
itor.

Special guests of the chapter, besides the
team and visitors from Davidson, were J. C.
Mason, father of W. A. Mason, ’31, mem-
ber of the team, and the captain and center
of the Belmont Abbey football team, coached
by A. W. Baker, ’29. The entire Belmont
High School squad, coached by J. K. Hall,
Jr., '28, came in at the close of the ban-
quet, and intermingled with Davidson’s team
and the alumni president.

pletion of his law course at the University
of Alabama in 1929, Mr. Lawson has been
practicing in his home, Greensboro, Ala.,
but will soon go to Montgomery, the state’s
capital, to assume his new duties.
