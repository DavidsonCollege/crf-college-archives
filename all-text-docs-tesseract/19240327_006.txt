CLEAR REASONING

IF we had begun these talks
when we started business
in September of 1922, you
woul very naturally have
said, “Let Hien try them out
first.”

FROM the number of men
we have clothed since
then, you may be assured
that the “trying out” days are
over.

THE worth of LUXEN-

which were taken from the twenty-seventh |

Psalm. |
Mr. Williams, “Y” secretary, in introduc- |
ing the speakers, told of the fine work they
were doing in Union and that it was a privi- |
lege to have them come to Davidson. He
especially welcomed the old Davidson stu-
dents who had come back home again.

Mr. Chalmers, better known to all the |
students as Dwight, was the first speaker.
His topic was The Password of the King-
dom, He based his remarks on Matthew |
21 :28-31, the parable of the two sons bidden |
of their father to go into the vineyard and |
work, The first said he would not go, but
later repented and went, while the second
said, “I go, sir,” and went not.

“Several years ago,” said the speaker, “I,
was on guard duty at Plattsburg, and orders
were given to let no one pass without the
proper password. If a spy had learned the
password he could easily have slipped in. So |
it is that God did not make the pasword of |
the kingdom a mere word; He made it a!
life, a character, one’s works. ‘Not every
one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, but he
that doeth my will.”

Mr, Chalmers said that while everyone is |
willing to talk about religion and the theory |
of it, there are far too few who are willing to |
put the theory into practice. “It is the every- |
day life that counts, and we must keep step
with Christ on the King’s highway.”

“We know the will of God,” said the
speaker, “for we know Christ's principles on
the questions of honesty, morality and deal-
ing with our fellow men. If I were to give
you a Hoffman’s head of Christ, could you
hang it in your room now or would some
change have to be made? ‘If any man will
to do His will, he shall know; we know the
will of God and it falls on us to practice it.”

He ended his address with a touching ap-
peal to let God have full sway? in the life
and to be willing to do what God calls on one
to do.

After a selection by the quartet, Mr. Prit-|
chard spoke, basing his talk on the passage |
where Paul says, “This one thing I do—I|
Press on.” “Since you have heard about the |
password of the kingdom,” said Mr. Prit- |
chard, “I want to talk about the watchword |
of the Christian. The watchword is ‘This |
one thing I do—I press on.’ There are many |
of us who think we are pressing on when
we are on the side-track instead of on the
main-line.”

He said that we should Press on, first of
all, in our own lives, giving them over to
the will of God, and letting Him have His
way. “If He wants us to be a Christian
lawyer, doctor, business man, preacher, and
we do something else, we are not pressing

”

On.

Mr. Pritchard went on to show ‘how one
should also press on in his college life be-
cause there are so many things which need
to be done that are not done. There are
always men who need help and men are
often blind to their needs or else have not
the courage to try to help them,

“Some of us,” he said, “because we think
we will have to give up something, are not
willing to press on. We love to play with
the things of the world and yet call our-
selves Christians, but there never was a
worldly Christian, because a man must let
éither one ‘or the other go. We must get
off the fence and be on one side or the
other.”

In closing) he said, “We must ever remem-
ber to press on, forgetting the things that
are behind and looking to the goal before

The awarding of the Golden Quills was
‘established by the Davidsonian in conjunc-
|tion with the Reporters’ Club as a purely
‘local institution, It is singular in nature,
there being no other similar award in any
Southern college insofar as the Davidsonian
has been able to learn. Its purpose is pri-
marily to further the standard of journalistic |
writing for the weekly periodical. It is a}
step higher than the Reporters’ Club, being
an additional honor to selection into this
group.

The wearers of the Golden Quill at Da-|
vidson this year are W. H. Sharpe, Listan |
D. Elkins, W. F. Gallaway, D. B. Walthall,
Jr, C. M. S. McIlwaine, H. B. Price, and

God with your money” was the emphatic ap-
plication of his sermon. Through prayer and

The recently elected men are representa- |
tives of the three upper classes. A. M. |
Hurd, a Senior, has served faithfully and |
well while at Davidson. He has taken a|
great interest in the Davidson publications,
and is a member of Delta Pi Kappa honorary
fraternity and business manager of the Da-
vidson College Magazine. Proof of his

| ability in work for the Davidsonian is shown

in his election to lead the Reporters’ Club
through a successful year following the resig-
nation of the former president, D. B. Wal-
thall, Jr. |

G. D. Rogers, a Junior, came to Davidson |
last year from Johns-Hopkins University.
Since coming to Davidson he has been deeply
interested in Davidsonian work.

C. F. Smith, W. E. Milton, A. Y. Bowie
and C, F, Monk are all members of the class
of ’26 who started reporting for the David-
sonian the first of their Freshman year.

bership in the Reporters’ Club last spring.
