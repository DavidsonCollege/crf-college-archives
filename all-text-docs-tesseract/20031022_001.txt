CCRL to

hear cable
argument

By Ros HEiprick
Staff Writer

The Council on Campus and Reli-
gious Life will soon evaluate the pro-
posal forcable in studentdormrooms.

The CCRL is a board composed of
several key Davidson administrators,
faculty, and students. Sophomore
Class President Jack Hubbard ’06
plans to present the issue to the CCRL
on Oct. 23, when the board will an-
nounce its recommendation.

While the CCRL meets, a recent
Residence Life survey suggests sup-
port for cable among the students. An
online poll begun today by the SGA
could further reinforce those find-
ings.

Hubbard, who began his cable
campaign last spring, says that hav-
ing cable access in individual student
rooms is vital to a modern college

campus, *~>- ~~ sine deen

“In today’s world, cable TV serves
as a major artery of information,” he
says. “Students are unhappy with the
cable situation, between disappear-
ing lounges, disagreements over what
should be on the television, and
Adelphia’s horrendous service. It’s
time for change.”

Five trustees claim
posts on ruling board

Latest appointees
will fill specific needs
in serving College

By Lestie HEMPSON
Staff Writer

Five new trustees were elected by

the Board of Trustees Nominating
Committee and the Alumni Associa-
tion over the course of the past few
months in a process that culminated
on Oct. 10.
_ Fourof the five trustees, Sherburne
Laughlin, Stephen Salyer, Kevin
Hanna, and Wallace Millner were
elected by the Alumni Association,
while the fifth, Todd Thomson, was
elected directly by the Nominating
Committee.

Trustees are eligible to serve two
four-year terms, and elections are

held roughly once a year. The quali-
fications that potential trustees must
meet are not as stringent as they have
been in the past. President Bobby
Vagt said,““There was a time, not too
many years ago, when every member
of the Board of Trustees had to be
approved by a Presbytery.”

Although at least 16 trustees must
be members of the Presbyterian
Church (USA), the rest may belong to
other denominations. The, 16 Presby-
terian trustees, however, must all be
confirmed by their respective
Presbyteries.

President Vagt explained this re-
quirementby citing Davidson’s long-
standing affiliation with the Presby-
terian Church. He remarked that
Davidson attempts “to respect and
stay tied to that faith heritage but at
the same time, [recognize] who we

Theater
Review

By Derek Lou
Arts and Living Editor

“Frankenstein: the Rock Opera” presented a problem: given the show’ s
dates and our publishing schedule, we had to base our review on a
rehearsal. Uneducated in musical theater, loath to judge publically my
peers’ creations, and sympathetic to technical difficulties, I present this
commentary as mere reflections from a dress rehearsal.

The show starts swimmingly. The overture outlines the plot and
introduces the cast, most of whom do double or triple duty. Victor
Frankenstein (Bryant Kirkland ’07) soon appears on stage and rummages

through a graveyard for parts. Acting with dramatic flair, Kirkland |

delivers one of the production’s best performances.

The other major roles are Elizabeth, Frankenstein’ s girlfriend played by
Laura E. Heinze ’07; Clerval, Frankenstein’s best friend played by Mac
Skelton ’07; and the Monster played by Alan Stevens ’04. With their
capable voices and stage presence, these performers are uniformly
excellent.

Beginning on a ship in the Arctic, the “Rock Opera” follows Shelley’s

story faithfully. The musical is a game

The Town of Davidson received a
grant from the Governor’s Highway
Safety Program in June of 2003 that
will allow the Board of Commission-
ers and the town police department to
make needed changes in enhancing
pedestrian and cyclist safety.

These changes in traffic enforce-
ment and various physical aspects of
the intersections in town come in
response to safety concerns related to
increasingly high volumes of traffic
on Main Street and Concord Road.

Meredith Judy °99, current mem-
ber of the town’s Traffic Safety Com-
mittee, says that the committee is
now in the process of signing con-
tracts with engineering firms.

Some of the coming improvements
include building brick crosswalks for
better visibility and extending the
curbs at intersections farther into the
road.

These changes will be imple-
mented at the intersections of Main
Street at Concord Road, Depot Street
at Main Street, Lorimer Road at Con-
