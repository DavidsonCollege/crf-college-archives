BEHIND LOCKED DOORS

There are no skeletons in that locked cage opposite the Acquisi-
tions Office in the library—just books and related odds and
ends. And the contents are available to any student who asks,
according to Library Director Chalmers G. Davidson. The cage
contains overflows from the vare book room and duplicates
from the Davidsoniana room, Davidson said, as well as loose
materials and books that tend to disappear from the open
shelves, such as a “dull” history of prostitution. (Staff Photo

Lasso. a U.N. diplomat and
past president of Ecuador,

since its inception, according
to PRAM National Director
Tom Peddicord. He has been
particularly helpful. Peddi-

unique. opportunity to experi-

important area of the world.”

Debaters Enter
Dartmouth Meet

By ED SHOAF
Staff Writer

The Davidson varsity de
bate team gained experience
with one win out of eight
rounds at an invitational de-
hate tournament at Dart
mouth College last weekend.

Gray Mason and Gary Cash
represented Davidson at the
Thirteenth Annual Dartmouth
Invitational Debate Tourna
ment. which is one of the
most respected in the nation.

Their one win out of eight
rounds was not impressive.
but they and debate director
Ray McMillin said they were
out to gain experience and
had no real hope for a ma-
jor victory.

The one win, however, was
not overly discouraging. The
last Davidson team to go two
years ago won no rounds.

McMillin attributed the im-
provement to the fact that
his debaters were better pre-
pared as the result of a
change in debating policy
that actually occurred last
fall,

When it was established
three years ago, the educa-
tional aspects of debate were
stressed by the program.
Now the emphasis is chang-
ing to winning tournaments.

McMiliin cites several rea-
sons for the change. First.
the tournaments were becom-
ing more difficult.

In addition, the debate
team hopes to gain prestige
by winning and thereby in-
crease its financial backing

both to improve the prograin
and to attract new students
into it.

He emphasized. however.
that the program was not
threatened with extinction
from financial pressure be
cause the debaters were not
winning. Money for the pro-
gram is provided in the reg-
ular college budget.

In spite of the lack of finan-
cial attraction in debating
for prospective students, Mc-
Millin hopes he can produce
an effective program by us
ing new methods.

QUIET ISSUES HANDLED

Committee Plods Along

By EDWARD HAY
Staff Writer

The Faculty Student Life
Committee, in dealing with
issues that are not ‘'showy,"
has received undue criticism
for accomplishing little, ac-
cording to Richard C. Burts,
dean of students.

“The work of the commit-
tee,"’ said Burts, “has been of
such a basic nature that
they haven't received much
publicity. Actually, the group

Manor
Remains

Unused

Since the beginning of this
semester and the disbanding
of the Lingle Manor group,
the house has remained un
used.

The group itself decided
that its ‘‘fraternity substi-
tute’’ format was a failure.
and since then several orga-
nizations on campus have
been trying to abtain permis.
sion to use the building.

Robert A. Currie. college
treasurer and business man-
ager, said that its use would
be determined primarily by
the needs of the college. He
said he expects that the needs
will become evident when the
budget is presented in April.

Faculty and administration
members may need more of-
fice space and rooms for the
audio-visual euipment, he ex-
plained.

The Student Life Commit-
tee has filed a recommenda-
tion to the treasurer's office

that the building be turned:

over to the College Union, ac-
cording to Committee Chair-
man W, G. Workman.

The Union would follow the
suggestions of the Freshman
Council that the building be
used as a freshman social
and study area.

Committee members decid-
ed to recommend that the
use of the building be given
to the Union because it has a
more permanent character
than the Freshman Council.
the other serious contender.

The committee submitted
its recommendation 12 days
ago, and is waiting for a re-
ply.

Concert
Groups

Examined

The Platters, Josh White
Sr. and Mitch Rider and the
Detroit Wheels highlighted
the Block Booking Conference
in Charlotte on Feb. 14-17.

Charlie Cameron, president
of the Social Council, and Ed
Embree, president of the
College Union. led the dele-
gation from Davidson to ‘in
vestigate possible acts for fu
ture concerts.

The group from Davidson
listened to over 30 groups
perform during three nights.

Cameron said that no
groups were contracted for
next year, but that the con
ference ‘‘was a good chance
to meet the agents we will
be working with next year.”

Cameron was disappointed
in. the conference, however.
because ‘‘we had money com-
mitments and date commit-
ments, but few other colleges
there did, hurting our abil-
ity to bargain with the
groups.”

has been very busy."

The group is limited, Burts
explained, by its largeness.
The members are “busy peo-
ple’’ and it is sometimes dif.
ficult for them to meet.

Earlier in the year, the
committee met with the com-
mittee drafting the Residence
Hall Association (RHA) Con-
stitution. The group at that
time noted conflicts with the
proposed Student Govern.
ment Constitution, and the
matter was set aside.

Since then, the RHA Con-
stitution has been returned to
the committee and is now
ready for approval, accord-
ing to Burts.

Also brought before the
committee was the proposed
SGA Constitution, which they
helped to “tighten up.’ Sev-
eral additions and suggestions
were made at this time.

The committee is now
working in a coordinated ef-
fort with the Student Council
to review the faculty regula-
tions. According to Burts the
entire set of regulations has
been set aside for a new
start.

A proposed school drug
policy has been shelved in
favor of considering it in con.
nection with the broader reg-
ulations of the school, rather
than give it specific atten-

iton.

Student reaction to the new
SGA Constitution will help
guide the committee in the
future, Burts said. The group
will be able to better under-
stand the intentions and de-
sires of the students.

The committee consists of
faculty members R. D. Kay-
lor, N. M. Johnson, T. A.

Williams, A. A. Wolf, W. G.
Workman, J. B. Stroud and
Burts, and students Randy
Phillips, Bill Andrews and
Tom Earnhardt.

The success of the student-
faculty work together is en-
couraging, said Burts, ex-
pressing the hope that soon
the student committees would
allow faculty as members.

‘Stop The World’

Set Tomorrow

Jackie Warner will appear
in Davidson tomorrow in the
musica]: ‘Stop the World, I
Want to Get Off.’

The play will be staged at
3 p.m. in Love Auditorium.

The musical originally play-
ed on Broadway for several
seasons and starred Anthony
Newley. The performance in-
cludes such songs as ‘What
Kind of Fool Am I,”" ‘Gonna
Build a Mountain" and “Once
ina Lifetime.”

The reason for the late an-
nouncement of the play is
that the contract was not
completed until Monday, ac-
cording to C. Shaw Smith,
director of the College Union,
which is presenting the play.
Tickets cost $2 for students

4

and faculty members and
$2.50 for the public.

Because of the late notice,
the Union is getting the play
at a reduced price, although,
according to Smith, it ‘does
cost’ and this is the reason
for the $2 admission charge.

The book, music and lyrics
were written by Leslie

Bricusse and Anthony New-
ley. The Davidson production
will be presented by On The
Aisle. Inc.

If you don’t agree that
business destroys individuality,
maybe it’s because you're an
individual.

There’s certain campus talk that claims
individuality is dead in the business world.
That big business is a big brother destroy-

ing initiative.

But freedom of thought and action, when
backed with reason and conviction’s cour-
age, will keep and nurture individuality
whatever the scene: in the arts, the sciences,

and in business.

Scoffers to the contrary, the red corpus-
cles of individuality pay off. No mistake.

Encouraging individuality rather than
suppressing it is policy in a business like
Western Electric—where we make and pro-

vide things Bell telephone companies need.
Because communications are changing fast,
these needs are great and diverse.

Being involved with a system that helps

keep people in touch, lets doctors send car-
diograms across country for quick analysis,
helps transmit news instantly, is demand-
ing. Demanding of individuals.

If your ambition is strong and your abili-

ties commensurate, you'll never be truly
happy with the status quo. You'll seek
ways to change it and—wonderful fecling!—
some of them will work.

Could be at Western Electric.
