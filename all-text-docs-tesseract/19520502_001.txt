called or enlist in the armed forces
will meet for an informal question-
answer session at Erwin Lodge
Tuesday about 2:30 p.m. This is
the first time these men will have
convened as a group.

Since the future military men
have never before been brought to-
gether for any reason, and since ‘it
is evident that they will be enter-
ing a new type of living and en-
vironment, and consequently have
many questions, problems and un-
certainties on their minds, the pur-
pose of the gathering is to fa-
miliarize them with these problems
and try to give them solutions and
answers to them.

The men who will lead the.
. discussion and answer any
questions concerning the mili-
tary life are: Professor Iain
Wilson, who served during
World War II as a chaplain
in the Royal British Army; Dr.
William Workman, who served

ments by early next week.

Gets College Nod

According to the circulation statistics for this year at David-
son College. the most popular book in the college family is
LeGette Blythe's “A Tear for Judas.”

The biblical historical novel ap-

pealed about cqually to faculty|ner. It received extravagant praise

members and students and led by
a considerable margin all other titles
in the popular reading category.
Dr. Blythe is a neighbor and
good friend of Davidson College.
He lives in Huntersville and has
been writing novels for some 20
years. Davidson College gave him
a D. Litt. degree several years ago
for his distinguished work in crea-
tive writing.
The next best seller has also
a local connection. It is Bill
Styron’s “Lie Down in Dark-
ness.” Styron spent his fresh-
man year at Davidson and then
went to the war and to Duke.
“Lie Down in Darkness” is a
modern novel in the Faulkner man-

from the nation’s top reviewers.

It is hardly in the David-
sonian tradition except that
what the author set out to do,
he did well. Some might ques-
tion whether or not it was
worth doing but apparently not
those who set our standards in
literature today.

In order of thew popularity, the
next in the first ten at Davidson

Monsarrat, “The Cruel Sea,”
Jones, “‘From Here to Eternity;”
Marshall, “A Man Called Peter;”
