There is an element in the student
body to which the dance system as now
planned does not reach at all. Few people
realize that the price of a dance ticket is
conservatively only one-third or less of
the cost of an average dance week-end.

This year’s ’an- Hellenic council has
agreed to invest any profits that it may
show in war bonds for the new gym-
nasium drive. If they could have this
item and others which would be elimin-
ated by having local dances, they could
show a profit that would help any drive.
Naturally this council cannot speak for
future ones, but it imagines that they
would be willing to do the same thing. In
any event, there is no reason that spon-
soring groups should not be charged for
the use of a hall here as in Charlotte for
a cause as worthy as the gym drive.

desirable

Dances could be confined to more suit-
able hours. Chaperonage of dates could
be handled as it certainly is not now.
Should a mother attempt to get in touch
with her daughter on a dance week-end
now, there is no way of even discovering
where the young lady ds staying. Provi-
sion could be made whereby all the girls
would be in by some reasonable hour,
There can be no such provision now.

Perhaps the argument that Davidson
is a church school, hence there should be
no indulgence in the worldly pleasure of
dancing within her bounds is the one
which the “pros” ofthis question have
had the most difficulty in answering.

We do not wish to become involved in
any theological arguments which we are
not equipped to support, but we would
like to point out the position of the Gen-
eral Assembly of the
Church on this matter.

Presbyterian

In the seventieth meeting ot this body
in the summer of 1930 in C harlottesville,
Va., Concord Presbytery, in which Da-
vidson is located, tendered an overture

“asking, the Assembly to reaffirm the
historic testimony of-our church:as to
the moral danger of card playing ‘and
dancing and theatre-going, or failing
that. to rescind former actions advising
against these forms of indulgence.”

The Assembly replied by accepting the
report of the Committee on Overtures
which ended with the paragraph, “The
personal decision in such mattefs is to be
made by a Seripturally enlightened con-
science under the guidance of the Holy
Spirit, rather than through enforced
obedience to.positive prohibitions of par-
ticular forms. of hurtful indulgence and
amusements,”

The “Scripturally enlightened con-
science” in our case is the faculty and the
3oard of Trustees. The Pan-Hellenic

_council in conjunction with the Student

Body as a whole and its leading organi-
zations is preparing a petition and plan
to be-presented to them. For a “better
Davidson” we feel it deserves their most
careful consideration.

plicated by. the
- axiom that the

thing that
a girl wants to

=~only

do on a date is

some-

For

Bill Lyman

some inexplic-
able reason, a girl is never content
unless“ she’s “noted at the right
places at the right-times in the right
clothes with the right men. Have
you ever seen a girl who was satis-
fied with a mere movie for the

evening's extra-curricular activity?
Of course not!

After the show sh® must go to a
popular “coke” joint. As as
she arrives she cranes her neck look-
ing all around the place, and if not
enough of the right people are there,
she decides she wants a bag of pop-
corn, or something equally inane
that can’t be purchased at that
place. (What-she-actually wants—is
a steak dinner, which she orders
when she arrvies at the place de-
sired.) So you go to another joint,
and if enough of the right people
are there, she will entrench for the
evening.

I repeat, all that a girl wants is
to be “seen”. But how much good
can you under Stich circum-
stances? Do you think that the girl

screen?

[ cannot understand how girls ever
really enjoy themselves. Aff that
they think about is the next dance
set or the next football game, and
then when either does come, in-
stead of having a*good time they
think about and scheme for the
next dance set or the next football
game. So that to do any good with
a date you absolutely cannot give
in to your dates who wants to be
“seen”, You've got to get her some
place where there will be no out-
side attractions,

Problem: How can you get your
date to a nice quiet little place with-
out annoying /her? Again | say, only
the most suave and experienced op-
erators, one of which “By-Lines”
is certainly not, can do so effective-
ly. 1

The only definite rule that “By-
Lines” can lay down is this: Don't
ever get into anything intellectual
with a girl unless you're feeling par=
ticularly mean and nasty. A girl will
go to any extreme, rather than be
caught at such arts as discussing
politics, philosophy, sports, or
books, or play “Quiz,” or play a
game where it takes quick thinking.

Indeed, I know one girl who did
quote a few appropriate lines from
Wordsworth at a dinner party, and
was forthwith. sent to an asylum.
