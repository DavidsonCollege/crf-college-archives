Past English majors extol benefits of English major ~~

First of Two Parts

By NELLE McCORKLE

In response to a Davidsonian
survey, English majors graduat-
ing from Davidson in 1980 and
1981 reevaluated their own deci-
sions about their major, indicated
the ways they found jobs. des-
cribed their past and present posi-
tions and advised-current David-
son students. Davidson’s class of
1980 included 21 English majors
and the 1981 class had 29; 20 per-
cent responded to the question-
naire.

One of the ten alumni _re-
sponding holds an MBA; three
others have earned law degrees
(an additional two are still in law
school). Two alumni went di-
rectly from Davidson to graduate
school: one got his law degree and
the other went on to a Ph.D. in En-

 glish.

None of the respondents found
his or her job through the David-
son Careers Office. but one alum-
nus received help from the French
department to become a teacher
for the French Ministry of Educa-
tion in Alsace. This graduate
wrote, “This was a great déal: a
job, room, board, and income for
a year with lots of vacation time.
[I] hope students are still taking
advantage of this!”

One alumnus, a third year stu-
dent at Vanderbilt Law School,
emphasized the importance of
personal initiative and personal
contacts. About finding a job, he
wrote, “Do not rely on the place-
ment office. They’re wonderful
people, but you’re the only person

them.”

Visiting director Connie
Welsh is artistic director of Char-
lotte’s Tarradiddle Players and
teaches theatre at Queen’s Col-
lege. She brings a special back-
ground to the production of
Brighton Beach Memoirs: “This is.
so much a part of my growing up.
I grew up in Manhattan in an-
ethnic center as a Jew. I re-
member, my grandparents were
orthodox Jews. I am remembering
little mannerisms and customs
that I did not observe while I was
growing up.” Welsh believes that
it is precisely this ethnicity that
caused theatre professors Rupert
Barber and Joe Gardner to choose
this play. In the South, we are sel-
dom confronted with our ethnic-
ity. The subtle ethnicity of Bright-
on Beach Memoirs will approach
quietly us without offending us.
Neil Simon uses his Jewishness to
create humor without moving into
uncomfortable satire. This touch
of ethnicity combined with
Welsh’s gift for directing relation-
ships between people and charac-
terization produces exciting pos-
sibilities for Davidson's Brighton
Beach Memoirs.

The production of Brighton

Béach Memoirs is a homecoming.

for Welsh who lived in Davidson
for many years before moving to
Charlotte with her creation, Tar-
radiddle Players — a company of
adults who produce children’s
plays. Although she acted on
numerous occasions in college

who can care enough about your
future to grab what you want!”

Asked what jobs or industries
present English majors should
consider, an alumna _ wrote,
“Whatever your are interested in.
The sky is the limit. Be creative.
Do things or go places that seem
important to you.” a

Industries recommended by
English alumni include jour-
nalism, management, marketing
and sales, law and teaching. One
alumna worked as a banking de-
partment paralegal for a New
York law firm immediately fol-
lowing graduation wrote, “Con-
sider a bank . . . Training pro-
grams are excellent, and provide
education that would be of benefit
to any future job (also, things not
likely to be learned as an English
major).”

Now employed as an Atlanta
law firm associate, she wrote, “I
believe being a paralegal was
helpful in helping me decide
whether I wanted to be a lawyer
and helped convince my firm that
I had the necessary training and
conviction. Law scheol is not for
the faint-hearted-and should not be
undertaken just because you can-
not think of anything else to do.”

Another lawyer, first employ-
ed as assistant manager of a retail
gift shop, called the English major
“terrific preparation for law
school and law practice.” A third
lawyer, who recommended man-
agement, sales and marketing as
fields English rnajors should con-
sider, suggested earning an MBA
and working as a summer corpo-
rate intern. She wrote, “Interview
heavily in college.”

productions, she has never di-
rected Davidson College students
before. She has looked forward to
the opportunity to work with
Davidson students, who she des-
cribes as bright and perceptive:
“There is a tremendous satisfac-
tion in knowing that everything
you say they listen to and every-
thing you encourage them to do
they do. It is exciting to be lis-
tened to and also it keeps me on
my toes because I can’t fool
around and pretend I know what I
am doing. They spot dishonesty in
any form, and that is challenging.
There is a Davidson persona that
comes forth in anything they do,”

says Welsh.
The cast of Brighton Beach
Memoirs consists of Brian

Kosanovich as Eugene Jerome;
Cameron Dougan as Jack Jerome;
Noel Brewster as Kate Jerome;
Grant Morain as Stanley Jerome;
Alyssa Kendall as Laurie; Marisa
Gaba as Nora; and Catherine Nor-
ton as Blanche.

The play will be presented in
Hodson Hall at 8 p.m. on April
24, 25 and May 1, 2 and at 7:30
p.m. on April 30 in Hodson Hall.
Tickets are $3 for students. Call
the box office at 892-1696 be-
tween 2-5 p.m. weekdays begin-
ning April 13 to reserve tickets.
Welsh says, “It’s here. It’s now,
It’s these young people expressing
themselves through this vehicle
and if we touch you, if we make
you laugh or make you cry then
that’s our payment.”

Graduates cited volunteer ex-
perience as helpful background
for finding and executing a job. A
second year law student who plans
to become a public-interest lawyer
wrote, “I think experience is criti-
cal and I wish I had done more
work-volunteer is as valuable as
paid-in areas I was interested in. I
wouldn't have floundered so
much after school. Between jobs I
volunteered at legal services and I
know that helped me get my sec-
ond job (as a district’attorney’s
crisis counselor for victims of vio-
lent crime, doing public speaking,
court orientation, and service re-.
ferral). You have to try things to
know what you like.”

Six graduates cited personal
contacts as a means of obtaining
their first jobs. The graduate who
worked as a New York paralegal
simply sent her resume and then
visited the firm for an interview.
She advised, “I believe it is impor-
tant to have a face to face inter-
view. I often told potential em-
ployers that I was going to be in
their city and would like to stop by
or have an interview. Do not wait
for them to volunteer to arrange
for your transportation to an inter-
view.” In her response, she told
English students, “Interview on
‘campus, send out lots of resumes,
be willing to use any connection
you might have.”

Nonprofit experience also
helped a lawyer who wrote, “Get
involved in community govern-
ment, organizations, churches,
and anywhere you meet commu-
nity leaders. Give time to the
charities of your choice.”

Besides recommending vol-

unteer activity, graduates
suggested summer jobs and inter-
nships to provide job preparation.
“When turned down -for a bank
position, I was told that those
hired for the training program had
spent their summers working at
that bank . . . . Ifyou know what
direction you want to head, start at
the bottom, if necessary, for sum-
mer jobs to gain experience! !”
First employed as an intern
youth pastor at a Nashville Pre-
sbyterian church following gradu-
ation, one alumna has since
worked as a paralegal and as a di-
rector of West Tennessee Foster
Grandparent Program; she now
teaches seventh grade Latin and
English at a Memphis private
school. Asked if she were. satis-
fied with her selection of an En-
glish major, she responded,
“Yes — especially completing a
thesis under Dr. Holland. As an
English major at Davidson, I was
challenged to think clearly and to
communicate either orally or
through written work. Employers
want employees .who can reason
on their own, be creative, and ex-
press themselves.” This graduate
claimed, “‘Davidson’ on my re-
sume landed me this teaching job
after a ten-minute interview!”

Regarding summer experi-
ence, the third-year Vanderbilt
law student wrote, “Take any in-

ternship (even nonpaying, if you
can swing it financially,) you can
get your hands on. Don’t waste
your summers sitting around the
pool when you can be learning
something.”

Previously employed as a
writer for the Atlanta Constitu-
tion, Nashville Banner, and the- -
Palm Beach Post, one alumnus
now edits the Vanderbilt Journal
of Transitional Law. “(T) am prob-
ably doing a better job editing be-
cause I spent a couple of years
knocking out‘two of three stories
daily for print,”:he said. “Forcing
students to write weekly would be
th most helpful act Davidson
could do-for its students, A re-
quired thesis for all English
majors might also be a good idea.”
Of his newspaper work, he wrote,
“The skills you develop will be
bankable whether you go into
journalism or not.”

A CIA employee, however,
advised English majors against
journalism careers. He wrote,
“Don’t bank on newspapers, pub-
lishing, newsletters — they are
few and liberal arts majors are
many.” This graduate obtained his
job following an interview at the
Washington, D.C., CIA security
office during his senior year
spring break; he sold books at the
National Gallery of Art as a first
job while waiting for processing
of his security clearances.

The last portion of this story will appear next week.

Editor’s Note: This is the first installment of The David-
sonian’s newest feature, Life in Hell. This is a valiant at-
tempt on our part to be a chic urban weekly. ,
