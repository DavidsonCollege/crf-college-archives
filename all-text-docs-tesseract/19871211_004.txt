Phon-a-thon nets $ 1 52.000 for Fund

By MARIA DOUGLAS.

The SGA Phon-a-thon topped
its. Sesquicentennial. goal of
$150,000 by raising approxi-
mately $152,000. “That’s appar-
ently the most ever made,” said
Charlis Winn, one of three SGA
Phon-a-thon chairpersons. Becky
Castleman and John Black along
with Millie Snyder, director of the
Phon-a-thon and Gracia Slater,
director of the Annual Fund were
organizers of this fund-raising
event.

“We started organizing the
Phon-a-thon early fall term,” said
Winn. “We had weekly meetings
to go over crucial things like
which groups to put together,
renting phones, finding a T-shirt
design, ordering T-shirts, decid-

" ing which nights to hold the Phon-
a-thon, getting night chairpersons
from each house and publicity.”
The organization paid off.

Over 350 students participated
from November 30 through De-
cember-8,-placing between 600
and 700 calls a night to raise
$152,000, up $7,000 from last
year. “We hoped we would do as

well as we did but we really didn’t ©

expect it with the economic reces-
sion. But it didn’t have a negative
affect at all,” Winn said.

The Phon-a-thon is the last leg
of the Annual Fund’s money rais-
ing efforts for the year. The money
raised goes towards the school’s
annual operating costs. The Liv-
ing Endowment also supplies
WDAV and the WildcatClub with
funds for operation. Phon-a-thon
proceeds make up a good part of
the $2 million that the Annual
Fund raises, said Snyder.

The Annual Fund raises most of
its money through each class’
fund raising chairman who writes
aletter asking all the people in that

class to contribute. Later, class
agents call the alumni as a follow-
up. Snyder said, “We use the
Phon-a-thon to get in touch with
people who have fallen through
the cracks.” The Phon-a-thon is
also used to solicit contributions
from parents of currently enrolled
Davidson students.

This year saw the addition of

two groups to the Phon-a-thon

schedule. Freshmen and inde-
pendents were given a night to get
them more involved with the
school and to provide non-affili-
ated students with an opportunity
to raise money for the school. The
freshmen and independents to-
gether produced the event’s third
highest nightly fundraising total--
$23,556.. They followed Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, which came in
first with $27,924, and Kappa
Alpha, which was second with
$26,234.

Report from Awareness Weekend in Charlotte

By LUCIA KENDALL
What do youdo when your teeth
fall out? What do you do when it’s
so cold your hands swell up? What
‘do you do when you’re spending
another night on the street and you
can’t fall asleep?
These were questions a home-
less man asked. freshman Marga-
, ret Carroll, a participant in
Awareness Weekend. “I didn’t
know what to say to him,” she
commented later. “I realized that

something as normal as going to

the dentist was something this
man couldn’t do, It was so hard to
relate to them.
Experiences like these were not
unusual when twenty Davidson
students and college chaplain
Brenda Tapia spent last weekend
in inner city Charlotte. They slept
in the sanctuary of Christ the King
Center, an Episcopal church
which, among other projects,
sponsors a day care program and
houses Habitat for Humanity.
Groups of students visited a day
shelter for the homeless, repaired
walls in Seigle Avenue Presbyte-
rian Church, started to build a
house with Habitat for Humanity
and painted in Powe: the King
-Center.
The main purposes of the week-

end, according to former
Davidson chaplain Charlie Sum-
mers, who led the trip, were to
make students more aware of what
living in the inner city is like, of
what various ministries are doing
in these situations and of ways

_ students can help make a differ-
ence.

Participants named other goals,
including wanting a chance to get
to know each other, a desire to see .
that the world really does exist
beyond the campus, and a hope to
help people who are truly in need.

Many students named the sense
of community experienced during
the weekend as one of its best
features. As senior Linda Tatsa-
paugh put it: “Maybe working for
a. good cause pulls people to-
gether; we sure became one very
quickly. This is where God is.”

One of the most striking aspects
of the ministries in action was that
they didn’t just meet physical
needs. Sophomore Jay Clugston
noted that people who live in the
homes Habitat builds are not just
getting a building, they’re getting
self confidence. Christiane Hin-
richs was impressed by how happy
the members of the Seigle Avenue
Church’s girls club were because
someone cared about them.”

One Habitat volunteer made an
especially profound impact on all
the Davidson students -he talked
to. Senior Michael Poulos said,
“Jimmy had been in prison for
murder, but you could see how
God had changed his life and had
given him a second chance. His
attitude was: be happy--life is too
short.” Senior Julie Lehman
added, “It was great to see what
the Lord can do even through a
bad experience like prison to
make good come out of it.”

i When. Summers. asked _ the
group what had surprised them, he
received a variety of responses.

Freshman Sarah Dorna was
surprised that “the homeless were
willing to share their concerns, a
lot of which were spiritual rather
than physical. Some of the people
seemed happy despite their condi-
tions, and others seemed totally
without energy.”

Sophomore Therese Gyauch,
who worked for Habitat, was
amazed at how much the group
could do. “When we gotto the site,
there were only two places where
(digging for the foundation) had

even been started. But we dug and -

dug and dug, and by the end of the
day I looked up and there was a big
ditch all the way around--it really

happened! We started to do a
little; we were just out there hav-
ing fun, and talking while we
worked. If people care, it gets
done.”

“TI hadn’t realized how much
our just taking time out to come
would mean to the people and how
ready most of them were to talk,”
noted freshman Laurie Reams.

“I never expected to have a
dumpster lid fall on my head,”
said freshman Kristin Snyder.
“That was frustrating because I
felt bad for sitting around doing
nothing while everyone else was
working hard.”

Participants were also surprised
to see thateveryone pitched in and
put forth so much effort. This atti-
tude was apparent not only in the
manual labor, but also in the fact
that people cheerfully volun-
teered to wash dishes and to get up
early to make breakfast.

Tatsapaugh observed, “There
must be something spiritual about
helping people who need you
because I saw high spirits in ev-
eryone, even after aday of digging
ditches, building walls and spill-
ing paint all over ourselves. The
possibility of feeling this for a
lifetime, of working full time like
this, excites me.”

The students were delighted to
see several Davidson professors
building homes with Habitat for
Humanity.

A lot of the situations the stu-
dents came into contact with re-

ally bothered or offended them.
Reams, after hearing about the

| families in Piedmont Courts, a

low-income housing project
across the street from Seigle
Avenue Presbyterian, remarked,
“T was shocked to find out that
such a high number of teen preg-
nancies existed.”

“Children aren’t getting what
they need,” observed Gyauch.
“Their mothers are still children

~ themselves.”

Those who worked at Seigle
Avenue Presbyterian Church, an

inner city congregation where.

Summers is now pastor, did re-
pairs from a flood. Freshman
Tindal Davis commented that
“putting rotten baseboards back
on a new wall bothered me, be-

ample of the enormous difference
in lifestyles and way of thinking. I

_ realized that something as normal

as buying materials was not auto-
matic for them. They didn’t have
the money to spend.”

What bothered Dorna was her
inability to find quick solutions--
or any solutions--to the problems
of the poor.

One of the most powerful as-
pects of the experience was seeing
that in the midst of seemingly
hopeless situations, God was at
work.

A striking example of the im-
pact of inner city ministry was
Richard Campbell. Summers told
the group that his many projects
included a girls club at Seigle
Avenue for high school students.
Fifteen teenagers became active
in the group, and at the end of two
years two of them had become
pregnant.

From the eighteen girls from the
same housing project who were
not involved in it, twenty babies
were born in the same time period.
Summers explained that many
girls have never had love within
their families, and Campbell be-
comes a father figure for them.
Since hecan help them experience
God’s love, they do not have to
turn to sex as a substitute for it.

The experience made a long-
term impression on many of those
who participated. Poulos, on his
fourth awareness weekend, was
reminded that “yes, there are tan-
gible ways to communicate God’s
word and to learn to love others.”

Freshman Lisa Gerrard said,
“One of the things I’ll take back
with me when the weekend is over
is knowing that I must seek to put
Christ first in my life at Davidson,
then all other things will follow.”

Senior Jennings Craig wants to
be able “to keep my eyes open,
even if it hurts.”

“I really saw that even though I
cannot do éverything, I can do
something to help,” junior Justin
Broughton observed.

Chaplain Tapia enjoyed the
time spent talking with students in
the kitchen Friday and Saturday
night. “It’s reassuring to see that
there are people who want to
know, people who want to do.

Cause it was such an evident ex- ¢ here’s hope for the world yet.”
