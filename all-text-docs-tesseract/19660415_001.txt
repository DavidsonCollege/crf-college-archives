Honor Court Names
Whitehead Chairman

At the Wednesday night meet-
ing of the Honor Court, Alva
Whitehead was elected as Chair-
man of the Honor Court for next
year. Whitehead, a rising senior
from Lake City, S. C., is a mem-
ber of Pi Kappa Alpha and
served as their rush chairman
this year. In addition to his
duties as Chairman of the Hon-
or Court, he will also serve as
editor of the Wildcat Handbook
for next year.

Speeches by the candidates
for the office of Chairman of
the Honor Court were given on
their concept of the Honor Court
and their idea of its future. In
the same elections Ed Armfield,
a rising senior, was elected
Vice Chairman, and Ronnie
Hunt, a rising junior, was elect-
ed Recorder.

The new officers of the Court
will attend an Honor Court semi-
nar at the University of Virginia
later this month.

Whitehead sees as his main
Tesponsibility as newly elected
chairman the polishing up of
the new procedure created by

the reforms of this year.

Whitehead’s initial plans in-
clude an orientation for new
members and new officers of the
Court. Next Tuesday a mock
trial will be staged which will
employ the newly initiated in-
vesting committee and defense
advisor. The old members of
the court will give a critique of
the mock trial.

FILMS, SAILING

Union President Sets
Programs And Staff

By BILL SEIGLER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The showing of two ‘‘under-
ground” films and a discussion
with their producer, a sailing
program given by Capt. John
Biddle and several appearances
by comedian Fred Smoot high-
light upcoming events in the
Student Union, according to Pe-
ter Parrott, newly-elected pres-
ident of the Union Staff Board.

On Tuesday Capt. Biddle will
present a sailing program in
conjunction with the Davidson
Sailing Club and the Union
Board. Parrott commented that
Biddle ‘‘is one of America's
foremost sailors. In the pro-
gram, he moderates a 90-min-
ute film and is often very amus-
ing. We expect a big turnout.”
There will be no charge.

Jonas Mekas, whom: Parrott
terms as ‘‘the biggest man in
underground films in the United
States," will be on campus
Wednesday to present two of his
films and hold an open discus-
sion afterwards.

The week of April 235-30 Fred
Smoot will make several ap-
pearances in a program built
around him. Definite plans are
not yet ready for release, ac-
cording to Parrott.

Talking about the Union Board
in general, Parrott said, ‘We've
gotten the board together, re-
vamped the whole setup and got
a more organized, tighter and
hopefully ‘more efficient board
than in the past.

“The board Is staffed by peo-
ple both capable and interested
in getting the job done.”

Colonel Compliments
ROTC Department

The ROTC Department and
Brigade received superlative
compliments as a result of Tues-
day's federal inspection. Col. K.
L. Scott, who led the team of
nine inspectors, said ‘Of the
five universities we have in-
spected, we consider Davidson's
program to be the best.

“The facilities are the best,
the esprit de corps appears
very high, and good leadership
is evident throughout the pro-
gram. I think the program
here at Davidson is one which
the President of the College
should be very proud of,” he
continued.

A written report will go to
the Third Army headquarters.
But the departmental officers
received an oral briefing from
the inspectors: the inspecting
team found no significant thing
whatsoever to be unsatisfactory.

Instead, all comments were
extremely complimentary. Ma-
jor McCue and Capt. Kennedy
of Wof’ord College said, ‘‘The
drill today was extremely
sharp.’ McCue went on to say,
“The cadets were exception-
ally knowledgeable on military
subjects and showed good will-
ingness to answer questions. The
cadre (regular army officers in
the ROTC department) and the
cadet brigade staff are to be
very highly praised for getting
the men in such fine shape.”

Col. Fredrick B. Outlaw, p-o-
fessor of military science, said,
“The cadets in drill this after-
noon performed as well as at
any school I've seen." Likewise,

Cadet Col. Jerry B. Blackstock,
Cadet Brigade Commander, was
pleased with the very excellent
drill.

The inspecting team left for
Wake Forest College late Tues-
day afternoon. Last year, due
to smaller teams of inspectors,
the drill inspection was not
nearly so detailed. However,
this year there were seven offi-
cers, three from the Third Army
and two each from Wofford Col-

lege and Furman University, §

and two sergeants.

The ROTC department was
paid its second visit in as many
days by federal government
personnel when on Wednesday
afternoon a team, representing
the Department of Army, tour-
ed the ROTC facilities.

Heading the group was C.
Owen Smith, assistant to the
secretary and the undersecre-
tary of the Army, Colonel Jack
Hemingway, also an assistant to
the undersecretary, Colonel
Scott Case of Third Army Head-
quarters and Dr. Richard de
Nevfville, a White House Fellow,
comprised the remainder of the
group.

The purpose of their visit was
to express the interest of the
Department of the Army in the
ROTC program, and to observe
the actual operation of the ROTC
department.

The tous began with a con-
ference with college officials,
and concluded with an inspec-
tion of the facilities and a brief-
int by the cadet brigade staff.

Members this year include
Parrott, Bob Dugger, vi-ce-
president of current programs:
Chris Hawk, vice-president of
new programs; Charlie Elliot,
secretary; Ben King, social
chairman; Joe Obenshain, di-
rector of the Union library.

Ed Dwelle, chairman of the
new ideas committee: Mike
Mooty, head of Open End: David
Jenning, displays; Charlie Ed-
wards and John Laughridge,
publicity; Bruce Hyslop. films;
and Rich Graham, games and
recreation.

The budget which has been
submitted to the college, larger
than usual because of delayed
rush, includes money for an
offset printing press for gen-
eral college use.

Parrott expressed his expec-
tation of the Union Board's
“having the type programs
eventually to draw the whole
student body ... and... work-
ing in conjunction with other
organizations.

“We will definitely have more
social activities," including
probably three freshmen mixers
next year.

“They were at W&L not long
ago, and are supposed to have
put on a great show.”

They made the top of the
charts seven years ago with the
likes of ‘‘Charlie Brown,” “Yak-
kety Yak’. and “Along Came
Jones.” ~

The Temptations have had
more recent success, notably
with ‘‘My Girl,’ ‘Since I Lost

New Factory To Bring
Industrial Revolution

General Time Corporation's
announcement of its intention to
build a $700,000 factory off of
Davidson's Armour Drive stim-
wated one professor to com-
ment, “It looks like the Indus-
trial Revolution has finally come
to Davidson."

General Time, which is the
world’s largest manufacturer of
timepieces and timing devices,
plans to invest over one mil-
lion dollars in the plant that
will employ. 600700 people,
mostly women assembly line
workers and 40-50 executives to
be brought iin from the present
head offices in Athens, Ga.

A local restaurant owner re-
joiced, ‘‘Personally, I'm real
happy to. see something like
this. It'll mean a lot in more
ways than one. This factory
will bring a lot more business
for everybody in town. It'll
help the education around here.”

The professor forecast broad

eam | sociological changes as a result

of the factory. .
“There will be a new upper

“4| middle class who have no al-

filiation with the college.It’s go-
ing to mean a new social life
for the faculty. They will be
able to have contact with life
outside of Davidson.

“There are some of the old
people around here who don't
want any change. They want
things to stay small and quiet.
They don’t even realize how
much of a change there is go-
ing to be.

“The always

faculty fas

1| maintained its exclusive little

book clubs, like fraternities with
blackballs and everything else.
I wouldn’t be at all surprised
if this factory does as so many
companies do and sets up a

if country club for its employes.

“In the past the faculty have,
been the top dogs around here.
Now they're going to start

'] squirming, and I look forward

COLONEL ABRAMSON INSPECTS THE TROOPS
“Esprit De Corps Appears Very High

to seeing them squirm.”

He also pointed out that wages
for college employes such as
janitors and secretaries will be
pushed upward. “The student
wives who really work for noth-
ing as secretaries for the college
are going to be able to find bet-

ter paying jobs."

Real estate prices will also be
forced upward according to his
analysis. ‘‘The only danger is
that there is housing shortage
around here. This may force

them to go to Mooresville for:

homes. I've never seen a place
where people are as reluctant
to let go of Jand as Davidson.”

He prophesized changes in the
shopping habits such as better
stocked grocery stores, and per-
haps a good clean restaurant
and motel.

“It wouldn’t surprise me to
see the area on the access road
to highway 21 made into a
shopping center. The business

district, such as it is, is going
to shift in that direction.”

Expansion of the whole north
Mecklenburg County is near in
his opinion.

He listed the attractions of
Lake Norman, the planned
North South expressway in Char-
lotle, and the new interstate
highway as contributing to this
move.

The restaurant owner who
looked forward to better educa-
tion and more business said,
“I'm really a ilittle surprised
that the college Jet them come
in. Duke Power gives so much
money to the college, and Duke

Power is the one that sold the
land, so I guess there wasn't
much that the school could do
about it.

“I understand that in the
past the college hasn't wanted
things like this to come in. I
guess they want to keep things
as they are, keep the town small
so that things will be quiet
around here.**

With a mercenary look in her
eyes, she continued, “I'm going
to talk to those men in Georgia
about setting up a cafeteria
sort of thing there. After all,
being here on this street, there's
only so much that we can do
now.”

JOHNSTON HEADS STUDY

Faculty Will Consider
Revamping Curriculum

By BRUCE WEIHE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A wholesale study of the Dav-
idson curriculum wil! be con-
ducted by a faculty committee,
to be chosen at the next facul-
ty meeting, April 26.

According to Dean of Faculty
Frontis. Johnston, who proposed
such a committee at the last
faculty meting on April 5, ‘‘we
needed to look at the whole cur.
Ticulum program from begin-
ning to end.”

“The current day liberal arts
program at Davidson may need
to change.”* Johnston continued.
“Although it is imposible to
comment on what specific
changes need to be made until
the committee starts working,
there is a feeling that the ma-
jor-minor and graduation re-
quirements need to be looked
at.”

The committee will be com-
posed of seven members, one
from each of the three major
faculty sections, one selectcd at
large from the faculty, tw. ap-
pointed by President Ma: ‘in,

with Dean Johnston serving as
chairman of the committee.

Johnston stated that the pro-
posed curriculum changes evolve
from the self-study carried out
by the faculty this year, and
from suggestions offered by the
visiting committee that was
here last fall representing the
Southern Association of Colleges
and Universities.

The committee will serve
throughout the next school year,
comparing Davidson with other
small liberal arts colleges that
have made recent curriculum
changes.

Johnston also mentioned that
any changes proposed by the
committee can not go into ef-
fect next year, since the cata-
logue has already been approv-
el for the year. ‘If any changes
are pa‘sed by the faculty,”’ con-
tinued Johnston, ‘‘they will prob-
ably go into effect in the fall
of 1967,"

Dr. John Kelton, associate pro-
fessor of psychology, noted rhat
“any graduation requirement

changes will probably not affect
any class presently in Davidson,
but will affect the class of 1970.
Major or minor requirements
could effect the present fresh-
man class, but no one else
presently at Davidson.”

Kelton felt that the proposed
committee could institute a tre-
mendous overhaul of the present
curriculum. “Instead of a con-
tinuation of the series of minor
curriculum changes that David-
son has always known,” Kelton
said, “I sense this to be a ma-
jor overhaul of the curriculum.”

Associate biology professer
William Lammers expressed his
hope that the changes aren't
90 drastic as to diminish the
role of a. solid liberal arts col-
lege producing a well-rounded
graduate.

Lammers warned not to
“throw out the baby with the
bath water’’ by changing major
and graduation requirements so
that ‘basic science courses, his-
tory courses and a mastery of
languages be de-emphasized.”
