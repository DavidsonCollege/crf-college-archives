More verbal sewage from B&BB

By BONEHEAD and
the BRICK BROTHERS
IMAC Columnists

As a special feature in this!
week’s column B & BB bring
you an exclusive from the
sports departments of the AP,
UPI and NRA. It is the
national flickerball bottom five.
The teams here, you will notice,
are included not only because of
their lack of talent, but also
because of their anal compulsive
nature.
. 1) SPE: Any bottom 5 would
be bottomless without the
SPE’s who are, without a
doubt, the country’s most anal
team. The “obnoxious in vic-
tory, bitter in defeat’”’ boys have
been extremely bitter this year,
a trait going back to 1947. We
don’t know the names of any of
their players, but then we don’t
care to either, so don’t intro-
duce yourselves. Abuse.

PIKA’s: The Campus Spas-
tics are back again for another
epileptic season. Bagel-eating
team leader Boz has already
torn up his ankle, and other
mishaps are sure to follow for
this analitic club.
In truth, the PIKA’s exist
solely for the enjoyment of
freshman teams who have no
success otherwise. Remember,
as far as flickerball is con-
cerned, PIKA is Foosball.

PAX SOS: Aside from their
orgiastic practices, the coed

PAXites (not to be confused -
with bauxite, a mineral com-

monly found in the Piedmont
area and used in the production
of aluminum) have been too
tired for most of their games
this year. Nan ‘‘nanu-nanu”
Zimmerman heads a weak team
that would be greatly aided by
the return of the Wilmington 2.
What do you think, Perk?

~ EAST MEN: These women

suffer from delusions of mascu-
linity. However, don’t fault the
freshmen; they are mere pawns.
The real problem lies’ with the
hall counselors—one of whom is
a SPE, the other is worse. Need
we say more? Oh, almost for-
got—wanna take a forfeit?

OLD MEN: Ranked #4 just
one short week ago, this proud
band of antediluvian warriors
has suffered a precipitous de-
cline. Decimated by aneurisms,
the old men have collapsed in B
& BB’s intricate rating system.
Furthermore, even Freshmen
halls have learned how to attack
the once solid defense. They
drop their drawers in front ot
defensive RE ‘‘killer Kelton’”’
and simply run right past him
as he pauses to analyze the
concomittant Freudian implica-
tions. Nowadays it really is
easy to “psych” out the Old
Fogies. Rest in peace, Sterling
and Disco Dave.

Close but not quite bad
enough. . .

The yard apes; These fresh-
men prefer to play with their

_bananas up their eyes rather

than in their mouths. Last
week, in a play reminiscent of
PIKA glories, Raoul Adham

‘Abdul Rabman Aziz (who pre-

fers to be called by his newly-a-
dopted Southern Baptist name,
Bobby Moore) and Dennis
Brown were involved in a
collision that resulted in a
league leading 15 stitches. Both
are now questionable for Sun-
day’s game with Dallas.

And. now to the scores. . .

The E-baggers solidified their
#1 ranking by drilling some
freshmints, 51-6 and 45-3. Led
by anachtic, peripatetic, and

good Jim (call me Dick) Rich- .

ards, the E’s are rolling through
a preppy schedule. Also star-
ring were David (call me Dave)

Rain, inexperience hurt golfers

By BOE YOUNG
Staff. Writer

The Davidson College 1979-
1980 golf team began their
season with what coach Tim
Tallent deemed. a ‘‘disappoint-
ing but not unexpected” show-
ing at the James Madison
University Invitational Tourna-:
ment held in Harrisonburg,
Virginia, last weekend.

Led by junior L.D. Simmons,
captain, the team consists of
senior Mark Hess, junior Brett
Storm sophomore Yancey Car-
ter, and freshmen John Mann
and Bob Whalen. After three
days the team managed a
combined score of 1230, enough
to place them 11th in a field of
sixteen.

Tallent said he was not
surprised by the play due to the
amount of inexperience on the
team. He noted the team has
three newcomers on it and their
lack of tournament play made it
difficult to score well.

The low score on the team
was posted by Simmons with
233(79-77-77) followed by
Storm with 243(81-82-80) and
_ Whalen with 2468(80-87-79).
The tournament was held on
_ two different courses and in a

driving rain on two of the three
days. The weather slowed down
play and good scores were rare.

Tallent explains that David-
son works with a limited budget
and this is a contributing factor
to their competitiveness. They
do not have the money of big
universities yet still outspend
smaller schools such as Cataw-
ba. Alumni are: willing to give
money to the team, but the
Board of Trustees will not-allow
it. Even though not one cent
would go to scholarships, they
feel it would lower the school’s
academic standards, according
to team sources.

To keep the team at a
competetive level, Tallent
scouts the big junior tourna-
ments. He says,‘‘I try to sell
the school’s academic excellence
and the good facilities nearby

such as. the Charlotte Country |
Club and the Recently opened _

Mallard Head.”

Tallent looks toward the fu-
ture with enthusiasm. The next
tournament is scheduled for
November 1-3 and he emphasiz-
es the team will work extremely
hard in the following weeks,
focusing mainly on problems

encountered in the tournament.

_ Waddill, Joby (call me stupid)

Mertin, and Andy (call me
Anne) McDonald.

The #2 ranked KA’s burned
some more froshees in Sher-
manesque fashion 59-5- and
48-1. Hill staved off Recon-
struction with 3 TD passes and
Andy informs us that the
Southmen used_ exactly
14,856,291,526 nerve impulses
in their last win. Ever-returning
alumnus Percy “Knute” Bad-
ham says he’s really proud of
the boys but is disappointed in
early season Snack Bar atten-
dance.

HURTIN’ 4 CERTAIN:
The #3 team has also been
running roughshod over the
neophytes. Scores such as 47-7
and. 70-10 are not uncommon.
Ed (call me John) Haskell has

upped his pass completion per-’

centage to 63.6 while X (cali me
Jeff) Ray picked off 2 more
passes to increase his league
leading total to 5. Also Blaine
(Call me Blah; Sanders had 12
tackles and 4 assists while Dave
(Call me Dave) Welchman in-
creased his rushing average to
5.6 yards per carry, second only
to Walter Payton, according to
Statistics released tomorrow by
the league office.

Other scores:200-99, Astros 3
Reds 2, Bills 51 Bengals 24,
Orioles 5 Steelers 3, 6-2, 8-1,
32-32. Lapple.

Wildcat John "Fletcher snares a pass from

the Lafayette

quarterback to aid in Saturday’ 8 Davidson win. (Kenny Conner)

Wildcats’ latest win lands
them in top ten of division

By DAVID DONALDSON
Staff Writer
With a sluggish 16-13 win

over Lafayette last Satarday,
Davidson has moved into the

national polls for division 1-AA.
The broke into the chart as
the

ber 10 team in the
division.

While the Davidson offense -

made mistakes which led to

' Lafayette’s 13 points, the Wild-

cats’ ‘rubber band’’ defense
played more like a brick wall in
the Davidson triymph.

This week the Wildcats have
the first road trip of the season

to meet Bucknell in Lewisburg, .

Pa. The Bisons provide another
big contest for the ’Cats and are
rated two touchdowns better

than the Lafayette club. A.
‘large, physical football team,

Bucknell runs a 4-4 defense and
employs a wing-2 offense that
features small, quick backs
behind a big offensive line.
Kickoff time ‘is 1:30, Saturday
afternoon,

The Davidson offense sput-
tered and stumbled last Satur-.
day before deciding the contest
in the last two minutes. Lafay-
ette drew first blood by block-
ing a Wayne Paymer punt and

_ returning it six yards for the

score.

Davidson then tied the score
with a 98-yard drive, ending
with a Ray Sinclair dive for the
TD. Both teams missed the
extra points to tie the score at

~ gon drove deep into Lafayette

territory but had to settle for a

28-yard field goal by Wayne

Paymer to ext the scare 46 0S.

__ for halftime.

With inomentum in their
favor, the Wildcats took po-
session of ball early in the
second half after the defense
stopped Lafayette cold. The
offense quickly churned out a
first down and seemed about to-
mount a drive when Lafayette
picked off an errant Brian
Whitmire pass and returned it
43 yards for a touchdown.The
score stayed at 13-9 in favor of
Lafayette throughout a slug-

Early in the fourth quarter
the offense caught fire and
drove inside the Lafayette 10
before Ray Sinclair fumbled to
stop the drive. The defense
held again; and Lafayette pun-
ted to their own 46, where the
Cats were back in business. |

Alvin Atkinson scored the
winning touchdown from two
yards out with less than two
minutes remaining.But just
moments earlier Davidson had
been faced with fourth down
and three yards on the Lafay-:
ette 22. With the Leopard
defense expecting a run, quar-'
terback Al Rhyne, having re-
placed Whitmire in the second
quarter, raised up and threw
low and ahead of gifford Piercy. .
Piercy made a tremendous di-
ving catch at the 14. Atkinson
then carried three straight
times to punch the ball over the

total yards, the defense came up
with two key interceptions.

Prey caught pa for
yards.
