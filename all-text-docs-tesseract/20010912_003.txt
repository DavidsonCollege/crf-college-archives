First, Second Nights

Down bring music, fun

BY ROLAND F. Foss

Upperclassmen and first year students alike
flocked to Patterson Court Friday night to
celebrate First Night Down. This annual
event marked the first time the class of 2005
was allowed at Davidson’s fraternities and
eating houses.

The inaugural celebration of Fall Frolics
took place Saturday afternoon, and only hours
later “Second Night Down” commenced on
Saturday night.

The weekend started with a spaghetti din-
ner sponsored by Project Life (see story, Page
3). Over 500 people attend the event. Accord-
ing to Victoria Statler, co-coordinator for
Project Life, “In its seventh year at Davidson,
the Spaghetti Dinner had its most successful
turnout... the din-
ner itself could not
have gone better.”
The dinner netted
over $2300.

Later that night,
Pi Kappa Alpha
teamed up with
Rusk eating house
. tohostthe band “To
the Nines.”. Sigma
Phi Epsilon pro-
vided Georgia Av-
enue, and Sigma AlI-

pha Epsilon showed
off Junk in the
Trunk.

Alternative entertainment events were pro-
vided by both the Black Student Coalition
and the Office of the Chaplain. Pat Dochety
°04 attended the chaplain’s party, held at
DCPC, which showed two movies and pro-
vided food and drinks..“I was searching for
something different from last year’s First
Night Down experience,” he said. Dochety
particularly enjoyed the “fellowship with
friends and new acquaintances” the event
offered.

Fall Frolics occurred Saturday afternoon,
bringing back Georgia Avenue and Virginia
Coalition. Games, free food, entertainment,
and a beautiful day brought many out to relax
and have fun. Bronwyn McKnew ’03 liked

the fact that Fall Frolics allowed the weekend

‘ to be a “non-stop party.”

Tyler Covington ’05 had a slightly differ-
ent take on the event. “Fall Frolics was a nice
break between parties and allowed me to just
relax,” he said.

Fall Frolics, too, was officially pronounced
a success. The hook was obvious: “free food,
fun games and good music.” Will Parker ’02,
President of the Union Board, commented:
“The Union Board forged new ground this
weekend with Fall Frolics. We’ re hoping that
Fall Frolics will be an event that sticks around
for a while... people had fun.”

Saturday night saw food at Connor eating
house (featuring Papa D’s famous quesadillas)
and parties by the Davidson International
Association, Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Alpha,
CoHo, and the Black
Student Coalition.

The party thrown
by the Davidson In-
ternational Associa-
tion at the Outpost
was noted for its
unique character.
There was a wide va-
riety of dance mu-
sic—trance, techno,
and Latin. Kiril
Dimov ’05, a native
of Bulgaria, observed
that the other parties
all had “similar mu-
sic” and that their at-
mospheres were not conducive to talking.
Yurii Kornilev ’05, also from Bulgaria, at-
tended the International Association’s dance
as well. Kornilev thought that this party pro-
vided some “pretty good music,” then added
that “parties are different” here in the U.S.
from what he is used to back home.

Most students seemed to enjoy the Court
parties. A majority of those asked thought
that Second Night Down was more fun. Ty
Plowshay ’05 was “surprised by the openness
of each house” and was “impressed by the
options” between different events, whether it
was music by Copper Sails at CoHo or mov-
ies at the DCPC.

Spaghetti dinner fund-
raiser boosts Project Life

Project Life hosted its annual spaghetti
dinner on September 8, raising over $3,500
and serving over 500 students, staff, faculty,
and community members. Proceeds from the
dinner absorb the high cost of bone marrow
typing, the main focus of Project Life.

Matt Whited ‘04 and Mike Dausch °04
supplied live guitar entertainment to the crowd
that dined on Chamber’s lawn, and Project
Life t-shirts were sold to benefit the organiza-
tion.

“We really appreciate the great turnout and
hope that everyone knows what an important
cause they support when they participate in
Project Life activities,” said Kate Giguere
04.

Giguere and Victoria Statler 03 act as co-
chairs for Project Life, now in its 10" year at
Davidson College, In 2001, the organization

hopes to raise over $35,000 to cover the cost
of typing: $80 per person.

When typed, donors are registered on the
National Marrow Donor Registry and can
potentially be matched to cancer patients
who are waiting for marrow transplants. To
date, Project Life has typed over 4000 people
and has had 13 people complete the bone
marrow donation process. The organization
aspires to type at least 400 new people each
year.

Their annual bone marrow typing drive
will be held on November 13 and 14 in the
Brown Atrium of the Alvarez College Union.
Project Life t-shirts will be on sale in Cham-
bers and the Union through Sept. 15, as well
as at the Homecoming football game.

Thursday’s SGA Meeting has been post-
poned until next week due to the Union
Dedication celebration.

SGA will meet every other Thursday night
at 9:00 in the Sprinkle Room (4th floor of
the Campus Center). Please come to find

out what’s going on and to be a part of the
discussion!
