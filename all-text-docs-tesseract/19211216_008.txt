This Season Make It Something That
Will Be An Addition To The Home

(ees you can possibly give Mother
this Christmas, or any other one. for that
matter, is going to give her the pleasure and satis-
faction as will something for her home.

An attractive home suggests and encourages
home entertainment, and she will be proud to
have her cultured friends come and enjoy its
comforts and its beauty.

The furniture that you present her with need not
-be pretentious. In fact, it may be very modest,
but if in good taste, however inexpensive, it will
breathe an atmosphere of welcome and cordiali-

ty, which after all is the highest purpose of good

furniture.

With these important thoughts in mind regarding what
you are going to give Mother, don’t you believe that
furniture is the sensible gift?
