Question of

The Week

There has been some discussion
among the staff as to the interest
aroused and value of the Question
of the Week.
whether or

In order to decide
this
feature, we have made the question
of this week:

not to continue

Whether we shall continue the
Question of the Week, and why or
why not?

Ed Shewmake, Senior:

The Question of the Week gives
the students a chance to express
their own unbiased opinions in con-
cise form. It should be a great help
in changing and affirmirig policies
and customs of the college in ac-
cordance with the wishes of the
student body. It should also be of
value in expressing new ideas.

It seems to me that this column
should be of more value in set-,
tling differences between the stu-
dents and the college authorities,
and I would like to see expressed
some opinions about water fights,
dances, and so on, which are free-
ly discussed in private but which
the faculty probably never hear.

For these teasons I think the
Question of the Week should be
continued.

Alva Lumpkin, Sophomore:

I think it a mighty good thing
to maintain the Question of the
Week because it gives representa-
tive opinion on the subjects of in-
terest to the whole campus. I say,
let’s keep it!

Red Davis, Senior:

The of the Week, if
used correctly, could be a very ade-
quate and democratic means
getting at the opinions of the stu-
dent body. But under the present
setup and in the more recent past
only a certain element of the stu-
dent body has had the privilege of
expressing itself through this col-
umn. The Davidsonian should insti-
tute a more systematic method of
selecting those who participate. The
same student should not be allowed
to voice his opinion more than
twice in one school year, and each
class should have a representative
in this column each week.

.

Question

of

John Booth, Sophomore:

Why not? It.fills up space.
of ot

Jo Newell Robinson, Senior: >

To quiz or not to quiz, that seems
to be the question. I’m agin it one
week and for it the next. Because
some questions are quite pertinent
and others, well—. If a question of
the week involves something that
neither the Executive Committee
nor the Federal Government can
solve for themselves, why bother
the students, when they could bet-
ter use their reading time reading
the “Scripts 'n’ Pranks”? In short,
I think that it is better to have
one good question of the year and
invite various campus luminaries to
editorialize upon it in subsequent
issues rather than pick out some
trifle that’ might appear in Day’s
Diary?

Russell Smith, Senior:

The Question of the Week should
certainly be continued. It satisfies
our human inclination to gripe about
something when we're thwarted in
something else, and in this way pro-
vides ‘a harmless release. It also
puts a question of temporary im-
portance before the student body
and forces at least those who write
about it to do a minimum of think-
ing about it.,On the whole, I be-
lieve, the Question of the Week
does more good than harm.

Frank Hall and Drury. Thompson,
Seniors:

It should be left in because it is
an avenue of expression for the
student body. If they want to criti-
cize_ or appraise they get a chance, |
within the limitations of censor-
ship. They should be, however, made
on subjects more vital to the stu-
dent body, thereby becoming more
interesting. We, as sentor members
of the student body, hope this fea-
ture will be continued and that in-
creased interest in the student body
will result in increased importance
of the column.

Shaw Smith, “Y” Secretary:

Surely, the airing of varying views
on essential topics is always good,
both for the question at hand and

the student discussing it.
