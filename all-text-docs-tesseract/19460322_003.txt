Coach Lufler and his protegees out of drydock and build
some tennis courts, this big emphasis on net teams will rise
like a meteor and fade just as rapidly. There is enough
material and labor available to build a few courts anyhow.
Money can be obtained. Next year will be to late. So what's
the holdup? There were 42 men out for the team—that’s
a good percentage of the student body—and twice that
many of lesser ability would like a place to play.

TERRIBLE TED

After fodtball” season” was over

Ted decided that Davidson needed

He was co-captain of the Wood

MIthough he is small, Ted does
not bluff easily. We went out for
freshman football last fall and what
ever he lacked in weight he made
up-for-in--that-old- fighting spirit
He plans to-go out for football

again next fall unless the draft gets
him first.
