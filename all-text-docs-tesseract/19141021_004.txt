GOLDEN ASSISTS
- IN MEETINGS.

(Concluded from page 1)
is at present pursuing his second year’s
course at Union Seminary, Richmond,
Va., and the fact that he-has torn. him-
self away from his duties to come back
to help Davidson, shows his great love
for his Alma Mater.

Golden has been assisting Dr. Dobyns
in the special Y. M. C. A. services held
last week. ;

The old men especially remember his
cool, logical arguments, so baffling to his
opponents in debate. “The services that
Golden rendered Davidson as her inter-
collegiate debater will not soon be for-
gotten.

‘This same cool, clear-headed presenta-
tion of facts has characterized Golden’s
addresses here during the past week. As
he leaves for Richmond, Davidson unites
in wishing him all success in his work.

HOLD INFORMAL

PRAYER: MEETINGS.

For several weeks prayer services have
been held on every floor in college, and
every morning before chapel an earnest
group of men have been gathering in the
Library for prayer.

Mr. Gibbs, chairman of the Devo-
tional Committee, assisted by PP. B.
Price and J. G.. Patton, have been dis-
tributing valuable morning watch cards.
These cards have also been sent far and
wide to the various homes here repre-
sented. As a resalt there has been a
deep .change in the lives of Davidson
men.

FRESH ME N MERT
VHEIR WATERLOO.

Five-thirty, Monday afternoon found
a large part of the Freshman class, un-
der the big umbrella tree posing for a
picture. ‘Chere was a curiotis crowd of
onlookers surrounding them, carrying
paper bags and various buckets and pans.
Just as the evergreens were trving to
look pretty, of a sudden a bag hit one
on the car, splashing its watery contents
on the whole group. Pandemonium en-
sued, and in a second scores of bespat-
tered “Fresh” were hastily retreating in
every direction, pursued by the fateful
water bags.

One could see Patterson calling loud-
lv for water ashe ran over the campus.
delayed again and again until it seemed
that he would be washed away. Meek
was suddenly recalled from his occupa-
tion as an onlooker by a bucket froni be-
hind. ‘Thomas and the two Sprunts
shone with glistening dew drops as they
raced about. No one escaped. 1t seem-
ed as if the Sophs got as wet carrying
water as the Fresh did catching it. Even
Juniors were wet by mistake and the
general effect was rather dampening.

Even when the poor wet things came
to the dormitories trouble awaited them.
Every window became a loophile. and
those who had escaped in the open had
their turn. Supper was all that could
stop the havoc, when the campus was
left to darkness and hundreds of torn
paper bags.

MANY ALUMNI
ATTEND GAME.

Among those who witnessed the game
were about a dozen Davidson Alumni.
who cheered the team “on to victory.”
Vhev were led by probably the best
vell leader that Davidson has ever had,
S. W. Anderson, of Anderson, S. C..
commonly known as “Shag.” He ex-
hibited the same “pep’’ as of old, and led
the team through every single Davidson
vell and song. ‘They were lined up in
front of the Converse grandstand, which
was filled with attractive young ladies,
who time after time cheered for the
Davidson teay Among the Alumni
present were: W. §. Nicholson and T.
A. McWhorter. of Union, 8. C.: G. R:
Westrop, Gaffney..S. C.: J. H. Green-
lee, Spartanburg; H. L. Reaves, Colum-
bia. §. C.; Brown and Mattison, from
Anderson; James Todd, from Laurens,
and about half-dozen others.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN. October 21, 1914

DAVIDSON

worked successfully. 1t began with the
ball on Wofford’s 43 yard line. A for-
ward pass to Austin was good for 25
vards, and Laird gained 5 yards, 3 yards
and then went 10 yards for. a touch-
down. From a bad angle no goal was
kicked. McKay was sent in for Van de
Vanter, and Lawson foi Keesler. Wof-
ford kicks off and Walker returns 30
yards, and then runs 60 yards for touch-
down, but is called back, Davidson being
off sides. Up to this time Osborne for
Wofford had been playing a star game,
being in every play. Laird gains 15
through the line, McKinnon 15, an
Somerville 15, and McKinnon 30, an
then McKinnon hits the line for the
fifth touchdown. No goal. After sev-
eral gains Lawson crossed for touch-
down, and soon after Somerville runs
for a score. Wofferd made several gains
around end but were unable to make any
gain through the line.

Wofford’s only touchdown came when
Lawson made a forward pass which
was intercepted by Huggins. He had
an onen field befure him, and crossed for
the first and only touchdown, but failed
to kick goal. First half: Davidson 47,
Wofford 6.

The second half was like unto the
first, Davidson played a kicking and pass-
ing game almost entirely. In this latter
half Laird made two touchdowns,
Walker, Keesler and Van  DeVanter
each scored a touchdown. Wofford put
up a game fight to the very last minute
ot plav, but were poweriess on account
of lack of experience. “Vhe final score
was: Davidson 88, Wofford 6.

Referee: Parish, Georgia; Umpire:
Carson, Clemson; Head Linesman,
Brown.

A WORTHY DAVIDSONIAN.

On August 31, a young man in whom
every true Davidsonian has a special in-
terest, stood the examination for license
to practice law in North Carolina. It
hardly need be said that he passed, for
all who ever knew him, know that of
such material success is made. —

When he came to Davidson he had
many disadvantages; for one thing he was
conditioned oa a number of ‘tickets. ‘It
was not long, however, before he won
a place of respect among the students.
In Prep Greek, he made several perfect
review marks. He also made a “rep” as
a declaimer during his Freshman year,
barely missing the  Fresii-Sopi medal.
The next vear he came back with his
same old piece, “Spartacus to Vhe Glad-
iators,” and won in a walk. He was
the first, and so far the only Sophomore
to make the intercollegiate debating
team here. During his three years’ stay
he represented the college three times in
debate, losing the first, but winning the
other two. Davidson men can never
torgetr the time he and “Bill! Golden
snowed under the Wake Forest team at
Winston-Salem.

He came within four votes, of being
president of the student body. All were
Veapnointed when he did noz return. for
his Senior year. but entered the law
department of the University of North
Carolina .where he became a distinguish-
ed student.

+e is now focated at Chariotte, and
from every appearance is doing well. He
certainly had the prosperous look when
here to witness the Davidson-Newberry
game on the roth.

Those not intimateiy’ acquainted witiy
him might consider him changeable, but
the fact is. he never has changed. His
environment has changed many times,
and he has changed his tactics to meet
the new conditions, but his honesty and
tenacity of. purpose has never been
altered.

He is “there with the goods,”” and it
is predicted that in a very short time
Charlotte and North Carolina - will
recognize the merits of this typical Dav-
idsonian, James McBryde Williams;
better known among his Davidson con-
temporaries as “Socrates.” on. simply
“Sac.” “
