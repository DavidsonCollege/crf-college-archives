selection for eating clubs, and allowing
each house to choose which system it
will operate under.

PCSC chairman Warren Gould said
he still plans to continue the phone sur-
vey his committee started last week.
Gould went ahead with the survey even
though the SGA Senate voted the propo-
sal down because, “we felt a poll would
be more scientific and accurate.” Gould
also said it was “my prerogative as com-
mittee chairman” to do the poll.

The results of both the poll and the re-
ferendum should be ready by the Senate
meeting this Tuesday. The next step for
any proposal is to the Council on Campus
and Religious Life (CCRL). From there
any proposal would go to College Presi-
dent Samuel Spencer and through him to
the Board of Trustees. Spencer would

ATTENTION

not speculate how the Trustees or the
next President would receive a request
for change in the self-selection system.
In his Convocation speech last week,
Spencer firmly supported the goals of
self-selection. “The compromise being
discussed — the so-called two-tier sys-

* tem in which some groups have formal

bidding and some do not — in my view is
merely a stepping stone toward the old
system. | am convinced . . . that this
campus cannot exist half-exclusive and
half non-exclusive,” Spencer said.

“The college administration should
have been more watchful in seeing that

we did not drift back toward the
exclusivism we had abandoned. The
growing exclusivism of the fraternities is
steadily undermining the non-exclusive
Patterson Court houses, and the system
which began with a pattern of equality on
Patterson Court is now very unequal in-
deed,” Spencer added.

Dean of Students Will Terry said that
he knew of no plans to tighten enforce-
ment of the rules or spirit of self-selec-
tion. “We need to take the fruits of the
[SGA] study and decide as a community
— including students, faculty, and ad-
ministration — and decide what we want

the College social life to be like,” Terry
said. “I would hate to ever see the frater-
nities as dominant as they were in the
50’s and early 60's,” he added.

Terry said he felt the system worked
well up to about two years ago. “It kept
the fraternities more open, but first to-
tally broke down this year,” he said at-
tributing the trouble to a lack of willing-
ness on the part of freshmen to complain,
and possibly a change in the tenor of the
campus. ‘When you're involving a sys-
tem of rules and regulations and students
aren't willing to enforce them, it’s not
going to work,” he said.
