release two separate (well, sorta)
albums at the same time, each one
will be looked at individually. Use
Your Illusion] is the stronger of the
two LP’s. The album starts out
with some of Slash’s characteris-
tic guitarcrunch on the track “Right
Next Door to Hell”, a song very
reminiscent of Appetite. “Live and
Let Die” is a very powerful and
impressive cover of the Paul
McCartney classic.

Perhaps the most rocking tune
on J/lusion I is the seventh track,
“Bad Obsession”. This tune opens
with a honky-tonk harmonica riff,
followed by a Page-esque slide
guitar from Slash. Rose’s lyrics
aren’t the most intelligent; but, for
this type of raunch-rock they’re
just about perfect.

The two strongest tracks hap-
pen tobe the slower ballads, “Don’t
Cry” and “November Rain”. The
first song, “Don’t Cry”, is in the
typical style of hard rock ballads,
but the strength of Rose’s voice
and the beauty of Slash’s guitar

Guns 'N' Roses Still on Top

work lift it above the normal, ho-
hum associated with this type of
song. “November Rain,” how-
ever, is not the typical ballad. Rose
was quoted sometime before the
album’s release saying that if this
track wasn’t perfect, that he would
leave the band. Sure, Rose is a
manic depressive who spouts off
whenever he feels like it, but his
determination seems to have paid
off. “November Rain" is a very
powerful song that features not
only Rose’s vocal talent but his
talentasa pianistas well. The song
rolls peacefully on until a fade out
at the seven-minute mark leads
into a triumphant resurgence of
Rose’s wails and Slash’s leads.
Two other tracks of mention
are “The Garden”, a song that in-
cludes the vocal help of gore-rocker
Alice Cooper, and “Coma”, aplod-
ding, overbearing song thatreaches
out and simply puts you inacoma
(especially if the decibel level is
around 120 db). Overall, this 16-
track, 76-minute offering by the

addresses a wide range of issues
confronting blacks in modern so-
ciety.

Song topicsrun the gamut from
“By The Time I Get To Arizona”,
whichcondemns those in that state
who opposed the institution of an
official holiday honoring Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., to “1
Million Bottlebags”, which lam-
basts both the alcohol industry for
selling ‘poison’ to blacks (Anyone
who’s ever woken up after arun-in
with 8 Ball or Private Stock will
understand the use of the word
poison). The song also attacks
blacks themselves for willingly
opening wide as it is poured down
their.throats by the ounce (or per-
haps I should say ‘by the 40-
ounce’).

Chuckand Flav still don’t trust
the white Establishment, as Chuck
makes evident in the song “Re-
birth”: “You can’t see who’s in
cahoots/’Cause the KKK/Wears
three-piece suits”. At the same
time, however, they recognize that
blacks themselves are far from
blameless.

Chuck attempts to bust drug-_

dealing in “Nighttrain”: “There go
the sellout who’s takin’ a ride like
Cargo/’Cause he deals the keys

from Key Largo/Disgracin’ the
racé/Blowin’ up the whole crew/
Wit’ some of them lookin’ just like
you”.

Musically, this album is stan-
dard fare. Melodies are as rare as
Chinese pandas. Obscure samples
and rhythm tracks marinated in
thumping bass, though, are abun-
dant. Nevertheless, I think that
this is P.E.’s best since /t Takes a
Nationof Millions to Hold Us Back
in 1988.

In conclusion Ill just say that
ithas been my experience that there
are essentially two types of P.E.
fan. The first are black folks who
either love rap music, or love the
group’spro-black radical message,
or both. The second are white
folks who either love rap music, or
love P.E.’s rebellious middle-fin-
ger-to-the-Establishment image, or
both. Both of these constituencies
will be pleased with P.E.’s latest
product. As for the rest of you, if
you’ re not afraid of the noise, the
beat, and Chuck D’s harsh evalu-
ation of American society, give
this album a whirl. You might
learn something by looking at our
country through the eyes of an
uncompromising black man.

Gunners is a strong mix of the hard
rock, soft ballads, and overall
power that has propelled them to
the top of the charts.

‘Use Your Illusion II is, how-
ever, not quite as strong of an ef-
fort as the first //lusion. The album
is very promising at the beginning
with the inclusion of “Civil War”,
a song Guns’n’Roses previously
released ‘as a part of a_ benefit
album to aid Romanian children.
This song, unlike many of the
others, does show some intelli-
gence on the part of Rose. “For all
I’ve seen has changed my mind/
but still the wars go on as the years
go by/ with no love of God or
human rights’. / ‘Cause all these
dreams are sweptaside/ by bloody
hands of the hypnotized/ whocarry
the cross of homocide/ and history
bears the scars of our civil wars.”

There are some other interest-
ing tracks from Illusion II.
“Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door’’ is
apretty good cover of Bob Dylan’s
song, but it makes Guns’n’Roses

the eight thousandth band to do the
tune. Also, the fifth track , “Get in
the Ring”, is a direct attack on rock
and roll press executives such as
Andy Secher, Mick Wall, and Bob
Guccione , Jr., to whom Ax] loudly
exclaims, “What, you pissed off
cuz your dad gets more (women)
than you do?”. “Pretty Tied Up?”
, subtitled “The Perils of
Rock’N’Roll Decadence”, is an
upbeat, rocking tune that is again
filled with Rose’s ingenious use of
expletive. But if you can stomach
it, the words really do fit the foul-
mouthed nature of the music.
“Don’t Cry” is also present on
Illusion IT with an alternate set of
lyrics. This is preceded by “You
Could Be Mine”, a song featured
in the movie Terminator 2. Fi-
nally, //lusion IT closes with “My
World”, a psycho-rap soliloquy
written by Rose. This is definitely
a twist from the G’n’R norm that
may be interesting once or twice,
but past that is an annoying post-
script to'an otherwise decent al-

From The Desk of The IPC:

What Is This Thing About PHISH?

By Chris Hoveland

When it comes to music, are
you tired of, “Yo homey, I’m the
baddest rapper this side of town?”
Tired of, “Roll
away, roll away,
the dew the dew;
roll away roll
away etc. etc.?”
Or how about, “I
gotta tear in my
beer, but I got a
dip in my lip?”
Are you ready for
something new,
but still familiar?
Do you like to
dance? Ordo you
like to just listen
to music? My
solution, as if you
couldn’t guess, is
Phish.

Lately I’ve
heard these three responses toPhish
publicity: (1) “Hoveland, that’s all
you ever talk about!” (2) “Who are
these clowns anyway?” and (3)
“Yeah, I got my ticket yesterday
and I can’t wait for the show.”
What I want to do is turn those

“number two’s” into “number

_three’s. ”

The most important thing to
know about Phish is that they’re
fun. The audience dances to the
high-energy rhythm. Their music
is a diverse selection ranging from
bluegrass, to blues, funk, even
Calypso and Latin jazz, and
straight-up rock-and-roll. Al-
though they’ ve been known toplay
“Whipping Post,” “Highway to
Hell,” and “Touch Me” by The
Doors, Phish is not a cover band.
You might recognize what sounds
like a typical blues or bluegrass
song, but Phish always adds anew

' jazzy element which at first throws

you off, but it's fresh -- a kind of
pleasant surprise.

Phish is unique. All of their
originals are exactly that, original.
You’ ve never heard anything like
them, and nobody but Phish would
be able to play them. Their music

is very new, creative, even weird,
but it is also very good. There is
nothing like Phish (except .possi-
bly The Grateful Dead, a touchy
issue which Ill address later.)

Their specialty is their live
show which often includes a bar-
ber-shop quartet sung a capella,
trampoline-jumping from the gui-
tarist and bassist during the big
jams, bizarre outfits from the drum-
mer who also performs trombone
and vacuum cleaner solos.

Their lyrics are about. . . well,
it’s difficult to say. They’re non-
sensical and generally meaning-
less, but musical, The words sound
good, and they’re funny -- they
will make you laugh as you dance.

Some have compared Phish to
The Grateful Dead; in fact, some
have even abandoned the Dead to
follow Phish. The two bands have
afew things incommon: bothcele-

brate different styles of musical

composition and arrangement; both
are “into” jazz; their music serves

bum.

Well, there you have it. Use
Your Illusion I and I] are here, and
they’re all over the place. Never
before have record stores opened
at 12:01 a.m. to sell an album re-
leased that day, and most of these
places were sold out before a few
hours. Personally, I feel that
Guns’N’Roses should have con-
solidated the albums into a double
album (disc). That means less time
of recording, and any continuity
between the two albums would
remain intact. At times the band
seems to have placed a track on the
albums without much forethought
and with the sole intention of fill-
ing more time. Plus, the packaging
issue over the release of two sepa-
rate albums was quite heated be-
tween G’n’R, Geffen Records, and
environmentalist groups. But I
strongly recommend Use Your II-
lusion I, and I guess Illusion II as
well. And, hell, it would be point-
less to by one without the other.

as a means for escape, as opposed
to a politically active variety; mu-
sicianship is a high priority (per-
haps “musical virtuosity” is a bet-
ter term, particularly for Phish).
Another _ re-
sponse I’ve heard
when publicizing
Phish is, “I’ve never
heard anything of
theirs.” That’s be-
cause they’re from
Burlington, Ver-
mont, and didn’t
make it down south
until last summer.
-Another reason
is that their album,
Lawn Boy is on a
small New England
label. Several major
recording companies
have been begging
Phish to sign with
them, but because Phish has been
successful totally on their own,
and because they want to maintain
theirartistic freedom and stay close

-to their devoted fans, they have

been very cautious and reluctant to
becomecommercialized. Chances
are that Phish could sign ona major
label soon, which is all the more
reason to catch them now while
they’re young and on the cutting
edge.

Phish is fun. Phish is good.
Phish at Davidson is inexpensive -
- at $4, that’s about 1/3 their usual
charge. Even if you’ venever heard
anything by them before, it’s only
a $4 risk plus a few hours, but trust
me, it will be well worth it. Don’t
hesitate -- there are many folks in

‘the public who will snatch up these

tickets in no time.

Go by the ticket office any
week day between 2 p.m. and 5
p.m., and get fired-up for the big-
gest Davidson College concert
event of the year.
