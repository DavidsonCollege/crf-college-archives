Davidson institutes first co-ed hall

After more than a year of debate, men and women find common ground

By Tim SAINnTSING

After almost a year of heated
debate, Davidson gets its first taste
of co-ed living in its sohomore
housing.

The first floor of Akers Resi-
dence Hall, settled beneath the trees
in what is typically referred to as

“Sophomore Nation,” is the site of -

this co-ed concept. One-half of the
floor is dedicated to sophomore

men and the other, separated by a
doorway, to women.

The situation was necessary
as last year’s freshman class was
the largest ever to arrive at
Davidson. “It was a real easy call
for us when the housing numbers
got pretty tight for men and when
we needed the extra space,” says
Director of Residence Life Kurt
Holmes.

Yet the controversy began be-
fore the arrival of the class of 1998.

World Wide Web

takes us

This summer Davidson Col-
lege erected its street sign on the
information highway. The Com-
puter Services Center (CSC) and
the College Relations Office, to-
gether with the support of Presi-
dent Kuykendall, launched the
Davidson “home page” on the
World Wide Wéb-on August I of
this year.

Response-to-date has met ex-
pectations and coordinators are
excited about this new information
resource available to Davidson stu-
dents and others alike.

The World Wide Web is a
decentralized group of multiple
computer servers throughout the
world, While it in itself is quite
large, it comprises only a portion
of what is known as the Internet,
the worldwide network of com-
puter systems which are, one way
or another, linked together.

The term “Davidson home

“on-line”

page” refers to an interface that
computer users around the world
will see if they connect with
Davidson’s server. It consists of
several graphics, including the col-
lege logo, combined with menus
allowing users to pursue the infor-
mation about the college they want.

Director of College Relations
Jerry Stockdale stated the goal of
Davidson’s Internet connection is

“to take advantage of a new me- -

dium of communication.” In his
opinion, the message is the same;
it is the audience that is changing
and constantly growing larger.

Since the program’s incep-
tion one month ago, Stockdale has
worked as one of two official
“Webmasters,” or Internet post-
masters. Director of Networks
and Systems Marcia Mak] and he
either respond to all e-mail re-
quests they receive for informa-
tion or forward them to someone
who can.

Two years ago, the approval of co-
ed housing by the SGA was denied
by Will Terry, former Dean of Stu-
dents. ‘
, Last year the issue was re-
vived, and two resolutions for co-
ed housing were debated by the
SGA.

One possibility detailed joint-
sex living arrangements in some of
the freshmen dorms.

A second possibility planned
the same housing structure for

sophomores.

The latter choice gained more
support in part because the struc-
ture of the sophomore dorms al-
lows for separate bathrooms, sepa-
rate entrances, and adoor between
the two sections.

“We haven’t done anything
radical with mixing rooms or shar-
ing restrooms,” says Holmes.

Liz Sale, the Resident Assis-
tant on First Akers, agrees with
Holmes’ description of the new

set-up. “There is a giant wall be-
tween the two sections so it’s not
really co-ed ...Yes, it is different,
but it is not any harder.”

The 50-50 split between men
and women is not proving to be
any different for the second-year’
students living on First Akers.

Tehnaz Parakh and Mary
Wampler agree: ‘We really don’t
think we’ re having a different ex-
perience than what everybody else
is experiencing.”

LET THEM EAT CAKE!

First year students Jamie Brown, Kerry Brown, and Jessica Montrella came in as three top
winners of the annual freshman Cake Race held last week. Tired, sweaty, but smiling, they
stand with their cakes as they watch their fellow classmates cross the finish line.

Last week marked the begin-
ning of a new era on the Court: the

wristband era. The term “PCC.

member” is official and seemingly
here to stay. So how did the first
week of the new policy go? The
authors of the plan and students
evaluate how everything went.
Implemenation

This year, only those students
who are willing to wear wristbands
indicating their age will be admit-
ted to Patterson Court parties.

As a precondition for obtain-
ing entry into a party with a wrist-

band, students are required to pos-
sess a Sticker on the back of their
Cat cards. Those who are mem-
bers of a social organization ob-
tained them for free during the first
session of drop-add last week. In-
dependents had the same opportu-
nity but were required to pay a $10
fee.

““Aside from students not be-
ing aware that the stickers were
available, it seems to have gone
fairly well,” says Director of Resi-
dence Life Kurt Holmes. “It was
much better at Rusk on Wednes-
day night than SAE on Monday

“simply because we were able to

work out a lot of the logistics.”

PCC President Steve Shames
adds, “The distribution of the stick-
ers has been the most difficult part.”
Over 80 independents have bought
their stickers thus far, whileShames _
estimates 80 percent of the mem-
bers of houses on Patterson Court
have received their stickers.

“Our challenge lies in getting
the stickers to the remainder of the
students,” says Shames. “We hope
to set up regular hours in the PCC
office to make them available to
students.”
