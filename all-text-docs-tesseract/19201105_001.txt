Tennis Team Takes Two

Out of of Three

Elon and Trinity Fall Before D. C.
Net Artists-—-Wake Forest Wins

The Davidson tennis team, composed
of Ormond, A. C., and Bradley, took the
first trip of the year to Elon, Trinity and
Wake Forest. The trip was a success,
the team winning two out of three
matches.

The tennis “sharks” left here Tues-
day night and on Wednesday played the
strong tennis team of Elon on their
own courts. Bradley played a strong
game and won from the captain of the
Elonites in straight sets. The next
match played was the doubles, and again
the Wildcats were victorious in straight
sets, winning by a margin of 6-2, 6-4.
The match between Ormond and Atchi-
son was incomplete on account of dark-
ness and rain.

The next team to be overcome by the
Wildcats was the Trinity team, who
thought themselves contenders for the
state championship, having beaten the
University of North Carolina and Guil-
ford College. In the doubles Ormond
and Bradley won the match in two sets,
the score being 6-4, 6-4. Bradley won his
match against the captain of the Meth-
odist team, Whitner, in a handy man-
ner, beating him 6-3 and 6-3. Ormond
was beaten by Cornwell, whose net
game was too good to be overcome. The
score of this match was 6-4, 6-4.

In the last match of the trip the Bap-
tists from Wake Forest won both the
doubles and singles. In both cases the
match went three sets, the Davidson
team forcing them to extend themselves
to win. The score in the doubles match
was 4-6, 6-4, 7-5.

Stringfield, of Wake Forest, bested
Bradley in a fast match. Stringfield is
a small man, but he is very quick and
covers a court well. The score in this
match was 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. The match be-
tween Ormond and his opponent was
incomplete on account of darkness, the
score at the end being 6-6.

Sometime this fall or next spring
these teams will be played again, this
time on the Hill.

FLAG TO BE AT
HALF MAST SUNDAY

On Sunday November seventh, Presi-
dent Wilson has ordered that all flags
be placed at half-mast at every military
post in the United States. This sign of
mourning is used as a token of the Na-
tion's participation in the memorial
services held for our soldiers, sailors,
marines and others who lost their lives
in the World War.

It is interesting to note that in: bring-
ing a flag to half-mast it is customary.
to raise it as high as possible and then
lower it to half-mast. In lowering the
flag it should be carried again to the
top then lowered.

FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON
DAVIDSON COLLEGE. DAVIDSON. N. C.. NOVEMBER 5, 1920.

Physical Exercises Form Prominent Feature of Firet Inepection—Company B in Action.

St. Claire Sisters Score
Big Hit

Classical and Popular Music With
Readings Compose Excel-
lent Program

The St. Claire Four—Sisters, the sec-
ond number of the Redpath Lyceum
course, pleased an audience that packed
Shearer Hall Monday night. The ladies
were especially effective ensemble,
whether in instrumental or vocal num-
bers. None of their trios or quartets
failed to please their audience, while the
solo numbers were almost as pleasing.

The sisters, Ella, Mary, Kathleen and
Lillian, won the support of the house
with their “Opening Song,” which was
tuneful and unique. Continuing in vo-
cal quartet the “Show Me” song was
given with a dash and = swing that
brought down the house. The versatil-
ity of the company was shown in the
effective rendition of the famous “Bar-
carolle” from the no less famous “Tales
of Hoffman,” in which the rich contralto
of Miss Lillian was heard to good ad-
vantage.

In “It Takes a Girl to Do It,” Miss
Mary introduced herself as a reader.
As a well merited encore she gave “She
Was Fishing.” Later she attempted
“Scenes From the Studio,” a rather
lengthy discussion of the ways of wom-
en when they are being photographed.
The only impersonation that had the
ring of sincerity was that of the “ro-
mantic school girl.” “He Wouldn't Tell
His Maw,” her last offering, was much
better.

Of the night's offerings none pleased
the house better than the instrumental
quartet numbers. And they were still
more effective when bits of vocal har-
mony were thrown in for good measure.
“Bo-la-bo” and “Swanee” were given
with a will and swing. When Miss Ella
started in on that mouth organ—Boy
howdy! Watch Your Step! And how
about her “religion” in “Ise A-goin’
Home?” The most tuneful bit of the lot
though was the rendition of “Sweet and
Low” by the contralto with stringed ac-
companiment and with the full quartet
on the chorus.

The two violin solos were especially
pleasing and well selected. The first
vocal solo by the soprano, Miss Ella, was
a little ditty about “The First” with
a chairming lilt and a catching refrain.
As an encore she sang a little something
about “Dreams and You and Me.” Later
efiorts of the soprano were not so pleas-

PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK OF
ANNUAL NOW COMPLETED

No, everybody's best girl is. not on the
hill.

“Well, then,” you ask, “what gn earth
is everybody so dressed up about?” That
is surely a reasonable question, for all
the students, from C. K. Brown to D. T.
Mahood, have been strutting around the
campus like best men at a wedding cere-
mony.

An explanation of alt these “pretty
boys” is in reality not at all difficult. The
Annual photographer has been trying
out his camera on the various organiza-
tions, clubs, bands, societies, associa-
tions, etc. of Davidson. Nobody knew
there were more than half a dozen or so,
but when the call was sounded, 35 or-
ganizations volunteered to occupy space
in the coming Annual,

Not. only have the clubs suffered the
trials of “looking sweet" for the cam-
era man, but individuals have also been
called upon to act as victims. The stream
of shiny-faced, slick haired gentlemen
filing in and out of No. 9 Georgia is
proof of the fact that the management
is making real headway in the photo-
graphic lines.

After getting your beauty struck. the
next thing is to produce a “snap” of
your girl. These pictures will be run in
full-page panels, and will compose the
beauty section. Just think how pleased
she'll be, and hand in her picture at once.

Junior-Senior Debaters Chosen Same
Night—Hot Contest for Places

On Tuesday night the preliminaries to
the Junior-Senior debate and at the
same time the preliminaries of the in-
tercollegiate debate were held in the
Philanthropic hall. The subject discuss-
ed was, “Resolved, That the Federal
Government should prohibit the immi-
gration into the United States or any of
its territory, for a period of twenty
years, of Japanese laborers.” On the
affirmative were C. K. Brown, J. H. Mc-
Keithen, A. F. Fricker, D. W. Roberts,
and J. F. Clark. On the negative were
F. V. Long, D. R. Freeman, and C. G.
Long. The contest was one of the most
heated heard in the Philanthropic So-
ciety for several years. Any one of the
contestants would prove a credit to the
society. However, the teams as selected
by the judges from the faculty, were, for

Initial Inspection of R. 0.
C. Very Sa Satisfactory

Company “D” Wins First Place in
Contest for Honors

Last Friday afternoon the first of the |

regular monthly inspections of the R.

T. C. was held. The companies in turn
maneuvered on the athletic field before j
an assembly of students and towns-
people.

Some very intricate drills were under-

taken and all the companies made a re-:
markable showing, considering the fact:
that 60 per cent of cach company never |
have had drill before coming to David-,

son, They did well for soldiers of a
month and a half who are not subjected
to intensive training by any means.

A special squad from cach company
drilled in the gym. Dr. Fraser Hood
was the judge of this drill, and in the
maneuvers outside, Captain Hearn, Dr.
JW. McConnell and Major Rogers
were the judges.

The judges decided that the honors of
the day should go to Company D, com-
manded by Captain Romefelt. B Com-
pany, under Captain Boulware, was
next, and Captain McCaskill’s Company
C was next. A Company, Captain
Mitchell commanding, won two first
places, but lost out in the drill and came
last.

gram.

No. 9

Davidson Downs the Cit-
adel in Classy Contest

Bulldogs Put Up Cle Clean and Plucky
Fight but are Unable to Stop
Victorious Wildcats

The Citadel Bulldogs and Davidson
Wildcats did battle last Saturday at
Wearn Field, the result being a 27 to 13
victory for the Red and Black machine.

Davidson entered the fray handicapp-
ed by the loss of three of her first
string men due to the S. I. A. A. rulings
and two regulars duc to injuries, but
this loss was overcome by the push and
plucky fighting of the Presbyterians.

Although the game went against the
Bulldogs continually they put up an un-
daunted spirit which netted two touch-
downs for them in the course of the
game; their last and second goal was
won during the last three minutes of
play. when the shades of evening were
falling so fast it was hard to distinguish
the different men in the scramble.

The outstanding feature of the game
was the spirit of fair play and clean
sportsmanship, which was clearly shown
by both contestants.

In the first quarter neither team suc-
ceeded in pushing the pig skin over the
goal line. The ball was worked up and
down the held with little advantage to
cither side. Clary got away ‘around
| right end with a 15 yard run for David-
son and Jarvis ran 20 yards for Citadel.
These runs were the main features for
that quarter.

In the second quarter Davidson made
her first touchdown after Kullock had
‘kicked 3o yards into Davidson's ter-
ritory. The ball was returned, Shepherd
taining 3 yards; Douglas 2 yards; Me-

Fadden pass to Clary 32 yards and Mc-
Fadden carrying the ball over in the
/Wext play by a short run around right
end. Brady kicked goal. :

Another touchdown

was gained in
this period when the Bulldogs re-
ceived but failed to gain. Kullock

kicks and Davidson advanced the ball
with a 20 yard run by Bethea, through
the line, t§ yards around left end by
Clary, 12 yards and over the goal by
Bethea. Brady again kicking goal.

In the third period Citadel resorted to
foreward passes and kicking. Kullock’s
short kicks gave the Wildcats their op-
portunity and after a bad kick Davidson
received the ball on the 20 yard line and
fater a 5 yard line plunge Shepherd
went through tackle for the third touch-
;down. Brady kicking goal in his usual
manner. In this quarter the Bulldogs
succeeded in putting one over when
Jarvis received a fumbled ball and ran
60 yards for their first touchdown.
Kullock kicked goal.

Iu the fourth quarter the Wildcats
‘pushed the Bulldogs back early in the
‘quarter and Long who substituted in
ithe back field after consistent gains
carried the ball around end for David-
son’s final touchdown. Brady failed to
kick this goal. During the last few
minutes of play Citadel received the ball
