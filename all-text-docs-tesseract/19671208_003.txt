Complaints Dished Out To Slater ~*~ —
_In Hash Over Food And Service

By BOB TRAVERS
Associate Editor

The food served and the
service at the College Union
has elicited many complaints
recently.

Complaints have included
informal, private grumbling
and formal complaints to
Klaus Kleeberg, cafeteria
manager for ARA-Slater Food
Service.

Two students who lodged a
lengthy complaint with Klee-
berg charged that service in
the cafeteria is unnecessarily
slow and that the food served
is poor.

They complained that
menus showed little imagi-
nation, and there was little
variety in the food served.

Senior Price Cameron point-
ed out that pork and ham-
burger have been served sev-
eral times a week for two or
three weeks and that vegeta-
bles suffer the same lack of
variety.

He also complained of an
overabundance of starches at

most meals, claiming, that
such items as spaghetti, po-
tatees and corn have not in-
frequently been served in
the same meal. _

Kleeberg said that corn is
not a starch.

Senior Ken Scott, who has
served as head waiter for
Slater - sponsored banquets,
commented, ‘‘It seems as if
banquets and people from
other schools take precedence
over Davidson students. When
there’s a banquet, the food
served students suffers.”

These students also voiced
several complaints about the
snack bar. They charged that
prices are too high, especial-
ly for ice cream, and that
service is poor because Klee-
berg has employed few count-
er workers.

Kleeberg said that no profit
is made off the snack bar,
so that prices could not be
lowered.

When students complained
about the quality of meat
served at a recent meal,

Kleeberg said that it was
U. S. Choice grade but ad-
mitted that there were bet-
ter qualities of meat which
he could serve.

Senior Bill Farr later point-
ed out that U.S. Choice meat
is a label which says nothing
about the quality but merely
certifies that it has been
properly processed.

Senior Tom Pope complain-
ed that a meal—meat, two

vegetables, salad. dessert,
milk, coffee—when purchas-
ed singly, costs 88 cents on a
weekday noon, $1.03 at night
and $1.29 on Sunday, even
when the same meal is serv-
ed each time.

Other students complained
about not being able to get
any food if they were a few
minutes late for a meal even
if food remained on the steam
tables.

Graduates Face

He spoke at Sigma. Alpha Epsilon on

“The Expansion of Consciousness,” the
final discussion in the ‘“‘Blow-Up ’67”
series.

Williams, assistant professor of
French, said there are “limits to that
which is knowable. However, most of
us refuse to accept these limits.” He
defined “expansion of consciousness”
as man’s departure from these limits
and his contact with higher reality.

Williams began with the pre-Renais-

Williams questioned the value of
modern drug use, particularly LSD and
mescalin, for expansion of conscious-

Control Of Lingle Manor
May Be Changed Again

Lingle Manor, seemingly

Freshman Council after be
ing abandoned last month by
the Lingle Manor group, may
change hands again.

The College Union Board.

meeting Monday night at the
Manor, tentatively decided to
apply for control of the build-
ing.

The Manor's facilities were
first turned over to the
Freshman Countil last week
by the Student Council, which
took over ‘the Manor's treas-
ury and facilities when its
members voted to disband.

B. A. Aiken, president of
the Union, said Monday, how-
ever, that since the building

- is college property, the de-
cision on its fate should be-
long instead to the college.
He said that this was the
position being taken by the
faculty Committee on the Col-
lege Union, Fraternities, and
Social Life.

The board tentatively de-
cided to apply to the com-
mittee for control of the
Manor.

Meanwhile the freshmen,
who also met Monday to re-
consider the matter, agreed
that the group with the best

proposals should get the

building and suggested a
compromise solution based
on a joint Union-Freshman
Council board.

“If they (the Union Board)

hav¢ got better ideas, we
shoilld relinquish our right to
run \he/filace."’ said Fresh-

man Council President Steve
Engstrom.

Engstrom called for a
freshman subcommittee to
draw up a proposal of its
own to be sent to the faculty
committee.

The freshmen and the Un-
ion have drawn up similar
plans for the Manor's use.

“It should be a place where
you can go and not feel com-
pelled to do anything,”’ said
Ed Embree, vice-president of
the Union. He suggested
study and music listening
rooms upstairs and lounges
downstairs.

A possible compromise so-
lution was discussed last
night by Embree’s subcom-
mittee, Engstrom, freshman
Union Board representative
Jule Young and Interfraterni-
ty Council President Gus
Cochran.

The college has agreed to
make a $200 grant to renovate
the building, Engstrom said,
as well as to pay for main-

federal relations for the
American Council of Educa-
tion, was quoted in ‘‘The
Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion’ as saying ‘‘virtually
all” students graduating from
American schools next year
could be drafted.

Hight said he did not think
there has been a drop in
graduate school applications
by Davidson students because

of the probability of the’

draft.

He stated, however, that
“thousands of young men
getting bachelor’s degrees
this year will be getting
drafted next year,"’ and that
the boys ‘who do not have to
worry are those who are. al-
ready in advanced ROTC.”

Morse said that the draft
call for next year would be
between 2,000 and 3,000 and
said that under the present
procedure the oldest men eli-
gible must be inducted first.

Hight said that this would
result in ‘‘a drop in enroll-
ment in graduate school.”
He also urged any student
thinking about going to
graduate school, but worried
about the draft, to take the
examinations required for
application now. He felt that
a higher score would be
made than if they were taken
at a later date.

He reminded any such stu-
dent that ‘‘even though he
may be physically fit and
acceptable for the draft now.
he has no assurance that he
will remain that way."

Hight felt that ‘in 1970
there will be a rush of stu-
dents to get into graduate
school."’ He believes that the
war will be over by 1970 and
that the draft call will not
be as high.

Decision Delayed

On Chapel Cuts

Chaplain Scott Woodmansee’s proposal for fewer chapels
and assemblies has not been considered yet by the Faculty
Religious Policy Committee, due to the uncertainty about the

1967 68 academic calendar.

Woodmansee said this week
that it now appears that no
action will be taken on the
proposal until after the meet-
ing of the Board of Trustees.
Dec. 20.

It would be impossible, ac-
cording to Woodmansee. to
consider the proposed
changes without knowledge
of the class schedule and
calendar.

The proposal under consid-
eration would cut the num-
ber of periods allotted to
chapels to two per week. The
chaplain would be résponsi
ble for obtaining the speaker
for one period. while the Stu-

dent Council and other cam.
pus organizations could ,utili-
ize the other assembly pe-
riod.

Woodmansee said although
there would be no budget in-
creases for the chapel pro-
grams, Davidson would be
able to obtain better speak-
ers. since there would be
fewer speakers.

Woodmansee cited another
problem caused by the un-
certainty about next year's
calendar, He said that he
has been unable to contact
speakers because he cannot
give them a definite time or
date to speak.

What should be done in

alternative. (2) A representa

up in Saigon. He said that
there would not be an honor-

war has strengthened the
pro-Chinese faction in the
Hanoi government.

In the South, the majority
are for peace now, though
the NLF does have genuine
support of many people where
they are in control. The
U. S. wants the NLF to take
a “back-seat’’—this is un-
realistic, Rau said.

“The present Saigon gov-
ernment is so weak that if
the NLF were. accepted as
the principal party on the
other side the decision would
be made by the U. S. and
NLF,’’ Rau said. Neverthe-
less Rau feels that an inter-
national guarantee would be
needed.
