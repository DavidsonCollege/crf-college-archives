Tuition increased

By AARON LEVINE

In February the Davidson Col-
lege Board of Trustees approved
an increase in tuition and fees
along with the 1987-88 budget.
- Tuition. will be $8,985, Room
(double) will be $1,350, Board
(nineteen meal plan) will be
$1,635, Student Activity and So-
cial will be $110, and the laundry
fee will be $316. The total com-
prehensive fee for next year will
be $12,390.

President Kuykendall main-
tained that the percentage increase
for this year’s comprehensive
fees — 8.3% — is the lowest in

four years. Although the budget.

increase for next year is 11.1%, he
said this reflects the need to imple-
ment programs which have been
endorsed by the Board to help in-
sure Davidson’s

quality liberal

arts education. :
It should be pointed out tha
the cost of education can not be
defined in terms of the Consumer
Price Index (C.P.I.). Colleges
like Davidson expend their funds
on different goods and services
than the average American con-
sumer. Many of the expenditures
of colleges today are in areas like
high technology which are not
part of the ordinary C.P.I. For
Davidson, recent increases in
costs of computerization, insur-
ance, and energy have made cer-
tain parts of the budget volatile.
Money for areas like these has
to come from the only elastic part
of the budget, at least for David-
son, which is the tuition and fees
structure. Perhaps the rise in tui-
tion and fees for an independent
college like Davidson can be un-

present calendar inhibits the kind

Emanon house
shuts down

By BETSY BRYAN

A lack of members will force
Emanon, one of Davidson’s two
remaining co-ed eating houses, to
close completely next fall; how-
ever, a successful fundraiser at the
end of winter term will allow
Emanon to remain open as a social
house for the remainder of spring
term.

According to Mike Stephens,
treasurer, “Someone, who wants
to remain anonymous, donated as
many ski tickets as we could sell,
up to 500. At $10 each, we had the
potential to make $5000. We actu-

| ally made $3000, but if we’d had

more time, I think we could have
sold $5000 worth. We didn’t need
the money in that we could have
covered our debts without it, but it
gave us some options for spring
term.”

On Tuesday night, the mem-
bers of Emanon met and decided
what to do with the sum. Part of it
will go to their cook, Hollis
Moore, who Stephens says has
been “absolutely fantastic.” The
remainder will go toward social
activities Emanon has planned for
spring term such as_ Beach
Weekend. After a private auction

of house property such as micro-
waves and a TV, Stephens expects
to have “several hundred” dollars
left at the end of the year, and this
money will go to the Indian child
Emanon sponsors. .

Stephens says that no matter
how much money the sale of ski
tickets had raised, Emanon would
have had to close next year. The
problem was not insolvency but
lack of members: “With just 37
members. and 6 people who self-
selected, it just wasn’t practical
for us to continue to serve food.”

Stephens attributes the de-
crease in membership to a change
in the social atmosphere at David-
son. “The houses on the Court are
the same, but the social environ-
ment of Davidson has changed in
the past few years. When it

“opened in the early 70s with PAX,
ETC and the other co-ed. houses,:
Emanon was going strong. Up
until 1982, there was a waiting list
to get in. But now for some
reason, people are heading back to
the frats and single-sex houses.
Since the administration doesn’t
allow purely social houses on the
Court, it looks like this spring will
be Emanon’s last term.”

Semester change proposed

By DAVID WILLIAMS ~

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC), chaired by Vice
President for Academic Affairs
Robert Williams, submitted to the
faculty for review last month a
draft proposal that would replace
the current three-term calendar

_with an early semester 15-week
credit-hour calendar. The propo-

sal states that “the present cur-
riculum and calendar . . . must
now be significantly changed” to
implement the goals articulated in
the college’s Statement of Pur-
pose and 1985-86 Strategic Plan. -
The proposal also includes a rede-
finition of the core curriculum re-
quirements and measures to
strengthen the junior and senior
year.

“I think our sense is that the

*

of independent learning — out-
side of the classroom — that we
would like to encourage,” Wil-
liams said. “For most subjects, we
believe that time to absorb and to
think about-what has been learned
in the classroom, as well as time to

.do more reading, more writing,

and more research, is what the
present system discourages. We
believe that by stretching out the
calendar from ten to fifteen
weeks, and by having classes
meet every other day, we would
allow more time for that kind of
learning.”

The EPC proposal calls for the
first fifteen-week semester to
begin in late August and conclude
before Christmas, while the sec-

‘ond semester would begin shortly

after the New Year and conclude
in early May. Classes would nor-

mally meet three times a week for
fifty minute periods or twice a
‘week for seventy-five minute
periods and would carry three
hours of credit. Each semester
would be divided by one week of
vacation and would be followed
by a reading day and a week of
exams.

Under the proposed calendar
students would take a normal load
of 25.5 hours per year, meaning
an average of slightly over four
courses per semester. Faculty
members would have the option of
teaching one-hour and two-hour
courses. Computer programming
courses, applied music courses,
science laboratories, and theater
studio workshops would carry one
hour of credit. First-year foreign
languages and Humanities, which
