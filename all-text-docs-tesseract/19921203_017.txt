Gull's Nest ... Bill Gullan
On Not Knowing

What to Write About

I like writing a column, but I
really don’t like taxing my mind.
When the time comes every week,
I put on Sinatra, look out the win-
dow, and it comes to me. No luck
this week. I went to the smoking
room of the library, but it was too
hot. I asked liberal friends of mine
to get me riled up,-but that too
failed. I asked for suggestions
from people on my hall, on the hall
below, in the lunchline, and even
the paintball guy who kept pester-
ing me tobuy tickets. Itjust wasn’t
going to happen this week.

Sure, [could blame Frampton
for giving me too little time, Icould
blame the soccer team and drop/
add for stealing the attention from
the normal issues, or I could even

blamethe stress of exams (although:

ithasn’ treally hitme). I’velearmed
that when you have a mental and
intellectual contradiction to check
your premises. One has to look
beneath the consequences and to
the causes. Why don’t I have an
idea this week?

It could be that there aren’t
any burning issues on campus. I
could have chosen to attack apa-
thy, but I am basically apathetic
about everything except politics
and the two-party system (one in
the morning and one at night).
Come to think of it, there is apathy
on this campus. However, apathy
is often good. Instead of turning
molehills into mountains and
bitching (I guess I can use this
word) about every little thing, we
reserve our wrath for such impor-
tant issues as Bonus Bucks. I’ve

spoken to friends whose campuses
have demonstrations and violence
and all that kind of stuff. It would
be an experience to go to that type
of place, but would one be able to
study, party, and exist in relative
solitude? I would also end up

being killed for having a mouth -

bigger than my biceps. Ourkind of
apathy is not indifference, but self
control.

I might have writer’ s block
this week because I refuse to com-
plain in print. If you have a prob-
lem, go to the person who can
solve it. The letter to the editor
regarding me this semester is a
pure example of my point. It is
very cowardly to wait a week and
write a letter to the newspaper in-
stead of walking up two flights of
steps and confronting something
or someone you find offensive. I
had a beef with one of the Humani-
ties lecturers, and I discussed it
with him. That is how to find a
solution, oratleast be heard. Drop/

,add is a pain, optional classes are

not optional, the alcohol policy is
confusing at best, and Clinton is
going to be a total disaster; but if
one writes a column or letter about
these problems, it usually winds
up being a newspaper dialog with
no actual discussion and no solu-
tion reached. Nobody wants to
listen to a.constant complainer.
I’m sorry that I have had little
to offer this week besides a run-
ning narration of my thought pro-
cess. Anyway, good luck to the
guy’s soccer team, take your prob-
lems to the right places, and take

__ pride in your apathy.

countenance of Dr. Sentelle, take another right and head back to your
carrel. Or if you’rea fitness nut, try multiple floors: down the steps, past
CHAL and the happy reference librarians, hang a left, then a right, and
say hello to Dr. Holland. Through the magazines, back up the stairs and

to your seat for a quick breather.

5. One of my favorites: trying to make something out of the wood-
grain designs in your carrel. Kind of like cloud-gazing. Carrel-gazing.

6. Talking to people. Hey, if can’ t'get something done, why should
anyone else? It’s called “Dropping the Curve.”

7. Attempt to understand the titles on the foreign books surrounding
you. Or try to figure out why someone would write some of the English

ones.

8. Check the second floor directory to see what clever messages the
work-study students have been able to construct from the available

letters.

9. If you’re feeling rebellious, import food items from the emo or

smoker's lounge.

10. Lose weight. Is itjust me, or has the library turned into seaunk?
Just watch the pounds drip away and the writing blur on the page.
Well, I’m stressed from all this study avoidance. Think I'll take a

Spear lines up for the free kick
deep in N.C. State’s own zone. He
hits it, sending the ball just to the
corner of the six where it falls,
bounces off about three players
and finally settles in front of Rob
Ukrop who simply pushes the ball
_into the goal. Every player on the
field immediately turns around,
running toward the fence to hug
the crowd which is jumping over
the fence to hug the players.

I charge into the oncoming
red jerseys slowing up to jump
Craig Omli (one of the cutest play-
ers, don’t you think girls?) when a
Charlotte Observer photographer
captures the essence of whatmakes
this Davidson soccer team so good:
me. The next day they pay hom-
age by putting my picture (witha
few other inconsequential people
in the background) ‘on the front
page of the whole paper.

Well, ok, maybe I’m not re-
sponsible for the team's success,
but I know I have something to do
with it, because every time one of
them gets the ball a few hundred
Davidson students and I tell him
‘ what to do with it. Plus, I know I
must be a member of the team
because I think I might blow chunks
on the three closest people every
time we get near the goal or Deegan
(he’s cute, too, huh?) does some
Spiderman thing to save a shot.

e Truly itis a great feeling to be

(Frampton Rules... |
Go Davidson Soccer Team

able to watch such a wonderful
spectacle. Never did I think that a
Davidson team would be in the
position the guys’ soccer team is.
They can win the National Cham-

Chris Frampton

pionship (knock on wood). I mean
everybody starts offthe season with
the possibility of winning the thing,
but teams like Coastal, UCLA,
Duke, State, and San Diego can
never say they had a legitimate
chance at the thing.

Plus they pay their players.
Ours pay the school to allow them
to play Davidson soccer. Oh, and
they get an alright education be-

_ same. I don’t know if you’ve

tween practices.

I remember walking to the
UNCC field from the parking
lot, which is further away than
satellite is from Belk, and think-
ing that this was the real McCoy.
There were so many people.
Police had to direct traffic and
the line to the ladies’ bathroom
actually came out of the door.

This weekend will be the

ever been in the bathrooms at
Richardson Field, but they don’t
hold eight thousand people.
Maybe they could bring in some
of those blue things. I don’t
know why I’m writing about this
either.

Basically, I just wanted to
thank the soccer players for mak-
ing this such an exciting season.
It is a treat to watch them play,
taking out schools five times our
size that receive scholarships. It
bringsacertain pride to Davidson
tohave one of our teams perform
onanational level. It is appreci-
ated.

Now, I can’t wait for bas-
ketball, where I-hope the team
can pull off. the same sort of
dreams. Then I want diving and
swimming, tennis, field hockey,
tugby, football, baseball, golf,
women’s soccer and basketball,
wrestling, and debate to do =]

same sort of thing.

Travis Hinson and Rafael Candelario:
Brothers on Hookin’'

T-Yo Rafrod, have. you ever
hooked?
R-HOOKED!!??? Not to my
knowledge!
T-You mean to tell me that you
have never went down... on the
court of course, to party and get
lucky enough to find some drunk
female, lure her back to your room
and have your way with her?
_R-Yo Rock, you must be crazy!
Firstof all, due to obvious reason(s)
I’m not as fortunate as my fellow
Davidson classmates. And sec-
ondly, I will never, and have never
taken advantage ofadrunk woman,
even when I had the chance. That
is dangerous. Mr. Charlie would
throw me underneath the jail!
T-I congratulate you on not taking
advantage of any poor drunken
souls; however, for some’of my
other classmates, I wonder where
your morals are. If you thought of
the young lady as someone’s little
sister, maybe even your own, you
would think twice about your ac-

they know me, NOT!!!) _
R-Word! But you know what
amazes-me?My-female-friends
complain 24/7 about how the guys
treat them like crap, but still here
comes the weekend and where do
they go? Yep, straight to the court!
And by Monday, youcan goto any
male hall or frat and hear who did
what! Then the next weekend ap-
proaches and the women put them-
selves through that torture once
again!
T-I guess it’s true what they
say(whgever the hell "they" are!),
that nice guys finish last. But Raf’,
tell the truth, I know you’ve had
some play haven’t you??!!
R-Well...O.K., aside from the three
women I dated here, I kissed two
Davidson women on the court in
the last3 1/2 years. And yes, itwas
totally random, but I did not make
the first move, and they were not
drunk.
T-Pure curiosity, my lonely friend.
And Mr. Charlie knows about that

‘desire to engage in hooking (not
that it’s an option) or anything else
the court offers, from a BLACK
perspective, the social life at
Davidson really doesn’thave much
to offer.

R-Maybe not, but we always have
our books! And they’re our friend
to the very end.

Oh, I’'dliketo senda shout out
to the soccer team. Congrats! By
the way, the BSC would have vol-
unteered to usher like the other
houses and organizations, but just
like court tours we were left out
and not asked which makes us look
like separatists.

T-Sho ya right! We know the
players had nothing to do with it.
It’s like I told you last week Raf,
it’s a conspiracy by Mr. Charlie.
(Not Coach Slagle.) One more
thing people, the next time you feel -
like hookin’, watch out “cause they
might be cooking!!!
