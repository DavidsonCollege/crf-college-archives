‘WE'RE GOING TO WIN’

Soccermen Face
Apps & Pfeiffer |

The Davidson soccer team faced one of its tougher |. ~
opponents of the season when Appalachian visited here|:

today and encounters even stififer competition at Pfeif-

fer Tuesday.

Last year both Appalachian
and Pfeiffer defeated Davidson,
but coach Harry Fogleman is
looking forward to a_ victory
over Appalachian and a tougher
contest with Pfeiffer,

Fogleman said, ‘‘First we are
going to win this one Friday.”

The game Tuesday looms as
one of the year’s major contests
as the Wildcats face a mighty
Pfeiffer squad. ‘I've talked to
some of the officials in the area
and they feel that Pfeiffer has
the best team in the state. Com-

paring scores shows that David-
son defeated St. Andrews 4-2

while Pfeiffer downed them];

12-0,"" Fogleman remarked.

The Wildcats are having their
troubles with injuries. Fogleman
said that two players are still
limping from the Duke game.
One, Juergen Schroder, is ex-
pected to play, but the other,
Bob Lanier, will not.

The Duke contest gave David-
son its only setback, setting the
record thus far at 5-1.

SOCCER .. . FINNEY
“You're going to be doing all the work, you say

where,”

Head Soccer Coach Harry Fogleman

chuckled to me and his small audience of fresh-
man soccer boys, yesterday.

“Okay, we'll talk in the shade,” I said as we
walked off the soccer field toward the steps lead-
ing up to the road below the football stadium.

In particular, Fogleman corrected an earlier

column |] wrote when

quoted Coach Lefty Driesell

and called Fred Hetzel Davidson's first All-Ameri-

can in anything.

In 1960 Claude Finney was an

All-American goalie for Dr. Paul Marrotte’s David-

son soccermen.

“I understand Finney was about my height,”
Fogleman rambled “He was five feet tall and five
feet broad, a squatty fellow; but he had huge hands,

and he was quick.

“And rough. He’d ‘roll’ anybody that got near

the goal.

Sometimes he'd take out two or three.

“They weren't undefeated then, but he only al-
lowed a fantastic number of goals, something like

two the-whole season.”

t that time Fogleman’s star fullback and

to ta

Ab
freshivany soccer coach, Glenn Hanes, walked over
about Finney, argue about soccer, and add

anything he could to the conversation.

FRESHMEN

From Finney, Fogleman (and now Hanes) be-
gan talking about the freshman squad, who recent-
ly took Myers Park 3-1 in a practice game.

“This is the best group of freshmen I’ve seen

since I've been here,” Fogleman beamed. “There
are about eight who'll be playing varsity ball here.
Wouldn't you say so Glenn?”

. “Eight, maybe ten, real good ones,” Hanes re-
plied. “You want some names?”

“Yeah, I'll take some—who’s good?” I asked.

“Greg Simmons, Harry Hamil, Joe Norton, Jim
Marrow, Jim Lehman, and others.” Hanes rattled
off. “You want more—oh yeah, Alec Neisler, don’t
forget Neisler. He got two goals in the Myers Park
game. I could give you some more... .”

“Well, you can just say ‘others’, many ‘others’,
if you’d rather,” Fogleman broke in. “What's that
boy’s name over there?”

As Fogieman pointed Hanes started rattling off
names again. “That's Miller, Bayard Miller, you
might mention him. And Ben Martin .. .”

So the freshmen appear to have some soccer
players. Between Fogleman and Hanes nearly the
whole team got praise.

CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT

As we left babbling about freshman footmen,
and Hanes ran off to dress out for practice Fogle-
man turned his attention to the Southern Confer-
ence Soccer Tournament to be held here next month
on the 19th and 20th.

“We're going to have a round robin, single elim-
ination tournament,” Fogleman informed me; a sin-
gle elimination tournament probably involving not
only Davidson, but also West Virginia, Furman, East
Carolina, and maybe George Washington (assuming
they'll show their faces after Homer's crew white-
washes them this weekend).

The championship game of this tournament is
scheduled for Saturday, November 20, at 11, before
the Wofford game.

“We'll probably be the favored team,” Fogle-
man forecasted. ‘We're the only team to win a con-
ference game (over Furman 2-0), so if there's a bye
or something like that, we ought to get it.

SECOND FIDDLE

Playing second fiddle to football, Davidson soccer
has never received the enthusiasm that some of its
toughest opponents can fire themselves with. Pfeif-
fer, Tuesday’s opponent, has the best soccer team
in the state—but no football.

“You ought to see them,” Fogleman smiled.
“They'll have a band and cheerleaders, just like our
football. Belmont Abbey is the same way.

“Once at Campbell we played before 3000 peo-
ple, then a couple of years ago we played Emory
at their homecoming. They decorated the campus
for us then.”

Fogieman meandered toward the soccer goai
as we finished. I left the 5-1 Booters pounding
leather balls onto a wooden wall readying for Ap-
palachian.

Next week will tell the
story in this fall’s flickerball
scramble when the Betas
and the Kapoa Sigs clash
Wednesday afternoon. Both
teams finished this weck
with perfect records.

The Betas. led by speedy Sam
Cathey, downed the Pikas yes-

menting on the game, Cathey
stated. ‘‘We didn't look all that
sharp, but when the chips were

had a good afternoon, stopping
the Pikas twice on the one foot
line.

In their only game of the
week, the Kappa Sigs edged the
Pl Kapps 36-28. Cary Kettner
a Pi Kapp back, described the
action by saying. ‘‘We had them
worried.” The score was tied
at the half, and the Sigs waited
until the last three minutes to
cinch thelr umpteenth straight
victory.

Neal Martin scored twice for
the losers, with Tuck Jones,
Cary Kettner. and Paul Curlee
also turning in fine perform-
ances. The Sigs were led by
Jamie Bryant and Tommy Cox.

The Sigma Chis also downed
the Pi Kapps this week by a
convinving score of 31-7. The
Machis exploded in the first
half, scoring all five of their
touchdowns.

“We've only practiced ten

Organize
’66 Team

Thirteen men have achieved
positions on Davidson's 1966 Var-
sity Tennis Squad,
to a statement
Coach Harry Fogleman recent-
ly.

Stated Coach Fogleman, ''This
is the largest tennis squad we
have ever had, but. this is due
to a great number of excellent
tennis players in school"

Those who have made. the
team are seniors Bill Coucil,
Woody Cleveland, Dich Hurd,
and Jeff Frank: juniors Esmond
Phelps, Peter Parrott, and Geor-
die Mueller and sophomores
Woody Faulk, Pinky Hatcher,
Frank Bass, Dan Hearon, and
Charles Orr.

‘surface the specified one month
of curing time, the courts will
probably not be opened for use
until after Thanksgiving recess.

“This brings our total number
of tennis courts to 16, and we
do have room by the four new
courts to add another court
when financia’ considerations
will allow us to do so."’ remark-

this year,’ he says, “‘is that

For Davidson practice con.

of sweaty uniforms means that

ed Dr. Scott.

“Furthermore, these all-
weather courts have conduits in-
stalled around them so that in
the future we can add lights for
night play,"” he added.

The athletic department has
also received a $50,000 challenge
grant from the Richardson
Foundation for improvements to
Richardson Field. The decision
was made to convert the present
baseball field into a parking
area for stadium events, and
consequently some of the Rich-
ardson money was appropriated
for relocation of the baseball
field.

Improvements to Richardson
Field itself have already begun,
with the sandblasting of the
stands, the installation of fiber-
glass seats, the construction of
a new press box, and the renova.
lion of the dressing rooms and
rest rooms in the west stands
having been recently completed.

Finally. to alleviate the pre
sent cramped IMAC schedule.
which requires three Nickerball
games a day for five days each
week in order to complete the
schedule before cold. weather.
the college has constructed a
large. intramural field north of
the soccer field. The area has
been seeded and will be avail
able for IMAC use beginning
with softball in the spring.

Coach Heath Whittle pointed
out that this year’s team is not
as well balanced as last year's.
He added, ‘‘Andy has run the
best time for a Davidson man
on this course since 1962."

Last Tuesday the thinclads fell
to VMI and East Carolina. Little
took top honors ih the meet at
21:48, a time which would have
placed fifth in last year’s South-
ern Conference meet. After the
race he could only say that he
was tired.

The score against VMI was
21-37 while the ECC score was
25-30. Placing behind Little were
Jesse Sims, Jim McLaughlin.
Bobby Myers, John Morris and
Richard Allen.

The squad gets its last chance
of the season to win a dual meet
when it entertains High Point
Tuesday, Nov. 9. Coach Whittle
expressed confidence of a good
showing if the squad can stay
healthy.
