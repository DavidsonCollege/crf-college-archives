Davidson’s two literary societies, the
Philanthropic and the Eumenean, were
founded in 1837. They have been,
throughout the history of the college, in-
fluential in many lines, especially in de-
bating and public speaking. In former
years the magazine was under their
sponsorship and management, while for |
a time after the foundation of the col-|
lege theirs were all that Davidson had in
the way of a library.

Though the scope of their activities
has been reduced, the literary societies

still serve to develop a phase of college
life which is too often neglected in these |
days of the magazine and newspaper, |

that of public speaking. In them men |

are given the opportunity to take part!

in debates and to deliver declamations |
and orations, all of which help to train |

“Pure Thoughts” was the subject of

Dr. Hugh R. Murchison’s address at the}

Y vespers Sunday evening. Dr. Murchi-
son is an alumnus of this institution, be-
ing a member of the class of ’93, and now
head of Biblical Instruction in the Uni-
versity of South Carolina, having for-
merly been connected with Columbia
Seminary.

Dr. Murchison chose for his text Philip-
pians 4:7, 8: “And the peace of God which
passeth all understanding shall guard
your hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus.

Finally, brethren, whatsoever things
are true, whatsoever things are honor-
able, whatsoever things are pure, what-
soever. things are lovely, whatsoever

things are of good ‘report; if there be}

any virtue and if there be any praise,
think on these things.”

He went on to show that psychology
has proven that we can regulate our
thoughts just as we can regulate our eat-
