Reporter to Talk at Davidson

David Burnham, prize-win-
ning former New York Times Re-
porter, will talk about “Fact and
Fiction in the Major Media: NY

During his-15- years atthe
Times, Burnham wrote a major
series of stories on the New York
Police Department known as the
“Serpico” stories, upon which the
Al Pacino movie “Serpico” was
based. In the late 1970s, while
covering nuclear safety and prolif-
eration problems, Burnham was in
contact with Karen Silkwood and
was the reporter Silkwood was
going to deliver papers to the night
she died.

Bumham is the author of two
acclaimed investigative books, The
Rise of the Computer State, about
the impact of communications
technology on privacy and free-
dom in the U.S., and Law Unto
Itself: Power, Politics, and the
IRS, an investigative study of the
Internal Revenue Service. He is
currently at work on a book about
the U.S. Justice Department.

Bumham has worked as a re-
porter at CBS News, Newsweek,
and United Press International, and
has won awards including the Page
One Award for Community Ser-
vice, and Best Investigative Book
of 1990.

Bumham and Joanne Omang,
aformer foreigncorrespondent and
editorat The Washington Post, will
also be attending Professor Liz
Benedict’s non-fiction writing
class on Wednesday afternoon.

Bumham’s lecture will take
place at 7:30 pm in the 900 Room
of the College Union Building.
Please call 892-2272 for more in-
formation.

help!!

This year the Office of Ad-
mission and Davidson Ambassa-
dors have worked together to im-
prove the tour guide program.
Before this year, all you had.to do
to be atour guide was to sign up for
it. But this year, eachcandidate for
a tour guide position had to fill out
an application and go through an
interview. With this new system,
we chose 43 tour guides. We have
had great success with the new
program. As one senior from Sa-
lem High School said, ““My tour
guide was great-a very amiable
and exciting person. Too bad the
tour had to end.”

If you are interested in be-
coming a tour guide, be on the look
out for more information. We will
have applications available after
Thanksgiving, and interviews will

‘be held after Christmas. This will

be a year commitment (except for
those who want to go abroad next
Fall). FRESHMEN, you can now
be tour Guides too. If you have any
questions , please call Will 892-

4705, Sally 6374, or Lisa 2186.
1993 Senior Class Gift —

Kiss Your Mater Bye-bye

How would you like to have
our class remembered? On De-
cember 2nd and 3rd the entire se-
nior class will vote to decide what
gift we will give back to our school.

The Senior Class Gift is a tra-
dition first instituted by the Class
of 1983, which makes this upcom-
ing year its tenth anniversary. The
purpose of the gift is not only to
leave a lasting impression on the
school, a token of remembrance,
but also to benefit the Davidson of
the future.

Previous gifts have included
scholarships for students of inter-
‘national studies, outstanding mi-
nority students, summer abroad
programs, or for freshman with
outstanding leadership skills or
service record. Other classes have
given a computer fund, a campus

fund (Class of 1990, after Hurri-
cane Hugo), and a Love of Learn-
ing Fund. The Class of 1992 gave
a Student Emergency Loan Fund
which provides short-term: inter-
est-free loans to students in finan-
cial crisis.

The process for deciding a gift
begins with gift suggestions. A
couple of things to keep in mind
might be the timeliness of the gift
(i.e. the new Arts Center will be
here soon, etc.) and the popularity
of the gift, whether the gift should
be an endowment gift or a fund.

There are envelopes for gift

riefs

ideas in Chambers, Little Library,
and the Union, or you can contact
one of the committee members.
Amy Branch and Andrew
Bazemore are this year’s
chairpeople; Stephanie Glaser of
the Development Office will assist
the committee.

Branch and Bazemore asked
15 individuals to join the commit-
tee in hopes of creating a diverse
group representative of the class.
The committee will take care of
publicity and organization, as well
as choose which 5 gifts will be
selected for the class vote.

Voting takes place on Decem-
ber 2nd and 3rd. The committee
then selects about 50 to 60 people
who will be responsible for solicit-
ing money. :

The goal is to collect $50,000
by the fifth year after graduation.
The way an endowment gift works
is through the interestaccumulated.
The gift can therefore have a last-
ingsignificance, and be reused year
after year. A funded gift is one in
which the money donated is the
money used. This type is often a
