’ opening of the Baker Sports
Complex nears, Grover
Meetze, Director of Facilities
Planning, seems confident
that construction will be com-
pleted “close to that date.”
Although there will “be some
time moving in that we’ ll have
to be flexible with,” he added,
all new facilities will be ready
soon after students arrive next
fall.

Assistant Athletic Director
Bob Price remains optimistic
that the basketball arena will
be open for use by the start of
the 1989-90 basketball sea-
son. Price says the construc-
tion is progressing nicely,
though he would not guaran-
tee that the arena will be ready
do to the possibility of an
accident that could set back
the completion date or the
chance of bad weather be-

“tween now and next fall.

Price said that the comple-
tion date is in time for the first
game of next season and not
the first day of school in Au-
gust. However, there are some
ceremonies planned in Octo-
ber, so it would be nice for the
complex to completed by
then,

It is also possible that the
basketball arena could be used

completed. Price said that for
example the. basketball court
could be used while the finish-
ing touches are still being
done onthe pool.

The gym itself will have
1400 permanent seats and
another 4200 temporary seats
that could be rolled out for the
big games. Price anticipates
all home games except for the
UNCC game to be played in
the new arena. He is hopeful
that the big name opponents
such as Duke and Wake Forest
will play Davidson on the new
court. ®

Price said that it is not eco-
nomical to continue to play
games in the new Charlotte
Coliseum because Davidson
must pay for all the conces-

- sion stands and everything
just like it was a Hornets
game, even though Davidson
attracts far less than the
23,000 fans that the Hornets
average.

In addition to the basketball
arena, the complex has facili-

' ties for all the other indoor
sports. There is a volleyball
court which is next to the bas-
ketball arena. There is also a
wrestling room that will be the
most modem in the area. The
weight room has a nautilus
side and a free weight side. In
between the two sides is an

blockhead is movable so that
the swimming and diving ar-

~

eas can be separated, and ‘

there is a computer operated
machine that will control the

As for the swimming pro-"

gram, Price, after consulting
with other schools, has de-
cided to make hiring an Aq-
uatics Director his first prior-
ity, and then a coach will be
hired to start a varsity swim
program.

The locker rooms are small
but numerous. This way each
sport can have their own pri-
vate locker room and does not
have to share with another
sport.

There are also facilities for
the non-varsity athlete since
eight racquetball courts and

- one squash court are being

built.

Each coach will have his or

her own office which will be a
vast improvement over the
current situation in Johnston
Gym.

Scienti: t to speak on possibilities

of genetic manipulation

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

Futuristic thrillers - employ
human genetic manipulation as
standard plot material. Yet Clem-
ent Markert, Davidson College’s
1989 Wearn Science Lecturer,
slowly brings this manipulation
closer to our time. In his research
involving mice and pigs, Markert
provides the basis for experi-
ments on humans.

On February 21 at Davidson
College’s Love Auditorium,
Markert plans to discuss the social
implications of genetic manipula-
tion. His lecture, entitled “Ma-
nipulating the Genetic Basis of
Life: Are We Ready?” explores
the moral and scientific repercus-
sions stemming from his current
research.

Markert. is distinguished re-
search professor of animal sci-

-ence. and genetics at North Caro-

lina State University.

“Human genetic manipulation
obviously can’t be very far
away,” begins Markert. “The
question is, what will we decide to
do?”

Markert’s current experiments
on pigs lay the groundwork for
human genetic manipulation.
Within the next five years. he
hopes to combine the desirable
characteristics of American and
Chinese animals to create a “per-

fect pig.” The procedure involves
surgically introducing new genes
into the chromosomes, thus alter-
ing the organism’s genetic devel-
opment.

For some, Markert’s potential
success with animals poses sig-
nificant moral problems. During
the course of his speech Markert
plans to logically refute many of
these arguments.

“We change the world about us
every day,” Markert states.
“What I would like to do with the
pigs isn’t anything compared to
what has been done throughout
centuries of genetic selection.”

Markert maintains that genetic
manipulation already stands as a
possibility with human beings.
Procedures such as_ breeding
humans are already scientifically
problable. Future developments
include acure for diseases caused
by a genetic deficiency, such as
hemophilia.

However, these experiments
create obvious moral conflicts.
Markert forsees a time when the
cures would become common
place and the lack of a sharp line
between disease and health would
cause problems. People might use
genetic manipulation to change
behavior for social reasons.

“To change the genetic makeup
is to change the person,” says

Markert. Before human genetic
manipulations are initiated he
believes that society must estab-
lish a firm goal for that change.

Despite advancements in the
genetics field, technical problems
still baffle geneticists. In creating
a “super swine,” Markert con-
fronts a crucial issue: “We can
alter the general nature of an or-
ganisms, but not in any controlled
way.” Without a procedure to
identify the element that alters a
specific trait, genetic manipula-
tion remains a shot in the dark.

Traditionally, scientists carried
out all genetic experiments by
manipulating the eggs and sperm.
Yet Markert’s research extends
beyond these means to conduct
experiments at the cellular level.

“We are learning to bypass the
genetic barriers that keep the spe-
cies separate,” says Donald Kim-
mel, professor of biology at
Davidson. “We are learning with
pigs so we can do the same in
humans.”

The benefical results of human
genetic manipulation could be
enormous, asserts Markert. The
possibility exists for scientists to
cure hereditary diseases in addi-
tion to correcting the chemical
imbalances in the brain which
cause insanity.’ These procedures
are, however, still a long way off.

Davidson sets the standards

Ross chosen to design national economic achievement test

By LISA GERRARD
When comprehensive. exams roll around next
spring Davidson. economics majors might have an
edge over those at other colleges and universities.
After all, the man who wrote the nation’s standard-

ized achievement test is
Davidson economics professor
Clark Ross.

The new economics test is one
of 15 produced by the Educa-
tional Testing Service (ETS)--
the designers of the SAT and
GRE as well. ETS published the
tests last year in response to the
need for a reliable measure of
comparison among schools. The"
new exams, called Major Field
Achievement Tests (MFAT), are
giving both professors and stu-
dents a better overview of their
national standing.

Although most MFATs cap-
tured rave reviews by the 223
institutions that participated in
pilot administrations, the first
economics test and five others
proved too difficult and were
revised this year.

Ross wrote to ETS last year and suggested: that
they employ a broader range of questions to accom-
modate students with a more rounded background.
Having received additional complaints already, ETS
jumped at the chance to involve an interested under-
graduate professor the MFAT project.

During :a three-month procedure Ross collabo-
rated with professor Hans Palmer of Pomona College
in Clairmont, Ca., to write the second test. The two
put finishing touches on their 104 questions during a -
day in Princeton, N.J.,at ETS offices. =

Ross said previous major assessment tests have
been inappropriate for students at liberal arts institu-
tions. He was glad to have been chosen for the job
because it gave him the opportunity to make up for
years of what he has considered.technically biased

testing. The new test will be ef-
fective, he said, because it cor-
rectly reflects or accommodates
the curriculum of most schools’
economics programs.

While colleges and uni-
versities around the country vie
for top positions and top stu-
dents, assessing the quality of
academic achievement = and
comparing schools nationwide
have become increasingly im-
portant issues for educators,
according to Nancy Beck of
ETS.

As in the past, Davidson
is testing economics majors with
the GRE alone this year. “The
problem with the GRE is that it
concentrates too much on spe-
cialized areas that students do
not typically take as undergradu-

ates,” Ross said. “It is better for assessing the poten-

exam.”

tial of a student in graduate school rather than
competency in the major. We will use the new
MFAT as a part of our seniors’ comprehensive

Most Davidson economics majors consider
Ross’s examinations “extremely fair.” Senior Lisa
Stewart has taken three courses with Ross and says
his tests are average in comparison with those by
other economics professors. “His tests do require a
good deal of understanding and interpretation of the
material, though,” she said.
