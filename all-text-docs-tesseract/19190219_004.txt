ATTENTION! ALUMNI!

It is yet four months till Commence-
ment, which will be held May 25-28 in-
clusive. But even now the. college is
looking forward toward Commencement
and hopes among other expectations that
this May will mark a Grand Reunion
of Alumni. The Great War is just over
and the part played in it by Davidson
alumni and present students gives every
alumnus a right to feel proud that the
old college sent 800 men under the col-
ors. Those who went overseas will re-
turn with long stories and tales of their
adventures in. France. “Those who were
so unfortunate as to have to remain for
one cause or another on this side, will
wish to greet their more fortunate class-
mites and comrades and hear their won-
derful experiences,

The college looks forward to the
proud greeting of all these sons who have
sustained her name in one more struggle
of our country. There have been a
number of changes on the campus in re-
cent years. Your Alma Mater wishes
her alumni to revisit her and view these
changes and the progress made. She
wishes your support and plans for a
Greater Davidson in the future.

This Commencement will mark a re-
union of the classes of 1914, 1909, 1904,
1899, 1894, 1879..and 1874. It is hoped
that the presidents and members of these
various classes will get into active com-
