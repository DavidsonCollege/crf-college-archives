What do you see?

What do you imply?

A movement, an intonation of
The voice — does it mean
anything?

What do you want to say —

I refer to something not realizing

He uses a phrase
oh well
What’s the point .

The Killing Joke

When I close my eyes
I think of you

When I open them

I think of someone else
Love is funny that way.

The heart is a dangerous weapon

It plays too many games.

Sometimes I wonder if I love you
Other times I forget to ask.
Love is funny

That way you keep me awake at night —
I love therefore I am.
I think I love too much, |
I think I love you too much.
My heart is a dangerous enemy,
Love is funny that way.

The Carnival. _

I am caught

in a pinwheel

spinning
backwards

in the breeze.

And I land

amidst the carnival

with my friends
-who are children.

We skip and‘laugh
eating cotton candy
which melts

on our teeth

into cavities,

we scream

as the roller coaster
whips around

too fast,
it won’t stop —

Until we enter

the funhouse
which we love,

but the mirrors
make us tall —

we are grown .
and we are trapped

forever
in this house.

this pinwheel
spins violently

forward
and is lost

Concatination to the Big Sea of Thought “
Will went fishing in the big sea of thought: Bernard Hart
And showed his grandma what he’d caught

She cried out — “Get rid of that thing,

Will you, Will? It stinks!”

Please.

The editors can’t continue in this vegetative state.

Too many nights at the layout board.
