swipe of the Wildcat’s paw and—
goodbye Spiderweb. This is our
first encounter with clan from up on
the Muddy James River and no
doubt the Spiders have a neat web
woven for us.

Citadel.

The Cadets drew another goose-
egg. V.M. I. opened up and bow-
led them over by a 30 to O count.
The lads from Citadel must have put
up a good fight though, because V.
M. 1. has) one everlasting War
Horse of a team this year.

U. of S.C.

Coach Metzger’s pig-skin chasers
lost to the Tar Heels
touchdown. The Palmetto State
lads had hard luck, twice coming
within the 10 yard line only to lose
the ball on downs. ‘They put up a
plucky fight and were especially
strong on the defense.

U. of N. C.

The Tar Babies failed to develop
drive enough to put across over one
tally against South Carolina. Hlan-
by saved the day by grabbing up a
blocked punt and running 30 yards
for a touchdown. The Rah-Rah
lads got away to a flying start, car-
rying the ball down to the 15 yard
line, but here they failed to produce
drive enough to carry-on.

Furman.

Coach Laval’s boys are still put-
ting up the same gilt edge perfor-
mance they began the year with.
The best the University of Georgia
could do was to score a lone touch-
down. Only 7 first downs were
made, four by Furman and three by
Georgia. The play was in the cen-
ter of the field until the last few
minutes. Two deceptive passes en-
abled the Crackers to cross the cov-
eted chalk line.

N. C. State sacrificed the good
name she made by her defeat of
Navy, by not presenting her strong-
est line-up against Penn State last
week. Coach Fetzer’s lads took a
41 to 0 drubbing, but saved Johnson,
Parks, and Faucette from possible
injuries, so that they would be in
prime shape to seek revenge on
University of N. C., this week. Not
a single first down was made by N.
C. State.

Trinity.

Followers of the gridiron game in
Carolina and the South, are inter-
ested and pleased to see the en-
trance of Trinity College into foot-
ball circles again. The Methodists
have been out of the game for 26
years and inaugurated their re-en-
trance by a 20 to 6 victory over
Guilford. Among the spectators,
were three of the 1891 Trinity
eleven which carried off the cham-
pionship honors of the South. Here’s
wishing them luck.

CLASS BASBETBALL TO
BEGIN IN NOVEMBER

The annual class basketball series
promises to be a very hard fought
and peppy contest this year. These
games will probably be played the
last three weeks of November in
anticipation of Varsity practice,
which begins the first of December.
Several men are already

ful series of class games.

SCRUBS TO PLAY N. C.
STATE FRESHMEN.

Other Games in Prospect for Coach
Grey’s Second Strong Men.

“After long and untiring efforts,”
as they say, the assistant managers
of football have arranged a game
for the scrubs with the N. S. State
freshmen, to be played at the Sand
Hill Fair, November 18. This is to
be one of the big events of the sea-
son at this resort and should be a
great trip for the scrubs.

Negotiations are under way with
other colleges of the Carolinas and
the assistant managers say that the
serubs will very probably enjoy one
or two more trips. Arrangements
are also being made for a good}
geme on the “Hill.”

The scrubs have done and are do-
ing good work and have earned ev-
erything that is coming to them.
They are looking to the student
body for the same support the Var-
sity is getting, for they have made
the Varsity possible. Go to it,
Scrubs!

THE DAVIDSON SPECIAL.

The old saying you can’t keep a
good man down was certainly
put into realization Saturday. Four
hundred and seventy-five of the stu-
dent body boarded the Winston-
Salem southbound, alias, the David-
son-Charlotte “catch as you can"
railroad with great expectation.
Ked and Black was around with
bells on and that old Davidson spirit
commonly known as pep was cer-
tainly displayed. Rushing for the
extra coaches like Belgian Refugees

capacity and then some more. Pull-
ing out of the station like No. 38 go-

‘ing North frequent shrieks of fire.

water and smoke ‘coupled with
numerous yells certainly showed the

tural populace and travelers along
the road that Davidson was out to
do damage or else bust. Arriving in
;Charlotte ten minutes behind sched-

ule time only tended to arouse pep

‘and it certainly proved its worth.

Everybody piled out and beat it up
town to get a strip of red and black
ribbon.

On the return trip the “Pullgians”

ticing some, in hopes of represent-; were opened for occupation at ten-

ing their respective classes in these
games.

The pep of the Senior class will
probably be upheld by A. F. Fricker,
W. C. Hodgin, A. D. King, A. P.
Ormond, M, B. Heiser and some
other dark horses, who have not
taken an active part in this game
before. The Senior class is handi-
capped by a number of its men
playing Varsity football at the same
time, as well as by the loss of some
of last vear’s players who failed to
return this fall. With the memory
of last vear’s victory the Juniors
represented by M. R. Doubles, L. L.
Erwin, M. M. Erwin, A. C. Ormond
and J. P. Price, should put up an-
other hard fight for new glories.

The bloody Sophs will also be out
for blood and promise to put up a
good fight with a team which will
probably be selected from G. N.
Adams, R. C. Brake, C. R. Crawford,
J. E. Hunter, G. W. Manze, G. B.
Sorrels, C. M. Striebeck, F. K. Tor-
rey and C. D. Tuller.

Rumors are that the Fresh class
has an unusual amount of basket-

forty p.m. and were no sooner
opened than occupied. At eleven
uclock, they cleared the dock and
with fifteen rahs for the Queen City
bade farewell to Charlotte and its
populace, Although tired and worn-
out the old spirit that always goes
wherever Davidson does still pre-
ivailed. Conversation took the form
of Keith’s Vaudeville. the football
‘game, and the dance. This soon
-wore off though and gave way to
sleep in all its form; which was only
broken up by the big bass voice of
‘the brakeman, announcing the ap-
proach to Davidson. Everybody
_vacated the Special in short-order
and hurried to their respective
jrooms to resume their dreams of
Davidson’s stellar football team and
“what makes them so wild.”

The Civic Club and Parent-Teach-
er Association gave a_ reception
Tuesday evening at the Club Hall
in honor of the teachers of the grad-
ed school. The officers of the club,
teachers and school board formed
the receiving line.
