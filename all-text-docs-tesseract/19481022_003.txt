early and never quit hitting.

The same day the gold-shirted KAs- bounced back to pin
a 30-0 spanking on the undermanned Sigma Chi club. The
Knights hit on the first play from scrimmage as Bill Bird
flipped to end Charlie Mitchell who raced forty yards down
the sidelines behind beautiful blocking -by Hal Haynes to
score. 7

Minutes later Paul Richardson crashed through to bloek a
punt by Harry Brown and Bill Adams pounced on it in the
end zone for tally number two.

The third score came midway in the second half, Tim
Hardin raced from out of nowhere to nail an errant Sigma
Chi aerial in midfield and sped down field to score. Bird added
the fourth marker on a five-vard trip ayound left end.

With seconds left, blocking back Richardson intercepted
another toss on his own twenty and advanced to the one
where he was chased out of bounds. On the next play Bird
hit end Harry Bachman in the end: zone among a host of
enemy backs as the game ended.
