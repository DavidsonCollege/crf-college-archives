Support the Bone Marrow
Registry

On Wednesday from 9AM until 4PM, the
Project Life Committee of Davidson will
sponsor their third Bone Marrow Drive in the
Morrison Room of the Union. Spurred by the

experiences of several Davidson students, the
group was established in order to recruit poten-
tial bone marrow donors. In their three years of
existence, the group has successfully registered
almost 800 Davidson students, faculty and staff
in the National Bone Marrow Registry, as well as

raising over $80,000. (It costs approximately

$60.00 to test and type each blood sample.)

In a relatively painless procedure, two table-
spoons of blood are drawn from an individual.
From this sample, it is possible to link an indi-
vidual with someone in need of a bone marrow
transplant, which can cure such blood disorders
as leukemia. As Davidson senior David Lind-
say, a recipient of such a transplant, says, where
else can you find "an easier method of searching
and testing for potential miracles"

So on Wednesday, in this season of papers,
tests and stress, take a few minutes out of your

_ schedule to give someone another chance. It is
such an easy process and the Project Life Com-
mittee needs your support. It can mean a lot: it
can mean a life. . . just ask David.

To the Editor:

I realize, maybe all too
well, that the better parts of
our nature as human beings
truly wantto be sympathetic,
in touch, concerned, even
active with the day to day
trials of human suffering.

- | People suffer, there is pain.

Somehow wehaveacknowl-
edged this fact, come toterms
with its monstrosity in our
consciences, and have
merely.,.moved on.

Yet I understand the
limits upon an individual and
what one person thinks he or
she can do. We have our
work, our friends, our fu-
tures—we thrive ina micro-
cosm of a life that we will be
filling in its true breath be-
fore we know it. But that
does not justify not giving
time and energy to human

need.

I feel we are a privi-
leged few. Have you ever
taken a few steps past our
delicately structured post
office to see the homes be-
yond? On both a literal and
idiomatic level, there is a
part of Davidson which lies
.on the other side of the tracks.
Even in this little town, the
socioeconomic divisions are
sO easy to observe. Seeing
this on such a small scale,
you’d think we would have
more active voices and hands
in things with a booming
city just minutes away.

Volunteer. Give time.
Give attention. Give love.
Promote peace within the
person and between eah
other. Please, let this be a
messageto those whodo not
take part, or who are unsure

pout Sevice

of lending a hand to the local
and worldwide struggle to
develop human services that
is going on right now. From
one person to another, I am

_ deeply grateful that many,

many individuals on this
campus do volunteer, and
are concerned with one need
or another. For though this
letter does not have a thrust
for a specific effort, there is
always a great need for help,
for aid.

Find something that is
calling you. For others who
are out there, in this desper-

_ate, often tumultuous world,

our secure lives look very
good from the outside. Give
to others some of what you
have—security of mind and
security in life.

Now that the campaign
is over, Bush and Clinton
will stop yelling ateach other
and politics will return to
where it belongs: in this col-
umn, and on the back of cars.
Some keep their politics to
themselves, some wear it on
their sleeves, but the great
political debate will always
rage when it comes to
bumper stickers. Sure
they’re tacky. Who wants a
hot pink “Arms are for Hug-
ging!” bumpersticker on the
back of their racing green
Mercedes? If I had a
Mercedes or even a Yugo, I
wouldnever have something
like that on it. I’d put ona
better bumper sticker! .

Most bumper stickers
are liberal. From the run-of-
the-mill “Clinton-Gore”
stickers you see in satellite
(all of the “Bush-Quayle”
drivers have enough initia-
tive to get a good spot) to
“Get that Warmonger out of
the White House!” which is
seen on my street in Philly,

| liberals are quick to make

their cars slogan-mobiles.
I’ve seen really stupid ones
like “Low Income Homes
not Atom Bombs,” and also
clever lines like “Pot is an
Herb, Bush is a Dope.” Oh
yes, the sixties are not over;
I saw an “I Am Woman,
Hear Me Roar” sticker,

"My Kid Beat Up
Your Honor Stu-
dent"

which prompted me to ask if
“roaring” means taking up
two parking spaces with a
Geo in a shopping mall.
Despite the abundance
of left wing bumper stick-
ers, theright wing have some
good ones to. (No, I don’t
mean God Is My Copilot.)
I’ve seen “This Car Insured
by Smith and Wesson”,
“Slash and Burn the
Rainforest,” “Pave the Bay,”
and my favorite, “I Love
Animals, They’re Deli-

Gull's Nest...Bill Gullan
Bumperstickers Galore or
What I Saw on The Back of a Car

cious,”

Not all of the stickers
we see are political. Older
people have been known to
place “King of the Road,” or
“Look Out, I’m Senile” on
theircars. Actually, [haven’t
ever seen the second one,
but don’t some of these
people really need it. Par-
ents have a “Baby on Board”
signs, which are useful so
we know not to hit them.
Othermessagesare spin-offs
of thesesincere stickers, such
as “Baby in Trunk.”

. Some people say that
their kid is and honor stu-
dentat suchand such school.
I’ve always wanted to see
“My Kid Just Narrowly
Missed the Honor Role,” or
“My Kid is Stupid,” which
I’ll probably see on my
father’s Taurus at Thanks-
giving. Oh, how about this
one, “My Kid Beat Up Your
Honor Student.”

Some folks say where
they’ve been. Isawa “PhilJa-
