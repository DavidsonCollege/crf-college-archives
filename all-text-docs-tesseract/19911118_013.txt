No Internships For Credit?
Rumors Abound And A Non- Story Unfolds

By David Smyth

Many students over the past
week have been shocked to learn
that academic credit will no longer
be granted for internships done in
Charlotte or elsewhere during the
school year. “But what will I do?”
they’ve wailed. “I'll never be able
todo my job at the Observer ‘cause
they changed the #$%@! rules!”

It has come as no surprise to
Registrar Sue Ross, however, as
Davidson College has never given

academic credit for internships of
any description. The recent uproar
over the purported change in pol-
icy has been another typical
Davidson rumor inflated to seem
important to a worrisome studen-
uy.

During research for this late-
breaking “news,” though, Ross
said anumber of things aboutleam-
ing in general, and how Davidsoni-
ans benefit from traditional acade-
mia and real-world experience.

“T don’t know where this rumor
started. We’ve never given credit
for internships. The faculty has
been clear. You don’t get an aca-
demic course credit every time you
learn something.” For Ross, the
distinction lies in the difference
between in-class and out-of-class
learning.

The transcript reflects in-class
achievement, and thatis essentially’
all. Students can often work in an
internship within the parameters

Oxfam Fast For World Hunger
To Be Held At Davidson This Thursday

By Jackie Carberry
& Mary Russ
Every day, 60,000 people die
of hunger and related diseases.
Forty thousand of those casualties
are children under five. If you’re
not shocked, perhaps you should
be. :

deadlines and committments.
Rarely do we take time out of our
frenzied schedules to consider the

Facing crises like global pov-
erty can be overwhelming, but we
have no excuse to turn our backs
onsuch apressing and very real di-
lemma. It is within our power to
makea difference through a simple
act called fasting.

Fasting is a noble tradition
which has existed since before

The first bungee jumps were

lians and New Zealanders. But
leave it to adventuresome Ameri-
cans to refine the sport.

While leaping from bridges
gave Americans a thrill, authori-
tieseventually deemed the bridge
sites illegal, That’s when a hotair
balloonist’in California got the
idea to offer the same excitement
from an anchored balloon hover-
ing above ground.

The bungee jumper begins his
adventure by riding with the bal-
loon pilot 150 feet up into the air.
The jumperis secured in a special
harness that is attached to the
heavy duty elastic cords that are
fastened to the balloon. Once the
pilot gives the signal, the jumper
moves onto a small platform at-
tached to the balloon and takes
offinto the wild blue yonder. The
cord, which acts like a huge rub-
ber band, allows the jumper to
free fall several feet and to bounce
back up when the cord reaches its
stretching capacity. The ride back
up is as much of arush as the free

made from bridges by Austra-

‘instruction.

“Jumping from a hot air bal-

ture for adults ofall ages” said Dan
Stone, owner of Balloons Over
Charlotte. “We've taken away the
danger of bumping into a bridge
and putin the thrill of free falling in
a wide open space. We use a seat
and chest hamess which helps
distribute the mild force over a
wide area of the jumper’s body.
This is one sporting adventure that
people will be talking about for a
long time,” said, Stone. “Our
bungee jumpers will never forget
the thrill and excitement we gave
them.”

The real causes of world hunger
usually stem from policies and
forces over which the poor have no
control.

Deprived of ‘ail and decent
wages, the poor are often forced
into a state of hunger. They work
hard, but the fruit of their labor is
taken from them.

Twonights ago at 8:30pm,
I was driving back from Cash-
ions,andI counted nine female
runners....all running alone.

As humans, we women
should have the right to walk
alone, to feel safe as we enter
our homes late at night, to not
have tocall forthe Escort serv-
ice, to be able to drink without
running the risk of “asking for
it’, to run alone at night, but
reality is not this way.

Reality is that women are
often attacked in extremely
violent ‘ways. Davidson is not
immune to this type of vio-
lence. :

The following is an article
written by Sandra Smith ‘91
that any woman should read
before she decides to don a
pair of running shoes....alone:

On March 29, 1989 I used
poor judgement and went run-
ning after dark, alone. As I

his grip, he told me to shut up
or he would kill me. Just as my
walkman headphone cord was
tangling around us both, I saw

The Rides Board is finally
here! The bulletin board hangs
to the left of the Wilson Room,
downstairs in the Union and is
covered by a huge map of the
US. Any Davidson student who
needs aride or needs passengers
can post -their information on
slips of paper on the board.

There will be two different
colors of paper--one for rides
offered, the other for rides
needed. Each slip had space for
the person’s name and phone
number, destination, dates,
times, and any additional infor-
mation (ie: “I will pay 1/2 gas
costs’).

Texas andalmostevery state
east of the Mississippi has’ its
own cup hook on which to hang
the slips. Students are respon-
sible for getting in touch with

-| people offering orneeding rides

and for screening their own rid-
ers.and drivers.

Quickly I realized that it was
the headlights of an Oldsmobile,

_ driven by a bearded Good Samari-

tan blowing his horn to scare the
attacker away. So he did, and I
jumped into the car, still scream-

If I ever forget particular facts
aboutthis experience, I will never,
never forget the sound of my own
vice screaming from lungs with
immeasurable depths and an inex-
haustible capacity for noise.

I am telling you about this
incident, two years after the fact,
for several reasons, none of which
are to receive attention, or God
forbid, any sympathy. I do so be-
cause people on this campus need
to be awakened not only to the
injustices of this society, and to be
aware thatrape, sexual harassment
and abuse take place, but we need
take responsibility for our own
actions and attitudes. _ ~

Two fundamental feelings
arose from my attack. The first was

and my sisters. I had a fear of

behind me, of large trees behind.
