OCTOBER 24, 1969

Et Tu, Agnew?

“Baltimore has praduced more los-
ers in the past year than any other
American city: the Colts, the Orioles
and the Agnew.”

-from the Raleigh News
and Observer—

Unless you are accustomed to watch-
ing the evening news, you probably
missed Vice President Agnew’s—ad-
dress Sunday concerning the Vietnam
Moratorium.

The story made the papers Monday
morning, but in most.cases it was
buried rather deep in the national
news section where only-editors read.
The speech, as usual, was the Agnew
angle, but in this case it bears some
attention.

In his address before New Orleans
Republicans, Agnew seemed to be is
suing his ‘From The Bench” report,
though missing a great deal of the
significant action. And he lacked
Crosswhite’s subtlety, too.

In remarking on the Moratorium,
he went to the defense of the Nixon
war policy, not by reinforcing its good
points, but by lashing out at the organ-
izers of the nationwide protest as ‘‘an
effete corps of impudent snobs who
characterize themselves as intellect-
uals.”

He stated his opinion that the Mora-
torium was brought on by a prevailing
“spirit of natiogal masochism.!}’

Not satisfied with the evaluation,
he generalized on the youth of the
nation saying that “subtlety is lost
and fine distinctions based on acute
reasoning are carelessly ignored in a
headlong jump to a predetermined
conclusion.”

The Nixon Administration spent

most of Monday bracing for the wave
of protest to accompany this  state-
ment and issuing their own statement
to contradict the wayward vice presi-
dent.

But it is this.“‘acute reasoning” of
the vice president which is defeating
the administration’s efforts to effect

»some sort, of credibility in the nation-

al~poputation regarding its honest
efforts to end the war

Agnew’ said that the nationwide
protest was “a reflection of the con
fusion that exists in America today,”
but neglected to realize that the con
fusion has grown out of a disillusion-
ment nroduced by the administra
tion’s “Closed Ear’ policy.

In his statement that “the lessons
of the past are ignored-and obliterat-
ed=in a contemporary - antagonism
known as the generation gap,’ he
fails to rote that a number of Ameri-
cans are looking to the past with dis
appointment and losing hope that the
present situation will produce peace
in the future.

“If the Moratorium had any use
whatever,” he said, “it served as an
emotional purgation of those who feel
the need to cleanse themselves of their
lack of ability to offer a constructive
solution to the problem.”

Such an attitude, without regard
for the increasing sympathy with those
in protest, is strangely similar to that
of the mother, who when watching
her son’s high schéol band march by
in the parade, commented that her son
was the only one in step.

A large part of America is still

waiting for the openness which the

Nixon camp promised during the
campaign of 1968.

Tomorrow's football clash at The

Citadel ‘shapes up as more than just -

the game that may decid@ the, South-
ern Conference football cltampionship
— if that’s not enough in itself.

We refer to the references made
to. Davidson in a long column in
Charleston’s ‘“‘News and Courier’ last
August. In his discussion of David:
son football the executive sports
editor of that newspaper speculated
on his projected decline of football
at Davidson — which is certainly his
prerogative. ‘

What we object to is his. indictment
of the student body. In an offhand
analysis of Davidson’s student make-
up he speculated that Davidson had
been taken over by those same “‘soft-
bellied types’ that had subverted all
wholesome pursuits on other cam-
puses in the country, rejecting all self
discipline, hard work, etc.

What he failed to note was that
all except two teams.at Davidson .com-
pete without athletic scholarships,
that the intramural program at David-
son involves a large percentage of
the student body, and that at least
one intercollegiate team competes
without a coach and buys its own
uniforms.

Meanwhile, the sports editor’s own
favorites at The Citadel field subsi-

And if our figures are correct, when
the two teams take the field at The
Citadel’s Johnson Hagood Memorial
Stadium tomorrow, the Wildcats will
face a team with double its number
of football scholarships. It- looks to
us as if Davidson’s program doesn’t
reflect the totally professional aspect
that The Citadel’s program does.

And while we're instructing our
Charleston colleague in what to look
for if he’s going to write about sports,
we ask him to consider some of the old
high school slogans about sportsman-
ship in regard to his own darlings at
The Citadel.

In an interview reported in Charles-
ton’s Tuesday morning paper, Citadel
head coach Jimmy “Red” Parker com
mented that this year’s edition of
Wildcat football was much tougher
than in past seasons. But the former
Fordyce (Arkansas) High School coach
added, “I don’t know how realty tough
they would be if it got nasty out there,
like a near fist-fight on every play.
We'll find out Saturday because that’s
the way we plan to play them.”

_We'’re not advocating that the Da-
vidson players take such a view of
the game, but we are advocating that
for the good name of sports it is im-

rative “that The Citadel’s Bulldogs

Cary Charges That ROTC

Is Intimidating Protesters

To the Editor:

An incident concerning the
Vietnam War Moratorium
has come to my attention
which I feel should be pre-
sented to th college com-
munity at large as a matter
of vital importance.

I am given to understand
from reliable sources that
during the Moratorium some
of the ROTC cadre took the
names of Advanced ROTC
cadets who participated in
the Moratorium, ‘and that
later some of these cadets
were called before high
authorities ip the ROTC de-

partment ‘advised not to
participate in such events
again.

Quite frankly, this makes
me want to vomit. © This
seems to be a blatant dis-

regard of the right of free!

‘speech and expression—en-

Shrined in American tradi-
tion, and which the United
States Army is supposedly
obligated to protect.

We are living in a college
community, where discus-
sion of varying views and
presentation of different
viewpoints, no matter how
unpopular, is part of the pur-
suit of truth to which we are
suposedly dedicated, and a
restriction on the right of
free speech is obviously a
violation of the spirit of free
inquiry.

Members of ROTC are also
human beings, concerned
with the welfare ‘of others,
and in doing this realize
that it is necessary to un-
derstand what is going on
in the world, and view-
points other than their own.

They may even disagree
with American policy in

Vietnam—but is this treach-
ery? I think not.

Do they have the right to
do this, even if they belong
to ROTC? Yes, I think so.

Disagreement with Ameri-
can foreign policy dogs not
mean that one is trying to
destroy the United States—
on the contrary, one may
feel that he is attempting to
Save it.

Personally, I tend to’ dis-
agree with the approach to
Vietnam generally present-
ed at the Moratorium, (for
rather complex reas ons
which are not rehevant
here), but I am sympathetic
to some extent, and no mat-
ter how violently I disagree
I will always defend their
right to their own opinion.

People have a right to their

expression, and a right to
express it whether they be

c partment

civilians or ROTC cadets.

If the ROTC department
continues along the lines of
a secret police, I believe that
rather soon there.will be no
ROTC department on the
Davidson campus — because
the students, faculty and ad-
ministration here are not go-
ing to stand for such dis-
gusting action. .

The ROTC department
should consider care-
fully their courses of action.
In certain respects: it is an
asset to the college com-
munity, and it would be
rather unfortunate if the de-
were forced off
campus (though under the
circumstances certainly un-
derstandable).

My purpose” is to ad-
monish, not to destroy.

Report

To the Editor:

As the latest stage-in my
personal campaign to be ac-
curately represented in your
news columns, I wish to state
categorically that the, second
item numbered (2) ‘‘whether
the South Vietnamese gov-
ernment is a desirable alter-
native to the Viet Cong’’ is
in no way representative of
any criterion I discussed at
the Moratorium and I re-
gard the implication that I
used this test to condemn
the war as personally
damaging.

If your reporter will check
with others present, will
look at the original text I
read which 1 still have, or
consult the slightly revised
version which may be re-
produced, he will see the in-
accuracy of his summary of
this point. es

I did, in fact, in my third
criterion ask ‘‘Does the war
defend an established or
morally preferable order
from actual or threatened
destruction? Does the mili-
tary intervention further
contructive political and
social purposes? Or more
simply, do the acts of war
emerge from right intent?’*

I did not mention the Viet
Cong in my answer and while
I did condemn all of the suc-
cessive South Vietnam gov-
ernments as not being esta-
blished or morally preferable
orders, I did not specifically
raise the question of ‘how
some morally preferable or-
der might be established.

try indefinitely.

It has been said that uni-
versity students are chiefly
important to society today as
potential consumers rather
than producers.

It remains that they are
important, that they have a
common framework in which
to organize (the university),
and that they will be heard.

As, CBS News remarked,
ah active minority can sign-
ificantly influence policy.

Not is to be gained by

sitting back with an inactive
and possibly apathetic ma-
jority.

The need for manifested
concern probably will arise
again in November. I would
like for Davidson College to
begin to plan now. Suspen-
sion of classes is not neces-
sary.

The position of the Nixon

to be opposed,-not the edu-

Stranger Than ‘Naked’

This past summer an important literary work
made its appearance and is destined to take its place
among the great creations of American literature.
It is one of the truly significant novels to come along
in many years, being completely a product of our
times. It is a book with impact, force, raw strength,
written in utter abandon.

I refer, of course, to “‘Naked Came
the Stranger.”

“Naked,” as many of you doubt- = /-
less recall, made.its debut this sum-. ¥ ~

mer to rather mixed critical ac-
claim, A “New York Times’ critic
said he wouldn’t recommend it to
any dodo, or something to that ef
fect. But the ‘Daily News’ and
“Playboy” reportedly loved it.
“Naked” came on as the result

of a mass production line of 25 Long Island newspa-
permen, most of whom work for “Newsday.” which
I believe failed to review it. Each wrofe one chapter,
although some of them had to be rewriiten later be-
cause the writing was too good.

When the opus was completed, the wife or sis-
ter of one of the men, I don’t remember which, was
engaged to pose for the rather suggestive picture on
the back cover and given the rather suggestive pgeu-
donymn of Penelope Ashe. She made the rounds of
the less literary publishing houses and induced Lyle
Stuart to accept the volume as her own personal ac-
count of life in suburbia.

Naturally, it was an instant bestseller, and the
well-endowed Ashe was hailed as the successor to
Jaqueline Susann, an honor indeed.

And now there are 25 newsmen on Long Island
getting rich. They claim that they chose the title for
the book because books with “naked” and “stranger”
in the title seemed to sell -botton- Now trey ave pran-
ning a sequel called “Stranger than Naked.”

ee questions this raises about what has come
over the American book-buying public are legion: do
President Nixon’s Sd iar Americans buy ese
books? Doesn’t the pitiful writing and unimaginative,
or sometimes imaginative, repetition of sex get a little
poring after a while? Just who buys all this pornog-

hy anyway?
a Lageing back over the bestsellers of the last cou-
ple of years, it seems that “The Exhibitionist,” “Val-
ley of the Dolls,” “Myra Breckinridge,” “The Love
Machine” and “Portnoy’s Complaint” were-tiot flukes
at all. But they certainly should have been.

There is nothing wrong with sex in literature, or
even sex for its own sake. But it is the shallow plots
and balky styles that make the current generation of
bestsellers objectionable. eee

What this adds up to is that in current fiction
there is no longer a distinction between good writing
and bad writing, but between clean and dirty books.

~~ The situation obviously calls for the setting up of
two separate bestseller lists. A prospective novel would
have to be evaluated for content to see which list it
was eligible for. Then the clean list could compete
against the dirty list, which would not be muck of
a contest.

But what if the clean books won,
stranger than naked.

Invites Contribution

In_next week's issue, this
space will contain the first
installment of a newly-creat-
ed column on fine arts. The
editors of the column will
be Tom Way and. C. L.
Cheshire, who have decided
to entitle their weekly con-
tribution **Column,’’ for lack
of a worse title.

The main purpose of the
article will be to attempt to
stimulate, or at least invite,
the Davidson student to be-
come aware of the contri-
bution of the fine. arts, i.e.,
literature, the graphic arts,
music, dramatic art and
dancing. :

Due to the cultural waste-
land at Davidson, the reason
for which some attribute to
student apathy and ethers to
a lack of opportunity te en-
Joy high quality entertain-
ment, the editors feel that a
breakthrough is needed.

The range of subjects could

deal with anything. from. the .

religion theater's activities

to ‘New York to the sociologi- ©

cal overtones of music by
the Fugs.
It is not intended to be a
article, as some
art columns seem to be, but
a column that will reflect
what is going on in the cul-
tural vein in the mirids, of
Davidson’s students and pro-
fessors.
Anyone from a freshman

poet to the Chairman of the remarks which he feels

Chemistry Dept. is invited to
submit works for publica-
tion. The only criteria are
that the work be original,
contain fewer than. 800
words, deal with a fine arts
related subject that is
‘now,’ and be considered to
have some appeal to the
Davidson student body.

If you've been unusually
complaining about the poor
quality of writing that
appears in THE DAVID-
SONIAN, this is your chance
to submit your work for pub-
lication.

The editors feel that too
much good writing is con-
cealed by the Davidson stu-
dent, while poor available
writing often serves as a
weak substitute.

If you’ve been anxious fer
the chance to have published
an epera critique, opinion or
an art exhibit, or hopefully
a work with a more uncom-
mon, exciting subject, the
opportunity now| exists.

Place the manuscript, with
your name, school, address,
c/o “Column,” in THE
DAVIDSONIAN box in the
Union or give it directly to
Editor Way or Cheshire.

As soon as a_ work is
chosen for publication, the
writer will be contacted, in-
vited to add any preparatory

necessary to the manuscript,
and permitted to submit his
personally finished copy of
the manuscript for printing.

Such:a practice will be the
policy of “Column,” because
the editors feel they sheuld
serve merely as selectors,
with each week's article
centering entirety areund the
chosen work and ifs auther.

The editors realize that
“Column” is not going to
create a giant revival in the
“culturally disinterested pat-
tern of the Davidson stu-
dent’s way of thinking,” (or
evidence thereof); nor is
“Column” going to serve as
& mouthpiece for the few
flaming liberals badmouth-
ing conservatives that clog
up so much of the literavy
mechinery around the Col-
lege. i!

The: article will not set the
hamlet of Davidson ablaze
with literary fire, ner will
it keep downtown Davidson’
from folding up and dying
every Wednesday. However,
it will serve as a first step,
a possible breakthrough in
our attitude toward the fine
arts.

Hopefully, some sign of
life—a few blades of grass
or a couple of weeds will suf-
fice—will sprout in our cul-
tural wasteland.
