_ Here are the results of the Student Health Leaders’ Relationship survey.
THIS IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC STUDY... While about one hundred students filled
out the survey, this is not
a great enough sample to
accurately represent the
whole of the Davidson
College student body.
The purpose of this sur-
vey and the Singled Out
dating game is to initiate a
discussion about relation-
ships at Davidson: what
we like about them, what.
we don’t like about them,
what we want to change,
and how we can change.
Again, this is not a scien-
tific study. The percent-
age of respondents who
agreed with the choice
will be listed next to the
choice, male first, then fe-
male.
