The Davidsonian

Work-Study involves

20%

Parnell discusses “ins and outs”

By AMANDA HALL

Twenty percent of Davidson
College students hold work-
study jobs, according to As-
sistant Director of Admissions
and Financial Aid Brenda
Parnell.

Theoretically the Federal
government funds 80 percent
of the jobs and the college
funds the rest, but ‘“‘we spend
a lot more than that because
we have more students who
work than funds we get,’’ said
Parnell.

The other funding comes
directly from Davidson, and
results in the college paying 50
percent of the work-study
wages.

Students who hold work-
study jobs receive $2.20 per
hour instead of minimum
wage.

‘‘We have permission from
the Federal government to pay
below minimum,”’ said Par-
nell. ‘‘It’s been done since
before I’ve been here and I
don’t know what the reasoning
is—just to stretch our funds a
little further I would say.”

Although different jobs en-
tail different amounts of ac-
tual work, all students are
paid the same amount.

“Students are paid to work
and they’re supposed to de-
vote their time to work,”’ said
parnell. ‘‘In some cases they
can study and I don’t think
that’s fair. I just don’t know
what can be done about it.

“Students are paid the same
amount and we get more out of
some than others.”’

To determine which stu-
dents receive financial aid,
‘‘we determine need,’’ said
Parnell.

A student with a small need
is given a job, while those with
larger needs receive a self-help
package of a loan and a job.

Part of the application for
financial aid is a form asking
whether a student would like a
large loan or a more time-con-
suming job. These forms are
considered heavily in deter-
mining aid, according to Par-
nell.

“It’s good for a student to
have more job because they
have less loan. With so many
of the students going on to
graduate school we try to keep
the loan down,” she said.

The maximum amount a
freshman may earn in a job is
$600, while an upperclassman
may earn $800-850. A student
must earn a minimum of $450
(freshmen) or $600 (upper-
classman) during the school
year in order to be eligible for
scholarship the next year.

This amount may be earned
through both work-study jobs
and jobs during vacations,
according to Parnell.

The upperclassmen have
first preference of jobs, accor-
ding to Parnell. The freshmen
‘‘get the jobs that are left
over.”’

The Department of Admis-

sions and Financial Aid sends
questionnaires to upperclass-
men asking where they would
and would not like to work,
and what special skills they
have.

At the same time they send
the job supervisors question-
naires asking what kinds of
special skills are necessary for
work in that department and
which students the office
would prefer to have working.

Parnell works around filling
the needs of departments like
languages, physics or chemis-
try that have special needs
when assigning jobs.

She assigns students to
supervisors who request them
first, unless the student re-
quested not to work there. She
then assigns upperclassmen to

their choices.

“Tt usually works out that
they get one of their first three
or four choices,’’ she said.

Parnell emphasized that a
student who has a problem
with his job should come see
either her or Director of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid H.
Edmunds White.

‘‘When a student has a
complaint and comes to me I
first try to work it out with the
supervisor,” she said.

“Tf students cannot get
enough hours they should
come to me and I'll find them
another job. The primary obli-
gation is to the first job, but if
the department doesn’t have
the hours the students are
entitled to they should have

another job,’’ she said.

Many work-study students
have complained that they do
not know*if they are under-
earning or overearning.

At the end of fall term
Parnell sent letters to these
students and their supervisors
informing them of their pay
status. Each check stub lists
how much a student has
earned and how much he still
needs to earn before the end of
the year.

Through these methods a
student can determine if he is
underearning or overearning
and adjust his hours.

“Work-study students are

the minimum,”’ said Parnell.

Work-study

Students tap three sources for financial aid

By AMANDA HALL

Davidson, College students
receive financial aid through
three sources: scholarships,
loans and work-study.

Although much of this aid
comes through the college,
many outside sources help
finance students, according to
Assistant Director of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid Bren-
da Parnell.

Parnell listed several schol-
arship funds besides the col-
lege: church and civic groups,
state programs, Basic Educa:
tion Opportunity Grant
(BEOG), National Merit and
ROTC.

She believes many of these
funds are available for upper-
classmen and suggests contac-
ting a high school guidance
counselor for information.

Besides loans through Dav-
idson Parnell mentioned the
Guaranteed Loan Program.

“The regulations have
changed so that more middle
income students can get
these,’’ she said. ‘‘If the
adjusted family income is less
than $25,000 the student can
receive the loan.”’

The Office of Admissions

and Financial Aid has infor-
mation on these loans.

Many job possibilities be-
sides work-study jobs are av-
ailable to students, according
to her. .

‘‘A few departments have
funds for students who are not
on financial aid, and there are
opportunities in the commun-
ity,’’ Parnell said. ‘‘There are
also jobs you see in the
announcement sheet.”

A number of students com-
plain that they cannot receive

financial aid if their financial
situation changes during the
school year.

Any time there is a financial
change Parnell emphasizes
that the student see either
herself or Director of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid H.
Edmunds White and amend
the Parents’ Confidential
Statement (PCS).

‘‘We have some money for
emergencies,’’ she said.

Students also complain that
they receive large financial aid

packages their freshman year,
which are gradually cut each
following year.

“We’re not in the business
to lure students to Davidson
with a good financial aid pack-
age,”’ said Parnell. ‘‘It would
be questioning our integrity
and the college’s integrity to
do that.

“There are instances of
where a student receives less
aid in the freshman year
because the reported income
for the year is more than pre-

dicted.”

Part of this amount is sub-
tracted from aid in the soph-
omore year, according to her.

Parnell and White try to
catch inconsistencies in pre-
dicted income before offering
financial aid, but adjust the
aid later if this cannot be done.

As part of this procedure
the Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid now requires
income tax statements from
freshmen applying for finan-
cial aid.

Work-stuc
pay-scale

Student ‘‘work-study’’ jobs
are not unique to Davidson
College. They constitute at
least a small portion of the
financial aid packages offered
to needy students at many
colleges and universities
throughout the United States.

The actual number of work-
study jobs, and the percentage
of total monetary awards they
comprise, varies from school
to school, but the administra-
tion of this form of grant is
similar in most institutions of
higher learning.

There is a long-standing
federally-funded program, the
National Direct Student Loan
(NDSL), that pays for jobs to
help relieve the rising costs of
college education. Some states
also provide money for the
schools to distribute through
work-study jobs.

Vanderbilt University

Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, Tennessee, has ab-
out 7000 undergraduate stu-
dents. Of these ‘‘no more than
200 have work-study jobs,”’

according to Ms. Roberta
Stevens of that school’s finan-
cial aid office.

She explained that most
students there do not need
financial aid, that that only 20
percent of their students re-
ceive any aid at all.

The pay for work-study jobs
begins at $2.30 an hour (the
federal Minimum wage) and
goes up, depending on the
student's skills and the type of
job performed. Stevens added
that most students perform
secretarial tasks or work
in the library.
