Credit Hours

credit. At present the College does not
give credit for these classes because it
does not consider them full courses.

He also commented that Davidson's
present system has “slighted” lab stu-
dents and the semester system will in-
crease the disparity between lab and non-
lab courses if the College does not adopt
a credit-hour system.

Lab students currently receive up to
80 contact hours per term and still re-
ceive the same credit as students who re-
ceive only 50 hours a term in class.
Under a semester system without credit
hours, lab students would receive the
same credit for 90 contact hours as non-
lab students would receive for 45.

Wolf also mentioned that credit-
hours would help professors adjust their
workloads.

Further, he said that that credit hours
would allow classes meeting five days a
week, such as language courses and
humanities, to receive full credit for their
extra contact hours.

A Course Is a Course

Religion professor Max Polley main-
tained that a credit-hour system would be
“awfully complicated” and still favors
the idea that ‘ta course is a course.”

Polley also warned that under a cred-
it-hour system students could “eat up a
lot of hours” in courses that may cut
down on the breadth of their education.

Wolf suggested that the College
could stick with certain core require-

ments in order to prevent students from
narrowing the scope of their education.

Religion professor David Kaylor sees
“advantages and disadvantages” in the
credit-hour system. He feels that it would
“probably be better’ to evaluate the

“whole package” of semester system ad-
justments before adopting a credit-hour
system.

College President Samuel Spencer
believes that the credit-hour system and

the course system both would work. On
the whole, however, he still favors a
course system. He agrees with the
rationale behind the course system of
avoiding the “mechanical nature of the

credit-hour system.”

Registrar Richard C. Burts doesn’t
see “any particular need” for a credit-
hour system, but he said that “‘if it’s what
the Faculty wants, then they can have it.”

Although Wolf presented the propo-
sal to the Faculty, he said that 40 other
people have presented it. Wolf, Chemis-
try professor Roger Nutt, and other pro-
fessors brought the proposal to the Facul-
ty last week, but Wolf said he had been
considering a credit-hour system since
last fall.

Referendum

(Continued from page 1)

' vey he undertook before the referendum

petition began. “It will reflect the 48 per-
cent who didn’t vote in the referendum,”
he said. “It should destroy the argument
that the ones who didn’t vote would be

’ more likely to support total self-selec-

tion.” Gould hopes to have the survey
completed by Monday.

Gould hopes to get the Senate to vote
on the proposal this Tuesday but doubts
any further action will be taken this year.
“We don’t have a direction set right
now,” said SGA President Hunter Mon-
roe. He said the next step would be to
present a package of information includ-
ing the PCSC study and the results of the
referendum and the survey to the Council
on Campus and Religious Life.

According to the College Constitu-
tion, a proposal approved by a majority
vote in a referendum can be communi-
cated to the Trustees as a ‘‘Petition for ac-
tion.”

presentation and allocation of funds” for
the decrease.

Hobart Park funding rose $1,000 to
$4,000 on a request of $6,000, the great-
est increase from the *82-83 budget. Co-
editor Scot Myers felt a large increase
was necessary to make magazine distri-
bution and technical quality equal the
quality of submissions to the magazine.
“I’m not unhappy; it was expected,” said
Myers of the decision, “but I’m not satis-
fied.”

The Miscellany requested and re-
ceived $3,400, enough to finance two is-
sues. “I’m quite pleased,” said Co-editor
Stewart Cauley. “It was a fair com-
promise.” Cauley had to defend his right
to request ATC funds because the
magazine uses faculty editors and non-
student contributions. A resolution was
passed in the Senate stating that an or-
ganization must be student run to be
funded. But Cauley convinced the ATC
that The Miscellany is student run and
should receive money. The committee
advised that the magazine should pursue
more student responsibility and outside
aid.

The Wildcat Handbook obtained
$550 on a request of $600. Editor Fr-

ances Palmer was “a little disappointed.
We were asking for the bare minimum.”
She added that only two years ago the
handbook received $1,350, but Palmer
felt certain she could raise the money
through ad sales. The ATC agreed: “a lit-
tle more persistance” in selling space
would solve the problem, it advised.

The Youth Student Service Corps, a
first-time recipient, acquired $600 on a
request of $1,300. Director Doug
Ammar said that the money was a special
measure for one or two years to rejuve-
nate the Y-Corps. He explained that the
members spent too much time raising
money to recruit freshmen or perform
services.

Amnesty International, another first-
time group, received $400 on a $1,500
request. “I’m disappointed we didn’t re-
ceive more, but wasn’t surprised at what
we got,” said Al Coordinator Hunter
Monroe. Monroe aiso said that AI has
tremendous support and can raise its own
funds, “but it could easily do more” with
more money from the ATC.

Davidson Christian Fellowship re-
ceived $400 of a $500 request. President
Frank Ivey described himself as “res-
igned,” but he “didn’t expect much

more.” DCF, he says, is losing out due to
inflation because their allotment has not
increased since 1980. Because most of
their budget comes from the members of
DCF, the request covers only campus-
wide events.

The Artists Series requested and re-
ceived $7,000 as it has regularly for the
past decade. Previous recipients, the
Women’s Center, Freshmen Com-
muniqué, carrier current radio station
WDSR, and the Residence Hall Council
no longer receive ATC funding.

The Activities tax grew 5 percent this
year to $50 per student, mostly because
need forced the ATC to overspend last
year’s tax money by $6,600. But this has
not solved the problem; the ATC again
went overbudget, this year by $3,000.

Reactions were generally favorable
to another raise, but the feeling is less
powerful than before. While most stu-
dent groups said they were satisfied,
most wanted more. “If it was raised, the
money would be well used,” said Mon-
roe.
Ammar agreed. “It should be raised
to handle all the new organizations on
campus such as Fellowship of Christian
Athletes, the Nuke group, AI and the

Women’s Concerns group,” he said.
Myers disagreed: “There’s plenty of
money to give out, but much of it goes to
the wrong places. It doesn’t need to be
increased — just redistributed.”

Tully said the ATC will probably
phase out Y-Corps, DCF, and AI fund-
ing over the next several years. DCF and
Al face significant student opposition to
their perceived position on campus. The
Y-Corps will stop receiving the money
because it will not need it in several
years.

The whole process went smoothly
and fairly, Tully said. Davidson College
Business Manager Robert Currie was
also pleased.

The committee reviewed the budget
requests and heard arguments during in-
terviews on Wednesday and Thursday of
last week. Each member completed a
personal assessment of what the budget
should be; these were compared and a
consensus was reached on Friday.

The members of the ATC are Tully,
Currie, Union Director C. Shaw Smith,
Dean of Students Will Terry, Ester Kim,
Kathleen Huff, Danny Waddill, and Pat
Sellers.
