Poets exibit unique blend of oratory and music

By STEVE MANK

A poet who reads before a crowd pos-
seses a skill most need not — or do not
have. If the wit is in front of a group he or
she must restrain the epic similes and com-
plicated analogies or risk falling flat on his
or her metaphoric face.

It takes a peculiar talent to entertain a
group of stodgy, self-proclaimed literary
critics. The bard/initiate may please them
with the greatest work since Paraa*re Lost
replete with a host of divine beings and
literary devices to match. Or, as happened
last night, woo them out of their conserva-

tive sensibilities.

North Carolina poets Clyde Edgerton,
Shelby Stephenson and Stephen Smith do
not just know the South, they have a pecul-
iar ability to see and express life in the south
as few others can.

Their homeland is not a wasteland wait-
ing for the last belch of the kudzu that de-
vours it. Nor is it some utopian city of gold
wating to happen.

It’s just folks. Folks who as adolescents
lose splendid opportunities to grasp the for-
bidden fruit of a five-foot-two, newly blos-
soming tree of knowledge.

Folks whose parents were beaten and

who thank God, and whoever else, that they
were not treated similarly.

The three lovingly told their tales as
they brought the audience through a whole
gamut of emotions. They had keen insight
into life down home and, after all, the world
over.

Each read his poetry telling hilarious
tales of good old boys in love; or the con-
flicts one must endure when the time had
come to slaughter pigs; or the ponderous
musings of, and on, an old fiddle player.

Between the readings the three would
pick up instruments and dive head first into
rousing versions of songs we all know and

love as well as a few of their own. When
Edgerton lamented the trials and tribula-
tions of being less than six feet tall in Texas,
where they “eat Ph.D’s for breakfast,”
every one in the house was duly glad it was
him instead of them.

While they exhibited very different poe-
tic styles, each was equally adept at keeping
the audience from getting a little too com-
fortable. And though the event was adver-
tised as a “coffeehouse,” Stephenson,
Edgerton and Smith were successful in
making it nothing less than an erudite
hootenany.

Religion professor Clark creates ‘wood spirits’

By NELLE McCORKLE

Pressing a tiny seashell into
green clay, Tom Clark 49 deco-
rates a Christmas tree surrounded
by small chubby clay figures with
distinct, cheerful expressions.
Clark calls these modeled charac-
ters wood spirits and he usually
completes one statue each week at
his Thomas F. Clark company
studios on Grey Road outside
Davidson.

A mixture of pecan shells and
rosin poured into the mold repro-
duces Clark's artwork; _ fifty
people work at his Troutman plant
manufacturing packaging 2,000
of these copies daily. Each statue
is hand-painted, employing an ad-
ditional 100 area residents who
work in their homes after complet-
ing a six-week training course.
“Some variation is allowed in the
handpainting,” said Clark. “It
makes it a better sculpture.” The
painter signs his or her name un-
derneath the base of the work.

Represented in over 4,000
stores, Clark's sculptures are col-
lected by individuals in every

U.S. county. Clark’s business
began while he was a Davidson
religion professor working in his
studio during spare hours. “A

former student, Joe Poteat,
brought in a businessman who
wanted 100 statues right away.”
Poteat suggested he and Clark
form a company; Poteat is now na-

tional sales manager. Currently

planning construction of a 40,000
square-foot Mooresville plant for
reproducing Clark’s sculptures,

Poteat also represents other artists
through his Cairn studios.

Clark’s association ~——with
gnomes (‘‘I call them wood spirits
because I live in the woods”)
began “by accident” in Brevard,
NC during the summer of 1978.
Serving as Camp Carolina chap-
lain, Clark sculpted portrait busts
of campers and counselors.

“One day,” he said, “a coun-
selor was to come pose, but he
didn’t come: he'd decided to play
soccer instead. I had just bought
The Book of Gnomes by Will
Huygen; illustrated by Rien
Poortvliet. The book includes an
illustration of a statue of a gnome:
“I thought I would copy that, but I
quickly switched, and that’s how
it all began. The finished statue is
a copy of the gnome on the cover,
‘Forest Gnome.’”

Although his original order in-
volved a gnome, Clark estimates
one-third of his 350 sculptures
available as reproductions are not
gnomes, but are “miniature
people.” Figures in this category
include Shakespeare, Hamlet,
Daniel Boone, Santa Claus, Flor-
ence Nightingale, Rip Van
Winkle and, most recently, a Con-
federate soldier. “We check out li-

brary books to find pictures, so
there’s research, but I'm not stick-
ing too closely to it. By the end of
the war, people were wearing any-
thing, and I was afraid if I made
the costume too authentic, he'd
look as if he’d never been to war,”
Clark said of his clay soldier.

likenesses may originate from
portraits or photographs, but
Clark denied that any sculptures
are based on Davidson citizens,
except one which depicts Chal-
mers Davidson. “It’s
‘Ney’,” Clark said. “The fellow is

leaning on a podium, protecting «

called

the college seal, and Chalmers =; !

protects the traditions of the col-
lege.”

A Davidson religion professor
for 27 years, Clark possesses “lots
of Davidson connections.” His
grandfather was a classmate of
Woodrow Wilson's; his father,
three uncles, five first cousins and
13 second cousins are alumni.
Current family involvement con-
sists of math professors Robert
Whitton and assistant director of
the library Mary Beaty, both of
whom are Clark’s first cousins
once removed.

“Well, I love it,” Clark said of
the college. “Davidson is very
much my home because of all my
family having gone here and my
having taught here so many years.
I stress that everywhere I go and
talk about the college,” Clark said
of his 120 annual store promo-
tional visits. “Nearly everywhere
I go, I see one of my old students.
It’s like small alumni meetings; |
give my schedule to the alumni of-
fice and they sometimes plan an
alumni meeting when I’m going
pretty far afield.”

“The unique thing about me is
that my second vocation passed
my first. . . . My life is just be-
ginning. I’m working harder than
I ever worked before.”

Clark’s art interest began
when he was a_ child in
Elizabethtown, N.C. “I drew all
the time — I copied pictures from
magazines.” —

“In about the second grade,

around me would get me to draw
theirs.”

Later, as a Davidson student,
“I always had two sheets of paper
— one to draw the professor and
one to take notes. I wasn’t a very
good student — it was almost a
compulsion to draw.”

After graduating from David-
son, Clark attended Union
Theological Seminary while

simultaneously enrolled at the
Richmond Polytechnical Institute
studying art in night school. An
ordained minister, he served as a
Burlington, N.C. church’s youth
director and as an associate pastor
at a Bluefield, W.V. church. He
received his Ph.D. from the Uni-
versity of Aberdeen; while in
Scotland he studied at the Roberts
School of Art.

“There was a daytime me and
a nighttime me,” Clark said of
these years. During this time,
Clark began to specialize in
sculpture. He has painted, but
claims, “I was not good at it. . . I
was very frustrated with it. I found
I was trying to mold the paint on
the canvas.”

“T still sketch a little,” Clark
said, but added he never prepares
a preliminary drawing for a statue.
“The sketch kills the statue,” he
said. “I did that at first.”

“I have a pretty good idea of
the finished work's appearance
when I begin. Details I will not
have worked out, and the last
thing I find out is the name.

“All have names, and that’s
one of the things that sells the
statues. They’re old fashioned
names; I don’t have any
*Snigglesnerts’. These little crea-
ture are all very happy, and people
respond to them in that manner.”

Clark stresses that the figures
are not caricatures, but portraits.
Although he sketched students
during office discussions and each
member of a faculty committee as
he or she spoke while serving as
committee secretary, Clark said,

Tom Clark and some of his creations.

“T like all of my little people, and |
liked all of my students, so I was
not trying to make fun of them.”

Clark uses colored industrial
modeling clay for his works. “I’m
a modeler, not a carver,” he said,
‘so I build up in small pieces, |
don’t subtract, I add.” While
major works are in progress, he
generally consults the production
staff about the feasibility of repro-
duction. Regarding final deci-
sions on original artworks, he
said, “I’m just the creator, but the
buck stops here.” He noted that
Troutman plant workers “follow
me like a train of seagulls follow-
ing a shrimp boat” when he ap-
pears with a new sculpture.

A Clark trademark is a small
coin pressed into most of his origi-
nal sculptures. Some friends send
Clark foreign coins. Others send
more unusual items: “The dentist
downtown sent me children’s
teeth,” which Clark incorporated
into ‘The Tooth Fairy.’ Tiny clay
candy surrounds a decayed tooth;
a penny appears next to clean teeth
at the beaming tooth fairy’s feet.

Clark refused to name a favor-
ite sculpture: “If I said, they’ed all
get up and walk out.” He said he
does not have a favorite subject,
but considers the miniature people
more demanding. “I might do one
of those and then a wood spirit.”

“Ideas,” Clark said, “are the
easiest part of the business. I was
eating a banana this morning, and
as I was peeling it back, I thought,
‘My goodness, it looks like a
Siberian hat.’ So I'm doing one
with a Siberian hat.”
