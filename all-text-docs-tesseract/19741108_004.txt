No News |

Good News

_ Every once in a whil@, we recognize
just how exciting a placq Davidson
College really is. This is one of those
times. The expression ‘‘No news is
good news’’ comes readily to mind,
and do we have some good news for
Davidson this week!

The lack of news this week is not
unique to Davidson. The NBC
Evening News resorted to running a
feature about people riding a bus bet-
ween_New York and Boston. This
mobilized man-on-the-street in-
terview may have been the dullest
story of the year. The transit riders
had few opinions, little interest in
news, little faith in the political news

With coverage of the Watergate.

scandals declining, there seems to be
a lack of people making news.
Newspaper Executive Randolph
Hearst’s daughter was kidna
earlier this year, followed by the kid-
napping of Atlanta Constitution
Editor Reg Murphy. Not content with
kidnapping only newswriters, editors,
and their families, it seems that now,
some sinister force has kidnapped the
news.

_ Perhaps this is just as well. As
issues go, Davidson has proven itself
fruitful this term.

‘munication created

Certainly the laundry, substandard
housing and the yearbook con-
troversy have tried the patience of
many, but was all of the rigorous
siding necessary? Regarding the
yearbook, the student editors lacked

ement, but the president’s office
cked tact. There was no need for the
bitterness incurred.

Our point is the same the
indry. Davidson is a
small college that often seems to han-

_dle its troubles like a large university-

Steps have been taken to establish a
new student publications advisory
board, and word has it that it will be
given teeth. How does the student ap-
proach this? Hie

The best answer is in good faith.
Students are capable of deciding for
themselves what should properly be
included in student publications, and
the new board will hopefully provide
a forum for student discussion of
policy without the threat of heavy-
handed administrative censorship.

It follows that faulty com-

“Letters To The Editor

Locked Doors Slur

Feminine Virtues

To the Editor:

With all of the other women
who live in Watts dorm, I have
watched the building of our

- spectacular new bullet proof,

bomb proof, rapist proof card-
lock door. .
I feel that these doors are a

waste of the school’s money :

anda slur on the responsibility
of the freshman women.

To keep unwanted in-
dividuals out of my room, I
need only to lock my door. I
doubt that many muggers and
rapists will search out the
house manager and ask her
for the pass key.

It seems that the ad-
ministration does not credit us
with the responsibility to lock

My home is near Randolph-
Macon College where a girl
was brutally murdered last
year. She was being chased
across the campus, but since
the nearest building was
locked, she was at the mercy
of the murderer. No one has,
to my knowledge, been
molested inside of the Ran-
dolph-Macon dorms.

If being pursued, am I to ask
the rapist to wait while I fum-

ble through my pockets to find
my card or even worse to wait
thirty minutes until the guard
arrives?

I have been told that the
card-lock system will not give
us a curfew, but I am
suspicious of this because, af-
ter all, the curfew rules are on
the books and I have seen too
many cases of equal rules for
the sexes With unequal en-
forcement.

Iam sure that there will be
a push from some of the alum-
ni to give us a real curfew, and
the card-lock system would

make enforcement very easy. —

At this late date it would
take drastic action onthe part

of the students to get rid of the °

card-lock door. The ad-
ministration has already
spent our money on it and
would not want to let all of this
fine new equipment go to
waste, but they have not put
the new screens up yet.

I live on first floor and I do
not want to have to look out

Let’s let the administration

fortification of Watts. I believe

‘that it is an affront to the

To the Editor:

Let me take this opportunity
to heartily congratulate those
thoughtful souls who so
delightfully decorated some of
Davidson’s trees _ this
Halloween.

Tumbling out of bed and
peering out my window in the
morning, my ocular sense is
enraptured ‘by the flowing
white ribbons of translucent
tissue streaming from the
boughs of our venerable
vegetation. ‘

And such scintillating
beauty is to be had at such a
paltry price. Certainly_all of
us can tolerate an untidy
posterior for a time.

Therefore, may I suggest
that the adornment of. our
heretofore §unornamented
foliage commence  im-
mediately.
