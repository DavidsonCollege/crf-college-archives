THE DAVIDSON'!

°

: We Dood It Again

Everybody prayed for it, but few really expected the “thir

red line’ to stand up under the punch of Doc Newton’s: best
Wolfpack team since he has beem coaching at State. So it]

was a jubiliant bunch of 'Cats who trudged off the turf o
Wilmington’s Legion Stadium with a well-earned tie witl
that much-vaunted Wolfpack. lt was an equally jubilan

Game Sidelights

At the beginning of the game the crowd was defi-
nitely pro-State and was prepared to see the ’Cats
take a thorough trouncing. By the end of the first
quarter the tables were definitely turned, and by the
end of the game, the masses of Khaki-clad service men
had formed a Davidson cheering section. Ex-manager

Vosburgh was seen carrying the downs marker (in uni-

form). Ex-Wildcat Stan Yoder (also in uniform) was

very much.in_the thick of things. Publicists Gene

Sutton and Lacy McLean got in their plugs over the air

waves, Sutton’s being somewhat of the whoop whoop

type, while McLean restricted himself to a few quiet
remarks at half time. At the other end of the line there
was considerable criticism of the aforesaid Mr. Reid’s
partality to State, which is understandable but hardly
forgivable. According to the loudspeaker Davidson
had exactly six guards in the game at one time: It was
never possible to tell just who was playing. To this
criticism, with no hard feelings intended, this column
adds a hearty amen.

A Look at the Future

With Duke on tap in Winston-Salem Saturday, the ’Cats
are working hard to make a good showing. Their stock was
boosted considerably by last week’s game, and Duke is as yet
an unknown quantity. Wallace Wade is gone from the Duchy
of Durham as are most*of the glamour boys who played in the
transplanted Rose Bowl on New Year’s day. , But the Devils
always turn up with a powerful team and this year should be
no exception with the team tinder the able tutoring of
Eddie Cameron, who has been at Duke long enough to learn
many of the wily Wade’s ways. There are a host of capable
reserves to take over the big shoes of the.bowl boys. Anyway
the Davidson's are out to continue in their role of “siant-
wounders” (if not killers).

While the ’Cats have their hands full in’ Bowman Gray
Stadium, eyes will also be on the other opening Big Five and
Southern Conference games. Especially will Davidsonians be
interested in how Carolina fares with Wake Forest, for some-
how they figure that his may be the year to take the Tar Heels,

Those Cardinals

In the midst of all this football talk, can’t help but
say a word of praise for the Gas House Gang, better
known as the St.Louis Cardinals of -the-senior major
league baseball circuit. If it were not-for the prepon-
derance of Bum fans in the vicinity, yours truly would
dwell at length on the superb performance of a great
ball club in doing the seemingly impossible feat of
practically clinching the league pennant. after trailing
by over seven games a few weeks ago. What’s that
record? Four games won out of the last 40 played or
something like that ... Oh well, nuff said... Thirty.

before_

Hoover, school opened,

man W. Shepard on the freshman
eleven.

An end on the powerful Appala-
chian team of '39 and. ’40, Hoover
has had two years of coaching ex-
perience at Wingate. His tenure at
Davidson may. be cut short, how-
ever, since is enlisted in the

will assume complete control of the
