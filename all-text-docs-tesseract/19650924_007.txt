Fleet Freshmen
Capture Cakes

By LARRY NORPLEET

Davidsonian Sports Writer
Last Tuesday afternoon the freshmen of Davidson
College emerged from their rooms and ventured out to
Sprunt Field to sport their physical prowess in the an-

nual Davidson Cake Race.

After a false start by a few
eager 69'’ers, the race finally
got underway. and 297 flashing
red beanies went traipsing
through woods, down hills, up
roads, and finally lapping the
football field. There the first 70
finishers reached that long
sought-after finish line and a
delicious cake, provided by the
female segment of Davidson's
population.

In a dramatic finish Mike
Moats of Winnetka, Ill. beat out
fellow freshman, Rand Phillips,
at the wire by a split second.

Moats finished the course in a
time of 9:59. This was 1:24.5 off
the record time set by Pete
Ashcraft in 1948. Cross-country

coach Heath Whittle ventured,
“Asheraft's record of 8:34.5 will
probably never be broken.”

Both Moats, a product of New
Trier High School, and Phillips,
who hails from Winston-Salem,
have already been recruited by
Coach Whittle as freshmen cross- ’
country prospects.

This year’s honors for last
place went to speedy Charles
Skinner. Skinner, in a blazing
finish. threatened to break the
all-time reodrdyfor last place
when he strélléd in some fifteen
minutes later. than the winner,

Soccer Squad Shoots
At Successful Season |

The 1965 version of the Wildcat soccer squad seeks
to better last year’s 7-4 record beginning October 1 here

against Pembroke College.

Coach Harry Fogleman com-
mented, ‘‘The team has looked
surprisingly good in the prac-
tices. which have consisted of
drills on the fundamentals and
of conditioning for the running
involved in soccer.”

The strong point of the team
will undoubtedly be the defense:
Returning lettermen John Barn-
hardt and Kem Anderson will
handle the goal while Glenn
Hanes, Gus Brown, and How-
ard Morris will provide strength
and experience at the fullback
positions. Among the halfbacks
George Brown has looked strong
in practice.

SOCCER COACH HARRY FOGLEMAN
ltching Ta Start

Graduated star Jan Brakel will
be missed on the line but Rich-
ardson Scholars Juergen Ewald
and Peter Carnwath should pro-
vide scoring threats. Other
standouts have been Lewis Foss,
Lee Fanning, and Ben Nzengu.

Coach Fogleman pointed out
that he has been well pleased by
the work that the sophomores
have been doing.

An eleven game schedule will
culminate with the Southern
Conference tournament here on
November 19-20. Home games
with N. C. State, Furman, and
Duke promise to be the big
ones.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

STAMPEDING 69‘ERS RACE FOR FIRST BITE

| BEG TO DIFFER

“| don’t think they are better coached,” said
Furman’s head football mentor Bob King in Tues-
day’s Columbia State. “Coach Bill Dole had some fine
teams. They just have more talent to work with.”

I beg to differ.

And I hope Mr. King shows this same lack of
perceptiveness when he prepares his team for Sat-
urday after he watches films of last week’s romp of
a completely out-classed Presbyterian team.

Personnel-wise Davidson is made up of about
the same. natural ability (maybe not as much) that
they had last year when they compiled a 3-6 record.
or the year before when they were 1-5-2, or before
that when they were 3-5-1.

Anybody who has seen Davidson play very often
the past few years had to be surprised by Saturday’s
game. Even the “‘experts” who picked Davidson re-
fused to give them more than a seven point spread
(with one notable exception).

However, Mr. King is right when he says we
“have more talent to work with” this year. But he
misses the point entirely by not realizing why. -

Coach Smith and his staff have turned gripes
into cheers not only on the sports page of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, but also on the team.

The enthusiasm generated has given the ‘“‘same
old players” new life and confidence; consequently
he gets more out of his players than they ever
thought they could give a year ago. So, you're right,
Mr. King, there is more “talent” to work with.

But did you ever miss the mark on your first
observation. Davidson is obviously a better coached
team than last year’s, which shellacked your Purple
Paladins 23-0.

Not only do they play harder and better, but
tens of little things stand out with this year’s “New
Look”.

Little things really highlight the difference,
things like chancing a fake punt early in the game or
like an on-sides kick to prevent a last second kick-off
return for a score in the first half (and maybe get
back on the scoreboard ourselves in the process).

Even things like clapping hands with every
push-up, or uniformly breaking out of the huddle as
the quarterback slaps his hands and rises from one
knee, or all the defense kneeling on the same knee
at the 35 before a kick-off. these little “unimportant”
things give a team class, reflect confidence and pre-
cision, and shout to even’ the deafest idiot the effec-
tiveness and ability of a new coach and his staff.

Maybe last year’s team could have stopped the
obviously out-played, out-conditioned, and out-class-
ed PC team that came here last week-end; maybe
but I'm not so sure, and I doubt by 35-0.

With a 1-0 record only a fool would dare jeopar-
dize his predicting perfection. But I can’t resist the
chance to say Davidson 21—Furman 13.

{QUOTES FROM THE WEEK

“When | took over here, I knew there would be
days like that,”—-PC head football coach Cally Gault
on last Saturday.

“We will have to make our decision as to wheth-
er or not to try to add temporary bleachers by the
number of early requests for tickets, which we
have,”—Davidson Athletic Director Tom Scott on
football seating.

GLIDEWELL (21) SCORES ON TOSS FROM POOLE

Hapless Hoser Looks On

Last week’s play execution
was hurt by the fact that the
game itself was ‘‘the boys’ first
scrimmage.” Nevertheless the
35 points they racked up illus-
trated the potential power they
will be ready to unleash against
the Paladins Saturday.

Concerning Furman's individ-
ual power, first to be noted are
quarterback Sammy Wyche and
receiver Tim Crawford. Both

_ voys are bucking for pro con-

tracts.

Wyche. who will direct his
team from.a pro-type offense, is
known for: his. hot-dogging type
play. He loves to fake-and-run,
and as Coach Smith remarked
about him, "He gives beautiful
fakes, and the containers (ends)
will have to watch him. Wyche
is 100 per cent improved over.
last’ year.”

When the Paladins go to the
air, as. they surely will do, the
number one target man will be °
Crawford, a split end with fin-
gers like glue.

In the 35 meetings of the two
teams the 'Cats have been vic-
torious only ten times, but at
the same time are shooting to
make it'two in a row, tomor-
tow.

Jacobsen Shines In Cat Romp

By TOMMY COX
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The spring football scrim-
mage at the end of last year
gave Davidson football fans,
numb with the meager show-
ings of previous seasons, a
scintillating eagerness. The
debut of coach Homer
Smith’s “New Look,” a 35-0
rout of a good Presbyterian
team, showed fans that: Da-
vidson had, if not a great
team, the promise of one.

More positively, it revealed

that Jace Jacobsen. a question
mark last spring. is a quarter-
back, and a fine one. Before suf-
fering a rib separation in the
last half, Jacobsen electrified
the Richardson Field stands with
pinpoint passing (seven for nine)
and superb scrambling.

This summer Jake worked
with other college players from
area schools on the weaknesses
that he observed in the spring

practice, Jake commented, ‘I i,

worked. on discipline as a pass-
er instead of just throwing. I

try to know and look for the se-

“We're thrilled with victory! We are especially pleas-

ed because we won convincingly even though the heat
and the humidity proved-to be as much an enemy as the —

opponents.”

Homer Smith's words related
what a sellout crowd of. 8,000
fans ‘at the Davidson: Presbyteri-
an game saw from the stands. A
fast-moving. hard-hitting Wild-
cat teami ‘streaked past: the Blue

Quarterback Jake Jacobsen
piloted the ‘Cats to 395 total
yards gained. Steve Smith, high-
ly-touted fullback, had a fine
day rushing with 93 net yards in
23 attempts.

Pete Glidewell grabbed two
passes from Jimmy Poole for
touchdowns. Jacobsen hit Ken
Kendall and Billy Taylor with
scoring aerials. The only rushing

marker was added by Johnny
Walker ‘on a scoring plunge.
Jim Terry added all five con-

versions rounding out the 35-0

score.

The scoring only tells half the
story of the game's success. A
stout defensive team, led by
captain Pack Hindsley, held PC
to a mere 78 vards gained all
day. This performance enabled
the offensive team to keep pos-
session of the ball most of the
game.

mentum than they had in the

_Jacobsen then began talking
about the team and Coach Smith.
“Coach Smith knows what he
wants from us and from his for-
mations. His pass systems, for
instance, make it easy and nat-
ural for the passer to follow the
sequence of receivers. He's

‘We worked hard up at camp
(the team was at Camp Carolina
for pre-season drills). Everyone
worked, even the players who
knew they wouldn't be playing.
That's the sort of attitude that .

Returning to the practice field,
Jacobsen began loosening up

pass systems, and reciting for-
mations — "Spread right, spread

IMAC Flickerball Tilts Slowly Get Underway

By STEVE BROWN

Davidsonian Sports Wrtier
n:| Flickerball regained its
: ~ i/annual prominence on the

campus Wednesday as the
season officially opened
“\ with the ATO’s overcoming
.|a scrappy Independent team
i! 18-14. Thursday’s action in-
cluded only two games; the
Kappa Sigs came back in
the second half to defeat
the Sigma Chi team after
being behind by 6 points at
the half, and the SAE’s slip-
ped by the Pikas 25-19.
Last year's flickerball season
(Photo by Lesesne): champions, the Kappa Sigs, ac-
cording to defensive man Tom-
my Cox, are planning to ‘‘win

’em all again this year."’ even
though they will have a “big
hole to fill ‘at tailback. from
Buddy Dubose, who graduated

last year."

The Phi Gams, however, be-
hind the arm of Dan Sweet and
the passcatching of David King
and Rusty Brannon, have drawn
a bead on the Kappa Sigs and,
according to Charlie Perry ‘will
finish high.’

Jim Appleby rates the Sigma
Chis as possible contenders,
stating that the team is com-
posed of basically -the same
group as last year and that it
will have a strong rush despite
the loss of some speed. Geordie
Mueller, picked by Appleby as

‘ertheless

“the best tailback in the league”
will be calling the signals.

The Pi Kapps. say quarter-
back Tuck Jones, will be play-
ing a lot of sophomores, but
will be looking for some good
plays from ends Charlie Taylor
and Paul Curlee.

The SAE’s rate their defense
as a strong point, according to
Barry Bishop. They will lean
heavily on the tailbacking of
Mike Booe.

Dariny Layman, halfback for
the Sig Eps, rates his team as
lacking somewhat in depth and
speed, but regards them nev-
as possible dark
horses. : .

Dave Townsend of the ATO's

was. somewhat more reluctant
to make a prediction about his
team’s future—"‘There’s really
no way to tell for sure how we'll
stand because there are going to
be a lot of upsets this year."

The KA seven “have been
working real hard and are much
improved over last year,”’ says
Tommy Hunter enigmatically.
No doubt they will count highly
on Grey Winfield. -

The Phi Delts are likewise
emphasizing the value of prac-
tices. According to Ronnie
Hunt, “Just like Homer Smith,
what we lack in material, we
plan to make up for by condi-
tioning and precision training.”

Frank Powell lists the Betas’

defensive unit as their strong
point, citing a pre-season scrim-
mage game in which the defense
intercepted five passes. Powell
termed his team a “‘light. fast
group directed by a versatile
tailback, Jack Sherrill.”

Ed Winslow, center for the
Pikas, characterized his team
as being “intense and tight,”
John Gresham and Bob O’Kelley
are expected by their team-
mates to be standouts.

Jim Clark lamented the Inde-
pendents’ slow start in getting
organized, but predicted that
“once we get rolling, we should
be pretty good.”

Sigma Nu Dave White be-

moaned his team’s loss of its

best tailback to the junior year
abroad program, but found hope
for the team in the perform-
ance of the Nu ends, John
Mason and Bill Barnette.

Because of the deferred ‘rush
plan currently in effect, IMAC
President Tommy Hunter an-
nounced, flickerball teams have
been set up in freshmen dorms—
two teams each from Cannon
and East and one from Watts.

The fresamen, who will have
their own IMAC representative,
will be organized into groups
by their hall representatives and
will play only other freshmen,
Hunter pointed out that the frosh
slate, which begins Monday, will
have its own champion and its
own season trophy.
