THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1993

Beyond Birkenstock ...

Looks Like It's Peek Time.

Ugh, the Birks feellike@#$%.
Although we’d like to blame the
Clinton administration (or should

~ we say the “Rodham Administra- -

tion?”) for our illness, in fact that
shock has already passed (like the
proverbial prune). As loyal Ameri-
cans, we’re glad to give Slick
Willey his day in court. No pre-
judgment or narrow-mindedness
around here, boy. We gladly as-
sume the media’s patina of OB-
JECTIVE JOURNALISM (yeah,
and Dan Rather

a whole bunch of promises during
that thar’ onery campaign,
kemosabie. Referring to the Char-
lotte Observer, “The nation’s old-
estcivil rights group declared Tues-
day that President Clinton must
back up his promises to black
Americans with billions of dollars
in economic help for inner cities
and civil rights laws.” Indeed,
anyone given an iron-clad, no-
doubt-about-it, Clinton guarantee
can certainly expect that promise

Urban League, that many more
resources need to be devoted to the
inner-cities. Who knows if Presi-
dent Clinton and Co-President
Rodfiam Clinton will ever get
around to those pesky economic
and social issues. Its soooo impor-
tant that he jump right on the gays-
in-military issue, right away.
Meanwhile, Joe and Tawanna
Taxpayer (youremember, the 47%
of the voters who actually. elected
this goof) are wondering whatever
happened to the

they were promised.
“Oh, but that’s acam-
paign promise,” our
diligent liberal friends
will respond. “Don’t
measure him by his
promises but by his
actions.” Excuse us?
Are you suggesting
that fulfilling an oral
committment is less
important than, say,
honorable service
while in office? For
the amount of time
you fools tortured

awful. We now re-
turn you to your regularly sched-
uled political harangue.)

Let’s review some news of the
day, shall we? “Agent goes ape in
gorilla suit, nabs Suspects.” Big
deal. “(Crews wx i
for ship.” Who Cates.
confused by new district lines.”
Surprise—nobody ever went broke
underestimating the intelligence of
the American public. . Anything
else? Well, there’s “Congress in
uproar over gay issue.” That’s
kinda interesting. Or how ‘bout,
“Millionaires in the cabinet:
Clinton 9, Reagan7, Bush6.” How
about that? In an effort to make his
cabinet look more like America,
Bill Clinton has included nine mil-
lionaires (or, as they prefer to be
called, the “economically unchal-
lenged”’). Maybe just one more
headline, OK? “Challenge issued
to Clinton, blacks: Group wants
promises kept, community to help
itself.”

Seems President Clinton made

to be fulfilled. Maybe. Not.
Folks, the man promised todo
everything for everybody and
throw in a billion dollars to boot.
Sure, every voting minority group

-_(as the'gay rights activists are how
_ finding out). ‘Course, if you’re a

Haitian, don’t hasten to that leaky
boat right away—there’s a cordon
around the island to keep ya’ ll folks
from settin’ sail. Nothin’ personal,
just that it would take five or six
years for ya’ll to be able to pull a
votin’ lever (which is just too late
for “One Term” Willey). Stay
home, sit back, and enjoy the
American foreign policy that can-
didate Clinton labeled “cruel.”
Remember that little sign in
Clinton’s office, “The economy,
stupid!” Whatever happened to
that, do you think? Was President
Clinton just too busy worrying
about Fleetwood Mac to dance with
the date what brung him? The
Birks wonder. We agree with the

promise, this is your
chicken come home to roost.

Despite an otherwise success-
ful career in which the nuclear
threat was effectively diminished
and freedom restored in peace-lov-
ing Kuwait, youze guys picked on
the man for one policy shift he
made two and a half years after the
fact. Clinton backpedals two-
weeks after the election, and its
“just” a campaign promise. Well,
we’re here to tell you . . . the
“breakable campaign
committment” is gone forever.
We're going to hold the Demo-
cratically controlled Executiveand
Congressional branches toas strict
an accounting as ya'll held the
Republicans. It’s payback time,
boys and girls.

And by the way, if you’re a
taxpayer, or a Haitian, or a minor-
ity, ora plurality, or even a Repub-
lican . . . DON’T LET BILL
CLINTON KISS YOU! The kiss
traditionally precedes the screw.

I Often Shouted Nyah! Nyah!

beer at each other, make insightful
comments like: Hey Coach!
Tommy has his shirton backwards!
(followed by tumultuous six year
old laughter), and gesticulate
wildly when the cheerleaders pull
the lint off their sweaters. At
Davidson, the cheerleaders take
off their sweaters and people still
don’tnotice thecheerleaders. (Edi-
tors note-He’s kidding.) And they
even give cheers like these:
CHEERLEADERS: One,
we are the Wildcats. Two, a little
bit louder now. Three, we stillcan’t
hear you. Four, MORE! MORE!

MORE! Wait... Hello?!! Is gigone.

conscious?

I didn’t think we fans were
that bad, but a conversation I had
with one of the cheerleaders the
other day, gave me a new perspec-
tive on the non support matter:

CHEERLEADER: Do you
know what’s the hardest thing for
a cheerleader?

ME: The double flip somer-
sault 360° supra-gymnastic gotta
hurt split?

CHEERLEADER: No. To go
out and cheer and people don’t
respond.

ME: Oh.

Look, the cheerleaders work
hard and so do the athletes, so the
least we can do is cheer like the
nutty, frenzied, irrational, child-
ish, twisted, Biology/History ma-
jors we all are. I leave you with a

quote from the same cheerleader:
“People cheer only when the good
plays happen. Maybe if people
cheered some more in general,
more good plays would happen.”
Maybe so. At least we could try.

And to Eddie Yardumian:

WE’RE NUMBER ONE!
WE’RE NUMBER ONE!

NYAH! NYAH! NYAH!
NYAH!: NYAH!

C ommunity Should be
Based on Individuals

sensitivity training are not going to
make Davidson a better place. Itis
silly to sit down and tell someone
he must be sensitive to a particular
black student because the student
is black. What is desirable is to be
respectful of that black student
because he is an individual person
to be judged on his personal worth.
Davidson is defined by the charac-
ter of its student body. In Ballard’s
case, one bigot screwed: up.
Davidson is not an elitist institu-
tion, it is an exclusive one.

On an individual level, no-
body can ask for anything except
to be judged, as Martin Luther King
said, “by the content of their char-
acter, not the color of their skin.”

You don’tpick your friends on any

~ quota system. You hang out with

the people you genuinely like. You
eam grades based on your perfor-
mance in the courses. The fraterni-
ties don’t have achart saying what
groups must be represented in their
pledge class. It is all done natu-

rally. It all just happens. It is
natural to be color blind.
I like to learn about my ances-

tors in Germany. You may enjoy
learning about your ancestors in
Ireland or Africa. It doesn’t mat-
ter. When we’re in class, we are
Davidson College students and
individuals, not Africans, Irish, or
Germans. And student is a non-
judgemental word. I wonder why
there were no students in the cabi-
net.

Eating Together is
Really, Really Nice

to meals, not because of the food,
but because they are her one op-
portunity to see all of her friends,

no matter what their sex or social
affiliation, Her experience sounds

rather. appealing when. compared
~ tothe eating house member's here.
No matter how much you may like
your little organization, seeing the

same faces every time you go eat
can become monotonous.
Granted, under an alternative
system house unity might suffer,
but then again, people might start
toregard house meetings and other
functions as more important occa-
sions because they would differ so

much from the daily experience of |

eating that we experience now.
Men’s and women’s groups might
begin to attract only those who
were truly committed to their
houses because of the extra time
they might require of them. Cam-
pus unity would climb dramati-

cally as well (now that required

‘chapel has been abolished, there is
little left that Brings us all together
for any sirigtilar purpose).
Because of its size, Davidson
has an advantage over larger
schools in that it could conceiv-
ably take on the task of feeding all

’ of us. It just might be wise to make

them do it.

For me and my class it is far
too late to change what may be a
flawed system, but opportunities
perhaps remain for the rest of you.

Deidra’s Response

Continued from page 8

The point is that we have to
realize that people from different
races have the same feelings and
abilities as we do. We even put our
pants on the same way, one leg at
a time. You shouldn’t be inter-

ested in someone from a different
race just because you think they’d
be good in bed, or you’d get re-
spect from your boys because she’s
on your arm. It’s notall about that.
However, if there is an interracial
couple who is serious about their
relationship, they should be sup-
ported and not shunned.
