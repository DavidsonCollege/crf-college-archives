NEW BORDER
PLACED UPON
ANNIVERSARY
GIFT PLATES

Alumni Office Will Accept
Loss on First Twenty-Five:
Dozen Plates

FUTURE PRICE HIGHER

Oldest Alumnus of Davidson
Purchases One Dozen

Because of the type of border se-
cured on the Centennial Plates, the
Wednwood Company recently notified
the Alumni Office that these plates
would cost more than was originally
announced. However, the Alumni Of-
fice will take the Joss on the first
twenty-live dozen that have been or-
dered, and sell them for the price
that was originally quoted at $15 per
dozen, $8 per half dozen, and $1.50
each,

Aiter the original order has been
sold. it will be necessary .to raise
the price on af! others sold to SIS
per dozen. The difference in the price
of these plates-is caused By the type
of border’_ The price that was first
quoted was for plates with a printed
border, while those plates which have
been secured have a raised border.

To. date, 17 dozen of these plates
have been sold of the original order
of 25 dozen. This only leaves eight
dozen to be sold at the originat price.
The blue plates ‘have been the most
popular of afl the colors. There have
been more ot these sold. than ‘of the
other three colors, Rose, Pink, Green
and Mulberry put together.

Davidson's oldest alumnus, Dr, S.
IT. Bell, 1870, of Wrightsville, Pa.,
has ordered one dozen of these
plates. e

The Centennial Plates” are being
made for Davidson by Josiah Wedg-
wool and Sons of Etruria, England.

“LIMIT COURTS”
CRY STUDENTS

Collegiate Press Requests Con-
gress to Limit Supreme

Court’s Power e

(By slssociated Collegiate Press)
Washington, D.C. (ACP)—
The Power of the United

States Supreme Court to in-?-

validate legislation has reached
socially damaging proportions,
in’ the opinion of Amcrican
college students, and should be
curbed} without delay.

Reévision of the constitition so as
to check the power of the high
court is favored by a majority of
students, according to an Associated
Collegiate Press sarvey just com-
pleted.

Remedies ranging from increus-
ing the number of Supreme Court
justices by maming liberal: ap-
pointees known to have kept pace
with the times to giving Congress,
the power to ,reinstate legislation
thrown out, by the court are sug:

gested by college leaders. -
Strongly urging revision, The
Ohio State Lantern commends a
state Jaw-maker :
“Usually conservative, ‘safe and
sound, Senator Vie Ronahey an-
nounced i: Washington that he

a revision of the Constitu-
imn—hetause he believes it has not
kept -pase with the times. A re-
vision is necessary, he pointed-out.
‘to provide additional guarantees
of health, safety and security for
the people.’

favors

“We believe that i is a stgnifi-
cant statement and probably holds
significant results. Jt is indeed
heartening to note that Senator
Donahey, who is usually classed in
the conservative bloc in Congress,

I has finally recognized the need for

Change. His statement indicates
quite clearly a trend away from
the traditionally-held belief that the
Constitution is-a—sacred-docmnuen
one which must not be changed
lest we gain the wrath of the vods.

“There, is even a new and more
hberal attitude growing among the
general public toward  constitu-
tional change. This is as it ishould
be. The ironical fact is that for
too long most of us have clung to
the ime-worn theory that to
change the Constitution is plain
heresy.”

Meanwhile, Duquesne University
students, in respotise to a ques-
tionnaire, voted 56 per cent in fa-
vor of curbing the power of the
Supreme Court. It is evident that
the interest of students is steadily
swinging to matters of national
concern.

Map To Indicate

Program Range

Professor Pfohl announced to the
band fast week that a large map of
the United States would be made, and
on it would be designated every part
of the country hearing the Davidson
program.

Lhis map will be placed in the ban-
quet hall. A butietin board will also
be placed there on which will be
placed letters commenting on the Dav-
idson radio program. ,

Mr. Pfoht said he was particularly
anxious to hear from all points hear-
ing the -Columbia chain program on
Wednesday evening, and asks that any
student receiving comment on the
program place a slip under his door

‘All “fan” letters for the past three
years have been kept on file, and
will now be used in working out this
map. Among the places having heard
the program are England and Tor-
ento, Canada.

The Davidson College Li-

and, in many ways, unique his-
tory in the course of its growth
from a few. scattered volumes
to the organized unit which it
is today.

Its Beginning

When the sparse collection of
hooks owned by the College was
first catalogued in IS41. it was
found’ to inelude some 231 volumes,
most of which had been presented
to the College. At that time, the
literary societics ad their own li-
braries which were larger, strange
ta say, than the College library

Younger Boys Hold
Meeting On Friday

The weekly meeting of a group of
boys between the ages of nine and
fifteen was-held Friday night, Feb-
tuary the seventh, under the tute-
lage of Cage Brewer and Fred
Stair.

This group-is-connected-with the
Boy Scout work’in the Y. M. CA.
for the purpose of teaching the
younger boys to be good citizens
by, inculeating the principles of the
Scout oath and laws,

At this mecting, Cage- Brewer
spoke on the ioundation of scout-
ing bys Sir Maden Powell in the
United States on February 8, 1910
in New York City. The entire week
up to that time was being dedicated
to the founder, by scouts through-
out; the  cntire” nation. Brewer
spoke of the Silver Buffalo award
that the founder had set up May

1920, tor any person who com-
mitted some heroic deed. Ile men-
tioned one boy, who with only one
leg. had jumped into the water and
had saved a little girl from drown-
ing. This and many other cases
interested the boys very -much,

After this short talk, Brewer and
Stair led the boys in some organ-
ized games, as bs the usual custom,
and while doing so, they fell vic-
tims of a “frame up,” and soon had
a big snowball fight on their hands.
