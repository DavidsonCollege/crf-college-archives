Stopping An Emotional Time Bomb

I write the following state-
ment to reveal a bit of my-
self, to make myself ‘a bit
more transparent to those
around me, and to point to a
problem which I think is the
most serious problem David
son has.

‘During my junior year in
high school I began to feel
a great deal of anxiety, de-

‘pression and confusion about

myself and my relations with
others.

I lacked motivation to
work in school, and at night
I went to my room question-
ing all that I ever believed

or ever did. I lacked a fee}-
ing of self-esteem, and I felt
an. intense ‘lack of security
about myself.

I wandered through that
junior year mostly in mis
ery. I felt estranged,’ alien-
ated, and misunderstood. I
felt that I could not be hon-
est with others and they
could not be honest with me.

I had enough money the fol-
lowing summer to go to a
friend, who is a clinical psy-
chologist, for weekly — ses-
sions over a period of about
two months. In these ses
sions we very honestly and

forthrightly discussed me,

I had a chance (perhaps
one of the greatest chances
of my life) to look at myself
and others from a new per-
spective.

I had a friend, the
apist,

ther-
who was understand-
ing and helpful and who was
willing to keep all that we
discussed confidential. He of-
fered me his willlingness to
listen and to hear what I
said.

.During the course of our
sessions I got to know him,
too. I had a chance to learn
to hear honest communica
tion from him about himself
and his own difficulties, and
we became good friends.

There is .a great deal of
pain in trying to be honest
with yourself and in trying.
to communicate that honesty
to others.

You have to of ven
ture into an honest relation
ship trusting another person

sort

to be careful in dealing with.

the parts of your life which
you show him.

You have to assume the
responsibility, too, of becom-
ing a person he can trust as

‘he tells you about himself.

That is a real challenge, and
and it is a very painful proc-
ess. But is, for me, the most
rewarding experience I can
have. :

It is certain that Davidson
students are not immune to
the problems of alienation
and loneliness. Problems ex-
ist here in great abundance.

We are on an isolated cam
pus in a rapidly changing
world. This is a_ single-sex
campus with. little access to
continuing exposure to wom-
en.

We face a war which is so
far away and yet so close to
every student here. In re-
cent years a variety of drugs

Black Poetry And Jazz

Make Poor Com

A REVIEW

By FRANK SOOS

Contrary to the advertise
ments for T. J. Reddy and
Expressions ’70 which read
“black poetry set to music,”
Wednesday night’s perform-
ance was more black poetry
and music thrown together.

Featured were“Reddy and
Grady Seigle, ‘band leader
and composer. Reddy cur-
rently writes for the Char-
lotte Observer and edits the

Charlotte arts magazine
Aim. His poetry has been
published in Southern Poe-
try Review, the Red Clay
Reader and other literary
magazines.

The band, playing) some
of Seigle’s compositions, per-
formed a breed of jazz that
was closely akin, at its best
moments, to the sound of
Santana, complete with con-
ga drums. At ‘times, how-
ever, the musicians were
not. playing together and

some key solos were playe
poorly.

Jazz as played by the Ex-
pressions ’70 is’ a cool, melo-
dic, rhythmic strain of mu
SiGe Unfortunately, the
smooth sound and the vio,
lent lyrics of Reddy's poetry
clashed and limited the ef-
fects of either.

Reddy began by reading
several of his own works
and then went into works by
other black poets and poet-
esses. His reading was poor
and he tended! to stumble
often over his own _ lyrics
which were far too wordy

and fast moving to catch the |

audience’s attention.

“Jazz, one of his best
poems, paints a picture of
the black musician. How-
ever, he drops back on the
old theme-of the supression

of the black man, out of
keeping with the theme of
the poem.

The bursts of poetry were
short and then gone before
the audience could get into

b

e ti

the theme. Then more mnousic
which may or may not have
been in any way related to
the poetry.
three poems on black wo-
manhood were followed by
“The Look of Love.’

Another aspect of the
music/reading was the air
of the entertainer that Reddy
assumed throughout. — Intro-
ductions were handled with
showmanship. The, lighting
didn’t add to the actual
reading either. When .em-
phasis is on the spoken word,
a pink light on the speaker
must somehow affect his
message,

Good points from Reddy’s
appearance seem to have
been that the band was, on
the whole, enjoyable, even
though its presence was sup-
erfluous to the poetry. The
selections from. other poets
were also excellent even
though the reading, lighting,

and music all contributed to

minimizing their effective-
ness.

The Chronicle of Higher Education has reported
that the National Student Association (NSA), of which
Davidson, College is a member, has fallen deeply in
debt. The NSA owes almost $100,000 on a loan taken

last year to meet old debts.

According to Vice President Donald, Shali, many
of its programs have been cut back and all are under:
staffed. However, Shall expressed hope’ that the de-
ficit might be reducd as loan payments become small-
er and as money comes in from NSA services, includ-

ing a recognized book club.

cock, the student newspaper, has stated.

Dickinson College Feels Economic Pinch

_ _ The Dickinson Adl-College Committee on Institu-
tional Priorities and Resources recommended to the
president of the college the following (1) a 45 dollar
raise in tuition, (2) that salary increments be held
across the board, (3) the elimination of several posi-
tions in some departments and (4) the limitations of
the number of.personnel in other departments.
Also, according to the Dickinsonian, federal work-
study funds will run out April 15. Next year’s funds
will have to be used to meet the deficit. It is reported
that the end of funds will cause some understaffing
in the various departments and in the Food Service.
