Little Spee McConnell’s weekly bed-
time story:

One upon a time there was a girl, she
was the only daughter of the village dog-
catcher. One day a slick city fellow
came in town, and took her to dinner at
a cafe. While there, he committed a ter-
rible he fed the dog-catcher’s
daughter on raw meat. She immediately
became sick—had terrible attack of
hydrophobia. The next day she died.
The city fellow should have fed her on
liver—for raw meat makes dog-people
wild.

Collegiate Definitions

Freshmen are small bodies of humanity
entirely surrounded by ignorance.

Sophomores are slight swellings, jut-
ting into seas of sophistication,

Juniors are beings, not large enough to
obtain seniority, bounded on two. sides
by fire-water, on one side by U-Drive-
Ems and on the other side by a Dum-
hell.

Co-eds are the archipelogos of college

insignificant bodies, known as the re
sult of strange discoveries by men.

The Faculty—but why go on,

Father—‘How are you getting on in
school now?”
Young Son—‘Fine. We're learning
words of four cylinders now.”
