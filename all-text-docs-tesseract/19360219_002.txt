MORE UNCLAIMED DAVIDSON GEN-
TLEMEN: Those who cough unnecessarily
during the chapel service ia an apparent effort
to annoy the speaker.

x * *€ *

Cheating rings scem to be contagious, or
are they ORGANIZED FOR publicity pur-

poses. One was revealed at the University of
South Carolina last week.

‘Know the Faculty.. .

For quite a long while a Davidson student
would almost be zeeused of heresy if he should
be seen stopping by a professor's office for
an informal chat with him or if one of his
fellows saw the two walking across the cam-
_pus together.

Thankfully we are able to say that this
condition no longer exists in its former unani-
mous way. However, there is stilla definitely
broad and deep cavern between the students
of Davidson College and its faculty. A gap
that both groups should conscientiously strive
to make smaller, more garticilarly the stu-
dents because it is very largely due to their
indifference and—lack of appreciatien—for a
wholesome friendly relationship with their in-
structors that this inexcusable situation has
come about.

Professors are scen in the classrooms, where
they have little time to do more than the re-
quired amount of work on fact and theory,
which taken alone as a Basis for judgment,
would create an extremely unfair opinion of
the sort of person a professor might be like.
Therefore, if the students could at some va-
cant times have a few out-of-the classroom
sessions with his “narrow-minded, bull—
headed prof” he would, almost without ex-
ception, assume an entirely different and more
understanding opinion of his classroom
master.

It would be very difficult for an instructor
with a class of fifty men to find out exactly
what sort of person “Johnnie Knownothing”
is when he sits peacefully on the third row and
never opens his mouth exeept to answer
“here” when his name is called down the al-
phabetical line. So, even in the so called “small
college,"as we. proudly claim Davidson is,
and hope will be for many years to comme, it
is necessary for the student to make some
special effort along that line if he wants to
really know the professors and have them
know him.

The question will undoubtedly arise, as it
has many times before; “what good will it do

you to know the members of the faculty ?”
*

and unfortunately this interrogation implies
the unthoughtiul attitude of too many Dav-
idson men.

To answer it most effectively we quote
jrom one whe mot many years ago dwelt with
in the same walts, which now shelter us, and
has been taught, so he asserts, a great deal

trom the mest impressionable of all teachers. |,

“bitter experience, *
Numerous other alumni of Davidson have

expressed similar opinions on this subject, but | ©

this one gives it in the clearest and most con-
cise way of any.

“Paramount among the numerous advan-
tages one can gain from an intimate associa-
tion with dhe professors at Davidson are two
things whieh | was never either wise enough
or courageous enough to enjoy. The first is
that if vou know your professor and he knows

men of Davidson to know

days."

Let's get out of this rut we are in at Dav-
idson aad learn to know our faculty. They
are human the same as any of us, and when
we fail to seize the opportunity of friendly
association with them we are missing some-
thing of inestimable value.

Ministry For Magnitude...

Sunday night Dr, Cunningham used “The
Ministry of Solitude” as the theme for his un-
usually fine address, and it occurred to me
that this could also be called The Ministry
ior Magnitude. It is a time when we can get
off to ourselves and meditate upon the things
which make for greatness and strength of
character.

We hear it preached about us every day
that the big trouble in society today is the
lack of sane logical thought. This may be
quite true im some respects, but it would be
hard to deny that even American youth docs
a great amount of collective reasoning, the
sort of reasoning that evolves about the ideas
of others, and either improves or destroys the
blue prints of those few creative individual
thinkers. who should be actually tonesome
with the small amount of company they have
in this country.

From Dr. Cunningham's message, therefore,
I think we should be made more sensitive to
the real need, for uninfluenced thought, which
isn’t wrong ititsclf, but it doesn’t give to us
the magnitude\ that original individual crea-
tions do, when "xorked out in quiet solitude.

“The greatest love-letter ever written” is in
a collection at Haverford. John Keats wrote it,
a century ago, to Fanny Brawne.

Abolition of states and divisicns of the
country into regions, their boundaries dictated
by economy and bv cultures and traditions,
was suggested by Dr. J. W. Manning, of the
University of Kentucky.

POLITICAL SUBTERFUGE

The most effective and bewilder-
ing instrument for the furtherance
of autocratic goyernment, particu-
larly useful in colleges and uni-
versities, is the Committee Idea.
One can argue with a man, but a
decision by a Committee. (sic!)
leaves one confused with a fecling
of hopelessness. The hypocritical
impression it leaves is reminder of
franker Louis NIV: “L'etat, C'est
moi!" While the mind is in that

track: from observation and verbal
comparison
there is a more repressed and bitter

and correspondence,
feeling of the Student Body in gen-
toward the administration in

personnel of which we know., The
goal of the rising student body ad-
ministration should be to go to the
root of.the problem and eradicate a
condition which bodes no good for
Davidson. "

A freshman is a guy who had bet-
ter not let the grass grow under
his feet. A writer is a more or less
ornery creature who spends half of
his life getting out of sorts with
the world and the other half try,
ing to get the world in sorts with
him. A columnist is a queer sort
of a. guy who writes like things
have happened when they haven't.

THE LOVELIFE OF

In an investigation of the goings-
on of our local and nearby brethren,
we find that. Karl Caldwell makes it
a High Point to visit a Miss Brown,
tlidt Virgil Ritchie goes around
singing popular Ballards, that Paul
Hudson is interested in a Miss Tay-
lor and that Owen Davidson, Dick
Melchor and Theodore Mack are
members of that great tribe of rep-
tilians indigenous to certain mon-
ocotyledonous planta. As for our
friend Ed Mack, we have not yet
gotten the dope but suppose that
it Macks no difference. A more in-
tensive and more local investiga-
tion may he expected next week.

ADDRESS
Two Y. M. C. A. YOUTHS

Benfield and Walker Sent As
Y. M. C. A. Deputation

—-— To Charlotte
3iH Benfield and John M.
Walker spoke to two boys

groups at the Charlotte Y. M.
. A.. Sunday afternoon, Feb-
ruary 16, as a “Y” deputation
from Davidson.

Regular mectings, led by repre-
sentatives of the college “Y,”" have
}been held for several months. Ben-
field met with a group of boys of
grammar school age, and Walker
addressed the high school group.

The subject of Walker's discus-
sion was “What it means. to be a
Christian.” In recommending the
Christian life as one which any
red-blooded fellow could lead, -
Walker spoke of the difference in
character between Jesus and his
proud Roman contemporaries and
stated that their mighty battles
counted for very little today, in
comparison with the humane works
of Christ. -

Benfield developed the theme of
the “Treasure of Heaven” in his
talk to the younger boys, saying
that is neglected at present in favor
of worldly rewards.

ANNUAL MEETING

(Continued from Page 1) .
cula activities, athletics and music
were discussed. Dr. Lingle stated
before the mecting had taken place,
“something may be done about a
director of physical education.” He
also referred to music as a “great
cultural part of the curriculum.”
Following this, the report made
clear the need for library adjust-
ments, due to the small size of the
building and the growing number
of books that must be housed.

Tenth in the report, President
Lingle recommended that three
joint committees be appointed from
the faculty and the trustees.for the
purpose of arranging and planning
an appropriate Centennial for Dav-
idson College.

Concluding the report, eighteen
recommendations were presented to
the trustees for their approval or
rejection. These mainly goncerned
the re-election of certain associate
professors and members of the
staff. Several men were also con-
sidered for honorary degrees to be
presented at commencement, There

‘| were three nominations for the de-

gree of Doctor of Divinity, and
three for other degrees,

In this concluding section of the
report, the immediate needs of the
College in the way of buildings
were discussed. A need was ex-
Dressed for the following: an in-
firmary, library. field house, church,
social center, science building, an-
other dormitory, and an addition to
the stadium. For this building pro-
gram, about $815,000 would be
needed according to President
Lingle.

NO EPIDEMIC

(Continued from Page 1)

the epidemic progresses it is liable
to become more severe in character
and we recommend.that all students
guard against infections as far as
possible. Crowding closely together
in rooms poorly ventilated is the
most common cause. Anyone with
a cough and a slight fever-is in the
infectious stage.

“We have handled many severe
epidemics since 1918 and at present
are not unduly alarmed, for the
cases we have now are mostly of
a mild form. All cases however
should have proper care and treat-
ment, for if taken in hand early
and treated properly there is tittle
danger or loss of time.”
