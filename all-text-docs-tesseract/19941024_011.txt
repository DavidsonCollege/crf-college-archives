Artist Series features California dance troupe ODC

By Dave Williard

When it comes to writing re-
views on Artist Series events, about
all I can say is that if you missed it,
you missed out! According to my
sources, last Saturday’s perfor-
mance by ODC/Dance San Fran-
cisco artistically outdid Airband
by a wide margin. So, while many
of the culturally impaired were
putting down 8-balls, one of the
nation’s foremost dance troupes
returned to Love Auditorium for a
stunning presentation of ballet,
social dance, and athleticism.

The performance consisted of

four separate dance pieces. The’

show centered thematically on
women’s issues; the last dance,

entitled “Dirt,” was an excerpt from
ODC’ strilogy, “Western Women.”
This piece chronicles women’s
social progress since the nineteenth
century and includes a striking
musical piece by Bobby
McFerrin’s vocal group SoVoSo.

ODC founder and artistic di-
rector Brenda Way incorporates a
fusion style that emphasizes
athleticism, the look of “real
people” dancing. Because her in-
terestin physical virtuosity requires
a wide range of dance styles, many
dancers in ODC are older than in
other companies. While most
members of the troupe have for-
mal ballet training, they augment
this form with modern jazz styles

as well. The group’s graceful
physicality is simply breathtaking,
especially in the pieces “River”

“and “John Somebody.”

ODC’ shighly symbolic works
are a bit enigmatic, but Way is not

concerned that audiences will miss

her message. For her, the beauty of
the dance comes before all else.
“People can relax and not have to
understand thé story,” she said.
“Whatever you get is‘the story.”

And the story I get is that
anyone would be a fool to miss out
on the Artist Series. The next
Series performance will be on De-
cember 3rd, with jazz trumpeter
Terence Blanchard. Go and ex-
pand your mind.

How many of us complain
about the walk from down the
hill, the gruelling journey toclass,
demoralizing simply through the
sheer elevation of the hill itself.
And who doesn’ thave the right to
complain? It’s a good quarter-
mile we’ re talking about. Ah, but
we should feel small.

On Sunday, October 23 at 9
a.m., Lillian Roe ‘95, Dr. Sally
McMillen, and Dr. Susan Rob-
erts will compete in the 26th Ma-
rine Corps Marathon in Wash-
ington, D.C.

Preparation for a race such
as this is no small matter.

‘McMillen, a member of the his-
tory department and atwenty year
veteran of running, has been train-
ing for the race since June of this
year. A little wary about under-
taking such a monumental task
alone, she asked Roberts of the
political science department to
join her, and they have been train-
ing ever since. An average work-
out consists of a long run of 19 or
20 miles.

Lillian Roe’s workouts are
noless demanding. Training since
August, she runs 75 miles a week,
broken down into 12 to 13 miles
a day plus a long run of about 22
miles on the weekend. On top of
this, she tries to hold a steady
seven to eight minute pace per
mile.

Roe says, “I think most
people think I’mcrazy.” She sees
a marathon as the “ultimate chal-
lenge,” something that requires
grave commitment and will-
power. McMillen says: “I’ve
always loved to shoot for big
goals.”

Never having taken on a dis-
tance this long, the contestants
are excited to race. All will be
joined by support groups for the
last five miles, when friends and
family run alongside to urge the
runners on and insure a safe fin-

ish.
