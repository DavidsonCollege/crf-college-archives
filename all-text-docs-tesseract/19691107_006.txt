popularity?

I respectfully maintain that

the Commission has made
no case whatsoever for its
recommendation. that ‘‘fra-

ternities be allowed to pledge”

and initiate students from
(only) the three upper clas-
ses.”

This was simply, yet un-
necessarily, borrowed from
earlier reports, with the new
suggestions that the College
Uuion program would be
more successful through the
end of school ‘if in effect,
freshmen were continuously
prohibited from the competi-
tive attraction of fraternity
membership.

The older argument of the

early 1960's was that deferred
membership would result in
(a) fairer appraisal of the
rushees,
to

personal merits of
and (b) more invitations
join, but (c) a greater inci-
dence of enlightened fresh- *
nen rejecting fraternities.
What happened. so far was
that (a) prolonged appraisal
intensified the pain of not
receiving a bid, (b) more
were indeed invited to join
and (c) a greater percent-
age of enlightened freshmen
accepted fraternities.

Scratch one theory, and
work up another! Apparent-
ly “reform” fraternities
is fo be acceptablé only if
it weakens and destroys them.

The-same sort of appraisal
was expressed about th®,new
“exténded rush’’ program.
Heralded earlier as a method
of increasing opportunity for
fraternity membership, we
are now to reject it because
it has worked too well!

vidson College is to take vis

for the College to use its re-
sources to help meet the
educational needs of the lo-

mission believes that if
financial support is avail-
able, this proposal should be
tried.

tions of Davidson students at
the invitation of the College
for so many years.

If we are to emulate the

liams and Amherst Colleges,
has been suggested; at
let's avoid their tech-
niques of subverting the fra-
ternity system into impo-
tence. We don't need to emu-
late that part of the Williams
reputation,

Tt was for this reason that
I had offered a motion in the
31st meeting of the Commis-
sion that it include the fol-
lowing resolution in its  re-
port: ‘‘The Commission rec-
omends that copies of this
report be sent to, the national
fraternities with chapters on

an invitation that they con-
vene to discuss the content

of the report, its consequen-

|

ces, and-their future role at
Davidson College.”

This was tabled indefinite
ly, so I offer it as a major
recommendation of the Min
ority Report. It may be the
answer to a sticky problem
with our alumni. If all these
fraternity leaders
brought to Davidson as our
guests, and thanked for their

eighty per cent of the re-
plies indicated that the col-
lege either should effect the
transition, or will have to in

compete  success-

fully with other colleges in

the future.

The response was of no
great surprise, nor was the
faculty response,- in Which
three-fourths of' the re
sponses indicated a desire
for coeducation.

The older alumni were the
most opposed, while the
younger alumni's. sentiments
were slightly in favor of co-

as an_all-

dents without the presence
of women, the argument
that all-male colleges are
still needed, and the finan
cial obstacles involved.

One of the questions ad
dressed to the alumni and
faculty concerned the finan-
cial feasibility of coeduca-
tion, to which nearly one
half of the alumni indicated
that it was not feasible,
while nearly two-thirds of
the faculty’ deemed benefits

Admissions

The students believed that
having women on the David-
son campus would have a
positive effect on the num-
ber and quality of appli-
cants, as did the faculty.
71 per cent of the present
freshnwen would advise an
academically qualified
younger brother to come to

David- *

Davidson if accepted, while
only 41 per cent of the’ pre-
sent senior class would give
the same positive advice.
The alumni indicated that
having a coeducational stu-

Academic Community

Concerning the
realm, a large majority of
students responding did not
feel that the presence of wo-
men in classes would dis
tract them or inhibit them,
and at the same time reject
the notion that coeds would
cause them to increase their
classroom preparation and
participation.

The faculty disagreed with
the students on the latter
point; they felt that the
classroom discussion quali-
ty would be increased if wo-
men were present. Once
again from the _ faculty
standpoint, the faculty could
no significant changes
necessary in their present
teaching methods.

Social Life

In dealing with the social
life, several questions were
utilized. A majority of the
students regard the present
social life either as ‘“‘toler-
able” or as detracting from
education. In response to
this merely “‘tolerable’’ at-
mosphere, we found that
just over a third of the stu-
dents migrate from the cam-
pus three to five out of every
ten weekends.

The students also indicat-
ed that Davidson encourages
unrealistic attitudes toward

patterns at coeducational

as those at all-male and all-

and the women tend to leave
