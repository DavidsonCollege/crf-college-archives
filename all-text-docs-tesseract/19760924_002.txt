N.C. Arts Residency program.

Johnson, who is currently a move-
ment specialist with the Artists in the
Schools program, studied modern
dance in New York City for ten years
at the Henry Sreet Playhouse; he also
performed with the Niholai Dance
Theatre and the Murray Lewis Dance
Theatre from 1963-1971. .

New York Time's arts reviewer Don
McDonagh said that “...Johnson’s
penchant for humor is a ray of light in
the dreary landscape of much concert
dance.” a

Says Steve Peeples, Co-Curricular
Vice President, ‘Johnson particularly
well-known for his ability to com-
municate with people who have little
or no familiarity with modern dance
and for his nationwide reputation for
gregariousness, friendliness, and
openness to the public.”

Johnson's first appearance will be

Thursday at 10:00 am in Chambers
Banquet Hall, where, after informal
conversation during Coffee and
Cokes. he will give a demonstration of
his art. utilizing members of the
audience. At 10:00 am on Friday he
will be in the Conversation Pit and at
1:15 pm he will perform at Davidson
Elementary School. At 8:00 pm
Johnson will be in concert in Love
Auditorium: admission free to. stu-
dents and staff with ID and two

Saturday at 2:30 pm Johnson will
hold a master class for modern dance
in Love Auditorium.

Johnson is Davidson’s first artist
funded by the residency program. The
National Endowment for the Arts
along with the North Carolina Arts
Council grants funds to schools to
help support the arts.

An artist in this program resides on
college campuses for two to five days

personal contact with the students.

The Union expects to continue the
residency program .to offer musical
groups and mime groups to the
Davidson community.
