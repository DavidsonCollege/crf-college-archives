came to a frustrating halt against UNC Greensboro last

weekend. The Wildcats
were swept by UNGG, 5-1,
12-11, and 3-2.

Davidson constantly
showed its perseverance and
determination, but they
came up just short in their
efforts. The losses drop
Davidson to 16-13 overall
and 8-7 in conference play.

Davidson suffered
from an inability to produce
offensively against UNCG
pitcher Ryan Gordon in the

first game. He shut down the potent Wildcat offense,
limiting them to just one unearned run. Davidson starter
Ryan Stroker had some control problems, allowing four

walks that led to four runs.

In the second game, UNCG gave Davidson a little
taste of its own medicine, jumping on them early in the
game. After three innings, the Wildcats faced an 11-0
deficit, but they showed their character by refusing to go
quietly. As the pitching staff held Greensboro to only one
more run, Davidson chipped away at the lead.

The Wildcats had clawed their way back into the
game when darkness forced the contest to be shortened to
eight innings. Davidson, down by one in the eighth, had

runners on first and third but they failed to capitalize.
Greensboro pitched two strikeouts and grabbed a
pop-up to escape with a 12-11 victory.

The Wildcats were hungry for redemption Sun-
day going into the third and final game of the series,
but they suffered an huge loss before the first pitch.

Senior co-captain and four-year starter at shorstop
Ben Brown went down with a fractured leg while
warming up for the game. Ben, a vital part of the
Wildcat lineup who has not missed a start in four
years, will be out for four to six weeks. The loss is
especially unfortunate given that Ben was very close

to breaking school records for at-bats, hits, and steals. _

Freshman D.J. Dailey replaced Ben in the lineup
and had two hits in his first collegiate start. The
contest would be a thriller, with Wes Self and Mark
Wells combining to limit the powerful Greensboro
offense to two runs in the first nine innings. Jeremiah
Parvin was the focal point of this game, however,
blasting a two-run shot that tied the game and sent it
in to extra innings, where Parvin would take the hill
and attempt to stop UNCG.

The Wildcats again came up just short, a victim
of the same bad luck that had started the day. Clutch
hits by Greensboro allowed the Spartans to take the
lead in the top of the 11th, 3-2. Matt Berry’s double
gave Davidson an opportunity to tie, but the Wildcats
failed to get the run home.

“We’re disappointed about the events of the
weekend, but we’re not going to let it get us down,”
senior co-captain Stewart Sloan said. “This team will
bounce back and continue what has been a great
season.”

Solid pitching has helped the Wildcats already record
more victories than they totaled the entire 1999 sea-

two non-conference opponents last week,
blowing out Columbia and Fairfield by a
combined score of 33-7. The Wildcats im-
proved their record to 16-10 and have already

surpassed their
win total from
last year.
Senior
co-captains
Ben Brown
and Stewart
Sloan led the
way against
Columbia,
each homering
in the 18-6
romp. For
Brown, it was

his first homerun of the year.

“T don’t hit a lot of homeruns,” said
Brown, “but I have to prove every now and
then that I do have the power.”

As they have done all season, the Wild-
cats scored early and pitched well to win. By
the third inning against Columbia, they hada

starting pitcher and contributed offensively
with two RBIs. The win against Columbia
was not just an exploitation of a weak team,
as Columbia went on to defeat UNCC that
same day.

Davidson followed the same winning
formula against Farifield the next day, need-
ing only one inning to jump out to a 7-0 lead.
Offensive highlights included Jeremiah
Parvin’s and Toby Crabtree’s RBI singles as
well as James Marino’s 2-run bomb. Brown
also added his second homer in two days.

However, the story of this game was
starting pitcher Wes Self. Self, known for
consistency: that keeps the Wildcats in the
game, absolutely dominated Fairfield’s
lineup. He set the tone with three K’s in the
first innning, following with two per inning
until he came out in the sixth.

The Wildcats eagerly awaited another
contest with Columbia on Thursday, but it
was cancelled due to rain. The cancellation
would give the team an extra day to prepare
for their weekend series with conference pow-
erhouse UNC Greensboro.

Schedule: The Saturday. doubleheader gets underway at
12:00 p.m. Sunday, the last game of the weekend’s series

starts at 1:00 p.m.

Cougars’ Record (as of.3/21/00): 11-12-1 overall, 5-3-1 SoCon (4th)

Glad he’s on our side: The Wildcats’ Tim Frend leads the Southern Conference in
number of hits—38: Three of the top five Southern Conference leaders in runs scored
ate Wildcats—Ben Brown (28), Tim Frend (27), and Ryan Stroker (28). Frend also ranks
second in the Southern Conference in RBIs with 29.
