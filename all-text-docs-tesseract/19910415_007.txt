Oh my gosh, would Ihave to get an
abortion? I had been raised on the
sex-only-after-marriage belief, and
abortion was taboo in my family.
My whole upbringing and sense of
self had been destroyed in one
night.

Atthe police station had inter-
view after interview, gave testi-
mony after testimony. I was still
on the drunk side, but was able to
talk o.k. Iwas beginning to hurtall
over, and I had one hell of a hang-
over. Ihad to tell complete strang-
ers what happened - had to de-
scribe what I remember my at-
tacker doing. I had to describe
sexualacts thatI hadnoclueabout.
Being a virgin I didn’t know what
was what. I had to identify my
attacker - and at that I drewa blank.
I couldn’t remember his name at
all, just a mnemonic device I had
created the first time I met him, to
remember his last name - which I
couldn’t remember either. So I
had to describe him.

After spending 4 hours in the
police station I wentto the hospital
to be treated. Before they would
admit me I had to call my parents
and get their permission since I
was aminor. That was the hardest
phone call I ever made. How do
you tell your parents that you had
been raped - while passed out?
Well, I told them and was admitted
into the hospital. I underwent test
after test. [hadanOB/GYN exam
done -.and for the females in the
audience you’ ll appreciate the fact
that they use no lubrication todo so
on rape victims so they don’t lose
evidence. Pain is not the word. I
had pubic hairs plucked from me, I
had my vagina combed, and many
other painful tests done. The hos-
pital experience was probably the
most traumatic part of the whole
rape. My whole body was being
invaded by people I didn’t know.
At the hospital the doctor game me
a prescription for an overdose of
birth-control pills soI would spon-
taneously abort, because they
thought I might be pregnant. Af-
terwards I went back to the police
station. My parents had arrived
and Ihad to give another testimony

to be recorded for a court case if I
decided to press charges. I also
had to identify my attacker. They
had found a guy that matched the
description of my attacker and
brought him in for questioning. He
was supposed to be confined in a
room with the door shut, but the
door was left open by mistake.
While going from one room to the
next with an officer we passed the
room with Chris in it, and I fainted.
Needless to say, that sufficed as
my identification.

I finally left for home at,7 that
night. The next few months for me
are kind of a blur. My whole
concept of who I was had been
altered forever. I had to begin the
process of rebuilding my Self. It
was a tedious and lengthy process
and lasted well past my senior year
- itis still going on. I had to learn
how to respect myself. I had to
relearn how to relate to guys. My
relationship with my boyfriend was
destroyed. He was a great support
after the rape, but all physical
contactended. I wouldn’t even let
him kiss me. I had to learn how to
trust guys again. The list goes on
and on,

What confused me was why
Chris raped me. All I did was talk
to him. Ihadn’t even danced with
him. I wasn’t dressed provoca-
tively. I was wearing a heavy

sweater, a turtleneck, and black

pants. I just couldn’t understand
why it happened. I decided to
press charges for many reasons.
First of all, I was already into it so
deep it would look like I was deny-
ing the attack was rape if 1 backed
out. It was labeled acquaintance
rape because I had talked to him
for about ten minutes and eventu-
ally could remember his name.
Unfortunately acquaintance rape
cases are notoriously difficult to
win. The rapists’s lawyer was ,
already trying toreduce the charges
to sexual assault - even to just
sexual harassment. My parents
both wanted me to go to court. So
did my boyfriend. The rape crisis
center also wanted me to. So we
gota lawyer and got a trial date. I
was really worried about the trial.
I was going to have to recount the
whole rape in front ofa jury. I’d
have to face my attacker. And I
knew it would drag on and on.

Ialso knew that my case would
be weak. I had been passed out
during most of the rape, and was
intoxicated when I was conscious.
Thad taken a shower and erased the
majority of the evidence. IF YOU
ARE RAPED NEVER TAKE A
SHOWER, NO MATTER HOW
DIRTY YOUFEEL, UNTIL YOU
HAVE THE PROPER TESTS
DONE. IT WILL MAKE YOUR
CASE EXTREMELY DIFFI-
CULT IF YOU SHOWER. And
Chris was a first time offender -
and not quite 18. He was still
considered a minor. Even if we
convicted him he would probably
only be sent toa juvenile detention
center for a year or so, then upon
turning 18 be only on probation. .
.and he probably would turn 18 by
the time of the trial. All he would
get out of the trial would be a
hatred of women, and I feared that
he would rape again, if not me,
some other woman.

So I decided to take a big risk,
against the warnings of both my
parents and lawyer. I made a con-
ditional offer to-Chris through his

lawyer that first he must take an .

AIDS test, and if that came up
negative I would give him analter-
native to the trial. His lawyer at
firstrefused - to take the test would
admitto the rape - but finally Chris
had the test and it came up nega-
tive. So I proposed that instead of
taking him to court 1 would meet
with him alone in a room - with
help within reach, and planned to
talk with him one on one to let him
know what the rape did to me- and
to find out why he didit. Ididn’tlet
him know whatI’d say, just.that he
had to stay there as longas! wanted.
At first he refused because of his
lawyer again, but finally he acqui-
esced and on June 11, 1990, 8
months after my rape, I met with
my rapistina small lawyer’s office
in New Jersey.

I was indeed taking a huge
risk. Ididn’t know if I’d be talking
toabrick wall ornot. I wouldn’tbe
able to force Chris to speak. All!
knew was that I wanted to know
why I was raped and to make sure
that it never happened again.

Sowe satin thatlittle office for
over three hours, and amazingly,
my attacker was responsive. I told
him howl felt, whatI wentthrough,

and asked him questions to try and
figure out why ithappened. I basi-
cally tried to psychoanalyze him
myself. It turned out that Chris had
wanted to take me up on my offer
from the start. He told me how
ashamed he felt, and to my aston-
ishment came out and _ said,
“Heather, I am so sorry.” Those
were the most important words I
have ever heard. And I knew he
meant it. He told what had hap-
pened after the rape, how he
dropped from #1 in his class to the

‘2nd from the bottom. He broke up

with his girlfriend. His father dis-
owned him. He withdrew all his
college applications. Andhe looks
a mess. And I knew, for some
reason, that I could believe him.
He was crying when he told me,
and was crying and acting in a way
that even the best of actors cannot
imitate. And oncoming out of that
room I knew that he would never
rape again. I consider rape a
“people problem,” and we had
solved-it on a personal level.—I
know I made more ofanimpacton
him than any court system ever
could have done. -

I checked up on what Chris
told me, since he fived:so-near me
at home, and like I thought, he
wasn’t lying. I just hope that he
goes on toimprove himself. That’s

‘what I told him when I left the

lawyers office. He told me that
until then he had thought I was a
vengeful bitch, but said he now
realized that I was just a person
too.

The problem with rapists is
that they make sex only a physical
act. They act like animals, for they
are ignoring that which makes
humans a distinct species. They
ignore their minds. . . but humans
have both minds and bodies. Good
sex involves the two. By continu-
ing to ignore the mental aspect of
sex, rapists will continue to rape,
for they will never find what they
are looking for via sex. I took a big
risk by handling my case the way
I did, but fortunately it worked out
for me. It might not have worked
with a less-receptive attacker.

I hope I accomplished a few
things by talking to you.

1. First of all, there is no such
thing as a typical rapist. Mine was

be anyone. So just be cautious.
Watch what you drink, and how
much. I don’t want to sound like
your mother, but be especially
careful with mixeddrinks. They’re
very easy to tamper with - and its
difficult to monitor what you’re
drinking. Alcohol puts your guard
down. I don’t know if I would
have been raped or not if I hadn’t
passed out, butat least I could have
fought back.

2. Secondly, weneed tocontinue
to talk about rape and make people
aware of it. The more we talk
about it the easier it will be for
victims. We need to remove the
social stigma of rape for the vic-
tims. We also need to let the rap-
ists know that their actions will
NOT be the cure to their problems, -
that by involving their victims it
will not make their problems go
away.

3. Finally, 1 want to make it clear
to you that anyone can-be.a victim
of rape. Age did not protect me,
nor being at a prestigious Univer-
sity. It happened at Princeton. It
happens here. It’s a problem you
can’t hide from. And it’s a prob-
lem that changed me forever.

In addition, I want to add
something about how the rape af-
fected my relations with other guys.
Initially 1 fooled around an awful
lot. I was trying to find out the
meaning of sex - why people re-
garded it as so important. To me it
was only a violation, a physical
act, and I couldn’t understand why
people revered it. After a while,
however, I began to feel extremely
guilty about how I was abusing my
body, and I felt used. I had to gain
control over my sexuality. So I
became an incredible tease. I had
to learn that I could say no, that
people could not take advantage of

e. .. that people couldn’t abuse
me. I regret to say that'this behav-
ior carried over into my first se-
mester here at Davidson, but I
thankfully can say that I am now
approximately the same person that
I was before my rape.

clout, but rather a far more benefi-
‘cial and potent form of power, i.e.
the power of persuasion. This
preferred approach does not re-
quire the employment of threats
and falsehoods (e.g: “During bas-
ketball games we just can’t keep
certain parts of the building open-
-” and “If closing eight times a year
for basketball games is that much
of an inconvenience, then we
should close it [at] 5:30 every day
so you could get used to it” and “If
not, we'll do like most bigger

schools and close down more” and —
“alotof people willknow Davidson

through: Davidson athletics, and
unfortunately that has been a tre-
mendousnegativein recent years rf);
Instead, the persuasive person will

encourage full consideration of the
issues by all concerned. Then,
with logic and facts and honesty as
allies, the persuasive person will

‘attempt to convince others of the

correctness of a particular conclu-
sion and proposed course of ac-
tion. This is the Davidson way,
according to my understanding.
There is no place in this sce-
nario for ad hominem attacks or
over-stated personal generaliza- -
tions (e.g. “Itis amazing how petty
and self-centered people can be”
and “--asmuchaswe hated Chapel-
-”’), These only create resentment,
ridicule and polarization. (By the
way, I daresay you didn’t actually
hate chapel; rather, you hated being
forced to gotochapel. You wanted
to make your own choices regard-
ing matters personal to you.) To-
day’s Davidson students are im-
bued with freedom of choice--and
they jealously guard that right
againstallassaults, whether froma

parent, a fellow student or a fa-
mous alumnus.

Hopefully you will soon learn
that there are many differences, es-
pecially cultural differences, be-
tween Davidson as you knew it
and the modern Davidson. Also,
hopefully, you will apologize to
‘the above-mentioned Davidson.
senior, for your ill-advised attempt
to impose your will on him, Such
behavior, if not repented of, will
create a chasm between you and
the Davidson student body that
will lead to no good.

I hope you will accept this
counsel as it is intended: to help
you and all the fine young future
American leaders enrolled at
Davidson to establish aclose bond
of mutual respect and admiration.

Sincerely,

effect be obvious. I have felt pow-
erless and angry and ashamed of
my gender, but what can I do but
commit myself to ending this vio-
lence through the example of my
own life, by confronting it directly
in my own life, and by offering my
love and dedicated support to these
women, to stand with them as they
tell their history. To stand by all
my friends whom I love and who
have been too long silent.

That is the only thing I still
cannot understand, the continuing

silence of victims. Here tonight we
speak for them and we speak for
ourselves. We have been harmed
and we: are seeking healing to-
gether as a community, dedicated
to re-creating our oursclves, in
order to become something much
better: a community in which ev-
eryone can be safe. - .

This is not just take back the
night, this is take back your whole
lives. You are doing something
tonight to heal and to strengthen,
walking and taking back your lives.

concern is for Miss Cobb herself.
Even after attending a month long
program at the Betty Ford Center
for chocoholics, Marlo is unstop-
pable. Itisourhope that this public

notoriety will finally let her see the
error of her ways. If not, we are
afraid she might end up like the
little boy in““Willie Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory” who drowned ~
ina chocolate river.
