| am sure that | need not worry that the richness granted my work by bilinguality

and allusion will by lost on your illustrious readers.

| should perhaps add that the title was supplied by my wife, who wished to remain
anonymous, and that the poem is dedicated to Gabe Winkler, at whose shrine |
once worshipped, and to David Lloyd, to whom, as far as | know, no shrine has yet

been erected.
Sincerely,
Alan White
