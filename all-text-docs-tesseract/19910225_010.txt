Which Cereals Are Best?

By Marlo Cobb
Whether it’s a habit of yours or
not, breakfast is very important.

Just one bagel will keep read-
ing skills, memory and concentra-
tion abilities up to par until your
next meal. Everyone knows about
the health risks associated with
eggs and bacon.

No cereal could be nutrition-
aly quite as bad, but some cereals
have lower fat and salt contents
and higher fiber than others.

Look for cereals with less than
100 mg sodium, less than 2g fat,
and with at least 2 grams of fiber
per serving.

Idon’tknow how many brands
of cereal exist out there; I only
looked at 25.

They were: 100% Bran, 100%
Natural Cereal, Bran Chex, Bran
Flakes, Cap’N Crunch, Cheerios,
Corn Flakes (Kellogg’s), Frosted
Flakes, Frosted Mini-Wheats, Fruit
‘N Fibre (Harvest Medley), Grape-
Nuts, Honey Nut Cheerios, Life,
Muesli (Raisin, Date & Almond),
Puffed Rice, Puffed Wheat, Tofal,
Raisin Bran (Post; better for you
than Kellogg’s), Rice Chex, Rice

Krispies, Special K, Spoon Size -

Shredded Wheat, Strawberry Fruit
Wheats, Sun Country Granola,and
Wheaties.

Here are some results, in terms
of fiber, fatand salt content: Fiber
losers: Cap’N Crunch, Corn
Flakes and Puffed Wheat (1g),
Frosted Flakes, Honey Nut
Cheerios, Puffed Rice, Rice Chex,
Rice Krispies, and Special K (<1g).

Fiber winners: 100% Bran
(20g), Bran Chex, Bran Flakes
and Fruit N’ Fibre (9g), 100%
Natural, Grape-Nuts, and Raisin
Bran (8g).

High-fat losers: 100% Natural
(39% calories from fat), Sun Coun-
try Granola (30%), 100% Bran
(25%), Cheerios (20%), Muesli
(16%).

Low-fat: Bran Flakes, Corn |

Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Grape-
Nuts, Puffed Corn, Puffed Wheat,
Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Shred-
ded Wheat, Special K, and Straw-
berry Fruit Wheats (0%).

High-sodium losers: Grape-
Nuts (680mg), Bran Chex
(450mg), 100% Bran (380mg),
Bran Flakes, Fruit N’ Fibre, and
Raisin Bran (360mg).

Low-sodium: Frosted Mini-
Wheats, Puffed Rice, Puffed
Wheat, Shredded Wheat (Omg),
Sun Country Granola (27mg),
Strawberry Fruit Wheats (30mg),
100% Natural (56mg). Everything
else was over 220 mg.

Spoon Size Shredded Wheat,
Frosted Mini-Wheats, and Straw-
berry Fruit Wheats are the overall
winners on my list of 25 (as far as
fat, salt, and fiber content are con-
cerned).

Fortified cereals, like Total,
basically come with a vitamin pill
in each serving, which isn’t a bad
“extra” if breakfast is the most
complete meal you’ ll be having all
day.

Weird Facts for the Week: On |
sugar: The commercials for “pure
cane sugar’ are right -- it’s health-
ier than any substitute.

Sugar only has around 15calo-
ries per teaspoon, and one side
effect of sugar substitutes like
Equal and Sweet ~N Low is that

: they actually increase cravings for

real sugar.

Also, studies have shown that
the saccharin and aspartame in
these sugar substitutes may be
cancer-causing.

On fiber: The vegetable with
the highest fiber content is a baked
potato with its skin.

On a nutritive level, Granola
bars are one of the biggest food
hoaxes ever; a Snickers bar con-

tains more fiber than a Nature

Valley Granola bar.

Deee-Lite Is Delightful

By Joe Binns

Deee-Lite
World Clique
Elektra

The big stink in pop for the last
week or sohas been Deee-Lite (or,
as one of my more eloquent asso-
ciates put it, “the Frenchchic aN
the two freaks”). Anyway, asI w:
driving home from Empress I was
thinking how much I would like to
hear “Groove is in the Heart.”

“Groove is in the heart--
ayayayay,” the voice of Lady Miss
Kier hadn’t left my head for two
days. She was making it hard to
concentrate, study, drive.

I couldn’t enjoy other music--
even old favorites. Indeed I hadcut
the venerable Howlin’ Wolf off
midway through “Louise” and
flung him to the floor mat on the
ride in.

But my means were slender.
The check book balance read $8.75
after the seven dollar buffet bill
and I knew I wouldn’t be getting a
work/study check this month be-
cause I quit work/study three years
ago.

I had twenty-two dollars
stashed between epiphanies. in
Portrait of the Artist... and this, my
spring-break fund which was to
get me to Florida in March, was in

bewildered. “Impulse,” he replied
and I completely understood.

We are not so different--you
and I. When you hear the tune you
too will want to possess it. But
don’t shell out fifteen for the disc.

The tape--maybe. The single--
definitely. There simply isn’t much
more to Deee-Lite than “Groove is
in the Heart.”

They are a product of Sam-
pladelic productions, slapped to-
gether to profit from the demand
for psychedelic dance/club music,
which is the big stink on the U.K.
club scene these days. They’re
doing well in the states though,
too.

Lady Miss Kier Kirby has a
face pretty enough to sell the disc
in an age when the video can be
more important than the song. As
long as MTV keeps showing her,
people will keep buying her.

Sampladelic has covered her
and her friends, Super DJ Dmitry
and Jungle DJ Towa Towa, in
enough paisleys, love beads and
polyester to keep her from being
associated with the bubble heads .
(ie. Samantha Fox, Jasmine Guy,
etc.) typically used to rob the audi-
ence that has kept Vanilla Ice at
number one for weeks,

They have also attempted to
build a mythology/terminology
around the trio. It is an idea that

jeopardy. “Yeah,” I said to myself
in a voice I. didn’t recognize,
“spring break isn’t that fun any-
way. I’ll just hang out here:at ol’
D.C. and watch some ‘cable. It
might be installed by then.”

The craters at the entrance to
D. Grier Martin Court ushered me
back into my wits. What had I been
thinking? Sacrifice sand, sun and

projectile vomiting with good

friends in the Keys for one stupid
song!
No sir! Though enraged at

having nearly been manipulated .
