Money For Renovating |

Union Available -- Currie

Business Manager Robert be one permanent private dining Currie said that work on Ine

A. Currie recently announc-
ed an estimated $184,000
plan to renovate the down-
Stairs of the College Union.
Included are funds to com-
pletely air-condition the
Union building.

The new plan makes use of the
area formerly used as ihe stud
ent store and games room. In
¢luded are the following
changes:

The kitchen of the cafeteria
will be expanded. and new facili-
ties and equipment will be pur-
chased to make the preparation
of food easier and more sanitary.

The current dining area will
become a permanent one which
will be used only during meal
times. New furniture will be
purchased for this area, and it
will be closed off so that it may
be kept clean when meals are
not being served.

The snack bar will be relocat-
ed in roughly the spot. where
the serving line is now located.
The location of the old snack
bar will become the new serving
line,

Part of the space now vacant
downstairs will be used for the
snack bar dining area. In other
words, the snack bar and the
cafeteria will be separated in
their operation.

The remainder of the space
downstairs will be utilized as
private dining rooms. The dining
rooms will be located in one
large room which can be divided
into four. In addition, there will

Health Officer Sees Slater
As Better In Union Cleanup

TOM LOFLIN

After two visits from Health Inspector Noah Walters last week, the employees of
Slater Food Service have taken definite steps to clean up the college’s cafeteria.
On Wednesday, cafeteria manager H. R. Bryson said that he thought his kitchen
was once again worthy of an “A” rating from the inspector.

Walters first inspected the kit-
ehen on Monday of last week.
and at that time removed the
old rating notice, an ‘‘A."" He
told THE DAVIDSONIAN the
following Wednesday that he
would return Friday to re-in-
spect the kitchen for a new
grade.

Walters did return last Friday,
but he changed his mind: about
inspecting the kitchen. Instead,
he had.a talk with the kitchen
help and explained to them the
results of his first inspection and
what he would look for on his
next one. He also went over
plans for the renovation of the
downstairs area of the Union
with Bryson and Business Man-
ager Robert A. Currie.

Walters is scheduled to return
the latter part of this week to
make his re-inspection. ‘‘When
they have brought that kitchen
up to standard. I intend to give
them their rating back,’’ Walters
said before leaving campus last
week. “I. plan to come back
pretty often to look at the place,
and I intend to get it clean even
if I have to live there."

Students may see for them-
selves whether or not the col-
lege’s cafeteria is stil! un-
derachieving in the area of
cleanliness by looking for the
rating. Until there Is a new
one posted, the college will not
have attained an acceptable
health standard In its eating
facilities.

When Walters was here last

Papers will be presented by! Friday. he first asked the kit-

students, including one by Dav-
idson’s Phil Lewis on Merleau-
Ponty (a French philosopher
who taught at the Sorbonne un-
til his death in 1961) and one by
Bill Ferris on Albert Camus.
There will be a series of panel
discussions in which all interest-
ed persons will have an oppor-
tunity to participate.

All sessions are tentatively
scheduled for the Cunningham
Fine Arts Building. Other pro-
jected activities include sessions
in which critica] comments on
the student papers will be pre-
sented, and.a banquet to be held
in the Morrison Room of the
Student Union.

Drs. Earl MacCormac and
George Abernethy of the David-
son Philosophy Department have
been holding discussions at their:
homes in order to prepare Dav-
idson students for the confer-
ence. Any who wish to attend
should contact Dr. Abernethy or
Dr. MacCormac at their earliest
opportunity.

— Se

chen employees how many of
them had read the state's health
code for eating establishments.
Not one of them raised his hand.

in agreeing with a DAVID-
SONIAN article printed three
days before his inspection of
the kitchen, Walters felt that
the presence of roaches is
Slater’s worst problem. He
also agreed with the article in
his comment on the floors:
“1 can't overlook the fact that
the cracks and crevices in
your floors are not clean. !
know that cracks in floors are
hard to clean, but ! cannot
allow that to be an excuse for
filth.“

Walters said that he noticed
quite a few rat droppings outside
the kitchen near the garbage
area. THE DAVIDSONIAN re-
ported evidence two weeks ago
that rats have also been inside’
the kitchen.

Walters reported that he had
found Slater had been using
newspapers to cover storage

shelves. ‘‘There should not be
newspapers in the kitchen,” Wal-
ters said. “Paper is good roach
feed.”

The college has now taken
steps to do away with the roach-
es and rats. Rodent-feeding sta-
tions have been set up all around
the campus to kill rats, and a
pest control company now comes
once a week to spray the kitchen
in an attempt to control roaches.

Lest fraternity men feel smug
in the knowledge that they do
not have to eat Slater meals,
Walters pointed out that the milk
shaker has not been cleaned
properly in the past. This ma-
chine is one of the hardest work-
ers at the snack bar.

Walters said that during his
inspection he noticed one of the
workers fixing salads by taking
fruit out of cans with her hands.
He also cited the facts that he.
found cigarette burns on tables
in the kitchen even though it is
illegal to smoke where food is

prepared and that the toilets
used by the help were not clean-
ed sufficiently.

Walters, however, at the end
of his falk Friday, compliment-
ed the workers on the improve-
ment that they had made in
cleaning the kitchen. “The
places ! glanced af today look
good,” he said. “There are
tremendous improvements al-
ready.”

Before he left. Currie told
Walters. ‘“‘One thing we don't
believe in putting off is sanita-
tion. At ‘no time have we ever
let what I call expense money
interfere with sanitation. We've
never had a health report that
we did not get on immediately
to clean things up.’

Currie never did say why, if
the college is so concerned about
cleanliness, it has been neces-
sary to wait for health reports
before taking action to keep the
kitchen clean.

Increase;

"Cats Not To Blame

BY CHARLES EDWARDS

“Even though we have
received 25 per cent more
applications than we had by
this time last year, I really
couldn’t say that I think that
much of the increase is due
to our success in basket-
ball,” stated Associate Di-
rector of Admissions H. Ed-
munds White.

“Of course, a good season
helps to bring Davidson to the
attention of those who might
have never heard of it before:
but no one thing has any great
effect on number of applica-
tions. Most other colleges are
experiencing the same rise in
applicants, due to the post-war
baby boom.”

Second Atheist Coming
For Y’s Forum Series

BY BRITT SNIDER

The fourth speaker. in the YMCA seres of “Challenges to the Christian Faith,”
Dr. Jose Barchilon, an atheist and an associate professor at Yeshiva University in
New York City, will appear for a series of addresses on Thursday, March 5.

Barchilon, Director of Educa-
tion at the Albert Einstein Col-
lege of Medicine at Yeshiva,
will be the second atheist
brought to campus by the Y
this semester. The topic for his
addresses and forum will be
**Religious Implications of Psy-
chology.”

His first address will be to the
student body during chapel
period, followed by a coffee hour
in the Morrison Room of the
Union. At 3 p.m. a discussion
will be held in the Morrison
Room, with the psychology de-
partments of Davidson and Char-
lotte College and a group of
Charlotte psychiatrists partici-
pating with Barchilon in a dis-
cussion of clinical problems in
psychology.

The forum will conclude
Thursday night with a short
address by Barchilon, follow-
ed by a discussion with Rabbi
Israel J. Gerber of Temple
Bethel in Charlotte and Dr.
W. G. Workman, professor of

psychology at Davidson. All
three men have doctorate de-
grees in psychology.

Barchilon since 1957 has serv-
ed as associate professor and as
psychiatrist at the Bronx Muni-
cipal Hospital Center in New
York. He attended medical
school at the University of Tou-
louse, and received his MD from

“Davidson has often been
criticized tately for its extreme
selectivity,” Ostwalt said.
“However, if we were not
selective, we would nof only
hurt our reputation as a top
school, but we'd flower our-
selves in the estimation of
schools which expect us to ac-
cept only their top graduates,”
he affirmed.

As each application is receiv-
ed, it is placed in a folder into

which all subsequent information
about the applicant is aiso plac-
ed. This additional information
includes: standardized test
scores, letters of recommenda-
tion and high school transcripts.

White suggested, ‘‘It would be

pose of reviewing applications.

made concerning the recip-
lents of the valuable McCon-
nelt, Harding, Johnson, Proc-
tor and Gamble, and honor
scholarships.

In reviewing these applicants
the board makes greatest use of
the letters of recommendation,
looking for students who would
make a “definite contribution
to the school.’ Determination of
good citizenship and wholesome
attitude are of primary consi-

Twenty-One Pupils Leave
Davidson's Sacred Halls

BY BILL BRIGGS

To make money, to join the
service, to recuperate from var-

ious sicknesses, and to seek
greener pastures at other schools
are a few of the reasons that 21
students decided to part com-
pany with Davidson College for
the second semester of _ this
school year.

Seven seniors—Steve Gramley,
Joe Jones, Ben McCoy, J. L.
Moore. R. O. Moss, Ted Scar-
boro and J. D. Whitehead—earn-
ed enough credits and hours to
graduate and consequently took
their Jeave of absence. Bob
Dixon, another senior, quit
school to go to work. He will
return this summer.

Juniors Howard Morris, Stew-
art Robinson and Robert Taylor
also dropped out of college this
semester. Robinson and Taylor,
armed with liberal educations,
transferred to schools of science,
math and farming at N. C. State
and Clemson respectively.

Truth cannot be compromised

Almighty God Jesus Christ the
Lord does not compromise. Peo-

all and there is no Fatherhood
of all and no brotherhood of all.
The sons of God and the sons of
Satan are no more brothers
than God and Satan are broth-

over by the world for Satan.

It is not strange, therefore,
that CHURCHES and CHURCH
SCHOOLS are teaching evolu-
tion and socialism and denying
the truth of the Holy Bible and
denying the Deity of Jesus, and
even inviting Atheists and Com-
munists to spread their ’poison

and of their students.

And such churches and church
schools are in many instances
discarding eternal security to

‘be found in God the Father,

Jesus Christ the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, and the Bible. the
infallible Word of God; and are
substituting therefore commun-
ism, social security, integration,

patriots and sob for traitors.

Such churches and such
church schools are in many in-
stances teaching man to trust
his eternal security in a One-
World Church, a One-World Gov-
ernment, a One-World Court, a
One-World Army, a One-World
Language, a One-World Mongrel
Race. and a One-World Social
Gospel which is a conglomera-
tion of all heathen religions with
Christianity discarded. All these
things actually are coming to

ary music as well as rarely-per-
formed music of the Renais-
sance,

In 1958 the 25 musicians won
acclaim with their performance
of Schoenberg's intricate Opus 27
at the Monday Evening Con-
certs. Their prestige was further
heightened by a special invita-
tion to sing at the Brussels
World Fair that same year.

Since that time the singers
have been invited to appear at
festivals in Edinburgh, Salzburg,
Darmstadt, Krefeld and Berlin.

The Gregg Smith Singers
concert will be held in Chambers
Auditorium open to the public.

Tickets are now on sale. All.

Davidson students will be admit-
ted free of charge.

The next and final concert of
the Artist Series season will be
the Juilliard String Quartet on
Tuesday, April 28.
