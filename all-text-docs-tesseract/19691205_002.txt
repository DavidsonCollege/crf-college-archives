In Time

It is only natural that, the student
whose number came high in the draft
lottery this week would like to dis-
affiliate himself, from further’ par-
ticipation in the, ROTC program.

For those already involved in che
advanced program this may or may
not be possible, but it is gratifying
to see the helpfuli response of the Da-
vidson ROTC’ Department in trying
to solve the student’s dilemma.

PMS Col. Virgil Foster, has quickly
won the applause of the'numbers of
Davidson students ; faced’ by such a
problem, and also from those on the
other side of the fence, whose num-
bers were low and'who wish now to
enroll in the ROTC program.

Foster acted quickly on behalf of
the students,"directing an immediate
inquiry to higher ranking officials
concerning the possibilities of dis-
affiliation and procedures for late en
rollment.

The brightest part of the action
is found in Foster’s concern for the

Of Need

students first, the ROTC ‘Department
second.

Certainly he feels that the number
of students now wanting to register
will offset those wishing to leave the
program; but this is quite noticeably
and quite admirably second in his
considerations.

Foster’s action regarding the pos-
sible programs of retreat was a pleas-
ant surprise, for it was a natural as-
sumption that the department would
be a bit displeased by requests for
dismissaL.from the ROTC’ program.

It is especially commendable when
one considers the suddenness of the
requests.

Whether Foster and the ROTC staff
will be able to work out a program
suitable to all parties concerned de-
pends upon a number of factors, no-
tably the decision of ranking army
officials concerning the problem.

But at least for the present Foster
is making easier a rather ticklish sit-
uation.

What: Are Girls Doing Here?

(Reprinted from The Daily Princeton-
ian, Princeton University.)

I am a coed at Princeton and I have
a question: What are girls doing here?

Answer one: Coeds came to Prince-
ton because college should be a place
where boys can assotiate with ‘girls
in relation to their intellectual grow-
th — not just as.sex objects. Answer
two: Coeds came to Princeton to re-
lieve the Princeton gentleman’s sex-
ual frustrations. Notice the peculiar
paradox in these answers.

Answer one has even been given
by Miss Bikini, who once said, ‘“‘We’re
here to get an education.” Answer
two shines out in that now-famous
phrase: “Coeducation. or masturba-
tion.” I can’t seem to identify with
answer two. Really, what am I sup-
posed to do? (Not to get dirty or any-
thing.) And yet answer one doesn’t
seem to take the whole picture into
account.

This brings us to’a most amazing
question: Is coeaucation real? College
men and women should be able .to
view each other as more phan sex
objects, but somehow there” is still
a problem: sex. At college we are he-
tween 18 and 22 years old and, amaz-
ingly enough, ‘sex is definitely very
much a part of our existence.

So the jackpot question is this:
What does one do until his mental
maturity matches his sexual maturity?
Let us examine the answers that col-
lege students have found: The old
answer was to sexually frustrate one-
self for four to eight years. That
solution is quickly dyimg, as Prince-
ton’s coeducation will prove. So we
get down to the second solution --
mess around a lot.

Obviously the second solution is
the one most accepted these days.

At least it is much better than turning

queer by the first method. But now '

we get to the climax question: Is this
most widely accepted solution the best
solution? I don’t think so.

Look around and see how many
people are strangely unhappy mess-
ing around. Look at the not-so-strange
ways that this unhappiness has shown
itself. Our generation_has been dis-
tinguished by cynicism, rebellion and
wild “kicks.” It boils down to a ques-
tion of whether people can be hap-
py_in_polygamous_ relationships.

Love can be aptly compared to in-
finity — in its abstract and unex-
plainable qualities, for instance. And
its hard enough to realize infinity
in one person, much less two or more.
So polygamy seemis to be the illusion
that sets in when. people aren’t al-
lowed to find infinity within one per-
son — when people aren't allowed
to think that they are capable of find-
ing a monogamous partner when their
bodies are physically capable of it.

We're not expected to be mature
enough, and it’s strange how adept
we are at fulfilling expectations, We
play games until someone thi e’re
“old enough” to entér the “‘rea’ ot
monogamous sexual relationships.
Games like dating. Unfortunately,
something happens in those years of
playing games — we get used to
games and make a game of life. Look
at the games people have made out
of marriage.

‘Why is it odd for people to marry
at age 16? It’s silly to say that every-
one should marry at 16, because we
know that polygamy is a definite hu-
man possibility. But a monogamous
person is not given a chance in so-
ciety’s structure. A monogamous per-
son is almost forced into the weirdness
of mental-physical separation before
he’s “old enough” to marry.

A Time Lapse —

Students of Davidson College, wel-
come back. After a brief intermis-
sion for Thanksgiving, it’s -good to
‘see all of you back again for another
brief intermission of classes hefore
Christmas recess begins.

It has struck many people as odd
that the academic schedule still main-
tains that there must be a period of
classes between Thanksgiving’ and
Christmas.

This is completely unnecessary,
now that Davidson is off the semes-
ter system and fully (?) converted to
the trimester concept.

There are actually three peculiari-
ties in the academic schedule for tlris
year: (1) that school started so late
(September 24th), (2) that there is
-a. short i of classes between
Thanksgiving and Christmas, and (3)
that the year ends so late (June 11th).
These curiosities are closely related
to one another.

If school had started on September
10th instead of September 24, we
could have ended exams of November
25 and had a forty-day vacation before
the start of the Winter term on Jan-
uary 5th.

September 10 is not an outrageously
early date for the beginning of school.

Most schools do start about then,
. but Davidson students are left be-
hind to tend the home fires or what-
ever until the late date of September,
24th rolls around. Summer jobs sel-
dom last that late into September
anyway,

Having a forty-day recess between
terms would be advantageous to many.
It would provide time in which small-
scale career service projects could

be undertaken, or special study pro-
jects, or reading for comprehensives.
The special program at Wofford Col-
lege in this vein has worked quite
well. ‘

Those students who need employ:
ment over the period would have an
additional two weeks — during the
Christmas rush — in which to draw
paychecks.

One consideration which should
not be taken seriously is the argument
that a September 10th strating date
would interfere with Orientation and
related opening ‘festivities. The over-
long five day orientation period
could be retained if the powérs that be
would schedule it: to in on Sep-
tember 4th. But then, there’s really
no reason why it has to be as long
as five days, either.

Another consideration is probably
worth overlooking. And that is. the
fact that by adding 14 days to the
first of the academic year, we would
only be gaining.12 extra days vaca-
tion. This objection is more than met
by’ the consideration of the time’s
being better spent between terms.

The other sore point is that school
will last this year until June 11th.
This seems unavoidable, for the most
part, given the necessity of a Spring
break of some sort. This year the
Spring break will last nine days, as
opposed to four last year. With a
four day break again this year, the
peat we could do would still be June
8th. ‘

But no matter how’ you look at it,
people aren’t missing too many days
of class, now are they?

[EDITED BY TOM WAY-AND ¢.L. CHESHIRE \

A popular belief among Davidson
students, and college students in gen-
eral, is that a literary work must be
abstruse, recondite, or packed with
allusions in order to be worthwhile.

Like most things, the majority cf
student writing “actually falls into a
middlemost category between the ex-
tremes of simple and complex. As
on other campuses, the most recent
trend in good quality student writing
at Davidson has been towards the
“complex pole with the production of
erudite and, often, seemingly erudite
short stories, poems, and essays.

Due to the unique environment of
the educational cloister in which ye
find ourselves, this complicated type
of scholarly work frequently appeals
to us. (After all, wouldn’t you rather
have your English prof spot you
reaching your personal peak of total
absorption with Carlyle’s “Sartor Re-
sartus” than to have him catch you
whimpering over a line from a thin,

tattered) volume of Emily Dickinson’s
best?) :

Obviously, one must be careful not
to limit oneself by narrowing his
scope to the appreciation of just the
scholarly, more serious; ‘heavier”
side of literature. Just as valuable
and often more appealing is a much
simpler style of writing, one that
practically condemns complex sen-
tences, a style of which Hemingway
is frequently cited as the modern
master.

To this point -—— the value and va-
lidity of unadorned writing — two in-
stallments of “Column” have been
devoted. The opening selection was
a poent which used an appropriate
dry an unembellished language to
depict famine in India. This week's
choice is a simply written short story
by California freshman Bruce Becker.
It is a lightly written, comic parallel
to the well-known Anglo-Saxon folk
epic, Beowulf.

When Sgt. Beowulf enter-

Lieutanent Higlac told our

To the Editor:

The covenant is complete.
The Educational Policy Corn-
mittee and the faculty have
come ,to terms. The spilled
blood of the sophomore is
only incidental..in this God-
sanctioned alliance.

Yes, rumor has it that the
and the faculty are
once again united. Their
short love spat resulted only
in a momentary lessening of
area, requirements and a set
of journalistic cat-calls; to-
day the faculty meets; is it
to re-institute the Area Kx-
aminations? (The eschato-
logical coming oof Christ!
Joy to the world!)

Faculty, please listen to
the voice in the wilderness.
I believe the EPC proposal
of several weeks ago was
a step in the right direction.
The added flexibility sug-
gested by their proposal
would. have benefitted the
program of education here.

The’ most recent faculty
decision, however, virtually
wiped out the Career-Ser-
vice and non-classroom study
program and in effect divid-
ed B.B.S.. (before Blue Sky)

gram into three terms rather
than two.

So, faculty members’ 'still
reading, please bring back
our beloved Area Exams.
But caution, a proposal too
similar to the earlier Great

only lead to an exodus put-
ting the Mt. Sinai event to

As one sophomore put it, “I kinda liked being a
part of something that was at least partly experimen-
tal; now all we have is more of the same.” ~

But what is more distressing than the action
itself (with implicit increase in class loads, an end
to the career service idea, probable harm to the
long-overdue honors college, and the ho-hum addition
of ‘another course), is the way the decision was made.

The action seemed at first to be laudable: “The
members of the faculty’made a painstaking study of
the whole question and finally voted, after much
conscientious debate, to abolish the exams.”’

But it didn’t happen that way. The abolition vote
was a fait accompli before the meeting was convened’
The session was preceded by a last-minute barrage
of alledged “proposals,” not all of. which were even

remotely feasible.

This prodigious proliferation of proposals —
“one every fifteen minutes,’ as one individual put
it — was accompanied by a frenzy of last minute ~
caucases. Organizers crowded into a small office,
telephones rang, security was maintained. It would
have been great at a national political convention;

but it may be that a colle
of such romantic scheming

ge has to forego the luxury

It seems singularly questionable that. members
of a decision-making body should maneuver i-
tiously to defeat the studied proposal of those of
their number who were elected to perform such a

function.

There were some who defended the decision on
the basis that, ‘the issues went above’thé committee.”
But if in:times of crisis, at times when crucial decisions
are made, we abandon those prescribed, ordered
processes which we in calmer moments devised, to

what do we turn?

If the faculty_standing committees are important
only where routine matters are concerned and irrele-
vant where matters of great importance are concern-
ed, then they have been emasculated to the point of
uselessness. And matters of. importance will’ have to
be hashed out in the precipitous climate that: pre-

vails on the floor of faculty

meetings.

To top off the abandonment of its own establish-

ed processes, the faculty voted to tur

the whole

matter over to a committee to be appointed by the

president of the college.

Memories are short. It has only been a few
years since faculty members insisted that the new
faculty constitution provide for elected committees

to handle important faculty business. And the most

important. faculty responsibility is that of the cur-
riculum, formerly overseen by the Educational Policy

Committee.

Why did it happen? Some didnot like the Blue Sky
Curriculum in the first place, though they voted for
it unanimously at its inception. (Including one entire
division which it appears would like to see it die.)
Some thought the situation was beyond help — the
only way to do better was to drop everything for a

new start .

But what is most distressing is that so many a
