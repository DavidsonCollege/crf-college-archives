Union Slates Second
Bridge Tournament

The bridge tournament held
March 30 in the College Union was
such a success and aroused so much
participant interest that a second
tournament has been scheduled.

This encote will be held Thurs-
day, April 21, at 8 p.m.; it is open
to professors, students, and towns-
people at the nominal price of
fifty cents.

Mr. J. A. Postell will be present
to direct play and lecture concern-
ing the fundementals of duplicate
bridge. As expert Charles Goren
explains, “For those who know a
very little about bridge and want
to learn to enjoy the game, there
is no better way than duplicate.”

All those interested in learning
and playing are urged to be present
on that date. Refreshments will be
served gratis.

The Southern Region Student
Conference for YMCA, YWCA and
SCA will be held June 10-17 at
Blue Ridge, N.C. The theme is
Creative Leadership. Some of the
leader-speakers are Dr. John
Hutchinson, editor of Christian
Faith and Social Action, Dr.
Charles Johnson, president. of Fisk
University and authority on the
South, and Dr. Frank Graham,
formerly president of UNC, and
now with the UN. .

The “Y¥” delegation last year
was Sam Magill, Leighton Green,
and Blake Brinkerhoff. These ail
felt they gained greatly from the
experience. It is hoped that the
group attending this year will be
much larger, so that a greater per-
centage of the student body will
learn the purpose and aims of Stu-
dent Christian Associations in con-
nection with world problems.

The cost vf the entire trip will
be about $40, but the “Y” hopes to
pay some of this expense. Anyone
interested in attending this con-
ference should see Mr. Magill at
the “Y" office.

D Club To Give ‘Foolies’
Before Friday Night Hop

For its annual Foolies preceding the dance Friday night
of Spring Frolics, the “D” Club is presenting a hilarious
parody on the musical “Show Boat.” With the addition of
music, the skit this year is more elaborate than in the past and
should prove to be one of the gayest, funniest Foolies ever to
be presented in Chambers Auditorium.

The plot includes the worn but

eternal triangle. Tommy Breeden, Joyner is the jovial Aunt Jemima.

Students Offered 5
Regional Law Grants
By Duke University

Five regional scholarships in the
Duke University Schoo! of Law,
worth $1000 each per year, will be
available to top. applicants in
North and South Carolina, Dean
J. A. MeClain has announced.

Worth potentially $3000 each
for the full three-year law course
if applicants maintain high grades,
the scholarships will be awarded
on 3 competitive basis, Dean Mc-
Clain said.

“Winners will begin study with
the opening of school next fall. All
residents of the two’ states who
qualify as entering law students
may apply. The. initial awards are
for one year and are renewable for
the full three years if holders
maintain a B average or better
in the School of Law,” Dean Mc-
Clain said.

The competition is open to resi-
dents of the two states regardless
of whether or not their college edu-
cation was completed within or
without North und South Carolina.

Specific eligibility requirements
call for applicants who hold
bachelor's degrees now or will com-
plete requirements for such de-
grees by June, 1955, in a standard
college and with an overall average
of B or higher.

In addition, each applicant will
be required to take the Law School
Admission Test, administered by
the Princeton Educational Testing
Service, 20 Nassau St., Princeton,
N.J. Application for taking this
test should be made at least 10
days in advance. The next date is
April 23, 1955, and the test will
be given at the University of North
Carolina and the University of
South Carolins.

“Qualities of character, person-
ality and leadership will be con-
sidered, as well as_ scholastic
ability,” Dean MeClain said.

In the absence of fully qualified
students, the right to omit awards
in any given year is reserved. In-
terviews for applicants will be ar-
ranged and details announced soon.
he added.

In the meantime, those desiring
to apply and to enter the com-
petition should write the Office of
the Dean, Duke University School
of Law, Durham, N.C.

Included in the ribald humor of
the skit will be the appearance of
Harold MeKeithen and Jimmy Mar-
tin, giving their comic renditions
of “Kiss of Fire” and “Fernando's
Hideaway." A chorus line com-
posed of the coaching staff of the
college is also scheduled to draw
laughs. A sizzling interpretation of
“Steam Heat,” a dance from the
current hit “Pajama Game,” will
be presented by Mary Jo Whittle
and Henry Parrish. The Lamp-
lighters will sing “Mood Indigo.”

The tender duets by Magnolia
and Gaylord—"Can’t Help Loving
That Man of Mine” and “Make Be-
lieve”—will comprise the high
spots of the show. The lyrics used
are not the conventional ones, but
original lyrics that will appeal
more to the Davidson student body
have been substituted.

Music for the show will be con-
ducted by John Garvey, who has
not only arranged the traditional
“Show Boat” melodies, but who has
also added some very fine original
music of his own. The opening
“Show Boat’s Coming” is a peppy
number by Garvey which makes
the first scene look like something
from Broadway.
