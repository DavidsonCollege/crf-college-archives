Davidson’s new era in. col-
lege football suffered a stag-
gering blow last Saturday

palachian State University in
a 30-0 loss. It was the first
contest of the 1974 season for
the Wildcats. *

‘coach Ed parrel, “but
there’s no way “we're the
least bit discouraged. I felt
we continued ‘to hustle and
we proved we can hit. I don’t
think they out-hit us.”

The Wildcats never
penetrated the Appalachian
$8 yard-line and were plagued
by. third down and long
yardage situations. They only
managed 111 total yards as
M quarterback Dave ‘Harper
completed nine of twenty
passes for 87 yards in the air.
"The Cats fumbled the ball
away twice, but made two in-
{terceptions and recovered
three Appalachian fumbles. °

and defense rather than a

What can I say? One moment I walk innocently
into THE DAVIDSONIAN office,‘a mere assistant
managing editor (you see, everyone on this staff
has a title; it’s part of our participatory democracy
system), and I emerged shortly thereafter a dazed
and bem sports‘editor.

Three quantum. jumps upward in title and four
less hours sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

But that much in itself I can handle. No matter
that I know next to nothing about the D.C. sports
scene. I have a feeling that I’ll learn damned quick.
So what if I have a staff of none; just plagiarize
from. the Observer and keep the IMAC columns
coming:

If that isn’t enough, all I have to do is whip out a
sports column full of double entendres (find one if
you ¢ ), jokes about wimps, guesses about the

982 fodtball schedule, and praise for the fine new
track (see related article).

Half my pages are ads, and half/of the rest is -

over-developed pictures. “The rest’ no one reads

anyway: And since you gave up on this column in ¥-

the middle of the last paragraph, it should now be
safe for me to unveil my four-point program for in-
jecting new life into the sports department.

Point the First: Put gum along the outside edges J

‘of the pages, and use a lighter weight of paper. You
might think Big Bambus make party joints. Wait
until you roll with the sports pages.

Point the Second: Determine if any other college
in the nation plays that singular sport of flickerball.
After the response is found to be rather negative,
proclaim the winner of the IMAC jousts to be the
IMAC World Champions and -do four pages of
features on them each week for the rest of the year.

Point the : Junk the present format (words
and pictures) for nine one inch in diameter
black circles artistically arranged, three rows of
three circles, and sell the pages to ROTC for small

arms practice.

An alternative ‘would be to cut the circles out
and wear one 0! back so the men in blue.could
sharpen theif ski like our. boys in green do.

Point the Fourth: Diligently stick to Point the
First,

Harper’s performance
pleased Coach Farrell. - ‘I
thought he called a good of-

fensive game,” he said. But ’ IN THE CLEAR
Harper So ncw-to“Partelrs A Meher ball @ilttan nte calmly surveys his options before «

program and is having to
start all over again, working
on things a senior doesn’t
normally work on.

Davidson’s schedule has
been toned down somewhat
this year; yet it will provide
plenty of competition for the
Cats as they test the wings
of Farrell’s prograni‘here. ‘‘I
would be surprised if.
anybody we play has better
material than Appalachian,”
Farrell said. -

There were a few minor in-
juries on Saturday, but none

of them were serious enough -

to lose anybody for any
period of time. Jose Rodri-
quez has a slight shoulder
seperation which might keep.
him out of the VMI. game.

Farrell remained optimistic |
about the chances of a winn-
ing season. “The ingredients
to be winners are here, with
a realistic schedule. We have
no excuses, but we’re not far
away from being a good foot-
ball team,’’ he concluded.
