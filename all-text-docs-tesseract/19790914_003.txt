The delay of a federal grant in
Washington has put a tempor-

ary damper on Davideon and ~

UNC-Charlotte’s Semester in
India program. Although the
$1700 per student grant was
appropriated in July by Congr-
ess, a delay in the Treasury
Department has forced a two-

week postponement for depart-
ure

Studies Professor Job Thomas,
the 11 students participating,
including seven from Davidson,
will be leaving for India on
September 13th, not the origin-
ally scheduled date of August
27th.

A lack of communication
between the U.S. Office of
Education and the Treasury
Department caused the delay of
funds, which were not released
until last week. .

While in India the students
will study at the University of
Madras, where they will investi-
gate various aspects of Indian
culture--geography, religion, hi-
story, language and the people

moverd to jobs which Rolland
says they feel less qualified for.

The Personnel Department of
the College has issued a state-
ment denying the allegations of
the complaint.

One of the employees, Bill
Rolland, filed a ‘‘Charge against
Employer” with the NLRB in

themselves--through lectures
by native specialists in each
field. Students will also be
travellmg widely across India,
and will write a erp eee
based on this field work.

Thomas, a native of India,
said of the program,‘‘This is a
very good opportunity for Dav-
idson College students to be
exposed to a non-Western cult-
ure. I am quite happy to be
sending the largest contingent
in the program.”’

Students participating in this
year’s program will receive four
course creedits for their work in
India. Junior Carole Loptson, a
participant in the 1979 progr-
am, said of those who will be
attending the India program,
“The group is really diverse,
interesting, and outgoing. We
are all looking forward to this

wonderful learning experience.” '

Students selected to particip-
ate in the program must have at
least a 2.75 GPA and have
completed two years of academ-
ic work. Beginning this winter
applications will be accepted
from rising juniors for the 1980
program.

June of this year. The charge
was investigated by an NLRB
field examiner, and the result of
that investigation was the com-
plaint issued by the board.

The case began when each of
the three employees was given a
reprimand in September of 1978
by their supervisor, Phillip
Cashion. The reprimands con-

Rolland claims not one of the
employees involved knew about
the reprimands until almost five
monthslater. .

Then, on January ll, 1979,

cedures. These were that pay-
checks would be given out at
4:00 P.M., rather than earlier in
the day. Also workers would be
required to begin checking in
and out at lunch time. Rolland
considered both of these actions
unnecessary inconveniences.
Rolland felt the changes in
the procedures occurred because

- he and McIntosh had asked for

their paycheck at an earlier
time. “we privately felt it had
something to do with us,’’ said
Rolland. .
Physioal Plant Director Gro-
ver Meetze gave another repri-

mand to the three employees |

approximately two weeks after
the petition was drawn up and
presented. As a result, ail three
were transferred to different
jobs, and put on ninety days’
probation. Their pay rate, sen-
iority,, and benefits remained
the same as before the repri-
mands were issued.

— “According to the College's

statement, the actions were
taken because of ‘‘continued
conduct, which, according to
other employees as well as the
supervisor, interrupted the or-
derly flow of work, tended to
undermine the authority of the
supervisor, was offensive to
fellow workers, and contributed
to a state of tension and poor
morale in the department.”
Rolland denies all af thaaa

charges. When esked whether .

the other enployees agreed with
him, he said that six employees
sign an
the
January reprimand.

The three employees then
requested a hearing before an

1979— Th

January reprimand was to
stand. The committee also rec-
ommended that the three em-
ployees be returned to their
original jobs after such time had
passed as decided by their
superiors.

Only one of the employees—
David Alexander—has been re-
turned to his original job.
Rolland feels Alexander was
given his former duties back
because of the Labor Board
complaint.

Rolland feels he was repri-
manded for stating there was
a communications problem in
the department. “I was given a
reprimand for drawing up a
petition,” he said. ‘‘For a minor
offense if it’s an offense at all.”

Meetze and Cashion refused
to make any more comment
than what was in the statement
issued by the Personnel Depart-
ment. When asked about the
case, College President Samuel!
Spencer said that because the
case had become a legal one, the
advice of the College’s legal
counsel was not to say anything
beyond the prepared statement.

* Rolland said that.he has been
expressing the feelings of the
other employees, although they
have been mostly silent. ‘They
keep their complaints to them-
selves,” he said: “I thought
they needed voicing.’’ He feels
talking openly about things is

ing will be held before an
administrative court, not a legal
court. The judge in the hearing
will be employed by the board,

Ad Hoc grievance committee and Rolland will be represented

appointed by the President
accordance with the procedures
for hourly staff outlined by the
College. After the hearings, the
committee of two professors
and an administrator ordered
the first reprimand removed
from the employees’files. The

Rolland thinks he can win,
and said he would feel he had
won if he was returned to his
former job. He also says he has
never considered quitting the
Physical Play, or moving from
Davidson.
