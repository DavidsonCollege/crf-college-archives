Hamutenya speaks on Namibian crisis

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Namibian citizen —_ Lucia
Hamutenya, a member of
SWAPO Africa
People’s Organization) and a
Political Affairs officer for
Namibia at the United Nations in
New York, spoke to Davidson
students and faculty last Wednes-
day on the present condition of
Namibia. Namibia is the only col-
ony in Africa and is occupied by
South African military forces.

“The South African forces
have brought death and destruc-
tion to the Namibian people,”
Hamutenya said. “Yet the Nami-
bian people are continuing a strug-
gle they have fought since 1884,
when the German colonialists
‘discovered’ Namibia.”

Hamutenya said that trade un-
ions carried on the Namibian re-
sistance movement between 1907
and 1960 by resisting South Af-
rica’s attempts to remove the
Namibian people from the cities to
homelands.

“As dissatisfaction with apar-
theid increased,” she said, ‘the
people got more and more unified
and formed an_ organization.
These groups came together in the
form of a national liberation
movement — SWAPO — in
April, 1960. South Africa reacted
to this by detaining the leaders of
SWAPO.” Hamutenya said that
SWAPO leaders were finally
forced into exile.

Hamutenya added that by ad-
mission of the South Africans
themselves, SWAPO today can
“harness” over 80 percent of the
population. “This includes
women, children, youth, and the
elderly,” she said.

Hamutenya said that the dip-
lomatic struggle against South Af-
rica has also been successful.
“The entire international commu-
nity supports the Namibian
people,” she said. “We have the
support of the O.A.U., the Or-
ganization for African Unity,
which has given us shelter and

food. SWAPO also enjoys the
support of the U.N., which de-
clared SWAPO in 1973 as the sole
representative of the Namibian
people. SWAPO also enjoys the
support of the non-aligned com-
munity.”

Yet, Hamutenya noted that
SWAPO has had difficulties with
its struggle against colonialism.
“This is mainly caused by the
South Africans and those Nami-
bians who sided with the South
Africans and helped them retain
their stranglehold ver Namibia.”

Hamutenya said that the

United Nations has assumed a role
of responsibility as liberator of
Namibia. U.N. Resolution 385 of
1976 called for the withdrawal of
South African troops immediately
and unconditionally and for the re-
lease of all political prisoners, the
repatriation of all exiled Nami-
bians, and the holding of fair elec-
tions.

“At this time, the Carter ad-
ministration decided that the
Western countries had the neces-
sary means to exert pressure on
South Africa and to force it to
comply with the U.N. resolu-

Gifts-in-Kind ties companies with colleges

By AARON LEVINE

There is a “corporate” head-
quarters here at Davidson within a
minute’s walking distance of the
Davidson College campus. The
Company/College Gifts-in-Kind
Clearing House, a non-profit or-
ganization founded in September,
1983, is designed to coordinate
the donation of surplus or obsolete
equipment by businesses to the or-
ganization’s member colleges.

If a college has no need for an
item, then the clearing house
works to find a suitable buyer for
it. The college can have the item
traded or sold by the clearing
house. Obtaining a piece of used
and/or obsolete equipment is usu-
ally less expensive than purchas-
ing the same item first-hand.

Each college pays a $1,000
membership fee and in return the
school is awarded one dollar with
which to purchase items.

If two schools desire the same
item, then the school with the
highest bid in points receives the
item. If one of the schools recently
received many items through the
clearing house, then the school
with fewer recently expended
points would obtain the item.
Since the main goal of the clearing
house is to get rid of merchandise,
then it does not really matter if a
member school is in a deficit point
situation. The system can not in-
terfere with the purpose.

The clearing house deals with
almost any item a corporation
casts off, from glassware and bird
cages to a factory itself. Recently,

Guilford Mills donated a textile
mill in Lowell, N.C. The clearing
house sold the item for $600,000
payable over the next five years.
The money is being plowed back
into the clearing house to keep
rates down.

Member colleges can also do-
nate and receive material from
each other. Each school starts
with $20,000 worth of credit

which increases when the school
puts something into the system
and decreases when it receives
something. As founder and Exec-
utive Director Jim Herring states:
“Since they're getting all this free
stuff, they’re supposed to put
something back in. It's a self-reg-
ulating system.”

Items that Davidson has re-
cently received include mirrors

for the Drama _ department,
glassware for lab work, furniture
for the Union, and a hot press.
Typical recent corporate donators
have been Martin-Marietta, with
motor loaders and pick-up trucks,
the Myrtle Beach Hilton with fur-
niture,; and Land O° Frost Foods
with food processing equipment

Herring, a Harvard M.B.A

tion,” she said. “After two years
of negotiations they came out with
a plan agreed upon by both South
Africa and Namibia, which called
for U.N. troops to remain as a
token force in Namibia and for the
formation of a demilitarized zone
between Angola and Namibia.”

Hamutenya said the plan was
accepted and presented to the
U.N. Security Council and
adopted in 1978 as Resolution
435. “All that was needed was the
signing of a ceasefire by South Af-
rica and SWAPO.” she said.

She noted: “That did not hap-
pen, because it appeared later on
that those who assigned for us the
role of liberator simply wanted to
buy more time for South Africa to
carry on its illegal role in Namibia
and further deepen the crisis.” At
present, the resolution is still out-
standing.

Today, Hamutenya © said,
Namibia ts still struggling for its
independence, while South Africa
continues to oppress the citizens
of Namibia. “On June 17. the
South African government estab-
lished an interim government in
Namibia,” she said. “Upon the
formation of that, assassin guards
unleashed their violence upon a
crowd of innocent civilians. Many
were hospitalized, but nobody
died. They beat many of them so
much that they broke their arms
and legs. People saw this on tele-
vision in Western Europe, but the
U.S. media has not reported it.”

and former manager of Credit
Cards and director for New Ven
tures with Atlantic Richfield,
plans to expand, especially to the
West Coast in an attempt to be
come nationwide. Despite the big
plans, the purpose remains the
same. Herring candidates, “Our
purpose is not to raise money, but
to turn useless business goods into

useful college equipment ”
