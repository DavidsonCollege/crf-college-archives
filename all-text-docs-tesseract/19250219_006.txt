THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 19, 1925

Dr. Hood Lectures in
Two Southern Cities

Prominent Professor of Psychology
Will be Heard in Louisville Also

Dr. Frazer Hood, Professor of Psychol-
ogy in the Davidson faculty, is now in Nash-
ville, Tenn., delivering a series of lectures
similar to the group which he presented at
various colleges during the past fall.
Hood's prominence in the field of applied
psychology has caused him to be sought after
to fill numerous engagements on the plat-
form.

The past week Dr. Hood was received with
such enthusiasm at Richmond Seminary that
the unusual honor of featuring the lecture in
full in the next issue of the college magazine
has been accorded him. The unusual material
contained and the force with which Dr.
Hood presented this talk on certain newly-
viewed aspects of psychology is deserving of
this note.

During the first week in March, Dr. Hood
goes to Louisville, Ky., to lecture before the
students of the Seminary on the general sub-
ject of The Psychology of Preaching. The
first topic in the series is to be that of Gain-
ing Attention, The second day in natural
succession will come J/olding lttention ; then
the third, the clinching of the matter in
Fixing the Impression. The conclusion of
the group will be the often neglected but all-
important /nstigating Response. The value
of the application of modern psychology to
speaking from the pulpit is being emphasized
in the training of students preparing for the
ministry.
and thus are of great practical value.

In a tame affair here Thursday night
Coach Rawson's fighting fresh quint
triumphed over the strong Senior team |
from the Charlotte “Y.” The final count |
was 40-24 in favor of the locals. Two}
complete teams and several individuals |

The crashing Kitten quintette. showed
marked improvement over-their previous
court encounters and bid fair to make a
good showing against Oak Ridge, Duke,
Wake Forest and State on the trip they

the “Y” boys outclassed in practically ;
every department of the game, Wilson’s |
defensive play and the aggresive of- !
fense of Milner and Harrison were out-
standing for Davidson, while Lomax and ;
Mallory were the two outstanding play- |

Confidence in Ford
Performance

The owner of a Ford is never
in doubt as to what he can
expect in service. He knows
what his car will do and how
sturdily it will do it.

When bad weather and roads put
other cars out of commission, the
Ford car will stay on the job. It
will carry through slush and snow,
over frozen ruts, newly constructed

roads—anywhere.

Yet Ford benefits can be yours for
the lowest prices ever offered. This
is made possible by the efficiency of
Ford manufacture, the volume of ovt-
put and practically limitless resources.

In he carly part of April, an extensive
canvass is to be made by the authorities

an endowment fund for the school.

the resources of the college before it

South, The only requirement of the As-
sociation, which Queens has not yet been
able to meet, is in regard to finances.
The school has eight departments in the
literary course; there are 7,000 volumes
in the library; and the entrance require-
ments are the same as those of the lead-
ing colleges.

cessfully directed campaigns for other
schools, including those of Agnes Scott
and Davidson, will manage this drive.

jalumnae; $50,000 from the women’s or-
| ganizations; $75,000 from the citizens of
| Charlotte; $50,000 from the large gifts
| committee ; and $100,000 from the ter-
| ritory outside of Charlotte.

of trustees; Dr. W. H. Frazer, president
of the college; Malcolm Lockhart, direc-
|tor; E. E, Jones, treasurer; J. A. Mc-

Ministerial Band Holds
Feed and Regular Meet

Carr Resigns Presidency at Meeting
—Professor Fleagle Speaks
at Feed

The Ministerial Band held its regular
meeting last Sunday evening in Shearer
Hall. The business of the band was
taken up. Jim Carr, president of the
band, offered his resignation as presi-
dent on account of having accepted work
that will call him off the hill every Sun-
day. The election of a new president
|was postponed until the next meeting.

After the business had been disposed
of, the meeting was turned over to Al-
ford Moffett who led the band in a stu-
‘dent meeting. After the song service,
Jack Hand, Murchison, and Stewart led
in prayer while Hodgkin played Just As
I Am on the piano. Moffett then read
jthe third chapter of Philippians for the
scripture lesson, after which he discuss-
ed briefly the problems the ministerial
candidates face every day.

The meeting was then thrown open for
discussion. Lyerly, McRae, Kauffelt, J.
M. Garrison, Jim Carr and Paul Free-
land discussed the various phases of col-
lege life and campus activities that. af-
fect the ministerial candidate’s life. Jim
Carr summarized the discussion in the
one word “compromise.” ‘Put aside the
compromises and get close to Jesus.”

The band was dismissed by repetition
of the Lord’s prayer in unison,

At an adjourned meeting last Satur-
day night in the basement of the church,
36 ministerial students gathered for a
feed-ind social hour at which Prof, F. K.
Fleagle, guest of the evening, spoke in
regard to the relations of the ministerial
student to his fellow students and to
various student activiies.
