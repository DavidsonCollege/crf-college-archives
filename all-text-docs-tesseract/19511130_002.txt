Take Half Hour To Give A Pint;
It May Save A Kid A Lifetime

We who have been spared the blood of battle get our
chance to pay a little down on our great debt, to those whose
blood has run freely for us.

The Blood Bank is open for our deposit Monday from
11 a.m., until 5 p.m. There will. be litthe ionger waiting than
there is in any teller's line, and the nice part about it is that
you'll never miss what you've paid out. Before you know it
you've earned that amount back, without laying out a bit of
effort in the earning.

Last year, the community of Davidson set 2 Mecklenburg
County record with 400 pints of blood donated in one day.
Of an approximate 850 total, that’s better than 450 of student
body not contributing. Our guess is that over 75 men at the
most are unable physically to give a pint of blood. The town
of Davidson and the student body ought to top 800 pints. It
can be done, and easily, if the student body will take the time
to sign up for a donation period and then give about thirty
minutes of his time to go by the gym and contribute.

A half hour of your time will mean a lifetime for a kid
just your age—or younger—half way around the world.

To Rise To Cultural Occasion
One Should Be Properly Atied

When the Davidson gentleman goes calling on his first
lady, chances are he’s attired for the occasion. But when one of
the first ladies of the theater appears in Chambers Monday night.
chances are that same gentleman will drift into her presence in
tee-shirt, wranglers, and fatigue jacket.

Time was when a concert or appearance of a public dig-
nitary before an audience of Davidson men meant an equally
dignified appearance on the part of that audience. Some say rhe
vets did it, bringing the casual dress of the outdoor USO show
into the cultured atmosphere of a college artist series. At any
rate, Davidsonian dress for such events has slipped to a point
below that which one would want to see at a pep rally. ©

This isn’t to pan the dress of the Davidson man in class,
at a dance, or a ball game. He'll be enplumed like 3 fashion plate
if the occasion requires, or dressed as comfortably as the next cow-
poke when he desires. But at an evening performance where the
principal is formally attired, and ushers in tux, and outside
guests present, the Davidson man blots the picture when he
shows up looking as if he just dashed over from the boarding
house after washing dishes. ;

It's easier just to drop in on the way to the library and
continue on your way afterwards. Dressing’s a bother. Certain-
ly, but no more so than for any other social event. Our social
immaturity begins to show through when it looks as if we don’t
know when the time has come to slick our hair down.

How above it. Put a tie on to impress a lady?

Apologizing, Davidsonian Gives
True Side of “Speaker Screen”

A news story in the November 16 issue of The Davidsonian
concerning the formation of a Young Republican party—the
Hurry Harry Home Club—carried with it the unintended im-
plication that the executive committee had discriminately at-
tempted to thwart progress of such a club by ‘screening’ any
speakers that organization would intend to bring to the campus.

This confusion of the true picture of the club’s grant of
origin from the executive committee was clouded by The David-
sonian in that it obtained only a one-sided report of the story, an
unpardonable journalistic sin for which The Davidsonian would
like to editorially apologize. ,

The executive committee granted Lining Burnett, a sopho-
more, and Malcolm Williamson, a freshman, permission to or-
ganize the political group, with Dean John C. Bailey advising
the men that they should clear their speakers with either Dr.
Cunningham or himself before issuing speaker invitations. Such
is the practice for all organizations on the campus, not having
a faculty advisor. Dean Bailey's remark was advice aside to
Burnett, and was not even recorded in the committee minutes.

Particularly with a political club does it seem sensible to
have a faculty or administration clearing house. A political club
on a small campus at Davidson would hardly be outstanding
enough to stand as the “Young Republican Club of Davidson
College,” and thus have the public know that that particular
group had invited a certain speaker, rather than the College at
large. The speaker's presence would be associated with the Col-
lege: and small politician—and there exist such—might well use
a Davidson invitation as a mark of prestige on his record. Also
there are many members of either party who might be invited
who could hardly give a clear presentation of that party’s na-
tional platform.

The College, then, with a great deal at stake in such a ven-
_ ture, certainly reserves the right to protect its name and the
interest of the student body at large.

For the uninitiated and transfers,
Monday will be a terrifying and in
some ways different day, for on
Monday, “young blood must have
its course, lad, and every dog his
day.” The world will, once again,
come to Davidson. And when day
is done, the world will retreat into
its corner, enriched by what?
Knowledge, discretion, honor wis-
dom? Nay, brethren, the world will
float away on the crimson, surging
waves of the Davidson gentlemen’s
blood, said waves neatly and un-
poetically packed in pint bottles,
labled as to color and consistency.

A word of orientation is in order.
Prerequisite for minors to such a
sacrifice is an authoritative signa-

cheerfully titled slip of paper says
that it’s perfectly all right with

this; actually it’s a lot more bind-
ing. A closer inspection of its stip-
ulations might be rewarding.

Actually, there is nothing to this

just bends it and takes a little
longer to pull out. Conditions are

all back in’ the little hole in your
arm if you have time to wait.

So you see, seriously, there's
nothing to it. It’s the very least
we can do. And it might be well to
end on a not often enough quoted
note that holds as much truth as
exaggeration: some of us may be
over there in time to use it our-
selves.

Where Does The Davidsonian Stand
On Controversial Student Issues?

Dear Sir:

There seems to be a growing
need for certain issues to be ob-
jectively analyzed and discussed in
the editorials and columns of the
Davidsonian, where all the facts can
be presented and the issue then eval-
uated by student opinion. The view
is fast becoming prevalent on the
campus that you are not fulfilling
this obligation to the students.
“Criticism is the price one pays for
leadership.” How much more hon-
orable it would be if the Davidso-
nian could be criticized for what it
said, rather than for what it does
not 8aYe

I would like to offer the follow:
ing analysis for your consideration:

1. Your editorials do not dis-
cuss “live” issues. Why not present
student versus administration views
on the cut system, holidays, chapel,
compulsory vespers, rush week, and
hell week? It would not be neces-
sary for you to be an advocate of
either side on an issue; however,
it is important that you submit the
facts and views for student evalua-
tion.

By some two-fisted editorials
you could create an active interest
in the paper, provoke student
thought and discussion, and become

A. Gift Fund

Entails Major Changes

As director of the Christmas
Gift Fund, I feel that I should an-
nounce to the student body at
large the principles upon which
the Gife Fund will be organized.
There will be several major
changes.

First, I shall send no publicity
releases to any newspapers. In the
past, the Charlotte, Greensboro,
Winstor-Salem, etc, papers have
given us space and publicity. This
will not be the policy this year.
Those who give in order to be
seen by men, already have their re-
ward. The general public shall not
know about this Gift Fund.

Second, the pressure put on the
student to give shall be reduced.
There will be an adequate statement
of the need, the projects will be
presented, and after that, it is up
to you. There will be no emotional
appeals, and no deluge of posters
and the like. I feel that every man
here is mature enough to think out
whether or not, or how much he
should give. If you decide against
giving, that’s all right. The im-
portant thing to avoid is to place
you under such influence and pres-
sure that you would give because
of this pressure in spite of your
inner feelings. You haye then com-
promised yourself, and that dam-
ages values far above what you
might give,

The drive will open Friday, De-
cember 7th, in chapel. The projects
will be presented by some member
of the student body. That night the
Davideonian

will have a front page
spread on the Gilt Fund, giving

full facts and details. A small
pamphlet will be put in the room
of every student. This pamphlet
is for you to keep during the week
so that the need and facts will be
right in front of you. This is sub-
stantially all the organized pub-
licity that there will be.

Our goal this year is $6000. Of
this, $3000 is to be given to Caswell
Training School in Kinston, N.C,,
to build a recreational area for
over 600 mentally and physically
handicapped boys and girls. $1500
will go to the Negroes here in
Davidson to help build a colored
YMCA for their children, who now
have no place to go, even to hang
out, The remaining $1500 will be
sent to India, through a reliable
organization, to help in the develop-
ment of a pilot project (the first
of its kind). A power dam is being
buile near a mountain village, and
the economy of the village and sur-
rounding area is being disrupted.
This project is a. model project to
modernize an entizre area at one
time.

There are about 800 of you in
the Student Body, Each man’s por-
tion of the goat is $7.50.

The method of collecting the
money will remain unchanged. Each
hall will have two canvassers. You
may give cash, check, or pledge
that you will psy by January 10,
Your pledge can then be counted
in the total collected,

ODK SPEAKS:

By BRYAN ROBINSON

Last week I outlined what I
conceived the principles and pur-
poses of ODK to be, I dwelt at
some length on its motivating be-
liefs and, in general, how they
should be applied. This week I am
prepared to put some teeth into the
program. I am neither naive or
simple, and I realize that any or-
ganization, to be effective, must
translate its ideals into every-day
life. There must be something con-
crete there, something to align
yourself with, or to fight against.
There must be something that chal-
lenges the mind, as well as the
heart, the soul, and the hand. If
stimulation is not provided, if op-
portunity for experimental and
courageous living is not presented,
we have not lived up to the name
of Omicron Delta Kappa, and, on
a broader level, have failed you
as members of the human race,

The program 1 will outline be-
low, therefore, may be character-
ized in the following way. Every
point on this program does not
necessarily have the approval of
every member of ODK, but enough
are interested in that particular
point to justify its inclusion. We
are in dead earnestness in present-
ing this program. It is not merely
academic. We would like to see it
made flesh. Some of the points

THE CABBAGE PLANTER:

Is International Relations Club
Falling Ineffectively Short?

In an era when the peoples of
the world must learn to live to-
gether if mankind is to survive the
age of the exploding atom, it seems
imperative that every possible
means be utilized to bring about
the harmonious international rela-
tions, especially in the realm of
higher education of which David-
son is a part.

We have had on the campus for
the past several years an organiza-
tion known as the International Re-
lations Club, whose main purpose
seems to be to evoke cries of “Ink,
ink” in chapel, meet now and then,
and take up a couple of pages. in
the annual—complete with pictures.

Last year under the leadership
of President Gray Hampton, IRC
started a rejuvenation program
which in theory sounded like the
organization was finally getting on
the ball, but which in actual prac-
tice, soon seemed to fizzle out.
There was a plan to enforce mem-
bership controls to eliminate a good
bit of the dead wood that floats
along with so many campus organ-
izations; there was a plan to get
new, interested members, and a

Dean Advocates
5-Year College.

Knoxville, Tenn. (1.P.)—The job
of the modern-day businessman has
become so complex that colleges
and universities may soon have to
add a fifth year of study to meet
business and industry demands for
specialized, yet broadly educated
graduates.

That prediction was voiced here
recently by retiring Dean T, W.
Glocker of the College of Business
Administration of the University of
Tennessee. Dr. Glocker explains
that new and highly specialized
echniques—budgetary control, time
studies, quality control, and others
—have become modern business es-
sentials.” In addition to these
mounting internal factors, he adds,
today’s business is increasingly af-
fected by conditions in the country
as a whole, by governmental action,
and even by the foreign situation.

In order to prepare college stu-
dents for this complex calling, busi-
ness training institutions already
have intensified their programs,
says the veteran educator. But as
the complexities increase, something
in the present four-year training
program will have to “give,” he as-
serts,

Dr. Glocker believes that the best.
answer, rather than cut down on
the amount or quality of present
offerings, lies in the addition of an-
other year of training. He says it
would be a “grave mistake” to cur-
tail “basic subjects such as liberal
arts courses needed for a better un-
derstanding of science, good citizen-
ship, and our changing civiliza-
tion.”

however are manifestly included for
the purpose of stimulating thought,
and of checking up on the status
quo. We are not interested in tear-
ing down the status quo for the
sake of tearing it down, but we feel
that this student body is long over-
due a justifying of the status quo.
If we don’t know why we act and
believe as we do, we have made a
mockery of man’s most precious
ossession, the thinking mind. We
do not feel that God gave us minds
and self-consciousness unless a dy-
namic growth were intended. If the
status quo cannot be justified, it
must be changed. This point can-
not be overemphasized. We are un-
der the moral law of the universe
to promote goodness, beauty, and
truth to our utmost.

I will content myself this week
with a simple statement of the pro-
gram. Next week, and during the
rest of this year, each topic will be
discussed ip detail in the David-
sonian,

changeover from Hell Week to

been started. We are working

third plan to get some overall
constructivity done in a field which
needs the competence of well-in-
formed, active leaders, now as never
before.. ”

The trouble which affects entire-
ly too many of our local organiza-
tions, seems to affect IRC also—
there are too few people doing too
many things, and conversely, too
many people doing absolutely noth-
ing. They go to class, to the board-
ing houses, to fraternity meetings,
study a little, and live the rest of
their lives completely disconnected
from the campus; at the movies in
Charlotte, Mooresville, ete.—any of
a dozen places but here at David-
son taking an active interest in
what goes on in the college com-
munity, and making their contribu-
tion to campus life. This attitude of
inertia foil not only the higher as-
pirations of IRC, but many other
campus organizations as well.

Let's be idealists, now for a min-
ute, and imagine an active and ef-
fective IRC. At least every two
weeks it would publish in The

Davidsonian a notice concerning

DICK ROPER:

the problem to be taken up at the
next meeting and invite interested
students to attend. At feast once
a month it would hold a panel
discussion, a debate, or invite in
an outside speaker to dis-
cuss particular aspects of interna-
tional relations problems. At least
once a semester it would sponsor
a chapel program to present world
problems, and make an attempt—
although, with the indifference
prevalent among us, I dare say, it
would be futile—an attempt, at
least to create an active interest
among students concerning world
affairs, so that when their time
comes to take over their responsi-
bilities as world citizens they might
have some idea of what that re-
sponsibility entails.

The challenge is clear: IRC, if it
is to deserve the name and posi-
tion it sometimes claims, should be-
come an active, growing, interest
drawing organization, with its basic
principle the theme that through
knowledge of the world today we
may be better prepared to live in

the world of tomorrow,

MacArthur’s Aide Flays Press,
Leaves Self Open For Criticism

The trials and tribulations of Gen-
eral Douglas MacArthur have been
brought back into the public eye
in the past few days via an article
in the December issue of Cosmo-
politan magazine, written by Mac-
Arthur's chief of intelligence dur-
ing the Korean war. The article ac-
cuses biased newspaper report of
causing the split between Wash-
ington and Tokyo (i.c., Truman and
Mac Arthur).

In a lengthy beef which is splat-
tered over several pages of the
periodical, Major General Charles
A, Willoughby in effect accuses
five well-known journalists and
three widely circulated news maga-
zines of being virtually in league
against MacArthur and his ad-
visers. He accuses all of generally
misrepresenting the facts during the
war and of giving “aid and com-
fort to the enemy.”

It would seem that Gen. Willough-
by has lodged a combat boot in his
mouth which may prove difficult
to remove,

One of the newspapermen lam-
basted by Gen. Willoughby is Han-
son W. Baldwin, military analyst
for the New York Times, who
wrote an article which appeared in
the Saturday Evening Post at the
beginning of the Korean War
criticizing the armed forces of the
United States. Baldwin found the
U. S. forces woefully lacking in
many departments. _

Mr. Baldwin's article was a cool,
factual report to the American peo-
ple on how their armed forces
stacked up against those of the
rest of the world. It was written
before the Korean war ever broke

has already been started, with
Bill White working with Col.
Ballard and the ROTC Depart-
ment.

To study the traffic and park-
ing situation in the boarding
house area. A committee has
been sppointed, and is working
with Dean Bailey on this. Some-
thing definite should result in
three or four more weeks.

. To examine the oath that every
full professor of Davidson is re-
quired to take. Two of us are
working on this, and it will be
the subject of the next few
articles.

To create or discover new
cheers and “pep methods” for
football season.

To make a critical analysis of
the student government, the
honor system, and the student
body regulations.

To promote non-segregation in
‘athletics, and such activities as
the lecture and concert series,
and to agitate for the admitting
of a Negro student into the
student body.

To take a long look at the
YMCA set-up on the campus,
with especial reference to com-
pulsory membership.

To draw up some form of a
statement of what the student

3.

out, many months before as a fact
for the record. Mr, Baldwin there-
fore could not have had the Eighth
Army (arm in Korea) specifically
in mind when he wrote the article.

The remainder of Gen. Willough-
by’s article sounds much like the
whining of a bitter old man. He
names such distinguished corre-
spondents as Homer Bigart and
Hal Boyle as aiding and abetting
the “campaign” to discredit the
military authorities in charge in
Korea. Both of these men, each
winners of the Pulitzer prize for
distinguished correspondence, work
for employers who could not afford
to tolerate inaccurate or biased re-
porting. Bigart works for the New
York Herald Tribune, which is
widely regarded as the greatest
newspaper in America today. Boyle
is employed by the Associated
Press, a news service whose ve-
racity is seldom doubted.

Mr. Bigart replied to Gen, Wil-
loughby’s charges in a statement
which anyone who read the papers

back at the beginning of the Ko-

rean war will see to be true:

“General MacArthur and his tight
little circle of advisers have never
been able to stomach criticism,
whether from a war correspondent
or the President of the United
States. In an attempt to silence
criticism, they have adopted the
line that anyone who questions
their judgments is ‘inaccurate,
biased, and prejudiced’ and that any
criticism of them involves some
slur on the whole army.”

General MacArthur was, of
course, fired for exceeding his

academic ideal should be, and
to attempt to re-emphasize what
a college should be for.

10. To study the present cut sys-
tem in comparison with the cut
systems of others schools, espe-
cially double-cuts.

11. To abolish the Court of Con-
trol and the Freshman Regula-
tions.

12, .To obtain more trash cans for
the campus. .

13. To examine the loss of this
thing called school spirit, and
to suggest remedies, such as
more class competition, less in-
tercollegiate sport, etc.

14. To act as hosts for the pros-
pective Baker Scholars who
visit the campus in the spring.

1S. To try to halt the booing of the
referees during the basketball
season.

That is quite a list. It is a list
that any organization could be well
proud to sponsor. If anyone in the
student body or faculty wants to
work on any of these projects,
please see me, and I can promise
you more work than you can
handle.

I received some ten or twelve re-
plies to the letter that was sent out
recently to fifty-six of you, If any-
one’ has anything to suggest to ys,
please see me as soon as possible.
