Poll Rates Current
Rushing Program

By ANDY BLAKE
This week the DAVIDSONIAN, in cooperation with
the IFC, issued questionnaires concerning rush week.
Almost 200 freshmen and upperclassmen replied to the
attempted evaluation of our rush program. The question-
naire included nine direct queries and space for remarks.

‘After assimilation and study
by the DAVIDSONIAN the cam-
pus opinions were turned over
to the IFC for consideration.

Question number one asked,
“Are you in favor of continuing
dorm rushing as it was this
year?” Nearly 150 fraternity
men are. This was defended as
the most effective means of get-
ting to know_rushees,

However, there were com-
plaints about the mobbing of
freshmen halls and camping in

ficient, while a third felt that
twelve would improve the sys-
tem. Of this third, less than
25°: wished to return to after-
noon parties (question 5); the
large majority desiring an addi-
tional night of parties.

Only one student out of five
desired longer rush parties in
answer to question six. Those
wanting longer parties often
mentioned thirty additional
minutes as about right.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

West Praises
Band Practice

“It was the best first rehear-
sal we've ever had,” is the
rating Mr. Frank West ascribed
to the Davidson College bands
under his direction.

With organization nearing
completion, the bands, accord-
ing to Mr. West, have, along
with the experience of the up-
perclassmen. an unusually good
talent in several of its fresh-
men.

The concert band, which this
year started practice two
months earlier than ever be-
fore. is composed of forty mem-
bers who practice in Shearer
Hall from 7:00 until 8:30 on
Monday night and on Thursday
from 4:30 until 6:00 in the aft-
ernoon. The concert band has
been invited to march in the
Carousel parade in Charlotte

i

and is planning a concert for
November 4, featuring Tchai-
kovsky'’s 1812 Overture.

The marching band. a com-
bination of the football and
R.O.T.C. bands, consists of over
fifty sophomores and freshmen.
‘This band marches during drill
period on Tuesday and ‘from
4:30 until 5:30 Friday afternoon
in formation on Richardson
Field.

The Davidson-Citadel. game
on October 4 will bring this
band to the public with per-
haps one other trip to be sched-
uwled other than the home
games at which the band will
entertain. The schedule also in-
cludes playing at the dedica-
ition of the new science building
lon October 2, 1958.

Although these bands are al-
most complete and have a full
schedule well under way, there
is still a need for clarinet play-
ers. Those interested are re-
quested to see Mr. West at the
earliest opportunity,

For Court

On Monday, October 6, the
court will have its first trials.
The following trials will take
place every other Monday
night.

Judge Nix addressed the up-
perclassmen in chapel today,
urging them to support the
Court. “We need to make the
freshmen realize that they are
freshmen. They have been giv-
en the feeling that they are on
a high pedestal,” he said.

He expressed the earnestness
of this year’s Court to do a good
job, but reminded the upper-
classmen that it would only be
as effective as the student body
wished for it to be.

If an upperclassman desires
to bring charges against a
freshman, he should contact a
member of the court and give
him the freshman's name and
the charge. Each member will
keep a supply of charge sheets.

Members of the 1958 Court,
in addition to Nix, are recorder
Pat Henderson, Craig Wall, Har-
old Westervelt, George Hart.
Larry MeNeil, Scott Lacey and
Jerry Cole. They were appoint-
ed by the student council.
