In facing the problem of what saving

that the object of Christianity is not to
produce men just good enough to be saved,
but to have them so feel the dynamic of
Christ’s character that they will live and
grow in His. likeness,

SOCIETIES CONSIDER
CHANGE OF NIGHT

Due to the large proporton of the stu
dent. body having other

meetings on

Thursday night, committees were ap-
pointed by both literary societies to look
into the matter of changing the meeting
night. Irom the Phi Society, Sam Coker,
C. H. Dubose and S. W. Dubose were ap-
pointed, with Graham Long and M, W.
Nortleet from the Eumaneans.

On the program of the Philanthropic
Society, the feature was a debate on the
subject, “Resolved, That uropean Immi-
gration Should be Whplly Restricted for
a period not to Exceed Two Years.” The
affirmative team was composed of R. T.
Elliot and D. F. Helm, who were opposed
by S. W. Dubose and T, H. Hall. A

vote of the house on the merits of the

question was in favor of the affirmative. |

The Eumenean Society departed from
the usual type of program in presenting
a mock trial in which A, N. Brown act-
ed as judge, R. O. Flynn as prosecuting
attorney, M. M. King as defense attorney,
and OQ. B. Long as defendant. The de-
fendant was found guilty and a heavy
sentence was imposed.

AGENTS ARE TO
COLLECT DURING
LIMITED HOURS

According to R. E. Kell, all agents for
dry cleaners and shoe repair shops must
do their collecting between 9:00 and 10:30
o'clock on Monday and Thursday nights.
This regulation is to go into effect im-
mediately.

Many students who have been incon-

studies will be glad to know of this new
regulation,

Now all of the agents will
call at about the same time and the con-
tinual interruptions, which have existed
on Monday and Thursday nights, will be
converted into only one interruption which
will last for only a short while. The
regulation will also be beneficial to the
men who do the collecting. since with
shorter hours men will make it a point to
be in-their rooms at this time if they have
any work to be done.
