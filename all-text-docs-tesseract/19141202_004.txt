SENIOR SPEAKING.

(Concluded from page 1)

tin introduced cach of the speakers with
a few timely remarks. W. A. Mcll-
waine, in his speech on “Organization,”
brought out very forcibly the idea that
there is a dangerous tendency at present
in our organizations for social better-
ment to pay attention to the mere physi-
cal good and not the characters of the
individual men whom it is desired ‘to
help. “Fhe Present Need,” by P. D.
Patrick, showed the pressing need for
the teaching of the Bible in the public
schools, and that this should be a_ vital
part of our educational system. ;

Dr. Lingle was master of ceremonies
on Saturday afternoon, ‘Che Man Be-
hind the Degree,” delivered by F. W.
Price, was perhaps the feature of the
afternoon. “The different educational
ideals of the present and the past were
discussed in a masterful way. A degree
should not be an end in itself, but should
stand for a well-rounded manhood. N.
Johnson, the class president, ended the
exercises with a graceful and witty
speech, in which he thanked those who
had done so much to make the occasion
a success.

Immediately after this the crowd ad-
journed to the gymnasium, where the
championship game in basket. ball was
plaved between the Seniors and Fresh-
men. ;

“PEE GENERAL FRAT RECEPTION.”

A large crowd enjoved the reception
given by the fraternities on the Hill Sat-
urday night. “Vhe halls that were open
were, namely: Kappa Sigma, Kappa
Alpha, Beta ‘Pheta Pi, Sigma Alpha
Eplison, Pi Kappa Alpha, and Pi Kappa
Phi. “Vhe Bachelors Club was open to
visitors also.

‘The couples journeyed from one hall
to another and were weleomed into the
halls by different members of the faculty
and the members of the — fraternities.
Punch and sandwiches were served by
attractive young ladies in the different
halls. “The receptiongTasted until about
12 o'clock and was(Kéédnly appreciated
by all who attended.

The majority of the young lady visit-
ors remained over until Monday and
left on the morning trains amid the uni-
versal wailing of the assembled students.
In fact, so great was the reluctance at
parting that a goodly number of boys
boarded the train and accompanied their
friends part of the way homeward.

GRYPHON RECEPTION,

A pleasant event of the Senior Speak-
ing was the reception given by the Order
of the Gryphon, at their hail on last
Friday evening. Refreshments, consist-
ing of salad, sandwiches, and coffee,
were served by four members of the
Junior class, Messrs. Williams, Finley,
Sparrow, and Morrison, who, disguised
in ludicrous attire, were undergoing a
part of the initiation into the order.

Only members of the order and their
invited ladies were present. They were
Misses Barringer, Johnson, Young,
Duffie, Hadley, Woods, Houston, El-
liott, Wood, Burt, and Dickson; and
Messrs. Carter, Bailey, Van Devanter,
Marsh, Shaw, Rowland. Malloy, Faw,
McDonald, Anderson, Kluttz, and Gil-
christ; and Professor and Mrs. J. M.
McConnell.

The following extract with reference
to the Order of the Gryphon is taken
from the last issue of the Annual:

“An order composed of members of
the Senior class of the college, whose
object it is to draw closer the bonds of
friendship between classmates; to abolish
the differences and misunderstandings
which frequently exist during the first
three years; and to stimulate interest in
the welfare of the college. and do all
that is possible for its upbuilding. It
numbers among its members the leaders
in almost every phase of college life, and
it is the constant aim of these men to
use their influence, both individually
and as a body, for the good of the in-
stitution. A medal is offered each year
by the Gryphon Order for the man
who, in the estimation of. a bodv of
judges, has done most for the college
during his course.”

Forest their touchdown. Billings failed

Davidson o.

Nothing unusual happened in the
third quarter. One of the prettiest plays
of the game was executed, however,
when R. Walker recetved a forward
pass in the midst of several Baptists
which netted Davidson 10 yards. Dav-
idsun kept the ball in her possession most
of the time in this quarter, but was un-
able to cross the well-guarded goal line
of Wake Forest.

The fourth quarter, Davidson “came
hack” with “the old-time pep” and fight
in her eves. During the six minutes of
play in this quarter the ball was always
in’ Davidson's possession, the Red and
Blacks making their required distance
every time. “Phe Baptists weré perfectly
helpless against the awful attack of the
revived Presbyterians. Vhe steady march
down the field was progressing when
Black was given the ball, and ran 35
yards for Davidson’s winning touch-

itive way, that the /<

bears this trade-
mark, whether it
be FOOTBALL,
BASKET BALL, INDOO!

or any other athletic game ?

There Must be a reason for this
universal adoption by the lead-
ing organizations connected with
sports, and there is s reason—no
one can make them as good.

The same argument applies to
all things athletic.
