Presentation

Discover a whole new world of poetry, art, and music

By Laura LEIBFREID
Staff writer

Have you ever wondered
about the identity of one curious
Indian man, riding his bright green
bicycle up and down Concord
Road? If so, I am proud to intro-
duce Davidson’s very own Nirmal
Selvamony, a Visiting Scholar this
year from Madras Christian Col-
lege. Professor Selvamony col-
laborated with Professor Stasack
of the Music Department in devel-
oping a plan to explore a cross-
cultural musical interpretation of
five short Indian songs he wrote
based on ancient Tamil poems.
These poems will be performed
within a larger presentation of in-
ternational poetry, music, and art
Friday, March 31, at 8 p.m. in
Hodson Hall.

Each of the Tamil poems de-
scribes a different ecological liv-

ing space: seacoast, riverine plains,
desert, scrub jungle, and moun-
tains. According to aged Tamil
belief, these five regions possess
their very own musical scale, or
“pan” (pronounced “pun’’), which
is used to reflect a distinct human
behavior oremotion. Forexample,
the scrub jungle pan reveals amood
of patient waiting and domestic
peace. ¢

Using the pan as a starting
point, four musicians, including
Davidson alum Thavagunan
Mahadevan, have broadened
Selvamony’s style to incorporate
the instruments and tones of other
cultures. Their performance will
involve everything from South and
North Indian drums to the Korean
kayageum.

Other poetry examining man’s
relationship to nature will be pre-
sented in the program by Dr. Gill
Holland and two international stu-

dents, Jung Ah Shin and Thomas
Wang. Their readings will include
Chinese, Native American, and
Korean poetry.

Beyond the collaboration of
music and poetry, Cort Savage’s
sculpture, “Myths of Rationality,”
composed of thousands of glass
lantern slides, will be reconfigured
to add arich visual backdrop to the
event. His piece, first constructed
in 1992-93, displays a wide spec-
trum of art and architectural im-
ages, expanding space and time.
In addition, Ronnie Higdon’s in-
novative lighting will illuminate
the sculpture and enhance the vary-
ing moods of the five eco-regions
as we travel through them over the
course of the performance.

All in all the evening prom-
ises to be unforgettable. Your
support and interest in an interna-
tional collaboration of the arts will
be greatly appreciated.

bored men in cowboy hats preside
over a heap of junk-shop artifacts
which includes small statues of
Lenin. Here history is reduced to
kitsch, and nobody seems to care.

With few exceptions, the
paintings in the show are haunting,
furious, and nearly terrifying. The
horrors of barbarity and indiffer-
ence are mitigated only by irony;
the misuses and abuses of history
are exposed here and allowed, in
their bareness, to speak for them-
selves.

The paintings lay bare histori-
cal fallacies and the aesthetic fal-
lacy that successful art cannot or
should not be socially engaged.
Mesches understands and makes
use of the fact that presenting the
dulled and rusted axe of political
activism can be as effective a way
of making a point as grinding and
wielding that axe.
