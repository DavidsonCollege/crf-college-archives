“SINT AN

HELP!

‘The journalism handbook didn't
help one-bit - in fact, it was
dowmmright disheartening. No topic
entitled, "How to Be an Editor."
Roget's Thesaurus didn't even list
the word “editor”, this inferring
that an editor is beyond descrip-
tion. Neither was the title found
in Bartlett's Quotations nor in
the "Oedipus Rex" of Sophocles.

So in desperation we prostrated
ourselves at tho feet of lest
year's editor of Davidson's SUMMER
SCHOOL newspaper, then humbly
sought guidance.

Know what he said? "Write what
ever you want to, print it, and to
heck with the rest of the world."

With this thought in mind, we
bring to you the maiderl issue of
the BOBTAIL D*VIDSONTIAI. Throvph-
out the summer this "rug" will
intermittently be placed in your
sweaty palms for your perusal.

It will contain news oF past. ond
coming everts, some feutures (such
aa the Raving Reporter and Brice
on Bridge), end will be sprinkled
with a generous amount of (we hope
sincerely) humor.

Ve still need nelv. Your help.
If you heve ony helpful sugges-
tions to make, any news thot's fit
to print, or, most important, any
time to spare and en interest in
putting out a wildcat newspaper,
contact one of tne members of our
very minute staff.

And will we bo glad to see yous

RAVING REPORTER

QUESTION OF THE “23K:
‘mat is your honest
opinion of SUMMER SCHOOL? -_

Bob Shoffner: I wish
everybody could come up here
to see the difference between
SUMMER SCHOOL and the regular
somester. “TE have concentra-
ted courses and more leisure
time. Hey, see that cute
chick crossing the campus? ’

Henry Trinp: After nine
months, three more can't make much
difference.

Tom Anderson: I like it, be-
cause we don't have but one course
et a time, end ve cen study better
for it.

‘elcolm Doty: SUMHER SCHOOL?

Don .Buckley: These science
courses are too intonsified.

Joe Chendler: ‘What teés me off,
you Imow, is these guys that got
three hour classes in the morning,
you Imow, while I gcttea stay in
lab all afternoon. You Imow?

Bruce “ilder: Don't bother me,
son. I'm busy counting my money!

, sqhiFlirst, shuffle the cards well
(8ti ck thom, too, if you get a
chance). Next, cut them to the
doaler, trying to see the card on
the dottom. If you're deoling,
elyays look at the bottom card, so
you can give it to someone else if
you so desire,

When all the cards are dealt,
and you note thet you do not have
co bidaile hand (and your partner
has a sod e:mression on nis fece),
quickly sey, "It's ¢ misdeal; I
have only twelve cardsé" You and
your partner shotld throw your hands
dowm with dispatch. Speed is nec-
ossary, if this procedure is to be
successful; a redoal usually re-
sulvs when it is properly executed.

Next, we shall assume that you
do have @ bideble hend. The fine
points of bidding will be discussod
in next week's odition of SOBTAIL
DAVIDSONTAN. & ow 4
