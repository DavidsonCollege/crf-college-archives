+ Honor System

In response to the question, “How do you
think the Honor System could be made more ef-
fective?” these students said:

WITHROW

Jerry Withrow, sophomore: By not
having any punishments that are over-
ly strict, the effectiveness of the honor
system would be improved. As it
stands now. few students will turn in
their classmates because they feel the
punishments are far too rigorous for
the offenses.

Randy Bridges, junior: The Honor
system's effectiveness can best be im-
proved on the college admissions level.
The college should get students who
put more value in honor.

BRIDGES
° Duncan Postma, freshman: The

honor system. needs to be impressed
more upon incoming students. « All
students here signed the statement to
obey the honor system. and if they
find that they can no longer agree
with it they should not remain, at Da-
vidson.

POSTMA

Ken France, freshman: The profes-
sors need to explain what they expect
of the students. This is especially true
in lab where you are supposed to help
your partner. but are not supposed to

help him with the answers. In such a

situation, it is very difficult to keep

from inadvertently breaking the honor . '

Sie Davttscnion ROTC AT DAVIDSON

Required Status Continues:

Despite Changed Form

By JIM COOLEY
Associate Editor

With approval last week by
the Board of Trustees of the
recommendation of their Ed-
ucation Committee, the con-
tinued status of ROTC as a
required course at Davidson
was assured.

The program will continue
to be organized along the
same lines as previously, al-
though the format will be al-
tered to meet requirements
of the new curriculum.

The only basic change is
the addition of another ex-
emption—a statement by en.
tering freshmen’s parents—
to those already existing
which allow waiving the re-

quirements concerning. RO-
TC.

The only question remain.
ing concerns the acceptance
of the revision by the De-
partment of Defense. The
school’s contract will have to
be amended to include the
exemption.

It is hoped that the con.
tract will not need to be re-
negotiated. In that event, the
ROTC program must con-
tinue as presently organized
for another year because the
contract calls for a year’s
notice before renegotiation.

Col. Frederick B. Outlaw,
professor of military science,
indicated that he thought the
Department of Defense would

able request. This recom-
mendation."’ he added, “‘of-
fers the possibility of con-
tinuing a viable program at
‘Davidson under proper im-
plementation of the exemp-
tion policy."

The amotit of academic
credit granted under the pro-
gram, despite recommenda-
tions by the Blue Sky Com-
mittee. remains unchanged.

Under the new curriculum.
one course credit will be giv-
en for the basic program.
and two for the advanced
_program.

Students who take the ad.
vanced program will take 33
courses during their four
years while non ROTC stu.
dents will take only 32.

This puts Davidson at al-
most the national average
for the amount of credit giv-
en to ROTC, according to
Outlaw.

If the amendment to the
contract is approved, next
year's ROTC. schedule will
call for drill in the fall and
spring terms and for classes
in all three terms. There wili
be no drill during the winter
term.

FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA

This column, normally a treasure house of.twinkly quips
and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your
campus newspaper for fourteen. years, and if I haye
learned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to
try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With
final exams looming obscenely close, you don’t want jokes;
you want help.

So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram
course in the subject you are all flunking. I refer, of
course, to biology.

Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First
is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be
taught simple things like bringing in the newspaper, but
when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with
at least two cells, or even four if your yard has a fence
around it.

Another popular class of animals is the periphera—a
shadowy category that borders often on the vegetable.
Take, for example, the sponge. The sponge is definitely an
animal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is definitely not.

Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people
find insects unattractive, but actually there is exquisite

sbeauty inthe insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for
instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos—Tumbling Along with the Tumbling Tumblebug
and Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid and Gnats My Mother
Caught Me. Mr. Sigafoos, alas, has been inactive since the
invention of DDT. .

Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projec-
tions on the ocean bottom. Shrimps are generally found in
a circle around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless
Steel Blades are sold.

I mention Personna Blades because the makers éf Per-
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are
inclined to get edgy if I neglect to mention their product.
Some get double edgy and some single, for Personna
Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style.

Mind you, it is no burden for me to mention Personia,
for it is a blade that shaves quickly and cleanly, slickly and
keenly, scratchlessly and matchlessly. It is a distinct pleas- .

ure to shave with Personna Blades and to write about
them but sometimes, I confess, I find it difficult to work
the commercial into a column. Somé-years ago, for ex-
ample, I had the devil's own time working a Personna plug
into a column about Alexander the Great. The way I finally
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle at
Delphi, “Oracle, I have tasted all the world’s pleasures,
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I have
missed.” To which the Oracle replied, ‘Yes, Alexander,
there is such a joy—namely Personna Blades—but, alas for
ou, they will not be invented for another 2500 years.
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a fit of weeping that
Zeus finally took pity and turned him into a hydrant...
Well sir, there is no question I sold a lot of Personnas with
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the
American Academy of Arts and Letters gave me a mighty
d razzing, you may be sure.
out I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced
phyllum of all—the chordata, or vertebrates. There are
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbones
and those with horizontal. Genetally it is easy, to tell the
apart. A fish, for instance, has a horizontal backbone, an

a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you rin.into

a fish that swims upright or a mon who never gets out of

the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science'struggied

with this sticky question for yeare before Sigafoos of

M.I.T came up with his brilliant solution: offer the crea-

ture a pack of Personna Blades. If it is a fish, it will refuse.

If it is homo sapiens, it will accept—and the more sapient,

the quicker. -o.

And now you know biology. And now, for the fourteenth
time, aloha.

ee @ sient blade,

The makers of Personna, The Electro-Coated blade,

have enjoyed bringing you another year of Old Max.

From us too, aloha. ’ .
