Ed Armfield was the oustanding
performer of the game. His 95
yard (or was it 100 yards?) gallop
through the entire Furman team for
the second was the most brilliant
single play of the whole fray. King
had been booting the kick-offs out
of the end zone consistently, but on
the occasion (after Furman’s second
touchdown) he kicked somewhere
between the goal and the 5-d. line.
Here Ed gathered in the twirling
pigskin, hesitated a minute to set

under full Furman
goal 95 yards distant. Splitting the
middle to midfield, Ed veered to his
left and sped down the sidelines.
He picked up Dave Warden out in
front, and Dave blocked the closest
pursuer. A Furman_ man. caught
Armfield on the 5-yard line, but Ed
