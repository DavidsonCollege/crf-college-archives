Cabaret Scene Proves Brilliant Climax
to Joyous Festivities of Junior Week

Beautiful Decorative Effects Add
Beauty to the Occasion

The entertainment for Saturday night of
Junior Speaking has always been in charge
of the Junior class, and this year the class
Mt ‘27 provided an original and udusually
good program at the gym. The gym has
never been so well decorated. In the center
was a large lighted dome from which crepe
streamers in orange and black were stretch-
ed to the side walls and from there to the
floor. The room was specially wired for the
occasion so that there were several lighting
effects for different parts of the program.
The entrance to the building was also deco-
rated. with bright lights and signs, and a
special latticed entrance.

The entertainment was one that has never
been given here before,
French cabaret with its
tango dancing. The gym was filled with
tables, and excellent refreshments were
served to the guests by the members of the
Junior class btween the different parts of
the program. The Glee Club orchestra, “the
Davidsonians,” furnished most of the music
during the evening, but the musical part of
the program was varied by numbers by the
mandolin and guitar club and the quartet.

The feature of the program was a Spanish
tango dance by Mis Lucy Heath, of Char-
lotte, and Mr. Jim Price, formerly of Mont-
lgomery, Ala. The music by the Glee Club
orchestra and a saxaphone solo by “Tootie”
Crayton, accompanied by P. B. Frye, drew
lots of applause, as did also the Mandolin and
Guitar club. The quartet, composed of W. O.
Green, D. G. Wilson, J. S. Foster, and D.
M. Calhoun, sang from time to time during
the evening, and “The Song Without a
Name” by them, in which Bill Green’s yodel-

Officers Elected
by Rising Seniors

Senior class elections, held during the past
two weeks, have resulted in the choice of
various members of the present junior class
to offices of honor for next year. The elec-
tion of Joe McConnell, of Davidson, N. C.,
to the class presidency of the rising senior
class was announced in a recent issue of The
Davidsonion, but since that time the members

For the office of vice-president, there were
a number of nominations, but when the final
ballot was cast and counted, Harry G. Goody-
koontz, of Bluefield, W. Va., was declared
‘winner, with W. T. Covington as runner-up.
Goodykoontz has been prominent in various
class and activities entering
Davidson. Winning notice by his work ‘on
the athletic field during his freshman year,
and continuing -his athletic accomplishments
on through two successful seasons’ on the
track and on the basketball court, Harry has
now reached an enviable position among the
leading Davidson athletds. As secretary of
the Y. M. C. A. this year, he has taken an
outstanding part in the religious activities
on the campus.

Tom Anderson, Bristol, Tenn., was
declared secretary of the rising senior class
after two ballots had eliminated all other
candidates. His closest rival for the position
was Ronald Wilson, of Charleston, W. Va.
Anderson is a letter man in basketball and is
also a contender for honors on the cinder
path. He has taken a prominent part in
various class activities.

“Purity Number,” and a number of the
illustrations and jokes printed within its

covers carried out the idea of this unique
title. The magazine was practically free
from all jokes and puns of a vulgar or sug-
gestive nature, and its pages were not bur-
dened with offensive personal references.

A four-color cover design, the work of
Miss Alberta Austin, of Mobile, Ala., added
a touch of color and beauty to the magazine.
The cover was an artistic representation of
a Spanish maiden, strumming the cords of a
guitar, and the background eftects added
vividness to the main figures by contrast.

Illustrations by numerous students were
carried at appropriate intervals within the
pages, and all material was arranged in an
