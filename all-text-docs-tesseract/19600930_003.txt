while, Coach Dole has robbed his defensive unit of three
key men and another, end Booker Clark, a co-captain,
probably will not play tomorrow because of a shoulder
injury.

THE REASON, of ‘course, for Dole’s move is to jack
up his offeusive attack, which collapsed like a card table
at Wofford. His new, strategy shows sophomore Kent
Tucker at quarterback, Jerry Sheffield at halfback and
David Lovette at guard.

” Earlier in the week, it was

lost another member of his fine

By CARL RUST

Sports Writer

Sophomore quarterback Kent Tucker will be call-

ing the plays tomorrow when Davidson meets The Citadel
at 2:30 p. m. on Richardson Field. Disappointed by last
week’s 6-0 loss to Wofford, Coach Bill Dole has also call-
ed upon Jerry Sheffield, Alex Gibbs and Bob McAl-
lister to start in the offensive backfield.
