INDEPENDENT TIUNKING,

Soon our defenseless heads will be
showered with theories, reform meas-
ures, culogies, prophecies, solutions of
world problems and all those classes of
subjects which make ideal Junior
speeches. At such a time we cannot help
but try to guess how much of the speak-
er’s real self goes into his message, how
much indepedent thinking has followed
the necessary study of the subject.

It is so easy, if our minds are built
that way; to accept a statement, simply
because we see it in print or because we
have heard someone make it. To ques-
tion it would require that some time
very difficult operation, the unnecessary
use of the mind. Or it may be, we are
in the habit of always disagrecing—to
immediately take the opposite side and
refuse to be shaken from our position by
any outside force. We think that this
is one of the most common characteris-
tics of a small calibre man.

In neither of these two common types
of minds do we find much independence
of thought. Both follow blindly a habit
of mind and refuse to bring into the sub-
ject the personal element.

It might be well, when the speakers
are running over their speeches for the
last time, or when the listeners hear
these masterpieces by the followers of
Demosthenes, that they pause and ask
themselves the question, “What do !
think about this matter?”

THOUGHTLESSN ESS.

At Davidson, where the keynote of
our life is a friendly and helpful feeling
for our neighbor, we are sure that only
thoughtlessness could be responsible for
the sometimes just complaint which has
been made about the order during the
speaking exercises. A whispered con-
versation. a laugh at the wrong moment.
leaving the hall during a speech—all
these are small things, but they mav
cause even an experienced speaker much
difficulty. Let us all help, and not
hinder, the class whose guest we are
for these three days.
