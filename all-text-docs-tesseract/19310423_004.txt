Davidson Alumni Will
Meet in Richmond, Va.

Dr. C. M. Richards Will Address
Body as Faculty Representative
—Large Group Located There

Over seventy-five Davidson College alumni,
residing in Richmond, Petersburg and Wood-
berry Forest, have been invited to a dinner-
meeting of the Richmond local chapter next
Friday night at 7 9’clock, which will be given
at Union Theological Seminary, Richmond.
Dr. C. M. Richards, member of the David-
son College faculty, «will represent the col-
lege and make an address to the alumni.

It was originally planned to have a meet-
ing of this chapter early in April, but due
to conflicting dates it was necessary to post-
pone it. A particular effort was made to have
it before the graduation exercises of Union
Seminary, where so many Davidson men are
students, and satisfactory arrangements were
made through Rev. D. T. Caldwell, 714, of
Petersburg, Va., president of the chapter.
He co-operated with authorities at Union
Seminary. Rev. Geo. C. Bellingrath, ’18, is
secretary of the club.

Next to the meeting of the New York
chapter, the attendance of the Richmond or-
ganization is largest. Not only are many of
the Seminary students alurani of Davidson,
but several members of the faculty of the
Seminary are likewise graduates of this in-
stitution. Approximately 30 other alumni are
located in Richmond in various capacities.

This will probably be the last local chap-
ter meeting of the present scholastic session.
In all likelihood an attempt will be made
to get the Davidson alumni together at the
annual meeting of the Southern Presbyterian
General Assembly at, Montreat, which ses-
sions begin May 28. However, this meeting
will have alumni attending from all over the
South, similar to that at the World Congress
at Chattanooga in February.

Dr. FE. S. Avery, ’25, who has been prac-
ticing medicine at Maiden, N. C., has been
elected to and has accepted the post of as-
sistant superintendent of the Forsyth Tuber-
culosis Hospital, at Winston-Salem.
