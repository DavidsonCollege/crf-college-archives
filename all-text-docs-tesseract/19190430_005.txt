“Murray, of the State College, and
Clarke, of Davidson, are without doubt
two of the best college heavers in North
Carolina this season. In the same class,
however, are Southard, of Trinity, and
Powell, of the University. Any college
team with these four twirlers would lose
only a few games in four years time.” —
News and Observer.

SECOND GAME.

Both teams were decidedly weakened
by the hard work of the day before ‘and
the game was very loosely played. Bur-
rus, the invincible southpaw who
cently held Davidson to one safety, was
again on the job, and although poorly
supported, kept his hits sufficiently scat-
tered to stay in the lead. Currie was
hit hard and often and was not given
the proper support. “Phe Presbyterians
had ample opportunity to score but  in-
ability to hit at the proper time al-
lowed ten men to perish on the sacks.

The lucky seventh was the only in-
ning in w ‘hich the timely hit: was pro-
duced when it counted. Pressley
dropped Ratchford’s fly to left field.
Johnston and Currie were unable to
connect. Spann walked. Miller drove
one to the bank, bringing Ratchford in
and landing Spann at third. Cassell
followed with another clout for half the
and Miller

re-

circuit, bringing Spann
across,

W. Johnson, the Tech catcher, wield-
ed a hefty stick, poling out two doubles

and one single out of four appearances

at the plate.
