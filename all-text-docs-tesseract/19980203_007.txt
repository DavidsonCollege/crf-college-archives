_ The First Annual Outpost Talent Show

Attention All Students !!

Between now and February 6™, the Residence Life Office would like all students to check to make sure that their class
status is correct. Lottery numbers are based upon class status and not upon class year, thus it is imperative for students
to check the class rosters that will be posted outside the Registrar’s Office, by the Union Desk, in the Library, or in the
Residence Life Office, for any errors that may be present. It should be noted, that some students may have enough credits
to warrant a different class status.

EXAMPLE:
Name Class Status Class Year
Smith, John , SOPH 00

ALL CoRRECTIONS SHOULD BE MADE PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 6™
