Cornelson Lecturer to Discuss East-
ern European Economic Reform

By Lisa Gerrard
. A specialist on Eastern Euro-
pean and Soviet economic reform
will speak at Davidson College on
Tuesday, March 12) as part of the
Cornelson Distinguished Lecture
Series in Economics.

Morris Bornstein, an econom-
ics professor at the University of
Michigan, will discuss Eastern
European reforms at 8 p.m. in the
Art Gallery of the Chambers build-
ing at Davidson College. The talk
is free and open to the public.

A former consultant for the
World Bank, Bornstein has par-

ticipated in conferences of the
United Nations Economic Com-
mission for Europe, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the International Economic Asso-
ciation. He is an editor for the
journals “Soviet Economy” and
“Problems of Economics.”

Bornstein’s articles on eco-
nomic reform appear in numerous
respected books and journals, but
scholars know him best for his
popular textbook, “Comparative
Economics Systems,” now in its
sixth edition.

“Dr. Bornstein is truly an

eminent specialist on Soviet and
Eastern European economies,” said
Clark Ross, chairman of the
Davidson College economics de-
partment. “He has taught genera-
tions of students the fundamentals
of comparative economic systems
by virtue of his well-known text.”
The Cornelson Family Endow-
ment sponsors Bornstein’s presen-
tation as part of a series of distin-
guished lecturers on economics.
The endowment honors six mem-
bers of the Cornelson family who
studied at Davidson College.

Student Government Associa-
tion presided over their final
meeting on March 5. Doug Jobe
began the discussion of old busi-
ness by thanking Sarah Sadow-
ski and all who participated in the
Gulf Crisis Conference for their
hard work.

Jobe expressed great disap-
pointmentin the general student
apathy on campus and particular
concern fortheimpression it gives
tothe professors. He wondered if
any of them would ever be will-
ing to participate in student ac-
tivities like this again. .

In other old business, Kristi
Kessler talked about final plans
‘for SGA Weekend. The prospec-
tives stayed through Saturday,
March 9 and appeared to have a
good time.

The first item of new busi-
ness was a report by Laura Cun-
ningham, chairman of the Char-
tersand Bylaws Committee. The
SGA passed the motion torenew
|_ previous charters and passed the
proposals for two new charters,
the Student Health Options Com-
mittee -and the Spanish Club. Stu-
dents interested in getting in-
volved in SHOC should contact
David Wright, David Tonidan-
del, and Jennifer Humphries.

Sue Ross, registrar,-has sug-
gested that the daily and weekly
schedule be changed to start
classes at 8:30 each day. The
main loss would be the 11th hour

the benefits would be more time
for arts rehearsal and labs. Dr.
Rossalso feels that starting classes
later would encourage more fac-
ulty to offer ‘morning classes and
more students to take them.
Doug Jobe said his final words
as president, mentioning the need
for the SGA to pull together to
help make Davidsona better place
not just for the students now, but
for those in the years to come. He
then made motions recognizing
the work of Kristi Kessleras vice-
president and Lori Rockett as
chancellor, and each received the
traditional gold Cross pen with
the Davidson seal. Kristi made a
motion recognizing the work done

by Doug Jobe as president, then | .

presented him with the traditional
Davidson captain’s chair.

The final event of the meet-
ing was the swearing-in of the
new presidentand vice-president,
Cammie Covington and Laura
Cunningham. Cammie addressed
‘the SGA and outlined afew of her
expectations for the rest of the
year. She then presented a plaque
to Doug and adjourned the meet-
ing until next Tuesday.

blood at a blood drive. There will
be some paperwork to fill out, but
only a small sample of blood will

successful drive, and we would ap-
preciate your participation. If you

Adami Desire’a Peaceful Solution

By John Wilson

Steven J. Baggarly ‘87 received
a six month probation and a $10
dollar fine for demonstrating
against the war without a permit in
front of the White House on Dec.
30.
Baggarly manages a Norfolk
shelter forthe homeless. The shel-
ter accounts for one of the sixty
existing shelters around the na-
tion. As a Catholic Worker Bag-
garly does. various forms of resis-
tance work. :

Baggarly commented on the
actions that led to his arrest: “There
were eight of us protesting against
the war. I held a sign that read
“Love Your Enemy-Jesus’...We
simply wanted people to reach for
a different solution than fighting.”

Working along with Baggarly
ishis wife Kimberly Williams ‘87.
Together the two run the shelter
for the homeless. “We want to in-
vite those individuals from the
streets into the house who are not

accepted by the general ple,
Baggarly said.

Besides demonstrating against
the war, Mr. and Mrs. Baggarly
also have protested against the
death penalty. These protests occur
in Norfolk, VA, home of ten mili-
tary bases. Baggarly explained
how the people usually react to his
demonstrations: “Verbal hostility
was common from the people.
However, we continued to demon-
strate every morning until the very
end of the war.”

The reasoning behind Bag-
garly’s actions entail a full com-
mitment to the words of Jesus.
Baggarly explained: “We believe
all people are family. We have to
love our enemies... Violence is not
a means to achieve a goal.

“Only love can transform, not
brutal force.” False peace comes
with brutal force. When forcing a
change, the spirit does not change.
In such situations we need to con-

front ourselves then look within
ourselves,

“This is why I am working in
this house. In my eyes everyone is
the same. I want to help bring
those people in that need a lift that
society cannot give. I surely don’t
do it for the money.”

For philosophical reasons the
house runs purely on donations.
The first Catholic Worker house
began in 1933. Ever since then the
houses have been run in a family
fashion; everything is shared.

Baggarly sums up his role as a
Catholic Worker: “We act as dis-
ciples trying to make society the
way Jesus envisioned it. Our goal
is to bring everyone who wants to
listen the message that our ene-
mies, who we try tokill, can be our
friends. If that is not enough justi-
fication then why did we support
Iraq during the Iraq-Iran War, then
destroy Iraq? Loving your enemy
is the only answer.”
