Blue Ridge Swimming Poot

eee ee

ON TO BLUE RIDGE.

Back on a mountain side, affording a
magnificent view of the Seven Sisters of
the Blue Ridge, is situated the large and
well-equipped main building of the Y.
M. C. A. conference grounds, Robert
E. Lee Hall. At thhis place many stu-
dents from colleges all over the South
gather to learn of conditions elsewhere,
to engage in discussions concerning time-
ly topics and to have a general good time
in every way possible.

Robert E. Lee Hall is situated just
three miles south of Black Mountain,
and together with other buildings in the
grounds affords to the visitor who goes
there the comfort of a hotel, or of a
genuine summer camping trip and ath-
letic privileges in the use of the tennis
courts, swimming pool, baseball fields
and other equipment in the athletic line.
Mountain hikes are frequent to Grey-
beard, Pinnacle, Mt. Mitchell and other
places of interest in the neighborhood.
Only a meager impression of what it
really is can be obtained from the above
picture.

But greatest of all the privileges is
the association with the greatest men in
the religious world that the great Y. M.
C. A. organizations represent. Such men
as John R. Mott, Robert E. Speer, Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan and Dr. W. D.
Weatherford have been there and all
have given their opinions in favor of it
as the best thing of its kind around here.
Think over it! If these men are’ not
there, there will be some to take their
places. Get ready! June 12-21.

Definite information can be secured
from any officer of the Y. M. C. A.,
and if you will count the cost you will
find that you will get full value for
every penny you put into it and, by the
way, it does not take such an awful lot
of pennies to go and have a good time,
either. Ten days of pleasure and in-
spiration! What about having a large
Davidson delegation. It pays, collect-
ively and individually.

ALL-STARS DEFEAT
CRACK JUNIOR TEAM

In a hotly contested game a picked
team (All-Stars) defeated the Junior
class team on last Saturday morning by
the score of 6 to 5.

The All-Stars were unable to do any-
thing with Lawson's delivery, backed
with his strong infield; and it was not
until the eighth inning, when Black
went in the box, were they able to get
the pill thru the infield to do any harm.
Four runs were netted in this frame,
which tied the score, and the winning
run was made in the ninth, The Juniors
were unable to land but few hits off

Ormand, and but for several errors the
Junior’s scoring would have been con-
siderably less.

The Junior team worked beautifully,
especially the infield, handling many
chances with but one or two errors. Five
anembers of the infield were “D” men.
This speaks well for the Junior class.
Khe All-Stars worked well only in
spots.

The line-ups of the two wears were:

ALL-STARS, POSITION, JUNIORS.
Keesler.......... C...... Saunders
Ormand......... P . . Lawson, Black
McArn......... 1B..... Hengeveld
Johnson......... 2B......6- Pharr
Dean........... 3B... Black, Lawson

UNCLE EBEN’S LETTER.

Sometimes I think I hear you say
How slow you've been to write,
But jest remember how it am
For now's the time to fight.

Least that’s the way it peers to me
From all this military,

Jest fixing all these nice young men
Right for the cemetery.

“But jump right in for here’s your
chance
To win this bloody fight,
We need right now the best you've got

Its capacity will be:

To scrap with all your might,

WORK ON THE TANK
PROGRESSING FINE

“The enemy is pressing hard,
We've stood it all we kin,

And now that we must do the job
Come help us to begin.” '

This is what they sed to me,
And you jes bet your life

I done forgot to write you, sis,
From thinking on the strife.

So here I go to do my best,
No matter what they say,
For they won’t dare to turn me down
Case I'll go any way.
R. E. M. '19.

To our Suits for Young Men

Work on the tank has been rapidly
cafried on the past week. The riviting
of the huge iron belts on the frame of
the tank proper, begun last weck, will
continue for several days. Scaffolds
were early erected near the top of the
steel supports under the bowl of the
tank. This has been the seat of work.
From early morning till night the regu-
lar tapping of the hammers on the iron
belts has indicated the progress that is
