not entitled to representation at
faculty meetings.

Some maintained that the
presence of students at faculty
meetings would have an
inhibiting effect on discussions.
A number of professors stated
that students would not find
participation at faculty
meetings ‘‘worthwhile or
productive."’

Still others favored some kind
of student input in campus
governance but thought that the
input should be at the com-
mittee level.

Many faculty members con-
ceded that students had a role to
play in campus governance, but
it seems unlikely today that
they will approve a college
assembly on which students will
be able to vote or even listen on
matters of educational policy,
curriculum, or salaries.

Even among professors who
favored the college assembly
format, a majority indicated
that there should be provision
for closed meetings under
some circumstances.

In response to the question
‘Should students vote in a
faculty assembly except in
faculty personnel policy mat-
ters?"’, 10 said that students
should be allowed to vote and 12
said that they should not. Six of-
fered no comment.

Some faculty members ob-
served that students are
already serving on standing
committees where very sen-
sative matters are regularly
discussed.

Students are already passing
judgement on details of the
curriculum, the calendar, and
on governance’ Currently
salaries are decided outside the
faculty meeting, as are per-
sonnel situations involving in-
dividual faculty members.

Faculty members in favor of
student participation asked
repeatedly why students should
be restricted from larger
meetings of the faculty when
they are already being
represented in committees,
‘where the real power lies.”’

Fifty-two professors were
asked ‘Should the faculty elect a
chairman pro-tempore?"’ Four-
teen said yes, 13 no, and 25 an-
swered no comment. The lat-
ter response was due largely to
lack of knowledge concerning
the functions of such an office.

Those responding’ af-
firmatively saw a need for a
faculty representative to speak
for the faculty, while others
thought the office was un-

necessary as present means of
communication were adequate.

The lack of knowledge on this
issue in perhaps the most
significant finding of this area
of the poll.

Overall, the faculty displayed
only a degree of sympathy to
students, although in a sense
these two groups are allies;
both groups seeking a larger
role in céllege ‘governance.

The poll on student in-
volvement in faculty meetings
shows students still face con-
siderable opposition in even at-
greater opposition in voting.

But this determination of the
faculty to control what they see

timents known. He did say,
however, that the work of the
committees might obviate the
necessity of the requirement.

Certainly, many of those in
the committees clearly do not
believe the restriction is
necessary. ‘‘If this is what
provides definition to our com-
munity, we've missed the
boat,"’ Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan said. ‘‘I don’t think the
church of God needs such a
regulation to protect it.”

How to determine who is a
Christian and who is an ‘active
member" is a _ problem for
Bevan, whose job includes
hiring faculty members. For in-
stance, a Unitarian is not con-
sidered a Christian under the
By-laws.

McKelway insists that the
requirement is a misuse of
Christian confession anyway.
“The Christian man is not
called to a life of pious
isolation,’ he said,‘‘but is both
freed and challenged to par-
tucipate in the world of men and
ideas openly and fearlessly.”

Minister to Students W. Rush
Otey III expressed a similar

NC-PIRG Gives 210 Refunds

By JOHN TATUM
Staff Writer

The North Carolina Public In-
terest Group (NC-PIRG) has
refunded the $3 fee funding the
program to 210 students over
the past week.

The fee, which was included
in the comprehensive fee
presented to students, is used to
finance operations of the four
college NC-PIRG. The other
schools involved in the program

are Duke, St. Andrews and
Wake Forest.
Andy Lamas, one of the

organizers of Davidson's PIRG
chapter, said he felt student

BS Reaction from students who

received refunds reflected

as their own house is tempered
by the belief that students do
have a contribution to make and
that some mechanism to insure
student input is needed.

The Faculty Assembly poll is
more disappointing. The con-
cept of an assembly system is
shared authority through the
assembly, yet many professors
do not believe that students
should even attend, although
some of these answers were
meant to show disfavor of an
assembly system.

opinion, citing John Calvin, who
urged Christians to “learn from
that light of truth which is ad-
mirably displayed’’ in the
works of ‘‘heathens.”’

Any man who sincerely seeks
the truth should not be
eliminated because of such a
requirement, Otey said.

Seniors Allan Ware, a mem-
ber of the Faculty Religious
Policy and program Com-
mittee, and Woody Connettee.
president of the YM/YWCA, see
the requirement as a restric-
tion on Davidson. *‘The college
can't develop itself to its full
academic potential,’’ Connette
said.

Hall Award

The late appearance last
spring of ‘‘Inklings,”’ the an-
nual publication of the fresh-
man class, delayed the an-

nouncement of the winner of
the R. Windley Hall Writing
Award. Last week the depar-
tment of English announced
that the winner of the prize
was Steven L. Vitek. There
was no runner-up.

dissatisfaction with the funding
metiiod of NC-PIRG.

Sophomore David Cellon
stated that he got a refund
because ‘‘I needed the money.
But I resented them (NC-PIRG)
putting that on my bill.”

Another sophomore, Eppa
Rixey, voiced a similar answer.
“I needed the three dollars,
and I didn't think they should
put it in the comprehensive
fee.”’

Erwin’ Barron, another
organizer of the Davidson PIRG
chapter, feels that the present
funding process is the only

feasible alternative.

“We see ourselves as an
organization like the SGA and
the chorus, which get tuition
fees like we do,”’ he stated. ‘‘If
we had to raise money any
other way we would spend too
much time fund raising.”

Barron believes that students
will come to accept PIRG as
time goes on.

The Davidson PIRG now has
$2,243 to send to the state board.
The money will be allocated by
the board to various projects
throughout the state.
