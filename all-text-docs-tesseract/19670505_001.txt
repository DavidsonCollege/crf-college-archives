workers participated.

which was confined to a nar-
row sidewalk adjoining the
parking lot. Several Cone
headquarters employees had
been deputized and were also
serving as law enforcement
officers.

As Cone emerged from the

crowd approached a cres-
cendo. When one of the Da-
vidson students stepped off
the sidewalk onto the grass
bordering the parking lot,
one of the company deputies
grabbed him and arrested
him.

Former SNCC Organizer
Leads Carolina Activists

Eigh een-year-old Lynn Wells
is a quiet, cute, positive girl
with a pixie smile and long
black hair.

She is aso the North Carolina
coordinator of the Southern Stu-
‘dent Organizing Committee and
veteran and leader of many civ-
il rights demonstrations. She
once was part of a sit-in at the
White House that lasted seven
hours.

She dropped out of high school
at the end of the tenth grade
and worked in a white commun-
ity proverty program in Wash-
ington. D. C. She first became
involved in student action in the
march on Washington in 1963.

“In the ninth grade, I decided
because of my experience in

gangs. that there was a lot of

working with SSOC personnel on
a white students’ conference.
She became interested in SSOC

potential in these gangs that
could be developed. That's why
I got into the poverty program,”

Miss Wells said.

“In the gangs, they hate au-
thority and rich people.”

After the poverty program she
worked for the Student Non-Vio-
lent Coordinating Committee for
two years as a field secretary in
Washington. She ran a ‘freedom
school,"’ where she taught Negro
history and did tutoring.

“In 1965 I sat-in at the White
House with ten others," Miss
Wells explained. ‘‘During the
week of ‘Bloody Sunday’ in Sel-
ma, when all the marchers got
beat up. we were in the White
House seven hours protesting
police brutality.”

In February of this year she

and was offered a job with it.

“The reason I came to North
Carolina was that unions, when
first organized, are about the
most radical things around. The
problem is keeping them radi-
calized.”” she said.

Miss Wells can often be found
late at night in a union hall in
Greensboro doing the necessary
behind - the - scenes preparation
for a demonstration in support

sor of the program. ‘‘It provides
an opportunity for exploration
into the proposals."’

“It provides an opportunity,”
he continued. ‘‘for further dis-
cussion among the students and
faculty."

The faculty earlier this semes
ter adopted a plan which would
guarantee every student the
chance for association with a
fraternity either through actual
membership or through social
affiliation.

According to the plan. every
student going out for rush would

receive a Type A bid, which
would be just like bids of
fered by the fraternitles now, or
a Type B bid.

The Type B bid would involve
social affiliation for a period of
two months. one year or more
depending on the rapport be
tween the affiliate and the fra
terriity.

The development of this plan
grew out of a faculty request
issued last year that the frater
nities come up with a plan for
instituting some sort of 100 per
cent affiliation system.

The plan was drawn up and
proposed by a committee of the
Interfraternity Council which
included the fraternity presi
dents.

WALTER LINGLE

| One Change

The Board of Trustees voted unanimous
approval of the proposed faculty consti-
tution today, accepting with one minor
modification the entire document.

The new constitution goes into effect
immediately.

The alteration, contingent upon faculty
approval, would make the dean of the
faculty as well as the president an ex-
officio member of each of the faculty
committees.

Such an arrangement would insure bet-
ter communication between the faculty
and administration, according to Trustee
President Walter Lingle. “This way there
will be someone to represent the presi-
dent on the committees when he isn't
abie to attend.”

Faculty approval of the modification,
called “really not very significant” by
Dr. Alan B. Brinkley, chairman of the
Faculty Constitution Committee, is vir-
tually assured.

Brinkley said the faculty would proba-
bly consider the matter Tuesday at its
regular monthly meeting. “I expect it will
pass without any difficulties,” he said.

Most fraternity leaders are
maintaining a ‘‘wait and-see"
attitude about next week's cru-
cia] meeting of administration
officials and national fraterni-
ty representatives.

The meeting, to be held Fri-
day in Charlotte. was prompt-
ed by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s controversial total affilia
tion plan, which was to go
into effect next year.

The national offices of sev-
eralof Davidson's 12 frater

cher, also was arrested.

Peter Brandon. TWUA co-
ordinator, shouted above the
noise of the crowd for quiet
and order. However. he too
stepped off the sidewalk and
was quickly arrested. The
demonstrators were jeering
primarily at the police as Cone
drove off. The other David
son student was arrested as
he yelled at a policeman.

“It seems to me that a
Pperson’s position must be
pretty weak if he has to hire
thugs to arrest peopte,” Al-
len Pusey said.

- Leaders of the four fraterni
ties that have been assured
that no action will be taken
against them expressed satis-
faction with the situation.

Most of the others are wait-
ing to see the outcome of Fri-
day's meeting. which will be
closed to students.

Reaction to the plan itself
among fraternity members has
included numerous objections..
One out going president called
the plan “the beginning of the
death of Davidson fraterni-
ties.”

“The school is telling us who
we can have at the house. "‘he
said, ‘‘and this is destroying
the idea of the brotherhood.”

agreed. “‘We support the

commenting on the proposal
last year to do away with
fraternities at Davidson.

What will happen to the Da
vidson fraternity system if
most fraternities lose their na-
tional charters? The idea of
the loca] fraternity has been
viewed in both positive and
negative respects. since it ap
pears to be the only recourse.

The main disadvantages of
local fraternities being consid
ered at the present time is the
problem of putting on an ef.
fective rush program.

“It’s going to be difficult for
a local group to put on an ef
fective rush when ‘they are in
competition with’ a group
which has ‘a national. emblem
on their front porch.” com.
mented one student.

Another fraternity member

He praised Brinkley, as well
as well as three trustees: Lin
gle, Vice-President Warner Hall
.and Secretary William F. Mul. ‘
liss.

“This proposal was _ passed
back and forth a number of
times jin the last year,’ Martin
said. ‘It was a real exercise in
the kind of negotiation that ought
to be present in something like
this.”’

Brinkley hailed the trustee ac-
tion as ‘‘certainly a most grati-
fying conclusion to a long or-
deal."

The document approved by the
trustees is the second draft—
revised—prepared by the Con-
stitution Committee. The second
draft. first approved by the fac-

ulty last month. was revised

ulty members” desiring a

Trustees Authorize Plans
For Library Construction

Authorization to preceed with
inital planning for the construc-
tion of a new library was grant-
ed today at the meeting of the
Board of Trustees.

The members of the Building
and Grounds Committee were
commissioned to meet with
President D. Grier Martin to
decide on the site for the library
and conclude the initial plans for

het site.

The plans will then be present-
ed to the trustees at their fall
meeting in October.

Trustee President Walter Lin-
gle emphasized the trustees’ in-
tention to “build a new Nbrary
rather than to renovate the old.”

The plans will include a pro-
posed exterior design aad gen-
eral floor plan, but not the blue
prints.
