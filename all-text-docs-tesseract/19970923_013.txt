_ THE DAVIDSONIAN

A little sister’s admiration for

her football-playing brothers

O: Saturday, Davidson cel
J ebrated 100 years of Wildcat
football history, and I was there
watching the game. But I wasn’t

watching through the eyes of just
another freshman girl —I was there

watching from the eyes of a football
sister. Because just as kick-off took
place at Richardson Field here in
Davidson, Appalachian State Uni-
versity
and East-
erm Ken-
tucky did
the same
things
just up the road in Boone, and my
big brother will be on the field.

_ Foras long as I can remember
I have been watching football. It
started out with FPYC in Virginia:
muddy cleats at the doorway, Sat-
urdays at rainy fields, mom embar-
rassing everyone in the stands be-
cause she yells so loud and always
corrects the announcer when they
pronounce our last name, and my

it because he loves it, and I would
venture to say the same holds true at
Davidson. Secondly, these guys
work hard. In spite of the many
football jokes I have told over the
years, usually directed at Adam, it’s
important to realize how much these
athletes, and college level athletes
in general, devote to playing their
game. There are two-a-day prac-
tices in preseason, con-
ditioning in off-sea-
son, lifting in any sea-
son, plus time to watch
tapes, have meetings,
and, oh yeah, there are
academic things. Third, these guys
have guts. [have watched 18- year-
old boys be carried off the field
unconscious, watched my brother
undergo four surgeries and four
painful and frustrating recupera-
tions, and watched numerous play-
ers sacrifice their bodies in the name
of the game.. Finally, if the first
three don’t make it obvious, these
boys have passion. If you’ve ever

little sister spent time
and I sit- . with a
ting down The ONGOING Saga of an player, you
near the extended football family. Know the
cheerlead- fire in their
ers trying eyes be-

our hardest to stay amused. By the
time Adam, my brother, reached
junior varsity level, I'd started tak-
ing short novels to the games, and
my sister had discovered the hot
boiled peanuts at the refreshment
stand.

At the varsity level at

“Summerville High School (Foot-
ball Town, USA), we met marching
bands, bigger crowds, and the hype
of a long-founded school rivalry.
And in the midst of this, an incred-
ible thing occurred: I learned a little
football. I know most of the posi-
tions, the rules of the game, and
most of the calls, but what I know
best is my brother.

After five or six years of asking
Adam if he scored any touchdowns,
my mother finally explained that he
played defense and the implications
of such a position.

Since Adam signed with Ap- -

palachian St. four years ago, I’ve
learned a lot more: about football,
football players, and my brother.
First and foremost, these boys
love to play. Adam eats, sleeps, and
dreams of playing football. He does

fore the game, the adrenaline in
their bodies during the’ rush, the
thrill of victory, and agony of de-
feat.

I’ve seen groups of males cry-
ing together twice: the first was
Adam’s senior class when they were
knocked out of the playoffs one
game out of the championship, the
other was when ASU finished an
11-0 season to win the Southern
Conference in 1996.

So when I was at the game
Saturday, I looked for a couple of
things. First I looked for my new
big brother, Lorenzo Moll, because
isn’tit appropriate that my Davidson
brother be a football player too?

Next, I searched the faces in
the stands: the brothers and sisters
radiating the excitement of the day
and ready for the game to start, and
the parents beaming with pride and
remembering that day not so long
ago when their son finally made the
high school junior varsity team.

But most of all, I watched the

students and faculty of Davidson, °

ready to scoop up my own little
piece of Wildcat spirit.

[ it just me, or were the recent
elections pretty uninspiring?

As I stood staring blankly at
the ballot before me, I wondered
how, in good conscience, I could
vote for anyone.

The election campaigns were

apple *Indian for ‘Are you sane?’
*American for Independent Sena-
tor Jesse Tiko Smallwood. Vote
independent senator.”

Great, if his flyer is factually
correct, Inow know the Fijian word
for pineapple. I must admit the

devoid of second statement con-
anything fuses me.

ap - Stupent Opinion I wasn’t aware
proach- ‘ there was an “Indian”
ing an is- Travis J. Benn language. Are we talk-
sue. or nie ing Hindi? Tamil?
project. Apache? Cherokee?

Instead, they concentrated on catchy
— but often meaningless — politi-
cal slogans. On this campus, such
petty slogans have taken the place
of meaningful political discourse.

I would like to cite two ex-
amples that appeared on my hall
priortothe election. I didnot choose
these examples to single anyone out
for attack; but rather to illustrate a
point.

One flyer read” “Rugged Cra-
ziness. Ready for whatever. Take
a walk on the wild side...Crazy Joe.”
Not only am I not sure what this
flyer means, it gives me no good
reason why I should vote for him.

Perhaps, if the flyer had read:
“Take a walk on the radical side,” I
might have had some vaguely po-
litical notion of what to expect from
“Crazy Joe.”

I also encountered a flyer for
Jesse Smallwood on my hall. It
read: “Tiko:??? *Fijian for pine-

What?

Perhaps the third point is a
subtle appeal to those red-blooded
Americans among us. Regardless,
his poster fails to state an issue or an
honest reason to vote for him.

Irealize political speeches were
held in front of Chambers, and I
applaud the effort behind them.
However, I did not encounter a
single advertisement for the event.

None of the campaign flyers scat- -

tered around campus provided a
hint of a speech.

No one ended their flyer say-
ing, “Come hear me speak on the
issues Sunday in front of Cham-
bers.”

Nor did any of the candidates
make use of the Davidsonian or
Libertas to provide us with a vision
of their role in the SGA. On this
campus, plenty of forums exist for
the exhange of ideas.

SGA: A How Not To guide in politics

sit in the Union pit and offer to
answer questions passers-by might
have. Creative and informative
campaign approaches that reach a
large audience were completely ig-
nored. Politics shouldinvolve more
than simply posting a few flyers .
and telling your friends to vote for
you.

A friend of mine suggested this
phenomenon had to do with a lack
of substantial issues. I disagree.
Every individual has issues and
concerns — ranging from the envi-
ronment to community service —
that could form the basis of a cam-
paign.

The SGA has 4,000 dollars al-
located for “special projects.” Why
doesn’t a candidate — or the SGA
itself, for that matter — articulate a
plan for this money other than build-
ing a needless playground?

A candidate could make recy-
cling the focus of an SGA effort to
increase awareness and participa-
tion in the recycling program. __

The money could be used to-
ward a campus-wide community
service event or charity event.

Increasingly, the SGA has be-
come a reactive — rather than pro-
active — body. The only time
people take an interestin the SGA is
when they are reacting to an issue
such as the Intervarsity debate.

Where is the candidate who
will take a proactive stance and
campaign witha vision forthe SGA?

A love affair with Davidson

y love affair with Davidson
College began in September
1935. It was on this date that I
entered, as a very green 16-year-old
country boy, the great class of 1939.
Back in 1935, most of us were
poor. We had to struggle with odd
jobs. to:
pay our
annual

John Mack Walker Sr., also a min-
ister, graduated from Davidson in
1907 as senior class president. My
brother, Dr. John Mack Walker, Jr.,
and also a minister, graduated in
1936 as class salutatorian. He was
best remembered for his wood sculp-

tures. You see

expenses,
which
were un-
der 500 dollars.

Our excellent president, Dr.
Walter Lingle, had assembled a
great faculty. My favorites were
Bill McGavock (Mathematics),
Frontis Johnson (History), and Sam
Knight (Chemistry). Davidson
never went into debt, for its capable
treasurer, Frank Jackson, worked
only on a cash basis (hence his
nickname “Cash’”). Davidson was
then, as now, a great college!

Davidson had been talked about
in my home as long as Ican remem-
ber. My grandfather, Dr. Thomas
English, graduated in 1872 as vale-
dictorian, and all his nine grand-
sons — five ministers, three physi-
cians, and one lawyer — graduated
from Davidson.

I was named for this wonderful
seminary professor. My father, Dr.

Our family has
had many
memories through many years!

My own first memory of
Davidson was of the annual fresh-
man cake race, when 93 out of our.
200 members of the class of 1939
ran this 1.8-mile course, still very
popular today. Dave Woodward,
my classmate who later became an
educational missionary to Tibet, and
I tied for first place with a new
record of 9:34.8, obliterating the
old record, set by Earle Frazier in
1932, by all of 0.7 seconds!

This was my first footrace ever!
I chose for my prize a handsome
Davidson belt buckle — the other
40 prizes were cakes — which
helped me to cement my relation-
ship with Davidson. The buckle
was always with me for four years
of college and three years of gradu-

até school until the Army Air Corps
in 1942 had other ideas for proper
GI uniform attire.

My best personal memories of
Davidson are of Pete Whittle, who
was for many years Davidson’s
outstanding track and cross country
coach and, according to many, the
greatest booster the College has ever
had.

He was a dear friend and for
four years led me through a won-
derful track and cross country ca-
reer. He deservedly was chosen in
the first class of Davidson’s Hall of
Famers.

This love affair which started
62 years ago will continue until the
day I die.
