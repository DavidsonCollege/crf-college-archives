We regret that last week we were so
crowded for space that the item ‘about
our more patriotic members—R. W.
Robinson and M. W. Gibson, of the
Junior class—going into’ military service,
was omitted. Robinson volunteered with
the Marines, and is stationed on Paris
Island, off the coast of South Carolina.
Gibson is in Dr. Brenizer’s Hospital
Unit.

These felows are missed. We wish

We are proud that we responded so
nobly to the cause of our brother in
khaki. This subscription is not alto-
gether out of well-filled garners. You
actually hear students say what they arc
going to sacrifice. One fellow who loves
apples says that hé is going to stop get-
ting a jit’s worth every night after sup-
per. Others are denying themselves ar-
ticles of not-needed clothing. And vari-
ous other instances could be given where
men are sacrificing to meet this subscrip-
tion. A fine spirit of loyalty and patriot-
ism prevails here, or this amount would
never have been realized.

And they did come! Those long-look-

The Magazine is missing as we go to

“There is no greater glory for a man
while yet he lives than that which he
achieves by hand and fvot,” said Alcin-
