Honors College Members Evaluate Program
Some Express Desire For Changes

By JOE SMITH
Associate Editor

A random sampling of the -

students presently enrolled
in the Honors College indi-
cates that they are, for the

most part, | satisfied with
that program.
It also reveals, however,

a desire for further change
in the program among a
number of the students.

Tom Opie, a senior whose
areas of concentration are
organic chemistry and _ en-
vironmental problems, said
that his experience in the
Honors ‘College had done
more to give direction to
his studies than anything
else in his career at David-
son.

Gene Early, whose prin-
cipal interest is in educa-
tional psychology, said that
the program is rewarding
in that it removes the frag-
mentation of time and _ in-
terest created by the course
set-up of the regular col-
lege. : -

' Early ~pointed out that
these fragmentations under-
mined the educational value
of regular courses.

‘All “of the Honors’ College
students agreed that the re-
moval of graduation require-

ments enabled them to pur-
sue interests which would
have been inaccessable un-
der the regular system.
Greg Scott, who is speci-
alizing in labor relations
and local government, said
that this ‘arrangement was
very rewarding from the
point of view of a senior.
He noted that, at this
point in his career, he was
ready for. practical experi-
ence and independent work,
rather than further classes.
The students’ enthusiasm

is tempered by a concern
that the Honors ~ College
move further away from the

traditional educational for-
mat.
John McLean, a_ junior.

who will leave the Honors
College at the end of this
term, stated that the pro-
gram_ involved an_evalua-
tion process which is more
rigorous than that of the re-
gular college.

He said that freedom
from traditional evaluation
had been a thevikos reason

for his application to the
program in the first place.

The position was also
taken by a number of the
students that the Honors
College was not fostering
‘the kind of work that the
regular curriculum blocks.

(Danny Olodfelter, a junior
specializing in philosophy,
pointed out that the selec-
tion process almost preclud-

~ ed the ‘development of out-

standing skills, since the
people chosen to participate
had already, in one way of

another, shown that” the
skills in question were al-
ready developed.

Students Rich Cowart and
Steve Salyer maintained
that the Honors College was
not fulfiting its promise to
the full in that much of the
work being dofe at present
could be done under the re-
gular curriculum.

Salyer pointed out that the
independent study tracts_ of
the regular curriculum give
all students the opportunity
to do the same kind of work
that Honors College.students
do.

$n eee Hears Report
For Freshman Assignment

By RICHARD WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor
‘Preliminary recommenda-
tions for Davidson's new so-
cial system have been sub
mitted to the Committee of
Eighteen by the financial
and the procedure subcom-

mittees.

Although the committee
expressed a general agree-
ment with these proposals,

they are not necéssarily the
final proposals of the com-
mittee.

The procedure subcommit-
tee recommended:

“That beginning the se-
cond term (or possibly over
the Christmas holidays)
each freshman be assigned
to one of the 12 houses, to
take benefit of the social
life of the house and eat a

Clodfelter On Nader Show

By ALEC HOON
Staff Writer

Junior Danny Clodfelter
spent last summer working
for Ralph Nader's famous
or infamous (depending on
your viewpoint) Raiders on
a controversial documentary
of the North Carolina tex-
tile industry. ;

The documentary, the

first. of, eight such studies
researched by Nader-affili-
ated groups to be shown’ on
television,, was seen Wed-

-nesday—night—at— 9-36.

It focused on the town of
Kannapolis, North Carolina,
and on the Cannon Mills, a
textile company which for
all intents and purposes
owns the town: the homes,

the stores, and the property.

The main emphasis of the
show was in determining
the relationship between
those people connected with

...Kannopolis and Mr. Charles

Cannon, owner of the mills
and hence the town.

There were discrepancies
on what individuals thought
of Mr. Cannon personally,
but the overall import of
their dialogues seemed to
be that these people lives
were being dictated to them
by Mr. Cannon.

Working with Clodfelter
on this project were. John
Foster, Davidson, class of ’70,
Miss Lilona Smith, a Chapel
Hill law school student, Miss
Kate Blackwell, a free-lance
writer, and Harrison Wil-
ford, a 1962 Davidson gradu-
ate ‘and the group's leader.

Using Nader's idea that
“corporations have a _ cer-
tain - responsibility to’ the
public’ the group set out to
find specifically how the

‘Cannon Mills company and

the J. P. Stevens Corpora-
tion mill at. Roanoke Ra-
pids used their timmense
powers as the sole large-
scale employers of their re-
spective towns.

In discussing the compan-
ies’ failings, Clodfelter point-

| ed to ‘‘their failure to re-

cognize that. the problems of

noise in the machinery and

of the occurance of byssi-

“That at the beginning of
the spring term each. fresh-
man be reassigned to a dif-
ferent house by means of
random selection, and that
he be allowed to take part
in the social life offered and
eat two meals a: week at his
new house,

‘That at the end of this

- year, each freshman who
desires. to do so, _ lists» his
four top preferences of

houses with which he wishes
to associate. at the begin-
ning of his sophomore year.

“Memberships to the
houses will then be made
with regard to space avall-
abe; each house having ap-
proximately equal member-
ship.

“He may remain at this
house as long as he chooses
to do so or may move at the
end of any term on the basis
of space available by re-
submitting, himself. to the
self-selecting process."

The procedure subcommit-
tee also recommended that
the board for all upper class-
men be on the basis of in-
dividual arrangement with
the social organization. The
subcommittee said the soci-
al system would not be com-
pulsory after the freshman
year.

The subcommittee also
proposed that ‘‘any house
expressing its desire to re-
main in operation under
these new guidelines will be
guaranteed a house through
the academic year 1971-72. .

“In 1971-72 every upper
classman . self-selected into

any group- should have
equal access to all privi-
leges in the house, includ-

ing membership in the na-
tional _organization, | if one
should exist.’’

The subcommittee on fin-
ances split their report into
two parts, depending™ on
' whether feaveronsies accept

or reject the trustee action.
If they accept the action
the “houses should continue
to manage their social acti-
vities and food services ac-
cording to the stipulations
herein defined. Further-
more, ‘the house would con-
tinue election of its .. . fin-
ancial agents.

“The college will -require
that monthly financial re-
ports be submitted to the
business office in an attempt -
to stay clear of financial dif-
ficulties.

“Should there be a com-
pulsory system of freshman
assignment, houses should
be reimbursed for meal and

“After debts have been
paid, the fraternity may dis-

wishes. Because of the time
element, we have no assur-
ance that replacement fur-
niture could be. obtained
prior to September 1971."

If the fraternities choose
to reject the trustee action,
