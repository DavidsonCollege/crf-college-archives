Davidson — an ‘unlikely
‘bluegrass mecca,’ as the Char-
lotte Observer termed it, and so it
was last Saturday when the na-
- tion’s top progressive bluegrass
band, the Seldom Scene, per-
formed for the Sequicentennial
Alumni Weekend celebration.
The cold weather which forced the
performance to take place in Love
Auditorium rather than outside,
served as a sharp contrast to the
warm sounds of bluegrass. John
Starling, Davidson class of ’62,
led the group during their reunion
tour which sold out the Kennedy
Center in Washington, D.C. last
November.

- Mix-ups at the airport caused
the band to start slightly later than
scheduled. It didn’t take long,
however, for the Seldom Scene to
get into full swing, and their focus
turned to railroads rather than air-
ports. As Starling put, “I’ve al-
ways had an affinity for train
songs. Trains are about being

The band played a variety of

Opening for the Seldom Scene
was senior Bobby Houck, as well

as a student bluegrass band com-
posed of Molly Cochran, Valerie
Graves, Darek Newby, and Jay
Wilkins.

Bobby Houck first became in-
terested in music as a senior in
high school. Since then, he has
been very active performing for

campus events, especially for Fri-
day Afternoon Clubs with a band
whose members include Frank
Whitaker, Andy Ball, Greg Keith,
and George Guise. This summer,
Bobby will pursue his musical
career by playing in bars and clubs
along the South Carolina coast.
His style of music varies from
folk, to bluegrass, to rock.

“It was a dream come true,”
said Bobby about the opportunity
to open for the Seldom Scene. “I’d
heard them play before a few
years ago in Washington, and |
have a lot of their albums.”

For Molly COchran, opening
for her favorite bluegrass band
was “one of-the highlights of her
Davidson experience.” A banjo
player herself, Molly especially
enjoyed hearing her role model,
Ben Elderidge, perform. Molly
has been playing the banjo for
seven years now.

English majors give answers for a careers

[Editor’s note. This is the second
part of an article run in the April
15 issue of the Davidsonian. The
article dealt with Davidson
graduates who had majored in En-
glish. They responded to the
Davidsonian with their thoughts
on the career hurdles for English
majors.

Two graduates emphasized
persistence in job seeking; the
Vanderbilt law student wrote of
his first position as an Atlanta
Constitution news reporter, “‘Get-
ting the job required considerable
. patience: I bugged the guy about
an internship beginning when I
was a sophomore and landed the
job two years later!”

The second year law student
‘ who previously worked as a Bos-
ton paralegal wrote, “I got an in-

rioeala issues or push the audience
with satire, the actors provided us”
with an enjoyable evening of fun.
This Neil Simon script leaves
nothing to the imagination, tying
up the plot with a sweet ending,
pulling heart strings with refer-
ence to Hitler’s Germany and the
plight of the Jews. Simon refuses
to end on a note less than light-
hearted. He doesn’t challenge the
audience to reach beyond the

references to the political situation
in the 1930s. We are left with a
cotton candy-like feeling, pretty
to look at, nice on the tongue, but

The set artfully created a
crowded atmosphere. Cutting off
bed lengths so that they were visu-
ally uncomfortable, and placing
the rooms too close for comfort,
the construction crew translated

that aspect of Simon’s script to a

tee. The backdrop, however, did
not seem to flow convincingly
into~the foreground. It almost
seemed as though it didn’t belong.
My congratulations to the en-
semble for creating a fun evening
for the audience. The script was
not brilliant, but they shined. The
themes were not monumental, but
the audience was entertained. The

According to the Atlanta
lawyer, “The vast amount of read-
ing and writing has helped me in
my present job. Also, English was
an area of great interest to me and
one not especially accessible after
college.”

For students considering an
English major, the Boston
paralegal writes, “I know it’s un-
nerving to graduate with a degree
in English and no idea what to do.
I, for one, was terrified and
wished that I had taken a computer
course after all. But you will find
that you learn very quickly on the
job, and after a little while you
will even gain some self-confi-
dence in your abilities. I would
say don’t be afraid to take some
chances; it’s a good time to do it.
And when yow test yourself,

you'll see that you can do it after
all.”
