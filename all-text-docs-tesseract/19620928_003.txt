THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1962

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

A Wise Indecision?

Davidson’s chronic indecisive-
ness, pointed to in another connection
last week, has placed more of its con-
stituents—students this time-——in an-
other unfortunate position. The cut
policy, which has changed greatly
since last year, is now in a state of
incompletion, leaving some question
as to whether the change has been
beneficial or if it will be totally un-
desirable.

Davidson has in the past discrim-
inated against students who live more
than a few hours drive from campus,
by placing heavy restrictions on class
absences on the days immediately
preceding and following holidays. We
believe that this in itself was unfair.
Nevertheless, even under the old sys-
tem a student so unfortunate as to
live out of state could forfeit cuts
during the semester in order to be
able to spend a holiday at home.

The newest regulations, however,
though appearing to be more liberal,
have actually limited students more
severely in the place where they have
desired more freedom. They have
prescribed the eliminetion of cuts be-

A New Role

So far so good freshmen! But....

This seemed to be the gist of the
timely warnings sandwiched between
the other announcements in Monday's
assembly. An ounce of prevention and
all that sort of thing.

But we couldn't help remember-
ing that we were there in the year of
the last Great Riot. We never have
quite gotten used to the idea that this
year there will be no more bright-
eyed bucket wielders. For if nothing
else it showed that a new class had
some spirit and, more important, some
concern. And so far the present class
has shown us none.

No cocky questioners of the
status quo have appeared this year.
Are they really out to rack up some
grades? Or can it be they are already
absorbed into the establishment? We
seriously doubt the former.

But this lack of concern is not
isolated to the freshman class. What
else but this would cause a campus to
become a “suitcase college?’ Without
a doubt the only extracurricular acti-
vities indulged in by some gentlemen
are strictly limited to Hattie’s and the
parked car.

Rather than spend a whole editor-
ial railing against non-participants
though, we would submit that the
whole student body needs to see the
role of a student in new terms. If the
terms are made important enough the
result will surely be increased parti-
cipation and interest. .

The problem of having a narrow
view of his role in society is of course
not limited to the student on this
campus. National surveys have shown
that most students do not want to be-
lieve that their activities might make
a difference. Some 80% of those poll-
ed admitted that they never get as

Peon Manifesto

Where is the Peon Army? Two
long, dreary years have passed since
this noble non-exclusive group of
Davidson volunteers interested in mili-
tary affairs above and beyond the call
of the ROTC last performed its time-
honored activities on the drill field.

Half of the present student body
has never seen this traditional renown-
ed group, and there is even a new
generation of ROTC cadre which has
not yet received its baptism of fire.

fore and after holidays. And yet they
give no alternative. They do not indi-
cate what punishment, if any, shall be
used. Moreover, it is our understand-
ing that certain faculty members de-
sire to withhold judgement until after
the first holiday season. Is it fair to
make a law punitive rather than pre-
ventive?

If the indecisiveness is dissolved
in this case, will the punishment be so
severe as to forbid many students the
only cuts they have ever previously
needed during a semester? Or will an
out-of-the-area student be able to have
the same amount of time at home on
holidays with the same great sacrifice

during the semester? Whatever the.

verdict, the student should have the
opportunity to choose. We urge a de-
cision.

One of the reasons given for the
restrictions under either cut system
has been that certain “other colleges
have similar class absence regula-
tions.” If Davidson cannot choose to
be independent in setting regulations
peculiar to its own campus situation,
then perhaps we should look at the
W&L cut system. . . (the real one.)

BJ

worked up over something that hap-
pens in political or public affairs as
something that happens in their per-
sonal life. Over 75% of students are
placidly contented with their present
day-to-day activities.

The blame doesn’t lie only with
the students either. Neither society
nor colleges and universities have rec:
ognized that the student should be
allowed to do more than study, parti-
cipate in sports, and raise cain. Col-
leges, and this is certainly evident
here, lay too much emphasis on ad-
justing and little or nothing is said
about acting.

_On how many campuses is the
political study or action group viewed
with suspicion or even labeled sub-
versive because it seems to be stepping
out of the “traditional” role of the
student? This is something we need
to think about.

We view as a healthy sign the
controversial schedule of speakers the
Student Council has lined up. The
challenging of ideas is the first step
along’ the road to a new role for stud-
ents.

The next step is to put the ideas
to work on a community level. Such
organizations as the Conservative Club
and the National Student Association,
working through the Student Council,
should be used to focus student activi-
ty in this direction.

At present we are in the midst
of four years of freedom that we will
never again have in our lives. At no
other time wil! our obligations be so
ew.

We do have one _ obligation
though. To question and act in society
is an obligation we have to ourselves
and the community. There is certainly
room for growth on both sides.

Have the cold blasts of coolness
frozen the hot peon blood? Has the
clarion’s call been drowned out by the
tramping of marching feet? Is the
army destined to die and fade away?

Never! Each Tuesday afternoon
the world stands silent and breathless
awaiting the mighty tide which once
again must sweep across the drill
field! Peons unite! The strife you cause
may be your own!

YMCA Philcsophy

BY NEIL NICHOLS
YMCA President

(Auther’s Note: These are
my own thoughts and convic-
tions about the YMCA. How-
ever, they do, | believe, coin-
cide with the opinions of the’
“¥" cabinet.)

Davidson is an_ institution
made up of students from 18 to
24 years of age, an age when a
person is more confused, dis-
illusioned, and even disgusted
than he will be at any other
time in his life. He is confused
about religious norms, disillu-
sioned about theological opinion
of a world which is growing too
fast for man's finite mind to
comprehend, much less keep up
with.

The Davidson student is of a
high enough caliber intellectual-
ly to question. thoroughly. Yet
his indeterminate surroundings
ereate a destre for security
which makes him refuse to ac-
cept that which isn’t concrete,
that which isn't a sure thing.

Davidson is, in businessman
Gene Bingham’s words, a
“suitcase” college where it
is often thought not coo! or
just plain undesirable to par-
ticipate actively in any cam-
pus organization from football
to fraternity.

These circumstances make the
position and program of the
YMCA difficult to explain and
difficult to carry out.

Yet the very fact that we are

Thompson

Dear Editor:

Last year THE DAVIDSON-
IAN ran a series of editorials
and articles suggesting changes
in the Richardson Scholarship
program for International Stud-
ents.

Intended by the author to
bring about what he considered
reform, the articles had so little
relation to the facts that they
served only to demoralize last
year’s group of international
students and to jeopardize the
continuation of the program by
the Trustees of the Richardson
Foundation. I am requesting the
publication of this letter in
hopes of forestalling a repeti-
tion of last year's experience.

The gist of the proposed
change was that the Interna-
tional Students should not be
required to carry a normal
academic load and that they
should not be bound by the
regulations regarding class
and chapel attendance, and so
forth. The purpose was to free
them from much of their ob-
ligation of studying and to en-
able them to absent them-
selves from the campus more
frequently and for more ex-
tensive trips to various parts
of the country.

The proposed changes were

confused @ad disgusted about
religious norms and theological
opinions shows that we are in-
terested in them. The fact that
we question implies that we hon-
estly want an answer. And even
though we are a suitcase college,
we are a college of students with
ability and potential; a college
of leaders.

it Is because of this thet |
consider the position of the
YMCA secure and very valua-
ble to the Davidson student.

The “Y" is trying to help
solve the confusion about re-
ligious norms and theological
ideas by presenting forums, pro-
grams, and worship services
which seek to provide a sound
basis for ideas toward religion.
1 sincerely believe that the “Y"
has the answer for the question-
ing and searching after security,
i.e., the search for what is good
in life, and that answer is to be
found in Service. And I am not
quite willing to admit that the
student of ability at the suitcase
college is as materialistic as he
or his professor believes him to
be.

If he is so materialistic, than
why will he stay up long into the
night arguing over the nature
of a fraternity pledge program,
or why will he concern himself

about the honor system, or the.

faculty regulations? Certainly
this implies that he is interested
in ideas and their cffect.

The ideal that the “Y”
would put before the student

is the ideal of service. The
sole purpose of the YMCA is
to serve one’s fellow man in
the spirit of love, love for the
fellow men and love for God,
as was taught by Christ.

But what does bother me is
the apathy and laziness of alt
of us, the Davidson students.
As broad and strong as the “Y"
program is, this apathy can
stifle it. If the “Y" fails to
serve, if the “Y" fails to serve
in the spirit of love, then the
position of the “Y" will cease
to be secure and valuable to the
Davidson student. It will fail
through lack of activity and lack
of support, not through lack of
purpose.

It is through the area chair-
men that the “Y" operates;
through them that it serves. I
would ask that you not to be
content with checking a few
blanks on an interest card, but
seek these area chairmen out
personally. Their job is a big
one and it would help them out
a great deal if you would let
them know your willingness to
help.

We will need your help more
and more, for the “Y" is ex-
panding ever further. It is go-
ing to need more than the 50%
of the students which participat-
.ed in some phase of the ‘“Y”
program last year.

It is only through student sup-
port that the “Y"” can serve. If
it fails to serve and to serve ef-
fectively, than you and 1 have
failed.

Russell Kirk is a social conservative more than an
economic one. He has spent his life analyzing our pat-
terns of social organization and attempting to discover

These, he says, have

society and others for some time, and will continue
to do so, so long as we consider strict adherence to

academicians call for constant review of our basic

ethical assumptions.

Kirk made strikingly

clear last week the conse-

quences of allowing orthodoxy to decay or to be disrupted.
In the Congo, when the Independence movement broke
down the order and structure of the Belgian-missionary

system, traditional norms

quickly disintegrated. The

that Kirk “failed to mention which century” it came from.

of the doctrines of Edmund

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Thompson Decries Proposed Changes |
In Richardson Scholarship Program

unacceptable for two reasons.
First, the Trustees of the Rich-
ardson Foundation are perfect-
ly clear in their intention that
academic work is to be the prim-
ary concern of the scholarship
men during the academic year.
At the end of the year oppor-
tunity to visit various parts of
the country is provided by -
travel grant to be used in the
summer.

in view of the fact that the
Richardson program was de-
vised by Dr. Martin and Mr.
H. S$. Richardson personally,
there is no doubt (in spite of
last year’s DAVIDSONIAN)
that the President understands
Mr. Richardson’‘s intentions.

Secondly, law requires the
International Students to take a
full academic program. Those
Acts of Congress which created
the non-immigrant student visas,
in contrast to tourist visas and

PEANUTS

visas for immigrants, define the
student as one who takes a nor-
mal academic program at an
institution accredited for the
purpose by the State Depart-
ment.

Consequently, the so-called
reforms, are a violation of law
which should result in David-
son’s losing its accreditation and
the right to issue the forms by
which our foreign students ob-
tain student visas.

Dear Editor:

During the summer Davidson
seems to have taken on a new
face.. Students can now walk on
asphalt where before there was
rough concrete or dirt. A new
air-conditioned bookstore makes
buying books almost a pleasure.

The new room in the dome will
soon be completed. Even the
ginkgo treec-has been removed.
Our face grows more respectable
each year.

At what cost, though, do we
make these improvements?
During the summer one of our
outstanding professors, Dr.
Robert Lord, left Davidson. As
of yet the administration has
made no statement about his
departure.

We are well aware of his
criticisms of schoo! policy and
the cold reception he received
from the administration. He left
Davidson, however, not because
of his disagreement with school
policies, but because he was of-
fered a sizable increase in salary
at another school.

Now it is understandable that
Davidson cannot compete on a
pay scale with larger schools;
but how can we afford to be

EVEN GARGOVLES GET HUNERY! | GARGOYLES GET HUNGRY !

building asphalt walks and re-. -
modeling rooms when our out-
standing faculty members are
leaving because of their. salar-
jes?

It is time the administration
awoke to the fact that Devid-
son’s hallowed halls are not
as attractive to outsiders as
they are to alumni. Like Or.
Lord, many of our young pro-
fessors are “outsiders.” Un-
less Davidson can compete on
@ salary-basis with other
schools, we may soon find a
number of these professors
following Dr. Lord’s example.

A beautiful campus is not es-
sential to a college education,
but good professors are. It is
very discouraging for us as
students to see Davidson's “face”
being beautified at the expense
of the more vital parts of our
education.
