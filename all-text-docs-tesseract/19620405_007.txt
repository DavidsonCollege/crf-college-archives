As well as I can find out, the honor of editing the
first sports column goes to M. R. Doubles, whose column,
ON GRIDIRON appeared first in the October 18,
1920, issue of this newspaper. An interesting note on that
column is that Mr. Doubles’s first words were, “Well
fellows — we got licked again last week.”

Sports columns have appeared over quite a variety
of heads over the years. My nomination of some of the
more unusual and ori; 1 are B. B. SHOTS BY B. B.

THE ATHLETIC TRAIL.

GRIDIRON CLASH WITH WAKE A
THING OF THE PAST

Time changes many things in the sports scene over
the years. It has been over 25 years since Wake Forest
and Davidson, formerly intense rivals, have met on the
gridiron. Now a new rivalry, just as intense, seems to
be building up for the future with Davidson’s new style)
basketball.

Another sight gone from the campus with the an-|
nual Wake game is old Enoch Donaldson and his pet
lizard. Enoch would come out with his lizard to predict
the result of eacli ’Cat-Demon Deacon contest.

In 1914, when the first newspaper came out, there
were only five sports on campus: football, baseball,
basketball, tennis and track. Since then the college
athletic program has greatly expanded to include golf,
wrestling, swimming, soccer, and riflry.

The December 9, 1931, issue contained the announce-
ment that 33 freshmen were trying out for a position on
the freshman wrestling team. I’m sure that Coach Charlie
Parker wishes he had such luck.

WILDCAT COMES FORTY YEARS TOO LATE

Way back in 1923, a plea went out from a sports|
editor as follows:

Now that the U. of Florida has an alligator for a
mascot and Princeton has a tiger, why can’t we get a
wildcat.

It seems that Joe Martin has fulfilled a dream.

Tony Casali — the feelings of many sports
editors in the appea ———_— in his column of Novem-
ber 16, 1938. “P.S. at someone—anybody—to
write this column next week.”

SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE

Also appearing in the same column was this line.
“Interfraternity football is drawing to a close with several
teams fighting it out for first place honors. The Kappa
Sigs lead the pack with no defeats.” Sounds familiar?

Although some things c with time, many things
appear remarkably the same. very first issue of THE
DAVIDSONIAN carried this request:

More o should be done, and the
best practice for it will be during this week’s game on the
hill. With every man solidly behind the team, in spirit
and in truth, it promises to be well started on a glorious
season.

As a parting thought, it might be of interest to some

that the lead line of the first sports story in the first
issue of the newspaper ran like this: “hak-a-rak-a-boom-a-

begun in 1923.

Monk Younger returned to
Davidson, where eight years be-
fore as a frosh gridder he had
maneuvered his way into nearly
every All-State selection made.
He came back now with Tex Til-
son to coach a shoddy football
team.

BIRTH PANGS

The renaissance had its birth
pangs. Richardson Stadium was
christened in his first year, but
his team could muster only a
lacklustre 3-7 record, hardly the
portents of a renaissance.

Then things began to happen.
Tilson, working with the cin-
dermen, began to put a track
team together. And Monk
Younger took the helm of the
basketballers.

And on the gridiron the pig-
skin took a bounce for the bet-
ter, the “Red and Black Ma-
chine” rolling to a 62 record.
It was beginning of a rise to
the apex of football fame in the
state.

Younger’s squad continued
the climb the next year. The
1925 squad missed the state
title by a tissuethin breadth,
losing to N.C. State in a game
in which the ‘Cats did every-
thing but score. By every
measure except the scoreboard
they won the game.

that year voth Duke (26-0) and
Carolina. Despite an average
surplus of twenty pounds be-
neath the belts of their foes
(Quips and Cranks figure), the
'25 team recorded another re-
spectable 6-2 season.

And then the millenium. It
was 1926, and the ‘Cats were
scheduled to meet every major
team in the state. Coupling a
merciless defense with a charg
ing offense the red and black
machine was mechanized with
gridiron muscle like nothing
before or ever since.

Only one state team could
score on the ‘Cats, and that was
Wake Forest, via a field goal.
On December 2, 1926, the spec-
tacular season was culminated
as the ‘Cats downed Duke and
earned the state championship
title. It is interesting to note
that the ‘Cats downed U.N.C.
that year 100 and edged State
3-0.

THE SUMMIT

This was the summit. From
then until the departure of
Monk Younger, football prowess
was still respectable, but never
quite so spectacular.

THE DAVIDSONIAN printed
nebulous words of praise upon
Monk Younger's departure in
1931 to assume head coaching
duties. at his alma mater, VPI.

His nine years were hard to
sum up. Perhaps Quips and
Cranks was closer to it. He had
fathered a renaissance, and
authored a score of athletic
legends.

BY BILL GODWIN
Sports Editor, 1960

Pete Whittle sat beneath
a double row of framed cer-
tificates and stared the
length of the football field
from his endzone office per-
spective.

“We had Richardson Field
when I came here,” he said,
“but we had only a half of one
stadium.”

Coach Whittle, the senior
member of Davidson's sports
staff in terms of service, was
thinking back to 1926, when he
became a student here, and to
1930, when he joined the ath-
letic department.

“That year | was a fresh-
man,” he seid, “the chairman
of the Court of Control made
us come down here and build
a bow! eof bleachers around
the field. We'd draw 12,000
people to « football geme.
There was tremendous inter-
est in sports.”

Davidson won the state foot-
ball championship in 1926, de-
feating Duke and Carolina, los-
ing to Hampden-Sydney.

“The players seemed to be
more rugged and meaner than
they are now,” Whittle said.
“We had a lot of boys on the
team who grew up in Davidson,
a lot of professors’ sons.”

Of course, there was no play-
er subsidization then and the
Wildcats were in the “Big’ 5,”
along with Carolina, Duke,
Wake Forest and N. C. State.

Whittle reflected on the
various roads these colleges
have taken since then and
said he’s glad Davidson “has
never gotten excited about
going big time” in athletics
as other schools have.

The venerable Davidson track
coach, a veteran of almost 150
victories in his sport, was asked
to reminisce for this 50th anni-
versary issue of THE DAVID-
SONIAN.

“We had a terrible gym in
those days,”’ he said. It stood
where the Student Union now is.
“It had an under-regulation-size
basketball court and they hung
mats on the walls to protect the
players. We couldn't accommo-
date the student body. They just
couldn't all get in and some of
the ones who did practically
had to miss supper to see a
game.”

Whittle has been a force be-
hind Davidson's physical educa-
tion program, which didn’t exist
to any degree before 1928. Cap-
tain Pritchard, the athletic di-
rector that year, started a modi-
fied program.

“Students were required to
take three hours of exercise «
week on their own,” Whittle
said. “We hed te sign cards

Athletes

BY JIMMY LEWIS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A few hours. thumbing
through old copies of THE DAV-
IDSONIAN, together with sev-
eral chats with some of the real
old timers on campus reveals a
very startling fact. Davidson
College in the past half century
has turned out some athletes
that would rank with the finest
performers of any large south-
ern university.

The first man mentioned
when all-time great Davidson
athletes are discussed is Tommy
Peters. Peters was at Davidson
only two years before he met
death in World War II, but still
he ranks with the best Davidson
athletes in four different sports.
He was an All-Southern end on
the football team. Against Wash-
ington and Lee he teamed with
his twin brother George, a quar-
terback, for all three touch-
downs in a 21-13 victory. He was
the leading hitter and a ball-
hawking centerfielder on the
baseball team. Between innings

animous All-Conference selec-
tion in 1943. In 1954 he was
named to the all-time All-State
team. All this he did in one year
of va#sity sports.

Second only to Tommy
Peters in the rating of out-
standing cagers is Buddy
Cheek. During the late 1940's
according to THE DAVIDSON.

he found time to win the shot

main sport. He averaged 20.3
points per game on a team that

line, he ranked high in the na-
tion in free throw percentage.
In addition, Cheek was an All-
State end on the football team.

Perhaps the man with the
most outstanding undergrad-
vate record ever at Davidson
was Martin “Teeny” Lafferty.
In addition to making the
“Little All-America” football
team in 1937, he was presi-
dent of the Student Body,
ROTC Corps Commander, Phi
Beta Kappa, ODK, and Who's
Who.

Wallace Wade, the great
sage of football, rated the “Con-
cord Comet" on an even par
with “Ace” Parker of Duke.
Bobby Dodd, commenting on
Lafferty's performance against
Duke in 1937, stated “His was
the greatest single exhibition of
all around football I’ve ever
seen.”

Another Davidson backfield
star rated on a par with Laf-
ferty was Johnny Mackorell.
Mackorell, who was a unani-
mous All-Stater and third
string All-America was star
quarterback at Davidson from
1933-35. In addition he was a
great shortstop on the base-
ball team.

coach commented, “This Mack-

I've ever seen.”

LAFFERTY

Oliver “Bo" Roddey put Dav-
idson College on the map in col-
legiate tennis circles from 1947
to 1950. During that span, Bo
lost two matches. Both were
close, hard-fought affairs with
UNC great Vic Seixas, who went
on to become world amateur
champion and a great profes-
sional star.

Clifford “Pat” Crawford
was an outstanding baseball
player at Davidson. After his
graduation in 1923, he went
on to play with the New York
Gients, The Cincinnati Reds,

and the Si. Louis Cardinals.
He was president of the
YMCA at Davidson, and his
contract with the Giants stip-

pulated that he wouldn’t play
on Sunday.

If Crawford wasn't the. best
baseball player ever at David-
son, he was second only to none
other than our own “Dutch”
Hengeveld. Hengeveld won
eighteen games on the mound
and—playing the outfield when
not pitching—hit .389 for the
old Little Rock club in 1921. At
the same time he was basketball
and baseball coach here. He
turned down a chance to play
major league ball to accept the
post of Registrar at Davidson.

in 1928 John Currie set a
Davidson College record that
still stands, and probably will
for quite some time. He ran
‘100 yards in 946 seconds,
which at the time was only .1
second off the world record.
For many years he also held
the school record in the 220
yard dash and the 440 yard
dash. In the summer of 1928,
he ran on a 440 yard. relay
team that established a new
world record.

A teammate of Currie's, and
perhaps his equal as a track
star, was Heath Whittle. Coach

ber that one boy put on his
card: Walking hither and

Whittle cackled and shook
all over. Then his eyes darted
back to the desk as he remem-
bered some other laughs the
coaches had.

“You've seen the track boys
pull off their sweatclothes be-
fore a meet,” he said. “Well,
about 15 years ago, we had a
boy pull off his shirt, then his
pants, only to find he wasn’t
wearing any shorts.”

Then there were the Peters

generally good. Students regu-
larly staged shirttail parades
and bonfires. The coaches and
players would get up and make
speeches.

For five or six years straight
Davidson and Wake Forest play-
ed to ties in football. When the
Wildcats broke the streak with
a win in 1932, “the students de-
clared a holiday for the next
day,” Whittle said. “But the
professors didn’t.

“Students formed a_ picket
line around Chambers to make
sure no one went to class. Fin-
ally one boy broke the line and
went to his class. He opened the
door and there was Dr. Douglas,

lecturing to an empty room.
‘Don't disturb me,’ he told the
student.”

Ameng ether college rules
which have gone their way,
Whittle recalled the “Bive
Lew” rule. “They didn’t like
fer us te make team trips on
Sunday,” he said. “Sometimes
they would permit it if we
went to church en route.”
This rule died out in the late
1920's.

In the 1930's students could
follow road games play-by-play
by means of a gridgraph set up
in Shearer Hall. As Whittle de-
scribed it, the gridgraph was a
large screen shaped like a foot-
ball field. A telegram would
come in every few minutes with
details of the game. Flashing
lights beside the players’ names
would tell who punted or passed
the ball and who caught it.
Whittle’s job was to move a
flashlight behind the screen to
show the movement of the ball.

“Everybody would get ex-
cited about who was going to
catch it. The women really

loved it because it showed
exactly what was going on,”
Whittle said.

When the Depression and
World War II came on, he said,
Davidson was very fortunate.
“They did not cut salaries here
in the early '30’s when many
other schools were doing it.
The highest paid professors at
South Carolina were getting
$1,800 a year instead of $3,600.
The same went for coaches. A
lot of boys in my class got jobs
at $15 to $30 a week. We had
only about half as many track
meets.

“But the number of football
games each year remained the
same, Under the old Athletic
Association, football receipts
paid half of the staff salaries
and the college paid the other
half. ‘

“Until the Depression the as-
sociation had money in the
bank. Then there was a deficit

mention in Ripley's Believe It all money went directly to the

brothers, George and Tommy,
who never failed, before each
basketball game, to take out
their chewing gum and deposit
it in the very same corner of
the court.

From about 1925 until 1940,
Davidson had three doctors at
every football game: Dr. Moore,
an obstetrician; Dr. Gaul, a bone
specialist; and Dr. McConnell,
the college physician.

“all three men would run out

by the way, always teld the

bebies during feetball games.

college.” ’

The beginning of heavy sub-
sidization at other colleges, plus
the Depression, hurt the per-
formances of Davidson teams
terribly.

“It was awful hard te sit
out there,” Whittle pointed,
“and see the teams losing.”

When the war came, he said,
“we found that many of our
boys were not physically fit to
go into service. We got them
out here to do vigorous cales-
thenics.

“Most all our students left
for the war. Mainly freshmen
were left. We were playing such
teams as Darlington (S.C.) High
School. One year only two stud-
ents graduated from Davidson.

“The Air Corps saved us. We
applied for the program to train
Air Corps cadets here. Many of
us on the athletic staff were
thus retained to train them. The
cadets would stay here for six
months and Davidson did a fine
job with them.”

The thing that sticks in Whit-
tle's mind about his 36-year
tenure here as student and
coach is “that more than any-
thing else we have tried to
maintain a fine athletic pro-
gram with plenty of competition
for our boys and required physi-
cal education. But we haven't
gotten excited about going big
time. And we haven't lowered
our academic standards.

“Look what happened to
Washington and Lee (which
did both). They lost their
shirts. The boys had to cheat
to stay in school and two
standards came into being.
However, they are back in
line now.

“Anybody at Davidson can
participate in sports. About 40
per cent of the student. body
takes part in_ intercollegiate
sports and 85 per cent partici-
pate in intramurals (a program
for which Whittle gets most of
the credit).

“Our intramural program
started with Capt. Pritchard.
The boys divided up between
dormitories. When I came here
more than half the students
were Independents. Fraternities
were not too large, Around 1930
they began to get bigger as they
moved into eating houses and
our program grew.”

The Davidson sports line-up
has not changed much since

established here as Lake Nor-
man is filled.

But only the immediate fu-
ture was in Whittle’s mind. It
was getting on toward 3 p.m.
and he excused himself for
track practice.

Duke, Thad Brock ran 102 yards mae

He was attempting to punt from

rushed him, he wiggled and ran

fore being tackled.
