Football Gleanings

Dope Spilled in Several Contests
Last Saturday

Georgia Tech. is beaten. The Vir-
_ginia Generals are heirs to the football
supremacy in the South, For four years
the Yellow Jackets have held this title
only to lose it last Saturday by a 3 to ©
count.

The Golden Tornado started the
game off with a rush and once a fumble
was made as the runner was crossing the
goal line. On another occasion Bill
Fincher fumbled a pass on the two-yard
line that Buck Flowers had shot to him
with unerring accuracy. On still an-
other occasion Flowers missed a drop
kick.

As the game progressed W. & L.
strengthened and ‘Tech weakened. With
the exception of one march up the field
the Jackets did not make a first down in
the last half. and only gained three yards
in all. Washington & Lee, on the oth-
er hand, gained consistently and exe4
cuted forward passes beautifully, Tech's
lone march up the field in the last half
occurred when she secured the ball under
the shadow of her goal and carried it
far into enemy territory. Here her
strength was spent, and defeat was ac-
cepted.

Bethel, who played in the line for
W. & L., was the star of the game, put-
ting up a spectacular defense. Jim Mat-
tox kicked the drop kick from the 25-
yard line which won the game.

Georgetown defcated the strong Navy
team Saturday by the score of 6 to o.
This was a great surprise in football
circles.

The Georgetown cleven is. headed for
Atlanta Saturday and the Golden Tor-
nado will, according to all dope, suffer
another defeat ‘The outlook is dark for
Tech at any rate. Georgetown is equip-
ped with all the formations and tricks

Class Basketball Gets Under
Way This Week

Many Close Contests Anticipated--
Juniors and Sophs Are Ap-
parently the Best Bets

Inter-dormitory basketball has paved
the way for an interesting series of class
games which will begin soon. Basket-
ball is coming to the front :more and
more each year, and this is largely be-
cause Mr., Miles is behind: ite ‘Lhe best
men were picked for the intee-dormitory
games and the managers of the class
teams will have little difficulty in pick-
ing their men froni-these. Lot

Askew, one of last year’s stars, is ‘to
lead the. Senior team this year. He has |
a very limited number to choose from, |
as Chalmers and Hall joined the Varsity |
last year and Lacy McAlister is playing

football. ‘The other prospects are, Haw- Gridiron Warriors to Receive

kins, Craig, Wilson, Stogner and Good.

The Junior téim also gave up two’

good players, Shenck and Harrington,
to the Varsity last year. Sfill"they have
left Brice, Finley, Ormand, A. P., King

and Oltman. | All these are good players _

and are going to play somebody close for
another championship.

The Sophomore class has practically all
its las: year's force and several new men.
The men showing up good for this team
are, Doubles, Ormand, A. C., Price,
Cornelson, the Erwin Bros., and Stri-
licch. This team is going to give the

Juniors trouble, and then will probably !

take the championship from them.

The Freshmen have some good ma-
terial and will no doubt put out a good
team. The ones who showed up well
in the inter-dormitory games are, Craw-
ford, Mauze, Tuller, Dick, Brake, Far-
mer, Covington and others.

The series began ‘Tuesday and in-
creasing interest and pep is being mani-
fested from game to game.

The schedule is as follows:

Nov. 11—Juniors vs. Fresh.

Nev. 12—Seniors vs. Sophs.

Gold Footballs

Funds Being Raised to Secure Re-

wards for Pigskin Letter Men

At the suggestion of Tim Pharr, who
has been assisting Coach Crayton with
the football team, a fund ,is being raised
for the purpose of giving every member
of the team a gold football. “The idea at
first was to have just the ex-stars con-

tribute, but it was thought ‘better to
leave it open for all the alumni.
Coach Pharr has very generously
‘started the fund with a ten-dollar sub-
scription and athers have signified their
intention of contributing. This is a cus-

tom that should have been started long |¢

ago and it is hoped that. the necessary
amount will soon be raised. Mr. F. L.
Jackson, registrar, will be glad to re-
ceive your check.
