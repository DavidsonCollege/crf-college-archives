Forum, from page I :

Maryanne Warner ‘03 agreed that there is
a need for more ways to get off campus.

and that does not help people without cars.”

The SGA is also working to establish a
Lake Campus shuttle so more students will
utilize Davidson’s private lakeshore.

An Alcohol committee, including Health
Educator Georgia Ringle, gave a lengthy
presentation on how to improve the types of
alcohol education on campus. “There were
many specific suggestions about how we can
improve the content and style of our alcohol
programs,” explained Vagt. One of the sug-
gestions involved improving the relevance of
mandatory Lifestyles Speakers; others re-

educate the campus.

Another committee, including Dean Kathy
Bray-Merrell, the Associate Dean of Stu-
dents, centered around the relationship be-
tween faculty members and Patterson Court.
“Students expressed an interest in increasing
the number of opportunities for quality inter-
actions between faculty and the Court. Gen-
erally students were very positive when de-
scribing their relationships with professors in
the classroom setting. However, the students
in the group are eager to expand those rela-
tionships to activities and conversations be-
yond the academic arena,” commented Bray-
Merrell.

Warner, who was one of the presenters,
explained, “We need to discuss some new
ways to encourage student/faculty relations,
outside of only aclassroom setting.” Sugges-
tions included ‘having more daytime activi-
ties which faculty members with families can
more easily attend and more receptions after
speakers. a

Additionally, this committee touched on
the relationship between students and their
advisors. SGA President Gray Patterson
recently brought up the issue of students who

feel that their advisors are less than helpful.
Vagt said that faculty members agreed with
many of Pattéerson’s comments, but felt that
the problem — and its solution — was a two-
way street. :

One of the issues that had come up at the
earlier social forums was a perceived split
between the Union and Patterson Court. Stu-
dents expressed concern that the campus was
becoming divided between those who choose
to attend Union Board events and those who
prefer the traditional Court party atmosphere.

“There is going to be more coordination
between the Union Board and Patterson Court
organizations,” explained Vagt. “This does
not mean that if something’s going on one
place, there will be nothing at the other place.
It’s important that there be options. But they
will work on hosting more things together,”
and not scheduling major events in competi-
tion with one another.

Warner expressed both appreciation for
the forums and optimism for their future. “I
believe [the forums] show dedication to im-
proving life for Davidson students, faculty,
and staff inside and outside of the Chambers
building.

“T hope the topics discussed will be ad-
dressed again in the fall and that we can
reassess the changes that can improve and
maintain the community atmosphere of the
current social structure at Davidson.”

Bray-Merrell was also enthusiastic about
the potential for the forums to improve cam-
pus life. “In my opinion, the power of the
social forums is in providing a venue for
students to both brainstorm how they want to
change the nature of social life at Davidson
and to find the means to take ownership over
the process.”

“Nobody had waited to get back together
to start doing stuff. That was true in every
group,” claimed Vagt, who saw much initia-
tive on the part of forum participants. “The
worst thing that can happen is that people’s
wishes go unexpressed . . . we need to know
what’s on people’s minds.”
