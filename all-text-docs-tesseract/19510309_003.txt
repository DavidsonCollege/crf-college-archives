THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREB

Hang Your Hat At Hugos

By NAT DANIELS

Our dissertation this week could
be more appropriately titled “Nat's
Nook,” or some similar designa-
tion, in that it has a little to do
with the embellishment of or de-
traction from the civic pride of the
town of Davidson. Due to a certain
feeling of repulsion at putting out
another “satirical” column so close
on the heels of last week’s defense
of the Post Office, I decided to
break into a trend and just spout
off in general.

CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
THE CYNIC

In wandering over the campus
for the past two and a half years, I
have stopped laughing at my own
attempts at humor and attracting
the attention of my betters long
enough to notice that there exists
at Davidson a type of individual
whose personality can best be sum-
med up and deseribed in a single
word—cynicism.

Cynicism as a personality factor
can be found in small doses in the
best of us, in somewhat larger
amounts in the worst of us and in
varving degrees in the rest of us.
However, it seems to express itself
most freely in the type of person
commonly described as béing a—
well, a cynic, or from the cynic’s
point of view, a realist.

Life, for the cynic is rather dis-
couraging. He is convinced that all
the faults of the world around him
are incurable, that any attempts
at such cures are absurd, and that
the situation of things in general
should evoke, no more response
from the “thinking” person than a
bitter chuckle. In short, manners,
ethics, and morals are only fig-
ments of mankind's wildest dreams.

About here. the typical cynic will
cackle sarcastically and say, “that’s
not cynicism, but objective and
realistic thinking.”

It may be pointed out that the
main difference between a realist
and a cynic is that the realist is
able to see his own faults and
weaknesses as well as those of the
institutions and individuals within
his environment.

The first of two types of cynics
which I have noted is the disillu-
sioned idealist, or one whose stand.
ards have been set so high that
nothing within his earthly environ-
ment can meet up to them, because
of certain weaknesses inherent in
human nature, and human nature
controls, to a certain extent, that
environment. Take for a familiar
example, the student who, when he
enters Davidson, is convinced that
alt is sweetness and light on the
campus, and that gambling, drink-
ing, sex, and similar evils don’t ex-
ist in such Christian atmosphere,
His mother is probably relieved to
know that her little son will be
sheltered from the cold, cruel world
for four more years, (And she is
partially right). The net result is
that his first poker game, and his
first invitation to visit Iredell
County, shatters his faith in men
and morals with such a jolt that he
makes the mistake of believing that
‘because his old ideals are shattered,
no others are good enough, and
flexible standards don't exist. He
gets disgusted with the piety of his
mother, his preacher, and his more
religiously-minded friends, becomes

convinced that it is only a front,
and believes that an inveterate, but
open and honest sinner is a much
more noble character than the nom-
inal Christian. He should remem-
ber that, as C. S. Lewis once said,
“We shouldn't want to be either.”

The second type of cynic I have
noticed is the individual with few
ethics, few morals, and practically
no inhibitions, His cynicism is the
hardest to uproot, and the only
things that prevent me from say.
ing it is inherited are the fact that
no parents that cynical themselves
would have ever gotten married in
the first place, and the influence of
certain environmentalists in the
Psychology depart z.ent.

No matter how worthy a cause
is, or how much effort has been

Bruno: “I Deserve a Cup

I had been told trying to get
Bruno Frye to talk about himself
was about as hard to do as a tap
dance in tennis shoes—underwater.
He simply wouldn't do it. “Aw
Mike, some of the boys around the
house could tell you more about
me than I can.” The more I stuck
around the more I realized this
must be true. By fooking around
the room at his books I could tell
he was a senior from Asheville

but little more. I was getting no-
where and not even very fast, I
tried everything but still we sat
staring at each other. I made one
final effort.

put into a seemingly futile attempt, | i

how beautiful the day, or how good
looking somebodv else’s date is
our friend can always find an ap-
propriate and cheering word, and
he vents forth without hesitation.
He may point out that the advoca-

tors of the cause plan to use it for ].:

their own benefit (as he would do
in their position), that the attempt
was absurd in the first place, that
the warmth and sin only sérve to
turn the campus into a sea of grassy
mud, and that he knows and dates
plenty of girls, with more brains,
more personality, and inmost import-
ant of all, more money.

Very similar to, but not closely
related to the forms of life so far
described is the pseudo-cynic, and
he, I believe really predominates in
our student body. He has high but
not unattainable ideals, broad, but
unbreakable moral standards, and a
sense of values—the only trouble
is, he hates to admit it. Maybe he
thinks he’s being different, when
actually he looks ridiculow, or
maybe he thinks he can become
identified with some of the true
cynics and achieve a certain «is-
tinction as a_ typical iconoclast.
However it must be said to his
credit that when the going gets
tough, the chips are down, and the
enemy is closing in, he digs in,
plays his cards straight, throws
down his flimsy shield and pulls
out his bayonet.

And so the cynics and their fel-
low travelers wend their sad way
down the road of life, oblivious to
the beauty of the world about
them, the humanity of man, and the
majesty of God.

College Quirks

A professor of English at North-
western University reports that
more Northwestern women smoke
than do men. A survey revealed
that 60 per cent of the girls smcke,
as opposed to 52 per cent of the
men.

A further increase in women
smokers, warns the professor, will
drive the American male, who is
sensitive about his masculinity, to
cutplug and marijuana.

The “bed check” also proved that
out of 176 girls in one dormitory,
13 sleep in nighties, while the rest
prefer pajamas. No one was re-
ported to sleep in her slip or birth-
daysuit.

First Accurate Life Of Madison
Received This Week§In Library

Dr. Chalmers Davidson, college
librarian, announced the arrival .of
five new books recently. These in-
clude the first two volumes of Irving
Brant’s authentic fife of James
Madison. George Allen’s Presidents
Who Have Known Me, and two
novels: A Breath of Air and Unto
These Hills round out the list.

Brant, in attempting to compile
an authentic life of Madison, has
undertaken a monumental task.
First of the two volumes received,
James Madison, Father of the Con-
stitution, 1780-1787, deals with
Madison's vital relation to the Con-
stitution and Bill of Rights. Brant
treats Madison’s putting the Fed.
eral government to work under the
Constitution and establishing a
Democratic Party.

Contemporaries of Madison are
not dealt with as demi-gods, but as
men innocent of selfishness, yet
swayed by political and economic
pressures.

We receive a clear insight into
the framing and ratification of
our Great Constitution in James
Madison, the Nationalist, 1787-1800.
Madison here emerges as the master
strategist of the Continental Con.
gress and as a great Virginian who
put the founding of a strong central
government above all.

This second book throws much
light on the American type of gov-

ernment, It spotlights information
which was hitherto either misunder-
stood or haphazardly recorded.

President’s Who Have Know Me
is an unprecedented mixture of good
humor, shrewd political analyses
and inside stories. We get a quick
look into the inside political work.
ings of our government. It’s hard
to quit laughing, but once one has,
onc can learn a lot about the gov-
ernment.

Too Much Profanity
Observed By Editor

_ There’s entirely too much pro.
fanity around here. This was the
opinion of the Contraband, student
newspaper of McNeese State Col-
lege, Lake Charles, La,

The Contraband complained, “Too
often, as one walks down the halls
of M.S.C., he hears a word or
phrase which gives him the feeling
that something is lacking in the
speaker's culture. The use of pro-
fanity implies that a person docs
not have a vocabulary sufficient for
expressing himself . . . When visi-
tors on campus hear objectionable
language, it may give rise to un-
favorable comment regarding Mc.
Neese students in general.”

BRUNO

“Well, I guess I can’t tell ’em
about your missing teeth.” I start-
ed toward the door.

It worked! I had found his weak
spot, yet ‘his pride and joy! In a
flash he slammed the door, whipped
out several scrapbooks and started
chattering like a ticker-tape ma-
chine. “You can’t leave out the
teeth angle,” he said flipping them
skillfully with his tongue so I'd
know they weren't his. “At ROTC
camp when it was hard to get any-
one for pictures they would ask
Major Sample whose picture to
put in the papers and he would
say ‘simple, Bruno is the man’ and
all because I didn't have any teeth.”

crown from Marge Olds, Pan-Hel

president, had just introduced
Groat’s eleven competitors, each
escorted by the sponsoring sorori-
ty’s representatives on the Pan.

A favorite from the beginning,
Groat showed his ahility to pile up
votes (as well as record-breaking
field ‘goal and free throw totals) in
the week-long promotion cam.
paign which came to an end last
Monday night when East Campus
voted by dorms.

During the previous week nu-
merous posters had appeared
through the campus — in the
Dope Shop, on blackboards, and
in secluded cortiers—requesting
votes for favorite candidates. Using
Parliament cigarettes as__ their
medium, Alpha Delta Pi pushed
Groat’s familiar No. 10 to an easy
victory.

I was beginning to think the com-
ma should have been left out of the
preceeding sentence. “Some camp
that was. Never will forget... .”

Now I was trying to edge in a
word. “But how?” -

“How? Playing football. Played
for Asheville—that's where I'm
from you know—wonderful town
Asheville. Never played quite Ist
string. One day I was warming up
in practice tripped over water buck-
et...”

I moved my chair nearer the
door which I prefered to have open.

He went on reminiscing about
the ‘good ole football days.’ How
he did this and that, then paused
briefly for a gasp of air.

T was alert and had my word
ready. I grabbed the break and
shouted “fraternity?”

“Best sports manager SPF. ever

roommate, you know—we — sorta
got a little competition going for
Sport's Manager of the Year. The
fraternities ought to give a cup for
the best manager anyhow. Don't
know where I'd put it though. Yes
sir, the football boys have, their
‘cruel Crowell’ but the SPE’s have
their brutal Bruno. T never will
forget the game when" “ROTC

We were off to the races again.
“Nobody there will ever forget the
time we had fire drill and I was
taking a shower, had to balance
that towel and carry an M-I! in one
hand and ‘fire extinguisher in the
other. Then the towel began slip-
ping. 1 knew if 1 dropped that M-1
to grab the towel it would mean
clean-up duty in the fatrine. What

tally, ‘heads’ or ‘tails. It was. ‘tails’
so | grabbed the towel just in time
to cover my sonrthern exposure and
took the ‘head’ consequence.”

} thought it time to chanye the
subject so shouted “school work?”

Here he quieted down, The pur-
ple in his eyes faded into their
natural pale green. The foam left
his lips.

“You know,” he started calmly,
“T like Davidson. I like it a lot. In
fact the other three children in
my family went to Carolina.” For-
getting where I was I hissed. “But
a minister back home told me about
Davidson (I'm going to Union Sem-
inary next year, you know) Still I
don’t think DPve ever looked for
ward to anything like I'm looking
forward to this June. I live for
graduation day.” I could tell he
was dead serious. “But I’ve had a
lot of fun here. Particularly the
fire cracker dub. Yes sir, Bo (Sim-
mons) 'n Phil (Davis) and I were
behind it all and we don't. mind ad-
mitting it. We were well organized
too. Had meetings and even mock
council meetings where we would
make little figures of council mem-
bers, stick pins in ‘em, then burn
them in effigy. Poor Phit his gone
now, though. Probably now in a
higher league like fixing basketball
games or something, But he can
always say he got his start in ole
Bruno's room,”

1 could tell by the catch in his
voice he wouldn't be able to go
on much longer. There were other
incidences in this man’s life: his
falling in love with ROTC Sgt.
being the Gussie Moran of the
tennis courts, Phenix City night-
club—but now they all. seemed.too
trivial to bring up. He stared blank.
ly at a parafin covered bottle. I
knew his soul was with Phil and
Bo and the club. Reverently I
slipped out of the room of the boy
‘who wouldn't talk about himself.’

77) Alpha Epsilon Delta Commemorates

Historic Silver Anniversary

Alpha Epsilon Delta, national
premedical honor society, will cele-
brate twenty-five silver years of
service to premedical students ac-
cording to Gene Regen, Jr., Presi-
dent of the North Carolina Alpha
Chapter at Davidson College, this
month. Growth from an organiza-
tion of a few for intellectual and
social recognition and satisfaction
to a national organization with
broad educational programs for the
many is the history of AED. To
achieve maturity. and to make a
contribution of worth to education
and to society any organization has
to grow. That Alpha Epsilon Delta
has done in these twenty-five years.
AED has grown in numbers and in
service, .

The goal and the achievement of
AED has been and is its contribu.
tion and cncouragement to students
and to the advancement of pre.
medical education. A number of
national projects promote.:this goal,
this objective. The First National
Conferetice on Premedical Fduca-
tion was held in cooperation with
the Association of American Medi
cal Colleges at Lake Placid, New
York, in Octoker 1950. Three reg-
ional conferences have bightighted
AED activity in different sections
of the nation, these conferences
being -held at the University of
Louisville, University of Colorado
and Syracuse University. Ameri-
can Association for the Advance.
ment of Science and the American
Chemical Society have gladly. spon-
sored national symposia and dis-
cussion groups at various mectings,
These different occasions on Which
educators in all areas of premedical
education have brought together by
Alpha Epsilon Delta to nveet. with
medical educators to discuss and
perhaps solve inany amuthal prob-
lems reveal the developnient of the
program of service hy AED lead.
ers in these recent years.

State-wide meetings for premedi-
cal students have helped to imple-
ment a primary purpase of the
Society:. the binding together of
students of similar interests; the
bridging of the gap between pre-
medical and, medical students and
schools; and the provision of a
means of recognition for students
of high scholastic attainment and
character,

Established in 1926, Alpha Epsi-
lon Delta is now.a nationally recog-
nized honor society of highest rank
with a menibership of nearly ten
thousand in approximately 60 stu.

dent chapters. It is an affiliated
society of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Sci-
ence, an associate member of the
American Council on Education,
and a member of the Association
of College Honor Societies. The
N, C. Alpha Chapter was installed
on this campus in 1936,

The strength’ of Alpha Epsilon
Delta lies in its local chapters, in
active student participation. Every
chapter has an educational pro.
gram with promotion of the educa-
tional advancement and Tecognition
of premedical students as its goal.
Chapter activities include meetings
with. distinguished guest speakers,
dinner forums, showing of films
of medical nature and trips to hos-
pitals and medical schools.

Founded in the South, Alpha
Epsilon Delta will meet in Ninth
National Convention at the Univer-
sity of Alabama, home of the moth-
er chapter, to celebrate this silver
anniversary in March 1951. Theme
of the niectings will be the impor-
tance of premedical education as
an intégral part of the training of
the future physician. The commem-
oration of AED's founding will be
an event at which the Society will
take stock of the future as well as

‘the past. Alpha Epsilon Delta must

prepare for new responsibilities,
niust bend every effort to realize its
potentialities, must prove _ itself
ready for a golden future.
