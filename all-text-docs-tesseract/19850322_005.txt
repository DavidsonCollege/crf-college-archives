“Do I look chic?” asks Nikki
Giovanni as she looks out at an at-
tentive 900-Room audience. The
audience is at first inclined to
chuckle, for she, wearing gray
bell-bottomed trousers, a long
purple tie and a knitted cap on her
head, seems an image out of the
seventies. She knows how we per-
ceive her, and yet through her
simple exchange she reveals that
her concept of “chic” has little to
do with clothing.

Nikki Giovanni, once called
“the princess of black poetry,”
spent last Wednesday and Thurs-
day at Davidson as part of the
1985 Martin Luther King Lecture
Speaker Series. She has authored
or co-authored twelve poetry
books, one of which, Gemini,
earned a nomination in 1973 for a
National Book Award. Through
and beyond her poetry she is re-
spected as a leading equal rights
activist.

Though Giovanni read several
of her poems during her Wednes-
day-night presentation, she spent
much of the evening voicing her
opinions. With a frank, comic and
often caustic style she addressed
problems of race and sex discrimi-

_ nation in America.

She denounced American-led
boycotts of the South African gov-
ernment, calling them insignific-
ant. “If you want to picket the
government of South Africa,” she
said, “go where it is. Go to Pre-
toria. We need to confront it with
some risk to ourselves.”

Giovanni explained that while
she deplores the apartheid govern-

ment, she nevertheless finds the
boycotts and restrictions sup-
ported by such organizations as
Transafrica potentially danger-
ous. “What we need to do in
America is make sure peace is
maintained [in South Africa]. I
don’t know why people are trying
to destabilize the most economi-

cally sound nation on the conti-
nent.”

Giovanni next directed her
presentation to the problems of
blacks struggling to progress in a
predominantly white American
society. Addressing blacks in the
audience in particular she said:
“Go do something. Anytime you
want something, you’re going to
have to do more to get it. Don’t let
somebody that didn’t want you
here in the first place ruin your
world.”

At’ certain) moments — she
seemed hardened, almost angry,
while at other times her tone was
light and cheerful as she looked
optimistically to the future. In a
somewhat sardonic mixture of
those features, she remarked, “I
know that when we get our first
martian, we will all come together
as earthlings.” Then as an after-
thought, she said, “Why is it al-
ways a tragedy that brings us to-
gether?”

At the close of her presenta-
tion, Walli Williams of Charlotte
rose to contradict her views to-
ward South Africa. While
Giévanni immediately turned and
left through the 900 Room’s rear
exit, Williams continued addres-
sing the audience members who
remained to listen. “My principles
can’t be bought,” he said.

Stella Nkomo of Charlotte
said that she came with Williams
to defend the boycotting policies
that Giovanni so vehemently
criticizes. “[Giovanni] has a his-
tory of taking a negative position
on apartheid. What Transafrica is
doing is very important. Nikki is
speaking to a good many people
who aren’t aware of the situation.
It’s an insult to their intelligence.”

When she spoke again on
Thursday morning, Giovanni fo-
cused on Nikki the artist. Discus-
sing the young writer, she be-
moaned the fact that writers are
not encouraged to grow. “It hap-

audience With Artistic, Political Viewpoints

pens all the time with American
writers,” she said. “We say, ‘Now
that you've done it, do it again.’
Mostly writing is the art of mat-
uration. Art is not an athletic pur-
suit. To be an artist you have to
have something behind you, so
the older we get, the better we
write.”

Giovanni said she does be-
lieve her poetry is accessible to
everyone, black and white. The
problem, she said repeatedly, is
that of “knee-jerking people's
lives,” or hastily categorizing
them. “I think I can be read and
understood. and all it takes is a
heart.”

Nikki Giovanni steps away
from the podium on Thursday
morning wearing what appears to
be the same outfit she wore the
night before. The blouse is a new
one, she assures us.

It doesn't really matter,
though—for Nikki Giovanni is
chic.

Wocehouse’s Multi-Faceted Jeeves Delights Audience

By ALLISON WILLS
Wednesday night's — Artist
Series production of  P.G.

Wodehouse’s “Jeeves Takes
Charge,” kept the audience in a
perpetual state of laughter. British
actor Edward Duke brilliantly
portrays Bertie Wooster, an indul-
gent, crass “man about town” and
his presumptuous — gentleman's

gentleman, Jeeves, as well as 10
other eccentric personalities.

Edward Duke as Bertie

The one-man, two-act play
adapted by Duke and set in Lon-
don in the 1930s, narrates the es-
capades of the master/servant
team using Bertie’s biting yet in-
sightful wit. Faced with unreason-
able demands from his fiancé,
older relatives and unsightly ac-
quaintances, Bertie calls upon
Jeeves to maintain his sanity, and
Jeeves responds with a superior
wit usually aimed at Bertie’s lack
of taste.

Among the characters in-
cluded in what is considered
Wodehouses's best-loved crea-
tion are Madeline Basset, the
woman God forgot; Gussie Fink-
Nottle, the newt lover (newts re-
semble small frogs); Edwin, the
kind, but curious, boy scout; and
his bossy aunts best described as
“totally unfit for human consump-
tion.”

Bertie Wooster, the narrator
of the “Jeeves” stories, 1s 24 years
old. He is unemployed and appar-
ently dependent on rich relatives
who finance his gambling, riding,
squash, motoring and smoking
concerts (drunken bashes held at
his gentleman's club, ~The
Drones). He has, however, writ-
ten an article on “What the Well-
Dressed Man is Wearing” in
Milady's Boudoir, an unending
source of amusement for Jeeves
with his immaculate taste.

Reginald Jeeves served as a
valet, butler and personal gentle-
man in some of the finest homes in
London before working for Ber-
tie. He ts a specialist in correct
dress and potent “pick-me-ups.”
Jeeves spends most of his time
getting Bertie out of trouble by
helping him handle his love life
and bothersome aunts, and often
he intervenes acting in Bertie’s
“best interest.”

Their interaction is delightful,
and the two hours would be suffi-
ciently entertaining tf no other
characters were introduced.

Because of the nature of
Wodehouse’s humor, following
every word is essential to catching
its subtleties, but Duke's rapid
speech compounded by — his
switching characters frequently
made some of the comments difft-
cult to follow. Consequently, the
audience seemed to miss several
biting remarks
