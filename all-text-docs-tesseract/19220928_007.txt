The Voice |

4

‘The average person is more susceptible to
the change of tone in the voice than to any
selected set of words,

A fusillade of unpleasant words can he
lired with a smile in the voice and they will
be accepted as an evidence of cordial friend-
ship. ‘The meanest name that a man ever
called me was spoken while the man was
smiling—and | know the man likes me. The
sweetest thing ever said to me was a darned
lie. Words are but tools—the voice conveys
the meaning.

The tone of a voice tells whether you are
friendly or looking for a fight. The voice is
the vice or the virtue uf a man’s meaning.
The sound of the human voice betrays the
speaker, for the sound comes from the soul,
while words fly off the tonguc.

The quality of a voice is singularly ef-
fecting. An insult in words can be so clothed | B
that it affords no excuse for resentment. It
is not se much what you say as how you
suy it. .A sentence may have two meanings,
depending on the inflection of one word.

We often see a grin on the face of a
hyena, but there is never a smile in the voice
of a hedgehog.

A sincere, sober, straight face with a smile
in the voice, beats a strained grin with a
stiletto in the boot.

T repeat, “The average person | is more sus-
ceptible to the change of tone in the voice
than to any selected set of words."—Honcy
Comb Briefs.

My fife was never destined to be quite
happy. It was laid along lines which I could
not foresce, almost from earliest childhood.
It has left me with nothing to hope for, with

‘Tnothing definite to seck or strive for. In-

herited wealth is a hig handicap to happi-
ness. It is as certain death to ambition as
cocaine is to morality.
1f a man has made moncy, no matter how
much, he finds a certain happiness in its pos-
session, for in the desire to increase his busi-
ness he has a constant use for it. But the
man who inherits it has none of this. The
first satisfaction, and the greatest, that of
building the foundation of a fortune, is
denied him. He must labor, if he does labor,
simply to add to an over-sufficiency.—Wil-
liam K. Vanderbilt.

Behind the wall sat Mademoiselle before
