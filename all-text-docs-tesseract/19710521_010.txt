The administration this
year has been receptive bo
most of the resolutions paiss-
ed by ‘the student Seniate. Un-
der the presidential leader-
ship of Ran Coble and Dan-
ny Clodfelter the senate
pushed tihrough  selif-sched-
uled exams ‘and ithe new
physical
ments.

Next fall under -Clodfelter’s
active leadership the senate
will propose the representa-
tion of students on two fiacul-
ty committees, release their
report on ia governiance sys-
tem involving \a college: coun-
cil, ‘and push for open fac-
ulty meetings.

The Senate ha's been an: ef-
fective fiorce jin helping to
reorder thie priorities of the
college.

Probably the biggest
change this year at David-
son, however, was brought
about by ‘College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. In co-
operation with ‘the trustees,
Spencer proposed and iinsti-
tuted a system of nonselec-
itive eating clubs to replace
fraternities.

Of all the changes this
year, ihe social system issue
was the- most controversial

but ithe result is difficult to.

analyze.

One development which thie
social system issue has
‘brought to light is the wild
paranoid which the wild

agree with what he has done,
but few ‘agree wiith hits meth-
ods.

In short the students do
not trust the prssicens of the
‘college.

Maybe next year Spencer
should try to break through

Clinical Psychologist Hall

It now appears that Dr.
Merideth Hall will again
provide his services as a

clinical psychologist at
Davidson next year, taccord-
ing to junior Cecil Burney.

Burney and rising senior
Tom Robertson have con-
tvacbed mumerous people ;to
get information on
ing services. They determin-
ed ‘after much investigation
that Hall would be ‘the best
person for tihe job.

Burney emphasized . that
‘the hiring is being done
solely with student funds
since the administration has
shown no willingness to pro-
vide funds for these psy-
chological. services for mext

He stated ithat Hall’ s role

react more flavonably to him.

Despite the improvements
of the year, iit has become
clear that the various power
groups on dGampus do not
trust each other. The stu-
dents have become the chiam-
pions of Jegallism whille the
faculty retreat to the warm
security of ithe flaculty con-
stitution.

Neither group will commit

itself to anything. The col-
lege may have giained

very imnovatiive men inm,its
administration, but iit hats
continued to loose a sense: of
commnuuniitty.

Meredith Hail, the clinical .
psychologist, explains that
Davidson ts an asylum for
very lonely people wiith each
student trying ito be one up

Maybe tthe people at this
institution next year should
concentrate on building trust

community back together.

This situation is so critical
that a suspension of classes
for one day next fall might
be in order so thatthe ad-
ministration, faculty and stu-
dents can ‘sit down on the

only the academic future of
college, but also the future

is not to replace Dr. William
G. Workman, whom the col-
lege has engaged for coun-
seling, but rather to augment
the services offered to stu-
dents.

hired yet, jhe thas agreed ‘to
sign a contract for next year.
The extent of his work will
depend on the amount of
money that can be raised.

‘Burney. stated thiat hope-
fully $6,000 will be raised
(which was ‘the amount Halll
received last year), and
pointed to severtal sources of
funds.

“We have a commitment
for $1,000 in surplus funds
from this year's student gov-
ernment budget. Monday
night, the senate approved
this money to be used to
hire Hall.

“In addition, the SGA re-
quested $2,000 from mext
year’s budget be tappropriat-
ed from the student activi-
ties fee to pay for Hall's
services.”’

Bumey said he hoped to
get two or three thousand
dollars more from the Unio
Board. He will meet wiih
them, next Monday.

One thousand dollars has
also been requested from
next year's budget of the
Activities Gnant Foundation.

To Stay On At Davidson

Hopefully, Hiall will oper-
ate in three capacities, ac-
cording to Burney. ‘He will
continue the individual ther-
apy vas he did this year, and
he will also conduct group
meetings of various sorts.

‘In addition, he will pos-
sibly be used us ia part-time
consultant to varigus student

‘Burney emphasized that
having two psychologists
“will give:each man the op-
portunity to reflect more

’ intensely on the needs of

studenits ‘and to find ways to
meet those needs.’’

“I 1am also particularly
gratified that some staff
members of the college thave
offered to contribute funds
for this project,’ Burney
stated.
