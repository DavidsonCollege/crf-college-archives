Fraternity Tournament
Survived by Six Teams

Semi-Finals and Finals to be Played
This Week and Next

During the past week the first round of
the inter-fraternity basketball tournament
was played off and-five teams emerged vic-
torious. These were the teams representing

Kappa Phi, Kappa Sigma, Theta Upsilon
Omega. The Phi Gamma Deltas drew a
bye for the first round. All but one of the
games were featured by guarding,
which resulted in small scores.

The second round of the tournament will
be played this week. The Phi Gams won
from Theta Chi last night; the S. A. E.s will
play T. U. O. tonight and the Kappa Sigs
will meet the Pi Kappa Phis tomorrow night.
The final round will be played next week.
So far the S. A. E.s'and the Phi Gams have
shown best form.

In the first game to be played the T. U
O.s won from the Betas by the score of 8-6.
The guarding on both sides was very close
and neither team was able to find the basket
