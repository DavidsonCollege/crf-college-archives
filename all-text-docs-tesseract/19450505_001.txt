Talk Made By
R. H. Lafferty

: Noted Cancer Specialist Ad-
_ dresses Students

In the regular chapel -exercises
at Davidson College, April 18, guest
speaker Dr. R. H. Lafferty, leading
roentgenologist of Charlotte, addres-
sed the assembled student body on
the subject “Current Developments
in the Treatment of Gancer.” An
alumnus of the college class of 1899,
the speaker was introduced by
President John R. Cunningham,
who remarked on Dr. Lafferty’s
hobby of “growing flowers as well
as his interest in growing boys and
girls”. The latter referred to his
leadership as superintendent of Sun-
day School in the Second Presby-
terian Church. Dr. Lafferty empha-
sized the fact that the discovery of
the X-ray, which, so far-as-is known
was first used in this country at
Davidson College in 1895, has con-
tributed very much to our knowl-
edge and treatment of cancer. Nev-
ertheless, our knowledge of the
+dread disease is yet to a.great ex-
tent limited, and new discoveries
are eagerly awaited. Today cancer
takes more toll of human life in
this country than any other malady
except perhaps heart failure. Other
wars in our nation’s past have been
accompanied by frightfully - fatal
diseases, but all have been conquer-
ed. Cancer has not yet been con-
trolled.

Dr. Lafferty stated that although

Pan-Hell Calls
OffOneDance

Informal Function Is Success;
No More Dances

On Friday, April 13th, the first
of the Spring Frolics dances was
held between the hours of 8:30 and
12:00 in the gymnasium.
Music for the dance was furnished
by a piccolo, and the Gymnasium
was attractively decorated with
pastel colored crepe paper stream-
ers, lawn furniture, flower-covered
trellises, and floor lamps.

Preceding the dance, the Y cabi-
net sponsored a picnic supper which
was served in: the stadium, and to
which the entire student body and
their dates were invited.

Due to the’ death of the Presi-
dent, and President Truman’s dec-
laration of a-national day of mourn-
ing, it was decided that the Satur-
day night dance should be can-

college

celled, and it was supplemented by

informal parties in the fraternity
houses. At ten o'clock Saturday
night, the students and their dates
assembled in the YMCA for a brief
prayer service, and refreshments.
This concluded the plans for the
week-end, which, considering. the
Situation, was quite successful.

Due to the full schedule for the
remainder of the Spring, it was
deemed advisable not to attempt
to have another Spring dance, so
it seems that the social events of
the school year have come to a
very successful end.
