Vacation robberies damper New Year

Two off-campus houses on Armour Street
belonging to Davidson students and three Se-
nior Apartments were robbed sometime over
Winter Break.

According to Sgt. David Howie of the
Davidson Police Department, there are no offi-
cial suspects in the Armour Street incident.

Tim Robertson ’04, one of the off-campus
robbery victims, said the items stolen from his
house included a Play Station, DVDs and tele-
visions. Howie said that at least two computers
had been stolen from the homes, as well.

Although a passer-by noticed Jan. 8 the
backdoor of Robertson’s house had been kicked
in, the robberies could have occurred any time
over the break. Howie said since the students
were away for several weeks, it was difficult to
determine when the burglaries took place.

When asked if there had been other break-ins
in the Armour Street area, Howie replied, “Ican’t
think of anything recent, but I think [Armour
Street] kind of is aconcern to us. I guess just the
fact that you’ ve got students, and I’ m not saying
it’s just students, coming and going with breaks
and what not makes them a prime target.”

Howie also mentioned that the Police Depart-
ment planned to monitor Armour Street more
strictly when students leave on future vacations.

He said, “Armour would be a good place for
us to do [patrols] on a regular basis when stu-
dents are on a break. It would be good on our
part to take the ball and run with it.”

Fountain Walker, Director of Public Safety,
said students informed him on Jan. 12 and 13
that DVDs, CDs and other items had been stolen
from their apartments.

Since there was no sign that any of the apart-

ments had been forced open, Walker and his
staff have focused their investigation on de-
termining who might have had key or Cat Card
access to the residences.

Walker explained, “The officers here have
interviewed staff from different departments
that may have gone [into the apartments].
We’ ve interviewed the contractors that were
on campus at the time, and I’m pretty sure I
have a good account and an idea of who may
have keys and may have card access.”

While Walker noted he had no leads, he
expressed some confidence he had been able
to narrow down the pool of suspects.

“T guess I feel comfortable in saying that I
don’t feel like [the robber] was a student on
break or anything like that, nor do I feel like
it was a staff member.”

The robberies took place in Hart and F.

Howie said students who planned to be
away from their off-campus homes for an
extended period of time could request the
Police Department set up a zone check for
their residence.

When citizens request a zone check, “We
come out [four times a day], check the resi-
dence, and make sure no windows or doors
are standing open,” explained Howie.

Walker agreed with Howie’s assessment,
saying, “I would definitely put the house on
zone check because the departments have to
check them at least [twice a day]. In my po-
licing career, there’s only been one or two
situations wherea house was actually broken
into and it was on our zone check list. Not
saying that it can’t happen, but it’s a rarity.”

Walker also mentioned students should

As students return to Davidson for the spring
semester, the Residence Life Office is chal-
lenged to accommodate an unusually large
number of students.

The housing situation has been further
strained by the return of many juniors from
abroad. The shortage of space has forced some

Johnson-Bean ’06 said, “Not having a lounge
has made the hall far less social, because there
is adefinite amount of community building that
occurs within a hall lounge.”

Sophomore Jordyn Griffin echoed a similar
sentiment. “I love the girls living in the room,
and it is nice to have them on the hall, but it is
hard not having a lounge because you lose the
quiet place to study or watch TV.”

Further housing complications have arisen
from students who had planned to go abroad in
the spring and changed their plans last minute
as well as from students who had expressed
interest in living off-campus but were unable
to find housing.

In accordance with Davidson’s guaranteed
housing policy, the Residence Life Office has
tried hard to accommodate the overflow of stu-
dents. .

Nine student lounges in various dorm build-
ings up the hill have been converted into dor-
mitory rooms. While this has provided extra
space, many students feel that not having a
lounge detracts from the social life of the hall.
