Hamm(er)ing it up at Davidson: RSC set design

By Ty WHITE
Staff Writer

Imagine bringing your wildest dreams to
life on stage, with one constraint: you
have to share the stage on a daily basis
with another person’s wildest dreams.

Fiona Buffini, director of the Royal
Shakespeare Company’s current touring
production of “The Two Gentlemen of
Verona,” acknowledged that the first
thing she considered in designing a set
was that her production would be shar-
ing a stage with David Farr’s “Julius
Caesar.”

“We knew we would be sharing the
stage from the word go,” Buffini said at
a Theatre Department workshop earlier
this month.

What this sharing entails is the direc-
tors working together to choose an
acceptable color and medium for the
floor, then creating easily-constructed
and deconstructed sets for their own pro-
ductions.

In this case, everything came together
flawlessly. The two directors agreed to a
polished concrete floor, then created the
rest of the set around it. The second dif-
ficulty came when they discovered that
not all of their productions on tour (their
Davidson College stop, specifically) utilized
the thrust stage they were used to, where the
audience is seated on three sides of the
actors.

Without being able to see the productions
on a thrust stage, one would have thought

"that the productions were designed specifi-
cally for a proscenium theatre-like the Duke
Family Performance Hall.

The sets themselves were things of beau-

ty. While both were relatively simple, with
straight lines and only minor changes
between scenes, both were used effectively
to bring the audience into the world of the
play.

The set for “The Two Gentlemen of

*“‘Caesar”’ characters too unstable

By DaviD KERNS
Staff Writer

As the lights go down, there is barely time
to get to your seats before the stage erupts
with action. Immediately, we are transported
to a strange revolutionary world: cold, dark,
and foreboding, made up of a motley group
of ruffians ruled under a single iron fist, in a
quasi-Cold War environment.

This progressive interpretation of
Shakespeare’s “Julius
Caesar” cast off the
robes of the tradition-
al Roman setting and
instead adopted a
modern alternative
dress and environ-
ment. Although this
version is visually
stimulating and offers
new insights into the
meaning of the dia-
logue, some of the
power of the original text lost its strength
with such a progressive adaptation.

As we meet the principal characters, we
find out the makeup of the balance of power
within this empirical regime: Caesar has dic-
tatorial rule over the land, while Brutus’ and
Cassius’ envy of Caesar’s power continu-
ously grows.

Throughout the play, the audience views a
full spectrum of emotion, namely from
Brutus and Caesar. In any given scene, both
might be at the verge of tears one minute,
close to fighting the following minute, and
completely content the next.

I felt that although this heightened the
emotional experience of the play, it was
somewhat inappropriate considering the
nature of these characters. These are men of
position and power; they make daily deci-
sions that decide the future of entire nations,
and yet they may welcome tears at the drop
of a hat? When I first read the play, I felt that
these characters have to be much stronger

and stolid than normal men. It is only
through this heightened strength that Brutus
is able to boldly kill his beloved mentor and
honorably take his own life when circum-
stances call for him to do so.

This interpretation also has a heightened
sense of conspiracy and corruption. It
seemed to me that, even though this went
along with the neo-Cold War atmosphere, it
subtracted from the sense of honor that was
so integral in the original text.

Even Mark
Antony, after giving
his passionate and
memorable~ eulogy
over Caesar’s body,
seems to rescind on
his allegiance to his
dead friend, lowing
his tone, shredding
Caesar’s will, and
taking immediate
control of the army.

In the traditional
version of the play, Mark Antony would
never conspire against Caesar: Caesar was
like a father to Mark Antony, and the sole
motivation for a war against Brutus and
Cassius is to seek justice for Caesar’s brutal
murder.

Similarly, Brutus’ betrayal of Caesar was
downplayed because the intensity of their

initial relationship was never established at _

the outset of the play. Traditionally, this is a
play about power, honor, loyalty, and betray-
al, but some of these themes didn’t receive
as much attention within this adaptation.

All and all, it was a good play filled with
interesting character and setting decisions.
The company used intense lighting, staging,
and camera techniques to dramatize the
more biting scenes of the play.

The ending, possibly my favorite scene,
reinforced the dictatorial theme: in almost an
Animal Farm-type manner, they depicted the
formation of a new regime, no different from¢
Caesar’s absolute rule.

Verona” featured three vertical panels in the
back of the set which opened and closed as
the scene dictated. When open, the scene
was often that of a party in the Duke of

Milan’s palace. The tops of the panels were
illuminated to give the effect of candelabras
as the guests streamed in and out or danced
the Lindy Hop. Another’back panel opened
late in the play as Sylvia was locked in a
tower by her father. The versatility of the set

combined with the costumes allowed Fiona
Buffini to give the audience the true feel of
being in the 1920s.

Far from the glamour of the 1920s stands
the industrial set of “Julius
Caesar.” As swords turn to

 semi-automatics, so too is
ancient Rome turned to the
late twentieth century. The set
itself consists of an industrial
jungle-gym, upon which are
hung banners and sheets to
transform the stage between
scenes.

The production relies heavi-

ly on multimedia and techni-
cal effects and is not afraid to
show it. In a Brechtian move
to make the audience aware
that they are watching a play,
not real life, the soundboard is
clearly visible to the audience
through the jungle-gym, and
' the actors double as stage-
» hands, providing hand-held
s lighting for nearly half the
scenes. If not done carefully,
exposing so much of the tech-
nical aspects of the production
could detract from the acting.
Yet Farr successfully used the
exposure to his advantage.

Farr challenges the audience to see more
in the play than the simple formula of a
Shakespearean tragedy. He lets them see
through the props and scenery and theatrical-
ity to the exposed souls of the characters.
