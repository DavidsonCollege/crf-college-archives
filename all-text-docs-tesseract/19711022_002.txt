ly oriented national association

though the association offers
services. including an informa-
tion center and the opportunity
for contact with other student
leaders. wmch could prove very

valuable to its members?

Soon after its split with the
CIA. the NSA found itscif in
debt to the tune of $500.000. This
was due almost entirely to poor
Tranagement. but since that
time the association has been
steadily alleviating this debt,
and at present is $60,009 in the

The association now funds it
self primarily through personal
donations. but does aceept a
hmited amount of federal
monev for specific projects.

Under NSA by-laws member
schools are not liable for pay-
ment of any debts of the asso-
ciation.

According to Student Body
President Danny  Clodfelter,
cffiliation with NSA. while not
mandatory for efficient  stu-
dent government. does have its
advantages.

He felt that inasmuch as the

right to affiliate the student

Morey also added that the
services offered by NSA were

He cited as an example the
