Urban Bush Women electri

By Laura Liebfreid

Did you ever think you’d be
sitting on the edge of your seat,
swaying to the beat of the conga
drum, utterly enraptured by the
movement of eight African
American dancers, and wishing it
would never end? Neither did I,
until witnessing the Urban Bush
Women this past Tuesday night.

Urban Bush Women was
founded by Artistic Director
Jawole Willa Jo Zollar in 1984.
Based in New York City, her
company includes a worldly mix
of dancers, from as far as
Jamaica to as close as Virginia.
While the company focuses
primarily on movement, their
incorporation of drama, live
music, and speech adds a unique
flavor that is readily welcomed
by audiences of all walks of life.

“Part of our mission is to
perform in all different types of
places,” Zollar says. “We are
happy to share in the Davidson
experience tonight.”

The program began with a

piece called “A Dance... Batty
Moves.” “Batty,” we are told, is
Jamaican slang for “butt.” A
single dancer dominated the
Stage. Her lush, spontaneous
movement responded to the beat
- of the drums as though she were
‘conversing with them. Clad in
earthy, loose-fitting garments,
her bare feet reached out as if to
touch the sky, only to fall back to
the earth again in a sweeping,
caressing flare. As the music
gradually climaxed into an
explosion of sound, voices were

heard singing in the distance, and
her movements became spas-

modic, almost tribal.

The next work, “Girl-
friends,” was lighter with more
of a theatrical base. Four
dancers, each dressed in what
appeared to be pajamas, pre-
sented a “day in the life” glance
at contemporary African-
American culture. In all appear-
ances it was a slumber party that
represented the harmony of
sisterhood. What made the piece
unique was the fact that there
was no music save the sounds the
dancers made with their hands
and feet. Slapping, pushing,
shoving, stomping, running, and
rolling, they created rhythm
within their actions. The
intensity of the dancers made it
scarcely believable that they
were pantomiming, until
suddenly, peals of real laughter

many people dissatisfied. What
pushed Tilden over the edge of
insanity? Something that
happened in New Mexico.
That’s all we know, and if we
hope to find out by the end,
we’re out of luck. We feel the
same confusion and impotence
that Tilden does because by not
knowing we experience the same
emotions as he.

If you left the theater
scratching your head, Tilden
probably got to you. And if you

- hit Backstreet for a smoke and a
couple of shots of whiskey to try
and forget the whole thing, you
probably identified with Dodge
(i.e. dodging the issue). At first,
the audience identifies closely
with Shelley (Ashley Wright)
and Vince (Derek Judson) who
share our confusion, walking into
a house where no rules apply, but
by the end, we don't know whom

Robert Altman, Short Cuts. A
worthy field to be sure, but this
will go down in history as the
Spielster, so look for him to pick
up the trophy in this category.
Spielberg recently picked up the
top honor from the Director’s Guild
of America which virtually assures
him of an Academy Award. Only
three times in the past sixty years
has the winner of the DGA award
not gone on to win the Oscar as
well, and ironically Spielberg was
one of these exceptions when he
won the DGA for The Color Purple
in 1986 but did not pick up an
Oscar - such a great snub that I
won’t even grace my article with
the name of the director and film
that won instead.

Oscar won’t make the same
mistake twice.

. Best Picture: The Fugitive,
In the Name of the Father, The
Piano, The Remains of the Day,
and Schindler’s List. It is a long-
‘standing rule that the director who
wins Best Director has his film win
Best Picture. Spielberg will be
back at the podium accepting the
Best Picture award.

to trust.

True, Shepard’s bizarre style
may distract audiences from
catching on to what he is trying
to accomplish, but at the same
time, the alienation we feel by
being struck with a completely
different set of conventions is a
part of the art. As every charac-
ter in the play has adifferent 4:
view of reality, of what really
happened to Tilden and the child,
so does every member of the
audience. Though we under-

stand the whole picture, we must
remind ourselves that we each
create our own realities from our
own perspectives. The actors, no
doubt, were also unsure about
what really happens in the play,
but they succeeded at creating a
reality for each individual
character and making the play
work as a whole. It is up to us to
decide who is right or good.
Buried Child may mystify us, but
we cannot give up on meeting
Shepard’s challenge.
