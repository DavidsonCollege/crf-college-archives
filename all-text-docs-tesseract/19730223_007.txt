He explained that some 60
schools trom aeross the country
were invited to send only one

scheduled to be represented by
the varsity team ot Eskridge
and Paul Mitchell

“There are one or two more
tournaments coming up.
E'skridge continued. “the South
Atlantic Forensic Tournament
al Lenior- Rhyne College next
weekend and a tournament at
the “American University in
Washington at the end of Mar-
ch ”’

The team has received in-
vitations to atlend several other
tournaments in the spring but
has not vet decided which ones
to accept. he said.

Eskridge was pleased with
the team’s record so far this
year. ‘This varisty 1s 18-lu. or
64 percent won-lost. and the
novice teams are 49-31. or 61
percent.

"This is just a little below last
year’s record. but I'd attribute
that to the fact that we haven't
entered as many tournaments.

They are usually dirty and are
worn out. but worst of all are
the bugs in them

I was on one of those old buses
one dav In front of me an old
man was dozing peacefully on
the striped seat As the bus went
along the old man started to
scratch his hip At first. he was
half asleep and scratched gen-
thy and unconsciously But soon
he started to scratch his back
and legs as well Something

must have been itching him. for
now he was wide awake and
scratching frantically.
