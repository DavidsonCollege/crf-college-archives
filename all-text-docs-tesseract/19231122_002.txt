In a fast and furious game, ‘the Juniors |
defeated the Fresh by the score of 27 to 14, |
From the outset there was no doubt as to the |
out come, the Juniors having everything their
own way. Probably one reason for the poor |
showing of the Fresh was that their coach
had left the hill and there was no one to
guide their destinations. There were a good

Yard Lines

By W. F. Galloway
A great game, team. We are proud of you.

The Wildcats out fought Carolina, out-
gained Carolina, out-passed Carolina and out-
punted Carolina, but the Tarheels outscored
Davidson.

Third verse. Same song.
Hard luck once more,

The Raleigh News and Observer remarks
that “the Wildcats showed more kinds of
football than Carolina had ever heard of.”

We're going down right away to take down
Jimmy Hendrix’s tablet in the hard luck
ward, Jimmy played the game of his life
Saturday.

Carolint’s great passing system seem to
have passed out. The Tarheels didn’t work

ja pass Saturday. i

A broken leg on the kick-off was enough
to demoralize any team, but it made the
Wildcats dig in and fight all the hardet.

Carolina gave a yell for the Wildcats when

Popsy” footed the old ball for those three
points. Can the Tarheels beat the Wildcats
when it comes to courtesy ?

Three points can look like a million some-
times.

A good title for the game Saturday would
be “Luck and Pluck.” Sounds just like Hor-
atio Alger.

Of course the Wildcats didn’t have the
luck.

The Wildcats made Carolina’s “Big Team”
look mighty little at times.

We imagine there are 2000 Carolina stu-
dents right now wondering what Davidson
would have done if all the Cats were in con-
dition. We sometimes wonder a little our-
selves.

We had a little argument with a neighbor
at the Press Convention banquet last week.

Wildcats Meet Trinity
Eleven on Wearn Field

Students Will Go to Charlotte—An-
nual Turkey Day Mix-up
Closes Season

On Thanksgiving day Trinity will draw
up her minions on Wearns Field in Charlotte
for the annual Turkay Day mixup. The
Davidson Wildcats will be on hand also. with
claws sharpened for the rest of superiority.
The dope box. looks about equal though
there is a possible margin in Trinity's favor
account the percentage of
games in’ the state.

Trinity opened the season like a regular
scoring machine. Guilford and Randolph-
Macon went down in rapid succession, 67-0

on of smaller

and 54-0, before the onstlaught of the Metho- |

dists.. Trinity stock soared high, But she
came to blows with the Tar Heels the next
week and emerged with the scars of battle
but not of victory. Carolina won 12-6 and
Methodist stock was par again.

Trinity lost the next two games to two
heavy Vitgintatcams, William and Mary de-
feated her 21-0, and Virginia 33-0. She
came back in the next game with a 39-0 vic-
tory over Elon and then dropped the next to
Wake Forest 6-16. Then Elon came back
and for the first half of the game with
Wake Forest it seemed that Trinity would
still Bave a chance at second honors. But
xBaptist touchdown and a field goal crushed
their hope and Wake Forest defeated Elon
by the narrow margin of 9-6.

On the other hand the Wildcats, while they
have suffered quite a few setbacks, have lost
to no team that Trinity has defeated.
lina defeated Davidson 14-3 and Trinity 14-6,
Wake Forest won from Davidson 7-0 and
from Trinity 16-6. So against these two
teams Davidson and Trinity are even by com-
parative score. In the clashes of the two
teams with Elon, Trinity came out in the
lead by 20 points. But Davidson played Elon
as a tryout game at the first of the season,
while Trinity was at the top of her mid-
season form when she walloped the Chris-
tians.

The odds are even. The stake is victory
in the last game of the season. Methodist
against Presbyterian, who has the better
team ?

After we had told him how much (?) we
thought of Trinity's chances of beating the
Wildcats we found out that he was the
Trinity Captain.

Trinity is planning to come to Charlotte
in full force and the strange thipg about it
is that some gf them think they are going
to win.

We had a card from Franklin Fricker, the
ex-Wildeat track stud. Franklin said it
was all bull about the private trainer. He
must have forgotten that this column used
to be “Bills Bull.”

That reminds us that Fricker has beaten
Harvard and Princeton since we last went to
press.

McBryde dropped over to the room the
other day to bull about the time he ‘used to
run Fricker ragged. You wouldn't think it
now to look at “Mac.”

Georgia vanishes from the list of unde-
feated Southern teams by a rising vote, 35-7.

Tech looks pretty sick after her third tied
game, and Florida isn't playing representa-
tive teams.

Alabama, Vandy and Center form the big
three to date, with Alabama perhaps the
weaker of the three.

The championship in some of the nearby
states are lining up as follows:

North Carolina—U. N. C.

South Carolina—Furman and Clemson.

Virginia—V. M. I. and W. & L.

Georgia—Georgia and Ga. Tech.

Florida—University of Florida.

Alabama—University of Alabama.

Tennessee—Vandy. ‘

Old “Bill” Harvard turned over in his
grave again when Brown porked the Crimson.

The season has been an uneasy one for the
old boy.

Caro- |

We found out one interesting thing at the
Press Convention, i. e., that in polite circles
this sort of bull is called “paragraphics.”
Which all goes to show that you don’t have
to know what yougare doing to get by with
it. Fei!

The individual gains on the Chapel Hill
| fracas show:
| Wells, 77; Hendrix, 52; Black, 42; Buck,
33; Sappenfield, 23; Hunt, 18; Davis, 10;
| Covington, 6.

We'll hand it to the Carolinians. They
play a teal sportsman’s game. Their spirit
jis good. Their treatment of a visiting team
is gooder. Their regard for the Wildcats is
gooderest.

Saturday will see some of the big teams
resting for the Thanksgiving Day classics
| but some of them will be plugging away: :

At Montgomery, Ala—Alabama 7, Geor-
gia 0,

At Louisville, Ky.—-Center 24, W. & L. 3.

At Jacksonville, 14, Miss.
A. & M. 7.

At Raleigh, N. C.—Wake Forest 7, N. C.
State 7.

At Greenville, S. C.-—Furman 34, Erskine

Fla.—Florida

0.
At Durham, N. C.—Trinity 20, Newberry
6.

IN FAVOR
THIS FALL

Short, threebutton,
half-belted, ulsters
are to be greatly
favored this fall.
You’ll see many
of them; but none
like the Society
Brand Hampton.

The difference is in
the cut. There’s an air
about this overcoat that
you will find nowhere
else; it’s smartly cut;
every detail—the roll of
the lapel, the spacing of

‘ the buttons, theplacing
of the pockets-is exactly
right.
