U.S. runs by Germany

Chastain leads team to 5th shutout
and potential historic season

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor —

International women’s soccer
invaded Richardson field on Sat-
urday, and despite the sloppy
weather the 3,459 fans in atten-
dance were treated to a magnifi-
cent 2-0 USA win over rival Ger-
many. :

“We’ re faster than the US has
ever been,” coach Tony DiCicco
said. “This is potentially the best
women’s team in history. We’re a
wonderful attacking team. Every
player on the field can score. That’s
an awesome thing, and an awe-
some task for the other team to deal
with.” ee

The attacking attitude of the
US team was evinced in the 17th
minute when defender and game
MVP Brandi Chastain collected a
ball the German defense had
cleared, found a seam, beat a de-
fender, and snuck a pass between
German goal-keeper Katja Kraus
and sweeper Doris Fitschen for a
charging Tiffeny Millbrett who
poked the ball into the empty net.

However, it is no accident that
Chastain posesses such offensive
skills. She was an All-American
forward at Santa Clara in 1990,
anda forward for the national team
from 1991-93, but she left the team
for personal reasons in 1993. She
rejoined the squad last September,
and moved to defender three
months ago.

“T thought I had something to
give at forward, but we have so
many (forwards). [thought might

be able to help in other spots. Tony
(DiCicco) asked me to play in the
back, and that was fine,” Chastain
said.

DiCicco cited Chastain as a
strength for the national team say-
ing*he decided soon after her re-
turn that she needed to be on the
field somewhere.

“We are still teaching her how
to be a defender, but we didn’t

expect her to play defense as well ©

as she has,” DiCicco said.

Chastain says the fact that she
used to be a forward has really
helped her in defending because
she has tried to use the same tricks
that forwards now try to use on her.

“Individual defending is prob-
‘ably the most difficult for me. In
front you are always a man down,
and always trying tointercept balls,
but you’re not in a one on one
situation much,” she said, ““That’s
where I have to do the most im-
proving.”

Kristine Lilly put the game
away by running past the German
defense to collect a looping pass
from Carin Gabarra and knock it
over a charging Kraus in the 89th
minute.

The victory was the fourth
straight shutout’ for the US and
goalie Briana Scurry’s second this
year.

Unfortunately for the US, star
forward Mia Hamm went down in
the 70th minute with a right knee
sprain.

DiCicco said Hamm would be
out for a few weeks, but according
to joking Milbrett, Hamm said she
would be ready to go next week.

Despite the injury to Hamm,
the team continues to prepare for
the Olympics this summer in At-
lanta, in an effort to improve on
their third place finish in the
Women’s World Championships
last year.

“The biggest thing about play-
ing in the Olympics here is it’s a
chance for the gold, and that’s
everybody’s dream,” Milbrett said.

According to DiCicco, the
team was using the two games
with Germany (the women de-
feated the German team 6-0 in
Atlanta on Thursday) as a barom-
eter, since Germany is widely con-
sidered to be one of the four best
teams in the world, along with
China and Norway.

While there are still areas in
which DiCicco wants to see im-

_provement, namely defense and

ball control, things look promising
as they push towards the summer.

I thought my Dad had been collecting U.S. Savings Bonds.
Then I realized that he wasn’t just “collecting” but “saving” to help _
insure our future. Savings Bonds are backed by the full faith and

credit of the United States, so they're secure. They eam interest for
up to 30 years. And their value is guaranteed to grow at market-
based rates. That's insuring the future.

Ask your employer or banker about saving with
U.S. Savings Bonds. For all the right reasons.

killers
nearly
make his-
tory in
NCAA’s

By MICHAEL KRuSE:
Assistant Sports Editor

After Western Carolina up-
set Davidson two weeks ago in|
Greensboro, the Catamounts and
their mentor Phil Hopkins were
obviously jovial and legitimatley
funny.

With a little help from the
Coliseum PA guy, the beaming
coach had proposed to his fian-
cee during the trophy presenta-
tion. She had said yes.

Asked if he had been more
nervous when Davidson made
its second half run or when he
popped the question, Hopkins
replied, “I’ve been married be-
fore, but I had never won the
Southern Conference.”

The media laughed.

But 16th-seeded Western
was no joke Thursday night when
it nearly pulled off the greatest
upset in NCAA Tournamenthis-
tory, succumbing to top-seeded
Purdue, 73-71, when Joel
Fleming’ s potentially game-win-
ning bomb and Joe Stafford’s
runner in the lane misfired in the
final five seconds.

At the press conference fol-
lowing the near-miss, Hopkins,
so happy-go-lucky two weeks
before, cried. ° ~

Euphoria. Dejection. These}.
two opposing emotions come to-
gether in unprecedented fashion
throughout college basketball’s
March showcase.

The Ivy League produces
doctors and lawyers, not NBA
All-Stars. But on Thursday night,
Princeton dethroned defending
champion UCLA, 43-41, in a
deliberate game of old-fashioned
basketball fundamentals: that
would have made James
Naismith proud.

Princeton scored 17 baskets
on 15 assists. The game-win-
ning play, a backdoor layup with
three ticks left, was perfectly
executed.

The game extended coach
Pete Carril’s career. After hav-
ing guided his Tigers to an emo-
tional overtime victory against
Penn in the Ivy playoff days ear-
lier, the 30-year instructor an-
nounced his retirement. He did
so by writing on the lockerroom
blackboard, “I’m retiring. I’m
very happy.”

’ The classy coach cited the
victory as his career highlight.
Andhe had plenty from which to
choose.

Saturday afternoon, the Mis-
sissippi State Bulldogs sent
Princeton and Carril home.

During a CBS post-game

interview, Carril broke down.
