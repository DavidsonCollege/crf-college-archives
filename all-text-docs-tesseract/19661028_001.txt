To Attract

The need for new members
in an expanded cultura) ex-
change will be the topic at the
Project of the Americas mem-
bership program at 9 Thurs-
day night in the Green Room of
the College Union.

Open to all students, the pro-
gram will “emphasize how the
the expanded exchange will
enable increased student parti-
cipation in helping better rela-
tions between the Americas,”
according to PRAM Secretary
Bill Wiliams.

Featured in the program will
be a discussion and slides on
the past achievements of PRAM|
and plans for future expansion. |

Dr. Phi.p Secor, assistant
professor of political science and
faculty advisof to PRAM, will
also discuss the significance of
the project in the two years
since it was first begun on the
Davidson campus.

Last year PRAM carried out
an exchange program in which
15 U. S. students went to Ecua-
dor and Bolivia and eight Ecua-
dorians returned to the U. S.,
each for two months.

This year there are plans to
extend the program to -Mexico
and Peru, increase the number
of participating U. S. colleges
and universities from 15 to 40,
up PRAM chapters on these
campuses and begin plans for
next summer when each of the

chapters will sponsor exchanges.

Other plans include the estab-
lishment of PRAM _ sponsored

speaking tours. scholarships for ;

study at foreign universities and

cultural exchanges such as that :°

of folk groups.

Trustees Finish
Autumn Meeling

The college trustees wound up
their fall meeting today.

Much of the meeting was ex-

The only cloud on the horizon
is for some seniors who will be

“This is the best entertainment
we've ever had at Davidson and
probably the best for years to
come," Vince Foster. Social
Council Chairman, commented.

Over 3,000 students and alum-
ni are expected at the Home-
coming luncheon to be held on
the lawn in front of the Union
from 12 until 2 p.m. Saturday.

period at the May meeting.

Another special feature will be
the fortieth reunion of the 1926
state champion Wildcat football
team.

Students’ identification cards
will be checked by policemen at
both concerts, Foster said. He
reported that tickets to the
Righteous Brothers concert are
selling well on campus but sales
are slow outside the campus.

Extra Hours Charge
Will Not Be Dropped

Little chance exists for revis-
ing the practice of charging an
additional $15 per semester hour
for all hours over 16.

“It’s just like buying a suit of
clothes," said Myron McGill,
Bursar of the college. “If you
buy a tie, it costs extra. There
has to be a limit somewhere or
else things get out of balance."’

The need and justice of this
system has been questioned by
Julian Prosser, junior Student
Council member, who has circu-
lated petitions opposed to the
practice. Prosser finds three
main fallacies in the system.

The first is that ‘‘since fresh-
men are allowed to take only 13
or 14 hours, they should be al-
lowed to thake these additional
hours up later at no additional
cost.

“Furthermore, since the De-
partment of the Army finances
the entire ROTC program, the
third and fourth years of ROTC
should not be included in the 16
hour Hmit.”

Finally, “since Davidson seeks
to produce the well-rounded
student, it is somewhat out of
character with this spirit to set
a limit for the number of courses
‘a student may take without be-
ing penalized."

Currie stated that it was much
fairer to charge only the 140
students taking over the limit
than to charge the entire student
body.

Prosser expects to have over
500 signatures on his petitions
which urge that a student be al-
lowed to take as many hours as
he wishes.

Great Issues Speaker
Proclaims ‘New Left’

“For many years the word
‘left’ was a bad word in this
country, even before McCar-
thy,” began Dr. Daniel Berman
in a chapel speech Monday on
the revitalized role of the “New
Left’ in the U. S.

A professor of political science
at American University, Ber-
man came Davidson as the first
of the YMCA Great Issues
speakers on the topic of *‘The
Social Revolution in the U. S."

Berman contributed the de-
cline of socialism in the U. S.
early in the century to com-
munist scares in the country,
beginning with the Russian Re.
volution and continuing through
the New Deal and World War
II,

“The result." Berman con.
tinued, ‘‘was that the socialistic
spirit on campuses was killed.”
People became contented with
the status quo.

The fire of the New Left be-
gan in the late ‘50's with the
civil rights movement and has
been fanned by the growing
displeasure with American pol.
iey.

The civil rights conflict ac-
quainted people ‘‘with new chan-
nels of unconventional political
action.” It was this point that
Berman believed to have en-
chanted college students, be-
cause in its wake came the in-
terest revival on the nation’s
campuses.

The “Freedom Now" slogan
of the civil rights movement
will, according to Berman, be
a living issue until ‘‘the second
class citizenship ends.”

And the movement will be-
come more and more radical.
“The same whites.” he said,
“who look back to the good old
days of Martin Luther King’s
leadership did not support him
when he was the leader.” The.

The recent upheaval of pro-
test against the administra.
tion’s foreign policy is also a
matter of concern of the New
Left. ‘“‘The American people.”
he pointed out, ‘‘gave Johnson
a mandate to move on a foreign
policy that would be an anti-
thesis to Goldwater's."

When Johnson switched his
stand, however and embarked
on a course similar to that of
Goldwater, the ‘‘American poli-
tical process failed because the

“Everyone gave generously:
the drive was very successful.”

Such were the feelings of
Scott Gabrielson. president of
Sigma Phi Epsilon, in discussing
the United Fund Appeal Drive
which the SPE’s conducted on
campus last week.

In the week of solicitation and
collecting. slightly over $3300
was raised. This total added to
the community total, gave the
entire Davidson area 200 per
cent of its anticipated goal.

According to Gabrielson, the
average contribution was $5-
$6. He named fourth floor Can-
non the outstanding hall con-
tributor, with 28 people giving
a total of $275.

The sum total would have
been. even higher, Gabrielson
said, if everyone had been con-
tacted. Because of the time of
collection, many were not con.
tacted at all. It was also pointed
out that some. students had con-
tributed to the United Fund last
summer through their summer
eniployer.

voters had been ill-represented.”’

The New Left then de-
mands unconditional withdrawal
of troops from Viet Nam.
“Negotiation is not acceptable.”

The notion that we are al-
ways right, said Berman, is a
common fallacy .in American
thought: ‘Many peoples will not
accept our method of self deter-
mination,”

“It is the belief.” he went on,
“of the New Left that our inter-
vention in civil wars will do
more harm -than the civil wars
themselves.’”

The cause of the trouble, Ber-
man asserted, is that the Presi-
den has let his ego get out of
proportion. ‘‘He has become in-
flexible."

Berman's New Left is already
firmly entrenched with plans
for a long range policy after an
initial doctrinaire position. It is
“gravitated toward pragmatic
socialism and not Marxism"
with “policies made for the
benefit of society, not for the
maximizing of profit.”

men honorary fraternity, the

Election to Phi Beta Kappa,
the oldest of the American
Greek letter societies. is gen-
erally considered the highest re-
cognition of scholastic achieve-
ment.

Three Members Added

To Faculty

The selection of the faculty
committee which will draw up
a faculty constitution and re-
vise the by-laws has now been
completed.

Chosen by President D. Grier
Martin are German Instructor
Hansford Epes, History Profes-
sor J. A. McGeachy and Bible
Professor Daniel Rhodes.

They join Assistant Philoso.
phy Professor A. B. Brinkley.
Philosophy Professor George
Aberngshy, Assistant Economics
Professor Louise Nelson and As-
sistant History Professor W.
Brown Patterson, who have been
elected by the faculty.

Faculty procedure has not
been changed in many years.

Committee

The self-study report and the en-
largement of the faculty indicat-
ed that change was needed.

Matters to be changed will
probably include the order of
business, re-evaluation of com.
mittees and a revamping of the
operational structure.

The faculty expects these
changes to provide better co-or-
dination among the faculty, faci-
litate business procedure and
make the faculty position on
campus issues clearer.

The recommendations of this
committee are tentatively sched-
uled to be approved by the
Trustees in May so that the new
constitution and by-laws can go
into effect for the year 1967-68.
