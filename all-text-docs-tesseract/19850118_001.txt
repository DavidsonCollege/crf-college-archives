Incident Stirs Concern About Rapes On Campus

Many Rapes Are Not Reported;
RAPE Seeks To Raise Awareness

By DAVID VAN PELT
Last week’s alleged rape drew atten-
tion to a growing concern among David-
son administration and campus groups
about the frequency of such incidents on

campus and_ the

A measures needed to
prevent them.

News “Many women

Analysis _ refuse to believe it

can happen at
Davidson,” said Anne Miano, a member
of the new Raised Awareness and Protec-
tion for Everyone (RAPE) Committee
formed to counsel victims and educate
the Davidson community about rape.
“There is a feeling that if you recognize
what is going on, you destroy what is un-
iquely Davidson,” Miano said. Last
week’s incident marks only the second
rape on record at Davidson, she said, but
many more go unreported. “We don’t
have anything to point out to show

people its been going on because it hasn't
been resorted,” she said.

“It's very hard to shock people into
reality when you can’t show records and
say, ‘This is reality.” ” Despite the lack
of recorded incidents, Miano said she
feels that rape is not uncommon at
Davidson. “I think if you took a poll ask-
ing people, ‘Have you ever known some-
one ever raped on campus?’ you would
get an overwhelming yes, especially
among women.” Miano noted that most
rape cases at Davidson probably involve
acquaintance rape, which acounts for ap-
proximately 70 percent of all rapes.

Dean of Students Sue Rosss said
most conversations with students con-
cerning rape “go on in very general
terms. Maybe someone knows someone
who has been forced to have sex.” Ross
said college-age persons are particularly
vulnerable to confusion in sexual inten-

Town, County Police Take Evidence ;
Search For Suspect Continues

By ROSS HOLT

Town police and Mecklenburg
County police are pressing the search for
a man who allegedly raped a Davidson
student in her Little dormitory room last
Saturday.

Town police chief Jack Warlick,
whose officers became actively involved
in the investigation this week, said police
have several suspects in the case. But, he
said, no arrests appear imminent, be-
cause police have not questioned all the
suspects.

Warlick confirmed the existence of
physical evidence, which he said may
lead to an arrest.

The victim, a 20-year-old sopho-
more, reported the alleged rape Saturday
night. She told County police she awoke
between 3:30 and 6 a.m. Satuday morn-
ing as a man she could not identify raped
her.

She described her attacker as a 5°9”

‘No Hoopla,
No Respect’

Editors’ note: Senior Dwayne D.
Wright shares his thoughts on his four
years as a football player at Davidson.

By DWAYNE D. WRIGHT

Davidson is unlike any other
school that I have ever been associated
with. Where I come from, athletics,
especially football, are a source of
pride for the colleges and high schools.
Football players are respected. The
people enjoy football. Of course, these
people take their football seriously —
sometimes too seriously — but in
doing so, they make the game fun for
both the players and themselves.

Without the fans, the band, the
cheerleaders, and all the other hoopla
that surrounds a football game, the
event is more akin to a war than sport.
The fun comes in performing for a
crowd, in hearing the cheers, in hear-
ing the band play.

‘My experience with four years of
Davidson foot-
ball has been
that playing
football —_ here
just isn’t any
fun. There is no
hoopla and no
respect.

The hoopla

and respect give a player extra incen-
tive to perform well, and that extra
mental boost is essential for a team

such as Davidson’s which lacks the
size and talent of its opponents. The
lack of hoopla, though, does not
adequately explain the mediocrity of
Davidson football. To be successful,
Davidson will have to start recruiting
bigger and better players. The only
way to do this is to lower the admis-
sions standards and/or to offer full
scholarships.

The former is not likely to happen
— nor should it happen. The latter
must happen if the team is to be com-
petitive in a league (Southern Confer-
ence) in which the other schools offer
full scholarships.

For many players, Davidson ts a let

After all, college football is supposed
to be a step above high school. Here,
there is disappointment with the facil1-

port. Police also believe the suspect wore
a blue baseball cap with the letter “B” in
gold script on it, County Officer S. L.
Price said. Price filed the initial police re-
port, and is handling the investigation for
the County.

Price would neither confirm nor deny
reports that the alleged rapist was a stu-
dent. Dean of Students Will Terry said
the College is “involved with and
cooperating with the police.”

Warlick and Price both urged stu-
dents to contact police with any informa-
tion about the case, especially regarding
the baseball cap. Posters have appeared
in campus dorms which carry a descrip-
tion of the cap and give two numbers for
students to call County police.

OCRL To

Allow Court
Social Houses

By DAVID McGEE

The Council on Campus and Religi-
ous Life (CCRL) Monday voted 9-3 to
allow campus groups which would not
provide meals to operate houses on Pat-
terson Court. However, the CCRL did
not determine specific criteria such or-
ganizations must meet to run a Court
house.

At the meeting, the CCRL discussed
the general principles the Court abides
by, and it will consider the practical as-
pects of allowing social houses on the
Court at a meeting next Monday. Among
the principles discussed by the CCRL,
according to Patterson Court Council
President Murray Simpson, were
whether or not houses could stop serving
meals and remain on the Court, and the
priorities the CCRL would consider in al-
lotting Court houses to interested groups.

Presently, two Court houses are un-
occupied, Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
has asked the CCRL if it could move on
campus into one of the Court's unoc-
cupied houses and not serve meals. Most
SPE members eat at the Commons.

SPE proposed returning to the Court
after the Davidson Board of Adjustors
last May denied the fraternity special use
zoning of its house at 409 N. Main
Street.

At a PCC meeting yesterday, issues
associated with SPE’s proposal were dis-
cussed. Several members stated that SPE

would gain an unfair rush advantage by
