Hope For NDEA

The unanimous decision of a Con-
essional subcommittee last week to
lock President Johnson’s plans to de-
stroy the National Defense Education
Act student loan program is a boon to
the nation’s colleges’ attempts to pro-
vide funds for every student who may
need them.

In his budget for the coming fiscal
year, beginning July 1, the President
proposed to scrap the NDEA in favor
of a fanciful program of federally sub-
sidized, privately financed loans.

The nearly 100 Davidson students
who depend on the federal loans for

art of their expenses would be placed
In a precarious position in regard to

Soft Approach

Davidson’s Student Council
has often been accused of tak-
ing a lackadaisical approach to
things this year, but we're afraid
that the student government at
East Tennessee State University
has really shown their backside
in matters of student. concern.

The folks over in the hills of
Johnson City just don’t want to
put up with things that rub them
the wrong way. Instead of mess-
ing around, they seem to really
get down to the seat of things.

Earlier this month a bill was
introduced in the student senate
demanding that the school pro-
vide softer toilet paper.

The student Liaison Council
approved the bill and sent it
along to the business manager
of the school.

We don’t mean to wipe out the
Davidson council by any means,
but the folks at ETSU have cer-
tainly taken the cake-roll in this
one.

their financial plans for next year.

Since its beginning in 1958, the

program has been an important part
of the financial aid set-up at Davidson.
Over $200,000 has been appropriated
through the Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid during the past seven
years.
According to Director of Admis-
sions H. Edmunds White, the program
could become self-sustaining in a few
years, because money is now being re-
paid into the fund with the former
borrowers showing a relatively good
repayment record.

As it stands, the college may not
have the funds to carry out the pro-
gram, since the President did not re-
quest an extension of the program.

Under the President’s substitute
program, there would be no assurance
that the most needy students would
receive aid. Since more students may
be eligible in future vears, there would
be a chance of insufficient funds from
the new combination federal-private
outfit.

In drawing up the new budget, the
President must have decided to cut
back on some domestic outlays in light
of the bulging expense of the Viet-
namese war. So, he chose the elimina-
tion of NDEA, which would cut nearly
$180 million out of the budget for
next year. ; .

The President, then, is proposing
to junk a proven loan program and to
replace it with a flaunting scheme
which only spells disaster for many
low income students.

The program is not out of danger
yet; however, the unanimous approval
of the House Education subcommittee
to uphold the program foretells an
easier road ahead.’ ;

We hope that Congress sees fit to
further the present loan program and
that the President in the future will
keep his “politicking” hands out of the
field of education.

Dangers Of Sing Out

_ Davidson students have been de-
lightfully entertained recently bv the
representatives of “Sing Out ’66.”

We were captured by the group,
too, and emphatically endorse the vi-
brant aggregation—as long as they are
singing.

Thev are an exciting. colorful and
healthy bunch with a sincere desire to
better America.

The troupe has been a hit wherev-
er it goes. In Columbia, S. C., several
weeks ago, it filled the local auditori-
um to overflowing. In Charlotte last
week, more than 13.000 people—the
second largest crowd to pack the Coli-
seum—cheered the group into encore
after encore. ;

But disguised behind all the foot-
stomping and smiles of. these 150
young people is the dangerous phi-
losophy of Moral Re-Armament, Inc.
MRA is an ideology based on four
ideals: love, justice, unselfishness and
purity. But these tenets are merely
catchwords behind which hides the
Stealth of MRA.

Irony In Southeast

__ Ironic. While the U.S. spends bil-
lions of dollars and over 200,000 men
to hold up a smail toppling “domino”
on the Asian mainland, a much more
important nation falls—with no help
at all—for us. Indonesia, the world’s
fifth largest nation, has taken a quick
tumble in our direction—or at least
Sideways toward the Soviet Union.
All this with the U.S. State Depart-
ment, the New York Times, even the
Associated Press kicked out of the
country. No commitment, no contain-
ment, no green berets. Nothing.

It’s ironic also that, while the U.S.

The Deadly Cloak

Now is the season for symposiums,
forums and organized discussions on
current affairs on college campuses
across the country—except at David-
son.

We are somewhat embarrassed to
read of the ambitious and stimulating
programs which have been arranged
at various schools, while Davidson
seems to be content with discussing
her own particular issues of vespers,
fraternities and drinking.

Two years ago a YMCA sponsored
Great Issues program struggled to get
off the ground but failed to make any
headway. Yet, Davidson has never
hosted a concise, symposium-type pro-
gram which has been so successful
at other colleges recently.

Next month Virginia Tech, a scien-
tifically oriented school, is hosting a
svmposium on racial problems and the
Viet Nam war. Individuals taking part
in the VPI program are Roy Wilkins,
James Jackson Kilpatrick, Norman
Thomas and George Cabot Lodge.

was quoted in The New York World-
Telegram 30 years ago as advocating a
“God-controlled fascist dictatorship.”

As one critic of the program said:
“Have vou ever had anv cotton candv?
Well. that’s what Moral Re-Armament
is. Tastes good, but that’s all there is
to it.”

The young people undoubtedly
have a refreshing, positive outlook
which can do much to revitalize a be-
draggled portion of the population of
the world—the youth across the globe.

Victimizing their audience with
some reallv great. professional enter-
tainment, the members of “Sing Out
*$6” seek to sell individuals on some

ie-in-the-sky hopes and some cheap
iterature, which only adds to the
bulging pockets of their reactionary
leaders.

We wish the students well with
their top-notch entertainment. But we
caution their listeners to the ominous
machine that lies veiled behind the
excitement.

army which was commanded to “elim!-

munists after taking power this week.

with Barry Goldwater, Arthur Steiner
and John Seigenthaler included among
the participants to discuss ‘“‘America’s
New Global Challenge.”

Emory will soon be host to a con-
ference on conservatism.

Without de-emphasizing the prob-
lems which are Davidson's alone, we
believe that such symposiums would
definitely prevent the deadly cloak of
provincialism from dominating the in-
tellectual discussion here.

At times THE DAVIDSONIAN has
been accused of contributing to this
infamous cloak, and perhaps there is
some verity to this charge. Yet, we
are foremost a campus newspaper and
are bound to report and interpret the
issues and events here first of all.

We hope that some organization—
or even an ad hoc group with the spe-
cific aim of promoting a worthwhile
symposium at Davidson—will consider
seriously plans for such a program
here next year.

Seniors Assert Values
Of Anti-Vespers Protest

Dear Editor:

We are convinced that the ves-
per petition and boycott was, for
many reasons, of great and last-
ing value to the Davidson Col-
lege Community. The main pur-
pose of the boycott was to allow
students to express, in a definite
way, their opposition to a fea-
ture of Davidson life which they
have long complained about.

The intention was not to pres-
sure the powers-that-be into has-
ty action, but to demonstrate our
belief that change is needed.

Few Davidson students know
or even conceive of the power
which they may exert upon the
administration for a worthwhile
cause. This power, namely ac-

for a long time.

A mere handful of students be-
lieving sincerely in their cause,
brought action to the Davidson
campus by producing a special
meeting of the Religious Life
Committee, an Open End dis-
cussion with President Martin
devoted largely to the Vesper is-
sue, and an invitation to meet
with the Religious Life Commit-
tee.
At this meeting we presented
a petition signed by over 700 stu-
dents, calling for the abolition of
compulsory vespers. In addition,
we presented positive proposals
for a religious program based on
voluntary participation.

We believe that the best way

as possible, to make choices
rather than having these choices
made for him. We resent cer-
tain Davidson policies which
stem from the principle of ‘in
joco parentis.”

We believe that you can fill a
church pew but you cannot com-
pel worship. Furthermore, we
think that many prevalent anti-
religious attitudes among stu-
dents can be traced to the fac-
tor of compulsion.

A vigorous religious program
based on voluntary participation
is both more in keeping with
Christian principles and more
likely to effect individual Chris-
tian commitment than manda-
tory exercises.

He was, I always felt. a force
for moral good in the universe.
Those of us who were privileged
to know him admired the prob-
ity of his character, the breadth
of his compassion, the depth of
his intetlect. Generous almost to
a fault, his many acts of kind-
ness to America will never be
forgotten. It is a very great loss
indeed. He will be missed.”

From Basel, Switzerland, came
word that Dr. Karl Barth, ven-
erable Protestant theologian, in-
formed of the death of God, de-
clared: ‘I don’t know who died
in Atlanta, but whoever he was
he’s an impostor.”

Dr. Altizer, God's surgeon, in
an exclusive interview with The
Times, stated this morning that
the death was ‘‘not unexpected."

time,”’ Dr. Altizer said, ‘‘and
lived much longer than most of
us thought possible.” He noted
that the death of God. had, in
fact, been prematurely announc-

the last 10 years of his life, may
have confused ‘certain symp-
toms of morbidity in the aged
patient with actual death, a mis-
take any busy surgeon will occa-
sionally make.”

THE BOYCOTT THAT WASN’‘T
That intended boycott of compulsory Vespers

THE DAVIDSONIAN is published by the
students of Davidson College weekly during
the school year except examination periods
and holidays. Subscription rate: $4.00 per
year (if billed, $4.50). Payable to THE

last Sunday night was one of the most publicized
flops on campus this year. It was a farce from the
start. Even one of its avowed sponsors told me he
was going to morning services so that he wouldn’t
get a cut. He added: ‘We want ‘to emphasize our
protest as symbolic.”

Symbolic of what? As against required religious
services? Going to required morning services is a
protest? He could have done this kind of protest
every Sunday of the year.

Anyway, some 250 students were in Vespers
Sunday night, about normal attendance for this time
of year.

I note an attempt by Buzz Hardin and Calvin Zon
(on this page) to save a little face for the boycotters.
My suggestion to you, Buzz and Calvin and other
students, is this—assuming of course you are genu-
inely interested in preserving some kind of religious
emphasis at Davidson:

Form some kind of action group to stress your
own religious beliefs. Force the administration to
give you equal time for your own religious services.

eek out Presbyterians and others and challenge
their beliefs, in order to define your own.

In this way you show your own intrinsic belief
that religion is important enough to be worthy of an
intellectual ‘quest here at Davidson College.

But the only thing that interests most people
about.any curtailment of vespers is the possibility of
having one less exercise to attend.

THE RABBI CAME TO TEA

Rabbi Rubenstein came to town Monday and
freslogy. an interesting analysis of the God-Is-Dead

logy.

One problem he left untouched: If there is no
knowable moral order and all moral commitments
are equally valid, why should one choose a Sartrean
ethic (as did he) over any other ethic? How should
one choose between his ethic and say, that of the
Nazis? ;

Still this visiting fireman left some interesting
and unanswered questions to reflect upon. What dis-
tressed me was the sophomoric quality of most stu-
dent questioning. I fear this reveals a rather imma-
tare and underdeveloped intellectual group of stu-

HOW ABOUT THAT?

Davidson College now has 14 coaches on its ath-
letic staff—about one coach for every 70 students.
Lord love a duck, there is only one Bible prof for
every 140 students. Even the pre-med staff can’t
come close to the record of the athletic department.

Just goes to show that either we have one whale
of a phys. ed. major or at least most of students here
are on some intercollegiate team. What, we don’t
have either?

_ . Oh well, take heart. A couple more years of
siphoning funds from those earmarked for a new
library, new books and new educational equipment
should soon make quite a difference.

ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD

If the administration can stop adding more
coaches for a year or two, there is another crying
need for funds on this campus: new dorms to re-
place those dingy dungeons called Cannon, East and

You parents who read this column should have
a lot of sympathy for your boy if he rooms in one of
these dorms. In the spring and early fall he is roasted
alive. In the winter he is deafened by creaking steam
pipes and floors. Most of the furnishings were res-
cued from the Titanic and the lighting is equivalent
to that of any good basement sub-lease.
