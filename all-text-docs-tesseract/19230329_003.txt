THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 29, 1923.

DAVIDSONIA EUTOPIA
“Laundry called for and delivered.”
250 pretty co-eds.

Hot breakfasts delivered.
Absence restrictions suspended.
Classes as you like it.

Turkish baths aurn suite.

P. C. Henderson while throwing horse
shoes the other day was hearn to say, “I
don’t Tommy vous.”

Sydenstricker—Bascom, I borrow
your hat again?”
Sorrells—Sure, why the formality?

Sydenstricker—Oh, I can't find it.

Prof—Has any one else a question ?
E. C. Moomaw—Yes, what time is it?

In the spring youn men’s fancies lightly
\turn to what the girls have been thinking
about all winter.

The only difference between ‘When
Knighthood was in Flower” and the present
day is:

In days of old, a knight would take
A horse and suit of tin,

And with a ten foot pole would try
His lady’s love to win.

But now he takes a bus of tin
And fills her up with gas,

And miles and miles away from town
He woes his winsome lass.

Carried out in Math last week, while the
prof. was explaining a problem. “Now,
|Gentlemen, watch the board while I run
| through it once more.”

| Fresh Joyner—What is the meaning of
| the word “Necking”?

Fresh McNair—“Necking” is the system
| of collaring a woman.

“I’m not sticking to facts”, said the stamp
,on the letter the student was writing to his
| dad,

There are meters Iambic

And meters trachaic,

And meters in musical tones,

But the meter that’s sweeter,
Completer and neater,

Is to meet her in the moonlight alone.

The Economic department wishes to call
| attention to the fact that umbrellas are more
expensive on rainy days because on those
| days they go up.

Will somebody notify Bob Gordon that
| Mr. Jackson said to please “come after cata-
logues during book room hours”?

| We sometimes think the same thing when
a fellow doesn’t answer when we say “Hello
| Gentlemen”.

NOTICE

The Peanut Parcher is going to try a
{new wrinkle in its department from ndéw on.
| We have the consent of the faculty, trustees,

and janitors so it ought to be all right.
| Each week there is going to be a column
entitled WE WANT. Every week we will
| ask the students to hand in their ideas as to
| what they want. It may be original or not,
poem or prose, but for the love of Pete
| don’t make it in Vachel Lindsay metre. We
| want what interested you—the other fellows
| will like it too. The best answers will be

reproduced in a column entitled WE HAVE,

with the contributor’s name under it. For
the first start the subject will be: 1. What
is college life? 2. Student ‘Problems—No. 1.
“GETTING UP”. This must be an orig-
inal, informative essay of not more than 75
words. Fellows, this is your department
and with a little get-to-gether we can make
it go. Hurry your contributions along to
thirty Georgia.

Captain Weems Will
Arrive Next September

Announcement has been made through the
R. O. T. C. headquarters that Captain Wea-
therby is to be transferred and his position
here is to be filled by Captain George H.
Weems, former West Point football star
and wrestling champion.

A native of Waverly, ‘Tenn., Captain
Weems entered the Academy in 1913, grad-
uating in 1917, For four years he was a
linesman on the football squad, and in
wrestling won the light-heavyweight cham-
pionship of West Point. He served as sec-
retary of the Y. M. C. A. for two years,
and as president of that organization during
his Senior year.

Upon graduation, Captain Weems was
assigned to the 9th Infantry, with which
regiment jhe saw active service overseas,
commanding a machine gun company. From
July to December, 1918, he was an instruct-
or in the army candidates’ school at Longres,
France; then he returned to the 9th Infan-
try.

Attached to the Army of Occupation in
Germany, Capt. Weems was not brought
back across the pond until May, 1919. For
fifteen months he was stationed at Camp
Travis, ‘Texas, with the 4th machine gun
battalion, next serving for two years ‘as in-
structor of military art at the Infantry
School near Columbus, Ga. At this school
he ably coached the linesmen on the foot-
ball squad.

This year Captain Weems has been taking
a company officer’s course, which he will
complete in June. He will arrive in Sep-
tember to take up his work at Davidson.

JUNIORS TO PUBLISH
HUMOROUS MAGAZINE

The present Junior, class has stepped into
a new field of endeavor a; yet untried by

any previous class, namely, the publication |

of a humorous magazine.

Twelve members of the class of ’24 are
getting out a magazine which will probably
be distributed during Junior Speaking. ‘This
magazine is to be made up similar to other
humorous college publications, such as the
Cornell Widow and The Virginia Reel. It
is expected that this magazine will he re-
ceived with a great deal of interest since
it is the first time in the history of Davidson
College that a publication of this nature
has been attempted by any of its students.

The name of the magazine is to be Cap
and Bells. It will be thirty-six pages in

A MERRY DRAMA

Act the Ninth

ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES

Mac—Listen to this little ditty I just
heard—

Bill—Can it, old dear, can it.

Mac—Oh, all right. But say, why the
swanky duds which clothe thy person?

Bill—Oh, I’m just breaking in some new
spring stuff.

Mac—What’s the brand?

Bill—H ickey-Freeman suit, Manhattan
shirt, Paisley cravat, Clapp shoes, and I
have a John B. Stetson in the closet.

Mac—Strutting the old mess for a change,
eh, what? And might I ask the origin of
such classy duds?

Bill—Easiest question I ever answered.
Mellon’s old dear, Mellon’s.

REBUILING CAMPAIGN
PROGRESSING RAPIDLY

The $600,000 campaign for rebuilding
Chambers Hall is progressing nicely, says
Mr. Lockhart, the campaign director. Sub-
scriptions to date amount to something like
$430,000 and it is hoped that the total will
be $500,000 dollars within the next sixty or
ninety days.

The quota for Mecklenburg County has
been fixed at $100,000. Of this amount
$77,000 has already been raised and the cam-
paign managers for the county expect to go
over the top in the drive between April 4th
and 14th. The plan is to find five men or
women in Charlotte, or the county, who will
subscribe $5,000 each, filling out the quota
by a small margin,

A telegram received at the campaign head-
quarters in Charlotte from Doctor Martin
states that work will be begun on one wing
of the building within sixty days. The pur-
pese is to complete a number of classrooms
so that they may be ready for use by Sep-
tember, 1923. The rest of the building will
be erected as soon thereafter as possible.

The new building to contain thirty
memorial classrooms. These rooms will be
dedicated to the donor or to some person
who has subscribed as much as $5,000, and
will be named accordingly. Of this num-
ber thirteen have already been spoken for
and the proper subscriptions have been
made. Subscriptions for the remaining sev-
enteen will bring the campaign well toward
its goal, and with other subscriptions which
will come in in the meantime they should
swell it to the $600,000 mark.

All plans for the campaign have been
completed except those in the synods of
Florida and Georgia where for some reason
they have been delayed.

The building contract has not yet been let
but is still open for bids.

length and the cover will be printed in two
red and black. Seatterd through-
out will be several drawings contributed by
two members of the class. Many humorous
short stories and anecdotes, together with
jokes and exchanges, will add to the interest
of the publication.

This is to be the one and only issue of
the magazine as it is to be considered as a
part of the Junior Week program. One
copy will be given free to each member
of the student body, the faculty, the officers
of administration, and to each visitor on
the hill.
