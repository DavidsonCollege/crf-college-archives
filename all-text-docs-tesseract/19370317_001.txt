STARTED YESTERDAY

“Buck” Is Pastor of Hunting-
ton, W. Va., Church

The Rey. A. L. “Buck” Cur-
rie, pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church in Hunting-
ton, W. Va., opened the annual
Y. M. C. A. Spring Services
here Tuesday at the chapel pe-
riod.

“Learning To Live From Christ”
is the general theme upon which
Rey. Currie is basing his services
this week. During the series of six
services he intends to show from
example how Christ lived under the
various conditions of life as they are
still met today.

Christians In Demand

“Christians in Demand,” was the
subject of the opening service Tues-
day morning. Taking as a text—
the whole creation groaneth for the
manifestations ofthe sons of God
—he showed how we might show
ourselves td be the sons of God in
answer to the world’s call to us to
supply it with its greatest need—
Christians. When the-men of old,
Simon Peter, Nathaniel, and John
the Baptist saw Jesus they knew he

was the son of God for in him they
came face to face with the same
virtues which we may emulate if
we desire to live like Christ. They
knew Christ for (1) the gracefulness
of his goodness, (2) the dignity he
possessed in time of trouble, (3)
the spirit he showed as
problems of every-day life.
The Rested Heart
“Learn of me and ye shall find
rest for your soul,” was the text for
the service Tuesday evening. Mr.
Currie pointed out that one of the
great troubles of our day is trying
to keep our hearts against the wear
and tear of the vibration of mod-
ern living for this robs us of our
greatest spiritual efficiency. How
did_Jesus keep his heart?*He found
rest for his soul because of first,
his faith in God’s will; second, his
faith in his fellow man, and third
his faith in his cross.

Bill Bradburn: “I think that it is

“T don't see why you can't do it
