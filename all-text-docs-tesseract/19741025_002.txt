All. single students. will be
required to pay a compulsory
laundry fee through the 1977-
78 school year according to
College Business Manager
Robert A. Currie.

Currie explained that
present plans for phasing out
the laundry involved con-
tinuing the full compulsory fee

for 1975-76 and reducing laun-

dry services and fees for the
years 1976-77 and 1977-78.
“Since it is not feasible t

operate on a voluntary basis,
the fee must remain com-
pulsory as long as we continue
in the laundry business, Currie
stated.

“It’s just our feeling that
we'd lose money with a volun-
tary operation. That’s just my
own opinion,”’ he added.

According to College Comp-
troller Robert W. Davidson,
the college-operated laundry
has been losing money for
years.

“Since I’ve been here
(4968), there has always been
a Small loss,’’ said Davidson.

Last year the laundry
operated at a loss of $7398.

not like to be in the laundry
business,”’ Currie said. ‘But
~ we're in; "and we run it only as
a service to students. We think
that this plan is an orderly
way of phasing it out.’’

Last spring, the Student
Government Association
studied the laundry, con-
ducted a referendum, and
recommended that the laun-
dry services be offered to
students on a voluntary basis.

““t don’t foresee the laundry
being voluntary,’’ Currie said

College Laundry Manager
Frances Beaver agreed with
Currie. ‘‘The demand to make
the laundry fee and services
voluntary involves the num-
ber of employees we have in
the laundry,”’ she said.

At- present, there are ap
proximately 30 workers em-
ployed in the laundry, working
either full or part-time.

“Imposing the compulsory
laundry fee seems about the
only way we can run the laun-
dry to meet student needs and
to be fair to the employees in
the laundry,” said Davidson.

explained, ‘‘We are at-
tempting to phase down by not
replacing employees when
they retire. Also, employees
are to be transferred to other
college departments wher.

possible.”

However, at the present
time, the college is employing
seven retired people to work
part-time in the laundry. Two
more employees will reach
retirement age at the end of
this year, and four more by
the end of, the 1975-76 school
year.

“These people are receiving
their Social Security benefits

and they don’t want to make
more money than they can
and still receive their
benefits,’’ said Davidson.
‘Beaver expressed skep-
ticism about the Honor Code
being upheld by Davidson
students if the laundry fees
and services were voluntary.
**You couldn’t work it on the
henor system. Students
couldn’t walk in and out of the
laundry as they do now. For

example someone who
doesn't pay a laundry feé
might»throw his’ laundry in
with his roommate’s. It would
be very confusing,”’ she said

‘Trustees Interested

In Low-Key Beering

By MARK GERGEN

The Trustee Student Life
and Health Committee will
decide this weekend
whether Davidson will apply
for a license to sell beer. If the
vote is affirmative, the matter
will be brought up before the
full board. 3

Director of the Student
Union C. Shaw Smith stated,
“We are definitely continuing
to ask permission from the
trustee committee which is
responsible for social life. So

far they have indicated in-
terest.’’

Smith went on to say that he

contribution system was used,
where students were en-
couraged to make a con-
tribution for free beer. This
system is prohibited by law.

At that time it was decided
to wait until the new Union
was ready before applying for
a license. Since then the Union
has resorted to ‘‘checking”’
beer at parties, while
providing the cups.

“Under the past system
students have shown that they
can handle beer as a low key
thing. Students didn’t abuse
the privilege because the
scheme was well worked out.
It was a low pressure
situation,” Smith

He stressed that so long as ‘
