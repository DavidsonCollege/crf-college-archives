Davidson's Honor

We are deeply disturbed over the
seemingly rash criticism of the David-
son honor system and, in particular,
the Honor Court that has arisen this
week following the most recent de-
cision of the court.

Believing that the previously ac-
cepted practice of treating specific
cases of the court as confidential
matter is worthwhile, we would prefer
to withhold lengthy comment on this
specific case. Yet, the recent charges
that have been leveled at the David-
son honor system should not remain
aloof, although they hardly deserve
’ any answer.

it is indeed healthy that honest
criticism be a part of any academic
community: however. the sudden re-
action to the svstem immediately aft-
er one specific case seems rather
giddy.
The 40-year-old system has been a
source of self-respect for many stu-
dents. It has undoubtedly grown
stronger through the years and rests
in very capable hands among the 12
members of the court today.

Each case that the Honor Court
handles has its own unique back-
ground and implications. The most
recent one is no exception.

It is unusual that the court must
convene on another campus as it did
earlier this week in order to hear the
case involving a Davidson student.
Nevertheless, distance or location
should not preclude the complete air-
ing of testimony.

Because the witnesses involved
were students at another school, we
fee] that the court was justified in
conducting their proceedings away
from the Davidson campus. .

The personality of the student in
this case has most likely prompted
the discussion that has arisen this

a

week. Yet, the honor system would
not function properly at all if its code
of regulations did not apply equally
to each student.

We have the upmost respect for the
integrity of Davidson’s 12-man court.
The decision in this case, as in eve
instance, was reached after solid testi-
mony was heard, we feel sure.

Nevertheless, the court could have

revented some needless questions

rom arising by a more tactful presen-
tation of some of the details of the
specific case. Announcing the de-
cision of the court before the appeal
to a faculty committee had been heard
was out of order, in respect to the ac-
cused and to an unprejudiced hearing
by the committee.

Also, the court broke precedence
by posting an announcement of its de-
cision on dormitory bulletin boards.
The typewritten notices stating the
bare facts of this case seemed for
many students to indicate a rather un-
usual nature in this instance.

We do not hold the system or the
court in sacred trust. Yet, it should
be open to a sincere concern and
awareness of the entire student body
at all times.

But the air of emotionalism and
the foolish and rash statements that
have characterized much of the discus-
sion this week is no way to carry on
a serious evaluation of any program.

Students who harbor serious ques-
tions about the honor system here, or
about any establishment on the David.
son campus for that matter, would do
well to present their opinions in and
through the proper channels—in the
forum of THE DAVIDSONIAN or to
the Student Council—instead of fill-
ing the air with damaging generalities
and smearing charges.

Anti-War Demonstrators |

The anti-Viet Nam demonstra-
tions that provided so much head-
line and television fodder over the
weekend have no potential to
change American policy, but they
add visibly to the pain of pursuing
it...

When all is said and done a
U. S. Commitment anywhere — and
especially in Viet Nam—from which
there was no active dissent would be
more ominous than what we have.
It would be an indication of dan-
gerous callousness if the incidental
bombing of women and children,
the obliteration of whole villages,
did not bring a few public con-
sciences to the breaking point. . . .

Short of total and undiscrimi-
nating pacifism, short of the con-
demnation of all violence, the dem-
onstrators — in their silence about
the “crimes” of the Viet Cong —
have no real case.

—Greensboro Daily News

* #¢ &

It must be stressed that, how-
ever damaging, the peacemongering
of the past weekend represented
the view of a small minority. At the
University of Chicago, for example,
only 200 of 8,000 students turned
out for a “teach-in.” Only 100 of
14,000 students at the University of
Colorado showed up for a “peace pa-
rade.” And at the University of
Michigan, national headquarters for-
the demonstrations, a scant 300 of
32,000 students participated in a
“peace vigil,” while 2,057 students
there signed a 32-foot-long tele-
pram to the President in support of

. S. policies in Viet Nam. ...

Still, Americans have every
right to be shocked that nearly
100,000 pacifists, beatniks, dedi-
cated Communists, and screwballs,
along with some simply misguided
youths, could be mustered for the
weekend demonstrations. Although
the dregs of society, of whatever fac-
tion and however outnumbered or
wrongheaded, have a right to pro-
test and oppose the policies of their
government, those behind the week-
end spectacle have exceeded the tol-
erable limits of free speech and dis-
sent.

—Richmond Times-Dispatch

The anti-war demonstrators
‘would certainly exhibit a great
sense of realism if they addressed
their calls for peace to the Commu-
nist capitals and not solely to Wash-
igton. But any blunderbuss effort
to suppress the demonstrations and
to depict all the leaders as Commu-

nist wreckers will be to help invest
them with the armor of martyrdom
so many of the dissenters plainly
desire. It will also raise questions
about the consistency of American
dedication to the very principles of
democracy and freedom which the
United States seeks to champion
around the world.

—The New York Times
e ¢ s

(The demonstrators) may well
have reached their high-water mark
even this past weekend when per-
haps as many as 100,000 turned out
in several cities to follow their lead-
ers, wave their placards and shout
their slogans. But 10,000 nitwits
out of nearly 200 million people
constitute a tiny minority, and the
people of this country know it.

The danger is that the men in
Hanoi and Peking will not under-
stand this. They may misread the
demonstrations as meaning our gov-
ernment’s policy in Viet Nam is be-
ing undermined at home, and, if so,
they can be expected to hang on
and prolong the war.

—The (Washington, D. C.) Evening
Star

The real motivations of demon-
strators and of the anti-draft forces
is not entirely clear. The draft sys-
tem is inequitable in a number of
respects and should be reformed.
But practically all ‘those who are
burning draft cards seem to be col-
lege youths who benefit most from
loopholes in the system. ...

The demonstrators did not con-
tribute to debate over Viet Nam.
They only made rational debate
more difficult.

And they certainly have not
brought peace any closer in Viet
am.

— Winston-Salem Journal
¢ s s

The demonstrations against the

U. S. role in South Viet Nam remind
us once again what a varied collec-
tion of nuts can crawl out of the
woodwork at any given time in this
country. ...
_ _ The demonstrators are betray-
ing their country and keeping faith
with the enemy whether or not the
letter of the law agrees.

They have been far too charit-
ably treated because of the great
principle in this country that a man

as a right to speak his mind. They
should be treated with the greatest
contempt.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Childs Advises Critics:
‘Study Cause Of Violence’

Dear Editor:

_I object to the statement in
last week's unsigned editorial,
“A Recent Trend.” that I mis-
stated objective fact. Since my
letter was entirely evaluative
and contained no designated
statements: I do not think I can

be charged with mistating facts.

Your suggestions that 1) I am
a Naming radical and 2) that
Y wrote the letter to defend my
roommate say something about
the ability of your editors to
read carefully and critically, but
they do not say anything about
my letter or the riots in Watts.

Contrary to your view that I
should not have dismissed the
arguments of Will Herberg. I
feel that I am both entitled to do
so as well as obligated to do so.
The fact that Mr. Herberg holds
King’s views to be the cause of
the Los Angeles riots does not
prove that they were the cause,
and Mr. Clark's agreement
merely weakens the argument in
mv opinion.

First, I understood King's posi-
tion to be in support of breaking
the law only when the. Jaw is
considered unjust and the “law
breaker” is willing to take the
consequence of his action. In no
case do I remember that viol-
ence was approved or advocat-
ed.

Secondly, anyone who was at
all familiar with the riots in
California would know that the
rioters not only rejected the
leadership of King, but also
hooted him and the advocates of
his views as “Uncle Toms.”

I deplore violence in any form.
but as I suggested before, the
basic cause of the violence (the
predicament of the Negro in our
society) must be our real con-
cern.

Dear Editor:

Originally, I had not planned
to write an exegesis of my own
Jetter, but reactions of dismay
and disgust cannot be ignored.
The purpose was to lift the con-
text of discourse from the emo-
tional cliches in which it {s cus-
tomarily phrased.

What I described as a ‘‘dialo-
gue” was in part a caricature
of anti-fraternity ‘zealots,’ the
point being that fraternities
alone are not responsible for the
charges of anti-intellectualism,
ete. The Admissions Committee.
for example, may be even more
responsible.

Fraternities are symptomatic
of “ossified Davidsonians,” of
the traditions that are often an
impasse for logical analysis.
Further, the ‘‘atypical’’ charact-
er of colleges as opposed to that
of “reality” raises significant
questions: the interrelationship
of society. Davidson college, and
social fraternities.

Commager's words present an
old, but I think important ideal
— what might loosely be termed
the relativity of ideas. Despite
the fact that the second part of
the quotation applies specifical-
ly to public institutions, it has
implicative force for the nature
of Davidson's church affiliation.
. That secial groups and their:
attendant ‘“‘status discrimina-
tion” will exist almost inevitably
js not challenged; that the pe-
culiar Greek-letter corollary is
necessary or even desirable is
debatable. I applaud both the
purpose and the efforts of the
Social Life Evaluation Commit-
tee. How this committee defines
the goals Davidson College will
be extremely interesting.

Dear Editor:

This week I received.a bill for
$45.00 from the college as a
penalty for achieving, in this
case by taking three semester
hours more than the prescribed
maximum set by the college.
Just assuming for a moment
that I was wrong in my reason-
ing that taking extra hours was
not a cause for extra charges,
the conditions of the assessment
are more than somewhat unfair.

Following traditional preced-
ents, the college made no in-
formation available to returning
students concerning changes in
costs of various services of the
college. This information was
contained in both the catalogue
and the Wildcat Handbook, but
few upperclassmen have access
to either of these prior to the
first day of school.

No communication was con-
sidered necessary, even though
laundry fees; board fees, and
other incidentals were raised.
not to mention that the “normal
load” restriction ‘was lowered
from eighteen to sixteen hours.
This last means that a large
percentage of the student body
is forced to pay fifteen dollars
per hour for the privilege of
working harder and sacrificing
leisure time.

The logic of the extra charge
does not completely escape me:
I am certain that, were there no
restrictions, mobs of students
seeking true knowledge in stag-
gering quantities would throng
into overcrowded classrooms —
but I do think that the least that
could be done is to notify stu-
dents of changes in regulations
and charges before they return
to school.

HUED REDDISH-ORANGE and sometimes yel-
low, the leaves have just started changing here at
Davidson because hazy Indian summer was long with
us this vear. Homecoming '65: for the '69ers, their
first college weekend — for the seniors, the last
Homecoming as we know them. But we are still here.
And while the good times are not long, they are not
gone.

WITHOUT THE DANCE-WEEKENDS there is
something sterile in this campus, in straight acade-
mics minus participation. We read in epistemology
and micro-biology and the functions of a complex
variable, there is Chaucer and Tillich and Commager,
and for awhile these words are alive and we particip-
ate in them. But their words will call up still deeper
urges, they cannot hold and we cannot explain.

So it is time to leave only the classes for awhile.
And we point to our books and our papers and our
fifteen class hours per week to ask: Is our education
not something niore than this?

* e

HAVE OUR PROFESSORS FORGOTTEN? What
it was like to leap slightly drunk among piles of crisp
scarlet leaves and to hold weird dialogues beside
Lake Norman under a cold moon? How important
it once was to date the right girl and to get the ex-
pensive liquor and to have the best combo-party at
a camp lodge, you and your friends?

Our professors have their wives and families.
Do their wives remember, did they know? How im-
ortant it was for the girl to have her date smile at
er, how secretly proud she was to come to a David-
son weekend? How great she felt in leaving her silly
school rules and home mores for awhile — how she
could Jaugh and dance and maybe even get a little
high, if not on the drinks then on the music and the
restless moods?

These men — our fathers, our professors, our
older friends — have they forgotten what it was like
to bounce around with those unspeakable moods of
ecstacy and despair? How sometimes the single in-
stant of intimacy or instght was worth all the future
shot to hell?

___ These older ones, do they realize how necessary
is this “foolishness” if we are to rebuild their torn-
up world?

SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE DAVIDSON a GI
screams and claws at his belly in the shock of a pain-
ful death from a jungle ambush. Americans, even
Davidson men, die in sleek silver planes that be-
come their coffins. And the people they die for cry
with unimaginable hunger and pain and disease,
while the arrogant pickets parade in our streets.

And even next door across the tracks, there are
those men and those women whose broken spirits
and services we exploit. And there is even more hate
and fear and loneliness until I wonder if we can ever
be clean and guiltless again.

This is the world we have made and yet did not
make. How different it is from the campus, how
necessary it is that we have a taste of honey, lest we

‘orget.

® *

BUT THERE WILL BE PARTIES and a football
team that is finally winning and concerts and all
things that make a dance weekend really great. There
is all this and more in the wild swirling tangle of
moods that is a Davidson weekend.

__ How will you who are dates remember us? We
will remember you: Remember the cute way you
laughed lat our self-conscious jokes, remember the
skilled or clumsy ways you danced, you talked, you
put us at ease. Outside the parties in the sharp night
air, remember the way you stroked our hair and
looked off across the water as we babbled about the
feelings of eternity, the strong clear eyes that drank
in all the wildness and excitement that was our
dance weekend.

We will remember you — whether or not we
see you again. This was one of those moments when
time stopped and you shared for that moment this
part of our world, Davidson and Homecoming ’65.
