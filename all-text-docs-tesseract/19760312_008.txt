“The market value of our endow-
ment depends on the ups and downs
of the market. Our performance
in the market with Scudder, Stevens
and Clark (the college’s investment
counsel) has been very good. The fact
that the book value of our endowment
is low is the reason for this project,’’
said Williams.

Williams added that the $17 million
figure does not reflect the funding the
college receives annually from the
Duke Endowment. ‘The effective
figure of our endowment is about $35
million, of which we. manage about
$18 million.”

Williams also noted that David-
son’s endowment is not low when
compared with schools its size.

“There are some schools with larger
endowments, but there are a lot more
with smaller. There are very few
schools in the southeast with larger
endowments than Davidson.”’

The project statement gives pro-
jected income and expense budgets
for each of the next ten years, and
states that the budgets assume there
will be no changes in the academic
program which would increase costs.
Williams said that this does not mean
that there will be no changes in the
program.

‘‘The budgets show the deficit
which we would incur if we operated
with the present faculty and program
during the next ten years. This is our
case to donors for more money.

“Surely no one who is interested in

stagnant--we need to grow. We need
to find funds not only to avoid a
deficit, but also to grow,’’ said
Williams.

Williams emphasized that there
was no danger of the college operating
with a deficit budget. ‘‘We would
adjust and cut to have a balanced
budget. But the program would
suffer.’’

Spencer said that it is not the
intention of the project to limit
changes in the academic program.

The project statement also shows
that Davidson's tuition is lower than
average for private colleges. Spencer
commented on the use of increased
tuition as a means to more operating
money for the college.

financial stagnancy

“In the past, it’s had to be a source.
But the problem with this is that our
competition is not just the private
colleges, but also public colleges. We
are competing with Chapel Hill, and
that is formidable competition.
Chapel Hill is a good school. We can
price ourselves out of the market by
raising student fees,” said Spencer.

Williams pointed out the dangers of
increased tuition. ‘‘We are getting
dangerously close to the point where
only the affluent can afford to come to
Davidson.

‘‘That’s why financial aid is so
important. If we raise tuition, we
have to raise additional endowment
for financial aid so that others besides
the affluent can afford to come here to
school,”’ said Williams.

Attendance figures at Dav-
idson basketball games in the
Charlotte Coliseum and
Johnston Gym have athletic
department officials worried.

‘I don’t think we lost so
much money that the entire
athletic budget will show a
deficit, but, financially speak-
ing, this year was one of the
worst for Davidson basket-
ball,’’ said Assistant Director
of Athletics Thomas Couch.

When the Wildcats play at
the Coliseum, the College pays
the city of Charlotte a flat
rental rate plus 12’ percent of
the gate receipts. Davidson
pays another fee dependent
upon the number of sections
opened for seating. Finally,

guards on duty at each game.

“The overhead at. Charlotte
Coliseum is tremendous.
Season ticket sales are the
only thing that saved us this

year. That income paid the
overhead and helped us avoid
major monetary losses,’’ said
Couch.

‘‘Before the season the
coaches assured us that this
year’s team was a good one, so"
we opened all the sections at
the Coliseum. The crowds
became smaller and smaller,
and we backed off our earlier
estimates, paying only enough
to open half the sections. We
couldn’t even fill those.’’

Rumors spread claiming
that Davidson was losing so
much money in Charlotte the
team might not play at the

was a bad one, it wouldn’t be
smart to move out of the
Coliseum,’’ Couch said.

‘If we hire a dynamic coach
who can recruit a couple more
talented players and tap the
potential of this year’s group,
Davidson can be in the top 20
as soon as next year.

Then we’ll be back in those
days of 10,000 attendance
when each Coliseum game
grossed $40,000 for the
school,’’ he continued.

“Receipts of games in
Johnston Gym-have never
been enough to cover ex-
penses Once We reserve one
side for the students and
another section for faculty and
staff, there aren’t enough tic-
kets left to sell to make any
significant sum of money.

we could expand the gym to

Losses are built into the
budgets. Final figures will be
computed soon, and if the
basketball losses do exceed the
planned estimate, funds would
have to be drawn from either
the athletic budget or the
general fund to compensate,’’
said Couch. The President
would decide where the money
is taken from,’’ he concluded.
