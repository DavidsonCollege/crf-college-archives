It has come to attention of this cor-

respondent, strictly through the grape-
vine, that plans are underway to block
off he “D”

the Chambers Building and enters Main

road which runs in front of

Street at either end of the campus. Even-
tual destruction of the road has even been
given consideration. The architect who
has recommended this proceedure is of
the opinion that cars parked along the
road in tront of Chambers distract from
the beauty of the campus and should
therefore be removed. In my opinion, we
might just as well destroy Chambers, for
without that road, it just wouldn’t seem
like Davidson College to a number of

from the scenery of our campus in any
way to me. In fact they may even enhance
the appearance of the campus in’ some
cases,
The “D” is a tradition at Davidson,
which in itself is no argument for its ‘re-
tention if the tradition is outmoded. There
is nothing worse than an institution of
higher learning which banks on a group
of musty moth eaten traditions to carry
it through, for unless traditions are sound
they soon become fiollow. But is this
tradition dusty and outmoded? I am in-
clined to think not. In talking with several
of the student body leaders on the cam-
pus, it seems that these men are in agree-
ment with me on the subject, and I feel
fairly certain that. the larger share of
the alumni would feel just as we do.

‘We've Got It - Let's Keep It ..

That renowned Wildcat spirit, that un-
definable something, about which yours
truly and several. other members of the
student body have been harping for the
past few weeks, is back on the Davidson
campus once again. It began to soar
shortly after that very fine chapel pro-

gram two weeks ago which was drawn

we are now certain will continue to beat
with renewed vigor in the years to come.

This And That
From Here And There

The Davidsonian Staff goes into sack

week with the loss of ace
and Feature Editor ‘‘Gentle-
man Jim” Jackson. The wildcat Pegler
was forced to give up his work on the
campus weekly due to his numerous other
campus activities. His style and wit will
be missed on the editorial page. Taking
over as columnist this week is Bob Rier-
son of Charlotte, N. C., whom we feel is
most capable of filling Jim’s shoes in the
feature department. While Bob is only a
second semester Sophomore, he has proven
his ability working with the staff this year
since his return to school after a -hitch in
Uncle Sam’s navy.

The laurel wreath goes to Mr. James
Christian Pfohl and his football band for
their unique and outstanding performances
week after week. The band gets a lot of
kidding from some of the student body,
they go through long periods of practice
to work up half time entertainment for
us, they. get very poor seats at the games,
but they are always there and they are

usually just about letter perfect. In
fact’ they are just about good enough
to be taken for granted by a goodty
number of our students. Hats off to

our music department for a job well
done.

Congratulations are in order for the
Pan-Hellenic Council for the excellant job
they did~on our Homecoming dances.
These men gave their time and energy

present a short description of Re-
gatso so that you will know him
next time. He is a short florid
man of tremendous circumference
and bulbuos snozzola, He wears
a pair of drape pants with high top
hat and tails, a T-shirt, and a green
and orange tie. Even if he changes
his T-shirt, the tie will remain the
same, so don’t worry. Now to go
on with his story, and I quote in
the learned one’s own words:

“.

“You know, I’ll never understand
why, but I didn’t get in the formal
on Friday night. I had my ticket
and got as far as the door, but
that fellow in the khaki suit took
one look at me and immediately
went through the ceiling into
the balcony, thoroughly perturbing
Trouthead and his woman who were
watching the dance below, of course.
(The ROTC Department wishes to
inform the Armory owners that the

bottle is located—Ed. note.)

politely suggested that I leave with
the aid of three pop bottles, a handy
two-by-four, and a stray freshman.
I was rather discouraged at the
time, but consoled myself with ihe
thought that Saturday would be my
big night.

“For the informal I arrived early
and was brightened by the sounds
of laughter and music issuing from
the depths of the Armory. For-
tunately I approached from a side
which did not lead me by the front
door of the place, unlike three
others of my acquaintance who were
last seen madly yodeling “Atomic
Power” in the middle of the Square
at four-thirty. They never made
the dance, poor guys! Anyway I
strode boldly up to the door and
brashly slung it open, not forget-
ting to cock my top hat a jaunty
angle. The act was useless, how-
ever, for a big, rolling, black wave
hit me, considerably clouding my
outlook on life for the moment. I
calmly picked myself up off the
ground after pushing back several
hundred coats, and, visibly shaken,
tried again. The door was open, but
I couldn’t see for some reason which
I later solved by using my jack-
knife to cut a peep-hole through
the smoke as I walked along. After
downing several healthy swigs of
RC which bolstered to a great de-
gree my morale, I advanced deter-
minedly onto the floor. When I
woke up I was reclining gracefully

jeral dealers to gaze darkly in my

My boy made several comments
on the situation as a whole which
IT shall for the sake of chastity with-
hold, but the gist of his argument
was, “Tell those guys to get more
RCs next time!”

Another friend of mine was heard
from only recently who asked me
to relay his words to the freshmen
in my audience (if such there be
—audience, that is).. He himself
was unable to appear before: me
due to a bad head injury incurred
while walking through the fresh-
man section of chapel. He has cal-
culated from the shape of the wound
that a well-worn brickbat did the
job. His name is Trye N. Fynme,
the man who knows what goes on
beneath every freshman cap. The
object of his letter was to inform
me, and consequently you, of a new
jinvention of his which will go to
make for better spirit at football
games. A special frosh seating sec-
{tion will be installed with built-in
| prings under each seat. An elec-
tric eye system-will be wired across
‘the Davidson goal line which, when
broken by a Davidson runner, will
release the coiled springs and cata-
pult the recalcitrant red-top to his
feet. A small amount of electricity
(approximately 2,000 volts) in the
springs will help to a considerable
degree with the cheering. May I
take the opportunity to reeommend
that the Faculty Committee on
Spirit Promotion consider this new
innovation with much contempla-
tion?

We of the Davidsonian staff wish
to congratulate Mr. Pfohl and the
band very highly for their magnifi-
cent display of bubble-manufactur-
ing at halftime. No one noticed
the change in humidity when said
bubbles burst, due to the rather
damp atmosphere which . pervaded
the campus for our Victory Home-
coming. An exclusive interview
with Mr. Pfohl has revealed an-
other clever plan for the Richmond
halftime ceremonies. Each band
member will go armed with a box
containing a well-grown Grand-
daddy spider to be released on
signal from Mr. Pfohl. I believe
this to be a rather original idea
and herewith state that I sincerely
hope the aforementioned grand-
fathers will take up with their
namesakes from Virginia to the
gridders’ utmost consternation.

The Operating Table.

Well, Homecoming has come and
gone with only a few instances of
dirt getting around to the roving
snoop.~However, we'll present these
and with the many others floating
verbally about the campus, we think
most of the deals will get before
the public. The biggest deals of
the week end were pulled by the
alumni’ though some of our own
boys made their way into pay dirt.

OLE BUDDY WHITESIDES is
seeking membership in the Spanish
club after an enjoyable  Sat-
urday evening with SOCIAL SAM
TATE’S gift in the form of a Cuban
beauty. LESTER PORT and

into the banquet late it seems leav-

gratulations to PETE “LOVER”

vouches for the heat along with sev-

eral other fellows.

The Phi Delt house is mourning
this week for three of its brothers
who may be seen now with their
pins displayed after a- sojourn to
other parties. How about it
OGLESBY, TODD, and McLEAN?
It is also understood that COLSON
is out of shape since returning to
school while the one and only seem-
éd to be in mid-season form. BILL
BRIMBERRY ABBOTT was seen
sulking about the campus today
after his one and only had come
up only to be occupied with other
fellows most of the week end. Title
of “Man of the Week” goes to
“FOOTSIE” CURRIE who isn’t
satisfied with the usual one date

for a week end but came up with
a different cutie each evening.

It seems that a portion of Dr.
C. K. BROWN’S Money and Bank-

ing class Friday was taken up with
a definition of FLUSHED which
he claimed was collegiate lingo
and out of his line of knowledge.
“TEXAS TERROR” POWELL was
given a rise to fame Saturday
evening when his date wrote and
read a poem concerning his deal-

banquet.

you “BONE”?

Down Fraternity Court

Pity ye old editor who finds
himself with six hundred . and
thirty-eight lines of fraternity
news for this week’s edition at 2:00
a. m. and no place for it to go.
Due to increased costs in printing
and a dwindling staff of reporters
it has become necessary that the
DAVIDSONIAN publish only four
pages weekly, and at the same time
the news from the Greek Lodges
has steadily grown out of all pro-
portion to the other news features.
For this reason, it has beeome
necessary that this week’s edition
go to press without the usual news
from the social fraternities. Dras-
tic changes must be made in the
fraternity column so this week's
write-up is devoted to giving in-
structions to the brothers of the

various organizations who will write
the news for their respective groups
in the future.

In order to be perfectly fair to
all parties concerned, only thirty
printed lines will be allowed each
lodge in future publications. All
stories must be typewritten to be
accepted by this office, and must
be typed at 68 spaces to the line
and double spaced. Fifteen lines
written in this manner will give
thirty printed column lines which
is the maximum which will be al-
lowed any group. Fraternity presi-
dents are requested to make sure
that their correspondents are
familiar with these regulations.
Articles WILL NOT BE ACCEPT-
ED unless these rules are complied
with.
