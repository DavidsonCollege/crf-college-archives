A NEW CONCEPT OF DAVIDSON
BASKETBALL — VICTORY

TOMORROW night’s NCAA finals in Louisville, Ky.,
will officially bring to a close the 1961-62 college basket-
ball season.

For Davidson College the season ended on March 1.
However, even though Lefty Driesell & Co. didn’t win
any championships or bring home any trophies, it was a
good year for basketball on our campus.

This year’s cage contingent did quite a few things
that no other Davidson five has been able to do in the

past. A few of the school records set this year include
the 12-game winning streak, the 110 points scored against |
Mississippi College, and the overall team free throw per-
centage of 72.8 for a season.

Furthermore, this year’s team compiled the best,
record that a Davidson team has had since 1949, beat)
the runner-up (Clemson) of the Atlantic Coast Confer-|
ence tournament, got into the Southern Conference
tournament for the first time since 1959, and finished
higher (fifth) in the conference than any Wildcat team
has done in the Good Lord only knows how long.

In addition, this year’s frosh quintet instilled a whole
new concept of basketball into the minds of the average
Davidson student. Seeing basketball played as they had
never seen it played before, the typical Davidsonian
discovered that watching a Davidson team in action could
be lots of fun and that victory is not an idealistic concept,
but, instead, something very tangible.

Driesell undoubtedly has a better nucleus with which
to work next season than any other Wildcat coach has
had in the past. But the Wildcat mentor is not making
any rash statements concerning next year’s possibilities,
even though a sly smile reveals his inward confidence.

For example, “How many games are we going to
win next year, Coach?” we inquired.

“Oh,” he retorted, ‘‘we ought to have a pretty good
season. We should be a little better than we were this
year. Of course, I like to think we can win ’em all.”

“What about a championship club?” we beamed.

“Well,” he drawled, “I thought we could win it this
year, remember? But we didn’t. Who knows? Maybe next
year we won’t even get into the tournament!”’

Despite these, to be frank, understatements, we got

the — we walked out of this man’s office that next
ear is going to be a big year for Davidson on the basket-
court. Certainly it will be one of the biggest chal-

— a Davidson team has ever faced schedule-wise.
Duke, Wake Forest, West Virginia, and Cincinnati are
among our opponents next year. The latter, the Cincinnati
Bearcats, who will be played on December 22 up there,
just may be national champions following this weekend’s
games in Louisville.

We also got the feeling that Lefty Driesell is a man
doing a man’s job. With a good crop of freshman en-
rolled this year and only three full scholarships available
for next year, it would be tempting to slack off recruiting.
But on his blackboard are dozens of names of, you can be
assured, top-notch i school cagers. The three scholar-
ships won't be wasted. ;

’Cats Host Touring Yale

— The sound of a swishing bat fills the air as GRAHAM SHOWALTER takes a
healthy cut during batting practice this week. But the ball settled snugly into the mitt of
catcher HARRY CLINE when Showalter missed. The baseball team entertains Yale tomorrow

afternoon at 1:30. (Staff Photo by McCutchen).

This past Tuesday the Ivy-
Leaguers clobbered Camp Le-

This afternoon on the home
field the ‘Cats sought revenge
against a Catawba team that
beat them, 12-6, this past Wed-
nesday in Salisbury.

The Indians took advantage of
several Davidson errors, which
paved the way for five runs.
Tommy Hamilton's two hits led
the ‘Cats at the plate, while
Jim Moore was effective during
a brief relief role on the mound

Top 3 I-F Cage Teams:

K Sigs, Fijis, and KA’s

The Kappa Sigs, Phi
Gams, and KA’s were firm-
ly established as the top
three fraternity basketball
teams this week.

The busiest of these three was
the KA’s, who put on a tre-
mendous stretch drive of six
straight wins to finish their
schedule with a 93 record,
clinching third place in the LF
standings.

The Kappa Sigs, who have al-
ready clinched the title with an
11-0 record, were idle, while the
Phi Gams, who own a 9-2 record
and who may have to share sec
ond place with the KA’s depend
ing on the outcome of their
Monday night battle with the
SAE’s, won by forfeit over the
Pi Kapps.

This week's I-F checklist:

On Tuesday the KA’s rolled
over the Phi Delts, 67-48, be-
hind the following four double
figure men: Rick Smyre (21),
Haynes Kelly (17), Sam Grimes
(13), and John Sharp (11). Dan
Calhoun and Nat Harris paced
the Delts’ attack with 14 and 12,
respectively.

On Wednesday the KA's clip-
ped the Independents, 47-41. In-
dependent Mark Dunn, the
league's top scorer, hit 19.

The following schedule for
Monday night, March 26, will
complete I-F basketball action:
7 p.m. - SAE vs. Phi Gam; 8:30
p.m. - Pi Kapp vs. ATO and
Kappa Sig vs. Sigma Chi.

Springtime is not so resy for everyone. For Davidson College's football players and for
college gridders throughout the nation, for instance, it is a time for hard knocks and bruises.
For rising sophomore football players the annual spring drills present a chance to get the inside
track on open positions left vacant by seniors. Here freshmen WILL JACKSON (centering) and
TOMMY WORRELL (foreground) listen to quarterback EARL COLE call signals. (Staff Photo by
