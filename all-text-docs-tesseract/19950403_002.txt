Blake takes the
helm of DCTYV,
brings new start

By SARAH TEACHWORTH

You didn’t know that
Davidson had its own television
station? Well, that’s all right, be-
cause neither did the station man-
ager until a few short weeks ago.
Freshman John Blake says of his
ascent to leadership, “One day I
found out we had a radio station.
The next day, I found out we had a
TV station. Six days later, I was
station manager.”

Blake wrote his name on the
sign-up sheet for committee chairs
at the Union. After about a week
and a few interviews, the Union
Board informed him that the job
was his.

Young’s job is by no means
being handed over to a video nov-
ice. During his high school days in
Brighton, Michigan, Blake and his
friends formed a small film com-
pany called Exclamation Entertain-
ment. The group made short films
and even produced a public ser-
vice announcement about gam-
bling which was shown to his en-
tire school.

The equipment Blake used
for his projects with Exclamation
Entertainment was adequate, but
he definitely feels that DCTV is a
step up. “I may want more sophis-
ticated equipment in the future,”
he says, “but what we have now is
a good stepping stone.”

Various assignments have
kept Blake busy since day one. Just
this week he has taped the Sexual-
ity Forum, Patricia Ireland’s talk,
and the SGA’s weekly meeting.
Each of these videos were funded

by and are property of their respec-
tive sponsors. Copies are kept by
DCTV incase the station later de-
cides that it wants to air them on
Channel 14.

Blake’s goal is to one day
achieve 24-hour programming.
This would entail a six hour block
of programming shown four times
a day. His plan is to air the block
for a week while producing a new
one.

The task sounds difficult, but
Blake is confident that it is pos-
sible, partly because such program-
ming was achieved only a few years
ago.

Though nothing is certain, he
is toying with ideas of having alive
talk show, a fictional Davidson
College mini-series, and a Real
World-esque show set in a senior
apartment.

Blake summarizes this inno-
vative thinking by quoting Robert
Henri: “We are nothere todo what
has already been done.”

Scholars spend
the weekend

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Staff writer

Last weekend marked the first
“Scholars Weekend” for Admis-
sions and Financial Aid. Seventy-
four out of 121 invited prospective
students arrived on campus to com-
pete for 10 different scholarships.

Students interviewed: with
faculty and students, presented art
portfolios, and performed for criti-
cal audiences.

Other activities scheduled for
the scholars and their parents in-
cluded campus tours, small group
discussions with current Davidson
students, an open house at the se-
nior apartments, a cookout at Dr.
Kuykendall’s house, and a picnic
lunch with parents of current
Davidson students and recent
Davidson graduates.

Until this year, this “‘celebra-
tion of excellence” has been held
in conjunction with Decision
Davidson.

The Financial Aid and Ad-
missions staffs chose to devote a
separate weekend to the event
mainly because of two new schol-
arships offered: The Thompson S.
Baker Scholarship and the John M.

Belk Scholarship. The recipients
of these scholarships will receive a
scholarship equal to the compre-
hensive cost of Davidson.

Other scholarships included

- the Romare Howard Bearden Art

Scholarship, the Patricia D.
Cornwell Prize for Excellence in
Writing, the Donald Plott Music
School Scholarship, and the Will-
iam Holt Terry Scholarship.

Recipients of the scholarships
have been chosen and will be noti-
fied early next week.

The weekend was organized
by Kristi Kessler, Assistant Dean

‘of Admission and Financial Aid,

and Associate Dean of Admission
ahd Financial Aid Kathleen

_Stevenson-McNeeley. They agree

that the success of the weekend
largely depended on the efforts of
the whole Davidson College com-
munity. Stevenson-McNeeley
says, “Everyone was very much
involved with this weekend, and
the Admissions Office is very
grateful.”

Members of the Admission
and Financial Aid staffs will soon
decide whether Decision Davidson
and Scholars Weekend will remain
separate events in the future.
