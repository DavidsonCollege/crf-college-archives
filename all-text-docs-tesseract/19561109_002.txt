A.B. Requirements Should Be Changed

Demand for a change in the College's
degree requirements has overnight be-
come the latest campus cause celebre.

As the rules now stand, to qualify for
a Bachelor of Arts degree, a candidate
for graduation must have completed at
least two years of Greek or Latin. In most
of the nation’s leading liberal arts insti-
tutions, the classical language require-
ment for an arts degree has been dropped
or modified in the past half-century.

Locally, the argument is this. Distinc-
tion between the arts and sciences has
been lost when history, English and even
philosophy majors are awarded a Bache-
lor of Science degree, simply because of
lack of a classical language. The basic
incongruity seems obvious.

In the class graduated last June, out of
107 men enrolled in the arts curriculum,
only 22 of these received an A.B. degree.
Under the present system, the number
qualified seems destined to slump even
more in future years, as only eleven
freshmen are currently planning to ful-

fill requirements for an A.B.

The movement for modification has
gone through most of the normal chan-
nels designated for student-initiated re-
forms, and has received almost 100% en-
dorsement. Editorials have been duly
written, and one literary society has fea-
tured a program on the topic. The Stu-
dent Council formally added its consider-
able weight to the movement by unani-
mously favoring the change.

As for faculty feeling, all indications
are that there is no noticeable opposition
to a change. Many individual faculty mem-
bers are quick to agree that the require-
ment is outmoded.

At present, the proposal is in the
hands of the faculty Curriculum Com-
mittee, as it has been for the past three
years. Since there seems to be little ap-
parent opposition, it would be gratifying
to see student interest and opinion re-
cognized by the powers that be in the
near future.

Freedom Out of Darkness

A concerned world has turned its eyes
toward the Middle East and Eastern Eu
rope with great intensity in the past two
weeks. Events have occurred with such
rapidity that no one has a complete view
of the whole scene and its significance.

Individual elements are dealt with and
there are many lessons to be learned. To
those of us who have regarded our stretch
as students as a time of foment for later
action the fact that the university stu-
dents of Hungary and Poland have spark-
ed the emotionalism of the revolt should
cause us to stop and reassess our respon.
sibilities as citizens.

One is reminded, too, of what a com.
plex thing man is. He has it in him to
stoop to the most degrading cruelties
and inhumanities which would shame a
jackal. Yet, in his best moments, he is
literally sublime, and but a little lower

than the angels, even as the Psalmist has
said.

A lot of this latter quality has been
seen in recent days. And for both the
Communists in Moscow and for us, there
is a lesson to learn.

The desire for individual status, free-
dom, and dignity cannot be dissected out
by dogma, terror or propaganda. Neither
the Kremlin nor America should fail to
note the deep significance of this.

These students must range from 18 to
22 years of age, meaning they were some-
where between 6-12 years old when Com-
munists took over their country. From
the outset their education has been built
around the Communist viewpoint and
their instructors have spouted only the
dogma of communism.

Today’s revolutionists are the ones who
learned the slogans, who marched in the
parades, who have been taught that the
individual did not count. To them it was
said that the state and its glory was all
that mattered. And, since it was a Marxist
state, committed to the people, to quest-
ion it was to be a traitor and merit only
death or prison.

So ran the stuff that was poured into
their ears. It generally was assumed they

were lost to democracy—that since: they
had known nothing else, they were devout
Communists.

But, now they die with a gallantry
which touches all our hearts and stirs our
imagination. Having been taught that
they, by loyalty to the state, would be
members of a Utopia in which all would
be free and share equally in the products
of the Industrial Revolution, we might ex-
pect apathy and no initiative.

Having seen the truth by looking
around at the lack of abundance and free-
dom in the countries about them, they
reached a peak of courageous action and
independent thought. Would that we had
the same spirit to the same degree.

They saw the lie.—F.L.H.

Poor Tar Heels

Some folks really have it rough.
Chapel Hill, for instance.

They've had lots of troubles over there
at Carolina. A non-winning Jim Tatum
must be a big enough problem in itself.
In addition, they've got parking problems.
Seems the Board of Alderman outlawed
parking on Columbia Street, where sev-
eral of the fraternity houses are located,
and there’s no place for the men to leave
their cars anymore.

But as if this wasn’t enough, the
wretched phone company had the audaci-
ty to put non-pay phones on only the first
and third floors in the dormitories. What
about the poor guys on the second and
fourth floors?

It’s like the Daily Tar Heel says, “Very
few dormitory men are going to want
to hike up and down stairs to make long
distance phone calls.” Well, we should say
not!

The last word was that the insuffer-
able old telephone company was finally
installing pay phones—in every room, we
presume. This absurd walking up and
down a flight of stairs just to make a
telephone call must go.

We sure hope they get that mess
straigthened out over there. College life
is trying enough without such inexcus-
able inconveniences.

The sovereign voice of a demo-
cratic people has spoken and de-
clared .itself .overwhelmingly in
favor of a continuation of the
Risenhower-Nixon team. All Amer-
icans will loyally support the pres-
ident for the next four years.

eo e©¢0¢@ ¢© 82 8

Loyal support doses not mean a
blind acceptance of his policies
when we think they are wrong.
Rather, it signifies a reasoned com-
pliance with general policy, while
attempting to point up inconsist-
encies or programs which we Jee]
are bad for America. Democracy
ean only work when a healthy op-
position stands ready to challenge
the party in power. The Demo-
cratic Congress will form a
healthy opposition, indeed.

Many of us have been amazed at
the sudden interest in foreign af-
fairs which has developed on cam-
pus in the past few weeks. Never
before have we seen Davidson stu-
dents wait up for the midnight
newscast or talk of nothing but
international relations over the
dinner table. We deplore the
means which have brought this
about, but we are pleased with
the end result. Doesn’t this yield
more interesting conversation than
how you flunked your last review?

Already the newspapers are car-
rying ads and the store windows
are carrying displays for Christ-
mas shoppers. It seems they start a
little earlier every year. In re-
cent years the Christmas Club
has made its advent to assure an
economic consideration of Christ-
mas all year.

When to give a gift equal to,

or better than, the Jones’ becomes
so important that one has ‘to
plan for it all year, then perhaps
we should stop exchanging gifts
with the Joneses altogether.

Sunday night we were having
@ bull session which yielded some
interesting ideas. It was pointed
out that when a college admini-
stration admits fraternities it ob-
viously does so with the idea that
they will be able to act in some
phases of college life in a manner
superior to the way the admini-
stration has been acting. Such
phases as social life, disciplinary
problems, study problems, and
eating facilities.

The idea is that a small group of
40 or 50 men who know each
other intimately can do these
things better than a group of men
who are removed from the prob-
lems.

Dear Editor,

Alas! What has happened to the
once familiar sight on the Salem
campus, the Davidson boy?

Not so long ago, there was a
time when someone thought of
Salem he thought of Davidson, too.
We told our incoming frosh that
even if Wake Forest would be
here, most of the girls would be
dating Davidsonians and there
wasn’t any better place to have
a good time on a weekend than
Davidson.

Lightning strike us upperclass-
men liars! The dateroom is al-
most void of Wildcats on Saturday
nights and the day has arrived
when there can be only one girl
in a car going to Homecoming.

Is it because the summer put a
few pounds on some of us? Is it be-
cause our ankles are not the right
shape? Or is it because the Salem
Girls have forgotten how to smile
in that certain way that appeals?
(I doubt that.)

Of one thing we are sure, the
facetious idea that Wake Forest

We believe that the fraternities
can carry out these functions in
a superior way. We doubt, how-
ever, that many of us ‘in the fra-
ternity system realize the respon-
sibility that we have been entrust-
ed with.

Now is a time, we believe, for
serious evaluation of our present
policies and the laying of imme-
‘diate and long range policies which
will strengthen not only our own
fraternities, but the fraternity sys-
tem as a whole.

The other night we saw the re-
hearsal for The Rainmaker, the
Masquers’ latest production. We
happened to see this same play
a couple of years ago with the
Broadway cast. It’s our opinibn
that those who see the Davidson
version will be seeing a good
proximity, of Broadway talent here
at little D.C.

Carl Cooper's address in chapel
last Friday was, we believe, one of
the best we have heard given by
a student since we have been here.
Many other students agree with
us.

Those of us who feel this way
should remember that good talks
are of no avail unless action is
taken to make their principles a
reality. Each of us must begin
to examine ourselves to see when
we are making attempts to en-
courage undue conformity.

Only as we come to recognize
and respect individuality can Da-
vidson hope to attain higher goals
and produce other Woodrow. Wil-
sons. The conformist seldom makes
a significant contribution to the
stream of life.

Walks here a man with wit so dead

To brave the storm with undraped head?
Or of what man among our band

Doth rain no foolish hat demand?
Each fellow here at thunder clap

Invests his head with grotesque cap

And runs to join the mad cap craze.

Amid a frightful chapeau maze

Top hats, Frosh hats, panama straw hats
Golf caps, skull caps, ball caps, and rain hats
Sun hats, helmets, flat-tops, and waste cans
Join sombreros, fezzes, and turbans

Paper hats, felt hats, fur and straw

It’s raining vile bonnets . . . . oh so.

Alumnus for Change
In A.B. Requirements
For Liberal Arts Degree

Dear Jim:

I would like to add my endorse-
ment to the reform proposed by
two writers on your editorial page
of the October 19 issue.

Franklin and Phil did good jobs
is presenting the inadequacy of a
BS. degree awarded for comple-
tion of a strict liberal arts course

—John B. Trotti

of study.

The distinction between Science
and Arts at Davidson is archaic
and subject to ridicule at other
colleges. Here at Columbia we
have no Bachelor of Science de-
gree for all must take complete
liberal arts programs, except engi-
neers who are segregated in a dif-
ferent school.

Please compliment Phil and
Frank for their editorials. Also
1 thought this issue of the David-
sonian, so far as the editorial page
is concerned, was greatly improv-
ed over the past two issues.

Tom's column can be very valu-
able.

I have been passing these on
to Henry Brockman too.

Thorn in the Flesh
Worth Two on Bush

Dear Sir:

What's with these hot house
brier patches that have appeared
this week? Has Davidson College

us and it will demand the time and
effort of each American, not be-
cause he is a Democrat or a Re-
publican; but because he is an
American first and last.

The thought of unity was un-
heard of by both the Republicans
and the Democrats, for the United
States was experiencing an. election
campaign, which made the two
parties enemies of ‘each other at
this time but now the
people have spoken. .

We have decided in favor of
Mr. Eisenhower’s version of peace
and prosperity to the vision of a
“new America” Stevenson futilely
unfurled before the voters.

But this wasn't the only issue
in which the people decided up-
on; instead we voiced our opinion
on many other issues that are
more important and were brought
out more emphatically during the
campaign.

It is my opinion that the Demo-
crats failed because they resorted
to attacking the President from
the start of the campaigning rather
than enlighting the voter on what
their party would do to correct
the “mistakes of the Republican
administration”. The platform fail-
ed in its effort, for the platforms
of the two parties did not differ
that much.

The so called issues which were
tossed back and forth would prob-
ably help to pinpoint the actual
reasons for the peoples’ voting as
they did:

Peace and Prosperity: There is
no doubt that this helped the Re-.
publican Party immensely, for the
U. S. isn’t involved in a shooting
war and there is less unemploy-
ment than there has been in years,
most of the populace has plenty
of food on the table, and the dol-
lar is still stable.

The Democrats, on the other
hand, have tried to take credit
for the prosperity which they
argued is a carry over from the
previots Democratic administra-

(A safe place to send your son)
gone berserk?

In the past, falling from the re-
taining wall or battling the camou-
flaged fences has been bad enough.
But now think of the additional
terror a dark night or a dance
weekend holds, MOAN!

Perhaps the powers to be at
D.C. (Note pentameter) have some-
thing else in mind.

Picture the future. Davidson
gentlemen surrounded on every
walk by living hypodermic need-
les. Thus will our virgin grass and
all of its corresponding grandeur
be saved for posterity.

HELP KEEP DAVIDSON
FREE. LOOK THESE PER-
PETRATORS OF CONFORM.
ITY RIGHT IN THE STAMEN
AND PRESS ONWARD!

Yours Truly,
Pierced

stabilized until the Republicans
came into office in 1952.

Farm Problem: ihe Democrats
were campaigning for 100% parity
whereas the Republicans cam-
paigned for inflexible supports at
a 905 parity. The Republicans
felt that the problem lay with the
great surpluses which we held on
hand; therefore, the soil bank pro-
gram was their answer to ridding
the country of these surpluses.

It is true that no definite effect
of this program has been felt thus
far, but the administration sup-
ported this program for its long
run advantages, This the farmer
approved whole heartedly.

Draft: an invention of the Demo-
cratic clique as a desperate effort
to slow down Ike's gaining sup-
porters. The world situation also
helped to cool the voters toward
accepting Stevenson’s proposal to
discontinue the draft.

Mr. Stevenson wasn’t even able
to provide a plan which would
prove his calling the draft as be-
ing “unecessary”. Again the voters
chose security over making a re-
treat in our defense efforts.

Ending H-Bomb Tests: Even Mr.
Truman called Mr. Stevenson’s
hand when he proposed to end the
detonation of nuclear bombs. The
voters shouldn’t have been ex-
pected to accept this proposal as
being in the best interest of the
U. S., especially since we had no
guarantee that an enemy power
wouldn’t drop that initial bomb on
the U. S., after we discontinued
our tests.

Mr. Eisenhower felt, as did most
Americans, that the H-bomb was
a deterrent to aggression, and that
it was the.best interest of the U. S.
if the tests were continued... ..
Mr. Ex-President Truman also
agreed.

The G.0.P. Is The Rich Man's
Party: again the Democrats failed
to gain politically from such an
assertion which has plagued the
Republican party down through
the years.

When the Federal Reserve Board
tightened money supplies to slow
down inflationary tendencies and
make the ‘dollar more stable, the
Democrats shouted that the Re-
publicans were instead helping
only their banker friends by hik-
ing the interest rates. They com-
pletely ignored the fact that the
board is an independent agency
and not a department over which
the administration exercises di-
rect control. But the average man,
also, failed to be sucked in by
such assertions.

Perhaps many feel as I do; that
there actually weren't too many
issues available for the Democrats,
so they did the next best thing—
manufactured the issues as they
saw fit; and they suffered the con-
sequences as a result.
