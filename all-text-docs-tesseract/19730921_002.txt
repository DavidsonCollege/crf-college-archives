Staff Writer

The Davidson College Union
has several projects that should
add a new dimension to the
Davidson social scene. These
range from a big show for
Homecoming to a renovated
bar in the basement of the
Union.

College Union President Joe
Earle stated, ‘‘We have a lot of
good ideas for Homecoming,
but there are still some con-
tracts to be settled.’’ He added
that one of the acts would be
“The Proposition”, a comedy
team similar to “The Ace
Trucking Company’’, but with
more experience.

Earle stated that the
Homecoming concert would be

that Ellen Kearney is per-

bar. Earle stated that ‘‘the bar

altered in the interest of
providing the students a place
for Rest and Relaxation."

Chairman of the Union Bar
Lenny Vincent said that the bar
