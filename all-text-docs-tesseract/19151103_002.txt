FACTS. of its size, and will give Davidson some

work to win from them. This is.the
first time the two colleges will meet. Last
vear the two teams were scheduled to
play, but Furman was forced to cancel.

A full statement is given elsewhere in
this issue regarding the cancellation of
the game with South Carolina, We ask
the reader to carcfully weigh these facts
and then render a decision as to where
the blame for the cancellatton should be
placed.

Simnly remember that for seventeen
years Davidson has played South Caro
lina in foot ball, and twice has South
Carolina been victorious. There is every
reason to believe that the game this year
would have only added another victory
to the now already long chain.

Much more in the way of comment
could be given, but mere words are many
times anly substitutes for facts. We
prefer to give the facts and allow the
reader to come to an impartial decision.

CHAPMAN-ALEXANDER
MEETINGS A’ ASHEVILLE

From all reports the Chapman-Alex-
ander meetings at Asheville have been
juste as successful there as they were here
October 12, 13 and 14 of the last month.
When the meetings began it was thought
that the seating capacity of five thousand
would be sufficient to accommodate the
crowds, but at every meeting the seats
are filled, every available piece of stand-
ing room taken, and still the people are
being turned away by hundreds.

Dr. Chapman has been preaching pow-
erful and searching sermons, and the
ocople have responded wonderfully, Mr.
Alexander has charge of the — singing.
Two of the favorite songs are “The
Ivory Palaces,” written and composed
bv Mr, Barraclough, and “He Wants a
Poor Sinner Like Me.”

It is with pleasure that the Davidson
men learn that Mr. Alexander, who was
slighly ill for several days after leaving
here, is again able to take charge of the
singing.

Clemson—An_ ecffart is now being
made to re-establish the honor system at
