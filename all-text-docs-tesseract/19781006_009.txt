With a decisive score of 20-38
the women’s cross country team
overwhelmed Lynchburg in the
5000 meter race held here last
Saturday. Despite the. absence
of top runner Paula Kadison,
Davidson still captured five of
the top seven places.
Susan Davidson took top

honors by winning the college
division with a record-setting

time of 20:10. After sprinting’

into the finishing chute David-

injury with which she has been
recently plagued.

‘*I guess psychologically I
wasn’t aware of the pain during

the race,’’ commented David-
son.
Although Lynchburg man-

aged a second place finisher,
Davidson followed with a solid

“block: of three runners. Elize-°

beth Dean completed the course
in 21:46 while close on her heels
Sarah Todd captured fourth
with a time of 21:51 and Nancy

Wright finished fifth in 22:29.
Merideth Durden, running

her first race for the Wildcats,

displayed exceptional effort by

placing seventh, overall and

rounding out the top five scor-

ers for Davidson.’

Lisa Shingler, Susan Roberts
and Beth DuBose ‘finished
ninth, eleventh and twelfth
respectively, placing. all ‘eight
members of the Davidson team
ahead of the fifth scorer for
Lynchburg.

As Davidson observed, ‘‘I
thought -we were running as a
team. Before (in the Stoné’
Mountain road race two weeks
ago) it seemed like every man
for himself, but here there was a
very cohesive feeling among the
team.”

Other than the two rival
college teams, several high
school runners also competed in
the race. Senior Alison Butter-
worth from Myers’ Park: High
School exhibited extraordinary
talent by covering the course in
a time of 19:24, thereby winning

_the overall meet.

Unfortunately, she has al-

ready ‘planned to ‘continue her
career in Colorado and will not

As Koller analyzed, ‘“‘We’ve
got an outside chance at Geor-

depth we didn’t have before

The third and final meet will
be held at Wake Forest on
October 14, and both Wake
Forest and Georgia State will
compete against Davidson.

.Concerning this first year for

remarked, ‘‘We’ve established a

The Davidson College Wild-

cats go into this-week’s game.

against Randolph-Macon ad-
mittedly disappointed. The
Cats wanted to win the Home-
coming game last weekend be-
fore a crowd of over 4,500 and

- made a tremendous effort to do

just that. A few inches and a
few seconds made the differ-
ence.

The Cats went into the fourth
quarter trailing by seven points
to the Bucknell Bisons. Follow-
ing a punt midway in the final
period, the Cats found them-
selves stuck in a-hole at their
own six yard line.

From there, the Wildcats
started what ‘“‘could’” have been
one of the most. important
drives in recent Davia: Col-

“feck Ad this dee Ue ea

the 94 yards for the score in 16

time-consuming Plays. The six
- points made. the score 21-20
with only minutes remaining.

Davidson decided to go for
the two-point conversion for the
win if, indeed, there was a
decision to be made at all.
Rhyne’s pass to Alvin Atkinson
standing open in the left flats
fell short, and Davidson's point
total fell short, too.

The Wildcats were not fin-
ished with the comeback effort,
however. The defense charged
onto the field following the
kickoff and held Bucknell for
three downs and forced the
Bisons to kick.

The Cats took the ball at their
own 41 and marched toward
victory once again. The Bisons
made the Cats work for the
import..nt yardage. The Cats
were forced into a fourth-and-10
at one point in that drive, but
they continued to move all the

way to the eight yard line with

only 12 ticks left on the clock.
The stage was set for fresh-
man Mike Bass to come onto
the field and boot the ball
through the uprights for the
field goal and, more import-
_anthy;, the win.

disappeared from the clock.
Wildcat Coach Ed Farrell

commented, “We have & let of..

confidence in our kicking game.
The kid whaled the daylights
out of it—it went out of the
stadium, it must have gone 50
~ yards,”

Even the disappokatssdnt of
losing could not cover up, the

effort of the Wildcat team.

Farrell said,-“I think playing
back-to-back games like we
have against Wofford and
Bucknell improves confidence.
We played two tough teams
close and we feel we should have
won both. The win over ‘Wof-
ford (31-27 the previous week-
end) was a good one for us, We
had some opportunities against
Bucknell but didn’t take advan-
tage of them.”’ ;

Page Walley. a senior full-
back for the Wildcats, can
break into the record books next
week in Ashland, Va., if he
rushes for 95 yards. Hé now has
1,263 yards rushing for three
seasons and is 95 yards shy of

both teams. Davidson defeated

Washington and Lee 34.7 for

the Cats first win of the season,

and Randolph-Macon won with

a 28-14 score.

Davidson racked up a 49-7
victory last year at Richardson
Field after fighting to a 0-0 tie
in the first meeting of these two
teams in 1976.

Davidson used a passing
offense in Saturday’s game. The
game plan was to attack the
Bison secondary. The Cats
picked up 230 yards through the
air; Gifford Piercy was the
leading receiver with seven
receptions for 117 yards. Rhyne
was 16-32-2 for the afternoon in
the passing department for all
of the 230 yards.

The Wildcats also rushed 48
times for 157 yards.

Davidson outgained Bucknell
by over 100 yards and had 20
first downs to the Bisons’ 12.
The score, however, is the
statistic that mattered whan ee
game was over.

Bucknell Coach Bob Curtis
was impressed by Davidson. He
said, ‘‘Davidson’s much im-
proved (from the 1977 game
which Bucknell won 44-12).
They've got kids who can run, it
was Homecoming and they
deserved to win; we didn’t. We
just had enough points. We got.
