The dedication next week of the John R. Cunning-
ham Fine Arts Center climaxes the building phase of
Davidson's current ten-year building program, which
began in 1957.

The dedication is set for Thursday, with registration
from 9 to 10 a.m. for off-campus guests, including alumni
leaders and members of the drama, music, and art de-
partments from colleges and universities throughout the
area.

CUNNINGHAM

The building is named for Dr. John R. Cunningham,
president emeritus of Davidson, who led the school from
1941 through 1957 and is now president of the Presby-
terian Foundation. In his 16 years as president, Cunning-
ham guided the college to progress with a strong program
during the college’s ten-year plan.

The dedication service will take place at 10:20 in
the Fine Arts Quadrangle. Dr. John A. Redhead, minister
of the First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro, will give
the invocation, after which the Male Chorus ~will sing,
and distinguished guests, including Dr. Cunningham and
Charles A. Dana, a major contributor, will be recognized.
Dana will be the guest of President and Mrs. D. Grier
Martin Wednesday and Thursday.

LITANY

President Martin and Dr. J. McDowell Richards,
president of Columbia Theological Seminary, will lead
the audience in a dedicatory litany, especially prepared
by Dr. George Staples, college chaplain. Dr. Cunningham
will give the benediction.

Mascot Gets Name--
Peter Ney Lives Qn!

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Our wildeat is not longer nameless! What is more, |
he has a French name.

From the historical back-
ground suggestion by Dr. Chal-
mers Davidson, the DAVIDSON-
IAN’s committee selected the
mascot’s official name: “The
Marshal, Peter Stuart Ney JI.”
The French nickname for Ney—
“The Bravest of the Brave’—
also applies to our cat.

The committee, composed of
the editors of THE DAVIDSON.
1AN, President 0. Grier Mar-
tin, and Head Cheerleader Joe
| Martin, narrowed the entries
‘aown to two. A submission of
‘Felix V was the other entry
that vied for the position of
winner.

Had that name won, the wild-

cat would have been the only:

‘he arrived in a cognac case.

‘the pep rally last Thursday, and

“The Marshal” and the nick-
namie associated with Ney were
the key factors that led the com-
mittee to decide as it did. His
name wil! probably be shortened !
to “The Marshal” or just “Pete” |
in common reference.

The name on the cat’s cage!
will feature “The Marshal,’
with “Peter Stuart Ney, {1% |

ably be added the apt term “The
