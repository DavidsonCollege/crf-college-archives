Samuel H. Bell, Daughter

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Editor

In 1936, Davidson College received a letter from one
of its two oldest alumni saying, “I cannot encourage you
to think that I shall ever contribute to the Alumni :
At Thursday’s meeting of the Board of Trustees, Presi-
dent D, Grier Martin announced the largest bequest in
the history of the college from the family of this same

man, Samuel Henry Bell.

The story of how $835,000
came to Davids n makes what
President Martin called “one of
the most unusual and appealing
stories of loyalty and generosi-
ty ever told in the history of
higher education in America.”

Dr. Bell was a_ native of
Rocky Point in Hanover County,

N. C. He entered Davidson in
1867 and. graduated with the
class of ‘70. After. theological
training at Columbia Seminary

Fate played one of its many

tricks here, for despite the de-

after World War Il, the Bells
managed to salvage most of
| the bequest and additional
larger investments. Invested
in stocks, the capital appre-
ciated greatly during the re-
mainder of Mrs. Mitchell’s
life.

Although he retired from ac-
tive duty shortly after 1912, Bell
felt the need to re-enter the
service with the U.S. entry into
World War I. He petitioned
Senator Lee S. Overman of
North Carolina and won an ap-
pointment at Fort Oglethorpe,
Georgia. A letter from James
Sprunt, of the Wilmington Cot-
ton Sprunts, dated May 1, 1918,
congratulates Bell on “your
meritorious record and your call
by the Surgeon General of the
Army to active duty.”

During his retirement until
his death in 1942, Bell continued
to be a loyal son of Davidson
and his loyalty was proved long
before it was known that he had
left such an endowment to the
college. In President Martin's
report to the trustees, he stated
this indirectly when he said
that “coupled with a feeling of
deepest gratitude to that per-
son is a sense of frustration
which comes from having no
one to whom cn expression of
appreciation is appropriate.”

Mrs. Hamilton has steadily
grown in her work from an
academic approach to one of
pure abstraction. She has learn-
ed and grown from each exper-
ience to the next. The area in
between these two “extremes,”
which many people would call
abstract but which is more re-
alistic than the academic or the
pure abstraction, has provided
the approach for most of her
work.

in these works can be seen
a whole world of space and
relationships. In a picture of
Venice she can give the sense
of the buildings and the sky
merging, of the canals flowing
through the buildings, of the
humor of the gondola shapes
which a peephole academic
picture could not possibly cap-
ture.

In a house and trees she can
give the mixture of leaves in
the sky, the inviting rooms to
be explored, the feeling that one
can enter and walk around the
house. In a town in the Alps
she explores the dialogue of sky
and streets, their complements
of each other. Then she explores
the far-reaching effect of the
Alps.

In her “Table on the Terrace,
which has an affinity to Matis-
se, may be seen the touch of
humor she can give to her pur-

ture, 1S cuteness)

Having worked with the
idea of pure abstraction for
15 years, Mrs. Hamilton is
thinking of pursuing this di-
rection now—although she
cannot be sure how much
more she will do in this vein.
Unlike her other work, which
comes largely from objects
and landscapes, these works
have all thus far been taken
from people.

Her abstract with a blue and a

red shape was developed with
the red shape being the model's
steol and the rest of the canvas
working with it. There is a
complex’ movement around the
blue subject, light moving to

dark which sets the blue in mo-
tion and provides a picture full
of atmosphere and deep dimen-
sion.

Many of the things Mrs.
Hamilton says of paintings are
similar to what James Bum.
gardner said. This is under-
standable—they have studied
