Notre Dame Abandons Celibacy

The all-male Catholic-supported University of
Notre Dame has decided to go coeducational. Notre
Dame’ and the administration of St. Mary’s College, a
Catholic college for women, have agreed to develop
a 3-to-1 ratio of male to female students.

The decision was announced Monday by the Rev.
Theodore H. Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame,
and Monsignor John J. McGarth, president of St.
Mary’s. The trustees of both institutions have approv
ed the coeducation plan to give the two campuses “an
increasingly coeducational character.”

The process will begin in September, when 245
freshmen from each school will share four required
liberal arts courses at both campuses.

Belmont Abbey Expels Seven Protesters

Seven black students at Belmont Abbey College
who last week took over the science building have
been expelled from the college.

The expulsion by the college’s disciplinary com-
mittee may be appealed to the school’s president, who
said after the action that he would have the “good
proposals” by the group studied by the college.

An earlier statement by the president indicated
that Belmont Abbey did not have the funds necessary
to implement the student demands.

Temple Coeds Join Cadet Corps

Eight coeds at Temple University are presently
taking part in the ROTC program there.

The girls joined up when the university made its
annual announcement that participating in the vol-
untary program would be considered a substitute
for required physical education.

The coeds will not receive ROTC commissions
when they graduate, but they do follow the normal
curriculum of the cadets, including drill.

Legislators Attack Obscenity

A crisis has sprung up at the University of New
Mexico over the use in an English class of a poem
which state legislators termed obscene.

The legislators demanded that the teaching assist-
ant who used the poem be replaced, and the university
president suspended him pending investigation of the

circumstances.

The president has also suspended the chairman
of the English department and the head of freshman
English instruction for their refusal to fire the instruc-
tor:in whose class the poem was discussed.

In the English department at UNM other profes-
sors and teaching assistants responded by distributing
the poem to their classes so that they also would be
implicated. Other faculty members and graduate as-
sistants’ met and demanded that the president. rein-
state the instructors and faculty members involved.

A student group also demanded of the president
that he defend the academic freedom of the college
or else resign the presidency.

The ‘poem involved was “Love Lust Poem” by
Lenmore Kandel. One state senator characterized it
as “the most filthy stuff I’ve ever read,” and threaten-
ed to cut the university’s appropriations unti) the
administration promised “to clean up the campus.”

“The university has to risk
its life to save itself,’ he
said. ‘‘students don’t want
to wait for commencement
to commence. They want to
commence now.”

Two outside opinions were
picked up also from a pair
of men closely assoclated
with Guilford College. Jay
Longacre and Bruce Stewart

clear ideas of the possibill-

Chemistry
Honorary
Taps 25

Gamma Sigma Epsilon, na-
tional honorary chemical
fraternity, inducted 25 new
members and an honorary
faculty member at its meet-
ing last Monday.

Founded at Davidson on
1919, Gamma Sigma Epsilon
recognizes students who are
interested in chemistry and
have met the academic re-
quirements for admission.

Dr. John N. Burnett, As-
sistant Professor of Chemis-
try, delivered a lecture to
the group after the initiation
ceremony.

Elected to the fraternity
were Burnett as an honorary
faculty member and Sterling
Abernathy, Edward Bartle,
William Bowen, Jack Crum-
bley, Mac Davis Paul Gar-

ties and priorities in admis-
sion and experimentation.

Stewart, former admissions
head of Guilford, warned the
conference about. the admis-
sion of Negroes and the de-
mands on the college which
such admission produces. He
noted that it can work well,
saying ‘“‘you've got to turn
the whole place upside down
to do it.”

Stewart made it explicity
clear that concessions must
be made; and illustrated his
point with the success of the
Guilford administration in
coping with the problem.

“If Davidson wants black
students." he said, “it can
get them.”

Longacre. who is at Guil-
ford for a New York fund-
raising corporation, describ-
ed methods for financing
such programs as the experi-
mental college and career
studies programs.

Most colorful in his view
of alumni from the stand-
point of a fund-raiser, he
said, “if one’s education is
only worth $15 or $20 a year,
then something is wrong.”
and noted a moral and legi-
timate right for a college to
ask for more funds for such
programs.

Representing the Southern
Educational Board in -Atlan-
ta, Bill Sigmon told the group
that the ‘‘soul’’ spirit is mis-
sing in the Davidson educa-
tion.

He spoke of the changing
criteria of performance in the
American cotleges, s¢_ing
that the old verbal inteliec-
tual Ideats of more thinking
than acting which charac-
terize Davidson are giving
way to the new idea of
emotion over ideas, of things
rather than symbols.

He challenge the school
to expose its \iberal arts
idea to the “great issues,”

Lively Anti-War Satire

A REVIEW

By DICK ANDERSON
Associate Editor

“Oh What'a Lovely War” is
a preachy satire on the First
World War. And like most
works in which the author
tries to get across a, moral-
istic point. it’ is extraordi-
narily long-winded.

And that is about all one
can find to criticize in the
Davidson College Drama De-
partment’s production.

Study
Of Pay
Goes On

By BILL SHERWOOD
Staff Writer

The campaign to effect an
increase 11 the salaries of
fraternity cooks is progress-
ing.

More complete figures than
those which only indicate the
cash take-home pay of the
cooks are being obtained and
analyzed, said Randy Phil-
lips, one of the organizers
of the campaign.

These figures will enabic
Phillips and Robert Pyeatt,
who first became cognizant
of the salary situation of the
cooks, to determine to a
fairly accurate extent the
real income, or total benefits,
that the cooks receive.

“It is evident from the fig-
ures already available that
the salaries are indeed in-
adequate,’ Pyeatt said.

When the degree of this
inadequacy is determined.
those concerned will try to
persuade each of the fratern-
ities to increase the pay of
the. cooks, he said. If the
fraternities fail to respond,
Pyeatt indicated that some
other strategy may be tried.

When the complete figures
are available, the YMCA
Cabinet is to vote on the
issue, deciding whether or
not. to support and perhaps
lend assistance to the cam
paign. said Pyeatt.

justice, war and militarism.”
Dr. T. A. Williams posed
one of the most provocative
statements in response ‘to
Sigmon’s challenge, saying
that credit must be given
for such experiments in
careers and outside work.

“You can’t separate the
personal focus and the aca-
demic focus,’ Willlams sald.
“The personal things are not
the things that lead you to
graduation, and this is de-
moralizing.”

The entire. retreat was en
lightening and exciting, but
a great deal of the excitc-
ment will be lost in the writ-
ing of the reports.

The value came in that
students such as_ Richard
Cowart and Les Brown, and
faculty and administrators
could finally get together in
one place to get their ideas
opened.

The overall idea gained
from the conference was that
the main obstacles of credits
and costs could be worked
out, and excitement of the
posibilities generated that
weekend at least partially re-
main to spawn new ideas and
new excitement.

sectors appear in consistent
roles. Particularly impressive
among these is Tim Gailey
as the stuffed shirt British
commander, Sir Douglas
Haig. whose wildly over.ap
timistic pronouncements con
trast vividly with the silly
black fluffs on the front of

The casting is consistently
excellent. Peter Lutken has
the role of the host of the
“war games’” which are play

and he is appropriately en
thusiastic.

One of the most effective
techniques in the play. is the
use of the film projector to
throw pictures, posters, cas-
ualty reports and other mes
sages on the screen that is
the sole backdrop to the
action.

Some of the skits are extra-
ordinarily funny: sume of the
others. unfortunately are not.
One. of the best is a train-
ing scene with Tony Orsbon
as a gung-ho drill sergeant
trying to teach bayonet drill

unsure whether the proposals
would be presented formally
to this committee, but added
that he felt it appropriate for
the. SLC to review. a matter
so important in student life.

Howéver, Spencer said last
week thal the report had
been sent to the SLC for
recommendations.

Burts said that should cur
few regulations remain in ef
fect. temporary suspensions
such as those granted for
Midwinter and Spring Frolics

tinue in the future.

‘There are student mem

rules,"’ Burts added.
