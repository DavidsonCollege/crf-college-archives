A glimpse at Davidson College 1999-2000?

Dober, Lidsky, Craig and Associates reveal their proposal

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

After studying the campus for two

years, the firm Dober, Lidsky, Craig and
Associates have compiled a ten year
plan for Davidson’s future growth.
*Charles Craig, one of the firm’s part-
ners, presented the plan to the college
community last Wednesday and Thurs-
day. The proposal outlines a plan for
meeting the needs of the campus by
planning new buildings, renovating
older ones and reconstructing traffic
patterns.

Craig estimated the cost of construc-
tion at a conservative $32 million. He
said that this number did not cover fur-
nishing or equipment costs. President
John Kuykendall said that Davidson’s
present $150 million campaign drive
sets aside $42 million to cover select
projects. Neither he nor Craig would
commenton the cost of the Dober report
itself.

The reportcalls for the constructionof
a “néw.-campus”: facing Main: street
between Griffith and Depot streets. This
area would provide a definite entrance
to the college, as well as increase the
overall size of the campus. The college
would have specifically labelled north,

south, east and west gates, with the
main gate located on Griffith street.
Plans also include a 100-space parking
lot along Jackson street.

Visitors would be welcomed to cam-
pus by anart building, a music building
and anadministration building. Money
for the art building has been included in
the Davidson campaign. Construction
on the building will begin withina year.

The music building planned for the
comer of Griffithand Main streetsisnot
included in the campaign. William
Lawing, associate professor of music,
estimated that it will be between 12 and
15 years before that facility is built. The
administration building is sche-duled
to be built even further in the future.

Davidson college, however, does not
ownall of the land included in plans for
the new campus. Dr. Donald Copeland
owns the 100 x 300 feet around the
Copeland house and says he does not
intend to sell the land.

NCNB has sponsored its
second annual Dean Rusk
Conference on International
Affairs. This year’s program,
titled “Reform or Revolution:
Gorbachev’s Soviet Union,”
opened Tuesday with an
address by Alexander Dallin,
a 1989 Phi Beta Kappa Visiting
Scholar from Stanford Uni-
versity.

"Itis a fascinating and diffi-
cult time to be observing the |
Soviet Union," said Dallin. He
characterized the changes in
the U.S.S.R. as an increasing
failure and collapse of institu-

tions and a growing focus on

individuals.
The conference will con-
clude Thursday morning. See
