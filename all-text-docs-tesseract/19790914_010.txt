Wildcat gridders proclaim: We know what we can n do

A convincing win by a team
in its opening game

engenders terrific confidence
among its fans. However, in
view of Davidson's past unpre-
dictable track record, why
would anyone believe that this
year is any different, regardless
of their 35-7 drubbing of Cata-
wha last weekend.
MENTAL PREPARATION

Before proceeding to shed
some light on why this season's
won-lost record could be the
best ever in Davidson History
with tangible evidence, it is
perhaps important to dwell
initially on the intangible fac-
tors which supplement a team’s
physical tools—namely, atti-
tude and confidence.

Captain Phillip Gilbert, a
four-year starter at free safety,
notes that this year’s team
seems ‘‘more self-confident*‘
than in other years. He attri-
butes a good deal of the
increased self-assurance to the
fact that ‘with more upper-
classmen playing, we all know

each other's moves better and

are more mature." Captain
Craig Pyles, a four-year starter
at running back, acknowledges
the improved mental attitude of
this year’s squad by saying,
“Nobody has any doubts we can
be a good team. We have a
feeling of knowing what we can
do.”

Captain ‘Mike Sheridan, in his
fifth season with the Wildcats
as defensive lineman, reflected
on the improved aspects of the
football program. “My fresh-
man year the player attrition
rate was unbelievable. Now, we
have a higher retention of
players who believe in the
program and Coach Farrell's
brand of football.”

The squad’s altered mental
framework was discernible be-
fore this season even started;
the team. enthusiastically und-
erwent an intensive off-season
preparation to improve the criti-
cal football skill areas of agility,
speed, and strength. It seems to
have paid high dividends alrea-
dy for the Cats. Seridan
ovserved, ‘‘The coaches have
asked more, and we have given
more. We’ve gotten stronger
and quicker due to off-season
work.”

The perserverance and dedic-
ation of the players even progre-
ssed during the early summet
months when the players were
forced to design discipline work-
outs on their own. Sheridan
noted,*‘even from last year,
we've come back to camp in
better shape. We've been able
to work more on dur football
skills than getting into shape.“
Pyles echoed the sentiments. of
his teammate,‘ Although the
atmosphere was lively during
camp, it hes been a lot of work.
Everybody’s waiting for it to
pay off.”

Coach Ed Farrell, now in his
sixth year at the coaching helm,
strongly believes only two fact-
ors can keep the Cats from a

very good season, one being an
unusual amount of injuries.

However, Farrell added that the
depth situation, always a prob-
lem at Davidson, is better this
year than in the past. The
second factor Farrell noted as
damaging to a successful record
was the “problem of confi-
dence— believing in yourself.
Living with a losing tradition i,
tough on the players. Success i:
the only way to gain the needed
confidence.”’ Therefore, to help.
remedy this problem, the team
has cultivaated several ingredi-
ents considered essential! for
bolstering football confidence—
running, speed and physical
strength through hard work in «
the off season.
OFFENSE

Coach Farrell’s introduction
of the Wing-T’offense six years
ago came after an era of

than we've ever been before and
tis important to have this

Offensive line coach Bob E-
stock was please with the
efforts of his line against Cat-
awba, but made it clear, “‘We
can’t be satisfied with what
we've done. We've got to im-
prove upon it."In listening _ to
Estock’s claim about the i impor: .
tancé of the offensive line, it is
easy to see why he strives for
_ perfection from his players. He
contends, “If the line ¢an win
the line of sctimmage, then it
can determine the. outcome of a
football game.”

Davidson is fortunate to pos-
sess a group of extremely
talented and hard-working ath-
letes in the running back posi-
tions. In fact, this may be the

Coach Jim Colbert, the offen-
sive coordinator, feels the team
has “got to get the ball to him
as much as possible.” _

At quarterback, senior Al
Rhyne and sophomore Brian
Whitmore will be battling it out
” for the number-one berth. Sher-

idan pointed out the positive -

stabilizing influence of having
“two healthy and capable quar-
ter-backs that are capable of
leading a team.’’ However,
since only one quarterback can
start, Whitmire will get the nod
this weekend owing to his
splendid performance against
Catawba. Yet, Farrell affirms,
“the quarterback situation has
not changed. One or the other

cks at Davidson. It was not
unusual for forty or more passes
to be attempted in one game.
Although exciting to watch,
this free-lance offense proved
very unfruitful. In contrast, the
Wing-T offense takes on a very
conservative appearance. Those
who have endured the trial
‘period of the Wing-T finally
seem to have been rewarded.
This result comes as no surprise
to Farrell who insists that a
successful football team must
“have a balanced offense.”” He
adds,"‘This requires a good
inside and outside running ga-
me andd the ability to throw the
football.”

Perhaps the biggest question
mark with the offense lies with
the offensive Hine, which is
judged to be somewhat small by
most college standards. Farrell
acknowledges this apparent ph-
ysical deficiency, but insists
“the lineman can make up size
with blocking technique.’’ Py-
les, too, was quick to emphasi-
ze,'since the line does a lot of
trapping, quickness is more
important than size.”

Farrell concluded his effusive
praise of. his offensive line,
which included seniors Dave
Donaldson and Matt Auker and
juniors Patrick Pope, Danny
Klinar and Dave Nichols, by
praising their tremendous overll
talents. “‘We’re better athletes

game. Farrell, although noting
a slight problem with their
outside speed, is quite confident
with the halfback situation.
‘We know about our halfbacks.
They’re exceptional blockers as
well as good runners.” Led by
powerful senior Craig Pyles and
the deceptive slashing style of
junior Alvin Atkinson, the
backfield position appears very
solid, especially when one con-
siders the awesome talent at the
fullback position in sophomores
Ray Sinclair and Aaron Rollins.
It is obvious from his comments
that Farrell is very high on his
two fallbacks.

“Sinclair has great’ balance
and he may have the best speed
in the back field. Aaron has
played very well, but we were
not surprised. We were aware of
his potential. We knew going
into the Catawba game that’ we
had two fullbacks willing to
play. It gives us a great
dimension now that we have
two people we know-we can win
with,” Farrell said. ‘

The receiving corps presents
another formidable area for
opponents to defense. Led by
premier junior wide receiver
Gifford Piercy and sure-handed
tight-ends Tom Trahey and
James Jones, who are presently
rotating at their position, the
Cat quarterbacks are in an
envieable position whenever

done. I have total confidence in
both people.”

Colbert recognizes the merits
of having two fine throwing
quarterbacks available for ac-
tion, but expresses his desire.
“That someone would just take

Acharge. At this point Brian is
number one. We're not alterna-
ting quarterbacks.”
DEFENSE

On defense, the tedm has a
large number of returning vet-
erans, a fact which greatly
pleases Coach Farrell and fur-
ther augments player confi-
dence. Safety Gilbert admitted,
“It takes time for the secondary
and the defense to work toge-
ther—experience is the key.
Middle guard Sheridan expres-
ses these same feelings.
“Things started coming toge-
ther in the Lafayette game at
the end of last season. Hopeful-
ly, we can use that as an
example. We lost good players
to graduation, but there are
quality players ready to step
in.”

Farrell too expects this
team’s defense to be very good.
and with good reason, as the
team and the coaches have
learned from last year's mis-
takes. “Defense was the epi-
tome of our frustrations last
year. We played tentatively and
with no confidence. This year
we emphasized team defense

s

we've reduced the keys. We
may have become ‘too jdrill
conscious last year. Hopefully,
by emphasizing more playing
instead of just drilling, natural
instinct and playing talent will
be the key,”’ he said.

The Cats will be looking for
strong inside play from Sheri-
dan, senior Dylan Faircloth,
and ever-improving junior
Steve Lowe, At the ends will be
the able duo of senior Barry
Cannon and Guy Harbert. Juni-
or Pat Sheridan is injured but
should be returning to action
shortly. At the linebacker posi-
tion, the Cats seem to have a
surplus of gifted athletes. With
senior Jim Lividatis and Greg
Hammons, junior Atmire Bail-
ey, Sophomore starter James
McCtain, and freshman sensa-
tion Sammy Huntley all ready
for action, the linebacker posi-
tion appears sound.

In the secondary, seniors
Gilbert and hard-hitting John
Fetcho will be paired with the
talented junior cornerback
Kevin Hannah and speedy -
sophomore Andre Kennebrew,
who has stopped in to take the
place of an injured Virgil Fludd.

The specialty and kicking —
teams will also provide a big
plus for the Wildcats. Sopho-
more kicker Wayne Paymer,
labelled a ‘‘pro-prospect by
Farrell, silt handle all placekick-
ing and punting chores.

The specialty teams.may also
provide some excitement as
their punting-an kicking cover-
age demonstrated this past
Saturday. Léd by Captain
Mitch Shirley, whom Sheridan
extols as ‘doing a good job of
firing his squad up,” the spe-
cialty team is replete with a
group of scrappy, hard-nosed
players who will perform their
duties quite well. According to
Sheridan, the team takes a good
deal of pride in the performance
of this unit.

All in all, Farrell seems quite
optimistic about this season
and understandably so. ‘Every
year the attitude gets better
and the players are-willing to do
more,” Farrell said, “I think I
detect an appreciable increase in
emotion and enthusiasm. The
players are determined to do-
what needs to be-done. I can’t
think of anything more to ask of
them until the kickoffs. We
have a good schedule. It is both
realistic and challenging.”’
Pyles concurred, saying, ‘‘the
schedule is tough enough to get
into the divisions 1-AA playoffs
should the team play: up to its
potential.”

However, both players and
coaches wisely seemed a little
cautious with forecasting such
lofty goals for the Cats. At
present, the team has agreed to
focus on limited objectives—
that is, taking each game one at
a time—so that all energies can
be directed to what the team
has to do right now.

If the team can do this
successfully, Farrell believes, it
is “potentially a good football
team. If we can just jell early
and build our confidence, we
won't be easy to beat.
