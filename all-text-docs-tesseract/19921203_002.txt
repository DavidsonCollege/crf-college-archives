Alcohol Enforcement Co

mmittee Clarifies

Patterson Court Houses' Responsibilities |

By Tom Price

This past Monday the Alco-
hol Enforcement Committee senta
memorandum to Patterson Court
houses clarifying the houses’ roles
in enforcing the College’s new al-
cohol policy.

The issue arose after the Kappa
Alpha-Order was charged with an
alcohol violation for failing to co-
operate with alcohol monitors in
their effort toremove alcohol from
the house after the 2:00 a.m. dead-
line on a weekend night. Repre-
sentatives of the KA house said in

their defense that they believed it
was the sole responsibility of the
monitors to make sure all alcohol
was removed.

In a letter to KA, Dean Terry
explained the position of the AEC:
“While we believe the monitors
should have carded individuals
who were violating the policy, we
believe it is the house’s responsi-
bility to aid them in thatendeavor.”
KA was given only a warning for
the offense because of the confu-
sion over the policy.

~ Dean Terry said that this clari-

fication constituted “nothing radi-
cal” and that the AEC simply wants
Patterson Court Houses to aid
monitors in enforcing the alcohol
policy. As long as a House coop-
erates with the monitors, he ex-
plained, the House itself should
not be charged with an alcohol
violation. He also said, “We can’t
expect the president or other offic-
ers to be present at every event or
for the whole event, but there
should be a person designated to
be in charge who can assist the
monitors and take responsibility

for the order of the house.”

Dean Terry also said that the
monitors will be briefed on the role
of houses in enforcing the policy.
Inthe letter sent to Patterson Court
Houses, the AEC said, “The com-
mittee will be addressing these is-
sues with the monitors, for while
we believe the houses have the
responsibility for cooperating and
assisting, the monitors are being
paid to carry the majority of the
enforcement burden.”

CCRL Studies Quality of Life at Davidson
Council Responsible for Creation of New Alcohol Policy

By Leigh Rawdon

Many Davidson students may
not realize that the college admin-
‘istration continually seeks student
input about issues that affect cam-
pus social life. In 1976 Davidson
established the Council on Cam-
pus and Religious Life to advise
the President and the Dean of Stu-
dents concerning possible prob-
lems and potential improvements,

Last spring the CCRL’s most
significant effort involved the cre-
ation of the new alcohol policy.
The council worked diligently to
install a policy that both followed
North Carolina state law and satis-
fied Davidson students. The Stu-
dent Government’s ad-hoc com-
mittee and the Patterson Court
Council contributedadditional stu-

dent suggestions but the CCRL
acted as the actual editors of the
policy. The council will evaluate
the new alcohol policy after spring
break.

The current issue addressed
by the CCRL involves the estab-
lishment of guidelines for the
Patterson Court Council and indi-
vidual houses. These guidelines
could set standards for cleanliness

and social management including -

possible leadership training for
house officers. These standards
would help define the role of the
Patterson Court Council and help
houses understand general Court
policies.

Sophomore Joanna Boyd said
that another subject that the CCRL
has discussed is the insufficient

number of social options on cam-
pus. The Council considered in-
creasing publicity of Union activi-
ties and possibly adding a pool
table or ping pong table to the
Outpost. Boyd also noted that
changes in the meal plan and the
cafe hours were brought to the
council’s attention.

A future assignment for asub-
committee of the CCRL will be to
evaluate whether or not SAE will
be allowed on campus next year.

Chairman Dean Terry stated
that the CCRL, “could possibly be
a strong force for a new college
Union.” According to Terry the
council addresses anything that
might affect the quality of social
life at Davidson. This includes any
religious aspect since the chaplain

serves as an ex-officio member
and may use the CCRL to advance
his agenda.

The CCRL consists of eight
elected andappointed students, the
presidents of the SGA, Reach Out,
the Union Board, and the PCC. In
addition to the student representa-
tives there are nine faculty and
administration members. _ Terry
said,”the council is valuable be-
cause it includes input from three
elements of campus: faculty, stu-
dents, and administration.”

Elections and appointments
occur in the spring semester for
any student interested in serving
on the CCRL;:

annual North Mecklenburg Christ-
mas parade.

The festival was organized by
the Downtown Davidson Organi-
zation. Chairperson Irene
Blackwell, owner of The Village
Store, explained thatthe non-profit
group consists of representatives
from Main Street businesses and
the College, as well as towns-
people, whose goal is to promote
downtown and solicit business to
make it an active, profitable area.

The DDO coordinated indi-
vidual store’s events and invited
other non-profit organizations,

suchas The Lion’sClub, Davidson
PTA, Habitat for Humanity and
WDAYV, totake part in the celebra-
tion. They also convinced busi-
nesses, such as local banks and
Duke Power, to sponsor carriage
rides and other events.

Blackwell stressed that the
week’s activities were not only to
promoft business, but: to further
the spirit of Christmas as well.

As Ere Harben, owner of
‘Anna’s Antiques put it, “It’s more
of a homey, family atmosphere.
It’s like Christmas should be.”

nitely gotten into the spirit. The
parents of senior sweeper Craig
Omli, whoin he described as “crazy
soccer fans,” made sweatshirts
which spell GO DAVIDSON for
all the team mothers when they
stand together in the bleachers.

Professors have also rallied
around the Wildcats, travelling to
away games and accommodating
the students’ interest in the games
on Friday. Dr. Tony Abbott post-
poned his Friday afternoon classes
tomorrow due to the tournament,
commenting, “It seemsonly fair to
rearrange our classes in light of
this historic event.”

Dean of Students Will Terry
is excited about what athletic suc-

_ cess will mean to the college as a

whole. “I think it proves that a
school like Davidson can do this
kind of thing withstyle,” said Terry.
“Tt will help other sports in that it
gives us a high profile.” He con-
tinued, “Such success ought tohelp
general student recruiting as well
as sports recruiting” because of
name recognition.

Not since the 1960’s, when
the basketball team was in its hey-
day, has Davidson enjoyed cham-
pionship-caliber sports at the Divi-
sion I level. Students at colleges
like Davidson often feel that they
must sacrifice the excitement. of
big-time athletics for the advan-
tages of asmall liberal artscollege.
Coach Slagle and his heroic team
have proven otherwise... Win or
108e, the-soccer team has provided
anunforgettable experience which
has brought out the bestin its play-
ers and fans and undoubtedly will
go down in Davidson history.
