By CHARLIE SLAGLE
and

RICK HUSSIAN
Staff Writers

The overall point totals have
been calculated including the
results of volleyball action.

F&M, the flickerball, wrest-
ling, swimming and golf cham-
pions, is leading the standings
by an overwhelming margin.

They have amassed 902.20
points followed by PDT (697.48)
and the SPE‘s (692.90).

From the new social system

have emerged the fourth and
fifth teams, PAX (565.90) and

Emanon (547.18).

The SAE‘s (515.90), BTP (477.-
40), Watts 11 (438.80), the only
freshman team to capture an
intramural championship, Can-
non I! (401.46) and Sentelle |
{381.06) complete the top ten.

No track meet will be held
to affect the standings. and af-
ter tennis and softball finals.
little change in the top five is
expected. F&M will only in-
crease its lead since they are in
tbe finals im both sports.

Tennis tournament play which
began this week includes only
six teams, two from each lea-
gue. This small number was

chosen since many matches
were not reported.

The SPE’s ard F&M received
byes in first round action due

to their 7-0 records while Gor-

don’s faced PAX 1. In that match

Charlie Slagle and Steve Earp
(PAX I) defeated Tim Winter
and Alex Gordon, respectively.
The Faculty has already beat-
en the ATO‘s to advance to the
semifinals.

This match was forced into
doubles because of split wins in
singles competition. H. Ed-
munds White beat Doug Berry
while Charlie Summers defeat-
ed Benjamin Klein.

The finals were scheduled for
yesterday on the varsity courts
but will now probably be. held
on Monday.

In softball, League A is dom.
inated by the Betas (8-1) and
the Delt’s (7-2). These two teams
are assured of tournament spots
whereas the other two spots are
still net designated.

Three teams, the ATO’s, Our
Boys Gang and PAX I all have
6-3 records. A play-off will be
held for the remaining slots.

Watts II, in contention for a
slot until yesterday, was up-
set by Emanon and cannot be

ccnsidered for the tournament.

The play-off positions in Lea-
gue B have already been deci-
ded. F&M leads the pack with
an 8-1 record with Hurtin’ Herd,
the Pikas, and Staten Island
Ferries ending regular scason
play at 7-2.

With intramural activity wind-
ing down for this year, new of-
ficers have already been elect-
ed for next year’s Intramural
Activities Council.

The new president will be
Dave Griffiths, with Calvin Al-
len as vice president and Bob
Newman the secretary.

We’re doing away with
the board plan. In its place we’re
gonna use a new kinda money.
It'll give you complete flexibility
just like real money. And you'll
always be certain of your next
meal, like with the board plan.
For us, the new money means
better budgeting. See, we'll know how
much money is circulating and how
much we can spend. So we won’t be
buying food you won’t be buying. ,

And since we'll be able to it .
make better buys, you'll get better Ay!) ‘ )
