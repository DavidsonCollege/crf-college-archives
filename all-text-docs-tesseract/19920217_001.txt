Davidson to Host 1992, 1993 NCAA Soccer Finals

By Bruce Balestier

The NCAA Division I Men’s
Soccer Committee Tuesday chose
Davidson over two other sites as
the host. of the semifinals and fi-
nals of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA
Men’s Soccer Tournaments. It is
all but a certainty that their recom-
mendation will be formally con-
firmed in May by the NCAA Ex-
ecutive Committee. This year’s
semifinals and finals will take place
December 4 and 6 at Richardson
Field.

The Soccer Committee evi-
dently was swayed by the presen-
tation made February 5 by athletic
director Terry Holland, men’s soc-
cer coach Charlie Slagle and mar-
keting director Pat Millen. That
presentation included statements

of support from North Carolina
Governor James G. Martin, Char-
lotte Mayor Rich-
ard Vinroot, and
several local busi-
nesses and televi-
sion stations. In
addition, virtually
every college soc-
cer coach in the
area committed
his support to the
Davidson bid.
Davidson’s
facilities and prox-
imity to Charlotte,
the seating capac-
ity of Richardson
Field (6,200) and
the vital local and sciiginal soccer

into the successful presentation.
Said Slagle, “We convinced the

Committee that the college com-

rnoto By beth Pharr

will get behind this. And I think it
will happen.” .

“This is great! ,”
Holland: said.
“Davidson is the per-
fect school to host
the NCAA soccer
championship. We
have a small school
but its gota big heart
and is a vital part of
the larger Charlotte
community, which
has grown rapidly as
a center of sports
activity. I believe it
will be strongly sup-
ported by the com-
munity. We'll do
everything within our power to

championship ever.”

Slagle anticipates adding
2,000-3,000 temporary seats to the
permanent stands at Richardson
Field for the tournament. The
playing surface still contains some
ridges from the field’s widening
last summer, but the Davidson
grounds crew has already set a
timetable for fixing them. Johnston
Gym will likely serve as a media
center during the event, and the
Vail Commons will host the tour-
nament banquet.

The event should give a boost
to the already strong Davidson
soccer program. CBS broadcasts
the event nationwide, and that
exposure should make Slagle’s

Student Receives Sanctions
After Lengthy Honor Council Trial

By Tom Koonce and David
Smyth
On Friday February 14 the
Honor Council convened in Phi
Hall to examine an alleged viola-
tion of Section IV of the Code of
Responsibility. Junior Philip
Atchison was accused of threaten-
ing another member of the student

‘body, freshman: Braulio Lopez,

overthe phone. Atchison pleaded
guilty to the charge of leaving a
harassing message on Lopez’s
answering machine. Atchison
turned himself in to Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry on February 6 in
an admission of his guilt.

The trial was open to the public
at the request of Atchison. It began
at 5:30 p.m. Friday afternoon with
presentation of witnesses by the
defense and ended at 12:45 a.m.
early Saturday morning with clos-

ing statements by the solicitorsand
defense. At this time the council
entered into executive session to
decide what sanctions Atchison
should receive. The six voting
council members and the secretary
deliberated for another hour and a
half before reaching agreement on
Atchison’s punishment. | The
members of the Honor Council who
listened to this case and decided on
the sanctions were Lee Canipe,
Carter Payne, Catherine Milligan,
Peter Amidon, Matt Bumstead
(secretary) and Chairman of the.
Honor Council, John Howell.

The council imposed alcohol
and social probation on Atchison
until December and said that he
must undergo alcohol counseling.
They also stated that he must per-
form 100 hours of community
service under the guidance’ of

Assistant Dean of Students John
Eaves. Atchison must also enroll
in a course in multiculturalism at
Johnson C. Smith University. The
council stated that Atchison must
send a written apology to Lopez
and must meet together with Lopez
and Dean Terry. The council also
said that Atchison must write two
columns in The Davidsonian.. He
must write one now about his opin-
ions and feelings of what has hap-
pened and one after he has com-
pleted the J.C. Smith Course and
the community service.

Atchison was represented by
four defense advisers. The current
advisers, Tom Cors and Brendan
O’ Sullivan, asked the questions to
witnesses while the advisers-elect,
Arthur Morehead and David Lind-

S tudent Conduct Council Makes Changes to Honor Code

By Tom Koonce

The Student Conduct Council
recently passed changes to the
Davidson Honor Code after dis-
cussing such action for the past
several months. Over the course of
last semester and the beginning of
this one they met several times,
once with David Thompson and
once with the entire Honor Coun-
cil, to discuss possible changes.
Thompson, former Editor-in-Chief

Davidsonian Editorship Changes Hands

» By David Smyth
On Friday, January 31, the
Media Board unanimously ap-
proved Walter Price as editor-in-
chief of The Davidsonian for 1992-
3. Afterendorsements from David
Thompson and David Smyth, out-
going chief editor and managing
editor, respectively, Price was
voted in without incident.
‘Price has been the executive
editor for the past year and at this

of the Davidsonian, i is a proponent
of the implementation of a jury
system.

The SCC mandated a change
in the election procedure that will
enable more Honor Council
members to participate in the elec-
tion of chairman. Instead of elect-
ing three representatives in the
spring, the sophomore and junior
classes will now elect six mem-
bers each in the fall. This means

pointis in a better position to keep
the newspaper rolling than any
other editor in years. He will be
ably assisted by new associate
editors Tom Koonce and Tom Price
and new managing editor Sarah
Gayle.

The new head was praisewor-
thy of the past regime, but sees
room for improvement this year.
“David (Thompson) has done a
really good job and has made the

these days, but it won’t hurt to be

that students will not elect mem-
bers to the Honor Council in their
freshmen and senior years. Stu-
dents will therefore have additional
time to select the first representa-
tives from their classes. This will
allow formorethorough peer evalu-
ation and adjustment to the Col-
lege environment.

The election of Honor Coun-
cil chairman will occur at the end
of the spring and seniors will serve

until their graduation. This means
that seniors will now be able ‘to
vote for chairman of the Honor
Council. The total number of
Honor Council members voting for
the chairman will thus move from
18 to 30.

The SCC also considered but
declined to institute the jury sys-
tem. In other decisions, the SCC
mandated a mock trial early in the
fall for freshmen.

These new proposals will not
go into effect until next year. The
changes will now be sent to Presi-
dent Kuykendall for his approval.
Next year's chariman and secre-
tary will be elected in the next
couple of weeks by the Honor
Council. Elections formembers of
the Honor Council from the fresh-
men, sophomore and junior classes
will be this Tuesday February 18.

long time. I still think we can do
more toopen up The Davidsonian

mightbe something of a buzzword

plan to make concerted efforts to
gather writers and editors from
groups on campus other than our
own,”’
