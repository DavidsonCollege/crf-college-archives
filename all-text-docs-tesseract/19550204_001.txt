YMCA Announces Plans
For Discussion Groups

The Y.M.C.A. announced today that plans are now being
made to begin two study-discussion groups and a Seminar on
Courtship, Marriage and the Family. The study-discussion
groups are intended to begin the week following the Univer-
sity Christian Mission and the Seminar probably after Spring
vacation, continuing through the month of April.

The two areas for the study
groups are intended to provide op-
portunity for study to students in-
terested in either Christian Faith
Heritage or Christianity and Con-
temporary Social Problems. The
plan of action is to meet once
every two weeks for discussion
centering around a pamphlet or
book to be chosen for study by the
group. These materials may range
from the small study booklets pre-
pared by the National Student
YM-YW to Paul Tillich’s The
Protestent Era or Reinhold Nie-
buhr’s tnterpretation of Christian
Gthies. Time and place of meeting
will be announced at a later time.

The Seminar on Courtship, Mar-
riage and the Family, as projected
at the present, will cover four ma-
jor areas: Human relations seen in
the context of the Biblical Faith;
Courtship (dating and pre-marital
relations); Marriage, including the
sexual, social, psychological, and
economic aspects of the institution;
and the family. It is anticipated
that leading authorities will be
secured for this seminar and that
it will be organized in terms of
realistic preparation for marriage.
The sessions may be co-education-
al at certain points in the seminar
to provide a broader understanding

Eumanean Soclely
Holds Two Meetings

Eumanean Literary Society held
two meetings in recent weeks. A
regular meeting on January 17 fea-
tured readings by Dr. Chalmers
Davidson from the book he is now
writing.

The book is to be a history of
life at Davidson, as told through
the letters of five succeeding gen-
erations of fictitious students. The
readings given came from the first
of the five proposed sections, and
purported to be letters of 1637
from a student named Caldwell
Pharr, a combination of the two
most common names of David-
son students during the first
twenty years of the college.

The meeting on January 30 was
a very brief one to organize for
the second semester. After the
usual roll call and devotional, of-
ficers were elected. Tom Dove re-
placed Tim Cooper as president,
while Joe Conarroe and Dan La-
far were elected vice president and
secretary, respectively. Tony Dick
will remain as treasurer.

YMCA Is Operating
Placement Service

The Y.M.C.A. is again operating
a Summer Placement Service for
all students in the College, Sam
Magill, General Secretary of the
“Yy” announced today. The service
is designed to assist men in locat-
ing experiences in three major
areas: Summer service; camp and

Some of the most attractive op-
portunities are being posted on the
bulletin board outside the Y.M.C.A.
office in the Union Building.
Further information can be ob-
tained from the General Secre-
tary. At the present time employ-

“~~|ment is offered in ten summer

camps, co-ed and all male; numer-
ous opportunities for service
through the American Friends’
Service Committee in work camps,
institutional service, interne pro-
grams in industry, etc., a few op-
portunities in business, especially
for chemistry and physics majors,
a few resort jobs open in New Eng-
land and the Far West. In the next
few weeks more opportunities will
arise.

If you are interested in place-
ment, come by the Y.M.C.A. office,
fill out a card for our files, and
talk with the General Secretary
about the possibilities.

Private Devotionals in
Chopel Next Week

In order that Davidson students
might worship in private during
University Christian Mission Week,
Lingle Chapel will be opened at
7:46 a.m. Monday through Thurs-
day.

The playing of the chimes will
replace the usual 7:15 a.m. bell
and also the 10:30 Wednesday Hall
prayer meeting bell. The playing
of the chimes will be a period of
silent prayer.

Student Body fo See
Constitution Feb. 11

Floyd Feeney, president of
the student body, announced
this week that the new student
government constitution will
go before the student body
Friday, Feb. HW, 1955, in
chapel. Mimeographed copies
of the new constitution will be
handed out et this time.

The February 11, 1955, issue
of The Davidsonian will carry
@ discussion of the proposed
changes.

The Constitution is now be-
fore a faculty committee for a
thorough goingover before
being presented to the faculty
for their vote. The definition
of “pledged work’ is the prob-
lem stumping the committee
now, but this is expected to be
ironed out within the next few
days so thet it can be pre-
sented to the feculty for di-
rect approval and then on to
the student body on February
VW.

Perrin Anderson and his
committee have been working
on this revision since the be-
ginning of the school year.

UCM Book Committee
Will Sponsor Display

In connection with the Univer-
sity Christian Mission due to be-
gin next week on the Davidson
campus, the Book-Display Commit-
tee of the YMCA has announced
plans for displaying books and
pamphlets pertinent to the topic:
“A Mature Christian in a Chang-
ing South.” Chairman Jim Marsh-
all and his committee have ar-
ranged for the literature to be
available for inspection and pur-
chasing in the Student Union dur-
ing third period and from 9 p.m.
to 11 p.m. throughout the UCM
week.

Among the books included in
display through the courtesy of
Efird Department Store are: Rein-
hold Niebuhr’s The trony of Ameri-
can History; Harry Emerson Fos-
dick’s A Faith for Tough Times;
John C. Bennett's Christian Ethics
and Social Policy; and Chad
Walsh’s Campus Gods on Trial.

Correlative material runs from
free pamphlets through the less
expensive booklets, and up to the
better known authors and authori-
ties on ethical and Southern prob-
lems (e.g., the Southern Presby-
terian stand on segregation and
the report of the World Council
of Churches at Evanston; a series
of Sociel Action).

An understanding of the UCM
and the problems of the contem-
porary South with which it deals
is related directly to our knowl-
edge of the situation around us
and the solutions that have been
suggested for these problems.

FORTY-FIRST YEAR
OF CONTINUOUS

PUBLICATION

NUMBER 13

University Christian Mission Begins
With Services On Sunday Morning

UCM Week Features
Movie, Seminars, and
Frat Bull Sessions

As part of the University Chris-
tian Mission Program a number of
special features are planned
throughout the week.

These special features include
a movie to be shown in the Union
Ballroom Tuesday evening, speak-
ers in classrooms and personal
conferences, afternoon seminars,
and bull sessions at the fraternity
houses in the evenirig.

The movie “Pinky” will be
shown in the College Union at 7
p.m., Tuesday evening, to be fol-
lowed by a discussion led by Col.
Francis P. Miller.

“Pinky” is a deeply moving ex-
posuré of racial prejudices as’ it
affects the life of a light-com-
plexioned colored girl, and the in-
ward struggle she undergoes in
making her choice between marry-
ing a white doctor and leading a
comfortable life in the North or
continuing the work for which she
had trained, that of aiding the
colored. people in the South.

Newsweek describes the movie
as a “drama fit to stand alongside
“Gentleman's Agreement,” the
Academy Award winning joust
against anti-Semitism.” The maga-
zine continues to say that the pic-
ture “does an admirable job of
blending a courageous approach
to racism and the strictly emo-
tional factors of Pinky's personal
history.”

The picture stars Jeanne Crain
as Pinky, with Ethel Barrymore,
Ethel Waters, William Lundigan,
and a fine supporting cast, “The
movie concentrates so relentlessly
on Pinky’s personal anguish,” Time
magazine states, “that it achieves
a haunting character portrait.”

Speakers will be heard in various
classrooms each morning, and per-
sonal conferences can be arranged
with the speakers during this time.

Seminars will be held each after-
noon from 3:30 to 5:30 in the Ball-
room of the College Union. The
subject of Monday afternoon's
seminar will be “The Christian
Basis for Concern with Social
Problems.” The discussion will be
led by Dr. Addison Leitch and The
Rev. Harry Smith.

On Tuesday afternoon the sub-
ject will be “The Christian Looks] —
at Labor and Management in the
South,” with the discussion led by
Dr. Lester McAllister.

Wednesday’s seminar, led by Dr.
Waldo Beach, will discuss “Segre-
gation, Mongrelization or Integra-
tion?” “Political Responsibility
and the Christian Faith” will be
the subject of Thursday's seminar,
with Col. Francis P. Miller lead-
ing the discussion.

On Monday, Tuesday, and Wed-
nesday evenings, bull sessions will
be held at the Kappa Alpha, Kap-
pa Sigma, and Beta Theta Pi fra-
ternity houses from 8 to 9 p.m.

“Dr. Lester McAllister will lead
the bull session Monday evening
at the KA house, The Rev, Harry
Smith at the KS house, and Col.
Francis Miller at the BTPi house.

Tuesday evening The Rev. Harry
Smith will lead the bull session at
the KA house, Dr. Lester McAllis-
ter at the KS house, and Dr. Ad-
dison Leitch at the BTPi house.

The bull session will be led

house by Dr. Addison Leitch, at

Due to serious delays which have
taken place in the construction of
W. H. Belk Dormitory, it will not
be possible for students to occupy
the building until the fall semester,
it was announced yesterday by D.
Grier Martin, Treasurer of the Col-
lege.

In spite of all efforts on the
part of the contractor and sup-
pliers of materials for the building
it has been necessary to advance
the scheduled completion date sev-
eral times, the last estimate being
that the building will be ready on
April Ist unless some unexpected
problem causes another delay. If
no further change in this date oc-
curred this would have meant that
students could not move into the
building until about the middle of
April. Even then there would have
been a number of disadvantages
to having students occupy the

and landscaping will not be com-
pleted by that time.

Among the problems which have
prevented occupancy this year
were the inclement weather, delays
-in the receipt of the limestone for
the building, in getting the chest
units which are to be built into
each room, in getting the roof on
the building, and in getting heat
into the building so that plaster-
ing and painting could be done.

nounced that the play which had
been originally scheduled for
December 9, will be given Feb-
ruary 17 and 18, in Chambers audi-
torium. Performances were pre-
viously postponed because of ill
ness in the cast.

Senior Fred Summers will take
the role of the misbehaving bishop.
