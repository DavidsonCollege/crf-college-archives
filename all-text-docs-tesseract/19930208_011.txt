the referee. The conversation led
to a technical foul for Alpert, and
Charlton Young made one of the
two free throws. Dexter Abrams
nailed a three-pointer on the ensu-
ing possession to give Georgia
Southern a commanding 72-61
advantage. Young was the chief
beneficiary of Davidson fouls from
that point, finishing the afternoon
10 of 12 from the free-throw line.

Zimmerman led Davidson
with 14 points, while Janko Narat
and Detlef Muschadded 13. Young
was the ‘Cats’ main thorn Satur-
day, notching 23 points; Calvin
Sinkfield scored 20, and Abrams
had 18.

Davidson capitalized on 64%
of its attempts from the floor at
Western Carolina in earning a 12-
point victory in the teams’ first
meeting. At home on Jan. 31,
Davidson shot 68.1% (32-47) in
trouncing the Catamounts, 82-63.
With the victory, Davidson fin-
ished its six-game homestand
against Southern Conference op-
ponents with five wins.

Narat led all scorers with 21

points, followed by Zimmerman
with 17 and Musch with 14. The
‘Cats only trailed once, early in the
contest, and outrebounded West-
ern by a 46-28 count.

° “T wasalittleconcerned about
how we would play today,” head
coach Bob McKillop said after his
club fell, 80-73, to conference
leader UT-Chattanooga the previ-
ous aftemoon. “We came out a
little lethargic but responded like
mature veterans in the second half.”

After taking a 34-28 advan-
tage into the locker room at half-
time, the “Cats returned to ensure
that Western would not pick up its
first conference win of the season.
Up by six, 49-43, with 14:15 re-
maining, the ‘Cats pounded out a
13-0 run in the next three minutes.
Narat began the onslaugitt by mak-
ing a 14-foot jumper on which ie
was fouled and hitting the free
throw. Zimmerman nailed a three-
pointer and a 12-footer down the
stretch.
