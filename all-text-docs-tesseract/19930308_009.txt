For Diversity: Say Goodbye to Clusters, Eating Houses

ments. Students would have no
choice but to open their eyes to the
prospective friend living with them.

This measure can goeven far-
ther. Davidson’s small size does
not lend itself to variety, Minori-
ties fill only a miniscule portion of
the total enrollment. For the same
reasons mentioned before, minori-

ties might wish to room together;
they often share similar back-
grounds and interests. These
cliques should be discouraged. If
Davidson students need exposure
to alternative elements, minorities
must live as far apart as possible.
Not only will they learn from such
an experience, the rest of the stu-
dents’ exposure to minority cul-
ture and lifestyle will be distrib-

Where is Seattle, Anyway?

guitarist Dave Pirner was ex-
tremely drunk but never missed.a
note. If you saw the MTV Inaugu-
ral Bash, ol’ Dave hada few too
many that night as well and fell on
his can at the beginning of the
second song, “Black Gold.” It was
funny for so many reasons.
Besides “Somebody to
Shove,” (the one Johnboy & Billy
play) the new album Grave Danc-
ers Union isagoodone. It’salittle

butevery song on the disc is worth
listening to. If youare going to buy

one of their albums, get And the
Horse They Rode In On, the one
previous to GraveDancers Union.
It is probably in my top three al-
bums EVER.

The big shift from Seattle has
begun. Cities like Minneapolis
and New York are once again seiz-
ing the reigns of underground
music. It’shard forme to honk the
horn for bands like Husker Du and
Soul Asylum without being slightly
proud of my current home state.
And youthought nothing goodever
came out of Minnesota! We’ve
got 10,000 lakes and at least two
bands that are worth a damn.

uted equally throughout campus.
A forced separation from friends
may seem unpleasant, but in order
to make the school more appealing
to minorities, everyone must sacri-
fice some luxuries.
Wecannotend our reform with
just housing. Cancers appear ev-
erywhere in the Davidson commu-
nity. The most obvious offenders
are social organizations. Fraterni-
ties, the BSC, and the women’s
eating houses do little to foster
diversity and understanding. Dis-
banding them and forcing ran-
domly assigned seats in the Com-
mons (to be reassigned weekly, of
course) would solve that problem
quickly and painlessly. The result-
ing lull in social activity would not
discourage prospective students,
especially with the exciting 900
Roomactivities: the Tibetan Monks
last visit provoked hysteria, and
who could forget that speaker on
the North Carolina State Legisla-
ture. Furthermore, the community
service performed by cating houses

and fraternities would most likely “

continue despite the lack of orga-
nization and drop in incentive.
With these enormous cliques

conquered, other seemingly inno-
centand nonthreatening organiza-
tions may replace them. FLAG,
New Vagabonds, and Club Tennis
might harvest lasting friendships
amongst similar people, thus ne-
cessitating their destruction. If
worse comes to worst, the Honor

"Fraternities, the BSC, and
the women's eating houses
do little to foster diversity
and understanding. Dis-
banding them and forcing
randomly assigned seats in
the Commons would solve
that problem."

Council may have to go. Strong
friendships pervade every aspect

of college life. For us to force

these friendships aside in order to
create new ones, we must intensify
our efforts.

In the past, these efforts in-
volved Bonus Bucks: a tempting
lure away from house food to the

Commons. Though well planned,
students imagined shortcomings in
the deal. On the social scene, the
Outpost: experienced limited suc-
cess on weekends. Its video game
and juke box attract only a few as
a party alternative. The failure of
these innocent plans to affect stu-
dent behavior forces us to switch
to more aggressive tactics. All
social groups must cease to exist.
We must desegregate all types of
people. If need be, court orders
should be procured to keep friends
from speaking.

We must set aside the inter-
ests of the students to ensure a
diverse campus. We must disre-
gard the inevitable ensuing dis-
content in order to guarantee a
peaceful, friendly student body.
This college will triumph over in-
tolerance and misunderstanding,
even if it comes to confiscating
every student’s personal freedom
for the duration of their sentence.
Wecannothave sufficientharmony
on campus without sufficient con-
trol.
