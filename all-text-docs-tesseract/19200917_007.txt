FRESH PARADE A FAILURE.

On the night of September 8, the
Annual Fresh parade was started,
with about 40 very timid and nerv-
ous members of class ’24 as parti-
cipants. Begnnning at- the front
of Watts, the parade wended its
EIGHT — DAVIDSONIAN —
way as far as the well, where some
of the student body officers re-
minded those who were the insti-
gators, that Davidson would toler-
ate no formal hazing. This being
the case the frightened fresh were
released and allowed to return to
their respective abodes. Thus end-
ed the fresh parade.

GOLD CHEVRONS
FOR SERVICE ABROAD

Lex Kluttz, 15, of Chester Back |
From Overseas Only to Leave
Soon for Syria.

If Lex Kluttz of Chester is not the
only veteran in South Carolina en-
titled to wear five gold chevrons for
service overseas, he is certainly one
of a chosen few. Mr. Kluttz re-
turned only recently after 31
months with the American army in
Europe, and now, after a short stay,
he goes to Beirut, Syria, where he
will be an instructor in a Christian
college.

Mr. Kluttz was in Columbia re-
cently for the first time since “be-
fore the war,” and renewed many
old acquaintances. His special busi-
ness was to have a conference on
Christian Endeavor work with
Wyatt Taylor, president of the state
union, but he also found time to see
some of his warm friends in the
capital city.

t is only by chance that Mr.
Kluttz is not at present in Antwerp
with the American Olympic team,
for he was in the army finals at St.
Louis for the 440 and the 100, but
after a trip across the Atlantic on
a slow boat and a hard rail trip to
Missouri, he was not in the finést
condition for the games. While he
should have been getting into the
finest shape, he was traveling, and
thus was handicapped in the events.
His friends, however, expect to see
him qualify in the 1924 games.

Mr. Kluttz, who is a graduate of
Davidson College, and who made’ a
fine athletic record at that institu-
tion, went across soon after the
United States entered the war, and
he was fortunate in seeing exceed-
ingly interesting service. After the
armistice he was made assistant to

occupation, and as such got an op-
portunity for much travel. He was
given a school appointment to Scot-
land, where he spent several months
ina great university. After this he
was in Coblenz with the
chaplain, and in his work traveled

Poland and Czecho-Slovakia.

years, being honored his last year
with an All-American selection. In
addition to his football he was a
track star, winning his D_ three
times and setting records for the
shot put and discus events.

Not satisfied with the knowledge
and cunning he had gained by three
years’ Varsity ball, he went to Chi-
cago and isconsin Universities
and studied the art and science of
football and basketball under the
great masters of the game, and now
he is back to give his alma mater
the benefit of what he has gained.

That he is more than welcome and
that he will have the support of the

dents received him and accorded him

Capt. Hearn. .

Capt. Thomas G. Hearn, head and
instructor of the military depart-
ment at Davidson College this year,
is an officer in every way fitted for
his position. He both has the mil-
itary experience to form here a
capable and_ efficient R. O. T. C.
unit, and is a Southerner of the type
to understand Southern boys. One
ot his classmates at West Point in
speaking of him said:

“You will be fortunate if you get
Hearn. He was the best man in
our class.”

Capt. Hearn was born in Tuske-
gee, Ala., twenty-nine years ago, at-
tended Auburn College, and then en-
tered West Point with the class of
1915. Here he had an excellent
record, and in his academic work
and gencral reputation stood high
with both instructors and cadets.
Since the completion of his course
at West Point he has also graduated
at the School of Arms, Fort Sill,
Okla., and the Army Machine Gun
School at Tangus. Before the
World War he served with an in-
fantry regiment and took part in
the Pershing Expedition into Mex-

a machine gun battalion in France
with the tempory rank of major,
serving in a sector in the Vosges
Mountains and taking part in the
Argonne offensive.

Capt. Hearn has not yet located
a suitable home at Davidson, and
Mrs. Hearn on that account will
not be here as soon as was first
planned. However, it is safe to pre-
dict that Capt. and Mrs. Hearn will
be liked and admired by all of us.

16, 1920. On the following day he
reenlisted as a private in the field
artillery and was transferred
Camp Bragg where he was pro-
moted to the grade of regimental
supply sergeant. He was assigned
to Davidson College for R. O. T. C.
duty and reported here on July 7,
1920. Sergeant Champ will have
charge of all the supply work con-
nected with this unit.

Davidson is glad to have these
men here and from their past rec-
ords it is certain that they will
rove valuable additions to the col-
lege as well as to the battalion.
