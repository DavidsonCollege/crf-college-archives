Too bad Davidson can’t play VMI every
game.

Two of the Wildcats’ three Southern Con-
ference wins this season have come against
the Keydets, the most recent a 70-67 decision

on Tuesday night.

For a team coming into the game having
lost six of its last season games, getting a win-

the second half,

and came up with crucial plays in the final
minutes to thwart VMI’s comeback attempts.

“I didn’t want what happened last time
against UNCG (a 63-61 loss on Saturday
night) to happen again,” said Bernard.

Martin Ides added 15 points and 10 re-
bounds on 7-11 shooting-- his first career
double-double in a Div. I game.

The Wildcats (9-13, 3-6) opened and closed
the first half strongly, using a 10-0 run to take
a 38-28 lead at halftime.

As has been the case many times this sea-
son, the lead didn’t last.

Radee Skipworth’s three-pointer at the 4:26
mark gave the Keydets (5-14,

2-7) a 61-60 lead.

That’s when Bernard went to work.

With the score tied at 65, Bernard nailed a
jumper and made three of four free throws
down the stretch to pull out the win.

“We did it at their fort in front of their
army,” Said head coach Bob McKillop. “A lot
of heart tonight.”

Wildcats squander lead, drop another nailbiter to UNCG

After thundering to a 17-2 lead midway
through the first half, Davidson could only
ro look on in disbe-
lief as the UNC
Greensboro
Spartans claimed
a63-61 victory in
the last six. sec-
onds of the game
on a pair of Courtney Eldridge free throws
Saturday night in Belk Arena.

Déja vu, anybody?

Last year in Belk Arena, last second hero-
ics by Eldridge ruined a game that the Wild-
cats had well in hand. The lightning quick
guard bolted past the scorers’ table while
Landry Kosmalski gave chase, but Eldridge
nailed a three as the buzzer wailed, putting
the Spartans on top 77-75.

Fast forward to Saturday night.

With 12 seconds left, Wayne Bernard was
preparing to take possession for Davidson
after the Spartans’ Nathan Jameson had just
drained two free throws to tie the score at 61.
Bernard faced Eldridge one-on-one in the
backcourt as the Wildcats set two screens for
Bernard on the other end of the floor.

Before Bernard even got out from under
the shadow of his own goal, Eldridge snatched
the dribble away from him. A dazed Bernard

swung around just time to see Eldridge going
up for the layup and he scrambled to foul the
Spartans’ junior } =
guard.

ily made his two
free throws,

did not drop.

“To hold a team to 29-percent shooting,
play the kind of defense we played, and
generate the kind of offense we did and still
loose is very disappointing,” head coach Bob

_ McKillop said. “Our guys poured their hearts
out tonight. They played with tremendous

intensity.”

Inspired defensive play and confident jump-
shooting helped the Wildcats dominate the
first 10 minutes of the game. During the 17-
2 Wildcat run that opened the game, nine
Wildcat points came from outside the paint,
including a Fern Tonella three-pointer that

-put the Wildcats on the board first.

The Spartans, in contrast, seemed

discombobulated, sending cross-court passes
into the stands and appearing generally dis-
rupted by the Wildcats’ intensity. They con-
nected on only one of their first 10 shots and
struggled to find a weak seam in the Wild-
cats’ game that they could exploit and use to
gain some leverage.

In the waning minutes of the first half,
however, things began to change. An 11-0
Spartan run over three minutes cut the Wild-

cats lead to one—26-25—by the two-minute ~

mark. Therun was aided in large part by three
Wildcat turnovers, a problem that plagued
Davidson throughout the night.

“Turnovers were important,” said
McKillop, whose squad committed 25 turn-
overs. It’s not that we missed shots or didn’t
have opportunities. It’s the 10 or 12 points
they scored on our miscues.”

Those Davidson miscues helped Greens-
boro tie the game at 53 with 4:30 left to play
in game. For the next four minutes, the
Wildcats and Spartans exchanged free throws
and tied the game three more times before
Eldridge’s fateful steal.

“We wanted Wayne with the ball in his
hands,” said McKillop, referring to the last-
second isolation play that Eldridge robbed.

“Wayne is who you want to have the ball at —

crunch time.
“But thing for us to remember now is that
we can’t feel sorry for ourselves.”
