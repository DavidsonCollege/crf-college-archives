MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS
DR. PORTER

The regular meeting of the Ministerial
Sand was held Sunday afternoon in
Shearer Hall. The speaker, Dr. W. L.
Porter, presented an interesting talk on
the subject Thoroughly Furnished.

Dr. Porter said: “In contemplating the
building of my new house, I came to
think of the likeness of a thoroughly
furnished man.”

In his speech, he showed how a man,
like a house, was a shell if not properly
furnished. He compared the living-room
to the social side of man, the kitchen to
his physical life, the study-room to his
mental life, the bath, where the body is
cleansed to the devotional side of man,
whereby he is able to clean his, heart.
The sacrificial side of man was likened
to the furnace-room of a house which
sent warmth to the whole house. The
attic was represented as the occasional
side of life. Everything is put there,
which is old and worn-out, but which
can be used if necessary. Dr. Porter
said “This the candidate for the min-
istry especially.needs, for it is in. this
store-room of his house, that he is able

to use on all occasions.”

An appeal was made to the ministerial
students to furnish themselves like a
properly furnished house.
