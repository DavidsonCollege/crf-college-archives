At the regular meeting of the Philan-
thropic Society, Saturday night, the
affirmative of the question: Resolved.
That the American embargo to neural
countries is justifiable, was upheld by T.
N. Morton and E. R. Boney, who ar-
gued: (1) That the embargo was nec-
essary for self-preservation; and (2) that
neutrals have been selling our products
to Germany. The negative was defend-
ed by L. L. Wilson and W. C. Cum-
ming. Wilson contended that the em-
bargo was (1) unnecessary, (2) unlaw-
ful, and (3) unjust. Cumming defined
the embargo as a law forbidding the
shipment of certain restricted articles to
foreign ports, and argued for restriction
of exports rather than the embargo. The
decision committee decided in favor of
the affirmative.

Following this debate there. was an
extemporaneous debate between D. R.
Freeman and O. P. Hart. ‘The subject
was: Resolved, That Latin and Greek
should be required for an A.B. degree.
Freeman upheld the affirmative and
Hart the negative. The decision com-
mittee decided in favor of the affirma-
tive.

The society then went into the elec-
tion of marshals, and the following men
were elected: J. L. Fowle. chief mar-
shal; J. W. Clark, W. M. Currie, J. A.
Thames and. F. G. Lilly, associate mar-
shals.

Fumenean: The subject for debate
last Saturday night was: Resolved,
That the American embargo to neutral
nations is justifiable. The aflirmative:
composed of Hollingsworth, Burgess
and McGirt, argued (1) that it would
cripple Germany and thus bring the war
to a speedy close; (2) it would reduce
the high cost of living; (3) neutrals send
part to Germany.

The negative, composed of Harrell,
Brand and Craig, argued (1) it.is im-
practicable: (2) it is politically unwise ;
(3) it will mean a death-blow to our
trade in years to come; (4) it is morally
unfair.

Marshals elected from the Euménean
Societv were: Thomas, Flinn, Potts and
J. B. Woods, Jr.

UNCLE HIRAM’S TOMBSTONE
ERECTED DURING SUMMER

All who knew “Old Uncle Hiram”
will be interested to know that the tomb-
stone erected to his memory by the fac-
ulty and students was set up during the
summer.

The stone is of light gray marble and
stands eighteen inches high upon a base
twelve by eighteen inches. It bears the
inscription :

“Hiram Potts
1842-1917
Long a faithful servant of Davidson
College
Erected by the Faculty and Students.”

Beneath this inscription is the follow-
ing:

“His wife, Clara,
Died 1915.”

GOAL IS REACHED IN
PARKER FUND CAMPAIGN

The fact that the student body has re-
alized the eminence and worthiness of
the work of sacrifice and service that Mr.
Parker, ‘11, is doing in Korea, was evi-
denced last week by the liberal response
that was made in the canvass. The sub-
scriptions so far amount to $699.80.

This amount will be increased when all,

the subscriptions come in, and the rest of
the men are seen. At present there is a
great improvement over last year's sub-
scriptions, altho the student body — is
smaller than last vear by about ninety
students, Last year, out of a student
body of four hundred, only $590 was
subscribed; this year out of a) student
body of three hundred, $699.80 has been
subscribed and the canvassing has not
been entirely completed. One hundred
and thirty-eight dollars and eighty cents,
or over one-fifth of the whole amount,
has already been collected. “Vhis fact ts
almost an assurance that the amount of
$600, which has been pledged. will be
reached, tt is hoped that every man, as
aimember ut the student body, will feel
obligated to sign one of these cards, as
the student body is pledged to pay the
amount annually. It is also hoped that
the enthusiasm will not die down thru-
out the year.

GYMNASIUM FLOOR
HAS BEEN COMPLETED

Because of the rain last week the work
on the drain for the gymnasium was
necessarily slow, but the interior work
has. been progressing finely, “The main
floor is finished and will be ready for
use as soon as the poals have been
placed. The bannisters and porch have
heen finished and painted. The steam
heating installations will he completed
in about a week. The shower-bath rooms
are being tiled and made ready for use

SINCK MA SIGNED UP WITH
HOOVER.

The butcher's wagon isn’t seen so often
at our door,

‘The grocer’s boy does not come round
twice daily any more;

Our yvarden patch is flourishing, its truck

is in demand—

what we can't consume of it is

either dried or canned

Since Ma signed up with Hoover.

And

Upon our dinner table now there isn't so
much meat;

There's always bread a-plenty, though it
isn't always wheat ;

We spread the butter thinner, too, and
touch the sugar light—

For since we have begun the thing we
mean to do it right:

or, Ma's signed up with Hoover.

The kids are well and happy—they think
the change is great,

And each one tries to beat the vest in
cleaning up his plate.

All think the grub is splendid; and Pa
says he can see

He's not so fat and puffy as once he used
to be,

‘Fore Ma signed up with Hoover.

“For if we all are going to help our allies
win the fight,

We've got to feed ’em regular and got to
feed ’em right,”

Says Ma, “so we won't waste a thing
they will likely need,

And we'll make out on what is left and
have a splendid feed’—

So she signs up with Hoover.
_—Edward S. Jones, Newburg, Ind.

“De man dat ‘tends strictly to his
awn business,” said Uncle Eben. “‘some-
times don't git no credit 'cep’ foh bein’
unsociable."—-Washington Star.

SEVERAL JOIN POCKET
TESTAMENT LEAGUE

At the regular meeting of tie Minis-
terial Band Sunday evening, the presi-
dent, G. C. Bellingrath, '18, gave some
very interesting facts about ‘The Pocket
Testament League,” its origin and what
it is now doing. At the close of the
meeting an opportunity was given to the
new men, who were not members, to
join the league. Quite a number took
advantage of the opportunity.

At the next meeting the question,
“Shall a young man go directly from
college to the seminary, or drop out of

6 . aoe .
school for a short time?” is going to be

discussed. Several members volunteered
to discuss the different sides of this ques-
tion: however, everyone will be given
an opportunity to express his views.
