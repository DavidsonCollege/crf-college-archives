number one asset. We have an
outstanding relationship,” Knox
said.

“We mutually have had some
problems in that the college had
more students than they had dor-
mitories. I think that when the
college finishes the parking lot at
the sports complex, that’s going
to make life easier for us. r

We still have a lot of students
who park their cars in the down-
town area because that’s one of
the closest places, in some cases,
to class. [The students] go to
classes and stay all day.

I think that when that parking
lot is available it’s probably going
to be closer and therefore more
students, more faculty, more staff
will use that parking lot and free
up the desperate need for parking

overemphasize how important
the student is to the life of this
community.”

He believes that the people of
Davidson are a great asset, “I
think that we need to motivate
more people to participate in
public meetings when an issue is
being presented to the public.”

As for the town’s future, Knox
suggests that new projects such as
the Pine’s of Davidson Retire-
ment Center, the construction of a
walking mall, the building of a
new town hall, and the careful de-
velopment of a “gateway” along
the road from I-77 to the town
seem to be the type df change
Davidson has to look forward to.

And by the way, you can’t vote
for the mayor this fall. The elec-
tions aren’t being held again until
next year.

‘masterful |

By FRANK LORD
“Like Bonnie And Clyde them-
selves, the film rides off in all
directions and ends up full of
holes.”--Time, August 25, 1967

“Bonnie and Clyde is not only
the sleeper of the decade but also,
to a growing consensus of audi-
ences and critics, the best movie
of the year.”--Time, December 8,
1967

As you may haye noticed from
these two quotes | from Time
magazine, Bonnie land Clyde re-
ceived a somewhat equivocal
reception upon its initial release.
Since then, however, it has estab-
lished itself in the pantheon of
classic American films.

This film version of the story of
the Barrow gang begins with the
meeting of Bonnie parker (Faye
Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow
(Warren Beatty) and the start of
both their emotional and criminal
relationships. It continues
through their bank-robbing ex-
ploits, the formation of their gang,
and their eventual downfallat the

‘ hands of the civil authorities.

The plot itself would seem to be
fairly straight forward, but in the
more than capable hands of
Arthur Penn,the director, it be-
comes much more than a simple
just-the-facts documentary. Ulti-

mately, it isa comment on Amer- —

ica, its people, and, more specifi-
cally, the manipulative power of
film.

At its best, Bonnie and Clyde is
a tour de force of audience ma-
nipulation. Penn begins his film
