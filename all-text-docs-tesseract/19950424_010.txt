Cat Grimmell’s
play explores
the horror

and joy of
women’s First
Time sexual
experiences

By Emity Simmons
Staff writer

Written, directed, and pro-
duced by Davidson students,
The First Time by Davidson
senior Cat Grimmell was an
outstanding success. It cap-
tured the emotions of young
women everywhere and
brought them to life. A feeling
of intimacy was shared as each
young woman in the play re-
lated her stories aboutsex. Both
painful and joyous, the emo-
tions brought forward in the
play were true to life and drew
the audience in through the sen-
sitive portrayals of the charac-
ters.

Just as most young women
experience a first time, most of
them also have the experience
of sharing it with their friends,
confidants, or whomever. This
play reflected the experiences
of every woman in the audi-
ence through its characters and
their experiences. It also dealt
with the pain that many women
often associate with sex and
with the joy that it can bring.
Centered around a “first-time
party” given fora young woman
by her college friends, the play
moves through the stories of
each of the women’s experi-
ences with sex: being a virgin,
having a first time, a second

time, etc., and having the emo-
tions and reactions concerning
all of these experiences.

As each woman told her
story, a new issue about sexu-
ality unfolded. The experiences
of each woman were positive
and negative, as any sexual ex-
perience can be. Mary, a char-
acter with less sexual experi-
ence than the others, brought
up the issue of what happens
when alcohol is involved in in-
timacy, as did many of the other
characters. Charlette, a seem-
ingly cynical and unaffected
young woman, revealed that her
first time had been a gang rape.
These issues and others cast a
shadow on the experience of
Alex, the guest of honor, who
had just had her first time the
night before. Feeling guilty for
having described her perfect
first time, she did not know
how to react. She felt guilty
both for what had happened to
her friends and for enjoying her
experience.

At this point in the play, a
feeling of negativity toward
men was highly apparent —

Dancing in the daisies

By JAMES BERRY
Staff writer

What’s the most frustrating
time of the year for the students of
Davidson College? I‘ll give you a
hint. Imagine vibrant green be-
neath your feet, over your head,
and everywhere in between. Squir-
rels attack one another in a season-
induced passion to procreate. The
sun returns after a four month va-
cation. Why would this depress
anyone? Forevery sunny day there
exists a term paper, and nature
exists to tempt busy students. It’s
the picture of spring, but with sum-
mer still in the distant future, about
the only thing we have to look
forward to is free live music and
unlimited access to those velcro-
mitt-catching-things.

The music started with 900
Room veterans, the Arts Aware-
ness Ensemble. Having visited
Davidson before, they might have
expected a small crowd, but noth-
ing could have prepared them for
the pathetic number that showed
up at 3 p.m. on Friday to listen. At
the show’s height the attendance
never rose above 10 people.
Whether the low turnout was a
result of dedicated students getting
some extra work done before the
weekend (an uhlikely thought) or
simply a mass refusal to party so

early in the afternoon, the show
went on in style.

The songs were executed with
a characteristic groove. The tight
rhythm of the drums allowed the
bass a certain freedom over which
the guitarist set his off beat chords.

Vocals were traded among the bass-
ist and two keyboardists and were

strong on all counts. The only

gripe I had was one which encom-
passes all reggae music: there is a
standard format to the music and
rarely do the musicians stray from
this format.

Despite the lack of an audi-
ence, the band put on an active

show and started the Frolics nthe
right foot (albeit unobserved).

The next to take the stage was

Shannon Worrell, an exercise in
minimalism. The three-piece was
discrete but powerful. The drum-
mer had only a snare, three cym-
bals, and a tambourine. I assume
that I was oblivious to the small
drum set only because it fit the
music perfectly. The bassist looked

Crossing the Line and going

new Directions in the Black Box
Student-directed and performed plays deserve praise

By GEORDIE SCHIMMEL .
Staff writer

A good play is difficult to
praise. Applause wobbles un-
steadily from playwright, the ge-
nius behind the shape of the words
on the page, to performer, genius
responsible for the shape of the
words in the air, to director, genius
accountable for everything in-be-
tween. In the case of Israel
Horovitz’s one acts Line and Stage
Directions, performed Wednesday
and Thursday nights in the Black
Box theatre, applause quickly goes
to its natural mate. Actors molded
by the shaping hands of directors
are everything.

In less accomplished hands
Line would have been an easy play
to botch, with its wild crisscross-
ing of theme and wry commentary
on American institutions and es-
tablishments. It was not botched,
however, by the Davidson cast or
by Director Mary-Elise Brumfield.

Henry Ackerman, with mar-
velous wit, played the wonderfully
witless Fleming, accompanied by
Kay Walraven as profligate Molly
and Jose Ruiz as the obsequious,
soft-spined Arnall.
memorable were Jared Govan as
Dolan and Ben Luckey as Stephen,
the smart young Mozart enthusi-

ast. Line reaches its most disturb-
ing when Stephen, very much a
Stephen Daedalus rewritten for a
later year, is encircled by the oth-
ers waiting in a line for a baseball
game. As they chant “Boom boom”
with raised fists to Stephen curled
on the ground, he writhes from the
abuse. A very odd part but splen-
didly performed.

Line is an easy play to
misperform, but Stage Directions
is easier. With Stage Directions
Horovitz strips away all conven-
tion of dialogue — or dialogue as
most theatre-going audiences know
it; characters speak only their stage
directions. Because of the play’s
novel form, the impact of the spo-
ken line relies crucially on an
actor’s understanding of it. With-
out this intimate understanding the
spoken lines dawdle in the mind,
quickly expire, and foul up the
stage.

They did not do this. In fact
Sarah Hankins, Ben Summers, and
Annie Carr demonstrated an un-
usual amount of theatrical matu-
rity fora first-year cast, rarely miss-
ing a beat in the often frenetic
rhythm of the play.

Kudos to a brilliance debut by
Carr, the talented actress who
brought life and vitality to Ruby’s
suicide, and to Summers and

Hankins as well, who played a
distraught brother and sister with
such emotional fervor that one
wonders whether they are actually
related.

Horovitz’s plays impart the
immediate sensation of listening
to a conversation, or better, over-
hearing a conversation not meant
for other ears.

This is the beauty and the bril-

liance of Horovitz’s work, a beauty
easily lost if uncultivated or mis-
understood.

Both Josh Gaffga, directing
Stage Directions, and Mary-Elise
Brumfield directing Line knew this
as much as their well-chosen, re-
markable casts knew this.

Applause, then, to two of-the
mostremarkable and insightful the-
atrical performances of the year.
