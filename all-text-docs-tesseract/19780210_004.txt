Park commends Stuart —

To the Editor:

Reference is made to your editorial
on January 27, 1978, regarding the
Stuart Scholarships, ‘‘Why For Christ-
ians Only?”

Your concern for the equal opportu-
nity for all is commendable and not at
all surprising. However, there are
factors regarding this. scholarship and
others, which, I think, you should
consider in formulating your opinion...
or re-formulating your opinion.

“Restrictive scholarships’’ are not
new anywhere, and certainly not new at
Davidson. We have a scholarship
supplied annually by the Huguenot
Society for a descendent of that group
of American Christians which played
a big part in our American history. As
of next year, there will be a federally
funded program of scholarships limited
to men/women coming just from North
Carolina, indeed, some just from
Mecklenburg County. Also, scholar-
ships are available which are limited
just for pre-ministerial students. And
the Dana Scholars may come from just
the sophomore, junior, and senior
 classes—no freshmen allowed.

In effect, these are all exclusive.
Everyone of us cannot qualify for each
and every one of them. Yet, the donors
wished to help a student attending

Davidson; of all of the students at
Davidson they would like to help those
in situations particularly of interest to
them. None of these scholarships
excludes someone from attending Dav-
idson College; in each case the person
(even for the Stuart Scholars) must be
accepted at Davidson before applying
for the scholarship. What money goes
to which students is then decided based
on the various categories. The addition
of the Stuart Scholarships does not
mean that the pie is cut into smaller
pieces, it means the pie itself is made
larger.

The Stuart Scholarships do not say
that by their very being that non-
Christians should not attend Davidson.
What is said is that when Stuart
Scholarship money is applied to scho-
larships for those students admitted to
Davidson, please apply it to someone
who is a part of the Christian heritage

Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make
yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done,
whether you like it or not; it is the first lesson that ought to be learned;
and however early a man’s training begins, it is probably the last

lesson he learns thoroughly.

—Thomas Henry Huxley

To the Editor:
The time of year that newspapers
used to call the silly season has started

early at Davidson. Last Thursday.

night Prof. Bill Welch was “pied” by
two students in what I suppose marks
the unofficial opening of the campaign.
I'd like to make a few remarks before

’ further action occurs.

It’s a cinch that Bill Welch doesn’t
need any defense from me. I wonder,
however, if the students who found
such hilarity in their performance
realize that he is recovering from
serious ‘and painful facial surgery, or
that he has had corneal transplants in
both eyes within the past fifteen years.
Considering such, I wonder if they’ve
the guts to apologize to him.

But there’s another point here. The
men and women who comprise the
faculty and staff at Davidson are

professional educators. We work hard
to make a Davidson degree a valuable
commodity, and to make our college
community more than just a place to
learn. Among our friends are the great
majority of students, who understand
the value of community life, and who
know what an effort it takes to make it
work. Indeed, many of them are better
at it than we are. None of us should be
willing to tolerate those who see us as
targets for their personal amusement,
even on the transparent excuse that
money raised in the activity will be sent
to charity.

I hope we've seen the last of this
dangerous, stupid, and offensive prac-
tice,

Debate effort falls short

To the Editor:

In the course of last week I have
called on Mr. Schleiffer, who wrote a
letter to the editor on J anuary 27 in The
Davidsonian entitled ‘Schleifer Con-
tests Abagui’s Claims.” In his letter,
the author contradicted my column
‘entitled “Israelis Thwart Sadat Peace
Move.” He also accused me of ruth-
lessness..

However, I feel I have spoken as
honestly as I know -- backed by facts
and figures. Considering the heavy
convictions the author holds, I thought
we would be able to debate our
opposing ideas. I suggested we either
hold a public debate or a private debate
that could be reported to The David-
sonian by a neutral third party. I

reassured Mr. Schleifer that the one
hour debate would not take a personal
tone.

Since I am genuinely interested and
serious about the issue -- and thinking
him serious as well -- together, by
contesting our views, we might help
people take a stand toward one side or
the other. I tried hard but have failed in
getting Mr. Schleifer to debate his
letter.

I have respect for Mr. Schleifer as a
person, as a fellow student, and for his
undoubted dramatic prowess. But as
for his views on the Middle East, I am
afraid Mr. Schleifer has committed a
great Sin on behalf of this subject.
