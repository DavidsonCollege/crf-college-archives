Gross Anatomy serves up same old pop
film fare, but does it with a clever twist

By BENJY ORMAND

For the second time in his short
career, Matthew Modine has embarked
ona vision quest. The first time was as
a high school wrestler in Vision Quest,
being challenged to be the very best by
an attractive older woman and a seem-
ingly invincible foe.

This time, in Gross Anatomy, it’sasa
first year medical student aspiring to be
good doctor, challenged by his anat-
omy teacher and the attraction of a fel-
low med student.

This movie is quite different than
those which I have reviewed up to now,
in that it’s a pop film with little or no
redeeming social meaning. But, that’s
not necessarily a bad thing.

Gross Anatomy was a refreshing
change of pace. It is clever and enter-
taining and it has some neat twists
which makes ita good way to waste two
hours. But along those same lines, it
doesn’t do anything particularly new.

The movie serves to disengage the
thought processes of the audience, so
that once you become familiar with the
main characters you begin to identify
with them. I actually found myself at
certain points saying, “Wow! It would
be kind of neat to be in medical school.”

And that’s what I think these kind
of movies try to do, besides make big
bucks. So, while there’s plenty of cliche
stuff in this flick, it’s at least as good as
the standard fare.

A friend of mine who goes to a

hool in Boston told me-his experience

when he went to see this on opening
night. There were lots of students from
the Harvard Med program there, and
he said that they seemed well enter-
tained and that they liked it.

So that says to me that the movie
was credible. I mean, actual med stu-
dents seemed to think that it wasa faith-
ful representation of some of their tur-
moils. It works out to be one of the
standard’ mentor/genius-student
flicks. And if you like that, or if you’re
just planning to go to med school, then
go. You will have a pretty good time.

Rating: kx

Note: The rating scale which Iam using can
be interpreted in the following way.

> a is equivalent to something
which you should be willing to kill a dear
friend to see.

& & & & isa movie which is an immor-
tal classic, and yet not one which you can
ever remember when your friends ask you
what your favorite movies are.

a ¢ x is a film which should not be
missed, often because it raises so many in-
teresting questions pertinent to any viewer.

*#% is the standard rating, basically
applying to any flick which Hollywood
decides is good enough for the summer line
up or a several million dollar gross.

* means forget it; either someone just
dropped the ball while making it, or it was so
pathetic it should have never been made.

Zero stars is a special category. It
applies to only the very worst films; the kind
where you laughat the movie instead of with

it. This kind of movie you have to make jokes
about after you have seen it, just so your
friends don’t think you were a total idiot for
spending any amount of money on it.

So while technically, zero stars is a
worse movie rating than one star, I will take
exception in that a movie that got onestar at

least had a shot at being worthwhile. A zero
star movie isn't even really a movie—it’s a
two hour long joke. One star movies make
me madder, because they were trying to
pawn off a piece of junk as a real movie. I
hope that this aids you in deciding whether
or not you mu might go to a movie.

MAD magazine shaped modern
political cartooning and V.C. Rogers

By PAUL BARRINGER

The work of political car-
toonist V. Cullum Rogers
was recently on display in
the Union Gallery. A
Davidson graduate and for-
mer Davidsonian cartoonist,
Rogers worked: until re-
cently with the Durham
Morning Herald. Prior to
that he completed graduate

studies at the University of ~

North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. He is presently in
search of a job, having been
axed, as he told his audience
last Thursday morning, bya
zealously cost-conscious
newspaper accountant.

In his talk, Rogers out-
lined prevailing trends in
political cartooning during
the last few decades. He also
sketched his own career
pathasa political cartoonist.
He stated that the ‘50s wit-
nessed declining numbers of
political cartoonists. The
grim style of socialist real-
ism which characterized
most cartoons of that period
apparently frightened off
potential cartoonists.

Rogers cited three factors
which have significantly
contributed to the expansion
of the political cartooning
field in subsequent years.
First of all, the stylistic diet of

MAD magazine had cultivated
a sense of the absurd, counter-

ing the mainstream tendencies
ef such cartoonists as Her-
block.

Secondly, Australian Patrick
Oliphant, a particularly inven-
tive and prolific cartoonist, in-
jected new life into the cartoon-

ists’ stylistic vocabulary.
Finally, the events of the late
‘60s and early ’70s, the years of
Watergate and Vietnam, pro-
vided an immense amount of
absurd and insane material for
the cartoonist to work with.
Rogers stated that a continu-
ing problem with cartooning

involves the restrictions im-
posed on the cartoonist by a
newspaper's editorial staff.
He suggested that since the
numbers of small-town
daily newspapers have
shrunk in‘recent years, the
editors of the remaining
papers have been forced to
appeal toa broader cross-
section’ of the public.
Roger feels that this posi-
tion has increasingly
forced cartooning to be-
come less opinionated.
He stated, however, that
he had been fairly fortu-
nate in this regard, and
that his past positions
had allowed him a fair
degree of autonomy.
When asked for advice

for aspiring cartoonists, |

Roger remarked that it
was far better to tear up

one drawing and start the
next rather than to need-

‘lessly belabor a miscon-
ceived. attempt. ~

Another suggestion he

_ offered involved inten-

, tionally conjoiningsome- | _

~ what, disparate ideas.
Finally, and most impor-
- tantly, Roger stressed
. that any sense of taste
‘could only bea hindrance

to the . UP-and-coming.

cartoonist.
