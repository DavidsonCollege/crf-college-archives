‘Review of Davidson’

Published By College

“Views of Davidson” is a brand
new publication of the Public Re-
lations Department of the college.

Designed for general promotional
purposes and to be used as a supple-
ment to the catalogue, the book
will also serve as a unique memento
of the college. It contains forty
pages and presents 226 views of
Davidson. Artistically done in two-%
tone brown ink on ivory paper, it
is a graphic story of the college
past, present and future, whieh will
doubtless become a cherished addi-
tion to the library of Davidson's
alumni and friends. The book con-
trins almost no type except for
captions to the page and to some of
the photographs. ‘The front and last
pages are done in full color. The
cover is striking in gold and the
Tavidson red and black. It is being
sold by the college for 75 cents per
copy. The actual printing and en-
vraving cost is said to be 62 cents
