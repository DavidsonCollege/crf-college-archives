Beta Kappa, he would at the same time
realize how much Phi Beta Kappa means
io Davidson.

Some colleges have been playing for
membership for over one hundred years.
Davidson is the oldest male college in the
South in Phi Beta Kappa.

In the South only twenty-three colleges
out. of the forty in the Association of
American Universities have been granted
chapters of Phi Beta Kappa. This number |
of twenty-three includes Johns Hopkins, ;
Goucher, _ete., which are in a region that
some do not consider Southern.

The examination goes to the extent of
iooking into the records of graduates to sec
that they have done well in their fields,
examining the number of degrees the fac-
ulty has attained and making sure that
the student body has highest caliber.

After all this selection, about fiftecn
per cent of the graduating classes are elig-
ible fer this award. Hats off to the men
who make Phi Beta Kappa! They are in-
xi deed a select gang!

PHI BETA KAPPA

Every year, with very little ceremony:
the names of those person wio are award-
ed Phi Beta Kappa are announced in chapei.
~ Few persons on the campus realize that it
is the highest achievement that is granted
to Davidson students and the highest {¢
achievement that Davidson as a college has’
attained. Having a Phi Beta. Kappa
Chapter at Davidson means more than

; having a charter for any other one organ-
zation. To understand why this fact is:
true, one has to perceive the whole system :
of colleges and universities.

Conference that took action on the Uni-|

year.

create stimulation; adequate tests to insure effi-

— In these small liberal arts colleges some of the
