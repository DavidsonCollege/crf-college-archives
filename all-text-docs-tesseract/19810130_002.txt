Resident Advisor applications now available

By KEITH HEARLE
Staff Correspondent

The Housing Office is now
accepting applications for next
year’s Resident Advisor pro-
gram.

Applications are available in
the Housing Office and are due
February 9. Interviews will be
held after Spring break. Selec-
tions are made on the basis of
the interview, academic stand-
ing, and three references.

The RA program began this
year as a supplement to the
House Manager system. Two
RA’s from the junior and senior
classes live in each upperclass
dormitory. Their. job is to
maintain the physical appear-
ance of the dorm and to
maintain a livable atmosphere.

This year’s RA’s trained be-
fore classes began at the Col-

lege-owned cottage in Little:

Switzerland, located north of
Asheville.

The duties of the RA include
conducting room check-in and
check-out, attending weekly.
meetings with the Housing
Director, maintaining fire
equipment, enforcing housing
regulations, and counselling
students with roommate prob-
lems or other difficulties.

RA’s receive $100 per term
and deduct one half the double

Don’t despair, there is an al-
ternative to Slater: cooking for
yourself. With just a little in-
genuity and minimal effort, the
possibilities are almost limit-
less.

Since no meals are served on
Saaturday evenings on Patter-
son Court, several groups of
upperclassmen meet indepen-
dently to cook. One of these,
which calls itself the Davidson
College Dining Club (DCDC).
specializes in theme dinners,
ranging from a Hawaiian luau
to Christmas feast. The group
considers itself a full-fledged or-
ganization and even nominated
a representative to the Home-
coming Court,which says some-
thing about the importance of
good food at Davidson.

Sophomore Jeff Jordan, a
member of DCDC, said the
group consists of about five
sophomores with varying cook-
ing skills. Their differences in
ability can produce some inter-
esting results when one person
turns a job over to a less skilled
member. Jordan said one ad-
vantage of cooking is that the
meals don’t cost much—only
$1.75-$3.50 per week. In addi-
tion, group shopping is an
adventure.

He mentioned that a number
of cooking facilities are avail-
able. since most eating houses
allow members to use the kitch-
ens on Saturdays, and there are
kitchens in the basements of
both Cannon and Belk dorms.

“For the fun and the friend-
ship and the money, you can’t
beat it,’’ Jordan said.

Another group, the Cosmic

Cuisine Club, cooks at ATO
eachweek. According to soph-

room fee from their tuition bills.
The program has proved to be
effective in relieving some pres-
sure from the Housing Office,
according to Housing Director
Bill Bolding. The RA’s handle
complaints which normally were
directed to Bolding’s office.
The RA’s said they find
themselves under some con-
straint, however, because Da-
vidson’s housing regulations
are not as strictly defined as at
other schools, and because they
have seldom been effectively
enforced in the past.
Davidson’s RA’s said they
find it necessary to soften the
stereotyped image of a police-
like student who consistently
“writes-up” those who violate
iron-clad housing regulations.
The RA’s seek to handle
disciplinary problems them-
selves. It is sometimes neces-
sary to bring them to the
attention of the Dean of Stud-
ents, however.
The RA’s are peer counsellors

_and are available to inform

students about services offered
by the College. Bolding said
students have not often taken
advantage of RA counselling
because of the novelty of the
program. As the program con-
tinues, Bolding hopes more
students will seek the RA’s
advice.

Student cooks make hotpot cookies, sludge

omore John Krotchko, one per-
son fixes a speciality, some-
times ethnic, for the rest of the
six-member group. The decision
to have one person cook came
about after discovering that
while cooking together, some
people would follow the recipe
and others would dispense with
it, resulting in disaster. Now
that only one person cooks,
Krothcko said, ‘‘the method
may be a little bizarre, but it al-
ways comes out good in the
end.”

If, however, you don’t have
access to a kitchen, never fear.
Your room can be a marvelous
place to cook. Consider the case
of juniors John Siman and Dave
Banks, who-advocate cooking in
a popcorn popper. Their specil-
ities include sauteed mush-
rooms and a mixture of tom-
atoes, cucumbers, onions, moz-
erella cheese, and garlic.

Another of their inventions is
sludge, a repulsive-looking but
delicious drink. The recipe calls
for “teaspoon instant creamer,
1%teaspoons instant coffee, 1
teaspoon brown sugar, 1 tea-
spoon Nestle’s Quik, 1 teaspoon
butter, and one jigger dark rum
mixed together in the bottom of

Bolding said of the program,
“The RA’s have done an excel-
lent job this year considering
the fact that it’s a brand-new
program. I’m very interested in
attracting highly qualified ap-
plicants to continue to strength-
en and expand it into the new
dorms.”

Next year, Bolding plans to
invite speakers and hold semin-
ars in dorm lounges. The RA’s
will schedule and conduct some
of these events. Topics under
consideration include alcohol
awareness, planned parenthood
and job hunting.

Recently, the RA’s attended
a housing conference at Mars
Hill College. The RA’s from
Davidson, Furman, and Mars
Hill discussed various aspects
of dormitory life including the
prevention of damages, the
needs of woman students, and
leadership skills.

David Rhodes, an RA in
Little Dorm, said, ‘‘The job is
demanding, but I enjoy work-
ing with my residents. The
RA’s receive some good benefits
and develop skills which will
definitely help them after Da-
vidson.”’

This year’s RA’s are David
Rhodes, Peter Hairston, Bill
Dascombe, John Chung, Julie
Webber, Anne Guerard, Bruce
Wallace, and Keith Hearle.

a cup. Add hot water and stir.
Another possibility is the
trusty hot pot, which can be
used in a variety of ways,
ranging from boiling water for
tea to making cheese fondue.
Freshmen Stephanie Bruck,

Charlie Lovett, and I have
worked together to create such
dishes as chicken-curry and
Mexican-style beans in our hot
pot. ‘‘The real imagination ©
comes in the grocery store,”’

Lovett said. Since only one type
of cooking can be done in a hot
pot, canned foods are helpful. .
The correct combination of cans
is what makes good food. For

example, a can of chicken soup,
a can of muchroom soup; some-
canned chicken, a can of mixed
oriental vegetables, and liberal
ameunts of curry. The only
disadvantage to cooking in a
hot pot is that the tea just may
taste like garlic the next day.

Additional equipment like a
toaster-oven or a table-top grill
opens up more possibilities.
With a toaster-oven, almost
anything is possible, though my
personal favorites are Quiche
Lorraine and chocolate chip
cookies.
