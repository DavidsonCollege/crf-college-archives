Monitor Job Not
Always Taken Seriously

Monitors
Continued from page 9

posed to do things, but when you
consider you’re a student here and
live with the people you monitor,
you may adhere to the rules to a
personal degree that no other moni-
tor corresponds to. It’s like being
a judge. It’s amazing how-much
power they give you. The alcohol
violation slips give you the ability
to make someone’s life miserable,
both monetarily and socially. What
I try toremember is that people are
down there to have fun. I’m not
there to harrass them or not let
them have a good time.”
Anotheralcohol monitor, who
asked to remain anonymous, said,
“Maybe I don’t take my job seri-
ously enough, but I see it as letting
people do what they want as long
as I don’t find out about it. I think
the main reason I’m there is so that
the school can’t be liable for any
accidents. If I don’t see some-
thing, I don’t care. What I don’t
see, I don’t know. I mean, I’m
monitoring my friends! There’s
really nobody I’d give acitation to.
Once I was talking to a friend, and
the cop asked me to check his I.D.
Well, the cop left , so I didn’t write
him up. I’m your advocate. If you

break the rules without my know-
ing it, then that’s fine.”

Monitors agree that their jobs
would be much easier if they did
not have to give out alcohol viola-
tions. In fact, most of them have
only given out a couple the entire
year. Edwards feels that “if the
alcoho] monitor’s job was to watch
for the students’ safety, there
wouldn’t be as many problems.
Writing citations should be the
officer’s job.”

Despite all of the problems
that go with the job, most alcohol
monitors feel that it has benefits,

-also. Lopez 26 that “when I’m

at a party where one of my friends
is out of control, if I ask him to go
home, he’ll listen to me. I’m*his
friend and my job is on the line,
whereas if acop went up to him, he
probably wouldn’t listen.” In ad-
dition, Hinson says that “people
are going to drink, and this is one
way to keep them from killing
themselves.” According to
Edwards, “Being amonitor is hard,
and usually not rewarding, but it’s
a job that has to be done.”

Monitors do not see them-
selves as policmen, but after the
party , Lopez signs out at the Cam-
pus Police department and hands
in any violations he may have given
ut that night.

Application Process Well Under Way

Appplicants

Continued from page I
can applications rose from three to
four.

This fall Dr. Cable Wells and
her staff began small initiatives
which are beginning to show prom-
ise in minority recruitment. For
instance, they contacted the Col-
lege Board to obtain the names of
high achieving African American
students; a minority recruitment
brochure was designed; and first
year African-American students
returned to their high schools over
breaks to hold Davidson informa-
tion sessions. The Admission of-
fice has renewed its relationship
with Charlotte high schools. and
has begun to recruit minorities in

their junior year. Applications are

only one step of the enrollment
process, however. Following the
acceptance decisions the real chal-
lenge is “to enroll the best and
highest academic achievers from
the accepted pool,” commented
Dean Cable Wells. They are hop-
ing for 420 first year students to
enroll in the fall of 1993.
Toencourage the highest qual-
ity student to enroll, the Admis-
sion office has created a massive
yield project, all tobe implemented
between March 5 and May 1. It
begins with the acceptance packet.
This year accepted students will
also receive a letter from Dean of
Academics, Bob Williams, student
leaders, and regional admission
counselors. A copy of both the
Davidsonian and Davidson Jour-
nal will also be mailed out. Parents

are included by the Parents Coun-
cil letter they will receive. Current
Davidson parents and students
alike can participate in separate
phonathons to encourage the ac-
cepted seniors.

Besides external communica-
tion, the Admission office and
Davidson Ambassadors are plan-
ning Decision Davidson, for ‘
Saturday,March 27. This opportu-
nity will be a final personal invita-
tion to join the Davidson commu- °
nity. Accepted minority students

Witt-be invited to spend this week-

end.’

Dr. Cable Wells commends
both her hard working staff and the
faculty admission committee for
their assistance and involvement.
Davidson shall look forward to
meeting a gifted class of 1997.
