11

By STEVE BYERS

To paraphrase an ex-president,
you won’t have Steve Byers to kick
around anymore. With this column I
end my 12-month reign (some might
say “sentence”) as The Davidsonian’s
illustrious, elusive and_ invariably
esoteric sports editor. (And good
thing, too — I’m beginning to sound
like Ann Meador!)

I have so many memories from
these past 12 months that I have neither
the space nor the inclination to recount
them all here. But I can’t leave without
sharing a few of the most vivid images
that remain in my mind:

Scott Huie and I following the
leaders around Augusta National on
Sunday, the final day of the 1984 Mas-
ters. You couldn’t see much of any-
thing on the back nine, but just being
there was athrill.. .

Morgan Ward and I standing on
our tiptoes in the SRO section of
Centre Court at Wimbledon. For a sur-
prisingly cheap price, we were able to
see Jimmy Connors battle Paul An-
nacone in men’s quarterfinal play. We
had a good view of the action, but that
was almost irrelevant — here we were
watching Connors play on Wimble-
don’s Centre Court! I almost broke
down and had some strawberries and
cream, but the price allowed cooler

heads to prevail. . .

A few weeks later, Dickson Mc-
Lean, Stephen Bernhardt, Ed Hender-
son and I were in St. Andrews, Scot-
land, following Jack Nicklaus around
the rough and weather-beaten “Old
Course” for the third round of the ’84
British Open. By the end of the day, I
was so sure that Tom Watson would
win the tournament that I bet Ed, who
naturally chose eventual winner Bal-
lesteros, a beer on the outcome. If you
see him, don’t remind him. . .

Back at Davidson, I remember sit-
ting in the press box during football
games, being kept entertained only by
the witicisms and wisecracks of Dr.
Kazee and Coach Slagle . . . Another
poignant memory is the scene inside
the Wildcat dressing room after the
Wofford victory, where there were
few dry eyes but a lot of hugs, han-
dshakes and high-fives.

Other images of the last few
months: the feeling of euphoria and
disbelief I had at halftime of the David-
son-Wake Forest basketball game in
Charlotte, when the Cats led by 17
after dominating the first half. We
won’t discuss the next 20 minutes. . .
Traveling to Columbia with Jim Sow-
erby to watch the Cats, spurred on by a
raucous SAE contingent, absolutely
dismantle the Gamecocks, 77-61... .

Hunter Gourley wrote about skiing

in last week’s issue, but I’m here to tell
you it ain’t all fun and games on the
slopes. Especially if, like myself, you
can’t tell the difference between a
mogul and a goggle. The night we ven-
tured to Ski Hawk’s Nest — how shall
I phrase it? — it was snowing rather
hard, the wind was blowing with some
velocity and the temperature was on
the nippy side. We even had a wreck
on the way back, and to top it off, I saw
nary a “ski bunny” nor tasted nary a
“hot cocoa”. . ..

Then there was the time I went
bowling (only to procure a P.E. credit,
I assure you, lest you think I perform
this plebian activity regularly). As
luck — and let me emphasize the word
“luck” — would have it, I finished
with a 158 average over three games
and actually rolled a 195 in the last
one. Note: contrary to popular belief,
Statesville is not the steak house and
bowling capital of the world. . .

Well, before I close with some pre-
dictions, I need to thank some people
who have made my job a little easier:
tennis Coach Jeff Frank, soccer Coach
Charlie Slagle, ex-football Coach Ed
Farrell (a gracious man despite his
coaching record), Sports Information
Director Emil Parker (the power be-
hind the throne, I think, in the Athletic
dept.), Gerry Born, Jim McConkey,
Steve Soud and many, many others.

The sports staff deserves recogni-
tion as well, for they have had to put up
with my constant nagging, editing and
criticizing more than anyone. My
thanks to Huie, Gourley, D.D.
Wright, and Mike Adams. And, oh
yeah, Andy Barron, who’s going to
Tealize just how much fun this position
is in a few weeks. Think of Andy in
your prayers.

All right, let’s go out with a bang.
Georgetown will win the NCAA
Championship, Duke the ACC Tour-
nament and UT-C the Southern Con-
ference Tournament. Derek Rucker
will be first team All-Southern Confer-
ence and will win Freshman of the
Year honors in the league. The
Citadel’s Regan Truesdale will repeat
as MVP, followed closely by Gerald
Wilkins.

By this time next year Wilkins and
N.C. State freshman Chris Washburn,
who apparently doesn’t test well, will
be sharing a prison cell somewhere.
Dave Short will capitalize on his over-
night fame to write a bestseller /0/
Uses for a Megaphone. Marshall's
fans will challenge UT-C’s fans to a
cheer-off to decide, once and for all,
whose fans are the most obnoxious and
least pleasing to the eye. ABC will
telecast this event, but no one will
watch.

Furman Demolished, 42-9

By MIKE ADAMS

Davidson’s wrestling team stomped
Furman, 42-9, on Wednesday. “This
was a big win for us; we really needed
it,” said senior captain Mike Keely.

The Cats won all but two of the ten
matches against the Paladins. Freshman
Steve Lau started off the match with a
loss by a pin. Sophomore Mark
Wennberg opened the scoring for the
Wildcats, also with a pin. Junior Taylor
Simpson won by a forfeit.

Sophomore J.T. Lay registered a 5—2
decision over Furman’s best wrestler in
one of his finest performances of the

year. Senior Brad Essman scored a pin
and Keeley followed him with a 15—2 de-
cision. Keeley described his _perfor-
mance as “sloppy, but it’s a win.”

Scovall lost only the second match
for the Wildcats, 10-4, but the Cats
bounced back with pins*from freshmen
Tim Heinze and Doug Saintsing.

Saintsing said, “Pins are few and far
between in this league, and that makes it
great when you get one.”

Junior Andy Macary closed out the
scoring for the Cats with an 11-2 deci-
sion at heavyweight.
