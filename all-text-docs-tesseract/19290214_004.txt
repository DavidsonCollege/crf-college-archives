Alumni Council Acted
Upon Several Important
Matters On Last Monday

Motion Pictures of Campus and
Carolina-Davidson Football
Game Were Shown

MANY MOTIONS PASSED

Council Approved Plan of En-
larging Personnel of That
Body—Alumni Secretary
Will Submit Various
Proposals

One of the most important meetings in
the history of the Davidson College
Alumni Council was held in the offices of
Dr. J. P. Matheson, "99, in Charlotte,
last Monday night, with Dr. Hamilton W.
McKay, '06, president; Dr. Oren Moore,
08, Rev. J. C. Rowan, D.D., ‘04, Rev.
John McSween, '08, vice-president of the
association and president of Presbyterian
College, F. L. Jackson, '06, and Ernest.
Milton, ’26, alumni secretary, attending.

James C. Harper, ‘15, of Lenoir, came
to Charlotte at the request of the alumni
secretary, to show motion pictures whicl:
he had taken of the Carolina-Davidson
football game on Home-Coming Day, and
other campus scenes of Davidson filmed
at a later date. He had other rolls of
film with him, and showed some of them.

The secretary explained that the object
of Mr. Harper's visit was to show the
worthwhileness of investing in such equip-
ment for use at the local alumni meetings
throughout the country. The committee
discussed the matter, passed a motion ap-
proving the idea, but concluded that the
financial condition of the association
would not permit its present purchase.
They-expressed the opinion that it would
be an excellent idea of the college to in-
vest in such apparatus, and appointed
Messrs. Jackson and Milton to investi-
gate.

An enlargement of the Alumni Council
was next proposed by the secretary. He
tentatively outlined the constituency of a
council to include three representatives
from each class—the president, secretary
and one elected at large—and the officers
of the local alumni associations, with an
executive committee to operate similar to
the present council.

This question was extensively discussed
and universally approved as an acceptable

idea. The personnel of the council re-
ceived consideration from different an-
gles. The final action was a_ motion,

which was made and passed, that the
alumni secretary submit to the individual
members of the council, by mail, several
suggested plans of a larger alumni coun-
cil, and that after due deliberation and
correspondence discussion that the presi-
dent of the council call another meeting
for definite and concrete action.

A financial report of the condition of
the Alumni Association was presented by
the alumni secretary. Lengthy’ delibera-
tion followed which resulted in two mo-
tions, The first authorized the president
to appoint a committee to appear before
the budget committee of the board of
trustees and ask for an appropriation of
$2,000.00 for the alumni office in lieu of
the $1,000.00 which is now appropriated
by the college.

The second motion instructed the alum-
ni secretary to take up the matter of fi-
nancing alumni activity with all of the
local alumni association, and to inform
the officers that it was the consensus of
the alumni council opinion that it was
through them that the office would be
financed.

Brief consideration was given to the
nominating of officers and alumni trus-
tees, the names of whom would be sent
to the alumni on a mail ballot. Due to
the lateness of the hour definite action on
this was postponed, the president urging
the members of the council to have this
matter under consideration. The secre-
tary was instructed to send each man a
copy of the alumni catalogue for use in
making choices.

Boxing Tournament

Feb. 20th and 21st

All Classes to be Represented in
Meet

An Interelass Boxing Tournament has
been planned and the probable dates are
February 20th and 21st. It is hoped that
each class will be represented in each of
the seven classes. The classes are: Ban-
tam, 120 pounds; Feather, 130 pounds;
Light, 140 pounds; Welter, 150. pounds ;
Middle, 160 pounds; Light-heavy, 175;
Heavy, unlimited. All bouts will be lim
ited to three one-minute rounds. In case
of a “draw” one additional round will be
fought. In the case that*the participants
desire them, sixteen-ounce gloves will he
used instead of the ten-ounce gloves pre-
scribed by the Intercollegiate Rules. Any
man who is in fair physical condition
should be able to participate without any
fear of exhaustion. ‘

Medals in the form of gold chain
charms with the likeness of two boxers
superimposed have been ordered. These
charms have a ring attached for the usc
on a chain, These awards will be given
to those winning first place in each class.

A meeting was held of the principals
and “seconds” in the basement of Cham-
bers Monday afternoon for the discussion
of the Intercollegiate Rules and other
matters pertaining to the tournament. All
those wishing to participate should sce
Captain Pritchett and the others in charge
each afternoon at 4:15 for instruction and
help.

A meeting was called for all the boxers
of the Senior Class and a goodly number
responded to the call. The men in charge
of the entries for the Senior Class do
not wish to divulge any names at the
present time. There are several men
from this class who have had much ex-
perience in amateur boxing and they
should furnish plenty of competition for
the other classes. The Seniors are hop-
ing to enter a representative in each
weight class. It is sincerely hoped that
the other classes will follow in line with
thes Seniors and enter men in as many

weights as possible.

Cities Which Never Before Held
Meetings Will be on Itinerary
—Hundreds of Alumni Will
Be Reached

Two extensive alumni trips, with meet-
ings of Davidson men in ten different
cities in the south and east, being
planned by the alumni secretary for the
months of March and April, in addition
to numerous other short jaunts which
will call for meetings at practically every
point? where a local alumni organization

cluded cities where no association
been perfected.

The March trip will be similar to the
one of last spring, when new associations
were organized in Richmond, Va., Wash-
ington, D. C., and Baltimore, and when
the secretary met with the Philadelphia
alumni and the New York association.
Mr. Milton plans to extend the eastern
trip this spring to Boston, Mass., be-
cause of the large number of Davidson
alumni who are transient alumni as Har-
vard students. No association will
organized in the Massachusetts city, but
the object is to keep the contact with the
alumni while they pursue their studies,

In April the trip planned will be in a
semi-circle, to include meetings in At-
lanta, Ga., Chattanooga, Tenn., Nash-
ville, Tenn., and Louisville, Ky., with a
possible stop-over for another meeting at
Asheville. No association exists in the
Tennessee cities at the present time,
though a request has come to the alumni
office from Nashville for an organization.

Other points where the secretary
to. have meetings are Staunton, Va.,
Greensboro, Raeford, Fayetteville, Wil-
mington, Columbia, S. C, Rock Hill, S.
C., Salisbury, and at Laurinburg. The
latter city has no functioning organiza-
tion at the present time, and the object
will be to re-organize.

It is roughly estimated by the alumni
secretary that between 650 and 700 David-
son alumni will have an opportunity to
attend these meetings if arrangements
can be made for all of them.

“Y Cats” Lose Game
To Kannapolis Five

Kappanopis Five Wins Easy
Game From Davidson “Y”
Team

The Davidson “Y-Cats’ dropped their
second game of the season to a fast-play-
ing and close-guarding Kannapolis five
on the latter’s floor, The “Y’s” offense
was ragged, and the defense was easily
penetrated by the fierce passing attack
of the victors. Kannapolis seemed able
at will to pass the ball through the lo-
cal’s defense and ring up snow-birds. It
was their unfailing accuracy under the
basket that beat the hard-fighting David-
sonians. The “Y"” put up a great scrap,
anyway, and came out of the fray glori-
ous even in defeat. I Peeler and Gilliam
of Kannapolis proved the chief thorns
in the flesh, the former scoring 15 points
to carry off the high-point laurels of the
occasion.
