General Topic of Series as a
Whole Was “What Christ
Means to Me”

SPEAKS FOUR TIMES

Four Phases of Christ’s Life Taken
.Up in Talks

Dr. Robert E. Speer, Secretary of the
Southern Presbyterian Board of Foreign
Missions, concluded the series of
lectures sponsored by the Ott’s lounda-
tion, Wednesday morning, December 4.

The first of these lectures was delivered
at the Sunday Vesper service, while the
remaining three occupied the daily chapel
services.

The general topic of the series as a
whole was “What Christ Means to Me,”
in the form of a defense of Christianity
against current heresies, in accordnace
with the purpose of the Foundation, ‘The
specific topics for the four lectures were
as follows: “What the Earthly Life of
Christ Means to Me,” “What the Death
of Christ Means to Me,” “What the
Resurrection of Christ: Means to Me,”
and “What the Lordship of Christ Means
to Me.”

In the first of these sermons dealing
with Christ's earthly life, Dr. Speer
pionted out that “it provides an eve, pres-

and it presents this character as norma-

I most need an ideal and its correction
and inspiration, as is the matter of for-
giveness, purity, unseltishness, energy,
prayer, and the faith that spiriutal forces
are alone significant and determinative.
And I see Jesus’ method of imitation as
reasonable and right, outward according
to His way, inward according to His
mind, Supremely the life of Jesus reveals
the right adjustment of life toward God;
His own life was absolutely right and
His judgment infallibly true.”

In that lecture concerning the death of
Christ, Dr. Speer drew attention to the
following points: “It supplies a back-
ground of mystery so deep and so dark
that, set against it, our deepest and dark
est tragedies see clear. It is the symbol
and sign, and more than this, it is the
