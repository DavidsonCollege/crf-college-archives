Committee to forfeit 9
media representative |

By DONALD CALDWELL
Asst. News Editor
The Professional Affairs Committee (PAC) is requesting that the
College President appoint an additional member to the Media Board
rather than hold faculty elections for the post, as has been done in

the past.

The Constitution presently stipulates that two members be /
appointed by the College President, one be selected by the faculty,
three be chosen by the SGA and three more members from the
“College Community” be chosen by these first six.

PAC Chairman Brown Pat-
terson commented, ‘'The me-
thod for choosing a Media
Board Member is not mentioned
in the Faculty By-Laws, and
the committee concensus was
that a better alternative might
be to let President Spencer
appoint this member.”

*‘In this way, one person,
rather than a large group,
would be able t6 check on who is
really interested in the posi-
tion.”

Student Body President
Bruce Brown disagreed, ‘I see
no reason why they should
relinquish this responsibility. I
am more concerned with the role
of the Board than its composi-

He refused to talk about that
in an interview Wednesday.

But Academic Vice President
Price Zimmermann said the
half-million-dollar Vail Profes-
sorship “is really an honorary
thing” for the man who receives
it:

Instead of using interest from

~ the fund to give Bernard more
money, the college is acfually
taking away part of his salary
and is then going to replace it
with the interest.

Zimmermann put it succinct-
ly when he said, “‘At Davidson,

An official in the Develop-
ment Office denied yesterday
that he was trying to hoodwink

” Davidson's Trustees when he

set up otié-to-one encounters for
them with a few students and
professors last Friday.

But Special Resources Direc-
tor Julius Melton admitted the
‘group of students asked to
participate was not exactly
