DANCE « DA:ICE ! DANCE !

For those of you who were (un)
fortunate enough to miss the last
issue of this paper, it is my pleasure
to announce that there is to be a big
DANCE on the weekend of JULY 18th.

The dance is to be held on campus, in
fact, on the porch of the College
Union and due to the planning of Lucia
Lummus, Gwen Jordan, and George Kirk-
patrick it promises to be a good one,
The PEPTO.ES BAND is going to be here
plus a vast array of girls. Not only
will the bare essentials be provided
(Girls and Music) but also refresh -
ments and decorations that are being
planned by our co-eds,

Ed. note: For those of you who did
read last week's issue, I'm pushing
this dance because I feel it's going
to be a good one, So, plan to come
and bring your date, too, Naturally
things worth having are worth paying
for so —in order that those who are
skeptics will be relieved, the
dance is going to be a financial
investment on a break-even basis...
Tickets go on sale at the end of this
week; Stag 1.00, Date $1.50.

COMPETITION, I RECKON:

It seems there's a bit of activiy
going on down at the tennis courts
and up at the ping pong tables, I'think
Hog's a bit confused though, just saw
him heading for the tennis courts with
a paddle. Seriously, the TENNIS
TOURNEYMEN? (Brit. spelling) Began
today and the PIilG PONG TOUR. (wont try
this time) will reach the final rounds
near the middle of next week. Roughly,
this means that those what want to
enter better get on the ball, and those
what am already entered better get
down to playing. Be sure to consult
the Union Bulletin Board for times
and pairings. And the boys could use

some spectators, too,
