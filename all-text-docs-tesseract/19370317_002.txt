GROWING PAINS. .. Of particular interest
to people in this part of the country are the
growing signs of industrial unrest through-
out the nation. The Carolinas are the looms
of the South, and their mill owners will not
relish such manifestations as the current auto
strikes,

Apparently organized labor, like the camel
of the fable, now wants the whole tent. It
is no longer a question of reasonable hours and

; fair wages, it is a matter of monopolies. Will
the companies recognize CIO as the only bar-
gaining agency? Such attitude is unfair, un-
American. There are many workmen who
need the work, who for personal reasons can
not or do not join a union. To deny these
men the right of employment violates one of
the fundamental principles upon which our

government is based—it is little short. of
anarchistic. if

One ray of hope appears. Strikes usually

accompany prosperity. Men who are not sure

of their next meal wit hardly tisk-a job for

a mere matter of principles. like

GOLDEN GOOSE .. : We wish to protest the
action of a certain well-known Charlotte res-
taurant in installing a pay-telephone for its
customers. For years this restaurant has been
Davidson headquarters in the Queen City.
The phone was the chief: of many courtesies
which made students feel at home there, Es-
pecially during week-ends a large proportion
of the beanéries customers have been college
men, Yet by this one action the proprietor
endangers his college trade. Don’t kill your
golden goose, Nick! :

CHARLOTTE OBSERVER ... The staff of

help that The Charlotte Observer has rendered
by permitting our. using their cuts, mats, and
photographs,

The pictures of the sponsors for Junior
Speaking and the football action shots were
loaned to us by The Observer, They would
have cost us a considerable sum if we had
them made up. Thanks!

ELECTIONS... The annual spring elections
are here again. And we are glad to see that
politics is nil and no antagonistic groups are
forming. Davidson is free from politics and
we desire to sce that it remains free from

SPRING SERVICES... The Rey. Mr. Currie,
a Davidson graduate, is conducting the Spring
Services for this year, and we predict a most
successful series. One thing is essential to
make them a success and that is that we at-

messages.

RIGHT THINKING... “I guess college boys
are all right. Never went to college though.
Maybe that’s why I still have a high opinion of
college men.” Saucy words from swingy: Ina
Ray Hutton, baton-wielder of the Melodears.

Wake Up....

We recently came across an article entitled,
“Ts Radicalism Rampant on the American
Campus?” In “Collegiate Digest,” too, there
was a picture of students ridiculing “red
hunts.” The country seems to be under the
general impression that our schools are hot-
beds of Communism; and students all seem to
think that the other fellow’s school is shot

through with Bolshevism.

The shame of it all is that there is not more
radicalism on our campuses today. Students
show an extreme disinclination for getting
down to the facts of things, and an even more
apathetic attitude exists towards affairs of
national and world moment.

Although we can always work up a little
enthusiasm when some Yankee colleague yells
“Pooey to Hoey!” at us, when it comes to ac-
tually taking an interest in national affairs,
we fall pretty flat. An echo of student opin-
ion is the fact that only one editorial has ap-
peared in these columns all year on the subject
of peace (and that was taken from another
publication), yet the issue of peace and war is
one of the most acute facing the world today.
Some of us are of voting age, others very
soon willbe. It is only a matter of time before
the burden of this nation’s policies will rest
upon our shoulders. Yet we do absolutely
nothing to stimulate thinking upon such
affairs.

To take a perfectly-concrete_and_live issue,
consider the issue of pacifism. Most of us
have not given it a thought. Yet there are
organizations all over the country today at-
tempting to blot out this scourge which
threatens to wipe out the species. We can all
help in the good work by helping these or-
A great deal of legislation is go-
ing through Congress these days which has a
definite bearing on world peace and American
neutrality. Any of us could take five minutes
off a week to find out what the legislational
are, and another five minutes to
write our Congressmen and Senators what we
think of the measures.

ganizations.

measures

The most discouraging aspect of the whole
matter is that, aside from a lack of practical
attention’ to such problenis, we do not even
discuss them intelligently. We have not heard
one voluntary discussion on world peace in the
last two years. And when it is discussed, the
ignorance on what is going on about us is ap-
pallingly displayed.

Which is more important, to learn what is
being done to determine the authorship of
Shakespeare’s works, or’ what is being done
to promote international goodwill?

Campus Comments

Each year the Y. M. C. A. carefully selects
two ministers to speak to the Student Body.
They are not men whose names were pulled
out of the hat but specially consecrated men
who have been suggested by members of the
Student Body and were recommended highly
by the other ministers. Yet, five or ten per
cent of the Student“Body cuts during the spe-
cial chapel services and perhaps a fourth of
the students come to the evening meetings.
Does the Student Body feel that it is good
enough as it is and that there is no need to

change itself, both as a group and as. indi-
viduals?

Although the public services each day are
excellent it is usually the private conferences
that make the lasting impressions. As I un-
derstand it, the Rey. Mr. Currie will remain
here through Friday and Saturday, especially
to talk with anyone about anything, These
conferences are for us. Mr. Currie is a young
man, and while here at Davidson he was the
leader in Student Government, Athletics, and
Fraternity life.

Here is a man who has griped, criticized,
and reluctantly praised as only a Davidson
student knows how; but now he has had more
than a student’s experience and he can advise
us as could no outsider. There is not one of
us who has no doubts whatever, but we can
clear up some of our uncertainty if we talk
with some one who has had more experience
than we.

I am sure that no intelligent Davidson stu-
dent will say that he got nothing out of the
Spring Services. ;

the Varsity Debating Team, to write the next

Davidson politics are more insipid

an otherwise zestless situation. Mrs.
Grundy would not approve of sub
rosa agreements and the doubfe X,
and justly, but we don’t see why
she should frown upon open and
above-board combines and lineups.

We don't want the underhand
dirty work encountered in so many
collegiate elections, but we think a
more interesting set-up could be
organized without including the ob-
jectionable features. The situation
as it now exists seems rather pri-
mary and elemental, but even as it
is each fraternity is a combine with-

STOLEN THUNDER

_By DAYMOND TURNER

YOU TELL ’EM ...
You can tell a Junior by his high
and mighty air;

You can tell a freshman by his wide

and vacant stare;
You can tell a Senior by his caps

and gowns and such;
You can tell a Sophomore, but you

can’t tell him much.

APROPOS OF NOTHING...

Definition of nothing: A blade-
less knife without a handle ... An
Eskimo was sitting on a cake of icé
telling a story. When he finished,
he got up and said: “My tale is
told.” . .. It was a balmy evening
at the state insane asylum... Like
the chap remarked when his alarm

failed to go off at eight: “You
dumb cluck.”
-_ * *
REBUKE ...
Whenever we hear of someone

trying to run his neighbor's business

‘we remember the elderly lady who

one day accosted a well-known mo-
vie actress. The star was out walk-
ing with her pet, a chow dog. The
reformer sailed up to her and snap-
ped: “Young lady, it would be
MORE to your credit if you had a
baby over your arm.” “But, I’m not
married!” protested the dog fancier.

Painting her mug away.

A woman's best asset is a man’s
imagination . . . Some people cause
happiness ‘wherever’ they go;

some people cause happiness “when+

change without notice.

REGRET...

Before I heard the doctors tell
The dangers of a kiss,
I had considered kissing you
The nearest thing to bliss;
But now I know biology,
I sit and sigh and moan
Six million mad bacteria—
And I thought we were alone!

SHEEPISH ...
Little Bo Peep has lost two sheep ‘
And don’t want to find them.
Leave them alone and they'll come

home

Bringing a lamb behind them.

‘'ZAT SO?...

A soft answer makes no impres-
sion on a bonehead . . . When the
meek inherit the earth, according
to our present administration, they'll
have to give 26 per cent of it back as
inheritance tax ... It’s funny how
charity not only begins.at home but

Dr. and Mrs. J. W. MacConnell
Return From Stay in
New Orleans

Dr. and Mrs. J. W. MacCon-
nell have returned from a
wecek’s stay in New Orleans,
where Dr. MacConnell attend-
ed the post graduate medical
assembly. This meeting
brought together about five
hundred of the leading medical
and surgical men of the U. S.

Meetings were held morning, af-
ternoon and night and at luncheon
special groups assembled for round-
table discussions. High lights of the
assembly were papers on _ Skin
Cancer by Dr. Cannon of New
York who cautioned older people
against too much sun exposure and
also advised older..women to be
careful about excessive beauty par-
lor treatments which sometimes ag-
gravated skin cancers.

Dr. Dwyer of Washington, D. C.,
U. S. Public Health Service, spoke
on Typhus Fever which is trans-
mitted by the bite of a rat flea,
and on Rocky Mountain Spotted
Fever which is due to the bite of a
wood tick. In the laboratories they
had ticks sealed in jars and the
ticks had gone without food for
seven years and were still capable
of biting a person and giving them
fever.

Dr. MacConnell conferred with
some of the Davidson Alumni, who
were at Tulane Medical School and
reported that they were doing
well in their work. Seven million
dollars is being spent on improve-
ments to the Charity Hospital in
New Orleans. It is the second larg-
est hospital in the U. S.

OPEN FORUM

NUTSHELL
Ae (udid Fant

With elections in the air, and
with Junior Speaking only a few
days off, the Junior Class is about to
split its collective face, from ear to
ear. The class motto has become
“Keep Smiling,” and woe to him
who relaxes. Boy, will we be
grouches after the holidays! Thing
that puzzles us about the presiden-
tial election, though, is, who will
the boys (if any) from Maine and
Vermont cast their ballots for?
There’s not an avowed Republican
in the race.

The band gave a concert in the
Auditorium the other night that
was a pip. When they go to town
on the “London Suite” (“London
Bridge’ to you and me), Benny
Goodman isn’t even in it. Attend-
ance at the concert, though, just
brought out the truth of that old
saying, “A band is not without
honor, save in its own school.”
People all over the South and East
have payed a dollar per, and will
pay it, to hear the Davidson College
Concert Band, yet a free concert on
the campus hardly drew a handful.

The Colonial Riding Academy, re-

. Davidson elections have grown
lamentably tame in the past few
years! In fact we might say that
they are boring! Fair—yes. Free
from politics — yes. But also free
from any really vital interest. In
saying this we contradict the edi-
torial policies of this paper, but we
hope it may provoke some discus-
sion.

Campus politics, we mean hon-
est-to-goodness, open - and - above-
board, advertising, stump-shouting,
party-organized, vote-trading poli-
tics as practiced elsewhere can be
fun. Even if there is a little clean
mud thrown in. Yes, we see those
hands raised in horror even now.
We hear you protest: “Such things
have NO place on the DAVIDSON
campus.”

O, no, we can’t indulge; we are
better than bodies;
we must not appear to be office
seekers or partisans. Instead our
machinations take a subtler, our
politics become the art of getting
known or having friends who are.
That city, state and national govern-
ments are run on a different basis,
that we might gain here experience
in citizenship which might be val-
uable in after life does not occur!
Open politics would afford an edu-
cation, at the same time a world
of fun.

This is neither a reflection on the
elected or the also-rans. It is aim-
ed at no student body administra-
tion past or future. Its sole purpose
was to make you mad. Did it? If
not, why?

The Red and Black Masquers
(who, incidentally, claim that the
Junior Class is stealing their stuff
with Friday night’s masqued ball)
are casting about for a new play
for their spring opus. They have
shied off front “Winterset” because

it requires sets and actors. Of
course, they might get the sets,
BUT ... Our suggestion is that

they follow up their success with
“A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by
presenting more Shakespeare. Say

“A Comedy of Errors.” They
wouldn’t even have to try!

Speaking of Shakespeare, the

Bard of Avon had some little-sus-
pected powers. He might even be
described as a hog-caller in reverse.
Here’s what I mean:

A very old and very close friend
of tnine, who grew up with O. Hen-
ry in Greensboro, once told me that
when the two of them were boys,
my friend was delegated to spend
his nights in his father’s watermelon
patch during the summer, to keep
prowlers away. O. Henry, young
also, was accustomed to stay there
with him. One night William Sid-
ney Porter, as O. Henry was known
then, arrived late, and left the gate
open behind him. A pig walked in,
and made straight for where the
melons were the largest. My friend
insisted that Porter must remove
the beast, as he had let him in.”
The author-to-be, never over-ener-

getic, decided that a less tiring and
more original method than merely
chasing the pig must be arrived on.
Accordingly, he approached the an-
imal, and began to recite Shake-
speare at him, Writer and rooter
viewed each" other for some min-
utes, and then the recitation began
to sink through into the porker’s
head. He gave one snort; Porter
raised his voice — and the pig got
up and swiftly ran away! He even
(here my friend smiled, and I took
the finis with a grain of salt) shut
the gate behind him.
