Job as Clerk.

JOINED ARMY IN 1928

Staff Feels Fortunate in Get-
ting Neely

The staff of the R. O. T. C.
department here was increased
by one Sunday when Sergeant
Clarence C. Neely arrived in
Davidson to take over his new
job as clerk, Sergeant Neely
comes here from Atlanta
where he was recently re-en-
listed in the service. Before re-
enlisting he was stationed at
Anniston, Ala.

The military department feels
that it is fortunate in having the
sergeant stationed here. He spent
a year at Central State Teachers
College in Oklahoma, is a graduate
of the Army Finance School, and,
in addition, holds a commission of

second lieutenant of finance re-
serve.

Sergeant Neely has been in the
army since the year 1928. He has
spent most of his service at Fort
Benning, Georgia, where he was
first a member of the 29th U. S.

Infantry and then of the finance
department. He comes to Davidson
highly recommended.
the past the
Davidson staff has been in need of
an additional member to care for
increased responsibilities résulting
from enlarged enrollment in the R:
O. T. C. courses. With Sergeant
Neely taking charge of the clerical
duties, the work can now be more
proportionately distributed.

It is hoped that Sergeant Neely
will enjoy his residence in David-
