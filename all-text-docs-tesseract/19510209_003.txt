THE DAVIDSONIAN

Hang Your Hat NEW PROFESSORS GRESHAM AND HAYWARD REPLACE
PRODIGALS CAPTAIN JOE MARTIN AND DR. EBERHARDT

At Hugos

By NAT DANIELS

The dignity of the United States
Post Office has been grossly in-
s Led by the audacity of certain
we'l.mean'ng but befuddled author-
ities on the campus of Davidson
College, and we, in a sense of pa-
triotism and respect for the kindly
Uncie who protects us all, demand
an apology and some action.

In the plans for the new Student
Union, the administration and ar.
chitects have seen fit to remove
the student mailboxes from that
magnificant marble facaded struc-
ture on Depot street and place
them in the Student Union, a typi-
cal Davidson conglomeration of
the old and the new, and it immed-
iately behooves us to see to it that
a congressional committee be ap.
pointed to fully investigate the!
matter and in the light of the fol- |
lowing report, indict the institution
named above for Contempt of Post!
Office.

There are three main reasons
which wt shall discuss, which re.
fute from all practical points of ;
view the wisdom of moving the
mailboxes.

First, it would lower consider-!
ably the amount of mail received
by each student each week. How
would it feel to look into oar mail-
boxes and actually find them empty
when usually as the situation now
stands, there are loads of letters,
cards, etc, in each box. How could
we get along without reading every
day that the “Encyclopaedia of
Sexual Truths” is now at a new
low price of $3.98, that the J. W.
Woods Seed Co., has developed a
new type of spinach, that Bahia’s
is having a clearance sale in lingerie

or that there will be a square dance | Hamilton W. McKay, a former Da-

tonight in the Mt. Mourne gym.
What would the typical Davidson-
ian do without this amazing com.
pilation of pertinent information at

his fingertips. Would he resort to|

the library and read Life or the
New York Times—heaven forbid
for with such self-degradation and
consumption of misinformation and
propaganda, one of the facts of
the true Davidsonian’s spirit
would be utterly destroyed.
Second, the new student union's
location is another decided disad-

THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH—New members of the college faculty: Mr. Bryan Gresham,

campus.

sponsibility and makes concessions
to it he will continue to have free-
dom of action. But when he neglects
this duty it will be compelled by
law.

Dr. McKay places the responsi-
bility for the preservation of free
medicine squarely on the shoulders
of the docfors and says that they
can win the fight for free medi-
cine with hard work, sacrifice and
devotion.

“Above all else,” he states in
conclusion,” it means that liberty
is possessed only by those who
earn the right to be free and em.

In November of last year Dr.

vidson student now practicing in
Charlotte presented the President’s
Address to the Southern Medical As.
sociation which was meeting in
St. Louis, Missouri. This address
appeared three months later as the
lead article of the Southern Medi.
cal Journal. Somewhat later it ap.
peared again as reprints in various
parts of the country.

The reason that this speech had
been so widely read stems from the
fact that it discusses frankly and
intelligently a problem or rather a

vantage which would be brought] situation that has built up between
on by re-location of the student | the people and the doctors. The sit-

after chapel when wading for such
a short a distance as the old gym
would be uncomfortable instead of
exciting.

Last, but not least, can the col-
lege afford to install in the Student
Union a mail dispersal unit con.
structed with the efficiency which
is one of the earmarks of our fine
post office. Can we afford to pay
the hundreds of clerks, operate
and maintain the electrical sorting,
stamping and postmarking equip-
ment, keep the grass cut on the
front lawn, and all the other con.
veniences, such as cuspidors and
free taxi service which the United
States government has so kindly in-
cluded in its Deficit Spending Pro.
gram for small college town post
offices.

And so, fellow students let us
rise up and fight with all the
strength we can muster the social-
istic form of mail distribution which
we are being forced to accept, for
convenience sake, if for no better-
founded reason, for the old Post
Office is much closer to the bum-
ming corner and much, much more

Literary Efforts

Not Uwrewarded

Four writing awards are avail-
able each year to members of the
Davidson student body. Two are
open to all members of the student
body: the one-act play contest,
sponsored by the Red and Black
‘Masquers, and the Vereen Bell
award for any type of creative
writing. This second award is spon.
sored and judged by the staff of
the college magazine, Scripts ’n
Pranks. The other two awards are
limited to smaller groups of con-
testants. The Willa Cather award
is given to that member of Sigma
Upsilon, National honorary literary
fraternity, who composes the best
literary ‘work of the year. The
third award is presented to the win-
ner of a freshman creative writing
contest, available only to members
of the freshman class. This con-
test is also sponsored by Scrips 'n
Pranks.

pointing out that although Ameri-
can medicine has made great pro.
gress it is being weighed in the
balance and found wanting. There
seems to be something radically
wrong between the people and the
doctors, and three areas are sug-
gested in which immediate begin-
nings toward improvement should
be made.

Tht first area is education in
the art of human relations. Many
doctors fail to take an interest in
community affairs and try to re-
main aloof from their duties as
citizens. In the business end of
his work a doctor is often at a
loss as to -how to organize an of.
fice or keep books.

Another area is in professional
self.dicipline. Courts of medicine
should be set up to deal with in-
dividuals who practice neglectful
and slovenly methods.

The last area is in the medical
practice acts which in many states
permit doctors to carry out pro-
cedures, operative or otherwise, for
which they are neither trained nor
competent.

The purpose of the address as
a critique on American medicine is
well done and although it is not too
thorough it is probably true. Dr.
McKay brings into the speech,
somewhat obliquely, a thrust at so-
cialized medicine in which he brings
out the point that if reforms are
not made by the doctors them.|_.,.. , .

Student Poll Reveals
No Tears For War

The University of North Caro-
lina student body is convinced now
that cherished plans for the next
few years are gone with the wind
of a third world war, and most of
them, including a lot of the more
mature co.eds, expect to be in
some kind of uniform before the
next 12 months have ended.

This, says the issue of Look
magazine released Tuesday, sum.
marizes the attitude toward the
draft it found on the campuses of
four representative colleges, Cali-
fornia, Northwestern, Princeton and
North Carolina. The vast majority
2 students, the article reveals,
would prefer to serve in the Navy
or Air Force. The Infantry and
‘Marines are regarded as “having
mighty little future.”

puses, and not much flag waving

Two new professors have come
to the Davidson campus this semes-
ter to fill the vacances caused by
the transfer of Capt. Martin to the
R.O.T.C. department and the leave
of absence of Dr. Eberhardt. Pro- |
fessor Bryan B. Gresham, Jfr., has
taken a position in the mathe de-
partment teaching trigonometry, al-
gebra, and refresher algebra. Dr.
Harold D. Hayward, who is com-
muting between his home and Da-
vidson three times a week, is teach-
ing in the Bible department.

Although Professor Gresham is
proud of the fact that he was born
in the mountains of Western North
Carolina (Asheville), he likes it to
be fully understood that he has
lived the better part of his life in
the nearby city of Belmont. Five
days after he graduated from Bel-
mont Abbey Junior College, he

marr. started a career under Uncle Sam
~ that was to last thirty-three

eS months, As a_ field artilleryman,

*< professor Gresham was carried to

Europe and later to the Philtipines.
* Upon his discharge from the Army,
‘he decided at first upon an engin.
jecring career and entered N. C.

State, but later changed his mind

to math and transferred to the

_ University of North Carolina. Af-
—~y oleer graduating from the university,
_£ lhe did some graduate work there
and became a part-time instructor.
He is a member of Pi Mu Epsilon,
honorary math society, the Elisha
Mitchell Scientific Society, and Tau
Beta Pi honorary engineering fra-
ternity. It was: from this «part-time
instructorship at Carolina, that he
came to Davidson.

Professor Gresham said that it
was much too carly to state opin.

Debate In Tourney

The name of Davidson College
was carried into hitherto unex-
plored territory during the past
week by two of its. debators, Jack
Hunter and Pete Kalogridis, who
attended the Azalea Debating Tour-
nament in Mobile, Alabama.

This tournament was sponsored
and conducted by the Portier De-
bating society of Spring Hill Col-
lege, beginning Thursday, Febru.
ary 1, and ending Saturday Febru-
ary 3. Twenty teams attended, rep-
resenting approximately eleven col-
leges and universities, ranging from
Notre Dame to Kansas State.

decision, one by forfeit, and lost
three, being eliminated in the last
day of the tournament. Victories
were over Milsapp, Mississippi
State and Kansas State; defeats to

other teams of Milsapp, Kansas
State and to Wichita.

The topic was: “Resolved: That
the Non-Communist Nations should

tion,” By the rules of the tourna.
ment, each team is required to de-
bate both affirmative and negative

Cop had found Johnson's shoes
and hat in Watts, and used these
as additional. evidence. I.eaving his
shoes at the entrance of a_ build.
ing which he plans to rob is a
“trademark” of Freddy's.

He was partially identified by
Brown whose testimony, when ad-
ded to the positive. identification
by Cop Linker, proved to be suf-
ficient evidence for conviction.
Brown's wallet was also found in
Johnson’s home.

Monday afternoon Johnson was
taken to Charlotte and the County
Recorder's Court with a charge ‘of
first degree burgary, a capital of-
fense in North Carolina. From
there he was bound over to Super.
ior Court where he may be sen-
tenced to life imprisonment.

On December 5, Johnson was ap-
prehended by Eddie Adams in
Georgie Dorm. He pleaded inno.
cent, and was released by Adams.

Johnson was granted a five year
suspension of an 18-20 year prison
term under the conditions that he
would (1) hold a steady job for
five years, (2) refrain from the
consumption of alcoholic beverages
and j(3) stay completely away from
the college campus. In his earlier
youth, he had been taken into cus-
tody for petty theft and had served

terms in the state reformatory.
