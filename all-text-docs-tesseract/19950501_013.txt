Bang a drum, slurp some squid,

and hug a tree (for a buck)
Davidson celebrates Earth Day ‘95

By GEorpDIE SCHIMMEL

How many of you have ever
heard mostly-conscious musicians
playing on thrift-store bought pots
and pans and old plastic water jugs,
the kind with the ribs? How-many
of you have embraced, face to face,
a tree that needed a shave? Per-
haps the more revealing question,
how many have paid to embrace a
tree? How many of you have eaten
squid still wriggling from the sea?

Earth Day rolled around again,
and Davidson met it full face to
celebrate behind the Commons last
Thursday. During lunch, scantily
dressed students milled around
eating their lunches, tossing sun-
dry projectiles back and forth, vis-
iting the various theme booths, and
nodding to the intriguing music.

One might say that the musi-
cians tied the event together (ev-
eryone heard the same noise), but
one wonders, pursuing the anal-
ogy, what they’d use for string.
Dysfunctional phone cords? Their
cymbals were old pots and pans,
their drums water jugs and oil
drums,or what closely resembled
oil drums, sort of an odd thing to
display so blatantly on Earth Day.
Though their lyrics might send the
more conservative scholars of po-
etry sprinting to the bathroom hold-
ing their mouths shut, one’s got to
applaud them for their courage.
Can you imagine singing those
rhymes? In public? And if there’s

Symphony

concert. Virtuosic piano soloist
James Swisherelectrified Love Au-
ditorium with his rendition of
Edvard Grieg’s Piano Concerto in
aminor. Maintaining a facade of
simplicity, Swisher dazzled the au-
dience with his amazing technical
ability. Furthermore, his intensity
radiated through his dramatic arm
gestures and animated face, aseach
and every listener transcended into
a state of complete absorption.

Coupled with the rich orches-
tration, his passionate piano melo-
dies created an unforgettable mo-
ment. The first movement startled
the audience with explosive en-
ergy and an incredible cadenza,
while moments later, the second
movement brought tears to their
eyes. People hovered on the edges
of their seats, lingering on every
musical moment.

After the final chord, one could
sense a short caesura of silence in
which people regained normal
breathing. Shortly thereafter, Love
Auditorium was filled with the
overwhelming sound of people
leaping to their feet and joining in
the standing ovation. The people
who attended the concert were
privileged to hear a performance
that some said they would never
forget.

something to be said for sheer
weirdness and ingenuity, this band,
The Billys, will soon top the charts.
Anyway, all of it was great fun.
But the band was, after all, a
small part. There were of course
the booths/eventtables. One could,
if so inclined — and a surprising
number seemed to be — write let-
ters to conservation agencies and
purchase some fairly attractive
nature t-shirts, all the rage; learn
where, how, and why to recycle
(haven’t we been through this too
much already?); hug the only
known Quercus sapiens in the
world and for only for a buck; and
try one’s hand at trashketball, ru-

‘Mored to be the fastest-growing

sport in the nation, definitely in the
next Olympics. And in the last
booth, ice cream and perhaps the
most potent lemonade in North
Carolina waited free for anyone
not completely satisfied by Com-
mons cuisine. (The squid was,

actually, aless popular booth which
dissolved very early in the event.
The wriggling from the sea part
was ajoke. These were only store-

bought squid.)

And now arrives the part where
one gives the event the hard sell.
But that is becoming very much a

bore. It was Earth Day, we cel-
ebrated it. No one told us what to
do and so we did it ourselves, not
searching for some congratula-

tions, not looking for any nods of
approval, but ourselves. For our-
selves. There’s something very
reassuring about that.

Eating disorders. Body image. Sexuality.
Gender relations. Sexual assault. Feminism.
Career and family.

Global women’s issues. If you want to
discuss these issues and share good food and
great company, come to the Women’s Issues.

Committee meeting tonight at 8:30
in the Big Screen Room.
