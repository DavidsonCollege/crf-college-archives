In a lovely gesture of retaliation,
students of Salem College enter-
tained at a softball game at their
school in Winston-Salem last Sat-
urday evening. Those present were
members of the Davidson College
student body and a few friends.

The guests of honor were dressed
simply but effectively in blue or
yellow wool bow ties, the gifts of
their hostesses,
only favors given.

These were the

mony of greeting in which the
guests were herded into a walled
enclosure patrolled by a _hand-
picked group of amazons and ad-
dressed with a smile of glee by
Miss Frances Carr, who announced
that the activities planned for the,
evening were, in her estimation,
quite well suited for the program
of Salem-Davidson day in order to
express the thanks of the Salem
student body for the treatment: ac-
corded them at Davidson-Salem day
last fall. The hostesses then lured
their guests into a gulch behind
the school quaintly termed an ath-
letic field, removed their shoes and
cloaks, and enticed the -nsuspect-
ing visitors out into the open field
to play.

Outstanding personages present
in the game were Mr. Lewd Newd
Tate, of Davidson and Morganton,
who graciously consented to coach
from the sidelines; Mr. Bill John-
son, of Davidson and Cornelius,
who saw considerable action on the
mound; Miss Betsy John Forrest,
of Winston-Salem and New York,
who skillfully caught during most
of the game, handling capably
everything offered by the David-
son pitching staff; and Mr. La-
marr Williamson, of Davidson and
Arkansas, who held down !eft field
from a novel position behind a
small bush. After the game. Wil-
liamson and his date remained be-

America’s favorite sport. Also out-
standing during the game were sev-

were led over to tables by their

lawn and each was covered with a
white lace cloth and centered with
a platter of fried chicken flanked
gracefully with sprigs of celery.

After supper the Davidson stu-
dents were entertained in the var-
ious dormitories by their dates, and
later in the evening those who
so desired attended a candlelight
dance. Music was provided in the
form of a record of Heartaches by

Ted Weems.

author, Miss Molly Darr, of Win-

week by the rising Senior Class,
Jim French was elected on the sec-
ond ballot to serve as head cheer-
leader for the 1947-1948 sports

second ballot.

until March 10, 1943, when like
many others, he.was called into the
Army. He served first in the Coast

fantry and went overseas in Sep-

Crowded Auditorium
| Hears: Arnall Speak

By David Gambrell

Tuesday night, April 22, former
Governor Ellis Arnall of Georgia
“talked” in Chambers auditorium
as the last speaker in the 1946-
1947 lecture series at Davidson,
Governor Arnall in the last
three months since his “retirement”
been on a lecture tour that took
him to thirty-two states. His ad-
dress was typical in that most of
his lectures have been delivered in
colleges and universities, for he
believes that, “The hope of the
world is in the young people.” He
has astounded the nation with his
humor, intelligence and ability and
his earnestness and optimism for
economic and domestic betterment
in this country.
Meets Georgia Students

Soon after his arrival at David-
son, Governor Arnall held an_in-
terview with a delegation of stu-
dents from Georgia in the lounge
of the Y. M. C. A. Thirty or more
listened intently as he answered
questions concerning his career and
more specifically the present po-
litical situation in Georgia. Admit-
ting prejudice, he stated that the
Talmadge faction was ‘caught
stealings“and were “thrown out.”
This situation, he said, is typical
of conditions-imposed by such fac-
tions all over the South. Neyer-
theless, he assured them, groups
like the “Bilbo-Talmadge axis,”
which appeals to the poor and ig-
norant, are on the decline and the
South will soon take an equal posi-
tion with the rest of.the country.

that other parts of the country had
“greatly misunderstood (the South)
in-every- way.” He places a large
part of the blame for this on pub-
lications in the East, which “play
us down” in an attempt to please
their readers. He has devoted a
great deal of time recently toward
improving understanding through
his lectures and his articles in na-
tional magazines,

Though he did not give a title
to his lecture of the evening, it
might well have been called “The
Place Where We Stand is Holy
Ground.” It was a message on how
we can maintain world peace by
making ourselves worthy of inter-
national leadership. “The world
today,” he began, “is moving fast.
We have not time to look back but
we must look forward toward keep-
ing the peace. This cannot be done
with armed might nor by making
war more horrible than it now is.”

“The U. N. O. is a good basis for
peace,” he said, “yet, actually, it
depends on the minds and hearts
of the people of the world. Since
we fared better than any other
country from the war, we ought
to take a major role in international
leadership. We must promote just-
ice, righteousness and good will
throughout the world. If we want
a better world we can have a bet-
ter world; it only takes will and
courage in the hearts of men.”

respect, we must first improve

must equalize economic conditions
throughout the nation. This will
require the efforts of all of us.”
Governor Arnall put forth a five
