Players, coaches, and fans who have fol-
lowed the Davidson women’ s volleyball team
this year will tell you that it has been a roller
coaster season for the Wildcats. Streaks of
brilliance one match and shades of inconsis-
tency the next have plagued the team. Never-
theless, players still feel that they have a
chance at capturing the Southern Conference
championship.

This past week illustrated the ’Cats’ (7-9,
4-4) problem of unpredictability. Davidson
reclaimed a .500 record in SoCon action with
a convincing 3-game win over rival Appala-
chian State University, but not before falling
to both North Carolina A&T and East Ten-
nessee University earlier in the week.

In the team’s closest match of the season,
the Wildcats lost to the North Carolina A&T
Aggies, 30-28, 31-29, 31-29. If the close loss
wasn’t enough, Davidson broke a six-year
winning streak against A&T, pouring the
provefbial salt on the Wildcats’ wounds.

In the second game of the match, junior -
setter Nicole Tonelli spiked the ball for a 29-
23 Davidson advantage. Amazingly, how-
ever, and to the dismay of the Davidson
home crowd, N.C. A&T managed eight con-
sécutive points to steal the game.

In game three, Davidson once again had a
game point at 29-28, but the Aggies were
relentless in their drive to defeat the team that

has dominated them for so many years, even-
tually succeeding, 31-29.

round, though, the

and extended their
seven match win-
ning streak to
eight.

Despite the
ETSU loss, junior middle blocker Roberta
Quis confirmed that team morale remains

high.

“We weren’treally disappointed,” said Quis,
“because everyone on the team played well.
Our freshmen are stepping up.”

The team’s confidence was evident the next
day, as the ’Cats registered their most domi-
nating performance of the year with a 30-24,
30-26, 30-20 win over in-state rival Appala-
chian State.

After winning the first game easily, head
coach Tami Darwin’s squad found itself in a
hotly contested game two, trading points for
the first half of the game. From 19-17, how-
ever, the ’Cats never trailed again, eventually
clawing their way to a 30-26 victory.

The decisive game 3 was all Davidson. The
team led the entire game, even doubling the
Bucs score at 24-12.

In the match, Rebecca Teichgraeber °03
and Jacqueline Ortega ’02 each pounded nine
kills, Tonelli served up 28 assists, and Quis
registered 13 digs. The team’s defense also
shone, holding ASU to a lowly .031 hitting
percentage. Jennifer Ortega ’03 contributed
to the defensive effort with seven blocks.

After four consecutive losses, Quis said, “It
felt really good to play the way we did. All the
pieces came together, and our strengths hit
their weaknesses.”

When asked about a third straight SoCon
crown, Quis responded, “We’re improving
every game. We’re going to have to work for
it, but we definitely have a chance.”

Duke scored again in the first eight minutes
of the second half, increasing their lead to 3-

The Davidson women’s field hockey team
met its toughest competition of the season as
the ’Cats faced No.13 Duke University last
Sunday in Durham, N.C. Stuck in a winless
five-game. tailspin, the Wildcats started the
game strong, seemingly matching the Blue
Devils in both ability and control.

For the first twenty minutes, the tough
Davidson defense held Duke scoreless. “We
really played well the first half,” said fresh-
man Jane-Garnet Ishon. ““We kept pace with
them and dominated by playing our own
game.”

With 13:11 left to play in the first half,
Duke University freshman Johanna Bischof
found the back of the net for the first time off
of an assist from senior Artgie North. A
second goal followed shortly, and at halftime
the Blue Devils were up 2-0.

0. Four more goals followed in the second half
to pad the Blue Devil lead in the 7-0 win. The
game was Duke’s fifth shutout of the season
and Davidson’s sixth consecutive loss.

The Wildcats had 3 shots on goal, and
freshman goalie Cate Schenning registered
13 saves. Davidson’s record is now 4-7.

Schedule changes were recently announced
for the women’s field hockey team. Games
against Vermont on Oct. 12, Holy Cross on
Oct. 15, and Maine on Oct. 16 have all been
canceled.

However, a postponed conference match
has been rescheduled, and Davidson’s next
game will be this Wednesday, Oct. 10 against
Radford University in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Game time is 9 p.m The match will be an
important one, as the Wildcats are on the
prowl for their first conference win of the
season.
