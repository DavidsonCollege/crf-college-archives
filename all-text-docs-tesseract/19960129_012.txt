Cosmic Coffee
misses the
stratosphere

By Jacop ABRAHAM
Coffee Critic

A friend recently told me about
a certain Mormon. university at
which the pleasures of nicotine
and caffeine are outlawed. As a
willful addict of both cigarettes
and coffee, I was aghast. The very
thought made me grope for my
lighter and rush right over to the
latest addition to Davidson’s Main
Street, the Cosmic Coffee House.
Unfortunately, I quickly real-
ized that I need not have thought to
bring my trusty Zippo. Cosmic
Coffee fits right in with the rest of
the quaint shops on Main Street —
another hide-out for the eco-
friendly yuppies of the 90s. As far
as I’m concerned, a “no smoking”
signin acoffeehouse might as well
read “go home college creeps.”
The typical Cosmic Coffee
Connoisseur is a late twenty-or-
thirtysomething who likes to sip
espresso and nibble on biscotti
while pondering great literature or
the folly of politics. Five or ten
years ago, a place like this would
have been ahaven for disillusioned
college misfits who like to wash
down their angst with black java.
However, if you like to relax
in a place where the air is as sani-

tized and bland as the atmosphere,

_ Cosmic Coffee is for you. Here

you can sample the exotic lunch
menu (foccaccio — so European!
so hip!) and ignore the adult con-
temporary music while admiring
the quirky, trendy art soon-to-be
decorating the walls.

Atmosphere aside, youcan get
a damn good cup of coffee here,
especially if you go for the fla-
vored kinds. The standard varia-
tions on plain old coffee
(cappuccino-espresso-mocha-
latte-crappe) are pretty much what
you would expect, and you can
mix and match them to suit your
taste.

The light pastry and sandwich
fare, also a prerequisite for the 90s
coffeehouse, complements the
coffees well and makes for a nice
lunch when you want a change of
pace.

But if you’re looking fora real
coffeehouse — the kind of place
where Flo the waitress fills your
cup without asking and teases the
horny truckers — leave your
Birkenstocks at home and head
straight for the nearest Waffle
House. You'll find me in the cor-
ner booth with the cancerous cloud
above my head.

know at that age that I was hearing
David Bowie’s crisp British narra-
tive over Sergei Prokofiev’s play-
ful orchestral composition. What
do kids care about technicalities? I
imitated the Bird’s sing-song voice,
chirping “Allis quiet! Allis quiet!”
I sighed with relief when the Duck
came back to life as the Duck An-
gel. And most importantly, I en-
vied Peter’s courageous capture of
the wolf.

Senior Davidson Dance
Troupe member Carrie Harris also
remembers the magic of Peter and
the Wolf. Inspired by ahigh school
production of the piece, Harris tack-
led the task of choreographing her

own rendition of Peter and the .

Wolf for Davidson’s troupe. It is
Carrie’s intention that proceeds
from the production will be do-
nated to the Ada Jenkins Center to
enable the purchase of new calcu-
lators and encyclopedias for their
tutoring program.

The story of Peter and the Wolf

is set in a fantastical woodland
landscape. Peter, played by Har-
ris, lives with his grandfather (Mary
Elise Brumfield) in the forest. The
Bird, the Cat, and the Duck (played
by Shannon Simmons, Sarah
Holden, and Erin Steffensmeier)
joust and frolic together, often with
Peter as their companion. Until
one day, echoing the grandfather’s
warnings, an evil grey Wolf (Laura
Leibfreid) enters their domain. The
other animals shiver with fright,
and even the hunters (Sandra
Symes and Brooks Chappelle) are
frozen with fear. But not valiant
Peter! He succeeds in catching the
Wolf by the tail with a lasso made
of rope, earning the admiration of
his grandfather, the woodland ani-
mals, and even the Wolf!

Harris’ rendition of Peter and
Wolf brought the tale we all imag-
ined as children to life. Her chore-
ography captured each animal’s
personality and character, leaving
the audience spellbound.
