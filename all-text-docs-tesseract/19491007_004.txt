PHI GAMMA DELTA

The chapter really looked great
last Saturday in the free-for-all
held against the Salem varsity; al-
though penalized rather frequent-
ly for illegal use of the hands, the
boys from Delta Kappa came
through with flying colors. Out-
standing for the locals were pledge
brothers Bob Struble and Christie

odds, fought gamely on "tit the

There were both sorrowful good-
byes and sighs of relief when the
buses left Davidson Saturday night
for Salem College. Chuck . Mann
was ‘very vocal in his sigh of re-
lief. Lewis Nelson didn’t say much
nor did he react very enthusiasticly
over his cute Salem date. Glenn
Eddington said “Oh, she was all
right.” Frank Wallace was heard
asking the distance from Davidson
to Salem. Joe Griffith had his own
Florence Cole down to Davidson.
The brothers enjoyed her singing
and piano playing. They also en--
joved saying gooybye to her while
Joe waited anxiously. Tom Abel
dated a friend of Florence. He did-
n’t have much comment of her.
How was she, Tom?

John brought Joyce to the game
and Bill also brought a “friend”
‘along. We were also glad to have
Homer Zedaker with us for the
weekend. “

Bill Calhoun, an alumnus, drop-
ped down the Friday before the
Army game. At midnight he, John
Caltioun, Bill Brooks, R.’ B. Cov-
ington Bucky Long, Marshall
Dendy, and Paul Laverty left for
Michie Stadium. Needless to say,
they never made it. However, they
did pick it up on the car radio.
They did make it back to David-
son by 9 p. m. Sunday. How dumb
can you get?

Speaking of traveling, Morgan,
Grissom, Hamilton, Jackson,
Brooks, Norwood, Laverty, Best,
et al, were seen heading north on
Highway 21 last Friday night. Mis-
sion was accomplished; however,
Ben had to stay up until 4 a. m—
I would suppose to make up for
the library time he lost that week
end.

Apperson, what is out at Queens?
He has been seen there quite fre-
quently this year. What would
Sarah have to say aboyt this. Tom,
Harold and Dotg are also’ very
well known at Burwell. Beatie must
think that Queens has something
because he is still trying his “luck”
in spite of his recent experience
there.

The Sigs played a great game
Tuesday against the Phi Delts.
They lost 6.0 to a good team in
the first game of the year. It looks
fike our team will give the best
teams in the league a lot of com-
petition, Everyone looked good
for the first game, but Ben Hamil-
ton rates extra praise for his out-
standing play in the Phi Delt game.
Good luck in the Kappa Alpha
game Friday.

UN sign off with a word of wis-
dom to Phil Davis, “Silence is a vir?
tue, especially in the company of
upperclassmen.”

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

Down at Minerva’s lodge this
week the SAE's have centered all
their attention on trying to train a
good pledge class and to develop
a winning football team ‘far this
fall's Intra-fraternit) competition.
The pledge trainer this year is
Bro. Billy Pate, and he gives prom-
ise of a good pledge group if we
all cooperate with him and all goes
well, Pledges Dick Kelly, Max
Morrison, A. C., Gregg: Kent Glo-
ver, Jimmy Jameson, Harold John-
son, and Vernon Clifton are ‘all on
the Freshman football team and
we hope to hear more from them
‘in that position later on in the au.
tamn.” Pledge Bill Bledsoe is on
the Freshman Tennis Team and
-we hope that he can hold a position
in that highly competitive sport.
Pledge Kennet Smith is among
other things a musician as we
were proud to note at the David-
son-Salem Day’ — a musician in
the Grand Ole Opry style, which
is the only style! We are hoping
that when more of the extra-car-
ricular activities get under way,
more of the pledges will come up
with talents and accomplishments
for us to write about. .

Bro. Bob Milar is trying té whip
the purple and yellow pigskin

packers together, and the prospects
so far look good. The first game is
Wednesday with the Phi Gams;
this game will give us a chance to
really see if Bro. Lain Cloaninger
can center; Bros. T. C. Coleman
and Bob Bennett cah catch a pass;
if Bro. Lamar Hinson can really
get through that gap between
guard and center as he says
he can; if Coach Milar can really
play quarter back and operate a
smooth’ offensive team; and if the
Minerva ‘brothers really have the
spirit that they should have. We
cannot win them all without win-
ning the first, so we hope that all
will be on hand for support and en-
couragement. Last year it took us
two or three games to get started
but we hope this will not be the
case this year.

Plans for Homecoming aré being

made on all sides, so don't get

left ~- if you don’t have a date,
get one. and if you don’t have some
ideas for decorations then start
thinking it over.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

Brother Russ Grant and nearly
all the other brothers, using Fan-
joy’s show cows as an excuse, ran
up considerable mileage over tow-
ard Statesville this week. We still
wonder why Russ never talks of a
bull yearling anymore, but of some
cow named Fifi that he saw there.

Congratulations to Van Story
Sifford, Lee Talbert. Osborne, and
Grover Lee for the good ball they
played this week end. No doubt
they will have better luck next
week end with State. Grover says
we would have won if he hadn’t
been stood up by his girl and the
coach. J think he’s making another
try this week end.

Getting around to the event of
the latter days, many of the broth-
ers had beautiful dates on the cam-
pus. Gordon Scott and Ed Deni.
son had two mighty pretty dates at
supper Saturday along with Cam-
eron, Obefon, and Jeff Wood.
Bobby Joe was seen with his
charntihg bride-to-be, happily
spending one of his last bachelor
days. Others who had girls at the
game were Marky, Warlick, Furr,
Cooper and Bill Boyd. Amos
wouldn't bring his “friend” down,
but he reports he had a fine time
in Mooresville.

Brothers DuBose, Mills, and
Seawell couldn't find anything bet-
ter to do than to sit around all
week end. Sunday afternoon, Russ-

(Continued On Page Five)

It has been said of certain per-
iods in history that nothing of any
great importance really happened.
People lived and died; kings and
presidents came and went; the wind
and the sun and the rain continued
to wear away the land, sweeping
the bits of rock and sand and the
good rich to low places in the
land or down the racing rivers to
the sea. But politically, there were
no catyclysmic upheavals; cultur-
ally, no great awakenings; econo-
tically, no major changes.

To say that the present time is
one of tremendous importance is
only to be banal. Constantly we are
told that this is a period of great
moment and deep significance. So
many times have we heard this
that some, at least, are becoming
afraid of the frightful, terrifying
importance of our times and are
longing for the tranquil days of
yesteryear when life was free and
gracious, when every move was not
one whose implications might well
be earth-shaking, and when a man
could live and die untouched by
the hurrying mad pace of today.

But the seeds of today were
sown yesterday, sown in the tran-
quil days of yesteryear when life
was free and gracious. An era does
not spring full-blown from nothing.
It is not a discrete part of his-
tory. It, like all living things.
has a heredity which determines
what it can and cannot do. Those
halcyon days of yesterday saw
a seed planted. The sced sprouted,
throve, grew into a_ philosophy
rink, tenacious, and highly inimi-
cal to the things, we as a peaple,
have always held dear. And = the
one unique thing about this philoso-

phy is that it did not, doesn’t, and:

probably will not reveal itself for
what it is. It is an insidious thing
and it has permeated the mind and
thought of our people as silently

The Reserve Officers Training
Corps Battalion of Davidson Col-
lege has reached a new high in
enrollment. Col. Ballard stated that
the enrollment for this year is 472
men as compared to the former
high of 450 men reached in 1946.
The present enrollment includes
214 Freshmen.

Because ‘of this increased enroll-

the first time composed of fi
companies and a band, instead 6
the four companies which it has
had in the past.

Col. Ballard further stated that
the curriculum for the R. O. T. C.
course tias been enlarged this year
with the addition of several new
subjects. However. the drill period
will remain unchanged. Because of
the large amount of material to be
covered this year, the drill periods
will be used to cover new subjects
in the event of rain.

This summer the members of the
Senior Class in R. O. T. C. attend.
ed a training camp at Fort Ben-
ning, Ga., for six weeks. While at
Fort Benning, they won the inter-
collegiate rifle trophy for firing
the highest score. The Davidson
Seniors were in competition with
at least fifteen other colleges. Ca-
det Eart Huie fired the highest
score in camp, 196 out of a possible
200.

Cadets Charles Parker and Al-
lan Fanjoy won the camp doubles
tennis championship at Fort Ben-
ning, also.

In a special order issued from
the R. O. T. C, Headquarters of
Davidson College on September 15,
1949, the following men were ap-
pointed to command positions:

THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Henry E. Hansen’

but as..surely as a fog invades a
City.

The reason for this unique char.
acteristic is this. At the time of
the inception of this philosophy, its
influence on the actions of those
who believed in it was honest;
that is, their promulgation of the
concrete expressions of its prin-
ciples was done in the sincere be-
lief that it was best for the coun-
try. The philosophy itself being
false, its effect on the people was
evil. And they came to oppose any
reversal of its principles. not sin-
cerely and honestly as they had
done, but for selfish political rea-
soifs. Thus this philosophy, in-
herently evil, has corrupted both
the politician and the general pop-
ulace: And since this effect is mu-
tually interacting, the corruption
caused by the philosophy has pro.
ceeded by geometric proportions.

What is this philosophy? The
answer can be given most succinct-
ly. It is the idea that something
can be had for nothing, that free-
dom can be enjoyed without its
inevitably accompanying respon.
sibility. It is an extremely attrac-
tive idea and would be an extreme-
ly desirable one were it true. Un-
fortunately, it is tot, and, equally
unfortunately, the American peo-
ple have displayed an increasing
insensibility to the fact that it is
not’ true.

The seed of this philosophy had
to exist before it could be planted.
To find the seed of such a philoso.
phy is not difficult. Always there
are those members of a society
who are little short of parasites.
Ostensibly, at least, these para.
sites profess to believe in equal op-
portunity for all and to admire
those who have reached the top by
their own efforts, In actuality,
they envy these “doers” who have
had the initiative to better them-
selves» would rather be fed and
controlled by an outside agency,
and long for the downfall of those
who. have succeeded where they
have failed. Such men are always
with us. And they are clever. For
they know that these “doers”, the
ones they envy or despise, need
not be killed or banished to se-
cure their downfall. There are oth-
er ways, equally effective, of pull-
ing those above them down to their
own ignoble level:

This seed had to be planted be.
fore it could grow. In 1932 a new
president was elected. It was he

the hearts of the people. Thus was
philosophy given concrete ex-
pression and the diseased pollen of
its flowering, like some mysterious
vapor, has confused the minds of
millions, has corrupted those who
once were pure.

This seedling had to be tended
before it could flower. How was it
tended? When Franklin Delano
Roosevelt assumed office the coun-
try was in the grip of a great de-
pression. The people were frighten-
ed and willing to try any expe-
dient to restore the former level
of prosperity. The true solution to
their problems lay at hand. Hard
work, sweat, and tears, then as
now were the only good solutions
to a_ situation which, however,
brought about, had practically par-
alyzed the economic structure of
the country, To a certain extent,
the people cannot be blamed for
not taking this proven way out of
their dilemna. For it is a hard way-
a hong and difficult way. And when
poverty is staring a people in the
face it is hard to think of the ul-
timate; the immediate assumes an
exaggerated importance, and Roo-
sevelt’s solution, though lacking
courage and evil in its subsequent
effects on the mind and philosophy
of the people, then appeared ideal
in every way. How, then, did
Roosevelt tend this philosophy, this
idea that one can get something for
nothing, that the government can
assume all the responsibility while
the people have all the freedom?
Five measures will be used as ex-
cellent examples of how Roosevelt
did this. These measures were set
forth at the beginning of his ad-
ministration as cure-alls, panaceas
for the ills of the country. They
are: 1. the support of farm prices
and the subsidization of submargi.
nal farm groups: 2. the establish-
ment of minimum wages and the
systematic promotion of labor or-
ganization and higher rates of pay,
3. the redistribution of income by
steeply progressive taxation, 4.
permanent relief for unemployed,
incapacitated, and the aged, and a
social sectirity program, and 5, the
‘use of public credit and of the fis-
cal machinery to offset the stag-
nation of private enterprise and
to stabilizé the economy and main-
tain employment at a permanently
high level.

These measures were the cradle

rr LD

=

THE PASSING OF ‘AN ERA

of the new philosophy. What is sc
evil about them, so inimical? They
seem workable ideas, yes, even
good ones.

They seem benevolent and kihd.
How have they harmed the people?
Are they malignant?

One thing must be said before
answering the question above. The
depression which elected Roosevelt
and made these measures the law
of the land was imdoubtedly ar.
evil occurence. It was an indica-
tion of irrefutable nature that the
system which once had flourished
was now sick. But system, like
an individual, cannot always be
well. Sickness is as inevitable to
an economic system as it is to an
individual. The amount and type
of illness will depend, of course: on
the heredity, the estock”, so to
*speak, from which the system
comes. And a system can always
be well only when it exists under
arificial conditions,.when it is con-
tinually propped and bolstered and
given shots in the arm from with.
out. History has taught us that
these statements are axiomatic,
true, by their very infallibility to
occur in the past, It might be add-
ed that our system, prior to 1933,
had been well much more than it
had been sick; had given. us, as a
people, more than any other sys-
tem has ever given any other peo-
ple. But these measures of Roose-
velt were not aids to restoring the
system to health. They were, and
are now in their present greatly
augmented fornt. dopes, depres-
sants, poisons which could not fail,
ultimately, to kill the roots of dem-
ocratic life. And: it is only due to
the basic excellence of our system
that it has so far been able to with-
stand the continued onslaught of
forces violently inimical to it. Far
from making the sick well again,
Roosevelt’s measures could only
end in killing it. They were at-
tempts to set up another system
completely different from the one
which had been. Is an economic
system so different that it, like a
horse with a broken leg, must be
shot? Is it not worth while to try
to make well the system which has
served us so efficiently in the past?
The answer is obvious.

Now to a consideration of the
five measures. It is important to
keep in mind that each, one has had
‘a dual effect. Each has tended to
‘harm both our economic system
and further to develop in the people
the idea that something can be had
for nothing. And titis dual effect
is mutually interacting, for each
tends to increase the other, which
in turn, further augments the for-
mer, °

1. The support of farm prices
and the subsidization of submargi-
nal farm groups. There is nothing
inherently wrong in helping a per-
son when he needs help. But thix
help must not be a permanent
thing. When it assumes this char-
acter of permanency, the individ-
ual no longer wishes to improve
his own condition by his own ef-
forts. He comes to depend on the
help which is being given him, and
finally begins “to regard it as his
right to receive such help. Thus
his character is undermined. For
it is a basic Christian principle that
help must be designed in such a
way as to aid the individual in help-
ing himself, not in making him a
stave to that help. When it does
the latter) the individual’s true in-
dependence has been taken away
from him. For freedom cannot be
had without responsibility. When
the responsibility passes to the
hands of the government, the trce-
dom of the individual goes with
it. Economically this measure
would be all right if a measure
guaranteeing the profits of indus-
try accompanied it. But no such
measure exists. On the contrary,
while the prices farmers receive for
their products and the wages la-
bor receives for its work are main-
tained by law, industry was not
allowed to raise its prices to cor-
respond to these increases and,if
“he present administration has its
eway, will again not be allowed to
do so. In addition to this, exorbi-
tant taxes are imposed on indus-
try to help pay for the artificial
bolstering of farmers’ prices. In-
dustry is consequently “taken”
coming and going.

2. The establishment of minimum
wages and the systematic promo-
tion of labor organization and high-
er rates of pay. In the days of the
individualistic, ruthless “captains
of industry” it was perfectly evi-
dent that labor needed protection.
Ta raise wages and thus secure
a better standard of living for la-
bor was good for alt industry as
well as the worker since it pro-
vided a larger market for the pro-
dacts of capital and labor. But the
process has been carried too far.

Is The YMCA Alive?

By J. J. Murray, Jr.

fulfill its mission as a vital force

in campus life? In attempting to

‘get a line on such a far reaching

question, I have tried to cut a cross
section of opinion on the hill.
Here you will fiud reflected a doz-
en bull sessions stretching from the
Y itself, through the domitories,
and ‘down to fraterpity court.

An outstanding feature of most
of these is

informal discussions

‘how little the average student ac.

tually knows about the organization
and its scope of activities. Did you
know, for instance that the stu.
dents both control and support the
VY? It is a fact that the student-
elected members of the Board of
Control, which is the final authori-
ty in matters pertaining to the
YMCA, have a potential voting
majority over members from the
faculty and administration. It is
also true that a large percentage of
its funds are obtained from the
student activities fee paid by cach
student at the time of his regis-
tration.

Lack of information is respon-
sible for many misunderstandings
of the ¥ program concerning what
it is and is not supposed to include.
Responsibility for this publicity
failure lies partly with the student
body but to a greater extent with
the leadership of the Y. A five-
minute chapel talk by each of the
commission members does not give
a man a complete knowledge of
the YMCA’s work.

One of the commonest criticisms
which I encountered in almost ev-
ery bull session, was the antipathy

Does the Y.M.C.A. at :

? created by what is commonly term-
ed the “holier-than-thou” attitude
of some of the Y leadership. In
past years this has been at times all
too true. Glancing over the roster
of leaders for. the coming yeats
however, will show the most near-
ly representative group of men in
many years. If the Y is to receive
full cooperation from the student
body, the secretary and future
presideats must continue to secure
efficient and acceptable leadership.
When asked what the Y needs
most in its program, many stu-
dents say “more ping-pong and
pool tables.” Although obviously
not the most important items in
its program, recreation facilities
certainly merit consideration. These
are at present entirely inadequate,
limited as they are by lack of
space. Plans are now under con-
sideration which would convert the
old gym into a student center. Here
would be housed the campus pub-
lications, the honorary fraternities,
the student store, and the YMCA.
Under such a system, the office
of the Y secretary would be the
logical point of coordination for
all student activities. As the center
of student life on the campus, the
Y. would be in a position to give
far more effective service to the
college in this field. This perhaps is
one partial answer to the question
of increasing the value of the YM
CA as an effective force for a bet-
ter Davidson.
Editor’s note: This is the ‘first
ot a series of constructively criti-
cal discussions concerning various
campus organizations, institutions,
and customs.

———

Now we see wage increase after
wage increase and the administra-
tion is again clamboring for artj-
ficial controls: 10 limit the price
industry may be allowed to charge
for its products: It is patently ri-
diculous to control prices and, at
the same time, to allow wages to
soar skyward without any reason-
able relationship to these inflated
prices. This is bad economically.
But morally it is worse. For the
administration’s demands for these
socialistic controls is ostensibly the
will of the people. But if the people
are uninformed as to the true ef-
fect of such measures, then — their
so-called will is but a_ violently
twisted distortion of what it would
be if they knew all the facts. This
is an excellent example of the cor-
rupting influence this philosophy
has had on the politician, for how
can the people krow the facts when
nothing but untruths are told them?
And again, the individual has lost
a measure of responsibility and con-
sequently freedom to the govern-
ment. For he depends on the gov-
ernment to secure for him the
rights he once fought for himself.
And. saturated with untruths and
false concepts, he does not know,
of course, that capita} and labor
are mutually interdependent. If
capital is destroyed, the gdose
which lays the golden eggs has
been destroyed. Once this happens
the government must step into the
breach and set up a rigid economic
system which completely destroys
any ‘ast vestige of freedom.

3. The redistribution of income
by steeply progressive taxation.
When a man knows that the more
he makes, the more the govern-
ment will take away from him, he
loses the incentive to better him-
self, and an evil has been introduc-
ed whose malevolent effects are
impossible to overestimate. This is
perhaps the worst of the measures
chosen for examples since it strikes
directly at the very nature of man
himself. Man is a creative being.
Deny him the right to create and
he stagnates mentally and moral-
ly. And yet, why should a man
assume added responsibility, when
he will not receive a higher emolu-
ment in proportion to this increase
in responsibility? Why indeed?
When income taxes were first pro-
posed before Congress, Senator
Vardaman said the day would come
when the government would take
half of a man’s income. He was
hooted down in utter derision. The
idea was fantastic. But today taxes
run as high as ninety-one percent.
This is but another example of the
political corruption which this in-

SSS,
A

sidious philosophy has produced.
And there is not even a sound
econoniic reason for it. Roosevelt
and his successor claim that these
exorbitant taxes are imposed on
the wealthy to lighten the load on
the lower income groups. This is not
true. Out of fifty million people
filing income tax returns in 1945,
seven hundred and fifty-four thou-
sand had gross incomes of ten
thousand or over; forty-two thou-
sand had incomes of fifty thousand
or over per year. Not a very large
proportion of the fiftymillion peo-
ple paying income tax, nor does
the money taken from these peo-
ple. do much to pay the govern-
ment’s wasteful operating expens+
es. The bulk of the administra-
tion’s income for running expenses
comes from the man in the middle
income groups. And yet he is told
that the rich are being taxed out of
existence so that his load may be
lighter. At one stroke the Roose-
velt philosophy .is thus destroying
incentive and creating a nation of
dependent children who must be
spoon-fed by the benevolent gov-
ernment. The more the government
helps the people, the more the
government. must tax the people
—it is a-vicious cycle which can-
not end except in complete control
by the government. What the wise
and foresighted once did for them-
selves, the government now does
for all, forcing the prudent to be-
come veritable wards of the govern-
anent and taking away from the
foolish and indolent every chance
to do and_ prosper for themselves.
The more a government does for a
people. the less the people are al-
lowed to do for themselves. Is it
independence when a man is no
longer allowed to provide for his
own future? Is it independence
when he must pay, for the mistakes
of those less wise than he? Nol
Those who would creafe are de-
nied the chance. Those who do
not create become even more lack-
ing in initiative than they once
were. The benevolent government
becomes the government malevo-
lent and man, born to create sinks
ever lower and_lower. Further, the
industrial system which is an econ-
omic expression of the creative in
