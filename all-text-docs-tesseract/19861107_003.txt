Professors preview election results in forum -

By RAY THORNTON

To discuss possible outcomes.

of the Nov. 4 election, a pre-elec-
tion Forum, sponsored by College
Democrats, met Monday evening.

Dr. Tom Kazee, Dr. Lou
Ortmayer, and Dr. Mary
Thornberry, professors of politi-
cal science, were the featured
speakers.

“The current situation pre-
sents confusing cues to the
analyst,” Kazee stated in preface
to his election predictions. “We
have.an extremely popular Presi-
dent . . . however, the popularity
of the President is not a helpful in-
dicator in this election,” he sur-
mised.

Likewise, Kazee dismissed
the economic indicator as a valid
cue in making predictions, con-
cluding that “the outcome will be
determined by local factors.”

' Although he claimed to detect
a modest Democratic
Kazee maintained that “there is no
evidence of sweeping changes in
either direction.”

With some hesitation, Kazee
predicted that a 55-45 Democratic
Senate would emerge from the
balloting, reflecting a net gain of
eight seats by the Democrats.

“There is only an outside
chance that the Republicans could
pick up more seats,” he added.
Sanford: would: defeat. Sen: Jim
Broyhill, R-NC: Kazee favored

didate in Georgia’s Senate con-
“test. Bob Graham. (D) was
Kazee’s pick in the Florida race. »-

Kazee opted for Democrat Alan

Callahan critiques the American advertising industry

By BETSEY BRYAN

Monday night Ralph Calla-
han, president of the Henderson
Advertising Agency of Green-
ville, SC, spoke on “the implica-
tions of advertising on-society.”

Sponsored by Davidson’s Pre-
Management Committee, Calla-
han came in connection with the
American Advertising Educa-
tional Foundation. Callahan, a
graduate of the University of Vir-
ginia and the Thunderbird School
of International Management,
spent several years in New York
with the Young and Rubicain

Agency, supervising accounts.;

such a General Foods, Procter &
- Gamble, and Johnson
Johnson. He also managed Young

and Rubicain’s Amsterdam office

for three years. He drew upon
these experiences to discuss the
economic and social impacts of
advertising in America.
Callahan addressed the tre-
mendous success advertising in
America. He stated that over the
past few decade, “advertising ex-
penditures have increased every
year except 1981. In the U.S.,

and

can Christopher Bond in the Mis-
souri race.

Kazee also addressed elec-
tions to the House of Representa-
tives, concluding that “Democrats
looking for major House gains are
doing wishful thinking.”

He predicted a 10-15 seat gain
for House Democrats, . giving
them a 100 seat majority for the
next two years. Kazee favored
Alex McMillan (R) in the. 9th Dis-
trict House race.

“A. tremendous opportunity
exists for Republicans to. make
serious in-roads in governor-
ships,” Kazee stated

Kazee stressed the gubernato-
rial powers of redistricting as a
reason for paying particular atten-
tion to these results.

Kazee predicted that the GOP

clients spent $87 billion on adver-
tising in 1984, in 1986, that figure
increased to $94 billion.” Calla-
han explained that the growth of
advertising corresponds with the
growth of the gross national prod-
uct, and advertising money makes
up about two percent of the GNP.
Newspapers, which account for
27 percent of all the advertising
dollars spent are the most popular
ad medium, followed by teJevis-
ion, mail, magazines, and radio.
Callahan pointed out that indi-
vidual ads can be expensive. “A
one-minute ad aired once during

the Superbowl costs $1 million.”

However, Callahan also claimed,
“Advertising is by far the most
cost-effective means of communi-
cation more so than 10 years ago.
A 30-second television ad aired
during prime time costs approxi-
mately $0.04 per viewer. The

same amount of time on the radio |

costs $0.23 per listener, and a
magazine page costs about $0.37
per reader.”

Callahan also commented on
the effects of the recent mergers
within the industry. “It’s as

would capture 17 of the 36 guber-
natorial races, reflecting a net gain
of eight governorships for the Re-
publicans.

In conclusion, Kazee ad-
dressed the recent proliferation of
negative campaigning tactics.

_ Ortmayer addressed the elec-
tion’s possible effect upon foreign

policy.

“If the Democrats regain con-
trol of the Senate, things won't
change very much,” he theorized.

In support of his opinion,
Ortmayer said, “The Reagan
agenda is already well set and not
likely to change. Furthermore,
Reagan’s wish-list items are al-
ready in trouble in the Republican
Senate.”

_Ortmayer also held that com-

\

though the agencies are run by
Wall street; all they’re after is the
bottom line, the profit. I think in-
corporation detracts from the
people’s side of the business,
which is really important, and I
think smaller, independent agen-
cies will benefit.” However, Cal-

lahan quickly pointed out that des-_

pite the recent consolidation, no
one company monopolizes the in-
dustry. “About one-half the ad-
vertising is done by some 8000
agencies. The other half by the ad-

vertiser himself. Since 1962, the

top agencies’ share of the market
has grown _ proportionately

slowly. No one business accounts —

for more than 2.5 percent of the

total.”

_ The development of an indi-
vidual advertisement was another
topic of Callahan’s speech.
“Eighty percent of the planning
for an ad is done before the
copywriters and art directors even
begin because psychographics,

the study of the psychological fac-

tors influencing the targeted

mittee chairmanships would not
alter policy, adding, “It would be
difficult for a Democratic Con-
gress to take a very divergent line
from a popular president.”

Ortmayer’s emphasis was that
a switch to Democratic control
would make for greater debate on

arms control, aid to the Nicaragua:

contras, trade policy, South Afri-
can sanctions and the Reagan
Doctrine, the administration’s at-
tempt to roll back the tide of
Soviet expansionism and Third
Word anti- Americanism.

‘All reasonable voters will go
to bed before they know who con-
. trols the Senate,” said Thornberry
in her introductory remarks.
“This is a peculiar election in
terms of issues like farm
economy,” she said, adding,
“Here we have Republicans run-

buyer, is important. Also, 95 per-
cent of all ads are subjected to test-
ing in limited markets before re-
leased. It costs $130,000 to pro-
duce an ad and another $500,000
to run it on The Cosby Show, so
we can’t afford to release an un-
convincing ad. And before the.
finished ad is released, lawyers of
the agency, the client, and the
paper or network review it
thoroughly to prevent false and
misleading advertising.”

Callahan admitted that some
ads are “false, strident, and taste-
less,” but he maintained that the
majority of that this “minuscule
percentage” are local ads that fall
under no form of supervision. Na-
tional ad campaigns, onthe other
hand, are regulated by the Na-
tional Advertising Review Board;
a “self-regulating mechanism
composed of media officials, ad
executives, and members of the
public.” This group is working to
change popular misconceptions
about advertising. “Gallup polls

indicate that most Americans feel -

ning as far away as possible from a
popular President.”

“The Democrats ought to
capitalize on this, but they have no
workable alternative. The fact is
that neither party has developed a
strong, imaginative policy with
regard to the farm economy prob-
lem,” Thornberry said.

Concerning policy implica-
tions of the election, Thornberry
said that she was “very pessimistic

- about major policy changes until a

major economic crunch hits.”
Thornberry addressed the
need to keep the American electo-
rate involved and the efforts of the
Republicans to attract the black
constituency, a move she called “a
breakthrough in images.”

After the panelists spoke, they
answered questions fielded by the
audience. Approximately 30 stu-
dents attended.

IN

that ad people are direct descen-
dants of Mississippi riverboat
gamblers,” Callahan stated, “but
this really isn’t true. In the past 12
years, the group has received
1820 claims of false advertising,
but only 38 percent of these were
even worthy of review. Advertis-
ers make every-attempt not to mis-
lead the public. :

-“In addition to regulating ads,
the NARB also coordinates the
voluntary service campaigns ad
agencies undertake. Companies
annually donate $800 million of
free advertising to groups such as
the United Way and the United,
Negro College Fund.”

Callahan’ expressed disap-
preval for the inconsistencies in
advertising laws. “Beer and wine
are potentially harmful to people,
yet they're advertised on TV.
Why not cigarettes? If a product is
legally produced and legally sold,
it should be legally advertised on
television. People can abuse any-
thing, even caffeine. Where do
you draw the line?”
