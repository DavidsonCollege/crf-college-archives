Candidates Should State
Views Publicly Before Election

Each election awakens the peren-
nial problems of ‘‘campaigning.” This
question was brought to focus last
year by the so-called “Peden Amend-
ment.”

This amendment, which would
have allowed for limited campaigning,
was decisively defeated by the student
body. We voted against this amend-
ment then, and we would vote against
it now.

But this is not to overlook some of
the vital problems that the amend-
ment sought to solve. Primarily, it was
aimed at the fact that too often elec-
tions for important offices turn out
to be nothing more than popularity
contests.

Every student certainly has the
right to know what the candidates for
the top student body offices stand for.
And conversely, every candidate has
the right, indeed the obligation, to let
the voters know how he feels about
important issues.

The Davidsonian proposes a three-
point program which would include
the desirable features of ‘“‘campaign-

ing.’ and at the same time eliminate
the undesirable elements.

First, we would urge the -con-
tinuance of the five-minute chapel
talks by the finalists in the elections
for Student Bodv President and YMCA
President.

Secondly, we feel that a series of
open forums should be held in the
Union Ballroom in which each of the
three finalists in the Presidential race,
candidates for YMCA President, and
candidates for editor of the David-
sonian would state their views with a
question and answer session following.

Thirdly, each of the candidates for
the above offices would be inter-
viewed by the Davidsonian. In each
case, the candidates would be asked
the same questions and their answers
would be published in their entirety.

This three-fold plan would give the
Student Body a working knowled“e of
each of the candidates’ viewpoints,
and yet eliminate the poster-making.
hand-shaking techniques which are
alien to the fundamental traditions of

No Vesper
Collection

The Sunday night Vesper offering
has always been a source of play for
some students. Historically, as long as
most Davidsonians can recall, the of-
fering has come in for some pretty
rough treatment.

Abuses range from the depositing
of IOU notes, to the game of seeing
how many rows the plate will pass
upside down.

In addition to the abuses, there are
two other reasons why the Vesper. of-
fering is taken lightly.

First, many students give a lump
sum at the beginning of each school
year when they join the YMCA. This
money is in lieu of weekly giving at
Vespers. Secondly, and more im-
portantly, a large number of students
have already given to the church dur-
ing the day, either at Sunday School
or at the morning Church service.

Is it. necessary, therefore, that the
plate be passed at every gathering?
We think not, and hope that the YMCA
will consider doing away with a formal
offering as part of the Vesper service.

We do feel, however, that students
who want to should be given an op-
portunity to give on Sunday night.
This could be arranged by having a
particular designated place in the
Church vestibule where voluntary of-
ferings could be left.

Wise Decision

The College Trustees made a wise
decision this week when they voted to
raise the salaries of the professors. In
a practical sense. it was the only
logical action to take.

While Davidson College offers
intangible benefits that most other col-
leges do not. professors, like all other
people. can't live on purely psychic
income. And we imagine that their
wives and children want all the things
that other salaried people’s families
want.

So for the sake of its own protec-
tion, the college had to raise the
salaries. It is worth noting, however,
that fortunately these new increases
will be given on a merit basis.

Now it must be pointed out that
increasing faculty salaries is just one
side of the picture. To the faculty
member, “the trustees raised my sal-
ary.” But to the student, “the Trus-
tees raised my tuition.”

The absence of any widespread re-
action to the tuition raise shows that

the students not only support the
move, but also realize that in the long
run they too are benefiting. Tuesday's
Chapel program, moreover, in which
Dr. McGavock and Phil Lewis  ex-
plained the need for the increase did
much to gain student support.

A high calibre faculty is just as
important as new buildings, and a
high calibre faculty is usually found
where the salary is above the sub-
sistance level. The DAVIDSONIAN
supports the Trustees’ action and
looks forward to the day when David-
son’s faculty members are among the
highest paid in the South.

Language Lab

Wednesday's dedication of the
Jervey Language Lab was entirely
fitting and proper. The dedication not
only emphasized the memory of an
outstanding alumnus, but it also
showed that Davidson College is lead-
ing the way in a new field—required
labs for language students.

This pioneering spirit, as exempli-
fied by the language department, is a
standard by which other departments
mav follow. It is so easy to accept the
traditional way and the established
curriculum. Professor Pedro Trakas
and the other members of the
language department are to be con-
gratulated on the new conception of
language teaching that they have
brought to Davidson.

Davidson College needs a more
dynamic curriculum, and this is just
one example of how the college is mov-
ing toward the goal of being undis-
putedly the best liberal arts college in
the countrv. And bv the way, let’s add
the word small (i.e. little)—less than a
thousand.

Puddles

Although it's been hard to find the
walks with the snow covering every-
thing. we do want to mention the fact
that. after heavy rains the campus
walks have in many places been
rendered useless because of the large
puddles that collect on them.

Particularly in front of the College
Church and on the walk from Watts
Dorm to the Union, the lack of proper
drainage and low spots on the walks
make it necessary for students to blaze
new trails through the mud—areas
normally reserved for grass.

After the next big rain, it would
be a gdod idea for the grounds per-
sonnel to mark the places where drain-
age is bad and to improve the walks
in these areas.

REDUCTION RECOMMENDED

Board Of Trustees Too Big To Be Efficient

By CHAS. CHASTAIN

The Davidson catalogue states
that “the governing body of Da-
vidson CoHege is a Board of
Trustees elected by the Presby-
teries of the Synods of North
Carolina and Florida, by Ashe
ville Presbytery of Appalachian
Synod, and by the Alumni Asso-
ciation. The Presbytery of Con-
cord is entitled to elect cight,
Mecklenburg five. Orange and
Fayetteville four each, the other
six Presbyteries in. North Caro-
lina and the five Presbyteries in
Florida two each, and the Alum-
ni Association twelve, making a
total of fifty-five.” This is a
brief but complete statement of
what is perhaps the principal
administrative problem with
which Davidson 1s now con-

fronted.

The existence of this problem
has been recognized for some
time now—not only by students,
members of the faculty and the
administration, and perhaps
even a few members of the
Board itself, but also by the
North Carolina Synod’s Commit-
tee on Higher Education, which
two years ago, in a general sur-
vey of Presbyterian colleges, in-
vestigated the system by which
Davidson is governed and in its
report recommended that the
Davidson Board of Trustees be
reduced considerably from_ its
present size. This proposal was
rejected by the Board, which,
after seriously entertaining a
motion that its membership be
increased by the addition of new
alumni representatives, decided

to preserve the status quo.

The oddity of Davidson's situe-
tion is immediately sepparent
when it is compared with that
of other private tiberal arts
colleges. The typical Board of
Trustees of institutions of this
sort is often as low as fifteen
members and rarely more than
thirty; this is from about one
half to a little more than one-
fourth the size of the Davidson
Board.

The present Davidson Board
of Trustees is thus obviously
oversized in comparison to other
colleges of its type. That this
constitutes an obstacle to ef-
ficient administration and far-
sighted, constructive policy-
making is apparent when one
considers the consequences of
maintaining such a mammoth or-

Britain Seeks New Markets

Ed Note: The following is
the last in a series of three
articles by Spencer Mitch-
em on the state of the
British Economy. This paper
was originally prepared for
the International Relations
Club.

By SPENCER MITCHEM

After many years the govern-
ments of the free countries of
Western Europe are making an
effort to unite economically.
Several of these countries have
proposed a Common Market
whose object is to remove
steadily the protective duties.

Trustees Approve
Higher Salaries

Davidson faculty members will receive a substantial
pay increase under a new salary scale approved Wednes-
day by the Board of Trustees of Davidson and announced
by Acting President C. J. Pietenpol.

The increase, in annual compensation and benefits,
which will affect members of the faculty, administration,

and staff will total $87.000.

Not only will the salaries be boosted by $39,000, but
various additional benefits will also be supplemented.

A revised insurance program for employees of the
college will require an additional $4,500, and $9,500 will
go into an additional supplementary retirement fund for
non-academic employees of the college.

The $87,000 addition to the college budget to finance
the program will be made possible by an increase in tuition
fees from $600 to $700 which was also approved by the

Trustees at their semi-annual meeting Wednesday.

This increase will not

affect students with limited

finances now in residence at the college since $24,000 an-
nually will be added to the student grant-in-aid program, to
provide more than $150,000 for this purpose each year.

Change in salarv ranges for the various faculty ranks

will be as follows:

Previous Range New Range
Professors $5500-$8000 $6250-$8250
Associate Professors $4500-$6500 $6000-$7200
Assistant Professors $3500-$5500 $4750-$6000
Instructors $3000-$4500 $4500-$5200

and restrictions which hamper
free flow of commerce between
these countries.

FREE TRADE
Britain, however, is more in
favor of an Industrial Free
Trade Area than a Common
Market because she _ obtains
most of her foodstuffs from her
Commonwealth nations. Prime
Minister MacMillan proposes
that the restrictions, tariffs and
duties of each country which
hamper free trade, be removed
from industrial goods so they
may be freely traded.
NOT EASY
The achievement of these
aims is no easy matter, be-
cause in Britain herself there
is considerable opposition to the
Industrial Free Trade Area. In
many Britons there is an in-
herent distrust of a close rela-
tionship with the continental
peoples. The British trade
unions are afraid of goods pro-
duced “by the cheaper Italian
and French labor. And _ the
manufacturers are worried about
the steadily rising competition
from West German industry.
WORRIED
The British Conservative par-
ty is considerably worried be-
cause recent socialist victories
in by-elections have shown a
definite trend in British poli-
tics. If the British economic
condition does not improve in
the next two years it seems
very likely that the socialists
will be returned to power by
the national elections.
CONTRADICTION
It is certainly a contradiction
to loan (give) Britain millions
of dollars to strengthen her
economy, then place such high
tariffs on her goods that she
cannot trade with us and there-
by weaken her economy.

ganization (which, indeed, is al-
most as large as the faculty it-
self). The members of the Board
nicely fill up the platform of
the auditorium in Chambers, but
can such a crowd of them ef-
ficiently govern Davidson?

SHEER BULK

The sheer bulk of the Board
of Trustees make it impossible
for it to meet regularly more
than twice a year, and in the
intervals between these semi-
annual gatherings the current 9f-
fairs of the college are managed
by the Executive Committee, a
fifteen-man body elected an-
nually by the Board. As the col-
lege catalogue candidly puts it,
the Executive Committee ‘“exer-
cises practically all the power of
the Trustees during the inter-
vals between the meetings of
that body.”

This means that for six-
month-long stretches there is.
practically speaking, a Board-
within-the-Board which wields
effective power over current af.
fairs of the college. Such a situa-
tion is necessitated by the awk-
ward size of the Board of Trus-
tees, for it is difficult and cost-
ly to assemble so many men
more than once or twice a year.

Furthermore, the infrequency
of meetings and the great num-
ber of the Trustees tends to
restrict exchange of ideas and
opinions among members of the
Board to the brief yearly ses-
sions, to make it more possible

fer certain members to become
inactive timeservers and lose

‘contact with the college, and to

force the making of important
decisions into a few brief hours
(or, what is even worse, to post-
pone them for another six
months). The Executive Com-
mittee, although it functions
most of the time in plece of the
Board, is impeded in perform-
ing its task by the necessity of
getting final decisions on cur-
rent business (often long after
it is correct) from the full
Board.

It is obvious, then, that the
membership of the Board of
Trustees should be drastically
cut, at least by one-half and pre-
ferably even more, down to the
size of the body which at present
has proved to be the most prac-
tical type of agency for running
the college: the Executive Com-
mittee. This would, of course.
necessitate a great reduction in
Presbytery representatives—it
might even be better to elect
Trustees only at the Synod level
—and many village churches in
North Carolina and Florida
would have to forego having
their ministers“as Honored and
Exalted Members of the David-*’
son College Board of Trustees,
but I think that the quicker and
yet more well-considered de-
cisions and the more efficient
management that would result

would make such a _ change

worthwhile.

ON CAMPUS

A Gentleman Stops

BY CHARLES HELMS

We have pretty much recov-
ered from the post-dance week-
end gloom, but one quip lin-
gers in our mind; snapped one
date upuyu leaving the campus
after the weekend: “A Davidson
man is a gentleman from the
word ‘stop’.” But another girl
said something about the week-
end snow being very symbolic.

In his editorial “Crisis in the
North” (juvenile delinquency in
New York high schools) John
Trask has prejudiced the issue
with a distortion of facts. The
editor asked why the U. S. gov-
ernment has not used federal
troops to enforce order in New
York as in Little Rock, in as
much as racial tensions are at
the heart of both situations.

First, contrary to his assump-
tion, there is no substantial
evidence that “forced mixing
of the races" is “the core of
the trouble? In point of fact.
no one who is thoroughly ac-
quainted with the problem and
has no axe to grind thinks this.
Joseph C. Noethen, assistant
superintendent of schools said:

COFFEE BREAK

Boys Become

Older Boys

“Our trouble is not race against
race: It’s ‘have-nots’ against
‘haves.’ Race is only incidental.”

The explanation that most
school officials give to the fact
that much of the trouble comes
from areas where mixing is
high is an economic one (crowd-
ed living conditions, little edu-
cation, low income). Trask’s
editorial ignores the fact that
much of the violence is among
whites with no Negroes or
Puerto Ricans involved. .

Second, New York has always
been known as a mixing-pot:
mixing of the races is not exact-
ly brand new as it is in the
South.

Third, the intervention by the
U. S. government in Little Rock
to ‘protect social order involved
the execution of a federal
court order — which was not
the case in New York.

A good suggestion has been
made recently -for next year’s
YMCA gift fund: buy Dewitt
Roper a new jacket; the old one
has seen better days.

One senior announced that he

By BOB JONES

The Davidson scene this ‘week
has been marked by recupera-
tion from various kinds of

"snow furnished by the dance

weckend. In addition. the lang-
uage laboratory (with much
fervor and inspiration) was mov-
ingly dedicated to the greater
service of God and numerous
other things.

Finally, of course, the worthy
Board of Trustees saw fit to
gather for profound delibera-
tions concerning the future of
this noble (“a safe place to
send your son,") institution.

Such, at any rate, were the
high marks at this small, Pres-
byterian men's liberal arts col-
lege. On this particular score,
a reminiscence of the past ef-
forts of this column will serve
to show there are doubts if
the curriculum merits for the
college the name “liberal arts.”

Of course no one will dispute
the term “men,” but the term
“small” is taking a heavy beat-
ing from the intenttons of

the Board of ‘Trustees. Perhaps
it is time to complete the triad
and maintain that Davidson is
not Presbyterian.

A numerical survey would
indicate otherwise, but a survey
of the character of the school
finds a'most a total lack of
sound Presbyterianism. Very
seldom indeed do we find vigor-
ous protests at procrastination,
or staunch self-discipline so as
to use talents wisely, or reli-
gious virtues and values domi-
nating our individual decisions.

One would be hard pressed
to find any significant differ-
ences between the social” class
from which the student body is
drawn and the students them-
selves. Presbyterian virtues
are no more operative in the
lives of Davidson students than
in the society which they mir-
ror.

tn fact, we have well ex-
emplified on the campus the
recent sociological conclusions
of Riesman and Whyte, and
even the effect of the “hooks”
Vance Packard describes. With
this view we can smilingly ac-
knowledge that dance weekends,
and sacrosanct laboratory dedi-
cations, and blissful boards of
trustees, and all that seems so
ironic to names are all but parts
of insurgent sociological pheno-
mena.

Despite what we may wish to
believe, Davidson, in all her
glory, isn't making any differ-
ence,
