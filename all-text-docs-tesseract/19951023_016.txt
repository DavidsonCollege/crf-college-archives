trips.

FOOTBALL

Randolph-Macon shutout the

" Wildcats 36-0 Saturday afternoon, ’

marking the first time Davidson
has been blanked twice in a season
since 1985. In ‘85, the team was
shutout five times

Turnovers again doomed the
Wildcats (1-6), still in search of a
win after opening the season with
awin over Sewanee. Davidson was
picked off five times Saturday and
had a punt blocked.

For the Yellow Jackets (3-3-
1), Michael Hurt was the big offen-

sive star with a career-high 156 °

yards and a touchdown. Seventy
nine of those yards came on a

fourth-quarter run that capped the
scoring.

Davidson trailed at halftime
16-0 and took the first possession
after the break to the Randolph-
Macon 31, Onasecond-down-and-
7 play, quarterback Tommy
Dugan’s pass was picked off by
Evan Jones who returned the ball
55 yards to the Davidson 18.

“‘T was encouraged by the way
we played the last couple weeks,
although we lost,” Wildcats coach
Tim Landis said. “I think the inter-
ception of the first drive of the
third quarter was a crucial play.”

For the game, the Yellow Jack-
ets held Davidson to only 166 yards
offense and nine first downs. The
running game mustered 102 yards,
but that came on 37 carries. Lead-
ing running back Lorenzo Moll
was held to 34 yards, Four quarter-
backs totaled only 64 yards on 10-
of-35 passing.

Davidson got off to a rou
start as Randolph-Macon’s Bryan

Lewis ran 69 yards for a touch-
down on the game’s second play.
The Yellow Jackets added a field
goal in the first quarter and, in the
second quarter, Tim Armoska

picked up a blocked punt on the.

Davidson 2 and scored easily.
That interception early in the
third quarter led to a 7-yard pass
from Sidney Chapel to Drew Sibilia
anda 23-0 Randolph-Macon lead.
George Bland rushed 4 yards for a
score in the fourth quarter before
Hurt’s run ended the scoring.

Late in the game, the Wildcats"

managed to get down to the Yel-
low Jackets 28, but the fifth inter-
ception of the day ended that drive.

Randolph-Macon was able to
burn the Davidson defense for 266
yards on the ground and 356 total
yards. The Wildcats, meanwhile,
were unable to take advantage of
four turnovers.

Saturday, Davidson returns
home on Parents’ Weekend to face
Hampden-Sydney at 1:30 p.m.

Kleeman

from page 14

Clarke finished the scoring in
the 79th minute'when he collected
a pass from midfielder Fernando
Campos and beat the Mountain-
eers goalie. It was Clarke’s first
goal since playing Duke when he
was leading the nation in } goals
scored.

“We played an average game,”
Julien said. “(The Mountaineers)
were a team we probably should
have beaten 5-0, but we didn’t fin-
ish a lot of the chances we had.
However, we did what it took to
get the W, and it was great to get
the win.”

The win against Appalachian
State was Davidson’s first shutout
of the season with Deegan collect-
ing two more saves to run his sea-
son total to 75.

“App. State had one shot that
I thought was definitely a goal. It
was a turn-around volley, and
Deegan dove to his right and came
up with the save. It is great to have
him back there,” Julien said.

The win came after six rough
losses for the Wildcats dating back
to the Duke game, a 2-1 defeat in
which the Blue Devils scored the
game winner with a little more
than eight minutes left.

“We played pretty well,”
Deegan said about the losing streak.
“We just didn’t do the little things

it takes to win. We were a little

short and a little unlucky, and we
didn’t turn those one-goal losses
into wins,”

Four of the six losses in the
streak were by one goal, including
the first three against Duke, Furman
(a2-1 lossin overtime), and UNCC
(2-1) and the last, a 2-1 loss to New
Hampshire.

“We need someone to take

éontrol of the game and give us a

boost when we really need it the
most,” said midfielder Jeff Harrell.
“Tt’s hard for the defenders to do it
because we need someone to score
at a big moment.”

In the last two wins, Kleeman
provided the scoring punch that
the Wildcats needed. Also, several
players see the experience of this
team as a big advantage heading
toward the end of the season. Se-
niors lan O’Brien, Ryan
Northington, Eckman and Deegan
were all part of the 1992 final four
squad, and Troiano and Boylan are
both in their final seasons.

“T definitely see the seniors
really picking up the play on this
team,” Boylan said. “Eckman and
Troiano have stepped up as leaders
on the field in the way they play,
and senior leadership has been key.
We have six seniors, and this is our
last shot. Coach (Charlie Slagle)
has been doing a good job at get-
ting us on the field at the same
time, and when six of our guys are
really busting it to get the job done
it makes it impossible for the other
five not to raise their level of play
up to where we are.”

Troiano had a slightly differ-
ent angle on the seniors attitude
heading into the conference tour-
nament, equating the team with the
Atlanta Braves.

“The last three years we should
have done well (in the conference
tourney) and we haven’t,” he said.
“Tt’s kind of like the Braves, when
you falter a couple times the next
time means a lot more, and this is
our last shot.”

Julien played significantly for
the first time since his injury in the
Furman game. He said that his
ankle felt better Tuesday than it
did in South Carolina at the USC
Met Life Classic (Davidson fell 3-
1 to St. Louis and 2-1 to New
Hampshire at the tourney), but it
still wasn’t 100 percent. “By South-
ern conference tourney time it will
be back in good shape,” he said.
