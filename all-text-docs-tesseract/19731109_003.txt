Bevan Urges Measure
To Save Honor Code

By TOM AINSWORTH

The question of whether or
not the new E. H. Little
Library will contain some sort
of security to cut down on the
losses in books, or whether the
Honor system will be given a
second chance has caused
some basic disagreement in
opinion.

In an October 26th
memorandum to Director of
the Library Chalmers David-
son, Vice-President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan called upon the Library
Committee to devise a plan
whereby students would be
made more aware of the

serious situation in hopes of
preventing such 2 move as
security installation.

“I want you to know that I
cannot support introduction of
a turnstile system..." Bevan
wrote. ‘‘Before I could come to
this, I would have to forsake
the honor system and be con-
vinced that we have done
everything possible to con-
front our students with the
gravity of the situation.”

“Some students don't
realize that removing books
from the library is stealing
and carries the same punish-
ment as any other honor of-
fense,'’ Bevan said later in an
interview. ‘“‘When a student

Directors

unlawfully removes a book, he
is , interfering with the

education of his fellow stu-
dents.”’

What Bevan was most upset
about however was the
willingness of the SGA to in-
stall a check system after
being presented with either
that alternative or a com-
prehensive fee to cover
library losses.

‘“‘We apparently haven't im-
pressed upon the SGA the im-
portance of the Honor
System,”’ Bevan exclaimed.
“Their decision was the easy
way to deal with the
problem."

The other reason for
Bevan's unwillingness to im-
pose a security system was his
insistence that they don't
alter the situation very
radically.

“There is no evidence that
detection devices or turnstile
systems reduce the amount of
stealing. No system is
foolproof, and professional
book thieves can always find
a way around them. I don’t
think that the problem will in-
crease, but I doubt if it will
change the situation,"’ Bevan
remarked.

This viewpoint is likewise
held by other members of the
Library Committee, notably
Davidson, President Samuel
Spencer, and _ professor
Malcolm Lester, chairman of
the committee.

Of differing opinion,
however, are SGA President
Bo Phillips and nine other
Student senators who voted
last week 10 to 8 in favor of
adopting a turnstile system in
the new library.

Philips explained that the
Senate ‘‘wasn’t given any
decent alternatives to the
problem"’ and so chose the
turnstile plan after rejecting
the $10 fee to which every stu-
dent would be subject if a
comprehensgye fee were a-
dopted.

Song Selections

By LILLIAN GASCOIGNE
Asst. Managing Editor

Obscene songs are going to
be cut from WDAV-FM radio.

This is due partly to the in-
crease in voltage which
enables WDAV to braodcast
out of the college and into the
surrounding community.
There have been some com-
plaints from townspeople
because of the songs played on
WDAV.

Those in charge of the
station are worried about the
image which the station is
presenting to the community.

The Board of Directors for
WDAV met over the weekend
to establish guidelines for
what material may be played
on the station.

Members of the Board of
Directors are Professors
Charles Lloyd, Edward
Palmer, Robert Jackson, John
Hopkins, Dean of Students
Will evo and the phaand

OTOP eee eee Eee eee

Lawrimore.

Announcers will now be for-
ced to limit the requests to
songs which they know will not
be offensive to the com-
munity.

“We are not creating this
problem, it definitely exists,”
said Co-Station Manager
Robert Touchton. ‘‘Earl
Lawrimore has claimed that
he hears at least two com-
ments a week from Davidson
citizens about the songs
played on the _ station.”

- Lawrimore is the faculty con-

sultant for WDAV.

“The FCC is not involved in
this matter and we have no
plans to engage in anything
that would cause trouble with
them. We have received no
complaints from them,” he
said.

The FCC regulations state

that no obscene or profane
language should be broadcast.

__ Todo this is a federal offense.,

‘Moreover, I myself com-
pletely reject this domino that
once the library has adopted a
security system, that the
student store will be next. and
so on. That's just a bunch of
bull,’’ said Philips.

“The Library is used by
many more people than just
students. I think a good deal of
the book taking is done by out-
siders,"’ stated Philips. *‘Com-
paring the library situation to
the student honor code is
stretching the point a bit.”’

Nevertheless, the Library
Committee is faced with a
problem that seems to worsen,
but ‘nothing has been decided
upon as yet’’ Lester declared.

Meanwhile, the committee
is still evaluating security
systems already in operation
in libraries throughout the
state. The Honor Court Coun-
cil has decided to set up tem-
porary checkpoints in the
library for two weeks during
the Winter term to make
students more aware of he
problem and _ its __in-
conveniences.

Honor
The

college calendar calls for exams to be taken Nov.

16, 17, 19, and 20. Not all professors use the self-scheduled
procedures described here, so each student should deter-
mine definitely the exam arrangements for each course.

If self-scheduled procedures
instructions apply.

are used then the following

Go to the Student Store in Belk and purchase an exam
envelope for each of your courses using self-scheduled

exams.

Fill in the appropriate identification information on

both the yellow and red cards

and also on the top section of

the envelope. Give the envelope with both cards still at-
tached to your professor between 8 a.m., Nov. 8, and 5

p.m., Nov. 12.

Each examination envelope turned in will be available
during each examination session. You do not need to
specify in advance when you will write a particular exam.

Go to Chambers Banquet Hall between 8:40 and 9:15 for

morning sessions and 1:40 and 2:15 for afternoon sessions
and ask for the envelope containing the exam you want to
take at that time. The envelopes will be arranged
alphabetically by the student's name. The yellow card will
be detached and retained by the examination staff.

Go to any class room in Chambers and write the exam;
room 310 in Chambers is to be used exclusively by studen-
ts authorized by the professor to use tables, charts, etc.
The envelope with red card still attached and containing
the questions and your answers may be returned as early
as 9:45 in the morning and 2:45 in the afternoon and must
be returned before the deadline of 12:15 for the morning

and 5:15 for the afternoon.
The honor pledge must be

signed at the examination

center table as you turn in the exam envelope.
The yellow card, now receipted by the examination cen-
ter, will be returned to the student; hold that card until a

grade for the course is received. In

case of any

irregularity it is the student's evidence that he turned in
the exam envelope containing exam materials.

College Revises Endowments

By ANDY LAMAS

With colleges across the
nation experiencing the ef-
fects of inflation, the proper
management of the en-
dowment fund has become in-
creasingly important.

‘And with the student body
enrollment increasing, the en-
dowment is beginning to
become inadequate,”’ claimed
Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David
Cornell.

In 1969, the Ford Foundation
published a report recom-
mending several ways in
which colleges ‘‘could more

wisely manage” their en-
dowment funds.

“The study suggested im-
plementation of a

management policy which
emphasizes total return and
growth rather than income.”
explained Comptroller Robert
Davidson.

The proposal was accepted
by Davidson College in 1969 and
was implemented in the 1970-
71 budget year.

Davidson uses the ‘‘total
return’’ concept for deter-
mining the amount of finan-
cial support that its invested
endowment funds would
provide for current operating
expenses.

Total return consists of two
elements, yield and ap-
preciation. Yield represents
dividends and interest on
securities; appreciation is the
increase in market value of in-
vestments held.

WDAV Station Manager Robert Touchton consults album
make sure that none of the cuts are obscene. Complaints

the Davidson community have forced WDAV to

¥

to change its -

'* policies to insure that no obscene songs are played over the air.

“The college’s primary in-
vestment objective is to
realize the highest possible
total return while at the same
time investing its endowment

funds prudently,” Davidson
said.

An investment policy which
has /‘as_ its objective

maximizing current yield
favors the present only
because investments with a
high current yield usually do
not offer much promise of high
yield in the future.

High yield investments, in
the long run, generally do not
maintain the purchasing
power of the dollar.

On the other hand, an in-
vestment policy of
maximizing growth will nor-
mally penalize current yield,
thereby reducing funds
available for current
operations. The total return
concept is a means of
achieving a more equitable
balance between these two
policies.

‘Using a prudent portion of
the total return (the sum of
yield and appreciation) to sup-
port operations allows the
college’s investment counsel
(Scutters, Stevens, and Clark)
to be free to shift investments
30 as to maximize total return
without being concerned as to
the effect of such gifts on
current yield,’ said Davidson.

At Davidson the total return

amount of income to be used
for the 1973-74 fiscal year, one
would take the following

steps:

1) The market value of
marketable securities in the
endowment fund as of June 30,
1970, 1971, and 1972 adjusted
for gift additions, is averaged.

2) A 5 percent rate is then
applied to the three-year
average market value to
