Baker succumbs to student
demands to stay open late

By Martha Knight

After pressure from students,
Athletic Director Terry Holland
agreed to lengthen the hours at
Baker Sports Complex this semes-
ter. -Effective immediately, the
sports complex will be open until
midnight Monday through Thurs-
day.

In addition to the longer hours,
new Nautilus equipment was in-
stalled in the converted racquet-
ball court/weight room.

The new complex hours are
Monday through Thursday, 9
a.m.-midnight; Friday, 9 a.m.-7
p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 1 p.m.-
7 p.m.

In past years, the sports com-
plex was open until 11 p.m. on
weeknights and 6 p.m. on week-
ends. Students expressed concerns
that conflicts earlier in the day
prevented them from using the
regular hours.

Asaresult, current Juniorclass
President B.J. Rudell and several
other SGA senators petitioned
Baker administrators to open from
9 a.m. until midnight throughout
the week.

However, Baker returned to

its original hours at the end of the .

1992-1993 school year when it was
determined that students were not
using the facilities during these
hours. The current schedule is the

’ result of efforts by Rudell to fol-

low up on a renewed interest in the
exténded hours.

Other changes include the con-
version of one of the racquetball
courts at the entrance of Baker into
anewweightroom. Assistant Ath-
letic Director Bob Price allocated
funds to purchase the state-of-the-
art Nautilus equipment.

Staff debates statement of purpose

By Rachel Dunifon

Administrators convened a
special staff meeting Monday,
January 17 to debate changes in
the Statement of Purpose which
were proposed by a committee of
faculty and trustees.

The committee, comprised of
faculty members Ben Klein and
Sandy McKelway and trustees
Larry Dagenhart and Bill Wood,
have spent the past year working
onchanging Davidson’s document.
Their revisions aimed at making
the revised version more clear, as
well as more representative of
Davidson as a whole.

A majority of their efforts fo-
cused on revising the statement’s
religious language —struggling to
affirm Davidson’s Christian heri-
tage while not excluding people

with a wide variety of beliefs. Pro- -

posed revisions in the statement’s
religious language have created a
great deal of debate at meetings of
students and faculty.

According to Klein, the meet-
ing with the administrators fol-

loweda different course. Monday’s -

meeting focused on ways that the
revised statement could reflect
Davidson’s distinctive character
rather than its religious language.

Klein cited “a number of in-
sightful comments and sugges-
tions” from administrators who
proposed that the statement em-
phasize Davidson’s commitment
to service and the fact that it is a
residential college. According to
Klein, Monday’s meeting was
“very helpful” tothe four commit-
tee members who attended. Klein
enjoyed being able to focus on
other aspects of the document
rather than continuing to debate
the topic of religious commitment.

Thecommittee has found each
of its meetings with faculty, stu-
dents, andadministrators very help-

ful. They now, however, realize
that “it is impossible to satisfy ev-
erybody” with oui rev ieee Asn
ment. .

The trustees must make ie

final decision on whether or not to

approve the revised Statement of
Purpose. The document will be
presented at the Feb. 3-4 Trustee
meeting, and they will vote in April.

themselves after training.

At night, they either docked
and slept on the boat or anchored
and slept ashore. The group expe-
rienced weather varying from high
winds to no winds to thick fogs.

The Florida Everglades trip, -

offered for the first time during
winter rather than spring break,
got off to a good start according
to trip leader Jonathan Brooks,
who said that the weather was
beautiful and the canoeing was
perfect.

The group was able to spend

THIS WEEK

lege chaplain, introduced the fea-
tured speaker, Reverend LaVert
Taylor. Taylor is the pastor at
Mount Olive Baptist Church in
Arlington, Virginia. A personal
friend of King, Taylor has been
involved actively with the Civil
Rights movement for over 35 years.

Taylor’s most vivid memory
of King was his speech on August
28, 1963, during the march on
Washington. Taylor watched the
speech from a jail in Louisiana
after trying to lead a voter registra-
tion drive. King spoke of his dream
of equality for all Americans, hop-
ing that his children would grow
up in a better world.

King’s dream has not been
realized, according to Taylor. He
