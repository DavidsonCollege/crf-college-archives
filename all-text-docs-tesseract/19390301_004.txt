The visitors opened the second
half with a rush as they scored
gavel points before Cowan dropped

in a snowbird. The Wildcats were

weakened at this stage of the
game when J. D. Hicks was eject-
ed from the game for pushing.

Despite a spirited rally, led by the
invincible Cowan, the Deacons man-
aged to freeze the ball well enough
during the closing minutes of the
game to preserve their slim lead.

“Foots” Cowan, lanky Davidson
pivot, outscored the Deacs’ mighty
Jim Waller, to gain some glory for
his team in defeat. The elongated
center was accredited with 18 points
while the Wakes’ Waller was sec-
ond with 14 markers.

On Tuesday night of the past
week the ‘Cats had defeated the
Wofford Terriers 40-22 in a listless
game that saw the Wildcat quint

a transfer last year.

Frosh Defeat
Greensboro Hi

Thursday night in a game play-
ed at Greensboro the Wildkitten
cagers closed a very successful sea-
son by defeating the Purple Whirl-
wind 38-24,

Greensboro broke the scoring ice
and jumped into an early lead, but
the Freshmen Don Bell
leading the way soon forged ahead.
The Whirlwind pulled up toward
the end of the second quarter and
the score at half-time showed the
Kittens ahead only 21-16. However,
in the last two periods with Ralph
Stair, Kit guard, holding high scor-
ing L. E. Dempsey to two field
and foul shots and
Spencer and Bell hitting the basket
consistently, the Frosh put the
game on ice. For the High's Demp-
sey and Thompson with 7 points

with big

goals three

apiece lead the scoring, while for
Davidson Bell with 17 and Spencer
with 9 were best.

This victory gave the Kittens*a

record for the season of 10 wins
in 16 games. In total points the
Freshmen showed their worth by

talling 541 points to their opponents
465. The season was a very success

Davidson’s Wildcat basketball
team drew a first round bye Sun-
day the Conference
basketball committee chose eleven
teams to compete in the annual e-
vent at Raleigh to be held March Ist
through 4th, inclusive.

3y beating South Carolina Tues-
night the Wildcats ran_ their
record to 9 wins against 7 defeats
for a 562 percentage and fifth place
in the conference standing. Wake
Forest continued to hold first place
and finished with fifteen wins a-
gainst three losses to lead the cir-
cuit and seeded favorite
in the tourney. Washington and
Lee, and Maryland tied for second
place with eight won and three lost
each, while The Citadel finished
in the number four spot. The teams
are ranked in the tournament ac-
cording to the position in which
they finished the league race.

In bidding eleven teams to the
Raleigh affair the committee set a
precedent, as there have always
been only eight teams invited be-
fore. However, because of the close-
ness of the race in the second di-
vision, it was decided to allow three
extra teams to participate this year.
The committee announced that in
the future the old rule would be
followed, with defending champ-
ions and the runner up in the previ-
ous year’s tournament being given
first consideration if they are a-
mong the deadlocked teams. As a
result of the added teams the tour-
nament was extended a day, and
will begin tonight as V. M. I. takes
on Richmond.

K. Sigs Win In

In the final game of the intra-
mural tournament last Wednesday
afternoon, the Kappa Sigs won
the consolation honors by soundly
trouncing the S. A. E.’s 33-15.

After the first minutes the
outcome of the game was never in

doubt. Scott opened the scoring and
the Kappa Sigs soon had a lead
of 6-2 which they lengthened to
14-4 at the half. The second half
was a duplicate of the first and
the game ended with the Kappa
Sigs ahead by 33-15.

Rose and Scott lead the Victors
with 10 and 11 points respectively
while Wood and Hackney were best
for the S. A. E.’s with 13 points
between them.

Weeks of “Intensive Practice
To End Soon; Intra-Squad
Game Looms -

Winter football drills, now in the
fifth week, are bringing forth plen-
ty of good material for Davidson's

football squad next fall. Many
members of last year’s freshman
team and “B” squad have been

showing up very well in the ses-
sions to date

A great deal of rain has made
it necessary to call off practice
many afternoons during the past
three weeks, and this has some-
what hampered progress in the
drills. But with the return of good
weather last week, a schedule of
rough work was resumed, scrim-

mage games being held on Wed-
nesday and Saturday.

Injuries Appear
Fate has dealt another blow to
winter practices in the form of in-
juries. Many were forced to the
sidelines last week with hurts, most
of which were minor, however. The
injured list now includes Grey Hun-
ter, Charlie Allcott, George Marsh,
John Barnhardt, Marvin Penning-
ton, Karl Jonas, Claude Hackney,
Granville Sharpe, and Bill Faison,
all out with bad legs. John King,
Bill Shaw and big Stan Yoder are
having to take it easy because of
injured shoulders.

The highlight of Saturdays intra-
squad game was the scintilating 80-
yard run of Stan Yoder, fullback
of the “Blacks.” After his team had
desperately fought the entire first

quarter to hold the determined
“Reds,” as they continually bore
deep into the Blacks’ territory,

Yoder grabbed the pigskin, crashed
through center, and weaved thru’
the secondary for the initial score
of the game. The second quarter
the “Blacks” again having
trouble with the offensive attack of
the “Reds.”

Soon after half-time, the “Reds”
again drove to the shadow of the
Black’s goal post, and this time
made their threat good. Bill Pharr
went off-tackle for the marker, ty-
ing up the ball game.
