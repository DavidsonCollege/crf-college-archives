mankind’s noblest pursuit — help-

knows that there is no “I” in

All men are cre-

and desires.
Snobby little imps — that’s all
they are. All you ever hear is me,
me, me. Any sense of altruism is
lost on these creatures as they steal
from their neighbors and constantly
put their needs before those of the
group. It isn’t until well past the

eradicate all semblance of individu-

children the truth of the world.

All men possess a certain in-

the shape of men, not apes. The
mental content inside a human body

Bring down the ceiling, I say
— level that playing field. We must
work together as a unit and give up
our selfish desires.

Heed the teachings of the late
Mother Teresa — and future Saint
Teresa — who devoted her life to
the poor of India and, indeed, the
world, expecting nothing in return.
No matter that she accepted money
from questionable donors or: that
she ran clinics that operated below

accepted standards. She gave up

Mother Teresa — or Saint Teresa — a model human being

her God and man alike.

Mother Teresa was a model
citizen — one whom we should all
emulate.

Damn the egotist that pursues
his own ambitions. All arrogant
egotists who wish to have their own
way must be stopped. You may not
believe it, but there are those among
us who walk around with a defiant
air, in their utter selfishness, as if
their egocentrism is as important as
eating or breathing. They walk
around as if they cannot be harmed,
indifferent to suffering, because they
do not believe in suffering.

Every man must obey his higher
power. These egotists snub our

God and our humanity. I can only
hope these individuals see the error
of their ways and come back to the
forgiving arms of their brethren.
Let us wipe out all sense of the
individual and place our importance
on the unit — mankind. Equality,
equality, equality — that is the an-
swer to our problems today.

Nochild deserves to be an indi-
vidual when we see the advantages
of a collective mind. Teach your
children at an early age to submit to
the collective will so that they may
have productive lives and maybe —
just maybe — they will reach saint-
hood like the venerable Mother
Teresa.

What happened to us’?

haven’t learned a lot in the hal
lowed halls of Chambers yet, but
already I notice a disturbing trend in
the way that the College perceives
the surrounding community and
vice-versa.
Last Saturday, as a member of
a small
discus-
sion

doesn’t. -
Two days passed, and I forgot
all about the misinformed woman,
but the issue of the College and the
town’s relationship did not goaway.
I discovered on Monday that, when
the school installed the “pass-card
system” on the dorms
and other buildings on
campus due to an in-

group, I

headed

toward

“downtown” Davidson to pose
questions to unsuspecting members
of the town.

The first couple citizens whom
we asked at the post office gave
quick answers and hustled off to
their box. Next, a woman answered
our questions, commented on the
town and its situation, and then said
that the College’s involvement in
the community has dropped off
noticeably in the past few years.

I was shocked. Davidson Col-
lege not involved?

Does she know that we orga-
nize 21 “Reach-Out” programs for
the specific benefit of the town of
Davidson, Charlotte, and the area’s
residents?

Does she know that all fresh-
men must participate in a service
project during Orientation to help
the Davidson community? Has she
read the “active lives of service”
clause found in the school’s mis-
sion statement?

Does she know. that the Col-
lege holds multiple fairs and orga-
nizational meetings for service
work, so that it is practically impos-
sible not to get involved in some
capacity? Does she realize that
members of the faculty and the col-
lege community serve on several
town committees?

She obviously didn’t, and still

- créased number of
break-ins and thefts,
public use of campus

facilities dropped to virtual nonex-

istence.

The College had and should
always have student safety as the
core of its focus. But actions like
the requirement of photo identifica-
tion in the name of student security
all but eliminate unaccompanied
visits to the Davidson campus.

The broader community that
the college once fostered has split
into “our” school and “their” town.
Safety anda lack of clear communi-
cation — not purposeful neglect —
has driven what was once a rela-
tionship of unity to where it stands
today.

While this institution has an
obligation first to itself, we — stu-
dents, faculty, and administration
— must understand that “our world”
does not end at Main Street.

As a part of a larger commu-
nity, the College has the power and
capacity to reverse any separation
of school and town.

The projects ‘and services~in*

place today do indeed help develop
and facilitate a healthy association
between Davidson students and the
townspeople.

But communication remains
the key to the reestablishment of a
greater community, the elimination
of misperception, and the restora-
tion of “us.”

Haven’t a clue as to what to do? Cool.

y dad forwarded to me arather
provocative e-mail this sum-
mer —areprint of Kurt Vonnegut’s
commencement address at MIT.
Unfortunately, it is too long to re-
print here, but I'll highlight a couple
of my favorite parts.

Don't feel guilty if you don’t
know what you want to do with your
life. The most interesting people |
know

I figure I have plenty of time to
work in my life, and the average age
of graduate students is rising. My
brother entered the work force im-
mediately after graduating from
college and regrets to this day that
he did not fake some time off before
going to work full time. More and
more students are waiting a few
years .after finishing up their

bachelor’s de-

didn't grees before
know at they goto gradu-
22 what wm ate school. Be-
they i : .: sides, why
wanted to Pesky a nee should I rush
do with into something

their lives. Some of the most inter-
esting 40 year olds [know still don’t.
This one definitely struck home
with me. I came to Davidson much
the way [come into my senior year:
without a clue about my future ca-
reer. Sure, I have ideas of what I
want to do with my life, but nothing
definite. I do know what I don’t
want to do, so I guess that’s a start.
But by not knowing, I do feel
quite free to dabble in this and that,
travel here and there, do the hokey-
pokey, find out what life is like
without nine months of school or a
full-time job, all the while trying to
experience what I can. Granted, I'll
have to do all of this on a tight
budget, unless I win the lottery.
To be honest, I do have an idea
of what I'd like to do the first winter
after I graduate. I'd like to be a ski
patrol person somewhere closer to
home than Davidson, perhaps Lake
Tahoe. The majority of ski patrol-
lers are volunteers, but even if I
received a small wage, I’d probably
still try to find a bartending job. I’d
meet some interesting people I’d
never run into at Davidson, and I’d
get to swish through powder and
bounce over moguls all winter.

I’mnot completely sure I want to be
doing?

Some seniors — not to men-
tion juniors, sophomores, and even

summer. Nothing can excite you
like stepping beyond the realm of
the known into the unknown. The
unknown is often feared because
people do not know what the conse-
quences will be, or are afraid of
what they might be.

Take something as simple as
dancing. I know people who will
not go out on the dance floor be-
cause they fear being laughed at.
But you never know what will hap-
pen if you don’t try. You may
discover dancing to be a great stress
release, that you can just let go,
move to the beat, and relax. You
may even learn more about the real
you.

Davidson is often called con-
servative, and I guess I’d go along
with that. We are all stereotyped as

not being risk takers. |

“SO go ahead, step up to
the edge, heart racing,

stomach churning.”

know that there are some
daredevils here, just not
enough.

Taking a risk
could be wearing aname
tag around so people

freshmen— know exactly what they
want to do after graduation. I know
many who have medical and law
schoolaspirations. And that’s great.
They know what they want to do
and are taking the steps to get there,
and the vast majority will. But if
you are not certain about what you'd
like to with your future, why jump
into something you only think in-
terests you? Yourisk losing a year
or more of your life doing some-
thing you don’t really want in the
first place. Aftera year off, I’ ll have
a better idea as to what I want out of
life.-

Do one thing every day that
scares you.

This is a short and simple state-
ment, and it stayed with me all

will always know your
name and not call you by a despi-
cable nickname. Or it could be
coloring your hair purple. Or stand-
ing up with your face painted at a
women’s basketball game shriek-
ing until the Wildcats win or you
pass out — whichever comes first.
Or it could be something as cool as
going abroad to Africa or Southeast
Asia.

Taking risks means stepping
outside of your comfort zone and
into a vulnerable position, and this
can be difficult todo. But you can’t
play the game if you don’t throw the
dice. So go ahead, step up to the
edge, heart racing, stomach churn-
ing, beads of sweat rolling down
your back — step up, take a deep

breath, and leap.
