Martin: Inauguration Is A

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON. N. C. WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 1959

Time Of Recommitment |

"We are grateful to the trustees, faculty,
so much to make this day a memorable day i
of Dr. Grier Martin to the DAVIDSONIAN in an interview yesterday concerning to-,

hand, and a staff to operate and and will improve the situation

day’s inauguration.

Since the Dana Science Build-
ing has been one of Dr. Mar-
tin’s greatest achievements, the
interview conversation touched
on the Challenge Program.

Said Martin, “More than
$500,000 has been raised to-
ward our goal of $700,000.
The original estimate for
completion of the project,
which will complement Mr.
Dana’s grant of $400,000, was
$600,000, but it looks as if
we're going tc need more
than that to complete the
science building and the new
dormitory.

“AIl these building projects,
as you know, arc part of the
Ten-Year Plan, started by Dr.
Cunningham in 1956. T h e
science building should be fin-
ished by Christmas of * next
year: work will start on the
dormitory this July, with sehe-
duled date of completion one
year from then.

' "The fast major physical
Structure of the Ten-Year

Plen will be the construction
of a Music and Fine Arts
building, but we haven't
made definite plans for it
yet. From there we'll go in-
to improvement and addition
to the facilities we have now.

“One of the biggest and most
worthwhile projects, I. think,
will be the institution of an
Audio-Visual Center. The Cen-
ter will have not only films and
equipment permanently o n

i

maintain it, but it will keep a
complete file with information
on where to get special films
wanted by professors. It should
be a real innovation.

“The library is a continuous
project in itself. Recently we
were extremely lucky to receive
an anonymous gift of $50,000
for the library. The investment
income from this gift will be
more than $2000 a year, all af
which will go to the library.”

The interview switched to
student enrollment and admis-
sion problems.

“This year the admissions
committee has been a_ bit
more selective. We have had
more applicants with higher
qualifications. We do give
some extra consideration to
ministerial students and to
sons of alumni, but we try to
be as objective as we can.
We don’t anticipate any in-
crease in student body size
next year, but one can never
tell who will come and who
won't.

“Along the line of increased
student enrollment. of course
we are increasing the faculty to
take the extra load. One of the
good points in -increasing stu-
dent body size to a thousand is
that certain advanced classes
with four or five students now
could be taught just as effec-
tively with ten or twelve. This
will make for a more econom-
ical use of faculty members,

students and friends who have done
in our lives.”” Such was the statement

from all standpoints, I think.”

The whole of Dr. Martin's in-:

augural statement follows:

As the time for my formal
inauguration has come closer,
t have felt that it is an oc-
casion which brings together
the people who are most in-
terested in Davidson College
for a service of recommit-
ment to the ideals of the in-
stitution.

In this sense it means oa

|,

great deal more to me than .

the pomp and ceremony of
the academic procession and
the formal installation ser-
vice.

It is of course the occasion
for mo to make my own com-
mitment to the College to
carry out the duties and re-
sponsibilities to the best of
my abilify.

it is perhaps fortunate that
1 have had almost a year of
service in the office of pres-
ident and.can therefore make
this commitment with a much
better knowledge of all that
is involved.

This inauguration a Is o
brings together our families
and friends and this is a
cause for rejoicing on our
part,

We are grateful to the trus-
tees, faculty, students, and
friends who have done s o
much to make this day a
momorable one in our lives.

Davidson Plant: A Symbol
Of Dedication, Progress

If you are one of the many visitors who are at Davidson for but a short time,
you are invited to inspect the buildings— some new, some not so new—and look for
a while if you will, at the framework of Davidson College. Buildings, like most all
structures formed by human hands, are certainly no better than the men and
women who manipulate them. Davidson can be proud not only of those who lead
and instruct, but also the physical plant in which its students live and learn.

DAVIDSON .MOTTO

The truth that there is a
right way to do everything is
readily seen to be a Davidson
motto when one takes note of
this campus. But to do a job
right and right the first time
often takes much money. This
Davidson knows; and this Pres-
ident David Grier Martin
knows. Money has been needed
and money has been obtained
and more money will be needed
to help meet the increasing
needs of education, quality edu-
cation that will provide answers
for this changing world.

Quality education as well as
quality physical manpower go
hand in hand with pleasant sur-
roundings. Surroundings that
meet the need, surroundings
that wil] last. This Davidson
College knows; this President
David Grier Martin knows. And
through the efforts of Presi-
dent Martin and his admini-
stration, alumni and friends of

made to know and see this, and
the results have been—what
you see about you today and
what you will see here years
from today.

TWO MILLION DOLLARS

Almost two million dollars
have been invested in new
buildings and equipment at
Davidson since the appointment
of Mr. D. Grier Martin as pres-
ident of the college. The Bab-
cock Library Wing has been
constructed at a cost of $27,-
000, the Patterson Fraternity
Court at a cost of $500,000, the
New Dormitory to be located
behind Belk Dormitory and to
be completed in 1960 at a cost
of $350,000, and the Dana
Science Building to be complet-
ed this year at a cost of $675,-
000. All of these buildings plus
the New Post Office across
from the College Church have
been started since 1958.

TEN YEAR PLAN

(1957-1967), a plan “to meet the
space age challenge”, has been
set up to help the college in its
efforts to plan wisely and on a
broad scale. Much of this plan
has been completed and much
remains to be done. A Fine Arts
Building, a Meditation Chapel,
Athletic Plant Additions, Facul-
ty and Staff Housing and a Col-
lege Inn, all stand on the list of
things to come.

Davidson College is growing,
it is making capital improve-
ments. Additions and improve-
ments that will be needed to
meet the expected one thou-
sand student enrollment of the
near future.

Davidson is proud of what it
has, and it has confidence that
when its students return to
Davidson ten years from now,
they will be equally proud of
those things which farsighted
alumni and friends of Davidson
