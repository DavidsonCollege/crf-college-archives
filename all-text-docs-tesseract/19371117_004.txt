On one play the ‘Cat line blocked
a Harvard kick; the ball

straight up, came down in a young

lake, and bounced about a foot in

the air!, However an extra strong
gust came along right then and
blew it fifty yards clear over the
Davidson goal All who believe
that!
(

The best story Felix has heard
yet, and which, strangely enough,
seems authentic, runs like this:

Throughout the game Frank P irdy
snapped the ball to the backs very
softly. After it was all over Coach
asked, “Frank, why didn't you put
a little that ball?”
“Well, Coach, I tell you,” drawled

Frank, “that thing was pretty wet

and I couldn't

handle it very well,

so I just threw it up in the air

and let the wind take it on back
there.”

The Dukes proved themselves
true gentlemen and sportsmen. The
only referee available was a Dav-
idson man, and yet they didn’t
make a single “kick” about the of-
ficiating even when close decisions
went against them—an example
which the Davidson cheering sec-
tion would do well to follow, es-

pecially at basketball games.
