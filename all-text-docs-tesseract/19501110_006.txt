To Accept’ Negroes

In Graduate Schools

The Board of Trustees of the
University of Louisville has voted
unanimously to admit Negroes. Be-
ginning this month, Negroes_ will
be allowed to register in the grad-
uate and professional schools, and
in the whole University in Septemn-

ber, 1951.

Municipal College, Negro branch
of the University, will be closed on
June 30, 1951. Action constituted
notice to the Municipal faculty
members that their employment
will end on that date. Dean Ber.
tram W. Doyle of Municipal Col-
lege told the trustees that his facul-
ty is in favor of the move even
though it meant the loss of their
jobs.

“There was no question that the
trustees would admit Negroes,” said
President John W. Taylor. “The
only question was how it could be
worked out as a practical matter,
such as whether we have sufficient
facilities for expanded classes.”

Those schools to which Negroes
wilt be admitted this month are
Medical, Law, Dental, School of
Social Work, Graduate School.
Scientific School. Music, gradu-
ate courses in the Division of Adult
Education. The only remaining di-
vision of she University, the College
of Arts and Sciences, will be open-
ed the following September.

Recommendations from each of
the University’s deans, the Univer-
sity’s chapter of the American As-
sociation of University Professors,
and the University Administrative
Council were considered before the
vote was taken by the trustees.

The board's decision to admit
Negroes followed similar action by
the three Louisville Catholic col-
leges — Nazareth, Ursuline, and
Bellarmine—and by Berea College,
Berea, Kentucky.

The Day Law, passed in 1904,
has barred admission of Negroes
to Kentucky colleges. The law was
amended at the last session of the
legislature permitting a college to
decide whether or not to allow Ne-
groes to enter when the college of.
fers courses not obtainable at Ken-
tucky State College for Negroes
at Frankfort.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Uni. of Lousvile Harvard Financial Aid Center

Proves Aid For Needy Students

The new Financial Aid Center of , our

Harvard College is responsible for
Studying the financial needs of stu-
dents, and for correlating the here.
tofore separzte financial assistance
activities of the College, according
to Provost Pavi H. Buck.

We are hoping to free our stu-
dents from unnecessary financial
worries, and we are aiming for the
day when no student who is ad
mitted to Harvard will find him-
self forced to leave because of fi-
nancial difficulties, Provost Buck
explained.

As the first steps toward im-
proving its financial aid machinery,
the College has established a new
system of low-interest loans for
students, and expanded its staff
for interviewing and aiding needy
students, and for dpthiitfuy eviploy-
ment.

Undergraduates are reciving
about $750,000 in financial assist-
ance through the various College
offices. Gift scholarships amount
to about $525,000; and more than
$20,000 in long-term loans has been
granted. .

“In the Financial Aid Center we
are lrying to set up an office where

~

students: can get friendly,
prompt, and effective assistance in
working out their budget prob.
lems,” Provost Buck declared.”

Resides its work with students
enrolled in the College, the Finan
cial Aid Center is responsible for
informing prospective students of
the costs of attending Harvard
College, and of the financial assist-
ance a student may count on re.
ceiving. As one of its first assign-
ments, the Center prepared and
sent to all freshmen this past sum-
mer a statement of costs and fi.
nancial aids.

“It is safe to say that nearly half
the Harvard undergraduate body
is being assisted financially by the
College, either through scholarship
grants, or employment, or loans,”
Provost Buck explained.

“Each year, for example, we
award scholarship assistance to 20
percent or more of the incoming
freshman class, better than 2U0 men.
Our admissions records show that,
in addition to these men who have
applied for scholarship assistance,
have been turned down for scholar.
ship but admitted by the Admis.
sions Committee, and have decided
to come to Harvard anyway, with-
out aid.”

Dr. Pressly and his friend, Mr.

chatting, and just as they stepped
from a curb they looked up to find
‘themselves in the path of a speeding
vehicle. They scampered back to
the safety of the curb and as they
stood watching the car disappear
