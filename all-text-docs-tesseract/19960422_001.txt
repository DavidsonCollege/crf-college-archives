By Mary Ciare JALONICcK
Executive Editor

After three years of talks,
meetings, surveys, and debates the
trustees have finally voted on all
three religion issues. The require-

ments for the president and the
trustees will remain intact, butnon-
Christians may now on serve in the
department of religion.

It is noted, though, that “spe-

SGA charters and by-laws
committee recommends
not to renew IVCF charter

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
Assistant News Editor

The fate of IVCF’s charter
was the subject of serious debate at
Tuesday’s meeting and has not yet
been decided. In an announce-
ment that surprised many, it’s re-
newal was not recommended by
the Charters and By-laws Com-
mittee, although IVCF has existed
as a chartered body for the past
three years.

Senior Alison Sabel,chair of
the committee, explains that the
Charters and By-laws Committee

declined torecommend renewalof.ss:0% According to SGA. by-laws, a.

IVCF’s charter. because in a recent
amendment to its constitution,
“IVCF states that a practicing ho-
mosexual cannot be a leader in that,
organization.” For this reason, she
says, the committee felt it possible
that IVCF policy violates SGA by-
laws and the Davidson College
non-discrimination policy.
Within minutes of the meet-
ing, word of the controversy sur-
rounding the SGA’s debate about,

the renewal of InterVarsity Chris-

tian Fellowship’s (IVCF) charter
had spread across campus.

Both inside and outside the
classroom, students pondered the
situation’s legal ramifications and

debated the issue in terms of mo-
rality. However, throughout the
past week, many individuals
formed opinions based more on
hear-say than on actual circum-
stance. As is often the case, the
true facts of this emotionally
charged issue lie beneath an ever-
increasing heap of rumors and mis-
information.

The agenda for the April 16
SGA meeting included the annual
Senate vote on the renewal of char-
ters of those student organizations
who had submitted applications for
renewal.

leges to a student organization, in-

right to apply for funding by the

ity in reserving campus facilities.

Religion persons who, in addition
to competence in their fields, dem-
onstrate vital Christian faith and
unusual teaching gifts.”

In making these decisions, the
trustees are reaffirming their com-
mitmentto the Presbyterian Church
(USA), as they stated was their
goal in their February meeting.

The President of the college
must still be, according to the by-

laws, “a loyal church member,
giving evidence of strong Chris-
tian faith and commitment through
affiliation with the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church (USA)
and active participation in the life
of the college church.”

Also remaining is the clause
that trustees “shall be active mem-
bers of a Christian Church.” Thus,
non-Christian alumnae cannot be

eligible to become trustees.

The change in by-laws re-
quired a 2/3 vote of those present at
the meeting.

President John Kukyendall
says the debate came down to “gov-
ernance on one hand and equity on
the other.”

SGA Day was only the beginning toa fun-filled weekend of frolics, free food, formals, and

fresh air. Student senators cooked hamburgers, hot dogs, and veggie burgers for the campus,
the majority of whom flung their large stacks of crunch-week books aside and came to enjoy
the sunny day on the Union Patio.

Trustees ban kegs, table hours issue
Purchase of alcohol not discussed, BYOB not necessary

By BETH BAcon
Staff Writer

The Board of Trustees voted
Friday to support the recommen-
dation of the CCRL and President
Kukyendall to ban common con-
tainers of alcohol at Davidson Col-
lege. The new policy will go into
effect next fall.

Prior to the vote, the Trustee
Council on Campus and Religious
Life Committee received two rec-
ommendations from the campus
based Council on Campus and
Religious Life (headed by Dean of
Students Tom Shandley). The first
recommendation was to ban com-
mon containers. The second was

to extend the hours of weekday
parties from the current midnight
beer shut off and 12:30 a.m. close
to 1:30 a.m. shut off and 2 a.m.
close.

The Trustee CCRL decided to
send the keg issue to the rest of the
board, who voted in agreement that
they should be banned. However,
they decided to table the hours
issue until the alcohol policy is
more extensively reviewed at the
next trustee’s meeting in October.

The new alcohol policy is still
under construction. As of now, the
guidelines that each house can pur-
chase alcohol are still in effect —
eliminating the immediate need for
BYOB. This means that fraterni-

ties and eating houses will be able
to purchase cans.

However, Dean of Students
Tom Shandley says, “There’s an
expectation that we will certainly
come back to [the trustees] with a
recommendation on quantities al-
lowed for groups who intend to
purchase.”

There is still much work to be
done. Shandley says, “The stu-
dents who are on the CCRL will do
all they can to keep students in-
formed.”

SGA President Warren Buford
says, “The challenge now is to
continue that and come up with a
policy that’s not going to endanger
the success of our current system.”
