These two universities must

“You can't please all the

that we were consulted at all.

‘‘No requirement fulfillment
and no degree that
is our policy. Basic
requirements have been
stated and restated. and we
expect them to be met. As long
as the t is what it
is, we will abide by it.” said
Bevan.

At the beginning of this
year there were 80 seniors who
had not fulfilled their
requirements. and Stone
stated that there are ‘‘stull
quite a number’ of these
students who must complete
the P.E. certification of
proficiency in four individual
sports and one team sport.

Student opinions of the P_E
program are mixed ranging
from those who feel that the
program is an integral part of
a Davidson education to those
who argue that there should be
no physical education
requirements.

“The P.E. program is a
joke. What right does anyone —
have to tell us how to keep our
health! Moreover, with all the
time demanded by studies. if
you want to participate in ex-
tracurricular activities, P_E
really cuts into your time

drastically.’ said Jamie
Koloditch
“I am in favor of the

Physical education should be
a part of our liberal arts
education at Davidson.” said
Bob Penny

A common criticism heard
is that class times for the P_E
program are very in-
convenient and not enough in-
formation is given about the
classes.

“The whole program is very
confusing I heard from the
P_E. department in freshmen
year and then | didn't hear
anything again til now Also
courses are usually very
vague, and the written tests
are ridiculous, because vou
don't know what to expect.”
