Solution Needed Now

Last spring, amid predictions of
rampant drunkenness, the student
body voted out its restriction on the
possession and/or drinking of alcohol-
ic beverages. With the repeal went the
only truly effective means of main-
taining the college’s dry campus. —

Sinee that time, any action against
liquor violations have been under the
jurisdiction of the faculty's rules. En-
forcement has been inconsistent and
infrequent, and students consequent-
ly have no idea of what the faculty’s
attitude toward its own rule is.

Monday’s action in the disciplinary
case involving a student being under
the influence gives some indication of
what faculty opinion may hold. A cer-
tain amount of discontent is hardly de-
niable, when one considers the rarity
of a decision of the Executive Commit-
tee being overruled by the faculty as
a whole.

If nothing else. the action would
seem to indicate that the faculty does
not support suspension as a punish-
ment for a student’s being under the
influence, despite the fact that the
rule states that violations will “ordi-
narily” result in suspension.

Likewise, there has been no state-
ment on the faculty’s position on en-
forcement. The campus security of-
ficers have not noticeably clamped
down to take up the slack left by the
absence of student enforcement.

Both cases brought before the com-
mittee since the student body dropped
its regulations have come more or less
from chance encounters of the secur-
ity officers with violations, rather than
from any conscious effort to ferret
out offenders..

Likewise. there have been acknow!l-
edged instances in which security of-
ficers looked. the other way in the face
of obvious violations of both possess-

ing and being under the influence of
alcohol

The sum of the circumstances is an
aura of uncertainty as to what will be
the faculty’s attitude toward future
violations of their rule dealing with
alcohol.

The time is ripe for a realistic ap-
proach to the campus liquor situation.
Two years ago students and faculty
sat down and worked out a solution
satisfactory to most parties, under
the circumstances then in existence.
Changes since then make another
joint approach necessary.

It’s unfair to have a rule capricious-
ly enforced against a few, unfortunate
students. Yet. this will be the case un-
less some change is made.

A change in the direction of more
stringent enforcement will result in
such extreme measures as room
searches and additional security offi-
cers, resulting in an atmosphere of
distrust that will discourage not only
present personnel but prospective stu-
dents and faculty as well.

The other alternative is a reasonable
rule that can be enforced by the fac-
ulty and that will be respected by the
student body.

One basic step in this direction
would be a rewording of the rule
against being under the influence in
order to take behavior into account.
The present rule makes no distinction
between the student pleasantly high
and the student: making himself ob-
noxious or destructive.

The criterion of gentlemanly con-
duct is much more apt than is a gen-
eral ban on being under the influence.
Similarly, the prospect of a wet cam-
pus, which a number of faculty mem-
bers find so objectionable, has no re-
lationship to a student’s being under
the influence.

You're Gonna Pay For It

It never fails. Everytime you think
-you’ve solved a problem. a new com-
plication pops up, and you might as
well be back where you started off.

After a three-month controversy last
year over whether students should be
required to pay to attend certain bas-
ketbal! games played in the Charlotte
Coliseum, the Athletic Department
conceded that students would this
year be admitted ‘free’ —that is, they
would pay nothing over what comes
out of the $100 student activities fee
every student is required to pay.

The upshot was that while last year
students got 10 “free” games and had
to pay half-price for two, they'll get
12 games free this year. So far, so
good.

But the catch is that eight of this
year’s “home” games are in Charlotte.
That’s bad enough, but we can live
with it. After all, the basketball pro-
gram does have to show a profit to be
successful.

But to make up for the loss in reve-

Let The Council

In October THE DAVIDSONIAN
pointed out in an editorial what we
considered to be a number of valid
points in favor of the Sunday night
faculty open house program, a pro-
gram which until this year has been
an integral part of the Davidson tra-
dition.

In connection with the general re-
evaluation of the college’s religious
life, the program was tried, with con-
Siderable success, for the month of
October, and then replaced by a plan
in which professors, rather than open-
ing their homes to all students, would
specifically invite students for some
form of hospitality.

Since that time there has been a
substantial amount of support, both
within the faculty and student body,
for the renewal of some sort of prog-
ram similar to the Sunday night open
house. The faculty's interim Religious
Committee is committed to a policy of
experimentation until the end of Jan-
uary and considers that the open
house plan has had its chance.

When no other action was forth-
coming, the Student Council took the
initiative and began making plans on
its own to reinstate the Sunday night
open house. The plan would be en-
tirely voluntary, and faculty members
would not only be under no obliga-
tion to participate, but they would be
free to participate only when it suited
them.

nue from the two new free games, the
Athletic Program is making students
pay full prices for date tickets at Coli-
seum games, something not done in
recent years.

“We have no obligations to dates,”
Athletic Director Tom Scott told THE
DAVIDSONIAN this week. He's right,
in the sense that there’s no directive
saying dates get in for half price—it’s
always just been a policy of the school
to show students this courtesy.

Dating at Coliseum games is obvious-
ly much easier than it is at Johnston
Gymnasium. Yet the very year that.
only four games are played in David-
son (games at which dates can be ad-
mitted for the usual half price), stu-
dents will pay full price for every

ate.

Consequently, though the Athletic
Department assures the student body
that it’s getting good deals, any stu-
dent doing a nominal amount of dat-
ing will end up paying more than he
would last year for tickets.

But then, it’s all for a good cause.

Try

In the process of following through
on the program, a routine check with
the Office of the Dean of Students
brought the response that such a pro-
gram could not be undertaken until
after the January conclusion of exper-
imentation with other forms of fac-
ulty-student informal contacts, that it
would interfere with the trial pro-
grams.

Such an attitude seems incongruous
on two accounts. In the first place,
there's no reason why the Religious
Committee should be concerned with
the council’s plan.

Since the entire program is being
conducted on a voluntary and fairly
informal basis, there’s no reason for
any official bodies to become involved.
The program is mereiy one of coordi-
nating and publicizing what professors
will be opening their homes, all for
the convenience of those interested.

In the second place, undertaking the
plan would in no way sabotage the ex-
perimental programs now in progress.
There’s no reason the two plans can't
coexist peacefully. The council's pro-
gram merely broadens the opportuni-
ties that exist for faculty-student con-

ct.

For the committee to withdraw its
objections would ease the situation
considerably, giving the council’s plan
an opportunity to function in an at-
mosphere of harmony.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Social Fraternities ‘An Awful Sickness’

Dear Editor:

The recent anti-gnomian con-
troversy that is engaging the
ablest minds at Davidson is
also causing me. considerable
concern. It brought to mind a
number of reflections I have
had since leaving DC the
avhole of six months ago and
entering the ‘‘cold, cruel
world.”

Fraternities are strikingly
like the Ku Klux Klan. I mean
the real similarity is astonish-
ing. even with fraternities at
Davidson. Members band to-
Gether as brothers espousing
glorious aims and ideals, wear
sacred robes and call each
other Grand Dragon. or Holy
Brother or what have you. All
too often both types of organi-
zations desecrate Christian
symbols such as ‘the cross.

Members gloat (too often
seriously) over their shared
superiority which places them
on a level higher than ‘‘in-.
ferior’’ people—it hardly mat-
ters whether they call them
“Communist” or “nigger” or
“gnome” or ‘‘indepeadent.”’
The dehumanizing effect is the
same.

And why? Because of an

emotional need for security
and worth by feeling superior.

Whence this need?

It goes back to grammar
school for most Davidson boys.
Back then and all’ the way
through the first 12 grades
we were all superior. If we
couldn't outrun and outjump
our classmates (and many of
us could), if we weren’t rich-
er-(and many of us were), we
were always intellectually and
academically superior be‘ngs.

Then came the day we got
to Davidson. and it quickly be-
came apparent that we were
not at that moment superior
to our classmates anymore.

Problem: To continue feel-
ing superior.

Solution: Join a fraternity.
“Our fraternity is superior
© every really important
way,’ each frat man sings.
And invariably, amazingly, we
rushees BELIEVED. Man. we
wanted to believe. ‘Cause we
wanted awfully badly to feel
superior. And so we joined
and, sho’nuff. we felt superi-
or.
What is the price we pay for
this stultification of matura-
tion. this stagnation of devel-

CACULT

opment?

Plenty.

First of all, obviously, we
continued to bel:eve in the
myth of our own superiority.
It was a myth because human
worth is not measured in terms
of GPR’s or athletic letters or
number of madras garments
or club membership.

From this, we dehumanized
others. Our superiority was
(is) parasitic. We treated the
Commuuists, gnomes, etc., as
things. not as people. And all
too often the dehumanization
of others became automatic.

Consequently, we not only
failed to mature adequately.
but we also stepped on the
faces of others, made them
think they really were (are)
inferior or made them hate-
ful and resentful of us.

It has taken all these six
months and will take much
longer for me fully to realize
that people who wear white
socks and greasy hair or who
stink or have black faces or
are a bit ‘odd’ or eccentric
are HUMANS, beings of in-
finite worth, and not things
which I may manipulate for
the sake of my, own feelings

Davidson's goal of being one
of the top academic communi-
ties of the nation is praise-
worthy and is in no way de-
terred by men on athletic
scholarships. The building of
well rounded men in a college
community is associated with
growth in mental and physical
prowess, not either separate-
ly.

That the trustees and ad-
ministraticn realize that the
fielding of subsidized athletic
teams attract men who can
make major contributions to
both athletics and academics
in furthering their own lives
and the prestige of the college
is to be commended and not
degraded.

James Whitehead seems able
not coly to ‘‘disremember
style and the feed to grind
verse fine, and sink my heart
to the source” ..., but to
remember quite well.

And what he remembers is
the ‘‘First Lecture’’ of a mad
friend quite taken with his
therapy—“‘the end of style for
honest men js clarity.” So he
becomes capable of images of
tender force and humor and
ambiguous precision.

The important thing to do—
if it matters—is to be there
then. If he is not to be great
or even elegant in the minor
key dt least he can share and
this his poems demonstrate.
Of course, his equation poems,
the best sharings may deepen.

Tutoring Compensation
For Time Given College

No one will dispute that ath.

letes will have less time to de-
vote to both frivolity and study
than non-athletes.

Because the athletic depart-
ment offers tutors for students
having difficulty again proves
that the college is interested
in having their athletes as
qualified as any other mem-
ber of the student body.

That a person is offered help
with his studies, ie. via a
tutor. does not make him
mentally inferior. Is it pos-
sible that an athlete is super-
jor because he has to learn
the same material in half the
time?

Of course not. but this is the
same scatter brained logic as
assumi‘ng him inferior because
he has a tutor. :

What can a tutor do? Can he
by some magical process
create a turgor of knowledge
in his student? Obviously he
can do no more than corre-
late the facts much like a
history outline or a supple-
mental text.

Fools’ Name

And
Fools’ Faces

For Trustees Only

In a recent luncheon which I attended, Dr. J.
McDowell Richards, immediate past president of the
Board of Trustees and president of Columbia Theo-
logical Seminary was presented with a resolution of
appreciation by Walter L. Lingle Jr., current presi-
dent of the trustees. In accepting the framed letter,
Dr. Richards jocularly commented to Mr. Lingle that
he was surprised and sorry to see that THE DAVID- -
SONIAN had not yet told Mr. Lingle how to perform
his job as president, had not told him how to run the
college. Now ] cannot speak officially for THE DA-
VIDSONIAN, but I can write as a member of its staff;
moreover, far be it from me to pass up an oppor-
tunity to hand out some of my infamous, free, nor-
mally unwanted advice! In fact, I am prepared to
offer this service not only to Mr. Lingle but also to
the trustees as a whole. Please accept my “free of-
fer” and read hereunder.

s

IN MY OPINION the trustees are, collectively, a «
group of dedicated and able men. This truism is cer-
tainly nothing new; the question is how their ability
and dedication can best be used in contributing to
the welfare of the college. Perhaps the miost fruitful
way to understand this problem is to investigate the
concept of “the informed trustee” (cf. Memo to a
College Trustee by Beardsley Ruml) with particular
reference to Davidson College.

The principal problem is how to inform the trus-
tees: How to promote communication? My immedi-
ate, practical advice is that the trustees should have
more exposure to the physical reality of the campus;
it is certainly not too much to ask that a man who has
agreed to serve spend at least a week to 10 days a
year on the campus. The semi-annual meetings are
not enough. Among other things this length of stay
would have the effect of getting rid of the extraneous
hoopla and show which is made over a trustee(s),
simply because it is so difficult to maintain such a
show for five or six days.

Communication should particularly be facile be-
tween the trustees and the faculty and the trustees
and the administration. Each of these groups should
be in continual formal communication in order to
know what the other has done, is doing, and plans
to do; the semi-annual report of the president is not
sufficient to inform the trustees. Perhaps there
should be a monthly circular, prepared by each body
and submitted to the other two. The Trustee-Faculty
Retreat has greatly enhanced communication, but it
is certainly not sufficient. Similarly the trustees
should disseminate more of their formal reports to
the faculty; 1 think that no harm can be done by hav-
ing the faculty know the’ budgetary state of the col-
lege or the proposed plans for the future. The fac-
ulty should reciprocate by submitting their minutes
to the trustees.

_ The current size of the Board of Trustees is, I
think, prohibitive to effective communication among
themselves or between the board and the faculty and
administration. The trustees themselves have tacitly
admitted this by forming an executive committee
which conducts its real business. Of course, any re-
duction in number must be accepted by the present
trustees, and we all know how difffieult it is to get
any group to abolish itself or reduce its membership.
But this would not necessarily mean any reduction
in authority or power. Correspondingly, I think the
trustees should have more control over the specific
makeup of the trustees; they should be able to elect
some members of the trustees themselves. Naturally,
the talents of the numbers of men who would no
longer be on the board should not be lost; perhaps
they could be appointed to the Board of Visitors. A
reduction in the size of the trustees should mean an
equitable reduction; the presbyteries and the Alumni
Association would both have to give up some places.
This would particularly benefit the presbyteries since
they might be able to not limit their field to their
own presbytery.

BUT ONCE there are “informed trustees” what
Should be their specific relation to the day to day
operations of the college? I think that the trustees
Should be an informed, overseeing body. As over-
Seers they should leave all basic policy details to
the administration and faculty, under strong leader-
ship; such major decisions as those concerning en-
dowment or the establishment of a co-operative
woman's college should be those of the trustees.
Moreover, they should accept any policy decision of
the faculty which has the overwhelming support of
that body, such as on matters like subsidized ath-
letics. The trustees should always ask for the consul-
tation of the faculty and administration on such ma-
jor decisions as the appointment of a Dean of Stu-
dents or a Director of Athletics—or even a President.
1 am familiar with the arguments concerning the lack
of objectivity on the part of the faculty and admin-
istration, but nobody knows the college as these peo-

o.

P ® s *

As Rumi says, “The informed trustee need not
be a nuisance.” He can be and should be a primary
asset to the college. But he must be infermed! The
preliminary report of the Danforth Commission on
Church Colleges and Universities asserts that ‘the
weakness of boards is frequently traceable to a fail-
ure to inform trustees on the matters for which they
are responsible.” And so, Mr. Lingle and fellow mem-
bers of the Board, I advise and beseech you to be
constantly seeking to improve the quality and quan-
tity of the degree to which you are informed trus-
tees. There can be no limit to this task and, corre-
spondingly, no limit to the contributions you can
make, to Davidson College.
