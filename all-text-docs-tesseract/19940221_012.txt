Nuclear Plant promises

By Lexy DeVane

Optimistically, I turn the key
to open my P.O. Box. The typical
dusty wind gushing from an empty
box does not welcome me. I am
greeted instead by acalendar from
McGuire Nuclear Station--the
same station to which I have be-
come acquainted through frequent
siren test notifications

The calendar turns out to be a
gift complete not only with scenic
pictures of Lake Norman but also
an emergency “plan for people who
live, work or go to school, within
10-miles of the nuclear station.”
The words hit me—I was living
within ten miles of anuclear power
plant and had never even stopped
‘) think twice about it. Visions of
Chernobyl and Three Mile Island
filled my head.

The next day 1 ventured six
miles down Highway 835 onto the
premises of McGuire Nuclear Sta-
tion. Buzzing transformers and
mammoth buildings surrounded
meas I made my way to the Energy
Explorium.

Karin Surratt, Community
Relations Representative, met me
at the Explorium to take me on a
tour of the power plant. Prior to
entering the plant, I had to fill out
numerous security clearance forms,
present a photo I.D., pass through
a metal detector and a high-tech
explosives “sniffer,” and don astyl-
ish orange hard hat and goggles,

McGuire Nuclear Station, one
of three nuclear plants‘owned by

Duke Power, is a fully functioning
nuclear capacitor providing energy
for over 1.7 million residents in
North and South Carolina. Its
massive buildings are bathed in
security devices including motion
detectors, alarms, and concrete
blockades prohibiting driving near
the reactors.

McGuire meets construction
standards and could conceivably
withstand the highest level earth-
quake and operate securely even if
turned upside-down.

In 1992, McGuire produced
61% of the energy used by resi-
dents in the Central Piedmont re-
gion through a process called
nuclear fission. The “nuclear fuel”
used in this process of atom split-
ting is Uranium 235 which is manu-
factured into the form of one-inch
pellets. One uranium pellet pro-
duces as much energy as 149 gal-
lons of oil, 1,780 pounds of coal or
157 gallons of regular gasoline.

One problem exists with this
seemingly ideal system: Uranium
is highly radioactive. Although
radiation originates from many
every day sources including the
sun, dental X-rays, and color tele-
vaca ties dosages can cause
many negative and even lethal ef-
fects. A nuclear reactor plant in the
area presents the possibility of a
serious accident.

My extensive tour gave me
the impression that McGuire real-
izes the serious nature of nuclear
energy. The plant is teeming with

Chile Ristras:

Mexican food at a moderate price

By Alex Crumbley

Finally, Davidson and Corne-
lius residents no longer have to
drive to Charlotte to find good
south-of-the-border cuisine. On
Tuesday, Chile Ristras Mexican
Steak House, located beside Mov-
ies atthe Lake in Comelius, opened,

‘ bringing gourmet Mexican food, a

spacious bar, and an upbeat atmo-
sphere right to our doorstep.
Don’t expect Taco Belloreven
El Cancun prices— Chile Ristras’
menu features $15 steaks, and chips
are not free, but a tasty meal for

security stations by which every
worker, each with an appropriate
security clearance level depending
on his job, must be checked.

In “the Brain” of the plant
several staffs continuously moni-
tor the computers in twelve hour
shifts. These trained teams prac-
tice emergency training procedures
inamock-control room every fifth
week.

If an accident were to occur,
the emergency plan calls for all
heads of all departments to meet in
acentral area within 75 minutes of
notification. From this room major
decisions could be made.

Employees who work in ra-
diation zones are fully dressed in
appropriate protective gear. They
are required to wear “beepers”
which monitor the level. of radia-
tion they receive. The total amount
of radiation workers receive annu-
ally is significantly lower than the
government standards.

‘Throughout the ten mile area
surrounding the plant, 53 sirens
can warn the community in the
event of a dangeroussituation. The
sirens are fully tested four times
during the year and are controlled
by the local government, which
also monitors the plant.

Evacuation routes are printed
in the back of the calendars distrib-
uted to all neighboring residents to
further assist them in the event of
an emergency.

In addition to safety concerns,
the issue of uranium disposal is

Fancy Dress at Davidson?

Party continued from page 10

free of charge, held during the an-
nual Winter Carnival. With only a
$5,000 budget, the Winter Carni-
val is able to provide professional
decorations from Boston, a mo-
town band, a string quartet, a folk
band, karaoke, free food, and door
prizes. All students receive invita-
tions and are not required to bring
dates.

Davidson, with a much
smaller Greek system and a male
population split almost evenly be-
tween Greeks and Independents,
has no tradition of all-campus
dances. The purpose of an all-
campus dance would be to foster
unity by bringing all students to-
gether in a common location to
socialize without the division be-
tween Union and court events.

The Union Social Board de-
serves praise for its initiative in

-this direction; however, Union

events advertised as “all-campus”
enjoy limited success due to com-
petition from parties on the court.
While the Union’s most recent ef-
fort, Midwinters’ “Dancing on
Ice,” received rave reviews from
those who attended, it was not the
ideal all-campus party which would
bring the entire campus together
successfully.

Independents are not the only
students left out of closed frater-
nity parties and semi-formal week-
ends. Many women resent the fact
that they cannot fully participate in
the three date weekends unless in-
vited by a fraternity member. A
truly all-campus dance would en-
able women to invite their own
dates or attend with friends.

Financing such an event is ex-
pensive (“Fancy Dress” costs
around $70-$80,000), but scaled-
down versions could be paid for by
ticket sales and other fund-raisers.

Commons are both facilities that
could easily be transformed into
locations for an all-campus dance
at Davidson. An off-campus site
such as an hotel in Charlotte is
another option.

Recently-elected SGA Vice
President Allison Sabel ran with a
campaign promise of such an all-

campus dance. She believes that °

such an event will succeed if, “all
organizations put in money to geta
well-known band.” The Patterson
Court houses, the Union, and the
SGA should, according to Sabel,
contribute the event so that, “they’d
have a stake in it too and would
come.”

Sabel has received a lot of
feedback from students who sup-
port “another option to get the
whole campus together so inde-
pendents are not excluded from
the court.” Sabel and Eric
Rosenbach, SGA President-elect,
have discussed plans for the idea.

two of appetizers, and an enchi-
lada or chimichanga entree can cost
only $20 if ordered carefully.
While it is priced a little higher

than El Cancun and certainly Taco °

Bell, you get what you pay for.
Chile Ristras gives you plenty
of food, and though chips cost three
dollars, they bring a huge basket of
red, white, and blue corn tortilla
chips with both green and red salsas
'to dip into. The chimichangas are
fat and dressed up with different
cheeses, rice, and beans, and the
black bean soup is the best I’ve

power but poses threat

another source of controversy re-
lated to the power plant. Although
uranium is recycled three times at
McGuire, McGuire’sstorageis fill-

ever had. A five or six-dollar ap-
petizer can fill up the light eater or
leave room in the hearty eater for a
couple of the German brews on tap
at the bar.

Though rather upscale as
Mexican places go, Chile Ristras
is not as expensive as Kobe, and
would be a good place to go before
a date function. The atmosphere is
versatile; the decor is nice enough
that you can blend into the crowd
dressed up or in jeans.

Chile Ristras, which in Span-
ish means strands of Chiles, hang
throughout the restaurant bringing
the southwest a little south of
Davidson.
