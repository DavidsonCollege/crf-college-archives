Dean of Students Proposes Carmpus-Wide Alcohol Policy

By Tom Koonce

After several years under two
separate alcohol policies -one for
Patterson Court and one for the
rest of the college, Davidson is
about to adopt a campus-wide al-
cohol policy that will drastically
change the nature of alcohol use at
the school.

After receiving a mandate from
the Trustees last month to develop
such a policy, Dean Will Terry

drafted a working paper for”

Davidson’s alcohol policy: He

presented:this bs Oe report to the
presidents of Patterson Court and
the Council on Campus and Reli-
gious Life last week.

. The paper states that this pol-
icy is for “discussion, review,
amendment, and suggestions.” It
is therefore not the final word on
the alcohol policy. During the
next few weeks Dean Terry willbe
seeking suggestions and input from
student-faculty groups such as the
CCRL, the Student Conduct Coun-
cil, the SGA, and the PCC.

‘Davideon Graduate
Articulates His
Art Of Articulation

- By Jeff Oller

On Tuesday, as a part of the
year-long Alumni Lecture Series,
Class of ’77 member Tony Snow,
Chief Speech writer for President
Bush, shared his views on the in-
tense rigors of Washington D. C.,
the state of the United States and

’ some of the experiences he has had
as the “fly on the wall” amongst
our nation’s politics.

Snow, hired to his present
position by John Sununu, began
with an extensive commentary on
Washington. , He maintained that
ournation’s capitol offered the best
and worst of American culture
while, simultaneously, living like
an island from the rest of the United
States. Washington and Congress,

he asserted, indeed hold the last
refuges of scoundrels. ““Washing-
ton,” he joked, “is said to provide
the best in Northern hospitality
and Southern efficiency.”

He outlined three tips for sur-
viving D.€. First, he said, was to
not take friendship personally
because the city is status essential,
class conscience and self-segre-
gated. For example, he said, on the
President's private jet, Air Force

One, the President rides up front in -

his spacious and luxurious com-
partment. His chief executives
ride in a compartment behind him
that is only slightly less comfort-

‘able. Behind the executives are

two compartments for staff. The
first is significantly less luxurious
than the executives, and the sec-
ond, the furthest back of all the
compartments, is worse than the
first staff compartment. In sum-
mation to his first tip, Snow main-
tained, “It’s not who you know in
Washington, but what you are.”

His second tip was the fact
that, in D.C., the urgent over-
whelms the important. The Capi-
tol, Snow maintained, survives on
what hecalls “crisisoxygen.” This
means that the energy and adrenal-
ine that people need to get through
an average day in Washington
comes from the presence of con-
stant crisis, whether real or imag-
ined.

Every day in Washington, he
said, starts with the morning edi-
tions. The most feared and re-.
spected of all journalists are those,
that are ruthlessly accurate. Ac-
cording to Snow, “In politics, sur-

The reasons behind this new .

alcohol policy are that the Trustees
and Dean Terry believe that the
current design is not working and
alcohol abuse is a very serious and
prevalent problem at Davidson.
Dean: Terry said, “I sense we are
sitting on a powder keg and some-
thing could happen down there any
night and we would all be in duck
soup, including the houses...”
Terry wrote eight policy ob-
jectives in the report. They are:

‘1.To provide campus-wide
information concerning state law
regarding the use of alcohol;

2. To encourage student re-
sponsibility for their behavior re-
garding the consumption of alco-
hol as prescribed by college regu-
lations, set forth in this policy;

3. To encourage a campus cli-
mate which does not tolerate alco-
hol abuse;

4. To change the social expec-

tations of the campus and develop:

Davidson Student
Organizes Russian Aid Program

By Tom Price

Oleg Ordinartsev,an exchange
student from Pyatigorsk, Russia ,
has collaborated with Davidson
College Presbyterian Church in
creating an aid program which will
provide food for need Russians.
The program hopes to send 5-8
tons of food to Pyatigorsk by the
first week in April.

The program is an historic first
because it involves direct aid from
one small American church to
smail Russian church: As far as
can determined, no other effort of

_ this type has ever been attempted.

In the past, all relief efforts
have been centered in the large
cities of Russia such as Moscow
and Leningrad. Ordinartsev said
that direct aid to his community is
important in order to avoid the
extensive black market which of-
ten prevents the proper distribu-
tion of aid efforts.

Ordinartsev first conceived the
idea during the Christmas worship
services at DCPC. He then con-
,tacted Rosemary Raynal, who was

and she enlisted ‘the help of her
husband, the preacher at DCPC.

concerning the use and abuse of

Working out the logistics for
the program was a long frustrating
process forRosemary Raynal. She
first tried calling various relief
agencies. These organizations, she
said, either wanted money or would

Next she tried to gain assistance
from the U.S. military. The Rayn-
als were unable to get past the
intracacies of military protocol
until they asked Col. Moncure, a

On January 27, Nancy Cable-
Wells, presently dean of students

sions and Financial Aid. A com-
mittee composed of student, fac-
ulty , administrative, alumni, and
trustee representatives chose her

Excited to have the opportu-

nity to workat Davidson, she wants
to become familiar with all cam-

pus constituencies. “I want to take -

time to learn Davidson, and then

make recommendations if there

need to be any,” Cable-Wells said

in response to questions of priori-
ties in the admissions office.

Since late 1987, Cable-Wells

has worked in all areas of student

_ life at Guilford, including student

recruitment and admissions, ath-

letics, and programs for student
development. Recently she has
been part of a planning team fo-
cused on forecasting for higher
education, tracing the trends and
outside forces which impact col-
leges.

At Denison Liniventity for ten
years prior to her present position,

Medical Humanities Speaker Offers
Understanding of AIDS Physician Dilemma

By Chris Wells

On Tuesday, as part of the
Medical Humanities Lecture Se-
ries, Dr. Abigail Zuger spoke on
the ethical dilemma of whether
physicians havea moral obligation
to treat AIDS patients.

Zuger said that in the last ten
years, research has established two,

where a majority of doctors con-
sistently stated that they would not
treat AIDS patients if given a
choice. Zuger concluded that there
is “a pattern of disinclinations”
which includes a risk to the physi-
cian’s health and family, a risk to

the physician’s livelihood, and a
feeling that the patients will not
recover.

She continued by citing his-

The other is that many doctors are

‘In light of these certainties,
Zuger asked, “‘...are health care
