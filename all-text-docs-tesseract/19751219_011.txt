“Aftersunrise”

Shumak

By BARBARA PAYNE
Staff Writer

The works of Rita Shumaker, on
display in the Union Gallery through
Dec. 19, contain blatant statements
on the oppressions of womanhood.

Symbols of fertility and of the
woman’s reproductive tract are preva-
lent throughout the exhibit. Shuma-
ker’s painting ‘‘Metamorphosis’’
depicts a woman who is seemingly
attempting some heavenward tran-
spiration, with arms outstretched and
eyes turned toward the sky.

At her sides hang two large, dark
brown ovaries which appear to be
acting as weights. The- remainder of
the painting is bright yellow and
green.

““Tsis’’, a photographic essay,
carries the obvious connatations of
fertility. Shumaker uses the contour
of the egg frequently; it is found in
her paintings ‘‘Crack in the Cosmic
Egg, ‘‘Thoth”’ and in two of her batik
wall-hangings.

“‘Herself’’, depicts a woman in front
of several triangular structures.
These traingles could very well sym-
bolize the hearth and the home, and
Shumaker places woman in her'“‘pro-
per and fitting’’ place.

Almost all of the paintings in the

exhibit deal with some aspect of
womanhood, the only exception being
“Reflections”, which focuses on phal-
lic symbolization. There is an inter-
esting change of approach to this
painting as Shumaker utilizes a
highly geometric design, contrasting
the more fluid style in the remainder
of her works. i
Shumaker’s faces have little indivi-
dual character and hence seem to be
universally identifiable. Faces often
appear in three’s, each face overlap-

ping another and no face being totally
definable.

Her painting “Autumn. Journey-
man”’ could be the saga of any man’s
journey. Shumaker gives her subject
a face of no description--yet that face
remains the focal point through the
use of colour and contrast of shape.

The painting entitled “Thoth” is
particularly intriguing. An Egyptian
deity, Thoth was the eldest son of the
sun-god Re. According to Egyptian

Eyes of bridge world focus toward
forthcoming Davidson tournament

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Executive Editor

Beginning in January Davidson
College students may find themselves
playing cards for money. The stakes
are $200 $100 and $50 scholarships
and the game is duplicate bridge.

The American Contract Bridge
League is sponsoring a bridge tourna-
ment, at Davidson College and at
Queens College. The goal is to
increase awareness and interest in
bridge on college campuses across the

country.

“The ACBL is sponsoring our
tournament as an experiment. We are
the only college who, along with

‘Queens will have a tournament like

this.

“The eyes of the bridge world will
be on us. If the tournament is
successful and a lot of students
participate then the ACBL might
sponsor other tournaments and will
certainly increase the prize money in
the future,’’ said Junior Mike Russ
who is coordinating the tournament.

Russ hopes to have 15 tables of
bridge involved in each session. This
would involve having 60 decks of
cards on hand because in duplicate
bridge, everyone plays the same
hand.

“We will need about 60 decks of
cards and the various scoreboards so
that we can be official. Bill Woodson,
the president of the Charlotte chapter
of the ACBL is going to provide us
these things,’’ said Russ.

Woodson is the man who devised

the idea of having a bridge tourna- -

ment in the colleges.

“Mr. Woodson is a special man. He
has made all of this possible for us.
The only thing the school will have to
buy ‘is refreshments. The Union
games committee is. doing that for
us,” said Russ.

Interest in bridge at Davidson is
high.

“A lot of people play before dinner
down at the houses here,’’ said Russ.
‘‘We have had five or six tables for
tournaments over in the Honors
center once a week all Fall term. I
think these people are the hard core
bridge players, but I also believe that
a lot more people will show up to play
for money,’ continued Russ.

The tournament begins on January
ninth and will continue until Febru-
ary. To qualify for prizes, a player
must play at least six hands and no
more than nine. He can only have the
same partner for four hands.

“You have to be versatile to win.
There are a lot of good bridge players
at Davidson and I hope they can come
out because the whole bridge world
will be looking at us,’’ concluded
Russ.

er symbolizes womanhood

folklore, Thoth would appear in
human form with the. head of an ibis
when issuing proclamaions or when
performing some sacred task.

Shumaker portrays the birth of
Thoth--of the split eggshell (he was
born an ibis) and his moon-identity.
He holds a transparent moon-like disc
under each arm (again, perhaps
depicting a woman’s ovaries) and his
broad feather headdress is representa-
tive of the fallopian tubes. The
painting on the whole looks somewhat
like a sixth grade sex-education chart.

Shumaker frequently employs the
technique of emphasizing her subject
by painting it in white or grey and by
setting it against a dark or brightly
coloured background. In ‘‘Mist Rise
After Rain’, she sets a solidified grey
mist against a bright blue back-
ground--an interesting interpretation
of such a nondescript, shapeless
mass.

Bilateral symmetry is common to
all of Shumaker’s work, and is
particularly noticeable in her wall-
hangings. Her colour schemes are
varied, ranging from the offensive to
the delightfully subtle.

Symbolism is the main key to
understanding Shumaker’s ideas,
mythological symbolism being often
used. Suggestions of literary symbo-
lism can be found in ‘‘After Sunrise’.
The prominent place of a rose in the
painting could be analogous to Yeats’
rose, the image of life, of perfection
and of eternal beauty.

Generally speaking, Shumaker.
takes an eclectic approach. She works
both in acrylics and watercolours, in
batik, macrame and weaving, and
does a great deal of photography. Her
water-colour technique, however,
seems to carry the greatest amount of
personal expression.

The macrame-weaving combina-
tions (the ‘“‘Abandoned Cage’”’ and
“Last Year’s Nest’’) are stereotypes
and hence rather ineffective as artistic
statement. :

Shumaker’s wall hangings success-
fully employ an interesting combina-
tion of quilting and batik, showing
good understanding of design and
textural effect.

Her efforts in photography should
probably remain classified as efforts;
ideas are not exemplified as well as
those in her paintings.

Shumaker’s acrylic technique is
good; but in some cases reverts to a
water-colour style, not fully realizing
the potential of acrylics. In these
paintings she works with a ‘‘stroke’”’
effect-- a jvery abrupt, interrupted
application of paint to the canvas.
