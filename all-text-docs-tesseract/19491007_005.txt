tion of the group which has ruled
the country for nearly seventeen
years, There are many, undoubted-
ly, who are deserving of permanent
relief, but there are’ many more,
parasites who take such relief not
because they have to, but because
they haven’t the intestinal fortitude
to do for themselves what others
are doing who are in far worse
circumstances than they. The ad-
ministration of the plan has been
its prime evil. To cater to such
parasites, to take the money of
those who are working to provide
for their own future, to make wards
of the government of such “doers”
in order that those who do nothing
may have the rewards of the work
they have not done, is a monstrous
and heinous crime against the
honest taxpayer in the name of
charity.

5. The use of public credit and of
the fiscal machinery to offset the
stagnation of private enterprise and
to stabilize the economy and main-
tain employment at a permanenily
high level. Once the government
interferes, it makes necessary more
interference .and still more inter-
ference. For government to try to
control and guide. something so
vast and incomprehensible as the
economic system is analagous to a
man who knows nothing of clocks
and decides to repair his timepiece.
He takes off the back, peers in,
decides he sees what is the matter,
and jams in a crowbar. The clock
runs no better; in fact, it runs much
worse, so he makes further efforts
at repair. Each effort produces a
new injury which in turn requires
further meddling. In the end the
clock lies broken on the table and
what ran tolerably well before,
even though not perfectly, now does
not run at all. The government is
characterized by this would-be
clock fixer perfectly. For the yov-
ernment has never run any business
at a profit in its history; and yet
it proposes to take a vast economiic
system, correct all of its faults,

and produce the perfect system. Ifjto regard the past measures of the

‘BETA THETA PI

Once again, as the student hady
begins to settle down to the old
grind, Phi Alpha’s sons of Wooghs
get straightened out: after a hectic
opening week and begin to organize
and swing into action. Two weeks
ago, a contingent of six journeyed
to West Point in Brother Francis
Pepper's joy wagon. They spent
one night at the home of Brother
Tom Allen in Bethlehem, Penn.,
drove up to the game on Saturday,
and then returned to N.Y.G. The
only incident worthy of mention
which. reached our ears occurred
when Brother Thad Munroe thor.
oughly doused the proprictor of a
Gotham banana cart with the re-
sults, an indigestible hamburger.
Last week end, the house was ov-
erflowing with beautiful young
ladies and the familiar faces of
many alumni including past presi-
dent Al Scarborough, all of whom
we were delighted to have.

With the return of intra-mural
athletics, Beta Theta.Pi fields one
of the strongest teams which she
has had in several seasons. With
guards and ends five deep and
three good centers, a fast back-
field of experienced blockers should
go a tong way. Beta’s initial vic-
tory over the Campus Club is not
an accurate indication of things to
tome, because neither team was
polished to any degree; however,
before too many days, we hope to
be in top notch shape. Brother
Murray Ashman is doing a fine job
in his capacity as athlete manager.

Congratulations are in order for
both Phi Alpha and two new broth-
ers: Tommy Cranford and Roy Da-
vis. These two fellows, pledged
early this year, have just complet-
ed their respective informal and
formal initiations and have been
welcomed into the brotherhood of
Beta Theta Pi,
