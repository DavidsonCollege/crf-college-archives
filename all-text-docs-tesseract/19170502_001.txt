Many Davidson Men
Take Officers’ Exam.

Davidson will furnish her full quota
to the Officers’ Training Camp at Fort
Oglethorpe this summer. Already a
large number have signified their desire
to enlist. Those men who have made
application and who went to Charlotte
Monday to stand the final test before an
Army officer are: A. C. Wood, R. D.
Walker, B. D. Roddey, R. C. Jones,
D. M. Therrell, L. M. Johnson, B. N.
White. N. L. Armistead, J. C. Paisley,
J. B. Pharr, H. B. Fraser, R. T. Car-
roll, J. L. Fountain, 8. R. Keesler, W.
P. Keesler, S. M. Crisp, J. M. Black
and H. F. Mayfield. Several others
have applied but found it impossible to
go to Charlotte Monday. They will
be passed upon some time this week.
The camp will open at Fort Oglethorpe
May 14. Several men enlisted last
week, in the Coast Artillery division.

Military drill is seill characterized by
the same readiness and enthusiasm of the
students. No diminishing in the number
drilling has been noticed as yet.

The two separate companies are be-
ing put thru the finer points of squad
movement. The desire of the student
officers is to give a general knowledge
of drill movements to those students par-
ticipating by commencement. Whether
compulsory military drill is adapted at
Davidson will depend upon the faculty
and the War Department. Nothing
definite will be known for some time.

FULL COMMENCEMENT
EXERCISES TO BE HELD

It was the plan of the faculty that on
account of the existing state of war, thc
Commencement exercises should — be
much simpler this vear than usual, and
all unnecessary social functions should
he left off. The Senior class. which has
heen waiting during these four years for
Commencement. decided to petition the
faculty that the usual program he fol-
lowed. The faculty finally decided that
the regular Commencement — shall be
held excent for the fact that the exer-
cises will begin on Saturday night with
the meeting of the societies, and close
Tuesday at noon with the Senior
sneeches and the awarding of — the
diplomas. In other words, the Com-
mencement exercises will be the same as
usual, only they will not last as long as
heretofore.

STEEL FILAG POLE
TO BE ERECTED SOON

Davidson is to have a steel flag pole.
The sections of timber secured for the
pole have been found defective. Much
shaping and dressing only went to prove
them unfit for a permanent flag pole.
The Senior class. donator of the pole to
the college. and the faculty, decided
that a steel flag pole would be better and
more lasting. It is being made at Char-
lotte now. This steel flag pole will be
115 feet high. with reversable top and
wire ropes for the raising or lowerine of
a 30. foot flag. The concrete base
foundation will not be altered. Owing
to a slight delav the flag nnle. due to
have arrived last week, will not be rais-
ed till the last of the week.

GOOD WEATHER HELPS
WORK ON GYMNASIUM

The foundation for the new gvm is
being rapidly pushed forward. When
the laying of brick began last Tuesday,
all doubts as to its reality faded away.
The making of mortar and the wielding
of the trowel suggest comoletion and a
finished gym by fall. Good weather
conditions have aided the workmen the
past week, and the progress has been
satisfying.

Plumbing for the sewerage is being
roughed into the foundation. The work
on the foundation will continue thruout
the week.

Georgia Defeated
In Pitchers’ Duel

Last Game of Season is Won By
Red and Black.

Davidson closed her abbreviated but
successful baseball season on last Wed-
nesday at Sprunt Field, defeating the
strong University of Georgia team by a
score of'2-1. “The game was by far the
fastest and most exciting exhibition
staged on the local field this year and
was indeed a fitting climax to the 1917
season,

The game was a pitcher's battle be
tween Hengeveld and Satterfield. “Whe
former was in his best: form, allowing
but two hits, and but for an error would
have scored a shut-out victory. After
the first inning, when an error, coupled
with an infield hit and a single by Woot-
en, resulted ina tally, the big Dutchman
was more than effective.

Satterfield, for the Georgians, show-
ed splendid stuff and struck out eight of
the Davidson hitters, but bunched hits
in two innings ‘proved his downfall.
Having failed to tie the score in the first
inning, Davidson came back strong in
the second. McMillan, the first man
up, tripled over the right fielder’s head.
Satterfield’s curves were too much for
Singleton, and he struck out. Saunders
singled sharply to center and McMillan
scored. ‘This ended Davidson's, scoring
until the eighth, when Hengeveld  sin-
gled, took second on. Johnson's sacrifice,
went to third on Black’s single, and
scored on a single by McKinnon.

Both teams played good ball in’ the
field, Georgia going thru the contest
crrorless. Davidson made several mis-
plays, but only one proved costly. Raw-
son caught an especially nice. game for
Georgia. Saunders accepted 14 chances
without an error, for Davidson. ‘The
feature of the afternoon in the slugging
line was McMillan’s three-bagger.
