One-Point Losses Plague Cat Harriers

By MARK CONNORS
Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidson Cross Country
team, although sporting one of
the best teams in recent years,
has had its fill of disap-
pointments, losing three meets
in the past two weeks by one
point.

On Oct. 5, the Cat harriers
dropped its first one pointer to
The Citadel. It was the best
showing the Cats have made
against the Bulldogs in several

years, yet it just wasn't quite
enough as #1 man for The
Citadel Nick Pugh led his team
to a 29-30 win.

The first Davidson finisher
was Freshman Coty Pickney,
who finished fourth overall.

Other standouts for Davidson
included Jeff Neikirk, Jesse
Smith and John Barksdale.

Coming off this first one-point
defeat, the Cats returned to
Davidson for the five way meet
with Wake Forest, St. Andrews,

Linard Takes Role
Of Offensive Spark

By LYNNE KEENER
Staff Writer
This soccer season marks
Jack Linard’s seventh straight

year of participation in the
sport.
After four years of high

school soccer in Indianapolis,
the skilled junior is currently an
offensive striker.

Linard believes his out-
Standing attributes in this
position are his speed and
medium build. These qualities
enable him to ‘‘break away and
simply outrun the other team’s
defense.”

Previously, he avoided direct
contact with his opponents, but
he has changed to a more
physical playing style in order
to gain respect from the op-
position.

Linard feels, ‘‘My duty is to
score, especially with Tom Tor-
nee unable to play due to injury
and with so few upperclassmen
on the team.”’

Linard, the team's leading
scorer, admits the team had
been in a slump (partially
caused by the rough schedule - 6
games in 12 days) until the Ap-
palachian contest two weeks

0.

Although Tommy Blackwood
is very versatile, the team
really has no star to guide his
fellow teammates. Con-
sequently, the individual
players have hesitated to define
their roles on the field, resulting

in inconsistent play this year.

As Linard states, ‘‘Gradually,
the team will gel if the inex-
perienced defense does not let
up.

The recent Furman game, in
which Linard scored the Wild-
Cats’ winning goal, seems tosup-
port this analysis.

The three weeks of initial
practice seemed physically and
mentally enough preparation
for facing the tough Conference
contenders in the agenda’s top
section in addition to several
ACC opponents.

In fact, Linard claims, ‘I en-
joy competing against superior
teams, which is one reason I
chose Davidson three years
ago.”

Linard views no involvement
in soccer after he graduates. In-
stead, he merely plays now for
fun, and in order to ‘‘give me

Gardner-Webb, and Campbell.

After the five mile run was
done, Davidson had defeated
three of its opponents and lost
to Wake by another one point.

Head Coach Sterling Martin
commented, ‘‘We were very
pleased with the meet but it was
disappointing to lose by only
one point again.”

Standouts for Davidson for
the Five way included Rick
Bell, Bob Lautensack, and Bill
Cole.

‘Bell had his best race of the
season,”’ said Matin. He added,
“Bob (Lautensack) and Bill
(Cole) both did very com-
mendable jobs. It was the first
this year that they've broken in-
to the top positions on the team.

Once again, Jeff Neikirk did a
very good job along with Jeese
Smith.

Coming off this second one-
point disappointment, the
harriers met V.M.I. and W & L
last Monday in Lexington, Va.

Martin commented, ‘‘We had
high hopes of beating both
teams and kept these hopes
right up until we saw the cour-
se.

It was the most severe cross
country course I’ve seen. Ap-

proximately 2'2 miles of the
course was on a path that only
had enough room for a single
file line and it was quite slip-
pery.””

The team ended up losing
another by one point as they
dropped to W & L 27-28.

In addition, VMI topped
Davidson 22-23. Martin felt that
the team would have done a
great deal better if they had run
the two teams on another cour-
se.

Number one finisher for
Davidson was Jesse Smith.

‘*] just can’t say enough about
Jesse. He had an outstanding
day,’’ said Martin.

‘“‘If the course had been bet-
ter, I think Jesse could've
broken up the pack which could
have affected the outcome of
the meet.”’

Another outstanding per-

formance was made_by Jeff
Neikirk.

‘Jeff had a super race,” said
Martin. In addition Rick ‘the
lube’ Deal broke into the top
five for Davidson for the first
time this year.

“It was a particularly good
race for Lube, and he's one of
the few guys on the team that

still is completely healthy,”
commented Martin.

Although the Cats have had
some bad times in the past two
weeks on the cross country cir-
cuit, they hope to face these
teams again in the next few
weeks.

Martin is optimistic that they
can come out on top the second
time around.

The next meet for the Wild-
cats is today at 2 p.m. when the
Davidson harriers face a strong
Richmond team.

It will be the first time that
Davidson will run a six mile
course this year. A five mile run
has been the customary distan-
ce.

“Richmond should be real
tough,” said Martin.

“They have four freshmen
recruits and two junior college
transfers that could pose a real
threat to us.

‘They weren't too strong last
year, but with all this new
material, it could be a whole dif-
ferent story.

“In fact, they beat VMI quite
badly last week. “If this is any
indication, the meet Friday will
be a real tough one.’ Martin
concluded

Greenville Hammers Out 16-7

Rugby Victory Over Davidson

By ANN BODE
Staff Writer

Sunday the Davidson College
Rugby Club travelled to Green-
ville where they were deteated
by a surprisingly strong. ex
perienced Greenville team by a
score of 16-7

Davidson ruggers, within the
first minutes of the game, gave
up a try due to the extreme
shortness of the playing field

The pitch provided by the
Greenvilleclub was only 75 yards
as opposed to the regulation
120 yards. ~

After this initial unsureness,
the Davidson squad stiffened
and allowed only two more tries
the rest of the game.

Greenville’s offensive
machine was spurred on mainly
by the effectiveness of their pin-
point punting and by the strong
determination of their powerful
screen.

Davidson's scoring was ac-
complished by the scrum taking
advantage from well-played
Davidson foot rushes which ef-
fectively moved the ball down
the field.

Team captain Ted Ellett
drove the ball across the touch
line for one Davidson try. Dave
Kitrell scored 3 points with a

This lack of offense proved to

team to one or two tries. You ve
