Sunday Evening

Ham and Billie Present Views of
World’s Needs in Striking Way.

‘At the “Y” service last Sunday even-
ing George Bellingrath, ’18, delivered a
most ,instructive and impressive illus-
trated lecture concerning the crying
needs of the heathen world for the ap-
plication of the teachings and prin-
ciples of Jesus Christ.

“Billie” first gave a short talk on
“What Constitutes a Call to the Min-
istry?” He said that Moses, Paul, and
the other great Bible characters had
been called by God in some miraculous
wdy, but now a man who sees the need
of a sin-stricken world, and is ready
and willing to help spread the Gospel
.of Christ, has received the call. He also
stated that the whole world is lost in
sin and that the only remedy lies in the
Bible. Reading from the first chapter
of Acts, he stressed that part of the
eighth verse which says, “And ye shall
be witnesses unto me,” adding that a
minister was a witness for Christ.

In the stereoptican views which fol-
lowed, the conditions existing in several
heathen countries, and some very strik-
ing facts concerning them were shown.
That two-thirds of the human race is
unchristianized is a condition that very
few have ever considered. The pictures
illustrated the evil effects of the Cath-
olic religion on South America and how
Christ-is the only hope for the people.

From South America, the setting was
shifted to Asia and the outlying islands.
The pictures showed how the heathen
crowds, in their ignorance, had flocked
to the temple to find relief in gods of
wood and stone, when there was none
to be had. Thirty years from now there
will.be one hundred million more people
in China than there are now. Many are
at this time living on bark and leaves.
What will it be then?

The speaker informed the audience
that there were in India alone one thou-
sand and ninety-seven languages. In
New York, Bibles printed in sixty differ-
ent languages are used. If Christ had
started visiting the villages of India
while He was here, and had visited one
village every day down to the present
time, He would still have thirty thousand
villages to visit. The gold which lines
a certain Hindu tomb shown, is worth
more than all the money which the
Protestant churches of our country have

" given to the missionary cause.

Bellingrath stated that northern Af-
rica has been almost covered by the
Mohammedan religion, because in the
early days there was a division in the
Christian Church there. He also stated
that from the Mohammedan Seminary
at Cairo, Egypt, ten thousand men grad-
uated every year as missionaries of that
faith; while at the Union Theological
Seminary, the largest’ Presbyterian semi-
nary in the South, there.are only one
hundred men, and that only one of ev-
ery seventy-six ministers goes to the
foreign field.

The “Song of the Continent” was then
sung from the screen. After this, Mr.
Bellingrath closed the meeting with a
word of prayer.

E. H. Hamilton, ’17, operated the ma-

chine in a very efficient manner.

Wildkittens Pile Up 31-0
Score Against Prep Team

Scrubs Wallop Charlotte Univer-
sity School Men.

The Davidson Wildkittens returned
from’ Charlotte with the scalp of the
Charlotte University School in their pos-
session. They romped away with the
“prep” school boys to the merry tune of
31 to o, and the Presbyterian goal was
never in danger, while their backs ran
wild. The Kittens opened up with the
usual Red and Black fight, and com-
pletely swept the Charlotte lads off their
feet in the first half, scoring four touch-
downs in this period. The University
School boys came backwith lots of pep
in the last half, and held the collegians
to one lone touchdown, although the
Scrubs’ machine swept down the field
time and time again by pretty end runs
and line plunges. Coach McFadden's
Scrubs looked good in their first en-
counter and are going to give any high
school team:in the state a mighty tough
fight. Brown and DeArmon ran wild and
could be depended on to make first
down at any time; the former tore off
1§ yards around end many times, while
the Charlotte lad registered three touch-
downs for the Collegians. Moore and
Boggs also showed up well, while Craw-
ford and Overton did good work for the
Scrubs.

The whole Davidson line put up a
game fight and very few yards were the
losers able to gain through the stone
wall.

C. Miller was the star of the Char-
lotte aggregation, making several good

fains. The line-up and summary:

‘Church Members Witness
Pictures on Child Life

Evening Church Service Held in
Shearer Hall.

The regular Sunday evening church
service was conducted last Sunday by
Mr. E. H. Hamilton, 717. The lecture,
which was well illustrated by stereop-
tican pictures shown by Mr. Bellingrath,
was given in Shearer Hall because of
the electric current in the church being
unsuited to the picture machine. In
addition to a large number of town
people, about one-half of the student
body was present. ;

Mr. Hamilton, using as his text “The
Children of the World,” selected Matt.
18:5 as the key verse, “Whoso shall re-
ceive one such little child in my name
receiveth me.” Among the many start-
ling facts brought out were the follow-
ing:

Only two per cent of the students of
the universities of South America are
Christians.

In Japan only ‘one person out of every
§22 is a Christian. In China 93 per cent
of the people can neither read nor write.

As a result of the Hindoo influence in
India, which teaches that girls should
marry under 12 years of age, there are
300,000 wives under five years of age, 2,-
000,050 between , five and ten, and 6,500,-
ooo between ten and fifteen. Unless we
send the Bread of Life to the 90,000,000
children under ten years of age in India,
in only a few years this vast number ‘of
souls will become blighted by Hindooism
and heathenism. In the world there are
eighty million Mohammedan children.

The bloom of youth has no chance to
progress either in this world or in the
world to come unless we,send them the
Gospel. We should help fulfill Christ's
last command in three ways:

First: Pray ye therefore the Lord of
the harvest that He will send forth
laborers into his harvest.

Second: Dedicate your children to the
service of God.

Third: Invest your life where it will
count for the most. Say, “Here am I,
send me.”

Probably the most impressive part of
the service was the singing of “From
Greenland’s Icy. Mountains,” and “I
Gave My Life for Thee." As they were
sung appealing pictures were shown,
which fitted in well with words of the

songs.
In closing the service a plea was made
for the reconsecration of lives to

Christ in the service in which each life
can best serve Him, in answer to which
practically the whole audience arose.

OUTLOOK BRIGHT
FOR GOOD YEAR

The Dramatic Club is starting off with
prospects for the best year it has ever
had, and, with Professor Erwin ‘direct-
ing, it looks forward to a bright and
rosy future.

It starts, off its program for the year
with a minstrel November 19th, which
ought to be nifty, judging from the per-
formance of last year.

Professor Erwin has been working
on some new ideas and has several
novelties on the string. Clyburne is on
the lookout for all the dancing artists
on the Hill and the Freshman class
ought to be able to fill the places of the
men who graduated last year. On the
musical side, Buchanan and McGeachy
are working hard on some snappy music
and songs. There is some real good
talent in the Freshman class that only
needs to be brought out. A delegation is

BLUE RIDGE DELEGATES TO
SPEAK AT YMCA ON SUNDAY

The Davidson delegates to Blue Ridge
will discuss the aims and purposes of
that conference "before the Y. M. C. A‘!
next Sunday night. The purpose of this |
meeting will be not so much to give a
picture of the organization and schedule
of the conference, as to shaw the need!
for some place where college men may |
meet each other and exchange ideas, and!
where they may receive the inspiration
of meeting and hearing the great reli-
gious leaders of the country,

The following Sunday, the Y. M.C. A.
hopes to secure Dr. Sykes, the president
of Coker College, Dr. Sykes played foot-
ball four years at Wake Forest, and will
probably come up to see the Wake For-
est game.

Basketball Enthneiacts

Prepare For Class Games

Sixty Men Struggling for Positions
on Class Teams.

The prospects for class basketball are
great. Every one on the campus is tak-
ing a great deal of interest in it, and all
things seem to point to a fine season for
interclass basketball. More interest is
displayed in class basketball than any
other class athletics on the hill.

The Fresh have about 30 men out and
seem to be going after class honors in
éarnest, Coach Pat Crawford has not
been able to thin them down enough to
tell just what kind of material is out, but
it is rumored that they have some fast
material,

The Soph team has shown very little
promise so far, but may develop into a
good squad under the direction of Man-
ager Speck McConnell. The following
men are out: McConnell, Elkins, Mc-
Bryde, McPherson, Bradford, Currie,
Beaver, White, Ed. Brown, Charnley.

The prospects for the Junior team are
very good. Most of their last year’s
men will be seen on the squad as well as
some new material. George Mauze is
the manager as well as a tower of
strength on the floor. The following
men are out for the team: Mauze,
Houghton, Brake, Bostick, Toney, Brad-
Jey, Covington, Calhoun, Roberts, and
Elliott.

According to advance dope, it would
seem that the Seniors are going to win
the flag for the third consecutive year,
having lost the championship by only
two points their Fresh year. Afi of last
year’s team is back with the exception
of Luke Erwin, who is starring on the
gridiron, Manager Price will doubtless
substitute Freeman for Erwin on guard.
Shorty Cornelson will jump center, Capt.
Ormand and Ray Doubles will be the
forwards. ‘Others out for the team are:
Neal, Brown, aiid McCrary.

The schedule is as follows:

Sophs vs. Fresh, October 7th.

Seniors vs. Juniors, October 11th.

Seniors vs, Fresh, October 14th.

Juniors vs, Sophs, October 18th.

Juniors vs, Fresh, October -aist.

Seniors vs. Sophs, October 25th.

Sophs vs. Fresh, October 28th.

Seniors vs. Juniors, November Ist.

Seniors vs, Fresh, November, 4th.

Juniors vs. Sophs, November 8th.

Juniors vs. Fresh, November 11th.

Seniors vs. Sophs, November 15th.

It will be noticed that the first game
is Friday night between the Sophs and
Fresh. Both classes should turn out en
masse to support their teams.

Davidson Eleven Defeats
Presbyterian College 7-0

Bluestockings Fight Gamely With
Their Backs to Wall.

By completely outclassing
ponents at every stage of the game,
Davidson easily defeated Presbyterian
College ‘last Friday 7 to o. The Wild-
cats outweighed their kinsmen and
Coach Grey’s Flying Squadron showed
their superiority early in the game. The
Red and Black Machine got the jump
on their opponents at the start, but the
Blue Stockings put up their accustomed
plucky fight.

Moore scored the toughdown late ‘in
the third quarter. Hiendman fumbled
cr his own 20 yard line and Brice re-
covered the ball. An eleven yard pass
and several line plays put the ball on
the 2-yard line. Moore then carried the
oval across on an end run. Schenck
kicked goal.

Moore and Sclienck were the individ-
ual stars for Davidson. Again and
again Spratt, the midget back, tore off
long gains around the ends. He gained
a total of 94 yards while he was in the
game. Schenck also put up a limelight
performance. He was on the receiving
end of seven passes that gained a total
of 76 yards. He was also a mainstay on
defence. On the six attempted runs
around his end, P. C. lost five yards.
Three times they were turned back
without a gain, once they lost one yard,
and twice they lost two yards.

The Clinton lads did not get within
hailing distance of the Davidson goal

her op-

line. Their nearest advance to the
Wildcat base of operations with the
ball in-their possession was to their

own 47-yard line. Their only first down
was a gift, resulting from a Davidson
penalty. The Wildcats made first down
12 times. :

The Big Red team was twice within
teach of the South Carolinians’ goal
line, but both times forward passes were
grounded in the end zone.

Ervin kicked off for P. C. at the open-
ing, and after failing to gain in three
attempts on the line, Durant punted. The
Wildcats quickly made three first downs,
a 19-yard pass to Schenck featuring, but
two 15-yard penalties slowed them -up.
P. C. held on their 21-yard line and Du-
rant punted out of danger. Just before
the quarter ended, Moore stepped around
right end for fifteen yards.

Again failing in a running attack, Du-
rant attempted to punt. Clark block-
ed it and Hunter recovered the ball.
Again the Red and Black machine start-
ed down the field but again P. C. held on
