THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 24, 1927

ALUMNI ADDRESSES

Within the next few weeks David-
son College students will receive a card
from the Alumni Secretary, asking
that they come by the office. Several
of them have already responded to his
request. The purpose is to go over
the list of alumni in the home towns
of each sttident, obtain new addresses
from them and perhaps add numerous
alumni to the present mailing list. That
studetits can assist the Secretary in a
great way has already been indicated
by the results obtained from the stu-
dents who have been asked to come by.

W. F. Stephens Speaks

to Students at Vespers

Brother of Famous Evangelist
| Emphasizes the Personal
Christ

“IT am never, under any circumstances,
ashamed of the Word of Jesus,” declared W.
I, Stephens, theological student in McCor-
mick Theological Seminary, and brother .of
|the great evangelist, in the opening of his

| talk before the “Y” Sunday night.

Stephens opened his talk by saying that he
would use no text, but talk to the students

|as any college mate would talk to his fellow
|men. He talked of a great man, an humble
| man, Jésus Christ, telling of the life char-
| acteristics of our Saviour, stating that Christ
| was an humble man’ ¢onie ifito the world to |
| reveal God to us in an every-day manner.

| He again made the statement that, “I have
/no doubt of His dignity, which He attained
| by His humaneness.” ,He endeavored to pre-
| sent Christ as an every-day helpmate of man-
| kind.

| Stephens then plunged farther into his |
| apecot enumerating the facts of Christ's
| divinity. The Old Testament is full of the |
| promises of the coming Messiah. He pic-
tured Him as the beginning and the end of |
everything; the essence of loving kindness,
which is exemplified in the little deeds that
Christ performed. |

He illustrated the way in which Christ |
opens Himself to examination, by the story |
of Von Hindenburg, the German president. |
Von Hindenburg came to the German presi- |
dency, retaining the Socialist leaders on his |
staff, so that his opposing party ‘might see
and hear everything that he did. So Christ
came among the Pharisees to be examined,
yet with all of their blasphemy, they were
able to find nothing wrong with Him.

“Christ is not surrounded by a cloud of
mystery,” said Stephens. “He reveals Him-
self to us in a most natural way. Christ is
a mystery to those that are sinners, but He
is a loving brother to the converted sinner.
Stephens remarked, that Christ was not
mostly with the true Christian, but with the
greatest, blackest and most degraded sinner,
who needs Him more. Even when you think
yourself too sinful to be in the presence of
God, He has His loving arms around you,
pleading with you. Stephens placed the pur-
pose of the church today at this point, “Love
the bad man,”

Since God is better understood when re-
vealed in a natural way, Christ makes it His
mission to reveal God to man in a natural
way. Therefore the part of a Christian is
to assent and to follow. When you try to
follow Christ He will lend a helping hand
and an encouraging word.

The speaker said the student of today, amid
the greatest advantages. of any time, has two
channels in which to go. One, the popular
channel in which the student prepares himself
for leisure and mercenary gain; the other, in|
which the student grasps every advantage to |
fit himself for a position of service. In the |
latter channel the student has to face Christ
and bring Him into his lifé in order to |
radiate the Spirit of Christ to*others. The |
student must have humility, modest humility, |
as the young college life of today is creating |
the religion of tomorrow. |

Stephens told his hearers that he likes |
Christ for His tendernessyin reaching down |
and pulling the blackest sinner out of hell. |
“I love Christ for His great influence,” said |
Stephens, “for He never comes in contact |
with any soul that He does not conquer. He is |

Five Men Initiated
by Reporters’ Club

|

|
|

The following men, recently selected from |
the Sophomore class for membership into the |
“Reporters’ Club,” received their final initia-
tion on last Wednesday night: W. K. Prit=j
chet, J. P. McBryde, R. C. Grady, J. R. |
Graham and W. H. Bailey. . |

The five initiates were required to wear |
the regular newspaper caps for the last three |
days of the week. The caps were made. from |
a copy of “The Davidsonian” and have as a
chin band two cuts of ribbon displaying the
Reporters’ Club colors of blue and black.

At the picture show on Saturday the re-
er eae a very novel shine which
consisted of a baby contest. Two played the
role of babies, two others as mothers, and
the fifth served as judge, the gym being used
as a setting.

Last Wednesday night the regular initia-
tion took place, and each man, after produc-

was declared a full-fledged member of the

this because he wants his wife to have just
as much education as he has himself.

Recently he has become interested in Peace
Institute, of Raleigh, which he says is one
of the finest schools he has ever known, al-
though it is only a junior college. The
women who are Peace graduates are the
leaders in the circles of women with which
he has come in contact since he came to this
state, he says.

absence of team effort was not enough

for the Mongrams to win.

Bill Yates, though not a high scorer,
played the best game for the Monograms,
while Newcombe was high point man,
scoring a total of fifteen points. His
goals were almost all of a spectacular
variety. Wilson covered him closer dur-
ing the last half and did not give him
time to get placed as was the case during
the first half.

Tom Anderson was outstanding man
for Davidson, though McAuley showed

the essence of love, of tenderness, of square-
ness, changing the inner spirit into a beauti-
ful life of service. The men that Christ
converted were men that had failed, but later
became Christian martyrs.

beautiful story of Christ amd the woman
