Four wives’ lives

By AMANDA HALL
Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidsonian chose four ladies
at random to highlight faculty wives,
a part of Davidson students often
overlook. They enrich the community
for both the students and the resi-
dents (by contributing their talents
and service).

The ladies become members of the
Distaff Club, a service and social club
which is responsible for the social
functions of the college, when they
come to Davidson. ‘Without it you
wouldn’t have the nicer things,” said
Laura Grosch.

Service is not obligatory; new-
comers automatically serve on some
committee, but if time and other
obligations interfere a member may
leave the club. “‘I don’t think it’s ever
a burden--I’ve never felt it to be a
burden,’’ said Adelaide ‘“‘Babs’’ Mc
Kelway.

Faculty wives work with all aspects
of community life, from teaching
music to writing to founding the Day
Care Center. Several ladies teach in
« public schools or at Davidson.

‘‘What you find (in Davidson) is
that the wives are very well educated
and talented; they’re just a power-
house,’’ said Grosch.

Betty Cumming, wife of W. P.
Cumming, Professor Emeritus, has

been in Davidson since 1931, making
her one of the oldest residents. She
received her B.A. in English from
Smith College and her Masters from
Oxford.

The faculty wasn’t open to women
when Mrs. Cumming came to David-
son, so she taught English at Queens
College, specializing in American
Literature. In 1964 she became one of
the first lady teachers at Davidson,
teaching American Literature in the
summer session.

The Cummings received Fulbright
appointments to teach in Annamalai
University in India, where they were
often the only westerners in the
community. Mrs. Cumming’s job was
to help the freshmen speak and
understand spoken English.

The school was taught completely
in English because the administration
refused to use Hindi, which the
Indian government was trying to
make the national language.

“This was a very difficult assign-
ment because I hadn’t had any
training in that aspect of English
teaching,’’ said Mrs. Cumming.

She taught at a Japanese Christian
college for three months after leaving
India.

Fiver since she has come to David-
son, Mrs. Cumming has been active
in community service, and was given
the Sullivan Award for community
service by the college a few years ago.

The Davidson Day Care Center in
Mrs. Cumming’s main interest. She
worked with the original planning of
the center and has served on the
board since 1970.

“I’ve always been very interested
in race relations in town. Also, I’ve
been concerned with the need for care
for children of working mothers.

“One reason it means so much to
me is that it is the best interracial
project here,’ she explained.

Mrs. Cumming continued, “The
staff, the board, and the children are
all interracial, and it’s a very natural
relationship.”’

Mrs. Cumming has always been

involved with church work and has
taught Sunday school and worked on
the service committee for the David- ~
son College Presbyterian Church. The
church elected her an elder this year.

Much of her time is taken working
as her husband’s first research assist-
ant, writing books on early American
maps and history. ‘‘This has been
practically a full time job because I do
much research and some writing. I
almost never get on the title pages
because I’m not qualified, but I do get
a really nice acknowledgement in each
preface,”’ she said.

The Cummings’ latest book is The
Fate of a Nation, a bicentennial book
written with Hugh Rankin. By the
end of February they expect to have
an exhibit on the making of the book
in the E.H. Little Library.

Laura Grosch, wife of Herb Jack-
son, considered herself an artist when
she was six, and began supporting
herself with portraits in college. Her
art is her business and major source of
income now and she has lithographs

and paintings in gelleries across the
eastern U.S.

She received the Purchase Award,

special to him and the museum.
purchases it for their permanent
collection, from several shows, inclu-
ding the 10th Annual Piedmont
Graphics Exhibition at the Mint
Museum of Art in Charlotte and the
Western Annual Juried Exhibition of
Works of Art on Paper at Western
Illinois University.

Grosch received her B.A. in art
history from Wellesley College and
her B.F.A. in painting from the
University of Pennsylvania.

Grosch paints and draws in David-

Mrs. Betty Cumming

son during the winter but works
slowly, finishing only five or six
paintings a year. The drawings are
used as the basis for her prints done in
Boston in the summer.

‘Prints have given me mobility
because I can stay here and ship my
work all over the nation or the world,”’

-Vance Polley

she said.

She works with woven imagery in
ground. Grosch concentrates on mak-
ing a visual statement about how one
object of shape relates to another
using natural forms but emphasizing
abstract qualities.

‘I’m making a visual statement

and trough my work I keep develop-.

ing my ideas,’’ she said.
Compared to her paintings which
contain hundreds of colors, her prints

’ are much more subtle, with only three

of four colors. _

Grosch taught Davidson Commun-
ity art classes for five years, with
students from grades 1-12. During
the time she was teaching the classes

grew from about 12 to 70 students.
““T love to teach, but I found the
organization of classes and the hass-
les surrounding them took too much
time. I felt I was at the point in my
career when I just needed to be an

_artist,’’ Grosch said.

“One of the reasons I did teach was
the idea that people should have a
job. It’s hard for one to say, ‘I'm an
artist.’ and do just that. That’s your
job,”’ she said.

Grosch spends a large portion of
each week in business—entering com-
petitive shows and communicating
with galleries. She runs six miles a
day to release sorne of the tension
from drawing all day.

“As a woman growing up I didnt
feel discriminated against except in
sports. I wasn’t able to do the sports I
wanted so now I’m really into them. I
run about thirty miles a week and
swim about two miles,” she said.

Grosch works very closely with her
husband on the Davidson National.
“It takes a good solid three weeks of
my life running the National. And
that is like 12 hours a day,” she said.

For the past four years she has been
the Chairperson of the Art Openings
for Freshmen and spends a lot of time
working with art majors.

Grosch is an avid gardener, grow-
ing most of what she paints.

She is glad Davidson has gone
coed. ‘‘For me as a human being I felt
very isolated when I first came until I
realized that I could conduct my work
here. Coeducation at Davidson has
made my life better because it makes
me less conspicuous. It indirectly
benefitted me because it made me feel
more at ease,’’ she said.

Elaine Richey teaches violin for the
North Carolina School of the Arts
and privately in Davidson. She
performs with the Piedmont Sym-
phony Orchestra. consisting of the
faculty of the School of the Arts.

“I began violin when I was four.”
said Richey. *‘I'm from a musical
family so it was expected. I think the
family plan was for my brother to be a
violinist, my sister a pianist. and me a
cellist."

Richey was trained as a performer
by various teachers in Pittsburg. Pa.
and attended the Overland Conserva-
tory. She studied under Ivan Gala-
mian, the top violin teacher in the
world, at the Curtis Institute of
Music, and was made his apprentice
and assistant.

“That's where I got my tremendeus
boost into the teaching of vielin.”” she
said. “His teaching was for my
benefit.”

She was the Concert Master. the
