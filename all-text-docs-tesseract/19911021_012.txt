By Josh Larned

With the release of Blood Sugar
Sex Magik, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers have proven themselves
lords of the alternative funk/metal
scene. Produced by mastermind
Rick Rubin (of Public Enemy fame)
and recorded in a dilapidated L.A.
mansion, the album is an anthol-
ogy of intense songs and rhythmic
beats that will keep the listener

grooving to the end.
Fleacontinues to pluck the bass
with precision, while drummer
Chad Smith and guitarist John
Fruciante bring together the band
with their talented play. Capped
off with Anthony Keidis’ explo-

subjected to on top 40 radio. For
example, “Breaking The Girl”
proves Keidis’ vocal talent and
may well be the big hit of the
album.

In fact, I don’t mean to sound
trite, but this record could be the
one that catapults the band into the
mainstream listeners’ ear. And with
seventeen songs on one LP by a
forever cool group of musicians,
who could refuse to tune in?
