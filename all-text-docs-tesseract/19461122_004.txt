DR. THOMAS
(Continued from Page 1)

In pointing that rationalization
is the first step in bending the will
of God to suit personal interests,
Dr. Thomas presented the three
steps in Eve's fall to sin at the in-
stigation of the serpent: doubt that
God had forbidden eating the fruit,
the fact that God would really pun-
ish her, the fact that the value of
knowledge of good and evil far out-
weighed the minor detail of violat-
ing God’s commandment.

awarded -to five men in a formal
ceremony today (i. e. Brothers
Hatch, Powell, B. McGehee and
Pledges Cloaninger and V. Mc-

the dance Sat. night. “Mmmm”

the dates.
KAPPA ALPHA
With the winter days growing
shorter, and the weeks apparently
longer, the K. A. men are beginning
to appreciate week ends more than
ever.
Personal reports of a “fine
dance” could be heard from certain
sleepy-eyed individuals at Sunday
dinner. Among those _ singing
praises of the Queens Formal were
Brothers Hardin and Harris, and
Pledges King and Byrd.
Others headed north for the Twin
City With Salem College as their
destination. Brothers Ed Manget
and-Clayton Scofield, and Pledge
Charlie Mitchell were looking tired
but happy Sunday evening.
On up to Virginia went Brother
Art Lindsay. Rumor says he was
last seen taking snapshots at Ran-
dolph Macon.
