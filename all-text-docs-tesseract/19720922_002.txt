Bad Timing, Planning Bring
Only 57 Coeds To Campus

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

Coeducation has finally come
to Davidson with the in-
troduction of 57 women to the
campus, but only 29 of these
coeds are degree candidates.
The other women come to
Davidson through the Eight
College Exchange Program,
and they will attend Davidson
only for one year.

The number of women on
campus this fall is far less than
the 100 coeds called for in the
coeducation plan adopted by the
Board of Trustees last May, and
dissatisfaction has been voiced
at this development.

Starting this summer with let-
ters and discussions with the
administration, SGA President
Ralph A. Peeples expressed his
dissatisfaction with theslow way

Miss Mariam Nolen, a new
face in the admissions office, is
an assistant director of ad-
missions. She is the first
woman to hold this post at
Davidson.

The new head of the in-
tramural sports program here
at Davidson will be Raymond
H. ‘‘Chip"’ Stone Jr. He recen-
tly received his doctorate in
physical education from UNC-
Chapel Hill.

While an undergraduate at
UNC, Stone earned varsity let-
ters in football, baseball, and
soccer. Stone will not be direc-
tly involved in coaching any
varsity sport.

in which Davidson’ went
coeducational.

He says one of the main
reasons so few women are at
Davidson as transfer students is
because of a ‘no raid”
agreement made with the
women’s colleges in the Eight
College Exchange Program.
This agreement made in May
with Mary Baldwin, Randolph-
Macon Woman's, Sweet Briar,
and Hollins stipulated that
Davidson would not accept as
transfer students any women
attending these colleges

According to the regulations
of the Eight College Exchange
Program, Davidson could not
have accepted those women
who had signed up to come to
Davidson as exchange students
for one year, but the regulations
said nothing about women at-
tending these colleges who were
not on the exchange program.
Davidson on its own initiative
established this ‘‘gentleman’s
agreement."

Peeples said the _ four
women's colleges in Virginia
would have been the best source
of transfer students for this fall
because they attract the types
of students who would be at-
tracted to Davidson. He
claimed, ‘‘This explains why we
have 55 and not 75 women this
year. The eight college ex-
change has really screwed up
coeducation."’

In a letter to College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. he has called for Davidson's
immediate withdrawal from the
Eight College Exchange
Program.

“Tam disappointed we didn't
reach our 100 women projec-
tion,’ said Associate Professor
of History W. Brown Patterson,
who headed Davidson's
coeducation committee.

‘However, it could have been

fewer. I hope the 57 women are
good students,'’ he added.

Referring to the “no raid”
agreement, Patterson said, ‘‘]
was surprised by the decision. |
thought the four women's
colleges in Virginia would have
been the most fruitful
recruiting ground. I suppose
these colleges were alarmed at
the prospect of losing students.
Perhaps we were trying to be
sensitive to their enrollment
situation.”’

On the other hand, Director of
Admissions H. Edmunds White
said the primary reason David-
son attracted so few women was
because the Trustees did not
agree to coeducation until May,
a time by which most students
had made their plans for the
coming academic year.

White said the 28 transfer
women, in addition to the one
freshman woman who is the
niece of the new head of the
Spanish department, are from
almost the same geographical
areas as this year's freshman
class, which means all but six
are from the South.

The transfers are from 20

colleges, some being from such
unlikely places as Wooster,
Sarah Lawrence, Duke, Emory,
and Antioch, but others were

from such expected places as
Queens, UNC at Charlotte, and
the University of Georgia.

This year the largest number
of exchange coeds from an ins-
titution is the 15 from Mary
Baldwin. In addition, there are
Randolph-Macon Woman's, two
from Sweet Briar, four from
Hollins, three from Queens one
from Stratford, and one from
Stephens.

Not many women transfer
students applied early, and con-

Twins Illustrate Davidson Way

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

Strangely enough, or perhaps
unstrangely enough, Davidson
people seem to have the most
unbelievably intricate family
and friendship connections with
everyone else in the com-
munity.

This pattern, which is nearly
a tradition within greater
Davidson, has shown itself
again with the arrival of Loyce

Chany, who is now the
secretary of the college
president.

This in itself is hardly

unusual, but true to Davidson
form, Loyce is also the twin
sister of Joyce Flegal, currently
the Assistant to the Comp-
troller.

Both Loyce and Joyce, or
maybe Joyce and Loyce, first
arrived in Davidson in 1950 af-
ter graduating from the King
Business School in Charlotte. At
that time Joyce assumed a
position in the business office
and Loyce became the
secretary of the assistant to the
president, Samuel R. Spencer
Jr.

Naturally, both © sisters
married Davidson graduates
and from that point, split paths.

Loyce’ Sherrill married
Preston Chany, a career army
officer, and left) Davidson in

1953 for Fort Jackson. During a
two year stay at the fort, Loyce
served as the secretary of the
president of the Commercial
Bank and Trust Company of
Columbia, South Carolina,
Samuel R. Spencer Sr.

From Fort Jackson, Loyce
moved with her husband to
various bases in Europe, spen-
ding one year in Berlin where
she served as an Air Force In-
telligence secretary.

Back in Washington in 1960,
Loyce served as a_ legal
secretary in the Pentagon until
Sept. 1, 1972, and at one point
worked under General Earl
Cole, who has recently been in-
dicted and demoted on graft
charges involving American

=.

JOYCE

munitions in Viet Nam.
Joyce Sherrill married Fred
Flegal. a grandson of former

Davidson Spanish Professor
Fred Flegal, and left with her
husband, a public health of-
ficial, in 1962 for Birmingham,
Ala., and later Greensboro, N.
C.

Returning in 1964, Jofce
assumed the position of
assistant to the treasurer and
since the arrival of C. David
Cornell in 1971, is assistant to
the comptroller.

Both sisters live in the David-
son area, Joyce in Davidson it-
self and Loyce in Mooresville.

How purely Davidson.
