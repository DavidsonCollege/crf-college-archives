JUNIORS GET PALE
. AROUND THE GILLS

All Juniors alike are aware of the fact
that their time is drawing nigh. Only
two or three more days before the re-
sults of their labors for the past few
weeks will be exposed to the public. ‘Phe
question with which the Junior greets
his fellow. classmate as he meets him on
the campus is: “Do you know. your
speech?" The usual answer is: “I
think so.” Whether the Junior knows
his speech or not will be revealed when
the inevitable hour arrives. Like pulling
a tooth, in just ane short period it wil!
all be over. So cheer up, Juniors, the
worst is’ yet to come! Just remember
that you are not the only one enduring
misery while you are speaking!

Despite the fact that the majority of
the speakers will deal with the moment-
ous questions relating to the warld con-
flict, the visitors will hear varied topics
discussed which should be very interést-
ing.

SUNDAY RECORDS.

The total attendance on the Y. M. C.
A. Bible classes last Sunday was fair,
though it was a little less than it was
the week before. Rumple led in attend-
ance with 28, nine less than before.
Georgia ranked next with an increase of
five, making an attendance of 22. South
Chambers has dropped from .25 to 21.
Wiitts has lost two, leaving 18. And
North Chambers has ‘risen from 1 to
17. The total is 107.

Georgia and North Chambers have
the right idea. ‘Mheir attendance is on
the increase! Get up and go to a Bible
class—you can't sleep much after 9
o'clock, anyway. Don't: “kill time” on
Sunday morning. When you “kill time”
you kill part of your life. Make your
time count!

In spite of the rain the attendance on
the Sunday Schools was very encourag-
ing. The total attendance was: Schol-
ars, 233; teachers, 29.
