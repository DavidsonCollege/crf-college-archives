Pleads
Guilty

By GEORGE KANEKLIDES
A junior has pleaded. guil-

ty on a charge of stealing

from the Student Store.

The Honor Court has sen

tenced him to suspension
for the remainder ‘of the
spring term, but according

fo Ken Crews, chairman of
the Honor-Court, he will be
“acceptable. for readmis
sion in the ‘fall of 1970."
Crews said the decision is
consistent with the clause in
the Code of Responsibility
which “states that any stu:
dents found guilty of an
Honor violation will normal-
ly be. suspended for two
years. According to Crews,
the wording suggests that a

shorter suspension is per-
missible, ‘i
In 1962, however the fac-

“ulty set a precedent by rul-
ing that no sentence shall
be imposed for less than
two years. Crews expressed
hope that the faculty would
clarify or overturn this pre-
preiovus stand in the next
meeting of the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee.

Crews would not release
further information concern
ing the case, but stated that

transcripts of the trial are

available on request from the
office of the Dean of Stu
dents.
