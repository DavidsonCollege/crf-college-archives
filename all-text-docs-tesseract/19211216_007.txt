to fail to do.

Chemical—you’re right in some points,
but wrong in others. We admire you
for your frankness, we condemn you for
your narrow view, your destructive rath-

of all for your lack of true sportsman-

To the Editor of The Davidsonian:

When ‘I first read in a New York
paper of the burning of Chambers build-
ing, I was stunned. I felt, as many
Davidson alumni felt, that the heart of
the old campus had been burned out.
Chambers was more than a great, im-
posing edifice; she was a symbol of the
noble traditions, memories, achieve-
ments, ideals and hopes of Davidson.
To lose her is to lose a friend no amount
of money can restore.

Upon second thought, I felt sure that
Davidson would meet this disaster with
characteristic indomitable spirit. Fire
cannot destroy the soul of a great man
or the soul of a great college. Today
has come the issue of the Davidsonian
telling of the superb spirit in which stu-
dents and faculty met the situation. Your
courage and faith is thrilling and I
know that Davidson men everywhere
are united with you in a deeper loyalty
than ever to the college and in the de-
termination to build a greater and bet-
ter Davidson. You can count on the
men of 1915, (and alumni of other years
will say the same thing), to do all in our
power ‘to help.

When I told a certain Southern friend
here at Yale about the fire and about
the student assembly while the fire was
yet burning to begin planning fSr a new
Chambers, he said, “That’s Davidson!
You would expect nothing else from
ete

the college which deserves our qenei|
loyalty and devotion.

Woodrow Wilson, during his term as
president of Princeton Uniyirsity, was |
responsible for many improvements in|
the equipment and organization of the}
school, but probably his greatest work, |
and the one which has made the most |
lasting impression on the environment
and life of the students, was the man-;
ner in which he broke down the aristo- |
cratic spirit which dominated the Prince- |
ton campus. |

When. Wilson was called to office as|
president of Princeton he found it truly |
a “rich man’s college” and he set him- |
self to change this unfortunate condi- |
tion and to destroy the barriers which
surrounded the wealthy cliques, so she
a poor man might be able to meet his)
classmates on an equal footing. It was!
said in those days that if a fellow was |
not in the best of financial condition it}
was far better for him to go elsewhere |
to school. The stiff fight that Wilson}
put up against such a spirit in college is
one of the finest things in his entire
career and is one which will stand for-|
ever in the minds of all Princeton alumni.

Today, according to statistics gathered
by Secretary V. Lansing Collins, 27 per
cent of the Freshman class are working
part or all of their way through college
and an almost equal number of the new-
comers are being aided materially by
the university itself. Krom these few
facts it may be easily seen that Wilson
wrought a fundamental change in the
fife on the Princeton campus and one

The way you are carrying on through
such difficulties and planning bravely for
the future will inspire all Davidson
graduates. We will respond to your
confidence in us and will rally to rebuild,
Chambers, a New Chambers which shall
continue the finest traditions of the past

which many may be truly thankful for.

A striking analogy may be drawn be-
tween Princeton, as it is today, and Da-|

ONE BRAND-
ONE QUALITYy-

-

ne Size Package

All our skill, facilities, and lifelong knowledge of the
finest tobaccos are concentrated on this one cigarette—
CAMEL.

Into this ONE BRAND, we put the utmost quality.
Nothing is too good for Camels. They are as good as it’s
possible to make a cigarette.

Camel QUALITY is always maintained at the same high,
exclusive standard. You can always depend on the same
mellow-mild refreshing smoothness—the taste and rich
flavor of choicest tobaccos—and entire freedom from
cigaretty aftertaste.

And remember this! Caméls come in one size package
only—20 cigarettes—just the right size to make the greatest
saving in production and packing. This saving goes
straight into Camel Quality. That’s one reason why you
can get Camel Quality at so moderate a price.

Here’s another. We put no useless
frills on the Camel package. No ‘‘extra
wrappers!”’ Nothing just for show!

Such things do not improve the smoke
any more than premiumsorcoupons. And
their added cost must go onto the pricé
or come out of the quality.

One thing, and only one, is responsible
for Camels great and growing aaa
