Rude Notes and Random Scribblings

End of the Year--Finally

Shoot(this is not the word
originally used by Mr. Frampton
but you probably guessed thatany-
ways).

We’ve come to the mountain.
The end o’ the year has finally
fallen down upon us with a crash.
We all have finals, except for the
lucky wenis pinkles who major in

things like art history or acting |

and never have to do anything
except artize. Of course, most of
you rabble rousers probably won’t
start studying for your exams until
three the morning before and thus
incur the infamous D. But who
cares about that? Let’s talk about
some things that really matter, .
(In order to be circular, Eng-
lish major types like that, I am
returning to the pseudo-outline

format of past. By doing this, I,

also, hope to avoid the treacorous
venture into reason that befell me
lastissue:)

--Thé campus looks beauti- |

ful: Each morning as I walk to
class (well, every other morning),
I find myself gazing lovingly at
the soft white dogwoods and feel-
ing a desire growing within me to
just. .. puke. I want out of this
place! irs
--COLLEGE!
“*=-How about some com-
plaints? Well I’d talk about the
_SAE or the Alcohol policy but
each point seems sort of moot.
--I want to understand the at-
tacks on Fraternities on this cam-
pus. (I know it shouldn’t be a

capitalized word, but:I feel like™

the whole court needs alittle con-
fidence boost, and there’s is noth-
ing better for the self than being
put on-a pedastal.) The faculty
seems to be criticizing Fraterni-
ties as a tight group of young men
who are friends and get together
to enjoy each other’s company.
They eat together and they, God
forbid, choose who they want to
eat with them. I just want to be
loved, is that so wrong?

~ J want to know how the fac-»

ulty lounge works? Do the teach-

ers run around in a completely
random path, talking briefly to
whoever they physically run into
and then moving on? Can you
imagine the pandomonium? No,

Chris

Frampton»

no. They organize themselves into
neat little departments titled after
the particular field of studies in
which they havechosen to wander.
And, gasp, they search through the
huge numbers of prospects to enter
their select group.

Then after they invite them,
they put them through a rigorous

_ “visiting professor” test that really

seems unfair both to the prospect
and the students who have to take
their classes. (The teachers feel a
real need to prove they can’ be
tough on us.) Anyway, I digress.
(Math majors pay attention. Meta-

phor: a story in which people, ~

things, and happenings have a
hidden or symbolic meaning: alle-
gories are used for teaching or
explaining ideas, moral principles,
etc.)

--BEVERLY HILLS 902101S
STILL ON, People are watching
that immature, materialistic, unre-
alistic, lame program instead of
the mature and hysterically rele-
vant Cheers and Wings.

--Has anyone tried to ‘figure
out what this “[Schedule] in the
Sky with Diamonds” thing is? All
I know is that they go to the effort
to put the word “schedule” in brack-
ets but don’t cite their source. Of
course, Tesla wrote that beautiful
song and they deserve the credit. I
think [’ll bring Sue Ross up on
Honor Code charges.

--Speaking of Honor Code
charges. I want to ask anyone if
they remember Freshman year. Of
course, most of us were too drunk
to remember any of it, but, per-
haps, you were still sober during
Orientation. Think real hard.
(Maybe, a friend can hypnotize
you.) Does the phrase, “Freedom
and Responsibility,” ring a bell. I
think it does and I also think that
word group sums up the meaning
of the preamble to the Code of
Responsibility.

“An elaborate system of rules
strictly enforced might promote a
surfaceconformity to the standards
of behavior desired, but would not
effectively serve to develop the
maturity of character which is the
main aim of the college (Italics
mine). Rather, responsible matur-
ity is more likely to develop when
a member of the college commu-
nity is both free and obligated to
wrestle with principle of conduct
and to accept full (Underline not
mine) responsiblilty for his own
actions and decisions.”

I think I’m going to bring the

“administration up on charges of

violating the Code of Responsi-
bilty. (Hey, that’s a direct: quote
from the preamble, that supposed,
all-governing work.) In all seri-
ousness, though, the new alcohol
policy does seem to be incomplete
violation of the Code of Responsi-
bility. I hope, as does the student

body in general, that the trustees

remembered this when they voted
on April 25 and 26.

end of the year and the fact that

Remembering the one and only C. SHAW SMITH, who entertained
the troops in China in World War II and once upon a
stage China’s magician Long Tak Sam

It’s as yesterday.

When you get'there, look for oldtimers, you say,

who saw Long Tak Sam’s act with the goldfish bowl.

Some remember.

Then you opened the silk curtains and showed me,

I’ve watched his mastery in the theater of the mind ever since.
That was fall of 88 standing at the north end of Chambers Building
where as a student you ‘d played basketball in a vanished gym,
before we blew away to China.

Long Tak Sam--poised there raises empty hands
to the hush, steps, flings into a body

flip through the air to land

as astonished as we,

hands as full of something he found

somewhere between the taking off and the landing
as the goldfish bow] of fishes and water

couching which he lands on light fect and offers.

The fish jumped in the new bowl he held
as if they had just been birthed by sunlight.
Though we met no oldtimers who recalled,
I’ve checked the encyclopedia.

It was a very famous goldfish bowl

even in a land where acrobats fly.

Sounds fishy? Open your eyes. You blind nay sayers

are as raucous as the gibbons in the San Francisco Zoo,

our favorites. Jump in the swim of things.

Know your element. The laws he fooled over our eyes

were but the shadows of good things to come.

A great door was opened for us.

Out of empty hands into open eyes emerge

ombres chinoises like the white shadows of Glendower’s Wales.

Big Daddy, it was. a magit mountain

and you did it with silk.

If there’s a dark elegy up this sleeve,

musing hasn’t found it.

With a twinkling of an eye, concentration, and Carl Sandburg’s spit
you made us see

but not everything.
