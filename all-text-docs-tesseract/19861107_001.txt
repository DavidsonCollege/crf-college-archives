College should benefit from. tax-exempt bonds

By NELLE McCORKLE

Davidson and other North
Carolina private colleges can now
issue tax-exempt bonds, follow-
ing passage of a state constitu-
tional amendment Tuesday.

The amendment permits non-
profit private colleges and univer-
sities to finance construction and
renovation through sale of tax-
exempt bonds; North Carolina
public colleges and private hospi-
tals already can issue such bonds.

Direct benefits to Davidson
from the amendment’s passage in-
clude possibility of financing pro-
posed facilities improvements
through sale of tax-exempt bonds.

Comptroller Robert Davidson

- said, “It (the amendment) gives us
another option for financing capi-
tal funds projects — bricks and
mortar. Basically it’s for build-

Davidson may fund by sale of tax-
exempt bonds include erection of
a new sports complex and expan-
sion of existing arts facilities,
Davidson said.

Vice President for Business
and finance Robert S. Sutton said,
“We will evaluate this (opportu-
nity to issue tax-free bonds) as to
its advisibility for Davidson in
connection with construction of
the new sports complex, in con-
nection with any major dormitory
renovation, or similar projects.”

Sutton also cited possible gym--

nasium renovation.

When proposed in 1982, the
amendment did not pass in North
Carolina. “It was probably de-
feated in a backlash against any-

Julius Melton said.

North Carolina now provides
the same opportunity for private
colleges to sell tax-exempt bonds
already available in approxi-
mately 20 states, including South
Carolina and Virginia. Statewide,
over 25,000 in-state and 25,000
out-of-state students attend pri-
vate colleges.

Administrators spoke of the
flexibility the new amendment
provides. “We're very excited
about it,” Davidson said. “We
may or may not use it, but it gives
us an alternative when planning
for expansion as far as physical fa-
cilities go.”

Melton said, “It might not
mean anything for Davidson in a

Martin cited the drug problem
as one of our most urgent con-
cerns. “What do we do about drug
enforcement and drug education?
I’m not considering mandatory
urine testing, but we do have a
problem,” he said.

“It’s not going to go away. We
need to develop programs toiden-
tify people with problems — not
to remove them from society but
to help them,” Martin said. “I be-
lieve American colleges need to
take the lead in helping with this
problem.” He then challenged
Davidson to tackle this problem.
and be the forerunner in finding its
solution.

He said, “I hope Davidson
College will take that lead, find
those answers, share them with
society .. . If you do that, you
will be heroes.”

Martin also stated his support
for a bill that would grant the gov-
ernor of North Carolina the right
to veto, a privilege all other gover-

nors of this country possess. As
for being governor instead of a
member of the House of Repre-
sentatives; Martin said, “It’s not

being chief executive of our

practical sense. It would mean
borrowing money for construction
and other projects in the same way
that such other agencies as public
universities, water districts, and
hospitals can do.”

+ Sutton said, “I’ve had experi-
énce with numerous bond issues,
both for our corporate and for our
hospital clients. I know my hospi-

tal clients back:in Norfolk found it °

very beneficial to obtain interest at
the lowerst rate possible, the re-
sult being that it tended to keep
room rates and hospital changes
down.”

The college encouraged the
amendment’s passage by partici-
pation in the North Carolina. As-

Following Martin’s address,
Kuykendall conferred him with
the honorary degree, Doctor of
Laws. Kuykendall said, “Because
you bear the power of office with
conscience and serious purpose
and unaffected good humor; be-

“cause you excel in realms as di-

verse as science, music and poli-
tics; and because, after twenty
years in public office, you can be
accused of still having ‘a tendency
to be the college profes-
sor,’ ... Because, above ll,
you would agree with Hegel that
‘we should desire to have in the
state nothing except what is an ex-
pression of rationality,” Davidson
greets you as true gubernator —
helmsman, with a helmsman’s
gifts of foresight and judgment
and courage, and names you,
James Grubbs Martin, Doctor of
Laws.”

The final section of Convoca-
tion consisted of the presentation
of several student awards. The re-

cipients of this year’s Goodwin-
Exxon Awards which go annually
to a sophomore, a junior and a
senior “adjudged to exemplify the

Private college tax-exempt
bonds must be approved by the
state Higher Education Facilities
Finance Agency and by the Local
Government Commission. “I
think this requirement will insure
that we have good quality, credit-
worthy debt being issued and also_
that the bonds being issued won’t
‘interfere with tax-exempt financ-
ing being offered by local govern-
ments,” Sutton said.

Although these tax-exempt
bonds finance construction, funds
they generate may not be used to
erect churches or other buildings
used for religious purposes.
