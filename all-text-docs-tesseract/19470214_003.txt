Carolina’s White
Phantoms _ stopped
the Wildcats 55-46
Saturday night over
on the /Tar Heel
Gymn, but the
Carolina fans,
coach, and cagers
weren't breathing
any sighs of relief
until the final gun
sounded and there
was time for a long
look at the score
board, Led by Bob
Paxon, big forward
from _ Spokane,
Wash., the Phants
squashed a final Wildcat rally, and the Davidson cagers
were left holding the smaller end of the tally.

Jumping to a quick lead in the first half,
Ed White and George Peters dropped in a couple
of shots and the Cats led 4-0. Norm Kohler came
back for the Phants and with several well executed
shots caught up to the 7 point Davidson tally.
From there-on-out-it-was-Carolina with a-slight
lead until Pat Williams and Malcolm Earp sunk
fowls and sets to tie ‘the game at 14-14. Dillon
dropped in a fowl but Earp sank a long one to
give the Cats a 16-15 lead. Paxon and Kohler re-
taliated however with 2 field goals and a foul shot
and the half found the Cats trailing 20-16.

Back on the boards in the second half the Cat Cagers
fell behind and though whittling the Carolina lead down
to three points in the last 5 minutes of play. they lacked
the scoring punch. and were forced to settle for a 55-46

final count.
The Phants were hot and no one can deny

they have a first rate ball club. Paxon dropped
them in with ease all night and-Norm Kohler
played one of the best games in his repetoir. As
Ed White grinned after the game, “Those boys
just played good ball, that’s all.”

You don’t have to hang around Carolina long to
find out that All-American ‘Hook’ Dillon is the Caro
lina “Fair haired boy.” It seems that Dillon was a little
slow in starting this season and the fans were disappoint-
ed,, but his hook was good for 4 points and they’re still
proud of him.

CONGRATS

Mulling it over with some of the boys who
play the game, pound the boards during the week
and in short are the Red and Black Basketball
machine, I find it in order to write a few words of
praise for the fans and students. Though few in
number at the.recent South Carolina engagements
they made themselves heard and showed that
old spirit that Davidson is so proud of and if I
may act as medium between the fans and players,
they wish to extend words of thanks for fine
support,

Trailing 26-19 at the intermis-

second half with a new. defense to
top Al Adams, lanky Gamecock
center who pushed the register for
25 markers during -the evening.
White accounted for seven of his
eight buckets in the latter half,
missing only three of ten shots.

The White Flashes knotted the
count at 30-30 six minutes after
the second half opened. The little
co-captain took the lead with a one
hand push shot. From there the
lead see-sawed the remainder of the
game.

With less than a minute left,
Freshman Whit Cobb refused a foul
shot to take the ball out of bounds.
The strategy worked as the Dur-

things at 50-50. Jake Ashmore was
then good for the winning marker
on a push shot from the foul line.

dope on the South Carolina boys.
There is @ rumor around that the

as yet no definite personages can

be cited. Burman Riddle, who set

the conference on fire when he

12 points.
