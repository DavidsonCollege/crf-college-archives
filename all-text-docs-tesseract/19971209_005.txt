Watching Davidson’s impressive start
on its 89th basketball season has caused
many to conjure up the warm memories
of another time, a time some refer to as
the “Golden Age” of Davidson basket-
ball.

These were the Lefty Driesell years
and the time when a controversial coach
succeeded in transforming a weak team
of “preministerials into a strong team of
aspiring All-Americans.”

And one cannot forget the man-
power behind the movement, the play-
ers who carried basketball to this “sleepy
little town” on their shoulders. The
seasons of 1962-69 brought Davidson
what it had only dreamed of: Southern
Conference regular. season champion-
ships, Southern Conference tournament
titles, national rankings, NCAA Tour-
nament wins, spots in the Elite Eight,
and most importantly, the emergence of
Davidson basketball as a force to be
reckoned with.

In 1963, the Wildcats accom-
plished a 20-win season for the first
time,in school history. Under the direc-
tion of coach C. G. (‘Lefty’’) Driesell,
Davidson orchestrated a Cinderella sea-
son.

Finishing second in the Southern
Conference, the Wildcats posted an
overall record of 22-7. However, David-
son stumbled in the finals of the confer-
ence tournament, falling to West Vir-
ginia, and ending their hopes for an
invitation to the NCAA tournament.

Atthat time, many athletic confer-
ences, including the Atlantic Coast and
Southern, selected their representatives
to the NCAA solely by the postseason
tournament method, thus leaving out
many talented teams that. failed to win
the championship game.

The 1963-64 season was to be the
true test of Davidson’s competence.
Some fans had high expectations for the
Wildcats, while others dismissed the
previous season as a fluke — a
Cinderella story that had already been
closed and moved to the shelves. Nev-
ertheless, Driesell and “his boys” con-
tinued their march to the national
rankings.

The phenomenal Fred Hetzel, who
was boosted by one sports writer as the
“most outstanding Davidson athlete to
have put on a uniform in recent his-
tory,” led his teammates to an impres-
sive 22-4 record and a regular season
championship.

Fueled by momentum and armed
with the ‘patented zone press,” David-
son headed into the postseason with
high aspirations. But the league tour-
ney would again be the Wildcats’ nem-
esis, as they went home after a disap-
pointing one-point loss to VMI in the
second round. Still, the team had won
the support of the college community.

The March 6, 1964, issue of the
Davidsonian lauded the team, saying it
had “managed to do in one season some-
thing that all the Rhode’s Scholars,
Woodrow Wilsons, and Dean Rusks
could not really do in 125 years — put
Davidson on the map and in the minds
of millions of Americans.”

The Wildcats also infused the cam-
pus with basketball fever. Wrote
Davidsonian sports writer Bill Briggs:

“The ‘Cats were worshipped by a so-
phisticated campus which often would
seem to prefer purgatory or eternal dam-
nation than show open admiration for
anything.”

Players like Fred Hetzel, Terry
Holland, and Bill Jarmen had helped
transform Davidson basketball in the
early 1960s, and together laid the tracks
for a successful future. Hetzel paced
Davidson to its first national rankings
in the mid-60s, and personally achieved
All-American status, as well as a multi-
tude of other individual awards and
records,

In his senior season, 1964-65,

Hetzel again emerged as team leader.
Although ending their season with a
heart-breaking loss to West Virginia,
Davidson accomplished an unbeliev-
able 24-2 record and went undefeated
in Southern action. Hetzel’s remark-
able career at Davidson was over, but
his legacy would remain.
Davidson was steadily gaining recogni-
tion as a strong team with its first na-
tional rankings, but the team had still
fallen short of an invitation tothe NCAA.
All this would change in the 1965-1966
season.

Despite the loss of Hetzel, David-
son fans were extremely enthusiastic
abouf their beloved basketball team.
While national sports writers had writ-
ten the team off after Hetzel’s gradua-
tion, Davidson proved that it was more
than a one-man group.

A new team leader, “Superhorse”
Dick Snyder, steered the determined
team to reach its goals. Finally, the
Wildcats clinched both the regular sea-
son and tournament titles, as well as its
first ever bid to the NCAA tournament.
After beating Rhode Island in the first
round of the East division, Davidson
exited the tournament following two
losses to Syracuse and St. Jotin’s. While
the team and the fans were disappointed
with their poor performance in the sec-
ond and third games, all took comfort in
a promising season ahead in 1967.
But the season did not go as well as they
had hoped. The 1966-67 season was a
lull — an unspectacular season that
finally ended with a 15-12 record. Re-
uniting with an old foe in the confer-
ence tournament produced an old re-
sult, as Davidson fell to West Virginia.
Yet, the next two years saw the Wild-
cats take Davidson farther into
postseason play than they ever had be-
fore and ever have since. The Wildcats
found another star in Mike Maloy, a
future All-American.

Anunapologetic redemption in the
conference tournament and respective
records of 24-5 and 27-3 were all
complements to the Wildcat’s greater
achievements in the NCAA tournament.
In both seasons Davidson advanced to
the Elite Eight by winning the first and
second rounds.

However, it was North Carolina,
coached by a young Dean Smith, that
finished the Wildcats both years. Nev-
ertheless, in only a few short years,
Davidson had accomplished what many
large and small schools only dare to
dream. The Wildcats were ranked by
both the UPI and AP polls for six years,
eventually ascending to No. 3 accord-
ing to the UPI and No. 5 in the AP
rankings in 1969.

also received other offers to coach.
Driesell left Davidson for Maryland
after the 1969 season, much to the dis-
may of his ardent supporters. Driesell’s
departure during the height of the re-
cruiting season left the basketball pro-
gram in disarray as they frantically
searched for Driesell’s replacement.
Terry Holland, a former standout
player for and assistant to Lefty, was
selected and led the Wildcats to another
stellar season and NCAA appearance.
But Driesell remains a legend in David-
son. His fiery nature attracted fans to
his obvious coaching skill. Driesell and
his players “put Davidson on the bas-

ketball map.”” One Davidsonian ar-
ticle praised Driesell as “the man who
took an athletically poor little college
and built it into a basketball giant.”

“He had a dream,” said the au-
thor, “and the desire to go along with
it.” But, the Davidsonian was quick to
remind its readers that life with Lefty
was not always a bed of roses. Driesell
was a “character” whose strong per-
sonality also found him at odds with
Davidson’s administration. At one
point, the controversial coach was
called down by the college president
for his “aggressive, high-handed, and
disrespectful attitude.”

Driesell’s biggest problem,
though, was among his team. Al-
though respected, Driesell never did
gain affection from the majority of his
players. A fellow coach once com-
mented on the tense situation, saying
that while Driesell’s players com-
plained about him,. it was Dreisell
who was writing letters to find them
jobs.

“Here’s a coach working for his
boys,” said a former Boston Celtics
coach, “and they don’t appreciate it.”
In retrospect, Davidson fans are very
appreciative of Driesell and his leg-
endary teams. They offered “big-
time” basketball to this “sleepy little
town” and the thirst for the action has
yet to be quenched.

Nearly 30 years have passed since
this “Golden Age,” and the 89th bas-
ketball team may be the group to bring
it back.
