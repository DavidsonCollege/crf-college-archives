Drums, not guns

African dance and drum troupe gives rhythm to soul

By CHAD FOGLEMAN
Staff Writer

“You sound just like Afri-
cans!” Richard Campbell’s voice
boomed like the thunder of the
drums surrounding him. Wo hu te
sen? the big manasked, singing in
the Twi language of West Africa;
Me hu ye! we, a sparse but spirited
crowd, shouted in return. “How
are you doing?” “Very well, thank
you,”

Love Auditorium welcomed
the sounds and songs and stories of
Akwaaba Thursday night as part
of both the Cultural Artists Series
and the ongoing celebration of
Black History Month. Akwaaba,
which means “welcome” in Twi, is
an African dance and drum troupe
composed of students from Pied-
mont Courts, a low-income hous-
ing division in Charlotte. Directed
by Campbell under the auspices of
the Charlotte Housing Authority,
the group consists of some 23 per-
formers, eight of whom (ranging
in age from 12 to 20) played in
Love, danced gracefully in color-
ful robes and pounded out rhythms
on five different types of drums.
“Some of these kids are better than
me,” Campbell chuckled after the
show, “and my old muscles.”

Campbell, 42, and graduate of

UNCC, began drumming while on
mission trips to West Africa with .

the ICYE (International Christian
Youth Exchange). He heard the
beatings in the bush, then learned
to drum himself under the tutelage
of the African villagers in whose

community he was working. “I’ve
been to Africa three times, to ten
different countries,” he says
proudly.

But he is most proud of all the
kids participating in this Charlotte
Housing Authority program.
“Some of these kids were D and F
students. Now they’re A and B
students,” he beams.

The group drummed and
danced and sang a medley of tradi-
tional and original songs including
“Kumbahya,” a stirring “Funga
Alafia” and asong Campbell heard
working in the fields of Africa,

were even written by one of the
preformers, Melvin Steele, who
(appropriately) showcased his tal-
ent on the steel drums. Art Flagg,
who along with Debbie Liverman,
was instrumental in bringing
Akwaaba_ to Davidson, smiled:
“It’s uplifting, good for the spirit
and the soul.” He emphasized,
“We need to take part in more
things like this.”

“It’s better to put a drum in a
kid’s hand than a gun,” Campbell
remarked. Truly, the sound and
spirit of Akwaaba is audible proof
of that.

Peace of the past lies on Main St.

Anyone who has traveled to
Myrtle Beach from Charlotte has
bypassed Bennettsville, S.C.
Tucked away on Business 38, the
county seat of Marlboro County
provides a quiet spot of respite for
those seeking much-needed peace.
Of course, entertainment relies
heavily upon you; Bennettsville
has no theater, no golf course, and
no shopping malls.

On the Road

My purpose for visiting

Bennettsville was to stay in The
Breeden Inn & Carriage. House.
Located on Main St, this romantic
Southern mansion (c. 1886) pro-
vides a haven for antique lovers,
runners, and walkers. Wrap-
around porches, a huge backyard,
and flower gardens lend to the
house’s atmosphere.

The Innkeepers, Bonnie and
Wesley Park, exuded Southern
hospitality and charm, seeking to
accomodate my every need and
interest. Bonnie’s full, elegant
breakfasts were simply wonder-
ful, providing enérgy for the day
ahead.

Although the modern enter-
tainments can not be found, sev-

eral points of interest might hold
your eye (especially if you love
history). The County Courts are
heldin a beautiful building on Main
St. Jin-Jin, a local Chinese food
chain, sits across the street;

Nimmy’s, a wonderful bakery, lies °

just down the road.

Of particular interest is a res-
taurant serving Southern buffet.
During the Civil War, the owners
of the house heard of Sherman’s
march, and sought to protect their
property. They did so by disman-
tling the house, numbering the
boards, and hiding the dismem-
bered abode until the Union troops
had passed. The house was reas-
sembled where it now stands, and
is a true landmark.

There are several museums in
Bennettsville, each very limited in
size and scope, but providing in its
own fashion a piece of the South-
ern heritage. Most of the exhibits
pertain to the Native Americans
who resided in what is now
Marlboro County several centu-

ries ago.

But one remarkable building
houses a folk art stencil which the
archealogists and specialists from
Colonial Williamsburg wanted to
purchase ffor their site.
Bennettsville held out on selling
and now possess a beautifully re-
stored piece of colonial art.

If you feel the need to get out
and explore, there are hundreds of

‘country roads branching out in all

directions. Several lead to an auc-
tion house in Dillon, SC, which is
a wonderful find for antique lov-
ers. Other roads direct your course
to I-95, a major interstate provid-
ing easy access to Florence, SC,
and Rockingham, NC.

For those who love quiet,
Bennettsville provides a definite
place of rest. The Breeden Inn is
an affordable yet luxurious place
to stay; Bonnie and Wesley Park
only add to its charm. Although
modern entertainment amenities
are absent, the void is easily filled
with a look into the past.
