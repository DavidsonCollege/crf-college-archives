Freshman registration for
rush Wednesday night began
preparations for Rush Week
which will be held during the
first week of second semester.

This is the latest Rush Week
that has been held at Davidson
in several years, rush usually
being held sometime first se-
mester.

During the first night of
Rush Week, each freshman par-
ticipating in rush will visit six
fraternities, not seeing any fra-
ternity more than once. The last
two nights are reserved for re-
dates at specific fraternities.

The Interfraternity Council has
passed several rules which will
govern this year’s rushing activ-
ities.

Contact in. freshman dorms
and fraternity houses between
freshmen and upperclassmen
during examination and. rush
week was forbidden by the IFC
at its meeting Tuesday night..

between freshmen .and fraterni-
ty men,.”’ IFC President Mike

end of, rush at 5 p.m. Friday.

Booe commented. ‘It merely
states that such contact may not
occur in the dormitories or fra-
ternity houses.”

The IFC voted favorably on
Booe’s proposal to have repre-
sentatives from the fraternities
meet the rushees at the dormi
tories and take them to the
parties rather than have them
go alone.

Booe and IFC Representative
Ben Cannon introduced the
freshmen to the mechanics of
rush during freshman chapel
Monday.

The actual mechanics and
dates which will be used during
this year's rush program have
been released by the IFC.

The 12 fraternities will return
date cards with suggested dates
to the IFC by 6 p.m. tonight.
These cards will be available to
the freshmen from 2-4 p.m. in
Hodson Hall on Sunday.

The freshmen will have until
Monday at 1 p.m. to return their
date cards in the brown enve-
lopes located in the College

Surveyed

Due to suggestions from the
Office of the Dean of Students,

- the Social Council is once again

seeking to provide additional
entertainment for Independents
on big weekends.

A questionnaire, asking Inde-
pendents what type of activities
they would like for the council
to sponsor after concerts on the
college's three major weekends
as well as for lesser weekend
concerts, has been issued.

The questionnaires are to be
collected Sunday. The council
will begin action on them soon
after then.

Three alternatives are sug-
gested on the questionnaire, in-
cluding open fraternity parties,
combo parties held on campus
and free movies. All three have
been held in the past with gen-
erally poor response.

The case was. the first rush,

The violation was in the form
of an off-campus social gather

according to unofficial sources.

Officials of the board refused
to release any information on
the violation. other than the fact
that a single fraternity had been
convicted.

A penalty was levied on the
fraternity, but the board would
not specify what it was.

“As chairman of the Judicial
Board I am not sure of the pre
cedent for publishing our de-
cisions."’ Johnny Jeter told THE
DAVIDSONIAN this morning.
“Therefore, we are withholding
announcement of, the penalties
involved until we notify the IFC

In other action, the board cori-

Class Of ’70 Evaluates
Second Semester Rush

It's rush time at Davidson,
and a lot of students are won.
dering what effect the new
rush system will have on the
fraternities.

This year, for the first time,
Rush Week is the first week of
second semester. In previous
years, Rush Week was during
the first week of school or
sometime during the first se-
mester.

The philosophy behind the
change was that the freshmen
would have the chance to he-
come a unified class. Waiting
a semester would let them get
settled at Davidson.

They would also have more
opportunities to get to know
upperclassmen. Thus. the
freshmen would be better pre-
pared to make a decision about
fraternities.

Are the freshmen any better
prepared? How well did the
informal rush during first se-
mester work? Several fresh-
men were interviewed this
week in an effort to determine
how the freshmen fee! about
rush,

There were several points of
agreement and some points of
disagreement which came out
during the interviews.

ler waiting period. gave them.
a chance to settle down and
find out a few things about
fraternities. However, some
said that there was a general
lack of information about the
fraternity system at Davidson.

The boys also felt that they
knew more freshmen than they
would have under the old sys-
tem. But there was disagree-
ment about how well the up
perclassmen had gotten to
know the freshmen.

One. group felt that upper
classmen had not done a very
thorough job of meeting the
freshmen. This same group
also said that.the fraternities
had not taken advantage of
the opportunities to meet
freshmen.

Not so. said the opposing
group. Upperclassmen have
done a great job of making
the freshmen feel at home.
Freshmen, they said. had to
put forth some effort, too.

One of the boys expressed it
like this: “A freshman can’t
sit in his room and expect the
upperclassmen to walk right
in. He has to go out and meet
them. Besides that, some of
the upperclassmen are just as
nervous about meeting fresh-
men as we are about meeting
them.”

In answer to the question,
‘How could the rush system
be improved?" few sugges-
tions were brought forth. How.
ever, one suggestion was that
the fraternities have some kind
of open house program so that
the freshmen would have a
chance to meet the fraternity
‘men sooner and also get to
see all 12 fraternities.

Others said that they would
like to be able to go to all the
fraternities during Rush Week.
instead of only six. There were
a few suggestions that Rush
Week be moved back to first
semester. The reason for this
was that the freshman’s so-
cial life would be improved
immensely,

It also questions “apparent

VOLUNTARY

Faculty Critique Set

Student Council members are
initiating the long-awaited facul-
ty evaluation project this week.
as cooperating professors will
distribute the evaluation forms
to their classes.

The program, which is entirely
voluntary, will consist of a two-
page questionnaire which stu-
dents will fill in and return to

their professors.

No one, other than the individ-
ual professor, will see the forms.

Ken Autrey, chairman of the
council's Academic Committee,
urged students to be fair and re-
sponsible in filling out the forms.

“This is an opportunity for the
student to provide an evaluation
which will be helpful to his pro-

fessor,’ Autrey said, ‘‘but it will
also be a chance for him to re-
think his attitude toward his
work."

The committee consulted pro-
grams used at other colleges
and _ universities. including
Southwestern. Michigan State,
Grinnel and UNC to formulate
their own form.
