BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (CPS) --
According to a recent study by
the Kinsey Institute for Sex Re-
search at Indiana University, stu-
dents these days are anything but
starved for sex.

Yep, the study shows -- stop
the presses! -- that most students
on college campuses are having
lots of sex these days.

A survey of 651 undergradu-
ate men and women showed that
81 percent of the men and 75 per-
cent of the women were not vir-
gins; that the average age for both
sexes’ first sexual experience was
17, and that students spend an
average of two nights a week with
their sexual partners.

The study shows that 50 per-
cent of the men and 36 percent of
the women had sex with someone -
they. just metand that, onaverage,
students had two one-night stands
in 1990.

Glosson

should be very clear about exactly
what the force wants to accom-
plish. President George Bush told
Glosson, Schwarzkopf and the rest
of the commanders of Desert
Shield/Storm that he wanted Iraq
out of Kuwait. He also wanted an
absolute minimum loss of life, the
majority of Iraqi weapons and all

of its nuclear and chemical war-)
fare capabilities destroyed and the

elimination of any further Iraqi
threat within the area.

Glosson said Bush’s last ob-
jective was only “half-met” and
that “Iraq is not going to be able to
do anything for quite a few years,
however, we can’t just lift our
sanctions or take our eye off them.
As long as Saddam is in Iraq, there
is still a problem.” He did add that
going into Baghdad and driving
Saddam out would have been a
mistake at the time because it was
evident that Iraq could have be-
come a “larger Lebanon.’

Glosson said the third factor
was perhaps the most important:
the need for political courage. He
said, “Our nation should take to

heart the importance of the amount
of political courage by President
Bush and the administration. Iam
truly grateful for the amount of
toughness, leadership, courage, and
confidenceshown by the President
throughout the conflict.”

Finally, Glosson said that a
nation cannot use force without
either the proper weapons or the
proper training. “We cannot dial
upcapabilities when acrisis arises,
and we cannot build up technology
overnight. So, I thank all of your
parents and taxpayers for all of
their tax dollars over the past fif-
teen years for making such weap-
ons as the B-117 Stealth Bomber
possible,” said Glosson.

Glosson also talked about the
very real possibility of a New
World Order. He believes that for
the first time the United Nations
worked together quickly and ef-
fectively. This efficiency resulted
because, he said, “Frankly, with
the ending of the Cold War, the
nations of the U.N. and its Security
Council just don’t have as much to
argue about anymore. Hopefully,
we can turn this one example into
the road map for the future.”

Glosson also said that the
amount of information given out
to the American people in any fu-

tureconflictcould greatly increase
as aresultof the Gulf War. He said
that because the deceptive use of
information given to the press
during the Vietnam War leftsucha
scar, the press in the Gulf wanted
to know too much, giving no room
for necessary censorship by the
military. Thus, the administration
was forced to place huge restric-
tions on the amountof information
given out, which led to the large
controversy over the people’s
“right to know.”

Glosson thinks that because of
these two situations both the press
and the administration have now
found some sort of median. Thus,
he said this can only benefit the
American public because now
more accurate information can be
announced without the fear of
compromising allied positions or
people.

Glosson went on to say that he
believes that if a reporter doesn’t
transmit any information that
would possibly endanger a life, he
would allow them to go anywhere,
see anything, and talk about what-
ever they would like to talk about.
He says, however, that his opinion
is in the minority at tis point in
time.

suggested that if there were aliens,
they should land in the black com-
munity because “we’re indiffer-
ent.”

Giovanni confronted the issue
of racism by saying that there is
still a lot of this in our nation. She,

was concemed about how people
were no longer happy with getting
what they want or satisfied with
doing the best that they can do.
Her talk also ranged to the
subject of death. Giovanni said
that if God ever made a joke, it’s
that nobody knows when they are
going todie. Sheremarked onhow

Giovanni also spoke on how
there will always be hope and that
we should explore the world and
take care of ourselves. She also
commented on how people must
function on things that give them
hope. She said, “As long as there
is hope, we will go forward.”
Giovanni also said, “I write be-
cause I believe that there is always
