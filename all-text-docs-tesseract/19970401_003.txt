THE DAVIDphONIAN

Apocalypse: soon, says
senior seer Seavers

By YANNOos TRADAMUS
Your wet dream

According to Davidson senior
Dennis Seavers, the end of the world
will occur on July 27, 1997 at ex-
actly 12:47 pm, EST.

“It’s true,” says Seavers. “The
world will come toa blinding end at
12:47. I’ve seen the signs of the
apocalypse as they’ve been pre-
sented in the Revelation of St. John,
and they’re coming true.

“Thaven’t figured out all of the
details yet, but I know a few. I’m
becoming a Catholic priest after
graduation, though, and I might be
able to study about the end times in
seminary for the two months be-
tween graduation and armageddon.”

Seavers says, “For example,
Revelation 12:1&2 reads, ‘A
woman clothed with the sun, with
the moon under her feet and acrown
of twelve stars on her head, was
pregnant and cried out in pain as she
was about to give birth.’”

He explains, “The woman is
clearly Madonna, which is ironic
because she shares her name with
the Virgin, who was and still is the
mother of God. Madonna, however,
isthe mother of the anti-christ, which
makes sense, because the Bible says
that the antichrist will resemble
Christ in many ways but will not be
Christ.

“I do love Madonna, and it’s a
shame that she gave birth to Satan’s
spawn. As much as Id like to be-
lieve that she isn’t the woman,
though, I just can’t help but believe
it. The sun that she’s clothed in is
music, and the moon under her feet
is Hollywood, which Madonna has
recently conquered with her fantas-
tic performance in Evita.”

Seavers is confident that his
interpretation ofthe Bible is accu-

rate, and he gives another example.
“The most interesting sign is the
Beast. The Bible says, ‘And he was
given authority over every tribe,
people, language, and nation. All
inhabitants of the earth will wor-
ship the beast.’”

Seavers explains, “Throughout
history, people have interpreted the
sign of the Beast in many different
ways. Unenlightened fundamental-
ists have claimed that the Pope,
Kennedy, and Martin Luther King,
Jr. were the Beast, but they’ve all
got it wrong.”

“The Beast is. not actually a
person, but acorporation. Since I’m
a philosophy major, I’ve dedicated
a lot of time to understanding the
meaning of life and contemporary
culture.

“Tt turns out that the Beast is
based in Milwaukee, and its corpo-
rate plan to prepare the world for
destruction includes mass distribu-
tion of its ‘light’ product.”

Seavers says, “I know it sounds
fishy, but 666 is the number of the
Beast, and everybody knows that
this is how many beers 55 college
students go through in a night, and
55 is, like 666, an unholy number.
Take-7, a holy number, square it,
and you get 49, a super-holy num-
ber. Now add 13, an evil number,
and you get 62, a defiled holy num-
ber. Then you take away 7, or the
remaining holiness, and you get 55,
a completely defiled number.”

Many scholars disagree with —

Seavers’s assessment of
armageddon. Freshman Eric
Ferguson says, “Okay, the biggest
problem I have with this interpreta-
tion is that it completely disregards
abortion. What the Bible is really
saying about the woman and the
Beast is this:“The woman clothed
in the sun with her feet on the moon

write for news, call matt.

is the women’s movement, and the
Beast is aborticide, the sick, evil
spawn of the women’s movement.
Any view of the endtimes must in-
clude the murder of millions upon
millions of innocent babies.”

Junior Bonner Scholar says,
“Well, you know, like, I read some-
where that the world is like ending
in 1999 and stuff, like in the Prince
song, you know? And so how can it
be like ending this year when it’s
two years too early and stuff? I
mean, all those really good maga-
zines in the grocery store, like the
ones without staples like the
Enquirer and that News magazine
and stuff, well they all say that the
guy who knows when the world is
ending is named Nostra-something,
not Dennis. Whatever.”

Seavers responds, “I agree that
the world will end in the year 1999.
The only problem is, back when
they calculated the calendar, mis-
takes were made. Biblical scholars
disagree about when exactly Christ
was born, but they all place the
event between 4 B.C.E. and 6 C.E.
I’ve done some calculations of my
own, and it appears that he was born
in 2 B.C.E., which means that it’s
actually 1999 now.”

Religion professor Bill
Mahony also disagrees with
Seavers. Mahony says, “Dude man,
when the end comes, it’s not going
to be a beast destroying the world in
a fiery flash. That’s a Western mis-
interpretation of the Bible, man. To
understand it, you’ ve got to look to
the East. Always look to the East.

“Man, when the end comes,
it'll be Shiva flying down ona magic
carpet woven from the world’s
greatest silk, changing the appear-
ance and essence of the earth and
making it new. She will be fear-
some and wonderful. Dig it.”

Wah.

Cosmic Coffee goes down the
drain: I’m not bitter, my coffee is.

By JAcop ABRAHAM
Cosmic Critic

After almosta year of not-busy-
ness, Cosmic Coffee has finally re-
tired its shingle. Surprisingly, stra-
tegic business moves like shorten-
ing business hours and raising prices
did nothing to draw customers.

“Once we received a bad re-
view in The Davidsonian, we never
could recover,” complained shop
owner Nancy Gray. “I would have
gotten away with it if it weren’t for
that pesky paper and their little In-
dian reporter too.”

The article complained that
Cosmic didn’t cater to smokers and
that the store’s chairs were too un-
comfortable. And that the wait-
resses didn’t flirt with the horny
truck drivers. You have to go to
FAC in the 900 Room for that sort
of thing.

“But I like the spikes in the
middle of the chairs. Form follows
function,” says Gray. :

“T agree completely,” says jun-
ior wannabe-SGA-member Eric
Sapp. “Itried to get the SGA to give

them ATC funds, but they wouldn’t
listen to me. If I were on SGA
things would be different. Cosmic
would still be in business and they
wouldn’t have to publish ads in that
liberal trash alterna-paper. That’s
the real problem. Good Christians
are frightened away from the store
when they see such evil propaganda
in the windows.” ;

“T think Jumpin’ Java ran them
out of town. It’s the Scrabble. Can’t
beat Scrabble,” says Jumpin’ Java
regular Margaret Lumpkin.

“Lumpy’s right,” says Profes-
sor Bob “Self-Annointed” Manning,
“Cosmic just plain sucked.”

Gray felt the student apathy,
and spent all the slow hours trying
to think of ways to attract them.
Unfortunately, such hot items as
“those little things that you sit on
that look like naked people that are
supposed to be chairs”* were not so
hot after all.

“T liked them,” says Buster
Burk.

‘Y'm not bitter,’ says Gray.
“T’m not bitter, I swear.”

Ha ha! I won!
