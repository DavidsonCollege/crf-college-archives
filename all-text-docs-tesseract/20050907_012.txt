OF THE WEEK

‘Wildcat Game of
the Week

Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Football vs. Greensboro

Though the football team’s season opener
did little to inspire confidence, this game
still merits much attention. Besides being
the home opener, the new stadium will be
dedicated, and the team should be anxious
to improve upon last week’s performance.

Davidson football has never graced. the
cover of Sports Illustrated, but if it did,
there’s a 37 percent chance that-it would
make the team even worse.

That’s the statistic that, since 1954, has
made some athletes strangely and strongly
averse to good press.

The front page of SI has been causing
problems for professional, amateur, and col-
lege athletes that extends beyond simple
chance.

Known as “the Cover Jinx,” some say it
has produced failures, deaths, divorces,
slumps, and may even be contagious when
contracted.

In 2002, an SI writer found that out of
2,456 covers, there were 937 cases of bad
luck within two weeks of the athlete or team
appearing.

Is this a silly superstition?

Maybe not.

Take for example skier Jill Kinmont, who
was featured on the front of Sports
Illustrated in the 1950s: during a practice
race, she struck a tree, was paralyzed from
the neck down, and thus became the second
victim of the jinx. ;

The first was hall of famer Eddie
Matthews, third baseman for the Atlanta
Braves in the early 1950s, who suffered a
hand injury which caused him to miss seven
games.

In the ’60s, Mexican driver Ricardo
Rodriquez died in a horrible, fiery crash after
he was touted by SI as “Mexico’s Young
Fireball.”

Ironic.

Pat O’Connor, race car driver and cover-
boy of 1958, was killed in a pileup in the first
lap of his next race.

More recent victims include Michael
Jordan, whose wife divorced him while his
cover story was going to press, the Redskins,
Anna Kournikova (not that she needs any
help), John McEnroe, Vinny Testaverde, and
Barry Bonds, who dropped 40 points from
his batting average in two weeks.

A Statistics expert was quoted to say that
the jinx is simply “regression to the mean,”
or put more plainly, that every really good
player can, and usually does, clutch at some
point in their careers, usually when people

Fantasy football, a nice

By Ricky DIMON

For many people, the new school year
means a return to the books, countless hours
in the classroom, and endless nights in Little
Library. For others, however, coming back to
school simply suggests one thing: another
glorious NFL season is on the horizon.

With kickoff just a week away, this is the
time of year when
fans of every NFL
team have good rea-
son to hope. Unlike
Major League
Baseball, where
watching the New
York Yankees and
Atlanta Braves play
deep into October is
virtually guaranteed,
and where finding the
Tampa Bay Devil
Rays wallowing at
the depths of the
standings is life’s
fourth certainty, the
NFL is laced with
parity.

Sure, I would glad-
ly wager most of my bank account on the
New England Patriots rolling to another AFC
East title, but other than that, nobody knows
what is going to happen.

In what other professional league can a
team go 1-15 one year, and then come with-
in a missed field goal of being Super Bowl
Champions the next, like the 2003 Carolina
Panthers?

Where else do athletes celebrate their feats
with pompoms, sharpies, cell phones, and
insinuations of mooning the opposing team’s
fans? Whe knows what Randy Moss will do

next in the endzone, or when T.O. will walk
out on the Eagles, or how long it will take
Bill Parcells to disown his Cowboys and
anoint them worst team in league history?

This season we could see the perennially
atrocious Cincinnati Bengals make the play-
offs for the first time since 1990 and the
Arizona Cardinals take home their only divi-
sion crown in the last thirty years.

But then again, both teams could just as

Panthers’ QB Jake Delhomme is a commodity on fantasy market.

easily resort to their traditional roles as
laughingstocks of the NFL. The point is we
just have to watch.

Everyone—no matter your team alle-
giance—has a reason to tune in.

As if you football fanatics need extra
incentive to devote your Sundays complete-
ly 4nd utterly to football, I urge you to do
more than merely follow your hometown
team. Get in a fantasy football league. Or
two. Or ten.

Freshmen especially should understand

that there is no way to bond with your hall-

expect the most of them.

My problem with that explanation is that
there is, according to Sports Illustrated, more
than a 10 per cent chance that the cover-per-
son/s will die or be injured following the
publication of their photograph.

I don’t think I would call that “regression
to the mean.” .

Or is this phenomenon what one psychol-
ogist describes as “a failure to efficiently
metabolize heightened expectations”?

Or is it truly an evil curse, a jinx that, 937
times, thwarted some of the greatest athletes
that the world ever produced?

Charlotte’s sweet sweet Carolina Panthers,
to whom many of you owe allegiance, were
featured on the Sept. 5 issue, the NFL pre-

‘view for this season.

Will Jake Delhomme be able to break the
curse?

We’ll see in less than a week.

This Sunday’s game will be the perfect
venue for the Panthers to prove that all the
hype is wrong.

The New Orleans Saints, who finished at
.500 last year, beat Carolina in their final
game of the season and caused them to miss
out on postseason play.

Hopefully for you Panthers fans, retribu-
tion will finish above superstition.

With a deep roster and a strong front line,
Carolina should be able to play to their
potential and substantiate all the rumors that
have them finishing in the Super Bowl.

Will they crash like Evel Knievel after his
1974 SI cover appearance?

Get out your lucky rabbit’s feet, Carolina
fans.

This could be a long season.

mates quite like starting a fantasy football
league and engaging in the daily trash-talk
that is sure to ensue.

What’s more, fantasy sports provide an
outlet for those of us who have not been
blessed with the physical prowess to fulfill
our dreams of becoming a professional ath-
lete. In this blissful fantasy world we can live
vicariously through those blessed few. I am
fairly certain that playing fantasy sports is
the only way you can win
any sort of championship
simply by sitting on the
couch eating Twinkies.

That couch, however, is
by no means the ideal set-
ting from which to fully
enjoy the upcoming 17
Sundays. Instead, drive
south on 77 to Exit 28 and
station yourself each
Sunday at either R.J.
Gator’s or Midtown
Sundries.

While current gas
prices will make this two-
mile trek cost a grotesque
amount of money, these
are two highly esteemed
sports bars we are dealing
with here.

Let me tell you from my three years of
experience that the satisfaction of having no
less than six big-screen TVs lined up right in
front of you, all showing different NFL
games, far exceeds whatever price gas could
ever reach. |

Get your work done early (or later) and go
reap the benefits of DirecTV’s NFL Sunday
Ticket.

So, it is the start of a new academic year,
and that can only beg one question: are you —
ready for some football?
