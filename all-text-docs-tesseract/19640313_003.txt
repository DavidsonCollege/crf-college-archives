S C PLAYER OF THE YEAR AND MORE
PERHAPS...

Fred Hetzel will try-out for the Olympics. Friday, in

a special meeting of the Executive Committee, Hetzel

as given official permission to compete in next fall’s
ames.

The academic arrangements necessary to allow
Hetzel to play next fall were considerable; the task of
making the team will be considerable also.

The Olympic Committee invites 30 college basket-
ball players from at-Jarge to try out for the team. Seven
juniors were asked; Hetzel is one. Try-outs begin in
March at Kansas City and include practice sessions and
exhibition games. The next round of try-outs then moves
to New York City where about 96 basketball players
will hold final practice prior to the selection of the 12
man United States basketball team. 1

The 96 players with whom Hetzel will compete will
be the best amateur players in this country and the
chances of making it are difficult to determine. Right
now I'd say Hetzel has a good chance.

Fred Hetzel is a friend of mine and I don’t think
it would betray any confidence to say that he wants to
play on this team more than anyone can know. The honor
of being asked to try out for such a team is considerable
but the honor of representing this whole nation against
the finest basketball players ir the world is one of the
highest honors that an athlete can receive.

I'd like to thank for myself, Hetzel, and a great many
others, the interest, assistance and understanding shown
in the decision which treated a new situation in a new
yay and allowed Fred Hetzel a chance to receive this

onor.

Good.luck.
IN THE STUDENTS’ BEST INTEREST...

The Faculty Athletic Committee met recently and
made several suggestions to the administration with re-
gard to next year’s basketball program. Two of these sug-
gestions should be of particular interest to the student
body and for that reason, I believe they are worth noting.

First, the committee recommended that provisions
should be made to provide students with seats along the
sidelines for all Coliseum games. This recommendation
included the Ohio State game but excluded all other
games to be played during the Christmas holidays.

Second, the committee recommended that the school
should provide a certain limited amount of free transpor-
tation’ for all games played in the Coliseum. This trans-
portation would be for those students who are unable to
find any other suitable means of travel.

In light of the many complaints and mutterings of
the past few months, these recommendations seem to
meet a problem which a nationally ranked team has
caused. Any sudden change in a given situation is sure
to produce certain difficulties and even inequities for a
period of time. To some extent, this has happened this
year. What is more important. however, is the flexibility
of old ways and the concern of campus leaders to remedy
the situation. To some extent, this has already begun to
take shape.

The committee also made a third recommendation.
They recommended that the basketball schedule be limit-
ed to a maximum of 23 games. Dr. Marrotte explained
the reasoning of the committee when he pointed out
that the Southern Conference schedule had bee shorten-
ed by one week because the Tournament is now played
one week before it used to be held. The committee felt
that with an abbreviated schedule period and a longer
schedule, the games would be bunched together in such
a way as to place a difficultburden on the players. On
the basis of this, they ~fecommended the schedule be
limited. -

All of these recommendations were the result of an
effort on the part of this committee to recognize and
solve several problems which have just recently arisen.
The fina! solutions have not been effected but there seems
little doubt that they will, and with their solutions a real
service will have been rendered to the student body.

COACH OF THE YEAR. . .

Although this is certainly neither new nor surprising,
Coach Driesell was named for the second consecutive
year as Outstanding Coach in the Southern Conference.

Earlier this week Driesell expressed that this award
was made to himself for the efforts of a great many—
this team, the assistant coaches, and managers.

No one can find any arguments with these sentiments
but by the same token no one can detract from the job
that Driesell has done since he has been here. He recruit-
ed them; he managed them; and they won. He brought
national prominence both athletically and academically
to this college to a degree never known before..

I wonder right now if he wouldn’t trade it all for one
more basket on a Friday night not so long ago.

OH, BILL BRADLEY...

The spectre of the tournament system rose from the
relative death of journalistic comment and bit the South-
ern Conference where it hurts the most—its best interest.

For on Monday the Southern Conference Tournament
champion dropped an 18-point decision to the Ivy League
Champion, a team which Davidson had mauled earlier and
a team which West Virginia could have very probably
beaten. ;

If VMI was the best representative team for the
Southern Conference, then I find it hard to believe that
the prestige of this conference has ever been lower.
Strangely enough, however, in a year that with the ex-
ception of Duke, it was superior to the ACC.

NO. 10...

For the first time in the history of Davidson College,
a team finished in the top ten teams as compiled on the
final ballot by the AP and UPI.

Five Seniors Bow Out
In Disappointing Meet_

BY BILL BRIGGS

“We ran a good tournament for West Virginia and VPI. They really enjoyed it.”
With those words Coach Charlie Parker summed up the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment held in Davidson last Friday and Saturday, March 6 and 7. West Virginia took
five firsts in the tourney with VPI taking two. The other first place went to The
Citadel. West Virginia won the crown by b:ating out VPI, VMI, The Citadel. and Dav-
idson. The Mountaineers scored 74 points; VP! had: 59; VMI, The Citadel, and David-
son scored 44, 30, and 14 points respectively.

Besides having the outstand
ing team of the meet, West Vir
ginia also had the outstanding
individual competitor. Roy Sisler
was the most valuable wrestler
of the tournament and received
the trophy for the most falls:
Sisler pinned a}l three of his op
ponents in winning the 177 pound
class.

Davidson's disappointing fin.
ish in the meet was a hard pill
to swallow after the great ex-
pectations of the pre-season
prognosticators. Despite a
mediocre 3-7 record, a

‘Cats Finish Season
With 4-7-1 Record

Last weekend the 'Cat
swimming team capped
their 4-7-1 season record
with a sixth place finish in
the Southern Conference
Tournament. “Everyone did
a fine job for us,” said
Coach Dwight Shoe after his
squad narrowly missed beat-
ing out West Virginia in the
tourney at Charleston. S. C.

After failing to qualify in the
500, Jim Grey tied for fourth in
the finals of the 1650. Al] six
finalists broke last year's record
time—first place going to a time
of 19:36. Grey himself carded
a 20:29. Another good perform
ance was turned in by Jim
Stokes in the 100 butterfly. His
57.7, good for second place, was
only .5 second off the record.

Bud Frye and Mark Wald-

on qualified in the 200
breast; Jim Downey and John
Alexander qualified for the 200
back. In the fatter event,
Downey took sixth and Alex-
ander tied for fourth. The 400
medley relay team composed
of Alexander, Frye, Stokes
and Hughes beat their prev-
fous best time this year by
four seconds; thelr time of
4:10 was just a second off the
school record.

While VPI was running away
with the meet, only a handful of
points separated The Citadel.
West Virginia, and Davidson and
only one point separated the
latter two, Said Shoe, ‘This is
much better than last year: and
with the freshmen I have now,
it’s going to be a lot better next
year. You know, in our dual
meets this year our opponents
had to set new school records to
take several of our strongest
events.”

Shoe failed to comment on one
of the more interesting events
in the S. C. tourney—the manag-
ers’ 100 individual medley. Zach
Long breezed to a fifth place
among the six entrants but in
all fairness, three of those who
beat him had previously been
on their varsity squads. The
future of the event is in doubt.

fairly

good showing was still expected
from the team in the tourna-
ment. but fale must have had
other plans for the Wildcat. grap
plers.

Johnny Webb, Mike Bisard,
Hugh Allen, Sam Glasgow,
Butch Allison, Bill Pridgen,
Bitly Mills, and Russ Walls
all went down in defeat.
Bisard and Mills were beaten
by one and two points, re-
spectively; both had been
given a good chance to capture
first or second place in their
weight class, but both had to
settle for third instead.

The ‘Cats won only two
matches during the entire tour-
nament. Bisard

Hazelwood of VMI for his third
place finish and Glasgow beat
DeForrest, also of VMI, for an
other: third. Mills captured his
third as the result: of a default
by Miller of VPI.

Davidson's grapplers now hang
up their tights after a rather
disappointing season. Injuries
and first semester graduations
hurt the team much more than
anyone expected. Seniors Billy
Mills, Russ Walls, Sam Glas
gow. Bill Pridgen, and Dick
Wray will have to be replaced
for next year, Coach Parker still
looks forward to a squad with
more depth, brought by the addi
tion of five or six of this year's

outpointed freshmen.

ATO's And Sigs Deadlock
For Title In Final Game

There is no joy in ATO land, the great Taus have):

finally struck out. Yesterday afternoon, a scrapping team
of Independents, who had split their eight previous games,
defeated the previously unbeaten ATO cagers °37-31 in
the Taus’ final game of the season and thus managed what
is beyond question the most surprising and dramatic up-
set of fhe IMAC season. The loss enabled the Kappa Sigs,
who had already completed their season, to deadlock
with the Taus for the league championship and thus

share the title for the second consecutive year.

Dave Johnson led the winners
with 17 points, almost half the
Independents’ total, while ATO
aces Pat Hubbard and: Rufus
Adair were held .to 10 and 8
points, respectively, by the tight
zone that held the Taus to their
lowest point output of the year.

The Independents took a
quick lead and never traited,
as Johnson and Benny Coxton
completely dominated the re-
bounding. Commented Gary
Martin, who contributed 8
points fo the victors’ ledger,
“They played us man-to-man,
so we drew their big men,
Rufus Adair and Mike Payne,
outside away from the boards
so that we could control the
rebounds.”

Asked about the loss, Adair
commented. “We just got beat.”
They did. and thus fell some of
the luster from the team many
still believe to be the best ever
in the IMAC.

In yesterday's other action,

the Phi Gams tightened their
hold on third place by edging the

honors. The Gams need a. vic-

their final game in order to
clinch the third position, while
the Phi Delts need victories in

Wednesday afternoon, “I doubt

senior Earl Cole. Although
Cole is playing the position for
the first time, he appears to be
able to handle the job. Either
of these two men might take
Earle’s job.

In the games against Pfeiffer,
next Tuesday and Friday, the
‘Cats will be looking for revenge

three innings this early in the
season: I want to see as many -
pitchers work as I can. We have
a lot of work to do before we are --

We'll have to find a combination
for these positions if we are to
have a good season."'

The pitching staff is balanc-
ed and strong. Last year’s
leading pitchers, junior Dave
Johnson and senior Eart Cole,
are back. Juniors Barry
Teague, Paul Briggs and Ron-
