| THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1993

Unfortunately, several people
have misunderstood a piece I wrote
afew weeks back. But, thatistobe
expected. Not everyoneis going to
see where I’m coming from or
what!’m getting at, and that’sokay.
People are going to see what they
want, that is the curse of subjectiv-
ity. However, to leave the tune on
the present note would leave the
reader who has been keeping up
with all of this an impression that I
see as misleading.

First, if anyone who read my
opinion was hurt, that was not my
intention. If you’ve got clinical
depression or other problems and
you’re taking Prozac, or any other
drug, to help you get through, I
wish you the best of luck. I wasn’t
criticizing you, and I hope you do
whatever it takes to get on with
life. That is the nature of survival.

Second, the letters which fol-
lowed my column made it look
like the issue was a question of the .
“informed” versus the “unin-
formed.” This is very misleading.
For too long, lay persons have sur-
rendered their opinions to almighty
experts who, sadly, are merely lay
persons of another sort. I wish to
impress upon the reader that) my
opinion is not uneducated or less

Why are Americans so
depressed?

valid than those of the people who
have written in to the editor just
because my opinion is in the mi-
nority. There are many doctors
who agree with me.

My column wasn’t about
“door deals” or Prozac. My col-
umn was about a trend. There is a
trend of trying to get something for
nothing. It treats symptoms in-
stead of problems with the pseudo-
logic that if there are nosymptoms
there are no problems, It is child-
ish in nature, like children who
make frightening things go away
by closing their eyes. There is a
trend of trying to escape from life,
often by chemical means.

I don’t think that it is a coinci-
dence that since the dawn of Prozac
and other contemporary psychiat-
tic pills more and more people are
getting depressed. From USA To-
day, Wednesday, April 14, 1993:
“The suicide rate among adoles-
cents climbed in 37 of the 50 states
in the last decade, and a report by

Northwestern National Life Insur-
ance Co. hints that the numbers
might go even higher. From 1980
to 1989, teen suicides increased by
18 percent, and the insurance com-
pany found that 86 percent of its
adolescent cases in ‘91 and ‘92
included treatment for suicidal ten-
dencies or attempts.” Why are
these numbers going up?

This is a national problem.
According to Perot’s United We
Stand, we are 5% of the global
population but consume 50% ofits
drugs. Why are the constituents of
perhaps the wealthiest nation the
most eager people to get away from
themselves? Why should we ofall
people need to escape so badly?
Not surprisingly, there are similar
statistics involving Prozac. Ac-
cording to Time magazine, Octo-
ber 11, 1993, “In the U.S. an esti-
mated 900,000 to 950,000 prescrip-
tions are filled each month” (my
italics). Andone more quote, same
source: “Since its introduction five

years ago, 5 million Americans —
and 10 million worldwide — have
used [Prozac].” Why do we con-
sume 50% of the world’s Prozac?
Why are we so depressed?

Just to back up my point that
we are indeed so depressed, I prof-
fer the following quote. Again,
from USA Today, Thursday, April
15, 1993: “One in 8 Americans
suffers major depression at some
point in a lifetime, and about 11

- million Americans are depressed

in any given year.”

Notonly is this a national prob-
lem, but a Davidson problem.
Prozac isn’t the only drug that can
be abused. National Alcohol
Awareness week recently expired,
but I think Davidson students are
all too aware of alcohol. There is
aritual of slaving during the week
and doing one’s best to forget it all
on the court. “Steve,” they’ll say,
“we work so hard, and need some
kind of a break, a way to let go.” I
counter this with the fact that when
you’re doing what you love, your
work becomes play, a break in and
of itself.

I have been presented with
arguments ranging from insensi-
tivity on my part to the cost effec-
tiveness of drugs versus analysis.

The entire issue is touchy, scary,
and I refuse to defer to “experts.”
Yet, during a freshman humanities
lecture, Dr. Mele presented the
hypothetical construct that there
was no reality as such, but rather
that we were brains in vats, and we
were being fed our perception of
reality through a computer. Some
students shrugged this off and went
back to sleep, but others were dis-
turbed. It mattered to them that
their lives were real, not illusions.
Likewise, there is a very real dif-
ference between counselling
through a problem (even though
expensive), and quicker, chemical
treatment. It matters.

I’ll conclude by revealing the
reality of this trend, as it relates to
Prozac. In the mentioned issue of
Time, a Prozac patient and writer,
Elizabeth Wurtzel, finds herself
missing the person she used to be.
She has struggled with severe de-
pression since age 11.

She says, “Now I go to parties
and everyone says, ‘I’m on Prozac
too.’ You can just walk into a
doctor’s office and say, ‘I think
I’m depressed,’ and he writes you
a Prozac prescription...If they feel
bad, they should figure out what’s

‘wrong with them.”

Homeless need opportunities, not shopping carts

Sleeping continued from page 10

shopping cart would be less moti-
vated to change his situation.

These placebo solutions can-
not continue.

Theonly way tosolve the prob-
lem is to motivate those who are
homeless to .become productive
members of society. Their lives
must be cleaned up and they must
be taught to take advantage of op-
portunity.

In addition, the large percent-
age who are mentally ill or ad-

_ dicted to one substance or another
must be helped.

A more intelligent argument’
for helping the homeless is pre-
sented by Peter Singer in his essay
“Rich and Poor.”

His thesis is that we are obli-

ing the scenario of a small child
drowning in a shallow pond, Sav-
ing the child would cause us to lose
nothing more than a clean pair of
pants and dry shoes, therefore, we
are obligated to act to save the
child.

Singer’s argument makes per-
fect sense in that scenario, but it is
the wrong example to use when
speaking of aiding the homeless.

By comparing a homeless per-
son to a drowning child who is
unable to do anything about his
situation, the homeless person is
stripped of the ability to assert him-
self.

Itis this very ability that must
be recognized if the plight of the
homeless is to be improved. Giv-
ing them shopping carts and a Con-
Stitutional right to beg are incen-
tives to remain homeless—there

homelessness advocacy is to stress
the fact that the Inverse Commit-
tee is free from them. They run a
solid and upstanding program that
does true good for shelters such as
the Uptown Men’s and the Salva-
tion Army Women’s and
Children’s Shelter. They do not
promote placebosolutions, but help
the homeless obtain skills needed
to function fruitfully in American
society.

Whether you sleep outside or

not is a personal choice; I do not::

feel itis a necessary part of helping
the homeless. They need more
than compassion—they need
people who can teach and moti-
vate. Do not stop at the sleep-out,
but act on the compassion you
have. I must thank Kim Kreiling,

I live with an alcoholic

The ninetiesis the era of twelve
steps. Support groups following a
common format are sprouting up
all across the U.S.:. Alcoholics
Anonymous, Gamblers Anony-

mous, Over-eaters Anonymous,

Al-Anon, Ala-teen, Ala-tot, and
Adult Children of Alcoholics.

So far, knock on wood, the
latter group, ACOA, is all Ineed in
my life. My father is an alcoholic.
I am his son which makes me an
Adult Child of an Alcoholic. That
does not mean I am an Alcoholic.
Isimply grew upin a family weeded
with dysfunction.

Theneighborhood thought my
family to be perfect or “normal”.
We had a white picket fence, two
and a half car garage, the best pri-
vate schools, we “summered” in
Martha’s Vineyard, and wore
clothes from Talbots and J. Crew.
I was invited to every party and |
was liked by everyone at school.
So where is the dysfunction?

Nobody needs to know my
life history but they should know
the effects of growing up in an

alcoholic family. Here are some
characteristics of an ACOA or
somebody who has survived a simi-
lar environment.

ACOA’ sover-react to changes
over which they have no control,
seek tension and crisis and then
complain about the results, guess
at what normal is, and judge them-
selves without mercy. They have
difficulty with intimate relation-
ships, take themselves very seri-
ously, are super responsible or su-
per irresponsible, and are impul-
sive. Often they feel different from
other people, fear rejection and
abandonment yet reject others, and
constantly seek approval and affir-
mation.

If you identify with any of the
above traits and are interested in a
mellow support group for adult
children who grew up or are still
involved in an alcoholic/dysfunc-
tional family, please call Hal at -
6032, PO #2890 or Dr. Crosby
(Counseling Center) at-2451. This
group and all contact will be ex-
tremely confidential.
