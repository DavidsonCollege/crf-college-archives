this doesn’t appear to be the case.
We all have the tendency to do
only things that are easiest for us
to do, and I think it is much easier
to cast a vote when they are
right in front of one in chapel than
to go to the trouble of going by a
poll. Thus, I am in favor of having
the votes placed before the stu-
dents in chapel as has been done

in previous years.

points.

Rod Turner, Sophomore:

After seeing thesresults of the
election system, I am_ stiil very
much in favor of it. It has cut out
politics to a great extent, although
I am still inclined to think that
the Davidson campus will never
be free of this contamination. In
answer to the question concern-
ing interest in voting, I would say
that a representative per cent of
the student body participates in the
elections. I believe that as time
goes on, more students will become
interested and will. vote. Only time
and trial will prove whether or not
this system of election is superior
to the former one.

T. P. Johnston, Junior:

| think that the present up
is quite satisfactory. If a person is
interested.to vote, there 1s no
hindrance to casting a ballot. The
old system involves “stuffing the
ballon box and politicing.” The
new system eliminates these evils
and deals with the elections in an
efficient manner.

Regardless of how votes are gain-
ed, -probably the_ best qualified
candidate will get the office. How-
ever, the present Elections Board
produces a more clean-cut decision

set

among the candidates.

Sam Woodward, Sophomore:
Although we haven't heard much
from the board about their results,
there are certain questions that
have arisen. Is the set-up getting
a_ good ‘representative of voters
from the student body? I have seen
so many cases where boys fail to
vote that it is possible that only
a small per cent of the students
are voting. Also, have combines
been eliminated by this system? I
certainly hope so, but there is no-
thing definite. I think the set up
will have to be given more time

before we can say whether it is

good or not.
