LETTER

Censorship Spurs
Moral Cleansing

Te the Editor:

Spurred on by the forward-
looking action of the Union
Board Executive Committee
in their decision to censor
the “Groove Tube’ (here-
afjer teferred to as ‘‘Exhib-
it A” due to the odious
and suggestive nature of its
name), we enter into a more
positive course of action to

_ insure the preservation of the
pure, and moral atmosphere
of the Davidson College Com-

y.

a unfortunate showing of
Exhibit A in our union has
planted the seed necessary
for the rebirth of a long
awaited moral_re-armament.
The challenge is here. Will
we rise up to it?

We ‘re not letting our mo-
thers down. How about you,
methers?

We of the Moral Rehabili-
tation Front acclaim the
liberation of the union. For
the protection of our’ mem-
bers, this conquest must be
further extended to embrace
more than just:our union.

To cool the several hotbeds
of moral indignation on our
campus, we must thrust
ahead: into the Stowe galler-

In addition to the cleans-
ing::of the art galleries from
this. un-American influence,
we suggest that the Asian

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Budget Cut Dulls

To the Editor:

I have receatly learned
that Dr. Scott, along with
the Chambers’ administra-
tion, is considering a large
cut. in the soccer team’s
budget. This cut will mean
the elimination of part of
our, schedule and the reduc-
tion of hecessary equipment.

Despite a 10-3-1 record and
Southern Conference cham-
pionship; despite .the in-
creasing popular support of
the sport; despite the organ-
ization of the Davidson Soc-
cer Club as a planned year-
round activity; despite the
fact that soccer coaches and
players have actively re-
cruited, without. subsidiza-
tion, over 60 applicants for
admission, many of whom
are excellent students and
players; despite the success,
enthusiasm, and _ contribu-
tions to the school, the
administration has responded
weakly.

This indifference, coupled
with a_ substantial budget
cut; is landing a demoraliz-
ing blow to the soccer pro-
gram at a critical stage in
its development. More South-
ern Conference titles are in
sight as well as entry into
the NOAA play-offs.

Soccer does not need sub-
sidization nor high-powered
financing; but we must have
our full schedule and pro-
per equipment if we are to
continue to improve and
develop as a_ successful,
winning team...

‘“‘Ginimie Shelter’ is based,

on ‘the Rolling Stones’. 1969
tour of the United States,
which culminated ina fiasco

of a free concert at Califor-
‘nia's-Altamont- “Speedway.

During the course of the

tour, the various events,
concerts, meetings and press
conferences were filmed by
no less than 28 cameramen.
The film was later edited and
compiled to: form an_inte-
grated whole that | would

« accurately depict the exper-

jence encountered along the

>way.

To say, however, that the
purpose of the film is to
document the success of the
tour would be tov miss the
point entirely.

ak,

$5,000 for meals which fresh-
men ate at the union instead
of at their assigned eating
club.

Simple mathematics tell a
much different story. As-
suming that there are 300
freshmen (the actual figure
is closer to 280) who were
assigned over the winter
quarter to eat two meals
per week for eight weeks~at
eating clubs, then the total
number of meals eaten by
freshmen would number
4,800.

Since meals at the Union
are priced at $1,10 and $1.35,
this means that the maxi-
mum debt that the college
could incur if 300 freshman
ate every meal at the Union
would be $6,000. In other
words 5/6 of all meals that
freshmen were assigned to
eat on the court were eaten
at ‘the Union. ,

As freshmen who partici-
pated (reluctantly) in the
new system, we Can assure
you that this was not the
case.

From this it can be seen
that the college is attempting
to pass off economic coercion
(who would pay to eat.in the
Union if he could eat for free
elsewhere?) under the guise

< of a-loss of money at the

cafeteria.

The facts are that the col-
lege could rot have lost
$3,000 through freshmen in
the Union; and even if the
college did lose this money,
wouldn’t it seem to indicate
the widespread dislike for
the new system of eating
clubs among freshmen?

The administration's lack

of honesty and integrity in,

dealing with its students in
relation to these and other
concerns is what has filled
