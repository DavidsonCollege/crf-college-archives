TAMING THE WIND: Sailors engage in

| Francis grabs NC laurels

in summer sailing events

By CLIFF GARDINER
Staff Writer

Senior Dave Francis has”

improved tremendously as a
competitive sailor since coming
to Davidson College.

Francis competed in two
major regattas late this sum-
mer. In the middle of August,
he claimed an eighth-place fin-
ish in the Force Five (sailing
class) North American Cham-
pionship at Hampton Roads,
Va. Then, on September 6 and
7 in his hometown of New Bern,
N. C., Francis captured the
North Carolina State Cham-
pionship for the Forte Five
class, a division of small sail-
boats designed for medium-
strength winds.

These impressive showings
come from someone who had
sailed in only one organized

race before coming to
Davidson. However, Francis
shies away from putting too
much stock in his rather glam-
orous title, North Carolina
Force Five Champion.

“It sounds a whole lot bigger
deal than it is,” Francis said.

In fact Francis candidly ad-
mits that winning the second
race of the five-race North
Carolina regatta “was really
kind of a fluke, I felt.” In that
key race Francis’ two main
opponents made the horren-
dous error of sailing about
one-half mile past a mark.
Francis capitalized on the mis-
take to take first place in that
particular race which, com-
bined with steady third-place
finishes in the other four races,
gave Francis the top spot over
the other ten sailors in the
N.C. Championship.

In the August regatta, Fran-
cis had come back from a
disastrous forty-seventh place
finish in the first race of the
North American Champion-

ships. He was_ successful
enough in the next six races to
achieve his strong eighth-place
finish during the fifty-four boat
meet.

Francis indicated that his
showings in these two summer
events, plus his three years of
experience at Davidson, have
bolstered his confidence for the
sailing competition at school
this year. Despite his expecta-

‘tions that the competition in

the South Atlantic Intercolle-
giate Sailing Association (to
which Davidson belongs) could
be the toughest since he has
been here. Francis commented,
though, that he thought he
could hold his own now.

Captain of the Davidson
team, Francis will sail “A”
Division this Saturday, Sept-
ember 20 in Charleston, S. C.,
for Davidson's initial fall con-
ference regatta. Crewing for
him will probably be Laurie
Bingaman, a freshman. Sopho-
more Chuck Barrineau will sail
“B” Division for Davidson.
