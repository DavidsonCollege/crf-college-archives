McKelway speaks on South Africa in 900 room

By ANDY BALL

Religion professor Alexander
McKelway addressed an audience
of more than 75 people Tuesday,
giving impressions of his recent
two-week trip to South Africa.

McKelway was part of a nine-
member delegation of educators
that ‘made the trip in late
November to witness the prob-
lems in South Africa first-hand.

Much of the program centered

around the resolution of South Af-
rica’s problems through the use of
disinvestment. McKelway aid,
“disinvestment should be con-
tinued but should be done so with
the understanding that it could
possibly lead to increased vio-
lence.”

McKelway encountered a var-
ied cross-section of South African
society during his stay. He partici-

pated in meetings and consulta-
tions with government officials,
business executives, members of
the press, educators and black
township leaders.

Although McKelway _ sees
South Africa’s situation as “al-
most intractable,” he sees hope
coming from the church. He urged
the audience not to be deceived by
current opinions about the situa-

tion. “Doomsaying about South
Africa has become very popular
recently. This kind of prophecy is
very self- fulfilling, but falla-
cious.”

McKelway proposed several
resolutions to South Africa's
problems, including: revocation
of the Homeland Policy and Pass-
Laws which prohibit accessability
to certain areas of South Africa to

blacks, state funding for black
eduction and the release of Nelson
Mandela. He also advocated talks
with Mandela’s party, the African
National Congress.

McKelway’s presentation was
one of a series of programs spon-
sored by the Dean Rusk program
in order to increase public aware-
ness of the problems of South Af-
rica.
