most thrilling game played on the Uni-
versity floor this season, Davidson lost
to the Carolina quint, 28 to 22. David-

sure basket work. Carolina’s nervous-
Ness was overcome in the second half

the count in her last game on the trip
when Trinity walked off with the big
end of a 30 to 24 score. The game was
a hard fight all the way thru and the
score was repeatedly tied. Davidson led
by the narrow margin of one goal five
minutes before the last whistle, but the

out. The line-up:

“We Say So.” “They Shall Not Pass”

time and tide being of another breed, it
was impossible even for the class of ‘19

“They Shall Not Pass.”
impossible for them to prevent the pass

vide the feast of eloquence, and Pebble,
so famous already as the aid to Demos-

wore neither his Tuxedo nor his Prince
Albert, and tho he traveled neither by
the modern aeronautical way of the Kite,
nor in the good old fashiend way of the
Brown Mule, yet he managed to put the
Picnic Twist on his delivery. He gave
us a Velvet oration, one mellowed by
nature.’ He brought smiles on the face
and gladness in the heart as he rapidly
approached his Climax. and when at
last his supply of Bull Durham had run
out there was terrifice applause.

After a careful consideration of the
whole of Junior Speaking we can but
agree with the author of the War Beau-
tiful. If war is beautiful. then there
must be some good even in Junior Speak-
ing.

CLEMSON DEFEATED.

Davidson wound .up a very successful
basketball season when she defeated the
Clemson Tigers on the new Alumni
Gym floor last Saturday, 37 to 22. The
game was a fitting climax to a season
which only unavoidable injuries and mis-
haps have kept from being a clean sweep.
and was the most exciting part of the
Junior Speaking program. The David-

Since it was

son scoring machine was alittle ott
form, King not being able to cage the
leather with his usual) consistency, duc
no doubt to the presence of so many fair
visitors in the gallery, but Hengeveld,
the big blonde center, whonr no femi-
nine wiles can flustrate, more than made
up for the shortcomings of his teans-
mates by tossing goals nonchalantly from
all) angles and positions. When he
finally tired of making points, he, had
totuled 20 points, more than half Da
vidson's entire score. MeAskill did
good work at guard, breaking up several
attempts at concerted assault on the bas-
ket by the Vipers. Clemson's passing
proved a little troublesome to break up,
but their agressiveness got them nothing
but the credit due to acscrappy loser:
Hall played good ball on the floor, work-
ing the ball up to Henpeveld and King
and adding a couple of markers himself,
For the visitors, Colbert and Ford
starred, Colbert's offense being about
the only real basketball that the visitors
showed. Bryant at center also played: a
good scoring game. “The season closed
with this game, and Davidson hung up
a record of seven won, four lost, out of
eleven games, a record that the Wild
cats can well be satisfied with, when the
adverse circumstances under which the
last trip was taken is considered.

CONCERT.

The Orchestra and Glee Club gave
an excellent concert Saturday night be
fore an unusually large and appreciative
audience. The eighteen selections were
well given, and brought forth much ap-
plause.

The program began with “The Star
Spangled Banner,” sung by the entire
Glee Club, which was followed — by
“Over There,” plaved by the Orchestra.
‘The quartet number “Camouflage,” was
well rendered and called for several
encores.

EF-dgerton made his initial solo before
a Davidson audience with “When the
Creat Red Dawn is Shining.” He gave
as an encore “His Lullaby.” He was
follawed by the Mandolin Club, with
an unlooked for comedy number.

J. L. Fowle sang “For You Alone”
and “Wait Till the Cows Come Home,”
both selections being greatly applauded.
“It’s a Long Way to Berlin,” and “Your
Flag and My Flag.” sung by the entire
Glee Club, were especially enjoyed.
This concert was made the occasion

FIELD PROBLEMS WORKED
DURING DRE HOUR

Ly

The drill ‘Tuesday and Wednesday,
the 26th and 27th, was very interesting
and quite a relief from the nionotony of
the regular close order drill. On ‘Pues-
day Company “B” was the enemy who
had entrenched themselves on the golf
links. Company “A” sent out) scouts,
who located the enemy and brought the,
information back to headquarters. Cap-
tain Grey immediately set out to cap
ture the enemy; but just as he was pre-
paring to make the final charge Captain
Lea ordered assembly as he did not
want any bloedshed. On Wednesday
things were reversed and Company “A”
took up a position in a pine thicket “be-
hind trenches and barbed wire entangle
It took the scouts of Company
“B” some time to locate the enemy po-
sitions, but when they did Captain Pet-
ers’ company came down on the enemy in
good style.

The scouts have not been able to do
very effective work on account of the
shortness of the time which necessitates
haste; but every one seemed to enter into
the spirit of the affair and all went as if
they were hunting Germans in No-
Man's land.

A signal squad of eight men has been
practicing regularly for the past week
and bids fair to soon be proficient enough
for service in scouting work.

Beginning today the time of drill has
heen chaged from the afternoon to the
early morning. The first bell will ring
at 6:18, allowing 15 minutes for dress-
ing. The companics will fall in at 6:30
and drill till 7:30. This will allow 10
minutes for getting to chanel. By this
nlan those trving out for baseball will
have the whole afternoon in which to
nractice.
