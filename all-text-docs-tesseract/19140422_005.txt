ATHLETIC associa-|*
TION.

ALUMNI

At present Davidson is supposed to
have an Alumni Athletic Association,
| but it is not effective, and should be re-
organized, for we never hear of it. do-
ing anything. Almost everv other. col-
lege has a very active association of this

kind; for instance, Carolina has one
that has helped greatly to raise — the
standard of athletics at Chapel Hill.

Davidson has as loval alumni as any col-
lege in the South, and we believe that
they will rally to the support of this
association, and re-organize at  Com-
mencement.

*Davidson needs the aid of such an
association for many reasons. First, the
team managers are handicapped by the
fact that on the crip expenses are just
made, while on the home grounds, the
student body being small, the backing
received i is barely sufficient to meet run-
ning expenses. It stands to reason,
therefore, that there is no mone: left to
buv equipment for the team. Asa con-
sequence the local assgciation has vearly
been going decper and deeper in debt.
There is always material for good
teams, and with help from the alumni.
better teams can be put out. An able
assistant caach .is needed nest Fall in
foot ball. for it is impossible for one
coach to look after four teams. /

With a good . Alumni. Association
backing, with the present. track material.
Davidson could send out one of the best
teams in the State,

Now, everv loval alumni should. be-
long to this association and heln David-
con to keep abreast with the other rival
college teams which are vearly getting
better and better. Tf then each alumni
would join- and pay a certain snecified
amount of money annually for the svo-
port of athletics, the standard of the
“Red and Black Machines” would he
tremendously increased. Before next
Fall it is honed that this association can
be in good ‘working order.
