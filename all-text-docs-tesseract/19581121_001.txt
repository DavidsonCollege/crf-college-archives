Soft Sell Makes ‘‘Y’”’
A Financial Success

t

Vernon Broyles, President of
the YMCA, was interviewed by
members of the DAVIDSONIAN
staff this week. Questions and
answers are as follows:

What is your evaluation of
the Y’s program this year?

“Last year primarily was one
of study and interpretation of
the Y's job in the light of our
contemporary situation. We set
up the present. reorganization,
and this year is the experiment-
al year, to see if this is a valid
reqrganization.”

“Already we've found some
things that need to be changed,
but I think basically it’s a good
reorganization ... . I think in
the past we’ve put too much
emphasis on the financial as-
pect.”

Edwards Speaks
At Sunday Service

The Vespers speaker on Sun-
day, November 27, will be Dr.
Albert G. Edwards of Raleigh.
Dr. Edwards was born in Scot-
land and came to the -United
States to study engineering at
Georgia Tech. In Atlanta, while
attending Dr. Peter Marshall's
church, he decided to study for
the Presbyterian ministry.

After studying at Presbyte-
tian College and Union Semin-
ary in Richmond, he served as
Minister to the Presbyterian
Church of Orange, Virginia.
During World War ITI he served
with the Army Medical Corps.
Having served as Chaplain to
Woodberry Forest School, he
filled pastorates in Harrison-
burg, Va., and Durham, his
present position.

He received a Doctorate in
Divinity from Davis and Elkins
College, for which he has served
as a trustee.

By CHARLES CHASTAIN
Davidsonian Associate Editor

“Somewhere around five to
six hundred.”

How many did you have last
year?

“I think about six hundred
and fifty. We still have some
loose ends to tie up in the mem-
bership drive . . But even at
this unfinished point we're sev-
eral hundred dollars ahead of
last year. Our Vesper offerings
have been considerably higher
than last year.”

°

You say you’re not empha-
sizing the financial aspect,
but you just spoke of the
Y’s progress in terms of
money.

“I think a greater financial
sacrifice indicates a greater in-
terest .. . . Our primary pur-
pose this year is to provide as
many outlets for student inter-
est as we can.”

Do you think that by using
the “soft-seli” approach, Sead-
ing to @ smaller membership,
the Y runs the ‘risk of be-
coming a small group with-
out important campus-wide
influence?

“No, though we may have a
slightly smaller number of stu-
dents. I don't feel a man’s
spiritual growth is strengthened
by having YMCA under his pic-
ture in the annual... IE we
can get a number of interested
students, then we can show the
rest what we can do.”

“We're more interested this
year in doing something with
everybody that expresses an in-
terest. I personally feel that in
this using of maybe a smaller
group, we can show once again
that the Y does have application
to the student body.”

Are you satisfied with the
present advisor situation? Do

you faver having the College
Chaplain handle the Y, or
would you prefer a profes-
sional Y worker in addition to
the Chaplain?

“I feel that a vital part of a
campus Y is an adult whose in-
sights are respected and to
whom the students can come
when they have a problem.”

But do you feel there is —

too much work for one man
to do both jobs?

“I think the jobs are com-
patible — I think that one man
can do both.”

Are you satisfied with the
present relationship of the
Y and the national Y?

“] think I'll know more after
I go to the National Quadren-
nial in December. I'll for the
first time be able to see the
national Y at first hand.”

Does the Davidson Y have
an obligation to support na-
tional programs with a social
emphasis, such as their racial
policy?

“Of course, a campus Y is
autonomous to a very large ex-
tent. I think it’s the duty of the
campus Y's to govern policies
in accordance with their own
situation. I don’t think any na-
tional policy is necessarily ap-
plicable to every situation. .

I think the point at which we
follow the national Y most is}
the ecumenical aspect.”

Have you had any member- , visor of dormitories, recent-

ship meetings this year?

“Jack Lewis was here for the
first one, but there was a very
poor turnout.”

Why?

“I don’t know.”

“Have you had any more?”

“No.”

But they are monthly meet-
ings?

“Yes.”

Critic Praises Actors
In Masquers’ “Ghosts”

The Red and Black Masquers
presented “Ghosts,” by Henrik
Ibsen, Thursday through Sat-
urday nights, November 13, 14,
and 15, in Chambers Auditor-
jum.

In “Ghosts,” Ibsen eliminated
all antecedent action of the
“plot,” dramatizing only the
critical situation. The story
centers around Mrs. Alving, an
advanced thinker for her time,
widow of a dissipated husband
who had given a respectable ap-
pearance to ‘he world; Oswald,
their son, who has just returned
from Paris and is suffering
from a mental illness brought
on by a congenital venereal di-
sease.

Other characters are Man-
ders, the pastor, who doggedly
holds on to respectability and
morality at all costs; Regina,
Mrs. Alving's maid, who is Al-
ving’s illegitimate daughter in
reality; and Jacob Engstrand, a
drunk who had married
Regina’s mother.

GHOSTS?
At first, the title seems to

By FRANK NYE
Davidsonian Drama Critic
refer to the wanton traits of
Oswald's father that show up
in his son’s behavior, and to the
disease he has inherited from
his father. But on deeper exam-
ination the real “ghosts” the
play deals with are nineteenth
century, middle-class ideas of
respectability and convention,
which Ibsen breaks down, blow
by blow. Mrs. Alving had been
forced to live with her disso-
lute husband because of a wife's
duty to her husband. The or-
phanage that Mrs. Alving is
erecting with her husband's
money has not been insured be-
cause Pastor Manders _be-
vtieves it would be showing a
mistrust in God, It burns to the

ground.

In his review in the “Char-
lotte Observer,” Dick Banks
complained that his wooden
seat got harder and harder as
the play progressed. Perhaps
Mr. Banks refuses to accept Ib-
sen on Ibsen’s terms. There is
almost no action in the play—
everything depends on the dia-
logue, and an undivided atten-

LY

tion must be directed toward
it to grasp the ideas. Few play-
wrights reward us so richly for
our attention as Ibsen.
CONVENTIONAL SET

The Masquers followed the
conventional Alla Nazimeve
production set in almost every
detail. and the lighting was
especially good in the “fire”
and “sunrise” scenes.

George Kemmerer and
Miriam Seawell were outstand-
ing as Oswald and Mrs. Alving.
Miss Seawell's performance was
consistently excellent through-
out, and Kemmerer could be
convincingly placid or fiery, as
the scene demanded. George
Johnson showed understanding
and acting ability in the char-
acter role of Engstrand.

Warren Womble played well
the hypocrite, Manders, but oc-
casionally over did his stiffness.
Sandra Goodwin, as Regina, was
the only disappointment. She
never seemed to grasp the sig-
nificance of. her lines, putting
a strain on the other actors in
her scenes.

Spring Frolics Dates
Altered By IFC Vote

The IFC voted unanimously to change the Spring
Frolics weekend to April 24 and 25. Conflicting campus
activities necessitated the shift of date, originally set for
April 17 and 18. The decision was reached at the Novem-

ber 17, Monday night meeting of the IFC.

A Male Chorus tour, sched-
uled over the weekend of April
17, stimulated the IFC to in-
vestigate the activities calendar
for a more suitable date. IFC
President Vernon Anderson as-
signed Don Coffey, SAE repre-
sentative, to study the situation.
He found the baseball team also
out of town over the weekend
in question.

The following Friday and
Saturday (24 and 25) would
have the Male Chorus back
from tour and the baseball
schedule would open on Fri-
day night. Also a tennis
match is to bo played on the
local courts that weekend,
which would be an added at-

in this light the IFC
made the change of date.

Ralph Triplette vacated the.
PiKA position on the council
due to medical reasons. He has
left school for this semester
for treatment. George Gladstone
was delegated to occupy the Pi-
KA seat and was recognized by
the Council as the new repre-
sentative.

The Red Cross Blood Drive
has begun under the auspices
of the IFC and ROTC Depart-
ment. Donor ‘cards have been
distributed to all ROTC stu-
dents and further canvassing
will be conducted in the fra-

Mrs. Moore Lauds
..|Davidson’s Dorms

Mrs. J. B. Moore, super-
ly made two trips through
the Carolinas to observe
the dormitories at other
colleges. Upon her return
she stated, “I was quite
pleased with the dormitor- |
ies here at ‘Davidson in com-;
parison with the ones that
I visited. The physical
plants here equaled or sur-
passed those of the six col-|
leges that I visited.”

Mrs. Moore stated that David-
son’s new dorms compared fa-
vorably with the new dorms of
the other schools. But she also
mentioned that the older ones
here usually surpassed those of
the other colleges that she visit-
ed. Of the six visited, only
two had janitors to elean the
individual rooms. At the other
four schools. the boys had to
make their own beds and keep
their rooms in a clean and tidy
manner.

She also brought out that the
other colleges had stricter rules
concerning the dormitories. The
maximum penalty was a week's
campus for an unusually messy
room.

Wash basins were very un-
usual in the rooms at the other
schools, but she brought out
that many of the situations
were similar to those here. One
was the manner in which the
boys signed up for rooms, and
at some places the boys waited
all night in line so as to get cer-
tain rooms. Overcrowdedness
was also prevalent in all the
schuols due to increased enroll-
ments.

The majority of the fraterni-
ties on campus have now been
introduced to the United Fund!
Drive and are taking action for
blanket contributions. Several
of the IFC members voiced a
desire to have the United Fund
representatives return, allowing
their fraternities to see the
drive film covering United
Fund work. President Anderson
approved this measure and
agreed to make the necessary
arrangements with the United
Fund headquarters.

It was a dark winter night at
Davidson and about as cold and
.damp as a night ever got in the
year 1892. The hour was late
and most students had already
turned in for the- night,
across the campus one lone soul
hurried back to his room. Sud-
t denly the heavy stillness that
enveloped the ground was shat-
tered by the snarling scream of
some animal. The boy halted in
his tracks and listened as the
beast continued his wail. The

walls of old Ghambers resound-
ed with the cry which now
seemed to come from every
corner of the campus.

Satisfied that he had heard !

enough, the boy continued his
short journey with renewed in-
terest. It must never be said
that he ran to his room out of
fear—but that our friend was
eager to make sure that his fel-
low students were given the op-

portunity to hear what he was |

still hearing. An_ interested
group soon gathered and decid-

ed that some wild animal, pos- -
sibly some wild cat had roamed |,

up to this civilized hill. But
the visitor must have felt -at
home here, because he re-

mained in the area to serenade “x

the campus for many nights to
come.

Mr. Charles Montgomery of
the class of ‘93 goes on to re-
late this story as he personal-
ly observed it. He says,
