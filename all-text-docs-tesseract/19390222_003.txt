Question

of the Week

This week the DAVIDSONIAN is
going to continue the question of

last week, because it considers that
this issue is one of current interest
not only to Davidson students but
also to students and young people
all the United States. This
question has been asked in many

over

and has been discussed

over and over again, but each boy

columns
has certain definite convictions a-
hout girls and we have invited some
boys to air these convictions.

The question “What do you
like or dislike in particular about
girls?”

Sid Sample, Sophomore:

This is an old old discussion, and
I've heard many different ideas on
the subject, but I'll take my girl

short, dark, and handsome, with
lots of personality. I think a girl
should be a good conversational-

ist and have a keen sense of humor,
without being silly. She should be
able to discuss athletics and other
things which interest boys without
bringing in her last date or what
her rich uncle has done. She should
not be stubborn about her likes
and dislikes, but keep up a lively
conversation on whatever is brought
up and at least seem interested in
and appreciative for the entertain-
ment the~boy~is*trying to give her.
Leonard Fisher, Senior:

Girls the most part are an
evasive type. To keep a fellow gues-
sing seems to be a virtue or per-
haps good politics. They like to
keep a guy around who does not
really know where he stands with
them and so can be used, on con-

for

venient occasions. Perhaps the only
trouble with this—if it can be
called trouble—is that if the “worm
will turn” they usually realize his
value. Therefore it amounts to this

—worry for a while, fellows, and
soon you will have them where
you want them. “Call me soon,

won't you, hon?”

Bill Walker, Sophomore:

I prefer girls with attractive per-
sonalities, and ones who are capable
of carrying on an interesting con-
versation. Beauty always helps, but
and _ friendlinéss
more essential in my opinion, Girls
who mimic Indian warriors, and
especially if they do so in public
are unbearable. Fickleness and self-
ishness are also extremely undesir-
able qualities.

Bill Fetzer, Freshman:
I like a girl who likes to have

personality are

a good time, one who likes to go
out with a group on skating parties,
etc. I don’t like a girl who is catty,
or one who wants to gossip all the
time. Good sportsmanship is essen-
tial.

Bob Williams, Sophomore:

The girls who have qualities that
make my must list will be not
necessarily beautiful but. will have
a neat, attractive appearance. Also
she will have a keen sense of humor
and sharp with that will go with
her ability to think seriously and
deeply when there is the occasion to
form a very pleasing personality.
Some girls do not realize that boys
would like to be friends with them,
they think that each boy would
like to be a sweetheart to them.
I like the girl who can be enter-
taining even though she is not in
favorable circumstances.

By Court

Last Friday, February 17th,
at twelve-thirty, the entire
freshman class was campused |
for a period of one week by |
the Court of Control.

Julian Squires, judge of the Court |

said that this sentence was imposed |
on the freshmen for their extreme |
negligence in wearing their caps, |
for their refusal to carry laundry |
for upper-classmen, and for unpre- |

cedentedly breaking the old tradi-

tion of speaking to everyone on the
campus. This is the second time this
year that this situation has occur- |

Court, to be a sadly lacking factor
in campus life at Davidson, and the
members of the Court, not to men-
tion upper-classmen, desire to see
more of it—especially on the “haids”
of freshmen). It is strongly proba-
able that each individual member
of the whole class will be required
to show a cap OF HIS OWN in

will be lifted. It is hoped that all
boys who are hoarding caps will
rise to the occasion and cooperate
by spreading the ownership of a-
