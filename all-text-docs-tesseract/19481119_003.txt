Committee Announces Administration

Of The George F. Baker Scholarships

Plans for the administration of
the $50,000 George F, Baker schoT-
arship Fund were announced in
Chapel this week by Professor
Bradley D, Thompson, secretary of
the committee. These plans were
drawn up in accordance with the
conditions laid down by the George
F. Baker Trustees,

From three to five scholarships,
ranging from $300 (tuition) up to
$1,000 or more, will be awarded an-

tee may in four years be as much
us $4,000.

These scholarships will be the
highest academic honor Davidson
bestows upon her undergraduates,
Names of the scholarship »holders
will be published each year in the
catalogue, and in the commence-
ment program, and will be given
ether publicity. The amount of the
award will in no case be made pub-
lic.

nually to seniors in high schools and ‘The purpose of these scholarships
eal

preparatory schools who enter Da
vidson College, The awards will be
for merit and will be made on the
basis of competitive examinations.
Need of financial assistance iS;there-
fore, not a primary consideratio’
The amount of the stipend above
$300, however, will be governed
in each case by the financial status
of the individiial. Davitson's inten-
tion is to make the award larye
enough to relieve the grantee of dif-
ficulty in meeting essential college
and living expenses at Davidson.
Each award is renewable} from
year to year for a maximum of foug
years, provided the grantee maiii-
tains a scholastic record of -high
honor and continues*to give safis-
factory evidence of the development
ot the other qualities for which he
was selected. The amount of the
stipend, when so renewed, will be
determined each year after a review
of the grantee’s current financial
situation, The total value to a gran

is to be found in the belief of the
George F. Baker Trustees and of
Davidson College that the strength
of the United States lies in the
quality of its people, and that the
quality of its people depends in part
upon the education they receive.
The United States needs the con-
structive efforts of the best native
leadership it can secure, The George
PF. Baker Scholarships are offered
in the hope of bringing to David-
son young men of outstanding abili-
ty who in future years take an active
part in government and society, and
Whose lives will be a_ significant
contribution to’ the eommunity,

It has been estimated that ong
half of the top ten per cent of high
school graduates each year do not
enter college. The United States can
ill afford to leave so large a part of
its potential leaders inadequately
educated. It is the hope of the
George F, Baker Trustees and of
Davidson some individuals who oth

erwWise would not have sought col-
lege training.

The qualifications required of ap4
plicants are superior scholastic abili-
ty, well-rounded. personality, high
qualities of leadership, and strength
of character. Neither scholastic apti-
tude alone, nor achievement in ex
tra curricular activities alone, is suf-
ficient. Rather, it is the well-balanc-
ed boy with a broad range of abili-
ties and interests who is best quali-
fied to fulfill the objectives of this
scholfrship program.

Selection will be made in the
first instance on the basis of screen-
ing tests given at the applicants’
schools; a certain number who quali-
fy in these tests will be invited to
Davidson as guests of the college
for further examination and inter
views, The Committee will also stu-
dy recommendations, the applicants’
records in extra-curricular activi-
ties, and other evidence of the re-
quired qualifications.

Davidson students who desire
copies of the announcement. of the
Baker Scholarships to send to po-
tential candidates may obtain them
from the Registrar or from-Profes-
sor B. D, Thompson. Applications
for the scholarships must be made
not later than February | to Profes-
sor B. D, Thompson, — Secretary,
