which he presented to Sigma Pi

Sigma, honorary physics fraternity
at their bi-monthly meeting, March
21,

Heavy hydrogen is one of the
newest subjects to be investigated
by physicists. Mr. Coghill based his

paper on the recent discovery of
the fact that not all oxygen and
hydrogen are of equal weight. He

pointed out that this discovery was

made only through the exactness of
