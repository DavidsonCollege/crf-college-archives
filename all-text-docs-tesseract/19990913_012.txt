12 THE DAVIDSONIAN

COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS

In November, Davidson College will have
the privilege of hosting Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux,
the world renowned choreographer and director,
when the North Carolina Dance Theatre comes to
campus to conduct a mini-residency program.
Bonnefoux will instruct fifteen lucky Davidson
students in a Master's class, discussing various
aspects of dance including: movement, interpre-

tation, and performance. Members of the NCDT
will also offer three performances the weekend of
Noy. 12 and 13 in Hodson Hall.

Born in France, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux joined
the Paris Opera Ballet at age 14 and was named
danseur etoile at 21. He has also danced with the
Bolshoi, Kirov and New York City ballet compa-
nies. During his ten years at NYCB, he worked
with the great ballet master George Balanchine,
who first encouraged Bonnefoux to choreograph
his own works. Since his final performance in
1980, he has dedicated himself to work as an
artistic director, choreographer and teacher. It is
due to his pursuit of innovations in dance that
Bonnefoux will not be a stranger to the Davidson
Campus.

Jean- Pierre Bonnefoux has been working
closely with Herb Jackson °67, a renowned ab-
stract painter and profesSor of art at Davidson
College. Together, they have created a unique
artistic collaboration that will fill Charlotte’s
Blumenthal Center Belk Theater with color and
motion on the weekend of October 1 and 2, and

Arts & LIVING
Jackson sets the stage for dance premiere

give art lovers a revealing look at the creative
process.

Photos of Jackson’s painting in succeeding
phases of its creation will be projected onto the
floor and back wall of the stage and onto the
dancers themselves, covering them with changing
colors as if they were inside the painting. The final
projection will reveal Jackson’s finished work.
When the dancers leave the stage, Jackson will
speak to the audience, and then the artwork itself
will be put up for auction, with
proceeds benefitting NCDT.

A Celebratory Creation

This unique form of dance
presentation is rarely seen, ac-
cording to Bonnefoux. He has
chosen to produce and premiere
it to help kick off the NCDT’s
30" Anniversary Season. “I have
always thought Herb’s work is
so theatrical,” said Bonnefoux,
“It’s a different world and you
want to enter into that world.”

Likewise, Jackson is a long-
time supporter and subscriber to
NCDT performances, and has
served on its regional board of
advisors. “I love dancers, their
intensity and their grace.” Jack-
son said. “And they work so hard
for their art and the community
for such little financial reward.”

Behind the scenes

After the two men met at an
NCDT event, Bonnefoux asked
to visit Jackson in his studio.
During that visit, he became in-
trigued by Jackson’s creative
process, layering coats and coats of paint on can-
vas; at the same time, he scratches and scrapes the
canvas to reveal previous coats and bring com-
plexity and depth to the final work. “It was so
inspiring to see his paintings,” said Bonnefoux. “I
told him right there I wanted to work with him
some day.”

As they talked further, Bonnefoux developed
his ideas for a production designed to give audi-
ences insight into the artistic process. “I don’t
think people have any idea what Herb goes through
to come to the final result, and I think that will be
interesting for people to see,” said Bonnefoux.

For his part in the collaboration, Jackson
allowed a photographer to record the 20" x 40"
painting at 16 stages of its creation. During the
premiere, it will be projected on the Belk Theater
back wall and floor through large format projec-
tors, or “light cannons” at 12 times life size.
Bonnefoux said he will mirror that glimpse at
Jackson’s artistic process through the choreogra-
phy of his dance. “I will have groups of dancers on
stage who perform separately, then: have them

moving together to show how individual move-
ments blend in the final composition,” he said.

Jewels in Charlotte’s Crown

Jackson said he never dreamed of being part
of a dance creation, and is especially pleased to
have been asked by Bonnefoux. “It’s an immense
honor to be on the stage with NCDT,” said Jack-
son. “It’s incredible that Charlotte has this level of
dance company. A lot of folks haven’t seen them
and don’t know how world class they are.”

The creation will also reinforce Bonnefoux’s
reputation as an innovative artist who is putting
Charlotte on the national map of dance. Since he
began directing the troupe in 1996, the NCDT
budget has doubled to $2.7 million, and he has
staged several world premiers. Last year, he engi-
neered another successful collaboration with a
visual artist, projecting huge images of dancers in
performance on big screens on the stage, giving
the audience an entirely different perspective on
the dance as it occurred. He emphasize that work-
ing with Jackson will not only present a new

collaboration to the audience, but should also
contribute to his own personal artistic growth.
Bonnefoux said, “I work frequently with musi-
cians, but it takes a little courage to try something
new. However, the new technology is very excit-
ing to explore. I believe this work will help me
become more than what I am now.”

Jackson is donating the painting, which has a *
retail value of more than $5,000, to the NCDT, and
photographer David Ramsey donated his service
as well. Charlotte gallery owner Jerald Melberg is
also donating. 1,000 posters of the painting to
NCDT so that all patrons at the premiere can take
home at least some rendition of the work they will
see on stage. NCDT officials say the auction and
poster sales will go a long way toward helping
meet the organization’s contributed income goal
of $632,000 this year.
