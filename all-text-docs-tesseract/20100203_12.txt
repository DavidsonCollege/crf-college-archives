The Davidson men’s basketball
team played some of their best ball
of the season last week, knock-
ing off the league-leading College
of Charleston Cougars 86-71 on
Thursday night (Blackout Belk)
before fighting their way to a gritty
overtime victory Saturday night
against The Citadel.

The Wildcats broke open a
close second half against the Cou-
gars by ending the game on an 18-4
run. The run was keyed by Will Ar-
chambault’s °10 two-handed dunk
on a backdoor cut that gave David-
son a 78-71 lead with three minutes
remaining. Charleston did not score
the rest of the way. Archambault
added a three-pointer with 1:22 to
play to make the score 82-71 and
ice the victory.

The dominating finish was a
far cry from the effort produced
by the Wildcats to begin the game.
Charleston hit four of their first five
three-pointers and jumped out to a
23-9 lead to begin the game. The
Wildcats eventually settled down,
though, and fought their way back
to a 36-36 tie at halftime.

SGA Presidential debate sets stage for elections

CaROLINE Woop
News Editor

On Monday night, students
gathered in the Union to hear
Student Government Association
(SGA) Presidential candidates
Rayna McKenzie ’11, Kayla Mc-
Cann 711, and Kevin Hubbard 711
discuss their views and ambitions.

Although only around 40 stu-
dents attended the debate proper,
the union was filled with students
casually listening in, and the can-
didates’ performances during the
debate reflected their established
positions.

The debate was moderated by
Meikaela Zwieryznski ’10, current
SGA President, and Brett Willis
”10, current Editor-in-Chief of The
Davidsonian. The debate, which
began with opening statements
from each candidate, consisted
of seven questions chosen by the
moderators.

Each candidate was allotted
two minutes to respond to each
question, after which the modera-
tors asked questions submitted by
the audience. The debate ended
with closing statements from each
candidate and a farewell from
Zwieryznski.

The candidates used the open-
ing statements as a platform to enu-
merate their intentions for a pos-
sible term as SGA president. Hub-

bard began by assuring students, “I
want to bring improvements you
can actually see.”

He stated that these improve-
ments might include providing
CatCard payment options at Harris
Teeter, installing water fountains at
outdoor activity courts, replacing
vacuum cleaners in dormitories and
encouraging more campus-wide
events.

McCann stressed campus rela-
tionships, saying, “I would like to
facilitate greater interaction with
faculty outside the classroom” in
order “to make us more of a Da-
vidson community.” She also men-
tioned the importance of improving
campus facilities, especially creat-
ing more study spaces.

McCann mentioned soliciting
student input about curriculum
changes and the need “to look at
Activities Tax Council propositions
closely so that we don’t feel like
we’re wasting our money.” Mc-
Cann concluded by stressing cam-
pus safety efforts, from emergency
phones to icy sidewalks, on which
she broke her own arm this week.

McKenzie departed from the
other candidates in stating that she
would not make empty promises to
students, but that she would con-
tinue ongoing SGA initiatives, in-
cluding the student website and the
SGA Voices Project. “I am more
concerned with what you, as a Da-

vidson student, need,” she said.

The first question Willis posed
springboarded off of January’s
Winterfest. “What is your opinion
of Davidson’s current drinking cul-
ture?” he asked, questioning can-
didates on how they would work
to improve social life. McCann
answered, “I do know these issues
exist,” citing her membership in a
Patterson Court organization. But,
she said, “I think we’re all middle-
of-the hill people.”

She suggested more campus
events, including speakers and con-
certs. Recognizing the cost of more
large-scale activities, she con-
cluded, “We can continue to have
big events, but also have smaller
events.”

McKenzie emphasized the im-
portance of deferring to student
input, suggesting the creation of a
“constituency-based group where
senior senators do things for se-
niors.”

Regarding student input, Hub-
bard stated, “I definitely think it’s
feasible and we can create programs
that will bring people together.”

The next question addressed the
candidate’s leadership styles, prob-
ing them on how they “plan to as-
sert initiatives and agendas” to fac-
ulty, alumni and decision-making
boards. McKenzie again stressed

$10 million

gift creates
new scholars
4 program

Friday afternoon at the
Board of Trustees meeting,
Tom Ross ’72 delivered big
news. Davidson trustee Carlos
Alvarez and his wife Malu do-
nated $10 million to Davidson
to establish the Alvarez Schol-
ars Program.

Cited as a supplement to
Davidson’s commitment to
“global education,” the Alvarez
Scholars program will provide
financial support and scholar-
ships to international students,
akin to the groundbreaking
Davidson Trust, announced in
March 2007.

Alvarez was born in Mex-
ico, but has lived in San Anto-
nio, Texas since the ’80s, where
he founded the Gambrinus
Company in 1986, of which he
is currently the President and
CEO. Despite beginning as a
small beer importer, the com-
pany has since grown. to have
branches and partners across
the U.S., as well as in Italy. In
addition, Corona Extra, whose
sales and marketing fall under
the command of Alvarez, is the
top imported beer in the US.

Alvarez and his wife Malu
were introduced to Davidson
when their daughter, who grad-
uated in 2002, was a student.
While their daughter attended
Davidson, the Alvarezes served
on the Parents Council. The
Alvarezes also have one niece
who graduated from Davidson
in 2007 and another who cur-
rently attends Davidson.

The Alvarezes have also
been generous supporters of
Davidson initiatives in the
past. They are the donors of the
student union, which was dedi-
cated in their name in 2001, as
well as supporters of various
scholarships and renovations
throughout the years.

In 2003, Alvarez became a
trustee, serving on the Admis-
sion and Financial Aid Com-
mittee. As part of this commit-
tee, Alvarez worked on creat-
ing the Davidson Trust, which
ended the provision of loans in
students’ financial aid packag-
es, replacing them instead with
grants. This move allowed the
college to meet the full dem-
onstrated financial needs of all
