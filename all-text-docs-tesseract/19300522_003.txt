Football Again

With the last baseball uniform turned
in, and school nearly out for this year,
interest is being turned toward football
prospects for next year. It is barely over
three months now before 40 or 50 young
Wildcats will be reporting to Monk and
Tex for the first fall practices, and soon
after that, the first game. Football at-
tracts more interest than all the other
sports put together, and we are glad to see
it just around the corner.

That Finale

The final baseball game of the season
against Duke turned out to be a Breat
disappointment, both as to the quality of
ball displayed, and as to the score. Kugler
turned in the best game of his career, only
to have his efforts wasted because of poor
support. The frequent errors of the David-
son infield looked all the worse in the
light of the sparkling plays of Duke,
whose infield has gone up to the majors
almost to a man.

Kugler allowed only six hits, two of
them of the scratch variety, and kept
them so well scattered that not’ more
than two came in any one inning. A
look at the score book shows only two
earned runs for the Blue Devils. In-
stead of being a comparatively easy
shut-out, the game should have been
one of the best pitchers’ duels staged
this year.

Kugler has succeeded in holding the
hard-hitting Blue Devils to fewer safe
blows than the majority of hurlers they
have encountered, batting mark against
the Davidson Captain was 171 ‘for the
two games. As a team, they have been
hitting well above the .300 mark. Kugler’s
last two appearances against them form
a fitting close to his college baseball
career.

Letters for Golfers

We believe that more recognition should
be given the members of the golf team
in the awarding of letters than they re-
ceived at present. Under the present sys-
stem, a man must be a member of the
team for three years before he receives
his monogram in the sport. Should not
the sport be put on the same basis as
tennis?

A case in point! Capt. Jack Pepper
led his team through the past season,
playing consistently good golf, and
closing the year by winning the state
individual championship in the tour-
nament at Sedgefield. His play last
year was equally as good, and he won

Gridiron Prespects Are
Bright as Season Nears

Team to be Unusually Strong in
Reserve Material—Several
Freshmen Look Promising

In the fall a college man’s fancy turns to
football, in spite of all that educators can
do. And since the time for the annual turn-
ing out is only a little over three months
away, we present here briefly a survey of
Davidson's prospects on the gridiron next
fall. It is only an opinion, and subject to a
great many “ifs.” Nevertheless, no matter
how it is looked upon, next year seems to
be the brightest from this point than any
Davidson team has had in quite a while.

Sixteen letters and one service monogram
were given at the e of the football sea-
son last November these seventeen men
—eleven linemen and six backs—eleven will
report to Monk Younger when he issues his
first call early in September. Those who will
be lost by graduation are Borneo Baker,
tackle; A. L. DeCamp and Lad Mills,
guards; and Red Parrish, Tom Brohard, and
Murray Christian, backs. The most severe
loss will be in the backfield, and in the cen-
ter of the line.

To balance this loss, there is a rather
strong team of freshmen coming up. Sopho-
more material is always green, but they
often make up in fight what they lack in
experience. The fact that five of the reg-
ulars of last year’s eleven were playing their
first year of varsity football shows that these
green men can he developed into porns)
material.

Coming down to positions, we will start in
on the ends. It is here Coach Tilson is going
to have his least trouble. Three lettermen-
Brock, Steve Brown and Jim Proctor—will

second in the state tournament then.
Yet he will not receive his letter until
next spring.

Golf and tennis are games of a some-
what similar nature, each requiring a
consummate amount of skill to play suc-
cessfully. Both are practically on a par
here at Davidson, both in the grade of
play shown by the members of the re-
spective teams, and in the number of men
interested in them.

We are not advancing a change in
the system of awarding the tennis
monograms. But we would like to see
golf placed on the same footing, that
is, the members of the team receiving
a minor sports letter each year that
their play justifies it, and freshmen
receiving numerals. The change is
bound to be made sooner or later.
With three or four good freshmen
coming up to become members of the
varsity next year, prospects are bet-
ter than ever. Why not raise the
status of golf now?

Five Contestants Pass
Sigma Delta Psi Tests

Five men have qualified in the recent
competition and are now eligible to become
members of Sigma Delta Psi, national ath-
letic fraternity, according to Capt. N. G.
Pritchett, athletic director. Those men quali-
fying are: A. H, Whittle, captain of the
1930 track squad; Joe McCall, captain-elect
of the 1931 track squad; R. F. Norton,
sophomore letterman in track; R. E. C.
Roane, all-around athlete, but who has not
made his letter in any sport, and Thad
Brock, captain of the 1929 football team,
and who qualified for the honor last year.

Joe.McCall is leading a large field with
495 points to his credit, and has practically
sewed up the trophy, as there is only one
more event” to be run off, the,.awimming
competition.

Several athletes have passed nearly all of
the requirements for membership in the
fraternity, but still lack four or five events
before being able to be initiated. Among these
is Tom Brohard, a senior and a member
of this year’s football team. Brohard, in the
football pnt kicked the pigskin 53
