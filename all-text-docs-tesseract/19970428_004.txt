Affirmative action at Davidson: a long road ahead

By Mary Clare Jalonick
Editor Emerita

While the number of African
American and other minority stu-
dents is rising steadily each year,
the number of minority professors
is growing at a much slower pace.

The Minority

Kxperiecne
at Davidson

Davidson does not have an of-
ficial affirmative action agreement
with the United States government.
The school operates “in the spirit”
of affirmative action.

This means that the school is
not legally obligated to hire minori-
ties but makes an active effort to do
so. ;

The guidelines

According to faculty search

guidelines, a search is begun with

an advertisement in the “appropri-
ate professional registers and publi-
cations.”

This ad asks qualified appli-
cants to submit resumes, writing
samples, and references to the chair
of the hiring department. The end
of this ad reads, “Davidson College
isan Equal Opportunity Employer;
women and minorities are encour-
aged to apply.”

According to Dean of Faculty
Robert Williams, who oversees fac-
ulty hiring, the guidelines also en-
courage departmental chairs to es-
pecially consider minorities.

In the first section of the docu-
ment, the school asks them to “keep
in mind the college’s desire to in-
crease the candidate pool for four
special categories: 1) minorities
(black, American Indian, and Span-
ish surnamed Americans); 2)
women; 3) alumni; 4) the handi-
capped.”

Director of Human Resources
Andy Brantley, who oversees all
staff hiring, says that the process is

much the same in regards to hiring
staff and administration.

“We are not an affirmative ac-
tion employer, but we are in com-
pliance with equal opportunity
laws.”

However, he says, “I think there
is more that we could be doing.”
Tactics

Searches may include as many
as 200 people, but faculty members
turn in a list of 10 that stand out to
them.

“We encourage faculty to look
at minorities and turn them in with
their top 10,” says Williams.

This is sometimes successful,
he says, but can be a problem when
the minority candidate is not one of
the best. “It’s bad when they are in
the top ten but not the top three,”
Williams says. “Sometimes we in-
terview them anyway to give them
a fair shake.”

The school also tries to open up
positions in fields that are popu-
lated with more minorities.

this year by the English Department
in order to specialize in Caribbean
literature.

Williams says departments are
creating or reinventing positions like
that in order to become more attrac-
tive to minorities.

In staff hiring, Brantley says
the College does several things to
go along with its “equal opportu-
nity” status.

The Human Resources depart-
ment posts employment opportuni-
ties around campus, considers a
minimum of three candidates for
each position, and makes those who
hire new employees fill out a selec-
tion summary explaining why they
chose that particular candidate.
Problems

Assistant Chaplain Brenda
Tapia feels that recruiting is not at
all on the upswing.

She says the numbers have
changed little from when she came
to Davidson in 1985. “I’ve never
known Davidson to have more than
[around five] African-American
faculty members.”

President John Kuykendall
says the current situation is “not
what we hoped from my vantage.
When we came here we broadly,
not technically, set for ourselves a
goal to recruit more racial/ethnic
minorities.... [it] is hard won
progress, it almost feels like you
step forward two steps and step
back one.”

“We have had some success in

recent. years,”.says. Williams, “but
only with African’ American women

[faculty]. We have had a terrible .

time finding African American
males.”

“Davidson has as many full-
time African American faculty
members as all of the other mem-
bers of Leadership South com-
bined,” says Kuykendall. “Robert
Williams has done aremarkable job
at discovering people with true gifts
and persuading them that Davidson
is the place to be. But you look at
that against the totality of the fac-
ulty population, and you see that
African Americans are a minor mi-
nority, even more of a minority than
among students.”

“Tn all of our efforts, we could
make a more concerted effort to
seek diversity,” says Brantley.
“There is more we could be doing to
reach out to the minority commu-
nity, more efforts to advertise.”

He says the “women and mi-
norities encouraged to apply” label
on recruiting ads is a good start.

Female faculty recruiting is no
longer a major issue. Kuykendall
says that “as things have progressed,
[female recruiting] has really slipped
into the background, because by the
very nature of things, many of the
people chosen are women just be-
cause of the way things turn out.
And women are moving into se-
niority, in terms of faculty status, so
many are now department chairs. ”

Williams agrees. “We don’t
really need to make extra efforts to
attract women anymore, because it

turns out that they are at the top
anyway.”

However, says Brantley, there
is an obvious dearth of females in
upper management. “As we have
turnover at the executive level,” he
says, “[female recruiting] should
be aconsideration of the next presi-
dent.”

Why do we have so few minori-
ties?

Williams says certain depart-
ments have more trouble than oth-
ers. “Physics and mathematics have
a hard time [with minority hiring]
because the pool [of minorities
within those fields] is so small.”

The small number of minori-
ties competing for jobs is a major
reason for low numbers at schools
like Davidson. However, there are
other reasons as well.

Brantley points to low turn-
over as a reason for low numbers of
minority staff. “Larger universities
have more opportunities to hire
minorities on an ongoing basis.
Especially in the skilled trades, va-
cancies virtually never occur.”

He also points out location as a
factor. Some recruits may see
Davidson as too rural. “One chal-
lenge that we often have is the per-
ception that Davidson is not at all a
part of Charlotte.”

Location may be a factor in
other ways as well. “One ofthe
things we should be looking at as a
College,” says Brantley, “‘is the en-
vironment created for minorities and
the perception of the climate here.”

Tapia thinks the climate of the
College and the town is not a major
issue. “The community does not
have a lot to offer African Ameri-
cans, but I don’t think that would
keep anyone from coming here,”
she says. “Charlotte is not far off,
and Atlanta is only four hours
aWay.”

Instead, she says the College
would have more minority faculty
members if it offered more attrac-
tive packages to minorities.

“One thing that I have always
seen in the 47 years that I have been
familiar with the College is that
anything Davidson wants, Davidson
gets,” she says. “There is no impe-
tus there to recruit minorities.”

She feels that Davidson is los-
ing out. “It’s their loss. Looking
down the road, I’m wondering what
it will do for the College.”

Slow progress

When comparing us to other
schools, Williams feels Davidson
is about average in regard to minor-
ity recruiting.

“Weare probably more diverse
than many other schools in the south,
and we are definitely more diverse
than we were ten years ago,” he
says.

Kuykendall feels that the Col-
lege will be working on this issue
for many years to come. “I feel
more gratified than satisfied —
that’s to say, I feel like we have a
long way to go. Ican’t see too many
years down the road. It’s one step at
a time.”
