TAILORED AT FASHION PARK ,

This progressive age con-
stantly discovers a_ better
way of doing things—always
improve s — develops
processes that excell.

Our tailors at Fashion Park,
for instance, have developed
the Turole tailoring treat-
ment—a method of making
“soft” clothing possessing
all the fine lines that well
groomed men demand.

There’s Always a Better Way of Doing Things

EFIRD’S

Turole is pliant—has easy,
comfortable lines—conforms
to the wearer’s action or in-
action—is thoroughly dis-
tinguished.

The Turole tailoring treat-
ment is available in a series
of interesting style develop-
ments—we’re making a spe-
cial exhibit of them now.

The Alumni Department is indebted to
Mr Jackson for the following extract
of a letter received from K, G. Tucker,
cx'23, telling of his trip abroad during
the past summer. The letter is quoted

| verbatim.

| DAVIDSONIAN I keep the pulse of the
| Hill at hand, yet it seems like a genera-

tion since I “help build” the East and

West dorms.

“Last summer I took a spell of wander-

lust and landed at ‘Manila, P. I, via Ad-
mieral Passenger Lines as deck ‘dog,’ |

C, R. Wilcox, now president of Dar- |
lington School for Boys, in Rome, Ga.,
was graduated from Davidson College in
the class of 1911. He was president of |
the student body and did much toward
advancing student government and the]
honor system. After leaving Davidson
he was for several years connected with!
the McCallie School. Here he did in-|
valuable work for the progress of that
institution. In 1917 he was a First Ser-
geant in the 327 Ambulance Corps of |
Camp Gordon. In 1918 he was a Second
Licutenant in Field Artillery instruction |
in the Saumur Artillery School in France.
In 1919 he was the assistant director in
the Educational Army Schools of Gievus, |
France. He received his honorable dis-

charge at Camp Lee, Va., in July, 1919.

Was a representative on the Pan-Hellenic
Council. Leaving Davidson after obtain-

fall at the University of Florida, taking

In the mind of every serious
thinking college man there arises a
question—“What am I going to do
after graduation?” This question
presents a serious crisis. It de-
mands a definite decision.
