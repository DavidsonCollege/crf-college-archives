Juniors Get Worried

Speaking Draws Nigh

March 7-9 are the Eventful Days
Chosen by Class.

From all information that is obtain-
able, prospects point to Junior Speaking
as the greatest event since the Ante-
bellum days.

The committee reports that every-
thing is turning out as was expected and
everything is coming along smoothly.
The program has been arranged and the
invitations have been ordered. ‘The
Glee Club will give a concert and ar-
rangements for a basketball game have
been made. ‘The dates ‘for Junior
Speaking are the 7th, 8th and gth of
March.

It is quite a common occurrence to
find a fellow in his room talking to him-
self or wading around in a pile of notes
and clippings. Junior Speaking is three
weeks off. Boys. is your girl coming?

The S. A. T. C. broke into the Se-
nior Speaking last fall and the event was
called off. Nevertheless no one felt
slighted and began at once to look for-
ward to Junior Speaking. Great things
are expected from the Juniors. The

Dr. McConnell Speaks
On “League of Christ”

Speaker Compares the League of
Nations With Christian Church.

“Those of the students who braved the
bad weather to go to the “Y" vesper
service last Sunday were well rewarded
by Dr. J. Mi. McConnell’s splendid talk
ons the subject—"Christian Self-De-
termination and the League ot Christ.
He showed that the condition of Chris-
tians is in many ways analogous to that
of the nations of the world today.

Dr. McConnell defined national ,selt-
determination as the right ot a nation
to work out its own national lite. He
cited Armenia and Poland as examples
of nations which are attempting to’ ger
this right. So Christian selt-determina-
tion is the opportunity for a man te
bring the most possible good out of his
life.

As there is no chance for a nation to
gain its freedom unless it’ first recog-
nizes that it ts oppressed so a man can-
not be saved from sin unless he first
recognizes that he is a sinner and that
Christ alone can save him from the pow-
er of sin. Christians, as well as nations,
must recognize that all men have the
same right to be free.

The Christian people of the world
can no more accomplish anything with-
out getting together in the League of
Christ than there can be any freedom
among the nations without some law as
a guide.

The present Peace Conference pro-
poses to establish a League of Nations
which shall give the right of self-de-
termination to all nations, No one
knows just what the ideals of this league
will be. Myr. Frank Simonds says that
American idealism and the old-time self-
ish diplomacy the struggling for the
mastery in this conference. ‘The ideals
of the League of Christ are known,

Dr. McConnell spoke of St. Paul as
probably the greatest example of what
the League of Christ can do for a man,
He then mentioned several verses of
Paul's Epistle to the Philippians as giv-
ing the ideals of this league, “The one
verse, he said, which came nearest sum-
ming up these principles was Phil. 4:8:
“Finally, brethren, whatsoever things
are true, whatsoever things are honest.
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
things are lovely, whatsoever things are
of good report think on these
things.”

The report of the meeting the pre-
ceding week was unintentionally omitted
last week. Following a vocal solo by
B. FE. Shields and a violin solo by D. ML.
Gaston. Dr. Arbuckle spoke upon the
subject “Keeping the Faith.” He made
a very impressive speech which will long
be remembered by all present. Mr.
Miles was preaching in Salisbury so the
meeting was presided over by the presi-

dent of the Y. M. C. A.

faculty even deemed it wise to put ven-
tilators over the hall, thereby insuring
safety to its visitors.

Dr. W. J. Martin celebrated his fifty-
first birthday on last Monday. Many
happy returns of the day, Doctor!
