ROBERT WILLIAM BEN.
NETT, a member of the class of
530, he came to Davidson for his
B.S. in 1946. Bob was graduated
and joined the Army. While on the

Though it has these names and
hints of others, the Athletic Coun.
cil is not yet ready to pick a new
mentor. At a meeting Friday night
they were only able to agree that
one must be gotten “pretty quick,”

It plans to search the immediate
area for candidates among assistant
coaches, high school coaches, and
junior college solons.

“The man will have to be able
to fit in to the Davidson pro-
gram and be able to eell the
Wildcat Club,” they said,

No information was available on
either Fletcher or Biggers, but it
was learned that Milligan guided
his Richmond squad to the state
championship last year and pro-
duced two conference champs while
-at Darlington School in Rome, Ga.
This was his first year at the helm
of the Augusta prep school.

Answering a wire from the
Davidsonian, Milligan said that
he would have to have more de-
tails about the job before he
could make any definite com-
mitment.

It was about such “details” that
Athletic Director P. K, Scott was
hazy as the week ended.

Despite his negativism in the
telegram, Milligan has been
quoted as saying he “would not
coach at any other college ex-
cept Davidson.”

It was learned that Georgia Tech
has offered him a position as as.
sistant backfield coach, but it is
reported that he is not looking for
an assistant’s job.

There is considerable support for

campus he was chiefly interested
in baseball and basketball and was
a member of the SAE fraternity.

AED Heart Drive
Wins $190 Goal

A check for $190.00, Davidson's
heart drive goal, was given to
Mecklenburg authorities this morn-
ing. Dick Boyd and Cecil Rhodes
presented the money on behalf of
AED which conducted the campus
campaign.

Chairman Cecil Rhodes has been
optimistic and hopes that contribts.
tions will continue to pour in in this
fight against the nation’s number
one killer,

The Heart Fund Drive, sponsored
by AED here on the campus, got
off to its formal start in chapel on
Monday morning, Lefty Vance
took a dive, so to speak, for the
fund, and it was so convincing that
only a few people laughed.

Dr. Elias Faison, after attending
Vance, proceeded to speak on the
serious problem which heart di-
sease presents to this country.

It’s 745,000 yearly victims are
\ samt more than twice the

number of the next highest

death cause, cancer. Tubercu-

losis, which was fatal to only

34,000 last year, is provided for

today with numerous sana-

toriums, and yet the fight
against heart disease is almost

“nil in comparison.

Dr. Faison was followed by Col.
Simpson, chairman of the Meck-
lenburg County drive ,who an-
nounced that the county goal was
set at $17,500,

Last year the national foun.
dation for the fight against
heart disease gave considerably
more money to Duke, Wake
Forest, and Bowman Grey to
aid in their research than was
collected in the state of North
Carolina,

After chapel on the opening day
workers were at the exits to re-
ceive contributions and to give red
plastic heart pins and pamphlets to
those who made donations.

Receiving stations were placed
in all of the fraternity houses and
at the Stud.

On Tuesday the Charlotte Ob-
server made mention of the David.
son drive and asked those attend-
ing the Duke game to be ready to
give. At the game blankets were
passed in front of the spectators,
and donations were tossed into the
blankets.

In 1288 the Scots passed a law
to the effect that “it‘is statute and

ilk mayden ladye .
liberte to bespeke ye (the) man
she likes.”

It continues to say that if he
renegs he gets fined unless of
course the duffer can prove he's
already gotten.

Strange legalism this—giv-
ing license to the vicious horde
of man-hunters that prowl our
societies. Though a historical
habit, this license to become
predatory is the apex of the
current trend in unfair woman-
hood.

Without this day of carnality,
however, there would be an extra
day every four years and an extra
year every 1460 years.

recommendations—only a multitude
of varying opinions and ideas—ex-
pressed in the open meeting of the
committee on elections which met
Monday night.

The general topics of nomina-
tions, platform speeches, and the
signing of the ballots were dis-
cussed by the 20 students, led by
Mac’ McLean, assembled in the
Science Auditorium.

Three plans were brought up
as methods for nominations.
They were :(1) All nominations
will come from the floor and
the man nominated will accept
by bringing a two-dollar fee to
the student body president. (2)
All the men who wish to run
will file with the president and
his name will be entered on the
lists, (3) A combination of
these two plans will be used.
The question as to who would be

permitted to present a platform
caused a long debate. Some of
those present were for allowing all
those nominated the privilege of
speaking, while others were for re-
stricting the number of those speak.
ing to the last five men left after
the ballots had reduced the candi-

Perhaps the most arresting
proposal was one made by Pete
Kalogridis, who suggested that
the platforms be made a social
event. He said they could be
combined with a speech by Dr.
Cunningham, a concert, and a
barbecue,

The reactions to Kalogridis’ idea
were mixed. Some said that it would

Talk, No Action |
At Election Meet

There were no definite actions or | make a farce of the elections and

others thought it would add dignity
to the occasion.

The practice of signing the
ballots, it was explained, was
developed to keep down any
stuffing of the ballot box and
to check on any clique forming.
The opinions expressed indi.
cated that some thought the
signing of the ballots was un-
democratic and against the
principle of the secret ballot.
The alternate method to signing

the ballots that has been approved
by the committee in an earlier mect-
ing was to have no signing of the
ballots. This would be replaced hy
checking off the names of students
as they voted.

Some light on the history of elec-
tions at Davidson was shed by Bob
Walker, He said that a professor
had told him that open elections
were tried in 1940, but there was
such a feeling of contempt devel.
oped from the cheapening of the
offices by the open campaigning
that the men of leadership refused
to accept the nominations. After
this experience, the present election
regulations were adopted,

Whether the editors of the
publications should have plat-
forms and the present proce-
dures of nominating the edi-
tors came in for some appraisal.
It is expected that there will

probably be another open meeting
of the committee before the final
closed session in which the recom-
mendations to the student council
will be formulated, President Mac
McLean predicted.

y|Will Be Repeated

Dr. Ben L. Rose, pastor of the Ceneral Presbyterian Church

ble).

ville on December 12, 1914: His
father; Judge Charlies L. Rose, at.
tended Davidson in 1898 but grad-
uated from UNC in 1900, His

Pygmalion Film
Is ULFS Opener

The United Literary Film
Society opens its spring series to-
night with George Bernard Shaw's
entertaining comedy Pygmalion.

The story is a modern parallel of
an ancient Greek legend about a
sculptor who created a_ beautiful
statue and then fell in love with it.

Shaw’s sculptor is a London
speech professor, his Galatea is a
girl from the slums.

Professor Higgins picks Eliza
up in the vegetable market at
Covent Gardens on a wager
with a skeptical friend and
‘ proceeds to transform her from
a loud, awkward cockney into
a beautiful and graceful wo-
man,

Having done so, he proceeds to
fall in love with his creation, but
finus that there is more to the hu-

man personality than graceful man- |

ners and beautifully articulated
speech.

Pygmalion is one of Shaw's
wittiest and most popular dramas.
Like most of his other plays, it
has a “thesis.”

Shaw's proposition is this:
Speech and language are two
of man’s highest creations but
in his everyday use of these
gifts he abuses them inexcusa-
bly.

A person's speech can be just as
attractive a part of him as his
clothes or his physical appearanice,
and it can be easily improved by a
little careful attention.

But Shaw does not ride this
horse to the detriment of good
drama and he has included some of
