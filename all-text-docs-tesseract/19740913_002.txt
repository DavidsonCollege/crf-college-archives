Coming off the end of one of

the best workshops ever, the
Davidson College Debate
Team-moves forward in an-
ticipation of its best season in
many years.
Captain Paul Mitchell, a
senior from Thomasville,
N.C., expressed satisfaction in
the work that has been done
thus far by the debators.

“T think we are definitely in
for the best season we save
ever had,” Mitchell predicted.
‘‘And that includes being
ranked in the Top Twenty the
past two years.”

Davidson moved up to four-
teenth nationally in its

ivision. No other team in this
area of comparable size came
close to this excellent position.

Mitchell outlined his
reasons for being so optimistic
about the coming season.

“First, we have what I-.ex-
pect to be three solid varsity
teams. This will be the first
year since I have been here
that we have been so strong on
the varsity level.

“Second, we have what is
shaping up to be an excellent
novice team. We could also be
blessed with some surprises
on both levels.

“Finally, we are gathering
more evidence, which is
quality research, for the first
time in a long while.”’

The team met for the first
time on Sept. 3 to begin the
workshop. Two members,
Peyton Marshall and . Tony
Snow, both sophmores, had
been working for a week
gathering preliminary eviden-
ce for the team.

‘Snow and Marshail have
definitely given’ us a lot of
assistance by their early
work,’’ said Mitchell. ‘‘They
are a crackerjack team from
last year and should be able to
compete with any team in the
country.’’

The topic for the season is

“Resolved: That the power «
the Presidency should
significantly curtailed. ’’

Mitchell termed this

. Wildcats are defending cham-

pions in both the varsity and
novice divisions at the event.

Mitchell considers UNC,
which finished second in the
country last year, as the.top
competition in this area for
Davidson.

“Richmond is always our
arch-rival, and they have a
str®g program,”’ Mitchell
said, adding, ‘“‘but UNC-G is
always a pain-iri-the-tail.”’

The team is pointing for the
Peachtree Debates at Emory
University as their yardstick
for the season. This tour-
nament takes place during the
first weekend in November.

At the present time, the,
team has invitations to a great:
number. of tournaments.
Those which the squad will ac-
cept include Catawba, UNC-
Wilmington, Appalachian,

. The question of the future
expansion of WDAV-FM is of
prime concern to.both the
college administrators and the
student station managers.

At the end of August,
college President Samuel: R.
Spencer Jr. sent a létter to
Station Managers Mark Wi-
lensky and Bucky Neal ex-
plaining a change in college
policy concerning the station.

The letter explained that
Director of the News Bureau
Earl Lawrimore. would
assume direct control of the
station’s day-to-day activities.

In addition, Spencer ex-
plained that the Board of
Trustees is given: prior con-
sideration to expanding
WDAV’s power to 50,000 FM
watts. Under ‘such -a_ setup,
professional radio personnel
would be brought in to run the

Jean Cornell, coach of the
nationally ranked debaters,
expressed otimistic hopes,
along the same lines as Mit-
chell.

‘We have been working har-
der this year than ever
before,’’ she said.

“I think we have a good
group of experienced speakers
returning, as well as a fine
number of freshmen. This
year, as well as the near
future, looks very .good for
Davidson debate.”

former Vice ‘President for

the team at least for the
remainder of this year.

50,000 watts,” Wilensky said.
“This means the station will

“become a tool of the college

public relations program and
not an educational means of
student expression. My initial
reaction is that the college
ought to build a brand new
50,000 watt station for their
purposes and leave this one

for the students,” Wilensky
concluded.

manager, the proposed 50,000
