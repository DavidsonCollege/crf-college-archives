For the first time in many years, the
Davidson men’s soccer team controls its own
destiny late in the season. Following a six
game conference winning streak, the Wild-
cats are 10-3-1,
number one in
the Southern
Conference,
and facing a
chance at direct
entrance to the
NCAA tourna-
ment with an at-

large bid.

Davidson’s impressive winning streak,
which began over two weeks ago with an 8-
0 drubbing of The Citadel, culminated Sun-
day in a 5-2 win over Georgia Southern at
home.

Davidson’s success can be attributed to
stingy defense and prodigious scoring. In the
last six games, sophomore keeper Soren

Johnson has
notched
three shut-
1 outs while
0 the ‘Cats
have
outscored
their oppo-

nents 22-4.

Davidson’s most recent win was a 5-2
shellacking of Georgia Southern. Davidson
opened the game hot. Junior Chris Norbet
opened the flood gates, scoring in the 13"
minute off a pass from junior Jon Tetirick.
After beating a pair of defenders, Tetirick
fired the ball into Norbet who was posting up
several yards in front of the goal. Norbet
collected the ball well, turned and fired a
blast past the keepers outstretched hands. At

this point, the Eagles were broken.

Senior Pat Miller added the second goal
minutes later finishing a free kick from junior
Erick Ozimek.

Junior midfielder Paul Watson finished the ~

game-winner in the 23" minute. Streaking
down the left side, Watson collected a beau-
tiful forty-yard ball from freshman defender

David Peoples.

Watson took

the ball hard at

the keeper, fin-
ishing the goal
in full stride.

- Senior

Ikenna Myers
and junior Joel Sadler scored Davidson’s
fourth and fifth goals respectively late in the
first half.

The jubilant celebration which followed
Sadler’s goal revealed just how much the
Cats are enjoying their success.

“I enjoy being out there every single
minute,” Pat Miller commented. “We are
training hard and playing hard and it is satis-
fying to make our style dictate the game.”

Despite such
adominant win
against Geor-
gia Southern,
Davidson’s six
game winning
streak has not

come easily. -

: Following big,
home victories against The Citadel and VMI
over two weeks ago, Davidson barely
squeaked by in three tough away games.

On October 5, Davidson traveled to Wofford
to face an opponent that was ready to fight.
Though eventually falling 2-1, Wofford pre-
sented a lot of trouble for the Cats. Defender
Pat Miller’s game-winning goal in the first
half broke a threatening 1-1 tie.

Women’s soccer places second at
Harvard Invitational, falls to Furman

Press RELEASE

The Davidson women’s soccer team placed
second in the Harvard Invitational recently.
The Wildcats defeated Vermont in the first
round by a score of 2-0 behind goals from
sophomore twins Tara and Heather Maloney.
Harvard defeated the Cats 7-0 in the champi-
onship game. Tara Maloney was named to

the All-Tour-
nament team
for her week-
end efforts.
In a
_rematch of
last year’s
conference
. championship, Furman and Davidson slugged
it out once again, with Furman prevailing 2-
1. The loss puts Davidson two games behind
Furman in
the Southern
Conference,
as Davidson
is now 10-5
overall and
3-2 in the
SoCon.

Early and
often both teams were whistled for fouls as
each side played with a lot of intensity and
physicality. Sophomore Heather Maloney
got the first good scoring chance of the day

‘midway through the first half receiving the

ball on a through pass between defenders, but
the Furman goalie rushed out of the net to
make a diving stop.

Maloney got her revenge-late in the first
half as she lined a shot from the left corner of

the penalty

box to the

upper right
1 corner of the
2 goal, over

the goalie’s

head. The

goal was
Maloney’s team- -leading 15th on the season.
Senior goalie Winnie Corrigan’ made six
saves in the first-half to give Davidson a 1-0
lead at the break.

Furman kept the ball on Davidson’ half of
the field through much of the second half,
outshooting the Cats 9-3 in the period. After
fighting off numerous Furman attacks, the
Paladins broke through on a goal by Emily
Turgeon with seven minutes left in the game.
A feeling of shock encompassed Davidson as
Turgeon netted another goal with just 28
seconds remaining in regulation to give
Furman the victory.

Corrigan ended the day with eight saves.
Furman had a decisive lead on corners, 7-0,
and shots taken, 18-11, in the contest.

Davidson will try to rebound Monday
evening in the final home game of the season
as they take on the Terriers of Wofford with

Things would only gethiedeckoe Davidson,
too. Over fall break, Davidson traveled to
Charleston to face conference rival College
of Charleston.. Not only did they have to face
another team but Mother Nature as well. In
the midst of howling winds, nevertheless,
Davidson pulled off a thrilling 1-0 overtime
victory.

In the sixth minute of the first overtime
period, Jon Tetirick broke away from the
defense off a pass from Chris Norbet. Tetirick
beat the keeper, ending the game with a
golden goal.

Riding two more goals by Jon Tetirick,
Davidson finished its
series of difficult road
games with a 2-1 win at
Appalachian State. De-
spite the inherent diffi-
culties in playing on
astro-turf, Davidson was
able to adjust their game
to get the victory.

Tetirick launched
Davidson into the lead in
the closing seconds of the
first half. Stealing the ball off a Mountaineer
defender, Tetirick fired the ball into an open
goal. The half-time intermission didn’t cool
Tetirick down. In the 48" minute he struck
again. “I just finished the ball that had
rebounded off one of Norbet’s shots. It was
sitting there in a silver platter,” recalled
Tetirick.

Appalachian State tried to mount a come-
back late in the game, scoring with six min-
utes left. But Davidson’s lead was never truly
threatened and the Cats walked away with its.
third, solid road victory.

“We have not always played perfectly, but
we have responded to the challenges,” com-
mented keeper Soren Johnson. “We have
been able to adapt to tough conditions [against
College of Charleston and Appalachian State]

and find a way to
play. our best.”

Miller explained Datidin'an success say: a
ing, “We have people who are ‘gamers.’
People who approach every game profes-
sionally and will play as hard as they can no
matter who they are playing.”

Davidson is pleased with their six game
win streak but believes its work has only just
begun. ‘We still need to prove that we are
one of the top 32 teams in the nation and ©
deserve a spot in the tournament,” said
Tetirick.

In the next two weeks Davidson will get
that chance as they close
the season facing four
soccer powerhouses in
Clemson, Furman,
UNC-G and Richmond.

“These last four game
hold the key to our sea-
son, they are critical in
determining whether we
earn a spot in the tour-

nament,” said Johnson.

Miller put it even
more bluntly. “We wanted to put ourselves
in a position to get into the tournament and
that is what we have done. But these next
four games will answer the question, are we —
good or are we just punks?”

Despite the pressure placed on late season
success, the Cats appear confident. “We will
need a full effort from every player to win
these games... . there is a lot of pressure, but
I think that we will handle it well,” said
Johnson.

. Davidson faces its first big challenge in
Clemson Wednesday night at 6:15 in
Richardson Stadium. Still smarting from last
year’s shocking loss to Davidson, the nation-
ally ranked Tigers are sure to come out fight-

ing.
