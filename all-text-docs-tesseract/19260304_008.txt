Professor Ira B. Cross re-
cently expressed annoyance at the time
taken from studies by feminine students
powdering their noses and freshening
their countenances. He said boys hadj
an equal privilege and rights if they de- |

The club went immediately into the
election of officers for the coming year
and the results are as follows:

H. M. Austin re-elected president.

F. K. Bell, vice-president, replacing W.
H. Bordeaux.

T. T. Jones, secretary and treasurer re-
placign J. B. Webb.

After the clection of officers the club
discussed plans for Spanish ,Night this
year, and decided to secure another set
of slides on some subject of interest to
|the Student Body. Details of this illus-
trated lecture will be announced later.

Further business being dispensed with,
| the social part of the evening’s program
was entered upon. Professor Goldiere
played a number of records from his ex-
cellent collection of classical music, main-
ly Spanish and French compositions;
among them: La Paloma, La Golandrina,
Princesita, Dona Luz de la Luna, and the
Toreador’s Song from Carmen, After
light refreshments and smokes the meet-
ing broke up.

In a basketball game between Georgia
Tech and N. C. State a short time ago,
one of State’s men got his gum stuck in

the roof of his mouth, and it cut off the
flow from the salivary glands as well as
checked his breathing. The game had to
be stopped until he could remove the
gum from his mouth. We suggest that
hereafter he keep his gum greased with

Austin College, Sherman, Texas, has a
spelling team composed of ten spellers
and two alternatives. Inter-collegiate
spelling matches create much enthusiasm
out in the great open spaces “where men
are men and women are governors.”

William and Mary has what is prob-
ably the smallest class on record, a class

one member.

‘“A straight college education leading
to an arts degree is not worth ten cents
as a business asset,” says the great “Red”
