Staff Adds
Five Books

Emil Ludwig’s “The Meditter-

“During the past week the library
staff has added five new books to
its shelves that will be of interest
to the students,’ announced Dr
Chalmers Davidson last Monday.

“The Mediterranean”
Mediterranean” by Emil
Ludwig, is a@ book covering a vast
and interesting subject which em-
braces recurrent causes atid issues
that are being contested on th
shores of the Mediterranean today.
“The Uninvited,” a current best sell

experiences of a man and woman in

a beautiful home, which is consid.
ered haunted. The ending of the
book is very unusual.

“Van Loon’s Lives”

The author, Hendrick Wilhelm
Van Loon, supposedly entertains his
heroes of the past in “Van Loon’s
Lives.” This book is highly interest-
ing and clever. The fifty years im-
mediately following the Civil War,
mingled with a romance of a young
Southerner and her dashing beau

“Drivin? Woman”
Pickett Chevalier,

For a somewhat bawdy, yet won-
derful picture of France before her
downfall, Elliot Paul's “The Last
Time I Saw Paris” will be particu-
larly attractive, it is thought.
