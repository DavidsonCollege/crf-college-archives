Union moves to Johnston Gym

It’s official: Trustees make new College Union next priority

By MAtTTHEw Eiricu

Attheir fall meeting last week-
end the Trustees approved a mo-
tion which empowered the Union
Planning Committee to begin work
on a new College Union.

The motion “states clearly that
the Union is the next priority,” said
SGA President Bill Gullan. Dean
of Students Tom Shandely called
the Trustee’s motion “big news.”

There is no time table for the
Start or completion of the new
Union. Because the capital cam-
paign for the new life science build-
ing is still under way, fund raising
for the new Union cannot begin

until those efforts have ended. “The
number one capital project right
now is the life science building,”
said Shandley.

Shandely offered no estimate
as to how long it would be before
the new Union could begin being
built. It is likely to be a while, he
said, because Davidson’s policy is
not to begin building until half of
the necessary funds are in hand
and the other half pledged.

“Once fund raising for the life
science center is complete, the
College Union will be the highest
priority capital project for the col-
lege and the planning for that Union
can proceed now,” Shandley said.

While the campaign for the

life science building comes to a
close, steps will be taken to pre-
pare for that moment. Through an
anonymous gift of $250,000 the
college has already conducted a
feasibility study to determine if
Johnston Gym could be converted
into the new Union.

Two summers ago, the Col-
lege commissioned a large-space
analysis firm to determine “where
the heartbeat of student life is,”
said Shandley.

The firm decided Duke dorm
is the center of campus. Since
Johnston is right next to the dorm,
the College chose to investigate
whether it could be renovated into
the new Union.

Warner Hall vandalized

By Russ TaRvVER
Associate Editor

Warner Hall members were.

shocked to discover a broken win-
dow and puddles of urine on the
basement floor of their house Sun-
day morning.

Warner Hall President Eliza-
beth Anderson says, ““We’re really
disappointed. This was a pathetic
thing to do, and these people really
need help.” Although Anderson is
concerned about the damage, she
is more concerned that the culprits

might have been alumni. “It is
amazing that you could spend four
years at a school like Davidson and
then return to do something like
this,” she says.

According to police, a student
standing outside of Knox dormi-
tory at around 3 a.m. Sunday morn-
ing heard the sound of glass break-
ing inside Warner Hall.

The student reports seeing
three unidentified females walk-
ing around inside, one of whom
appeared to tape a piece of typing
paper over one of the five broken

panes.

House Manager Katherine
Ross says the building was locked,
and she is unsure how the vandals
entered the building. Ross says
Warner Hall has been vandalized
repeatedly in the past.

“We felt like we had to lock
the house. Every year something
happens,” says Ross. “We know
no one will come forward and ad-
mit that they did it or pay for it.”

Damage was estimated at just
under $100. Police have no sus-

pects.

Using approximately $20,000
of the anonymous gift last year, an
architectural firm was hired to con-
duct the feasibility survey. The
firm answered that Johnston could
“absolutely” be converted, said
Shandely.

This:having been decided, the
planning committee will spend the
next 18 months deciding what
should be included in the new
Union and then working with ar-
chitectural firms to determine what
is possible. The committee will
also contact and visit other schools
to look at their student centers.

How the new Union will dif-
fer from the present one and what
additions and new facilities it will

house are yet to be determined.

Students will be consulted
regularly in the planning for the
new building, said Shandley. “The
facility is first and foremost for
students, and students have to be
very involved in input,” he said.

“The most important thing that
came out of this is that this is the
next highest priority after the life
science building which signals a
commitment by the trustees that
we will have anew college Union,”
said Shandley.

Gullan echoed Shandley’s
comment, “We’ re getting one defi-
nitely, and soonerrather than later.”

Thete are no plans for the
present Union.

Beginning of the
end for the Court

_ Dave Westol, National presi-

= © dentof Theta Chi fraternity, spoke

in Hodson Hall Wednesday
evening on the dangers of hazing
and the need to meet risk manage-
ment guidelines for fraternities and
sororities.

Westol described hazing as
“stupid and illegal.” He said 10 to
15 percent of any fraternity are
hazers who “love to degrade
people.” According to Westol,
most hazers realize that they “never
will have the chance to do it again”
and try.to make the most of their
opportunity to break pledges down.

_ The legal definition of hazing,
which Davidson also follows, is
“any situation created on or off
campus intended to embarrass,
harass, or ridicule.” At its core,
said Westol, “hazing is essentially

‘abusing someone.”

Hazing is a downward spiral,
said Westol. “If you’ve gone
through something, you want to
turn up the gas just a little bit.” So
that hazing will not escalate to
dangerous levels, many fraterni-
ties and sororities are shortening
the initiation period. Pledges will
not be hazed if they quickly be-
come full brothers. “Pledging is

seniors to strive to act as mentors

fore.
