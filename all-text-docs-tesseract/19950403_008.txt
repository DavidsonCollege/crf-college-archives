How strong are you?

Davidson College creates a
unique atmosphere for each of its
students. We are all given two
opportunities: we canexplore new
cultures and beliefs through
Davidson’ s, albeit minimal, diver-
sity, Or we can ignore new chal-
lenges because Davidson has cre-
ated a comfort zone for its stu-
dents. We don’t have to meet new
people who we may feel uncom-
fortable around, and we can use
lack of time as an excuse. Yet in
order to have a complete educa-
tion, we must be willing to step out
of our comfort zones.

As a veteran Davidson Col-
lege student, I recognize the need
to focus on academics first be-
cause of the workload we all must
endure. Then, most of us have
athletics, socials, semi-formals, and

committee meetings to think about
as well. So why should we make
time toexperience different peoples
and different cultures? We should
because a complete education does
notcome from books alone. Theory
is good, but experience is better.
Experiencing one another is
extremely vital when trying to
make things comfortable. We have
comfort zones because we have
experienced things within ourcom-
fort zones. Wouldn’t it be nice if
every aspect of campus life was
part of your comfort zone? Imag-
ine what you could learn, You
could experience other countries
while never leaving the Unitted
States. You could experience the
North while never leaving the
South. And if you’re really dedi-
cated, you could learn how to do

the butterfly ata BSC party. If for
no other reason, having a diverse
background sure looks great on
your resumé,

The simple way to experience
is listening with a caring and sen-
sitive heart. The difficulty lies in
doing and interacting with people
you don’t know. The great part is
knowing you have learned and
grown because of those difficult
experiences. It’s time we chal-
lenged our ourselves. For the re-
mainder of this semester, you
should test your ability to grow.

Start a conversation with
someone you’ ve never met before.
Write a controversial article for
The Davidsonian. Approach that
person you’ye been dying to ask
out. Experience a BSC party for
the first time. Listen inona FLAG

meeting. Run through Chambers
naked! (maybe not that extreme).
We have to find a way through this
fear and apathy that keeps us com-
fortable.

I’ve always been taught that
the shortest distance between two
points is astraightline. So why are
we trying so hard to walk around
our problems? When are we going
to face up to the realities of our
society? Why not start today?
Political correctness and conser-
vatism only allow us to overlook
real issues and simultaneously con-
ger up idealist ones.

I know the difficulties and re-
wards of stepping out of a comfort
zone. I came to Davidson from a
high school that was ninety-eight
percent black. I have interacted
with white people forthe first time,

and it was not as bad as I thought it
would be — eventhough it has not
been perfect.

Ihave gone out with people of
all nationalities and learned the
beauty behind some of their be-
liefs. Ihave even left myself open
to major critizism by writing about
a story from two opposite view-
points. In other words, I have
given myself the opportunity to
have a complete education. I now
have the ability to see different
points of view.

Just remember: “If it doesn’t
kill you, it will only make you
stronger.” If you need any help
branching out, my assistance is
available until graduation. My
number is 6827, and I live in Flowe
103. If you truly want to learn,
experience is the best teacher

Campaign.
form and reform

SGA candidates are only al-
lowed to spend $15 dollars on their
campaigns. To some this is a rea-
sonable amount; for others like my

friend it is about $5 too much.
“You can make 100 fliers for $5,”

he complained, “that’s more than
enough.” He immediately
amended himself, however: “Oh
well, I guess they have to spend
another $5 on tape. But that’s the
absolute ceiling.” I reminded him
that the other $5 probably went
toward spray paint to create the
campaign rags that flutter outside
the dorms. Buthe got me thinking,

are our campaign regulations per-’

fect? Certainly not. They do not
address at least four areas of cam-

paigning which have come to light
during this last, week of political
activity.

1) NO e-mail. Mass mailings

seeking political support not only
turn off voters, it gives people false

hope.

2) One campaign slogan.
Multiple campaign slogans only
becloud and muddy the politcal
waters.

3) One celebrity endorse-
ment. Candidates ought to spend
as much time, if not more, solicit-
ing the support of the students as
the rich and famous.

4) One theme song. Just like
campaign slogans, more than one
theme song becomes confusing.

Spitting on our soldier’s graves

With the 50th anniversary of
many famous events in World War
II, a great deal of controversy has
risen. In our age of political cor-
rectness and victimization philoso-
phies many people have con-
demned the U.S. for some of its
actions in the war. There has also
been a large push in the U.S. when
it commemorates those who fought
and died to save the world to keep
from offending any of the coun-
tries which started the war.

I have always been interested
in WWIlandhave read many books
on it (especially the Pacific con-
flict) by both Japanese and Ameri-
can authors. I have a great respect
for the Japanese and do not want
anyone to consider my position
xenophobic. There are many traits
of Japanese culture which I wish
were present in American society.
The Japanese people and culture
are not bad, but the government
which led and represented them
during WWII was.

I have thought about writing
this article fora while, but I read an
article in the paper this morning
which has convinced me of its ne-
cessity. When the President and
top officials remember and com-
memorate the end of the war this
summer, they will not refer to that
famous, and to many sacred, day
when the Japanese surrendered as
“V-J Day” (Victory over Japan
Day). Instead it will be dubbed the
“End of the War Day.” Why this
change after 50 years? Because
we are afraid of offending the Japa-
nese. Did people forget what hap-
pened? Japan started the war by
bombing Pearl Harbor on a Sun-
day morning when our boys were
in church or asleep. At that time
we were not even at war with Ja-
pan. Do people forget the Baaton

Death March? Do people forget.

the thousands and thousands of
American men who died to stop
Japan from taking over the Pacific
and Eastern Asia? By changing

the name of V-J Day in order to
keep from upsetting the Japanese,
our government is spitting on the
graves of Americans who died de-
fending our nation.

The other big conflict and clas-
sic P.C. whining ground is the drop-
ping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. People now call
this the “second Holocaust of the
war” and “America’s greatest mis-
take.” The “in” thing is to show
pictures of children who were
burned by radioactive fallout and
talk about all of the Japanese people
killed by the bomb. Japan is even
asking for an American apology
for this “atrocity.” I will grant that
pictures of ground zero and of the
people affected by the bombs are
horrifying and, as opponents of the
discission point out, “resemble
what hell might lodk like.” But
war is hell. If the Japanese did not
want these things to happen, they
should not have started the war.

The people who show the pic-

tures of the bombing always seem
to omit certain other pictures from
their lists of the consequences of
dropping the bomb. They seem to
forget to put in the picture of a
Japanese officer running his sword
through a Chinese baby as its
mother watched. They leave out
the picture of Japanese soldiers
beheading the men in villages
which opposed themas their wives
watched. They forget to mention
the thousands of Chinese women
who were raped by Japanese sol-
diers.

They don’t show the pictures
of the Japanese torturing and ex-
ecuting American prisoners of war.
And they never show the crying
American mother whois just about
to tell her children that Daddy will
never come home. Those were the
images that Truman and our gen-
erals saw. Those were the scenes
they wanted to stop when they
dropped the bomb. There is dis-
pute over whether we would have

lost 600,000 or 400,000 or possi-
bly even only 200,000 men had we
invaded Japan. That doesn’t mat-
ter. Even the smallest numbers,
which greatly underestimate the
defenses and mentality of the Japa-
nese, would justify the bomb. Our
government’s responsibility was
to return as many of its troops to
their families as quickly as pos-
sible. If that meant killing some of
the enemy (who started the war) in
the process, then that was an un-
fortunate consequence.

What we did in WWII was
necessary to save the world from
expansionist powers and to save
American lives. We should be
proud of our forces. In the same
way that the Holocaust and Nazi
Germany should always be remem-
bered, so too should the Imperial
Japan of WWII. We owe it to
posterity to remember. But most
of all, we owe it to the brave young
men who died defending democ-
racy and our country.
