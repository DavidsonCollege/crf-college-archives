How does Admissions
recruit African American

students?

By Mary CLare JALONICK
Editor Emerita

The Admissions office recenly
sent out acceptance letters, and the
number of African American stu-
dents accepted is higher than ever.

The Minority

Experience at
Davidson

This year 206 African Ameri-
can students applied and 74 were
accepted. ‘This is a marked increase
from last year, when 130 applied
and 52 were accepted.

Senior Associate Dean of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid
Leonard Satterwhite says this class
is amilestone. “This is the firsttime
we have had more than 200 appli-
cants,” he says.

Dean of Admissions Nancy
Cable attributes the increase to a
concerted effort on the part of staff

torecruit African amege icans, Asian

Americans.

“What we’ ve found is that you
need to start working early,” she
says.

In order to increase the number.
of minority applicants, the admis-
sions office buys lists of names of
promising ninth grade students from
the College Board.

By the tenth grade, the students
receive mailings.

Beginning in the spring of the
junior year, the high school stu-
dents receive calls from minority
Davidson students — Cable calls it
a “massive phone campaign.”

The Admissions office then
calls or writes all minority recruits

in the fall of their senior year and

office has “involved current stu-
dents alot more” this year. In addi-
tion to the phonathons, current stu-
dents visit their old schools. Alumni,
as well, conduct local interviews
for recommendations.

Ann Jenkins, one of the 14
African American members of the
class of ’96 and now an admissions
counselor, says that the process is
rigorous. “I volunteered [with re-
cruiting efforts] throughout my four
years here, and it is a very compli-
cated process. It’s not as simple as
I thought.”

Last year, the Admissions of-
ficerecruited 2,741 African Ameri-
can students and 208, or 7% of
recruits, applied. Thirteen percent
of the total number of students re-
cruited applied.

Cable is optimistic about the —

progress that Davidson has seen.
“Tt takes about six to eight years to
build a stronger applicant base,”
she says.

Satterwhite, who directs most
minority recruitment, is also satis-
fied with the increases in numbers.

of progress,” he says. “We have
focused on the idea that we would
like a more diverse college. The
idea is to make the pool larger in
terms of applicants.”

However, he says, the school
has not made as much progress with
the numbers of Asian American or
Hispanic students.

“[Applicants are thinking], ‘Is
this school a reflection of me and
who I would like to be?’ At other
schools there might be more places
that students feel included. Efforts
are being made here, but there is
still progress to be made,” he says.

Tuition Benefit Proposal
Faculty make final
comments before
Trustee decision

By MATTHEW Eiricu
Associate Editor

At the final open forum on pro-
posed cuts to the dependent tuition
benefit last Monday, faculty mem-
bers questioned the wisdom and
economics of cutting the benefit.

Associate Professor of Eco-
nomics Vikram Kumar made the
most fundamental challenge to the
proposal when he asked President
John Kuykendall not to present the
proposal put forth by the Advisory
Council for Finance, Personnel and
Developmentto the College’s Board
of Trustees, Kumar acknowledged
the council’s work as laudable but
said that the issue was too complex
for them to handle adequately .

He said the proposal merely
duplicated other institutions’ ben-
efit plans, and that with more time a
more creative solution might be
found. The council’s proposal re-
flects a “rule of thumb: do unto
ourselves as others do unto them-

selves,” according to Kumar,

and Classics Peter Krentz suggested
that tuition benefits be decreased

Baseball knocks off league-leading Western

By MicHakEL Kruse

Sports Editor

The baseball team literally
walked to an upset win over West-
ern Carolina Sunday in Cullowhee,
taking advantage of Catamount
pitchers’ control problems to sal-
vage a victory in this weekend’s
three-game set.

“They’re a very good club,”
said seventh-year coach Dick
Cooke. “They’re a solid team of-
fensively, but they struggled on the
mound (yesterday). We got some
big hits and were able to take ad-
vantage.”

Seven Western pitchers com-
bined to issue 13 free passes and hit
three Wildcats in the three-hour,
18-minute marathon, as the Cata-
mounts collected 14 hits — four of
which were home runs — but ulti-
mately fell, 11-9.

Second baseman Jeff Coker,
who came into the series batting at
a.533 clip over his past four games,
launched a three-run homer in the
fourth inning, staking Davidson to
an early 5-1 advantage.

Mike DeSimone—whousually
does his damage from the pitching
rubber—knocked a two-run double
in the sixth inning to put the Wild-
cats up for good, 8-6. Both
baserunners who scored had been
walked.

Shortstop Ben Brown had two
hits, powerful center fielder Luke
Goodwin added two RBIs, and
pitcher Mordecai Stolk survived
Western’s offensive onslaught to
post his fourth win of the year.

Whata difference a day makes,
though. Western’s pitching over-
whelmed Davidson (18-24, 8-12
SC) Saturday, as the Wildcats man-
aged just eight hits total in the
doubleheader, losing 11-1 and 9-4.

Mike DiFelice pitched a com-
plete game, two-hitter in the opener,
pushing his record against South-
ern Conference opponents to 5-0.

Brad Edwards and Brown had
the only hits for the Wildcats, who
scored their one run in the first
inning on two walks, a wild pitch,
and a Sacrifice fly by Gus
Quattlebaum.

But the Catamounts (31-16-1,

15-6), one of the league’s premier
teams and winners of 14 of their last
18, had more than enough offense,
pounding out 11 runs on 18 hits.

“They’re going to get ten to 12
hits every ballgame,” Cooke ex-
plained. “And we did not have
many hits at all [Saturday].” ‘

Western outfielder Matt
Stillwell, who is hitting .411, had
three hits, including his 12th round
tripper of the spring, and third
baseman Jeremy Bruce went 3-for-
5.

The nightcap brought much of
the same woes for the Wildcats,
although their bats perked up some-
what. Brown had a pair of hits and
Quattlebaum smacked a two-run
homer in the seventh, accounting
for the only Wildcat extra-base hit
of the game.

Edwards went one for two and
scored twice, and DeSimone picked
up a base hit in a pinch-hitting role
in his only plate appearance.

The Wildcats venture into ACC
country this week, playing at N.C.
State Tuesday and at Duke Wednes-
