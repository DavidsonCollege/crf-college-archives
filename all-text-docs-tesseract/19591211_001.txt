Student Suggestions

By BOB MOORE

naging Editor

After a two-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon, the

ay.., Faculty reaffirmed the rule with reference to the pos-

session and use of alcoholic beverages. The rule is stated
under Item four on page twenty in the Red Book of Fac-

ulty Regulations for Students.

Item four states:

Davidson ColJlege is op-
posed ‘as a matter of principle
to the use of alcoholic bev-
erages by students. A student
wijl be suspended if he is
found guilty of drinking,
possessing or being under the
influence of an alcoholic bev-
erage while within the town
limits of Davidson or while
attending any off-campus
event sponsored entirely or
in part by Davidson College.

mittee niade the proposal that

IMPLICATION

‘The Committee stated that it
had been .generally assumed by
implication that the second
pledge permitted drinking at
after-dance parties. Several of
the fraternity presidents said
that they had been hesitant to
sign the pledge. because of the
existing inconsistency of Item
four in the Red Book and the
second pledge. .
