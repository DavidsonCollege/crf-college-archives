Beth Henley’s
newest play
fails to live up
to expectations

By KATHARINE LAIDLAW
Staff Writer

Charlotte Repertory The-
ater advertised their production
of Beth Henley’s new play Sig-
nature as an “off-beat comic
love story,” and I suppose that
description would be fitting to
atheater-goer who can still find
humor in the old Socrates joke:
“T drank what?”

Unless biting social satire
makes you giddy or you enjoy
playing voyeur into the lives of
less-than-human characters
unworthy even of disdainful
pity, I suggest you stay clear of
the Booth Theater until April 9,
when Henley’s play will close.

Signature is set in Los An-
geles in the year 2052, and as
with every Back to the Future
film and cheap sci-fi projection
of what will become of our
world, Henley has created an
environment thoroughly satu-
rated with technology which
has crippled the humanity of
those she depicts.

Though there are moments
in which these “creatures” of
her “strange, horrifying... sadly
silly world” lucidly portray
emotions with which we can
empathize, their words are con-
stantly entangled in futuristic
jargon: references to inven-
tions that have yet to be created
and fads which have yet to be
born.

For the audience, these
references both confuse and
alienate. While this effect is
perhaps inevitable in a “future”
piece, Henley has gone too far.
Aftera while, one wants to stand
up and scream at the stage: “I
get the point! This world of
2052 is mechanical, sterile, and
barren of anything organic. But
if one of you calls something a
‘C-5 on the V-6,’ just one more
time, I’m going to cringe deep
within my seat and refuse to
listen to another word!”

Oddly enough, Signature
was the result of Henley’s at-

tempt to create a contemporary
drama which would deal with
social issues.

But as director Steve
Umberger showed, the only
way Henley could get at what
she was striving for was to
project these conflicts into the
future and then relate them back
to the present.

Dreaming of Home

Departments collaborate in a unique

By EmiLy SIMMONS
Staff writer

In a menage of poetry and
music, Friday evening’s Dream-
ing of Home, A Cross-Cultural
Collaborative Performance of
Music and Poetry proved to be
both stirring and enlightening. It
presented a series of music and
poems from various cultures that
many people at Davidson may not
have been familiar with previously.

The program was centered
around five cankam poems of the
Tamils of ancient India. The Tamils
separated the world into five re-
gions suitable for humans — the
mountains, the scrub jungle, the
arid region, the riverine plains, and
the seacoast — and the cankam
poetry celebrated the life of the
people of each of these regions.
Each of the five cankam poems
performed in this show represented
these eco-regions and was set to
music known as pan-s. Each re-
gion had its own type of pan-s
music.

Nirmal Selvamony, a visiting
scholar at Davidson and instructor
in English and Tamil Musicology
at Madras Christian College in
South India, set the poems to this

Candyman Il, Farewell to Taste

New horror flick is a hit — right to the srOHn

By GEORDIE SCHIMMEL

Staff writer

Attila the Hun would stitch
his prisoners into the hollowed-
out carcasses of horses ,and even-
tually the maggots and the swelter-
ing heat would kill them. It is very
difficult to decide whether that is a
worse fate than suffering the inter-
minable two hours of Candyman
II, Farewell to the Flesh,

The movie opens with a pur-
ported Cambridge scholar receiv-
ing, amid an agony of histrionic
sputters and gasps, an iron hook
through the spleen. As he expires
in a pool of scribbled blood, the
mood is cast — the name is called,
the invocation is uttered — and
you are in Candyman II. (The
directorial intention here is most
likely unmitigated terror. One finds
that this intention laughably fails.)

As faras the movie goes, char-
acter development is at a standstill.
Lines are completely contrived.
Plot, in an extraordinary display of
obtuseness, unravels like a ball of
greasy yarn swiped by arabid tom-
cat. Annie, played by Kelly Rowan,
teaches art to a handful of degener-
ate hoodlums. All are afraid (for
reasons unknown) that the
Candyman, aslave tragically sepa-
rated from his love years ago, is
alive, real, and coming to get them.
To allay their fears, the teacher
says to her reflection in a mirror —
for that is how it is done — the
name “Candyman” five times.

Of course the: Candyman
(played by Tony Todd) is alive,
real, and now coming to get them.
This is the story. The screenwriter
has tossed in a few infirm subplots
to enliven the movie, such as
Anne’s discovering that the
Candyman is actually her great-
great-grandfather, or that she is to
bear a child by her Candyman-
slain boyfriend, but the story line
essentially consists of Anne’s es-
caping the bad guy. (With all the
hereditary links, the directorial in-
tention here is most likely supreme
irony. One does well not to hurl
rotten vegetables at the screen.)

To anyone left wondering
whether theatrical talent might still
be necessary in this age of the fast
flick, Candyman II vociferously
replies "NO!" No, theatrical talent
obviously is acommodity lost to at
least a handful of today’s actors.
And to anyone baffled by the in-
congrudus developments in the plot
— again, plot is here a generous
word — radio DJ (they’re reach-
ing forroles now) Kingfish’ s voice-
over resolves all doubt. Or ought
to. One sees immediately that’s
what was intended. Of course,
that’s not at all what happens. The
voice-over is a freakish, spectral
Thomas Hardy/Hamlet affair
which seems more like a drunken
digression than a plot resolution.

One of Kingfish’s unfortunate
lines, “Farewell to the Flesh,” per-
haps ought to read “Farewell to the
script.” As four tired people

Tony Todd offers Kelly Rowan some candy.

shuffled out of the movie, the poor
scriptcould be seen fluttering away
against the glaring neon — cough-
ing up phlegm, nearly dead, drib-
bling blood from a hook slash
somewhere near its kidney, and
terribly, terribly embarrassed.
However, in spite of its sheer
stupidity, the movie pricks the
brain, gets the mental gears turn-
ing. Where else, the starved mind
asks, can one could spend four-
fifty? Mine made its reply: buy
three cups of scalding coffee from

McDonald’s and pourthem on your
crotch (you know, for fun), smear
3/4 pound of week-old German
sausage on your cheeks and at-
tempt to pass for a signal reflector
(also quite a thrill), or perhaps, to
those more daring, watch the movie
again. (Joke not intended to be
taken seriously.)

See Candyman II at your own
risk. It is not worth the time. Re-
member, as you tender your cash
