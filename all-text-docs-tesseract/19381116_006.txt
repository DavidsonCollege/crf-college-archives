Lyon Teaches

Cats To “Marx” Up Victory Over Deacons

Faith Lesson

Compares Intellectual Knowl-
edge and Faith

Last Sunday morning Dr. C. S.

Lyon conducted Sunday School in

Phi Hall on the comparison be-
tween intellectual knowledge: and
Faith. He took his text from the

eleventh chapter of Hebrews. |
Dr. Lyon stated that in the in-

tellectual atmosphere of college, |
one is apt to believe .only that}
which can be proved; this will |
leave out Religion. He then brought |
out the point that so much of life
is yet uncertain. Life may be com-
pared with a lighted room. sur-|
rounded on all sides with darkness. |
“We know not from whence we]!
come, we know not from whence
we go,” stated Dr. Lyons
There are three reasons why we
believe in certain facts: First. we
believe in truths because we make
observations; second, because of
the testimony of others; and third,
because of the inductive and de-
ductive reasoning powers of the
human mind. The second two rea-
sons are both secondary to the
first. |
Dr. Lyons then asked the ques-|
tion as to whether it is justifiable :
to accept knowledge from the in-}
accurate sources of the human |
eye. There are many axioms and
transendental facts; such as mat-|
ter, time, energy, space and _ life,
that are accepted by intellectualists
purely on faith. Many scientists |
think all intellectual knowledge fail

The Sig Eps had previously beat-

to Casali, nice

ball, was the deciding factor. The
Sig Eps had three first downs to
