Davis Lecture

Rennie Davis, one of the
notorious Chicago Seven,
has. been contracted by the
SGA to speak on the David-
son campus March 1.

SGA President Ran Coble
said, ‘‘He’s inflammatory
and anti-estblishment, which
is something this campus
has never seen. From what
I understand, he’s one of
the more articulate of the
Chicago Seven. We want
somebody from that genre

_So that the speakers the SGA

has sponsored this year will
compose a balanced pro-
gram.” ;

Coble remarked that get-
ting speakers is always a
haphazard task, and that
this case was no exception.
A former Davidson student
Tom Thompson contacted
Davis iast summer and
wanted him: to come to Da-
vidson to speak. Thompson
got in touch with Coble soon

“after and attempts to get

Davis began early in the

school year.

Queens students aware of
the potential of the Ameri-

“Also, we hope that it will
make each woman more a-
ware of her own potential
and of the discrimination
that she must overcome be-

‘cause of her womanhood.”

Hodges pointed out that
the symposium actually has
a very broad focus. ‘‘Con-
trary to popular belief it is
not a symposium on Wo-
men’s lib, per se. We want
to expose the potential of
the American. woman and
make the girls around here
more aware. of their own
potential. Koontz and Mil-
lett simply represent various
facets of this potential.’’

A REVIEW

By SCOTT DAVIDSON

This week, the Hungry d
is featuring a slender gang-
ling country-folk singer call-
ed Townes Van Zandt. Spot-
lighted against the black
curtain backdrop’ of the
Union Bar. Van Zandt pre-
sents a small, intimite per-
forman¢é that is often quite
pleasant. Pleasant, but not
moving or exciting or stimu-
lating.

Most of his songs are, ap-
parently, his own (he did a
nice rendition of ‘‘John Wes-

the exception of a haunting
ballard called, ‘‘Nothing”’
they are undistinguished and
quickly forgotten.

The music can be lifting
and sweet, and often was
possesive of a rhythmic
throbbing that. propeled the
song comfortably through to
its conslusion.

But the lyrics were simple-
minded, poorly rhymed, and
soporific.-Yan Zandt seem-
ed to have attempted a fu-
sion of humor and profund-
ity, and achieved neither.

One of the work dropouts
was senior Jack Caldwell.
According to’ his brother,
sophomore Paul Caldwell,
Jack took three courses at
Georgia Tech last summer
to make up for the Winter
term absence, and left
school to work at the end of
the Fall term.

His brother Paul expects
him to return at the begin-
ning of the spring term, and
graduate with his class.
Friends of séniors Jeff
Brantley and Chris Bickley
Say they too will be back
later in the year.

The other student who
dropped out to work was
‘Marshall Case, a junior pre-
med major, who is now
working’ in a hospital in
Washington, D. C. Danny
Clodfelter, a former room-
mate, said that Case would
return to school in the Spring
term.

Of the five transferees,
four were freshmen who
were dissatisfied with Da-
vidson for various reasons.
Freshman Darrell Bailey
transferred to Oberlin Col-
lege in Oberlin, Ohio, in or-
der to, get ‘better music
courses for his music ma-
jor:

‘Freshman William Raman
transferred to the Universi-
ty of Texas at Austin to take
engineering courses which
he could not gét at David-
son. Two other freshmen,
Randy Stepp and Greg
Strong, transferred to
schools eloser to their

homes.

Junior Keith Lindloff, ac-
cording to his roommate,
transferred to the University

of Texas at ‘Austin ‘‘be-
cause his girlfriend lives
there."’

The six who left because
of a “‘loss of facademic mo-
tivation’ appear to have
hit the nail on the head.
Among this group were two
seniors, two sophomores, a
junior, and a freshman.

The freshman .was Jack
Parker, who, according to a
hallmate, was hospitalized

‘early in the term, got be-

hind in his courses, cut
them a great deal when he
came back, and dropped
out before the end of the
term. The hallmate recalled
that he was very apathetic
about Davidson in general.

The junior who lost his
“motivation” was Ovid: Bai-
ley, Darrell's brother.
Friends of Baley recall that
he just wanted to “get away”
for a while.

No information is avail-
able on. the attrition: rate
for past years. The Dean of
Students’ Office, the Office
of Admissions and Financial
Aid, the Academic Vice-
President's Office, and the
Registrar's Office denied
any profile or tabulation of
Students in past years who
have dropped out of David-
son:

“I've only been in this of-
fice for three weeks,”’ said
‘Dean of Students William
H. Terry.

What resulted were lines
like, “‘Heaven ‘ain’t bad, but
you don’t get things done,”
and, ‘Went back to the
house in about an_ hour,
everybody drinking whiskey
sours."’

Van Zandt’s running pat-
ter between songs didn’t
transcend his material. He
clinched a ‘long, drawn-out
narrative of a weekend
drunk with, ‘It would have
been embarrassing if I
hadn’t passed out.” That
was the funny. line. Or he
provides background for
songs by explaining that
they were written in an eco-
nomics class, or with his pet
fly (‘ta wierd fly’’).

Despite his shortcomings,
Van Zandt still has a nice
musical style. His voice is
mellow and soothing; his
manner is quiet and _ sub-
dued. I would suspect that
this intimacy would be hope-
lessly drowned in the more
spacious surroundirigs of the
Morrison Room, where he
plays this weekend.

Townes Van Zandt does
not live up to the standards
of previous Hungry d_ per-
formers. But it is, neverthe-
less, a pleasant performance.
Pleasant, not moving or ex-
citing or stimulating.

system: will work out. Given
a freshman class which does
not come in as opinionated
on the fraternity question
and a senior class not as
torn by the issue as this
year’s, the new system can
work.”’

‘He acknowledged the fact
that it was going to be ex-
tremely difficult for © the
houses to survive off ¢am-
pus."’ Fraternities that
choose to move off campus
will be confronted by the
tremendous expenses of pro:
perty and house, compound:
ed .by the rising costs of
college.

“The groups now labeled
national fraternity, if they
remained on campus, could
maintain the same kind of
characteristics that their
houses take pride in with
a system of self-selection.”
