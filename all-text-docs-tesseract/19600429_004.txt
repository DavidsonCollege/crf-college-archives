At Davidson he has maintained

He served on the Honor Court.
He was president of Sigma Pi —

And recently he won one of
Davidson's eight Woodrow Wil-!
son Foundation grants for grad-
uate study—one of America’s
most coveted academic awards.

Modest Baggett doesn’t like to
inspire awe.

“I don’t like being some sort
of phenomenon,” he said in a
chapel program last fall. “I just] ;
want to be a normal blind boy.”!

AMAZES ALL

But the “normal blind boy”
can't help amazing everybody.

He once made a nerfect score
on a calculus exam, doing all
his figuring mentally!

He tutors sighted math stu-
dents, calculating faster mental-
Jy than his students can do on
paper.

He is an accomplished pianist,
with a talent ranging from jazz
to the classics.

He is a formidable bridge .
player, using cards with tiny
braille notations in the°corners. i

CHAPTER SELECTED bs | a 4

Baggett was selected by his
fraternity brothers to represent
the Davidson ATO chapter in z
the national competition; his ,
record then was compared to
reports on province winners
from all over America—and he| :
emerged the victor, topping
hopefuls from over one hundred
and twenty colleges and univer-|_
sities across America and Can-
ada.

Baggett’s victory made a rec-
ord: he’s the second Davidson
student to win the national
award in five years. In 1955,
