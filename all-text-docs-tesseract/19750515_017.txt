Professor Emeritus

I fear I’ve lost my touch with you (oh me)

my books. You sag in my hands like pizza dough.
So long you whirled! whizzing high, you kissed low
on fingertips, my phrases light and crusty
crumbled on their lips--they hummed like a bee
color-drunk. Now in the evening I’ll grow
flowers, that’s it, there in the weeds below

this window I can putter, sprouts I'll see.
Someone, sidewalking,. ves. might wander by:
will the colors perk their eve? could thev care
tolinger? ‘“‘coffee? I’ll bet a piece of pie...”’

Oh why havea chef’s secret not toshare?
Cookbooks don’t do cooking. There vou lie.

I fear I’ve thumbed you dry at last, oh mv

R. P.’s Sonnet

4 Sincere Poem

Eric Walker

You, R. P., are fat.

When I met you five years ago

You were afraid of your shadow
Afraid of the day

And you were white as the moon
And thin.

Now your laughter is honey.
Smooth.

Your future like you, well-endowed.

Only this: the worm is at work,
Your connection is cut.

You are as ice cold as sterility.
And then the fat melts away.
Drip drip drip.
