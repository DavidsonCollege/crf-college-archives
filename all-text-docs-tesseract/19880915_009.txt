Field Hockey

Wildcats whip Salem 11-0, lose to Duke 1-0

By LARRY DAGENHART, JR.

The word is control. That’s what the
Davidson field hockey team seems to be in
as the Cats improved to . ee
2-1 after an 11-0 blow-
out over Salem College
Tuesday.

The regular season -
began quite auspi-
ciously last Tuesday as
Davidson, for the first
time in many years, beat
Pfeiffer College 1-0.

Davidson generated
lots of offense and had
about the same number
of shots on goal as Pfeif-
fer did. However, Mary
Russ scored ‘the only
goal by rebounding a
goalie save with five
minutes left in the
game.

The Cats lapsed in the
final two minutes and
even allowed Pfeiffer a
penalty stroke, but co-

.captain goalie Alison
Chapman got-the team
back together. mentally and prevented what
could have been trouble.

Thursday, the Duke Blue Devils of the
ACC invaded Davidson for a rematch of

time Duke did not get away so easily,
winning only 1-0.

tor Was that Duke was playing its first game
of the season on grass, a surface practically
foreign to the Blue Devil players who play

cause of bouncy balls on the grass field.

ball around the

In Good Health

By MARK PUCKETT

Everyone wants to look
good. Men want muscles and
rippled stomachs--not love
handles and: beer bellies.

.. Women want lithe, toned bod-
ies--not cellulite deposits on
their fundaments.

No one is proud of being
unfit. Why, then, do people get
fat? Most people eat too much
of the wrong foods and exer-
cise too little. If you read last
week’s column, you will know

_ that eating the right foods
. combined with regular exer-
‘cise yields fitness and good
health.

But you hate to exercise.
And you are going to eat what-
ever you want. I can’t make
you change your lifestyle; I
can only tell you why you
- ought to change it. I offer the
following information for your
benefit. It has helped me.

Fitness Tips of the Week
1. Analyze what you eat. Think
about what you are putting into
your body. Read the labels on
boxes and cans. It helps to
know protein, vitamin, fat, car-
bohydrate, sugar, sodium, cho-
lesterol, and fiber content.
Avoid fried foods especially.
"2. Don’t just eat for the sake of
eating. Be sensible about what
- your body is telling you. If you
feel full, quit eating.
3. Exercise in the morning
~ (before noon)--about two
~ hours after you wakeup. Your

How to exercise

body will respond better. You get
it over with and don’t have to
worry about it for the rest of the
day.

“4. Eat a piece of fruit about an

hour before you workout. It will
give you good, quick energy as

’ ‘opposed to the energy you get

from eating a candy bar. Eat fruit
after a. workout as well--it will
replenish lost carbohydrates and
raise your glycogen level.

5: When. working out, practice
proper techniques--especially in
weight training. You aren’t in the
weight room to impress your
buddies by throwing as much

weight on the bar as you can and

doing acouple of improper repeti-
tions. Concentrate on the muscles
you are working. Try not to rest
more than a minute between sets,
even if it means reducing the
amount of weight you are ‘work-
ing with.

6. If you exercise aerobically, do
‘it at least three times a week for
20-25 minutes. If, at first, you can
only exercise once or twice a
week--don’t worry. Eventually
you will.want to exercise and,

‘ thus, find more time for it in your

schedule.

7. Eat a light breakfast, Harvey
and Marilyn Diamond in Fit for
Life say ,““From the time you wake
up... until at least noon, consume
nothing but fruit and fruit juices .
. . as much as you want. You will
be able to create, not burn up, a
huge chunk of your available
energy for the day.”

8. The weight room is not a social

and eat

club--it’s for exercising. So-
cialize after your workout. ©
9, Eat your vegetables.

10. Gradually increase your
fiber intake. Eat salads, fruits,
vegetables, _ whole-grain
breads and cereals, etc. Fiber
helps lower cholesterol.

11. Warm up and warm down.
Stretch before and after a
workout.

12. Don’t limit yourself to one
type of exercise. If you get
bored of swimming, try run-

ning or lifting weights. Give it

a good run, but if you don’t
enjoy what you’ re doing; don’t
do it.

13. Most importantly--estab-
lish aroutine. Get involved ina’
program and stick with it.

You have two choices: 1)
stay unhealthy and risk dying
at an early age because your
fat-clogged arteries couldn’t
handle your lack of exercise.
and poor, eating habits, or 2) be
healthy and flourish asafitness
deity. The choice is yours.

For those serious about get-
ting fit, I recommend the book,

Fit for Life, by Harvey and |

Marilyn Diamond. American
Health, Men's Fitness, Flex,
and Shape, as well as other
magazines, offer updated

health and fitness information

that is useful.

standing game.

Davidson, on the other hand, only had six
shots on goal for the day.

Pryor was pleased, nevertheless. “Last
year we didn’t get any shots in the circle,
and: this time we had, more attack at
midfield.”

Another factor Pryor mentioned was the
level of fan contribution at the game. The
good turnout of students and their noise re-
ally helped the Cats intensify after Duke
scored.

On Tuesday, Davidson put on a scoring
clinic, as the Wildcats pounded Salem Col-
lege 11-0. Lauren Follmer led all scoring
with 4 goals, two of which came in the first
five minutes.

Gigi. Cooke, Katherine Mallory, and
Mary Russ all had goals in the first half, as
Davidson went up 6-0.

The most interesting goal came in the
second half when Follmer shot from the far
right and the ball was tapped back into the
goal by a Salem defender.

Salem’s inexperience showed most of
the game. Davidson outshot them 47-7.
Four of Salem’s shots were saved by
backup goalie Tracey Perez, who came in
to relieve Chapman in the second half.

Davidson’s next game is at High Point
College on the'19th; the next home game is
September 27 against Pfeiffer.

Thought of the Week” coming next week.
