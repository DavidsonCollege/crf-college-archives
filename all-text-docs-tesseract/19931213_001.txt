The shape of things to come? The possible future

By Wendy Lee ©

Thought about what the Davidson
campus might look likein years tocome?
The Environmental Consulting Services
Limited of Toronto has.

The consultants recently presented
a “Master Plan” for the college which
the Trustees approved at their October
meeting. The plan proposes guidelines
for making changes in campus facilities.

The plan specified three goals for
the college: to meet the needs of faculty,
staff, and students; to distribute resources
equally; and to keep costs as manage-

able as possible. ;

A few interesting facts were pre-
sented in the plan.

Anumber of 8,650 cars per day pass
by the Visual Arts Center on Griffith
Street. Space for teaching and faculty
Offices totals 253,000 square feet with

172 square feet per student. .

Dr. John Kelton, chairman of the
facilities planning committee, said “The
study concludes that we are in pretty
decent shape in terms of building space,
but that some of the space we have isn’t

adapted well to the functions it’s used

for.”

Currently there are 17 buildings
used for Administrative purposes. The
plan suggests that these be consolidated.
It also suggests that computer services
be merged.

High priority would be placed upon
uniting Baker Sports Complex with the
rest of campus. The plan cited space
constrictions for the psychology, music,
theater, and biology departments and
for computer services, registrar, and stu-
dent services as major points of empha-
sis.

Among the “growth” scenarios sug-
gested are: additional buildings between
Chambers and E.H. Little Library; addi-
tions to the library, the Dana and Martin
Science Buildings, and Cunningham Fine
Arts Building. :

The plan recommended that studios
and performance areas be set aside for
the theater and music department. It also
advises that there be a minimum number
of internal roads in the campus.

Among the 57 recommendations
made in the “Master Plan” include:

¢ The main pathways of campus
should be maintained and enlarged to
better integrate areas of campus like
Baker.

¢ The shortages of space for psy-
chology, music, theater and biology

Search is on
for new Dean
of Students

By Lexy DeVane
A joint committee of students
and faculty has been working in
the selection process for a new

Dean of Students:.-The new dean.

will follow Will Terry who is to
retire this spring after 23 years.

This committee, headed by Dr.
Bruce Jackson, has been meeting
about once a week since its forma-
tion in early October.

Members of the committee,
representing a cross-section of the
college community, were asked by
the president to participate.

Students on the committee
include juniors Sarah Orsbon and
Eric Rosenbach, and seniors Julie
Petty and DeVane Tidwell. Fac-
ulty membersinclude Vivien Dietz,
history and humanities; Bruce
Jackson, mathematics; Julio
Ramirez, psychology; Janet Shan-
non, sociology; other members in-
clude men's tennis coach Jeff Frank
and Assistant Director of the An-
nual Fund Lisa Combs.

Currently, the committee is
busy sorting through numerous
applications. Two advertisements
in national academic journals for
this job have been placed, increas-
ing the diversity of applicants
greatly. A consulting agency has
also been utilized for prospective
applicants and background checks.

The deadline for applications
is January 15, assuring the com-
mittee plenty of time for inter-
viewing selected candidates. The
committee will then submit their
recommendations to the president
before the April meeting of the
Trustees. Although much of the
committee work has been kept pri-
vate, a member wished to stress
that “the committee wants the best
qualified candidate. Ideally, the
future Dean will have had experi-
ence with a small liberal arts col-
lege and will also be proficient in
the skills necessary for being the
Vice President of Student Life.”

McMillen featured in New South Museum

By Sally Stone

It is fitting that Charlotte’s
New South museum is located
within the city's largest monument
to progress, the NationsBank
tower. The intimate museum is in
Founders Hall, a wing of Nations-
Bank, site of the Blumenthal Per-
forming Arts Center.

Currently showing at the New
South museum is the exhibit,
“When Southern Women Went to
College.” This hall-long exhibit
includes an interactive video pro-
gram about the New South. Dr.
Sally McMillen, Davidson profes-
sor of history, is featured in the
video discussing the influence of
women on the New South.

The New South is defined as
the transition from growing cotton
to turning cotton into textiles, ac-
cording to former Queens profes-
sor Bari Watkins. The current ex-
hibit focuses on women’s integra-
tion into Southern institutions from
1880-1930. _

“When Southern Women
Went to College” was compiled by
Queens College and features in-
formation about Queens,
Livingston College, and Winthrop
University’s coeducation.’ It in-
cludes information on the curricu-
lum, regulations for female stu-
dents, athletics, and activities.

The first panel begins the ex-
hibit with the statement, “When
southern women went to college
they left their homes and families
for a promise of higher education.
They arrived as daughters with a

thirst for knowledge and they left:

as educated women.”

Several panels detail unique
aspects of women’s experiences.
For example, female students were
required to be escorted by elders
when leaving campus, The ratio-
nale administrators gave for strict
regulations was that “women had
to prove that they could be schol-
arly and feminine at the same time.”

Se ee ee Women’s educational integra-__

tion extended beyond the South
also. Lucille Godbold, a Winthrop
student, set the international
women’s shotput record in Paris in
1922. After tracing the evolution
of female students through en-

larged and yearbook photos, the.

exhibit concludes, “When South-

_ erm women left college they set out

to change the world and they did.
Without educated new women
there could not be a New South.”

College debates
newest proposal
for Statement

of Purpose
By Rachel Dunifon

What is Davidson’s philoso-
phy? What are its goals and how
are they achieved? These are some
of the questions addressed by
Davidson’s Statement of Purpose.

Although this document may
not be familiar to many students,
campus-wide discussion has arisen
about ways to make it more repre-
sentative of the college. This was
the topic at a forum sponsored by
the SGA Wednesday night.

Initiative to modify the exist-
ing Statement of Purpose came
last year from several students and
faculty members. They felt that its
emphasis on “Christian higher edu-
cation” does not represent the cur-
rent make-up of the college.

Additionally, a large self-
study of the entire school, occur-
ring next year, requires the re-
evaluation of all of Davidson’s
current documents.

The Statement of Purpose can
only be changed by Davidson’s
Board of Trustees. Craig Wall,
Chair of the Board, appointed a
committee last spring to review
the document. Larry Daggenhart
and William Wood represent the
Trustees on the committee, while
Alexander McKelway and Ben-
