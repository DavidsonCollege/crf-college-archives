TRACK TEAM
BEGINS PRACTICE

A good many men have joined the
track squad and Coach Kluttz has been
giving them a light workout each after-
noon. The work of rebuilding the old
track has been pushed during the pasc
week, and it is now in much better con-
dition.

Davidson will be especially well rep-
resented in the dashes and long distance
runs. Captain Morrison, Ives, Matti-
son, M. McKinnon and Crouch are
showing up well in the dashes, and W.
A. Johnson, A. G. Finley and Brand
are good long distance men. In the
other departments some of the men who
show much promise are: Hurdles, Mc-
Alister and Worth; high jump, Perry.
W. B. Crouch, Boggs, McAlister and
Poole; pole vault, Perrv, Boggs, Brand
and W. B. Crouch. In the weight
events Grav. Poole and Knight should
make good men. [It is too early to make
predictions as to. the particular sfars, but
with the wealth of material already out
Davidson should have at least three good
men in every event,

DR. GURNEY SPEAKS AT
Y. M. C. A. MEETING

Dr. H. E. Gurney, pastor of the Pres-
byterian church at Monroe, spoke to the
Y.M. C. A. on Thursday night, taking
as his subject, “The Spiritual Birth.”
He chose as his text John 3:6, “Phat
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and
that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”
Dr. Gurney divided the whole race of
mankind into two classes: the unregen-
erate, and the regenerate. The unregen-
erate class experience one birth, the phy-
sical birth, and two deaths, the physical
and the spiritual. On the other hand
the regenerate class experience the nat-
ural birth and also the spiritual birth.
but only one death, which is the natural
death. It is the spiritual birth by which
we pass from death to life. Sin, said the
speaker, is a separation from God, while
conversion is a change whereby we draw
ourselves back toward God. The spirit-
ual birth, or conversion, comes by two
means: first, a regeneration in the man;
second, by the working of the Spirit in
him.

NEW FRATERNITY HALLS.

In accordance with the regulation
that all fraternity halls must be removed
from Chambers building, work on the
new halls is being rushed, in order to
complete them before commencement.
The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity will oc-
cupy one-half of Elm Row. The partition
between two rooms will be removed,
leaving a spacious hall. The Beta Theta
Pi will occupy a portion of Oak Row,
while the mew Sigma Alpha Epsilon hall
will be on the first floor of the Eumen-
ean Society building, in what was for-
merly the old “D” room. The con-
tractors are rushing all these halls to
completion, and when finished they will
be beautiful and modern in every respect.
The new halls with the old ones will
form a “Fraternity quadrangle.”

VISIT OF EXPERT GOLFERS.

Monday afternoon the Davidson Golf
club was given the rare opportunity of
secing a really famous golfer in action.
Mr. Carl Anderson, professional con-
nected with Wright and Ditson Com-
pany, accompanied by Mr. Scott, of
Boston, played an eighteen hole match
with some local. players. Mr. Anderson
and Professor Woods as partners played
Dr. J. M. McConnell and J. W. Clark
in a foursome. After eighteen holes of
ragged but close golf, the match ended
two points in favor of the professional
and Professor Woods.

OUR NEXT GAMES.

The second base ball game of the
season will be played on the local field
tomorrow afternoon with Oak Ridge.
one of Davidson's old rivals. “The Oak
Ridge boys have always given the Dav-
idson lads a lively tussle, and have sev-
eral times gone away with the laurels.

The Red and Black will do all in
its power to get revenge for its defeat
two seasons ago.

The visitors come with a strong team
and one that has a number of last year's
veterans. In the opening game of the
season they won from the Carolina team,
which proves their worth.

There will probably be some changes
in tomorrow's line-up, in the light of the
Catawba game. The pitchers will prob-
ably be either Lawson or Hengeveld, as
Davidson will be called upon to put
forth her best material to come off vic-
torious.

The Red and Black team goes to
Charlotte Saturday for a game with
‘Wake Forest. The team is getting
into good shape and will go with the in-
tent of reaping vengeance for last year's
defeat. A lively game should be the
result.

DR. FULTON TO SPEAK
AT GASTONIA

On the evening of April 13th, Dr.

Fulton will lecture before the meeting |.

of the State Library Association, in Gas-
tonia. It will be an illustrated lecture
on “Shakespeare and Stratford,” showing
pictures of Shakespeare’s birthplace, the
Ann Hathaway cottage, the church in
which Shakespeare is buried, and many
other slides equally interesting. The
Shakespeare evening was planned in or-
der that the Association and the people
of Gastonia might share in the nation-
wide celebration of the Shakespeare ter-
centenary.
