NETHERLANDS CHAMBER CHOIR

A Cappella Choir

Sings Next Friday

The Artist Series will present the Netherlands
Chamber Choir under the direction of Felix De Nobel on
Friday, Feb. 16 at 8:15 p.m. The choir will perform in

Chambers auditorium.

The choir began by perform-
ing for radio broadcasts in 1937,
but within a short time they
were making concert .appear-
ances in Holland, and soon after
in all the leading cities of
Europe, having recently played
at festivals in Edinburgh. Bor-
deaux, ahd Vienna.

A cappella singing occupies
first place in the choir's activi-
ties. but it also performs with
orchestral, organ or piano ac-
companiment, with music rang-
ing from Palestrina to Stravin-
sky.

For their appearance here, the

choir will present works from
many historical periods and na-
tional traditions spanning five
centuries of music, with works
by such nofable composers as
Bull, Dresden, Mozart, and
Bruckner.

Dr. Plott, director of the Male
Chorus, commented that “the
Netherlands Chamber Choir is
one of the finest choruses of its

type in. the world.”

“They all have mature voices,”
he said. ‘and give a mellow
sound not found in a group of |

younger singers.”

ColdTemperatures Prompt
Excursions To Ski Resorts!ywca organizes

BY WILLIAM WALKER
Davidsonian Feature Writer
For about the past month, Davidson students have

been taking advantage of the cold weather to draw on the
resources of one of North Carolina’s ski resorts.

Dr. T. F. Clark of the Bible
Department, who led skiing ex-
cursions over the Christmas
holidays and the semester break,
described the expenses and fa-
cilities of the Green Briar ski
resort at Hot Springs.

“The resort at Hot Springs is
operated by the Homestead
Hotel,” said Clerk, “whose
cheapest rooms rent for $35.00
a day. Consequently, most stud-
ents who go there prefer to stay
at the nearby Cascades = inn
Motor Lodge, where you can
room for $10.00 a day with
breakfast, supper, and skiing
privileges included.”

Clark added that skiing privi-
leges at the resort cost about
$4.00 a day for {hose not stay-
ing at the motor lodge or hotel,
and that renting skis, boots, and
ski poles came to nearly an-
other $8 00..

Commenting on the resort's!

facilities, Clark said, “Hot
Springs has four ski routes; 2
beginner’s s‘ope and a higher

High prices and the six hour
drive from Davidson west to Hot |
Springs have evidently failed to
discourage ardent skiers. Five
enterprising Phi Delts even
managed to find an inn that
would let them cram into one
room and split the cost. A num-
ber of Sigma Chi’s, with superb
academic confidence, left the
campus for Hot Springs on Mon-
day and weren‘t expected back
till Thursday, and a third group
is planning @ pilgrimage to a
vesort at Waynesville.

There has even been rumor
of a movement to organize Col-
lege Union sponsored trips to
resorts, and Mr. S. Shaw Smith
has shown an interest in the
idea. What cffect this will have
on student group insurance poli-
‘cies and academic standirz will
remain to be seen.

Seven Will Atfend
Philosophy Meet

Alfred North Whitehead,
noted British philosopher, will
be the topic of discussion at

the sixth annua) Southern Philo- |

sophy Students convention, Feb.
17-18 at the University of Chat-
tanooga.

Representing Davidson at this
conference will be Price Cald-

‘well, Dave Dillard, Bill Ferris,

Tom Harris, Roger Laney, Frank

‘Mansell, and Dr. Earle Mac-

Cormac. Other participating
schools are.Agnes Scott, Emory,
and Sewanee. Davidson hosted
the conference in 1959.

In preparation for the con-

iference, weekly study groups

are being held Sunday nights
after vespers at. MacCormac's
house. Here students are dis-
cussing Whitehead’s Process and
Reality and Science and the
Modern World ‘which they have
previously read.

Whitehead, according to Mac-
Cormac, is “probably the most
important philosopher of our
century.” He is considered a
“process philosopher” who em-
phasizes “things becoming” in-
stead of “things being.”

Discussion Groups

The YMCA announced this
week the formation of two study
and discussion groups, which
will hold their first meetings
next week.

One group, led by Dr. J. O.
Embry, will discuss Existential-
ism, using as background ma-
terial No Exit and 3 Other Plays
by Sartre and The Existential
Posture by Shinn. This group
will hold its first meeting on
Wed., Feb. 14, at 4:30 p.m.

A second group, led by Val
Frakes, assistant to the chap
lain, will discuss Reinhold Nie-
buhr’s classic on the foundations
of democracy, The Children of
Light and the Children of Dark-
ness. The first meeting of this
group will be on Thurs., Feb. 15,
at 4:30 p.m.

Students interested in parti-
cipating
groups should sign up at the
YMCA office immediately.
Copies of the books to be used
are available in the Knovel
Knook

in Charlotte, Davidsonians meet

in either of these:

certain ends peacefully.

The Rev. Russell Montfort,
minister of the Methodist
Church, stated that various
groups and persons in the world
today are resorting to non-vio-
lent resistance as an alternative
to bloody revolutions. He cited
Mahatma Ghandi and Martin
Luther King as examples.

“We also feel that we should
consider the use of non-violent
resistance as a Christian alter-
native when law and conscience
disagree,” he added.

ANDREWS SPOKE FIRST

The first speaker in the series
was David Andrews, chaplain at
Appalachian State Teachers Col-
lege, who recently demonstrated
in front of the White House on
behalf of Martin Sobell, who is
imprisoned in connection with
the Rosenberg spy trials. An-

drews believes that Sobell is
innocent. While praying before
the White House, Andrews was
arrested for blocking the side-
walk.

NEGROES ON SIT-INS

The second program was pre-
sented earlier this evening by
two Johnson C. Smith students
and dealt with the sit-in move-
ments in connection with inte-
gration.

The final program of the ser.
ies will be on Fri., Feb. 23, fol-
lowing supper at the Methodist
Chureh. The speaker will be
Boyd Payton, a leader in the
North Carolina labor movement
who was involved in the Hen-
derson Mill strike of 1958. He
was subsequently arrested and
has just recently been released
from prison.

the Vagabonds will per-
“Androcles and the Lion” in the Cunning-
each beginning at 8:15 p.m.,

on Tuesday through Thursday nights, Feb. 27, 28, and Mar. 1.

Professor John Sneden, di-
rector of the Vagabonds, used
the words “overwhelming re-
sponse” in his pleasure and sur-
prise at the number of people
that came to witness the per-
formances of “Antigone.”

Sneden commented that at
least two-thirds of the specta-
tors were from outside David.
son. “Their desire to see the
new fine arts building might
have had something to do with
their coming,” he surmised,
“put we hope as many turn
out for “Androeles.”

In his efforts to obtain more
viewers, Sneden will maintain a
policy of the. past that is per-
haps not too well known. Tickets
for any group on or off campus
that contain fifteen or more
members will be only 50 cents

each. Tickets at the door will
continue to be 75 cents, as usual.

Sneden said that all but. two
female characters of his cast
have been obtained. Despite
announcements that there would
be “a cast of thousands,” Sned-
en confessed that in the end the
thousands have become only 27.
“But I could not get any more,
anyway, on that little stage,” he
said.

Mrs. Louise Hampton, wife
of Capt. David Hampton, will
take the role of Megaera,
Androcles’ wife. Androcles
will be played by Walter Bost,

Sneden Seeks Plays
To Present At Festival

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

He didn’t look like a professor standing there in the Vagabonds’ workshop in
paint-stained clothes. But John Sneden is a professor of dramatics and dramatic
literature. He is also director of the Vagabonds. And that is fitting, for he eats,

sleeps, lives, and even speaks drama for 24 hours a day.

- Even though he is wrapped up

right now with making’ props
and rehearsing the Vagabonds'
next play, Androcles and the
Lion, Sneden is still looking a-
head to what is to follow this
semester. Most of his time after
this month will be taken up with
preparing one act plays for
competition in the Carolina Dra-
matic Association’s district fes-
tival to be held in the Cunning-
ham Fine Arts Center here,
March 24. Sneden is the vice-
president of the association this
year.

‘Sneden is giving careful
consideration to the task of
picking representative plays.
By his own admission, good
one act pleys are hard to find.
Sneden is quite happy that
Davidson has been selected as
the site of the district competi-
tion. “It is a lot of work for me
to administrate “the various
groups who come,” he said. “But
I hope to get the district festi-

val back here next year.”

This will be a special year for

the Carolina Dramatic Associa-
tion Sneden explained as he
stood by the figure of the lion’s
mask that will be used in his
next play. “We are having our
fortieth anniversary celebration
in Chapel Hill, April 11-14. But
that fact will make the competi-
tion stiffer this year than it was
last.

“Since they will have a
dance, a banquet, and e good
many speakers this year, only
12 of the best plays in the
state will be chosen to be pre-
sented af Chapel! Hill. Since
only 12 can go from the whole
state, we will probably only
get to send one, if we send
any, this year.”

Davidson sent three plays to
Chapel Hill last year, with “The
Second Shepherd's Play” win-
ning the highest rating possible,
“distinguished.” The other two
won “excellent” ratings.

get to go to Chapel Hill. Each
district competition will have a
judge from the University of
North Carolina viewing the
plays. Sneden explained that the
judges would select the 12 plays
from the. best that they had
seen.

When asked if he planned
any other dramatic activity,
Sneden commented that he
would like to do fonesco’s
“The Bold Soprano.” “It only
requires three men and three
women to stage; so | am hop-
ing there will be enough in-
terest to put it on late in the
semester.”

He described the long, one
act play as an “anti-play,” com-
paring it to modern art. “It is
to the theater what modern art
is to painting.”

need of such an organization.

At this meeting it was also
announced that the college ig
going to complete five more
rooms in Richardson Dormitory
and also furnish one fairly large
room with a number of double-
deck beds.

These moves were made in
consideration of Davidson’s mov-
ing closer next year to her goal
of an enroliment of 1000 stud-
ents. The large single room
would be used only while regu-
lar rooms were being arranged
for the occupants. Its use would
