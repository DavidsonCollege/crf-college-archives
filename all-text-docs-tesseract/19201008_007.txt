THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER &, 1920.

= DR. W. W. MOORE HELD IN

HIGH ESTEEM THROUGH-
OUT SOUTHERN PRESBYTE-
RIAN CHURCH.

Davidson College Proud to Own
DOCTOR MOORE AS SON.

Rev. Walter William Moore, D.D.,
LL.D., for the past 16 years presi-
dent of Union Theological Seminary,
was born in Charlotte, N. C.. June
14, 1857,

He graduated from Davidson Col-
lege with the degree of Bachelor o
Arts in 1878, and took his theo-
logical course at Union Seminary in
the three years following, grad-
uating there in 1881. The degree of
Doctor of Divinity, was conferred
in 1885 by Central University of
Kentucky, and the degree of Doctor
of Laws was conferred in 1892 by
Davidson College. On August 30,
1881 he was ordained to the Preshy-
terian ministry, and during that
year and the year following was
evangelist in western North Caro-
lina. Then followed a pastorate at
Millersburg, Ky., in 1882-83.

Dr. Moore’s work in teaching at
-Union Seminary has shown a steady
advance. He was an assitant in-
structor there in 1883-84; then ad-
junct Professor of Hebrew 1884-86:
associate Professor of Hebrew and
Old Testament 1885-90; Professor
of Hebrew and Old Testament ef-
fective with 1889. In 1904 he was
elected President of the Seminary,
which position he still occupies.

Dr. Moore has been the recipient
of practically all the honors within
the gift of the Southern Presbyte-
rian) Church. Through a period
dating from his school days to the
present. he has been greatly beloved
and esteemed. Handsome. richly
endowed with gifts of heart and

personality, he has had the friend-
ship of all who have come within
the range of his wonderful mag-
netism.
were his intellectual —accomplish-
ments and his oratorical powers
that he was chosen in his Soph-
omore vear to represent his literary
ysaciety in the commencement ccle-
bration, and from that day onward
whenever there was platform work
to be done by one qualified by grace
of manner, eloquence of tongue, and
beauty of rhetoric Dr. Moore has
bcen steadily put forward by his
friends as one admirably equipped
for such service. The highest gift
| within the power of the Church, that
of Moderator of the General Assem-
bly, was his in 1908.

Dr. Moore has found time from
this teaching’ and administrative
duties to write several books.
among which may be mentioned.
‘“A Year In Europe,” published in
11904; “The Indispensable Book,” in
1910, and “Appreciations and His-
|terical Addresses,” in 1914.
Davidson College is glad to honor
_this noble son for his high worth
and his usefulness, and as an ex-

penent of the principles for which
‘Davidson stands. We are glad that

intellect. and possessed of a winning -

In his college days such -

we can have him next spring for the
fourth series in the Otts Lecture-
ship. We will be honored, in turn,
by the visit of this distinguished
man,
