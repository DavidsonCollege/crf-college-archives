By ROBERT GRUBB

Sebastian Koch continued his excellent
performance for the men’s tennis team last
week, leading the Wildcats to four victories
in five matches. Koch, despite having his
16-match winning streak snapped against
Wake Forest, ran his season record to 26-6.

“Sebastian has just been playing incred-
ible all season. He has an awesome record,
considering our difficult schedule,” said
Coach Jeff Frank. “Tim Hagood has also
been outstanding at number three singles.”

Hagood has posted.a 24-8 record thus far.
The Cats have been led by Koch and
Hagood’s singles this season. The doubles
combinations had difficulties earlier in the
season, but have been playing well recently,
according to Frank. »:. »

Wildcats 4-2 since break |

By JOE HOOVER

The Wildcat baseball
team got back on the win-
ning track by going 4-2 after
returning from adisappoint-
ing spring break. The Cats
continued, however, to lose
games to weather.

Three games were rained
out last week, bringing the
season total to 19. Head
coach Jim Stoeckel said,
“With this many games
rained out it’s hard to de-
velop any consistencies. It
would be nice to play.”

Davidson certainly came
to play against Winthrop,
shaking off the rainy blues
to score twelve runs on ten
hits to win, 12-10. Second
baseman Mike Holland led
the way, going two-for-four
and driving in five runs.
Mike Liebdzinski (3 RBI),
Steve Livesey, and Ron
Krnacik (3 runs) contrib-
uted two hits apiece, while
Ralph Isernia scored three
times. ;

The. Wildcats dominated
throughout, establishing a
12-4 lead behind the pitch-
ing of Greg Wilcox.
Winthrop scored six runs off

ry

two Davidson relievers in
the ninth to make the came
close. Joe Azzolino came in
with the bases loaded to get
the final out and earn his
first save.

The Cats travelled to
Hickory the next day to take
on Lenoir-Rhyne, only to
lose a 16-13 slugfest.
Davidson held a 5-4 lead
after five, but Lenoir-Rhyne
scored ten runs in the sixth.
Davidson made acomeback
attempt with five in the
eighth and three in the ninth,
but it was not enough. ©

Nine Wildcats collected
at least one hit in the game.
Kmacik (2H, 4R, 2RB)),
Liebdzinski (2,3,1), and
Azzolino (2,3) led the way.
Linn Williams was two-for-

Isernia and Tim Kerns also
had two hits.

After being rained out
against Mt. Olive, Davidson

took on N.C. A&T in-

Greensboro and came away

game from the start, scoring
eight runs in the first inning.

Liebdzinski (3H), and Hol-
land (two doubles, 3RBI),
with Livesey and Williams
chipping in two hits apiece,
and Kerns scoring three
runs.

Davidson split a two

game series with the ACC,
beating Duke 5-4 on a dra-
matic eleventh inning home
run by Mikio Aoki, and then
dropping a 15-4 decision to
Clemson the next night.
