Four Literary Societies Make Plans

For Initiating

Eus, Phis, Pani, ane and Metros Hold.
First Meetings of Year this

Week
The four literary societies of Da-
vidson are already laying plans for,

what looks to be one of the biggest
vears in their history. Each society
has made arrangements for the recep-
tion and initiatiton of the new men, al-
ways an important feature. It is hoped
and expected that more Freshmen will
identify themselves with one of them
as soon as possible.

The Eumenean (Iu) Society meets
in Eu Hall every Thursday night. Its
membership is largely, though not ex-
clusively, composed of
men. The first meeting will be held
Thursday night of this week. The re-
ception of Freshmen will probably take
place a week later. The Paaee of the}
society are: President, L. Elkins ;
vice-president, J. R. aera secre-
tary, J. A. Bouvier,
to identify himself with this society
may get in touch with any one of these
men who will give him more detailed
information,

The Metrophilian (Metro) Society |
meets in Phi Hall on Tuesday night. |
The majority of the members of this |

society are from North Carolina. A
meeting was held last Tuesday night.

The new men will be pledged on next |

Tuesday night and initiated on the fol- |

lowing Tuesday. The officers are:
President, W. Z. Bradford; vice- ine

ident, W. M. Gracey; secretary, H.
Lawson, A. M. McBryde and R. |
-arker have charge of the sane ae
Freshmen.

The Pandeinie (Pan) Society meets

on Tuesday night in Iu Hall. The

membership of this society is made up |
to a considerable extent of men from,

beyond the borders of North Carolina.
The first meeting has already taken
place and the initiation of new mem-
bers will, probably be held on next
Tuesday night. The officers of the,
society are: President, W. M. Cox 3)
vice-president, H. B. Price; secretary,
F, T. Franklin; critic, D. B. Walthail.
AS SRY Hudgins and D, B. Walthall
compose the committee on the recep- |
tion and initiation of Freshmen.

The Philanthropic (Phi) Society
meets on Thursday night in Phi Hall.
The membership is made up largely of

North Carolina men. The first meeting |

will be held on Thursday night of this
week, The initiatiton will probably |
take place on next Thursday evening.
The officers of the society are: Pres- |
ident, J. L. McLean; critic, P. J. Story. |

Although the membership of each
pair of societies is made up to a cer-

tain extent from either out-of-state or |

in-state men, yet these lines are not
rigidly drawn and each Freshman will
find a ready welcome in any one of
them, no matter whether he hails from

the Old North State or from beyond |

its borders. The Eumenean, Philan-
thropic and Metrophilian Societies
usually have Freshmen societies until
after Christmas, when all Freshmen
are taken into the Senior society. The

Pandeinic Society does not follow this |
custom but receites new members im- |
mediately into full and regular stand- |

ing.

ALPHA PHI EPSILON IS NEW
FRATERNITY

A chapter of Alpha Phi Epsilon, the
national literary society fraternity, has

been established at Davidson.

last spring when Gavel and Forum,

the local honorary fraternity with the}
same purpose, was transformed into |

the Phi Chapter of Alpha Phi Epsilon.

Alpha Phi Epsilon has been in exist- |

ence for several years and embraces a
large number of chapters,
chiefly among the more prominent col-

leges and universities of the South and |

West. Its purpose is to promote the
work of literary societies in general
and to honer those men who have at-
tained distinction in their society work.
Although it is a comparatively young
fraternity, yet it has already taken its
place among the leading forensic or-
ganizations of the country.

campus.

‘SIX PARTIES MAKE AUTO
TRIPS TO PACIFIC COAST

| Western Trips Popular With Boys
During Summer Months

No less than six different parties of
Davidson men have made trips to the
West this summer. All of these men
report a fine time and wonderful scen-
ery. The trips were made at a very
\small cost; one man even coming back
with more money than when he left.
| The first party to leave was com-
posed of Hugh Wells and his brother,
Lucien. These boys took the middle
trip, going out through Tennessee, .\r-
kansas and straight out to San Fran-
cisco, They made the trip in seven
weeks, and came back by way of Chi-
cago, Niagara Falls, New York and
Washington.

The second party to leave was com-

Johnnie McCallum, and John Adams.
These boys left immediately-after com-
mencement, and in the course of eight
weeks journeyed 11,000 miles. They
{took the southern trip down through
| Texas, out*through New Mexico, and |
fon to the coast. They were traveling |
in a renowned “Tin Lizzie.” and Bill!
Cooper reports that she never missed a
lick on the entire trip and that she was
sold at the end of the trip for only two
hundred dollars less than the price for
which she was bought. Bill says that
ithe trip cost three hundred dollars less
than they estimated.

The next party to leave was com-
|posed of Henry Morris, Hugh Smith,
Doctor Porter, and Randolph Jones.
This group left on the 9th of June and

| was two anda half months on the road. :
down -
|through Georgia, Alabama, and on to:

| Leaving Davidson, they went
| Baton Rouge, La. They then traveled
jon to New Orleans seeing the sights
and cities. It was from this place that
they went out to the biggest sugar mill
|in'the world, where they spent a most
|interesting day seeing the non-salsugi-
|nous products being made. After leav-
ling New Orleans, they went on to
Houston, San Antonio and El Paso,
ithe home of Railroad Jones. Here
|they spent four days in a most delight-
ful visit with Railroad. Then they
headed north to the Apache Indian
reservation, where the Mescalero In-
'dians hang and hang out. They were
here on the Fourth of July and wit-
nessed a most patriotic celebration. It
| was intensely ‘cold, the place being at
an altitude of seven thousand feet
above sea level, but the Indians did not
seem to mind, being seemingly carried
away by the fervor of their patriotism.
They danced such weird dances that
{one would have to go to Jones to see
exactly what their technique was. Then
they headed west across the continental
divide at an altitude of eight thousand
feet, on to the Grand Canyon. Trans-

versing the road in the bed of the Col-—

orado River, they finally came to
Needles, Calif., where the heat was
114 degrees in the shade. Henry Mor-
ris said that he dropped an egg on the
pavement, and that before it could
spread out good it was fried. Then
they passed on to Los Angeles, but
were afraid to tackle Hollywood. They
traveled slowly northward up the coast
until they came to Portland, Ore.,
whence they speeded their journey
across the deserts to Chicago, on down
the Lincoln highway to Washington
and thence home through Virginia.

| Several interesting occurrences hap-
pened on the trip. At Eugene, Ore.,
a smaJ] town 50 miles south of Port-
land, they met Zan McAffister, who
had arrived there by the northern route
through Canada, Banff and Lake |
Louise. Twice they met Mr. and Mrs. |
J. B. Whitener, of Cornelius, who were |

posed of Bill Cooper, Harry Russell, |

traveling with a bunch of Trinity men.

The first time they ran across them was
in a tourist camp in San Francisco,
and the second was in Yellowstone Na-
tional Park,

Goat Lewis, traveling just a week
behind Dr. Porter and his party, work:

ed his way through to Los Angeles.
where he toiled four weeks as a car-
penter’s assistant, making enough

money to finance his entire trip home,
which he made from the west coast in
13 days.

All the men interviewed were en-
thusiastic over their trips and say that
if the opportunity comes to any David-
son man to take a similar trip he should
jump at the chance. So next summer
when the traveling bug starts serateh-
ing, just leave old Kate in the field,
crank up the old family jitney and
highhball it for the tall timber.

Go west, young man, go West!

COURT We CONTROL
(C ‘ontitiued from page 1)

alties to be meted out to unruly
Freshmen—far from it. every
Freshman who appeared before the
court during the past year was re-
ceived with brotherly sympathy by
men who loved Davidson and who
were cager to promote the interests
of every man inthe college. Though
many Freshmen were sent away
without a penalty attached not one
left without his errors pointed out
to him and without the sympathetic
reasoning and advice by those men
who were so concerned about the fu-
ture of Davidson and its ideals. .\nd
we believe that we are safe in stat-
ing that not a man left the doors of
the court except with the conviction
that he had received a square deal
from eight men who were his
friends.

But this does not cover the activ-

feated and = our opportunties — lost.
But our plans are broader than this
and our program one that should
make out of every new man a more
loyal son of Davidson and a man
more able to meet and take advan-
tage of the opportunities which he
cannot avoid during his four years
on the campus. In short our pro-
gram is this:

The Court of Control has provided
certain rales to which a Freshman
must conform if he would not be
conspicious and thus be summoned
for discipline, But this is only part.
Whatewe believe will be most effec-
tive in guiding the Freshmen into
the proper channels for his stay in
Davidson is the following:

In conjunction with the officers of
the student body we have. divided
the Freshman class into small
groups. A\t the head of cach group
there has been placed a competent
Senior as leader of the group. We
have provided speakers from the up-
per classes who will) meet these
groups individually and cach present
a particular phase of college life.
There are a darge number of sub-
jects to be presented and no doubt
the program will extend through the
entire year, Hach month the leaders
of the groups will investigate the
grades of his men and visit theny per-
sonally sas Te fit. offering his
help to those who need it. THe will
also keep in touch with the campus
aetivities of his men and advise them
accordingly.

Anyone can readily see that with
this method in operation much good
can be accomplished and many
errors avoided which formerly were
due simply to ignorance On the part
of the new men,

In addition to this the court

Now Davidson men, we all know
that this year is a turning point in
the history of our college. The op-
portunity is ours to make this the
greatest vear in her history. The
Court of Control is one cog in our
wheel of progress that is rolling on

support, and we pledge our sincere
service to you and our Alma Mater.
