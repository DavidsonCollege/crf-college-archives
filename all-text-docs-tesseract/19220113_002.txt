There was much talk before Christmas
as to just what would replace the old
bell of Chambers. Many suggestions
wtre made but nothing was decided up-|
on definitely. Bugles were used to give

ucation under a Secretary who shall have| warning for Classes until something bet-
those powers and duties set forth in the! ter could be devised. Major Hearn was

The subject for the Wake Forest de-|

eral Government should own and operate |

stitutionality waived,” with Davidson up-|
holding the negative. |

JUNIOR-SENIOR DEBATE TO
BE HELD SOON AFTER EXAMS

The main item of interest in David-
son’s literary world is the approaching
Junior-Senior debate. Last year the con- |
test was won by the Philanthropic Soci- |
ety when they downed their old rivals, |
the Eumencans. This year, however, |
two new societies are in the field, the |
Metrophilian, daughter of . the Philan-|
thropic, and the daughter of the Eu-
menean, which has not been christened.
The Eumenean Society is out to avenge
last year’s defeat, but last year’s winner
and the new entries are well up in front
and it will be a gruelling race to the
tape.

The question for discussion is one of
international interest, concerning the
autonomy of ‘the Philippines, an im-
portant phase of the age old struggle be-
tween the East and the West.

The preliminaries in the Philanthropic
Society resulted in the choosing of J. I.
Knight, H. K. Russell and S. R. Sloan as
representatives of the former winners.
L A. Taylor, L. P. Burney and W. M.
McLeod will represent the Metrophilian
Society. The representatives of the
other societies will be chosen Tuesday
night.

The debate will be held several days
before the start of the mid-year exams,
the exact date not having been difinitely
arranged,

PLEASANT TIMES SPENT BY
MEN HERE DURING HOLIDAYS

Although for various reasons it was
impossible for eleven boys to go home
for the holidays, at the end of that
festive period they voted unanimously
that they had spent a most enjoyable
time on the hill. For, not only was the
rest refreshing, but the time was very
profitably passed at checker tourna-
ments, tennis and golf. At the latter
two they were ably assisted by several
young ladies who were visitors on the
hill for the holidays.

LIBRARY RECEIVES VOLUME
OF THE MENTOR MAGAZINE

The library received a most delightful
and valuable Christmas gift from Mr. J.
C. Harper, ’15, of Winston-Salem, N. C.
in ‘the form of five bound volumes of
the “Mentor Magazine” with an index
to the pictures bound in,;a separate vol-
ume. All who know of the beautiful pic-
tures issued bi-monthly by the Mentor
Company will appreciate the great value
of this addition to the reference depart-

SHEARER HALL CLASS ROOMS
BEING USED FOR STUDYING

The excuse that you have no quiet
place to “bone” at night is no longer
worth very much since two classrooms
in Shearer Hall have been thrown open
for this purpose The recitation rooms |
of Doctors McConnell and Sentelle are
being used at present. These rooms are
warm, well lighted and above all quiet,
almost to the point of solitude, since
only the studious few are using them.

If your room is crowded and if gangs

like to gather there to talk over subjects
which are entirely foreign to books,
these study halls are exactly the place to
fo,
. The rooms will be much in demand
during the next week as the exams are
hanging over our heads and most of
the students need to “put out” a little on
almost everything. If your grades are
suspended just above the passing mark
by a narrow thread, and your room-
mates refuse to keep quiet for some rea-
other, you had better tell his
satanic majesty with his temptations to
get behind thee and go to “boning” in
the study hall. Else you might have to
join the very select chorus of “wailers”
and “teeth-gnashers.”

METROPHILIAN SOCIETY HAS
GOOD PROGRAM AT OPENING

The daughter of the Philanthropic Lit-
erary Society has been named the Métro-
rhilian, the name suggested by Dr. Hard-
ing. The motto and emblem of the new
society have not yet been chosen,

Owing to the absence of the president,
R. P. Brown, the vice-president presided
over the meeting. Two extemporaneous
debates were held in place of the usual
program. W. P. Kimsey and F, W. Smith
debated the subject, “Resolved, That R.
O. T. C. at Davidson should be compul-
sory throughout the entire college
course. The debate was unusually inter-
esting, there being a good basis of ar-
gument for both sides. Dew and McCain
discussed the subject, “Resolved, That
the Davidson College boarding houses;
having 50 or more boarders, should pay
tax of $15 per year to the city schools,
and those having less than 50 boarders,
a tax of $10.” The subject was discussed
well by both sides. Following the de-
bates, R. T. Price made an unusually
good oration.

A short and snappy business session
followed the debates and plans were
niade for mock trial on Thursday, the

THE COMMISSARY

There is one place, of all others, on
the hill which we have all delighted to
knock, and yet we have appreciated it
too, that is the Commissary.

It is being run this year by two Se-
niors, under the direction of the Ath-
letic Association, and it is their desire to

-serve-us-with-maximum--valucs™at-mini=

mum prices.

The Commissary is one of our best
friends and no matter how much we
knock it, we go right there when we
need money. This is shown in the fact
that the Commissary has loaned to or-
ganizations, the student body as a whole,
and to us as individuals for football
blankets and for railroad fare and such
things. Then, too, all football equip-
ment was sold to the men going out at
cost.

The Commissary wants no popularity

or notoriety except in so far as the back-
ing of the student body will make it
popular. For it is our store, fellows, and
our friend. Let’s show them that we ap-
preciate it.
There are to be two tailoring open-
ings there this spring, one is this week,
and let's, at least, go down, look over
the line and when we see what we want,
buy it. The Davidsonian carries a full-
page advertisement for them this week.
Read it and go and see for yourself. You
will enjoy trading at the Commissary—
they please you.

mitory at least and there will be room-
ing capacity for well over a hundred stu-
dents.

While the new dormitory will not
carry with it all the tradition and senti-
ment wrapped up in Chambers, it is
hoped that the spirit of the old building
will reside in the new and that its pro-
tecting wings will still watch over the
welfare of Davidson College.
