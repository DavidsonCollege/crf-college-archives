MotnersDay ey se wil te constued o| WIth Some Final Thoughts

(CPS) - Animal rights activists
have scheduled protests across
the country on Mother’s Day
weekend to draw attention to the
“inhumane and unsanitary condi-
tions” associated with the pro-
duction of milk-fed veal.

The May 10protestsare being
coordinated by the Farm Animal
Reform Movement.

Among other things, FARM
says that young calves are chained
in tiny crates and forced to stand
or lic in excrement and be force-
fed a synthetic liquid diet that
keeps the animals barely alive for
16 weeks until slaughter. The
treatment is designed to make the
animal’s flesh pale and soft for
gourmet dining.

FARM President Dr. Alex
Hershaft said Mother’s Day was
particularly appropriate for the
nationwide protest because the
holiday is traditionally identified
with love, compassion and the
bond between mother and child.

Local Executive, Rodgers,
Donates Scholarship

By Kevin Miller

B. D. Rodgers, chairman of
Rodgers Builders Inc. of Charlotte,
and: his wife Pat, are donating
$100,000 to Davidson over the next
five years for the establishment of
the B.D. Rodgers Scholarship
Fund.

The grant will provide need-
based scholarships for graduates
of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg-
County public school system and
will be awarded for the first time to
members of the upcoming Class of
1996.

President John W. Kuykendall
thanked Rodgers and his wife for
the gift by saying, “This commit-
ment is great news! I know per-
sonally what a difference it will
make for a prospective student. A
scholarship like the one Pat and

B.D. have established helped me
come from Myers Park High
School to Davidson years ago.
Their gift will help Davidson con-
tinue to build a student body of the
highest caliber, even as assistance
programs shrink all across the
country.”

Need-based scholarships are
one of the main goals of the na-
tional Campaign for Davidson, the
five-year $150 million fundraising
effort to increase endowments for
faculty positions, student scholar-
ships, academic resources, capital
improvements and annual operat-
ing expenses. The Rodgers schol-
arship brings the total grants re-
ceived during the Campaign to
$95.7 million (after only two years
in existence).

next year.”

~ Student Government Association President Anthony Foxx supports
the new Ethnic Studies concentration saying, “I think that there is
extraordinary potential for an Ethnic Studies concentration to make an

impact on Davidson students.”

Foxx also said that, “there can be a link between [the concentration].

and the tensions that have been on: campus.”
Williams, agreed with Foxx, saying, “if these issues can be dealt with
explicitly as part ofan academic program as wellasin social pemnlys that

is good.”

On April 2, the Davidson com-
munity received an announcement
that Chuck Hasty, thecollege Chap-
lain, would be moving on toa new
position next year. On April 23, I
had the opportunity to talk with
him about the past, present, and
future.

When asked about his accom-

* plishments in the past three years,

Hasty responded immediately.
“On one level, I have been the
most satisfied by the growth of the
students I’ve been close to. That
has been humbling and amazing to
me,” hesaid. Hecitedexamplesof
members of the class of ’93, who
entered Davidson during the same
year he did, and many of the stu-
dents who have been influenced
by his teachings. He went on to
say, “On the second level, I hope

that people are more aware ofthe
chaplain’s office and of the activi-
ties that come out of it, especially
opportunities for worship.”

~ Hasty spoke of his efforts to
draw the Davidson community
together by, in his own words,
“breaking down the barrier that the
railroad tracks represent. I’ve been
encouraged by the heightened
awareness and focused energy of
bringing the Davidson [commu-
nity] across the tracks and the
Davidson college community to-
gether,” he said.

On the subject of the recent
campus unrest and the difficulties
that we have begun to address,
Hasty was both optimistic and
hopeful. “I see this past year as
being pivotal in the transition to a
more loving community. That
means “going beyond mere toler-

ance,” he said.

He talked about racial tension,
the establishment of the F.L.A.G.
chapter, the debate over the alco-
hol policy and numerous other
recent issues, by saying simply, “I
hope that these issues will not be
swept under the rug.”

Hasty’s impactasan energetic,
spiritual leader has been especially
felt by the students.. Stephen Hill,
arising junior, spoke eloquently of
the influence the Chaplain has had
in his life. “He’s really brought
energy tothis campus, | think, both
socially and spiritually. He’ll be
missed by everyone, even people
who didn’t know him quite as well
as I do,” he said.

Hasty spoke with enthusiasm
about his new position as pastor of

Kennedy-Cuomo Promotes Human Rights

By John David Semones

The 900 room was full this
past Wednesday as students, fac-
ulty, and members of the commu-
nity gathered to hear guest speaker,
Kerry Kennedy-Cuomo. After
graduating from Brown Univer-
sity in 1982 and Boston College

’ Law school in 1987, Cuomo be-

cameaninternational human rights
lawyer. Mrs. Cuomo is executive
director for the Center for Human
Rights and founder of the Robert
F. Kennedy Memorial Center for
Human Rights, named in honor of
her father, the late senator.

As executive director of the
Robert F. Kennedy Center, Cuomo

_ works with human rights centers -
around the world.

In countries
suchas Kenya, Chile, and Czecho-
slovakia, the Center works to fund
libraries and promote education.
As an international human rights
lawyer, Cuomo is able to work
with specific individuals, even
young teenagers, who are bold
enough to stand up and fight for the
basic rights we take for granted.
“These are today’s heros,” com-
mented Cuomo.

In her speech, “Promoting
Human Rights and Public Serv-
ice”, Cuomo described what is
involved in the commitmentto fight
for human rights. Commitment,
she said, involves asking ourselves
the questions, “’Whatare the diffi-
culties we face?’, ‘Can weachieve
peace?’, and ‘What can I do to
help?’” Cuomo also commented
that, “when the most powerful
democratic country in the world
fails to feed its own hungry or
house its own homeless, the war
goes on--there is no peace.”

Mrs. Cuomo recently did a
commentary for the television
show Network Earth. As part of
her presentation, Cuomo showed
the video which will be airing on
local T. V.. within the next two
weeks. For Networ ,Cuomo
traveled to an island in the Philip-
pines to talk with,human rights
workers who are fighting to save
theirrainforests. Theisland, which
houses the largestremaining tropi-
cal rainforest in the Philippines, is
under siege by loggers who are
clearcutting the forests at an in-
credible rate.

‘Cuomo spoke with members
of Haribon, the largest environ-
mental group on the island, who
have been fighting the loggers since
the group’s start in 1988. Cuomo
was taken by boat and shown the
areas where rampant and highly
illegal logging was happening.
Tribal leaders cite the excessive
logging as the cause for food short-
ages and for silting (which de-
stroys the rivers and other water
sources). Journalists who have
tried to cover the logging story
along with members. of Haribon,
have been slapped with law suits
and threatened by the more power-
ful logging companies.

Cuomo congratulated the
human rights programs here at
Davidson and was amazed at the
fact that over fifty percent of the
student body is involved in com-
munity service. She concluded
with words of encouragement for
the Davidson programs and with
the wish that even more. students
would become involved in pro-
tecting human rights in the future.

Food Drive Raises 15 Tons... Of Red Tape

By Kevin Miller

The Russian aid program or-
ganized by exchange student Oleg
Ordinartsev, Mrs. . Rosemarie
Raynol and her husband, Dr. Char-
les Raynal, raised three times its
original food goal by collecting
735 boxes of food (15 tons) and
five boxes of medical supplies all
throughout the month of March.
These boxes were to fly to Moscow,
via a United States Air Force air-
craft, and then be taken to Pyati-

gorsk, Ordinartsev’s small home=

town, to be distributed to members

’_ of achurch there.

On March 28, the boxes, which
came from many Presbyterian
churches and organizations in
Charlotte and around North Caro-
lina (only two actually came from
Davidson College), were unloaded
at a Charlotte National Guard Air
Force base. The unloading, which
took about three hours to com-
plete, was done by about thirty

volunteers from the National

Guard, by about twenty-five vol-
unteers from the Davidson, Elkin
and Concord Community and by
about fifteen members. of SAE
fraternity. The event was covered
by twoareanews channels and two
area radio stations.
Unfortunately, this took place
over four weeks ago, and the boxes
are still sitting at the base. Why? -
well, apparently the State Depart-
ment, whooriginally organized the
food to reach by air, planned to
ship the goods by boat. Yet, in the
process of some refiling of appli-
cations by the group from Davidson
(they had to so some reapplying
when they realized that they were
going to achieve 15 tons) to Wash-
ington, the State Department lost

the papers. Therefore, the Na-.

tional Guard commander who has
been waiting for word from Wash-
ington on where and when to take
the boxes, has heard nothing about
the dropoff point.

On learning -of the “lost pa-

, Ordinartsev and Raynol
faxed copies of their applications
again to the State Department, and
attempted to find out when, where
and how the food could be shipped.
Again, the State Department had
no answers because they have to
wait for the Secretary of State to
“re-okay” the process. So, in es-
sence, the 15 tons could sit on the
base for aneven longer time than it
already has.

Ordinartsev did say though,
“T'd like to thank all of the people
who helped in the collection of the
food. Theefforthas been extremely
wonderful. I’d also like to thank
the members of SAE who came
outand helped unload the boxes.
They made a huge difference.”

Ordinartsev also reemphasized
the fact thatthe Russian people
will be and already are very grate-
ful forthe hugeamountoffoodand —
supplies. Hopefully, those people -
will get to see that shipment in the
near future.
