Moonstruck celebrates happy coexistence of romance family
And be-sure not to miss the. previews -

By BRUCE PLOURDE

I have my favorite cinemas in
Charlotte. They all have the same
features that I have come to asso-
ciate with a relaxing and pleasant
evening on the town. The floors
have the same carpeting, the bath-
rooms have the same tile, the
jewelry display cases contain the
same exorbitantly priced candies.
Upon first entering the theater,
holding my large soda and drag-
ging my large box of popcorn
behind me, I always start back a
little when I see the fluorescent
blood-red screen, looking like a
scene out of “The Shining.” I pick
my seat, and then proceed to lose
half my popcorn and soda down
my pants leg as the seat lurches
forward underneath me. I am
ready.

The lights dim, and I see pre-
views of coming attractions.
These are like little movies all
their own, as enjoyable as the
cartoons which once introduced
films, moons ago. Two or three,
sometimes as many as four mov-
ies are encapsulated before my
eyes. In these the producers
kindly show me most of the best
scenes and the best dialogue from
their films, so that I don’t even
have to go to the movie to review
It.

Then comes my favorite part,
the segment of the pre-movie
entertainment. which keeps me
coming back to these theaters. It’s
a short movie all by itself. The
screen shows a universe of pop-
com, candy and other cinema
trash floating serenely through
space, while happy carnival music
plays to the garbage’s move-

ments. From out of the infinite
comes a biodegradable soda cup,
like the one that sits half-full on
my knee, becoming larger as it
rushes toward the audience. The
camera pans to the right, follow-
ing the space cup. The music
becomes a dramatic crescendo as
the cup soars toward the giant
space garbage can, then ends in a
bold heroic when the space cup
transports inside the space con-
tainer. I just love that. I always
clap and cheer when the cup va-
porizes against the can.
Oftentimes the best part of my

outing has been the previews. I sit
back, having made myself quite at
home by then, and say to myself,
“All that could ruin my evening
now isacrummy movie.” Iam all
anticipation as I await the movie,
wondering if it will be a comple-
ment to those exquisitely con-
cocted shorts or if will be a disap-
pointment. Understandably, ri-
valling these transcendent video
masterplots takes quite a movie. I
am rather frequently disap-
pointed.

story follows the pains and pleas-
ures of a very Italian and very
Catholic family residing in con-
temporary Little Italy, New York.
Though entirely ethnocentric, it,
explores relationships which ex-
tend to everybody, regardless of
their background. Moonstruck
not only explores, but celebrates
with humor and affection, the

happy coexistence of romance,
love and the family.
