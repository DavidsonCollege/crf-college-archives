’ATON'S SPRING SERVICES

&

Dr. George D. Heaton, minister
of the Myers Park Baptist Church
in Charlotte, most ably conducted

the annual Spring Services this
week, ‘The services, even the un-
compulsory evening services, were
exceptionally well attended and

those attending found the speaker

practical, frank, and direct, but not

without a sense of humor and a
aan

ready smile. Nal
\t the first s#vice on Tuesday
morning, Dr. Heaton “in seven

minutes” stressed, not only the im.
portance, but the necessity of every
man to take a stand for his Chris-
tian religion. Prayers by two mem-
of the junior class preceded
sermon. Tom Patterson and
Chuck Kirby led in prayer at the

bers
each
opening service.

“The Design of God Life,”
the subject of Dr. Heaton’'s
first evening service in which Bob
Patton sill Alexander led in
prayer. Dr. Heaton, in his message,
pointed out that if anyone is to find
a real destiny, this must be found
im the obedience to God's law. The

and

design of God for life operates on
the this law. There are
loopholes in this law and in
order to gain the highest design for
our life, obedience is a “must.’’ This
design as given by God includes

no

treating human beings as persons
und not as things, being honest with
all men, showing kindness to warm

just with all men. These are’ part
basic laws and there is
way can live a true Chris-
tian lite and maneuver around such
principles. It's the design of God
that we live with courage, not with
fear; forgiving hearts, not
with hating hearts, and with hopeful
Attitudes, and not with clouded out-
fooks.

After the prayers of Jim Sher-
and Newt Robertson, Dr.
Heaton began his third service. The
need for a return to Jesus Christ
and away from the chaos and con-
fusion, the offsprings of dubiosity

talk. “The one werd, dubiosity,

Heaton said. Men in their skepti-

The Lost Room

By PETE KALOGRIDIS
There is a lost room in chambers.
Unfortunately, the average David-

son student is unaware of the ex-
istence of the college museum in
Room 321, Even a more unfortunate
situation is realized when those who
are aware of this fact fail to take
advantage of the museum as’ a
medium through which they might
well spend some time, profitably
from the viewpoint of enjoyment as
well as education:

For the museum does contain
‘many items of extreme interest.
As a means for preparing this

article, this reporter naturally made
a thorough visit through the
museum, I was frankly well pleased
by the large variety of interesting
subjects—which—are—treated—in- the
small museum of its size. Certain-
ly anyone, if he would but devote
enough of his time, could find many
things which would more than claim
his attention,

Vrominent among such items of
interest would be the many stuffed
ducks, and = small, animals.
Many of these animals, especially
the birds and owls, are of such a

birds,

of African arrows, spearheads, and
knives invites one’s inspection.

But the person who is capable of
appreciating such items of interest
tarries not long on any one sub-
ject. For there are other things to
be seen—large bones of many
animals such as the elephant’ and
horse and the skulls of a gorrila,
lion, and leopard, along with others.

And the student of history is
by no means slighted. There are
several ancient clay tablets with

inscriptions which date back into
biblical times—things which should
be a joy to any man who has any-
thing even similar to an imagina-
tion and cafi let his mind specula-
tively wander back several thousand
years into past civilization,

Nor the lover of the sea
slighted. He may enjoy a fine col-
lection of sea shells along with a
magnificently, mounted sailfish and
many other types of sea creatures
such as the crab, crab
and giant clam.

But the land is,not to be outdone
by the sea. A snake collection along-
side collections of different types
of rocks and wood makes a unique

GRADUATE EXAMS

The Graduate’ Record Exami-
nation will be given to the en-
tire sophomore class, it was an-
nounced recently by Prof.
George Abernathy. The test will
be given in two installments,
one on Wednesday, April 13,
from 1:30 p. m. to 5:30, and
on Thursday, April 14, from
8:25 a. m. to 10:25.

easily demand immediate attention
from. even the most skeptical spec-
tater. Other such items would ,in-
clude a collection of fluorite stones
which reflect a variety of bedutiful
colors when exposed to a purple
light.

Not only is a rock collection to
be had, but a very interesting  col-
lection of Indian stoné>-weapons
is also on hand. In addition, along
the line of weapons, a show case

contrast. Indeed, along with the
many stuffed animals the land is
well represented.

This, then is but a small portion
ofl the many interesting items to be
found-in the museums. Many would
find it well worth their time to
browse through the museums, for
it was established for the benefits
of the student body. | .

‘And the students would be find-
ing something when they truly
found the lost room.
