Seminar visits Transcendental Meccas

By AIDA DOSS
tures Editor

It’s not too often that educa-
tion can be taken out of the
classroom—even on a warm
spring afternoon. Bees, nosy
dogs, and the threat of rain
generally combine to make the
outdoor classroom a dangerous

proposition. But sometimes,

the class may go further than
merely outside the building, as
one of my classes did this past
weekend.

Last Thursday morning at 3
a.m., six members of Professor
Randy Nelson’s Transcenden-
talism seminar began a journey
to Concord, Massachusetts. We
were off for a quick look at the
stomping grounds of Emerson,
Thoreau, Hawthorne, Bronson,
Alcott and other literary bea-
cons of the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury philosophical movement.

Our first pilgrimage was to
Walden Pond, the site of Henry
David Thoreau’s famous experi-
ment in self-reliant living. The
pond is preserved and main-
tained by the state, and is kept
in its natural condition as much
as possible. Irregularly shaped,
with coves and inlets pock-
marking its perimeter, the pond
lay calm and clear. We- mean-

* dered along its shore, stopping

now and then to stare out over
the water or to examine the
various mosses along the bank
or to listen to the numerous bird
sounds which carried over the
pond.

On a slight rise about 200 feet
from the water several granite
blocks connected by a heavy
cabin which Thoreau built for

$28.15% in 1845. ‘Further up -

the hill, the railroad tracks (to-
ward which the-man in the
woods remained ambivalent)
ran past on their way to
Concord, only about two miles
away. Contrary to popular be-

‘lief, Thoreau was not a hermit

and did not shun the town’s
society; his main purpose in
moving to Walden Pond was,
instead, a journey of self-
knowledge and exploration, a
journey to discover his own
attitudes about the way he
desired to spend his life.

On the second day of our
visit, we were privileged to meet
Tom Blanding, a friend of Dr.
Nelson’s and a prominént Tho-
reau scholar. He guided us
around several of the grave-

‘yards in town where various

Revolutionary War heroes and
town politicians were buried.

- The tour culminated with a hike |

up to Author’s Ridge where
many of the major and minor
Transcendalist writers lay bu-
fied. Considering Thoreau’s
penchant for simplicity, his own

headstone was not surprising— -

a simple marker about .six
inches high with the name
“Henry” on it in the Thoreau
family plot.

Later that afternoon, we vis-
ited the Old Manse where
Emerson and later Hawthorne
had done some of their writing.
Sophia Peabody, Hawthorne’s
wife, apparently had a fetish for
scratching on windows with a
diamond; several panes are
littered with epigrams and mes-
sages to Nathaniel. j

We also toured the Emerson
house, a large structure befit-

stature. Some of its outstan-
ding features included~a large
bay window in the second story
master bedroom, a handmade
dollhouse (with furniture) for
the children, and several beauti-
ful and intricately designed:
carpets.

Our third visit Saturday
afternoon was to the Thoreau
Lyceum, a sort of museum in
which some of Thoreau’s furni- »
ture, letters, and personal arti-
facts were housed. Here, Blan-
ding talked freely of Thoreau,
