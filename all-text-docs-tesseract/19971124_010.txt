DURHAM — Due to illness and
injury as a rookie last year, Stephen
Marshall toiled largely in the shadow
of hyped classmate Landry Kosmalski,

Notebook

whoearned Southern Conference Fresh-
man of the Year honors.

No'longer.

His 20-point, 14-rebound perfor-
mance in Thursday night’s 100-65 loss
to Duke represented a coming out party
of sorts for the 6-foot-8 forward from
Midlothian, Va.

Marshall hit 9-of-15 field goals in
24 minutes of action before fouling out
with 2:43 left in the second half.

In perhaps the game’s most amaz-
ing individual statistic, nine of his 14

boards came on the offensive glass,
“Stephen Marshall battled,” coach
Bob McKillop said.

“That’s alittle bit ofasilverlining. .

He had an outstanding performance.”

The Blue Devil contingentagreed,
as Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski called
Marshall “very poised.”

“They’re a tough team,” Trajan
Langdon said in the Blue Devil
lockerroom after the game.

“And No. 52 was playing great in
there.”

While Duke was not expecting
such an effort from Marshall, it was just
a matter of time as far as the Wildcats
were concerned.

“It really doesn’t surprise ‘me,”
Mark Donnelly said in a postgame
interview...

For starters

After experimenting with various °

line-ups during the preseason and exhi-
bition contests, McKillop used the same
starting group in the Wildcats’ first two
games.

Last year’s starting backcourt pair,
junior Ali Ton and Donnelly, maintain
their posts.

Kosmalski and Marshall join
redshirt junior Ben Ebong to give
Davidson a big frontcourt.

New look

The Wildcats are sporting new
uniforms this year.’

The home whites feature a red
trim on the shorts that showcase a white
Wildcat paw. The shirts also have ared’
trim.

The block-lettered Davidson isred
with a black border.

The numbers; also red but without
the black boarder, are sewed on.

The road uniforms have the iden-
tical design, only reversed — the 'pri-
mary color is red; the trim and lettering
is white.

The uniforms are complementary

Mark Donnelly paced

Davidson with 18 points.
“I didn’t get many

and the coaches made the point to give:me shots
today,” Donnelly said. “The guys did a great job of
creating opportunities for me.”

The bench, led by David Burns’ 15, contributed

33 points.

“The play of the bench was a plus for us today,”
coach Bob McKillop said. “That wasn’t there for us
against Duke and for us to be successful this year, we
need solid play from the bench.”

Guards Davour Halbauer and Billy Armstrong
scored nine and seven points respectively off the

bench.

The Wildcats, who committed 38 turnovers in
Thursday’s loss, committed just 10 yesterday.

_minutes.”

One of the few bright spots for
Davidson was the play of Marshall,
who had a career night with 20 points
and 14 rebounds — nine of which were
offensive.

Landry Kosmalski and Donnelly
tallied 11 and 10 points, respectively.

Point guard Ali Ton added six
points, 11 assists, and nine rebounds in
the losing effort.

But as far as Krzyzewski was con-
cerned, the lopsided final spread in no
way conveyed the nature of the game as
a whole.

“IT. can’t believe we won by that
much,” he said.

“Davidson is good, I mean really
good. That was a battle.

“They’re well-schogled in their

“ system and so well-coached. And they

play really hard.

“Tf you say we play hard like them,
that’s a compliment.”

Still, though, such kind words of-
fered little solace for McKillop, whose
team legitimately thought it could win
this game but ran into a freight train
chock-full of depth and talent.

Duke closed the contest with.a 43-
16 run.

“I’m not feeling too good right
now,” McKillop said.

Women drop disappointing pair in Michigan

By MIcnHaAcL J. KRusE

Everybody off the bandwagon.

Coming off its unexpected and
promising season-opening two-point
loss at No.
1 0
Vanderbilt,
eased Pana
women’s
basketball
team
dropped to
the other
end of the
spectrum this weekend, losing bothcon-
tests on a two-game Michigan road
swing.

The Wildcats fell 86-79 to Central
Michigan Saturday at Mount Pleasant,
as the host Chippewas jumped out to a
nine-point halftime lead and held on in
the second half to move to: 2-0 on the
season.

Five Wildcats scored in double
figures, led by forward Jessica

-Montrella’s 18. Point guard Jen O’ Brien

added 15 points, four rebounds, three
assists, and two steals.

Katy Kamp and_ Jennie
Vanlerberghe, Michigan natives for
whom the trip was a homecoming of
sorts, contributed 11 and 10 points,
respectively.

Kerry Brown notched 10 points .

Although limited to five points,
Jamie Brown had a team-high eight
boards.

On Sunday, the squad did the un-
thinkable, losing to Division II Saginaw
Valley St., which competes in the Great
Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Confer-
ence.

And it waSn’t even close — the
Lady Cardinals, playing in front of 125
undoubtedly rabid fans, bested the Wild-
cats by 35 ina shocking 87-52 rout.

Saginaw Valley’ s Angie Peterson
personally outscored the Wildcats in

the first half, notching 21 points to the
Wildcats’ 18. The score at half was 46-
18, and it didn’t get much better there-
after for the Wildcats, as the Lady Car-
dinals coasted to a perfect 4-0 mark.

Peterson finished with 30. Karen
Deurloo and Jamie Pewinski scored 16
and 11 points, respectively.

For the {Wildcats, the stat sheet
told the sad story: Davidson had only
séven assists, 27 turnovers, shot a dis-
mal .346 from the field and .300 on
three-pointers, and was outrebounded
43-33.

Saginaw Valley, which shot .525
from the floor and a torrid .478 from
three, converted those 27 Wildcat mis-
cues into 39 points.

Only O’Brien cracked double fig-
ures for Davidson, scoring a dozen.
Kerry Brown’s two assists led the team.

Now 0-3, the squad —surely road-
weary — must regroup in time to take

‘on College of Charleston Saturday at

Belk Arena in its home opener.

1, Jr., F, 10.5 ppg, 5.6 rpg); Danielle

Noting the Lady Yellow Jackets:

appearance in the NCAA was during
the 1992-93 season ... alumna Kisha
Fordis playinginthe WNBA... behind
Vanderbilt, Tech represents the
toughest challenge to the Wildcats

rival, needs 257
points to become the
