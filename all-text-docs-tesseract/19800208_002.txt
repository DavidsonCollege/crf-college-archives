‘Our families keep wanting to do things

By GLENN KELLUM

The inflation rate, currently over
13%, is financially strangling profess-
ors. According to a recent report by the
Davidson Chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(AAUP), “‘Davidson’s mean faculty
salary figure is about $800 less than the
average household income in| Mecklen-
burg County.”’ Because of the present
salary situation many professors have
found it necessary to seek ways to ease
their financial state.

By and large, the most common
attempt to solve the problem is a
two-income household. The AAUP re-
port notes that over 50% of all faculty
spouses at Davidson work full-time.
Psychology Professor John Kello said
that some,of the younger faculty
members are paying up to $500 per
month on home loans. ‘‘You can’t do
that on one salary,’’ Kello said. ° *

However, some professors who have’
already bought a house feel that another
income is only an additional benefit, not
a necessity. ‘‘What defines necessity?”
askéd Physics Professor Locke White.

The search for a house is certainly a
contributing factor to the crunch on a
professor’s income. A few years ago

with relatively low interest rates. ‘““They
were lucky,” noted Kello. Now, the price
of houses goes up faster than the
salaries. Instead of getting closer to
buying a house, professors find that
homes are more difficult to afford each
year, Kello said.

According to Sociology Professor
Robert Myers, ‘It’s not possible for
professors to buy even average middle
class American homes on one salary.”’
Physics Professor Robert Manning add-
ed that it is getting ‘‘prohibitively
expensive to buy a house.” Although the
cries are loud, others seem to be content.
“I’m a notorious tight wad, and by
pinching a while back, I’m in no problem
now,” White said. ‘‘My house is paid
for, so there’s no problem there. I don’t
have near as much trouble as the
younger fellows,’’ White added.

Another solution to the problem is
professors themselves finding additional
jobs. Most documented cases are those
where professors seek other employment
during the summer in order to make ends
meet. ‘‘There’s a great demand for
money. Our families keep wanting to do
things like eat,’’ Manning said. Also,
there is a new push by the College for

‘professors to do more research. ‘‘I would

like to have my summers free for
research, but I have to find additional

ways to supplement my income. I'm

pulled in two directions,’’ Manning
ded.

praises may also feel they would be

better off in another profession that pays

better. ‘Yes, some professors do think of

this as a possibility,” Kello said. ‘‘It’s

"not that we want to make more money,

only maintain a reasonable standard of
living,” Kello noted. Myers said that
professors are “‘acutely aware of other
possibilities. You don’t go into teaching
expecting to be left behind economically
We just don’t want to be left behind.
“It’s not a question of whether we want
to buy that new car next year, but rather
of just ‘making it,” Kello said.
Although another profession might
prove to be more lucrative, “darn few
have left here to go teach elsewhere or do
something else,’ White said. A factor
that keeps professors at Davidson may
be the difficulty in beginning another
career. ‘‘You can't go back to school to
be re-trained for another field, not with a
family, and mortgage payments,”
Myers said. ‘‘You’re trained as an
academic, and that isn’t good prepara-
tion for lots of fields,’’ White said.
With current low salaries in the
teaching field, those students just out of
graduate school will have to ‘‘think long
and hard about a choice between

like eat’

industry, for example, and teaching,”
Kello said. Those that choose teachin,
‘‘must have a strong commitment,”
Kello added. ae

Myers noted the ‘rewards of teaching
are the same as always: learning,
knowledge, students. The rewards ang
not in anything about paying your rent,
though.” ,

“The financial picture is grim,” Myers
said, ‘even though Davidson is the best
place to be financially compared with |
schools like ours.” Large state universit.
ies are ahead of private schools like
Davidson in terms of faculty compensa.
tion, but they too lag behind the
galloping inflation rate. ‘‘Only in terms
of salaries would it be better to be at
those large universities,”’ Myers said.

The, acute salary problems have
“contributed to some morale problems,”
Kello said. ‘‘There doesn’t seem to be
any light at the end of the tunnel,” Kello
added. ‘‘What if you've got three or four
kids; what do you do? What happens
when the washing machine breaks down?
What are you going to do? Davidson
salaries are just not adequate,” conclud-
ed Kello.

“We're not mad and waving picket
signs,’ said Manning. ‘‘We just want to
talk with the Trustees and avoid any
confrontation.”’

Plans for retirement

community shelved

By MARVIN OVERBY

The proposed Davidson Re-
tirement Community project,
while not dead, has been at least
temporarily shelved, according
to Davidson College Business
Manager Robert Currie, a mem-
ber of the project committee
(DRCC).

The Davidson Retirement

. Community was an idea origin-

ally initiated in 1978 by David-
son Senior Services, Inc., a
local organization concerned
with senior citizens, which en-
visaged construction of.a facil-
ity to serve the entire Davidson
area. It would include grouped
apartments, a central dining
room, a nursing unit and lounge
areas.

' College President Samuel
Spencer, also a member of the
project committee, contacted
Chester Prentiss of Prentiss
Associates to draw up prelim-
inary plans for the community.

The College Trustees, after

consultation with the Finance
Committee, agreed to give the

DRCC an option on 30 acres of

College owned property located
on Concord Road.

_ Over the period of time-that
Prentiss was drawing up his
plans, both construction costs

Currie estimates the cost of
the project to be in the $5
million range, and says that

fessors and aged friends of the
College, Davidson does not
have the financial resources to
help subsidize the venture.

Although the project has
broad support among commun-
ity members, unless the econ-
omy improves, the outlook is
less than good. The DRCC is
working to keep interest in the
endeavor alive by maintaining
contact with Prentiss
Associates and accepting bids
from other companies, Currie
said, To date, however, nothing
tried has provided a way around
the economic barriers.

being presented to the Board of
Trustees at their February 22
meeting. Spencer emphasized
that the final decision is the
Trustees’. _

In his statement Spencer
stressed the need for fiscal
restraint to ensure a ‘‘sound and
stable financial condition’’ in
the future. He pointed out that
every 1% increase in compensa-
tion costs $55,000 and that
there will be other increases
next year, including a $60,000
minimum rise in energy costs.

Spencer said most of the
money to cover the faculty
increase must.come from an
increase in income because
“most of the expense budget
represents fixed expenditures.

Since endowment and gift
income could not provide

Faculty Salaries

enough to cover the increase,
there had to be an increase in
student fees.

The $575 total increase, the
largest ever made at Davidson,
leaves the cost of Davidson

“‘well below the independent

colleges of the East, somewhat
below Duke, somewhat ahead of
Furman and Wake Forest, and
far ahead of Chapel Hill,’’
Spencer said, emphasizing, ‘‘we
certainly do not want to become
a college which only the privi-
leged can afford to attend.”

Faculty reaction to Spencer’s
proposal was mixed. One pro-
fessor claimed that since the
average compensation increase
would, be 10%, and inflation is
running 12-13%, it was actually
a “salary decrease.”

Religion Professor Max

Polley said, ‘‘I am very pleased.
I think the President took a
significant step in the right
direction.”

“It is a beginning of the
recovery of what we've lost
since 1966,” Polley said.

However, he pointed out that
“the real call is for increased
endowment. A tuition increase
is a quick way to raise money,
but that is hand to mouth,
because the next year you have
the same problem again: But
increasing endowment is not
easy and it takes time.”

History Professor David Shi
called the proposal ‘‘a very:
positive step.’’ Religion Pro-
fessor Michael Root said he had
‘mixed feelings about the in-
crease. It’s not enough.to keep
up with inflation, that’s clear.”
