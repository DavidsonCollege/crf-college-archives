Faculty guest column

Twain criticizes “Cen tennialism’ F

By RANDY F. NELSON
Professor of English

{This is the conclusion of a two-part
series on Mark Twain and the Bicen-
tennial prepared for The Davidsonian
by Mr. Nelson. ]

The major event of the national
celebrations was the Centennial Ex-
position of Philadelphia, which open-
ed on May 10, 1876. On 236 acres in
Fairmount Park were some 200
buildings from 49 nations and 26
states (the only one remaining is now
the Pennsylvania Museum of Art(.
The exposition was actually a world’s
fair devoted to technology: there were
in fact no carnival rides and no
amusements. Before the exhibits
closed on November 10 of the same
year, nearly ten million guests paid
the outrageous admission charge of
fifty cents each.

But when the gates opened that
May, Mark Twain was not in the
crowd. He had lectured in Phila-
delphia in the winter of 1875-76, and
he had convinced himself that he had
been chated by a now-anonymous
theatre manager. It was a grudge
he bore against the whole city for
months. But he did mail in a speech
on Francis Lightfoot Lee.

In 1976 Twain was busy with his
pen, frequently immortalizing opin-
ions that were courageous or reckless
depending on one’s point of view. His
overwhelming political concern from
the publication of his first editorials
down to the explosive diatribes of his
last years was the possession of power

by the ignorant, the corrupt, and the
incompetent. He had a lifelong detes-
tation of Congress based on all
three: ‘‘To my mind Judas Iscariot
was nothing but a low, mean,
premature Congressman,”’ this pub-
lished in the New York Tribune in
1973. And he had an equally fervid
hatred for religious hypocrisy: ‘‘If
Christ were here now, there is one
thing he would not be—a Christian,”
this in the notebook of 1897.

In the year of the Centennial,
Clemens had already built a broad
literary reputation based largely on
the Jumping Frog story, The Inno-
cents Abroad, Roughing It, and The
Gilded Age. A balky business partner
delayed publication of his latest effort
in 1976, and it was not until
December that The Adventures of

Tom Sawyer appeared on the market.

In the summer of that year he had
started on a sequel; but his tank ‘‘ran
dry’’, and he had pigeonholed the
manuscript. It was almost a decade
later that he finally finished: the book
was Huckleberry Finn._

Unscrupulous Canadian publishers
pirated the text of Tom Sawyer and |
without paying royalties stole much
of the American market from
Clemens. In fact, in 1877 the book
which contributed most to the au-
thor’s income had blank pages: it was
a scrapbook, with adhesive already on
the pages, which Twain had invented
and patented earlier.

Nevertheless, for the nearly forty
years between 1872 and his death in

1910 Mark Twain was the most
perceptive student of the American
spirit, as well as its severest critic. ‘‘It
is by the grace of God,” he said, ‘‘that
in our country we have three unspeak-

ably precious things: freedom of:

speech, freedom of conscience, and
the prudence never to exercise either
of them.” To Mark Twain the spirit of
1876 was merely the accumulated

‘particulars of our national heritage,

both noble and base. To celebrate the
noble while ignoring the base called
for a naivete that he could not abide.
In 1898 he wrote in his notebook,
‘Truth is mighty and will prevail.
There is nothing the matter with
this, except that it ain’t so.”

. Howells called his friend the
Lincoln of our literature, perhaps

understanding instinctively that |

whereas the great issue of the 1770's
concerned oppression of one society
by another, Samuel Clemens took for
his theme the oppression of the
individual by society in general. He
was a guardian of individual freedoms
we could ill afford to lise in 1910, an
Uncle Sam we miss most in the
Bicentennial years. Gently familiarity
and acid expression were the hall-
marks of the stern advice he aimed at
future examiners of the multiple
spirits of "76. On December 30, 1900,
he published the following ‘‘Greeting
from the Nineteenth to the Twentieth
Century” in the New York Herald:

T bring you the stately nation of
Christendom returning bedraggled,
besmirched, and dishonored from

Rev. Seeker reveals gift sources

By REV. HYDEN SEEKER

(Move over, Woodward and Bern-
stein, this reporter has pulled the
biggest scoop since King Kong
visited Baskin-Robbins.)

Davidson College's recent gift of $1
million was a payment of a gambling
debt accrued ‘through the gambling
practices of the school’s highest-rank-
ing officials, The Davidsonian learned
yesterday.

According to high-placed adminis-

tration sources, the practices involved .

an all-night poker game during a
recent Board of Visitors weekend at
the home of Davidson President
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr.
Implicated in the gambling activ-
ities were Spencer, Academic Vice-
_ President Zimmerman, Trustee
Chairman Warner Hall, Athletic Dir-
ector Thom Cartmill, Wildcat Club
Executive Director Sandy Carnegie,
and the anonymous donor, according
to the sources.

‘‘These games occur pretty fre-
quently and the stakes can get pretty
high,’’ said the source. “In one game
last year, Spencer wanted to wager
the DCPC.

“When everybody is on and the

potential donor is off, it works out
great. But suppose Cartmill or Carn-
egie are on a bad streak—why do you
think the athletic department is
$110,000 in the red?” the source said.

The Davidsonian confirmed the
reports from sources within the home
of the so-called donors. Sources there
released to The Davidsonian via this
reporter verbatim transcripts of con-
versation regarding the ‘‘donation.”’

Mrs $—You haven’t been loaning
any more money to Bert Lance, have
you?

Mr. $—Oh, no dear, I wouldn’t do
that. Uh...(pause)...you know those
meetings I go to at Davidson?

Mrs. $— You mean the ones where
you don’t get back until all hours of
the morning? Yes,.I know. Go on.

Mr, $—Well, uh...(pause)...after
the meetings Thom and Warner and

“some of the guys usually meet over at
Sam’s for a few hands of friendly
poker and—

Mrs. $—Look, I’ve told you a
hundred times not to gamble with
those guys from the college. Their
whole lot in life is getting money from
people.

Mr. $—But dear, I was doing so
well, I had Sandy down so far that 1

Qwas new, ..

owned half of the Wildcat Club funds.
And Sam and Warner were in tears I
was beating them so bad.

Mrs. $—Why’s that?

Mr. $—The two of them thought I

was bluffing when I was holding a _

straight flush and I won half of the
Living Endowment and the Chambers
Building. I tell you, I was cleaning up
and then (sound of cubes of ice in
glass) ‘Pretty Boy’”’ came along.

Mrs. $— Who?

Mr. $—‘‘Pretty Boy”’ Price Zipper-
man, or Zittermatz, or something like
that. The guys all said he was new
and asked if it would be all right for
him to sit in a few hands. Yeah, he
.and a shark, too:

Mrs. $—You mean to tell me you

‘got hustled by some new guy?

Mr. $—I couldn’t help myself. If
you could have only seen him sitting
across the table from me with his
skinny little tie, and starched shirt,
and smirky little look on his face. I’ve
never seen anybody look so vulner-
able. But lemmetellya, he is a shifty
character who can really wheel ’n’
deal. (Pause) Well, honey, I hope
you'll forgive me, because I wound up
having to make a little donation—like
$1 million.

Mrs. $— What! A million? Well, at
least now I hope you've learned your
lesson.

Mr. $—Then you forgive me?

Mrs. $-—- Just promise you won’t
gamble with those Davidson guys
again.

Mr. $— You bet, dear. I mean, I
promise.

" iti BAG
Mark Twain on Bicentennial Issues

On Feminism:

“We easily perceive that the
peoples furtherest removed from
civilization are the ones where
equality between man and woman
are furthest apart—and we consi-
der this a sign of savagery"’
(Notebook).

On Indians:

“The original reason for Thanks-
giving Day has long ceased to
exist, since the Indians have long
ago been comprehensively and
satisfactorily exterminated and
the account closed with the
Lord..."" (Autobiography, pub-
lished 1924).

On foreign aid:

~ “There is but one thing to do when
a man is wounded and suffering: |
relieve him. If we have a curiosity
to know his nationality, that is a
matter of no consequence and can
wait” (Notebook).

On Christianity: ©
~ “Phe Christian's Bible is a drug-
store. Its contents remain the
same; but the medical practice
changes" (‘Bible Teaching and
Religious Practice,’’ published
1923).

On Dr. Jacques Loeb’s early experi-

ments at Berkley in creating life in a

test tube:
“If you are young, you will, of
course, have to put up, on one side
or the other, for you will not be
able to restrain yourself; but as for
me, Iam old, and I am going to
wait for a new deal’’ (New York
times, 1905).

On business executives:
‘In a sordid slime harmonious,
Greed was born in yonder ditch,
With a longing in his bosom—and
for others’ goods an itch—
As Christ died to make men
holy,
let men die to make us rich—
Our god is marching on” (Battle
Hymn of the Republic Brought
Down to Date, written 19007).

On the American image abroad:

' “Unquestionably the person that
can get lowest down in cringing
before royalty and nobility, and
get most satisfaction out of crawl-
ing on his belly before them is an
American. Not all Americans, but
when an American does it he
makes competition impossible”
(Notebook, 1897).

On a former Secretary of State?

“He was not a direct liar, but he
would subtly convey untruth. He
never dealt in any but large
things, if you let him tell it. If by
accident his trousers got stained
in diverse tints, he would explain
it by no actual lie, yet he would
leave you with the impression that
he got it sliding down a rainbow”’
(Notebook, 1897) -
