The latest undertaking by the Davidson Col-
lege Theatre Department, John Guare’s “Six De-
grees of Separation,” played to five virtually sold-
out crowds between
Wednesday, Oct. 28
and Sunday, Novem-
ber | at Hodson Hall.

end production gave

Although the play was made into a 1993 film
version starring Stockard Channing, Donald
Sutherland, and Will Smith in the lead roles,
Guare’s provocative work has enjoyed its greatest
popularity on stage rather than on screen. The

claim.

‘inner visions/outer voices’
a triumph for Prior

By ANNE STANCIL
Staff Writer

On Friday, Nov. 6 and Saturday, Nov. 7, the
Charlotte Symphony Or-
chestra premiered a piece
composed by Davidson's
own Dr. Richard Prior, con-
ductor of the Davidson Sym-
phony and Assistant Profes-
sor of Music. Composed in
1997-1998, the piece, titled
“inner visions/outer voices,”
reflects the influence of
teachers and performers with
whom Prior has worked
throughout his career.

The work is subtitled
“a concerto for orchestra,”
and in Prior’s own words,
“One of the practical con-
siderations when conceiv-
ing this work was to high-
light the different sections
of the. modern symphony
orchestra.” Prior explains
that the piece “explores
musical ideas that often jux-
tapose the different instru-
mental families and presents
melodies that pass between
them.”

Before both perfor-
mances, Prior addressed a
pre-concert crowd about the
piece and its conception. He
explained the principal mu-
sical gestures that run @
throughout the work. Full of
thythmic vitality and rich harmonies, “inner vi-
sions/outer voices” is written in a neo-Romantic
style. Divided into two sections, “the first con-
cerns itself with a somewhat fragmented explora-
tion of the first strand, presenting two stretches of
material hallmarked by descending scale patterns
that pursue the idea of increasing textual density.

Continuing into the second section, “three
sets of contrasting material are heard: a rushing
scale pattern scored predominately in the strings
refers to the descending scale patterns heard in the
opening section of the work; percussive, synco-
pated chords dominated by the horns, and finally,
a lilting section of material scored primarily in the
woodwinds and harp.”

Conductor Fabio Mechetti explained that
preparing anew work is not much different from
preparing an older piece: the conductor tries to
Temain true to the composer’s intentions. He
further explains that with a new piece, it is easier

Dr. Richard Prior

to maintain the composer’ s intent, whereas a piece
with many previous performances carries diverse
interpretations which stray from the original in-
tentions of the composer.

The Davidson au-
dience perhaps recog-
nized passing allusions
to the Concerto for Pi-
ano and Orchestra:
“Phoenix Rising,”
which Prior composed
in 1996 for James
Swisher, a former asso-
ciate professor of music
and Pianist in Residence
at Davidson who tragi-
cally fell victim to can-
cer-in the fall of 1996.
This concerto was pre-
miered in the spring of
1996 by the Davidson
College Symphony Or-
chestra. Approximately
16 minutes long, “inner
visions/outer voices”
was received with thun-
derous applause from
both crowds, each
nearly 4000 strong, at
Charlotte’s Blumenthal
Performing Arts Cen-
ter.

One of the most re-
warding aspects of the
compositional process,
according to Prior, is the
opportunities it provides
tolearn and teach. Both
Prior and his composi-
tion students attended rehearsals of the piece,
during which Prior engaged in dialogue with the
musicians about their individual parts within the
work,

The students also learned a great deal about
the process behind rehearsal, which will be quite
beneficial to them as they attend rehearsals of their
own works.

Witha background in therich choral tradition .

of English Cathedrals, Prior received a Bachelor’s
degree with honors in music from the University
of Leeds; he continued his doctoral studies at the
University of Nottingham.

His compositions have received numerous,
performances in Great Britain; Europe, and the
United States. These compositions include sev-
eral other orchestral pieces, and numerous choral
works. The premiere of “inner visions/outer
voices” was truly the birth of a significant work in

“contemporary symphony repertoire.

Carlyle, respectively), in their downtown fifth
floor apartment. Flan is an art dealer bent upon
making a sale which would be worth two million
dollars. Money preoccupies them until a young
man who calls himself Paul (John Watson) arrives
at their door, claiming to be 1.) wounded, as a
result of a mugging in Central Park, 2.) a friend of
the Kittredge’s children at Harvard, and 3.) (the
least believeable of his fibs) the son of famed
African-American film pioneer Sidney Poitier.

He also entices his hosts by offering them roles as
extras in the film version of “Cats,” produced by
his famous (alleged) father.

In actuality, Paul is a trained con man, driven

_ by a desire to belong with (or at least flirt with)

members of high society. The Kittredges boot
Paul out of their apartment after they wake up to
find that he has patronized a male prostitute in
their home, at which point Paul sets out to pull the
same scheme off again, on some other suspecting
couple. Flan and Ouisa soon learn the truth about
Paul’s background, yet while Flan is embarrassed
to have been deceived, Ouisa can not escape a
feeling of concern and attachment to the young
man. It is this bewildering emotional paradox
around which the play centers; why do we sympa-
thize with Paul, when we know full well that he is
ostensibly the villain in the whole twisted affair?
John Watson mentioned that it was when this
phenomenon was achieved that it meant his job as
the actor had been accomplished.

The play, which ran about 90 minutes in
length, was performed on a stage built at an angle,
tilted towards the audience. The set also featured
a painting meant to represent a two-sided
Kandinsky, one side of the painting depicting
control, and the other, chaos.

Davidson’s production of Guare’s contem-
porary classic met with extraordinary acclaim
from parents and students alike, but mostly the
latter. They found the production to have been
extremely well-conceived and the casting per-
fect. “Six Degrees” was one production that will
not be soon forgotten.
