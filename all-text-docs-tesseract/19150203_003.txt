PEELIMINARIES
HELD JANUARY 25

DEBATE
WERE

Monday night, January 25, the pre-
liminaries for the collegrate debates were
held. In both societies there was exhib-
ited by the debaters a yreat deal of com-
petition and spirit. “The societies were
very well attended and the audience was
appreciative of the efforts of the speakers.

In the Philanthropic society, the
affirmative was debated by Messrs. 1.
Shaw, Rowan, Cooper, Howland, Arro-
wood, and Ormand ; and the negative by
Messrs. Neal, Alexander, “Vhames, M.
Morrison, and J. D. McLeod. Some
exceptionally fine debates were heard.
The judges were Dr. Harding, Dr. Lin
gle, and Dr. Gray. Vhe four who were
chosen to enter the finals were Messrs.
Alexander, Rowan, Neal, and Cooper.

In the Eumenean society the athena
tive was upheld by Messrs. Scott, H.
Smith, Gignilliat, Chambliss, am Bel-
lingrath; the negative was upheld) by
Messrs. Patton, F. W. Price, Perry aad
Hunter. Dr. J. M. Douglas, Dr. Ar-
buckle. and Dr. Sentelle, as judges, sel-
ected to enter the finals, Messrs. Smith,
Chambliss, Patton, and Price.

‘The speeches as a whole were splendid
and did credit to both literary societies.
There will undoubtedly be some debates
well worth hearing in the finals which
will be held in Shearer Hall, February
12. The eight men who were chosen
from the societies will then speak, and
from these the teams and alternates will

be picked.

CAMPLS PICTURE TO

PRESIDENT WILSON

The following extract is taken from
a letter received from the J. P. Bell
Company, of Lynchburg, Va.:

‘Te will be of interest to you to learn
that recently our photographer made a
considerable enlargement of one of the
views of Davidson College and sent it
to President Wilscn. Mr. Wilson was
pleased to acknowledge the picture in
terms of appreciation, stating that it re-
called to him many happy days.”

President Wilson has many times
shown that he has many pleasant mem-
ories of the days spent at Davidson.
