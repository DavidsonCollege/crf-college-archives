Davidson mashes Springfield 42-14; offense rolls up 565 yards

_ By VAN BECK
_ Staff Writer,
Davidson’s offensive unit re-
assumed its explosive pattern of
a year ago, but defense was the
key as-the Wildcats opened
their 1980 campaign by thrash-
ing Springfield 42-14 at Rich-
ardson Field this past Satur-
day. The offense, paced by
quarterback Brian Whitmire,
rolled up 565 yards total offense
while a strong Cat defense held
the visitors scoreless until the
fourth quarter, long after the

outcome had been decided.

The defense was a much
maligned unit a-year ago and
had been a definite question
mark for Coach Ed Farrell prior
to the season opener. Satur-
day’s performance, particularly
in the first half, dispelled any
negative references to last year
however, as Davidson limited
Springfield to just over 120
yards total offense before inter-
mission and controlled the scri-
mmage line from the opening
minutes.

And most importantly, Dav-
idsori-didn’t give up the “‘big
play” and/or long gainer, both ¢
of which were nearly second

- nature by season’s end a year

ago when several defensive
starters were out of. action.
Farrell commented, ‘‘I was
pleased with our offensive ex-
plosiveness and our defensive
pursuit. Overall the defense did
a great job.”

Davidson was tested early
when a bad snap for an intended
punt turned the ball over to

Tight end James Jones runs for a long gainer.

. Springfield at the Cats 29 yard
line. The defense stiffened how-

ever, and held the Chiefs to six
yards on four plays. Lightning
then struck in the form of
Gifford Piercy, who hauled in a
Whitmire pass and outsprinted
the defenders to paydirt. The
play went for 74 yards and gave
the Cats a 7-0 lead after Gary
Sims booted the PAT.

Springfield made only one
first down in the first quarter.

On Davidson's initial posses-
sion of the second quarter,
Whitmire engineered a seven-
play, 80 yard drive for a 14-0
lead. Tight end James Jones
spearheaded the drive with two
receptions for 60 yards while
Ray Sinclair picked up the score
by bulling in from the two yard
line. Sims’ PAT was good once
again. After forcing a Spring-
field punt, the Wildcats went 53
yards in seven plays, a drive
culminated by halfback Mickey
Dillon’s 17 yard reception of a
Whitmire pass. After Sims’
extra point, Davidson led 21-0
with six minutes remaining
until half.

The visiting Chiefs were
forced to punt for the fifth time
on their next possession. Dav-
idson capitalized on good field
position, and drove quickly for
its fourth touchdown of the half
and third of the second quarter.
Fullback Ray Sinclair galloped
the final 25 after breaking away
at the line of scrimmage.
Springfield then mounted its
only drive of the half to David-
son’s 22 yard line, but a ‘‘rubber
band”’ Cat defense held at that
point.

With time running out, Ray
Sinclair burst 19 yards on a
draw play and rather than run
the clock out with eight seconds
showing Farrell went for the

¢

score. Enter Gifford Piercy once
again. Piercy, a senior split end
who ranked fifth nationally a
year ago, ended the half as he
began it by making spectacular
grab of Whitmire’s pass and
waltzing into the endzone. The
half ended with the Wildcats
leading 35-0 and little doubt
remaining as to the final out-
come.

Liberal substitutions charac-
terized much of the Davidson’s
second half effort, most noti-
cably in the fourth quarter. The
only third quarter score for
either team came when Ray
Sinclair scored his third touch-
down of the afternoon from
eleven yards out. Both Spring- .
field scores came in the final
quarter, the first two minutes
into the quarter and the latter
with 17 seconds remaining.

Individually, several Wild-
cats stood out. Whitmire com-
pleted 12 of 19 passes for 284
yards and three touchdowns,
Ray Sinclair rushed for 141
yards on 20 carries and three
scores, Piercy grabbed four
passes for 162 yards and two
touchdowns and James Jones
also caught four for 101 y ;
all in all, a very strong offensive

-showing.

Fullback Alvin Atkinson,
Davidson’s career scoring lead-
er, played sparingly because of
knee problems and is doubtful
for next week.

The defense answered several
questions which have been of
great concern since last fall;
notably, would Davidson give

,up the ‘‘big play”’ and would the

Cats be handled by the opposi-
tion in the form of sustained
drives? If the Springfield con-
test is any indication, the
answer to both is an emphatic

“6 ”

no .

Wildcat obstacles for 1980: Questionable defense, tough schedule

By VAN BECK
Staff Writer

The 1980 edition of Davidson
Football will be the most talent-
ed in Coach Ed Farrell’s seven
year tenure as head coach and
should improve on the 6-4
record of a year ago.

Farrell commented, ‘‘This is
the finest team, material-wise,
that I’ve been associated with
since coming to Davidson, but
our schedule is also the tough-
est. We anticipate the season
with somewhat higher hopes,
but flowery predictions at this
point are impossible.” The sea-
sonal outlook therefore seems to
be one'‘of high expectations
tempered slightly by a demand-
ing schedule.”''~

On paper the offense possess-
es as much or more firepower
than a year ago when the ’Cats
scored 33 points or more on
seven occasions, 40 or more four
times and tallied 55 in a losing
cause. The skilled positions

show only one loss to gradua- -

tion, that being halfback Craig
Pyles who was an excellent
blocker. Everyone else returns
including quarterback Brian
Whitmire. Whitmire passed for
635 yards and six touchdowns

last season while sharing the
quarterback duties with since
-departed Al Rhyne.

The backfield will be manned
by All-American candidate Al-
vin Atkinson at one halfback,

provided his injured knee heals,

Ray Sinclair at fullback and
Mickey Dillon at the other
halfback position. Atkinson is
the Davidson career scoring
leader and begins the season
only 118 yards away from the
career rushing record, but he is
still hampered by an injured
knee. Sinclair led the team in
rushing a year ago and reported
to summer camp this year in the
best shape of his life. Dillon,
an extremely quick and strong
back, will also handle the punt
return duties. If Atkinson’s
knee does not come around, his
slot will fall into the hands of
sophomore Leonard Walker or
freshman Bob Miller.

Gifford Piercy, who returns
at wide receiver, ranks among
the nation’s finest receivers. He
finished fifth nationally. last
season with 43 receptions and
eight touchdowns. James Jones
should ably man the tight end

‘ slot. c

The offensive interior line

\

does not boast great size, but
quickness and experience are
definite assets. Pat Pope, a 6’
3’’ 215 pound senior who anch-
ors the line at one guard, will be
a principal reason for the suc-
cess of Whitmire, Atkinson,
and company, while Senior
Dave Nichols will hold down the
other guard slot. Following a
preseason position switch,
hard-hitter Jeff Kane has emer-
ged as the starting center.
Slated for starting assignments
at tackle are Mitch Shirley and
Dan Klinar. The line will hold
the key to a balanced ground
and air attack, a must if the
’Cats hope to control some of
the more physical teams on the
schedule. ~

The defense, an oft Latigned
unit a year ago, holds the key to
a successful season. The defense
may have received a “bad rap”
however, because injuries re-
duced the number of original
starters on the squad to two by
the time of the Wofford game.
The “outlook seems much
brighter for 1980; size and
strength characterize the inter-
ior positions while the backfield
is composed of quick and heady
athletes.

Co-Captain Pat Sheridan will
spearhead the line from his
defensive end position. Sheri-
dan, one of the squad’s most
competitive members, is com-
ing off a shoulder injury but is
performing at a 100% level
now. Wendell Washington, a 6’
2’’ 280 pound freshman, could
possibly start at left tackle with
Senior Steve Lowe slated for a
Starting berth at right tackle.
Svend Pederson holds down
middle guard and Joe Palasak
will open at right end. Charles
Hooks will be a top reserve. The
strong interior line averages 228
pounds and should be able to
stifle opposing running attacks.

James McLain and Atmire
Bailey claim the starting line-
backer slots. McLain missed
spring drills with an injured
hand, but the 6’ 3” 200 pound
junior is a quick and hard-hit-
ting player who started as a
sophomore. Bailey, at 6’ 200
pounds, is extremely strong and
possesses good speed. He play-
ed fullback as a freshman and
noseguard ‘as a sophomore
which illustrates his versatility.

Few opposing receivers will
outsprint or outmaneuver the
Wildcat defensive secondary

this fall as excellent athletes
populate each position. Senior
Kevin Hanna, a legitimate All-
American prospect, anchors the
backfield. Hanna claimed four
interceptions a year ago from
his counerback position and
rates a8 Davidson's best cover-
age man. Juniors Bill Price and
Andre Kennebrew are slated for
starting action at free safety
and strong safety respectively.
Sophomore Kendrick Williams
gets the nod for the other
cornerback post. Taking into
consideration the athletic abili-
ty of these four, the threat of
the long gainer should be mini-
mal

Wayne Paymer should handle
the placekicking and punting
duties with backup Gary Sims
slated to see action. Paymer has
ranked among NCAA Division
1-AA punting leaders over the
past two years and carries a
career average of 40.4 yards per
punt into his junior season.

The schedule loo:ns extreme-
ly difficult. The opposition in-
cludes three Division 1-A oppo-

‘nents, Boston University, Fur-

man and The Citadel, and Three
Division 1-AA teams, Lafay-
ette. Bucknell, and Lehigh.
