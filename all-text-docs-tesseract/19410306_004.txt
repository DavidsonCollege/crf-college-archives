Pi Kapps Champions

Baseball, Track Begin

Spring sports, unable to jump the season because of bad
weather and other conflicts, were off, nevertheless to a timely
start in this the first week of spring. Brightest prospects for
the Cats in the coming months seem to be with the track out-
fit. Coach Whittle has nine “D” men back along we host
of sophs from last year’s better-than-average trosh squad.

cindermen open on April 5 against U. S. C. at Columbia
and end the season with the Conference meet at Williamsburg
on May 17, idling only one week-end of the interval. The
home meets are with Virginia Tech on April 12, and Furman
May 10. The Cats are well fortified in the dashes, hurdles and
field events, but are seriously lacking in the distances.

On the diamond the tale is different. Only one of the re-
turning twirlers is lettered and the reserve ranks from last
season are thin. :

Bone Reinhardt, only port sider available, may lose part of
the season because of a bad finger. This leaves the hurling
chores to Ed Lucas, a starter last year, and Johnny Frederick,
mainstay of last season’s frosh. The infield returns intact,
Hogg at third, Owens at short (in case a tinger injury doesn’t
bench him), Yarborough at second, and Niven or Carter at
first. In the Gardens no spot has been cinched.

The linksmen with lettermen Sharpe and Abels returning,
should see a fairly successful season, enlivened by several road
trips.

eAoilure of Billy Turner and Gene Sutton to return to school
leaves the burden of the court campaigning to Captain. Dick
Shore and Miller Sproull. The other four positions are wide
open.

Conference Sidelights—

Action on the Southern Conterence front has been lively dur-
ing the past week with three schools winning top honors in as
many sports.

Washington and Lee grabbed wrestling honors from the re-
maining loop members by winning four individual titles as well
as the team top spot. Davidson shared fourth place with Duke,
behind the Generals, V. M. I. and Carolina. Jack Abels, winner
of two matches, was forced to default in the finals and lose his
chance at a circuit crown because of an injured shoulder.

In boxing, dark horse Citadel’s Light Brigade won only one
finals match but piled up enough points along the way to take
the cake Saturday night. Warren Wilson, rejected by. the
ROTC department of Clemson because of surplus fat, landed a
haymaker on one time Navy champion Gates Kimball, North
Carolina heavy in the feature match of the night. Wilson, out-
pointed in two rounds, slipped in his right after thirty seconds
of the third to win by a K. O. The Clemson heavyweight in-
tends to box professionally to support his wite, and is being
mentioned as a possible “white hope” in the ‘next few years.

Duke’s Blue Devils after a hard first rond encounter with
Carolina breezed through the basketball tourney in Raleigh,
closing with a rout at South Carolina’s expense, placing Chuck
Holly and Cy Valasek on the Associated Press All-tournament
five.

Home Again— .

With the call for spring sports already out, basketball, with
its reign challenged, is a dead game for another eight months,
but the obituaries are on hand. The Wildcats had a rather
mediocre season as shown by the statistics. In Southern Con-
ference standings the Cats were tenth, ahead of State, V. P. 1,
Furman, Citadel and Maryland, with five wins and seven loss-
es. Their conference foes scored 541 points against them while
they totaled 478. Including non-circuit engagementsythe felines
were slightly better off. In 23 games they won 11, scoring 823
points to their opponents 735. Jim Hogg led the Dayidson in-
dividual tallying with 340 points, 182 of them in conference
games. This puts the Cat captain in fourth place in loop scor-
ing, only one point behind Westmoreland who was in 15 games
to Hogg’s 12. Other. high point Davidsonians were Frederick
with a season total of 131 and Belk, 118. ;

With four weeks of hard drills over, the gridders have only
one more stretch to serve. The practice will close with a Black
vs. Red squad game,on Saturday afternoon. Each of the three
games already played have ended in ties, with neither team
showing any. great defensive strength. Frosh talent has come
through in a pleasing manner and even the pessimistic coach-
ing staff is looking for a riper win column in the ’41 season.

| HEAD GRAPPLER |

Jack Abels, a senior from High Point, last week reached the finals
in the Southern ‘erence wrestling tournament. Abels won his
flret two matches in the tournament and had to forfeit his finals
match of an injury. He fought in the 135 pound class and was
captain of the 1941 team. :

Matmen Take
Fourth Place

Sending five men into the semi-
finals, the Davidson varsity wres-
tling team tied with the Duke grap-
plers for fourth place in the South-
ern Conference tournament held at >
College Park, Maryland last week-
end. Washington and Lee took
the top honors.

The Cat team was greatly handi-
capped when their expert captain,
Jack Abels, had to forfeit his finals
match because of a shoulder injury:
Abels had won two tournament
battles and had a good chance at
the 136 pound title. Four Cats,
Knox, Browning,. Turnage, and
Hipp, drew byes in the preliminaries.

In a match with VMI before the
tournament the Virginians beat the
Cats 18 to 6. Hipp and Abels were
the lone victors for the Davidsons.
