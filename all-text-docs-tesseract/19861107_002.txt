Stress interferes with women’s lifestyles

_ By ED MATTHEWS

A lack of identity causes much
of the stress experienced by
women in the United States today,
said psychologist Daphne Tim-
‘mons in the 900 Room on
Wednesday.

“Without an awareness of
themselves as individuals, women
are left with an absence of sub-
stance which leads to depression.”

Timmons, a practicing psy-
chologist in Charlotte and mem-
ber of the Charlotte Psychological
Association, spoke-to a crowd of
100 students and faculty.

“Without -an identity,”
said, “you don’t have much cae:
over your life. You have to. know
what your needs are and then de-

fine them clearly. So many
women are trying to create an
identity outside while not meeting
internal needs.”

She pointed out that this lack
of identity has become a problem
since the advent: of women’s
rights. Today there is pressure to
be both a homemaker and a career
woman, and to accept the respon-
sibilities of both. “Women think
they should be able to perform
perfectly. When they don’t, when
they aren’t able to balance a job
‘and raise the kids and keep the
house, they feel as if ares have
failed?) : —

She erpinired that share is a
Societal conditioning which has
led women to be so concerned

about others, their children or
their husbands, that they ignore
their own. wants and desires.
“Then they feel out of control and
empty.”

Timmons. said that women
often try to blame their problems
on men. While acknowledging
that women have to work harder to
succeed at the same jobs as men,
she does not allow her patients to
use this as an excuse. “Every
woman has the choice to control
her own life or to be controlled.”

Women. need to balance four’
_ important areas of their lives to

help achieve satisfaction, Tim-
mons noted: the physical self, the
cognitive, the spiritual and the

emotional.

When. women become so
caught up in their work, they sepa-
rate their heads from their bodies,
“which creates many problems
because our bodies give us many
signals about our emotional
health. For Ynstance, stomach
aches are often fear-induced,” she
said.

Another way women can
begin reducing their stress-related
problems is by understanding the
difference between “doing” and
“being.” “We live in the future be-
cause we don’t want the past
creeping back in spoiling things
and end up missing now. The
question, then, is ‘How does one

commitment: What am I commit-
ted to being? Then you identify
your problems so that you can

begin solving them. Just identify- _

ing them does you no good.”

_ “The most important step,”
she asserted, “is to have an action
plan because without it, it is hard
to implement one’s commitment.
Commitment seems to create
energy,” she said, and named
worrying, being in a hurry, fear
and resentment as four states
which waste that energy.

“We create our lives. It’s not
about being a failure, it’s about
learning lessons from problems.”

marked, “You have to define your

Ethics and business make a good combination

By DAVID H. BEARCE

The speaker at this week's
Open Luncheon, sponsored by the
Campus Forum Committee, was
Larry Kirkman, the district man-
ager of Procter & Gamble who
spoke in the 900 Room Wednes-
day, Nov. 5 on “Ethics in Busi-
ness.”

Kirkman defined ethics as
“professional and moral standards
of conduct.” He added that
“people are judged by their peer
group based on the ethics they dis-
play both before and after work.”

People base their judgments of a .

certain business on the basis of the
individuals they come into contact
with, and thus one must always
act in an ethical manner.

Kirkman stated that there are
“alwavs policies that give people
trouble” because company
guidelines “don’t Cqver every as-
pect” of the company’s dealings.
There are often gray areas, not

“covered by company guidelines,
and difficulties arise near these
gray areas.” |

But Kirkman stressed that
“many companies do handle

themselves very well, but you just
don’t tread about it in the newspa-
pers.” He said that most com-
panies do not function ~~ if “the
ends justify the means.” ~~” .”

Next Kirkman addressed the
question of responsibility. Ulti-
mately the upper level manage-
ment is responsible, he said, but
rules do not cover all situation and
the workers must often make their
own decisions. Thus, according to
Kirkman, “all people have the re-
sponsibility to display good ethics
and train others” to do the same.

A moral code “affects both the
social and the business life.” Most
employers are looking for indi-
viduals who are “unwilling to
compromise” this moral code. Ev-
eryone straightens up when they
are being watched, he said, but
“what we do when nobody is look-
ing is the real issue,” according to
Kirkman.

Kirkman defined character as
“what we are.” Reputation is de-
fined as “what others think we

re.” Reputation counts for a lot
and once it is broken “it is very
difficult to mend. We at Procter &

Gamble are very protective of our
reputation.”

Recently there have been
rumors that Procter & Gamble
.was\connected to, the Church of
Satan because of the company’s
logo. Kirkman said these rumors
“were very difficult to quell,” and
Procter & Gamble has “spent
thousands and thousands of dol-
lars.” Now they have decided to
remove the old logo from some of
their products.

Kirkman said there is a con-:

nection between reputation and .

sales. People buy a product ini-
tially because it costs less. But “if
the people know they are getting
value for their money. they will
come back and buy it again. The
reputation of a company is pre-
dicted on the quality of its prod-
ucts.”
Kirkman remarked that Proc-
ter & Gamble voluntarily took

cause of the risk of toxic shock .
syndrome. This has their “worst

quarter in history” but it showed -

Procter & Gamble’s philosophy of

“looking to the long-term.”
Currently Procter & Gamble is
initiating drug testing for its man-
ufacturing personnel because they
are responsible for operating high-
speed machinery. Kirkman said
that drug testing is a “new subject
receiving a lot of attention” and
Procter & Gamble: | is “grappling

. with the issue now.’

Larry Kirkman speaks on business ethics

Kirkman gave advice to senior
who are looking for a company
with integrity. He said “look at the
people.” If they appear ethical

then “the rest of the company is
probably the same way.” The
commitment to their employees is
probably indicative of how they
treat their customers and com-

petifors, according to Kitkman.
