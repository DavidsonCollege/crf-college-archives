Davidson Professor Attends Din-

sociation at Special Invita-
tion of That Body

Richmond, New York, Boston, Phil-
adelphia_ and Baltimore were the
scenes of Davidson College Alumni
meetings during the week of March
11-16, when over 50 per cent of the
former students located in those cities
or adjacent territory came together to
hear about the Davidson of today and
its immediate changes, and to think
and talk Davidson informally. Eight
of the states along the east coast were
represented, and mén from thirty
classes, extending from 1880 to 1930
attended. All of the meetings showed
an unusual amount of enthusiasm for
Davidson, and indicated a keen inter-
est in almost every phase of its activ-
ity.

The proceedings of each meeting fol-
lows:

Richmond

The first gathering Davidson
alumni was at Richmond on Monday,
March 11th, when 29 men were pres-
ent in the dining hall of the Assembly
Training School} where supper was
served. The meeting was presided
over by Rev. W. E. Hill, D.D., 1900,
president. After an election of offi-
cers, the alumni secretary was intro-
duced, and told of the immediate hap-
penings at Davidson and some of the
recent actions of the board of trustees.
Rev. Walter L. Lingle, D.D., ’92, chair-
man of the board of trustees, came in
from Atlanta at the conclusion of the
secretary’s remarks and was asked to
speak to that body. He recapitulated,
to a certain extent, what the secretary
had said, and added a number of oth-
er thoughts on the recent meeting of
the board. Dr. Hill and E. B. Mc-
Gukin, ’22, also talked.

of

New York

At the New York meeting, Wednes-
day, March 13th, 44 alumni, repre-
senting the states of New York, Penn-
sylvania and Connecticut met at the
Fraternity Club for a dinner-meeting.
W. P. Anderson, president, presided,
and when the old officers had been re-
elected, Mr. Anderson introduced Dr.
J. M. McConnell, ’99, of the Davidson
faculty, who had gone to New York at
the special invitation of the New York
association.

Dr. McConnell spoke upon “The Da-
avidson of Tomorrow,” reviewing the
early beginning of the college, with its
subsequent struggles. He told of the
new era which began with Dr. Henry
Louis Smith’s administration, after
which he discussed the future of Da-
vidson, He cited the many advances
which had been made during the past
few years, mentioned the more recent
and outstanding actions of the board
of trustees, and in closing predicted a
future for the college surpassing the
hopes of its alumni, its faculty and its
administrative officers,

Capt. Geo. H. Weems, now stationed
at West Point, spoke to the assembled
alumni and personally extended them
an invitation to attend the Army-Da-
vidson game at West Point next fall.
He assured them of entertainment, and
along with Capt. W. A. Dumas, 15, al-
so at West Point, is going to see that
alumni-are provided for excellent tick-

“ ets and that they enjoy the day. The
secretary also talked to the gathering.

Boston

Most of the 21 alumni attending the
Boston meeting on Thursday, March
14, were students at Harvard, though
two of them came to Boston from
Providence, R, I. Dinner was served
at the Faculty Club at Harvard, and at
the conclusion of this the group ad-
ourned to one of the club rooms where
the secretary spoke informally. W. S.
Woods, ’27, who had made the prelim-
inary arrangements, presided. An
open forum discussion followed, with
almost every man asking questions
about the college. The questions of an
enlarged Davidson library and the fu-
ture of alumni work were discussed.

Philadelphia

Twenty-one men also attended the
Philadelphia meeting at the Southern
Tea Room, Friday, March 15, which
was presided over by J. P. Hendrix,
'25, in charge of arrangements. He in-
troduced the secretary who first asked
for remarks from Dr. R. E. Watkins,
12, who had also been present at the
New York meeting. In the discussion
following the secretary's remarks, the
question of Davidson’s commencement
being changed to a later date was men-
tioned, and a number of questions
asked. No organized association was
attempted at this or the Boston meet-
ing.

Baltimore

Dr. H. C. Davis, ’02, was host to 15
Davidson alumni with a buffet supper
at the Baltimore Club, in Baltimore,
Saturday night, March 16th. A num-
ber of the men attending were new-
comers to the city. After the re-elec-
tion of officers, the secretary talked,
and his remarks were followed by a
discussion of the future of Davidson in

the alumni contributed to the thoughts,
for the majority were either connected
directly or indirectly with educational
institutions or expected to be with
colleges or universities. In the obser-
vations on this page will be found the

Views and Observations | :

Whenever the alumni secretary attends
a series of alumni_meetings, he returns
to Davidson with a bevy of thoughts,
observations and ideas. In the following
paragraphs he is giving expression to a
number of.them:

Davidson College alumni are thinking
more about their Alma Mater and its
future today than ever before. The fact
that Davidson is to have a new president
next year is probably responsible for con-
siderable of this thought, for he, in a
large measure, will determine the ac-
complishments of the college in the years
to come. The rapid-fire questions pro-
pounded in the open forum discussions
in several of the meetings were construc-
tively framed, and were not of idle con-
sequence, but dealt largely with the fu-
ture contributions of Davidson to the
educational world.

Exactly 129 former students of David-
son attended the five alumni meetings,
representing over 50 per cent of the
men who had access to the meetings.
Alumni in eight different states had op-
portunity to attend the gatherings, and
all eight were represented.

The New York meeting was the largest,
with 44 men present, excluding the two
representatives from the college. One
alumnus remarked that it was a tribute

Gukin, Richmond; W. K. McCain and
C. W. Robinson, both of Philadelphia.

to Davidson that s6 many men should
come together for such a meeting. He
stated that he attended the alumni meet-
ings of another institution, which had
several hundred men in New York, but
that they could not get fifty of their
alumni to attend.

It is firmly believed that the presence
of Dr. J. M. McConnell in New York
brought a number of men to the meeting.
Most of the men knew Dr. McConnell
personally, and were glad of the chance
to see and hear him again. The con-
clusion is drawn that every alumni meet-
ing would be more largely attended if
some member of the faculty, known to
the alumni, could attend. The alumni
association finances will not permit this,
but it is believed that it would be worth-
while for the college to appropriate a
fund for this purpose.

The possibility of Davidson being the
“Princeton of the South” was suggested
at the Baltimore meeting, and the opinion
was expressed that there was no reason
why this could not be a reality. Davidson
is already firmly established, its prestige
knows no confines, and the outlook is
bright and hopeful. With renewed alumni
interest the financial side of the college
should be benefited, and with money the
