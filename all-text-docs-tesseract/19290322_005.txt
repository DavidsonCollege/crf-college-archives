BASEBALL SEASON OPENS HERE TODAY

CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Well, we are ready and waiting to
hear Uncle Rube Brandon call the
boys to the plate today. There are lots
of good games, but baseball fills a niche
all of its own, and there is no sound
like the crack of a bat as it lines the
old apple out. These Cadets from Oak
Ridge Institute are not to be taken
lightly. It is seldom that you find a
prep school team good enough to en-
gage a college varsity, but Davidson
never has seen the time when she could
whip Oak Ridge without plenty of
trouble. It will be a good game.

Sort of look for Johnnie McInnis
to take the hill in the opener. John
went great guns last year and was
the team’s mainstay in the box in
addition to being a pretty sure hit-
ter. He should have a big year
again, and with Doc Kugler, Buck
Marrow, “Bull” Meadows, Doc
Henderson and Lefty Thompson to
aid, the Wildcats pitching corps
should rate with the best of them.

Captain Ratchford is another old
salt who is due to click when the bat-
ting averages are figured up. Fred
didn’t hit any too well last season, but
his freshman and sophomere years he
was a slugger from way back. This is
his year to bust ’em again,

Monk seems to ey planning to
send Jimmie Proctor to the outfield
to keep Cap’n Fred and Whiz
Miller company. Proc is too hard
to grace the bench, and if he can
move after those long flies and
bounding grass cutters, he ought to
be right in the outer gardens.

“We see by the papers” startling re-
ports of Duke’s nine man hurling staff,
three of whom are sterling southpaws,
Jenkins, who beat us 2-0 last year,
Belue, and Hawkins. To last year’s
Wildcat nine that would have been de-
spairing. news, for those Cats simply
couldn’t lick a left-hander. It is.anew
tale now, however, and batters who hit
from the port side are mighty scarce
on Monk’s squad. Ratchford, McInnis,
Miller, and Parrish seem to be the
crop.

Some good omens for the com-
ing weeks came to light in the
track meet Saturday. Whittle “Was
right and will be even better when
he has varsity competition. The
same old trouble pops up of get-
ting seconds and thirds in these
distance events. It will be hard
to win big meets without a lot of
these secondary places. Some of”
the boys may round into form and
be good for ’em though.

First meet is not far off.. Cavaliers
from. Virginia*h66k up with the cats
on April 1, we believe it is. Flippen
of Virginia broke the world’s record
on the sixty yard hurdles» up New
York way the other day. He knocked
off one-fifth of a second. So that’s the
kind of competition we’ve got to meet,
is it?

Eddie Brietz, of the Charlotte
Observer, the sports writer down
there who came closest td being a
Davidson booster, is leaving for
bigger fields soon. Our best wishes
go with Eddie.

Everybody on his toes Saturday and
show these high school track men a
big time. Who knows but what there
are future Wildcats in that bunch?
Show ’em what the spirit of Davidson
is.

have and know and are not ambitious to
use each achievement as a stepping stone
to a still greater one.

In closing Mr. Beck brought out very
effectively the following fundamentals on
which a man should shape his career:
First, a plan; second, a purpose; third,
perseverance and finally, a passion for
righteousness. This final point brings
out what Mr. Beck tries to inspire in all
who come under his observation, the im-
portance of integrity and chardcter in
every day life as well as in business.

Midas.”

Edith: “Call me something else. I
don’t know a thing about those Bible
p stories.”

|| Wildcats Primed to

Meet Oak Ridge In

Season’s First Game

Team Eager to Go as Time for
Opener Approaches

MONK OPTIMISTOC

Several Positions Still Undecided
—Cadets Have Usual Strong
Team—Prospects for Wild-
cats Are Good

The erstwhile gloomy coach of David-
son College’s three major sports smiled
slightly when asked today what he
thought of this season’s baseball pros-
pects with the opening game tomorrow,
and replied, “Fairly good.” Coach Young-
er rarely gives utterance to a statement
as optimistic as this, which, interpreted,
meant that he was highly gratified over
the pre-season showing of his candidates.

The Davidson mentor seemed fairly
certain about most of his starting lineup
for the first game of the 1929 season with
Oak Ridge here tomorrow afternoon. His
nine for the coming schedule of games
is shaping up nicely, and only a few
rough spots need the application of the
ironing process.

Third base is still giving Coach Young-
er considerable worry. He has Marks,
Parrish and Proctor cavorting around
that point, and will not be able to de-
cide about his starting player until later
in tHe week. Should his choice lie be-
tween Marks and Parrish, Proctor will
be sent to the outfield, with the right gar-
den as his stamping ground. Proctor will
be in the initial lineup because of his
swatting capacities. “That's certain,”
said Coach Younger. ,

Armfield and Gladstone are fighting it
out behind the-~platter. Gladstone was
substitute receiver for the varsity last
year, and Armfield is a back-stop product
of the yearlings. The odds are in favor
of the latter at the present time, accord-
ing ‘to the authorities. His ability to
handle the delivery of Marrow and
Thompson last season is a strong point
in his favor.

It is seriously doubtful if the only left-
hand twirler in the Wildcat camp will see
mound duty this year. Thompson, a
southpaw, hurt his arm in a game last
summer, and the kinks are still bother-
ing him. He has done little work so
far, it being the hope of the tutor that
he would be in condition to heave later
on if he nursed his sore limb the first
part of the season.

Capt. Ratchford in center, Miller in left-
field, Crawford at first,,Goodson at sec-
ond, and Littlejohn at short appear to
be sure bets as regulars on the Davidson
varsity. The pitching staff of five are
twirling the sphere in daily drill and who
will be called upon as the season’s begin-

ner is not known—either to the coach or

anyone else. The quintet of moundsmen
are McInnis, Kugler, Meadows, Hender-
son and Marrow.

Among others who are bidding strongly
for different positions, according to
Monk Younger, are Covington and Mc-
Callum, The former has been perform-
ing at third and in the outfield, while Mc-
Callum is devoting all of his time out in
the place where the grass grows green.

Jean, aged three, out to tea, was
puzzled when she saw the family bow
their heads for grace.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

“Giving thanks for our daily bread,”
she was told. “Don’t you give thanks
at home, Jean?”

“No, said Jean, “we pray for our

bread.”—Orange and Blue.

WHITTLE. STARS

No Outstanding Records Made—
High Boy Wins Discus Throw
From Collegians With Good
Heave

In the first dual trackmeet of the sea-
son, staged last Saturday, the Davidson
varsity overwhelmed Charlotte High and
the local Freshmen. The varsity rolled
up 114 points, Charlotte got 25 points, and
the Freshmen got eight. The varsity car-
ried off every first place except one, los-
ing the discus throw to Mullis of Char-
lotte.

Whittle, of the Varsity, was high point
man of the meet. He won the 100-yard
dash, the 120-yard high hurdles, and the
220 low hurdles, besides running in the
880-yard relay. He donated fifteen points
to the varsity score.

One of the most spectacular finishes of
the afternoon was staged by Bill McGa-
yock, to take the two-mile from Bill
Beavers. They had dogged each other’s
footsteps for the whole eight laps, McGa-
vock leading most of the way, though
Beavers took the lead from him by a
sprint at the beginning of the eighth lap.
McGavock started sprinting as he came
into the straightaway for the finish, and
it was a battle from there to the tape,
Beavers losing by a small margin.

The time, for most of the events, was
rather slow, due to a wind which offered a
great deal of resistance, and to the early
date at which the meet was staged. Most
of the boys are just now rounding into
shape.

Summary of events:

100-yard dash—Whittle (D. C,), Kell
(D. C.), Jennings (D. C.), McMillan,

Outlook Bright For

Strong Tennis Team

Roddey, Halverstadt, Johnston
Are Letter Men Available for
Team

With their first intercollegiate match
barely more.than one week off, the varsity
tennis is rapidly rounding into
shape for the encounter. After being
handicapped in early season drills by the
inclement weather, the players have taken
full advantage of the ideal conditions dur-
ing the past week to put in some invyalua-
ble practice and most members of the
squad are already handling the racket in
mid-season form, Re

Captain J. T. Roddey, A. N. Halver-.,
stadt, and F. W. Johnston, varsity mem-
bers from last year, are all performing
on the court in speedy form but, as yet,
the fourth player on the team has not
been determined, Bradley, Poe, DeCamp,
and Pettus aré the men vying for this
position. Until the team is completed,
little can be predicted as to the real
strength of the squad.

SC

WADE SMITH

(Continued from page 1)
nounced that his subject was “The Cross.”

Abraham carrying his son to the mountain
in order to offer him up as a sacrifice
represented the birth of Christ yet to
come. As he described the old man plac-
ing Isaac on the altar and binding him
there, Mr. Smith proclaimed the supreme
sacrifice of Christ who died that man
might be redeemed. Abraham was giving
up his only beloved son through faith in
God. Christ-also was an only Son, much
beloved by His Father. But when Abra-
ham received word to take Isaac off of
the altar, Rev. Smith held his listeners
spellbound in his description of the great
deliverance and salvation bestowed upon
man by God through the death of Christ.
God in receiving His Son into heaven de-
livered his people. Then Mr. Smith drew
several pictures illustrating the fact that
through the death of Christ many lives
were saved. His final picture was a large

réd esoss. Then he closed his lecture in
singing with the audience a hymn in
prayer.

High jump—Gardner (D. C.), Dumas
(D. C.), Wood (D. C.), Miles (Fresh.).
Height, 5 feet, 8 inches.

Discus—Mullis (C. H. S.), Leftwich

ner (D. C.), Suggs (D. C.), McGavock

Seven Cities Represented in Lists

—Others to Follow

Seven North Carolina high schools have
filed their entries for the annual high
chool track carnival to be staged on Rich-
ardson Field at Davidson College tomor-
row afternoon, according to Capt. Norton
G. Pritchett, who is in charge of arrange-
ments for the entertainment of the guests
and for the meet proper.

The Davidson athletic director stated
today that a number of other high school
track coaches had requested entry blanks,
and that he expected the number to in-
crease several during the next few days.
Cities who have already entered their
proteges are Greensboro, Gastonia, Ox-
ford, Winston-Salem, Cherryville, Ba-
rium Springs and Charlotte.

Capt. Pritchett has anounced that com-
petent officials for the meet have been ob-
tained, with Coach Tex Tilson acting as
referee for the afternoon’s melee, John
Currie, North Carolina sprint champion,
will be the official starter of the sprints
and runs, and track judges will be Col.
W. R. Scott, Capt. J. A. Otto and Capt.
John W. Elkins, all members of the R.
O. T. C. department here. F. D. Ho-
bart will direct the weight events and
Coach Buck Miles the heights. Many
other minor officials have been detailed
for duty. *

At the conclusion of the matinee track
carnival, a loving cup will be presented
to the captain of the school scoring ‘the
highest number of points. Dr. J. M. Mce-
Connell, of the Davidson faculty, has been
asked to make the presentation.

Nurse: “Mr. Jones, you are the fa-
ther of quadruplets.”

Mr. Jones: “What, one of those
things that runsaround on four legs?”

“Do you know what the holes in
doughnuts are used for?”

“No what?”

“To stuff macaroni.”

Good Trips Ahead for Wildkitten

Tennis Aspirants

The prospects of a winning Freshman
team are good this year. So far, the
Frosh players have been showing up
pretty well and if they continue to
play the brand of, tennis that they
played throughout ‘the fall, and they
will, they will make a pretty good
team. =

There is a chance for them to make
some pretty good trips this year. They
may make the trip to Virginia with
the Varsity as well as a trip or so
through the state.

The team will be selected in a tour-
nament to be played soon. The four
semi-finalists will be placed on the
team. They will play some good teams,
also. The Carolina team is considered
one of the best Freshman teams in the
history of the school, and Duke and
other colleges in the state are expected
to have fast teams.

Some of the leading Freshmen play-
ers are E, Z. Dubose, Fein, T) W. Me-
Clean, S. B. McClean, Rosser Elkins,
M. L. Roddey, Tompkins, Enloe, and
others, -
