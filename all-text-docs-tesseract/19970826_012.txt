New talent, attitude has team back on winning track

By DanieL Motz
Senior Staff Writer

Five. years removed from. its
magical run to the NCAA Final
Four, the men’s soccer team hopes
to make the upcoming season an-
other to remember.

, The Wildcats arrived for pre-
season focused, well-conditioned,
and ready to put Davidson back on
the college soccer map after a dis-

appointing 1996.

“The guys came in ready to
play and in great shape,” said coach
Charlie Slagle in an interview last
week. “They did more than we asked
of them and that obviously makes a
coach happy.”

Davidson won only eight of 22
games last season, but even more
disheartening was the manner in
which the talent-laden Wildcats lost,

‘as the team’s leadership — and,

ultimately, its comraderie — hope-
lessly unraveled.

But both players and coaches
promise there will be no repeat per-

formance.

“The thing I am most excited
about this season is the team atti-
tude,” said captain Phil Julien, the
squad’s topreturning scorer. “We're
doing what it takes both on and off
the field, and the team chemistry is
definitely there.”

“Tt is an entirely different pro-
gram,” said goalkeeper and fellow
captain Brad Stroble.

Jeff Weekes and Dan Guill are
also captains for this year’s team.

On the field, players are ex-
cited about the: 1-5-4-1 format
Davidson will implement, consist-

ing of one forward, five midfielders,
four defensemen, and a goalie.
“Slagle always knows how to
get the best out of his players,”
Julien explained. “If the forwards
were the power of this team, he
would be using more players on the
line, but this year the defense and
midfield are the strength.”

Julien, the team’s primary scor-’

ing threat, having accumulated 45
points in the first three years of his
career, figures to see the majority of
time in the lone forward slot. Carlos
Bowen and Wes Roache will also
see time up front.

Jeff Harrell and Drew Lindsey

Should get the starting nod at the

two outside midfield positions.
Harrell is a third-year varsity player
and Lindsey started 12 games last
year and saw action in all but one
contest.

The center-midfielders show-
case the young talent Davidson pos-
sesses. Hart Roper, who started 17
games for the Wildcats as a rookie
last year, will lead the attack in the
middle, along withnewcomers Dane
Erickson and David Buehler.

Wildcats try to reclaim Deep South.

New coach gains respect

By Jay CANTRELL

Sports Editor

The first full day of field hockey
practice did not involve sticks, balls,
or goals.

Instead, new coach Jennifer
Blizzard Halliday took the team on
asurprise trip toa high ropes course
at the Charlotte Outdoor Adventure

Center.

“T just told them we were going
onateam trip,” Halliday said of the
innovative way to build team
chimstry, confidence, and trust
among the players. “They had no
idea where they were going. I think
some of them were a little scared.”

“It’s a greatimprovement from
last year,” said goalkeeper and cap-
tain Sarah Gebhardt. “So far it’s
been a great pre-season.”

“I’m really excited,” fellow
captain Chase Keith said, echoing
Gebhardt’s enthusiast “She
(Halliday) knows the game really
well. She leads an intense practice,
but it’s also fun.”

Halliday should know the game
well after playing on four consecu-
tive North Carolina teams that fin-
ished as NCAA runners-up. She
played with and against several
members of the U.S. Olympic team
that finished fifth two summers ago
in Atlanta.

She started all four years in
high school in. her hometown of
Ocean City, N.J.,.and in 1989 was
named Atlantic City Press Player of
the Decade.

“T thought he was kidding,”

she said of the writer who'called to
notify her of this eye-popping ac-
complishment. “I started joking with
him until he finally convinced me

he was serious.”

But there’s no joking around
for Halliday when itcomes to coach-
ing this year’s field hockey team.

“My mentality is very defen-
sive,” she said of her coaching phi-
losophy. “You don’t need to teach
good players how to score, but if
you take a good player and teach
her defensive principles, she can be
outstanding.

“IT love coaching at a better
academic school. [love North Caro-
lina as a state, and I wanted to coach

Division I. Plus, it makes my job °

easier coaching smarter players.”

And.it allows her to implement
relatively advanced systems such
as the diagonal diamond defense, a
system the Wildcats will employ on
all penalty corners taken against
them this season.

' “We havea strong core of lead-
ership this year,” she added. “‘In-
stead of just two or three, we have
five or six players who have stepped
into that role.”

Halliday also stressed the im-
portance of improving throughout
the year.

“If we achieve our goals dur-
ing the season, then we’ll achieve

the end goal (of winning the Deep |

South Conference).”

“We wantto set the tone for the
next wave of Davidson field hockey
players,” said Gebhardt.

To do that, the Wildcats will
have to fare well againststrong com-
petition, starting immediately with
Saturday’s opener at Virginia.

The Wildcats look to regain |

their form of the early 1990s: They
had won six straight league titles
before posting a subpar 5-12 mark
last year.

The home opener is Sept. 6
against Louisville. Other schedule
highlights include a trip to Wake
Forest Sept. 9 and two games over
Fall Break in Washington, D.C.

The 1992 men’s soccer team. —
shocked the nation by advancing to the
Final Four held right here at Richardson
Field, electrifying the town and .
campus. _

Next week, the DSS begins a
semester-long series chronicling the
games and players that made up the

“most successful Division I athletic team
in Davidson history.
