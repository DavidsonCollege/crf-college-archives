man, the most dignified Soph on the
Hill, stepped forth in the role of a
negro preacher.

His declamation, entitled, he
Projigal Son,” was a masterpiece in
the line of humor, and his rendering
of darkie dialect eclipsed any such
previous performance. The audience
was carried on from one burst of
laughter to another, and the critic’s
unhesitating report was, “No criti-
cismi necessary.”

The debate, resolved, that Mon-
golians should have equal rights

sey

s with other immigrants, proved the
~ most

interesting feature of the
year’s program.
The affirmative was upheld by A,

C. Summers, R. F. Davidson and

- Emmet Burns McGukin, all worthy

supporters of a losing struggle, for
the decision went to the negative.

= This was composed of F. H. Patter-
. son, A. C Ormand and R. Bitzer.

Those favoring the naturalization

of Mongolians attempted to show,

that justice demands such a step,
that this only can prevent a war
with Japan, and that the yellow peo-
ple make good citizens.

In opposition to these arguments,
the negative advanced the political,
secial, and economical disadvan-
tages of admitting Mongolians into
American citizenship.

Those members who have not at-

will be reinstated without fine for
past absences, if they so desire.

PHI SOCIETY

Last Saturday night the Phi Soci-
ety had a very snappy meeting with
Dave Roberts leading the forces of
the affirmative against C. K. Brown
and the other defenders of the neg-
ative.

After the roll call by the secretary
and devotional exercises by J. F.
Clarke the battle of words began.
Dave Roberts stated the query: Re-
solved, That members of the Mon-
igolian race be admitted equally with
| other immigrants. He gave the his-
| tory of the question and defended

his point on the grounds of courtesy
and justice. C. K. Brown for the
negative favored retaining Anglo-
Saxon supremacy and to do this the
Mongolian must be shut out. He
showed that now we were not
assimilating this type of immigrant.
F. W. Smith, the second speaker for
the affirmative, based his argument
on the theory that we should love
our neighbor and this included the
Mongolian race. A.-F. Fricker,
second speaker for the negative laid
most stress on the economical side
of the, question and proved that
American Labor would not endure
these races with inferior standards

:\of living. L. B. Burney, the last

tended the meetings of this year,:

speaker for the affirmative brought!
out the fact that Southern Europ-
ean immigrants were no more de-
sirable than Chinese or Japanese
and in some cases the latter were
better and more desirable im-
migrants. H. A. Hill, the last
speaker for the negative expanded
on the two points, that the standards -
of living would be lowered, and that
these races can never be assimilated.
On the rebuttals the speakers did
little more than re-state some par-
ticular point they had brought out
before. The decision was three in

favor of the negative.

J. M. Dunlap gave an oration on
the new absence regulations.
was highly in favor of the old reg-
ulations in preference to the new
ones.

The extemporaneous debate was
upheld on the affirmative by R. R.
Deaver and on the negative by C:
N. Morrison. The subject for debate
was, Resolved: That there should
be no third party in American poli-
tics.

Decision was three in favor of the
negative.

SIGMA UPSILON BIDS
THREE NEW MEN

Dr. Shewmake Gives talk on Short
Story.

The Blue Pencil chapter of Sigma
Upsilon held its second regular
meeting last Wednesday night in
the Pi Kappa Alpha Hall, The meet-
ing opened with an interesting talk
om the short story by Dr. Shewmake.
This is a branch of writing that is
becoming more and more important
in these hurried days and was well
handled by this thorough master of
the subject.

W. P. Cumming next read a poem
which portrayed something of the
future life of a senior. Then D. L.
Mahood read the first chapter of a
continued story which the members
of the club are writing, cach chapter
having a different author.

An invitation to join the club was

extended to J. M, Gaston, Jr, C. G.'

Long and C. J. Matthews. These
imen will be initiated some time in
the near future.

starts them off for this year with
flying colors. The old members
‘hack are, J. R. Boulware, M. R.

mand, Prof. Thies and Dr. Arbuckle.

Filled with a desire to do all in

their power this year, for the stu-:

'dent body, and especially, for those

Jinterested in Chemistry, they have.
been discussing various suggestions, '

as to what can be done to make the
chemistry course and building more
attractive to the students.

The college as a whole will be
much indebted to the fraternity. this
year, as they have arranged for a
number of good lecturers to come
to speak to the student body, as
well as to the members of the fra-
ternity. The general theme of these
lectures will be chemistry. It is
hoped that all will enjoy them, and
that many students wil) take a more
lively interest in this phase of our
college course.
