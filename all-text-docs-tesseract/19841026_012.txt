20 Riding -Team Members Begin New Season

By JANICE EVANS
What began as a good turnout at the
activities fair has turned into a strong be-
ginning for Davidson's equestrian
team’s second year of competition.
The team, which only had nine riders
last year, now boasts a 20-member ros-

ter. Eleven riders went to the Oct. 14

show at the University of South
Carolina, giving Davidson a good start
on its new season.

The biggest change since last year is
diversity in ability. The Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association (the NCAA of
riding) divides all its competitions into
eight division levels, from beginning
walk-trot to open(advanced) over fences
classes. Last year Davidson only had rid-
ers in four divisions. This year a rider
competes in every division, which makes
the team competitive as a unit, not only
as individuals.

Freshmen Kim Gambal, in the inter-
mediate division, and Sian Hunter in
open provided the team with representa-
tion in classes where it was lacking last
year.

This new distribution through divi-
sions gave Davidson the points (which
are determined by how a rider finishes in
a class) to be the winning team of the
show, and to beat last year’s regional
champion, the College of Charleston,
and runner up, the University of South
Carolina. Junior Julie Waters, team co-
captain, summed up her reaction very
simply: “Quite pleasantly surprised!”

show — the total number of blue ribbons

season. The first-place finishers were

Class 8 — novice over fences; and Hunter

Cross Country Places In Meet

- By ANDY BARRON

Davidson's men’s and women’s
cross country teams ran in the UNC-
Charlotte Invitational meet last Satur-
day. Both teams turned in mediocre per-
formances as the men finished sixth out
of twelve teams and the women took fifth
of seven teams.

‘I was somewhat disappointed with
our placing,” said coach Sterling Martin.
“We were hoping to do better than we did
in both races. I thought the men’s plac-
ings and times could have,been much
better. | hope we can run in more of a
pack in the Southern Conference meet.”

Junior Frank Hague led the men’s
team. Hauge finished 21st in a time of
27:05 for the 5-mile course. Next was

sophomore Greg Foreman at 24th in
27:13. The other members to score for
Davidson were senior Lanny Smith
(32nd in 27:41), junior Taylor Simpson
(38th in 27:59), and’ freshman Bill
Breidenstein (5Ist in 28:33).

“We did fair overall,” Foreman said.
“It was good to get Lanny (Smith) and
Bill (Breidenstein) up towards the front.
If we can run more as a pack and get ev-
eryone up with that pack, we should do
well in the conference race.”

The big gap between Davidson’s first
and fifth runners was very costly in that
the Cats were nipped by Pembroke 139 to

140. Davidson did manage to beat
UNCC.

The women were able to run more as
a group then the men. Unfortunately,
that group was too far back in the overall
pack to do the team any good. “The
women’s race was especially disappoint-
ing in that we won this meet last season,”
Martin said. “The competition was much
more difficult this time around, but I still
thought we would do better than we did.”

Freshman Kappa Peddy led the
women, finishing tenth in 19:53 for the
3.1 mile course. Senior Jean Webb was
next at 21st in 20:47 and was closely fol-
lowed by junior Judy Dalton (22nd in
20:57), freshman Laura Fannin (24th in
21:11), and freshman Morrow Reeves
(28th in 21:37).

“The freshmen looked good and the
team did well considering the competi-
tion,” senior Susie Dresser said. “We
should do well at our last meet this
weekend. After that we will get ready for
nationals.” ,

The women run at Appalachian State
this weekend and will face more tough
competition. This is be their final meet

before the national championships on _~

November 17. The men _ have this
weekend off before running in the the
Southern Conference race next Saturday
at VMI.

Tomorrow at I! a.m. on the flic-

| kerball fields the Davidson All-Stars

will battle the Wofford All-Stars in a
regulation flickerball game.

‘Team managers picked these
players to represent Davidson: Dave

in Class 10, open over fences.

Seven other riders also brought home
ribbons. Senior Susan Moore and sopho-
more Kat Lehman added to their accom-
plishments of last year. Moore finished
third in Class 4, advanced walk-trot-
canter, and Lehman took fifth in Class 8,
novice over fences.

Four newcomers, in addition to
Smith and Hunter, turned in good perfor-
mances for their first intercollegiate
show. Junior Mike Braff took third in
Class |, beginning walk-trot; freshman

Heidi Hooker captured sixth in Class 5,
novice on the flat and second in Class 8;
and Gambal took third in intermediate on
the flat and fourth in intermediate over
fences.

Seniors Paige Dalton and Kelly
Sundberg and freshman Jerry Livingston
also competed, but had the misfortune of
drawing horses that were difficult to ride
and failed to finish in the top six of their
respective classes.

St. Andrew’s hosts the next show this
Saturday.
