"Milton Babbitt is such a detailed

composer and is so fascinated with
ideas of order and logic in his music,"
said professor Lawing about this
weekend's feature guest. The Milton
Babbitt Festival will be Nov. 18-20.

String Quartet to perform premier of Babbitt's "No. 6"

Many people consider Pulitzer Prize-
winning composer Milton Babbitt to be the
preeminent figure in post-World War II
American music. The public is invited to
join Babbitt and several of his friends at
Davidson College November 18-20 for a
unique musical event.

Davidson’s Milton Babbitt festival will
feature lectures by and about Babbitt, a
world premier of one of his compositions by
the Brentano String Quartet, and a perfor-
mance of his work by his close friend and
most eloquent interpreter, pianist Robert
Taub.

The New Yorker described Babbitt and
Taub as “musical blood brothers.” Though
a long generation apart in age, Babbitt has

written several pieces specifically for Taub .

during the past decade. At Davidson, Taub
will perform a piece written specifically for
him by Babbitt in 1991, “Preludes, Inter-
ludes and Postlude.”

In a concert on Friday night, Nov. 19,
the Brentano String Quartet will perform the
world premier of Babbitt’s “Quartet No. 6,”
as well as Alban Berg’s “Quartet Op. 3,”
Seymour Shifrin’s “Quartet No. 5” and
Beethoven’s “String Quartet Op. 135.” The
quartet is a newly formed ensemble com-
prised of four of the most outstanding musi-
cians of the new generation. The players are
Mark Steinberg and Serena Canin, violins;
Misha Amory, viola; and Michael Kannen,
cello.

Just prior to the world premier perfor-
mance, Claudio Spies, composer and pro-
fessor of music at Princeton University since
1970 and a colleague of Babbitt, will host a
round-table discussion of Babbitt’s piano
music and the string quartet.

Beyond the extraordinary power of his
music, Babbitt admits to being, “somewhat
ofa talker.” He will have ample opportunity
to exercise that virtue at Davidson, speaking
about his music on at least two occasions.

His keynote lecture on Thursday night will
be “A Composer of a Certain Age.” He will
also give an informal lecture-recital with
Robert Taub, during which he will speak
specifically about Taub’s program.

Babbitt has been regarded for almost 40
years as a demanding composer who flirts
with the outer limits of most musicians’
techniques. His first compositions were the
set of “Three Compositions.”

Babbitt said about his work, "Some
people say my music is 'too cerebral.' Actu-
ally, I believe in cerebral music in applica-
tion of intellect to relevant matters."

The music department, the Union's Art-
ist Series, and Friends of the Arts at Davidson
will sponsor the weekend's events. The
main coordinator from the music depart-
ment is Dr. Mauro Botelho.

Music professor, William Lawing said,
"This is really a significant event; Babbitt
has had a profound influence on music,
directly and indirectly."

Early eighties nostalgia

Face it — listening to pop
music from the early Eighties is
little more than a shameless nos-.
talgia trip. Sometimes it seems the
radio dial between 1980 and 1986
was just a big bright supermarket
filled with aisle after aisle of one-

hit wonders, cheesy synthesizers,
and stinky lyrics. But who cares?
It was great. People my age were
lucky to have lived through that
period at a time of their lives when
they were old enough to hear it and
young enough not to get uptight
about how goofy it all was. We
didn’t know anything, so why not
be-bop along to “Girls Just Wanna
Have Fun?” Even the few songs I
knew that did have adult themes
went over my head; when a holier-
than-thou older cousin asked me
what “Little Red Corvette” was
about, I screamed, “Stupid! It’s
abouta little red Corvette!” If Thad
gotten the impression that anything
by the Thompson Twins meant
anything worthwhile, I would have
changed stations.

Give up a few minutes right
now and take another shameless
trip back and find out how much
useless trivia about Eighties music
you know. Good luck and stay rad.

1. The video to her hit “Money
Changes Everything” features her
soaring in a trash can over a cap-
tive audience. Who is she?

2. What was the telephone
number title of the hit by the quint-
essential one-hit wonder, Tommy
Tutone?

3. What former member of
sixties group the Fifth Dimension
hosted the show “Solid Gold” dur-
ing its early eighties heyday?

4. Mr. Mister had the number
five and number nine songs of
Casey Kasem’s 1986 year-end sur-
vey. What were they?

5. As their debut single “Who

Can It Be Now?” was tearing up
the American charts, Australian
group Men At Work was still ful-
filling a contract to open for an-
other Australian band in a small
bar. That other group became fa-
mous too, a few years after Men At
Work. Who were they?

6. What Dutch group could
barely speak enough English to
crank out the words to their hit
“Safety Dance?”

7. What Tears For Fears song
is played in the closing scene of the
teen flick “Real Genius?”

8. Athen-unknown American
band spent a few days in 1983
promoting their first album, Mur-
mur, by opening for the Police in
huge venues like Shea Stadium.
Even though these stadiums held
fifty times the crowd of this band’s
usual audience of the time, their
guitarist declared it “A waste of
f time.” Who were they?

9. What was Duran Duran’s
first chart hit, in 1981?

10. What are the seven chart
hits from the world’s best-selling
album, Thriller?

11. Danny Elfman now makes
a career out of writing instrumen-
tal scores to movies like “Batman”
and Beetlejuice.” But 10 years ago
he was the leader of a typical early
Eighties band that made the theme
to the movie Weird Science and
appeared in the Rodney
Dangerfield flick Back to School.
What was the band’s name?

12. Those annoying shirts that
said “Frankie Say Relax”...who or
what was “FRANKIE?”

13. What Toto song was
awarded song of the year, and in
what year, of the early Eighties?”

14. What song by the group
Soft Cell has the distinction of
spending more weeks in the top 40
than any other song?

15. Which of the following
songs — “Eye of the Tiger,”
“Mickey,” "We Got The Beat,”
“Like a Virgin” — did “Weird Al”
Yankovic not parody?

sang mostly from his old albums, pleasing the audience which greeted familiar songs with
applause. The intimate atmosphere of the 900 Room allowed for a casual environment which
Wilcox seemed to enjoy--he played three encores. The Union Intimate Performances Committee

Still. Whistlin' Dixie
Kershaw's Haunted Heart falls short

I don’t know what to tell you
about Sammy Kershaw’s new one,
Haunted Heart. Five really great
songs grace this album. At the
same time, however, there are five
excruciatingly unbearable tunes
that even I can’t stand.

The title track leads that pa-
thetic quintet of vile verse. This
weak attempt at a metaphorical
conceit, coupled with what seems
like a John Anderson imperson-
ation, is annoying at best. During
the Halloween season, because the
DJs thought it was cute, we got
enough of this one to choke a horse
and the rider.

The other four didn’t make
the air waves for good reason. For
the most part, they’re all bluesy

songs, miserably led by a Louisi-
anian on the piano. The band .

doesn’t sound good at all. They
lack some sort of coherence and
togetherness.

Thankfully, the other five lie
at the opposite end of the spec-
trum. “Cry, Cry Darlin’” and “A
Memory That Just Won’t Quit”
practically drag you to the dance
floor. Most of you already heard

"This weak attempt
at a metaphorical
conceit...is annoying
at best."

“She Don’t Know She’s Beauti-
ful.” It strikes me as the Country
version of Clapton’s “Wonderful
Tonight.” “Still Lovin’ You,” for
me, was the biggest surprise on the
album. Sammy whipped out a
classical guitar and a fantastic voice
for this one. Though it doesn’t
show on mostofhis songs, this guy
can sing like an angel.

Despite all the greatness of
those four, however, “Queen of

My Double Wide” stands above
them all. How can you not love a
song with that title? Well, actu-
ally, I’ve heard a lot of people say
they can’t stand it. It’s too foolish
or silly. I disagree. Though it is
foolish, and it is silly, it contains
the perfect amount of foolishness
and silliness to pass for tasteful.
I'd go as far as to say it portrays a
fascinating working class relation-
ship with clever elegance.

But, as for this album, I don’t
know what to tell you. Despite
those five exceptional ones, I
wouldn’t buy Haunted Heart.
Whenever! get the urge to listen to
“Queen of My Double Wide” Ill
just borrow the tape from a friend
of mine (I'll give you his name and
number if you get that same urge).
It’s not really a bad album, it just
falls short. Two more “Double
Wides” and I would have given ita
thumbs up.
