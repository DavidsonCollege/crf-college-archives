Judge Recounts Work Of Court
For Year, Surveys: Future Of Body

By E. H. BARRY

The purpose of the Court of
Control this year has been two
fold. In the first place, among the
upperclasses there are some who
seem to have a desire to subject
the freshmen to all manners of in-
dignity. The court must satisfy this
desire to some extent. This how-
ever, is not the chief function, In
the second place and most im.
portant, it is the duty of the court
to help the new students integrate
themselves into the student body.
In this capacity the court should
instill in the freshmen our many
traditions and that intangible some-
thing which we call the “David-
son Spirit.”

The Freshmen Regulations show
evidences of both of these purposes,
but the second is given far more
emphasis. Each year there are sev-
eral new men who find it impossi-
ble to abide by these regulations.
In such case the court must take
action to prevent repeated viola-
tions by the same men. This year
we have again used the counseling
system. Here the offender is made
a “stud boy” for some upperclass-
man, often a member of the court.
He ‘is required to dé various
menial tasks for the upperclass.
men, such as washing cars, going
to the stud, etc. Usually these up-
perclassmen have been previously
contacted and have shown‘a_ wil-
lingness to help. Through this as-
sociation it is hoped that the up-
perclassman will be able to help
the freshman become more adapted
to Davidson and our way of life.

For punishments this year the
court has tried-to use the offenders
constructively, They have helped
the football managers, helped on
the Davidsonian, assisted the an-
nual staff, and have been made
available for other purposes. There

have been other punishments, as
a necessity, but where ever possi-
ble we have attempted to make
them constructive.

For the Court to be effective it
must have the support and coopera.
sion of the entire student body.
Cooperation has been good this
year, but there is room for im-
provement. First, the chapel pro-
grams should have the solémnity
that would be conducive to thé
respect which the court needs from
the freshmen. Secondly, we need
more action and tess complaints on

championship in the interfrater-

deception and fine passing. He was
third in the polling for the second
straight year. Many of his break-
away runs or his good passes meant
the difference in several games this
year. He handled most of the plays
for the Sigs during their one-defeat

season.
Jim Smith, Pika

Another backfield — performer
elected to the honorary’ team was
the playmaker of the third-place
Pikas, Jim Smith. Jim, a senior,
helped lead his team to the most
successful season in several years.
Jim handled the Pika attack and
showed some fine passing arid shif-
ty running.

Max DeVane, Phi Delts

Max DeVane proved to be one
of the finest defensive players tha:
the league saw this year. Max's
speed and shiftiness made him a
real headache for the opposing
backfield men. Max also added a
steady brand of offensive play which
helped his Phi Delt team roll to
second place.

T. W. Aldred, KA

T. W. Aldred ‘stood out as one
of the finest passers in the circuit
this season. His speed and excel-
lent ball handling made him a con-
stant threat. T. W. was a member

of last year’s interfraternity All-

was a good ball handler and was

reprimand the offenders as well as
charge them before the court, we
believe that the freshmen would be
more impressed with the fact that
we mean business. Many upper-
classmen have also been lax in
making charges and have allowed
violations to go uncharged or
reprimanded. The greatest weak-
ness of the court this year has been
that it is completely dependent on
the cooperation and support of the
upperclasses. This should not be
the weakness, but rather the
strength of a strong court.

We hope that these suggestive
improvements will be considered
next year by the new court as well
as by all upperclassmen.

Not without reasons did the

some glory in his final year), for
he was First. in the Big Five scor-

Southern circuit and he tied for
third in scoring with Sturgess of

Le Cercle Francais, the honor-

Among the highlights of the
meeting were a piano solo, Polo.

short skit “Un Pew Exagere.” Tak-
ing part in the skit were Dave

Afterwards the members of Le

Richard Holshouser and
Charlie Curry are fresh-
men in charge of organizing a
band which will furnish music
during the game and entertain-
ment in the form of a variety
show afterwards.

Leading the frosh in cheering and
yelling will be Jerry Walker and
his band of merrymakers. They
will organize the freshmen cheers
and strive to keep their spirits
high.

Charlie Cousar, president of
the sophomore class, is the co-
ordinator of the sophomore
teams and will lead his forces
against the freshmen on the
big day.

Larry Dagenhart is quoted as
saying, “The freshmen are show-
ing a lot of spirit; the sophomores
will have to get on the ball if
they want to win.”

aged close to 40 yards in two years.
Jim is known to be a fine pass-
receiver and even did some pass-
ing in the Citadel game, complet-
ing 4 out of 5.

All this adds up to the fact
that Jim Thacker is an outstand-
ing football player and that a. lot
of responsibility now rests with him
to help Coach Dole and the men
who clear the path build a stronger
Davidson team next year.

releases signed by their parents,
and who still wish to give blood,
take them home with them over

the weekend if at all possible. Per-

sons 21 or over need no permis-
sion in order to donate.

Lamon said that in view of the
splendid record that the Davidson
student body has in making gen-
erous blood donations to the Red
Cross, he is certain that this drive
will be another success. Lamon
emphasized that the Scabbard and
Blade is seeking no glory or pub-
licity in sponsoring the drive, but
only hopes that it is filling -a neces-
sary function in handling the many
important details that such an un-
dertaking entails. “The success or
fadure of the drive is up to the
students and townspeople,” Lamon
added.

younger than these. Their
number is increasing because
the country is strewn with
discarded hand grenades and
forgotten land mines; children
pick up these “novelties’”’ or
stumble on them while scour-
ing for a bit of grass or dried
wood as fuel.

The idea for such a rehabilita-
tion project was promoted by Dr.
Torrey, a veteran Presbyterian
U.S.A. missionary. Dr. Torrey
hismelf lost a hand in China dur-
ing World War Il and thus knows
full well the opportunities and re-
adjustments that must be afforded
these victims of tragedy if they are
to return to anything like a normal
life.

Dr. Torrey arrived in Korea in

‘| July, 1952, to set up the project,

assisted by a team of missionary
doctors, nurses, and technicians,
especially trained. As rapidly as
Koreans can be trained to form
other teams, the work will be ex-
panded, as gifts make it possible.

A center for making and fitting
limbs has been set up at Chongju
and another center for providing
peg-legs and other simple appli-
ances will be opened in Taejon.
These teams will

out of aluminum gasoline tanks
discarded by the air force in’ Ko-
rea. They plan to train Korean op-
erators for the knitting machines
to make socks for the atnputees in
the textile mill at Taejon. Head-
quarters will be in Seoul, Korea.

‘In order to accomplish the
purpose of giving assistance
to. the thousands of Korean
amputees, it is planned to do
the following: 1) Provide am-
putees with artificial limbs.

2) Perform such orthopedic

operations as are necessary. 3)

Train amputees in the use of

new limbs, 4) Give vocational

training, including the making
of artificial limbs, and in agri-
culture. '

Suitable limbs and appliances
will be provided with necessary
surgical and hospital care. Then
will follow training in the use
of these, together with practical
vocational training. On the mission
farm and in shops, that will be
set up, the patients will be pre-
pared for normal living and to be
independent despite their handi.

Throfigh counseling, special serv-
ices, and Bible study prograths the
psychological and spiritual prob-
lems will be met. By such activ-
ities not only reorientation to life
will be accomplished, but it is
hoped, many will be prepared to re-

Church World Service is the
official sponsor of the Korea
Amputee Project. The Presby-

of CWS, is cooperating in this
project, funds being sent
through the department of
Overseas Relief and Inter-
Church Aid of the Board of
World Missions, Paul B. Free-
land, Secretary.

The CWS project is already un-
derway and. functioning. A “shop”
has been set up under the direc-
tion of Paul Kingsbury, a young
Presbyterian, U.S.A. missionary, in
premises provided by Severance
Hospital and Medical College in
Seoul. The shop is the place where

prosthetic appliances are made, as-

But by and large the greatest
factor in the rehabilitation of an
amputee is the psychological one.
Following corrective surgery (nec--
essary in most cases) and fitting
of prosthetic appliances, a  pro-
gram of physical and occupational
therapy is necessary to mold his
spirit. He must still be trained to
earn a livelihood.

The student body has set as a
minimum goal for this amputee re-
habilitation project $4,500.00.

This is to be a part of the
CWS's budgeted item of $50,000
for 1953, but will stand as an in-
dividual gift, since it will com-
pletely fill the item in the budget
of the Presbyterian Church, U. S.

There is, definitely, a need.
