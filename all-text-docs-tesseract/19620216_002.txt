Colleges And A Question{Of Freedom

Several weeks ago Clemson Col-
lege cancelled its invitation to the
Rev. Dr. Albert T. Mollegen, Episcopal
theologian who was to speak at the
college's religious emphasis services,
when two South Carolina politicians
produced records of the House Un-
American Activities Committee accus-
ing him of affiliation with Communist
front organizations in the 1930's.

Clemson President Robert C. Ed-
wards, in buckling to “outside” pres-
sures and withdrawing the invitation
said it might be “embarrassing” for
Mollegen to appear. The Episcopal
bishop has emphatically denied the
“Communist” label placed on him.

This week. the Rev. David An-
drews was dismissed from his position
as Wesley Foundation Director at
Appalachian State Teachers College
at Boone, N. C. His removal by the
Board of Directors of the Foundation
was based on pressures arising from
his passive demonstrations before the
White House for the cause of Martin
Sobel during Christmas season. An-
drews was subsequently called a Com-
munist by manv radical protesters. He
strongly denied the charges.

Last spring, another South Caro-
lina college, Winthrop, was strongly
censored by the state legislature for
inviting Dr. Frank Porter Graham to
the campus. He had mentioned some-
thing about the sit-in movement dur-
ing his speech. The conservative poli-
ticians decree no_ state-supported
school was to invite that “radical
leftist’ again.

COLLEGE MUST STAND FIRM

All these instances are enough to
indicate the serious challenge which
exists todav to academic freedoms and
individual rights. In a time of radical-
ism and witch-hunting, the college
community especially must stand
strong in providing open-minded dis-
cussion and in encouraging members
-of its family to speak out clearly their
own convictions and views.

Clemson, Appalachian and Winth-
rop are examples of institutions which
have succumbed to the pressures of
businessmen and politicians who have
closed their minds to the basic Ameri-
can principles. We are disturbed about
the mounting “outside” pressures, but
even more so at the growing number

An Old Twist

The time has come when it is
necessary that definite steps should
be taken by right thinking students
regarding the modern dance question.
No longer is the ballroom a place for
innocent recreation, but it has deter-
iorated into a rendezvous where “po-
lite society dissipation” is at its prem-
jum. Jt has almost reached the point
of becoming one of our absorbing
social problems.

Not only is drinking running riot,
but what is worse, many girls, fre-
quently half dressed, are engaging
with partners still under the influence
of liquor in those modern dances con-
ducive to impure thoughts and sensa-
tions. We tremble to think of the in-
evitable results.

It is our belief, to speak it plainly,
that a decent girl cannot afford to
attend dances where such practices
are permitted. Parents, especially the
mothers, do not seem to sense the
peril concealed in this amusement in
its present state of degradation.

Should not the college men of
America then rise to meet the issue?
Has our ideal of womanhood and man-
hood reached the point where we no
longer consider modesty as essential?

of college administrations which are
giving way to them.

Anytime a college allows busi-
nessmen, politicians or financial con-
tributors to pull the strings or control
its programs or speakers or put clamps
on the rights of its faculty to speak
out, that college has relinquished the
vital spark of a thriving liberal arts
educational community.

DAVIDSON NOT EXEMPT

Unfortunately, Davidson is not
exempt from such pressures either.
Our physical isolation does not isolate
us from the uninformed criticism, and
pressures of southern constituents,
and more unfortunately, even from
some members of the college family
itself.

It is not unusual for the adminis-
tration to receive questions and pro-
tests about “that Communist on your
faculty.” Many would like for David-
son professors to withdraw into an
ivory tower and completely dissociate
themselves from the public scene,

There are some both within and
outside the college who would protest
the stocking of the Union book store
with “Communist” books or ‘dirty’
novels like Tropie of Cancer.

Undoubtedly, this busybody pub-
lic finds nothing to protest (and per-
haps much to comfort) in the college’s
being host to right-wingers Fulton
Lewis II, L. Mendel Rivers, and Wal-
ter Judd. One can imagine the uproar
and accusations which would come if
instead of the ultra-conservative line,
or even in addition to it, we invited
Jimmy Roosevelt. or Justice Hugo
Black, or Sen. Hubert Humphrey to
the campus.

BEST OF OUR KIND?

There is a strong need for leading
southern colleges to speak out in de-
fense of academic freedom. to take
upon their shoulders the roles that
the general public refuses to assume
in keeping an open, two-sided forum
of issues and .in attacking this insane
ultra-rightist movement which is in-
festing the country.

Davidson calls herself the leading
liberal arts college in the South and
the “best of our kind in the nation.”
That is presently being challenged.
Need anymore be said?

Surely this cannot be. Our duty,
therefore, is plain.

It should be our high purpose
not to countenance or gaze with in-
difference upon the evils of modern
dancing. but to do all in our power to
elevate this amusement to a refined
plane. In this way can we render a
great service in maintaining the
American standard of clean manhood
and pure womanhood.

Davidson’ College happily does
not have to contend with this form of
recreation on her campus, but we do
know that some of her students are
like other people in that they attend
dances when at home or elsewhere.
It is to these that we make the plea
that they enlist in the fight to raise
dancing to its former standard of
decency.

This should be the common cause
of the college men of America, for in
their hands is an influence and a
power that can accomplish this great
service for our present-day society.
As true Southern gentlemen the stud-
ents of Davidson can only enlist on
the side of decency and modesty.

Rep. Judd Embraces
Individual Conservatism

BY DR. JAMES G. MARTIN
Chemistry Department

The approaching visit of the
Republican Representative from
the 5th district of Minnesota,
Walter H. Judd, is yet another
triumph among the efforts of
various people to ensure that
there will be no lack of oppor-
tunity for the cultivation of
political awareness at Davidson.
The anticipated convocation uf
February 26 brings to our cam-
pus a most articulate and in-
fluential spokesman for the con-
servative faction in Congress.

Judd serves on the House For-
eign Relations Committee, was
U. S. delegate to the United Na-
tions General Assembly {n 1957,
was congressional delegate to
the 1958 Geneva Conference on
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy,
arid is remembered for his stir-
ring (at least to 49.9% of the
citizenry) keynote -address at
the 1960 Republican National
Convention.

Added interest derives from
a 1960 report that he was
privately urged upon R chard

Nixon as a cho'ce for Se-re-

tary of State, had the of*e’a!

poll resulted in a Republican
victory.

Congressman Judd his Leen

‘a prophetic and capable leader

in his role as an effective anti-
Communist (that he is outsp9k:
enly -anti-Robert Welch’ is of
additional! significance!). On re-
turning from his. hospital .in
China to the United States in
1938, he tried with limited suz-

cess to arouse Americans to the
dangers of Japanese military ex-
pansion and to Communist sub-
version in China. Events have
since proven his judgment. He
continues to oppose diplomatic
“recognition” of the “Commu-
nist regime in China” (my ital-
ics), ‘as well as its admission to
the U.N., and is thus featured
along with Senators Dodd and
Douglas in a recent documen-
tary film entitled “Red China
—Outlaw.”

Judd has advocated negotiat-
ing with the Communists on
the diplomatic level, but rejects
«with the present administra-
tion) the unprofitable approach
of summitry, feeling that ‘open
covenants ... can not be openly
arrived at.” .

An analysis of Judd’s voting
record on roll-call votes by
the 1961 Congressional Quar-
terly Almanac reveals an in-
dividualistic viewpoint in his
conservatism. While he has
supported President Ken-
nedy'’s foreign policy position
on &7% of the votes, he has
voted against the executive
position on $4°% of all domes-
tic policy bills.

Perhaps the oest indication of
his political philusophy was his
opposition to all ten bills favor-
ing a larger role for the federal
government. On the other hand,
he voted with the so-called “Con-
servative Coalition” only 70%.
whica-ia contrasted with' at least
32 Revresentatives who voted
* coalition” 96° or more of the

time. He actively supported
medical care for the aged as ad-
ministered through the states.

He voted for the Civil Rights
Act of 1960; opposed the use of
federal funds for school con-

struction in 1961; supported the
stronger Landrum-Griffin ver-
sion of the labor reform bill in
1959; and voted for continuing
the appropriation for the De-
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare (along with nearly
everybody else), (and, lest I be
pointedly misunderstood, the
last vote was included at least
half facetiously).

This then is not a record
that can be simply written off
as Neanderthal or Mossback,
nor can it be blithely counter-
ed by incantations about a
Fascist Right Wing. Judd is
viewed herein as an enlight-
ened conservative.

He takes Communism at its
word with regard to its objective
being the victory of World Com-
munism, and domestically he
maintains the constitutional pro-
visions for States’ Rights (al-
though not at the expense of the
Negro).

While it is probable that. not

-everyone will anticipate Con-

gressman Judd's address as
eagerly as others, it is neverthe-
less certain that none will dis-
pute the monor and propriety of
having as our guest: a most dis-
tinguished member of a most
constitutional institution, .the
United States House of Repre-
sentatives.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Willer Raps ‘Slanted Article;’
Brenner Deerys ‘Holy Days’

Willer

Dear Editor:

Many times in the past. THE
DAVIDSONIAN has, in my opin-
ion, lost its sense of propriety,
but never quite as it did this
past Friday. You devoted five
columns to a headline. which
grossly misrepresented the facts.

In the heading for the article
on the “Integration” poll recent-
ly taken you used an unqualified
“majority” and “students.” The
heading—which ran: “Majority
says yes to Trustees” and “Stud-
ents vote in favor of integra-
tion""—gave the connotation that
a majority of the Davidson stud-
ents voted in favor of integra-
tion.

MINORITY VOTED

Nothing could be further from
the truth. A little quick math
reveals that a mere 30 per cent
of the students actually voted
for integration.

It seems that the entire arti-
cle was elanted in the direction
of your recent editorials on in-
tegration. May I point out,
among other things, your seem-
ing refusal to state that only 30
per cent of the students voted
in favor of integration.

Lee Kirby wrote in his editor.
ial (“A Joint Behest”) that he
felt the poll to be “‘an accurate
reflection of student sentiment.”
He can no more assume this
than I can that the over 400
students who did not vote are

against integration.
CRUSADERS VOTED

If an assumption is to be
made, however, I feel that mine
is the safer of the two. In my
opinion most. of the students
who favor integration were at
the polls voting, for they always
seem to take on. a crusading at-
titude. .

As an editor it is your prero-
gative to print what you wish in
the editorials, but in the future
you should not forget your re-
sponsibility to the students who
elected you by letting your sen-
timents slant the presentation
of the news.

Dear Editor:

Thursday comes, and “Holy
Day” is with us again. We stand
sullenly and silently for a hymn,
listen to a prayer, then relax in
our chapel seats for five minutes
while some professor gives a
poorly prepared, superficial talk
on the application of “our”

PEANE TS

Christian ethics.
ASSUME FAITH

I wonder if some of these
gentlemen really know what is
going through our heads, or care
to trouble themselves enough to
find out. They assume that all
of us have polished Christian
faiths and only need occasional
moralistic reminders.

Apparently, they have not
heard of the many doubters, or
of those who just don’t care
about the whole religious busi-
ness.

NEW APPROACH NEEDED

Chapel might be made a great
institution. The student body
might approach it with a posi-
tive attitude. But the main need
is for speakers who have some-
thing worth saying and who can
say it! If future scheduled pro-
fessors can do no better than
those in the past, let them de-
cline the invitation to speak or
give the students free cuts.

Almost anything would be an
improvement over the present
third rate cultic rites.

Five Dances, Variety
Were Weekend Case

DR. W. G. WORKMAN
Psychology Department

Thirty-five yeors ago it wes
different; maybe not better, but
different.

There would be five official
dances. Friday afternoon there
was a tea-dance, referred to in
the social columns as a the dan-
sent, that night a formal dance,
Saturday morning a breakfast
dance, always called a “Ger-
man,” then another the dansant,
and finally a Saturday night for-
mal dance. Between dances
there were dates for meals and
after the formal dances late
dates.

STAG LINE

When you had finally gotten
an acceptance for the weekend,
you began filling out your date’s
card and your own. You reserv-
ed the first tea-dance and the
last formal for yourself, and
usually one or both of the late
dates, and always two or three
of the meals. The rest of the
dates you swapped with your
fraternity brothers or other
friends. If you had trouble fill-
ing your date’s card with your
equals, there was always a pool
of freshmen to draw from.

At the dances, where a prime
requisite was a long stag line,
at least as many stags as
“drags,” breaking was most im-
portant. In addition to the card
for the weekend, there was a
ecard for each dance. You re
served the first and last no-
breaks for yourself, and you
swapped the other no-breaks
with friends.

If you were pinned, you might
reserve one or two more of the
usual six or seven no-breaks.
Sometimes, of course, what
wasn’t intended as a no-break
turned out to be one. At such
times frantic glances and waved

folding money might avail. If.

these didn’t, pity the poor fresh-
LOVE TRIUMPHS
man after the ball was over.
You might feel a bit down-
cast at having to share your girl
so generously, but then you
were yourself being spiced by
varicty, and when it came to
enduring blind dates (this was,
of course, then as now, a two-
way endurance contest) you had
it made. You two were not stuck
with each other.

Your worst trouble came

when you had filled your blind.
date’s card with careful variety
and then you fell in love with
her at the the dansant. You had
given yourself only the barest
minimum of meals and dances,
maybe no late dates, and now
you had to have more. This
could ‘prove expensive. One
group of “robber barons” had
kept their cards blank for just
such opportunities. For five dol-
lars and a U-Drive-It (practically
nobody had a car of his own or
could get the family car) you
could get one of the stags to
take the date you wanted to get
free from; for another five dol-
lars you could buy the time of
your new love from the brother
you had inveigled into signing
for her. Then, of course, for a
reasonably unreasonable fee you
could purchase transportation
for the new situation.

This sort of thing was well
worth it all, unless, as I have
heard happened, your new and
expensive girl handed you her
pocket-book as you parted at the -
station, and when you opened it
to. get her tickets out you found
the lining studded with frater-
nity pins, filed in order and with
a place reserved for yours, now
new-shining on her breast.

ADVANTAGES GALORE

All of. this meant, naturally,
that you didn’t have to have a
date to have an enjoyable or
profitable (or both) weekend.
You could have some mighty at-
tractive partners for short per-
iods, and even make money at
it. There was another advantage; .
you could take out insurance
against the lonely weekend. You
could ask more than one girl,
and if two came, judicious
scheduling could leave each one
convinced that she was the only
one on your bid.

If five came, you could have
an appendectomy carefully tim-
ed to have you in condition, by -
the time of their arrival, to en-
joy company or convincingly
feign excruciating illness and.
persuade three of the five that
each was your only girl, and
wasn’t she lucky that you got
her such a good substitute while
you were suffering. postoperative
pains. The two that you couldn't
persuade could find “No Visit-
ors” hung on your door.

Ivey Alerts Fair Visitors
To Rampant Culture Here

BY BOB IVEY

Dear Mrs. van Scott:

You have called to my atten-
tion the fact that your daughter
has been invited to attend Dav-
idson's annual Midwinters week-
end. I will be happy to provide
you with the information you
have requested.

First of all, yes, Davidson is
the college of gentlemanly
students. It is, as you say, The
Cultural College of the South,
and the Midwinters weekend
is one of our cultural high-
lights of the year.

The weekend will include con-
certs by the Netherlands Cham-
ber Choir and by a new male
vocal ensemble which chooses
its name from the immortal
words of Alfred Noyes and the
subject of its most recent com-
pos'tion from the very fabric
from which our lovely land was
created.

The Friday evening perform-
ance will be followed by a lovely
dance in our spacious Wildcat
Ball-room. Entertainment for
this phase of the night’s activi-
ties will feature such contem-
porary musicians as Dr. B.
Brown, Count Otis van Redding-
ham, Lord J. Jenkins, and the
Duke of Earl.

Dr. H. P. Smith, noted authori-
ty on new developments in res-

piratory diseases who first iso- P.S

lated Type-R Pneumonia and
B.W. Flu, was not permitted to
be here as planned, because of
the financial position of an
agent friend.

Seturday’s concert will be
followed by an evening of re
faxation end learning. The
students and dates will be pro-
portioned into thirteen groups
which will conduct private
instruction on contemporary
music, dancing, and items of
similer interest. There will

also be private discussion on
the natural rights of man.

Midwinters weekend will also
see the issuing of the long
awaited copies of our fine arts
magazine. I understand that in
this issue the literary portion
is devoted to a discussich of
Biblical passages ‘and the art
portion to water color paintings.
It will be called “Scriptures and
Prangs.”’

Your daughter wil! be housed
in the beautiful Belk home. If
your daughter stays out past the
.prescribed Davidson curfew.
Mrs. Belk will put our campus
police farce to work, immed-
iately. Let me assure you, how-
ever, it is very seldom that Mrs. °
Belk performs such a duty.

I know the boy your daugh-
ter is dating very well. Dave
Idson is a fine young man..
Yes, the Gamma Delts are
very good here. In fact, they
have the largest house on
campus.

I am certain that Agnes will
have an enjoyable weekend and
that she will return definitely
more educated in many ways. !
assure you that she will be in
good hands while here, and Dav-
idson looks forward to having
her.

Yours in culture,

Mrs. Less

Supv. of Midwinters guests

Yes, as a matter of fact, Dean
Rusk is an alumnus of this
school. He attended Davidson
and Oxford on our 4-1 plan.

Please disregard paragraphs
35 of this letter. Mr. Waugh

me that because of innumerable
fluctuations in scheduling, the

vide the entertainment for the
weekend.
