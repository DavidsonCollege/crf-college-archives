Students thank Little
with party, giant card

By AMANDA HALL

Imagine receiving a birthday card
so large (9’ x 5.5’) that it will appear in
’ the new edition of The Guiness Book of
World Records! At 1:30 p.m. next
Monday, Mr. E.H. Little will receive
this token of students’ appreciation in
honor of his 97th birthday.

Liz Burke and Kathy Boylston
designed this gargantuine card, and
you are one of over 1300 students who
may sign it. The card will be available
all Spring Frolics weekend for signa-
tures. It will be at the Post Office all
day Friday.

Since only 150 people may attend the
birthday banquet next Monday night,
‘a campus-wide party will be given at
1:30 p.m. that day. This memorable
celebration will be on Richardson

Plaza.
Mr. Little will ride around Richard-

son Plaza in a horse-drawn carriage at
the 1:30 ceremony. Arriving at a
platform in front of the library en-
— trance, he will be introduced by SGA

President bruce Brown.

Thereafter, Mr. Little will tour the
library he built. A receiving line will be
set up at the circulation desk after the
tour, so all students will have an
opportunity to meet Mr. Little in
person. Says Barnard, “It’s a small
way we can all say thank-you for what
he has done for the school.’’

For the students fortunate to be
selected last week in the lottery, the
official birthday banquet Monday eve-
ning should be quite an experience.
This dinner will be at 6:30 p.m. in the
Chambers Gallery and will be video-
taped for those who cannot attend.

Floor shows are scheduled to follow
this sumptuous feast, where a huge
cake baked to scale of the E.H. Little
Library will be served. Performances
include renowned Silk Spun and David-
son’s Barbershop Quartet.

In addition, student groups are
slated to provide amusing skits for the
audience, which will be composed not
only of Davidson students, but friends
of Mr. Little and specially invited
guests ofPresident Spencer.

The Davidsonian cannot overempha-
size the role of students in the ‘Big

Frolics crowd weekend

Features Editor

Today ushers in the third and last big
weekend of the year. The activities slated
are numerous, ranging from the expected
bands and dances to carnival rides and
croquet tournaments.

Thursday the fun starts early, with the
two rides which are located beside the
Union. These will remain through Satur-
day.

Tonight students may get their first
sample of the musician David Amram in
the 900 Room at 9:30 and 11:00 pm.
Amram will be on campus all weekend,

appearing at places and times yet to be
decided.

Friday the outdoor concert, to be held
at 2pm beside the baseball field will

feature soft drinks and kegs. While you.

enjoy your drinks you can listen to the
music of the three acts which will be
playing background music.

John Stanfield, guitarist, opens the
concert with easy, mellow music. You
might want to catch the very beginning of
his performance so as to get an early start
on the drinks.

highlight of this year. The students

Old scores
acquire new

unusual flavor

By MARY DAWN ROARK
Staff Writer

To the conservative mind, many of
the very unusual adaptations and
transpositions of classical music seem
as unlikely as a Parthenon in the
middle of Nashville, Tennessee. Yet
both are well received.

One striking example is the rendition
of Vivaldi’s ‘“‘The Four Seasons” by
The New Koto Ensemble of Tokyo.
This eighteenth century Venetian com-
poser’s piece was published in Amster-
dam in 1725. In the early 1970's, the
piece was transcribed by Keigo Taun-
oda for a sextet of virtuoso koto
players.

“The Four Seasons’ was originally
intended to be performed by strings,
harpsichord continuo, and a solo violin.
The koto, upon first impression, does
seem an odd replacement. Similar to
the Western zither, it is six feet in
length with thirteen silk strings
stretched over individual bridges. The
strings are plucked by plectra which
are attached to the thumb, index and
middle fingers of the right hand.

The Japanese choice of the Vivaldi
work is, in fact, quite logical. As
indicated by the name, there is a
concerto for each season. In traditional
Japanese music, the theme deals with
one or more of the seasons, with a
special emphasis on spring and au-
tumn.

The chief problem was in transcri-
bing a piece originally composed for
bowed instruments into a workable
