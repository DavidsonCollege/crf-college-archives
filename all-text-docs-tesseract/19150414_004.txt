originality in manner of presentation the

“That Night Honey Got Lost.” Mr.
R. D. Hall, of the Belmont High

well for their splendid efforts, and hopes
that they will decide to stage their next
meet here again. .

Basket Ball Game.

An interesting feature of the contests
was the game of basket ball on the local
high school, diamond between girls of
the Belmont High School and a like
team from the Matthews High School.
A number of college students were on
hand to cheer for the rival teams. At
the end of the first half the score stood
2 to1 in Belmont’s favor; but during
the last half Belmont by superior team
work forged steadily ahead and the final
score stood 9 to 1 in their favor.

DAVIDSON IS TRICMPHANT

f
would increase our possible South Amer-
ican commerce.

» Phe last speaker, Lewis King, — of
Madison, Ga., made a wonderful de-
bate, attempting to show that American
sentiment is against such an alliance;
that it would not make for peace; and
that the non-civilized South American
countries are not capable of such an al-
liance. He was a master of ridicule,
though through the skill of our debaters,
it proved his downfall,

Kach man was given six minutes for
rebuttal; and it was here that Davidson
clearly showed her superiority. — Manory
confined this time to the upholding of
two substitute plans and to the descrip-
tion of dark conditions of civilization in
Latin America. Davidson demonstFated
the weaknesses of both plans, and pro-
voked much applause at the ease with
which they led the Emory debators into
deadly dilemmas.

J. K. Orr, who presided in the absence
of Dr. Gaines, then gave the decision in
witty speech, the vote being three to
two in favor of the affirmative.

Delightful features of the evening
were two musical numbers by the Agnes
Scott quartet and a vocal solo by Miss
Lysbeth Pendleton. ‘These were greatly
applauded. Immediately following the
debate an informal reception was given
by the Propylean and) = Mnemosynean
Literary Societies, which proved a most
enjovable event. “Vhe Agnes Scott girls
were charming hostesses and were most
generous in their hospitalitv. Davidson
wishes to exnress their sincere tharrks to
them and to the faculty, as well as to
the Davidson Alumni Association, for
their splendid treatment and hearty in
terest and support. “Those af the Dav-
idson student body who were fortunate
enough to attend the debate are haping
for another one in Georgia next vedr.
