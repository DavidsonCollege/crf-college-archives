Co-captains Nazemetz and Schiavi anticipate wins

By JIGGY MAXWELL
For the past three seasons defensive
tackle Ken Nazemetz (6'-1", 225) and
strong safety/linebacker Harry Schiavi
(5'-9", 185) have been the core of the

Davidson. defense. Their teammates’

honored this commitment last year by
electing them as co-captains for the
1989 season.

Nazemetz, a psychology major from
Warren, New Jersey, has been a team
leaderin tackles and sacks for his entire
career. It was his play, as well as that of
the rest of the line, that caused teams to
move away from the. run against the
Wildcats in 1988.

Schiavi, an economics major from
Wilmington, Delaware, has come back
from an injury-plaguéed 1988 season

and moved from strong safety to line-
backer. Schiavi plays with a hard-nosed
determination and an almost brutal love
for hard hits that will-surely lead to suc-
cess in his new position.

Both players were deeply honored to be
chosen as: co-captains for this season.
“ After all,” said Schiavi, “that’s not some-
body punching typewriter keys for the

paper...that’s the guys you work with in |

practice every day recognizing what
you’ve done over the years.”
Nazemetz echoed that sentiment.
“Being named co-captain was probably
one of my highest moments at Davidson,”
he said. He also commented that he has
enjoyed playing with his friends and
teammates and working with the coaches.

“That's what made football fun at

Davidson,” he said.

But as every Wildcat fan knows,
the past three years have seen their
share of disappointment, not the
least of which was the Trustee deci-
sion to drop football to Division III.
Both Nazemetz and Schiavi ex-
pressed their distaste for that deci-
sion.

“But 1989 is a clean slate,” de-
clared Schiavi, “and I think we an-

swered a lot of questions about this ball
club on Saturday against Millsaps.”

“This year,” Nazemetz predicted,
“the fans that come out and support us
are definitely going tosee some wins on
the board...it’s up to us to be the best
Division III football team we can be.”

If these two determined co-captains
have anything to do with it, the rest of
the season could look much like Satur-
day’s win.
