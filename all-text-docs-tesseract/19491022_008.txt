team, and start practice. After he
gets things pretty well osganized,
he is in a position to start a club
and have the boys elect officers.
On days that the boys are unable
to play football, or any time they:
may want to plan extra activities,
they may have a club meeting. This
gives the boys a chanice to partici-
pate in group discussions and group
planning, -as well as bringing the

group closer together.

This year the Y hopes to have
many more activities for the boys,
If possible we plan to have a father
and son banquet in the communi-
ties, and possibly some weekend ac-
tivities. We are setting up a league
between the three towns, and plan
to give the winning team some
award. In addition to their league
games, however, the teams will play
some of the Y teams in Charlotte,
and some of the teams in Moores-
ville. In these various activities we
hope to influence the boys for
strong character and good health.

for the spectators. How amusing
this is to us when we remember
the times that we have pushed and
shoved our way to this balcony
‘only to find that we were lucky to
get a seat on the floors so as to
dangle our legs over the edge. Da
vidson has certainly outgrown this
building and we have lived to see
a magnificent edifice erected in its

place.

We can read the accounts which
appeared in 1917, and we can look
on the building which they erected,
but as.we face this building today,
and then cast our eyes slightly to
the left we see the structure which,
in itself; is the very symbol of
progress at Davidson. We sce a
building which has so far outstrip-
ped this old gym that comparison
of the two would only entail ab-
surdities. We see a building which
was made. possible through the
efforts of these same men who
were so proud of their building in
1917, for only through their efforts,
and the help of the many friends
of Davidsan College were we able
to have such a building which will
measure up to the full expectations
and delight of all of us on this day
in 1949, and which exceeds the
fondest dreams of 1917,

team. If the above mentioned facts
aren’t enough to demoralize a
squad, we've got a lot to learn about
the “whys” and “wherefores’’ of the
game of football.
BETAS HAVE IT THIS YEAR
' From this stage of the season, it
looks as though the Betas will
breeze to the championship in the
Interfraternity Football race. .With
the season half over, the powerful
Betas have raced through all op-
position with ease and should go to
the distance undefeated. The K.
A.'s, last year champs, took like a
sure thing for the second-place
berth. A battle royal for the remain-
ing three upper slots is being stag-
ed, with the three to probably come
from the S.A.E.’s, Phi Delts, Pikas
and Kappa Sigs. While we're on
the subject of fraternity football,
you fraternity sports managers
start thinking about your selections
for the All-Frat team which will be
selected at the close of the current
campaign.

tion, Thus we have slipped back,
as it is so easy to do, without
arousing that inner prick of con-
science which gives warning of
retrogression in the sins of com-

mission.

Now what, exactly, has chapel
conduct got to do with all this?
The writer feels that chapel con-
duct is simply an irrefutable in.
dication of the general deadening
to spiritual values with which the
college is here indicted. It is thus
an effect and not a cause. Why
has it not improved? Because, as
so often happens, the effect has
been mistaken for the cause. For
some time there has been much
exhortation of the student body to
exhibit more spirit in respect to
the activities of the fooball team.
The lack of spirit in this case was,
again, an effect and not a cause.
Spirit was not iacking when David-
son recently trounced State, but it
must be emphasized that spirit
cannot be created by oratory, no
must arise, as it did in the State
matter how masterful it may be. It
game, of itself. To return to chapel
conduct, it, like the spirit of the
student body in relation to our
team, is an effect. Wherein, then,
lies the cause. This queston has,
the, writer believes, already been
adequately answered. And now you
will undoubtedly wish to know
what can be done about reawaken-

that can be applied with such just-
ness to the school at this time.
The answer is, of course, that no
one, two, three series of concrete
proposals can be made to remedy
the present lack.

Then what is to be done? As in
the case of an individual, the writer
feels that the only course is to
consciously effect. an ‘introspective
exainination of what has caused this
unconscious hypocrisy and, having
done this, to seriously and rever-
ently make a rededication of an
active sort to the principles which
have made Davidson great.

No amount of outward adher-
ence to Davidson's purpose as it
is stated in the catalogue can make
the fulfitlment of that purpose a
reality. To make of it a reality,
there must be an inward dedication
on the part of student body and
administration alike. Each one of
us who is a part of this college
must feel that it is a personal re-
sponsibility to make Davidson’s
ideals live,‘and each one of us must
start at home, must make of our-
selves a true synthesis of what
Davidson collectively stands for.
Truly, let us have, “No More
Chapel Editorials.” Let us have
no’ more general exhortations to
one another to actively dedicate
ourselves to the things Davidson
stands for. Let us instead, start
with ourselves, remedy our individ-
ual. faults, asd correct our own
shortcomings. When that has been
done by each of us, then it will no
longer be ‘necessary to publish let-
ters about chapel conduct and
Davidson College will truly be the
great Christian coliege which it
was in the days of our forbears.

feeble argument that represents the
desperation of the admirals. That
failing, they turned their tactics to
discrediting the bomb itself. They
have called it inhuman and _ bar-
baric. and have pooh-poohed it as
a decisive factor in war. Yet they
have taken care to keep the result:

tt all adds up to the fact that the
margin of victory in the next war

‘will lie in the hands of the side

with the superior air force. The Air
Force is not and does not claim to
be a short cut to victory, a quick,
easy way to win a war; there is

none. But the Air Force will hold

the center of attention, and the
Navy can't stand the thought of
being pushed aside.

through the crowd and quickly
mounted the running board of an

he raised his hand, the cry of the
