NUMBER FIFTEEN

Somnolent Students Rise
To Meet Suitcase Invasion

A sparsely attended Midwin-
ters weekend is kicked off to-
night with an 8 p.m. IFC con-
cert by Stan Rubin and The
Tigertown Five in Chambers
auditorium.

“This is the smallest Midwin-
ters that I can remember,”
Dorm Superintendent Mrs. J. B.
Moore reported this Wednesday.
“The dorms are full, but there
is only a small waiting list. And
there is a waiting list only be-
cause some special campus
guests are keeping girls in the
dorms.”

The other IFC entertainment
will be a concert by folk-singer
Odetta in Chambers tomorrow
night at 8 p.m. The IFC has
scheduled no on-campus dances
this weekend, so Lingle Manor
plans to make up for the deficit
tomorrow evening with a private
square dance in the Morrison
Room of the Union after the
Odetta concert.

Off-campus dancing is another
matter. All the fraternities have
after-parties scheduled to run
into the early-morning hours.

Only this time they're ‘after-con-

cert parties.

Three groups of students may
find the weekend hard to enjoy!

Greek Week Skits
Skip Into Oblivion

Skit night, a part of Greek
Week activities for several)
years, has been abolished. In|
action taken during last Mon-
day night’s meeting, the IFC
ruled against its continuance.

IFC President Johnny Rodgers |
stated that the council felt that)
the skits were serving no real |
purpose as they were and that}
they ought to be replaced with |
something more beneficial and
more unifying to the pledge!
classes as a whole. |

Although no decision has |
been reached, he indicated |
that a pledge track meet or a |
pledge sing is being consider- |
ed.

In an attempt to put some-
thing in the place of the skits |
and also to suggest other need-,
ed changes, the IFC has set up|
a committee, headed by Haynes |
Kelly, this year's Greck Week |
chairman. Using the commit: |
tee’s recommendations, the IFC |
hopes to improve the Greek
Week program for next year.

As far as this year’s pledge
projects were concerned, Rod-
gers said, “This is the best
year we have ever had. The
projects have been better. The
relations between Davidson
and the surrounding com-
munities have been greatly
improved, and our publicity
was very good.”

He added that no fines had
been levied on any fraternity
during the week.

Soon to be announced is the
award for the best pledge class
of the year. A committee of five
members has been appointed to
make the decision, which will
be announced within the next
few weeks.

ed for next Tuesday. The review
was originally scheduled for to-
morrow morning, but the facul-
ty, perceiving the conflict,
changed the day.

The basketball team won't be
partying much, either, if it
wants to be in shape for its
game with Georgia Southern to-
morrow night in Statesboro, Ga.
The team apparently couldn’t
keep its mind on its game over
Midwinters last year, and drop-
ped a contest to Erskine in Gas-
tonia

The track team is also a vic-
tim of conflicting schedules. It
participates in the Big Five
Track Meet tomorrow afternoon
at Chapel Hill.

The weekend will close out
Sunday afternoon with a cham-
ber music coneert in Hodson

Hall at 4 by Derry Deane, Roger
Drinkall, Keith Bryan, and Kar-
en Keys. Vespers Sunday night
centers on the Universal Day of
Prayer observance sponsored by
the YMCA.

Rubin and his Tigertown Five,
are a Dixieland jazz group that’
has grown from a group by the’

same name that he started in;

1953 while a freshman at Prince
ton University. His group has
appeared at Carnegie Hall and
the Newport Jazz Festival, tour-
ed in Europe, and was the only
American band to play at Grace
Kelly’s wedding

Odetta has appeared at var
ious night clubs around the
country and in two motion piec-’
tures, “Cinerama Holiday” and
“Sanctuary.” She has also. pro-|
duced a number of’ albums. {

Woodsman Didn't Figure
In Red Riding Hood's Fate

BY RICK von UNWERTH
Davidsonian Feature Writer
It was a cold, grey afternoon in February and Little
Red Riding Hood stuck a mittened hand into one of the;
pockets of her polo coat. “I wonder how much farther to

ta?

Gram’s” she thought.

Just outside the city limits of
a tiny town, she spied a fun-
looking truck stop, and in sore
need of a breather, she pulled
her little’ red Sprite off the
highway.

Inside the inn, Red absorbed
the homey warmth and her little
red nostrils picked up on the
spoor of frying bologna. The
dancing lights of the Miller
High Life sign over the counter
made Red grin, and she ordered

la short one. “Put a burger on

me, too,” she told the lady,
“with pickles and onion.”

“Onions aren‘t cool, doll,”
said a deep, lazy voice be-
hind her. Red teased her fore
lock coyly and looked around.
The Wolf eased out of a cor-
ner booth and shuffled over
to her, with a big smile that
showed good teeth. His dark
mane was swept casually a-
cross his forehead.

“You look kinda like Ken-
nedy,”’ she said, and giggled into
a daintily poised hand.

“It’s a going thing,” he smil-
ed. “But who are you?”

“Red Riding Hood,” she said.
“I'm down from Winston to
visit my Grandma. She's got
mono, and I brought her a bas-
ket of ribs and some toddy ma-
terial to help drive away the
chill. She lives in a town called
Davidson. Is that far from
here?”

“No,” said the Wolf, “and
your timing is terrific. Ill
lead you to the crone’s place
later, but. first let’s run over
to a Greek lunchroom | know
about. Swing season is in, and
they’re our kind of people.”

Sensing an adventure, Red
gave in. The Wolf seemed sharp
enough, and Gram, though sweet

and wealthy, was categorically a

fink for social purposes
*

*

His car was low and fast,
and they were there in no
time. He pulled up in front
of a neat brick number, one
of a string of same, each
bearing a Greek legend.

“They're all alike,” she said.

“No, Doll,” said the Wolf.
“This one is swing-oriented, far
cooler than the multitude.” And
they went in.

Through a haze of camel and
maize she saw a smoky piano
and a smoky pianist, two saxes,
and a throbbing guitar. She
felt a wave of frenetic rhythm
and looked up at the Wolf.

“The skin man is tough,” she
said. “You were right—I'm pret-
ty much moved by the whole
scene. What’s the occasion?”

“Dance Weekend,” he said.
“Dances are out, but the par-
ty runs til Sunday. You game,
doll?”

“Take my hand,” she said, |
“I'm a stranger in paradise.”

The Wo!f fell to with a bottle
of joy and they got underway |
forthwith. Red was straight,
with smooth twist action and a
facile command of the UT.|
“You're cool, Red,” said the|
Wolf. And so she was.

® * *

A little later, a day or so,
Red gave him her little grin. |
“Wolf,” she said, “you know

the script, and | gotta split for
Grandma's shortly. But let's
twist again, after the manner |
of last summer's stuff.” y

But lo, the Wolf's face as-;
sumed a pallor.

“That Fox popcorn, Wolf?”
she said, wise and with a tactful

cover gambit.
“Yes,” said the Wolf. “A

Nitish C. LaHarry came to
Davidson with some impressive
credentials. He is the first non-
Caucasian ever to be elected
president of Rotary Internation-
al, that vast organization of
businessmen that has 11,400
clubs in 128 countries with a
membership of 53,000. He is a
native of India, where he held
the office of manager for Co-
lumbia Pictures in Calcutta for
25 years, before retiring, in
1959.

It was evident at the degin-
ning of his address that some

Writers Compete |
To Win Bell Prize

Competition for the Vereen
Bell Memorial Award for Crea-
tive Writing will begin next
week, and entries must reach;
some member of the English:
Department by Monday, April 8.

This year’s award carries a
cash prize of $75.00 for the win-
ner. The winner, together with
honorary recognition to other
ranking contestants, will be \an-
nounced at student assembly in
conjunction with the annual
address provided by the Memor-
ial Fund.

The judge for the 1963 contest
will be Reynolds Price. Each
entrant must comply with the’
following rules:

1. Any regularly enrolled
student of Davidson College is
eligible to compete.

2; All entries must be the
original work of their respective
entrants and may fall in any
recognized category of creative
writing: viz., essay, short story,
drama, poetry, etc.

3. A student may submit en-
tries in as many different cate
gories as he wishes, but he may
submit ene entry only in cach
category with the exception of
poetry. In poetry, the student
may enter one poem or a se-
quence of poems; if he submits
more than one poem he must
designate them as one unit and
so enter them.

4. All entries must be typed,
double spaced, and appear on
one side of the paper only.

had talked with him about the
many “accomplishments” of
Davidson and left the facts very
unclear in his mind. For in-
stance, he complimented us for
giving Woodrow Wilson to the
world when actually we only
gave something to him—a_ case
of T.B. It should be brought out
for all freshmen who are stil!
steeped in orientation beliefs
that the late President left after
his first year here. And he then
ended up in the White House

it is also untrue that David-
son “has given more Rhodes
scholars to the world than
any institution in the coun-
try,” as Mr. LaHarry so filat-
teringly put it; Davidson can
be justly proud of standing
in the top ten of the liberal
arts colleges that can claim
Rhodes scholars.

But when the little Oriental
finished his attempt to flatter
his audience, he began to delve
in the realm of mankind and the
world, And it was in this region
that LaHarry proved himself a
master. He made many provo-
cative statements such as, “This
community (the U.S.) is bound-
ed by the entire world despite
natural and artificial barriers.”

He further emphasized the
preceding statement with the.
words, “The gospel of knowing |
one another as much as we pos-
sibly can is the only way we
can realize the gospel of hu
manity. At no time in the his-
tory of the world is internation-
al understanding more import-}
ant to you and me, the people
of the free world.”

LaHarry emphasized that
the main Rotary goal could be
found in their motto: “Serv-
ice above self.” And truly,
as he made clear over and
over again, this devout Hindu
believes in the spirit that is
in man. He made mention of
this spirit many times in his
assembly talk and afterward
in his informal — discussion
with students.

But the little man with the
quiet voice who believes in man-
kind also has a pinch of stee!
spun into his backbone. He
made this clear when he com-
mented about India's apparent

Western camp, “The trend now

seems to be that we'll have to} —

take sides in the cold war.”

He said that he would be
willing to fight to preserve
the free way of life found in
his country and the United
States. He feels that it is im-
possible for the Communists
to make much peaceful head-

way in India because “the
people are too individualis-
tic.”

In regard to student questions
from the floor after his assem-
bly talk, LaHarry showed that
he could readily think on his
feet. He commented on every-
thing from the caste system in
India to the mythical “sacred
cow.” He said that rural educa-
tion would eventually stamp out
the caste system which contin-
ues to exist in isolated areas be-
cause of ignorance and custom.

And he defended India's posi-
tion in Goa by saying, “Isn't
everything relative in
world? Why blame us in taking
a natural and logical step when
the majority of people in that
section (Goa) wanted it?”

“An architect has been work-

ported. The Trustees will be

Faculty Queried
On Christian Oath

The faculty expressed its
opinion Tuesday in its monthly
meeting on the long-embattled
oath required of all full pro-
fessors upon their inauguration.
But the results will be kept
secret until President D. G.
Martin can present them to the
trustees next Wednesday.

in other significant action, the
faculty voted to change the reso-

lution which limits fraternities
to one official function a semes-
jter. The new rule permits a
‘traternity to have unlimited of-
| ficial functions in a. semester;
‘but. as in the past, such fune-
| tions must be chaperoned by
members of the faculty and ad-
ministration

The faculty was not polled in
a simple manner by which they
could vote for or against the
oath. _ Rather, a questionnaire
was passed to each person at
the meeting which contained
several alternatives concerning
ithe oath. THE DAVIDSONIAN
}learned the content of four of
the alternatives. which ranged
all the way from making the
present oath stronger to doing
away with it completely.

Heading the list was the pro-
posal to make the oath stronger
in its present form.

Secondly, there was a pro-
posal to keep the oath exact-
ly as it is new and continue to
have full professors take it
during the annual commence-
ment when they ere inaugur-

ated.
