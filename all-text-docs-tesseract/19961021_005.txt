Question of
the week:

One senior asks: Why: were
chalk boards in Chambers re-
placed with white boards?

Three math professors, Dr.
L.R. King, Dr. Benjamin Klein,
and Dr. Irl Bivens, have different
views on the new boards, but all
three say that they prefer the
boards — or do not have any
preference.

The white boards have some
definite advantages over chalk
boards. As King explains, “It’s
not a matter of which board I
prefer, but rather that white boards
are necessary if you want to use a

computer in the room, because
chalk boards can get dust in the
computer.”

Klein adds, “the boards allow
you to use multiple colored mark-
ers, which the chalk board could
never do effectively. Also, you
can use a projector on the white
boards.”

However, there are also nega-
tive aspects of having white boards.
As Klein states, “White boards
can’t becleaned properly, and they
do wear out. Eventually they will
need to be replaced.”

Bivens adds that “the boards

Professors in the department
voiced no strong preference for
either type of board. Bivens says,
“The white boards aren’t bad, as
long as the smell of the markers
doesn’t bother you. I have no
strong preference”

Klein adds, “If I had to vote I
would choose white boards, but
it’s a close call.”

Campus Police
extend towing
mortatorium

By IAN HuUMMEL
Staff Writer

After assessing the results of
the two week towing mortatorium,
Campus Police have decided they

' will not tow students illegally

parked in faculty spots until the
end of the school year.

Campus Police reviewed the
two-week trial period proposed by
Student Advisory Council co-chair
Lucian Dervan ‘98 to Ray Thrower,
Director of Public Safety, in which
towing would be replaced by tick-
ets and fines. :

They found that during the
moratorium there was an increase
in the number of illegally parked
cars

However, the increase was

. deemed not substantial enough to

make them tow again.

“Tf it [the illegal parking] re-
ally goes up heavily this year, we
may have to readdress this issue
next school year,” said Thrower.

He also said that the campus
police are attempting to make the

parking policy “as liberal as pos-
sible,” but it is fundamental that
the students work with the police
for any policy to be effective.

Dervan was pleased with the
decision to extend the non-towing
policy.

““That’s excellent,” he said,
That’s what we were hoping for.”

The Advisory Council hopes
that newly placed signs in the park-
ing lots will help que!! the parking
problem, but the the sticcess of the
policy likely hinges on the effec-
tiveness of the lesser deterrent of
tickets to prevent unlawful park-
ing. 7

In the case of an escalation in
the problem, Anne Ford, co-chair
of the Advisory Council, said a
compromise may have to be made
such as towing a car after the third
parking offense.

Fornow, however, Dervan and
Ford are pleased that the student —
concerns have been addressed and
hope that the problem will not cause
thy, towing to be implemented
again. :

International house plans will not surface soon

By JoHN DuUNWoopDyY
Staff Writer

As Davidson’s international
student population has grown over
the years, an idea to have a house
for international students was born.
The International House had hopes
of being similar in some aspects to
the Black Student Coalition and at

the same time maintaining its own
unique flair.

However, plans for the Inter-
national House are not going to
surface this year.

Last year a submission was
made by Dr. Kenneth Brown, Di-
rector of the Dean Rusk Program,
for the house. The International
House would have been located in

a Davidson-owned residence on
Main Street.

Brown’s proposal will not be
implemented for a number of rea-
sons, one of which was a lack of
funds.

Departments that were sup-
porting the proposal did not have
enough money to cover the costs.
In addition, the new Student Union,

Student selectivity: Davidson ranks 9th

By JENNIFER STARR
Staff Writer

Students’ decisions of where
to apply and to attend determine
the student se-
lectivity portion
of US News’
ranking criteria.

Two years
ago, Davidson
ranked sixth in student selectivity.
Due to aslight fall in the number of
applications, Davidson was elev-
enth last year. This year Davidson

plications acollege receives, yield
(the percentage of students offered
admission that choose to accept),
the middle 50% of SAT/ACT
scores, and the percentage of fresh-
man in the top 10% of their gradu-
ating class.

Mild variations in number of
applications and yield cause
Davidson’s student selectivity rat-
ing to fluctuate slightly from year
to year.

Admissions does not expect
any substantial changes in
Davidson’s student selectivity

before, but the number of applica-
tions is down slightly.

Does Davidson’s ranking as
eleventh liberal arts college in the
US News and World Reportsurvey
really matter to a prospective stu-
dent? According to the Depart-
ment of Admissions, it depends on
the student.

Dean of Admissions Nancy
Cable explains, “Some students
rely heavily on rankings like the
one in US News and World Report.
Other students understand that
ranking is a poor measure of how

rose to ninth. ranking. appropriate a certain institution is

Town restructures Main Street parking policy

cord Road. Whether students di-
rectly affected the change, how-
ever, is another question.

Senators Sara Straus and Kurt
Fesemeyer agree that students had
little direct input in the revision.

"When I called Mr. Brice be-
fore break," Straus says, "they had
already made the decision."

She finds no fault with the
lack of town-gown communica-
tion, however,-since-the town's pri-

mary focus is its commerce.
"They're concerned that their busi-
nesses are happy," she says.

SGA President Warren Buford
believes student, voices in Town
Hall will be louder in the future.

“Where I do think we have
made significant steps," he says,
"is with Sara and Kurt going to
begin the initial discussions with
Mr. Brice and others on the town
council about setting up and

structuralizing some sort of stu-

Buford says the SGA consid-
ers dialogue with the town to be

“one of the top priorities this se- —

mester.”

To encourage discussion, the
SGA is planning around table din-
ner with the Mayor’s office.

_ “It’s something not only nec-
essary, but would be very advanta-
geous, I believe, to students as well
as town council members.I hope
that they would welcome it and

would be as excited... as we are,”

Buford says.

which will be built at some point in
the coming years, will have an
area designated solely for Interna-
tional Student use.

The area in the new Union and
the house would be very similar.

Davidson does not want to
have duplicated areas, which would

‘likely occur if International House

plans go through.

Ruth Pittard states, “It takes a
while for any project to get started.
Last year was the first year that this
proposal was made”. —

“The refusal does not mean
that the project will never come
about, if the interest remains high
proposals will continue to be
made,” she says.
