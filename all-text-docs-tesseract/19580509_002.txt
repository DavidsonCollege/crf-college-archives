Revised Bidding a Must for ‘58

The passage of the Revised Bid-
ding System (see page one) will in-
sure the Davidson fraternity system
a long and stable future. No more
important issue has faced the College
fraternities within the past fifty
years.

As stated by the authors, the pur-
pose of the system is two fold. First,
and we think obvious, the new houses
on Patterson Fraternity Court have
been built to comfortably accommo-
date 60 to 65 men. It seems ridiculous
to crowd 85 to 90 in one or two, and
have only 25 men using several
others. More important, the even-
tual evening out in the size of the fra-
ternities offer numerous intangible
benefits. Competition between all
twelve of the fraternities will become
much keener in interfraternity activi-
ties, the development of meaningful
friendships will become easier as the
behmouths of the system are gradual-
ly whittled down to size. and the pos-
sibility that a fraternity lose its char-
ter because of small membership will
be virtually eliminated.

We have studied the plan careful-
ly. discussed it, criticized it. tested it
in almost every. hypothetical situa-
tion imaginable. and find it to be
sound and workable.

Some have complained that fra-
ternities will lose their basic rights
if, the Revised Plan is approved. We
think not. In no situation will a fra-

ternity be forced to take a pledge
that has not been properly bid. Any
number of bids may be issued. No
person or group of persons, except
the fraternities and the freshmen will
decide “who goes where.” The me-
chanics of Revised Bidding are pure-
ly mathematical. The only real limita-
tion is that of number, and this is a
negative limitation to the benefit of
the individual fraternities and the sys-
tem.

During the coming week there will
be much discussion of the matter.
This is well. No change so important
should be undertaken without care-
ful consideration by all involved.

But. next week will also be the
time to act. Fall of 1958. bringing
with it the new fraternity court, is
the logical time to make, such a
change. If this opportunity passes, an-
other year’s apathy and indifference
may bury it forever:

The DAVIDSONIAN urges that all
concerned carefully study the Re-
vised Plan. A large part of the op-
position voiced to date has come from
those who lack a full understanding
of the new system.

If the Revised System is approved,
and the DAVIDSONIAN hopes strong:
ly that it is, there will be ample proof
that Davidson students can think
clearly and with open minds about
the most important of student mat-
ters.

Poll Shows
Flaws in System

One valuable criterion for evalu-
ating the worth of an educational sys-
tem is the opinion of those students
who are performing best under it.
In the poll of the top five students
in each class taken this week by the
DAVIDSONIAN {see page one).
opinions of the Davidson system were
highly varied, but the large number—
on some questions a majority — of
highly critical answers indicates that
an “agonizing reappraisal” is in or-
der.

For example, only about a. third
of the students questioned thought
that most of the academic work here
was intellectually stimulating, and
more than a third regarded most of
it as dull “busy work’ and memoriza-
tion. This opinion has, of course. been
held widely by students not included
in. this poll. but to see many of the
top men in each class express doubts
concerning the quality of the educa-
tion they are receiving ts rather un-
settling. If they. who have demon-
strated both their ability and their
willingness to do what is demanded of
them. have not profited from their
Study here. who can?

It should now be fully apparent
that Davidson—despite all the propa-
ganda (strictly for outside consump-
tion) in the College Catalogue about
“the training of the mind” in order
to provide ‘‘a knowledge of the forces
which have determined the pattern
of our civilization” and thereby
“fostering the understanding which
gives meaning and purpose to the
present’—is failing to live up. to its
promises.

Davidson is a good place for a
student who wants nothing more than
a first-class ticket to financial securi-
ty and social position and is willing
to endure a little intellectual discom-
fort on the way. but it has acute limi-
tations for those who want more than
this. .

There are a few bright spots, how-

ever. Some science departments (e.g.,
mathematics, chemistry, and pre-med)
provide an adequate technical back-
ground for further study, and some
of the humanities are generally quite
well taught (e.g. history). Honor
courses are well regarded by those
majoring in English or history

Seminar courses in such depart-
ments as philosophy, psychology, and
economics provide, in a very limited
way, relief from the tedium of or-
dinary course work.

Most important and most promis-
ing of all, some individual professors
are attempting to raise the level of
their courses in such a way that a
challenge will be presented to stu-
dents who are willing to work for
goals worth achieving but are fed up
with organized dullness. In the long
run, this is the only way that David-
son can begin to realize its avowed
ideals. —C.H.C.

First Lady
Of Davidson

In accordance with Mother’s Day
this Sunday it is fitting that The DA-
VIDSONIAN salute Mrs, J. B. Moore,
our Mom Away from Home in our
Home Away from Home.

As Housemother and Supervisor
of Dormitories. Mrs. Moore has been
willing and happy to help students
with any prohlem in her office on

the first floor of Belk. The cheerful,
efficient manner in which she has

performed her myriad of duties is on-
ly a reflection of her natural love and
concern for boys.

From sitting up at all hours on
dance weckends to the task of as-
signing rooms Mrs. Moore has con-
stantly been on the go. Her work has

not been of the impersonal sort, for
many of the students recognize her

quality and often can be seen enjoy-
ing a friendly chat with the popular
lady.
Without a doubt she is the “first
lady of Davidson” at this time.

PARTICIPATION NEEDED

s Forward to Productive Year

Through Efforts of Entire Student Body

By JOHN KUYKENDALL

1 am glad to have this op-
portunity of making a state-
ment of the goals or objectives
which t hope to see accom-
plished next year through the
endeavors of your Student
Council as it works with and
for the Davidson Student.

First of all, I wish to thank
you, the Davidson Student
Body, for the excellent Student
Council you have elected to
work with me in representing
you next year. Each one of
these men is dedicated sincere-
ly to the work which lies ahead.
I am deeply grateful for the
privilege of working with four-
teen men of such caliber on the
Student Council next year.

The one idea which will, to
a large extent, pervade the ac-
tions of your Student Council
next year will be the attempt

to bring Davidson Student and
Davidson Student Council clos-
er together. You will notice an
attempt to bring more students
into the sphere of interest and
labor provided by student gov-
ernment here at Davidson.

I should like to state very
briefly some of projects and
problems we hope to approach
in the coming year.

HONOR COUNCIL

Preliminary plans for the
proposed Honor Council have
already been made by the re-
tiring Student Council. It is
our present intention to com-
plete the mechanics of this pro-
ject and introduce the recom-
mended organiaztion to the Stu-
dent Body in the early fall. This
whole proposal would represent
a very significant and, I be-
lieve, beneficial change in the
organization of Student Govern-

ment here at Davidson. Natural-
ly, we wish to approach the
Student Body to understand the
proposal thoroughly and ask
any questions which might oc-
cur. Therefore, it is my inten-
tion to request that the Student
Council sponsor one or more
forums of an informal nature
for the explanation and discus-
sion of this system after its
initial presentation.

With regard to the drinking
situation, the position which I
took during the election cam-
paign remains unchanged. I do
not believe it practical or feasi-
ble to attempt any return to
a more conservative interpreta-
tion of our present student
body regulations. On the other
hand, I feel that any further
liberalization of the law in the
direction of allowing drinking
on campus or allowing men to
return under the influence of

SALMAGUNDI

Thoughts of a Senior

J D.C. Society

By JOHN TOUMARAS

This week “Salmagundi” is
devoted to the thoughts of one
who. is soon fo bid farewell to
the ivied icons of Davidson. The
following is goodbye frem a
happy senior.

Byron is. dead. ,Keats and
Sheliey lasted longer, but they,
too, are dead. The death of
these men is complete. Long
‘live industry. super highways,
and Davidson's, god. the Intel-
lectual. Shame upon anyone who
would aspire to capture again
the Romantic spirit. Romanti-
cism is. the waste of time: the
leech of the industrious spirit;
the death of science and her
hetl-hound, Reason.

You, Oh mighty Intellect,
have remade the world.
You, Oh squint-eyed Rea-
son, have progressed and
progressed; and far off in
the future you will still be
progressing. You will rol!
your little rock up that long
hill a million years after
we, your living sons, are
dust brushed lovingly from
the tombs of some prophet °
of those ages yet to be.
Progress, Reason, Intellect
fear not, for unto you will
be born new generations of
worshipers when we are
mute.

In truth, your Spirit is not

to progress. Down with it! It
is false! Love is not complete
in its form as..you are. Chew
up Leve's philosophy and. cast
it aside . . . there is need of
something more. You. Oh Rea-
son, are now king. Long pro-
gress the king!

Romanticism died, but it
did not fail the world. The
world looked blindly at Ro-
manticism’s premises, and
still does with eyes too hu-
man to really see its great-
ness. In its spirit was the
love, most closely expressed
by the greatest of the
world’s teachers. In Ro-
manticism was true hope,
real faith, and a desire for
& great love.

As time passed and as Ro-
manticism died, it became the
target for a great deal of cri-
ticism. Today it. is only smiled
upon and brushed off as a pass-
ing fancy of a few slightly radi-
cal men. Man's desire to know,
to experiment, to push on into
the future. to aspire the God-
head could not long tolerate.
this whimpering Child. And sq
Romanticism was crushed and
left, to die in the cold streets
of. a world built around Rea-

son, Romanticism was forever
a Child. To grow old could nev-
er be its lot. It was, and will
remain the young man who

must die, for the world has no
need of him.

Man will always have an
argument to show why his
feeble mind and its pur-
suits are the real weapons
for giving the world a more

perfect social structure.
Man will continue to see
Progress moving on a

straight line into the dark
future, unrelentingly. For
anyone to call his attention
to the fact that progress
is nothing more than a
continuing procession
around a center point will
forever be blasphemy. He
cannot believe fhat his new
discoveries are only new
points on the circumfer-
ance of a little circle, and
that since time began man
has never moved one inch
from the locus of this cir-
cle.

As graduation approaches we
smile and muse wistfully to
ourselves, “Now we are men.
we have put away childish
things. The Romantic
was of our youth and is now
passed away!” Run the good
race, Davidson Gentleman of
1958 and: if you must sacrifice
love for reason, hope for prac-
ticality, or peace for war, do
so knowing that you are living
up to the truth you learned
here.”

FLURRY OF WINGS, THEY

spirit

alcohol would not be com-
mensurate, either with the at-
mosphere of education or with
the standards of Davidson Col-

lege. I believe that proper ad-
ministration and interpretation
of the present rule is possible,
and it is my hope that the
Student Council will move in
this direction in the next year.
I have high hopes for the suc-
cess and value of the recently
established Student-Faculty-
Trustee committee on the
drinking situation which has
met twice in the past three
weeks. We have been fortunate
in finding a representative dele-
gation from the students, giving
the liberal as well as the con-
servative student point of view.
This will furthermore give
some indication. 4s to what the
future holds for us in regard to
this problem.

Another facet of Davidson
campus life which warrants the
study of the Student Council in
the coming year is our system
of elections. It is my idea to
appoint the elections committec

comparatively early in the year
to work with a Student Council
committee on elections and fa-
cilitate a complete and de-
liberate study of our entire clec-
tions set-up, leaving time to
take action on suggestions be-
fore the spring elections period.

PARTICIPATION

In closing, may I reemphasize
the statement which points up
the program for the coming
year. It is my purpose to at-
tempt to draw the Davidson
Student into interest and par-
ticipation in Student Council
work. This is not only beneficial
to the student himself, but to
the school as a_ whole. I am
available and anxious to receive
any suggestions from any stu-
dent concerning the operation
of our student government in
the coming year, and I look
forward to a year of progress,
not through the efforts of any
One individual or small group
or individuals, but through the
efforts of the Student Body of
Davidson College as a whole.

CHAPERONS

By TENNEY DEANE
Now that the school is in the capable hands of the
new Student Council, Y.M.C.A., and I.F.C., the student body
can relax until the BIG question is answered—Who will
be the next president of Davidson College?

This is the weekend that Queens has been waiting for
all year! The fact that nine Davidson fraternities are
having functions tomorrow is making it possible for al-
most the whole student body to date. Another peculiar
situation exists in the difficulty in securing chaperons for

these parties.

Did anyone mention the Davidson value pattern?
A closer observation of the Davidson gentleman during
the next couple of weeks will show a very altered set of
ideas. For example, a nine o'clock break in the Union
will take the place of the usual nine o'clock flick.

I know 18 boys who think that Mrs. Moore is the
best “Mom” in Davidson. We certainly thank her for the
work she did in getting Martin’s Manor back for us.

Last Wednesday afternoon, the arousing strains of the
Davidson Fight Song brought dozens of sleepy-eyed boys
to their windows and prepared them for the news of
the Cats’ Southern Conference golf victory. The fact that
this public address system has not been used for quite
a while is a fairly good indication that perhaps it wasn’t
needed anyhow. The only time that I can remember it
being used was to make the announcement concerning
the cancellation of Homecoming and the results of a cou-
ple of football games which were played here. One pos-
sibility for its use would be to let Radio Free Davidson

broadcast over its facilities.

Overheard at the discussion with Mr. John Page,
Wetzel‘s lawyer, last Wednesday night, “We want Frank!”

LETTER TO EDITOR

Let's Take Stock

Dear Editor:

As we approach the end of
another school year it might be
a good idea if we all take stock
of what we have done. It may
be that some will find that they
have accomplished much and
given freely of their talents,
but others may not be so pleased
with their views of retrospect.
This has been a year of much
action around Davidson Col-
lege. Many can look back and
point with pride to activities
with which they. have been as-
sociated.

Our athletic teams have done
well; the IFC, under the fine
leadership of Bob Jones, has
ahead by Jeaps

moved and

bounds: Ross Smyth's Student
Council. has performed ade-
quately under some. difficult
pressures; and even the Execu-
tive Committee of the Faculty
can look back with pride on
a year of many decisions
(though not all popular).

But where do we, the average
student, lacking of athletic
prowess and great leadership
ability fit into the picture?
Where have we left our mark
on Davidson's school year. 1957-
1958?

The tact ss that many of us,
too many, have let another un-
productive year slip by, con-
tent to sit back and criticize.
but not sufficiently moved to
try to accomplish anything. We,
should actually place the blame
on our own shoulders for not
attempting to right the wrongs
which we so dearly love to ex-
toll upon.

Let us afl take it upon our-—
selves next year, whether: at
Davidson or elsewhere, to take
a working interest in things
that deserve our attention and
our time.
