STUDENTS SCOUR COUNTRY FOR CARS

The. market for automobiles and other
similar forms of transportation is very

Davidson students. All
are subject to the most
rigid search and bargaining for the re-
quired conveyors. The first requisite is
that they be cheap: next important is
that the engine will run with sufficient
coaxing. Little things like flat or blown-
out tires do not hinder the sale in the
least. Those cars with the most delapi-
dated or spectacularly decorated bodies
seem to find the readier sale. However ,

Calhoun made a synopsis of the papers
recently distributed throughout the stu-

made his summary from the average of
about three hundred papers. About five
hundred were distributed in the dormi-
tories but not all were returned. Moral
character proved to be the first requisite
and in the whole
student body. He also gave the data on
what boys from different states thought,
from different different agles,

INFIRMARY REPORT

Th infirmary is at last free of the.
mumps. W. D. Douglas, the last victim |
of this popular disease, left the infirm- |
ary on the second, and it is to be hoped !
that we have seen the last case this |
season, |

The following men have been in the!
infirmary since last week: R. O. Sellars, |
C. V. Smith, W. K. Forbes, V. S. Broy- |
les, C. R. Hunter and C. M. S. McIlwaine. |
Broyles and Hunter are the only inmates |

at present. <o

HANGCHOW COLLEGE
FUND GOES OVER

According to a statement given
out by Mr. J. P. Williams, secre-
tary of the “¥” at Davidson, the
campaign for funds for the Hang-
chow Christian College in China
of which Warren Cox, a former
Davidson man, is an instructor,
went over the top. The subscrip-
tions now stand at thirteen hun-
dred and, fifty dollars. This is
thought to be an extremely gen-
erous contribution when it is taken
into consideration that it was
raised from college boys, and dur-
ing a similar campaign waged by
the Queens canvassers.

his eloquence and logic in concluding the
negative arguments by showing the harmful
effects of the proposed plan and in giving a.
concise summary of the negative arguments.

The clash of the first speeches was en- |
hanced even more by the tire and vigor that
featured the rebuttals. The affirmative or-
der was maintained in the rebuttal, while for |
the negative Bowie, Wharton, and Parker!
spoke in the order named. The final nega- |
tive rebuttal by Parker was a decisive factor
in the outcome of the debate.

Dr. W. HY Frazer, president: of Queens,

presided over the exercises. Harllee Branch,

_ alternate and manager for Davidson, served

as timekeeper.

Following the debate the speakers and au-
dienee were tendered a delightful reception |
by the Queens girls in the college parlors.

A resume of the debate would be incom-
plete without mention of the skillful and in-
defatigable coaching of Prof. Carl Wach- |
ter, who has already won recognition for |
this ability as a forensic pilot since his re-
cent arrival at Davidson,

And he has lived to see it

Back in 1885, Thomas A. Edison succeeded in
transmitting electricity at 220 volts for one mile
—an achievement and a promise.

In 1881 Edison shipped to the
Paris Exposition his “ Jumbo’’
dynamo—eighth wonder of the
world. It could light 1000
lamps. Now there are G-E
generators large enough to sup-
ply current for over’a million
lamps, each with four times the
candle-power of the lamp of
1881.

The General Electric Company
produces other electrical appa-
ratus which makes it possible
to transmit power over great
distances. It has put electricity
in seven-league boots. In its
laboratories, scientists are now
experimenting with voltages

ten times as great as the high- .

est now in use.

If you are interested in learning
more about what electricity is
doing, write for Reprint No.

BLECTRIC

GENERAL

The promise was fulfilled a few months ago,
when electricity at 220,000 volts was transmitted

two hundred and forty

miles to supply Los

Angeles with light and power.

Now five billion dollars are invested in electric

power plants. A stupendous figure that testifies

to the alertness of thousands of college-trained
men who have been leaders in the production
and use of electric power.

The electrical era has only dawned. Each year
some new machine or discovery makes it possible
‘ to apply electricity in unexpected ways. The
graduate of today*will find electricity directly
or indirectly a means for even greater accom-
plishments, no matter what his calling in life

may be.
