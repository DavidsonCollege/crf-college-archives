focused on was housing. The
report specified the
desirability of small group
campus housing without a
sizable increase in dorm rent.
Also recommended was that
game rooms, ice and vending
machines, bath and lounge
facilities, and telephone ser-
vice be either improved, in-
creased or provided in the
various dorms.

Other proposals pointed to
the need to incorporate the
freshman into the system here
at the earliest possible time.
The report also maintained
that national selective frater-
nities be encouraged to par-
ticipate in the spirit of Pat-
terson Court.

The student self-study ad-
vised that laundry service be
made voluntary and that more
coin-operated machines be
made available.

The College Counseling Cen-
ter should’ be better
publicized; professional
psychological counseling be
expanded to a_ full-time
program; and vocational and
sex counseling should be
greatly increased in scope ac-
cording to the student report.

The open house system was
backed by the student resear-
chers. However, the student
standpoint was that students
reciprocate by holding their
own open houses.

In athletics, the top
priorities were additions to
present facilities. Improved or
expanded handbal! courts,
irack facilities (indoor), ten-
nis courts, and basketbal!
courts were listed as belig

especially important areas of
concern.

In the realm of union-
sponsored activities, students
clamored for more flexible
schedules and better
publicizing of events.

In the publications report,
student opinion recommended

a care evaluation of the’

“Quips and Cranks’ as its
present status is extremely
Shaky.

In student government,
there exists the need to
scrutinize the RMA for its
present worth and to explore
the Grievance Committee as
to its potentialities.

Students saw the Honor
Code as a viable system that
should be strictly enforced
and emphasized as the cor-
nerstone of the student com-
munity.

When someone spends
thirty years reminding people
to be careful with fire, and he
does it for no other reason
than to save our forests. he
makes a lot of friends.

The College Union will spon-
sor the second Davidson
College Carolina Crafts fair
next week. Exhibits and
workshops will be featured
during this week-long tribute
to the finer points of mountain
music and craft work.

The Union has invited moun-
tain craft artists from the
western North Carolina area
to come and exhibit their work
in ceramics, quilting, weaving
and metal work.

Monday and Tuesday of
next week, April 1 and 2, will
be devoted to the work of these
mountaineers. Their work will
be on display in Chambers
Foyer and in the Morrison
Room of the Union.

On Tuesday night at 8 p.m.
the mountaineers will perform
country music and tell stories
in the Rathskeller bar. Many
of these people are in their 70’s
and 80’s and their stories
promise to include mountain
lore centuries in age.

During the remainder of the
week, the displays in Cham-
bers and in the Morrison
Room will be those of studen-
ts. Friday will be an open day
in the Morrison Room. At this
time, any student who wishes
to show craft work of his own
may come and do so. There
will also be a swap shop at this
time where students and
guests can barter their goods.

Union Grove Fiddlers Con-
vention for the last two years.

Hall will perform in Cham-
bers Banquet Hall on Friday
night at 8p.m.

Saturday, April 6, will be the
final day of the fair. The af-
ternoon features a square dan-
ce on the soccer field. The
Davidson YMCA will provide
materials for students to build
and fly their own kites during
the dance.

The fair will conclude on
Saturday night with a per-
formance of the Mission
Mountain Woods Band in Love
Auditorium. The show will

begin at 8 p.m.

Former College Union
President Joe Earle ex-
pressed hopes that students
would participate in all of the
events of the fair.

He emphasized that studen-
ts should feel free to bring and
display their own craft work in
the Morrison room on Friday
afternoon .

“Any student who wants to
show his work should bring it.
If we have too many people,
we’ll have to rely on first come
first serve, but we don’t ex-
pect that tohappen,”’ he said.
