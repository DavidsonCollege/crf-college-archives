Connor’s
“Skin Cancer
Awareness”

Campaign Sizzles

Chambers —To raise aware-
ness among college students for
melanoma and other deadly forms
of skin cancer, Connor House has
decided to sponsor a “Lay Out
for Life” movement. Members of
Connor, since the beginning of —
March —and several times during

A pair of Connor girls speak with
a professor about the merits of
sunscreen, the hazards of ozone-
layer depletion and how hot the
new cashier at CVS is.

February— have spread towels,
blankets and quilts across Cham-
bers Lawn at a number of different
stations. These girls, clad only in
bikinis and sunglasses, naturally
attract an abundance of attention
from students heading to and from
class.

“Davidson College’s
male population has
recently jumped aboard
the skin
cancer-awareness train
with unbounded enthu-
siasm...”

Signs that say things like “Tf ]
Collect $300, I’m Allowed To Go
Back Into My Dorm And Avoid
The Sun’s Damaging Ultraviolet
Rays” and “Save Me From the Sun
— Donations Welcome!” are posted
next to the towels. The fundraisers’
indignant fellow females, bundled
in hoodies and jeans, simply scoff
and point to the nearest thermom-
eter, but Davidson College’s male
population has recently jumped
aboard the skin-cancer-awareness
train with unbounded enthusiasm.

“T think it’s great that these
girls are making this sacrifice,”
said Kappa sig junior Keith Lytle.
“It takes a lot of guts to expose
your skin to ultraviolet rays.” Lytle
said he personally donated $50
to one Connor girl’s cause — but
blushingly admits that he added
a generous tip in the hope that
“when she makes it inside, she
comes to my room.”

DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

Injured Mathlete Uses Golfcart

for Cross-Campus Transport .

Davidson— After an intense
three day math competition at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
Davidson student Brett Mitchell
’10 suffered a devastating injury.
Mitchell was innocently eating
a cheeseburger at a diner when a
fellow, jealous competitor shoved
him into a table. Mitchell felt
something hit his funny bone.

“_..the College has
recently taken a more
liberal approach in ap-
proving the use of golf
carts.”

“I was masticating my meal,
minding my own business and
then everything went black. I can’t
remember the next 72 hours. Iam
not sure if the bone is completely
shattered but our coach says it is
one of the worst injuries he has
seen on the circuit. It is by far the
most painful thing I have ever ex-
perienced” said Mitchell.

Mitchell has been called the
Stephen Curry of trigonometry. He
consistently dazzled the competi-
tion with his use of sine and cosine
until the injury. When he returned
to campus the funny bone injury
was so bad he could not even walk
from the library to the Union for
his 10:15 black bean quesadilla.
Fortunately, he was able to rent a
golf éart from the college.

While golf carts are usually
traditionally reserved for serious
injuries and longstanding medical
conditions, the College has recent-
ly taken a more liberal approach
in approving the use of golf carts.
Alex Madison ’09 had a horrific
hangover after a late night at the
Brickhouse last semester. One of
Madison’s friends got permission
for him to use a golf cart and Mad-
ison safely made it to Commons
the next moming. When Madison
had made a full recovery, he real-
ized that life in a golf cart was —
much more convenient than the
pedestrian life he had previously
experienced.

More effective than CPR?
Golf carts have been linked to doz-
ens of miraculous recoveries

One unlucky fellow, Brad Lith-
gow ’11, had the unfortunate com-
bination of getting a bad haircut
and a tooth ache in the same week!
The only remedy was a golf cart.
This writer hopes the trend of golf
cart use will continue for the rest
of the academic year.

“Octo-Mom” Confusion Revealed

An illustration of the
misinterpreted “Octo-Mom”

Birkdale—Jeff’s Comic Lair,
a well-established comic book
shop and licensed Dungeons and
Dragons retailer, was the site of a
controversy late Wednesday as the
“bubble of secrecy” broke around
Nadya Suleman, the mother and
sole parent of 14 young children.

“It’s unbelievable!” Hunters-
ville resident Jerome Clark ex-
claimed. “You mean she doesn’t
have special regenerative capabili-
ties or anything?”

Clark, a self-professed gamer
with a penchant for anime, is part
of a sizable minority of poorly-
informed Americans who misinter-
preted the tabloids’ coverage of the
“Octo-Mom.”

“Naturally we thought this was
something bizarre and spectacular.
When we learned that her only
claim to fame was pumping out
test tube babies, we were pretty
disappointed,” Clark explained.
“There’s no evidence for biohaz-
ardous waste affecting the Octo-
Mom, unless you count those col-
lagen injections in her lips.”

Clark and the other dweebs
were shocked to discover that
Nadya Suleman is little more than
an insecure woman with access to
modern medical equipment and
unscrupulous doctors.

“This explains a lot,” said Jeff
Duffel, owner of Jeff’s Comic
Lair. “For the longest time I con-
sidered saying something. She’s an
exact ripoff of Spiderman Vol. 64.”

AIG Executives
Complain About
Privacy Violations

Over $165 million has been
funnelled to AIG exectuives and
their cronies, but many social. cru-
saders and protesters are champi-
oning an unusual cause.

Michelle Shepard, a 24-year-
old waitress at a bagel/coffee
shop in Manhattan, is outraged.
“Just who do these federal and
state investigators think they are?
Those executives have every right
to swindle and extort the work-
ing American, and I’m not about

- to stand by idly while their own

rights are violated.”

Prying, intrusive queries about
how money has been spent has
made many of these exectuives
“uncomfortable.” They have been
singled out unfairly for such banal
purchases as a fourth golf-course
home, or collector’s items such as
George Lucas’ complete flannel
collection. Civil rights advocates
have universally condemnded the
trials, which are “just plain nosy.”
