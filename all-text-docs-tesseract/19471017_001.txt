Meza ‘Heads YMCA
Spiritual Program

By ARTHUR JENKINS

The spiritual devolpment depart-
ment of the Y.M.C.A. this year
is under. the very able leadership
of Herb Meza. Herb, for the past
two years, has participated a great
deal in religious activities on the
campus and in the community, The

success of this department is per-
haps the greatest aim of the
Y.M.C.A. It seeks to promote the

personal Christian living of the
students by presenting to them a
program of religious activities in
which they are encouraged to par-
ticipate.

The most- important aspect of
this program the hall prayer
meetings which are teld seach
Wednesday night at 10 o’clock:"The
members of each hall meet in the
room of one of the members and
are led in a brief devotional by 2
person selected by the hall prayer
leader. The procedure of these
meetings usually includes the sing-
ing of one or two hymns, scripture
reading, a brief message, and
prayers. This procedure can be
varied according to the leader's de-
sires. The hall prayer leaders are
encouraged to invite guest speakers
for the devotional who may be got-
ten from the student body, the
faculty, town ministers, and cabi-
net members. Each leader keeps
a «hart indicating the attendance
at ithese meetings.

Other phases of the program in-
clude ithe religious organizations on
the campus. The Westminster Fel-
lowship meets every Sunday eve-
ning immediately after supper at
Shearer Hall. These informal get-
togethers consist chiefly of hymn-
singing, prayers and messages, An-
other organization the David-
son Christian Fellowship. which
meets, Tuesday ‘nights at 7:15 in
the’ Guest House lounge. This
group emphasizes topical Bible
study. Sunday School for the stu-
dents is held at 10:15 every Sun-
day morning in Phi Hall. Students
are always cordially invited to at-
tend any of the local churches.
Everyone is encouraged to. support
these organizations because they
are on the campus for your bene-
fit. Sound Christian fellowship jis

ment of character in a student and

Miklos Gafni, sensational young
Hungarian tenor, Mr. Gafni made
his American debut last February
in New ‘York’s Town Hall, where
he was hailed “The new Caruso” by
leading ‘music critics and _ wildly
enthusiastic audiences.

The climb of Miklos Gafni to his
present position literally on top of
the musical world is as exciting
and modern as his astounding tenor
voice. Before his internment by the
Germans in 1943, Gafni had never
sung any classical music or had
any musical training. Three com-
rades in the labor camp, who later
died of starvation, taught him the
essentials of voice control-and after
being released from prison he de-
termined to pursue a career in the
musical world. Columbia Pictures
features Gafni in the story of his
life in “A Star Is Born.” His sen-
sational voice continues to receive
praise from all over the nation, as
this new star begins an unparalleled
career in the modern music world-

to all concerts this year on pre-
sentation of student activities books,
