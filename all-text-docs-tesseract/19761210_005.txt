The Hearing Committee
serves a vital role in the
preservation of the Honor
Code and therefore the David-
son way of life. I feel I could
best serve the college by being
a member of this committee,
and would be honored to do so.

Bev Jones
Junior

A Hearing Committee mem-
ber should be a responsible
student valuing the benefits of
a working Honor Code and
Code of Responsibility, and
concerned with providing an
objective, fair hearing for any
accused offender. I hope you
view me as such a student.

Dave Schmidt
Junior
In an election of this type,
one cannot make campaign
promises or pronouncements
that haven’t been made many
times in the past. I-can only
promise to devote the time and
effort necessary to do this job

properly.

Bill Sigmund

Junior, |
I feel that the Honor Sys-
tem/Code of Responsibilities
is the major component of
Davidson College not only
because it exists, but also
because it works. It is ob-
vious, though, that, in order
for it to’ work, it must be
enforced. If elected, I will do
my best to continue its en-
forcement and keep it an
integral part-of our college life.

The Student Hearing Com-
mittee serves as a court of
inquiry for cases in which a

ither the Honor System or
he rules of the college, in
rder to determine whether or
not the student is guilty of the
violation; and if so, what
sanctions should be applied.

All cases are referred to the
Hearing Committee by the
Dean's office when the case
cannot be solved by admini-
strative action. Most cases,
then, that reach the Hearing
Committee are of a relatively
serious nature. The Hearing
Committee does have the pow-
er to recommend that, if a
student is convicted of a
violation severe enough, the
student be dismissed from the
college.

The Hearing Committee is
composed of a pool of eighteen
students elected from the stu-
dent: body, divided by class in
the following manner: nine
rising juniors, six rising soph-
omores, and three rising fresh-
men.

A meeting of the Hearing
Committee comprises a panel
of six students chosen from
the larger pool. This arrange-
ment allows for a necessary

Davidson’s Honor System
is its most prized possession
and therefore it must be its
most guarded possession. I
would like to serve Davidson
in the capacity of protecting
this system through the Hear-
ing Committee.

I feel that the Honor Code
and Code of Responsibility are
integral and valuable parts of
a student’s rights and privi-
leges at Davidson. I am
running for the Hearing Com-
mittee to insure that these

amount of flexibility; for in-
stance, in the case where a
retrial is necessary and a panel
of different students must
consider the case.

Particulars about the func-
tion of the Hearing Committee
can be found in the Davidson
College Code of Responsibility
and Code of Disciplinary Pro-
cedure [1971]: 1976-77. Copies
may be obtained in the Dean’s
office.

Several essential points,
however, about the function of
the Hearing Committee should
be apparent to students in
their consideration of the can-
didates running for the Hear-
ing Committee positions.

The Hearing Committee
meets no more than an aver-
age of two or three times a
year to consider a case. Thus,
it is not the quantity of its
activity which justifies its
function; rather, it is the
quality of its judgment and
careful consideration on the
part of its members in relation
to each case which justifies its
existence as a part of student
self-government.

Since the Hearing Commit-
tee considers cases involving
not only violations of the
Honor System but of college Y
rules as well, a candidate forZ

rights are insured and are

Debbie Jo Bumgarner
Sophomore —

The Honor System is a vital
part of Davidson life, and it is
every student’s responsibility
to follow the regulations that
accompany the system in or-
der to make it work. The
Student Hearing Committee
hasan important function in
that it helps to enforce the
rules set by the Honor Code.
As a member of the Hearing
Committee I would do my
utmost to uphold these rules
and regulations and to make
the right decisions necessary
for the maintenance of the
Honor System.

Charlie Cochran
Sophomore

I feel that the Honor Code is
a tremendous asset which we
benefit from every day and yet
I realize that it does not
always work perfectly. How
ever, we have each committed
ourselves to this ideal and |
want to serve on the Hearing
Committee to help insure that
the Honor Code continues to

be thoroughly familiar with
the regulations of the colle
as well as the structure of the
Honor System. Any candi-
date, therefore, must be wil-
ling to spend the necessary
time to familiarize oneself with
the internal structure of Dav-
idson’s laws and morals as
embodied in its regulations
and its Honor System. This
structure, however, depends
on a process of fair implemen-
tation by those responsible,
students, faculty, staff, and
administration alike.

The Hearing Committee
functions not only as a studen
court. Members visit wit
freshman halts at the begin-
ning of the academic year to
present and discuss the Honor
System. The Chairman of the
Hearing Committee also wri-
tes a letter to all students at
exam times reminding them o
the privileges and require-
ments of the Honor Svstem

John Harrison
Sophomore

My interest in the Student
Hearing Committee reflects
my concern for our recognition
of the Code of Responsibility.
The respect that students
have for this code is strong; I
am interested in offering my
services to a committee dedi-
cated to the perpetuation of
this high level of responsibility
aong students.

Mary Hay
Sophomore
The Honor System is one of
the finest institutions of Dav-
idson. As a Tepresentative of
the students, I can help pre-
serve this system.

David Herrington
Sophomore
I feel like the Honor System

is a very important and re-
freshing outlook here at Dav-

the Hearing Committee in
order to have some positive
influence in preserving an
Honor System that really
works.

Steven G. Hull
Sophomore

The Hearing Committee is
charged with making import-
ant decisions which affect
students at Davidson. The
necessary qualifications for
this position are the capacity
for fair and judicious decisions
in any case which is heard, an
understanding of the better
and intent of the Code of Re-
sponsibility and Code of Dis-
ciplinary Procedure, and the
ability to decide on proper
action after weighing the facts
and the extenuating circum-
stances of a case. I feel that I
understand the responsibili-
ties of this committee and will
be able to function as an
effective member.

David Hoffmann
Sophomore

As more and more colleges
drop their honor systems,
Davidson’s is fast becoming
unique. The Honor System is
one of the reasons I chose
Davidson, and I would like the
opportunity to actively assist
this important feature of Dav-
idson.

Bruce Lantelme
Sophomore
The Honor System is a vital
aspect of our academic and

social education. Self-sched-
uled exams, pledged papers,
lack of test supervisors, and
unlocked doors all point to the
healthiness of our Honor
Code. Students must exhibit a
high level of maturity and
trustworthiness, but in return
it means tremendous respect
from faculty, administration,
and others of the academic
world. I have a deep respect
for the Honor Code and I
would like much to
become an integral part of it.
