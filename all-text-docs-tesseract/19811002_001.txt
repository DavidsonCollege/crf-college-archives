fice.

~ Junior Natalie Kerr arrived at Grey
House this:summer to try to get things
ready for the fall. She ‘said the scene that
greeted ‘her wre almost «| ;
There was jurik, in the bedrooms and
trash on the floor. There was food in the
cabinets and in the refrigerator that had
been therefor months. The bathroom
was so-dirty and so full’ of mildew that.
Natalie: was, scared. to even. walk in the
room. She felt compelled to run tothe
‘store, buy some cleaner, and. ‘scrub
down the bathroom and bedroom before
she would bring her. things into the
house. As‘a little added plus to an.al-
ready filthy scene, fleas had moved into
the shag carpet. ;

‘Natalie said that the ultimate mo-
ment came-when “we made the —

. » The place looked as though no one
had cleaned it all summer. From the up-
stairs carpet to the kitchen appliances, it

- was, as Natalie said, basically “gross.”

But oné wouldn’t know it to see__

the: other Grey House residents had:the
curtains and chair covers cleaned and
stripped the olds wax ‘off the. kitchen
floor. The girls said they had to stand on °

desk until ..omeone: from: thé College
