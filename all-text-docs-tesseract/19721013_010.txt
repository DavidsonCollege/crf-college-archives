THE LEADER OF THE PACK
Two Davidson harriers move to edge out runners

from The Citadel.

Ricky Bell: ‘Best In

By MARK CONNORS
Staff Writer

The Davidson track and
cross-country teams are very
fortunate to have sophomore
Ricky Bell, probably the best
distance runner to come to
Davidson in a long time, ac-
cording Track and Cross Coun-
try Coach Sterling Martin.

Bell came to Davidson with a
long list of achievements.During
his high school years at Wooa-
berry-Forest School, he
dominated the distance events
from the 880 to the two mile and
was also Woodberry’s premier

Tennis Team

Selected

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Staff Writer

With many returnees from
last year’s squad, the tennis
team at Davidson College
should prove to be even better
than last vear.

“We will definitely be
stronger than last year,” com-
mented coach Harry Fogleman.
‘We have some good additions,
plus some good returning let-
termen.”

Leading the corps of ex-
perienced players is David
Weaver. who won the Southern
Conference singles cham-
pionship the previous season.

Bill Allen comes back after
finishing second in the number
two singles.

Gary Bressler who holds the
number five singles title is also

returning.
Fogleman is high on Hi
Lankenau, who is back from

abroad. He is termed a “fine
doubles player.”

Kevin Menton and Maarten
Ruys are two foreign netters
that impress Fogleman.

“We have a lot of work to do
on the doubles. said
Fogleman. “We were weak
there last year.”

One doubles combination will
probably be Weaver and Ruys.
while Allen and Mento should
pair off as another.

The rest of the squad includes
Rich Quimbly. Bill DuPont and
John Mitchell. One other spot
has yet to be determined.

cross-country man.

His senior year, Bell won the
Virginia private school mile
championship with an im-
pressive 4:24.

Bell's reason for coming to
Davidson was that he was ‘‘im-
pressed by the people con-
cerned with Davidson, most
especially Coach Martin."

This admiration for the Cat's
cross-country and track coach
has made Bell probably the
most dedicated runner at
Davidson, according to his
teammate.

He has already asserted him-
self as Davidson's premier
miler and cross-country runner.

Along with what Martin con-
siders a fine 4:23.9 mile last
year. Bell was elected most
valuable player for the cross-
country.

Although he was “extremely
happy about the award, Bell
has encountered some added
pressure as a result of this early
merit.

2 Fall To Citadel, Wake Forest

By MARK CONNORS
Staff Writer

After an encouraging win
against Richmond, the cross-
country team faltered with
losses to the The Citadel and
Wake Forest, however, the
harriers hope to reverse this
trend when they meet Campbell
and St. Andrews this Saturday.

The Davidson Cross-country
team defeated Richmond on
Oct. 2 after their initial loss to
Furman.

Team front runner Rick Bell
said, ‘‘It was the best team ef-
fort since I've been here."’

Coach Sterling Martin was
very encouraged by the out-
come and said, “it was our first
Southern Conference win in a
long time and it showed me that
we're stronger down the line.”’

The Davidson runners placed
five men in low. scoring
positions to defeat the Spiders

10 Years’

After only one year of ex-
perience, he is considered by
his teamates as the team leader
along with Captain Ron Clark.
To cope with pressure from
both track and school, Bell said
that he has had to develop a
“sense of priorities’.

“Davidson is probably much
more enjoyable than schools
that rely on scholarships for
their track program,” Bell said.
“If we can keep more up-
perclassmen on the team, it
would make for a_ stronger,
more mature program, "he said.

‘In three or four years,
people will be talking about-
Davidson wkere they weren't
before.”’ he said.

Although Bell is somewhat
reserved about his running
ability, his teamates are more
open about his talent.

Captain Ron Clark called Bell
a “strong competitor” and is in
full agreement with Martin's
statement that “Ricky is the
best distance runner to come to
Davidson in 10 years.”

ped meets to The Citadel and
Wake Forest. The Citadel
defeated Davidson 16-39 in
Davidson's first run on their
home course.

Martin said, ‘‘The Citadel ran
well as a team and had three
men that were particularly
strong.”

Davidson dropped another to
Wake Forest last Monday.

According to captain Ron
Clark, ‘“‘Wake surprised us. It
was the first time they ran as a

team. It was also the best team
Wake has had in two vears.”

Although Davidson lost by 23

points, Coach Martin was very

encouraged.

As far as our training is
coming, it was the best run
we've made. I was particularly
impressed by the freshmen,”’
he said.

Martin was pleased with the
performances of Steve Scroggs,
Bill Cole, Chuck Sudetic and
Jesse Smith.

The team was also pleased
with their performances. ‘‘We
had five guys under thirty
minutes,’" commented Ricky
Bell.

This Saturday, Davidson will
travel to St. Andrews where
they will run a tri-meet with St.
Andrews and Campbell.

Martin felt the two teams
probably would not be too
strong at this point and added,
“If their teams are anything
like in the past, we should come
home with a couple of medals.”

Besides the tri-meet this
weekend, Martin and the cross

country team are looking for-
ward to Monday's meet with
VMI and W&L.

VMI seems to be on a level
with Davidson at this time,
Martin said. They recently
defeated Richmond by a score
very similar to the Davidson-
Richmond score.

The tri-meet will be held Mon-
day at Davidson at 4 p.m.

backfield man for Davidson.

Quarterback Scotty Shipp will
be called upon to direct the at-
tack. His passing effort Satur-
day was a tremendous ad-
vantage to the Wildcats.

The visitors will most likely
have to cope with a dual-
powered machine harboring a
great degree of potential that
the Davidson supporters are
hoping will be unleashed.

“We only want the boys to
give their all like they did
against Appalachian,” Fagg
suggested. ‘‘In that sense this
game is no more important than
any other game. We just want to
be the best. We think we can.”

A win would end a long
drought for the Cats at home. It
would also stop the Paladins’
victory streak over Davidson.

In 1970, Davidson dropped a
close 31-28 decision, but last
year Furman swamped the
Cats, 41-6.

A victory will also run David-
son's Southern Conference
record to 2-0-1, placing them
higher in the standings.
