Davidson And
Democracy Is
Orators Text

With “Davidson and Democracy”
as his subject, Hon. O. Max Gard-
ner, former governor of North-Gar-
olina, addressed a Homecoming
gathering —in--Chambers~ auditorium
on” Saturday, November 2.

Throughout the .speech Gardner
paid high tribute to Davidson and
some of the individuals connected
with the college. Referring to sports
as a_one-time- opponent playing
with Carolina, he stated, “I never
saw a Davidson man who did not
play the game clean. Ben Lacy is
the toughest Christian man I ever
saw,”

In speaking of education in gen-
eral, Mr. Gardner stated that edu-
cation is not the acquisition of
knowledge, but the development of
character. “You must teach a man
to. be_master of his environment.
That is the science of education.”

The speaker brought out that al-
though our government.is ruled
by the majority, it cannot take
away the rights of the minority
under our system. He went on,

_ “No citizen shall be deprived of
lifef-liberty or property except by
the impartial judgment of 12 men.
The conscience of these 12 men is
one of the foundations of our de-
mocracy.”

Gardner. was introduced by Har-
lee Branch, president of the Alumni
Association.

“Post-Boxosis” Malady
Restrains Freshmen

By HENRY McINTOSH

From time to time members of
the lowly class of ‘44 experience
that malady which “Doc” Matthews
would probably diagnose as “post-
boxosis.”. The symptoms of this
strange disease, which is peculiar
to the freshman class alone,
desire on the part of the affected
frosh to be on such a_ heinous
“drive” that he finds no time to
visit the P. O. to receive a personal
message from Adolf Hitler’s David-
son embassy, the Court of Control.

But possessors of scarlet head-
gear need not expect this embassy
to be closed should Hitler’s regime
fallin the near future. For being
founded when it was, the Court of
Control has become as much a part
of the tradition of Dayidson as has
its sister project, the construction.
of the New Chambers Building.

It was-in- the same-year. that the

Davidson student body sang “O,

wreckage of the old Chambers
Building that this freshman con- |
