A Dubious Option

The pass-fail option has been a welcome addition to
the Davidson curriculum in the years since it was institu-
ted, but several questions can and should be raised over
its administration.

The first is the diversity of faculty reaction to a stu-
dent taking a course pass-fail. Although some welcome such
students, others seem to take it as an affront and as an
indication that the student intends to do as little work as
possible.

In the case of such negative responses, it does not seem
that the student is doing himself a favor when he is requir-
ed to get the faculty member’s signature on the pass-fail
form for the registrar.

The option of taking a course pass-fail should rest with
the student and his advisor. If in consultation with his ad-
visor, a student wishes to take a course on that basis, his
signature and that of his advisor should be all that is re-
quired.

The grades can be turned in to the registrar as nor-
mal and the registrar’s office can make the appropirate
translation of the grade as P or F. In this manner the in-
structor’s evaluation of the student taking a pass fail course
suffers from neither a positive or negative influence that
that knowledge may have on his grading.

The Little Things

Its easy to isolate the major complaints and advantages
of a school like Davidson. But its the little things which
make the day to day life bearable or miserable. Most of
them, they could make a major impact on the visceral life.

At the risk of reminding you of your high school news-
paper, we have taken the liberty to isolate a few of the
“little things.”

Finding the gym locked on a weekday night or a week
end afternoon. Finding that the juke box has been put on
free play. Putting money into one of the myriad of machines
and getting nothing back out.

Showing your ID to get into a basketball game. Read-
ing THE DAVIDSONIAN (we hope that this one is at least
ambiguous). Finding that your courses are all full without

ou.

y Rain. Finding five letters in your mailbox. Finding
the book store closed everytime you go by, after 9 or
Saturday afternoon. Color TV sets which don’t work. Ugly
art in the lounges. Classes which run long. Paying two
dollars for a parking sticker and not finding a place to
ark it.

should give us an in).

The Crosswhite Saga

While on the subject of thoughts that make us smile,
we would be negligent if we did not comment on the re-
cent appearance at Davidson of one of the college’s most
colorful products.

The return of the near-legendary Rocky Crosswhite
to the Davidson campus, the scene of his many literary
successes and athletic frustrations as spokesman for the
basketball team bench, sparks fond memories of a time
when men were men and skins were skins.

Most students and many of the faculty and adminis-
tration never had the opportunity to watch a typical Cross-
white move (on or off the court) or to read his very witty
and revealing column, From the Bench, on the Driesell
basketball teams.

We remember Rocky’s column. mentioned even in
Sports Illustrated, and the breathless anticipation in which
students waited for each issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN to
“read Rocky.” We remember his yearly all-conference
selections, when he would pick the season’s best “skin”
team from the likes of VMI, The Citadel, and Richmond.

We remember Crosswhite’s tales of Lefty, the success-
ful and controversial basketball coach of an era past, and
the chagrin the column often caused the great foot
stomper. We remember Rocky’s choices for the campus
“Who's Nothing,” including a newspaper editor, and his
end-of-the-year state-of-the-college reflections, not all of
which got‘into print.

. Finally, we remember Rocky, beyond his sacreligious
literary and athletic feats, as a warm and sensitive person,
a man with real insight into what can give the Davidson
community a gutload of laughter, and with the ability to
stimulate such laughter.

Now that Crosswhite has gone “down under” to the
greener pastures of Australian basketball, we again wish

him the best, and hope that his days are full of shirts, and
never’ skins.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Transylvania Starters Set;

Prospects Dim For Team

To The Editor:

With basketball polls hitting
the Hub newstands, it seems ap-
propriate at this time to ex-
plore the possibilities of the
team this year at good ol’ TU
(Transylvania University).

Recruiting has gone well, the
promises of blooderade for time-
outs, padded coffins, and coeds
with extra long necks having
pulled in quite an impressive
squad.

Here, then, is a look at Dr.
Frankenstein’s team: At center
of course, will be Dr. Franken-
stein’s monster. At 7-1, 300
pounds, he possesses adequate
size although he is somewhat
slow and foul-prone, especially
when angered by a call by the
referees or by torches held aloft
by the fans. He has a good
shooting touch due to the fact
that one of his arms once be-
longed to a star NBA player
(R.LP.).

One wingman, for sure. will
be Count Dracula. His unusual
soaring ability makes him a
great rebounder as well as
scorer. He also is a good de-
fensive player. owning one of
the most captivating defensive
stares in the game. He pre-
sents, however, serious prob-
lems for scheduling, as he can
only play night games. He also
refuses to play Catholic teams
whose players cross themselves
at the foul line.

BOBBY ALLEN

The other wingman is the
Fly. He is an excellent fast
break man and is quite pesky
on defense.

At guard, the Mummy holds
down one position. He is a tre-
mendous defensive player, ap-
pearing quite slow but always
catching his man. His age and
experience is very useful to a
relatively young team (average
age 368) but plays with injuries
to 90% of his body, so it ap-
pears.

The other starting guard will
be the Invisible Man. Big |, as
he is known by the fans, is a
dazzling player who delights in
steals, come-from-nowhere picks,
and somewhat unsubtle elbows.
Nevertheless, he has never been
called for a foul. Height and
weight are unknown. ,

In addition to this dazzling
starting lineup, there is an am-
ple corp of reserves. Best depth
is at center where 6-6 250 pound
The Thing comes in to spell
Frank. Plagued with immobili-
ty and bad hands, the Thing
makes up for these difficulties
by killing troublesome referees.

Also providing reserve
strength in the pivot is King
Kong. At approximately 47’ (no
one has persuaded him to stand
still long enough for measure-
ment) he has the height neces-
sary to become a great college
player. Unfortunately, he is only
available for action at home

games as travelling with him
presents problems. He also
lacks finesse .

Other important reserves who
will see action this year in-
clude aggressive Jack the Rip-
per, whose quick, slashing of-
fensive style leaves the oppon-
ents breathless and the crowd
in stitches. The Triffid, while
quite slow, has the long arms
(and the many arms) neces-
sary to be a great rebounder.
The Blob, while not much of
scorer, covers the court well on
defense and sets one hell of a
pick.

One of the saddest stories on
the team concerns the brilliant
and talented Wolfman. Wolf, a
savage baliplayer whose quick-
ness and aggressiveness could
have earned him an all-league
berth, was thrown off the team
because he was avaliable for
action only once a month and
because his shaggy long hair
offended some of the influential
alumni.

All in all, the prospects ap-
pear dim, which is to say,
things are good. If they can
avoid gyms: with mirrors on
the walls, and referees with
silver whistles, they might just
kill everyone they play.

Good Things Said About D.C.

There are always a lot of bad
things to write about Davidson.
Not that Davidson is such a
terrible place. (I even get to
like it sometimes) but the long-
er you Stay around a place, the
more it rubs against you.

Todd vents his anger by beat-
ing dead fraternities: Cecil

Fraternity Votes
Coeducation Fund

At the last meeting of Phi
Eta Sigma, an underclass schol-
astic fraternity, the following
rcsolution was introduced and
approved.

Whereas Coeducation is a
pressing need at Davidson Col-
lege:

Whereas no significant action
is being taken by Davidson Col-
lege to implement coeducation:

Whereas the administration
claims that lack of funds stands
in the way of such implementa-
tion of coeducation;

Be it therefore resolved: That
Phi Eta Sigma donated a con-
ditional gift of. $100 to be
matched by Davidson College,
earmarked for the sole purpose
of planning for the immediate
implementation of a significant
degree of coeducation at David-
son College.

The gift must be matched and
used by April 30, 1972 for co-
education for academic year
1972-73 or the donation will be
withdrawn.

likes to see how close he can
come to slander—its just a mat-
ter of how you like your hosti-
lity served.

But since it's almost time for
glad tidings and great joy and
all, I think its only proper to
Say some good things about good
ole D. C. The best way I know
of to make D. C. look good is
by relating the ‘You think you
have got it bad” story to end
all.

At a gathering of college
newspaper editors last spring,
I happened to strike up a con-
versation with a guy and a girl
from a small college in Georgia
who were receiving an award
for their school paper.

After hearing about their
school I felt they should have
received the M. Ghandi Per-
severance Medal. If you think
we've got it bad. ...

At X Collge (all of this they
told me, I swear) shotgun-car-
rying security police patrol the
barbed-wire enclosed campus
with loaded guns and frequently
get drunk on the job.

There are sirens on the dorm
doors after 11:00..

Girls aren’l allowed outside
the dorm with curlers in their
hair.

There are bad checks.

Sixty students were suspend-
ed last year for letting their
hair grow too long.

While interviewing students
last spring, the newspaper ed-
itors discovered that one stu-
dent thought Cambodia was the

name of a fraternity on campus.

Kids can be kicked out of
school for public display of
affectation.

There was a recent move to
eliminate English as a major
course of study.

The student body is pro-fra-
ternity, pro-sorority, anti-seme-
tic and anti-Catholic.

The average professor can
“put speed freaks to sleep.”

The hot books on campus are.
Listen to the Warm and Love
Story.

But as the editors told me
(both of whom were transfer-
ring out) ‘it really is a neat
place — where else are things
so bad that you can hate every-
thing.”

Merry Christmas D. C.

Trustee Action -:;

Raises Questions

To The Editor:

The action or inaction by the
trustees retaining the Christian
requirement for faculty tenure
raises serious questions about.
the outlook for Davidson’s brand
of “liberal” education. The East-
ern Studies program must be
built around guest speakers. Do
faculty and students think they:
have no influence on the trus-
tees or are they unconvinced
that the situation merits con
cern? ;
