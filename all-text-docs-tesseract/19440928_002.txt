To The Freshmen .. .

Becoming a freshman in ‘college is an
important event in the life of any young
man. Becoming a freshman at Davidson
makes that event even more important!
On behalf of the old students of David-
son, we wish to extend a hearty welcome
to all new men, and to make a few sug-
gestions and cautions which we hope will
be helpful in your life here.

Since coming to Davidson you have
surely heard that it is a school of tradi-
tions. Learn those traditions and ob-
serve them in your life here. If you don’t
know them, get your Wildcat Handbook
and read up! Davidson spirit will be ob-
served in the upper classes, and the older
students will expect you to carry on, and
to maintain the high standards of which
we are all proud.

A recent Honor graduate of Davidson
was heard to say: “I could have had a
much higher average had it not been for
my freshman grades.”” That is a’ word
of warning which all new men should
heed. Remember that your graduation
will be one of the major events of your
life, and start building toward it now.
-Enter into the social life of Davidson,
but remember that your diploma will be
awarded you only on one basis—scholar-
ship.

Mentioned in the opening paragraph is
the fact that a man is fortunate to be a
freshman at Davidson. One has only to

look at the position in which students of
other larger colleges find themselves to
see how Davidson is far superior. Our
enrollment is large and our faculty com-

paratively intact. Our fraternities are
functioning, as are the majority of the
extra-curricular activities. Every fresh-
man should be aware of his privilege in
being here, and the subsequent responsi-
bility to do his part in keeping Davidson
high on the list.

Davidson is noted as a Christian col-
lege, and its students are proud of that
fact.
body, will be expected to live as a Christ-
ian gentleman at all times. Whether you
think you are succeeding or not is im-
portant, but not as important as you at
least try. By making a try you will be a
much happier person, and you will win the
respect of those around you.

Finally, remember that you are a fresh-
man. As such, you will have certain
duties and rules which you will be ex-

pected to follow. Those who have gone

before .you have been through those
things, too, and everything you are re-
quired to do has a purpose behind it. Enter
into the spirit of the thing, and get to be
a Davidson man!

Here’s to a great year, the first of your
four at Davidson!

Congratulations...

We quote from the Davidsonian of July
28, 1944: “There is no longer a Student
Store at Davidson. The establishment in
the basement of the gym which has taken
over the stock and the name of the Stu-
dent Store is neither managed nor clerked
by students, nor is it even operated with
the students’ interests primarily in mind.”

It was a joy to the student body to re-
turn this fall and find the Stud re-estab-
lished on almost the same basis ‘as former
days, Though it is not-in its old location,
it is in just as good a place, perhaps better.

The enlarged space afforted the Stud is
a definite improvement in some respects.
The question of heating so large a room
is dubious, however.

It is encouraging to see the Store back: -

at thé doorsteps of the dorms. To be able
to grab a “coke” or a smoke without walk-
ing halfway to Cornelius is a pleasure, to
say the least..

Hours at the Stud have also been
changed to meet the. students’ demands,
and the only suggested improvement is
that a clerk might be on hand at midnight
Sunday.

Genial Pete Whittle is still in charge,
and he now has a.staff of student clerks
who make the place look like pre-way
days. The boys are there to see that the
Student Store belongs to the students,
and this was another badly needed change.

A very nécessary thought is that the
blame for thé Stud’s position this summer
lay largely upon the students themselves.
Now that it is again running on the old

basis, it is up.to the students to keep it °

that way.

The students should be grateful for the
co-operation of the administration in
making the Stud a more convenient and
more congenial place to gather.

You, as a member of its student.

Around

Like most Davidsonian feature
columns, this one was born in the
wee hours of the morning only a
few hours from a dead line and a
dead editor. With wits and pencils
as sharp as they are at that time
of night, the substance of this fea-
ture had to be borrowed. Assum-
ing that stuff written for The
Davidsonian becomes its property,
Bill Lyman's old column entitled
Slyme was the source of the drama
which follows. With rushing now
behind us, we take’ you back behind
the scenes and expose the squalid
truth of those sleepless and pledge-
less days of rush week.

ACT I

Scene: The chapter room of the
Alpha Sigma Sigma House. About
thirty students, with collars unbut-
toned, shoes off, are draped at_var-
ious places about the room. These
men look as though they had just
been through Custer’s Last Stand,
all groaning quietly.

Time: about 10:15 in the evening,
after official rushing has ended for
the day.

(There is no action seen nor aud-
ible comment heard for ten minutes. )
(Enter the chapter president.)

This Might
Be You

Now that all the Freshmen, are “on
the drive” one may observe many,
many examples of strong willpower
and keen concentration. We see the
ambitious young men _ start off
bright and fresh at 8:30 p.m.”

“Now, let’s see. Where’s that pen-
cil? Ah, here it is. Now here comes
that Yankee. Wonder what he
wants?”

“Geeze kid, I just heard a new
joke. Wait’ll ya hear it. Ya see there
wuz this guy in the phone booth,
see? And he got stabbed, see? Now
ya get it? He got stuck in the mid-
dle of his conversation. ha, ha, ha.”

“Really a harmless creature, you
just leave him alone and he wanders
away. Well, back to work. Alpha,
Beta and unh, unh. Hey shut up!
How can a guy study? We've got to
get some work done around here.”

“Oh, hi Joe, come on in, Read
any of this stuff? No thanks, I
quit. Training, you know. Well—
maybe one.wouldn’t ‘hurt anything.
What's her name? Yeh, she’s nice.
Going to Charlotte Saturday? Sce
if you can get me a date, will you?
See you in the morning, Joe.”

“I won't read any more of this.
Maybe he won’ go this far tomor-
row. What? No, you ‘can't borrow
the alarm clock. You forgot to wake
me up in time for my second period
class. I don’t care if you miss break-
fast. Giv eit back, you lousy *x$&*$

Ah Huh Twelve o'clock.
Gosh, where'll I hide my hat, under
the rug maybe. Who'd ever find it
there? Oh, it’s too late to study
any more; think I'll go to bed.”

And so ends another night of the
freshman on the long road to. edu-
cation.

Stooge: On land, da da da da, da
da; in the air...

Prexy: (Interrupting) We're get-
ting nowhere fast.

We'll go on to the
Sneezy Jones.

4th Stud: Wel-I-l, -he’s a pretty
good boy, but I don’t think he’s Al-
pha Sig material.

Stooge: I make a motion’ that the
rushing chairman ball every other
man on the list and that we
journ.

Prexy: All in favor say

All: Aye. ;

Prexy: All bpposed say “No.”

All: No.

Prexy: We stand adjourned until

Curtain
ACT TWO
Time: Same night, just after the
meeting.

Scene. a campus pathway leading

to the dormintories,

It is a dark, dark, dark night, and
ominous trees are seen looming up
in the background. Everything is
sort of Stygian. Two students are
seen stumbling along the path.

Ist Stud: (Cursing quietly).

2nd: Stud: (Cursing quietly).

Curtain
ACT THREE

Time: Same day, a little later.

Scene: A dormitory room. .One
of the Alpha Sig’s is dramatically
holding a glass of poison in_ his
hand _— evidently in profound
thought. There is a look of deep
deep misery on: his face.

Alpha Sig: Rush week is really
more than I can stand.

(He gulps poison and crumples in
a heap on the floor. Very dramatic.)
