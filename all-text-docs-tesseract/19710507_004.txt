Expanding Exchange

If Governor Scott made a valuable point in his
address Monday, it was his comment that Davidson
has not fulfilled its potential. (It is interesting that
Scott offered glittering hope but no promise of state
funds.)

One of the educational innovations to which the

overnor alluded can well be the exchange program
tween Queens and Davidson, if the proposal does
indeed get off the ground.

Although a little more local in flavor than the
Hight College Exchange Program, the Queens exchange
affords the same educational opportunities. We hope
that the Eight College Exchange and the Queens ex-
change program are just the beginning of a greater
range of exchange programs for students at Davidson.

As an educational opportunity the idea of the
transient or exchange student has a great deal of ap-
peal. To have transient student program institution-
alized as an exchange program, however loosely or
tightly structured, makes it more accessible to stu-
dents and easier to administrate.

We would hope that Dr. Ostwalt and the faculty
will seek to expand the exchange program to include
Johnson C. Smith and Belmont Abbey in the area
and eventually push for a federation similiar to the
scholarship group to which the school belongs. Such
a federation would enable Davidson ‘students to ex-
change with a broad range of different colleges.

Town And Gown

~ One of the most oft-heard of student complaints
at Davidson is the cry that there is no opportunity in
this secluded and comfortable little community to
work for constructive change. Students feel that
there is nothing of significance happening here to
warrant their energies or attentions.

Such understanding of the town of Davidson is,
however, far from the ‘truth, for this hamlet is no
idyllic situation. There are still racial tensions and
supicions in the ‘other Davidson,” there is poverty
here, there is a class culture, there are all those pro-
blems one encounters whenever he observes any
community of human beings.

If this seems hard to believe, then take an after-
noon off one day and walk through the mill com-
munity and the black community, talk with the re-
sidents and observe the frustration of living within
the shadow of a less-than-benevolent college com-
munity.

Then perhaps it will became obvious why the
town activities next week are so significant to the
students as well as to the town residents themselves.
For these activities offer to all elements of David-
son life the.chance to get together to work for a
better Davidson community.

The students, faculty and administrators of the
college community will be presented with the chal-
lege of rolling up their sleeves and becoming involv-
ed with the blacks, the mill workers, and the Main
Street merchants of Davidson. And perhaps more
importantly, the college will have the opportunity to
begin to repair some of the strained town-gown re-
lationships. .

Because of this, we commend these activities to
anyone who is interested not only in Davidson but
also in the people here. It’s been said before, but it
still rings true: rhetoric is only as good as the action
that follows.

Sign Of Encouragement

The decision of the faculty to continue discus-
sion on the issue of opening their meetings is a sign
of hope ‘for students.

__ We hope that the faculty will put off a final de-

cision on the open meeting proposal as it is reported
out of committee until the fall when they may have
discussion with the students who will be directly af-
fected by the vote.
In assessing the faculty’s decision it is encourag-
ing that they selected the options they did for the Fac-
ulty Executive Committee study. The proposal is the
most favored by the students and provides for the
fullest student participation in. faculty meetings.

. The faculty is to be supported for their willing-
ness to allow students to have a voice in the meetings
which play such a key role in the academic life of
the college.

College Only Cleans Up

Campus For Ceremonies

In a brochure prepared for
Alumni Day this Spring,
there is written the follow-
ing statement:

“Alumni Weekend is the
particular time of year when
Davidson dusts the cornices,
cuts the grass and generally
spruces up for her ‘sons’.”’

It fascinates me ‘to see so
much effort to clean David

Several times each year,
when the college administra-
tion gets ready to have one
of its big events, we see
sudden bursts of activity
around the campus. ,

We see the entire contin-
gent of Davidson's grounds

scene early in the morning,
cutting the grass, trimming

the hedges, clearing away son up for these special
debris, and polishing up the

Brewster And McGovern
Provide Insight On War

To The Editor: bodies."’
As one who has for a long These are profound words
time been deeply concerned of a dedicated, moral man.

about the immorality of the
war which successive Wash-
ington administrations have
imposed upon the  Indo-
chinese people, I am greatly
encouraged by tthe position
taken by Yale University's
President, Dr. | Kingman
Brewster, Jr.

Naturally, his audience was
deeply moved, for he touch-
ed a chord that denotes the
very essence of what every
true American patriot wants
his country to be.

Another voice, this time
that of’ a statesman as well
as an intellectual and moral
man. U.S, Senator
McGoverm, lin a television
program on the day before
Washington's birthda y
stated:

“TI regard this war as the
most barbaric and inhumane
act that our country has ever
committed. I think it terri-
ble that this country has its
bombers ranging all across
the face of Indochina, killing
innocent men, women, and
children by the tens of
thousands, paying the people
of Vietnam: and Laos and
Cambodia to kill each other
and doing all of this in the
name of self-determination
for them.

The voices of Dr. Brewster
and Senator McGovern are
the true American voices.
Let's accept their advice and
begin now to rehabilitate
America physically, intellect-
ually, and spiritually.

Hugh B. Hester
Brigadier General

Ina talk on Alumni Day,
February 20, 1971, in Yale’s
Freshmen Commons, the
President stated:

“To my mind the basic
flaw in our Southeast Asian
war policy is moral. The
policy seems to be shaped
and is most often discussed
as though America had no
concern for the sanctity of
human life as such, as though
we cared only about Amer-
ican lives.

“The reduction of Amer-
ican casualities, even the
withdrawal of all American
combat troops, does not
mitigate our moral responsi-
bility: for the spread of the
war; for the indiscriminate
bombing of neutrals; for -the
scorching of forests and
villages; for the massacre
of innocents. EN

“The issue, to me, is not
tactical or strategic. It is
the moral callousness of the
assumption that the body
count doesn't matter as long ¥
as, they are not American

George

scheduled by the Office of
Alumni Affairs for Alumni
Weekend are not ‘‘doctored-
up’’ in order to keep alumni
misinformed so they will
continue to give more mioney.
And, further, I wonder if it
is not true during the rest
of the year that the admni-
istration sometimes does not
tell students the whole story

behind the decisions it
makes.

If Dr. Spencer and Mr.
Cornell had been completely
honest, for example, they
would have admitted that

the reason that we see a 235
dollar tuition increase next
year is not just because of
rising cost in other parts of.
the country. They would have
admitted that they are set-
ting up an. administrative
kingdom on the first floor
of Chambers at a cost of
thousands of dollars. Next
year, incidentally, the phil
osophy department members
will be moved out and their
offices will be used for ad-
ministrative offices.

And they would have also
admitted that at least 80
dollars of that increase will
go to pay for the “money |
which they did not raise this

‘year for the football team.

I contend that we, as stu-
dents, do not always hear
the truth about administra-
tive decisions because many
administrators feel it is im-
portant to keep us ill-
informed.

I, hence, offer a suggestion
to the trustees, to the parents
of students, and to alumni:
do not be deceived by what
the Spencer administration
tells you about campus life
here. Do not think that
Davidson life is as idyllic as
it may appear to you during
your visit. Do not think that
the food you are served at
fancy banquets is the same
as the food which students
eat.

Leave your cloistered meet-
inggrooms and seek to de-
velop your own conceptions
of Davidson life. Visit the
dorms and the other places
where students and faculty
members are and see for
yourself what it’s like.

You may find, as I have,
that there are some good
qualities here. *

But do not be deceived by
what the administration
representatives say, for they
frequently wash-up and paint
over the little cancers which
fester in various parts of the
school. The administration
hopes you won't see those
cancers, But they are there,
and as soon as you leave the
cancers, though covered up
temporarily, will surface
again as the health of the
school returns to the con-
Cition it was in before you
came.

P.S. If you are an alumnus
and are planning to attend
the dedication of the so
called ‘‘new’’ Edgar Sentelle
Dormitory, do not be de-
ceived. The dormitory is
just old East Dormitory with
a- new plaque.
