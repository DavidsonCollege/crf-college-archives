The annual inter-fraternity
football program got off dur-
ing the past week with a bang.
Four teams emerged victor-
ious in the initial round of the
first Round Robin tournament
ever held here. e

In the first games the Phi Gams
whipped the Betas by an over-
whelming margin of 18-0, while the
Sig Eps were dropping the SAE’s
6-0. The Phi Delts turned loose
on the Pikas and licked them 18-0,
and the last game played before
this paper went to press, the Kap-
pa Sigs licked the Phi Fappa Phis
6 to 0.
