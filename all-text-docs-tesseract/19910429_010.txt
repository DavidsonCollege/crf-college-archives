THE DAVIDPHONIAN

JERRY TARKANIAN TO COACH THE WILDCATS

By Kenny Dunkitt

It’s official. As former
Davidson basketball coach Bob
McKillop heads off to the Middle
Eastto take charge of the Tel-Aviv
Prognostidigitators, a semi-pro
team led by former Wildcat star
Edward “Magic” Gaines, areplace-
ment was announced last Friday.
The lucky successor is none other
than Jerry “Tark the Shark” Tar-
kanian, the controversial yet be-
leaguered coach from the Univer-
sity of Nevada-Las Vegas.

Tarkanian, or “Tark,’” when
asked why he wanted to leave the
bright lights and gambling casinos
of the “city of sin,” not to mention
big time basketball, the bald and
puppy-dog-eyed coach responded:
“It’s ume for me tomove onand do
something I’ve always wanted to
do--coach the Davidson basketball
tcam. In 1986, when I saw them
play Kentucky on ESPN and heard
about their 1280 SAT average, I
said ‘wow, I didn’teven know you
could get those kind of numbers on
atestlike that.’ I’dreally like to be
part of that.”

After talking to Tark, The
Davidphonian went to President
John “Captain Kuyk” Kuykendall
to get his comments on Tark’s
hiring. We asked him if people
around here weren’t going to raise
a few questions about getting a
coach whose name 1s synonymous
with recruiting violations.

“Raise questions? Raise hell
is more like it,!” said Kuyk. “TI
mean, isn’t it time we put a little
excitement back into Davidson
basketball? I mean, Tark won ball
games out at (Las) Vegas didn’t
he? Well didn’t he? Personally,
I’m ready for some dunks. I mean,
this issue is really centered around
dunks isn’t it?”

Kuyk also added, “Ireally have
to hand it to Christopher B. “Kit”
Morris for his help in this transi-
tion. Bobby really surprised us
with his defection to the Persian

Gulf or wherever, but Kit was there

to get Tark for us when we needed
a coach.”

Athletic Director Terry Hol-
land, who for
some reason,
was . just
about to
leaveonatrip
to the Carib-
bean for a
while, said,
“Hey, I think
it’s great.
Tark’s (Las)
Vegas teams
from the past
two years
have been on
my top five
college bas-
ketball teams
since 1965. I
mean, if you
ask me, I’m
rcady to see
some alley-
oops and 360
reverse
dunks. This
Tark issue is
really cen-
tered around
dunks isn’t
it?” —Hol-
land’s wife,
Ann, had no
comment.

A few of
the most in-
teresting re-
actions came
from the
players. Junior Paul Rybiski said:
He’s a great coach. I sure like the
way he took a technical foul when
he tried to start all six of his (Las)
Vegas seniors for their last home
game. I sure hope he does it again
when I’m a senior!”

Junior Paul Denmond re-
sponded, “You know, this will be
my third coach in four years. I sure
hope this guy works out for me.

HUSSEY TO RETURN:

WILL COACH WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

By Gavin Macleod

Davidson’s athletic depart-
ment surprised the NCAA with its
announcement yesterday of plans
to field a team in Division I
women’s basketball for the com-
ing fall season.

Ata time when many are still
debating the merits of entry into
this highly competitive but lucra-
tive arena, Davidson’s golden boy
Terry Holland has taken the reins
and made yet another bold move to
wind up his freshman year as Ath-
letic Director. .

Holland’s plans have been
perhaps the best kept secret in
Davidson sports history, as he has
not only received approval from
the Board of Trustees but has also
signed a coach and seven scholar-
ship players.

Holland granted a brief inter-

view to The Davidsonian in which
he revealed additional plans to bol-
ster the bench with transfers from
the University of Tennessee and
Auburn. “Tam really excited about
the possibilities for Davidson in
women’s basketball,” exclaimeda
hatless Holland.

When pressed for more infor-
mation about his seven freshman
recruits Holland gleefully whis-
pered that they are all All-Ameri-
cans from Shelbyville High School
in Tennessee.

Those readers that keep up with
high-school women’s basketball
know that Shelbyville High is a
consistent contender for the na-
tional championship, largely be-
cause of the genetic superiority of
many of the girls in the region. —

~ “Who said inbreeding was a
bad thing,” chuckled Holland, “my

My slogan for next year is ‘more
P.T. for P.D.’”
Freshman Jason Zimmerman

said, “ Boy, I think I’m gonna get
used to this guy. He’s really nice
and much friendlier than I thought.
He has taught me and all my team-
mates a new way to shake hands
with Davidson alumni outside the
locker room after our games. Ba-
sically, I really can’t complain--

especially after all the things he~

gave us I mean, hey, we love our
new cars--uh, I mean, shoes. I’m

enjoying my new apartment, but '

daddy married my sister and it
didn’t affect me none!”

Many members of the
Davidson community will be glad
to hear that the coach of this prom-

ising team will be the equally prom-
ising Bobby Hussey.
Claims Holland, “Mr.

Hussey’s coaching style may not
have worked one-hundred percent
of the time with the men’s team

here, but I have a strong feeling _

that women’s basketball is the very
thing he needs to reach his full
potential.”

Holland refused to reveal any
more details about the team until
the press conference which is
scheduled for the Monday follow
ing graduation.

I’mreally not sure what I’m going
to do with the fur coat. This is
North Carolina you know.”

“T think we'll
be very good,” added
Sophomore Detlef
Musch, in English.

One of the
things about Davidson
Tark especially enjoys
is the academic calibre
ofits students and its ath-
letes. This was espe-
cially true in terms of
Tark’s notorious
“amoeba” defense that
literally ravaged NCAA
opponents all year.

“Now I won’t
have to waste valuable
practice time explaining
to the kids what an
amoeba is. Anderson
(Hunt) and Stacey
(Augmon), a couple of
my former players, sure
had a tough time with
thatone,” chuckled Tark
while wiping his fore-
head with his ubiquitous
towel. “By the way, do
they have science clagses
here,?” asked Tark.

Tark has also
demanded a few “minor
changes” to take place
on campus as a!
“condition”’for taking
the coaching position.
He wants bright new red
and black spandex out-
fits for all male and
female Davidson cheerleaders.
Secondly, the mascot will be
changed from “Wildcats” to
“Sharks.” In fact, the plush shark
costume formerly seenon TV atall
the UNLV home games is on its
way to Davidson at his very
moment.

“T never really liked Runnin’
Rebels anyway,” said Tark. “And
I certainly can’t deal with, what-
ever you are--what is it? Wild-

cats,?” again wondered Tark.

Thirdly, the Davidson pep band
is to be paid buckets of cash every
time it plays the “Budweiser”
theme song.

“Ivll be just like Vegas,”
smiled Tark. ;

Fourthly, although it hadahard
time passing through Residence
Life Director Richard Terry, who
later gave in to the new coach’s
special requests, Tark demands that
all his players will live in New
Building ‘D’ (soon to be named
Athletic Dorm ‘D’ or ADD) along
with the Davidson football team.
Each athlete will get the, entire
space normally reserved for four
students all to himself, complete
with free cable TV, stereo and
privileges to eat in the ADD res-
taurant for free.

“They wouldn’t let me segre-
gate my players from the grid-
ders,” said Tark. “That’s OK with
me though. I figure the football
players will like the monetary
bonus they’ Il be getting for rough-

"ing up anybody that tries to get at

my kids. Coach Dave Fagg has
guaranteed their full cooperation
and I thank him for that.”

Despite all these changes, Tark
feels the Davidson community has
already accepted him as one of the
family. “Oh yes, by all means.
Tark is already one of the family,”
said Kuyk. Poe

Mildred Williams, a resident
of The Pines, said: “Now they
(Davidson) have really got some-
one teaching ‘em basketball. I
can’t wait to meet... oh what’s his
name. Perhaps he’Il join the choir
at the Presbyterian Church over at
the college.” Williams also stated:
“T’m ready to see some dunks, I
mean, this issue is really centered
around dunks, isn’t it?”

Tark starts to work May 1,
1991. A reception for the new
head..coach will be this Friday
behind the Baker Sports Complex
at 4:00. We’re not sure if that’s

AM or PM.
