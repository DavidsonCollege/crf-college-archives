b'agg, Players Talk
About Drug Usage

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

In a major policy change in-
volving player-coach relation-
ships, a meeting between Head
Football Coach Dave Fagg and
several of his players who smok-
ed marijuana was indicated by
some members of the team.

When asked if such a meeting
had taken place, Fagg had ‘‘no
comment”. He did say, however,
that he had talked to a number
of his players about their per-
sonal lives and some of their
problems throughout the year.

“I would apreciate knowing
more about my players than
just on the football field,” Fagg
said.

Nonetheless, Fagg has a grow-
ing concern about such prob-
lems as drugs affecting mem-
bers of the team, and wishes to
learn a great deal more than
what he already knows.

“T’ve read the national statis-
tics and know what age groups
marijuana concerns,” he con-
tinued. *‘To me, it is a serious
thing: it isn’t good for you, if
anything it’s illegal, and I would
not like to see young men get-
ting involved in it.”

In regard to his squad mem-
bers, Fagg says “‘We
coaching staff) appreciate the
fact that these fodtball players

(the

trust us enough to give us the
privilege of sharing their lives.”

Some of the team members
themselves felt that this kind of
honest and open talk was ex-
tremely helpful to the whole
squad, and that more coaches
should adopt this type of atti-
tude in regard to the players
of their respective sports.

press me. That wasn’t true in
high school.”

All three of his classmates
have now departed, along with
the graduated Jim Cantrell and

Jeff Chetwood, leaving only
Weaver fiom last year’s top
SIX.

This has meant a big change
for the junior pre-med major
from Roanoke, Virginia, besides
just the obvious improvement
in the caliber of his opposition.

He is now the team’s featured
performer, which has brought
added pressure, and as the most
experienced member of the
squad, he has assumed much
more responsibility this year.

Weaver denied that he felt an
exceptional amount of presure,
but he did confess that he’s had
some trouble adjusting to the
tep position.

“T have to get geared for a
maich if I’m going to be press-
ed. I've been losing my concen-
tration a lot this year, and play-
ing number cone may have some-
thing to do with it,” he said.

Since he is the most experi-
enced member of the team (only
he and sophomore Bill Allen
saw varsity action last year),
Weaver has taken over the lead-
ership position and serves as a
steadying influence’ for the
young team.

“Both Allen and myself have
been working with the younger
guys,’ Weaver commerted.

“We can't do much about their

stroke, but we can help in strat-
egy and improve their doubles
play.”

Teaching others is nothing new
for Weaver. “Since I was _ six-
teen I've enjoyed teaching as
much if not more than playing.
I don't play much competitive
tennis in the summer, just teach
mostly.”

Weaver has worked the past
‘wo summers at Coach Harry
Fogleman’s tennis camp, and
Fogleman emphasizes the value
of his teaching ability.

“David is a real fine teacher,
and he knows the game well. I
have him play with each ofthe
younger boys, to help them. ov-
ercome foolish errors. This has
given me a great deal of help,”
Fogleman stated.

Commenting on the team’s
performance thus far, Weaver
said, ‘‘There is definitely more
potential than we've shown, We
can play better and should start
winning some matches.”

He also pointed to the fact
that ‘There is a difference én
the caliber of teams we've play-
ed. These northern teams have
not been as ragged and rusty
as I expected them to be. Their
timing has been very good."

Asked about his own game,
Weaver responded I’m playing
better than last year actually.
I've always been a late starter.

“It takes me a long time be-
fore [ can concentrate on
where to hit ‘he next shot rath-
er than just cn how I'm hald-
