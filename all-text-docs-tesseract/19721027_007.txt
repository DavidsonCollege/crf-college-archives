Boz Scaggs Stays In Rhythm And Blues

By JOE EARLE

In these days of country-rock,
when the steel guitar is treated
like an instrument for rock and
roll, it's nice to come across a
performer who continues to
experiment with rhythm and
blues.

It's even more exciting when
one stumbles onto recordings
made by a true rhythm and
blues stylist. a performer who
can rework the standard forms
into personal statements.

Boz Scaggs is such a
performer. On his new release.
“My Time”, Scaggs flirts with
several diverse r ‘n b styles.

ranging from Smokey
Robinson's ballads to New
Orleans rockers.

Scaggs has been around a
long time, starting with the
Steve Miller Band back in
heyday of San Francisco.
through Mother Earth, and
finally on his own. His
perseverance has paid off.

Scagg's music is intelligent.
creative rhythm and blues. Like
Van Morrison. The Electric
Flag. and other West Coast
rhythm and blues
experimenters. Scaggs takes a
freshness to his music that is
often lacking in the formulas
dreamed up in Motwon or
Memphis.

‘“‘My Time™ opens with
‘Dinah Flo”. as exciting a song
as Morrison at his best. The
bass rocks along as Scaggs
works against a chorus and
horn section.

Although he utilizes all the
traditional r ‘n b sections, a
tight rhythm section, horns,
background vocals. Scaggs puts
his songs together in a tight
controlled manner. There is no
excess here. just good music.

On “Dinah Flo". he cuts loose
with his vocals. working the
song to fever pitch with
Morrison-like vocal work.

But he quickly shows that he
refuses to stay stylistically in
one place. After a jumping
opener. he slides into “Slowly In
The West"’.asoftballad. .

Next comes ‘‘Full-Lock
Power Slide”. a hard rocker,
which is followed by a beautiful
little song. “Old Time Loving”.
and a quiet. jazzy “Might Have
ToCry".

But it's oS eoneet —
that Scaggs ycases his r
talents. This side could almost
stand as a study of various
stvles. He works with five
different branches of the
tradition in the five songs. and
every one works.

First comes
Lover”. which

“Hello My
is old New

Orleans music. It sounds like it
could have been slipped onto
Dr. John's "Gumbo" and no one
would have noticed, except for
the improvement in the voice.

Scaggs next brings in
“Freedom For The Stallion”
which shows New Orleans in
1972. It's an Alan Toussaint
song. with the chorus and horns
rising and falling around
Scagg's lead vocals.

From Toussaint, he touches
on a little Smokey Robinson
with ‘‘He's A Fool For You".
His voice is surprisingly strong
in the high range.

He rounds out the album with
a good rocker titled ‘We're
Gonna Roll"’, and the title cut.
*“My Time” features a variety
of sounds run together , including
bells and woodblocks.

Scaggs music has a lot of

roots; he owes a lot to a lot of
different styles, from jazz to
Van Morrison. But like
Morrison, he remains above the
traditions he works with,
making each song individual
and exciting.

It’s nice to find a person who
works within the r ‘n b tradition.
especially when that person is
as talented and as creative as
Boz Scaggs.

New Center Fights Parenthood

By GARY STEWART
Staff Writer

A Planned Parenthood Center
has recently opened in Charlot-
te where students in the area
may acquire contraceptives as
well as pregnancy testing and
counseling.

All types of contraceptive
devices are available including
pills. condoms. I1UD's and
foams. The clinic also provides
information on = abortions.
homes for unwed mothers.
adoption services, pregnancy
testing and counscling.

“Hf a person is sexually ac-
tive. the need for contraceptive
devices should be recognized.”
said Kathy Norman, associate

director of the center in

Charlotte.

ont ns the center has opened.
iss Norman said tha

students have been ee

“We've seen a lot of Queen's

girls,’ she said.

Miss Norman also hopes to
help Davidson organize a cour-
se in human sexuality in the
near future which other
colleges are already offering.

The center will help set up
“legal. medical” abortions in
North Carolina or Washington.
D. C., according to Miss Nor-
man. Under North Carolina
law. abortions are only done
when the mental or physical
well being of the mother is in
danger.

There is a_ residency

requirement of 30 days prior to
the operation which will cost
about $350. If an abortion won't
be granted in North Carolina.
then the center will help make
the arrangements in
Washington. D. C. where an
abortion costs about $125.

“We will help her face the
decision, financially arrange
the trip. and find a place for her
to stay in Washington.” Miss
Norman said.

Kathy Norman stressed that
“too many people consider
abortions as a method of con-
traception. An abortion is not a
good contraceptive when so
many others are available. 1 is
an emotional strain on the girl
besides being expensive and
inconvenient.”
