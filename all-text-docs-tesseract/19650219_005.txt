A TOUGH BREAK

Victory was sweet in Tuesday night’s 45-point
win over Wofford as the ’Cats proved that they
hadn't lost their touch, as many had suspected after
disappointing showings against conference celler-
dwellers Furman and Richmond.

But the usually sweet wine of victory was not
without its bitterness, as top sub Paul Briggs’ broken
foot bone was a hard blow to the Wildcats’ already
less-than-overwhelmingly powerful reserve corps.

The loss leaves nobody on the bench taller than
6-3, thus foul trouble with the big men could really
spell disaster for the ’Cats.

“it’s a tough break,” says Lefty, “but Ronnie
Stone has been playing some good ball for us as a
reserve and I think he'll do as well for us as Briggs
has been doing.”

The 6-5 Briggs, a senior, will be out for a mini-
mum of three weeks, but hopefully will be ready
for action by March 12, when the Eastern Regional
semi-finals are being held at College Park.

“Maybe,” muses Lefty, “the injury will inspire
the boys to work a little harder so that Paul will be
able to play some more.”

Maybe so. By the law of averages, he’s about
due for some good luck on his injuries. Last spring,
an elbow ailment ended his career as a starting
pitcher for Coach Stevens’ Wildcat baseballers.

FOGLEMAN RACKING UP

Tennis Coach Harry Fogleman recently racked up
on some more honors to add to an already long list.
His proposal at the annual meeting of U. S.
Lawn Tennis Association for a national junior tennis
circuit in the summer was approved, and Fogleman
was named chairman of the committee that is to
put the circuit into operation.

‘The new system elevates the Southern Juniors
and Boys Tournament, held annually on Davidson's
courts, to the status of a sectional tournament, one
of four in the country leading to the nationals.

Fogleman will also chair a three-man committee
charged with the responsibility of writing an in-
struction book for the USLTA on how to organize
and run junior tournaments.

In addition, Davidson's tennis coach was offered
the job as coach this summer of the United States
Junior Davis Cup team, but, he says, “I'll probably
turn it down because of lack of time.”

Little wonder.

IMPROVEMENTS AT LONG LAST

Duke Endowment came through with $20,000
recently to expand Davidson's athletic facilities for
students. ;

As Athletic Director Tom Scott points out, this
amount wouldn’t begin to pay for the gymnasium ad-
dition that is pretty badly needed, but the money
will help put in some outside playing courts.

According to Scott, “Probably ten handball
courts, four tennis courts, and two basketball courts,
all of an all-weather rubberized surfacing material,
will be built.” ; ;

Enabling students to play tennis in the winter
and expanding the over-crowded handball and bas-
ketball facilities. the improvements will do a lot to-
ward providing Davidson with a first-class athletic

LES

plant.

But major improvem

ents are also needed in

the football facilities, especially the dressing rooms

and the press box.

And the big problem—insufficient

indoor facilities for winter-time sports—still persists.

Sigs Stay Unbeaten;
Delts Only Challenger

With Bill Barnette rebounding
from last week's low scoring ef-
fort with 31 points and Bill Child-
ress contributing 20, the Sigma
Nus roared back from an 18
point deficit to tie the Phi Delts
and send the game into over-
time.

One overtime was not enough
and, Lefty's Wildcats could not
wait after the second extra per-
jod, so the Nus and the Delts
had to settle for a 71-71 deadlock
Thursday afternoon.

Goose Barrow steadied the
Delt. attack with 19 points as
Ronnie Hunt exploded for 26.
Buzzy Parker broke into double
figures with 11. The game will
be replayed at a later date and
will not affect this week's stand-
ings.

The powerful Kappa Sigs cap-
italized on the Phi Gams’ floor
mistakes and fast-breaked the
Fijis to death for a 55-51 vic-
tory. Playmaker Buddy Du-
bose’s crisp passes and his
teammates’ excellent shooting
percentage kept four Sigs in
double figures and Pete Ort
right behind with nine.

Ray Garrison hit for 14 and
Tucker Laxton, Stuart Burness

and Dubose each ten points.

nents in a row.

After ripping Richmond 83-73,
the nation's fifth-ranked team
completely annihilated the Ter-
riers from Wofford, 117-72.

The Richmond Arena crowd
witnessed a dull contest in
which the only excitement was
provided by the Spider's 5-11
guard, Spike Welsh. Welsh con-
nected on 15 of 25 field goal at-
tempts, most coming from at

SAE’s and the KA’s. The Betas
heave a 1-7 slate and the Sig
Eps have the cellar all to them-
selves with a record of seven
defeats.

In other action, the SAE's
smeared the Betas 64-39. and the
Pi Kapps topped the KA's 39-29.

least 15 feet, and led both teams
with 34 points. His 15 field
goals were half of Richmond's
total and kept the Spiders with-
in a respectable distance.

Junior jumping jack Dick
Snyder was brilliant on both of-
fense and defense for Davidson.
In addition to compiling 26
points and seven rebounds, the
North Canton flash held Tom
Tenwick, who averaged 19.3
points per game, to a mere six
points on one of eight floor
shots.

All-American Fred Hetzel con-
tinued to shine by throwing in 23
points and muscling 21 re-
bounds. Don Davidson with 10
points, Barry Teague with 12,
and Charley Maréon’s 9 rounded
out the scoring.

Playmaker Teague turned
gunner at the start of the game
and contributed eight points to
the 20-8 lead which Lefty's boys
enjoyed after six minutes of
play. His 12 points all came in
the first half.

Although the Wildcats exper-
ienced a below average shooting
percentage of 45 per cent, their
55-41 rebounding edge was de-
cisive. ;

The cagers played as though
they were glad to return to
Johnston Gym in smashing
Wofford 11772. A hot 60.5 field
goal percentage and a tight
second-half defense combined
for a lopsided victory in which
all 11 Davidsonians scored.

In running their season record
to 22-1, the home team led 57-43
at half-time and outscored the

toothless Terriers 60.29 in the/.

final period.

Captain Hetzel hit on 15 of
22 attempts for 33 points and
managed 15 rebounds. He
brought the sellout crowd to its
feet at one time by blocking
two shots in rapid succession.

Dole Leaves Football
To Enter Business

Former Head Football Coach Bill Dole has decided
to give up coaching football and enter private business.

In so doing, Dole is turning
down an assistant coaching po-
sition at the University of Rich-
mond. Had Dole accepted this
offer, he most likely would have
been given the job of backfield
coach for the Spiders.

However, Head Coach Ed
Merrick's staff has need of a
line coach as weil. The Char-
lotte Observer quoted Merrick
as saying of Dole, ‘‘We would
have complete confidence in him
in either position.”

Dole is ending a North Caro-
lina coaching career of seven-
teen years. During the past
twelve years at Davidson, Coach

Dole compiled a 43-66-4 record.
Before coming here, he ran up
a three year 28-3-1 record and
two state championships at
Fayetteville High School and a
7-2 record in one year with East
Carolina.

Tuesday, Dole announced that
he would take a job in the Char.
lotte area with a business con-
cern. He says his new job is
not connected with sports in any
way.

“I will miss sports tremend-
ously, after having worked with
them for so many years. My
final plans are not yet complete
but I will be working with per-
sonnel, which is what I am used
to doing.”

Crowd pleaser Don Davidson
twisted. turned, faked, and
drove for 24 points on 11 of 14
tries. Snyder's 14 points in the
second half upped his total to
20 along with 12 rebounds.

Guards Marcon and Teague
harassed the enemy with -spir
ited. defense and pumped in nine
points and four points respec-
tively.

Ronnie Stone led the rapidly
improving benchmen by canning
eight points.

Buddy Hayes and George
Lyons were the only bright spots
for the visitors. Hayes collect-
ed 25 points and Lyons got 23.
However, tighter defense stop-
ped Hayes and Lyons the second
half with only 6 and 4 points re-
spectively.

Although Coach Driesell was
rightly pleased with the show-
ing, he forecasts that, ‘‘A whole
new season starts with the
Southern Conference Tourna-
ment.”

After jumping to an ear-
ly lead, Davidson’s matmen
eld on to gain a 14-14 tie
in Monday night’s match
with The Citadel. The Wild-
‘eats took the first four
events to net a 14-0 advant-
age, but could not score in
the heavier divisions.
In the first event of the even
\ing, the 123 pound class, Joe
Buffington pulled a 14-2 decis-
ion over Citadel's George Cush-
nick. Buffington accumulated
10 points in the second period,
scoring two near pins, a predic-
ament, and a reverse.

at which time Citadel was a
top contender for first place in
the conference standings.

“CARDIAC KIDS’

Their coach, Mel Thompson,
called them the ‘cardiac kids"
because of the way that they
had won their first victories in
the closing minutes of each
game. Against Davidson, how
ever, their desire forced them
to be too tight, and the ‘Cats
made a runaway of it.

Saturday night. Davidson will |

be the uncontested owner of
the top rung in the Southern
Conference ladder as the Wild.
cats are the only undefeated
team in league play with eleven
victories. Overall they are 221
with the longest win streak jn
the country, 21 wins, and are
ranked fifth nationally by the
Associated Press.

Wig Baumann, a 6-2 junior, is
the Icading scorer for the Bull-
dogs, averaging 15.1 points per
game, the eighth highest among
Southern Conference scorers.

Guard Clem Hartley and 6-5
forward Jim McCurdy are two
juniors who may be threats to
the Wildcats.

Davidson has the top two in-
dividual scorers in the confer-
ence in Fred Hetzel (26.2 aver-
age) and Dick Snyder (20.6
average). They are second and
fourth respectively in field goal
percentage for the league.

The Citadel has an 8-4 confer-
ence record, holding the third
Position in the league standings.

USUAL STARTERS

Davidson will start its usual
five of Hetzel, Snyder, Don Dav-
idson, Charlie Marcon, and Bar-
ry Teague.

six man -on the squad, broke
his foot warming up for last
Tuesday's game against Wof

Coliseum for the second straight
year.

At 2 p.m. the fourth-ranked

Positions six, seven, and eight

On. Friday, the winners of the
‘two Thursday: afternoon games
meet each other in the first
game of a doubleheader. The
second game is between the vic-
tor’ of the two Thursday night
games.

Because of the odd number
of teams in the nine-member
conference, the team with the
lowest standing in regular sea-
son games is not participating
in the tournament. Furman’s
loss to The Citadel last Tuesday
night gave the Purple Paladins
a. 2-12 league record and elimi-
nated them from tournament ac-
tion.

FINAL SEEDINGS
Final seedings are indefinite,
as all teams have at least one

men and then came back to de-
feat an outmanned Emory
squad last week.

Powerful Georgia allowed the
score to be a close 48-45 by
swimming unoffically in many
events.

Davidson coach Dwight Shue
explained the reasoning behind
this gesture, ‘‘It wouldn't prove
anything for them to let out on
They spend more time in
the water and are consequently
expected to win.”

Tuesday the Catfish swam at
Emory and ended up giving fav-
ors just as Georgia had done.
They could have beaten Emory
a lot worse than the 54-39 score
indicates. “We pulled our
horses out this time,"’ said
Coach Shue. “Of course I would-
n't have done it if this had been
a Southern Conference team.”

The Bulldogs continued their

Bobby Howard then suffered
a 6-2 loss to the Bulldogs’ Bill

and the score stood 14-9 in fav-

The Citadel's Steve Schwanda.

sophomore Martin Miller decis- -

three more points to the Wild-
cat column.

Mike Bisard. one of two sen-
iors on this year’s squad, held
on to an early lead to secure
an 8-6 decision over the Bull-
dog’s Bobby Hammer in the 137-
pound event.

SIMS PINS

The last points that the Wild-
cats were to put on the board
for the evening came in the
well-matched 147 pound division.
Sophomore Jesse Sims, after
tying the match 6-6 on a series
of well executed reverses, pin-
ned Cadet Mike Conrad with
2:10 remaining in the third per-
iod. Sims’ victory brought the
match score to 14-0 in favor of

ed to Mercuro, however, on the
basis of his having more riding

pion in the 147-pound event, had

ols.

The match was even until

with 1:30 remaining. Schwan-

Bulldogs, 14-14.

away from him and not get pin-
ned, but I told him to go out
and win. He just got caught.”

Parker pointed out that two
members of the squad, Bisard
(7-0) and Buffington 5-0-2) are
undefeated this year. He was
also pleased with the perform-
ance of Jesse Sims. who now
has a 5-2 record.

Asked if he was happy with
the tie, Parker replied ‘Before

but after we were in front 14-0,
I thought we had it won."’
