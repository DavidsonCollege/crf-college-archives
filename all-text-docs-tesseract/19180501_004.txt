Among the slightly wounded men
tioned in a late casually list was the
name of Sergt. William Fl. Rogers, of
the class ef ‘13. He was reported
wounded several months ago, but his
later letters state that he has now entire-
ly recovered. After graduating at Da-
vidson, Sergeant Rogers entered — the
Medical School of the University of
Virginia. From there he enlisted last
year in Ambulance Unit No. 517. So
far as known, he is the first Davidson
man wounded.

KUMEN KAN SOCIFN TY HALL
IS BEING BEAU TIFIED

Repairs started on the Mu Society hall
last fall, will be continued this spring,
and the hall should be in first rate con-
dition by commencement time.  Adjust-
ment of the lights, several new curtains,
repairs on the windows, and consider
able cleaning up will make it quite pre
sentable.

Some items in connection with the
eu hall that might interest folks are that
in 1884 the society borrowed a thousand
dollars to furnish the hall. fe was then
that the desks were bought, but no stove
was installed until 1869. “The steps—
which had been outside before-— were
changed as they are now in 1890, and
the carpet and opera chairs were bought
in May, 1893—just 25 years ago. It
is possible that a carpet has been bought
since that time, but a handsome and ex-
pensive one was bought then, and it
seems likely that it is the one now in use.

The new service flag will be hung
behind the president's chair. ‘The old
chandelier will soon be disposed of.

IMPROVEMENTS MADE
ON COLLEGKH CAMPUS

While nature has been doing her best
to beautify the campus this spring, man
has also contributed his share. The light
posts in front of the library have been
given a new coat of green paint, which
puts then in harmony with the rest of
the campus. Werk has been progress
ing rapidly on the Senior gift and we

will soon be able to walk from Cham--

bers to the gym by way of the cement
steps and the “white way.” Some work
has been done on the gym itself. “The
shower baths have been put in working
order and will soon be in shape for use
by a visiting team. One thing more.
last week the campus was mowed!

On change cette fois le sujet; on laisse

tranquilles pour le moment les profes-
seurs, et on discute la parallele enonce
par Chateaubriand entre le peuple an-
glais et le peuple francais, Voici cette
parallele:

“Melange du sang allemand et du sang
francais, le peuple anglais decele de toutes
parts sa double origine, Son gouverne-
ment, forme de reyaute et d'’aristocratic ;
sa religion, moins pompeuse quet la re-
ligion catholique; son militaire, ala
fois lourd et actif, tout participe des
deux sources dont i] decoule. [1 reunit
a la simplicite, au calme, au: bon sens, 2
la lenteur germanique, l’eclat, Vemporte-
ment, et la vivacite de Vesprit: francats.

Fils aines de Vantiquite, les lrancats,
Romains par le genie, sont Grees par le

|caractere.. Inquiets et volages dans |:

Vadversite; formes pour les arts; civilises

scaux sans lest, au gre des passions; en-
thousiastes du bien et du mal; amants
pussillanimes dela vie pendant la pai;
prodigues de leurs jours dans les batail

portables chez I'etranger; tels furent’ les
Atheniens Wautrefois, tels sont les Fran-
cais d'adjourd’hut.”
