Meetze maps out Davidson energy measures

By ANNE GARNER
Focus Editor “

Schlesinger is now heading the new
Department of Energy, Carter has
released his newest energy proposals,
and in the interminable quest for
enlightenment, the Davidson student
ponders the question of an efficient
energy plan for his beloved alma
mater. Hardly.

There is a higher consciousness of
our energy situation. Yet to College
administrators, the maintainance and
improvement of present systems as
well as planning for Davidson Col-
lege’s future energy needs is the
subject of much concern.

“Admittedly, we’re wasting ener-
gy,’’ said Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr. ‘‘Yet we
have to be careful about how we spend
money to save money in correcting
problems.”

As outlined by Meetze, the Physi-
cal Plant has devised a three phase
plan for energy conservation which
will by spread out over the next ten
years. The first stage consists of a

“conserve-energy-by-the-way-we-use
-it”’ policy.

“We are cutting wattage, cutting
out some lights throughout the
campus, and are anxious to work with
a student committee to rework the
control cycles which regulate the
heating of dorms,’’ he said.

Presently, the heating operates on
an Sn and off schedule’’ of one half
on and one off at a time. ;

“We're conscious of the mistakes.
For example, the dorms are not
heated evenly--the fault of an-old
control system but we want. to correct
the mistakes from a comfort stand-
point as well as conservational,’’
Meetze added.

Included in Phase I is a plan to
reduce the number of lights in the
library, but not so as to atfect
operation. The library is partially
heated by air blowing over coils
heated by the lights.

Phase II will be comprised of the
wide spending of money for worth-
while improvements such as insula-
ting dorms, patching leaks and

insulating steam lines, and the instal-

The conversion to some other type
of energy use will be involved in
Phase III. This phase will be

Meetze installs experimental solar heating in
Ridge Road house in preparation for future

By AMANDA HALL
' Managing Editor

Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze has
installed experimental solar
heating in a-college owned
house on Ridge Road.

‘‘We’d been looking for a
place to set up an experimen-
tal project because we believed
solar energy has come faster
than believed for industrial
use than for residential,’ he
said.

‘He is experimenting with
the Ridge Road house ‘‘so

-that we can determine what
kindof equipment we buy”’
for new college buildings and
to ‘experiment on our own,”
said Meetze.

The College purchased the
house several years ago speci-
fically for this project, ac-
cording to Meetze, because it

has the square footage small
enough for a controlled expe-
riment.

The house was in a bad state |

of disrepair and condemned
several years ago.

After renovating the house
the Physical Plant insulated
the walls and roof, and plan to
insulate the floor so ‘‘they can
know just what they have
done.”

“The way we're (installing
the solar heating system is
that) we’re putting panels
outside so they’re easy to
reach,” he said. The panels are
in the southern yard of the
house.

The sun shining on the
panels heats water piped
through them. The water is
then run through a heat
exchanger over air blows and
heats up before entering the
heating ducts of the house.

The panels have a southern
exposure and can be rotated
enough to follow the sun
during winter months, but as
low-energy panels cannot
catch the sun’s energy year
round.

Meetze has surrounded the
panels with gravel that has a
scattering effect and allows
the panels to catch more sun
rays.

“We have a storage tank to
store the heated water,’’ when
it is not being used, said
Meetze. ‘‘We want to work out
a valve arrangement” to regu-
late and record the amount of
energy used.

In the event that suppli-
mental heating is needed in
the house Meetze has installed
ar electrical coil heater over
which the air will flow before
entering the heating ducts.
The electricity used for this

will be checked and regulated
on a seperate meter than that
used to measure the solar
energy.

“Ultimately we hope to tie
this experiment into our con-
trol room in E.H. Little Libra-
ry. We have a control in there
that will let us read the
temperature on the hour,’’
said Meetze.

At present the only temper-
ature and energy gauge is
located in the house.

it ready so we can use it this
winter,’’ he said.

Meetze plans to mount a
high temperature solar panel
that will follow the sun com-
pletely by rotating on an X Y
axis on the roof of the steam
plant some time in the future.

“Our idea there is that we
can take energy straight into
our steam plant,” he said.

Meetze’s main purpose for
the installation and experi-
mentation with solar energy is

“‘to keep some action going on
this solar business because the
more we can do the more we
can deal with the engineering

- of new structures on campus,”’

he said. ‘

‘Some of our new structures
will have provisions for solar
energy.”

Although solar heating is
“not a practical installation,
from a planning standpoint
you can not put an estimate on
it,’”’ he said.

Solar energy is much more
expensive to use than oil, coal
or electricity primarily be-
cause of the initial installation
cost. ‘‘But with the rising
cost of oil and coal this could
change overnight,’’ said
Meetze.

He does not have an esti-
mate of the cost of the panels
at the Ridge Road house
because the monies used came
from his general budget.

Meetze hopes solar energy
at Davidson first to heat the
water used by the College.
