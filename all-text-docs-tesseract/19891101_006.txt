X-country, field
hockey end on wins

By JOHN BURNS

Beach and Otrok lead cross-
country team

The Davidson cross coun-
try team ran well last weekend
at the Davidson Invitational
Cross Country meet. The team
was second only to a very
strong Brevard team. Both the
men’s and women’s squads
finished second in their respec-
tive divisions.

Chris Otrok once again led
the men with an 11th place fin-
ish. This finish is even better
than it sounds once you realize
that Brevard swept nine of the
top ten spots. Otrok pointed
out that the top five men for
Davidsonall finished within 42
seconds of each other.

“That’s a really good
split,” he said.

Cathy Beach finished first
for the ‘Cats and third overall
in the women’s division, con-
tinuing a very strong personal

season.

The tournament included
teams from Lenoir Rhyne,
Johnson C. Smith, Francis
Marion and West Georgia
(both of which beat Davidson
last year).

Field hockey has great week,
wins three

The Davidson Field
Hockey team knocked off
Pfeiffer Tuesday by a score of 3-
0. Goals were scored by Gigi
Cooke and Marjorie He-
vighurst. The victory left the
Lady: Wildcats with a 8-4-2
season record.

The team beat High Point
College 3-0 on Saturday in a
lopsided game. Earlier. in the
week the ‘Cats mutilated Sa-
lem 5-0. ;

The Wildcats came back
froma shaky early season and
midseason injuries to establish
themselves as one of the top
teams in the South.

After a rough weék, I
really didn’t want to write
this column. My editors
saved me, they assigned me
to cover the Ticket Policy. I
really think it would be in-
appropriate for me to write
an opinion piece onthe pol-
icy when I also had to write
the unbiased information

here writing these useless
sentences.
(Some of you might say

How about those
arena rules?

article as well.So, I’m sitting .

I always write useless sen-__

tences, but thatis beside the
point).

One thing though,
Shawn O'Rourke did say
the policy is possibly
changeable after this sea-
son. If you wantit changed.
fill up the arena and espe-

cially the student section at
EVERY GAME. The ball is
in our court, if we can geta
lot of people to every game
and show some dedication,
who knows? We might get

the whole bottom section.
