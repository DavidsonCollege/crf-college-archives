One might think from thé following ramblings that the
columnist did a niece bit of copying from the Charlotte Observer.
Hie would be somewhat justitied in that presumption, for Jack
Wade and stati covered-the Garolina game so thoroughly that
it would be-almost impossible to say anything about that game

here without some repitition,

The Observer gave the game

some fine publicity last week when the issue seemed in doubt,
which was largely responsible for the large crowd on hand for

the contest.

‘They were also complimentary to Davidson aitet

the smoke af battle had cleared, to a team that, though com-
pieteiy outclassed, made a gallant stand and at times put on a

show of their own,

Post Mortem on Saturday’s Game
Few Davidsonian’s had really expected a victory
over, Carolina Saturday, but they had expected a

close, thrilling game.

They saw a thrilling game,

with Davidson providing a share of the thrills, but
from the opening minutes of the game it was evident

that the ’Cats were in for a sound licking.

Perhaps

too much hope had been based on the fine victory of

Davidson over V.M.I.;

Carolina had been much

under-rated after its loss to the vastly improved State

Wolfpack.

The boys played with all they had, although

their defensive ling play was not equal to the task, and the cele-

delight of the Davidson fans.

Bill Dunn was rightfully commended for his excellent
defensive play, as the other linemen were trapped and
pushed all over the field. Earle Bethea’s kicking was
off for the first time this season, but he got off several

nice ones.

It can all be summed up thusly:

Just how important this game is may be clearly under-
a look at the Conference standings.

By winning’

these last two games the Wildcats will finish with a .500 per-
centage in Conference standings which is better than they have

managed to do in recent years.

Therefore Davidson must by no means deem to”
take the W & L Generals lightly, fora loss Saturday
would be the crushing blow. The Generals, it is true,
have had a poor season, winning only one game, against
Hampden Sydney. However, they have shown ability;
they did better agaist V.P.I. than we did and came very
close to defeating Richmond. It is reported that they
have the heaviest line that the ’Cats will face this year.

So keep your wits and fight about you Saturday, ’Cats.

The opportunity is at hand.
