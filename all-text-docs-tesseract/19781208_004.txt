Erwin, Ferarro battle for Davidsonian editorship

(Continued from page 1)

‘I want to become editor
because I love The Davidsonian
and believe in the importance of
journalism,’’ says Erwin.
“There’s nothing as good as a
good newspaper.”

For the past two summers the
Georgia native has worked as a
staff writer for the Albany
Herald. His news and feature
stories often rated by-lines and
several made the front page or
were distributed on the Associ-
ated Press and United Press
International wire services.

This year Erwin won a cove-
ted McGill Scholarship, spon-
sored by the Atlanta Journal-
Constitution. Such scholarships
are awarded yearly to the
most _ outstanding _ col-
lege journalists in the South.

As Erwin sees it, the paper
presently suffers from poor
organization.

“People spend a lot of time
trying to do the things they’re
not very good at, and don’t
have the time to do the things
they are good at.”

In an effort to remedy the
situation, he would like to see

the staff ‘streamlined ,’’ divided
into writing, production, and
business components. A spe-
cialized staff, he maintains,
would be more efficient.

Streamlining the staff would
be a very important step toward
meeting a more professional
production schedule, according
to Erwin. If elected, he intends
to establish a system of ‘‘stag-
gered deadlines’ whereby each
section of the paper (news,
sports, etc.) would adhere to
deadlines on different days of
the week.eThus, the workload
would be spread more evenly
throughout the early part of the
week.

“I would emphasize coverage
of future events in features and
sports,’’ he insists. ‘‘Of course,
the news stories have to be up
to the moment, and would take
up most of the time on Wednes-
day.”

Erwin states his major goal
simply: “‘Nothing is as impor-
tant to a newspaper as its
credibility.’’ Concerned about
accurate reporting, he wants to

‘implement strict measures

which he hopes would prevent

errors of misquotations, espe-
cially. Erwin would like to set
aside room in the paper for a
regular critique column written
by objective non-staffers, a sort
of ‘‘newspaper for the newspa-
per.”’.

Erwin would like to see
advertising revenues cover
more of the newspaper’s opera-
ting expenses. Presently, The
Davidsonian is supported by a
substantial amount of money
from the Activities Tax Coun-
cil, funds which other clubs and
organizations seek desparately.
Erwin feels that a better adver-
tising scheme for the paper
would leave more money for
other campus organizations.

Erwin would also like to add a
quality weekly sports column to
The Davidsonian’s content.

‘No matter who is the editor,
The Davidsonian will never be a
perfect paper. But I believe it
should be the best it can be.
And I'd like to try.’

If the final production dead-
line could be met consistently‘
Erwin explains, a better quality
printing job could be done,
which would serve to further
embellish the layout.

““T think it’s time to quit
using a high school kind of
advertising system.

Most importantly, skillful
use of ads can aid in displaying
stories and articles to their best
advantage.

Ferraro worked on his high
school newspaper as a news and
sports staff writer. His previous
involvement as sports editor for
his high school annual lends
phtography experience to his
assets. He also became a staff
writer for The Davidsonian this
term.

Yet Ferraro sees The David-
sonian editorship as “more of an
organizational position than a
writing position.”’ He feels that
the most important abilities he
could bring to the position are
in the areas of organization and
leadership. E

Ferraro organized and ma-
naged the Lacrosse Club his
freshman year. As Public Rela-
tions chairman for Sigma Phi
Kpsilon, he initiated and con-
ducted the fraternity’s greatest
fund-raising &vent-ever, a dance

American Cancer Society.

“The main reason why I
decided to run for editor,’’ he
states, ‘‘is that I believe my
strengths lie where The David-
sonian’s weaknesses are. Being
outside of the staff, I can
objectively evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of the
newspaper.”

Ferraro says that, if elected,
he would expect to work especi-
ally hard during the transition
period, as well as afterwards.

“You can learn about produc-
tion and editing, but personal
qualities like imagination and
tenacity are really important
too—and I have both of these
qualities.’”’ :

In regard to reporting, Ferra-
ro would like to see greater
coverage of SGA meetings and
of Senate actions as they affect
the students.

“If possible, I’d print the
minutes of these meetings as
well,’’ he says.

Ferraro conceives the role of
The Davidsonian as that of an
“all-around informational pa-
per.”’ To further the effective-
ness of the paper in this role, he
would expect his staff to gene-
rate “‘more news stories con-
cerning local issues and national
or state events which affect
Davidson College students.”

Ferraro sees a need for grea-
ter emphasis on art and cultural
events, to be handled by a staff
art editor. He would like to

expand the present reviews on .-

movies to cover other aspects of
the arts.

‘Students need a helpful
source of information on art,
movies, concerts, and other
similar events.”’

Concerning newspaper opera-
tions, Ferraro feels that he
“hasn’t really seen a great deal

of communication within The ©
Davidsonian staff. I think my
experience in organizing things
would help me make a more
efficient system within the pa-
per.

“I’m a firm believer in the
chain-of-command concept of
organization,’’ he says. ‘I
would want to delegate more
responsibility to the individual
editors within their sections.
My main responsibilities would
be in organizing and keeping
things running smoothly, but I
will do whatever I have to do to
help make it an excellent pa-
per.’’

If elected, Ferraro says he
“would like to keep as many
editors and staff writers on their
positions as possible. I don’t
plan on any wholesale change in
personnel.”’

As far as new younger staf-
fers are concerned, he maintains
that ‘‘getting freshmen and
sophomores to work for The
Davidsonian is an integral part
of achieving a long-range excel-
lance for the paper.

“T want people to view wor-
king for the newspaper as a
constructive challenge,’’ says
Ferraro.

While: he presently holds no
future ambitions in journalism,
Ferraro believes that he can
make his greatest contribution
to Davidson as editor of The
Davidsonian.

“The most important aspect
of the paper is service to the
student body. I am prepared to
spend whatever time is necessa-
ry in order to make ours an
excellent newspaper.

“Charles Erwin would be a
great asset to any newspaper,
he concluded, ‘‘but my
strengths are more in line with
what The Davidsonian needs.
