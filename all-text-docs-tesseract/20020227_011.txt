Women end season on high note;
enter tournament as No. 8 seed

‘By Erin DELK
Staff Writer

After a sluggish start, the women’s
basketball team clawed back to clinch a
conference victory in its last regular-
season game at ETSU, 72-68, on Satur-
day afternoon.

The Bucs jumped to an enely 15-5 lead
in the opening minutes of the game, but
by the 10:46 mark, the ’Cats were able
to slice the lead to a mere two points, 17-
15.

Davidson continued to build on the
lead by effectively executing their of-
fenses, and presenting stifling defense,
interchanging straight,man-to-man and
half-court traps, and only committing a
record three first-half fouls.

the half.up by six, 35-29.

Davidson switched to more zone defense
at the beginning of the second half, and kept
ETSU at bay until the 8:37 mark.

The Bucs went on a 13-4 run in the
next 1:40 to even the score at 62 all.

As sophomore Ashley Hallsted re-

marked, “The ETSU players had a lot of

energy out there because it was their
Senior Day, and they were making some
amazing shots, especially from the three-
point line.”

East drained five three’s in the second
half, as opposed to Davidson’s two.

Buc’s hot shooting and strong post
play, particularly from Misty Copas,
forced the ’Cats to switch back to their
first half man-to-man defense.

Clutch shots from senior Janna Magette
and red-shirt junior Bethany Schott, and

big rebounds from sophomore center

_. Meghan Bryant put Davidson back,on |
| top with 2:18 to go.

Davidson remained cool and col-
lected under late-game pressure and
fouls as they connected on several
crucial free-throw shots to end the
game with a 6-0 run.

Magette, Schott, and Bryant led all

points respectively.
Closing words from sophomore

essence of this game: “Winning our
last two conference games is perfect
momentum going into the tournament.”
Davidson will enter the Southern
Conference tournament ranked eighth,
and is set to play ninth seed Appala-
chian State on Thursday at 5 pm.

Loss to VMI prevents men
for winning title outright

,

The men’s basketball team traveled to
Lexington, VA, needing a victory to earn
sole possession of the North Division cham-
pionship for the first time in four seasons.

The Wildcats left with much worse than a
defeat.

Saturday’s 81-77 loss to VMI in Cameron
Hall dropped Davidson (18-9, 11-5) into a
first-place tie with East Tennessee State and

UNC Greensboro. The Wildcats still own the

No. 1 seed in this weekend’s Southern Con-
ference tournament due to a tiebreaker ad-
vantage, but will share the regular season
banner with two other teams.

“There’s no consolation in getting the first
seed. This team wanted to win the North
Division championship outright,” said
coach Bob McKillop. “They don’t want to
hang a banner that another team can share
with them. We just didn’t get the job done.”

Making matters worse, the team’s start-
ing backcourt missed almost all of the
second half with injuries. Senior point
guard Michael Bree was scoreless in 19

minutes, and left the game early in the
second half after injuring his leg jn a col-

lision.
Shooting guard Wayne Bernard aggra-
vated a hip pointer suffered in practice on

Thursday, and scored one field goal before
leaving 17 minutes into the game. Reserve
guard Peter Anderer, bothered by a stom-
ach illness, scored eight points in 32 min-
utes.

Bernard and Anderer are expected to
play in Friday’s noon quarterfinal game
against the winner of The Citadel vs. VMI,
but Bree’s status is unclear.

Despite entering the game in last place
in the North Division, the Keydets (10-17,
5-11) played like an inspired team on Se-
nior Day. VMI led 43-33 at the half, and
stretched it to 57-39 when Ben Rand hit a
three-pointer with 14:56 left.

The Wildcats fought back late in the
second half, pulling within 76-74 on a
Damion White three-pointer with 46 sec-
onds left. The Keydets answered by con-
verting five of six free throws over the last
40 seconds to escape with their first vic-
tory over Davidson in 10 games.

Redshirt freshman Jason Conley, the —

nation’s leading scorer at 29.3 points per
game, finished with 27 points and nine
rebounds.

Chris Pearson scored 22 points, 16 in the
second half, to lead Davidson in scoring.
Martin Ides had 13 points and freshman

‘walk-on Damion White, filling in for the

injured Bernard, tallied 10 points in just
six minutes played in the second half.

Health of Bi Bree, Berane Bree
unclear as men prepare for F riday

There are two ways for Davidson basket-
ball fans to look at this weekend’s Southern
Conference tournament.

Optimists would say the Wildcats (18-9,
11-5) tied two other teams for the SoCon’s
best record, beat every conference opponent
except The Citadel at least once, boast a
roster full of experienced veterans and won
two postseason games in last year’s tourna-
ment, reaching the semifinal round before
losing 73-68 to eventual champion UNC
Greensboro.

Pessimists might point out that Davidson
has lost three of its past five games, with two
of those losses coming against the North
Division’s worst two teams, Appalachian
State and VMI, and that injuries to would-be

starters Michael Bree, Wayne Bernard and

Emcka Erege will be too much to overcome.

We won’t know which side is right until
the weekend is over.

When the Wildcats take the floor at the
North Charleston Coliseum at noon on Fri-
day against the winner of Thursday’s VMI/
Citadel game, several questions will have to
be answered.

First, who will play? Senior point guard
Michael Bree injured his leg after colliding
with a VMI player in Saturday’s 81-77 loss
to the Keydets. He was walking withcrutches
as of Monday, and it’s unclear whether he
will be able to play by Friday.

Shooting guard Wayne Bernard aggra-
vated a hip pointer he sustained in practice
two days before the game, and was held out
of practice on Monday.

Bree (4) injured his leg Saturday.

But the up-and-down season also included
losses to the conference’s three lowest-rated
teams, VMI, Appalachian State and Western
Carolina.

Although Saturday’s loss to VMI erased any
momentum Davidson hoped to carry into
Charleston, Matheny says winning the first
game is all that is needed to get it back.

“All you’ ve got to do is win your first gamé.
Then you’ ve got momentum,” he said.

To reach Sunday’s championship game, the
Wildcats will need to get healthy in a hurry and
rediscover the winning formula.

Forward Emeka Erege returned to prac-
tice on Monday for the first time since
injuring his foot on Jan. 4 at Western
Carolina.

Assistant coach Matt Matheny said Ber-
nard has the best chance of those three to
be ready for action by Friday, but de-
clined to speculate on Bree and Erege.

Second, which team will show up? The
Wildcats have earned some memorable
victories this season, including the shock-
ing upset at North Carolina on Nov. 20
and the overtime comeback win at Penn-
sylvania on Dec. 22.

After opening the conference season
with a loss-at The Citadel, Davidson won
nine of its next 10 games, including two
wins over defending champion UNC
Greensboro. A road victory over College
of Charleston on Feb. 19 clinched the top
seed in the tournament.
