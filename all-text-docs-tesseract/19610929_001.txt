DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1961

President D. Grier Martin was
surprised last Saturday by the
presentation of a stuffed wild-
cat which was donated by Cal-
houn Hepp, a Davidson alumnus.
The surprise came at a picnic in
Greenville following the Dav-
idson-Furman game.

After Hepp had presented the
cat and related its history,
President Martin replied that
he was “very grateful” to Hepp
for the gift. He added that it
looked as if the cat had been in
the game, since it had lost its
tail.

Caught in a trap in the
mountains above Greenville a-
bout twenty years ago, the cat
had been stuffed and given at
that time to Hepp to console
him after a Davidson loss to
Furman.

Because the mantel in his
home is too small to hold the
cat, it will probably be placed
beside the other stuffed cat
now on display in the gym.

Martin recalls that Davidson
kept a live wildcat here during
the last war.-He feels, since Fur-
man has a live white horse as a
mascot, that a “properly caged”
cat could again be allowed.

In Schedule Planning

Students this week were extended invitations to sit on

Although this year’s Fresh-
man Class is barely settled, at-
tention has already been turned

to the prospective class of 1966

in the college admissions office. |
Some 31 applications for next '
year’s class had been received

through the middle of this week, |

H. Edmunds White, associate |
director of admissions, reported.

Fourteen of these are desig-
nated in the early decision cate- ;
gory. This is the new program
jnitiated by the college last fall |
enabling students considering
only Davidson to receive word
on their acceptance by Dec. 1.

“We are anticipating more
early decision applicants and
more to be accepted under the

‘plan this year,” commented

White. “Last year we accepted
28, and they all have enrolled.
There is no fixed limit on the
number.”

White also stated that there
will be some increase in the
number of college days which
representatives: of Davidson wil!
attend this year. This is mostly
due to the addition of Bill Bon-
durant, °58, to the staff of the
admissions office.

The fall schedule tentatively
calls for four or five days in the
following areas: Cincinnati-Co-
lumbus, Chattanooga-Atlanta, St.
Louis and New. York. There will
of course be the continued visits
to schools and communities in
Virginia, North and South Caro-
lina. Géorgia and Florida. areas.

The St. Louis and New York
trips will be in conjunction with
conventions and study groups.

were grateful for encourage-

ment from professors and other
members of the college com-

dent George Trask,

The move follows numerous
complaints by students and THE
DAVIDSONIAN concerning the
schedule and the need for con-
sulting student opinion in form-
ing it.

Trask and Bob Waugh, IFC

the Non-Academic Scheduling
Committee as non-voting mem-
bers. However, they may attend
all meetings and enter into all

holding these same offices sat
with the group

The innovation comes in the
addition of a non-voting mem-
ber to the committee which
schedules holidays, exams, blass
schedules, and dates for the
opening and closing of semester
sessions.

The committee recommended
to Dr. Martin this week that a
student be allowed to sit with
them. However, they placed sev-
eral conditions.

“The student - representative
would not be invited to partici-
pate in meetings pertaining to
academic scheduling per se;’’

“Davidson didn’t give me any
advice, they don't know any-
thing! I had the impression they
were opposed to my going!”

All seven agreed that David-
son should at least set up a
standard procedure to regulate
the transfer of credits. “As it is
now, you take your academic
life in your own hands to go
over there,” Sims said.

When asked to suggest im:
provements, most of the group
indicated that Davidson should
set up one office or one official
to be in charge of disseminat-
ing information about foreign
study and of advising students
academically. There should be
at least. one person on the fac:
ulty who understands foreign
universilies capable of helping
the student and evaluating work
for transfer of eredits.

Flag Pole Flagless?

The flagpole is finally up!
Massive disobedience on the
part of the student body pre-
vented its erection last spring.
But the college took advantage
of the summer vacation and now
the flagpole stands between
Belk. and Chambers.

However, one thing has been
missed. No flag has been flown

rently under consideration are five best-sellers.

Most recently added to the
best-seller list is A Nation of
Sheep by William Lederer of
Ugly American fame. Also being
considered are J. Edgar Hoov-
er’s expose of the Communist
Party, Masters of Deceit, and
Allen Drury’s prize-winning nov-
el of Washington society and
politics, Advise and Consent.

ONLY ONE PLAY

Another novel to reap praise
this past year was To Kill a
Mockingbird, an Alabama-cen-
tered tale by authoress Harper
Lee. The only play under con-
sideration is Arthur Miller’s well
established Death of a Seles-
man.

The Book-of-the-Year program
involves bringing an author of
a well-known book to the cam-
pus for a period of about two
days. During that visit he dis-
cusses his work in assembly, the
classroom, and in the forum.

ONE AUTHOR CONTACTED

Reid, in listing the proposed
books, stated: that one author
has already been contacted;
however, because of previous
engagements, Sen. Barry Gold-

water will be unable to discuss
The Conscience of a Conserva-
tive.

The committee has written to
several publishers for sugges-
tions for authors. This aid to
selection has proven successful
in the past. It was through
Doubleday & Co., last year that
Uris’ Exodus was recommended

INCREASED INTEREST

Interest in the Book-of-the-
Year has steadily grown since it
was initiated two years ago.
This is indicated by the YMCA’s
increased appropriation for the
program from $400 last year to
$700 this year, and, in addition,
the college is giving financial
aid.

Working with Reid, at the
present, are Dr. Max E. Polley,
advisor, and Bill Denham,
YMCA Cabinet member.

After an author has been ac-
quired, additional committees
will be formed from those 70
students who indicated an in-
terest in the program last
spring and also from interested
freshmen.

Most of
these wanted Rush Week to end '
before classes begin. Only five
favored delayed rush.

Students also complained of a
“poorly organized ROTC uni-
form issue.” About one-half of
the class of '65 found Col. P. F.
Wheaton’s talk on military train-
ing “satisfactory.”

“We were pleased to find
most of the suggestions con-
structive,” said Burts. Although
“nothing outstanding” came up
in a section for miscellaneous
comments, Burts noted a few
places in which ratings from
group leaders conflicted with
those from the freshmen.

Out of eleven group leaders,
three favored leaving out the
faculty reception, and two asked
to do away with the Fraternity
open house, instituted this year.
Eight of the leaders felt confer-
ences with their groups were
“extremely helpful.”

“We will use this evaluation
for next year’s program when
we make it up next spring,”
Dean Burts said.

college year.

When asked by THE DAVID-
SONIAN why no flag has flut-
tered from the pole, Robert
Currie, business manager of the
college, reacted with surprise.
“You mean the ROTC Dept. has-
n't been flying the flag each
day?” He was assured that no
flag has been present on the
pole this year. “Well,” he re-
plied, “I'll have to make a note
of that.” He did and suggested
that the ROTC Dept. be ques-
tioned about the. matter.

The sergeant in the Orderly
Room knew exactly what the
trouble was. He just had a hard
time explaining it. “You know
the things on the pole you raise
and lower the flag with? The
ropes? Well, they're all mixed
up. We can’t raise or lower a
flag, either one. But the college
has said that they will be fixed.”

The flagpole stands alone, un-
draped. But there yet may be
some action around it. And in
more ways than one, too. Some
students have expressed an in-
terest in taking it down.
