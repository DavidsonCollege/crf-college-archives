The Other Davidson

Until we began our series on The
Other Davidson, which ended last
week, chances are good that many if
not most Davidson students didn’t
know the place and its people existed.
Undoubtedly, some still don’t.

But regardless of whether or not
you read the series, The Other Da-
vidson is very real, and it’s-high time
that fact was realized. ;

As the articles pointed out, David-
son is not a unified community. More
than a railroad track separates its
residents.

Neither side really understands the
other, for numerous recent efforts
notwithstanding, custom and person-
alities and history still dominate the
whole relationship.

It hasn’t been a pretty picture. The
black people here have been manipu-
lated and misused in the past, and
even now the attitude of the white
community is too often one of patern-
alism rather than genuine understand-

ing.

This is not to say, however, that the

town government and the college
have not been trying to better a bad
situation. Recently they have been
trying very diligently, in fact, and
they have both effected a number of
improvements.
._ The college employs most of the
residents of The Other Davidson, and
just in the last few years wages and
other benefits have gone up signifi:
cantly, with a genuine promise of
more to come.

The housing situation in The Other
Davidson is generally wretched, but
last September a housing project was
begun which has led to construction of
20 new homes so far.

Employment has often been spotty,
but the influx of several industries is
helping. Segregation apparently ling-
ers now only in whites’ minds.

And where there has been mistrust
and misunderstanding between the

Culture

One of the hopeful signs about Da-
vidson’s cultural future that has
emerged this year is the expansion
and improvement of the Union’s Fine
Films program. We are not doomed
to a continued culturally rural exis-
tence if programs like this can be suc-
cessful.

However, season ticket sales indi-
cated a less than enthusiastic response
from the student body. Les than 165
tickets were sold, and many of those
were sold to faculty members.

One reason is probably that artists’
films.are something of a specialized
interest, but nevertheless flicks like

two communities, a Mayor’s Commit-
tee on Human Relations was estab-
lished five years ago in an effort to

-investigate problems and air griev-

ances.

But problems remain, mainly be-
cause too many people on this side
still fail to understand completely
what they are dealing with across the
tracks.

Unfortunately, we don't have a
ready solution either. More efforts
are needed. For a start, we need to
recognize the situation like it is. We
need to realize that gestures that make
us feel good don’t necessarily have
the same effect on the black commun-
ity. And we need to avoid a policy of
benevolence and try a little honesty
and straightforwardness instead. Then
maybe we'll be on the right track.

Re The Senate

Back in September we had a few
words to say on the matter of attend-
ance, or lack of it, at Senate meetings.
Recalling a long history of careless-
ness among student government rep-
resentatives, most of our words
weren't too complimentary, and among
other things we promised to print oc-
easional attendance checks on this
year’s Senate.

Our first report is elsewhere on this
page, and it shows that the Senate is
worthy of commendation. Except for
two members, attendance has been
good.

Just how accurate the figures are
is a little doubtful. The Senate’s sec-
retaries have been notoriously sloppy
at times, and attendance is not taken
when there is no quorum, which hap-
pened a couple of times last May. But,
like we said, most of the senators have
been there most of the time.

-It is a welcome change and one that
we are happy to report.

Vultures

“La Strada,” “Shoot the Piano Player”
and “Citizen Kane” are valuable even
to the untutored moviegoer.

The Fine Films program and the
New Cinema demonstrate a desire on
the part of the Union Board to risk
financial loss in order to expand cul-
tural opportunities and provide stu-
dents with an experience of a literate
and artistic media that would ordinar-
ily be inaccessible. Jeff Duffey, Dr.
Anthony Abbott and their committee
have acquired excellent films and all
that remains is for students to invest
the time and energy to see them.
Those who do will be rewarded.

MSA Espoused

Davidson's rather unique approach
to its students has been widely praised,
and rightly so.

When the college admits a student,
it is with the idea that he will be grad-
uated from here. And then Davidson
goes to great lengths to see that he
does graduate. Rules are often bent
and exceptions made, and consequent-
ly very few students are sent pack-
ing. In short, Davidson looks after its
own.

Therefore the way the college deals
with its married students is a little
surprising and disappointing. It rep-
resents a departure from the David:
son way of doing things.

In compiling our feature page on
married students here (see page three),
we used several reporters. They talked
to a lot of people and did a little
sleuthing, and despite the fact they
were working individually, their re-
ports all said about the same thing:
married students at Davidson have it
pretty rough.

In any given year, married students
make up from two to five percent of
the student body. And by virtue of the
fact a student is married, he requires
more than other students, particularly
different housing.

In this one respect, the college does
provide some accomodations—speci-
fically, eight units—and over the

years our married students, living
here, there and yon, have made do.

But the situation could be a lot
better.

It is regrettable that 13 of our cur-
rent number of 21 married students
have to live in non-college houses,
and it is even more regrettable that
one of them—a student not given to
that kind of thing—can charge, as he
does, that the college has been “in-
different” to married students and
their problems.

But he’s right, up to a point, and
steps need to be taken to help the
married students.

They have already done a lot for
themselves. They have gotten organ-
ized under the leadership of ex-Marine
Phii Hazel and they have indicated
they are willing to work.

_ Better housing they need most of

‘all, and they feel if the college can
just provide some land, the project
could be turned over to a private in-
vestor. Obviously the students could
guarantee him occupancy of at least
20 units on a nine-month basis. Presi-
dent Spencer himself has suggested
this approach, and it deserves further
study.

And in the meantime, the married
students say they need babysitters at
a reasonable price, too.

Coeds For Lehigh?

From The Brown And White
(Lehigh University)

Coeducation is finally getting at-
tention at Lehigh. The Goals Commit-
tee recommended that an outside com-
mittee be brought to campus to ex-
amine the feasibility of allowing skirts
to roam on South Mountain.

This action was not unexpected—
it has happened at nearly every all-
male campus in the past few years.
And it appears as though many such
institutions are reaching similar con-
clusions: coeducation is more desir-
able than an all-male environment.

Princeton has reported that the
better high school seniors prefer coed
schools. A Wesleyan University re-

port pointed out that “if male students
are to mature as men they need both
regular and natural contact with
women, and some preserves of male-
ness.”

The reasons for coeducation are
many and have been put forth on these
pages and by other interest groups on
campus. Benefits start with a more
well-rounded extra-curricular acti-
vities program. The academic impact
on the College of Arts and Science—
a weak point at Lehigh—cannot be
over emphasized. And from the find-
ings at Princeton it appears as though
for Lehigh to remain among the na-
tion’s better universities coeducation
is a necessity.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Howard Attacks Senate Analysis;
Swann, Moore Criticize Errors

To The Editor:

Franklin Anderson has a
vivid imagination. His article
of Oct. 25 could be dismissed
as cynically amusing, but
his exercise in fantasy in
the last DAVIDSONIAN (How
the Senate Works: An Analy.
sis, Nov. 1) crossed the thin
line from thé amusing to the
absurd.

In the article Anderson
divides the Senate into neat!
categories and tacks on
labels which often are flung
around loosely in this politi-
cal season.

Surprised to find myself
listed as a member of the
“conservative coalition,” I
asked Franklin how he came
by these amazing insights.

“Well, as I remember, you
voted against the diving
rule."

The “dive rule’ was a
proposal considered on April
23 and 25 which would have
required anyone who missed
a review for medical reasons
to remain in the infirmary
for 24 hours.

Beyond the pros and cons
of the plan. it seems difficult
to believe that opposition to
an inflexible rule, which
would place restrictions on
a student and would inject
outside and artificial induce-
ments into the Honor System,
could be used as an indicator
of conservatism.

Amazingly this unusual
logic seems to be the prin-
cipal criterion. Although in
his article Anderson reports
that ‘five vote consistently
conservative,”’ he offered me
no specific knowledge of my
voting record, and in fact the
week before had written and
even gloated over the fact
that (How the Senate
Works: An Analysis, Oct.
25) ‘“‘search of the Senate
minutes reveals nary an ac-
count of who voted how on
an issue.”’

He also mentioned my com.
ments in meetings and his
consulation with the Senate
reporter for THE DAVID-
SONIAN as influencers in
his analysis.

Franklin has been at few

RICHARD HOWARD
. Steikes back

Senate meetings. The Senate
reporter was asked not for
information, but for an as-
sent after the classifications
had already been made.

This letter is not intended
to be a personal defense. I
do not consider my conser-
vative label as a condem-
nation, but as a misrepre-
sentation, as is the bulk of
the article.

I won't indulge in a point-
by-point refutation of the
rest of the ‘“‘analysis’’ be-
cause the remainder is mere-
ly an even more far-fetched
elaboration on the same
theme — the fabricated *’con-
servative coalition’ thwart-
ing the also non-existant
“liberal establishment.”

I have noticed polity ten-
dencies among the senators,
though these leanings are
hardly as precise as an eager
reporter might like.

However, virtually unsub-
stantiated and highly opin-
ionated “news’’ stories ‘(with
the admitted and seemingly
sole purpose of provoca-
tion) can only serve to alien-
ate students and invalidate
THE DAVIDSONIAN as an
important communication
link between the Senate and

-the student body.

To The Editor:

A number of things have
proved disturbing to me about
Davidson since I came here
in September. The most re-
cent one is the treatment ac-
corded to those students who
were demonstrating in the
Union for the alternatives to
service in the Marine Corps.
Apart from ideology the only
observable differences in the
two groups were the neatness
of attire (leathernecks win
here) and the amount of ma-
terial available at the dis-
plays (peaceniks win here).

Both groups conducted
themselves in a quiet. orderly
fashion. The student group.
however, was told to leave
the Union. The reason given
for their expulsion was that
two groups may not recruit in
the Union at the same time.
Students may not recruit for
peace while the Marines are
recruiting for war.

I see in this move not so
much an attempt to enforce a
Union regulation as an at-
tempt to stifle a group which,
left unchecked, might dis-
figure the image of Davidson
College, produce storm clouds
in its blue skies, and upset the

Kenyon
Goes

Coed

By MELINDA KOESTER
In The Sweet Briar News

Kenyon College has done
what many think Sweet Briar
should do. Last week ground
was broken for a coordinate
college, which as of now is
nameless. Kenyon is a small
private liberal arts men’s
college in Gambier, Ohio.

The school believes that
the answer to today's prob-
lem of the ‘‘small segregat-
ed college’ is not to admit
girls nor to improve its
present enrollment (750) but
rather to construct a separ-
ate coordinate school for
girls, with an enrollment of
600.

More than one faculty
member and member of the
administration have stated

that this plan is the answer

for Sweet Briar (Fletcher
College?) but that the main
problem is a lack of funds.
A cost of 15 million dollars
has been heard for Sweet
Briar.

Kenyon received its
funds through a bond issue
from the Ohio Hughes Educa.
tional Fund. This plan shows
a greater cooperation be-
tween privately sponsored
colleges and the state. gov-
ernment. But that's in Ohio.

In the ground-breaking
ceremonies the chancellor of
the Ohio Board of Regents
told the Kenyon community
“You don’t know what you've
been missing!" Fletcher

Conservatives, Liberals
Fight [It Out In Senate

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

President Joe Murphy lean-
ed back in his chair and
twirled his brown handlebar
mustache.

“About 20 percent of the
student body is living in in-
tellectual poverty,” he said.

An immed-
jate contro-
versy arose
between the
liberals and
conservatives a
in the = stu-
dent Senate [I 5<S)
as to how ‘
the poverty wf”
program
could be fi-
nanced. ‘*Pri- WILLIAMS
vate  contri-
butions."* vowed the conser-
vatives, “Larger SGA bud-
get.’’ responded the liberals.

Then Sen. Rich Cowart (L-
Davidson) arose to propose
gun control legislation. ‘‘Vio-
lence is increasing in the stu-
dent body at a dangerous
rate."" he maintained. When
reminded that the Senate had
already appointed a gunroom

keeper, he sat back down.

Sen. Frank Murphy (L-
Davidson) then got up and
proposed a voting machine to
make elections more realistic
at Davidson. ‘‘Besides, I'm
getting tired of counting the
damn ballots.” Although his
seniority should have entitled
him to special considerations,
apparently he was not on the
right committees, for his pro-
posal was defeated.

Sen. John Passmore (C-
Davidson) then arose to make
a speech favoring self-sched-
uled exams. Reminded that
he was a conservative sena-
tor and should not favor such
a move, he replied bluntly.
“I'm a liberal conservative.”

Sen. Gary Cash (C-David-
son) stepped up to address
the Senate concerning student
recruiting of Negroes, gener-

ally considered a_ liberal
measure, which he has work-
ed for. “I feel that I can do
this and maintain my conser-
vative stance,”’ he said, ‘‘be-
cause I do not favor making
the Negroes come to David-
son, just give them the op-
portunity.”

President Murphy — then
recommended to the Senate
a name for appointment to
the Court of Appeals. Immed-
iately senator after senator
arose to object vigorously to
the candidate and his qualifi-
cations. The speeches con-
tinued for six hours and the
filibuster finally broke up at
3 a.m. in wild disorder.

At the end of the melee a
DAVIDSONIAN reporter
managed to catch Sen. Covey
Carter (C-Davidson) for just
a brief interview. ‘‘Sen. Car-
ter, we have recently read
conflicting stories in which
yeu were classified as both
a moderate and a conserva-
tive? How can you explain
this?"

“Well.” Carter said, ‘‘you
know the press as well as I
do.”’

It fs a widely accepted be-
lief that colleges are not
democratic institutions.
Whether they are democra-
tic or not, however, should
not inhibit the right, indeed
the responsibility, of its stu-
dents to present alternatives

A Failure

The Omicron Delta Kappa tapping last week was
a failure.

True, some men who deserved the honor were
recognized as they should have been. And equally true,
some were not recognized who should
have been, and, by the same token,,
some were recognized who should
not have been.

I have debated with myself for
a long time on whether or not to
write this column, which by the na-
ture of the subject is necessarily
mud-slinging, and for that reason -
necessarily offensive to some.

I have chosen to say in print what 4 |
should perhaps be said only in
private for two reasons:

First, because by his’ required
presence at the tapping ceremonies, each student gives
tacit credence to the honorary purposes of ODK. That
there must be some peons around to do the honoring
of those honored is implicit.

Second, because the tapping is done publicly, its
failure should be cited publicly.

What should be completely apparent to anyone
who has thought twice about the ODK tapping is this—
the selection process currently in effect needs an over-

aul.

According to a member of ODK, the selection
process is governed rather strictly by guidelines set up
by the national organization.

The selection process works like this. To be select-
ed to membership, a student must be outstanding in
only one of five areas of leadership: scholarship, ath-
letics, student government and religious and social
life, publications, and dramatics, music and art.

This student must be in the top 35 percent of his
class. (This requirement may be waived, however, if a
local chapter unanimously elects a student to member-
ship, and then goes through the folderol of applying
to national which normally meets only once a year.)

If the student meets the above qualifications, he
must be voted into membership by a three-fourths vote
of all the student members of ODK meeting with a
committee of four fratres in facultate who also vote.

Apparently this system is not working as it
should. I find my credibility strained to believe that
eight of the present 16 outstanding leaders on campus
as cited by ODK are members of one social fraternity.

Of course, no matter how hard the national ODK
organization has tried to objectify the subjective, the
subjective still plays some part, as it does in all things,
in the voting.

The two major flaws, however, in the system,
both nationally and at Davidson, seem to be in the
very definition of leadership.

__ First, leadership has been equated with scholar-
ship. This is the false assumption that if a man is an
outstanding scholar, yet has done nothing else on
campus of outstanding merit, he is also a leader. 1
have always thought that leadership had to do with
leading men, not leading your class in grades and
smarts. So ODK recognizes the leaders in grade-grub-
bing, who are rather “automatic” members, I’m told.

_ What happens to the man, I wonder, who has
achieved a sound academic record at Davidson, who
has devoted his time and talents to leadership, but
who doesn’t quite have the grades to make ODK? In
practice, if not theory, at best he must settle for the
little-publicized accolade of “Who’s Who,” and other
than that, remain unsung. If observers of the David-
son scene know little else, they at least know those
who should have been honored and, unfortunately,
weren't.

Second, I find it represensible that ODK members
may be selected on the basis of leadership in activi-
ties for which they receive some sort of monetary
compensation, either as a cash payment or as scholar-
ship for services rendered. ROTC leadership and
athletic prowess which is paid service should not be a
basis for ODK selection. ‘

I do affirm that these men’s leadership is a very
real and vital part of campus life. I also say that both
ROTC and athletics have their own honors: Scabbard
and Blade and Distinguished Military Student awards
for ROTC and lettermen, most valuable player, etc.,
awards for athletics.

_ _ It seems that if ODK, which is assumed to be the
highest leadership honor not only at Davidson but
across the country, is to have any meaning or worth as
an organization, it should reform its selection policies.

After all, if you can't do what you're supposed to,
you shouldn't try to make People think you are. It’s
time ODK bridged the credibility gap.
