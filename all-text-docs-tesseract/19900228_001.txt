South Africa at Trustee reception

By SUSAN PEARSALL
Ina bid tocommunicate with
the college’s Board of Trustees
on theissue of divestment from
companies with ties in South
Africa, a group of close to 50

students participated in a “si-
lent sit-in” last Thursday. The
sign-carrying but otherwise
placid demonstrators greeted
the Trustees at a catered recep-
tion in the lobby of Chambers

Trustees attended a reception in the "abby of Chambers.

and remained until the Trus-
tees and other guests of ‘the

which demanded “nothing
less than the total divestment
of Davidson College from
companies that continue to
conduct business in South Af-

+ eq It
' Tica.

The demonstration was or-
ganized chiefly by freshman
Heather McGarrah and sopho-

‘more Stephanie Lindemann,

with the help of SGA president
Tripp Helms and Chaplain
Chuck Hasty. It was intended
to supplement Helms’ call for
divestment that he presented
at the Trustees’ winter meet-
ing. He explained that the
sizeable turnout for the sit-in
“shows the Trustees that [di-
vestment] is not just my idea.”
McGarrah expressed some re-

_ Bret that the lack of faculty

participation was the result of
the protest’s having been
planned in 48 hours, but was
pleased withthe number of
student participants. The
group was exceptionally di-
verse and included a signifi-
cant number of international
students, African-Americans
and whites.

Some of the protestors met in
front of Richardson before
going to Chambers to distrib-
ute signs and to hear a few
words of encouragement from
sophomore Clement Radebe, a
South African native, and
Helms. Radebe told the stu-
dents, “I don’t think that di-
vestment will hurt black South
Africans. They might lose a
little money, but they don’t
have much to lose. The whites,
who have everything, stand to
lose much more.” Sophomore
Marcus Geist agreed.”South
Africans say that if the U.S.
divests completely, it’s still not
going to be much worse [for
black South Africans] than it is
now.” Sophomore Jay Kirtley
saw himself as “giving my tacit
approval to the apartheid sys-
tem by attending this school.
Instead of transferring again,
I’m doing my best to change
this repugnant situation.”

false alarms |

By JENNIFER WHITTINGTON

If you were confused by the alarm
clock sounding buzzer which rang ev-
ery hour in Chambers last week, you
were not alone.

According to the Dean of Academic
Affairs’ office, turning on the buzzers,
which signifies the beginning and end
of classes, was unintentional. Because
of old wiring, a request from the Dana
Science building for the implementa-
tion on that building resulted in both
signals being turned. on. The physical
plant wasinformed of the wiring glitch,
and an absence of the unpleasant
alarms this week suggests that the prob-
lem has been corrected.

Inside

Last Thursday: someone turned loose
a live opossum in Richardson. Mean-
while, while leaving Chambers late the
same night, Jon Giles and Missy
Meegan happened upon a dead fox
lying outside the center door. They
contacted the Davidson police and
Officer Emory McLaurin made the call.

The following is taken directly from
the incident report of that evening:

“ After arriving in front of Chambers
I found what was a small gray fox that
looked like it had been run over by acar
and carried to the campus and placed
on the front steps of the building.

The fox was lying on its side with its
back to the base of the second column
coming from thenorthend of the build-

ing.’

“satanic sign of some type. The sign Within the charcoal circle, a five-

was drawn with black chalk or char-

coal and was
about 12 to 18
inches round.
“There also
was a student
in the lobby of
Chambers
studying and
she had been
there forabout
15. minutes

beforeJonand _

Missy came
out. and she
stated she had

markings can
still be seen
outside the
middle doors
of Chambers.
Although
many specu-
late that the
fox represents
a form of sa-
tanic ritual,
Officer
McLaurin
says, “I hope
it’s just a sick
joke and noth-
