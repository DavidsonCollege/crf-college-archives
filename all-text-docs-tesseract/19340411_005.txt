COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS
TO COMPLETE STAFFS

(Continued from page 1)
Jack Williams, president of the board,

Odi Casali, and W. L. Fugate.
The board has held regular meet-
— ings throughout the year and has dis-| -
cussed various problems which have
arisen in connection with publication
work, such as questions of finance and
management. The members of the
board believe that the publications at
Davidson have been unusually success-
ful this year in handling their prob-
lems, in spite of the fact that adver-
tising, the chief source of revenue, has

been somewhat decreased.

The present business managers of
the publications are: B. O. Ravenel,
manager of the Annual; W. T. John-
son, manager of the college paper; A.
W. Colwell, manager of the college
magazine, and J. A. C. Wadsworth,
manager of the handbook.

These men will continue their work
until the end of the year, and they will
help the new managers to become ac-
quainted with their work.

The University of Florida debate
team has just concluded a 14-day tour
of the middle west, where they met the
debate representatives of leading col-
“Wéges and universities. TO
