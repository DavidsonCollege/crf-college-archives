Dry Dances Complimented

(Continued from Page One)
The above editorial appeared in the Char-
lotte Observer a ago. We are
justly proud of our dances and appreciate

few days
this compliment.
A_year_ago the Davidson

the stu-

abolishment of
dances was being considered, but
dent body rose to the occasion and a method
of student control was inaugurated which

has proved very successful. Of course there

are violations of the rule““nothing is per-
fect—but these are mainly by outsiders
and have been very, inconspicuous. We
challenge anyone to find a college whose
dances are,on a higher plane than those
at Davidson.

campused by the Court of Control on a
three-fold’ charge which may be summed
up in the trite phrase, “poor spirit.” Hardly

Americanism

Is a term that we hear used frequently.
It looks good to find a paper that displays
its patriotism all over the editorial page,
using such phrases as “against all isms but
Americanism.” Occasionally people and poli-
ticians as well as papers use such talk. If one
doesn’t think about such things, he is likely
to stop and admire the patriotism of one
who speaks out so boldly for his country
and its ideals. However, we find that very
often the users of such phrases are not de-

John’s girl is fair as a morn in May,

Her mouth is made for laughter, ,
and she laughs all the day.

She’s just the right size, about five feet two

Her nose is up-turned and her eyes are blue.

She has tiny ears and curly brown hair,

She’s a nifty dancer, this maiden fair.

BUT—John’s girl is bad; my girl is good.

Do you think I’d trade with John?

Gosh, you know I would!
