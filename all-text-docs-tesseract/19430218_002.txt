‘main on the campus for his dances.

All during last summer while we were
away trom college we were wondering
What the school and the Pan-Hellenic
Council had in mind about ways and
means of remedying the social situation
that would face Davidson on its opening
in the fall, The only solution that seemed
to us at all practical, in the light of the
ditficult transportation problem, was the
olution of dances on the campus. ‘To ob-
tain this last, we knew it to be necessary
to first obtain permission of the faculty
of the school, and work through them to
vetting permission from the Board of
Trustees of the College. whose say-so
wold be final,

Chis was obviously the duty of the
Pan-Lellenie Council, as representatives
of the social life of the school, and the
backers of all previous Davidson dances.
Qn returning to schoel,we heard from

ious sources that a petition had been

drawn up, and indeed had been submitted -

to the faculty social. committee, who had
vpproved it. Our hopes began to rise: we
could see the Davidson student of the
near future being able to enjoy a good
ime right here on the campus, without

nerve-racking experience of having
to meet a date in Charlotte, bring her
hack to campus for ameal, then pack her,
hag and baygage, evening dress and all,
nto one of Mr. Greyhound’s buses for
‘he Jong, crowded trip back to Charlotte.

ne about; you had to go through with it

having to. go tow the worry and bother
and alarm that a modern dance in Char-

And then the dream bubble broke.
The resolution got no further’ than the
faculty committe. — It that the

Now, we don't know all the ins and

decision. But we do think they are miss-
ing the best gpportunity they-have ever
had to obtain dances on the campus. At

ditions been so pressing---conditions
that should certainly warrant at least

need for tHe social life- more than-ever
in the strain and Stress of the next few
months and years. And dancing, it
seems, is the only form of social that
will make a genuine appeal to the vast
majority of the Davidson student body.

And the same is true, if we look at it
from the point of view of the faculty and
trustees. The day may not be far off
when they would rather see the Davidson
student have his dances on the campus
rather than go all the way to Charlotte.
We have heard several people of auth-
ority and influence in the school speak
in those terms already. Tf we can get
the campus dances now, when.they are
so urgent, it will greatly simplify the
problem of keeping them campus dances.

The Operating Table

The writer must admit that h >
knowledge of the week-end’s hap-
enings was limited by a disappoint-
ing excursion to the Hill, where
hilarious Davidson spirits were
thrown for a loss from the start by
a painful Friday night.

However, a few of the old faith
fuls came through and their iimited

experience we will endeavor to re

hash. Lard, of the recently-pinned-
up Monsters engertained the Uni-
versity Kapper Alpher chapter
with a one man floor show. Did
everything but juggle three seals
on his nose, we-hear.

Clockwork Phillips, who sets the
G'boro bus schedule, and his fellow
lockce Hips, spoiled the hours be-
tween Thursday and Sunday for all
concerned by moping ovér inissing
persons.

Beny Lacy completed the wreck
ing of the ditto-Carrow-West pyra-
mid by spurning his true-love for
the latter. Harvey, the Pekid Pen-
guin, viewed the drama, admitted
that it shouldn't happen to a dog,
and disappeared into the night.

Flash! Long John Belk ijimped
onto the floor with none other than
Roselyn Ried of the Charlotte fam
ily of the same name. Why so
fickle, kid?

Wilbo and Simmonds started sev-
eral places only to find themselves
(over their own dead bodies) with
Ru-
mor hath it that the former is hen-
pecked.

Sutt. found the week-end
profitable, earning expenses for the
entire trip, at the expense of Dottie
and the hospitable K Sig chapter.

But to return to matters of more
local interest. The social season in
nearby Charlotte reopened with
capital BANG. Grand-Dad Moore
instigated the debut by squiring
the Queen of the Towel Queens,
who broke things up when her
youngest grand-daughter paged her
in the Bamboo.

Hungry Henry Gwynn, more ten-
acious than his mates, somehow
missed the Davidson stop on the
hoot-owl trip in and was forced to
make his own way Sunday after-
noon.

Tricky Dicky Smith, recently
elected trigger man for the—Lim-
bers, pulled a silent one to a doubt-

quite

ful destination somewhere in Vir
ginia. Dame Rumor again murmurs
‘true love”. What's the echo, Dick ?

ternation in the Fiji lodge by de-
positing in its collective midst’one

To illustrate our point, we cite
the famous trip that Wee Wee
McGee recently took to attend the
annual dance of the Female Truck-
sters’and Hod Carriers Union, Lo
cal No. 62 (a division of CIO). Wee
Wee, totally unprepared, found him-
self at an utter loss. At most dances
he would no sooner say, “I went to
Montreat I was fourteen,”
than any girl from a school within
a 300 mile radius would exclaim, “A
Sigma* How wonderful " Thus, he
would completely identified
himself. But none of the hefty te
males of F.T.H.C.U., Local No. 62,
had ever heard of Montreat. Sigma,
or even of Davidson.

Then Wee Wee tried the coy ap

on the good dancing of another, to

The conversation Was almost en-

Wee proved most inadept, and could
not even say so much as “nuts and
bolts.” Whereas Wee Wee before
