VIRGINIA CLUB HAS | ...
FIRST FEED OF YEAR

The Virginia Club held its first feed this
year last Friday night in 11 North Bar-
racks.

John Grey’s table groaned under the
weight of fruit, cakes, ice cream and peanut§,
The entire club of 18 members willingly gave
John a rising vote of thanks for his work
in preparing the spread. After which it
joyfully made away with the afore-men-
tiorled made-in-Virginia products.

A short business session was held, and
the following officers elected: H.M. Mor-
tis, president; Paul Price, vice-president,
and E. C. Moomaw, secretary- -treasurer,
President Morris delivered his inaugural ad-
dres§ urging a closer bond of friendship
among ‘the Virginia men on the campus so
that the Old Dominion may better be put’ on
the map at Davidson College.

Next came the most enjoyable part of the
evening, each man contributing his share
witha short story of his home town in Vir-
ginia, and some jokes. From Bob Gordon's
characterization of Fort Defiance as |the
“Mecca of the South”-to Henry Morris’ of
Staunton as “God’s Country,” Virginia wit
was enjoyed, The wit of the crowd flowed
freely until jl :30, when they disbanded with
a loud “Fifteen for Virginia” on the campus,

}and a resolution to have another feed soon.

GEORGIA CLUB MAKES
PLANS FOR THE YEAR

There was a regular feed at the Civic
League Hall Saturday night when 47
Georgia “Crackers” got together for their
annual set-to. Bill Baker, the president of
the august organization, presided with due
solemnity and gave the signal for festivities
to begin.

After the feed Baker called on Sorrells,
the boy. from Calhoun, to give an ‘address of
welcome to the Freshmen. This he did in
fine style, stressing the need of new men get-
ting into some sort of college activity. Fred
Franklin gave a fitting response to the
“President and Gentlemen.” Hillhouse and
Gallaway also gave short talks.

The next number was the introduction of
the members, each man speaking for himself,
There was much discussion as-to-whose town
was the best and finally the contest was de-
clared a tie between Fraser, of Hinesville,
and Franklin, of Lithonia. The general
opinion is that Gamble would have won out
for Macon had it not been, as Fresh Frank-
lin said, that it. was too far away from
Lithonia.

The Georgia club is planning a progressive
program this year, to-wit—a scheme to get
in touch with the High Schools of the State
and let them know just why Davidson is the
best college for them to attend. A commit-
tee to attend to this consists of Elkins, Sor-
rells and Gallaway with Elkins as chairman.

The occasion was closed by a Georgia
song rally led by Sorrells and featured by
Gamble’s rendition of “I’m a Rambling
Wreck.”

D
TRIP TO GREENSBORO
TAKEN BY QUARTETTE

On last Thursday afternoon the David-
son College Quartette, composed of ‘Ted
Jones, Bob McLeod, Victor Brown and J.
L. Green, left the college for Greensboro to
help in the raising of funds for a “Bigger
and Better.Davidson.” ‘The train crew must
have sympathized with the Greensboro peo-
ple for they allowed a drawhead to break,
and left the ambitious singers sitting on the
road, They softened their hearts, however,
and returned, picked up the song birds, and
completed the trip. Nick Carter met the
quartette.

‘The business conference met at the First
Presbyterian Church. Dr. Henry Louis
Smith, former president of Davidson, now
president of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, was the principal speaker of the eve-
ning. Doctor Smith’s speech was a wonder-
ful study of world conditions, as well as a
polished oration.

The other speakers were Doctor Wells, of
Columbia Seminary; Mr. Lockhart, who is
managing the financial campaign, and Doctor
Eghert M.. Smith, secretary of foreign mis-
sions of the Southern Presbyterian Church.
The quartette sang at intervals throughout
the entire program, all the numbers being
well received.

Arrangements were wane for an engage-
ment at N. C. C. W. for the Glee Club some-
time this fall.

The next trip for the quartette will be to
Tarboro,

WILDCAT WRESTLERS
TO MAKE APPEARANCE

Davidson’s Wrestling prospects for the
coming year are encouraging. Six of the
seven members of last year’s team have re-
turned, while among the Freshmen are sev-
eral men who have had training along these
lines.

Captain Cromartie announces that the
mats will be in good shape in a few days, and
training will start immediately. It would be
to the advantage of any new men, aspirants
of the team, to see him at once.

The only match so far confirmed is with
Trinity, at Durham, Februray 23. This
match is the last of a double, contract with
this college. The past season Trinity’s con-
tenders met Davidson’s representatives on
the Hill, and the former returned victorious
by the close margin of two points,

Interest is being manifested, and as a re-
sult efforts are being made to bring a team
here this season. Negotiations with Virginia
Military Institute and Washington and Lee

University are expected to culminate in| |]'

matches at Davidson.

DAVIDSON FIVE
YEARS AGO

“Red and Black” Plays A. & E.
in Raleigh

Davidson meets her first contender for the
State championship next Saturday when she
plays A. & E. at Raleigh. It is hard to form
an exact estimate of the strength of the two
teams this early in the season. Each have
played only one game. Coach Fetzer’s war-
riors are ready for the fray, and after an-
other week of practice, the Red and Black
machine should be in shape to repeat the feat
of last year.

One interesting fact about the contest is
that Jack Black’s brother will be found play-
ing ‘left end for the A; & E. This is his
first year of collegiate football.

Tennis Tournament Began on

Monday
Eight teams in doubles, 27 enter singles.

NAVY DEFEATS DAVIDSON
IN OPENING GAME

Flowers Makes 70-Yard Run for
Davidson’s Touchdown

In the opening game of the season, in
which both teams showed lack of condition,
Davidson was defeated by the Navy eleven
at Annapolis on Saturday by the score of 27
The game began promptly at 2:30,
Navy receiving the kick-off. They were held
for downs and punted. Davidson was also
unable to gain, and an exchange of punts
followed in which Grey clearly had the bet-
ter of his opponent. Davidson was mainly
on the defensive and near the end of the
period the Navy registered three touch-
downs.

The second quarter was much faster,
neither side scoring. ‘The last half was fea-
tured by a 70-yard run around left end by
Flowers, which resulted in Davidson’s only
touchdown, This run, with the defensive
work of Burns and the punting of Grey
were the features of the game from the
Davidson standpoint.

The Washington Herald contained the fol-
lowing account:

“The Carolinians fought a dogged game
all the way, but it easily became apparent
that the Navy offensive was much more
powerful.”

ALUMNI!

Were you at Davidson in ’07 when the
Wildcats frocked V.-P. I.,.12 to 5? Or were
you parked here in ’10 or ’17 when the Vir-
ginians just managed to pull through by the
margin of a cat’s meow? If you were we
know you'll be back for Home-Coming Day.
If you weren't, come back and see what hap-
pens when these fighting teams get together.
The “Battle of the Century” was fought
over a year ago in Boyle’s Thirty Acres,
but the Battle of the Year will be pulled off
on Sprunt Field on October 21. Come back
and enjoy “the thrill that comes once in a
lifetime.”

About 500 students missed the best scrim-
mage of the year last Monday. Only a few
witnessed the affair that lasted for an hour
and a quarter. The two teams battled up and
down the field, and when the dust had cleared
away the varsity led, 12-0, Davis and Martin
scoring the markers. More fight was shown
than has been seen on Sprunt Field all year.
