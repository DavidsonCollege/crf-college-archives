You Know You Are Virile

Remember Freshman
Camp? That now departed
weekend at. beautiful Camp
- Thandérbird? For me it was
a pretty traumatic experi-
ence in two ways.
first, I learned that no
matter what you had done
in high school, there was al-
ways some guy at Freshman
Camp who made 300 points
better than you on SAT,
was president of more clubs,
played more sports, was ac-
cepted at better schools, and
had an 8x10 glossy of a bet-
_ ter looking chick than. you

did.

I don’t care. if you were
the greatest thing to hit your
high school since hall moni-
tors, there was always some
guy you were sure to meet
at camp who was greater —
and quite willing to tell you
so,

The second traumatic thing
about \F.C. was the bull ses-
sions with the hall counse-
lors. The question always
came up, ‘‘How often’ do
you date?’’ The hall counse-
lor in my group was pro-
bably the guy who three

years ago was the teeshman.

Nobody was greater than.

You know, ODK, new GTO,
the whole business.

Resting one: sockless Wee-
jun on the bottom bunk, Mr.
Joe College confessed,
“Well, I have been on cam-
pus without “a date a few
weekends in the past three
years.

and three term papers due
on (Monday."’

I hated that guy every
Saturday night I sat in my
room, staring DIAOY, at the

New Nicholls Preduction
Kecreates Milton Epic

A REVIEW
With ‘Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?,"’ ‘The

Graduate’’ and now. ‘‘Catch
22"' to his credit, Mike Ni-
chols -has virtually cement-
ed his hold on the title of
Hollywood's most successful
adapter of literary works
for the screen.

Whatever slight reserva-
tions about this judgment
may have been entertained
before, however, will be
swept away on seeing Ni-
choll’s latest masterpiece, a
masterful cinematic retelling
of John Milton’s epic poem,
‘Paradise Lost.’ :

Published in 1667, ‘‘Para-
dise Lost’ is the story of
Adam, the first man, and
his wife Eve, the first. wo-
man, who were expelled
from their home, The Gar-
den :of Eden, by God, the
_ Creator of the Universe.

Interwoven with their story
is that of Satan, who was
banished from heaven by
God and who motivates
much of the action.

Nicholls himself ‘admits
that the work presents pro-
blems in the adaptation.
“This work presents pro-
blems in the adaptation,’’ he
told tan interviewer in some
obscure news magazine
whose name I can't recall,
and I admit it.

“For one thing, almost all
of the action in the book is
related in dialogue, or rath-
er monologues, by one char-
acter or another. We wasted
about four months on loca-
tion filming these passages
verbatim and it wasn’t un-
til we saw the rushes back
at the studio that | realized
how static a two hour close-
up of one character speak-
ing might be.”

At this point Nicholls de-
cided to call in his long-

B.C

a ed

time associate, Buck Henry
(who, also plays the voice of
God in the film), and _ to-
gether they sought to sal-
vage the script. ‘‘And not a
moment “too soon,’’ says
Henry derisively..,When I
came in, Mike was thinking
Milton got his plot from
‘Holinshed's Chronicles.’ "’

Some traces of these early
intentions can still be «seen
in “‘Paradise Lost'’ --- not-
ably the forty-five minute
segment in which Michael
(played by Jack Nicholson)
reveals to Adam (Richard
Benjamin) the entire history
of the World from the fall
to the birth of Christ — but
except for this pause the
manic, frenzied pace of the
action never slackens.

The cdsting is with one
exception, extremely good
throughout. The one excep-
tion, unfortunately, is in a
central role, that of E ve.
Candice Bergen’s icy soph-
istication which has served
her so well in previous
films, is worse than wasted
on this occasion.

Only David ‘'Hemming's
virtuoso performance as The
Serpent saves the crucial
temptation scene from laps-
ing over into face. (How did
they ever get his skin that
shade of green, anyway?)

Amid “the general excel-
lence of the minor roles
Dustin Hoffman's Abdiel
and Elliot Goulds'’s Beelzi-
bub. demand special notice,
though I feet that the script’s
characterization of the two
as low comedy yes-men to
God and Satan respectively
was overdrawn and in the
former ‘case *inappropriate.

Whoever thought of Ali
McGraw ‘and Ryan O'Neal
as Sin and Death. deserves
a medal. _

‘Richard Benjamin seems

the perfect Adam, once you
get used to his freckles and
a disconcerting habit of fal-
ling asleep during scenes.
And when Jack Nicholson’s
Michael reveals ‘‘To Adam
what shall come in future

days,’’ we see Milton at his
best.

But ‘Paradise Lost"
stands or fall on Satan, and

Donald Sutherland as_ the
lead has. given the Ameri-
can sereen what is probably
the greatest tour de force
characterization since What's
his name's “Citizen Kane."

The role is not an easy
one; by turns jealous, mali-
cious, proud, petulant, vin-
dictive, arrogant, . spiteful,
and unpleasant, Satan — is
Milton's most complete char
acter. :

Sutherland performs the
role with ease and natural-
ness; only a_ purist could
quibble with his occasional
tendency to improvise his
lines.

But final credit for the
production must go to Ni-
cholls. From the opening
frames of a solid black void
being disclosed in slow mo-

tion (a process that is re-

peated several times during
the film, usually during reel

' changes) to fhe final shot

of a large, unattractively
bound book being closed
with a contented sigh, Ni-
cholls does not remove his
eyes from his objective, not
even long enough to disclose
what that, objective is.

Nicholls has ulways been
a trend setter in films, and,
what with the upcoming re-
lease of such films as
“Catch Genesis 2’ and
“X*M*A*S,” this looks to be
only the start of a new wave
of cinematic attempts to
“justify the ways of - God
to men.”

Alumnus Praises
Student Initiative

To the Editor:

I wish to applaud the mar-
velous new social system at
Davidson which was pushed
by Ran Coble and the SGA.

It is inspiring to see young
men take the initiative in de-
ciding what kind of social
life they want on their cam
pus.

The orderly and cautious
fashion in which the students
proceeded to work for the
idea of ‘‘eating clubs” left
little for the trustees to do
except approve the final
proposal.

Credit must also’ be given
to the extensive reccommen-
dations’ of the Student Lick
Committee (SLC).

Their comparative studies
of similar social systems at
Bob Jones University, Par-
sons College, Lenoir Rhyne,

by Johnny. hart

{ws

wee Fie

‘and Cal Tech have, proved

invaluable.

One particular innovation
which I find particularly in-
genious was the use of a stu-
dent referendum to. give
credence to the SGA _ pro-
posals.

There could be little ques-
tion about the desirability of
the proposals’ after the stu
dents turned out en masse
to ballot for ‘eating clubs."’

After eating four years
myself at Klodberg’s Palace’
I would relish a chance to
go groupee with random
numbers like 4 or 38.

What could be fairer, and
to think that the Davidson
students did it all by them-
selves. No more of that in
loco parentis crap.

‘Now maybe the overwork-
ed College President Sam
Spencer can catch his
breath. Maybe even take a
trip somewhere, sdy Andora.
Or maybe he can take on an
extra helper to ease the work
load.

At least now Spencer can
concentrate on administra-
tive problems, ‘like the facul-
ty, and leave the social life
of the student body up to

‘the students. Love and kiss-
