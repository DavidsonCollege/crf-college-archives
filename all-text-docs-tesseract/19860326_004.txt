Wednesday, March 26, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Rusk scholars find Davidson wealthy, difficult

By KEITH FINCH

Some new faces have ap-
peared on campus this term.
That's nothing new. But there's
also a new accent wafting through
the air in these hallowed halls — a
British accent. It’s brought to us
by the Dean Rusk Scholars, seven
English students who have come
to Davidson to study throughout
spring term.

According to International
Student Adviser Paula Miller, the
Rusk Scholars program was
begun in 1977 in honor of David-
son graduate Dean Rusk °31, U.S.
Secretary of State from 1961 to
1969. Rusk was a Rhodes Scholar
at Oxford and wanted British stu-
dents to have a similar opportunity
to study in the United States. The

The scholars — (Susannah
Briski, Hero Boothroyd Brooks,
Camilla Ferard, Catherine Hogg.
Nicholas Botwood, Philip Hoult,
and Victor Nikolaidis) were each
selected on the basis of an essay
and an interview. They are cur-
rently living in dormitories on the
Davidson campus. Each is living
with an American roommate and
has been assigned a host family.

One aspect of Davidson life
which particularly impresses the
Rusk Scholars is the apparent af-
fluence of the college and its stu-
dents. “The relative scale of stu-

dent wealth is incredible,” said
Hoult. -

Other scholars agreed. “I'll
tell you one of the first things that
strikes you — Davidson is incred-
ibly wealthy.” said Hogg. “All the
facilities are so new; there are
phones in every room, ‘fridges in
rooms — it’s incredible. God
knows how many indoor tennis
courts there are in England, but
there surely aren't many. And
you've got one here.”

Differences between English
and American academic systems
are also readily apparent. For in-
stance, students at Davidson have
up to two years to select their
mayor field of study, while the En-
glish system is considerably dif-
ferent. Hogg said, “We're used to
going into the system in English
universities and taking no more
than one course. At the age of six-
teen we take “O° levels in many
different subjects. Those who
study for the *A° levels specialize
in only three subjects, and by the
time you get into the university
you're studying one subject. |
guess there are pros and cons to
both broad and specific educa-
tions.”

Ferard also
peculiarities of

mentioned
Davidson

academics; “Classes are quite
hard work. I was surprised how
hard. There tends to be more con-
tribution to and preparation for
class here, I think. There’s a lot of
emphasis in England on just lec-
ture.”

Hoult mentioned that most of

the Rusk scholars are taking ad-
vantage of a “free year” that
British students usually take be-
tween graduation from secondary
school and entry into college.
‘We have a whole year before en-
iering the university in which we
can do anything we like. Most of
us will be here in the United States
for six months, taking two or three

months for travelling. Air flights
are really cheap here right now —
you’re having something of a
price war, aren’t you?”

In the meantime, the Rusk
Scholars may very well find them-
selves assimilated into American
culture. “I’ve never eaten so many
hamburgers and pizzas in my
life!” said Hogg.

Lambert, Rudy recetve Watson Fellowships

By LAURA BATTEN

Two Davidson seniors, Anne
Lambert and Sayres Rudy, were
awarded the Watson Fellowships
for this year. These two will en-
gage in a year of independent
study and travel, an experience af-
forded yearly to only a select few
college graduates nationwide.

Lambert and Rudy have been
selected along with 70 other col-
lege seniors to pursue their par-
ticular fields of interest in the
countries of their choice. Lambert
will be travelling to Japan and
Rudy to the Middle East.

The Watson Fellowship origi-
nated in 1968 with the intention of
giving interested students the op-
portunity to explore and under-
stand a subject for which they
have particular concern. The
Foundation provides a grant of
$10,000 to each student for his or
her project. Students are selected
with regard to personal interest in
and commitment to their field of
study, as well as the originality
and feasibility of their proposal.

Because the program is highly
unstructured, Fellows are encour-
aged to approach their projects
with a large degree of indepen-
dence and flexibility. During the
course of study, the Fellows are
required to keep in close contact
with the Foundation, submitting
periodic reports and a final evalu-
ation of their year.

Lambert will fly on Sept. 7 to
Tokyo, where she plans to study
different aspects of the Japanese

theater. Lambert said that she has
a lifelong love of the theater, and
eventually plans to go to graduate
school, where she will pursue her
specific interest in theater produc-
tion and management. Lambert
was first compelled to try for the
Watson last summer when she
worked at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington, D.C.

While there she saw a great
many plays, including two pro-
ductions performed in the
Japanese Kabuki style, a form of
drama extremely popular in
Japan. Kabuki is a highly visual
drama, filled with complex tales
of love, passion, and tragedy. It is
performed solely by male actors,
who play the roles of both men
and women.

Lambert was fascinated by
this form of theater, and became
particularly curious about the sig-
nificance of the onnogata, the
male actors who play the parts of
women. Lambert is interested and
at the same time bothered by the
exclusion of women from the
Kabuki, and is especially con-
cerned that the Japanese women’s
movement has done very little to
protest their exclusion. “My pro-
posal reflects the two driving
forces in my life at present, theater
and feminism,” Lambert said.

Lambert plans to study in
depth the Kabuki theater and its

portrayal of women, and will also |

seek out a comparable women’s
theater, perhaps travelling to

Osaka, in order to contrast the. two
distinct styles of drama and to gain
better insight into the cultural role
of women in Japanese society.

Lambert said she is somewhat
apprehensive about the language
barrier she will encounter, al-
though she said she is eager to
learn Japanese. In addition, she
welcomes the change from or-
ganized, structured Davidson life
to a more flexible, “go with the
flow” lifestyle she will experience
next year. Lambert said; “I can’t
believe it. I’m going!”

Rudy is concerned with the
question of finding a homeland for
displaced Palestinians. Rudy is
particularly interested in better
understanding the Arab-Israeli
conflict. This is partly due to
growing up in Scarsdale, N.Y.,
said Rudy, where there is a sub-
stantial Jewish population and
thus the Arab-Israeli conflict has
always been a prominent issue. In
addition, Rudy spent last summer
doing an internship in the David-
son in Washington Summer Pro-
gram on U.S.-Soviet relations,
which fueled his interest in the
subject.

Rudy will be studying the var-
ious Palestinian groups which
have been displaced and are now
scattered throughout the Middle
East. The groups, while all con-
sider themselves to be Palesti-
nians, are quite diverse in many
important respects, including
levels of education, economic
status, and political opinions,

Rudy said. These differences are
significant, Rudy feels, when
studying the Palestinian issue,
which involves finding these var-
ied groups a homeland where they
are to be unified once again.

Rudy has chosen three major
areas to concentrate his study: the
West Bank, Amman (in Jordan)
and Kuwait. These regions are
representative of the diversity evi-
dent among the Palestinian
people. Rudy’s goal is “to under-
stand the situation, to witness it,
to get a feel for it, and to under-
stand and live amongst the Palesti-
nian people.”

Rudy is unsure of housing
plans at the moment, but is con-
sidering trying to live with Palesti-

mian families. He intends to study
Arabic before leaving, in order to
gain a basic understanding of the
language.

Sayres’ friends and family
have expressed concern about his
travelling to the Middle East,
which has been the scene of a high
degree of terrorism. Rudy re-
sponded to these concerns by say-
ing, “I think at this point, I feel as
safe going to the West Bank,
Amman, and Kuwait as I would
feel going to Paris, Rome, Vie-
nna, or New York City.”

Rudy is apprehensive about
the anti-American — sentiment
which prevails in much of the
Middle East, but sees it “simply as
a matter of planning carefully.”
