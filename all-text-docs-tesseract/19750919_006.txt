[Ed. note: This week begins a
five part Davidsonian series on
interesting and out of the way
homes of Davidson students.
The aim of the series is to make
such places as Novelty, Ohio
come alive for readers so that
if, in the future, they are asked
if they have ever been to one of
these feature towns, the reader
can say yes and fake it from
there.

What information there is in
these stories may tend toward
trivia. The point is that these
places have something to say to
people who are not acquainted
with them, and people who live
there are going to say it.]

Novelty, Ohio sits 30 miles east
of Cleveland on route 306 in the
northeastern area of the intense-
ly proud Geauga county and, at
the same time,nowhere in particu-
lar.

Novelty, Ohio is actually an

that encompasses the northern
half of the Russell township. -

d existence of Novelty

ships have been conglomerated
into places like Cleveland. With
16 townships, Ohio has only 11
post offices. Persons living in
northern Russell or Newbury re-
ceive their mail at the Novelty
post office.

Russell and Newbury don’t have

post offices. They pick up the.
mail at Novelty which turns out to
be only a mailing address. So
Novelty, Ohio doesn’t exist. An
example of oversight, shortsight
or poorsight in the land of Johnny
Appleseed!--Not quite.

The people of Geauga county,
historically proud Buckeyes be-
fore they even knew that that’s
what they were, don’t quite take
the non existence of Novelty as
humorously. Again, these are
intensely proud people.

Storytellers in Novelty will tell
about some persons from -border-
ing Cuyahoga County who were
forced to wade through troughs of
sheepdip before entering Geauga
and then repeat loudly three times
“You better believe it!’’ once in
Geauga they were welcomed to
what local boosters call ‘The
American part of the U.S.”

Novelty’s existence is strongly
supported by the Geaugans. They
point to the post office and its big
plate glass window which pro-
claims the words ‘‘United States
Post Office, Novelty,Ohio,44072”
by means of a posterboard sign
taped to the glass.

Bill Kiouda of the Klouda Sheet
Metal Works is sure Novelty
exists. He has painted ‘‘Novelty,
O.” on the sides of his sheet metal
trucks.

Apparently Geaugans just want
someone to admit that Novelty
exists. Like one child fighting
another, all the Geaugans want is
their opponents to cry ‘‘Uncle’’.

A major step toward placehood
for Novelty occurred a few years

_ago when parts of.a mastadon jaw

were found in a ‘peat bog in
northern Russell. The novelty of
the thing, if you will, put Novelty
on the map. (At least the maps of
museum curators.) A state road
map still makes no mention of the
place.

Novelty, Ohio was named, rumor
has it, because of the enormous
Telling Belle Vernon dairy farm
which existed at the turn of the
century. The huge cattle barns
and tile silos were considered so
odd in 1900, that literally thou-
sands, most from Cleveland, trav
elled to see the novelty. Novelty
got its name from the tourist
attraction. Still no one knows

exactly who the tei belle was.

Novelty has no real industry
except Bill Klouda’s metal works,
but it is clean and populated by
almost twenty-five thousand peo-
ple. It doesn’t quite live up to its
motto: ‘‘A countryside with urban
pride’’, but it does exist.
