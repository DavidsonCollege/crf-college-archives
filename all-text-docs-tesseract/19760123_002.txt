No one knows why

Vending machines removed

By LYMAN COLLINS
Assistant News Editor

Vending machines to sell

soft drinks and candy were
once located in each dorm.

Now only Little, Watts, Belk,
and Richardson have mach-
ines.

“I did not realize that there
were not machines in all the
dorms,” explained manager of
the student store Peter Nich-
olls, who also manages the
vending machines, ‘‘however,
I will look into it.” ~

“IT can only assume that
they have been removed to-be
repaired ‘and will be returned

eventually,’’ he continued.

There have been no
machines in those dorms all
this year.

This week the soft drink

machine in Belk was removed,
leaving only the machines in
Little, Richardson, and Watts
to serve the entire campus. °

‘“‘The machine in Belk, I
know was removed because it
was out of order and will be
returned, but possibly not
until spring term,’’ said
Nicholls.

“Vandalism is also a prob-
lem with the machines, I’m
afraid,’’ observed Nicholls.

“‘On the one in Belk we were
losing more than $30 a week,

almost as much as we were .

taking in.”

“Still there is a great deal of_

profit with the machines and
many people use them,’’ he
said.

When asked why there were

no vending machines in the

Union, Nicholls indicated that
machines would eventually be
placed there.

“Union director C. Shaw

Smith has not decided where. —

to place the machines. We’re
waiting on his decision,’’ he
concluded.

Church proceeding tabled,
Maloney drops prosecution

By PAUL SCHLEIFER
Staff Writer

Professor of Religion Sam-
uel D. Maloney had been
acting as prosecutor for the
Presbyterian Church in the
United States (PCUS), Pres-
bytery of Concord against Dr.
C. Gregg Singer since mid-
October of 1975 in a rare
judicial proceeding that was
tabled early this week.

The official charge against
Singer, former member of
Franklin Presbyterian Church
‘in Salisbury, and now a
member of the Maulpen
Avenue Church in the same
city, was ‘‘disturbing the
peace”’ of the PCUS. Charges

-also included deceiving and
demoralizing the minister,
distributing separatist litera-
ture, and urging separation at
Franklin from the PCUS to
the Presbyterian Church in
America (PCA).

Maloney, a member of the
PCUS, was appointed upon
the recommendation of James
T. Frazier, Pastor of St.
Andrew’s Church in Winston-
Salem, N.C., and was accept-
ed by a Concord Presbyterian
Special Committee assembled
to prepare the case. Proceed-
ings were cut short by Dr.
Singer’s announcement that
he had transferred from the
PCUS to the Associate
Reformed Presbyterian
Church. ;

Before the announcement
Maloney said in an open letter,
‘‘My position as prosecutor
will be to work for a clear,
unbiased and _ equitable
presentation of the evidence
before a Presbytery-appointed
Judicial Commission.”’

Punishments that could
have been handed down by the
Judicial Commission would
have been admonishment,
denial of the sacraments,
removal from his office as a
church elder, or excommunica-
tion. According to Maloney,
excommunication was only a

slight possibility.
According to Maloney, the
charges stemmed from

Singer’s attempt to influence
Franklin Church, Back Street
Church of Mount Ulla and
Immanuel Church of China
Grove to change from the
PCUS to the PCA. Nearly 100
members of Immanuel did
change and formed the New
Hope Church.

The seriousness of the
offense was due in part to
Singer’s position as a church
elder and his vow to, in
Maloney’s words, ‘preserve
the peace and unity of the
church.”

According to Maloney,
excommunication is reserved
for persons with serious moral
problems and heretics. “Dr.
Singer’s religious views are
not challenged,’’ said Malo-

‘ney, adding that Singer was
not a heretic.

Maloney held that the
charge was not serious enough
to have made excommunica-
tion probable. He expressed
some relief at the abrupt
dismissal of the case.

Women singers form chorus

By AMANDA HALL
Asst. Sports Editor

Davidson women have
formed a chorus to give wo-
men singers a chance to per-
form with a group and to
create an outlet for their
unused talent.

A brainchild of Sara Deck,
the group consists of about 25
women, some who were All
State chorus members in high
school, or who have sung in
musicals, and some with no
performing experience. Exper-
ience was not emphasized
during recruitment.

‘“‘T came to Davidson in
September and began asking
about being able to sing with
an organized group. I thought
a lot of good talent was going
to waste here,’’ Deck said.

After determining the amount
of interest on campus, Deck
contacted Chairman of the
Department of Music Dr.
Donald B. Plott, who sug-
gested that Pat Morris, a
music major, direct the wo-
men.

“I was interested in doing
an independent study on cho-
ral conducting, so Dr. Plott
suggested that I take over the
chorus to get some experi-
ence,’’ said Morris.

Debbie Jo Bumgarner ac-
companies the group on piano
and o/ficers will be elected
within the next few weeks.

While the group, still in the
planning stage, has held only
two rehearsals, Morris hopes
for a perfomance next term..

The women are working
with traditional women’s cho-

ral music, sacred or patriotic
songs, instead of popular
pieces or show tunes. Their
present library is small, con-
taining only the music left
from when the Queen’s College
chorus sang with the David-
son Male Chorus.

“When I organized the cho-
rus I had in mind something
distinctive the women could
do, something they could call
theirs and be proud of. Where
we go from here depends on
the interest of the women, the
support of the students, and
the leadership we have,” said
Deck.

“We are still in the forma-
tive stages and would really
like the support of the women.
This is our organization and
we did it ourselves. It’s a good
group,” she continued.
