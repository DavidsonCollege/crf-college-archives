‘Kittens Topple ECU, Furman
With Tough Defensive Efforts

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

This is the Age of Aquarius,
where harmony and understand-
ing are abounding.

After a lackluster
Davidson Wildkittens have fi
nally realized that, and their
basketball workshect after three
games stands 2-1.

In their opening contest
against Clemson, the 'Kittens
were plagued by a lack of har-
mony and understanding and
fell to the Cubs 109-87.

A major reason for the de-
feat is that the ‘Kittens were
simply not used to working as
a unit.

“We were real nervous, and
that plus the fact that Clemson
has a damn_ good were
big factors,” explained coach

They lost to the Charlotte
Soccer Club 31. Bill Vaughn
scored the only Wildcat goal.

Levan said that scheduling
was very incomplete at this
time, but that the club would
be plaving the Charlotte Soccer
Club and the Concord High
School Team within three weeks
after the Christinas break.

The Davidson rugby club has
just finished its fall season.
The team completed the season
with a 2-4 record, ending with
a 31-12 blitz of the Charlotte
rugby club. Davidson let at the
half by a 25-0 score. Sam Up-
church, Tom McKenzie, and
Billy Mohr, among others spark
ed the win.

Zack Mobley, head of — the
club, spoke optimistically of the
coming spring season. The teain
will play South Carolina, Duke.

son, and the James River rug-
by club. Mobley also mentioned
that the Duke VII Tournament
and the Tulane Madri Gras
Tournament were — possibilities.
Except for the tourneys, only
the Duke game is an away
game.

Mobley cited several reasons
for being optimistic about fac-
ing the tough schedule. “We

Duncan. Postma.

The ‘Kittens were really
roughed around by the hulking
front line of the Cubs, and they
were victimized by the outstand-
ing play of Doug Lowe, who
bombed the nets for 30 points.

Larry Horowitz took scoring
honors for the 'Kittens with 24:

The second game saw the
‘Kittens employ a_ full-court
pressure defense to topple East
Carolina 69-66.

Offensively the ‘Kittens could
not score enough to enjoy a
comfortable margin, according
to Postina. “Our defense won
that one for us,’’ he commented.

mented, ‘because several inem

“Due to the number of home
games we have on our schedule,
L think our record will be sign
ificantly better than our record
was this season.”

ker were the pacesetters for
the ‘Kittens with 31 and 18
points respectively.

The ‘Kittens were able to
overcome a 28-point perform-
ance by huge 7-1 Fessor Leon-
ard to subdue the Baby Pal-
adins.

Dunn was here, there and
everywhere all night, making
fast break layups and hitting
shots from all angles.

Despite the high-scoring out-
come, Postma again credited
the defensive play of the ‘Kit
tens as a key to victory. ‘I
would say that defense is our
strongest point at this stage of
the season,” he noted.

The starting lineup has been
relatively stable so far. The
four scholarship players, Horo-
witz, Dunn, Parker and Jim
Lowry, are playing well together
and they are developing into a
harmonious unit.

Forward Craig Crosswhite has
been the fifth starter, with the
exception of the Furman game
when Mike Whalen started.
Whalen’s quickness made a big
difference in the effectiveness
of the pressure defense.

When Postma and coach Jim
Larranaga have turned to their
bench, they have found several
capable replacements in Joe
Duncan, a fine all-around play-
er; Jud Cuttino, an excellent
outside shooter, and reliable
point man Tim Spencer.
