You are getting very

sleepy: Hypnotist
entrances campus

By MatTTHEW HossBiE
Guest Writer

Saturday night, nearly a fourth
of the student body crowded into
the 900 Room of the College Union
to witness the magic of hypnotism.
Actually, Chip Flatow, the hypno-
tist, used his introduction to dispel
the idea that hypnotism is sorcery
and instead just a focusing and free-
ing of the mind. He explained that
intelligent people are the best sub-
jects for hypnotists because they
are open to new ideas and have
vivid imaginations. Obviously,
Davidson was the right place for
him to be!

After half an hour of stand up
comedy to get the audience to “think
laterally,” Chip invited volunteers
to storm the stage. While he spoke,
his subjects soon fell under the
power of suggestion. Throughout
the show participants each became
involved in crazy hijinx that ranged
from believing that they were on a
beach to thinking that their shoe
could talk. A sophomore, led to
believe she was Madonna, headed
up a musical performance of “Like
a Virgin” along with her self-ap-
pointed band. A freshman lost the
knowledge of the number six. When
she missed the number while count-

ing, the others, entranced, greeted
her with jeers and strange behavior
at the suggestion of the hypnotist.
Flatow compelled another sopho-
more to be a pathological liar and
also showed an imaginary movie.
Students, on and off stage, danced,
sang, and had a great time.

Were the students really hyp-
notized? Junior Jenny Nolan said
that she always felt that she had the
power to choose what she wanted to
do, but just chose what the hypno-
tist said to choose. Senior Billy
Roberts said that when the hypno-
tist told them that his clothes were
gone, he didn’t actually see him
naked, but reacted as if he were
anyway. Obviously, some were
deeply entranced as they laughed
hysterically one minute and sobbed
uncontrollably the next.

Above all, hypnosis was por-
trayed as a great way to free the
spirit from stifling inhibitions.
Flatow even gave the participants a
chance to improve themselves at
the end of the show, so hopefully
those on stage are better people
through the experience. Thanks to
the sponsors, the F-CREW (Fresh-
man Can Run Everything Well),
Committee of the Union Board and
its leader, Billy Roberts, for a great
show!

For all you 21-year-olds, the
day has finally arrived and not a
minute too soon.

The 900 Room Bar will offi-
cially open its doors tonight at 10
p.m. for the first “21-Year Old
Night” of the school year.

On “21-Year-Old Night” you
MUST have 2 forms of identifica-
tion to get in, a Davidson ID and a
valid license, passport‘or military
ID.

If you don’t have your
Davidson ID you can write your
name, ID number, and date on an
index card that is put into “The
Box.” Thitallows you to enter the
900 Room without your ID on that
visit. . ,
However, the next time you
come you MUST have your ID to
get in because no one with their
name already in

Those who use “The Box” can
enter without their ID. But don’t
fret. It isn’t a one-strike-and-
you’re-out deal. The next time you
come back with your ID, just tell
| the door person that your name was
in “The Box” on your last visit and
they will remove it. Easy.

So why do you have to have a

Tonight’s the night: 21-year-old night debuts

Davidson ID and a valid “of age”
ID every time?

The 900 Room Bar is run by
the College on College property in
aroom that isn’t always licensed to
serve alcohol.

For this reason, we have dif-
ferent licenses to run the 900 Room
different ways depending on the
event.

For events with alcohol, the
room is run like a private club.
Your Davidson ID is symbolic of
your, membership to this club and
has to be presented every time.
You must always have your valid
ID showing you are “of age” be-
cause it is North Carolina law. On
nights when alcohol is being served
and it isn’t “21-Year-Old Night,”
students who aren’t 21 can enter
but they will be stamped “No” so
the bartenders know who they can
and who they can’t serve.

What it all boils down to is, if
you are 21 and you want to drink at
the 900 Room Bar remember: you
need a DC ID AND a drivers
license, passport or military ID.
Do this and all will be cool! Get
excited for a chill year in a fun bar
environment. Hey, we’re even
going to try out selling food at “21-
Year-Old Night” for something a
little different...
