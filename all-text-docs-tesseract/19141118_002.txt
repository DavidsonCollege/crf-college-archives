EDITORIAL.

THE GAMECOCK GAME,

The game with South Carolina last] t
Saturday brings Davidson to the near-
end of a splendid season, Only one game
has been lost, and that to the big ‘Tar-
heels. Davidson has run up a total of
2§7 points to her opponents’ 35. It
would be hard to find a season for many
years past that shows a better record.

The game with Wake Forest remains
to he played, and comparative scores
would give the fighting Red and Black
Machine a slight edge. It is true that
Wake Forest held North Carolina to a
12-7 score last Saturday, showing sur-
prising and greatly increased strength.
North Carolina used nothing but
straight foot ball, however, while Home-
wood, Tandy, and Tayloe, whose work
was so diastrous to Davidson, were out
of the game.

It will be a great game and well
worth seeing. The Baptitsts will fi ght
us hard. Thev are having mass. “pep’
meetings daily, and their slogan is “On
to Charlotte—Beat. Davidson.”

TILE REPORTERS’ STAFF.

Relow the editorial staff this week
will be seen the names of the men clect-
ed to the new Reporters’ Staff. The
competition for places on this staff was
opened two months ago, and out of the
twenty who entered it, the above were
chosen hy the Editorial Staff at the last
meeting.  Promptness in covering as-

signments, general stvle and neatness in| -

writing, and adherence to newspaper
rules, were all taken into consideration.
Tt is to be understood, however, that the
Reporters’ Staff is open all the vear till
the first of April. Any of those who
were rot elected this time may still try
for places during the next few months,
as well as others who have nat competed
before this. “The new members on the
Editorial Staff for 1915-1916 will be
chosen from the Reporters’ Staff only.
We congratulate the successful con-
testants fer reporters’ position, but wish
to remind the new men that the same
standard of work will be required. of
them, and a reporter will be dropped at
any time who becomes inattentive to as-
signments or careless in his work.

FAW RESIGNS.

J. E

- On account of other pressing duties,
including the management of the An-
nual, J. FE. Faw handed in his resigna-
tion to Tie Davinsonran Staff at the
last meeting. This was accepted, but
the Staff expressed its regret of the
necessity for it, and its appreciation of
the faithful and excellent work which
Faw has done for the paper. He has
written some of the very~ best articles
this year.

STATE SPIRIT.

Now that dormitory spirit, has waned.
the new fad seems to be State Spirit,!
but it is one which should become per-
manent. The men of the various States
represented here are organizing into
clubs, and nearly every one has had its
banquet or “feed.” While social in na-

ture, the meetings have been earnest. in
purpose. The slogan of nearly every
club is “Double Our State Constituency

Next Year.” It is a splendid thing, this
State Spirit, and should bear rich fruit.

DAVIDSON AND HORNER.

The Horner foot ball cadets visited
Davidson last Saturday, and Davidson
men were delighted with them. © They
proved to be a clean, manly set, and true
sportsmen. Although they were defeat-
ed by the Scrubs, yet they put up a fine
fight, twice holding on their five-yard
‘ine. The team contains some very
promising material.

Horner is the nearest Preparatory

{School to Davidson and should furnish

Davidson with many good men in the
ears to come. And Davidson men
hould do all in their power to further
increase the mutual good feeling and
brotherliness between the two institu-
tions.

THE GUILFORDIAN,

We welcome with pleasure to the
table of North Carolina college weeklies
the first few issues of “The Guilford-
ian,” now being published by the stu-
dents of Guilford College. It is a cred-
itable and interesting sheet, and will no
doubt become one of the leading col-
lege newspapers of the Carolinas. We
congratulate the editorial staff on the
enterprising way in which they have
begun. Nothing so binds students and
alumni together and helps to mould stu-
dent opinion as the college weekly.

We would venture to suggest, how-
ever, that for the sake of the appearance
of the paper and newspaper “etiquette”
that the headlines be made more even and
attractive. and that the editorial “we”
be used only in the editorials.

There are now four college newspa-
ners in the State, “The North Carolina
Tarheel.” “The Trinity Chronicle,”
PHe Davipsontan,” and now “The
Guilfordian.”. The number could well
be increased.

“The Guilfordian” has the distinction
of being the only college paper in the
Carolinas edited by a lady. Miss Kath-
ryn Dorsett is editor-in-chief. Best
wishes!
