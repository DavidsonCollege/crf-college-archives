students on other campuses.

According to Durden, several
changes should: be made to

readjust the focus of The Da-

vidsonian toward students.

First, Durden said student
specialists should write more
nized as specialists when they
write. Readers can understand
the particular view of the writer
when they know the writer's
credentials,. Durden said.

Second, Durden said The Da-
vidsonian should be more ob-
jective and more respectable
rather than sensational. ‘“There

is enough interesting stuff go-

Third, Durden said The Da-

PCC Proposal

‘The Patterson Court Council unanimously approved a proposal
to fine students $40 for leaving their eating houses during the
academic year.

PCC Chairman Jeff Harris explained that the fine is necessary to
ensure the financial stability of eating houses and on-campus
fraternities.

He said it is ‘ ‘essential to the economic survival of Patterson
Court.” —MARK BARRETT

India Program

The faculty, in its meeting last Tuesday, voted to extend
eligibility for the semester in India program to rising sophomores.

The program was previously open only to rising juniors, but a
_lack of interest has precipitated this move by the faculty. Religion
Professor Robert Kaylor stated, ‘‘If we get about four or five more
applicants there is a real possibility the program could go.”’

Kaylor, who is coordinating the program at Davidson, noted
that several freshmen had approached him, expressing an interest
in the program. He hopes that there are enough freshmen
interested to fill the remaining spots.

Davidson has been awarded a federal grant which would
essentially cover the travel expenses incurred by the program.

A minimum number of students is needed, however, because all
‘off-campus study programs are required to be self-supporting.
Kaylor mentioned that the India program needs at least fifteen
participants to be. self-supporting.

With the Federal grant, the cost would be around $2,300 for the
program.

While in India, the students would attend Madras University
and be enrolled in a course covering many facts of the Indian
culture, learn the Tamil language, and endeavor a guided reanereh
project.

Davidson students would earn four ungraded course credits for
0 Ped in the program, which spans approximately sixteen

"UNCC is participating with Davidson in this program,
administered by the Indian government and Madras University.

Dan White, a member of the UNCC religion department. will
accompany both schools’ participants to India. No Davidson
professor will be accompanying the group.

Kaylor pointed out that if the College fails to enroll
enough students in the program the chancés of being awarded
another federal grant for the following year would considerably
diminish. Without the federal grant, the program would cost
around $3,400 per participant.

Applications are now available from Kaylor, who invites any
interested students to stop by and see him. —PETE HUX
SGA Committee Appointments

The Student Government Association has made its first round of
appointments to, campus committees.

In their meeting Tuesday, the Senate appointed John
Willingham and David Sappenfield to the Media Board, which has
general administrative authority over all student publication.

‘Ed Goode, Karen Hester, David Hoke, and Al Rhyne will be the
hew members of the Council on Campus and Religious Life. This
committee is concerned with the overall quality of student life at

minds open,” and to insist on
consistency in writing.

She emphasized that the Edi-
tor “should encourage a better
rapport with the faculty. The
Davidsonian should pull faculty
and students together with
more faculty input,’’ Durden
said.

Waddell has worked for The
Davidsonian since the fall of his
freshman year. He served as
Assistant Sports Editor and
Co-Sports Editor before becom-
ing Managing Editor last
spring. He was recently ap-

‘pointed Production Coordina-

tor.

Waddell has worked exten-
sively in the area of productions
and photography and is cur-
rently working on Hobart's
Park.

Waddell said The Davidson-
ian is. ‘‘continuing to build a
competent staff. We have espe-
cially strong freshmen and jun-
ior involvement this year. In

the fall we will work to get more
involvement: from next year ’s
junior and freshmen classes.‘

As Editor, he plans to make
“no major innovations’ " because
“the staff needs to feel stable,

which has been a problem in the

past. I'm interested in promot-
ing this stability. Working for
The Davidsonian will be more
fun and the quality of the work
will improve once stability and
organization are established.”
he added.

He said The Davidsonian is

“an outlet for the community"
and it should serve to ‘inform,
entertain, and keep the people
aware of not only their commu.
nity but of the issues in the
outside world as well. "' "

Waddell said he would like to
see College Press Service stories
continue to be published. He
said CPS stories are valuable in
“rounding out the paper" since
they add both a national and
international aspect to the
paper.

As Editor, Waddell plans to
work to boost subscriptions.
‘This would require only a little
extra effort,”’ he said.

Waddell said the Editor must
serve as a ‘‘funnel” for the staff.
He stated that the Editor needs
to “keep his ears open to the
students, faculty, and adminis-
tration” since he is a ‘‘spokes-
man for the paper and campus.”
He said the Editor should “keep
tabs" on the editors and writers
to be sure they do their jobs.

_ system, Hughes said that it

would cost a further $40,000 to
$50,000 to set up a 4 man
dispatch service.”

Hughes explained that when
the college set us an indepen-
dent security system a year
ago, the campus police decided
to continue to use the town’s
dispatcher. Not to do so would
have required the replacement
of all emergency phones and
walkie talkies.

Hughes added that ‘‘This
campus is not big enough to
sustain a 4 man dispatch ser-
vice.”

Following last Wednesday's
incidents, the campus police
spoke to Cannon Hall Counsel-
lors Tuesday. In order to make
the present dispatch system
efficient, the campus police said
“if such an event occurs, find a
friend, and call immediately.
Either give explicit details, or
else ask the dispatcher to send
the campus police car to the
place.”’ They stressed that the
caller “‘give a name and callback
number.’’

They added that girls should
not walk around campus alone
at night and should carry a
whistle, or even some weapon
such as a hat-pin or bunch of
keys. In the event of an attack
girls should scream, bite, kick
and scratch -- and run, the
campus police said.

They asked students to re-
port any harrassment, or even
loitering on campus by non-

The campus police warned
that ‘‘every time a student
picks up a red phone for a joke it
weakens the system.”

In response to questions a-
bout freshmen women living in

pus police said they will inves-
tigate the need for new lights.”

At the moment, however, the
crucial issue is how the dis-
