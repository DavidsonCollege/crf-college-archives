Man’s Responsibility to
Posterity is “Y” Subject
Professor Fleagle Gives Striking

Presentation of Important
Subject.

Man’s personal responsibility to his
posterity proved to be an interesting
subject for discussion at the “Y” service
last Sunday. Prof. F. K. Fleagle com-
petently discussed this subject by draw-
ing lessons from four family histories.
The generally accepted theory that
person is at liberty to do what he pleas
provided willing to take the
consequences of his actions on himself
was shattered,

The first family discussed the
Jukes, descended from a restless, worth-

a

born in New York in 1720, Among his
twelve hundred descendants, none of
whom had even a common school ed-
ucation, were 310 professional paupers,
60 thieves, and seventy murderers. Dur-
ing 150 years they cost the state of New
York $1,250,000.

In contrast with this record is that of
Jonathan Edwards, born in New Eng-
land in 1703 of high parentage, who be-
came a missionary and president
Princeton, Of fourteen hundred

285 were college grad-
thirteen college presidents, one
hundred clergymen, one hundred law-
yers, sixty authors, three senators, and
one U, S. vice-president.

Lest the difference in the  environ-
ments of these two families be given as
the reason for such records, the history
of two branches of the Kallikak family
were given as follows:

82 Deaths in Infancy 13
3 Criminals 0)

Such facts as the above unquestionably
prove that everyone is not only respon-
sible to himself for his actions, but that
it is impossible to avoid the responsi-
bility to his descendants. i

The talk was thoroughly enjoyable and
beneficial to all who heard it. This was
the first time Professor Fheagle has ad-
dressed the “Y,” but it is strongly hoped
that it will not be his last time.

The service was in charge of Mac
Richards. As usual, the musical side of
the program was excellent. The
quartet, Sorrels, Allison, Buchanan, and
Crane, impressively sang “My Son, Give
Me Thy Heart.”
