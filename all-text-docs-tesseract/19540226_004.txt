Capable Bob C
Meets Chapel P

By DICK MOREHEAD

The Y's answer to the chapel
riddle is senior Bob Cruteh-
field, native of Orangeburg,
South Caroline, and this year’s
chairman of the Chapel Com-
mittee for the Y.

Although not previously
connected with this phase of
Y work, Bob hes always been
interested in its activities and
the general nature of the
chapel period. Through his
careful planning and leader-
ship, the ¥ has developed suc-
cessfully sound and sincere de-
votional programs through the
yeor.

Capable “Crutch” is a his-
tory honors major,with eyes set
on theological seminary upon
graduation. Although claiming
to have lost more elections
than William Jennings Bryan,
he has elways been active in
campus affairs. A member of
the Student Council for two
years, he is this year pledge
trainer for the Sigma Chi
social fraternity, officer of the
Mate Chorus, and member of
such honorary organizations
as Alpha Psi Omega, Red and
Black Masquers, Le Cercle
Francais, and Sigma Upsiton.
Having progressed through of-
ficial ranks of the renowned
Philanthropic Literary Society,
he served the society as its
president for the first semes-
ter of this schoo! year.

The Chapel Committee
‘The functions of the Chapel
Committee may be divided into
three realms of activity: first, it
has sole jurisdiction over the
Thursday chapel programs; second-
ly, it serves as a non-voting repre-
sentative on the Executive Chapel
Committee; and lastly, it takes
charge of various programs, usual-
ly on a voluntary attendance basis,
such as chapels held during the

frustrating periods of exams.

BOB CRUTCHFIELD

The main emphasis of the
Thursday chapel services is on
worship, worship of a meaningful
and carefully planned nature in
contrast to the other weekly
chapels which may range from
power politics and pulverized
philosophy to mission appeals. The
Thursday programs for the ‘first
semester have included a foreign
student and a local student who
had travelled extensively abroad;
special emphasis such as the Gift
Fund; to missionaries who spoke
to the student body in an inspira-
tiohal and instructive manner; and
worship services conducted and
planned by students.

The worship services were usual-
ly held between the times when
a speaker was brought in, and for
the most part, were short services
aimed at creating within the in-
dividual students an attitude of
genuine worship. :

The selection of leaders for the
Thursday chapel programs is based
on two primary criteria: one, the
person should have some experi-
ence and insight into conducting a
worship service; and secondly, he
must have something to say to
the student body. He is not chosen

15 to Mr. Andersson, Hall of Grad-
uate Studies, Yale.

Tulane University

The Tulane University Graduate

ground for future politicians. Their
debates are wide-reported and
often broadcast and are second in
interest only to those in Parlia-
ment.

Recently Hubert heard Lady
Astor, a Virginian and a great
favorite in England, speak at the
Conservative Association. After
her talk which she  wittily
described as “absolutely the worst
I’ve ever listened to,” she and Hu-
bert exchanged greetings in long,
Southern drawls.

When Hubert entered Davidson
in 1949 he, like every other fresh-
man, was required to speak to
every person he met on the cam-
pus. But in Oxford, like in British
railway compartments, it is con-
sidered bad form to speak to a

avoid conflicts which put the players in seemingly unneces-

sary and definitely unfair position.

What we're driving at is that a definite schedule for the
other two dance weekends similar to the one for Homecoming
should be worked out. Homecoming has already been an-
nounced and the various sports that are in season during that
period are either not scheduled for that weekend or are at
least scheduled to be at home. If that advance notice 6f dance
weekend dates would be issued for the other dances, con-
flicts with sports events could be avoided.

The IFC would loose its “cat and mouse”—‘“hide and|

Ara announcements, but would give some of the Wildcat ath-
letics a better chance in some of their competition and also
would avoid some of these men having to miss part or most of
a weekend because of athletic trips.

roblems

“from one particular group as

evidenced by the fact that the
student leaders thus far have
ranged from pre-law and business
majors to pre-ministerials.

The majority of the committee
work for these programs is on an
individual effort and achievement
basis. The chairman first suggests
a topic to the leader well in ad-
vance of the proposed program;
then the leader draws up an out-
line and plans his talk. Before the
program, however, Chairman
Crutchfield meets again with the
leader, hears the proposed pro-
gram, and adds such criticism and
aids as he feels necessary to stay
within and further the aims set
by the committee.

The committee had charge of the
chapel exercises during the late
lamented examination period.
These programs were of such a
nature as to lend themselves to a
continuity of thought and expres-
sion. They were held at 8:15 each
morning in the Lingle Chapel, and
were led by student and faculty
members, using each morning the
same order of service. The main
idea was to provide an atmosphere
in which students could have their
individual devotions in the com-
pany of others of like mind, and
as such the services were quite
successful.

The Chapel Committee is close-
ly integrated with other Y com-
mittees, often serving as a
channel for important projects
such as the Gift Fund and the Fo-
rum. Plans for the second semes-
ter will be completed soon, and
suggestions from the student body
are not only welcome but appre-
ciated and carefully considered.

Asked for his opinion on chapel
conduct, Chairman Crutchfield
said that the student body has
done its full part, attention has
been better, and consequently he
feels that more have profited from
the devotional programs.

stranger without a good reason.
For a few weeks conversation with
Englishmen was limited to re-
marks like “Pass the salt, please,”
and “Thank you.” This reserve,
however, is not practiced solely on
foreigners for the British treat
their own countrymen in the same
way. But eventually they get
accustomed to seeing unfamiliar
faces around and British reserve
becomes a thing of the past.

When he returns to the United
States in 1955 Hubert plans to en-
ter law school. His two years at
Oxford will have taught him much
about how others live and he him-
self will have helped fulfill
Rhodes’ noble aim.

ville Bus Company, the First Bap-
tist Church has arranged for a
bus to leave Davidson from the
regular bus stop, on Sunday, at

would like to use this service can
do so by stopping the bus at their

In the individual scoring depart-
ment for the Wildcats, Hobby Cobb
continues to be the leader. Cobb
has moved far out in front of his
nearest competitors, and the Char-
lotte flash is also getting his
share of the rebounds. Hobby re-
cently received honorable mention
on the All-State team of the Char-
lotte Observer. He has scored a
total of 318 points in twenty games
this season, for an average of 15.9

Held by ROTC Cadets

At a voluntary gathering in the
Green Room of the Student Union
the M.S. II and IV students along
with four officers of the ROTC
Department held the second of
four informal smokers. Refresh-
ments were served, and the stu-
dents discussed with each other
and the officers present the ques-
tions they had concerning phases
of the ROTC. program which class
time did not allow. The smokers
are sponsored by the ROTC De-
partment for this purpose and also
to enable the students and officers
to get to know each other better.

Approximately fifty per cent of
the advanced military students at-
tended the meeting and joined
in the discussion. The MS IV ca-
dets had questions concerning pay
and allowances, uniforms, small
unit leadership, code and conduct
of the officer corps, how to report
to a new station, and qualifications
for parachute school.

The main interest of the military
three students was the army sum-
mer school they will have to attend
for six weeks of this summer.

The discussions do not have any
guided leadership but are carried
on in a conversational mood with
students raising questions and who-
ever is able providing an answer.

Captains Hatch, Terrell, Brown,
and Lieutenant Lamar, the mili-
tary instrutors present, felt the
meeting was worthwhile and are
looking forward to the next one,
the date of which will be an-
nounced.

One of the most important fac-
