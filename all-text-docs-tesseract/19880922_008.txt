defense mechanism your body uses to
eliminate toxins.

Marijuana suppresses’ this defense
mechanism and the alcohol continues to be
absorbed into the bloodstream. Your liver
is doing its best to keep you from poisoning
yourself, but it can do so at only a half-
ounce of alcohol per hour. The rest is up to
you.

Dear Confidential Health,
Does drinking really interfere- with
studying?

Yes, it appears to counteract the hard
work and long hours you may have put in.
Alcohol interferes with the manufacture of
protein in the brain. This may affect mem-
ory, which is an important factor in learn-
ing. In addition, some researchers believe
that blackouts may be an extreme example
of short-term memory loss. An example of

a blackout follows: the last thing you re-
member is that you were at a party and now
you find yourself in a stranger’s driveway
in your car. You don’t remember driving
there, but the scary fact is that you did
manage fo drive. Your short-term memory
was temporarily lost.

State dependent learning can also occur

with alcohol. If you have a long-term asso-

ciation of drinking alcohol while studying,
this may lead to the need for the same
alcohol high in order to feel like you can

recall the information during an exam.

Despite the initial effect of stimulation,
alcohol may give you, it actually is a de-
pressant and can lead to reduced motiva-
tion. ;

It seems clear that if your goal is to learn
and memorize information, then alcohol is
not the beverage of choice.
