Baseball and football—Hughes knows them both

By ISMAT HUSAIN
What others say:

Mikio Aoki: “dynamic to the
point of being a pain in the
butt.”
Rob Eenhoorn: “a good idiot”
Tim Weaver: “you can’t de-
scribe him in one word or
phrase.”
Paul Byrne: “he’s so wicked
cool.”
Harry Schiavi: “a great athlete
who is a legend... in his own
mind.”
Asst. baseball coach Stuart:
“he’s intangible... never ceases
to amaze me in
thought or actions.”

What the stat sheet says

At Boston College High
School, Hughes was all-State,
and team and conference MVP
in both football and baseball.

At Davidson, he has started
four years on the baseball team
and four years as quarterback
of the football team. He is the
only NCAA athlete, other than
Denver Broncos’ quarterback

John Elway, ever to hit a home
run and throw a touchdown
pass as a true freshman.

During his junior year, he led
the Colonial League in passing,
throwing for 1,054 yards. He
passed for 987 yards in this, his
senior campaign, despite a
nagging hand injury.

On the diamond, he had 49
hits, 7 homers and 49 RBIs asa
sophomore and, as team cap-
tain this season, presently
leads the Wildcats in RBIs.

As for future plans, Hughes’
goal is to be a football coach.
However, he would like to play
baseball for a few more years,
perhaps in the European Pro
League where he played last
summer. Assistant football
coach Guarini had this to say
about Hughes: “Pete was
thrown into the fire way too
early his freshman year and
had to fight back his sopho-
more year. He’s a fighter with
great confidence. Having him
on the field was like having an
extra coach because he always

knew what to do. Pete has ab-
solutely nothing to be ashamed
about, and if there is anyone to
blame it should be the
coaches.” Said baseball coach
Jim Stoeckel, “He has a great
personality and has a knack to
make everyone around him
feel comfortable. He is a great
hitter, has a good arm, and you
will definitely get to see him
pitch this season.”

Davidsonian: How did you
end upat Davidson? Comment
on your first year.

Hughes: I liked coach Vic
Gatto, and he was the main
reason I came. I was very sur-
prised and disappointed at the
very little student and faculty
support in athletics. I wanted
to transfer freshman year.

Davidsonian: Comment on
being the football quarterback
at Davidson.

Hughes: ] always thought that

the hardest job in America was
being the Davidson College
quarterback, because all
people see are the wins and
losses. Because of the position I
played, people pointed the fin-
ger at me. We were playing
against teams that gave out
football scholarships, that out-
weighed us by 70 pounds... we
were being outtackled, and
when we finally got to a level
where we could compete with
them... the college dropped us
to Division III. I was very dis-
appointed because everyone's
effort in the last few years was
washed down the drain.

Davidsonian: Why did you
play again this year?

Hughes: Starting my freshman
year and taking a lot of the heat
made me grow up faster and a
stronger person. I began to play
formyself and my teammates. I
learned to deal with negatives
positively, and when ‘coach
Gatto asked me to play, I said

yes.
Davidsonian: Comment on
baseball. °

Hughes: I never had any pres-
sure playing baseball and
didn’t have to worry about the
program being dropped if we
didn’t win. Even’ though I
didn’t play much last year after
a hand injury, my teammates
voted me captain. People don’t
realize that Davidson is only a
notch away from being a big-
time Division I baseball team.
We have a great, team, and
expect to win 35 to 40 games.

Davidsonian: Would you doit
all over again?

Hughes: Inspite of all the nega-
tives, I wouldn’t trade my
Davidson career for anything.
It has made me a better person
and I have made. lifelong
friends with my teammates
despite any win/loss records

‘in any sport.

HOOPS, from page 10

‘Cats failed to score during the opening
3:30. Harris provided five quality min-
utes, though, including a blocked shot
and a forced jump ball, before giving
way to Musch.

Musch greeted Liberty by scoring on
his first offensive possession, and his
jumphook capped a 12-0 run that gave
Davidson a 12-5 lead.

The Wildcats continued their domi-
nation with suffocating man to man
defense and occasional full-court pres-
sure,and Denmond’s jumper with 3:40
left gave them their widest margin at28-
17. Hunter’s foul line jumper gave the
‘Cats a 30-22 halftime lead.

But Liberty victimized Davidson

with a 22-5 tear to open the second
stanza, capped by a twenty-five foot
three-pointer to beat the shot clock and
give the Flames a 44-35 lead. The ‘Cats
scratched to stay close, though; 7 con-
secutive points by the Musch-Man and
a Jay Schmitt tap-in comprised a9-O run
to put the Wildcats in front, 50-49.

And then Bailey Alston, a senior aver-
aging 25.1 points, took over. His jumper
returned the lead to Liberty, but P.D.
answered with a three-pointer to place
the ‘Cats ahead 53-51 with 1:31 to play.
Alston’s trifecta 19 seconds later gave
the Flames a 54-53 lead, but Musch’s
jumphook with :45 left gave Davidsona
55-54 lead.

Alston then drilled a three-point goal
from well beyond the line, and Liberty
led 57-55 with :25 remaining. Hunter

then pushed the ball up the left side and
shot a 12-footer.
He retrieved his own miss but could

not get the ball to fall, and though:
Strickland nearly stole a pass on the
ensuing Liberty possession, the ball °

trickled away and time ran out. When

- the smoke cleared, Alston had scored

his team’s final eight points to pilfer the
victory.
Musch and Denmond paced the
‘Cats with 17 points each.
When questioned, Coach McKillop
demonstrated nothing but whole-
hearted approval of Hunter’s final two

shots, but admitted that the drought at

the beginning of the second half hurt the
‘Cats.

said, and cannot afford to waste several
