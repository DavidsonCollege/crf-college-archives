DEBATING TEAMS WERE

ership; (2) government ownership has
proven unsuccessful wherever tried; (3)
government ownership would not solve
our problem,

Win. Love, speaking for the affirma-
tive, brought out the points: (1) some
form of co-operation or combination is
necessary; second, it should be the form
most beneficial to the people; third, that
form is government ownership; because
(1) present system is not the most effi-
cient and beneficial because of the evils
of unjust discrimination, cumbersome
management, and uncontrolled labor;
(2) government ownership will be more
efficient and beneficial than present sys-
tem; because (a) it will remedy the
evils, and (b) it will unite the nation
industrially.

The next speaker, W. M. Currie, ad-
vanced the following arguments for the
negative: (1) government ownership
and operation is unAmerican; (2) it is
impractical; (1) a representative gov-
ernment cannot manage the business eff-
ciently; (2) government ownership
would be hampered by politics.

G. C. Bellingrath closed the debate
for the affirmative. His points were:
first, that private ownership is a failure,
hecause it is a burden to national de-

velopment; second, government ownecr-
ship will succeed (1) because it will give
monopoly control of a natural monopoly ;
(2) it will obtain capital necessary for
efficient development.

‘The debate closed with the speech of
J. L. Fowle. The argument was con-
cluded with the following points: Gov-
ernment ownership will increase the na-
tional debt. It will increase citizens’
taxes by 50 per cent; government can-
not operate the roads as efficiently as pri-
vaté concerns; government ownership is
an infringement on private rights; the

present railroad system is the most efh-
cient in the world. Mr. Fowle stated
that two-thirds of the railroads of the
world are owned and operated by private
individuals.

‘The speeches were clear, concise and

forceful. he arguments were well de-
veloped and delivered in a compelling
way.
A second debate ensued among the
judges in their endeavor to select the
winners. ‘Vheir final decision was that
Messrs. ‘Mhames, Cousar, Bellingrath,
Woods and Fowle should compose the
two intercollegiate teams, with Messrs.
Cumming and Knight as alternates.

It was decided that the team to de-
hate LaFavette in Greensboro will be
composed of J. A. Thames, J. 1. Fowle
and J. R. Woods. C. G. Bellingrath
and R, W. Cousar will debate Roanoke

OLD QUERY RESIDENCE
ON FIRE SATURDAY

The monotony of the mid-winter Da-
vidson life was broken about 12 o'clock
last Saturday morning by the genuine
shouts of “Fire.”
almost the whole student body were on
the scene of action which happened to be
the old Query residence, situated im-
mediately south of the town cemetery.
and now occupied by the family of Mr.
Robert Hager.

‘lhe fire started from a lamp that the
children, contrary to orders in the home.
had lighted in their play room. Some
overhanging towels or pieces of cloth be-
came ignited and with the blaze ever en-
larging the fire threatened to gain such
headway as to be beyond control. The
students with several town men soon
put it out, however, by pulling off the
shingles at the rear of the house and ad-
ministering freely the water which was
handed them from below. The pulling
off of the roof and tearing off of some
of the sheeting constituted practically all
of the damage. Mrs. Hager, who has
been ill for some time, suffered a violent
shock from the excitement and_ fright.
Were it not for the college boys the
house would without doubt have been
destroyed. The house was owned by
Mr. M. H. Caldwell, of Concord.

OUR WAR AIMS.

“An evident principle runs thru the
whole program | have outlined. It is
the principles of justice to all peoples and
nationalities, and their right to live on
equal terms of liberty and safety with
one another, whether they be strong or
weak. Unless this principle be made its
foundation no part of the structure of in-
ternational justice can stand. The peo-
ple of the United States could act upon
no other principle; and to the vindica-
tion of this principle they are ready to
devote their lives, their honor, and every-
thing that they possess. The moral
climax of this. the culminating and final
war for human liberty, has come, and
they are ready to put their own strength,
their own highest purpose, their own in-
tegrity and devotion to the test.”—From
Pregdent Wilson's Address, January 8.
1918.
