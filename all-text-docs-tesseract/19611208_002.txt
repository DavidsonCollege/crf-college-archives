North Of Main, East Of New York

In recommendimg the abolish-
Ment of the faculty rule prohititing
drinking by any student attending an
off-campus event sponsored in whole
or in part by the college, the Student
Council has reflected what seems to
be the consensus of student! opinion
and what is certainly common sense.

The problem involved is not what
heverage students use to quench their
thirst while attending a conference
hundreds of miles fram Davidson,
North Carolina. but how their conduct
reflects on Davidson College. Every
student should be mode aware of his
responsibility to represent the colicge
well. If he violates this responsibility.
he should be punished. The general
rule regarding gentlemanly conduct |s
stiffidient to this purpose and does hot
involve the vomplicated questions of
the enforvemont of the rile, its yuris-
diction, and its busic justice—ques-
tions which the faeulty probably could
net clarify even if it shoul try-

announced this week, beransc of a
desire for a “croative” issue, Fhal is
prohably the best Christinas gift the
erstwiile titerary-homior magazine
could give us during ihis season of

The expensive pain inflicted on
ihe campus fo. ihe past fw years in
the form of a magazine has been hor-
rible ta endure. Finally we are being
spared.

Editor Jackson won last spring

magazine with no apolegies. The only
question was whether he could come

Evidently he eauldn't. At least

Amendment Merits

Those of us who are sentors re-
member the discussion that was still
cing on our freshman year over the
eval of a student in the dormitories.
as a result of an accident with a rifle.

Since the passage of the amend-
ment te the Constitutian prohibiting
firearms in the dorms, the Student
Council hus tied to relegate all
weapons to the gun room in the baze-
ment of Belk.

They have been unsuccessful.
Students complained of a lack of
space, and decried the anavailability
of their weapons for hunting trips.
Storing guns in fraternity houses has
followed ted often, and the Student
Council is 10 be commended far sound
proposals to eliminate this hazardous
practice.

ures streamlined, no student has an
excuse for keeping a Tile anvwhere

the locked trunk of his car.

The recommendation also rpre-

As one of the council mombers
pointed out al the meeting Wednes-
day night, this problem presents an
opportunity for the council to fulfitl
its function with pusitive action.

The council bes not always attacked
the problems with which it was faced
so seriously a3 it has in Ubis instance.
In redefining the “campus” as the
area north of Main and east of Cen-
cord, they not only shirked their re-
sponsibility, confused the enforcement
af college regulations. and widened
the disturbing dichotomy between
Student Counal] and faculty regula-
tions. but they did not eves consult
the factity ot Honor Court in doing so.

Student Council members have
expressed the hope that this potltion
to the faculty may be indicative of o
new trend toward a more active ane

Underachievment Issue

BY OR. W, O, PUCKETT

(€dlter’s Note: This is the first of a sories of articles
to be published in THE DAVIDSONIAN on the subject of

underachiavement.)

Several years ago, in a Chapel talk, I pointed out the
fact that one of the major problems current in the David-
son student body is that of undarachievoment—one's not
utilizing the opportunity of getting the must out of his

college experience.

In so doing, the student ig chenting himself, the
College and society in general. Too many young people
are, and will be, clamoring for an education, for us to
afford the luxury of having a bunch of underachiovers in
our midst. On this, and many other college campuses,
a C is still a fashionable grade for a bright young man,
whase pursuil of fun overrules his search far knowledge.

Some colleges, notably Amherst, have emborked on
® program of unloading their loofers by giving them a
year’s leave of absence, If in tho opinion of the College,
they ore aot working up to thelr axpected potential.

deserving and achieving students should ba givan this
type of assistance, not the underachievers.

I} would like to see more done about the underachiev-
ars on the Davidson campus. Too many of us are not
giving Mt our best and need to be shaken out of sur
lethargy. We have a good number of underachievars. 1
have a few in my classes and [ would be happy to see them

move oul.

There seems to be a number of reasons why some
students want to “short-change” themselves in this mat-
ter of education. Let's look for several possible explana-

tions.

1. Possibly some of us shoutd not be in college in the
first place. Tao many people may be going to college in
order to please their parents, to make « national frater-
nity or to make the proper soctal contacts. These simply
do noi have the proper motivation to make the best of

the college situa’

2. A fair number of underachievers are studonic
“who have it made.” There is no necessity for making
more than the “gentiaman’s C.” A fob awaits tham In the
family business. Why do more than get by?

3. A number

us, I fear, are capitalizing on the
