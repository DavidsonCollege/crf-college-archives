Dorm crowdin¢ 3

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Asst. News Editor

“... Davidson is a residential
college, i.e., all students are
required to live in college resi-
dence halls unless officially ex-
cused, "’ — 1976-77 Catalog

The seven residence halls
house approximately four of
the students at Davidson.
Over 300 people live in other
facilities, ranging from nearby
perimeter housing to apart-
ments and houses if David-
son, Cornelius, and at Lake
Norman. aaa

With almost 300 of its
students living away from
residence halls, can Davidson
truthfully call itself a residen-
tial college?

“TI believe that it can,’’ says
College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr.

“The college-owned perime-
ter housing is certainly close
enough to be called ‘on cam-

us.’ Add those rooms to the

residence halls’ total,-and you

will find that less than 200 are
living off-campus—almost all
of them by their own choice,”
said Spencer.

Director of Student Hous-
ing Scotty Nicholls doubts
that the perimeter facilities are
truly on-campus.

“The houses on the edge of

‘campus and across the street
are removed from the main-
stream,’’ Nicholls said.

“TI think the College should
get out of the business of
perimeter housing for stud-
ents.’

Nicholls has in recent years
been called upon to squeeze
more students into Davidson’s
crowded living facilities.

The process has been one of
piecemeal additions— another
renovated townhouse opens a
dozen spaces, the basement of

Carnegie House is remodeled:

and 10 students move in, #6
Jackson Court is reworked to
hold four more—these are
examples of recent efforts to
make room for students.

Proposed Dorm
Nicholls has in mind a
solution that will end the
student housing crunch and
will bring more students back
on campus to live.

“It’s not my decision, of |

course, but my wish is that the
College would build a new
dormitory, along the lines of
the one proposed in 1972.”

Four years ago, the College
brought in a famous architect
to design a dormitory.

Plans were drawn and sket-

ches of the proposed building

were made. The dorm, housing
200, was multi-level, low and
rambling, with provisions for

smaller unit living and more’

common use areas (lounges,
kitckens, etc.). Construction
costs were estimated at 2
million dollars.

“The price was too high,”’
said Spencer.

‘*To pay for the construc-
tion, we would have been
forced to raise rental rates
$1000 per student.”

Nicholls proposes that costs
to the student could be de-
frayed by opening the new
building in the summer to
revenue-collecting educational
conferences and academic pro-
grams like the July Experi-
ence.

Another factor counting
against the dorm was the
“move off-campus” trend of
the late sixties and early
seventies.

‘‘In the spring of 1971 we
had to deny many requests
that students made to live
off-campus,’’ said Dean of
Students Will Terry.

“If they’d all been allowed
to move off, many dorm rooms
would have been empty. The
move-off trend has reversed
now, but no one knows if it

_ will recur,’ said Terry.
‘‘There was a time,’’ Nic-
holls commented; ‘‘when mo-

ving off-campus meant gain-
_ing>more freedom. I don’t
think that’s true now.

“There would be enough
students to fill a new dorm if it
were built,’’ she said.

HIGH BUILDING costs prevented this dormitory from

becoming a reality.

Housing Ignored

Spencer confirmed that im-
proved hoising is not listed as
a priority in the College’s
sequicentennial development
program.

Nicholls admitted that she
was ‘‘very disappointed that

housing was not mentioned as

“a priority .”’

“If someone wants to give.
us the money to build a new
dorm, we would certainly do
so,” said Spencer.

The College will not, how-
ever, actively seek such funds.

be on the board because of a
conflict of interest,’’ he said.
“But then no one really knows
the make-up and operation of
a publication except the edi-
tor.”

He did say that when the
appointments were made the
board would probably consist
of some ‘‘qualified newspaper
people.”

Baskin said he hoped the
board would be in operation in
time for the coming election
but he was somewhat con-
cerned because of a shortage of

time. The faculty has to elect
one member for the board, and
they don’t meet again until
November.

He did indicate that if the
board was not in operation by
the election the present Publi-
cations Board, which consists

-of all present editors, would

serve in the interim. =
“The student media board is
a good compromise, a good
way of satisfying all the needs
of the community—the legal
needs of the college and the
freedom of press for stu-
dents,’’ Baskin concluded.
