FRIDAY, MARCH 4, 1966

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

Superhorse And Co.

We are accustomed to leaving the
commentaries on sports to our sports
staff and to their usual weekly spread
in THE DAVIDSONIAN.

However. winning the Southern
Conference Basketball Tournament
made. big history and headlines last
weekend and prompts a hearty con-
egratulatorv note in this column.

The 1966 version of the basket-
ball Wildeats. a-predominately sopho.
more-studded outfit led by a real “‘su-
perhorse.” was not supposed 10 equal
the nationally ranked teams of the
past. ‘wo wears. which had failed mis-
erab-in the regular-season fina‘e.

But to the surprise of many _ its
followers this vear’s.bunch more than
equaled the mos7 famous teams D--"7
son-has produced.

Dick Snyder. a ‘“superhorse
there ever was one and David ~-
greatest athlete: Phil Squier. the
team’s steadies: plaver and a real: °

sung hero: Rodney Knowles. a rangy
monster who is the team’s chief back-

tentially great player who can really

himself with his all-around good play.
compose onlv the first half of a great
squad of Wildcats.

Ronnie Stone. George Leight. Pinky
Hatcher. Cecil Clifton and Jim Hyder
complement the starters in more ways
than one.

The usual zest and pride that goes
with a championship was hidden this
week ‘in Davidson's traditional over-
bearing coolness.

But we betieve that the unemotion-
al air on Cambus was just the anticipa-
tion of greater things to come.

And the road to Philly is the big
hurdle now to the top.

Let's go. Wildcats:

Encouraging Signs

Two recent actions on the part of
fraternities at Davidson are just the
beginning of a new attitude which
these groups must assume in order to
justify their continued existence here.

We refer to the open houses after
Vespers and the cooperative buving
effort which. has all but been effected
among the 12 organizations.

Although the attendance was slim
at the three fraternitv houses which
entertained Sundav night. the future
is promising in developing an intellec-
tualiv stimulating atmosphere which
seems to be allergic to the way of life
on Patterson Court.

Even more encouraging in the fra-
ternities’ efforts to prove their worth
is the cooperative purchasing group
which has been formed under the
guiding hand of Tom Covington. as-
sistant dean of students and fraternity
liaison officer.

Instead of buving in small. individ-
ual units. the fraternities have or-
ganized on a wholesale scale to pur-
chase in volume quantities.

A new Interfraternitv Treasurers
Council has been organized which has
spearheaded’ the effort. The group.
headed bv Irvine Welling. has worked
all vear to get the idea off the ground
and hopes to realize-the workabilit' of

the plan before the end of the school
vear

Estimated savings on each frater-
nitv's board bill next vear will be near-
lv $1,000.

We look forward to seeing the sec-
ond half of the report of the Social
Life Evaluation Committee. which will
deal with the present role of fraterni-
ties on campus and what their future
role should be. :

It is significant that the committee
not only will examine closelv the
present contributions of the Greek
chapters but also will look to what
these social groups should be doing in
the vears ahead.

College fraternities throughout the

country are coming under close scru-
tiniation even more. particularlv with
the changing social patterns in Amer-
ica, Davidson is no exception.
We feel that the committee will
consider the two recent achievements
of the fraternities which should bene-
fit the entire college community.

Among its deliberations the com-
mittee will also realize what has not
been done..we trust. along with wh‘
must be done in future to assure each
student of the opportunity for a com-
Dlete social life

Because cf this verv- little has been
said ‘about the mature and sengible at.
titude which nas characterized the stu-
dent. body at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill during the re- |
cent developments concerning this
state's infamous Sdeaker Ban Law,

The time ‘has been ripe during the
past few frustrating months for a
Sponianeous. news-making demon-
stration spurred on by the short tem-
pers and shortsightedness of some
students.

Yet. the demure thinking of student
leaders at Carolina is definitely a
credit to the large majoritv of col-
lege students evervwhere. esveciallv

The latest chapter in an embar-
Tassing account for the state of North
Carolina was written this week. The
universit’s board of trustees granted
to the UNC administration final au-
thority in handling invitations and av-
pearances of individuals who would
have been barred under the original
speaker ban law.

We feel that the sensible actions of
the Carolina students while negotia-
tions were underway toward modifv-
ing the initial ban has made state of-
ficials and political figures more will-

ing to compromise on the issue

Later in the week nearly 100 fac.
ulty members subscribed to a sizable
advertisement in The Daily Tar Heel
to recognize the student department.

_The statement read: “The under.
ne members’ of the UNC faculty
press their approval. and apprecia-
tion for the encouraging manner in
which the students of the University
have assumed initiative and continu-

ing responsibility for the protection of

an essential part of American free-
dom. the freedom to speak.

“We hope that this mav serve as an
example to those who take their re-
sponsibility for the nourishment of

The stigma of the 1963 law and the
Joathsome hand of political interfer-
ence unfortunately still hangs over the
situation at Chapel Hill.

But the attitude and serious think-
ing of the student will stand long after
the muttering of old politicos. And in
this way the Carolina students have
held themselves up well.

Dear Editor:

We are quite concerned over
the spirit of much of the criti-
cism that has been leveled at
the Social Council recently. Ad-
mittedly. Midwinters was no-
where up to par. but this was
due. to a Jarge extent, to mat-
ters beyond the Council's con-
trol.

We fee} tha: the criticism ex-
pressed by Mr. Howard. Mr.
Marrow and others in Jast week's
DAVIDSONIAN appears rather
impulsive. Taese mien: evidently
know absolutely nothing about
the mechanics and complica-
tions inherent in the process of
booking.

For example. the “Four Tops.”
currenih: one of the most popu-
lar groups around. were. booked
in November for Sauirday niga:
of Midwinters: because of a
broad *‘rider clause’ waren v4
considered unacceptable. —

vised.

Their agent replied that this
would'be done as soon as pos-
sible and assured us our booking
was airtight. Then while the
agent was on vacation, the group
made other plans and the agent
was unable to produce. Then the
valuable time of the last two
weeks of January was spent idly
waiting because another agent
misinformed us as to the availa
blity of Dionne Warick.

Then with only two weeks 1.
Midwinters, Lloyd Price was the
best thing available in our price
range. This is. somewhat ty'p.ca!
of the type of complications one
can expect to encounter ‘n t>

unfortunate; any further excus-’

The criticism commonly heard
also tends to be a little selfish.
As a representative group of the
entire student body. the Social
Council feels a responsibility to
present a well balanced program
—one that has something to in
terest everyone and at the same
time can be popularly received.
Ir seems that too many students
think that because the Social
Council. does not always have
“something real bie’ tha’ ::

Economic aid to the Soviet Un-

The $30,000 is supposed to be
used by the Social Council to
produce a more‘ complete social
program.

This is in keeping with the
concept, initiated by a defensive
fraternity system last year in
which the IFC would relinquish
its social responsibility to a cam-
pus-wide organization. Behind
this concept was the desire for
a better social atmosphere at
Davidson through the providing
of more opportunity of social
expression.

The additional $12.000-is being
spent by the Council and the
Union in attemptirig to -realize
dhis noble goal. Some o! these

Though -ve. feel tha: the opin-
jons -expressed in. last week's
DAVIDSONIAX were unduly crit-
ical. we do believe that con-
structive criticism. can be quite
beneficial. The Social Council is
wide open. for any suggestions

will strengthen “the “‘traditional

that article.

As THE DAVIDSONIAN ar-

ticle stated. it is Director of Ad-

is primarily responsible for Da-

this program. He has been con-
nected with the project for more
than two years. and from the
beginning he has enjoyed the
warm support of the Davidson
administration.
Any “pushing” by Mr. White.
has been directed toward the es-
tablishment of an active and .
effective committee of faculty
members to. implement David-
son's involvement with Project

so ‘of the people of the town of

monev raising effort—if it has the support of every

Davidsonian.

Each student will be asked to turn in a list of
possible contributors who are neither parents of Da-
vidsonians or Davidson alumni. Personal letters and
challenge fund brochures will be mailed to these peo-
ple before Spring Break. During your Spring Break,
or during a weekend before June, you will be ex-
pected to go by to visit with this person, to tell him
personally what the College proposes to do with the
Ford Challenge Drive money.

Bil! White, national co-chairman of the Ford
Challenge Fund Drive, will address assembly on
Thursday, and will tell students some of the “hows”
of fund raising. In addition, descriptive and explana-
tory material will be made available to each student

solicitor.

Possible “friends” could be the little old lady
down the block, or your home town’s self-made man.
or your long lost Cousin Joe, as well as businesses.
foundations, and civic clubs.

If every student raised $100 for the college, our
effort would gain us $100,000, to be supplemented
by $40,000 in aid from the Ford foundation.

_ Gripers, here is your chance to stop simply com-
plaining about Davidson and to get out and actually

work to make the college a better place.

It is a

chance for all of us to insure the increasing value of
our Davidson diploma. There is nothing this school,
using money well spent, cannot accomplish.

Why don’t WE get out and help raise some of

this needed money?
