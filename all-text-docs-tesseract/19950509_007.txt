SEPARATED AT BIRTH...

John Williamson and Herb Jackson

John Clark and Albert Einstein

You took astronomy for your science, didn't you?

Taurus (April20, May 20): Since
the Sunis currently passing through
your birth sign and is opposed by
Jupiter, this should be an interest-
ing birthday. Your life may be-
come a bad Bugs Bunny rerun so
watch out for falling anvils and
pianos. Also, any frog singing
“Hello my darling” should be
avoided. As always, patience is
power and your going to need it.
Since Bugs is for kids, itis not very
likely that you will get much play.
But hold tight and personal satis-
faction will abound.

Gemini (May 21-June 20): You
may be feeling a little down these
days because no one is giving you
the credit you deserve, well you
can blame it on planetary discord.
Don’t worry, you are not being
followed by litttle men in green
suits. And your mother didn’t hire
a hit man to kill you off. You may
want to use a little extra Nair,
though. Summer is coming and

Well , it's good to stay updated

eventually you will have to put on
a bathing suit. If you are in an
embarrassing situation, like on the
25th, just admit you are gay and
get on with it.

Cancer (June 21-July 22): Your
high hopes of winning the KA Rose
was not in the stars. Most likely,
you will sit on your ass doing noth-
ing and complaining about how
much work you have. If your ex-
girlfriend calls, hang up. She is
screwing your best friend. As for
pets, it will become clear on the 7th
that you wanta gerbil. The planets

_ just don’t agree with you these

days.

Leo (July 23-August 22): Your
ruler, the Sun, was aspected by
Jupiter earlier this month, which
means someone is going to aspect
you. There IS a train at the end of
the tunnel. Those dreams about
water will only get better, but try to
hold it in.. There is no way to tell

when you might get a surprise
morning visitor. Your friend
Woody will probably be up in the
morning, too.

Virgo (August 23-September 22):
You are entitled to respect and
admiration and if you can’t get it
you can buy it. But that could land
you in jail so remember, ask if they
are acop first. As for friends, you
don’thave any. Onthe 17th, some-
one will give you a package. Take
it to the gatekeeper and he will
unwrap it. Just remember to dis-
card it after you are finished.

Libra (September 23-October
22): Financial troubles abound.
On the 13th you my have to just
beg. Try the corner of Main Street
and Concorde. During the solar
eclipse on the 10th it may be a
good time to admit to your parents
that you quit school. Perhaps they
mightexplain to you that you could
still afford a home if you didn’t

buy so many drugs.

Scorpio (October 23-November
21): You will be dealing with a
minor health problem for the first
part of May, but don’t worry, that,
dry, itching feeling will go away if
you drink a lot of. water. You
appear to be doing things the hard
way and unless you stop giving too
much attention to others you will
end up as dry as the Sahara Desert.
Take a break. Just talk for awhile.

Sagittarius (November 22-De-
cember 21): Jupiter, your ruling
planet, is a little pissed off at the
rest of the universe. This means
that everyone hates you. Give up.
Kurt Cobain didn’t have it as bad
as you do.

Capricorn (December 22-Janu-
ary 19): The planets are with you!
Despite your tendency to get
tangled up in a big mess these
days, you will find a new maid on

15th and boy is she hot. And since
she loves to clean, you get into all
the messes you want. Watch out
for people carrying big sticks, how-
ever. Remember your new woman
loves broom handles.

Aquarius (January 20-Febru-
ary 18): Have you noticed that
their is a lot of hair building up in
your drain. That means hair loss.
If you are a senior people probably
think you are about 30. Take off
your hat and take pride in your
head. Now they look alike.

Pisces (February 19-March20):
You will die on the 17th.

Aries (March21-April 19): Your
mother is so poor, I saw her walk-
ing down the street kicking a can,
and I said, “What you doin’?” She
said, “Movin’”
