Christenson
Runs for

Congress

By ROB VAUGHN ’86

Eric Christenson’s shoulder-length
blond hair frames wire-rimmed glasses
and a full beard. Faded blue jeans and a
tee-shirt clothe his body. Despite his un-
conventional appearance, Christenson
is running for Congress.

Christenson, an employee of the
Grey Student Union, is not overly con-
cerned about his appearance in the elec-
tion; he does not anticipate a victory.
Eric Christenson is a Libertarian, a
member of a party which believes in “a
truly free market economy, draft aboli-
tion, nuclear arms reduction, an imme-
diate 40 percent tax cut, and a 70 per-
cent military spending decrease,” he
says.

“I don’t really think I'll win, though
I'd be pleased if I did. We just want to
get a name for federal office as well as
local office that lends legitimacy to the
Libertarian Party. I’m not really run-
ning to get elected as much as to let peo-
ple know about the Libertarian Party.
We have a candidate in every district in
North Carolina,” says Christenson.

The election of the congressional
representative for the sixth district, in-
cluding Alamance, Guilford, and Da-
vidson Counties, takes place November
4.

Davidson
Initiates
Gifts-in-Kind
Program

Davidson College has undertaken
research into the potential for donations
of material and equipment from corpo-
rations. The project is supported in part
by a grant to Davidson from the Duke
Endowment.

“Gifts-in-kind,” as these donations
are called, are nothing new. Each year,
alumni give colleges items ranging from
art to automobiles because they are tax-
deductible. Sometimes, the items which
cannot be put to use are sold.

The uniqueness of the present pro-
ject is its focus on corporations rather
than individuals, the potential for coop-
erative effort by several Southern col-
leges, and the planned methods for dis-
posing of donated items.

“We're looking for anything of:

value—tand, buildings, equipment, or
vehicles,” said Jim Herring, consultant
for the program at Davidson College.

_ Other schools from every state east
of the Mississippi River and south of
Virginia are involved in the preliminary

-- esearch. They include William and

Mary, Warren Wilson, Meredith, Cok-
er, The Citadel, Furman, Queens, John-
son.C. ‘Smith, Southeastern Baptist
Seminary, Guilford, Wofford, Sewa-
nee, “Agnes Scott;~Mary Baldwin, Bel-

“mont Abbey, Ogelthorpe, Birmingham

Southern, Eckerd, Hampden-Sydney,
Washington and Lee, Berry, Springhill,

News Shorts

Millsaps, Lenoir-Rhyne, and Berea.

Once a college receives a gift, Her-
ring envisions three methods of han-
dling it. Something like laboratory
equipment or a car will be used directly.
Other items would be bartered with
another college if the second college
had a use for it and the receiver did not.
Third, the equipment, land, or material
might be sold for cash. .

The program will probably use out-
side professionals on a part-time basis.

“How is a college development of-
ficer going to know the value of chemi-
cal process equipment or how much a
material handling system is worth, or
where to sell it?” Herring asked. “Once
the program gets going, temporary con-
sultants can be employed to answer
those questions and find markets for the
material.”

The program comes at a time when
many firms are retooling and consoli-
dating operations. Surplus assets which

- may result can be donated to colleges,

helping promote corpofate service to
communities while at the same time
bringing tax benefits to the donors.

Housing
Shortage

Moderates

By ELODIE MCMILLAN ’86

Many Davidson students have ex-
pressed concern about a housing shor-
tage.

According to Housing Director Bill
Bolding, at least five sets of roommates
were on “the waiting list and could not
get aroom” at the beginning of the year,
and several were living in the lobbies of
Watts and Little. By now, however,
about half of these students have at-
tained rooms.

Mr. Bolding says that the Housing
Office and Admissions “work well to-
gether” and can usually precisely esti-
mate the number of incoming students.

He says that “part {of the housing
shortage] stems from the senior class,”
which has approximately 400 students,
as compared to an average of 350 stu-
dents in the other three classes.. The
freshman class was also underestimat-

ed, which resulted in a few triples in.

Bolding claims that. “the attrition
rate is going down; . . . more [students]
want on-campus housing than before,”
partially because of the poor economy
and also because more of the peripheral
housing is taken up by the faculty than

usual.

The College needs to house faculty,
he says, because “Davidson is its own
market.” The Davidson community
does not have much available real est-
ate, and it is very expensive. For stu-
dents, however, off-campus housing is
comparable in price to on-campus, ac-
cording to Bolding.

Bolding thinks that if Davidson has
a smaller student body next year, the
housing shortage will be lessened, but
that we will not know for sure until De-

cember or January what next year’s out-
look will be.
