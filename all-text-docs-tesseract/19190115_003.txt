MARSHAL FOCH.

An innocent little controversy has
arisen in certain small circles about the
ecclesiastical connection of Field Mar-
shal Foch. Some Roman Catholic pa-
pers claim him as a member of their
church and rather warmly resent any
hint to the contrary. Colonel Beattie,
a chaplain in the Canadian Overseas
Forces, on his return from the front, re-
cently stated in an address before the
Canadian Club, Vancouver, that Mar-
shal Foch is an elder in the Presbyte-
rian) Church of France. We cannot
vouch for the accuracy of this statement,
but we do not think Colonel Beattie
would make such a statement before a
body composed of intelligent men of all
denominations without knowing whereof
he was speaking. We. do not think the
church connection of Marshal Foch is
a matter to grow warm over. One thing
is certain, Protestant or Roman Cath-
olic, the great French General is a deep-
ly religious man-and a devout and hum-
ble Christian, and that is more than
saying that he is a. Presbyterian or a
Roman Catholic or a member of any
other church. Protestants and Catholics
alike may well claim Marshal Foch as
a noble example of our common Chris-
tian faith. He is too big a man for sec-
tarian limitations. He belongs to the
great brotherhood of believers who are
found in all the churches—Presbyterian
Witness, Toronto, Canada.

Literary Societies |)

IN THE PHILANTHROPIC.

At the first meeting of the Phi Society
several matters of importance were de-
cided. For one thing the Junior Society
was done away with and the new men
will be initiated directly into the Senior
Society,

It will be of interest to those contem-
plating joining the society this spring
to know that the initiation fee has been|
reduced from $5 to $3. This change was
made for this year only, so you had bet-
ter join at once.

The Phi Society is glad to have so
many of its old men return. President
R. D. Hall and First Critic W. ML.
Currie are back in their old offices.” ‘The
other officers for this term are:  Vice-
president, D. MI. Chalmers; ‘Treasurer,
A. L. Foscue: First Supervisor, A. L.
Currie: Second Supervisor, C. N. Mor-
rison. * The following men were elected
to take the places of some who did not
return: Secretary, J. W. Dunlap; Junior
Member of Debating Council, A. L.
Foscue; Janitor, C. N. Morrison.

The committee for new members will
visit the Freshmen this week. There are
going to be several contests for the
Freshmen and Sophomores this spring,
and in addition to these contests there
will be the usual essay and fiction con-
tests far which all members of the societs
are eligible. These, together with the
training in public speaking, are some of
the reasons for joining one of the literary
societies,

IN THE EUMENEAN.

The Eumenean Literary Society held
its first meeting on Saturday evening.
January it. The meeting was called to
order by the president and the following
elections took place: President, Emery
Flynn: Vice-President, R. R. Craig:
Secretary. J. R. Boul are, Jr.; Treas-
urer and Reviewer, S. Tr. McCloy. This
year there will be no Freshman Society,
but the new men will be initiated into
the Senior Society at an carly date. ‘The
next meeting of the society will be held
in the Eumenean Society hall at the reg-
ular time on Saturday. A canvass of
the dormitories for new men will be held
this week. and it is hoped that many new
men will avail themselves of this oppor-
tunity to join a good literary society.

TOWN ITEMS.

THE ORIGINAL HANDY MAN.

A colonel: wanted a man-servant, so
he inserted an advertisement in a local
weekly. One of the applicants who an-
swered was an Irishman.

“What I want,” explained the col-
onel, “is a useful man—one who can
cook, drive a motor, look after a pair of
horses, clean boots and windows, feed
poultry, milk the cow, and do a little
painting and paper-hanging.

“Excuse me, sor,” said Murph

, SOT, phy,
what kind of soil have ye here?”

“Soil?” snapped the colonel. ‘What's
that got to do with it?”

“Well, 1 thought if it was clay I
might make bricks in me spare time.”—
Everybody's.
