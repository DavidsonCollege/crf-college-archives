EDITORIAL.

Ie has been over a year now since
that) good ship, “Tun Davinsontan,
amid gloomy predictions as to her final
‘wreck and ruin, and enthusiastic wishes
for a safe and prosperous voyage, was
first launched on the troublous seas of
college life. And we feel that she has
made a prosperous voyage and that her
white sails have carried a goodly cargo
of interesting news trom pert to port.
During this year she has had fair and
foul weather, starins and calms, but al
wavs the sailors have felt that there were
men in port who had perfect confidence
in them and who were looking forward
with eagerness to the coming of their
ship. It is for this interest, trust and
co-operation on the part of our patrons
that we. the outgoing editorial staff of
The Davinsoniax, wish to rendes
thanks. We feel that what success this
paper las achieved -has not been due te
any one set of men, but to the face that
all Davidson has been behind us) from
the start.

And for this new editorial staff. this
new crew of sailors who are. to sail our
good ship for the coming vear, we would
ask that same spirit of trust and confi
dence which vou have shown us. “Phe
new. staff has been selected through it
competitive svstem. a system which in
sures 2 combination of experience and
ability in the men selected. “That “Pree
Davinsonian for the coming vear will
be an improvement over what it has
been for the past vear there is no doubt
in our minds. With a definite organi-
vation and an experienced staff. “Var
Davipsonian has.an assured success be-
fore i. We can only wish this new
stuff the most enjovable and prosperous
of vovages and assure them of our heart
iest co-operation with them in’ every
manner possible.

THAT ROCK THLL TRIP,

Do vou remember those terrible
numbing moments when you were first
called on to speak in society? You felt
your feet growing to ‘an enormous size
and vour cars forming a plane perpen-
dicular to that of your head. Electric
shudders twitched vour limbs, a lobster
red replaced the rose pink on vour cheek
and vour voice ranged anywhere from
ato high z. And oh, those cruel, thiose
critical eyes that stared from the adaman-
tine countenances of supercilious upper
classmen, those eves that drilled holes
through vou despite vour agonizcgl
squirming! Haven't you a great ad-
miration for men who have undergone
all these trials, who bv sheer force of
moral courage and determination have
hecome the representatives of our col-
lege? When it takes our debaters the
better part of a dav to trundle all those
reference hooks to their room in a wheel-
barrow, when it takes the whole of’ six

weeks to go through them and properly’ J

to say that they deserve just a
backing. Last fall we showed Clemson
that our college had the *nerve, the
brawn, the courage and the pep
drown the ‘Viger’, roar even while we
tied knots in his tail. Let us show Clein-
son this spring at Rock Hill that we
have a sufficient: quantity of brains, col-
lege spirit and “googeo eyes” to send the
‘Viger howling back again to his sylvan
solitude. We know that Alec and
Rhody have the brains and that the
Tiger is going to feel bad when they get
through with him. We know that you,
the students of Davidson, have the spirit

and can produce the  “googoos’’ and
" . '

“broaly” talk on occasion. Next Mon-

day is the proper time te shew your

spirit and your heart-smashing abilities
Advance to victory, lads, with thar glor-
ious refrain on your dips. “‘l hear you
calling me.”

NEW EDITORIAL STAFF
WILL ASSUMK OFFICE

The present staff of Tite Davinson-
IAN has been busy for the last week in
an attempt fo organize the paper. upon
a sound working for the new editorial
staff which it to take charge of * next
weck's paper. As a result of this a new
constitution has been adopted by the sraif
und new members have been clécte!.
Latta Law and ‘VT. D. Sparrow were
elected as ‘rising Senior members, and
R. OH. Ratchford. “T. J. Mitchell, and
PB. Price as rising Janior members of
the editorial staff. All of these men
are from the reporters’ staff. and their
election was based upon a strict competi-
tive system, “T. J. Mitchell was elected
by the staff as managing editor and P.
B. Po%e as assigoment. editor.

Oi Monday morning the two newly
elected rising Senior members of the
editorial staff, T. D. Sparrow and Latta
Law, together with J. P. Williams, the
assistant editor of the present staff, were
placed before the student body for the
purpose of electing the editor-in-chief of
the new staff. As a result J. PL Wu-
liams was elected. With his perfect

Ness managers, were recommended to the
student body, and as acresult of the vote
J. H. Carson was elected as the new
business manager. Heo will, however.

business manager to surrender his wark
in the middle of the term.
