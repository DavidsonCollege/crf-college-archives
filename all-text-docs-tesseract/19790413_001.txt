Davidson students, faculty join anti-nuclear demonstration

By JOHN SIMAN
Staff Writer

About fifty people from Dav-
idson participated in an anti-
nuclear demonstration Sunday
afternoon at the front gate of
the unfinished McGuire nuclear
plant six miles south of Corne-
lius.

A procession to the front gate
of the plant and several short
speeches, as well as a prayer for
the people of Harrisburg, Penn.
who recently witnessed a nuc-
lear accident, were some of the
activities last Sunday. The
crowd of over 200 people also
chanted anti-nuclear sayings
throughout the demonstration.

A Duke Power Company
official, Energy Services Super-
visor Mary Cartwright, des-
cribed the demonstration as
“extremely orderly.”

Suzy Yoder, the spokesman
for the Davidson Energy
Group, counted 215 demonstra-
tors, many of whom were
members of environmental
groups from Charlotte and
Asheville. The demonstrators
from Davidson included many
members of the Davidson Ener-
gy Group, professors and pro-
fessors’ families, about thirty
students, and several towns-
people.

Sophomore Geoff Little, who
co-heads the Davidson Energy
Group with Lilith Otey, was the
key figure in organizing David-
son’s participation in the dem-
onstration. Little and Yoder
said the demonstration as a
whole was organized by the
Charlotte Safe Energy Alliance
primarily as a reaction to the

recent accident$ at the Three
Mile Island nuclear plant near
Harrisburg, Penn.

Yoder was the only member
of the Davidson Energy Group
to address the demonstrators.
Her speech focused on five basic
objections to the McGuire
plant: the safety problems of
nuclear operation, the catas-
trophies that would result in the
event of major radiation leak-

age, the decline of_property -

values around the plant in the
event of any accident, the high
cost of nuclear power to the
consumer, and the problems of
storing nuclear waste.

Alex Coffin, Manager of
News Services for Duke Power,
said Wednesday that the dem-
onstrators made no objections
to nuclear power that have not
already been made by other
nuclear power opponents. Cof-
fin added, ‘‘We feel that nuclear
power is the safest and cleanest
source of energy.”

Yoder said the Three Mile
Island accidents confirmed
there are safety problems inher-
ent in nuclear power. Coffin felt
the fact no one was killed or
injured in the accidents proved
the general safety of nuclear
plants. —

Coffin added that in the wake
of Three Mile Island, Duke
Power is making a compre-
hensive evaluation of proce-
dures at all its nuclear sites. He
said the review of nuclear plants
conducted thus far has given
Duke Power no reason to alter
procedures anywhere.

Both Yoder and Little agreed
the goal of the demonstration

Erwin resigns editorship

By JIM GARRETT
News Editor

Davidsonian Editor Charles
Erwin submitted his resigna-
tion to the Media Board before
an open forum Monday because
of controversy surrounding a
faculty lampoon entitled A
Guide to Courses at Davidson.

Senior News Editor Dennis
McLawhorn and Features Edi-
tor,Ann Garner were appointed
co-editors by the Media Board
in consultation with The David-
sonian’s junior and senior edi-
tors at a meeting Monday
night.

The faculty spoof. was pub-
lished as a supplement to The
Davidsonian’s April 6th issue.

Erwin’s resignation was trig-
gered by faculty questions con-
cerning the offensive nature of
the lampoon.

English Professor Charles
Lloyd said, ‘‘Charles had great
possibilities as an editor, but
resigning was the right thing
for him to do."

Lloyd added, “All of us ought
to be more loving and consider-

ate of each other. The important
thing is not what people say
about us; the important thing is
to do what is right.”

McLawhorn said Erwin’s re-
signation was unfortunate be-
cause ‘‘Charles had such great
knowledge of journalism and he
had done so much for the paper
in the last three years.”

McLawhorn, a junior, has
served The Davidsonian for
three years. He was Assistant
News Editor, News Editor,
Sports Editor, and Senior News
Editor before his appointment
as co-editor this week.

Garner said, ‘“‘It took a lot of
courage for Charles to express
his apology and to offer his
resignation before the entire
community.”

She added that Erwin’s:resig-
nation was inevitable because of
faculty objections to last week’s
lampoon.

Garner, also a junior, has
served The Davidsonian as both
Focus and Features Editor.

As far as The Davidsonian’'s

(See Erwin, page 1)

was not to prevent the McGuire
plant from going into operation.
It is almost completed and
scheduled to open around 1981.
Instead, Little described the
demonstration as a “show of

concérn”’ about the safety of the

in ae — ay

plant.

Yoder added that the demon-
stration was a signal that the
public would not tolerate the
construction of any more nuc-
lear plants in the Lake Norman
area.

Little hopes anti-nuclear pro-
tests such as Sunday’s will raise
public awareness of the prob-
lems with nuclear power and
encourage people ‘‘to contact
public officials about their con-
cerns. ”’ :

Dean White leaves Davidson for new career

By BILL WILSON

Staff Writer
After twenty-four years as a
Davidson administrator, eigh-
teen as Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid, H. Edmunds
White is resigning his post to
become the new Athletic Direc-
tor at Southwestern University,
University of Memphis. White,
who replaces Dick Thornton at
Southwestern, will assume his

new duties this July.
White, a 1947 Davidson gra-

_ duate, returned to the College

eight years later as Assistant
Dean of Students. He said in
this position he was very much
involved-with admissions. He
has served in his present role
since 1962.

White was a Davidson bas-
ketball player with an A aver-
age, and during his first year as
Assistant Dean of Students
here he coached the junior
varsity basketball team.

Through his interest and par-
ticipation (he is a regionally-
ranked tennis player), he has
remained close to the world of
sports. “I have kept up with it
as an observer, and by talking
with coaches at great length,”
he said.

White said he has been
interested in a position in

athletic administration ‘‘for six

or eight years without actively
pursuing it. Then, when I heard
about this vacancy back in
November, I applied for the
job.”’

White described Southwest-
ern as ‘‘a school like Davidson
in nature, although their athle-
tic program is different.’
Southwestern’s athletic teams
participate in the NCAA’s Div-
ision III, which does not permit
the issuance of student athletic
grants. Davidson is in Division
IA, and is able to grant athletic
scholarships.

One of White's chief goals for
the coming year is to strengthen
Southwestern’s athletic prog-
ram while maintaining its aca-
demic atmosphere.

‘They're getting someone
who recognizes the academic

“program as the primary prior-

ity,”’ he said of himself. ‘‘We
can have a strong Division III
program within that context.
The athletic program should be
a great big plus to the primary

purpose of the institution,” he
added.

Mrs. Anne Marie Williford,
Dean of Students at Southwest-
ern, said, ‘‘Mr. White brings so
many needed administrative
skills, as well as his life-long
interest in athletics, both var-
sity and other levels.”

College President Sam Spen-
cer said he feels ‘“Dean White's
departure will be a tremendous
loss. For years, throughout the
admissions profession in which
he is so highly respected, his
name has been synonymous
with integrity and high stan-
dards. We will greatly miss his
total devotion to the college and
his high competence in one of its
most important positions.”

As of now, no replacement for
White has been found, accor-
ding to Spencer.

By RICK JENKINS

half Monday™“afternoon 200

student — faculty committee

operations, Chairman Harry

Greyard opened the forum by
saying, ‘‘We (the Media Board)
do not anticipate any action

‘being taken at this meeting.”’

But Davidsonian. Editor
Charles Erwin then stood and
offered his resignation to the
Media Board. He said he ac-
cepted full responsibility for the
issue, “‘A Guide to Courses at
Davidson,” and apologized to
any faculty members who were
