A Story

Once upon a time there was a man named
Jim. Jones, or he might have been called
John Smith. He liked the usual things,
sand disliked just as many: Sometimes he
was happy: then he smiled. Sometimes he
was not; then he frowned. On sunny, clear
Saturdays he played golf, or fished, or just
loaied at home after work. On rainy Mon-
davs (and on most sunny Mondays) he
had the blues.

He did his share of griping, and now and
then spoke a brief (very brief) word of
praise—ii he didn't have anything else to
say. When something new came in he was
around. the jirst to try it, and then to criti=
cise it. If a different idea was making the
rounds he immediately_took it up, became
wildly enthusiastic, and then forgot it. When
a plan was presented. he was among the

_ first to endorse it. Tis enthusiasm lasted
a jew days, and then his business became

Now that Duke Dormitory

that North and South could finally
be torn down. These “barracks”
were originally put up only
temporary purposes. Of course cer-

has
seems to me

tain improvements have. been add-
ed over the years, but they are
still rickety and are certainly an
ieyesore to the campus. We all feel

,CHOOSING AN ALMA MATER
| Dear Andy:

| In looking over the copy tonight
| 1 noticed what Hoss Reeves and

Billy Masters had to say about a

new Alma Mater for Davidson. I'd
tlike to take this opportunity to’ say
thar 1 agree with them, and their
idea.

Davidson has too long been with-
out a real Alma Mater. Any other
schéol of this size and reputation
would have a suitable Alma Mater,
which has become traditional, and
is known and loved.

We. should select a song this ycar;

while the problem is familiar to the T

entice student body. Ii there is
tio selection made, then next year’s
freshman class again will learn “O,
Davidson!" partly as a football sorig,

group was saying somewhat the same
things. Now they have handed over the
symbols of office, plus the duties and re-—
sponsibilities of the same, Their responsi-_

- The announcement of Shaw Smith's de-
cision to accept Davidson's offer of the
position comes as a surprise to most of us.
But although it may be a surprise, it is ‘in-
deed a welcome one.

While a student at Davidson. Shaw was
1 one of the most universally popular mem-
bers of the student body, But popularity
alone was not all that he stood for. Talent-
ed in many ways, he showed that man can
smile, mingle freely with his fellows. be
considered as one of them, and still be a
Christian. It is rare that one finds such
.a man.

The majority has been faithiul towards
those who put them in their positions. Some
tew have not. But for the greater part. the
various officers. and leaders have done a
good job, maybe not the best, but as well
as has been possible. To this group on the
thanks and eormmendation of the student

It is our belief that Shaw will iill his
position with better than average ability.
Those*who have preceded him through the
years have been good, and the office of Y.

great, else they are not worth having. Un-
less a man may proiit by his position, he
should not. have_it. And this profit that,
may come to the man is dependent on the
quantity and quality of that which he puts
into. his’ particular task. That—old, but
true, axiom still applies—“One gains only
as one gives.”

with any of them.

_—~ Next year Davidson has a man who can
count: students from all groups as his -
friends. There is always the need for a
man who unifies all types of students and
draws them into the YMCA work on the
‘campus. Too long there has been a divid-
ing- line between certain groups, some-
thing which has never been looked at open-
ly, but which has nevertheless proved a big
difficulty in the entire program.

The new YMCA officers,
board of control should fit in well with
Smith also. On the cabinet and in posi-
‘tions of leadership, are -men of all-types—
something which has been a rarity in the
past. Next year there will be a more truly
representative group in control of the ‘Y’.
Working with Smith, the YMCA leaders
will be able to interest afl men—not, as
has been the case too often in the past,
about a half. This better rounded set of
leaders will have a wonderful opportunity
to unite all classes and groups into a solid
front. Not for years has representation
been so well distributed among all classes
of men.

Now is thé time for new plans, hopes,
and visions. Many will iail, but the few
that come true are the ones that make it
all worthwhile. As new men begin work,
it can only be said that if they live up to
the records of their immediate and earlier
predecessors they will indeed be able to
point with pride one year irom now. The —
shoes left vacant are large, but have been

_ well-filled. The abilities are present, which
leaves only the question of the will to

Accomplishment issmeasured in various
ways. To too many it means the actual
results, or the lack of them. But every
person should not be judged on the sam
set basis. Talents are always unequall
divided. \Judgment should be on a basis of
relative ability—on the amount possible
for each person. If, at this time next year,
it can be said “He did his absolute best,”~
then the highest tribute has been given.
Honor to the man who does the best, but
the highest honor is reserved for him who |
does his best.

Therefore, as plans are laid for the com-
ing year, we welcome Shaw Smith, and ex-
press the hope that through his life and
work, along with that of a well_belanced
group of leaders, Davidson’s YMCA may
grow in strength, influence, and service.
