necessary in case of an accident.

the plan can be used for other —

disasters such as toxic chemical

Davidson Mayor Nancy Mac-

evaluated by the state, the
county, and the town. ‘‘We plan
to have a meeting in January to
discuss the test results,” said
MacCormac. ‘‘We want com-
munity response and are willing
to meet with local civic groups
to discuss the plan.” ,

Cats were also unable to cope
with the speed of State which
accounted for seven uncontest-
ed layups in the-first half alone.

And even though playing
superbly against Wofford,
guards McConnell and Gullick-
son could not match the speed
of the Wolfpack; in fact, the two
combined: for only four points
and two assists compared to 22
points and 11 assists against
Wofford.

One question mark that re-
mains after two games is whe-
ther or not DiBenedetto will be
able to get involved in the
Wildcat offense. Admittedly,
Richie D.’s power moves inside
were not needed against Wof-
ford, but were sorely missed in
the State game. If the Cats
hope to be southern Conference
contenders, its guards must be
more effective in finding the big
man who finished with only
seven points against the Wolf-
pack.

fighting,’’ Howell says.

For example, Howell com-
plains, the yearbook will be
allowed to stay on the registra-
tion checkoff system even
though it regularly collects less
than the required 10 percent
support.

Indiana Vice President Ken-
neth Gros Louis argues the
school decided that certain i-
tems, like the yearbook, get _
waivers from the 10 percent
requirement because‘ ‘‘it’s an
academic, not a politi¢#t thihg.”’
He also denies any complicity
between the administration and
private businesses to stop
InPIRG.

Dave Jones says university
administrators have become in-
creasingly involved in the af-
fairs or PIRG chapters since to
does threaten many of their
friends in the business com-
munity.

“As we've become more effec-
tive, businesses have become
more sophisticated in their at-
tempts to stop us. They are
certainly more opposed to us
than they used to be,’’ Jones
says.

Jones adds that any recent
financial difficulties among
PIRG chapters can probably be
mostly attributed to that kind
of administration interference.

Indeed, Indiana isn’t the only
campus where administrators
have inhibited the PIRGs’ fund-
raising efforts. At Rice last
year, university President Nor-
man Hackerman threatened to
take Tex-PIRG off student
registration forms.

At Michigan State, admini-
stators actually did take the
MSU PIRG chapter off the
forms. University guidelines re-
quire that 20 percent of the
students must support a group
to keep it on the forms. In
spring, 1979, MSU administra-
tors ruled that PIRG hadn't
gotten enough support, and
erased the check-off for the
group.

A subsequent audit dis-
covered the university had mis-
counted student support.
Moses Turner, student affairs
director, allowed PIRG back on
the registration forms this fall,
but only if PIRG agreed to
increased its payment to the
university from $840 a term to
$1000 a term.

Yet on other campuses it is
clearly the students themselves
who are deciding not to pay
extra fees to support PIRGs.
Jones, Howell, and other PIRG
officials, however, refuse to
attribute the declines in support
to student apathy about the
groups.

Jones says the vision of the
silent student body was a media
concoction that does not reflect
the truth.

players by the Admissions Of-
fice. The decrease of $15,330
from 1979 indicated a drop in
total financial need among foot-
ball players.

“This printout does not re-
flect our contribution to other
sports,’ Carnegie said. Other
contributions are not listed on
the athletic budget because
they are accounted for as regu-
lar College funds.

Last year the Wildcat Club
raised $188,000 in gift and
program sale income and $20,
000 in endowed funds, Carnegie
said. The College allocated this
money to various parts of the
athletic program. ‘‘We’re doing
a lot of things maybe we don’t
take credit for,’’ Carnegie said.

In the future, according to
Carnegie, Wildcat Club funds
will be budgeted to each of the
sports ‘‘on a more formal bas-
ia.’’ He said Bingham has
strongly urged this change in
budgetary procedure.

Bingham, who became athlet-
ic director this fall, said he is
now using zero-based budgeting
in compiling the proposed 1961-
82 athletic budget. Instead of
using last year’s budget as a
starting point, he will complete-
ly re-evaluate every athletic

to determine its finan-

_ program
cial need. Zero-based

budgeting
does not endanger the College's
commitment to specific sports,
he. added.

Bingham’s tentative athletic
budget will undergo review by .
