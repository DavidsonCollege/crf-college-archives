Committee is attempting to
assemble profile sheets of the
Class of ’74 in order to aid
counseling efforts.

“We are working diligently

forums where students can
meet practicing lawyers, law

“We want the pre-law

Avinger.

The committee also itis
to provide its advisees with in-

have interested some of my
advisees,’’ remarked Avinger.
