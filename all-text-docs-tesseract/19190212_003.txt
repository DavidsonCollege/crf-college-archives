Phi Society Meeting.

A short but very interesting program
was held by the Phi Society, Saturday
night. In spite of the fact the time for
the speakers was cut short on account
of the basketball yame, the debate prov-
ed to be one of the most interesting held
this term. “‘Vhe query was: “Resolved,
That Ireland should be given Home
Rule.” The affirmative was upheld by
Boney and LaFar, who advanced the
following points: (1) The Irish have
served Great Britain well in the recent
war: (2) Religious sentiment keeps the
Irish under British rule.

The negative was defended by Rog-
ers and. Poole, who used logical and
convincing points, namely: Britain's
position demands the Irish ports for her
protectian; (2) ‘The majority in Treland
are in favor of Home Rule. In the re-
buttal the negative not oily tore down
the contending points, but also turned
some of them in favor of their. awn side.

The judges, Hart, Alexander and
Sample, decided two to one in favor of
the negative.

A declamation, “The Flag Maker.”
was given by “Tuft. Spence gave an
oration on the Trish question which add-

ed humor to the meeting. L. B. Me-
Keithan delivered a timely oration on
“America’s benefits from the recent
war.” ‘

The president urged all new men to
enter the Fresh-Soph debating contest to
be held March 17.

Eumenean Meeting.

The Eumenean Society program last
Saturday night was very interesting and
was not lacking in enthusiasm. S. A.
Burgess was elected to membership in
the society.

The subject for debate was: ‘‘Resolv-
ed, That the bill giving the Irish Home
Rule should be made effective at once.”
R. T. L. Liston. first speaker for the
affirmative, introduced the question and
gave the history of Irish oppression and
their atempts to obtain Home Rule in
a very forceful manner. C. B. Robson
was first speaker on the negative. He
contended that Ireland was ruled thru
the British Parliament just as Wales,
Scotland and England. The next speak-
er on the affirmative was R. H. Boyd.
who argued that Ireland deserved equal
privileges with Canada and other Eng-
lish possessions who have Home Rule.
Brittenhirt was second speaker for the
negative. T. N. Atkinson, last speaker
for the affirmative, gave present condi-

Decides on This Goal.

Last Tuesday night saw the inaugura-
tion of a new system of operating the
“Y" on the campus. Mir. Miles, as
usual, was at the bottom of the new
plan. He chose, as the time for present-
ing, a “feed” of the Y. MLC. A.
cabinet members and committeemen ‘at
the Henderson Hotel. Most ot — the
boys went to the “feed” mainly to “get
something to eat.” and they were not
disappointed. But in addition, they got
something better. “Chere was not a per-
son there that night who did not leave
with a vision of a better and more en-
ergetic Y. M. C. A, for Davidson Col-
lege. ‘The plan. as explained by, Mr.
Miles. proposes to -have every man on
the .campus ins an organization which
will resemble a Company. Mir, Miles
is the commmanderan-chief. president of
Y. MLC. A. is the colonel. ‘The cabi-
net members are the lieutenants, the as
sistants are the corporals, and every oth-
er man in college is in a squad. “There
are seven: men on the cabinet. Rach of
these has five men under him as assis:
tants. “hese forty-two men make what
is known as the Promotion Committee.
Fach member of this committer has. six
or seven men under him. ft is his duty
to see that every man on his committee
is taking the proper interest in the “Y"
meetings. and remind him when there is
any special “Y" work to be done, When
any man lacks interest in the “Y" meet-
ings. the cabinet members look him up
and. find the man whose committee he
is on. ‘Thus the responsibility is placed
definitely on somebody and when any-
thing goes wrong the officers can place
their finger on the sore s.ot at once.

‘The promotion Committee is not an
untried theory. ft has atready proved
its worth at several colleges whith have
adopted it. It was under the Promotion
Committee system that the University of
Georgia raised the record amount for
Southern colleges in. the United War
Work Drive last fall, $30,000. It can
be a success here at Davidson College.
if the student body gets behind it. It
will date a new era for the Y. MLC.
A. at Davidson—if you are willing to
back it. Do your share.

tions of Ireland and contended that all
reasons for the delay of the bilb that
might exist in their borders had been re-
moved. Cellar closed the debate for the
negative by arguing concrete reasons why
Ireland was in a better condition than
English possessions who had. Home Rule.
The rebuttals were brief as the time for
each speaker had been limited to five
minutes. “he judges and the house de-
cided in favor of the affirmative.

W. W. Moore gave as a declamation
one of the Roman gladiatorial addresses.

G. M. Robson gave a very instructive
oration on the “Effectiveness of — the
platoon as a fighting unit.” H. B.

Dendy was elected marshall to fill the
vacancy caused by resignation of 5S, ‘I.
