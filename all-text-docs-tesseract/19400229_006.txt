Porter Talks
About Terms
Science Uses

Professor of Biology Address-
es Science Department Of
Faculty

| Dr. W. L. Porter, Professor
of Geology, Geography, and
Biology at Davidson, spoke to
the Science Department of the
Faculty Monday afternoon on
\“The Language of Science.”
The group had as its guests
|Dr. W. J. Martin, President
'Emeritus of Davidson, Dr.
Johnston, and Mr. F.
W. Hengeveld, Registrar

Dr. Porter explained that “Alge-
bra as we know it today was intro-
duced into Europe about a thou-
sand years ago by the Arabs. In
both arithmetic and algebra the
terminology is largely of Latin orig-
in, since Latin was the language of
the school men. They adopted the
Arabic name since the idea of alge-
bra was new but they employed
the already familiar names for its
processes.

Geometry Discussed
Geometry, the science of spatial
relations, was devoloped by the old
Greeks and considered by them the
perfect because its find-
ings are true for all time. Dr. Port-
er pointed out the fact that this
science has undergone less change
than any other science having been
in a state of relative stagnation
sinee the time of Euclid, who lived
about three hundred B. C.

“As physics emerged in the dim

science

past into a body of scientific
thought, it was an omnibus,” said
Dr. Porter. He showed how it

embraced the knowledge of all nat-
ural phenomena and included chem-
istry, geology, zoology, botany and
geography, which today are
sidered separate sciences.
Committee Appointed

Prof. McGavock as _ chairman,
Prof. Wood, and Prof. Fulcher
were appointed as a committee to
look into the situation of devising
a new system for aiding students
in making applications for gradu-
ate work. At the next meeting the
committee's work will be presented
and some action will be taken. The
plan when perfected will go into

con-
as

effect next year. Dr. Porter and
Dr. S. B. Knight presided over
the meeting.

QUESTION OF THE WEEK

[Continued from Page Five]
off the list when he casts his bal-
lot. This would be a sure way of
keeping the ballot box from’ being
stuffed. Under the system as out-
lined in the first proposed amend-
ment, it would be possible for
someone to sign another person’s
name to an extra ballot, and when
the election officers find two bal-
lots with the same signatures, they
would have no possible way of
determining which is the valid vote.

Many members of the group have

work has been done by Ben Col-

lacks only a few hours for his pri-
