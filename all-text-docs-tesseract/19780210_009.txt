Then we saw the truck and crane
leave much heavier than they came.

The big tree fell last night,

and took half the sidewalk with it.

Wearing brightly coloured woolen stoles,
angibearingiNikone,.
photographers gathered,

composed celluloid eulogies for their portfolios.

My mother’s family album
held the glossy remains of long-dead uncles,
people resting in their coffins.

Photographers captured twisted limbs,
delicate ice-encased stems,

and bark that they couldn’t reach before.
Seated among the tree’s branches

one lady posed with poodle.

A gifted aunt would sometimes arrange flowers
to offset the once-relative’s pallor-
Chrysanthemums,

and a lily at the head.

Or, there was Aunt Gertrude,
photographed, in housedress,

replete with hairnet,

scuffs and feather-duster,

beside double-breasted Uncie George
on the bed where they laid him out.

Photographers rushed out

to find the communion of whirr and click

to witness the miracle of crystal fading to moss,
spoke in reverent tones of the late tree’s demise
how he'd lost color lately,

how they found him-wandering

naked downtown the tuesday before.

| would wonder often if my uncles

had on, under the closed half of the coffin,

any pants.

One of the family picture-takers,

Mary Rose, my cousin,

was inexperienced in these matters,
stood too far from the casket

so that Aunt Millie’s hand

bearing a cup of tea got into the picture,
and Uncle Harry’s foot
