‘The regatta was- sailed under

three more B races.

The day started out-very cold

calmed down to a pleasant 6-8

sailed their worst races early
and saved their best perfor-
mances for late in the regatta.
Harris had a third and a fifth in
the first two A division races,
the fifth coming after being over
the line early.

However, Harris came back
in his final three races of the day

out slow with a third and a
fourth, but came on with a first,
a fourth, and a second in his
final three races.

The sailing team’s season
continues this Saturday at the
lake campus with the second
points regatta of the spring
season.

Harris commented on the
team’s hopes for the weekend,
‘We should have an advantage
since we'll be sailing our own
boats on familiar water; howe-
ver the worries that come with
running the regatta sometimes
tend to offset that advantage,
so we will just have to wait and
see.”

Teams from Duke, N.C.
State, U.Va., ODU, and Chris-
topher Newport College will
participate in this weekend's
regatta.

Batters overpower
opposing pitchers

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer

Last Friday, the Wildcat
baseball team lost 10-9 in a
hard-fought slugging duel
against Slippery St.. The
Cats had been riding high after
their impressive victories over
Muskingum (17-2) and Glen-
ville St. (11-0). Coach Palmer
Muench feared the Cats might

have a slow start against Slip-
pery Rock, a much more ag-
gressive opponent than the
teams played earlier in the
week. Having won these two
games somewhat easily, the
Cats may have suffered a loss of
intensity against Slippery
Rock

The Cats allowed Slippery
Rock to run up the score to 7-0
in the first few innings. Muench
explained that the Cats’
starting pitcher, John Madden,
“really didn’t throw too badly,
but our defense let him down on
several crucial plays.’’ The early
inning errors and the powerful
Slippery Rock hitting forced the
coach to bring in freshman
pitcher Dave Tornetta in the
second inning. Helped by the
Cat defense which finally set-
tled into its usual consistency,
Tornetta pitched seven strong
innings, Muench said after the
game that the 6’4’’ hard-
throwing freshman had finally
become a college *‘pitcher rather
than just a thrower.”

Despite being down 7-0 early
in the game, the Cats never
gave up, as they slowly chipped
away at the Slippery Rock lead.
Patiently they moved the score

to 10-5 entering the last half of
the ninth inning. With two hits
and one walk, the Cats loaded
the bases. Then the leading Cat
power hitter, Stan Brown, came
to the plate. Tension mounted

as the 6'4”’ senior swung might-
ily at two pitches, both of
which he missed. The flood-
gates of tension burst forth in
relief as the crash of Brown’ s
bat signalled a stunning ‘“‘grand
slam"? home run, moving the

Cats to within one run. Despite
getting the next batter on base,
the Cats were unable to get that
tying run across the plate, and
so lost the hard-fought contest.

After the game, Muench was
pleased with his team’s refusal
to give up. “A lot of teams
would have given up when
behind by seven runs, but we
stuck with it and showed our
ability to come from behind.”
The coach feels the team needs
to start quicker, rather than
waiting several innings before
beginning their aggressive at-
tack. The Cats must stop their

opponents from Jumping ahead
in the early innings, so that
they will not be forced to play
“catch-up” as each game pro-

gresses.
