Student
pulls Knife
at Warner

By MICHAEL TELLIS
Staff Writer

Police shut down Warner
Hall’s Halloween party last
Saturday night because of fight-
ing that resulted in a student
brandishing a knife.

This has been the first time in
recent history that weekend
revelry has been halted by dis-
ruptive behavior.

“An anonymous complainant
advised the officer working the
Warner event of a conversation
he had just overheard.
Apparently two male subjects
at the event were at odds with
each other, at some point one of
them stated he would cut the
other and then pulled out what
appeared to be a folded switch-
blade,” Director of Public
Safety and Chief of Police
Fountain Walker said.

“The complainant immedi-
ately informed the officer, who
in turn approached the individ-
ual reported to have the weapon
and escorted him outside. The
subject was cooperative with
the officer and admitted to hav-
ing a switchblade
asked,” Walker said.

According to Walker, there
was another incident of fighting
at the party that occurred
between three different individ-
uals.

“This altercation also
involved members of our com-
munity as well and involved a
lack of good old interpersonal
communication skills and prob-
lem solving _ techniques,”
Walker said.

Though the police main-
tained that the individuals
involved did not show any out-
ward signs of being inebriated,
President of Warner Hall Alice
Neumann ’06 disagreed.

According to Neumann, the
individuals involved in the
fights were intoxicated upon

entering the party.
They immediately began
roughhousing and pushing peo-

Students robbed in
satellite parking lot

By LEx! HAMILTON
Senior Staff Writer

Four males robbed _ three
Davidson College seniors in the
satellite parking lot behind
Jamieson apartments at about 2
a.m. on Friday, October 22.

During their drive back to
Davidson from Wendy’s, the three
students, along with a visiting
brother, noticed a dark, medium-
sized vehicle following them.

“I noticed that they were follow-
ing us by the light between the
VAC and the admissions building,”
one of the seniors said.

After turning left on Griffith
Street, the four black men, who
were in their mid-20s, continued to
follow the students down Ridge
Road. When the students pulled
into a parking space in senior satel-
lite parking, the perpetrators pulled
into the parking space directly
opposite them.

“We had a chance to drive off,”
one of the seniors said, “but we
didn’t, because I said, ‘Don’t worry
guys, they look cool.’ To tell you
the truth we deserved to get robbed
for being that dumb.”

As the students got out of their
car, it became clear that the men in
the other vehicle were not
Davidson College students.

“At this point, only one of the
men got out of the vehicle, and he
stuck his hand in his shirt, shouting
that he had a weapon,” Director of
Public Safety and Chief of Police

ey) Sa og NEWS:

Fountain Walker said. The students

_ never actually saw the weapon.

Each student produced his wallet
when the assailant commanded
them to do so, but only one student
had money on him. °

“There were four of us,”’ one of
the seniors said, “but only I was
mugged. He got between $3 and
$13.”

Cash in hand, the criminal turned
around to re-enter the vehicle and
join his three accomplices only to
find that they had already begun to
drive down Ridge Road.

“The perpetrator with the money
chased the vehicle. The other three
finally stopped, and he jumped
inside the car,” Walker said.

Campus Police responded to the
mugging in less than five minutes.

According to Walker, students
need to be more aware of their sur-
roundings.

“The demographics of this area
are changing. The Davidson com-
munity is often targeted for crimes
because of its reputation for trust-
worthiness and affluence. If you
see something that doesn’t look
right, call the police, ask for an
escort, and remember as many
details about the situation as you
can.”

Walker also stressed the impor-
tance of remembering details while
a crime is in process. Providing an
accurate description of an individ-
ual, vehicle, or remembering a

Town makes plans for
transit rail to Charlotte

---By KATIE PFEIFFER
Senior Staff Writer

Plans to construct a transit rail
system running from Davidson to
Charlotte are in final approval
stages. The transit rail should be
finished in 2009 or 2010.

Kris Krider, Planning Director
for the Town of Davidson,
described the transit system plan as
a product of a growing need to eco-
nomically and culturally expand
the town while maintaining its aes-
thetic qualities.

“We have an opportunity to
attract what Davidson lacks,”
Krider said. ‘“[Today in Davidson]
there’s a more active crowd that
demands a more active, urban
lifestyle. There’s a potential for

‘attracting the young, urban profes-

sional.”
The North Corridor transit line

will extend from Charlotte to
Davidson, and in the future possi-
bly as far as Mooresville. The sta-
tion stop in Davidson will likely be
located behind the ITS building.
To let the trains make timely and
effective runs, some street cross-
ings in town must be closed. Plans
to close the street crossing in front
of the Brickhouse could adversely
affect the commute of the many
students who live off campus in the

area, including Armour Street,
Delburg Street, and the Depot
Apartments.

Initial station plans include two
stops in Huntersville and one stop
in Cornelius and Davidson. The
train station in Charlotte will incor-
porate other lines as well, includ-
ing Amtrak, Greyhound, and addi-
tional local connections.

Watson Fellowship
finalists selected

By MICHAEL TELLIS
Staff Writer

Davidson College recently nom-
inated Adam Martin, Chris Clunie,
Christie Kilby, and Lucy Marcil as
its Thomas J. Watson Fellowship
finalists.

‘The students will compete
against 200 national finalists for
the Watson Fellowship, a one-year
$25,000 grant for independent
study and travel outside the United
States awarded to up to 50 graduat-
ing college seniors nominated by
their participating institutions.

“The Watson is great because it

brings out the applicants imagina-
tion. If you take away the financial
constraints, there is no limit to how
much you can dream, and that is
exactly what the Watson gives you
an opportunity to do,’ Dean of
Students Tom Shandley said.

The proposals of the finalists this
year show great diversity and cover
a wide range of topics.

Clunie, a political science major
and member of the men’s varsity _
basketball team, wants to study
basketball and its ability to enact
change and influence global poli-
