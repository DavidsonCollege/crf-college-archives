If I Were 2] Again

(Editor’s Note; It is the editor’s belief that
the following article by Dr, Roy E. Hoke, Ph. D.,
which appeared in the Sunday morning, Novem-
ber 16, issue of the Charlotte Observer, will be of

‘ much interest to the Davidson student body and

‘Someone has said:

is herewith reprinted in full.)

Many people have undertaken to write on
this and similar subjects. | suppose no two
people think alike in a matter of this kind.
To meditate on #his-tépic should be helpful
not only to those who are about twenty-one
years of age but to all others. It is never too
late to make needed changes in our. lives.

(1) If T were twenty-one again I would pay
proper attention to my physical condition.
Exercise stimulates circulation of the blood;
circulation determines the’ quality of the
blood; digestion depends on the quality of
the blood; good health depends upon diges-
tion; and happiness depends upon health. A
college professor once said: ‘‘ Personally,
would rather have for a father a robust
burglar than a weak, narro\w-chested, con-
sumptive bishop,’’

A hearty laugh is an excellent tonic.
‘Laughter is the thunder
of optimism.’’ Very few men have ever died
while laughing. I would laugh a little, sing @
little, smile much and walk a lot. Good health...
is life’s first prize.

(2) If I were twenty-one again I would
try to secure ‘the best possible education.
Every person, sooner or later, should be pre-
pared to carn a living. It is becoming dif-
ficult to earn a living with an education to-
“day: When one starts out in life with very
little education and must compete with those
who have had much preparation, there ‘are
two strikes on him at the start. I would find

‘Some worthy work*that needed to be done.

“and elsewhere,

If I liked it and had the ability necessary for
it, it would be my work.

(3) If I were twenty-one again I would
make some preparation for the married life.
I would study marriage courses in college
T would learn what adjust-
necessary, [I would study.about

ments are

children and how to deal with their problems.
Jf it later was my lot to be married, 1 would

. have

gained much, If J] never married, I
would still be a better citizen for this knowl-
edge,

_ (4).

If I were twenty-one again I would

strive for originality in thinking. Someone

at
at

“has. Said: ‘*At the age of ten we wonder,
“twenty we imagine, at thirty we. cogitate,
_forty’ we think, at fifty we have ‘‘an idea or
““two,’? at sixty we have two ideas and at
geventy we are working on ‘‘one idea.”’ The
“sooner we get to that one idea the hetter. We
should dream dreams no mortal ever dared
_to dream before. We are all"born originals.
“Most people, unfortunately, die duplicates.
Bad thinking ig “fhe mother of bad doing. The
man who goes wrong, thinks wrong. Think

“tight! ‘CAs a man thinks in his heart,’ that

pretty much is what he is. Be original!

(5). If I were twenty-one again I would
have convictions and make decisions, The
secret of many a man’s failure is that he
lacked convictions, A man without, eqnvic-
tion: is as weak asa gate hanging on its
lower hinge. I have noticed’ that the great
men of history—Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Lin-
coln, Wilson and thousands of others—have

all been men of conviction, They made de-
cisions, In an age of uncertainty, such as the
one we are living in, the world is ready to
follow the ones who know what they really
want. A preacher who preaches for the praise
of his fellow-ministers is bound to fail. The
psychologist who writes to gain.the applause
of the professors, and who himself has no
convictions, would do well to stop. There
are only two thinkers in the whole universe
-God and man.

(6). If I were twenty-one again I would
do my best to achieve a splendid success in
some worthy work. Every young person
should have some early success. A taste of
success in youth is like a taste to a young
lion. I would seek a type of work that is not
too crowded. Today is the best day in the
history of the world for a young man or
woman and the United States is the best
place. America is history’s focal spot.

(7) If I were twenty-one again 1 would
crowd my brain with the beautiful poetry
and lovely gems of thought of the ages. It

is said that Martin Luther always placed 4,

flower on his desk before he began to write.
His stormy nature needed the soothing in-
fluence of that delicate beauty. We all do.
‘While the eyil days come not.’’ ‘‘In my
Father’s house are many mansions.’’ ‘They
shall hunger no more, neither thirst.’’

“The hours I spent with thee, dear heart,
Are asa string of pearls to me;
I count them over, every one apart,
My rosary; my rosary.”

These gems are like a rock in a weary
land. They soothe the soul.

If 1 were twenty-one again I would
be careful in the selection of my friends.
I would seek friends of about my own age
but have a few who are somewhat older.
They can be a great help in many ways to a
younger life. I would seek not a great nun-
of friends but a smaller number who are
tried and true.

If | were twenty-one again I
be very careful in financial matters. |
try by every honorable means to get ahead
but would take advantage of no one. T would
be willing to work hard for what I earn and
then expect to collect, I would try to be in-
dependent of father’s pocketbook and would
keep away from doles and relief. I would ex-
pect fo earn iny own way, | would be gener-
ous with such means as came inte my pos-

(10) If I were twenty-one again I would
dedicate my life to Jesus Christ—if I had
not done so before, L would give the flower
of my youth to Him. I would not wait until
my hair had turned white and then throw
the ashes of my misspent life in His face. If
one lives for God—then youth is opportunity,
manhood is achievement and old age is holy
memory.

Letters to thie ,
Editor

Dear

Editor:

I have just had a disgusting experience.
Disgusting, and alarming, if What it implies
is true. I’ve just left-a chapel program that
emphasized what is, I believe, one grave de-
fect in-our conduct at chapel. y

The person reading the Bible was a pro-
fessor with a normal set of vocal cords, whose
‘voice would have been perfec tly intelligible
had it not been for the constant buzz, not all
from freshmen and sophomores, that filled
the auditor ium.
the president of the college, and one wonders
if even he could hear the reading, above the
noise. Outside

of any sense of reverence, re-
spect for- the speaker should have assured
quiet while he read, Are we kindergartners ?

Davidson is, nominally, a Christian col-

lege. The individual beliefs of the student
body cannot be dictated, nor should they,
Buf whether or not you, 1, or the next one

believes that the Bible is the inspired Word

of God, respect for itas a tegaey from the
past relevant to the present should require
silence while-it-is read And if this is not
enough, how about a little respect for those

few who might want to hear it?

Don’t get me wrong,
a suggestion that we convert ourselves into
emasculate ‘plaster saints,’? who sit in trans-
fixed silence throughout the program, never
voicing an opinion on anything, nor am I
setting myself up as an exemplar of chapel
conduct. But this is a suggestion, nay a plea,
that we either (1) Give the Bible the respect
most Christkins believe it is due, or (2) GIVE
UP ALL PRETENSE TO BEING A CHRIS.

By SAM ERVIN

Before we toss our memories of
1947 into that ever present ashcan
commonly referred to as forgetful-
ness, we might do well to recall a
few of the experiences that
have had during the past year, anc
to review some the if
any, that we have learned as a re-
sult of them, Sure, we've got every
right to be proud of Davidson and
what it stands for, but I'm willing
to bet that no one would venture to
declare that there isn’t room. for
some improvement. Therefore,
with your permission, I'll indulge
in the time honored custom of list-
ing a few “resolutions” that might
to some extent at Yeast help us to
get a little closer to our goal.

(1) Both the faculty and the stu-
dents should resolve to continue to
cooperate with each other. The re-
lations between these two groups
on the campus have always been
carried on in a spirit of understand-
ing and fair play, and that. is as it
should be. We want_no. part of the
impersonal faculty-student associa-
tions that prevail at other colleges
and universities in this region.

(2) We should also make every
effort to more loyally support the
Wildcat varsity and J, V. squads
in 1948. The guys who wear the
Red Black deserve
credit fot the victories that they've

lotte.

(3) Nor should we ever forget
our fellow students and their wel-
fare. There is still a great deal of
unnecessary noise in the dormi-
tories. Let's resolve to do away
with some of it. It’s really not hard
to do if you just think for a few
seconds before you sound off with-
out reason. I'm positive that every-
one who is trying to study will ap-
preciate it, and will cefrain from
‘creating a disturbance when you're
on the drive,

(4) It seems to me that we
should also try to .participate in
more of the worthwhile activities
on the campus. Valuable experi-
ence and genuine pleasure can be
gained by taking part ia the work
of the Y, by serving oa the staff
of one of the many scheel publica-
tions, or by joining one of the
many other student clubs and or-
ganizations which contribute some-
thing of value to our college life.
No one advocates that this be done
to the exclusion of one’s studies,
but most of us do have some leisure
time that could be speat more
profitably.

This list only begins to scratch
the surface, of course. Rather than
continue it, I prefer to let you take
it from here and complete it to con-
form with your own shortcomings,
if any. Maybe a few of you have no
need for resolutions, but [™have a
