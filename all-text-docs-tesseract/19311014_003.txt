THE SPORTS PARADE

BEAT THOSE
BLUE DEVILS

The Davidson Wildcats have performed

many and strange feats in their day, but
strangest of all was that of last Saturday,
when, after holding a lead of 6-0 until the
last quarter, they allowed the V. P. I. Gob-
blers to score three touchdowns. Very sel-
dom have we heard of the Wildcats weak-
ening in the last quarter, especially after

leading for three previous quarters,

The only solution seems to lie in the fact
that VY, 15

pounds, man for man, and that the smaller

P.T. outweighed Davidson over

team was simply worn down by the man-
Mountain machine from Virginia. From. all
reports, the Wildeats completely outclassed
the Gobblers during the first half, but as re-
serve strength was sadly lacking, the reg-
wlars couldn't stand up under the strain of
constant pressure.

And now comes the news that Mr. Wade
and all his tribe of Blue Devils, riding on
the waves of two successive victories over
V. M. I. and Villanova, are on their way to
hand the Wildcats the worst licking they
could possibly receive. Slow music, please:
It may be so and we don’t know. Undoubt-
ed'y Duke has a strong team, and those
who saw the game say that their 13-0 vic-
tory over V. M. I. was scarcely an indica-
tion of their strength. This conclusion was
in some measure vindicated by ‘the machine-
like functioning of the Blue Devils against
Villanova last Saturday when they scored a!
decisive victory of 18-0.

May we point to our. 13-12 victory over
Duke in 1929 and our 7-6 victory over Caro-
lina in 1930 as evidences of the 'Cats’ ability
to upset the proverbial dope bucket? These
two teams were rated as leaders in the state
during the years mentioned, outweighing the
Davidson team considerably and possessing
reserves galore, but against them the Wild-
cats displayed a fighting spirit unparalled,
and a determination to win which was bound
to give results. 13-12 and 7-6. What. better
results could be desired?

Only a one point margin of victory, you
ask? Quit kickin’, “a beat s’a beat” as our
friend Doc Mathis laconically remarked.

“Tl jus’ don’t know suh, but if you jus’ keep

Charlie is right. If Davidson plays heads-up
football against Duke Saturday, taking ad-
vantage of the breaks and fighting the entire
game, the Blue Devils will go home draggin’

Wildkittens to Open

Clash With Wofford

Tomorrow afternoon the Wildkittens open
their football playing the Wofford

After numerous workouts with the varsity,
the boys under Coaches Unger and Laird have
been shifted quite a bit in order to find the
strongest backfield and line combinations. With
a second team rated as good as the first, the
matter of reserves should not bother the men-
tors.

Although this game will be the first venture
for the Freshmen this: year in football, it will
by no means be an easy one. Little is known
about the Wofford Terriers, but tradition shows
that they always put an outfit on the field that
gives a good account of itself,

Last year the Terriers and the Wildkittens
came off the gridiron with a 6-6 count, which
that the battle this year should have
some of the fight that would be expected from
dogs and cats. In 1929, the Davidson aspirants
of foothall who are now on the varsity squad
fared somewhat better than the hoys did ip
30. They came home with the long end of “aim

who bears the brunt of all miscalculations,

Here's something else to think about:

State 34-0. Carolina and Florida played to a

how much better than Davidson? Once
tangled in this type of figuring, the statisti-

But that’s neither here nor there. We'll

but battered Wildcat by running up three touch-
downs in the final canto to take the verdict
at 18-6. :

V. P. T., completely outclassed in the initial
half, rose to unexpected heights, and led by the
ubiquitous Al Casey, charged through the Da-
vidson team in the closing period to overcome
the 6-0 lead that the Wildcats had hung so
tenaciously to during the first three quarters.
Casey's cut-backs, and ma-
neuverings completely baffled the tired David-
son men, as he got away for a 49-yard totch-
down dash, and ran back

side-steps, other

punts in a manner
that brought the stands to their feet time and
time again.

pletely the master of the situation, holding the

twisting his way for a total of seventeen yards

by crushing the V line to shreds, and
on three successive plays to plant the ball in
scoring territory for the first touchdown of the
game. King failed to convert, leaving the score

6-0 in favor of Davidson

At the beginning of the second half the Gob-

blers with their hacks to the wall started an

attack in an effort to overcome the one-touch-
down lead of their smaller foe, and with Casey
doing most of the ball lugging, they had the
hall in the shadow of the Davidson goal as the
whistle sounded the end of the third quarter
