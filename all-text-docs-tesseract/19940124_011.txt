Santa brings the men's basketball team a great present

By Will Cobb

Davidson’s men’s basketball
program captured their first vic-
tory over an ACC opponent in over
a decade when they defeated
Clemson University in the Char-
lotte Coliseum during exams last
semester. The success has contin-
ued as the Wildcats went on to
upset NC State and East Tennes-
see State on the road. Along with
the big wins have come a couple of
tough losses as well to schools
such as The Citadel and Marshall.

Still, Davidson has proved that
this year’s squad is a serious con-

tender for the Southern Confer-
ence title, with a probable trip to
postseason play if the current suc-
cess continues. The overall record
now stands at 10-5 (4-4 Southern
Conference, 2-1 ACC).
Davidson 82 Clemson 79:

' After running out to 13 point
halftime lead, the Cats held off a
late surge from the Tigers to pre-
serve the victory. Sophomore
Brandon Williams had a career
best 28 points, hitting 5 of 8 at-
tempts from the three-point line
while leading the team with 6 re-

bounds. Another great perfor-
mance included senior Jason
Zimmerman, who hit 6 of 12shots,
including 5 three-pointers, finish-
ing with 21. With the Wildcats

having a height disadvantage, they _

shot from the outside, sinking 14
three-pointers as opposed to 12
regular field goals.

Marshall 75 Davidson 71:

The three game win streak
came to a halt at the hands of the
Thundering Herd in Davidson’s
first game in 11 days. After falling
behind by 10 at the half, the Cats
came back to take the lead with

7:19 remaining. But following two
consecutive Davidson timeouts,
Marshall put the game out of reach,
holding on for the upset. Williams
led the team with 20 points. Just as
the Cats beat Clemson with great
3-point shooting, the team shotonly
22% from the 3-point line in the
loss.
Davidson 64 NC State 63:
Davidson came ready to play
and the sharpshooting Janko Narat
buried the Wolfpack by hitting 7 of
10 field goal attempts while hitting
all nine free throws for a game high
24 points. Chris Alpert protected

the ball well while gathering 12
points and Jason Zimmerman put
forth an-excellent defensive effort,
leading the team with 8 rebounds.
Davidson 68 Western Carolina
64:

For the second game in a row,
Narat lead the Cats to victory with
24 points. George Spain added 18
points and Brandon Williams gath-
ered up a game high 13 rebounds
while scoring 8 points. Davidson
jumped out to a big lead, but was
not able to put the Catamounts

Swimming finishes third in meet with national programs

By David Dwyer

Davidson’s Swimming and
Diving teams faced an uphill battle
Saturday afternoon in facing Geor-
gia Southern and UNC-
Wilmington. Inmany of the swim-
ming events, Davidson swimmers
. found themselves outnumbered by
a heavy margin, often competing
against three or four members of
each opposing team.

Because swimming and div-
ing are basically individual com-
petitions, one might think that the
number of participants isn’t sig-
nificant — but in this case it is,
because it indicates the size of the
resources from which GS and
UNC-W could draw. Still,
Davidson, performed admirably,
notching at least a top five finish in
almost of the events they entered.

Leading the Davidson charge
was, as usual, sophomore Churchill
Hooff, who finished first in both
the men’s 500 and 1000M freestyle
and third in the 200M individual

medley. Freshman Michael Hart
stood out as Davidson’s top per-
former in the men’s 1M and 3M
diving, finishing second in both
categories.

On the women’s side, fresh-
man Suzanne Herring finished sec-
ond and first in the women’s 100
and 200M freestyle, respectively.
Sophomore Meg Bentley took third
place in the 3M diving competi-
tion to lead-her teammates. The
women’s relay team also made a
significant contribution, earning
second and third places in the 400M
medley and the 400M freestyle.

Overall, both Davidson teams
finished third of the meet’s three
contestants, though the margins of
defeat weren’t great: Davidson’s
men lost to Georgia Southern by
only 19 points and by 33 to UNCW,
who finished first overall.

Saturday’s meet was a chal-
lenge of the upstart versus the es-
tablished, and this time the upstart
felljust a bit short.

Cat Nips

By Tracy French

I love ACC basketball. For
those of you who don’t know me,
I am a die-hard Georgia Tech fan.
Being a yellow jacket makes it
often difficult to live in Tar-heel
and Blue Devil country. I have
watched some of the most thrilling
ACC battles from Alexander Me-
morial Coliseum (“The
Thrillerdome”). I have watched a
last second win over Duke in 1993
and aconvincing 1994 victory over
UNC (a great way to bring in the
New Year, I might add). I have
also seen, however, the jackets
completely destroyed by these two
teams as well as other members of
the ACC. Conference battles in
the ACC are the most intense in
college basketball. Can any col-
lege conference even come close
to ACC-type conference competi-
tion? No team is ever safe in the
ACC. No conference game is ever
easy.

The ACC is full of talented
players and coaches. I have never
seen a center as strong as Eric
Montross. He looks like a tree that
has staked his position in the ground
and seems tosay, “Excuse me while
I reach over your head and dunk
this basketball.” Joe Smith, the
phenomenal freshman center/for-
ward from the University of Mary-

land gets my vote for freshman of
the year. He is second in the ACC
in the scoring department averag-
ing 22.3 points a game. The ACC
has had and still has some of the
most amazing guards. Kenny
Anderson and Bobby Hurley are
two that come to mind because of
their assisting and scoring abili-
ties. (By the way, I wish Bobby
Hurley the quickest possible re-
covery). Randolph Childress, the
guard from Wake Forest, whose
scoring ability helped defeat Duke
last week, is leading the ACC in
scoring, averaging 22.7 points a
game. I cannot fail to mention Mr.
Versatility himself, Grant Hill. He
compliments an amazing Duke
starting line-up.

No one can argue against the
fact that the ACC has some of the
best coaches. Dean Smith—no
explanation is necessary. In my
opinion he is one of the best ever.
Coach K has also done extremely
well at Duke (No offense Duke
fans, but I am not even going to
attempt to spell his last name).
Coach K has a 405-177 record at
Duke with 2 National Champion-
ships. To this elite few I must add
Georgia Tech’s Bobby Cremins.
He’s not as good as Dean Smith or
Mike K..., but he is just so likeable.

The ACC is definitely the

The ACC: Quite simply the best there is

strongest basketball conference. In
the 93-94 preseason rankings, 4
ACC teams were ranked in the top
25. The ACC tops the list of con-
ferences with the most NBA play-
ers. The University of North Caro-
lina has the most active NBA play-
ers with 11 followed by Arkansas
and then two more ACC teams:
N.C. State with 9 and Georgia Tech
with 8.

Ilove ACC basketball. March
just would not be the same without
the Atlantic Coast Conference.
And, let’s not forget that our own
Davidson Wildcats posted two
important victories over Clemson
and N.C. State and lost,a close one
to Wake Forest. Way to go guys.
We have a near perfect record
against the toughest conference in
basketball.

Correction

Before Christmas, The
'Davidsonian ran a feature story
which incorrectly reported that
jsenior Garnett Smith is a music
major.

Instead, Smith is forming a
self-designed major in choral
conducting through the Center
for Interdisciplinary Studies.

The editors regret this mis-
take and wish to apologize.
