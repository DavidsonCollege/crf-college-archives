PERSONNEL OF THR “D MEN.

Howell, Captain, Left Tackle, Senior
Class—There hasn't been a player at

Davidson who has been a harder worker
or more consistent player than Howell.

He tor four years has been faithful on
the athletic battle ground, and for the

past three has won and well deserved

the “D" which he received. He hails

from Rockingharh, N.C, is. 160 in
weight, 5-11 in height. Captain How
ell’s. place will be hard to fill next year.

and all wish him as much success in’ his

future vocation as he has had on the
gridiron.

McKinnon, Captain-elect, Full Back.

Junior Class— Weight, 185; height, §
feet ii inches. “Big Mac” is a Geor-
gian from Brunswick, and this city
should be proud of him as indeed David-
son is. For two years he has been the
main factur in many victories that Dav
idson has won. His line plunge, his
punting, his defensive work, made him
the star of numerous ganies. His work
in the Lo of N.C. and U. of S.C.
games were great this Fall. As the pilot
of next Fall’s team, Davidson is count-
ing on him and has confidence that he
will make a good one.

Anderson, ‘Vackle, weight. 180; 6 feet
2 inches; Senior Class, Anderson, S. C.
For two vears he has been a power in
the line in many a hard game, It is
with regret that Davidson thinks of his
absence from his position nest Fall.

Van DeVanter. Guard ; weight, 175;
height, 5-11: Senior. “Van hac
dropped out for a year or so, and all
were glad to see him back this Fall. He
surely deserved the block «menogram
thar he received.

Crayton, Left End: weight, 176;
height, 6 feet ; Senior, Charlotte, N.C.
This is ‘Pete's’ fifth year of service on
the foot hall squad. Kor the past two
years he has been one of the most con-
sistent and valuable players on the team.
Davidson will lose a good player in
“Pete's” departure.

Walker. C. I... Half back ; weight,
172: height, 5-10. “Steve” is a South
Carolinian and comes from the Capital
city, Columbia. Before caming to Dav-
idson last Fall he went to Clemson,
where he made his block fetter on the
foot ball team. Both Last season and this
“Steve” has plaved a splendid game.

White, Center; weight. 173: height,
6-1 : Danielsville, Ga. Sdph. “This was
White’ $ first season as a regular, but he
has played like a veteran’ in all the
games this Fall. He played in’ every
single Varsity game, and during the en-
tire season did not have time taken out a
single time, nor was he out of the game
aominurte. Davidson is expecting great
things from him next Fall.

Keesler, Quarter; weight, 132: height,
5-6; Soph.; native of Greenwood, Miss.
Though the lightest man on the team,
Sam makes up in nerve and speed what
he lacks in weight.

Laird, Half Back; weight, 155:
height, 5-9; Soph. “Red” is another
Georgian, coming from Decatur. Be-
fore entering D. C. “Red” plaved for
several years on, Tech. High School's
Champion ‘Team. He played some great
ball this Fall, particularly in the U. of
S. C. game.

Black, Half Back; weight, 174:
height. 6-9; Concord, N.  C.; Fresh
Class. Last Fall Black was chief star
on “Bil” Fetzer’s Va. Prep. Champion
Team. He plaved an unusually fine
game this Fall in every single battle.
Along with him the squad had other col-
ors, as Grev and White. There was
also some Green material, but no “Yel-
low Streak.”

Walker, R., Right End; weight, 154;
height. 5-9. Another from Columbia.
He last Fall played on Clemson team.
He plaved fine game, especially in the
U. of S. C. and Wake Forest games.
He helones to the foot ball pair of
“Walker Bros.”

‘Kluttz, Lex., Manager season 1913
and also 1914; from Chester, S.C.

manager. He has been untiring in his
work for the Athletic Association. -

BA SKET BALL PROSPECTS.

Since the termination of beth the foot
ball and the class basket ball schedules
on ‘Thanksgiving, the number of candi-
dates for the Varsity. basker ball) rearn
has been more than doubled, and light
but regular practice hag been the order
of cach afternoon for the past week, An
ample indeer court has made it possibic
te continue regular practice despite the
unfavorable weather conditions.

With the inembers of last vear’s War
sity squad and much new material that
has been developed in the class games as
a nucleus, the coaches are endeavoring
to whip into line a formidable team to
represent: Davidson this year. Of last
vear'’s squad, McDonald, Carson, Reese.
Laird, and Somerville, have been show-
ing up well in’ practice, while Childs.
Howell, Walker, and Austin, from the
Freshman class, seem to be of Varsity
calibre.

A tentative schedule of games, which
is given below, has been arranged by
Manager McDonald. Although — the
contracts for these games have not been
signed by the several managers, yet it
is practically certain that only | slight
deviations will be made from the sched
ule as it is given below, wecept that six
more games will be added to it later in
the season.

Davidson will) play the following
teams at the following times and places:

Jan. 16—Charlotte Y. M. C. A. at
Davidson.

Jan. 2o——Wake Forest, at Wake For
est.

Jan. 21—Flon. at Elon.

fan. 28—Triniity. at Durham,

Tan. 23—A. & M., at Raleigh.
