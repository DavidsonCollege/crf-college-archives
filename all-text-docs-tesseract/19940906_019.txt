The Cardboard Village
& enrollment

By Leigh Rawdon

For only $1.50 a year, sub-
scribers to The Davidsonian from
1944 to 1953 kept up with a cam-
pus that not only looked differ-
ently than it does now, but also
thoughtand acted differently. Jack-
son Court was fraternity court.
Johnston Gym was only an
architect’s plan. Enrollment
dropped below 300. And, of
course, all of the students were
men. :
Sandwiched between two
wars, the decade between 1945
and 1953 witnessed a record low
enrollment. Of the 6400 living
alumni in the middle of 1945, 2380
were in the service; 130 of them
died.

After the second world war,
students returned to anearly-empty
campus. The only students during
the war were those physically un-
able to serve in the military or
those devoted to a career in minis-
try. In addition, men training for
the military were on campus until
the War Department withdrew the
last of their trainees in December
of 1944. Finally, “Davidson once
again became a civilian college,”
reads The Davidsonian of July 12,
1945.

The May 24, 1945 editorial
celebrated the end of the war:
“Davidson is already feeling the
effects of the victory in Europe.
Registration is increasing rapidly
and hopes that post-war improve-
ments will soon start seem evident
... As we have been told before, we
are seeing history being made, and
the opportunities which it gives us
must not be ignored. Davidson
joins the world in thanking God for
the victory He has given us and in
petitioning him to give us strength
for the tasks of the days which lie
ahead.”

Veterans of the war brought
their wives and children back to
Davidson to live in the “Cardboard
Village,” a housing complex
erected in 1946 by the Federal
Public Housing Authority. Fami-
lies laughed about the thin walls
and community-centered nature of
the village. Apparently, there were
very few secrets.

Just as soon as Davidson
calmed down after the world war,
‘drafts began again for the Korean
War. Once again, Davidson stu-
dents found themselves in the ser-
vice.

But the differences between -

the Davidson of yesterday and that
of today extend well beyond ap-
pearances or the circumstances of
the war. On first reading, how-
ever, the 30-year-old weekly news-
paper reveals many of the hot is-
sues of today: alcohol policies, the
relationship of the college with the
church, dating at Davidson, and
hazing, to name a few. The simi-
larities end there. The issues fos-
tered a student opinion that seems
to be in direct opposition to the
positions students hold today.
Alcohol Policies
On February 21, 1947, Jim

Love, the editor of The Davidso-
nian, wrote, “Relatively speaking,
Davidson is still one of the last
monuments to dances and social
functions when people have a bet-
ter time than at other schools and
do so without the aid of intoxi-
cants. Anyone who says it can’t be
done is wrong.” He continues to
explain the ills of drinking, saying,
“Where is all of this [drinking]
leading? Well, it cracked the
mighty Roman Empire, and it will
just as certainly crack us if we as
individuals do not do something
about it.”
Dating at Davidson
Despite being an all-male

_ school, Davidson students still

managed to meet and date women.
Throughout the post-war decade,
Davidson had mixers with Queens,
Converse, and Salem. The Faculty
Social Committee even voted to
allow Midwinters dates to sleep in
Duke Dorm during the 1945 fes-
tivity.

Apparently housing had al-
ways posed such a problem that
the faculty required that beginning
in 1945, every dance be held on
campus with the dates staying ina
dorm. Until then, dances were not
permitted on campus.

Besides Midwinters, the
Spring Frolics, fall formals, and
homecoming were the social week-
ends that covered the front page of
The Davidsonian for weeks before
and after the event occurred. Other
big days included “Q-D” day, when
Queens and Davidson students
socialized, or other days that hosted
women’s colleges.

In February of 1948, a front
page headline read, “Salem Beau-
ties Schedule Party.” The writer
encouraged his friends to sign up
in the lobby of Chambers immedi-
ately “in order that they might have
dates.”

Religion
There are two glaring signs of

the difference in attitudes toward

religion between the Davidson of

today and that of yesterday. First,
every editor in this decade felt the
need to write at least one, if not
five, editorials about the proper
behavior during chapel assemblies.

The second sign appears in
the following listof headlines found
in the issue of The Davidsonian

‘printed February 21, 1947:
- “Westminster Group Offers Dis-

cussions Every Sunday Night,”
“Story’s Class Proves Active,
Gives Bibles,” “Duke Fellowship
Adds Ideas: Davidson Christian
Fellowship Gains New Leaders,”
“Your Hall Prayer Meetings Can
Prove to Be of Value,” and lastly,
“What if Jesus asked you for ad-
vice?”
Hazing

One of the traditions of
Davidson, a tradition that many
students feltneeded defending and
encouraging, involved the defer-
ence of freshmen to the upper-
classmen. The issue of The David-
sonian printed September 9, 1949
warned the new students of their
appropriate position with a front
page -headline: “So You Think
You Are a Davidson Man; You
Are Only Frederick the Freshman.”

The upperclass focused on
using any means to make the fresh-
men behave according to the regu-
lations. If not, the Court of Con-
trol, whose presiding judge was
elected each year and featured on
the front page of the newspaper,
had the duties “to hear, investi-
gate, and deal with the charges of
upperclassmen against freshmen
of improper conduct, violating
freshmen regulations, or breaking
college traditions.” ;

The Court of Control punished
one freshmen for walking on the
grass with copying the regulations
25 times. On October 18, 1946,
the headline read, “Obnoxious
Freshmen Sentenced at Court.”

Post
World War
Davidson

World War II was in full swing when I arrived at Davidson in
June, 1943. Enrollment at the College was small, having dropped
to fewer than one hundred students at one time. Also, there were
military cadets on campus then, and they were housed in East and
West Dorms. We had little interaction except for one confrontation
that was amicably resolved. With lights out at 10 p.m. they arose
early and would count off and sing loudly as they marched to
breakfast, waking the rest of us living in Rumple, Watts and
Georgia. Once, I repeatedly played reveille on my cornet at
midnight in front of their dorm. This drew profane cries from their
windows and resulted in a meeting with the commanding officer,

’ after which the cadets marched to breakfast in silence and I put my

horn away at night. Chemistry was my major and after graduating
in May, 1946, I accepted a position as Instructor at Davidson. This
postponed for one year my appointment to a graduate assistantship
at the University of North Carolina. Many veterans returned to
Davidson in ’45-’46, and one was elected president of the student
body. He informed me that student government by-laws called for

_ the election of an editor of The Davidsonian, instead of being

appointed which had happened to me. Twice weekly, time was
allotted at the required daily chapel services to conduct business.
At one such meeting, I was nominated and elected without oppo-
sition as the first post-World War II Editor-in-Chief of The David-
sonian. After receiving my doctorate degree in 1952, I ‘was
appointed Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Bucknell University
where, presently, I am Professor Emeritus and live in Lewisburg,

‘Pennsylvania. -
