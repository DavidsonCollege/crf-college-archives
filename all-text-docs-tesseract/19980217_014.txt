It’s the people that make the place.

That has been Bobby Vagt’s credo since
taking office as Davidson’s 16th president some
seven months ago. So in making a swift half
dozen personnel changes — or eliminations —
over the past two weeks, :
has he broken a promise?

Lt. Emory McLaurin
thinks so.

“I remember all that
‘It'sa family thing’ and this,
that, and the other,” said
McLaurin, who was fired
from his position as detec-
tive for the campus police.
“There are areas they could
have cut back on before they
did what they did.

“I’m sure there are
things they could have cut
before personnel and the
safety of the students.”

In particular,
McLaurin points to the el-
evator recently built in the
president’s house as an un-
necessary and extravagant
expenditure.

“Why do they need to put an elevator in
President Vagt’s house?” McLaurin asked in a
telephone interview from his home in Mooresville
on Thursday evening. “Yes, I’m PO’d because I
lost my job, but why does he need that elevator?
He doesn’t look that much older than me.”

Ultimately, McLaurin believes the safety of
students is being compromised because of these
recent developments.

McLaurin has questions,
but no answers

“They don’t have anybody looking after
investigations anymore,” he said. “One man
can’tdoitall, and that’s basically what they want.
It’s impossible.

“Maybe some cuts are necessary, but you’re
talking about the safety of the students here.”

McLaurin, as will the others who have been
directly effected by the budget cuts, will pick up
the pieces and move on.
With the help of the school,
McLaurin is putting to-
gether a resume and will
send out completed appli-
cations in coming weeks.

Even so,
McLaurin said, “I sacrificed
my family for that job. I
loved my job at Davidson

up in the morning and go-
ing to work.

“It’s going to be
hard to replace that. It’s
going to have to be a damn
good job.”

But McLaurin
leaves Davidson waiting for
an explanation that: will
likely.never come.

“IT was in total
shock,” McLaurin said, re-
ferring to the meeting in Dean of Students Tom
Shandley’s office two weeks ago, at which he
was told his job was being eliminated. “I’m still
in shock. I don’t understand why.”

And why was the police department singled
out to seemingly bear the brunt of the financial
cutbacks?

Said McLaurin, “I guess you'll have to ask
President Vagt that.”

At the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies,
Ruth Ann Swart is the mother, and the 28 majors
are her children.

Swart, the department assistant, makes lunch
for the students and their faculty advisers every
Friday. If a bleary-eyed student is staring at a late
night in the Center, she leaves a pillow and a

‘blanket.

“She brings us all together,” said Samia
Mohammed, a junior Center ;
major. “We know her so
well and she knows us so
well. She’s part of our fam-
ily.”

But due to the College’s
recent round of personnel
cutbacks, Swart, who had
been a full-time employee’
for five years, will have to do
that ona part-time basis from
now on.

She had her hours re-

week for 10 months of the
year to 20 hours for nine
months. With those hours
went her benefits, including
health insurance.

“For me, it’s been my
family,” Swart said last week
from her Mooresville home.
“Part of the Center’s atmo-
sphere is to provide a home for the kids. I think our
kids are the best of the best, and they need a special
place.

“It’s a terrible decision,” she said of Presi-
dent Bobby Vagt’s layoffs. “It’s wrong, just plain
wrong.”

“Ruth Ann means a great deal to me, person-
ally and professionally,” said Bob Manning, the
Director of the Center. “She is a wonderful and

Swart held Center together

@ Ruth Ann Swart

loving person.”

Who’s going to do the work Swart once did?

“Me,” Manning said bluntly.

Is it going to affect the productivity of the
Center?

“Yep.”

Said Swart: “I feel like it’s a kick in the face
of Dr. Manning —to feel like his department is not
important.”

But for Swart, this situation goes far beyond
one particular department. As a child growing up
in North Carolina, Davidson was “the hallowed

place to go to school — and
it was trustworthy.”
; And now?

“My faith in’
Davidson has just dropped
to the ground,” she replied.
“T didn’t think they would
treat me like this.”

And Swart points
to Vagt the businessman as
the prime culprit.

“T think he’s used
to acorporate life,” she said.
“In the corporate world, there
is no family. It’s the bottom
line that matters.

“I don’t think he
even considered the people
involved. I’ve never talked
to him. He doesn’t know
that I exist. It hurts so much.
It’s just like now I’m not
important. So I take that

very personally.”

Swart pointed out an interesting parallel be-
tween Vagt’s family and the Center: Both are run
by a Robert and a Ruth Ann — Bob and Ruth Ann
inthe Center, Bobby and Ruth Annatthe president's
house.

“I thought he would have realized that,”
Swart said. “But I guess he was just too busy doing
what he does to form personal relationships.”
