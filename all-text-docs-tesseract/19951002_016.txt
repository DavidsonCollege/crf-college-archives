prove from their respective perfor-
mances last weekend at Delaware.

The women got off to a good
start with an excellent performance
from freshman Suzy Burr. She fin-
ished third overall with a time that
was fast enough to seta new school
record for the woman’s 5 km race.
Her time was 18 minutes 25 sec-
onds, which bettered the old mark
by 20 seconds.

The Wildcats got more help
from freshmen as four of their five
scoring positions were taken by
freshmen. Janet Aardema (20:46)

was Davidson’s second runner, fol-

lowed by senior Katie McKelvie
(20:47), and freshmen Kelly Kiefer
(21:05) and Beth Brewster (21:27).

Overall, the women’s squad
finished seventh out of 13 teams,
and coach Bill Drake said he was
very pleased with the Wildcats
performance.

Men’s coach Gary Andrew
was equally pleased with his team

Burr sets school record

as it took 10th place at the 18-team
event. “This is our best race to
date,” Andrew said. “The guys
were more competitive today.
People went out and raced.”

Sophomore Josh Cookson led
a team which saw six of its nine
runners achieve personal bests for
an 8 km course. Cookson placed
14th out of 116 finishers with a
time of 26:35. Dave Foss (27:33),
Tripp Franklin (27:59), Jonathan
Fly (28:23) and Tim O’Keefe
(28:33) rounded out the top five
for the Wildcats.

“We raced well as a team to-

day,” Foss said. “If we continue to
improve, we will be primed for
conference.”
Both teams will be off for fall
break weekend. Look for faster
times, however, intwo weeks when
Davidson travels to Charlotte for
the North Carolina Intercollegiate
Championships in McAlpine Park
on October 14.

Close one

Wildcats are disappointed to be 1-
3. But things will only get better
from here on out, as Davidson has
already faced the two top teams in
Emory & Henry and Guilford.
The squad improves weekly

and has demonstrated it is capable
of competing with the powerhouses
on their schedule: The obvious next
step for the club is to transform
those close losses into wins, par-
tially by eliminating little, but im-
portant, mistakes.

Landis is confident his team
will do that, saying, “It doesn’t
take a rocket scientist to realize
that the future of football here is
very bright.”
