Council Hears Dean
Discuss Flu Situation

The Student Council met with Dean Pietenpol

announced today.

Following the cancellation by
Presbyterian of the scheduled
Homecoming game because of
the flu epidemic at P.C., the
Davidson coaching staff set
about immediately to find a
suitable opponent.

Coach Dole secured the
permission of Acting Presi-
dent Pietenpol to seek a foe
for the game. Requests were
sent out early yesterday
evening via radio, tele-
vision, and newspaper serv-
ices for any teams which
might be able to fill, the
gap in the schedule to con-
tact Davidson at once.

Elon officials contacted the
local office today that - they
would be able to play the Wild-
eats, as their scheduled game
with Catawba had been can-
celled.

FOUR WINS

Stauffenberg, who they
claim is the best in the
state.

Coach Bill Dole, commenting
on the prospects of the game,
noted that it would be much
better than the match with
Presbyterian would have been,
as the Wildcats will be facing
one of the top teams in the
North State Conference.

Hall To Preach On
Reformation Day

A special Reformation serv-
ice will be conducted during
Vespers this Sunday. The
Reverend B. Frank Hall, rector
