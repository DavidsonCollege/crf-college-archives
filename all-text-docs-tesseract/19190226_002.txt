Vhe magazine has been a lame sib-
ject for several years, Somehow it has
not received the interest and support the
other publications have been accorded by
the student body, and asa cohsequence
has depended on the svark of wa sinall
group of} men each. sadccessive yehr tor
existence. (Since it has been taken out ot
the hands of the Literary Societies and
nade a student body institution, it has
been hard put to it tor subsistence, finan
cial and literary.

Any man who will took at it from an
impartial point of yiew must admit that
a magazine is necessary to an all round
college. You may smile, but it is a fact
that there ought ta be some channel thru
which those buvs who are interested mav
give vent to the expression of their lit-
erary ability, ot whatever degree it may
he. and thru which they may develop
themselves in that line, if they so desire.

A number of solytions’ have been of-
fered which would strengthen the maga-
zine, but probably the best is. to put it
under the care of the Junior Class, just
as the Annual is under the care of the
Senior class. A’ class would clect its
editor and manager in the spring. of
their Soph year, who would take charge

leges. observe this custom with marked
success, and it is reasonable. to believe
that it could be done at Davidson with
equal success.

Several Years.

All are much interested in the com-
mandant of the R. OT. C.. Licutenant-
Colonel Mueller. Kor information about
his past military experience he has been
kind cnough to submit the following:
He entered West Point as a cadet
June 17, 1897, and graduated and was
honorably discharged June 7, 1901. He
was a private, then a corporal in ‘Vroop
Gi. Second Cavalry, Mareh §. 1902 to

second lieutenant October 17 and ac-
cepted his commission Octuber 26, 1902.

He served in the Philippine Islands,

iyti to tgtyg inclusive, His first lieu-
renant’s commission was accepted Marelr

‘and was made lentenant-colonel Aagust

with the Eighth Cavalry from Decem-
her, 1902. to October, ryog. and was
with the “Venth Cavalry: at Fort Haia-
chuca, Noco, Ariz. during 1915. So
mostcof his experience has been’ with
that branch rather than intantn.

From January 1910, to faly, 1918,
he was con genernl recruiting service in
Colorado, and. sceved with the Seventh
Cavalry fram. Jidy 1 te August 10.
1018, On August 18. 1978. he was as-
