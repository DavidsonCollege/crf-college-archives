Palestinian riots continue; Ortmayer will run for President

By mATERINE PRICE

Headlining the news January 7-14:

Violence continues in the Israeli-dccu- |

pied territories, where approximately thirty
Palestinians have been killed since Decem-
ber. The Israeli Army has cracked down on
the unrest, but political solutions to the
problems recently have been suggested.
Israeli Prime Minister Shamir insists on
retaining Israeli sovereignty over the terri-
tories, which Israel has occupied since
1967.

A West German woman, Christina Gab-
riele Endrigkeit; was arrested on Monday
for allegedly planting the bomb in a.West
Berlin discotheque that led to the U.S. air
raidon Libya last April. U.S. officials insist
that there was a Libyan connection to the
bombing. .

Japanese Prime Minister Noburo Take-
. Shita will visit Washington this week.
Trade issues will be the major focus of
discussions between Takeshita and U.S.
_ Officials. The U.S. suffers from a severe

trade imbalance with Japan, whose imports
into the U.S. haveraised cries for protection

from domestic industries.

The U.S.S.R. has indicated that a with-
drawal of its troops from Afghanistan could
begin as soon as May 1. The Communist
Party newspaper Pravda emphasized that
the timetable for withdrawal depended on
significant reduction of U.S. and Pakistin-
ian aid for the mujahedin rebel forces in
Afghanistan.

In addition, the U.S.S.R. suggested a
summit meeting between Soviet leader
Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xi-
aoping.. The Chinese have cited the prob-
lems of Cambodia as the major obstacle to
a Sino-Soviet summit.

In Nicaragua, 10,000 people participated
in an anti-government demonstration hon-
oring the tenth anniversary of the death of
newspaper publisher Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro. Chamorro was a strong critic of
Anastasio Somoza.

And in Davidson...
Inamove that may place our beloved, yet

somewhat obscure, Davidson in the na-’
tional spotlight, Dr. Lou Ortmayer an-
nounced his candidacy for the Democratic
presidential nomination. Ortmayer made

his announcementata meeting of the Politi-

cal Science Senior Colloquium, a required
course for Political Science majors. Collo-
quium students will serve Ortmayer as
campaign advisers.

Ortmayer’s campaign platform stresses
strong support for the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces treaty, as well as for the Arias Cen-
tral American peace plan. Ortmayer would
like tocut the defense budgetand reduce the
deficit by $30 billion. He supports a na-
tional sales tax of 5%, and would like to
concentrate on public works and education.

The Democratic campaign, which ap-
peared to have no front-runner until Gary
Hart reentered the race, is far from decided.
Many observers attribute Hart’s lead to
name recognition from his affair. with
Donna Rice, which led to his earlier with-
drawal. While Ortmayer’s attempt to cap-
ture the Democratic nomination may be

something of a long-shot, stranger things
have happened. Of particular importance
to the campaign will be candidate perform-
ances during the Iowa caucuses and the
New Hampshire primary.

Campus reaction to Ortmayer’s cam-
paign has been mixed:
“Ortmayer’ s candidacy has my unqualified
support.”
“hope that he uses his political cartoons to
gain an advantage over his campaign oppo-
nents.”
“I want him to ‘fess up about the skeletons
in his closet.”
“Ortmayer’s election to the presidency
would if nothing else stimulate the cause of
feminism, since if he follows his usual
patterns, his cabinet will be at least 80%
female, Further, the White House tennis
courts will be transformed into world-class
volleyball courts.”

Those students and/or fans desiring to
participate in the campaign are urged to
contact Dr. Ortmayer.
