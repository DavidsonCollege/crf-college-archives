COMMUNITY BIKES GATHER DUST: A NEW ERA
OF COLLECTIVE TRANSPORTATION IS BORN

Based off a proposal by self-
labeled “worldly students” living
in the newly renovated Duke
Dormitory, Davidson College stu-
dents are no longer limited to the
somewhat archaic form of trans-
portation known as “the bicycle.”
Receiving a Dean Rusk Grant for
$12,000, the group argued in
Clause 2 of its proposal that there
“sadly is not enough communal
transportative diversity on cam-
pus.”

Spokesman Gene Tenace '11
stated, “It would be wrong to

to ride a bicycle and we just want-
ed to make sure that everyone feels
at home at Davidson. I never

! learned how to ride a bike when I
| was younger, so the new communi-

ty bikes equipped with training
wheels were just what I needed to
get that extra boost.”

Additionally, razor scooters,
skateboards, water tricycles, pogo
sticks and those shoes with the
wheels in them have been added to
the school's collection of forms of
community transportation. The last
addition to the new line of trans-
portation vehicles were the affec-
tionately named “communicycles.”
Unlike many other modes of trans-
portation, the community unicycles
remain in very good condition
except for their occasional use by
the Barnum and Bailey trainees

who conduct a joint practice with
circus-oriented students in the atri-
um of the Union once a week.

Steve Hassiter and longtime girl-
Friend Susie McNutte use the com-
munal water tricycle at the Lake
Campus on Saturday.

Junior Bilford Wilkins remarked,
“Those guys are pretty weird, and
by pretty weird I mean really
weird. One time after they were
done riding the communicycles in
the atrium, I saw a few of them
start juggling human
femurs...yeah, I know, weird.”

Will Beauford '09 commented on
his adoration for one new addition
in particular. “I just love when I
find a pair of rollie-shoes outside
of Commons and I'm in a hurry to
get to class. I just slip 'em on and
instantly I am a fashionable rolling
man-machine.”

However, a few initial problems
have emerged and in certain situa-
tions the results have been some-
what serious. Ecstatic about the

Watergate Secrets Actually
Leaked in Library Antechamber

Washington, D.C.—In an
attempt to achieve greater trans-
parency with the public, Pentagon
officials have confirmed that the
Watergate scandal was actually
leaked in the E.H. Little Library
antechamber. A curious architec-
tural fluke in the Little Library’s
antechamber actually allows sound
to travel perfectly to the second
floor, officials said.

They have also admitted that the
mysterious information source
“Deep Throat” was actually not
Deputy Director of the FBI Mark
Feld Sr. but rather a then junior
Davidson Economics major Marty
Winkerstein now in real estate.

On May 4, 1972, while studying
for his econometrics final on the
second floor of the library, Marty
overheard a conversation between
White House Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldemann and presidential advi-
sor John Erlichmann.

“I was just crunching numbers
when all of a sudden I hear these
guys whispering about wire-tap-

ping, political espionage and some

Mexican slush fund,” Winkerstein
said. “At first I made nothing of it,
but after those guys broke into the
Watergate building a month or so
later, well, I just put two and two
together and called my buddies at
the Washington Post.”

Winkerstein admitted he had
thought about leaking the secrets to
The Davidsonian, but felt that he
would receive better incentives and
more reliable witness protection
from the Post.

What the two Nixon Staff mem-
bers were doing on campus is yet
to be disclosed.

Perhaps the most curious aspect
of the scandal is that most students
have yet to realize this architectur-
al flaw and are still making today
the mistake Haldemann and
Erlichmann made 35 years ago.

“T couldn’t believe it, but when I
was back on campus last week, just
perusing some books in the Stacks
section, up drifts this girl’s voice
going on and on about how many
times she had cheated on her
boyfriend. Really remarkable.”

Hambleton Clemens bounced into
Vail Commons during the lunch
rush that follows the end of 11:30
classes. As he bounced, his
momentum carried him further
than he anticipated, causing one of
his shoelaces to become coiled in
the pogo spring. This led to him
tumbling in an L-shaped pattern
down both sets of stairs while
simultaneously creating a devastat-
ing human domino effect.

Jack Wiles‘10 “pogos” acriss
Chambers lawn early Monday ~
morning.

When the dust settled, seven
were wounded and Clemens was
issued a Code of Responsibility
violation.

In a similarly troubling situation,
one of the giant water tricycles
intended for community use at the
Lake Campus was apparently ped-
aled back onto the main campus,
then taken onto I-77 where they
left it on the side of the road. It
was towed within a couple of

hours.

The student responsible for this
series of events wished to remain
anonymous but issued a statement
defending his actions: “J was hun-
gry for Wendy's and those big
wheels are really tiring to pedal
after a while, so I walked the rest of
the way. I also do not have a car on
campus so J really didn't have a
choice. Therefore, I firmly believe
I should not have to pay for the
towing fees since the appropriate
terrain of each community vehicle
is not directly specified in the Use

of Communal Transportation
agreement.” ,
“The last addition to the

new line of transporta-
tion vehicles were the
affectionately named
“communicyeles.”

Although the transportation
vehicles themselves will not
improve the diversity statistics
published by the Admissions
office, College officials are confi-
dent that the new modes of com-
munity transportation will attract a
wider range of applicants to the
College.

An Interview with

Homecoming King Michael XI

Yowl: Your Majesty, your consent
to be interviewed by us, mere
fiefs, is truly noble.

King: A monarch must never
overlook even his lowliest sub-
jects.

Yowl: Of course, my liege. Are
you still living in Flowe?

King: Only for another fortnight.
We are having a 17th century
Hanoverian Schloss imported and
reconstructed behind Baker Sports
Complex that should be finished
within the year.

Yowl: Will you continue to sum-
mer in Mallorca?

King: We will summer at Armor
Street.

Yowl: Do you really hold court at
Commons?

King: Yes, but what a serfish
name for a great hall. I have rid
it of peasants and warned them
about hunting and playing “fris-
bee” on our grounds. I also hold
court at “The Court,” though I
have thus far been unable to sire
an heir.

Yowl: Are you still planning a

crusade to Appalachian State?
King: Perhaps, though I fear what
will happen in my absence.

Yowl: Is there an evil regent bid-
ing his time?
King: Sadly, yes.
er, Prince Dudlee.
Yowl: Something is rotten in the
state of Denmark...

King: What?

Yow!l: What are your duties as
Homecoming King?

King: Well, aside from hunting
stag and playing battleships
against my grand vizeer, very lit-
tle. It’s actually sort of a puppet
monarchy. Most of the real
power is vested in senators and
Deans.

Yowl: When is your coronation?
King: Thursday at 7:00 in DCPC.
My roving monsignors should
have notified all subjects of that
by now.

Yowl: What did you think of the
Homecoming game?

King: It was the most fun I’ve had
since we butchered those infidels
from Woffard.

My step-broth-
