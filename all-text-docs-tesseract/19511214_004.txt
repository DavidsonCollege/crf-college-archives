ROTC Deferments
Explained Fully

A recent bulletin from Washington pertains to all ROTC
students now under the deferment agreement or planning to
sign. It adds a new condition to the terms of the old agreement.

Before the new provision, the
deferment agreement stated that the
student promised (1) to take the ad-
vanced course if selected or com-
plete it if enrolled (2) to accept a
commission in the ORC if tendered
and (3) to serve at least two years
on active duty if called by the
Secretary of the Army, but only if

called.
In return the Government

promised to leave the student in
college and to keep him free from
the draft as long as he is enrolled
in the ROTC and is under the de-
ferment.

A student is technically enrolled
in the ROTC for 120 credit hours
at college provided he meets the
other requirements of his military
science work,

The new agreement requires the
above plus the additional stipu-
lation that the student (if offered
a commission) will keep his com-
mission for eight years as a reserve
officer. ‘

He may be subject to call to
two years’ active duty by the Sec-
retary of the Army at any time
within those eight years.

Freshmen who sign deferments
must sign the new agreements
since they were not considered for
selection ty the quota list until after
the new law was passed.

If a man now enrolled in the ad-
vance course. fails to sign the new
agreement who has previously
signed an agreement, he will go on
a status of temporary deferment,
under the provisions of former reg-
ulations, pending clarification of the

Scouts Join
Service Frat

Alpha Phi Omega, a_ national
service fraternity, had. its kick off
meeting on the Davidson campus
on December §, at which time
Earnest McCutchan was elected
temporary president of the group.
Fred Allen was chosen as secretary
for the fraternity which is the most
recent on the campus.

The first meeting was occupied
with the problems of establishing
an organization, but realizing that
they needed to have some project
before Christmas, the members of
the young fraternity joined with the
scout committee of the YMCA Cab-
inet in having a Christmas party
at Erwin Lodge for the two newly
formed Negro scout troops in this
area,

trees. The main issue is whether or
not it is right to exclude from our
opportunities and company another

human being.

With the Court of Control the
line of thought is different.
Let me say that this in no way

reflects on Johnny Guiton and his
boys, They have done the finest
job with the Court that has been
done since I have been here, The
Court has only one reason for
existing. This reason is to help the
freshmen to get off to the proper
start in college, and to instill the
Davidson Spirit in them. We as-
sume, by the very existence of the
Court, that the average freshman
who comes here will need advice.
I agree, but I think there is a bet-
ter way to give him this advice
than through the Court. If we would
treat him like what we want him to
become, instead of what we want
him- not to become, I think we
would come a lot closer to our goal.
Let’s treat him as a mature in-
dividual whenever possible. As for
the advice part, if I were a fresh-
man again |. would much rather
some upperclassman or group of
upperclassmen come to me and talk
to me privately .because they were
intrested in me personally. We duck
this responsibility by creating a
Court. I think the Freshman Ad-
visor should asstume a large part
of this responsibility, or at least be
on the Court to fulfill this task. The
matter of instilling school spirit ap-
pears in the next paragraph,

Someone once said that
school spirit is like a lady's vir-
tue: you don’t begin to suspect
it until someone talks about it
This is true for the “Davidson
Spirit.” I believe most of the
talk about it is really an at-
tempt to prove the existence of
something that doesn't exist,
and we are ashamed to admit
it. Let's face facts. We don't
have much school spirit.
Brother Daniels says all we have

to do is to win more ball games.
This is probably true, but he has
missed the point entirely. 1 would
like to see a school spirit around
here that js vibrant Whether we
win or lose. We should be proud of
the boys who represent us, because
we know they want to play, and
are doing their best. Victory comes

third more accidents, the Salisbury
road has four times as many
speeding arrests. It was concluded
by authorities that the majority of
accidents were caused by speeding
on the Salisbury road indicating
that the major portion of the Da-
vidson highway accidents were duc
to other causes such as the condi-
tion of the road itself.

Road factors which greatly in-
fluence traffic accidents are curves,
road surfaces and the condition of
the shoulders.

On the narrow Davidson rvad,
it was found that most of the
curves are banked according to
seemingly outmoded ehgineer-
ing patterns. Indeed 13 acci-
dents have been recorded this
year in the immediate vicinity
of these “wrong-way” curves.
Advertising, weeds, and other ob-

stacles obstruct the vision of the
driver on these curves.

Possibly the worst condition
of all is the softness of the
shoulders. As, the road is only
18 feet wide, when it becomes
necessary to leave the road and
go onto the shoulder, the soft
clay composition of the should-
er makes driving difficult.

It is thought that these shoulders
are the cause of accidents by police
ofiicials.
in how you play, not in what the
score is, Maybe the answer is in
dropping down to a league con-
sistent with our size and strength.
TI feel pretty sure that we are using
poor psychology in making the
freshmen cheer. They should catch
the spirit from us, and if we don't
have the spirit, then we don’t have
any right to punish a freshman for
not having it.

Well, this has gone. on long

S. I: Out with it, men. What's
the beef? College Man: Saint Peter,
if you don’t mind, sir, I'd like to
get inside and get cleaned up be-
fore manna. But this . . . rabble
here keeps insisting that he merits

precedence because he died first.|. .

Which, incidentally, would make
him the millionth traffic fatality in
the United States. Of course, sir,
from what I can see through the
gate, you people don’t hold much
honors up here, do you? But, re-
turning to the point, I'm sure I
died first, and T must be right. You
see, I'm almost through college.
‘(Turns back to college man) Now,
back to you, young’un. Disregard-
ing this millionth fatality trash,
what makes you think you can get
in just because you went to col-
lege? C.M.: Oh, excuse me, sir.
T don't blame you for misunder-
standing. You see, I was at a
church college, not a university.
Here's my YMCA card, sir.
(Gabriel slaps knee, bursts in>
to roar of laughter, rolls on
cloud, completely overcome
with his hilarity.)

S.P.: (aside) Guess the Boss was
right, after all. C.M.: What's that?
S.P.: Oh, nothing. Sit down; we'll
be back to you later. And now,
I want to hear your side of the
story, Mr....uh... Bum: Nuckles.
S.P: Yes, thats it. Nuckles, Nuckles
. of course, I should've known.
What's your story? Bum: Y’sce,

nin’ on ‘is corner, y’ see, minnin’

shoulders) And den, awlva suddin,

That’s enough. You forget that I
knew it all before you came. Archie,
Triple-Tongue, have you anything
to say before I tell these men
where to go?

Arch and Gabriel: (together) No,
Fellows, you know I'd like to help
you, But it’s no secret what the
trustees can do to those who keep
on sinning after they get up here.
Now you, young’un, are a college
man. Bum: That's a sin, m’lud.
S.P.: I'm inclined to agree with
you, friend. However, Nuckles, you
have doubted the authority of a

college man. Goodness knows that's
a sin. C.M.: Sir, does that mean

it does. Bum (to college man) That

sides from laughter). S.P.: Just a

Man turn back. Saint Peter puts
feet up on desk.) As for that mil-
lionth fatality rot, like the College
Man said, you all’s earth titles don’t
hold much up here; I’m not even
interested enough to check and see
who did die first. In fact, the title
will have done all the good it can
do if it reminds those you left be-
hind on the highways to take their
time about making the trip up here.
There’s no need to hurry. Pshaw,
