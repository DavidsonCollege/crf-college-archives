The handball courts are even more crowded, not ac-
comodating more than 12 players at one time.

Hard surface tennis courts still aren’t here, so there
is no tennis playing during the mild weather of the winter
months.

Basketball and handball are the only sports available
to students in the winter, and the facilities for these sports
are sadly lacking. Tennis is a possibility for another win-
ter sport, yet winter facilities for this sport are non-
existent.

Athletic Director Tom Scott points out that there is
peed of room at rear of the gymnasium to build an
addition containing a double basketball court, three more
handball courts, and a new weight room.

Davidson may be tops academically, but it won't be
the superior school it aspires to be until it’s athletic faci-

there won’t be any need for an athletic plant—just more

SURPRISE

The freshman-sophomore basketball game last night
was a source of amazement to just about everyone—
everybody expected the much publicized and highly sub-
sidized war baby team to cream the sophs. But it wasn’t

that way.

Their effort was really fantastic. The frosh had about
five inches per man in height advantage and a big edge in
individual talent, but the sophomores stuck with them to

the end.

Tucker Laxton was perhaps the biggest surprise and
the most outstanding performer on the court. He was the
th 25 tallies, and was everywhere on
an amazing rebounding job against the

The Sigma Nu’s pulled off the
surprise of the week in IMAC
flickerball by taking the Phi
Delts in a tight defensive battle,
6-0. But those who saw this game
will agree that this was no
mere accident. The Nu boss and
tailback, Rick Phitzner, to-
gether with a spirited team,
pulled together a set of machine
like plays that stunned their op
ponent.

The first few minutes of the
game saw the ball exchanged
many times, neither team being

able to pressure the other. But
about the fourth time the Delts
had possession of the ball, they
drove within the 18-yard marker
before being stopped by the Nu
defense. Play was nearly even
until John Mason, a key figure
in the Nu lineup, intercepted a
Delt pass. Then began a series

App Booters Score Late
To Edge Davidson 3-2

Exhaustion may have been a factor inthe Wildcat soccer team’s 3-2 loss to Ap-
elaborated, “Yeah, we should have won. We have
tter scoring and a better defense, but on that particular day, they were better than

alachian Wednesday.

we were.
“The team played well a-
gainst Appalachian. In fact,

I would say that we dominated
the game. We made a couple
of mistakes in the third quar-
ter, and they took advantage
of them.”

The game was played under
terrible conditions. Heavy rains
had turned the field at Boone
into a virtual sea of mud. Con-
sequently, both teams had
trouble moving the ball.

Davidson scored first on a
penalty shot by Jan Brakel
late in the first quarter. The
Wildcats continued to control
the ball and scored again in
the second quarter when Lewis
Foss sliced the ball in from left
wing.

Appalachian came roaring
back in the third quarter and
scored three quick goals. The
first of these was on a power
play up the middle, with a half-
back making the scoring kick,
Their second and third goals
came in the same way, but be-
cause of heavy traffic in front
of the net, their halfback didn’t
have a clear kick and was fore-
ed to push the ball in. Neither
team seriously threatened in
the fourth quarter, although
{Davidson controlled the ball
most of the time.

Davidson played without
their number one and number
two goalies, which certainly

made a dent in the defense.

Despite the loss, Fogleman
was quite impressed with
several individual performances.
“George Nzongola and George
Brown played well at the half-

back positions. Gus Brown and
Will Edmunds played extreme
ly good defense as fullbacks.’

Forward Lee Fanning talked
briefly of the loss and then
of the upcoming game with
Oglethorpe.” We didn't hustle
enough. They had two fast for-
wards who outran us and us-
ed our mistakes to score. It'll
be different, though, when we
go out there Saturday.”

The Wildcats play their first
home game Saturday against
Oglethorpe University at 2:30
on the local field.

The Oglethorpe game last
year was won by the ‘Cats
7-2. “Last year the Oglethorpe
game was very rough,"’ com-
mented soccer Coach Harry

Fogleman. “They use rough
tactics; they. try to butcher
you.”

Sophomore halfback George
Brown is optimistic. ‘‘This be-
ing our first home game, we
should have ‘a large crowd.
This ought to help us a lot.”
But he adds, “We won't be

right end for the sole score of
the game.

A deep drive into Sigma Nu
territory in the last minute of
play almost changed the course
of the game. But the one com-
pleted pass that would have
changed the score was caught
beyond the end zone. The Nus
took possession on their 9-yard
line and ran out the clock.

Pass interceptions proved to
be the crucial factor in one of
the more tense games of the

terized by lucky breaks and key
interceptions by both teams.

Despite the minor handicap
of only playing with six men
for the first few minutes the In
dependents took the lead with an
early TD and extra point to
make the score 7-0. Only toward
the end of the half were the
Chis able to connect a Ronny

the half time score at 74.
But the second half proved to

be a different story. A pass from
Basil Hicks to Rich Mildner
brought confidence back to the
Chis to make the score 13-7.

Later in the game, Bob Rhudy
broke loose on a long run which
tied up the game with only a
few minutes to go.

The last touchdown, a ‘‘freak"’
in the words of Ronny Ayers,
was made on a play from the
