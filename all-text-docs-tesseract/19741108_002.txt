borhood of $3,600 this year in
installation fees, while the
permanent installation of a
centrex system would only
have cost $4,000. Under the
resolution the college would
pay the initial cost of in-
stallation. :

Veazey added, “‘Another ad- ,
vantage would be the ease of
installing phone service each

from the hall.”

Veazey concluded by |
stating, ‘The only reason the
college doesn’t want centrex is
because they will lose the
system they now have in the
administration building,
which for them is cheaper. So
it comes down to whether the
school wants to do something
for the students.”
