Professorial Demands Cause
Acute Schizophrenia Blues

It has never feased to
amaze me that ‘every
professor at Davidson can
continue to believe year after
year that each of his students
has but one purpose in existen-
ce, that of devoting his time,
his energy and his mental
health to that one course of
study.

And as if I didn’t have
enough to do, what with each
of my professors subscribing
to this belief, the time has sud-
denly arrived for me to map
out my future as well. All of
the procrastination regarding
educational and vocational
decisions (i.e. “What are you
going to be when you graduate
‘young man?’’) must cease.
‘This month the Four. Hor-
semen of the academic
Apocalypse - law boards, med
school tests, graduate record

exams, and _ graduate
fellowship application
- appear to carry the

members of the senior class
away into their respective
futures.

Gregg Mian Breaks Image
In ‘Laid Back’ Rock-Blues Fusion

By LEE HUDSPETH
Staff Writer

Gregg Allman’s first solo
album, ‘Laid Back,” was
recorded in 1973 in Macon, Ga.
However, some of the other
artists involved in the album
are also members-past and
present--of The Aen
Brothers Band; mel

The music is a oe gh
many years of playing
Ceee experienced with his
brother Duane and eventually
The Allman Brothers Band it-
self; his style and approach to
music are deeply rooted in
Southern blues and _ its
development during the begin-
ning of his successful music
career.

The lyrics delve into ‘both

the good and bad in life; ‘‘All
My Friends” about concern
for friends, lovers, and
oneself; “Midnight Rider”
about escaping society; ‘‘Will
the Circle Be Unbroken’’
about death; ‘Multicolored
Lady”’ about a_ beautiful
woman and her emotions.

The music’s sound is a mix-
ture of smooth, soft acoustic
guitar mixed with some
keyboards, electric guitar,
saxophone, orchestration, and
easy drums;

“These Days” is the nant

and best song on Side Two and
its lyrics *speak of in-
trospection causing an inner
awareness of failure, yet how
such awareness can make for
a better future if we don’t
waste our days.

It is a very emotional. song
as Allman sings ‘‘these days I
seem to be afraid to live the

‘life I’ve made in song, but it’s

st that I have been losin’ so
ng.’’ ,

“Midnight Rider,” the first

song ‘on Side ‘One, . is an
earlier Allman Brothers
classic, but it has variations.

This arrangement is very
powerful, led by heavy chords
on an electric piano and elec-
tric and acoustic guitar leads.
Between verses there is a set
of quality instrumentation on
saxophones, other horns,

strings, and the electric piano.

The musical arrangement is
a simple one uniting a gentle
acoustic guitar rhythm as the
major component; a_ slide
guitar accentuating the lyrical
theme with a sad melody; and
electric piano, organ, and bass
all in the background.

This lends a mood of deter-
mination and passion to the
lyrics which tell a vague story
of a poor man’s struggle to
make ends meet in a society
‘out to get him. Such a
desperate feeling is difficult to
put into sound, but the band
does a superb job.

Although the music is of fine _

‘bre, the album taken as a
le begins to drag after
requent listenings. This is not
say that the individual
ngs lack vigor, just that the
ecord as a totality is
mewhat repetitive. This is
robably because‘ this is

} Ina country where jour-

jlong as it is non-libelous, to
deny a body of mature and in-

hypocritical.
Aside from the inherent
undesirability of censorship of
jany student publication, there
is cause for concern about the

While the Board of Trustees
never officially approved the
existing SCA. Constitution,
which states explicitly that no

‘student publication shall be
subject to censorship, stu-

dents and administrators
alike had adhered to them in
good faith until this year.

Of course it is arguable that
for some reason, the case in
question is so crucial as to
take precedence over even our
By-Laws. But ‘‘delegated’’
power which can be rescinded
with such facility is not really
delegated, but merely loaned.

presentation of nudity in Quips
and Cranks offensive, I would
request a closer examination -
of the dilemma. The prospect
of having our press activel:

To publish a ‘laundered

an insidious form of deceit.

arouse, but it can flourish at
Davidson only at great cost.
