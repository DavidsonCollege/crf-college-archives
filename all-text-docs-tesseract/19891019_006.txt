Men’s soccer stomps one, then ties one

By CARTER PAYNE
Davidson 7 - Canisius 0

The Wildcats started a bit slug-
gishly Saturday afternoon, but finished
witha flurry of second half goalsas they
went on to blow out the Canisius
Golden Griffins 7-0 in the First Charter
National Bank soccer invitational, held
at Davidson this past weekend.

In the first half neither team seemed
able to get any offense going as both
defenses played very aggressively. At
the 18:22 mark of the first half, sopho-
more forward Rob Ukrop stole a Cani-
sius pass at mid-ficld and hit junior
Peter Cobb as he sprinted toward the
goal. Cobb shook off a defender and
punched the ball past the diving goal
keeper for the score. The Wildcats had
other opportunities to score in the first
half, but could not capitalize. At the half
the score remained 1-0.

Then in the second half the Wild-
cats exploded. No more than five min-
utes into the period, Davidson
midfielder Tracy Hankins dribbled the
ball in tight and muscled it past both a
Canisius defender and the goal keeper

to make the score 2-0. After Hankins’s
goal the rout was on. Senior Rob Vest
scored next, followed by Ukrop and
sophomore Spider Wormuth. The lead
increased to 5-0.

The Davidson defenders, consist-
ing of seniors Ross Saldarini, Scott Pois-
son, sophomore Lance Long and goal
keeper Doug Long}did an excellent job.
They thwarted every Canisius attempt,
and kept the ball on the Canisius end of
the ficld the entire afternoon.

With about 22 minutes left in the
game, Ukrop moved the ball in close,
slashed left to right, and fired the ball
into the upper right corner for goal
number six. Four minutes later fresh-
man Glenn Smith got a piece of the
action as he blew, past the Canisius de-
fense to score the final goal.

Davidson 3 - Richmond 3

On Sunday the Wildcats faced per-
haps their toughest opponent of the
season in Richmond. The Wildcats
turned in a stellar performance for
almost the entire game. Sophomore Rob
Ukrop had another great day. He

scored two goals, one in the first half
and another in the second.

With five minutes left in the game
and the score 2-0 in Davidson’s favor, it
looked as though the Wildcats would
upset Richmond. However, with just
under two minutes remaining, the
Wildcat defense broke down com-
pletely and allowed two costly goals

which knotted the gameat 2-2 at theend
of regulation.

Senior Rob Vest put the wildcats on
the board first in overtime by heading
the ball past the Richmond goalkeeper.
A minute later Richmond scored the
final goal in what ended as an impres-
sive but disappointing stalemate for the
Wildcats.

Field hockey team won’t let youth block success

Russ and Cooke come through for the offense

By TRACEY LYNN PEREZ
The Lady Wildcats have
brought home victory after
victory since the start of the

season. The young team, led by.

Mary Russ, Monique Dockter
and Marjorie Havighurst
closed out Bridgewater and
soundly beat Pfeiffer in Sep-
tember.

The Pfeiffer game was exe-
cuted beautifully. After Pfeif-
fer scored early in the first half,
the Wildcats recovered and
turned the game into a goal-
fest. In the first half Gigi Cooke

and Russ made the score 2-1.

Then, in the second half Russ
scored again, then assisted
Cooke in knocking in the

fourth goal. Cooke scored
again with two minutes left in
the game. The Wildcats won 5-
1. :

Later in the month, the
Wildcats traveled to Winston-
Salem to face the Wake Forest
Demon Deacons. Davidson
lost 2-1. The only goal was
scored by Russ, assisted by
(guess who) Cooke.

The team didn’t play to its
full potential because it was
trying to adjust to the loss of
1988 Defensive MVP Francesca
Fierro. Fierro, who was also a
participant in the 1988 Nation-
alsin California, suffered a torn
ligament in her knee. It is likely
that she will be able to bring

back her dependable defense
next season.

After a series of rainouts,
Davidson pulled off a 1-0 over-
time win over Catawba. Hav-
ighurst assisted Cooke in scor-
ing the winning goal. Overall,
the game featured exciting
midfield play and few shotson
goal. The win was Davidson’s
first over Catawba in over six
years.

The Cats then travelled to
Eastern Mennonite College to
compete in the Shenandoah
Valley Classic. The teamloston
astroturf to Eastern Mennonite
3-0. As in the game against
Duke earlier in the season, the
Wildcats had trouble adjusting

to the faster playing surface.

In the next game against
Sweet Briar, Davidson was
considerably better adjusted
and whipped Sweet Briar 4-0.
Goals were scored by Cooke
(2), Dockter and Lauren Foll-
man.

At the end of the weekend
the Wildcats roadtripped to
Harrisonburg Va. and battled
Roanoke College to a 2-2 tie
after double overtime. After a
weekend on. astroturf, the
switch to a poor playing field
adversely affected the team’s
performance. Problems get-
ting the ball toroll freely left the
Cats down 0-1 in the first half;

but Cooke tied the game ona’

penalty stroke. Both teams
scored in the second half,
Davidson’sgoal came with five
minutes left. Coach Betsey
Pryor stated thatona smoother
field the game would have
been yet another victory forthe
Wildcats.

In their latest game’ the
Lady Wildcats faced powerful
Radford University in the
team’s toughest test since
Duke. Davidson played a su-
perb passing game, but fin-
ished on the tail end ofa close 2-
0 score.

The rain on Wednesday
postponed the Wildcats’ con-

‘frontation with Catawba until

today.
