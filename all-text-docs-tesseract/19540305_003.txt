Betas. Win Basketball Crown; Corky Clark Captains All Stars

The Betas came through this
week’s action against some of the
league’s toughest opposition to
cop the interfraternity basketball
race with a record of nine wins
and one defeat. Although the
champs were beaten by the ATOs
by 31-30 to spoil their chances for
an undefeated season they took a
‘close decision from the Pikas 33-30
to salvage their crown.

Besides the windup of the league
action for another year, the Inter-
fraternity All-Star teams were
chosen by the various teams dur-

dividual rankings went, came up

the ten-game stretch for a 47.1

will give a sneak preview of things to come as the much | #

talked about Red-White intra-squad game gets underway.
The encounter is sponsored by the “D” club with 25 cents
admission for students and 50 cents for adults. The day’s
activities will be capped off with a YMCA-Union dance in
the Union Ball room in the evening, beginning at 8 o'clock.

The gridders wound up their
practice activities for the spring
yesterday afternoon before the
game tomorrow with a lot of
hustle and spirit being shown.
From the pregame indications it
should be a hard fought battle be-
tween two evenly matched squads.
Tomorrow's game will wind up
the spring practice sessions.

row's tussle are as follows: for the
Whites—Jim Patterson (LE), Tom
Lee (LT), Lyle Liewelyn (LG), Tal

Don Campbell (LH), Ken Conger

Coach Dole has expressed on
several occasions during the course
of the practice sessions his satis-
faction with the results of this
training period. Things seem to
point to a much improved season
ahead for next fall.

Six men will miss tomorrow's
encounter because of injuries or
sickness. Bob Campbell is out with
a broken jaw, Ken Lawing has a
broken maxiliary in his face,
Randy Johnston is out with a
broken thumb, and Leroy Fargason

The first Southeastern Intercol-
legiate volleyball tournament
ended on February 26 with the
strong Florida State spikers in
first place, sporting a 20-0 record
in the two-day tornament. The

other team in the tournament and
also sweeping a four-game exhibi-
tion series with the nationally
ranking Kannapolis YMCA team.
North Carolina took the runner-
up position as they lost only to
Florida State and came out with
a 14-8 score.

South Carolina and Davidson
were in a tight race for third
place honors with South Carolina
nosing out the Wildcats by win-
ning ten of twenty games while
Davidson took eight. The two
teams met in each round and split
each time with identical 2-2 records
against each other. Following in
fifth and sixth place were Ap-
palachian and Alabama State
Teachers College.

Davidson's Wildcats took games
from Appalachian, South Carolina,
and Alabama in the course of play,
starting out strong by winning
three of their first four contests.
Leading the team were Lee Scott,
Vince Gould, Linnie Baker, Tom
Lambe, John McLaughlin, and

Davidson’s Wildcats bowed out of the Southern Conference Tournament last night

when they dropped their opening round of the tourney to Furman. The Cats matched the

a first period spurt that Furman was able to move out in front. After taking an eleven

Swimmers Miss 2nd.
By Only Two Points

Last weekend Davidson's tank-
men finished fourth in the South-
ern Conference swimming meet
held at VPI. The Cats were barely
nosed out for second place. VPI
finished with 28 points, The Cita-
del had 27 and the Cats tallied
26. VMI won the mect easily in
taking every first place for a 143

Bud Montgomery placed fifth in

As usual, it was Frank Selvy who

The Corbin flash scored 36 points,

11 in the first quarter, to pace the | @
scoring for both teams. Hobby | #
Cobb, Graeme Keith, and George | &

Melton all hit in the double figures
for Davidson, with Cobb leading
the way with 16.

The tournament loss marked the
second time within a week that
the Paladins have proven too much
for the Cats. Last Friday night

the Davidson club dropped a 105-,

93 decision to Furman, as Frank
Selvy, the captain of this year's
All-American squad, scored 50
points.

It was by far the best game of
the year for the Cats. Greenville
sports writers had predicted that
Selvy would outscore the entire
Davidson team. Instead, Coach
Lyles Alley was forced to use his
regulars all the way in order to
beat the scrapping Cats. Davidson
pulled to within eight points of
the lead midway in the fourth
quarter, but a final push by the
Hurricane gave them the winning
margin. .

Graeme Keith, Ish Bennett, and
Hobby Cobb all broke the twenty
mark in the contest. Keith poured
in 27 points to lead the Davidson
scoring, while Bennett and Cobb
both racked up 24 points. Darrel
Floyd scored 20 points for Furman.

Davidson finished the season
with a record of 7 wins and 15
losses, with a disastrous pre-Christ-
mas stint proving fatal to the sea-
son’s mark. Prior to the holidays,
the Cats lost six of seven contests
before Coach Danny Miller finally

found the right combination. Then

point lead in the initial quarter, Furman we nt on to win the game by 84-68.

GEORGE MELTON

“Tall Timber” maede his
fast appearance at the South-
ern Conference tourney this
weekend.

the Wildcats won four of five con-
tests in a late January-early Feb-
ruary streak to boost the mark
considerably. Hobby Cobb’s much
improved play was the most
pleasant surprise of the campaign.
Only a sophomore, Cobb led the
team in scoring this year and be-
came a fine rebounder as well.

The Davidson freshman team
ended its season last Tuesday
against the North Carolina frosh.
The Kittens lost a close, 53-44, de-
cision to the heavily-favored Tar
Babies in a contest in Charlotte.
The frosh ended a very successful
season with a record of ten wins
and four losses.
