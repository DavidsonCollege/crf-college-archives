Saves Energy by Not
Doing Shit for Christ-
mas Decorations

Patterson Court--The _ broth-
ers of Sigma Chi Theta fraternity
have set an example for the entire
Davidson Community. By choos-
ing not to decorate their house for
Christmas, the house saved 18,000
Joules, an estimated $260, and a
shit load of their time.

“By not decorating,
the house saved 18,000
Joules, an estimated

$260, and a shit load of
their time.”

“As an environmentally aware
house, we would rather wait until
alternative fuel sources have been
consolidated before we spurn valu-
able energy on something so trivial
as our own
enjoyment of
Chistmas,”
said _Presi-
, dent Amold
'Newsome

brothers sec-
——_—__—_—_————— onded__ these
words, but added that they also
don’t give a rat’s ass how this shit-
hole looks because they don’t be-
lieve in Christmas or in improving
the community.

“It’s the girt that keeps on giv-
ing,” said one drunk brother.

A house that cares.

Mythbusters Disprove
The Existence of God

God turned out to be one big hoax.

Hollywood, Calif.—God is
dead. In the latest installment of
their popular Discovery Channel
series, renowned “Mythbusters”
Adam Savage and Jamie Hyeman
put to rest once and for all the ru-
mored existence of “God,” a mys-
terious character alluded to in such
films as The Ten Commandments
and The Passion of the Christ.

Also known as “Jehovah” and
“Yaweh,” He is referred to in nu-
merous gospels, scriptures, psalms,
tracts and theological dissertations,
although no one has yet confirmed
his existence.

“The original idea for the epi-
sode was to see if sticking a pole in
the spokes of a motor cycle could
cause a head-over-heals flip,” said

Adam, “but my motorcycle is still
in the shop. We had other ideas—
beer goggles, cabin fever, whether
Oddjob’s hat could really decapitate
a statue. But these were too com-
plex. We needed something quick
and to the point. That’s where this
God character came in.”

“Using a Bic lighter,
three cups of baking
soda and a flywheel,
Adam and Jamie set
the record straight.”

Using a Bic Lighter, three cups
of baking soda and a flywheel,
Adam and Jamie whipped up an
experiment that would finally set
the record straight. “We said, ‘Hey,
God, if you’re real, turn this into a
cool episode. Make some shit blow
up. Turn the baking soda to wine.
Soak the moon in blood. Show thy-
self.” We waited for hours. Noth-
ing. Not a thing. This whole God
question was an elaborate hoax,”
said Adam.

In their next episode, Jamie and
Adam test whether or not it was
physically possible for the Anaheim
Angels to win the 1994 American
League pennant, as propounded by
the movie Angels in the Outfield.
“Ever since we disproved the ex-
istence of God, I’ve really doubted
whether that was possible,” said
Adam.

Can We Put a Black
Field Goal Kicker in
the NFL? Yes We Can

In the past half-century, we have
made incredible strides against rac-
ism. We have put a man of mixed
race in the white house. We have
had a woman of mixed race serve
as Secretary of State. We have seen
all races admitted to the most pres-
tigious universities, law firms and
medical practices. But only when
a black man, for no good reason,
whimsically drop-kicks a field goal
in the dying minutes of a meaning-
less NFL game, only then will ra-
cial equality be achieved.

“Only when a black
man drop-kicks a field
goal in the dying min-
utes of an NFL game,

only then will racial
equality be achieved.”

Place kicking, like dentistry
and accounting, has always been
a uniquely white province. Kick-
ing is the true bastion of whiteness.
Blacks have come to dominate
sports demanding speed, agility,
and power, but they have yet to
infiltrate that singular position of
sickly whiners and rejected soccer
players, the position that let Mor-
tin Anderson kick until he went on
Social Security, that let Janikowski
into this country. It’s a long attempt
for America. Can we make it?

Yes. Yes we can.

Impurities Found in Elon’s Bottled Water

Washington, D.C.—A_ recent
statement by the FDA warned that
impurities had been found in the
bottled water of Elon University.

oo

a

The water bottling plant known
as Elon University has let down.
its filters and admitted impurities.

FDA Commissioner Mark
Montgomery declared, “This
proves that Elon does not have
sufficient filters in place. They’ve
admitted impurities into their water
that a better bottler, such as David-
son, never would have let in.

“However, this is not to say that
Elon bottled water is as impure as,
say, Mars Hill or UNC Asheville

bottled water, in which we have
found potentially fatal traces of
lead.”

“Elon admitted some
impurities that a
better bottler such
as Davidson never
would have let in.”

For some, the cheaper price
tag of Elon bottled water justified
its impurities. Charlotte father of
three Gary Clarke commented,
“Unless someone buys four years
of Davidson bottled water for my
family, I’ll probably just give my
kids Elon bottled water. It may not
taste good, but it won’t kill them.”

Davidson bottled water is an
elite southern liberal arts brand
drank by several national. caliber
basketball players, 1690 nerds and
twenty-three Rhodes Scholars. It
has no known impurities.
