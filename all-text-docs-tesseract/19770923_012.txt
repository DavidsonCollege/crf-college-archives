Late night disc jockey likes

By ESTHER BRUCE
Staff Writer

Deep in the bowels of the Union late
in the night, Sophomore Sid Kilgore
bends over the rust-brown WDAV
turntable. He puts on a record and
leans back. ;

Sid likes the idea of spending his
Friday nights acting as a disc jockey
for the student radio when everyone
else is partying or in bed. Although he

is physically alone, he is constantly
talking to, and often listening to, the
other late night people who make up
his listening audience.

While to some this particular time
spot, from 11 until 2, would seem to
be the least desirable one, Sid does
not feel that way. In fact, he says, ‘‘I
chose it.”’

He chose it because, ‘‘(a) it doesn’t
really interfere with any other activi-

O’Connor also stressed that due to
a lack of education many old people
need help in unraveling the bureau-
cratic complexities of the programs
available to them. Because many
senior citizens were born at the turn of
the century when education wasn’t
stressed, they often have little more
than a grammar school education.

The agency plans to meet all these
needs except group meetings and
visitations, which are already taken

don’t mind holding hands, not in the
least, but we really do it because Mrs.
Goudy has trouble walking without
something to steady her,’’ he ex-
plained.

‘It’s not all romance,’’ revealed
Mrs. Goudy.

Citizens Club, which, although not
affiliated with the agency, will use the
Depot for meetings. These meetings
will be both educational and recrea-
tional, according to O’Connor.

She is opening a drop-in center for
both the elderly and others who wish
to spend some of their time with the
aged.

The Coopeative Services isin need
of volunteers to furnish transporta-
tion both around town and to Char-
lotte, and possibly to do chores like
cleaning gutters or mowing lawns.
O’Connor also hopes to be able to act
as a broker to ‘‘match up people who

can pay for services with people who .

want to work—older or younger.”
Students can be especially useful
by informing people of the services.
She also wants to enlist as much
volunteer support as possible, both to
help with services and to visit the
center to spend time with the older
people.
“‘Interning at the agency is a
possibility that some Davidson stu-

dents may explore in the future,’’ said

O'Connor. ae

weekdays.

Trap draws bugs

By BILL PEEPLES
Staff Writer

Is Davidson College the scene of an
Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller?
And is Tom Daggy a mad scientist
seeking to destroy the community by
attracting hoards of swarming in-
sects?

Why such madness, gathering-up
to five thousand moths, beetles, flies,
and other assorted flying creatures
each ni Surely the Dana Science
Building has not become a testing
ground for ‘‘Rid-A-Bug’”’ or ‘‘Deep
Woods Off!’’

For two weeks now, students
walking in the vicinity of the Union at
night have been noticing a strange,
circular light reminiscent of a Miller
Highlife sign hanging from a tree in
front of Dana. To the ignorant, it is
an odyssey; to Dr. Daggy, it is the
gizmo that gobbles up the bugs, like a
football player eating at Slater during
pre-school camp.

Daggy explained, ‘“‘These insects,
the ones that are positively phototro-
pic, are attracted by ultra-violet more
than any other light wavelength.”’
This simple device not only attracts
bugs, but pulls them into a lethal jar
of alcohol by a vacuum fan, located
directly behind the light source.

The purpose of the trap, Daggy
reported, is to collect thousands of
insects to be used in compiling long

ties I have; (b) it’s something fun to
do; and (c) I like to be up at that hour
and talk to other people who are up at
that hour.’’

In the small, stuffy broadcasting
room Sid’s wide-awake eyes glance
about. His shaggy blond mane is held
in place only by the headphones which
characterize all the members of his
trade. The top four buttons of his
shirt are unbuttoned because of the
heat.

Hastily taking a sip of his Coke, he
gets out of his swivel chair to peruse
the stacks of albums. Not finding
anything he wants on the top shelf, he
squats down to file through a bottom
one.

His finger rests on some obscure
recording, a look of satisfaction
spreads across his face; he pulls the
treasure out of its hiding place and
returns to his seat just in time to put
it on the turntable before he must
return to the air himself.

lists of data. They are sorted,
counted, recorded, and sometimes
mounted. So far, Davidson’s resident
entomology expert has collected in-
sects each night, all night, for two
summers.

From this data, he hopes to
discover the effects of seasonal chan-
ges, rainfall, temperature, relative
humidity, and other factors on insect
succession in and around Davidson.

When asked what varieties he
usually catches, Daggy cautioned
against generalizations. A pattern he
explained is that the insects most
commonly found in the trap each
morning are those which appear in
small numbers.

Whereas several thousand flies may
be caught one night,’ relatively few
will be around to meet this gruesome
fate three weeks later. The same holds
true for various moths and beetles;
those appearing in large numbers are
not trapped with any level of consis-
tency.

What becomes of these thousands
of specimens, and-what effect do their
premature deaths have upon the local
ecosystem? Daggy tries to mount all
those he has time for, especially the
unusual ones, and the rest are left to
clutter his research lab.

He argued that he catches only the
surplus for his research, having no
negative effect on the local popula-
tion.

AM job

Sid, from Clearwater, Florida, is
used to all-night establishments of
many sorts, and he finds this area
lacking in that respect. His radio
show is the substitute to which he
resorts.

The music he plays varies widely,
greatly depending upon his own
personal fancies. Sid usually plays
progressive rock, which he describes
as, ‘“‘something we have in the
civilized parts of the country.”

He often plays things other than
music though, such as comedians and
Monty Python. On occasion, he says,
“T get these...interesting moods and I
start playing test records.’’ Once he
played “forty-eight minutes worth of
turkey gobbles.”

On the whole the music he plays
during the small hours of the morning
are not “‘top-forty” songs. He plays
the songs which are on albums with
well-known songs, but which are
rarely heard themselves. He uses
“groups nobody’s ever heard of,”’ who
have ‘‘really good music.”’

But, he says, ‘‘there are certain
regulations.’’ Some words which are
widely deemed socially unacceptable
may slip in from time to time, but a
song which has a definite theme of
‘‘grossness’’ may not be aired.

Call-ins? Yes, he gets them. ‘‘A lot
of people call in just sitting around
their rooms. They call to tell me they
like my music, or,” he volunteered,
“to tell me they don’t like my music.”
He gets occasional harrassment from
his friends and roommate, but it is all
in fun.

Sid signs off at 2 am because the

amanagement locks the Union doors

then. He is nupiig towet a key so that
he can perhaps broadcast longer, but
he is doubtful if he will succeed.
