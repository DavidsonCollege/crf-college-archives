Up All Night

First Night Down jumpstarts the Court’s night life

First Night Down — the first
night for freshmen to leave behind
the hall parties and dance into the
real college life of fraternities and
upperclassmen.

The evening began with the
traditional hall dinner at Prime to
prevent drinking on an empty stom-
ach. Following that, many fresh-
men acquired a buzz before head-
ing down to the court while the
fraternities were busy setting up
the bands, buying beer, and clean-
ing their houses.

At ten o’clock, the music
Started and freshmen littered the
Court. Because of the built up
anticipation, certain expectations
were imagined in the minds of
freshmen. One freshman visual-
ized First Night Down consisting
of a large campus wide party but
instead found multiple gatherings.

Nevertheless, First Night
Down is an opportunity for the
houses to express their different
personalities and appeal to fresh-

men who share those similarities.
A major component to an appeal-
ing party is music, and where there
is great dance music there is a
crowd. The court hosted a variety
of bands ranging from rock to blue
grass and hip-hop.

And, yes, alcohol is another
appealing factor in a party. Even
with the new alcohol policy there
was no shortage of beer for the
freshmen — just longer lines at the
top of the stairs. A couple of houses
did run out of beer around 1 a.m.,
but most freshmen had consumed
their limit and were content.

Many concerns were voiced,
as always, about the judgment of

freshmen while drinking. There’

were no major problems reported
with First Night Down. The lack
of incidents is hopefully a result of
the preparation that goes into edu-
cating the freshmen. P.E. 101 takes
precaution to reinforce that such
events as sexual harassment and
Tape can occur on campus. Hall
counselors reminded the freshmen
of the dangers and encouraged them
to look out for each other. ~

Even if a student were not into
the drinking scene, he or she had at
least one beer spilled on them. In
the packed houses, where dancing
was swaying among numerous
bodies, accidents did occur. Inthat
environment, people shoved you
and realized it and apologized, or
they were to drunk to notice.

In this type of environment
not everyone feels comfortable;

those freshmen who avoided the
court still had a great time in the
senior apartments mingling with
upperclassmen or just enjoying the
company. of their fellow class-
mates.

And First Night Downis never
complete without going to the
Outpost for a bite to eat. During
the early morning hours, it was
crowded with students ready to
grabasnack beforecrashing. Many
freshmen the next day agreed they
hada great time; however, they felt
First Night Down was overrated.

Inany event, the Class of 2000
saw their initiation into the Court
as a positive scene filled with great
music and intense dancing.
