College Magazine To
Have New Features

Editor Fugate Completes Job

With This Edition

Wilber L. Fugate, editor of “The
Yowl,” announced today that the last
edition of this student publication will

appear the latter part of this week.

’ Many new features have been added
and the magazine enlarged to such an
extent that it is thought to be the
biggest “Yowl” ever published at Da-
vidson. The editors have worked night
and day in an effort to fill its forty-
four pages with the best material ob-
tainable.

Outstanding additions to the maga-
zine include: a number of caricatures
and writings dealing principally with
prominent campus figures, a poll or
questionnaire of the Senior class in
which the seniors use their privileges,
and a section devoted to interviews
with the captains of this year’s va-
rious athletic teams. The next issue
will be the third and last issue of the
year.

Two short stories by Gordon Wood
and Stuart Henry are also new fea-
tures in the coming edition. Henry’s
story is something new hereabouts in
that it follows the James Joyce pat-
tern and is entirely devoid of punc-
tuation. Wood’s story is a psycholog-
ical study of a man with a very pe-
culiar mania—in fact, somewhere or
other he has accidentally misplaced his
face.

The cover is a satirical drawing ar-
ranged in the true “Skip” Brown fash-
ion with its .fading colors revealing
an amusing glimpse of Hitlerite Ger-
many.

Furman President
Makes Chief Talk
For Founders Day

Dr. Geer Warns Against Over-
Secularization of Church
Schools
BAND GIVES CONCERT

All Departments of School Aid in

Celebration
Davidson College, 97 years ago a
school of four small buildings, ele-

mentary courses and kerosene lights,
paused on Founders’ Day, April 12, to
pay tribute to its past and consider
the future of the institution.

In a day which saw the Wildcat nine
defeat the vaunted Duke ball club, all
departments of the college united in
the celebration of the occasion. The
music department, band and glee club
occupied prominent positions on the
program and a half-holiday from study
was declared by the faculty,

Dr. Ben E. Geer, president of Fur-
man University, was the principal
speaker of the occasion. Speaking at
chapel, he analyzed the future of the
church school and warned of the dan-
ger of “a Founders’ Day where there
has been a wide departure from the
ideals of the founders.”

“In the early days of Davidson and

Furman, both church schools, their
leading teachers were those with
avowed faith in Christian teachings.

If we are to maintain Christian char-
acter as church schools,” stated Dr.
Geer, “we dare not depart from’ the
simplicity and conviction of those who
founded.”

Speaking of the financial character
of church schools, Geer warned against
over-secularization and stated, “When
and if Davidson College should be-
come financially independent of its
supporting Presbytery, so that it does

rifice of its people, then Davidson Col-
lege will face a decline to seculariza-
tion. It thus loses the power to serve
the church in the finest way.

“A warm religious life is not in-
consistent with academic honesty, with
untiring research in any field, .,.., I
firmly believe in the church school for
I firmly believe in the church.” That
was his declaration of belief in the
future of church schools.

Quoting Matthew Arnold, he ex-
pressed the present national crisis as
a nation “wandering between two
worlds, one dead, the other powerless
to be reborn.” In Washington there
has been confusion, grasping and
doubt; in the nation there has been
a general laxity and decadence in na-

D. C. Debaters Lose
Twice In Past Week

University of Florida and Wake
Forest Debate Here

a.

Va,

were defeated
twice this past week when they met
the University of Florida here Tues-
day, April 11, and again on Saturday,
April 14, when they went down before
a strong Wake Forest team.

On both occasions the Davidson
teams supported the affirmative side
of the question: “Resolved, that the
powers of the President should be sub-
stantially increased as a settled policy.”

The master of ceremonies or presid-
ing officer for both events was Gordon
H. Brown, another Davidson™stidént
debater.

In a losing battle of words Tuesday
evening, A, C. Stutts and R..H. Smith,
speaking for Davidson, defined the is-
sue clearly and then proceeded to show
that a progressing nation has need of
an expanding and pliable constitution.
The changes that they jointly argued,
they assured us, could be best brought
about by the constructive system which
they advocated.

In their turn, W. Re Terry and Lon-
nie Wurm, representing the University
of Florida, sought to prove to a small
but appreciative audience that the
powers of the Presidént of these
United States were already sufficient
to meet the demands of any govern-
ment and, furthermore, that the Presi-
dent of the United States did not use
all the power that was vested in him
anyway. Wurm went further in re-
viewing the past Presidents and their
administrations in order to prove that
we could hot expect to have a man as
