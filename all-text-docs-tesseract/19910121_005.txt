By now, the poster feud has become trite, and some things
need to be made clear. It seems that the issue has divided itself
into two sides: those who believe “PEACE DEMONSTRA-
TIONS AGAINST THE MIDDLE EAST INVOLVEMENT
HURT TROOP MORALE. IF OUR TROOPS LACK CONFI-
DENCE, MORE OF THEM WILL DIE!” and those who
believe the opposite--that the demonstrations are not meant to
shatter morale, just to end the war. It seems that the issue,
then, becomes one of perception, that is, how one side per-
ceives the other. From reading the anti-peace-demonstration
posters, one can learn: “This is not Viet Nam. Woodstock was
21 years ago! That era is gone, so grow up.”

It is, therefore, obvious that the anonymous scribbler of the
poster seems to associate peace demonstrations with the likes
of Woodstock, which is the freedom of every anonymous
scribbler--to perceive and utter such associations. After all,
many styles of clothes of the 1960’s have become fads in the
1980’s, such as tie-dyes and sandals, giving every reason for
every anonymous scribbler everywhere to make the associa-
tion that just because certain persons wear the clothes of a fad,
they are, by definition, faddish. So granted.

Perhaps the power of the peace march died at the point
when an era, the 60’s, manifested itself into trend, as we are
led to believe through another anonymous scribbler who has
written, “Sandals were made for the sand.”

But though Woodstockian hippie clothe bearers will never
not carry the label of their era, does ii mean that any such
present bearers--marching for peace--will have themselves and
their goals nullified, simply because of what might be an’
historical clothing association on the part of a scribbler?

Suggestion for demonstrators: why not have a demonstra-
tion in which letters are written to our soldiers abroad? Not a
letter writing. A rally..Why not have a peace rally at which
every person wrote a letter to soldier? Wave the flag, wear the
clothes, write a letter. That way, maybe perceptions might
change, and anonymous scribblers would stop and scratch
their heads at what.to do before they scribbled. Maybe they
could seeto _. broaden their passions for troop support to
include an equal fervor for war’s end. :

However, since perceptions will not change, we have time
to think of the analogy of a mother and father screaming at
each other while in between them is the kid too scared to cry.
The anonymous scribbler says, “DON’T MAKE IT AN-

OTHER VIET NAM. SUPPORT OUR TROOPS.” A peace

Letters

Peace Posters Spur Debate

To the Editors:

Like the poster version,
this letter is not intended to
stir up debate. I simply want

to clear up amisunderstand-
ing before it gets outof hand.
I speak with confidence for
those involved with peace
efforts on campus because
this isan issue we have often
discussed.

We gather and work for
peace with the troops in
mind, not out of antagonism
for them. We understand that
the men and women serving
in the Gulf are doing a job.
Our frustration is not with
them, but with their boss.

To support an individ-
ual does not mean one can-
not disagree with those who
control his or her life. We
support the troops as indi-
viduals in an unimaginable
circumstance and we dis-
agree with the administra-

$3000.00

tion which has put them
there.

We find ourselves faced
with adifficult decision now.
How do we work for peace
in the midst of this war?

The main alternative to
war which we clung to,
namely economic sanctions,
has been taken away. Now
that it has begun, we can
only hope that it ends
quickly. But to support this
action presupposes that one
believes that it is a worthy
alternative.

Tosupport this wareven
now is to support war as a
means of conflict resolution.

The alternative we
choose is to gather for peace.
We gather because we be-
lieve that war cannot and
must not be set as the prece-
dent for conflict resolution.

We gather because we ~

too havea vision for the “new
world order” -- a world in

on T.V.

DON'TDELAY.

which open dialogue re-
places threat and in which
diplomacy, paticnce and
compassion are noble attrib-
utes of a nation’s leader.

We gather because we
want the men and women to
come home safely.

Thisisnot Vietnam. This
is not a 60’s and 70’s peace
movement carry-over.

Wehaveanew message:
one of peace for and solidar-
ity with those whose lives
are most seriously threatened
now.

Weare very sensitive to
the condition of our troops
in the Gulf, and we do not
mean to turn our backs on
them in any way. In Wash-
ington, we will carry two
banners that read, “Peace.
We Support Our Troops
Alive. Bring Them Home.”
