“For your own sakes don't take the
short cut to medicine if you can possibly
manage to finance your training over a
longer period,” was the advice of Dr, Ad-
dison Brenizer, prominent Charlotte phy-
sician to prospective medical students in
Shearer Hall, last Thursday night. Unless
pressed hy financial difficulties he advised
not to hurry through the preparation for
the medical profession, especially not to
try to cut out any college training.

Dr. Brenizer painted a clear picture
of the difficulties of the study of medi-
cine, not only in the rigid training in med-
ical school and as an enterne but in start-
ing a practice.

Dr. Brenizer made many practical sug-
gestions in regard to study, starting out
in practice, specialization, and individual
work or partnership. After the address
a number stayed to discuss with him. par-
ticular problems. Friday morning, also,
he held interviews in the form of dis-
cussion groups. Dr. McConnell an-
nounced that he could give any desired
information concerning medical colleges
in the United States and would be glad
to advise with any students about the
best school for them to attend.

The Lord’s Prayer is a poem both
form and in content, but it differs
somewhat from our present standards
of poetry. It was composed by Christ
in the form of poetry which was based
two elements:

on rhythmic or pendu-
lum-like swing, and repitan or use of
one phrase in several connections in
the same Rythm is shown
throughout the prayer; for example,
“forgive us our debts—as we forgive
our debtors.” Repitan illustrated
by the use of “on earth as it in
Heaven” in the following: “Thy king-
dom come, Thy will be done on earth
it in Heaven.” The prayer is
divided into three parts: the introduc-
tion, the body, and the doxology. It
was given by Christ to unlettered men
who could easily remember rhythm,
and it was probably given by him aft-
er he had used it several times. The
