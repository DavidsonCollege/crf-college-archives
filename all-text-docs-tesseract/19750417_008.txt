came close to several others in
meets held here this past week.
The Wildcats finished fifth in a
17-team field Saturday’ in the
16th Annual Davidson Relays.

Western Carolina won three
relays in scoring 89 points to
edge defending champion West
Georgia’s 84 total. Following
them were Berry with 74, Ap-
palachian with 73, and David-
_ son with 66.
~ Among other teams _par-
ticipating were High Point,

discus, javelin, triple jump, six
mile, and high hurdles. Two
records were set in new events,
the steeplechase and hammer.

Davidson scored 50 of its
points in six of the 12 individual
events. They added 16 points by
placing in 3 of the seven relays.

Greg Love tied the school
record in the 120-yard high hur-
dles, running a 14.2 in the finals
to. take second place. He also
anchored the 480-yard shuttle
hurdle relay to a second place
finish.

Trumbo and freshmen Gary
Danciger and Dick Boehner.

Boehner also ran on the mile
and two-mile relay teams, both
of which won their heat and
placed fourth overall.

3:22.6 to tie the school record
set in 1969. Senior captain Mark
Connors ran a 48.5 anchor,

Honors work at the depart-
mental level was established
at Davidson in 1927 to
“stimulate the exceptional
student to stretch himself to
his capacity and to allow him
to put his work on a semi-
independent basis outside of
the classroom.”’

Only 6 miles north

held last Saturday. The team: had an excellent day in several events and

Van Meter made his annual
appearance in the 880 relay, in

which his past performances
have led others to ask: ‘Does
that guy really run track?”

' The Keydets of VMI invaded
Richardson Field Monday af-
ternoon, using strategically
placed elbows to fight their
way to a 98-65 triumph.

VMI swept the intermediate
hurdles and long and triple
jumps to build a 36-0 advantage
which the Cats could not over-

come.

Connors once again had an
exceptional day, winning the
100 and 220 and running a per-
sonal best 48.4 anchor split in
the mile relay for a come-from-
behind victory there.

His 22.1 in the 220 is nearing
the school record of 21.3. set
seven years ago, and he should
challenge the open 440 record
of 48.7 set in 1962.

Pinckney ran a 15:09.5 to
take second place in the three-
mile, and: his time is within
three seconds of Coach Sterling
Martin’s record.

Van Meter cleared 14’ in the
pole vault, .while Allen
Schaberg won the discus for the
fourth time this year with a
heave of 133710’’.

Freshmen Justus and
Boehner ran their best times of
the year, with Justus winning
the 440 in 51.6 and Boehner run-

ning a gutty 1:57.8 to take
second in the 880.

Diller grabbed second in both
the shot and hammer, while
Love won the highs in 14.6

Davidson swept the high
jump, with Stanfield and
Trusgnich again clearing 6’4”
to tie for first. Stanfield cleared
6’6” after the competition was
over, which is higher than the -
6’5%4”’ jump record by Rixey
who finished third.

The track team’ travels to
The Citadel for a meet Satur-
day to close out the regular

‘season. A win there would

leave them 4-4 for the year.
