The work of the camp has gained
‘national recégnition in the two years
it has been located in the mountains
of western North Caralina. The
Washington papers called it the
“Interlocken of the South”.

The purpose of the camp is to
train the youth of the South in ap-
preciation and proficiency in music.
Courses {for high school credit are

taught in music theory and apprecia-
tion. Band, orchestra, chorus, and
ensemble make up the varied organi-
zations at the. camp.

Music, however, does not con-
stitute the entire camp life. Under
the able supervision of Coach Nor-
man Shepard, also of Davidson Col-
Tege, a well ‘rounded recreational

program was planned. Softball, ten-.

nis, volley ball, badminton, boating,
archery, riding, swimming, and:hik-
ing were available to thc students,
both boys and girls.

Davidson College was well re-
presented in the administrative end
of the camp. Besides Mr. Pfohl and
Coach Shepard were Mr. and Mrs,
Earl Berg of Davidson. Mr. Berg
is a member of the faculty and had
charge of the vocal department of
the camp. In, addition to the fine
chorus headed by Mr. Berg, an ex-
cellent performance of “H.M.S.
Pinafore” of Gilbert and Sullivan
was presented. Others on the fac-
ulty were Mrs. Pfohl, who taught
piano and Clara Smith, who was
the art instructor. Councilors from
Davidson were Frank Barr, Byran
Blackwell, Sam Linberger, Spencer
Murray, and Frank West.

“Students were well blessed with
guest artists this summer, as Edwin
Gershifski, pianist; Mark Woller,
violinist; Tom Pyle, baritone; and
Henry Fillmore. Fillmore, president
of the American Bandmasters Asso-
cation, was very popular with stu-
dents in the camp. He has written
many fine marches and specializes
in lighter band music. Because of
Devidson’s representation at the
camp, we would like to congratulate
Mr. Pfohl and his fine record and
work with the youth of the south in
music.

Prospects for a fine Artist Series
next year are very good, The plan-
ning of the series has just begun
and some announcement will be
made: soon. Considering the war
and small student body, Davidson
College has been able to have a good
series. We hope that next year
the student body will see fit to sup-
port such a group of programs as
is being planned now.

Osborne To Go
To Univ. of Ark.

Will Be Head Of ‘Fine Arts
Department

Kenneth Osborne of the music
department has, announced that he
has accepted ‘a new position at the
University of Arkansas. —

Mr. Osborne, who was an assis-
tant professor, will go to the Uni-
versity as dean of the fine arts de-
partment. This is an adininistrative
post for Mr. Osborne, having music
and art under his supervision. .

The University of Arkansas is
located at Fayetteville, having a
population of 8,000. One of the main
projects of next year for its Fine
Arts department is the building of a
half million dollar building in which
it is to be housed.

This is a wonderful promotion for
Mr. Osborne, and we feel sure he
can do much to promote the purpose
of music in his new position.

Here at Davidson Mr. Osborne has
been a popular member of the David-
son faculty. He has been instructor of
theory and piano as well as being
ithe college organist. In addition
fo this he has been the Y.M.C.A.
secretary for the past two summers.
Mr. Osborne is a member of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon social frater-
nity and of Phi Mu Alpha, music
fraternity. He is 2 member of the
American Guild of ba cate and is
a Mason.

In his new netlion Mr. Osborne
will probably teach advanced courses
in music theory and history, He
will also instruct organ. We will
miss Mr. Osborne very much next
year, but we are glad to see him
advance in his field. He, along with
Mrs. Osborne and their two child-
ren will leave Davidson at the end
of the summer.

'l experienced again. It is a pity that

we have to derart, never to see
each other again probably. ‘Some
will be going into the service, others

to seminary, and still others to

medical school. Wherever our var-
ious paths may lead, let ‘us never
forget the things that Davidson
has -tried to impress upon us. The,
high standards that one tries to at-
tain here should always be honored
by the example we set.

To those of us who return we
have a greater responsibility, both
freshmen and upperclass men. The
coming year will depend a lot on
you, whether or not Davidson con-
tinues to train its students in the

traditions and customs that it has
adhered to so long. Many new men
will appear on the campus in Sep-
tember who are not familiar with
those traditions, and it is our duty
and privilege to set an example
worthy of the men who have done
so well in the past. Those new men
will be extremely alert to every-
thing you say and do. Be careful
what you say and be of service to
them. They will be indebted to you
for whatever service you can render,
and there is much that can be done
in the first week or so at college
Davidson has always tried to bring
out the best in men, and from lack
of upperclassmen, the responsibility
will lay heavily upon freshmen, who
are wise and discreet. So think upon
these things!

The Y.M.C.A. cabinet has initiated
itwo very important things toward
the spiritual development ‘of our
students. The first was the begin-
ning of morning devotionals which
are held each Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday mornings at 7:45. Thus
far the devotonals have been well
‘attended.

The second was the distributing
of daily devotionals to all students
in the dormitories. It is the prayer
of this column that each Student will
try to use the devotionals..each day.
The cabinet has seriously thought
of the spiritual development of the
students, and has initiatéd these for
the students, and it is their earnest
take
advantage of them.

Think on these things!
