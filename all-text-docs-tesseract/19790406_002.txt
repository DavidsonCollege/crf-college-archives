is natural and to be expected. <pte .
Yet it is important fora Southern college not to forget
the problems of South Africa, however more immediate
and alarming the nuclear issue, because those problems
are a grimy mirror held up to our own regional past. To
ignore Soweto is to forget Birmingham.

Davidson is not doing what it should be doing,
certainly not what it could be doing, on the South African
investment issue. When: Davidson’s Trustees recently
paren an investment policy the college got a lot of good
publicity it did not deserve. Wire stories issued at the
time made it sound as if Davidson had made the difficult
moral decision not to invest in South African corpora-
tions, when the college never had any such investments
to begin with and there is no evidence it ever intended to
obtain them. |

_ Actually the Trustees’ investment policy is meaning-
less, and if it does a single thing, it merely camouflages.
the fact that Davidson is not actively going to do anything
about social injustice in South Africa. The policy
statement, in part, reads, “American corporations wit
South African operations should work to ameliorate the

ces of apartheid.” This is certainly a very nice
Statement, but what does it mean?

Nothing.

‘ Board Chairman Warner Halli freely admitted on the day
the investment policy statement was issued that the
college isn’t going to send letters to the South-African-
related tions in which we own stock, telling them
to start ameliorating consequences. Only if the corpora-
tion itself sends Davidson a referendum ballot on an issue
directly pencerwnd South Africa, will the cab a step in.
And even then it will only. use its proxy rights to express
its will on apartheid. ;

And what #eems to us to be even worse, the Trustees
said they “apprgve” of the six Sullivan principles—six
rigorous guidelines (which were originally proposed two

ears ago by the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan of Philadelphia)
le. ions to use in trying to improve the
lot of blacks in South Africa— without even bothering to
suggest that Davidson would use its influence to urge
corporations to live up to them. |

The Sullivan principles are important and sensible.
They stress constructive action, such as improving black.
housing and training more biacks to fill managerial
positions, and tacitly discouraged irresponsible and
destructive actions such as attempting to wreck the
South African economy. The whole point of the Sullivan
principles is not that colleges “approve” them, but that
colleges, universities, and church organizations use their

_ influence to force corporations to comply. Do eb
like Davidson really have influence? “Many companies

To the Editor:

We are writing in response to
Dr. Brown Patterson’s letter of
the 23rd. He states that a
persistent problem of the Col-
lege is ‘‘that there is no agreed-
upon standard of student con-
duct in the dormitories or in
college-owned houses in David-
‘son.

“A related problem is that
even if there were such a
standard there is no agency,
organization, or group to en-
force it.”

In response to this we would
like to quote The Code of
Responsibility. The Preamble
paragraph two is as follows:

“The code of responsibility is
based upon the belief that
Davidson’s educational purpose
can best be advanced in a
context which emphasizes free-
dom as opposed to license.

“The aim of this code is to
encourage individuals to deve-
lop responsible judgment capa-
ble of directing their conduct
with a minimum of specific
prohibitions.

“An elaborate system of rules
Strictly enforced might promote
a surface conformity to the
standards of behavior desired,
but would not effectively serve
to develop the maturity of
character which is the aim of the
college.

“Rather, responsible matur-
ity is more. likely to develop
when a member of the college
community is both free and ob-
ligated to wrestle with princip-
les of conduct and to accept full
responsibility for his own ac-
tions and decisions.”’

Dr. Patterson asserts that
the Code speaks in general and
not specific terms; we assert
that it details various responsi-
bilities, in some ten sections,
ranging from academic to
social. How. much detail does
Dr. Patterson seek?

Finally, Dr. Patterson states
that there is no organization to |
enforce a code of ‘student con-

. duct. In the procedures for the

governance of student conduct
established by the Trustees,
section IV deals specifically

Davidson is in danger of becom:

ble for maintaining regulations

and management of the dorm.
He is the first to deal with
violations, and, if he is unsuc-
cessful, will refer them to the
Dean of Students who has the
option of taking action or
referring them to the Honor
Council.

Like the Honor Code, the
Code of Responsibility must be
maintained by the students. We
feel that the measures of free-

dom provided by these two

Codes makes campus life any-
thing but ‘‘‘poor, nasty, brut-
ish, and short.’”’

In fact, the Honor Code and
the Code of Responsibility pro-
vide for a “civilized mode of
behavior’ at Davidson that
would probably: be unmatched
by any other school of our
academic caliber, be it small
liberal arts or large state uni-
versity.

It is unfortunate that some
members of the faculty have
taken a few isolated incidents
and, blowing them up to gross
proportions, have made them
characteristic of the whole of
the student body.

Athletics

ing a college only for the
wealthy. Well, it is almost there
now. Athletics, especially foot-
ball and basketball, provide
many students with their only
means to attend a private
institution such as Davidson.

(4) In addition, a strong
athletic program has proven to
be the best tool in attracting
blacks to Davidson. Attempts
by the admissions people in
drawing blacks to Davidson
falls conspicuously short of
what the football and basketball
recruiters have done and will
continue to do as long as their
budgets are maintained.

One should not forget that
the athletes recruited by David-
son are students as well.

To the Editor:

We fear that the recent
criticisms concerning the size of
the athletic budget as compared

_ to the total budget and in face

of rising tuition might lead to a
outback in the athletic budget.
* Unfortunately, good athletic
programs, like good academic
programs, cost a lot of money.

healthy college atmosphere.

(1) Athletics, for both the
participant and the spectator,
provide a very beneficial release
from the pressures and tensions
of such an academically orient-
ed college as Davidson.

(2) Davidson is a small col-
lege in a small town. With such
a great emphasis on academics,

life for many can become very |

tedious and boring. For us
uncultured souls, lectures and

films do not improve thé situa-.
