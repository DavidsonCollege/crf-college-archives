Are Subjects

“SIX" JOHNSTON LEADS

Murray Mack and Fred Fur-
ness Are Speakers

“Polarized Light” and “llow
to” Become a Junior G-Man”
were subjects of the speeches
at the weckly meeting of the
Philanthropic Literary Society,
Tuesday night, May 5, in the
Phi Hall.

President “Six”-Johnston led the
society in the regular opening exer-
cises, including devotional and bus-
iness meeting. Then Murray Mack
spoke on the topic, “Polarized
Light.” He told of the discovery of
this new kind of ‘light,’a, discovery
which, it is hoped, will revolution-
ize night driving. As soon as it
is possible to equip automobile
headlights and windshields with a
glass especially fitted for polarized
light, all glare will be climinated
from night driving. 11 is also hoped
that three-dimensional motion pic-
tures will be possible with the aid
of polarization of light beams.

Fred Furness then gave a hum-
orous dissertation upon “How to Be-
come a Junior G-Man." He told
of the requirements for member-
ship, that the applicant send in to
headquarters two Post Toasties box
tops. He read extracts from the
instruction manual, notably the sec-
tion on “What te do when first you
reach the scene of a crime,” em-
phasizing the necessity of saving
all fingerprints. In conclusion the
speaker presented the possibility of
advancement to the rank of op-
‘erator, upon submission of more
box tops, along with a certain time
requirement of service.

For last night's meeting a debate
was planned, to be conducted by
Bill Black. Also piano selections by
J. EL Gailey. and W. C. Johnston
were scheduled:
