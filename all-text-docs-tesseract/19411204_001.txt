Letter Received

In letter of thanks received
from the ship, Monroe Bush, as
“Chairman of the Gift Fund, was
asked to “convey to the generous
young men of Davidson, who make
this timely gift possible, our cor-
dial thanks for their spirit and
Christian comradeship.”

Makes Statement :

With the letter was sent a copy
of the Tarheel, a weekly publica-
tion on board ship, which had an
account of the presentation, “As
a statement of our hope as well as
theirs,” they said’ “In the weeks
and months to come, a great number
of our shipmates, who have had
good Christian home training, will
find these Bibles a source of com-
fort and strength.”
