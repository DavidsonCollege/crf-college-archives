... Tenure System

(Continued From Page 1)

if a man is to teach at an in-
situation for the remainder of
his years he should get along
with his colleagues, and the in-
stitution should be able to ter-
minate his contract if they see
that they don’t agree with his
views.

But tenure means more than
academic freedom and econom-
ic security for a professor who
has dutifully served his seven
years apprenticeship. The ten-
ure debate is finally concerned
with how a university evaluates
its faculty. It asks who is fit to
teach at college, what his con-
tribution to the college com-
munity has been, and whether
he will continue that contribu-
tion after his job is secure.

As such, the question of tenure
at Davidson concerns everyone
in the academic community and
deserves careful scrutiny.

kegaard” and Brahm’s ‘Song

Issue Of Subsidized Football
Incites Debate At Open End

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

The question of subsidized
football was the focus of Mon-
day night’s Open End.

A panel comprised of Vice
President for Finance and De-
velopment C. David Cornell,
Professor of Economics Robert
L. Avinger, Head Football Coach
Dave Fagg and SGA Senator
Bill Meier, together with those
on the floor, tried to take a
look at the present football sit-
uation and possible alterna-
tives.

Cornell responded to the open-
ing question as to the amount
of income from game receipts,
stating- that in the academic
years 1969-70, 1970-71 and 1971-72
the football team raised $104,-
688, $31,197 and $142,357 respec-
tively.

However, Cornell added that
during the same time period,
football expenses (including re-
cruiting, insurance, equipment,
scholarships and game expens-
es) climbed from $307,847 in
1969-70 to $310,878 in 1970-71 and
to $325,821 in 1971-72.

These expense figures repre-
sent an excess of expenditures
over income of $203,159 in 1969-
70, $279,581 in 1970-71 and $183,-
464 in 1971-72, the sums per year
that the college contributes to
the football program.

The substantial drop in the ex-
cess of 1971-72 as opposed to
previous years is the result of
funds raised by the Wildcat
Club, a money-raising organiza-
tion which is expected to take
on more and more of the finan-
cial responsibility for football
in years to come.

With the help of the Wildcat
Club the excess of expenditure
is projected to decrease in 1972-

In regard to the Wildcat Club,
Fagg interjected that the foot-
ball staff has agreed to accept
financial aid from the college
for only one more year in order
for the club to realize its full
fund-raising potential, before it
takes on the task of supporting
Davidson football.

Throughout the entire session
came comments from many stu-
dents expressing the opinion
that since the football program
is so costly and that the team
apparently excites mediocre in-
terest, the logical approach

would be to make the program
non-subsidized as soon aS pos-
sible.

The college’s money could then
be applied to the improvement
of the so-called minor sports
such as baseball, tennis and
soccer.

Avinger suggested that the
problem need not be looked at
on an all-or-nothing basis, but
that there are degrees to which
a team can be subsidized and
perhaps this might be the ap-
proach to take rather than jerk-
ing the financial rug complete-
ly out from under the football
team.
