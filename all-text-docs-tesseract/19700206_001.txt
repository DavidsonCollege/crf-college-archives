Trustees Modify
Football

By RUSS MERRITT
and JOE SMITH
Associate Editors

At the conclusion of a two
day special session, David
son's Board, of Trustees has
passed a series of resolutions
which set. broad guidelines
for the future development
of the college as an institu
tion and which set definite
limits to varsity football's
claims .on the college's gen
eral fund,

These decisions were an
nounced by Board Chairman
Walter Lingle and Davidson
President Samuel Spencer at
a news conference following
the session's efd, on Feb
ruary 4.

The trustees dispelled ru
mors concerning the pending
death of subsidized football
at Davidson by voting to con-
tinue the established level of
the present inter-collegiate
program with certain stipu-
lations placed upon the col-
lege’s present financial sup-
port of football.

In a move designed to re

duce the immediate cost of
football to the college, the
trustees decided to reduce
the amount of funds given to
the football program from
the general college fund.
However, in compensation
for limiting the funds given
directly from the college, the

athletic fund has been sepa
rated from the living endow
ment, making it now possible
for financial aid to be given
directly to the football pro-
gram. For several years all
such contributions have gone
directly to and have been al
lotted from the general fund
of the college.

Under the new. subsidiza
tion plan, the college will
make available from its gen
eral funds a sum equal to 52
times the average grant made
to non-athletic scholarship
holders.

In terms of the present
value of scholarships, the ef
fect of the new plan is to re
duce expenditures on football

»

from the general fund by
$100,000. Lingle and Spencer
both pointed out that the
amount allocated would vary
with the value of the aver
age scholarship, a_ figure
which is continually rising

To keep the football pro-
gram at its present level, the
slack would be taken by
alumni contributions through
the Wildcat Club. Lingle ex-
pressed confidence that the
necessary funds could and
would be raised

The trustees decided that
the present inter-collegiate
basketball program should be
continued as is with a total
of 18 scholarships.

Support,
Set Future Goals

Also, the trustees decided
to maintain Davidson's mem-
bership in the Southern Cgn-
ference in all sports.

A second resolution affirm-
ed Trustee support for efforts
by the college to ‘enroll stu-
dents from a variety of raci-
al, economic, social and geo-
graphical backgrounds.”

Referring specifically to
the recruitment of black stu-
dents, the Trustees denied the
necessity of a quota system
and recommended that only
those applicants be admitted
who have “reasonable and
probable chance of academic
success.”"

SGA Senate Joins NSA

.« The Senate reversed a de-
cision of January 21 by vot-

The membership will cost
the SGA five dollars and will
last one year.

The motion passed in the
Senate stipulated that a de-

not because it knows them,
but because it fears them.”

In his opinion, Strong felt
that the purpose of the ‘Black

thinking concerning society

“But this brings up the
question of wants and needs.

**Needs are things which we
would call crucial to our sur-

feel that we need large sums

we were immobilized by

Strong termed this action

as “hustling backwards.”

Turning to the subject of
