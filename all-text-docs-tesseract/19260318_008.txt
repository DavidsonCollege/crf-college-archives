Dies From Stroke

Andy. Falls, colored bad ReRinaA for the col-

lege, died Sunday morning at 9:00 o'clock.

Andy was 55 years old and had been serving
the college for the past 20 years.’ He suf-
fered a stroke of apoplexy in January and
was carried to the hospital in Statesville,
| where he was at the time of his death. The
| funeral took place Tuesday afternoon when
he was interred in the Bethesda cemetery.
The local order of the colored Masonic
Lodge had charge of the funeral services.
Floral offerings were presented by both the
college and the student body.

Andy Falls was a faithful servant to Da-
vidson College during his long term of serv-
ice on the campus. He was strict to carry
out the letter and spirit of every wish of the
authorities. He was industrious and
saving, and from his earnings had accumulat-
ed considerable property near Davidson, The
Falls family will benefit by substantial in-
surance provided by the thoughtful husband
and father. The college has lost a valuable
servant.
