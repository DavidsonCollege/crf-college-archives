College Life in China Sub-
ject of Y Meeting

Education Has Done for the
Sleeping Giant.

Dr. Donald Richardson addressed the
Y. M. C. A. last Sunday evening in a
most unique and interesting manner on
the subject “College Life in China.” Doc-
tor Richardson is a graduate of David-
son and Princeton Theological Seminary,
and is, now serving humanity as vice-
president and teacher of Union The-
ological Seminary of Nanking, China.
He is in this country on furlough.

After giving a brief description of the
geography of China, the speaker stated
that the Chinese differ from Americans
in almost everything except their ed-
ucatoinal system. A Chinese mariner’s
compass points to the south. Instead of
shaking hands as English people do
they shake their own hands. Desert_is

purchase their coffins before their
death.
The educational system of China is

very similar to that of the United States
except that physical training is a new
thing in Chinese schools. Chinese child-
ren start to school at seven or eight
years of age. Formerly, girls were not
allowed to go to school, but now the
schools are open to both boys and girls.
China is at last beginning to realize the
value of education.

Several large American universities
have branches in China, among which
are Yale and Washington and Lee. The
largest Presbyterian Seminary in the
world is at Nanking. The Hangchow
Christian College, a large institution is
conducted jointly by the Northern and
Southern Presbyterian Churches.

Education has converted the great
empire of China into a republic. Amer-
ican educators in China are rapidly
cementing the friendship of China and
the United States and are molding
Chinese thought and civilization accord-
ing to American ideals. The door to
China is open wider than it has ever
been before. Unless the best of Amer-
ican manhood enters and gives China
their.sympathy and aid in solving their
religious problems the door may be
closed within the next ten years. Reli-
gion is their great need. Their hope is

STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS
FORM PHYSICS FRATERNITY

A Physics fraternity has been organ-
ized for the purpose of promoting
scholarship and friendship among the
students and faculty members of David-
son College who are interested in the
science of Physics.

This club is to be called Sigma Phi}
Sigma, and is to be the Alpha chapter. |

The present members are: Dr. J. M./I
Douglas, Prof. W. W. Woods, Prof. L.
M. Currie, R. M. Brice, 'M. C. Dew, W. K.
McCain, R. H. Poole, J. K. Price.

Especial emphasis is placed upon
scholarship—a grade of 88 being required
for one year before a student is eligible
for membership. The student members
are to be chosen from the Junior class
each year.

This fraternity will fill a long felt need
on the campus for an incentive to the
study of higher Physics and no. doubt
will soon be a strong rival to Gamma
Sigma Epsilon, the Chemical fraternity.

Contested by Both Teams.

| In a fast and exciting tournament on
jthe local courts Thursday afternoon the

tournament was marked by hard and
close matches throughout but, especially
by the brilliant playing of Ormond and

champions

That Davidson is really interested in
inter-collegiate tennis was clearly dem-
onstrated by the number of students and

nament. The two doubles matches were
split but the Wildcats took three out-of
four of the singles, thereby avenging
their last year’s defeat at the hands of
the Methodists.

Ormond -and Cunningham, D. C., de-
feated Vabor and Turrentine, T., 2-6,
6-1, 6-4.

Powell and Lefler, T., defeated Brad-
ley and Wilkinson, D. C., 6-4, 6-3.

Cunningham, D. C., defeated Turren-
tine, T., 6-4, 6-0. *

Lefler, T., defeated Wilkinson, D. C.,
6-1, 3-6, 6-1.

Bradley, D. C., defeated Tabor, T.,
6-1.

Ormond,
4-6, 6-0, 6-4.

With the completed
the tournament hung on the final match
between Ormond and Péwell. Powell
took the first set 6-4, but Ormond, show-
ing a reversal of form, took the second,
6-0. The final set was nip and tuck for
Powell was easily the star of the visitors.
With the score 4-all, Ormond, who had
worn his opponent down, walked away
with the last two games and the match,
4-6, 6-0, 6-4.

In the first doubles match Ormond and

Cunningham, D. C., were paired against
Tabor and Turrentine, T. This match
was a fight to the finish but the Red and
Black finally came out on top to the tune
of 2-6, 6-1, 6-4. The team work in this
match was splendid but it was marked
by the serving of Turrentine and the
speedy net-work of Cunningham.
In the second doubles Bradley and
Wilkinson, D. C., were paired against
Powell and Lefler, T. The visitors easily
walked away with this match, 6-4, 6-3.
Bradley and Wilkinson could not get to-
