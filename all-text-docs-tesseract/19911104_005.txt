SHOUT OUTS & Sell Outs

By Jay Ferguson

O.K., here’s the column for
this week, and Iam sorry to inform
you that there will be no random
and unrestricted dialogue between
ourtwoanonymous students, since
one of them, the one known to our
readers (all four of them if you
include our two anonymous stu-
dents and their mothers) simply as
“A:”, is being held hostage by a
roving band of rabid professors
armed with 8-10: page paper as-
signments.

Negotiations are underway
with this irrational terrorist group
to arrange his release, so wish him
luck and godspeed.

Well, since the column is all
mine this week, we’re going to do
the things that I like to do and talk
about the things that I want to talk
about. Therefore, before I begin,
let it be said that the things that
appear in this column this week do
not necessarily reflect any of the
views of “A:”, outside of the fact
that he took that picture with me on
the tracks, thinks exactly the same
way that I do, and without excep-

tion agrees with me concerning

every single aspect of God’s infi-
nite universe.

If you haven't already passed
out, turned to the Campus Living
section or thrown down your
Davidsonian in utter boredom and
disgust, I am about to move into
the meat and potatoes of this col-
umn,

T’ve had a lot on my mind this
week, and so I am going to just
ramble through my thoughts and

opinions, putting them in the form .

of shout-outs. Forthose who don’t
know the time, a shout-out is a
greeting, friendly message, or word
of support from anyone or any-
thing to any other one or thing. So
here are my shout-outs: . .

‘A shout-out goes to the Alpha
Phi Alpha interest group. I won't
dee here to see the fruits of your
labors, but I’m proud of you all for

finally bringing some real diver-
sity to the Davidson fraternity
system. Brothers gonna work it
out...

Td like to send a shout-out to
FLAG (I would hope by now that
most everyone is aware of what
that acronym stands for). Don’t be
discouraged by the hostility that
you will inevitably face in your
efforts. You have at least one
supporter, and I am speaking of
myself. When the charter comes
through, I am not ashamed to say
that I will be a charter member,
because I have a lot to learn, and I
know it...

This shout-out goes to SERCH.
I know a lot of you don’t really
know what SERCH is, and may
even feel that it is elitist. Rest
assured that it is not. Its members
represent a wide cross-section of
the campus, and its goal is to have
an extremely big impact by start-
ingsmall, SERCHis of amission,
and it won’t be long before the

wholecampusisinvolved...Finally,

astrong shout-out toall the women
and men who are involved in var-
sity athletics. I recognize that you
all are making huge sacrifices in
order to represent the best that
Davidson has to offer, and I admire
you greatly, Hang in there, there
really are students that support

Before I get too long-winded,
too sentimental, or both, I suppose
that I'd better wrap up these shout-
outs. But before I conclude the
column, and while I’m on the
general subject of “outs”, I -feel
compelled: to include:a little sec-
tion sending some perhaps not-so-
friendly messages to those that I
feel are sell-outs. I think that the
term sell-out is self-explanatory (if
there are any questions, however,
see me after class).

To the sell-outs who take it
upon themselves to write columns
when they know not that of which
they speak, take the time to ask

questions and attend forums,
speeches, and meetings so that you
can learn about your topic first-
hand. Youcan only know the time
if you take the time...

To the spineless lily-livered
sell-outs who make flyers to hang
uparound the campus proclaiming
anything that the producers of the
flyers are afraid to sign theirnames
to, realize that the true advocates
of free and responsible speech
claim their statements, full
responsibility for those statements
and taking the heat for those state-
ments too, if necessary... -

This goes out to the danger-
ous, hostile, narrow-minded, juve-
nile sell-outs who would attack
someone different from you by
throwing Commons food or using
any other weapon (yes, Commons
food is a weapon that I would like
to see banned, although the NRA
claims that all citizens have acon-
stitutional right to carry it). What
I’m saying is, if you throw food at
someone in the Commons. simply
because of the fact that they are
black, or white, or homosexual, or
any: other -ridiculous, fri
reason, watch your back because
one day you're gonna get yours...

Finally, this last one goes out
toall the sell-out students, faculty,
Fa or even college

editors who might try
to hinder the efforts of those who

are trying to establish FLAG, or to .

stand in the way of its creation.
Stepaside, because we need height-
ened awareness on this campus to
achieve heightened harmony, vei
besides, you cannot stop

bumrush. If you akietoeae
solution, you were,  prob-
lem...

Well, I'm sure that Pll
enough flack for the things I’ve
said so I'll quit before I get further
‘behind. To “A:”, please hurry
home, we miss you. To the rest of
you...Peace.

David Scott: Depth! Relevance!
All Hallowed Stories

Two Sundays ago the Depth/
Relevance crew linked elbows
‘round the boob tube, litsmall white
candles with paper wax catchers
(which, our arms being commit-
ted, we held in our mouths), and
harmonized the soothing lyrics of
Kum-ba-ya (which, our mouths
being committed, we sang with
our...)

Well, we seem to be running

short of organs, but it was touch-
ing. Wecommuned withthe flick-
ering images before us, our team,
our Braves, and wished them
thanks forthe joy they had brunged
us, and wished, to be more spe-
cific, that the losers had won. Then
the home teammates might have
merited a full column. They don’t.
The Braves have been officially
dumped as a topic for 1991.

Fortunately, however, Hallow-
een has not. Weird, bizarre, un-
seemly things frequented this past
All Hallows Eve, and Depth/Rele-
vance has the dirt on the most
intensely horrifying (ie. coolest)
episodes. Call this week’s feature
Suburban Legends Volume One.”

#1, Close Shave: Onthe night:

of Thursday, October 31,1991, the
lovely, innocent, pristine, crater-

dimpled, moon-eyed, permed |

(body wave) and Nike shod angel,
Suzy Softgum, age nine, bit half-
heartedly into the enormous apple
that .old Mrs. Buzzkil always

dumped on hopeful childrenevery -

Halloween, and which Suzy’s
mother was now making her eat.
Suddenly, Suzy’s youthful mo-
lars barrelled into something brittle
that crunched. “Mommy,” she re-
ported, “Something hard is in my
apple,” whereupon, ina fitofpanic,
Mrs. Softgum, recalling all the
DFO's (dastardly foreign objects)

* rumored to be embedded jin the

Halloween candy of her youth,
rushed the apple along with Suzy’s
entire bag of loot to the hospital for

X-rays.

The candy passed, but, buried
within the apple, doctors discov-
ered, after careful dissection, an
entire Bic razor with a hollow,
tooth-gouged handle. Disposable.
Fenians however, the blade .

. Was missing.
#2, That's Plenty: October 31,

{ 1991, Evening -- Little Otis, age
three, loved candy, dirt, andhis big .

brother Mike (age six). Mike,
however, could not stand Otis.
“He’salways getting me in trouble
or hanging around,” Mike alleg-
edly stated, “And everybody tries
to give him whatever he wants.”
Significantly, in terms of cute, Otis
ate Mike’s lunch.

“Mikey,” ingisted the mother -

of Otis and Mike at approximately
5:30, All Hallows Eve, “I wantyou

0 | to trick-or-treat with little Otis
7} tonight. It’s his first time, and he

needs his big brother to help him
out.” Little Otis beamed as his
mother drew him to her bosom,
and Mike felt like kicking the ur-
chin in the teeth.

At approximately 8:30 PM
Mike rang the doorbell at the home

- of Mr. and Mrs. Buzzkil,a friendly

and robust couple whose fading
sense of sound had not quenched
their zest for life. Mrs. Buzzkil

that little Otis dropped his little

plastic treat-pumpkin when she let
fall the crimson orb, Mr. and Mrs.
Buzzkil thought that this was fun-
damentally cute while Mike about
puked.

“You know,” bellowed Mr.
Buzzkil, possessor of an insatiable
sweet tooth for Greek pastries
which he loved to share with
friends, “I got a warm batch of
baklava just out of the oven and,
well, (heh, heh don’t tell the mis-
sus) I bet you kids have had about
enough apples.” He winked at the
missus, Lite Otiscaughta yummy
whiff of sweetness as the flaky
cubes, carefully wrapped in nap-
kins, were placed into his pump-
kin. “I. can’t wait to eat up my bog-
lava!” he declared.

Now little Otis always spoke
as ifanapkin had been shoved into
his mouth, This fact, in combina-
tion with the low battery in Mr.
Buzzkil’s hearing-aid generated the
following impulse which lodged
itself intractably within Mr.
Buzzkil’sbrain: “Could you please
heat up my big brother!”

Mr. Buzzkil, a man nothing if_,
not eager to please -- with his
conviction further reinforced by
the actuality that it was, in fact, a
cold night -- declared in his en-
dearing bellow, “Well, now that’s
mighty thoughtful of you, litle
Otis. I think we can take care of
your old bro’.”

Whereupon Mr. Buzzkil
snatched Mike up in his jovial,
bear-like manner and popped him
in the microwave.

“M’son justsent me this, Says
its the biggest they gotso the Missus
can cook just about anything in no
time flat. Works great on frozen
hamburger, too. Let’s see now,
guess we'll set’er on LOW.”

“Muuummphtt, Humpht,
Ummpttermum,” complained
Mike, his scarf unfortunately knot-
ted around his tonsils.

“Now, son, you just tell me
“When* after you get good and
warm, now,” and Mr, Buzzkil hit
START.

Shortly thereafter “Mikey Re-
ploded!” as little Otis exclaimed to
his bustling mother later that eve-
ning.

(An anonymous ' housewife
(whoshallremain nameless) tipped
off D/R to this tragic event. She
was not surprised at the actions
preity Mr. Buzzkil. whom, she

“Tried to choke my
daughter witha DFO.” She further
claimed that, as block parent, she
knew Mike to be somewhat of a
cad and asserted that “the beast got
what he deserved.”)

#3, Very Funny: Amember of
the Society left the Depth/Rele-
vance mobile parked on Main
Street across from the computer
center Thursday night. The very
difficult to deface auto received
direct hits from several eggs, the
yolks of which now forma surpris-
ingly thick gel on back windshield
and driver's side door, and one
chicken (maybe we found feath-
ers) -- the eggs, no doubt, coming
first (ormaybe we’ re just factually
disencumbered).

The thoughtless member was
rehabilitated through systematic
flagellation. He’s fine.
