Recently the sports staff of this newspaper sup-
ported the addition of scholarships in sports other
than basketball and football. This position has been
constant for several years.

A reply by John Scandling, a senior at Davidson,
suggested that we did not need to subject coaches
and players to ‘‘the tyranny of the expectations im-
plicit in scholarship support.’’ He claimed that ‘‘in-
tercollegiate athletics are non-scholarship en-
deavors here for the benefit of those students who
wish to participate.”’

His rationale is far from accurate.

Intramural sports are the non-scholarship en-

deavors which are here for the benefit of those who
wish to participate in such sports. But in-
tercollegiate athletics have an inherent element of
competition which involves the expectations of win-
ning.
Most, if not all, the coaches involved in the sports
in question would be more than willing to be sub-
jected to Scandling’s tyranny (which is hardly a
proper adjective). In my opinion, any coach who
does not want these scholarships because he is
afraid of some implicit set of expectations that will
follow, should not be coaching intercollegiate
athletics in the first place.

If the wrestling program is afraid of such a ven-
ture, then perhaps it should be shifted to a club
sport. Then they would not have the fear of any ex-
pectations at all, as far as the college is concerned.
But the club teams on this campus go out to win and
have the expectation when they begin. Even the in-
tramural teams do. (Just try to referee a game! )

Scandling admits that ‘“‘championships are im-
possible as long as we remain in the Southern Con-
ference.’’ But he is wrong here also. If there were a
few, say two or three, scholarships in tennis and
soccer, then these goals would be very reasonable.
They would also be possible in track and baseball.

Now, if this institution continues to approach
the philosophy of sports in the same way that it is
presently doing, we will be lucky to win anything in
a few years.

Jeff Frank, despite having a miraculous
recruiting year, will have his hands full trying to
finish third or fourth in the conference. The same is
gradually becoming true in soccer. In track and
baseball, doom has already taken its apparent toll.
As for wrestling, well, let Scandling condemn his
own sport.

I would be the first to admit that the number of
‘‘walk-ons’’ that compete intercollegiately for the
Wildcats is phenomenal and a credit to the school.
But Scandling goes even further.

He asks himself the question: Can we get a suf-
ficient number of Walk-ons to compete? He an-
swers yes.

Give him an A+. Sure, you can get 11 guys to
walk out on a football field, six on the tennis courts,
nine on a baseball diamond, etc. But, quite un-

good, as he walked only one
man in the seven inning game.

Richmond managed only
four hits during the contest,
and Tew allowed but two run-
ners to reach second, both in
the sixth.

With the exception of this
frame, the Spiders never
threatened.

In that inning, Tew started
out strong by getting two outs
on a fly to center fielder Mitch
Stone and a strikeout.

The Spiders then nicked the
Cat righthander for the singles
and a walk, but Tew stranded
the runners with an inning en-
ding strikeout.

That was all for Richmond’s
offense. In the top of the
seventh bouncers to third,
short and second ended the
ballgame and pressured the
shutout.

While Tew was shining on
the mound, the Cats’ bats
were hard at work. In the bot-
tom of the first Gary Pomeroy
and George Weicker slapped
two out singles to left center.

Catcher Mark Rodgman
then staked the Cats to a two
run lead with a double, giving
Tew all the runs he needed.

Jim Nichols dren a walk, but
the Cats weren’t able to score.

The Cats didn’t threaten
again. Todd singled to left
with two outs in the fifth, but
was left stranded. The Cats
played _ errorless ball
throughout, supporting Tew in
fine style.

Manire got the Spiders out
in the first despite a Pomeroy
error. A liner to third
baseman Dave Yearwood was
turned into a double play, and
the lefthander nipped a poten-
tial rally before it got started.

The Cats put two on in the
first, but Weicker flew to left
and Rodgman popped to first
ending the threat.

Manire was touched for a
run on two extra base hits, a
triple following a double. A

walking six, but sharp enough
to strike out the same number.
