Student Production Wins Praise

Continued from Page 9

illustrated by this actress.

Reese, with his booming voice
and imposing physical presence, gave
a powerful interpretation of George
Tesman. He managed to expose the
darker side of the seemingly harmless
Tesman without losing the audience’s
sympathy for the character.

Kosanovich as Judge Brack was a
perfect foil for Robinson’s Hedda. A

manipulator himself, he understands
Hedda better than any other character
in the play. Kosanovich played the
character as a mischievous seducer
who lacks the malice of Hedda.

Scofield made an appropriately
romantic and Byronic hero. He played
the melodramatic part of Lovborg with
enough restraint to make the character
seem believable.

Sarah Bayne, as the prying Aunt
Juliane, and Tracey Phillips, as the
maid, Berte, shine in their small but

significant parts as well.

The lighting arrangements by Joe
Gardener were subtle and shadowy.
The lighting provided haunting frames
for Hedda when she emerged from her
cave-like surroundings.

The scenery contributed to the
stuffy atmosphere which Hedda longs
to escape.

The costumes by Kathryn Schlee
also added to the sense of constraint
and repression which drive Hedda to
her final madness.
