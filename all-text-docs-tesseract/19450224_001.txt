Record Programs

Several years ago the Carnegie
Corporation placed in Davidson a
record library, of some 900 discs,
playing everything from pygmy
drums to Black and Tan Fantasy,
from Gregorian chants to John Phil-
ips Sousa. At the present time only
6 or 8 students ever listen to this
music. With the aim of giving these
recors a wider hearing and in order
to add some ‘entertainment to the
campus, the. local chapter of the
honorary music fraternity, Phi Mu
Alpha, is, sponsoring a series of
record “sessions”, to be held each
Friday night at 8:30 at the “Y”.
Each time a different brother will

Faculty Makes
Post-WarPlans

New Ruling Affects Athletics
_ and Admissions

Dr. Cunningham = recently an-
nounced that the faculty has ap-
proved the recommendations’ of the
Post-War Planning Committee with
regard to the policy that Davidson
will follow in athletics and physical
education. The recommendations
submitted are as: follows:

1, That the college has an obli-
gation in the field of physical edu-
cation just as in other fields, and
that it cannot well afford to ignore
this obligation; that therefore some
program of compulsory physical
training be continued. after the war
as a regular part of the require-
ments for graduation.

2. That the program of intra-
mural sports be expanded to include
the entire student body.

3, That it seems desirable tg con-
tinue competition in inter-collegiate
athletics, with such limitations as to
the number of games and the char-
acter of opponents as shall place no
undue stress upon inter-collegiate
sports. :

These regulations wiltbe very im-
portant, as they will take Davidson
out of the “big-time” gthletics and
limit its schedule to (those :
which are of the same Asie
own, In commenting, Dr, Cunning-
ham said, “The Davidson Faculty
looks with favor upon the college
limiting itself, in athletic competi-
tion, to institutions whose size and
whose quality of academic’ work
make for congenial institutinal re-
lations.”

Admissions

_Important changes in the policy
of the college in respect to admis-
sions were also announced as fol-
lows: ya

1, That our admission policy allow
for flexibility in the distribution of
required high school units in cases
of boys of high capacity, and that
some satisfactory standard of meas-
uring such capacity be sought.

2. That high school graduates
whose scholastic records will not

Queens-Davidson Dance

Held Saturday Night

Program For Q-D Day Planned
YMCA Announces Social
Plans For Semester

Saturday night, the second Queens
Davidson Day of the present school
year will be held on the campus.
The plans for the evening are as fol-
lows: a supper date with the girls
at the various boarding houses, an
informal dance in the college gym
from 7:30 until 10:30, and enter-
tainment at the YMCA from 10:30
until time for the girls to leave.

This social event is being spon-
sored by the Y cabinet, with Newt
Spencer in charge. He is making

arrangements with Edna Adams,
president af the Queens student
body.

The girls will arrive on the cam-
pus at 4:00 this afternoon and will
meet their dates at the Y. There
was a definite motive in arranging
‘for the girls to arrive earlier than
they usually do. It has been observed
that, on Queens-Davidson Days dur-
ing the past, the girls arrived on
the campus just in time to partici-
pate in the activities which were
‘planned for the affair, and conse-
quently never had a chance to see
much of the campus. Therefore it
was decided that the girls would be
invited over earlier, giving them a
chance to get acquainted with their
dates, and to see something of the
campus before supper.

The datce in the gym will be
chaperoned by the faculty, and mus-
W€ will be provided by a “piccolo”.
At the close of the dance, refresh-
méhts will be served at the Y, and
various types of entertainment will
be provided by both Queens girls
and local ‘students.

All students who do not have
dates for the dance are cordially in-
vited to attend, and it is hoped that
a large representation of the student
body will be present to insure the
scucess of the dance.

Now that the faculty regulation
permitting dances on the campus

Chapel Talk By
Rev. G. A. Hudson

Missionary To China Speaks
On Japanese
pReverend George A. Hudson,
Presbyterian missionary to China,
was guest speaker at Chapel on
Monday, February 5. Mr, Hudson
was born and reared in China and
has been a missionary to that coun-
try for twenty-one years. He re-
turned to America on the Gripsholm
in December, 1943, after being in-
terned in a Japanese concentration
camp for seven months. Since his
return he has stirred audiences _
throughout the country with the tale
of his adventures, and the David-
son student’ body showed great in-

terest in his address.

After relating his own exciting
experiences, with many light
touches, Mr. Hudson outlined for
the audience his five point program
for the Far East, which has been
printed and circulated in pamphlet
form by the Foreign Missions com-
mittee of the Presbyterian church.
As a basis for permanent.peace
in the East, he recommends “tha
utter destruction of Japanese mili-
tarism”. Mr; Hudson’s own son was
killed in action on Bougainville Is-
