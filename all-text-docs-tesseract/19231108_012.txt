|NORTH CAROLINA’S CHIEF

| EXECUTIVE SECURED TO
SPEAK AT Y. M. C. A. VESPER
SERVICE

Students of Davidson Will Have
Honor of Hearing Governor
Morrison as Religious
peaker

| Governor Cameron Morrison, of North
Carolina, has been secured by the Y. M. C.
A, to speak at the weekly vesper services, at
Shearer Hall, next Sunday evening.

Governor Morrison has made a steady rise
from a poor boy to the office he now holds,
He was. born in Robeson County, where he
attended school. Very early in life he began
the study of law and opened offices in Rock-
ingham, N. C. After having practiced there
for several years he moved his offices to
Charlotte. This was about 20 -years ago.
He enjoyed an extensive and very successful
practice there until his overwhelming defeat
of Col. J. J. Paker in 1920 placed him in the
gubernatorial seat in Raleigh.

An actiye interest has been taken by Goy-
jernor Morrison in affairs of state in North
\Garalina for several years. Individuals and
{the press unite in calling him one’ of the

$|Tar Heel State’s foremost citizens and one

of the most progressive men in the state in
educational and extension work, especially
the construction and maintenance of a per-
manent, hard-surfaced system of roads in
the st He can be called North Carolina's
| progressive governor, for the state has forg-
ed to the front more during his incumbency
jthan in many previous years. Strides have
{been and are being made that make North
Carolina known now as the union's most
| progressive state.

Governor Morrison is a devout Christian,
| He was a member of the Second Presbyte-
tian Church during his residence in Char-
lotte.

The students will find it a rare treat to
hear his address Sunday evening. Governor
Morrison is a gifted orator with a delivery
pleasing to the public and especially so to a
student. The subject of his address is not
yet known, but it is certain that a man of
such calibre will bring to the “Y” a message
worthy of hearing.

KN MeCnERS. APPROVED BY

It seems to be the prevailing fashion
of the campus for all gentlemen of note
to don those abbreviated trousers known
from boyhood days as “short breeches.’
Every day they become more and more
plentiful.

It was not such a surprise when the
noted fashion model and _ golf-hound,
Johnny Bachman put them on. Neither
was it a jolt when beloved Charlie Mc-
Crary chose that garment to conceal
his nether parts. But from then on it
seemed as if the notion to look good in
“short breeches” was the only way.

They are being used for more pur-
poses than one. For instance take
Hippo Houch. While hopping the train
the other day he was caught by Cop
Johnson. He simply donned “short
breeches” for a disguise. No doubt he
thought he looked innocent in them.

Now take Allison, for example. When
he found that wearing glasses was not a
sufficiently distinguishing’ mark for a
gentleman of his position, he put on
golf breeches with red stockings.

Our friends, Faison and Shepherd, look
like a pair of Apollo when they parade
across the campus. The student body
shows their appreciation by-yelling fire.

Now, these are the main celebrities.
The custom has reached a high tide of
popularity. There are two things to sug-
gest before the boys put ontheir win-
ter underwear. These are: (1) That the
football- team be presénted with short
breeches at the end of the season; (2)
That the basketball team be given them
as costumes. They would look so snap-
py on the floor,

Henderson says he has a job sewed up
in ‘a tailor’s establéshment.

Hallowe'en night at Davidson probalbly did
not witness the promenading of ghosts and

| Passing from the campus to various build-

notice the effects of the ingenuity Of these
clever marauders. One professor was amply
supplied with a box of telephone line con-
struction tools, possibly furnished to assist
him in excavating his desk from the pile of
rubbish under which it was hid. Another's
table was replaced with an ash can. An-
other's blackboard was greased and his usual
blackboard talk was done away with for the
day. Still another’s room showed evidences
of having housed a cow for a considerable
time, for chalf dust was sprinkled down with
sweet milk.

The buildings were befittingly arrayed with
suitable decorations. Phi Hall was veritably

looked more like terror hall, was torn topsy

silenced to muteness by stuffings on the in-
side.
