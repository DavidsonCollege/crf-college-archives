Tax May Be Cut for Families of Students

New Haven, Conn.—(1.P.)—A
bill which would’ give parents of
college students a reduction in
their income tax payments and
help more young people get a col-
lege education will be introduced
in Congress during the current
session. The idea behind the
present bill originated with the
Yale Alumni Board about 18
months ago.

The proposed legisjation would
grant an income tax credit of 30
per cent of the tuition charges or
educational fees paid for students
ubove the 12th grade. Based on
a formula suggested by the Resolu-
tions Committee of the Taxation
Section of the American Bar As-
sociation, it would provide the
same beriefits to all taxpayers sup-
porting college students, regardless
of their income,

Assuming a charge of $500 for
tuition or education fees, the tax-
payer would deduct $150, or 30 per

cent, from his federal income tax
bill. Similar legislation proposals
in the past were based on a plan
of making the cost of tuition and
fees deductible from income. The
new plan about to be introduced
by several Congressmen this year
is believed to be better as it pro-
vides identical benefits to all tax-
payers, and is of particular advan-
tage to those in low-income
brackets.

The new bill limits the tax credit
to tuition and educational fees on
the assumption that other costs,
such as room. board and travel,
are covered in part by the $600
deduction now allowed for a de-
pendent by income tax law. A ceil-
ing under the bill. Thus, that por.
tion of any tuition charge above
$1,500 per year would not count
in any further tax credit.

Scholarships, fellowship grants,
or education and training allow-
ances would reduce the maximum
on which a person could obtain
income tax credit. Thus, if the
tuition charges were $1,000 a year,
toward which a student received
a scholarship of $400, his income
tax credit would be 30 per cent
of $600, or $180.

Davidson College was one of two
tolleges in the Confederacy which
did not close its doors during the
Civil War and Reconstruction. It
was the only college in North
Carolina which survived those
years without inoctivity for at
least a year.

through the Ministry of Education.
These include funds for a year of!
study in an institution of higheri

Since the number of supplemen-'
tary travel grants is mited, there
can be no assurance of such aid
to recipients of the above-described
awards. Grantees should have
funds, therefore, to pay their own
travel and incidental expenses.

The Swedish Government is giv-
ing three fellowships through the
Sweden-America Foundation. These
awards are administered in the
United States by the Institute of
International Education and the
American - Scandinavian Founda-
tion. The stipends cover room,
board and tuition expenses at a
Swedish university. Candidates
must pay their own travel.

Preference is given to candi-
dates under 35. Other eligibility
requirements are: (1) U.S. citizen-
ship; (2).a bachelor’s degree from
an American college or university
of recognized standing by the time
of departure: (3) demonstrated
academic ability and capacity for
independent study; (4) good moral

But for us, the greatest thrill of

Pete began to move out at about
three quarters; he still opened up.
Finally with his steady pace hold-
ing him near the top, Pete began
his kick a little less than half-way
through the final lap. Then he
really threw it wide open, a kick
to match the best. However, it
was started just a little too late
... Ben Angle of VMI won but
Pete pushed him, probably more
than he has been pushed the last
two seasons. Angle won in the time
of 4:24.6 Pete's time was approxi-
mated at 4:25.6. This was six and
a half seconds better than his pre-
vious time and only 3.6 seconds
off of the school record. What
better improvement can one ask?
Pete still has a lot of potential
left in him .. . and he does his
best when the competition is the
toughest. Let’s hope for a lot of
good competition for him this year.

Series of Sociology
Films Is Scheduled

Davidson College’s Sociology De-
partment has announced q series
of films concerning anthropology
to be shown on campus under co-
sponsorship of the College Union
Audio-Visual Committee.

The series consists of eight films
to be screened in pairs at four
separate showings. The first of
these performances is scheduted
for 4 p.m., March 9, in the Col-
lege Union Ballroom. Subsequent
dates for showings will be March
23, April 6, and April 20.

Each pair will pertain to an in-
dividual anthropological region of
the earth. Geographical areas to be
depicted will be Southeast
Asia, the Orient, Africa, and the
Indian realms of the Americas.
The initial duo are entitled
“Nomads in the Jungle” and
“Tropical Mountain Island” and
deal respectively with Malaya and
Java,

The movies belong to an award-
winning series issued by United
Films and termed “The Earth and
Its Peoples.” They are being ex-
hibited at Davidson in connection
with the Anthropology course
catalogued as Sociology 32.

Despite the obvious educational
unsights to be derived from these
presentations, Davidson students
will undoubtedly find them in-
teresting to witness.
