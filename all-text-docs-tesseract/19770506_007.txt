At least three quarters of
the faculty had to be members
of “‘some branch of the Pres-

more, each full professor was
inaugurated at. Commence-

service in a ceremony in which
he was required to give affir-
mative answers to three theo-
logical questions.

As early as 1962.a group of
‘professors who had already
taken the ‘‘vow’’, as it was
called, and all of whom were
Davidson graduatés, reques-
ted the Trustees to modify
these provisions of the By-
Laws. After a great deal of
discussion among all interes-
ted parties, the Education
Committee of the Board of
Trustees proposed, in the
place of the inauguration cere-
mony, a series of written ques-
tions to be administered to all
ranks of the faculty aimed at
eliciting an expression of
Christian commitment.

This proposal, which was
set forth in October 1964, was
opposed by a large element of
the faculty and by some of the
trustees. In its place the
Trustees approved, in April
1965, a restatement of the
relevant By-Law, according to

Criticism has arisen concer-
ning the Senate’s handling of
the tenure controversy. Mark
Rabil, a member of the task
force, commented, ‘‘I think

tions signed. I don’t know

Senators. We feel that some-
where along the line- publicity

In defense of the Senate,
President Young stated, ‘The
SGA has acted with authority
on the case statement and
petition. I’m proud of the
work they’ve put into this
issue.”

In conclusion, Young ex-
pressed a hope ‘‘that the
Trustees will come out with a
letter of intent to reevaluate
and change Davidson’s pre-
sent tenure policy.”

The Professional Affairs
Committee of the Davidson
faculty proposed a change in
Davidson’s tenure policy:

“We therefore urgently re-
quest the Trustees of David-
son College to remove the
religious requirement for ten-
ure from their By-Laws and
entrust the matter of recrui-
ting Faculty members to the
President and other officers of
the college, using as their
guide the Statement of Pur-
pose of-the college. In.this
way, we believe the Christian
character of the college can be
nurtured and sustained with-
out hindering its development
as an institution of liberal
learning.”’

This statement was ap-
proved overwhelmingly by
Davidson's faculty at their

Tuesday meeting, 64 to 7.

which Davidson College was
said to seek ‘‘as permanent
members of its faculty only
those who, in addition to their
academic qualifications, are
committed to the Christian

faith,”
The issue of arose
again in the acade ‘year

1968-69. President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. had appointed, in
the fall of 1968, a Study
Commission on Davidson Col-
lege’s.Chruch Relationship,
composed of students, faculty
members, administrators, and
_trustees. One of the questions
that Commission concerned
itself with was the college’s
policy concerning faculty rec-
ruitment.

_ In the course of its work the
Commission solicited the
views of students, faculty, and
alumni. It asked department
chairmen about their experien-
ces in recruiting, specifically
whether the religious restric-
tions in the By-Laws had

inhibited them in their search] |

had inhibited them in their
for the best scholars and
teachers who were available
for positions here.

"It also asked the deans of
other church-related colleges
whether those colleges oper-
ated under the kinds of rest-
rictions Davidson did. The
Commission found, in brief,
that students and faculty de-
sired a change, as did a
significant proportion of the
alumni; that the réligious rest-
rictions in the By-Laws had
served as a negative factor in
faculty recruiting; and that no
other chruch-related colleges
of Davidson’s academic
standing had formal religious
requirements for its faculty.

In its final report to the
President in June 1969, the
Commission recommended
that all formal religious re-
quirements for members of the
faculty contained in the By-
Laws be removed. Those re-
quirements had been signi-
ficantly altered since the early
1960’s.

But they still included the
following features: the college
was said to seek as members of
the faculty ‘‘only those who, in
addition to their academic
qualifications, are committed
to the Christian faith’’; the
administration of the college
and the Education Committee
of the Trustees were ‘‘to
satisfy themselves as to the

Christian faith of every indi- —

vidual eligible to be a member
of the Faculty with tenure’’;
and ‘‘a majority of the Faculty
and a majority of the full
profesors’’ were required to be
“members of some branch of
the Presbyterian Chruch.”’

In place of these restric-
tions, the-Commission recom-

mended that “the Dean of the’

Faculty inform every pres

pective faculty member of the
Christian aims of the college,
using for this purpose the
Statement of Purpose of Dav-
idson College,’’ and that he
satisfy himself that the pros-
pective faculty member was
“willing, conscientiously and
wholeheartedly, to teach in a
community having these
aims.”

The Commission noted that
not all faculty members re-
cruited in thle way would,
necessarily , be Christians, and

that there would be circum-
stances in which it would be
‘“‘desirable, for educational
reasons, to recruit non-Chris-
tians.”

One of the results of the
Commission’s recommenda-
tions and of the discussions
‘which ensued was that the
By-Laws were revised in
October 1971. Most of the
religious restrictions con-
tained in the By-Laws were
removed.

There were, however, two
important ones which re.
mained. These were: that the
President was to make certain
that each person appointed to
the faculty was fully aware of
the purpose of the college, as
expressed in the Statement of
Purpose, and was prepared
‘to uphold and seek to in-
crease its (the college's) effec-
tiveness as an institution of
Christian learning’; and that
“any Faculty member given
tenure must be an active
member of a _ Christian
church.”

The revised By-Laws were
not, however, accepted with
universal approbation. In Oct-
ober 1972 all the ordained
members of the faculty signed
a statement asking the faculty
and the President to request
the trustees to alter those
sections of the By-Laws pre-
scribing ‘‘a religious test for
appointment to the faculty.’’

As a substitute for the
religious restrictions con-
tained in those sections, the
statement recommended the

“Since this is a college

proponents’of the Christian
faith on the teaching faculty of
the college.

nent appointments to the fac-
ulty to those professing a

In May 1973, the faculty
adopted overwhelmingly a
resolution stating that there
was ‘‘an urgent need to rede-
fine the policy of the college in
relation to the recruitment of
members of the faculty.’ It
stated the faculty’s belief
“that the President and other
officers of the college should
be entrusted with the respon-
sibility of recruiting such fac-

By-Laws was made by the
Trustees on 26, 1974,

That revision, which was
adopted in February 1975,
states that the President is
directed ‘‘to seek out and
secure as officers and Faculty
members Christian men and
women who are not only
highly competent but who
understand and respond to the
implications of their commit-

‘ment as Christians.”

It’ adds that the trustees
may ‘‘in special circumstances

respects the Christian tradi-
tion without commitment to
all its tenets,”’ but that such
cases would ‘‘necessarily be
