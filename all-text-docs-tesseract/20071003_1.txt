Development through history

By PiERCE TRUMBO
Managing Editor

“Development through history”
marks the first in a series of articles
concerning town development.
Next week, The Davidsonian will
continue its history of town devel-
opment to provide readers with fur-
ther background on current issues.
Thereafter, we will cover these
issues— town development, afford-
able housing, upcoming town elec-
tions, the Light Rail, the College’s
relationship with the Town, the
development of West Davidson,
etc. We recognize that these issues
are complex and sensitive, and, for
this reason, we invite town officials
and community members to repre-
sent themselves in their own words
in our Perspectives pages. —The
Editorial Board

1960s- 1970s:

Following the completions of
Lake Norman in 1963 and of I-77
in 1968, Marine World approached
the town of Davidson about build-
ing a theme park near the lake.
According to the Sept. 14, 1973
issue of The Davidsonian, Marine
World would have included, in
addition to sea animals, “a yacht
club, rows of boutiques and exclu-
sive shops, numerous restau-
rants...chapels and theatres...[and]
a convention center composed of

high-rise hotels and exhibit halls.”
But the town, backed by the vocal
Davidson Citizen’s Association,
refused to run a sewer line to the
theme park site and thereby reject-
ed the development proposals.
This marked one of the Town of
Davidson’s first and most fantastic
experiences with development, but
concerns about town development
predate the rejection of Marine
World. In 1972, “The Davidson
Community Development
Committee” solicited a company to
report on the town’s prospects for

development. The company—
Hammer, Greene, Siler and
Associates — anticipated what

many embrace as truth today: that
an expanding Charlotte and the
newly completed 77 would change
Davidson.

In 1972, Davidson consisted of
600 homes, half of which were
associated with the College. For
this reason and because the College
predated the Town of Davidson,
the College shaped town policy.

As current town planner Lauren
Blackburn has said, “The College,
up until about 20 years ago, in my
opinion, kind of ran things.”

The community’s concerns
reflect this influence; priorities
ranged from embracing “enlight-
ened zoning policies” to maintain-

Since the spring of 2006, there
has been a notable piece of
Patterson Court missing from the
Davidson landscape.

The Kappa Alpha Order (KA),
situated in the house closest to Vail
Commons, was suspended for over
a year due to violations of the
College’s and the KA national
organization’s risk management
policies.

The fraternity has since returned
to campus with the hope of rein-
venting its image at Davidson,
recently hosting its first open party.

The Kappa Alpha Order is a
nationally recognized. fraternity
that was founded at Washington
College, now known as
Washington and Lee University in
Lexington, VA, in 1865.

It bases its beliefs and ideals on
the traits espoused by General
Robert E. Lee, who was president
of Washington College from direct-
ly after the Civil War until his
death in 1870. The Sigma chapter
was established at Davidson in
1880.

Since its inception, KA has been
an active member of Davidson
College and graduated such

Secretary of State Dean Rusk 731.

In the spring of 2006, the
National Office of the Kappa

Alpha Order suspended the Sigma

chapter of KA at Davidson College
for risk management violations.

Specifically, those risk manage-

ment violations included hazing
infractions towards new members
of the fraternity.

The KA National Office and the
College conducted joint investiga-
tions that led to a joint decision to
suspend the Sigma Chapter’s char-
ter.

Due to the KA brothers’ over-
whelming cooperation, however,
the period of suspension was one-
and-a-half years instead of the
standard three years.

Beginning with a series of inter-
views by the National Office in
May 2007 to discuss the problems
with Sigma chapter, KA started the
process of returning to campus.

The true process of rebuilding
KA did not begin until this semes-
ter, when the KA National Office
sent a provincial representative to
coordinate the reeducation of KA
members at Davidson.

Noise makes noise

By SUMMERLEE WALTER
Editor-in-Chief

Professor of German and
Director of the Center for
Interdisciplinary Studies Scott

Denham introduced a motion to
address noise levels on Patterson
Court at the faculty meeting on
Tuesday.

According to the motion, “[t]he
faculty encourages the Dean of
Students and the staff of the Dean
of Students office [to] work with
the College’s Director of Public
Safety to enforce the Town of
Davidson Noise Ordinance on
campus as so empowered by the
Town of Davidson Municipal
Code.”

After the faculty discussed the
motion, Denham withdrew it
because he intended the motion as
a “discussion-prompting move—
purely symbolic.”

The, motion resulted from an
incident that occurred on Sept. 19
when Denham, who lives near the
College, called campus police to
report that noise from what proved
to be a registered Wednesday night
Court party had woken up his
daughter at approximately 11:30
p-m.

When the dispatcher informed
him that he could not report a com-
plaint without a street address,
Denham bicycled over to the Court
to find the street address of the
house from which the noise origi-
nated.

Upon arrival at the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon (SAE) house, Denham
reported the address to dispatch
and then entered the house and
asked the Risk Manager to tum
down the music.

According to him, the Risk
Manager allegedly responded that
because the event was a registered
party, the house was allowed to
play music from 9 p.m. until 1 a.m.

SAE brother Will McGuire 710,
however, claims that the students
compromised with Denham by cut-
ting sound to their outside speakers
while continuing to play music
inside.

When Campus Police arrived,
the officers asked students to turn
down the music but then explained
that, because the music was within
the College’s guidelines for parties,
Denham’s complaint was ground-
less.

According to some faculty mem-
bers, the validity of that statement
is debatable.

The College’s Red Book, in its
“Regulations for Student
Organizations” section, mandates
that “[aJll student organizations are
expected to follow local, state and
federal laws.”

For faculty members in favor of
the motion, the noise level that
often emanates from Patterson
Court conflicts with the section of
the Town of Davidson’s municipal
code that states: “[i]t shall be

and present

By SUMMERLEE WALTER
Editor-in-Chief

In light of the recent campus
involvement in the Jena 6 cam-
paign and the discussions of
diversity that President Ross’s
Opening Convocation remarks
encouraged, The Davidsonian
decided to investigate both the
history of race on campus and
the steps that administrators
are taking to address the issues |
that the campus faces today.

In 1920, members of
Davidson College’s Georgia |
Club staged their “Quips and
Cranks” yearbook photograph
as a fake lynching. The young

; men aimed shotguns and pis-

tols at an African-American
man, probably a College
employee, with a noose around
his neck.
According to Grey
1993 Kelley
Honors Thesis “Trapped by
Tradition: Davidson’s African-
American Community from
1930 to 1970,” the Davidson
community, like the majority
of Southern towns and col- |
leges, grappled with race rela- —

and, as is true at many other
colleges, Davidson students
contributed both positively and |
negatively to the changing
social dynamic.

In 1968, for example, Ralph
Johnson’s and Hood Norton’s
barber shops in the Town of
Davidson served African-
American students but not
African-American townspeo-
ple. In response to the inequal-
ity, Davidson students wrote a
letter to faculty and administra-
tors to express their disap-
proval of the policy.

“We feel that this policy is
unfair, unjust and immoral. We
simply feel that a community
barber shop should be open to
all members of the communi-
ty,” they wrote in the April
1968 letter.

Students, faculty and admin-
istrators then boycotted the
barbershop until the propri-
etors’ issued a written state-
ment promising a new policy.
Some students also supported
and demonstrated in a commu-
nity protest march. Thanks in |
part to the students’ efforts, the
barber shops integrated toward
the end of 1968.

From Timberlake’s account,
it appears that most of the
College’s historical efforts to
combat racism were similarly
student-led.
