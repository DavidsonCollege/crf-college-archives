Ten November 1, 1974 The Davidsonian

Cross-Country Ends With 9-3 Record

The 1974 version of the
cross-country team has come
to the conclusion of its most
successful season ever, and
are much the worse for the
wear.

Monday, Martin’s
Marauders were wiped off the
map in Virginia, losing 15-46 to
a powerful Richmond team.
The Cats dual meet record is
thus complete at 9-3.

The race was a debacle for
the Cats. Sterling Martin sum-
med it all up as he collected
the place-markers, ‘‘terrible,
terrible.’’

It is no bad reflection on the
team, though, because they
have completed an incredibly
exhausting schedule, running
12 times in a month.

Also, Richmond’s team is
scholarship-subsidized, which
is to say, they are mer-
cenaries in comparison to
Davidson’s solid yeomen, who
run for the sheer hell of it. So
there.

Coty Pinckney was. sixth
overall, and first for the Cats.

Bill McClement and ‘“‘Lube’’’

Deal finished eighth and ninth,
and ‘Old Reliable’ Lauten-
sack and Jeff ‘‘the Cat inthe
Hat” Neikirk rounded out
Davidson’s first five.

The last challenge for the ’74
Cats and the epochal seniors
of ’75 will come Saturday in
Williamsburg, Va. in the
conference meet.

Senior Lautensack predicts
“a fifth place finish at best,
and eighth place at worst.’
Captain Rick Bell summed up
the problem facing the Cats.

“Our biggest difficulty will
be getting psychologically up
for one more run. It’s been a
fun year, but it’s been a long
one,”’ Bell said.

It’s been a good year, too,
Captain Bell. The Cats did not
lose a single meet to a
similarly-constituted team;
all defeats were at the hands
of scholarship schools. And
some scholarship programs
went down to defeat before the
Marauders nevertheless,
notably Wake Forest and High
Point. Then, too, Citadel, VMI,
and W & L were dazed and
confused to come up short
against Davidson.

The 9-3 record that the team
compiled. is unprecedenced,
and is all the more out-
standing in comparison with
the records of the past few
years: 7-5 (73), 5-5 (72), 5-10
(71), and 1-14 (’70). In ad-
dition, Pinckney’s five con-
secutive first place finishes
were a remarkable
achievement, as were the
sweep of victories over arch-
rivals such as The Citadel,
Wake Forest and VMI.

Regardless of how the Cats
fare on Saturday, the 1974
Wildcat Cross Country season

will not be soon forgotten, at
home or abroad.

P.E. Credit Offered |
By Outing Club Trip

The purpose of the Outing
Club is, according to its
president Mike Russell, to
make the outdoors easily ac-
cessible to the Davidson com-
munity. In this sense, all of
Davidson is a ‘‘member” of
the Outing Club. For this
membership, the club
provides a number of ser-
vices, among which is an in-
formation library.

Russell said. that this con-
tains a bibliography of books
in the college library on a wide
range of subjects, a set of
maps of the mountainous
regions of North Carolina and
information’on environmental.
concerns. _

The Outing Club also views
itself, Russell stated, ‘in an
educational role in the out-
doors. Towards this end, it is
providing a_ series of
‘seminars’ to the community.
The first of these covers the
subject of mountaineering and
will take place on the weekend
of Nov. 8-10.

“‘These seminars are geared
towards the individual who
knows little to nothing about
the subject but who wishes to
learn the skills necessary to
participate safely in any
future related activities,”’ he
added.

The mountaineering
seminar will consist of a three
day long session. The first
Friday evening will consist of
safety procedures and basic
knot-tying instruction. The

Saturday and Sunday sessions

will take the participants to.

Hanging Rock, above Win-
ston-Salem, and actually
teach the proper climbing
techniques.

As an added incentive, the
P.E. department has agreed
to give credit to any student
who successfully completes
the course.

The Outing Club has added
another dimension to its mem-
bership, Russell continued.
“For those people who wish to
support the work of the Outing
Club, there is
classification labeled ‘voting
member.’ To obtain this
Status, the student need only
pay two dollars to the club.”’

Russell indicated that for
this sum the donor receives a
number of ‘‘worthwhile
benefits, ”’ including the right
to vote in all elections and
referendums, permission to
check out Outing Club rental
equipment at no charge, anda
club group membership
discount of, equipment pur-
chases.

The Outing Club. does not
wish to limit itself to the
students alone, Russell in-
dicated. ‘We therefore are ex-
tending our services to the
community. Established
already is an Explorer Post
jointly sponsored by the club
with APO to reach the young
people in Northern Mecklen-
burg,” he explained.
