C. Burts, dean of students.

Explaining the change, Burts
Said that in the past it was al-
most time for the mid-semester
report by the time grades had
been figured, compiled and re-
corded by the registrar.

It is felt that this new ap-
proach will be just as beneficial
to the freshmen while relieving
some of the work of the admin-
istration.

Another change brought about
by the new plan involves the
dropping of courses. This year
freshmen are required to take
only 14 hours, but many are
taking more. Those sfudents
with 17 or 18 hours may drop
3 course within four days after
the first official grade report
(the mid-semester grade report
due Saturday, Nov. 21) without
penalty. if they have the con-
sent of their advisers.

Burts said, however, that all
freshmen will be responsible for
at least 12 hours of academic
work plus ROTC the first sem-
ester.

‘Golden

By DICK CANNING
Davidsonian Feature Writer
A large portion of liberal

politics was served up to an
appreciative student body
Thursday as Jewish light-
ning struck Davidson in the
person of Harry Golden.

Golden payed a_ short but
whirl wind visit: to Davidson un-
der the auspices of the Great
Issues series, and spent several
hours here cspensing humor,
Jewish philosophy. and Mberal
politics in large doses.

A resident of Charlotte, Gold-
en is the editor of Carolina
Israelite, which specializes in
commentary, -humor, and just
about anything Golden happens
to be interested in at the mo-
ment. He is also author of two

' best-selling buofks Only In Am-

erica and For 2¢ Plain, as well

. a8 a biography of Carl Sand-

burg.

He is known by most liberals
as America's foremost Jew, and
by liberals and conservatives
alike as America’s most contro-
versial Jew.

As a speaker for tire Great Is-
sues series, Golden spoke on
what has been his favorite topic

YRC Presidential Poll Shows
Goldwater Holds Slight Edge

In a poll of the Student Body
the Young Republicans Club
found that a greater percent of
those polled support GOP can-
didate Barry Goldwater for
President over Lyndon Johnson.

For Goldwater 43 percent cast
their support. Johnson trailed ‘
on the Davidson campus with 39
percent of the students support-
ing him. Eighteen percent indi-
cated they were undecided in
their choice.

From the results of the student
poll conducted several weeks
ago by THE DAVIDSONIAN in
which Goldwater received 31
percent of the student vote, the
Young Republicans decided that
they could have a very active
organization on campus. They
have organized a chairman’ on
each hall of the dorms, the grass
roots level of dormitory life.

Under the leadership of these
hall chairmen, an effort has
been made to contact all stud-
ents to obtain their answer to
four questions: ‘‘Do you support
the candidacy of Barry Gold-
water?’’, “Are you willing to
work for his election?’’, ‘*Are
you eligible to vote?’’, and ‘Are
you undecided about whom to
support?"

are limited.

The English Consort of Viols |
had its origins in Liverpool.
England, where Marco Pallis
started his first consort follow-
ing a series of concerts there
by Arnold Dolmetsch and his
family. Dolmetsch’s festival at
Haslemere provided an oppor-
tunity for members of the group
to take an auxiliary part and
thus widen their experience.

The first era of the consort’s
history was ended in 1939 by the
outbreak of the war. The Eng-
lish Consort was reconstituted
when Pallis and Richard Nichol-
son settled in London in 1952. By
that time the movement for the
revival of “early’’ music and in-
struments had acquired much
of its present momentum.

The consort will play a pro-
gram of music from the ages
of Shakespeare and Milton.
Composers represented will be
Giovanne Coperario, Thomas
Lupo, Rochard Deering, William
Byrd, Mathew Locke, John
Ward, Orlando Gibbons and
others.

The program is the second in
a group of four music and dra-
ma presentations in recognition ;
of the Shakespeare 400th Anniv-

ersary at Davidson College.

The purpose of the survey, as
Stated by Harry McMullan, sec-
retary of the Yourig Republi-
cans. was not ‘to refute the ear-
lier, pole of the student body by
THE DAVIDSONIAN, but rather
to find out who would be willing
to work for Goldwater. Also,
the Young Republicans wished
to find out who is undecided in
his choice. of candidate, and
then perhaps convince him of
the merits of the: Republican
platform and candidate.

Of the students who would
support Barry Goldwater, al-
most half indicated a_ willing-
ness to work for his election.
Of the total number of stud-
ents polled, less than a third
are eligible to vote.

In accordance with the occas-
ion, the YRC passed a resolu-
tion stating in part, ‘It is the
belief of the Young Republicans
of Davidson College that the
death of the Honorable Herbert
Clark Hoover .has robbed this
nation of one of its most prin-
cipled Presidents and greatest
humanitarians.”’

The Republicans resolved that
the former President's ‘‘support
and defense of individual liber-
ty and concern for mankind is
known throughout the world.”

Edgar reminded the YRC that
anyone interested in helping at
the polls in Davidson on elec-
tion day should see Dr. J. G.

faculty, students and friends of the college in attend-

ance.

Some opponents of the old oath were satisfied with
the new vow, Dr. D. D. Rhodes said, “I think it is a
simple and much more straightforward type of vow. I
like the idea of having it administered during a special
ceremony before those people who want to attend. I
think the ceremony will be more meaningful than the
old ceremony at graduation.”

Others still disputed the measure. however. Dr. E.
F. Patterson said, “Any kind of a vow required of pro-
fessors at an institution of higher learning is inconsist-
ent with teaching at this level . . . I believe that this new
vow hurts worse than the old one simply because it in-

cludes more people.”

U.S. Misconception

“Someone has to say some-

the United States is really like.
America will be in ten years

cides it to be.”

Fred Ehlers. Richardson
Scholar from Ecuador, made
these statements in the organi-
zational meeting of “Project of
the Americas,” a young people’s
organization to create a new
American conscience.

The group met to form the
basis for its program this year
at Davidson. T. A. Rogerson is
the club's adviser.

This club will try to coordi-
nate with “The Voice of the
Youth,”’ a similar organization
in Ecuador. with the purpose
of creating for the first time an
intercultural exchange between
the young people of Ecuador
and the United States.

“NOT ONE DISSENT”
Martin expected the action to be approved for a
1964, meeting o

and therefore to see it made part of the By.
“When deciding on the proposal for chan
today, there was not one dissenting vote,”

But conclusions from a conference of about 12
faculty members with key trustees on the night before
the trustees’ May meeting influenced the Trustees to
send the issue back to its Education Committee.

President of the Trustees Richards said, “The fact
is that nobody was really satisfied with the new vow.”

The chief dissatisfaction was with the public cere-
mony clause. “The impression that I got,” Martin said,
“‘was that there would be much less objection to some
other kind of commitment. They didn’t think any type
of commissioning exercise is appropriate for teachers
who have been teaching here for a good while.”

Martin also told THE DAVIDSONIAN that the most
popular alternative was put forward by Rev. Albert Mc-
Clure, a trustee. He suggested that the dean of the
faculty and the president make sure of a man’s commit-
ment to ideals of the college before his hiring.

Such an idea is at the basis of the new proposal

began with a comment on the
Republican candidate, saying
that he (Golden) had always
predicted that “the first Jewish
president would be an Episco-
palian.”

He continued, ‘Barry Gold-

of Egypt. I.think he could. The
only trouble with that is, we

The speaker then settled down
to a more or less serious dis-
cussion of his topic, “What the

a short history of liberalism.
He pointed out that during the
New Deal of the Roosevelt era,
liberals and conservatives
switched sides.

Prior to Roosevelt, liberals
championed states’ rights, and

‘LIBERAL SEEKS STATUS QUO’

central government. At the
same time, the liberal, before
Roosevelt, was on the outside
looking in at the conservative
in power.

During the Roosevelt era,
however, the tables turned. as
the Hberals gained power. Now,
however, the liberal is in pow-
er, and “you never saw such
Status quo boys as we liberals,’
Golden admitted.

“The liberal wants nothing.”
he continued, “except to main-
tain the status quo." He point-
ed out, however, that the status
quo requires consistant updat-
ing. Some of today’s up-daters
are such things as federal aid to
education, medical insurarice,
and implementation of civil
rights legislation.

Golden then described the
main weapon the “far right"
has against the liberal: fear of
Communism. Yet, he stated.
the “far right” defeats its own
avowed purpose by opposing
liberal policies: ‘The liberal
stands between the Communist
and his target: the proprietor.”

Next, the amiable visitor ex-
plored his idea of the conserva-

'tive view of federal aid, espe-

cially im the South. He explained

‘that this conservative listens to

Goldwater expound on the evils
of federal aid. then goes down-
town to pick up his subsidy
creck, his unemployment com-
pensation, his social security
disability check, and so on. “In
fact."" continued Golden, ‘‘we
in the South have been kind of
a federal reserve for years!"
Golden continued, digressing
to talk about Sen. Strom Thur-
mond's “baptism’’ as a conser-
vative Goldwaterite. “You
know,"’ said Golden, “where
they sprinkled him with Gold-

water. There were thirty thous-
and. people there. There would
have been sixty, but the six-
lane highway built by the wicked
federal government ends two
miles from the airport. From
there you've got to go ona
state's rights road built in
1897!"

Finally, the assembly address
returned to what the liberal
wants, summarizing the posi-
tion: “The liberal wants to
expand the social legislation of
the Roosevelt era which saved
capitalism not only in Ameri-
ca, but throughout the Western
world.””

Golden then adjourned to the
Morrison room of the Union to
answer questions posed by a
large group of interested stud-
ents. He expressed his views
on a wide variety of topics,
ranging from Walter Jenkins to
the PTA. (In regard to the lat-
ter, Golden expressed his belief,
heartily seconded by those in at-
tendance, that it should ‘leave
the teacher the hell alone.”)

The amiable Semite overflow-
ed from a chair almost as tall
but not nearly as wide as he,
puffed on a huge cigar. and, in
short, was the Gentile picture
of a jovial Jew.

As his comments got lighter
and funnier, his accent grew
deeper, till he closed his stay
at Davidson with a voice reek-
ing of New York's lower east
side and said, “Every time the
Gentile gets unhappy, the Jew
catches hell. When he's out of
a Job, and his children are
sick, you can hear him mut-
ter, ‘Them Je-e-ews.’ So every
night, just remember that §ix
million Jews are praying for
your health and prosperity!"

of the heart and blood vessels.

There isn't a shadow of a doubt that physical well-being at all
ages depends to a great extent on regular activity or exercise. But
there's so little incentive to exercise now—what with push buttons
and sedentary pastimes—that flabbiness begins in early childhood,

Yet, more than half of our children do not get at least 15 minutes
of planned, vigorous, body-bullding activity during each school day!
Consequently, nearly one-third of them can't meet minimum stand-
ards for strength, agility and flexibility. .

The development of physical fitness—for all boys and all girls—
should begin early in Itfe.

What about the physical education program in your child’s
school? Is it planned mainly for students interested in varsity
sports? Or is it geared to the development of average boys and
girls—those most in need of physical conditioning?

The President's Council on Physical Fitness urges you to take as
much interest in this phase of your child's development as you do
in his academic development. Work with your school officials and
community groups to establish a program that emphasizes vigor-
ous activity daily. Bringing up youngsters with strong, agile bodies
is essential to their future—and the future of our country.

To help you evaluate the program in your school, the President's
Council on Physical Fitness will send you a free booklet. The ad-

dress is Washington 25, D.C.
