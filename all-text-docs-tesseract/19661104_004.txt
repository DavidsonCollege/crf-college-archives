POOLE GOES IN BACKWARDS
Third Quarter Touchdown Pushes Lead To 14-3

BENCH JOCKEY '

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor

THE PREDICTION PHILOSOPHY:

Everybody has to take a stab at putting himself on
a limb once in a while . . . so it might as well be now, after
the dust kicked up by Homecoming has had a chance to
resettle into its time-worn niches. _

The risks involved in the overt act of predicting pro
football games certainly need no explanation (except
perhaps why someone would do so on this side of ex-
communication from the Little Rascals Club). Well, J
assure you that Fred Kirby, the singing cowboy, and I
are on the best of terms, so that explanation can not be
the “fountain of truth.” .

Nor have | been in contact with Chicago’s powers-
that-be for their helpful insight. To put it bluntly, your
guess is as good as mine. ;

Now unless you ponder the situation thoroughly, you
may not realize how tough such a task is. You know from
the start you can’t make everybody happy. If everybody
were happy, there would not be much to mess with. And
you wouldn’t believe how many times a coin could stand
on end (would you believe six ties this weekend?)! Grant-
ed, there are several games this week that seem to call
for a foregone conclusion; but foregone or not, it is gone
“fore you know what hit you. oo

Predicting football games is in a way like pink ele-
phants — when you see what they look like, it is about
time to take a couple aspirin in hopes they'll go away.
And even if, for sheer jest, Fate smiles upon the ‘good
guys,” what does it suffice among the chorus of “So
what's’?

To wet your whistle in a hurry, first let us examine
Washington at Baltimore. Everybody knows that the Colts
can scalp the ’Skins any day — especially at home. But
didn’t everybody know that the ‘Skins would get romped
by. the Cardinals (who have only that loss to show against
six wins and a tie)?

Sure, Johnny Unitas can pass through the ’Skins
porous pot-bellies. But isn’t it about time for Sports Mlus-
trated to come out with Johnny U. on the cover after the
records he set last week?

The Colts are among the best and the roughest. but
the ’Skins have shown well against the big boys this year.
In a surprise move, the Redskins over the Colts.

After that bit of startling butchery, it is time to
settle down a bit. Dallas has too much for Philadelphia,
and their scoring punch got back on the beam last week
after 31 points in their last two. Besides, they beat the
Eagles, 25-7 in the last encounter between the two.

Cleveland should bounce the Steelers this week as
they did before by 41-10. The bombing that the Steelers
took in the second half of the Cowboy game last week
should have left them in shell-shock.

The Bears of the Midway face no real threat from
the Motownites when the Lions travel to Chicago. True.
Detroit won the first. time, 14-3, but that was the season

and Detroit does not. qualify to occupy rarified atmos-
phere. Gale Sayers is also starting to make himself known
again. So it looks like a win for Windville.

And to round out the “easv” picture, the Cardinals
should have no rea! trouble with the Giants, having ex-
perienced it once before. In their first encounter, the
Redbirds waited to squeak out a TD in the closing min-.
utes to win, 24-19. But thev were looking to the Dallas
game the following week. This time Pittsburgh is next.

Smith said Poole did ‘‘a great
job’’ of leading the team and
said the quarterback has done
a ‘‘great job’’ all year. He noted
that the TD pass in the fourth
was supposed to go to fullback
Billy Taylor, but when Poole
saw his principal receiver well-
covered he fired a quick pass to
Cox who was open.

John Giles added three extra
points to his PAT record. Cox,
Taylor, Pete Glidewell and Bill

and one of the top tossers in
the South.

This year Poole has set him.
self to the task of rewriting the

record books for both the Wild-.

cats and the Southern Confer-
ence.

After the first six games of
this season, the soft-spoken star
has a passing total of 105 for
172 tosses, good enough to break
the conference record for com-
pletions with three games _ to
play. His 1,361 yards total of-
fense and 1,127 yards passing
also lead the conference. Poole
put a new school record in the
books by connecting on his ninth
touchdown pass of the year Sat-
urday against The Citadel.

In his typical mild-mannered
way, the former North Mecklen-
burg quarterback reminisced on
what he considers to be his best
performance ‘Of the five games
that I started last year and the
first six this season.”’ he said,
‘TI feel that my best game pass-
ing was against East Carolina
when I threw 30 for 50. The Le-
high game was my best last
season.”

In that game Poole set a
record for total offense with 230

‘yards. “But overall.” he said.

“my best game combining run.
ning and passing was last week's
Citadel game.”

It was in that game that Poole
executed the play that he feels
was his most exciting. With the

" I've ever seen.”

Still Poole is reluctant to take
all the credit for his offensive
success. He was quick to com-

late in the last quarter, Coach
Homer Smith sent in a play from
the bench. It was supposed to
be a pitch to Billy Taylor who

‘would then throw downfield.

“The play ‘is a Taylor pass,
first and a run second.” Poole
said, ‘‘It had worked once be-
fore. I don't know why, but
when I saw Grég Cox open I
just decided to hit him.” The
play worked well enough to score
the winning touchdown.

Cox called him ‘‘the most ac.

ference. He is just great on

hit them. If they are not open.
I try to run.”

His ability to roll and throw to
either side is a large asset in

| his success.

Even though he sets records

Poole said that he was thrilled
to win the Homecoming game.
His two quarterback sneaks in

downs he has scored this year.

When asked what type of play
he likes to run the most, Poole
chose plays that give him sev-
eral options—plays where some-
one has to be open—as his fav-
orites.

Everyone assvciated with .the
Wildcat team is quick to praise
their quarterback: Trainer Tom
Couch has commented that he
feels ‘Poole could make a name
for himself in professional
ranks.

“T think our whole offense has
been tremendous. We really
haven't been stopped yet. We
have great confidence.” With
these words, Poole modestly
shared his great success with
his teammates.

The NFL finale is the Viking-Packer game. Norm

Wildkitten Coach Bob Brown was
optimistic in discussing his team’s
28-3 loss to N.C. State Friday. “Our
boys did a much better job on a
tough team than the score indi-
cates,” he said. “‘We stopped their of-
fense cold. Three of their scores
came after a fumble, a pass intercep-
tion and a missed defensive call.

“The offense moved the ball for
361 yards, but we are most unhappy
about not scoring when we got into
scoring range.”

N.C. State took Davidson’s open-
ing kickoff and drove to the Wild-
kittens’ 28. After an exchange of
fumbles, State sputtered in to score
on a drive capped by a Moody-to-
Whitley pass from the one. I. B.
Hicks’ PAT made it State, 7-0.

Davidson stalied at their own 43
after taking the ensuing kickoff. Ter-
ry Esterkamp boomed a 48-yard punt
to the State nine. Three consecutive
defensive gems by Cooper Brantley,
Al Hawkins, and Steve Butler forced

State. to punt. Quarterback Garth
Hampton ran and passed Davidson
to the State 37, but a fumble by full-
back John Zaharov ended the drive
at the close of the quarter.

Five plays later Esterkamp crash-
ed into the State backfield, batted
down a lateral and fell on it at the
State 45.

Hampton hit George Hannen with
a 28-yard aerial to the Wolflet 15,

but the drive stalled, and Ed Terry P

cut State’s lead to 7-3 with a.26-yard
field goal.

State took the kickoff and drove to
the Kitten 45. Two long passes took
State to the Davidson three, and Rob-
ert Hardin crashed over for the TD.
Hicks’ PAT put State out in front,
14-3. Each team threatened late in
the first half, but neither could
score.

Davidson took the second half
kickoff, but had to punt. Brantley,
Allen Hawkins and Dwight Hale

Hemric, L

Davidson the ball at midfield.

The fourth quarter was irustratin
for the ’Kittens. Even with Mike Kel-
ly and Hannen catching passes all
over the field, Davidson still couldn't
cap a drive with a score.

Brown singled out Brantley, Gary
nn Himes and Steve But-
ler for their fine defensive jobs.
“Our offensive had a rough time
icking up stunts while pass block-
ing, but they improved as the game
progressed,” said Brown. “This team
gets better and better as time goes
by. If their technique ever reaches
their desire, they will be unbeat-
able.”

Of Saturday night's game at Gard-
ner-Webb, Brown said “They are
ranked number six among the _na-
tion’s junior colleges and tied Fer-
rum, the team ranked first. They
have sophomores at every Starting
position and have played together as
a unit for one and a half seasons. We

made three key tackles to force a respect them, but we aren't awed by
