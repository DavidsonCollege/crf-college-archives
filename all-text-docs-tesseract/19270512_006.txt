Harrill’s Home Run Wins
for N. C. State College

A home run by Harrill in the eighth spell-
ed defeat for the Davidson ’Cats in the game
with. State College at Salisbury last week.
This sensational play broke a 3-3 tie that
begun in the third inning.

In the first inning Outen, of State, smash-
ed out a homer over right field fence, bring-
ing in Austin and McDowell. This placed
State three runs ahead.

Littlejohn, Davidson shortstop, hit a triple
in the second frame, and came in on an in-
field out by McGeachy. In the third, David-
son scored again when a double by Duling
brought in Davis and Ratchford.

Meadows pitched a good brand of ball for
Davidson, though he did not show up so
well in the eighth.

Allgood received good support, and, with
a show of real form occasionally, pitcher his
team to a win.

Littlejohn and Charlie Harrison shared

fielding honors for Davidson, while Mathe-
son starred for State.

Mattox Plays Baseball
With Columbus, Ga., Team

|
Star Catcher Joins Champion Foxes |
|
|

for Second Season

“Monk” Mattox, coach of Freshman foot-
ball, basketball and baseball, has left David- |

son for the rest of this year to play baseball |
with the Columbus Foxes, in the Southeast- |
edn League. This will be “Monk’s” second
year with the Georgia team, where he was
considered as one of its stellar players. Last
year he caught more than a hundred games,
and had a batting average of. over .300. In
short, he was considered one of the mainstays
on the team which won the championship of
the Southeastern league for the year.

Coach Monk’s rise in the realm of base-
ball has been swift yet well-deserved. While
at Washington and Lee he was considered
one of the shining lights of the team and
was acknowledged as one of the best catch-
ers that has ever been at W. & L. Soon
after he left college, Monk played on the
Greenwood, S. C., team in the South Caro-
lina League, and then after a short time on
the Anderson club.. Here he continued to
play an excellent brand of ball. He was
found and obtained by the Columbus team,
where he has remained. Coach Monk was a
strong factor in Columbus’ winning last year
and much is expected of him in regard to
their winning it again.

He will be back on the Hill to take up his
duties as coach of the Freshman teams by
September 1. The Freshman athletic sched-
ules for the past two years have been espe-
cially hard and although the records of the
team have not been very good, yet Coach
Monk has done invaluable work in training
men for work on the varsity.

man and W. W. Elliott, Duke, secretary ;

chairman, and C, C. Hatley, Duke, secretary ;
