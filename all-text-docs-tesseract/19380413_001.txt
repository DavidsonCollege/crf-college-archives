Hear Ye! Hear Ye! The. photo
| graphic contest has at last been
judged and here are the winners
Bob Parker won the regular con
test while Walter Kunz took top
honors in the song titles

Parker's picture of Iverson high
jumping and Kunz’s conception of
the “Dipsy Doodle” are the winning
pictures. W. FE. Cobb was runner-
up in both contests

Dr. Lyons, one of the judges, said
that the first twelve ranking pic-
tures were all very good, and that
he and Fred Smith, the other judge
had a hard time deciding the order
in which they should be placed. He
said that the many different kinds
of subjects in the pictures made
them extremely hard to judge

The College Pharmacy, The Day
idsonian, and the judges were very
pleased and very grateful for the
yreat response they received from
the student body and were = sur-
| prised at the amount of knowledge
| showed by the entrees
