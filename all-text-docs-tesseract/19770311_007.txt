The Davidsonian

Enough of the likes of Tony
Bennett, John Denver, The Letter-
men, Mother’s Finest, Kiss, and the
Mike Greene Jazz Band. Real music is
returning to Mecklenburg County.

Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker,
and Steve Young will be in concert on
March 13 at the Charlotte Coliseum.

Willie and Jerry Jeff hail from
Texas and, until recently have per-
formed in relative obscurity. As one
writer puts it, they’d ‘“‘been waiting in
the wings for years...to assume their
proper places in the structure’ of
American music when it became
apparent to them that their proper
places were perhaps being unduly
delayed because of certain resent-
ments harbored against them because
of their real and imagined unconven-
tionality.’’ They were unconvention-
al, but after taking matters into their
own hands, they won acceptance in
Nashville and are currently winning
rapid nationwide acceptance.

Concert sounds new

By DIOGENES THE DOG

Happy the Man’s performance in
Love Auditorium February 12 treated
Davidson to a kind of music heard all
too seldom: ‘‘progressive’’ rock,
which usually emphasized musical
value above virtuosity and self-indul-
gence.

Happy the Man consists of eight
sound, lighting, and business special-
ists plus five classically trained
musicians. Stanley Whitaker plays
guitar; Kit Watkins keyboards, flute,
and recorders; Frank Wyatt key-
boards and reeds; Rick Kennell
basses; and Mike Beck an astonishing
array of percussion devices in a
nine-by-nine foot cage. Whitaker and
Wyatt also sing occasionally.

All hail from Virginia, and all held
full-time jobs, practicing at night,
until less than a year ago. At that
time, British producer Ken Scott
(who has produced the Beatles, David
“Bowie, and Supertramp, among oth-
ers) was impressed enough by a demo
tape he heard in the Arista Records
offices to bring Happy the Man to
California to produce their first
album, due for release this month.

The concert in Love set a variety of
moods aided by both music and
lighting. The show opened slowly and
hypnotically, roving from that point
to the bouncy and whimsical and
many moods in between. |

The musicians, were all excellent,
but two deserve special note. Stanley
Whitaker had some dazzling moments
on guitar, but generally knew when to
-hold back for the good of the music.

HAPPY THE MAN progressively rocks on.

Jerry Jeff’s image is that of an old
drunk shuffling through life on the
pittance he pulls in from one night
stands. He sings some flippant songs
—“Up Against the Wall Redneck”
and ‘Sangria Wine” for instance—
makes the listener feel good inside.

Their brand of music lies some-

but other lyrics, as in ‘‘Desperadoes
Waiting for a Train’ and ‘‘That Old

Beat Up Guitar’, reflect a depth and

sensitivity not found in many popular
singers.

Willie has been around for quite a
while, singing for years to small
audiences in honky-tonks across the
country. He comes across as a relaxed
redneck without a care in the world.
Most of his songs, such as ‘‘If You’ve
Got the Money Honey I’ve Got the
Time’ and ‘‘I Gotta Get Drunk’’ are
light, but they inspire belly laughs
that draw the listener into the singer’s
seemingly halcyon world. Although
his lyrics generally lack the depth
found with Jerry Jeff, his songs have
a satisfying quality about them that

The amazing thing about Mike Beck
was not that he played such a variety

of percussive devices, but that he
played them so tastefully. The
percussion was probably the most
standing individual contribution to
the evocative quality and uniqueness
of the concert.

This is not to say that the show was
perfect. There was a great reluctance
to experiment tonally, perhaps be-
cause record companies are not
‘amenable to new avant-garde rock
bands. More rhythmic variety would
also have been welcome and the
synthesizer all too often produced the
overly familiar Chick Corea blat.

The most serious weakness was
that the band apparently has not yet
learned to end a song properly. Every
piece seemed to just stop with no
sense of finality.

There was also the occasional
tendency, widespread among ‘‘prog-
ressive” groups, to succumb to the
temptation to substitute cheap flashy
licks for tight melodic and rhythmic
structure, but Happy the Man
avoided this tendency much more
than do tackier and more successful
‘progressive’ bands such as Emer-
son, Lake and Palmer.

These weaknesses did not ruin the
concert; they only succeeded in
making a potentially great show
merely good. With time to develop
greater musical maturity and freedom
to follow their own aesthetics without
fear of contract cancellation. the
members of Happy the Man could
make a significant contribution to the
development of rock music.

where between “hard country”’ artists
like Merle Haggard and Ernest Tubb
and the “‘tinny’’ performers like Glen
Campbell and John Denver. For lack
of a better term, call it ‘progressive
country”’.

Their subject matter isn’t divorce
and alcoholism and life’s miseries and
neither is it Rocky Mountain highs

and the dirty sidewalks of Broadway.
They’ sing about the good things in
life: love, drinking, and nostalgic
reminiscences. After listening to their
songs (which are always characterized
by an underlying sense of satisfaction
with their station in life), one becomes
buoyant and refreshed. It’s almost
escapism.

Have a roaring time

By PATRICK COVINGTON

There were several film comedies
made in the late fifties and early
sixties which portrayed the United
States getting its comeuppance from
tiny nations; perhaps reflecting the
resentment from some quarters of the
pompousness of the nation which had
pushed the world into the Nuclear
Age and was now engaged in Cold
War bickering with the Soviet Union.
Peter Ustinov’s Romanoff and Juliet
(1961) was one of these films; Richard
Lester’s The Mouse on the Moon
(1963) was another. The latter was a
sequel to the 1959 film The Mouse
That Roared, perhaps the most
famous of these movies, and this

week’s Pop Films presentation.

The Mouse That Roared is based on
Leonard Wilberly’s novel of the same
name and is concerned with the
Grand Duchy of Fenwick, the world’s
smallest nation. Anxious for funds for
improvements in the country, the
Grand Duchy hits on a novel idea:
taking note of the fact that nations
defeated in war by the United States
always get elaborate reconstruction
funds, they declare war on the U:S..,
invading New York with twenty
archers in chain mail. Only one thing
goes wrong: they win the war.

The Mouse That Roared is sche-

duled for Friday night at 8 pm in
Hodson Hall and 10:30 pm in Love.
