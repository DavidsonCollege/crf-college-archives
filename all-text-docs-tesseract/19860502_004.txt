1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Staley lecturer discusses Dante , Protestant faith

By ANDREA GROSS

Dr. Stuart C. Henry, this
year’s Staley Visiting Professor of
Religion, spoke Monday and
Tuesday nights in the 900 Room
as part of “The Staley Distin-
guished Christian Scholar Lecture
Program.” The theme of the two
lectures was “Protestants Before
and After the Reformation: Ac-
centing the Positive in Protest.”
Monday’s talk, “Dante and the
Principle” dismissed the Christian
insights which can be found in
Dante. The talk on Tuesday “Rad-
icals and the Recognition,” de-
tailed the distinctive aspects of the

protestant faith.

Overall, Dr. Henry chose
Dante as a subject for study be-
cause his epic illustrates the Pro-
testant principle of “self-examina-
tion that issues in creativity and
growth.” Dr. Henry feels, in ac-
cordance with Tillich, that “Pro-
testantism may die out, but the
Protestant Principle never will.”

His discussion of Dante,
which moved chronicologically
through the epic, was on “an
anagogical level.” Dr. Henry re-
flected that Protestants “see who
we are in reference to God” and
that the people in Dante's hell

“have denied everything that is
possibly human. They are what
they love.” Dante’s purgatory
demonstrates “the  self-giving,
creative character of love,” Henry
also explained. When Dante's
hero reaches heaven, Henry said,
he recognizes the need to surren-
der to God, learns the principle of
self-examination, and returns to
earth to see the diety in others.
On Tuesday night, Dr. Henry
outlined the three tenets of Protes-
tant faith: “the authority of the
word in matters of faith and prac-
tice,” “the priesthood of believ-
ers,” and “saluation by grace.”

“Discussing the authority of the
word, Henry quoted Calvin, “we
must do our own believing as we
must do our own dying.” He
explained that the priesthood of
believers is “‘a whole new concept
of the meaning of the church — it
is a living thing.”

While addressing salvation by
grace, Dr. Henry praised Faulkner
particularly for his work Requiem
for a Nun. This work illustrates,
Henry said, that it is not the
“American aesthetic hero” who
needs grace, “a perfectly free
gift,” but “the person who can

longer help himself.”

Dr. Henry incorporated many
humorous anecdotes from his life
and from literature into his
speeches. “People who tell me
that God didn’t answer their
prayers really mean that he didn't
take their advice,” he said. Stan-
ley addressed an audience of be-
tween thirty and forty people both
evenings.

Dr. Henry is a graduate of
Davidson who earned his Ph.D.
from Duke Divinity School. He is
an ordained minister as well as a
published author.

Specialist speaks on the effects of television on children

By AARON LEVINE

Wednesday Dr. Eli Rubens-
tein, a specialist on the effect of
television on children, gave two
talks: ‘Television and the Young
Viewer” and “The Media, Social
Science and Social Policy for
Children.”

The first talk dealt with a fed-
eral study published in 1972 by
the Surgeon General's Scientific
Advisory Committee on TV and
Social Behavior, of which
Rubenstein was co-ordinator of a
national program of research on
television and social behavior for
the National Institute for Mental
Health (NIMH). The findings of
the NIMH group were sum-
marized in the Surgeon General's
report.

When the study was commis-
sioned in 1964, the question posed
was whether television has an ad-
verse affect on children’s mental
health. Since the matter was posed
as a problem of mental health, it
was deemed worthy of the Sur-
geon General's attention. When
the study was finally published in
1972, it was determined that there
“was a causal relationship  be-
tween television violence and
later aggressive behavior in the
child.”

The concrete results of the
study were: |) there was not much
change in the way television in-
dustry handles the situations of
violence that occur, and 2) a “*con-
tent analysis” of television prog-

ramming was instituted for a few
years after 1972 in which it was
found that the level of TV vio-
lence remained at a high level with
the exception of 1975. (The
American Medical Association
influenced that year’s results by
terming television an environ-
mental hazard.

These results caused many
new people and groups to become
interested in the effects of televis-
ion violence on television.
With the 1982 follow-up report
the emphasis shifted from the ef-
fects of TV violence to the other
effects television has on children.
Twenty-five researchers were
asked to write a chapter sum-
marizing the research in their par-
ticular field of television/social
behavior expertise. They deter-
mined that the networks do not do
a good job in their programing of
emphasizing the right values for
youths. The networks responded
with Saturday morning cartoons
which show the “good guys” win-
ning in the end and called this
value-oriented programming. Yet
as Rubenstein stated, “For the
very young... the connection
between action and consequences
is not made.”

It was also found that televis-
ion stereotyped certain groups,
and does not give the imagination
full play (like radio does) because
the images are already provided.
Television gives a warped view of
the world. Advertisements

socialize children to become con-
sumers. It was also found that
television presents an unrealistic
view of conflict resolution; how-
ever, this problem has been les-
sened with shows like Hill Street
Blues, which ends episodes with
an air of irresolution.

Finally, Rubenstein stated that
‘what we have to do is educate the
public to be more sophisticated in
what they see on television and

what they like on it . . . parents
should recognize that television is
not an innocuous babysitter.”
Rubenstein pointed out there is no
need for government regulation,
although the government should
keep tabs on the networks.

The second talk dealt with the
effect of the media on the dissimu-
lation of information on social sci-
ence research. This research is
often (hopelessly) intertwined
with politics. For example, in
1970 the Senate rejected the scien-
tific findings of the National Com-
mittee on Obscenity and Pornog-
raphy. The committee had failed
to show any anti-social effect
from exposure to pornography.
When the 1966 Kulman Report on
school desegregation came out,
the Johnson Administration used
it to maintain achievement has lit-
tle to do with actual equality. The
Nixon Administration used it to
argue for aid cuts in education,
and New York Democrat Daniel
Moynihan used it for proof that
American education should be re-

formed. The way in which these
findings were stated in the media
had an effect on the way they were
politically used.

If one looks deeper into the
problem, Rubenstein maintained,
one would see that scientists have
the view that journalists, when it
comes to science, are ignorant, in-
accurate and more interested in a
good story than good science. For
a better relationship between
media and social scientist, these
communication problems have to
be overcome, Rubenstein said.

From 1979 to 1982 at UNC
Chapel Hill worked to bridge the
gap with workshops between sci-
entists and journalists. The scien-
tist would make a presentation,
the journalist would write a story
on it, and both would then discuss
the results. The journalists often

complained the scientists did not (
understand their operational prob-
lems. With a deadline, a journalist
might not be able to get all the
needed facts. Rubenstein ended
by saying, “I hope media, social
science, and research on children
could form a meeting point.”

Receiving his doctorate in
psychology from the Catholic
University of America, Rubens-
tein is presently Adjunct Research
Professor of Mass Communica-
tions at UNC Chapel Hill.
Rubenstein is co-author of The
Media, Social Science and Social
Policy for Children and wrote a
chapter for Children and _ the
Faces of Television: Teaching,
Violence, Selling, co-edited by
Dr. Ed Palmer, chairman
Davidson’s psychology depart-
ment.

Minority students attend Admissions program

By NELLF MCCORKLE

Minority high school students
nominated by their guidance
counselors attended “Davidson:
College and Career Perspectives
at a Highly Selective Liberal Arts
College,” a one day program
sponsored by the Admissions Of-
fice Saturday. Eighteen high
school sophomores and juniors
participated; parents and guidance
counselors also came. The stu-
dents, all in the top 20 percent of
their classes, live within one and a
half hours of Davidson.

Asked the reason for a sepa-
rate minority admissions pro-

gram, Assistant Director of Ad-
missions Gary Mason said, “It’s
not really separate. In admissions,
you target groups with similar in-
terests — football players, foreign
students. When you identify po-
tential pools of applicants and
group them, you try to address the
questions of that particular group.
Now the thing about Davidson is,
it's been around a hundred and
fifty years, so there are lots of
alumni around. But they're not
necessarily in minority com-
munities, so we have to put the
signposts up.

“Even in the face of some con-

fusing publicity about the Klan
march held in Davidson Saturday
the night before, the program was
still well-attended and was a suc-
cess,” Mason said. Approxi-
mately 60 students, parents, and
counselors registered; 28 came.
“We invited less than 100 students
so that’s a really good response
rate,” according to Mason.

Mason said the Admissions
Office plans to conduct a similar
meeting next year. “We're build-
ing a new type of programming,”
he said. “We've never done this
type of programming before it's

brand new. We weren't trying to
recruit students, we were trying to
nurture students and their parents.
We were trying to be visible and
be perceived as a place that is wel-
coming.”

Acting Dean of Financial Aid
Kathleen Stevenson said of the
program, “It was a counseling
function as well as a recruitment
function.”

Activities included a speech
by Dr. Kuykendall; a discussion
of the value of liberal arts by Pro-
fessors Ault, Bliss, Foley, and

Putnam; a campus tour; speeches
by Mason, Stevenson, and Assis-
tant Dean of Students Paula
Moore Miller on application, fi-
nancial aid, and Davidson oppor-
tunities, respectively; and a Vail
Commons luncheon. Small group
meetings permitted students to
discuss specific disciplines with
Professors Albinder, Barton,
Case, Holland, King, Ligo, Man-
ning, Nutt, Clark, Ross, and
Stott, and freshman Melissa
Giverns. Sophomores Emanuel
Burch and Mike Makonnen and
junior Jackie Daughtry addressed
the group on student life.
