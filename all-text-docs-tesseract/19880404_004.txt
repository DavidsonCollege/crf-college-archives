Union Board answers

selection criticisms in forum

_ By TRIPP HELMS

The Union Policy Committee held a fo-
rum Tuesday night toinform students about
the process used to select Union Board
committee chairpersons.

Union Board President Sara Whitesides
and vice presidents Trina Janiec and Frank
Whitaker appointed committee heads late
last term.

Several students had protested, in letters
to The Davidsonian and elsewhere, when
the officers of the Union Board recruited
chairpersons who did not sign up to be con-
sidered for the positions. :

Whitesides explained to the students who

came to the forum that there is no specific
policy outlined in the the Union by-laws
concerning the selection process.

The only mention of general chairperson
selection in the by-laws states that “each
vice president shall appoint along with the
Union president the chairpeople of the
Program committees....”

To alleviate the misunderstanding that
students must sign up to be considéfed for
a Union Board position, Whitesides said the
board plans to add the phrase “the officers
of the Union Board reserve the right to
extend the applicant pool” to next year’s
sign-up sheets.
