Community Developing
Unique Housing Tract

By JAMES LEE
Staff Writer

In a program developed over the last two years,
the town of Davidson is making it possible for local
low-income families to find adequate housing at a sub-
Stantially reduced cost.

Davidson’s Community Relations Committee be-
lieves it has found the solution to what has been con-
sidered a pressing problem in recent years by develop-
ing a unique housing tract, according to H. Burling
Narramore, President of Bridgeport Fabrics, Inc. of
Davidson, and chairman of this committee.

Narramore said that various schemes were con-
sidered early in 1966 in hope of finding a truly work-
able solution to the problem of urban growth in an
area whose real estate prices are surprisingly high,
but whose residents’ incomes are usually low.

The committee decided to develop a nonprofit cor-
poration which would purchase and develop land with-
in the town as a subdivision. It was decided lots would
be sold at the cost of the land plus its development.

The Farmers Home Administration agreed to sup-
ply long range loans to all buyers who could meet a
few simple qualifications.

In February, 1966 Davidson Community Develop-
ment, Inc. was established. Thirty-three acres of land
on the western edge of town was purchased from Duke
Power Company.

Actual construction of the tract began earlier this
year, and has not yet been completed. The develop-
ment will have full sewage, water and electrical facili-
ties, and later, fully paved streets.

There are plans for 73 lots, each about half an
acre. Twenty-one have already been bought and con-
struction on several houses has begtin. The lots cost
around $1000 each.

The owners who qualify for the Farmers Home
Administration loans will be able to borrow enough to
cover the cost of the land and home; they will repay
at an interest rate of 5 per cent for a period of up to
33 years.

Narramore pointed out that buyers would have to
buy with the intention of building their own homes.
This is to prevent property speculators from buying
lots and then raising their prices.

Also, builders will have to construct homes of at
least $8,000 in value. This minimum was set in order
to maintain the appearance and value of the area in
general.

He said those who could afford to build in the de-
velopment would in. most cases leave the better dwell-
ings of the community available for the still poorer
residents whose present homes are barely adequate.
Therefore he feels the entire community will benfit
by the project.

Student Spends Summer
Organizing Community

By PAUL ROWLAND
Statt Weiter

While most Davidson students are openly impa-
tient to abandon the campus for the summer months,
junior Joel Keys stayed behind last summer to work
with VISTA in the community.

Although working in several areas, Keys concen-
trated on community organization. He characterized
his job as going into an inactive community, socially
and politically, and “trying to get people to think for
themselves.”

Explaining how he did this, Keys said that the first
step was finding out what people think is wrong.

This step was not difficult, he commented, but in-
spiring the people “to do something about their gripes
was another situation.”

Davidson residents decided that a clean-up pro-
gram was needed to alleviate health problems being
caused by mosquitoes.

After clearing their own property, the group of
citizens presented to Davidson Mayor F. L. Jackson a
petition requesting that owners of vacant lots be re-
quired to clear them, in order to prevent the further
breeding of mosquitoes.

Keys emphasized that he did not lead the clean-up
campaign, but rather tried to encourage citizens to
consider their problems and the possibility that they
could solve them for themselves.

The residents wrote the petition, distributed it,
and presented it themselves, Keys said.

Keys also worked at developing a tutoring manual
for STEP, the YMCA-sponsored student tutorial pro-
gram. which assists elementary school children, and in
distributing college scholarship information.

He was assigned to VISTA’s Youth Educational
Services in Durham.

YES offered to pay Keys to head STEP in David-
son, but he declined the proposition.

Since early summer, the
town of Davidson has been
clearing fields, spraying for
mosquitoes and carting off
trash, but Mayor F. L. Jack-
son maintains that no clean-
up ‘‘campaign” -is underway.

“It's not a campaign in
the usual sense of that word.”
Jackson told THE DAVID-
SONIAN. “It's just a routine
part of the town of David-
son's work.

“We want to build a resi-
dential town,” he said. ‘and
that involves keeping our
streets and premises clean.

We're just getting to work on.

a few problems we have
wanted to solve for some
time."

The major problem which
the town is trying to correct
is that of fields densely over:
grown with underbrush which
serve as breeding grounds
for snakes, mosquitoes and
rats.

In a letter mailed to Da-
vidson's property-holders this
summer, Jackson requested
that each citizen be respon-
sible for cleaning up his own
premises.

Jackson offered the town's
assistance in clean-up activ
itles to any property-holders
who had difficulty in getting
the work done, but warned
that the town would feel free,
to clean up the premises of
any uncooperating residents
and send them a statement
for the cost.

Jackson noted that a group
of Davidson citizens from the
Negro community was also
aware of the health hazards
posed by the overgrown
fields. This group presented
a petition to Jackson request-
ing that something be done
about the situation.

By the time the petition
was submitted, Jackson said.

University Aids Tenants
During Housing Shortage

By DON HOYT
Staff Writer

Duke and Columbia Univer
sities typify the varying atti-
tudes educational institutions
take toward the town around
them.

Duke responded to riots in
Durham this summer by
offering 326 units of housing
to relieve the shortage, in
sharp contrast to Columbia.
which is evicting tenants in
order to make room for a

$200 million expansion.
According to The Report-
er magazine, Columbia has

evicted about 3,500 New York

residents since 1940, and the
institutions which surround
it. including Union Seminary
and Riverside Church, have
evicted a like number.
Duke, however, reacted to
local problems with a three-
part program, which involves
selling 224 units of married
student housing, withdrawing

options on 102 other units and
turning the options over to
the Durham Housing Author
ity, and selling 25 acres of
property for recreational use.

rent work, but it did add
steam to it.”

The land-clearing equip
ment is still at work in the
community. Mayor Jackson
said that there was no ex-
pected finishing date. noting
that keeping a town clean is
a continuing process.

“We're trying to cooperate
with the citizens in this clean-
up program.” Jackson said.

“The group from the Negro
community told me that rats
were developing into a prob.

lem over there. We immedi
ately secured materials to
get rid of the rats and re-.
minded the group that rats
can't live where they can't
get food from open garbage
pails or scattered rubbish.”

Jackson emphasized again
that the city’s clean up ef.
forts should not be termed a
“campaign.” ,

“We wanted to get started
on this last year.’ he ex-
plained, ‘‘and even sent out
letters to five residents warn-
ing them to clear off their
property, But we didn't have
sufficient funds. so we start-
ed again this year. We set
aside funds in our 1967-1968
budget especially for this
‘clean-up work.’

Jackson stressed the point
that no discrimination had
been exercised with regard
to which citizens would be re-
quired to clean their prop-
erty. ‘We treat each of our
citizens alike."’ he said.

A federal agency. VISTA.
worked with the Negro com-
munity in preparing the pe-
tition to the Mayor.

Mike Norris. the VISTA rep-
resentative currently working
in the community, made this
statement to THE DAVID-
SONIAN:

“The mosquitoes are still
a problem. The feeling of the
community people seems to
be that not enough spraying
was done. What has _ been
done is good as far as clean
ing up is concerned, but more
definitely needs to be done.
Not all the property that
needs to be cleaned up has
been cleared.’'

According to Jackson, the
bulk of the heavy work so
far has been for the A.M.E.
Zion Methodist Church, and
is not yet completed. Jack-
son also said the town plans
to clean up some brush along
Mock Circle Hill.

Tutorial Program: A Big STEP
In Local Children’s Education

Over 80 Davidson students have joined STEP this
year, an increase of 25 over last year.
STEP, or Student Tutorial Education Project, is

together composing 60 per cent of the group. There
are 16 freshman tutors and 14 seniors.
Group leaders include Jim Bailey, Rick Harrell,

BREEDING-GROUNDS CLEARED

Clearing out overgrown areas is supposed to reduce insect population.

designed to help local elementary school students who
come from culturally barren environment, and there-
fore lag academically.

“I’m very pleased with the increased response
from students this year,”” said Bobby King, head of the
program.

“Judging from the enthusiasm shown at the initial
meeting Monday night and the tutor training sessions,
STEP’s work should have a definite impact on the com-
munity.”.

Because the essential problem of those being tu:
tored is their environmental background, tutors must
try to improve the tutee’s self-image by providing him
with success experiences, according to Robert Pyeatt,
a STEP tutor.

The basic problem is not less intellect, he said,
but less opportunity, for on non-verbal 1.Q. tests the
meres do as well as those who do better on verbal 1.Q.
ests.

The main weakness seems to be in reading, and in
this area the tutors help. But just as essential seems
to be getting to know the tutee as a person and a
friend, winning his confidence as a step toward ma-
turity, Pyeatt said.

Of the tutees, about a fourth are white and the
rest Negro. Twenty-two attend school in Cornelius, the
rest in Davidson.

The program involves field trips for the tutees,
who are under the direction of Bob McKellar, and en-
joys assistance in community work under the direc-
tion of Mike Norris and Bobby Lane.

Of the tutors, 26 are sophomores and 25 juniors,

Vernon Odum, Mike Payne and Pyeatt.

STEP was founded about a year and a half ago
by Norris, Jordie Lang and Marvin Sparrow. It has
grown to become one of the largest campus organiza-
ions.

Tutor training sessions this week dealt with prob-
lems the tutor may encounter and methods for solving
them. STEP groups will meet about once a month to
discuss their tutees’ strengths and weaknesses and
their own successes.

For the first time, STEP has an extensive library
of tutoring aids and materials. Most of the materials
deal with improving reading and verbal skills and cre-
ative tutoring techniques. .

Creativity is emphasized in tutoring. Since most
of the tutees are on a second grade reading level, this
is one of the main areas of concentration. Comic
books, hot rod magazines, or newspaper sports pages
may stimulate the tutee’s interest.

Such techniques as taking a field trip and writing

about it give the tutee creative expression.
_ __STEP, although an independent local organization,
is affiliated with Youth Educational Services, a North
Carolina group that operates tutoring programs
throughout the state. YES supplies pamphlets and re-
source materials.

Joel Keys, who worked in Davidson for YES this
summer, compiled a basic tutoring manual designed
especially for the disadvantaged Davidson community.

At contains detailed instructions for tutors,on be-
coming the tutee’s friend, providing him with success
experiences, and thus improving his self image.
