Eating house lottery

moves ‘smoothly’

By CAROL LOPTSON
Staff Writer

“Mechanically things went
very well with self-selection,”
said Dean of Student Will
Terry.

Last week 303 freshmen
sought places in the ten eating
houses on Patterson Court. A
new lottery type procedure
sorted students into houses of
their choice.

“IT think it went much more
smoothly and quietly,’’ said
President of the Patterson
Court Council Katherine Brid-
ges. ‘‘I ‘think more people got
where they wanted to eat than
last year. I also believe the
houses got people who were
really interested in their parti-
cular house,”’ she added.

However, there were some
problems. ‘One of the problems
was that sheets were not shuf-
fled as well as they should have
been,"’ said Terry. As a result,
only six out of 26 freshmen from
first Richardson and only six
girls from first Cannon got into
an eating house.

Barry Krieble, who lives on
first Richardson explained that
his hall counselors turned in
their forms before any other hall
had. ‘‘The first people on our

hall to be selected were the
people who turned their sheets
in last. First Watts, who turned
their forms in last all got their
first choices.”

However, ‘‘all but a few have
gotten into houses since then,”’
added Krieble.

Of the six girls from first
Cannon who got into a house
only two had handed their
forms into the hall counselors
and these two were the first on
the stack of forms from first
Cannon. “There’s been a lot of
complaints on the hall because
all of our forms were in one blob
on the bottom,”’ said Esther
Bruce, from first Cannon.

“Obviously something went
wrong with the system. Unfor-
tunately, we were the scape-
goats. None of the eating
houses have really contacted us,
except Rusk House, which has
been very enthusiastic. There's
nothing we can do about it
except wait and try to reform
the system for next year's
class,’’ said Debbie Carlton,
also from first Cannon.

Bridges said, ‘It’s just coin-
cental. I don't think it’s any
great concern because they’!]

Dorm committees to form

RHC begins aiding lounges

by KIRBY OWEN
Staff Writer

The Residence Hall Council
(RHC), under the direction of
SGA Vice President Bruce
Brown, has begun initiating
steps to improve the dorm
lounges.

These improvements will be
guided by a dorm committee set
up for each dorm. The commit-
tee will consist of: the House
Manager of the dorm, the
Resident Hall Council represen-
tative, and the Senate dorm
representative.

This committee would make
specific suggestions for each

individual lounge.
according to Director of Stu-
dent Housing Scotty Nicholls,
each lounge could have different
things in it that would make it
different from the rest. But she
pointed out, ‘‘It’s the extra
things that make a room special
that are the things that are
missing.”’

All of the dorm lounges were
done over in 1970 by an interior
designer. Since then, basic
things have been done for the
upkeep of the lounges before
each school year.

The RHC hopes that more
detailed improvements can be

made. These include providing
more reading lamps, improving
the walls with wallpaper or
paintings and prints, providing
immovable ashtrays to protect
the carpet, adding furniture:
couches, chairs, and study
desks.

Nicholls pointed out that
paintings have been hung in the
lounges before and, at one time,
student paintings were being
used. ‘‘There is no problem with
buying anything that will make
the lounges more attractive and
livable,'’she said. |.

Brown said the major concern

Trustees increase comprehensive fee

The Davidson student’s compre-
hensive fee will exceed $5000 for the
first time next school year. This 8
percent increase in the current fee was
announced at the Trustees’ meeting
last weekend and will be matched by a
10 percent increase in money available
for financial aid.

College Comptroller Robert W. Da-
vidson attributed the increase to an
anticipated ‘‘jump”’ in Duke Power
utility rates added to the general
inflation already affecting the present
budget.

Business Manager Robert A. Currie
added that major increases in food
costs per student at ARA food services
contributed significantly to the hike in
the overall comprehensive fee.

Another reason cited by Currie was
the increase in the minimum wage this
year and the expected rise of the
minimum wage next year. Those
increases especially affect the wages of
a large number of employees with the
food services.

“We tried to hold the line (on price
hikes) everywhere, '’ said Davidson. A
full explanation. for the increase in
comprehensive fees will be mailed to
the parents of students soon.

Tha funding for the proposed college

mark. The construction of the com-
mons is scheduled to begin next fall
with the opening date set for Septem-
ber, 1980.

The Finance Committee approved
the Administration's proposal to match
the $500,000 gift for the commons in
the fall with a $500,000 loan from the
College Endowment Fund.

This $1 million will be enough to
begin the construction of the Com-
mons. The Gray land gift in Raleigh
will eventually be sold to pay back the
loan from the Endowment Fund.

The Finance Committee is still
studying investment management of
endowment funds and reviewed the
data of a number of firms in case the
committee chooses to change the
endowment fund management.

The Trustee Committee on Develop-
ment announced at the meeting last
weekend, that a professional consulting
firm, Barnes and: Roche of Philadel-
phia, was selected to help analyze the
strengths and weaknesses of the Da-
vidson's development program.

“They are a highly regarded firm,”
stated the Vice President of Develop-
ment Duane D. Dittman. The firm will
concentrate on reviewing Davidson's
1987 Program, in which the College
hopes to raise $35 million for endow-
ment, operating funds and new build-
ing projects. ,

The firm, which charges $600 a day,
will have recommendations for the
school in, April.

Sre~ Bevelopment Committac >=

reported that committments toward
the 1987 program have reached
$5,419,114 in fund drives over the past
year and a half.

The total gift income for the fiscal
year 1978, which ended January 31,
was $2,613,565. This is a 300 percent
increase over 1977. Not included in the
1987 figure are the deferred gifts of
Henry B. Abrahams ($61,375), and the
Gray real estate gift.

The Development Comittee re-
ported on other fund raising projects
including the Living Endowment Li-
mited Campaign, which raised
$209,000, the 1977 Wildcat Fund with
a record amount of $152,650, the
Corporate Support Program with
$153,390 and the foundation grants
with $582,648 (including $500,000 from
the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation for
general endowment).

$35,000 was committed for the
$70,000 first phase goal of WDAV-FM
and $500,000 raised of the $800,000
goal for the renovation of |Martin
Science Building.

The Education Committee inter-
viewed three faculty members at this
meeting who will be up for tenure this
spring. Vice President of Academic
Affairs T.C. Price Zimmermann could
not release the names of the candidates
because of administrative policy.

"The Board of Trustees will make
tenure decisions during its spring
meeting.

The current procedure for tenure
ewaluation is fer che tenure cainéraac

and department chairman to each
submit the names of five students, and
five graduates who have been taught
by the candidate to Zimmermann.
Zimmermann then interviews three

students and five graduates from each
group and two tenured faculty mem-
bers. The President's recommendation
and material on each candidate will
help the Board with its final decision.

According to Zimmermann, he. and
College President Samuel R. Spencer,
will be working on a code of Faculty
Evaluation Procedure during spring
break. A new proposal may be ready
soon after the beginning of spring
term, Zimmermann said.

Two new amendments of the College
Constitution and Trustee By-Laws
were approved by the Board of Trus-
tees.

Paragraph three oi Article LX on the
Council for Campus and Religious Live
(CCRL) was amended to included the
presidents of the Patterson Court

Council and College Union on the
CCRL.

Article one of section IV on manda-
tory retirement age, was deleted so
that trustees may now serve’ on: the
Board after their seventieth birthday.

Four new trustees were installed on
the Board: Edwin F. Lucas, Jr., a
Davidson alumnus J. Kicson Phillips
and Mrs. Britt M. Armfield, from
Orange Presbytery; and Dr. Angus
McBryde, the President-elect of the
“Alumni Assoei@vion.
