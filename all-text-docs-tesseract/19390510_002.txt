But, the students, the majority of
them, disagree with this new plan, even to
the extent of violerice. We-believe most of
the student body will agree, that the fac-
ulty has the interests of the college and stu-

dents at heart. They want to make David-

or

son a better and more desirable place and
are sincere in their efforts. Certainly, if the
has
abused to an extent of lowering the scho-

present system is being, and been,
lastic standards something should be done
to remedy it. Therefore the faculty is justi-
fied in trying to do something about the

matter.

But, as it has been said, the plan offered
by the faculty does not appeal tothe stu-

dents. It has antagonized them. Exactly
what it should not do. The two groups,

then, disagree, and we are sure that a plan
could be put in that would satisfy both fac-
ulty and students.

It is not impossible to work out a sys-
tem that will be satisfactory to both parties.
It seems that the easiest way would be to
find out the different reasons that the stu-
dents for cutting These
“causes” could be studied and remedied sep-
arately and a new system drawn up from
this. Here are a few of the reasons listed:
Students cut classes because,

have classes.

’

1. They are unprepared for a class.

2. They go on week-end trips for “social

reasons.”
3. They sleep through classes.

4, Athletic trips, YMCA Deputations, de-
bates, etc.

5. Uninteresting classes.

6. They rave a series of six or seven
straight periods and get “restless,” so they
do it for rest.

7. To study for a later class or review.

These are only a few of ‘the many rea-
sons, But each of the above reasons could
| be remedied easily with a little effort from
both parties concerned and probably the
present system that has been abused so
much, would again work smoothly. For in-
Stance, the first cause—Unpreparation.
Either for good or bad reasons there is and
always will be students that go to class un-
prepared. Some, instead of going, and facing

the possibility of getting a bad mark, will
cut. A well-known school in the north has
remedied this easily. Students who are un-
prepared, report to their Professor at the
beginning of the class. The professor allows
the student to sit in class but asks him no
questions, The student gets the benefit of
the which not have
gotten if he had cut. The Professor gets the

recitation, he would
benefit of having most of his class on hand.
Now, three of these “unprepared” excuses
would count as a cut. It is possible. That
certainly would eHminate a great number of

the abuses that come from the) first cause.

Remedies for the others could be worked

out as easily.

But in remeding the situation there are a
few things both the faculty and students
should remember:

1. That any system presented would he

abused to a certain extent. It’s human

nature.
2. That both parties should have a say in

the of both
parties should be heavily weighed.

matter, Opinions concerned

3. Antagonizing the factilty or the stu-
dents will get nothing accomplished. What
is needed is a better understanding between
the two groups.

4. Students should have a larger repre-
sentation in the matter. After all, it is they
that are the most interested parties and it
is they that have to suffer the consequences.

5. The opinion of the faculty should be
taken into consideration by the students.
After all, they're trying to help us mould
our lives and. their efforts are not bene-
ficial to any one but us.

6. Above all, whatever plan is adopted,
whether it favor the faculty or students,
take it like gentlemen and bear it.

Yours, for a Better Davidson.

Parade of Opinion

Peace

Far from cloistered have been U. S. halls
of learning during the period of world-wide
unrest that has made the citizens of all na-
wander far

tions from the placidness of

Ferdinand the Bull. Collegians and their
teachers are taking an active interest in the
state of the world, and are becoming more
belligerent when it

comes. to defending

democracy,

Chief blow to the passive pacifism that
in other years brought an endorsement of
the famed Oxford Oath (“TI won’t fight un-
der any circumstances”) was the abandon-
ment of the oath by the delegates to the
conventions of the American Student Un-
ion and the National Student Federation of
America. Both meetings urged continued

peace education, but both more or less ap-

proved the President’s rearmament_ pol-
icies.
Presidential messages on rearmament

’

brought a chorus of “yeas” from the col-
legiate press, with only here and there a
scattered “nay.” At the University of Vir-
ginia, “College Topics” stated the case for

the supporters of the move like this:

“Pacifism and optimism insofar as world
peace is concerned are admirable under
normal conditions, but Utopianlike and
thoroughly dangerous while world affairs
are in their present turbulent state. We are
people who espouse and champion democ-
racy—democracy faces unpredictable trou-
ble. We are people who espouse and cham-
pion disarmament—at the present time,
such action on our part with the known
status of other powers on the subject, would
be suicidal. Therefore, we must exercise
Sagacity in the administration of our gov-
ernment of the human race. We must pre-
pare for the direct emergency in defense of

our standards and our country.”

On the other side of the fence stand those
who cheered Joseph Day, who calls himself
“one of the future cannon fodder,” when he
sent a letter to the Southwestern University
“Megaphone” which said: :

“Perhaps, Mr. President, you |don’t have.

the foresight and intelligence to see that in
all probability you are signing the death
warrant of possibly a’ hundred thousand ‘or
of a million choice men.”

1-MINUTE SAFETY TALKS

I burn when I see somebody driving
a car down our street faster than he
should.

Yet, I'd burn if I were doing the
same thing and a cop caught me and
gave mea ticket.

But I oughtn't to.

I ought to remember that my little
Hildegarde crosses that street several
times a day and plays on the other
side, and that traffic regulation and
enforcement are for her protection.

I ought for her sake, to be so loyal
to tratlic regulations that I would feel
goo! about getting a ticket.

There is always injustice in any
ticker WE get for a traffic violation.
Let's just have sense enough or sense
of humor enough to remember that
our own ticket is invariably going to
seem unjust....and let's have sports-

in the name of a good cause.

At the present rate, according to
estimates made by e Travelers
Insurance Company, one out of every
three children faces the PROBABIL-
ITY of death or maiming from motor
accidents in the course of a lifetime.

So what we need is more tickets,
not fewer tickets. And no “FIX-
ING",

I like the spirit of that wife of a
New York magistrate who some time
ago appeared in traffic court and paid
a fine.

I think some types of patriotism
and public spirit are apt to be the
bunk, but I believe we should all lean
over backwards to take what's com-

ing to us for traffic rule violations.

“LUCKY NIGHT.”—Myrna Loy
and Robert Taylor.

One of the bright new pictures
of the season, and it has just been
released to the public. The two
leading players, Myrna Loy and
Robert Taylor, should speak well
enough of it for everyone to see
it, but their acting isn’t the only
high spot_of the picture.’ The plot
deals with, as you might be able
to guess, their love affair, but their
acting and humorous scrapes make
this well worth seeing.

“THREE SMART GIRLS
GROW UP.”—Deanna Durbin, Nan
Grey, Helen Parrish, Charles Win-
ninger, Robert Cummings.

Here is the cinema that most of
us have been looking forward to
ever since “Three Smart Girls” was
current. With nary a black mark
against her three-year screen rec-
ord, Deanna Durbin has brought
home another winner. Practically
the only Hollywood star never to
have experienced thé*pangs of fail-
ure, Miss Durbin grows more
charming, more assured and love-
ly with each picture, and her voice
matures right along.

These three girls have all grown
up since the last picture of their
escapades, and Nan Grey and Helen
Parrish are in the throes of love.
Meanwhile Penny, Deanna in dis-
guise, is busy fixing things up for
them. The situations that arise be-
cause of her well-meaning bungling
are hilarious, and the relationship
of the three sisters is pictured with
natural charm. After switching fi-
ances on her sisters a few times,
driving her parents to the point of
hysteria and working ‘herself up
into every mood that a 16-year-old
girl could possibly live through, the
heroine comes through with suc-
cess.

Deanna sings beautifully, “The
Last Rose of Summer” being a par-
ticularly memorable moment. Rob-

ert Cummings plays well as one of

the lovers of the sisters, and Ernest
Cossart helps in the cast by help-
ing Penny straighten out the fam-
ily problems.

“UNION PACIFIC.”—Joel Mc-
Crea, Barbara Stanwyck, Bob Pres-
ton, and Lynne Overman.

The second railroad picture in a
row, but this one deals with the
establishment of~the railroad out
through the west. The men were
faced with hunger, rades of Indian
tribes, and political enemies, but
their dauntless courage led them to
complete the task that they had
begun. Joel McCrea and Barbara
Stanwyck turn in masterful per-
formances, but the most pleasant
surprise of the picture is the act-
ing of newcomer Bob Preston. He
is slated to have the qualities of
Gable, Taylor, Power, and Flynn

WHAT EVERY RISING SOPH-
OMORE SHOULD KNOW: Fresh-
men are like electricity—unhar-
nessed they are of no particular
value, but when adapted to your
use they become almost beneficial.
They are most easily made into
laundry boys, house cleaners, er-
rand runners, and suckers to buy
anything under the sun.

Speaking the last-named
adaption, several general rates have
been in effect for a decade or more
and it is best to follow them next
year. Here are the standards—
Cost of getting radiator turned on
—25c, discarded copies of O Da-
vidson (which must be known per-
fectly in 6 hours)—15-35e depend-
ing on the freshman, fee to get a
chapel seat reserved—l5c, fee for
an agency for any company—the
sky's the limit, and the value of
“swiped” freshman caps—25c.

are not the dumbest
creatures in the world, however; as
an illustration we point with pride
to the member of the present sen-
ior, class, who, after being at Da-
vidson for two months in 1935 and
having run up an enormous spend-
ing account, explained it to his fam-
ily that, “Freshman had to carry
money at all times to be ready to
lend to upper classmen and no one
dared ask for their money back.”
This should be a starter if you did
not already know them; from here
on you're on your own and remem-
ber that fun is the reward of in-
genuity.

To Mr. Hobart, superintendent of
grounds and buildings, for his work
in making a Better Davidson, His
work in keeping up the campus
throughout the year goes’ unnoticed
by most of the Student Body, until
someone, usually a visitor, remarks
how lovely the campus looks. Have
looked between the
dormitories at unsightly hedges, or
untrimmed bushes? Have you ever
seen the front campus littered up
with paper and trash that you
threw down the day before? Have
you

you ever

ever been ashamed of your
campus’ appearance before friends?
The answers to these questions is
simple . NO ! ! And so, Mr.
Hobart, I should like to voice the
applause of the entire student body
in writing, to you. Your efforts to
make our home for the four years
that we are here a more livable
place have certainly succeeded, and
in the phraseology of Walter Win-
chell, a white orchid to you and
your helpers. To you goes the cred-
it for making the Davidson campus
one of the most beautiful in the
South,

Davidson Firsts

The first X-ray photograph éver
to be made and constructed by a
college was done here at David-
son about 43 years ago. Yale Uni-
versity claimed the credit for a
number of ‘years, but later gave
way to the claims of three Physics
students, who very unostentatious-
ly went about by cover of night
and stolen supplies to accomplish
this deed, Three students of the
class of '96, Osmond Barringer,
Eben Hardie, and Pender Porter
stole the materials from the Phys-
ics lab one afternoon and_ that
night made an X-ray of a dead
person’s hand. But they were so
afraid to tell of how they had pos-
sessed the -equipment, that they
kept it a secret for quite a while

. the fraternity court plan here
was the first of its kind and since

have followed the example ... Da-
vidsoil\ was the first college to have
a woman supervisor of dormitories
and also first to place all student —
publications under a Publications
Board . . . Let's hope it’s not the
first to give up the Dean’s list.
“Wuthering Heights”

A film classic that translates the
masterpiece of Emily Bronte in a
way that has all Hollywood talk-
ing. Sam Goldwyn has imported
1,000 heather plants and the song
of British larks to take this pic-
ture; landscaped 540 acres of Cali-
fornia into a Yorkshire moor, and
a dialect expert to see that the
words matched the heather and
the Linton manor. Laurence Olivier
as Heathcliff portrays the “dead-
end” boy who is adopted, refined,
only to find himself a servant, a
stable boy at that, who is violently
in love with Merle Oberon. This
cinema deserves 4 stars in anyone’s
column ... yes, you, Murphy ! !

New York Fair

One structure that has escaped
the notice of most describers of the
World's .Fair in New York is the
Hall of Music. It demonstrates’ a
new form in theatre construction,
using flowing lines of functional
construction throughout. Two and
a half thousand ‘spectators daily
fill its auditorium to hear and see
many of the great musical presen-
tations of our times. :

This lad has probably caused
more spats and furors among the
Davidson gentlemen and their gals
than any one person since the days
of the great Kang. He dotes and
thrives» on luscious morsels that
may be small at first, but with his
build-up, they appear to show all
actions lascivious and wanton. He
is undoubtedly the Walter Win-
chell, the key hole watcher, and
the Peeping Tom, of the campus.
He was bred in Harlan. County,
Kentucky, which may account for
it.
