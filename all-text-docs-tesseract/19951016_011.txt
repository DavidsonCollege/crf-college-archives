Its Magic

The Chinese Magic Review
dazzles viewers

' By JoRDAN DEBREE

For those of you who missed
the Chinese Magic Review on
October 3, I can only offer my
sincere condolences. §

You probably missed the
greatest show ever to set foot on
Davidson campus.

This band of quasi-circus per-
formers thrilled and entertained the
Davidson crowd for nearly two
hours.

Their act was aclever mixture
of showmanship and disciplined
skill, driving the audience to near
hysterical excitement.

But, of course, you cannot
comprehend the mood of astonish-
ment which sweptacross the room,

if you were not actually there.

On behalf of all those who
have been made believers, I am a
witness to what happened in Love
Auditorium on Wednesday, Octo-
ber 3.

One amazing act after another
hit the stage in full force, leaving
us asking, “How the hell did they
do that?”

One performer pulled about
15,000 playing cards from thin air,
shooting them 30 feet into the air in
broad symmetrical arcs.

Another wielded a 300 pound
battle ax, twisting it around his
body, flinging it across the room
with the type of ease we would
associate only with a pencil.

There were human contortion-
ists, wrapping themselves intotiny

pretzel shapes, balanced delicately
on chairs stacked high to the sky.

And do not let us forget the 20
foot unicycle which maneuvered
his way between 10 wine bottles
placed only 12 inches apart.

It did not stop there, though.
Do we dare swallow several three
foot swords at once, as one particu-
lar performer did?

Can we explain how one ma-
gician made humans and station-
ary objects disappear with the twist
of a hand or the wave of a magic
wand?

Altogether, it was an amazing
night. It is my hope that this is not
the last time the Chinese Magic
Review visits Davidson College.

They’re even more entertain-
ing than the circus.

or in dealing with depression them-
selves, Professor of psychology
Dr. Cole Barton opened the panel
in an unorthodox fashion: he
played blues tunes to illustrate what
he had to say.

“People who are depressed are
generally more accurate perceiv-
ers of reality,’ said Barton, and

used the music of Lightnin’
Hopkins, Robert Johnson, B.B.
King, and Billie Holiday to make
statements for him. He empha-
sized that depression can simply
be a pervasive low feeling rather
than the extremes that many people
think of when they hear “depres-
sion.”

He also stressed some general
facts about the illness: it tends 'to
run in families; there is a gradient
over which all levels of depression

occur, and while the numbers may
be skewed because women. are
more apt to share their feelings,
women seem to “get depressed”
more often that men.

The four panelists had many .

things to say about depression, with
two distinctly different views. Two
of the panelists were on the out-
side, dealing with the illness in
family members, and the other two
experienced depression them-
selves. The two panelists that
talked about depression and fam-
ily dealt with depression in their
fathers. One of the panelists de-
scribed her father’s depression as a
“downward spiral.” He had be-
come depressed after she left for
Davidson, making it easier for her
father to hide the condition from
her. She expressed frustration with
herself for not knowing, not just
with the illness itself. But she took
extra care to emphasize that her
father through a mixture of therapy
and medication was doing well;
that there was a “light at the end of
the tunnel.”

Another of the panelists who
had experienced depression her-
self described a sentiment that is
common among those who are
depressed. In trying to help, giv-
ing advice is probably not the best
idea. Listening to someone who
you think may be depressed will
likely be more helpful to someone
feeling the effects of depression.
One of the panelists said that ad-
vice from a friend went unnoticed,
because “I just listened to her. I
really didn’t want a solution, I just

_ solutions.”

wanted someone to listen to me.
All you can do is be supportive.”

So what were students to take
away from the panel? One of the
adult panelists put it best when she
said, ““Know that you do not have "
to go through those feelings with-
out recognizing that there are easier
This same panelist sug-
gested that the step for overcom-
ing depression for her included a
combination of medication,
therapy, prayer, and conversation.
In fact, for all the panelists and in
all the literature distributed by the
school, conversation seems to be
key in the healing process. The
people affected by the depression
heal by talking about it; those who
would help. the healing process
need to be good listeners — and
willing to intervene on behalf of
the person they are trying to help.
Depression, as one pamphlet sug-
gested, “is an illness, not a weak-
ness.” Not being ashamed to tell
someone is the first step to helping
yourself move on.

Thursday also gave students
the opportunity to pick up litera-
ture about depression, as well as
evaluate themselves for the illness.
The self-examination offered ques-
tions on the typical warning signs
of depression, questions involving
level of general energy, outlook,

and life outlook. The panel discus-

sion was attended by experts to
help interpret the results of the test.
The panel was concluded by a
showing of Ordinary People, afilm
about depression directed by Rob-
ert Redford.
