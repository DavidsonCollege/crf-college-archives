Convocation Provides

Purposeful Fellowship

To the Editor:

As I am sure everyone is
aware, this Friday marks the
date for Fall Convocation here
at Davidson. As usual, stu-
dents are counting the days
until they can take off early
for the weekend or sleep for
a few extra hours.

This is the way it has been
for my past two years at
Davidson, and I am sure it will
be the same for many this

year.

This lack of interest is really
a disgrace to Davidson
College. Many hard hours of
work go into the production of
Fall Convocation, and it is a
shame for students at a school
with no compulsory chapel to

miss an opportunity such as.

this. Convocation offers one of
the few chances for the entire
student body, faculty and staff
of Davidson to gather
together. —

I don’t‘mind admitting that
Fall Convocation has been one

of the most moving and
meaningful ceremonies that I
have attended at Davidson.

An indescribable feeling of
pride swells up inside me
when I see the senior class
assembled as a body in cap
and gown; and as I see the
faculty move in majestic
academic procession down the
aisle, I feel glad to be a mem-
ber of this organization.

Certainly it is ritualistic and
traditional, but it is a pleasure
to see my classmates honored
for their achievements, and to
see a faculty member
recognized for his or her con-
tributions to the teaching
profession.

To many of the students of
Davidson, Fall Convocation
will come and go this year as it
has in the past. Please make
this year different by taking
out a short hour of your time to
attend convocation.

: ‘Ozark Mountain Daredevils:

Earthy, Rocky, Harmonious

By LEE HUDSPETH
Staff Writer

The Ozark Mountain
Daredevils, a new group of
musicians, originated in the

Colorado-Kansas area. Their.

first album, ‘‘The Ozark
Mountain Daredevils’’ was
produced in 1973 and made
popular by the radio
promotion of two songs, “If
You Wanna Get to Heaven”

‘ and “Chicken Train.”

These two songs are much
less intense than the remain-

‘der of the album due to the

slightly humorous nature of
their lyrics.

The former is the only
“rock”? song on the entire
record, and the latter consists
of a twanging mouthbow,
much repetitious harmonica,
a bit of percussion, some oc-
casional chicken squawks,

and very mysterious lyrics.

The other eight songs are
down-to-earth, full, and
meaningful both from a
lyrical and a musical point of
view. Each song is arranged
so that the vocal harmonies,
interplay of instruments, and
words complement each
other.

One of the finer songs on this
record is ‘Within Without”
composed by Larry Lee. The
lyrics deal with the metaphor
of a man’s body being his
house.

Thus he views the world
from two angles--from within
his body and from without.
The song expresses
displeasure with life and the
futility multitudinous people
experience because they fail
to know themselves.

The song begins with even,
single-stroked chords on an
acoustical guitar with a low
bass in the background. Then
enters a mandolin, the note-
line of which serves as an in-
troduction and compliment of
the melody to come. The
melody itself. is even and
flowing. The vocals. are sung

by a single resonant voice with
powerfully sincere inflection.
Between verses a superbly
smooth and light run is heard
on the lead guitar, then as the
words cease the instruments
join in a magnificent con-

clusion.

The lead guitar re-enters
intensely, highlighting the
determined searching mood of
the entire arrangement, and
each instrument adds to the
creation of a climax after
which they all slowly fade out.

“The Ozark Mountain
Daredevils” is indeed a qual-
ity recording of the unique
music of a group of close-knit
and creative instrumentalists -
and vocalists.

Each cut retains its own
message and means of com-
municating such; however,
with a group as relatively
inexperienced as the
Daredevils, one must realize °
that the- music. tends to
become repetitive in places,
thus obscuring its purpose.

Nevertheless, the quality of
that which remains is
unquestionable.

| ‘Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia’

Sam Peckinpah’s ‘‘Bring Me the Head of
Alfredo Garcia” is a disaster. The screen-
play by Gordon Dawson and Peckinpah
from a story idea by Frank Kowalski and
Peckinpah seems merely a vehicle for the
director’s undigested fantasies and ob-

The main character and Peckinpah-
surrogate is a fast-driving, sharp-shooting,
tough-talking, hard-drinking, hard-loving
son of a bitch with a heart of gold. He plays
piano in a sleazy Mexican bar until, faced
with an opportunity to earn $10,000, he sets
out on what simply must be called an
odyssey to find and bring back the reeking
head of the late AlfredoGarcia.. _ _-

He takes along with him several bottles of
vodka, a picnic basket, his mistress, and his
pistol. The mistress, heroine to the film and
sexual fantasy for the director, is a big-
breasted earth-mother-type and multi-rape
victim.

The film is best when it is most sen-
sational; because then it is not boring, which
is what it usually is. Making sensational
scenes that are not boring requires talent,

and Peckinpah, like Ken Russell, has the.

gift. ;
Peckinpah seems to be excited by
thoughts of murder, rape and sadism, and
when he is filming scenes involving these
things, his excitement carries over into his
work. Violence sets fire to Peckinpah’s.

imagination, and his best choices of camera
positions and inspirations of editing usually
happen while working on these scenes.

In “Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Gar-
cia,” he crgates a veritable poetry of swer-
ving cars, Shooting guns, and falling bodies.
Whenever a car swerves, a gun shoots, or a
body falls, this is when the film has one of its
climaxes, which would be fine if the film
were an abstract contemplation of the
beauty of the sights and sounds of violence.

Unfortunately, it pretends not to be.
Peckinpah .also concerns himself with
character study, plot development, and

-thematic density. I have already given by

implication my opinion of his charac-
terizations. The plot is more a progression
of episodes than a development.

In his hero and heroine, Peckinpah seems
to be trying to present his vision of ideal
man and woman. The plot shows what hap-
pens to them in a less than ideal society.

The film is so ineptly done in these’ re-
spects that it almost finds a degree of suc-
cess as an absurdist work or a deadpan
comedy. . :

However, interpreted in these ways, the
film becomes even more murky than it’
really is. ie

“Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia” is,
Tam afraid, a serious, sincere work.
