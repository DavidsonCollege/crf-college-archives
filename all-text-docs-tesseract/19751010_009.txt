Football Squad faces Bears,
tough offensive backfield

By PAUL BANTA

The Davidson College foot-
ball team, after losing to Guil-
ford last week, faces a power-
ful Lenoir Rhyne squad this
week.

Kick-off time is 2 p.m. on
Richardson Field.

The Bears broke from a
sluggish start and whipped
Newberry 31-6 last week to
raise their record to 2-1-1.

They defeated the Wildcats
handily last year, as their
offense rolled. They have av-
eraged close to 400 yards total
offense per game this season.

“They are a very explosive
football team that has some-
thing like nine of their eleven

defensive starters and eight of
eleven offensive starters
back,’’ said Davidson coach
Ed Farrell. ‘They will be an
extremely tough opponent for
us.” * '

Lenoir Rhyne’s offense is
led by two running backs,

Scott Crawford and Mike Mc-:

Whirter. Crawford, who was
an all-Carolinas Conference
selection last year when he
rushed for 1191 yards, has
already gained 454 yards in
four games.

Davidson’s : hope depends
upon the ability of the offense,
which showed some improve-
ment againse Guilford, to
control the ball against the
more experienced Bears.

“We've gotten to the point
that we can mount some
offense to get the first downs
to keep a drive going,’’ Farrell
optimistically commented.

“But we’ve got to find a way ©

to come up with the big play.
We've given up some big
plays, but we haven’t been
getting any ourselves.”

Davidson again will be go-
ing with five or six freshmen
starters, including either Bill
Wolar or Sid Osborne at
quarterback.

The defense is looking for-
ward to the return of senior
defensive back Mike Eubanks,
who missed the first two
games because of an injury.

The Wildcat football squad.

dropped its home opener 26-10
to Guilford last Saturday.

The Wildcats, 0-2, took the
lead in the first quarter on a
52-yard field goal by Joe
Duncan, which deflected off of
the left upright.

Larry Hardaway gave the
Wildcats a 10-7 halftime ad-
vantage by sweeping in from
the one-yard line. The scoring
play -was set-up by a 50-yard

pass from quarterback Sid
Osborne to Stan Brown.

The Wildcats continued to
shine on their initial third
quarter possession.

Davidson ve from its
own 39-yard line to the
Guilford eight before Osborne
was thrown for a 10-yard loss
on a fourth-and-goal play.

“For two thirds of the game
we felt we were vastly im-
proved,’”’ head coach Ed Far-
rell explained. ‘‘But the mo-
mentum completely went the
other way in the third and
fourth quarters.”

The momentum did change,
as Guilford took just three
plays to score, taking the lead
for good at 14-10.

The Davidson offense was
led by Hardaway, who gained
60 yards on 16 carries, and
Brown, who caught two pass-
es for 98 yards.

“I should add that our
players’ reaction following the
loss to Guilford was en-
couraging,”’ Farrell remarked.
“They are not discouraged and
they are willing to work to
make the improvements that
are necessary.”
