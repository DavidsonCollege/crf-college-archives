Debut...

With this issue The Davidsonian

makes its belated 1943 debut. It is not
the usual dashing journalistic sally into
a waiting collegiate world, we fear, but
rather a timorous venture into a dimin-

ished sphere with a clouded future.

Several interested, we hope, subserib-
ers have inquired as to the future of this
particular publication, and, having no
recourse to a crystal ball, we were forced
to admit that this question had vexed

cur Imaginations for’ some time now.

Our only answer is that we plan to
continue publication in the customary
form as long as it is practicable, and that
we this will be

hope that possible

throughout the spring. The necessity for
some sort of newspaper will not be re-
stricted, we expect, by anything that is
trom the available evidence likely to hap-

pen.

It is not our policy to apologize for
our work or to solicit compliments in
any form, but the editor feels that the
restricted staff that has consented to
tackle the doubled jobs connected with
compiling material for this paper, when

‘the hope of gaining recognition in the
form of editorship has been practically
eliminated in each

case, deserves his

thanks and those of the student body,

The problems of coverage will natur-
ally be more difficult and we would like
to solicit the continued cooperation of
students and faculty in the interests of
a-better Davidsenian “for-a-better- Da-
vidson”’,

Rumor Box...

Inspired by memories of sleepless aft-
ernoons Wasted in worried bull sessions
about the latest whisper of what was to
happen to who when, most of which
never did, last semester, we are inaugu/
rating a new device which we hope will
prove to be an active stimulus to student
morale.

This will take the form of a “rumor
box” which has been placed in the lobby
of Chambers. Any rumor which you en-
counter, with reference to campus life,
of course, which you would like to have
confirmed or denied, write out and drop
in the box. We will attempt to find its

source and to publish the true version of

the item,

We realize that we are sticking our
reportorial necks out in attempting such
a service and that in magy “of the cases
we Will be as much at a loss to discover
the truth as you.

However, we hope to make it a worth-
while venture and invitethe timid victims
of campus rumor mongers to drop their
Worst in the receptacle.

\nticipating the first ten contribu-
ions we would like to announce that re-
Hable sources seriously doubt the truth
of the rumor about the student store.
The possibilities of its becoming a post
exchange with bar, et-al,is to say the
least “dubious”.

Congratulations ...

Overcoming a long-standing and en-9
tirely natural prejudice toward the pub-
lication recognized as the “humor maga-
zine’, in a rather loose rendition of the
term, we teel bound to congratulate Edi-
tor Lyman on the flattering rank accord
ed him by the Harvard Lampoon,

Of course it must not be forgotten that
the Lampoon is also a humor magazine
and following the’ sometimes question-
able sense of humor that such literary
eltorts have been known to portray, per-
haps this is some sort of joke. However,
we should, we suppose, take the honor
aceorded Lyman and his assistants at its
‘ace value and concur in the opinion of
the experts,

\We would not infer that our plaudits
are bestowed in any begrudging fashion,
and we extend to the staff of Scripts 'N
Pranks our best wishes for continued
success and recognition, (Editor’s note:
Anyone furnishing proof of family re-
lationship between the Editor of Scripts
"N Pranks and the Editor of the Harvard
Lampoon will be awarded a free sub-
scription to the Davidsonian and the pos-
sibility of “public congratulations by the
YMCA Secretary”. ) Sime

Generosity...

Perhaps the most genuine and out-
standing quality of all great men and
true friends is generosity. Some give of
their wealth, some give of their time,
some give of their very selves. The im-
portant think is that they give unselfishly
of Avhat_ they have to something they
love.

Davidson has lost two great and true
friends. Captain James P. Grey, who
magnanimously proved his loyalty in life
with his many gifts to Davidson, of
Which the library is an outstanding ex-
amnleshas lett another menYorial to his

wn gencrosity.

The new year also brought the irre-
; arable loss of one of its most generous
givers ot the last commodity. In the
Ceath of Dr. Archibald Currie after 36
years of active duty with the college
faculty Davidson found itself missing
ore of its sincerest personalities and
moat respected characters.

Few people realize the unique nature
«ft Dr. Currie’s capabilities. One of his
courses, which has proven; one of the
most popular and valuable among David-
son graduates for years has no imitation
in any institution in the country. The
‘gxt was printed solely for his classes.
The -administration-has been unable to
‘ind anyone to continue two of his classes
‘ecau_e the essence of his teaching was,
not tobe found in any text but in himself.

Davidsien will not fail because of the
loss of any one or several men but the
c ntributions of such men have made ,
this fact possible>-The lives of such
Christians are missions completed.
