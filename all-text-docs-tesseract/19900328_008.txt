As Wildcat diamond fans
might remember, last season
the Davidson baseball team
journeyed to Florida fora series
of Spring Break games. It re-
turned 0 - 6 for the week and 4
- 11 overall. It was an early
deathknoll to a long season as
the Wildcats finished 12 - 27.

This season the Wildcats
fared muchbetter, as they went
4 - 3 for the week, including a
three-game sweep over Yale
and a stellar 3-2 victory over
then third-ranked Miami of
Florida. Miami came into the
contest 20-3, including a vic-
tory earlier in the week over
Davidson, but Hurricane bats

generated nothing but wind as :

Greg Wilcox recorded 12
—strikeouts-a:

four hits enroute torunning his

season record to 5-0.

This past week saw the ‘Cats
lift their record to 15-13-1. On
Monday, Davidson defeated a
young Hartford Hawk ballclub
22-1.

The Wildcats registered 6
home runs (commonly re-
ferred toasdingy-dongy-ding-
ies by the bleacher bums) in-
cluding two by centerfielder
Ron Krnacik. Derek Twombly
got the victory and raised his
season record to 2-3. Tuesday
the same Hartford team re-
turned to witness Greg
Wilcox’s record-breaking 27th
career victory. :

The Wildcats chalked up
another win on Friday when
they traveled to Catawba. The
tone for the 7-5 victory was set
in the top of the first when
Wildcat shortstop Rob Een-
hoorn led off a game with a
home run for the third time this
season. The ‘Cats never trailed
in the contest and Dave Wil-

the season against only two
defeats.

Saturday Duke traveled
down the interstate to try to
end the Wildcats’ five-game
winning streak. Unfortunately,
Davidson seemed all too will-

ing to help the Blue Devils in
their quest. The second. inning
spawned three Davidson er-
rors, leading to Duke’s first run
of the afternoon. Derek
Twombly pitched well the rest
of the way, holding Duke to
just seven hits, one of which
was asolo home run in fhe 4th.
Unfortunately, Davidson’s
bats were even less audible;
they were the victims of a three
hit, 2-0 defeat.

The ‘Cats began a new win
streak the following afternoon
when they defeated the Bruins
of Brown 17-2 behind the pitch-
ing of Greg Wilcox. Dingy-
dongy support was provided

by Peter Hughes (his fourth) .

and Mac Chapman (his sec-
ond).

‘Cats break records,
place, at track meet

By JAY CLUGSTON
The 1990 men’s and women’s
track and field teams have
begun their outdoor season,
competing in the Seahawk In-
vitational at UNC-Wilmington
March 10, the multi-team meet

-at the University of Miami (F1.)

March 16 and the Davidson-
Ridgeview Invitational March
24.

Sophomore Kathy Beach and
freshman Heather Tarpley
have had outstanding per-
formances for the women’s
team. Beach has continued the
“run through the record
books” she began during the
indoor season, and has set a
new school record at each out-
door meet. At UNC-Wilming-
ton, Beach ran an 18:51.4 5,000
meters. She. turned in a 4:53.3
1,500 meters at the University
of Miami, and last weekend at
the Davidson-Ridgeview Invi-
tational she shattered the out-
door 3,000 meter record by 15
seconds, running a smooth
10:23.88.

Her performances have not
surprised coach Gary Andrew,
who feels that Kathy has barely
begun to tap her potential.
Tarpley paced the women in
points scored at the Davidson-
Ridgeview Invitational, plac-
ing sixth in the discus with a
throw of 106’7", fourth in the
100 meter hurdles (16.40) and
second in the 400 meter hurdles
(1:10.06).

Other strong performances °

for the women havecome from
freshman Jennifer Brown, who
ran a 2:28.36 800 meters at
UNC-W, and senior Susan
Swift, who captured seventh
place in the shot put with an

’ effort of 31’8.75". A big thank

you is exter _..... ‘ix: women
who competed fo. the ‘eam at
the Davidson-Riczgeview
Invitatic~ >}. The men’s team
hasi..: .1ed by freshman jave-
lin thrower Paul I.evengood
and a solid group of distance
runners. Levengood threw the
javelin 155’3" to place fourth at
last weekend’s home invita-
tional.

Notable performances by the
distance crew included a 2:02.4
800 meters by Ber. Wiley, a
9:08.8 3,000 meters by Ian Ste-
wart and a sensational 4:06.2
1,500 meters by Peter Hurtado
at UNC-W. Strong races were
contributed by upperclassmen
David Murray (15:55.7 5,000
meters) and Ted Richardson
(4:12.9 1,500 meters).

At the Davidson-Ridgeview
Invitational, senior Jay Clug-
ston and freshman Peter Hur-
tado placed first and second in
the 1,500 meters for the Wild-
cats, with times of 4:08.24 and
4:09.62, respectively. Senior
Robbie “Sage” McKay cut
seven seconds off his previous
personal best time with a
4:21.88 1,500 meters.

The 5,000 meter corps, com-
prised of Richardson, Murray,
Chris Otrok and Stewart all
“got on the train”, sweeping
third through sixth places with
times of 15:53.03, 15:54.34,
15:59.24 and 16:02.85, respec-
tively, and Peter Hurtado
closed the meet witha flourish,
running a53.2 split for the infa-
mous “Slow Honky” quartetin

Men’s tennis turns away Ohio University

By ROBERT GRUBB

The men’s tennis may have enjoyed
its first spring break in more than 15
yearsa bit toomuch. The Wildcats came
back from break with a sluggish per-
formance against Harvard’s B-squad,
losing 5-2.

“It was easily the worst match so far
this season,” said CoachJeff Frank. “We
just weren’t match tough. With the
break, it had been almost two weeks
since we had played. The intensity and
competitiveness just weren’t there.”
According to Frank, the team had a
meeting after the match, in which the
players discussed the lack of intensity
and poor play of the team.

The ‘Cats must have said the right

things during the meeting. The team
came back to take a 5-4 decision over
Ohio University. Davidson had en-
countered the Bobcats at the Washing-
tonand Lee tournamentearlier this fall.
Ohio University won the tournament,
while the Wildcats finished third. The
‘Cats managed to win the head-to-head
encounter, however, despite losing
three three-set matches. Gary Wheeler
and Eli Gowan came up with the most
important victory in their match at third
doubles. They decided the match for the
Cats by winning a third set tiebreaker.

“The Ohio match was just a great
performance from top to bottom,” said
Frank. Albie Varosky won his match at
second singles after struggling in the

first set. John Beyer also wona three set
victory at fifth singles. Joey Manibo
won in straight sets, to capture his sec-
ond match in a row. The early season
emphasis on doubles play then paid off;
the “Cats clinched the victory by taking
two of the three doubles matches.

The match lasted nearly six hours,
and left the team drained for their
match against Colorado the next day.
The Cats lost the match to the Buffaloes
9-0. “I knew it would be tough to come
back and play against a team this good
less than 12 hours after the Ohio
match,” explained Frank.

The Wildcats’ record stood at 11-7
entering Tuesday’s encounter with
Wake Forest. They return to action Sat-

urday, visiting former Southern Con-
ference rival East Tennessee State and
travel to UNC-Greensboro April 3:
