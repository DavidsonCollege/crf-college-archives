LETTERS TO THE EDITOR | |
Durant Proposes ‘Clearer Picture;’

Thornton Refutes Patterson: Letters

To the Editor:

I think it’s time ‘your
readers — students, alumni,
and trustees — got a clearer
picture of the fraternity | sit-
uation at Davidson, one that
this paper has not put forth.

The trustees voted to abo-
lish fraternities, not change
them. Spencer says, ‘’We
are not abolishing fraterni-
tles.” Well, there is no way
for them to remain under
the conditions the trustees
set down.

These conditions, I must
add, were set down to some
degree, on some rather false
ideas the trustees were led
to believe. Many ‘trustees
came out of the meeting
thinking the fraternities
were $20,000 in debt. Yet in
fact, they are owed $20,000
from_past members.

Trustees aiso came out of:
the meeting thinking that
their vote, abolishing frater-
nities, was-what—most_of the
students wanted: ‘Again, not
so. :

These ideas were put in
their heads, in addition pro-
bably to a few more false
ones by Spencer, his left-
hand man, Peter Hobbie,
our infamous SGA, and our
excuse for a newspaper,
THE DAVIDSONIAN. '

Editor Shoaf speaks of the
‘finality’ in relation to the
‘Blue Sky Report’’ requiring
" area exams? -

Did THE DAVIDSONIAN,
the SGA, and the students,
particularly this year's. jun-
ior class, work ‘with the
trustees’ decision to ensure
the success of the new cur-
riculum? They did not and
neither will the students to-
day when they have done
wrong.

One final note to the
alumni regarding the cartoon
in ‘last week’s DAVIDSON-
1AN. According. to several
alumni around Charlotte,
Spencer is not worried about
the fact that this decision

may cut off the support of
many alumni.

He thinks «he can
enough himself and run
Davidson without alumni
support. This fact was given
to me by several alumni.

Alumni money is not the
only support you can with:
draw from Davidson Col-
lege. Now is the time for
every person, alumni, stu-
dents to speak up and undo
the evil that has been done.

To the Editor:

(Professor E, F. Patterson
is a frequent contributor to
the “Forum” letters to the
editorial columns of the
Charlotte Observer.

I trust it will not be unbe
coming in me to comment
on his latest one, published
Sunday the 8th, in which he
advocates the socializing of
America’s railroads. In
case you did not read his
article, I have a few copies
that I will supply on -re-
quest.

1 think his premises are:

wrong, and that of course
means that wrong conctlu-
sions must inevitably fol-
low.

(1) He cites As a model —

for the U. S. to follow the
hationalization (socializa-
tion) of the railroads in Eng-
land. But that country has in
a couple of decades gone
down hill so-fast that it is
perhaps at best a third rate
nation.

Its’ socialized medicine is-
a shambles and there is
credible evidence that many
of its doctors have — fled
rather ‘than practice under
politically appointed know-
nothing bureaucrats. It has
had one major devaluation
and is struggling to avoid
another. The premise that
England is a good example
for the United States, in
anything, —isobviously—_a
false one.

Court Reforms Suggested

To the Editor:

During the last four years
I have become increasingly
disenchanted with the honor
system ‘at Davidson College.
This disenchantment results
from what I consider to be
several major faults in the
nature and. operation of the
system. °

First, the system - which
we hold to be an honor sys-
tem of laws, The institution
of the court and the threat
of dismissal from — school
‘does not make men more
honorable.

Further, requiring fresh-
men to sign a pledge before
they have come to Davidson
is meaningless as an at-
tempt to mold a community
based on respect and honor.
The spirit of honor which
does: exist here is a product
not of the system but. of: the

(2) The premise that  so-
cialization (which is the
historical forerunner of com-
munization) of any public
service in the United States
is worthy, is not borne out
by the one clear example.

The United States Post Of-
fice Department. It is pub-
licly owned and managed.

It is, if we may believe half
what .we read, fouled up

integrity of the men who re-

side here and the type of
community which Davidson
is.

Second, the punishments
do not fit the crimes. Dis
missing a man from David-
son to ensure that he does
not spoil the honor of the
community totally — disre-
gards the effect upon that
man and violates the inte-
grity of the community.

Davidson should, rather
than suspending a man, ac-
cept the responsibility — of
‘constructively dealing with
one who deviates from the
values of the community.

Third, under the present
system a man is considered
guilty until proven innocent.
In a trial, the evidence is
presented by the investigat
ing committee and then the
defendent is asked to con

with inefficiency. and waste.
| think Dr. Patterson

should’ publicly prove, with
facts and figures, that so-
clalism. and/or communism
has created greater free-
dom and a better life, any-
where. in the world, than we
have in these our. United
States.

Polley Corrects Article

To the Editor:

I appreciate the article
THE DAVIDSONIAN ran on
my trip to the Middle East.
At first the caption (‘‘Polley
Makes Archeological Find’’)
disturbed me, for. the only
objects I uncovered were
potsherds, flints, a bronze
ingot, and a bronze nail.

[But the first sentence re
lieved my anxiety by dating
the bronze nail 3500 B.C.
This. would indeed be: a

~ “find,” for the Bronze Age
in Palestine is usually dated
from. ca, 3000 B.C. (at the

earliest) to ca. 1200, B.C.;
my discovery clearly calls
for a revision of Palestinian
chronology. od

But alas, fame is illusive
in this caSe it resides in the
slip of the writer's pen. The
bronze nail wds found ex-

’ actly where it should have

been, lodged in a thirteenth-
century stratum. There is
evidence, however, that Ge
zer was occupied as early
as 3500 B.C.

Fourth, fhe institution of
the court instills in those
elected to the court a feeling
that the court.is the bastion
of honor at Davidson.

I in no way mean to at-
tack the individual members
of the court since [ know
them well and do not consid-

er them to be evil men.
Nevertheless, the feeling. of
Defenders Of Honor does

exist and is perpetualled by
the system of a permanent
court,

The situation, however, is
not hopeless. I do feel that
the system can be revised
in order to allign it) with
the. goals—ef the whole com-
munity. :

‘Accordingly, I offer sever
al suggestions for change:

(1) Abolish the permanent
court and substitute instead
for each trial a jury, chosen
at random from the com-
munity of students, faculty
and administrators, —

(2) Institute advocacy pro-
cedure,

(3) Institute
judge
law),

a position of
(someone — skilled. in

(4) Change the mame. of
the system to reflect its na
ture.

(5) Mlow the jury (if the
defendent is found guilty) to
recommend a sentence
which will reflect the needs
of the man and of the com-
munity.

(6) Familiarize the fresh

men with what the com
munity holds to be the re-
sponsibilities of a member

of their living and legrning
community.

These suggestions are only
suggesiions. This is a mat-
der about which reasonable
men can and should dis-
agree. My primary hope is
that the community realize
that the system does need
to. be changed.
