Famous Jazz Trio
To Present Concert

On Tuesday, April 7 at

ditorium Rock 'n Roll will give way to the Jazz of the

Students Reserve
New Dorm Rooms

“Boys, choose your room-
mates-” said Mrs. Moore this
week. “You can’t get a room
for next .fall unless you have
one.”

The Bursar's Office sent out

8:15 p.m. in Chambers Au-

internationally famous Bernard Peiffer and his trio now ,a letter two weeks ago stating
on tour of the United Sates eastern seaboard to the/that an advance deposit of

south and midwest.

Affiliated with the Mutual
Concert Association, this trio of
Peiffer on the piano, Gus Ne-
meth with the bass, and Gerry
Segal at the drums will be spon-
sored by the Gamma Kappa
Chapter of the Phi Mu Alpha
Sinfonia Honorary Music Fra-
ternity of Davidson College.

Bernard Peiffer has
ceived numerous praises for
his musical talent. “‘Bill-
board” speaks of his techni-
que as showing “imagination
and displaying his classical
background without getting
too far away from a jazz ap-
proach. ” “Down Beat’ identi-
fies him as “an honest artist
of forcefuiness and impress-
ive musical knowledge.” In |
the words of Leonard Bern-
stein, Bernard Peiffer is “a
real virtuoso of jarz.”’

Since 19856 Peiffer has been

re-

entertaining Americans in the}
great jazz rooms of Chicago, |

|Colorado Meeting

Washington, Philadelphia, and
New York. In July of 1957 and
1958 he played at the Newport!
Jazz Festival several numbers

which Decca Records has re- nethy, Chairman of the Facul- hall counselors should apply}.

corded in a collection called
“The Astounding Bernard Peif-
fer.” This was followed by the
albums “Bernies Tunes” and

“Piano a la Mood.”
}

Peiffer played at the Charlie
Parker Memorial Concert in
Carnegie Hall and also held a
recital at the Philadelphia
Academy of Music at which he
played Ravel, Prokofieff, and
Peiffer originals during the
first half and changed to jaz
with his Birdland colleagues for
the remainder of the program.

‘Rock and roll,” according
to Peiffer “is nothing . .. |
it will soon fade out com-
pletely. More and more real
jazz is being played on radio
and television, gaining new
fans, and that is fine.”

(

Concerning America, Peiffer
admitted,
changed since I’ve been here.
I get a jazz feeling 1 could
never get in France . . . Jazz,
like pure Frénch wine, is from
the ground where it has gath-
ered the essence of its sur-
roundings for years and years.”

At his program here on April
7, Peiffer will entertain with
such numbers as “Lullaby of
Birdland,” “Autumn Leaves,”
“Soon,” “Yesterdays,” “Last
Night When We Were Young,”
“Black Moon,” and many other
familiar pieces of jazz and
classical nature.

Tickets for this performance
may be obtained at a reduced
student rate of $1.25 at the

D Club Produces
“Foolies" Minstrel

The “D Club Foolies” will be
held Friday night, April 24, in
Chambers Auditorium. This
year's performance will be a
Minstrel Show.

Ray Atkins is producer and

Tom Kernan is writing the’ s

script. “They should do a real
good job of it,” commented
Alex Porter, of the Foolies
Committee.

The parts will be decided
next week. “We're going to
have a lot of good acts. Ray
and Tom have a lot of good
ideas. This one should really
be a Jot better than last year’s,”
stated Porter.

Porter was reticent to com-
ment about the disapproval of
the faculty concerning the pro-
posed performance, “They were
worried about the ‘racial ten-
sion,” he explained. “It will be
poking fun at the school instead
of the colored people.”

So up

vidson to readers outside the
college community.

( feel thet 1 am qualified
for the editorship having
worked on newspaper staffs
for the past five years. My
work on the sports page has
been excellent preparation
since it deals with all phases
of newspaper work from the
mechanics of make-up, as-
signments, head writing, and
Proofreading, to editorials,
features, and the setting of
style.

Also, besides my work in
other sections of the DAVID-
SONIAN, I have written for
various newspapers in this area
and have done work for both
the Associated Press and Unit-
ed Press wire services.

The news story is the basic
element in any paper, and I
would keep the standard of
writing high by holding per-
iodic meetings with the report-
ers to discuss effective writing.
Along with clear, concise news

stories, I plan to use a pertinent .

selection of pictures on the
front and back pages.

The editorial page would
deal with focal issues and
any national or international
situations deemed relevent to
the student. The editorial

policy would attempt to be

ame ere Sen en eee epee |

constructive and progressive
and not merely = critical.
Among the various issues for
which | pian to campaign are
a modified cut system and an
improved curriculum.

Also, as much space as possi-
ble would be given to students
who desire to express their
opinions in letters to the edi-
tor.

DICK SMITH

The banner of the DAVID-

SONIAN calls it “The News and
Editorial Voice of Davidson
College.” It is up to the editor
of THE DAVIDSONIAN (1) to
be responsible for reporting
Davidson College news to the
student body, and (2) to formu-
late and express the paper’s
editorial policy. It is with these
aims in mind that I submit a
brief outline of the policy that
the 1959-60 DAVIDSONIAN
will follow if I am elected edi-
tor.
In the field of news, all col-
lege and campus events will
have a place in the publication,
including those of current stu-
dent interest and those still un-
announced to the student body.
They will be reported accurate-
ly and rapidly.

Sports coverage will con-
tinve to be interesting, and
there will be a good deal
more emphasis on intramur-
als. Those reporters who
write sports articles will re-
ceive the same instruction as
news writers, insuring the
same high quality of writing
for the sports page as for
the front and back pages.
