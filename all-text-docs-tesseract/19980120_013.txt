THE DAVIDSONIAN

*ve completed a semester. I now
I know whatto expect from this place.
I’ve had experiences that make me
more knowledgeable and wise — well,

at least according to a sign at the end of
my hallway on First East Belk. Written
in smudged, black, dry erase marker it
proclaimed to all last Saturday when I
arrived back on campus, “Welcome

back ... You’ re all seasoned veterans.”

Yeah, that’s right, I thought: sea-
soned veterans. Pride coursed through
my body.

I am a Davidson student. I’ve
made it through one term. Classes can
no longer intimidate me. J can do
anything.

I wish those last statements were
true.

I wish that I could convince my-
self, talk myself into believing them.

Unfortunately, I can’t.

Unfortunately? Really? Is that so
unfortunate?

Toward the end of last semester I
put everything off, except survival in
my classes. Now, to me that doesn’t
seem so strange around here. But cri-
tiquing academic life is not the point.

The priorities I had set at the be-
ginning of the semester mattered little
at the end. I had to do what I had to do
to pass, to “make it through.”

I justified this action - or relative
inaction - by saying that I would catch
up with all of my projects and meet all
of my goals second semester, once I
came back a “seasoned veteran,” with
my feet securely on Davidson ground
and my head, heart, and mind focused
in a different direction.

I hardly realized, as I continued to
add activities to my “to do” list, that in
my “blind ambition” I had not consid-
ered my own limitations, nor had I
factored in the need for sleep, nor had I
taken into account that there are only 24
hours in a day. I couldn't realistically
accomplish all that I wanted to.

Still, at home I rationalized . . .
Althoughclasses don’t get easier, [know
now through experience what to ex-
pect, I told myself. I won’t be trying to
find a place in the “college commu-
nity.” I won’t go through the same
emotional upheaval that I did first se-
mester.

I couldn’t

Freshmen: You still have a lot of learning

A semester at Davidson may have
tempered my idealism and may have
helped create a marginally more
thoughtful young man, but I am by no
means a “veteran.” It just took me a
semester of convincing myself of the
opposite to come to the understanding
that I don’t know and I didn’t know.:

Each step I take here at Davidson
further reveals to me the ignorance with
which I took the last.

ButI still want to know. [still want
to accomplish.

Is that enough?

T hope so, for that is all I have to
offer.

Mr. Blue-Butted M&M Man

e are back. Semester break is over,
new classes are starting, and all of our -
friends are right where we want them:

nearby.

Eating lunch today witha friénd who finished
his ex-
ams in
record
time
(and
de -
serves
all of
those
good grades he gets), I was trying to explain about
the guest on our hall who had relieved himself in
one of our hallmate’s sinks after my friend had
departed for home. I remember when I came back
from dinner more than a month ago and heard the
story first-hand, examined the evidence, and split
something laughing.

There was no way to translate that into
retellable emotions or feelings. So much of what
we find enjoyable or sad can only be experienced
first-hand.

Have you ever tried to explain to someone the
sinfully funny part of a movie, and then have your
retelling fall flat because of a lack of timing,
delivery, and the unnoticed details and context that
made the original so good?

That was the way I felt trying to explain about
that poor sink.

Everything came out flat and lifeless, hardly
deserving of a chuckle, let alone the guffaws I had
rewarded the sight with a month previous. And
this explanation was given to someone who knew
where I was talking about and could go view — at
least the setting — for himself. I finally started to
understand why it was so difficult to tell my high

school friends about some of the experiences at
college, and vice versa.

Memories are made through experience. You
have to be there to appreciate the full humor,
horror, beauty, or sadness of something. Even the
greatest storyteller can only make you feel like
you were there, not like you experienced some-
thing. The spoken and the written word never have
and never will be capable of that. We have our
memories and experiences, and they can only be
shared with those who were there, if their full
effect is to be invoked.

Because of the inadequacy and problems
associated with trying to capture something in the
retelling, [don’t think that I willeven attempt to try
to explain to high school friends, parents, or rela-
tives at home about the Blue-Butted M&M Man.

A giant, blue M&M, replete with letters and
those big cartoon eyes so indicative of intelligent
candy, was in residence on our hall when I re-
turned from break, perched atop the fire extin-
guisher case in the middle of the hall, hefting a
basketball, only a moment away from shooting.
The little fellow rules our hall, I nod to him
whenever I pass, and he always seems to find his
way into the most unrelated conversations, espe-
cially when they are carried on in his presence.

No one who hasn’t witnessed the phenom-
enon would believe it, Some of you reading may
think I’ ve gone off the deep end a little, too. I can
only urge you.to come up and see him now, while
you have the chance.. Come up to Third Little and
experience a memory; don’t leave it to someone
like me to tell it to you, come up and make it a part
of yourself.

Who knows, in 20 years we may meet some-
where and share a conspiratorial laugh about a
memory that was known only to those who were
there.

very once in a while, when I’m
B= looking, a little piece of cold

my own life to meditate on the events of the |

outside world. Over the past five weeks, one
event in particular has struck my conscience. I
hope by relating this story you, too, will in some
way be touched.

Going to church on Sunday morning has
always been a family affair for the Neiheisels.
It’s something we’ ve been doing together since
the beginning of time and will continue to, for-
ever and ever, Amen. It was always the joke at
our church that
the Neiheisels

eyes full of life. He gave a firm handshake and
asked each of us our names, first and last, though
our last name was obviously the same for all three
children.

Mr. Gerald told us about himself. “Often,”
he said, “they mix up my name, and address my
mail to Gerald Oatman instead of Oatman
Gerald.” My brothers and I grinned. “Some-
times they just send two letters, and address them
to both names.”

“Hopefully not with the bills,” my father
joked.

“Oh, no, they always get the bills right,” Mr.
Gerald said in a serious tone, obviously not
recognizing the jest in my father’s comment.

I watched Mr. Gerald all through the ser-

“vice. He sat on a chair with a cushion in a plastic
grocery bag covering the hard wooden seat.
Though we sang many carols that night, I never
saw him join in. He burped and groaned con-
stantly throughout the service, catching the amuse-
ment of my older brother and I. He was anice old
man who loved the Lord and his congregation.

So it was a the congregation

special delight to visit my parents’ new church in
Charleston, Agape Baptist Church, with all the
family members in tow. Our first visit all to-
gether was for the youth group’s Christmas pag-
eant, and despite my mother’s descriptions of the
chutch, I couldn’t help but chuckle when I saw it
—arandom old building on a busy street nestled
between a laundromat and a Subway. The total
membership of the church was fewer than 100,
including staff members.

But the honest love and fellowship of the
church was obvious as my brothers and I were
warmly greeted upon entering. We took our
seats, filling a whole “pew” of neatly assembled
chairs and sat quietly waiting for service to begin.
And then he appeared.

His name was Mr. Oatman Gerald, though it
had not always been so. His title at birth, he
confessed, was Oakman Gerald, “Like a big
strong tree,” he said. But alas, in elementary
school he could not write acursive “k,” soOakman
Gerald became Oatman Gerald, the only one in
the world, he said. And he was probably right.

Mr. Gerald was an elderly man with wrinkled
hands and an aging face. He stood in his faded
Sunday suit with a red silk rose attached to his
lapel. His glasses sat perched on his nose, hiding

— all ten or 12 of them. He prayed for their
continued commitment to the church and for a
Christian example in their lives. And then, a day
later, Mr. Gerald died of cancer. The prayer he
gave was a closing prayer, both for the service
and for his life. It was time for him to go, and he
felt it. He will no longer suffer from the pain and
agony of the cancer spread through his digestive
tract. .

Through 18 years of life, Ihave never known
anyone who has died - or known them well, at
least. I have two parents, four grandparents,
three siblings, 28 aunts and uncles, and over 50
cousins, all in good health. I am constantly
amazed by this fact. ;

But it was not Mr. Gerald’s death that
touched me; rather his life. In our ten minutes of
conversation, it was obvious he was a spirited
individual who had both loved and been loved.
His loss will be felt by that congregation.

It is very easy to get lost in the rat race of life,
if you’ll forgive the cliche, and it’s details like
these that are too easily brushed aside. For me,
the moral is simple, a reminder we all need from
time to time, especially here at Davidson: Some-
times you have to stop and smell the roses, even
the silk ones.
