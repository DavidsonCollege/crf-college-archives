Forget dieting unless you are willing to exercise

By MARK PUCKETT

Over Christmas break I went into a local
drug store to buy a Hallmark card for my
grandparents. When I walked inside, |
asked the high school cashier for the loca-
tion of the cards. “They’re right next to the
diet pills at the end of Aisle 2A,” she said.

I thanked her and walked down Aisle 2A,
noticing every edible manifestation of
Christmas spirit--chocolate-covered cher-
ries, Whitman Sampler’s Candied Nougats
and fruitcakes--in a drug store.

I passed an innumerable number of ar-
tery-hardening agents. At the end of the
aisle I saw the Christmas cards. And the
diet pills.

I picked out a card. Then I looked over
the available selection of these pills. Al-
though there must have been twenty differ-
ent brands, I remember one claim that they
all made, “Lose weight fast without get-
ting hungry.” They stated also that their
methods were “clinically proven.”

I understand why these items are allowed
on the market, but I don’t agree with the
reason. The 1980’s have become an era of
convenience in which we look always for
the easy way to accomplish our goals, We
rely on nuked food made in the microwave;
conventional cooking methods are too
slow for our pace. And many people who

wish they were fit will try anything. They —

will take diet pills for months. And of
course they will lose weight ‘because
WHEN YOU DON'T EAT, YOU DON’T
GAIN WEIGHT.

It is paramount to eat if you want to live.
Not eating is the worse way-to stay fit. I
don’t know all the scientific ramifications
of using these pills, but I do know that a
disruption of regular eating habits (regular
daily caloric intake) can affect the body’s
metabolism. :

My advice, then, follows: if you want to
stay fit and possibly add years to your life,
I recommend a combination of proper eat-

ing habits plus exercise.

The short- and long-term effects of this
program are unmatched by any others. If
you resolved to make yourself a physically
better person in the new year, then find an
exercise that you enjoy and adhere to it. If
you become bored, find another.

If you don’t enjoy exercising, then don’t

do it; but at least eat properly. Read the
labels on packages before buying them.
Peel the skin off of chicken. Find out about
what you are eating.

If you chose not to exercise or eat prop-
erly during the new year, this choice is
yours. But do me a favor--stay away from
the pills.

pounder Andy Cooke. Cooke has
not wrestled since his junior year
in high school and is “working
the rust out” of his body. He has
no difficulty with the condition-
ing, but plans to work on the
moves until they become second
nature to him.

At 190 is asophomore who has
just come off shoulder injuries.
Thomas Lane is recovering from
a football injury. According to
Binns, Lane wrestles by instincts,
pulling moves out of a hat.

Another sophomore football

player is Eric “Flea” Farmer.
Though very small for a heavy-
weight, Farmer is also very quick.
He basically enjoys toying with
his opponents until they make a
mistake.

These Wildcats are dedicated
wrestlers who face long odds;
they fill nine out of ten weight
classes and have no depth in the
lineup. Early hopes of winning
dual meets are now focused on
individual performances.

And yet, these wrestlers are
team players as shown by Clark’s
attitude. Despite the accomplish-

ments and inspiration, Clark.

downplays his status; he wants to

work with and be a part of the
wrestling team. Junior Andy
Cooke comments, “The team
accepts me gracefully. I don’t
have to prove myself like in high

Ba

school.”

For the moment, Oddo concen-
trates on training the freshmen
and sophomores and exposing
them to collegiate wrestling. Indi-

vidual performances are now the
focus of the program. With persis-
tent dedication, this young team
can be a competitive force ima
few years.

mistakes and learn from them on
the court. These periodic bench-
ings are counter-productive.

An offshoot of this lack of con-
fidence has been the lack of emo-
tion on the court. It seems that the
players are so worried about con-
forming toa system that they have .
lost their passion for the game.

Only Alan Hunter and Bill Sell-
ers exhibit any emotion while
playing. Freshmen Bruce Elder
and Sterling Freeman have
wanted to let loose, but the bench
looms for them when they make a
mistake, so they must stay com-
posed.

Magic Gaines said earlier in the
season that a fine line exists be-
tween being a basketball player

“and ‘being a fobot. ‘Despite

Gaines’ rather astute observation,
Wildcat fans still see too many
machines and not enough people
out on the court. ©: -

The cause is obviously the atti-
tude that Hussey has taken regard-
ing this team.

Unless this attitude changes,
and unless Hussey catches on to
the realities of the game, Wildcat
players and fans alike will be. in

for a long séason.

TOURNAMENT, from page 11

Davidson started strong against Harvard,
holding a 38-27 halftime lead. After the
Cats built the margin to 15, Harvard went
on a run to take the lead 50-47 midway
through the second half.

The Cats clawed back, however, behind
junior Mo Gray who finished with a team-

high 21 points. Alan Hunter put Davidson
ahead to stay with a jumper with 2:17 left
and Gray followed with a three-point play
for a 63-59 lead.

In the first round game against Davidson,
Air Force sharpshooter Ray Dudley hit a
three-pointer with two seconds remaining
to give Air Force the victory 48-45.

The Wildcats were down by as many as

nine in the second half but fought back.

behind the strength of junior Jay Schmitt
who scored 13 of his team-high 17 points in
the game’s last half. Davidson capped the
comeback when Sterling Freeman re-
bounded a missed shot and scored to tie the
game 45-45 with 40 seconds left.
Davidson held Air Force, who was aver-
aging 90 points per game, to under 50 for
the first time this season. Dudley, averag-

ing 27 points, was held to 20, hitting seven

for 24 from the field. £6

The final shot came after an Air Force
timeout with 12 seconds to go. Despite
good Cat defense, Dudley sank his shot
from the NBA three-point line which is
four feet beyond the NCAA line.

Schmitt, Davidson’s starting center,
made the all-tournament team, averaging
14.5 points and seven rebounds per game
for the Wildcats.

HOOPS, from page 11

Coach Bobby Hussey had
chance to smile a little during and
after the contest. “Things came
too easy earlier and we had a
tendency to not make that extra
pass later,” Hussey explained as
to why Florida International came
back towards the end.

A week ago Wednesday,
Davidson losta tough one at home
to Maryland-Baltimore County
72-69. It took nearly four minutes
for the Wildcats to get their first
basket, but soon they found their
intensity and took a 34-32 lead at

the half. The first half did, how-

ever, include a lot of sloppy ball
handling by both teams.

Midway through the second
half, it looked as if the Cats might
run away with the game after
Hunter got two jumpers in a row
and Paul Denmond got a steal and
a layup to put Davidson up 57-50.
Maryland-Baltimore County
soon answered, however, with a
10-2run and the game was nip and
tuck until the final buzzer.

With 1:47 to play, Elder, who

led all scoring with 27, hit a shot
to bring the Cats within two at 66-
64. After Maryland’s Jeff Rey-
nolds and Kenny Reynolds scored
consecutive baskets to put the Re-
trievers up by six, Elder re-
sponded again by canning a 3-
pointer with 38 seconds left to cut
their lead to 70-67. Davidson
immediately called time out to set
up its press. Gaines fouled Jeff
Reynolds, who missed the one-
and-one. The Cats needed a quick
3-pointer to tie the game. Gaines
shot but missed; Freeman re-
bounded but as he was trapped in
the comer, put up a hurried shot
that hit the side of the backboard,
which the referee called out of
bounds.

After the ensuing foul, Larry
Simmons made both ends of the
one and one to ice the game. Elder

‘ made an uncontested layup with

two seconds remaining and
Davidson, for some odd reason,
was denied its time out that it tried
to call after the shot was made, an
unusual circumstance for the
home team.

“T thought we would have two
seconds to hopefully get the steal

and put one up,” said a dis-
gruntled Hussey. “We made too
many mistakes and let up defen-
sively and mentally down the
stretch,” he added.

Last Wednesday night the Cats
lost a close game to Appalachian
State 75-65. Appalchian, the only
Southern Conference team to play
Davidson this year, broke open
the game in the last two minutes to
win a game that was much closer
than the final score. When Jay
Schmitt hit a jumper with two
minutes left, Davidson pulled
within four points. However, the
Mountaineers scored four straight
points to take an insurmountabble
lead with 1:10 left. Davidson was
led in scoring by freshman Ster-
ling Freeman with 12 points.

In Davidson’s first game ever
with Northern Illinois Saturday
night, the Cats fell in a hard
fought game 79-74. Davidson

. Started out fast and built a nine

point advantage mid-way through
the first half.. However, the Hus-
kies came back to tie the game at
the half 35-35 despite Bruce
Elder’s 17 points.. In the second
half, the Huskies built a 12 point

‘Yead: Davidson then got on track

as Mo Gray had his best game of
the season as he erupted for 16
points. However, the Cats were
unable to stop the. Huskies’ big
men as NIU answered every
Davidson run. The Cats pulled
within four points with six min-
utes left, but they could get no

closer-as NIU went home with a
hard fought victory.

Davidson’ next home game is
tonight at 7:30 in Johnston Gym
as the Cats try to beat the
Campbell Camels. Then the team
travels to Florida for games with
Florida International and Central
Florida. 2
