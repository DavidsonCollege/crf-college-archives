Wildcats produce tale of two halves in Centennial win
Squad needs — and wants — more practice at playing with 42-point lead

By Micuact J. Kruse
Editor in Chief

After scoring 42 unanswered
points in an incredibly impressive
first half, the Wildcats faltered
somewhat in the second, managing
only five first downs and 71 yards
of offense.

But who can blame the Wild-

FOOTBALL
Notebook

cats for their rather lackluster game-
ending performance?

After all, it’s not every day
they play a half protecting a six-
touchdown advantage.

Considering Davidson’s often
heartbreaking recent gridiron his-
tory, Wildcat fans probably have a
better chance of seeing the
Richardson Field bleachers full than
their team jump out to sucha gaping
halftime lead.

-“T’ve never come out of'a half
up 42 points,” said quarterback
Tommy Dugan, who. threw for a
pair of touchdowns and ran for an-
other.

“So it was kind of amazing.
It’s certainly not something we’re
used to, but hopefully we can keep
that drive going.

“We just need to execute better
(in the second half). We’ve got to

come out more mentally focused’

when we’ ve got a lead like that, so

wecankeep scoring points the whole
way.”

“Being a young football team,
we’ ve not been in that experience
before,” coach Tim Landis said.

“At halftime, I told them that
they were playing good football,
and to go out in the second half and
take it to the next level.
meant by that was, just keep play-
ing hard, keep after it.

“I wanted to get some guys in
the football game that deserve to be
in, and have them execute as well.
And [really believe we did that for
the most part.

“We moved the ball a couple
times and just kind of came up
short.

“T think a lot of it had to with
the heat, and we were worn down a
little bit.”

.Lightning-like strikes

Two years ago — and even at
times last year — the Wildcats
would routinely dominate their op-
ponent in time of possession, but
still lose the game.

So far this season, just the op-
posite has been the case. Davidson
held the ball for only 25 minutes
and change in the season-opening
win last week versus Maryville. And
in this week’s romp over Sewanee,
the visiting Tigers actually held an
edge in possession — 15:42 to 14:18
— after the first half im which they
were outscored by 42 points.

“We've just got a lot of people
who can make plays on offense,”
said Lorenzo Moll, who had two
80-plus-yard touchdown runs Sat-
urday afternoon. “It’s nice because

What I -

they can’t just stop one guy.

“One of the tailbacks is run-
ning the ball, then it’s Roland (Wil-
liams) catching a deep pass, or
(Eric) Ferguson running or Dugan
running, soit’s just a lot of weapons
we’ ve got. It’s nice we can just go
and score sometimes at will.

“We want to be able to keep the
ball out of the other offenses’ hands,
but it’s nice to be able to have quick
strikes like that.”

“Last year, we had consistent
drives,” Dugan said.

“This year, the big plays are
going up. So I guess our time of
possession is going down.”

Indeed, a small price to pay for
having two 1-play, 80-something-
yard touchdown drives.

Ultimately though, thanks to a
more methodical — not to mention
far less prolific — offense in the
second half, Davidson won the time
of possession battle against
Sewanee, 32:17 to 27:43.

Never in doubt

This one was over early. At the
half, Davidson had 12 first downs
to Sewanee’s four, 268 yards on the
ground to Sewanee’s 92, 129 yards
passing to Sewanee’s 24, and 397
total yards to Sewanee’s 116...the
four-touchdown victory gave the
Wildcats their first 2-0 mark to start
a season since 1979...the North

who pitched in only one tackle,
made his mark with two fumble
recoveries.

from page 20

Dugan made
it 14-0 with just
over three minutes
left in the first pe-
riod, capping an
11-play, 88-yard
scoring drive —
Davidson’s long-
est on the day —
with a 22-yard op-
tion dash to the end
zone.

On the first
play of the second
quarter, Dugan
found tight end
Wes Jones ona 10-
yard scoring toss
.to give the Wild-
cats a 21-point pad six seconds into
the period.

The touchdown reception was
Jones’ first since he suffered a sea-
son-ending knee injury in the 1996
opener.

Eric Ferguson added a 21-yard
run at the 10:43 mark, deep threat
Roland Williams —last week’s hero
— hauled in a 35-yard touchdown
pass, and Moll broke through the
Tiger line for his second length-of-
the-field scamper, as Davidson
raced to the unprecedented half-
time cushion.

“We were expecting Sewanee _

to be tough,” Moll explained.
“I mean, they’re tough. kids,

@ Clif Henry (5) and Rich Hale take a break Saturday.

they hit. So we were expecting a
tough game, but we just came out
and executed.

“We've still got a lot to work
on, obviously. In the second half,
we didn’t do much at all.”

But it mattered little — if at all
— at that point.

Tiger quarterback John Stroup
finally broke the dry spell for
Sewanee with an 80-yard touch-
down runatthe 1:34 juncture in the
third quarter.

Brian Morrison notched the
Tigers’ second meaningless tally
on a l-yard plunge with 13:23 to

go.

But by that time, the Centen-
nial crowd of 3,188 — and perhaps
many of the Wildcat players as well
—had been celebrating a Davidson
victory for the better part of two
quarters.

“T thought it was going to be a
real battle,” Landis said, ‘and we
prepared for a real battle.

“T think it’s just a tribute to our
guys. On film and on paper, it
looked like an even matchup. And
it was just our guys coming out and
wanting it a little more.”

Check that. A /ot more.
