As a direct result of this. we may lose three or four

ference that we need for the big-time team. (Of course, Coach
standard, or play some ‘money’ games and make up the dif-
ference that we need for the big-time team. (Of course, Coach
Dole could produce a winning team and the whole thing would
be solved.)

Let me suggest something that seems to be a fine plan
and one that has been carried out by North Carolina State
with a wonderful degree of success. If we could hold our
own (which is really the plan as it stands now for another
year) in football and maybe play a few money games, and
use the $24,000 for the basketball team and really hire
@ top-notch coach and get a team that with the “Davidson
spirit’ could win some more games and maybe set the con-
ference on fire in a few years.

THE BUILD-UP IS THE THING

With the freshman playing, we could have a better than
even chance since some of the best talent in the state have been
contacted and show their interest in the school, but feel that
a scholarship could not be turned down from another school
if Davidson offered them nothing, and that is exactly the case
for the coming year. -

Look what State did in the few years of the Case
“ceign.”’ I believe it could be the same here, because we have
a fine reputation left over from the Nosman Shepard days
and the fight which the teams of the past few years have
shown has been no slouch. We could fill the gym for every
game and maybe the new Charlotte Colliseum. The poten-
tial spectator is here, but the team isn’t. Johnston Gym-
nasium wouldn't hold half the people who wanted to get in
if we won more than half our games and met State or
Duke in a close game.

PLOWING PROFITS BACK

Then, and it is not preposterous to think of success, the
pay-off would come. The profits could then be invested in the
other teams of Davidson and with partial success, the name of
this school would spread in athletics more than it has in
scholastics.

As you know the athletic situation at the college is not at
its best with most of the coaches leaving for various reasons,
and with the wins coming in slowly, but something can be done
and the above is my suggestion. Maybe as alumni, you can help!

In the field events the Cats

such stellar performers as big
Bill McNeely, Gene Pierce, and
Frank Cenegy in the shot and

Selected by the votes of the fra-

Wildcat Of The Week

By BILL BRADFORD

Baseball occupies the limelight
this week and even though the
Wildcats haven't fared the best this
Spring, we feel that they deserve
special mention. Especially one in
particular; he’s none other than Jsh
Bennett. There couldn't be a bet-
ter choice for this Wildcat of the
Week.

When John Bennett came to Da-
vidson last fall, it wasn’t long be-
fore everybody knew that he was
a basketball player of no small de-
gree. But with the end of basket-
ball season, Ish left the hardwaod

and came out for baseball, where he | ;

has been an invaluable addition to

Coach Dave Poole's battery of |}

pitchers.

In the nine games played so far
Ish has seen action in seven of
them. Mostly as a relief pitcher,
but in the two that he started he
boasts a .500 record. It was his
pitching that enabled the Wildcats
to avenge an earlier defeat by Clem-
son by a margin of 4 to 3.

After graduating from high
school in his hometown in Norfolk,
West Va., where Ish was a star
athlete, lettering in football, base-
ball, and captaining the basketball
team, he entered McCallie prep
school. Here he continued his bas-
ketball and at the end of the season
was named to one of the coveted
positions on the All Mid-South
Prep team. But he did not neglect
baseball and in the brief year there,
he had a pretty fair record at the
close of the season.

Ish is a member of Phi Delta
Theta. Although he is only a fresh-
man, his performances in these two

ISH ... Swisher

sports have been excellent, and be
will prove a worthy asset to the
Wildcat teams of the future. After
a somewhat hazardous trip to
Chapel Hill and Durham the first
part of the week, N. C. State wilt
arrive here Saturday and if Ish
gets called to the mound you can
be sure that he will be out there
giving his best for the team.

The games of the first week
proved to be slugfests, and it was
not uncommon to see as many as
20 runs scored in a game, [f the
season continues at this rate there
will be quite a few .500 hitters
around at the end of the year.

In other phases of the intramural
scene we se¢ that the Phi Delts
have come through with an unde-
feated season in ping pong, having
11 wins and no losses. Bill Nelson,
Gene Craven and John Alexander
proved to be too much for the Phi
Delts’ opposition as. they came
through the season without a loss.

In second place, at present, are
the Sigina Chis with an 8-2 record,
and. close by are the Kappa Sigs
with an 8-3 record.

Still in progress are the horseshoe
matches, and they will probably be
finished sometime this week.

The last. intramural sport to start
this year was tennis. Competition
began Monday and as yet verv few
matches have been played. However,
there will be several strong teams
around the league this year, with

-|the Phi Gams,. Kappa Sigs and
,| Betas being only three of thera.

 |Stronger Pack

To Meet Wildcats

State College brings a strong
Wolfpack nine here tomorrow
afternoon to face a Wildcat
nine which proved little more
than a stepping stone for Duke's
Blue Devils early this week.

Dave. Poole's on-again-off-again
charges, after pulling off a great
surprise victory over favored Clem-
son here last Saturday, lost to

North Carolina Tuesday and then:

hit their lowest ebb of the current
season when Duke walked over
them 16-1 on Wednesday.

The Cats will still own a 3-6
won-lost record when they
meet the Statesters on the local
diamond tomorrow. The Wolf-
pack, though it isn’t burning up
the Southern Conference, is in-
habiting a considerably higher
spot in the standings than the
local nine.

For a victory Voole will be
counting heavily on the potent bat
of Fred Stowe, the Belmonte out-

Bartonmen Cop
Two This Week

By MOODY SMITH

After defeating a strong Kalama-
z00 team Wednesday, 6-3, the Da-
vidson College netsmen blasted the
N.C. State tennis team by a score
of 9-0 in a somewhat one-sided
match yesterday.

‘In the State match every doubles
team and every singles man except
one was able to defeat his opponent
in straight ‘sets. Allan Strand and
Corky Clark both won love matches,
white-washing Don Kline and
Howie Greenberg, respectively.

The Kalamazoo match -was an
entirely different story from the
‘rout of State. The Cats, out to
avenge last season's 5-4 loss to the

| boys from Michigan, finally won
| the match by a seemingly safe
margin, but not until after giving
the local fans, who turned out in
| force, something of a scare. An even
split in the singles matches with
Strand, Dewey Keesler, and Corky
Clark taking their matches set the
stage for the - doubles contests
which were to decide the match.
