Suggestion...

The Davidson student body as a
whole, we think should be commended

on_the type of dances that_it is able to

hold. Its conduct on these occasions
makes up alot for its questionable action
under other circumstances, which is so
often tlung in its face.

The conduct at these af fairs f entirely
student controlled, as you know, under
the supervision of the “21 Club” made
up of the Pan-Hellenic Council, frater-
nity presidents, and independent repre-
sentatives, The only faculty members
present are present in the position of
chaperones and spectators, but actual
responsibility rests with the students.

Yet this committee would be complete-
ly powerless without the conscious and
continued support of the entire group in
attendance. With the affairs held in an
environment foreign to the campus and
away. trom the accompanying atmos-
phere of authority, it might be expected
that there would be a corresponding
let down in self control by the students,
but last week's set; we feel, is excellent
proot that such is not the case,

Perhaps there is a valuable lesson in
this tact that both student body and
administration leaders would do well to
consider, The student body has always
been left free to govern itself in practic-
ally everything having to do with pure-
ly student affairs. Their success in
these-affairs has justified this policy.

Some phases of student activity have
naturally been kept under the jurisdic-
tion of the Dean and the Executive
Committee because these matters could
not be included in the honor system or
because a faculty group is in a position
to handle them more efficiently,

There is a third classification which
neither the students nor the faculty has
heen able to control completely, Con-
sequently—there-has never been a just
system with a fully qualified agency
invested with sufficient powers to take
an adequate hand.

It would not be unjust to include the
question of damage to college property
under this head. This year, for ex-
ample, there are at least three decided
efforts to control. this question, one
which has long merited consideration.

The President of the Student Body
has announced his intentions in this
drive. His aims were included, to an
extent, in a movement by ODK. The
administration has given notice that it

will combat the question with a more
stringent executive policy. Yet we sin-
cerely believe“ that’ none will succeed
until they actually put the matter be-
fore the whole of the group that it
affects.

Perhaps the administrative _ policy
has the best chance at success, but only
after actual harm to a number of boys’
lives and no telling how much ill-feeling
and other repercussions.

In-the long run, we think, even this
plan is doomed to failure, for in a
society as democratic as is Davidson’s,
any deviation that does not arise from
the group will not be enforced: without a
struggle. In any case a better plan

«should be devised.

Why hasn't the matter ‘been brought
up before the offending group, which
is certainly. the one which should be
most concerned, for actual open dis-
cussion? Why can’t the entire student
body, meeting jointly with the faculty,
perhaps, intelligently discuss and devise
a plan with which to meet the situation.
Such a plan should certainly have more
of the approval of the students ‘as a
group than a program decided upon by
their faculty or officers.

When one thinks about it, it is really
amazing how few open discussions i
student body meetings have been
within the memory. of present student
generations. Are we not taugh in every
classroom that this is the way intelliz
gent persons settle their difficulties ?

Why should a practical application of-

this idea fail?

Perhaps too much has been said about
the problenrin this paper this year, but
we would like to see an intelligent and
practical settlement before someone
gets hurt, and not afterward.

lf we can handle a complicated prob
lem like that of the eonduct at dances
away from the campus, then we should
by-allaneans_be able to-handle_problems
in Our own tront yard. A little above
the-board discussion of all concerned
could not possibly do any harm.

On Various -Coquetries Employed
By Young Ladies in The Ballroom

To Insure Promp_ Breaking:

(From an article by Tom Cauble
in The Davidsonian, Oct. 31 1940).

Perhaps the most common stag-
bait employed by modern beauties
is the tried and true phrase: “Come
back—I've
something
tell you.” When
the young gal-
lant rushes back
to receive this
important com-
munication, he
is. never quite
able to get out
of the — young
lady what she
meant, but he
receives further meaningful and $ly
glances, and thus taps. scores of
her partners on the shoulder
throughout the evening,

them and make the average under-

friends and influenced’ pople.

‘Again many a- lively evening. is
insured by flattering the dancing
of the powerless college man. His
reaction to this is immediate, and
he promptly vows to impress his
mastery of the dance on_ her
throughout the course of the .eve-
ning.

The young ladies new to the wiles
of ballroom coquetry have used to
great advantage the most funda-
mental of all stag-stoppers—name-
ly, the wink. The success of this
artifice is practically assured and,
as it is relatively simple to execute,
it is indeed one of the most popular
ways and means.

There is nothing quie so able to

The Operating Table

By? ? ?

Last week-end marked the biggest
social event of the season with the
Pan-Hell presenting *Home-Coming
Set at the Hotel Charlotte—as if
you didn’t know. These dances Were
the best in many a year andthe girls
were the loveliest ever. However,
there were two drawbacks to the
whole set—one, the huge crowd in
the small hall—give us the Armory;
and two, were the 14-16 year old
high school “jits’. We don't think
that there were any students guilty
of this, but there certainly must
have been quite a few children -at
the dances. Suggstions to the Pan-
Hellenic Council; Outlawing alco-
hol was easy, now let's get rid of
those canabalistic gyrators.

Red Burke's hair got redder and
redder under the influence of one
Margie. In other words Davidson's
little center took his weekend in a
torrid fashion, Speaking of torrid
how many noticed the strangle-hold
Yvonne had on one Bayruski at the
end of the P.-H. figure? Woo is

for everything. (

ed all at the P.-H. banquet Friday
night by emptying his pockets which
included such articles as: a lip-
stick besmeared hankie, a ladies

Nothing else need be said about
the poor Mayor of Boys’ Town. He
deserves an “E” for etfort, and we
wish him success on his next ven-
ture. Maybe Santa Claus will bring

This corner is wondering why
Anne Wiley was trying so hard
to avoid Juicy Jesse while looking
all over for Jesse’s mother. Some-
thing tells us that Sonnie Boy has

interesting to take note of the late

Watson is still wandering around Prisis so choice that we are sav-

front of his eyes. Poor boy does not
know what hit him, but reliable
sources tell us that it was Dottie
Sue. Take graduate student Way-
man for a perfect example of, what
too many of Cupid’s arrows in the
form of Thelma will do. Another
member of this finishing school is
none other than No-Neck Lough-
ridge, who certainly does not live
up to his physical nickname. Martha

With The Staff

By DEANE WATSON

As the hours dragged on and the
time grew late, the bustling crowd
oi-would-bejournalists...began..to
grow small. Now and then a fresh-
man would conquer a long fought
headline, bring it triumphantly to an
editor’s desk, and muttering inco-
herently something about-stidying
six reviews on the following day,
would slip quietly into the late eve-
ning chill.

This is a picture of the David-

sonian office on any Monday at

Midnight, when the junior-Editors
are left re-writing stories and at-
tempting improvements on headlines
written in the rush of assembling
various pages. To write particularly
difficult headlines for special events
they find themselves thumbing
through faded pages of old bound
volumes of Davidsonians. On these
expeditions through the news of
bygone—days—wehave~come upon
many great names. of men uriforget-
able for their feats on the fodtball
field, for. their outstanding scholar-
ship, for their campus leadership,
and for their all-round ability in
the classroom’ and on the athletic
field.

These namse and pictures of alum.
ni “greats” in the Annals of Dayid-
son College makes us envy the won-
derful times that these students must
have had here, “Just think of the
host of friends he must haye had,”
we say tO ourselves; or, “think of
the hundreds of students that must
have felt a tingle of pride. as he
passed them on the campus with a
smile and a kind. word. “That fel-
low,” we exclaim, “must truly have
gotten a great deal from his life

on the campus: how lucky he was!”

Then as we continue to dream
over-the-fading pages @f dead news
in the old bound volumes of David-
sonians, a phrase comes to us that
once was so familiar and now
seems so strangely appropriate as
an answer to the wonder of suc-
cesses of these old students: “A per-
son reaps from any worthy under-
taking only what he-is willing to
put into it.” Then from this proverb
we decide that the word “luck” in
describing the success of men like
these is far from appropriate.

On the contrary, if we call their
successes “luck”, then we must con-
sider as our definition of luck, Jong
hightsof utter concentration over
volumes of ancient history, works of
Shakespeare, and multi-paged par-
allel books. We must also include
afternoons of forcing. tired aching
muscles to carry exhausted bodies
around“one more lap of cinders, or
across five more yards of green
turf. We must include the missing
of picture shows and of pleasant
evenings discussing pro and con the
popular_ questions of the day,’ for
these were the bits of “luck” that
students such as these had in leav-
ing something beside a permanent
record card for Davidson College
and Davidson students of later years
to remember them by. :

It was men like these who built
the pedestal upon which our college
now rests. True, theyreaped har-
vests-of many great-friends, and-the
admiration of multitudes, yet, their
efforts, their successes gave us the
Davidson College of which we have
a right to be proud.
