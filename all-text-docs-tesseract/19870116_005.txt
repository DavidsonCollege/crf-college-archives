Frankly speaking, “Fandango fails to excite

By PRISCILLA FAWCETTE

Austin, Texas. May ,; 1971 and
“The Groovers” are having their
last wild fling before entering the
very real and cruel adult world: all
the makings of a cliched but po-
tentially (and I underscore poten-
tially) good film, right? “Instead
this week’s pop film offers us the
colorfully boring embarrasse-
ment, Fandango.

I guess I should have gotten
the hint by the opening scene, in
which the well-meaning, mis-
chevious graduates line up at a
party to moon the startled parents
of one of The Groovers. Maybe

my expectations were too high.

But before I get carried away
with the details of this exciting
epic adventure, I should introduce
the gang: There’s Gardner, the
good-looking, worldly-wise, but
irresponsible leader of The
Groovers. His foil is Philip, an
anxious, complaining ROTC,
described by his own friends as a
“weeney.” Kenneth has bushy red
hair and has just run out on his
fiancee. Lester appears to be in a
coma the entire time, and Dorman
is the obese, quiet, intellectual
type.

Anyway (yawn) these charac-
ters set out on a pilgrimage to
Mexico for DOM. They moon
drivers, drink a seemingly infinite
supply of beer and drive danger-
ously till they run out of gas. As if
the enigma of DOM wasn’t
enough to hold our attention,’

these hell-raisers find themselves

involved in various risky es--
Capades en route.

Fortunately the scary music
and fast-pace montage warn us of
that The Groovers are about to
face “imminent death,” as they tie
their car to a moving train, shoot

fireworks in a cemetary, and
parachute from a plane.

But don’t make the mistake of
thinking this film is all fun and
games. Gardner has nostalgic
dreams of a girl running ina field,
remarkably similar to a 1970's
Breck commercial. The Groovers
also have a few serious conversa-
tions about friendship, women,
war and life. In fact this theme of
innocent, ephemeral youth on a
quest to maturation is announced,
blared, and screamed at the vie-
wer throughout the film. For as
Gardner so eloquently states in a

final toast to The Groovers, “To
us and what we were,” as Philip
interjects, “To us and what we’ll
be.” ,

I suppose one could find a few
possibly worthwhile qualities
about Fandango, such as its inter-
esting title (fandango is a type of -
Spanish dance, if you're wonder- _
ing), an occassional funny line
and a few good early seventies
songs by Cream, Carole King etc.
However none of these make the
film worth seeing. Was this film
ever popular? Why don’t we just
keep reshowing The Graduate or »
Breaking Away?

Defenestration of Prague takes College Bowl title

By MARK CHEN

The name of the team came _

~ Some people look forward to
the Superbowl. Others replay the
incredible Penn  State-Miami
Fiesta Bowl. But both of these
events are dwarfed by comparison
with the immense, universal sig-
nificance for humanity of the Col-
lege Bowl Championship Match.
It took place on Monday at 7:15
p.m. in the 900 Room.

The two teams were meeting
at the end of a grueling double-
elimination tournament. De-
fenestration of Prague, top-heavy
with ‘returning veterans of intra-
murals past, had dominated its op-
ponents. It had been ably led by
seniors Ted Davis and Dudley
Bell. They were complemented
with the speed and intelligence of
Buddy Martin, David Norris and
David Petranick. The team en-
tered the ‘finals without a single
loss.

| Nohow and Contrariwise

Memories of pets passed

from its history majors. “defenest-_
ration” means “throwing some-
thing out of a window,” and it re-
fers to Prime Minister Jan
Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, who
mysteriously fell out of a-window
and died shortly before the Com-

munist takeover of his country..

(In an aside, I challenge the team
to name the other famous de-
fenestration of Czech history).
The challenger was Turn Your
Head and Cough. It had met De-
fenestration in a match before and
had lost. Despite being their only
one, the loss put Turn in a tight
spot. Under double-elimination
rules, they. would immediately be
out if they lost again. However, a
victory in the first game would

give both teams even records. De-.

fenestration would still have a
shot at the championship in the—
extra and final game. Turn had to

win the first. game for another
chance.

Turn was ready for the chal-
lenge with a talented group of
players. It also benefited with vet-
erans such as seniors Julian
Wright and Fred Higgins. John
Hutchinson and Chip Stone had
played well throughout the tour-
nament. The talent on both teams
promised a long night.

The match was ready to begin
at 7 p.m. except for the missing
players. Bell and.Norris were mis-
sing, despite repeated calls by De-
fenestration’s captain. In the end,
Defenestration had to start with
only three players. Turn came out
strong with the efforts of Wright
and Hutchinson. By the end of the

’ first half, the score stood at 130 to
30 in Turn’s favor. Defenestration
got a boost when Norris arrived to
play the second half. The second
half saw a revitalized effort on De-

fenestration led by Davis and
Martin. Fighting against time,
they came in quickly and rushed
their answers. Despite their
speed, the game ended with Turn
on top-at 160 to 150.

They would have to play a sec-
ond match. Once again, Turn
came on strong and took an early
lead with good answers from
Stone. Defenestration hurt. itself
with early answers that turned out
‘wrong, putting them in the hole
with -15 at one point. At the mid-
game break, Turn led with 90 to
25. The second half moved almost
like a carbon-copy of last game.

Defenestration roared back with
rapid speed to take a'lead. But it
was thin, and Turn came in with a
last answer before time ran out.
Turn could not get it, and de-
fenestration won with 120 to 110.

Though Defenestration won

the championship, it was an excel-

‘lent -game by all players Both
matches were close and could
have gone either way. The Col-
lege Bowl talent has been good
throughout the Intramurals this
year. Many people looked impres-
sive enough for the varsity Col-
lege Bowl team. .

For all those interested in
playing for the Davidson Collége
Bowl team, there will be tryouts
later in the term. The tryouts will
be open to anyone who comes and
is willing to practice and play with
the team next year. They will be
held in the first week of February.
Three to four people will be cho-
sen for the final team.

For more information, ask
anyone on the Davidson team.
The members are Gordon Wat-
kins, Edwin Page, Jeff Gregory
and Mark Chen, Those interested
can also talk to Dr. Hansford

Epes.

At times, though we all may be loathe |

to admit it, the Davidson student seems a
trifle hardened to the more sentimental
moments this life has to offer. Perhaps it
is the schoolwork, or the loneliness of
being far from home; who knows —
who knows why sometimes we don’t
seem to be able to stop and feel just a little
nostalgic.

But Davidson students are not all

Barron in broken sighs, “stiff as a board.”
As one brother dug the grave, the other

engraved a stone simply with “Flower”;

chores of love, to be sure. And though the
lovable pooch was planted within the
hour, “a lot of tears dropped as a sacrifice
and memorial to Flower.”
With similar honesty and melan-
chioly, Winston Rost recalled, “my little
brother stepped on a gerbil once and pur-
ple stuff came out so we tossed it.” Over-
come with despair, Rost tried in vain, just

slate rock and titanium. Beneath the
hardness of a diamond there’s a real
beauty, a lustre, if you will. With re-
markable candor, certain Davidson stu-
dents revealed the tearful reminiscence
that ushers a pet from this world to the
next.

“The only pet m my family ever had a
funeral for was our dog, Flower,”
explained Andrew Barron ’87. The black
and white pup was the Barron boys’ best
companion when the family moved to a
farm the summer of '79. One day as
Mother Barron was driving brother Jay
and a friend to town, they discovered the
crumpled remains of Flower in the road.
The young boys brought the animal a
quarter mile back to the house in a slow
rocession of tears. “She v was ” recalled

once, to forget the terrible hand that Fate
had dealt him, launching desperately into
what would seem to be a jovial conversa-
tion with Melinda Dennis ’87. But alas,
Dennis’ own story was sadder still, “On
Christmas Eve my hamster’s throat swel-
led and his eyes bulged and his tongue
turned blue.” Ironically, by the time the
sun rose on the day most associated with
Birth and Salvation, the creature was.
quite dead. Barely able to restrain the
tears, Dennis whispered “We took it to
the vet; they take care of things like that,
you know.”

Some students told stories which pro-
vided grim reminders of the mere gos-
samer barrier which separtes this world <
from the next. Aimee Gonder '87 re-_
vealed the bizzare events that trans ired

on the day she mowed too near the con-
create slab that marked the grave of her
doberman. “When my mower hit the slab
and broke it,” recalled Gonder, her face
ashen, “the mower broke, too.” Cadet
Dean Williams ’87 (Maj. ROTC) had a
simlarly spooky tale to tell. “My gran-
mother’s cat was buried in muddy ground
in her backyard. One day after a storm
when she was walking around back there,
her foot sank down to where she could
see the Plastic stic bag. That’sreallytrue—I
promise.’

While some studets gave their pet’s
simple. funerals (Laney Gibbs °87 sadly
explained “We have Dempsey Dumpster
funerals”), others had’ surprisingly in-
volved services. Pam Wright ’88 not only
buried her parakeet beneath a feeder and
wrote it aeulogistic poem, but she intered
it below a stone with no words on it: “I
decided not to write on the stone because
it could not read.” Luckily it could under-
stand good occasional poetry.

Some, more tortured students blan-
keted their soorrow behind a partchwork
of quips, witticisms, and thereputic hilar-
ity. Brooke Knight ’88 found that he
could only bear the burden of his dog
having to be put to sleep with the support

_ that laughter lends. “My brother said that

the drive to the vet’s was like a funeral
procession because we were all driving
separate cars, so my mother said ‘except
we didn’t have the lights on.’”

Finally, even more surprising than
the guarded emotions of the students is
the probing introspection of the profes-
sors of Davidson. Searching for the right
words, John Engell, in a rare moment of
truth, disregarded the indifference often
embraced by a Doctorate degree. “Every

now and then, we, my wife and_I, get} —

calls from cemetaries urging us to by fun-
eral plots.” During one “spate” of these
calls Engell was awakened from an after-_
noon nap — he swore that such midday
interludes of somnolence were rare —
by a woman offering him two plots for

the price of one. “It seemed like a won-
derful offer so I asked her if my 17 dogs
and 39 cats could have one of the plots
and my wife and I could share the other.
Ha ha!”

Interviewer: That’s amazing: 17 dogs
and 39 cats.

Engell: No, it was all an elaborate
charade; I was having fun at her expense.
I never had a pet.

He collapsed in his chair, little able to .
hide the sorrow he obviously harbored
deep within for some departed pet __.
