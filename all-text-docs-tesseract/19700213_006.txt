It is hoped that regional
systems—of—internships can
be set up in Greensboro and
Raleigh to compliment the
program in Charlotte.

During his work Whitley
said that he defined over a
hundred possible internships
and studied the financing of
the projects.

The culmination of his
work was a report to UNCC
detailing his findings. It was
out of these findings that the
new program was evolved

Whitley stressed that the

meeting being purely organ-

izational. ?

“There “is not much dis-
agreement over the theory
of — self-scheduled’ exams,”
Coble said, “time is the is-
sue. The Senate wants the
exam period to cover five
days, while a number of
faculty members want it to
run three.”

“It seems to me that the
faculty proposal is not really
self-seheduling,” Coble .con-
tinued, “‘but I think that
some action will be taken be-
fore the end of the year, one
way or the other. If all goes
well, a new exam. schedule
could be in effect by spring
term.”

With regard to student in-
volvement in SGA affairs,
Coble pointed out that ‘Lack
of communication between
the Senate and the student
body is our biggest problem.
A great deal of this is the re-
sult of our transition to a
new system of government,
but the present situation is
still unacceptable.

“IT don’t think that the
problem can be solved over-
night,” he said, “but we are
going to try.

“Through hall discusions,
flyers and any other means
available, the Senate is go-
ing to do all it can to inform
the ‘student body of its activ-
ities and to facilitate com-
munication between students
and their representatives,”
Coble said.

The new head of the SGA
said that the principal differ-
ence between himself and his
predecessor is One of admini-
strative style.

He was critical of former
President Hobbie’s ‘failure
to differentiate his personal
and public activities,”  al-
though he went on to point
out that he did not necessari-
ly disagree with either.

Coble went on to point out
that, with regard to his per-

sonal priorities, his duties
to Davidson would come
first.

“Peter was willing to do
a lot of work personally,”
Coble continued, ‘As a result,
a lot of people were confused
as to what was actually go-
ing on. I prefer to spread. out
responsibility and to period-
ically check on the progress
of the responsible commit-
tee or individual.

“Clear objectives and
deadlines can help our com-
mittee system to work more
effectively,’ said Coble. ‘Ef.
fective delegation of respon-
sibility will be a primary
aim of this administration.”

“Our purpose is not just
to pass legislation,” Coble
said. “‘A student government
should be measured by the
services which it provides
for students.

“We will seek to fulfill
our obligation to the David-

Fellows Tap 6,
Change Name

Following intensive interviews and group activi-
ty sessions at: Montreat, N. C., Feb. 6-8, the North
Carolina Fellows Program selection committee chose
six Davidson freshmen: Spencer Clark, Bill Endy,
Reggie Kennedy, Wally Kernodle, Gary Stephen Long,
and Mike Wheeler.

This North Carolina Feliows Program is the
name of the newly reorganized Richardson Fellows
Program. The Smith Richardson Foundation chartered
a new organization known as the North Carolina Lead-
ership Institute, Inc. so that the experiences gained
through. the fellows pilot program could be more
extensively utilized.

Spencer Clark of Lumberton, North Carolina who
works in the “Y” program and is a member of the
sailing team. Clark plans to use his fellowship by
working in the inner city in the North.

Bill Endy of Worcester, Pennsylvania Who plans
to major in Economics. Endy is active in debating and
hopes to use his fellowship by performing legal aid
work in New Orleans.

Reggie Kennedy from Charlotte, North Carolina
is active in the recruiting of black students at David-
son and hopes to major in either sociology or political
science. He is interested in an internship connected
with some phase of city government, particularly
housing, with this being a possible career choice.

Wally Kernodle of Burlington, North Carolina
tutors a young person in the STEP program and also
works with a high school church youth group. He is
unsure of his vocational plans, but hopes to have an
internship in some part of social work.

Gary Stephen Long from Gastonia, North Carolina
is interested in an internship of government work or
the pursuit of a job in the French-speaking territory
of Canada.

Mike Wheeler of Blacksburg, Virginia is involved
in the STEP program and would like to pursue an in-
ternship in the field of education.

Vice’ President Cecil Bur-

his organization would at-
tempt to improve the living
environment of the David-
son student through the en-
cOUragement of continued
dormitory renovation.

The RMC would also pro-
mote improved interperson-
al relations in the dorms

of which take place at the
end of the freshman year.

situa
présent

Asked whether he thought
that the RHC program was in
completition with the frater-
nity system, Burney replied
that he thought that the two
systems were complementary
rather than competitive.

The Vice President is a
member of a social. frater-
nity, unlike his predecessor,
Tom Opie.

“I believe that there are
other forms of social organi-
zation which are better that
the fraternity system:” said

Burney.

“But I don't think that
Davidson should abolish fra-
ternities until we have de-

veloped another program to
provide equivalent social op-

portunities for the student
body.”
“We are not yet ready,

in terms of facilities and
overall program, to imple-
ment another system, so I am
not, in favor of immediate
abolition of fratetnities.

“The RHC should now be
developing such .a program
so that we can be ready to
act on the Trustee recom-
mendations on _ social pat-
which will be releas-
ed in the spring,” Burney
said.

The Vice President said
that ‘present student living
environment is marred by
unreasonable search of ‘stu-
dent rooms by college per-
sonnel.

“While we are at
son,” said Burney, “Our
dermitory rooms are oir
homes. They aren't much,
but they are ours; and I
don’t think that we want
our privacy invaded by any-
one.”

David-

“T have written a letter to
the Dean of Students.” Bur-
ney said, “making it clear
that unreasonable search is
not acceptable and that a
recurrence of past incidents
will move-cus to action.”

“I don't want to try the
Dean, Burney said. I merely
want to work out a solution
to our problem. College per-
sonnel should be welcome in
the residence halls, but as
friends, not raiders."

“I don’t want to try the
