Leaving the Academy, he en-

record, being selected as All-South
Atlantic end in football, a pitcher
on the baseball nine, and center
on the basketball five.

GENE McEVER

The “Bristol Blizzard’ came to
Davidson fresh from the realms of
competition, and arrived here with
an up-to-date knowledge of what
a backfield man should do. Inci-
dently, he knew how to practice
what he preached.

Gene Camp kere straight from
the University of Tennessee where
he established himself as an All-
American halfback, All-Southern

for three years and on top of that,

was the leading scorer in the

country. ‘

Acclaimed by Major Bob. Neyland as
the “greatest and smartest” player he
had ever coached, Gene also” received

Under his tutelage, Davidson
men have placed first in the South-
ern Relays at Georgia Tech, at the
University of Virginia Indoor
Games, ‘at the Southern Confer-
ence Indoor meets, and in the State
meets. Many of the present State
records have been established by
Davidson men under Captain
Pritchett, such as Currie, Coch-
rane, and Frazier.

Whittle tied the World’s record
in the 70-yard hurdles. Cochrane
placed in the Penn Relays, while
other men have carried off honors
in sectional and national meets
among the following events;
hurdles, 440, High Jump, the 880,
mile, two mile the ‘sprints and in
the shots.

All these points only serve to illustrate
one fact. A fact well known to all who
know Captain Pritchett. That is+in
losing him, Davidson will have lost’ its
best friend in athletics and in other
fields. We may consider ourselves for-
tunate if we obtain a man who can do
half 4s much as Captain has done to create
good clean athletics here. Personally,
this column believes he has done more
to sustain “that wildcat spirit” than any
other individual.

Sophs Mop Up In Class
Golf With Opponents

The Sophomores mopped up last week

the interclass golf competition by
winning each of its three matches
against the Seniors, Freshmen and the
Juniors respectively. The Sophomore
team consisted of the following: West-
all, Stewart, Carlson, and Branton. Jim-
my Westall, number one Sophomore
player caused an uproar after missing
an approach shot when it is estimated
by those who saw it that he threw his
number 8 about half-way across the first
fairway from the eighth green. Westall,
throughout the matches, consistently shot,
in the low eighties.

The Sophomores and the Juniors will
play in the finals for the championship of
the interclass tennis tournament. The
Freshmen were supposed to play the
Sophomores last Friday but the Fresh-
men were unable to get! a full team to-
gether so were forced to forfeit the

Choices

Looking back over the past year of
athletic history at Davidson, certain ex-
ponents of Wildcat prowess stand out in|
our minds as having done special service
toward the betterment of various team
records during their respective sched-
ules of contests with other teams.

These men have been placed on Tue
DavipsonrAn’s roll of honor for sports,
and their names appear in the box above
this column.

Although the past season saw the “thin
red line” going up against some of the
the hard
fighting ‘cats split even in games and it

strongest teams in the country,

was during these contests that many
stars were revealed. However, six men,
in our opinion, exhibited the most con-
sistently outstanding work during one
of the hardest seasons evér put before
a Davidson grid machine.

Such warriors of the gridiron as A. Vf
Potter, “Tubby’ Hand, Henry Cathey,
Cole Windham and Dick Johnston cer-
tainly deserve mention, but those chosen
for particular honors are: Johnny Mack-
orell, twice All-State back, All South
Atlantic and honorably mentioned for
the All-American eleven; Jim Morgan,
holder of the Basketball Team Spirit
Trophy and At State End has won
cight varsity letters during his last three
years here; Dewey Hutchins, has
lugged the Spheriod into the promised
land so often and has made so many
games sensational, particularly the Dea-
con contest, that we feel he has a place
well carned; John Siewers, recognized
as one of the most outstanding lines-
man in the state; George Wingfield,
alternate Captain of the team and vet-
eran ball carrier; and J. Lee, who
proved himself one of" the” greatest de-
fensive linesman of the past seasons.

Courtney leads the basketball
field by virtue of his high scoring hon-
ors and his consistently good showing
for the past three years; Maurice Pea-
hody, also an ace Scorer, was selected
because of his ability to carry the fight
and his all-round good showing.

Karle Frazier for the second year
takes the forefront in the world of cin-
dermen having set two state records and
proven himself the greatest distance run-
ner ever to enter Davidson; John Lee
who won first in the J. C. Collegiate
tournament is an outstanding Vaulter
for Davidson; with John Newton earn-
ing a large number of points in each
meet to see him among the honored.

In baseball Charlie Harrf§ and Jim
Dickson were picked more for their con-
sistent playing -although at times they
were both spectacular and consistent.
Harris, was also outstanding in Basket-
ball as was Jim Morgan, tho’ we be-
lieve he was a greater help to the team
in Baseball, Jim Dickson, a sophomore,
literally saved three games for the ’cats
by his timely bunts and hits, besides
playing a good game at right field.

Bill Snow deserves a place, we think,
because of his exhibition against Charlie
Yates and other of the country’s golf
champions

Carlye Lewis and Tommy Phifer,
numbers one and two respectively of
the local team, for their individual show-

CRAWFORD MAY
GET JO HERE

Two Men Being Considered For
Diretor of Athletics

Pat Crawford showed .some interest
when informed by the Charlotte Obser-
ver that he would be seriously considered
for the post of director of athletics at
Davidson,

The big league ball player said he had
not been approached about the matter
and, off hand, could not say definitely
whether he would accept the position if
offered to him,

Pat Crawford was secretary of “Y”
while at Davidson and was outstanding
in all sports and especially in baseball
Ile took a special course in physical
education at Ohio State and also at
Springtield.

Although no meeting has been held to
determine who will succeed Captain
Pritchett, the many friends of Crawford
consider him to have every qualification
and it is known that he has always had
an ambition to take up work of this
kind as a life career.

Leonard Dick, director of athletics at
Woodberry Forest and also a former
Davidson man, is also being prominently
mentioned for the position.

Charlie Harris Pitches Well;
Mates Fail to Hit

Last’ Saturday afternoon, the David-
sonson Wildcats sank farther into the

cellar position through their double loss
to N. C. State College. The Wildcats
practically cinched the cellar after the
double-header defeat by the score of 1-3,
and 1-6. The games were originally
scheduled: for Friday afternoon and Sat-
urday afternoon but the Friday after-
noon game was ratned out, and it was
decided that a double-header would be
played Saturday afternoon.

Charlie Harris pitched the usual bang-
up game, allowing only six hits but
these hits were bunched enough to bring
home the bacon The Wildcats in out-
hitting the Pack, touched Ray Freeman,
State southpaw for ten hits but failed
to make them count in the pinches. The
Pack scored first, scoring in the third
inning. ‘lhe “Cats came back to score

Jerry Davidson another southpaw
spelled defeat for the Wildcats. David-
son allowed only three hits during the
entire nine innings, while the Pack
touched Jenkins for ten hits, making
six runs. Davidson’s only run came in
the fourth inning when Mackorell re-
deeming himself for two errors, knocked
out a two bagger and then Charlie Harris
scored Mackorell from third by a single.
The Pack scored one in the first, and
five in the fourth. After the fourth in-
ning, the game was practically ‘on ice,”
as the 'Cats never threatened after that
time. Batteries: Jenkins and Ravenel;
