A forceful presentation of the far-

chapel period Monday morning.

American opinion, according
Dr. Judd, consists of three major
tenets. First. “We know all about
it, and it’s terriblel” Second. “It’s
none of our business.” Third.
“There is no Way we can help.”

“But, do we know all about it?”
queried the speaker. “War _ has

China’s most vulnerable
are her homes and her _ schools.
‘Chinese civilization has been built

objective and the public humiliation
of Chinese women a part of the
