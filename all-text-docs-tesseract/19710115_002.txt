“One thing should come
clear, though,” he said, ‘‘and

that is my‘ role as the col--

lege staff liberal.’’ Here
‘Hobbie paused to: smile at
some private recollection be-
fore continuing his thoughts.

“Take the fraternity issue
as one example,”’ heasaid.
‘“‘No one ever really suspect-
ed that I returned to Da-
vidson just to see that one
issue to a satisfactory con-
clusion."’

According to Hobbie, the

, title of his forthcoming book

will be ‘‘On the Inside Look-
ing Out: Former Administra-
tion Foe Joins 'Em."’ Asked
about this unusual title Hob-
bie said, ‘‘Oh, it’s just some-
thing I picked up thumbing
through some old DAVID-
SONTANSs. Besides,’’ he said,
“it reveals another of the
major aspects of the book
and that is my privileged
role as an administrator
continuing intimate
knowledge of the students.”

Here Hobbie again paused
to chuckle over some pri-

vate memory. He keeps lit-
tle private in his book, how-
ever, and I asked him about
his boldness in certain
touchy instances.

“I'm not worried,’’ Hob-
bie assured me. ‘‘Eyen in
chapter nine ft do not think
I will have any trouble get-
ting the material past the
publisher. What with the re-
cent Supreme Court deci-
sions on pornography I feel
that even that chapter has
enough redeeming social

value to
law.”

I went on to ask Hobbie
how he foresaw the potential
for a book of this sort about
Davidson. ‘‘Actually,’’ _he
said, ‘‘I had little choice in
the matter.

“The publish or perish
syndrome is so strong here
at Davidson that I was wor-

Duke Goes Coed

Davidson College will

Announcement that~ the

rector Scottie Nicholls.

“Plans now call for a 50-

I don’t see any complica-

Nicholls’ added that Duke
residents would not have to
move out of their rooms on
big weekends.

The increase in the num-
ber of coeds is part of a new
program initiated by Dean
of Students Will Terry and
Registrar Richard C. Burts,
both noted avant garde mo-
ralists.

“IT would expect Dean Ter-
