‘Cats unlucky in
hoops; Gaines quits

By JOHN BURNS

UNC-W 74-Davidson 58

The Wildcats traveled to Wilmington
Thursday to battle the Seahawks of the
Colonial Athletic Conference. They
made the trip without second leading
scorer Magic Gaines, who left the team
for unknown reasons. Gaines could not
be reached for comment.

The Wildcats, even with the return of
MoGray, whoscored nine points, could
not hold off the Seahawks. UNC-W
walked away with a 16-point win.

Winthrop 51—Davidson 49

The Wildcats played better Saturday
night and took the 13-3 Eagles down to
the wire in Belk Arena. Both teams shot
around 38 percent, but the Eagles won
the game with excellent 21 for 30 foul
shooting. In comparison, Davidson
went to the line only 11 times.

The. Eagles were without leading
scorer Shawn Wise, but recovered to
pull out the victory after the Wildcats
wasted 27 seconds before fouling a
Winthrop player. After a missed one-
and-one, Darry Strickland intentionally
fouled George Henson, who hit his sec-
ond shot. Mo Gray’s desperation shot
missed at the buzzer.“

Paul Denmond scored 17 points and

extended’ his ‘streak ‘of double-figure

games to 17. No other Wildcat made

over eight points.

Appalachian State 88—-Davidson 60

The Cats hiked up to Boone to face the
Mountaineers on Monday night in
Alumni Gym. Davidson outplayed
ASU in the first half, largely behind the
effort of Jay Schmitt, who scored 16 in
the game. However, a murderous run
by the Mountaineers in the second half
did in the Wildcats as the losing streak
continued at 12.

The Cats out-rebounded App State
51-36 and once went on a 15-2 run to
pull away near the end of the half. With
17:21 remaining in the game, the score
was 37-34 Davidson. A little over 11
minutes later, it was 64-39, ASU.

This game showed Magic Gaines
absence, as Coach Bob McKillop
pointed to a “lack of leadership” in the
second half. Denmond was held to
seven points on 2 of 11 shooting.

The Wildcats did benefit from the
return of, 6’7" Paul Drobnitch, who
scored two points on an open court
dunk.

The Cats travel to South Carolina to
play the Gamecocks on Thursday and
host Wofford on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.

Baseball fans get ready...the season is here
Baseball looks for 30 wins in 1990 ©

By GIGGY MAXWELL

The 1990 version of the Wild-
cat baseball team opens its sea-
son in a little over two weeks
with a home double-header
against UNC-Asheville. It’s a
good bet that it will improve
over last years 12-27 record.

Last year’s season began
with 15 of the Wildcat’s first 16
dates being rained out. The
team never really got out of the
starting gate after that.

With this groupofCatsayear
older, an equally challenging
schedule should see them re-
turn to the 20+ win level, with
an outside shot at 30.

Here’s how thestarters break
down:

Calling the signals behind

the plate will be 5’9"/ 175_

pound Mac Chapman, a fresh-
man out of Gaithersburg, M.D.
Mac’s strong showing in the
fall season has Coach Jim
Stoeckel convinced he can
handle the pitching staff, even
though he is a freshman.

Joe Azzolino returns to play
first base and put his .325 aver-
age, 4 HRs and 17 RBIs back
into the lineup. His four home
runsled theclublast year. With
only one error last season he
‘looks ready to anchor the right
side of the infield.

Returning to hisnatural posi-

tion at second base is Mikio
Aoki (.296, 3 HRs, 25 RBIs).
Aoki filled the catching spot
last year. He made the transi-
tion well and led the team in
RBIS.)

The player to watch this sea-
son is shortstop Robert Een-
hoorn. Eenhoorn isa freshman
from Rotterdam, Netherlands,
and wasa member of the Dutch
National team. He has already
been named a pre-season All-
American and is a legitimate
pro prospect. The middle aged
men that you see drooling in
the stands will be Major
League scouts. Catch him
while you can.

At third base will be sopho-
more Mike Liebdzinski (. 261,0,
18). Lebo led the wildcats in
1989 with 111 assists and 17
double plays.

_ Peter Hughes (.383, 0,5) will
roam right field and hopefully
stay healthy for the entire sea-
son, Last year a hand injury
forced Hughes to miss 24 of the
39 games. Despite the power-
limiting injury, he led the team
with a .383 batting average.

Resident speedster Ron _

Krnacik (.295, 2, 19) returns to
play center field and_ steal
bases. He had 16 thefts and 33
runs scored. -

Left field is rather crowded at

this stage with Ralph Isernia
(.207, 0, 6), Lin Williams (.226,
0,3) and Dan Cotton (.256, 0, 4)
vying for the position. All will
likely see playing time in left
field and should share the DH
spot.

Pitching was last year’s sore

thumb as opposing batters tat-
tooed the Wildcat staff. Oppos-
ing teams had a 301 average
and scored just over six runs
per game. ~

Greg Wilcox anchors the
Starting staff. His 3.77 ERA,
five wins and 88 1/3 innings

oo ee

pitched led the Wildcats last
year. Wilcox is looking for
double figures in the win col-
umn this season.
