Presidential Dismay At W & M

At the College of William
and Mary some 212 students
have signed an open letter
calling for the resignation
of W&M President Paschall.

The letter accused the pres-
ident of following a ‘“‘reac-
tionary. and misguided policy
of educational leadership."

Miss Nancy Verser,. acting
editor of The Flat Hat. the
W&M student. newspaper.
said that the president had
told her that all students

Presbyterians Approve

“I don't see how. vou can
be a Christian without being
Nberal.’ said Dr... Matthew
Lynn. the newly elected mod-
erator of the Presbyterian
Church, U.S

Before adjourning Apri) 30.
the 109th General Assembly
of. the Presbyterian Church.
U.S. approved a resolution
inviting the General -Assem-
biy of the ‘United Presby.
terian Church in the U.S.A.
to study a plan of reunion
with them. The two churches

who had signed the letter
would be asked to defend
the accusations in the let-
ter in the presence of their
parents in the president's
office.

However. Paschall has
denied making such a state-
ment.

One sophomore reacted to
the letter by circulating a
letter in support of Paschall
and collecting 160 signatures.

Evolution

have been split since the
Civil War.

The Assembly reversed an
86 year old stand holding
evolution ih conflict with the
Christian faith.

A resolution asserting the
right of young men to con-
scientious object in any way
they choose also passed. It
included a_ section urging
Congress to provide suitable
alternatives in military or
civilian service for conscien-
tious objectors.

Blacks Take Over Belmont Building

Seven black students at
Bélinont Abbey College held
ihe Gaston Science Building
atthe college for alittle bet-
ter than ten hours on Tues-
day. Taking over the build.
ing at approximately 4 am,
they relinquished their con-
trol at 2:30 pm.

The takeover was without
incident except for the -un.
timely. and unwarranted. in-
terference of Gaston. County
Sheriff. Divight L Beam
‘Beam arrested Howard Ful-
ler. a militant who had spok-
en fo.the Abbey student body.
for “trespassing:”” Fuller had
‘been acting as an advisor
to the black students and as.-
@ go-between with the college
administration.

After an hour of meeting
with the black students, the

Very Reverend Jude Cleary.
0.S.B.. President of Belmont
Abbey College. said that. he
foresaw future discussion and
a possible . solution to the
grievances’ stated by the
Union.

‘He said that he hoped that
Falier would act as a spokes-
man for the. black: students.
He stated further. however,
that Belmont Abbey has no
financial resources for a
Black studies program at the
present time.

Father Jude criticized
Beam for his arrest of Ful-
ler and three other “Abbey
students. “Nobody.” said
Father Jude. ‘‘requested the
sheriff's presence on campus.
as far.as I know. Our whole
purpose was to avoid the
use of civil authority.”

Frolics, and the report cov-
ering curfews and other ad-

SGA Budget Has
Large Surplus

By TOM SINKS
Staff Writer

Two-thirds of the SGA bud-
get still remains unspent with
a month to go in the school
year.

According to Andy Good-
son, the SGA treasurer, ap-
proximatety $2225 is left in
the SGA account. The approv-
ed budget for the SGA is
$2975 for the 1968-69 year.

Goodson said that there was
about $2600 in the SGA ac-
count when Peter Hobbie
took office.

Hobbie, SGA president. in-
dicated that part of the sur-
plus resulted because the
student exchanges. program
has not been implemented
this year and because less
has been spent on the speak-
er symposium than was ex-
pected.

The student exchange pro-
gram was budgeted $350 and
the speaker fund $1000. Only
$350 has been spent for a
speaker.

$300 has been informally
allocated to finance Hobbie’s
tenday trip to El Paso,
Texas for the National Stu-
dent Association (NSA) con-
vention.

The Senate has neither ap-
propriated nor refused to ap-
propriate this outlay: but
Hobbie has insisted on keep-
ing it in the budget,

However, freshman Senator
Cecil. Burney's proposal that
money be spent. ‘to bring a
nationally famous speaker to
campus met with Hobbie's
disapproval. .

Hobbie indicated to Bur-
ney and to the Senate that

Passed

of Responsibility. said this
week that he would await
a Tecommendation from the
faculty committee.

The president said that
students would have a voice
in such recommendations
through the three student
members of the SLC.

Student committee mem-
bers are SGA President Peter
Hobbie, junior Joe Kilpat-
trick and sophomore Dick
Allison.

... Fraternity Cooks

(Continued From Page 1)
replied that the federal mini-
mum of $1.60- per hour phis
overtime for work done over
the forty hour limit was to
be used. Others present dis-
agreed, claiming that a fair

wage should appreciably
taise the cooks’ standards of
living.

Some fraternity men pre-
sent attacked the figures of
the group, claiming that the
sheet. left out payments to

the cooks, other than take-
home pay, which are signi-
ficant. Sigma Chi House
Manager’ Mike Milton point-
ed out that his house pays
all of the cook’s Social Se-
curity. provided a five-week
vacation with pay. and takes
caré of some of. their taxes.

Pika President Sam Tall-
man noted that the Pika
cooks réceived his house's ex-
cess food. ATO House Man-
ager Clinton Stretch said that

the cuoks’ job were desir-
able to them at the present
wage rate, as witnessed by
the fact that they stay on
the job when higher pay and
shorter hours were available
elsewhere.

Several of those present
pointed out the fact that the
cooks’ work unduely long
hours. It was also argued
that. there is an inordinate
disparity between the pay of
manual and non-manual lfa-
bor on the Davidson campus.

John F. Callender, instruc-
, tor of Classies, observed that,
“The paternalistic and per-
sonal nature of the relation-
ship of fraternaty men being
what it is, fraternity men
would do well to gain the
good will of the cooks by im-
proving their salaries before
they demand a change.”

Noting that polarization of
opinion had been ‘reached,
Phillips adjourned the mect-
ing. stating that another
would be held in the next
week to see what progress
had been made. It was point-
ed out that, in the face of
fraternity refusal to make
the changes, action by the
college might be sought.

Pyeatt said that the figures
on the Beta Theta Pi cooks,
as contained on the commit-
tee’'s sheet were incorrect.
He noted that the correct fig-
ures are $60 per week for 41
hours work.

he thought this money, if
no spent, should;be returned
to the college.

But he indicated to a re-
porter that he was generally
in agreement with the idea.

Appropriations for the Hon-
or Court have also been given
at least informal approval.
Reporters were unable to de-
termine whether official ap-
propriation has been made.

But according to SGA Sec-
retary Tom Vernon. the Hon-
or Court had requested only
$27 .and. was given $150, fer
reasons unknown.

OF the $750 that has been
spent under Hobbie. only two
appropriations. were formally
approved by the Senate.

The Senate appropriated
$350 to pay John Gilligan.
who spoke at the Great Is.
sues Symposium in March.
This item was part of the
formally approved budget.

The second appropriation
earmarked $250 for Belk
Dormitory projects and the
RHA.

The remaining $150 that has
been spent has been spent
to pay bills for office sup
plies. telephone calls ‘and
similar expenses. Andy Good-
son, the SGA treasurer. «said
that he ordinarily pays these
bills: after checking with. an
SGA official to make sure
it is.a valid expenditure.

Hobbie said that he felt
he had the tacit approval of
the Senate in paying for
these general expenses. Hob-
bie’ said that he “was not
going to concern the Senate
with Just general expendi-
tures.”

Althqugh this fs the third
year inéa row there has been
a surplus in the SGA treas-
ury. Hobbie does not plan
to reduce his budget request
for the 1969-70 year. He said

the .SGA budget request
would be approximately
$3000.

Burney Leads Freshmen
With Breakfast Protest

. Freshman Senator Cecil
Burney precipated a small
crisis in the Sénate Execu-
tive Committee Wednesday
night by issuing a personal
call to freshmen to go to the

breakfast, which they nor-
mally miss, on Thursday
morning.

138 students ate breakfast
Thursday morning, as com-
pared to an average of 50
who eat on most mornings.

In a mimeographed letter
to all freshmen, Burney
called for the ‘eat-in’ in
order to show that Slater
Food Service could not serve
“all the freshmen who want-
ed to eat the breakfast his
fees paid for.’'

The protest was aimed at
the early serving hours for
breakfast (7:15 to 8:15 a.m.)
and also the fact that stu-
dents are paying for break-
fasts they don’t eat, and Bur-
ney hoped to prove that the,
food service was not prepar-
ed to serve them.

The move was countered
by SEC member Sterling
Abernathy, who called cafe-
teria manager Klaus Klee-
burg late Wednesday night
and warned him to expect
about 200 students for break-
fast.

SGA President Peter Hob-
bie intervened on the side of
Abernethy. In a 30 minute
conference with Burney late
Wednesday night, Hobbie ac-
cused Burney of using stu-
dent government supplies
without authorization.

Burney had charged the
mimeographing expenses to

the Senate, but had left a

note explaining that he would
repay the cost from his own
money.

Abernathy, who headed ef-

In the first place . their
work is almost entirely ori-
ginal. With several songs P)
from the “Mr. Bojangles”
man, Jerry Jeff Walker, and
using one or two other writ-
ers sparingly, their work is
fresh. ‘

Secondly, they are a step
beyond the folk music which
coffeehouses have spawned
from their outset, They move
beyond folk and folk-rock in-
to a realm of ‘‘almost rock."
Their material is similar to
that of a group such as We
Five.

And then the final distinc-
tive feature, a dependence
more on their musical talents
than on their rapport with
the audience.- Their work is
polished.

The lead vocalist with the
group, and certainly the eye-
catcher, is Erica Schmitz. A
tall, pretty blonde, she has
an alto voice which ranges
from soft to extremely loud.

With the Davidson au-
dience. Erica seemed a bit
uncomfortable. Her smiles
seemed forced. and during
the break she noted only
“One more school and then
back to New York.”

Dick Seale, sings the male
lead and plays the lead
guitar. He smiles as he sings,
and seems to come to the
front on the softer songs. A
sensitive ‘performer, Seale
stood out on opening night
with two of Walker's songs.

seems to be Jon Addelson. group of outside consultants,
His songs form most of the alumni, and members of

Davidson’s faculty, admin-
istration, and student body,
who discussed plans for
Davidson's future.

Three’ major topics were
discussed, the Experimental
College, admission _ policies
and student internships.

The Experimental College.
an idea developed at David-
son by sophomore’ Rich
Cowart, who also headed the
first Free University, is a
program jin which eligible
students would be permitted
to originate projects outside
of the formal curriculum and
receive college credits upon
the successful development
of those projects. ..

Although the specific pro-
gram was delayed for revi-
sion, the meeting endorsed
the general idea as being a
good way to expand the edu-
cational opportunities David-
son could offer.

“It could possibly become
a combination of an Honors
College and an independent
study program,” said Gil
Holland associate professor
of English, who attended the
meeting.

The submitted program
was not judged to be fully
workable in the form in
which it was spelled out at

group's material, and his
‘stage personality wins what
is lost by the other two.

Addelson was. the only
member of the trio who
seemed perfectly at ease on
opening night. His humor
and his sensitivity for the
songs he wrote carried the
group well.

The most: open of the
group. he expressed later his
dissatisfaction with the talk-
ing and the laughter in the
audience during the perfor-
mance, but it was never evi-
dent on the stage.

The show will continue to-

another at 12:15 a. m., separ-
ated by two “Frankenstein”
