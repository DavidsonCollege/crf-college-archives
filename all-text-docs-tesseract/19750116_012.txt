‘Hoop-La’ Suffers Rat Wrath
As Sports Loses To Notebooks:

By BOB MILKS

As I sat watching the Buckets
game it ocurred to me that
there were many more empty
seats than there had been when
I had begun serving my sen-
tence in Kingdom Come three
years before. I realized with a
feeling of horror that even more
of my colleagues than usual
were destroying themselves in
the self-deludung search for
that elusive and terrible drug
GeePeeA.

The drug-seekers almost fell
prey to the monstrous great
worm Librarious that ravaged
Kingdom Come. The victims of
the sting from its venemous tail
were paralyzed into a condition
of total helplessness; they con-
tributed nothing to and gained
little from Kingdom Come but
sat around in a trance known

medically as Academia
Degeneratis.
The victims of Librarious had

always been around, but now it
seemed that many of those at
the game had succumbed to
their own brand of lethergia.
Few of those seated behind my
second row could be bothered to
stand up and cheer, some going
so far as to yell at us, “Down in
front!’’ Puzzled, I turned anu
asked the reason for their ob-
vious lack of enthusiasm.

“Well, you know how it is,’
replied the first. ‘I’ve got to
stay cool to keep up my image,
and you sure don’t look cool
jumping up and; down

screaming. What would all my
cool friends think if they saw
me acting like that.”

“They’re lucky this game is
on Saturday night instead of
during the week,’’ another said.
“T’m a scholar and I don’t have
time on weeknights for such
trivial .foolishness; I’m con-
cerned with the problems of
mankind. :

“And on the infrequent oc-
casions when I can make it to a
game it won’t do for me to get so
upset over such an unimportant
event. What meaning will it
have two days from now? I’ve
got my dignity to maintain;
there’s no way I’m going to
make an arse out of myself for
anything so silly.”

‘What about the players and

their efforts?’’

“What do I care about the
players--I’ve got myself to
worry about.”’

“They haven’t been winnin
anyway,” said yet another. “
they’re not even going to win,
why should I bother to cheer?”

“Well, it’s been a rough
schedule.’’

“IT don’t care. I’m hard to
please, and I’m not going to
lend my support to anyone
unless they show they deserve
it. It’s too much trouble to cheer
unless we’re ahead. I’m only
going to cheer for a winner.”

‘‘Maybe they need your’

support to help build a winner.’’
“‘They’re going to have to win
before they get my support. I

may stop coming to'games; I’ve
got better things to do, like wat-

ching TV reruns.”
I turned back to the game,
mentally comparing the

cheering ghosts of previous
seasons to the present lacklus-
ter crowd. Throughout the
game the cry, ‘‘Down in front!”
floated through the air behind
me.

Down in front? To hell with
those in back.

veiled a new defensive machine
which forced the Augusta team
into 25 turnovers. Slagle
credited this defense with being
a significant factor in the two
victories.

Despite the victory over Con-
verse, Duncan was quick to
remark on the slopiness of
Davidson’s play. He attributed
the Wildcattes’ abundance of
turnovers partially to the fact
that the Converse game came
back-to-back to the win over
Augusta.

Due to the proximity of the

‘two games, he said, the team

‘just really wasn’t ready for
this one. But they came
through; they’re good ath-
letes.”’

Duncan expressed confidence
in his players’ competitive at-
titude. ‘‘They’re starting to
realize they’re good basketball
players, not just good girls’
basketball players.’’

He noted as well the close-knit
relationship among the players
off the court.

“About eight of them rode in
together to the (men’s: varsity)
game the other night, and I
don’t think you’re going to find
that sort of thing on many
teams.” <

Slagle forecasted that up-
coming contests with N.C.
State, Wake Forest, and South
Carolina will probabiy be
rugged ones.

Anderson College, which
Slagle considers possibly
Davidson’s toughest foe all
season, will enjoy the home
court advantage against the
*Cattes Jan. 17. Davidson’s next
home game is against N.C.

State Jan. 20.
