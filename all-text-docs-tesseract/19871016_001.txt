New grocery store to be built in College Union Cafe _

New facility will fill the gnp left by Food Lion’s closing

By TRIPP HELMS

Grocery shopping will soon be
as easy as going to the College
Union Cafe, according to Carle-
ton Pritchard, Director of Au-
xiliary Services.

_  Davidson’s only grocery
Store, the Food Lion at Sadler
Square, is scheduled to close
_November 1, when a new Food
Lion store opens in nearby Cor-
nelius. For students who shop at
the Sadler Square store, this clos-
ing creates a need for a’new place

to shop for groceries that is within’.

walking distance of the college. It

‘is this need that the new Union.

Cafe is being designed to fill, says
Pritchard. ©

Preliminary drawings of the
project have been done by the
Davidson Food Services. staff.
The changes in the current setup
will include the addition of*groc-
ery items and a delicatessen.

The area will be reworked so
that the door from the. side of the
Union will open into a hall that
goes into the seating area. A parti-

tion will create an area that houses
the grocery items and the new de-
licatessen along with the hot snack
counter already in place. Other
additions include an ice cream and
yogurt freezer and a microwave
oven.

Pritchard emphasizes that the
seating will not be reduced by ‘the
changes. Instead, a room and wall
will be removed and replaced with
seating area. He also plans to “use
seating space more efficiently” by
putting tables against a now empty
wall.

He predicts that traffic in the

Union Cafe will double or triple.

because of the added services.
Bob Boyd, class of ’88, con-
ducted a student survey for Pritch-
ard to determine what products
students want the new store to

carry. Over 500 students. re-
sponded to the survey.

According to the survey re-
sults, the most desired products
are apples and bagels. other prod-
ucts high on the list include potato
chips, peanut butter, milk, crac-

kers, iced tea mix, Pop Tarts, deli

meats, and aspirin. The top four
food categories chosen by stu-
dents are fresh fruits, microwave
products, cheese, and soft drinks.

Construction of the new cafe
will be handled by the college and
by Barger Construction. of
Mooresville. Work will begin on
November 2, and should be com-
pleted-on November 13. New
equipment will arrive beginning
on November 16. Pritchard
targets the grand opening of the
new facility for November 30, the
day students’ return from
Thanksgiving break.

Emphasizing that itis only an
estimate, Pritchard predicts that
the cost of remodeling will fall be-
tween: $25,000 and $30,000. He
hopes that the project will be paid
for by the first two years of opera-
tion.

Prices of grocery items will be
“competitive with Cashion’s and
Food Lion,” promises Pritchard.
Although students will not be able
to purchase grocery items with
their meal cards, Pritchard says

Carleton Pritchard, Director of Auxiliary Services

that such an arrangement “is a
possibility for the future.”
Pritchard has met with the
Union Board, the Union Planning
Committee, and the administra-

en Jones

tion, and all have “heartily en-
dorsed” the plan. With prepara-
tions made and the work ready to

begin, Pritchard says, “I’m as ex-

cited as the dickens about it.”

Davidson purchases
new VAX system

By TOBY TRUOG

Over the summer, Davidson
‘College installed a new central
computer system, the DEC VAX.
It replaced the old PRIME com-
puter which has been in use since
(1981.

The DEC VAX, whi ck. cost
over half a million dollars, was
secured by Computer Services Di-
rector John Casey through his
negotiations with the Digital
Equipment Company (DEC). The
purchase is part of a 5-year plan
for the Davidson computer center.

According to academic prog-
rammer Elizabeth Rigby, “‘the

PRIME system was bought in.

1981. That’s a long time to have
one system. The new VAX is ap-
proximately four times faster than
the PRIME and it allows for more
overall communication.” |

In order to provide a smooth
transfer of accounts to the DEC

VAX, the PRIME system will still
be used during the fall term. Cur-
rently, all faculty and students
have accounts on both systems.
Furthermore, a number of pack-
ages and programs, such the two
statistics programs} SPSS and
SASS, can be used'on both sys-
tems.

One of the main advantages of
the VAX is that it greatly expands
available software options.

“We will now have access to
programs that do many of the
things that people here are inter-
ested in doing. Davidson College

_will be in the mainstream of

academic software,” noted Assis-
tant Director of Academic Com-
puting John Savarese. 4
The VAX system is currently
one of the more popular central
computing systems among liberal
