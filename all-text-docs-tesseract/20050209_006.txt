Kenneth Smothers, 51, died of a heart attack on Saturday, January
29, 2005. He was born on May 8, 1953 in San Antonio, Texas. He is sur-
vived by his children, Crystal, Cara and Casey, and his grandson
Ethan. Other survivors are his mother and father, Elaine Danaher and
Ernest Smothers and his siblings Randy, Vikki, Trisha, Michelle,

Melody and Diane.

For the past few years, Ken had made Charlotte his home, where he
focused his life on the Urban Ministry Center. Here he became a sym-
bol of hope not only for those less fortunate, but for staff, volunteers,
artists and visiting students from third-graders at Trinity Episcopal
School to college students at UNC-Charlotte and Davidson. He was
instrumental in the development and success of ArtWorks 945.He was
a spokesperson for social change through the work of Homeless
Helping Homeless, and served as a delegate to events in Washington,
DC and at Emory University. He regularly facilitated "Faces of
Homelessness" panels in the community.

Many knew Ken as a gifted vocalist, woodcarver, gardener, soccer
team manager and poet. He authored two books: “Shades of Blue:
and “Sometimes I Want Everything:

Poems, Prayers and Rants”
Haikus of Love.”

Ken's presence was larger than life. His tender heart, warm spirit
and deep caring for all people, and his accomplished writing all con-
tributed to the breakdown of stereotypes in our community. He will

be missed by many.

‘Bedroom Farce’ sure to please audiences

By SARAH SAMS
Arts & Living Editor

Head to the woods, lovers, with your tents
and double sleeping bags. But let’s be honest
(with a wink and a nod to Shakespeare’s
Midsummer’s Nigh Dream), “the course of
true love never did run _ smooth.”
Furthermore, if it did, then who would want
to hear about it? Alan Ayckburg uses this
reality to his advantage in the theatrical com-
edy “Bedroom Farce.”

The Theatre Department’s upcoming per-
formance of Ayckburg’s play ushers in to
Duke Family Performance Hall three bed-

rooms, four quirky couples, and comedy
showcasing witty word play and the highest
humor there is to be found in lovers’ predica-
ments.

The central predicament of the play, which
is directed by Professor of Theater Ann
Marie Costa, is the struggle of Trevor
(Graham Ray ’07) and Susannah (Annie
Wadman ’06) to make their young marriage
work. Their whirlwind marital problems
inundate the bedrdoms of three other cou-
ples—their newlywed friends, Kate and
Malcom (Melanie Farmer ’07 and Jonny

Barlett ’05); Trevor’s past flame, Jan

(Glynnis O’Donoghue ’07) and her husband

Nick (Rory Huntly ’06); and the last the bed-
room of Trevor’s parents (Ryan Hastings ’05
and Hannah Legerton ’06).

“Essentially, the play is centered around
relationship problems. Everyone has a rela-
tionship in their life that bothers them just a
bit, if not alot.

“So, what better way to spend the night

than watching someone else’s problems and ~

not dealing with your own? Call it happiness
at the expense of others, but it is a really
good time,” encourages Hastings.

Though “Bedroom Farce” will prove a
good time for its audience, it won’t stop
there. The slapstick humor is but one genre

wardness, puns, and more. provide
some type of comedic relief for all),
and the humor is but one provocation
of the production.

“One of the things that’s really won-
derful about Alan Ayckburg is that he
walks this line between comedy and
serious thoughts,” says Costa of the
well-known British playwright. What
happens after infatuation graduation in
a relationship? “Bedroom Farce’s”
exploration of marriage produce such

serious questions.

’ The set of the play adds to its intelli-
gence; Costa explains that the framing
of the story will hopefully be captured

of humor to be found (situational awk- .

in the design—the three rooms, perched next
to each other, are literally framed. This, she
says, puts the picture “‘a little bit askew.” It
captures the “fact that this is a real world, but
it also has these moments that are in the bor-
derline of farce.”

This borderline creates a careful balance
of entertainment and intelligence. In addition
to the thought-provoking production’s intro-
duction of eccentric characters getting them-
selves into comical situations, it is all
adorned in the mid-70s fashion of Britain.

What more is there to ask for?
