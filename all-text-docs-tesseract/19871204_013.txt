If you buy an IBM Personal System/2” Model 25 by
the end of this year, you'll not only get a substantial
student discount, we'll throw in a nifty extra.

A sturdy, metal footlocker with brass tim,
16” x16" x20"

The computer is a great way to keep on top of
your class work. It'll store lots of stuff you need to
remember. And the trunk is real handy for holding

most everything else.

It’s a neat idea that’s yours for peanuts.

To take advantage of this special deal, contact
your on-campus IBM Education Product
Coordinator. But don’t wait too long. This special
offer expires December 3lst.
