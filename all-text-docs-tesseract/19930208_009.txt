Cornelius for lunch at 1:00. If that
reality is offensive, I do not apolo-
gize. College students live in a
separate, phantasmal time zone.
11:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning
may as well be the crack of dawn.
AndaDCPC sermonentitled “You
and Your Aging Parent” is won-
derful and necessary for the more
middle-aged members of the con-
gregation, but forcollege students,
it’s no reason at all to get out of
bed. Despite this, a lot of us are
really searching within ourselves
for ways in which.to deal with the
questions of this life, questions that
are philosophical, emotional, and
spiritual in nature.

To address many of these is-
sues, I would love to see an ecu-
menical vespers service come into
existence. Beginning at 5:30 or
6:00 on Sunday evenings, the ser-
vice need not last more than half an
hour, and students could come
dressed in sweat-pants and ripped
T-shirts if they so desired. Most
importantly, students could come
into an environment prepared to
ruminate on questions that are of
the upmost importance to people
ages 18 to 22, questions like, what
exactly doI believe? or where am
I going from here? There’s aneed.

On Davidson:

Implicit in the ongoing 150
Million Capital Campaignisaplan
to push Davidson into the national
atenia of colleges and universities.

I’mall forit, so long as it is done in
a manner that serves to magnify
rather than erase all that is wonder-
ful and unique about Davidson.

I hope Davidson will:

1) never have more than 2,000
students.

2) never push professors to publish
at all costs.

3) never endorse a politically cor-
rect police state of words.

4) never allow students or faculty
elements to go unchecked when
they (a) make racial or gender inci-
dents out of non-discrimanatory
occurrences or (b) claim racial or
gender incidents are nothing when
they clearly are (prudent, non-re-
actionary observers know the dif-
ference).

5) never turn its back on its con-

tinuing commitment to embrace’

diversity in a manner that is posi-
tive for all ethnic groups.
6) never try to measure up to
schools with bigger names and
smaller hearts.

In a nutshell: “People think

‘they compliment us when the call

us the “Princeton of the South.” If
you want Princeton, you’ ll have to
go to New Jersey, dammit!”—
Former Professor CharlesE. Lloyd.

Not unlike a lot of seniors, I
view my time at Davidson with a
strange mixture of emotions. I

refuse to cheapen those sentiments

with sentimentality. A final col-
umn in which I might recount 4
years of Davidson, as if it were on
behalf of my class, seems a lot
more than presumptious. That’s

why I decided to end this column
the way it began, talking about the
desperate needs of a school al-
ready in the 99th percentile.

On a final note, I want to rec-
ognize the work Walter Price, Sa-
rah Gayle, Tom Koonce, and Tom
Price have done for the paper. Few
non-senior, non-faculty readers
understand how far the paper has
come in two years. Mark Puckett,
whom few of you would have
known, began the push to get the
newspaper going again. Before
that, the South’s Foremost College
Weekly was an atrocious quarterly
that read like the weather page
from USA TODAY. Walter Price
has done a great deal to improve
both the look and the content of the
paper, in 1990-91 as Associate

Editor, in 1991-92 as Executive’

Editor, and in 1992-93 as Editor-
in-Chief.

No, the paper’s not always
perfect, but a lot of the time, it’s
damn good. I say that despite my
association with the paper, despite
the fact that Walter is one of my
roommates and that Sarah, Tom,
and Tom are good friends of mine,
and despite the fact that people
continue to claim that the
Davidsonian isan elitistrag run by
the FOW’s (Friends of Walter, for
those of you in the know). To

those few, I plead, as many people | 1 esou

in these pages have, to come to the
Davidsonian meetings, get in-
volved, and make the paper even
better.

Rude Notes

the Dungeon by VAXites.) I am
not using hyperbole as a literary
device here, either. It really is
three feet thick. ;

Actually, it’s got some useful
stuff on it. Next time you Check
Chal, Viwe Vax. (I like that, “View
Vax.”)

Then, I wonder, How many
committees are there on this cam-
pus. I know the Union itself has at
least fifteen; the SGA formsacom-~
mittee to go to the bathroom; and
the administration forms a com-
mittee at the drop of the proverbial
hat.

When in doubt, form a com-
mittee. (Walter Price, our distin-
guished, soon to be ex, editor-in-
chief.)

Now here’s something that
really shocked me. The brothers of
Spee, I mean Sigma Phi Epsilon,
did something wrong. To quote
one of the TV stations, “They tied
him up and dropped him on his
head.” Now, I’m nottrying to pick
on them here, but I thought the

KAs and the SAEs were the bad
guys on campus. I thought it was
the Kappa Sigs and the Sig Eps
who kept up the image that frater-
nities were created to mold men’s
souls, not there drinking habits.

Screw it, let’s throw ‘em all
off campus. (That is hyperbole.)

Raise your hand if you’re tired
of looking at junior girls. I mean,
if you’re tired of looking at some
junior girl or guy’s pictures from
their absolutely wonderful trip
abroad that you should have gone
on. I mean, it was the greatest time
of my life, I’d go back there. as
soon as possible. Imean Davidson
has changed, and I know it’s hard
for you to understand this, but it’s
weird coming back when every-
thing has changed so much and
there’s all these new freshmen and
all, I mean, I’d go right back right
now, if I could.

Yeah, I’m tiredofhearing that,
toon:

Plus, I have another question.
Don’t you wish you werea pledge?
Me neither.

Why doesn’t your laundry just
get up and wash itself? (Actually,

mine might.) I mean this i is when
I feel like I nced a maid? 6r at least
a wife. I simply don’t have the
patience to get up and carry my
laundry down to Watts and throw
itinto the machines. Hell, I’m too
lazy to even buy detergent. (Sure,
I could just take it too the Laundry,
but I want to do it myself, which
means it doesn’t get done.)

Anyway, it’s been fun doing
this for the last year and a half and
I hope you’ve enjoyed reading
some of these articles. (God, thisis
emotional.) Thank Walter Price
for doing a wonderful job as edi-
tor-in-chief, if you get a chance.
And thank Sarah Gayle for show-
ing him how to do it, too.

P.S. Have you noticed how
many swear words you can sneak
into printnow. Youcan bitch, get
pissed off, screw off, bite me. Hell,
you can say just about anything.
(Just one last little bit of cheep
humor there. Actually, I wouldn’t
call it humor, maybe cheep obnox-
iousness, but not humor.)

See ya. (The wife thing was a
joke.)

licemen were people before they
became policemen. But what
makes you think that if they were
racist people before, that they are
not now? There is not much of a
change. The only change is that
now, they are racist people with

occupations.

So, how could they have ar-
rived at that verdict? In my opin-
ion, very easily. America is a

racist society where, for the most
part, unless you are a “white,
Anglo-Saxon, Protestant male” you
are not worth anything. The
Rodney King incident was not the
first'incident to prove that there is
no justice for African- Americans;
it was just the first to receive that
muchattention. This may be news
to the majority, but to minorities
this is a reality that occurs a little
bit more than desired.

Indeed, the majority willnever
know whatit feels like to walk into

astore and have people follow you
because they associate your color
to something negative, like steal-
ing. Some will never know whatit
feels like to have a professor look
at you like youdon’tbelong. Yes,
many won’tknow whatit feels like
when you have to prove yourself,
work twice as hard and come out
with much less. The sad truth is
that wherever African-Americans
go, they are always treatedas guilty
before proven innocent. Shouldn’t
it be the other way around?

write it on the wall of arestaurant,
Ido not know. But it does present
a point of view which I hope many
of you take to heart. .

We shouldn’t worry so much
about our grades and resumes as
longaswelearn to think, Ofcourse,
there is no harm in preparing for a
line of work by majoring in sub-
jects like biology or economics,
but don’t do it unless you like it;

) you'll just like it less later. Be-
sides, many people don’t find their

talents until after college. My
roommate’s father majored in
arcospace enginccring and is now
a tee-shirt designer.

So enjoy your years of frce-
dom, open your minds, experiment,
and don’t bog yourselves down
too early. And read the writing on
the wall. Sometimes you find wis-
dom where you don’t expect it.
