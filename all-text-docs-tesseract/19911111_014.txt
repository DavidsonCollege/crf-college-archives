Cagers Whip Cherry Point in First Exhibition Test

By Bruce Balestier

The Davidson basketball team
began their 1991-92 season in
earnest Saturday night with a 100-
64 thrashing of the post team from
Cherry Point Marine Air Station.
The Wildcats took a 55-33 halftime
lead in the exhibition and then
coasted to the win. Sophomore
swingman Janko Narat paced the

team with 19 points.

After some early hot shooting
by Cherry Point, Davidson gradu-
ally pulled away, using a defense
that denied every pass to provoke
numerous turnovers. A Davidson
offense predicated on constant
cutting and frequent ball reversal
translated into open shots on the
other end. The ‘Cats also benefit-

ted from 22 fast break points.
The bulk of the scoring Satur-
day came from the 3 spot, where
the Wildcats received Narat’s 19
points and another 15 from Scott
Alford. Alford shot a blistering 7-
9 (including 1-1 from 3-point
range) on the night. Center Detlef
Musch shot poorly, but scored 13
points, overcoming a minor knee

Club Lacrosse Defeats UNC-G
During Only Home Appearance

By Jack Handey

The Davidson Club Lacrosse
Team beat the UNC-Greensboro
team last Sunday 7-5 to pick up a
win its first game of the fall. The
Wildcats have been practicing all
fall under the leadership of player/
coach Phil Degnan.

The Wildcats started fast build-
ing up a 6-1 lead at the half. The
veteran players led the charge, with
attack Phil Degnan scoring two
goals. Senior midfielders Dean
Vanderwarker and Robbie Huber
also put in goals to stretch the
Wildcat lead.

The story of the game, how-
ever, was not the performance of
the seniors, but the input of the

large number of newcomers to the
team. Freshman attack Smith
Maddrey contributed two goals.
John Walsh, Brian Parrish and
Brian Bentley all had good per-
formances in their very first la-
crosse games. Degnan emphasized
the teaching nature of the club for
allowing the newcomers to makea
contribution.

Another outstanding perform-
ance was turned in by Cordell
Jones, who stepped into the line-
upas the goalkeeper with no previ-
ous experience. Degnan was very

pleased with Jones’ showing, —

which allowed Degnan to step out
of the goal and into the offense.

Hockey Repeats as
Deep South Champs

By Jennifer Roos

On August fifteenth the hockey
team declared its first and fore-
most goal of the season: another
Deep South championship. AlI-
most three months later on No-
vember third, this goal wasaccom-
plished as Davidson won its sec-
ond consecutive Deep South
Championship, defeating Catawba
3-0 in Salisbury last weekend.

The Wildcats were the number

one seed and advanced unscathed

through the winner’s bracket of
the double elimination tournament.
Their first opponent were the
Mountaineers from Appalachian
State. The Wildcats pounced on
them from the opening whistle.
Junior Monique Dockter
scored twenty minutes into the
game and Davidson never looked

back. Minutes later Dockter scored —

her second goal of the game and
was inches away from a hat trick.
Senior Mary Russ scored the third
goal of the game right before
halftime. ASU struggled through-
out the game to maintain any type
of momentum on offense.

The Wildcats wereheld score-
less in the second half yet still out-
shot ASU. With this victory be-
hind them Davidson started to fo-

.cus on their next opponent, Wake
Forest, the defending Deep South
runner-up. Davidson had
previously beaten Wake in a sud-
den death overtime in regular sea-
son play. This game would send
Wake or Davidson to the loser’s
bracket. :

' Wake Forest opened the game .

up with a strong offensive surge
and the Wildcats were forced to
play very defensively. TheWild-
cats were assessed a penalty stroke
for supposedly pushing a Wake
Forest player to the ground while
in the circle.

Sophomore Emily Coleman
rose to the challenge and with au-
thority stopped Wake cold. This
would be Wake Forest’s best scor-
ing opportunity. of the day. This

“strong defensive play lit a fuse

under the Wildcats because they
proceeded to take control of the
game.

The game was scoreless until
the last two minutes of the game
when Dockter slammed in a goal,
her third of the tournament, on an

assist by freshman Missy Potts. It —

was a perfect ending for the Wild-
cats. This victory propelled
Davidson to the finals of the tour-
namenton Sunday, and they would
face the winner of the loser’s
bracket, Catawba or Wake Forest.
That game was played imme-
diately after Davidson’s game.
Davidson faced Catawba in the
finals. Catawba had beaten
Davidson on this field earlier in the
season by a 1-0 margin, yet
Davidson beat the Indians on
Homecoming Weekend in the
revenge game handily 4-1. That
victory ensured the Wildcats of
their number one seed,
Davidson's game plan in the
finals was to score first and play
offensively right from the start.
They did just that. Potts scored the
first goal with twenty minutes into

Plaisance, the leading scorer on

fense, aided by Jay Spiegel and
Jim Livingston. The strong play
of the defenders kept pressure
off the inexperienced Jones in
goal. Attack Hayler Osborne
also put in a goal to round out
Davidson’s scoring.

UNC-G played a very
physical game, as Trey Rust
found out the hard way.
Davidson, however, took UNC-
G out of its game. Davidson
played with much poise for the
first Outing of the season, suf-
fering only three penalties.

Davidson will complete its
fall season with games against
club teams from Augusta and
Charleston this Saturday and
Sunday.

the first half. All hopes of
Catawba winning Deep South
were thwarted. Junior Simone

the team, scored the second goal
ofthe game. Dockter scored off
a comer right before halftime,
yet it was called back by acon-
troversial offside call.

A minute into the second half,
Russ scored her second goal of
the tournament. The score was
3-0 with Davidson in complete
control of the game. Catawba

offensive drive, yet the inde-
fatigable defense, which was
not scored upon through the
entire tournament, staved off
the Indians’ drive.

This victory was especially -
sweet for the four seniors: Fran
Fierro, Lauren Follmer, Beth
Pharr and Mary Russ. Their .
freshman year the hockey pro-
gram had arecord of 6-7-1.
Since their freshman year,
they have gone35- 13-5 and
have earned two Deep
South Championships tro-
phies. They have seen the
program grow tremen-
dously and were key con- -
tributors in the success of
the hockey program.

Their on and off the
field leadership and play-
ing abilities will be greatly
missed.

The fiverising Juniors
willhavea tough task ahead
of them in attempting to fill

injury in the process. Senior cap-
tain Paul Denmond scored just 2
points, but doled out 7 assists.
Starting guards Pat Holloway and
Jason Zimmerman each had 9
points.

merman and Holloway, Musch at
