Vice President for Academic
Affairs T.C. Price Zimmermann
has been climbing mountains
and surmounting administra-
tive obstacles all his life. As
usual, he is planning another
string of alpine excursions for
the summer. This summer,
however, he is not going alone.

Price Zimmermann is married
and is taking his wife.

Zimmermann first met Mar-
garet during his assault on The
Matterhorn in Disneyland last
summer. She was operating the
bobsleds when he suddenly
became tangled in his Swiss
seat. ‘“‘I wasn’t really stuck,’’ he
said, ‘‘but I found her aesthet-
ically pleasing, so I let her
untangle my crampons and
loosen by bow tie.”

Zimmermann later brought
Margaret to Davidson, where
they climbed water towers and
spent several evenings exam-
ining his medievel print collec-
tion. Zimmeramnn was impres-
sed by her ‘‘well-rounded aca-
demic outlook,”’ her ‘‘four terms
of French” and her P.E. Mount-
aineering credits. It was love at
first rappel.

Zimmermann knew Margaret
was the one when he showed her
around his Chambers office
chateau. Not only did she
appreciate his stuffed yellow-
bellied marmoset from Nepal,
but ‘‘she was the only woman I
ever met who liked the pop
tart!”’ he said.

The two decided to “tie the

Everyone held his breath as Price and Margaret plummeted to their wedding ceremony on
CPC’s steeple last March 15. As his bride floated toward him, Price donned academic robes
and recited his vows in German, Latin, Greek, and Chinesé. “TCPZ’s always had such a flair for
ceremonies, ” Ava Spencer noted later.

bowline’’ in March and said

their vows above an admiring
crowd on the DCPC steeple.

After a relatively routine
honeymoon in Tahiti, Zimmer-
mann took off alone for the
Sierra Nevadas during spring
break. But thinking of Mar-
garet while ‘‘chimneying”’ caus-
ed him a number of painful
accidental ‘‘finger jams.”

decided to take Margaret
mountaineering with him this
summer. Margaret originally
wanted to learn by climbing
Space Mountain in’ Disney
World but Zimmermann objec-
ted. ‘‘I don’t like Florida,’’ he
said. ‘It lacks class, it’s too hot
and it’s bad for my sinuses.”

Zimmermann plans to seek
out ‘‘Cleaner air’ by teaching
his wife to climb ivory towers in
Massachusetts. ‘“‘They’rg cov-
ered with ivy,’ he said, “but
the extra challenge will be good
for her. She has a lot of learning
to do and I’m the one to teach
her.”’

Asked if they were planning
on children, Zimmermann said,
“I detest the little tykes.
They’re fiscally imprudent and
they’d soil the Persian rugs.”
Margaret disagreed saying that
hearing the patter of little tcpz’s
around the house would be
“really swell.’

The couple has decided to
shelve the child proposal in-
definitely, in order to avoid
putting any “pinch grips” on
their marriage. _
