The Point

THE LAST WORD

AFTER SCROUNGING through the bowels of
Johnston Gym for the past year, it is with mixed emo-
tions that this column realizes it has run for the last
time.

z

After

And while the year now ending has seen many
varied events, the biggest topic of the year reached a
passionate peak Tuesday night as Homer Smith and
Lefty Driesell took on and put down all comers in a
forum which should have been held many months ago.

Fielding questions like Bobby Richardson fielded
grounders, Lefty showed his tremendous speaking abil-
ity mixing corn pone with figures while straight-man
Smith quietly showed that he is the toughest obstacle
foes of subsidized athletics will face as Jong as he is

ere.

* s

WHEN CONSIDERING the question one should
consider the possible outcomes of proposed changes.
Assume Davidson freezes the value of all expenses and
the question comes down to a question of whether ath-
letic scholarships can be covered by gate receipts above
those normally attending a game no matter what the
caliber of the competition may be. Even if one sub-
tracts an arbitrary part of scholarship money which
athletes would receive if they matriculated here, it is
doubtful if gate receipts can ever make subsidized ath-
letics a profit-making venture. .

¢ *

AND SO THE QUESTION: Is the money spent
bringing in students who probably would not have come
here worth the extra money spent on athletics? Con-
sider the publicity and recruiting which the Athletic
Department has contributed to the college’s attempts
to attract the best students here. We all think that one
of the letters to a prospect speaks only of the Top 10
teams or of beautiful Richardson Field, but that is all
wrong. Those of us who have seen correspondence from
Homer Smith to high school prospects can attest to its
effectiveness. With an admissions office which is so
thin that you can count the representatives on your
thumbs, any organized plan spreading the gospel has
to be a major contribution.

Therefore Davidson football and basketball have
contributed to the college through actions which are
not dependent on fancy similes and a publicist. If Da-
vidson ever needed envoys, it needs them now and stu-
dents and coaches are filling the void.

As for the students brought here by athletic schol-
arships, they cannot be lumped into a category of guys
who have 2.7 averages and are All-American boys. Each
of them may be a student paid on the basis other than
academic promise, but they take the courses you take
and live with you, giving you an insight into an area
of experiences which would never be available to Da-
vidson students.

- Therefore one can say that Davidson athletics con-
tribute to the intellectual atmosphere of the college
community because they widen the knowledge of many
Students, not just athletes.

s

THE STUDENTS on athletic grants do not stand ©.
out as professional athletes. They are students just like .,

us, only a lot more co-ordinated. And then there are
the players who come here after being recruited by the
coaches but with no aid promised. How anyone can
infer that the recognition which Homer Smith and
Lefty Driesell have presented has been harmful. except
on the latter’s television show recently, is difficult to
understand. Advertisers always rely on more than one
media and in the same sense, Davidson relies on differ-
ent means to achieve the same purpose: make the col-
lege attractive to high school students who show prom-
ise in academic fields.

It may not be morally riglit to give a full scholar-
Ship to a student because he is a good football player,
but there are other situations which do more harm
than good to the college. Football and basketball
grants-in-aid are not among them. They have contrib-
uted to the overall growth and prestige of the college
and are thus important parts of the college’s program.

The discussions may die down for a while but they
will flame again. But this fact remains clear: at the
moment, the trustee policy of providing grants-in-aid
for athletes who qualify as students is tailored to fit
the needs of the college and unti! a feasible alternative
presents itself, this is the best system for the college.

* *

HOMER replied to a question Tuesday night with
a statement that Davidson is unique in its attempts to
combine an excellent liberal arts education with a pro-
gressive program of athletics. One does not have to be
like .... Being unique is a challenge to Davidson Col-
lege. Let us hope it will continue to accept the chal-
enge.

Sailors Swamp
Yacht Club, 3-1

By CHIP. ROBERTSON

Defending the Lake Norman
Warm-Up Cup, they captured
from Lake Norman Yacht Club
last year, Davidson's sailors
went to local Lake Norman
Yacht Club last Saturday for the
second annual Warm-Up Regat-
ta and defeated the clubbers,
3-1.

It was cold and the winds
were light, but the Wildcats were
hot. as they showed immediate-
ly by taking a dominant posi-
tion at the start and maintain-
ing it all the way through the
first race.

It was only by a lucky wind
shift on the last leg that a LN-
YC boat was able to challenge
Davidson's two front running
boats and slip into second place
at the finish.

Davidson's Chip Robertson and
Chip Bellamy took first place.
followed by LNYC’s Jack Mce-
Neary, Tom Kirtley of Davidson
and Tad Lowdermilk; LNYC’s
Bob Orr (a 1965 graduate of the
Davidson team. sailing against
for the first time): Ben Reeves
and Bob Albee. both of David-
son: and LNYC’s Jim Owens.

The second race featured an-
other radical wind shift on the
first weather leg which LNYC,
with their greater local experi-
ence, played correctly. When one
Davidson boat fouled out at the
weather mark. LNYC marched
to an easy 1-2-4 win. The ‘Cats
had dominated the start, all
three Davidson boats crossing
ahead of the Lake Norman
Yacht Club fleet. But all the Da-
vidson boats missed the right
tack for the wind shift.

vidson bounced back from the

Davidson's varsity cindermen,

scored a double victory over
Wofford College and High Point
College here last Saturday. The
‘Cats ‘scored 70 points to 68
for High Point and 43 for Wof-
ford.

Cox scored 2034 points before
suffering a clean shoulder sep-
aration while running the 330-
yard intermediate hurdles. The
school record of 25 points for a
single meet is held by Heath
Whittle and was set in 1929
against Wake Forest.

Clubmen Fall To UNC
For Year’s First Loss

The Wildcat clubmen suffered

each contributed a half point to

their first defeat of the season
Monday, 16%-4%, at the hands
of UNC on the winners’ course.

‘Everyone did pretty well con-
sidering the conditions,’ said
Coach Tom Scott.

A stiff breeze and 40 degree
weather hampered the match as
the ’Cats faced a strong Caro-
lina team competing on their
practice course.

Mike Spann warmed things up
with a scorching one under par
71 to register the only individual
victory, 3-0, over David Robin-
son. Spann’s round earned him
a three-way tie with Steve Rob-
bins and David Owens of Caro-
lina for match medalist honors.

Johnny Giles, Bruce Vander-
bloemen, and George Leight

complete the scoring. It was
the ‘Cats first loss against three
victories.

The team will leave Saturday
for a week of links competition
at the Cape Coral Holiday Tour-
nament in Cape Coral, Fla.
“The competition will be keen,”
said Scott. “It’s nearly compar-
able to the NCAA tournament.”

Twenty schools, including
Duke, Princeton, Purdue, and
LSU, will vie for positions.

Although shooting for an up-
per half standing, Scott pointed
out that the ‘Cats’ main objec-
tive in the tournament is to gain
experience. “It will be good
spring training,"’ he said. ‘The
tournament will help everyone
get his game sharpened up.”

Team captain Joe Jelks, who
played at Cape Coral last year.
described the Cape Coral greens
and fairways as ‘‘a real fine
course,"’ but added that a gusty
morning wind would probably
be a big factor.

“I believe Cox can easily
break this record.’’ Whittle said.
“He has six events that he can
do well, When he separated his
shoulder. he was winning the
hurdles and would probably have
finished first. He had taken only
one of his jumps in the triple
jump and has bettered the win-
ning mark in practices.

“‘We are confident that he will
be able to return before the
next dual meet.”

Bill Randolph won the shot
put with a throw of 43° 8°’, and
Roane Cross finished third. Bill
Bryan took first place in the
discus with a 132’ 11" throw.
Cox finished first in the broad
jumm’ with a 22’ 6" effort, sec-
ond in the high jump. and third
in the triple jump.

In other field events, Kerry
Keith finished third in the jave-
lin, and Bill Blackstone took
fourth in the pole vault.

Cox won the 100-yard dash
with a time of 10.2 seconds. Tom
Caldwell finished third in both
tthe 100 and 220-yard dashes.
