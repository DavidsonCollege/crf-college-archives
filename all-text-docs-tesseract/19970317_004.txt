Juniors trying to bring
sororities to campus

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Staff Writer

Inspired by the example re-
cently set at Princeton University,
preliminary discussions have be-

gun concerning the possibility of -

bringing sororities to the Davidson
campus.

Spearheading the group inves-
tigating this potential new social
outlet for women are juniors Chris-
tina Rodriguez and Bonner Mead.

Both women, who are mem-
bers of Rusk eating house, empha-
size that their plans are only in an
initial stage.

“We first approached eating
house board members, and have
subsequently spoken at house meet-

Jingswiththaintentionalagceading
the word about what our hopes are,”
says Mead.

To determine the level of sup-
port for their endeavor, Rodriguez
and Mead recently circulated a sur-
vey within Patterson Court eating
houses, attached to their mission
statement.

The benefits these project lead-
ers envision are: greater social inti-
macy, closer bonds of friendship,
and the gaining of national affilia-
tions which will facilitate post-
graduate networking.

Proponents of the establish-
ment of sororities at Davidson say
they in no way wish to enter acom-
petition with eating houses.

“Eating houses will remain the
dominant women’s social center on
campus” says Mead.

“Sororities will be low-key
social alternatives that will serve a
function which closely parallels that
of fraternities on campus.”

Rodriguez and Mead say they

anticipate no barrier to a woman

holding membership jointly in a

sorority and a Patterson Court eat-
. Ing house.

Essential to the sorority estab-
lishment project’s growth is ap-
proval from the Patterson Court
Council, says PCC Advisor Beth
Searcy.

“The project must include at
least forty members who would first
approach the PCC for approval, and
next await the decision of the col-
lege president with regard to the
practicality of bringing a sorority to
campus,” says Searcy.

Patterson Court Council Presi-
dent Hallie Pitkin says the collec-
tive body of supporters for sorori-
ties on campus has so far gained no
official recognition. | Were
Rodriguez and Mead to bring their
proposal before the PCC, as is their
stated intention, Pitkin says the
Greek council would most likely
table the matter for further discus-
sion.

“The PCC’s voice could really
only extend so far as to say “We
support your desire to have another
social option,’” says Pitkin. Accord-
ing to Pitkin, the technical steps
involved in bringing a sorority to
campus are quite daunting.

“Ultimately,” says Pitkin, “‘so-
rorities are rather limited in their
operation. Their tight alcohol re-
Strictions must also be taken into
consideration.”

“There are opportunities and

challenges involved with having so-
rorities,” says Beth Searcy,
Patterson Court Advisor.
“Right now, though the project lead-
ers are still only in the information
gathering stage, I must say they
seem very ambitious.”

Dorm reconstruction and

Internet access are imminent

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL
Staff Writer

Just in time for Davidson’s
annual housing lottery, big changes
are coming to several dorms. “Irwin,
Knox, and Akers hopefully will be
ready for [Internet] connection
[next] week, if residents so desire,”
says Residential Networking Su-
pervisor John Reuning.

Sentelle dorm will be next in
line for Internet wiring, according
to Reuning. “Over the summer
Sentelle will be completely remod-
eled,” he says. “At that time they’Il
go through, rewire and put data
jacks in.” Kurt Holmes, Director of
Residence Life (RLO), says RLO
will spend about one million dollars
in projects this summer, with nearly
half that amount devoted to im-
proving Sentelle dorm.

“The construction won’t
change the shape of the rooms [in
Sentelle],” says Holmes. “Most
changes will be cosmetic.” Re-
modeling efforts will include in-
stallation of new draft-free windows
and electrical rewiring which will

provide independent 20 amp cir-
cuits for each room. Holmes says
that by the summer’s end, “we will
have about quadrupled the power
going into the building.”

Atacost of $70,000, Sentelle’s
window ee project is ex-

it is trying to solve. An all-or-noth-
ing policy should be adopted if this
is how we will continue.”

Sapp responded, “It is not pit-
ting the two against each other. An
all-or-nothing policy would risk
loosing Martin Luther King Day.
Both holidays would allow two sig-
nificant groups [civil rights sup-
porters and veteran’s supporters] to
get the recognition they deserve...
Presenting Veteran’s day alone
would be an incomplete argument.”

Other senators had problems

pected to make the building more —

energy-efficient and improve the
performance of the building’s heat-
ing and air conditioning units. Fi-
nally, all of the building’s sinks and
the lights above the sinks will be
replaced, and Sentelle has been the
designated recipient of new mat-
tresses by next fall.

RLO’s summer plans also in-
clude installation of a $45,000 air
conditioning unit in Richardson
dorm, replastering and repainting
Little dorm, purchasing new furni-
ture for some dorms down the hill,

just with the nature of the resolu-
tion. Independent senator Matt
Hobbie says, “[We] should not sus-
pend class. [Having] speakers are
enough to experience the holiday.
Semesters and classes are getting
shorter while tuition is going up.”
Kappa Sigma senator Connor
Eldridge says, “If we had (to recog-
nize the holiday) by extending class
one day into the summer, [the stu-
dents] who signed the petition would
have thought quite differently.”
Still, the SGA did come to a
vote when the amendments refer-

and increasing the number of lofts
available in dorm rooms, says
Holmes. “The rest of the summer’s
work will be divided among 100
little projects,” he adds.

RLO’s construction plans for
Sentelle dorm make it the only cer-
tain candidate for residence hall re-
wiring this summer. Reuning says |
he hopes Belk dorm will be rewired
for Internet access this summer as
well, but the residence hall net-
working schedule depends on the
availability of dorms during cam-
pus summer programs.

The resolution was adopted by the
SGA ona 18-10 margin. There were
four abstentions. Five senators had
left the meeting before the vote could
be taken. i

When the resolution came to

the 1999-2000 school year calen-
dar, it was unanimously rejected.
