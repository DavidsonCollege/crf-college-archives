WILDKITTENS AND CLEMSON
SCRUBS TIE HERE 7-7.

The Wildkittens brought the 1921 |

football campaign to a fitting close}
by outfighting and’ outplaying the)
Clemson Reserves in a hot and in-|
teresting game last Saturday. ' The}
count was 7-7 when Meb Long end-
ed the fracas, an appropriate finale |
to a season of more than the usual |
number of deadlocks. The showing |
of the “All-Americans” seemed to
please Coach Grey, who with the
student body saw the Kittens in
action for the first time. The Kit-
tens convinced one and all that there
will be no dearth of Varsity material
next year.

Doped to lose, the lighter Presby-
terians upset all prophecies in a man-
ner that has become a habit with
Davidson teams this year. Although
the field was muddy the backfields
managed to keep their fegt well and
tc gain consistently. Crawford’s
tossing of the wet sphereoid was
only equaled in its accuracy by the
skill of Hendrix _and_ Richards in
hagging the spirals. De Armon and
Crawford demonstrated that they
have an abundance of drive and Mc-
Allister’s work in backing up the
line was little short of superb.

Clemson’s touchdown came after
a sweeping end run by the lightning
fast Turnipseed, and indeed this is
the only way in which they could
hope to tally. For the Kitten for-
ward line knew their jelly and sure
strutted it. Within their 10-yard
border they often threw for losses
the powerful Emanual who starred
against Centre and threw a score in-
to Georgia Teck by scoring a touch-
down on a line play.

Davidson’s score came on the first
play of the second quarter. Regen’s
long arms got in the way of a puft
and a series of line plays soon car-
ried the ball to the 3-yard line, from
which McAllister squeezed his way
through center for a touchdown.
Captain Richards accomodated by
hooting goal.

The short fourth period although
devoid of scoring proved to be the
most interesting of the game. Early
in this frame Zeigler blocked a punt
and recovered on Davidson’s 16-yard
line. A pass gave Clemson first
down on the 5-yard mark. Four liné
plays produced but. four yards and
the ball changed hands. Not satis?
fied with this for a thrill; Turnipseed
started another by fumbling Regen’s
punt, Richards recovering. Hendrix
ticked off 14 and 20 yards on two
sallies around end, and the Kittens
soon had the ball on the 2-yard
mark, But Clemson held and they
failed to score.

Turnipseed and Emanual proved
to be the two best ground gainers
for Clemson, while Harvey and
Vinekley played the. best games in
the visitor’s line.

Furman’s 20-yard line,

Second Quarter.
McManaway gained 20 yards on

exchange of punts and it was
Furman’s ball on her 41-yard line.
Rhame’s 18-yard run and a trick for-
ward pass good for 25 yards soon
resulted in another touchdown, The
and they
showed up well. In the short time
remaining they advanced the
skin to Furman’s 20-yard line only
to lose the ball on downs. McMan-
away punted out of danger as the
half ended.

Third Quarter.

Davidson received and drove well
into Furntin’s territory. McMan-
away intercepted a pass and punted
to the Wildcats’ 30-yard line. An-
other spurt again carried the ball to
midfield, and McFadden, forced to
punt, dropped a beauty on Furman’s
6-yard me. The Hurricane then
workedAts way 94 yards for a touch-
down,/| The Davidson line fought
gamely under their ‘goal-posts but
Waters scored on fourth down, Dav-
idson again received_and_returned-to
midfield where Rhame intercepted a
pass just before the quarter ended.

Fourth Quarter.

Furman’s sustained march of 54
yards produced another touchdown
and McLeod kicked his fourth goal.
The scrub backfield) went in and
again received the kick-off. They
seriously threatened the Purple goal
line, planting the ball on the 5-yard
line. Just when a touchdown look-
ed certain Rip Major set them back
five yards for being offsiders. Un-
daunted they again drove the ball to
the 4-yard mark. On fourth down a
pass to Schenck was made and Fur-
man took the ball on her 20-yard
line. McManaway’s punt went over
Long’s head and the ball rolled to
the 26-yard line. Passes brought
the ball to Furman’s 30-yard line,
anda punt gave the oval to the Bap-
lists on their 3-yard mark. Long
fumbled a punt and Furman recover-
ed only to punt again just as the
game ended.

‘SPECIAL TRAIN CARRIED "
SUPPORTERS TO FURMAN

Thanksgiving morning bright and

early the student body was awaken-
ied by the ringing of the bell. indi-
cating that it was high time to get
ready to make the trip to Green-
ville for the Furman game, via the
| special train,
The sun was just beginning to
|make its appearance in the eastern
skies when the boys began to!
‘tush for the station after hear-
ing the whistle of the monster
}engine which was to carry
jthem to THE GAME of the sea-
json. Stopping at thg little store on
jthe corner for a cup of coffee, a
jsandwich, ete, they continued their
jway and found seats in the cars
which were waiting.

Promptly at seven, the special be-
gan moving in the direction of Char- |
lette, but?as many of the boys were
seen sprinting across the campus it
was decided to wait a few minutes
for these tardy ones. At last we
were off!

It seemed scarcely a space of ten
{minutes or so until we had reached
the Queen City, where the train stop-
ped for a few minutes to. take on
more passengers from that point.
Then we were off again this time
speeding along the main line of the’
jSouthern towards our goal. We
halted a few minutes only at Gas-
tonia,, taking on a few passengers
ifrom that point.
| The time was spent by those on
jboard in many and varied ways.’
Some chose to harmonize, whereas
some played “set back” ete., others
of the studious class chose to study,
jand the remainder followed the band
jto the rear car where is played al-
most without stopping from Char-
lotte to Greenville.

Arriving in Spartanburg, it was
necessary for the special to wait for
a short,period of time. Cheer Lead-
er Story promptly mounted — the!
engine, and all of the Wildcat sup-
porters gathered around him and un-
der his leadership yelled their heads
off almost for their team, not for-
getting in their enthusiasm, how-
ever, to give three “Hi-s” for Spar-
tanburg. After the yelling came
the singing of O! Davidson. Then
some of the thoughtful ones found
some chalk and = marked up the
coaches so that all outsiders would
know of the “Wildeat Special.”

When the train reached Green-
ville, a rush was made to get tickets
to the game, then everyone hurried
