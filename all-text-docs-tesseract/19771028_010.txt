The Fall Major Drama Production,
Shakespeare's As You Like It pro-
vides an evening of enjoyable, if less
than profound, theatre.

Although the play itself, being one
of the playwright’s less polished, does
not offer stimulating material, the
cast, under the direction of Professor
of Drama and Speech Rupert T.
Barber, presents a plausible rendi-
tion.

Bad diction, slow pace, and poorly
timed lighting along with the diffi-
culty of Shakespearean language mar
the first act.

Chuck Still presents an Orlando
with a Tennessee accent, difficult to
understand, and hardly appropriate.
However, the lines are delivered
accurately and, if one divorces oneself
from this minor drawback, his charac-
ter comes across well.

The first act suffers considerably
from slow pacing. Perhaps this is due
to the audience’s unfamiliarity with
Shakespearean dialogue, perhaps the
fault lies in the play itself. One is
pleased, however, to return from the
first intermission to a much improved
flow of action. The second and third
acts more than compensate for the
initial wait,

Second, third acts
rejuvenate comedy

Act One disappears as the cast,
Professor of Drama and Speech
Joseph Gardner’s imaginative set and
Shakespeare’s magic enchant you into
a wood in which live the most
entertaining characters of the play:
the ousted Duke and his band.

During these Acts most players
show their virtuosity, from Tom
Besselieu as the Duke Senior to Ann
Burke, as the shepardess, Phebe.
Their warmth comes across quite
well.

Margaret (Jake) Darby’s Gane-
mede comes across more realistically
than her Rosalind because she plays
the female role a little too brashly. As
a man, however, she does well.

Andrea Murphy’s Celia has all the:

charm and innocence a sheltered
spoiled youth needed for the part,
while Brad Christie presents a Jac-
ques with spark, sass and wit. They
are to be commended.

Unfortunately the cast could not
keep up its vitality to the end of their
presentation, as the marriage scene, a
mass gathering of all members of the
cast, lacked the excitement and
spectacle of a happy ending. It is,
nevertheless, blessed with some very
funny lines.

“As You Like It’’ leaves one a little
baffled, a little let down, but, in
retrospect, pleased.

If Shakespeare’s purpose was to
confuse the audience with the play, he
succeeded. But it is very enjoyable
confusion.

What’s it like having a brother or
sister on campus? Most everyone has
wondered at one time or another, and
here are the thoughts of ten people
who know.

Sophomore Anne Eglin and her
sister Susan are happy to be at the
same school. Anne worked hard to get
Susan interested in Davidson, and
she won. ‘I was not at all open-min-
ded; I wanted her here.”

Susan is happy with her decision.
She feels closer to her sister. ‘“‘We now
have different friends which gives us a
lot more to talk about and less to
argue, which I think makes us
closer.”

Anne and Susan usually see each
other at least once a day but seldom
for any length of time. They would
like to do more together, but they are
hesitant about being together too
often. ‘‘Right now, we are at a peak
and are getting along very well, but
I’m afraid we could get too much of
each other,’’ Anne said.

Susan agrees. ‘‘At home, we did too
much together. This way we are more
free, and it’s much easier.’’

Asked whether they could ever
room together, they replied, ‘‘That
would be like the kiss of death.”’

Quite different from Anne and
Susan are freshmen twin brothers
David and Hayne Neisler. For them,
Davidson College is a family tradi-
tion. Their father, grandfather, and
uncles all attended Davidson. Their
older brother Parks is a junior here
now, and their cousin Liz ison JYA in
France.

They seldom see Parks, ‘‘But he did

help us choose our courses,” David
said.

David and Hayne share the same
dorm room on 4th Watts, and they
have had little trouble adjusting to
college life. ‘‘After all, we shared the
same room at home for eighteen
years.”

In addition to being roomates, they
are taking the same courses. Asked
whether their professors could tell
them apart, Hayne said, “Yeah, they
just ask for David or Hayne Neisler
and one of us answers.” ‘“‘We’re used
to people messing up, though,”’
replied David, ‘‘so if I’m walking
down the hall and someone calls me
Hayne, I always turn around.”

In the spring, David and Parks
hope to join Hayne on the Davidson
golf team.

Two more brothers on campus,
senior Dave Tinkler and freshman
Stuart do not see each other often,
but they.are glad to know that the
other one is around. Stuart said, ‘‘If
David wasn’t here, I don’t think I
would be here. He has made it easier
to leave home and start college.”’

Dave is glad to have Stuart here.
‘‘He might see some value in my
opinions now. At first I was afraid
that Stuart’s presence might inhibit
me, but it hasn’t.”’

Stuart enjoys being identified with
Dave, but ‘it does get annoying only
being known as David Tinkler’s little
brother,’’ he said.

Sisters Jamie and Carolyn Watt
have a close relationship at Davidson.
They try to check up on each other
every day. ‘““This year we seem to see
more of each other,’’ said Jamie.

“Having each other here has been a
real help. We have been able to make
more acquaintances, and we can help
each other if we need each other,’’
Carolyn said.

Asked whether professors identify
them together, they said, yes. ‘‘Jam-
ie’s being just in front of me does have
some effect in class, but not too
much,”’ replied Carolyn.

They would like to do more things
together, but it is hard for them to
find the time. They think living
together would be awkward, but they
could do it.

“One of the best things about
having Carolyn here,’’ Jamie said, ‘‘is
that I can borrow her clothes, and one
of the most difficult things is sharing
a vehicle with her.”’

Will and Nancy Long have enjoyed
being at Davidson together. ‘‘We’ve
gotten to be better friends,’’ Nancy
said, “although we see each other less
this year, it’s good to know that he’s
around.”’

Will feels that he was lucky having
Nancy here his freshman year. ‘‘Be-
cause she was a hall counselor, lused
that as an excuse to visit the girls on
her hall.”’

Nancy and Will both enjoy bump-
ing into each other at parties. ‘‘After
all, somebody has to keep an eye on
Will,” she said.
