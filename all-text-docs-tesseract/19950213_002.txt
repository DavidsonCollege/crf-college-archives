Black History Month

February celebrates history and
solidarity with a multitude of events

If you ate at Vail Commons
on Wednesday, February | or saw
Glory at the Union on February 5
or 8, you have already become a
part of Davidson College’s month-
long celebration of black history
and culture.

The goal of Black History
Month is to supplement the com-
mon version of American history
by reminding whites and blacks
alike of the many, frequently-over-
looked contributions which Afri-
can-Americans have made to our
society. The whole school is in-
vited to attend this celebration,
which was planned in coordina-
tion with a number of different
student interest groups.

“Students should be chal-
lenged to go beyond their comfort
zone, to come and take advantage
of these activities,” says Assistant
Dean of Students John Eaves.
Eaves oversaw the planning of this
celebration, along with leaders
from BSC, SERCH, the College
Union, the Ethnic Studies Depart-
ment, the Dean Rusk program, the
Counseling Center, and the
Chaplain’s Office.

Starting on January 16 with
the recognition of Martin Luther
King, Jr.’s birthday, the Chaplain’s
Office organized a worship ser-
vice. Beginning on January 28th,
the.Dean Rusk program sponsored

Africa Week, a survey of African
art, food, music, and politics.

This weekend students had the
opportunity to enter into more con-
temporary black life. The Black
Greek Association from Winthrop
University performed “Steppin’
and Jammin’,” a collage of differ-
ent social dance routines, in the
900 Room Friday night. Sunday
night, Adilah Barnes performed “I
AMTHATIAM: Woman, Black,”
a one-woman play about the his-
torical contributions of .African-
American women. (See the Arts &
Living section for more details.)

More festivities are still to
come. William Raspberry, a col-
umnist with The Washington Post,
will lecture on February 16. The
Sons of Abraham, a male acappella
group from Baltimore, will sing
everything from gospel to contem-
porary music. On February 22,
Charles Joyner, a professor from
Coastal Carolina University who
specializes in the history of the
Gullah people of South Carolina,
will give a talk on the development
of black culture.

Davidson’s own students will
sound off on the black experience
in School Daze, a parody of their
life at Davidson, on Monday the
23rd at 7 p.m. in the 900 Room.
All of these events are free to
Davidson students, including the
jazz performance inthe Commons,
which will take place on Tuesday
the 28th at 5:30 p.m.

Drunken students vandalize Outpost art

By Ranpy HARTWELL

During efforts to enhance the
Union Outpost’s atmosphere with
student artworkat the Jumpin’ Java
Café on Saturday, a group of stu-
dents interrupted progress by paint-
ing drug-related slogans over the
newly-finished murals. The cof-
feehouse, which ran from 2 to 6
p.m., provided paint for art majors
and other interested students to
beautify the entry and one other
wall.

ing day, Outpost Committee chair

requirements for trustees and the

president. The issue will be fo--

cused on at the sping retreat for the
trustees.

Blueprints for a new College
Union, possibly in Johnston Gym,
were also passed around. SGA
President Bill Gullan felt that the
plans were “incredible ... I wish
that every student could have seen
them. I hope that we can do it.””

According to Rosenbach, the
trustees met without much input
from the students..

The SGA had attempted to get
a greater number of students at the

trustee meeting, but it did not hap-

pen. Rosenbach says, “It is frus-
trating that the students have
worked so hard to get minimal
attention from the trustees,”

SGA Vice President Warren
Buford feels that this problem can-
not be entirely blamed on trustees.

“We haven’ t put an aggressive ef- .

fort into trying to get an adequate
representation in trustee meetings,

The Trustee Executive Coun-

cil discussed putting more students -

on trustee committees, which pro-
vides some hope for the future.
The increased representation was

one of Rosenbach’s big pushes as .

SGA president.

The trustees also inducted
seven new trustees, which accord-
ing to Dr. John Kelton, the Assis-
tant to the President, is “higher

than usual,” which can be attrib-
uted to a large number of retiring
trustees.

The new trustees are Barbara
Campbell Davis, Dr. Laurie L,
Dunn ‘77, Jane Craig Hanes,
Rebecca B. Jones, The Hon. Boyce
F. Martin ‘57, Jerry T. Norvell Jr.
‘58, R. David Sprinkle ‘66, and
William Thompson ‘65.

Sherry Abdelaaty says she wanted
to “give student artists a chance to
mold the outpost into something
new and exciting, and to get their
artwork displayed in an unconven-
tional way. They were thrilled to
be able to leave a mark.”

That mark was blemished
around 6 p.m., when five drunken
students entered the Outpost,
picked up brushes, and began paint-
ing marijuana-related slogans over
other students’ art.

Outpost Committee member
and contributing artist Mike Bodé
says, “They came in with beer in
hand, slapping insults on a wall. I

spect of other artists wasn’t main-
tained. It didn’t mean anything
beyond them; they just wanted to
get their names up there.”

The group was informed that
their graffiti was not appreciated
and warned that it would probably
be painted over.

Gullan agrees that the issue is
a priority. “It was an honor to
attend their meetings as a student
representative. However, I am
cognizant of how they have
snubbed us in the past. They were
very polite and receptive to me,
and despite problems in the past, I
hope they will allow me and the
students to play an instrumental
role in Davidson College decision-
~ making.”
