SANDBURG

PRESENTS

LECTURE ON POETRY

Varied, Discussion Is Characterized By Brilliant Wit and Strik-
ing Expression; Speaker Reads Poems, Proverbs,
and Folklore

Carl Sandburg, noted poet and biographer, mentioned
everything but “Hyacinths and Biscuits,” his subject, in a

lecture filled with scintillating wit and keenly,

pressed phrases, here, Monday eve-
ning. His audience filled to over-
flowing the Chambers Auditorium.

After being introduced by Dr, E.
F. Shewmake, praised
the freedom of speech and action
in this country, but warned of the

Sandburg

difficulty of distinguishing between
the true and the untrue in the so-

cial and political currents of to-
day. In preparing his biography
of Lincoln, the author was im-

pressed with the contrasted beliefs
of the political commentators of the
time, and especially with the great
number of writers whose predic-
tions of the future seem utterly ab-
surd to the Student of the post-war

period. Great changes, he said, are
going on in those “kettles of dyna-
mite,” Germany, Italy, and Spain,

and no one knows what will be the
result. “A past not yet dead is
struggling with a future not—yet
born.”

Just so, he said, conflicting cur-
rents affect the surface of modern
literature, and it is up to the read-
er to judge which
with regard to the
come of the changes. For that rea-
that it choice,
he said that he had stopped trying
“gimlet something through the
ivory domes” of his op-
ponents.

Then the speaker
preted some examples, of his own
poetry. The first
called “Father and Son,” full of ad-
from age to youth. This was
followed by two humorous jingles.

And then came one of the high-
lights of the evening, a poem filled
with some of the unbelievable sub-
jects of folklore. Among them
were “pancakes thin they had

ducted to the Davidson side and
there the sixteen girls were pre-
sented to the West stands by Mr
Smith, They were then taken to
the opposite side of the fiéid and
presented to the crowd in the East
stands.

After the presentation the two
groups exchanged bouquets. For
the first half each group had carried
the colors of the opposing, team on
its bouquet, for the secand half

Large Pep . Meeting Held on
Eve of Game With V. M. I.

Davidson's largest and pepiest

pep.meeting was held Friday night

in the gym. The freshmen filled
the seats around the wall while the
upper-classmen had the wbal cony
well taken care of.

Through the efforts of Varsity
Cheer-Leader Gene’ Vogler, and
with the co-operation of his staff,
a series of acrobatic performances
have been arranged to # the
yells. This added a great deal to
the color of the meeting and td the
response of the students

More music was heard from the
band and a few more yells were
gone over before the main event
came about, this being the well
known “Shirt Tail Parade.’ The
freshmen were Jined up outside the

gym, and started off at-a fast pace.
They ran from one end of the
campus to the other without a stop.
When the upper-classmen _ finally
decided they had run enough for
one night they were stopped in
front of Chambers where the band
played “O Davidson” amid the
cheers of the whole student body.
