Supplement

Church Tower Chimes

In a few weeks the chimes an.
nouncing the time every half an
hour from the bell tower of the
church will be supplemented by
four clocks which will be placed
on each of the four sides of the
steeple.

The clocks, which cost $6,000.00,
were given by Mrs. Marcia Bell
Mitchell in memory of her father,
the late Rev. Samuel Henry Bell,
D.D.,, who graduated from David:
son in 1870.

The new clocks, designed by In-
ternational Business Machines, have
Roman numerals and will be
lighted for night service. The faces
are made of white Carrara glass.

When the Davidson church was
built, the original plan called for
the inclusion of the four clocks.
Due to financial reasons, however,

the clocks were left out and the
four portholes in the steeple, de-
signed to be filled by the clocks,
were temporarily glassed in.

The installment of the clocks
should be completed by the end of
February.

students at the University in
Szeged broke away from the old
Communist youth organization,
“Disz.” and formed a new group.
This group drew up a proclama-

release from the compulsory study

Clubs had been formed among the
young men and writers. They were
called Petafi in honor of the great
national poet of Hungary. Though
no one actually spoke of it, revolu-
tion was on the mind of nearly
every Hungarian.

The Petafi called a mass meet-
ing in Budapest for early Septem-
ber. I didn’t hear about it, or I
would certainly have been there.
My friends who went told me that
the writers who led the meeting
spoke more boldly than ever be-
fore. I read in the Communist
newspaper the next day that this
meeting was “fascist inspired.” but
this only proved to me that the
speakers had asked for freedom
,from the Communist reign of ter-
ror,

I was at work and could not be
at the meeting, but a colleague of
mine brought me a mimeographed
copy of the Proclamation. We typed
as many as we could and distri-
buted them in the building. Every-
body was excited. Enthusiasm was
sweeping through the people like
a fever. At lunch time someone
said that people were beginning to
fill the streets to read the procla-
mation, which students had posted
to the walls of buildings. I went
down to the street and found

When the crowd reached the

met by the Secret Police. They
told the crowd to go away, but
the crowd moved on toward the
building. The police fired, and the
Revotution had begun.

Dr. Caroline T. MacBrayer,
Chairman of the Information Com-
mittee of the North Carolina Psy-

several statements concerning the
bill presented by the Association

This bill is designed to protect

dreds of cases in which people
seeking psychological help have
been defrauded by incompetent
persons hiding behind this inade-
quacy in the law.”

The bill, proposed to the Gen-

‘eral Assembly, calls for “an act

to create a state board of exam-
iners in psychology, define the
duties and powers of that board,
to provide for the examination and

be appointed, and that persons| Certification of psychologists, and

and professional standards.

Dr. MacBrayer points out that
North Carolina now has no law
to prevent unethical or fraudulent
practice of “psychology.”

“As the law stands now,” she
Says, “any person can hang out a
shingle as a psychologist. The pub-
lic has no way of knowing his
qualifications.

“There are many trained, com-
petent psychologists practicing in
the state, but their reputations are
endangered and the public is be-
ing defrauded by those who abuse
the name of psychology and, in
many cases, simply bilk the pub-
lic.”

She notes that ten states have al-
ready adopted legal standards, for
Practicing psychologists, and that

‘Others are planning to follow.

"*This is one area where the pres-
ent laws in some states, includ.
ing North Carolina, actually pro-
tect the confidence man posing as
a psychologist.

Noting the difference between
psychology and psychiatry, which
requires a medical degree, she
adds that “the medical require-
ment protects the psychiatrist, but
many people are not aware of the
difference between psychology and

and sometime perform the same
tasks.

dent interviewed. While providing
a friendly, informal atmosphere,
the representative answers any
questions the students may have
concerning the various aspects of
the company.

The student is encouraged to ex-

It is therefore important for the
prospective graduate to approach
