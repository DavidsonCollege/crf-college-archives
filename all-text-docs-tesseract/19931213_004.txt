Eating disorders seek out their prey over the holiday

By Mandy Curtis

Family problems may not be
the only fear of students over the
holidays. For some, the fear of
food and body image is a problem
for many, particularly woman.
Eating disorders, especially
bulimia, find their prey over the
holiday season--those who fall to
the bitter sweet tortures and temp-
tations of yuletide parties com-
plete with all the holiday trappings.

Christmas cookies, everlast-
ing candy canes, tempting turkey
and stuffing, chocolate Santas, and,
of course, the figgy pudding--what
to do after eating all this? Many
fall victim to compulsive overeat-

ing, others will head to the bath-
room, and still others will simply
starve themselves.

Purging after a binge is the
most common course of action. It
is what many people think is the
answer to that stuffed and uncom-
fortable feeling after gorging on
the amazing home-cooked dinner
that they haven’t tasted in so long
after subsisting on two salads a day
in the Commons for a semester.

But “binging and purging” is
not the answer for the holiday sea-
son, nor any season, according to
counselors DeWitt Crosby and
Georgia Ringle of the student
health service. Say Crosby and

Ringle, bulimia is not a way to
keep off the pounds, not over
Christmas, not over New Years,
not ever:

Crosby and Ringle believe that
20% of Davidson females are
bulimic. It is an eating disorder
they see more and more in over-

achieving, high stressed, perfec-

tionist women. Says Ringle,
“Davidson drawsa high risk group”
for eating disorders.-

Ringle defined two kinds of
eating disorders: those that are the
result of deep-rooted problems and
those that are situational or “infec-
tious.” DeWittsays that “the deep-
rooted eating disorder is very diffi-

culttoovercome.” The latter, how-
ever, issomething that can be more
easily stopped when one is taken
out of the situation.

Ringle and DeWitt concur that
most often, women are more con-
cerned with how other women view
them than hew the opposite sex
sees them. Pressure from peers
and the media are twostrong forces
aiding in eating disorder inflation.

What many women do not
understand is that their bodies are
maturing to the maternal stage,
according to Ringle. Women are
not going to look the same as they
did when they were girls.

Although rampant among

women throughout the: year, eat-
ing disorders inflate over the holi-
days. Body image tends to become
more of a problem when sitting
down to eat a five course Christ-
mas dinner. Food is the focus of
the holiday season; it is-a social
symbol.

As a means of changing the
focus to help, DeWitt and Ringle
suggest, getting away from the
house, limiting alcohol intake, ex-
ercising normally, and meeting
with friends. However, it is not
necessary to deny oneself of the
holiday pleasures, there is always
time to work offa few extra pounds
once January comes around.

Seattle University
acquires law school

SEATTLE (CPS)-The Uni-
versity of Puget Sound Law
School was acquired by Seattle
University in November in amove
to strengthen each university’s
programs and direction, officials
said.

The law school, the largest
in Washington with an enroll-
ment of 800 students, will be as-
sumed by Seattle University be-
ginning September 1, 1994, offi-
cials at both institutions said. The
law school, located in Tacoma,
Washington, will be relocated to
Seattle University within five
years, said the Rev. William
Sullivan, president of the Jesuit
school.

“The academic program will
not change and financial arrange-
ments for students will be com-
parable,” he said.

Seattle University, which of-
fers 19 graduate programs, a doc-
toral program and 49 undergradu-
ate degrees, wants to strengthen
its professional and graduate pro-
grams, while the University of
Puget Sound wants to focus on its
liberal arts aay a pro-
gram.

The card of Trustees at both
institutions decided not to publi-
cize how much the transaction
cost, a University of Puget Sound
spokesman said.

Woman to attend The Citadel
CHARLESTON, _ S.C.
(CPS)-A woman who gained ad-

_ at the college in January, an ap-

‘the value of the college’s single-

mission to The Citadel by alter-
ing references to her gender on
her application will attend classes

peals court ruled November 17.

An appeals court upheld a
ruling to allow the woman, Shan-
non Faulkner, to attend classes
while a discrimination lawsuit is
pending. The lawsuit charges
that the male-only admission
policy is unconstitutional and vio-
lates the 14th Amendment by
denying equal access.

The Citadel is claiming that
the institution should remain
male-only because that’s what
makes the college unique. A
spokesman for the college said
admitting women would elimi-
nate the uniqueness and decrease

sex education.

“We’re trying to maintain a
successful program that has been
supported by the state for 151
years,” said Rick Mill, a spokes-
man for The Citadel. “We’re
arguing the issue of single-sex
education.”

Faulkner has gained the right
toattend classes with corps mem-
bers, but she will not be a cadet.
She will live off campus.

Faulkner, of Powdersville,
S.C., applied to The Citadel ear-
lier this year and had officials at
her high school delete all refer-
ences to her gender. She was
provisionally accepted pending
final transcripts, and then Citadel
officials realized Faulkner’stran-

scripts had been tampered with.

The judges, secretaries from
the Residence Life office, rated the
halls according to three categories.
They looked for originality and
creativity, participation and in-
volvement, and theme and style.

Kurt Holmes, assistant direc-
tor of Residence Life, accompa-
nied the judges around the cam-
pus.

“Theme and style really set
the indoor winners apart,” he says.

According to Holmes, twice
as many halls participated this year
as last year, and there was much
more effort on each individual hall.
“I think that everyone did great
work. It’s a shame we couldn’t
give prizes to everybody.”
