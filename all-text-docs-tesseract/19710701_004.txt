Maybe Self-Examination

Although we must feel happy over Professor Ful-
ier’s appointment as Special Assistant to the Commis-
sioner of Education, we can’t help but express grief
of josing such a dedicated professor. 7

His 103s will be felt not only in the Political Scence
Department, but also in the faculty as a body. A popu-
lar man with the students, Fuller exhibited a teacning
meinud Wa.cn inspired nis students and encouraged
tnem lo use their imagination and creativity. ~

What nis students iked. most about him was his
candid apprroach to probiems both in the ciassroom
and out. and this candor was no more apparent tnan

WHERE IS DAVIDSON GOING?

College’s Future Depends
Upon Loyalty, Concern

By DANIEL D. RHODES
Professor of Religion

Some people ahink of Da-
vidson as ‘a small, male -co}-.
lege <n a small southern
communtty bypassed by the
main stream of life—un-
touched and apai.hecic-—exis:-
ing on myths of the pasi and
conient wih the status quo.

As they see it, the litile
caange thai does occur is
‘nsubstancial and resus only
from whe expended b:.ood,
swea:, and tears of a given
s.udent generation,

Others view the current
Davidson as a mutilated Wal-
den: a smail, ex-male col-
lege in a small southern
community that has become
a spiritual suburb of Char-
lotte-Washington-Detroit or
Berkeley - Columbia - Yale,
which has cast aside all past
ideals and is content only
with the discontent of fran-
tic motion.

As they see %, the mass
changes that sake place are
of wa subs:anvial nature, en
dangering the characier of
che inetkucion, and resulting
from ques.ionable admissions
policies, ill-advised faculty
appo-n:ments, and wishy-
wa-hy admin.strative action.

Of course these descrip-
tons are caricaiures. But
chey pon: to real aitudes

concern.

Such inieresi is wholesome
and fortunately is able to
manifest itself at the organ-
izat:onal level. Acumn..

Because of this, productive
compromise is possible.

There is little question that
Davidson is in a period of
radical transition. She can-
noi and should not remain
svatic. Bux she should retain
her identi.y and capztalize
upon her strenguhs in the
m.ds< of her growth.

Durng the past 10 years
Davidson has been engaged
in three major self study
projects. These studies com-
bined w..h the normal on-go-
ing reevaluation processes
nAave produced a variety of
results: the development oi!
-he humanities program, in-
ierdepartmenial courses, ex-
tended studies, revised area
requirements. revised re
quirements in religion, re-
vised policies on social or
ganizations and _ athletics.

Just this spring ‘a ‘trustee::
administration-f
committee |
work on a new system of gov-
ernance for college life. A
new organization for cocur-
ricular activities wll be pre-
sented next year. And at a
reasonably near date in the
future the trustees will com-
pleie their revision of the
college By Laws.

Davidson is changing.

The question is: Can Da-
v.dson revain her identity in
ne mids. of these changes?
Do the changes coniribuie to
-he reaizaiion of her best
self? Will Davidson students
look back upon their under-
graduate experience wih ap-
precta.ion? W.1l graduaie and
professional schoots find our
students well prepared?

In the past, Davidson has
done a reasonably able job
of providing the context in
which students could get the
basics of a liberal arts edu-
cation and preparation for
professional and graduate
school work.

Many facul:y members are
concerned lest we so alter
our educational processes
hs: our students get by with
a m.nmimum of rigorous schol-

carly acdvi:y to the eventual!

de:rmeni of our students’
professional lLves. Do we
need a li.tle time 10 do some
fine tun:ng of the educational
instrument we have a ready
designed?

Many people, on and off
the Campus, are quite, con-
cerned about college policy
in regard to the personal
conduct of siuden.s, social
organ’ zaions, and athletics.

These are areas that con-

ta y-sttident..3

W.. ing io reexamine them in
igh. of current _.cjrcum-
sumances. -

!. is to be hoped that the
administrai.on will continue
2 communicate with the
\waole college community (in-
cluc.ng friends and alumni)
explaining the overall direc-
t.on of the college and in
parccular che new policies
re-ating 0 fraternities and
‘ heeiies. —

It is further to be hoped
that the college can come
up with a sane policy and
procedure that will express
its interest in and concern
about student conduct .

Finally, we should note that
Davidson thas not escaped
che economic squeeze of the
day. Income from conven-
. uival sources has shrunk and
new money is hard to raise.
As a small, private college
Davidson is genuinely vuin-
erable.

A time of transition and
tight money provides those
who are looking for excuses
an opportune moment in
which to be destructively
critical or file for divorce.

At the same time it chal-
lenges students, faculty, ad-
min.strators, trustees.
churchmen, alumni, and
friends to explore and ex-
press new depths of loyalty
and creative concern. Da-
v.dson fhias {ived on such
loya:ty. and her future de-
pends upon it.

.. . and two to go!
