The Trustees finally came through!

Dan S. LaFar, '57, currently assistant Alumni and
Publicity Secretary, is the new President of Davidson
College, Mr. Dan R. LaFar, Chairman of the Presidential
Nominating Committee, announced today.

The vote was extremely close, Big LaFar admitted,
between LaFar and President Emeritus ‘Slick John”
Cunningham. The committee recently learned that
“Slick” was dissatisfied with his setup at the Presby-
terian Foundation and desired to return to the Hill.

“However,” Big LaFar said, “we were looking for a|'
‘young man and evidently got what we wanted. Johnny

was strongly considered but we felt his money-getting
days are over and that young Dan has potential for being

‘}even slicker.”

mented: “He would have made us a lot of loot but un-
fortunately he didn’t listen, to Liz.” ;
LaFar will be formally inaugurated at Commence-
ment this June and will replace C. Jerry Pietenpol, ef-
fective September 1. At the inauguration cermony C.

Shaw Smith will invest him with the Woody Wilson Seal!

the crown and scepter.

‘PRETTY GOOD DEAL’

When informed of his promotion LaFar had this to
say: “It sounds like a pretty good deal. Hope I'll have
time for it.”

It is reputed that one of the first actions LaFar wil)
take during his reign will be the abolishment of the
Executive Committee. “‘We do not intend to submit to

Student Head Interviewed

‘They Won't Get
Me’---K'dall

I found myself standing outside the student govern-
ment office, wondering whether president-elect John
Kuykendall was really inside; if he was, this was the end

of a long search.

I tapped gently on the door—

certain DAVIDSONIAN person-

nel recently, a party who asked
that his name be omitted, con-
ducted a poll of the student
body last week with the follow-
ing results!

The typical Davidson student
does know who's who and what's
what!

The lists contained the fol-
lowing names: Dr. C. J. Pieten-
pol, Mr. Dwight Eisenhower,
Steve Roper, Johnny Mathis, Dr.
Louis Schenck, Dr. Tom Daggy,
John Kuykendall, Dorothy Ma-
lone, Woodrow Wilson, Mike
Todd, Joe DiMaggio, Gen. Max-
well Taylor, Peyton Place, Tom
Scott, and Chalmers Davidson.

The average student  suc-
ceeded in naming twelve of the
fifteen. Most often missed were
Eisenhower, who many thought
was a member of the Davidson
Board of Trustees; Wilson, who
was listed as “one of the local
barbers” and “a TV comedian;”
and Davidson, who was on many
ballots “the man for whom the
college is named.”

Lanin Chickens Out;
Lawrence Welk Hired

Lawrence Welk and his famed orchestra will replace
Lester Lanin for this coming Spring Frolics dance week-
end, April 18-19, IFC President Bob Jones announced
recently. Lanin had heard reports of the student body's
conduct and was afraid of being hissed and booed..,

contract to play in Carnegie
Hall that weekend in order to
make the trip to Davidson.
When asked what he thought
of the engagement, Welk re-
plied, “Wonderful, ° wonderful.
Ever since I began taking mail-
order music lessons, I have
dreamed of playing a dance for
the Davidson’ students. My
chance has come.”

The emphasis for the
weekend will be placed on
formality, dignity, and
revelry, the (FC president

that all efforts should be
made to carry out this.

IBM System Set For
Davidson In 3 Years

The International Business Machine Corporation has
been granted a contract for the installation of a cen-
tralized teaching device to be installed in all classrooms
at Davidson within the next three years.

The new device will provide
for all teaching to be done me-
chanically from a central con-
trol center, to be located in the
dome of Chambers building.
Complete details on the IBM
Master-Teach System, as it is
named, were unavailable at
press time, but it is expected
to do away with the need for
the majority of the faculty. The
IBM salesman has stated, “A
sixth grader could operate the
thing.”

Installation of the new device
is in keeping with the move to
keep Davidson a step ahead of
its competitors in the education
field, and with the increased en-
rollment situation. Through this
new set-up, four times as many
students will be able to receive
instruction in a given course.

The chairman of the Trustees
Committee, when contacted,
said, “This is great! We can now
increase the enrollment for
1860 to 2500!"

The IBM Corporation  ex-
pressed a genuine joy in having
this opportunity to install their
system in another of the coun-
try’s large schools. Such sys-
tems are already in use at
UCLA, Mlinois, Michigan State,
and Cal. Tech.

lation in order to insure Welk's
enthusiasm during the week-
end, although certain revisions
will have to be made in the
present plans for the dance in
order ,to carry out the agree-
ment.

Jim Jones, the Dance Com-
mittee Chairman, stated that
the decorations will vary slight-
ly from the traditional. pattern
used often in the past. The
formal dance will be held in the
Ballroom of the Union rather
than the gymnasium where it
has traditionally been held. This
will add to the formality of the
occasion, Jones announced, and
will also render the decorating,
which will be done by a well-
known Charlotte firm, much

easier.

Three Additions To

Several new additions were
named to the faculty of 1958-59
recently. Number one on the
list was the appointment of
Elizabeth Taylor, former star
of motion pictures, who will in-
struct a new course, Philosophy
53, on Emotional Conflicts. Miss
Taylor is the author of the re-
cent. book, “Perils of Married
Life.” At present she is work-
ing on her doctorate at Chica-

Committee Decides
Four Frafs Must Go

Four fraternities must go!

That was the word from the
joint IFC-Executive Committee
study of the Skit Nite-Preferen-
tial Bidding-Snowball situation.

Chairman of the joint com.
mittee, Prof. Tom Daggy, an-
nounced today that after ex-
tensive study of the situation,
the only plausible solution to
the problem is to revoke the
charters of four fraternities on
campus.

This will not only serve to
increase the Independent group
on campus and make for more
select fraternities, which are
two aims of the preferential
bidding, but it will show the

students who the real boss on
the campus is.

Daggy went on to say that.) P#

again after much study, the only
Jogical and fair way to de-
termine which fraternities must
leave the campus was to have
a completely disinterested party
draw the names of four frater-
nities from a hat. This drawing
will be held in the Union ball-
room next Wednesday at chapel
period.
