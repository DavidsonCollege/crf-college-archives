Opposes Racial And Religious Bias

|
|

By BUCK LAWRIMORE

In a special meeting Tues-
day, the faculty determined
by a 34-28 vote to con-
tinue the “underachieve-
ment” program but within
a more generalized frame-
work. In other action the
group passed a resolution
discouraging racial and re-
ligious discrimination in
campus organizations.

The meeting was prompted
by a deadlock on the ‘‘under-
achievement” issue at the reg-
ular faculty meeting on May 5.
Unexpected by most professors
was the action against discrimi
nation, prompted for the most
part by the college's recent ad-
mission of its first American
Negro students, who are ex-
pected to enroll this fall.

Adopted by a voice vote, the
following resoluti was intro
duced in the form of two mo-
tions:

“lt shall be the policy of the
faculty to discourage discrim-
ination on the basis of race or
religion by any organization
which is officially recognized
by the college as a legitimate
campus organization.”

The first motion treated dis-
crimination on the basis of
‘race’ while a second motion
dealt with discrimination based
on the “Christian religions.”
However, before the second mo-
tion was voted on, a substitute
motion was offered deleting the
word ‘‘Christian.”’

Dr. R. W. Gable, who intro-
duced the original resolution,

| said, “The spirit of the thing

was more a reaffirmation (of
faculty feeling) than anything
else.”

The new underachievement
adoptions replacing the old sys-
tem are as follows:

*‘We wish to help each student
realize his potential. In aca-
demic. areas there is reason to
suspect that one is falling short
of his potential if his grades are
considerably below his predicted
average or if one or more of his
instructors judges that he is not
accomplishing what he is capa-
ble of accomplishing.

“When there is reason to
suspect that a student is not
realizing his potential, the
Dean of Students will confer
with the student and his ad-
viser. Hf, after these confer-
ences, the Dean concludes that
the student is falling short of
his potential, then:

*(1) the Dean shall notify, in
writing, the student and his par-
ents of this conclusion and of
its consequences:

(2) the Dean shall arrange
for individual counseling for the
student and coordinate all ef-
forts to improve his academic
performance; and

**(3) should the student not

show satisfactory academic im
provement, in the opinion of the
Dean, he shall be referred
the Executive Committee of the
Faculty under the provisions of
Section IV C 1 of these regula

tions." |

to

The teeth of the system. lie in}
the re-written regulation (Sec-|
tioi IV C 1): “Any = student}
whose performance in the class
room indicates that he is not|
making a serious effort to do an
acceptable quantity and quality
of work may be required to
withdraw from the College by)
the Executive. Committee of the}

Faculty.”

Implementation of the revamp
ed “underachievement” pro-
gram was left to the discretion
of the Executive Committee.

Discussing the deadlock at
the May 5 meeting, President
Martin said:

“The committee revising the
program had presented its rec
ommendations, but they. were
being accepted after several
amendments had been made.

“Then Dr. (W. G.) Workman
made this alternate proposal
that we have now accepted,
Well, we accepted it at the last
meeting, too, but before the is-
sue was over someone voted to
do away with underachievement
altogether and we became lock-
ed in a tie vote.

‘‘Because it was so late and
many people had left I refused
to break the tie, and we decid-
ed to meet this week instead,”
he continued. '

“After a great deal of discus-
sion we reaccepted Dr. Work-

man's proposal as the new un-/)
program. Ob-/

derachievement
viously it loosens the restrictions
on students, but it still leaves
some incentive for them to make
achievements according to their
level of ability and for the Col
lege to ask the withdrawal of
anyone who does not do satis-
factory work.”

Martin pointed out, too, that
the faculty stand on discrimi-
nation will be “discourage dis-
crimination” and not “‘force
removal of discrimination.”

It was decided that beginning
next September any student may
take 19 semester hours of work
regardless of his grades, and no
less than 12 hours. But the in
creased year-end requirements
will become effective only with
the entering freshman class,
much like increased fees and
other requirements have been
handled in recent years.

The restrictions of academic
probation will also disappear in
September.

The re-admission requirements
to become effective with the en-

tering freshman class area are:
—Into the sophomore year, 25

mester hours, 22 quality
99

points

semester hours, quality

Into the

“<Faculty Asks Trustees
To Review Vow Again

Influenced by a conference of about 12 faculty members with key trustees
Wednesday night, the Board of Trustees in a surprise move yesterday sent the fac-

ulty oath question back to

At the meeting of Feb. 19,
the Trustees gave initial approv
al to a new faculty oath and a
new method of administering it
to professors. However, for the
College Charter to be amended,
the Trustees must approve new
proposals at two consecutive
meetings.

After they adopt amendments
at a meeting, it is usual proce
dure for the Trustees to rubber
stamp them at the next one.
After the last meeting of the
board, D. G. Martin, president
of the college, said, ‘‘The pro
posal to change the vow made

iby the Trustees today is tanta

mount to their approval at the
next meeting.”

Dr. J. McDowell Richards,
president of the board, said
that the Trustees voted to send
the whole oath issue back to
the Education Committee be-
cause, ‘The fact is that no-
body was really satisfied with
the new vow.”

Richards said that the prime

was due to the conference the
night before between a small
group of professors dissatisfied
with the new oath, himself, Mar
tin, Dean of the Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston, Dr. James P. Hen
drix of the Education Commit
tee, Dr. C. L. Brown, and Rev.
Albert McClure.

“The conference influenced
my own thinking on the matter,
and I am sure it did other peo
ple's, too,"’ Richards said.

Martin said that the main
point brought up by the faculty
members was their objection to
the taking of any type of a pub
lie oath.

“The impression that | got,”

Martin continued, “was that
there would be much less ob-
jection to some other kind of
commitment. They didn't
think any type of commission-
ing exercise is appropriate for
teachers who have been teach-
ing here for a good while.”

which he referred was up

refused to. confirm. It

doubts plagued the mind of Hill.

In his three appearances on
campus Monday, Hill spoke
with some profanity and much
arrogance about American ra
cial problems. A_ considerable
part of the initial audience punc

tion with low. whistles, jeering
and ill-timed applause.

Later, the speaker referred to
his reception with the comment,
“You are behaving like a bunch
of fools."

“You may be inviting . . .

Said Hill, “Race is a unique
problem in America, From the
beginning there has been a con-
tradiction. The official declara-
tion that the black man was
property has been a corroding
quality in this country. The
whole problem is coming to
roost in this generation.”

The labor secretary went on
to note that we are now con-
fronted with a colored genera-
tion that has a new image of
itself. He predicted a tragic fu-
ture, “if Negroes are left to
fight this battle alone.”

Less than half an hour later,
Hill answered a question with
the remark, “The Negro com-
munity is going to decide what
is best for the Negro commu-
nity. This is the difference be-

tween yesterday and today.”

The campus visitor said he had
felt the 1954 Supreme Court de-
cision would allow the Southern
moderates to speak up. He la-

mented the failure of this voice

to be heard and noted the
development of ‘“‘totalitarian
thought control" in the South.

Hill repeatedly stated that the
NAACP is opposed to any quota
system in labor negotiations.
“All we want is merit employ
ment; there is nothing in title
seven of the Civil Rights Bill
before Congress that contradicts
this stand,"

The NAACP, according to Hill,
also does not oppose a literacy
test—‘'as long as it is admin
istered fairly."’ In some parts
of the South, he said, Negroes
are asked such questions as,
“How many bubbles are there
in a bar of soap?” as a require
ment for voting.

At the close of his first ap
pearance, Hill voiced consider-
able alarm. “‘If I have failed to
communicate to you, then I am
very sad, for you are inviting
catastrophe. The fundamental
issue is whether or not this coun
try has a future. We cannot ex-
ist with the dead traditions of a
dead past."

Later in the day his tone soft-
ened but the feeling remained

that he was talking down to his

audience. ‘“‘When you think
about it, the demands we make
are not so revolutionary, so rad-
ical , ... We say the test of color
is no longer a valid test. You
have a right to hate anybody
you damn well please but you

don't have the right to hit them |

over the head,”

The labor secretary was not
at all hesitant to speak on the
public school situation. He felt

that re-training was the obvi-
the drop-out °

ous solution to
problem but lamented the inferi
or training given to Negro par
ticipants in such programs in
the South.

De facto segregation in the
North, according to Hill, is ac-
complished by drawing dis-
trict lines with the intent to
segregate. “‘All we want to do
is re-draw the lines with the
intent of integrating.” This
controversial subject has met
with little success in the court
for the NAACP, but Hill did
not seem discouraged.

The speaker's comment in as-
sembly that the rate of de-seg-

|
regation since the 1954 decision
has been ‘‘a trifle above one per
cent in the deep South” drew ap
plause from the audience, Hill
retorted, “If you want to ap
plaud—if that gives you any sort
of gratification—then go ahead.”
Asked by a student, ‘Aren't
you an outside observer looking
at our problems without quali-
fication?"’, Hill replied,
“Whether you like it or not,
North Carolina is still in the Un-
ion. I've spent half of my work
ing time in the South for the
past 21 years.”

Later, Hill requested that a
student change his pronuncia-
tion of the name for the race
from “‘Nigro”’ to “Negro.” “‘is
it so hard for you people to
pronounce it correctly?” he de-
manded,

Herbert Hill liked to refer to
the NAACP as the “true mod-
erates’’ in the fight for racial

Inevitably, many stu
dents were reminded of CORE

who visited the campus last
spring. His organization is gen-
erally considered more militant
than the NAACP, its policies
more likely to alienate a south-

But Farmer left behind with
the students a feeling of respect,
even admiration. Herbert Hill

to the vocation of teaching and
will you seek faithfully to per
form the task of teacher, to in
form the minds of students and
to create in them’ a thirst for
knowledge, a love of wisdom,
and a reverence for truth?"

With the Trustees’ refusal to
adopt for the second time the
new amendment, the old Char-
ter regulations remain in ef-
fect for the time being. These
are the ones which have drawn
heavy fire so often in the past,
and whose opponents have for
so long demanded changes.

The old regulations require

that the following oath be ad-
ministered during commence-
ment to those who are being in-
augurated as full professors:

“a. Do you acknowledge Jesus
Christ as Lord and Savior and
do you believe in the fundamen-
tal teachings of evangelical
Christianity?

“b

Do you believe the scrip
of the Old and New Testa

to be the word of God,

the only infallible rule of faith
and practice?

“ce. Do you promise in the
humble reliance upon the gracé
of God, which comes by the

Holy Spirit, so to live and teach
as to give expression to the
Christian faith?”

Opponents of this oath argued
that it is open to many different
interpretations, that the profess
ors who take it should not be
subjected to affirming their faith
before a strange and often dis
interested commencement audi-
ence, and that only a. small
number of the faculty—the full
professors — actually have
take the oath.

Martin said that at the meet
ing. Wednesday night, McClure
made a proposal that seemed to
please the majority of the fac-
ulty members in attendance, He
Suggested that the dean of the
faculty and the president make
sure of a man’s commitment to
the ideals of the college when
he is first hired. Martin added
that not all of the Trustees
agreed with this proposal. It will
be one of the matters studied by
the Education Committee.

Mrs. H. H. Gordon, the
widow of .a Presbyterian
minister, will assume Mrs.
J. B. Moore’s position as Su-
pervisor of Dormitories this
summer.

A native of West Virginia,
Mrs. Gordon presently serves
as Secretary of the Meadows
Presbyterian Church in Char-
lottesville, Va. She attended Jef-
ferson Professional Institute.

Mrs. Gordon moved to Char-
lottesville at the death of her
husband, Rev. H. H- Gordon,
DD. She previously lived in Tex-
as, Louisiana, Missouri and
West Virginia and is the mother
of four children.

In addition to her two sons
enrolled at Union
Seminary, Richmond, and
University of Virginia, Mrs.
Gordon has a daughter, 16, and
another son, nine.

Of her decision to come to Da
vidson, Mrs. Gordon said, ‘‘Aft
er reading the editorial in THE
DAVIDSONIAN about Mrs.
Moore and the relationship be
tween Davidson men and the
Supervisor of Dormitories, I
couldn't resist the opportunity
when it was presented to me, to
become a part of the Davidson
community.”

Before accepting the position,
Mrs. Gordon visited the campus
where she talked with numer-
ous administrators. ‘““Mrs. Gor-
don came so highly recommend-
ed and we were so favorably
impressed by her," said Assist-
amt to the President Everett

“She has all the attributes of

“She is capable and will be able

to render the kind of service
necessary,”’

In addition to her personal
qualities, Gourley listed another
prime qualification as her ex-
perience in raising her three
sons. Summing up administra-
tive opinion, he said, “Every
one is very happy that Mrs.
Gordon will be here next year."

Mrs. Moore described her suc-
cessor as a ‘very charming per-
son. . . ideally suited for a per
sonal relationship with the stu-
dents."’ Because of her enthusi-
asm for working with young
people, Mrs. Moore feels that
Mrs. Gordon will have the
“same rapport that the students
and I have enjoyed.”
