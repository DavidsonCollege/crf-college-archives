Here at Davidson, Bruce

The cause of Batman's popu-
larity has been debated a good
dea! since his first bout with
crime on channel 8.

It has been attributed most
often to the fact. that our hero
is “half-camp, half-kid", or, to
put it another way, he is so
‘kid!’ that he's ‘‘camp.” For the
uninitiated that means that the
show is so very, very bad it's
good... or as one of the Caped
Crusader’s Batfans would say,
“It's Batastic!”’

that a student-faculty committee be given the

want one.

The proposal, one of a series
of recommendations which would
bring sweeping changes to the
present rush structure, was re-
vealed to fraternity presidents
and members of the Interfrater-
nity Council jin a meeting this
afternoon.

The Committee, chaired by
Dr. W. G. Workman, professor
of psychology, will present its
ideas to the faculty Tuesday and
ask for approval of the propos-
als. ‘

Other proposals would act to
postpone the formal rush period,
while at the same time liberal-
ize restrictions on informal rush.

The recommendations ask that
formal rush be delayed until the
conclusion of first semester of
the year 1966-67.

. At the same time, restrictions
on. contact between freshmen
and upperclassmen would be al-
most completely removed, with
several exceptions: after 7:30
p.m. on week-nights, upperclass-
men will not be allowed in fresh:
man dorms and freshmen are
[not to be in fraternity houses,
if the recommendations are ap
proved.

_The committee also recom-
mended that. freshmen eat in the
College Union and participate in
freshman intramurals both se-
mesters. In addition, it express-
ed approval of the work of the
new Social Council and urged
that it should continue its work.

Actual. implementation of the
plan -to assure all interested
freshmen a bid would be left up
to the IFC. with the only -re-
striction being that each individ-
ual concerned would be. granted
the opportunity of remaining a
pledge for at least one year.

According ,to the recommen-
dations, such a plan would not
be operative next year but would
go into effect during the year
1967-68.

The Social Life Evaluation

spring at.the request of the fac.

members appointed by President
D. G. Martin include Chairman

Reynolds Lectures
Set For Semester

Under the sponsorship of the
Reynolds Lecture series, Dr.
James MacGregor Burns and
Dr. Margaret Mead will speak
at Davidson this semester.

Dr. Burns. who will speak on
April 26 and 27, is a professor at
Williams College. He has writ-
ten several books, including the
current best-seller The Deadlock
of Democracy, Dr. Burns recent-
ly spent some time in Washing-
ton in an advisory capacity
which provided material for his
latest book on executive Jeader-
ship and presidential policy.

Dr. Mead, a noted anthropol-
ogist, is scheduled to speak on
May 11 and 12. She is currently
in New Guinea where she is
making some studies for the
American Museum of Natural
History in New York.

Per

semester’s study of the Davidson fraternity
recommended the adoption of a plan in whic
man would be guaranteed a bid to a fraternity, should he

every fresh-

ber Tom Covington, assistant
dean of students and fraternity
liaison officer.

Student members are seniors
John Burks, George Kuykendall’
and Paul Simpson and sopho-
more Tom Earnhardt.

The committee has met sev-
eral times weekly since Sep-
tember to study problems of the
social life of the Davidson stu-
dent.

“Most of the problems,’ ex-
plained Epes, ‘‘are involved with
much more than simply the fra-
ternity system. We have, how-
ever, tried working within the
framework of the fraternity sys-
tem to come up with plans which
show promise of ameliorating
these problems.”

A number of groups, including
the Freshman Council. Social
Council, Social Council, IFC and
fraternity treasurers, were in-
vited to express their opinions to
the committee during the semes-
ter, Workman said.

In addition, each fraternity
submitted, as a unit, a state-
ment on its position on the role
of fraternities in the overall
structure of life at Davidson.

Though Workman admitted.
that it would be foolish to ex-
pect that a complete solution to
the Davidson student's social
problem had been found. he ex-
pressed hope that the proposals
would be approved by the fac-
ulty, as a forward step in im-
proving the social atmosphere
on the campus.

AAC Elects
Martin

Treasurer

President D. Grier Martin was
recently elected treasurer of the
Association of American Col
leges at their 52nd annual meet-
ing in Philadelphia, Pa.

As treasurer, he automatical-
ly becomes a, member of the
Board of Directors. The AAC is
the foremost association of col-
lege presidents in the United
States.

The AAC, an organization of
liberal arts colleges, primarily
private and church-related, co-
ordinates projects among its
members. It deals with the par-
ticular needs of iis members and

gram at Davidson). It is divided
into several divisions which do
research on various projects.

ganization is the Most Rev.

No Election Planned
To Fill Council Vacancy

The vacancy created by the de-
parture of Student Council Sec-
ond Vice-President Chuck Mat-
thews will not be filled untfi the
upcoming student: wide elections,
it was decided Monday by the
Student Council.

_ Matthews, studying this se-
mester in Washington, D. C.,
will return to Davidson next fall.

According to the Student Body
Constitution, Matthews’ unex-
pired term should be filled by
a special election. ‘‘However,"’
stated Bill Council, student body
president, ‘‘since there is such
a short period (less than two
weeks) befween a proposed spe-
cial election and the regular
elections, there is no reason to
fill the term by election."’

Arrangements were made for
the distribution and collection of
student body questionnaires to
be handled during chapel on
Thursday. These questionnaires
concern ideas on Tuesday-Thurs.
day-Saturday schedules, and éx-
am and review regulations.

The faculty reaction to the new
student body drinking regula-
tions was also discussed. Coun-
cil voiced that the faculty, ‘‘al-
though pledged to a dry campus,
would probably take no extreme
action unless serious disturb-
ances in the dorms and grounds
arose."’

Discussion on other actions,
such as the method of selecting
future chairmen of the social
council, and the Kuykendall pe-
tition, was postponed unti next
week's meeting.

The Kuykendall petition, en-

tailing a revision of Honor Court
procedures. will be worked on
by the Student Council in con-
junction with the Honor Court.
A student body vote on the pe-
tition will probably be held with-
in-the next few weeks. °

Three Changes Asked
In Honor System Setup

By MIKE POWELL
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Three major proposed chang-
es in Davidson’s Honor System
and in the structure of the Hon-
or Court will be presented. to the
student body in Tuesday's chap-

el.

The changes are In the form
of three proposed amendments
to the Student Body Constitu-
tion. Official voting by the stu-
dent body has been set for one
week from Tuesday.

The first proposed amendment
states that Article V, Section 5
of the Student Body Constitu-
tion shall be changed to read:
“Trial procedur®&shall be deter
mined by the Honor Court and
made available to the student
body. This shall include an in-

vestigation committee of three.

members elected by the Student
Council] and a defense advisor
elected by the student body who
shall perform their duties as
prescribed in the Honor Court
procedure.”

“ORDINARILY”

The second states that the
word “ordinarily’’ shall be in-
serted in the Honor Code, Ar-
ticle VII, Section 5, so that this
article would read: ‘‘Every stu-
dent found guilty of violating
any section of this Article shall
ordinarily be dismissed from the
college."

The third proposed amendment

reads as follows: Article II, Sec-
tion 2 of the Constitution shall
be deleted as it now reads and
shall be replaced by an article
which shall read: ‘‘The purpose
of the Honor Court shall be to
encourage and maintain the hon-
or of the student body. Since Da-
vidson strives to be a Christian
college and thus recognizes both
a concern for understanding and
compassion as- well as. for jus-
tice and honor, the Court shall
implement its purpose through
instilling in the student body an
awareness of the basic princi-
ples of honor, through adminis
tering the Honor System, and
through enforcing its decisions
as it sees fit in the light of each
individual case."
DISCUSSIONS

The three proposals are the re-
sult of discussions which have
been taking place among mem-
bers of the Honor Court and the
student body since before Christ-
mas.

Also influential in the propos-
als was a petition presented to
the Student Council during the
first days of January by a group
of 51 Davidson students.

This petition was read to the
entire student body at that time,
but George Kuykendall, organ-
izer of the petition, agreed at
that time to postpone voting on
the petition until second semes-
ter so that freshmen would be

eligible to vote.

In the interim the Honor Court
codified the proposals they had
been discussing and after dis-
cussion with Kuykendall com-
bined their proposals with those
contained in his petition to form
the three proposed amendments
to be presented Tuesday. ;

Concerning the final proposals,
Kuykendall told THE DAVID-
SONIAN that he believes the
changes in his proposals recom-
mended to him by the Honor
Court proposals will carry out
the purposes of his recommen-
dations, but in a better way.

Jim Stokes, chairman of the
Honor Court, said of the. three
new proposals: “I think this is
a significant improvement in the
(Honor Court) procedure since
it takes the investigative func-
tion out of the hands of those
who make the final decision on
an honor offense."

To complete their proposals,
the Honor Court has détailed the
duties of the new investigative
committee and the defense ad-
visor. Pending student body ap-
proval of the first proposed
amendment, the following duties
and specifications for the new
officers will be added to the
Honor Court trial procedure:

“An investigation committee
separate from the Honor Court,
which shall be composed of two
seniors and one junior shall be

elected from the student body
each year by the Student Coun- .
cil. This committee shall inves-
tigate all violations of the Hon-
or System and the Student Body
Regulations which are reported. -
The committee shall designate
one of its members, to be call-
ed the investigator, to present
the facts of the alleged violation
to the Honor Court. if a trial is
necessary. The investigator shall
function solely as a witness. The
investigation committee shall
consider whatever information
it may gather as strictly confi-
dential.

“A defense advisor separate
from the Honor Court, who shall
be a senior elected by the stu-
dent body, shall inform the ac-
cused of his rights before and
during a. trial and shall see that
these rights are maintained. The
defense advisor shall have the
privilege of questioning any wit-
nesses in order that all informa-
tion in behalf of the accused
may be presented. The defense
advisor shall leave the court-
room during recesses.

“A committee, which shall be
composed of the three members
of the investigation committee,
the defense advisor, and the
chairman of the Honor Court,
shall determine if the evidence
of a violation of the Honor Sys-
tem or Student Body Regulations
warrants a trial.”

Administration Vows To Enforce College Drinking Regulation

By BOB TRAVERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The college administration in.
tends to enforce the faculty's
drinking rule despite its repeal
from the student body constitu-
tion, according to President D.
Grier Martin.

The rule, which has been
adopted jointly by the faculty
and trustees, states that “‘no stu-
dent shall consume or be under
the influence of alcoholic bever-

ages” while he is on the David-
son campus (including the town
of Davidson) or on the Lake
Campus.

This rule, however, does not
prohibit keeping alcohol in the
locked trunks of student auto-
mobiles.

Students also are prohibited by

this rule from possessing or be-.

ing under the influence of alco-
hol while attending any function
off campus which is sponsored

by the college or in which stu-
dents representing the college
are participating.

“IT want to be sure there is no
genuine ignorance about what
the situation is,"" commented
Martin. ‘Restrictions are still
in effect. As long as we have
these regulations, we intend to
enforce them.”

The feelings of several faculty
members concerning the change
voted by the students shortly be-
fore exams was that there would

be little practical change in en-
forcement of any prohibitive re-
strictions.

Dr. Louise Nelson, assistant
professor of economics, com-
mented that the change makes
little difference since there had
never been very much student
enforcement of the drinking rule
except by Honor Court and Stu-
dent Council members.

“Within the bounds of good
taste, I don’t think where the al-
cohol is kept is a question at

all," Miss Nelson commented.
“I do not think it realistic that
students enforce a strict version
of a drinking rule.

“I think,’’ she continued, “‘that
the gentlemanly conduct clause
can cover offenses related to
drinking, and I do think the stu-
dents will enforce the genile-
manly conduct rule.”

“I think it’s a, healthy thing
if the students are going to gov-
ern their affairs that they make
rules they believe in and are

willing to enforce,’’ commented
Dr. Philip Secor, assistant pro-
fessor of political science.

‘On the other hand, I think the
faculty has a right to make rules
governing student ‘conduct,’’ he
added.

“The change which the stu-
dents have made tends to clear
the air; I don't think the ques-
tion of faculty and administra-
tion enforcement will come up
at all unless there are incidents
which embarrass the college,"

Secor concluded.

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts voiced his disappointment
with student repeal of the drink-
ing rule. Commenting that the
rule had been ‘‘a fine part of
student outlook at Davidson,” he
added, ‘‘I don't think the change
will make any practical differ-
ence.”

He stated that some problems
with vandalism resulting from
student drinking have developed,

pointing out that this creates a
conflict concerning whether of-
fenders should be tried by the
Honor Court for destroying col-
lege property or by the faculty
for being under the influence.

Burts said he believes that stu-
dent-leaders should make an at-
tempt to enforce the rule re-
specting damage to college prop-
erty since the referendum was
supposed to express student opin-
ion concerning which rules they
wished enforced.
