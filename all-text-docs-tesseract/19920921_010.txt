Ce Scott energizes the audience with dramatic monologue. The
artist, whose works are on exhibit now in Chambers Gallery, gave a presen-
tation last Wednesday which included this performance, an explanation of
her art, and a question and answer session. She dealt with the issues of
beauty of society, sexism, and racism with severity and a sense of humor.
The event was sponsored by the Art Department.

the greatest etcher of his time, con-
sidered by many to rank among
Rembrandt and Piranesi. He was
the first living artist to have a work
accepted into the collection of the
Louvre Museum. Louvre Policy at
the time was for works of living
artists to be placed in the Luxem-
bourg Museum, and if judged wor-
thy, admitted tothe Louvre 25 years
after the death of the artist. Orr’s

rendition of the Pont Neuf and 10
other French landmarks were ac-
cepted immediately.

Orr is a native of Hartsford,
Connecticut who studied at the
Ecole des Beaux Arts at the turn of

_ the century. Orr was selected by
Louis Orr (1879-1966) was~

the French government to etch the
Centennial Portrait of Louis
Pasteur. His etching of the Na-
tional Capital, commission by Yale
University to honor William

- Howard Taft, was so extraordi-

nary that the State Department
purchased prints to hang in every
one if its embassies worldwide.
Dr. Robert Lee Humber of
Greenville, NC, an international
businessman and graduate of Wake

Forest University and Harvard, met
Orr in Paris. Eventually Humber
induced Orr tocreatea North Caro-
lina series of sketches, and if it
were not for the threat and subse-
quent German invasion of France
in 1940, Humber may not have
been successful.

Louis Orr’s North Carolina
collection took 12 years to pro-
duce. Subjects range from the
Biltmore House in Asheville to the
State Capital in Raleigh, from the
Cupola House in Edenton to
Salisbury’s Community House, A
complete set of Orr’s North Caro-

lina Etchings is part of the Mint —

Museum of Art’s permanent col-
lection.

Movie Critic

Duo Reviews Sneakers

By Will Lazenby and Mary
McCrory

Due to the massive influx of
alcohol-policy related articles re-
cently, we’ve decided to write
about something different: i.e. not
the alcohol policy. We figure,
since you can’t be down on the
courtany old time you please, alot
of you will have plenty of time on
your hands.

Sure, you could be original
and go to the library, but really,
there is only so much exposure to
green carpet a person can take,
And, believe it or not, there are

only so many trips to the Union

one can make before all the snack
food starts to look the same. Every

“once in a while, a person needs to

get out of here.

Short of a junior year abroad,
sometimes your best bet is a pil-
grimage to the Mecca, that is,
Comelius, and the Movies at the
Lake. That’s’where we come in.
We wouldn’t want you to have to
waste your time or money on mov-
ies unworthy of your patronage, so

we'll do it for you. Just call us

martyrs. Instead of going to the
24-hour study room on a Saturday
night, like we normally wouldhave,
we dragged ourselves all the way
to Cornelius to see Sneakers.

The movie boasts a veteran
cast (Robert Redford, Sidney
Poitier, Ben Kingsley, Dan
Aykroyd) which is strengthened
by impressive performances from
a less-experienced trio - River
Phoenix (Mosquito Coast), Mary
McDonnel (Dances with Wolves),
and David Strathairn.

Ashe didin The Natural, Rob-
ert Redford plays a man running
from his past. As Martin Bishop,

Critically

he and his cohorts hire themselves
out to break into highly protected
buildings to test for weak links in
their security systems.

All the trouble’ starts when

.Bishop is confronted by what ap-

pears to be a government agency.
They give himanultimatum: work
for us, or go to jail. His crew goes
along with it, because they need
the money.

So there you have it. After
that, the movie becomes one big
convoluted mass of plot twists.

I personally spent most of the

* movie wishing my last name was

McDonnel, not McCrory. First of
all, Mary McDonnel gets to play «
opposite Robert Redford. As if
that weren’t enough, she gets to
dance with River Phoenix! (To
Aretha’s “Chain of Fools’) Be-
yond her interaction with the other’
characters, McDonnel has a great
part. She plays a tough, intelligent
woman, who isn’t above compas-
sion, andhelps Redford outof some
tough spots.

Will, on the other hand, really
liked. Dan- Aykroyd’s character.
Aykroyd’s cynical digs at Sidney
Poitier’s C.I.A. past provide some
of the funniest dialogues in the
film. For Will, though, it was
David Strathairn’s character who,
with his sightless ingenuity, really
ties the movie together.

We’renot saying this movie is
perfect, as sometimes it moves so
fast, you don’t have time to think
about how infeasible a lot of it is.
But that’s why it is a movie, after
all, and one you should definitely
go see.

P.S. Keep an eye out for a
veteran actor not in the billing...
