PROSPECT FOR ADDITIONAL |

DORMITORY NEARS REALITY |

The plans for the new dormitory have

DAVIDSON MEN TO ATTEND _|
STATE “Y” SRRTERENCE

The annual state meeting of the Y. M.
C. A. will be held this year in Greens-
boro, February 14th and 15th. Preceding |
this meeting, a conference of employed |
officers will be held, following it the con-
ference of student delegates. This last
meeting will be the one of special inter-
est to Davidson men.

The main purpose of this annual meet-
ing is to hear and approve the annual
report of the State Committee. Another
important purpose is to get each depart-
ment of the whole Y. M. C. A. organiza-
tion to see the work of the other depart-
ments and to learn the work of the en-
tire organization. At the meeting will
be representatives from the following
classes of “Y” associations: railroad, in-
dustry, county, city, boys’ work, and
student.

There will be speakers from several
eastern states. Cleveland, O.; Atlanta,
Ga.; New York City and Lynchburg, Va.,
will be among the cities represented by
speakers at the conference. North |
Carolina will be represented by two of}
her college presidents, Dr. H. E. Rond-
thaler, president of Salem College, and)
Dr. W. A. Harper, president of Elon
College. |

At the conclusion of the State Confer-
ence the Student Conference will be
held. Our Davidson Secretary, Dwight |
Chalmers, planned this meeting in his
capacity as State Student Secretary. Da- |
vidson’s delegates to this
were elected by the Junior Class and are |

conference

been practically completed, and with the
letting of the contract, which may take)
place any day now, the work will begin |
on the structure. This dormitory will |
be modeled along the latest designs for
college buildings and will differ some-|
what from any now on the campus. It)
will be four stories high with a base-|
ment in addition, and the front will re-|
sembly old Chambers to the extent that |
four columns support the roof. Only in|
the front rooms of the first story will |
there be running water and lavatories in|
the individual rooms. The second, third
and fourth stories will all be alike, with
a common lavatory designed somewhat
like the present ones in Rumple, but in
a larger room about half way between
the front and rear on each hall. The
heating and lighting of the rooms will
be similar to the system now in use, and
each room will have two closets, placed
side by side as are those in Georgia and
Watts. |

This new dormitory will be the largest
of the four, containing over 70 rooms,
and built east of Georgia, will add a great
deal to the attractiveness of dormitory
row and to the impressiveness of the
campus as a whole.
