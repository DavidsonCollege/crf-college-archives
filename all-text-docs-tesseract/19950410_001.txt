Campaign for Davidson meets

Crosland donates $1 million

By ASHLYN DANNELLY
Staff writer

When Davidson began its am-
bitious $150 million Campaign for
Davidson in 1989, many people
expressed skepticism that the col-
lege had set its.sights too high.

Charlotte businessman. John
Crosland was one of those skep-
tics. He says, “When I first heard
of the campaign ... I wondered
whether they would be able to reach
the goal or not.”

On Friday, Davidson Presi-
dent John Kuykendall announced
to the college’s Board of Visitors
that Crosland’s one million dollar
gift to the school had put the Cam-
paign past its goal, nearly three

months before the June 30 dead-
line.

Crosland’s contribution will
go toward creating an endowed
professorship, the thirteenth en-
dowed chair of the Campaign.

Crosland, a 1951 Davidson
graduate, says, “I think Davidson
is blessed by having some excel-
lent teachers. I am glad to play a
part in attracting and keeping these
excellent teachers.”

In his address to the Board of
Visitors, Kuykendall said, “It’s a
remarkable thing for [Crosland’s]
gift to be the one to carry us past
our goal.”

Earlier in the meeting,
Crosland had been elected chair of
the Board of Visitors for the next

year.

Crosland is chairman of the
board of The Crosland Group, Inc.,
areal estate development concern.
He is also a director of the Char-
lotte Chamber of Commerce, First
Union National Bank, and Presby-
terian Hospital. He serves as a
trustee for the Central. Piedmont
Community College Foundation
and Episcopal High School, as well

as chairman for the Charlotte Habi-.

tat for Humanity.

Crosland says the Crosland
Professorship will “probably be
something in the math field, or
something related. John
[Kuykendall] and I will sit down

PCC not to charge
independents

By RAnpy HARTWELL
& MATTHEW EirIcu
Staff writer & Asst. News Editor

The debate over charging in-
dependents to attend Court parties
raged throughout the week. The
debate was further confused on
Sunday night when the Patterson
Court Council (PCC) voted six to
four not to charge independents to
attend Court parties for the 1995-
96 school year.

On Tuesday at the SGA meet-
ing, Patterson Court President
Steven Shames, Union President
Morgan Perry, and Patterson Court
Advisor Kurt Holmes defended the

proposal and answered questions.
Independent senators found their
phones “ringing off the hook as
soon as the last issue of The
Davidsonian came,” wrote outgo-
ing head independent senator and
new junior senator Saad Gul in his
official e-mailed statement to The
Davidsonian. Holmes and other
people connected to the Court also
found their phone lines jammed
with calls about the proposal.
Some PCC officers defended
the plan. Because of the small size
of the campus, the PCC decided it
had to find a’ way to include as
