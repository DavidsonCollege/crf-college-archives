Enrollment Increase Must Wait

Today marks the first anniversary of
the Trustees’ fateful decision to increase
the enrollment of Davidson to 1000 with-
in the next few years. This action virtual-
ly ignored strong and oft expressed facul-
ty and student opinion opposing expan-
sion.

To implement this program, the Trus-
tees left behind a few general and happily
ambiguous sentences specifying that the
college facilities would be adequately pre-
pared to meet the increase before the
gradual inching upward began.

In the year that has elapsed since last
February 15. the motives behind the
frustees’ edict have been the topic for
widespread campus discussion. Many
think, and not without basis, that the
move. was not completely based on a feel-
ing of Davidson’s Altruistic duty to do her
part in absorbing the impending flood:
of students scheduled to hit American
higher education in the immediate future,
as was implied at the time.

Hopes of getting Davidson into big-
time athletics, the difficulty experienced
at times by alumni in getting their sons
accepted here, and the sentiment that
Davidson is already over-selective and too
stiff academically—all are rumored to
have been behind the Trustees’ decision.

But all of this is water over the dam:
The important thing is that Davidson at
present is not ready to expand her enroll-
ment. It is of crucial importance that the
Trustees realize this and understand why.

To increase the size of the student
body now could only mean the forfeiting
of the calibre of education offered here.

At the present time, the general im-
pression to the contrary, Davidson is un-
able to secure sufficient students who
meet her standards and specifications,
and who are able to do the work re-
quired. Superficially, this is in contradic-

tion with the figures which are inevita-
bly paraded out to prove the institution’s
selectivity: over 700 applications and only.
240 entering in this year’s freshman class.
But these figures camouflage the truth.

By the time the incompleted applica-
tions are subtracted, along with a sizé-
able group who are immediately accepted
here, but decline in favor of other schools,
the bare facts show that of the applicants
from whom Davidson can take her pick,
only around 150 are actually rejected,
while 250 or so are admitted.

Last year, the-Admissions Committee,
in order to fill the quota for the present
freshman class, was forced to accept. a
good number of applicants who were ad-
mittedly borderline cases and definitely
poor admissions risks.

And now, out of a group of 36 fresh-
men not making minimum progress to-
ward graduation (24 hours and 18 quality
points; after the first semester, approxi-
mately half are cases which were known
from the outset to have doubtful qualifi-
cations. This group must make minimum
progress toward graduation before the
end of summer school, in order to be
eligible for re-admission in the fall.

Accepting boys known to be in for
rough sledding and possible eventual aca-
demic exclusion is grossly unfair, and a
real disservice. both to the boy and to
Davidson. ¢

The folly of admitting more students
at the present time is plain, on these
grounds alone. And there are other ob-
vious factors, with which we shall deal
at a later date.

We call these facts to the attention
of the Trustees, and ask that no move
be made to up the enrollment until Da-
vidson reaches the place where she can
draw sufficient applicants to fill the
present quotas with students who can
handle the work required.

Winter Services Missed Mark-Why?

A ringing telephone shattered both
the silence and the dedicated work of a
planning committee two days before the
Winter Services when Dr. Eugene Carson
Blake called to say that he would not be
able to come to Davidson.

Dr. John Whale saved the reeling com-
mittee from a difficult situation by agree-
ing, with only two days notice, to bring
two additional addresses. This, of neces-
sity, over-balanced the week and upset the
planning of a twelve month period.

The point of real concern is not in the
mechanics of change. The fact is that the
week, in terms of overall student re-
sponse, was far from a success. In short,
it did not “catch hold” and bring the stu-
dent body to grips with the proposed
questions.

Those who have expended time and
talents in preparation for this week and
who had hoped and prayed for a pro-
foundly moving week are now in the pro-
cess of asking themselves an inescapable
WHY?

Why indeed? There was a blend of one
outstanding English theologian, one
American seminary professor, and one
person experienced in student contact.
Each of them had an opportunity to speak
on subjects selected by Davidson students
and each was given time for personal con-
tact.

Was it really because the speakers
were above our heads? Was it because
they did not prepare their messages in
the context of our interests?

Perhaps this was part of the problem.
Yet we complain when the men of the
cloth give us “spiritual pablum.” There
is some sentiment, though small in num-
ber, that Dr. Whale in particular gave
new scope and majesty to the Christian

gospel and met intellectual argument with
intellectual proof.

If we are completely candid in our
analysis, won't we have to admit that a
good portion of the guilt lies on us? Isn’t
it true that we have become so accus-
tomed to neat religious formulas that we
actually resent being called upon to use
our minds in respect to matters of the
heart?

Was the outward failure of this week
the fault of the speakers, poor planning
on the part of the committee, or was it
an indictment of a form of spiritual decay
on our own part. It is a question all of us
need to answer honestly.—F.L.H.

Another Notch
For Progress

Campus reaction to the Fa¢ulty’s long-
awaited decision to alter the basis for
awarding the arts and science degrees
was generally enthusiastic.

It is interesting to note that the mo-
tion finally adopted was in essence identi-
cal to that submitted to the Faculty by
the Curriculum Committee in January.
After an earlier defeat and countless
other proposals and counter-proposals,
the original plan came back to be adopted
Tuesday afternoon.

We are thankful that the matter was
not pigeon-holed indefinitely as it once
appeared destined to be. The Faculty is
to be roundly applauded for their ability
to compromise and pass a proposal ac-
ceptable to everyone involved, insofar as
was possible.

(Having presented the male
outicok on this sort of thing
for dance weekends on end,
we decided to hear from the
Davidson man’s date, since she
precipitated all this chaos in
the first place.

The Davidsonian this week

torialist, who is a long-time
veteran observer of the vener-
able Davidson Dance Week-
end.—The Editors)

It rains! that is the first and
foremost fact for a girl to remem-
ber about a Davidson dance week-
end! Of course, this means that
in the long trek from Belk to the
Gym you wilt doubtless ruin
those fabulous white satin shoes
and the hem of that brand-new
dream of a dress that you bought
especially for this occasion.

Through it all, however, you
must remember to smile and act
as though it really doesn’t matter
at all. (And don’t forget to bring
an extra supply of spray-net!)

When your date comes to
get you, he will no doubt give
wey to sundry facial grimaces
which will lead you to think
that he has gotten a coat-

Desperate Freshman Gets
Tangled In Rooming Rule

Dear Editor:

I'm desperate! You are my last
hope.

Being a freshman, I'm sort of
confused, I think, about keeping
dates in Belk on dance weekends—
at any rate I now stand to lose my
date and get kicked out of school
if you can’t help me.

Ut met her, my date that is,
fest summer. | gave her my
high school letter sweater and
gold football and she said she
loved me but now she goes
to Hollins and | don’t know if
she does or doesn’t.

My big problems started when
my big brother said she could stay
in his room in Belk. When they
announced these different regula-
tions he said that I shouldn’t worry
eause he had a great idea that
would beat the new system.

I still don't know exactly what
happened, but from the ten letters
from Dean Spencer, the four from
Mrs. Little, the visits from Bunny
Perkinson, and the note in gold

ink from Dr. Cunningham, ]’ve sort
of gathered that they don't like
the slick deal my big brother tried
to pull to get me a room before
everyone else.

T’ve been told also that the Exec-
utive Committee is taking the mat-

Perplexed?

ter urider advisement and will re-
port to the faculty shortly. In addi-
tion Dad has been told to come
to Davidson with an empty trunk.
Evidently something has gone

wrong.

All the letters say, in difter-
ent words of course, that if
he (that is my big brother)
doesn’t stay with the girl he’s
signed up for (that is my date)
the whole weekend they will
kick me out of school—they
also said something about «
three doller fine as { leave.

Dr. Cunningham said in his note
that he would personally have Cop
Linker check the ball field both
nights and that if my girl wasn’t
parking with my big brother they'd
kick me out of school for violating
the Honor Code. And also Perkin-
son said “they'd damned well bet-
ter be pinned”. or he'd stick the
Student Council on me.

It’s been a long time since I’ve
run into this type of situation and
TI don’t know what I should do.
Can you help me?

Dear Perplexed:

No, but drop us a line from

Grand Entrance

Now for the grand entrance!
Gathering your self-confidence
about you, you descend the stairs,
a vision of loveliness and poige,
only to be thrown into a state of
complete panic by the sea of

masculinity staring at you from be-
low!

After aggressively elbowing
your way through the masses, you
eventually happen upon your date
over in the corner, and you are
off to the dance! Or so you think!
It seems inevitable that he has
forgotten to get either his tuck
shirt or studs out of his room, and
you must run back upstairs for
him.

it is while rumaging around
in his closets that you come
face to face with the greatest
temptation of the week-end.
No, you must not read those
letters tucked away in his
drawer nor question him about
the picture in the closet—it
is probably his sister, anyway!

Having met all the little emer-
gencies, you finally get to the
dance—just in time for intermis-
sion. This means that you are

bundled up again and rushed off

to the fraternity house where you
will be called upon to perform
amazing feats of co-ordination in-
volving the balancing of a cup
of coffee in one hand and a sticky
doughnut and napkin in the other,
all while trying to disentangle
yourself from the person next to

you.

Following this period of relaxa-
tion and fellowship, you are again
hustled off to the gym for one last
dance before being deposited once

more at Belk with instructions to
be ready in five minutes.

Half an hour later you again
descend the stairs to be greeted by
a silent group of newspapers with
legs sticking out from under them.
Having discovered under which
newspaper your date is sleeping,
you revive him and together you
go out into the soggy, wet night
to play the game commonly known
as the survival of the fittest!

Several hours and untold ex-
periences later, you oid your
date a fond, but drowsy, good-
night — or rather good-morn-
ing — and feel your way up-
stairs. One thought and one
only is uppermost in your
weary brain — sleep!

Dear Dates of Davidsonians:

You fortunate few of the femi-
nine gender should be honored to
be escorted on the Hill this week
by the legendary Davidson Gentle-
men. It’s amazing the amount of
change that you can make around
this place. _

For instance, the editor of this
page gives me instructions that this
week for the column I should write
chatter containing a lot of names
and personalities that will interest
you.

What should | say? Should I tell
you not to get alarmed if you
see another girl's name listed as
your beloved’s date on the Belk
rooming chart? It’s very easily ex-
plained. You see, the IFC made us
sign up with our date’s name a
week in advance. Understanding
these Presbyterian’s inclination to
procrastination, you should realize
that your date may have had to
make up a fictitious name on Mon-
day before he asked you for the
date on Thursday. Don’t fall into
the vicious suspicion that his first
date shafted him at the last min-
ute so he drafted you.
