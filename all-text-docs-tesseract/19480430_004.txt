WHY... 1 smoke Chesterfield

( FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENTS BY PROMINENT TOBACCO FARMERS )

Liggett & Myers buy top quality cigarette tobacco
and pay top prices for it... nobody will average
paying more than they do year in and year out.
I’ve been smoking Chesterfields ever since I’ve
been smoking. I just like them... they have real

tobacco flavor. fi liaemen
