Sets January
For Program Climax

Leon Uris, author of the recent best-selling novel Exodus, has accepted an
invitation to appear here at Davidson College. He will participate in the second
of a series of programs initiated last year by Vance Packard and The Status Seekers.
These programs feature outstanding and controversial books and bring their authors

this project.”

He then announced two in-
novations concerning the , over-
all program. The series is to
be held annually only and will
be called the Book-of-the-Year
Program. In addition, Dr. Max
Polley, Professor of Bible, will
act as faculty adviser to the
program. Faculty support will
thus encourage the Book-of-the-
Year Program.

Acting upon his committee's
decision to feature a contem-
porary novel, Robinson cor-

Cole Praises

Rush Week,

Exhorts Better Regulations

The IFC termed the 1960 Freshman Rush Week a
“great success” after its evaluation meeting Monday

night with all the fraternity

“I personally thought every-
thing went very well except for
the frantic mixup in mailing
bids Saturday morning,” said
Jerry Cole, IFC president. “I
want to express my apprecia-
tion to the rush chairman and
IFC members for the splendid
job they did.”

Several factors in the Rush
Week program will be changed
as a result of the evaluation.
Two of these involve the length
of time fraternity men can rush
freshmen,

“During the next rush week,
the IFC will enforce end of
rushing at 10:15 p. m. each
night outside the dorms,” Cole
said. “There was too much ling-
ering after parties this year.”

The other move affects the
15 minute gentleman's agree-
ment on dorm rushing. Though
they realized this rule was

rush chairman.

broken, chairmen felt there was
such an improvement over last
year, that it could be excused.
A closer watch will be made
on this agreement in the fu-
ture, however.

In order to prevent another
mailing mixup, the various fra-
ternities will deliver their seal-
ed bids to the IFC president
during future rush weeks. He
will then deliver all the bids
to the postman early on the
morning of pledging and keep
a duplicate list of names as a
double check.

“One other worthwhile sug-
gestion from Monday's meeting
was for the IFC to keep some-
one by a definite phone all
rush week to answer any ques-
tions by rushers or rushees and
quickly solve any problems
which might arise,” Cole ex-
plained.

with leading publishing houses
asking for suggestions of new
or forthcoming novels suitable
for such a program. From the
many suggestions received,’
Exodus was the first choice
Second choice was SEASON |
OF FEAR by Guy Owen, a
former Professor of Philoso- |
phy ef Davidson College,
which is a story of integration |
and interracial turmoil in
western North Caroljna and |
an appeal for an intelligent
understanding of the South's
problem in its attempt to in-
tegrate the Negro into pre-
sentry Southern society.

James Warburg's Reveille Fer |
Rebels, which presents a chal- |
lenge to modern Americans to
investigate their relationship to |
the other peoples of the world |
and is a speculative interpre-|
tation of America’s future po-|
litical and economic role in|
world affairs, was the third
choice.

The program will center
around Uris’ novel, which tells
the story of the mass immigra-
tion of the Jewish people out
of the ghettos of eastern Europe
and from the centuries-old pre-
judice of western Europe and
America into the newly-found-
ed state of Israel, and Exedus
Revisited, a pictorial and fac-
tual complement to the fiction-
alized story.

Uris presents a vivid pic-
ture ef Jewish persecution
from its Medieval origins
down to the present and one
which is backed by extensive
research and travel through
eastern Europe and israel.

Dean Johnston said that the

for some time the possibility
of having comprehensives. He
stated that a list of questions
was given to the faculty last
Spring which included a re-
quest for faculty reaction to
the question of comprehensives.

“Davidson has come to de-

in a lot of cramming. This is

in the near future regarding

pose of our yisits will be pri-
