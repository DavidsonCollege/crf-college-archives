The New Regime

As the masthead undergoes its yearly
face lifting this week, it seems appropriate
and necessary to begin with a few words
on expected policy for the remainder of
this year.

In the editorial platforms presented
here two weeks ago, there were many
ideas, and proposed changes. Due to the
nature of these suggestions and the new
staff, many of these journalistic jaunts
must be takén gradually without expecta-
tion of fulfillment until next year.

The policy for the remainder of this
year will be one of flexible experimenta-
tion and exploration. Your ideas, com-
ments, and constructive ‘criticisms are
welcomed and expected. Our offices will
be open every Wednesday evening from
7 to 10 P.M. The sports staff is located in
the charter room, the editorial board is
in the student government room, and the

managerial office in its usual confusion .

at the end of that hall.

In keeping with the atmospheric condi-
tions produced by Spring Frolics week-
end, this edition is presented in a light
vein with the exception of the trustee’s
report. It is hoped, however, that careful
consideration will be given to these min-
utes from the trustees’ meeting. Subsidi-
zation has long been the subject of much
concern to students and faculty and such
a report should remove ‘assumed knowl-
edge” and provide the basis for student
opinion based upon fact.

Plaudits For The Military

In spite of demerits, inspections, and
peon critics, there is something good to
be said for that group of some 430 stu-
dents and instructors collectively called

ROTC. Last week after the thorough Fed- .

eral Inspection Agents pulled away and
scraggly beards began to appear; there
was sent to Colonel Sapp a properly titled
copy of the inspection report which went
also to 3rd Army headquarters. Specifical-
ly it read, “Superior on weapons, superior
on classrooms, superior on regimental
staff briefing . . .” totaling an overall
superior rating. Included among other
very complimentary remarks was the
statement by all three inspecting colonels
that Davidson was the most outstanding
school that they had inspected this year.
As far as is known, these are the most
favorable comments and the first overall

superior rating received in the history of .

ROTC at Davidson.

Now it is recognized by cadet and
eadre authority that the sole function of
ROTC is not to post a superior rating on
the battalion masthead for inspirational
purposes. It is a significant distinction,
however, that such a culminating ap-
praisal was earned and obtained.

In great measure, credit for this rat-
ing is due to the overall training program
established by the PMS&T. This program
is centered in student control, responsi-
bility, and action which in a very real
sense compliments the overall faculty
policy of this year. It can be said with no
reservations that the actions of ROTC
this year have been planned, approved,
and conducted by cadets.

This system has had its very obvious
effects. Positive student response is evi-
denced by the attitude shown to officers
on the drill field, cleaning of weapons,
and most emphatically by the increased
number of sophomores applying for ad-
vanced ROTC. The administration has
shown enthusiasm by being represented
at all cadet regimental briefings and by
personal request for a briefing delivered
to the entire faculty.

All visiting army officials have de-
livered their commendations to the cadets.
General Cleland even sent a personal let-
ter of approval to the cadet regimental
staff. Spectators have heartily praised
ROTC parades and the static displays at
Homecoming and freshman-parent’s day.

To all of the spit-shines, polished
rifles, and rolls of red tape, then, a 21-gun
salute for a job well done.

Trustees’ Official Statement On
Athletic Subsidization Revealed

(The College Board of Trustees,
at the request of ODK, has given
permission to the Davidsenian to
publish an excerpt from the min-
utes of the trustees’ meeting of
May 28, 1954, which deals with the
trustees’ recommendations on the
currently controversial issue of
athletic subsidization.

(The following except is the en-
tire and uncut record of the trus-
tees’ action on this question. —Ed.)

The joint committee of the
Trustees and Faculty on the Ath-
letic Policy of the College made
the following report, which was
unanimously adopted as amended.
The report is as follows:

Amended report. of Athletic
Committee:

Section 1. Present Athletic Policy.

L. Polley.

Recognizing the many educa-
tional values of physical education
as an integral part of the total
educative process, we reaffirm our
conviction that a program of Inter-
collegiate Athletics and Physical
Education is a valid and valuable
part of the total educational pro-
gram of Davidson College. We af-
firm that the objectives of the
athletic program are:

a. To provide physical as well
as spiritual and mental develop-
ment as a part of an integrated
program;

b. To provide 4 sufficient range
of athletic activities to attain maxi-
mum student participation;

c. To provide opportunity for
students to achieve recognition for
outstanding athietic performance
in some sport; ,

d. To give proper expression to
the innate desire of students for
athletic competition and to de-
velop the true spirit of sportsman.
ship; and

e. To serve as a means for
deepening and expressing thot in-
tangible but real quality known as
college spirit, and for promoting
the interest and loyalty of students
and friends of the College.

I. Organization

In order to achieve these gaals
and implement this policy, the or-
ganizational structure shall be as
follows:

a. <A separate department,
known as the Department of Stu-
dent Health, under the super-
vision of the College Physician;
and

b. A department of Physical
Education and Athletics under the
supervision of the Director of Ath.
letics, this department to function
as any other department of the
College.

1. Control

a. The Trustees shall exercise
the same general supervision and
direction of these departments as
they do of the other departments
of the College, and appropriate
committees of the Trustees shall
continue to represent them in
supervising the work of both the
Department of Student Health and
the Department of Physical Edu-
cation and Athletics. The College
Physician, the Director of Athletics
and the members of the coaching
staffs shall be elected by the Trus-
tees, upon the recommendation of
the President and the Dean of the

Faculty.

b. The President and the Facul-
ty shall have the responsibility of
implementing the policy and shall
exercise control of the intercol-
legiate athletics, this control to
include such items as scheduling,
eligibility standards, the awarding
of scholarships, the number of in-
tercollegiate contests to be played
and the number of days teams may
be absent from the campus. The
faculty will continue, as in the
past, to elect a Faculty Committee
on Athletics, which will represent
the faculty in matters pertaining
to athletics. The recommendations
of the Director of Athletics and
the head coaches in the various
sports will receive careful con-
sideration in matters pertaining to
the areas of their particular re-
sponsibility. .

Nothing in the above statement
is to alter the fact that the Presi-
dent of the College is charged with
general oversight of the athletic
program, as of all the instruction
and discipline of the College and
that by virtue of such fact, he
shall be recognized as occupying
the place of primary responsibility
in this area also.

ec. An Athletic Council is to be
composed of the following: three
members from the Alumni Asso-
ciation, the Faculty Committee on
Athletics, the Committee on Ath-
letics of the Trustees, and two
student members elected by the
student body. The Director of
Athletics shall be an ex-officio
member of the Council and the
Council shall determine its own
Chairman, Secretary, and the time
of meeting, which shall not be less
than semi-annually. The Council
shall be an advisory body to the
President and the Trustees of the
College and shall serve as a
medium whereby both may be-
come more fully acquainted wth
the opinions of alumni, students,
and friends of the College. It
may submit recommendations con-
cerning the type of schedule played
by college teams, the number of
intercollegiate contests to be
played in any sport, the choice of
coaching personnel and other ap-
propriate phases of the Physical
Education and Athletic program.
So long as the present athletic
policy of the College continues in
effect, it shall encourage the sup-
port given athletics through the
Wildcat Clubs and may also make
recommendations concerning the
awarding of grants-in-aid to ath-
letes within the limits of funds
available for the purpose, and sub-
ject to the rules of any athletic
conference or association to which
the College belongs. Its recom-
mendations in these areas shall
not be binding but shall always
receive careful consideration by
the constituted authorities of the

_ College.

IV. Athletic Grants

Subject to the principles stated
hereafter, the College shall con-
tinue to award such athletic grants
as may seem wise and necessary
in the light of the total needs of
the institution.

a. Recipients shall be selected

~~

on the basis of secondary school
records which show:

1. Outstanding character and
desirable qualities of personality
and leadership.

2. Academic competence.

3. Athletic achievement and
promise.

b. Amount of Stipend.

Depending on the demonstrated
need of the candidate, the amount
of the award may range from a
small grant to a figure equivalent
to tuition, fees, room, board and
books. This shall be within the
limitations of the prescribed
policies of the conference or asso-
ciation to which we may be re
lated.

c. Like all other scholarships
and grants at Davidson, athletic
grants will be awarded on an an-
nual basis. It shall, however, be
the policy of the College to renew
such grants from year to year prg-
vided that:

1. The conduct of the recipient
is satisfactory; and

2 The recipient makes satisfac-
tory progress towards graduation,
both qualitatively and quantitative-
ly, in accordance with the stan-
dards required of recipients of
grants-in-aid and remissions from
the General Fund of the College.

d. Recipients of athletic grants
shall be selected by the Faculty
Committee on Scholarships and
Loans on the recommendation of
the coaches concerned.

e. This program of athletic
grants is to be financed by the
College from such funds as may
properly be used for that purpose.
The amount to be used is to be
determined by the Trustees or the
Executive Committee after the sub-
mission of recommendations by the
President and the Finance Com-
mittee.

Sec Il. Proposed Athletic Policy.

We recommend to the Trustees
that they authorize the President
of the College to solicit and en-
courage a selected group of at least
six colleges and universities to
join with us in promoting a pro-
gram looking toward the abolish-
ing of subsidized athletics (that is,
athletic scholarships as such) at
the earliest possible date.

In order that the President of
the College may understand the
degree of authority given him
under this recommendation, we
would agree that the principles
adopted by the Ivy Group indicate
the general type of agreement to
be desired.

Respectfully submitted,
J. McDowell Richards,
President of the Trustees.
John R. Cunningham,
President of the College.

The Welcome Mat:

Davidson Primer For
Neophyte Frolickers

By JIMMY MARTIN

(Since many of you lovely young
ladies dre visiting our campus for
the first time, the Social Progress
Committee in conjunction with the
Cheluba Traveler’s Aid Society of-
fers as a public service this timely,
informative article in an effort to
enlighten you as to our local cus-
toms, traditions, history, and scenic
wonders.— Ed.)

Davidson College began its role
of “molding” young Southern man-
hood about 110 years ago, and has
existed for as many years since
as a predominantly male institu-
tion, because the founding fathers
didn’t consult the mothers. Al-
though supported by the Presby-
terian Church (US.), its enrollment
has been more or less Associate-
Reformed-Metho-Bapt-erian.

For an appropriate motto and
seal the founders hired one Peter
Stewart Ney, a local itinerant
school teacher who had deserted
Napoleon’s army just before Water-
loo. He brought with him Napo-
leon’s favorite chandelier, a copy
of Desiree’s favorite earrings, and
it may be seen today in the old
Ney homestead preserved in mem-
ory of that great philanthropist.
Ney's chosen seal was a sword of
vengeance slaying the coiled snake,
symbol of the roommate who wasn’t
satisfied with his own blind date
(later sources suggested ‘that the
sword was purple originally, and
actually wasn’t a sword, but a
spear—no motif was proposed
however). Ney also composed the
classical motto: “Lind? Looks
Sorta Libertous” (obsolete mean-
ing) with subscript motto,
“Ney’s Ulcer.” Ney was buried in
the cornerstone of the principal
structure along with quite a large
sum of Confederate money stolen
from share-cropping tycoon Max-
well Chambers, whose vision was
as faulty as his father’s.

During the War Between the
States, our Davidson was the only
Southern college that couldn't get
its rusty doors closed, and the
classical columns were used as
hitching posts for the Confederate
KAvalry unit, which exists to this
day as a sub rosa organization
easily recognizable by the fungus
on their faces.

Imminent in the history of our
school was the expulsion of a

“Bumenean Uber Alles!” set fire
to the old Chambers building, be-
cause there “wasn’t enough cham-
bers to go around.” He further,

by becoming President of the US.
and A.

Yea, verily, Davidson's heritage
has been a glorious one. And its
present physical plant attests the
splendor of its early years. Just
enst of the historic meeting house
(designed in 1780 by Cash Jackson)
stands an imposing structure which
comprises the Davidson College
Museum of Natural and Tradition-
al History. In its priceless collec-
tions are to be found such articles
as an old letter, a Ouija board, two
Barlow knives, a Piece of String,
some out-dated study lamps and
a lot of books (of which we are
very proud).

On the opposite side of the cam-
pus behind the men’s dormitories
is the nearly completed ROTC
building with quarters for both of-
ficers and enlisted men. Ask your
date to put on his soldier suit so
you can watch him march. Then
maybe he will take you on a tour
of our 36-bench golf course, or to
the Saturday night submarine
taces. What funt

Be sure to visit the Johnson
Family Gymnasium. Courses are
offered here in outdoor ballet,
primeval art, evil art, and water
hockey, with a lab course in weight
iifting for prospective beach-bums.
We have a modern set of monkey
bars with a 850-monkey capacity
(no drinks served after midnight).
Come and see!

Thus is Davidson. Will you re-
call that the first ecstatic glimpse
of our traditional campus this aft-
ernoon, with the traditional sun
shining brightly through our tradi-
tional trees? Or if it was raining
you really didn’t notice it, because
your blind date turned out to be
such a jewel of a guy, and the
weekend holds great promise. Or
if not, it has been such a pleasant
afternoon reading the funny stories
in Seripts ‘n Pranks that nothing
else seemed to matter. And if that
didn’t come through either, just
forget the whole cotton-picking
mess.

Gragg’s “Humble Criticism” Blasted

Dear Editor:

We wish to take this opoprtunity
to congratulate Mr. Gragg on his
fine article in last week’s issue,
particularly his remarks about Mr.
Mauze. We feel that Mr. Gragg
showed an admirable Christian at-
titude in attacking the candidate
who had already been defeated.

Mr. Gragg stated that “Mr. Mauze
reached new heights in half-truths
and ‘white lies’,” and we would say
that Mr. Gragg has reached new
depths in humble criticism.

Mr. Gragg seems to think that
students should not have personal
invitations to work with the YMCA;
we would remind him that our
Lord Jesus Christ gave personal
invitations to those who became
aides in the greatest religious
movement the world has ever
known.

“It is inconceivable’ to Mr.
Gragg “how a rational student
could vote for’ Mr. Mauze, and
it is inconceivable to us how the
Davidsenten can continue to pub-
lish such tripe, week after week
(except, of course, as a necessary

_ space-filler).

We recognize the fact, however,
that we, mere humble students,
are not qualified to judge the lit-
erary masterpieces of Mr. Gragg,
who has had untold experience in
the socia)l and political life of the
campus. He has had, perhaps, a
better “bird’s eye view” than any

other student.

We are filled with wonder and
awe and when we think of the
strong, brave, courageous men
(ike Mr. Gragg) who are constant-
ly working to promulgate Christian
principles through kind thought,
word, and deed to their fellow-
men, M.D. S..,

Better, Not
Bigger Davidson

Dear Editor:

In the latest issue of The Chris-
tlen Century an article by Joseph
M. Hopkins (p. 472) has this to say
with respect to the proper size for
the student body of a “small col-
lege:"

“A recent survey undertaken by
Hamilton College, financed by
Ford and Carnegie grants, con-
cluded that the ideal college size
is 7850 students. Below that num-
ber, overhead per student is high
and operation therefore inefficient.
To go beyond that figure, in the
judgment of the researchers, would
be ‘to risk certain personalized
small college values.’ If small size
is desirable for liberal arts pur-
poses, it is even more desirable
for the purposes of Christian de-
velopment, and consequently
should be a sine qua non for
church-related colleges.”

Union Post Office?

Controversial issues at Davidson are
frequently so intimately associated with
other’ matters of dispute that they may
not be considered on their own merits,
It is the opinion of the writer that the
question of establishing a post office in
the College Union building, a live issue
two years ago, was the victim of an anti-
administration and anti-Union feeling
caused by the freshmen eating status.

Now that events have shown that the
requirement to have freshmen eat in
the College Union cafeteria during the
first semester was not the fraternity-killer
that zealous prophets foresaw, perhaps
the post office question can be raised
with more hope of objective consideration.

An obvious advantage in having a post
office located in the Union building is
convenience. The fraternities seemingly
have been willing to forget the hostilities
of two years ago, and have come more
and more to rely on the Union as a stu-
dent center. Student offices are located
there, the Snack Bar and the Student
Store are Union services, and extra-curri-
cular events tend t6 gravitate to the
Union.

A Union post office would be a major
step toward making the Union the true
center of student activities. It would add
one more centralized service to the many
already being offered.

A second consideration would be
economy. The discontinuing of “cut
cards” has removed some of the force
this argument had: two years ago, but it
is still one of the major factors. Under
a possible set-up, all communication with-
in the college, including the inter-student
exchanges, , administration-student com-
munication, and organizational corre-
spondence to members, would be distrib-
uted without the payment of postage
which is now necessary.

When the proposal was originally
made, a flat rate rental of 50 cents per
semester per box was suggested. At that
time, the rate would have been less than
60 cents per quarter rate paid at
the local post office. Since then, U.S.
rentals have been increased to 90 cents
per quarter, and the College Union rental
fee would result in a considerable saving
to the student.

A third consideration would be the
creation of new jobs for student workers.
In a town the size of Davidson, it would
be impossible to have the United States
Post Office open a branch at the college,
but it is estimated that two students work-
ing part-time could adequately handle the
quantity of mail which would pass
through the Union office. Salaries for
these men would be taken from the rental
fees and the savings resulting from the
postage-less college communication.

Space is admittedly at a premium in
the Union at this time. A proposed bowl-
ing alley had to be sacrificed for storage
space when the building was reworked.
The most probable location of a post of-
fice would be in the ping pong recreation

room in the southwest corner of the lower
floor.

This area could be given up without
much damage to student life, for ping
pong tables are standard equipment in
the fraternity houses, and the activity
would simply be shifted to the houses.

The advantages of a Union post office

- Seem to over-ride the objections, and the

writer urges student, faculty, and admin-
istration discussion of the matter to ar-
rive at a definite opinion.

Perhaps the students do not want a
separate post office—only time will tell
the answer. The point is that no action
has been taken since 1953. At that time,
six fraternities voted for, and five voted
against the service. It was felt then that
the decision was not decisive enough for
action. It is the purpose of this article
to revive interest in and discussion of an
important, though seemingly dead, issue.
