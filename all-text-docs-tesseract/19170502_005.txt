ATTENTION !

Here is a question that 1 would like
to ask, and if any one can answer it, ]
will be only too glad: Is it best for all
concerned for students to correct papers:
lf the professor writes out the correct
answer so that it will be a guide to the
student who corrects the papers, the
student can only go by that one fixed set
of answers, not being able to make any
allowance at any place. The student
does not know what was taught in the
class room, and altho he may have taken
the course in the past, and thinks that
he knows what was brought out on
class, too often makes a mistake, as the
professor never follow a set plan of
teaching, emphasizing this year what he
only mentioned last year. Lf, on a re-
view, questions are not answered just as
the student who corrects the papers
thinks that it was taught the vear be-
fore, whereas it may be exactly what
was taught and emphasized this year, the
one correcting the papers marks off just
because it was not as he thought that it
was brought out on class, and as it most
probably was taught the year he took
the course. On the other hand, if the
professor himself corrects the review pa-
pers, he knows exactly what he brought
out and emphasized in the class room.
and, if there are any allowances to be
imade, he knows just how and where to
make them.

Take Bible, for instance: A set of
correct answers are given to the student
who grades the papers, and he has no
alternative than to go exactly by those
answers. In many instances, the answer

‘written on the review paper is a suffi-
‘cient and satisfactory answer; but it ts

not just the same as is given in the set
made out by the professor, nor in’ ex-
actly the same words. All that the
student can do who is correcting the
papers is to mark that answer wrong;
whereas if the professor had had the
paper, and had seen that the answer was
given correctly, altho in a little differ-
ent wording from the way that he had
put in the set of answers, he would have
made that necessary allowance and grad-
ed the paper as correct.

‘Take another study at random, say
Biology: ‘Vhe professor in that subject
dues not do as the professor in Buble,
writing out a set of answers that are tu
be used as a model in guiding the stu-
dent who corrects the papers. “The pro-
fessor leaves the correcting entirely to
the judgment of the student, which at
times is sadly deficient, for the simple
reason that the student does not know
what was brought out on class. ‘he
student grades the papers according to
the way that the subject was taught
when he was taking it, whereas it nught
now be taught in a different way, things
emphasized now that were not empha-
sized a year or two ago, and things that
were emphasized a year or two ago, not
being emhpasized now. ‘lhus, the sys-
tem of grading used by the student is
out of date, wrong, in other words.
That is of course not his fault, but the
fact remains that it goes pretty hard
with the ones who are having their pa-
pers corrected, especially, since they an-
awered the question exactly as it was
given by the professor in the class room.

Again, it is a psychological fact that
1 student who corrects the review pa-
yers is more or less inclined to partial-

ty. Allowances are made by him for
wther students who are his personal
‘riends, are upper classmen, or who are
ronor roll men. ‘This statement may be
‘enied by some few, particularly those
vho do the grading, but it is a fact, and
an not be disputed. Instances of this
act are shown every month by some of
he students who correct papers, altho

not shown by the same student every
month,

Some of the faults and limitations in
the system of student grading have been
shown. What are some of the good
points? There is only one good point,
or advantage that this system has, and
that is that it gives to some students the
chance to earn‘money to help defray ex-
penses. That is of course a very good,
noble and humane advantage, and may
counterbalance all the oppositions and
failures that may be brought against, or
are in, this system. Some may say that
it helps the professor, but does it? He
does not have to go over the papers the
first time, it is true, and is saved that
much trouble, but he is continually be-
ing bothered after every review given
by students who return their papers to
him to be re-corrected. The professor
would not have this trouble and incon-
venience each month, and the students
would not be dissatisfied by the grading,
of the grading was done in the first place
by the professor himself. 1 have made a
cycle, and come back to where | started,
and will close with the same question
asked at the first: Should the system of
student grading be abolished ?

INQUISITIVE.

AN ADVERTISEMENT.

There is a proposition which presents
itself as one of the most profitable ways
in which you can spend your summer va-
cation. It is not to explain the chromatic
aberration of the lens in -a stereoscope,
nor to demonstrate the usefulness, light-
ness and tensile strength of aluminum
for cooking purposes, nor to present the
paramount value of some book being
distributed, which requires a wonderful
knowledge of the intricate themes of the
subject matter. Nor is it to say that
this particular apple tree will grow best
in this particular soil.

But to those who have planned a
period of leisure and want to combine
genuine enjoyment and _— self-culture,
there is a scheme by which one may do
this. If you have planned to sit in the
drug store all summer, or loaf around
some peanut joint, or sit on a goods box
and whittle. change your plans at once.
Get a supply of the best literature and
read it, not thoughtlessly, but earnestly
and with a purpose. Get a copy of
Wordsworth’s poems and go down by
a small, quiet stream and. ‘neath the
shade of the huge, overspreading beech,
let the poet tell you of true enjovment
of nature and of the formative influences
of nature unadorned. Let him instill
into you the thought that

“One touch of the vernal wood
May teach vou more of man

Of moral, evil and of good
Than all the sages can.”

As the brook whispers softly, drink
deeply from the wells of literature
which have their sources in Lamb, Scott?
De Quincy, Shelby, Byron and Keats.
Be sure and get a copy or copies of some
good Southern literature—in which are
treasures that are little known. Tho
same have produced no real thought to
the world’s knowledge, yet there is much
material for thought. The beautiful
esxpressions will help you to be more
efficient in your own speech and writing.
Go out and see the farmer and his plow
