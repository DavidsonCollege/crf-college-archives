DWELLERS OF EAST
ARE ACCOMPLISHED
IN FANCY DANCING

Impromptu Orchestra Provides
Rhythmical Harmony for Re-
viewers of Square Dances

Looming high in current social
events was the Stag Square Dance
held in the parlor of East, last Satur-
day night. Pleasant lighting effects,
rythmic music, and smoke laden at-
mosphere featured the struggle. Due
to the fact that it was unannounced, a
better crowd was present than was
expected.

Only twice in a period of over two
hours the figures were stopped in or-
der to allow the muscicians and “call-
er’ an opportunity to catch breath.
Because of lack of floor space the
“Virginia Reel” was the only common-
ly known figure omitted. ~

During the first intermission it was
decided that, due, to the large number
of unexpected guests present, refresh-
ments would not be served as planned.
It was further agreed that each “gen-
tleman” should provide for his escort
at the termination of the last figure.

Chorus girls would have found them-
selves put to shame by many trippers
of the fantastic toe. That famous
Russian Toe Dancer would have blush-
ed in embarassment at many of the
number twelves scraping the floor.
Ziegfeld and Earl Carroll undoubted-
ly missed a good opportunity for fu- |
ture “Scandals.”

It unfortunate announce-
ment cannot be made the effect |
that a special exhibition will be given
at some future date. Offers have not
been received from the Carolina Thea- |
tre but are expected daily.

It would be hard to determine those |
who were outstanding on this social |
occasion. Mention is certainly «due!
to Sid McCarty, caller for the even-
ing. Little escaped him and he proved
to be both the life and inspiration of
the party, proving himself familiar |
with all figures.

Johnny Melton also exhibited great
form and showed knowledge of this
particu’ar method of recreation; he
was accompanied by Rut Nunan, Also
deserving of mention was Pat Boyle,
who captivated all by his gracefulness,
lightness of foot, and ‘his jigs be-
tween rounds. He was accompanied
by “Happy” Gladstone. Among those
who shined with their shins were:
Messrs: Ellett, Ramseur, Burch, Nor-
ton, Powell, Kramer and Hayes.

Special honor goes to. the orchestra,
composed of “Proc” Thompson, guitar,
and Bettis, three mouth organs. These
men, one an alumnus and the other a
student gave their all for Davidson.
Their breath was long and their lung
capacity prodigious., “A good time
was had by all.”

DAVIDSON’S RADIO
STATION WORKING

Some of Davidson's raido fans have
built a station in the old
pump house below the tennis courts.
The project was sponsored by the Phy-
sics department and its was through
the influence of Dr. J. M. Douglas
and Professor Fulcher that they pro-
cured the use of the house. Those en-
gaged in the work are: S. L. McCarty,
R. B. Hayes, D. J. Caldwell, F. H. Rol-
lins, H. S. Monroe, T. H. Hall, E. S.
Bettis, and S. M. Woodson.

At present they have a 25-watt, set,
but they hope to build soon a t1o00-
watt affair, The one they’ now have
is by no means of inferior quality,
however, for recently they communi-
cated with Australia with Sid Mce-
Carty has had it for some time and
from time to time he has communi-
cated with many foreign countries.
He has cards acknowledging messages
received from Czechoslovakia, Italy,
Hungary, Germany, France, Costa
Rica, Cuba-and Canada. Inf the United
States he has exchanged messages
with forty states, including Califoria
and Oregon. One of the Canadian
stations was on Prince Edward Island
and another in Vancouver, British
Columbia. Occasionally they have
had some truble talking with foreign-
ers who did not speak English, the
international wireless language, but
they managed fairly well by using in-
ternational “Q signals” which suffice
for ordinary wireless’ conversations.

Sid McCarty announces that they
will be glad to transmit messages for
any of the boys. It would hardly be
worth while to send any to a destina-
tion less than five hundred miles he
states. Last year at one time he
caught a message relayed by a New
Hampshire station which had originat-
ed in New Zealand, He mailed it on
to its destination in Durham where it
arrived than twenty-four hours
after it was started in New Zealand.

REV. McELWAY TALKS

(Continued from page 1)

“The second sin is thinking that the
ends of our noses is the horizon, That
is the folly of thinking that what you
want is what you ought to have. In
the scriptures we find the words ‘The
fool saith in his heart there is no
God’”.

“There are not only great examples
of righteousness in the scriptures but
also of folly. The 51st Psalm records
David's repentance as a fool for his
sins.”

“Samson paid the wages, not only
of sin but also of folly, The multi-
tude had the curse of Christ’s murder
on ther heads for sin, not alone, but
also for folly.”

“The very talented and rich young
ruler, who can be likened to one whom
we would select as our student body
president or campus leader, was an
outstanding example of a fool. He
turned away from Christ because he
was a sinner and a fool.”

“But the greatest of all fools,” said
Rev. McElway, “is a Judas. Judas,
who sold not only Christ, but himself
for thirty pieces of silver because he
was so great a fool, is living today.
He goes to many prayer meetings, is
a member of the church and prays
and talks too much.”

“Not only are there Judases today,
but Samsons, rich young rulers, multi-
tudes and’ Davids.”

“There are three crosses today,”
said the speaker in closing “they are;
the one in the middle with Christ on
it, the one on the left with fools on it
and the one on the right with those
who have discovered and learned the
wickedness of folly.”

Mumble--Fifty-fifty.
Mutter—What do you mean by fifty-
fifty ?
Mumble—His English is fine but his
Scotch is diluted.

From the Air
Heidelberg College—(CNA) — The
football which was used in the game
with Hiram at Heidelberg College last
week was dropped from an airplane,
to start the game.

Kenneth Ebel, former Heidelberg
student, entertained the crowd before
the game with stunt flying and then
dropped the ball to the field when it
was time for the game to start.

The wind was strong and .the ball
struck the fence when released and
bounced out of the field. It was re-
covered and the game started.

LG

BLUE DEVIL’S WIN

(Continued from page tT)
air thrusts, coupled with line drives

by Godfrey and Murray, took the ball
to Davidson’s one yard line and Mur-
ray skirted left end for the marker.
Buie converted with a perfect boot
through the uprights. The second
quarter might well be entitled “War
Birds.” Duke’s backfield and flank
men continued the air game with dis-
astrous results for their opponents.
Keeps It Up

Immediately after the period open-
ed, Duke ripped off three first downs
in a row in a drive from its own 46-
yard line to its third touchdown. Mur-
ray clipped off six yards, Jankoski, on
his first play after substitution added
16 yards on a pass from Buie, and
Buie heaved to Godfrey for five yards.
Duke mixed a devastating pot-pourri
of drives and passes, Jankoski finally
circling left end for five yards. The
remaining four and_ three-quarter
inches to a touchdown was negotiated
by Buie, who failed to kick goal.

Passes and more passes darkened
the skies for the remainder of the half
which went scoreless. Davidson per-
formed a miraculous feat in keeping
possession of the oval during the
greater part of the period, but the
virtuallyimpregnable Duke-line_liken-
ed the visitors to the individual who
is all dressed up with no place to go.
Davidson didn’t get far, but Harper
and Flinn thwarted separate Duke sal-
lies into their territory by intercepting
a Blue Devils pass each.

/ Forced to Punt

Unfguccessful ‘line plunges invariably

forced Davidson to punt out of im-
mediate danger, The most spectacular
pass of the-game, netted Duke 38

yards, sailed in the half’s closing mom-
ents from Buie to Peeler.

Duke’s remaining 13 points came in
the third quarter. Another alternat-
ing series of passes and line smashes
early in the period brought the Blue
Devils to Davidson's 30-yard line be-
fore they were momentarily halted,
the longest gain of this episode prov-
ing a 28-yard pass from Buie to War-
ren. .
Davidson afterward threw a
scare into their rivals when the re-
feree gave them the ball on their punt
at Duke’s 27-yard line when he pen-
alized the Blue Devils for an infrac-
tion of the rules. It looked like a
case of holding.

Oxford Revolt
Oxford, England—(CNA)—A thou-

| sand students, revolting against what

they claimed was unusually strict en-
forcement of university rules, stormed
the proctor’s building last week.
Windows were broken and _ tele-
phones disconnected. Fire engines
were summoned, but the municipal
police stood by without. interfering.
The Proctors at Oxford have wide, ad-
ministrative authority and are respon-
sible for discipline. College authori-
ties are searching for the ringleaders.

Goodbye Dartmouth
Hanover, N. H. (by New Student
Service)—A Dartmouth student has
done what almost everyone who has
read Walden yearns to do at one time
or another, Curtis H. Glover, twenty,

jand a junior, has bid goodbye to col-

lege and civilized life to begin anew
in the woods, far away from the pain-
ful pressures of organized society.
“Goodbye Dartmouth,” he wrote in
a letter published in The Dartmouth:
“By the time you read this I shall
be aboard a train speeding to northern
wilds where I intend to prepare myself
for a higher life than college leads to;
the life described by Thoreau in Wal-
den.
“T_have existed in your civilization
now for twenty years. I have existed
merely spectator. You have
forced me to do certain things, and I
have done them—reluctantly always
inwardly rebelling. Now I have de-
cided to give expression to my wild na-
ture, and to try whether it be possible
to live humanly.”

as oa

The new Walden is located in the
White Mountains on the estate of Mr.
Glover, senior, who is a wealthy Bos-
ton architect. The news reports do
not tell much about the economic side
of the experiment, which} to us, seems
the crucial one. For what Henry
Thoreau was principally, intent upon.
doing was to find out how one might
live the most complete and satisfying
life that was possible, with the mini-
mum expenditure of energy in filling
the belly and housing the body. If
that is one of the purposes of the ex-
periment it will be worth watching.
