DR. R. E. ROTH GIVES
LECTURE ON TRAVELS
OVER SOUTH AMERICA

Dr. T. W. Lingle Introduced the Lec-
turer With a Brief Survey of
His Attainments

ILLUSTRATED BY SLIDES

The Lecturer Told of Many Fascinat-
ing Episodes of Travel

‘Last Monday night Dr. Robert E. Roth
delivered a travelogue accompanied with
brilliant lantern slides entitled, “Wonder-
lands of South America.” Dr. Roth con-
ducted his audience over an imaginary route
through South America. The lecturer began
the “journey” from New York, by boat, and,
sailing down through the Panama Canal, he
arrived at Ecuador. The trail continued from
here up the Andes to Quito; from-here to
the capital of Ecuador; then into Peru to
the capital, Lima; on into Bolivia, to La
Paz; thence along the coast of Chile to Val-
paraiso; and on to famous Buenos Aires,
capital of Argentina; then, through the City
of Butantan, to Sao Paulo of Brazil; and
finally through the Brazilian jungles to the
South Atlantic Coast.

On this trip, the lecturer told of many
fascinating episodes of travel. He told of
the Weaving of Panama hats in Ecuador,
which get their name from the fact that
they were formerly shipped from Panama.
He &xplained about the Cacao industry,
houses built on stilts, and of transportation
and open air markets, Also Dr, Roth told
of the remains of Pizarro preserved ina
glass sarcophagus; of llamas, the pack-ani-
mals of South America, which will consist-
ently refuse to carry a load of more than
a hundred pounds; of Inca ruins of Cuzco in

’ Peru, the stones of which are so nicely fit-
ted together that it would be impossible to
fit a knife blade into them; of the nitrate
fields of Chile; of the Christ of the Andes
which was erected to commemorate a
boundary dispute; also Dr. Roth told of
Sugar’ Loaf Mountain, of the producer-to-
consumer-direct method of milk delivery,
and of the miles of palm-lined, mosaic-payed

ey a venties of Rio de Janeiro, and of many
other fascinating items of travel lore.

Dr. T. W. Lingle introduced the speaker
with a short summary of his attainments.

Dr. Lingle Returns
From Speaking Tour

Makes Numerous Talks on Missions in
Various Floridian Cities on
Speaking Tour

At chapel Thursday morning the students
were delighted to see back in his customary
place their president, Dr. Walter Lingle. For
over three weeks Dr. Lingle has been on a
speaking tour in Florida, having left here
on January 14th and returned February 9th.

The group of thirteen men and women,
called “The Florida Chain of Missionary As-
semblies,” of which he was a part, was com-
posed mostly of distinguished missionaries
from all over the world, representing prac-
tically all phases of mission work. This-body
was chosen for the purpose of‘ acquainting
the people of Florida with the problems
confronting the missionary world of today.

It was quite an honor bestowed upon
President Lingle to be chosen as one of this
group. His part of the work was the con-

Drive for 1937 Class

Information was received Monday
from the office of Mr. Hengeveld,
registrar, to the effect that some five
hundred cards concerning the prospect-
ive students of the class of 1937 have
been turned in by the students of Da-
vidson. These cards were distributed
among members of the student body
two weeks previously. Each prospect-
ive student will receive a letter from
the registrar containing a bulletin and
other information concerning David-
son. Mr. Hengeveld stated that the
number of men already enrolled in the
class of 1937 exceeds the number of
1936 students listed on the books at
this time last February.

Four Deputations Are
Sent Out by Y.M.C.A.

Y. M. C. A. deputations grew to an un-|
usually large number this week, and includ-
ed several Student Volunteer missions. The
first was sent to Charlotte, where Sam
Nicky and Ben Rose spoke at the Y. M.
C. A., Nicky talking to the younger boys
and Rose to the larger group. This work is
under the direction of the Boys’ Work De-
partment, which meets at 2:30 on Sunday
afternoon. During the last week in this
month and the first week in March, this
department will call on the Davidson “

Association.

Ed Humphrey led the services and intro-
duced Dr. Williams. Prayer was offered by
Charles Bettis and Hubert Morris. This was
followed with a voice solo by Grainger Wil-
liams, accompanied at the piano by Ed Me-
Nair.

The text of Dr. Williams’
taken from Numbers 13:30, “And Caleb
stilled the people before Moses and _ said,
‘Let us go up at once and possess it; for we
are well able to overcome it.” He briefly
explained. how the Children of Israel sent
out twelve leading men all, to look
over the land that God had promised them.
Ten of them were impressed principally with
the strength of the inhabitants, this, in their
eyes, overshadowed the wonderful riches of
the land. “And we were in our own sight
as grasshoppers, and so we were in their
sights,” they reported, But Caleb and Joshua,
the other two, were not dismayed. They,
also, had seen the gigantic size of the inhab-
itants. but they knew that the’ God who led
the Children out of the bondage of Pharoah,
mighty sovereign of his time, the God who
led them through the seemingly impassable
Red Sea, could, with ease, give them victory
over the giants of Canaan. And so they,
having faith in God, were ready to enter the
land, ‘

Nevertheless, the Children sided with the
ten, and, as a result, they had to wander
forty years in the wilderness. The other ten
men were condemned to die there, never
reaching Canaan. Thus God deals with those
who have not faith with Him.

The world is divided into men
and men who can’t, the cans and the can’ts.
Dr. Williams told of his entering college,
and, because prepared, being given a six
weeks’ trial period. He naturally was over-
ladened with work to make up his defici, |
ency. In geometry he had heard that if
every theorm is not learned: the student
absolutely could not pass. During the course
of his studies, due to the excess of work, it
became necessary for him to leave out half
of his book. Consequently it appeared that
he would fail, but he kept on trying. When
the exams were over, fearing to go himself
to the professor for his grade. Gnéat was

The third issue of the “Yow!” will appear
jon March Ist. This was announced recently

will be shorter than the former issues, but
will contain more cuts in the form of hu-

believes that this is a decided improvement.

The staff also announces that they have
obtained a permit from the postal authori-
ties to mail the “Yowl” as second class mat-
ter, thus those not living in dormitories will
receive their copies through the mail.

The fourth and final issue of the “Yowl”
