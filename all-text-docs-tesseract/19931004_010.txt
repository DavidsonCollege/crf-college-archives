THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1993

Oops, wrong person, I'm sorry; Who looks the same?

By Tene' Moore

Has anyone ever approached
and addressed you as someone
else? Do other students constantly
mistake you for another person?
Maybe you have similar features
of another person, like the same
smile, hair style, physique or what-
ever. If this has happened to you,
like me, the first time you might
laugh to yourself, say hello, and
continue on your way without giv-
ing the mistake a second though.
You may even be bold enough to
politely correct the person and in-
form them that you are not really
the person whom they have mis-
taken you for. Or maybe, like
many students, this has never hap-
pened to you.

I ask this question because, I,
like several Davidson African
American students, am constantly
addressed as other African Ameri-
can females. That’s when it oc-
curred to me that the rumor of
whites thinking that we all (Afri-
can Americans) look alike might

actually have some truth to it. I
didn’t attribute the incorrect name
calling as pure error because it
happened so much.

After my freshman year I be-
gan correcting people when they
called me the names of other black
female students. I could under-
stand it if someone saw me from
behind or a distance and inaccu-
rately called me another person,
but to blatantly see me face to face
and still think that I was someone

else became ratherirritating.Many, |

if not most of the time the mistaken
person and I, aside from being
black, looked nothing alike.
Some instances people actu-
ally carried conversations with me,
thinking that I was Shiela or Janet
(fiction names) and still did not
detect any discomfort. Sometimes
I went along with these conversa-
tions and the person never knew
that I wasn’t the other person, and
other times I’d say, “I’m not such
and such" then listen to them ex-
plain how identical such and such

‘light of the emphasis Davidson
: places on the availability of its
' facilities to its students, such as the

use of athletic facilities by non-
Varsity athletes.

While I appreciate the poten-
tial difficulties of making the Vi-
sual Arts Center open to general
student use due to regulation, bud-
geting, and safety problems, I be-
lieve it is possible to allow stu-
dents with a proven interest and
viable experience access to facili-
ties constructed with the aid of
their tuition, especially if that use
is in some Way controlled and the
School is reimbursed for the mate-
rials. Perhaps the institution of
such a system would allow the
students of Davidson to feel truly
that the new Visual Arts Center is
“theirs,” as its promoters claim.

Although it was discouraging
to learn from Professor Jackson
that the facilities of the Visual Arts
Center are not available to stu-
dents not currently enrolled in art
classes, the restrictions of the
department’s policies were not
nearly as daunting as the attitudes
expressed toward my interest in
ceramics. I was informed that
Davidson’s sculpture program was
never intended for the production
(as opposed to creation) of ves-

sels, that any use of the wheel in
Davidson’s sculpture classes
would be primarily to fashion a
component or base for a larger
pieces of sculpture, and the focus
of those classes would be “risk-
taking and exploration,” spiritual
experiences apparently not attain-
able through the art of pottery. Far
from encouraging my pursuit, both
professors leftme with the impres-
sion that my little hobby had no
place in the grand realm of real art.

It is not a private studio or a
one-woman show right in the
atrium next to the Rodin that I
request. My aim is simply this: to
be allowed access to facilities al-
ready in use in order to pursue
something that gives me great plea-
sure. Is this asking too much? I
didn’t think so, but it seems that
amid all the special events concur-
rent with the opening of the Visual
Arts Center, my invitation got lost
in the public relations fuss. I am
left wondering what exactly
Davidson is promising its students
and how much they will actually
deliver. Lastly, I am reminded of
the familiar descriptions of “acom-
munity of exceptional individuals
with diverse interests and back-
grounds,” carefully selected to
populate our lovely campus and
regret being unable to make my
own contribution.

Country heads down the tracks

Trains continued from page 9

Okay, you might not own a
truck. You might not want to own
one, and I realize that pick-ups
aren’t real practical for carpool,
etc., so I won’t tell you to buy one.

But you all can identify with the..

truck topic, I’m sure. Everyone
has, at sometime or another, hada
bottle or a garbage bag or some-
thing fly out ofatruck bed andland
on the hood of his car. .

And I know that every one of
you has had two very large, very

powerful, very scary eighteen-

wheelers form a wall on Highway ~

77 to keep you from getting by at
the speed you wouldlike to. We’ve

all seen and admired the earthy,

genuine, and horny folks that drive
these trucks, so even if you can’t
identify with the truck theme, you
know exactly what the songs are
talking about.

Prison. I’ll be the first to admit

thatsongs about prison pretty much
go flying right over my head. But if
the songs speak to you, I’m all for
it and am behind you one hundred
percent in your struggle for recov-
ery.

No matter what your back-
ground, country music has some-
thing to say to you, whether it be to
remind you to drive friendly, ridea
train, clean your room, or visit
your parole officer soon.

and I look. Last year I saw one
particular woman every other
morning.

For two entire weeks _ this
woman said, “Good morning
Theresa (another fiction name.”)
It was pretty early in the morning,
so I was usually still tired. But one
day I was awake enough to re-
spond, “I’m not Theresa, but my

name is Tene’. I appreciate your
friendly greeting each morning.”
My response may ’ve slightly elimi-
nated some of her embarrassment,
buther white face turned aburning
red, .

I hope and believe that the
majority of these cases are inno-
cent goof ups, but since I am not
white I do not positively know.

My point is not to condemn stu-
dents for making unintentional of-
fensive blunders, but to encourage
white students to think twice the
next time they approach an Inter-
national or African American stu-
dent.

And just think, y'all (white
students) may all look the same to
us too. Hum.

Lack of action upholds discrimination tacitly

Phobia continued from page 8

those enjoyed by heterosexuals,
but merely those equal to them!
“They choose to act like that,
so why should we protect them
when they can just change?” An-
other obstacle to equality is the

_perception that governmentshould

not endorse a deviant lifestyle that
individuals choose:

This claim assumes that there
isacertain lifestyle that goes along
with being gay, that itis voluntary,
and that it is intrinsically harmful
to society. In fact, we cannot pin
down a “gay lifestyle” or substan-
tiate the claim that it is harmful,
nor can we logically conclude that
gays choose to be hated and dis-
criminated against. Gaysare found
in every socioeconomic class, in
all professions from the clergy to
the Congress, in both political par-
ties, and in every extended family.

They are conservatives, virgins,
housewives, suicidal teenagers,
criminals, volunteer workers.
Being gay does not necessar-
ily bring about other qualities of
character, positive or negative.
Moreover, as we heterosexualscan

easily see, individual sexuality isa
profound, unchangeable, and in-~

nate aspect of the self. Thus, it is

an unjust basis for discrimination. .

Of course, civil rights protection
allows for the possibility that some-
one may be homosexual and in-

competent on the job, deserving to’

the terminated. However, a com-
petent homosexual could not be
fired because his or her boss hap-
pened to hate gays.

The specific policy lam advo-
cating, namely a Civil Rights Act

to protect sexual orientation, will

not change attitudes towards ho-
mosexuality overnight. However,
the U.S. government must quit tac-

itly upholding bigotry by its lack
of action. If gays know they can-

_ not be discriminated against, they

will be more willing to acknowl-
edge their true identity.

: Their “coming out” alone re-
duces homophobia dramatically,
as was shown in the U.S. News

“poll: Knowing someone gay was

the second-most important influ-
ence on one’s gay rights stance,
and of those, 66% supported gay
rights. How ridiculous the
homophobic stereotypes seem
when one realizes that a “fag” or a
“dyke” is a loved one! This Act
will gradually erode the practice of
discriminating against homosexu-
als, allowing us to finally utter
truthfully “. . . and liberty and
justice for all”.

Davidson's glass should be half-full

By Susan Beale

The other afternoon I was sit-
ting outside procrastinating on my
paper that was due tomorrow, be-
laboring over my reading andcom-
plaining to my roommates that I
was having a bad day. Not only did
I curse Davidson, but nature as
well: for the bright sun was bother-
ing my eyes, and the gusts of winds
were blowing my papers around. I
didn’t bother to notice the bright
blue sky, the pleasant temperature,
or the squirrel romping precari-
ously from branch to branch.

After a few minutes of self-
pity, I realized how spoiled and
ungrateful I was sounding. There
I was, a student supported by my
parents at one of the best liberal
arts colleges in the country, learn-
ing from some of the best profes-
sors in the country, surrounded by
many interesting and highly-tal-
ented students on a wonderful and
charming campus...and all I could
contribute was a complaint.

Yes, the workload is demand-
ing, the social scene is at times
limited, the school lacks some di-
versity, and yes, there are some
racial tensions; but when I peruse
through the Davidsonian, or walk
along campus, these topics seem to
be the only ones of interest.

These complaints are very dif-
ferent than the personal ones I ex-
perienced today, but my point is
that most of us seem to complain
too much.

What I am trying to relay is
coming directly from my heart.
I’msure you have heard the phrase,
that a glass is either half-full of
half-empty, depending on the way
you interpret it. Today I was see-
ing a half-empty glass, and it took
a lot of strength and discipline to
pull myself out of this mood. For

some reason, people find it enjoy-
able to ‘commiserate, complain,
criticize others, or feel sorry for
themselves as opposed to chang-
ing their situation.

Although the college needs
healthy criticism (or we would
make no progress and would al-
ways be a reactionary campus),
sometimes we need to put our situ-
‘ation in perspective. I have no-
ticed thatthe campus morale seems
depressingly low this year. What
happened to the “I love Davidson”
attitude that I heard as a freshman?

Before we complain about
how bad life is at Davidson, con-
sider how many wonderful things
we shouldbe thankful for. I would
venture to say that we all have
enough to eat, clothes to wear, and
a comfortable bed to sleep in.
(These simple aspects of life which

we consider as basic necessities
are, in actuality, luxuries for many
underprivileged people).

Have you ever visited the shel-
ter for homeless men in Charlotte?
These men really do not have any
place to go or any money to buy
food to nourish themselves. Be-
fore we envy someone else’s posi-
tion or status, we should rethink
how many people would be over-
joyed to be where we are situated
in life.

After having my revelation
this afternoon, I tried to see the
glass as half-full again. I looked
around, saw a beautiful campus, a
beautiful blue sky, enjoyeda gentle,
fresh breeze, breathed deeply, and
became thankful that I am who I
am and am where I am.

It is your decision: how do
you want to view the glass today
— half-full, or half-empty?

Anyone can be a racist

Stock continued from page 7

or common stock that a company
issues. I can think of no other

reason why they would say that .

"Racism implies economic and
political power..."

I admit that the word "stock"
can be confusing. To make sure
that stock does notimply economic
and political power, I looked up
the word in my thesaurus. Just to
make it clear, a thesaurus, accord-
ing to the dictionary, is "1. a book
of selected words or concepts as a
specialized vocabulary of a par-
ticular field, as medicine or music.
2. A book ofsynonyms." Iused the
type of thesaurus described in the
second part of the dictionary's defi-
nition.

According to my thesaurus

(Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus),
astockis "1. syn FAMILY 1, clan,
folk, house, kin, kindred, lineage,
race, tribe." According to my the-
saurus, a stock has nothing to do
with economic power.

By inserting the thesaurus'
synonyms into the dictionary's defi-
nition and taking out the word
"stock," racism must be the notion
that one's own ethnic lineage (race,
tribe, family, kin) is superior.

Soaccording tothe dictionary
and my thesaurus, minorities can
be racist. In fact, anyone with
ethnic lineage can be racist.

"Hey," I say tomy sixth grade
teacher. "I looked it up!"

"Waitasecond,"Isay to Rafael
and Travis. "Did you?"

Sincerely,

Jamie McConnel '96
