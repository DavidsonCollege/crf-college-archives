Low income families, the
disabled, nd persons 62 years
or older will soon be able to
secure for themselves comfor-
table and safe housing, spokes-
men for the town of Davidson
and the John Crosland Com-
pany said this*week.

Government subsidized ap-
artments are now under con-
struction on the shores of Lake
Norman near General Time,
Inc., northwest of downtown
Davidson. The six buildings of
the complex should all be
operational by February, 1979,
and. Davidson Town Clerk Bill
Brannon said that, ‘‘at least one
should be ready by December.”

Crosland Co. of Charlotte has *
been contracted to construct,
‘own, and operate the apart-
ments by the Federal Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban
Development, according to
‘company spokeswoman Beth
Moore.

Under the agreement, Cros-
land bears all construction and
operational costs, while HUD
has. set eligibility requirements
for tenants, insured Crosland’s
investment, and will pay a
majority of these tenants’ rents.

The facility will have six
buildings containing 14 one-
bedroom, 24 two-bedroom, 12
three-bedroom apartments.
Moore said: that, “The dwel-
lings will be energy-efficient
with good insulation, air condit-
ioning, central heating, and
completely modern pre-installed
kitchen facilities. Common
laundry facilities will be: provi-
ded, and a playground is under

consideration.”’ Although the
apartments could optimally ac-
comodate 196 people, a slightly

-smaller number of tenants are

actually expected.

Rent payments will be shared
between tenants and HUD.
Tenants are to pay according to
their ability as determined by
HUD. Such payments will not
exceed 25 percent of their
income. HUD will make up the
difference. %

. With full occupancy, rent has
been set at $201 per month for a

one-bedroom apartment, $240

for a two-bedroom, and $275 for

a three-bedroom dwelling.

The tenants themselves
would, of course, be paying only
a small portion of these fees.

bills will individual-ten-

' 38-year-old Allan P. Bakke

was illegally denied admission
to the University of California-
Davis medical school because he
is white.

The court also ruled that the
school’s admissions policy,
which reserved: 16 seats in a
class of 100 for minority stu-
dents, was unconstitutional.
Yet it was the court’s third
ruling—that colleges may con-

For admissions “éfficers are |

As a result, the academic
community is busily
“to various conferences ' ‘to see
it can concoct an accontable
affirmative action program on
its own. Professional organiza-
tions like the American Council
of Education and the National
Assessment of Educational
Progress, as well as schools

running < -off

from the University of Mary- -

land. to Mount Marty College in
South Dakota, have already
scheduled Bakke conferences
this fall. Other groups, like the
American Association for High
Education, have rushed opinion
booklets into print that cata-
logue admissions policy adjust-
ments in the Bakke decision’s
wake.” i

The adjustments to date
seem to be an empty consensus.
Among the consensus’ main
points:

—That any Yates pro-
gram that uses racial considera-

_tions in any way will '

be viewed by the courts as
“inherently suspect,” ‘and thus
be subject to’review!

give blacks both faculty and
staff positions ‘‘as soon as I can
find interested qualified candi-
dates for appropriate vacan-
cies.”’

Today, he is still looking,
according to the administra-
tors, but has largely failed.

Davidson has no black pro-
fessors today, and very few
black staff members.

But, according to Burnett,
this is. not Spencer’s fault:
“Every time we have an
opening he always encourages
us to consider minority candi-
dates,” Burnett said.

The College has also had a
difficult time attracting black

students, prompting one pre- —

sent black student to criticize
the admission’s program as
“ineffective: "’

‘Spencer also set up a Com-
mission on rm ei Ath-

letics, which resulted in a
restructuring of the football
program.

White said the football
change is ‘‘one of the most
positive things that’s happened
here. We were trying to be
something we could not be.”’

In other areas, Davidson's

. endowment has ‘‘fared very well

under Dr. Spencer,”’ rising from
13.7 to 21 million, according to
College Business piers Xo Ro-
bert Currie.

In his first annual report,
Spencer wrote, ‘the fact that
Davidson and Queens have both
run deficits in the past two
years and face the prospect of

further deficits in the future
meant that thése colleges can-
‘not be said to occupy favorable
positions, financially.’’

Currie said that the College
has never run in the red during
Spencer’s ten year, and said he
suspected this must be a source
of pride for Spencer. . ~

At the same time, ‘‘I feel like
he’s done an outstanding job of
continuing to give compensa-
tion increases annually, not
only to faculty but to all
non-faculty,” said Currie.

Meetze said the E. H. Little
Library, which was only dedi-
cated four years ago, is ‘‘really a

great credit” to Dr. Spencer.
