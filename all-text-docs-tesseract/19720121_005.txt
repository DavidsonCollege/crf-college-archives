LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To The Editor:

Having attended Davidson for
a4 year and a half, I have fallen
into the habit of ignoring all
but a few of the announce-
ments, advertisements, and no-
tices which seem to constanty
be crossing my door, bulletin
board, and dorm announcement
box. So last week when I re-
ceived an ‘‘edict from on high”
from the Director of Student
Housing I threw it away as 1
have many others. But later on.
after its contents had been re-
vealed to me by another stu-
dent, I re-read it.

This edict written by Mrs.
Scotty Nicholls dealt with what
Mrs. Nicholls has labeled as
the “increasing problem of the
cat and dog population in the

residence halls.” It seems that .

Mrs. Nicholls believes that the
cats and dogs owned by David-
sco students are somehow insti-
gating a plot to “harass the

CECIL BURNEY

custodians . . . relieve them-
selves on walls and vending
machines . . and excrete in
corridors and on stairs... .”

Mrs. Nicholls also says that
she refuses to be intimidated by
these animals and will begin to
“clean up the town” so to speak
by evicting and impounding
these squatters.

I couldn’t help but be amused
with this notice and appalled at
the ridiculousness of the whole
idea. It seems inconceivable to
me that Mrs. Nicholls could be
that threatened by the less than
half dozen dogs, cats, and ‘‘ex-
otic pets’’ owned by Davidson
students.

Perhaps she just wants to
protect our custodians from
harassment by such animals as
President Spencer’s dog. If so
then her intenticns are admira-
ble, but let’s just hope she does
a better job protecting our cus-
todians than the security cus-

emands Rights

todians do in protecting our Co-
eds. Or maybe she wants to
keep us all from moral decay
by eliminating the chance of
huggery becoming rampant on
the Davidson campus.

Whatever her reasons, her
“clean-up job” could achieve
the best results by eliminating
the. dogs which are not owned
by Davidson students and which
originate in the town of David-
son, not the dorms, !f she di-
rected her attentions there she
would encounter most of the
difficulty, and also a great num-
ber of dogs owned by faculty
members such as Dave Fagg
and Dr. Spencer.

Another amusing aspect of
this edict is just how Mrs. Nich-
olls intends to enforce her new
policy of “law and order’. Per-
haps she plans something simi-
lar to a massive raid led by our
harassed custodians, janitors.

Some Say The Real Issues
Of Davidson Never Change

I was reading through some
old, old DAVIDSONIANs _ the
other day. This class of seniors
will be the only one left to re-
member the actual event which
I saw recorded in the issue of
Friday, September 27, 1968.

The occasion was President
Spencer’s first formal address
to the incoming freshman of the
Class of 72. The thing is, Spen-
cer was a freshman of sorts
then too. That was his first year
in office as president here.

We dare not go back as far
as when he was a minor func-
tionary in the administration in
the early ‘50s. Or when he was
a ROTC Instructor before that.

Here’s something for your in-
formation. I just repeat the ac-
count as they heard it and saw
it then. The story tells itself.

“We cannot be a_ provincial
college. We must try to broaden
our outlook through our person.
nel, both student and faculty.
And I am interested in trying
to define the responsibility the
college has to help in the boot-
strap operation for the disad-
vantaged.”

On finding men and money
for the Honors College and non-
Western studies, Spencer said,
“It isn’t easy to find people for
this. ‘Non-Western people are
particularly difficult to find,
particularly competent people.
There’s a shortage of them, and
they’re in great demand.” |

Of the dorms, then in bad re-
pair, ‘“‘We need some sort of
renovation—certainly equipment
and possibly modification of de-
sign—within the limits of the
buildings we have now. And that
may rejuire more dorm space
to make up for any renovation.
This is an obvious need.”

Always money-minded, Spen-
cer said, “Compare the finan-
cial situation of the college to-
day (in: 1968) and of a genera-

tion ago. Actually, it's a lot bet-
ter college today (in 1968) than
it was then, and the case might
be made that it was in more
danger then. While we have to
watch the dollar, I think David-
son still has a very important
function to serve.”

On the rumor that he had op-
posed the Blue Sky Report of
yesteryear while he was still a
mere trustee, Spencer said,
“Not true. | think it was long
overdue. Any criticism that |
had was really that it did not
go far enough.”

As for the cuollege’s church
commitment, Spencer said, ‘‘It
doesn't stifle Davidson. The
Christian commitment of the
college emphasizes such things
as concern for persons, a search
for truth, and openness to the
rights and dignity of other in-
dividuals. I just don’t see how
these things run counter to the
values which I believe the vast
majority of people at Davidson
believe in.”

On student involvement: “We
have to remember that people
in a college administration or
faculty have a continuing re-
sponsibility, while no student
has a four year responsibility.
It is very difficult to delegate
properly absolute authority and
control to students who have
cnly temporary responsibilities.
But I certainly think students
ought to have participation and
voice in many areas of college
policy.”

Self scheduled exams were
not then reality. Spencer had
this to say on their behalf. “We
had them at Mary Baldwin and
on the basis of our experience
there, | would certainly recom-
mend them. Both students and
faculty seem to like if and we
had no trouble with it. Every-
body testified to the fact that
it seemed to lessen exam pan-

oe

ic.

Neither had the Board of
Trustees been reorganized, or
we might say the deck shuffled
and the wildcards thrown out.
Spencer had this to say then:
“There certainly might be a
more effective way to choose
Trustees. The board might be a
more effective board if it were
reconstituted. For example, the
variety in the way trustees are
chosen, and in the terms they
serve often makes an efficient.
smooth running operation diffi-
cult.”

Some say time moves slow.
Some say the real issues never
change. Some say the mills of
the gods grind slow, but they
grind exceeding fine.

Mecklenburg County Vice Squad.

It could be formulated by the
tactical geniuses in our R.O.T.C.
department and commanded by
our Sargeant Penley. Or maybe
she has in mind a bounty sys-
tem complete with ‘‘dead or
alive” wanted posters and in-
creasing rewards. Along a more
productive line, she may start a
work study job in dog catching
with students themselves acting
as enforcers.

Why if it becomes popular
enough the Educational Policy
Committee may raise dog catch-
ing to academic credit level and
use it to replace Dr. Reid’s ge-
ography course which is belng
terminated at the end of this
term.

Whatever her methods, it is
clear that one way or another
Mrs. Nicholls intends to stand
as a bulwark against the raging
tide of canine infiltration.

Regardless of her reasons,
Mrs.,.Nicholls’ time could be
better spent in pursuing actual
problems rather than in pursu-
ing dogs. There are greater
problems in our dorms than
dogs’ fleas, and they generally
come in the sizes of cockroach-
es and rats.

Our Security Guards could al-
so put their time to better use
by protecting our stndents than
in chasing dogs. Besides, the
poor guards are so old the
chances of them catching any
dog are very slim. Here again
is a prime examle of where
Davidson’s administrative pri-
orities lie.

In closing, I hope that Mrs.
Nicholls will take to heart what
I have said and rescind her
edict. If not then I advise the
goldfish owners of Davidson to
unite and take a stand against

administrative repression be-
fore they too end-up like the
dogs and the S.P.E.’s .. . off
campus.

The Campaign Invades Our Dreams

To the Editor:

Beirig in a unique position of
an upperclassman and also liv-
ing in a freshman domitory, I
believe I am in an excellent po-
position to write a rebuttal to
Mr. Fleming. It appears that,
though clouded somewhat by
references to foreign students
and coeducation, the main brunt
of Mr. Fleming’s letter is di-
rected toward the failure of the
new social system to reach the
freshmen.

Mr. Fleming states, ‘I shud-
der to think what my freshman
year would have been like if it
had not been for the upperclass-
men I knew.’ However, Mr.
Fleming as an upperclassman
seems not to have met or helped
freshmen.

Is it that this freshman class
has no need of upperctass ac-
quaintances? One knows better.
Is it that there are fewer fresh-
men? Of course not. Is if that
there is less upperciass-fresh-
men contact. With mixed class-
es, combined IMAC, and fresh-
men eating on the court, !
doubt it.

If Mr. Fleming hasn’t met
any freshmen it’s because he
doesn’t want to, not because of
the new social system. If such
attitudes prevail at Davidson,
then the quality and quantity
of students will dwindle.

I, for one, do not believe this
will occur. In fact I believe the
new system will be a success
by the end of this year.

Hopefully those upperclassmen
who befriended Mr. Fleming did
so out of a desire for friendship
and not as a result of voting
among thelr peers.

In closing I would say that
many freshmen would appreci-
ate it if Vic would help them
with their social life and be-
friend them. I believe also that
Mr. Fleming need not worry
about freshman halls voting on
whether to accept his friend-
ship.
