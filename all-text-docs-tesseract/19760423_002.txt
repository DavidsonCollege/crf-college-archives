Enright takes bicentennial
forensic tourney in Atlanta

By SAMUEL CRAWFORD
Staff Writer

Davidson College Junior
Robert A. Enright captured
first place at the Southeast
Regional Bicentennial Youth
Debates held in Atlanta, April
9-17.

Included in the Southeast
region were representatives
from the two Carolinas,
Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Tennessee.
First prize consisted of a $1000
savings bond, a set of medals,

and a trip to the Nationals, to |

be held in Washington in
June.

Enright formed part of a .

Davidson team which included
Susan Baynard in Persuasive
speaking and Mark Gergen in
Extemporaneous speaking.
Davidson competitors elimi-
nated before regionals were
Gordon Widenhouse and Tony
Snow. :

Evaluating the competition,
Enright commented, ‘‘Tony
was the toughest until

Atlanta. There the competi-
tion was quite tough. The
second place finisher was a girl
by the name of Mary Ackles, a
senior from Springfield Col-
lege at Alabama.

‘We both finished 6-1 but I
beat her on speaker points,
145 to 138. I did beat her in
the first round we had. It was
around robin tournament,’’
said Enright.

Enright will move onto
national competition to be
held in Washington D.C. from
June 6 to June 10.

“First of all I ought to
clarify the fact that there may
not even be a debate at
nationals, that’s what they

told me. Now either they’ve
run out of prize money or they
don’t’ want to hold a final
elimination,’’ he said.

“They didn’t think there
would be anything competi-
tive but they didn’t really
know. They were supposed to
send me a letter this week with
a schedule. It all seems rather
shadowy.”

Enright notes that the Bi-

PURE PRAIRIE LEAGUE perfor-

centennial Debate Resolutions
were all historical topics and
were considerably superior to
“your average run-of-the-mill
debate proposition.”

The topics included quest-
ions concerning the nature of
consumer affairs in a govern-
ment regulated economy, the
adequacy of political parities
and the moral consistency of
American foreign policy.

C:U:N-Y cutbacks

Faced with severely restricting budget reductions, the
governing board of the City University of New York
recently restructured the University system, including an
end to the open admissions policy and the mergerer of four
colleges into two.

The open admissions policy, part of the system since
1970, guaranteed every local high school graduate a place
somewhere in the university. The move restricted senior
college admission to students in the top third of their high
school class and community college admission to the top
three-fourths of their high school classes.

The universitiy reveives almost half of its funding from
the City of New York, which has experienced certain fiscal
problems recently. The system’s current budget is seven
percent less this year than last year and the City has
threatened to cut off all support within two years.

‘Commie watch’

The Pentagon’s Director of Defense Research and
Engineering, Malcolm Currie, has approved a proposal for
‘monitoring and controlling’ students from communist
countries studying “at the more significant laboratories of
U.S. technical institutes and universities.”

Currie approved a proposal from the ‘“‘Task Force on
Exports of U.S. Technology,’’ whose members were
governmental officials and senior industial executives.
The task force was formed in 1974 following charges that
the Soviet Union was taking advantage of detente by
using technological and industrial products to obtain
products and technique of strategic value.

The proposal is part of an over-all strategy to prevent
communist countries from obtaining American strtegic

technology.

With Black Week and
Frolics both behind, members
of the Union Board and Black
Student Coalition could sit
back and appraise the efforts

the results.

According to Union Presi-
dent Karl Goodhouse, both
the events presented at Spring
Frolics and the student turn-
out were good.

Goodhouse said that he like
the idea of starting the week-

could wind up by Saturday
night and leave people free
on Sunday to catch up on their
work and recuperate from the
weekend.

Commenting on the issue of
planning Frolics on Easter
weekend, Goodhouse said he
thought that the planning
committees did a good job in
setting activities that
wouldn’t interfere with the
religious activities on campus
or disrupt any activities in

Onin Director C. Shaw
Smith said that the only
problem was the fact that a
lot of people went home for
Easter and this hurt the
turnout.

Otherwise, Smith was glad
to see the issue raised of the
attitude toward Easter of a
church-affiliated school.

Smith said he backed the
faculty’s statement of Easter
as a special time, but was
unhappy that one reason that
the decision was made to
schedule Spring Folics on
Easter was becuase professors
wanted to protect their stu-
dents who were taking com-
prehensives.

“If professors are going to
make their students study
through Easter, I see no
reason why they shouldn’t let
their students blow off some
steam, too,” said Smith.

“T was able to attend seve-
ral services this weekend, and
I was thankful for all of them.
Especially the Sunrise service
Easter morning,” said Smith.

Black Student Coalition
President Derry Harper said
he was satisfied with Black
Week in some respects, and
disappointed in others.

Harper said he was very

disappointed in the student
response to Black Week. ‘‘The
purpose of Black Week was
not to have a series of activi-
ties just for blacks. We
wanted to present aspects of
the black culture which, in our
opinion, reflect some of the
richness of the black culture.

““We wanted the students of
Davison to share in it and
learn from it. That did not
happen,” he said.

Some disappointment was
expressed concerning the per-
formance of the D.C. Rep-

Harper

ertory Company. The group
danced well but had some
problems with the floor in
Love Auditorium. The Com-
pany destroyed a number of
their costumes on the rough
surface and one dancer hurt
her foot so badly she had to be
caken to the infirmary.

Harper said that he was

: very pleased with the planning

and execution of the week. He
felt that the activities were of
very good quality, and came
off as well as could be expec-
ted.
