Blues with
no feeling

Tinsley Ellis concert
epitomizes blues flamboyance

By DAVE WILLIARD
Staff writer

This semester has broughttwo
technically superior blues players
to the Davidson campus. A couple
months ago Jimmy Thackery
passed through, and last Monday
night Tinsley Ellis played a Live
Monday set in the 900 Room that
was perhaps a quintessential ex-
ample of blues flamboyance.

The weekend before
Monday’s Union gig, Ellis’s band
played some dates in Idaho as ac-
tor Bruce Willis’ backup band.
Their stint with Willis was a part of
an extended tour in support of the
band’s new album Storm Warn-
ing, their sixth release with Alliga-
tor Records. In the last year the
band has played extensively in the
United States, Europe, and
throughout Australia.

Ellis, who almost studied: at
Davidson a few years back, has
been touring for several years.
“Being able to support myself do-
ing this is a goal in and unto itself.
It was either this or law school!”
he said.

“The blues has never been this
popular. It has filtered down from
some of the famous stars who are
doing blues, like Clapton and
Bonnie Raitt,” Ellis explains.
While Chuck Berry and Willie
Dixon are two of his main lyrical

‘influences, his musical style draws

heavily from Clapton’s British
blues and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Although CD Review has
called Ellis the “heir apparent to
the blues-rock throne,” his sound
is one that we have heard many
times before. He may be techni-
cally proficient on guitar, but he
seems to me to lack some of the
blues’ raw emotion and honesty.
During his Monday night per-
formance, I felt like Ellis was quite
out of touch with the (albeit small)
audience, and his detached physi-
cal stance seemed to confirm my
reaction. He can do most anything
with the guitar, but I didn’t feel
like he was really connected with

his material. Several songs had -
abrupt mood swings that elicited .

uncomfortable reactions from the
crowd,

Certainly, flamboyance is im-
pressive, but the flow of the song
should come first. Unfortunately,
Ellis tends to push his material
farther than it should go.

If you are into guitar-virtuous
blues rock, then Ellis is a good
artist to check out. But if you want
to hear blues for its honesty and
sheer musical power, then I sug-
gest you give a listen to John Lee
Hooker. Hooker can do more with

one chord than Tinsley can do with
six albums and 12 whammy bars.

Tinsley is good, but his bag of
soloing tricks does not the real
blues make.

Dolores Claiborne puts a new

twist on the power of womanhood

By JoHN COPENHAVER
Arts & Living Editor

When I think Stephen King
movie, I think of undead kinder-
gartners and telepathic teenagers.
It was this assumption that was
absolutely dashed last week when
I saw Dolores Claiborne. This
movie, based on King’s book by

the same name, was one of the

most engrossing and emotionally
moving movies I’ ve seen in quite a
while.

Atthe beginning of the movie
we find Dolores Claiborne, played
by Kathy Bates, accused of the
murder of her long-time employer,
Vera Donovan. Vera’s death brings
Dolores’ daughter, performed by
Jennifer Jason Leigh, back to the
little New England town of her
childhood. As the story unfolds,
Vera’s murder brings up a mystery
from the past — the murder of
Dolores’ abusive husband.

Although the plot reveals it-
self in an unexpectingly original
manner, its the grace and power of
the acting that make it worth see-
ing. Both Bates and Leigh bring so
much vitality up to the of dark,
bleak surface of their character’s
lives that they sparkle with realism

its highs and lows, and how good
both can be in a world of color.
Colorisms dealt with these is-
sues sometimes humorously and
sometimes seriously, but always
in an engaging and entertaining
way. Ina scene about the person-
alities that make up a box of cray-
ons, each color had a different way
of looking at the world based on its
color. The pink and yellow cray-
ons were cheery, the red crayon
was somewhat fiery, the black
crayon seemed pretty depressed,
and the white ‘crayon was lonely

because it never got picked.

Inamore serious skit, a young
man paced at his father’s grave,
blaming his father for teaching him
to hate based on skin color. This
entire skit had a dark feel to it and
brought to light the literal issues of
color that are a part of our world.
Most of the other skits were very
humorous and ended on an “up”
note, furthering the theme that al-
though there are lows in an imper-
fect world, those lows are balanced
by highs.

The play ended on ahigh note,
as the traveler revisited the perfect
universe and received praise from
its leaders for his colorful world.
The leaders of the perfect universe
decided that a world full of color

was more fun, and all of a sudden
“All I Wanna Do Is Have Some
Fun” started playing. Everyone
started dancing and inviting audi-
ence members to join in, although
not many of them danced.
Although Colorisms may
have gone a little far on the cheese
factor with the song, the play was
highly entertaining and kept me
entertained — I was either laugh-
ing hysterically or on the verge of
tears the entire time. It often seems
that the purpose of theater is not to
entertain but to perplex. This play
did not do that, and I do not think a
play has to in order to be good.

This play made me think and made.

me laugh without being overly pre-
tentious, and I admire it for that.

on the screen. Bates makes
Dolores’ beauty and strength shine
through the years of guilt and quiet
anger she has stowed up inside
herself. Her relationship to her
daughter and her employer truly
examines the nature of love. In the
vicious society of small town New
England these women find the love
between one other to be the stron-
gest defense against a perverse
world of hatred and loneliness.
Taylor Hackford’s direction
makes interesting use of the cam-

that reflects the moods and person-
alities of the main characters. He
also uses clever scene changes
when portraying Dolores’ flash-
backs. He plays with the time and
place in these transitions by hav-
ing the present and the past overlap
as Dolores’ mind drifts back 18
years. In the climatic scene, the
death of Dolores’ abusive husband,
Hackford represents the black
beauty of a solar eclipse without
overdoing the special effect.
