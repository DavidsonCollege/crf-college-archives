PROF. E. J. ERWIN RETURNS
TO HIS ALMA MATER

Former Davidson Student Now
Holds Important Place
On Faculty.

The great strides forward David-

son has made in the last few years
has increased the number of men
desiring the study of English and
has necessitated the addition of an
assistant to Dr. Shewmake in the
English Department.
Davidson has been fortunate in
securing Prof. EE. J. Erwin, an old
Davidson man to fill this important
position.

Prof. Erwin graduated as Vale-
dictoriin of the class of ‘06, and re-
ceived his M.A, in 1907,

During his five years on the Hill
he was active in literary — circles,
having written for “The Davidson
Magazine” and “Quips and
Cranks.” He was also prominent
in literary society work, being pres-
ident of the Philanthropic Society
at one time, from which society he
recetved a diploma for completing
with honors the work prescribed.
He also figured in fraternity life be-
ing a member of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon Fraternity and becoming a
Mason after his college course.

After leaving Davidson he spent
‘three years teaching at the McCallie
School, at Chattanooga,
three years at De Witt Clinton
High School, New York City, and

* six years in the department of Eng-

lish at The University of Mississippi.
Having studied at Columbia Uni-
versity during the session of 1910-
1912, and at Chicago during the past

' summer session: he is now taking

up his work here. Prof. Erwin has
charge of part of the classes in
English [and UU, and is giving
Iinglish V. which class has been
formed to take the place of lublic
Speaking, and to give advise in
camposition writing.

Prof. Erwin is a native of North
Carolina, having been born at Mor-
ganton. N.C. and it is with a great
deal of pleasure that the student
body welcomes the return to David-
sen in the capacity of an instructor
of this Davidson man who knows
something of the ideals and princi-
ples of the old college, learned as a
student in its halls.

Real Work Begins in Lit-

erary Societies

Compulsory Voting is the Subject of
the Year’s First Debates

Phi Society

The Phi Socicty was called to
arder on time by the president.
After the roll call by the secretary
devotional exercises were conducted
by D. W. Roberts, In the tirst reg-
ular debate of the vear which fol-
flawed, on the subject “Resolved. that
the U.S. should adopt a compulsory
voting system.” many and varied
points were developed both by the
affirmative upheld by W. WK. Me-
Cain, A. F. Fricker, aid F.W. Smith,
in the order named. and the negative
by G.N. Neel, J. VF. Clark and TA.
Freeman. Dut in the eves of the
judges the negative side furnished
the better proof hence won the de-
cision,

Following closely on the heels of

the debate was a splendid oration |

on the subject “Music.” by Do R.
Freeman. Debating: ex-tempore on
the subject. “Resolved that the hour
of chapel should be moved.” C. W.
Robinson on the affirmative — side,
was unable to supersede J. C. Wool
iv the ald line, consequently lost the
decision of the committee.

Due to the short time allowed for
the mecting by the movies the many
interesting things prepared by. the
critics were necessarily omitted.
The program as announced by the
critic for next meeting includes only
members of the senior class to that
for a truly good program Saturday
night just drop in at the Phi Soci-
ety.

Under the head of business, sev-
eral new wien were enrolled as mem-
bers and the supervisors report in-
rcluded fines for several.of the “high-
knockers.”

Eu Society.

The Fumanean Literary Society
opened, its weekly meeting by the’
rolt call and the reading of the last ,
minutes. After which, devotional '
exercises were conducted by the
president and Mr. Lowry. ;

The subject for debate was, re-|
solved: “That the United States!
should adopt a system af compul-:
sory voting.”
| The affirmative side of the ques-:
tien was upheld by Messrs. Mahood
land Mellwaine while the negative |
boasted as its supporters Messrs.
J.P. Price and Paul Meng.

/ An oration on “The Future Dav.
‘ison University” was delivered by
‘Mr. PD. Miller, followed by a dee- ,
lamation entitled, “Greetings to
Armenia,” by Ogden.

The criticisms were made by Mr.
Much acumen was
shown in’ the manner in which he

pointed out the fallacies and defects
‘of the speakers.

All of the above mentioned
gentlemen displayed marked foren-
sic ability and the way in which
“Taurus” was spread about brought!
lack fond memories of Mr. R. TL Lb.
Liston and his Demostheniesian
style of oratory,

These silvery tongued scions of
rhetoric waxed eloquent and much,
credit must be given to the Public:
Speaking course at Davidson that
can produce such finished orators in
every sense of the word.

DELTA PI KAPPA HOLDS
\ FIRST REGULAR MEETING

Interesting Program Rendered.

The Delta Ti Kappa Journalistic
Fraternity held its first regular
meeting in Pi Kappa Alpha hall on,
last Wednesday night. A very in-
teresting program was carried out.

Carl J. Matthews read a very de-
tailed paper on the founding of The,
Davidsonian in 1914, by the class of
1915. The phenomenal growth of
“The Livest Wire on the Hill” was
featured, stiowing the development
from a small four column four page
