Of Pledges

This week a letter from the Dean
of Students Office was sent to the
pledge trainers of each fraternity.
This letter, after dealing with the
theory of pledge training in general,
reminded the pledge trainers of the
faculty regulations covering the
pledge programs — and then inform-
ed the pledge trainers that they would
be required by the Dean of Students’
Office to take a pledge to be honor-
bound, that “these regulations have
been fulfilled in every instance.” This
letter was sent out over the signature
of Robert G, Jones, the assistant dean
of students. ;

The assistant dean of students is
relatively new to the campus as an
administrator. We feel that he is-do-
ing a commendable job in handling
administration-student-body relation-
ships to the satisfaction of both par-
ties. Thus we are reluctant to lay the
blame for this letter at his feet —
especially because this misuse of the
honor pledge to enforce student bod
regulations is indicative of an atti-
tude, not of an individual.

The Student Body Constitution
separates the Honor System and the
Student Body Regulations and their
“respective enforcements. It is this
differentiation with which we are con-
cerned.

The concept of honor is accepted
without question — that is, it is as-
sumed necessary and desirable by
students, despite criticisms of its en-
forcement. There is a voluntary as-
sent by students to the concept of
honor. It is adhered to and enforced
by the Davidson student body.

The strength of the Honor Sys-
tem lies here: consequently the col-
lective enforcement by the studen
body. a)

The Student Body Regulations are
different in nature from the Honor
System. They reflect, not so much
student attitudes on conduct, but the -
ideas of the college on how a student
should conduct himself. The activities
covered by the Student Body Regula-
tions are not equal in gravity. Nor
can they be enforced equally or equit-
ably. <

Note the wide variety of activities
dealt with in the regulations: conduct
unbecoming a gentleman, drinking,
gambling, keeping firearms in dorms,

azing, making unnecessary noise in
dorms, damaging college property.

Preference for student — rather
than faculty — enforcement prompt-
ed the insertion of many of these
regulations into the Student Body

Constitution.

Defacing of property is certainly
accepted as an evil to be prevented .. .
Prohibition of firearms is a safety
provision . . . Making unnecessary
noise in the dorms or disturbing study-
ing conditions may not be the best
practice, but these are certainly not
equitable with defacing and damag-
ing of property. Hazing is a practice
deemed unwise — but it is certainly
not. comparable to making unneces-
Sary noise in the dorms.

All these activities covered in the
Student Body Regulations may. or may
not be deemed necessary by the col-
lege administration for the running of
this institution. The point is that not
all of these regulations are respeccted
or enforced regularly by many of the
Students in the student body. This is
natural enough, these rules are not
reflections of student body will but of
what the college wants.

This is most clearly reflected in
the enforcement of both the Honor
System and the Student Body Regula-
tions. While the Honor System is
customarily enforced fairly and swift-
ly and without dissension, the con-
duct regulations are enforced ambig-
uously, sporadically, and haphazard-
ly by the few students honor-bound
to do so, That only a few students
are honor-bound to report these vio-
lations in the first place while the
rest are only duty-bound is a tacit
admission of three factors: 1) these
regulations are not accepted by many
students, 2) these regulations are com-
plied with by considerably less than
a. majority of the students; and 3)
these regulations are almost impossi-
ble to enforce.

The situation now is that all stud-
ents are honor-bound to report Honor
System violations and some students
are honor-bound to report violations
of Student Body Regulations. The
nature of the regulations makes them
almost impossible to enforce: reflect-
ed in that most students are “exempt”
from having to report them.

We believe the students should
handle the Honor System. Student
conduct regulations, however, should
be made equitable, and enforced by
either all the students or none of the
students.

This recent letter from the Office
of the Dean of Students illustrates
yet another attempt to enforce facul-
ty and student rules of conduct with
the concept of honor used to support
the Honor System. The point is this:
both the faculty and the administra-
tion realize the effectiveness of these
regulations of conduct depends upon
their acceptance and enforcement by
the students.

These regulations of conduct are
neither accepted nor enforé
sistently by most stude
simple reason that most éfudgnts ten
to view these regulationg not as ex-
pressions of their own ideas, volun-
tarily accepted, but rather as decrees
from the college forced upon them.

And it is this viewpoint that
prompts the college to take the heart
of the Honor System—its voluntary
enforcement based on one’s honor—
and attempt to apply it to these mat-
ters of far lesser importance.

Consequently, the Dean of Stud-
ents Office is arbitrarily picking out
certain persons to be honor-bound to
enforce these far lesser matters of
student conduct, while allowing the
rest of the student body to be “ex-
empt” from this enforcement.

We feel that compelling certain
persons, whether they be either Hon-
or Court or Student Council members
or fraternity presidents or pledge
trainers, to be honor-bound to en-
force any regulations of conduct, is
wrong. We feel that it is a misuse
of a valued possession, a workable
honor system.

If the college feels that these reg-
ulations are necessary for it to control
the individual students, let them stip-
ulate these regulations as such. If
these regulations and their enforce-
ment are clearly the will and the de-
‘sire of the student body, let us have
all the students enforce them, rather
than a chosen few.

In any event, let us stop confusing
violations of honor and violations of
conduct regulations. The pledge of
honor is intended for situations in-

volving honor and not for enforcing
matters of far less consequence.

Let us at least be consistent.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

A ‘Democratic Landslide’ ld
Forecast For The Northeast 5° T

By MICHAEL L.

HARRINGTON

Davidsonian Managing Editor
Better-than-even bets are being made by the profes-
sional gamblers that Lyndon Baines Johnson will ca
every state in the industrial Northeast. Even the tradi-
tionally Republican states of Maine, Vermont, and New
Hampshire are threatened by a Democratic landslide.

There is considerable fear in
GOP ranks:‘and high hopes in
the Democratic party workers
that the expected Johnson tidal
wave of votes will wash out
at least two Republican Sena
tors and a whole host of GOP
congressmen.

The Republican Party in the
Northeast seems to be stricken
with acute schizophrenia, the
lower part of the ticket against.
the upper part as well as the
Demos—a condition more com-
mon to Southern Democrats.
The reluctance of most Republi-
can candidates for major of-
fices to mention the Goldwater
~ Miller combination has more
Democrats running against the
GOP Presidential candidate
than the local Republican hope-
fuls.

Even Miller, Vice-Presidential
candidate from New York,
seems to be regarded as a
liability to the Republican
cause,

The expected ‘‘back lash" of
white Democrats has failed to
materialize to any great ex-
tent thus far, but a “front-lash”
of Republican voters going to
Johnson, possibly 15% of the
registered Republicans, has GOP
leaders feartui for a collapse
of the party in some states.

Even if the “back-lash" is-
sue runs deeper than the polls
show, even if many nersons
are secretly planning to vote
for the Arizona Senator, John-

on still looks Mike a sure win-
ner in most Northeastern states.

DELAWARE: Depite rural
feelings for Goldwater, the
vote of heavily-urbanized New-
Castle County plus normal
Democratic support put John-
son across.

MARYLAND: Here is a state
where the white backlah should
be highest. But even here the
race is said be about even.
possibly with Johnon holding
a slight edge.

PENNSYLVANIA: Governor
Scranton isn't breaking his neck
for the national ticket; con-
sequently no one else is either.
Despite a divided Democratic
Party after a bitter Senatorial
primary and the apparent col-
lapse of the Philadelphia
machine, not only does John
son look far ahead but also GOP
Senator Hugh Scott is in real
trouble from a candidate he
ordinarily would have crushed.
NEW YORK: Once again a Re-
publican Governor has little
enthusiasm and a GOP Sena-
tor faces a strong challenge.
Goldwater loses more of what
little support he had each day.
Right now both Johnson and
Keating should be winners.

NEW JERSEY: This indust-
rial state goes overwhelmingly
for the Democratic ticket.

NEW HAMPSHIRE: Normally
Republican, this state goes
Democratic by default.

VERMONT: The race
is even.

FROM THE BACK OF THE BUS

water Victory Seen

By CHARLES RAMBERG
Yasonion Associate Editor

“I am unalterably opposed to discrimination or segregation on the basis of race,

color, or creed...” (Speech

to U. S. Senate, June 18, 1964)

Those are the words of a man who could be catapulted into the White House by

a surge of race hate.

Act of 1964, and all other civil rights statutes, to assure equal rights and opportuni-

ties guaranteed by the Constitution to every citizen; . .

point for racists.

. ” (1964 Republican Plat-

That is the platform of a party that in this election year has become a rallying

Seems incongruous, doesn’t it? , ;
At first glance, there seems little doubt that Senator Goldwater believes in hum-

an rights. In this area the record seems clear, if only because it is based on his deeds

and not on his words.

As a member of the Phoenix City Council, Goldwater voted to desegregate a rest-
aurant at Sky Harbor Airport. As chief of staff in the Arizona Air National Guard, he
ordered an end to segregation in the guard in 1952. (President Truman had banned
segregation in the U. S. armed forces in 1948.)

Barry Goldwater donated $400 to Arizona NAACP chapters in the early 1950's. He
was once a member of both the Tuscon and Phoenix chapters. Before they were sold,
the Goldwater family department stores hired Negroes, including some in supervisory

positions.

MASSACHUSETTS: The home
State of the late John F. Ken-
nedy goes to Johnson by. an
overwhelming margin. The GOP
cause is absolutely dead for
awhile in this state.

RHODE ISLAND: No con-
test. Johnson all the way.

CONNECTICUT:
take everything.

MAINE: Only here do the Re-
publicans have a decent chance
to carry a Northeastern state,
but Lyndon Johnson might be
able to break an ancient tradi-
tion and carry Maine. Still the
race looks even.

Totals for the Northeast:

GOLOWATER: 6 states with
O electoral votes.

JOHNSON: 8 states with
128 electoral votes.

EVEN: 2 states with 14
electoral votes.

(The Year Of The Clear-Cut Choice)

Angry Frosh Sounds Off
On Kimrey’s 'Good Guys’

In reference to Associate
Editor Kimrey’s opinion that
the present trend of having a
brighter freshman class each
year is undesirable, I would
like to express my belief that
he is wrong. In the college's
“Statement of Purpose,” one
of the most important goals is
to ‘seek men of the highest cali-
ber for the student body.”

I agree_ wholeheartedly:
Davidson should cont.nue its
present policy of seeking the
most. outstanding and _intelli-
gent students available. May
the day never come when Mr.
White must worry about filling
a minimum quota of Mr. Kim-
Tey’s “good guys” and “honor
society rejects” and when he
must take an applicant aside
and tactfully explain that he
is just a little bit too intelli-
gent for Davidson.

In his column Mr, Kimrey
would seems to support admit-
ting some downright average
students in order to pad the
academic lower half of the
class; these students were satis:
fied with mediocrity in high
school and therefore, should
be quite pleased to fill the same
role at Davidson. Of course
we'll let in a few top students,
but they'll be able to continue
to trun circles around their

classmates and everyone will

be happy (and isn’t this the
basic goal of college life, to
make everyone happy, happy,
happy?)

I disagree strongly, for one
of the most desirable incen-
tives any educational institu-
tion can use is the challenge.
Academic competition is a
terrific preparation for life,
for through it a person learns
to control himself and to chan-
nel his efforts in his chosen
direction.

The role of this college must
not be to prepare safe, little
“good guys” who have never
experienced life, who have
never really thrown themselves
into something bigger than
themselves (Christianity?), and
who will fill an insignificant
function in life, leaving this
world without having changed
it in the least. The Office of
Admissions must continue its
search for excellence in pros-

pective students.

Dear Editor:

As a fun-loving Democrat, I
wish to thank the Great Issues
Program and the Young Re-

publicans Club for making
Monday's Assembly speaker
available. My hope is that the
Democrats may find someone as
eloquent in defense of Mother,
God, and the Constitution, that
equal time may be rendered,

But, in a larger sense (Where
have I heard that before?), my
appreciation must go to the
Republican National Conven-
tion, for without its prudent
choice, fun-loving Democrats
and Psychology majors would
have to look elsewhere for
kicks.

Democrats:

_. How could anyone confuse the Republican nominee
with some of his rabidly racist Southern support?
Goldwater cannot fairly be labeled a racist. Yet he

.is a potential cobra by comparison with earthworms like

Alabama Gov. Wallace and Mississippi Gov. Johnson.

This stems from the fact that Barry Goldwater is at
best a halfhearted friend of human rights. Support for
this conclusion is not hard to find. At the heart of the
matter is his interpretation of the U. S. Constitution.

__ He has read the constitution in such a way that he finds
it impossible to mix his mgral beliefs with politics on the
national level. States rights keep getting in the way.

Goldwater apparently believes in equal rights, but
he can see no way to make what is obviously morally right
the law of the land.

As a result, all his fine talk about “freedom” is reduc-
ed to a hollow sham.

In the United States this election year and for the
forseeable future, the issue of freedom centers on human
rights. Specifically, it is whether. a tenth of the popula-
tion can be relegated to a second-class citizenship.

The Negro Revolution now under way has made
significant progress since World War II. If progress is to
continue, national leaders are needed who recognize the
necessity to bring the power of the U. S. government to
bear in the struggle.

Mere abstract commitment to equality is not enough
Senator Goldwater, then, threatens the momentum of the
rights movement. This fact has not been lost on the en-
emies of human rights.

It is no coincidence that
the traditional bastion of
segregation, the South, is
leaning closer to the Repub-
lican Party than it has since
Reconstruction.

It was no coincidence that
Gov. Wallace withdrew from
the presidential race after
the Goldwater nomination,
and no coincidence that Mis-
Sissippi Gov. Paul Johnson
has given his blessings to an
anti-Democrat protest vote.

How else can we explain
why the white anti-civil 2am
rights “back-lash” vote will
go to the party of Abraham
Lincoln?

The racists know that the G. 0. P. is no longer the
party that in its 1960 platform pledged “. . . the full use
of the power, resources and leadership of the federal
government to eliminate discrimination based on race,
color, religion or national origin.”

They know what the Republican nominee had to say -
apeine the 1964 Civil Rights Act shortly before he voted

“To give genuine effect to the prohibitions of this
bill will require the creation of a Federal police force of
mammoth proportions. It also bids fair to result in the
development of an ‘informer’ psychology in great areas
of our national life . . . These, the Federal police force
and an an ‘informer’ psychology, are the hallmarks of the
Police state in the destruction of a free society,” he said.

ate racists don't expect Goldwater to swallow his
words about “freedom” in order to give “genuin t’”
to the Civil Rights Act. ees © effec

An neither do we.

We and they are thinking of the Barry Goldwater
who for nearly a decade after the 1954 Supreme Court
decision (Brown v. Board ‘of Education) on public school
segregation delighted his followers by telling them that
the decision was unconstitutional.

__ We and they have found little reason in this cam-
paign to think Barry Goldwater would, if elected, use
the powers of the presidency to bring justice to race
relations.

Rather than remind us of his strong committment
to human rights, he has spent the summer talking about
violence in the streets.

Now the Republicans are
harvest of hate in the
from now. .

One commentator has said that Barry Goldwater
would have a sympathetic ear to Negro pleas. That may
be $0, but we know what the reply would be: “My hands
are tied.”

enough funds, we would use red ink to emphasize the maj-
