movement was far from any quest
for individual power with which to
later exploit the people, but that it
was “a hunger and a thirst after

To those who were able to take

debate, it-seemed that those organi-

Heels and have served as a fairly competent check on those of
Graham.

Graham, the ex-U.N.C. president who is filling the unex-
pired term of the late J. Melville Broughton, has drawn a bit
more resistance than the venerable Hoey. Among his opponents
is Bob Reynolds, former Senator from Asheville. Reynolds is
given the best chance to knock off the liberal-minded junior
Senator. Graham, though not Red-tinted in any way, has drawn
notice for his liberal views on education, medicine and other
fields of economics.

Down in Florida the senatorial race is a shade more torrid
than here. Aside from minor candidates who will barely scratch,
the race narrows down to two men: Senator Claude Pepper and
Congressman George Smathers. If this paper has been noted
for its lack of platform in the past we will at this time nail one
down. That platform is for the defeat of Claude Pepper. The
senior Senator from the Sunshine State rode into office on the
shirt tails of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938.
He started his trek to the left under F.D.R., graduated that trek
into a fast trot during the war, and is now galloping at a more
rapid pace than Harry Truman and may soon catch Henry
Wallace. .

Pepper, as usual, has been denying these charges of his
Communist sympathies during his campaign. However, his po-
sition was soundly ridiculed by a Florida columnist recently.
The writer put it this way: Pepper is like the man who hates
alcohol so much that he is trying to drink it all so that its evils
will be taken from the world. ‘‘The Pink Pepper,’’ as the Sat-
urday Evening Post calls him, will have just about as much
trouble hitting Communism with his method as the prohibition-
ists will killing alcohol.

Congressman Smathers is a young veteran of the past war.
When Pepper was first elected in 1938, Smathers headed the
campaign in his behalf on the campus of the University of
Florida. But Smathers, like many other Floridians, has had his
fill of the betrayals of Mr. Pepper. The senator will have a
rough time this trip, arid even last-minute journeys through
the swamps won't pull out enough ignorant votes to save his

seat.—J. H.

There is one final consideration.
The miner may be said to have won
the strike because his wages were

of work to recover this loss with
his 70c wage increase; or, in other
words, it will be over eight and a
half years before the increase will
have paid for itself.

But it was a costly strike to the
miner in a less direct but far more
decisive way.‘The nation has reach-

Since some have regarded his ac-
tion as a reflection on the R.O.T.C.
program at Davidson, Dr. Cun.
ningham has authorized the Da-
vidsonian to publish the following
excerpts from his letter to Colonel
Ballard of March 7, 1950.

“Let me make it doubly clear
that I lent my approval to that
statement not through any disap-
proval of the R,O.T.C. program at
Davidson. Indeed I did not intend
that it should have any bearing on
the local situation. While the R. O.
T. C. is mentioned in the stata-
ment, it has to do with situations
which do not prevail at Davidson.
Perhaps I should have foreseen that
there would naturally be some ques-
tion involved. It is my considered
opinion that the R.O.T.C. Unit at
Davidson has not at any time been
more effective nor have relations
between the local Unit and the Col.
lege been more open and more co-
operative. This would hold with
reference to the Third Army Head.

“The chief caution which is in-
tended in this booklet is the grad<
ual enlargement of military expen-
ditures and influence in our univer-
sities and land-grant colleges. Very
large sums of money running into
tens of millions of dollars are being
appropriated by the Army, Navy,
and Air Force and by the Atomic
Energy Commission for military
programs and research in institu-
tions of higher education. As these
institutions become dependent up-
on such appropriations, they are
likely to lose their independence,
which to my mind is essential for
the best of education.

interested.

Salesmen never give him any
trouble once they run up against
his sales resistance. Paul says that
they try to sell him everything but
they soon find out that the only
thing he won't say no to is a free
sample. So far he claims he has
received several pipes, cigarettes,
chewing gum and a _ wristwatch;
but nobody has offered him any
free liquor.

Coke machines are his biggest
source of revenue and the faculty
even claims the machine in Cham-
bers is trained to short change.
Paul explained, “Some people are
just as tight as I am and try to get
a coke for a penny,” And he added
licking his lips, “That’s when I
make my money.”

The only request that has ever
stymied Paul was at Mid-Winters
when two girls asked for beers. He
told them he was all out right at
the moment.

When I got ready to leave Paul
