Architect’s Drawing of New Dormitory

FOR TWO NEW DORMITORIES

The foundations for the two new dor-|
mitories are being laid by the general
Blythe and Isenhour, of
Charlotte, N. C. The two buildings are
exact duplicates, making possible many

stories high and will be built of the best

The new dormitories will be heated
from the central heating plants, plans for
which have been drawn by C. Ferber
White, of Charlotte, representing the
Warren-Webster Co. The contract for

Electricians began work Monday. The

buildings will be wired as built. The

hardware contract will be let soon. An
extra heavy type will be used. ‘There
will be a master-key for each building

jand an individual key for each room.

All of the structural steel for the build-
ings and the ornamental iron work will
be. furnished by the Tolbert Co., of
Charlotte, representing Truscon and
other steel firms. ‘This contract is a
rather large one, as iran stairways will
be used,

Each room will be well lighted and
ventilated, for it will have two large win-
cows. All of the sash, doors and other
millwork will be furnished by J. H.
Wearn & Co., of Charlotte, one of the
largest millwork firms in the state.

Already enough has been done to en-
able a lively imagination to picture these
buildings as they will be next September.
Soon.the concrete frame with its outer
and inner walls of brick will rise. Con-
crete floors will be laid, to be covered
with wood later. These floors will be
three or four feet thick and so will ren-
der the building practically fireproof
and soundproof. If a fire should start
in any one room it could only burn
through the wooden veneer on the floor,
to be stopped by the thick concrete un-
derneath, 2

As has been stated, the new dormi-
tories will be modern in every respect.
There will be a lavatory room on each
floor, Ample shower baths are provided
in the basement. Closets ample for all
needs are provided in each room. .

Many applications are being made for
rooms every weck. It would seem that
the whole campus wants to change its
place of residence next year. When the
first call for chapel sounds next Septem-
ber a crowd of some two hundred and
thirty upperclassmen and perhaps a few
freshmen will pour from the doors of the
twins to wend their hasty way to
Shearer.

_|DAVIDSON MAKES PLANS

FOR CENTRAL
HEATING SYSTEM

For many years Davidson has been
badly in need of an adequate heating
system. There is a central heating plant,
but it is not of sufficient capacity to
heat even the few buildings that are now
connected up with it. A plant to ade-
quately heat all of the buildings on the
campus and any that’ might be added in
the near future has long been the goal
of the college authorities.

It would seem that at last this goal has
been attained, for C. Ferber White, of
Charlotte, resident sales engineer of the
Warren-Webster Co., has been author-
ized to draw up plans for a system to
embrace the entire campus. As yet the
construction contract has not been let:

The plant will probably be located
back of and a little boynd new dormi-
tory number two. From it steam lines
will radiate that will girdle the campus.
From these main lines feeders will enter
ali of the buildings on the campus. These
lines are of sufficient capacity to handle
any additional burden that will likely be
Pees on them for years to come. Spe-

ial provision is made for the new Cham-
bers building.

_ The steam lines will be covered with
heat-retaining coverings distributed by
the General Equipment Co., of Charlotte.
It is expected that their “Undabestos”

e

will be quite largely used.

While visiting the South recently, a|f

traveler chanced upon a resident of a
sleepy hamlet in Alabama.
“Are you a native of this town?” asked

the traveler.

“Am I what?” languidly asked the one
addressed.

.“Are you a native of this town?”

“What's that?”

At this juncture there appeared at the
open door of the cabin the man’s wife,
tall, sallow and gaunt. After a careful
survey of the questioner, she _ said,
“Ain’t you got no sense, Bill? He means
was you livin’ heah when yo’ was born,
or was yo’ born before yo’ begun livin’
héah. Now answer him.”

A well-known lawyer is telling a good
story about himself and his efforts to
correct the manners of his office boy.
One morning, not long ago, the young

autocrat blew into his office and tossing i

his cap at a hook, exclaimed: “Say, Mr.
Blank, there’s a ball game at the park
today and I’m going.”

Now the attorney is not a hard-hearted
man, and was willing the boy should go,
but thought he would teach him a little
lesson in good manners.

“Jimmie,” he said, “that isn’t the way
to ask a favor. Now you come: over
here and sit down and I'll show you how
to do it.”

The boy took the office chair and his

employer picked up his cap and stepped |
outside, He then opened the door softly |

and holding the cap iti’ his ‘hand said
quietly to the small boy in the big chair:

“Please, sir, there is a ball game at the

park today; if you can spare me I would|}f

like to get away for the afternoon.”

In a flash the boy responded: “Why
certainly Jimmie, and here is fifty cents
to pay your way in.”
