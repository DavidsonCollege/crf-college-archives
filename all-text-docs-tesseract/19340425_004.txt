HALVERSTADT STATE
TENNIS CHAMP

SSS

Felix renders his loudest grow! of
the week to Jimmy Halverstadt for
the excellent performance he turned in
at the State Tennis Tournament staged
on the University of North Carolina
courts last Thursday, Friday and Sat-
urday. The apparent ease with which
Jimmy marched through these three
days of play is particularly noteworthy.
He played five matches throughout the
tourney without losing a single set,
and only John Higgins, Duke No. 2
man, was able to force him into extra
game sets. Barney Welch, first rank-
ing Duke star, was the other finalist,
and if the score of this match is a
true indication of their playing, he gave
the Davidson ace little trouble in his
quest for the championship.

It was only fair that Halverstadt
and Lafferty dropped the doubles
title to Welch and Higgins after
four sets, because these Blue Dev-
ils deserved something for being
humiliated by the masterful Wild-
cat netmen in the singles. We
would have been very grateful if
these boys had come through on
top, but so long as Carolina was
left with only a bunch of messed
up courts this corner is satisfied.
Those Tar Heels have made a
clean sweep in the State net tour-
ney every season for the past half
decade, so the time is certainly ripe
for them td quit hoggin’ it.

Ras Evans truly made the cinders
fly in Miles Stadium at Blacksburg
Saturday, when he won three races
and tied for first in another, in the
track meet with Virginia Tech. I un-
derstand he was clearly in front on
the century, but near the finish there
were two marks about five yards apart,
and the Davidson sprinter, thinking
the tape to be stretched at the first
line, made a leap for it, which slowed
him down enough to allow the V. P. I.
opponent time for a tie before they
crossed the second mark, where the
string actually was, He garnered 19
points in spite of this misfortune, which
is a record number for this particular
arena and_will no doubt remain so for
many meets to come,

All of the Wildcat tracksters
came through quite nobly in this
encounter, as well as the centen-
nial rep tatives. Johnny Pearce
made the best heave in the javelin
event that any Davidson field man
has been able to do since Coble
established the school record in
1931 of 180 feet, 2 inches. Johnny’s
throw covered more than 175 feet,
which is a good distance for any
college sophomore.

Now that the brighter side of the
Wildcat’s lair has been surveyed, it
behooves tis to get.a glimpse of the
men on the diamond, who thus far
have done little more than cast a shad-
ow of gloom over its interested fans.
Can it be true that these men are play-
ing for personal glory rather than to
win for the institution they represent,
the coach,®and a decent team record?
Do the players have the necessary
confidence in their pitchers, and do the
hurlers feel that they will always re-
ceive the’ best support possible from
their, teammates? It’s hard to admit
that Davidson simply doesn’t have a
winning ball team, and I don’t think
that is the case, even though the rec-
ord so far would make one have such
an impression, but I do believe this
Wildcat nine could muster more team
spirit and self-assurance than has been
displayed in its contests during the first
part of the season. The let-down from
last year is a little more disappointing
than we had expected, and hence it
is more difficult to understand, but
faith in Coach Laird and his charges
hasn’t been entirely abandoned.

Davidson students will have a
chance to see the finalists of both
the singles and doubles in the State
tennis tourney meet again when
the Duke Blue Devils engage the
Wildcats on the local courts
Thursday afternoon.

A third college record was broken
in the field events during the meet at
V. P. I, when John Lee added two
and three-quarters inches to the pole
vault height. He pulled himself over
the bar at 11 feet, 834 inches, whereas
the old mark was 11 feet, 6 inches.

Lose Three Games
During Past Week

Baseball Nine Drops Games to
Carolina and Wake
Forest

DEACONS WIN TWICE

Harris and Jenkins Pitch Against
Wake Forest

The Davidson College baseball team
tan up against unusually stiff opposi-
tion last week, losing three games to
their Big Five opponents, The first
contest was dropped to the University
of North Carolina, 9 to 0, while the
two remaining games ended 11 to 7
and 4 to 1 in favor of the Wake For-
est Demon Deacons. One other con-
test, which was scheduled with Caro-
lina last Tuesday, was called off be-
cause of the weather.

Carolina, 9; Davidson, 0
Carolina defeated Davidson for the
third consecutive time in a game played
at Chapel Hill Wednesday. The Tar
Heels, led by the hitting of Gus Mclver
and Captain George Brandt, apparently
had little trouble in maintaining their
Big Five and Conference
leadership,

Southern

Ernest MecKeithan, Carolina pitcher,
limited the 'Cats to six scattered hits,
while his teammates used Richardson
of Davidson for a total of 16 safeties
and scored in six out of eight innings.
Gus Mclver led the Carolinay attack
with a single, double, and triple in four
trips at the bat. Captain Brandt ac-
counted for the most spectacular play
of the game with a beautiful running
catch of a foul that dropped in the
middle of a mass of players on the
bench.
Wake Forest, 11; Davidson, 7

In the first of a two-game series on
Richardson Field Friday, the Wake
Forest Demon Deacons eked out an
11 to 7 victory over the Wildcats.
Charlie Harris occupied the mound for
Davidson, striking out five men and
allowing only 11 hits during the game.
Johnny Mackorell accounted for a
three-bagger while Jim Morgan came
second in the hitting department for
the ‘Cats with a two-base hit.

For Wake Forest, Mitchell, Patton
and Alexander led with two runs each.
Alexander knocked the only home run
of the game. The Deacons took ad-
vantage of the errors made~by the
‘Cats and together with 11 hits, easily
made up for the difference in scores.

Junior Team Advances
In Intramural Sports

In the intramural baseball games of
the past. week the Junior team was
the most successful, winning two
games and losing none.

They beat the Freshmen, 11-6, on
Thursday, and on Monday they
swamped the Seniors, 19-9 .Dewey
Hutchins pitched both gamés for the
Juniors, while Bill Pritchard and
Benny Garrison pitched for the yearl-
ings, and T. Hooke McCallie hurled
for the Seniors. The last part of the
Freshman game on Thursday was
played in a pouring rain.

On Wednesday afternoon the Soph-
omores defeated the Seniors, 6-4, in
a closely fought battle. T. Hooke Mc-
Callie also pitched this game for the
Seniors, and Benfield was on the
mound for the second-year men.

Yesterday afternoon the Sophomores
met the Freshmen in the final game
of this tournament, but the results of
this game were not available when the
paper went to press.

In the second tennis match of the
intramural series, the Sophomores de-
feated the Seniors, 4-1. The members
of the Sophomore team iare Addison
Brenizer, George Hornbeck, Jake Mor-
row, and John Walker. The Senior
team is composed of Wilbur Fugate,
Mack Holland, Palmer Kirkpatrick,
and Charlie Rives. Four of these
matches were singles and the other
was doubles,

Each team will meet the representa-
tive from every other class twice dur-
ing the tournament.

’Cat Golfers Lose
Match With Duke

Linksmen Are Decisively Defeat-
ed by 1514-214 Score

The Duke University golf team made
a clean sweep in its match with the
Davidson linksmen last Saturday on
the Carolina course in Charlotte, win-
ning 15%-2%.

Cliff Perry, of Winston-Salem, Duke
sophomore, came out low man in the
18-hole match with a classy 74, netting
a steady 37 for each nine. Bill Cannon,
Davidson sophomore player, had the
lowest score for nine holes, getting a
36 for the first nine; he was unable
to repeat this score on his second
round, however.

The results of the match are as fol-
lows: Perry (3) defeated Barnes (0);
Powell (3) defeated Bowman (0);
Perry and Powell (3) defeated Barnes
and Bowman (0); Sullivan (2%) de-
feated Hamrick (1%); Budd (2) defeat-
ed Cannon (1); Sullivan and Budd (2)
defeated Hamrick and Cannon (1).
Total: Duke 15%; Davidson 2%.

The Davidson golfers deft today on
a four-day trip to Chapel Hill, Dur-
ham and Raleigh, where they will play
three successive matches, topping them
off by competing in the State Inter-
collegiate Golf Tournament.

This afternoon the Wildcats engage
the Carolina golf team at Chapel Hill.
Tomorrow they will be given a second
crack at the Duke Blue Devils, whom
they will play in Durham. Friday,
N. C. State will be met in Raleigh, and
on Saturday the State Tournament will
be held, probably on the Hope Valley
course, located between Chapel Hill
and Durham,

The order in which the men of the
Davidson team will play had not been
decided at the time this paper went to
press, but Bowman, Barnes, Hamrick
and Cannon will no doubt see serv-
ice. The Wildcats have done them-
selves justice against strong competi-
tion so far this year, and they still
have most of the season before them.

Freshman Tennis Team
Visits Ellsworth Vines

After having been rained out of the
tennis meet with the Charlotte High
tennis team, the Davidson frosh team
trooped over to the Charlotte Hotel to
try to get a glimpse of Big Bill Tilden
and Ellsworth Vines, who were in
Charlotte to play a match on their
professional tour of the United States.
Tilden went out one entrance of the
hotel about the same time the team
entered the other, but due to the per-
severance of Henry Cassidy, they final-
ly got permission to see Vines.

Ed Garrett, manager of the Centen-
nial team, was the first to enter the
room of the famous Vines, greeting
him with a “ Hi, Vines, old boy,” while
the members of the team timidly lin-
gered outside. However, Vines was
very friendly and said he was always
glad to see people who were interested
in tennis.

When asked about—Jimmy Halver-
stadt, Vines immediately said he had
heard about the ability of the Wild-
cat star and hoped he would succeed
in winning the state intercollegiate ten-
nis tournament. He also complimented
the Davidson varsity team on their
record this year and was greatly sur-
prised to hear that the Wildcats had
defeated Georgia Tech.

The following night at the Charlotte
Armory-Auditorium, Vines defeated
* Big Bill” Tilden,the old master of
the courts, in a fast match before a
crowd of 1,500 spectators. Both play-
ers were at top form and since noth-
ing depended on the match, displayed
some fast and terrific tennis.

The match was played on a canvas-
covered floor, which added to the fast-
ness of the game. The preliminary
to the contest was played between
Gledhill and Chapin and was won by
the former, 6-2, 6-1.

G

Named After Coach

While the track teams were at
V. P. 4. last week-end some of
the boys had the privilege of
visiting a few of the interesting
places around the campus of the
Virginia institution. Among these
was the dairy barn where several
hundred very fine head of cattle
are kept and milked by the stu-
dents in the agricultural school,
and one of these animals, the
most contented looking of the
herd, so they report, is named
“Monk” for the former Wildcat
mentor, Monk Younger, who
left Davidson in 1932 to take a
position on the coaching staff at
the Blacksburg school,

Freshmen Nine Wins
Over Belmont Abbey

Score First Win by Defeating
Catholic Nine 8-2

Departing from their usual form, the
Wildkitten baseball team broke into
the win column for the first time this
season by virtue of an 8-2 victory over
the Belmont Abbey nine. The game
was played) Thursday afternoon on
Richardson Field,

Improved fielding and hitting and
three-hit pitching by “Lefty” Porter
were the main factors that wrought
the change in the score board. Porter
struck out eight men and allowed no
hits after the third_inning. He was
well supported by his teymmates, who
gathered ten hits while making~only
one error,

Leading the little ‘Cats at bat was
Jim Dickson, frosh catcher, who hit
three times out of four trips. Corbin
and Shemwell also#starred, gaining a
double and a single each. Kerman was
the satellite for the visitors and re-
sponsible for both their runs.

In the third inning Davidson hopped
on Kearns for two hits which, coupled
with two errors, two sacrifices and a
walk, scored three runs. Belmont
tallied once in both the first and third
innings. Due to rain, the game lasted
only seven and one-half innings.

Batteries for Davidson were Porter
and Dickson; for Belmont, Kearns and
Campbell. Davidson smashed out ten
hits, gained eight runs and made one
error, Belmont got two runs on three
hits and made seven errors.

The freshmen did not fare so well
in a practice game with a team from
Cornelius, losing 7-2, Allowed only
four hits by Sherrill, the "Kittens made
two runs and one error, while the
team from Cornelius touched Gracey
for nine hits and seven runs. A home
tun by McConnell in the second in-
ning was the scoring feature of the
day. Batteries for Davidson were
Gracey and Lanier; for Cornelius,
Sherrill and Howard.

The Wildkittens ‘play Newton
Wednesday, Campbell College Thurs-
day, and Louisburg College Saturday,
all games to be played on Richardson
Field.

Tar Heels Defeat
’Cat Tennis Team

Davidson Wins One Singles; Two
Doubles Matches

After a very successful season of
ten consecutive victories, the Davidson
Wildcat tennis team was defeated by
the University of North Carolina net-
men last Wednesday afternoon by a
score of 6 to 3. The match was played
on the courts at Chapel Hill and two
Davidson players remained to take
part in the state tournament which
started on Thursday.

Collectively, the Tar Heel team was
superior to the Wildcats, as can be
evidenced by the score, but Jimmy
Halverstadt, playing the number one
position for Davidson, carried off the
individual honors. Maintaining his
championship form, he decisively
trounced Harris of Carolina, 6-2, 6-1.
Davidson's No. 3 doubles team, com-
posed Barnett and Scott, alsg
showed up well in winning their match.

of

Tennis at Carlina has been notable
in the past, as national honors have
been won for several years, but the
loss of such stars as Wilmer Hines and
Lenoir Wright has considerably weak-
ened this aggregation. During the past
several years, Cafolina teams have
amassed a total of almost one hundred
victories and incurred no defeats. In
acquiring this excellent record, they
have defeated many outstanding east-
ern teams from colleges and universi-
ties larger than Carolina. It was hoped
that Davidson, with its strong team
this year, would be the first to defeat
the Tar Heels after their long reign
in North Carolina, but the Wildcats
were defeated after putting up a fine
struggle to the last. Davidson meets
Carolina again this séason in another
attempt.

The summary is as follows:

Singles: Halverstadt (D) defeated
Harris (C), 6-2, 6-3. Willis (C) defeat-
ed Thompson (D), 6-3, 6-2. Levitan
(C) defeated Lafferty (D), 6-2, 7-5.
Morgan (C) beat Barnett (D), 6-4, 6-4,
Minor (C) beat Lewis (D), 6-1, 6-4.
McGlinn (C) defeated Scott (D), 6-2,
6-3,

Doubles: Halverstadt and Lafferty
defeated Harris and Willis, 6-3, 6-1.
Levitan and Morgan beat Thompson
and Lewis, 6-1, 6-3, Barnett and Scott
beat Minor and McGlinn, 6-3, 4-6, 8-6.

HOW THEY STAND

The Davidson Wildcats and the
North Carolina Wolfpack are still
trailing in the Big Five baseball race.
The Carolina Tar Heels are ahead of
the other schools in the state, having
a perfect record. Duke and Wake

place, both having won three games
and lost one.
