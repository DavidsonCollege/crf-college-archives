M/SGT. JOHN P. BUTTS

Master Sergeant John P. Butts,
who is now an Assistant Instructor
in MS, II at Davidson College R.0.
T. C. Headquarters, enlisted in the
army in February, 1940 at Fort
Bragg, N. C.

Almost immediately Sgt. Butts
was sent to Panama with the 14th
Infantry Division and remained
there for a little over three years.
In June, 1943, Sgt. Butts was sent
back to Camp Carson, Colorado,
where he was to stay only three
months before being sent back ov-
erseas.

M. Sgt. Butts, in September, 1943,
left for the China-Burma-India
Theater as a member of the now
famous ‘Merrill's Marauders”
which was the first Infantry Unit
to serve in Asia during World War
fl. “Merrill's Marauders” won quite
a name for themselves as a fight-
ing unit during the time that they
harassed the Japanese troops in
the C.B.I. Theater. The unit was
formed to fight behind enemy lines
and keep the enemy troops busy
so that they could not continue
with their conquest of the Far
East.

After approximately a year and
a half, Sgt. Butts returned to the
United States and was stationed at
Camp Gordon, Georgia until he was
discharged on October, 1945.

Sgt. Butts immediately reenlist-
ed and between October, 1945 and
January, 1947 was moved from Fort
Bliss, Texas to Fort McClellan, Ala-
bama to Fort Bragg, N. C. In Jan-
uary, 1947 M. Sgt. Butts was sent
to Japan with the 19th Infantry
Regiment of the 24th Division. Af-
ter a year and a half in Japan, he
was sent back to Fort Jackson,
South Carolina, where he remain-
ed until January, 1950.

From Fort Jackson, Sgt. Butts
was given his first assignment to
Davidson College. In February,
1953, he was sent to the Far East
for the third time in his army ca-
reer. This time Sgt. Butts went to
Korea with the 14th Regiment of
the 25th Division. In August of last
summer Sgt. Butts was pulled out
of Korea and came to Davidson
College for his second assignment
here on October 18, 1954.

Sergeant Butts now lives with
his wife and son in Cornelius, N. C.

Commission.

After the war, during which he
rose to a colonel in the Air Force
and won several medals, he return-
ed to Davidson as @ professor of
political science. In 1949 he was
made athletic director at which
post he served until recalled to
active duty. Since his second re-
turn to civilian life he has been
General Counsel for the American
Trucking Association, Inc.

We all know the importance of
transportation, especially the rail-
road, in the building of our nation.
We also know of the growth of
trucking, how it has hurt the rail-
road, and how the railroad is now
fighting to regain some of its lost
carrying trade. Lately there has
been much controversy over the
railroads’ plan of carrying trailer
trucks on flat cars from city to
city.

Mr. Pinkney and Mr. Henry are
sure to provide many interesting
comments and sidelights on these
and other important issues be-
tween the truckers and the rail-
roaders. Opportunity for questions
and answers will be given after the
address of these speakers.

All students are urged to at-
tend, for this will be a very inter-
esting and educational program,
and could prove quite exciting.
Refreshments will be served at the
end of the meeting.

The dedication service will be

the formal opening of the com-

Negro community. After the ser-

_|vice there will be an open house,

with refreshments being served by
the ladies of the community, for
all who care to inspect the build-
ing. All members of the Davidson
community are invited to attend.

It was before the Second World
War that the Davidson College
Y.M.C.A. turned over the money
raised by the Christmas Gift Fund
for the building of a sorely need-
ed community center. After much
hard use for many years, it was
decided by the College student
body that they wanted to help re-
condition the Center, making it a
place that could be used and en-
joyed by persons of all ages.

A lot was purchased from Mr. J.
R. Caldwell on Graham Street and
the old Center was moved to its
present site. Mr. Floyd Ballard con-
tracted to renovate the building,
and extensive repairs were made.
In addition, a section was added
which now provides two bathrooms
and a store room. Other additions
have been made in terms of equip-
ment, for example, folding chairs
and tables, gas furnace, electric

school room and com-
raham Street, Davidson.

stove and refrigerator, etc.

John Withers Is at present Chair-
man of the Community Center’s
Board of Control and has put much
of his own labor, along with that
of friends, into the building. The
Board of Control is thinking about
beginning a Teen Age Club for
the young people of the com-
munity, with the help of the Col-
lege Y.M.C.A. Other possible pro-
jects are being considered by the
Board at the present time. Policies
for the use of the Community Cen-
ter will be announced at a later
date by the Board.

Nemed For Alumnus

The Community Center is nam-
ed after Mr. David McLean who
was a student at Davidson Col-
lege at the time of the building
of the Community Center. He, as
YM.C.A. Cabinet member in
charge of Colored Work, was one
of the main forces behind the
drive to raise funds for the Center
and spent much of his time work-
ing with the young people of the
community. Because he was be-
loved by the community, the Com-
munity Center was named for him.
Mr. McLean is at the present time
a missionary in Africa.

Peddlers Forbidden
On Davidson Campus

College regulations prohibit the
solicitation of Davidson College
students in the selling of any type
of merchandise. This announce-
ment was made by college authori-
ties this week in the face of re-
ports that a number of students
and outsiders have been going from
room to room in their. selling ef-
forts and that they have also been
approaching other students at the
College Union and at other places
on the campus.

The regulations against any form
of solicitation were put into effect
many years ago at the request of
the students because of the great
amount of time lost in dealing wi
an endless succession of salesmen
with all types of merchandise.

On Segregation

There are those who say that
constant dripping will wear away
the hardest stone. However, there
are stones here that have been
here a lot longer than some of the
drips.

in limiting his opportunities in re-
lation to the opportunities of other
students in the same school.

It-becomes evident that the Su-
preme Court has left the realm
of tangible inequalities and has
become a judge of intangible in-
equalities. According to Dr. Dabbs,
time alone was necessary for the
court to proclaim what was already
evident, that equality must mean
what it says both on the college
and the grade school level.

A Southern Problem

At 7:30 Wednesday evening the
Reverand Beverly Asbury of the
Zebulon, N. C., Baptist Church
joined Dr. Dabbs in speaking to
a group of about 60 Davidson stu-
dents, professors and townspeople.
In his evening address Dr. Dabbs
presented the facts on what the
south is doing at present about
the decision. He pointed out that
four states in the south are oppos-
ing the decision overtly, that four

day Parade in Kannapolis on No-
vember 30th.

This will mark the first time in
some five years that the Regiment
has taken part in a parade off the
campus. ROTC leaders hope that
the parade will not only have a
good public relations effect for the
College but will also be a means
for building morale and “esprit de
corps” within the ROTC unit.

High enthusiasm on the part of
the Cadet Corps has already been
shown in the good response given
the appeal for volunteers for the
marching unit which will be sent
to the parade.

Davidson ROTC units participat-
ing in the parade, which will have
approximately 80 other units, are
the ROTC Band, commanded by
Cadet Captain Haywood Rogers,
the Regimental Color Guard, and
the marching unit of 80 sophomore
cadets, commanded by Cadet Cap-
tain George M. Canon. Assisting
in the operation are Cadet Lieu-
tenants William M. Heston, Jr.,
Robert B. Dalton, Stratton N. Ster-
ghos, and Emmanuel G. Sfaelos.

Transportation to and from Kan-
napolis for the event will be fur-
nished by 2%-ton trucks from the
Army Motor Pool in Charlotte.
General arrangements for the op-
eration were handled by Cadet
Colonel Cooper, Captain Lee R.
Brown and Lt. Colonel John D.
Sapp of the Davidson ROTC.

Chorus and Ensemble
Appear In Charlotte

The Davidson College Male
Chorus and Brass Ensemble will
give their first combined perform-
ance at the Covenant Presbyterian
Church in Charlotte this Sunday af-
ternoon at five o'clock. The pro-
gram is to include selections of
early church music, several Bach
selections, several Russian selec-
tions and a few Christmas num-
bers.

This is the first time this year
that either of these organizations
has given a concert off campus and
also the first time that they have
ever given a combined program.

{h |The Chorus is under the direction

of Mr. Donald Plott, and the Brass
ensemble is directed by Mr. J. P.
Satterfield. Mr. J. T. Fesperman
will be the organist for the group.
Sunday evening, both the Male
Chorus and the Chapel Choir will
furnish the vocal music for Ves-
pers. This will be the first time
this semester that the two choral
groups have sung together. The
music will consist mainly of
Thanksgiving selections.

Pointing out several factors in
the world which doom segregation
to a losing struggle, Dr. Dabbs
stated that the south in looking
backward has waited to oppose in-
tegration until it is too late. The
Communist challenge, movements
among the world’s colored peoples
for equality, and our own belief
in and leadership in democratic
ideals have marked defeat from
the start for any attempts we might
make to stop integration.

Mr. Asbury, speaking from the
background of living in a typical
southern small town of average
Negro population, addressed those
present to problems that face such
an environment in the decision.

Stressing the fact that one must
know his community before he
can understand its problems, Mr.
Asbury said that the greatest prob-
lem in his town was the problem
of misinformation and lack of fac-
tual information on the part of
white people. He stated that the
effect of such misinformation is a
low estimate of the Negro.

School systems do not help to
alleviate prejudice and to educate
the young as to the problem, Mr.
Asbury stated. Rather they leave

Five Are Disciplined

For Dormitory Trouble

At a special meeting of the Stu-
dent Council Tuesday night five
students were disciplined for cre-
ating disturbances in the dormitor-
ies. One student was acquitted of
a similar charge.

Two students were placed on
probation as regards conduct in
the dormitories for playing a radio
excessively loud late at night.
Three students were given a short
campus, a small fine, and a letter
home, in addition to probation con-
cerning dormitory conduct for re-
moving and breaking bottles.

the issue untouched, or worse, they
add unwittingly to the existing
prejudice.

As to method of integration, Mr.
Asbury pointed up a definite pos-
sibility of race riots with either
immediate or gradual integration.
He intimated that precipitous in-
tegration would perhaps cause less
difficulty in the long run than a
slow, continously annoying process.

Directing his attention to the
church and segregation, Mr. As-
bury pointed up the inevitable
cleavage in membership and the
accompanying danger of church
splits and dismissal of ministers.
He brought out the church’s weak-
ness in failing to apply the Gospel
to education of its children in con-
temporary social problems such as
segregation.

In proposing a solution to the
problem Mr. Asbury proposed
study groups and interracial groups
working together to solve prob-
lems common to both races. As an
example of such interracial co-
operation he mentioned working
together to establish recreational
facilities in municipalities. A test
area willing to undergo integration
and a study of the problems which
would arise would also aid in solv-
ing the problem as a whole, Dr.
Asbury asserted. He suggested
Greensboro, N. C., as a likely place
for such an experiment.

A Davidson Problem

Davidson College, a church re-
lated institution whose trustees
come from the synods of North
Carolina and Florida, is not free
from the problem of segregation
on the grounds of being a non
state school. When the General
Assembly of the Presbyterian

are to be handed in at the College
Union desk no later than Novem-
ber 30. Those photographs which
will be entered in the beauty sec-
tion of the annual will be selected
from the entries by a prominent
outsider whose name has not yet
been disclosed.

As in past years, student body
approval is necessary for the print-
ers to personalize the yearbooks

a majority are in favor of this addi-
tion.

Want Frat Snaps
“All fraternities are urged to be
taking various activity pictures, be-
cause in the past the staff has
found a lack in both quantity and
quality of fraternity informals,” an-
nounced Swain Loy, editor of this

year’s Quips and Cranks.

Many students who failed to or-
der additional photographs from
Smith Studios of Raleigh at the
time when proofs were shown have
expressed desires to do so. Prints
may be secured by placing orders
with Swain Loy or Bill Jenkins.

Freshmen, Too

All freshmen interested in work.
ing on the Quips and Cranks staff
are asked to sign up at the College
Union desk. Typists are much
needed and boys-not yet working
in any type of extra-curricular ac-
tivity are especially urged to par-
ticipate in the production of this
year’s annual.

Church, U. C., met in Montreat,
N. C., early in the summer it voted
to urge synods to adopt a policy
of opening the doors of their col-
leges and schools to all races. ©

A follow-through on this appeal
by the General Assembly would
mean that Davidson would be
among the first undergraduate
schools in the state (indeed in the
south) to admit Negroes. The prob-
lem of what basis the Negro will
be admitted on would be one for
prolonged investigation.

Six Davidsonians
Attend Student Meet

Six student leaders left Thurs-
day to attend the State Student
Legislature in Raleigh. Meeting in
the Capitol, the legislature began
sessions Thursday afternoon and
will continue through Saturday
morning.

Buddy Dye, Floyd Feeney, Swain

Loy, Clyde Robinson, Jeff Smith,
and Stuart Vaughn are represent-
ing Davidson at the legislature.
The legislature is composed of
representatives from all of North
Carolina colleges. It contains an
upper and lower house and is de-
signed to allow leaders of the var-
fous student bodies to meet and
discuss common problems and is-
sues confronting students in gen-
eral. .
Davidson has participated in the
legislature to some extent in the
past, but is sending a full dele-
gation this year for the first time
in recent years.

year engineering course, is to bet-
ter prepare the engineering stu-
dant for his chosen profession.

Dr. Karl Compton, former Pres- _
ident of the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, was one of the
initiators of this trend. He felt
that the technical institutions can
train students in technical aspects
but they also need a good back-
ground in the arts. There are now
dozens of ranking technical schools
in the United States which have
affiliated with outstanding liberal
arts schools in forming three-two
educational programs.

Dr. C. J. Pietenpol, Dean of the
Faculty of Davidson College and
coordinator of the programs with
Columbia University and Georgis
Tech, has had considerable experi-
ence with three-two programs. Dr.
Pietenpol served as coordinator of
the three-two programs at Wash-
ington and Jefferson College which
was the first institution to be se-
lected for affiliation with both
M.LT. and the Carnegie Institute.

Later, when Washington and
Jefferson founded its own school
of engineering, Dr. Pietenpol serv-
ed as Dean of Engineering for that
institution.
