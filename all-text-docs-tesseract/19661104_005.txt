UNC will be particularly strong with
harriers Mike Williams and Goodwin Tru-

four-mile course. Don Jayroe of ECC ran
the course in 20:40.

WANTED: A GUIDING LIGHT

From a gym veiled by the cloud of secrecy come
the reports that the Wildcat varsity was soundly trounced
by the freshmen Wednesday night, much to the chagrin
of Coach Lefty Driesell. While not giving any weight to
this report (though it came from a reputable source) it
seems to confirm opinions of some of us that something
is missing from this year’s edition of the “Darlings of
Dixie Basketball,” to quote my journalistic friend in the
gym, super-SID.

Judging from the scrimmage Saturday, it’s obvious

_|that the intangible quality missing is leadership. There

‘CATS’ WINNING GOAL

Pembroke, Wildcats

p.m. when the 'Cats host Pembroke.

Last season the booters’ white-
washed Pembroke 8-0. This year
Pembroke may provide a few
surprises for the fakey Fogle-
men, since they downed St. An
drews, who in turn whipped Da
vidson.

Wednesday saw the Foglemen
survive an overtime to upset
Pfeiffer 4-3 here. Wing Jim Mar-
row scored on a 40-yard boot
with 50 seconds left in the first
overtime to edge out the Fal-
cons.

The ‘Cats jumped to an early
lead when Captain George Brown
booted in a goa! from the edge
of the goalie circle. Marrow
added another tally from just
inside the penalty area to give
the Foglemen a 2.0 halftime
lead.

In the third quarter Bill Dut-|

ten connected to put Pfeiffer on
the scoring charts. Marrow then
boosted the Davidson margin to
3-1 with a goal with a minute
gone in the final period.

Ross Hagstoz led the Pfeiffer
comeback, scoring first on a
penalty kick with 6:30 niinutes
left. and then later with 2:50 on
the clock. to send the. game into}
overtime..

“Brown played an outstanding |
game.” said Fogleman, ‘He fol :

In their third win of the sea-

Appalachian team 2-1 Jast Fri-
day.

Alter a scoreless first quar
ter, halfback Charlie Cameron
tallied on a corner shot. Appa-
Jach’an tied it up in the third
quarter after a fast break up
the middle.

Davidson's winning goal came
in the final period when Alec
Neister headed in a pass from
halfback Mac Fiddner.

isn't a Dick Snyder or a Fred Hetzel or a Terry Holland
or a Bill Jarman this year. When there aren’t any seniors
on your team, the juniors must carry the burden of lead-
ing the sophomores. The one junior who ¢ould have sup-
plied the necessary guidance this year turned to other
fields of endeavor.

_ So there is a leadership void. Hence the troika cap-

‘ainship which will clutter the center circle and outnum-
ber the referees. But the idea of tri-captains is sound be-
cause it gives any of these three, Rod Knowles, Tom
Youngdale or Dave Moser, the chance to move up from
this position to the real job of leading the team.
__ The history of Davidson basketball has included year
in and year out the presence of a sparkplug who could
get the points in the clutch and draw superhuman efforts
from his mates when it counted. That is what this year’s
team will have to have if we are to remain strong against
the rigors of a tough schedule. (At least we'll get outside
the county a couple of times this year.)

_ Knowles came through in the clutch last year, aver-
aging over 30 points a game in the NCAA playoffs. Quot-
ing Lefty in the Southern Conference propaganda: “He
should be one of the best big men in the country.” He
could be the leader if he wants to be. The best-known of
the cagers, he is the most experienced and will have to
carry the load that Dick Snyder pulled last year.

Moser is a rarity in Wildcat basketball circles be-
cause he will be the first pointman to shoot enough to
be considered an offensive threat since Driesell arrived.
Whether he becomes the leader depends on whether the
others fail to come through. The Driesell system gives
the ball to the pivotmen for the easy shot and hence,
Moser will have to take the shots because they won't
come to him.

The player who may become the Dick Snyder this
year is Wayne Huckel. Because of his manner of play, he
will foul, but he will get. fouled. A Huckel in there could
be the spark to ignite the big men out of their compla-
cency. A Huckel on the bench will help little.

The Varsity needs a leader, If that person identifies
himself early in the season, the Davidson tradition will
continue. If he doesn’t, the five players out there will
still win games, but not the big ones. Someone needs only
to take the initiative. And take it soon.

Get out from under this weekend. Fly some-
place—for half tare on Eastern.
Visit a friend in another town. See an

“away” game. Change the scene. Leave late,
come back late, enjoy a long weekend—
without cutting classes.

Use your Eastern Youth ID Card, or an-
other airline's version. If you don’t have one
—and you're under 22—you really ought to.

To get your Youth Fare Card, send a $3
check or money order, proof of age (copy

With your Youth ID Card, you can get
an Eastern ticket for half fare. No advance
reservations are permitted. But if there’s a
seat free at departure time, after passen-
gers holding reservations and military per-
sonnel have been seated, you can fly to
any Eastern city in the United States, And
