Meavy Petting

Freshmen have their first-time hands-on
experience with exotic animals

Deep in the heart of the
Rowan County Soil and

Water Conservation District .

lies a tiny slice of wilder-
ness, Mooresville style. The
Lazy 5 Ranch is a petting-
zoo experience for every-
one, from little girls (actual
visitor quote: “Oh Daddy,
how I would like to take a
one of the baby goats
home!”) to Davidson college
students.

One sunny Saturday af-
ternoon, four such adven-
turesome students pulled
into the Lazy 5 parking lot
(see safety tip no. 1), mo-
seyed up to the Trading Post
and traded $7.50 each for a
nail-biting journey through
a maze of large flightless
birds, pregnant swine, and
ungulates of all sizes.

Before entering the
motorcar portion of the
ranch, we visited the caged
animals near the trading post,
which featured a very lethar-
gic camel and several exotic
birds. Several llamas were
also there, but these “peris-
sodactyls of the evening”
will only be petted while you
feed them.

Then, we decided chal-

lenge the turkeys that stand
guard at the entrance of the
gravel road into the wilder-
ness. After some coaxing,
they let us pass, and we drove
into the jaws of the forest.
We soon discovered that the
ranch is under the collective
thumb of the ostrich mafia.
Only the truly foolhardy dare
question their authority.
Often during ourjourney our
progress was regulated by
gangs of ostriches pecking
at our windows and standing
in front of our car.

The emus are smaller,
but no less belligerent than
their ostrich cousins. Both
species eat feed out of the
bucket with violent, thrust-
ing pecks; however, the
emus feed more efficiently
than their relatives. The os-
triches, much like Cookie
Monster, shovel great quan-
tities of food toward their
maws only to have it invari-
ably fall to the ground.

Several herds of deer-
like animals also populate
the park. Many of them,
including the elk, were the
most docile of the beasts we
tried to feed. But beware of
the small Oriental deer:
though cute, they will mo-
lest the hand that feeds them.
Perhaps the most ubiquitous

- of the Lazy 5’s inhabitants

are the diminutive pigs that

scurry across the grassy
plains. The preponderance
of pigs probably stems from
the fact that every sow we
saw was very, very gravid.

Perhaps because they
had the coolest names, the
yak, water buffalo and bison
would not lower themselves
by acknowledging our pres-
ence, even when we threw
food at them.

As we left the ranch,
followed by an adoring
group of burros, we decided
that despite the steep price,
the Lazy Sranch would prove
an amusing diversion for any
college student with the right
mindset and an affinity for
large hoofed mammals.

Important Safety Tips for
Visiting the Lazy 5:

1. When attempting to park,
do not hit the pigs in the
parking lot.

2. Do not eat=the-animal-

feed. Will was not impressed
with the flavor.

3. Do not pet the horned
animals.

4. Obey the official park
rule against feeding children
to the animals.

5. Hold on to your bucket 0’
feed tightly — some of the
critters really get into their
meal.

6. Don’t drink the “Brownie
Chocolate” drink in the

How to get there for
your own adventure:
Take Main Street/
Highway 150 north —
through Mooresville.
Bear left at Highway
152 so as to avoid
colliding with the
Mooresville Collision
Repair Company, Inc.
The ranch is on the left
— just look for the
steer and burros in the
front yard. Call ahead
for wagon ride
appointments.

Hayes Trotter uses the force

By JEFFERY CROMARTIE
Staff Writer

Expression is a compli-
cated process, and many of
us would rather keep our
ideas to ourselves rather than
risk public criticism and pos-
sible humiliation. However,
there are many souls here
who have pulled themselves

together with courage and
drive to become Davidson’s
finest.

With this in mind, I’d
like to announce that the Arts
and Living section will
present biweekly profiles of
student artists in residence.

‘This weekIhad the plea-
sure of spending some time
with Hayes Trotter. Hayes

is a studio art major who is
currently preparing for se-
nior exhibition. Hayes is
known for his warm, caring
personality, and his dyna-
mite sense of humor. One of
Hayes’s most popular works
is a wall-sized fresco of a
dynamic hyperjump scene
from Star Wars.

Hayes, what is art?

to bring hyperspace home

Trotter: I’d say art is a
means of sharing. It is a
vehicle to invite people into
the world of imagination. It
is sort of an instigator. En-
gaging yourself in visual art
allows you to look at things
in a different manner.

How did you become inter-
ested in the world of art?
Trotter: Way back in Kin-
dergarten, I drew this little

piece with Cowboys and In- |

dians. I remember it be-
cause I liked it a lot, and
because I had a lot of fun
doing it, and I received a lot
of feed back from my teach-
ers. Then, stuff just kept
happening and there was a

lot of support for the stuff I

was doing from my parents
and some of my teachers. I
guess they helped direct me

to do something that I really »

enjoy. If you receive sup-
port, then you aremorelikely
to challenge yourself. There
are also people who can step
out and just start making art

Jay Hinton ontheirown and they do just

as good of a job as someone
who has that support.

How can those of us who are
notartists show our support?
Trotter: First of all, I think
everybody is an artist, Ev-
eryone is able to create.
Everyone is able to express.
I think a lot of people are
intimidated by the enormous
amount of visual art out
there. Just being conscience
of what’s out there or going
to museums or just reading
the arts section in the paper
— there is a lot of neat stuff
out there. Or maybe just
taking a class for an hour a
week or something. Become
familiar with art; it’s fun.

Who are some of your favor- :

ite artists?

Trotter: [like this artist called
Red Gooms. He’s my fave.
He does sort of cartoony
stuff, and he uses lots of dif-
ferent sculptures/paintings.
He drew this picture of Gra-
ham Tarkington, a quarter-
back for the Vikings. Any-
body who can make art out

of Graham Tarkington has
got to be pretty sweet.
Hayes, could you tell us a
little bit about your mural?
Trotter: Well, we [Hayes
and his roommates] had the
means to do something, and
thoughtit was a good idea. I
figured this was a good
chance to lay down some
hyperspace. I mean, to be
honest it’s really not that in-
credible of a painting, but I
think that it’s sort of a nov-
elty idea. Just the fact that
it’s large, and if you try real
hard you can almost feel like
you are in the Millennium
Falcon. It’s fun; people come
in and talk about it. Believe
or not people have a lot of
deep feeling for Star Wars,
and I feel the love of Star
Wars is elicited by the paint-
ing. It’s pretty comedy more
than anything. Plus, Ineeded
a‘place for my stand-up
Wookie.
