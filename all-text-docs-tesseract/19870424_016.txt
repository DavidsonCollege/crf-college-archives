jor more focus in their later years. The present system is too
| tigid. Because of the decreased course load and the possi-
| vility of blocked: classes, the exhaustion factor is moot.
| Again, this 3-2-3 course load possibility allows for easy
transfer of semester system credit for students on leave
| from Davidson. Furthermore, with the “two course term”
| chere is a greater adaptability for terms studied abroad. The
| oenefits of independent study and the restructured core cur-
| iculum are retained in this modified term system. Finally,
| motivated students could take the ninth course for either
| broadening his or her horizons, or to make up for lost cred-
it.

"| After examining the facts, not to mention all of the

| hypothetical and situational by-products, one finds no sub-

| stantial reason for acceptance of the Educational Policy

4 4 jCommittee’ s proposed semester package. Ultimately, the

| | benefits. of semesters are in the interests of the faculty and
Jadministration, with professors teaching one less course

and fewer registration and exam periods. The other sup-
posed benefits of semesters are negligible in light of a mod-
ified term system. The issue of semesters versus terms
should not be clouded with curricular and/or calendar con-
cerns. These issues are distinct and separate from each
other. What needs to be decided is whether we as students
will allow the proponents of the semester package to skirt
student opinion and welfare, and ignore the reasoning of
faculty who disagree. The decision process has been taking
place over the last year and, though all are not in agreement
_with this statement, the process has not been on the table of
the college community as a whole. Though a curricular
change and the benefits to be reaped thereof are welcome,
there is no logical connection to the term/semester issue.
Do not allow this “package” to slide into acceptance be-
cause of curricular advantages, and in doing so do away
with the advantages of the term system.
