Plans Made
For Socials

Class Of 1939 Expects To
Entertain Faculty Members
In Spring

they

For the purpose of promot-
ing a general better feeling be-
tween seniors and faculty, the
class of ’39, at a business smok-
er Thursday evening, Decem-
ber 8, unanimously decided to
hold a faculty-senior day next
spring.

Definite plans will be made in
February when the faculty mem-
bers will be invited to join in a
stag-smoker with the seniors to ar-
range details for this day. Class
president Sam Newell has announc-
ed that the celebration next spring
probably will include an athletic
competition in the afternoon be-
tween seniors and professors and
a barbecue supper or some other
type of feed at night.

President Newell appointed as a
committee to make plans for this
event, Ovid Bell, chairman, Shaw
Smith, and Oscar Armstrong. Three
other new committees were an-
nounced at the meeting. Dan Walk-
er is chairman of a smoker com-
mittee. He, with Walt Heilman and
Wilson Northcross, will arrange for
the refreshments and entertainment
at senior meetings. Charlie Roberts,
chairman, and Jack Tillotson will
take charge of the invitations for
graduation. Gene Liipfert has been
appointed to draw up any resolu-
tions which will be discussed dur-
ing the year at class meetings.

The seniors unanimously adopted
a proposed class budget presented
by treasurer Addison Long. Class
dues will be collected through the
office of the college treasurer along
with the regular college fees. They
also adopted a resolution thanking
the administration and alumni asso-
ciation for the blanket invitation to
attend the alumni luncheon Home-
coming day.

At the completion of class busi-
ness the seniors were entertained
with music by the new Carnegie
record set. f
