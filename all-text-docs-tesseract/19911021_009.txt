Public Enemy Refuses to Mellow With Age:

Apocalypse ‘91.

By Jay Ferguson

Let me begin by saying that I
am nota music critic. What I am is
a hard-core fan of rap, and more
specifically, a long-time
Public Enemy fan. I have
watched them progress from
an entertaining but.run-of-
the-mill b-boy crew on their
first album, Yo! Bum Rush
the Show to a sophisticated,
community-minded, politi-
cally aware group that rep-
resents the sentiments of a
large segment of black
American society on their
latest release.

Those of you who are
looking for an objective
critique of a controversial
group may wantto stopread-
ing here.

I realize that by saying
this I am showing support
for the same group that almost
disintegrated in 1989 in the face of
charges of anti-Semitism. Itis also
the same group that has been ac-
cused of fostering race-hate in
blacks against whites. On top of
all that, there have'been accusa-
tions from both inside and outside
the black community that Public
Enemy (henceforth to be referred

to as “P.E.”) glorifies and pro-
motes violent tendencies in its lis-
teners The fact that they take their
name from a well-known 1931

kangster movie doesn’t necessar-
ily help to assuage these feelings.

Nevertheless, I think that P.E.’s
message, though sometimes scath-
ing and even excessive, contains
many of the unspoken feelings of
black people nationwide. After
all, let’s face the uncomfortable
facts -- being black in Americacan
often result in feelings of anger,

frustration, and resentment, even
in 1991 (I’m speaking from per-
sonal experience here, know what
I mean?). What P.E. says is what
many blacks secretly feel,
but are too polite or too
afraid to verbalize.

Iknow, I’msup-
posed to be reviewing
P.E.’s new album, Apoca-
lypse ’91...The Enemy
Strikes Black. 1 apologize
for the sociopolitical tirade
in the first few paragraphs,
but I guess I had to get that
stuff off of my chest.
Anyway;n to the album.

For those of you
who thought maybe this
group would mellow with
age, I hate to be the one to
break it to you, but you
were wrong. Chuck (the
m.c., i.e, lead singer), Flav
(Chuck’s sidekick, providing
comic relief),and the S1’s (amock
paramilitary group of fellas who
are part of the crew) come off as
hard as ever.

Once again we hear the boom-
ing voice of Chuck D backed by
cacophonous musical tracks as he

Bryan Bales On Painting

Davidson Arts presents the sec-
ond essay ina series of articles ex-
amining artists at Davidson. How

and why do artists work? We have -

asked several artists to comment
upon the technical aspects of their
work as well as their personal mo-
tivations. Last week's issue of-
feredTed Richardson’ s insight into
photography. This week senior
Art History major Bryan Bayles
discusses painting.

It is a joy to be the servant of
the work. And it is a humbling
and exciting thing to know that
my work knows more than I do.

-Madeleine L’Engle

For me, art-making is a com-
pulsion. I choose to want to create
no more than I choose to want to

sleep. The only conscious deci-

- sion I have control over is whether

or not I will heed the. urge and
struggle to give it form--make it
visibly real. And for reasons I
hope are motivated by love, I do.

Whether through the act of
painting, teaching, performing
surgery, sweeping a building, etc.,
we are all given the opportunity to
use process as a means of explor-
ing our world with a critical mind
and consequently resolving the
many biological, spiritual, and
cultural conflicts and anxieties that

‘are a very real part of life.

Todo sorequires one essential
element: faith. Faith that the criti-
cal evaluation and exploration of
emotional, socio-political, and
visual constructs will lead to the

discovery of some sort of Truth. I
try each day to build my life around
this faith. I believe that when lam
creating art, I am in a sort of dia-
logue with Truth, small glimpses
of which have been revealed to me
in sparks of insight, smiles of the
elderly, and rare bows of humility.
Itisonly when] give myself wholly
-- become a vessel -- for this Truth
that something universal, a true
resolution, can be created.

Of course, such selflessness is
never the case, and what-results is
a fascinating and endless store of
imagery somewhere between me
and Truth. And occassionally,
when I am lucky, Truth’s visual
form -- Beauty -- deigns to poke its
head out from beneath my-forms.

Use Your Illusion I & Il:
Guns 'N' Roses Stay on Top

By Chip Petree

Guns’ N’ Roses. The words
instantly conjure up images of long-
haired, leather-wrapped, « foul-
mouthed hooligans lighting up the
stage or your dorm’s lounge TV

iors). Well, these guys are that bal
and more. The Gunners are

rock music scene (although Metal-

resultof the huge success of 1987’s
debut LP, Appetite for Destruc-
tion, and 1988’s “effort”, Lies.
Since then, the group has seen
lead howler W. Axl Rose go into
rehab, guitarist Slash and bassist
