The 1976 varsity men’s
tennis team returns five of the
top six singles players from
last year’s team.

for a touchdown.

‘On the goal: Cat halfback John
Morrissey crosses the goal line.

However, it is possible that
some of these players might be
displaced from the top six.
Coach Jeff Frank stressed that
possibility, saying, ‘‘As far as

I’m concerned, it’s a wide-

open team next spring, largely
based on what we’ll see this
fall.’’

Amass 914 total yards

Bears thrash Cat gridders,

By PAUL BANTA
Staff Writer
The Lenoir Rhyne fontball
squad rolled up 914 yards
offensively Saturday to
soundly defeat the Davidson

Wildcats 69-14.

The Lenoir Rhyne offense,
gaining 837 yards on the
ground and 77 yards passing,
accumulated a total offense
figure surpassing the present
NCAA University and College
Division records.

*These figures will not be
written in the books, however,
as Lenoir Rhyne is not a
member of the NCAA.

Scott Crawford led the
Bears with 247 yards rushing.
The offense did, however,
commit five turnovers. In
addition, 11 penalties subtrac-
ted 135 yards from the Bear
offense.

Davidson managed its best
offensive showing of the
season with 202 yard rushing
“on 43 carries, and 233 yards
total offense. The 14 points
Davidson scored, also was a
Wildcat seasonal high.

Freshman Terrell Rhye
scored in the first half on a
37-yard run, and another
freshman, John Morrissey,
added the second touchdown
on a 14-yard run in the fourth
quarter. Joe Duncan added
both extra points. .

The Davidson offense pic-
ked up 100 yards rushing from
the fullback position, as
Senior Steve Stec ran for 53
yards on 10 rushes, and Rhyne
added 47 yards on 6 carries.

Davidson Coach Ed Farrell
will make several lineup
changes in an effort to streng-

then the Wildcats this Satur-
day in the homecoming game
against the Citadel.

On offense, freshman Jon
Hartéwill start at left guard.

Defensively , sophomore
John Huie will start at left
tackle, and Chris Crosby,
another freshman, will be on

the first team at the right end.

‘Some of these changes are
because of injuries and some
others are as a result of
players who did not play
well,”’ Farrell said.

‘We have some players who

are capable, but did not play .

well last week, and there are

some who have progressed to —

the point that they should see
more action.’

The Citadel, which lost last
week to East Carolina, 3-0, is
8-2 overall and 1-1 in the
Southern Conference.

“They are tough offensively
and defensively,’’. Farrell
remarked. ‘‘Offensively they

miss Andy Johnson (Johnson
was the nation’s sixth leading
rusher in 1974, and was hurt in
The Citadel’s 16-0 loss to
Colgate), but they’ve still got
some pretty good people.
‘One of the surprising
things about them that they
are very good passing off of
the veer offense. Yeu don’t see

too many teams do that,’ ’ said
Farrell.

and sopho-:

Barnhill, and Stewart Boswell,
played regularly in the top six
last season.

Sophomores Brian Cooper
and Steve Johnson played in
several matches last year,
both in singles and doubles
competition. ‘“‘Both boys are
eapable of earning a position
in the top six,’’ said Frank.

Four freshmen team mem-
bers will be contending for the
same berths. They are Gil
Kayton from Hampton, Va.,
Tom Shelly from Dublin, Ire-
land, John Trout from Fruit-
land Park, Fla., and Andy
White from Birmingham, Ala.

Frank expects to have
“great depth and balance” on
this team.

“On a given day our number
nine or ten man might take a
set off our number one or two
man,” remarked Frank. °

Frank predicted that this

4 situation would provide heal-

thy competition within the
team. He emphasized the im-
portance of each player work-
ing hard in fall practice.
‘‘Every player is going to
have to discipline himself,
work hard and stay in shape in
the first part of the season in
order to end up in the top six.”’
In regard to Davidson’s
hopes in the Southern Confer-

69-14

Defensively, the Citadel,
led by ‘dinebacker Brian Ruff,
has only allowed 32 points in
five games.

The Citadel ranks third
nationally in scoring defense,
behind Arizona and Texas
A&M.

This will be the Citadel’s
first trip to Davidson since
1971. Kickoff is scheduled for
2 P.M. on Richardson Field.

ence, Frank believes that
every team in the conference
will be improved from last
year. Making the competition
tougher for Davidson is the
fact that every Southern
ference team except Davidson
offers tennis scholarships.

In spite of that, said Frank,
Davidson could fare rather
well in the Conference. Accor-
ding to Frank, Furman will be
favored to finish first, with
Appalachian State, William
and Mary, and Davidson
bunched together behind
them.

FRANK.

Richmond and the Citadel
are predicted to finish prob-
ably slightly behind those four
teams.

Frank cited Davidson’s
third-place finish in the Con-
ference last year, the return of
seven lettermen, and the
strong freshman players as
plus marks for the team. He
also noted that Davidson's
tentative schedule, with . 23
home matches,and only three
away matches, could be an
advantage.
