‘Reverend Edgar A. Woods.
Talks at Sunday Service

Davidson Graduate, Now Pastor at
Salisbury, Brings Message to
| Students

An unusually interesting talk was
given by Rev. Edgar A. Woods, '19, at
the regular vesper services last Sunday.
Securing the attention of his hearers
from the very first moment, he asked the
question, “How would you define a man?”
| Then, taking up the natural definitions,
he discussed the strength and weakness
of each.

First he spoke of the theory that man
is a victim: a victim of disease, a victim
}of other men, a victim all his life of an
“unkind world. Briefly this
opinion as that of pessimists, he passed
on to a more logical theory, that man is
a fighter.

He explained that fighter in this defi-
nition does not designate one who can
and will fight on occasion, but one who
fights all the time and glories in it. Go-
ing back to prehistoric days when man
was to the whole world and
spent his whole in fighting, he gave ex-
amples which showed that as the world
progresses man is becoming less and less
a fighter,

dismissing

A noted instance cited by him
was a vote taken through the entire nine
millions of Franee as to who had done
the most for her. The winner was not
Bonaparte, the great fighter, as might
have expected, but Pasteur, the
scientist, who has benefited the entire
world with his noted discoveries for the
| prevention of disease.

The next theory discussed by Rey. Mr.
Woods was that held by many, that man
primarily Tholugh
doubtlessly not intending it, many men
pass their lives as though man’s principle
object on earth is the amassing of great

wealth, Briefly showing the fallacy of

this conception, which is more often fol-

lowed than believed, he passed on to a
‘definition which required much skillful
‘explanation and interpretation before be-

ing rejected as inadequate—that man is

a thinker,

stated that it was the most important
quality of man that he had discussed so
far. “The beneficial result of man’s
thinking is almost infinite,” he said, “but
it is incorrect to attempt completely to
define man as a thinker. Some
adequate definition must. be found.”

more

Mr. Wood then said that the best deti-
nition is that man is a servant. Referring
to the words of Jesus in the thirteenth
chapter of John, he definied the most im-
portant duty of man as helpfulness.
“Man at his best is a servant, and all
mankind should be judged by the service
that they have rendered the world.” Sev-
eral examples of helpfulness and humility
were given, chief of which was the life
of John S. Huyler.

Mr. Woods closed his talk leaving this
grave question ringing in the minds of
his hearers, “What do you propose to
show to the world ten, twenty or thirty
years from now as your conception of a
man?”

Four times the two teams have met before
on the gridiron, the fault of so few clashés
resting entirely with absence-of football in
the Methodists school for a period of around
twenty_years. Back in 1922 the Wildcats
journeyed to Greensboro for the first game,
losing to the Blue Devils 12-0 as Lagerstedt,
one of the greatest stars of the 1924 game,
played brilliantly for the Trinity team.

In 1923 a wabbling Wildeat cleven fell
before the powerful Trinity line on a muddy
field in Charlotte as Shipp, greatest Trinity
back, broke away for long runs; This was
the first of the Thanksgiving Day meetings.

Last year Jim Hendrix lead the Davidson
eleven to a thrilling victory as the Wildcats
staged a fourth-quarter rally to score two
touchdowns. The final was 21-13,
Davidson ending its season with a clear-cut
victory.

The committee made an extensive search
ior the unusual and appropriate consider-
ing several types of blazers, lumber
jackets and other popular sport coats.

After quite a bit of opposition at first,
the class finally adopted the committee's
latest suggestion, blazers. These blazers
will be of dark blue material with a thin
gold band. They are ultra-fashionable in
design and of excellent material. What

is even more desirable, it is ‘not dupli-
cated by any of the various fads now in
vogue on the Hill.
