A Few Statistics

This week rung down the final curtain on sports for the
’Cats for 1938-’39. Looking at the tabulated results of all
contests during the year over a couple of columns, we find
that Davidson has a percentage of .583 for the year. The
frosh track team and the Beester football squad are the only
undefeated teams, with the golf team leading varsity ath-
letes by eight wins against one loss. Tennis follows: closely
with nine for eleven. The quintent had 170 more points than
their opposition to lead that bracket, and the Kit tracksters
scored 219 more points than their opponents to pace the
freshmen, Only one, tie game resulted out of 153 contests
during the two terms, and that was in soccer.

J. D. Hicks, senior outfielder and hurler, led the willow-
wielders on the diamond with 28 safeties out of 64 of-
ficial trips to bat. He led in singles, with 21, and tied
in doubles with Steere, Edmondson, and Hellekson, all
of whom had 6. Steere and Niven led in triples with
three each. There was a great scarcity of these, only 14
being knocked all season. Hand had two homers to lead
the pack. There is no dope on runs batted in, which
are very important to any club.

Tommy “Short-dog”’ Yarborough led thé frosh hitters
with a high 452 mark, Morris being next with 421, and
pitcher Lucas third with .355. Owens, Carter, and Smith all
hit .300 or over for the and should furnish power
for next year.

High Spots And By-Lines

Dave Spencer certainly has proved himself a real athlete
by winning four numerals this year. Playing in a majority
of games, he has not made any of them by slipping in at the
last moment of a lost game ... Red Telford joins the ranks
of the great also as he wins a track letter, his third ‘“D”
for the year . . . Hayseed Thomas, a reliable chunker and
.290 hitter, chosen to lead next year’s diamond squad
which loses five veterans, but which will pick up some good
replacements from the frosh ranks .. . Ned Iverson leads the
tracksters in points for the season with Walker and Sample
tied for the second slot . The Phi Gams took away the
softball championship for their third gtraight year and placed
three men on the all-frat team .. . Editor Casali continue to
make the all-intramural teams of his own paper .

Winding Up

As we wind up the school year we cannot but hope
that the powers that be will feed Felix plenty of spinach
this summer so we can have lots of “Davidson Trounces—”
headlines next year. We also hope there are lots of good
halfbacks, basketball artists, pitchers, hitters, trackmen,
and what not in that new assortment of goods due to ar-
rice here next September. And whether or not they bring
the athletes, let’s hope they bring some more of. that
“Wildcat Spirit.” Vacation, you call us!

innings. The preceding Thursday,

Presbyterian Junior College by the

score of 8 to 0 for their fourth
straght victory.
Feature of the Legion Junior

to the plate. He allowed only three

hits while striking out six, two
of these by Riddle, Junior left
fielder,

The Kittens got off to a fast start,
securing 5 runs in the first inning,

In the P. J. © game on Thurs-
day the Freshmen were held to
six hits, but were able to convert

in the fourth frame on four hits
coupled with one Scottie error.

Ed Lucas again pitched master-
ful ball in allowing his opponents
only five hits while striking out
five. No Kitten was able to garner
over one hit, as the P. J. C. hurlers
limited them to six hits.

Going through the season with a
