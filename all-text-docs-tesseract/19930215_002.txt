Speaks on
Buddhism
& Its Role

Guruge

Continued from page 1

gence and mortification. He
preached that life is impermanent,
permeated with suffering, and un-
controllable due to the unpredict-
able nature of things.

Dr. Guruge explained the
training of the mind or “mind cul-
ture” as the crux of Buddhistteach-
ing. A follower of Buddha should
exercise spirityal involvement:
value, morality, Sila. Buddhism
promotes behavior guided by such
principles askindness, compassion,
sympathetic joy, and the sense of
equanimity.

According to Dr. Guruge, Sri
Lanka is tolerant to all religions
and philosophies serving asa model

. for other nations to emulate. “This

is anation that cares for the rebels
during its civil war by keeping
them fed and tending to their
wounded,” Dr. Guruge responded
to a question from the audience.

The lecture was sponsored by
the Culpepper Foundation, AT&T,
Nationsbank, Southern Bell, Union
Board Committees, the South Asia
Department, the economics depart-:
ment, and the SGA as a part of
South Asia week.

As part of an informative se-
ries celebrating February as Black
History Month, afilm entitled “The

‘Road To Brown” was shown in the

College Union last Thursday
evening. The film was introduced
by History Professor, Dr. Barbara
Ballard. “The Road to Brown”
documented the achievements of
black lawyer and crusader for
equality Charles Hamilton Hous-
ton. Houston’ s life of dedication to
his cause culminated in the 1954
U.S. Supreme Court decision pro-
claiming segregation unconstitu-
tional in the landmark case Brown
v. the Board of Education.

In 1896 the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled “‘separate but equal”
facilities constitutional in the
Plessy v. Ferguson case. Thus
began the era of Jim Crow laws at
the turn of the century. However,
the rights of African-Americans
were largely ignored. Houston, a
graduate of Amherst, College and
son of affluent parents, was not
originally interested in a life of
activism. After volunteering for
duty in World War I and experi-
encing conditions suchas sub-stan-
dard housing and white lynch
mobs, Houston changed his mind.

Charles Houston became the
first black member of the Harvard
Law Review and was named Dean
of Howard University Law School
in 1929. He claimed that a aye

was either “‘a social engineer or a
parasite on society," and Houston
strove to be the former. He became
aspecial counselor forthe NAACP
in 1934. Houston’s ambition was
to attack the “separate but equal”
clause by concentrating on segre-
gation in education.

A black man denied admis-
sion tothe only law school in Mary-
land on the basis of his color was
the subject of Houston’s first noted
victory. From there he moved to
equalizing the salaries of teachers
in Maryland and eventually saw
the doubling of these African-
American teachers’ wages. Later,
Houston won a case in the Su-
preme Court which involved a
student’s rejection to law school
on the basis of his color. This
pushed him onto thenational stage.

In 1940 Houston left the
NAACP and Thurgood Marshall
was named his successor. Hous-
ton widened his areas of concen-
tration, leading demonstrations and
serving on Roosevelt’s Fair Prac-
tices. Committee. Houston once
stated that he “would give his life
fighting day and night,” and this is
just what he did. So dedicated to
fighting for justice, Houston did
notheed his doctors’ warnings and
died of heart failure in 1950. Hous-
ton got his wish, though, for he
said he “would rather die on his
feet than live on his knees."

Study Abroad Applications Near Deadline

By Shaye Benton

For the adventurous and the
prudent.... for «the laid-back and
the high-strung.... wonderful op-
portunities exist here at Davidson
for students to experience cultures
and study at international universi-
ties in almost any country world-
wide. The Office of Study Abroad
hasa library of information for any
curious individual; for those who
are considering to study interna-
tionally, now is the time to stop by
the office, ask questions, and fill
out applications.

Davidson students in the past
have studied in countries from
Western Europe to Asia and have
returned to Davidson with great
experiences, new knowledge, and
good advice. Students serve as
valuable resources; they have re-
cently traveled, gone through the
application processes, and made
the decisions.

When asked to describe
memorable aspects of their trav-
els, students respond with enthusi-
asm. While participating in
Davidson’s Montpelier program
Julia Lake enjoyed her literature

courses. She noted that the loca-
tion of Montpelier, ten minutes
from the Mediterranean, provides
a bright and sunny climate and
gorgeous vineyards.

During his semester in Kenya,
Dan Bahmiller took three safaris
of ten days each traveling across
Kenya to national and differ-
ent areas to study/wildlife and na-
tive cultures.

Mary Katherine Gregory

spent a semester in Edinburgh,
Scotland with the Davidson Pro-
gram and remembers both the city
of Edinburgh and the Scottish coun-
tryside as absolutely beautiful. She
noted that the friendliness of the
Scots made her feel at home as

~ well.

Mike Grant remarked that
during his stay in Brisbane, Aus-
tralia he felt comfortable because
English is spoken there. He re-
marked that it is worth visiting
Australia national parks to see the
koalas and kangaroos.

Peter Hurtado studied in
Hungary and recommends his ex-
perience in a homestay with a na-
tive family in order to “see the
culture from the inside.” He noted
that studying in an Eastern Euro-
pean country is especially interest-
ing because of the social and eco-
nomic changes currently taking
place.

Amanda Grim noted the
well-organized public transporta-
tion system of the Netherlands and
the popular concern individuals
have for the environment. She said
that in order to decrease the use of
cars “everyone rides bikes.... if
someone comes by to give you a
ride, you will ride on the back o

their bike or on the handlebars.”

Dr. Homer Sutton is the
present Coordinator of Davidson’s
Study Abroad Program and Ms.
Carolyn Ortmayer is Associate
Coordinator. The office hours are
from 9:30 - 3:00, M-Fand students
are encouraged to stop by the of-
fice, located on the second floor of

Chambers, anytime.

Financial aid for study abroad
is offered through the Financial
Aid Office and a foreign study
scholarship fund is also available
for interested students through the
Dean Rusk Office. Currently, ap-
plications are available for the
Oeland Scholarship for Summer
Language Study, and are due by
Friday., April 2.

Davidson’s study abroad office

introduces students to once-in-a- -

lifetime adventures. If you are
interested in sampling thought and
culture from around the world,
study abroad is for you.

Davidson students experience a taste of India last semester.
