THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONK’S BASKETEERS GET FIRST WIN

CAT TRAX
As They Follow the Red and
Black
By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Well, judging by the way the
Wildcats tamed the Wofford Ter-
riers Mohday night, they are ready
to put on full steam. Every man
on the team was shooting like a
demon. Frontis Johnson proved
that he has arrived—he couldn’t
miss. Jimmy Moore came through
with some nice baskets. Of course
Pritchett and Calhoun were in
there all the time, and Bill Good-
son’s floor game was a beauty.
Just Wait till after exams and then
watch those old Cats go.

The Wildcats game against Carolina
was a great one, and they came so close
to winning that clash that it was hard to
swallow the defeat. A few more crip
shots and there would have been a dif-
ferent story. There were five fighting
Cats out on the court and they meant
Something’s got to be done
about the way these boys break for the
ball around the basket. It will mean
more points when they learn to break at
the right time.

The Tar Heels showed a pretty
good passing game but their shoot-
ing was nothing to brag about.

they will be a lot better as the
season goes on. This big guard

Monk has a mighty good potential team.
If the boys get to passing that ball and
working together better there will
plenty of trouble radiating out from the
old Wildcat lair. Everybody except Cal-
houn and Crawford is due to return next
year, and that being the case, Davidson
should have a peach of a quint in 1930.

much like it against these Juni
College Teams. «Wingate came up
and handed them a close licking—
33 to 31—but it was.a licking just
the same. We hope the Kittens
tear things up on their trip through
the Old Dominion. They meet the
freshman teams of the same |
schools which the varsity meets.

There is talk going around of a “Tin-
can” for Davidson. Something on the
order of Carolina’s now famous “Can.”
There is a big need for the structure
here, and we hope that by another season
the Wildcats“will be playing in it. Not
only basketball, but mass calesthentics can
be handled in the proposed building. The
erection of the “Can” would certainly he
in keeping with Davidson's constructive
program.

Wildcat Wrestlers
Rounding Into Form

Veteran Team to Take Mat for
Davidson

The Wildcat wrestlers are practicing
daily and they are fast rounding into mid-
season form under the watchful eye of
Coach Buck Miles, former V. P. I. mat
star. This year Davidson has many vet-
erans from last year’s squad and several
former freshman grapplers who are mak-
ing a strong bid for the varsity. Last
year the Wilcats were the runners-up for
the state championship. The matmen
were victorious over N. C. State, Univer-
sity of North Carolina, Concord Y. M
C. A., and Washington and Lee, losing
to Duke and V. M. I.

The following men are showing up
well and are making strong bids for their
respective positions: One hundred and
eighteen pond class, Preston, Cowan;
one hundred and twenty-eight pound class,
Flythe; one hundred and_ thirty-eight
pound class. Brown, Estridge and King;
one hundred and forty-eight pound class,
Herriott and Johnson; one hundred and
fifty-eight» Brock, Brohard and Christen-
bury; light heavyweight, Captain Hill and
“Hub” Covington; heavy-weight, War-
ren and Boyle.

Manager Brohard, who also wrestles
in the one hundred and fifty-eight pound
class, announced the schedule, as follow-
ing! February ninth, V. M. I. at Lex-
ington, Va.; February twelfth, Carolina
at Chapel Hill; February nineteenth,
North Carolina State; February twen-
tieth, Duke University; March second,
Washington and Lee (Pending).

Dargan Plays Beautiful Game
for Losers—Last Contest for
Cats Before Exams

As if in vengeance for the defeat ad-
ministered on the grid this fall, the. David-
son Wildcats took the Wofford Terriors
into Camp on Monday night in the local
gymn, 40 to 30. This was the Red and
Black's first triumph of the season on the
hardwood floor, The Wildcat’s were work-
ing together in great shape, and their de-
fense was superb. The game was marked
by the brilliant defensive work of both
teams against their opponent’s passing
attack. Davidson got the best of the
shooting game, but the passing was about
equally divided.

Capt. Pritchett of the Wildcats led his
team in great style and his floor-work
was a feature of the contest. Johnson

of the locals captured the high-point
honors of the evening with 22 points.
The. defensive work of Shepherd and

Goodson was an asset to the Wildcats in
victory. Calhoun’s work was of great
aid in the contest. Rusk, Moore, Craw-

| ford, and Proctor also saw service and

turned in a good game.

The Davidson team was handicapped by
lack of seasoned men at the opening of
the season, but they are “getting their
sea-legs” now, and should make a big
noise in the cage circles of Tarheelia.

Spring Football to
Start After Exams

Two Months of Stiff Training
Ahead for Aspirants

Spring football training will start on
Monday, January 28th, immediately fol-
lowing the regular mid-semester examina-
tion week. Those who expect to go out
during this early training period will give
their names to coaches Younger and Til-
between January 21st and 23rd, together
with their preference as to position to
be played. Coach Younger states that
he will begin the issuing of uniforms on
the 24th to those qualifying for the prac-
tice. This distribution will continue for
three days, ending on Saturday the 26th.
Training this year will consist of two
months intensive practice in all depart-
ments of the game, and after the first pre-
liminary workouts have been conducted
and the players are fairly well limbered
up, beginning the second month, games
will be played regularly every Saturday
afternoon. This announcement, given out
by Coach Younger, should prove to be of
great interest to a large part of the stud-
ent body, since many are expected to
turn out for this training. In addition to
all old members of the squad, a number
of Freshmen will turn out, swelling the
probable total number to around seventy-

five.

DAVIDSON FIGHTS

Brown, Tar Heel Guard, Rings
up Long Shots to Spoil Wild-
cat Chances—Davidson

Leads at Half

The University of North Carolina Tar
Heels pulled a late rally to down Monk
Younger’s quintet in the game played
Saturday night in Charlotte. The Wild-
cats outplayed their opponents in the early
stages of the conflict and ended the half
on the long end of a 12 to 8 count. Un-
able to penetrate the stiff defense of the
Davidson lads, Carolina resorted to long
shots, and in the closing minutes of play
drew away to a safe lead. Brown, a big
guard, was the boy who started the Heels
on their way to victory, his sensational
goals from mid-court breaking a 16-16
deadlock.

Doped to lose by a large score, the
Wildcats put up a valiant battle against
the four-times Southern Champions, and
threatened to the very last. Johnson
dropped in several beautiful long shots
for a total of six points. Captain Pritchett,
however, nosing him out for high scorer
by virtue of five foul goals and one field
basket. Cathey, center for the Tar Heels
lead the field in total points.

The Wildcats got together and present-
ed a well-night impregnable defense to
the Tar Heels in their efforts to dribble or
pass close to the basket. It was long
shots that pulled the game out of the fire
and gave Jim Ashmore’s men the palm.
Davidson had many chances to score on
crip shots, but invariably the Cats failed
to make them count.

Some five hundred fans packed the Cen-

Wildcats go down to a hard defeat. The

game was thrilling throughout.

“Collegiate” Survey
Conducted by Doyle

Davidson College has been invited to
participate in a nation-wide survey of edu-
cational institutions, undertaken to
certain the real status of the so-called
“collegiate” in American college life.

Henry Grattan Doyle, Dean of Men
of George Washington University, Wash-
ington, D. C., has addressed a question-
aire to the Dean asking a number of gign-
ificant questions pertaining to the “colleg-
iate.” He wants to know whether the
’ is the typical college student ;
also whether slouchy dress or neatness
in appearance is typical of the student
body. He further asks whether student
opinion favors neat dress and courteous
manners or approves slouchy appearance
and careless habits of dress and conduct.
Other queries calculated to classify the
“collegiate” are also made.

as-

“collegeiate’

A similar questionnaire has been sent
to the Deans of four hundred leading col-
leges. When replies are received Dean
Doyle believes he will have a survey which
will be of wide informative value, which
may be presented to the annual conven-
tion of the Association of Deans and Ad-
visors of Men in Washington, April 11,

“Tam sure that in common with me,
have felt and sometimes
chagrin over the mental picture of the
‘collegiate’ boy or girl which the general
public has apparently created during re-
cent years,” says Dean Doyle, in his let-
ter of inquiry. “T feel that this imaginary
individual is by no means typical. For
the purpose of contributing something to-

I am sending this letter to deans in a
number of the leading colleges and wni-
versities throughout the country in order
to get a consensus of fact and opinion
which can be’ presented to the public.”

Dean Doyle then propounds the fol-
lowing question :
1. (a) Is the “‘collegiate” of the

humorous press and the vaudeville stage
the typical student of your college? or
(b) Is he an exception in the person-
nel of your enrollment, and if so, what
percentage of the total student body is
like him?

2. (a) Is a slouchy appearance, asevi-
denced by garterless socks, rumpled shirt
and collar, sloppy shoes and wrinkled suits
of clothing, typical of your student body ?
or

(b)
denced by clean shaving, well-shined shoes,
starched linen, appropriate neckties
neat appearance and well-pressed suits of
clothing, typical of your student body ?

3. (a) In the main, does the psychol-
ogical attitudeof your student body ap-
prove slouchy and careless habits of dress
and conduct or neat habits of dress and
courteous manners ?

(b) Is there any appreciable attitude
of disfavor in your student body toward
carelessness in dress and manners?

4+. Is there in
opinion, between the attempt to be “col-
legiate’” and such problems as:

Is neatness in appearance, as evi-

of

any connection, your

(a) Drinking?
(b) “Necking ?”
(c). Neglect of class work ?
(d) . Dishonesty in examinations ?
(ce) Other ethical problems?
5. Does the “collegiate” type — of

student referred to in the opening of this
letter excel, as a rule, in:

(a) Scholastic standing ?
(b) Sports?
(c) Other student activities ?

6. In your opinion is the “collegiate”
type diminshing or increasing ?

7. Do you or do you not agree with
me that in general our student bodies are
composed of reasonably serious young
people, whose ideals and standards of con-
duet favorably with those of
preceding generations—in short, that their
faults are foults of manners rather than
morals ?

Davidson Wildcats
Downed by Furman

ee
Initial Clash of Season Finds
Locals in Ragged Form

In the first game of the season, played
last Wednesday night the Wildcat bas-
keteers lost to Furman by a score of 55
to 40. It was a very ragged game and
was marred by fouls and the bad pass-
ing of both teams.

Davidson jumped into an early lead
and ran up 16 points in rapid fire order,
holding Furman to 3. It looked as if
it might be a run-away for the Wildcats.
Furman, however, snapped out of it and
quickly jumped into the lead which they
never relinquished thereafter. They were
leading at the half 24 to 22, Furman
kept up her scoring in the second half and
ran up 55 points,

Watson, center the Furman
team, was high point man of the game,
scoring 24 points. Capt. Pritchett of the
Wildeats was second with 16 points. His
footwork and general playing was pretty
