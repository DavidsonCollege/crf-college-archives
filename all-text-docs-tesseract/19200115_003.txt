Rev. R. D. Daffin Addresses
Students at “Y” Service

Many New Facts Concerning Bra-
Fn 7il Brought Out

The first meeting of the Y. M.C. A.
in 1920 was held last Sunday night
in Shearer Hall. There was a large
percentage of the student body out,
and Mr. Miles made a short talk on
the aims of the “Y” for the spring
term. The address of the evening
was made by Rev. R. D. Daffin, who
has been a missionary to Brazil for
fourteen years.

The attention of the audience was
held steadily from the time Mr.
Daffin began his talk till another en-
gagement forced him to close before
he had well entered upon it. Man
of the students had an entitely dif-
ferent conception of Brazil when the
talk was over; all had a more friend-
ly and sympathetic felling for her
peoples. The government of Brazil
is modeled after that of the United
States. The Brazilians are ardent
admirers of their Northern sister,
and always treat her citizens’ with
respect. Probably the highest
tribute ever paid the United States
by another government was the
declaration of war against Germany
promulgated by the Brazilian presi-
dent, who stated that “The Brazil-
ian government declares war be-
cause it always follows the lead of
the United States in international
affairs.” The Brazilians themselves
are a likable people, and although
not the equal of the Anglo-Saxon
race, are of a high order of intel-
ligence. The curse of the country is
its ignorance, and unless its people
can be educated the nation may be-
come a second Mexico. As longeas
the papacy holds sway over the
common people ignorance is bound
But let Protestantism,
with its freedom and liberty loving
principles, awake the Brazilians
from their stupor and supersti-
tions, and within the present life-
time Brazil will be one of the en-
lightened powers of the world.
