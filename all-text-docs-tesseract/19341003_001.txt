As* noted in the Davidsonian

Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford
University must be in the hands
of the state committees by No-
vember 17.

Saturday, November 3, has now been
designated as the date on or before which
application in writing must be made to
the local committee, Professors Vowles,
Lilly and Cumming. While application
to the stite committees must be on the
regulation blank, this blank is not neces-
sary for application to the local committee.
In this case the student should state in
writing that he wishes to be approved
as a candidate for the Rhodes Scholar-
ship in (name of state).

in North Carolina or, if his legal resi-
dence is in another state, in that state.
If, as frequently happens, the applicants
for North Carolina exceed the maximum
quota of five, the committee has the right
to reduce the number, either by elimina-
tion or
this is possible, to other states.

In fact, the committee has received a

take care of with the funds allotted it
by the Federal government, and in
attempt to clarify the tangled application

man of the committee, this week issued
the following statement :

“The committee has received about 125
applications for FERA work, and can
only employ 72 persons in any one month.
That means that most of the applicants
won't be able to receive help throughout
the whole year. We shall try to help only

New Sound System To
Be Used For Duke Tilt

Richardson Stadium is to be
equipped with a new amplifying sys-
ter which will probably be com-
pleted in time for the Duke game.

The new system will allow for
four horns on each of the stadium
amplifiers. This will greatly im-
prove the clarity of the system as
well as increase the volume. A
special feature will be the installa-
tion of a modifier or volume control,
which will select the volume neces-
sary to be audible over the cheer-
ing.

This $125 system, being installed
by the Auten Incorporated of Char-
lotte, is to be another step toward
making Richardson Stadium com-
pletely up-to-date.

Single Cuts Arranged
Day Of Army Game

A number of Davidson men will
take advantage of the single cuts
next Saturday and will attend the
Army game at West Point.

For some time it was rumored that
cuts on the day of the game would
count double, however an agree-
ment has been reached with the
faculty whereby the cuts on the day
of the game at West Point and also
on the Saturday of the Citadel game
will count as single. The cuts on
the preceding Saturdays will be
counted as double according to the
agreement.

In view of the fact that cuts will
be counted on Saturday a number
of trips to ‘the Point’ are being
planned.

its confidence in the Davidson Wildcats

to make a good showing in the conflict
with the State Wolfpack on the follow-
ing evening.

In two well-put stories, Capt. Pritchett
likened the Davidson team to David in
his successful attack Goliath, who
out-weighed him compara-
tive to State's Davidson ;
and he likened the cheering section of
Davidson scheduled to wit-
ness the encounter Saturday to the res-
cuers of Littte Red Riding Hood, who
also had her trouble with wolves,
