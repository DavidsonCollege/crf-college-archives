By BUTCH PHARR

With the close of the Interclass Softball Tournament usually
comes the picking of an All Class Team composed of the most
outstanding players from. the four competing teams. To
avoid sticking his neck out to far, as is ustfally the trouble
with the selection of such teams, your editor has chosen a
team compiled with the aid of the managers of the class teams,
several of the referees, and a few of the sports authorities
among the student body (names withheld for obvious |reasons).

Adolph Larson was a unafimous choice for the short field
position receiving very vote from both managers-and referees.
Ed Murray and Jack Wayman polled the second number of
votes for their positions, with John MacKinnon running third.
The winning Juniors placed four men on the all-star team with
the losing Sophomores placing three. The Seniors, who were
runnerups in the tournament, placed-only-two-men,-while the
~Lreshmen placed one.

Other players deserving honorable mention, but
who did not quite make the team, are Chester Pierce,
catcher;~Davis Thomas, pitcher; Bill Faison and Jim
Jackson, first; Alf Taylor, second; Bill Summers,
third; Rab McGeachy and Joe Barnwell, short; Dick
Miller and Joe Bivens, fielder.

© Star of the week is Trackman Arch Taylor,avho_broke two
school track records in the Carolina A..A..U. Taylor set anew
mark in the 120 yard high hurdles with a time of 14.9, and in
the 220 yard. lows with a time of 224. Pete Whittle, the
present track coach and intramural director, has held the rec-
ords since his hurdling days at Davidson, One man track team
Taylor was the-only Davidson entry at the meet and his two
first in the hurdles and a third in thelOO yard dash gave David-
son a fourth place in the meet. The N, C. State Wolfpack took
first in the meet and will run against the Wildcat speedsters on
Richardson Field next Saturday in what should prove to be the
clostest meet of the s€aSon for the Cats. Andrews of State will
vie with Taylor for individual honors in the conflict Saturday.

He has run up an average of 20 points per meet so far partici-
, pating: in both the dashes aifd-in the field events.

Of another extended trip through the southern
states is the varsity tennis team, having scheduled
matches with North Carolina, Lenoir Rhyne, Tennes-
see, and Centre. Buck Archer, Mac Bruce, Craig
Schmidt, Gene Sutton, and Lyman Parrigan are mak-
ing the trip accompanied by Senior Manager Gus

“» McLean. The team is sporting new jackets for this
occasion and should at least be the best dressed team
if not the winners. Tod Welborn challenged Lyman
Parrigan for his position on the squad last Saturday,
but was finally beaten in the last set. Welborn broke

his racquet, in the middle of the fray after each one .

had taken a set.

Cats meet Center College in Dan-

Sutton and Parrigan made the
trip. The team has shown con-
siderable improvement since the
Florida trip during the holidays.

Much of the improvement has been
due to the activities of their new
coach, Mr. C. W. Gelwick of the
Myers Park Country Club in Char-
lotte. Mr. Gelwick is also coaching
the frosh team.

The Cats have been greatly hand-
icapped by the poor home court
and have had to play all their
matches jin Charlotte. Added to this
many school have had to interrupt

their sports schedules because of
the war and tire situation. As a
result some have canceled their
matches with the Davidson net-
men.
