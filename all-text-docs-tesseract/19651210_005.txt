MOSER USES HIS SCREEN

WAKIES LEARNED TOO WELL

At last the initial shock of this year’s basketball
season -has worn off and Coach Lefty Driesell’s
roundballers have begun to polish up the young,
raw talent that makes up this year’s team.

Wake Forest’s Head Coach Jackie Murdock beat
Driesell at his own game last Wednesday. I won't
recount the parallel of how Driesell broke in five
years ago with a 65-59 upset of the nationally ranked
Deacons; this story has been worn out in the past
two weeks.

But think back three years ago, when Fred
Hetzel and Company inaugurated their varsity
careers with a 76-68 loss to a powerful Duke team.
In less than a month the ’Cats reversed this out-
come and beat Duke in the Coliseum. How?

They did it quite a bit like ‘Murdock beat us.
Duke was relying on a young and inexperienced pair
of guards, Buzzy Harrison and Denny Ferguson, to
get the ball down court. Driesell decided to put a
strong press on these. two Dukes instead of Art
Heyman and Jeff Mullins, conceding them at least
20 points each.

His strategy worked perfectly. Barry Teague
and Don Davidson were able to put pressure on the
Blue Devils’ ball handlers and when they tired or
ran into foul trouble, senior Heywood Evans and
junior Bill Beerman used their experience (both
starters the year before) to keep up the pressure.
Result? Davidson 72, Duke 89. ;

Murdock’s game plan must have paralleled Drie-
sell’s Duke win perfectly. He pressured the Cats in-
experienced ball handler, Phil Squier, with his best,
Bob Leonard, Wake Forest's All-American candidate.
He probably conceded 20 points to both Dick Sny-
Zer and Rod Knowles, and although each bettered
this output considerably, Murdock used his team’s
experience and their unknown quantity Paul Long,
to more than make up for Snyder and Knowles

ievements — one point more.
anit we meet the Wakies again, Jan 29, on
a neutral court in Greensboro. Experience will no
longer be the deciding factor. Squier, who has al-
ready gained twice the poise he showed in the opener
will not be as jittery as the first contest found him.
The sophomores will nearly be battle-scarred vet-
by late January.
re Murdock’s last game plan won't work then. Only
a minor miracle can keep Wake Forest in the game.

But January is a long way off and plenty of

games separate the *Cats from revenge.

St the first 14 games, only two are away from

n thousands apologies to Kit Thompson, the
sophomore football player 1 inadvertently left out of
last week’s column. Thompson started five games
as a tackle this season. Absolutely no malice was
meant toward Thompson, tackles or his fraternity in

leaving him out. : .

meday Furman may come to play Davidson in
basketball and not one word will be wasted about
Frank Selvy and his 100 points against Newberry

piece of “hot news” was Mel Derrick, of the Charlotte
Sse ve seen Furman play Davidson in Davidson for
four straight years and I have yet to hear anyone
whisper ‘‘There’s the C-note man” when Selvy walks
into the gym. Frankly I really don’t think anyone
around here is quite that inane. — except maybe

Derrick.

Last night Wayne Huckle pick-

Rebounding after the
opening-game loss to Wake
Forest, the Wildcat basket-
ballers take on East Caro-
lina and VMI in important
conference clashes tomor-
row and Tuesday nights at
Johnston Gym and Lexing-
ton, Va., respectively.

Having scouted both teams
earlier this season, Assistant
Coach Warren Mitchell was
much impressed with what he
saw in each.

“East Carolina is a much im-
proved team over Jast year.”
Mitchell remarked. “‘They have
more depth, betier rebounding.
and are agressive oh defensc.
The guards this year are also
greatly improved." He empha:
sized also their improved shoot-
ing.

one scorer. A 6-2 sophomore,
Jimmy Cox, is their leading out-
side shooter. Charles Alford, 6-8,
and a trio of 6-6 men — senior
Bob Kinnard and juniors Gerald
Smith and Dan Pasquariello —
provide a great amount of depth
as far as height.

Mitchell predicted also that
ECC would employ a wide as-
sortment of defenses and would
expect to get easy shots off their
full court press.

Turning to VMI, Mitchell
stated that the Keydets have
“perhaps the fastest, quickest
quards in the entire conference
in John Kemper and Robin Port-
er. Both are good drivers, and
Kemper handles the ball excep
tionally well.” He also remarked
that speed was a key factor in
the VMI attack.

conference poll and should lead

The Wildcats’ record against
the two opponents is more than
respectable. With last year's

‘Cats Notch Win

Over Warriors

Davidson’s youthful Wildcats, gaining poise and
confidence with each succeeding game, reeled off
their third consecutive victory last night, defeating
Marquette, 73.65, in the face of numerous handi-
caps.

Specifically, at one point in the first half, three
starters were sitting on the bench, burdened with
personal fouls. But sophomores and reserves deliv-
ered in the clutch to preserve a pressure-packed win
over Al McGuire’s squad.

__ The winning streak was personally launched by
Dick Snyder, who hit a career high mark of 40 points
in the 90-48 conquest of Bucknell. The out-manned
Bisons were constantly plagued by numerous mis-
takes and a tight Wildcat defense. Davidson con-
trolled the boards and then turned the ball over to
Snyder, who treated a near-capacity house to an en-
joyable evening.

The Furman game marked the ’Cats first league
encounter. Sparked by the play of Phil Squier, Dav-
idson rolled to a 90-70 triumph. The senior guard,
displaying a hot shooting hand for the first time,
tallied 17. With him in the line-up, the offense was
noticeably more disciplined. The Paladins constant-
ly threatened to make a close game of it, but every
rally was snuffed-out before any damage could be
inflicted.

The real thriller occurred last night in the Coli-
seum. From the opening tap Marquette applied full-
court harassment in an effort to force turnovers.
However, in the early stages of the game the Wild-
cats beat the press with sharp ballhandling and
shooting.

. Foreéd to watch his tactics backfire, McGuire
spent considerable time on his feet in front of press
row, exhorting his team. On the court, the scram-
ble proceeded at a hectic pace, especially when the
Warriors‘ coach inserted his ‘scrambled eggs” unit.

Nevertheless, the ’Cats forged a 57-39 lead at
one point on the performances of George Leight,
Bobby Lane, and in the second half, Rodney Knowles.

From this point, however, the scrappy Warriors
fought back to a mere six-point deficit. At this time
Marquette resorted to a zone defense to slow the
game down. To counteract this Davidson went to a
stall. controlling the ball in order to notch the vic-
ory.
