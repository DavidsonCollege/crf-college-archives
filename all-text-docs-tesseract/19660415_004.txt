“This is Radio Davidson, 50.-
000 microwatt voice of the Pied-
mont, now resuming broadcast-
ing activities for. the day. Radio
Davidson, AM and FM. comes to
you at unassigned clear channel
frequencies of 875 kilocycles and
93.8 megacycles respectively,
with a power of 30.000 micro-
watts AM and 50,000 microwatts
FM."

Radio Davidson? Everyone
has heard ‘about it unless he
lives more than 100 or so feet
away from the middle of Belk
Dormitory. That's where the
mighty transmitters are located.

number one fan, sophomore

Asked about the broadcasting
range of his tiny transmitter,
Coover bragged, “‘It'l go over

Not content with ordinary
brodcasting. Coover and his co-

have taken to stereo program-

‘running two channels and trans-

mitters. one on FM and one on
AM. We get quite good recep-
tion. It’s planning on using two
FM signals. since AM transmis-
sion is so poor. They will make
it. much better.”

Coover takes credit only for
the mechanical aspect of the
operation. ‘Mason is my an-
nouncer.”” he insists. "I guess
you'd consider me to be just

One might wonder how such
an unregistered transmitter has
avoided the long arm of the

his assurance that there is no
danger, however. ‘‘These are

THE DAVIDSONIAN

The scholarship program for
vocational training among un-
der-privileged families in Char-
lotte was selected to receive the
YMCA Gift Fund this year. The
student body voted Monday aft-
er chapel to donate the annual

| gift to this cause.

During chapel period students
heard proponents of three po-
tential recipients of the money.
Cesar Andrade, Richardson
Scholar from Ecuador, spoke
first for PRAM, which received
the fund last year.

Andrade opened by producing

a shrunken head, straight from
the Amazon jungle. ‘For mil-
lions and millions of people in
the United States this is the
image of the Latin American
people. You may have it your-
self. It mgiht be that you have
the right image. If not, PRAM
will help .you to correct it.
PRAM gives the opportunity for
personal contact between stu-
dents of the Americas.”

The next speaker, Davidson
junior Kent Autrey, was advo-
cate for the Lafayette Avenue

The last speaker was .Walt
MacDonald, a 1964 Davidson

the poor and underprivileged
have in common is their eco-

such as personality and ambi-

whose husband had deserted the
family and given the opportu-

that the economic advantages
of such training are enormous.
The increased spending and tax
