Women
lose
tennis
opener

By ASHLEY MANER

The women’s tennis team
opened its spring season this week-
end by hosting the 6th annual
Doubles Classic at Knobloch Ten-
nis Center.

Saturday, the Wildcats played
a round robin of 8-game pro-sets

against Virginia Tech, Georgia —

Tech and James Madison. Despite
the efforts to senior captains
Kimberley Nance and Nicole
Wilcox, Davidson lost.

The Wildcats had an opportu-
nity to redeem themselves Sunday
against defending Southern Con-
ference champion Furman. In a
close and tense match, the out-
come wasn’t decided until the fi-
nal match when freshmen Creecy
Chandler and Lynne Hall barely
lost 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.

for all sports because of the coordi-
nation it requires and strengthens.
He plans to take teaching certifica-
tion classes this summer and would
love to be a strength coach some-
where.

“I’ve got to coach in some
capacity,” he says.

While he may be reluctant to
consider himself one of the best,
the humble Gabriel certainly is.

“The best take such a heavy
weight and abuse it,” he says.
“They dominate it in every way.
But it doesn’t look strained. They
are calm and focused.”

So late at night, when you
hear that clanging in the weight
room, stay clam, for the person
working inside is very focused.

Women’s hoops struggle through
two more heart-breaking defeats

Following two more losses this
week, the women’s basketball team
is still in search of its first Southern
Conference win.

WOMEN'S
BASKETBALL

Wednesday, they met Furman
at Belk Arena and put up a good
fight, and, for most of the first half,
it looked as though the game would
go down to the final moments.

But the last-minute of the half
seemed to sum up much of
Davidson’s frustration for the sea-
son. i

After tying the score with less

than a minute left before the break,
Furman scored and the Wildcats
were unable to answer.

Then, with ten seconds on the
clock, the Paladins brought the ball
up the floor and scored again as the
buzzer sounded.

The Wildcats came back out
in the second half and tried to get
the momentum back, but the game
slipped away in the last ten min-
utes for the final score of 70-60.

Saturday night, the script was
much the same. Like Wednesday,
the Wildcats came out intense and
looked like they would be able to
give first-place Appalachian State
a run for its money.

But this time, the Wildcats let
the game begin to slip by halftime
when they trailed by ten points.
Davidson couldn’t recover in the

second half and lost 82-68.
Carolyn Kirsch, who has led
the Wildcats all season, had a big
week with two double-doubles.
She pulled downa total of 24 points

and 21 rebounds in the two games, _--

including 10 points and 10 boards

Freshman Danielle Mall
played well off the bench against
Furman with seven points and 11
rebounds. :

Tonya Sharpe was the leading
scorer against the Mountaineers
with 14 points.

The squad finishes out a three-
game home stand Wednesday
against Western Carolina, a team
they played close before and, at
just 1-8 in the conference, could be
the Wildcats best shot at a confer-
ence win.
