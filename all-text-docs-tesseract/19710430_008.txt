rs, upping the number of

nesses for the Davidson
team, but Fagg was pleas-
ed with the material for next
year. Pl

*€ats Remain Favorites InSC

The Davidson tennis team
remains a heavy favorite to
successfully defend its South-
ern Conference title in the
tournament which began yes-
terday at the Davidson
courts, ;

For the.seventh year since
1954 the ‘Cats are hosting
the event. Davidson owns
seven championships, and
four of these have been won
on the home courts.

The Wildcats carry a 17-5
worksheet into the three-day

affair. Other schools com-
peting are Furman (9-10),
William and Mary (8-11),

East Carolina (7-9), The Cit-
adel] (5-9), Richmond (3-11),
and VMI (2-9).

Coach Harry Fogleman,
who is serving “as tourna-
ment manager, acknowledg-
ed that his squad ‘‘should
he considered as the favor-
ites,"

In final tune-ups for the
tournament, the netters
blanked Appalachian 8-0 on
Tuesday and smothered East
Carolina 8-1 on Wednesday.

Furman and The Citadel
are expected to provide «the
biggest threats to dethrone
the ‘Cats.

‘Anyone on their teams
could give us trouble,’’ indi-
cated Fogleman.

He cited Dave Ellison. of
the Paladins as a key player
to watch. Ellison placed sec-
ond in the first court singles
play last year,

Four of the top six Wild-
cat netters garnered titles
last year, but only one play-
‘er will be defending — his
crown, David Weaver cap-
tured the second court sin-
gles championship- a year
ago and will be in that BOR
tion again.
| Each of the first tix ‘Cats
earned top seeding in his re-
-spective court.

Bob Koury is seeking to
become the first number one
singles champion from Da-

vidson. since George’ Berner
in 1968.
Jeff Dumansky fills the

_ third spot for Davidson, and

he took fourth court laurels
last year.
Reigning fifth court winner

Jim Cantrell moves up-
notch to compete for the
number four honors.

for the ‘Cats are Hy Lank-
enau at fifth court and cap-
tain Jeff Chetwood in the

sixth court.

Singles play today begins
at 10 a.m., followed by dou-

Tomorrow the singles fi-
nals begin at 10 a.m. with

very much.”

Skippers Place

Last In SAISA

The Davidson sailing team
was soundly defeated in the
South Atlantf Intercollegi-
ate Sailing Association finals
last weekend at Hartwell
Lake in Clemson, S. C.

The skippers had placed
first once and second twice _
in the three regattas, preced- ©
ing the finals.

A combination “of ‘‘bad
weather conditions, unfamil-
iarity with the ‘‘420's’’ used
in the class A division, and a
mediocre performance,’’ ac-
cording to Commodore Allen
Lundy, netted the ’Cats sev-
enth place in the competi-
tion.

The Wildcats were skip-
pered ‘by Jim Hunter and
Bob Haggard. In the B di-
vision, ‘racing ‘‘Penguins’’
Hunter captured second
place. ; ,

However, the’ A. division
was raced in ‘'420’s,”’ a type
of boat never before used by
Davidson teams, ‘and here
the '@ats finished very poor-
ly.

Tundy, Mark Leonard, Jim
Hunter, and Daryl Douglas
left last night for Boston and
Tufts University for a regat-
ta being held tomorrow and
Sunday.
