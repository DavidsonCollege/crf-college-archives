Beyond Birkenstock: 2
Birkenstock: The New Generation

By Seth McLaughlin

Well, it looks like the world
Beyond Birkenstock now has two
dimensions. Of course, Kyle and I
have always been aware of this bi-
dimensia, but now you, the read-
ing public (all five of you), can see
it for yourselves.

I think Bill Burroughs said it
best; “some of us are on Different
Kicks and that‘s a thing out in the
open the way I like to see what I eat
and visa versa mutatis mutandis as
the case may be.“

It looks like you guys can see
what you eat now as well (the
proverbial Naked Lunch). You will
soon realize that it‘s been Kyle
making you sick all of this time.

You should have seen some of

the things that he wanted to write °

last year; nauscalting.
Now, Kyle is free from my

influence and I‘m afraid he may
not pause from hitting the “Insult‘
key (he chose this option in lieu of
a “Tab‘) on his Macintosh until
each and every one of you lay in
tears athis feet clutching your drip-
ping copy of The Davidsonian.

Of course, I have a Patriot to
these scurrilous SCUDS of his;
editorial control. Itturns out that J.
Kyle has to FAX his little sheets of
terror to me every other week so
that I can type them and turn them
in to the Davidsonian. ,

I know there‘s something to be
said for leaving an article the way
its author intended, but I never said
anything like that. So, everyone
that‘s exactly like me can rest as-
sured; I won‘tlethim offend youin
print.

But, as for the rest of you, read
at your own risk.

The People Speak

Like any good journalist (ugh-
huh), I listen to my readers. Since
the inception of my weekly col-
umn in this newspaper six weeks
ago, I have received scores of let-
ters and postcards. The Davidson
postmaster reviles my name--the
sheer volume of reader correspon-
dence is nearly overpowering for
his staff. Until recently, I con-
demned these letters to a dark cor-
ner in my closet, where they could
recycle themselves unread. But
I’ve had a change of heart. When
I last picked up
my mail, one of

you shore do rite purty. We dint
much lack yur refrunse to that thar
Shetland Pony insedint, but uther-
wize, you do us Davison grads rite
proud.

The Cat Square, N.C. Alumni
Association
Dear Friends:

Thanks, I think. I apologize
about the Shetland Pony thing--I
guess I’ve gota lot to learn about
multiculturalism. Never mind.

Dear Traitor:
Just

the postal work-
ers cornered me
on the loading
dock and said in
no uncertain
terms that all the
mail better be ac-
knowledged_ or
else. So here we
go:
Dear Sir:
Your
picure_hahaha_sory,

your picture is

who, pray tell,
do you think
you are? How
dare you be-
tray us. We
though you
were one of us,
but noooooo,
you had to
write a nice
little story for
the freshmen.
For goodness
sakes, Spain-
hour, have you

certainly capti- no resolve?
vating. Consid- Andrew Have you for-
ering the some- Spainhour gotten that we,
what forced look along with
upon your face, Dean Terry,
wecan’thelp but CCRL, and the

wonder exactly
whatit is that you are leaning upon.
Of more profound importance is
our desire that you be our poster
child. What do you say?
The National Association of

Proctologists
Dear Proctologists:
Anenticing offeris always hard

to turn down. I realize that you
organization has a deep impact
upon all of us, but I gave at the
office, and it’ll be a good, long
while before I go back there again.
Thanks, tho’.

Hay Andru:
Fur sumboddy frum Concord,

Patterson
Court Council. hoodwinked the
freshmen into thinking that they
couldn’t come to any of our par-
ties? Have you forgotten the magic
we created with a fake Dean of
Student’s Office stamp and a Xerox
machine? It was bliss. No fresh-
men were on upperclass halls, in
the apartments, or at our off-cam-
pus houses. The scam was perfect,
and what do you do, get ‘em ex-
cited about meeting us. Thanks a
lot.
Every Upperclassman Except You

Dear Lynch Mob:
Like, sorry guys, it won’t
happen again.

Now that I have cleared things
up here, it‘s time to move on to the
topic at hand; the race for Ostenta-
tious, Bothersome, Socially-Con-
scious, Unintelligible, Ranting,
Infectious, Tyrannical, Yes-men
(the race for OBSCURITY for
short) otherwise known as the
Democratic Presidential Primary.

It seems that Clinton, Kerrey,
Wilder, Tsongas, and Harkin (it
sounds like a really bad law firm)
have declared their intention torun
for the spot youcouldn‘t giveaway
a week ago. Let‘s look at their
qualifications one by one.

Bill Clinton: One of his sup-
porters explained her reasons for
supporting him as follows; “He
seems like a good Christian. He‘d
make a good President. Hey,
Jimmy Swaggart seemed like a
good Christian! Jim Bakker picked

up Jessica Hahn by telling her how
good of a Christian he was (in
bed)! Since when has this been a
qualification for the Presidency?
Thomas Jefferson was perhaps one
of the poorest Christians ever, but
he was a damn good President.
Bob Kerrey: He lost a limb in
war and dateda Hollywood starlet.
What, are we electing Captain
Hook here? Just because the Rus-
sians like a guy whose missing
some appendages, (Yeltsin: fin-
gers, for all of you who were
wondering what I was talking
about) do we have to do the same
thing? And, hey, just because
Kennedy and Reagan dated Holly-
wood babes, it doesn‘t mean that
every President has to do the same
thing! This election is one for the
President, not by Precedent!
Doug Wilder: His approval

rating in Virginia, where he was
elected Governor, is lower than the
oxygen content in the air at the top
of Mt. Everest. If you stay with
him too long, you‘ll die; it’s simple!

Paul Tsongas: I‘m going to
avoid the liberal Greek from Mas-
sachusetts jokes and just say this;
Tsongas rhymes with longest
which is the adjective we‘d use
before “Depression ever“ to de-
scribe what would happen if he
were Prez. And fortunately, the
word “longest‘ also describes his
chances!

Tom Harkin: He‘s from Iowa!
Yeah, right.

Well, it looks like we’re stuck
with Quayle and Bush for another
four years. It‘s just like Ben Fran-
klin always said, “A bird and a
Bush are better than a whole hand
of Democrats.“

Juries Needed By Honor Council

By Brian Jennings, '91

The following essay ran last
spring in the opinions section of
The Davidsonian. We are repub-
lishing the piece as we belive its
claims remain pertinent. For an
opposing viewpoint, please see The
Back Page Interview with Honor
Council Chairman John Howell.

As student solicitor, in the past
year I have served on every honor
council trial and investigated pos-
sible violations broughtto the Dean

of Students office. Through this —

experience and through conversa-
tions with numerous people about
the system, I have come to the
conclusion that something is se-
verely wrong with Davidson’s
“most cherished institution”. The
structure of the honor council needs
to be changed to a more demo-
cratic form.

Throughout the campus there
is a negative viewpoint associated
with the Honor Council and the
system in general. Over the past
year, I have asked people from
different groups around campus
(fraternity and eating house mem-
bers, independents, freshmen, and
faculty) about their impressions of
the system. Wrongly, the council
is often perceived as a group of
conservative headhunters, waiting
to kick someone out of school.
From this stemsa negative attitude
towards both the council and the
system. However, most of the
people that] have talked with would
not want to doaway with the Honor
Code, they just feel that the way
that it is set up is bogus - and they
are right!

Isee two reasons for this nega-
tive attitude. First, if people hear
of atrial orof someone being kicked
out of school, they usually do not
know the full story but only that of
the defendant. The majority of
honor trials are closed which is a
decision made by the defendant.
Everyone involved in the trial signs
aconfidentiality statement saying
that he/she will not discuss any of
the proceedings outside of the
court. The intent of aclosed trial is
to protect the defendant; however,
the end result is that the council is

viewed as a secretive group that
does not want anyone to know
what they aredoing. Unfortunately
ifthe defendantis found guilty, he/
she often tells friends that he/she

_was screwed over by the council.

Rumors get started, council mem-
bers have pledged their honor not
to discuss cases and thus can not
defend false accusations, and
people are left knowing just one
side of the story.

~ ; Second,,the selection ofcoun- ».
cil members hardly resembles flie ”

jury selection system of our state
and federal courts. Could you
imagine if elections were held for
local juries and these few people
were to hear all cases? In this
scenario, jury elections would
become very political andno doubt
anytime someone was found guilty
it would be blamed on those few
people elected to the jury. Al-
though elections for council
members are not very political, the
vision of the council as an exclu-
sive group remains. The Honor
Council consists of just three rep-
resentatives from the sophomore
class, six from the junior class, and
nine from the senior class.. Why
should we limit ourselves to sucha
select group to decide every case?

‘Why shouldn’tanyone who wants

to participate in the system atleast
have the chance to do so?

After giving the situation much
thought and looking into honor
systems at other colleges, I think

that the election of council mem- -

bers should be eliminated and
replaced with a self-selected jury.
Those that wanted to participate in
trials would have the chance and
those who do not want to would
not have to be bothered. All stu-
dents who sign up in the Dean of
Students office could be put into a
jury pool. This new larger council
would then select the Chairperson
and Secretary as the present coun-
cil does. Also, as in the present
system, the Chairperson would
direct the trials and the Secretary
would select the jury making sure
that no eating house or friendship
conflicts occurred between jurors
and the defendant.

The benéfits of this more
democratic system are numerous.
Enlarging the council to a jury
pool would give anyone the possi-
bility of serving on a trial if he/she

_wants. More students would have
‘the feeling that they are a part of

the honor system as opposed to
something that is enforced upon
them. Also, students would think
more about their own honor since
they would be making these deci-
SIONS Fee LET ES |
“**The’ system is* Supposed to
operate on the guidelines that prece-
dent is not to be followed in any
trial. However, after a council
member has served on numerous
trials, I think that it is difficult for
thatperson to holistically approach
a suspected violation as a separate
Situation, particularly if that coun-
cil member has served on related
cases. Having acompletely differ-
ent jury for each trial would truly
make each trial unique. Also, for
the most part the Davidson com-
munity is ignorant of what goes on
in a trial and how they are run.
Enlarging the council would edu-
cate more students on. the opera-
tion of the system. The miscon-
ceptions of the council would dis-
appear after more students served
on trials and were more closely
involved with the system,

Some critics of a more demo-
cratic council feel that allowing
anyone to serve on a 4rial would
decrease the caliber of decision
makers in the council and that
enlarging the council wouldelimi-
nate the confidentiality of trials.
One of the college’s attorneys told
the council last fall that Davidson
students are far more competent in
court situations than the average
person called up for jury duty. If
Davidson students have the intelli-
gence to serve in our governments
courts, then why would we be
unable to serve in our own school’s
judicial system?. As far as confi-
dentiality goes, why would any
student who is not on the council
be less confidential than the pres-
entmembers? Anyway thesecries
