_ Title IX compliance

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Asst. News Editor

Davidson College has taken
no official action towards com-
plying with the Title IX
requirements established by
Congress in July, 1975.

By July 21, 1976 the study:
of an as-yet unformed Title IX
Committee must be submitted
and proper grievance channels
for Title IX violations estab-
lished. This work must be
completed and Title IX must
be in effect at Davidson by
July 21, 1979.

Debaters overrun state title

The Davidson College For-
ensic Association closed out
the 1975-76 intercollegiate
competition by winning the
championship at the North
Carolina Forensic Association
State Tournament April 24th
in Raleigh.

The squad received the tra-
veling trophy, signifying the
overall sweepstakes title for
the first time in the history of
the college.

The varsity duo of sopho-
more Mark Gergen and senior

Gordon Widenhouse compiled
a perfect 4-0 record to sweep
the varsity title. They soundly
defeated arch-rival UNC-G
twice en route to the winning
the award for outstanding
speaker in the varsity divi-
sion, while Gergen took sec-
ond.

In the junior varsity divi-
sion, junior Nancy Northcott
and freshman Maria Patterson
combined to capture first place
honors, also with a 4-0 record.
Sophomore Ellen Ogilvie won
the top speaker award in the

Junior division, while North-
cott was second and Patter-
son third.

By dominating all phases of
the debate competition, Dav-
idson easily outdistanced sec-
ond place Appalachian for the
sweepstakes award in debate.

In the individual events
competition, senior Rick Roy-
lance captured top honors in

after dinner speaking, while.

Frazier Marsh, also a senior,
placed second in oral inter-
pretation of poetry.

Honors Center study drags
Slowly behind EPC’s sloth

By LYMAN COLLINS
Asst. News Editor

A faculty resolution passed
in April of 1973, asks that the
Honors Center undergo a ma-
jor reevaluation during the
academic year 1975-76.

Specifically the Repo ation

stated:
Resolved: that the Honors
College be continued at David-
son College for a period of
three years, to be reviewed
during the third year of its
operation [1975-76] by the
Educational Policy Committee
[EPC] of the Faculty.

In that same resolution it
was suggested that the name
Honors College be changed to
the Center for Honor Studies
and that the grading proce-
dures be realigned with the
rest of the college.

The issue at the time was
quite controversial and the
vote was extremely close with
38 for, 37 against and one
abstention; illustrating the
doubts many members of the
faculty had about the Honors
Center at that time.

Chairman of the EPC; Dr.
Frontis W. Johnston, also
Dean of Faculty and Academic
Vice President, reports that

the reevaluation is"

gress.’
He mea that the EPC

this year was undertaking an
overall study of the curriculum
and that the Honors Center
was merely a small part of that
study.

College President, Dr. Sam-
uel R. Spencer, Jr., reiterated
Johnston’s position.

“I asked the EPC to under-
take the overall study this
year. I assume that they are
including the Honors Center in
that report, but I’ve not heard
anything about it as yet,’’ he
said.

in pro-

Johnston explained that the .

EPC was divided into
numerous sub-committees and
that they were undertaking
the specifics.

“We've sent out a question-
naire to all faculty members
and to all the students enrolled
in the Honors Center,’’ said
Johnston. ‘‘But we haven’t
gotten back many responses
yet.”

The questionnaire, dated
April 26, 1976, examines each
faculty members’ personal
sassessment of the center. It
also seeks to determine if the
faculty understands its basic

workings and requests sug-
gestions for improving it,
including elimination of the
center.

‘‘We probably won’t have
our report ready before fall,”’
commented Johnston. ‘‘We
aim to have it ready for the
budgetary proceeding get
under way around Christmas.
The problem is that we really
didn’t get the job until this
winter, so we’ve only had a
couple of months to work on
it,” he continued.

“ And of course the commit-
tee gets scattered during the
summer months so we don’t
really get anything accom-
plished then. But we are
working on it (the reevalua-
tion) and that’s about all we
have to report at this time,”
he concluded.

With this issue THE DAVID-
SONIAN ceases publication
for the 1975-76 school year.
Publication will resume Fri-
day, September 17th, 1976 for
the 1976-77 year. THE
DAVIDSONIAN wishes
everyone a pleasant summer
and congratulations to the
Class of 1976.

which forbids discrimination
on the basis of sex in educa-
tional programs or activities
which receive federal funds.
“The President needs a
large bloc of time to sit down
and read all the information
about Title IX before affirma-

tive action can begin,’’ said
Assistant to the President
Rick Love.

‘‘We didn’t receive any
material on this until after
Christmas. I thought we
would get to work on it by
now, but other more pressing
matters have gotten in the
way,” said Love.

‘‘In a memo to President
Spencer im February, I out-
lined the basic steps we would
have to take by the July 21
deadline.

“The President must ap-
point a committee that will
evaluate Davidson's policies
and examine many facets of
school life, from dormitories to
academic opportunities to ath-
letic scholarships, to name a
few.

“This committee will sub-
mit a report pointing out areas
where the college does not
comply with Title IX guide-
lines and offering suggestions
for modifications.

“Then a grievance proce-
dure must be set up so that
people in the future may
complain officially about any
discrimination,” he continued.

“Some of the matters that
the committee deals with will
be very trivial, but others may
have considerable impact on
life at Davidson.”’

Love agreed that the stu-
dents should have some rep-
resentation on the important
evaluation committee and rec-

THE EDUCATIONAL POLICY COMMIT-

ognized the difficulty of
finding students to work with
the group during summer
months.

“T suspect that the commit-
tee will consider the report of
the Senate’s Coeducation
Committee in their study, so
some student input will come
from that. And there are
usually students here during
the summer. If the process
isn’t too long and drawn out,
some of them might be able to
help in the self-evaluation,”
said Love.

Emphasizing that Title 1X
applies not only to student
affairs but also governs mat-
ters pertaining to the faculty,
staff, and other personnel,
Love indicated that ‘‘finding a
committee chairman who can
work with all these groups
won't be easy.”’

Love could not say when the
work of forming the committee

‘‘Dr. Spencer may have
some timetable in mind, but
I’m not aware of it,’’ he
concluded.

Assistant Dean of Students
Mary Lou Dietler, actively
interested in Title IX and its
impact on Davidson, feels that
the self-evaluation process
‘‘won’t take as long as you
might think. This week I
attended a conference of Char-
lotte area colleges where,
among other matters, the
self-evaluation required under
Title IX was discussed,’’ she
said.

“I picked up some ideas for
our work here and will be
talking to Dr. Spencer about
the experience of other
schools, some of their proce-
dures and recommendations.”
