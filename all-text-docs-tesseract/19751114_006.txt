‘Magellan’ excites Jackson show

A REVIEW

Davidson’s artist in residence,
Herb Jackson opened a one-man show
in Charlotte Monday which is to run
through November 28. The title of the
show is “Prints 1971-1975,’’ and it
consists of 33 works executed during
the last 5 years.

The most important piece in the
show and the one which generates the
most discussion is a lithograph en-

titled ‘‘Magellan,’’ executed late last
summer. ‘‘Magellan’’ is a return to
what Jackson considers the looser
nore physical style that marked his
painting in the 50’s.

This is the style in which Jackson
feels most comfortable since it’s closer
to his original and it indicates what
kind of work can be expected from
him: in the near future.

The show is being held in the lower
levél of Montaldo’s on South Tryon
Street and is presented by the Mint

Museum. It is quite well arranged
with the works hung in two major
stylistic groups.

The lighting is quite poor in the
gallery, though, so visits should be
made during the daylight hours if at
all possible.

One of the most interesting features
of the show is that it allows the viewer
to trace Jackson’s development of the
theme that bursts out in ‘‘Magellan.”’

Beginning with‘a fine little piece
called ‘‘Sky Wall’’ there is a series
demonstrating the subtle colors and
hard edges that rench a climax in
“Element Suite’’ which Jackson him-
self calls ‘‘a milestone.”

But do not let the elements
overshadow other excellent works in
this group. ‘‘Cumulus” and ‘‘Strata’’
are also excellent examples of the
artist's style.

All of these works are composed of
Thousands of individual strokes
which combine to create barely per-
ceptable color gradations. This is then
combined with a simple geometrical
form inside of which.the shade is
markedly different from the subtle
field around it.

This sudden color change creates
the hard edges that Jackson considers
a stylistic mark of his work. This
juxtaposition of soft and hard ‘‘is
pleasing to look at but it does not
allow the artist to express the vitality

found in his paintings.

The tight style of Jackson’s hard/
soft works required long hours of
excruciating patience. When speaking
of the works in ‘‘Element Suite’’
Jackson remarked that ‘“‘those prints
took so damn long to draw it was

’

killing me.’

Gradually he evolved out of that
oppressive technique, and this pro-
cess is evident in a series of prints in

which the hand of the artist steadily
becomes more visible.

Noteworthy pieces in the transition
are. «Oriental. «summit. and

‘““Bloom”’ all of which show that, while.

the hard edges remain, the artist is
allowing himself more freedom with
each work.

Individual strokes begin to emerge
from the uniform background until
finally freed in ‘‘Magellan.’”’ This is
Jackson’s newest work and is by far
the most jolting piece in the show.

Composed of free slashes of color
against a stark white mat ‘‘Magellan’”’
possesses a power that earlier prints
lack.

It does not radiate or exude energy,
it bursts with it. For this reason
‘“Magellan’’ may take some getting
used to, but when seen in the context
of this show it is obviously the logical
outcome of the development found in
Jackson's recent work. That alone
justifies a trip to Charlotte.
