The Bavidsoniar

Open Dorms

‘Successful’

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

The Residence Hall Coun-
cil termed last weekend's ex-
periment in open dorms a
‘quiet success,’" at a meet-
ing Wednesday night.

According to chairman
Peter Hobbie, 53 students
participated in the program—
26 in Duke and 27 in Richard-
son, the two participating
dorms. Several faculty mem-
bers also visited the dorms
during open hours.

The Council now plans to
revise the Residence Hall As-
sociation (RHA) Constitution
in several areas during the
summer. One of the questions
to be answered by the revis-
ion will be whether a student
should be required to clean
up his room even if he does
not have a date, and does not
wish to participate in the
program.

This question arose because
of a lack of participation ir
cleaning up the dorms for
last weekend's experiment.

Council member C. L.
Cheshire commented. ‘Some
people might think that this
was a Mickey Mouse attempt
at having open dorms, but we
have to have something to
start with before we can ex-
pand the program."

He added that open dorms
would begin next year as soon
as the RHA Council was or-
ganized. Any dorm wishing

to have an open house would
apply to the Council.

The Council expressed its
appreciation for the efforts of
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts and Director of Student
Housing Mrs. Peter Nicholls.
“They have been extremely
helpful in setting up this ex-
periment,’ said Hobbie.

Foreign

Students
Critical

The letter to the editor
ptinted in last week's DA-
VIDSONIAN was the main
topic of discussion Monday
at a coffee hour for the Rich.
ardson Scholars.

The letter, signed by all of
the foreign students, listed
criticisms of the Richard-
son Scholars program. Mich-
ael Peltenburg. Richardson
Scholar from Switzerland,
said he hoped that the cof-
fee hour would serve as a
means of clarifying the is-
sues.

The most cutspoken of the
scholars was Lennart Voog
from Sweden. His criticisms
of the program differed
somewhat from those men-
tioned in the letter, however
he said that he thought that
changes needed to be made
in the program.

Voog's major criticism
was aimed at some of the
courses Richardson Scholars
take. He regarded it as a
“waste of time’ for him to
take such courses as Ameri-
can literature and history
because he did not have the
foundation or background to
fully understand the course.

Q&C REVIEWED

Mediocre Picture

A REVIEW
By ASHTON TRICE

The new edition of the
Quips and Cranks is out: oh
boy! This version seems to
have had an identical twin
brother that appeared two
years ago, and it is at most
as interesting as its predeces-
sor, .

I found this book to be
exactly what I imagined ‘it
would be: some sort of arche-
typal yearbook. ‘containing
every cliche known to edi-
tors.

“The photography is ade-
quate as a whole, but I seem
to have seen many of them
before in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, the Wildcat Handbook.
or in last year’s Q&C.

It would seem that a vear-
book is supposed to be a
work that offers an approach
to the college and not be just
a rehash of things seen be-
fore. so why not at least give
us something new to look at?

There is what seems to mé
to be a very beautiful picture
on page 177 (in the section
with the really neat heading
‘JJocks’) and I thought I
would point it out for those
who may have decided to go
that far back in the book.

It is really a sad state of
affairs when only one or two
pictures and absolutely no
copy in the yearbook stand
out in a favorable light.

ad

Well, at least there wasn't
anything gross.in the book.
It was really clean, very
Presbyterian.

Even the liquor bottles and
beer cans were made to blend
into the background.

The return to formal por-
traits for the seniors, the
superfluous copy which had
really no insights into the Da-
vidson Dilemma, and the gen-
eral lack of good. original
photography—and I mean
that I'm tired of seeing

Git’ Terriberry, freshman: It’s a
great idea, but I'm afraid it wouldn't
work. The fraternity system by its
nature is both social and exclusive. I %
think the extended rush system, as *
T've seen it working, accomplishes the
goal of allowing fraternity association
by everyone without destroying the
exclusiveness of the fraternities.

George Robinson, sophomore: From
the standpoint of the freshman and
from a personal view, I am partial to
a 100 percent bidding plan. However,
gne must also realize that 100 percent
would also cause many feelings to be
hurt as various freshmen were pushed
into corners by unwilling fraternities.
I personally feel that everyone has a
place, but in reality it wouldn't work

John Rowe, sophomore: Since we
have only had the extended rush sys-
tem for one year, we should try it at
least for one more rush period. It
seems to one that it is presently work-
’ ing out in a way which pleases the

ROBINSON

George Shaw, senior: The 100 per-
cent plan is essentially a good idea.
But I'm not sure how popular it would
be with the faculty or the students.
Such a proposition would make it
easier on those, who would otherwise
feel badly about not receiving a bid.

Retiring Bursar McGill:
Students Still The Same

The type of person attend-
ing Davidson has not changed
significantly in the last half
century, according to M. W.
McGill, retiring bursar and
assistant treasurer.’

McGill has .been associated
with Davidson for 46 years.
During this time he has held
positions of business manager
of the. athletic association.
bursar, and assistant treas-
urer. McGill started his .ca-
reer at Davidson following
graduation in 1922 as the ad-
ministrator of a fund cam-
paign to rebuild Chambers
Building.

McGill said that the pri-
mary change in the make-up
of the student body was the
decreasing number of minis-
ter’s sons and pre-minister-
fal students.

**Human nature being what
ft is.’ he said, “I doubt f+
the boys here have changed
much,.”' said McGill.

“We had to find our devil-
ment here on campus,” said
McGill of his student days.
“There were very few cars,
so we went everywhere by
train. . . students attended a

‘local movie regularly."

He reminisced. on the days
when the. Davidson football
teams played North Carolina
and Virginia. “‘At that time
the field was a bowl, with
mostly wooden bleachers go-
ing all the way around the.
field. It was always full, and
we had very respectable gate
receipts.”

Only five of the buildings

and cloudy pictures of our

a disappointment.

I certainly hope that next

next year’s annual that will

After starting with a few

A REVIEW
By BOB DUNHAM

Ashton Trice’s review of
the new annual is out; oh
boy! This review seems to be
identical to most reviews of
most typical annuals, and_ it
is at most as interesting as
its predecessors.

I found this review to be
exactly what I imagined it
would be: some sort of arche-
typical review. containing
every cliche known to the
writer.

But the review is inade-
quate as a whole, and since I
have seen most of the argu-
ments before, I'd like to take
an opposing viewpoint.

I found the new Quips and
Cranks to be a very good
yearbook. It was as the edi-

I don’t know what Mr.
Trice’s concept of a good pic-
ture is — perhaps he wants
the beer cans in focus with
the people blending into the
background — but I found
some excellent photography
in the new annual.

T liked the informal pic-
tures last year, too, but if
the editors had merely re-
produced another annual of
that type. it would have
aroused even more gripes.

I thougat the copy was any-
thing but superfluous. I sug-
gest that Mr. Trice reread
the copy — maybe he was
reading the wrong annual. I

tioning, rather than a repeti-
tion of often used cliches.
The major disappointment
in the annual was the failure
on the editors’ part to capture
the spirit of change that
swept the campus this year.

The church photograph and |

a few pieces of copy were all
that came close to its repre-
sentation.

But students. at Hattie's,
laughing deans, flies in the

Davidson. To delete them

practical ‘and non-Davidson.

have rennovated and innovat-
ed, and the result is some-
thing new: practical artistry.

Kelly added that the pub-

was not an important cause
of riots. He said that it. was
extremely important that the

He said that he believes
that Davidson is doing a good
job for the students. ‘I've

about go on to become suc-
cesses."

McGill declined to give any
personal opinions on the cur-
rént changes in the school
curriculum and student life.

‘Less’ Dip’
Slated For

Orientation

“Less dip and more sub-
stance’ is the guiding prin-
ciple for next year's fresh-
man orientation, said John
Gilmore and Larry Slade. co-
freshman advisers.

Gilmore and Slade said an
attempt will be made to cut
down on the, amount of

ing with hall counselors and
in taking advantage of hall
discussions.

As in past years, the YMCA
Freshman Camp will operate
as a complement to orienta-
tion, giving freshmen a
chance to met each other and
student leaders in a informal
atmosphere.

The format of the freshman
camp will remain essentially
the same, though it will begin
a day earlier than usual so
that the students will return
in time for a banquet in
which welcoming speeches
will be given.

In an attempt to make
orientation something mean-
ingful, Slade and Gilmore are
“going to try to take advan-
tage of the freshmen’s early
enthusiasm and_ interest,”
Gilmore said.

“We're very idealistic about
instilling in the freshmen
pride in and spirit for their
college and their class.

Though this might become a
little discouraging later on,
we're going to enter this thing
with as much enthusiasm as
possible,"’ he said.

Union Door Open

The College Union will re-

the rest of the school year,
according to Sam Boyte, stu-
dent assistant to the Union
director.

Coffee and donuts will be
available for free beginning
Tuesday night. he said.

In addition, movies are
scheduled for most nights
during the period.

“The Chapman’ Report”
will run for the last time
tonight. Next week, “Wild
Thing” will alternate with
“Invisible Horror."’ ‘‘Girl in

movies begin at 8 p.m. in the

TRAWF, which apparently
had become a Union tradi-
tion, may not continue or —
may be replaced, Boyte said.
Whether funds are available
for it is not yet known, he
explained.

THE DAVIDSONIAN sug-
gested in an editorial two
weeks ago that the Union be
kept open all night as a
place for students to study,
and as a way to make life
for students ‘‘a little more
bearabie.”’
