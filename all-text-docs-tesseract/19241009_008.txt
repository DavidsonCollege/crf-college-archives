can be combatted is by use of the prin-

Church was organized to fight the evils

do so after a scientific study has been

Dr. McConnell is Back
After Extended Illness

Popular College Physician Again
Resumes Duties in Class Room
and Infirmary

The students of Davidson extended to
Dr. J. W. MacConnell a most hearty wel-
come last week as he appeared in chap-
cl, ready to resume his work, which has
been delayed by his recent illness.

After taking a pleasure trip*to Canada
and Niagara in the earlier part of the
summer, Dr. MacConnell worked for a
month in a New York hospital. From
there he returned to Davidson to again
take up his work as college physician and
instructor in Physiology and Hygiene,
but immediately after the opening of col-
lege, illness necessitated his going to the

Charlotte Sanatorium where he was
treated for ten days.
Dr. MacConnell is glad-to~be -back

again. He says that he is feeling fine,
and aside from a slight loss in weight
he doesn’t appear to have been greatly
affected by his confinement. He is very
physical condition,
having expressed his belief that he will
be able to carry out entirely his work!
for the year. Certain rumors would have
{it that Dr. MacConnell will have to re-
{turn sometime in the near future for an |
| operation, but unless unfavorable devel- |
}opments take place this will not be nec-
essary before next summer.
