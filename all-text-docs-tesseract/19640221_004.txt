Just File As |

BY JOHN TODD

Aspiring students who
wish to run in the Student
Body elections next month
will have to file as candi-
dates themselves instead of
being nominated by another
student, according to the
changes recently adopted
by the Student Council in
the Elections Procedure By-

Laws.
The elimination of the nomina

tion procedure will greatly re-
duce the number of candidates,
the Council hopes, and is one of
several changes to streamline all
of the elections.

In years past so many stud-
ents were nominated by their
‘best friends’’ that it often re-
quired three or four days to

complete the run-off elections.
Instead of lasting nearly a
month, this year's elections
should not last more than ten
days,. said Council | President
John Spratt.

In a further step to permit
limited campaigning and to keep
the dullness out of the elections,
each candidate will be allowed
to distribute 200 copies of his
platform ‘‘which will be stated
in a fair and factual manner.”
The printing costs will even be
paid by the Student Council.

The balloting has been reduced
from five to three categories:
1. Student Body Officers and
Honor Court; 2. YMCA, Fresh-
man Adviser, Publications Edi-
tors, College Union President,
and cheerleaders; and 3. Student

Council representatives.

Also, no student can be a can-
didate for both an Honor Court
position and a Student Body of-
fice,

Definite dates for the elec-
tions will be set soon by the
Elections Board, which the
Council named at its meeting
Monday night. The group in-
cludes one senior from each of
the 12 social fraternities and
four non-fraternity seniors, plus
a student council member who
serves as chairman.

Spratt also said that new ballot
boxes have been ordered for
these elections and that the NSA-
oriented voting cards will be
distributed again to each stud-
ent.

‘National Review’ Story:
Martin Sounds Rebuttal

Editor’s note: The following letter by President D. Grier Martin was originally addressed
to Dr. William H. McCorkle, moderator of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. (Southern).
The letter was distributed in mimeographed form to members of the Board of Trustees prior

to their meeting Wednesday.

There were more than a hun
dred questions in the survey,
many of them complex and un
doubtedly tedious and somewhat
boring for college students, even
though they are accustomed to
lengthy tests. . .

You may not know that all of

the broad sweeping statements
about the number and the per-
centage of students believing
certain things are based on an-
swers from 7% of the combined
number of sophomore, junior
and senior undergraduates. The
questionnaires were mailed and
in some cases handed out per-
sonally. If fewer than 7% replied,
new mailings were sent. It was
reported that excesses were
scientifically discarded. (One
could wonder about the meaning
of ‘‘scientifically."’)
» The Davidson students ques-
tioned were in the midst of their
planned educational program at
Davidson including the required
courses in religion. In these
courses they are forced to ex-
amine their own faith and to
raise questions. Students in other
institutions not confronted
through such courses in religion
never really examine such issues
as are raised by these questions
in the National Review Survey.
It is therefore likely that often
the religious questions are ignor-
ed and little growth or religious
maturing takes place where
there is no exposure... .

Evidence is strong at David-
son that a sizeable number of
our students treated the entire
questionnaire as a joke and
that others found opportunities
in parts of the survey to ex-
hibit their senses of humor.
For example. the survey re-
ported that 20 members of the
Davidson student body indi-
cate nursing as their intended
field of concentration!

The report also stated that 4
(40) of the Davidson students
were reared as Roman Catholics
and that 6° (60) students were
Catholics at the time of the sur
vey. Official Davidson records

for the years in which the sur
vey was made show that there
were only 5 Catholics in the
student body at any one time
and 3 of these were foreign stud
ents at Davidson for a one-year
Stay.

This represents an error of
1100% and is suggestive of the
probabilities of error in other
categories. In spite of this the
Christian Observer says that ‘‘on
a number of predominantly Pro
testant campuses—ranging in
character from Yale to Davidson
to Howard and Indiana—the
Roman Catholict Church has ap
parently won a significant num
ber of converts. ..."

Passing over the catastrophes
which are possible with a 7%

sample of admittedly. impatient
and at times intolerant students,
we should consider the import-
ance. of the conditions under
which courses of religion are
given at these colleges, how
many students take them, and
any other factors having a bear-
ing on the reactions and atti-
tudes of students.

At Davidson every student
questioned would have had at
least one year of required work
in Bible and religion, and many
of them would have completed
the two years required of every
student who attends Davidson.

No other non-Catholic college
in the survey has any require-
ment approaching this and the
vast majority of their students
naturally would net be affected
by courses in religion. In addi-
tion, students at Davidson are
required to attend a large per-
centage of the religious services
held twice a week on the David-

son campus.

There is little doubt that re-
quired courses in religion and
required attendance at two
weekly religious services re-
sult—for the moment—in hos-
tile students. Because of these
and other reasons, there is a
“reaction against religion’
which has been expressed at
Davidson through the years,
and much of it was expressed
by men who have gone on to
provide much of the minister-
ial and lay leadership in
churches throughout the South
and in many other areas of the
country.

It is not abnormal or unusual
for men who are required to
think about any area of learning
to “react” against some of their

earlier thoughts on the subject.
Davidson students are encourag
ed to think through these areas
with their own minds and not
just memorize what is in the
Bible or textbook, or. what
given in the teacher's lecture, so
that they can repeat it.on the
next examination.

It is significant that the David
son students polled indicate by
sizable majorities their continu-
ed allegiance to the Christian
faith and to their churches, with
88° of the sample stating their
intention of rearing their chil-
dren in their own religious tra-
dition. 86% indicating substan-
tial or partial agreement with
the religious tradition in which
they were reared, and 81% be-
lieving God to be all-power
| ee

Would it not be more appro-
priate to look at the record
which Davidson men have

made after graduation and af-

ter they have had a chance to
reflect on their ‘‘reaction’”’ to
religion, and on the develop-
ment of their faith and char-

is

by
is

acter and service as they have
taken positions of leadership
in their churches and com-
munities? ...

Greater knowledge and _ con-
cern prevents Davidson students
from accepting the over-simple
answers to complex religious
questions.

This is consistent with the edu-
cational program of the college
which encourages students to
think for themselves and which
does not wish to be merely an
indoctrination center. The col-
lege attempts to give the un-
usually able Davidson students
the opportunity to come to grips
with the basic doctrines of Chris-
tianity while they are in touch
with a committed faculty of a
Christian college.

NEVIN‘S SCHOOL
Gift Fund Holds Out Hai

Students Choose Nevin's

For Y's Easter Gift Fund

BY BILL AITKEN

Nevin's Vocational School of
Charlotte, polling 300 votes, was
chosen by the student body as
recipient of the Easter Gift Fund
over the Ministry to Migrant
Workers with 106 votes and the
Save. the Children Foundation
with 101.

Jeff Wampler, chairman of the
Gift Fund, said in speaking of
the project, “‘In the Gift Fund
we have the opportunity to make
a tangible and positive contri
bution toward aiding these peo-
ple. They are not just charity.
We are enabling them to receive
training to live useful lives on
their own.”

Wampler noted also that the
balloting indicated 50 per cent
of the student body participated
in the voting, which is unusual
even in student body elections.

Nevin's is a trade school
operating in the old Mecklen-
burg County school house on a
yearly budget of $14,000 which
is provided wholly by service
clubs. The school receives no
church, state or federal funds.

Nevin's enrolls men between
the ages of 16 to 45 on a volun-
tary basis. These men with IQ's
from 20 to 80 participate in a
combined program including
recreation, training in repetitive
skills and fundamentals of ele-
mentary education.

The building in which the
school is housed provides inade-
quate space and is in need of
repair. At present a basketball
goal and facilities for woodwork,
pottery, and: painting are all
housed in a small gym. Automo-
bile engines are located out-of-
doors because of the cramped
conditions inside the building.

The Easter Gift Fund will com-
pletely build and equip a new
workshop for the school. The
goal of $2,300-is the sum given
by the school as adequate for

this project.
Soliciting begins Monday,
Feb. 24, and continues until

Friday, March 13. In case of
any question concerning the
Fund, a list of the solicitors on
each hall will be posted in all
dorms.

When Burl Rainwater (B.A., 1958) reported to Southern
Bell in 1961, he coordinated the Bell System Census Project
in Tennessee. Working out his own guidelines for collect-

growth during the Sixties for each telephone exchange

Success on this assignment earned him a new one where
he also had to pioneer. When told to study the possible

The textbook the two men developed for the machines was
later copyrighted and published. :

With such achievements behind him, Burl is now carry-

Burl Rainwater, like many young men, is impatient to
make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
