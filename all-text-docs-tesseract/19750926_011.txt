The Davidson soccer team
travelled to Virginia only to
return home on the short end of
a 3-1 score. Coach Chip Stone
cited the soggy field as the
main factor in the loss.

“The wet field definitely
limited our ball control game,”
he said, “but we should be able
to perform under any cond-
itions.”

Stone added that Virginia did
a good job of “forcing us out of
our game.”

The Wildcats dominated the
action most of the way. The
Cats netted the game’s initial
goal about twenty minutes into
the first half.

Davidson’s Paul Schleifer

scored about five minutes later
to tie the score. The Cats were
in charge the rest of the half,
but trailed 2-1 at the intermis-
sion on what Stone called “a
helluva play by the referee.”

With about two minutes left
in the half, Virginia had a
corner kick. Just as the ball
was kicked, the substitution
horn sounded. All the Davidson
players stopped, but a Cavalier
headed the ball into the net.
After a considerable debate,
the goal was allowed.

“So instead of going into the
second half with the momentum
and a tied score, we were
behind and mentally down.”
noted Stone.

The Cats were in control
again during much of the second

half but could not put the ball
into the net. When Virginia
scored with less than ten min-
utes to go, the Cats were
virtually doomed.

Stone labeled the defensive

efforts of Gary Dancigar and |

Phil Barringer outstanding and
also credited goalie Bob Perz
with a fine performance.

“We made three mistakes
and they capitalized on them,”
he commented. “And they took
the middle of the field away
from us, Tommy Blackwood
(center forward) was not even a
factor in the game.”

The Cats will try once more
to get into the win column
tomorrow in a home contest
against the University of North
Carolina.

For the first time in two
years, representatives of the
administration, faculty, trust-
ees, athletic department, and
Wildcat Club met last week to

discuss Davidson's athletic
program.

“It was a roundtable type of
discussion which dealt with two
basic areas.” said Athletic
Director Thom Cartmill. “We

Duncan Winds Up Athletic

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Staff Writer

As versatile in sports as he is
talented,-Joe Duncan’s career
in Davidson athletics would be
difficult to surpass.

Duncan has accumulated a
total of 11 letters in soccer,
football, baseball and basket-
ball as well as being a perrenial
standout in IMAC competition.
Probably best known for his
kicking abilities in football, the
senior booted a 52-yard field
goal last year against Hamp
den-Sydney, setting a school
record.

Not content with just partic-
ipating in sports, he has co-au-
thored an IMAC sports column
for The Davidsonian over the
past three years, as well as
coached the girls’ basketball
team in its initial two seasons.

Spending so much time in’
athletics, Duncan has a special
insight in the area of sports at
Davidson. On the subject. of
de-emphasizing the football
program he feels that it ‘was a
good move that will benefit the
entire Davidson sports pro-
gram.

“This places more emphasis
on the minor sports and David-
son has a great future in things
like golf and baseball---sports
that other schools don't throw
their whole budget into”, Dun-
can pointed out.

Davidson's high academic
standards can pose serious
problems when trying to re-
cruit top notch athletes in both
football and basketball and
Dunean believes that steps
should be taken to remedy this

situation.

“J think that Davidson is
pretty good about taking peo-
ple who have something to offer
besides high SAT’s”, he stated.
“But lowering the academic
standards for athletes is neces-
sary to compete successfully in
football and basketball.”

Although no policies were
officially changed or instituted,
the meeting served a construct-
ive purpose as a list of general
priorities was agreed upon. The

ever, that coaches could not be
undergraduates and that Dav-
idson was in violation of the
rules. As of yet, a new coach
has not been named for the
girls team. Duncan is under-
standably upset by the school
inaction.

“This is a bitter point with
me because the school is doing a
good job of sloughing the
matter off right now”, Duncan
stated. “Practice starts in less
than a month and they don’t

are excellent players and be-
sides they're hot dogs just like
every one else. They like to

When Duncan completes his
academic career and leaves
Davidson at the end of this
quarter, he plans to take a shot
at pro football as a kicking
specialist. But even after he has
departed, legend of “Young

co-authord the IMAC sports
column in The Davidsonian for
three years which was an
extremely popular Davidson
institution.

Duncan's former roommate,
Gregg Dunn, became Captain
America after a particularly
disheartening freshman mixer
with Queens which prompted
him to put on a _ costume
resembling that of the comic
book héro Captain America.

Later in the year, Duncan's
freshman hall decreed that he
become C.A’s_helper-- Young
Buck.

“They dressed me up in a
black wet suit with a cape and a
baseball bat,” Duncan recalls.
“C.A. would dictate the punish-
ment and I would beat the
offenders with my bat.”

C.A. is gone and Y.B. will’

leave after fall break, but not
before making one final predic-
tion on the championship of
A-league basketball.

“It’s gonna be the SAF’s and
the THI’s all the way,” the
flamer exclaimed.

contention for the Southern
Conference championship,
scholarships on a need basis
were established, and a more
competitive schedule in line
with these changes was agreed
upon.

“We've got another year to
go before we can come to any
definite conclusions about these
changes,” Cartmill said.

With a new program and a
new coach, Cartmill felt that it
would not be fair to pass any
judgment upon football with
out giving the program several
years to become settled.

The possibility of elevating
one of Davidson’s minor sports
to a major sport status was
brought up, according to
Cartmill.

“We discussed the feasibility
of making golf or tennis a major
sport,” Cartmill admitted.

“All of our opponents in these
sports provide scholarships
while we don’t. So if we were to
emphasize another sport it
would logically be in one of
these areas, especially tennis
where we have such a good
facility.”

Cartmill said that the meet-
ing also recognized the need for
a new atheletic facility in the
future, but that nothing was
formally organized in that
direction. Although there is a
definite need for a new athletic
facility at Davidson, it must
take a back seat at least until
the problem of student housing
has been taken care of.

“I think it is important that
we should start some formal
planning in this direction
though,” Cartmill stated.

By formal planning, Cartmill
meant that a list of necessary
facilities and the spaces needed
to house them should be drawn
up. The stress in any new
athletic facility will be placed
on, “recreational needs of the
student body,” he said.
Cartmill felt that any new
facility should include more
