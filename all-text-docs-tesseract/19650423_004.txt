Dr. Ernest Patterson returned
in chapel Tuesday. His critical

its relevancy now, was the fact
that it was greeted then ‘by
fainting and epileptic seziure,”’
while it was accompanied Tues-
day by laughter and applause
and even a tape recorder.

Patterson first asserted the
need for the United States to
take the lead in establishing

peace, freedom and prosperity
as soon as possible. A solution

for increasing skepticism to help
democracy. One should not al-
ways join the group, for then he
is- not able to.critize as effec-
tively or as loudly.

He pointed to McCarthyism as
an example of over-zealous be-
lief in democracy killing democ-
racy itself. We must be awake
to the dangers to freedom, from
the House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee to the Ku Klux

of sacrificing the have's for the Klan. We must develop new ends

against Henry Luce and the ir-
responsibility of the press, re-
ferring to his burgeoning file of

for looking past the Russians in:

THE, DAVIDSONIAN

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

In the fall of 1960, hid-
den deep within the ranks
of the class of 65, was an ob-
scure little freshman named
Charles Lemmon Dibble. To-
day this same Charles Dib-
ble is known to all as one of
the “biggest men on cam-
pus” and the “Editorial
Voice of Davidson College,”
the editor-in-chief of THE
DAVIDSONIAN. But, alas,
Charley’s days of editorial
glory are over and he has
been forced to retire into
the same _ semi-obscurity
from which he arose.

In the past year Charley has
enlarged THE DAVIDSONIAN
to a regular six-page issue, while
improving the quality tremen-
dously. His work in this direc-

that our children are now shoot-
ing Russians instead of Indians
in their games. What has hap-
pened? After an explanation of
our foreign aid policy, the chil-

tion was so able, in fact, that
he has gained for THE DAVID-
SONIAN an All-American rating
among college newspapers for
1964-65.

SHARP EDITORIALS

The outstanding feature of ev-
ery “Dibble paper” was its edi-
torials, always sharp and to the
point, even if seldom agreed
with. The main editorial issue
was the fraternity question. Ev-
ery week, from Young's first
talk in chapel, new develop-
ments and opinions were pre-
sented both in news and edi-
torial form. The climax of this
coverage came in the issue of
March 12 when editor Dibble
finally expressed himself edi-
torially as endorsing ‘without
qualification the report of the
Fraternity Evaluation Commit-
tee.”’

This was one of the most dif-
ficult things Dibble had ever
done, for, as he himself said in
that editorial:

* “Without any doubt, this ed-
itorial has caused us more
pain and anguish ‘than any
other statement in the past
year, and not without reason.
Our association with the fra-
ternity system has always
been friendly, and in our four

; years at Davidson our rela-
tionship with the system has
been increasingly close."’

A DELICATE POSITION

Needless to say, this editorial
‘ aroused feelings on both sides of

delicate position in which he
had placed himself, had known
it would. Some criticized him for
taking advantage of the system
and then “stabbing it in the
back.” (Dibble, while not a
member of a fraternity; is an
affiliate of two different campus
fraternities.) Others accused
him of using THE DAVIDSON-
TAN as a platform for his own
views, instead of those of the
student body. Still others ap-
plauded his decisiveness and
courage to say and print exact-

ly what he thought on this im-
portant issue. None, however,

could deny that in all the weeks
since the issue first arose it had
been treated fairly and impar-
tially by PHE DAVIDSONIAN.

Now that it is all over and the
cares and duties of editorship
have been lifted from him, Dib-
ble can be seen wandering
around campus or up at Hattie’s
with a vague look of restlessness
in. his eyes, and a readiness to
give his views on any subject at
all, whether he is conversant
with it or not.

In regards to his successor
and staff Dibble stated ‘His
(Todd's) first paper ‘vas a very
good paper (for a first paper).
His second paper was as good

as anything he'll put out in the
. he is doing a good °

next year...
job.””

LOOKING AHEAD

The only answer he gave when

chapel, as Dr. Patterson's al-| the question as Dibble, in the asked if his, year at the helm

ways are. His closing poem de-
serves quotation:

Hush-a-bye baby, down in
the ground,

When the bomb bursts, you
won't hear a sound.

You'll come tonoharm from
the trouble and strife,

Provided you stay here the

cans and the Latin Americans. 4

There was some organized line

of antagonistic succession devel- ;

oped.

The problems of the American
democracy were then discussed.

Students’ Adoptions

Increase In

Apparently in response to a
need for companionship sorely
missing from -the college com-
munity, the Easter season has
brought an influx of pets.to the
halls of Davidson.

Two unidentified juniors are
maintaining a duck named
“Claps’’—in honor of a frater-
nity brother's girl. .The two
pledged to be good parents... .
“no dates until he's old enough
but we'll have him smoking and
dancing in two months.”

The two proud parents take
“Claps”’ on excursions to ‘the
soothing waters of Lake Nor-
man." With typical parental con-

Number

cern, they were critical of the
techniques of their peers.

Two chickens residing down
the hall, they reported, were be-
ing brought up to be fighters.
“They're mean because they're
not fed and because their own-
er continually throws them into
the air and lets them flutter
down .. .” Their names were
unprintable.

Word was received about two
other ducks (one a gift from
Converse) and a cat being main-
tained on campus. Nothing larg-
er was uncovered but as was
pointed out **. . . a pet doesn’t
have to be large to be compan-
ionable.”’

Bennett High School, Kingsport,
Tennessee, is the son of Mrs.

port and the late Mr. S. C. Ait-
ken.

last three years, recipient of a

had been worth it was “Defi- . a

nitely,”” but his reply to how he
felt now that it is out of his
hands was a forceful, ‘Liber-
ated!"

At the present Dibble claims
he is suffering from an acute
case of spring fever which, he
claims, is rare for him because,
“In previous years I have had
to ignore all the frightening
symptoms of spring fever, risk-
ing my health for THE DAVID-
SONIAN. This year I must be
more introspective and take
care of myself.” His interests
now have turned to ‘‘the pending
trustee meeting... the lake...
classes ... causes... Hattie’s”
and getting out of Davidson. He
is “counting on finishing this
summer,"’ but expresses some
amount of question as to wheth-
er he really will or not. The
main reason is THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, but he also blames the
‘very bad attitude toward those
subjects in the curriculum I
have taken."’ Even when he has
interested himself in’a partic-
ular subject he feels that it is
the ‘‘Omnipotent. Clock’’ which
has deprived him of the time to
pursue these interests.

FUTURE PLANS

Dibble’s plans for the future,
provided that he gets out-of Da-
vidson, are indefinite. He hopes
to go to the University of Vir-
ginia Law School, and if not,
“I'll work awhile, travel awhile

newspaper work ... any-
thing I can get in the way of a
job. Future? Either law or jour-
nalism . . . nothing definite any
time soon.”

In looking back over his en-
tire career at Davidson, Dibble
summed it up by saying. “At
Davidson I have done what I
have wanted to do. Consequent-
ly, 1 think I have gotten a very
good Nberal arts education while
compiling an outstanding rec-

ord as an ‘underachiever’.
