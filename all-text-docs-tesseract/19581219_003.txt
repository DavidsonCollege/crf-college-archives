Sports
All That

By JIM HAMILTON

After last week’s interview with Coach Tucker, fear-
ing a summons from the executive committee or the
like, I figured that I'd better elevate the contents of this
column, so I went down to the gym to visit assistant
wrestling coach Evans who I reasoned would be fairly

.safe subject, since he is also a professor in the Bible

department.

Evans was on the mat so I kicked off my shoes and
walked over to where he was working out with redhead
Milton Gee. At present Gee was the victim of a cradle
hold that had him flat on his shoulders, his feet up in
the air. So I sat down to watch what I figured would
be a good match, since Milt is one of the most capable
men on the team and the coach is one of the better grap-
plers in Davidson history.

They squared off again with Milt on the top. After
a few moments of sparring Gee yelled, “Watch this.”
A few deft movements and Milton was back on his
shoulders, feet again flopping high above his head.

Undaunted, Milt tried again.

“Where're you going,” said Evans, resting his head
on his hand for comfort as Gee strained futily for a leg
hold.

“Thinks he’s smart,” Milt gasped.

] had to agree with the good professor's opinion
because thirty seconds later Milton was back in his now
familiar upside down position.

Gee, abashed, retorted in self defense “How much
do you weigh, anyhow.” (The professor did have about a
thirty pound edge on his nimble opponent.)

I’m sure Evans had an appropriate answer, but
about that time they rolled on top of me, so I had to
quit writing.

Can you honestly say you never imitate
the manner of an executive or leader
you admire?

Are you entirely confident that you
would not get “‘lost’’ if you worked
for a large firm?

When driving or walking for some
distance, do you like taking short

. cuts rather than a longer route you
know will get you where you're going?

In going to the movies, do you consult
the reviews first rather than just
take “pot luck’’?

Davidson Entertains As Host
In Carrousel Tournament

By PETE WYRICK

After a couple of impressive victories over Pfeiffer and Washington and Lee
and a close defeat at Catawba, the Wildcat basketball squad went back on the road
this week for two important contests. .

On Wednesday night the
‘Cats met William and Mary in
a conference game. Coach Tom
Scott calls the W & M team “a
fine bail club with some real
big boys.” Scott probably sent
his usual starting five against
the Indians, but started John
Stafford inplace of “Red” Fer-
guson, height being a decisive
factor.

Talking over results of
previous games this season,
Coach Scott seemed pleased
with the improvement his
team has been showing, es-
pecially in the scoring de-
partment. Scott indicated
that team scoring has gone
up in latter games and a
primary reason for this has.
been due to getting the ball
in play and up the floor fast-
er.

However, the scoring load is;

still resting on three men.
These three, Hollingsworth,
Shinn, and Mintz have been in
the double figures consistently.

Scott was also high in his
praise for sophomore Jim

NuckolNs who “is really show: |

ing improvement this year.”

“This team could easily run
up a hundred points against us
if we don’t play good ball, but
we will be playing a control
type of game, waiting for only
the best shots. If we play well,
we could win.”

The. other debutant, 157-Ib.
senior John Poindexter, has
been the intrd-mural champion
in wrestling for the past three
years. “If he had started three
years ago,” Parker says, “he
would have been tremendous
now. He has the natural. talent
and scrapping drive to make a
real wrestler. He's the argu-
mental type—has to be shown.”
Poindexter, on Davidson's ‘ten-

swatted last season as No. 2
man.

Coach Parker said, “You

Frosh Ball Club

Looks Promising

By BOB GREENE
The outlook for Davidson’s freshmen cagers is
bright as play adjourns for the Christmas holidays. The
Wildkittens have a 2-2 non-conference record and re-

sume play January 10.

Thirteen hard-working boys
comprise the ‘58-59 edition of
the Kitten cagers which is po-
tentially the best freshmen
team Davidson has had in
many years. Jerry Bussell, a
speedy playmaker from Lafay-
ctte, Ind., handles the right
guard position, hitting from
outside and inside with two-
hand sets and jump shots. He
is an exceptional ball handler
and passer, having his best
game against Pfeiffer when he
bucketed 27 points.

LEFTHANDER
Tom Harris, a_ left-hander,
teams with Bussell at left guard
and hits the double figures
from the outside with a one-
hand jump and a two-hand set

~

Foy :

shot. Harris, a graduate of Oak-
ridge, hails from Elkin.

The forwards are Allen Mil-
lar and D. G. Martin. Allen
stands 6’ 4", uses a jump shot
and hooks from the post. This
Raleigh youth is usually in the
double figures and should de-
velope into a fine ball player.
Martin is the team’s leading
rebounder and guns from the
inside with a jump shot. The
North Mecklenburg. star is
rapidly developing an outside
shot.

CENTERS

Ronnie Anderson, 6’ 6", and
Bob Moore, 6’ 5”, sharing the
duties at center. Anderson is
an aggressive scrapper and
hooks with cither hand. He is
also accurate from the outside
and is learning constantly.
Moore is the same size-and-type
player as Anderson and Coach
Hunt is playing both boys
equally.

The Kittens’ versatility lies
mainly in 6° 3” Frank Weaver,
This Chapel Hill playmaker
works (at. guard and forward
and will be one of the better
players when he develops more
speed.

Other frosh hardwocders are

shi Shuvp and Andy Sherrill
(guards), Graham Showalter,
Randy Austin, Worth. William-
son and Wyche Fowler (for-
wards). :

Coach Wunt stated that. his
tram has a lot of team spirit
and is working hard to de-
velope a winning squad.
