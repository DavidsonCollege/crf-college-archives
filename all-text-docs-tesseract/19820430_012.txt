Home for-the handicapped, Paris

When they dangle a shoe
from the second floor
their laughter falling

to the frozen street

you are in the right place.

When the wall’s all red tulips
and Raymond sings

and Gilles know the capital
of Gabon, everyone claps

and you are in the right place.

When Simone and Anne dance, Anne
holds Simone’s shaking shoulders
and Raymond sings Ave Maria

while Jacques conducts and

everyone claps-

and Robert tells you all he knows
about Superman, and Sophie does
doughnut loops by the door

and someone brings you caviar

and everyone claps, and you—
you dance, and Raymond claps

and sings Ave Maria .
higher and higher—

Chris Gunn ‘84

and you are in the right place.

Light filters through airy archways

Haiku : Revealing His holy.presence.
Censors waft sacred. _
The organ breathes out

Perfect symbol crys- . Resounding breath of God.

tal vision lucid image My arms,

kids drool on canvas two spires,

, reach up.

Rainbow puzzle of chipped glass ;
Paints celestial streets for me.

Squealin’ about pe- _ Wax figures,

can logs insides gurlin’ with — Clay saints,

syrupy Coke. Long trip Intercede.
Twelve permanent padlocked boxes

Monkeys type on | and ushers |

cassettes man eats bugs. . Beg for the salvation ~

. of my faith.
