Hey, taxi!
Rides program
to pull up soon

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

After many months of plan-
ning, a rides program for Davidson
students is nearing completion, or
at least is nearly ready to move from
the drawing board phase to an ac-
tual test phase. The service is ex-
pected to start running sometime
after Spring Break.

Warren Buford, outgoing SGA
president and co-chair of the Rides
Committee, expects that the rides
program will be in operation within
the next six weeks. The planning
and development of this program
involved a task force of five staff
members and three students, as well
_ as co-chairman Bill Felty. Dean
Shandley, who Buford says was
very supportive of the task force,
also assisted in the process.

Although the specifics of the
program are not certain, Buford
hopes that “we can have a skeleton
program within the next weeks...
and develop from that stage.”
Buford hopes that this skeleton pro-
gram would entail a shuttle service

operating three nights-weekly from"

9 p.m. until 2 a.m.

The shuttle would transport stu-
dents to and from “entertainment
zones,” or areas near establishments
often frequented by students, in
Cornelius and neighboring towns.
This program would operate for a
few weeks, at which time the pro-
gram would be evaluated and ad-
justed according to studentresponse
and other factors.

There are no specific “enter-
tainment zones” established yet, and
plans for financing the program are
not yetcomplete. Buford says, “We
think it will be affordable through
the Activities Tax Council, but we
are not sure if students will have to
pay a small fee to use the system.”

“We are not sure who would
drive, how they would be trained,
and whether or not they would be
paid,” Buford says.

Despite these unanswered
questions, Buford is optimistic. “I
think it will work. We can at least
have some shuttle system better than
we have now,” he says. “What
started as a vision now actually
seems possible.... I can see it all
happening.” Buford also says that
these types of systems have to start
small. “We need to buy the vans,
set up a few entertainment zones,
and have lots of trial and error..
Hopefully other students will take

Large voter turnout delays returns

By ALLISON DoLPH
Staff Writer

This past Monday and Tues-
day, elections were held for numer-
ous posts on the SGA, Union Board,
Honor Council, trustee committees,
and several other organizations.

Sophomore John Bell, election
council chairperson, called this past
week’s election “fantastic.”

"Each election gets better and
better. Turnout was exceedingly
high,” he says.

Inthe general election on Mon-
day, more than 56% of the student
population voted (compared with
35% last year).

In the runoff on Tuesday, up-
wards of 46% voted. Freshmen
voted the most, seniors the least.

Bell attributes the higher voter
participation to the tight competi-

tion among the candidates and the
seriousness of the campaigns.

Turnout was so unexpectedly
high that the election committee
workers were counting ballots until
2:30 a.m. on Tuesday.

Because the results were ob-
tained so late, Bell says, announc-
ing the results before the run-off
elections proved difficult. This may
have led to some confusion in
Tuesday’s runoff.

Overall, the election went very

_ smoothly, however. Working on

the elections council under the
chairpersonship of Bell were Paul
Dryden, Margaret Hoover, and
Kirsten Recknagel.

In the future, the committee
hopes to facilitate and expedite the
counting of votes by borrowing
polling booths from Davidson City
Hall.

Three elections

Town forcing four students out of 507 Concord

NARESH NAGELLA

News Editor

On Friday, the students at the
“507 Concord” dorm learned that
what they thought would be semes-
ter long dwellings would be much
more temporary.

The Davidson Town Council
voted to enforce an ordinance that
states that no more than four people

of any organization can live in the
same house. Neighbors of the dorm,
many of whom are college staff
members, asked the council to re-
move the students.

No one informed the students
of the meeting or the action taking
place.

Many people view the law as
one intended to discourage off-cam-
pus residence fraternities or sorori-

ties.

However, the Residence Life
Office and the students at the house
were surprised to learn it would
take effect for short-term housing
like the make-shift dorm.

Most staff members viewed the
move as one that would discourage
future temporary housing in or
around the town.

The actual affect on the house

will be that four of the eight stu-
dents living there will be forced to
move in order to obey the ordi-
nance.

Junior resident Nathan Raley
says, “It is discouraging that four of
us have to leave. I wish the whole
Situation could have been worked
out in a better way.”
