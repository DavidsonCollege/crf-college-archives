FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1954.

PAGE THREE

It’s football time
again, and Davidson’s
spring prictice.wrsion
got under way down
Richardson Field last
Tuesday afternoon.
& Coach Bill Dole and his
4 staff have already got
the heavy pads on the
8 boys, and it looks like
it’s going to be a hard
session that is going to
‘pay off in touchdowns
next fall. With the
f added strength of the
freshman _ squad,
chances for the 1954
season are looking
much brighter. Witl some noticeable changes on the schedule
for next fall, Davidson’s chances for a winning season look
about the best in the past five years, and the season’s record
should soar far above last year’s showing. It seems certain that
the freshmen of 1954 will have something to cheer about.

These spring practices, often criticized by some groups,
are really necessary to give the boys an early chance to work
together as a unit. With a ruling of the Southern Conference
banning all pre-season practice prior to September 1, some
sort of spring practice is almost essential if a well-rounded

team is to be molded by opening game time.

Seems that the athletic committee has finally selected

the way in which D.C. sport fortunes will move for a while] 7" |

at least. After several years of following a “middle-of-the-
road” policy that has proven very unsatisfactory, the com-
mittee felt that some sort of positive action had to be taken.
There were, of course, several choices from which the com-
mittee had to choose. They could decide on “big-time foot-
ball” and keep up with the trend of modern football factories,
or they could drop intercollegiate football in favor of intra-
mural sports. The committee made the choice that would make
for a continuance of intercollegiate football but on a smaller
scale. It is not a complete de-emphasis program, but it is cer-
tainly below the standards of past years.

Such powerhouses as Georgia Tech and Harvard have
been dropped from the schedule, along with N.C. State and
Richmond. There is no sense in kidding ourselves that we
gained anything except money in that 53-0 loss to Tech last
season, and these teams would continue to be cripplers on
the Davidson schedule.

Another move the committee made as part of the new
program is the abolishment of the post of a paid athletic pub-
licity director. Students will handle the job from now on. The
absence of'a full-time director who handles correspondence
with other schools, and who calculates school athletic records
will be felt much more than the officials realize, and this is a
move on which we cannot honestly agree with the committee.

~ All of you sports fans have a series of treats coming up
this spring. Starting with the Southeastern United States
Volleyball Tournament, Davidson will be the site of five major
athletic tourneys.The tournament schedule will be climaxed on
June 7-12, when the Southern Junior Boys and Tennis Tourna-
ment, which is nationally famous, will be held on the local
courts. You will hear more about these tournaments as the
schedule progresses, with dates being given well in advance.

Revenge Minded Frosh
Hit Kannapolis Quintet

By JOHN HOLSHOUSER

On Saturday night the freshman quint will play host to
the Kannapolis “Y,” and will be seeking revenge on the “Y”
for handing them their first defeat earlier in the season by
the score of 52-46. The Kittens have a good chance to over-
come this six-point margin on their home court, and with the
experience gained since then they should give Kannapolis a
hot scrap.
The Davidson Wildkittens hand-

day layoff for exams, and they also
had their hands full with the

ed Coach Paul Scott a win in
his first game since he took over
the reigns of the frosh basketball
team by defeating a hustling
O'Dell squad 41-38 in a preliminary
to the Davidson-College of Charles-
ton game here Saturday night.
Coach Scott replaced Tom Fetzer
who has accepted a coaching posi-
tion at Furman University. The
Kittens were noticeably off in the
shooting department after the ten-

flashy O'Dell team which boasted
a 17-0 record going into the con-
test. Gaylord Walker was high
scorer for the freshmen with 11

points, and Richard Weeks was
second high with 10.

Charlotte College, Gardner-Webb
and Pfeiffer complete the sched-
ule for this season for the fresh-
men.

CHARLIE MURRAY
One of the finest wrestlers to wear the Davidson colors in
recent years, Chartie has proved to be hard to beat. He will lead
the grapplers as they meet Citadel here next Friday,

Wildcat Wrestlers Idle
After Loss To State

After taking their worst defeat of the season at the hands
of a hustling North Carolina State wrestling team on Tues-
day night, Davidson’s Wildcat grapplers remain idle until next
Friday when they tangle with The Citadel’s Bulldogs on the
local mats in an afternoon meet.

The Cats dropped to State by
19-10 as sensational Charlie Mur-
ray added another to his string of
victories as he pinned his man.

Dave Burns downed his opponent
by a decision while Henry Faison
fought to a draw to score the Cats’
other five points:

The frosh wrestlers made a fine
showing as they downed State's
yearlings by a sizeable 22-11 count.
The freshmen show plenty of
hustle and skill and Coach Parker
expects them to be a great help
to the team next season when they
become eligible for varsity com-
petition.

The Cats will remain at home
for the remainder of their regular
season encounters as they meet
The Citadel, Washington and Lee
and VPI on the local mats. They
close out regular activities on
February 22 before the conference
meet action.

with the Bulldogs who will travel
to the local pool next Friday, The
Cats meet South Carolina and Wof-
ford in a triangular affair in Co-
lumbia next Tuesday.

freshman swimmers on doing a3
swell job this season, winning two
out of their three meets, and he
believes they will have an even
chance to win the two remaining
teams they meet.

freshman medley relay team and
the 400-yard free style relay team

ming meet at VPI in Blacksburg,

breast-stroker, has cut 8&6 seconds
off his time in the 200-yard breast-
stroke in the last two weeks. Also
Al Ormond and Bob Patton have
been improving consistently for
the last three weeks.

The varsity team includes: Bo
Abernathy, Bill Buck, Archie
Joyner, Bud Montgomery, Steve

‘Betas, ATO’s

Pace Greeks

As the interfraternity teams got
back into action after the exam
break, some fast high-scoring
games marked the action. The
ATO’s and the Betas remained un-
defeated to top the league as the
formerly undefeated Phi Gams
dropped two and lost their top
slot rating.

The Pikas took a tight hold on
third place as they established
themselves as the highest scoring
club in the league. Their 51 points
per game average is tops in the
averages. The Kappa Sigs follow
in fourth place, having not played
as many games as the Pikas
through Wednesday.

The top-ranking Betas took the
season’s high-scoring honors for a
single game as they walloped the
Sig Eps 62-39.

Kappa Sig’s Corky Clark con-
tinues to be the league's big gun
as he holds a 19-point average in
his first three games. Lanky Lind-
ley Beardsley, the Pika sparkplug,
is a close second with an 18-point
per game average, while ATO’s
Murray Page has hit for 16.5 in
his first four games. Beardsley has
scored the most number of points
with a 71-point total.

The results of the week’s action
are following,

Beta 53; Phi Gam 27
The top-ranking Betas rolled
over the previously unbeaten Phi
Gams after the exam layoff by a
63 to 27 count. John McLaughlin
hit for 13 to pace the Beta victory,
while the Phi Gams had trouble

getting their attack rolling.

Sigma Chi 52; KA 49

The Sigma Chis won a close ball
game from the KAs by the score
of 52 to 49. Tom Shaw led the
fast-breaking Sigma Chi attack
with a total of 21 points. Perrin
Anderson added 18. Fof the KAs,
Hall and Larry McIntosh sparked
the scoring with 15 and 12 points
respectively.

Pike S9; Pi Kepp 32

The Pikas ran away with the
Pi Kapps in the third quarter and
coasted to a 59 to 32 victory. With
big Lindley Beardsley dropping in
20 points and Tom Owen and John
Handley doing the ball handling,
the Pikas took an early lead and
never were headed after the first
quarter. Charlie Robinson collected
8 points.

Bete 62; SAE 39

The Betas dropped in 62 points
while holding the SPEs to 39 to
gather their fourth victory. Bill

Important Encounter
For Hot-Cold Wildcats

Davidson’s Varsity basketball team meets VMI here to-
morrow night in a game that will see the Wildcats setting
their sights on.a spot in the Southern Conference tournament.
The Davidson club is now occupying fifth place in the
conference standings with only three conference opponents

remaining on the schedule.

If the Cats are able to take the
Cadets in hand tomorrow night,
they should continue to hold their
fifth place standing, since only
Citadel and Furman remain in the
way after tomorrow's game, and
Davidson will be heavily favored
to beat the Citadel. A win over
VMI will almost assure the Cats
that they will be in the vicinity of
Morgantown, West Virginia, when
tourney time rolls around,

Southern Clubs High-Ranked

If the Wildcats do make it to
the tournament, they will be
traveling in the company of a
select group of basketball teams.
George Washington, who is cur-
rently leading the pack in Confer-
ence games, is rated this week as
the llth best cage team in the
country, according to the Asso-
ciated Press Poll.

Furman, second in conference
standings, boasts the nation’s lead-
ing scorer, Frank Selvy, who re-
cently broke the all-time three-
year scoring mark for an individ-

ual player.
Cats Split Two

Since the ten-day lay-off, tak-
en during the exam period, the
Wildcats have split two decisions.
Last Saturday night, the cagers
met the College of Charleston and
emerged the victors by a wide
margin. This was the fifth victory
of the season for Davidson.

Then last Tuesday night, the
Wildcats traveled to Columbia to
meet South Carolina University.
The Gamecocks had lost a 65-56
decision to Davidson earlier in the
season, but Tuesday was their
night. They were red hot, hit-.
ting a very high percentage of
shots in the first half as they
built up a big lead. The last half
saw the two teams play almost
evenly, but the first half lead was
too great, and South Carolina won.

This marked the first time this
season that the Cats had lost to
a club from the Palmetto state in

four games.

FOr more than thirty years we have used
research day in and day out learning about
tobaccos and cigarettes in the public’s interest.

Continuously we and our consultants have
analyzed, experimented with and smoked all
kinds of tobaccos... especially Southern Bright,
Burley, Maryland and Turkish cigarette to-

baccos.

Our own cigarettes and competitive brands
have been submitted to the most exacting
scientific scrutiny including thousands of anal-
yses of millions of pounds of tobaccos.

From all these thousands of analyses, and
other findings reported in the leading technical
journals, our Research Department has found
no reason to believe that the isolation and
elimination of any element native to cigarette
tobaccos today would improve smoking.
