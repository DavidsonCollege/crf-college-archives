FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 1953

Tomorrow afternoon
down on Richardson
Field Davidson’s 1953
track team will open
its season against Roa-
noke. There will be no
crowd on hand and the
event will make no
’ banner headlines in
the Sunday morning
, papers. But  tomor-
‘row’s track meet will

have a special signif-
icance for Pete Whit-
tle, who will be begin-
ning his twentieth sea-
son as coach of the
Wildcat cindermen.
Whittle is something of a curiosity at Davidson, being the
only coach here who can claim a consistently winning record.
As a matter of fact, Pete is presently able to boast 13 winning
seasons as headmaster of track. Yet the engaging Mr. Whittle
seems intent only on getting his boys to do their best and for-
getting about spilt milk.

THE SPORT'S THE THING

After years of being exposed to the elements while giving
instructions to his track or cross country teams, the dean of
the Davidson Coaching staff has a tanned, almost leathery
face like a naval officer who has put in many hours watch on
the bridge of a ship. The passing of time may have put a
few wrinkles in his face, but it has not done anything to the
jauntiness of his step or the quickness of his smile. Not
bothered by any pressure to field a winning team, Whittle has
been able to enjoy life and do the thing which he seems to
love most — making better athletes out of good ones, and try-
ing to make athletes out of the boys who are just out for his
sport.

That Whittle should be able to tell his boys how it should
be done, no one can deny. Pete entered Davidson in 1926,

McKee’s Club Meets
Powerful Dartmouth
On Davidson Courts

By MOODY SMITH
Davidson’s tennis team will
see action for the fifth time
this week when they collide
with Dartmouth’s racquet-
swingers on the local courts
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.
The Dartmouth squad is making
a swing through the South as many
of the stronger northern tennis
teams do each year. The Northern-
ers are reputed to be fairly strong,
despite the 9-0 shellacking they re-
cently absorbed at the hands of
Presbyterian, one of the stronger
college teams in this area.
Played Eight Matches
At press time scores from only
six of the eight matches that the

Cats have played this season were

available. The remaining two
matches were Thursday and today

| with Harvard and Sewanee respec-

tively. Cy

On their holiday swing through
the south the Cats met with con-
siderable success, whitewashing
Jacksonville State Teachers Col-
lege, the University of Alabama,
and Mercer University all by scores
of 9-0.

At the Pensacola Naval Air Sta-
tion the Cats ran into much stiffer
opposition, but managed to eke out
a 5-4 victory.

There they ran into an old
enemy in the person of one Frank
Spears, who for the past three
years was the mainstay of the P.C.
team. Spears defeated Lacy Kees-
ler in the number one singles
match. Pensacola also won the
two and three singles, but David-
son came back to take the last
three singles matches and two of
the doubles matches to win.

Luck Turns

Last Monday afternoon, however,
luck began to take a decided turn
for the worse against Coach Dick
McKee’s team. On Monday they
were soundly trounced by Michi-
gan State, and Wednesday saw
them bowing in defeat to a re-
venge-hungry Harvard team that
had nét won a match on the David-

scores were 8-1 and 5-4 respective-

CINDERMEN RUN
ROANOKE HERE IN
SEASON OPENER

By JACK BFIRD

Coach Whittle’s runners open
their outdoor track season this
Saturday afternoon at 1:30 on the
home grounds when they face a
good Roanoke College team. The
Virginia opponent has one of its
best teams in recent years and is
expected to put up a tough fight in
the Wildcats opener. In the recent
Southern Conference Indoor Meet
at Raleigh the Virginian’s showed
up very well and were close to the
top in the final point total.

This season the Cats don’t have
as well a balanced or experienced
team as they have in the past, but
after this meet more information
can be gathered as to future pros-
pects.

Several Lettermen

Returning veterans from last
year's team are Frank Mitchener in
the 100 and 220, Bill Shipley and
J. V. Howell in the 440, Captain
Bob Henry in the 880, Bill Russell
and Homer Sparks in the mile,
Floyd Feeney in the two mile, Roy
White in the hurdles and broad
jump, Bob Poston in the pole
vault, and Don Lazenby in the
discus and shot put. These season-
ed men probably will be the back-

bone of this year’s team, however, |

several new comers may very well
break into the spot light.

pants in the opener:

(Continued On Page Four)

Although Coach Clements hasn’t
decided definitely on his starting
lineup it will probably run about
the same as in the two previous
games. Clements has shifted his
lineup frequently, hoping to hit
on the right combination. In their
first two appearances of the season,
the Cats come out on the short
end of 11-2 and 16-7 scores against
Duke and Williams.

The best play thus far has cen-
tered around some of the returning
stalwarts from last year’s club and
a fine group of freshman infield-
ers. Although he went hitless
against Duke left fielder Fred
Stowe came through with two hits
against Williams and played well
in the field.

Whiz Going Great

Another of the good returning
lettermen from last year’s squad
is first sacker Arnold “Whiz” Whis-
nant who has rapped out two hits

in each of the games to date.

“Whiz” is a good fielder and has
turned flawless performances
around the initial sack.

Possibly the most outstanding
and the most promising of the
freshman prospects is Billy Morris
who has really done a fine job at
third. Bill has made some excellent
plays at “the hot corner” and needs
only a little experience to make

one of the finest fielding third
sackers in the league.

Frosh Look Good

Two other promising freshmen,
both infielders, are Buzzy Holt and
Jim Teeter. Both these boys looked
good in the two games thus far and
Coach Clements has great hopes
for this shortstop-second base com-
bo.

Another keystone combination
which will see a lot more action

before the season is over js that
of Max Devane and Johnny Gray.
Gray's arm is just getting back its
normal strength after the football
injury sustained last fall and when
its completely well Johnny will see
plenty of action.

Thus far the pitching problem
has been Clements’ biggest worry
as the hurlers have not hit their
stride as yet. Returning letterman
Jimmy Smith was ineffective
against Duke last Saturday as was
Johnny Smith. Ish Bennett and
Roger Little have turned the best
performances before they tired.
Corky Burdette is one of the most
promising of the freshmen hurlers,
but he too had trouble finding
the range.
