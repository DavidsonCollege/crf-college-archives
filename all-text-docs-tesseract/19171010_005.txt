STATEMENT REGARDING
Y. M. C. A. HANDBOOK

‘The external appearance of the Hand-
book this year will probably be a disup-
pointment to the upperclassmen, who
have been accustomed to receiving the
leather bound book of former years. But
it is the expensive binding of last year’s
book (with an insufficient number of
advertisements to balance the cost, which
put the Y. M. C. A. $50 in debt) that
forces us to resort to the use of the less
expensive leatherette binding this year.
It must be acknowledged that this is a
hackward step, but we offer the booklet
without apology. It is the desire of the
Y. M. C. A. cabinet that such a binding
be used. “Economy” is the watchword
of the nation now ; this binding gives the
Y. M. C. A. an opportunity to get out
of debt, and be in a position to return to
the former high-grade binding.

Thru the very valuable assistance of
H. T. Lilly, editor, and R. H. Stone,
assistant manager, in soliciting advertise-
iments, and the donation of J. L. Fowle.
this edition of the Handbook wil! be
practically self-supporting.

Even tho the management has _ not
come up to the former standard, the
editor has surpassed it. He has, within
a very short tirse, combined faithful ef-
fort with new and original ideas to com-
pile a booklet that will be a credit to the
the Y. M. C. A.. for I do not believe it
has been surpassed in quality.

The book was turned over to the
printers October 1, and work on it was
begun immediately. They report that
the proof sheets will be ready in a short
time, and that the book will be out -very
Soon afterwards. To further keep down
expenses very few extra copies will be
printed this time. These will be for
sale at 25 cents per copy; those desiring
additional copies will please hand in
their names. O. J. Tries, Jr., Mer.
