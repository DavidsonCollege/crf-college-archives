Historic season ends in conference semis

By STEPHEN J. HALLIDAY
Senior Staff Writer

With a 17-10 record (14-6 SoCon), the
women’s basketball team headed into the
conference tournament in Chattanooga, TN,

as the second seed behind powerhouse UT ~

Chattanooga.

The ’Cats’ first game was in the quarterfi-
nals against the seven seed, College of
Charleston. The game started slowly, as the
*Cats played solid defense but failed to hit
their shots and turned the ball over frequent-
ly. Davidson shot just 30 percent from the
floor in the period but held Charleston to an
abysmal 23 percent.

A Katie Hamilton ’07 three at the end of
the half put the ’Cats up 20-14 going into the
intermission.

In the second half, however, the ’Cats
caught fire. Hamilton, who scored 22 points
in the second period alone, led the offensive
barrage for Davidson, and the combination
of offensive and defensive efficiency
allowed the ’Cats to jump out to a quick lead
and cruise to a 68-48 win.

Hamilton finished the game with 27 points
and six rebounds, and guard Tia Washington
°07 added 14 points and eight rebounds.
Captain Emily Callahan ’05 said of the play
of Hamilton and Washington, “[Hamilton]
has been a great leader through her play, and
[Washington] has been great at telling us
what to do, motivating us, and has done a ter-
rific job the entire season of what needs to be
done on the floor.”

With the win, Davidson advanced to the
tournament semifinals against Western
Carolina. Just as importantly, top seed and
conference bully Chattanooga fell in the
opposite side of the bracket against ETSU,
meaning the field was wide open for
Davidson to make a run at the SoCon title.

Davidson had mixed results against
Western earlier in the year, however, as the
*Cats were drilled in Cullowhee, 74-56,
before they pulled out a tense 65-63 win at
home on two last-second Jessica Mitchell
°07 free throws.

The Catamounts, led by all-conference

center Jennifer Gardner, again proved a very
tough match-up for the ’Cats, as their size

under the glass routinely led to offensive .

rebounds, second-
chance points, and
defensive presssure.

Davidson _strug-
gled. to solve
Western’s size early
in the semifinal
game, as the ’Cats
hobbled to a seven-
point deficit at inter- {
mission after the
Catamounts pulled
down 13 offensive |
rebounds that led to
13. second-chance
points in the first
frame.

Western i regis- |
tered only four more
offensive rebounds
in the second half,
and the Wildcats
chipped away at the
deficit despite hit-
ting on just 35 per-
cent of their
attempts in the final
frame.

A three-pointer by -
Danielle Hemerka
°08 less than 10
minutes into the
second frame put
the Wildats up 42-41, their first lead since
the opening minutes, and a Washington lay-
up with 3:38 to play put Davidson up 53-48.

With Hamilton and Janell Crayton ’06 in
foul trouble, however, the ’Cats turned the
ball over several times in the final minutes
and failed to convert from the field and at the
line line as Western jumped back out to a 56-
53 lead with under a minute to play.

A game-tying try from beyond the arc by
Hamilton was no good, and Western then
iced the victory by going 3-4 from the line in
the final minute. Mitchell hit a three from
nearly 40 feet as time expired, but the ’Cats

fell just short in the 59-58 loss.
Crayton led the team in scoring with 14
points, while Hemerka added 10 points and

Western has proved to be ’Cats’ tourney bugaboo after
eliminating Davidson the past two years in the tourney.

seven boards. Hamilton and Washington
struggled from the field, going a combined
5-21 and scoring nine and seven points,
respectively. ;

Despite the loss, the ’Cats’ season was an
undeniable success, as Davidson set a school
record for conference wins and earned the
second seed in the SoCon tournament for
only the second time in school history.

The team is losing only one senior,
Callahan, and though her leadership will cer-
tainly be missed, the team will return to the
hardwood with high expectations next
November.

_ UNCG did not baol “niin Ws ss how-
ever, as the Spaitans used clutch shooting
from the free-throw link to pull back out to a
three-point lead with 1:31 to go. McKillop
after thé game suggested that UNCG’s con-
stant trips to the line in the closing minutes
may have also caused Davidson to tighten
up, as each free throw opportunity stopped
the clock and forced Davidson players to
begin to think instead of just play.

The ’Cats came back to tie the game on a
Winters reverse lay-up with a minute to play,
but UNCG responded with a three-pointer to
put the ’Cats dqwn three yet again.

Two Logan Kosmalski ’05 free throws on
the ensuing possession cut the lead to one,
but the Spartans hit another jumper that put
the ’Cats out for good. Kosmalski’s game-
tying attempt from beyond the arc was short,
ending Davidson’s hopes of a storybook
postseason run.

Instead, the best team in the Southern
Conference all year had to go home because
it failed in the one game that actually mat-
tered.

In a recent interview on ESPN’s College
GameNight, Coach McKillop explained,
“We came into the tournament knowing the
rules of engagement. It’s a game of Russian
roulette.”

But is it a necessary game of roulette?

While the common notion is that mid- _
majors must win their tournaments to
advance to the Big Dance, the Ivy League
does not have a conference tournament, and
therefore the regular season champion
receives the automatic NCAA bid. This
places a premium on sustained success
instead of the bounces of the basketball in
early March and allows the conference-to
send its best representative instead of the
team on a small winning streak.

Perhaps the rising stock of mid-majors
around the country will put pressure on con-
ferences to create a better way to select their
conference representative, but the 2004-05
Wildcats will have to be content with a per-
fect regular season, an NIT appearance, and
a place in the annals of March Madness.
