REVIEW OF LITERARY
SOCIETY WORK OF YEAR

PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY.

The Phi. Society began the year un-
der the: guidance of J. A. Thames as
president. The progress of the society
was somewhat hampered by the fact that
no new members were taken in this
term; the Junior society having come
into existence. Nevertheless it was a
very successful term. It was during this
term that D. M. Chalmers. ’20. won
the Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medal.
Furthermore the Phi’s have two Senior
“Reps” to their credit in the persons of
J. A. Thames and J. L. Fowle.

J. L. Fowle succeeded next to the
presiding chair and carried thru a term
filled with’ important events. It was
during this term that, due to R. E. Mc-
Clure’s untiring efforts, the Phi Society
was able to determine that it had 66
men in the service of the country, in tes-

_ timony of which there is now a service
flag in the hall.

Again the Phi's furnished two men
to the debating teams representing Da-
vidson College in intercollegiate debates,
and both of the alternates.

The last term was in charge of J. W.
Clark, and the following events trans-
pired: The Fresh-Soph debating team
of the Phi Society overcame a similar
team from the Eumenean Society, at
which time D. M. Chalmers came off
winner of the debater’s medal among the
Phi men. Again the Junior-Senior de-
bating team of the Phi’s defeated the
Junior-Senior team of the Eumenean.
W. M. Currie winning the Philan-
thropic Junior-Senior debater’s medal.
this being the third time consecutively
that the Phi’s have triumphed in the Ju-
nior-Senior debate... The three represen-
tatives are to be doubly honored in bring-
ing the loving cup to the society.

O. P. Hart was adjudged to have won
‘the intra-society essay contest by a mas-
terly essay.

EUMENEAN SOCIETY.

The college year just closing has been
a very successful one for the Eumenean
Literary Society. En the fall term, the
meetings were interrupted for a time be-
cause the hall was being repaired, but in
the spring the meetings have been reeu-
lar and the work has been exceptionalls
good. The Eumenean Society lost to
the Philanthropic Society both the Fresh-
Soph and Junior-Senior debates; but the
loss of the last was probably due to the
fact that its best debating talent was on
the inter-collegiate debating teams.

Of the five speakers in the inter-col-
legiate debates, three were Eumenean
men.

Up to the: present time, four medals
have been awarded—the Fresh improve-
ment medal, to J. R. Boulware, Tr.;
the Fresh-Soph debater’s medal, to Wm.
Love: the Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medal,
to W. B. Sullivan; the Junior-Senior de-
bater’s medal, to L. M. Thomas.

The society hall has been improved
during the present year by the installa-
tion of a handsome indirect lighting sys-
tem, and the walls have been calcimined.
A committee is now compiling a list of
former members of the Eumenean So-
ciety now in service, and a service flag
will be secured as soon as this work is
complete.
