Town meeting focuses on residence life

Students tell RLO what’s up

By Brooke BAGWELL
Staff Writer

The SGA held its second town
meeting on Thursday night to dis-
cuss the issue of residence life.
Student co-chairs of the Student
Advisor Committee to the Resi-
dence Life Office Sara Beth Hamlin
and Dave Derrick, Director of Resi-
dence Life Kurt Holmes, and Di-
rector of Housing Operations
Debbie Young attended the meet-
ing to answer questions and offer
solutions for existing concerns.

The main focus of discussion
centered on the upkeep of resi-
dence halls. Students suggested
areas of improvement relating to
dorm rooms and communal areas,
and the RLO representatives re-
lated the college’s plans to address
the issue.

Pest control was an issue,
namely the presence of ants indorm
rooms. Holmes noted that Caro-
lina Pest Control exterminates
twice a year for the College but
said students could alleviate the
problem with the proper contain-

ment of food and heavy fragrance
to prevent insect infestation.

Another big issue was the
maintenance of hall bathrooms.
Students registered complaints
about the lack of shower curtains
and bathroom stall doors in some
bathrooms and spoke of the poor
quality of the campus toilet paper.
Young indicated that the college
was currently investigating bath-
room accommodations and formu-
lating the most cost efficient solu-
tions.

Students also touched on the
relationship between the residents
of Martin Court apartments and
the school. Some felt the cleanli-
ness checks were a nuisance.

Yet, Holmes argued the ne-
cessity of such inspections to keep
a check on destructive lifestyles
and prevent damage to school prop-
erty. Holmes similarly mentioned
that student life in the apartments
resembled a landlord-tenant rela-
tionship, involving “real world”

obligations and compliances.
Holmes mentioned that dorm
renovations would be continuing

SGA President Bill Gullan was
pleased with the night’s proceed-
ings and viewed the relatively small
turnout as an indicator that people
are satisfied with residence life.

He commended the RLO and
said he felt confident that the qual-
ity of Thursday night’s meeting
“will generate good levels of
progress.”

Health Center sponsors events for
National Depression Screening

By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Coun-
seling Center will participate in
National Depression Screening
Day to educate people about de-
pression, reduce the stigma sur-
rounding it, and discover individual
cases of it.

Throughout the day on Thurs-
day, October 5, checklists will be
available in the Union to help de-
termine whether you might be suf-
fering from depression. The main
events, though, will take place at

8:00 p.m. in the 900 Room.

First, a panel of students and
faculty will talk about their per-
sonal experiences with depression
— problems with family mem-
bers, close friends, or themselves.

Next, the Counseling Center
will show the movie Ordinary
People, directed by Robert
Redford. It is a film that Davidson
College psychologist DeWitt
Crosby feels is a realistic portrayal
of depression resulting from issues
of survivor guilt.

All students, faculty, and staff
are welcome to attend any or all of

the activities. Psychologists will
be on-hand to administer private
Screenings to, as Crosby says, an-
swer the question of, “Am I just
sad and blue, or am I really de-
pressed?”

There will also be forms avail-
able for those who wish to take
them home to fill out and return
later to the counseling center for a
private screening.

Crosby says that it is impor-
tant for people who may be de-
pressed to seek guidance because
most cases of depression can be
treated.

What was happening in 1924?

Seventy-one years ago, in
1924, 3,000 new bleachers were

_ added to Richardson Field for that

year’s football season. These seats
were added to allow enthusiastic
Davidson supporters.to watch he
Wildcat’s prowess on the field.

saw a wonderful season for the
team; the 7-2-1 record included a
5-0 start, victories over Wofford,
Richmond, and Clemson, and a tie
with NC State. The only two losses
that year were to Furman and UNC.
This was the most successful team
since 1917.

Enrollment started to boost in
1945 with the admission of 208
new freshman. Register F. W.
Henewald was pleased that the
number “approached pre-war en-

tober 15 so the College could par-
ticipate in a nationwide Vietnam
Moratorium.

This was a moratorium on
business as usual which urged pub-
lic awareness of the war. The day
included an outside speaker, fac-
ulty forum, and an evening wor-
ship service.

Inthe not so distant past, 1988,
strong winds and high waves

A different war, this time Viet-
nam, rocked the students in 1969.

Also in that week of 1988,
something happened that we can
all relate to today. The infamous
U.S. News & World Report
rankings listed Davidson as 20th, a
drop of five places from the previ-
ous year.
