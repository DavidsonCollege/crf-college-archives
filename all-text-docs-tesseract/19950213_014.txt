Harwood’s shot drops ASU

Men's basketball snaps three-game skid

Just when the men’s basket-
ball team needed a patch-up job,
Quinn Harwood stepped up and
righted Davidson’s sinking ship.

MEN'S
BASKETBALL
Harwood nailed a three-
pointer with four seconds left Sat-
urday to give the Wildcats a 76-75
win at Appalachian State to break
the team’s three-game. losing
streak, its longest skid in two years.
With the win, Davidson
popped back into contention in the
Northern Division of the Southern
Conference after coming danger-
ously close to slipping into the

lower ranks.

At 5-4 in the conference,
Davidson remained tied for sec-
ond in the division, just one game
behind East Tennessee State. To-
night the Buccaneers come into
Belk Arena for a huge conference
match-up that could go a long way
in determining tournament
seedings.

With a win tonight, Davidson
would basically be back in first
place, as they would have the tie-
breaking advantage over the Buc-
caneers with two head-to-head
wins. The Wildcats beat ETSU in
Johnson City, Tenn., 81-75 on Jan.
14.

Saturday, Harwood found
himself open on the right wing to
drain the shot after coming off
through the back screen on the
baseline. As he let it fly, “It felt

good,” he said, “You never know
that it will be good, but I knew it
had a real good chance to go in.”

Harwood’s shot capped a
game. in which Davidson seemed
on the verge of breaking open sev-
eral times, a game in which the
Wildcats came oh-so-close to los-
ing and a game that finished witha
wild final 20 seconds.

With the Mountaineers ahead
74-71, Brandon Williams missed a
shot in the lane and fouled ASU
star Chad McClendon on the re-

‘bound with 18 seconds left.

McClendon hit one of two free
throws for a four-point margin.
The Wildcats came rightdown
the floor, and Jeff Anderson nailed
a layup. Following a Davidson
timeout, William Cook had trouble

with win

On Saturday afternoon, the
Davidson men’s rugby team en-
joyed the luxury of a moist field
and good weather and used the
elements on its way to a 56-7 rout
of Southwest Virginia Community
College.

RUGBY

In this lopsided win, coming
two weeks after a preseason vic-
tory over arch-rival UNCC, the
Wildcats showcased the results of
some tough offseason training.

Newcomer Will Cowan
played smart and well, while sopho-
mores Will Baldwin, Thayer Long
and Chris Smith helped the scrum
with aggressive defense and tanta-
lizing force. As usual, Graham
Powell and Frank Killian kept the
opposition down with hard hitting
and clutch passes. Freshman Hank
Ackerman scored the first try and
senior John Walsh also added a
single try.

But on this day, four seniors
showed some of their talents that
have made them stars of the team.
Team captain Simon Priestly
scored acareer-high 31 points, with
three tries and eight successful
point-after kicks.

Jeremy Potter also had a hat
trick, scoring one try by soaring
over three defenders to dive on the
ball in the try zone.

If you ever pass by the foot-
ball weight room late at night and
hear the clang of metal plates from
within, don’t worry.

It’s not a stowaway trying to
hide out in the room and escape
the attention of Baker officials.

And it’s probably not a bur-
glar, although the person inside
could probably thwart any bur-
glar.

That’s senior Bill Gabriel in-
side the room, training hard for
his next weightlifting competition.

Currently, he’s fifth in the
nation in his 83 kg weight class,
competing against others who
don’t alsohave the other demands
of Davidson to deal with.

Olympic-style weightlifting,
as Gabriel is quick to point out, is
not the same as the powerlifting
version of the sport that most of us
are familiar with. Olympic lifters
throw the weight over their heads
in two ways: the clean and jerk
and the snatch.

Unlike powerlifting, “the
sport requires a combination of
strength, coordination and fi-
nesse,” Gabriel says. He also
stresses that “there is a large men-
tal component involved. ... I can
see it as a form of expression,
definitely.”

Like all sports that require
highly-tuned skills, “being able to
do what you see in your mind is
important,” Gabriel says.

The senior from Costa Mesa,
Calif., started lifting in high school
to strengthen himself for other
sports. His coach in high school
suggested he try competitive lift-
ing. Since then, he has spent four
summers training at the Olympic

Brandon-Clarke

Training Center in Colorado
Springs, Colo.

He placed second at the Colle-
giate Championships in 1993 and
‘94. Last year, he placed fifth in
the Senior Nationals and second at
the Olympic Festival in the sum-
mer.

Now, his eyes are set on the
‘96 Nationals.

At the Nationals, Gabriel is
shooting forthe top three. The sport
is dictated mostly by training, so
there are usually very few sur-
prises in competition.

“It’s a skill you cultivate over
time,” Gabriel says. In a sport
where the hardest workers excel,
Gabriel is no exception.

Gabriel trains about 20 hours
aweek. His exercises are specific,
performing ‘‘a lot of squats and a

lot of exercises that simulate the
pull and jerk motions,” he says.

Along with the hours of train-
ing, he says that it is important to
get many calories each day to
help the recuperation process.

As graduation looms on the
horizon, Gabriel hesitantly says
that the ‘96 Nationals may be the
end of the line in terms of highly
competitive lifting.

But that doesn’t mean Gabriel
will be through with the sport. He
finds lifting mind-clearing and
will probably lift in some capac-
ity throughout his life.

“It doesn’t take much,” he
says. “Just a bar.”

He says that the Olympic-
lifting style is starting to be used

This weekend, the Wildcats’
sailing team hosted the first annual.
Davidson Spring Open Regatta.
Michigan and UNC-Wilmington
each entered two crews to compete
for the Wildcat Perpetual Trophy.

SAILING

Saturday’s racing was held in
very light and shifty conditions,
consequently everyone was up and
down except Dave Saudek and
Brice Ivy who finished the day in
first with a second and two third
places.

Racing on Saturday ended
early when everyone decided to go
on to other activities rather then
wait for wind.

Sunday turned out much bet-
ter. Although the wind was still
pretty inconsistent, there was
enough to get off four races.
Davidson swept first through third
places overall due to strong team
finishes on Sunday.

Next weekend, the team will
go to the Charleston Spring Inter-
sectional Regatta.

Davidson's team of Graham
Ernst and Lara Onkey finished in
first place with alow score of 17.25
for the seven races, while Andrew
Cole and Thu Thieu were second
at 18.25. Also for the Wildcats,
Dave Saudek and Brice Ivey took
third with 22.75 points.
