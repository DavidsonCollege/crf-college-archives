Band Three

Crunch Time

Days debuts Some say Davidson ranks #2 to
Stanford for demanding
undergraduate workload.
Others say that: is a myth.

By Tom Bavis
About 70 people congregated
in the 900 room Thursday evening

to witness the birth of the band:

Three Days. The band’s five mem:

bers—sophomore Karl Ruch and ~
freshme Ravi Jain; Will Nolen, .

Andy Morris, and Andrew
OQ’ Delihave been playing to-
gether for several weeks but had
never played before a large audi-
ence, Flyers, distributed by the
devoted band members, appeared

everywhere in the days preceding .

the show, drawing a substantial
audience for the debut.

The crowd heard an hour of
Christian-based pop that was as
spirited as itwas crude. The group
rarely kept the same line-up for
more than two songs, intermin-
gling full rock, pop, and reggae
arrangements with solos.

Each member of Three Days
showed off his multi-instrumen-
talism. Karl Ruch, normally the
provider of dazzling drum beats,
tried his hand at a piano ballad as
his band mates joined the audi-
ence. Guitarist Ravi Jain worked
the crowd into a frenzy with a pan

flute solo during one uplifting -

rocker. An excellent guitar instru-
mental earned Andrew O’ Dell a
standing~ovation:~ Keyboardist/
‘ vocalist/percussionist Andy Morris
lapsed into the spoken word (liter-
ally) as he delivered a short ser-
mon during a break. He ended, “If
you want to talk about God or
about having faith, feel free to talk
to any one of us; because we feel
we have the answer.”

Along with the successful de-
but and a satisfied crowd lurked
some obvious weaknesses. Tech-
nical woes delayed the show’s be-
ginning and occasionally appeared
in mid-song. Some songs needed
more practice. A couple songs,
though well intentioned, lacked the
musical spunk and lyrical intensity
characteristic of spiritual songs by
the Indigo Girls (“Closer to Fine”)
and some similar-sounding Chris-
tian groups like The Choir. Fortu-
nately for Three Days, a band still
in its embryonic stages, the rough
edges could definitely be erased
with time.

By Yvette Pita ,
“I have so much: Work this

week. I’ve got a test dn Wednes-

day, three problem sets due on
Thursday, and a term paper due
Friday.”

“That’s nothing. I have to
tread 675 pages by Tuesday, finish
three papers by Thursday, and I
have two tests on Friday.”

Sound familiar?

Davidson students are con-
stantly complaining about their
workload. Are we justified in say-
ing that our professors assign too
much work?

Some students claim that
Davidson has the second hardest
workload in the country (behind
Stanford); however, I searched
every college ranking in US News
& World Report since 1988 and
found nothing to verify that asser-
tion.

Wesley Davis, a’senior politi-
cal science major, believes that
claim is a rumor. “I went on a
France trip with students trom
Swarthmore who said their
workload was second behind
Yale’s,” he said.

Re gardless of our ranking, stu-
dents still seem overwhelmed by
their work. Megan Fisher, a junior
psychology major, believes that
“the stress level at this school is
unhealthy. There are a lot of ac-
tivities around campus that I’d like
to participate in, but I just don’t
have the time.”

Other students think that we
should expect large amounts of
work. Davis states, “This. is. a
really good school. You’ve got to
take the amount of work with a

grain of salt because we’ll all get a’

payback later.” Rafael Candelario,
asenior history major, agrees, “The
people hiring know this school is
challenging. I’m glad it’s tough.
That’s how I got my job.”
According to Davis, the

workload at Davidson can. be: ‘Te-
ally strenuous, butastudent’ sstress
level depends on the courses he or
she takes,

Dr. Jeremiah Putnam, the head
of the Pre-medical program feels
that, although he has not heard
many complaints from students,
those enrolled in the pre-med pro-
gram “may feel added stress due to
the various outside requirements
demanded by medical schools.”

Additionally, Dr. Verna Case,
the head of the biology depart-
ment, believes that science stu-
dents, in general, may feel addi-
tional pressure because they must

attend lectures as well as labs.

However, she finds the biology
curriculum at Davidson to be no
different from that of other schools.

Yet many believe that our col-
lege is more difficult than others
with equal or better reputations.
Mark Little, a senior biology ma-
jor, feels that “because of the fact
that we have smaller classes, the
teachers expect more. Sometimes
people have conflicts with work in
different classes that may not get
noticed in other schools.”

Dr. Alberto Hernandez, a
Spanish professor, states, “At big-
ger institutions, students can hide
in the anonymity of a big class-
room, and not feel guilty that they
haven’t studied for class.”

Fisher adds, “I have friends at
Princeton who don’tdo muchwork.
I think that some schools that are
harder tobe accepted into are easier
once you get in.”

Patrick “Ed” Thiedeman, a
senior studio art major, believes
the work at Davidson is much more
difficult than that at other institu-
tions: “I talk to my friends at state
schools, and they don’t do diddly.”

Chris Wyrick, a junior studio
art major, admits that the work at
Davidson is definitely more diffi-
cult than at other schools, but he

feels that all students here are ca-
pable of doing it. “I think a lot of
people waste a lot of time here,” he
said.

Some attribute being over-
whelmed to the fact that they were

recently abroad. “Being away from °

the Davidson academic load makes
it hard to come back here,” says
Fisher. “Once you see what’s out
there, it’s hard to get motivated to
do schoolwork again.”

Some feel that perhaps the
workload at Davidson has in-
creased throughout the last few
years. Dr. S. Mark Williams, a
visiting psychology professor, is a
member of the graduating class of

- 1986. Because he has had the

opportunity to view life at
Davidson as a student and as a
teacher, he has been trying to as-
sess the question of the present
workload.

Williams senses that, though
the workload is “relatively the
same” as when he was here, “stu-
dents seem more involved in cam-

pus activities, such as service

projects or internships, and these

,may take away from their study

time. They are distracted by more

forces than when I was here. That’s
not to say that they aren’t working
hard.”

~ Other the other hand, some
professors feel the students are not
working hard enough. Dr.

. Hernandez believes that students

may not always take advantage of
the help available to them: “Isat in
my Office until ten at night for two
days before the last exam period,
and very few people came in to see
me.”

Dr. Anthony S. Abbott, the
English department head, decribes
the workload as “an issue about
which there is much confusion.”
He wonders if a “breakdown in
communication” has occurred be-
cause the faculty says the students
do not work hard enough, while
the students say they are over-
loaded. “If there is a problem, the -
only thing we can dois-explore the
causes,” he says.

At the same time, Abbott
points out the advantages of our
difficult workload: “None of our
students are intimidated in gradu-
ate school. They all do well be-
cause they think, ‘Nothing can be
harder than Davidson.’”

Tucker lectures on Monet's modernity

By Jonathan Brooks
Billows of smoke and steam float up to

the ironarches, while the screeching whistles’

of trains add to the chaos of the station
below. As Paul Tucker noted, Monet’s
paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare are not
the typical Monet paintings of rolling coun-
trysides or blossoming gardens. College
students may be quite familiar with the
artist’s attempt to extract a fleeting moment
in an attempt to seek the “eternal from the
transitory” in the natural setting of a coun-
tryside. In Monet’s paintings of Gare Saint-
Lazare, he appears to embrace the mecha-
nized world the train represents and affirms
the arrival of modernity.

Paul Tucker’s Thursday night lecture

dispelled many of the myths that viewers.

maintain concerning Monet’s life and work.
Tucker expressed that it was a common
misconception that during his life Monet
typified the poor, starving, bohemian artist
who was rejected by critics during his life-
time. He mentioned other artists for whom
that statement might be true, such as Renoir
or Van Gogh. He commented that Monet
was making more money than doctors and
lawyers of his day—15,000 francs more
than those high-paying occupations. Ac-
cording tothe scholar, Monet “enjoyed simi-
lar status [to that which he has currently] at
the end of his life. He was seen as one of
_ France’s great artists.” -

Tucker also expressed that impression-
ism still remains one of the most popular
styles in the visual arts. One might clearly

see the popularity of Monet as one looks
around a Davidson student’s room and ob-
Serves posters and calendars of Monet paint-
ings. He believes this “notoriety of his
painting has obscured their significance.”
While thousands of students in colleges

embrace prints of Monet paintings as some-

thing to grace their walls, they may not fully.
comprehend Monet’s interests, goals, and
accomplishments as an artist. Thus, Tucker
wanted to provure “an sa nia to see
things anew.”

Tucker’s lecture also focused on the
importance of Monet’s choice of subject. ~

the fleeting glimpse and painterly stroke
