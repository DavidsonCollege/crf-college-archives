Real Diversity

By David Bernstein

“Diversity” is the new shibbo-
leth of the self-appointed campus
race monitors. They demand
“diversity” of almost every kind--
race, gender, sexual orientation,
even physical ability. What these
folks won’ tcountenance, however,
is diverse opinions.

As a black college student at
the University of Maryland I
learned this truth the hard way. As
a black conservative, I was ostra-
cized by the people whoclaimed to
value difference because I was,
well, different. They didn’t mind |
that I was black, of course, but
College Park’s politically correct
student leadership seemed to pre-
fer ideological lockstep within their
“diverse” student body.

Fortunately, I was never sub-
jected to the kind of overt intoler-
ance that many black conserva-
tives endure, but there was always
a palpable disdain for me and my
views among other minority stu-
dents. One black sophomore, for
example, explained to me_ that

“white people are puttin’ those
ideas in your head.” Another of
my peers wrote in the student
newspaper that black conservatives
must be “neutralized” (whatever
that means). Still another person
once complained, “you just don’t
understand.” It came as no sur-
prise, then and when thé president
of Maryland’s Black Student Un-
ion refused to work with me and
the other black College Republi-
can when we wanted to bring con-
servative black speakers to cam-
pus. .
Like many black college stu-
dents, I found the student leader-
ship’s attempts to insulate me from
diverse opinions condescending
and antithetical to the idea of a
university education. Black colle-

gians should learn to appreciate |

the rich heritage of intellectual
debate and dissent that has defined
the black American experience.
Men like W.E.B. Du Bois, Freder-
ick Douglass, Booker T. Washing-
ton, Malcom X, and Martin Luther
King, Jr., did not share a single set

of ideas. Each came to his own
conclusions through study and
honestreflection. Ifany of us hope
to understand the “black thing”
referred to by those popular T-
shirts, we must try alittle study and
reflection of our own.

In 1905, W.E.B. Du Bois,
scoldeda young black girl when he
explained that, “there are, in the
U.S. today, tens of thousands of
colored girls who would be happy
beyond measure to have the chance
of educating themselves that you
are neglecting.” He further warmed
her that, “ignorance is a cure for
nothing...every time a colored
person neglects an opportunity, it
makes it more difficult for others
of the race to get such an opportu-
nity.. Do you want to cut off the
chances of the boys and girls of
tomorrow?”

The campus diversity mongers
should ponder Du Bois’ words.
Each time we refuse to consider
diverse opinions, we are “neglect-
ing an opportunity” to learn. Each
time a minority student leader

demands “solidarity” from his
peers he makes it more difficult for
others of the race to get such an
opportunity. And ignoring or ex-
tinguishing “western culture” in
the curriculum is truly a cure for
nothing.

Perhaps more important, this
desire for intellectual unanimity
and separation threatens to under-
mine more than twenty-five years
of civil rights gains. Black Ameri-
cans are Closer than ever to being
treated by white society simply as
individuals, butnow many minori-
ties themselves assert that race is
the defining characteristic of every
person.

How quickly we forget that
this was the very attitude that made
slavery possible, that has kept
apartheid alive in South Africa,
and that delivered Jews into the
Holocaust. I, for one, would rather
the average American did not be-
lieve that all blacks acta particular
way because they are black!

Similarly, I would rather not
toss aside many of the great works

service. The editors found the article meritous of republication in The Davidsonian.)

of science, philosophy, and litera-
ture just because their authors were
white. Black collegians can under-
stand and appreciate James Madi-
son, John Milton, and Charles
Darwin--just to mention a few
examples--as well as any white
student. To suggest otherwise is
racism in its pristine form.

My college experience has not
left me as discouraged as it might
have because I believe there has
been a quiet reawakening of inde-
pendence among most young
minorities. During the past year I
have met several other young col-
lege graduates who agree that we
need more genuine diversity of
thought. Together we have begun
amagazine, appropriately entitled
Diversity, which will explore is-
sues of race and culture free from
pressures to conform to the new,
self-imposed stereotype. I hope
this modest effort will spark other
young minorities to break free from
the orthodoxy as well.

Questionin’ That:
On a Certain Particular Advertisement

Our two anonymous students are
holding their bi-weekly discussion
in the.weight room of the Baker
Sports Complex... They’ve just
finished their workout, and now
they begin to converse while they
rélax in the fetal position, periodix:
cally taking a moment to writhe in
pain.

[Columnists’ note:. The flyer de-
picted in thiscolumn is based onan
actual party flyer distributed by
actual eating house members.];

J: So tell me buddy, if we manage
to stand up and make it out of here
by nightfall, what are you going to
be up to tonight?

A: I don’t know what I’m going to
do tonight.... Hey, what’s that on
the Lapko machine?

J: I can’t seem to make it out...it
seems to be some sort of a message
-- a flyer perhaps. Yes! Asa
matter of fact, itis a flyer, advertis-
ing another one of Patterson
Court’s fun-filled nocturnal gath-
erings.

A: Urghhh! (He says struggling
out of the fetal position). I’m rar-
ing to go, the music, the dancing,
the sparkling conversation and, of
course, those wayward souls stag-
gering around because they are
high on life.

J: I don’t want to kill your party
spirit, and I know that this may
sound like a stupid question, but
would you presently classify your-
self as a lesbian or wombat?

A: And if I was?

J: Well, it says here on the flyer
that lesbians and wombats should
notattend. Doesn’tthat seem rather
strange considering the fact that,
with the exception of wombats,

both are part of the Davidson com-
munity?

A: I don’t agree, my brother. Les-
bians, and gays for that matter, are
not a part of this community be-
causes the: community: aliénates
them and would rather pretend that
they didn’t exist... They say that
homosexual-bashing is the last
publicly permissible form of defa-

mation. This flyer is just evidence
of a huge problem on this campus.

J: Hmmm, I guess I never really
thought of it that way. I mean, I
guess I just figured that, since gays
and lesbians are here just like the
rest of us, they were automatically
apartofthiscommunity. Now that
I think about it, though, I’ve never
actually met anyone on campus
that I know to be a homosexual.

A: if I was a homosexual, or a
wombat for that matter, I would be
reluctant to open myself up to
anyone.

J: It seems sad that at a so-called
liberal arts institution people would
feel apprehensive about being

themselves. But you know, if
somehow gays and lesbians would
come out of hiding, then campus
awareness could be raised, and
some attitudes might even be
changed.

A: Even so, the onus is on us all to
be open enough to include every-
one.

J: Yeah, you’re right, it would be
unfair to ask gays and lesbians to
take responsibility for eliminating
the prejudices and fears of every-
one else. But attitudes regarding
homosexuality are so deep-rooted,
almost to the point of impermea-
bility. How can we break them?
Where do we start?

A: I don’t know. Perhaps we’ve
already started -- but in the wrong
direction. There are two kinds of
fear on this subject: the fear of the
knownand the fear of the unknown.
Homosexuals fear the repercus-
sions they know they’ll face, and

’ everyone else’s fear arises out of

ignorance.

J: I suppose I’1l just start by work-
ing on my own ignorance now that
I’ve pumped up my pecs and tri-
ceps. Hey! I think I’ve regained
motor control over the lower half
of my body!

A: Yeah, well, I’ve gotto getout of
here. Where did I leave my cap?

J: You’re wearing it, which is of
course against weight.room rules.
Let’s sneak on out before the Ath-
letic Director sees us, When shall
we talk yet once again?

A: How about next week?

J: Better thake that two’ weeks.

Peace.

A: Peace.

Sitting in the Back Row

This week’s topic in the Back
Row is a problem of serious di-
mensions. It is nota humorous
column this week, buta grave probe
into how the disintegration of
American morals.is. displayed on

‘| television, and other aspects of art.

Iwas sitting in-my room a few
days ago, and the sit-com “Mar-
ried With Children” came.on my
television. I have never seen sucha
trashy television show in my entire
life. It displays a portrayal of
American life in a twisted and
demented fashion that is only funny
because it is so horrible. Itis sad to
think that young viewers watch.
this refuse and enjoy it. The most
scary part of the whole thing is that
this type of television really influ-
ences childrén to think that this is
the way an American family func-
tions. People may argue this point
of influence, and in retaliation I
give you the movie New Jack City.
This movie is not excessively vio-
lent, butit prompted people to shoot
one another, The reason for this is
probably because the violence that
does exist is portrayed as casual
and as an everyday occurrence.

Then there is the show “Bev-
erly Hills 90210”, which is as
appalling if not more so than
“Married With Children,” It basi-
cally displays children as adults.
This show deals with extremely
mature themes and does not offer
any positive contributions to
American youth. It is ridiculous
how this show is so praised when it
really encourages pre-marital sex
at a young age and disrespect.
Some people may say that pre-
marital sex is not a bad thing. In
response to this, I point out the
divorce rate in America, which is
not the way it is simply because
people can not get along that well,
“the way they used to”. There is
also the slew of public figures like
Clarence Thomas who have to deal
with sexual pasts and whose pri-

vate lives become the focal point

of millions. I don’t mean to sound

holier-than-thou, but when we look
at the problems of youth corrup-
tion in the nation today, and see
politicians and citizens wonder-
ing;:”’"How did: this happen?,” I
want to:hand them a remote con-
trol.

The same thing is apparent in
literature and music. The book
Silence of the Lambs was a good
piece of literature that hada clever
storyline. While involving vio-
lence, it had a good enough plot to
excuse it. Then, after the success
of the movie rendition of Silence of
the Lambs, we see Bret Easton
Ellis come out with American
Psycho (clever title) in a blatant at-
tempt to simply make money off
being more disgusting than any of
the other previous psychological
thrillers. Ellis’s book graphically
displays such violence that at least
one publisher refused to print it. It
seems as though the more vile you
can be, the more successful you
can be. What is scary is that the
media works to help out the amoral
pieces of “art” be successful, and
the strategy works.

With music, the profane lyrics
get.all the publicity, and then the
“artists”, such as the band mem-
bers of Two Live Crew, come out
looking like American heroes
Claiming that they are trying to
exercise their first amendment
rights, but are not being allowed
to.

The whole issue comes down
to impressions. These influences
seen through television and the
mediacreate dramatic impressions
on the youth of today. Rather than
curb today’s entertainment to be
worse than the public actions,
which stimulates morbid curiosity
and encourages decay while mak-
ing profits, why not increase the
