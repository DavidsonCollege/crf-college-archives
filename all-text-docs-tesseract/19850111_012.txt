Strange, But True, Predictions For 1985!

By CRAIG DETWEILER
and KEITH EVANS

Just in case you missed Jeane Dixon and The Na-
tional Enquirer’s predictions for 1985, we have taken it
upon ourselves to make sure that you’ll know what’s
coming up in the New Year. As seniors, we feel obli-
gated to let Davidson underclassmen “in” on the trends
that will once again raise their ugly little heads. In under-
taking this weighty task, we’ve been careful to offend
every major faction, group, species, administrator,
edifice, committee, freshman, politician, athlete, schol-
ar, and dog on campus. If you’ ve been neglected or over-
looked, please take offense at our negligence (maybe
you don’t rate?). With the air thoroughly cleared, 1985
awaits...

%* Ok

Soft-spoken John Kuykendall will raise his voice —
once — to announce his resignation. He will reemerge
on the West Coast, Missy and the kids in tow, under the

pseudonym Rex Savage (or is it Sex Ravage?), lead
singer for heavy metal’s Twisted Dutchmen (or is it
Dusted Twitchmen?).

* *

The Women’s Concerns Comittee will get “concerned”
by the proliferation of imports. Borrowing from the
U.S.-Japan agreements, they will ask Queens and Salem
to impose voluntary import quotas.

* ok

The Gentlemen (?) of Kappa Alpha will find a dis-

tributor of milk by the keg and tap Davidson into a new
social era. (It’s not just for breakfast anymore. )

* OK

Desperate, shotgunning freshmen of the Class of ’89
will pool their resources and buy a hall BMW. Pink.

* *

D.G. Martin will set up his own scholarship fund
to rival the Stuart Scholarship program. “Martin Schol-

ars” will be chosen on the basis of hero-worship potcn-
tial, “tough, independent problem-solving” ability, ar and
susceptability to trip on coattails.

* kk

Admissions Director John Griffith will discover the
Platonic form of the “geek” in 1985’s applicant pool
and quickly break precedent by offering him a position
on the faculty.

* ok O*

Members of the Nuclear Awareness Committee,
Amnesty International, and the Peace Coalition will
realize they keep seeing the same people at each
meeting. They will merge to develop a deprogramming
hotline for students brainwashed by a conservative
upbringing.

* ok OK

The authors will be unemployed, unmarried, and
unavailable for comment in 1985, year of the
humorless youth.
