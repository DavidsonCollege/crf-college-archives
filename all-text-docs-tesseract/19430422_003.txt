THE DAVI

SOFTBALL

Although inter-frat softball is still some’ weeks off, the |
pick-up teams of Jack Wayman and ‘Roy Boy” Hunt are|
waging merry battles each afternoon at the rear of Watts. |
Wayman has built up quite a potent, unofficial aggrega- |
tion, mostly Pi Kaps however, und it seems that this fra-
ternity will be the team to beat when the regular season rolls
around. Wayman, besides being |quite proficient at the
plate, has found no peers as a hurler in this fast sandlot

Slickest fielder of the circuit to date is SEA’s

jeague, and he has amassed an enviable Strike-out record,
|

Tommy Powell,’ who is at home anywhere in the

infield. All-frat Lacy MacLean will be seriously

challeged in his position of KA backstop by the

advent of King Henry of Oxford to the pre-season

practice sessions and his good showing to date.
BASEBALL

The Wildcat nine is still seeking its first victory, /-hav-
ing dropped two more encounters last week, the first to Fur-
man, 19-6, and the second to Clemson's Tigers, 19-3. Tommy
Peters accounted for most of the few Davidson bingles,
collecting two for four each day.

Coach Shepard has made numerous shifts in the
infield in an attempt to find a winning combina-
tion. The starting infield against Catawba will
probably be: Walt Major or Freshman Blanton Belk
at the initial sack, Dick Phillips and “Bub Sweel”
at the keystone, “Ace” Maloney at his old spot at
third, and another freshman, Gene Desportes be-
hind the plate. The Carolina game on Wednesday
was the first big five encounter for the Cats; and
in Pre-flight, Davidson met one of the leaders of
the new Ration League.

Carolina seems to be the king-bee of the Southern Con-
ference baseball circles, undefeated to date in the loop. In
fact, their only defeat of the season was registered recently
at the hands of the Pre-flight nine, which boasts of many
recent major league luminaries and outstanding college stars.
The Tar Heels’ captain and shortstop, Lou Hayworth is one
of the most consistent swatters of the conference, usually
managing to collect at least two blows per game.

TRACK

Davidson’s .cindermen, by virtue of their win
over South Cafolina’s strong tracksters last Satur-
day, can enter the Southern Conference meet this
week-end in Chapel Hill with a clean slate. Out-
standing was the fact that all fifteen men making
the South Carolina trip for the Cats managed to
score at least one point. George Peters, a consistent
high scorer all season, had sustained a shoulder in-
jury earlier in the week in the Clemson baseball
game, but he participated in the meet and man-
aged to take two second places. Peters was beaten
in the high jump by. Carolina’s Chamis, who cleared
6 feet 1/2 inch, for the best mark registered in a
Davidson meet this year.

The Cats’ distance men shone with clean sweeps in the
mile and two-mile events, Brown taking the first race and
Grimsley the latter. South Carolina’s fine dash man, Riley,
took both the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes from David-
son’s Ben Lacy in the feature sprints of the afternoon.
TENNIS

The Cat Courtmen have lost three matches to
date in as many starts, but they have made a very
creditable showing in all these encounters. The first
two-matches with Carolina and Duke were both lost
in the final doubles match, giving the opponents
slim 4-3 wins. In the third meet, Davidson was
whitewashed, 7-0, by Presbyterian. College’s _per-
efmial national leaders. Although PC made a clean
sweep of every match, they praised the Cats as one
of their most tough and spirited opponents of recent
years.

The Davidson netmen, weakened ‘by. the loss of Co-
captain Buck Archer to the army, face, four tough matches
next week, Duke and Carolina there, and the Citadel and
Georgia Tech in‘home engagements.

MISCELLANY :

The baseball Ration League, composed of Duke,
Carolina, State, and N. C. Pre-flight, has been very
successful.” Each team meets the other three in
four games during the season, giving these four
schools, all within a radius of fifty miles, almost
full schedules. This Ration League idea may be the
answer to the sports problem in the eastern part of
the state, but what of Davidson in Big Five compe-
tition? Bs
Coach McEver now has a 7:30 A. M. physical ed class

of Aircrew students ... Major league baseball opens this
week-and-even after their poor exhibition showings, it looks
from here like the Yankees for another American League
flag and the Cards to repeat in the senior circuit.

Neisler Relieved

Traveling on to Clemson, Paul
Neisler took the mound for the first
four innings before he was reliev-
ed by Jim Lowry in the fifth.
Lowry held his own for three in-
nings before the game was called
in the seventh on account of incle-
ment weather. Peters again took
hitting honors for the locals, with
two bingles.

On Tuesday and Wednesday of
this week the Cats ran into even

Sprint Men Go To Chapel Hill
Friday

Davidson is sending thirteen men
to Chapel Hill this week-end to
participate in the annual South-
ern Conference track meet.

Every member of the squad who
nidde the trip to Columbia Tast
week, except Lennox Turnbull and
Dick O’Hair will be entered in the
éyents at Carolina.

Eight men, who are entering the
dashes and sprints, leave for Chap-
el Hill today to take part in the
preliminaries on Friday. The others
will go down Friday afternoon in
time to take part in the events
Saturday. ;

Stiff Competition

Coach Whittle does not expect
the Cats to make an impressive
team showing due to the stiff com-
petition they will face. Although
the Wildcats have mastered all
opponents so far, times: and dist-
ances have been considerably short
of marks set elsewhere in the con-
ference this year. However Ben
Lacy is being counted on to come
through in the hundred and two-
twenty, and Bill Lacy and’ Dick
Port should show up well in the
hurdles. George Peters may not
participate in order to give his in-
jured shoulder a rest before the
important meet with State next
week.

-~. VOLLEYBALL

Only three games of the inter-
fraternity volleyball competition
had been completed Monday:

Kappa Sigma won two of the
three contests completed, com-
ing off with victories over the
Pikas and the SPE’s last week.
The KA’s downed the Pi Kaps in
the other encounter.

Unfavorable weather condir
tions have caused the postpone-
ment of a number of the match
but the tourney is expected to
get in full swing this week.
