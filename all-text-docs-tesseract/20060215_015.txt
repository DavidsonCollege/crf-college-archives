The men’s and women’s ten-
nis teams took on several major
conference teams last weekend,
suffering a pair of one-sided
losses at the hands of two tough
teams,

The women traveled north to
Blacksburg, Va., on Sunday to
take on Virginia Tech. The
Wildcats, now 3-3 on the sea-
son, were shut out by a 7-0 mar-
gin.

The men’s team also suffered
a 7-0 loss over the weekend, as
they were defeated on Saturday
at the University of South
Carolina. Despite the setback,
they regained their winning
ways on Sunday with a 7-0
home victory over Belmont
Abbey.

The women entered the
Hokie match with hopes of
notching another victory over a
strong national program, but the
’Cats were unable to overcome
the stronger Virginia Tech play-
fm ers and their home court advan-
tage.

New records abound at
Clemson Tiger Invite

The men’s and women’s track teams par-
ticipated in the Clemson Tiger Invitational
last weekend in preparation for the upcom-
ing Southern Conference Indoor
Championships.

Despite competing against several major-
conference opponents, the ’Cats held their
own in many events.

For the second weekend in a row, Douglas
Noreen ’07 set a new indoor track school
record. Noreen, who set a new standard in
the mile run last week at the Carolina
Invitational, this time made school history in
the 800 meter.

His 1:56.02 mark not only placed him at
the top of the Davidson charts, but also
earned him a third place finish in the meet.

. Brad Troxell ’08 finished closely behind
Noreen, coming in fifth place with a time of
1:57.69.

“T have been very pleased with my season
so far,’ Noreen said. “I am really looking
forward to using the experience and training
from‘ this season and having a great confer-
ence meet.”

Ryan Hubbard ’08 also set a school record

for the second consecutive week, breaking
his own mark in the 200 meter. Hubbard’s
22.94, which earned him a 17th place finish
out of 42 competitors, was five-tenths of a
second faster than the 22.99 he recorded at
Chapel Hill.

In addition to the efforts of Noreen and
Troxell in the 800 meters, the men enjoyed
three other top-10 finishes at the Tiger
Invitational. Sam Morris ’08 placed seventh
in the mile run with a time of 4:26.33.

Lance Harden ’09 raced to an eighth place
finish in the 3000 meter with a time of
8:49.79.

In the 5000 meter, James Garrett ’09 post-
ed a 16:17.25 clip that was also good enough
for eighth place.

On the women’s side, Megal Atias ’08
made the most noise with a victory in the
3000 meter.

Atias held off a South Carolina opponent
by more than two seconds, and her time of
10:16.83 was only three-tenths of a second
off the Davidson record. Allie Martin ’06
came in eighth place in the event, crossing
the finish line in 10:30.37.

Katurri Phillips 08 added a spark to the
women’s effort with her performance in the
200 meter dash.

For the second straight week Phillips set a
new school record, blistering past the 26.89
she posted at North Carolina with a new
mark of 26.75.

The future is bright for the ’Cats in the 200

_ meter, as Kimberly Colley ’09 is already on

the Wildcat top-five performance list with a
time of 27.55, the exact time she ran in back-
to-back weeks.

“The team just seems to really be coming
together well,” said Hubbard. “We support
each other in every event; we have had some
very strong performances and we are excited.
and prepared to do well at conference.”

The ’Cats return to Clemson on Feb. 24-25
to conclude their indoor season at the SoCon
Championships.

- “A lot of our athletes over the course of the
season have improved with every race, and
the team is looking very strong heading in
conference,” Noreen said. ’

third straight match, took an early 1-0 team
lead in the play, sweeping all three doubles
matches.

“We got off to a flat start in the doubles,”
said coach Caroline Price. “Virginia Tech
was aggressive and solid, staying on top of
us and putting the pressure on. We were
always on our heels.”

After getting swept away in the doubles,
Davidson tried to regroup for the singles, in
which the Wildcats would need to win four
of the six matches. Despite an increased
intensity level, the ’Cats were unable to
derail the Hokies, who boast two singles
players ranked in the top-100 nationally.

Virginia Tech swept all six singles match-
es, sending Davidson home with a 7-0 loss
and lowering the Wildcats’ record to 3-3 for
the spring season.

“We were a little disappointed with the
way the doubles turned out,” said Price, “but
I’m proud of the way we came back in sin-
gles and made some good runs. Virginia
Tech was simply a stronger team.”

The men’s team entered Saturday’s match
at South Carolina with a 3-1 record for the
spring, but they faced a tough test against the
Gamecocks, ranked 12th in the nation.

The Wildcats’ doubles woes continued, as
they lost all three doubles matches and yield-
ed the early 1-0 lead to South Carolina.

Flaviu Simihaian ’08 dropped his first sin-
gles match of the year 6-2, 6-4. Simihaian

had won his previous four matches.

Only Joe Cheaney ’06 and Philip
Compeau ’08 were able to get anything
going against the Gamecocks doubles
tandems, losing a closely contested 8-6
match at the number three position.

“We’re still not where we need to be in
doubles,” said coach Jeff Frank. “We’re not
sharp enough; we’re missing too many
serves and returns.”

Despite their lack of success in doubles,
Davidson came out fighting in the singles
matches. Each of the six matches was com-
petitive, although ultimately the Wildcats
were unable to overcome any of the South
Carolina players.

John Bolton ’07 made the best run at vic-
tory of any Davidson singles player, but fell
short at the number five position when he
lost a third-set tiebreaker.

Sunday’s match against a shorthanded
Belmont Abbey team gave the ‘Cats a
chance to get back in the winning rhythm, as
the team easily rolled to a 7-0 victory.

None of the matches went beyond the min-
imum sets required to win.

“Singles-wise, we’re playing very well
right now,” said Frank. “But we still haven’t
figured out the doubles. That’s our goal for
the next couple of matches.”

The women return to action on Feb. 18
with a home match against Liberty, while the
men next host Lees-McRae on Feb. 19.
