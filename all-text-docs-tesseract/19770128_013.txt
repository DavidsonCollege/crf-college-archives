The Davidsonian

Wit

By BRENDA BOYLE

To have looked at the
7-woman team from Newberry
College, the ‘‘Squaws’’, one
wouldn’t have thought the
basketball game on Tuesday,
January 25, would be very
interesting.

The game got off to a slow
start, with numerous turn-
overs. The Cats seemed to be
playing as a unit, but too
many of the attempted shots
were consistently off.

However, by the time the
clock read 12:03, the game
sped up considerably. David-
son’s passing also made a
marked improvement.

Sara Womack hit shots
consistently from the upper
left corner of the key, and at
7:36 the score was 18-14,
Davidson’s favor.

Coach Susie Roberts put the
full-court press into action, a
very effective move. Both Kat
Morton and Cindy Morrison
poured shots in from under the
basket.

No matter how effective a
press, however, Newberry
started a comeback, and con-
sistently scored. Davidson put
the prescribed plays into act-
ion, but these were not the
needed medicines.

By 6:09, all seven of New-
berry’s team members had
played. Before half-time Dav-
idson pulled up its suspenders
and roared ahead, 43-28.

Kat Morton, in her typical
kneeling position, made a
tremendous save, Beth Tanner
hit several consecutive shots
from the top of the key; and
finally everything began to
click.

Fifty-one percent of the first
half field goals and fifty
percent of the free throws were
completed.

The second half of the game
began with essentially the
same scene as the first, al-
though speeded up. Nora Mc-
Neill,and Ann Clark both
entered the game during this
half.

By 14:58, Davidson was
playing well offensively, and
playing a very tight defense.
Sara Womack still put shots in
consistently.

Although at times New-
berry came “‘too close’ David-
son kept well ahead of the
““Squaws’’. B.T. and Sara
continued to dominate the
boards by hitting again and
again.

At 3:30, Bonnie Caulkins
relieved Ann Clark as center.

’ The game ended in victory for

defeat Newberry,
winning record upped to 6-4

Davidson, driving the Cats
record up to 6-4.

Beth Tanner was top scorer
with 25 points, and Sara
Womack not far behind with
22.

Sara was also top reboun-
der, with 11 rebounds, and
Cindy Morrison had nine re-
bounds.

Thirty-eight percent of the
field goals, and 25 percent of
the free throws were comple-
ted during the second half.

Following the game, several
players commented that they
‘wish that the team as a whole
had played better. We’re not
unhappy that we won, by any
means, but just wish we’d
played more consistently.”

Coach Susie Roberts ex-
pressed virtually the same
feelings with ‘‘I’m ina good

What more can I say?”’

SARA WOMACK shows some of her skill in ball
mood, and have been all day. Nandling in the Cattes’ game against Newberry.

Coaches Patton, Pritchett anticipate
similar action in game on Saturday

By DEAN EKLUND

The Wildcats play East
Carolina University in Green-
ville, N.C., in what should be
a good test for Davidson.

The Pirates of East Caro-
lina, like Davidson, also have
a young team, only one senior
and one junior out of a squad
of eleven, and they have been
hurt by the same problems
that have plagued Davidson.

East Carolina Head Coach
Patton indicated that offen-
sive inconsistency and young

mistakes are the two major
problems that have held his
team back.

“The game Saturday night
will probably be like when we
were down there with David-
son being patient on offense,’’
Patton said.

“They will probably be in a
zone defense, we’ll use our
standard man-to-man défense.
It’ll be a low scoring ball
game.”

Coach Patton cited Jim
Ramsey and Larry Hunt as his
two most effective offensive

players; they scored eight and
five points respectively ag-
ainst the Wildcats on the ele-
venth.

During the previous en-
counter between the two
teams Herb Gray, who led
ECU with 14 points but was
shaken up when he went high
for a dunk and came down
hard on the floor. Gray hasn’t
been the same since.

“Gray got banged up down
there and hasn’t had a good
game yet,’’ said Coach Patton.

Davidson Head Coach Dave

Pritchett also anticipates the
game Saturday night to be
similar to the game with ECU
at Davidson.

But Pritchett said, ‘‘We
always start in a man-to-man
defense, it helps us loosen up
and get moving on offense.”

Coach Pritchett feels that if
the Cats can maintain their
poise on offense and continue
their fine defensive play which
they have exhibited through-
out the year, that Davidson
will have a good chance to
come home with a win.
