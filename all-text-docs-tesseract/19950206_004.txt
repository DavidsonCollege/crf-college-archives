Shandley, Lewis stay with students

By Mary CLare JALONICK

As a part of the ongoing effort
to improve student-faculty com-
munication, several professors
have stayed on residence halls this
year. Two weekends ago, Dean of
Students Tom Shandley and Pro-
fessor of English Cynthia Lewis
braved Davidson’s dorm experi-
ence.

Shandley stayed on 3rd West
Belk, a hall of male freshmen. He
ate pizza and went to the basket-
ball game with the hall. After that,
they played cards until late at night.
He slept on a bed in the lounge.

Says Shandley, “It was a great
chance to get to know a few guys
well, and I hope that they will feel
comfortable stopping by my of-
fice. Big events are not the way to
meet the students.”

Lewis had a different sort of
experience. She stayed on 2nd
Acres and did not get to meet many
of the girls on that hall. Instead,
she went to court parties with the
resident advisor.

At first Lewis “felt like an
oddity ... [think that people thought
that I was a monitor or something.
I didn’t really feel like it was ap-
propriate to participate, so I be-
came an observer. Once I got used
to that, I started talking to students
I knew, and it was fun.”

Second Acres R.A. Tina

Kanter felt that the students at the
party “were really happy that she
was there. It seemed like she had
fun. I think that it was really healthy
because I think that a lot of profes-
sors have a cloudy perception of
Patterson Court.”

Lewis seemed surprised at the
atmosphere. “It really struck me
that the whole social scene has
remained the same in many ways
since the faculty went down there
more normally when the drinking
age was lower. But it has also
changed in some more heartening
ways to me — I felt that people
were more comfortable with them-
selves. The genders seemed to be
more comfortable with each other
than when I was in school.”

Shandley sees this interaction
as a wonderful way to increase
relations among different sectors
of the community. “We are trying
to find more meaningful ways to
increase the interaction. In the
broader sense I think that this is
something that brings everyone
together a little more. We will do
this as long as people are willing.”

Third West Hall Counselor
Dave Christopherson agrees. “It is
a good opportunity for the faculty
to see residence hall life.”

The experience seems to have
brought out the best in Shandley.
“They got me to do the twist at half
time,” he says, “and that is a major
feat.”

Butts may be sold on campus

The SGA passed a resolution
Tuesday advocating the sale of
cigarettes on campus. The pro-
posal was drawn up by newly-
elected SGA President Bill Gullan
for the convenience of regular
smokers and the safety of “‘week-
end smokers,” those who only
smoke while drinking.

“This is something that should
be done,” Gullan said Tuesday.
“It’s a matter of the safety of stu-

students’ role inthe Union: “Ifthe
students want it, we need to hear
it.”

As for the near future,
Shandley sees two possibilities.
“Either we do something immedi-
ately, which would be useful to
students right now; or we bank it
and keep raising money.” ~ He
doesn’t know yet’ which path to
take but says that much will de-
pend on the amount involved and
the student access to the facility
during construction.

Nat May, a member of the
planning committee, shares
Shandley’s enthusiasm for the
project. “I am excited about the
idea of using Johnston Gym as the
new Union, with its history as the
focus of the campus for many
years.”

dents who smoke.” The availabil-
ity of cigarettes on campus would
put students at aconsiderably lower
risk of driving to buy more after
drinking. :

Currently, the closest places
to buy cigarettes are Backstreet
Cafe and Dover’s, both of which
close before midnight.

The proposal will be reviewed
by the future Director of Auxiliary
Services, Richard Terry. Terry
declined to comment on the future
of the resolution until he assumes
his position in April.

Dean Shandley and Hall Counselor Dave Christoperson reminisce about

the lounge keg party and the strippers.

tickets and made that the main
focus ... we saw the lighting issue
more at the forefront, because it
concerns safety and security on
campus.” Rudell says, “atthe SGA
meeting, people wanted to stress
parking alot more. We decided to
send the letter ourselves ... we used
the SGA as a backboard.”

Successful negotiating

Sutton, Thrower, and Direc-
tor of Physical Plant Bob Collins
met Wednesday, and Rudell and
Dervan received word that they
would have full funding for light-
ing. According to Dervan, the
three administrators “had decided
that student support for lighting
was strong, so they will take money
straight from the general fund of
the college to improve lighting ...
no matterhow much it costs, it will
get done.”

Rudell says the administra-
tors.decided to take money from
the general fund instead of setting
up a security fund because “if you
re-route money to different areas,

also says that they have obtained
“pretty much a blank check” for
lighting needs.

Finding problem areas

On Wednesday at 7 p.m.,
Rudell, Dervan, Thrower, Jonathon
Orr (head of the SGA security coun-
cil), and an electrician will walk
around the campus to find areas on

campus which mostneedimproved °

lighting. Rudell encourages “‘any-
one who has preferences (of light-
ing areas to be improved) to let us
know.”

Both Dervan and Rudell have
already considered areas which
need to be improved: the areas
close to Chambers, Ridge Road
parking area behind the senior
apartments (which, according to
Dervan, has no lighting and is con-
sidered by police a very dangerous
area), Dormitory Row between
Duke and Watts (where trees may
need to be trimmed to allow lights
to work more effectively), the area
between the library and Duke, the
area behind the library at the exit of

Richardson andthe Commons, and
the sidewalk leading from the
Union to Main Street (the lights on
the path in front of Dana and DCPC
stand several feet from the side-
walk itself).

In addition, Rudell says that
“some of the soft yellow glow lights
really don’t do a lot” and may be
replaced. The project will not be
cheap, as, according to Rudell,
“some lights cost $1,500 or so.”
But, according to Rudell, “‘all the
lighting that is necessary will be
there by the end of the year.”

A victory for students

In the past, students (notably
Orr) have tried to push the issue of
campus lighting. Dervan asked
Orr to help prioritize trouble areas
“because I knew he had worked on
this before.” Dervan also credits
Dean Shandley for “being very
willing to help fix the lighting prob-

‘lem on campus. We also need to

give credit to Collins, Sutton, and
Thrower for their swift action.”
Devan says, “This is a victory
for the student body. It shows that
the administration is willing to re-

the24-hourroom, the areabetween spond to our needs.”
