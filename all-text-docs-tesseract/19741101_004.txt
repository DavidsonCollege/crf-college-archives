Letter Of The Law

THE DAVIDSONIAN has tried to
provide an open forum for the ex-
pression of a variety of opinions in the
Davidson College community.

Our ‘‘Letters to the Editor’. column
has been an important aspect of these
efforts. Submitted letters have been
included regardless. of their
ideological viewpoint. They have
been changed or omitted only when in
need of grammatical revision or
when space limitations did not permit
their publication.

We think this is an essential portion
of our service to THE DAVID-
SONIAN’s readership. Such
diverging comments often enrich and
guide the development of a ‘‘free’’
press.

Yet, we feel it necessary to express
a word of caution over such letters.
Our policy has been to print as many
letters as possible, but in many in-
stances, those that we have received

are blatantly libelous. These we can-
not print.

£

Fair comment and criticism with
reference to matters of public in-
terest or importance is acceptable
since it is not for malicious purpose or
injury to reputation. Words which
tend to expose a person to public
hatred, shame, disgrace and ridicule,
or which tend to induce an ill opinion
of one in the minds of right-thinking
people, are libelous.

We would urge those who submit.
letters to the editor to be responsibile
in their comments and approaches.
THE DAVIDSONIAN will not offer a
forum for an individual who wishes to
Pag personally or libel someone
else

If those who submit letters are to
contribute to the advancement of high
quality journalism, they must main-
tain high quality standards of reser-
vation and responsibility.

Letter To The Editor

Administrators Take Pupils
Over High-M inded Knee

To the Editor:

“When in the course of human
events...’”’ These are indeed the proud
words of a heritage of singleminded
American determination in the pur-
suit of the high ideals of freedom and
God-fearing decency. At last, the
wanton course of human events at
Davidson College has been tempered
by the sage and timely censorship of
the school yearbook by ad-
ministration officials

I say at last, because my past years
at Davidson College have been
scarred by an inevitable awareness of
the underlying profligacy of the the
student body in general. Immorality
and indecency have become the nor-
ms rather than the unthinkable, or
certainly, unspeakable exceptions.

There have been instances of gam-
bling, card-playing, alcoholic con-
sumption and narcotic drug use.
More visibly, pornography abounds
in the dormitories, and not only
movies, but shameless “skin” movies
are regularly shown at the fraternity
houses and even presented openly in

the guise of an acceptable part of cer-

tain classroom subject matter.
All of this misconduct, in addition to

flagrant pre-marital co-habitory,

practices in the dormitories, con-
stitutes an affront to all proper
morality sufficient to sicken the
stomachs of all right-thinking
Americans.

The recent efforts of certain mem-
bers of the student body to permeate
the school yearbook with their own
brand of scurrilous filth is just
another outward symptom of a grave
land foreboding moral sickness from
within. I am proud to say that I was
raised by two old-fashioned, but far-
sighted parents who knew that you
have to beat God into children if they
are to learn right from wrong.

I just hope that the administration’s
taking the student body over its wise
and high-minded knee will signal the
beginning of a long-awaited and
much-needed return to the old ways

apd values; eventually returning us
to mandatory chapel, ROTC, coats
and ties and the other ideals we know,
to be good and right.

Trustees Squelch

Innovative Annual

I never have found a
suitable response to that age-
old query as to what is reality
anyway, but lately I’ve felt a
little shakier on the point than
usual. I think I’m losing my
temporal orientation. Every
day I check the calendar to
make sure this really is the
1970's.

Whenever have you seen
such neatly-dressed, clean-
cut, politically indifferent
students at Davidson College?
The religious groups are
making their imposing
presence ‘felt and seen, cam-
pus-wide dances have retur-
ned live and kicking from the
grave,. and the hoary in-

‘stitution of the Homecoming

Queen has_ survived a
malicious, insidious attack by
certain non-believers in the
college community.

In case you haven’t heard
about this latest stab-from-
the-past, here’s the story: a
certain eating house (I'll only
use its first initial, ‘‘A”) ap-
parently either decided that
the institution was too hoary to
be respectable, or else they
were just being absurd, as
usual, _(‘‘A’’--Absurdista?
Anarchists?) because their
nominee, being of the male
sex, was most unsuited for the
appellation ‘‘queen,” in the
more traditional sense of the
word,

When news. of this tran-
svestite travesty leaked out on

. campus, those who cherish the

time-honored ceremony were
duly aghast and let their
feelings be seen. After all,
wouldn’t this hurt the feelings
of the alumni and the more
conventional contestants?

they argued and complained. —

Happily, justice being blind,
but. perfectly capable of
hearing, the judges
unanimously (4-0) booted the

uestionable candidate out of

running, and then tongue-
lashed the irreverent con-
spirators at “A~” for their
lack of school spirit.

Well, in spite of such an im-

\

posing victory for the forces of
the past, this couldn’t com-
pare with the real time-bomb
of the season, one that really
took us all back.

In one fell swoop, our ~
masterful administration
managed to conquer the
Ravages of Time and to set the
image of Davidson College
back at least twenty years. I
admit I wouldn’t have
believed it possible, but it’s
done, and you can’t argue with
facts, right? |

With impulsive derisiveness
and foresight-that could only
be described as. later
Nixonesque, — the ad-
ministration moved quickly to
squelch efforts by some to
print two dirty words and
some dirty pictures in the
yearbook. This move, coun-
tering as it did the trend of the
last ten to twenty years to
treat students more as adults
or, at least adolescents, and
less as children, predictably
attracted a great deal of at-
tention in the news media, and |
the salvaging of Davidson’s
Christianity became hot-news
all over the place.

Now, if that weren’t enough
to get me confused, the reac-
tion on campus would have
finished the job. Among’a sur- .
prisingly large number of
students and faculty, the
rallying cry was heard:
“Freedom of the press, yes,
but only if it’s in good taste!”

This could only have. been
encouraging to the ad-
ministration, who may have
sent up this escapade as a trial
balloon, so to speak. Now that
they have successfuly stood in
good stead against the forces
of student responsibility,“ one
wonders what the next move
will be. How would you feel
about re-instating compulsory
chapel on Tuesday night?

I don’t know. I’m still trying
to figure it all out. I think our
fifties nostalgia is spilling
over into reality. How you feel
about that depends on your
position, I guess, and I’ll leave
itatthat. —
