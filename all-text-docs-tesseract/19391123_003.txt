[ Question

oO the Week

Although Homecoming dances are
far in the

not past the campus is
the scene of many a discussion on
Mid-Winters. Since this is the case
the question for this week is:

“What type of band do you prefer
for Mid-Winters and do you have
any preference among the current
hit bands?”

_ Bill. Perdew, Senior:

Personally, I prefer a name band,
of course, that is versatile. enough

Miller Sproull, Junior:

I prefer a versatile band with
both sweet and swing arrange-
ments. Glenn’ Miller would °come

nearer to fulfilling the requirements
or fulfill them as well as any band
that I know. If we get a band that

that only plays slow sweet music,
many will be dissatisfied. Why not

Elmer Knoeller, Sophomore:
Preferably I would choose a band
that dealt especially with sweet
music, something on the order of
Glenn Miller or Tommy Dorsey.
Last year had two for
the dances. This year. I would rec-
ommend one good big name band
for the whole set, even if it meant
an additional dollar or two.

“Porkie’ Woodward, Sophomore:

By all means a big name band. I
think the plan last year was fine,
but I believe that it would be bet-
ter to have one band for the whole
set. I prefer a swooth sweet band
with variety. Glenn my
choice for a better set of dances,
and under the present conditions I
should think that he would be bet-

Joe Barnwell, Freshman:

“Tha Treshnian maybe sorbotd-asy

to voice an opinion’ in such a mat-
ter, then I would like to express my
preference for the Mid-Winter’s
band. We would all agree that a
band that is versatile enough to
“send” even the most enthusiastic
Jitterburgs and at the same time
please the smooth dancers would be
an intelligent choice. Charlie Barn-
ette’s band of recent popularity is
well qualified for both styles of
playing without the least bit of
“corn”, and therefore receives my
vote for the delightful Mid-winter
dances. .

Hector MacLean, Junior:

Yup! I am in favor of getting one
of the good Hawaiian bangs to lay
us an illusion of blue moonlight and

Winters. I am against the ri-di-di

outfit can provide that mellow
background which is so conducive
to a successful week-end. After all,
the dances are not really the in-
tegral part of the week-end but
merely form a background for in-
troductions and trivialities.
