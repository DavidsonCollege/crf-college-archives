ABOVE: The vehicle that so totally looks like the Vamonos Van when

you’re dark and its drunk out

Holy crap, student
just got on wrong van

CORNELIUS—In what has been met with
a campus-wide chorus of ‘how the hell did
he actually manage to do that,’ Mario
Swartz ’06 mistook another vehicle for the
college-operated Vamonos Van this week-
end. Instead of heading back to campus
after an early night out this Friday, Swartz
found himself en route to The Pines.
“Holy freaking crap, I’m on the wrong

“Oh who am |

van,” said Swartz out loud, just moments
after stepping aboard the excursion ve-
hicle of Davidson’s most prominent re-
tirement village. “I’m surrounded’ by old
people, and I’m on the wrong van.”

The confusion leading to the blunder
began when Swartz and a group of friends
were departing Cornelius’ Galway Hooker
Irish Pub after some early drinks Friday
evening, and were preparing to board the
Vamanos Van, as they usually do, back to
campus. Coincidentally, The Pines van

BRIEFLY

was stopped out-
side the Galway
Hooker at the ex-
act same time, in
the process of
transporting resi-
dents back home
after a late evening
of Bingo at the
Cornelius - area
Lion’s Club.

“Apparently they had to stop at the bar
because some resident was having a blad-
der control problem or something,”
Swartz later reflected on the evening.
“Which I guess is sort of a coincidence,
because I had told my group to wait up as
we were running out so I could use the
can. God, after all that stout I had to piss
like a race horse.”

As Swartz ran out of the pub to join his
departing friends, he inadvertently
stepped aboard the wrong vehicle. “They
look exactly the same,” said Swartz, “ex-
cept for the little sign on the side or what-
ever. I mean, it was dark—and I was
pretty drunk... Oh who am I kidding, I’m
never going to live this down.”

Realizing that both vans had already
gotten underway, Swartz had no option
but to ride back to Davidson with a bus-
load of senior citizens. “It’s not like it was
all that bad,” he recalled. “In fact, they
seemed pretty happy to see me. I learned
an awful lot about the Korean War, and
even got to play some Cat’s Cradle. Which
is actually sorta fun when you're wasted.
In an I’m going to die soon sort of way.”

Having since had time to reflect upon
the incident, Swartz is proud that, despite
his inebriated state, he was able to ascer-
tain that something was wrong within
moments of stepping on board The Pines
vehicle. “I’m sorry, but Davidson girls
don’t look ¢hat bad,” he said. “And I’d
been drinking.”

The Davidsonian

In Response to Feb. 11 “DCPC ‘prank’
in fact big corporate marketing deal”

am sitting here in Daytona with

my pit crew on the eve of the big

one, the 500. Though my pit

boss is yelling at me to get back
on the track to test his latest set-up, I felt
the need to e-mail in this response to
your in-depth reporting on our worthy
attempt to display our new NASCAR
corporate logo from the DCPC church
steeple.

What you said was all true, but re-
quires a bit more explanation. Yes, our
church leaders have been concerned
about the decline in Sunday worship at-
tendance. Some had been telling me
since my arrival at DCPC that lama
poor preacher, but I had assumed they
were referring to the amount of compen-
sation they are offering me. Turns out
they meant something else. Duh!

What finally caught my attention was
the one Sunday in the past year when we
could not blame bad weather for our
poor attendance, and I preached my
heart out to the small congregation but
the offering plate had just its usual smat-
tering of one dollar bills. Desperate to
turn the ship around, the next day I
shared with our governing board that
prior to entering the ministry I had expe-
rience with driving go-karts. So why not
try our hand at NASCAR racing?

This led to the decision to invest
church funds in the venture. Then came
the now-famous “Boogity, boogity,
boogity” Sunday, after which construc-
tion engineers were called in from Physi-
cal Plant to check the structural stability
of the DCPC roof, unaccustomed as it is
to such enthusiastic outbursts. Then el-
der Kennedy did his daring thing with

letters to

THE YOWL

the steeple clock. Now it is race week in
Daytona and...well, here we are. Pray for
us to fight the good fight and finish the
race, receiving the crown of victory.

While we are here, I have been
preaching from the roof of the infield
concession stand each evening. After all,
that is how Robert Schuller got his start |
and that led to the Crystal Cathedral. |
Man, are they hungry for the Word down
here! We plan to return to our corner in
Davidson near the left field foul pole of
the campus and really stir things up with |
some crazy contemporary architecture |
and wild worship.

Thank you for the Yowl’s continued
interest in DCPC.
