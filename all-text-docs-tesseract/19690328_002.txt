ROTC Has To Go

We've waited long enough. It's time
for compulsory ROTC at Davidson
to end.

The Blue Sky Committee has pro-
posed it, and the faculty has endors-
ed it. Said the committee: ‘No ques-
tion before us caused greater concern
among us, but we are united in our
conclusion that Military Science. as
a subject matter in a curriculum, is
not compatible with the ideal of the
liberal arts and ought not to be re-
quired of anyone.”

And, for what it’s worth, the stu-

“Crisis” or not, the Senate has a
responsibility both corporately and
individually to the students here.
Students have a right to expect to he
represented reliably. When thev are
not so represented it reflects unfavor-
ably on all students.

The student Senate brought a vol-
untary ROTC resolution before the
Educational Policy Committee of the
faculty in January, and faculty com-
mitteemen declined to act on the
resolution without “new” information.
Senate representatives consented to
collect the information and return at
a later date with the proposal.

It can be argued that such addition:
al information was not necessary, that
the proposal stands on its own merits.
but the students agreed at the time
to get the information requested.
Five weeks later the Senate sent over

a spiced up resolution — without
any of the information agreed upon
in January.

The faculty committee promptly
sent the resolution back to the Senate
with the promise that the committee
would consider the proposal when the
new information was collected’ and
presented. So the voluntary ROTC
proposal is still where it was, where-
ever that is.

Do students deserve better repre-
sentation than this? We think so.

*

dent Senate unanimously recommend-
ed that ROTC be voluntary.

There is good reason for these ac-
tions. It's extremely questionable
whether a college can be “second to
none in the service of God and man”
(as the trustees’ statement of purpose
savs) and require military training.
it-is likewise incredible that a college
as committed to the pursuit of truth
as Davidson says it is would allow
the Pentagon to appoint members of
its faculty and autonomously run an
“academic” department.

In addition, there is little evidence
to show that ROTC would be elimin
ated by making it voluntarv. Rather.
fhe reports we’ve cited before from
other schools where ROTC is volun-
tarv or has recently gone voluntary
indicate ‘that ROTC hasn't been hurt
by being voluntarv. In fact. going
voluntary even heloed the program
at the University of Tennessee, accord-
ing to one of the officers there.

On the other hand, who says Da-
vidson needs even voluntary ROTC?
The college is here to provide a lib-
eral arts education and to serve hu-
manity. It is not here to serve just
our own society or even the United
States, but man. And how ROTC

training at Davidson provides a lib-.

eral arts education, trains students
in the pursuit of truth, and serves
humanity is beyond us. ;

But whether voluntary ROTC will
survive or not isn’t really the issue.
But if you think that’s important,
then you can rest easy, for the chances
are exceptionally good that, compul-
sory or not, ROTC will survive here.

The trustees meet May 9, and will
once more have to decide the ROTC
issue. This time, we urge the trustees
to listen carefully to what students
and faculty are saying and abolish
compulsory ROTC. To do less will
constitute a betrayal not only of the
principles on which Davidson College
is founded, but also of the people
Davidson seeks’to serve.

Go Fly A Kite

In the few short days left in March, go enjoy that most Marchest of

pleasures. While the chance still remains, go fly a

kite.

For notice: The winds of this gusty month will soon abate. Then the
gentle rains of April will pierce to the root the March drought. and call
forth the warm sun of May. And then, the season to fly kites will be gone.

What’s more. the trees. so newly repaired after the winter’s dam-
aging snows, will soon have their year’s fill of those paper birds, and no
longer will there be a chance to do battle with the kite-eating trees. (By
the way, Davidson has three of that rare species, according to the Biology

Wasted Time

About that vote on constitution
amendments last Tuesday:

While some students were voting,
others were taking an ROTC exam
for the second term. This is because
ROTC is still compulsory here.

And that exam itsélf wasn’t sched-
uled by students. It was set up by the
registrar’s office.

In other exams, the only women
involved were two professors and a
few students’ wives. That’s because
Davidson is still sexually segregated.

Students taking those exams re-
turned to rooms looking like slums.
And that’s basically what they are.

The faculty administering those
exams is segregated, both racially and
religiously, and sexual integration is
but token, All the professors are white.
All the janitors are Negro.

When these students who voted re-
turned from spring vacation, which
was only four days long under a
faculty-passed schedule, many did not
have cars because the admissions com-
mittee won't allow it. Those who did
have cars were parking down by the
fraternity court or tennis courts when
their destinat‘on was the dorm. There
wasn't enough parking.

And meanwhile, back in the lobby
of Chambers, the vote continued...

Why the vote? Basically because the
student government is arguing over its
constitution.

One side in the ridiculously vicious
infighting before the vote said the
Senate Executive Cemmittee violated
the constitution and bylaws. That they
did, obviously. And the principles of
democracy, fair play, etc. ‘on which
they challenged the violation are im-
portant, obviously. _

But the violation was trivial, as the
other side pointed out. For the SGA
to .get ensnared in trivialities was

wrong, obviously.

But what neither side could see was
that the whole thing was as irrelevant
as the SGA itself.

Both sides prolonged the issue, and
both did so needlessly and childishly.
And in the process, what relevancy the
SGA did have slipped farther away.

So while the president and vice
president of the SGA sat manning
the polls (the Elections Board got so
sick of the mess that it resigned.),
ROTC was still compulsory, the school
wasn’t coed, scholarship students can’t
have cars, exam schedules were still
being planned by the Registrar’s Of-
fice, and soon....

Pray tell, what is a student govern-
ment for?

1,000 Believers

It all seemed a bit odd when the
local newspapers shed their prior pre-
judices following Lefty Driesell’s an-
nouncement of his plans to retire and
turned their type to praise for the
controversial coach. And it was laid
on a bit heavily, too.

But when all the praise and the pre-
judice were laid aside, it was quite
obvious to everyone that Davidson
would miss Driesell. Indeed, Driesell
has left his mark on this school, not
only in building the “academic giant”
into a basketball power, but also in
spreading the name of the schoo] be-
yond the Catawba.

Regardless of one’s stand on sub-
sidized athletics, in spite of the aca-
demic disapproval of his courtside
manner, the fact remains that David-
son owes a great deal to Lefty Driesell.
And when he claims that Maryland
will soon be the UCLA of the East, at
least 1,000 persons believe him. Drie-
sell is a winner.

The significance of that question-
naire distributed by the Commission
on Athletics a month ago seems to
have gone unnoticed: that giving ath-
letic scholarships and trying to play
bigtime ball costs a hell of a lot.

At least it laid to rest that old
myth that basketball supports the
whole sports program. Incredibly
enough, basketball alone loses over
$56,000 a year, including coaches’
salaries.

Perhaps not so incredibly, football
loses the whopping sum of over $241,
000, compared to $90,200 for all other
sports combined.

It is perhaps not legitimate to count
coaches’ salaries into the total loss,
since we presume we would have
coaches if the teams were not sub-
sidized. Without these, football loses
$185.000 and basketball about $13,000.

From this it would appear advan-.

tageous for Davidson to approach its
commitment to big-time football. at
least, with a little scepticism.

As the report points out. if some
of. those receiving athletic. grants did
not have them they would be eligible
for scholarships on the basis of need.

larships, for instance, would not yield
a saving of $122,000, the amount of
football scholarships, but the saving
would be considerable.

What it amounts to is that the 903
students who are not receiving ath-
letic grants are paying pretty close to
$100 a year. for subsidized athletics.

Not only that, but the college per-
sists in its archaic policy of refusing
to aHow students with need scholar-
ships to keep cars on campus while
those with athletic scholarships are
allowed to. There is a narrow and
hypocritical favoritism about this that
is repulsive, and the college does-itself
a disservice when it treats students in
this manner.

We are nut so foolish as to think
that at any time in the near future
there is a possibility that the giving
of basketball scholarships will be de-
creased. Pragmatic considerations
seem to take hold at Davidson over
much less prestigious issues than this.

But if ethical considerations will
not prevail perhaps the financial onus
of shelling out large sums for football
will cause some questions to be raised
in the student body.

Rowland Reaffirms
Constitution Stand

To The Editor:

Several weeks ago Phil
Riner asked me to take char-~
ge of several-cases he want-
ed to bring before the Court
of Appeals. Having been a
member of the constitutional
convention and being ac:
quainted with the objections
he was raising. I agreed.

Since then I have been
amazed at the misinterpre-
tations of my stand and
would like now to clarify
my _ position.

Initially, the whole affair
centered afound violations
of constitutional provisions,
but now I see the matter in
a somewhat grander scale.

I will not argue the merits
of a constitutional form of
government (cf. Hamilton,
Jay and Madison in ‘The
Federalst Papers’) or its
applicability to a small col-
lege campus. I prefer to ar-
gue for something more bas-
ic — honesty.

The members of the cam-
pus legislative. executive
and judiciary. bodies are all
sworn to uphold and enforce
the constitution. It seems
that conscious violation of
such an oath comes under
the heading “honor violation”
and might seriously be con-
sidered by the Honor Court.

At any rate, the student
government is sworn to obey
the constitution and I be-
lieve that it should be re-
quired to do so.

Another objection is
that the constitution is not
workable and that since the
job of government is to be
effective the student govern-
mént is justified in its dis-
obedience.

This objection is easily
attacked on several grounds.

First of all. how is it that
Peter Hobbie finds the con-
stitution unworkable when he
helped rewrite it just last
year?

Secondly, the campus gov-
ernment is obligated to up-
hold the constitution from

‘which it draws all its power.

When it finds the constitution
getting in the way it is ob-
ligated to amend the cun-
stitution according to spec-
ific procedure.

The next objection raised
is that my position rests on
procedural legalisms alone,
but I beg to disagree. My
stand rests on the premise
shat honesty professed should
also be practiced.

In other words, if we claim
to have a constitutional gov-
ernment, let us have one:
but, if we do not want a con-
stitutional government, let
us not institutionalize hypo-
crisy by claiming a constitu-
tional government.

The final objection rais-
ed concerns consequences:
“doesn't it matter?” In that
student government professes
to be an exercise in demo-
cracy, I say it matters con-
siderably whether we have
tyranny or democracy.

General student apathy con-
cerning the current consti-
tutional crises adds no weight
to arguments of those who
would unabashedly violate
sworn oaths of office and
constitution alike.

Perhaps you wonder whe-
ther I have proof of consti-
tution violations. Not only
have I proof, but a consider-

able amount of it has been.

presented in court by Phil
Riner and myself to the ef-
fect that on several occasions

the student government has
violated its ‘own bylaws,
the constitution, and various
court orders.

Further more, I am_ will-
ing to discuss .the matter
with anyone interested in
agreeing or arguing as long
as the discussion proceeds
not on emotional personal-
ity corflicts, but within the
framework of reason.

The Defense Corporation

Although I, too, have been. aroused by such rumors
as “Will H. Edmunds White follow Lefty to Maryland
to be director of admissions there?” and “Has the
basketball bubble burst?”, a recent news item about
the Defense Department was even more arresting.

Defense Secretary Laird said that he was alarm-
ed at how many retired generals took jobs with com-

anies with large defense contracts and how this must
influence some of those multi-billion dollar decisions

they make.

Now when Melvin Laird is alarmed about the
goingson of the military-industrial complex, you know
that it has to be something really serious.

But there is a simple solution to the problem.
Therefore, | propose that to forestall any further

encroachments of business on the military, and since
business already controls the military anyway, that
all the functions of the Defense Department be turned

over to private enterprise.

This proposal is not only in the best American
tradition of opposition to big government, creeping
socialism, etc., it would yield numerous other bene-
fits.

Private industry can undoubtedly do things much
more efficiently than the Pentagon. I recently read
somewhere that the United States is spending around
$300,000 for each Viet Cong killed in Viet Nam. Now
the Mafia normally kills somebody for a paltry $25.-
000. Why not let private enterprise do it, and save
a lot of money?

With a little cost analysis and a few. efficiency ex-
perts, this country could avoid getting into unprofit-
able wars and supporting unprofitable governments
in small developing nations.

As a recent chapel speaker suggested, we could
trade those South American, African and Asian coun-
tries on the international market if they didn’t pay off.

Besides, there wouldn’t be any of this wasteful
killing of women and children on the side. If Dow
Chemical had to apply cost accounting to all that
napalm, you can bet that no excess villages would get
burned. .

And what if some hardheaded, no-nonsense busi-
nessmen were handling the Paris peace talks? If
they were losing roney on the deal, they would end -
it in a hurry.

Since Wall Street already varies dramatically
with the rise and fall of this country’s war fortunes.
the dissolution of the Defense Department wouldn't
interfere with normal stock activity.

However, a few subtle social changes would occur.
In addition to “captains of industry,” there would
also be majors, colonels and generals. Not to mention
a few executives, junior grade, and chief petty officers
and warrent officers, otherwise known as blue-collar
workers.

With the vast store of knowledge and practical
experience now residing in the Mafia. or “Cosa Nostra’
as it is known among the in-crowd. the killing end
of the business could easily be turned over to them.

This would bring the syndicate even more out
into the open than they are now. They could be listed
on the Big Board with all- the other “defense” com-
panies. And that $4 billion a year income they make
could be taxed at regular corporate rates — with, of
course, suitable writeoffs or depletion allowances for
personnel lost in action, wear and tear on equipment,
etc.

A provision could be written into the contract

requiring the Mafia to declare all their holdings in
Swiss banks and on the stock market. Many have long
suspected that Swiss banks were not only used by the
Mafia, they were owned by the Mafia. There would be
no point in declaring amnesty for any of their past
crimes, as the government could never convict them
anyway.
As President Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover agree,
the real threat to the country is campus disorders,
not organized crime. So we should call on these out-
standing businessmen to bring peace and calm back
to our. nation’s campuses.

With a little Mafia efficiency and free enterprise,
Mayor Daley’s little show of force would look like
one of those typical clumsy government efforts which
should have been left up to private industry.

After all, free private enterprise is the backbone
of our jiation, the foundation of America's freedom.

viently enough, is all male.
Moreover, this school has a
basketball team that more
than makes up for our lack.

Those guys played a terrific
season, and we here at Win-
throp think they have earned
every word and gesture of
praise and apprecation in
the superior manner of Dav-
idson gentlemen.

Over the season we sort of
adopted them as our own.
followed them faithfully, and
they never failed to make

us proud.

The team’s record speaks
for itself. Twenty seven wins
out of 30 starts is no
small accomplishment. Even
that heartbreaking final
game, though not a victory.
should be regarded as a star
in the crown of the team.

Though some tend to blame
the loss on one player, let's
face it, how do you guard
god? Every man’s perfor-
mance showed the unselfish
effort and determination that
oe cae makes a great ball club.

The close of the season has
taken the thrill out of tear-
ing-through the morning pap-
er to the sports page. We
will all feel the loss of the
colorful men. including the
coach, who are leaving . .. .
we're sure that next year's
team will continue in the
same inimitable manner.

To this year's team, to be
honest but. trite, we know
you're NUMBER ONE! !
