How to
outsmart
NC stream
fish

By JoHN RoE
Outdoors Columnist

As the hot days of summer
draw to a close, outdoorsmen all
over the country flock to the woods
to pursue their favorite spots.

THE GREAT

OUTDOORS

Some carry their boats to a
favorite river, some hit the trail,
while others dress in blaze orange
in pursuit of whitetail deer. While
I enjoy all of these activities, there
is no place I would rather be than
wading the many mountain streams
that North Carolina and Tennessee
have to offer.

Whether your quarry is trout,
bass, or maybe just anything that
swims, a cool stream offers the
best angling opportunities.

To catch fish in the fall, it
helps to first understand why the
fish are biting so well this time of
year. Coming off the warm water
months, the fish sense a change in
temperature. Knowing that the cold
winter season is fast approaching,
fish of all species start on a feeding
binge to fatten up for the slow,
lethargic days of winter.

This situation can make catch-
ing fish very easy, but there are
other factors that help tip the odds
in the fish’s favor. In the fall, the
water becomes very clear and

. Streams usually flow at their low-
- est water volume of the year.

The combination of low water
levels and excellent water clarity
makes it possible to try sight fish-
ing, but be careful. If you can see
the fish, they can certainly see you.

In these clear mountain
streams, the fish will be on con-
stant guard against predators, es-
pecially fishermen. Any quick
move, unusual shadow or noise, or
any sense of danger will send these
hungry fish to the nearest cover.

In order to catch these fish,
you: must act like a stalker. Wear
drab, natural colors and always try
to stay out of the water whenever
possible. Try to kneel behind
streamside boulders to break up
your outline, and, most impor-
tantly, always wade upstream.
Wading downstream, anglers can
kick up debris, alerting fish of their
presence before the first cast is
made.

There is no better time of year
to fish streams. The fish, as well as
the landscape, take on their most
spectacular colors of the year.

FOOTBALL

Davidson was looking to start a
season 2-0 for the first time since
1979, as they hosted the Fighting
Scots of Maryville on Saturday
afternoon at Richardson Field.

But due to some crucial Wild-
cat mistakes and tough breaks
throughout the contest, Maryville
edged Davidson in a tight 28-21
win that could have easily gone
either way.

Although the Cats won the
coin toss, they opted to receive the
kick in the second half instead, in
an effort to establish their strong
defense from the get-go. Coming
into the game, the Davidson “D”
ranked second nationally in Divi-
sion I-AA rush defense, having
allowed an anemic 12 yards on the

Learning’s the
thing for Ingerick

By Matt Pitzer
Sports Editor

If anyone asks how much an

- education is worth, senior Rhett

Ingerick can tell you it’s more than
$10,000.

That’s how much the Florida
Marlins offered the pitcher after
drafting him in the 47th round of
the Major League Baseball draft
this summer. |

Ingerick and the Marlins went
back and forth for a while, trying to
work out some type of arrange-
ment so Ingerick could stay at
Davidson this fall and then attend
spring training next year.

“They never offered me any-
thing that was worth missing my
senior year for,” Ingerick said. “I
told them that not finishing school
was not an option. I needed to get
my education complete and then

worry about baseball.”

The two sides never reached
an agreement, but Ingerick was
able to play in the well-regarded
Cape Cod league this summer.

The Marlins relinquished their
rights to Ingerick once he attended
class, and he will enter the draft
again next year. Ingerick said other
teams have shown some interest,
and, Wildcats coach Dick Cooke
still has some contacts from his
minor-league days. Those two fac-
tors should be enough to earn
Ingerick a shot somewhere in the
spring. :

“T really can’t lose,” Ingerick
said. “Evenif baseball doesn’ t work
out, at least I always have my edu-
cation to fall back on.”

Davidson player drafted this year
