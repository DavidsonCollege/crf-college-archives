FIRE ALWAYS MAY BE CONTROLLED

Davidson College Would Have Today the Grand Old Chamber
Protected from the Peril of Fire the Way

Built to Burn

Is the subject of a placard that
may be tacked on most of the insti-
_tutions of learning—in fact, on most
of the institutions of any character,
in this country.

And all that is necessary to com-
plete the announcement is: “Time
Past Due But Not Yet Arrived.”

Davidson College deferred the in-
evitable for a longer time than usual,
perhaps, but the Fire Fiend is a pa-
tient devil and bides his time, and,
finally, in his soul-scorching pyrog-
raphy, inscribed the name of David-
son in his list along with Cornell,
Wellesley, Vassar-and other colleges
which were vulnerable to his atacks.

Those who doubt the vulnerability
of most institutional properties to
attacks of fire had better study the
fire record.

“There are burned on an average
€évery week ten schools, two college
buildings and three public halls,”
said Commissioner P. P. Claxton, of
the Bureau of Education, Depart-
ment of the Interior, Washington, in
the introduction of the booklet, “Fire
Protection for Schools,” prepared
and printed for the Department by
the National Fire Protection Asso-
ciation.

It is estimated by the Actuarial
Bureau of the National Board of
Fire Underwriters that school prop-
erities go up in smoke at the rate of
$6,000,000 a year.

But the peril to human life is in-
calculable.

Who’s next?

Among those not likely to be in
the Southern States are:

In North Carolina: N. C. College
of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts,
West Raleigh; School for Deaf and
Dumb, Morganton. :

In South Carolina: Clemson Col-
lege, Calhoun.

In Georgia: Georgia School of
Technology, Atlanta; Columbus In-
dustrial High School, also Second-
ary Industrial School, Columbus.

In Mississippi: Mississippi Agri-
cultural and Mechanical College,
Starkville. ‘

In Tennessee: Vanderbilt Uni-
versity, and Buford College, Nash-
ville.
|_In Texas :_ Texas—Textile-School,
College -Station.

Why?

Because they are equipped with
apparatus for automatic control of
fire—automatic sprinkler systems.

The Essentials of Fire Safety

A concise and comprehensive de-
scription of the reason why will be
found in “Fire Protection
Schools,” prepared and printed for
the

Fire Protection Association,

tion.
“The next best thing * * * is to see

beyond question the most depend-
able device for accomplishing this,
as is witnessed by a remarkable rec-
ord of performance covering thirty-
five years, which is summarized in
the following statement unanimous-
ly passed by the National Fire Pro-
tection Association at its 1914 con-
vention: ;

“It is today an almost unquestioned
fact that automatic sprinklers afford the
highest degree of protection against fire
in practically all cases where there is
combustible construction or material,
the rapid burning of which is liable to
be a menace to the lives of occupants
of the building.”

“Structural improvements «and
tle use of fire-resistive building ma-
terial in new buildings make possi-
ble a degree of safety in them which
cannot be secured in existing struc-
tures except by the application of
automatic sprinklers.”

“Some school boards arid princi-
pals either have not understood the
value of sprinklers or have been
prejudiced against them, but in
many of the older schools automatic

Jsprinklers are the logical answer to

“Sprinkler heads are made with a
special soldier which melts at about

will discharge 15 to 20 gallons of
water per minute in the form of a
drenching spray over an area of per-
haps 15 feet in diameter. As the
sprinklers are seldom placed over
10 feet apart, these spray circles
overlap, and a fire has little chance
to burn or spread.”

Appreciation of Automatic Control
of Fire

Several years ago the insurance
commissioner of ‘the State of South
Carolina made a public appeal for
consideration of the principle of au-
tematic control of fire thru the offi-
cials responsible for the safety of
life in the institutions of learning
and mercy in that State. In part he
said:

“I am taking the liberty of asking
your consideration of the installa-
tion of what are known as automatic
sprinkler apparatus in such huild-
ings under your care as need com-
plete fire protection for the safety
of the buildings and the safety of the
inmates.

lam thoroughly persuaded that
the matter is one of great impor-
tance in respect of the safety of the
buildings—aind—theives-ander—your
care,

Concerning its investigation of
the fire hazafd in the Minneapolis,
Minn., schools, the Council, Parents
and ‘Teachers’ Associations of that
city said:

“There is an element of danger
present which cannot be denied by
those familiar with the facts.

“This condition no doubt exists in
many of the American cities, and
many of ‘the officials that are sup-
posed to look after the welfare of
the citizens make their investiga-
tions after, rather than before a
catastrophe.

“During the investigations of this
committee and from unbiased testi-
mony from experts, and research, it
has developed that the Automatic
Sprinkler is the best agency for the
preservation of Life and Property
from fire,

“The committee has failed to find
any loss of lives from fire in a build-
ing that had been properly equipped
with a sprinkler System, and_ this
commiftee will recommend that all
non-fireproof schools be equipped
with the most modern system that
can be procured,”

Recently a fire in the Oregon State
Hospital, Salem, Oregon, was con-
trolled by an automatic sprinkler.
Concerning “this Superintendent
Steiner said: .

“The damage was slight from the
fire. The sprinkler as usual was on
the job and produced ideal results.
The presence of the Automatic
Sprinkler System in our institution
certainly relieves us of a great deal
of worry and has saved the state
many times more than its cost of in-
stallation.”

Examples of the Remedy Before You

has been laying waste to the edu-
cational institutions of the country
touches the modern textile industry
very lightty.

Why?

Because the textile industry has
been tried by fire, apprehends the
economic havoe of it, appreciates:
the limitations of insurance and the °
vital need of fire-control.

And how has it been done?

By automatic control of fire by
automatic water sprinklers which
are opened by fire itself.

It would be impossible to operate
the textile industry at all without
automatic sprinklers. They are just
as essential as the machinery of pro-
duction and the sheltering buildings.

Why ?

Because the frequency of process
fires in cotton mills, for example, is
more than in any other kind of hu-
man activity.

But despite this frequency the cost
of fire insurance in the modern cot-
ton mill is less than in any other
class of endeavor.

And this has been brought about
by automatic control of fire.

What is said in the preceding
paragraphs applies with particular
force to theemills of North Carolina.

What it has done for the preser-
vation of the textile industry auto-
matic fire control by automatic
sprinklers will do for any other class
of property.

Automatic sprinklers have been
putting out fires for over 40 years.

Today it is estimated that up-
wards of 20,000,000 persons work
daily under this protection.

How many school children and
students in the country are gaining
an education under similar protec-
tion from the peril of fire? The
answer is, Not very many!

Ask any progressive fire insurance
agent for informaggon about appara-
tus for automatic¥ontrol of fire, and
he sure that it is of the kind approv-
ed by the Underwriters’ Labora-

tories.
