Getting more out of life

I am out of ideas. Not just for
articles for The Davidsonian, but
for everything I am doing in my
life. I have nothing else witty to
say about literature and the visual
arts because I have said everything
that I could think. Nothing left to
write about in my journals for
Women Writers because my muse
is lying on the ground desperately
begging for something nourishing
to drink. She is dying of dehydra-
tion (assuming she is a woman)
and there is no Oasis in sight.

Of course, teachers will argue
that there purpose is to nourish my
muse, and I suppose that is true. In
fact, I would like nothing better. I
like when ideas flow from my mind
like red wine at a Catholic wed-
ding. I like red wine, for that

matter, Unfortunately, my. muse
lives much in the same way as a
plant. When she is dehydrated, she
wilts. When she is watered too
much, she drowns.

responsibility makes me ready for
life. If their version of life has no
weekends, I want no part.

So what doI do? Well, as was

what I inferred they meant to im-
ply, though they could have been
implying something other than I
inferred. But I doubt it.

My teachers seem
hardly to understand
this: too much water will

ers might also argue that having

suggested by our esteemed editors
last week in “‘My Life in a Box,”
Davidson students tend to concen-
trate on the work, climb and climb
the mountain, forgetting to look
around at the view. At least this is

- grabbing a snack here
and there between classes. I would
eat breakfast but I always stay up
late studying and so I need to catch
up on‘my sleep. I eat dinner as
quickly as I can so that I can get
back to work and leave time for

some other shige: But wait, if I
stopped doing other things, only
ate slept and studied I could get all
of my work done and not cause my
mind to wilt under the strain of so
many demands. Right. Eat, study,
eat, study, eat, study, sleep... and
again. That is not a life.

So what is the moral? Well, if
teachers are going to assign so
much work we have to give up
something else, and by this time of
the semester, everything else. Or
we can give up sleeping andeating ~
and do everything else that we
want to. Burn the candle at both
ends, baby. Or, you might con-
sider passing all of your core re-
quirements in time so that you don’t
have to take five classes, ever. Just
a thought. .

El Jéfe

Positivity

People around here complain
far too often. Look at the pages of
the Opinions section. “You use
too many expletives, you didn’t
recognize my organization enough,
I don’t like this about our school,
RLO is slow, the yearbooks are so
late that we should find the people
responsible and kill their families,”
Well, most of those appeared here,
but anyway, you get the point.
People at Davidson love to com-
plain. .

I certainly can point no fin-
gers as I am as guilty of this trend
of negativity as anyone. It’s just so
much easier to criticize something
rather than fix it. So I’m going to
make a bold move this week and be
Mr. Positive, the all new, super
constructive El Jéfe. Everything
you read below will represent hon-
est congratulations for jobs well

done, and sincere suggestions for —

improvement from the keen in-
sight possessed only by El “Mr.
Chipper” Jéfe.

First and foremost, good job
Rusk on that police thing this week-
end. Definitely an enjoyable date
function. The decorations were so
clever, and the “Jailhouse Rock”
section was a big hit. Some skep-
tics might criticize the overcrowd-
ing, but I think it was brilliance
incarnate. At one point I saw a
crazy frat guy I know pass out
either from alcohol or the 103 de-
gree temperature, but did he fall
and hurt himself? No, a human
wall of semi-formal dancers
wedged closely behind kept him
upright for at least 10 minutes until
his date noticed he was uncon-
scious. Good work!!

Second, that Rusted Root con-
cert last weekend rocked. I really
felt like I was outin the woods with
Ranger Rick and his crew of earthy
people. Quite a sketchy bunch,
those Rusted Rooters, but they
could sure play a washboard, and
that drum interlude towards the

end was certainly a treat for kids of

all ages. Just a hint, though, some- .

one might want to tell those guys to

hit the showers. I ran into one the
third floor of the Union and mis-
took him fora bum. I’m not saying
they should go clean cut or any-
thing, but earthiness and stinkiness
need not go hand and hand. Or
perhaps they could change their
image to be more like those ever-
so-hard- rockin’ Nelsontwins. You
remember, those identical twin
glamrockers with long, long blonde
hair. They were the coolest.
Ahhhh, glam rock.

Third, and this is just a sug-
gestion, but in the future, please
don’t send seniors a GPA scale
that illustrates their place in the
class. It’s very disheartening to
learn as a first semester senior that
you are pretty well locked up in the
eighth decile (that’s toward the
bottom, you understand). For those
who aren’t confident in their men-
tal prowess, a position in one of the
lower deciles could seriously shake
their self-confidence. That would
be a shame. We can’t have
unconfident people walking around
here, it’s depressing. So if you
knowsomeone who’s really dumb,
go up to them and say, “Casey,
(just a random name with no rela-
tion whatsoever to anyone I might
know or live with) you’re a damn
clever guy (or woman, if you know
afemale named Casey). Don’t pay
those decile things any mind.”

Actually, I do know a guy
named Casey, but he is very smart.
He’s got a GPA in the high threes,
a phenomon I can’t figure out be-
cause he also wears airbrushed T-
shirts and thinks East Texas is the
cultural center of the world. But I
digress. Just remember, if you are
in the eighth decile,twenty percent
of the school is still dumber than
you. Those in the tenth decile, you
may have to start hanging out at
UNCC.

Well, that’s about all the posi-

tivity [can muster for now. Being

up-beat really takes a lot out of
you. Plus, this article is late, and
my co-Davidsonian people already
hate me. So happy happy, joy joy.

the LNFMC._ A disadvantage in
the overall favorable option of con-
tracting with the LNFMC is that
they simply do not prescribe the
MAP. (As discussed by Ms. Ringle
with your reporter, a counterbal-
ancing women’s health advantage
with the LNFMC is that they offer
prescription for the injectable three-
month birth control, Depo Prevara,
which our previous provider would
not prescribe.) What we did was to
discuss our needs seriously with
Dr. Campell, who quickly helped
us make an arrangement with local
OB-GYN specialist, Dr. Mark Pea-
cock, to provide evaluations for
student MAP requests, on the same
availability as for his own patients.
We ascertained that Planned Par-
enthood is available as another
obtain for this service. Our staff is
quite committed to helping the stu-
dent in need to obtain the service
desired. Thus, students do have
“an option.”

It is unfortunate that the cur-
rent arrangement requires the ten
or so students per year affected to
pay a private provider for this spe-
cialized service, as noted in The
Davidsonianarticle. Considerably
more students must deal with other
specialized services, such as or-
thopedic care or the services of a
psychiatrist, the costs of which are
also born by individual students

because we are not capable of pro-
viding such specialized services
with current resources. Recog-
nize, too, that-the amount of $100
to $135. (depending on provider
selected) is a one-time cost and
that emergency loan funds are
available for any student who truly
cannot raise the money. I would
add that Student Health will con-
tinue to seek a service that is even
more accessible in terms of prox-
imity and cost. :

As you can see, the issue here
has been much more about the
day-to-day complexities of pro-
viding health care than about insti-
tutional indifference or “legisla-
tive morality.”

Frankly, I was disappointed
by your editorial. It cast the Stu-
dent Health Services as indifferent
or even adverse to students. Noth-
ing could be further from the truth.
The statement that students were
ignored is patently false.

Two students nominated by
the SGA, Debbie Liverman and
Lucian Dervan, have served on our
Student Health Advisory Commit-
tee since last Spring. They were
apprised of these very issues at our
meeting in September. Their in-
valuable questions and comments
have been an ongoing part of our
perspective on all the decisions
made.

Ms. Ringle has met regularly
with Student Health and Other Con-
cerns (SHOC) committees, thus,
they too have input. The selection
of the LNFMC as our contracted

medical staff was primarily a best-
option decision based on specific
requests of students as expressed
in the SGA resolution last Spring.

- You asked, “who makes these
decisions {about health services?”
The answer, clearly acknowledged
in my open letter to the community
published last Spring in The
Davidsonian, is that 1do—although
I do so with much input from stu-
dents, faculty, staff, and the Dean
of Students Office. Accessible to
anyone wishing to discuss any as-
pect of health services at Davidson,
I was, in fact, interviewed on Fri-
day, October 27, on a different
matter by the same reporter who
wrote the MAP article.

He asked me none of your
questions. No one called me to
discuss any of your issues. When
The Davidsonian addresses an im-
portant issue about health care at
Davidson, students would be
helped much more by researched
answers rather than rhetorical ques-
tions.

Asan alumnus, staff member,
and parent of a student, I have a
strong sense of community at
Davidson College and want the

‘best health services possible. Our.
staff and I are working very hard to
engender a restored sense of con-
cern and-quality of care so that no
student will be hesitant to use the
Student Health Facility.

Sincerely,

David Staton, Ph.D.

Director, Student Health

from page 7

things are better left unsaid.
I am certainly no writer, but I

canread. Iexpectthecontributing -

writers of the paper to attempt to
submit articles that do not have to
scoop from the dredges of slang, or

even skim the surface for that mat-
ter, in order to convey a message.
A writer who must resort to such
tactics is simply exposing his or
her inability to compose an intelli-
gent composition.

I realize the dilemma of the
editors when they come across a
piece that may contain a question-
able phrase or two. Therefore, I

would put it to the writers to evalu-
ate their own work. Does The
Davidsonian not purport to be “the
South’s foremost college weekly?”
If indeed it does then I am surely”
not alone in thinking that it should
stand by its claim.

Sincerely,
Dewey N. Ervin, Jr. ‘99
