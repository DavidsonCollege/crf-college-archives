THE, DAVIDSONIAN

BASEBALL PRACTICE GETS UNDER WAY.

CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

It’s all over now and not much use
talking about the past, but we would
like to have a little more to say about
the basketball season than we actually
have. It is very hard to figure just
why the team went down so much at
the end of the schedule. We-ate con-
fident that Davidson’s team had abil-
ity enough to handle any of these state
teams around here, and when you
know a thing like that it’s mighty
hard to swallow such defeats as we
experienced last week.

Carolina came out like a meteor
here at the last and undoubtedly
has a powerful team, but the idea
of the Tar Heels handing the
Wildcats a 45 to 7 licking is absg-
lutely inconceivable. We would
have bet our last dollar that it
couldn’t happen. Duke didn’t sur-
prise us much, but we sort of fig-
ured that the Cats would pull to-
gether and wallop State.

That Carolina team can never be
left out of the final figuring. They
started the season in poor style, and
seemed to have no prospects of a
championship contender. Now they
are a very serious threat to any team
in the conference, and we won't be
at all surprised to see the Heels cop
the championship, though they have
rough road ahead if they do. The
Washington and Lee Generals are big
favorites, and we rather side with
them. Tech and Mississippi Aggies
are sure to make plenty of trouble
before it’s all over.

This thing of picking an all-state
team for the year is going to be
about as hard as ever. There is
really no man in the state who has
cinched a place, in our estimation,
unless it is Frank Goodwin, State’s
gigantic center, and he has good
competition in  Croson of Duke.
Al Dowtin’s prolonged absence
from the Wake Forest line-up will
hurt his chances some, but he will
still receive due consideration, with
the chances good of his sewing up
a berth at forward. Satterfield,
of Carolina, Young, of State, and
Pritchett and Calhoun, of David-

son, are all due their “reward.
Brown, Carolina, Farley, Duke,
Good and Johnston, of David-

son have all had their good spots.
Yes, sir, when we pick our team
next week we'll have finished a

hard job.

Buck Marrow is bidding fair to de-
velop into Davidson’s savior as a
heavy-weight wrestler. Not since the
days of the Huntersville Terror, Har-
ry Vance, has the squad had a man
who was big enough to swap on even
terms with opponents. The way in
which Buck got rid of his men in the
State and Duke matches looks prom-
ising: for next year.

This is perhaps the slowest sport
season of the entire year. For
three weeks there will be little ac-
tual varsity competition. All teams
will be rounding into form and
with the first of April all will blos-
som forth at once, keep the most
ardent fan busy to hold the pace
of seeing all in action.

Heath Whittle stepped out up at
Virginia's indoor meet. Harry Flippen,
the best bet of the Cavaliers, beat him
by a hands breadth in the finals after
Heath had shown his heels to all com-
petition in the preliminaries.’ We ex-
pect this Georgia boy to show the

‘home folks something when he goes
down for the Tech Relays next month.

Captain Fred Ratchford and his
diamond mates are determined to
pull an old-time jubilee this spring,
and the way they are going after
that apple in early practice bodes
no good for teams on the Wildcat
schedule. No foolin’, prospects
look good. Mighty glad to see a
game with Cornell on that old card.

Carolina, Duke, N. C. State Win
Over Cats—Locals Tighten
Up Against Terrors and
Blue Devils

The Davidson Wildcat basketball
team invaded the strongholds of Duke,
Carolina, and N. C. State last week

and.dropped an encounter to each
team. The Duke and State games
were tight affairs throughout, — al-

though the Cats finally ended up on
the short of the but the
Tar Heels administered a severe drub-
bing to the Monkmen. The Cats play-
ing ten games in thirteen days, seemed
to have gone stale, and their play was
away off form, especially in the game
with Carolina.

Davidson took Duke Thursday
night at Durham, They were unable
to keep pace with the lengthy Croson
and his mates and came out on the
short end of a 33 to 25 count. The
Wildcats fought them all the way but
were unable to stop Croson. How-
ever, all his other teammates were
so closely guarded that none succeeded
in getting more than four points. Cro-
son was high-point man of the con-
test, looping in 17 points. Captain
Pritchett, of the Wildcats, pushed him
to hold his lead, however, he getting
13 points to double the total turned
in by. his other teammates.

The Wildcats moved on to Chapel
Hill Friday and received the worst
drubbing of the season at the hands
of Carolina. The Cats game was off
standard, and they were so closely
guarded that they succeeded in get-
ting only two field goals. The. final
count was 45 to seven in favor of the
Phantoms. Satterfield, scoring star
of the Heels, was high point man of
the game, getting 14 points. Marpet
and Hackney each got more than the
combined total ‘of the Wildcats, the
former getting nine and the latter
eight. For the Wildcats the scoring
was all done by Calhoun, who got
four points, and by Goodson, who got
three.

The Wildcats finished up the season
at Raleigh, meeting the N. C. State
Terrors. The Cats seemed to have
recovered from their malady of the
preceeding night and turned in a game
that they could be proud of. The
score at the half was 22 to 11 in favor
of the Terrors, but the Wildcats open-
ed up the next period with a rush
that carried them to within three
points of the State five, holding them
scoreless for eight minutes of the
period. However, the Wolfpack again
started their scoring and finished the
game with the score 30 to 22 in their
favor. Goodwin of State put enough
balls through the hoop to give him
fifteen points and high point honors.
Captain Pritchett, of Davidson, recov-
ered his eye for the basket which he
had lost in the game with Carolina and
put in ten points to lead the Wild-
cat's scoring.

Early Practice Gives Bright
Prospects for Season

This week saw regular baseball
practice begin and every day there
has been a light practice. Setting-up
exercises for 15 minutes to loosen up
stiff muscles, then pep games, followed
by a short infield practice, then two
laps around the track. The pitchers
are using the Fungo to loosen up their
arm and shoulder muscles, while the
outfielders are snagging flies.

Next Wednesday Younger will start
batting practice, then will come the
grind until the first game which comes
on March 22 with Oak Ridge. There
is some possibility of getting a game
on March 21 with Oak but
nothing definite yet.

The team takes a Virginia trip this
year as heretofore, and will play such
schools as V. M. I. (two games),
Washington and Lee, V. P. I., and the
Univer§ity of Virginia. Games are
also scheduled with Springfield ( Mass.)
College at Davidson, and Cornell Uni-
versity at Greensboro, Oglethorpe Col-
lege (Atlanta) at Davidson, and the
schools of this state.

Final Half Rough and Slow

Wake Forest’s Deacons proved to

Wildcats and the Baptists were forced
to swallow another defeat in the Big
by the count of 38 to 25. A
fairly large crowd of fans witnessed
the clash which was played in the
localogymnasium Wednesday night the
13th.

For a few minutes the visitors played
the Cats on more or less equal terms,
and half way through the first period
the count was knotted at 10 all. The
Wildcats, who had played sluggishly
up to this point took on new life and
began to show a few baskets for their
care, Pritchett was doing some nice
shooting.

The close guarding of the
Baptists kept the ball away from the
goal a good part of the time, but, at
odd moments, some red jersey would
streak down the floor to sink a crip
shot, and tactics like this allowed the
jungaleers lead the Deacons
some eleven points at half time.

The final half was slow and rough,
lacking any element of the spectacu-
lar. Scarboro’s eye for the hoop kept
his team in respectable distance, but
the Wildeat's lead was never threat-
ened,

Captain Pritchett lead his team with
twelve points, but he was matched by
the Baptist’s big gun, Scarboro, who
also piled up an even dozen markers.

Cadets Bow to Count of 20-10

Friday, February 21, saw the Fresh-
men from Davidson trounce some in-
vading cadets from Oak Ridge Insti-
tute by a score of twenty to ten. The
Davidson grapplers showed up well,
losing only two matches and one of
them due to an injury to White. Con-

man before the latter knew what was
going on. Humphreys had a fairly
easy time getting a time advantage on
his man and was nevérfMin danger.
Houston and Christeitbury, T25 and 135

White was wrestling in the hundred

from the match. McKinney and Raker
