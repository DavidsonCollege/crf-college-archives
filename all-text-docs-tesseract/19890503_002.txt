D.C. SOLD TON.Y.
DEVELOPER!

By NUV O. REESH
Donald Trump purchased Davidson

College in an unprecedented takeover late
last week for a price of $150 million. The

college’s name will be changed, effective immediately, to Trump University.
According to college president John Kuykendall, Trump’s offer both surprised and
pleased the board of trustees. “The trustees plan to spend the next two months purchasing

diamonds in Sun City, South Africa,” he said.
Kuykendall plans to stay on as president of Trump University, but will, bluntly, be a Trump puppet. “It’s
really not unlike the role I’ve played these last few years,” Kuykendall said.

Trump’s interest in Davidson
came as a fluke, he says. “I noticed
Davidson’s potential while flying
over the town in my $10 million
French Pumahelicopter onthe way
to my resort home in Florida.”
According to Trump’s lawyers, the
high economic status of most
Davidson students provoked him
to open negotiations.

“Once I saw the abundance of
Jaguars and BMWs as well as
students’ willingness to pay
$15,000 annual tuition and fees, I
knew I’d come home,” avowed
Trump.

Trump opened negotiations
last Friday at the quarterly trustee
meeting. It was decided that Trump
could relieve the college of its
fundraising burden by donating
$150 million to the trustees and

assuming responsibility for the
operation of the college.

According to trustee secretary
Larry Dagenhart, the trustees were
initially divided on the selling the
college because of Trump’s
questionable integrity. After anight
of negotiations, capped by a
mystical vision by Trustee
President Craig Wall after eating
the tequila worm, all parties
reached a compromise.

The trustees set certain
conditions and sold the college.

“Namely,” Dagenhart said,
“Trump is to continue in
Davidson’ s cherished Presbyterian
tradition.” Trump was ordained late
last night in the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church. To
commemorate the event, Trump
plans to havea large mural painted
across the church’s front. “I like
thinking big,” he said in an
exclusive interview. “If you’re
going to be thinking anyway, you
might as well think big.”

Trump plans to accomplish

several goals as Trump
University’s chief officer. After
renovating Chambers building for
his personal residence, Trump will
annex __ the
towns of
Davidson and
Cornelius. in
order to erect
n e Ww
classrooms
a n d
administrative
offices. The
satellite
parking lot will
become a
private landing strip for Trump’s
personal jet.

Inplace of SAT scores, Trump
plans to admit students on the basis
of yearly parental income. Only

those making $250,000 and above
will be considered for admission
to Trump University. Financial aid
will be abolished. :

“Tlike thinking big,”
he says. “If you’re
going to be thinking
anyway, you mightas
well think big.”

“T plan to instill my capitalist
wealth ethic as well as continue the
Presbyterian values of the former
institution,” said Trump. “It’sreally
not a bad mix.”

will modify
O design!

Many students were relieved to find out that Donald Trump’s takeover

of Davidson will not erase all the progress the institution has made of late.
The most significant improvement in the last year, according to administration sources,
has been the institution of a new college logo.

After studying the five-figure concept at which administrators arrived earlier this year, Trump and his
lawyers decided to retain the design with a few modifications..

One option for the logo that
administrators had somehow
ignored—one that Trump plans to
implement immediately—was
painting iton the roof of Chambers
building in 50-foot high letters. “I
like thinking big,” Trump said. “If
you’re going to be thinking
anyway, you might.as well think
big.”

TRUMP

Student reaction to Donald Trump’s takeover of Davidson College was
somewhat mixed. Students gathered for hours beforehand in Johnston
Gymandin the football field bleachersto hear the important announcement

yesterday. When the word finally came, pandemonium broke out.
“Ding, dong, the witch is dead,” sang many of them inexplicably. Trump, who made the
statement to students in the gym, waved and smiled to the crowd until an unidentified student

This chant was repeated for fifteen minutes while the shaky
Trump regained his wits. Finally, SGA president Tripp Helms offered

Will Terry’s secret police force, fired
several shots at him. Then Trump
stopped waving and smiling to the
crowd.

The would-be assassin, captured in
the above photo by*crack David’s Onion
photographers, then bolted from the room.
He remains at large.

When the students recovered from
the shock of virtually having witnessed a
brutal, bloody killing right in front of their
very own eyes, they began chanting, “Wave
