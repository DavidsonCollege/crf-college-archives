PCC proposes new alcohol policy to court houses

By TREEBY WILLIAMSON

With an emphasis on keeping
Davidson students safe while
maintaining the atmosphere of
present Davidson parties, the Pat-
terson Court Council presented its
newly established alcohol policy
to the houses of Patterson Court
this week. If passed by three-quar-
ters of the houses, with a two-
thirds majority ‘1 each house, the
policy will go into effect fall term.

The policy requires the estab-
lishment of a designated service
area to be entered only by persons
21 years of age or older. This area
must be a room separate from the
social function. In order to enter
this designated area, proper proof
of ID in the form of a Davidson
ID, driver’s licence, or passport
must be presented in order to re-
ceive a stamp of eligibility.

Bartenders who will not con-
sume alcohol will regulate the dis-
tribution of alcohol. Containers
can be no larger than 20 ounces,
and there will be no service to
those already obviously intoxi-
cated. In addition, 25 percent of
the “common cost of the alcoholic
beverages shall be spent on food
and alternate beverages.” Drink-
ing games or contests cannot be

scheduled as social functions.

In an effort to prevent drunk
driving, the PCC will provide
funds to finance ten additional
hours of campus security on the
Court. However, the month of
September will serve as an educa-
tional period. During this time,
students stopped for driving into-
xicated will receive only a warn-
ing. Safe transportation must be
available at any house-sponsored
event taking place away from the
campus. Mandatory house meet-
ings to educate members about the
Davidson College policy and
North Carolina state laws is re-
quired during the first three weeks
of fall term.

An Enforcement Council con-
sisting of one acting social chair-
man from each house and two
PCC members is also proposed.
The council will be chaired by the
non-voting PCC president. A non-
voting secretary will also be
elected. The purpose of the En-
forcement Council is to try sus-
pected violators of the policy.
Anybody can report a suspected
violation if its is reported within
seven days of observation to the
Secretary of the Enforcement
Council. The member of the Pat-
terson Court house under charge

‘Trustees meet

By NELLE MCCORKLE

The Board of Trustees con-
vened last Thursday and Friday on
campus for their bi-annual meet-
ing.

The board named Robert C.
Williams vice president for
academic affairs and dean of the
faculty at the meeting. Williams,
currently dean of University Col-
lege at Washington University in
St. Louis, assumes the position
Aug. |.

The trustees also approved the
college Alcohol Policy pending
review by the Patterson Court
Council. According to SGA Presi-
dent Mark Sandy: “The most im-
portant aspect of the Alcohol Pol-
icy is that it’s going to put a lot of
responsibility on the students,
which is where I think the respon-

sibility should lie. Students are
going to determine whether it
works or not. The school comes
up with an overall policy, and then
Patterson Court comes up with a
specific policy.”

Vice President of Academic
Affairs and Dean of the Faculty
Price Zimmermann and President
John Kuykendall recommended
the following faculty promotions
approved by the trustees; Edmund
Palmer in psychology, Felix Car-
roll Jr. in chemistry, and Merlyn
Schuh in chemistry were named
professors; Wolfgang Christian in
physics, Peter Hess in economics,
Cynthia Lewis in English, and
Homer Sutton in French were de-
clared associate professors; and
Robin Barnes in history, Chris-
tian, Hess, Lewis, and Sutton re-

will then be presented with a for-
mal statement of charges along
with a definite date, place, and
time for a closed hearing within
seven days of the date of service of
the formal statement of charges.

In the hearing, the president of
the house under review and the
Enforcement Council member of
that house will represent their
house. The charged individual has
the right to request anonymity.
After a formal statement of
charges and a presentation of wit-
nesses on both sides, the Enforce-
ment Council may ask questions
before it moves into its executive
session.

In the executive session if a
violation is found to occur (by a
two-thirds majority of the voting
committee), then a sanction will
be imposed (also to be approved
by two-thirds vote) upon the
house. Sanctions range from
warnings to fines of $100 (to the
PCC by the house in violation) to
social probations of either one or
two weeks (in addition to fines of
$200 and $400 respectively) to so-
cial probation for a period of time
determined by the Enforcement
Council.

The Enforcement Council, ac-

ceived tenure. The trustees ap-
proved L. Richardson King as

Richardson Professor of
mathematics.
The trustees recetved the

Committee to Review the Current
Status of Women’s Athletics re-
port. Athletic Director Kit Morris
said: “A strong Policy Committee
of the Board of Trustees and at the
full board meeting was the issue of
women’s athletics. I feel certain
that it will be a topic of future dis-
cussion, particularly when the
Athletic Policy Committee meets
again. Many of the recommenda-
tions included in the committee
report fall within my ability to re-
spond by the use of discretionary
powers within the department.”

cording to PCC President Fran
Houck, was established in order to
‘preserve unity and equity among
the court houses. With the new al-
cohol policy, such enforcement is
essential in order to maintain a
sense of fairness.” The prosecu-
tion of violators is extremely im-
portant, and it is up to the David-
son students’ responsibility to re-
port violations if they want the al-
cohol policy to remain effective.

In addition, the PCC recom-
mended seven administrative ac-
tions to facilitate the effectiveness
of the policy. The suggestions
asked for later hours for the Union
Cafe on Thursday, Friday, Satur-
day nights (open until 3 a.m.) in
order to avoid drunk driving to
Ham ’n Eggs or 7-11. Vending
machines in more convenient lo-
cations to Patterson Court parties
were also requested as well as al-
lowing houses to hold formals in
Vail Commons without mandat-
ory meals or in another appropri-
ate on-campus facility.

As to the fall implementation
of these and the other seven rec-
ommended administrative ac-
tions, PCC member Brett Flin-
chum was not overly optimistic.
However, he added, “if the Court

adheres to the policy this fall, our
chances of receiving these bene-
fits would be much greater.”

It is important to note that the
Patterson Court Alcohol Policy is
separate from th: policy of the
college itself. The Davidson Col-
lege Alcohol Policy hi. a provi-
sion which allows Patterson Court
to establish its own policy. The
purpose of this action was to re-
lease the college from any legal
responsibility to Patterson Court
parties as well as allow PCC mem-
bers educate themselves about al-
cohol laws and policy in the pro-
cess.

The policy, if passed, will be
reviewed and revised if necessary
at the end of fall term 1986. The
policy will be reviewed annually
by the PCC and then approved by
three-fourths of the active houses
on Patterson Court by a two-thirds
vote within each house.

As Houck has said, though the
policy is not totally in confor-
mance with North Carolina State
Alcohol Laws, its main purpose is
to prevent drunk driving and en-
courage responsible drinking
while at the same time maintain-
ing the spirit of equality and com-
munity on Patterson Court.
