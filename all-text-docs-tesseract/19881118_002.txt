Friday, November 18, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN

MAKONNEN, from page I
EN

chael worked as a counselor-mentor
in the Love of Learning program for
minority high school students. His
two summers of work with the pro-
gram profoundly effected the lives
of the students he came in contact
with.

One senior in the program who
knew Michael writes: “Mike did
more than counsel. He gave freely of
himself. Infinitely patient and un-
derstanding, he was there for us
when we’d go to him, sometimes
tearfully, with our problems. But he
did more than give advice-he probed

our minds to help us find our own answers.
He was a true optimist, intent on helping us
focus on the brighter side of everything.
Even his mere presence was comforting.”
_ As a resident adviser at Davidson, Mi-
chael was “thoughtful, caring, and very
knowledgeable about Davidson,” accord-
ing to Director of Residence Life Tom
Jennings. “He was an idea man, a real
involved student.”

Makonnen was a member of PIKA and
BSC, and he was involved with interna-
tional student programs on campus.

Makonnen, 22, was a native of Ethopia.
When civil war broke out in Ethopia, some
of his relatives were assassinated and
threats were made on his family because

Michael was nine years old, his father sent
the family to Sweden to live with his
mother while he remained in the country.

Being in a life-threatening situation in
Ethopia, along with the responsibility for
the family accorded him by Ethopian cul-
ture as the oldest male in his father’s ab-
sence, forced Michael to “become a man,
to put away childish things and be con-
cerned for his family,” says Assistant
Chaplain Brenda Tapia. —

His experience with adversity at an early
age produced in Michael a “sense of
strength,” says Tapia, which he exhibited
throughout the year he was dealing with his
cancer.

Michael’s strength and will to live as
long as he could “inspired us all to work

harder and to appreciate life even
more,” says one of his fellow coun-
selor-mentors in the Love of Learn-
ing program.

Countless Davidson suderte: fac-
ulty, staff, adminstrators, and mem-
bers of the college community, and
high school students involved. with .
Love of Learning were.touched and
inspired by Michael Makonnen.

One of these high school students
writes, “His determination, will to ..
live, belief and faith in God, and his
attitude of taking one day at a time
assisted him in bearing his tremen-
dous burden and changed the lives of
everyone with whom he has come in
contact.” .

Open Forum continues weekday party discussion

By PETER BYNUM

Students and administrators
discussed the problems associ-
ated with week-night parties in an
Open Forum Monday. night.
About 100 students attended the
forum held in the 900 Room. The
only faculty.and administrators in
attendance were on the panel.

The forum was sponsored by
the SGA, and the panel consisted
of Senior Class President ‘Hap

Bryant, Patterson Court ‘Councif

President Eileen Keeley, Profes-

sor of Religion Tygnt Foley, Di- .

rector of Residence Life Tom
Jennings, Dean of Students Will
’ Terry, and Freshman Class Sena-
tor Scott Taliaferro. SGA Presi-
dent Harrison S. Murray served as
., ‘the moderator. ¥
The meeting began with an
observation by. Residence Life
Director Tom Jennings that the
actual number of week-night par-
. ties has decreased noticeably
since the freshman year of. the
current senior class, However,
faculty and administration con-
cem seems to lie in what Profes-
sor Trent Foley referred to as a
. “party mentality” and an apparent
“dichotomy” between academic

and social life at Davidson.

Foley, speaking from his own
point of view, feels that the nature
of parties on Patterson Court
causes academics to be “some-
thing ‘to be endured rather than
engaged” and no longer “stirs
people’s passions.”

Terry, while claiming no inten-
tion to restrict parties during the
week, dislikes the emphasis
placed on them. “The thing’ that

-bothers me,” he said, “is the

length of the parties, not the fact
of them.”

Terry also worries that noise
from. residence hall and Court
parties cuts down on quiet places

‘to study on campus.

Jennings and Terry agreed that
weekday parties are not always
good for academic pursuits, but
that efforts to curb them would be,
as Terry said, “a victory for Sa-
tan.”

The conversation digressed

from the effects of late night par-

ties and alcohol consumption on
‘grades toa discussion of problems
with faculty and student relations,
specifically the lack of creative

interaction between the two’

groups.

Several people voiced the opin-
ion that more personal exchanges
between professors and class
members, in the form of faculty
mixers or after-supper conversa-
tions, would not only alleviate
academic apathy but‘also help to

’ increase creativity.

Bryant felt that the lack of crea-
tive activities, academic and so-
cial, stems from the heavy
Davidson work load. Terry

agreed with Bryant, pointing outa

tendency to “equate excellence

with quantity.” Foley blamed the
problem on an overemphasized
“Calvinistic work ethic.”

The concensus of the panel
seemed to be that great progress
has been made to reduce the ad-
verse effects of weekday parties.
Nevertheless, people also felt that
students need to be held account-
able for their actions at these

functions. Terry urged the student
body to send a message to the
faculty to force students to “live
up to the same standards” that
everyone, partiers and non-parti-
ers, try to uphold.

Terry called for students to
realize the need to address this
issue and hopes that students will
resolve among themselves. He
said, “I would much rather they
did it than anyone else.”

redialing a busy number until the
line is free: In order to use this
feature, after receiving a busy
signal the student should depress
the switchhook and listen for the
dial tone. Then, dial #78 and lis-
ten for the confirmation tone (2
short signals) and hang up.
When the line is free, the phone
will ring three times. The student

should pick up the phone, listen’

for ringing, and wait for the called
party to answer. Both the caller
and the called party must be avail-
able within 30 minutes or the
request will be cancelled.

Because there were not enough
outgoing ong distance lines
available to students during peak
hours, additional lines have been
added. According to Director of
Administrative Services Bob
Stephenson, a traffic study by

Southern Bell indicates that the.

additional sig Should be ade-
quate.
Stephenson notes that ‘many
students unfamiliar with the area
have been using their seven digit
personal access codes to place
calls to Charlotte and Mooresvile
exchanges. These call are local
and can be made without charge;
however, if the code is used stu-
dents will be charged for them.

in order,”

When asked if he felt there is a
particular party or organization
that is making substantial prog-
ress in civil rights today, Scales
offered some general advice, and
what organization to join and al-
low “your conscience to decide.”

Scales’ advice is to “bea negro
lover, be a do-gooder, and be a
bleeding heart.” Scales said that
Jesus is the ultimate bleeding
heart, and while the principles in
the Gospels might be too hard to
live up to, at least “we should try.”
