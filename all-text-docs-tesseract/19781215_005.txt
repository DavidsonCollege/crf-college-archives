Student debates College's ‘Christian atrn

To the Editor:

This is in yeply to the letter
from Ms. and Mr. Oliver, pub-
lished last week in The David-
sonian, in which the Olivers
praised the “Christian atmos-
phere”’ of Davidson College.

es other reasons for
replying, I to correct this
inaccurate/limited and frankly

view of the ‘col-
jege community.

_ “It is probably true that the ©

ion of a close, warm,
Christian climate of intellectual
inquiry is a public image that
certain portions of the school
actively present; thus the Oli-
vers were perhaps honestly
deceived. However, it is not the
case that Davidson College does
in fact maintain any sort of
“Christian atmosphere” in its
pursuit of ‘‘intellectual inqui-
ry + '

Indeed the notion that ‘free
intellectual inquiry and high
academic reputation” could oc-
cur within the bounds of Chris-
tianity is contradictory, be-
cause it places dogmatic arbi-
trary restrictions on such pur-
suit. F

I count myself fortunate to
have been exposed, at David-
son, to intellectual tools which
empower me to move beyond a
moral and ethical code written
by and for a society which no
longer exists. (This is. not. to
disparage Christianity as such,
The Bible is relevant still. in
some ways; but so are other
books as well.) Indeed one of
the most powerful of these tools
comes from within the Religion
department itself in the form of »
the excellent Modern: ‘Criticisins
of Religion ‘Course.

Were it the ‘cage. that David:
son professors were bound by
Christian ideals it could not be
true that, e.g:;'a professor ar-

Life has changed for students abroad

To the Editor:

It was just a few weeks ago
that a friend wrote to me
expressing concern .that. I had
“been lost to the life of a cosmo-
politan world traveler.”

This called for a reply not
only to my friend/friends but
also to all. you Davidsonians
who are wondering what has
become of the fourteen or so
students spending their junior
year abroad in Montpellier.

As to whether or not I have
been ‘‘lost,” it is difficult to
say. I will in any case probably
return to Davidson next year as
a Senior, This year I am
spending abroad is, I think,
going to be one of the most

Opinion
Reflections for the holidays

Men who receive appoint-

.: ments to the United. States.

Supreme Court usually become
‘ehanged individuals, taking
their lifetime appointments |
very seriously. They are selec-
ted not so much for what they —
have done in the past, but for |
what they can be expected to
achieve in the future. :
Anwar Sadat and Menachem
Begin huve received a similar
charge. These two men are
neighbors who do not. want their
grandsons to grow up shooting
at- one another. They are also —
joint winners of the 1978 ‘Peace
Prize. The boys at Nobel selec-
ted them for what they can be .

“expected to accomplish for the

cause of world peace. God bless
them. .

One final idea is in my mind.

things to think about. I am
