The Real Game

By CAROLINE HAUSER

Contrary to popular belief, the biggest sport- >

ing event on campus this weekend was not the
lacrosse match.

No, before Davidson saluted the dedica-
tion of its seniors, it braced for an even more
intense battle of skill and stamina.

Decision Davidson.

For a day-long affair challenged in endur-
ance only by the Ironman, families raced
from lectures to lunch, from department fairs
to activities fairs in less than fair weather.

Mothers jockied for position, wearing the
regulation mother uniform—capris and car-
digan twinsets. Fathers coached from the
sidelines, “Let’s meet him; shake her hand.”
Prospective students guzzled pink lemonade
like Powerade and gave it their best.

In the seventeen-year old’s world, the col-
lege selection process has become the equiva-
lent of The Great Race. Driving and flying
across the country like the big-money recruits

they are, holding out for the best contract.

And these aren’t even the new athletes.

In an unregulated draft like Decision
Davidson, though, it’s hard to distinguish
between the good, the bad, and the clumsy.

Here, all the draftees are presidents and
captains, editors and quarterbacks,
overachieves and...overachievers.

One kid, heading for a social action club’s
booth, was intercepted by his father, and
herdered towards the club sports table. Some-
thing about competition.

But isn’t everything?

place showing at Furman

Davidson’s women’s track team raced to
an incredible second-place finish at the
Furman Invitational on Saturday.

Furman, Davidson, The Citadel, and
Wofford met in Greenville, SC, for the last
meet of the regular season. Host Furman won
the meet convincingly with 218 points. The
Wildcats managed 107, leading the Citadel

and Wofford, with 97 and 54 points, respec-

tively.

Laura Puckett ’04 won the 3000-meter run
in 10:40.49, now her season best time. Also
posting season best performances were Kate
Wilson in the 200-meter dash, Clarissa Carr
in the 400m, Liz Gross in the 800m, and
Sarah Baxter in the 1500-meter run.

According to Wilson, who finished second
in the 200-meters, “The team did very well
overall. We accomplished our goals for this
meet, which was against three other schools
in our conference. I think we all feel really
prepared for the final challenge of the sea-
son.”

Having finished their 2002 season, the track
and field team is looking forward to the
Southern Conference Championships in

Johnson City, TN

“We've trained hard all year,” said Wilson,
“and although we've had some injuries and
other hindrances, we've improved our times
and are really excited for the conference
meet.”

netted the team’s third goal off an assist from
Seaton at the 2:53 mark.

Vanderbilt eventually got a goal on the
board, but the Wildcats quickly responded as
Seaton assisted senior Christin Raimondo to
make the score 4-1 in favor of Davidson.

The Wildcat defense, which played a solid
game throughout, kept the Commodore of-
fense scoreless for the next six minutes.

Senior Sarah Otto scored her first goal of
the game at the 13:20 mark.

It took another 13 minutes for another

Davidson goal, but Sarah Otto came up with _

a great pass to freshman Lindsay Frank to put

off a pass from Liz Drennan.

Raimondo scored a goal for the Wildcats at
52:55, but Davidson was never able to get the
tying goal.

“I thought we played with a lot of heart and
intensity,” said Davidson head coach Mary
Schwartz.

“We showed this aftemoon that we can play
with anyone in the country and while it was a
difficult loss that will hopefully give us some
momentum for our final four games.”

The Wildcats hit the road for their final
four games.

All four of the final contests will be Ameri-
can Lacrosse Conference games with the first
coming April 19 at Penn State at 4:00.
