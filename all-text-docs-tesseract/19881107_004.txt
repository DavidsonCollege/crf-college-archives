‘Every trumpet player’s god”

By VIRGINIA MISCHEN

By sheer luck pp icson hooked
one of the world’s'most renowned
musicians for a major concert last
Saturday night. Union concert
committee chairman Matt Terrell
said that Wynton Marsalis “fell
right into our laps.”

“We were aiming for his
brother Branford, a saxophonist.
Then our booking agent told us
that Wynton had a few nights off
between dates and wanted to play
another concert. He offered us a
price, and we booked him.”

The Wall Street Journal calls
Marsalis “the most self-disci-
plined jazzman in the history of
that volcanic art.” Freshman
trumpeter John Burns Says he is
“every trumpet player’s god:”

With a resumé that includes
study at the Julliard School, five
albums and six Grammy awards,
Marsalis is considered by experts
to be the greatest trumpet player

in the world.

Terrell took some informal stu-
dent surveys before he decided to
book Marsalis. The response was
extremely enthusiastic. Terrell
was pleased because as concert
chairman, he wants to bring dif-
ferent kinds of acts to the campus.
“Davidson hasn’t had much expo-
sure to jazz,” he said.

The concert committee works
through a booking agent in Char-
lotte to get major acts like Mar-
salis to perform here.

Union program coordinator
Ruth Pittard said, “Agents like
Davidson because we treat artists
well. Responsive audiences at-
tend our concerts, and we have the
ability to arrange dates in a lim-
ited amount of time. Therefore,
we can usually negotiate to get
someone for the least possible
amount of money.”

Pittard was excited about the
Marsalis concert, but is disap-

pointed that Davidson is unable to
attract such a major act more of-
ten.

“Artists used to want to play at
colleges first, so we used to attract
the big musicians. We even

turned down Simon and Gar-
funkel before they became fa-
mous because we didn’t think
they were good enough! Now art-
ists want to start at the top--clubs
and big universities. They de-

mand more money than we can
afford to pay.”

According to Terrell, Marsalis
is definitely the biggest name to
come to Davidson in the past few

years. >

Habitat for Humanity project rises up in Davidson

By TRENT STEVENS

Canned goods and turkeys are
some of the charitable contribu-
tions that have been distributed to
Davidson’s poor families in the
past. But how would you like to
work with families to build their
own houses? Davidson Habitat
for Humanity is doing just that on
Potts Street.

The Davidson project started a
few years ago when a Steering
committee was formed to deter-
mine if there was a need for low-
cost housing in Davidson. When
the need was discovered, the
committee tried to become an
affiliate of International Habitat
for Humanity, an Americus,
Georgia based organization
founded by former businessman

Millard Fuller. However, the or-
ganization felt that Davidson was
too small and that there was nei-
ther enough poverty nor enough
wealth to sustain a project here.
So the committee decided to
start its own project, but it also
planned to follow the same gen-
eral guidelines of the Americus
organization. Fundraising  at-
tempts brought in enough money
to purchase enough land for
eleven housing plots.
’ This tenacity apparently paid
off, because according to Ken
Wood, Careers Office Director
and vice-president of Davidson
Habitat for Humanity’s volunteer
board of directors, “We got the
attention of Americus. Americus
came back and said, ‘Maybe you

folks are special. We'll make an
exception for Davidson and we’d
like to have you.’” Although
Davidson officially became an
affiliate last May, the. project
remains independently controlled
and funded.

The Davidson Habitat for
Humanity is funded in several
ways. Each family, which must be
approved by a selection commit-
tee to receive Habitat housing,
receives an interest-free mort-
gage for roughly $30,000 that is
repaid in monthly installments of
under $200 each.

Each family that receives a

house is required to put in 200.

hours of “sweat equity”: 100
hours of work on their own house
and100 hours of work on another

family’s house. The money re-
ceived from the families is used to
build other Habitat houses, and
ten percent of the money raised
goes toward a Habitat for Human-
ity housing development in Gua-

_ temala, where one house is built

for every one built here. Outside
donations of materials and funds
cover some of the other expenses.
Caroline Craig, who is the col-
lege’s service coordinator and the
Davidson. Habitat’s volunteer

coordinator, serves as the chief

organizer of the Habitat’s volun-
teer activities, which are free. She
says that “Habitat for Humanity
has been chosen as one of two
(programs affiliated with the col-
lege) for this year. That means
that it has official status as a proj-

ect that members of the college
community will participate in and
volunteer in as is possible and that
I will invest a significant amount
of my time as an employee of the
college, to facilitate that volun-
teer effort.”

To those who are most dedi-
cated to the project, perhaps the
most striking thing about the proj-
ect is the cooperation and fellow-
ship of all involved. Political sci-
ence professor Tom Kazee, says,
“It’s time consuming, but of all of
the things around town that I
might have gotten involved in, in
terms of community service, this
is about as rewarding as it gets

Verdie Barringer says that “if you go in
with a smile on your face, people start
wanting to have a smile on their face.” The
comment is typical -- it’s her attitude to-
wards life. Anytime you see her around the
Union she has a big grin on her face.

Barringer sees her job not just as keeping

the Union clean, but also as a chance to get
' to know students. She approaches them
with a pleasant comment and asks about
their majors to get them to tell her about
themselves. She said one of the reasons she
works at the Union is that it gives her the
chance to talk.

“That’s why I like cleaning; it gives me
close contact, working with people.” She
especially likes to hear about other places
and other experiences. “I would love to go
all over the world. I like to hear students
talk about all the different places they’ ve
been--it’s just amazing.” 4

She has a sincere respect for Davidson
students. “Not one of.the students has
shown me that they’re not adults.” There
are things students can do to make her job

easier, however.

“During the night, they could pick up
their cans and trays, and put them in the
proper places. And the marks on the wall--
you only find small children doing things
like that. But I guess everyone gets de-
pressed sometimes. Depression can put
you out of focus right quickly. If you try to
keep things clean, though, people will see it
and try to follow your example.”

One of the reasons Barringer identifies
with students so well is that she has been a
college student herself. She studied at N.C.
State for two years. To pay for her.educa-
tion, she worked in a restaurant annex, its
hours being the only ones that fit into her
schedule. Now that she has a family and it
is her first priority, she isn’t interested in
continuing her education right away. “I’m
not ready to go back to school. The timing
isn’t right. I’ve gathered a lot of informa-
tion by not going back to school.”

Although it is hard for her to manage
having a family and a job, Barringer enjoys

it. “When I get up early in the morning, I..

have to keep stress and depression away.
I’ve got three little ones and two teenagers,

and I try to put forth the effort to make their
days a little brighter.” But she emphasizes
discipline, too. “As a career woman, you
have to lay down laws along with the man
of the house to make decisions.”

Barringer thinks spending time away
from the children is good both for herself
and for their sense of independence. “We
all get a little tired of hearing the baby cry.
An outing now and then is good. Some-
times for about two hours you need to get
away from the baby and relax. Otherwise,
the only thing the baby sees is herself, and
when she gets older and goes out into the
world that attitude can cause an awful lot of
problems.”

Barringer is a giving person, and strong
at the same time. “I think the staff is here to
serve people. The customer is always right,
and students are my customers. I don’t
want them to take advantage of me,
though.” Her kindness is illustrated by the
way she responds to people in trouble. She
says that things usually work out well. -

She describes a trip back from a previous
assembly-line job: “It was marvelous--

front of the car. Being a woman, I know I

‘shouldn’t take chances, stranded so far

away. -

“But there was this one time when I saw
a lady with a little baby, and her car had
stopped. She had been walking along the
highway for abouta half a mile and I picked
her up. I wouldn’t have done it normally,

but something said go ahead--well, it turns *

out that some of my people knew her.”
