P2100 BANK
7 AND TRUST COMPANY

A Message to the Davidson College Students:
Recently Piedmont Bank .and Trust revised their
procedures for computing checking account-—service

directed at the Davidson College students. We believe
the new procedure to be fair in that the charges relate
to the amount of activity and is offset or reduced by the
balance maintained.

‘For years, banks have been offering checking
accounts at little or no cost to the consumer, at an
average cost to banks of $50.00 to $60.00: per account
per year. Now it appears that most banks will be
undergoing pricing changes not unlike Piedmont’s.

Since 1916, we at Piedmont Bank and Trust
Company have been serving the Davidson community
and we feel that the community has been well served.
To our knowledge Piedmont is the only bank in North
Carolina (or in the world) that automatically approves
Master Charge applications for college students—whe-
ther or not the Davidson student has a credit history.
Piedmont’s Student Advisory Board meets regularly
with bank officials to determine how the bank can
better serve the students. You probably know John
Jackson, Paul Bradley, Tim Goodell, and Diana Pierce.
We value their judgement and appreciate their. input.

Piedmont is a friendly, independent bank offering
personalized service convenient to the campus. We
believe the Davidson student. will derive numerous

‘ benefits from his Piedmont Bank checking account and
Master Charge prograrh for relatively little cost.

Sincerely,

Piedmont Bank and Trust Company

The Davidson swimmers are having a fine seneon 20 far this winter. The Cats beat Augusta

The, Lady Cagers have been
busy since classes began Janu-
ary 8. In the last week and a
half, the Cats have played four
games with one more scheduled
against UNC-Greensboro before
the week-is out.

The first of these games was a
90-43 pounding at the hands of
UNCC. The second was a 56-55
squeaker against Wingate. The
Cats lost on a bad pass and a
steal with five seconds left. The
third was played here in John-
ston Gym. Despite a vociferous
crowd, Wagneer’s good outside
shooting allowed them to pull
out an easy 73-50 win. David-
son’s record dropped to 1-6.

The game Monday against
Meredith provided the highlight
of the new year. Despite three
girls fouling out, they managed
to pull out a 59-54 victory.

“Defense won that game for
us,’’ explained Coach Susan
Roberts.

“We were able to force some
turnevers near the end of the
game,” she added. :

Although the Cats are 2-6 for
the season, they are 2-2 in their
conference, and Roberts is opti-
mistic. ‘‘We've played well late-

ly. The girls came back ‘early.

and worked hard. We're better
as a team and there’s been good
individual improvement.” .

weekend when they swim a-
gainst Old Dominion University
at 4 pm Friday ‘afternoon and
against James Madison Univer-
sity at 11:30 Saturday morning.
Both meets will be at the UNCC
gym.

“~The swim team raised its

record to 4-0 last weekend with
victories in dual meets with
Augusta and Furman. Against
Augusta, Davidson placed first
in all but one of the swimming
events. Mark Tommerdahl set a

: Davidson pool record of 2:02.26

in the 200 meter butterfly, and

Paul Voight set a Davidson |
record of 48.39 seconds in the

100 meter freestyle.

.Both- Tommerdahl and
Voight won two events in the
Furman meet—Tommerdahl
besting the field in the 1000
meter freestyle and the 200
meter butterfly, and Voight
taking the 50 meter and 100
meter freestyle.

One reason for Davidson’s
excellent showing so far this
year is the amazing recruiting
year Davidson had last year.
The swimming team is young,
but good. Freshmen comprise
half of the team.

Coach Pat Miller said, ‘‘The
team swam well coming off the

long yardage in Florida where _

they practiced over the holi-
days. With continued hard
work, the times should continue
to drop throughout the season.”’

The swim team spent the

week of December 30 to Jan-’

uary 6 in St. Petersburg, Flor-
ida, preparing for this season.
Each swimmer swam about
15,000 yards a day.

Davidson finished fourth last

year in the Southern Conference
swim meet and is looking for a
better finish this year.
