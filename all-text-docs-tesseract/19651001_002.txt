FRIDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1965

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

Suicide Attempt

We were downright amazed at the
temerity of the Interfraternity Council
this week in prohibiting freshmen con-
tact with fraternity men in any dormi-
tory through practically the remain-
der of this semester.

The impractical nature of such a
restriction must be obvious to any-
one who has had any experience with
the situation of the Davidson fresh-
men. “It’s easier said than done.

The change evidently was brought
about after a “dirty rush” charge was
lodged against. one fraternity at the
IFC meeting Monday night. Despite
the reported lack of specific evidence
to support the “dirty rush” charge,
the IFC proceeded to adopt the re-
vision which, in effect, bans fraternity
men from entering a freshmen dorm-
itory at any time, and vice versa, pro-
hibits freshmen from entering an up-
perclass dorm before Jan. 3, 1966. .

An “explanation” of the new rush
regulations was supposed to take
place at the freshmen chapel Wednes-
day, but we would hardly call a simple
reading of the regulations an — ex-
planation.” A subsequent question
and answer session made a near com-
edy of the new regulations.

After the assembly we overheard
one freshman remark candidly to an-
other, “Well, if this is the way the
fraternities run things, . . .” Doubt-
less more than one member of the
Class of 1969 shares the same opinion.

We find it hard to believe that the
Greeks are selling their system down-
hill with such stipulations. Yet with
the rules approved Monday night by
the IFC, we have our doubts.

Let us look at a few situations that
ould very easily arise: ;

° w Sixty niner is having trouble with
a couple of calculus problems on the
night before a writ. Even if he were
to seek out an Independent upper-
classman, he must risk having “con-
tact” with a fraternity man. in the
dorm. Or what if Eta Beta Pi wants
to check with sixty-niner about the
same problem?

—Perhaps one Greek has a mes-
sage for another Greek who is a hall
counselor. Must he trot all the way
to the house to call back up to the
dormitory which is beside his?

—Sixty-niner may want a ride home
with Greek on Saturday. How is he
to get in touch. with the upperclass-
-man?

—A freshman may need to contact
an officer of a campus organization
who just happens to be a fraternitv
man. Or he may need to check with
a DAVIDSONIAN staff editor about an
article. Under the existing rules he
might as well give up._ ;

Ironically the situation which
prompted the “dirty rush” charge—
where two freshmen are rooming on
the normally upperclass second floor
of Watts dorm—is confused even more
by the new regulation. As to just
what constitutes “upperclass contact”
in any dorm no one seems able to say.

Other very practical situations have
been raised, many of which the IFC
should have foreseen before they
jumped headlong into the revision this
week. It seems that some note of
practicality could have been sounded
during the IFC’s three-hour session
Monday night.

Perhaps on the other hand, fresh-
men are getting a true picture of how
rash fraternity life can become for
some people.

We are thus reminded of a recent
article in The Wall Street Journal
which delved into the fraternity life
on American campuses. The article
stated in part: ;

“Now, in the post-Sputnik, post-
Birmingham era, the Greek letter so-
cieties are being called upon to justify
their existence. Many have responded
by lowering formal barriers to mem-
bership, by placing more stress on

scholarship and less on whoopee, and
by widening their contacts with other
segments of university life.

“Yet even as the Greeks move to
silence their critics, they find it in-
creasingly difficult to maintain their
popularity, prestige and power on
many campuses, and on others their
very presence is threatened.”

The report also states: “Many a
collegian shares his skepticism about
the merits of fraternity life. As the
burden of academic work grows, as
the competitive pressures for grades
mount, and as sentiment against dis-
crimination rises on the nation’s cam-
puses, more students and school ad-
ministrators tend to view fraternities
as anachronisms—throwbacks to less
demanding days when a Saturday beer
blast could always take precedence
over a tussle with the books, the ‘gen-
tleman’s C’ was a common academic
goal, and the exclusion of Jews and
Negroes from most fraternities was
tacitly accepted.”

The leading business publication is
not the only journal which is looking
hard at the Greek system.

In an editorial entitled, “A Pass-
ing Institution?” another national
newspaper stated last month: “Ameri-
can fraternities and sororities, often
an object of considerable curiosity on
the part of those from other lands,
are significantly changing their way of
life in a race for survival. Basicall
they are struggling to catch up wit
the times.”

The Christian Science Monitor con-
cludes: “The survival and usefulness
of these societies still depend upon
their ability to adjust to advancing
concepts of social responsibility and
individual maturity.” .

Davidson’s fraternity system is al-
ready under tight scrutiny this year,
and the IFC is falling all over itself
in trying to keep this game called
“rush” alive. .

In their fickle rules the council has
left the term “upperclassmen” as am-
biguous as ever, when substituting
the words, “fraternity man’ would
clarify many questions. Even though
the IFC should maintain authority
over rush, we believe that the faculty
committee on fraternities should at
least review the IFC's regulations, sug-
gesting any revision as the committee
may see as necessary.

Yet at the faculty committee’s meet-
ing on Tuesday, no copy of the revised
rules was presented. Reportedly,
only 4 mention was made that the
former rules had been “scrapped” for
a new set. As of yesterday the com-
mittee had still not received a copy of
the new regulations either for review
or merely for information.

These oversights on the part of the
IFC are unfortunate, to say the least,
and demand immediate attention and
redress.

It is also regrettable that the Class
of 1969 must play the part of guinea

igs in this year of necessary change;
hcwever, this is no reason for the
startling capriciousness of the IFC so
far this year.

We do not pretend to have the so-
lution to this compromise system of
Tush, but we do believe that a thor-
oughly practical set of rules is long
overdue. Several IFC members ex-
pressed the belief yesterday that an-
other change in the regulations—this
time for the better, we hope—is forth-
coming next week.

Again, we are apalled that such
unworkable rules could be agreed
upon by those students who sup-
posedly represent the best interests of
the fraternity system. Or is the sys-
tem doomed by its caprice this year?

We shall wait until next week for
the latest edition of the 1965-66 Rush
Regulations.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

‘52 Alumnus Takes Issue
With Lawrimore's Letter

Dear Editor:

I should like to respond to the.

letter of Mr. Buck Lawrimore
in your September 24 :ssue.

The response, as Mr.. Michael
Harrington brings out in his
column, has often been expres-
sed, but perhaps it should be
expressed again.

First off, Davidson College is
founded on a belief in God as
revealed through Jesus, the
Christ. Davidson is not preach-
ing Christ to bring in money:
rather it is preaching Christ be-
‘cause that is what it exists to
do — that is why it is kept in
existence, and it takes money
to do so.

Davidson's mission is to pro
duce liberally educated, Christ-
jan men for leadership in the
professions, business and_ in-
dustry and.in churches and com-
‘munities through the nation, It
does this by a certain amount
of Christian training. and train-
ing requires some disciplines.

The purpose of Davidson Col-
lege should be clear enough to
a prospective student to give
him an indication of what the
College's dedicated teaching
aims are and what some of the
consequent disciplines will be.
The College assumes the right
to set the disciplines it deems
necessary to properly respond
to those who have asked for its
training.

The Christian faith, which
Davidson College was founded to
propagate, jis found through
earnest seeking, not through
casual pursuing. It hardly seems
inconsistent with the teachings
of Christ that men who are

avowedly seeking Him are asked’

by a Christian training institu-
tion to give some formal atten-
dance to that pursuit.

I thought Mr. Harrington's
column an excellent examina-
tion of the conflict between “‘re-
ligious indoctrination and free
academic inquiry.”

First and foremost, however.
Davidson College begins with an

Dear Editor

Associate Editor Johnny
Clark's first article on the Los
Angeles riots was a remarkable
piece of journalistic irrespon-
sibility.

Clark not only wanted to let
us know that he was in Los An-
geles during the riots, but he
also fills the whole article with
accounts or “‘ironies’’ that have
little. if any, value to the under-
standing of the riots.

To write that “over half of
the deaths were Negroes” js
only to prove the charge of
police brutality which he tries
to deny, To write that ‘‘the riot-
ers spared only establishments
with ‘Blood Brother’ signs’ is
only to lie because there is good
evidence that stores were dam-
aged indiscriminately, and in
spite of signs.

T think Clark could be more
responsible if he could show
that it is wrong to equate mob
violence with civil rights move-
ments as the head of the Ala-
bama State Police tried to imply.
He could also serve the cause
of truth and impartiality if he
understood that the riots were
caused primarily by economic
deprivation rather than racial
hatred.

Lawrimore

Dear Editor:

We are pleased that Mr. Wil-
liam A. White Jr. is concerned
enough for the College to at-
tempt to justify its stand on
compulsory worship, although
we are at the same time disap-
pointed that no one on the fac-
ulty or administration has cared
enough to write in defense. As
Mr. White himself has noted,
his own defense is the usual
one, and hopefully in replying
to him we will also reply to
others who agree with his points.

Although he used a great
many glorious phrases to ex-
press it, Mr. White's basic point
seems to be simply that David-
son cannot fulfill its ‘tmission”
without requiring its students to
worship God. With that line of
thinking we thoroughly disagree.

Davidson's Christian commit-
ment is admirable and, to many
of us who have been or are

¥ related to it, this commitment

is desirable. As Christians we
rejoice that the institution of
liberal education we attend also
upholds our highest ideals, and
we feel that the spirit of Christ-
jan love is a major and certain-
ly a vital part of the warm at-
mosphere we all breathe here.

Most of us, upon reflection,
would agree that the College
can best communicate its ideals
to us by presenting us with
speakers who are highly capable
of ‘expressing the appeal and
power of the Christian gospel,
But the vast majority of us stu-
dents are also quite capable of
seeing the distinction between
worshipping God and hearing
(or enduring, as the case may
be) a speaker espouse his views.

Why can’t the faculty and ad-
ministration see the significance
of this distinction? God only
knows. It seems that anyone
with a conscience must agree
that worship should never be
compelled.

We students niight well say,
“Out of respect I will listen to
your beliefs. But when you force
me to signify that I have ac-
cepted your beliefs, when you
force me to worship as you wor-
ship, you have gone too far.
You have violated my dignity
as a human being.”

Perhaps the dismal truth of
the issue is that the College has
too little respect for our dignity
as human beings. Perhaps the
time has come, long overdue,
for us students to demand re-
spect.

CLOSE - UP

By TOM CRAIG
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Life is easy at “Mother Davidson.” Just ask any
of the 12 boys who spent their Junior Year in
France — they’ll tell you.

From the comparative smallness and security of
Davidson, the French group was plunged into a univ-
ersity of.20,000 students and a campus spreading
over a city of 100,000. Many little things are taken
care of at Davidson that we found ourselves having
involvedly to do in Montpellier.

Take, for example, the simple item of conveni-
ence. We have only to walk five minutes at the most
from dorm to farthest class at Davidson. The situa-
tion in Montpellier finds classes in buildings scat-
tered widely over the city. This necessitated pur-
chase of some sort of “wheels” by the entire group.
Even so, did you ever try bucking the nine o’clock
traffic on your motorbike to get to Poly Sci?

HOT SHOWERS

A luxury item at Davidson is the hot water
shower. What a shock it was for Davidsonians to ad-
just to a weekly bath schedule, but the French stu-
dents did it, so we figured we could. Several of the
group roomed in a private dormitory where hot
showers were promised, but the water heater de-
veloped some chronic illness.

Ever leave a light burning in your room here on
campus? You wouldn't in France, if you didn’t want
to be evicted. Electricity is very expensive, and land-
lords view every volt you use with grudging eye.

A simple matter here, every Monday, is to drop
your bag of dirty clothes by the laundry. It’s not
so simple in France, where high laundry costs and
slow service encouraged us Davidsonians to get extra
mileage from each article of clothing. Many of the
groups did most of their own washing, and gradually
converted their wardrobe to nylon and wash and

wear fabrics.
CAFETERIA LINES

We ate in the University cafeterias for about
27 cents a meal. At.that price, you couldn’t afford to
pas it up, but neither could the other 20,000 stu-

ents!

Horrendous lines developed in the three stu-
dent restaurants at mealtimes. At first we polite
Davidsonians were fair game for the expert French
line maneuverers, but before long, we were in there
shoving with the best of them.

Our best practice was logged Sundays, when but
one of the restaurants was open to serve the student
hordes. That day, line switching became a serious,
dirty fight. To survive it took an excellent sense of
timing, a nerve of steel, and a complete lack of con-
science. I'll never forget one night, when three girls
fainted in the push, two pairs of eyeglasses were
broken, and several accidentally dropped shoes were
lost forever.

Ever complain about the lack of telephones on
our campus? Just try to find one in France. Most of
the time, it was necessary to go all the way to the
central post office and fight a line for a booth. Trv
this once, and you decide you REALLY don't need
to call anyone.

The library we used in France featured one
large study room, which was about as quiet as Free-
dom Park on July Fourth. It was poorly lighted, ill-
ventilated, definitely not designed for study. A closed
stacks system made obtaining a book an ordeal.

PARKING PROBLEMS

Parking for motorists proved quite a problem.
The Schools of Law and Letters were both in Ancien-
ne Ville, the medieval part of Montpellier. There
was never any assurance when you turned into a
street that you would be able to get out again.
Some fairly wide streets became alleys. and then
abruptly became flights of steps, in a three block
distance. .

Most often, to pass oncoming traffic, one of you
had to ride along the sidewalk. All this difficult
driving was complicated by the ubiguitous motor
bikes, bicycles, and Vesnas plying the streets and the
ever-present fear that a neighborhood housewife was
‘going to dump her garbage out the third-story win-
dow onto your car.

Maybe it sounds like a difficult, a discouraging
life. Well, it’s NOT. It’s only different from what we
know at Davidson, and to me, this is one of the
major advantages of the entire Junior Year Abroad
experience. In adjusting, we grew.

Freshman Hite Calls For
Change In Vespers Rule

Dear Editor:

During my first couple of
weeks here I have heard, it
seems, more than one would ex-
pect to hear concerning church.
chapel, and attendance required
by the college.

It seems that the roots behind
this barrage of college policy lie
somewhere between fear of early
student dissention this year and
a determined stand taken by the
Board of Trustees.

I believe the trustees were
right in having taken a stand
which supports the church
through the college and vice ver-
sa. The questions arise from the
manner of operation of the sys-
tem. Deeper questions come
from the students themselves
asking: “If this true religion?"
and ‘‘Can Christ be found this
way?”

t NEED SOMETHING
FASHIONABLE, Nor Too
GAUCY, Nor Too
CONSERVATIVE, BUT
TASTY.

Certainly the well planned Ves-
pers program offers an unequal-
ed opportunity for students to
absorb the varied aspects of in-
@ividuals and locations on reli-
gion. But undoubtedly required
worship service cannot be the
answer to a student's search for
truth and Christ. The drive, the
desire to worship must and will
(or won't) come from him.

It is not for the college to re-
quire worship, indeed only God
can require this~—and even he
does not. He requests it of us as
independent beings of his crea-
tion. Beings with the right—the
God given right—to choose for
ourselves between Heaven and
hell. Certainly one can worship
at a Davidson Service. The point
is that one can not be free to

worship.
It seems ironic that when a

student misses church here he
is more likely to feel his punish-
ment in the form of a cut rather
than ashamedness for his neg-
lect of Christ.

Also humorous was the remark
comparing required attendance
in classes with the required at-
tendance for chapel and vesp-
ers. If church attendance is to
be similar to class—why then,
say in order to make us better
church-goers, couldn't we be giv-
en graded reports and semester
hours credit for our attendance
and progress there,

Once again I'll repeat that the
college does have a duty to in-
culcate and stimulate the relig-
ious nature in its students, but
this progrum as it now stands
seems too militaristic. It Jacks
and indeed can only Jack the
true meaning of really free wor-
ship.

Let it be agreed that a change
in the chapel and vespers policy
would present various problems
already stated by President Mar-—
tin. However, could we not have
these visiting pastors come and
speak at a required religious pe-
riod during the week (say a
chapel period), This would Jeave
Sunday services open to we few
who in our own way would like
to find and worship God.
