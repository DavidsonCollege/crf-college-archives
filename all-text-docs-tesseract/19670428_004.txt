Yokoseki and Johnson, repre-

sense of the word.”

The other resolution condemn-

The Student Council has dis-
tributed forms to faculty mem-
bers asking them to participate
in student course evaluations be-
fore final exams this semester.

Participation in the program
is completely voluntary and pro-
fessors are asked to request the
number of forms they will need.

The purpose of the evaluation
is to serve as ‘‘a means of stu-
dent-faculty communication that
will provide professors a great-
er insight into their effective-
ness and will provide students
‘an opportunity to re-think their
‘attitude toward schoo! work,”
‘according to the letter sent to

professors by Student Council
members Peter Hobbie and Bill
Watson.

The purpose of distributing
the forms before exams is to get
more students to fill them out

‘*Many people feel that this is
exactly the type of program that

added.

Students Give Blood In Annual ROTC Drive

College Sets New Record
In Blood Drive Donations

By DAN GRAHAM
Staff Writer

Donations spurted to a new
record in thé Red Cross blood
drive here this week.

“We.had the biggest turnout
for the blood drive in the past
three vears,"’ said Capt. Joe B
Crawle-.. head of the Davidson
blood drive.. The drive supplied
the Red Cross with 262 pints of
blood on April 24-23.

“In the fraternity competition.
Kappa Alpha was first with
66.5¢< of the members donating.
Sigma Phi Epsilon was second
with 55° and Sigma Alpha Ep.
silon was third with 51%." Craw
ley continued. There was also a
large turnout among the Inde-
pendents.

Col. Frederick B, Qullaw. head

ganized by the ROTC Depart- ;

“Although this drive was or-:
ganified by the ROTC Depart-.
ment, it is a community affair, |
and the success or failure of the
drive depends on community:
support.” y

Outlaw and Crawley both em-.:
phasized that the Red Cross was ,
responsible for the drive. Outlaw
further added. “This blood is:
used for the community, so we |
do get benefits from it.” He;
cited several instances of people.
in Davidson receiving blood.

Crawley said he hoped the col-
lege would again win the plaque
for the largest blood drive par-
ticipation in North Carolina and
northern South Craolina.

He pointed to April 12-13 ar-
ticles in The Dunn Record and
The Dunn Dispatch of Dunn
which said. ‘“‘Many colleges ac-
tively support the Red Cross
Blood Program and an award is
made to the college that has the
highest percentage participa-
tion. Davidson College has won
this award three out of the last
four years.”

A POUND OF FLESH

The trophy would have become
a permanent possession of the
college if Davidson had won it
for the third consecutive year
last year. Mitchell College won
the award last year. “We can
win this year’s award if we
can get as large a turnout next
fall as we did this spring.”
Crawley commented.
