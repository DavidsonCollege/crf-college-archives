FRAZIER AGAIN

As cinderpath coursers stack up Earl
Frazier “is the top.” He is now enter-
ing upon his third year of college com-
petition as a distance runner, and only
one defeat blemishes a record filled with

unusually fast times in-all of the three
long distance events.

In the State meet at Chapel Hill
last spring he ran the fastest mile
and two mile races that were re-
corded in the south all season, and
the fastest that have ever been run
in North Carolina.

He began his 1935 conquest by defeat-
ing a field of formidable competitors
representing several outstanding south-
erm-universities at the Jay-Cee indoor
games held in the Charlotte Armory a
couple of weeks ago, and continued on
the warpath Saturdey night by making
a record-breaking run in the half-mile
trek in the annual indoor meet at Chapel
Hill.

It will be interesting to watch
this Wildcat ace during the ensu-
ing season, and particular fascinat-
ing will be his duel with the cele-
brated Harry Williams of Carolina,
who has run with the national
champions, Glenn Cunningham,
Bill Bonthron, and Gene Venzke.

PITTMAN DAY

Saturday afternoon Richardson Field
saw a great deal of Barium Springs,
and in more ways than one. Aside from
a large crowd of visitors who repre-
sented the orphanage at the “Barium
Springs Day,” there were quite a few
graduates of the Barium School who
took part in the intra-squad football
game that the Wildcats played for the
benefit of the orphanage.

Paul Pittman, who hails from
Barium, was one of the outstand-
ing performers in this last of the
winter practice games, and his
tow-headed brother who is now in
about the third grade at Barium,
took off honors in a between-
halves contest staged by two 85
pound teams from the Orphans
Home. Young Pittman made two
long dashes for touchdowns which
gave his team a 13-6 victory. On
both these jaunts he displayed a
stiffarm that will almost match the
notable one of his older brother.
One onlooker remarked that it wasn't

just Barium Day but Pittman Day as
well.

INTERESTING INTERLUDE

An interesting interlude for this
rather uneventful season of the
year, right now, between the com-
pletion of winter sports and the
begining of the spring calendar, is
the annual boxing tournament that
Captain Pritchett runs off.

This has always proved to be a high
light in the intramural program at Da-
vidson. Last winter some real pugilistic
talent was revealed, and tonight you
will be able to see more scrappy punch-
ers when the final bouts take place at
the local gym.

PLENTY POWERFUL

After observing the Wildcats in
their final Winter football drill Sat-
urday afternoon, we are more
thoroughly conviriced of our state-
ment a few weeks ago that they
would be “plenty powerful” in
1935.

There are, of course, quite a large
number of wrinkles that will have to
be ironed out before the fall whistle
sounds, but that is the main purpose
of winter practices, to discover where
the machine needs oiling and apply the
grease in the proper places.

BARIUM MIDGETS PLAY

Proceeds Of Game Will Go To
Barium Orphanage

The Davidson Wildcats ended their
spring football practice Saturday after-
noon with a scrimmage in which the
Greys and Reds tied 0-0. Over 500 peo-
ple attended this game on Barium
Springs Day and the entire proceeds will
go to the Barium Orphans’ Home.

The Greys made eight first downs to
the Reds’ four. The Reds were aided
with the gains made through the line by
Irving Hogan. Paul Pittman made sev-
eral 15-yard runs and Yarborough hit
the line with consistent gains for the
Greys. “Teeny” Lafferty and Fred Den-
nis, both from the freshman team,
showed up well. Both teams came with-
in scoring distance of the goal. The
Greys threatened first when Pittman
caught Hogan's kick on the 50-yard
line and ran it back to the Reds’ 30-
yard line. On the next play Pittman
was thrown for a three-yard loss by
Hack Sanders. Baxter Yarborough hit
center for four yards. Pittman then
threw a beautiful pass that was inter-
cepted on the Reds’ 10-yard line.

In the second half, due to a 15-yard
run by Hogan, a pass from Hogan_to
Fields Young, and a lateral from Young
to Dennis for 14 yards, the Reds reached
the Greys’ 20-yard line, but could not
penetrate the Grey line and the ball
went to the Greys. Again in the last
half the Greys reached the Reds’ 11-
yard line, but were thrown for a loss
in the next two plays by the Red line,
and the balt went to the Reds. Neither
team exhibited much speed during the
game and both tried many passes, but
completed only one or two.

During the six weeks’ practice the
Greys have won five games to the Reds’
one. In the game Saturday the Reds
showed mtich improvement. ;
Between halves of the varsity game,
two 85-pound teams from Barium
Springs played. On’ the kick-off one
team started a march down the field
that ended in a touchdown. On the fol-
lowing kick-off, Henry Pittman, of the
opposing team, took off his shoes and
rfan for a touchdown. ‘The score was
tied 6-6 when Paul Pittman’s brother
again took the pigskin over the goal line
to win for his team, 12-6.

New System Arranged
For Intramural Track

This year the intramural track will
be handled in an entirely ney way. It
will be run off by a standard of. points.
There will be, as in the decathlon, four-
teen events in which there will be set
a certain standard to which a:contestant
must measure up to before he can earn
any points for his team. Heretofore, it
was conducted in the form of a regular
track meet, and the score was also kept
as in thé regular track meet. The indi-
vidual who completes his ten out of the
fourteen events in the best time, the most
distance or height, as a whole, will be
awarded a very beautiful trophy for the
performance. The competition started
last Monday and will continue at the
rate of about three events a day until
all the events have been completed.

IN FINAL SPRING GAME

Two Davidson Matmen
Enter National Meet

Two members of Davidson's state
champion wrestling team have been
selected to enter the “National Col
legi Champi ip tour
sponsored by the National Amateur
Athletic Association. Charles Fort,
captain of the team, will enter in the
165 lb. division, while Leroy Black-
welder, captain-elect for next year,
will enter the 155 lb. class.

The championship meet will be
held at Lehigh University in Bethle-
hem, Pa. and the Davidson repre-
sentatives will leave on the morning
of March 20 and will be away about
four days. Matmen from colleges
throughout the nation will be pres-
ent and, needless to say, the best
collegiate wrestlers in the land will
be entered. Winners of this tourna-
ment will be matched with next
year's champions to determine the
team to represent the United States
in the Olympic Games at Berlin in
1936,

Coach Unger has chosen Fort and
Blackwelder for their outstanding
record and exhibition of skill dur-
ing the past season. These two men
have remained undefeated in the
eleven meets that they entered dur-
ing the 1934-35 season. Both have
ben highly praised by coaches of
opposing teams who give them the
credit for leading the Wildcat grap-
plers through a successful year.

Indoor Meet t

DAVIDSON RANKS THIRD

Dickson And Beverly Place In
Dash And Hurdles

Davidson’s freshman and varsity track
teams went to Chapel Hill last Satur-
day night, March 9, to compete in the
annual Southern Conference track and
field championship.

The Davidson teams entered only
three events. These were the 60-yard
dash, 70-yard high hurdles, and the 880-
yard run. Parker, a high hurdler, was
unable to go ‘because of sinus trouble.
Deyerly, a member of the freshman
squad last year, took his place.

In the non-conference division, David-
son placed third with eight points. Wil-
liam and Mary, the winner of the non-
conference division, was well ahead of
the rest of the field with twenty-one
points.

Davidson placed in three events. Dick-
son took a third in the 60-yard dash,
Deyerly placed. fourth in the 70-yard
high hurdles, and Frazier took a first
in the 880-yard run, which was the fea-
tured race of the non-conference divi-
sion.

Bullard of William and Mary set a
new record last year in this run of 2
minutes, 2.7 seconds. Frazier came in
third in that race. However, this year
Frazier went ahead to defeat Bullard
and also break the record which he had
made last year. The new record as
made by Frazier is 2 minutes, 1.8 sec-
onds. Frazier took the lead in the first
of the race and was never challenged.
This was the fastest half-mile ever run
by Frazier either indoor or out. At the
end of tHe race a great ovation was
given him by the crowd.

Two freshmen, Barrow and Wicker,
were entered in the freshman division
of the high hurdles. Barrow qualified

CAGE DRAMA TD
BE REPRODUCED

Richards And Lyon Challenge
Varsity To Revenge Basket-
Game

It has been said that opportunity
knocks but once. This, however, is not
true with reference to the opportunity
that Davidson folk had several weeks
ago of seeing basketball as it should
be played. Yea, as it was played in that
recent unforgettable cage classic be-
tween the faculty and varsity!

The fact that the faculty can “take
it” and is now ready to “dish it out’
was evidenced by the release of the fol-
lowing notice,

“We, the members of the faculty, hav-
ing completely recovered from all cor-
poral injuries but still smarting under
the sting of the defeat handed us by
the varsity in our former conflict, do
hereby challenge the aforesaid. varsity
to a basketball game to be played at
1745 Saturday afternoon, March 16.

Dr. Scott C. Lyon, Manager.
Dr. C. M. Richards, Cheerleader.”

Were the spirits of the faculty damp-
ened by that recent loss? No, no, a
thousand times no! That is the reply
given to that question by the capable
manager, Dr. Lyon, and the peppery
cheerleader, Dr. Richards. They are out
for revenge and the experts predict just
that, particularly if that student versus
professor combination re-occurs.

The varsity mustered enough courage
to accept this challenge, and unless it
learns of the perils that lie in wait, it
will have five courageous youths on the
floor to give their all. For what? To
give youSthe best in entertainment, and
incidentally to raise the necessary cash
with which to purchase “D’ sweaters
to ward off next winter’s icy blasts.

The curtain will rise promptly at 1:45
Saturday afternoon and all will be over
by 2:30,.provided the varsity doesn’t run
out of players before that time. This
time was set to allow ample time for
those attending the tea dance. Admis-
sion will be twenty-five cents for stu-
dents and ten cents for girls accom-
panied by students.

Cheerleader Dr. Richards will posi-
tively be on hand, as much depends on
his ability to rouse the spirits of his
men. Warren, Dees,’and Mcleod have
done a good job this year, but the doc-
tor dwarfs’ their most noble perform-
ances with his collegiate yells and snap-
py antics.
