Committee eyes problems,
proposes viable solutions

By JIM ENTWISTLE
Staff Writer

Since the beginning of fall
term, the SGA Evaluation
Committee has been examin-
ing various aspects of the
college program.

Co-chairmen Mark Rabil
and Andy McElwee feel that
the purpose of their committee
is to get a general view of as
many areas of the college as
possible and to then develop
recommendations to deal with
these areas. In order to ac-
complish this task, the com-
mittee has been meeting once
a week with an administration
member to look at a different
area in depth.

Rabil commented, ‘‘We’re
not an action group, but
rather we’re taking a look at
these different areas in order
to find out what’s going on.
Our general interest is the
quality of student life and we
hope to make some sugges-
tions for programs that will
really look to the future.”’

The result of the Evaluation
Committee’s research will be a
report of recommendations.
This report will be completed
in January and presented to
SGA President Bo Baskin and
to the Trustees.

Some of the academic rec-
ommendations will center a-
round the need for a perma-

Lid.

The committee has also
been discussing. possible- im-
provements for the infirmary,
the establishment of language
houses and the critical over-
crowding situation in the Pat-
terson Court eating houses.

McElwee emphasized that
the members of the adminis-
tration who have come to the
weekly meeting have been
extremely co-operative which
has enabled the group to have
frank discussions of college
problems.

“‘When Ken Wood spoke
with us, we had a very good
discussion on the possibilities
of reorienting the academic
program away from being

strictly classroom and putting
more emphasis on experiential
learning situations where stu-
dents can apply what they
have learned in the classroom.
We also discussed the idea of
requiring each student to
spend at least one term away
from Davidson during their
four years.”’

Both Rabil and McElwee
are optimistic that their com-
mittee’s work will serve as a
basis for dynamic new pro-
grams which will enhance the
program that the college offers
to the student body. However,
in the course of their investi-
gations, some of what they
have discovered has not been a
source of optimism.

McElwee commented:

“Everything here comes down
to inadequate funds and plan-
ning. Sometimes it seems that
there is no vision for every-
thing that this college could
be.”

based on the department’s
expenditures during the pre-

These budget requests are
then reviewed by the Pres-

An open meeting is then
