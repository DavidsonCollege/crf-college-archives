Why ...

“The time has come,’’ the walrus said,
“to talk of many things”... And from the
wide variety of subjects we could under-
take to discuss, we have selected a topic
which we believe is of somewhat greater-
interest to every reader than the walrus’
much belabored cabbages and kings.

Every member of the student body is at
present in the process of wasting four years
of his life unless he is-here for a REASON.
There could be few more important issues
upon which we could dwell than that
REASON. What is the value of a liberal arts
education? What is liberal arts?

In the words of a renown college presi-
dent we are now in the process of cultivating
the ability ‘‘To be at home in all lands and
all ages; to count nature a familiar acquain-
tance, and art an intimate friend; to gain a
standard for the appreciation of other men’s
work, and the criticism of one’s own; to
carry the keys of the world’s library in one’s
pocket and feel its resources behind one
in whatever task one undertakes; to make
most of friends among men of one’s own age
who are the leaders in all walks of life; to
lose oneself in generous enthusiasms and co-

erate with others for common ends; to
bane manners from other students who are |

gentlemen;and_toform character under pro-
fessors who are Christian. These are the re-
turns of a college for the four best years of
one’s life”

To have achieved this is to have developed
within oneself a discerning nature—capable
of surveying the whole of-life and selecting
from among the myriads of details that £0,

constantly in mind beeause of the immensity
of its scope. By the very nature of what we
are doing, events take place day by day,

us in the art. of piecing together these un-

editor,

Dear Editor:

I find several rather shocked members
amony the student body in relation to the
chapel program of February 4, led by Mr.
Hugh Farrier.

We feel the Holy Bible is never a book
to be taken in such a light manner. ‘The as-
sociation of the Scriptures with Justy and
sensual thoughts, as was definitely the ease,
is nothing short of a sacrilege.

Perhaps, let’s prefer to believe so, the
speaker did not intend to belittle the serious-
ness and sacred meaning to the Bible’s words,
but the use of biblical references in a sup-
posedly humorous manner without any moral
or object other than to amuse the audience
is decidedly out of place in Davidson, or
any other place that upholds Christian ideals.

1 realize that mintster sometimes uses
some innocent humor to emphasize his moral,
but he never uses scriptural references in an
earthly or vulgar way merely to provoke
laughter from his audience.

With apologies to the good intentions» of
the speaker, his means of obtaining pointless
laughter was definitely in poor taste, espe-
Gially in our daily devotional period, Other |
speakers.will- do-well to reniember the sacred-
ness of the Scriptures and avoid the associa-
tion or contradiction of any part of it by de-
sires of human weakness.

J am not a ministerial student, but was
surprised by this lack of respect to the Holy
Word at Davidson where we are lead to be-
lieve that the student is from a background
emphasizing deep reverence for the Lord’s
Word.

Professors
By NEIL LEACH
PROF. J. H. OSWALT

Those students who went up to
Duke last year for the purpose’ of
taking the Vocational and Educa-
tional Guidance Tests probably met
Prof. J. H. Oswalt for at that time
he was the assistant director of this
department at Duke, Prof. Oswalt
resigned this position last year and
now is serving his first here in
Davidson a member of the
Psychology Department.

This part of the country is not
unfamiliar to Prof, Oswalt. for he
Was born in Statesville and grew up
there, later he attended Davidson
and enjoyed all the privileges - of
being a@ mere twenty miles from
homey In 1935, after his graduation
from Davidson, he went to Glade
Valley High School where he taught
for two years. Seeking—more—in-
teresting field of instructing, Prof.
Oswalt was employed for one year
teacher at Flora McDonald
College. This was “quite an experi-
ence’ for our neat, pipe-smoking
professor, but today he is still con-
tinuing his life without feminine
guidance,

as-a

Five years in the Army seems
like an awfully long time, but that’s
how long Prof. Oswalt served—59
months, to be exact. This time was
not spent idly we can be sure, for
before he was discharged he
achieved the rank of lieutenant
colonel. Plenty of action shuffling
paper “was not entirely enjoyed by
our professor during the time that
he served as chief of military per-
sonnel in the Far Eastern Air Com-
mand. This-position in the—“chair
corps” was given up without argu-
ment ‘in. 1946 when Prof. Oswalt
got his final release papers.

Soon after his return to civilian
life, Prof. Oswalt went to Duke
for two years to complete his grad-
uate work. Most of the time just
previous to his coming to Davidson
was spent at Duke as a graduate
student and as a member of the
Testing and Guidance Bureau of
the university.

Prof. Oswalt is another member
of Prof. Purcell’s “bush league”
golf club. He hasn’t yet mastered
the game but greatly enjoys the
trips to the course, Hiking is another
of Prof. Oswalt’s favorite forms of
recreation, He has tackled the Ap-
palachian ‘Trail, but has not yet
covered the entire length .of this
beautiful, but exacting, trail. Here’s
hoping he will attain this difficult
goal this summer:
