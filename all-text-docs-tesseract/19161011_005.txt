THE DETERMINING FACTOR

The Student Body, almost to a unit,
saw the Davidson warriors administer
defeat to the Aggies on last Saturday,
and not a few are offering the reasons
why. The victory was due, you say, to
the united efforts of the whole team.
Yes, that’s true. Each man fought hero-
ically; but, in going back to the ulti-
mate cause, let us not forget the coach-
ing of “Bill” Fetzer. Neither before
the game was there a bulletin issued
from the Davidson camp announcing
what the team would do, nor was there
one after it telling what it had done—
but we all saw the result.
What I am going to say is this: Dav-
idson has a coach who places clean
sports above the alternative of winning
or loosing a particular game. The
treatment which the Aggie players re-
ceived at the hands of their coach be-
tween halves at the game in Charlotte
Saturday must be condemned by all
lovers of true sport. Davidson's record
for clean sport is one that is unsurpassed,
and her present coach, W. M. Fetzer,
is one of the staunchest advocates of the
all-around clean game that Davidson
has ever had. REwnor.

This arrangement makes necessary a
change in the schedule of recitations.

MANDOLIN AND GUITAR
CLUB ORGANIZED

A Mandolin and Guitar Club was
recently organized under the leadership

7 Chambers of J. L. Fowle. ‘This club will consist
of about fifteen men. About ten men
. will play the mandolins while the re-
F ellows-- mainder will, play guitars.

This organization will be under the
direction of the Orchestra and Glee
Club, and some of its men will be used
in the latter. “There are a number of
good musicians in the Freshman class.
All who can use these musical instru-
ments are urged to come to the first
practice, which will be announced soon
at chapel. Clubs of this nature have
been inaugurated in other colleges and
it is hoped that it will meet with equally
as great a success at Davidson.
