Drops 2

On Charleston Swing

By Bruce Balestier

After turning in a solid 2-2
showing at the Virginia Common-
wealth Tournament last weekend,
the Davidson volleyball
team came away feel-
ing pretty good about
its 7-3 record. But
complacency may have .
gotten the better of the
Wildcats, as they hitthe
skids abruptly with dis-
appointing losses at
Charleston Southern
and The College of
Charleston.

In Tuesday’s Big
South matchup with the
Buccaneers, Davidson
rebounded from a two
games to none deficit to
knot the match at two
games all, only to collapse with a
15-7 loss in the deciding game.
Coach Rebecca Hawkins was
somwhat surprised that the mo-
mentum from the ‘Cats’ swift 15-
4 pasting-of the Bucs in game 4
didn’t carry over into game 5. It
didn’t, and Davidson quickly found
itself down 8-1 and never recov-
ered.

Hawkins found fault with her
team’s mental toughness. ““We’re
not mentally ready to fight,” she

said. In addition, 8 service errors
and 13 service receiving errors
spelled doom for the Wildcats.
“That was the difference,” said

Hawkins. Amy Howard shone in
defeat for the ‘Cats, recording 16
kills for a .457 hitting average
withoutcommitting an error. Janet
Delery notched 14 kills and 11

digs. vo
But while the loss to Char- -

leston Southern was’ not all to-
gether surprising, since you would

expect the occasional letdown over ©

the course of a long season, the
defeat the following night at the
hands of The College: of Char-

Beats Heat

By Richard Wharton

Davidson harriers overcame
adverse conditions September 14
to achieve several personal goals
at the Clemson Invitational. ‘The
women’s team showed their
strength witha fourth place finish,
scoring 108 points, while themen’s
team as a whole performed well
despite several individual injuries.
Conditions for the day were hot
and humid, which, combined with
rolling terrain, challenged the run-
ners’ personal limits. Though the
weather was a significant factor,
coaches Gary Andrew and Beth
Manson were pleased with the
overall outcome.

Coming in first for Davidson was
Kathy Beach, running a strong
19:35 to began her senior season
with a bang. Half a minute behind
her, sophomore Karen Marshall
sprinted through the finish with an
impressive-l 9:58. Freshman Eliza-
beth Bishop, in her first intercolle-
giate meet, raced to a solid 20:43

at Clemson

finish. Sophomore Jean DeMoss
was next for the Wildcats, running
a consistent 21:37, which puts her
in a strong position to move up in
the upcoming weeks. Rounding out
the lady Wildcats were Amy Ber-
tram (21:54), Carolyn Meadows
(21:58) and Lisa Sitek (22:00).
The men’s race was a truly dra-
matic event. Both the men’s and
women’s teams used mental exer-
cises to augment their physical
preparation. This almost worked
out too well, as half of the team
posted dangerously fast first miles.
Temperatures increasedas the race
went on, putting an extra tax on the
harriers’ bodies. At mile three
senior Ted Richardson twisted his
ankle on a hard right turn, forcing
him out of the race. But the final
act of high drama occurred at the
finish line when sophomore Cam
Dauler, recovering from illness,
- passed outat the finish line. Three

‘hours later, still recovering from .

heat exhaustion and dehydration,

leston was downright disquieting.
Hawkins had expected her team to
be motivated by redemption, but
instead watched them "come out
flat.” Char-
leston romped
in three con-
secutive
games, 10-15,
8-15, 12-15.

It was
an improved
Davidson at-
tack from the
night before,
but the unchar-
acteristic pa-
rade of errors
continued. The
Wildcats
turned in 6
service errors
and 14 service receiving errors,
and added 3 ball-handling errors
for good measure.

The team has come now to a
critical juncture in its season, and,
according to Hawkins, there are
but two options. ““We can learn
from it and turn it around or let it
take control of us. And if it does,
our season is down the drain.” The
intervening days until Davidson’s
return to action Tuesday at Win-
gate could determine the outcome
of the season.

Dauler stated that he could not
remember the last four miles of the
race. Nonetheless, he posted avery
strong time of 29:16 over the 8K
course.

Senior Chris Otrok led the Wild-
cats with a strong 27:36. Close
behind him, junior Ian Stewart
gutted it out for a 27:56, keeping
him within range of number one
runner Otrok. Next was Dauler,
followed by Richard Wharton, with
a very Satisfying 29:22, and Erik
McMichael with a 29:41. Round-
ing out the squad were runners Joe
Beach (31:44) and Kevin Wilson
(33:05), both running their first
intercollegiate meets for Davidson,
and Greg Fisher with a 34:17.

Despite the meteorological set-
backs, the team was very satisfied
with its overall performance ‘at
Clemson. The Wildcats return to
action this Saturday at the Char-
leston Southern Invitational.

‘Chapman Defies The Odds.

Part2
By Bruce Page

Chasen began playing competitively this summerin a league with college talent in his home state
of Maryland. and began to remove the critics’ doubts by hitting “ridiculously well.” He led his team

with a .478 batting average, an

and helped them to a first place finish in their division.

Chapman was recruited by Davidson out of high school as a catcher. In his freshman year, in fact,

_ hestarted 50 of 52 gamesatcatcher, playing solid defense and batting .280. Now, though, catching may
be too much of a strain for his foot; this summer he saw most of his playing time at third and first base.
Still, catching for the Wildcats remains a goal of his.
He still dreams of playing in the majors, and who knows? Chapman sets his goals, and things don’t
seem to stop him. “When you want something pretty bad... . the pain doesn’t seem like‘all that much,”
he says. “I was pretty set on getting back to what I could do.”

Sprinkle Leads

Women's Soccer Over G-W

By B'easy Helms

The Women’s Soccer team.

split a pair of games this week to
emerge with a 2-2 record. On
Monday, the Wildcats dominated
Gardner-Webb. Freshmen Ellen
Sprinkle continued to make asig-
nificant scoring impact, as she
gained her first collegiate hat trick.
In the first half, she scored two
goals, both of them assisted by
Susan Taylor.

Completing the first half,
Sprinkle felt like the “trash queen”
because her goals were the result
of Taylor’s hard work at bringing
the ball down the field.

In the second half she showed
the fans her skills and scoring abil-
ity as she took on several players in
the box and completed her hattrick.
Later in the second half, B’easy
Helms crossed the ball in to-Sally
Graham. Graham shot, and after
the goalie fumbled it, Helms fin-
ished the ball into the net.

at the Rhodes 20 with 3:34 to play.
Facing a third and 19 situation,
Howell threw to John Bodkin.
Although the pass was incomplete,
Rhodes was whistled for pass inter-
ference and the ‘Cats had the ball
atthe Lynx 19. Howell then picked
up a first down with an 11-yard
gain off a quarterback draw which
put Davidson at the Rhodes five-
yard line.
_ After an illegal procedure call,
Bruce Bannister’s five-yard gain
put the ‘Cats back on the Rhodes
five-yard line with 59 seconds in
the game. On the ensuing play,
Davidson was flagged for a false
start and the ‘Cats were forced to
operate from the 10 once again.
Howell looked twice to Shirley
and then to Bodkin on fourth down,
but was unable to hook up with
either. Robinson needed only ‘to
take one snap and fall to the ground

Only a few minutes passed
before Liz Clarke brought the ball
down the outside of the field and
crossed it in to the far post, where
Helms stomached it into the net.
The Wildcats moved up to 2-1
with the 5-0 win.

Unfortunately, the team was
not as successful this weekend,
when they travelled to James
Madison and were dominated in a
6-0 defeat.

Presently, the ‘Cats are troub-
led by injuries to both of their
goalkeepers. Courtney Robertson °

- 18 out for 10 days with a knee

problem and Liz Schaper is suffer-
ing from difficulty with her shoul-
der. Colleen Camaione mighthave
to step in as keeper if Schaper is
unable to play.

The team returns home this
week to meet Duke at 3:30 p.m. on
Wednesday and Virginia Tech on
Saturday at 4:00 p.m.

“AN

to assure the Lynx of the victory.

After surrendering 130 yards of
total offense in the opening quar-
ter, Davidson’s defense tightened
and allowed only 63 yards the rest
of the game.

“T believe, without a doubt, that
our defense played well enough to
win,” Fagg said. “If you give up 13
points,a game, you'll win nine
games out of 10.”

“We were even all the way but
they were just a little bit better,”
linebacker Chris Leak said.

Bannister’s 111 yards on 20 car-
ries and Howell’s 79 rushing yards
led Davidson to 252 yards of total
offense to 193 for Rhodes. Al-
though the ‘Cats only held the ball
for 4:43 in the first quarter, they
finished the game with 33:24 of
possession and a sizeable advan-
tage over the visitors.

The loss was a painful one, but
the ‘Cats will have a chance to
raise their record to 2-2 this week-
end at Emory and Henry. ““We’re
so thankful that we have a chance
to play next Saturday,” Fagg said.
