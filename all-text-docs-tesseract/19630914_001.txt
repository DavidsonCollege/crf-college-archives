The era of the “Gentleman’s C” at Davidson may well have been ended by an

Executive Committee policy

The committee has begun the first intensive, blanket drive to eliminate the “un-
derachiever” from the Davidson campus. In late August, almost 80 letters were sent}, .,
to students of the Sophomore and Junior Classes. While each of the letters were}
typed seperately to give the air of the personal touch, each had the same thing to

effected last month.

say, in effect: “Underachiever, put out or get out.”

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts explained how the label
of “underachiever” was pinned
on nearly one of seven in the
two classes concerned and how
it will continue to be used with
all future classes at Davidson:

“The Executive Committee
took the information the Ad-
missions Committee took at the
time a mam enters college. The
Admissions Committee has a for-
mula they've used for the last
three years to determine what
a man can do at Davidson, It is
based on primarily two things—
the man’s rank in his secondary
school class and his college
boards.

“Using that formula, we can
come up with a man’s project-
ed average. There is an‘ allow-
ed deviation of .S of a point.
If a man is from .5 of a point
below to 5 of a point above
his projected average, he is
considered to be achieveing
normally.”

Thus, the Executive Commit-
tee of the faculty considers an
underachiever any student who
is making anything more than
.5 of a point below his project-
ed average. And “achieveing
properly” does not have any-
thing to do with actual grades.

Burts cited the example of one
underachiever who has a 1.95
average (nearly a B). He was
projected by the Admissions
Committee to have a 2.50 aver-
age.

Burts said that students from
private schools were not eval-
uated by the formula since rank
in class there meant little. There
is no projected average for
them from the Admissions Com-
mittee. The dean said that he
had to make a personal consid-
eration of their secondary school
record to decide whether or not
to place them in the under-
achiever category. He admitted
that pegging underachievers by
private study was not as accur-
ate as with the mathematical
formula. “But I have enough
savvy to spot an underachiever
from a private schoo],” he said.

As a result of the studies by
the dean on, achievement of
sophomores and juniors, every
student in the two classes now
has a rating: he is a normal
achiever, an underachiever or
an overachiever (if his average
is more than .5 of a point above
his’ projected average).

As to the fate of underachiev-
ers, the letters sent to them
sternly warned: “The subject of

Lagging Students Tell
Reactions To Letter

Fear swelled up in some; others were bitterly de-
fiant. Still others were indifferent. And from one frus-
trated scholar there even came a spark of gratitude. But
in most “underachievers,” when the Executive Commit-

tee’s crack-down on loafers
tions were encountered.

Assured of safety through
anonymity, a number of the
lackadaisical pupils revealed
their reactions.

Said one defiant schoolhouse
lawyer about the new decision:

"What irks me is the fact
that the academic require-
ments are clearly spelled out

After Controversy
Goodykoontz Now
Teaching At UNC

Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz,
who resigned last spring in
the midst of a controversy
involving himself and the
college administration, is
now at the University of
North Carolina.

The former English professor
and director of the Vagabonds
writes: “I shall be at Chapet Hill
for a year (by present plans),
teaching a couple of courses,
doing some writing, and taking
my time trying to find a prop-
er... small liberal arts college
where I should like to stay for
a while. Or maybe .-. . I'll take
up some other job.”

In the aftermath of Goody-
koontz’s resignation from the
Vagabonds in February came a
sharply debated question of the
role of creativity on the David-
son campus. Involved with the
professor in his struggle with
the administration were several
members of the Vagabonds.

The controversy became more
heated when the professor set
up a sharply critical display on
the subject in the galleries of
the Fine Arts Center. When the
ever-growing display soon in-
volved college officials in its
critique, the dispute boiled over.

Goodykoontz resigned. But
the supposedly ended hassle
sprang alive with new intensity
when Dean of Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston accepted the resig-
nation “effective immediately.”
Harmony finally came only after
Goodykoontz appealed to the
Board of Trustees. The board,
while reaffirming confidence in
Johnston and his action, voted
to reinstate the professor for
the remainder of the academic
year.

was announced, mixed emo-

as to what a stuzent must ac-
complish prior to entering
each class and prior to grad-
uation. No doubt, there is a
catch-all rule concerning at-
titude or something of that
sort which the college has in-
cluded in its regulations which
provides the Executive Com-
mittee with the means of
vaguely by-passing the clearly
spelled out academic require-
ments.”

With a rather indifferent at-
titude, another non-striver said
of the letter, “It was kind of a
reminder; it didn't tell me any-
thing new. It was kind of a
pressurizer. I didn't work very
hard last year; I hope it will be
different this year. It’s really
up to me and no one else. The
letter won’t help me work any
harder; it’s just another thing
to add pressure.”

Another C-man who received
the strongly worded late-August
note was indignant. “It didn't
tell me anything I didn’t al-
ready know—I find it highly in-
sulting.”

Another underachiever
thoughtfully said, “I think 1
deserved to get the letter if
they’re doing something like
this. I think my grades would
have come up anyway; they have
been coming up all along. I
wonder if they haven't made a
mistake in ranking me as to
what grades I should be mak-
ing.”

The most frequent com
plaint frem the underschiev-
ers questioned wes that they
did not know exactly what the
college expected ef them in
the way ef en average.

But there was one under-
achiever who felt happy over
the fact that he had received a
letter from the Executive Com-
mittee. “1 appreciate the fact
the college is following my pro-
gress,” he said. “I think it’s a
good thing the college {is inter-
ested in you. I feel that it would
be better to have gotten the
letter from someone who knows
me personally, like my faculty
advisor," he suggested.

Then there was the lagging
scholar who sharpened his mind
enough to make the statement,
“Ig there's a place for over-
achievers in this world, there's
a place for underachievers.”

than the end of the spring se-
mester next year the Executive
Committee will determine
whether or not your record
justifies continuance in the Col-
lege.”

Burts said that the sending of
the letters is practically all the
Executive Committee intends to
do to prod underachievers into
action. “The definite interest is
that improvement be made,”
Burts said. “The average re-
sulting from the improvement
should approach what the man
is capable of. I think 5 of a
point is approaching that.”

But if the prodding does not
work, Burts indicated strong-
ly that the Executive Commit- |
tee would suspend a student.
Burts did promise that “before
anyone is suspended, there
will be an intensive study of
his record. There will not be
anything automatic about this
suspension. We will wait and
get the record and study it.”

Burts said the Executive |
Committee would probably look.
favorably on substantial im-

t

even if such improvement did;
not raise him to an acceptable
average. But Burts also said no
systematic method has yet been
established for determining
whether one underachiever who
has not reached his potential
might be permitted to stay while
another might have to leave. He
hinted strongly that each in-
dividual case would be consider-
ed upon its own- merits.

New Vespers Rule
Effective Sunday

The students’ option of at-
tending the morning service of:
any Davidson church in lieu of
the required evening vespers
goes into. effect tomorrow, Sept. |
15. ¢

This new regulation will :

a student the choice of attend-
ing the Sunday evening vespers
service at the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church, or attend-
ing the Sunday morning worship
service of a local church. The
resolution was adopted by the
faculty last spring after being
discussed for several years.

Chaplain Will Terry announc-
ed the details of the new system
this week. Attendance cards will
be placed on a table in the nar-
thex of every church within the
town limits of Davidson. David-
son Methodist Church, Davidson
College Presbyterian Church,
and St. Albans Episcopal Church
are cooperating now; however,
other arrangements can be made
as needed, according to Chap-
lain Terry.

Only churches within the
town limits of Davidson are
affected. If a student doesn't
attend church in town in the
morning, he must attend the
regular college vespers serv-
ice in order to receive credit
for attendance.

For the three remaining Sun-
days in the month (Sept. 15, 22
and 29) morning worship serv-
ices at the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church will begin
at 9:45 a.m. The new Covenant
Life Curricuium will be taught
at this time with a discussion
following in church school] at
11 am. Services will revert to
the usual hour in October.

Probably Non - Existant

Editor Tim Kimrey, who has been fearful that funds for his Wildcat Handboo
provement by an underachiever,, might be reduced, will probably receive payment despite dissatisfaction by som

officials with the publication’s editorial comments.

Associate Director of Admis-
sions H. Edmunds White, who
usually orders 100 copies for
his office, was reported to have
said early this week that he
could not use this year’s hand-
book.

But in a DAVIDSONIAN inter-
view Wednesday White clarified
the report: “I would have reser-
vations about using this book
with these comments in trying
to interest a boy in Davidson.”
He pointed out the comments by
Editor Kimrey might be misin-
terpreted by prospective stud-
ents. who have not had first-hand
contact with Davidson.

White felt that Kimrey need
not worry about the money from
the books the Admissions Office
had ordered. The Official stated
that since his order had been
placed last spring, he would
take the books even though he
could not use all of them.

Business Manager Robert A.
Currie, who is also a member
of the Publications Board, did
not definitely say that the col-
lege would pay for books which
White does not. use. However,
Currie did say. “Mr. White or-
dered the books, and he would
have said something to me by:
now if he couldn’t use them.”

White went on to say, “There
are some editorial comments in:
there that are presenting the|
least favorable side of Davidson
College.” He hinted that sever-
al acquaintances did not think;
the editor’s words would be|
pleasing to prospective students. ;

White said that in considering '
whether or not to use the hand-

book he had to “think about it).

in the sense of the prospective
student.” He added, “As I read
some of the editorial comments
I can't help but feel that a boy
in Columbus, Ohio, might feel
that this book is the college's
official word to him.” The ad-
missions official said he felt a
boy ignorant of the schoo! might
“get the wrong impression.”
White did say, however, that
he might use a few of the books
this year with certain individ-
ual students who are not total-
ly unknowing of Davidson. “I've
run into certain students that I
would not hesitate to hand the
book to,” he commented.
White also said, “I don't feel
that it is particularly desirable

Editor Kimrey defended his
policy of revealing ‘a  well-
rounded picture of Davidson” to
the innocent eyes of the fresh-
men. “That book is an informa-
tion book and an introduction of
Davidson to new students,” he
said. “Omission of certain things
that are an intregal part of the
college is as great an error as
putting down something that is
completely false."

Questioned on the precedent

a period of silence which went into effect last night at

10 p.m. No rushee could have further contact with any

fraternity man until the close of pledging this afternoon.

‘Orientation Successful’
Says ’67 Frosh Advisor

BY BILL AITKEN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

“Well pleased!’ commented Tom Stafford, this year’s freshman advisor, concern-
ing the Class of ’67 orientation program this week. “I feel that the orientation pro-
gram met with definite success with both freshmen and faculty,” added Stafford. He
attributed this success in part to a change in the faculty reception and to the book,
The Right of the People by William O. Douglas.

At the reception, unlike pre- in previous years been concern- freshmen physically and social-
vious years, the students were ed primarily. with adjusting the ly. With the introduction of dis-

asked (to officially meet only Dr.
and Mrs. Frontis W. Johnston,
Dr. and Mrs. Richard C. Burts,
Chaplain Wil) Terry and Mrs.
J. B. Moore. The remainder of
the faculty were grouped accord-
ing to departments, and the
students could meet as many or
as few of the faculty members
as he chose.

Stafford remarked that at
first the reception moved slow-
ly but became a success as more
students mixed with the faculty.

The biggest change in this
year's orientation progtam was
the introduction of discussion
groups on Douglas’ book.

In the spring cach member of
the Freshman Class received a
letter requesting him to read
the above work before coming
to Davidson in the fall. On Tues-
day, Sept. 10, Dr. W. P. Minter,
professor of political science,
gave a brief resume of the book
during which he posed questions
to be discussed by the freshmen
immediately following his talk.

Robert Young, assistant dean
of students, said that the appar-
ent immediate success of this
discussion could lead te more of
this type activity in future fresh-
man orientations.

Young said, ‘Orientation has

cussion groups. the freshman is
now able to begin to adjust him-
self academically before classes
start.”

Other minor changes were al-
so introduced into orientation.
On Saturday, Sept. 7, the class
of ‘C7 convened in Hodson Hall
to hear presentations by
four members of the Davidson
faculty on various phases of
college life.

This combination of four
speeches within an hour assem-
bly, while necessarily limiting
the depth into which each speak-
er could pursue his topic, en-
abled the orientation program
to provide the fresimmen with
more time for discussion with
his group and advisor as well as
to give him more free time.

The faculty advisers’ picnics,
athletic proficiency tests, tours
of the library and campus, and
issuance of ROTC uniforms still,
however, remained on the agen-
da.

Stafford was pleased with the
use of freshman camp. With the
elimination of repetition, the
YMCA-sponsored camp became
not a pre-orientation orientation
but a definite asset to the over-
all program.
