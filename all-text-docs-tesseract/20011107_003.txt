As concern about terrorist attacks works
its way into even the most sanguine heart,
many Davidson residents have wondered
what would happen in the event of an
accident or crisis at the McGuire Nuclear
Plant. (The plant, located in nearby
Huntersville, is owned by Duke Power.)

After receiving queries from a handful

(IRI IC SERVICE
F UDLIU WERVICE

Emergency procedure
for nuclear accidents

of parents and students, President Bobby
Vagt asked The Davidsonian to print in-
structions for students and staff in the
event of an emergency.

If there were to be a disaster at the
McGuire nuclear plant, said Vagt, we will

_hear a loud, continuous wail. (Most

Davidson residents are familiar with the
siren; it goes off for periodic tests.)

There are four steps to take when you
hear that wail.

Davidson has specific emergency evacuation procedures in case
the unlikely disaster should occur at the McGuire Nuclear Plant.
