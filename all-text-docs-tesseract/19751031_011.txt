hard work and self-confi-
dence,” continued Martin’ in
his praise of Borch. ‘He is the
epitome of what Davidson

and to excell.”

The cross country season
ends this Saturday, but Borch
will not stop running: “I hope
to improve through track
season, where I will be doub-
ling in the mile and the three
mile.’’ Rest assured that no
one on the track team will
doubt him now.

not sure how good my chances

squad) said he would recom-
mend me for the team,’’ said
Blackwood.
