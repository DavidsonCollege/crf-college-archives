Those “Davidson people”
Alumni to get more involved

While speaking with a
church elder this summer, I
mentioned that I had just fin-
ished my freshman year at
Davidson College, and that I
had made such close friends
whom I will hold dear for the
rest of my life.

He re-
sponded, “Yep, those
Davidson people. . .they have

asort of cult between alumni.
They never seem to get
enough of each other.”
From that comment, I
started to reflect on the

_share much more thanacom-
moncampus; they share such —

traditional events unique to
Davidson like the Cake Race,
First Night Down, Self-se-
lection Night, and the strict
Honor Code.

There seems to be an
unusually high ratio of
Davidson students who
marry each other or return to
this small town to teach.

_ Call ita cult if you will,
but something sparks a defi-

nite passion among most

alumni, inspiring enormous
loyalty and dedication to our
school.

these “Davidson people,” and

where are they now? What.

link with the Davidson
Alumni Association and the
Davidsonian to develop a
regular column featuring ar-
ticles from a variety of distin-
guished alumni.

This column will span
such subjects as Wildcat
events, college life, and inter-
esting people from our
school’s past.

Hopefully, through this
column, we will be better able
to bridge the gap between
today’s students and alumni.

To my fellow Yankee: a guide for the Northerner going to school in the South

So you’re a Yankee, and
you’ re going to school in the

South. A-bold move, indeed. ‘

And I say that with ex-
perience. I, too, am.a so-
called Yankee, hailing from
Wellesley, Mass., a slice of
suburbia west of Boston.

By making like a bird

that senses a nip in the au--

tumn air, you’re saying
you’re willing to stray hun-

dreds of miles from home to

get the best possible under-
graduate education.

You’re saying you want
proof that the mercury can —
no lie — hit 80 degrees on an
early February afternoon.
And what does fresh-cut grass
smell like a mere three weeks
into second semester?

You’ re saying you never
want to see a snow shovel or
plow again. It is, however, to
say that when it does, don’t
expect to see any snow re-
movable techniques or tools
thrown into immediate ac-
tion — or any action at all.
Rather, look for the school
children to bask in the glow
of a week-long holiday.)

And you’re saying you
-want’'to. know if the much-
ballyhooed concept of South-

_ern hospitality is fact or fic-

tion.

But above all, you want
to know whatlife is like south
of the Mason-Dixon line.
You’re saying you want
something different. And the
South is, well, different — at
least, that’s one way to put it.

So while I wholeheart-
edly applaud your decision
to attend Davidson in rural
— though ever-increasingly
suburban — North Carolina,
there are a few things you
should know — tidbits of
regional know-how with
which you should arm your-
self before blindly charging
into the campus fray.

With that, I offer a set of
pertinent terms. Consider it
a guidebook for Yankees —
that’s us — living in Rebel
territory:

Bojangles’.. Low-bud-
get Southern sustenance —
in other words, heart-attack-
on-a-plate, only worse. Even
the green beans are bad for
you at this fine chicken-and-
biscuits establishment. A
word to the wise: Don’t stuff
your face with Bojangles and
then play intramural hoops.
Trust me, such a scenario

‘could get ugly.

Civil War. It ended
some 132 years ago, right?
It’s all right there in the his-
tory books: unprecedented
blood and gore, destruction
and loss of life; Gettysburg,
both the battle and address;

Abraham Lincoln; the aboli-
tion of slavery; Reconstruc-
tion, etc.

But only if you’re from
New England, Ohio, Penn-
sylvania, New York, or New
Jersey is that actually un-
equivocally acceptedhistory.

Pennsylvania and Maryland.

Aboveit: bad. Below it: good.

Sweet tea. Along with
unadulterated fat-on-a-stick,

Dixon cuisine — and, many
would argue, a staple of the

Southern way, of life in gen-.

If you don’t believe me,
I pose the following set of
questions:

How many Ulysses S.
Grant High Schools do you
see in the North? Now, how
many Robert E. Lee High
Schools do you see down
here? Point made.

Grits. A non-descript
pile of something or another.
Alone, they aren’t much more
than a tasteless, mushy grain-
like substance. But throw
cheese, meat hunks, salt, pep-
per, and/or cubes of pure lard
into the stuff — a common
cooking tactic in this area, it
seems — and you’ ve got your-
self a tasty treat.

article — dateline: Mobile,
Ala. — detailing-the undeni-
able social force that is sweet

Jay Grelen,-a columnist
for the Mobile Register, tells
a story about an occasion
some five years ago when he
spent a hot and sweaty day
picking cornin the fields out-
side Mobile and then — re-
luctant to sit down in a public
place because of his grimy
appearance — ordered a
sweet tea to go at a local
catfish restaurant.

“She (the waitress) came
back witha whole pitcher, sat
me on the porch in a rocking

chair and refused to take any ©

money,” Grelen is quoted as
saying. “I was so struck by
her kindness I nearly killed

myself, because I felt. obli-
gated to drink every sip:

:“T knew then that sweet
tea embodies all that is good
about the South and its hospi-
tality. Life’s too short not to
enjoy, and it’s too hot not to
have sweet iced tea.”

And, ona more personal
note, the omnipresent bever-
age has in two short years
become my undisputed drink
of choice. Without a doubt,
the absolute worst part of
spending my summers in the
North is the absence of the
irresistible nectar known as
sweet tea.

Waffle House. Notonly
the world’s leading server of
(overrated) waffles and the
region’s favorite and most
readily available 24-7 eatery,
but a true territorial phenom-
enon the likes of which we —
even us foreigners — can’t
ignore.

It’s chief all-night rival
— at least in Mooresville —
is Denny’s. If you crave
wannabee classiness and an
aspect of civility, Denny’s is
definitely the way to go. But

greasy spoons and a true
Southern experience — not

Y’all. Of all the South-

ernisms — and there are a

ton of them — this one is .

easily the toughest to disre-

gard as redneck gibberish.
Some Northerners at the Big
D pledge a no-y’all lifestyle,
but such a pact is much easier
said than done.

In my mind, the beauty
of y’all lies in its plural form.
The difference between say-
ing “you guys” and “y’all” is
relatively inconsequential.
But the disparity in the time it
takes to say “the things that
belong to you guys” and
“y’all’s”, well, that’s pretty
darn significant.

Granted, phrases
like“daggum,” “cotton-
pickin’, and “Oh my gravy”
are tough to swallow, but —
for simplicity’s sake, if noth-
ing else —“y’all” is tough to
beat.

Plus, “all of y'all” is just
plain fun to say, and I don’t
care where you’ré from.

Yankee. Despite what
you may believe, not a base-
ball player from New York
who wears pinstripes and
playsin The House That Ruth
Built. Instead, the term re-
fers to those people unfortu-
nate enough to have been
born, grown up, or ever been
in any way associated with
the tundra-like land north of
the Mason-Dixon line:
Note: Just because we’re
Yankees doesn’t mean our
geographical opposites are

We're Yankees. They’re

them.
