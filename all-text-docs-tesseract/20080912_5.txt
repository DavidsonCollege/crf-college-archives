Not all bunnies are cute and loveable. In
fact, as Fred Wolf’s recently released “The
House Bunny” reveals, some can be down-
right dreadful. The movie, set up to be a hi-
larious rendition of a Cinderella story, was a
disappointment in more ways than one.

The girls of the socially inept Zeta Alpha
Zeta sorority become sexy princesses with
the help of Shelley, a recently evicted Play-
boy bunny. The plot fails to thicken as the
girls attempt to overturn an evil sorority on
campus.

Poor acting, Over-exaggerated charac-
ters and downright dumb scene sequences
removed any hope that the movie may have
had to be a hit. Shelley, played by Anna Faris
from “Scary Movie” and “The Hot Chick,”
was an extreme form of the stereotypical
“dumb blonde’ with hair, heels and breasts all
unnaturally high.

Her lack of common sense was over-
played to the greatest extent. And, after only
a few minutes into the movie, it was no lon-
ger funny.

Shelley finds a new home and family
in the Zeta Alpha Zeta Sorority after Hugh
Hefner boots her from the Playboy mansion.
The misfit Zetas have unique issues ranging
from intense geekiness to a full body brace
to an unplanned pregnancy. Shelley takes it
upon herself to convert the freaks and geeks
into mini Playboy bunnies in order to get 30
pledges and save the failing sorority.

The optimistic leader of the girls, Natalie,

is played by Emma Stone of “Superbad.” Un-
fortunately, her good acting and cute person-
ality are overshadowed by the unnecessarily
blatant nerdiness that composes her charac-
ter. Natalie encourages the girls to listen to
Shelley’s advice, trading facial piercings and
pigtails for highlights and water bras.

The other Zeta sisters include familiar
faces. Kat Dennings of “The 40 Year Old Vir-
gin” plays Mona, while the “Cheetah Girls”

Kiely Williams plays the role of Lily. Rumer
Willis makes her first major movie appear-
ance as Joanne, the girl with the back brace.
Unfortunately, Willis’ debut is spoiled with
a horrific scene where she chases after her
crush Forrest Gump style as Shelley shouts,
“Run Joanne, Run!” As her body brace be-
gins to fall off, the entire theater lets out a
groan in unison.

The weekend of Aug. 22 marked not only
the beginning of a new semester for David-
son students, but also the opening of the new-
est chocolate shop, Davidson Chocolate Co.

Owners John and Sue Elliot now pro-
vide this small town with chocolate truffles,
Hershey’s ice cream, milkshakes, ice cream
floats, flavored teas and hot coffee. With a
convenient location adjacent to Harris Teeter,
this shop allows easy access to vital goodies
for Sunday mornings and final exams. Even

Valentine’s Day has become much easier,”

with perfect treats for yourself or your sweet-
heart.

“The first two weeks have been
very busy,” Sue Elliot said.
And with their opening
celebration this week-
end, the couple,
along with their
son, John Jr., have
plenty to do.

The — grand
opening of Da-
vidson Chocolate
Co. kicks off
this Friday
and lasts gf
through
Sunday
with
raffles,
draw-
ings, tours of
the kitchen and choco-
late-making demonstra-
tions on Saturday. Best
of all, this Sunday is
“officially” ice cream
cone day, with 50% off

all scoops while supplies last.

Treat yourself for surviving “First Night
Down” with a chocolate truffle, which costs
between one and two dollars. You can choose
from a wide array of flavors ranging from
raspberry and key lime pie to Kahlua, hot
chili and cappuccino.

End a shopping trip to Harris Teeter with
an ice cream cone for the road in traditional
vanilla, chocolate or strawberry flavors. Or,
if you’re feeling a bit adventurous, sample
a more interesting mix, such as P, Nutty
Cone Craziness (butter pecan, caramel,
fudge, pea- nuts and

tas make it almost impossible for the audi-
ence to get to know each girl, which limits
the audience’s emotional reaction to their
success and failures.

After their extreme makeovers, the girls
are ready to take on the evil preppy soror-
ity. Shelley’s hard work pays off; when the
time comes for underclassmen to submit
their pledges, Zeta Alpha Zeta has more than
enough to keep their charter. Later, the girls
are confronted with the task of selecting their
new sisters. They become judgmental and
cruel as they watch a slideshow of. prospec-
tive recruits. The girls realize that their new
personalities reflect those of the girls they
used to hate.

The Zetas decide to reclaim some of
their individuality, and in the end, are able
to create the type of sorority they had always
hoped for. There are a few more bumps along
the way as they send out their bids, and in the
end, Shelley is forced to give an awful and ir-
relevant speech in front of the college’s board
in order to get the girls’ 30 pledges. In the
end, everyone gets exactly what they wanted.
The Zetas get to keep their house and Shel-
ley finds a new home. She also lands a boy-
friend after a sadly unfunny courtship with
the intelligent philanthropist Oliver, played
by Colin Hanks.

Overall, “The House Bunny” offers plen-
ty of eye candy and laughs, though nothing
intellectually stimulating. If you’re looking
for something to take your mind off of chem-
istry problem sets, this is the perfect mind-
less escape.

$2.35, but your Davidson Cat Card knocks a
nice 10% off the bill.

Hot teas and coffees will be perfect for
when the weather cools down, and the Elli-
ots said that special seasonal flavors, such as
“pumpkin spice” tea in October or “snowman
tea” in the winter, will be available when the
temperature changes. Or grab a quality gift
to send to relatives for the holidays, like a
box of fudge, chocolate turtles or chocolate
dipped fruit, all around $25 per pound.
There are so many reasons
for taking a few minutes
to visit the Davidson

‘Chocolate Co., and
according to the El-
liots, that was exactly
their goal.

ness, the couple had
been working to open a

Bed and Breakfast.

“My realtor told us,

‘let’s go see a chocolate
shop,” Sue Elliot said.
“We hadn’t thought about
that. It was something we
couldn’t resist.”
