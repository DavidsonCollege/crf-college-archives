Enharmonic Variations:
August

When all I wanted was

to lay your slender body

on a strip of warm sand
to drowse

by silver waves, a gull drifted
along the air

where it drowsed
half upon the wavesâ€™ silver body

half upon the sand
stripped of cloud

moving Betsy Norman
in warm drifts

its gulls

whose wings curve in
slender strips
down warm air
moving
over drowsy bodies
wave into sand
into waves

with my breath vou streich
in slender curves
drifting around me
unwanted of sand, wave, sky
silvering our bodies: Pistons
wings moving down
together
Two

our flesh evaporating in heated discourse.
We drink of the imagined potence of our ambrosia
turning softly to wine
and back again to water.

It is not that flames die

only that candles melt

for we no longer imagine the strength of this flame
but its true dancing

and our feet are heavy with sleep.

Rain leaves no smokey traces

and in time the sun will warm her unsteady children.
They will flame again from ambrosia
and dance.

Oh how they will dance!

Their fire must be a nova

and its heat call forth the rain.

It can only fall so heavily

before it is an ocean

nor can a candle burn so long

as to be eternal.
