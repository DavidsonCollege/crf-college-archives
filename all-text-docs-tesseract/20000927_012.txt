Davidson’s tenth in a row dating back to last
year, and improved this yearis record to 3-0.

The Wildcats struck first, on a 43-yard |

field goal by Daniel Hanks with 1:13 left in
the first quarter for a 3-0 lead. Throughout
the first half, Davidson was able to advance
the ball but struggled to score.

The Cats stretched the lead to 10-0 after

quarterback Paul Nichols scored
on a one-yard run with 32 sec- .
onds left in the half. The Wasps
quickly responded to get right
back in the game with a 44-yard
touchdown pass from Shannon
Johnson to Dorsey Hooker as
the first half expired to trim the
Davidson lead to10-7.

Neither team was able to score
in the third quarter, setting up
the dramatics of the final stanza.
The Wildcats were able to in-
crease their lead to 17-7 early in
the quarter as junior Ward
Gibson found paydirt from 13
yards out to finish off a 12-play

Davidson had a chance to effectively end the
game, but Gibson was stopped on fourth-and-
goal from the | and the Wasps gained posses-
sion.

Emory and Henry proceeded to go on an
11-play, 99-yard driveSand close the gap to
17-14 with only 4:52 to go. The Wildcats

were then forced to punt and rely on their -

defense to finish off the game.

The Wasps looked very impressive as they
marched down the field looking for the tie or
the win. Using a short passing game, Emory
and Henry advanced the football with appar-
ent ease.

Then came “The Hit.”

As Emory & Henry receiver Richie Rode

- sive back Adam Elmore delivered a crushing
blow. Rode’s helmet flew about five feet in

the air and he was forced to leave the game
with two cracked molars. Though Rode

and corralled the pass for his second intercep-

game winning streak.

While upset that they were unable to put
away the Wasps earlier, the Wildcats defi-
nitely have a lot to feel good about. One mark
of a great team is to be able to make big plays
down the stretch. The Cats clearly did that on
Saturday. >

Davidson has the week off this Saturday,
with two weeks to prepare to avenge last
season’s 40-0 loss to Morehtad State on

October 7.

Game Notes:

After earning I-AA Special Teams Player
of the Week honors the last two weeks,
Ryan Crawford earned the honor for his
defense this week. Crawford intercepted

Anytime the Wildcat defense is on the
field, you don’t have to look hard to find
Ryan Crawford. Just locate the football and
Crawford will be somewhere in the vicinity.

- Inhis last year as a Wildcat, Crawford, also

known as the defensive “playmaker,” contin-

ues to be a catalyst for his team and a source

of both frustration and admiration for oppo-

nents. In just the first three games of the

_ season, Crawford, has been aone man wreck-

ing crew, returning the opening kickoff for

the first touchdown of the season, blocking 3

punts and a field goal, and tallying two inter-
ceptions. One contributing factor to
Crawford’s success is Davidson’s strong de-
fensive line, which shuts down most running
games and forces teams to pass to him. ;

Success on the field, bowever} is far from
new for the North Carolina native. His su-
perb junior season earned him a spot on the I-
AA All Independent Team as well as Associ-
ated Press I-AA First Team All-America
accolades, making him the only other Wild-
cat to do so other than Johnny Mackorell.

As the season progresses, Crawford will
undoubtedly continue to solidify his position
as an eminent defensive player as well as a
force on special teams. He is already on pace
to surpass his interception mark from last
career as a whole. sa

In light of Crawford’ s recent dominance of
opponents, I offer one iicceicnms to oppos-
ing teams: BEWARE.

To Mr. Crawford, I simply pose one we ques-
tion: NFL?
