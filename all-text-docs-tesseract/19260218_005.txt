Definite Point System Recommended to
Student Body in Suggested Amendment

A number of radical changes in the point
system governing positions held by students
in the different student organizations were
included in recommendations presented to the
student body last Thursday morning by R. B.
Parker, representing the Student Council
and Omicron Delta Kappa.

The old point system, proposed some years
ago, had become obsolete, and the changes
were recommended with the view of making
the point system more practical. This old
system was tacitly accepted by the student
body, but was never officially adopted. It
is proposed that, if the new regulations are
accepted, they be incorporated into the con-
stitution.

The points given for some positions will
be abolished, while some will be increased and
others lowered. The proposed changes “are
as follows:

1. All 2-point positions shall he abolished.

2. The positions of President of the Senior

and Editor of the Annual shall be in-

creased to 3-point positions.
