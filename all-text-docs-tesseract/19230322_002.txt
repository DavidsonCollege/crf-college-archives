THE

DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 22, 1923

ESSESEESSEREEREEEEEEEESEEEEEEE

Armand London Currie of Fayetteville,
N. C., now engaged’ in whipping the Wild-
cat nine into shape for its opening gathes
with Oak Ridge next Friday and Saturday,
is a man who is known by every Davidson
man from the class of ’18 through the class
of '26,

Buck entered Davidson in the fall of ’17
and the next spring pitched his way to a
monogram to which three stars were later
added. For four years Buck served as a
moundsman and is now working on material
to fill the place out of which he stepped two
seasons ago.

During his college days Buck was an
all-round man. He showed his ability along
literary lines by winning the Fresh-Soph
Declaimer’s Medal, along athletic lines by
his work on the diamond and his popularity
and ability as a leader by his service as
President of the Student Body. ~

After graduation, Buck pitched during the
summer and in the fall returned to David-
son to take up his work as principal of the
Davidson High School. When Dwight
Chalmers resigned as “Y” secretary, Buck
was secured and no beter selection could
have been made for the position. Pleasant
and genial, Buck is a friend to everyone,
admired and respected wherever he goes.

When the question of a baseball coach
came up this spring, Buck was the man to
fill the position and in his dual capacity of
“Y” secretary and baseball coach, he is
working with the best interests of David-
son always at heart.

After several weeks of practice it looks
+s tho’ our chances for a successful team on
he diamond. depend on the pitching staff.
The players look weak at the bat and show
a special tendency to do a a Casey against
curve ball twirling. But if Hunter, Bou-
shee, Sorrells and a couple of new men
come through a good season will result.

The weilders of the cat-gut are out full
force and hope to repeat their victories of
last year. With Hugh Bradley, state sin-
gles champion and a member ‘of the cham-
ous team is being formed. Several tennis
pion doubles team, as a nucleus, a danger-
matches with other colleges will be held
on the hill and everyone will have a chance
to see the Wildcat knights of the clay court
in action.

Monk Younger will certainly have plenty
of material out of which to build a basket-
ball team next season. _Warhoss Mauze
has announced his intention of returning
for another season on the pine boards and
this means that there will be eight letter
men fighting for places on the team. That
will be a merry scrap. And don’t forget
this year’s scrubs.

To get a smooth working infield that is
dependable both at bat and in the field seems
to be Coach Currie’s greatest task. In
spite of the fact that it would move an all-
state man out of his position we would like
to see ’em line up for the first game with
Covington at third, McKay at short, Craw-
ford at.second and Boushee on first.

The news that we are to have three full
ime coaches for next year was certainly’
a sweet morsel for followers of Davidson
athletics. It shows that the authorities have
at last recognized a long felt need and that
Monk Younger is already making plans for
next season,

We play Carolina in Gastonia Easter
Monday and a large number of students fill
be ond hand to see the tussel. The Wild-
cats have several.old scores to settle up
and will have their claws showing. ‘The
last time we frocked the Tar Heels in base-
ball was in 1921, when Pat Crawford's
home run with two. on base put a 9 to 5 vic-
tory in the Wildcats’ bat bags. Time to
repeat.

NICHES IN THE WILDCAT\ |
HALL OF FAME

One of the greatest athletes who ever,
wore the Red and Black is Dewitt Klutz
of Chester, South Carolina. Entering Da-
vidson in the fall of 1907, Klutz won a berth
at end on one of the greatest teams the
Presbyterians have ever turned out, and in
the spring proved his versatility by making
the baseball and track teams.

The next year Rabbit was a fixture at end
and starred in the first grid contest between
Wake -Forest and Davidson, which the
Wildcats tucked away, 31-4. Carolina was
held to a scoreless tie, and Clemson went
down once more before the Red and Black.

Rabbit was elected captain of the -909
team, but early in the season broke his leg
and was unable to play during the remainder
of the season. Five feet eleven inches tall
and weighing 64 pounds, Klutz had an ideal
build for an end. On the track he was a
10-second man and on the gridiron was
given many. an opportunity to show his
speed, being selected all-Southern end.

DeWitt was re-elected captain of the

long time.

vidson. ‘There are those points about the
record, however, that keeps it from being
disgraceful. There is Kimzey’s noble stand
at Trinity; Captain Cromartie’s record of
not yet having ‘had a fall chalked up against
him, and Lindamood’s even break on matches
to ‘uphold the account considerably.

The fact that the score in wrestling does
not show how close the matches were tells
the tale of the matches lost.

The majority of the matches lost by Da-
vidson were lost after they had been
wrestled to a draw in the initial nine min-
ute period. ‘The team showed up well in
the Carolina and V. M. I. meets and receiv-
ed much commendation for the good work
done at these places.

EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT
PROSPECTS IN TENNIS

Under the able managership of Harry
Price, another splendid tennis schedule has
been arranged for the coming season. Car-
olina and Trinity have the Wildcats on their
schedule for the last of April, while matches
with Wake Forest and State are pending.

Returning from this invasion of the old
North State, the Wildcat racqueteers will
have very little rest before they will be call-
ed on to show their wares at the Olympics,
which are to be held in Durham again May‘
4th and Sth.

Last year Davidson came away from the
State meet with all sorts of cups and honors
tagging along with them. ‘The State cham-
pionship was won in both the singles and
doubles, This year the prospects are bright
indeed. Captain Hugh Bradley is deter-
mined to go another third of the way to-
ward keeping for his own the beautiful sil-
ver cup which he now holds as State col-
legiate champion. - In the doubles Hugh and
Harry ought to be invincible. One more
big Teas@ft why our prospects this year are
so bright is due to the fact that we have
a real coach in the person of J. B. Whit-
ener. Joc knows the grame from start to
finish. He is a Trinity alumnus, and is
guilty of knocking Hugh Bradley out of
the singles championship in 1921.

Besides having a coach this year, the ten-
nis aspirants will have the oportunity of
seeing in action on the screen some Sat-
urday night world famous champs, such as
