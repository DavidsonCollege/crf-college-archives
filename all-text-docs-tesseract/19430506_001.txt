Pan-flellenic
Eleets Booth
As President

New Pan-Hellenic Council
Members Choose Officers
For Next Year:

ELECT GAITHER, GWYNN

All Members Of Council Tak-
ing Advanced R. O. T. C.
Shep Booth, representative of

‘Kappa Sigma fraternity, has been

chosen president of the new Pan-

Hellenic council.

Other officers elected by the
council are Bob Gaither, Pi Kappa
Phi representative, secretary, and
Gwynn, representative of
Sigma Phi Epsilon, treasurer.

Future Dark

The future of the council is at
best uncertain, since several fra-
ternities may not function as ac-
tive chapters next year, and the
possibility. of having pan-hellenic
dances is slim. Every member of
the new council is a member of ad-
vanced ROTC and will not be back
to assume his duties next year.

Members of the new council are:
Frank Carter, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon; Bob Welsh, Beta Theta Pi;
Rhea Preston, Phi Gamma Delta;
Teensy Hodges, Pi Kapp Alpha;
Bob Gaither, Pi Kappa Phi; Red
Burke, Kappa Alpha; Shep Booth,
Kappa Sigma; Deane Watson, Phi
Delta Theta; and Price Gwynn,
Sigma Phi Epsilon.

‘Y’ Gift Fund
Is Distributed

Christian Education For
The Negros’ Benefits

Y. M. C. A. officials announce
that $2,000 contributed in the
Christmas Gift Fund has been dis-
tributed to those for whom it was
given for the Christian education
of the negro.

Part of the money was sent for
the use of Charles Tyler, a young
colored minister-who spoke at Dav-
idson during the drive. He is work-
ing’ among members of his race in
Birmingham, Ala.

i Literature

Another portion of the money
was sent for the purchase of liter-
ature to be-used in the Christian
education of negroes. This order
for literature is being handled by
the Presbyterian Committee of
Publication.

At the special request of Charles
Tyler, some money is being donat-
ed to Stillman Institute for im-
proving their dormitories. Stillman
is _a college for negroes that is
supported by the Presbyterian
Church and has many ministers
among its alumni.

Not Closed

Books for this past year’s fund
have not yet been closed, as there
are still some uncollected pledges.
All additional funds received will
be sent to Stillman Institute to
aid them in improving their phy-
sical plant.

Alf Taylor, head of the Y. M.
C. A. department of world evangel-
ism, assisted by Welford Hobbie,
was in charge of raising this years
gift fund. It was the largest in
the history of these funds, being
several hundred dollars more than
the largest previous gifts.

LAST ISSUE

_ This issue of the Davidsonian
is the last of the current school
year.

Every year the final issue of
the Davidsonian appears about
two weeks before the beginning
of the examination period. This
is necessary because members
of the staff are generally so
busy with scholastic duties at
this time that it is impractical
to continue publications. The
last issue must also come out
soon enough to give the busi-
ness staff time to wind up its
collections before the end of
school.

Since exams start a week
earlier this year, the final issue
appears a week sooner than
usual,

but will not bé here next year. The
breaking of the precident gave him
the privilege of putting out one
issue.

MOTHERS’ DAY PROCESSIONAL TO CHURCH

Esquire Contributes To’ May
Issue Which Features
Pictures

Scripts ’n Pranks, Davidson hu-
mor magazine, will make its final
appearance of the year as the May
issue__is- mailed to students the
latter part of next week.

Highlighting this issue will be
a special surprise feature furnish-
ed Scripts ’n Pranks through the
cooperation of Esquire. This feat-
ure will be artistic in nature, and
Howell Morrow, editor, states that
he feels sure it will be favorably
received by the student body.

Army Life Pictured ”
In view of the fact that nearly
all the Juniors and Seniors will
soon enter the armed forces, it
seemed appropriate that one ar-
ticle should appear concerning the
transition from college life to that
of the army. The article which will
fill this need is “Never Again, or
Confessions of a Shave-Tail,”’ writ-
ten by Lt. Sam R. Spencer. This
sketch of Lt. Spencer’s first ex-
periences in army life is written
along the lines of “See Here, Pvt.
Hargrove.”
The cover for the coming, issue
was designed and drawn by Don

Holland. Another art feature will
be “Bike Types” by Miss Clara
Smith.

Lana Turner
There will also be a reappear-
ance of Davidson’s Blackout Queen,
Miss Lana Turner, who was select-
ed by:a student poll last fall. Re-
sults of this poll were announced
in the Holidays Issue of Scripts 'n

Pranks, This time, however, Miss
Turner will appear in a> bathing
suit.

Sharing the spotlight on the%

short story interest will be stories
by Ed Erwin and W. H. Sprunt.

Poems

The spring issue will include
three poems. One is a parody, “Get
All-You Can,” by Bill Styron.
This poem is especially addressed
to the recently departed boys of
the E.R. C. A second poem will be
“Resurrection,” written by Charlie
Brockman and _ illustrated by Jim
Elliott. The third will be “Scripts
'n Pranks Won’t Win the War.”

In normal years the senio? edi-
tor publishes four issues of the
magazine. This ptecident was
broken for the first time this year
to allow Howell Morrow to put out
an issue. He was elected to the
position of editor of the magazine
