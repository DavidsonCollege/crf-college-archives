Only 60%

By IAN HumMeEL

At the beginning of this year,
Davidson embarked on a program
designed to facilitate recycling on
campus. The program included
placing containers throughout the
campus and residence halls in
which virtually all recyclables (ev-
erything excluding wet waste and
glass) could be placed together.

According to Tony Owens,
Building Services Manager for the

of recyclables getting into blue containers’

Physical Plant and head of the re-
cycling program, it is yet difficult
to predict what the ultimate level
of success for the program will be:
This is due to the fact that the
recycling compactor necessary for
the program was connected only
very recently.

Owens said that the
recyclables that had been com-
pacted thus far were “looking
good” in that the students were not
allowing very much wet waste to
get into the blue bags. He also

od

said, however, that early approxi-
mations showed that as much a
60% of the recyclables are not
making their way into the contain-
ers.

In addition to the obvious en-
vironmental gains of recycling, the
aim of the program is economic.
The program was designed to be
more student-friendly as opposed
to the programs of the past in which
it was necessary for the students to
separate the recyclables them-
selves.

The walk proceeded to the
cross-country trails, where Dr.
Grant pointed out insects and
patches of growth in a fieldwork
exercise.

According to Grant, a biol-
ogy professor, ecology is not lim-
ited to the exotic rainforests or the
tundra; it is all around us.

“Into the Streets” is anational
program designed to introduce stu-
dents to thoughtful community
service and problem- solving
through partnership.

The program was brought to
Davidson by an ITS coalition con-
sisting of students, faculty mem-
bers, and residents of the commu-
nity.

Many more events are still to

come, including volunteer work at
the Senior Nutrition Center and
the Uptown Men’s Shelter, a CROP
walk, Fun Run, Community Lunch,
and Highway Clean-Up Day.

All students are encouraged
to attend any or all events.

Junior Liz Boehmler, chair of
the environmental committee, says
that “Into the Streets” is “a real
moving and exciting program.”

Consumer Protection

Committee gets green light
CPE will be steered by Dervan and Ch'ng

Davidson’s first Consumer
Protection Committee (CPC) is
now official. Last Tuesday areso-
lution regarding the committee’s
purpose and responsibilities was
adopted by the SGA Senate and
two CPC co-chairs were approved.

Senior Lucian Dervan will
serve as the Senate Chairman of
the committee, and Sophomore
Toh Hean Ch’ng will fill the
committee’s Student Body Chair
position.

The CPC hopes to provide an
organized voice for student opin-
ion and concerns regarding the
business organizations which pro-
__ Vide services to the Davidson Col-

lege student body.

Says Dervan, who came up
with the idea for the CPC this sum-
mer, “We hope to get an active
group of committed [CPC] mem-
bers.”

Committee sign-ups will be
held until Friday in the Union and
in Chambers.

The CPC will collect feed-—

back from students about how they
feel about companies on campus
as well as recommendations about
these companies. In addition, says
Dervan, the CPC will compile sta-
tistical evidence or hard proof re-
garding service problems.

“We want numbers to back up
student opinions and stories,” says
Dervan, who continues, “We are
not passing judgement on these

companies ... [rather] we hope to
figure out what’s really going on
with monopolies on campus.”

As CPC co-chairs, Dervan and
Ch’ng will serve a two year term.
At the end of this academic year,
the CPC will issue a report on its
findings. Subsequent reports will
be produced every two years.

Dervan says he “voiced inter-
est in being the Senate Chair [of
the CPC].” Ch’ng was “one of the
first people I approached” about
the student body chair position.

Ch’ng had already written a
report on the competitiveness of
the international rates of
Davidson’s long distance phone
carrier, BTI.  ~

“He was our top choice for the
position,” says Dervan.

The expected increase in effi-
ciency would decrease the amount
of waste products, which would
both decrease landfill costs as well
as increase the amount of money
the college could make from the
sale of recyclables.

Owens believes that it is an
“excellent program,” but for it to

prove itself profitable relies on stu-
dent desire to cooperate.

Meredith Judy, a coordinator
of the student Recycling Commit-
tee, also emphasized the impor-
tance of student involvement, say-
ing that for students the “best as-
sistance is being responsible about
recycling.”

side and escorted to campus by car.
Lee then returned to her room
where she received a call from the
police, who, according to Lee, had
been informed that Neigert had
knives and had threatened her. She
told them what had happened.
After hanging up, she checked
her voice mail and heard a mes-
sage left to her from Neigert. “Iam
the guy you hit,” he says, “... next
time I see you I’m g[oing to] crack
your neck and break your face ...
you are going to f—— die ... When
I am sober I will still remember
this... You hit the wrong person ...
next time you see me you may not
be alive ... 1am wasted now but I
will not forget this ... you will f—
—die, understand that, understand
that, ... maybe you should transfer
out before I get a hold of your ass
... girls do not f——ng hit me ...
I will see you f——ing later. ”

Neigert.says be,igeg.deh remem-.. seem:

ber leaving the message.

At this point, Lee forwarded
this message to campus police, who
she says encouraged her to drive to
Charlotte and get a warrant for
Neigert’s arrest. She did so around
6:30 in the morning.

Apparently, after leaving the
message for Lee, Neigert wandered
around his hall on second Belk.
According to sophomore L.P. Hill,
another resident of thathall, Neigert
walked in and out of Hill’s room
and mumbled something unintelli-
gible. Hill told him to go to bed.

Meanwhile, Machon, who had
been at the party earlier when the
scuffle occurred, was walking up
the back stairs of Belk toward his
room on fourth Belk when he saw
Neigert “waving two knives, a
butterfly knife and a Swiss Army
knife.” He said that Neigert was
mentioning Lee and trying to get to
her room.

Machon asked him where he
was going, and tried to calm him.
“T knew that he was up to no good
with two knives in his hand. I was
really concerned.”

He says that Neigert seemed
calm after the two spoke for five to
ten minutes. However, when
Machon “unconsciously moved
forward” Neigert sliced the top of

ae«e Machor*s-hand with the butterfly

_ knife, cutting the tendon in his
index finger and chipping part of
the bone. “I wasn’t trying to take
the knife away, but he might have
thought I was,” says Machon.

At this point, according to
Machon, Neigert dropped the
knives and took his shirt off to
wrap Machon’s bleeding wound.

Hill was walking into the stair-
well while all of this was happen-
ing. “I saw Chris talking to Rob,

trying to calm him down, and it
looked like [the cutting] just sort of
happened. Rob -was extremely
apologetic, saying that it was all
his fault. Chris wasn’t mad or
angry, he just wanted to get his
finger taken care of.”

Machon, Neigert, and Hill all
rushed to the infirmary, where staff
took care of Machon’s wound.
According to Neigert, he walked
out of the infirmary and was picked
up by Officer Moore. Neigert spent
much of the night in custody at the
Davidson College police station
and was then arrested and taken to
a Charlotte jail. A friend bailed
him out with a $300 fine.

Machon received around 30
stitches in his hand. He is taking
heavy sedatives, and is not. sure
how long it will be before he can do
schoolwork. He filed a police re-
port, but maintains that he will not
press charges. “If [Neigert] had
been sober,” Machon says, “he
wouldn’t have done this ... he

thee
guess ... All I wanted to do was
stop him from going over [to Lee’s
room] ... there are no excuses for
it, but I wanted to give him a break,
because the charges would have
been assault with a deadly illegal
weapon ... he would have spent
time in jail, ” says Machon.

Neigert says his “drinking has
stopped for good” and admits to
Lee’s charge of “communicating
a threat.” The trial is set for No-
vember 10. He expects to receive
a fine, and says that it doesn’t look
like he will have to leave Davidson.

“The worst part was hurting
my friend. I learned a big lesson,”
he says. Neigert’s mother called
Machon on Sunday from Caracas,
Venezuela and offered to pay for
the surgery.

Neigert feels “sorry that the
whole thing happened,” saying that
“T never drank before I came here.
I was drinking [on Friday], and
that was my fault ... it was the
worst night of my life.”

He also commented that he
“didn’t know that knives were ille-
gal [in North Carolina]” and he
was “vent[ing] out depression and
frustration.” He was angry that
Lee had shoved him because it “is
very offensive to a man if a girl hits
him in South America.”

Associate Dean of Students
Leslie Marsicano cannot comment
about the case while it is still being
investigated, but says that making
threats and assaulting are Code of
Responsibility violations, and that
punishments up to indefinite sus-
pension are possible ramifications
for these transgressions. “The |
Honor Council decides whether a
student can or cannot be part of the
community.”
