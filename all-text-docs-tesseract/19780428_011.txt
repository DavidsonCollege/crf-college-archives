Track eyes relays.

Marshall University hosts
this year’s Southern Conference
Relays on April 28-29, anu
Davidson’s 6-1 track team is
hoping to substantially improve
upon ‘last year’s 8th place
finish. Several Wildcats should
perform well.

Senior Jarry ‘‘Orca’’ Taylor
probably has the best shot at an
individual title in his specialty,
the hammer, and is also entered
in the discus.

Doug Horn, who has recently
shown signs of rounding into
form, will be running the 1500
and the steeplechase. Freshman
Bart Landess has run a 4:09 and
is also in the 1500.

Hurdler Dick Jones has the

3rd best time going into the
110-meter highs, and the fresh-
man will compete in the 440-in-
termediates in addition.

Sprinter Robert Alston has
recently joined the team and
could be a factor in the 100 and
200. He won both events deci-
sively in last week’s meet with
Emory-Henry.

Saturday marks Coty Pinck-
ney’s last intercollegiate outing,
and the senior plans to depart
with a flourish by running both
5000 and 10,000 meters, a la
Lasse Viren. He could conceiva-
bly win the 10,000 and place in
the top three in the 5000.
Pinkney ends his career as
undoubtedly the finest runner
ever at Davidson.

flaunts first tra

y virtue of a 7-6 scrimmage
mie over Dartus Tunic on
Sunday. Eddie ‘“‘Manny Trillo”

Nicholson sparkled for Mac- ©

Fleet as he helped to pull off the
first double play in MacFleet’s
long history. Meanwhile, the
players from DT claim that the
game was only a scrimmage and
that they really weren’t trying.

Big’T and the Oxytocins went
to find Who’s On Second and
then beat him 13-3. Big T is
being ripped apart by a bitter
contest between players Ed
Ferren, Sandy Tarlton, and
Scott Harbottle to see which
one Can grow the first noticeable
patch of facial hair. (After three
weeks, most observers think
Ferren may have some.)

We Funk vaulted to our
number 4 spot as they streng-
thened their team with a trade
that sent Bill Sherwood to the

defunct Cannonballs for Ernie
Reigel and Rich Perkey. Perk
and Ernest made it all worth-
while for We Funk as they lead
the team to a 12 to 5 romp of the
Four Skins. The Lizard Kickers
won their protest last week with
the Bongs and then smoked the
War Kiwis 7-5.

Presto’s Grille tuned up for
their upcoming game with Dar-
tus Tunic as they nipped Char-
lie’s Angels 10-9. The Whizz
Kids utilized the brutal blocks
of Mike Peskosky to nip the
SAE’s 7-5 and move into out
number 8 spot. Bone made a
courtesy appearance in our top
ten as the acquired rookie
outfielder Gifford Piercy and
destroyed the Bongs 8-2.

selves into children of the

in another protest. This time,

Act II got p. o.’d at. the SPE’s
for palming spikes in a closely
fought loss. Said SPE player T.
Rick Kelly, ‘‘Okay, so we
caught a few and threw them
back in their faces. That's
nothing to bitch about.’’ In
other games, Magical Mystery
Tour stung Well Hung 15-7,
15-4 and Slauoul struggled past
Punk Patrol, 18-16, 9-15, 15-13.
