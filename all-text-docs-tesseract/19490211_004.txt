crimson and gold. Congratulations
are on order for caters Guthery and
Roddey, who engineered the food
and drinks. We were glad to have
as our guests Tony Tucker, Her-
bert Middleton, Tommy Langford,
and Bill Sechnest. Brother Dick
Baxter’s heart-throb served as the

K.A. Rose ‘of the occasion.

The week got off to a fine start
Monday night whenethe brothers,
ever mindful of the pledges’ wel-
fare and happiness, devised various
of amusements for them.
Pledge Bryan Robinson spent some
time learning about the intricacies
of the local division of the Southern
Railway—good thing he and the
evening freight to Statesville didn’t
get to the trestle at the same time.
Pledges Buckey and Sommers man-
aged to break into print in Thurs-
day’s Observer, along with a typical
Travistian story. The next few days
found all the pledges immensely en-
joying their roles as cigarette and
chewing gum machines. The
brothers also found their music dur-
ing meals a delightful aid to diges-
tion. A visitor to the house Thurs-
day night could have seen Chief
Window-Washer Chuck Kirby di-
recting his accomplished gang of
demolition experts among the usual
clouds of dust and glass cleaner
aroused by the annual spring clean-
ing. After these days of rest and
relaxation, all will be in top shape
for initiation this week.

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

The Mid-Winter gave
much excitement to the week-end
and the Sig Alphs were in the midst
of it all. We not only had better
food at the boarding house, but also
