April lis also the final deadline for mail-

ing entries in the third annual national col-

by Collegiate Digest—a contest that is held
annually to select pictures ‘for the rotogray-

each spring.

To compete for national recognition and
money prizes, all students of Davidson Col-

mediately. Enter your pictures in one of
the following divisions: still life, scenes,
candid, portraits or “coHege life.”

Next time your club meets, or
you have a family reunion, list the
names of 20 of those present. Let
them be members of your family,
relatives, close friends.

Look well upon their happy
faces, for at the present rate one
out of that 20 will be killed or in-

| jured in an automobile accident
| within the next five years.

It may be you, or your daughter,
or your mother, or perhaps your
sweetheart. _ ivan: Stamens

It may be a minor injury: it may
be a crippling, disfiguring casu-
alty; it may be death. f

These figures are based on the

{drive safely, the av

law of averages, assuming that the
annual total of traffic deaths and
injuries reported by The Travelers
Insurance Company for 1938 will
not increase in any of the next five
“years.

Fortunately, you and your rel-
atives and friends can evade the
law of averages. You can beat it by
being above the average in your
walking and driving habits. If you
and your group of 20 will walk and
ige injury
probably will not strike in the next
five years; it may not strike in the
next 20 years; it may, in fact, never

strike,
