10—The Davidsonian—March 20, 1981

In Veritate Magna Vis

After last week's Webster's new abridged version of the Brick
Brothers and the Doughboys. we felt we owed you a little bit
longer work so we've decided to spend 15 minutes on this piece.
We also have decided to add our own special tidbit this
week — an up-to-the-minute look at today’s newsmakers and the
words they are making news with. Here's the important
schooth:

1. Ronald Reagan, when asked about the equity of his
proposed economic policies—

“We aren't acting totally in the

The Brick Bros. interests of the big oil com-
panies. We want to help the
and the | small oil companies. too. We

hope that Sinclair. Amoco, and
Phillips 66 will be able to

Doughboys
strangle the market just like

|\“Ticket to Ride,” “Tar-

Exxon and Gulf do. We also don't want to discriminate against
coloreds; we respect them as equals and watch many NBA
basketball games. Nancy has also quit donating money to the
KKK.”

2. Robert H. Knight, Governor and Coach of Indiana—‘‘Hey.
let’s not be afraid to fry a little flesh every once in a while. Our
only mistake was that we could have used Judy's body in a
bonfire before the Iowa game. As it is, we just wasted a totally
burnable corpse."

3. Steven Judy, Indiana State Torch—‘‘I never got anything I
wanted in life, but I always did like fast food. Now. I am a fast
food. Anybody want some french fries?’’

4. Alexander Haig, Secretary of S.W.A.T.—‘‘It's ridiculous to
say that El Salvador is another Vietnam. That's like saying a
camel is like a dromedary. All you have to do is go in tough and
bomb them into a democratic form of government. It worked in
Korea and will work all over the world. Idi Amin told me it
would.”’

Now that you're enlightened on the world situation. we're
going to move on to another totally original feature, Faces in the
Crowd. These people all have faces and they want vou to know
them so hey. get to know them and maybe vou all can pet
married and have a family and attend each others’ funerals.

FACES IN THE CROWD

Richard Terry: This senior from Atlanta,
Georgia holds the worlds record for most
golf balls held in the mouth at one time,
11. This record was set at the Atlanta
Country Club where Richard works in
the summer as a golf ball washer. During
the school year, Richard counts the
number of pickles that John Davis sucks
on.

Joby Merten: This senior from Auburn,
Alabama holds the Davidson record for
most tests failed in a career, 36. This

errors he made at shortstop last year and
when divided by 28. it gives his GPA.
Joby attributes his record-breaking per-
formance to an unfamiliarity with
Southern ways and a rare learning
disability known as perplexia.

Karen and Richard Car- ¢
penter: This sibling sing- .
ing duo has had hit after
hit since coming to David-
son, their first being,
appropriately = enough,
‘We've Only Just

Begun.”’ They've followed
that with “Close to You,”

baby Loves You,’’ and ‘Mr. Postman Gets Off in Rock Hill.”

Publications seek readers and material

By JENNY O’'BRIANT
Staff Writer and
JOHN KROTCHKO

Features Editor
Twice a year, The Davidson

Miscellany and Hobart’s Park
provide students and faculty—
as well as outsiders —a place for
their creative literary efforts.

The idle stacks of the two
literary magazines in the Union
and the library indicate
weak student support, however.
Students are apparently too
busy for extracurricular reading
or simply not interested in what
the two publications offer.

The Davidson Miscellany be-
gan in 1965 as a publication
designed to give students the
opportunity to read and critique
literary material from all over
the country. By advertising in
the Boston literary magazine
The Writer, it consistently at-
tracts many poetry and prose
submissions from the U.S.,
Canada, and the Caribbean
that, according to Faculty Ad-
viser Julius. Winkler, ‘‘We can
publish only between five and
ten percent of what is submitted
tous.”

Hobart’s Park began three

_years ago as an outgrowth of

“Inside Art,’’ a literary sup-
plement to the Davidsonian.
Unlike the Miscellany, it is
purely a student-run magazine.

- ‘Miscellany gets material
from all over the country. We
want to contrast that by pub-
lishing material from the David-
son community only,’’ Hobart’s
Park Editor Eddie Harrison

(Continued from page 1)
the school would be liable if a
civil suit were to result from the
shooting.

Shackleford’s grandfather,
Charles Coyle, said that Shack-
leford pulled the gun to try and
scare the people off so that he
could get away, and that the
gun went off “accidentally when
he was jumped from behind.”
According to Coyle, Shackle-
ford ‘“‘couldn’t believe it when
he saw the blood...he never
intended to shoot anybody.”’

‘Robbie was never in trouble
with the law in his life...not
even a traffic ticket,’’ Coyle
added.

Leman said, “I could under-
stand if it had been a ball bat,
but not a gun. There’s no other
reason for that but to kill.”

Students. expressed concern
about Shackleford’s quick re-
lease. Leman noted that there
was a story about a burglar who
was being held on $20,000 bond
on the same page of the
Charlotte Observer that carried
the story about the shooting,

explained.

Winkler said that the public-
ations are intended to be comp-
lementary. Hobart’s Park pro-
vides an outlet for student
writers. The Miscellany exposes
students to contemporary crea-
tive literature, proving ‘‘that
you don’t have to be dead 150
years to be worth reading.”

Neither magazine, however,
has had a smooth existence.

Objections to The Miscellany
have arisen out of the fact that
its current operating budget of
$4745 comes from Activities
Tax Council funds. The Council
appropriates the money David-
son collects in student activity

Hobart's Park received $2700
from the Activities Tax Council
last year.

Since the money for both
magazines comes from students
fees, some students think The
Miscellany should be devoted
exclusively to student poetry
and prose.

Miscellany editor Dave Rob-
erts disagreed. ‘‘We want to
expose more students to differ-
ent kinds of literature,’”’ Roberts
maintained. He also emphasiz-
ed that although there is a
faculty advisor, The Miscellany
is a student-run organization.
Students read and critique the
submissions.

Winkler added that not only
does The Miscellany ‘‘give stud-
ents experience in editing,” it
does publish about ten David-
son submissions a year, a little
over half the total submissions

and that ‘‘this guy(Shackleford)
was released without seeing a
judge.”’ Attar said, ‘‘His ac-
complices were home in bed
while we were still at the police
station making statements.”’

College President Samuel
Spencer said, ‘‘I’m very relieved
that Leman came off as well as
he did and was not killed.’’

Emergency Medical Techni-
cians Don Matthews and Skip
Brown, both Davidson stud-
ents, were on the scene and
bandaged Leman’s wound and
treated him for shock. Spencer
praised Matthews and Brown
for their handling of the situa-
tion. .

Hattie’s Night is held at
F&M on the first Thursday of
spring term. The party com-
memorates the night of April
27, 1975, when Hattie’s, David-
son’s most popular bar, burned
down.

-Leman said, ‘‘My friends, the
administration, and the athletic
department have all been very
helpful.”

received from the College com-
munity. The last issue featured
works of three professors, two
students, an alumnus, and a
town resident.

While The Miscellany has no
trouble finding submissions,
this is not the case for Hobart’s
Park. The Fall edition of Ho-
bart’s Park was delayed by lack
of student input.

“There was very little stud-
ent participation,’’ Manager
and Art Editor Sandra Davis
said. ‘‘We had to drag material
out of people. I was very
disappointed that no one want-
ed to make any contributions.
By the time we had enough
material to get started, exams
were here. We had to put it off
until after break.”

Hobart’s Park is now collect-
ing fiction/essays, photos,
drawings and poetry for the
- Spring edition. ‘‘We want stuff

that is not predictable,”’ Harri-
son said, ‘“‘but anyone who is
doing anything creative is wel-
come to submit material.”” The
staff plans to publish on sched-
ule this spring.

The Miscellany, however, is
already at the printer. Professor
Winkler noted that the staff
received ‘‘more submissions
this fall than in a long time.”

Even if both publications are
run smoothly, their relation to
the student body appears as
tenuous as ever. Still vying for
positive student response, both
Hobart’s Park and The Miscel-
lany are a long way from
improving their relatively ob-
scure existence at Davidson.
