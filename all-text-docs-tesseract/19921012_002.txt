Revolutionary New
Software Program Could
End Hassles of Drop-Add

By Rachel Newcomb

Last week, Davidson College
purchased an innovative new soft-
ware system which, over the next
few years, should dramatically in-
crease the efficiency of many of
the college’s operations. This
$400,000 system, called “Banner,”
was developed by SCT Corpora-
tion and will replace the current
AIMS administrative software that
Davidson uses.

The new Banner software will
have many uses, among them: bet-
ter identification of prospective
Davidson students, recording of
endowment gifts, and an easier way
for the financial aid office to deter-
mine whether students have sub-
mitted the required financial aid
forms.

Thecurrent software program,
AIMS, which has been in opera-
tion since 1981, has outlived its
usefulness. The company that pro-
duced AIMS went out of business,
andas aresult, Davidson computer

programmers have had to make
more than 2,000 time-consuming
modifications in order to keep it
updated.

“All the administration will
be onnew software; itis absolutely
currentand will be able to do things
we aren’t even aware of yet,” said
registrar Polly Griffin, whochaired
the administrative task force which
chose Banner.

“There are many possibilities,
and what is being done now on the
AIMS system will'be much more
efficient on Banner,” said Griffin.
She cited as an example the ease
with which Davidson students will
soon be able tocheck on necessary
credits and find out which require-
ments they still need to receive
diplomas.

According to Griffin, the new
software will allow Davidson the
opportunity to take:a look at some
of the current ways it operates and
let the college decide if changes
need to be made. The Drop/Add

From her unique perspective
atop the legal hierarchy, Fulton
first gave the audience insight into
the state legal system, touching
ground and exposing shortcom-
ings in such areas as the courts
themselves, the criminal justice
system, and the parole and proba-
tion systems.

The principal problem, ac-
cording to Fulton, is volume. Each
year the court system hears an in-
creasingly greater number of cases
and sentences greater number of
felons to periods of incarceration.

The prison system, like the justice
system, is’ at present unable to
handle this increase in volume.

. Consequently, mostconvicted
criminals serve only a fraction of
their prison sentences. In 1980,
the average prisoner served only
36% of the imposed prison sen-
tence. By 1990, this already alarm-
ingly low percentage had plum-
meted toa mere 22.5%, and Fulton
estimated that by the mid 1990’s
the percentage could fall to as low
as 2% of sentenced time unless
radical changes are made.

Furthermore, as these prison-
ers are released prematurely, they
are put into an already overbur-
dened parole system. This system
is unable to offer them positive
guidance, and therefore puts them
in jeopardy of becoming repeat
offenders.

process is one of the things that
could be affected. Many students
have complained about specific
difficulties, especially the lengthy
procedures involved in the actual
dropping and adding of classes.
Under the Banner software, a new
efficient method of Drop/Add
could be implemented that would
not have been possible on the ex-
isting system.

Banner has been hugely popu-
lar in large institutions and was
recently adjusted for campuses in
the 1,000-3,000 student range.

- Davidson is one of the first institu-

tions to try it out.

Installation of the first stage
of Banner, the financial program,
will be completed by July of 1993.
the other programs to be installed
in the future are human resources,
financialaid, and student & alumni
development. Banner should be
completely in place by the summer
of 1995.
