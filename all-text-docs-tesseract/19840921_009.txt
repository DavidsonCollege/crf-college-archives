The Right Stuff Tells NASA History With Wit

By MATT MORRIS

The Right Stuff smashes into Love
Auditorium on Friday, and Hallelujah!
This critically acclaimed, commercially
disasterous movie may finally get the at-
tention it deserves on the college campus
scene. Let’s hope so. A decidedly eccen-
tric, high-spirited history of the U.S.
space program, The Right Stuff contains
too much wit, insight and just plain old
pure cinema to be ignored, and deserves
the attention of every wide-eyed David-
son moviegoer.

In it’s precise retelling of the NASA
story, The Right Stuff may have turned
away 83 audiences because of its “‘his-
tory book” nature. What we watch on the
screen could make for a great indepen-
dent study, but more importantly, the
movie is truly enjoyable thanks to the
warm humanity injected into each char-
acter by wiz-kid director Phillip Kauf-
man.

Yes, there are space scenes, but the
film is more concerned with the domestic
terrors that can be incurred by a virtuous
young lad seeking “The Right Stuff.” It’s
a “people-movie,” centering on conflict-
ing relationships and less-than-monu-
mental everyday problems. Perhaps be-
cause of this, the film depends a great
deal on the performers’ ability to suspend
disbelief, and headed by playwright Sam
Shepard plus a cast of talented newcom-
ers, this is no problem.

At the onset of The Right Stuff, we are
given a clue as to where the film is head-
ing. Against a 20th century wild West
backdrop, filled with stallions, airplanes
and “men who are men,” Kaufman fo-
cuses on John Ford-style themes of vir-

tue, men and women in the 20th century,
and the U.S. itself and its values — good
and bad. The original right stuffer Chuck
Yeager (Shepard) trots into town on hor-
seback, rides over a ridge and discoveres
a sound-barrier-breaking airplane. There
is lies — Progress — and Yeager, ever
willing to hold his “toughest guy in
town” title gets off one horse and climbs
on the new iron one. He must prove his
stuff is right.

Of course Chuck Yeager does pos-
sess “the right stuff,” as he becomes the
first human to break the sound barrier.
From here the movie literally takes off,
following the careers of each new gener-
ation of modern cowboys — John Glenn,
Alan Shephard, Gordon Cooper and the
rest as they stand up to greater and great-
er challenges, reaching farther and
farther into space.

In spite of that rather patriotic synop-
sis, it may surprise you to find that one of
the nice things about The Right Stuff re-
mains its willingness to take chances.
Kaufman isn’t afraid to show the wrong
stuff — bureaucracy, imperfect as-
tronauts, and offensive newsmen clutter
the frame at every turn. Neither does he
run away from the obvious, not always
pleasant, personal troubles an astronaut
may face.

Interestingly, the wives of the space-
men are ultimately as affecting.as charac-
ters as the astronauts themselves, and at
times their ability to sacrifice appears
even more courageous than many of the
astronauts’ jaunts towards the outer
limits.

With his rugged good looks, Sam
Shepard makes an interesting Yeager;

moody and internal, he is a kind of James
Dean space jockey. Other performances
sparkle and convince — as John Glenn,
newcomer Ed Harris posseses a good-
guy spirit we always knew the original
had, and Scott Glenn gives us a hilari-
ously confused Alan Shepard wandering
around NASA training labs holding a
painful catheder, searching for a lost
machismo. Dennis Quaid gives the finest
performance of his highly varied career
as the “What? Me worry?” Gordon
Cooper, a child-man who, when he was a
toddler, probably wanted to be an as-
tronaut. Now, to the surprise of everyone
(including himself) becomes just that.

A highlight of all the performances in
The Right Stuff3-D ensemble would re-
quire an entire issue of Davidsonian type
space. At any rate, there’s nary an unin-
spired performance on the celluloid.

And of course Phillip Kaufman's di-
rection — he has constructed a cowboy
space-opera that perfectly captures, at
times even heightens, the sardonic, yet
flag-waving tone of Thomas Wolfe’s
best-seller. Heavily laden with visual
symbolism, fast-paced editing and some
of the most harrowing lift-off sequences

— Music

you've ever seen, Kaufmann always
keeps the viewer guessing. One moment
we watch a 1940’s mock-up newsreel,
the next a bit of Lynbdon Johnson
slapstick, and this is followed by a
majestic peek into outer space. The
movie has a quirky, just plain weird
structure, but never loses touch with the
characters and where they are, or are at-
tempting to be, in the universe.

There are problems. Sometimes the
symbolism is a bit overt. The film could
have done without “the man in the black
suit,” who visits recently widowed wives
of the astronauts, but so much of the vi-
sual language speaks so well, particu-
larly in the final hour, that one really
can't complain.

Perhaps The Right Stuffs nicest visu-
al touch, and one which immediately ties
the film together occurs each time a new
astronaut views outer space from his tin
can in the sky for the first time. Rather
than dazzling us with far-out space
scenes, the camera centers on an even
more jubilant special effect — the as-
tronaut’s face as he views with surprise,
suspicion, and above all, a wonder, the
final and largest frontier.

Let’s Active’s new L. P. Cypress
could well be the best album of 1984.
Here, for perhaps the first time, is a
collection that offers songwriting,
musicianship and production which
leaves nothing to be desired. Here is an
album that is wonderful for even the
casual listener to hear from beginning
to end.

The album starts with distant,
meandering guitar chords giving way
to a full-force attack of rhythm section,
vocals, accoustic and electric guitars
all on a single beat. With each beat,
producer/songwriter/lead vocalist/
keyboardist/guitarist (dare I say whiz
kid) Mitch Easter adds another sur-
prise.

The atmosphere is lush, but some-
how it maintains that garage band
sound with which the group has always
identified. In spite of all the well-re-
hearsed passages and perfect cues,
there is a spunk, a spontaneity which
few albums have. Just as “Ring True”
fades out and it is time to listen to side
two, the song returns momentarily for
one of the sloppiest musical refrains
since John Lennon complained of blis-
tered fingers sixteen years ago.

One thing peculiar about Cypress
that you will not find in the albums of
Let’s Active’s “Southern Revolution”
compatriots is the synthesizer. Rather
than run away from the technology or
be guilty of talentless overkill, Easter
uses the synthesizer sparingly and as a
background instrument.

The only synthesizer number,
“Gravel Truck,” is more of an instru-
mental introduction in the vein of
Eddie Van Halen's work.

The L. P. was a very long time in
the making. The band recorded all
summer long to achieve what most
bands do in a matter of weeks. The
problem was that Afoor, last year’s EP,
though critically acclaimed, was not so
warmly embraced. The band here

Let’s Active Expands
Talent On Cypress

WL (s qpety so S\cer gp {EAWs (!

worked extra hard to win the public
over this time. Fortunately, the extra
effort was worth it.

Let’s Active has the unusual gift of
being fronted by one of the most im-
portant producers in pop music today
(Easter and later co-producer Don
Dixon are responsible for the sound of
all R. E. M. on vinyl! today). This is
important because not only does each
track's sound differ musically, but the
production is different as well. Faye
Hunter's bass on “Waters Part” sounds
completely different from her bass on
“Prey;” while Sara Romweber's snare
is loud on “Easy Does,” it is a tam-
bourine that holds the percussive
weight on “Flags for Everything.”
Such attention to detail is rare indeed.

Speaking of bass and drums, Eas-
ter has mixed his two cohorts higher on
this disc than the last, giving it a more
“eighties” sound that will hopefully
tum more ears in their direction.

There is not a track on here that is
not excellent. From the harmonica on
“Prey” to the exciting commercialism
of “Blue Line,” Easter has included
hooks aplenty. :

If Cypress does not make Let's Ac-
tive, they may as well hang it up, be-
cause they will be hard pressed to
make an album as musically satisfying
as this.
