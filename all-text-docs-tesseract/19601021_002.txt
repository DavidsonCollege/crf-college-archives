The Campus: Monument To Hobart

For thirty-six years, Mr. Don Ho-
bart served Davidson as the college
supervisor of buildings and grounds,
in a labor of love which made David-
son's campus a showplace the year
‘round,

When he came to the campus in
1925, Davidson was a place of muddy
roads, sparse and unkempt grass and
few flowers.

Mr. Hobart changed that.

He created the dogwood grove be-
hind the Martin Science Building,
and shrubbery all across the campus;
he made a garden out of Davidson’s
eighty acres.

Students remember seeing the gen-
tle smiling man tending his flowers
behind Belk Dormitory, cutting the

best blooms to place in vases at the
College Union.

They remember his weary resigna-
tion upon seeing the new paths stu-
dents made across freshly planted
grass, his amusement when even
bramblebushes didn’t stop the path-
makers.

They remember a man dedicated to
his work—and happy in it.

There is an old Latin inscription
which translates, “If you seek his
monument, look about you.” No more
fitting epitaph could be found for Mr.
Hobart.

The entire campus family is sad-
dened by his sudden death.

Where Do We Stand?

For weeks now, the IFC and the
fraternities have played hot potato
with proposals and revised proposals
and revisions of revised proposals.
For three weeks in a row, this news-
paper has headlined some new effort
to do something about Sophomore
Rush.

We think it’s high time someone
did something about Sophomore Rush.
We like to know how things stand.

After failing three times in a row
to come up with a ‘solid alternative
to the Sophomore Rush plan, the fra-
ternity system has placed its hopes
in the hands of the freshman pledge
class presidents. This is the IFC’s last
chance— they know that some sort
of proposal must be presented to the
faculty at its next regular meeting—
and. that’s November 8.

Meanwhile, there has been no con-
firmation from the Hill that Sopho-
more Rush really is going to be put
into, effect. Why should we expect
confirmation?

—lIf for no other reason than the
fact that the fraternities, though dis-
united and self-centered, have very
obviously declared war on the defer-
red rush system.

—Because five members of the
faculty’s liberal wing, who helped put
Sophomore Rush through, are no

longer with us. Furthermore, a solid
old guard clique on the faculty is op-
posed to Sophomore Rush and might
possibly swing another vote on the
issue in the opposite direction.

—Because President Martin has
never given his official, unqualified
approval of the new system. Many
Students have inferred from his state-
ments on several occasions that he is
not an enthusiastic supporter of Soph-
omore Rush.

—The administration has not en-

couraged the fraternity system to
make any preparations for the defer-

red system, although it must realize
that without help from the fraterni-
ties, Sophomore Rush will be a dis-
mal flop. Nor has the administration
announced any concrete preparations
for making changes in the college
plant that must be made if the new
system is to succeed.

We suggest that the fraternity sys-
tem make some concessions and come
up with a system that will approach
the goals that Sophomore Rush was
set up to' achieve. The fraternities
have already discarded. two possibili-
ties.

We suggest that the faculty accept
a compromise or re-affirm their initial
decision. We'd like to know where we
stand. We're weary of piddling
around.

Nostalgia: Broads In The Balcony

Remember the good old days when
we had Friday Chapel and everybody
got the dance weekend off to a prop-
erly rowdy start?

Remember when Dr. Davidson let
the chickens loose, and still further
back, when the legendary Slim Regen
created such a stir just trying to find
his seat that the speaker had to ask
his permission to continue?

Remember how we used to impress
the girls in the balcony with our un-
gentlemanly conduct during those
Friday-of-dance-weekend chapels?

The Real Heroes

The real heroes of this weekend
have likely been forgotten.

Homecoming was started a long
time ago not because of the dances,
or the after-dance parties or even be-
cause of the girls, but because of a
football game.

Now, it seems that the game has
become an afterthought. There are a
few people who won't even bother to
come back from Hattie’s to see it.

Some 35 boys are willing to sacri-
fice a good bit to play the game that

But the Friday-of-dance-weekend
chapels have gone the way of the
freshman riot. Guess it’s a good thing,
too. Everybody used to gripe about
having to come to chapel on the day
the weekend started. But you know,
everybody came, and brought his
date if she was here, and there were
fewer cuts turned in that day than.
any other day in the semester.

Don’t you suppose it might be pos-
sible to change the Monday student
assembly to Friday on dance week-
ends?

Homecoming is built around. They’re
willing to give as good as they've got
against teams that out-man and out-
gun them. And yet a few people insist
on making crude jokes about moral
victories and losing so many games
in a row.

School spirit is no abstract, nebu-
lous thing. You measure it simply by
how loud people can yell. We don’t
think we've given up on the ’Cats. We
know the ’Cats haven’t given up on
themselves.

They’re the real heroes.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR .

Politicking Evokes

Student Praise, Condemnation

Godwin, Murdoch

Dear Editor:

After reading the article writ-
ten by Dr. Patterson in last
week’s DAVIDSONIAN, we, the
left-wingers, are inclined to

self-| agree with him that neither of
righteous, yet typical modern|the

presidential candidates

J.B. And the setting instead| shows the necessary leadership
of being the God-centered uni-|that the office requires.

verse of the Semitic world is
quite baldly naturalistic. Job’s
orthodox comforters are resty)-
ed as the threadbare comfort-
ers of our age: a rabid mech-
anistic-historian, a shabby psy-
chiatrist and a gloomy theolo-
gian.

But whereas the burden of
Job is communicated in the dia-
logues between Job and his
friends, in the play the most
significant dialogue is between
two down-and-out circus rousta-
bouts and between Job and his
genuinely believable wife Sa-
tah.

ENDING CRITICIZED

The most frequently criticized
part of “J.B." is the ending.
Although the album version
ending is longer and stronger
than in the published play,
“3.B." is still merely silenced
and not enlightened by God
concerning his suffering. The
impression is conveyed that J.
B. forgives God. The off-stage
voice of God, beautiful and ma-
jestic in the Hebrew poem,

We are further convinced
that Dr. Petterson is the only
men sufficient to lead this
people's republic to the cul-
mination of the Americen
ideals that were helf-heart-
edly begun under Franklin
D. Roosevelt.

Dr. Patterson says that nei-
ther candidate's religion is deep
enough to have any influence
on his behavior. We agree and
assert that the less religion a
candidate has, the better.

Realizing the lack of able
leaders in this country, we feel
that as vice-president, Fidel
Castro, who is not a norientity,
would not only add strength to

the ticket, but would help get

this country ‘out of its economic

turmoil as he has done in Cuba.
Our foreign policy is weak.

President Eisenhower's con-
duct should be more like that
exhibited by Premier Khrush-
chev last week at the United
Nations where he delivered a

series of diplomatic deferts
from which we will never re-
cover in the eyes of the
world,

We must reduce our arms
whether Russia does or not to
show the other countries of the
world our good intentions. Af-
ter this brilliant victory, we
could delight the world by
abolishing war, thereby restor-
ing the prestige we once en-
joyed.

We must not use anti-com-
munism as our foreign policy
so that the new nations of the
world will be won over to us
by our great moral fiber alone.
We agree that we must not sup-
port American private enter-
prise overseas because the
capitalist pigs do not give to

f

each according to his need.

We also know that we must
admit Red China to the United
Nations and tell the reactionary
Chinese on Formosa that they
must get out because “A New
Day Is Dawning.”

We enlightened ones feel
that the fermer in America
must submit himself to eb-
solute government control in
order to do his part for the
state. We believe thet Dr. .
Patterson will not only pre-
vent depressions, but reces-
sions as well. Of course, we
realize thet it will be neces-
sary that he be given untim-
ited funds to accomplish this.
After all, compatriots, with

Patterson and Castro, we have
nothing to feah but feah itself,

Dear Editor:

Men like Ernest Patterson de-
serve a congressional award

for courage (I’m sure such an
award would be rejected on
principle) when they are will-
ing to express intelligent poli-
tical and economic views in this
area of McCarthyism-run-riot
and blind cult-of-loyalty “Amer-
icanism.”

' hope Dr. Patterson wil?
not have to pay the tradi-
tional price for expressing in-
telligent views in public
(Woodrow Wilson called this
price “the darts and arrows
of ‘public obloquy”).

T also hope he will not have
to endure amusing statements
from his intellectual inferiors,
budding young Robber Barons
with early signs of satisfied pot
bellies, for one. can predict
down to the letter what tripe
might come from that breed of
unimaginative reactionary . . .
“why don't you offer your ser-
vices to Russia, Dr. Patterson?"
or... “why don’t you run for
president, Dr. Patterson,”
