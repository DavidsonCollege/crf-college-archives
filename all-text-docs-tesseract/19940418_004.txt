Homosexuality at Davidson: accounts from our community

By Ashlyn Dannelly
Until recent years, homo-
sexual members of the Davidson
College community have been ex-

vealing their sexuality. While ho-
mosexuality is not currently ac-
cepted by everyone across the
board, there appears to be a rising
sensitivity to the issue within
Davidson.

A faculty perspective

One homosexual faculty
member says that, “neither the ad-
ministration nor the faculty is in-
terested in my personal

other small, elite, private, liberal
arts colleges when it allows its
students to suffer.”

The teacher says, “The mate-
rial I teach is important, not any-
thing about my life. At any rate, I

. wouldn’t—and couldn’t—be a

spokesperson for all homosexuals.
That would be presumptuous. .. . I
really believe in students talking to
students and students educating
students about sexuality issues.”
An alumni perspective
One alumna, who graduated

. inthe mid-80’s, says that Davidson

at that time “was not a good place
to be if you were gay.” Six or
seven people in my class who came

hasn’t changed anything at all.”
The student perspective
Junior Hal Dougherty and se-
nior David Nutant came out pub-
licly at Davidson’s Sexuality Fo-
rum in March. According to
Dougherty, he did it “to promote
understanding and acceptance.” He
also hoped to “pave the road for
others to come out.” Nutant says,

“For me, [the forum] emphasized —

that I might be on this conservative
campus, but there is no reason I
should hide this fact.”

Nutant’s and Dougherty’s
openness differs greatly from the
attitudes they had when they first
arrived at Davidson. Dougherty
transferred to Davidson as

life. Davidson is a very
private place. However,
I don’t mean that any-
thing goes.” The teacher
adds, “The highest em-
phasis here is placed on
the quality of one’s teach-
ing and research.”

Anything dealing with
sexuality was criticized on
At Davidson,
gay culture goes over as

well as big hair.

Hal Dougherty

a sophomore, then took
two years off before re-
turning this year as a jun-
ior. Upon his initial ar-
rival, he says, “I basically
said that I wasn’t going to
deal with my homosexu-
ality when I came to
Davidson. I wanted to fit

finds it interesting when

sexuality issues come up in the ©

classroom, saying, “Those students
who know someone who is gay
have a deeper grasp of how com-
plicated sexuality is. I also have
students who say they don’t know
anyone who is gay or lesbian. I tell
them that they just don’t know that
they know those people.”

Speaking about being "out of
the closet," the faculty member
says, “I don’t feel that I must try to
hide my sexuality; atthe same time,
I don’t mention it to people in
passing. It doesn’t come up in
every conversation.”

In terms of being the subject
of gossip, the teacher says, “I’m
not aware of having been the sub-
ject of discussion by other faculty
members or administration .:. .
People seem non-discriminatory,
open-minded, fair, and compas-
sionate.”

Referring to student attitudes
toward homosexuals, the teacher
says, “It concerns me that other
schools with whom Davidson likes
to compare itself have made more
progress on this issue... here there

is debate and uncertainty .. . I:

would like tosee that students could
be ‘out’ here without fear of harm,
discrimination, and ostracism ..

out after graduating . . . that is
probably only one-third of the ac-
tual number of out alums.”

She says that there are “tricky
politics” to coming out of the closet.
As a professional, she says, “I sus-
pect that job security is a large
concern for Davidson alums. ..so
many of us have high profile jobs

. .itcan make you vulnerable on
a professional level.”

She did not realize she was a
lesbian until shortly after gradua-
tion. She made a point to return to
Davidson and tell some of her
former teachers they "have been
tremendously supportive.”

She speculates that she and
the other gay members of her class
“may have just poured a lot of

‘energy, into doing other things. At

Davidson, lots of people spend
more time on academics than in-
ter-personal issues.” :

She had an almost entirely
positive reaction from her friends
to her coming out of the closet. “In
countering prejudice, it is impor-
tant that you know people well...
of all my close friends from
Davidson, only one has rejected
me.” :

She gives “so much credit to

.. Davidson for the close ties formed

with professors. My coming out

in... I didn’t feel like Ihad
any outlet.to pursue dealing with
my sexuality.”

_Nutant says, “It wasn’t until
sophomore year that I realized how
hard it would be to deal with that
here. Anything dealing with sexu-
ality was criticized on this campus

.. it’s a very homogeneous cam-
pus.” Dougherty adds, “On this
campus, gay culture goes over as
well as big at But Charlotte is
progressing.”

During his sophomore year,
Nutant became more open about
his homosexuality because he “had
a fairly openly gay friend... it was

’ sort of realizing something that

was always there and owning up to
it. It wasn’t going away, and I
shouldn’t repress it.” Nutant
opened up even more after spend-
ing his junior year in France. He
says, "[friends there] knew from
the start I was gay. After living a
year like that, where it wasn’t even
an issue, I came back and said,
‘This is who I am, accept it.”
Similarly, after two years away
from Davidson, Dougherty had
“good friends with whom I felt
comfortable. They helped me feel
safe. WhenI came back, I had faith
in the school and in the people.
Somehow, I found a niche.” He
adds, “My homosexuality is not a

choice.”

Regarding the faculty’s treat-
ment of homosexuality as an issue,
Dougherty says, “There has been a
lack of interest. [The faculty] have
all these interests in campus life,
yet they don’t really deal with ho-
mosexuality.” Nutantsays, “When
there was all this debating about
FLAG, (in the fall of 1991) [the
faculty] kept a low profile . . . it
should be part of the education
process. People should be more
aware of it.”

In the classroom, Dougherty
encountered situations where the

teacher assumed, when asking a

question, that he would date a
“novia,” which in Spanish means a
girlfriend. “They assume you are
going to say the opposite sex.” He
says, “Even an innocent mistake in
gender translation elicits juvenile

giggling.”

Nutant encountered one pub-
lic display of homophobia at a
Patterson Court party, where some-
one screamed, “freak” and “fag.”
Nutant attributes the incident to
his different method of dressing.
“They were harping on him be-
cause he was different,” Dougherty
says. “Funderstand the fear of the
unknown, but I don’t understand
the hatred.” .

Referring to Davidson’s
progress with the homosexuality
issue, Dougherty says, “This place
has progressed. Dave and I are
very optimistic. We’re not angry
at the campus. We’re understand-
ing.” Nutant adds, “It would be
interesting to be a freshman and be
part of the change that will hap-
pen.” He encourages students to
“not deal with homosexuality as
this abstract thing because we're
everywhere [snap. snap.]”
