Despite improvement, scheduling problems exist

By Jennifer Kerns

Few expect to need drop/add
for the last semester senior year.
However, despite permission or
good numbers, some ‘seniors re-
ceived only one or two classes.

Anna Watkins has one class:
19th century Russian literature in
translation. ‘“‘According to the
Registrar, this is my only class. I
don’t know how I could have got-
ten this, unless the computer ran-
domly selected something for me.
I'ma senior French major, my first
number was 5, and I still didn’t get

my advanced French poetry class.
There were five of us signed up,
and only one person got the class.
They said that the computer must
have misread aprerequisite require-
ment. Now I will have to go to
drop/add to pick up the course, as
well as an independent study. ”
Sinda Speer, another French
major, only has one course. “I
signed up for two upper level
French courses and Spanish 102.
How could I get my third choice,
and not my first and second
choices? I know there are spaces

left, so I guess there was some
mix-up.”

Jim Moss had a similar prob-
lem in his major. “I don’t know
what is going on. If my number is
17, and I didn’t get my 300-level
music class, then there’s some-
thing wrong. Maybe there’sa glitch
in the computer system.”

Linn Dukes received a 300-
level course in anthropology in-
stead of her 300-level history class.
“I know that the class is popular,
but history is my major, not an-
thropology. I need to pick up an-

other history course at drop/add.
Still, I have gotten more classes
this semester than before.”

Since most courses for seniors
fulfill major requirements and/or
graduation requirements, there
must be some schedule adjustment.
Seniors have top priority on these
major courses, such as seminars
and 300-level courses, As one
student says, ““We must have cer-
tain courses to graduate. I don’t
have an English seminar, but I’m
not worried.”

Registrar Polly Griffin ex-

plains that these problems may be
attributed to the fact that the office
is using a new computer system
with new software. However, she
says that about 1,400 out of 1,600
students recieved three or four
classes, which is a much greater
percentage than in past semesters.

“Tf students have questions
please come by and we’ll look at
their forms,” says Griffin.

As fourth-year students, we
realize that things will work out
eventually. “I usually end up with
the classes I wanted,” says Moss.

Religion departmient chair believes Christian requirement for profesors should be dropped

The resolution passed with 26
yes votes, 2 no votes, and one
abstention. The issue has yet to be
decided by the*Trustees.

Davidson graduate Jim Fuller,
a former Vice President of the
Alumni Association, feels strongly
that the policy requiring trustees to
be Christian is exclusive and po-
tentially eliminates many dedi-
cated alumni as candidates for the
Board of Trustees. ©

“Anyone who attends
Davidson knows thatitis a strongly
church-related school,” says Fuller.
“After maintaining a good tenure
as a student and becoming an
alumni, it seems neither fair nor
the best reflection of the college
that when it comes time to select
trustees that Davidson would slam
its doors and treat those who were
not active members of a Christian
church with indifference. Certainly
the goal is not to separate from the
church, but once someone joins
the Davidson family, they should
be able to remain at that table for
the rest of their lives.”

Only Christian

_ quirement,”

Religion Professors?

At the November 1,
meeting, SGA President Eric
Rosenbach addressed the require-
ment that religion professors be
Christian. Rosenbach feels the re-
quirement limits students’ oppor-
tunities to learn from non-Chris-
tian professors.

The discussion concerning the
religion department lasted only
three weeks in the SGA. The reso-
lution, authored by Connor sena-
tor Jo Burrows, passed with only
one opposition noted.

“T saw areal problem with not
letting professors of other religions
teach here at Davidson, all because
of an outdated and ridiculous re-
says Burrows.

Rosenbach maintains that the
resolution was important because
the requirement contradicted a pas-
sage in the college’s Statement of
Purpose:

The loyalty of the college thus
extends beyond the Christian com-
munity to the whole human com-

-munity and necessarily includes

and openness to and respect for
the world’s various religious tra-
ditions. Davidson is dedicated to

1994 .

the quest for truth and encourages
teachers and students to explore
the whole of reality, whether physi-
cal or spiritual, with an unlimited
enployment of their intellectual
powers. Faith and reason must
work together in mutual respect if
Davidson is to realize and main-
tain its particular vision of aca-

- demic excellence.

Dr. David Kaylor, Chairman
of the Department of Religion,
comments that the requirement for
religion professors to be Christian
has “never come up as an issue in
the religion department, so there
has not been an occasion to push
for a change.”

Kaylor notes that three de-
partments were once included in
the original bylaw, - religion, phi-
losophy, and psychology. Accord-
ing to Kaylor, the psychology de-
partment was released from the
bylaw after pointing out that its
subject matter was not related to
faith.

The requirement ‘for the phi-
losophy department was removed
when the department wanted to
hire someone opposed to this re-
quirement.

litical science major, has written
a paper on “The Perceived Effec-
tiveness of the SGA.” To gather
necessary information, Carithers
designed a survey that was com-
pleted by 408 students. Based on
the hypothesis that the Davidson
student body does not perceive
the SGA to be effective at gov-

Survey tells all about effectiveness of SGA

erning and shaping student life,

Sean Carithers, a senior po-~ Carithers discovered that while

most students perceive the SGA to
be effective, the majority of stu-
dents appeared to be frustrated with
communication, between the stu-
dent body and the SGA.

Also, there is a pervasive lack
of knowledge about the SGA and
the issues that it is dealing with.
After evaluating the surveys,

Carithers determined that 57.1%
of the respondents are interested
in politics while only 17.9% re-
sponded that they were not. Also,
70.6% of respondents votes in
SGA elections while only 29.4%
does not.

Carithers concludes that the
means of communication be-
tween the students and the SGA
must be mnproved.

“In a real sense, this require-
ment is an expression from an ear-
lier time,” says Kaylor. “In the
process of redefinition, sometimes
an institution outgrows its docu-
ments.”

Kaylor comments that he
would like to see the requirement
removed: “As the religion depart-
ment has diversified and continues
to do so, this requirement could
potentially be more of aproblem. I
would like to see the requirement
dropped before it hampers recruit-
ment.”

Kaylor alsoremarks that there
seems to be an incorrect assump-

. tion that the purpose of the religion

department is to propagate faith.
“Our purpose is not to propagate
the faith, but to teach critically and
sympathetically and search for car-
ing and competent professors with
character,” says Kaylor. “Religious
affiliaton is just not a major ingre-
dient.”
Presidential Qualifications

The debate concerning reli-
gion department requirements has
proven far less controversial than
the issue concerning the religious
affiliation of the president. At an
October 25, 1994 SGA meeting,
Rosenbach questioned a section of

the college constitution requiring
the president of the college be a
“loyal and active churchman, giv-
ing evidence by his life of the
strength of his Christian faith and
commitment.”

The constitution asserts that
the president’s faith would be “‘ap-
propriately expressed” by an af-
filiation with the Presbyterian
Church and an active participation
in the college church.

Junior Darrell Smith, a mem-
ber of the Ecumenical Council says,
“The religion department issue is
one of academic excellence rather
than a matter of religious life.”

Sophomore Matt Rich, Co-
chair of the Chapel Committee,
agrees, “The  president’s
Presbytarianism is a tangible ele-
mentin shaping the identity of the
college. It is important that the
president, as leader, embody the

\traditions we profess to uphold.”

Others disagree. Phi Delt sena-
tor Rick Onkey feels the require-
mentis “inherently discriminatory. —
Unfortunatly many of Davidon’s
traditions are discriminatory. Tra-
dition is fine to an extent, but
Davidson would not be where it is

possibility of a survey, panel dis-
cussion and/or speaker, and fac-
ulty/student round tables to dis-
cuss the issue. Says Buford: “For
the future of the committee, I fore-
see formal interviews conducted
with faculty and students to gain a
direct view of what is needed. Also,
we have even discussed the pros-
pect of having an entire Honor
Week at Davidson to really em-
phasize the importance of the
Honor Code.”

Honor Council Chairman
Arthur Gaston maintains that the
problem is that there is just confu-
sion about the entire Honor Sys-
tem. “The common theme is that
people are just confused about the

system, including the Code of Re-
sponsibility and.the Honor Code.
Freshmen seem to be really scared
that they will make a mistake, but
what we really want to emphasize
is that the Honor Code and the
entire system is really amazing.”
Buford concurs: “Most students
don’t even consider what a privi-
lege it is to know that you are
entirely trusted upon your on will.”

Honor Council Secretary
Anna Gray Anderson stresses that
at this point, there are really more
“questions and discussions about
the Honor Code than problems.”
Buford agrees: “If the committee
can effectively define the gray ar-
eas, our job of coming up with
solutions for the future will be much
easier.”
