In a statement regarding

Monson Gives Honor Court

Position On Thefts

The Student Senate voted to
back the Student Hearing
Committee's campaign to
lessen library book thefts in
this week's meeting.

The Chairman of the
Student Hearing Committee,
Mark Monson, appeared at the
meeting in response to the
Senate’s proposal for a tur-
nstile system in the new
library.

Monson expressed a con-
cern that this action was adop-
ted before other measures
have been tried to stop the
problem of missing library
books.

He read a resolution from
the Student Hearing Com-
mittee which proposed the
following action for the winter
term:

1) establishment of a tem-
porary check-desk for all
books leaving the library;

2) a publicity campaign
directed towards all users of
the library in order to
generate an increased con-
cern and consciousness of the
problem. This campaign will
potentially include such items
as posters, book-drop stations,
and talks by Hearing Com-
mittee members to eating
clubs, freshman halls, and
faculty members; and

3) request assistance of the
SGA, Library Committee,
Student Conduct Council,

on their own schedule is a
breaking of a _ gentlemen’s
agreement and an act of bad
faith toward all other social
groups on and off campus,” he
continued.

Baker explained that Sig Ep
“didn’t consider changing its
decision until Oct. 31. We
didn’t make any objections
prior to that.

‘We had been giving it our
full support and did par-
ticipate with the first formal
rush.”’

Jim Coggin, Sig Ep rush
chairman, supported the
move declaring that “Sig Ep
is distinctly separate from the
on-campus eating groups. We
feel that our decision to rush,
bid, and pledge freshmen the
first week of winter term will
not adversely affect the self-
selection procedure and will
provide a positive contribution
to the social life at Davidson.”

...- Obstruction

(Continued from page 1)

It is presently uncertain
what student members of the
committee John Hornickel,
Blain Butner, and Bo Phillips
want as they have never made
their position clear.

Former student members of
the committee and others in-
timately involved, on the other
hand, have pushed for student
representation with full voting
rights in the faculty meeting.

It became quite clear after
the first year of committee
deliberations (1971-72) that
the faculty would never go a-
long with students voting inany
kind of faculty meeting. So the
students compromised their
position to the point where
they demanded only to attend
and participate in any and all
debate, but not to vote.

For their part however, the
faculty seems unwilling to
compromise at all in this mat-
ter. Since they are arguing
from a position of strength they
are as unyielding as granite.
(Their position is a result of
two factors: 1)students have
little bargaining power, and 2)
Spencer has assured the
faculty that nothing will go to
the trustees without their ap-

It seems that what the
faculty is really afraid of is
students just listening to
faculty discussion and debate
at their meetings, or witness-
ing the real power struggles
unfold.

As it now stands, faculty
members may hold any
position they wish and ignore
student opinion since only the
SGA president will be there to
hold them to what they say.
Unfortunately one student
against 90 faculty members is
not very good odds.

If students were present ina
significant number, then the
faculty might be forced to con-
sider what they say more
carefully, a possibility which
many want to avoid at all
costs.

This is where all the con-
troversy presently lies. On
Nov. 28 a third governance
model, drawn up by trustee
member Mullis, professor
MacCormac, and _ student
Phillips will be presented to
the full committee.

It is hoped that this model
will provide an alternative to
the educational policy dilem-
ma. It is doubtful however,
that it will incorporate any
significant student input at the
