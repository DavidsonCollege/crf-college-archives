and Ed Cunningham made the “Y” serv-
ice last Sunday one of the most inter-
esting of the year, The general theme
of the four speeches was the Message
of the Volunteer Convention, which was
recently held at N. C. C. W. The part
taken by the young ladies in the pro-
gram made the service fit in well with
the general plan of Junior Speaking.
The first speaker, Rolston Bitzer,
showed that the Volunteer movement is
the greatest existing force now striving
for the evangelization of the world. In
telling of the rapid growth of the Vol-
unteer Movement, which was organized

'33 years ago, he stated that cach national

hosts, who are arming themselves for
the spiritual conquest of the world in
this generation,

Miss Mabel Stamper, former vice-
president of North Carolina Volunteer
Union §poke on possessing a really jn-
timate, personal friendship with Christ.
The three necessary steps for attaining

this friendship with Him were by con- and Wate keen:

stant, earnest prayer, by an unshaken
belief, and by a true willingness to sur-
render everything for Christ.

strong Christian living, for a world view
of its needs, and for aggressive action
on our part. The world today is looking
for Christians. more than for Christian-

ity. The 19th century made the world a
Neighborhood. It is the duty of the

zoth century to make it-a Brotherhood.
We must think in terms of Humanity.
The last ‘speaker, Ed Cunningham,
gave a glimpse of the good times had at
the conference. In discussing just what
the greatest need of the world is today,
he stated that it is Christ and urged
that we truly make Him real to the
world.

The two laboratories for the Physics
department are extremely well equopped
with new and modern apparatus and are
well lighted and ventilated. The Junior
laboratory is provided with brick piers
to support the heavy apparatus and also
with 110- and 120-volt alternating and
direct current. The Sophomore labora-
tory is practically the same with the
exception that it is supplied with only a
110-volt current. Lockers for apparatus
have been placed in each laboratory.

Since the burning of the old Physics

students of Physics have been thrown
