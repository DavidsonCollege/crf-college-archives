Crime explosion

Coed escapes attempted

assault in union restroom 7 =

By BRAD SWALWELL
Staff Writer

Davidson has recently been
a witness to an increase in
crime, with one assault and
numerous robberies occuring
in the past two months.

Over homecoming weekend,
an unknown assailant
attempted to attack a young
woman in the restroom outside
the 900 Room on the second
floor of the College Union. The
woman was able to frighten
the attacker away, after
screaming and slamming the
door of the restroom on his
hand.

According to Union
Director C. Shaw Smith, the
woman reported the attack to
him shortly after it occured.

‘‘The girl came to me and
told me what had happened. I
suggested the police be called
immediately .

“But she did not want her
name to be involved. She
wanted to call her father
before calling the police. She
did, and her father agreed that
the police should be called.
But he also insisted that the
girl’s name not be mentioned.

“T called the police and they
came right over. They told us
that the girl’s name would be
kept confidential,’’ said
Smith.

Jack Hughes said that a
complete search of the area
was made for the suspect.
“We looked all around the
campus and the town. We
could not find anybody who
fitted the description. Let’s
face it-- we were called an hour
after the assault occured.
There is not much chance to
catch somebody after that
long a delay,’ said Hughes.
Hughes emphasized the
importance of calling the
police immediately if any

incident such as this occurs.

Smith reiterated that it was
at the woman’s explicit
request that the police were
not called immediately.

‘“We did not know if her
name would have been made
public if she reported the
incident to the police,’’ said
Smith. ‘‘Now that I know no
names need be involved, I will
insist that the police be
notified immediately if there
are any similar occurrances in
the union in the future.”

Assault had not been the
only crime problem at David-
son recently, according to
cross-country coach Sterling
J. Martin, Jr.

“The cross-country locker
room under the football stands
has been robbed three dif-
ferent times while the team
was practicing. Once was the
day of the Freshman Cake

Race. Then we got hit about

two weeks ago and once again }

just last Thursday,
Martin.

According to Martin, the
first theft was the most costly
to the team members. ‘‘We
lost around $300. counting the
watch that was stolen and the
money in the wallets which
were stolen,’’ he said.

Since that time, the team
has had a locked box to store
valuables in during practice.
“The two wallets stolen in the
next two thefts were not
locked up in the box. The box
was installed right after the
first robbery,’’ said Martin.

Martin added that the =

regular locker room, where the
soccer team dresses, was also
robbed during the Freshman
Cake Race and the same day

WDAV to broadcast ABC radio news

By SCOTT REID
Staff Writer

WDAV may well be broad-
casting American Contempor:
ary News several times each
day by the beginning of the
winter term, according to
WDAYV Station Manager Jack
Golden.

The five minute newscasts,
prcduced by the ABC Radio
News Network, will carry
national and international
news which will supplement
the local news already pro-
‘duced by the WDAV News
Department.

“This is an experiment,
really ,’’ said Golden. “It is an
attempt to inform the David-
son student who is largely
isolated from national news
events.

‘‘We have looked into the
possibility of getting some

type of network news for the
station before now, but either
the costs or the technicalities
involved in broadcasting it
were prohibitive.

“Then, at the beginning of

Council to survey students

concerning term paper issue

By CATHY LANDIS
Staff Writer
The Student Conduct

Council (SCC) met Nov-
ember 5 with a member from
the Faculty Exectutive Com-
mittee concerning the issue of
whether or not faculty mem-
bers must state specifically
their policy on using one paper
for credit in two courses.

The committee sent the
issue back into subcommittee
for further consideration.
They plan to determine opi-
nions from the majority of the
student body before making a
final decision.

On October 22 the SCC sent
a report to the Faculty Exec-
utive Committee ‘‘to clarify
the problem of how to deal
with the submission of one
paper for credit to two or more
Davidson courses.”

The SCC feels that it is each
individual faculty member’s
responsibility to submit to the
students in writing at. the
beginning of the course his
policy for dealing with papers.

After this action, a student
who uses one paper for two
courses would be committing
an honor offense if he breached
the faculty member’s written

policy rather than committing
a possible academic offense
which would result in an
automatic F.

The faculty sent a request
back to the SCC to reconsider
its policy.

The Faculty Executive
Committee desires a general
policy stating that the sub-
mission of one paper for two
courses is not admissable
under any circumstance unless
special permission from the
teacher is received.

The SCC must now decide
whether to continue their ori-
ginal stand or further the
faculty’s request.

this school year, after we had
talked to several people at
other stations, we decided to
contact ABC News in New
York City about the possi-
bility of using Contemporary
News for free. They were
extremely helpful and gave us
permission almost immedi-
ately.”

The plan, at that time, was
to get the network news from
WRPL in Charlotte, the local
ABC affiliate. The WDAV
Business Manager Jeff Sich
discovered that it would cost
the station $103 per month to
rent the special phone line that
was to bring the news from
WRPL to WDAV.

“We thought we’d have to
drop the whole idea because
we couldn’t afford paying
Southern Bell that much
money,’’ said Sich. ‘‘But then
we found out from our station
engineer, Jeffrey L. Watts,
that there was another way to
get the news for virtually
nothing.”’

The way Sich referred to
involves monitoring the sub-
carrier signal of WGNC in
Gastonia. The sub-carrier sig-
nal cannot be picked-up by a
regular radio, only by a special
receiver.

“Watts told us that he could
either get such a receiver in
Charlotte for free from the
Muzak Corporation, or he
could repair one that he had in
his house and give it tous,”’
explained Sich.

All that remained at that
point was to get permission of
WGNC and ABC News.
WGNC normally rents its
rights for ABC News .to other
stations for $50 per month--
again much more than WDAV
could afford.

Golden decided that to con-
tact WGNC through a David-
son alumnus who was a
prominent businessman or
who had done business with
the station in Gastonia might
be the best way to get the
station to give WDAV the
news rights for free. :

“As I was walking through
Chambers to the Alumni Of-
fice,’’ recalled Sich. ‘‘I met
Will Terry and jokingly asked
him if he knew any prominent
Gastonia alumni. His imme-
diate reply was ‘Dan LaFarr,
aria

LaFarr was contacted on
October 27th. The following
day he called back to say that
he had gotten ‘‘a favorable
response” from WGNC Gen-
eral Manager Pat McSwain.

‘“‘T talked to McSwain the
next day,’’ continued Sich,
‘‘and once he was satisfied
that we were a non-commercial
educational station he gave his
approval pending written per-
-mission from ABC News. _

“We phoned ABC and again
they gave us permission.
We've sent a written request
to them and are now only
waiting for their formal writ
‘ten reply which we’ll present
to WGNC.”

WDAV will broadcast Con-
temporary News at the breaks
between each two hour show
except during classical music
programming when it will not
be used at all. Each five
minute newscast will be fol-
lowed by one or two minutes of
local news headlines except at
8 p.m. when the regular
full-length local newscast is
broadcast.

“I would prefer CBS or
NBC news, but in speaking to
