Communication Gap

Last week's so-called “Brown
Ground Report” made a telling point
when it referred to the lack of com-
munication between students on the
one hand and administration on the
other. ;

To most students, administration
figures appear as stereotypes, individ-
uals who can be characterized by a
glib phrase or nickname. There is lit-
tle awareness of the scope most admin-
istrative positions entail. .

The situation from the other point
of view is no better. Aside from con-
tact with certain student leaders and
with errant students seeking solutions
to specific problems, there is little ad-
ministration. student interplay of ideas
and feelings. Consequently, those who
run the day-to-day affairs of the col-
lege have little awareness of what stu-
dents are thinking or wanting. ;

Even the Student-Faculty Coordi-
nating Committee, which was estab-
lished for the very purpose of main-
taining communication between stu-
dents and administration, has failed to
even give a semblance of operation
this year. The committee has met once
during the year, in October, and that
only to discuss perfunctory matters.
The committee has never worked ide-

ally, and at times it has even hindered
progress. It certainly does not operate
as a substitute for the much-needed
personal contact that is acutely lack-
ing here now. Rather, it serves as an
indication of the poor state to which
affairs have dropped. .

Several years ago, when a minor
crisis flared on campus over the col-
lege’s drinking rule, the president ap-
peared at an Open End program to
state and clarify ‘nuances in the ad-
ministration’s position. It was an ex-
cellent means of establishing a certain
degree of rapport and understanding,
even where.a lack of basic agreement
existed.

Davidson's trouble is that it is ba-
sically crisis-oriented. So long as the
boat cruises smoothly, no one dares
mention the possibility of rocking it.
It works fine for keeping the status
quo for long periods, but when a prob-
lem does dare to raise its head, it is
unnecessarily painful to face it, be-
cause of the lack of understanding on
both sides of the fence. The informal
Open End confrontations and hastily
called Student-Faculty Coordinating
Committee meetings should be replac-
ed by a continuing program of con-
sciously planned programs.

A Question Of Value

Tuesday night’s Open End on subsi-
dized athletics failed to live up to its
potential because the wrong people
were answering the questions. The key
issue in the whole controversy, as Ed
Dwelle pointed out, revolves around
the question of the college’s over-all
values, values which Lefty Driesell
and Homer Smith have no part in
formulating.

Davidson’s athletic program assum-
ed its present form when the trustees
and faculty decided that they “val-
ued” the benefits that subsidization
could bring the school. Coaches Drie-
sell and Smith didn’t decide that sub-
sidization was good for Davidson and
they aren’t the ones who should be

¢

called on to defend it. Driesell and
Smith are employees of the college,
who, as Driesell justly emphasized,
are merely “doing their job” of carry-
ing out an athletic policy formulated
by the faculty and trustees. No one
can fault them for that.

The people who should have been
answering the questions Tuesday night
are the faculty and trustees. They are
the ones who decide what Davidson
values; therefore they are the ones
who should be asked to show how the
presence of subsidized athletics at Da-
vidson is consistent with our goal of
becoming one of the finest small lib-
eral arts colleges in the country.

In The Right Direction

Nobody can say that Miles College,
at Birmingham, Ala., is getting a hand-
me-down in the person of its new di-
rector of freshman studies. That Ne-
gro students across the length and
breadth of the land—hbe they in ele-
mentary schools, high schools or col-
leges— have had to make do with
hand-me-downs is one of the egregi-
ous handicaps which have too long
lain in the path of the proper educa-
tion of black youth. John Monro, Dean
of Harvard College—in many ways at
the very peak of his distinguished
academic career — is striking as mo-
mentous and memorable an individual
blow at this pattern as any individual
could.

In accepting the Miles appointment,
he is following a path already traveled
by many idealistic young scholars, who
upon graduation with distinction from
Ivy League colleges, have chosen to
give a year or more of their time to
teaching in Negro colleges in the
South. But Dean Monro’s decision to
give up his prestigious job at Harvard
while still a relatively young man for

Who's On First?

You’ve probably seen the advertise-
ments recently by the second largest

proclaim that if they aren’t stopped,
they'll be number one by 1970.

their second largest car rental agen-
cv. Perhaps some of them may start

a total commitment to Miles is un-
precedented.

In all fairness to Southern Negro
colleges, nobody should overlook the
fact that—for all the odds against
which they struggle —they in turn
have their successes. The path be-
tween them and some of the best edu-
cational institutions in the North is
trod occasionally in the direction op-
posite to that which Dean Monro is

Such bridges between black and
white in the United States are all the
more important when both communi-
ties have temporarily withdrawn again
into their laagers of protective racial
solidarity. Admittedly, the hiatus is
largely due to frustration over how to
crack the nut of the problem in the
North, rather than in the South —

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Illusions, Reality Clash At Montpellier

Dear Editor:

There are two distinct as-
pects of the Davidson Junior
Year at Montpellier; the first
aspect is the image of France
and life at a European Uni-
versity formed by the student
before he leaves Davidson. His
mind is full of the stories he
has heard—many from faculty
members who have spent some
time in Europe—of the deep
political and social involve-
ment of French students; the
greatness and comprehensive-
ness of the French university
system. and the responsibility
with which these dedicated
French students handle a facet
of educational life which is

only beginning to be discussed
at. Davidson—academic free-
dom.

In addition to the picture of
the French educational sys-
tem. which the student usual-
ly comes to take for granted,
is that of the student’s own
life at Montpellier—a year of
trips to every part of the Con-
tinent, sleeping until ‘noon ev
ery day; and spending more
time in discotheques and cafes
with the world famous
“French girl than in class
with his notebook—all of which
he puts under the head of “’in-
dependent study.”

The second aspect of the
program is reality. It is cer

tainly true that the opportun-
ity for European travel is
great. The amount of travel a
student does while at Mont-
pellier depends on his initia-
tive and the size of his bank
account, and is one of the most
rewarding and exciting phas-
es of the program. For many,
myself included, it is a major
reason for coming to France.

As for the French girls, the
discotheques, and sleeping un-
til noon—that is directly pro-
portional to the student's abfl-
ity to handle girls at home
and his time spent at Hattie’s
and in the sack. Being an
American is not going to con-
vert a sophomore introvert in-

Antiquated Drug Laws

Persecut2 Gentle People’

By Collegiate Press Se: vice

They're busting the gentle
people again. It's no surprise.
really, Mankind has never
been very tolerant of its mis
fits. There was a time. in
Rome. when they tossed them
to lions before degenerate
thrill seekers because they re-
fused to offer incense to Jupi-
ter of Mithras.

But though human persecu-
tion has had many varied
forms through history, one as-
pect never changes—it’s the
gentle people who catch the
most hell.

Maybe it’s because they
can't fight back. Maybe it’s
because of an innate sadistic
streak in homo sapiens. May-
be it is the overpowering ter-
ror of the unknown. Or maybe
it's because they offer a quiet
and disturbing challenge to
our own inner convictions so
we must hide our doubts in
outrage and atrocity.

But always, .it's the gentle
people we bust. America has
progressed and we don't bust
them any more for religion
(well, not most religions any-
way) or for politics (well, not
most politics anyway). We
bust them for grass though.

Grass. Cannabis Satva. The
Evil Weed. Pot. Tea. Mary
Jane. Panama Red. Acapulco
Gold. In short-—marijuana. Ex-
actly why we bust them it's
hard to say. They haven't hurt
us. Their weed only makes
them gentler.

They only want to bang
around their own minds and
hunt for what they can find in
the dusty corners of sensory
experience. Since when is that
skin off of our nose?

So they grow their hair long.
Big Deal! No long-haired hip-
pie ever ordered workers mur-
dered for trying to organize
.a union—which is a lot more
than we can say for a lot of
eminently “respectable” busi-
ness executives that this coun-
try honots in memory when it
should spit on thelr graves.

We scream at the gentle peo-
ple that their marijuana rots
their minds. Then we go home

and take our daily pint of fuel
cil. eat the olive, snap at our.
wfe, vomit an the rug and
feel sclf righteous as all get
cut because we're not  pot-
heads.

These kids aren't stupid you
know.. They've read the La
Guardia report. the definitive
study on “The Marijuana
Problem in the City of New
York." It says bluntly that
mariiuana isn’t a problem and
should be legalized! Just about
all competent studies by sci-
entists. as opposed to opinion-
ated ‘‘moralists’’ yield the
same conclusion. Marijuana
should be legal in the United
States as it once was. It can
be regulated and eontrolled as
is liquor—a drug to which it is
often compared and to which
it is superior on every point.

But we never learn. We out-
law marijuana and drive the
gentle people underground, ali-
enate them from society and
force them into an alien sub-
culture which is infinitely more
incompatible with our dream
of a standardized homogen-
ized 2 per cent butterfat Amer-
ican Way of Life than they
would ever be if we left them
alone.

We wonder how many more
thousands of young and prom-
ising lives will be smashed in
the mincing machine of our
superstitions and antiquated
drug laws before the public
wakes up. But our hopes are
low. There can be no salvation
for the hippies, for they are
gentle folk.

If they'd riot and burn and
loot and kill and plunder and
let the streets run red with
blood we'd notice them. We'd
respect them. And we'd imme-
diately begin a dialogue. But
they're not. They're gentle peo-
ple asking only the freedom to
explore their own inner con-
sciousness and to hard no one.
And in human society as we
know ft, the meek always in-
herit the earth.

Six feet of it.

would make a great soldier.
Unlike his soft older brother,
the average 10 year-old is in
top physical condition. Since
he hasn't been corrupted by
SDS and New York Times anti-
war propaganda he'll lack
mental reservations about
fighting. And fresh from hours
of TV viewing and model build-
ing he'll! be thoroughly versed
in modern combat techniques.

Training 10 year-olds at
Fort Dix” would be simple.
For example search-and-de-
stroy techniques could be
taught under the code name
of “hide and go seek.’ And
the young soldier would need
minimal training in how to
handle a spiked yo-yo or na-
palm-filled squirt gun.

Even if there were occasion-
al misfires, 10 year-olds would
still be the best men for the
job. From a public relations
standpoint it would be much
better to blame a child for
bombing a school than a griz-
zled Air Force reservist. Be-
sides who ever heard of a 10-
year-old imperialist? ;

In the field the new soldiers
could develop worthwhile in-
novations. Besides tin can
walkie-talkies the young fight-
ers might use kites instead of
smoke ‘bombs to point out tar-
gets to pilots.

The new soldiers would
greatly reduce discipline prob-
lems in the service. One of the
most frequent complaints from
Saigon is that American sol-
diers have turned the city into
a brothel. Not only would 10
year-olds end this but they
would curb the social disease
rate.

The new troops would also
help curtail black market ac-
tivities. Many PX items like
razor blades and shaving
cream would not be sold any
longer. Besides, who would
want to buy hot copies of Mad
Magazine and Superman?

Bubble gum, incidentally,
would of course replace beer,
although the 10 year - olds
would have to be careful not
to chew in the field. The pops
could give them away to the
enemy.

While this plan does have its
defect. Bob Hope would have
to stay home during Christ-
mas, and junior high school
enroliment might drop—over-
all it is in the national inter.
est.

Not only does it aid the mil-
itary but it helps the colleges.

library addict into a dissipat-
ed Continental.

In other words, the social
and many of the educational
aspects of the Davidson Junior
Year at Montpellier may or
may not conform to the image
the student has formed of
them — that depends entirely
on him and his character.

The one side of life at Mont-
pellier which will strike him
almost immediately, however,
is the academic life of the
French student here. It will
strike him because it is so en-
tirely different from what he
has been led to expect.

Where are all the interested,
involved French students he
heard about repeatedly from
Davidson professors in the
spring orientation meetings?
Where they are is in the minds
of these Davidson professors—
which professors. as a rule,
have spent no time closely
connected with French student
life within the last ten years,
at the least.

The fact is that today’s av-
erage French student is not
by any stretch of the imagina-
tion an “involved’’ person.
Whereas 10 years ago any
one of the unversities in
France could have been com-
pared in some degree to, say.
a Berkeley. because of mass
protests of government poli-
cies, student “‘lie-ins" in front
of troop trains headed for Al-
geria, and the like, today the
atmosphere at the same uni-
versities is one of apathy to-
wards politics or almost any
form of social concern.

True, there are student po-
litical organizations such ‘as
the National Federation of
Students, the Students’ Mutu-
alist Federation, and even
Communist student groups,
but they are a small minority
in the university, and their
activities are restricted to
holding ill-attended meetings.
passing out newspapers and
“comic-book” type pamphlets
containing the views of the
Political party backing them,
and littering the ground in
front of the student cafeterias
with unread handbills denounc-
ing America's ‘imperialistic
aggression” in Vietnam — al-
ways a safe policy in France.

The French student is per-
haps less concerned about pol-
itics and the world around
him than the average David.
son student. What he is often
in is the latest
mode, the opposite sex. and
somehow treading his way
through the maze of Faculte
requirements for a degree, in
four or five years at the least.

Perhaps the stabilization of
the government by De Gaulle’s
almost totalitarian tactics has
taken away the incentive for
expression of student opinion.
In the early 1950’s when the
Prime Minister and cabinet
played musical chairs month-
ly, and French politics were
more exciting than even
French driving, I believe that
students were more involved
because in the turmoil of near
anarchy there was more of a
chance of being heard.

Now whether they are heard
or not doesn’t matter. What
does matter now is what “Le
Grarid Charles” personally
feels is the right policy for
France to follow.

This present day stabiliza-
tion of control from Paris can
also be seen very clearly in
the French university system.
Here it seems to have result-
ed in not only stabilization but
also stagnation—stagnation of
initiative and ideas.

Each French university is
composed of several Facultes,
which are similar to a combi-
nation of American post-gradu-

ate and under-graduate’ schools
in a certain field (such as Jaw,
medicine. or arts and letters).
Each Faculte has its local:
head, but the regional univer.
sity as a whole is directed
from Paris. to which the local
heads of the Facultes are re-
sponsible. Thus the needs for
each university and its Fac.
ultes and the remedies for
these needs are judged re
motely from Paris—a system
that is far from efficient or
effective.

Whereas in the early 1900's
the French system of educa-
tion was generally admired in
America and regarded as su-
perior to ours, now it seems
to be (and indeed is generally
acknowledged as being) inferi-
or to the American system.

The reason is that while the
American system has stead-
ily improved. mainly because
of continued excellence in
some private universities and
colleges, and continual ad-
vancement of technique and
freedom of ideas in both pub-
lic and private education, the
French system has by and
large stood still, and as a re-
sult of this has fallen behind.

The French student is still
expected to do his own re-
search for any given course,
receiving a detailed coverage
of only one aspect of the
course in classsroom lectures
(some of which have required
attendance and “‘homework’"’).
But how can he effectively
pursue this policy of ‘“‘aca-
demic freedom'’ when the uni-
versity libraries have far too
few books, have almost no
system of cataloguing them,
let him take them out for only
24 hours at a time, and when
even the Faculte Jibraries
themselves fight over posses-
sion of the books?

It is easy to see how the
student, frustrated by this in-
efficient bureaucracy which
has become a daily part of
university life, has come from
a position of involvement ‘and
interest, to that typical of to-
day — shrugging his shoul-
ders, hurling paper airplanes
at the professors. and mum.
bling. ‘Je m'en fou: (Rough-
ly translated: ‘I don’t give a
damn."')

As Dr. T. A, Williams, Da-
vidson advisor in France this
year, remarked, “France
seems to have come to a cru-
clal period in its educational
system in the last ten years—
and turned away.’ There is °
talk now in France of remod-
eling the educational system
after that of the U.S.. but to
do so would take a great deal
of initiative and time — and
a completely new structure
would have to be employed.

If French education. keeps
watching the world go by
much longer, the situation will
be hopeless, but indeed there
now seems to be no hope for
throwing off the tyranny of
the university's rubber-stamp,
bureaucratic dictatorship.

While the above does not re-
semble the picture generally
accepted at Davidson—among
the faculty in particular—it is
a fact. The decline in quality
of the French educational sys-
tem should not frighten off or
discourage any prospective
Junior Year Abroad applicant:
this one chance for him to re-
ally learn something for him-
self while enrolled at Da-
vidson, through independent
study. not to mention the op-
portunities for traveling and
increasing his awareness of
the world in general, will
make it by far the most
worthwhile, enjoyable, and ex-
citing year of his entire edu-
cational career.
