THE STORAGE AREA, reminiscent of the Charlotte city dump, contains a diverse collection

of lumber, pipe and other second-hand building materials. It’s size has decreased in recent
years, but it still stands as a memorial to such early buildings as Rumple, Georgia and West Garm-

itories.

Scenic Ghetto Of Grime:
Dump Or Storage Area?

BY WILLIAM WALKER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Brick-bats, plumber’s pipe, cracked concrete conduits and torn tar paper; piles
of weathered two-by-fours, coils of rusted wire, battered hot water tanks, and two

monstrous, gutted gas tanks.

These are among the scenic
wonders to greet the. casual
busybody when he wanders in-
to the fenced-off area behind the
college laundry.

All of the unwanted and ir-
reparable refuse of the past 35
years of building and demolition
at. Davidson: College seems ‘to
preserve itself in the 200 foot
strip of blackened earth known
as the college “storage area.”

ENCLOSED BY FENCE

Enclosing this ghetto of grime
is a relatively new. six foot
heavy duty wire fence, lined ir-
regularly with shrubs, holly
bushes. and small, feeble
cedars, Morning glories grow
profusely on and around the
stacks of wood and brick. and
incongruously, there are wither-
ed roses on the fence.

In the college business office, heating plant has been there,

questions about “the junk pile”
behind the laundry drew blank
expressions at first. Then Busi-
ness Manager Robert A. Currie
rushed to the defense of the
area.

“It's sort of 4 supply dump.”
Currie said. ‘In fact. it’s not any
dump. it's a storage area. If a
building is torr down, what we
don’t destroy or turn over to the
contractors, we consign to the
area behind the laundry.”

IMMUTABLE RELIC

Currie was not sure exactly
when the storagé area had been
instituted.Fortunately, however,
College Engineer Oscar J. Thies
happened to be present. Thies
said, “I think the brick building
of the heating plant was built
around 1915 or 1920. Sinee the

REGINALD GARDINER

Series Artist Tells.

Tales Witty And Wise

Reginald Gardiner will tell “Tales Witty and Wise” ;
in Chambers Auditorium on Nov, 14 at 8:15 p.m. He will
be the second of six performers to participate in this

year’s Artist Series.

After being graduated from
the Royal Academy of Dramatic
Arts in England. Gardiner play-
ed various roles, including
Shakespeare. Shaw, and O'Neill,
in that country.

He made his American debut
with Beatrice Lillie in New York
in “At Home Abroad.” Gardiner
returned to England for a com-
mand performance before the
late King George VI. Back on
Broadway, he played in “The
Show’s On.”

Eleanor Powell. who was also

the area has been used for stor-
age.. The College has since put
up a very fine fnce and has put
up shrubs to shield it.”

Thies said that before the
building of the new fraternity
court in 1957 the entire area of
college property behind the
laundry had been used for this
purpose. Then, with the advent
of the court, the fence with its
struggling bushes had been put
up. and the storage area con-
fined within it. |

And so, while buildings rise!
and fall, the college stprage area
remains, an immutable relic and
record of their falling, and a'
potential hey-day for the
archaelologists of post-fall-out!
America.

“We already have qualified

Dr. Hopkins has been taking
