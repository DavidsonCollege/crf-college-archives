VIGILANCE COMMITTEE

(Continued from page 1)

the committee once a week to bring
up any case where the rules have
been violated. If a Fresh has to be
brought up the second time the Stu-
dent Council will take action. These
rules and regulations are made to
protect the new men from hazing.
If they will abide by these laws the
old form of hazing will be abolished.
The paddle will lose its popularity
and the frequent farce prayer meet-
ings will be discontinued. This will
give the Freshmen a continuous re-
minder that their place is not to be
the most conspicuous in college ex-
cept the mark of their rank as a be-
ginner. If both Fresh and upper
classmen will give their wholeheart-
ed support, hazing will be abol-
ished. °

BLUE RIDGE CONFERENCE

(Continued from page 6)
resented Davidson at the Y. M. C.
A. conference last summer.

It is impossible, of course, to ex-

ress entirely the ways in which

lue Ridge gives one this feeling.
But the dining hall exerts as much
influence towards making this pep
and loyalty as any other one thing.
Not because of what they give you
to eat, though and abundance of ap-
etizing dishes served by pretty col-
ege girls does not destract from the
meal hour—it is the boys them-
selves that get up that spirit.

The picked men from every cam-
pus in.the south are there, and every
group wishes to convince the others

that its college is the best. And
| they do it by seeing who can give its
| col ege yells the loudest.

The dining room is a bedlam of
sound for a half hour three times a
day. No sooner has one college
given its yells than another starts

a”

out—sometimes two—see which can
drown the other out. With “Wooly”
Grey as cheer leader, the Davidson
contingent did nobly. But it had a
hard time competing with groups
that had two to three times her
number. With 50 men there this
summer, however, Davidson will
show ’em all up
The Classroom Work Far From
Irksome

Four hours of each regular day
at Blue Ridge are spent in some
form of classroom work. At 8:30
in the morning comes the Bible class
hour, which is the only one for
which outside preparation is expect-
ed. The classes take up various
Bible study text-books and are con-
ducted very much in the same man-
ner as the classes here. Then comes
the College Conference Hour, in
which the classes are divided ac-
cording to the position each man
expects to fill in his home Y. M. C.
A. The next hour is divided into
conferences on the various life call-
ings the men expect to enter. Final-
ly, at 8:20 at night, classes meet to
discuss various “human problems”
both at home and abroad.

Athletics an Enjoyable Feature

Probably one of the foremost fea-
tures of attraction at Blue Ridge is
found in athletics. The afternoons
are entirely given over to the men to
use as they choose, and soon after
the opening of the conference,
schedules are arranged in baseball,
basketball, volley ball,and tennis.

Last year practically every dele-
gation had teams in most of the
leagues. Davidson started out like
a whirlwind, beating Auburn in
baseball,: Miss. A. & M. in volley
ball, and walking entirely away
from some other school in tennis.
All these triumphs came in the same
afternoon and for one night at least
Davidson was a by-word all over
the conference. For some reason it
has become customary among the
men who were there last summer to

stop at this point in discoursing upon
their achievements in the athletic
line, and this is probably not a fit-
ting time to break silence. Ask one
of these men and possibly he can
explain why.

n addition to the forms mention-
ed above, there is a swimming pool,
with diving stands and springboards
which feels mighty fine after a game
or a long mountain climb.

It is rumored that this year other
North Carolina schools are going to
make it a point to send good teams
to Blue Ridge. Davidson can’t af-
ford to do other than likewise.
