SO YEARS OLD

Fleas
come with
the dog

An old mountaineer sat
rocking under an oak tree on a
summer afternoon as he was be-
ing pried by a visiting ‘newspa-
perman. Frail and lame, he had
not been away from his home for
some time.

“The town’s getting big, I
guess?” he asked.

Upon being assured that it
was, he offered, “You never get
the dog without the fleas.”

“What do you mean?” asked
the reporter.

“You never get the dog with-
out the fleas,” he said. “big dog,
active dog, more fleas.”

In his homespun way, the
old timer was being quite a phi-
losopher. It is certainly quite
apropos to our day and time.
Davidson is ina state of mutabil-
ity and expansion. Our nation is
big and getting bigger. There
are many added problems-major
and minor-inherent in this sta-
tus.

From an agricultural people
we have changed to a predomi-
‘| nantly urban clan. A kind of
mass urban man is appearing

the South and West. Although
the comforts and improvement
in the standard of living have
been accepted gratefully, we are
fearful about our standards of
life. The crux of the matter is
that the individual man in this
society is not solid spiritually,
Discontent has arisen in him.

It is absurd to assume that
we can still go on thinking in the
terms of the old concepts and
formulas. It ought to be rather
obvious that these conditions,
with the influences of group
thinking and psychology, require
some new formulas. We must
solve these and other problems-
and find a solution for that sensi-
tive wistful fear that is in each of
us.

This is why we are at
Davidson. Great moral courage
_and force, and a true sense of
spiritual values, are needed to-
day more than ever before. As
we struggle along the trail that
leads to the great mass-man civi-
lization, we must find a way to
make the great teachings of
books, of minds,. of religious
truth, freely available along the
way. It ought to begin here if it
has not already evidenced itself
in our lives.

We must learn to take the
fleas with the dog-the bad with
the good-and press on through

and our God. And, as always
there are signs that we will; that
deep within us is some mysteri-
ous indefinable element of Gcd-
given spirit which is our reser-
voir of strength in timé of need.
And this is the aim of education.

Blueprints & Groundbreakings

By Casey Rogers

With the war-torn forties fi-
nally over, Davidson could again
concentrate on the eduacation of
young men. While daily life at
Davidson during the late fifties
and early sixties differed substan-
tially from life at the present, some
events in this decade have molded
our institution into its present form.
The Davidsonian was there to
cronicle these changes.

A decade of building

The Davidson campus saw
more construction during this ten-
year period than any other in its
history. When the students re-
turned to school in the fall of 1955,
many lugged their belongings into
their new home in Belk Dormi-
tory. The Davidsonian reported
that the “large modern dormitory”
cost around $900,000 and could
house over 700 Davidson students.
During the next year, The David-
sonian reported the dismantling of
Rumple and Georgia dorms and
the plans for the new Little Dorm.

With enrollment increasing
every year, Davidson’s 12 frater-
nities were beginning to feel the
squeeze in their quaint, cramped
homes on.Jackson Court. On the
first Friday in April, 1957, the news
section of The Davidsonian pre-
sented an architect’s vision of the
new Patterson Court houses.

Davidson then turned its fo-
cus to enhancing the campus’s
classrooms. In early 1958, The
Davidsonian reports plans for the
new Dana Science Building. Inthe
fall of the following year, the col-
lege announced construction of the
Cunningham Fine Arts Center,
named for the recently-retired
Davidson President Dr. John R.
Cunningham.

The building frenzy contin-
ued into the sixties. Plan’s for
Richardson Hall were unveiled in

. the January 13th issue of “The

South’s Foremost College
Weekly,” while the birth of
Davidson’s lake campus was an-
nounced on September 28th, 1962.
: How much
for the women?

Because of Davidson’s all-
male status, the social life centered
around events that would attract
women to campus. Yes, these
weekends were an oasis in the
desert of academia. As one student
put it in 1954, these festive week-
ends brought “the indescribable
invasion of skirts from the
outerworld,”

Homecoming reigned su-
preme among such events, but the
traditional Midwinters and Spring
Frolics weekends also generated
excitement. One year, The David-
sonian reported an expenditure of
$61,000 for homecoming week-
end.
The Davidson men, however,
were not deprived of entertainment
during the rest of the year. The
Davidsonian contained a monthly
listing of the movies being shown
in the Union. In March of 1954, for
instance, the paper announced
screenings of All the King's Men
and Miracle on 34th Street.

The 1958-59 Davidsonian top staffers included the following men pictured here in a conference
George Ramsey, Ed Armfield, Jim Hamilton, Laurens Walker, Bill Patton, Dick Smith, and Charles

Chastain.

The Artists Series also offered
an outlet for entertainment. In
1954, the Davidson community
enjoyed the sounds of Louis
Armstrong. Burl Ives and Ogden

Nash performed in the 1955 Artist -

Series.
Life at Davidson
The late Chalmers Davidson
proclaimed that “Davidson isa way

of life.” The library’s volumes of -

back Davidsonian issues create

- detailed annals of this way of life.

Acasual glance through these back
issues depicts life at Davidson be-
tween 1954 and 1963.

The first issue of 1956 con-
tained a listing of rules and regula-
tions for Davidson students. Here
are a few unusual ones:

PARADES: “‘Student parades
must be limited to the campus and
athletic field.” Thoughtfully, we
can now have our student parades
wherever we wish;

DRINKING: “Davidson Col-
lege is opposed as a matter of prin-
ciple to the use of alcoholic bever-
ages by Davidson students.” Now
there’s an alcohol policy for you;

PASSING BACK: “The pro-
cedure of passing students from
place to place in the Chambers
auditorium over the heads of other

students is believed to be poten-

tially dangerous and to be unbe-
coming ata student assembly.” No
doubt this was a popular exercise
at those crazy, wacky Burl Ives
concerts.

Although the rules were a bit
different then, some Davidson cus-

toms and institutions that impact _

current classes of Davidson pupils
developed during this period. On
November 17th, 1958, Student
Body President John Kuykedall
announced that the student body
had voted in favor of creating an
Honor Council.
Sports Stuff

Each issue of The Davidso-
nian reported news of school ath-
letics in-a column called “Sports
Stuff,” which reported on both
varsity sport news and the latest in
the Interfraternity sports scene. In
1953, it reported that Davidson
was “gearing up” to play Georgia
Tech. In October of 1956, the
headline explains that soccer was
added to Davidson’s collection of

varsity sports. In that same year,
KA claimed the flickerball trophy
(the game was around even then!),
On February 23, 1962, the column
featured a picture of Terry Holland
playing a little roundball for the
Wildcats. :
Learning

The Davidsonian followed the
school’s academic program and
those who administered it. In the
spring of 1956, Davidson hired its
first female faculty member,
Caroline MacBrayer, an instructor
in psychology.

That fall, the college an-
nounced a competion for admis-
sion into a new program studying

western civilization: the
Humanties program. On February
20th, 1957, Davidson reluctantly
congratulated John Cunningham
on his retirement and thanked him
for his 17 years of service; on May
15th, 1958, the college welcomed
Greir Martin as the new president.

Asmall college like Davidson
creates aunique community of stu-
dents and mentors... For 80 years,
The Davidsonian has kept thiscom-
munity on top of the happenings in
its own little corner of the world.
The stories run during the school
years from 1954 to 1964 help ex-
plain why we have the Davidson
we have today.
