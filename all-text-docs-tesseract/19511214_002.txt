Entered as second class matter at the Post Office at Davidson,
N. C., under the Act of: March 3, 1897,

Dear Governor:
This One’s Been Forgotten

The man who brought better roads to North Carolina
missed one when he came in the back door to Davidson: Wednes-
day.

Had Governor Kerr Scott swung his executive auto around
by way of Charlotte and battled his way up Highway 21 to
Davidson, The Honorable—as a country boy—would have
recognized a country road masquerading as a first class highway.
And being the man of action he is, Davidson students would
probably have departed South for Christmas holidays on a re-
conditioned road. ;

But as no such doings came to pass, the Davidson student.
the Charlotte commutors from Huntersville, Cornelius, Davidson.
Mooresville, Statesville. and outlying communities: the bus and
truck drivers and the business men traveling from Charlotte and
points South northward to West Virginia and above, must con-
tinue to play the part of ‘‘Hell-Drivers” on a hazardous layout.
They must steel themselves for the unexpected from blind hills
and curves: they must continue the tortuous task of tight-rope
driving down the thin ribbon between soft shoulders and crumb-
ling roadsides on the one side, and a passing vehicle which pretty
well fills the other. Too, there's to be tested the skill of the
driver on old Death Curve, where a wrong way bank threatens
to pitch you over into a Burma-Shave sign, literally at every turn.
The signs haven't even been changed in five years.

We're sorry we missed talking to Governor Scott. We honest-
ly believe he would have taken our case to heart. But we're send-
ing this issue of The Davidsonian along to him with the hope
that he’ll look: it over. His modesty to the contrary. we know
there's something an old N. C. State ag major can teach us
preachers about safety.

Quo Vadis May Have The Goods
Hidden Down Between Its Lines

Like the picture of the same name, Quo Vadis showed itself
first in preview, promising that newspapers are going to be better
than ever.

It is questionable whether the publication qualifies as a
newspaper in its overemphasis on the essay: -it filled itself with
apologies for failure to say anything and with promises to say
something in the future; it vowed its non-competitive state with
The Davidsonian, and yet has since boasted orally of its mail
count outdrawing this paper's.

But for all its misgivings, the work of Brinkley-Crutchfield-
Hope-Hunter-Stuart did not go unnoticed—completely. While
the mimeographed form hardly lent itset? to complete readability
by the average leaving-chapel-going-to-class Davidson man, it
made him aware that something new was in circulation. For
that reason many read in part. and though not understanding
in full, were stimulated to thought. And thought in fields long
since deserted by hopelessness or complacency.

; The organization is backed by some good minds with, we
think, good intent. Last Friday’s advent of Quo Vadis along
with the give and take over ODK’s program created a campus.
interest of the nature seldom seen in these parts. »

May we expect the full length showing after the holidays?

Christmas Gift Fund Offers
Spirit Of Giving Expression

“Merry Christmas and God bless you all,"’ shouted Charles
Dicken's beloved little character, Tiny Tim.

When Christmas time rolls around and another year totters
towards its end, our thoughts quite jubilantly melt into the
spirit of good cheer. It is time for the hearty handshake, color-
ful Christmas cards, and it is a time for heart-warming melodies
of traditional carols to permeate the air. Christmas is a time of
giving and receiving.

But inevitably, every Christmas brings with it its Scrooges.
There are always those who look forward to Christmas as just
another worry. Just another shopping list to be marked off,
another financial hardship, another annoyance—this is Christ-
mas to the shrinking. cringing, commercial creature of today
| that scoffs at the celebration of the birth of our Savior. Giving?
What does giving mean to the modern Scrooge? He doesn’t know
the meaning of Christian benevolence.

Consider the broad Christian outlook which the gift fund
embraces.
Our gift is earmarked as a gift which is interracial. It is a
+ gift which will do good in our own town of Davidson. In North
,Carolina’s Caswell Training School it will aid a group of people
who are physically and mentally unable to help themselves. Our
'{gift is international in scope. It sends aid abroad to a people
=who are in desperate need.
i These purposes are truly Christian purposes which are
| worthy of attention this Christmas season.—G.H.Mc.

Scene One

(The scene is that of a high,
golden-hued arch, resting on a
vari-colored cloud, with its key-

"stone a large, triangular. piece
of pecan pie. Across the top of
the arch in ornate old-English
lettering are the words, HEA-

VEN, U. S. Just to the right

and below the gates is a large

oaken desk; clear, except for a

book of catechism and two

wicker baskets labeled “In” and

“Out.” Behind the | desk

stands a vertical file of four

drawers. They are also labeled
in old-English: Committees on

Getting In, Committees on Get-

ting Out, Committees on Com-

mittees, and Christianity and

Miscelleny.

Saint Peter is sitting at the
desk, his brow furrowed pious-
ly, his busy hands shifting the
“In” papers to the “Out” bas-
ket and back again to the “In”
basket. Assorted angels sur-
round’ the desk, each straining
to kiss his own elbow. From
stage left an archangel in a
natty blue pin-stripe suit and
conservative tie enters.

Arch.: S. P., I've got a couple of
fellows I'd like you to see for a
moment, if you don't mind. S.P.:
Archie, I've told you a thousand
times not to bother me in Decem-

Earth this month, it’s as much

Dear Editor:

May I first congratulate you on
reviewing your record as a student
newspaper cditor.. Despite the fact
that it took a few well-aimed siate-
ments by one of your critics to get
you to look at yourself even from
a prejudiced viewpoint, I am glad
to see some reaction. Although you
dismissed it as coming from an un-
informed non-reader, you obviously
considered Mr. Hope's letter im-
portant enough to merit full edi-
torial comment. In my opinion he
was just trying to stimulate a little
thought on the subject and seems
to have accomplished his purpose
well, judging from the length of
last week's “public letter.”

I should also like to question
your interpretation of a “live”
presentation of issues.

I would be the first to agree with
you that live issues have found
their way into the paper, but they
ate almost never given a live pre-
sentation, Except for a few excep-
tions you have failed to offer any-
thing but a casual mention. On the
question of the D Club request for
a dance in Charlotte you merely
asked the question: “Is executive
committee policy on dances well-
founded?” Now here’s an issue
which could well effect every one
of us. Most of us could see the

not. What do you think I assigned
all those recruiting sergeants to

Arch.: Oh sure, and I’m not look-
ing a gift horse in the mouth,
either, But, you see, this is one of
those celebrity cases. Both of these

traffic fatality somewhere down
there, and they're right het up about
who died first. Claim you're about

Oh yeah? Blast their conceit, any-
way! That's the way it is with all
these humans we get up here; think
we have nothing else to do all day
but sit around and watch them
make mistakes, Pshaw! its enough
that we know beforehand when,
where and how they're going to
make them; have we got to sit
around and applaud them just be-
cause they follow The Plan? Where
are these men from? Arch.: One of
them’s a bum; from almost any-
where, 1 guess. S. P.: Well, that’s
nothing against him. We've got
quite a number of them here. How
about the other one? Arch: He's

the committee’s side of it, The
general conclusion among the stu-
dent body was thae they couldn’t
do something, but they didn’t know
why. Rulings like that aren't pulled
out of a hat—inform us. You jump
up and down and pat yourself on
the back for some simple, insig-
nificant thing like getting tne heat
cut back two notches in the library,
and then you completely ignore
problems like our election system,
the lack of adequate scholarship
funds, closer participation of facul-
ty and students in joint projects.
Last year the ball was set rolling
to study the problem of rush week,
but where is it now? Did somebody
fumble? Bryan Robinson has dem-
onstrated what interest merely step-
ping outside our homogeneous
shell can arouse. :

Why can’t we exercise our
mental faculties outside the
classroom a little more and not
only express sincere opinions,
bute defend every man’s right
to do the same?

The Davidsonian should be the
organ of that free expression which
isn't afraid to take criticism: and
benefit from it.

You have obviously tried to cover
up point by point everything Sam
suggested without really taking his
suggestions seriously. In your first

student’s side, but we didn’t hear point you suggested that your

NAT DANIEL:

The First Christmas Message;
Our Forgotten Responsibility

The streets and store windows
have been decorated, the Santa
Clauses hired, the advertising pro-
grams begun, and once more the
jingle-jangle of cash register bells
usher in Christmas—the American
Winter vacation.

In these days of bathtubs and
television sets, getting seems to
have replaced giving in our minds
and hearts, and the intangible some-
thing known as the Christmas spirit
tucked away in a dust-laden corner
and forgotten,

But Christmas should mean
more to us than a season of get-
ting gifts, and entertaining the
right people, and keeping up
with the Joneses. It wasn't
established by the American
business man to promote mid-
winter sales, Christmas has re-
mained with us throughout the
centuries to remind us that
Christ was born in Bethlehem
to be the Savior of the world,
and was the most generous of
all gifte-—God's gift to hie way-
ward and stubborn children.
The song the angels sang to the

Judean shepherds, and the star the
wise men saw were not meant for
them alone, but were the first

Christmas greetings. In the moment
they appeared, the simple peasants
and the oriental sages became the
whole of humanity, and though cen-
turies have passed since they knelt
before ‘the manger, mankind is still
groping in darkness, though light
has been provided.

The Shepherds and the Wise
Men, having received the
Heavenly messages, brought to
the Child gifts—the first Chriet-
mas gifts. Brought them be-
cause they loved, and honored,
and respected the Christ child,
and not in hopes of receiving
anything in return. And they
gave these gifts from their
hearts.

As these first gifts were given
in generosity, and respect and love,
so should our gifts be, for later
Christ said, “If ye have done it
unto the least of these my breth-
ren, ye have done it unto me.”

The wise men and shepherds
were also the first Christmas cele-
brators. They did not, however,
dance with joy, and throw a big
party, but bowed before the manger
and worshiped, praising God for
bringing into the world in the per-
son of His son, Hope, Love and

FROM _THE EDITOR’S MAILBOX:

Robinson Slams Beard And Daniels;
Asks Where Is Davidson’s School Spirit?

Dear Shellcy and Nat:
Before defending the ODK pro-

‘gram in general and in particular,

there are several points of fact that
I should like to clear up.

You, Nat, in criticising the
program made several state-
ments that simply are not fact.

I will take them in order.

“He (I) is guilty of jumping on
somebody else’s bandwagon.” You
accuse me of doing this in four
instances; Hell Week, the Blood
Drive, the YMCA project, and the
Baker Scholars project.

(a). Hell Week to Help—Here
you say that I am attempting to
horn in on the glory after the
dirty work has been done, I was
aware last spring that all this was
going on, since I am a fraternity
president. I talked to Dick Stook-
ton early this fall, and asked him
if ODK could work with the Pan-
Hel on this project. He agreed
saying that we could probably help
best by acting as advisors, and by
simply letting.it be known that we
were behind it. I'll admit that the
project read as if wep the ODK,
had done the work, and this syas
corrected in last week’s paper. As
for horning in on the glory, I sug-
gest that you go talk to Dick and
see if he will corroborate this.

(b). The Blood Drive—Fairly
early in the fall, Col. Ballard, an
ODK member, asked if ODK
would sponsor the Blood Drive in
the student body, as it had done
last year. We agreed, and Bill White
handled this for us.

(c). Compulsory Membership in

the YMCA—Here again I am ac-
cused of being behind, this time by
three jumps, I have been a member
of the Y Cabinet for two years, and
am aware that this issue was being
raised, I asked Allen Strand, prior
to the article being published, if
ODK could work with the Y on
that project. He agreed.

(d). Acting as hosts for the
Baker Scholars—"“for ODK to
usurp their (the present Bakers)
jobs seems absurd, besides being
impolite.” I will now quote from a
letter written by Prof. B. D.
Thompson, chairman of the Schol-
atship Committee:

“ODK has rendered the col-
lege a valuable service in each
of the past three years by as-
sisting the Baker Scholarship
Committee with the finalists
who come to the campus in the
spring ... I shall welcome the
cooperation of ODK again this

”

I received this letter prior to the
article.

Have you ever leaned back, Nat
and Shelley, in your chairs, and en-
visaged a student body and faculty
that was traly interested in the edu-
cational process. What would be
different about them, as compared
with us? There would be at least
two important differences. First,
they would realize that they are now
in the stream of life, that life is not
something that we begin to live
after we gradiiate from college,
Every issue is a moral issue, worthy
of discussion and of serious
thought. Second, they would be

Peace to a troubled world. And so
the Christmas spirit is a spirit of
joyful, thankful and humble wor-
ship.

Despite the wars and famines
and destruction which has more
than once atiempted to destroy all
that is good in man, the spirit
which Christmas symbolizes lives on
though the modern American seems
to have forgotten that fact. Noth-
ing can grow without nourishment,
and today, as never before in his-
tory we are challenged to let the
spirit that is in Christmas become
the important influence in our lives
in order to prevent atom destruc-
tion from without and a moral dis-
integration from within.

And so as we go home to parties,
and friends, and families, let us
not forget the real significance and
the true promise of Christmas:

For unto us a child is born,
unto us a son is given: and the
Government shall rest upon his
shoulder: and his name shall
be called Wonderful, Coun-
sellor, The mighty God, The
everlasting Father, The Prince
of Peace.

~Isaiah 9:6.

vitally interested in student life, in
all sorts of issues, and in thinking
out for themselves the solutions to
the various problems that we are
presented with every day.

With us, however, there is a
decided apathy to many live
issues, and we reduce the edu-
cational process to a sort of
gentleman's game, in which the
best player is he who does as
little work as possible while
“shooting” the professor on re-
views and exams.

An attempt to overcome these
differences was the broad back-
ground for our program for the
year. It is always difficult to trans-
late ideals into concrete realities.
We had much rather work with
other groups on the campus than to
do their work for them. But, some-
times, it is impossible to integrate
or appraise a group that does noth-
ing.

T’lt admit that a Negro stu-
dent on this campus would not
be a happy person, judged by
crdinary standards,

I would not like to see one come,
unless he knew exactly what he
were stepping into. He would know
that he would be snubbed, that
various social problems would pre-
sent themselves, etc. He would
come prepared to give up most
of his social life. He would do this
because he would be working for
@ cause that was more important
than his own pleasures. Sure, there
would be problems, but let’s don't
lose sight of the forest for the

(Continued On Page Four)

“hope that the new (chapel) pro-
gram would meet continued suc-
cess” was enough to adequately
present the issue, Of course we all
were glad to see the recent pro-
gress, but that doesn’t mean the
issue is settled or that further con-
sideration isn't merited, I’m not
trying to suggest that we keep
needling ourselves with thorny is-
sues, but one article wf “hope” is
hardly an adequate presentation of
any issue.
On the second point I believe
you missed the purpose of
ATO's work with its pledges.

ATO as a national fraternity has
tong urged the abolition of the so-
called Hell Week tactics, but to
my knowledge the local chapter
has not backed any Greek Week
plan at all. Understand I am not
saying that any fraternity would
not back Mr. Adam’s plan, but I
believe you have read into ATO’s
action more than you were justified
in doing. As a member of ATO I
whole-heartedly back an intelligent
use of fraternal brotherhood, but
ATO has not arbitrarily aligned
itself behind anybody's plan.

On the question of holidays
I ask if you really consider
being told that an article is
unnecessary warrants dropping
the issue.

I believe Sam had in mind the all-
inclusive subject of holidays and
not just the past Thanksgiving.
Naturally the question of holidays
is tied in very closely with that of
cuts. Yet a critical analysis of either
is virtually unknown, In both in-
stances we are treated like little
boys whose parents are afraid we
will come home at the wrong time.
Maybe that policy is expedient for
freshmen, but the maturity of four
yeara’ education surely must be
worth more than eight cuts,

If a senior in college must
be told how many cuts he
should take, there is some-
thing wrong with either the
senior or the system.

Surely there are other possible
systems that can be considered
seriously, such as a basic minimum
number of cuts with additional cuts
earnable on a bonus system for
grades, Not only would that pro-
duce incentive for better grades,
but it would make the student work
harder to budget his time to his
best advantage, Why can’t you dis-
cuss such alternate plans instead
of sitting back on your laissez-faire
haunches like a contented cow and
letting the same old issues float
glibly by every year. We are all
sick with indifference, but you're
the sickest because it's your duty

to keep us awake and alive to what’s
going on. This very attittide is what
makes most of us so immature com-
pared to students in northern or
western colleges.

You are quite right that your
lack of letters could be because
of a lack of interest of “affairs
d'college.” But then who should
try to stimulate interest if not
the Davidsonian?

Ts it to be left to an independent
group of writers who must finance
their own paper to get the issues
presented, To my knowledge Quo
Vadis has received more letters
from its one issue than the David-
sonian has all year. These letters
to that paper prove that there is
genuine student and faculty interest
if someone will just bring it out.
It’s true you have printed articles,
but have you presented issues?

I don’t know what the situation
is between you and the staff, bit
couldn’t you put to work the good
talent in many of those who are
doing nothing and replace those
who are not qualified for what they
are trying to do? Why not remove
some of that rehashed news and
invite more faculty comment?

We can read the Charlotte

papers for a qualified account
of world events; our pa-

per, paid for by us, should
bring to light everything it
possibly can about the college,
its professors, administration,
students, and those things rele-
vant to our life here.

Several of the faculty visited
other nations recently; others: have
done special work in interesting and
pertinent fields, which would have
not only interesting, but informa-
tional and enlightening value for us.
The recent British election could
have been the occasion for using
this advantage. The field is wide
open, and I am confident it is will-
ing to be exploited. Instead you
let an inexperienced student who
isn’t in the least qualified, tackle
a problem ten couldn't handle,

Finally I should again like to of-
fer compliments for what I hope
is your new turn. I would extend
my congratulations to a few of your
writers who have done a good job
of keeping their eyes open. The
second page is better than in any
previous year I have known, But
please don’t let this long-needed
enthusiasm die here. It shouldn't
take outsiders to prod you on.

With the proper use of your
staff you can make the David-
sonian the finest paper of ite
class. .

Yours very truly,
GEORGE BRINKLEY.
