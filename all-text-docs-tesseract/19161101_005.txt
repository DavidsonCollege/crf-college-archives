THE FORUM _

MISCONDUCT IN CHURCH.

In the recent issue of the College
Magazine, under the head of “Thoughts
—A Series of Chats,” the editor takes
up the question of disturbance caused
by the students in church. We quote
from this article as follows: ‘This
practise does not come from a lack of
religious feeling. but from a lack of ap-
preciation for form. College students
are not generally irreligious; they are
American. They do not stamp on the
floor out of disrespect for God, but of
form and ceremony.”

On this point we wish to take issue
with the Magazine Editor. The princi-
ple causes, we believe, are the natural
restlessness of younger people at re-
straint. for any length of time and also
the idea of compulsory attendance.
These have bred an irreverance, a type
of selfishness, and of cowardice, which
should be considered for what they are
and rooted out of their conduct. The
House of God is no place for miscon-
duct, and any acts of this sort are glar-
ingly irreverent in spirit and in deed
toward Him. They are selfish also be-
cause they rebel at restraint which robs
them of a few minutes of case, and the
fact that so many other persons are being
benefited by the services does not seem
to occur to them. And in the third

place, this conduct is cowardly because} ”

it is deliberately done in the knowledge

that there is little likelihood of detec-| -

tion. If each of the students who are]:
muilty of this, knew that his action
would become known, how many of

them would persist in it, and further.)
haw many of them would continue it or] =

even conceive of it if their own mothers
or sisters happened to be attending serv-
ices with them? The students who are
responsible for this, show that they are

carelessly indifferent 10 some of the most:
sacred things, and also that they lack a],
sense of the true valuation of their|.

duties and privileges.

HUMOR.
“Serious and conservative Davidson”

was given a delightful taste of humor|&

by Dr. Whaling in his speech last

Thursday, and, having received such aE;

good taste, are we going to hegin to cul-
tivate the art more? If it will deliver
us from the monotonous and_ prosaic
here on the campus, we need it.

The man who, as occasion demands,
can respond with a joke, well told, pos-
sesses an enviable accomplishment. We
have at Davidson no end of “bum”
jokes and “cheap” humor. To “pull”
a good joke requires work, time, and
thought—and, to the ordinary man, just
as much of it.

How many will volunteer to “liven
things up” around here with some real,
sure enough humor.

e a
“God of our fathers, be with us yet,

Lest we forget! Lest we forget!’

The spirit of irreverence displayed
last Sunday morning in church by the
few men who do not deserve the honor

of being called students of Davidson) 2

College, can be interpreted only in two
ways. The first cannot he

but simple Jabyishness.
that the disorder was due to rowdyism
of some few “rough-necks.” Any way,
it was the act of cowards, who took
tefuge in the irresponsibility of the mob.

Any true Southerner will show cour-
tesy enough to a visitor or to anyone, to
remain quiet, even under difficulty, no
matter how “dry” or how long that
person may speak. But worse than lack
of courtesy is lack of reverence in the
House of God. Some of Christ’s most

properly| 2
termed prep-schoolism; it was nothing| =
The second is|Z

harsh denunciations were against those
men who did not revere the house of
His Father. —

1 believe most of the students of Dav-
idson would approve a_ step which
placed power in the hands of the Stu-
dent Council to deal justice ¢o such
reprobates.
