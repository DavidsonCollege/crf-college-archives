Staying home

'“., and it stoned me just like going home.”
-Van Morrison

When you become an alum of your high school, you can’t wait to get out. You want
to move on, get things going; you might even avoid the old campus like you would a
malarial swamp.
College alums act differently. They love coming back, reminiscing, visiting friends,
and having an excuse to get crazy drunk like they used to. Some stay longer than they
‘plan and cry because they miss the place. .

There is a correlation between learning and endearment; we love those the most who

teach us the most. Look at The Karate Kid, and notice how Daniel Laruso’s appreciation
for Mr. Miyagi grows when he is shown how washing the car, painting the fence, painting
the house, and sanding the deck have taught him to defend himself. Look at the alums
who returned this past weekend with love for their teachers and fellow students (who are
teachers, too) pouring out of their half-lidded eyes.

“T want to be here again; I want to walk everywhere; I want to know everyone,” said
one alum. He lost security. There is little comfort in a wide expanse of strange sights and
strangers. Here, you are embraced even by the air you walk through.

“My education seems to have stopped. I can’t find the incredible knowledge I found
here,” said another alum. She lost stimulation. Once you are in the mix, you either know
something or you don’t. Here, you have time to learn about it before it runs you over.

“It’s in the atmosphere and in the feel: Our hands were dirty here, and we liked it.
Where can I dirty my hands now?” asked a third graduate. She lost absorption. Anyone
who visits the Careers Office knows that it is not easy to find ajob, internship, or activity
to keep you busy post-May; some follow up commencement with unemployment. Here,
all you have to do is sign up for something, write an article, or go to a meeting, and you’ re
in.

So, is it security, stimulation, and absorption that has such a hold on us and on
graduates? Oris it relationships formed in the context of common experience? Or both?

“Listen. You can hear it,” said one alum. “You can smell it, too. It’s in the air.”

‘What is?” we asked.

“Me. And my class. And everyone who has graduated from this place. We’re in
the air. We’re in the dirt and in the treés. And that’s it — we’ll always be here.”

The Habitat house

To the editors,

We are very excited to
tell you about plans for build-
ing a Davidson College
sponsored Habitat House.
Habitat for Humanity is an
international, ecumenical
organization committed to
the elimination of sub-stan-
dard-housing. Volunteers
work in partnership with
families to build houses and
communities around the
world.

The idea for a Davidson

College sponsored house ~

was aresult of a spark started
by various groups of stu-
dents and staff all over cam-
pus. From a Habitat trip to
Jacksonville last spring
break toa leadership confer-
ence in Charleston in May to
a meeting of the Patterson
Court service coordinators

several weeks ago, we have
been overwhelmed with the
interest expressed in this
project. We are hoping to
use this energy to put the
event in motion.

A group of students, fac-
ulty, and staff have come
together to form the Habitat
House Committee to orga-
nize this event. The com-
mittee is comprised of 26
people who will coordinate
the fundraising, volunteers,
building, publicity, and edu-
‘cation. Forty thousand dol-
lars needs to be raised to
build the house. The build-
ing will be done next semes-
ter. If you would like to be
involved in one of these
groups or hold a fundraiser
for the house, please contact
the committee chairs listed
below. People who would

like to build will have the
opportunity to sign up later.
Youcan get involved in some
of the upcoming events in-
cluding Homeruns for Habi-
tat on October 21, a Kickoff
Event in November, and the
Variety Show on December
2. Watch for “House Jars”
around campus to make your
donation.

It is our sincere desire
that all students, faculty and
staff be involved. If every-
one donated twenty dollars
we would have all the money
we need to build: the house.
Please join us in this excit-
ing campus event. Thanks
in advance for your support.

Sincerely,

Smita Donthamsetty,
President of Reach Out

Catherine Turner, Com-
munity Service Coordinator

A choir commitment

To the editors,

In light of the recent
controversy regarding the
unfortunate rescheduling of
Fall Convocation, I would
like to acknowledge publicly
the 60 students who are
members of the Davidson
College Concert Choir for
their willingness to perform
at Convocation as is their
custom. ;

They knew that almost
none of their classmates
would attend the event so as

to get an early start on Fall
Break. Yet each singer put
personal feelings aside for
the greater good of the en-
semble—their commitment
to each other came first.

This display of commit-
ment was due in no small
part to the leadership pro-
vided by the choir’s thirteen
seniors, all of whom were in
attendance.

Thus, I salute my entire
choir, and especially my se-
niors—Jin Chang, Amanda

Davis, Elizabeth dePrater,
Melinda Fritz, Emily
Giacomini, Nicole Howard,
Beth Lindsey, Liz Lockett,
John Patterson, Christine
Roberts, Darrell Smith, Josh
Wood, and Scarlet Wynns—
for a job splendidly done. I
am very proud of you.

Sincerely,

Donna M. Di Grazia
Assistant Professor of
Music

To the editors,

Let me set the scene:
nine months of planning,
“the biggest crowd in the
middle of Patterson Court
since The Dave Matthews
Band’s performance in
1993” (which is debatable),
and a poor reporting job on
the part of The Davidsonian.
Yes, I’m talking about Otis
Day and the Knights! “The
$10,000 band of 95” (which*

is grossly inaccurate) was
sponsored by Phi Delta
Theta, Connor, Black Stu-
dent Coalition, Rusk, and
Warner Hall, but nobody
from any of these houses
was interviewed by The
Davidsonian for the Octo-
ber 2nd “Otis lives on!” ar-
ticle. I’msure that any-of the
toga-wearing Phi Delts in
The Davidsonian ‘s picture
of Otis would have been

more than happy to com-
ment on their efforts to bring
Otis to Davidson. They
could have told any
Davidsonian writer inter-
esting facts such as all of the
Knights are new since the
movie, even though some of
them have played with Otis
for 12 and 13 years, or that
the band does over 200
