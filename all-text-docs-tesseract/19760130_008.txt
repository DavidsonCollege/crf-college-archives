The Dance of the Deer is the feature
perfomance of the National Dance
Company of Mexico. It was perfomed
Wednesday, January 21 in Love
Auditorium early in the program.

The audience was first stimulated
with whirling colors and lively song
by twenty-two dancers and fourteen
musicians.

The Dance of the Deer is one of
Mexico’s oldest national dances. Jen-
aro Torres has but fifteen minutes to
prepare himself backstage for the part
of the deer, though he spent a year
studying the part under a master in
Mexico City.

Ona half-lit stage this deer runs
out and circles. There are rattles in his
hands and antlers on his head. His
torso is bare. He stops quickly to
listen. He steps and stops again.
Alert to something his head tilts
listening. His breast swells and
quivers. All else remains still. Then
off he runs again, loping and rattling.

Marimba music intensifies as the
hunt proceeds. Two hunters enter,
stalk the deer, then leave. They come
again with bows.

The music is loud, intense. The deer
stops and starts. His body feels the
danger. His chest convulses in fear.
He cringes and sprawls as the arrows
find him amid violent music and
noise.

COLORFUL COSTUMES high-
lighted Mexican performance.

” exibits color, not finesse

Then all sound ceases.

He struggles against his death. His
body contorts in spasms. He falls and
rises in the silence. He shakes,
collapses, and is still.

Another act of sufficient note was a
lariet twirling display by a golden-
haired virtuoso clad in black cowboy
dress. His double shadow cast on the
back wall was fascinating to watch.
His most spectacular display was a
sort of jump-rope perfomed in a
squatting position--he jumped into
the middle of the hoop as it shot back
and forth from the right to the left.

The rope act drew the greatest
applause from the Davidson audience.

The dance numbers featuring the
entire troupe are most memorable for
the colorful costuming. Synchroniza-
tion of step was very often lacking in
the more complex numbers, and
other, more simple numbers were
somewhat uneventful. The ‘‘Zan-
dunga’”’ was a notable exception,
sparkling with delicacy and slow
precision.

The ‘‘Rueblan Dance’’ was a de-
light. In it Nahuatt Indians worship
the god of flowers. They dance a
maypole routine with pink ribbons
attached to a flower-topped pole.

And very rousing was the finale in
which eighteen dancers did a clog-
ging-like routine in unison. Also
during this dance two lovers tie a bow
in a long red ribbon using only their
feet.

OOOPS....

The musical features were some-
times quite pleasing. Such was the
marimba duet. Other performances
were marred by a crude unprofession-
alism. Most of the beauty of the
Spanish lyrics was lost on the
Davidson audience. Though one vo-
calist was exceptionally fine and could
have been enjoyed singing gibberish.

audience.

FAST FEET stimulate Davidson

The performers themselves admit-
ted after the show that their perform-
ance had not been up to par. They
attributed its faults to their tardiness
(they arrived at 7:45 pm for an 8:15
performance), and to weariness after
20 hours on the road (they had come
from above Chicago). Also the stage

and backstage area were rather small

Annual “January Blues” deluge the deluded

By CATHY LANDIS and

Have you failed three reviews in three
days?

Do you have a:. paper due yesterday,
2 reviews tomorrow, and a lab
practical today?

Have your ears become painfully
attatched to the language lab ear-
phones?

Was the sum of your registration
numbers higher than your board

scores?

Was Wet Willie the best time you’ve

had since New Year’s Eve?

Did you celebrate Bo Brickles’ 11th
career victory?

Is The Davidsonian the most interest-
ing thing you’ve read this week?

Do you find razor blades and 4th Belk
windows unusually inviting?

Are your feet wet?
Is your entire body wet?

An affirmative answer to each
question is worth 1 point. If you score
8 or lower, transfer. You are abnor-
mal. If you score 9 or 10 you have
three options: A drunken revelry,

suicide, or stoicism.

Ouce again Davidson drowns in the

rain and tears of its own self-pity; it
sinks in to ‘‘The January Blues.’’ The
halls transform into silent tombs that
hold legions of numb, sleep-craved,
book-drugged, and library-condition-
ed zombies.
__ Even Frontis Johnston has nothing
more to say than, ‘‘we had a good
college before the Davidson National
and we'll have a good College without
it.

Every winter January hits
Davidson College harder than the
rains. No matter what the causes, the
condition need not be incurable. Make
Davidson an umbrella.

Seriously, the ‘‘January depres-

sion’’ will not last. It will transform
into the “‘February depression’’ which
will climax dramatically with exams.
But time, “‘the great healer,’”’ always
manages to carry Davidson to spring,
and the campus awakens once again.

“January Blues’ are all-pervasive
at Davidson; they are contagious.
Everyone recognizes them, so there is
no need to get depressed about them.

Just think of January as the
cathartic experience necessary for the
full enjoyment of spring. They can be
cured; students can stop threatening
to transfer and teachers to resign.
They are not going to anyway as soon
as spring arrives. In the meantime,
both the 900 room and the library are
open until 1:00. Take your pick.
