THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1997

Like most Davidson students,
at this time last year I was begin-
ning to look for something to do
during the summer. Little did I
realize that the internship I would
end up with would help shape my
career goals, change my under-
standing of what service means,
and offer a good stipend as well!
It started when I noticed a flyer
one day in Watts. What caught my
eye were the words “Urban Ser-
vice Internship.” It sounded like a
unique opportunity—a ten week
internship at one of several ser-
vice agencies in Charlotte. Spon-
sored by Davidson College and
two Presbyterian churches in Char-
lotte, the program combines Chris-
tian faith and urban service, giv-
ing participants a chance to reflect
both on the needs of urban com-
munities and the Christian re-
sponse to them.

I never expected to be se-
lected as one of the four Stapleton-
Davidson interns, and I was un-
prepared for how much I would
enjoy the summer. One of the best
things about the program is that

your interests to place you at an
agency whose needs best suit you.
All kinds of opportunities exist in
the Stapleton-Davidson program,
like counselors at summer day
camps for disadvantaged kids, po-

the process of creating a publica-
tion. I became familiar with pub-
lishing software and had the expe-
rience of negotiating and working
with a publisher.

I learned also about the way
that a nonprofit works—its finan-

had skills in business and manage-
ment, marketing, computers, and
community relations, just to name
a few. All of these people were
committed to helping kids and
families, and had found a way to
perform such service while simply

sitions with Crisis Assis-
tance Ministries, and
working with the home-
less at the Charlotte Ur-
ban Ministry Center. In
my case, the match
couldn’t have been better.
I worked at Family Cen-
ter, a nonprofit agency
whose inission is to pre-
vent and treat child abuse
and neglect. One of my
biggest discoveries that

doing what they enjoyed.
In addition to the “work”
side of the summer, all
four interns were warmly
welcomed by the host
churches. One of the
churches gave us free
memberships to their
recreation center, which
was complete with an in-
door track and weight
room. We were invited
each week to dinner at

summer was that service doesn’t

‘necessarily mean dishing up food

at a soup kitchen, but rather find-
ing a way to use your own gifts to
serve others. In my case, Family
Center gave me the responsibility
of writing and publishing its an-
nual newsletter. Not only did I
learn all about the agency during
that project, but lalso learned about

cial operations and strategies for
cultivating good relationships with
its donors and the public. Most
importantly, my understanding of
“service” changed significantly.
Family Center, for example, is a
nonprofit service agency, but it is
also a business well-run by edu-
cated professionals. The agency
benefitted from employees who

the home of different members,
and were the special guests at pic-
nics and barbecues. The people at
the church and at my agency could
not have been more wonderful; I
still keep in touch with several of
the friends that I made at Family
Center and First Presbyterian last
summer.

I hope to encourage anyone

even slightly interested in the
Stapleton-Davidson internship to
apply. Until last summer, I’d never
had a job where I didn’t watch the
clock for quitting time to roll
around. The program changed my
attitudes about service, and showed
me the kind of profession that I
wantto pursue. At Davidson think
it’s easy to forget that the rest of the
world doesn’t live in a pleasant
maze of red brick buildings sur-
rounded by well-kept lawns. Ac-
tually seeing and working with
children and families who were
experiencing the pain of abuse
and neglect made those problems
all the more real to me. I’d read
about the statistics; but the real
faces of Family Center’s clients
made me even more convinced of
the need for the kind of service I
was engaged in.

If you want to know more,
brochures are available from the
Chaplain’s office in the Union,
and applications are due on Febru-
ary 7. It’s a wonderful internship
program. If you’re interested, give
it a shot.

Coming back to Davidson
after a semester off is an adjust-
ment whether you went to Spain,
to India, to France or even just to
a different school. One of my
friends got the feeling right when
he said, “When I pulled off onto
the exit I just wanted to do the
complete circle and get right back
on the highway.”

' Actually, my first week back
wasn’tthat strange because all of
my friends were here. But, a lot
of my friends are going/have gone
abroad again for the second se-
mester and that’s made things
very strange. In fact, Itook one of
my best friends to the airport on
Saturday. She’s on her way to
Rome, and I’m looking forward
to another exciting semester here.

We both cried — that reeks
so strongly of Anne of Green
Gables or Little House on the
Prairie that I almost can’t write
it, but it’s the truth. I cried be-
cause I was being left behind and
she cried because I was going to
be here without her.

The whole day had a surreal
feeling — after I dropped her off
I couldn’t go back to Davidson
just yet so I roped my friend into
going to the movies with me. We
got back at about 6 p.m. The
worst timing ever if you haven’t
already made plans. The friend
I went to the movies with has a
boyfriend so she was covered but
I, alas, do not and was panicking
— What am I going to do? Who
am I going to call?

I’d talked to one of my more
random buddies earlier in the day,
and she’d asked me if I were
going to the Taj for the “We Are
the World” party. [had this flash

Fitting into Home

- about a half hour feeling sorry for

happy as I was to get away —I’m

of fear — “I can’t go there — I
won’tknow anybody!” Idefinitely
didn’t think I would fit in. She
told me that if I didn’t want to go
there she’d see me at PiKA later
on — another stab of fear as I
thought, “Do I know anyone in
PiKA?” Like it matters.

Ihung up with her and sat for

myself until I realized that things
were going to be different this
semester, there was no point in
putting off the inevitable.

So, I called them back and
said I’d see them at the Taj. I
ended up having an awesome time
— Iknew a surprising number of
people and trust me, its highly
unlikely that someone could NOT
fit in there. I saw the best impres-
sion of Tina Turner since Angela
Bassett, and I was able to beef up
my “We Are the World” trivia.

Then we were off to PiKA —
everyone I went with was 21 so
they went down into the basement
and I was left solo for a while. My
nightmare had come true, but
shocker, of course I knew a ton of
people there and so I walked
around catching up — occasion-
ally just hanging out. In short, I
had a great time.

Being back at Davidson is
strange. They say there’s a two
week adjustment period and I’ ve
had one week. I’m definitely go-
ing to miss Spain — easy classes,
going out every night — espe-
cially when the weekend’s over
and because I’ve already been
caught not having my accounting
homework done.

But I love Davidson, and as

happy to be back. .

Swinging to Safety

In addition to recently saying
“good-bye” to 1996, Davidson
College has alsorecently said good-
bye to what was a major fixture of
Davidson Academic life — the
Chambers doors.

Old, heavy, and unwieldy, the
swinging doors on Chambers were
a challenge at best and dangerous
at worst, especially if you were
trying to finish your reading for
your next class or are generally
oblivious like I am.

For years the combination of
free hinges and the laws of physics
have made navigating one’s way
to class reminiscent of one of those
trap-evasion sequences in an [ndi-
ana Jones movie. -

Perhaps it is just me, but often
I have found myself running to
class, feet from the door which has
just been pushed vigorously open
by someone in a greater hurry than
I. Faced with the choice of either
accelerating to’ make it through,
(and risking collision with aschool-
mate) or slowing down and wait-
ing for the doors to loose their
momentum in the forward swing,
often I have judged wrongly, and
either wasted precious seconds of
travel time, or received a thwack-
ing from the massive bars when
the door proved faster than I.

Understandably, I shed few
tears when the school’s Physical
Plant decided last year that the
Chambers doors were rotting and
needed replacement. The Physical
Plant had to evaluate which doors
were still on the market, material
longevity, and accessibility stan-
dards mandated by the Americans
with Disabilities Act. They chose
the current design: light-weight,
automatically opening (when the
system is complete) and less likely

to hit anyone.

Some traditionalists don’tlike
the change and are nostalgic for
the old doors which made Cham-
bers hard to secure at night. Good
or bad, one group of students has
capitalized on Physical Plant’s
changing of doors and has tackled
the issue of student safety.

The Student Advisory Com-
mittee to the Director of Campus
Safety took the opportunity of the
door-change last year to insist that
any adjustments to Chambers in-

clude a security system. The sys-.

tem, a result of almost a year of
discussion of student concerns and
careful shopping, will be opera-
tional in a few weeks’ time and
will greatly improve the security
of students studying in Chambers
at night.

When operational, the system
will electro-magnetically lock all
the Chambers doors from 6 p.m. to
6 a.m. Each side of the building

ers identical to the ones on dormi-
tories; a fire alarm will also be able
to open every door simultaneously
in case of danger.

Lucian Dervan, the chair of
the committee and author of the
SGA resolution that called for the
security system, cited an incident
last year involving a student study-
ing late at night in Chambers and
an individual who was not a
Davidson student.

Ofcourse everyone knows that
one incident is one too many, but
the added security and continued
student vigilance hopefully will
make Chambers the ideal place for
quiet, late-night studying.

People may disagree on the
fate of the swinging doors, but
everyone should agree that their -
passage has allowed another vital
safety improvement to our already
near-ideal campus.

Kudos to the Advisory com-
mittee to the Director of Campus
