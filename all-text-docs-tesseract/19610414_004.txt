eous. responsive, and _ intelli-

Alumnus Gives Library
Shakespeare Volumes

By TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Sixteen volumes containing the works of William
Shakespeare and the original novels and tales on which
the plays are founded have the smell and dust of the very

old as they lie on the shelf in

the cage of the library. The

volumes are very large; their total weight is almost 200

pounds.

Only an expert on rare books
could tell that these musty, old
volumes are valued for the
monetary sum of between four
and five thousand dollars. Dr.

C. G. Davidson, director of the
library, believes that the set is
“the most valuable single ac
quisition since the library ac
quired the French Encyclopedie
back before 1860.”

The complete set of the first
edition of the Holliwell-Philips
Works of Shakespeare will make
an important addition to the
collection of books that will go
into the proposed Treasure
Room of the library. The set
was published in London in the
mid-1800’s and is very rare.

Davidson College can thank
an alumnus, Dr. Charles B.
Sanders of the Class of 1922,
for these books. Dr. Sanders
said he first became acquaint-
ed with the set several years
ago and at that time deter-
mined to give it to the col-
lege that had done so much
for him, if he ever got the
chance.

In giving the books, Dr. San-

|ders is also paying tribute to

Leander: Sin, Suicide
Not Sweden's Problem

BY PER LEANDER
Richardson Scholar

(Editor’s Note: This is the last in a series of articles by Richardson Scholars about
customs and characteristics of their homelands, or on their. impressions of Davidson.)

_. The television program last Sunday in the “20th Century” series dealing
with the Swedish Welfare State was fairly accurate, but parts of the program
were presented in such a fragmentary manner as to distort truth.

We were introduced to a
typical middle-class family with
an annual income of $6200. This
figure does not sound very im-
pressive, but I dare say that this
family should enjoy a standard
of living equal to that of an
American $9000 a year family.

There are three reasons.
Most important, many prices
are tower in Sweden. For ex-
ample, e good meal would cost
about 60 or 70 cents, Secondly,
much of the money for the
sociel welfere program is paid
by the firms to the state di-
rectly. The benefits decrease
family expenditures by $200-
$400 @ year.

Thirdly, the public transporta-
tion facilities have deteriorated
in the United States. (Only Man-
hattan’s facilities are compan
able to the Swedish ones, as I
should know after traveling in
18 of these states.)

The Swedish family does not
| Teally need a car. And to man-
age without a car would for an
| American family be the same as
‘a raise by $1000 a year, wouldn’t

the United States. The juvenile
delinquency rate is lower in
Sweden than in the United
States. The same is true about
alcoholism; Sweden has 2,580
alcholics for 10,000 adults while
the United States has 4,390.

There are more recognized
suicides in Sweden. But Sweden
has not the highest rate. Accord,
ing to statistics, there are in

with higher suicide rates.

there will not be another rock
