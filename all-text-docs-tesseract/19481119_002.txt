Editor Dave Gambrel and his Seripts 'N
Pranks staff have just preseuted the cétpns
with what looks like one of the best tssues
of the ifagazine that has appeared in some
time. They are to be congratulated on their
wide range of subject matter well handled
and entertainingly expounded upon. They
seem to have achieved a fairly even balaice
between humor and serious literary endeavor
—an achievement which friend_tMeatbidil”
lists in his Editor’s Notes as the magazine's
goal.

Interesting articles treat subjects rang:
ing from the blocking assighinent of the tail
back on a weak-side off-tavkle reverse to the
tonsil quality of the strings in Meunch’s
cording of Saint Saens, Symphony nniher
three—from helpful hints on mowing. lawns
to inside dope presidential biography. The
magazine staff, and especially writers Don
Shriver, Sam Robinson, Bill Brownson, Boh
Hollister and Dave Hamiltou, are to be con-*
“gratulated on the goodscreative works that
bear their ‘‘by-lines.”’

Since the. clectioW there has been

a ee ' . . ail
much speculation as to what it
meant, but this questioning of the

outcome has confined itseh to the
political Side iit STOTT Toth vores
and their present, personal reasons
for voting as they did. In this arti-
cle we shall try to uncover the one
basic philosophical reasun for the
outcome.

To. do'this we shall have to take
ourselves back to 1932 and the elec-
tion which put--Koosevelt—into the
presidency, Roosevell was elected
to this office not once, but four
times, because he was able to make
himself all things to all peosile. tHe
persuaded a great niass of the peo-
ple to believe in the idaw that some-
thing could be had for nothing,
that freedom could be had without
its -comsequent responsibility, To
perform this feat he had 10 put inte
effect a great. robbing of Peter te
pay aul, and once eiobarked on
this course, it was dmipassible for
him to turn back, The-second world
war happened along most propitious:
ly in that it gave the unstable econ-
omy he was creating new life and
made it appear that his ideas of
economics would indeed usher in the
golden age of prosperity in Alneri-
ca. Both economically aud philoso.
phically, howe ever, we “were swing-
tow the left throughout those
years. Any economist
that freedom without responpibility
or *something_for nothing_can onty
be had under the economic system
which is embodied in socialisin or,
more drastically, in communism.
Thew can also tell you that stich a
system cannot but produce in those
living under it a weakening and an

ultimate destruction of moralgQber

and intellectual integrity.

So insidious was the change, how-
ever, that the people absorbed this
philosophy without themselyes re-
alizing it. To be more specific, the
slow advent of tore, and more 'gov-
ernmental control aid concentra-
tion of power, seemed always to be
for the greatest good at the ‘time,

but unwittingly, we were swinging

left and doing so without the u
nial countér-swing to the right, Now
if socialism be our aim, then 4 swing
to the left is to -be expected—Put

achieving this end.

td the economic system. Consequent-
ly, through a graduflly tightening
system of injurious taxation and
control of business, the accumula-
ton-ot-—#—national—debt~conipletely
incomprehensible in its enormity,
and a government increasingly dom-
inated by labor interests, we have
béen ‘heading, certainly, toward so-
ciilism, but we have also been
heading toward ultimate economic
chaos.

Once having made this statement,
we must prove our point. Truman
und present adniinistration, as the in-
heritors of Roosevelt’s economic and
poitical philosophy of hand in glove
co-operation with labor, can do noth-
ing more
cr amounts of leftist legislation.
Labor helped him get where he is
today and naturally expects a re-
turn, in the form of favorable legis-
lation. Now let us examine this pro-
posed legislation and see why it is
both socialistic and completely coun-
ter to achieving socialisin with econ-
omic safety.

Truman wants a higher minimum
wage, How can you give labor a
higher minimum wage without in-
creasing the price of consumer pro-
ducts turned out by manufacturers

Who will they tax? We don't have
