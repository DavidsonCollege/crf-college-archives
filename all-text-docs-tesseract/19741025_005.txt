college’s ‘position. He stated
that these are decisions ‘for
the girls to make” and should
be regarded as private
decisions between patient and

In response to student,

criticism of Southern Bell
Telephone Company and to
the present phone system at
Davidson College, several ac-
tions have been taken.

The Grievance Committee
of the Student .Government
Association has begun a study
of the telephone situation.

The college administration
has begun a three month study
of the present phone system
and ofthe possible installation
of a centrex telephone system.

, Also, a telephone question-
naire was distributed to all
dorm rooms on campus. Ap-
proximately half of all dorm
rooms on campus turned in
completed questionnaires.

The remaining rie —
were inspected to find ou
they contained phones. In
these rooms with phones the
additional information of. type

of phone and whether the -‘

tors Jerome Howard, Kerec-
man, and Donatelli have
strongly. suggested that
students seeking other
medical attention contact
them through their regular of-
fices.

Karl Goodhouse, a
sophomiore who has done ex-
tensive research on human
sexuality, organizing the
recent sexuality symposium
on campus, sympathizes with
the infirmary’s position, but
feels more work and study is
needed in this area.

‘We should really give the
infirmary credit; they’re
making do with what they
have, which isn’t much. I

agree that the argument that .

we’re not a general hospital is
a good one, but, we do need
some sort of preventive
medicine.

“It’s about time for people

to sit down and think about ex-

service
really

panding health
programs--we’re.

- behind the times,’’ Goodhouse

continued.

“T would like to see a cam-
pus resource center providing
information on different
programs and centers for

—not just on human
sexuality, but also drugs,
guidance, and other
that might arise--to tell
students about every
available service to take care
of needs that the college
doesn’t take care of.’’

Both Goodhouse and
Assistant Dean of Students
Diane Stone are
by nearby clinics that do
provide women’s health ser-
vices and contraceptive coun-

seling.
, The Huntersville Family

Planning Clinic, located
behind Huntersville Hospital
on! ‘Highway 115, offers free
women’s health services and
contraceptive counseling to
anyone 18 or older.

Operating Thursdays from
1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m., their.
services include an

may be made at 875-2523.
Stone is enthusiastic about
this program. “‘It’s great
because of the time element—
that’s what it’s there for, and
it’s relatively qlose.””
Another clinic, the
Mocresville Women’s Clinic,
offers extensive private health
services, although these °

To Examine Centrex

phone had a long cord was
recorded.

In the computation of the
questionnaires, it was found
that there are approximately
185 dorm rooms with phones
while approximately 355
rooms do not have phones.

There are long cords on 78
of the phones. There are ap-
proximately 15 table phones
and approximately 170 wall
phones.

When asked if the student
received exactly. the phone
type, phone color, and correct
attachments ordered, 25
percent of the students re-
plied negatively.

Many students revealed that
when they tried to get their
original order installed after
the wrong phone was _ in-
stalled, they were told that
they would have to pay rein-
stallationcharges. —

When asked to rate the ser-
vice thus far in dealings with
Southern Bell, 20; percent of

the students with phones an-

. Swered poor, 27 percent an-

swered fair, 44 percent an-
swered good, and nine percent
answered excellent.

The telephone questionnaire
also asked both roommates,
regardless of whether or not
their room had a phone, if they
favor a_ voluntary . centrex
telephone system.

The centrex system looks
like the present phone system
in outward appearance.
However, under the centrex
system, Southern Bell would
assess the college for the en-
tire system, and the college
thus would become the billing
agency for the telephone ser-
vice.

Southern Bell still would bill
the student for any long
distance calls made.

Students would not have to
worry about installation since
phones would remain installed
in the dorm rooms all year and

_just would be switched on if

phone service is desired.
There probably also would

be some monetary savings to

the Davidson student under

the centrex system as opposed .

to the present installation and
billing system.

In response to the voluntary
centrex system. where the
student could decide if he or
she wants phone service, an
overwhelming 98 percent of
the students answered yes.

In calls made to Winthrop,

from these schools spoke quite
favorably of the centrex
system.

question on the telephone sur-
vey which asked for any fur-
