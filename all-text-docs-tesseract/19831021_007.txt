From The Green Room,

By TIM WAPLES

After three weeks of no-holds-bar-
red, thumb-to-thumb combat, visions of
tournament time are dancing in many
eager players’ heads. Denizens of thc
Union witness the ever-increasing pil:
grimages to the College Bowl Corner to
check the standings. Innocent bystanders
are bombarded with questions absolutely
unintelligible to civilians: Is Whiplash
really any good? What’s the game to
watch at 7:30? Can we beat the Buzz Al-
drins? Just who the heck are those Thun-
dering Amoebi? My personal favorite is:
Which one is Peking Man? They all look
like Cro-Magnons to me.

This week you’ll get a little help from
the Green Room. We’ll give you a quick
and sloppy run-down on all four divi-
sional races as they’re beginning to shape
up. We suggest that those civilians not

yet introduced to The Magic of College
Bowl pick a suitable dark horse and fol-
low their progress. You may find your-
self behind a buzzer before you know it.

In the American League East, a
three-horse race is evident. Number 3
Whiplash and number 6 Peking Man and
the Cro-Magnons are galloping side-by-
side at 2-0, while number 9 Rubber
Babies are just a length behind at 1-1. Al-
though Gracefully Risque is 1-2 and
probably not in contention, they’re tough
enough to spoil Rubber Babies’ com-
eback hopes. Good Buzz, lurking in the
shadows at 1-1, may not have the fire-
power to make a strong bid, although
their name ought to be worth at least forty
points a game.

In the AL West, number 2 Fourth Es-
tate and number 8 I Phelta Thi are head-
to-head at 2-0. The Fresh Men and the

Segment 3: Crunchtime

Brainless Wonders are in the running at
-1, but these Class of ’87 hotshots will
have to wait for their day in the sun.
Perhaps the two hottest teams in the
game today are number | Buzz Aldrins
and number 7 Pisces, both of the NL
East. Together they have amassed 970
points while chalking up four victories
for an average of over 240 points per
game. Although number 10 Madd Mudd
is tough enough to go the distance in
some divisions, they’ll be left out of the
playoffs unless they can upset Buzz later
this year. Tied at 1-2, Jed P. and the In-
spirations and Apocalyptic Hope join the

Fresh Men and the Wonders as Teams of .

the Future.

As always, the NL West is a real dog-
fight. Although number 5 Egomaniac
and the Yes Men have shocked the Green
Room by jumping off to a 3-0 record,

—— Music

By STEPHEN MANK

Any band with a name like Aztec
Camera has to be cool. It’s like Smuc-
kers, right? Chances are they wear
funny glasses, play guitars shaped like
lightning bolts, and sing about love in
the hardware store.

Actually, Aztec Camera is as far
from what it should be as it could be.
Instead of exuding an image of fun-
loving coolness, the group more re-
sembles four Rudolph Valentinos
suavely wooing some comely breath of
spring.

The debut album High Land, Hard
Rain is a collection of sophisticated
romantic ballads with an element of
good old fashioned schmaltz. The
music is well written, the lyrics are in-
telligent and witty, the playing is pre-
cise, and the vocals are controlled and
pleasant. All the qualities for a great
group and debut are there.

The only problem is that some
people may find it difficult to wade
through the soft soap and Las Vegas
slickness in order to get to the sub-
stance beneath.

Aztec Camera: Smuckers And Schmaitz

The opening cut,
exuberantly

“Oblivious,”
combinates acoustic

guitar, bass, and drums against a dron-
ing layer of organ. After the first listen
one will recognize a little bit of the
style of Elvis Costello. This is no coin-
cidence. Costello has been a supporter

and mentor to the band, even having
them open for him on his last tour.
“Release,” one of the better songs
on the disc, resembles the soft jazz you
hear at fashion shows. Guitarist/voc-
alist Roddy Frame, sounding very
much like a combination of Joe Pis-

play their instruments as badly as ever,

copo and Frank Sinatra, croons of
silver rooftops, Keats, and magic. The
lyrics are actually quite good in spite of
some intentional corniness.

Most people will find Aztec Cam-
era a little old hat, but for those who
swoon to the likes of Spandau Ballet or
ABC this album represents a welcome
new breed, who have, of all things, tal-
ent.

Quick Pan

If Kiss had any appealing qualities
before, they've certainly done a tidy
job of eliminating them on their latest
L.P., Lick It Up. This is the album on
which they reveal themselves, not only
by taking off their make-up but by
writing some of the worst songs ever.
The lyrics have taken on a nasty tone,
with shades of Hell, lust, drugs, sado-
masochism, and psychopathy. They

even though two of the original mem-
bers have (understandably) quit the
group. In short, there is no possible
way this album can be enjoyed—un-
less, of course, you happen to be roller
skating on a Friday night.

they have yet to feel the wrath of number
4 Better Luck Next Year. BLNY, Thun-
dering Amoebi, Les Miserables, and Les
Idiots Savants are all firmly in conten-
tion, but none of these teams can afford a
false step in their final games. Although
it’s really anybody’s race right now, look
for experience to make the difference.
Put your money on BLNY and
Egomaniac, but you better ask for odds.

In action-last Monday, the Buzz Al-
drins induced Apocalyptic Despair 305-
55 count. Whiplash squeezed out a 195-
165 victory in the last minute over a
tough Rubber Babies team. Pisces
proved they are for real with an impres-
sive 250-180 victory over Madd Mudd.
Jed P. finally got on track, scoring a big
230 points in their win over The Blehc.
Good Buzz nipped the Necrophiliacs,
while Fourth Estate, Peking Man, and
Egomaniac all coasted to victories.

In his playing debut, Steve Hughes
led I Phelta Thi to a resounding 200-55
win over the Fresh Men. Undaunted by
national media attention, Steve opened
the game with a stylish interrupt to pace
teammates Loper, King, and Graves. Al-
though he’s proved himself to be a truc
Renaissance man, the upcoming weeks
will be tough as he tries to shoulder the
superhuman burden of both coaching and
playing. Stay tuned for further develop-
ments.

I’m afraid we’ve got ‘bad 1 news for all
you College Bow] junkies out there. Due
to pressure from the United Nations,
matches for Monday have been canceled
to permit the thousands of fans to flock
from the Union to Love Auditorium. The
Artists Series is presenting Frula, a
Yugoslav dance troupe. The Green
Room advises that teams go to get some
culture, or at least to be ready for Eastern
European boogie questions. Matches
will return a week later on Halloween.
Although the College Bowl Corner
won't be updated, be sure to check here
for more fun next week. Next Friday’s
column will provide the information the
whole campus has been waiting for: just
who are those guys in the Green Room?
It’s true — the Pulitzer winnning varsity
team expose is just a week away. Don’!
miss it.
