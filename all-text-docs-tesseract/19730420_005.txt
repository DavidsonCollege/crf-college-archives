Rabil Clarifies Drug Criticism,
Wilson Accused Of Burneyism

To the Editor:

Last week I wrote a criticism
of Andy Lamas’ study of phar-
macy. Let me set a few things
straight in regard to my letter.

That criticism was written
primarily about the portions of
Lamas’ study which related to
independent interests. His
study actually encompassed
many aspects of pharmacy
such as national drug lobbies.
illegal practices, pharmacy in
other states, and other areas.

The information he gave
regarding these areas I believe
is accurate and factual.

In my letter I intended to give
what I thought were additional
facts regarding pharmacy in
North Carolina, specifically
about independent pharmacies.
the State Board, and the Code of
Ethics.

In light of these things. I must
clarify and correct a few
statements.

Andy did not actually say that
pharmacy students could not do
internships in chains. He just
said that special interests
prevented this. But it is still
legal in N.C

I said independent <stgres do
not clear that uch more profit
than chain. stores. My idea of
tnat much more is not the same
as Andy's. But it is true. In-
dependent stores for the most
part do clear more profit than
chains.

Andy was able to demon-
strate a several thousand per-
cent mark-up.

Later on I learned that Andy
did study a full range of drugs,
but I didn’t understand this
from the article.

My family has several in-
dependent drug stores, and I
know for a fact that these in-
dependent pharmacies offer
more services than chains. I
believe these services such as
delivery, family drug profile
charts, and the continuing
education courses attended bh
our pharmacist; justify the
prices they charge.

To the Editor:

In the Scriptures we read of
one man’s opinion of Paul:
“Thy great learning hast made
thee mad!"’

I find this phrase all too ap-
plicable. when used slightly out
of context. to staff writer Gray
Wilson; a columnist who at one
time appeared to be a pensive
spokesman of rational student
views (contra Cecil Burney).
Mr. Wilson has over the course
of the year succumbed to the
temptations of Burneyism and
has allowed his analytic ap-
proach to issues to be replaced
by flaming rhetoric. jejune
phraseology. and _ crude
manifestations of the more
acrimonious facet of his per-
sonality (a facet which for-
tunately remains unpublished
for the majority of us).

While in the past his ravings
have been inconsequential in
nature and thus unworthy of
response. his last article on
public motor vehicle safety was
objectionable to at least one

reader.

As an assistant working in the
emergency room at a Charlotte
hospital. I have seen such in-
fantile expressions of abandon
as found in Mr. Wilson's article
realized in the form of broken
bones. cruel lacerations. and
pain in the eyes of the victims of
motor accidents.

Believe it or not, I think most
of these people, when pondering
retrospectively, may very well
decide that their moments of
Wilsonian escape were not of
sufficient value to justify their
present agony.

In my own opinion as one who
daily travels on a ‘tombstone
on wheels’’. I would not care to
entrust my  unarmoured
cranium to the inconsiderate
boors that frequent the area's
roads.

These people need every
safety device possible. even
those which ignite the flamings
of Mr. Wilson.

Boycott On Martin

By E. F. Patterson
Professor of Economics

Page Five

The appearance of the Honorable James G. Martin. member of
Congress from the North Carolina Ninth Congressional District. as
a Spring Convocation speaker will turn an academic or educational
affair into a political event. The very nature of his position makes
the occasion an exercise in political action. even if all he does is to
recite nursery rhymes.

It is impossible for the President. or a member of Congress. to
make a “non-political” speech or appearance. and to argue other-
wise Is fatuous and spurious reasoning.

The form of government established by the Constitution and its
Amendments is democracy. The unique feature of democracy that
distinguishes it from other forms of government is that in a
democracy the governors and the governed are identical.

It is this fact that led Victor Gollanz to state, correctly. that
“anything done officially in a democratic country is done in your
name. because unless vou protest. it is as if you were doing it in
your own person.”

It follows, then, that in a democracy one is obligated to take
every opportunity that presents itself to influence public policy in
the direction which he believes is in the best interest of society.

I shall. therefore. boycott the Spring Convocation to protest
against the political philosophy of Congressman Martin and
against the positions he has taken on the economic. political. and
social issues that face the country

To cite a few examples of positions with which I strongly
disagree. He was ambivalent. to say the least. on the matter of
busing to achieve integration in the public schools.

He has from the beginning consistently supported United States
involvement in the Indochina War and continues to support the war
policies of the Nixon Administration. He supports the current
‘*soak-the-poor’’ budget of Nixon.

He recently made a speech in the House on the federal budget
that revealed considerable ignorance even of the simplest elements
of modern economic theory.

He voted to continue the House Committee on Internal Security
(formerly the House UnAmerican Activities Committee) although,
as any reasonably informed person knows. this committee has con-
sistently and regularly violated the fundamental principles of
freedom of thought and of justice. ;

I do not protest against Congressman Martin appearing. I would.
and do, defend his right, which I would upgrade ‘to obligation, to
seek and take every opportunity to enhance his reputation and to
promote his philosophy and his policies on economic. political, and
social issues.

I have an equal right. even obligation. to take every chance to
diminish his reputation and to thwart his policies in these areas.

There are those who will say that my action is impolite and ill-
mannered. Most political action activities are impolite, even,
repulsive, to those who are of the opposite opinion.

I think Glen Ford. a supporter of Nixon and of United States in-
volvement in Vietnam, was downright dedecorous when he ‘‘took

. the occasion of a reception in Australia to let high-ranking Aussie

officials know what he thought about their government's
criticism of President Nixon and his handling of the Vietnam W2; *:
(CHARLOTTE OBSERVER, April 7, 1973)

There are those who will say that my gestur< js meaningless and
even counter-productive. and they ma‘, pe right.

1 am willing to argue about t\e efficacy of specific political action
tactics. but not abou! ‘ne principle of and the necessity for political
action. €sPeTjally in a democracy.

*unough I urge others to take the same or similar action, I do not
mean to criticize. even by implication, anyone who does not.

I follow the tune of my own drummer. and I cannot. in good con-

science, recommend this tune to anyone else or condemn anyone
who does not ‘step to this music.’
