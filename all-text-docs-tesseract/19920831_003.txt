Beginning this semester,
Davidson Auxiliary Services will
use a new “Bonus Bucks” dining
system. ,

Under the new plan, stu-
dents receive an up-front sum on
their declining balance at the be-
ginning of the semester. These
“Bonus Bucks” can be used any-
time at the Union Cafe, at lunch at
Baker and late nights at the soon-
to-be-open “Union Outpost.” 10-
meal cardholders are given $80 in
“Bonus Bucks”, 14-meal $90 and
19-meal $100.

According to the Cam-
pus Network, “‘Bonus Bucks” will
be “replacing the rather decadent
meal exchange program that re-
quired one to use a contract meal
for purchases at the Union Cafe
and the limited [sic] use of meal
plan to breakfast and lunch.”

Under the old “free-flow
of meals” plan, a student could
either receive a meal at the Com-

mons or $3.60 credit at the Union.

Meals could be exchanged at the

Union only before 4 P.M.
According to Carleton

Pritchard, Director of Auxiliary ’

Services, “one of the problems was
that ‘meals’ that people were con-
suming were basically going in the
form of groceries.” Second, stu-

dents weren’tallowed to use“‘free-
“flow” meals-at-the Union during”

dinner hours. And finally, stu-
dents had to use all $3.60, or the
remaining credit would be “lost.”

Over the summer,
Pritchard contacted-other quality
colleges and universities to exam-
ine meal-plan options. “Bonus
Bucks” had been used by other
colleges with success and was the
most appealing alternative.

Pritchard stressed that the
new “Bonus Bucks” are in a trial
stage, and that the Dining Services
is always open to comments and
suggestions.
