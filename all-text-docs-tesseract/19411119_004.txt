Team Members Give

Viewpoints On Game

Varsity Squad Thinks David-
son Should Win Game
With Ciatdel

Tomorrow at two, thirty o’clock
our team plays its last game of the
season against The Citadel. To
gage the spirit of the team before
the game, a canvas was made of
several of the members of the
varsity squad, and below are state-
ments by them on how they think
the game will turn out.

Marsh—"Citadel hasn't beat us
since before our freshmen year, and
I don't think that this game could
be an exception.”

Taylor—"The team of 1941 is-cer=
tainly due a game, and 1 believe
that this week, Davidson will show
up in the win column.”

Vosburgh—“Our boys look for a
hard game with Citadel Thursday,
but all of them feel confident that
the team will really roll and chalk
up its first win of the season.”

Williams—‘It’s about time
were winning a game, and I’ve got
a hunch it will be this one. It will
be the last game for a good many
men on the squad and I think it will
be a good one.”

Hunt—“Citadel has a good club,
but I’ve a hunch we have a better

we

one. It should be our day Thurs-
day.”
Bethea. — “Davidson has every-

thing to gain and nothing to lose;
so I believe that the team will
come through with a win Thurs-
day.” '

Moorehead—"We will be at our
full strength Thursday for the first
time this year, and I think we are
pretty sure to beat Citadel.. The
morale of the team is the best it
has been all season.”

Bruce—"“We sure are due’ one.
If the breaks come our way, look
out “Bulldogs.”

Spencer—"It’s our last chance to
break into the Win column, and we
should be at full strength; so I
personally am looking forward to
a victory for the Davidson football
team. We've had our share of
bad luck.”

Frederick—‘I think that we have
regained our confidence and should
come through with a win Thursday.

This has been our main trouble
this season.”
Rainey — “Our boys have had

tough breaks all season and have
been working hard to get“in the
win column. Citadel is our last
chance for a win and I think that
we are ready for them.”

lowing: Infantry Drill. Regulations,
Automatic Rifle, Characteristics of
