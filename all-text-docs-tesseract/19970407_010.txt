MONDAY, APRIL 7, 1997

They’ re saying it’s the death of
the arts in Charlotte. Well, maybe,
but the Mecklenburg County Com-
missioners Board has made a pretty
bold statement about their closed-
minded, backwards, bigoted, isola-
tionist point of view. I’m not usu-
ally one to call names, but I’ m feel-
ing some intense frustration.

Last Tuesday night, the County
Commissioners of Mecklenburg
County voted 5-4 to prohibit fund-
ing of the Arts and Science Council
because of the organization’s “pro-
motion” of homosexually-themed
art, such as “Angels in America.”
In their efforts to advocate family
values, the Commissioners sought
to stamp out any type of program
which would undermine those
“wholesome and healthy” and in-
herently Christian standards—
meaning those standards which la-
bel homosexuality as sinful and
therefore wrong.

The basis of the proposal lies in
the fact that taxpayers were sup-
porting the Arts and Science Coun-

cil, and since apparently there are a
lot of taxpayers opposed to art with
homosexual themes, it’s not fair to
use their dollars to patronize those
types of programs. Just to make a
point, what about the taxpayers who
do support plays like “Angels in
America?”

The other issue, which didn’t
occur to anyone until after the pro-

ues are right, yours are wrong, and
therefore we’ re going to cut you off
because we don’t agree with you.
Instead of advocating family values
or Christian morals, the Commis-
sioners have succeeded in pointing
the mighty finger of judgment di-
rectly at homosexuals. They offer
not Christian-based love but a nar-
row-minded, judgmental point of

The problem with the proposal
is that it comes across as incredibly
self-righteous. It’s saying, our val-

view. And if the County ends up
cutting funding fornon-profitagen-
cies which do offer tangible help,
I'll be sorely disappointed and
frankly, quite ashamed.

Whether: or not we approve of

more furious that much of it was in
the name of Christianity. Search
the Scriptures and you will find that
mercy, compassion, and love are
the basis of God’s love, not passing
judgment. “Do not judge, and you

will not be judged,” (Luke 6:37, 41-
42), but instead, “be merciful, just
as your Father is merciful,” (Luke
6:36). In Paul’s letter to the Ro-
mans, he says, “therefore let us stop
passing judgment on one another.
Instead, make up your mind not to
put any stumbling block or obstacle
in your brother’s way” (Romans
14:13). None of us are free from
sin, and therefore none of us are free
to judge. Is it not wrong that our
legislators have deemed themselves
godly enough to condemn another
group of human beings by isolating
them and “putting them in their
place?” Should we not always dem-
onstrate love and compassion to-
wards each other?

“Love is patient, love is kind.
It does not envy, it does not boast, it
is not proud. It is not rude, it is not
self-seeking, itis not easily angered, _
it keeps no record of wrongs. Love
does not delight in evil but rejoices
with the truth. It always protects,
always trusts, always hopes, always
perseveres” (1Corinthians 13: 4-7).

No Time to Smell the Coffee

Too much s—tin too little time.

For me, that’s college in a nut-
shell. And I'd be willing to bet a
pretty penny I’m not alone — on
this particular campus and count-
less others.

It’s this time of the academic
year that makes me wonder whether
we — the young minds and future
of America — are scholars in train-
ing or rats in a never-ending race. I
glance at my April calendar—satu-

why Captain Indifference has a
choke-hold on our little world.

It’s obvious; if you’re not a
genius (and very few of us are) and
you want to do well—or even stay
afloat—academically, you have to
devote your school-year-life to the
almighty book.

Alas, I buck the trend. In a
typical week, I'll spend more time
fulfilling Davidsonian-related tasks
than studying. The results—on both

how to survive in the frenetic cul-

doing both? And ifso, how much of

Would the elimination of
grades or maybe just deadlines make
it so we could actually concentrate
on what we’ re supposed to be learn-
ing?

But seriously, in a world of
higher education wracked with
grade inflation, Davidson suppos-
edly stands as a bastion of grade
deflation, one of the last of a dying
breed, a beacon of hope.

This, however, creates a fren-
zied academic environment, one in
which smelling the coffee is adown-
rightimpossibility if classroom suc-
cess is high on (oreven just on) your
list of priorities.

Free time here is deceiving.
Probably because it’s really not.
Chances are, if you’re just chilling
out, there’s something “productive”
you should be doing instead.

A cancerous apathy eats at this
campus in every realm but the class-
room. That makes me angry, but
that’s not to say I don’t understand

fronts—are expected and self-ex-
planatory.

Ido strive for balance, but usu-
ally stumble well short of the desir-
able goal.

But not everyone is willing to
do this. In fact, very few people are.
And I absolutely sympathize.

Personally, I only justify tak-
ing academic hits because my con-
siderable work at the Davidsonian
is pointed directly toward a career
in journalism. I willingly missed
the well-rounded boat long ago. At
this point, it’s either work in the
sports media or live in a dumpster.

Really, I don’t have any an-
swers. But I do have questions—
questions that clutter my already-
jumbled mind.

Are we learning how to think

wrong reading my application?

But when push came to shove a
good while back, and when the
shove is becoming increasingly vio-
lent, as is currently the case in my
crumbling academic world, even
I’ve got self-pride to try to uphold.

It’s April, and it’s the books I
must hit.

Oh, I'd love to smell the pro-
verbial coffee. But if I want to do
reasonably well in the classroom (a
little pipedream of mine, though a
dream nonetheless), [can’t begin to
even think about smelling the cof-
fee, drinking the coffee. Hell, I
shouldn’t even Jook at the coffee.

And the same goes for those
roses —no smelling, no picking, no
admiring.

Because I got s—t to do.

Last week, I went down to
Chambers Gallery to donate blood.
I hate giving blood. It interrupts
my day and takes up an hour or so
of my precious Davidson time.
The Red Cross nurses bombard
me with personal questions. That
needle, it’s big. That’s an under-
statement — it’s absolutely enor-
mous. Plus, I don’t get around
very well without that pint of blood.
Isometimes get hot and cold spells.
often feel faint. And at the end of
the ordeal, all I get in return for my
efforts is a little sticker that says,
“Be nice to me — I gave blood
today.” Be nice to me? That’s it?
People are generally nice to me
anyway. If I give away a ninth of
my blood supply in one hour, I'd
like a little more appreciation.
Actually, I’d be satisfied with a
little more company.

Ididn’t see many of you at the
Gallery on Wednesday. Why was
that, I wonder? I recognize that
good excuses exist. I’m not ad-
dressing those of you with
unarguably legitimate excuses not
to give blood. I’m addressing those
of you who make flimsy excuses
to get out of blood donation.

Let’s begin with the all-too-
common excuse “I’m scared.”
Don’t worry about it then. The rest
of us will take care of providing
the 40,000 pints of blood that are
needed every day. The rest of us
don’t think that giving blood is
scary. We look forward to that big
fat needle and that woozy feeling.
What’s scarier: donating blood or
finding out that someone you love
was in an accident and would have
a chance of survival if only more
people had been brave enough to
donate blood for use inemergency?

Here’s ariother good one: “I
don’t have enough time.” Well,

pus? Those of us who donated
blood didn’t do it because we had
nothing better or more pressing to’
do that afternoon. We did it -be-
cause we believe that someone’s
life is more precious than an hour
of our time. On the busiest day of
your life, if I personally told you
that I would die if you didn’t take
an hour of your time to help,
wouldn’t you do that for me? I
think and I hope that your answer
to that question is “yes.” Every
time you give blood, you’re giv-
ing up to four people another
chance at life. If you pass that
opportunity up, you are, in effect,
saying that an hour of your time is
more important to you than a
person’s chance to live.

There are lots of other similar
excuses out there. You’ve heard
them. Perhaps you’ve even said
them. What all of these excuses
boil down to. When I donate
blood, I’m giving this testimony:
“Giving blood hurts. It makes me
dizzy. It’s scary. It’s time-con-
suming. I hate it all around. But,
you know what? It’s worthit. It’s
worth it if it will give you or
someone you love or someone
you’ ve never met before a chance
to live beyond a day that may very
well have been their last.” Only
5% of healthy, eligible donors
donate blood each year. It hurts
me that the other 95% are unwill-
ing to repeat my testimony.

It’s obviously too late to go
back in time and give blood last
Wednesday. You’re in luck,
though, because blood drives are
not rare occurrences. So, next
time: give for me, give for people
you don’t know, give for the free
cookies and juice, give for the free
sticker, or give because you don’t
want to give lame excuses any
