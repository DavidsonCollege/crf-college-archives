PROFESSOR JOSEPH MARION |
MOORE IS HONORED ALUMNUS

Prof. Joseph Marion Moore, 1891, @
one of Davidson’s most distinguished
educators. He was born in McConnells-
ville, South Carolina, and attended
school there until he came to Davidson
in 1886. He did not receive his A.B, de-
gree in 1890, but came back and received
both his A.B. and M.A. degrees in 1891.
In taking his M.A. degree he specialized
in English Literature under Dr. W. S.
Currell, who is now president of the
University of S. C.

As a student Mr. Moore was interested
in literary and educational subjects as
well as developing into an interesting
and attractive speaker. In his Junior
year he won a rep at the Junior oratori-
cal exercises.

After leaving college Mr. Moore went
to Columbia Seminary, of Columbia, S.
C,, but left at Christmas to take up
teaching as a profession. He taught two
years in Kentucky and then held sev-
eral responsible positions in the public
schools of South Carolina.

He married Miss Ashe, of York Coun-
ty, South Carolina, a former student at
Mary Baldwin Seminary, of Staunton,
Va. They have three sons and two
daughters.

In 1913, Mr. Moore was called from the
superintendency of the schools of Beau-
fort,-S. C., to the head of Mitchell Col-
lege, of Statesville, N. C. He has suc-
cessfully conducted that institution for
the past eight years. Under his admin-
istration the school has grown in size
and increased its standards of scholar-
ship.

He is an elder in the First Presbyte-
rian Church of Statesville and is the suc-
cessful teacher and leader of the Men’s
Bible Class of that church.

Mr. Moore has several prominent
nephews who are Davidson men. Among
these are: Dr, J. W. Moore, who prac-
tices medicine in Louisville, Ky.; J. P.
Moore, who teaches school in McCon-
nellsville, S. C., and J. S. Moore, captain
of the Wildcat eleven for next year.

The trustees of Mitchell College de-
cided recently to change the: system of
administration, and as Mr. Moore did
not apply for the position of. president,
it was given to Rev. W. F, Hollingsworth,
vho graduated at Davidson in 1890. Mr.
Moore has been offered the presidency
of Sayre College, in Kentucky, but it is
not known yet whether or not he will
accept the position,

ALUMNI PRESIDENT URGES
CLASSES TO HAVE REUNIONS

Alumni Editor,

Davidson, N. C,

Dear Sir: I note from catalog that the
meeting and luncheon of the Alumni As-
sociation will be held on Ist June, at 1
o’clock p. m.

This, I am glad to say, is a much bet-
ter arrangement than we have ever pre-
viously had for the meeting. It should
give us more time, without interference,
for the transaction of the business of the
association, and this we have needed for
a long time.

I wish that you would exert your ef-
forts, every week, in The Davidsonian,
for a number of class reunions this year
and for a large attendance of the alumni.
If I can help you in any way, then advise
me. Yours very truly,

R. M. MILLER, JR.,
Pres, Alumni Asso.

SUCCESS.

To render meritorious service
and refrain from egotism—to ap-
preciate recognition but scorn ap-
plause—to study earnestly and pro-
duce conscientiously—to do your
work well, as much for the love of
the work itself as for your reward
—to practice self-denial and grant
benevolent consideration to oth-
ers; that is the principle of prog-
ress that pushes men up the ladder
of success.

None need fear that they will
not fully share in the progress they

- promote; for every man’s work
is a silent and insistent declaration
of his true worth.—Selected.

He labors hard there at his desk,
And figures, fumes, and frets,

For in the spring a student’s fancy
Lightly turns to thoughts of—debts.
