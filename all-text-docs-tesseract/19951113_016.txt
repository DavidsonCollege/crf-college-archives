November 9, 1995

When you had your call to
write — which you previously de-
scribed as almost a religious ex-
perience —did it occurallat once
or did it happen gradually?

It started a little here at
Davidson. I began to write for The
Davidsonian, and | also wrote for
the Scripts and Pranks ... And |
wrote articles — not very seri-
ously. I was getting an early start
while I was here, but I had not yet
really gotten myself deeply in-
volved in the idea of writing. And
then because of the War, I was sent
to Duke in the Marine Corps, the
Marine V-12 program, and while I
was at Duke | fell under the influ-
ence of the remarkable teacher
named William Blackburn. He
was a professor of Renaissance
literature, but he was also a teacher
of creative writing. I began to
write in his course, but more im-
portantly, at that time, I began to
read a great deal, and it just so
happened that I fell into this spell
of reading that included reading
virtually anything I could get my
hands on. I suppose a catalyst was
Thomas Wolfe, and I don’t know
whether his work is read much any
longer. He was a famous North
Carolinian, and he was a writer of
great power. His name is sneered
at in certain areas because he is so
adolescent, but I was adolescent,
too. His writing corresponded with
my own feelings and emotions and
was a very great influence. I began
to read other writers. I began to
read everything I could lay my
hands on. And because of that, I
decided I wanted to be a writer.

When you first started writ-
ing, did you struggle with the pro-
cess, or did it:flow easily?

Well, it flowed very easily,
because at that time you don’t re-
ally realize how difficult it is. So
you just sort of plunge in, and you
feel it’s such aspontaneous act that
it doesn’t require a great — at that
time — sense of discipline. Of
course that comes later. I was just
writing short stories and sketches,
loving — just loving — the idea of
putting words on paper.

When did you decide you
wanted to sit down and get serious
about writing a novel?

Well, I had gone to New York
after I graduated from Duke, and I
worked in a publishing house, but
that didn’t last long. As soon as I
left this publishing house, I de-
cided that I better tackle really
what I wanted to do all along. I
realized that the publishing job —

being an editor — was a kind of
diversion, and that what I really
wanted was to write. So I began to
write the first pages of what turned
out to be Lie Down in Darkness,
my first novel, as soon as I got out
of publishing.

I’ve noticed that your books
were published quite a few years
apart, and I was wondering about

your process of writing?

During that interim time, I’m
often writing other shorter things
such as articles. It’s no simple task
to describe how you conceive an
idea ... Well, why don’t we have
an example: Sophie’ Choice. Itis
something that haunted me for a
long, long time. After World War
II, I went back to Duke and I read
abook about Auschwitz calledFive
Chimneys by a woman doctor. It
impressed me mostly, because she
describes how when she arrived at
Auschwitz with her children she
made — not a choice like Sophie
did — but a decision which in-

She and I struck up an acquain-
tance, and we got to know each
other. I was about I0 years younger
than she was; she was in her early
30s, and I was, as I say, in my 20s.
So we had akind of awkward, brief
friendship. I left the place, and I
didn’t see her again.

Then many years later in the
‘70s, I was casting around for some-
thing to write about, and I sud-
denly said, “What if I wrote a book
that would describe the fact that I
met this girl Sophie and instead of
leaving her, which is what I did, I’d
get to know her a lot better. I’d get
to know she had a boyfriend, so I
would have one level of experi-
ence to describe knowing her in
Brooklyn. And then suppose she
revealed to me a secret about
Auschwitz which was similar to
the one that was described in this
book, Five Chimneys.” Then I
said to myself, “Suppose she re-
vealed to me at the end of this book
that she had had to choose which

century:

William Styron, Pulitzer prize-winning novelist, had a chance in
his busy stay at Davidson to talk to students about the different aspects
of his extremely rich and productive life. He is the author of nine
critically acclaimed books. His novels include Lie Down in Dark-
ness,1951; Set This House on Fire, 1960; The Confessions of Nat
Turner (Pulitzer prize winner), 1967; Sophie’s Choice, 1979; Dark-
ness Visible: A Memoir of Madness, 1991; and A Tidewater Morning:

In Styron’s two most famous novels, Sophie’s Choice and The
Confessions of Nat Turner, he tackles the institutionalized evil of the
Holocaust and slavery. In his memoir, Darkness Visible, he recounts
his tremendously difficult battle with clinical depression.. In the
majority of his works he deals with the existence of evil, and its
potential to twist and dominate humanity.

Both in writing and in person, William Styron is an extremely
interesting and provocative person. His many experiences, contribu-
tions to society, vast knowledge of literature, and thoughtful, pen-
etrating writing made him an important literary figure of the 20th

volved her own children, and they
died; they were sent to the gas
chamber. She misjudged what to
tell the doctors in the selection
process. And this, of course, filled
her with guilt and tormented her,
and then she went on to describe
the horrors of Auschwitz. That
remained with me as a very vivid
picture of Auschwitz.

Soon after that, I moved to
New York and lived in a rooming
house in Brooklyn where I met a
real person named Sophie. This
book has autobiographical ele-
ments, and one of those autobio-
graphical elements is the encoun-
ter I had with this girl — very, very
similar to what I’ve described in
the book — she being a survivor of
Auschwitz and a very beautiful
girl with a tattoo on her arm. I
didn’t get to know her too well, but
I got to know her well enough that
she fascinated me, because she had
this history of being a survivor.
She spoke some English, but it was
very broken. She had just arrived
from a refugee camp in Sweden.

one of her children were going to
live ... This would probably be the
greatest symbol or metaphor for
the horror of the Nazi concentra-
tion camps that I could possibly
find.”

What affect do you think the
Holocaust had on the idea of a
universal faith in God?

I think the Holocaust was one
of those events that really did test
people’s faith. Especially, I think
this is a theological problem among
Jews. There have been whole vol-
umes of works in the Jewish theo-
logical world addressing this whole
issue. My response to that — I
think I can find it, because it is at
the very end of the book. It’s
where Stingo, the narrator, is re-
membering several things he wrote
in his notebook, and he remembers
only two or three things, but one of
them was the following: “Some-
day I will understand Auschwitz.”
This was a brave statement but
innocently absurd. No one will
ever understand Auschwitz. What
I might have set down with more

accuracy would have been: “Some-
day I will write about Sophie’s life
and death, and thereby help dem-
onstrate how absolute evil is never
extinguished from the world.”
Auschwitz itself remains inexpli-
cable. The most profound state-
ment yet made about Auschwitz
was not a statement at all, but a
response.

The query: ‘At Auschwitz,
tell me, where was God?’

And the answer: ‘Where was
man?’

So that’s about all one can
say. It’s as if at Auschwitz the
experiences have tested the faith
... and the answer is that there is no
faith possible except faith in what
man can produce. I think it did
shatter a definite sense of belief in
those who were supposed to have
belief inthe first place.

I want to parallel what you
just said about the Holocaust with
Darkness Visible. Throughout
Darkness Visible it seems you

talk a lot about the needed sup-
port of family and friends, but not
much about the support of reli-
gion or God. Why do you think

this is so?

I will say this — that the first
page of Darkness Visible is from
Job:

“For the thing which

I greatly feared is come upon me,
and that which I was afraid of

Is come unto me.

I was not in safety, neither

had I rest, neither was I quiet; .
yet trouble came.”

I used that, because during
this ordeal I did read Job. I read
Job over and over again, and I
remember being profoundly af-
fected by it, because I think it could
be argued almost 2,000 years or
more, 3,000 years later, that Job
was suffering from a terrible men-
tal agony, and his faith was being
tested, certainly. When onie goes
through this kind of horror, you try
to find answer. So all I was doing
was to respond to the traditional
question — why? Why am I being
subjected to.this? I didn’t particu-
larly have any other religious im-
pulse other than that. To that ex-
tent I think maybe there was a
resemblance to the people in
Auschwitz ... I don’t think it’s
