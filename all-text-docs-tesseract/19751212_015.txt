The Davidson production of
Broadway’s musical ‘1776’
was a successful, somewhat
enlightening, and entertaining
one.

The plot of ‘1776’ is set in
the time of the signing of the
Declaration of Independence.
Every schoolboy knows, of
course, that our founding
fathers met in Philadelphia, in
the summer of 1776, issuing
forth Jefferson’s famous docu-
ment.

We expect, we know, what
the outcome of the story will
be: the Declaration will be
signed, America will win her
independence, and somehow
we will come to what we are in
1975.

However, in ‘1776,’ the
picture painted of our found-
ing fathers is not so solemn,
not so inevitable, as our
schoolboy’s image of the past.
The Continental Congress,
such as it was, is portrayed
comically: somehow they

bumble their way into creating
the United States of America.

Comic confusuon,

historic exposition

On the other hand, we
would be perhaps going too
far if we were to characterize
‘1776’ as comic pure and
simple. Somehow, after all,
despite the comic confusion,
America is born, Thus, one of
the chief successes of ‘‘1776”’
is that it is at once a spoof and
an exposition of “patriotic”
history.

Most of the musical num-
bers of ‘'1776”’ (although not
all of them) complement the
serious and comic of ‘‘1776”’.

Franklin and Adams \ook as Mar-
tha Jefferson sings “He Plays the
Violin”.

“The Lees of Old Virginia,’
and ‘‘Cool, Cool, Considerate
Men”’ on. the whole achieve
this purpose. All are quite
comic, lively, and entertain-
ing—even for one (such as
myself) who has a natural
aversion to musicals.

In addition, the final num-
ber before the intermission
(“Mamma Look Sharp,” sung
by Jim Wilkins), adds little,
aside from the maudlin, which
seems quite out of touch with
the rest of the play.

‘1776’ contains some
strong acting, coming mainly
from the play’s antagonists.
Pennsylvania’s John Dicken-
son (Robert Ousley) and South
Carolina’s Edmund Rutledge
(David Vosburgh) successfully
play two arrogant and almost
despicable villains. Ousley’s
and Vosburgh’s forceful act-
ing, I might add, almost (but

- not quite) stole the perform-

ance away from the play’s
heroes, Franklin, Adams, and
Jefferson.

John Adams, played by
Don Perkins—who, incident-
ally, also directed the play—
was perhaps the dramatic hero
of ‘1776’. Perkins on the
whole was a good Adams,
despite the fact that as pro-
tagonist his role was a bit
limited —we do, after all, know
that he will succeed.

Benjamin Franklin (Sam
Kressen) was, I think, a more
difficult role to play, since—
through historical mythology
(as Adams tells Franklin ..at
one point)—we are better ac-
quainted with Franklin than
with Adams. We expect Fran-
klin to be a sage, perhaps even
a bawd: where Kressen and
the play succeed, though is in
maintaining this popular
image of Franklin, yet at the
same time spoofing it.
