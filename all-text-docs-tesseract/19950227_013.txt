Tournament Time, Baby!

Women’s
b-ball

to face
tough

opposition

The schedule maker
was not very nice to the
Davidson women’s basket-
ball team.

WOMEN'S

BASKETBALL

As if the Wildcats
hadn’t had enough trouble
with other Southern Confer-
ence teams this season, they
had to go up against regular
season champion East Ten-

nessee State Sunday on the -

Wildcats’ senior day.

In Kristin Solsrud’s last
game at Belk Arena, the
Buccaneers beat Davidson,
89-71.

Now, the Wildcats will
have to face ETSU again in
the first round of the South-
ern Conference tournament
Wednesday in Johnson City,
Tenn.

Sunday, Kristen
Ferrucci scored 18 points,
Tonya Sharpe went for 13
and Carolyn Kirsch added
12 points.

League-leading ETSU
(18-6, 11-3) gota game-high
30 points from DeShawne
Blocker, 16 from Amy
Engle, 15 from Justina
McClellan and 12 each from
Sharon Jones and Wendi
Reed.

That loss came on the
heels of Friday’s tough 68-
65 defeat at home to
Marshall. In that game,
Kirsch played very well,
coming up with 20 points
and 20 rebounds, but the
Thundering Herd went on a
17-2 run to open the second
half.

Earlier in the week, the
Wildcats traveled to Geor-
gia Southern and camehome
with a 86-68 defeat. Kirsch
again led the squad with 14.

On Sunday, Davidson
shot a solid 50.9%, but was
out-rebounded by eight and
committed 27 turnovers to
ETSU’s 14.

ETSU opened the game
by jumping out to an early
14-2 lead, but the Wildcats
responded with a spurt of

their own to close within 23-
22. Butthe Buccaneers came
back to finish the first half
strong and take a 13-point
lead into the break.

In the second half,
Davidson couldn’t get any
closer than 11, and ETSU
ran away to the final margin.

The loss ends a frustrat-
ing regular season for the
Wildcats (4-22, 0-14). It
ends a season that saw them
come oh-so-close to nabbing
a conference win several
times in their first full sea-
son of conference play.

Italsoends aseason that
points to the future. While
the squad will obviously
miss Solsrud next season, it
has everyone else returning
and also has an excellent re-
cruiting class coming in.

Right now, however, the
future for Davidson is on
Wednesday night, when the
team must try to do some-
thing it failed to do twice
already this year — knock
off the powerful Buccaneers.
Should the Wildcats be able
to do that, they would ad-
vance to the semifinals Sat-
urday and Sunday.

Wrestlers look for edge

Team strives for mental intensity

By JoHN RoE

With the Southern Con-
ference championships fast

‘approaching, the Davidson

wrestling team is trying to
find the winning combina-
tion again.

WRESTLING

The team was wrestling
as well as they had all year
just a couple weeks ago, but
recently the Wildcats have
suffered a couple losses.
Coming off losses to Ten-
nessee-Chattanooga and
Appalachian State, the squad
was stunned by Campbell
last week, 43-3.

“Although we were
banged up and tired, we were
not mentally prepared and
we wrestled without inten-

sity,” coach Tom Oddo said.

Jason Deaton provided
the only highlight of the
match when he turned his
Opponent over with a

peterson move and hung on ©

for a 5-3 victory.

The team did not havea
match over the weekend, so
the much needed rest will
help the Wildcats prepare
for this weekend’s confer-
ence tournament in
Asheville.

Says Oddo, “We will be
able to rest and recuperate
from our injuries and very
tough schedule.” The Wild-
cats should have Seth
Herman and Jesse Kenner
back in the lineup, but Ben
Wall will likely be forced to
sit out once again.

The toughest competi-
tion will come from VMI
and Appalachian State, but
the Wildcats hope to chal-
lenge the other teams for
third place.

This week the team will

practice hard to get into peak
mental and physical shape.
Mental toughness is the key
to winning those tough
matches, and the teams
seems to be regaining their
mental confidence.

“We are pumped up for
this weekend,” 190-pounder
Barrett Rose said, “and with
a good week of practice, I
think we can do very well.”

Every match will be
tough, so the wrestlers will
approach each match as if it
were their last of the season.
A large crowd would defi-
nitely help the Wildcats
achieve their goals this
weekend.

If you want to go, the
wrestling will be from 8 a.m.-
12 p.m. Saturday and 8 a.m.-
1 p.m. Sunday. Tickets can
be purchased through the
Davidson ticket office or at
the gate. A ticket package,
including basketball and
wrestling passes, can be pur-
chased as well.

Wildcats
attempt
to string
together
3 wins -

By Matt Pitzer

The men’s basketball
team’s search for consis-
tency reaches its most criti-
cal stage this weekend as
Davidson heads into the
Southern Conference tour-
nament in Asheville.

MEN'S

BASKETBALL

Despite Saturday
night’s 81-76 loss at
Marshall, the Wildcats (13-
12, 6-7) have practically

’ locked up the third seed in

the Northern Division of the
conference. They can guar-
antee themselves of that spot
by beating Furman tonight,
which is the regular season
finale and senior night for
George Spain and Tim
Caldwell.

By finishing third, the
Wildcats set up a first-round
game against Western Caro-
lina Friday at 9:30 p.m.

The Catamounts beat
Davidson in Belk Arena Feb.
4, 69-68, as Anquell
McCollum nailed a three-
point shot with eight sec-
onds remaining for the win.

Saturday night, Bran-
don Williams led Davidson
against Marshall with 19
points, Quinn Harwood had
15 and Chris Alpert tossed
in 13. The Wildcats shot 60%
from the field; including 10
three-pointers, easily one of
their best shooting nights of
the year.

The number that hurt
them, though, was 25--as in
25 turnovers. Down, the
stretch, the Thundering Herd
scored nine straight points
to take control of the game
in the final minute.

- That loss followed an
equally frustrating loss Mon-
day night at VMI, which
came just two days after a
brilliant effort at The Cita-
del. But the entire season for
the Wildcats has been marred
by ups and downs. The high
points have included wins
