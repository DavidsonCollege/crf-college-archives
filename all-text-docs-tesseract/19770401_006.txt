History: a relevant study for today?

By DAVID E. SHI
Faculty Guest Columnist
The discipline of history is in
trouble. In a recent presidential
address to the Organization of

American Historians, Professor
Frank Freidel of Harvard asserted
that “the historical profession is in a
State of crisis.’’ And there is ample
evidence to justify such a jeremiad-
like pronouncement.

A new survey of college-bound
high-school students in 100 repre-
sentative schools reveals that of the
21 subjects in their curriculum they
regard history as the ‘‘most irrele-
vant.’’ Some states require practically
no prior training in history for
high-school history teachers. At the
college level, the number of students
majoring in history or taking history
courses has declined as emphasis has
shifted to ‘‘more relevant”’ disciplines
(history at Davidson represents an
exception to the trend).

As a result of this shift away from
history, young Americans are enter-
ing adulthood without even a rudi-
mentary knowledge of their country’s

past. A New York Times poll last year
of 2,000 college freshmen at 200
institutions revealed that “this group
of students knows remarkably little
American history. Their knowledge of
the colonial period is primitive.
Two-thirds do not have the foggiest
notion of Jacksonian democracy. Less
than half even know that Woodrow
Wilson was President during World
War I.’’ Several probably did not
know who is buried in Grant’s tomb!

Americans have not always had
such an appalling lack of historical
consciousness. The Founding
Fathers, deprived of the mesmerizing
banality of television, had a vigorous
sense of history. Madison and
Hamilton devoted much of the
Federalist papers to an analysis of
historical predecents for a constitu-
tional confederation. They made ‘‘no
apology for having dwelt so long on
the contemplation of these federal
precedents. Experience is the oracle of
truth; and where its responses are
unequivocal, they ought to be conclu-
sive and sacred.”’

Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson were historians in addition to
being Presidents. But in recent years
concern for history has waned among
political leaders and the general
public. George McGovern is a history
Ph.D.—and look what happened to
him. A reading of President Carter’s
autobiography reveals few historical
references, a surprising omission con-
sidering his Southern heritage. As
Gavin Stevens emphasized in
Faulkner’s Requiem for a Nun, ’’the
past is never dead. It’s not even
past.”

One wonders as Carter embarks
upon his crusading, messianic foreign
policy whether he aware of the pitfalls
that befell Woodrow Wilson when he
adopted a similar stance sixty years

ago.
Why has history lost its meaning
and attraction for so many

Americans, especailly young people?
One obvious factor is the changing
nature of our society. In today’s
modern technocratic age, with its
overweening emphasis upon technical
expertise and professional careers,
students naturally question the utili-
ty of history. Post-graduate vocation-
al concerns have increasingly dulled
student sensitivities to the drama and
lessons of the past. Wordsworth
recognized such a myopic orientation
when he wrote:

A primrose by the river’s brim,

A yellow primrose was to him,

And it was nothing more.

Part of the problem is that students
come to college with certain precon-
teived ideas about designing a pro-
gram of study suitable to their career
choice. For example, some believe
that to become a doctor one must
major in the sciences or to become a
successful businessman, one should
major in economics. Yet at Davidson
this year a senior history major has
been accepted at medical school. In
addition, one of the professors in the
economics department was an under-
graduate history major.

The point is that history can be
meaningful, it can open up exciting
vistas, and it can provide a student
with the intellectual skills to succeed

Stuarts favor Christians

To the Editor:

In the past, Christians and non-
Christians alike could compete for
academic scholarships at Davidson.
Devout Christians may have had an
edge over agnostics, atheists and
members of other religions, but at
least this was not too blatant.

Now the Stuart Scholarships,
Davidson's largest, and implicitly
highest, academic scholarships are
reserved for Christians only. Last
week The Davidsonian quoted Seddon
Goode, chairman of the Stuart Schol-
arship Fund's Board of Directors as
saying, ‘Christian character is the
cornerstone of the Stuart Scholarship
program...outstanding students of
the Jewish faith and other students
could compete for conventional schol-
arships.”’

The college hopes that this scholar-
ship will encourage outstanding stu-
dents to some to Davidson—but only
Christian outstanding students.

When a non-Christian student con-
siders applying to Davidson, what
will he/she think about the fact that
the largest scholarships are reserved

for Christians? I am afraid that once
again Davidson in undercutting the

diversity of the student body.

What is the role of the non-
Christian on the Davidson campus?
We already know the answer with
respect to faculty hiring, but what
about the students? Does the admis-
sions department let in a few non-
Christian students each year in the
hope that the Christians will convert
them? Is the acceptance of this

ATO explains alarming

To the Editor:

As a Military Consultant for ATO,
I would like to clarify a few points
regarding our tank.

First, it is a 1945 Sherman M4, not
a 1943 as Charles Jones '79 erroneous-
ly reported, and is equipped witha
105 millimeter cannon and a Chrysler
engine. The tank is privately owned
by a Concord citizen and we are only
in the negotiating stages.

Second, purchasing the tank does
not equal escalation. The tank is to be
used strictly to maintain a defendible

border. (A non-aggression pact has
been signed with ETC to prove our
good intentions.) Things are getting a
little crowded at ATO, but we will be
content with a fair amount of lebens-
raum.

The American-made Sherman is a
completely justifiable expense, and
the money we pay for it forms the
lifeblood of the corporate profit
structure that makes this country
great. I repeat—mobilization is not
aggregation, as By poli-sci student
knows.

minority an attempt to provide the
Christian students with a mild in-
noculation of diversity or are the
non-Christians entitled to equal con-
sideration as potential members of the
student body?

I think that the students and the
faculty of the college should urge the
Stuart Scholarship Fund’s Board of
Directors to broaden the definition of
“Christian character’’ to any honest,
caring prospective student.

Davidson is, by definition, a
Christian College, and it does not
have to admit non-Christian stu-
dents. As long as it does, however, it
should consider them on an equal
basis with Christian students.

Third, there is no truth to the
rumor that we are employing Cuban
mercenaries to fight for us. They will
leave just as soon as they teach us to
use the new AK-47 assault rifles.

Fourth and last, there is nothing
that a thirty-ton tank could do to
Patterson Court’s grass that would
not be an improvement.

In conclusion, I see no cause for
alarm—after all, if we buy the tank,
we won't have enough money to buy

in any profession. Students, as well as
society as a whole, need to recognize
this fact.

Yet while some students may be
faulted for myopia, we, as teachers of
history must bear most of the blame
for the debilitating condition of our
discipline. Relevance refers not to
what is taught but how it is taught.
History can be dull, very dull, if
teachers never challenge the interest
nor excite the imagination of stu-
dents. The dry recitation of facts,
dates, and events is not enough.
Students today demand more and
deserve more. Lytton Strachey once
observed that history ‘‘is not the mere
accumulation of facts but the relation
of them.”’

The past is a cornucopia of acci-
dents, blunders, surprises, absurdi-
ties, and achievements. If we are to
understand it and if it is to excite us,
then we must impose some order on
it, tie together seemingly disparate
ideas and events and make it relevant
to the present.

Chateaubriand once compared the

study of history to painting a picture.

He recognized that it is necessary to
design the whole in addition to filling
in the detail. If teachers do .not
provide a conceptual design, then the
boring anarchy of isolated facts will
prevail, and many students will
continue to view history like the
tenth-grade girl who described it as a
“course which it seems I have always
studied and which unfortunately
doesn’t promise to go away too soon.”

Besides enabling one to answer
questions asked on Hollywood
Squares, the values of studying
history are no different than they
have always been. Ultimately, the
role of the history teacher is
Emersonian: ‘‘to acquaint man with
himself.’’ In this sense, all young
people can afford to be exposed to the
highest principles of the practicing
historian: a reverence for truth, an
appreciation for literary craftsman-
ship, a knowledge of how contempo-
rary ideas and institutions have
evolved, and an honest understanding
of the best, worst, and average
achievements and failures of the
human existence.

The proper study of history pro-
vides students with a sense of
perspective,.an appreciation for both
the changes and timelessness of the
course of human endeavor. Historical
perspective moderates our instinctive
and pervasive parochialism; it teaches
us modesty and humility, patience
and tolerance. Above all, it can instill
in man a sense of hope. Carl Becker
perhaps expressed it best when he
concluded that the value of history is
“not scientific but moral: by liberaliz-
ing the mind, b eepening the
sympathies, by fortifying the will, it
enables us to control, not society but
ourselves....it prepares us to live
more humanely in the present...and
to meet the future.”’

If we as teachers of history, both in
high schools and colleges, can recog-
nize that our role extends beyond the
mere recitation of facts, then the
discipline of history may soon be able
to retort with Mark Twain that ‘‘rum-
ors of my death have been greatly
exaggerated.”’

Otherwise, America may continue
to turn its back on its, national
experience. An as George Santayana
warned, a “country without a memo-
ry is a country of madmen.”
