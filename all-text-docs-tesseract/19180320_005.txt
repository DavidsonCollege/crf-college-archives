Red Cross News

Tho a bit late, this is our first oppor-
tunity to thank publicly all those who
helped to make the Red Cross entertain-
ment on Monday, the 11th, a success.
The generous assistance of the students
in preparation and performance is most
highly appreciated. If any member
of the ‘‘troupe” has so far es-
caped being thanked personally, we hope
that this may meet his eye and assure
him that these expressions of gratitude
are for him, individually. To Mr. J.
A. Shaw a special vote of thanks is due.
for thru his persuasive and commanding
personality the talent exhibited was col-
lected and presented. Mr. Shaw's con-
tribution was practically the “whole
show,” and our thanks are proportionate.
Surely much of our success was due to
the original and striking advertisements,
so generously contributed by some of the
boys,

Perhaps many a young man in the
audience felt that it wouldn't be so bad
“over there,” if a slight injury would
command the attention of such charm-
ing nurses and entertainers as were act-
ing the part in the show. No wonder
the boys “don’t want to get well!”

Next week we have a story to tell
about the Junior workers, and it will
contain the names of 12 little girls, real
little ones, and what they have done and
are doing for the Work Room.

THAT HORRID BUGLE.

‘There has come the request that some
thing be said abour the infernal machine
which gocs off in the morning after 6:15.
The lights go off at 01:15, which necessi-
tates that we go ta bed with the chick-
ens, but. there is no reason for out getting
up with them. Lf evervone took drill,
this “Can't get ‘em up. Can't get ‘em up
in the morning” delight would be differ
ent. But there are about one hundred
men who do not drill. Many of them
cannot steep after the bell rings when
rollowed by the bugle.

Before there was only one rising bell
tor chapel- there was no. bugle. “Vhis
is no military school, Lf a student can
get up tor chapel by a bell why can't he
get up for drill by a-bell? This thing
af bringing the tin horn around and rais
ing the dead is unnecessary. Why not
stop this useless thing? The bell is sufh
cient and the Hendrixton postlude ex-
ceeds the point of satiety. We are not
Edisons and do not want to be. for we
enjoy our extra hour in the arms if Mor-
pheus.

The DAVIDSONIAN March 20, 1918

WwW. 5. S. NEWS.

The post offices of North Carolina
during the months of December, Jan-
uary and February, sold $780,875 of
Thrift and War Savings Stamps, ac-
cording to a report from the Treasury
Department of Washington tu — State
Headquarters for War Savings Stamps
here. which report was compiled from
the figures of the Post Office Depart-
ment. This amount of sales by the post
offices figures out that the percapita sale
of Thrift and War Savings Stamps in
the State is about 35 cents, and while the
banks have sold probably a similar
amount, the percapita sale remains fat
from what is required of each individual
if the State’s quota of $50,000,000 is to
be reached this year.

From the Treasury report the post
offices of Forsyth County lead the State
with the sale of $60,513.13. Cabarrus
is second with a sale
Other counties making good sales are:
Rockingham, $42.783.31; Halifax, $37.-
581.36; Buncombe, $26.622.00; Union
$25,629.62: and Granville, $23.610.61

One the slogans of the War Savings
Campaign is: “A dollar hoarded is a
slacker: a dollar wasted is a traitor: but
4 dollar savéd and invested in a patriot.”

Mrs. Vaughn, of Greensboro, spent
the week-end with Mrs. Worth.
