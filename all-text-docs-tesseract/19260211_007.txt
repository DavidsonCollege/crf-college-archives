Sallie, Irene and Mary
Is Feature Picture For
Students This Saturday

Garrison Books Former Stage
Success for Week-end

Entertainment

“Sally, Irene. and Mary.” is the picture
to be shown at the gym Saturday night.
Based onthe great stage hit of the same
name, it gives a vivid representation of
stage life on Broadway.

Sally, played Constance Bennett,
Irene by Joan Crawford, and Mary by
Sally O'Neil are headliners in a musical
show in New York. With a view to ce-
menting their friendship, they meet at
the luxurious apartment kept for Sally
by a millionaire admirer, Here Irene and
Mary get their first taste ofthe haute
monde. Irene, dazzled bythe glamor and
worldliness of it all, loses her heart to an

by

artist who is little, if any, impressed by
her. The new environment leaves Mary
unchanged, but she innocently causes
Sally's supporter to fall desperately in

activities, she ac-
cepts the millionaire’s proposal of mar-
riage.

Meanwhile, Irene, spurred by the ar-
tist. recklessly clopes with a college youth
and, in an accident, is killed. This makes
Mary realize the folly of her engage-
ment to the millionaire, and she returns
to her own Jimmie.

Snappy danee numbers Panechion
and Marco feature the picture and it is
said that “Sally, Irene and Mary” has
the most decorative bevy of beauties, in
the roles of chorus and show girls, that
have ever been assembled for a picture.

Other masterpieces are scheduled for
the following weeks. ¢On February 2oth,
“Shamrock.” On the arth “Abe Lincoln.”
On March 6th Marion Davies in “Lights
of Old Broadway” and then on the 13th
and 2oth “Womanhandled” “The

These two, the “Soldier's
and “Keep On Hoping,” made a
decided hit with the students. The jazz or-
chestra, headed by B. T. Crayton, next per-
formed with the excellence of the best.

The quartet, consisting of M. M. Lock-
hart, D. G. Wilson, J. S. Foster, and D. M.
Calhoun, gave several old-time melodies that
were one of the decisive factors in the suc-
cess of the performance. Besides these well-
know songs, these men who had earlier in the
week sung over radio station WBT from
Charlotte, delightful entertained with other
popular numbers of a more recent origin.

“The Beetle and the Flower,” a most dif-
ficult piece, was next presented with dis-
tinction by the chorus. An unusual feature
of of a program of this kind was the next
feature of. the program, in the appearance’ of
the Mandolin club. Roger Womack, Proctor
Thompson, Dick Kane and Worzel, the club's

personnel, played with a unity and precision:

in giving the audience a delightful group of
selections.

A selection from the opera “Rigoletto,”
“Unto a Lonely Abode Diverted,” was the
next classical number to be given by the
chorus of the club. This selection from this
famous Italian opera was presented in an ad-
mirable manner.

The “Creation Hymn” followed with the
whole club taking part. The next number
was the reappearance of the quartet. These
musicians sang -with the same gusto with

which they performed in their initial appear- '

ance,

The closing numbers on this interesting
program of high class entertainment were
two appropriate selections of more than usual
note. “College Melody,” just a group of
songs that the titles implies, was presented
by the chorus. This proved to be the best
of the several songs given by the entire club.
The closing piece was ‘“O! Davidson.”

This program is very much the same as
the one to be given by the club on its South-
ern tour which begins thé latter part of the
month,

J. WILSON STITT

(Continued from page 1)

Nine-tenths of the business of today is
done on credit, which is fundamentally noth-
ing but promises. Marriage is based on the
promise of the two parties to each other and
not on the vows taken before a minister or a
magistrate. The spiritual life, as is the busi-
ness and social life. is based on a promise.
This promise is between God and man. When
man has, through a promise to God, com-
pletely submitted his life te Him, his life. is
from that time on organized by it, his life
pivots on the promise. Examples of this
change of life are found in Abraham, Jacob,
Isaiah, George Fox, John Wesley and St.
Francis. The pivotal promise is a continual
state of mind, a relationship between God
and man,

The second suggestion is prayer, Prayer
is the concentration of the whole soul on}
God. Concentration makes the intellectual
life possible. In Mr. Wilson's own words,
“There is no record where any being attained
spiritual life ‘without silent, habitual, secret !
prayer.” Man hungers for God and _ finds
Him in communion with Him,
sence is always with man. He only needs to
it. The speaker said that he
would guarantee that any man who prayed
habitually for six months would feel a change |
in his life. By prayer he explained he did
not mean “saying prayers’ ‘or reading them
but soul communion with the Creator.

God's pres- |

seck to feel

The third suggestion is Devotion to Hu-
manity, Christian history began with devo-
tion to humanity. Christ lived when Rome
ruled the earth, the world was a slave pen
and men were “dirt cheap.” Christianity is
not an “ism” or a theory but service to hu-
manity. It is not refraining from swearing
or reading a bit of theology at intervals but a!
working love for the people of the globe.
Christ Himself when THe stated His mission |
on this earth, said, “The Spirit of the Lord
is upon me, heeatise He hath appointed me to
preach the Gospel to the poor, He hath sent
me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach de-

Aaa special meeting held in Shearer Tall
the afternoon of Saturday, February 6th, the
Hon, J. Stitt Wilson, former mayor of Berk

and socialist,

addressed the students of Davidson College

lecturer

on the scriptural approach to social and eco-
nomie problems of all time, .
Treating of but one of the many aspects of
what he cally “the voluminous infinitude of
God's Program for Man.” Mr. Wilson an
swered the question, “Is there a social mes-
sage in the Bible?” with direet recourse to
the Bible itself and actual citations from the
Old Testament and the New. This followed
on the hope expressed by Mr. Wilson. that he
might speak on the change in the attitude of

the Scientist since the beginning of the

Twentieth Century. The irreligious during
the past century felt themselves upheld by
Science. Today the reverse is rapidly and
happily coming into being. “The time will
come,” said he, “when science will he one of ,
the bulwarks of religion.”

Mr. Wilson next considered the solution of
social maladjustments in Egypt immediately |
preceding the I-xodus, as related in the Book |
of The had cried out |
against the physical bondage and oppression
they were suffering. Mr. Wilson's vivid
presentation of the calling of Moses brought ,
forth with startling emphasis the way God;
cares for human beings; His eternal mercy,
justice, and loving care. i

Iexodus, Israclites

Turning to the second great division of the
Scriptures, the Book of the Prophets, Mr.
Wilson emphasized the fact that “Nothing of
that time can compare with the ethical and
social message of the Prophets.” But what
Was the great message of the Prophets ?

The ‘prophecies of Old Testament times
were commissioned to “speak for God" to
the people. At times they did predict coming
events, but the burden of their exhortations
fastened upon this, that “God does not want
Isaiah in’ particular
spoke strongly on vaitmess of oblations alone.
The fundamental truth, as true today as
then, was expressed by Mr. Wilson in these

religious ceremonial.”

words “Religion can offer nothing as a sub-
stitute for human justice.”

Mr. Wilson completed the address with an
appeal to remember justice, mercy, and faith
in all relations with our fellowman, The
historic example of Christ and His calling
down woe on the Pharisees for their failure
in this commission formed the forceful
climax of Mr. Wilson's address.

On Sunday afternoon Mr. Wilson spoke to
the Ministerial Band, making a plea for the
Christians of the world today to get down to
actual work, to bring religion and Christian-
ity up from the decline which it is now un-
dergoing. He outlined religion from Christ's
death up to the present time, showing the
declines and rises as they came, and giving
the causes of each.
