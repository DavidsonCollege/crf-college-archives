squad will be present:

Dick Grey kicked goal. The second touch-
down was the outstanding spectacle of the
day. Receiving the Duke punt on their 27-
yard line, Dick Grey dashed back for his
first touchdown of the season. The point
after touchdown failed. Mitchell, going in at
guard for Laws, intercepted a pass about two
yards from the passer and romped across for

Dear Fellow Davidsonian:

know a licking when they meet it. That
intangible something called spirit is an
inseparableyrunning mate with the redj{
and black outfits. Long live Davidson!’ |
You have read that, I know, and you are
prouder than ever of the little red ma-
chine, the name given years ago by this
same coach, and of the wonderful record
they have made in North Carolina this
year. State Champions! For the first
time in long weary years of struggling.

If ever the Davidson alumni in this
community wanted to honor the “Fight-
ing Wildcats,” it is this year and we are
planning a big time for Saturday night,

says Coach Simmons, “She hasn’t any
now; but the scoreboard usually shows
up pretty well in their behalf when the|
referee blows his final whistle and after
all, the detail of ‘who won’ is more or|
less interesting.’ Come to this get-to- |
gether meeting of Davidson men and |
find out what gives them this intangible |
thing called spirit. Don’t fail us this |
time! Obey that impulse. Send in your |
name now!

Grey went off tackle for the extra point. |

Throughout the second half, the Red and!

Nesbit and Grey were consistent and Leg-
| gette went through several times for gains
ranging from five to eight yards at a clip.
Lincoln, Pinkney and Bohannon were down
under punts every time and Ritchie played a
stellar game on the defense. The center of
the line was impregnable, with Laws and
| Boggs supporting McConnell.

| For Duke, Frank dispatching the passes
and Bennett receiving them, were the sen-
sation of the first half. The Blue Devil’s

rented by students, and about sixty-five boys
got to the game in this way. These bussses
left Davidson about 7:00 a. m. Thanksgiving
morning, and got back about 3:00 a. m. the
next morning. This made a rather dull day
of it, but it was worth it. It helped the best
, team in North Carolina win the state cham-
pionship.
‘There’s still another group of travelers
| that I had almost forgotten to mention. Sev-
| eral of the more ambitious boys, not being
| satisfied with their luck in bumming to Dur-
ham via the highway, decided to bum back
via the Pullman, with disastrous results.

Hard luck, boys!
