Davidson needs grade inflation

I was recently visiting
Davidson and the subject of grade
inflation came up. Since I go toa
well-known school where the av-
erage GPA comes in at 3.2, just
below an A minus, I got an earful.
I was told that at schools like my
own students have diluted aca-
demic experiences because As are

way tooeasy to get. But wehaven’t .

cheapened anything. Our academ-
ics remain strong while our system
makes it easier for us to get jobs
because of our higher GPA’s.

The arguments against “grade
inflation” do sound appealing.
Why, after all, should half of a
class receive the grade of A minus
in anything? Where is the excel-
lence there? Why are people at a
such a school at all motivated to
work, andtotruly push themselves?

Whoa. After afew arguments
like that I came back home ready to
change the system. in my univer-
sity. I marched into the office of a
professor and asked him. His re-
sponse was wry:

“If most of the people in my
class are doing excellent work,
shouldn’t I give them grades to
reflect that?” He smiled. “Isn’t
that what fairness is?”

He’s right. Most of the work
done here at my school, and per-
haps this is even more true for
Davidson, is actually good or ex-
cellent. The overwhelming major-
ity of us are good students. But not
because of the grading system.

Even at my school, there is still
significant separation of grades.
Although A minuses and B pluses
are common, Bs and Cs and worse
are by no means unheard of. As
are very tough to get, A pluses are
Virtually unknown.

schools still have enough latitude

A grading system
that emphasizes
merit instead of

competitiveness...

simply would not
detract from the
quality of pedagogy
at Davidson.

in grades to need and wantto work.
Dean’s List and honors are both
available only to students who beat
out other students, so there is still
some significant competition and
a means to tell who truly has the
best grades, if anyone cares to
know.

Generally, however, we are
motivated simply because we want
to learn and would like to do well,

and not because we are afraid of
being smashed by a harsh grading
system.

Outside of a few brutally com-

petitive pre-medical classes, our.

academic atmosphere is often much
different. In a grade system like
Davidson has, Bs or even B mi-
nuses are given to what is objec-

tively quite good work. Students .

are pushed, at least theoretically,
by acompetitive tension. Fear sets
students against each other.

Perhaps the Davidson profes-
sors and students are successful in
overcoming the grading system,
and are rarely or hardly ever af-
fected negatively. But that can’t
deny the problem that your grad-
ing system itself is designed to
emphasize the individual, and not
the group, and thus to harness and
foster a destructive competitive-
ness.

Such a competitiveness is un-
like the real world, anyway, where
teams, businesses, interest groups,
and even nations compete, but
where teamwork and collabora-
tion are of crucial importance.

More importantly, the system
in place at Davidson hurts you in
the job market for no good reason.
In my school’s system one receives
grades based on merit withoutcom-
petitiveness that still encourages
excellence. :

Davidson’s system may work
as well internally to the ‘school,
although I doubt that. But you’re

still shooting yourselves in the foot
when you enter the job market.

I know, you don’t just go to
school to get a transcript and a
diploma in order to find a job later.
Thank God. None of us are so pre-
professional, [hope. Buta grading

stead of competitiveness within a

school simply would not detract
from the quality of pedagogy at
Davidson. On the contrary, it
would liberate students to work
together and learn from each other.

Still, this is no time for self-
foot-shooting. Seriously, [know a
person with very good gradés who
received one offer after 70 cover
letters. i :

Don’t expect it to be easier for

you. When outsiders see your tran-
scripts, they just won’t look as
good, because our grades for the
same work are higher and fairer.

Class averages printed next to
your grades may help those evalu-
ators who both understand math
and know a reasonable amount
about Davidson, but you can’t ex-
pect all your evaluators to meet
both criteria. When they don’t
understand, your job chances suf-
fer.

Students should rightly be con-
cerned about this issue. Faculty
should be even more upset. Stu-
dents are hurt by this as seniors and
after, but faculty get to watch it
happen year after year.

Students can’t know the ef-
fects exactly. “Would I have got-
ten that interview if the grading
system had been based on the mer-
its of my own work, instead of a
harsh comparison with others?”
you’ ll wonder.

But faculty can be sure that
over the years, students are hurt,
undervalued by off-campus evalu-
ators.

The whole world will never
know about Davidson’s peculiar
grading system and how it misrep-
resents its students.

Plenty of places have no idea
about my school, either. But when
they get our transcripts and your
own, they’ll read them both.
They’ Il be more apt to understand
ours than yours.

April: el Raton, frats, and porch furniture

Well, it’s certainly taken me
some time to submit an article to
The Davidsonianafter the finale of
my tumultuous and controversial
tenure as undisputed dictator of
the Opinions Section. I must say
that my protege and successor, the
incomparable Katie McKelvie has
done quite a knock-down job as
this semester’s editor. Anyway,
the advantage for you, the reader,
is that you no longer need to suffer
through columns of absent minded
rambling as I desperately try to fill
space. No, I now have the luxury
of writing only when an issue grabs
my interest.

Issues—hmmmm, something
conspicuously absent from my re-
gime, but I’m flexible. I can try
working with issues. So, I sat
myself down with a copy of “the
South’s foremost College Weekly”
and perused the pages for a poten-
tial ‘debate. I looked, I tried —
honestly — but I’m just not an
issue man. Besides, it’s Spring.
Whocares about controversial top-
ics when the weather is so nice and

voices? Maybe I need help.

Spring. Frat boys are discarding

Frolics. So in this time of celebra-
tion where do we find time for the
rigorous demands of the class-
room? This question has stumped
me now for almost four years until
recently when I had what I can
only interpret as a divine experi-
ence. :

A few days ago, while loung-
ing with some friends on a beauti-

brilliant light directly onto the stark
white physique of my friend. Asa
blinding glare reflected into the
eyes of all onlookers, cries of agony
flew from my companions’
mouths, followed by a series of
comments of beginning with
“Good Lord, I’m blind!” and end-
ing with “in the name of all that is
decent and holy, cover yourself!”

Just as the crumpled garment
landed lightly on the chair the sun
peeked out from behind a cloud,
projecting a gleaming ray of pure,

light (take your pick), my contri-
bution to the future students of this
college: all classes, papers, and
assignments from April 1 to the

end of the year should work on a
bonus system. Thatis, if you go to
class or do the work, you get a
bonus. Or perhaps we should ex-
tend optional class week to include
all of April and make it optional to
students. I’m not saying I would
never go to class. Not at all, I just
think we should all be aware of the
very real infection of Spring Fe-
ver.

Remember, we are a liberal
arts institution that promotes well
rounded students. Now, many of
my friends have taken “well
rounded” as a physical attribute,
but as they gaze admirably at their
bellies I still believe in a balanced,
multi-faceted education.

We have seven months to
worry about traditional learning,
let April be a time to work on the ©
finer points. Consider it life-skills,
physical education, practice in so-
cial skills and networking, what-
ever. Call it what you will, just
please, get outside.

Note: if any of my current
professors have read this article
and interpreted it as an indication
that the weather has prevented me
from completing my assignments .
this, month, consider this piece an
exercise in “the unreliable narra-
tor™ that we so often discuss.
Cheers.
