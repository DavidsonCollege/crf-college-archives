serving of the food, and for the edificatic
of thoso of us who. feel’stranded and out
of touch with civilization here at Davidson,

The break this week will feature hot dogs.
cokes, and a whole raft of fellowship.

and get a ‘load off your poor overtaxed
brain. Join us 4hd fil] up on {ranks and
scintillating conversation.
