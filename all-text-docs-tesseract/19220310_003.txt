THREE STUDENTS ADDRESS
THE SUNDAY “Y” MEETING

Vander Meulen.

The “Y” services Sunday night were
conducted entirely by the “home” boys,
the speakers being: Pat Crawford, Jim-
mie Sprunt, and Mac Richards.

After a song service and selection from
the “Y” orchestra, Pat Crawford made
a talk on “Happiness, the Result of Fel-
lowship with Christ.” Christ is needed
every minute, and one cannot hope for
success and happiness without fellow-
ship with Him, He has met us half-way

and it is up to us to take Him as our)

pattern. To follow Christ doesn’t mean
loss of friends, but quite to the con-
trary, for they will be the more willing
to follow. Happiness and Jesus Christ
gc hand in hand. The Christian reli-
gion is one of happiness and not mel-
aucholy.

Jimmie Sprunt next talked on the
theme “Give God a-Chance.” He is al-
ways ready to open the: doors of op-
portunity for us, if we will only let Him.
We depend on God for our mental and
physical welfare, why not let Him take
charge of our heart? Through prayer
His guidance is received. God will ans-
wer prayers ‘in due time, so give Him
only a chance. We may give Him a
chance by yielding. It is not a question
of how much we have, but how much
God has of us. Are we working fcr self
er for God? Give Him a chance.

Mac Richards made the concluding
talk on, “Will a Man Rob God?” If «we
are not using the time God has given us
to the best advantage,. we are robbing
Him. While in college we are preparing
for our life work, and if we are to make
our lives to be of the greatest service,
then God’s time must be spent accord-
ingly. College life is not to be used for
pleasure. Sometimes we feel our un-
fitness for certain phases of work, .but
unless God has been given a chance, our
possibilities are unknown, Truly God
hes some purpose for each of us in
placing us in such enlightened surround-
ings. As a conclusion to his talk, Mac
made a plea that everyone should se-
riously consider his life work this week
through God’s guidance.

BETTY COMPSON ENJOYED IN
“THE LAW AND THE WOMAN”

Last Saturday night we were highly
entertained by the picture show fea-
turing Betty Compson in “Law and the
Woman.”

The scene was firdg laid in France and
there we saw the love affair of a young
man_and an accomplished vampire. The
scene shifted to America and there we
saw the mnewly-weds, Mr. and Mrs.
Rolfe. Mr. Rolfe was the guardian of
the young: man whom we first met in
France. Later when the young man
came to America the vamp followed him,
expecting to be married to him. Mr.
Rolfe told his ward that -he had once
been a lover of the vamp and tried to
stop the two from going any further.
Mr. Rolfe and his ward had a slight
fight. After Mr. Rolfe left, the vamp
killed her lover and put the blame on
Rolfe.

After all legal remedies had failed it
looked as though Rolfe must go to the
. electric chair:. Mrs. Rolfe finally decided
to disguise as a vamp and see if she

CECIL B. DEMILLE PICTURE

COMING, “SATURDAY NIGHT”

Cecil B. DeMille’s big production “Sat-
urday Night,” was finished one Wednes-
day ‘night.

Sounds a bit confusing, doesn’t it?
Lut from the time Mr. DeMille announce
the title of his latest Paramount picture,
confusion was the order of the day
around the Lasky studio, at Hollywood,
California.

“What are you doing Friday night?”
one actor would ask another.

“I'm working on ‘Saturday night.”

“IT don’t care’ what you do Saturday
night. Iam talking about Friday night.”

“And I told you in plain English that
I am working Friday night on ‘Saturday
Night’ and I can’t accept your invita-
tion,”

“You're working Friday night on Sat-
urday night? Say are you crazy or am
I? Now listen here; quit this nonsense
and tell me: are you working on Friday
night?”

“I'm not crazy.
you again:

I told you and I'll tell
I'm working Friday night on

‘Saturday Night.’”

No .matter on what night the public
sees “Saturday Night” at the gym next
week they will be insured of an enjoy-
able evening, but it is coming on Sat-
urday night, so just remember “Saturday
Night” on Saturday night.

The cast includes Theodore Roberts,
Leatrice Joy, Edith Roberts, Conrad Na-
gel, Jack Mower, Edythe Chapman, Syl-
via Ashton, Julia Faye, John Davidson
and others. :

LIFE-WORK PARAGRAPHICS.

What Your Choice of a Life Work

Means.
A great English philosopher defined
happiness as “congenial work with a

sense of progression.”

The right kind of work develops nat-
ural ability and encourages a man to rise
to his full possibilities. It gives zest and
thrill to efforts that stimulate. It arouses |
a man’s best faculties -and quickens the |
steps of his daily progress. |

The wrong kind of work deadens the |
senses and the impulses to win. It clogs |
the machinery of the mind as well as of|
the body. It effort, |
and all the other things that tend to}
make life enjoyable. The net result is|
inefficiency and discontent. |

Choice of work is one of the most im-|
portant decisions a man makes. Only |
the selection of a wife and of personal |

tandards of conduct rank with it. What
what done it,|
what it leads to, all are largely within |
the control of each individual, Each de-
termines for himself what he will make
of himself,

slowsup. interest,

career is chosen, is in

and his choice spells either |
