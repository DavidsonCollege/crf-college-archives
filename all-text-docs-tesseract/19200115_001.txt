Davidson Men

Seventy-Eight Hundred Delegates at
uty a oa Conference

“Have a good time?” _
“You bet I did. Couldn't help it.’
Yes, a good time was in the bar-
gain and a great deal more for every
one of Davidson’s six representa-
tives at the Eigth International Con-
vention of the Student Volunteer
Movement in Des Moines, Iowa, De-
cember 31 to January 4. Seven
thousand eight hundred delegates
were there, representing over 1,000
institutions and over 40 different
nationalities in the student life of
the United States and Canada.
There were just about as many on
the train leaving Asheville as gen-
erally attend a state conference, and
that was a whole lot. Was David-
son there? Of course she was. liven
when hunger and a freight wreck
forced us at 11 o'clock in the morn-

Game of Season
Saturday

Students Urged to Give Strong Sup-
port — Twenty-Three Games
Scheduled—Nine Games
On the Hill

The 1920 basketball schedule is
the best that Davidson has had for
years. It is especially good in re-
gard to the games to be played on
the home floor. These are to be with
two Y. M. C. A. teams and seven
strong college quints. This gives the
whole student body many good op-
portunities to see their team in ac-
tion and to let them know that the
whole student body is backing them
and expecting them to uphold Old
Davidson’s honor in every one of
the 23 hard games of the season.

Davidson Students to Raise $10,000---
Great Campaign Planned

Teams to Get Busy Monday, January 19—Much Competition Expected

There is no one thing which would
stimulate the Presbyterians of
North Carolina to be liberal when
asked to contribute to the Million
Dollar Campaign for their institu-
tions in North Carolina than a big
gift by the students of these insti-
tutions. To that end the campaign
managers have asked the students
of Davidson College to subscribe
$10,000. This subscription is not a
cash proposition, but is to extend
over a period of four years, and that
ought to be ample time for those in
financial difficulties to recover and
get into a position enabling them to
help out.

The $10,000 campaign will be
started next week on the night of
Monday, the 19th, and the subscrip-
tions will be taken by dormitories.
This is entirely a ‘student affair,

superintend it. We are going to do
it ourselves, and it behooves us to
go over the top a long distance, for
the more the students give, the more
will be given by those who support
the college, and the greater the
benefit thereby.

The following is the list of man-
agers by dormitories. They will
select their teams who will make
the rounds Monday night. When
they come around just remember
that this is not a CASH SUBSCRIP-
TION, and that $23 apiece will do
the work.

Watts—J. R. Boulware, Jr.

Rockefeller Foundation of
New York Offers One
Hundred Thousand

Davidson to Receive Large Sum On
Condition—Another Offer
Pending

The General Educational Board
of New York (the Rockefeller
Foundation) has offered to David-
son College $100,000 on a $500,000
fund. This means that $400,000 at
least must be raised in the Million
Dollar Campaign for Davidson to
secure this offer. In other words,
the Presbyterians of North Caro-
lina must raise a million dollars in
order to make this offer and the
offer of $60,000 of Mr. C. E. Gra-
ham, of Greenville, S. C., become
binding.

The two above-mentioned offers
amount to an aggregate of $160,000.
Is this worth working for? ‘The
answer is with the Alumni of Da-
vidson College and the Presbyte-
rians of North Carolina.

The Colleens Score Big
Hit With Davidson
Students

Splendid Talent Displayed by Per-
formers—Large Crowd Present

Despite the lateness of the train,
and the fact that their costumes did
not come, The Colleens scored a big
success last Wednesday evening.
There were four ladies in all, Miss .
Almina Peterson, violinist and first
soprano; Miss Gladys Peterson, cor-
netist and second sopranc; Mrs.
Wright Armstrong, pianist and first
alto; Miss Dewitt, celloist and sec-
ond alto.

The program opened with an in-
strumental number, Medley of Irish
Songs. Two Irish songs by Miss Al-
mina Peterson, and Kathleen Ma-
voorne by the quartet, followed.
The latter was especially well ren-
dered. A conversation on burying
husbands was given next by Miss
Gladys Peterson. This part of the
program was closed with another
instrumental piece.

The second part of the entertain-
ment was a tribute to the work done
by the Salvation Army in France.
First, Miss Peterson sounded a num-
ber of bugle calls which were re-
markably familiar to those who
were in the S. A. T. C. last fall. Sev-
eral songs were rendered by the
quartet, including Lead, Kindly
Light, Don’t Forget the Salvation
Army, and Salvation Sal. Mrs.
Armstrong closed this part of the
program with a piano solo, Etude in
D flat major_”

The last section was composed of
miscellaneous numbers. There were
several instrumental pieces, solos,
dusts, etc. The hits of the evening,
however, were Qo, Oui, Oui, La, La,
by the orchestra, and Cuckoo, sung
by Miss Almina Peterson. A cornet
solo by Miss Gladys Peterson also
brought a large applause.

Taken all in all, the entertainment
was excellent. The hall was packed
;and the audience extremely appre-
‘ Clative.
