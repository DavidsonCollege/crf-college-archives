Depth, Relevance!

Has Anybody Seen My Face?

Youknow they, or atleast some
of them, say History moves in
cycles. A strictcyclist might there-
fore. hold that what’s happening
these days has happened before,
it’s just that now we’re doing it
with cars. In other words, as noted

David W.
Scott

by those itinerant historical ana-
lysts RATT, what goes around
comes around. So watch your back.

Or maybe it’s all more of a
dialectical thing: thought > a the-
sis or three > synthesis > begin
again. (If you’re curious, read
Hegel. If you’re smart, just men-
tion the name to Prof. Brian Shaw
and receive a brief, gripping-sum-
mary) Of course some might not
care for this view either. I mean,
what’s with ail these theses? If
you’ ve gota good idea, why mess
with it. Such critics might feel
we’ ve been screwing up the Unity
since Eden.

So, to summarize: First con-
ception, “I’ve gota funny feeling
this has happened before.” Sec-
ond, Hegel - Dialectic(yeah!).
Third, Critics - Dialectic(yuck!)
Or maybe the dialectic is cyclic or
the cycle is dialectical, and the
morc stuff engendered the closer
weare to getting back to The Bang!.

That’s probably it, but such
banter can drag on. If you would
like to discuss the matter further
please submit yourself to a good
therapist.

Perhaps about now you might
be wondering what has led me to
the development of such mature
and sustained ideas. Well I'll tell
you. It’s beards. Back a long time
ago Peter the Great wanted to make
Russia modern. So he traveled to
Europe and saw a lot of smooth
faced, sensitive men in turtlenecks
running everything. The little tiger
came home and personally shaved
the beards off his closest advisors
and palace fanny smackers.

Now beards were quite cher-
ished in old Russia, a tradition
thing. Perhaps you might say they
were cool. Historians speculate that
those big-hatted czarists didn’ttake
kindly to Peter’s blade. But Pete
wanted badly to be cool in the eyes
of his co-kings in Europe, (politi-
cally correct?) so he outlawed the
bushy look. I don’t remember the
punishment. Probably something
minor like death without multiple
amputation, but why pick the man
apart? He was on the forefront
of the historically cyclic dialecti-
cal Unity of evolving person-kind.

In Davidson there is a
new synthesis sweeping the cam-
pus fashion scene and it’s growing
all over the faces of males you
probably know. Hair. Lots and
little. Red, brown, unkempt and
copious. We’ve come full circle
from Peter’s paranoia. The cycle

has spun, beards are in, or at least.

coming in, and the penalty for not
sprouting is dire. IBM might hire
you.

And the advantages to fur are
fulsome. First, low maintainence.

The particularly slow to grow have _

an advantage here. If you don’t

tend to bush out like kudzu in heat,

your beard will require basically
no work. A good rule of thumb for
those considering facial hair but
nervous about appearancial (a word

that should exist) ramifications is
that if you are grotesquely smooth
chested a beard will not be hard to
maintain, if it appears at all, and
you almost certainly will not have
to shave your neck.

On the other hand there are
perks only obtainable by the par-
ticularly hairy. For example, one
look I have yet to see but anticipate
with relish (and expect consider-
ing current trends) could only be
achieved by those possessing a
solid mat, or coat if you will,
stretching from nether regions to
sideburns. My idea is sort of a
Mohawk type thing spanning the
stretch between belly-button and
chin. A lot of shaving but worth it.
It could get you on Carson.

As you must see, beards can be
fun for anyone. No wonder they’ re
so popular. Plus, they’re a lot more
comfortable than long hair, oldegg
remants in the frying pan are no
longer a problem, and you finally
have a broom that can get into
those pesky, hard to reach places.

So fur up. Catch a fuzz. And
NEVER degenerate to the wussifi-
cation: “I’m just growing it to keep
my face warm in the winter.”

Flaunt it baby.

And to all those frowny faces
in your life, just remember:

“Til trim, pinch, and twirl,
But if you don’t like it
You ain’t my girl.”

P.S. For anyone previously
inclined and/or inspired by this
article, Jonathon Harris is inter-
ested in organizing a beard tasting
for some time.in late January or
early Feb. So if you’re hankering
for a hunk ‘a aftergrowth, please
feel free to call Jon at his home
mornings, afternoons, or ridicu-
lously late at night.

The writer exists through some
grand coincidence and is a junior
at Davidson because he has always
done his homework. He writes a
column for the paper because he
knows people. Selah.

than face life in a world with honest
representatives and equitable for-
eign policy.

This tendency on the part of the
American people to encourage
egocentrism (national and personal)
in our elected officials has placed
us in a very delicate position. The
President has done exactly what
the American public elected him to
do: he has taken a hard-line, offen-
sive position in order to ensure that
we can remain comfortable in our
gluttony. The only problem is that
we are now up against an individ-

_ ual and a nation that refuse to ac-

cept the proposal that what is best
for the United States is best for
them. Not only do they refuse that
proposal, but they do so with the

well. To be done well means to
satisfy both standards of objectiv-
ity, and fairness, for the faculty’s
sake, but also the product must be
valuable for the students. A prod-
uct like this should attempt to serve
every student. ‘What type of infor-
mation is pertinent even to a major-
ity of students? Would not giving
a record of the average hours stu-
dents spent studying for each class
help the students who are inter-
ested in the subject no matter how

support of a formidable amass-
ment of soldiers whose willing-
ness to die in defense of their soil
surely far exceeds the willingness
of American soldiers to die in trying
to take it from them.

History has taught us that the
only way to defeat a people whose
culture, pride, persistence and
courage make them more willing
to die than surrender is through the
unspeakable horror—of—nuclear
devastation. The United States
has already been guilty of damn-
ing one country to the suffering
that accompanies that kind of
warfare. To even contemplate
doing so again would prove toGod
and man the ugly fact that we in the
United States value our comfort,
our pride, and our corrupt politi-
cians more than the lives of all
people that aren’t “on our side.”
What a bummer that would be.

Seriously, in an ideal situation
the students would work in con-
junction with the administration.
The faculty would probably ap-
prove of and require professional
supervision before anything got
off the ground. I imagine some
sort of revision of the existing
evaluation to include a simple and
brief questionnaire intended for
publications. The questions would
be debated by students and fac-
ulty. The data from the question-
naire could be processed at the
samc time the administration reads
the student evaluations. Scan-
tron sheets might help reduce
labor. Computers might perhaps

hard it is? Could the publication
include evaluations of entire pro-
grams like the Beaufort, N.C.,
Montpelier, France, Wurtzburg,
Germany, India, or Classics Abroad
programs? Or advice about Hu-
manities, the concentration in In-
ternational studies, the concentra-
tion in gender studies; pre-medi-
cine, or individual majors?

Being a junior, I can evaluate
fairly well on the basis of experi-
enceand word of mouth. The fresh-
men and sophomores have a differ-
entsituation. To have known more
specific information the summer
before my freshman year would
have helped me to avoid several
crucial errors I made that still affect
me as a junior. The bottom line is
whether taking the time to collect
and publish suchinformation would
be worth it for enough students.

It would probably make sense
to find out what other schools offer
such a service and model one from
theirs. Idoubtanyone has the desire
or energy to begin something like
this from scratch. We can hardly
get our yearbook going. But the
seemingly apathetic, conservative-
minded Davidson populace might
be more interested in something
which could, if done right, improve
the quality of their education. If
that doesn’t interest you, envision
elevated GPA’s, igi

ease the burden of student labor,
improving the quality of the prod-
uct from that of the pre-word-
processing seventies.
Such hypothetical questions .-

I leave up to anyone who cares to
follow up on this idea. Talk with
an SGA representative or write
something to The Davidsonian. I
believe itis a good idea and worth
discussion. Rather than calling
for the revision of the advisory
system, which would be a monu-
mental task, let's condsider this
do-able one. Ifenough people like
myself have a spiritual crisis ev-
ery registration or Drop-Add pe-
riod, or have suffered with a bone-
head for an entire semester, thenit
is worth the initial step of existing
as an idea. If in time the idea
becomes reality, super. We do
pay for this education and have
theright to havea say in what goes
on, if we act responsibly. If not,
learn from your mistakes.

With the fact in mind that the
evaluations would influence the
peer group and not just the profes-
sor, it could be argued that the
grade the student.is expecting to
receive .would be less likely to
heavily influence the evaluation.
If the student recognizes that the
accuracy of other students directly
influences the quality of the prod-
uct and thereby benefits him or

graduate schools, a higher starting
salary, all of course resulting in a
more attractive spouse.

her directly, he or she would be
encouraged to report accurately
and without malice.
