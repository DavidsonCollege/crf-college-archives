Baker Sports Complex meets with delays

Higher costs equal better facilities

By GEORGE KURANI

After some delay, the de-
velopment of the Davidson Col-
lege sports complex will soon
move forward with construction
set.to begin sometime in De-
cember.’ The sports facilities,
which will be named the Baker
Sports Complex, will cost an esti-
mated $17 million and will help
meet Davidson’s need for im-
proved intercollegiate and intra-
mural activities.

Although no major obstacles
have stood in the way of starting
construction, a rise in the esti-
mated cost of the complex has re-

Davidson welcomes new faculty

Karin English
One of the new faces on the
Davidson faculty this year is
Karin English. Presently a Ph.D
degree candidate in English, En-
glish is teaching English composi-
tion to freshmen at Davidson.
English received her B.A. in
English from Duke University in
1975, and her M.A. in compara-
tive literature from the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in
1982. Realizing that what she
liked most was American litera-
ture and not the more international
-disipline of comparative litera-
ture, she switched back into En-
glish for her Ph.D.

After she earned her M.A.,
but before she enrolled for her
Ph.D., English took a few years
off. First she worked one yeat
with the National Research Coun-
cil advising the government in
Matters pertaining to the social
sciences, especially psychology,
and then she worked from 1983 to
1985 at UNC-Charlotte with a lec-

quired further consideration by
Davidson’s Board of Trustees.
After reviewing past plans for the
facility, the Trustees met and
voted that the design required
some modification ‘to better serve
the college community. The arigi-
nal plans, which would have cost
about $13 million to construct,
were modified in favor of an im-
proved complex featuring several
design changes. Along with these
improvements, however, also
came the increase in the cost esti-
mate to the present day figure of
$17 million.

tureship.

Dr. English is the wife of pro-
fessor John Engel of the English
department.

Between time spent with her
child, on her academic work —
she is taking her oral examination
for the Ph.D. in the fall — and
her teaching here at Davidson,
professor English has little time
for outside hobbies. Even so she
does have time for her interests in
19th-century American literature,
the relationship between film and
literature as narrative, and writing
short stories.

J. Norris Frederick

Another new member of the
faculty, but certainly not a
stranger to the campus, is J. Nor-
ris Frederick, originally from
Charlotte, North Carolina. Pre-
sently dividing his time between
the University of North Carolina
at Charlotte and Davidson, Dr.
Frederick teaches “problems of
philosophy” and “social philoso-
phy” here on campus. At UNC-
Charlotte he teaches a course in

Faculty, Robert C. Williams, to
chair a search committee.

The extensive search included
placing ads in the Chronicle of
Higher Education and contacting
people in other colleges and uni-
versities for recommendations.
When it came down to making a
decision, only two applicants

Gardner comes to Davidson
after spending twenty years at
Cornell University, where he re-
ceived both his masters degree
and Ph.D. in history. He resigned

“from his position there as Senior
Associate Director of Marketing
and Research because he felt a
need for change and a desire to
work at a small liberal arts col-
lege.

The selection of anew Dean of
Admissions -to—replace Hendrix
was not a simple process. Accord-
ing to Associate Dean of Admis-
sions Gardner Roller Ligo, Presi-
dent John W. Kuykendall placed
high expectations and values upon
the position of Dean of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid. Kuyken-
dall named the Vice- President for
— Academic Affairs and Dean of the

were interviewed. Of these two,
Gardner emerged as the choice of
the committee.

‘Described by Ligo as “crea-
tive and energetic,” Dean Gardner

as already—developed-a_strong”

sense of what life at Davidson
College is all about.

Gardner has begun to make an
impact on the admissions process
at Davidson. He plans to make
changes to reflect to the general

public the “high quality” of educa-.

tion and life present at Davidson
College. these changes are neces-
sary, Gardner feels, if Davidson is
to strengthen its claim as a “na
tionally recognized” school.
Gardner feels that people at
Davidson “believe that [Davidson
Collége] is really good, but some

people think that it is so good that. -

tor of Development, feels that the
change in plans is in the best inter-
est of the college and the students.

“If there has been any delay
it’s because we are getting a better
building,” Jones said. “The tnis-
tees realized that the original plans
that were drawn up were not satis-
factory and voted for some design
changes that would effect the use-
fulness of the complex.”

\ The present design incorpo-
rates a 5700 seat arena, 1400 of
which wiil be fixed seating with
chair backs. Among other facili-
ties, the complex will include rac-
quetball courts, a training and

critical thinking and once taught a
course called “metaphor and real-
ity.”

Dr. Frederick earned his B.A.
in philosophy at Davidson in
1970, and his M.A. and Ph.D. in
philosophy from the University of.
Georgia in 1972 and 1977 respec-
tively.

In addition to teaching, he is
the director of the North Carolina
chapter of the nuclear disarma-
ment group SANE; and was at the
Geneva summit between Reagan
and Gorbachev in November of
1985.

Dr. Frederick is a family man
whose interests include tennis,
jogging, and reading history. He
is interested in the application of
philosophical principles to every-
day events, and also in the internal
philosophy of language. His work
with SANE has allowed him to ex-
press these interests. He will be
here for two terms, teaching one
course in the winter. He considers
the Davidson student body to be
interested and well-motivated.

we don’t need, or maybe we don’t
want, other people to know about
it. It needs to be decided which is
more important, national recogni-
tion or keeping Davidson a “sec-
ret’.”

Gardner emphasizes the im-
portance of the composition of the
student body in relation to the
quality of Davidson’s reputation.
The number of minority students,

males, females, alumni children, ©

students of varying financial
‘backgrounds, athletes and stu-

weight room, and what is antici-
pated to be one of the best indoor
swimming facilities in the coun-

Jones thinks that the new facil-
ities will be a great place for the
student body to congregate.

“The sports complex is not
just an improvement for David-
son’s intercollegiate athletic pro-
gram,” Jones said. “All the stu-
dents at Davidson will be able to
take advantage of the facilities,
and intramural events will defi-
nitely benefit from the changes.”

With $11.2 million raised to
date through donations from indi-

5

viduals, corporations and founda-
tions, Davidson is now awaiting
bids on construction of the Baker
Sports Complex. Out of the-
money raised so far, the majority
comes from individual donors and
totals about $7 million. The re-
maining $4 million is almost
equally divided between dona-
tions by corporations and founda-
tions.

The timetable for completion
covers an estimated two years.
Official ground-breaking cere-
monies are scheduled for
Homecoming, October 10, 1987.
The student body is welcome to
attend.

Bob Gardner appointed new Dean of Admissions

some thought and expression into
what we want here,” says Gard-
ner.

Gardner, also noted that in
order to improve some areas of the
college, it might become neces-

sary to sacrifice others. For in-

stance, the higher tuition enables
‘more financial aid to be available
to those students who would
otherwise be unable to attend
Davidson. The college guarantees
100 percent of financial aid to be

granted, primarily in the form of

missions office.

In addition, Gardner has re-
moved the line for the applicant’s
social security number from the
top of the application. He wants
applicants to know that at David-
son College students are names
and faces, not numbers.

Gardner has already begun
reading applications for the class
of 92, and is “off to a good start.”
He personally reads every appli-
cation, as do — at the bare mini-
mum — a member of the faculty

- dents with other talents needed-to— work-study — in order to keep and another member of the admis-

make up a “mix” of students can-
not be left up to chance, he says.
According to Gardner, the
mix now present at Davidsoi,
such as the 60:40 male:female
ratio, was not originally a policy,
but through the years has become
such. In order for the “mix” to re-
flect what the people of Davidson

College want, Gardner doesn’t,

want to make all the decisions but
would like rather to have the input
of those who make up the commu-
nity of Davidson College — trus-
tees, faculty and students.

“It’s necessary for us to put

graduates out of debt.
Gardner also has made

changes in the application for ad-
mission to Davidson College. The
changes are designed to reflect the
personal touch he wishes the ad-
missions process to convey.

From the time a prospective
student receives his or her first let-
ter from Davidson, all his com-
munications with the college will
be personally addressed to him
and will include the name of an
admissions officer who will serve
.as the “tie” between the prospec-
tive student’s home and the ad-

Sions staff.

Although the admissions pro-
cess for each class begins in the
Spring and lasts until the following
June, Gardnes, manages to find —
time for many interests outside-of

his office. He has, at one time or —

another, designed and built his -
own house, raised exotic pheas-
ants, and raised sheep. (His inter-
est in animals goes back from a
childhood spent at the San Diego
ZOO.) -
