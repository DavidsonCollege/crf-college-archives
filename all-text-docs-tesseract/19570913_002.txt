Beginning At First Base

As Dr. Pietenpol says in his letter to the freshmen
(page one), “Opportunities will be offered to you which
you must grasp. Many may come to you several times but
others only once.”

And so we must say that the opportunity of a David-
son College education knocks only once. What will we do
with it? Some have thrown it to the wind, many have
reaped its benefits.

As new members on the rolls of Davidson College,
the freshmen of 1957 are beginning their training for posi-
tions of future leadership in the communities to which
they will return after graduation.

At Davidson, the new freshmen—and the upper-class-
men—will be associated with a group of people that are
superior in every way. All of those who make up the great-
ef college community—the faculty, the students, the ad-
ministration, and the friends—are the type of people who
give Davidson its wholesome atmosphere and who carry
on its rich traditions.

We at Davidson are given more than the average man
who enters college. To begin with, most of Davidson's stu-
dents come here with more. Because the Davidson man
starts with more, more is expected from him. He starts
running, so to speak, from first base.

It is on this account that Davidson has been accused
in the past of producing the “homogeneous man”—people
with the same backgrounds of ideology. religion, social
status, economic standing, and heritage.

To the charge we must plead guilty. But we plead
guilty with a sense of appreciation.

We say these things only to emphasize to the fresh-
men that one of the realities of Davidson is the fact
that most of us will not appreciate the “world of David-
son” until we have graduated—or joined the Army, gone

to ROTC camp, worked away from home, ‘or traveled ex-|

tensively.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

TYPICAL WILDCAT SCRIMMAGE

The 1957 edition of the Davidson Wildcats are shown above undergoing « spirited practice session in preparation for their
clash with Catawba next Friday night at 8 p.m. in Charlotte's Memorial Stadium.

Renovation Work | Push Week Is
Sept. 23-28

Rush Week will begin Monday, September 23, and
will continue through Saturday, September 28, which
has been designated as Pledge Day.

Noted On Campus

Upperclassmen returning to
Davidson have noted the ren-
ovation work that has been
carried out in some of the
older dorms. The biggest sin-
gle improvement has been the
enclosure of thé stairwells -in
East, Cannon, and Watts dorms.

It was pointed out that this
enclosure will serve as a fire-
wall and will considerably les-
sen the noise on the hallways
in the dorms.

Cannon Hall, formerly West
Dormitory, received further in-
terior improvements with the
addition of new draperies. All
dorms have been furnished with
wall fire extinguishers.

Each of the dorms now has
a ‘nameplate at the front which
should eleminate considerable

| confusion among the freshmen.

Oné further. improvement’ is
expected shortly. A public-ad-
dress system will be installed

Here on the Davidson campus the freshmen classi in the dorms.

will experience four of the most pleasant years of their.

life. The only regret they will have is that it all ended
too soon.

And it will end. So now is the time to chart one’s;

course for the next four years, Set your goals. Know your
values and never let down your standards. And whatever
your ambitions—academic or otherwise—go after them
with all you've got.

Take advantage of what Davidson offers. You've al-
ready got a head start.

| BOB LATHAN

After following the Yankees and the Braves all sum-
mer, we must now turn our attention toward the David-
3on Wildcats and their chances for a successful '57 sea-
son.

Head coach Bill Dole, beginning his sixth sea-
son as the Davidson mentor, admits that his boys
have been “looking good” since the early season
drills began the first of the month.

And with all but two members of last year’s fine
line returning along with several seasoned backfield
‘“hosses” you might expect Dole to be floating around on
Cloud 7.

Puzzling Paradox

Such is not the case, however, and therein lies the
paradox. The Wildcats will be stronger overall, but the
absence of a seasoned quarterback
to replace last year’s dynamic duo
of Dick Belton and Dyke Little
could neutralize much of the Pres-
byterian potential.

“Last spring we expected Tom
Cutting, Charlie Benson, and Sam
McQuirt could handle the quarter-
back post this year,” Dole ex-
plained, ‘but all is not so rosy on
the home front now.” McQuirt hurt
his knee last week and Cutting fol-
lowed suit and is through for the
year. Paul Barbee, a standout half-
back last season, was shifted to
the field general slot but is out for a while with an in-
fected toe.

COACH DOLE

_Tom Redding, 6-0, 168-pound freshman quarter-
back from Asheboro, is a “good boy,” says Dole,
“but of course needs a little experience. He‘ll play
a lot of football, though.”

Lone Ranger at QB

Benson (6-1, 178), a sophomore southpaw slinger
from Maitland, Fla., is, it seems, the only boy remaining
from the quarterbacks who have had any experience at
all at the position. “Bobo” McEachern, a soph who
played some at QB last fall, was called up Wednesday to
help out the situation. .

“If our quarterbacks come through, and I have every
reason to believe they will,” Dole talked on, “we'll de-
velop into a well-balanced football unit this fall.”

Line “Best and Biggest”

Prompting such enthusiasm is a star-studded line
of 13 returning lettermen called “the best and largest
I've had since coming to Davidson,” and two hefty soph
fullbacks, 215-pound Dave Warden and 208-pound Dave
McCullough.

Dole is currently running two teams. In the
backfield of one squad he has John Francis and
Ralph Setzter at halves, McCullough at full, and Bar-
bee at quarterback. Backs on the other team are
halfbacks, Brownie Thurman and George Hart, full-
back Warden, and quarterback Benson.

The line of the former comprises Craig Wall and
Westy Westervelt as ends, alternate captain Dave Fagg
and Lanny Voight at tackle, Charlie James and Dave Mc.
Lain at guard, and a 225-pound freshman, Tom Simpson,
at center. The latter eleven has ends Alex Porter and
Charles “Bear” Smith, Frank Anderson and Paul Biggers
at tackle, Bob Stancil and Dale Gramley as guards, and
captain Bill Price at center.

Dole says there is no distinction between the two
teams with which he has been working and that both are
equal as far as he is concerned.

Wide Open Game Expected

Asked if he plans any new developments Dole re-
plied, ‘This year we plan to throw a little more in order
to open the game up. We were too stereotyped last

From his 18-strong bevy of promising freshmen Dole
singled out end Danny House, tackle Scott Lacy, guards
John Crute and Jim Smith, centers Harold Bynum and
Simpson, quarterback Redding, halfbacks Joe Cox and
Ned Davis, and fullback Russell Cotton.

Work in molding these various segments into
an operating team has been going smoothly. “We've
accomplished more at this stage of practice than at
any time since I’ve been here,” states Dole.

Catawba “Tough” Opener

“The boys have been working hard and show good
spirit.”’ Referring to the opener with the Catawba Indians
a week from tonight, Dole believes that Catawba “will be
tough. You know, they beat Wofford handily last year.
We're looking forward to a good season and will be all
right if the quarterback position shapes up.

With a veteran at every position except one,
we'll have to agree with Coach Dole. The boys have
a scrimmage here with Newberry tomorrow after-
noon. See you there.
