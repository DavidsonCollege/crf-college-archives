SGA Senate Disbands Unexp

In a_ surprise move last
Tuesday night, the SGA Senate
voted itself out of power by a
vote of 10-3-2.

Upon realizing the mistake,
Senate President Ralph Peeples
was ‘‘speechless’’ but vowed to
“work with all my power to
fight this issue."’

Unfortunately, the platform
under which the vote was taken
does not come up for recon-
sideration until late April, so
until that time the Senate will
remain idle.

The only problem is that with
all the back work left undone,
there are approximately 23
proposals to be considered
before the one on the Senate's
dissolution.

Therefore with no authority to
consider the other motions, and
no way to regain their lost power
before clearing through old
business, the Senate is in a
“puzzling position’’ as Senator
Bill Meier summed it up.

The mishap occured during a
normal discussion in which the
fate of the 12 ‘“‘legitimate’’
Young Republican groups was
being determined.

When favorable opinion
leaned toward not recognizing
the Republican Party at all,
Peeples intervened to say that
the Senators ‘‘had an obligation
to every member of the college
community, be they
Republicans or any other
misguided group,”’ and that he
was ‘‘disappointed in the
Senate's attitude.”

Bob Edmunds rallied to his
fellow senators’ aid and
shouted, ‘‘Who’s on trial here,
the SGA or Kaniklides?’’
Whereupon Rob Strand entered
the question into the record
and called for a vote.

Without realizing the mixup,
the SGA went on to win handily
12-10 from the Senate vote.
Steve Suflas in error over the
party in question, motioned for
a vote to oust the group being
discussed and to take away
their prerogative, thus causing
the present problem.

Freshmen Senators Steve
Bell, Mike Pappas and Jeff

Dehoff didn't know what they
were voting on but just ‘‘went
with what everybody else was
doing.’’ To them the parliamen-
tary procedure was so com-
plicated that ‘‘we thought the
roll call was still being taken, so
we put up our hands since we
were all there, I think,’’ said
Bell.

Quick to act however, Peeples
used what influence he still had

to appoint an ad hoc committee -

to study the possible alter-
natives to the problem.

Peeples said that this was the
‘last recourse’’, after referring
to such well-established sources
as ‘‘Robert’s Rules of Order’’,
‘‘Reader’s Digest Treasury of
Political Anecdotes’, ‘Fond
Memories of Congress’’ by
Calvin Coolidge, and ‘‘Catch

22.

After a lengthy statistical
evaluation on the dilemma’s
economic aspect in regard to
the Gross National Product
delivered by Senator Bob
Corlew, it was apparent that
factional strife had taken over.

Vince Rabil led a six man
walk-out from the scene, which
reduced the active members to

less than quorum number by
one third of a senator.

In a spirited gesture, which
was nevertheless considered
unconstitutional under the 8th
Ammendment about ‘‘cruel and
unusual punishments” Stéve
Canterbury offered to make up
the missing fracture and return
to active political life.

In final desperation, Senator
Sue Schmidt called for a simple
deletion of the mistake out of
the minutes, but was termed out
of order by the chair.

“It’s the students that are
going to suffer in consequence”’
sighed Senate Vice President
Bob Cunningham. “There are
sO many pressing issues that
have to be acted upon im-
mediately, that we really can’t
afford to let a thing like this
happen.”’ Cunningham could
not be reached for additional
comment because of a pressing
kazoo band engagement.

Indeed, Cunningham’s words
should not be taken lightly, as
evidenced by the weighty mat-
ters on future agendas.

For example, the issues in-
volved in Tuesday night's

College To Buy Flashlights For Lighting

Physical Plant Director
Grover Meetze revealed in an
interview Thursday, that the
college is about to implement’
Phase II of the campus lighting
program begun last spring.

“Phase II,"’ said Meetze,
consists of securing 1160
flashlights and instructing the
students in their proper use and
maintenance.

“After looking at all of the
alternatives, the Future Cam-
pus Lighting Committee
decided that this solution was
preferable to ruining the genial
night time atmosphere of the
campus with mercury-vapor
lighting,”’ added Meetze.

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell said, ‘I can sleep well at

PHASE Il ANNOUNCED
Students try out new flashlights.

night knowing that our students
will be safe and that we will be
Saving $45,000.

The $3 annual rent which the
students will pay for this ser-
vice is negligible in comparison
to the sense of well being that
they will gain.”’

Cornell denied reports that
the money saved will be used
for an activities limosine for ad-
ministration members.

Dean of Students Will Terry
said, ‘I think that this new in-
dividual lighting system
epitomizes the kind of personal
freedom which the college has
tried to develop during the
Davidson experience.

“These are fine flashlights
which will distinguish Davidson
graduates in yearstocome.” —

Asked if he was aware that
the college was planning to rent
the flashlights to students,
Terry replied, ‘‘I am aware that
this tightfisted idea was plan-
ned; however, Mr. Nicholls and
I worked out an alternative
which we think is acceptable.
The flashlights will be free and
batteries will be sold in the
Student Store for $2 each.”

- Consolidated Flashlight In-

ternational salesman I. P.
Freely said that two styles of
flashlights will be available to
students. “‘There is our rugged
‘Mountaineer’ style for the men
with its simulated rhinocerous

i handle and our ‘Eve’
model for the girls with its
— carrying case and pink

Freely went on to describe
the wide variety of accessories
which are available: a wall
mounting bracket which turns
the flashlight into a “‘spiffy”’
study lamp, a fine line of Greek
monogram letters, and a con-
version kit which turns the
flashlight into an innocent
looking tear gas dispenser.

Freely pointed out that since
Davidson College is buying

more than 1,000 flashlights,
each student will receive a free
copy of ‘‘The New 1973
Flashlight Handbook” which in-
cludes the suggested manner
for holding your light in heavy
fog, flashlight courtesy rules,
and many other helpful
techniques.

“These flashlights are the
final word in security ,"’ Meetze

said. ‘‘They have a high inten-
sity beam and are great for
busting heads in a tight spot like
we all get into once in a while.

“Like any fine precision in-
strument, these flashlights need
occasional maintenance. Above
all, remember ‘Take good care
of your flashlight and your
flashlight will take good care of
you,” Meetze suggested.

Davidson Discards
Subsidized Sports

This may be the last year that
Davidson College plays major
college subsidized athletics.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. made clear his in-
tention today to recommend
that the trustees put a ‘“mer-
ciful and humane end’’ to all
athletic scholarships beginning
next year.

The Trustees are expected to
pass the motion in the Spring,
and the machinery for football
and basketball recruiting will
be phased out by the end of this
year.

Spencer said that students
presently enrolled in the college
on athletic scholarships would
be allowed to finish their four
years, provided all usable Pro
Keds and unravelled jock
straps be given back upon
graduation.

Spencer went on to say that
all the recruits for both basket-
ball and football that have
signed for next year would not
be eligible for what he termed
“privi money”, and would
be immediately sent home on
the first outbound Trailways
bus after they arrive in the Fall.

‘“‘It was simply unfeasible for
us to keep up a competitive
program,’’ Spencer said. ‘‘It
costs a lot more to run a school
now than it did in the heyday of
Davidson athletics, and we need

the cold cash.’’ Spencer
recalled the “heyday” to be
somewhere in the vicinity of the
Spring of 1908 and the Winter of
1909.

“It’s about time we stopped
deluding ourselves,” he con-
tinued. ‘‘We haven’t been able
to compete with the bigger
schools for a long time. Let’s
face it, Lees-McRae, Guilford
and Lenoir-Rhyne have been
out of our league for years.”’

‘“‘I am really pleased with the
new decision,’’ added Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan. “It was the
most logical move for a school
like Davidson to make. Now to
get to work on the 4-1-4.””

Assistant Basketball Coach
Bo Brickels offered to help
Bevan on the 4-1-4, saying that
beating new defenses was his
specialty and that since he was
out of an athletic job could con-
centrate on the problem full
time. Bevan did not reply.

Reactions in the athletic of-
fices themselves’ varied
greatly, from a brief drunken ©
stint by Tom Scott, director of
athletics, to Bob Mosketti
throwing flaming football films
out his third story office win-
dow.

have imagined,"’ Head Football
