Students agitating for no Saturday
classes might do well to consider the Da-
vidson of the turn-of-the-century. In those
days, there were no classes on Monday.

The college’s religious commitment,
Stronger then than now, was the reason
for the seemingty strange schedule, ac-
cording to one who remembers.

co a

Said Walter S. Henderson, a Davidson
watchmaker and member of the Class
of ‘12:

“There were no Monday classes so
that boys who messed around on Satur-
days wouldn't feel pressed to study on
Sunday."

Instead, literary society meetings and
é labs were held on Monday. The five day
work week began on Tuesday.

A half a century has brought change
and progress to Davidson. Henderson
said, but one student occupation has re-
mained the same: the quest for female
companionship.

Even in the early 1900's Davidson stu-
dents ‘‘scoured the country" for girls.
That they. were often successful. is ob-
vious from the number of marriages to
girls from North Carolina. Henderson
said.

THE YEARS BRING CHANGES
Henderson watches Davidson‘s progress.

In 1912: Sacred Sunday '
And No Monday Classes

Henderson, an elderly gentleman with |
a thatch of white hair and an ever-pres-
ent pipe. has owned and operated Hen-
derson’s Jewelers in downtown Davidson
for almost 50 years.

His interest in watches dates back to
his boyhood, when his father, a Presby-
terian minister, moved his family to
Davidson. After school and on Saturdays.
Henderson worked for a local jeweler.

In his student days. Henderson studied
chemistry and was a member of the
Philanthropic Literary Society and a
monitor at chapel and church.

In those days stud-nts were required
to attend an 11 a.m. service at the col-
lege church. Said Henderson: ‘Some
griped. but it never hurt them.”

Reflecting on over 50 years’ observa-
tion of the college. Henderson had words
of praise for the ROTC program and. the
proposed curriculum changes.

A new curriculum, he said. will help
alleviate the problems caused by ‘‘the
sorry job grammar schools and high
schools do in preparing students for col-
lege.”*

He pointed to the number of David-
son graduates who have gone on. to
“high offices in the Army” as a good
reason for continuing ROTC.

Investigating Committee

Not Negligent — Newsom

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Buddy Newsom. chairman
of the Investigating Commit.
tee for the Student Body Reg.
ulations Court. answered
charges that his committee
was neglecting its duty at
the Tuesday meeting of the
Student Council.

After the meeting got off
to a late start because of the
absence of several cuuncil
members, Newsom said that
he was present ‘‘only to clari-
fy the charges by Bill Watson
that my committee had not
investigated several cases re-
ferred to us by Watson.”

Newsom said that to his
knowledge he had failed to
investigate only one case,

Faculty
To Meet.
On ROTC

The faculty will probably
meet the last week before
Christmas vacation to con
sider the section of the Blue
Sky Report dealing with
ROTC, a member of the fac-
ulty said, Wednesday.

The date of the meeting
-is dependent on two factors:
the scheduled absence of
President D. Grier Martin
from campus all next week
and the necessity of meeting
before the scheduled trustee
meeting Dec. 20.

Consideration of the por
tion of the Blue Sky Report
was originally delayed be
cause of the absence of Col.
Frederick Outlaw. professor
of military science. Outlaw
was unable to attend the
meeting during which the
faculty passed the rest of
the report.

The Blue Sky Committee
has recommended that ROTC
be made voluntary for the
first two years,- and that no
academic credit be given for
the first two years.

For Lingle Manor Building

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

The future of the recently
abandoned Lingle Manor |
building will be determined
by the Freshman Council.

The Student Council turned
the problem over to the fresh-
men after the Lingle Manor
group disbanded two weeks
ago and transferred its treas-
ury and facilities to the Stu-
dent Council.

3

Freshman Council Presi-
dent Steve Engstrom said
that a committee has been
appointed to study the situa.
tion and that it will present a
report at the next meeting of
the Freshman Council on
Monday.

One.of the ideas the com- .
mittee is considering is to

STEVE ENGSTROM
.» “no half-way house’

the house was not to be used
as a “half way house” where
those freshmen not yet in
fraternities could center their
social Hfe. Rather it would be
primarily intended as a late-
night study area.

Engstrom said, ‘‘The pos
sibilities for its use are limit-
less. It would be a_ place
where freshmen can _ bring
their dates between concerts
and a Union combo party.

“It would be especially nice
because it has a home-like
atmosphere. Since it would
be open to everyone. not just
the freshmen, it could be a
place where we could meet
people,’’ said Engstrom.

“We want to emphasize
that it won't be called Lingle
Manor any more. We also

make the house into an all.
night study house. There
would be meeting rooms and
a television room downstairs
which might include vending
machines for hot and cold
drinks and sandaviches.

The upstairs would be di-
vided into typing and study

rooms similar to those in the
library. The building could
also be used as housing for
freshman dates during dance
weekends.

At Wednesday's Student
Council meeting, Engstrom
made it clear, though, that

want to emphasize that it
won't be the same old place
with a new name: it will be
a@ new place with a new at-
mosphere."

The building. which was
donated to the college a
number of years ago. was
taken over by the Lingle

Manor group when it. first
formed in 1962.

Membership in the original
group was about 50; but when
Lingle Manor formally dis
banded itself two weeks ago
membership had shrunk to
six.

due to a breakdown in com-
munication between his com-
mittee and the Student Body
Regulations Court.

Watson. chairman of the
court, was not present to an-.
swer this statement; but said
afterwards that he ‘‘felt.sure
I had reported. several
cases to Newsom upon which
no action was taken.”

Newsom said he would try
to alleviate this communica-
tion problem by asking Mrs.
Peter Nicholls. director of
student housing. to report
cases directly to him in the
future. He also asked that
members of the court be
more understanding in their
attitude toward the commit-
tee.

Newsom's action was
prompted by the charges
made against his committee
in a letter sent to all its
members by the council. The
letter alleged that the In-
vestigating Committee had
failed to investigate several
cases.

The letter also drew a re-
sponse from Steve Humph-
rey, another member of the
committee, who asked the
council to accept his resigna-
tion from the committee ‘‘be-
cause of a lack of time."

The council accepted his
resignation and will appoint a
new member next week.

Newsom also.
that the council consult the
Investigating Committee in
the future whenever they are
considering changing any dor-
mitory rules, He said he
thought, for example, that a
stricter fire rule would be
difficult to enforce.

Freshman Steve Engstrom
recommended that the council

suggested.

continue its project. of spon
soring political speakers next
spring by inviting either
George Wallace. former gov.
ernor of Alabama, or Orville
Faubus, former governor of
Arkansas, to speak at David-
son. ;

He said these men could
give the student body their
third party points of view.

The council voted down a
proposal from Queens Col

Students To Get
Better Seating

By CHUCK GREEN
Staff Writer

Location of student seating
for basketball games in the
Charlotte Coliseum. often a
source of gripes in the past.
will be much improved this
year, Student Council Presi-
dent Tom Earnhardt said
yesterday.

Student concern for better
seats and the desire of Coach
Lefty Driesell ‘to have the
student body closer to the
team,"" he said, prompted
Athletic Director Tom Scott.
to provide a new arrange.
ment.

The Student Council re-
quested early this fall that
better seats be given stu-
dents, and “Dr. Scott agreed
with us."’ Earnhardt said.
“Due to his full co-operation.
the Student Council passed
on the plan around the first of
October.”

Scott said Wednesday that
students would be given. the

reserved for the top college
publications.

issues for the second semes
ter of last year marked the
12th time in the last 14 se
mesters that THE DAVID
SONIAN has captured the top
award.

On a 4.000 point scale, with

THE DAVIDSONIAN scored
3,840.

Coverage, content and phy
sical properties are the major
areas evaluated by the ACP.

ed near perfect rankings in
all three categories. Editor
ials, photography, style. lay
out and creativity were the
specific areas that were high
lv commended by the ACP.
The critical service also
praised the feature, -news
and sports coverage.

Shorter leads. avoidance of
unnecessary detail and the
deletion of trite expressions
from the copy were among
the recommendations of the ‘
ACP.

Proposed Fire Rule To Go
To Student Vote Tuesday

A student body vote on the
proposed stricter rule against
dormitory fires will be held
next. Tuesday, Student Body
Regulations Court Chairman
Bill Watson revealed after
chapel yesterday.

Watson said that the rule
had two purposes:-to protect
students’ lives and to protect
college property.

“The reason for the rule is
simply to underline the ser-
iousness of building any kind
of fire in the dormitories,”
said Tom Earnhardt, presi.

dent of the Student Council.

“We aren't talking about
hot plates, or popcorn pop.
pers or any other appliances.
We're talking about ‘fun
fires," the ones built with
paper or lighter fluid. This
kind of ‘fun’ just can't con-
tinue,”” Earnhardt said.

The rule, which will be an
‘amendment to Article IX,
Section 5, of the Student Body
Constitution if passed by the
required two-thirds vote of
the student body. reads:

“The intentional setting of

a fire in any building on cam
pus will be considered an ex-
treme case, and conviction
for such an offense will usual
ly result in suspension for no
less than one semester."

Earnhardt mentioned the.
damage done to Richardson
Dormitory last year as proof
of the need for such a rule.

The stronger rile was first
recommended last month by
the faculty Student Life Com-
mittee. The Student Council
has also endorsed the meas-
ure.

“parquet seats—the first
rows of elevated seats on the
floor of the Coliseum—‘‘the
best seats in the house.” All
parquet seats on one side will
be available, he said. and all
but a few on the other side,
too.

Earnhardt said, ‘‘For stu-
dents who like the bird's-eye
view, there will be two high
sections reserved, too. There
will be more seats than last
year, and there should be
plenty of seats for students
and dates at every game."

Scott said it would be ‘bet:
ter for the team and better
for the students to be around
the court to make plenty of
racket.”

“I hope the new situation
will be an assét.”’ Driesell
said. “I suggested that the
students be given the best
seats with the hope that their
cheering will be heard more
by the players. I hope they
yell, holler and support us.”
He and Earnhardt said they
hoped the new’ seats would
produce a “home court” ef
fect in the Coliseum.

Earnhardt reéported that a
few businesses had complain.
ed that the best seats were
not available to them as gifts
to customers, hut that Scott
had supported the students.

Scott said ticket sales were
“brisk"’ and that four home
games will be televised.

Student Body Will Get
Constitution Dec. 11

Rights
Section
Undone

By DICK ANDERSON
Staff Writer

The Student Council Consti-

tution Revision Committee .

will present the new Student
Constitution to the Student
Council and student body by
Monday, Dec. 11, according
to Mike Bates, chairman of
the committee.

Bates said Wednesday that
except for the bill of rights
and a few more details the
constitution is complete. He
added that the committee
would have an open meeting
for questions from students.

“We want the constitution
in time for the spring elec-
tions and if we don’t get it out
before Christmas, we will
run into rush week, exams,
etc.,”’ said Franklin Ander-
son, a committee member.

He expressed the hope that
the constitution might be
voted on before the end of
the semester.

The committee was set up
last semester after elections,
since most of the newly elect-
ed Student Council members
had run on platforms calling
for revision of the constitu-
tion.

Bates noted that the group
had planned to deal with the
bill of rights at the Tuesday
night meeting. but that the
special. subcommittee on the
bill of rights. of which Flet-
cher Hartsell is chairman,
had been unable to report at
that time.

A student Senate to replace
the present Student Council
is one of the provisions of the
hew constitution. The Senate
would have 23 members elect-
ed from the student body,
with additional non voting
members chosen by the sena.
tors, A 5- to 7 member exe-
cutive committee is also in-
cluded in the plan.

The constitutional revision
was necessary because of
complaints about the present
Student Body Constitution.
