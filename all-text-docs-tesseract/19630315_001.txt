BILL PRIDGEN

Bill Pridgen, the Sports Edi-
tor of THE DAVIDSONIAN, is
a history major from Myrtle
Beach, S. C. A member of Beta
Theta Pi and a varsity wrestler,
Pridgen is also a member of
Alpha Phi Omega service fra-
ternity, and Phi Eta Sigma fresh-
man scholastic fraternity.

THE DAVIDSONIAN, to
deserve the caption, “The
News and Editorial Voice of
Davidson College,” has a
dual responsibility, in its
news reporting and its edi-
torial policy. I do not be-
lieve that either of these re-

sponsibilities have been
adequately fulfilied in the
past year.

Adequate and accurate infor-
mation is essential to any news-
paper—to this end all reporting
and editorial inquiry should be
directed. All too often, how-
ever, THE DAVIDSONIAN has
published stories lacking ade-
quate information through care-
less reporting. The “new objec-
tivity” called for this year
has never been fully realized. A
news story is a news story and
must be completely devoid of
all editorializing.

On the editorial page full and
complete knowledge of a sub-
ject is even more important. A
strong editorial stand is neces-
sary, but it should be based as
little as possible on personal
bias, and as much as possible on
sufficient facts.

It is impossible to state a
clearcut platform of positions
that I intend to take on all is-
sues, since they will depend to
a large extent on the context in
which. these issues arise, but
there are several major policies
that I will carry out if elected.

First, there will be a continu-
ing re-evaluation of Davidson
as it really is—not the picture
presented by the administration,
but the picture as facts warrant
it. Editorials will be used in
conjunction with Walt Mac-

Donald's recently begun series.

concerning the position David-
son really occupies in relation
to other schools.

Tradition serves an important
role in any school like David-
son. Too often, however, a tradi-
tion-minded school is apt to re-
sist changes even when the
existing situation is out of con-
formity with reality.

The editorials in this ser-
ies will point out where tradi-
tion is outworn and change is
needed. Necessary and con-
structive changes will also be
recommended to bring col-
lege rules and policies in con-
formity with the existing
situation.

By more accurate and detailed
reporting, a greater emphasis
on facts in both news stories
and editorials and an active edi-
torial platform designed to pro-
mote the interests of the major-
ity of students at Davidson, !
hope to make THE DAVIDSON-
IAN a more vital, integral, and
better read part of student life.

BILL RUTH

Presently the Asistant Edi-
tor of THE DAVIDSONIAN, Bill
Ruth is a pre-medical major
from Jacksonville, Fla. Ruth
also serves as Editor of all
Alpha Tau Omega social frater-
nity publications and is a
member of the Philanthropic
Literary Society.

THE DAVIDSONIAN pres-
ently suffers from what we
might term the “apathy
syndrome.” The _ writers
don’t care what they write.
The students don’t care
what the writers write. The
Editor doesn’t care what the
writers write. And the writ-
ers don’t care what the Edi-
tor writes. The whole mal-
ady seems to stem from the
fact that THE DAVIDSON-
IAN has become out of
touch with student opinion.

Unfortunately, THE DAVID-
SONIAN has become wrapped
up in its own opinions and has
lost all sense of objectivity.
News stories are opinionated
and features are rarely unbias-
ed. In an attempt to put life in
the Paper, writers have even
gone so far as to misquote visit-
ing lecturers or put words in
their mouths.

Well, it is easy to criticize, but
just what can be done?

I think the first move must be
to draw DAVIDSONIAN opin-
ion closer to student opinion.
Issues such as the. Drinking
Rule, fraternity parties and
compulsory chapel and vespers
attendance will surely be
brought before faculty com-
mittees again next year.

if any progress is to be
made at afl along these lines,
THE DAVIDSONIAN must
conscienciously express stud-
ent opinion to the administra-
tion. There is a need for stud-
ent unity on these points
which can only be brought
ebout by a combined endeav-
or of the Student Council and
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Secondly, the editor must take

a more active part in the pro...

duction of the Paper. He must
read all of the copy before it is
printed. It is his imagination
and creativity which can add
interest to the paper.

Thirdly, I think that the edi-
torials, the features and the
news stories must be guided by
several essential elements:
logic, fairness, truth and es-
pecially a sense of pride in put-
ting together a newspaper
which is not just four pages
filled with print; but rather,
factual news reporting, objec-
tive and interesting features,
full sports coverage, and most
important, a relevant editorial
voice.

Bultrick To Speak
At Tuesday Chapel

The speaker for chapel on
Tuesday will be George A. But-
rick, clergyman, author, and
lecturer. Buttrick has appeared
at Davidson a number of times
in the past and was Otts Lectur-
er in 1956.

Aside from holding degrees
from a number of universities,

THE DAVIDSONIAN has:
two principal functions. |
First, to report fully and ac-'
curately news pertinent to
the college, and secondly, to
maintain a coherent editor-
ial policy.

The first of these functions, ,
reporting news, represents quite
a problem for a weekly news- .

paper at a small liberal arts
school like Davidson. The news
must be reported objectively
and in full, but the news stories
themselves must be readable
and interesting before anyone
is going to read them. The prob-
lem here is, simply, that stories
about dull events tend to be
dull.

One solution would be to
write only about the more in-
teresting aspects of campus
life, but unfortunately THE
DAVIDSONIAN cannot come out
every week with half-empty
pages. This leaves one alterna-
tive, which I think is not only
possible, but necessary if this
newspaper is ever to become
readable, and that is to concen-
trate on improving the journalis-
tic talents of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN reporters.

Many of the news stories that
came in to the newspaper this
year would hardly have done
credit to a grammar school pub-
lication, and not only were they
printed, but precious little was
done to correct the situation.

t€ elected editor of THE

DAVIDSONIAN, | intend to
set up a “grading ” system
whereby the editor and as-
sociate editor rate each news
article that is printed, and
then return it to the author
with written suggestions as to
how the reporter can improve
his writing.

As for the editorial policy of

THE DAVIDSONIAN, too many
superfluous editorials have been
written this year merely to fill
up the left hand side of the
editorial page. Some weeks the
newspaper would have been bet-
ter off had it run no editorials,
while other editions could easily
have carried as many as four
well-written, pertinent editor-
ials. Greater discretion in print-
ing editorials would also facili-
tate the formation of an editor-
ial point of view, which is a
vital part of any newspaper.

In summary, the incoming
editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN
will have to undertake the goal
of improving the quality of both
news stories and editorials if
THE DAVIDSONIAN is to merit
the slogan “The News and Edi-
torial Voice of Davidson Col-
lege.” If elected editor, I will
pursue this goal.

Thin Air Receives Views
Of Presidential Candidates

BY BOB ADAMS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Speeches will be given in
assembly on Monday by the
YMCA presidential candi-

Candidate Jerry Trammell’s plea for active student participation in Student
Council affairs literally echoed from the walls of an empty room during the student-
candidate forum held Monday night.

Only eight students sat oppo-
site the three presidential candi-

dates at that time candidates

when had anticipated being chal-
lenged by the more radical pro-
ponents of the “improve David-

son movement.”

Although the audience swell-
ed to a maximum of 27 at one

time during the forum, no ques-

tions were heard from students

who have so recently campaign-

ed to ban the faculty oath and to
ban the drinking rule.

Instead, the questions con-

cerned interests ranging from

the waning dramatics program

to possible changes in cut

policy for athletes playing

spring sports,

Before the candidates submit-
ted to facing questions from the
floor, however, they presented
their opinions of what the coun-
ci] could best accomplish under
their prospective leadership.

Some of the ideas represent-
ed mutual feeling, especially
those concerning student-facul-
ty relationship. All candidates
believed that “communications”
could be improved here, al-
though they didn’t outline speci-
fically their methods.

Bjoerling, Tenor,
Next Series Artist

Davidson’s next Artist Series
concert will feature Rolf Bjoerl-
ing, tenor. The concert will be
in Chambers Auditorium on
Friday, March 22 at 8:15 p.m.

Rolf Bjoerling is the son of
Jussi Bjoerling, recognized a
decade ago as the world’s lead-
ing tenor. Having been widely
praised in Europe (“A Great
Father's Great Son—He Came,
Sang, and Conquered,” wrote
Nyheter, of Copenhagen), Bjoer!-
ing is presently making his first
tour in the United States.

Dealing with the problem of
student participation in coun-
cil activities, Trammell would
improve Haison by conduct-
ing student forums during
chapel peried.

Certainly the attendance prob-
lem associated with the volun-
tary forum would cease. On the
other hand, the vociferous
cough clique might easily negate
the advantages of a large meet-
ing.

Another problem, the reality
of organized disrespect, brought
not only comments from Danny
Carrell at assembly Monday, but
also a question before the can.
didate’s forum: “Should vespers
be policed?”

Trammell replied that the
council shouldn’t favor rowdy-
ism, but, at the same time, it
shouldn't have to act as a police
force. John Spratt quickly
countered that as representa-
tives in a legislature, the coun-
cil members should act to en-
force student body regulations.
Just how he would establish a
council police was not decided.

A council police force,

though, might be used to en-
force the present drinking
rule. Trammell again opposed
the police ides. He personally
did not faver any move which
would eliminate the drinking
(regulation because any at-
tempt by the student body to
remove drinking restrictions
would lead, in Trammell’s
opinion, to more rigid enforce-
ment of the rule.

Fred McGuirt, taking a dif-
ferent approach in his platform,
believed that more problems
would be solved than spread if
fraternities were able to obtain
permission to hold cocktail
parties as off-campus functions.

Surprisingly enough, the can-
didates’ positions on the drink-
ing rule did not dominate the
forum discussion; rather, the

fees next year, we should try to
present two outstanding pro-
grams during the year, thus at-
tracting Charlotteans and realiz-
ing profits from ticket sales.

In addition to standing be-
hind the dramatics program
and Artist Series, the candi-
dates would delight those who
would make Davidson the
“Princeton of the South.” In
order to discover curriculum
deficiencies, McGuirt would
conduct an evaluation through
questionnaires issued by each
department. Spratt would
move more directly to estab-
lish an independent reading
program as used by Rutgers
and other Ivy schools.

Re-evaluation of freshman reg-
ulations, a brief study break be-
fore exams, and plans for af-
filiation with the National Stud-
ent Association were some other
ideas presented by the candi-
dates. These ideas merited the
implicit approval of the few
students attending the forum.

It remains to be seen how
many of the ideas presented by
all of the candidates together
will be used by next year’s
council.

dates. They are Joe Howell
and Doug Heidt.

Howell, a member of Beta
Theta Pi, is presently serving on
the YMCA board. He is active in
the Vagabonds. Heidt is from
Clearwater, Fla., and is studying
for the ministry. He is a mem-

ber of Sigma Phi Epsilon frater- ,

nity,

Rick Brand, Steve David-
son, and George Ochler—all
rising juniors—have been
nominated for vice-president
of the YMCA.

Steve Gill and Doug Woodworth;
for treasurer, John Good and
Hank Taylor. The nominees for
secretary and treasurer are all
rising sophomores.

This year for the first time,
the entire student body will
elect the president of the
Student Union. Nominated by
the Union board are Charlie
Shaperd, Staff Warren, and
George Worthen.

Shapard, a member of Phi
Gamma Delta, is presently serv-
ing as vicetpresident of the
Student Union. He is a cheer-
leader and is majoring in social
sciences.

Warren, a Dana Scholar, is a
member of Phi Delta Theta fra-
ternity. He is a member of
Alpha Phi Omega service frater-
nity and is majoring in psycho-
logy.

Kappa Phi, is majoring in eco-
nomics. He is the Pi Kappa Phi
representative to the IFC.

Voting for members of the
Honer Court, which began on
Thursday, will continue into
next week. Each class selects
two representatives, who serve
on the court until graduation.

Rising seniors Roy Alexander,
Bob Dixon, and Dave Lopp will
enter a third run-off on Monday.
They survived an original field
of 19 candidates. Dixon led to-
day's voting with 40 votes; he
was followed by Lopp with 32
and Alexander with 28.

Mac Mays, Ted Pulliam, Ron-
nie Reese, Fred Sackett, and
Bruce Swain are the rising
juniors who still remain from
the 28 first-day aspirants. Sac-
kett barely led the group today
with 31 votes; following him
were Reese with 30, Pulliam
with 25, and Mays and Swain
with 23 apiece.

From a large group of 36 ris-
ing sophomores on the first day,
only four are still in the race.
Jim Stokes led the survivors
with 40 votes; close behind him
were Britt Snider with 31, Joe
Davis with 27, and Chip Sanders
with 25.

The two contests between the
rising seniors and rising sopho-
mores will definitely be decided
on Monday; however, the third
contest may go into a fourth

run-off on Tuesday.

the following: rising seniors—
Alton Brown, Reese Coppage,
Joe Howell, Bob King, Monty
Mayes, Andy Sale, and Bruce
Steigner; rising junior—Larry
Compton; rising sophomores—

Library Acquires
‘Breeches’ Bible

The Davidson College Library
has recently supplemented its
rare book collection with the
addition of a seventeenth-cen-
tury Breeches Bible.

Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson, di-
rector of the library, and Dr.
W. P. Cumming, who aids the
library in its quest for rare
books, are pleased with the suc-
cess of efforts made to secure
the Bible for the library. Its
acquisition was made possible
through the efforts of Dr.
Charles B. Sanders, class of ‘22,
who is director of the Sanders
Diagnostic Clinic in Houston,
Texas.

The Breeches Bible, also
known as the Genevan Bible,
appeared in its first edition in
1560. The most significant dis-
tinction from other translations
and the reason for its name are
found in the third chapter of the
book of Genesis. The seventh
verse in this translation is as
follows: “And the eyes of them
both were opened, and they
knew that they were naked; and
they sewed fig leaves together,
and made themselves breeches.”
In other translations, generally,
the word “aprons” is used in-
stead of “Breeches.”

This translation became very
popular during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Be-
cause of this, 140 editions were
printed between 1560 and 1644.,
It was thought that the copy
received .by the Davidson Col-
lege Library was a first edition,
published in 1560; however, it
has been discovered that the
copy on the campus was printed
in London in 1614.

He has recently signed a con-
tract with the Berlin Symphony
Orchestra. After his United
States debut in the “Messiah”
a critic said, ‘Rolf Bioerling did
not belie the illustrious name he
bears, and delighted his hearers
with a rich, clear tenor voice of
wide range and considerable
power.”
