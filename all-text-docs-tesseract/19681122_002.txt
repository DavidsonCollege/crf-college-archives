Before You Leap

The report of the Five-Year Plan
Committee, released last week, should
be received by the college with com-
mendations—and some caution.

The committee’s goal of admitting
disadvantaged students into a specially
designed program is a recognition of
the college’s long-ignored duty. For
Davidson can no longer serve _ its
Christian commitment unless it opens
its facilities to a wide range of stu-
dents.

But then again, for Davidson to
plunge into such a program without
realizing its complexity might well be
disastrous. At least one school has
apparently acted without care in this
matter, and now it is suffering the
consequences. ;

In an article published this week in
The Christian Science Monitor. for in-
stance, a midwest educator said:

“We wanted more black students,
so we went out and got them. But,
frankly, we didn’t anticipate the chal-
lenges. On the academic side, cer-
tainly, we knew remedial work would
be required for many of them. This
we planned for. But the ramifications
of cultural and socio-economic differ-
ences, extreme racial sensitivity . . .

and an emerging separatist movement ©

—these we did not anticipate, and they
have compelled a searching re-evalua-
tion of the purpose and direction of
our educational policy.”

The article went on to say that
while many universities have adjusted
to the changes, “liberal arts colleges,
which tend to be smaller and to main-
tain high standards for admission and
graduation, find adjustment difficult.”

But. the rewards for liberal arts col-
leges can be greater than for large
universities, too.

According to the article, disadvan-
taged students sometimes resent reme-
dial counseling, because it singles

That Night

Davidson, haunted by the specter of
a medieval night watchman strolling
the campus, tolling his bell and crying
“Twelve o’clock and all’s well,” main-
tains a curfew tradition appropriate
to far more feudal institutions.

The Davidson student has now
achieved some sort of status as a re-
sponsibile individual, or so we are told
by the Code of Responsibility. We are
supposed to be able to take care of
ourselves now.

But though we may be men of re-
sponsibility we are not paragons of
virtue, at least not. in the eyes of the
administration. Fraternity house cur-
fews are maintained, two couples are
required at all times, and open dorms
are restricted.

The unspoken reason behind these
flights of authoritarian fancy seems
to be administration fear of student
fornication on campus—not with each
other, of course, but with women
visitors.

This old myth deserves to be laid
to eternal rest.

The influence of the college on the
sexua] mores of students is nil, The
only influence the college has at-
tempted to exert in this area is the

them out as inferior. Some schools
provide no such program. But many
of them suffer high attrition rates.
This failure to compete is the one
thing a disadvantaged student does not
need to gain from his college exper-
ience.

One way to overcome this might be
to single out high school students and
prepare them for admission before
they finish their secondary education.
The University of Rochester has begun
such a program, and officials there
estimate the cost of such training for
35 to 50 students will be about $30,Q00
a year.

Also. we wonder how Davidson
would adjust to a large subculture in
its midst. Most schools which have
admitted large numbers of Negroes
have experienced a separatist move-
ment and many students familiar with
this question expect one to develop
here.

Can a small college like Davidson
survive with a fragmented student
body? How long would it take before

meaningful communication developed -

between the groups? Would the
groups merely room side-by-side, or
would they eventually really live to-
gether in the most meaningful sense
of the word?

We salute those with the vision to
tackle these problems. But we hope
their vision will be sharpened by the
experience of other colleges, and by
a_ realization of Davidson’s nature.
This is not Cornell, nor even Antioch.
Success there might not insure success
here.

Admitting large numbers of minor-
ity groups would revolutionize this in-
stitution, and would probably add to
its academic stature. But to see what

-the Davidson of the five-year plan

would look like requires a hard look
at the Davidson of the present first.

Watchman

curfew and open dorm restrictions.
If the college is so concerned, it should
seek chapel speakers who actually
have something to say on the subject.

Davidson will not become a haven
of immorality and licentiousness if the
curfew and open dorm restrictions are
ended. It would have no effect on the
sexual behavior of students, for if
students and their dates want to have

sexual intercourse, they can find many

more romantic opportunities than a
narrow bed in a crowded dorm room
or a couch in. a fraternity house base-
ment.

It is hypocritical of the college to
maintain these regulations without
admitting their rather childish pur-
pose.

The irrelevancy of the rules was
demonstrated at a recent meeting of
student leaders and President Spen-
cer. The matter of the curfew came
up, and Dr. Spencer confessed he was
unfamiliar with it. When he asked for
details, the students were hard pressed
to supply them.

It is past time that these antiquated
rules were done away with. We can
get along without the moral guidance
of the night watchman.

Ignoring The Bylaws

We've heard the old saying that
rules are made to be broken, but the
student Senate is beginning to go too
far in its glaring violations of the by-
laws. Either our Senators have not
familiarized themselves with the rules
which they passed only this fall, or
else they just don’t mind disobeying
them.

Those students who spent a lot of
time drawing up the bylaws had a
purpose for everything they included
—purposes which in some cases the
Senate seems to be oblivious of.

Take the executive committee, for
instance. It is supposed to prepare an
agenda for each Senate meeting. Un-
til recently, the executive committee
did not even meet, and the agenda
was apparently a haphazard list drawn
up by President Joe Murphy. The exe-
cutive committee is also charged with
the responsibility of appointing mem-
bers to various committees, but so far
the entire Senate has been doing it
instead.

The chancellor is another position
which could be more effectively used.
His job is to do all the ‘“‘busy work”
of the Senate—that is, seeing that all
committee reports are answered, and
that everything is prepared for each
Senate meeting. He is also a non-

voting member of the Senate and can
speak out on. any issue. Apparently,
however, the present chancellor does
not realize the full extent of his
powers.

There have been numerous other
smaller violations of the bylaws. The
committee system has not been em-
ployed effectively. Committee reports
have not come in on time, and no one
has been fined for excessive absences,
although some members have ex-
ceeded their limit. The minutes have
often not contained the text of Senate
resolutions and the voting records of
the various members are not kept,
except in rare cases.

The list goes on. The oudget was not
published before it was approved by
the Senate. Every change in the by-
laws has not been read to the student
body before it was approved. In fact,
no changes at all have been read at an
assembly, to our knowledge. Finally,
the Senate recently elected two mem-
bers to non-existent positions on the
Social Council.

Last year we wanted a new student
body constitution because the old one
was inadequate and perverted. Now
it’s the Senate which is inadequate
and is perverting the new constitu-
tion.

LE TTERS TO THE EDI TOR
Juniors Belittle ‘Gentlemen’;

Cross Sees Problems For Nixon

To The Editor:

° A correction js in order. In
last week‘s DAVIDSONIAN
the preliminary report of the
Five-Year Plan Committee
follows the headline, ‘‘David-
son: ‘A Hiding Place From
Society's Frustrations. "'
This accusation was refuted
partially during Tuesday's
assembly.

“Peace Pilgrim,”
trian. at-large for brotherhood
and the olive branch, was
asked, in no uncertain terms,
to join the ranks of Gert
Behanna and other such no-
torious speakers.

Amidst spurts of guffaws.
‘snickers and riotous ap-
plause, she attempted to tell
her story. One of thuse weir-
dos who has a cause and
lives by her beliefs, she has
shown concern about people
and walked over 25,000 miles
to talk with them. And then
dared to walk into Love
Auditorium to talk about if.

When asked by the chap-
lain about the response she
had received, she comment-
ed only by saying that David-
son has an ‘“‘unusual group-
ing. of students."’ She has
been introduced to David-
son's own brand of academic
snobbishness, a disease
which prevents display of
common courtesy or re-
cognition of genuineness in
anyone as sincere as '*Peace
Pilgrim.”

“Peace Pilgrim’’ is amus-
ing. Her comment that stu-

pedes .

dents can spot a phony any
time caused a good stir of
laughter. Yet she is also
perceptive. From the stage.
she could not fail to see boys
réleasing some sort of frus-
tration. Student reaction to
her was certainly not hidden,
and that is the sad thing. The

“Davidson gentleman” could
only laugh at anyone so fool.
ish to be sincere and admit
it.

And who's the phony?

‘Pilgrim’ Chapel Manifests

Moral Indifference-Poland

To The Editor:

I was disappointed, but not
surprised, at the reception
given the assembly speaker
by the audience at chapel
Tuesday.

Though admittedly the
Peace Pilgrim’s unorthodox
appearance and animated
gestures did inspire whole-
some laughter at first sight.
the disrespect and ridicule to
which the speaker was sub
jected during the whole per-
iod was understandably cruel
to a person of. sincere re-
ligious convictions as is she.

I talked with Peace Pil:
grim privately after her
speech, and I was ashamed
to hear her say tha: in her
travels all over the country
she had never boen given
such a hostile and disconcert-
ing reception as that she had
experienced at Davidson.

Peace Pilgrim was warm.
ly received by a small num-
ber of interested students at
a voluntary coffee hour after

chapel. The aversion gen-
erally encountered by Peace
Pilgrim at. Davidson, how-
ever, was significant and
could be attributed to several
factors: Most Davidson stu-
dents had no idea such a
person even existed, much
less that she would speak to
them at chapel, and they
were totally unprepared
when she spontaneously ap-
peared before them at the
podium.

On the other hand, per-
haps this incident is just one
more indictment of compul-
sory chapel, where the un-
interested are foreed to at
tend buf not to be attentive.

However, a closer scrutiny
of the students’ unabashed
laughter during a_ serious
spiritual testimony reveals
something significant about
the “‘spirtual life’ at David-
son College.

In a college supposedly de.

dicated to “the development.

of men of human instincts,”

it was disturbing to behold
such a blatant display of re-
ligious intolerance.

Whether or not one agrees
with the methods of .Peace
Pilgrim's ‘Inner Way," she
certainly deserved quiet at-
tention, or at least quiet, in-
stead of uproarious laugh-
ter.

I am afraid, though, that
the rejection of unorthodox
spiritual possibilities by
Davidson’ students is just a
part of the general atmos-
phere of moral indifference
and social intolerance here.
Most students remain prag-
matically unconcerned with
spiritual insights and moral
values, in spite of the human-
izing liberal arts education

they claim to be receiving.
f

Instead of making one
more tolerant of others’ be-
liefs by opening up new
worlds of experience, the
Davidson environment seems
ww encourage rejection and
ridicule of any way of life

Gardner Knocks Paper
For Being Too Serious

To The Editor:

I wandered into my room
after classes last Friday
morning and found the latest
edition of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN lying under the door. I
began to think about how
much I appreciated this ges-
ture since I'm sure it must
have inconvenienced you to
do that every week for the
past three years.

Then I tried to read it.

I suddenly became quite
sleepy, but couldn't figure
out why since your treat-
ment of the news is so high-
ly regarded (at least ac-
cording to the publicity
you so often give yourselves
for your own awards). I may
be sticking my neck out by
criticizing such obviously
well-respected newsprint, but
you gentlemen get so damned
serious about everything that
the overall tone of your paper
becomes horribly tedious.

I think you would do well
to save some of the space
formerly given to people like
Franklin Anderson, for ex-
ample, whose meaningless

chatter is not worth reading,
and use it to put in a little
more humor..I can’t imagine
why you did not give Rocky
Crosswhite a column last
week, since the few good
laughs you allow him to give
make your treatment of the
news much easier to digest.

I found out last week that
without good writers like
Crosswhite THE DAVID.
SONIAN is quite unbearable.
IT am aware that sobriety
must be the prevalent tone

eg le aad “wae!

of news media; but it should
not be the only tone.

In the past, Rocky has
proven his ability to add
comic relief to the ponder-
ously serious crusading
criticism which usually

the war in Asia, the racial,
strife in our cities and the
alienation of the young and
the poor. He was elected by
the slender margin of 50,000
votes out of' sixty million,
with only 43 percent in a
three.way rdce. Both houses
of Congress are still controll.
ed by Democrats. and even
though this next Congress
will be rather conservative.
Mr. Nixon will have a sticky
job with it. especially in the
Senate, which is often con-
siderably more liberal than
the House.

In addition, the committee
chairmen are often Southern
Democrats with strong Wall-
ace support smoldering in
their home states. But Mr.
Nixon has great skill both as
a politician and as an ad-
ministrator, and he hopes to
bind the nation’s wounds and
bring people together. This
is an enormous task, and
somebody obvously has to
do it.. But Nixon?

How is Dick Nixon going to
unite the Negro vote with J.
Strom Thurmond? How does
he plan to unite the youth
vote with Everett Dirksen?

How are such hawkish lions
as Ronald Reagan, Robert
Packwood and Richard Sch-
weiker to Ife down with the
lambs who supported Robert
Kennedy. George McGovern,
Eugene McCarthy and Nelson
Kockefeller? How does he
hope -to bring fiscal conser-
vatives to the support of his
extremely expensive scheme
to increase our already vast
nuclear arsenal?

This is the task which
Richard Nixon has taken
upon himself by conducting a
campaign devoid of specific
proposals to deal with the
problems of our modern age.
But after all, he is the next
President, and I can only
hope he does well. He has
a rough road ahead of him.

For A Weekend, | Loved You

For a weekend, I loved you.

You came down the stairs and I caught my breath.
You with the long hair, the subtle perfume.

Friday night. We went to see “The Heart Is a
Lonely Hunter,” and you cried at one man’s loneliness.
Can you cry for my loneliness?

Saturday, and we drank cham-
pagne for lunch. Celibate Davidson

was very far away.

Sunday noon, and I laughed at
your ordering a coke, scrambled
eggs and french fries. I cared about

you very much.

Then a brief kiss, and we both
retreated into our own worlds.

I don’t like good-bys.

Today, your kisses are ghosts of f
the weekend, haunting me. I have P|
only memories and a sweater that .

smells of your perfume. You have
only an empty champagne bottle.

Today you're there and I'm here. The

jles sep-

arate us. Both sequestered. You at a school for/women,

I at a school for men.

Was there a sense of urgency about our loving
because we, both of us, live in artificial five-day worlds?
Half-alive during the week, we find a reality and a
completeness only on weekends.

This week,

e men in your life are old enough to

be your father, and the women in my life are only the

librarians.

Why should I spend four years of my life in a
real world only during weekends, holidays and sum-

mers? Why should you?

We did this to ourselves by choice, but was it a
good choice? Did what we thought were diamonds turn
out to be rhinestones? Has the value of what we once
thought was valid in educational! institutions diminish-

ed?

You laughed and said that if you had lived in a
nunnery for four years, you wanted every girl who
follows you to have the same experience.

Is there any future for us? We are doomed, it
seems, caught up in the fun of being together for two

i

days and then caught up in our own

ves, in our apart-

ness for the rest of the week.
I might fall in love with you if circumstances were

different.

But for now, I see you only rarely. The time and
expense of road trips keep us apart. We are both
pressured by academic busy-work. This jinx rides us

apart,

Now, I can only remember: your hai i
over the pillow, your kisses. . . y hair cascading
_ By a curious set of circumstances, we. have de-
prived ourselves of reality, of love.
