DAVIDSON MEN ATTEND

Freeman Speaks On General Lee
And North Carolina

The North Carolina Literary and His-
torical Association last week elected Dr.
J. M. McConnell, dean of the faculty at
Davidson, as its president for the next
year.

The 34th annual session of the As-
sociation, meeting at Raleigh, Tuesday
and Wednesday, Dec. 4th and 5th, elected
Dr. McConnell to succeed Dr. Frank P.
Graham, president of the University of
North Carolina, who has served as the
Association’s president for the past year.

Dr. McConnell and Dr. E. F. Shew-
make, were members of the committee
which awarded the Mayflower Cup to Dr.
Erich Walter Zimmerman, University of
North Carolina professor. Dr, Zimmer-
man, whose book, World Resources and
Industry, was judged the best of more
than thirty-five reviewed by the judges,
was presented the award at Wednesday
night’s session by Governor Ehringhaus.

One of the interesting speakers of the
meeting was the North Carolina poct,
James Larkin Pearsons, mountain poet
from Bone, who delivered an address on
“The Soul of Poetry,” and also read some
of his own poems.

Dr. A. R. Newsome, Secretary to the
North Carolina Historical Commission,
was re-elected Secretary of the North
Carolina Literary and Historical Asso-
ciation. In addition to Dr. McConnell
and Dr. Newsome, the Association in its
morning session named Phillips Russell
of Chapel Hill, as first vice-president,
Mrs, John H. Anderson of Raleigh, as
second vice-president, and Mrs. Kate R.
McDiarmid of North Wilkesboro, third
vice-president.

Dr. McConnell presided over the Wed-
nesday evening meeting in the absence of
the president, who was called to Wash-
ington. The principal address of the
session was made then by Dr. Douglas
Southall Freeman, editor of the Rich-
mond News-Leader.

Dr. Freeman spoke on “General Rob-
ert E. Lee’s Association with North
Carolina’. He was introduced by Dr. T.
W. Lingle, Davidson professor. Dr.
Freeman covered briefly General Lee's
visits to North Carolina prior to and
subsequent to the Civil War.

The greater patt of his address was
devoted to a discussion of his relations
with the State during the war. Author
of a four-volume biography of Lee, Dr.
Freeman covered his subject in detail.

Lee’s first visit to North Carolina, Dr.
Freeman said, was on November 7, 1840,
when he came to the State as a captain
of engineers in the United States Army
to inspect Fort Macon and probably Fort
Caswell.

ulations concerning it.

Fire Chief Calls Attention
To Christmas Fire Hazards

During the Christmas season each year
many lives are lost and homes destroyed
by fire. Volunteer firemen in the TOWN
OF DAVIDSON find it important to
point out the special Christmas hazards
to the Citizens of Davidson at this time
of year.

Fires during this part of the year bring
hardships to firemen as well as to people
who may lose property and loved ones.
The freezing of hands and feet at winter
fires is a common occurrence.

Exposure of men who are driven into
the cold to answer alarms and to fight
needless fires is frequently followed by
pneumonia. Then, too, fires are more
difficult to fight} 1 winter and the freez-
ing of extinguishing appliances hinders
the work of firemen.

Christmas fires are largely caused by
carelessness in use of decorations and
lighting effects.

The presence of combustible Christmas
trees, decorations, trimmings, toys, and
other things ait are used to brighten
up and help the holidays, are,easy sub-
jects for ignitions by small sparks and
they spread fire rapidly.. In the last few
years the availability of decorations
which do not burn rapidly has somewhat
improved this situation.

The Davidson Fire Department is
ready to codperate at any public gather-
ings during the Christmas holidays, to
see that aisles and exits are kept clear
of obstructions and that other fire safety
precautions are taken.

Even a small fire in crowded store,
theater, church or school may result in a
panic and loss of life.

Evergreen trees are highly flamable,
especially when they have been allowed
to become dry. They should not be
placed’ near a fireplace or stove and
neither should they be placed in a posi-
tion where they will block an exit. Trees
should be firmly anchored so that they
cannot be easily tipped over by children
reaching for. things on them.

In all cases trees should be removed
a few days after Christmas day as they
become more of a hazard the longer they
are in a warm house. Many fires are
caused each year because trees are not
removed soon enough.

The use of cotton for “snow” has
caused many large loss fires. Asbestos
wool, properly treated cotton, metal tin-
sel and glass decorations and trimmings
are safe to use.

The use of candles on trees is very
dangerous. Although the use of electri-
cal tree-lighting units has reduced this
hazard they too must be used with care.
Electric bulbs should be screwed’ tightly
in their sockets and should not be placed
near pine branches, wreaths, or other

|decorations, because bulbs generate con-

siderable heat and may ignite them. The
insulation on the wiring Should be ex-
amined each year.

Pht BETA KAPPA
MEMBERS HEAR
REV. CHALMERS

Addresses Scholarship Group On
Subject “Need Of Brains
In Religion”

FOLLOWED BY BANQUET

Local Chapter Initiates Ten New
Men In Ceremony

Rev. Dwight M. Chalmers, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church in Char-
lottesville, Va., addressed the North Car-
olina Gamma Chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa, Monday night, December 10, at
eight o’clock in the Chambers Auditor-
ium, on the subject, “The Need of Brains
in Religion”, after the formal initiations
of ten new men into the Davidson Chap-
ter.

Three aspects may be considered in
regard to the title; theological, sociologi-
cal and psychological. These fields re-
quire brains for development.

The psychological field “deals with the
inner development of one’s own soul.”
After all, the primary business of the
church is not to keep men’s theological
Opinions up-to-date, nor even to instruct
them in social reforms, but their para-
mount aim is to bring men into contact
with spiritual realities. “We have been
unable to develop in man a profound
sense of God and a clear apprehension
of the mind of Christ and as yet we have
no technique for this achievement”,
stated Rev. Chalmers.

“During the past year,” the speaker
said, “conferences on social problems
were held at Montreat and Massanetta,
Virginia.” Several Synods have strong
committees on social and moral welfare
and the General Assembly last May set
up such a committee of its own.

Many factors have contributed to this
new interest in the social aspect of re-
demption which are: (1) The increase
and improvement in means of communi-
cation has,tended to break down local
prejudices and racial animosities which
has helped create a cosmopolitan spirit.
(2) A second factor was the growth of
the idea that progress in human society
is possible.

Third, a new sense of the worth of
each individual that is accompanying the
rise of democracy, and four, the past cen-
tury witnessing of the rise in industrial-
ism. This system brought fabulous
profits to industrial barons who con-
trolled the system while the lives of the
many were mechanized.

In their first game they defeated the Pi

the Beta’s.

In the semi-final rounds the S.P.E.’s
defeated the Kappa Sigs and the K.A.’s

soloists were: Warren Babcock, Cello;
and Frank Tucker, baritone. A novelty
was introduced in the way of a saxo-

tan” and “The Stars and the Stripes For-
ever.”

The glee club ‘sang the locally popular
“Shortin’ Bread”, some spirituals, and

Dr. MacConnell Makes
Statement About Flu

As the members of the Davidson
tudent body ghed, some faked,
some sadly trve, in chapel yester-
day morning, Dr. J. W. MacConnell,
college physician, stood before them
and reassured everyone with regard
to the flu “epidemic”’ which the stu-
dents seem to be so conéerned with
at the present time.

Due to an overcrowding and lack
of beds and equipment in the col-
lege infirmary, a temporary ward
composed of about twenty beds and
several extra nurses has been or-
ganized in the banquet hall of
Chambers Building. A canvas of
all the dormitory rooms was made
and all students needing dical at-
tention were removed to the ward.

Exaggerated rumors.to the effect
that school would lef-aut early for
the holidays on account of the flu
were disqualified and Dr. MacCon-
nell made the statement that while
the number of cases was above nor-
mal none of the cases had reached
the critical stage.
