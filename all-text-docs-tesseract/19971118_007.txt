“You don’t wash dishes,” they told
me. “You don’t take out the trash. You
don’t do anything. You're the queen

I squirmed. A swarming aura of
hatred had filled the room soaking the
velvet walls behind me. What had
begun so innocently had become an
undeserved and unwarranted interro-
gation. Just minutes before, I was

cookies, and massaging my belly (kind

asked them to pat it for
me.

But then I was sub-
jected to a most unnecessary criticism
of my disorderly habits.

“We've also noticed that you
squeeze the toothpaste from the middle,”
they continued, “This has got to stop.”

Suddenly I realized that I had be-
come the innocent victim of what I
choose to call P.O.T.F.K., or Pick on
the Fat Kid. They — “the skinny” —
were having a bad day, and I — “the
chunky” — just happened to be avail-
able .

“Toothpaste ought to be squeezed
from the center,” I argued.

In reply, the curly-haired philoso-
phy major began a dissertation on the
ethics of dental domesticity while the
two English majors shook their heads
behind him, waiting for a break in the
lecture, a gap to fill with some needless
psychoanalytic critique.of my lacklus-
ter behavior.

“The toothpaste shall be adminis-

“This is a blatant expression of
the Oedipal complex within” — the
literary antagonists had received the
pause they were waiting for. “By
squeezing from the middle, you dem-
onstrate an attempt to bypass the im-
mediate (separation from your mother)
while at the same time your actions
reflect a sincere denial of the future
(without your mother), a refusal to ac-
cept the inevitable — the end of the
tube of toothpaste.”

I noted that they had only argued
why I didn’t squeeze from the ends and
not why I squeezed from the middle.
And still I was not quite sure in the first
place why squeezing from the middle
was such a bad thing. Their banter
continued to evolve considerably — or

shall I say revolve endlessly — but by

now I had zoned out and was thinking or

other, more important things. My first

transgression unfortunately landed on
the topic of sororities at Davidson.

Fraternities are dumb. Sororities

have the other? Dumb & Dumber.

sented before me. I purposely returned
to my imagination. . .

.If I didn’t have so many
extracurriculars, would I be smarter?
Nope, I would probably just drink more.
How does one get smarter, anyhow?
Have all those bad grades I’ve gotten
this week made me smarter? In a way I
really think they have. I have started to
doubt. Not my education or my intelli-
gence, but I have begun to itemize the
things I definitely and absolutely can-
notdo. Wow, the list is already so long!

And yet there is this channel that
seems to be materializing beneath it all,
a rough but tangible groove forming
from what I have learned about myself

weekend? In her most recent
Davidsonian article, Liz Neiheisel des-
ignated the five types of males at this
school, and I'd like to think I was the
guy who “has the looks, the sensitivity
factor, and all the gentlemanly graces
required to sweep a girl off her feet.”

In reality, it’s the ladies who have
been wielding the broom around here,
and it is now apparent that I, along with
the rest of my apartment, have been
swept straight into the gutter.

I think I'll go to the mountains and
chase gorillas with Kevin instead.

Finally I returned to the couch for
good. The trial had concluded; the
prosecutors now sat around the kitchen
table, laughing about all
the fun times we’ve had

shallow.

they couldn’t figure that out on their
own. My tentative vote, which I cast in
place of all those members of CCRL
who did not attend that meeting, is yes.
Then I turned to puzzling thoughts
regarding my roommates. Why are they
so anal? Why must they be so disgust-
ingly persistent? .

The lecture, by this point, had lost
whatever direction it had originally
possessed. Now I was being told that I
needed to floss more often. I nodded
my head and agreed with them, but then
they disagreed with my agreement, de-
claring that I was not allowed to join
“their side.” Then I said that wasn’t fair
and they, of course, agreed.

there I decided that I
haven’t done enough of it
lately.

I decided to continue ‘my tooth-
paste squeezing habit regardless of the
degree to which it was detested. I
decided to write Op-Ed columns that .

We need to stop reading so much.
We need to have more reasons for you
to laugh at me. We need more people
pointing at us saying, “Man that was
dumb, but it sure was funny.”

We need more belly shakin’, more
god forsakin’, and more mind erasin’.
And I need more toothpaste.

Blur focus to find different types of ‘success’
