To Get Election Plans

203-64 Adoption Comes
After Intense Campaign

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Assistant Managing Editor

Students Wednesday adopt-
ed the first new constitution
since 1896 by a decisive 503-
64 vote, creating a Student
Guvernment Associa tion
(SGA).

The new constitution, which
establishés a Bill of Rights
and replaces the Student
Council with a 23-member
Senate, was approved by 89
per cent of those voting.
well over the two-thirds vote
needed for adoption.

Adoption came after an in.
tensive campaign by the Stu-
dent Council ahd the Consti-
tution Revision Committee.

Committees List Qualities
For Ideal Next President

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Managing Editor

The next president of Da-
vidson should be:

—A man “‘preferably not of
the present faculty or staff.”

—A man “who appreciates
the value and necessity of
money.”’,

—‘‘An active churchman
with a vigorous Christian
philosophy of life."

—A family man whose wife
has grace and charm.

Those are among a list of
16 personal and professional
qualifications suggested to
the trustee selection commit-
tee Monday by its six-man
faculty advisory committee.

In making its suggestions,
the faculty committee at the
same time emphasized it
realized no man could meet
all the qualifications.

“Obviously, there is no
ideal man.” the committee
said in a letter to the rest
of the faculty, ‘but hopefully
the man chosen will have
many of these qualities in a
large degree. and most of
them in a satisfactory de-
gree.”

Following its meeting with
the [aculty committee the
four man trustee selection
committee met with its stu-
dent advisory committee,

which also presented a list
of recommended qualifica-
tions.

The students’ recommenda-
tions for the most part echoed
those of the faculty. with a
few notable differences.

The students stressed that
the new president did not
‘necessarily nave to be a Da.
vidson graduate, whereas the
faculty did not mention his
undergraduate background at
all.

Noting the president's
broadening _ responsibilities,
the students also suggested
the creation of another ad.
ministrative position such as
provost or vice-president ‘‘to
share the work load of the
president's office.”

Neither student nor faculty
committee has begun discus-
sing individual candidates.

Faculty Criteria
Draw Criticism

The personal qualifications
for President D. Grier Mar-
tin's replacement suggested
by the Faculty Advisory
Committee have been criti-
cized by a Rump Committee
on Seriousness of Purpose.
Concision, and Precision at
Davidson College.

In a memorandum to the
faculty, the Rump Commit-
tee. claimed to consist of the
college’s janitorial and cus.
todial staff.

SONIAN to determine the
authorship of the report were

inconclusive. None of the cus-
todial personne! questioned,
however, admitted to having
had any part in preparing
the memorandum.

Decrying what it calls the
“levity and, indeed. the hilar
ity of the original report.”
the memorandum suggests a
different set of personal qua
lifications:

“1. A Presbyterian scholar
who is also a Christian.

"2. A Presbyterian scholar
who can get and = spend
money.

“3. A Presbyterian scholar
who is sexually potent and
married to Jacqueline Ken-
nedy.

‘4, A Presbyterian scholar
whose last name is Spencer."

Negotiation with Dr. Sam.
uel Spencer. president of
Mary Baldwin College and an
oft-mentioned candidate for
Davidson's presidency, is
said by the memorandum to
be the purpose of the “Trus.
tee Committee.”

Although the memorandum
does not specify which trus-
tee committee it is talking
about, it implies that it is the
trustee committee which is
to nominate to the full board
Martin's replacement.

One faculty member com-
mented today that he thought
the effect of the Rump report
might be to solidify support
for Spencer among people
who might view it as an un-
fair attack upon him.

Another faculty member
said, however, that he viewed
the report, not as an attack
upon Spencer, but as a satir-
ization of the criteria sug-
gested by the Faculty Ad.
visory Committee.

Chairman W. G. McGavock.

At Monday’s meetings, the
committees limited them-

selves to discussion of the-

president's qualifications and
the responsibilities of the
two committees, they said.

The functions of the faculty
committee will probably be
outlined further at the next
meeting, in early March, Me-
Gavock said.

In its list of qualifications.
the faculty committee also
recommended a man between
the ages of 40 and 55—unless
he had _  ‘“‘extraordinarily
strong compensating quali-
ties."

A man ‘wholly committed
to academic freedom’ and
who is friendly, creative and
self-confident — ‘‘but who
recognizes that Davidson Col.
lege is bigger than he is"—
was recommended by the
faculty.

Both committees have
urged suggestions concerning
the new president from either
the faculty or student body he
submitted, in writing.

“Students submitting
names should give as much
background information as
possible, or source of infor-
mation," the student com-
mittee said. ‘All names will
immediately be sent to the
trustee committee."

God is ‘“‘not a repressing
force, but a IMberating one,”
said Dr. John B. Cobb, this
year’s Otts Lecturer, yester-
day. Cobb, who teaches at
the School of Theology at
Claremont. California. spoke
on Wednesday and Thursday
evenings and at a voluntary
chapel on Thursday morning
on the topic “The God Who
Has Died and the God Who
Lives.”*

Despite his title. Cobb's
viewpoint admittedly has dit
tle in common with “death
of God" theologians except
for his agreement with their
criticism of traditional Chris-
tian language and symbols
connected with God.

This criticism, he feels, is
generated primarily by the

While the polls were open.
members of the Constitution
Committee went through the
dormitories to get students
to vote. and announcements
were made in the College
Union during meals.

The draft which was ap
proved was the product of 10
months of work by the Con-
stitution Revision Committee.

Appointed last April by the
council, the committee was
instructed to draft a com
pletely new constitution.

A preliminary draft was
presented in December and
the final draft in January.

Under the new form of gov-
ernment legislative power is
vested in the Senate. execu-
tive power in the Senate Exe-
cutive Committee and judi-
cial power in three Courts.

The Honor Court continues
in its present structure and

replaced by a 7-member Stu.
dent Government Court and
a Court of Appeals is created.

The Bill of Rights guaran

right to free inquiry and ex

to justify the ways of God to

wholesale genocide and im-

the force that draws the ten-
sion between what is and
what should be.

The results of this force,
he feels, are as real as those
of any of the ‘‘energy
events,"’ such as sub-atomic
particles as conceived in con-
temporary physics. and cer-
tainly more real than the
illusory solidity of so-called
solid matter.

Cobb cited Alfred -North
Whitehead as the principal
source of the raw material
for these ideas, but he fre-

quently referred to the con.
cepts of a diversity of mod:
ern theologians.

Student reaction to Cobb's
presentations was rather
neutral. The difficulty of the
material coupled with the
monotony of the speaker's
voice led a number of stu-
dents to doze during the lec-
tures.

Faculty reaction was gen.
erally more favorable and en-
thusiastic. Dr. Alexander J.
McKelway. assistant profes.
sor of Bible, while admitting
that he considered Dr. Cobb's
“connection of philosophical
understanding of this world
to understanding God" to be
“archaic,” stated that he was

originality of ideas’* that con.

By-Laws
Get Airing
On Monday

The by-laws for the new
constitution will be proposed
to the Student Council in two
steps, according to Mike
Bates, chairman of the Con-
Stitution Revision Commit-
tee.

By-laws dealing with elec-
tions and the oath of office
are to be presented to the
council Monday, and the oth-
er sections when the commit-
tee completes them.

Election by-laws are to be
presented earlier, Bates said,
because of the pressure of
impending elections.

According to Franklin An
derson, secretary of the com-
mittee and co-chairman of
the by-laws subcommittee.
election by-laws will probab-
ly include several innovations
in elections, pointed mainly
toward streamlining the proc-
ess,

An exhaustive ballot and a
new system of. breaking ties.
known as the HCS system.
will likely be recommended.
he explained.

The exhaustive ballot works
on the basis of ranking can-
didates instead of straight
voting, and eliminates the
necessity for extended run-
offs by combining the run-
off and the regular election.

Two deans and a trustee

sions with about 30 students
in a two-hour session Wed

mic schedule, student social
life, student participation in
faculty committees and sub-

Johnston said that putting
students on faculty commit.

don't think the students have
earned the right to run the
college."’ he said.

White. however, termed
the students “‘intelligent ob

2 Changes Made

Scheduling Committee, the
Office of the Dean of the
Faculty said today.

Following the Christmas
recess, classes will reopen
on Jan. 3 instead of Jan. 2,
the dean's office said. The
change will necessitate make-
up classes on Saturday. Jan.

dates to leave the fraternity
houses at night and forbid.
ing the. consumption of alco
holic beverages at the houses
had led to the death of some
fraternity members in traf

However. Burts said, “This
is a compromise situation.
It is necessary to have a cur-
few to satisfy the public re-
lations aspects of the situa
tion and also necessary to
have curfews late enough to
avoid placing undue restric
tions on anyone's’ enjoy
nient.”

Johnston also said that sub
sidized athletics will be con-
tinued at the planned levels
of moderate increase for at
least the next few years.

Dean Burts
Answers
Charges

Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts, target of severe
criticism from senior Joe
Bentley in last week's DA-
VIDSONIAN, said Wednesday
that he and Bentley had dif-
ferent understandings of the
school’s examination policy.

In a letter to Bentley this
week, Burts requested a con.
ference to work out misun-
derstandings between the
two.

Bentley, in a letter to the
editor last Friday, charged
Burts with a “hands-tied”
policy on re-examinations.

However. Burts said, ‘I'm
acting under the general
framework that has been set
up by the faculty executive
‘committee... He also said
that he was not intruding on
the executive committee's
territory, as has been charg
ed.
