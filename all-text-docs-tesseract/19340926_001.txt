Davidson’s Nine Social Fraterni-
ties End Brief Rushing
Season

116 NEW MEN PLEDGED

Half Freshman Class, Six Upper-
Classmen Accept Bids

One hundred and sixteen men signified
their intentions to join one of the nine
social fraternities on the Davidson Cam-
pus by appearing at the houses oftheir
choice at nine o'clock, Wednesday night,
September 19th. This concluded a rush-
ing period which began September 12th
with the opening of school and paused
at 10 o'clock, Tuesday, to begin the Day
of Silence, which ended at seven o'clock
Wednesday evening.

One hundred and ten of these men
were Freshmen, composing exactly half
of the class of 1938, while six were
transfers from other schools, Leading
in the quantity of pledges were Pi Kappa
Phi and Kappa Sigma, each pledging six-
teen men.

Rush week was cut to six days by the
faculty as an experiment. Due to the
shortness of the period, rushing was un-
usually hectic and competitive. In their
efforts to entertain the new men, fra-
ternities utilized dances, feeds, smokers
and banquets in the six day period.

A list of the pledges and the fraterni-
ties follows:

Grid-Graph In Shearer
To Be Used This Year

It has been definitely announced by
Heath Whittle that the Grid-graph in
Shearer Hall will be operated this year.
Since many stlidents are planning to go
to Greensboro for the Davidson-State
game next Saturday, it will be necessary
to find out how many men will be here
to see it on the Grid-graph board,

If there are enough to pay for the use
of the wires the board will be run, Other-
wise, it will not be operated. The
charges to see the State game will be fif-
teen cents for students. and twenty-five
for faculty members and outsiders.

Due to the fact that the Army game
is to be played so far from home, there
will be an increase in prices in-order to
cover the increased cost for the use of
the wires.

The Grid-graph will \also be run for
the Citadel ‘game October the twenty-
seventh,

HOLLING HEARS
DAVIDSON HEAD

Delivers Address On “Christian
College Objectives’’ At
Opening Exercises

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of
Davidson College, was the featured
speaker on the Hollins College opening
exercises last Friday evening. The ex-
ercises were opened with a musical pro-
cessional after which Dr, Randolph, pres-
ident of the College, took charge of the
program and introduced Dr. Lingle. Hol-
lins was founded in 1842 and became the
first chartered school in Virginia, and
one of the first in the nation for the
higher education of young women.

In making the opening address, Dr.
Lingle chose as his subject “Some of the
Objectives of a Christian College.” He
began by stating that “Christopher Col-
umbus started on his history-making voy-
age without knowing where he was go-
ing; he arrived in America without know-
ing what he was there for; and, when he
returned to did not know
where he had been.” Dr. Lingle then
showed how this example could be com-

Europe he

pared to a great many college students
who “have not defined in_ their
minds the aims and purposes which, they

own

have in view.”

Particular stress placed ‘on the
idea that students should reach out
various fields, such as Music, Art, and
Philosophy, and lay hold of some of the
best in-each of those departments. Other

wis
in

objectives pointed out by Dr. Lingle were
the importance of the college in teaching
men how to think and in developing their
personalities.

Saturday morning Dr. Lingle drove to

Lexington, Va., where he attended the
Washington and Lee-Wofford football
game. Sunday morning he conducted

services at the First Presbyterian Church
of Lexington.

Faculty Makes Ruling
For Church Attendance

Juniors and Seniors are no longer ac-
corded the privilege of attending the
Vesper service and counting it in plac
of regular church attendance. ‘This we
the substance of #n announcement made
a few days ago by the Dean's Office.

Heretofore members of both clas
could go to the Vesper service in place
of going to either morning or evening
church service, but they will no longer
be permitted to do this.

The Y. M. C. A., which sponsors. the
Vesper services, would like to have at-
tendance entirely voluntary rather than
somewhat compulsory as in past years.
A faculty committee has ruled that the
interpretation of the college rule should
not be made to include Vespers, but
should mean only services held in the
church itself.

Dr. Sentell also wishes to remind Jun-
iors and Seniors that they are not to use
seats assigned to underclassmen either in
chapel or church. If they do they will
receive absences,

Juniors and Seniors reporting attend-
ance on their home church aré asked to
fill out the regular blanks, substituting
the name of their church for the David-
son church. This is to be done in place
of signing the list in the Dean’s Office.

to an early start by chalking up 13 points

Captain Johuny Mackorell then showed
the fans that he could. still lug the
leather in a very superb fashion by break-

yard jaunt that again put the Wildcats in
scoring position, and in spite of a five yard
