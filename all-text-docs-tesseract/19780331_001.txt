Spring Convocation features Wellford

By KIRBY OWEN
Staff Writer

Last year there were two
gatherings during Spring A-
wards Convocation. While the
formal event was taking place in
Love Auditorium, approxi-
mately 300 students and faculty
members boycotted outside in
protest of the College Admini-
stration’s decision not to hire
Professor of Political Science
Ronald Linden, a Jew.

Assistant to the President
Gary Barnes, who is planning
this year’s Convocation, ex-
pects no diversions and believes
the day will run smoothly.

This year the Convocation
address will be delivered by
writer and politician William
Harrison Wellford, a member of
Davidson’s class of 1962.

Wellford earned an M.A.
from Cambridge as a Marshall
and Danforth Fellow. He holds
a Ph.D. from Harvard and a
Doctor of Jurisprudence degree
from Georgetown University.

In the early 1970’s, he was
appointed Executive Director of
the Center for the Study of
Responsive Law and he has
written numerous books and

Center
for senior

articles on pollution and the
environment. His works include
the book Sowing the Wind:
Food Safety and Chemical Har-
vest, published in 1972.

Wellford served as chief legis-
lative assistant to the late
Senator Philip A. Hart (D.
Michigan) from June, 1973,
until September, 1976. He
headed the government reor-
ganization team.

On February 21, 1977, Well-
ford was designated Executive
Associate Director for Reorgan-
ization and Management of the
Office of Management and Bud-
get. He was responsible for
Federal regulatory policy, ma-
nagement improvement and re-
organization.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. asked Wellford to

come to Davidson and direct his
comments on the Carter Admi-
nistration and on his activities.
‘‘He should be very inter-
esting,’’ said Barnes.

Awards will also be presented
to the students during Convo-
cation. The majority of these
awards will be presented to
members of the senior class.

The Thomas Jefferson A-

ward, the only faculty award, .

will be presented to the profes-
sor who the faculty believes
‘has given of himself generous-
ly and well beyond the normal
call of duty.”

Of the five men who will
receive honorary degrees at this
year’s convocation, all but one
graduated from Davidson. The
recepients of honorary degrees
are chosen through a joint

process of the Board of Trustees
and the faculty.

A committee is set up to
prepare a list of possible recipi-
ents. This list is then presented
to the faculty for their scruti-
ny. The list the faculty ap-
proves is then taken to the
Board of Trustees for their final
ratification.

ceremony, there will be alunch-

Barnes said that Wellford
and the earlier Davidson alumni
‘‘present a good contrast for
Davidson students to see what
these men have done after
graduating from Davidson.”

finishes code

In what faculty spokesmen are calling his first major act since
taking office, Vice-President for Academic Affairs T.C. Price
Zimmermann yesterday sent to the faculty’s Professional Affairs
Committee (PAC) the first detailed written statement on faculty
evaluation to have ever been drafted at Davidson.

The document, which Zimmermann said has been extensively
revised by both himself and College President Samuel R. Spencer,
Jr. since first being written in the late fall, was released to all five
PAC members shortly after noon yesterday.

“Basically the document codifies what we do now. By no means
should it be looked upon as a new sudden miracle machine to
eliminate all the problems,” said Zimmermann.

PAC members plan to study the administration proposals *and

then meet as often as necessary for detailed discussion, according to
Chairman Albert Allen Wolf, Professor of Physics. R
Should the committee object to any part of the document,
Zimmermann said it will have to be revised even further. The College
Constitution states that evaluation procedures must be drawn up in

conjunction with the faculty.

“Tf there are things in the document that the faculty do not find to
their liking, I will sit down with them and discuss it. Our goal is
agreement: it’s not like the coal miners’ strike,’’ he said.

“T hope that it (sending the statement to PAC) will be the first
step in a short procedure,” explained Zimmermann.

Zimmermann said that the timing of the document’s release is not
related to recent criticism of the evaluation procedures used in
deciding not to renew the contract of Professor of Political Science
and Director of South Asian Studies, Tonia K. Devon.

WDAV sets sights on power increase

By PHILIP D. DUNCAN
Editor

One month from tomorrow
WDAV-FM, for years a 10-watt
fledgling in the radio world, will
pull the switch and begin broad-
casting at 18,500 watts to a
potential audience of 2 million
people in greater Charlotte area.

That sum will offset the equip-
ment purchases and some stu-
dio improvements necessitated
by the switch to high power.
Lovell expects the $70,000
goal to be attained. ‘‘We have a
number of verbal commitments
and some strong possibilities
for donations that I don’t care

hand. ‘‘We have the transmitter
and antenna’”’ and some renova-
tion of the studio has been
completed. ‘‘We dre waiting for
capital funding to further up-
grade the studio equipment.
What we have there now we can
make do with until we have
more funds.”’

Lovell says he can persuade
potential donors that the sta-
tion is a sound investment.

He does not know what
WDAV’s yearly operating bud-
get will be. He does not expect
that the station will bring in
enough money to support itself
in the first years of operation,

and second, if people are willing
to invest in this.”

Currie emphasized that the
Trustees are interested in the
retirement community but that
the project will be financially

independent of the college.

Director of WDAV Don Lo-
vell spoke to The Davidsonian
this week about the progress
the station is making towards
the high power move.

Lovell said that the station is
“halfway there’’ to its initial
fund-raising goal of $70,000.

to be specific about at this
time."

While the donations are ac-
cumulating, money from the
College is financing the sta-
tion’s expenditures. ‘‘This
makes us stable,’’ said Lovell.
Since the College backs WDAV,

but confirms that WDAV will
encourage contributions from
outsiders and will try to work
away from its current position
of near total financial depen-
dence from the College.

The essentials for switching
to high power are already ‘on

‘We are behaving now just as if
we are at high power.”’ Al-
though Lovell maintains that

which the station is now opera-
