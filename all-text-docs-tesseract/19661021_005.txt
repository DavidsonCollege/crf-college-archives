While Homer's Henchmen hit
the comeback trail this past
weekend, George Washington's
harried Colonials handed East
Carolina a 20-7 dousing last Sat
urday to highlight conference
competition elsewhere.

The Pirates looked almost as
feeble as Vanderbilt, as GW
rolled up 265 yards total offense

and 18 first downs to slap Coach
Clarence Stasavich with “he
worst single winging of ifs ca

The. Pirates scored in the last

Davidson played poorly and was
just outhustled.

“We played a good game to-
day. Their first two goals were
lucky,"’ said Fogleman. He con-
tinued by pointing out that sev
eral boys were either absent or
injured Wenesday and weakened
the team considerably. Willie

played poorly around the goals.

Fogleman stated that Duke
passed well and that their su

get most of the head shots in
the middle. He concluded by say
ing, “‘Duke is the best team
we've played.”

Davidson's next game will be

Tennis Clinics Lure Coach

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor

Instructional clinics and
talks with international ten-
nis figures highlighted
Coach Harry Foglemans
trip to Europe this summer.

“The trip had a two-fold pur
pose,” said Fogleman, “‘in that
number one, Spalding sent me
over to represent them at the
Wimbledon championships. and,
number two, I was to partici-
pate in some Dutch Lawn Ten-
nis Association clinics and talks

in Holland.
Part of Fogleman’s duties as

Spalding’s representative were |
promotional. ‘‘I met the Spalding }

personnel playing at Wimbledon
such as Cliff Drysdale of South

Africa, Owen Davison of Aus- >

tralia and America’s Dennis

Ralston,”’ he said.

Along with a six-day stay ate

Wimbledon, Fogleman said he

had an opportunity to visit sev-

eral of the department and sport-
ing goods stores and to meet

many of the business people of”

England.
Fogleman's trip became even

more international when he was |
contacted by Polish and Soviet |
trainers and coaches, who had

been informed of his visit. At
the request of Soviet Coach An
dreev, he was asked to meet
with them concerning junior-
level and college methods of
coaching.

Attending the conference were
the vice president of the Polish
Lawn Tennis Federation, a
coach and trainer of the Soviet

team and a Soviet team official. |

Coach Fogleman also brought
out that he had been issued an

invitation to visit Poland and}
the Soviet Union, “but after due}

consideration I turned it down.

1 did find, however, that the

Soviets are keenly interested in
tennis and have developed sev
eral good players. They are go-
ing to be a factor in the Davis
Cup in the not. too distant fu
ture.”

"HARRY FOGLEMAN

Fogleman went on to France
and then to Holland, where he
was the guest of the Koninklijke
Nederlandsche Lawn_ Tennis
Bond. Most of the top Dutch
tennis instructors were there
along with about 150 children,
who had been let out of school
early for the occasion. Fogle
man participated in a demon
stration of mass instruction and
a discussion of the American
tennis program regarding junior
tennis, the junior Davis Cup and
intercollegiate tennis.

Besides the tennis program,

soccer is the big sport in Eu-}

rope along with golf in the well

to-do circles. ‘‘I was impressed,”*}

said Fogleman, “with. some of

the most beautiful soccer fields |

I have ever seen. In Rotterdam
they were almost too-pretty to
play on.”

Fogleman did accomplish one}}

foreseeable objective through his

| trip in that he increased the in-

terest in the Richardson Scholar
ship program among budding

Dutch tennis prospects. “They |

were extremely interested in
the project,”’ he said, “‘and they
are in the process of interview-
ing candidates. We hope short.

ly to get the application of a. fine}

Dutch student who is also a fine
tennis player.”

Open ‘til 12:30 a.m.

Monday—Friday

The success of Fogleman’s |
venture is evidenced by his in-|
vitation to return to Wimbledon |
next summer for Spalding and
to visit their operations in Eu-}
rope. He has also been invited
back to Holland.
