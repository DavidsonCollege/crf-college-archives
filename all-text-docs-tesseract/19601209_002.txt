The Faculty Still Means Business

We hope that the elation which
spread over Patterson Fraternity
Court last Tuesday at suppertime has
been tempered by some sober think-
ing.

The effective date of Sophomore
Rush was postponed for a minimum
period of one year — with the post-
ponement to be continued indefinite-
ly unless the faculty should deter-
ine that the revised program has fail-
ed to achieve the desired objectives.

The faculty tied a few strings to
its retraction.

We assume that the strings be-
come effective immediately—but few
fraternity members seem to have
grasped this point. Pledges still car-
ried paddles this week. and they still
ran stud.

There has been no formal an-
nouncement from President Martin
that hazing. no longer couched in ab-
stract terminology, is taboo. But.this
is no excuse for us to delay putting
into effect the fraternity president’s
revised program and adhering to the
new Red Book regulations.

Dr. Goodykoontz said of the frater-
nity presidents, “I think these leaders
deserve the encouragement and sup-
port of the faculty.”

We agree. And now that they
have the encouragement and support
of the faculty, they need the same
thing from the IFC and the individ-
ual fraternity members.

Without this support, it may have
to be proved to us once again that the
faculty means busiriess.

Courage And Compromise

Davidson fraternity men owe a
deep measure of appreciation to a
man and a group. The man is Dr. Wil-
liam F. Goodykoontz and the group is
the combined fraternity presidents.

The presidents did what the IFC
and the ‘raternities proper could
never do: They presented the faculty
and student body with a mature, real-

istic slate of reforms: they realized
that the faculty would not be pacified
with proposals shot full of loopholes;
they had the courage to make an un-
conditional proposal. with no assur-
ance that Sophomore Rush would, be

retracted as a result of it.

Dr. Goodykoontz scrapped part of
his idealism for practical purposes in
a move. that can only be regarded as
a compromise on his part.

For a man so staunch in his con-
vietions, this took an even greater
measure of courage, Perhaps at last.

a large portion of the student: body
will realize that Dr. Goodykoontz was
never an idealistic ogre intent’ upon
tearing down the fraternity system,
but a teacher who is most concerned
with giving students an education not
dilute* by petty harrassment.

A Bold And Practical Action

The Student Council’s surprise de-
cision to slice the “under the influ-
ence” clause from the drinking rule
was a bold and practical move.

We approve of the deletion be-
cause we approve of an alcohol-free
campus consistent with the realities
of the present drinking situation.

The council has already been criti-

cised by some skeptics for undermin-

ing the tradition of student enforce-

ment of an alcohol-free environment.
But there is no tradition.

In the past three years only one
student has been turned in by a fel-
low student as “guilty of being under

the influence of alcoholic liquors while
on the campus.” And there was no
conviction in this particular case.

No Gestapo Here

THE DAVIDSONIAN received num-
erous complaints this: week regard-
ing the 2:00 a.m. room inspection
made by the Honor Court and Student
Council Tuesday. The inspection was
an attempt to discover if a student
had taken $10.00 in treated money
that had been planted by the Honor
Court.

Students were asked to get out of
bed and run water on their hands
to see if they had handled the treated
money. The thief was not discovered.

Students have commented that the
Honor Court used Gestapo methods
by forcing its way into the rooms,
that the inspection was an inconveni-

ence to students and a sneaky way to
operate.

We feel that the complaints have
come from people who are more con-
cerned about their own self-interest
than the effective operation of the
honor system. The main issue is that

Student Council President Henry
Shue, in his articulate letter to the
faculty, frankly laid his cards on the
table. “We feel that only the faculty
can enforce a rule against returning
to the campus under the influence,”
Shue wrote bluntly.

We regret that the influence clause
cannot be enforced by the student
government—but the fact remains, it
cannot, and will not be enforced. The
Student Council has been honest and
realistic enough to admit this.

We agree also with Shue's judge-
ment that to continue the present
policy of duplicity will undermine the
Honor System, an institution which

we feel is vital to this college com-
munity.

there may be a thief in the student
body who should not remain at Dav-
idson.

At no time during the inspection
was a student physically jerked from
his bed and dragged to his lavatory.
This method would have been used
by the Gestapo.

We do not feel that it was too much

of an inconvenience for a student to
cooperate with the Honor Court when

the enforceability of the honor sys-
tem is at stake. Members of the Honor
Court and Student Council were in-
convenienced more than anyone else.
We have received no complaints from
them.

Finally, the Honor Court has been
accused of being sneaky. Ridiculous.
The court could never catch a thief
if it had to announce ahead of time
when it was going to investigate and
what it was looking for.

Present Trend Indicates
An Application Increase

Davidson will receive well
over 1,000 applications from an.
expanding geographical area
this year, if the present trend
of applications continues. Be-
tween 400 and 500 of these will
Se accepted.

Figures available through
Nov. 30 show that 360 applica-
tions with $10 fees have been
received, 94 ahead of the same
period last year. This is an ap-
proximate 36 per cent increase.

“Of course, this doesn’t nec-
essarily mean we will have an
increase in the final total,”
commented H. Edmunds White,
associate director of admis-
sions,

INCREASE

“ However, though many fac-
tors could be involved. it is
most likely that a substantial
inerease will occur. And figures
bear out that much of this in-
crease comes from applicants
outside the South.

Davidson is coming to the at-
tention of more and more boys
in the North and Midwest. and
the number of this group being
accepted is likewise rising.

The geographical distribution
of the present freshman class,
as compared to past years, re-
flects this significant shift.
North Carolina students account
for only 36 per cent of the
class, as contrasted to 50 per
cent of the student body in
1957-58.

LETTERS TO

THE EDITOR

-”

McCarty: Let’s Alter

Dear Editor:
-“For the establishment of
friendship on a firmer and
more lasting basis , . . for the
mutual benefit and advance-
ment of the interests of those
with whom we sympathize and
deem worthy of our regard, we
have resolved to form a fratern-
ity, believing that thus we can
most successfully accomplish
our object.” Every fraternity
on this campus was probably
formed for similar reasons.

But do we not find that,
notwithstanding the superior
moral tone of Davidson's
fraternities in comparison to
fraternities elsewhere, that
the general temper of em-
phasis in our fraternities is
the same subtle hedonistic
tone of the American Way of
Life in general?

We have in many cases, let

Our Fraternity Ideas

brotherhood degenerate into a
series of associations whereby
one may practice the social
mechanisms to fit one to be a
well-seasoned social climber and
drinker to take his junior-éx-
ecutive-suburban- pretty wife-
self seeking place in our Amer-
ican Way of Life, which the
Bible calls the world. There is
no reason why we cannot stop
this tendency in our fraternities
and make them fraternities in-
deed.

A few years ago this paper
carried a cartoon of freshmen
being hammered into the mold
of the Davidson Gentlemen by
upperclassmen. Let's face it;
sophomore rush would do much
to make the freshmen more
Christian and less ‘candidates
for contemporary society.

But if we will take this time
to re-evaluate ourselves and
emphasize the true nature of
fraternal brotherhood, we may
find that we will do two things
—come closer to the way of life
that fosters, not retards, Chris-
tian birth and growth and make
our fraternities actually frat-
ernities which would be the
wonderful home and heln of the
incoming students.

David McCarty
