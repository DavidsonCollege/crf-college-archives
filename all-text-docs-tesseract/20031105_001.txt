Davidson students are almost
evenly split in their support for U.S.
efforts in the Iraq war, according to
a survey conducted by Dr. Pat Sell-
ers’ Public Opinion class.

The survey, which was e-mailed
on Oct. 16 to a random sample
comprising half the student body,
revealed that overall, approxi-
mately 49 percent of students either
strongly or somewhat disapprove
of U.S. efforts, while almost 51
percent of students somewhat or
strongly approve.

An additional e-mail, sent by Vic
Lindsay ’04 to the Young Demo-
| crats mailing list, encouraged all
club members to participate in the
survey and threatened to skew the
results. After carefully analyzing
the data, Sellers and his class deter-
mined that Lindsay’s e-mail had no

Students divided on
support for Iraq war

Recent poll finds 51% approve of intervention

Since the survey was a class
project, Sellers’ students created
the questions, designed the survey
format, and analyzed the results.
Besides the war in Iraq, they mea-
sured attitudes toward the file-shar-
ing of music and diversity on cam-
pus, among other things.

The class was also interested in
discovering if students would alter
their initial opinion of U.S. efforts
in response to theoretical develop-.
ments in Iraq. Those theoretical
developments included the discov-
ery of Saddam Hussein and weap-
ons of mass destruction and an in-
crease in U.S. casualties.

To measure changes in attitude,
the class presented each respon-
dent with a second set of questions
based upon their original approval
or disapproval of U.S. efforts in
Iraq.

Sellers explained, “If a respon

Students find cheaper
textbooks overseas

Buyers wait for latest national trend to hit home

By AMANDA STEPHENS
Staff Writer

Significant price disparities be-
tween domestic and international
textbook prices have encouraged
many college students to purchase
texts from overseas markets.

To avoid the traditionally long
lines and exorbitant prices of col-
lege bookstores, many students
are using the Internet to access

A recent study done by the NY
Times showed remarkable differ-
ences in pricing. For example, the
Lehninger Principles of Biochemis-
try, Third Edition costs $146.15 on
the American based Amazon.com.
However, the very same textbook
costs $63.48 on Amazon.co.uk. Even

with the cost of shipping and han-

dling, which the NY Times calcu-
lated to be $8.05, the book is still

$ far cheaper when purchased

In the UK, France, Is-

Through Internet sites such as
Amazon.co.uk, BooksCentral.com,
and varsitybooks.com, American stu-
dents are able to find the same text-
books sold in their country for much

outrageous price disparities. In an
effort to combat the high bookstore
prices at Williams College, two Jun-
iors started their own website,
BooksCentral.com. Other students
have begun purchasing overseas texts
in large quantities and selling them to
their fellow students.

Study: Duke women feel

pressure to be perfect
Do Davidson students feel the same way?

By ALLISON WHITEMAN
Staff Writer

More and more undergraduate
women are expressing dissatisfaction
with gender problems they face.

A study released by Duke Univer-
sity last month revealed that in addi-
tion to academic rigors, Duke women
feel enormous social pressure fueled
by gender inequality. Davidson stu-
dents questioned about the study’s
applicability to Davidson expressed a
myriad of opinions on the subject.

The Duke project, called the
Women’s Initiative, looks at gender
issues facing undergrads, graduate

students, and faculty alike. Under-
graduate women at Duke were ques-
tioned in 20 focus groups. In these
sessions, the women discussed gen-
der issues facing them todsy at the
college.

The 20 focus groups illuminated
three main social constraints for Duke
women: they felt pressured to wear
the latest fashions, to diet and exer-
cise constantly, and to hide their intel-
ligence when it\came to interacting
with men.

Women felt that this was necessary
for their success, and that their suc-
cess had to appear easy; they had to

Best-selling author
describes her need for
justice in ‘Ripper’ case
By Curistie KiLBy
Staff Writer

Davidson alumna and arguably the
most celebrated crime novelist in the
world Patricia Cornwell ’79 visited
campus Monday and Tuesday.

Promoting her recent book, “Por-
trait of a Killer,’ Cornwell delivered
a public lecture, visited classes, and
displayed her personal collection of
paintings by Walter Sickert — alleged
killer behind one of the most horrific
and unsolved crime mysteries in his-
tory.

The “Jack the Ripper” murders
took place in London’s Whitechapel
district in 1888. Six prostitutes were
victims of gruesome attacks that left
London’s East End in a panic, espe-
cially when the killer escaped cap-
ture. .

Cornwell investigated letters by
Jack the Ripper, crime records, law
enforcement expertise, and forensic
DNA testing — a blend of historical
and modern-day evidence — to pin
Jack the Ripper’s identity on Walter
Sickert. A famous painter of his day,
Sickert created works that, according
to Cornwell, are “imaginative and
psychological fingerprints of a psy-
chopathic killer.”

Though she is careful to make ob-
jective claims about subjective art,
Cornwell said, “I’m an artist myself.
Everything you create is a manifesta-
tion of something inside of you [...].
You can call it intuition, but looking
at his art was disturbing.”

The exhibit of 42 paintings, draw-
ings, and etchings,will not likely be
displayed anywhere else until
Cornwell has found the “right home”
for her collection. She anticipates in-
creasing interest in the case and hopes
that the art works will eventually be
accessible to the public.

For Cornwell, this project wasn’t
simply curious material for another
Kay Scarpetta novel. John Grieve of
Scotland Yard introduced Cornwell
to the Jack the Ripper case and the
investigation soon “took a dramatic
turn, became very serious” for her.
Describing her research as “scary,
exhausting, and nerve-racking,”
Cornwell said, “I hope I never have to
do anything like this again.”
