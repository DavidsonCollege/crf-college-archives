Recommendations For Revision

Rename the executive post within the
present Honors College the “Director for the
Center for Honors Studies.’ He will encourage
development of honors level work throughout the
college and continue to teach half-time.

2) Rename the present Honors College
building the “Center for Honors Studies.” The
building will house the office of the Director and
serve as the basic facility for activities involving
honors students.

3) Establish a “Council of Honors Studies.”
composed of the Director. departmental chair-
men and the vice president for academic affairs.
to encourage honors level work in all depart-
ments. Each department will be responsible for
planning and conducting its own departmental
honors studies: the Council will be responsible
for approving interdisciplinary honors majors.

4) Individual departments will be responsible
for providing teaching personnel for honors level
work. The supervision of five or more honors
Students will be considered the equivalent of
teaching one course.

5) Honors work will be primarily for juniors
and seniors. They will be expected to meet nor-
mal graduation requirements and will be graded
under the same system used for other academic
work in the college.

6) Rising seniors now in the Honors College
will proceed largely in accordance with present
arrangements: others will be expected to choose
a major and may seek admission to honors
studies under the program hereby recom-
mended.

College on the larger college
