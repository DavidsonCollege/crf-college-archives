Question of.

The Week

A pertinent Question te the mind
oi young cotlegites has proved ot
late to be; “Shall, we abolish Hell
Week?” ‘This period has often been
considered a gine of hardship‘on the
fraternity pledges. Let's hear what
a cross section-of the fraveritity men
think .

Russell Edmondson, Senior:

Doingaway with Hell Weelkchas
its advantages, It is a little hard on
the Freshmen and might render
them some temporary physical dis-
abilities. Iv also takes up some valu-
able time which could be spent”
the-books“—but havifg gone thru’

“Hell Week.” T think of it as some-
thing that Pr glad To didn’t miss.
I's something to-look—back on as a

should) remain on the Davidson
Campus. Initiation imS a fraternity
should have some of the °
type Ol discipline.

Jim Owens, Junior:

—The abolishment of hell-week in

a fraternity takes definitely a great

deal out of, the life of such a group
both from the standpoint of the fra-
ternity and of the pledge class. A
well.planned and well-conducted
hell-week with constructive aims in
view means much to a pledge class.
The freshmen expect such an- in-
itiation and I'm not in favor of dia-
appointing them. —
Ashby Dick, Sophomore:

[ think that “Tren Weer siren
Nery definitely remain a a part of the]
_iraternity initiation on our campus.
Aside from the fact that a great deal
of wholesome enjoyment is derived
from this practice of informal initia-
tion, by both initiates and initiators,
the true value and apprecation.for
the fraternity is more deeply in-
stilled into the pledge.

Tommy Bumbarger, Freshman:

In my opiniofi, students conie to
to get
what they get in class. The fratern-

college something besides

ity helps to give us this extra some-
thing and hell week is a vital part
of fraternity life. Although 1 do
think outright hazing should be, ob-
jectionable, [| see no reason’ why
hell week, should be abolished.

Bob Finley, Senior:

Being now wpon the sublime
heights of senior hill. 1 survey the
subject of the “Weck of Torment

Mr. Hengeveld announces that
post-examinations will be given

This plan was-—approved last
week by the faculty. A schedule
will be made out before the holi-
days, and no exams will be given
before March twenty.seventh.

justly judge it are fraternity men

sider cannot justly condemn it be-
cause he cannot possibly know the
unity which it brings about in a
class of pledges. | do not say that
this unity cannot be derived by some
other means but I do say that if

there is no definite and basic critic-

ism, then it seems a shame to take

away that means of keeping a fra-

ternity united in exchange for no- |

pledges of any one fraternity to

gain the close bond of brotherhogd
