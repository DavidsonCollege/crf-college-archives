Killing: next organized sport for colleges

(CPS) There will be people on
campus this fall—ordinary-
looking souls—who fear they're
being hunted by assassins,
challenged by dragons, and
befuiled by magicians. Daily
living for them will be an
exercise in dodging the enemy
and pursing illusions of glory.

But the ostensible outbreak
of paranoid schizophrenia is
really just part of a fantasy
game fad that has risen to peak
popularity in the last half
decade. The best-known variety
revolves around Dungeons and
Dragons and its derivatives.
‘Theother goes by names like
“Assassin” and ‘‘Killing As An
Organized Sport.’

‘‘Assassin’’ and its name-
sakes boomed into prominence
last winter, when bizarre re-
ports of students hunting one
another spread from midwest-
ern campuses to the University
of Florida, UCLA, and points in
between.

They’re being played every-
where. Dungeons and Dragons,
which borrows heavily from the
works of J.R.R. Tolkein, is
actually formally organized on
‘‘at least 200 campuses’’ by
various kinds of ‘“Tolkein fel-
lowships,”’ boasts Marta Cros-
by of the Tolkein League.

Most frequently called ‘‘Kil-
ling as an organized Sport,”’ it
has its roots in the sixties. It
takes its acronym, KAOS, from
the ‘‘Get Smart’’ spy spoof
television series, though the
game’s theme was plagiarized
from other media.

It is roughly based on The
Seventh Victim, a 1953 science
fiction novel by Robert Sheck-
ley that evolved into a 1965 film
called ‘‘The Tenth Victim.”’

As the story would have it, a
futuristic society eliminates war
by allowing its most aggriessive
citizens to commit legalized
murder. The killer’s goal is to
down ten victims before some-
one else kills him (or her(. If the
killer succeeds, he or she be-
comes a hero, is given luxuries
and wealth, and never has to
work again.

The story was translated into
a game played with toy wea-
pons. It enjoyed a brief vogue
at Oberlin College in the late
sixties before it was replaced by
other fads, and was largely

In 1976, some University of
Michigan students revived the
game, using plastic dart guns
for weapons. From: there, it
slowly began to spread to other
campuses, until it became a
definably national phenomenon
last spring. .

Game rules vary from cam-
pus to campus. Generally, play-
ers are given a hit list and are
required to “‘kill’’ a minimum
number of people on the list
weekly to stay in the game. As
they hunt, they are being
hunted by others, but the
players don’t know who is out
to get them. They can be “‘killed

Harold Clark, who takes his
name from the chief on “Get
Smart,’’ organized a giant
KAOS game aas a ‘‘summer
project” at the University ‘of
Texas last June. He hoped an
ad in the local paper would

lected about $166 for his skill as
tracking and assassinating the
other 64 contestants over al-
most three months of sneaky
business.

Dungeons and Dragons is
the better known and: more
complex role-playing game,
but can be just as consuming as
KAOS. There are tales of
students flunking out of school
because of D&D.

“It’s fun,” explains Will Nie-
bling, a vice president with
Tactical Studies Rules, a game
production company in Geneva,
Wisconsin.

And profitable. Niebling says
sales of the D&D equipment his
firm produces and markets have
doubled annually each year
since 1974, and have quadrup-
led in the last 12 months.

“You see the field growing
faster and faster," understated
Jamey Adams, an editor at
Games Magazine. “There are
any number of imitators coming
out with other role-playing
games involving gangsters,
King Arthur, science fiction.”’

Jim Dunnigan, who describes
himself as a lapsed historian,
invented one of them. He
created a game modeled on the
television series ‘‘Dallas.”” Dun-
nigan says that in the game, to
debut in stores in SOctober,
“each player takes a character
from the show, except one
person who is the director.”

It is obviously akin to D&D,
invented by M.I.T. grad GAry
Gygax and friend Dve Arneson
in Wisconsin ten years ago.

D&D, of course, involves an
array of unearthly characters,
derived from Tolkein books
about the Middle Earth. Each
player assumes the identity of
one of the characters, and takes
direction from the Dungeon
Master, a combination of a
referee and spontaneous play-
