Out of the
Greek Forum...

Out of the hallowed halls of the
“t- into the forum place has come an

o:d vet unsettled problem. The subject is
Greck Week: its goal: reorganization and
redefinition; its time: immediately.

The first assumption that must be
‘made tn consideration of Greek Week is
that any decision proposed thereon
heoretically affects 90 per cent of the
tudent bodv or some 750 men. There-
‘ere... aossible solutions and propositions
nould be carefully weighed in the balance
of the total number affected.

Friday, Feb. 3, 1956

The main criticism from the col-
lege has been caused by disruption
of the academic schedule by Greek
Week activities. In the past anemic
initiates have been prone to slumber
during class. using textbooks solely
for head support. This is certainly a
just and realistic criticism of a pro--
gram that has often resulted in a
period of academic stagnancy for
most and poor marks for many who
could not afford them. On the other
side, fraternities want to retain the
constructive and traditional practices
which have highlighted their own fra-
ternal experiences and traditions and
for which pledges have expressed a
strong desire to participate in this
year. Thus the problem is one of
reorganization of Greek Week ac-
tivities in accord with the academic
schedule.

Reorganization

In the light of this goal, it is only
logical and diplomatically just to expect
the parties concerned to strive toward
equitable support of a mean solution. As
in the past. lessons can be prepared in
advance if projected schedules are given
by the professors. Further, daily require-
ments such as writs and reviews should
be lessened for that. particular week with
attention focused on class lecture and dis-
cussion. It is noted that Eastern institu-
tions of the green vine variety, which we
often emulate, have great respect and
consideration for collegiate customs which
have become a part of the life of their
respective colleges. On the other side, it
will be necessary for some fraternities to
reorganize their activities to coincide with
the limits prescribed by the IFC in order
to allow sufficient sleep and study time
for initiates..

Failure to work toward a solution or
to abide by decision of the whole by any
element invoived can only reflect a defi-
nite Jack of understanding and imma-
turity of insight, which failure might well
result in serious reactions. The problem
must be seen in the light of individual
responsibility; and its solution rests with
‘the individual integrity of each fraternity
to uphold the endeavors of the whole to
accommodate the parts. Violation of the
agreed program can only result in penalty
to the violator and reflection upon the
whole.

Redefinition

Another important aspect to this
problem is one of redefinition. The activi-
ties of this particular week have been
dubio icly dubbed Hell Week. Purgatory
Pass, Valley of the Shadow, etc. The old
dattie between Hell Week and Greek
Week has been waged on many fields in
the past, and regardless of change the
week always emerged as Hell Week.

Fraternities here as a general rule
do not have what most experts on
the situation consider Hell Week.
There is no hazing, unbearable em-
barrassment of pledges, or daring en-
deavors to wreck the constitution or
the psychological self. None but the
neurotic and morbid desire Hell
Week in its pictured reality.

Instead most fraternities plan a con-

structive program centered around the
fraternity house, community, and the

brotherhood itself. Greek Week activities
can be generally grouped into three cate-
gories: 1) those that benefit the fraternity
and the community such as alumni writ-
ing, house cleaning, redecorating, and
community projects; 2) those that respect
individual traditions and produce mem-
ories such as elements of wearing apparel,
boarding house exercises, and group sing-
ing; and 3) those that point toward formal
initiation through instillation in the whole
fraternity of the purpose, functions, and
meaning of its brotherhood. Alumni, ac-
tives, and initiates testify to the worthi-
ness of this program.

The problem now posed must,
therefore, be considered in the light
of reorganization and redefinition.
Thoughtful evaluation by all elements
concerned is necessary for the per-
petuation and enrichment of this pro-
gram. Greek Week can be effective
and memorable—the decision rests
with faculty and students.

I Dare You

The following are tributes to William
H. Danforth. who gave so. generously of
his time and talents for the betterment of
mankind, and who in particular had con-
‘tributed so much to Davidson through the
Danforth Fellowships, Faculty-Student Re-
lations fund. and the ‘Vesper fund.

“When one must die, what a wonder-
ful way to go! William H. Danforth passed
away peacefully, full of age and honors
and good works, waiting for the Christmas
Carolers whose group he founded.

“Mr. Danforth founded and guided
fine groups for many years, but in addi-
tion to this, he was an eminently success-
ful businessman who established one of
the country’s finest corporations, the
Ralston Purina Company, and brought it
from a humble beginning of a handful of
workers to a great corporation with 47
plants across the land.

“Business success still left him time
for many important directorships and even
beyond this, time for vast contributions
to the civic, philanthropic and religious
life of this and other communities. His
many benefactions include 13 chapels in
many parts of the country and special
funds for religious education and com-
munity service.”

St. Lovis Globe Democrat

“It have known Mr. Danforth for a
good many years and consider him typical
of the tinest type of American citizen who
has made our way of life strong and ef-
fective.” Dr. J. R. Cunningham.

The Davidsonian sincerely seconds
these fine tributes to the memory of Wm.
Danforth, Christian gentleman, humani-
tarian, businessman, author and perpe-
trator of “I Dare You.”

One of the long standing, venerable in-
stitutions here on campus, the Forensic
Council, has made a positive attempt at
re-activation. It will strive to continue the
purposes, principles, and activities that
so distinguished them of old and produced
renowned orators, thought parriers, and
well-traveled intellects.

A search into old newspapers revealed
the fact that the debating team was at one
time.as actively followed and supported as
the athletic teams which were doing quite
well themselves.

Around six potential fire-eaters form
the nucleus of the modern Council. Trips
to Agnes Scott and New Orleans (Tulane
University Tournament) are in the offing,
along with possibilities of contests within
the state. To any interested gentlemen and
potential debators a strong encouragement
to participate in these honored activities;
and to the Forensic Council best wishes
and hearty support for an active and grow-
ing year.

THE IMPENDING CRISIS

Should Davidson Raise Her Enrollment to 1000?

By TOM WARLICK

Statistics revealed during the re
cent White House conference on
education and numerous other
studies concerning the rising tide
of enrollment which is to be ex-
pected in American colleges and
universities in the next few years
have unveiled an impending crisis
of tremendous scale. The ever in-
creasing flood of applications for
admittance into Davidson has
brought this problem home to such
an extent that no xiember of the
Davidson family can afford not to
be fully informed on this vital sub-
ject.

The report of the Fund for the
Advancement of Education has in-

seven hundred applied for admis-
sion to the freshman class, meaning
that one was turned down for every
one accepted. This year applica-
tions are running far ahead of last
year's figure,

This brings up the very serious
problem of whether or not the en-
roliment at Davidson should be in-
creased. Committees of the faculty
and Board of Trustees have been
meeting together for many months
and their recommendation on this
matter is expected to receive action
within the very near future.

There are two fairly well defined
positions on this matter. One group
feels that the enrollment should be
increased to 1000 students. A sec-

i

-. « There have been all sorts of predictions of what college enrollments
will be in the future. On the assumption that no major change in the
national economy, such as would be produced by a wer or a depression,
will intervene, most predictors agree that the first really strong pressure
of new students will be felt in 1960 when the jump from the previous
yeor will be 78,000 to bring the total number of college entrants to 787,-
000. If the estimates are correct, this means that the number of students
entering college in 1960 will be over one third greater than the number
that entered this fall. There will be an additional, but smaller, jump in
1961. Then in 1962 and 1963 there will be two slight declines that will
bring us back to the 1960 figure. The majer headaches will be felt in
1964 end 1965 by which time the number of college entrants is expected
to reach 1,037,000, nearly 80 per cent greater then the number this

fall...

—Dr. Henry S. Dyer in
COLUMBIA ENGINEERING QUARTERLY

ad

dicated that “college enrollments
are likely to reach double the 1954
level (of 2,478,000 students) some-
time between 1966 and 1971.” The
United States Office of Education
estimates the total of college stu-
dents at 5,035,000 by 1973, while
another projection, based on the
trend of the last few years, places
the figure at 7,231,000.

Another report concludes that
applications for admission into col-
leges will be one-third greater by
1960 than the present level and
will be 80 percent greater by 1965
or 1,037,000.

THE LOCAL PROBLEM

The problem ‘here at Davidson is
equally serious. Last year almost

ond group feels that the enroll-
ment should be decreased to 750-
850.

Those who favor lowering the en-
rollment base their position largely
on the intangible values which re-
sult. from a small college fellow-
ship. They also make a_ strong
point in the matter of finances, at
least for the present.

One of the most important docu-
ments in the field is the Hamilton
(N. Y¥.) College report. Their con-
clusion was that operation at an
enrollment of less than 750 was
not economically feasible and that
any college that was doing so was
working under a serious financial
handicap. However, they felt that

Reader Answers Attack on
College’s Christian Atmosphere

Dear Editor,

In answer to R.E.G.'’s question,
“Where is the Christian Atmos-
phere which Davidson advertises?"’,
I would ask him to crawl out of his
shell to think and to look. This ap-
plies also to the many other stu-
dents who have the same outlook
as he has and to the student body
and faculty as a whole.

First | would ask, what con-
stitutes a Christian atmes-
phere? if it is a preconceived
idea of something someone is
going to hand to us, or some
thing which will benefit us to
our selfish ends at others good
will, a plece which supports
our own selfish ideas, |} am
afraid we will not find it for
there is not such @ state of
being. | would offer the opinion
that @ Christian stmosphere
consists in an unselfish con-
cern for one’s fellow-man and
his well being.

Are Bible courses ruining it? Or
are they presenting a larger pic-
ture of our faith? A childhood faith
is good—for a child; but a Chris-
tian faith grows as we and our
knowledge do. We can't live on
baby food all our lives.

As for Religious Emphasis Week
which is an example of all re-
ligious activity, it is what one
makes it, Religion is not dished
out on a platter, only the oppor-
tunity. Granted that at times one
side is all that. is officially pre-
sented, but this doesn’t stop us
from looking at both sides and the
factors leading to their and our
conclusions. Also we should look
at the procedure of using these
facts and the basis on which they
are built. Are diverse opinions
evil?

These have been only examples
of part of the advantage of David-
son and the manifestations of the
Christian atmosphere. I would
mention a few more. How many
schools offer a faculty of dedicated
Christians and God-related educa-
tion? How many schools offer the
faculty-student relationship oppor-
tunity that we have? Look at the
opportunity of Christian service.
Have you ever seen the relation-
ship between students at other
schools? These aspects of David-
son are not perfect or by them-
selves make it Christian; and no
one claims them to be, But one
must have a worthy target and a
desire to shoot a worthy score be-
fore one can shoot for that worthy
score.

—B. P. S.

A PEDESTAL
RELIGION ?

Dear Editor:

A letter from “R.E.G." in the last
issue of the Davidsonien aimed a
blast at the Christian atmosphere
which Davidson advertises. Par-
ticularly it discredited the Bible
classes “where God’s Holy Word
is taught to be filled with discrep.
ancies, and where ... faith...
is destroyed” and the seminar
groups “where we are told that
the Bible is the ‘Word of God on-
ly when one reads it and applies
it to oneself,”

is “R.E.G." afraid to put re-
ligion to any test? Does he
want it put on s pedestal to
serve only as a refuge for
peece of mind? He evidently
does not want it dragged down
to earth where he might en-
counter it unexpectedly.

The Bible he exalts is worth no
more than newsprint if it is not
applied to man. It provides great
religious insights, but what good
are insights locked within a book?

MISSING: TWO
PHYSICS COURSES

Dear Editor:

There has been much dissatisfac-

tion on the part of the students in
regard to the curriculum offered
by the college. The greatest con-
troversy seems to have been over
the establishment of a proposed
General Science course for non-
science majors.

But what about the curriculum
for science majors? The Chemistry
Department offers a fairly wide
variety of courses so that a stu-
dent wishing to major in Chemis-
try or Pre-Medicine may choose
whichever courses he desires and
possibly omit some. But the Phy-
sics majors have no choice at all.
The Registrar’s booklet entitled
“Courses of Instruction” gives the
requirements for a Major in Phy-
sics as “Physics 21-22, 31-92, and
any other eight hours in Physics.”
The conflict comes from the fact
that those “any other eight hours”
are not available except as one two-
hour, one three-hour, and one four-
hour course (Physics 61, 51, and
42, respectively). Phystes 52 (Di-
rect and Alternating Currents) and
Physics 62 (Theoretical Physics)
seem to be in the catalog purely
for the benefit of the oe

HD.

a rise of enrollment above 750
necessitated a loss of the values to
be received from a small college
atmosphere.

HARVARD AND YALE

The position of those who would
prefer a smaller enrollment is per-
haps most aptly stated in a report
which was written by a faculty
member who holds a very vocifer-
ous opinion on this subject and
from which I quote, “The best evi-
dence that there is a correlation
between the size of student body
and educational values comes from
Harvard and Yale. These universi-
ties, and others, have now divided
their undergraduate bodies into
what amounts to separate ‘small
colleges.’ The Headmaster of Lowell
House at Harvard wrote me (the
faculty member) concerning the
movement there and at Yale:

‘In both places we are getting
an increasing number of students
who derived nothing but the bene-
fits of the formal curriculum for
their time at college. They were
men who spent three, and some-
times four, years without making
any friends, and the friendships
when made were increasingly mat-
ters of small groups. The primary
object then, was to provide archi-
tectural forcing beds for extra-
curricular effects which had come
without conscious effort when

AROUND THE WORLD

these two places were small col-
leges in small towns dominated by
the college.” —

“Davidson is about to throw
away what Harvard and Yale have
spent millions to achieve.”

The article then proceeds to out-
line various sociometric tests which
would indicate that the enrollment
should not rise above the level of
750 and concludes by outlining
some of the intangible values
which are preserved as student
tradition. Among these are student
democracy, the importance of re-
ligion, respect for authority and
tradition, mutual respect and trust,
and good manners.

There are on the other hand a
large number of Davidsonians who
would like to see the enrollment
rise to 1000 or even higher. They
point out the impending rise of en-
rollment and the responsibility
that Davidson has of educating both
the sons of her alumni and the
other qualified young men who
seek admission.

THE FINANCIAL QUESTION

From a financial standpoint
there are arguments both for and
against this position. The report
from the group of management en-
gineers who surveyed Davidson
several years ago as well as the
report of the Committee on Church
Related Colleges of the Synod of
North Carolina recognized that as

far as major physical facilities
were concerned (classrooms, gym-
nasium, ete.) that Dayidson could
adequately handle an enrollment
of 1000 students.

From another standpoint, how-
ever, the situation is not so satis-
factory. At the present time David-
son has an endowment ef almost
$8 million, or approximately S$B9,-
000 per student. The desirable en-
dowment for a college like David-
son is considered to be $10,000 per
student, so that Davidson is some-
what behind in this goal now. This
makes it perfectly clear that if the
enrollment increases, the endow-
ment must also increase, or the
ee Standard of education will
all,

It has been estimated by in-
formed sources that an additional
endowment of $2 million would be
essential if present educational
Standards were to be maintained
with an enrollment of 1000 stu-
dents. A feeling of the trend of
opinion at this time would indi-
cate that the enrollment will be
raised to 1000 students within the
next few years but only after the
necessary additional funds are
raised to bring the endowment to
its optimum level.

This is a time of action for those
who feel strongly in cither direc-
tion and should be a time of
thought for every member of the
Davidson family.

MODERN TOWER OF BABEL

By JOHN TROTTI

A modern version of the Tower
of Babel lies behind the bloody
riots of India today. India is in-
ternally divided into 14 major
languages and 700 dialects. Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s plan
to relieve this tangle of tongues
brought about the biggest politi-
cal upheaval since the 1947 Hindu-
Moslem religious massacres.

Both Hindi and English are rec-
ognized as official national lang-
uages now, but the constitution
States that only Hindi will remain
by 1965. This presents certain pro-
blems in that only one half of
India’s 300 mil-
lion people un-
derstand Hindi.
Due to the re-
cent British
rule, English is
now the com-
mon communi-
cation from re.
gion to region,
therefore hun-
dreds of government officials
and clerks will have to learn a new
language.

The national language problem
is small because of its long term
program, but the local conflicts
have harassed the government
since its independence. State ap-
peals for new internal boundaries
according to language prompted
Nehru’s plan, though its applica-
tion has been almost universally
received with hostility.

HOSTILE MARATHAS

The first and most serious riots
have occured in Bombay—the weal-
thiest, most modern, and second
largest city of India. Bombay's 16
million Marathas are demanding
their own state with Bombay as
capital. These Marathi-speaking
people are the proud descendents
of the warrior race that once ruled
India from coast to coast. The op-
posing 11 million Gujarati-speak-
ing people who now rule Bombay
Politics were encouraged by the
British to control business while
the Maratha warriors were sup-
pressed. Therefore the Marathas
dislike their socially inferior econo-
mic oppressors. In this crisis,
Nehru proposed that the Bombay
Province (equal in size to Cali-
fornia) be divided into two separate
states and Bombay itself be ruled
by the government in New Delhi.

Chief Minister Desai foresaw
Communist intervention in this is-
sue and seized 435 Communist, So-
cialist, and United Maratha Party
leaders; however hundreds of thou-
sands of Maratha workers left their
jobs crying,“Death to Nehru” and
joined in bloody rioting. Commu-
nist influence reveals itself most
clearly in the Marathas’ attacks on
Gandi and nonviolence, the burning
of effigies of Desai, and the
hanging of old shoes on Nehru's
picture (a measure of high con-
tempt).

NEHRU RETALIATES ¢

When 118 Maratha members of
Bombay’s 315 member state legis-
lature threatened to resign, Nehru
countered with the threat of po-
litical excommunication. After a

Trotti

meeting at Poona, the 118 elected

to stick with the party. Nehru took ~

this firm measure because it was
the unity of the Congress that won
independence and, too, this would
encourage India’s factions not /to
resort to violence.

The rioting has spread to Orissa,
Bihar, Calcutta, Punjab, and New
Delhi. Each struggles with its
neighbor for more territory than
the new boundaries give. With this
violence, strikes, and threats by
India’s many states in all quarters,.
India has reverted to its old local
feelings and disputes which it was
hoped independence would unite.
Despite anti-Nehru Communist ac-
tivity, there has been no talk of
disunion. However the Communists
are pleased by the prospect of mob-
ocracy supplanting democracy and
are using all means to provoke a

Question: How is the exemina-
tion schedule set up?

Answer: With the exception of
the R.O.T.C. and Mathematics De-
partments’ exams, the examina-
tions have been revolving accord-
ing to schedule in a cycle over the
past several years. Through special
permission, the R.O.T.C. Depart.
ment has been given the perpetual
exam positions of last in the
Winter semester and first in the
Spring term. Conversely the Mathe-
matics Department, acting also as
a unit, has been given first posi-
tion in the Winter exam schedule
and final place in the Spring
exams.

The rest of the examinations are
listed according to the class hour,
and are rotated each semester in
groups of two, with the last two
of each period becoming the first
two, inverted, of the succeeding
examination period. The exams in
the middle of the period move
down accordingly. The occurrence
of certain mornings and afternoons
having no exams scheduled, such
as Monday morning, is always con-
stant, and the occasion of three
exams in a row, unavoidable since
there are only eight days allotted
for exams, is held until the end of
the period to permit a maximum
of time for preparation.

Question: Are colfeges ranked
scholasticaily on 2 nation-wide
scale? If so, where does Davidson
stand on the list?

Answer: There are certain pub-
lishers of college guide books
which sometimes attempt to rate
colleges. However, I know of no
responsible accredited agency
which does so. So many factors are

parent friendliness of the recent
Russian visit, Nehru realizes that
these outbreaks are Communist

Some say that the gravest weak.
ness of the Nehru plan is that two
Communist strongholds will be
united in one state and thus have
an excellent chance of carrying
the next election in that state.

The nation is at an uneasy state
of tension and an ominous curfew
hangs over most of the land. This
division of the tongues is a vital
issue with which Nehru’s govern-
ment must contend if the union is
to be preserved from the threat of
a Communist wedge of separation.
Perhaps the Russian visitors smiles
were the result of Communist pleas-
ure at the cracks in India’s union

munist intervention.

Question: It has been called to
our attention that the Ofts Lectures
are to be held this year. Exactly
when ere they to be given, and
who hes been asked te speak? What
will the general theme for the 1956
Otts Lectures be?

Answer: The 1956 Otts Lectures
will be given on May 8, 9, and 10,
with Dr. George Arthur Buttrick
of the Harvard Divinity School de-
livering the series. Dr. Buttrick was
formerly pastor of the Madison
Avenue Presbyterian Church in
New York and taught at Union
Theological Seminary there. He is
Commentary Editor and contributer
to The Interpreter’s Bible.

Not all the details of the lectures
have been worked out yet. Dr.
Buttrick will probably speak five
or six times during the three days.
-His subject has not yet been an-
nounced.

Details will be released through
the Davidsonian as soon as plans
are completed.

Question: Is the Interfraternity
Council‘s place in controiling Hell
Week, or Hell Week itself, to be
changed this year?

Answer: The opportunity of gov-
erning and controlling Hell Week
has again been given to the Inter-
fraternity Council. The IFC is
working with the Faculty Commit-
tee on Fraternities and will present.
