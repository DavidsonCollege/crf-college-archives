Students Buck Parents, But Nixon Still Wins Straw Vote

Nixon 307; Humphrey 255; Wallace 24

By CHARLES McEWEN
Associate Editor

Nixon won it.

In ‘the Wednesday straw balloting, the Nixon-
Agnew ticket polled 307 student votes; Humphrey-
Muskie, 255; and Wallace-LeMay, 24.

Students showed a decided shift to the left from
their strongly pro-Nixon parents.

But among faculty members voting, Humphrey
got 40 votes, compared to Nixon’s 18 and Wallace’s
one.

The voting was sponsored by THE DAVIDSONIAN,
in cooperation with the student Senate.

ounting both the faculty and student vote to-
gether, Nixon had 51 percent of the 645 votes cast.
Humphrey pulled 45 percent and Wallace 4 percent.

The percentages were little different when the
student vote is figured separately. Of the 586 students
voting, Nixon received 52% percent, followed by
Humphrey with 43% percent and Wallace with 4 per-
cent.

ODK Recognizes

Only in the junior and senior classes did Hum-
phrey receive a majority. The juniors gave Humphrey
50 votes to Nixon’s 46, while the seniors gave Hum-
phrey 81 votes to Nixon’s 46.

The results were just the reverse in the freshman
and sophomore classes. Nixon pulled 119 freshman
votes to Humphrey's 73; sophomores voted 96-48 in
favor of Nixon.

Wallace received 11, two, three, and seven votes
in the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior classes,
respectively.

Four students did not mark their classes on their
ballots. Of these, three voted for Humphrey and one
for Wallace.

When students expressed their opinions last
spring in the Choice ’68 primary, Nixon trailed Min-
nesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, who polled 39 per-

Te -

cent to the Republican’s 23 percent.

Senator Robert Kennedy polled 13 percent at the
time. Faculty members did not vote in the Choice ’68
balloting.

In a 1964 student vote, Republican nominee Barry
Goldwater edged out Lyndon Johnson in the student
vote, but the faculty went heavily for the Democrat,
as it did this year.

Students were also asked to give their parents’
preferences in the presidential race. According to the
poll, 701 parents will vote for Nixon, 266 for Hum-
phrey and 86 for Wallace. Ninety-two students indi-
cated that they did not know whom their parents
favored. -

Nixon polied 6144 percent, Humphrey 23 percent
and Wallace 7% percent of the parents’. vote. Eight
percent listed ‘“‘don’t know.”

By class, 239 freshman parents will vote for Nixon,
77 for Humphrey and 32 for Wallace.

For sophomore parents, 191 were listed as Nixon
voters, compared with 53 for Humphrey and 19 for
Wallace.

In the junior class 109 parents will vote for Nixon,
66 for Humphrey and seven for Wallace.

For senior parents, 162 will ballot for Nixon, 70
for Humphrey and 18 for Wallace.

Twenty-nine freshmen did not know their parents’
preferences, compared with 21, 32 and 10 for sopho-
more, junior and senior parents, respectively.

By party, 169 students listed themselves as Re-

publicans, compared to 176 Democrats, 223 indepen-
dents and four members of the Wallace organization,
the American Independent Party.
; By percentage, 2914 percent of the students vot-
ing are Republicans, 3042 percent are Democrats, 39
percent are independents and one percent are Ameri-
can Independent Party supporters.

Spencer: ‘Sympathetic
To Coeducation Idea’

By JOHN McLEAN
Staff Writer

“My position at this point
is that I am sympathetic to
the idea of coeducation,"’ re-
ported Dr. Samuel R. Spencer
to Monday night's Open End
discussion.

“I have not come te an
absolute conclusion on the
matter of coeducation. . .
because I would like to know
something about the facts,
showing what would be in-
volved here in terms of ec-
onomics as well as social
patterns and everything
else.”

It was with this note of

cautious optimism that Spen- —

cer answered students’ ques-
tions about Davidson's pre-
sent and future.

About 70 students attended
the Open End, and most of
their questions concerned
Spencer's attitudes toward
areas under study by the
joint student-faculty-trustee
commissions.

Spencer noted that though
fraternities have been an
essential part of the social
pattern, there is a question
as to whether this is the best
system. He warned that ‘‘we
cannot assume that fraterni-
ties have a place automatic-
ally.”

Turning to the problem of
faculty integration, Spencer
promised that the college
would actively recruit Negro
professors and clerical per-

Others
To Be

Chosen

Staff Writer

Student members of the
five advisory commissions
proposed by President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr. were ap-
pointed by the student Sen-
ate at its meeting Tuesday
trom large lists of students
who signed up to be consid-
ered.

Selected to the Commis-
sion on Church Relationship
were juniors Tom Norwood,
Ken Crews and William
Brown. Juniors Pat Bray
and Mac Davis will serve
on the Commission on Co-
education with senior Joe
Murphy.

The only sophomore on
any commission, James
Parks, was selected with Joe
Kilpatrick, a junior, and
Larry Slade, a senior, to the
Commission on Extra-Cam-
pus Responsibilities.

Seniors Kerry Keith, Joe
Kearfoot. and Rocky Cross-
white were named to the
Commission on Intercollegi-
ate Athletics.

Junior Peter Hobbie and
seniors Al Varner and Bay-
ard Miller will serve on the
Commission on Social Pat-
terns.

The commissions will be-
gin work as soon as the
faculty and trustee members
are elected. The 10 elected
faculty members have been
chosen for two weeks; how-
ever, delays in the appoint-
ment of the other five mem-
bers by Dean of Faculty
Frontis W. Johnston have
postponed the announcement
of the faculty commission
members.

Walter L. Lingle Jr., presi-
dent of the Board of Trustees,

much of the time since the
trustee meeting Oct. 11 and
has not completed selection of
the trustees to be on the

Carter: On Forceful Senate,
Himself, Successes, Issues

By DANNY WHITE

Covey Carter is satisfied.

As a senior senator, Carter
said, ‘There is a definite
need for forceful student
leadership in the Davidson
cemmunity, and I am satis.
fied that the SGA Senate is
providing this leadership.”

Carter had more to say.
both about himself and the
issues before the senate, for
this first in a series of oc-
casional interviews with
Senate leaders.

“I am enthusiastic about
the accomplishments of the
Senate,” Carter said. ‘‘The
senators are exceptional peo-
ple who are willing to put
their thoughts and actions to
work for the student body.”

Scott Announces 5 Cuts;
No Make-Ups Allowed

Freshmen and sophomores
will receive five cuts per
term in physical education,
but with no make-ups, Ath-
letic Director Dr. Tom Scott
announced Tuesday.

The new cut limit replaces
a previous limit of two per
term.

The five cut limit brings
physical education into line
with the otherwise universal
cut Limit of 25 per cent.

Until last semester, stu-
dents were allowed five cuts
a semester and four make-
ups. The faculty raised the
limit to 11 cuts and no make-
ups during the spring.

“No makeups will be al.
lowed and no medical ex-
cuses will be issued by the
college physician for minor
ailments not requiring dis:
qualification from physical
education,” said Scott.

Hall Association as the ma-
jor successes of this year's
Senate. ‘‘We have completed
some. of our major objec-
tives, but because of this we
must not let up now but con-

tinue our present pace of
achievements. ”*

Addressing himself to some
of the major Issues which
will face the Senate In the

future, Carter took a con-
servative viewpoint that has
marked his past stands on
issues.

When asked about his views
on the question of voluntary
ROTC which the Senate will
consider at its Tuesday meet.
ing. Carter took a rather
ambivalent position.

“I am opposed to requir-
ing ROTC for freshmen and
sophomores, but I still back
the ROTC program as it is
at Davidson because it would
be impossible to train good
Army officers unless they
went four years. In other
words, the advanced pro-
gram would be hurt if the
first two years were com-
pulsory.

“Anyway, the incoming
freshmen are. not interested
in avoiding the draft and the
two years in ROTC draw
them closer to the facts of
the situation so they can
make a decision about ad-
vanced ROTC,” Carter said,
indicating that he will sup-
port the present set-up.

Concerning the question of

more extensive recruiting of
Negro students, Carter ex.
pressed concern that the
Negroes might not measure
up to the present admission
standards.

“The recruiting must be

dents, and to no exten, should
we lower our requirements
to admit Negroes. b cause

sentment and ten on
