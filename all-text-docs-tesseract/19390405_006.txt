STUDENTS TO SHOW ART

~ COUNCIL STATEMENT

[Continued from Page One]
their justifiable right of ap-
pealate session of the stu-
dent council, This .was ac-
cordingly held during the
evening of March 31 and
continued the morning of
April 3, at which time all
testimony, ballot tabulation,
minutes, proposals, etc., of
the student council were
bared to those sitting in and
full explanation made for all
action taken. These groups
were then allowed to intro-
duce further testimony and
argument in the hope that
more and deeper informa-
tion may accrue to the coun-
cil to aid in their decision.

After these meetings, the
student council rescinded all
previous motions and de-
cisions and proceeded to
weigh the case, using the
contribution of both the
first investigation and of
the ensuing appeal to render
their decision. Because of
prevalent misunderstanding,
the student council defines
a combine or union as “any
individual influencing or
group swapping of votes
for, any. particular candidate
or candidates in return for
past or future  considera-.
tion.” Naturally groups will
be held responsible for the
action of individuals within
that group, and contrary to
the opinion of some, this
regulation restricting .com-
bines or unions, applies to
fraternity and non-fratern-
ity men alike or to any
group, individual, or indi-
vidual within a group which
shall take it upon itself to
use these methods in our
elections. Guilt of violation
of this regulation shall be
ascertained — by student
council investigation, using
testimony and ballots analy-
and requiring a two-
thirds vote of all council-
men present for convictions.
Pwffshment shall be of the
discretion of the council.

In view of the widespread
misinterpretation -of ‘the
definition combine or
union, The  Davidsonian
election will resume Tues-

Chairman John Reisner states
that the committee nsed a new
method of collecting ideas this year.
Each member of the graduating
class was asked to contribute some
idea. The gift was scheduled to be,
decided upon before spring holi-
days, but suggestions were so slow
that the committee has not yet de-
cided. Also, a new method for col-
lecting money was used this year.
The fees were paid to the treasur-
er at mid-term when the seniors
paid their registration fees.

In the past such gifts to the
school as the illuminated clock on
Chambers, the portrait of Dr. Hard-
ing, and the campus drinking foun-
tain have been made.

error was made by the Cat infield.

On Tuesday, March 28, David-

the fray which was too much for
the Queen City boys. Hicks, Mc-
Lean, and Thomas did the hurling
for the locals.

Louis Hipp, Recorder, An-

The fight over freshman
caps is at long last finished,
for this year anyway. In chap-
el on March 23, Louis Hipp,
recorder of the Court of Con-
trol, announced that the “rats”
would no longer have to wear
their little red caps.

Following announcement,
bedlam broke loose. Freshmen
yelled with delight; upperclass-
men, with dismay (or relief), The
Court of Control has had its hands
full this year keeping the freshmen
attired as becomes their low es-
tate.

This is the earliest any class has
been allowed to stow away, give
to girls, or burn their caps in sev-
eral years. Last year’s class was
required to wear the caps until the
middle of April. Other classes have
been more or less the same.

Our second duty as citizens of the
spiritual commonwealth is to live a
life of service and sacrifice. We
should have a desire to help the
sick, poor, needy, and even the
wicked and repulsive. This phil-
anthropic duty is also applied to
the church.

Our third duty as citizens of the
spiritual commonwealth, is to “hun-
ger and thirst after righteousness.”
This should apply to business deal-
ings, along the Golden Rule inter-
national relations, t6 discover the
brutality of war; and in the treat-
