THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 19, 1923

| Wildcat Grid Men

Captain E. S. Faison

Elias Sampson Faison, ‘Lias, belongs .to
that class of men who play a steady game,
and who excel by natural ability. Coming
to Davidson in the fall 1920 from the
town of Faison, N.C. ‘Lias got got off to
a good start by making the varsity squad,

year, and his steady going has not allowed

Ways playing a good game at right end. His
defensive work has been outstanding, and his

leadership, and “Lias comes forth this year
as Captain of the Wildeat squad. In the

riage, which distinguishes all citizens of that
state at Davidson,

Strange say, has

Mason brought with him
a reputation which he has ably lived up to
since.

Mason came to. Davidson and so endeared
himself in the hearts of his classmates
that he was cleeted President of the Fresh
man class. This position he ably filled even
though his position was often difficult and
his way was rough,

In his Freshman year he made a place on
the squad which gave him much experience
Which he was to use so well later.

In his Sophomore year, Mason shone
forth in his true light. He quickly carned a
berth on the regular team as center and

guard. In cach game he fought with the
characteristicWildeat fight and dash, A bad
knee kept him out of the game part of the
time, much to the disappointment of stu-
dents.

In his Junior year Mason again donned
the moleskins and again showed himself a
true Wildeat in his fight and steady playing.
Quick to diagnose the opponents’ play, he
was in the thick of every fight.

At the present time Mason has shown up
even better in the games of the 1923 season.
As center he is the pivot on which the of-
fense plows through the opposing line. On
defense he is a stone-wall by which the
Wildcat line crushes the attacks of the op-
ponents.

defeated by Carolina it does not mean that
they are giving up. The first of the season

has upset the dope. Carolina outplayed the
Methodists, and the result of the Carolina-
