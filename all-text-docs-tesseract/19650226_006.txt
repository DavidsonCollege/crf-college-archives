Miss Frost In Love

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A real live Yankee turned
up in chapel Thursday. Dr.
Lesley Frost, daughter of
Robert Frost, is from New
Hampshire, and by the time
she was through speaking
every one of her somewhat
breathless listeners could
have guessed as much.

Steve Bunch, president of
the College Union, has an-

Scott Narrowly Loses
Race For State Positio

Tom Scott, a Davidson junior, was narrowly defeated in his bid for vice-presi-|
dent of the State Student Legislature of North Carolina at the organizations conven-

tion at the old State House

This marked the first time in
recent years that. a Davidson
student has run for ‘a state of:
fice at the convention. The win-
ner in the final election held
Saturday afternoon was Charles
Daye, a student at North Caro-
lina: College.

Election of officers -climaxed
two days of legislative action
and campaigning. Scott's name
had been placed in nomination
by Davidson delegate Chuck
Matthews, who also delivered
the nominating speech. The sec-

SPRING, 1965

Eight From Amherst
To Initiate Exchange

By RON SNOW
Davidsonian Steff Writer

- Eighth Amherst College students will be guests
of the college from March 21-27 in the initiation of
an exchange program between Davidson and Am-
herst. This is the fourth year that Amherst has work-
ed this exchange with various Southern colleges.

The delegates will stav in the dorms, eat at the
fraternity houses and the College Union on a rota-
tional basis, and attend classes and seminars as they
choose. It is expected that Davidson will offer a host-
type arrangement’ in which one or a few students
would be. responsible for one of the exchanges dur-
ing his stay here.

There is no formal meeting or panel scheduled
with the students; but Tommy Heffner, program co-
ordinator, said that there might be an Open End dis-
cussion with them one night of that week.

When asked if there would be any Negroes in
the group, Heffner replied, “Amherst is integrated,
and the etter said the delegation would be repre-
sentative.”

The program is expense-free, the host school
providing room and board. The students pay their
own transportation to and from the exchange school.
The students from Amherst are coming during the
second week of their spring vacation.

Heffner said that 24 Davidson students have
thus far expressed an interest in going to Amherst
during their spring vacation which begins March 27.
Anyone inter in the program should contact
Heffner or any member of Student Council, and from
the list, eight persons will be selected within the next
week. Transportation to the Massachusetts college
will be provided by Davidson College.

Heffner also asked that anyone interested in
keeping one of the students in his room or serving
as a host, should contact him soon.

on Friday and twice on Satur-'
day. Some of the bills which!
passed both houses were a bill |
submitted by Elon College re-|
quiring. four years of physical!
education in public high schools:
in North Carolina, and a resolu-
tion submitted by UNC to estab-
lish a state lottery, with pro-
ceeds to be used for improving
education in North Carolina.

Davidson's delegates voted in
favor of these bills, with the ex-
ception of Beard, who voted
against the physical education
bill.

NOT ENOUGH TIME

The Davidson contingent had
hoped to present a bill calling
for the repeal of the ‘Speaker
Ban Law.”’ but there was not
sufficient time at the legislative
sessions for them to do so.

In the election of officers Sat-
urday each representative had
one vote. Jane Levine from |
Duke University was elected
president, becoming the first
girl ever to hold the office.

‘Davidson cast the deciding
vote in this close election by
supporting Miss Levine. Scott
noted that there was a good deal
of bloc voting by the various
schools in this and in the other.
elections.

; POLITICS!

Scott explained that there was
quite.a bit of ‘politicking’ done
at the convention. and that all.
the delegates were involved in|
lobbying. campaigning. and de-:
bating. John Hutcheson’'s debat-
ing in the Senate merited par-
ticular praise from Scott.

A combo party held on Thurs: ;
dav night. and various causes, '
meetings. and campaigning kept ,
most delegates up all night talk- |
ing with and meeting other dele- '
gates. |

Seott commented tongue-in-
cheek that several of the female
delegates saw a distinct likeness
between John Hutcheson and ac-
tor Robert Mitchum, affording
the Davidson contingent a big
laugh.

Sco’t expressed his hope that
Chuck Matthews. who ‘‘did an
outstanding job on his seconding
speech and debating as a mem-
ber of the House,” will run for
an office in the State Student
Legislature next year.

QUITE HAPPY

Although disappointed that he
was defeated, Scott was quite
happy with the entire program
and commented that he hopes
Davidson will continue to show
an interest in state college poli-
ties.

Scott concluded that ‘‘the Da-
vidson delegates did a real fine
job in all the areas which they
entered at the meeting,” and
that they all “regarded the ex-
perience as quite valuable.”

The Theatre of Concern is a
touring company of two, formed!
tn 1962 by Dietz and his wife
Saadra. Since the inception
of the theatre they have staged
more than a dozen different,
plays—most of them contempo-
rary, some controversial, and
many comic. ;

With less than a dozen New:
York actors who have traveled
with them from time to time,
the Dietzes have performed in:
churches, colleges, and univer- :
sities from North Dakota to’
Tennessee and are now en route:
to the West Coast. }

The work of the Dietzes has:
taken them to theatre workshops
in Pittsburgh and Chicago and
to taping ‘sessions for TV series
in Philadelphia and St. Louis.
Together the Dietzes have pro
duced an expensive spectacle |
with a cast of over 100 players:
called “The Town Went Boom.”
They have also toured alone:
for over a year with a_ two-
character program called
‘How're Things And So Forth?”

During their travels, and at
their New York home. they re-
hearse. Norman writes, devel-
oping much of the material for
the theater itself. and Sandra
costumes the show.

Terry To Explore
Bible Scholarship

Chaplain WIN Terry’ will
preach at vespers Sunday eve-
ning.

“What I'm going to preach,
about—I don't want to “give it a
title.’’ Terry explained, but the
sermon will concern the difficul-
ties biblical scholarship causes
for biblical faith. It is a prob-
lem—which I think is a real
problem for Davidson students.”

Most students come to David-
son viewing the Bible as the au-
thority for their faith. When
they encounter inconsistencies
and “‘errors’’ of a sort, revealed
by Biblical scholarship in their
Bible courses, ‘‘the ground of
their faith is knocked out from
under them," he explained.

“It realy amounts to ‘What
do we mean when we say the

Bible is the word of God’,"’|

Terry concluded.

Sunday evening's service is
part of a new plan to give the
chaplain more opportunity to
preach at vespers. Many feel
that he is better qualified to
speak about the problems of
Davidson students than others
would be since he lives on cam-
pus. °

that life was really opened up
through art. especially poetry.

Poetry, of course, is peculiar-
ly the heritage of Miss Frost's,
and she had a lot to say about
it. She was convinced that the
knowledge of poetry leads to
adventure, and she illustrated

ca

the idea with several incidents
from her own life.
‘““Happenstance,”' according to
the speaker, ‘is something that
has to happen because of our
wishful thinking.” Wishful
think:ng wiil fmally meet op-
portunity, and when it does
opportunity may be seized.
To illustrate her po:nts, Miss
Frost recited a number of
poems by her father and others.

Opinion varied as to the quality sent
of her reading, but students duce

were unanimous in their amaze-

ment at her prodigious memory. ;

So now Davidson College is
included fn the world in which
Miss Frost is renowned. Some
of her audience delt that her
presentation did not do justice
to some of her material. None-
theless, the number of her lis-
teners who were a sleep was
smaller than usual, and those
who remained awake were re-
warded with one of the year's
more interesting chapel pro-
grams.

Gary Martin heads the com-
mittee which was formed to in-
vestigate the present ethical di-
lemma of censorship. Martin
pointed out that ‘‘We do not
want anyone to get the idea that
we are going down to the Hub
to clean house.”

He commented that, “Since
it is such a controversial issue
which all students will be faced
with in their respective com-
munities, we are merely trying
to acquaint the student body
with the different viewpoints of
the issue. This program will be
followed up by the coming of
Paul Goodman through the YM-
CA series on sex.”

Goodman, a writer by occu-
pation, who had some of his
philosophy on sexual mores pre-
sented in the February issue of
Playboy, will present the view- |
point opposing censorship.

The issue was first brought to
light on the Davidson campus by
Mrs. Ethel Nash last week, as
she emphatically opposed cen.
sorship and even went so far as
to say that ‘‘some degree of por-
nography is good for us.”
