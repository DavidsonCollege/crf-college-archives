“What do you think of our ‘pres-

what'changes, if any, would you sug-

Jim Owens, Senior:

“I think the present organization

of the student council, student con- |
stitution, and set-up is very good. |
I believe the change in chapel sid]

step forward. I would like to see a

the bulletin board. So many stu- |

dents fail to read the announce-
ments because they forget to go by
the board or just don’t try to push
through the crowd there at chapel
time. The two chapel periods a
week given to the student body
.can be used to good advantage.
Many phases of student life can be
emphasized in these meetings which
otherwise would receive little at-
tention, %

election of a President for the Jtin-

was never as much as half the class,
although this officer was to be con-

the whole class.

“This gross-indifference is to be
deplored, and I hope that by use of
the new chapel program set-up, by
which means the true functions of |

a greater interest can be engender-

those who govern him will feel a

Ivey Steward, Junior:

“The student government at Da-

honor and integrity of each mem-

r of the student body. Upon
this assumption, our present set-
up seems the best possible one that
