YMCA Mid-Term Reports

This is a mid-term report of the

YMCA that has been prepared from| get very closely.

the minutes of the verbal reports of
the members of the Y Cabinet.

President of the Y, Hubert Can-
non, prepared a report, from this
report, in the form of a speech
and gave it to the trustees at their
recent meeting.

Gene Craven, Treasurer, had
this report to make.

The Y.M.C.A. budget for the year
1962-53 is $11,800.00.

In general, the Cabinet posts
have spent approximately half of
their budgets for the year, or
somewhat under. One-half of the
benevolent fund has been assign-
ed. General operating expenses
have been less than the budget
for the first semester. An item of
$2,250 was set aside for part of
the salary of the Y Secretary. Since
this amount was not used this year,
one-half of this amount was ap-
plied to a new car for ¥.M.C.A. use.
Another item of this budget is 4,-
600 for the Y.M.C.A. Gift Fund.

ly critical bludgeoning of American colleges, we agree with
Mr. Bromfield on two points — the average college professor
is financially undernourished and there are too many per-
sons in college, for social or parental purposes, who are here
to avoid rather than acquire an education.
Education today is of the supermarket variety — stu-

a comprehensive education, and the college degree today
commonly comes in an assortment of varieties and values.

good enough by one of the Caro-

Before coming to Davidson, Dud-
ley attended Reynolds High School
in Winston. His senior year the
team took the state championship,
but Joe was only an obscure second-
stringer. As a freshman, he failed
to show much sign of promise,
though some improvement was
shown the following year. Last sea-
son he began to come into his
own and to show flashes of the bril-
liance he has displayed so consist-
ently this season. ;

After the VPI game tomorrow
night there will be no more college
basketball for Joe. But he hopes
to play on the Med school team
of the University of Pennsylvania
where he is already enrolled. There
he will follow in the footsteps of
Buddy Cheek, an alltime Davidson
great, who is graduating from Penn
Med school this spring.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1958

Howard Proctor: Davidson's
Answer To The Microphone

Some people are born with a sil-
ver spoon in their mouth. Howard
Proctor chose a brass ladle. He’s
best known around here not so
much for the quanity and regular-
ity of his word out-put, as for the
volume. Howard’s whisper has been
known to break delicate wine
giasses and chandeliers.

The odd part is, Howard usually
has something to say worth hear-
ing. He knows what he wants to
do, and usually does it. Right now
his far-reaching aim is psychology
graduate school, and his B+ aver-
age will help get him there. The
follow-up is to be an industrial
psychologist. If that’s what he
wants, you’d be foolish to bet he
won't make it.

Howard’s overflow shuts off al-
most completely when the conver-
sation works around to his personal
life. There’s a girl in it somewhere,
a Tallahassee lassie, and Howard
is shyly giving odds that he'll be
pinned inside of two weeks. She
was here for the dances and How-
ard (with Monk McGill) took her
back to Atlanta to catch a bus
back to Florida. That was Sunday
at 2:00 P. M. They ended up taking
her all the way back to school
(never underestimate the power of
a woman), came rolling into David-
son just in time for Monday classes
with some noisemakers they had
bought in a restaurant that didn’t
have any bathroom. I didn’t quite
get this, but I laughed politely and
got him started on his theater love.

In the next production he’s to be
Baxley, a bum who sponged off of
his wife's sister’s husband. He gave
me a few lines such as “Give Me
Adventure!” with gusto in his
unique timbre, and leaves fell off
near-by trees. I think if he had a
cavity in a tooth he would talk with
an echo.

When the time for cheerleader
elections came last year, the Green-
ville, N. C. KA’s name was the first
to be handed in. “I was just making
sure nobody would misspell my
name,” he now admits. The elec.
tion was as one-sided as Stalin’s

put the DeMille touch in cheerlead-
ing. There was the reincarnation of
Felix, the gangster entrance, the
Cathey-Hoyle sales promotion stunt,
the Alenda Lux boogie and the
acrobatic tricks. Remember his
speech right before the Furman

game? “The key element to foot-/. .

ball cheering is spontaneity .. .”
that’s as far as he got. “The rest
was unprintable anyhow”, he says.

His reputation is not only as an
undergraduate that can spout 5-
syllable words, for Proctor's zeal
and imagination have carried over
into other phases of D. C. life. He
led the KA’s to the Interfraternity
Sing title by putting the monotone
bows in the Chambers windows in-
stead of the chorus.

Adrian Bowen, George King and
Caypee Corners put up with How-
ard and his amature radio hobby
most of the time. They live at
Mrs. Little’s where Proc is now
busy making plans as head of the

But Proctor won't be doing any-
nore traveling for quite a while. He
got in some minor trouble a while
back and the dean made him pro-
mise not to leave campus for a
month. “I asked him if he didn’t
want me to stand in a corner too
. which didn’t go over to well
with the Deanie.”

Then Howard saw a friend half.
way across the: campus and yelled
to’ him. Leaves fell and Howard
was off, probably on another wild
scheme.
