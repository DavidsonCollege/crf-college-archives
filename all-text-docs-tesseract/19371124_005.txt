Géie McEver Expresses
Ideas on Subsidization

Fred Smith Upholds McEver’s |
Views on Athletic Sub- }

by Chet

Gene McEver, head
coach, accompanied
Chapman, assistant football
coach, and Conrad Frederick
Smith, went to Charlotte Mon-
day where’ McEver made
a talk before the Charlotte)
Association of Manufacturers’
Agents on “Athletic Subsidiza-

tion,”

“If we go back 50 years,” Mc-
Ever said, “we find football start-
ing as an intramural sport. The

time came when the teams wanted
outside competition. They asked the
colleges for appropriations for
equipment and they were refused.
The alumni of the colleges donated
the

coaches were needed, it was again

money needed, and when

the alumni who provided the money

to pay them. The alumni got hold
at the start.

“College alumni want to have
Winning teams. The alumni have
a hold on college football and the |
colleges can't get it back. They|
may never get it back.

“Every football team in the Unit-|

ed States is bidding for the public

favor. That is all right. But the|
college gets all of the boy's athletic |
ability and the boys get no educa: |
tion. The subsidized football play- |
er today does not graduate. When |
he is playing football, he is inter-|
ested in football, not his studies. |
If the college would force the boys

to work on their studies instead of
passing them on their work just so
they will be able to play, then sub-
sidization would be all right.
“The Southern Conference ruling
which asks the boy ‘Do you get |
aid primarily
your athletic ability’? forces the
boy who is an athlete to lie. The
colleges are mostly to blame for

outside because of |

all the publicity which gets out
about athletic subsidization. We
have to bear in mind that the

things are not as bad as they are
made out to be.”
