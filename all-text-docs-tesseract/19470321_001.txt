Art Work in Watts

College Show to be Held March
31 to April 3

From March 31 until April 3 the
annual Art Exhibit of Davidson
College will be held in the parlors
of Watts Dormitory. The exhibit,
to be composed for the most part
of student entries will be the first
in some years, having been discon-
tinued in 1943, as so many other
campus activities, due to the de-
pleted student body of the last four
years.

In addition to the student artis-
tic endeavor, there will be a group
of work from the faculty and fac-
ulty wives. In the past, this added
attraction has proven of great in-
terest to the college group.

Covers Wide Field

The work on exhibit will be of a
greatly varied assortment, in that
there will be no limitations as to
subject and medium. Exhibitors are
free to enter portraits, landscapes,
still life, and other sybjects, in any
chosen medium. Oil painting is ex-
pected to compose a large percent-
age of the exhibit, with much work
in charcoal, and pastels.

All Davidson College students,
faculty members and their wives
are eligible to enter the exhibit
which will be judged by a faculty
committee. This committee will be
announced some time in the near
future, and will select the best work
while a student vote will be taken
to.determine the students’ favorites
in the exhibit.

Entrance Rules Listed

The following rules will govern
entries; Exhibitors must be stu-
dents, faculty members, or faculty
wives. Each exhibitor will be lim-
ited to three entries. Medium and
subject is without limitation.

Anyone wishing to include work
in the exhibit may do so by contact-
ing the art staff of Quips and
Cranks, Henry Cathey, or Bill
Whitaker. Cathey may be con-
tacted by calling 5061.

Aged Chimney
Yields Secret

Contrary» to popular belief, the
time capsule was not a brain-child
of the 1939 World’s Fair Preserva-
tion for Posterity Committee. Cer-
tainly Arischoxstos, the mad pha-
roah of the Third Dynasty, hoped,
when he interred his sixteenth wife
all bedecked with rubies and ravens’
teeth, that some twentieth century
archaeoligist would uncover her
shroud and cop the priceless»treas-
ures therein. There must’ve been
others somewhere through the ages
who were thoughtful enough of
their descendants to leave relics.

But in the modern age, the ear-
liest time capsule must surely be
the one imbedded somewhere in the
putty and mortar of Eu Hall’s crum-
bling chimney. Ah, comes a cam-
pus mystery now uncovered! “It
has come to light recently that the
S. A. E. chapter of 1915, desiring
to be remembered, inserted in a
large milk jug the names of all the
Minervaites present plus several
treasured articles of the pre-World
War I era such as fur-lined jacket
straps, toothless combs, two-headed
pennies, et setterah. The divulger
of this long-suspended secret dis-
closed further that a curse would
descend upon any unqualified per-
son who desecrated the chimney or
attempted to recover the jug. No
one can be qualified unless he was
a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon. Society of Davidson’s class of
1915, and further, even one of the
few who can meet this requirement
must wait until sixty-six years after
1915 to attack the chimney and rob
it of its prize. In a special. an-
nouncement to members of the Da-
vidsenian present, F. A. Jackson,
college treasurer, announced that he

Musical Show
In Asheville

Playing two performances to
full houses, the Queens-Davidson
Music Departments presented “The
Pirates of Penzance” to the school
children of Asheville on Friday,
March 14.

The first performance was pre-
sented Friday morning in the Ashe-
ville city auditorium to the county
school children and the second to
an audience composed of the city
school children. The capacity of
the auditorium ,is approximately
3,500. During each performance
all seats were taken and all stand-
ing room, to the limit of the fire
laws, was taken by the spectators.
The estimated total attendance was
8,000.

Special Performances

Arriving at Asheville on Thurs-
day afternoon, the cast was almost
immediately prevailed on by Dr.
Grier Davis to sing some selections
from the operetta at a church din-
ner of several hundred ; people.
Soloists for ‘this occasion were
Frank Lowe, Bill Hutherland, and
Betty Barber. Middy Reynal and
his band of policemen also sang
selections.

The cast went up in two charter-
ed buses—one from Davidson and
the other from Queens. They spent
the night at the Assembly Inn in
Montreat and returned Friday

Seminary Men

Lead Vespers

Dr. Cunningham announced this
week that Sunday night Vespers
will be conducted by a deputation
from Union Theological Seminary
of Richmond, Va. These seminary
deputations constitute annually one
of the outstanding vesper services
of the year: ;

This year’s group is composed of
four men, three of whom are David-
son alumni. Fred Stair who grad-
uated here in 1989 is one of David-
son’s most outstanding alumni. In
his stay on the campus Stair was
president of the student body, an
outstanding football player, com-
mander of the R. O. T. C. batallion,
and a member of Phi Beta Kappa,
Omricon Delta Kappa, and the Y.
M. C. A. Cabinet. Stair served in:
the Army as an infantry major dur-
ing the war. His home is Knox-
ville, Tenn., and he is a seminary
student this year.

George”Hopper attended David-
son before the war during which
he served in the Navy. He then
attended the University of Virginia
and after graduation entered the
seminary where he is now a Junior.
Hopper is also active in the As-
sembly’s program for Westminster
Fellowship. He is the son of a mis-
sionary from Kwangju, Korea, and
plans to enter the mission field
after graduation.

W. R. Smith, III, also attended
Davidson. He hails from Chatham,
Va. He is a Senior at Union and
has been called to be pastor of the
Presbyterian church of Yadkinville,
N. C., after his graduation.

George Staples was graduated in
1940 from Presbyterian College in
Clinton, S.-C. He entered Union
after graduation but was. called into
the Army in 1942, where he served

as an infantry major.

By James Jackson
As told to E. Cailliet

This, the third of a series of
articles attempting to bring before
the student body some of the deeds
of valor and heroism recounted at
every opportunity amidst the hal-
lowed halls of traditional old David-
son is the war history of Gentle-
man Jim Jackson, the curse of Co-
lumbia, a valiant member of the
Army Air Corps.

Realizing when he received his
appointment to service in the wide
blue yonder that the life of carousal
he had led at Davidson was not con-
duct befitting an officer in the most
elite of the services, Jackson did
not. hesitate to put away childish
things and labored with such effort
to obtain the sophisticated polish
required of the successful aiah coah
man that after graduation he was
retained in the States for a num-
ber of months to instill the spirit
of the corps into younger trainees
and assigned to duty at Yuma, Ari-
zona.

“Live in Fame”

Success was rapid, and after 13
days Jackson was promoted to first
lieutenant, then two months later
to captain and assigned the difficult
job of lecturing to incoming classes
on correct wearing of the uniform.

One night returning from leave
in Yuma, where he had been toying
with a young lady whose first name
was Jeanne and whose last name
was not given, Jackson, his chest
covered with a gala display of rib-
boris including the American Thea-
tre, Good Conduct, and the Excel-
lent Scholarship Medal, with bronze
star in lieu of second Excellent
Scholarship Medal, came upon a
long line of enlisted men stretch-
ing around the block. Suspecting
some disturbance,.the dashing flight
officer strode to the head of the

line where a red cross, signifying

action aboye and beyond the call
of duty, was prominently displayed.

War Deeds of Flier

Disclosed on Campus

Scornful, Jackson was about to turn
away in disgust, when he noticed
a young candidate named Maloney,
a member of:his class who had ac-
quited a reputation for debauchery,
stumbling. bleakly out of the door.
Obviously the victim of a mental
quirk involving delusions of gran-
deur, candidate Maloney kept mut-
tering over and over, “Once a king
always a king, but once a knight
is enough.”
“Go Down In Flame”

Realizing that the boy was in
need of help, Jackson did the noble
thing, and throwing rank distinc-
tion to the winds, took him by the
shoulders and led him to a near-by
officers’ club, where he said, simply,
“You've got to pull yourself to-
gether, old man. An air corps man
never quits.” Spending the night
there together in the deep silence
of true friendship, broken only by
cries of “Right” as they read the
officers handbook together, and,
went out arm in arm to jump into
their ships and fly off into the cold
grey together. :

“Nothing Can Stop the A.A.C.”

In moments of crisis, such as the
visit of some general, Jackson now
a major was sent aloft'to supervise
bomb runs made by the students
as part of the demonstration. It
was during such a gruelling experi-
ence that the port engine ceased to
function, and the pilot’s voice,
fraught with tension, came over the
intercom, “She’s let us down, men.
Hit the silk.” Acting with the speed
and_precision..which_were-.the—re-
sult of months of intesive training,
Jackson bashed his head against an
airelon, jettisoned the left wing,
and with two fingers of the left
hand extended in the V for Victory
sign, lept through the open bomb
bay doors, when he noticed the
huddled form of a cadet frozen in
terror on the floor. Realizing that
to avert tragedy quick action was

Election Board,

Early Balloting

Monday marked the beginning of
a series of what seems to be hotly
contested elections, as the students
went to the polls to vote for their
student body officers. Chosen Mon-
day, to enter the final election March
18 were Hugh Hill, Jim Pittman,
and Heywood Brinegar, for presi-
dent; George Cheek, Ed Hopper,
Johnny Miller, and Car] Pahl for
vice president (two to be elected);
Bob Carson, Whit Cobb, Dick Glas-
gow, and Jake Wade for secretary-
treasurer.

At the first called meeting of the
elections board, Tommy Powell was
elected chairman, and he proceeded
to outline the duties of the mem-

By Ronny Dietrick

When asked the question congern-
ing this week’s poll one person gra-
ciously replied, “Why that is an ab-
surd question!” Nevertheless the
poll was taken and it is felt that
the results should be interesting
to all students. The question placed
in the lap of the student body this
week was, “Do you think that com-
pulsory Vespers should be abolish-
ed?” This question has “always
been a red hot issue around the
dormitories for as long as anyone
can remember, and is often vitupe-
rously discussed about seven-fifteen
p. m. on Sunday evenings.

In view of the fact that so many
people express their displeasure so
often and so vehemently on the sub-
ject of being forced to break a short
week end off early to return to
Chambers for.a compulsory sermon
it is surprising that the results, pro
and con, were as close as they were.
Also it was gratifying to note that
the Seniors, the class which has
been ‘here’ the longest, were gen-
erally in favor of retaining the com-
pulsory vesper system. This would
iridicate that the Seniors are both
more satisfied with Davidson as it
is and more familiar and attached
to its traditions.

In response to the question “Do
you think that compulsory Vespers
should. be-abolished?” the students
replied in, the following manner:

Per Cent

The section carrying (X) stands
for that percentage of students who

thought that compulsory Vespers
should be abolished, but qualified
their opinion by saying that the

student should be on his honor to g0
to church somewhere on Sunday.
Whether Davidson students would
have that much honor when placed
under such conditions is, indeed, a
L foot question.

Breaking down the results of the
poll into classes reveals that while
the Senior and Sophomore classes
favored retaining the present com-
pulsory system the Freshman and

Despite the fact that students
rant against compulsory Vespers it
probably never occurred to many of
them that Davidson might not~be
Davidson without the traditional
“tete a tete” every Sunday night.
Also few students’ seem to realize

that the number of cuts allowed a
semester equals about one third of
the number of vesper services a
semester. As someone so aptly
phrased it during the polling, “Grip-
ing about compulsory vespers at

Davidson is like griping about drill- |-

ing at a military school.”

Elected President
Leader Selected
In Close Ballots:

Outstanding Man Chosen For
Highest Campus Position
As a result of the closed ballot

final elections held on Tuesday,

March 18, Hugh Hill, a member

of the rising senior class, was

elected by the -required—majority
vote to the position of Student

Body President for the coming

year 1947-1948.

The original ballot included Jim
Pittman, Sam Tate, Lee Willing-
ham, Ed Lilly, Heywood Brinegar,

Maloney, and Robertson were eli-
mated on the first ballot, Monday,
March 17.

Hill, a native of Greensboro, en-
tered Davidson in the fall of 1941.
As-a freshman, Hugh was a mem-
ber of the editorial staff of The
Davidsonian and Varsity manager
of the football squad. During his
second year, 1942-'43, Hill was
chosen as Sophomore representative
on the Student Council, and. also
was elected to the office of Vice-
President of the Student Body for
the ‘folliwing year 1943-'44. He was
unable to occupy the latter posi-
tion, however, as -he left Davidson
with the Enlisted Reserve Corps. in
March, 1943,

“Hugh spent the next three years
with the Army Medical Corps in
the United States and Europe. At-
tached to the Ninth Army field
hospital, he served overseas for
Seyenteen months, stationed at one
time or another in practically all of
the European countries reached by
the

war.

Re-entering Pavidson —in June,
1946, Hugh immediately renewed his
interest and activities in ‘student

organizations. He is at present the
