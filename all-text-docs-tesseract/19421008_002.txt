Guilt . .. ‘

Most of the pranks of each freshman “2

class are overlooked and“smiled at by
the upper classes and excused by the fac-
ulty or grounds of thoughtlessness or
boyish spirit. Most of these acts can in
justice be so elassified.

There is nothing in the Davidson defi-
nition of either class or school Spirit,
however, that includes the detacing of

college property, Partieularth—Chambers—

building.

_ The Bideously painted numerals on the
columns of that edifice do not represent
a material bict on the building half ‘so
much as a blot om the character of the
entire student body, both clearly visible
to _the most casual passerby travelling
through the town,

I:ven the greenest first year man could
not have failed to gather from his orien
lation training and from his knowledge
of Davidson's reputation that this is not
the sort of thing that men do here. It
is more typical of a class “C” high school.

it fas been suggested that the respon-
sible party was not a freshman. If this
is the case, then we have occasion to be
even more ashamed. We could possibly
waive a freshman’s guilt by pretending
that ‘pe had not been around much and
did not know any better. Any upper
classman who would pick this method of
incriminating the Freshman class is
well, inexcusable.

-1£ whoever did the painting is proud
oS bis work, we sincerely hope that he or
they will have the courage to stand up
for it. If not we hope they will show the
intestinal fortitude to take the blame and
punishment like men and not saddle the

“responsibility for their deeds on an inno-
cent class.

Elections ...

The Publications Board is now work-
ing On a recommendation to the student
council, the necessity of which:has be-
come evident ever since the shortened
educational program was instituted.

From all appearances there are to be
only three classes in college within the
next few years, possibly months. Re-
quirements for election to the editorship
of the publications, in fact to all campus
offices, will have to be revised accord-
ingly.| .

Those who have used the excuse that
there was no use trying owt for these
activities because there was litle possi-
bility of their being in sehool long enough
to be eligible for ahe more important of-
frees should realize that in reality the
situation is reversed. They will be re-
sponsible tor these offices a year earlier
than formerly. :

The details for such a plan must neces-
sarily be worked out after the army has
completed its statement of policy in re-
gards to college students as a whole and
the college authorities have determined
what adaptations they will make in classi -
fication of students.

An announcement was considered ad-
visable so that members of the lower
classes should be made v0 realize their

Success ...

The success of the newly inaugurated
physieal education program, we much
adinit. has come as something of a pleas-
ant Surprise to us.

Ulp+ihg observed both the students and
ie members of the athletie faculty only

Zo—thicing, peaee time, we were astonished

al the seriousness in the attitude of both.
. & +0 a letter to Mr. N. W.
hepacd. Athletic Director, from the
President of the National Collegiate
Aleve Association, Davidson very
adequately meecs the requirements for a
well rounded physical training program:

(1) It is compulsory( for all stu-
dents who are not physically disabled.

(2) it requires at least three periods
a eck of not Jess than one hour each.

(3) kr is designed to—develop en-
durance, agility, and courage. —

The letter quotes Rear Admiral Ran-
dall Jacobs, Chief of the Bureau of Naval
Personnel and Chairman of the Joint
Army-Navy Personnel Board as say-
ing: “It is hoped that men of the uni-
versities wilt institute among themselves
a regime of self discipline and conidi-
ioning in order better to complete the
immediate job at hand and prepare for
the greater tasks to come.

It is sincerely urged that the college
oftieiais and faculty members will sup-
port and pawicipate in all such pro--
grams.”

Neither the athletic staff, nor the.

ttdent body apparently -need such a
letter to stir them into increased, effort
with regard to the physical fitness pro-
gram, but it expresses, we think, the pur-
pose of ail in this connection as clearly -
and concisely 4s any we have seen.

The only danger which the local pro-
gram faces is the relapse it might pos-
sibly suffer when the novelty of the idea
wears off. The best feature about the
nian is its regularity, As Mr. Shepard
pointed out, the \actual time spent in

.2eise is hardly enough to really con-
dition the participants as things now
stand.

We cannot afford, therefore, to be-
come lazy. “Nor should we let the three

classes per week mark the limits of our_
physical endeavors. The intramural and
intercollegiate programs, are designed
to help us enjoy our conditioned phy-
siques, as well as to supplement the phys-
ical education scheme. Let us keep our.
awakened realization of the importance
of things physical. , ;

_ Campus Forum ._

Dear Ed,
Sometimes jit, becomes-_necessary

to remind the student body of cer-_

tdin rules and formalities that we
have to live by. It is just one of
these formalities that 1 am = writ-
ing you about, today. a

l- think that as long as we con-
sider ourselves apselect group di
students, and pr(te ourselves on
being Davidson ‘gentlemen, that
we should wake up and discover
just bow much harm we can do to
cach other by this silly gossip that
flies like the wind around, the
campus,

They say that “A woman's tongue
is worse than the sting of an ad-~
der". This may be true, but when
we: stop to think just how much
gossiping we do then 1 think —we
should be ashamed of ourselves. It
is our duty as upperclassmen to
instruct the freshmen, and to be
examples to them. Lf we candemn
them by spreading wild, untrue
rumors about them, then_we-are-not—

»gentiemen but instead are building

a bad reputation that will follow
them all through their college life.

There are, of course, many boys
on the campus who do have rather
distorted reputations. To these boys
it seems we take a delight in spread-
ing wild rumors. Why don't we
think that we are hurting them and
still not doing oursclves any good.

Let's be-grown-ups, and quit be,
ing children, or gdssiping old maids,
and try to live and let live. It’s too
easy to lie, so Iet's—be gure of a
thing before we spread .it, and be
constructive instead ‘of dustructive
in our criticism.

Sincerely,
A Student.
Dear Ed,

At the time of a recent visit to
the campus it was indeed gratifying
to see the American flag floating
atop the campus flag pole. There is
nothing particularly shocking about_
this observation to be sure, but
many. have been the times when
this flag pole stood for weeks at a
time without the Flag on its hal-
yard, ne

This fine old, emblem stands for
all those things that greater David-
son stands for. Davidson men have
and will die in defense of this fag
and all the principles that givé it.
universal respect.. Excepting the
Cross, no other inanimate object so
symbolizes the Christian way of life,
the democratic principle and the
optimistic viewpoint as does this
flag. Since the founding of the col-
lege, the basic.courses offered have
been these subjects or those closely

related to them, In these dark and.

ety

troublesome days Davidson must
remain steadfast in these teachings.

Pressing ever forward_under this
flag to gain the prize that is con- |

tained in these ideals, victory will
come to our arms and peace will
once again settle upon whatever
may be left of our physical and
worldly wealth. The youth of our

e nation can again. begin to plan for

a future. But all of their plans will
be in vain unless’ the plan includes
in’ part national and world-wide
measures that will insure its fulfill-
ment.

Will we this time be standing
united and ready with our. lamps fill-
ed and lighted when the opportn-
ity comes? Who among our number
will -be—the helmsman this time:
None, to be sure, unless we beyin
today lo shape up our program and
see to it that those in high places
know our will in this matter. ,

And what_of such a program 2—

Actually it can be so simple as. to

‘be complicated. In iliis asin every-

thing else that we undertake there
«are three very necessary’ and im-
portant clements. To”begin with
we must have the WILL to change
things and there must be embodied
in this willy a well devised and
thought out plan. Secondly, as a
people. and as a na#lion we must
seck and rely upon DIVINE guid-
Ace in the execution of and applica-
tion of the parts of the plan. These
Higst two elements will cost us noth-
ing—but some serious thought and
study. The third clement is the ex-
pensive one but an all important
part of the plan. ‘This is the CA-
PACITY ‘to make this plan work.
When World War IL is over this
nation will have the mightiest army
that man has yet dreamed of. It will
have been purchased and built from
to and sweat of millions of our

. Present citizens and the millions yet

to come._We must keep a large
part of-this force to insure the
proper functioning of our plan.
Truly, it looks as if opportunity
will again come to this nation in
the form of a challenge to take the
‘edad and supply the leadership. in
reshaping the’ world. What will our
answer be this time? If we fail to
heed this summons there is good
reason to feel that our nation will

not again be so favored. It is with—

nations the same as with individuals.

“He that shuns responsibility soon

finds that it is taken from him and

placed in the hands of others. God

forbid that we be found wanting

this time. .

Very truly yours,
William F. Gaifney, (30),
