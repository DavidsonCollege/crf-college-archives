‘Be Careful Out There

Davidson is a small college inan even smaller town. The students who
attend school here are, for the most part, affluent and insulated, —

We go to classes during the day, study some or work out at Baker
during the afternoon. Nights we study at the library or maybe watch a little
TV, go to the Union, gossip, you know. On weekends we go to the Court
to hang out and party. :

But it’s a big bad world out there and, sometimes, it can affect even us.

On Friday, two Davidson students were robbed at gunpoint by two
men who later murdered a police officer. They were not mugged ina back
alley, but in an area of Charlotte most of us would consider safe: in front
of a nice restaurant, in a well-lighted parking lot.

One of the suspects said later that he was surprised his gun-wielding
companion did not kill the two students. They were extremely lucky.

Davidson has an Honor Code which we all abide by. Ideally, students
do not cheat, steal, or lie. Unfortunately, the rest of the world doesn’t abide
by our code.

It was in no way the fault of the College or the students that this incident
took place. But it is important for all of us to remember (and at Davidson
it is often easy to forget) that we can all become victims.

Reynolds Price

The speech that Reynolds Price delivered at Fall Convocation was not
a “typical” convocation speech. :

He “‘splurged.” Price sat at the front of the stage, reciting poems,
mostly from memory, sharing with us his witand wisdom. Although there
were hundreds of people in the filled-to-capacity Love Auditorium, it felt
as if he were speaking to each of us personally.

Price held himself towards us, and asked “isn’t that what life is all
about?” hanes ;

We would like to thank Reynolds Price for his speech and his insight.

Committee Formed to
Address Alcohol Policy Concerns

To the Editor,

We are writing on be-
half of the SGA ad-hoc com-
mittee on the Alcohol Policy.
This committee was created
to consolidate students con-
cerns about the present alco-
hol policy, and to present a
cohesive report to Dean
Terry, The Counsel onCam-
pus and Religious Life and
the Trustees this Spring. We
believe that if we present
everyones’ views collec-
tively, as opposed to sepa-
rately, then change can oc-
cur. In order to accomplish
our task, the members of this

committee are accepting stu-
dents’ concerns about theal-
cohol policy.. We will keep
a running list of student in-
putabout the alcohol policy,
its enforcement, and its ef-
fects on the Davidson Col-
lege community.

Our efforts to bring
about change and improve-
ment must be representative
of the desires of the Davidson
student body in order to be
effective. Without student
input our efforts will be fu-
tile. Our committee mem-
bers are here to listen to your
ideas. Please contact us.

The Ad-Hoc Commit-
tee on the Alcohol Policy:
Eric Rosenbach
Jamal Jones
Mary Katherine Gregory
Mayur Patel
Karen Marshall
Lisa Sitek
Bobby Ramsay

SHOC

Begins Programs

To the Editor:
The Student Health Op-
tions and Concerns

(S.H.O.C.) Committee
kicked off the 1992-93
school year last Thursday,
with a Healthy Study Break
consisting of fruit, veg-
etables, cheese and crack-
ers, bagels, and low-fat Rice
Krispy Treats.

Since it was organized
inthe Spring of 1991,SHOC
has sponsored many health-

related activities such as
Condom Sense Week, Mas-
sage Study Break, and a Fat-
Free Study Break. In addi-

tion, SHOC helped sponsor —

Alcohol Awareness Weck,
and published a newsletter
called The Student Body to
promote awareness of eat-
ing disorders and sexually
transmitted diseases.
Alcohol & Drug aware-
ness, Sexual Health - which
includes the Davidson AIDS

project, eating disorders,
physical fitness & nutrition
and peer counselling are the
five subcommittees thatdeal
with specific health concerns
of SHOC.

Two of SHOC’s goals
for the 1992-93 school year
are coordinating the peer
counselling committee and
setting up a phone line so
that students can ask ques-

Alum Spreads His

Wisdom

To the Editor:

I’m getting a little up-
set. For most of my life, I
thought! had something ofa
lock on it, but, as I’ve re-
cently discovered, there ain’t
nobody can ownnothin’ any-
more. It’s gotten to the point
where a guy can’teven keep
a hold of his name.

Early in my otherwise
happy youth, I learned that I
wasn’t alone in the posses-
sion of my firstname. It was
bad enough that a good one

third of my preschool com-
panions would turn their tod-
dling heads whenever Mrs.
Connie at St. Francis of
Alacantra would alarmedly
bellow what! had thought to
be the term reserved tor me
alone, but my own grandfa-
ther seemed also to respond
whenever Mrs. Bannon, as
my grandmother preferred
to be called, would mutter
those syllables I hadclaimed
as my own.

As I grew older, I

learned that I shared my
names, my first and last
names, witha now infamous
sports personality. As the
freewheeling discussion of
athletic contests and their
perpetrators has always been
considered the most power-
ful bonding agent between
otherwise unfamiliar males,
many a man has attempted
to break the already thin ice
by pointing out the nominal

King Criticizes Sports

To the Editor, the Sports Edi-
tor, and the fictitious “Kent
Brockman”:

I am writing to express
my outrage concerning the
football article in the Sep-
tember 21 sports section of
the Davidsonian. 1 was
shocked to read the headline

which states “Rhodes Kicks

Grid ‘Cats Around Like an
Old Ragbucket, 31-6 De-
fense Allows Close to 500
Total Yards.” It is true that
the Davidson College Foot-
ball team was defeated by
Rhodes by the score of 31-6,
and that our defense did al-
‘low approximately 495
yards, but to include such a

negative, mean-spirited
headline in the newspaper is
appalling.

With sentences such as
“Rhodes’ domination of the
game was near total,” and
comparing the football team
to an “old ragbucket,” it is
