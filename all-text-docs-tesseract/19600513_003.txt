A LOOK AT....

SPORTS

<a | By Bill Godwin
|

Wildcat Ups and Downs...

We present in this final issue a capsule report on,
the fall, spring and winter sports.

Overall, it was a familiar story this year. The big
three — football, basketball and baseball suffered ion |
ribly at Davidson, while the minor sports in general and |
— swimming and golf in particular had outstanding |
seasons.

After 5 Years, A Calamity . . . |

Want of adequate scholarship aid has finally dropped!
the boom on the football team, aakd many. We're not |
sure. A squad which managed only one win in nine!
games aftér_five\straight years above the .500 mark had!
to have asons, however. Uppermost on the list|
were Charlié Benson's injuries. Coach Bill Dole put all|
his money on the senior quarterback —- he had to —|
and he lost.

. ‘This fall Dole will have more depth. If he can com-
bine Tee Redding and Duncan Morton and come up with
a healthy Benson, we'll be looking for an even break on
the schedule.

|

Finished High, Looking Higher . . .
|

_ An exciting soccer team ran over everybody but na-|
tionally ranked UNC and State. Hustle and hard play
produced seven wins for Coach Paul Marrotte’s crew.
Claude Finney, All-Southern goalie last year, will be cap-
tain of this fall’s team, which should show even better. |

_Fete Whittle’s harriers were 7-2 on the season.
Senior Bill Eckbert, who placed third in the loop meet,
and David Gilmour made All-Conference. Gilmour will
be back as a junior this fall with Bob Thompson and an
array of sophomores and juniors.

Danger—Don’‘t Look Back...

The Wildcat cagers have everything to gain and|
nothing to lose this winter. With a new coach, Charles
(Lefty) Driesell, and a couple of new varsity faces, David-
son will be trying hard to forget a dismal 5-19 season.
The material was there, but just didn’t click. Eddie
Stewart and John Huie are graduating, but returning
will be Joe Markee, Bill Shinn, Jim Nuckolls, Jerry Bus-
sell, Tom Harris, Allen Millar, D. G. Martin and Bob
Moore. A couple of rising sophomores, Bill Jarman
and Haywood Evans, should see a lot of action.

Catfish Couldn’t Quit... .

_ The Davidson swimming team has to be rated the best ever.
First-year coach Dwight Shoe saw his tankers break or tie every
school record and romp to a second-place finish in the Southern
Conference meet. Seniors John Scott, Bill Hellier and Smitty
Smith were the sparkplugs of an 8-2 season. A perfect record
may be in store for this winter. Heading returnees are Tom
Hudgins, Barry Branch, Jack Rose, George Gabel and Stefan
Young, who topped the conference in the breaststroke.

Coach Charlie Parker's grapplers had to settle for a 2-5-1
season’s record and a fifth-place’ finish in the loop tourney.
Leading wrestlers were seniors Milton Gee and Alex Porter,
sophomore Jim Alexander and junior Cliff Thompson.

It'll be a rough climb this season.

The ROTC riflers fell to sixth place in the conference
tournament. Senior Joe Wearn was high man all season long.
Sgt. James McCurry expects a better-balanced team ‘next year.

Pitching, Fielding Hurt ‘Cats . . .

With two single games left to go against The Citadel, David-
son had dropped 11 of 17. The big bats of Tom Harris, Ed
Hines, Russ Cotton and Harry Cline held 4 most of the season,
but afield the Wildcats were spotty and the pitching staff, led
by senior Dee Green, was not dependable, Prospects for 1961
will hinge on pitching quality. Some help for Coach Tom Stev-
ens’ crew will come from the freshman squad.

Whittle’s trackmen went into the Southern Conference meet
today with a 5-2 record. Losses to powerhouses Furman and
VPI were by narrow margins. Pole vaulter John Huie and jave-
lin thrower Stuart Nickles set records this year and will grad-
uate along with two-miler Bill Eckbert. But the Wildcats should
remain strong in 1961 with. Ed Kizer, David Gilmour, Mike
Laughlin, Hugh Murray, Bob Thompson, Roger Beebe, Pat Currie,
Bill Coffey and others.

The Tourney Was Worth It All...

Coach Tom Scott's golfers wound up the season with a bet-!
ter-than-average 9-8 record, but their conference tournament vic-
tory was the prize. Junior Verner Stanley was medalist. All
other team members — Tom Johnson, Eb LeMaster, Curley Mac-
Queen, Sut Alexander, Bob Avinger and Claude Finney —. will
graduate. Scott will fill up the team with freshmen.

Davidson's netters, Having under first-year coach Ted Keesl-
er, compiled a 5-9 record and placed third in the loop tourna-
ment. No. 6 man Jim Hamilton was the lone finals winner.

This afternoon the Davidson College track team took ‘the field for their final

outing of t
burg, Va.

Says Coach Whittle, “It is al-
most a certainty that The Cit-
adel will walk away with the
championship, with Furman,
V. M. L, and William and Mary |
finishing behind them in that |
order.”

ONE BY ONE |

But the Wildcat team is cap- |
able of fine performances on
an individual level in many of
the events.

Davidson’s squad for this|
meet numbers eleven men. Of;
these, five are taking the field
for the last time for the Wild- |
cat team:

RECORD HOLDERS

Captain Stuart Nickles, who |
holds the school record of 196
feet 1% inches in his event,
will throw the javlin. }

Co-captain John Huie will |
high jump and pole vault for
the Wildcats — his height of
12 feet 6 inches is a school rec-
ord in the pole vault.

Senior Chet Alexander will
run the 440, and seniors Bill
Eckbert and Larry McNeill will
run the two-mile.

HOP-STEP-JUMPER

Other tracksters who are com-
peting in this meet are Andy
Boggs in the discus and hop-
| step-jump; Ed Kizer in the 100
jand 220 yard dashes; and Rog-
er Beebe in the 440.

John Chiles will broad jump
and enter the hop-step-jump.
Rounding out the team will be
Harirs and Bob Thompson in
the 880.

Hugh Murray. and Mike
Laughlin will compete in both
the broad jump and hop-step-
jump at the meet in Williams-;
burg.

Seniors on the Davidson
squad who did not make the
trip to Williamsburg include in-
jured Brownie Thurman and
Dave Warden.

FIVE-TWO RECORD |

This meet marks the comple-|
tion of a very succesful season |
for the Wildcat thinclads. Un-
der the direction of Pete Whit-
tle the ‘Cats compiled a record}
of five wins against only two}
defeats in dual meet competi-'
tion. :

In a season which saw five|
school records fall, the David-|
son team successfully defended |
their crown at the High Point |
relays held on April 30. This |
— renamed as the Davidson-,
High Point relays — is to be-|
come an annual meet. |

The season aiso marked a
sharp rise of student interest in|
track fortunes. i

year. He is a senior.

“Hambone” made his first trip
to the Southern Conference this
year, playing in the sixth sing-

George . Washington’s Larry
Church in the finals, 6-3 and 6-4.

“I just knocked them (the

In conference competition,

Andy Sherrill was dropped by

Meanwhile Jim Hamilton, who

The Davidson College tennis team, under the direction of Coach Ted Keesler,
finished up their season last weekend at Washington, D. C., by finishing third in
The ’Cats grabbed 11 points in the tourna-
ment behind first place George Washington, who bagged 22 points, and second-place
Citadel with 20. Fourth place went to William and Mary, who managed 6 points.

RUGGED SCHEDULE

But a good won-lost record
was impossible due to the rug-
ged schedule, which included
such teats as nationaly ranked
Miami and North Carolina; At-
lantic Coast stronghorses Wake
Forest, Duke, and N, C. State;
always tough Presbyterian; plus
conference opposition.

Playing their final season for
Davidson were seniors Harry
Broome, Jim Hamilton, and
Bob Huffaker. Huffaker played
in about half the matches, but
was greatly handicapped by his
many afternoon labs.

Looking back over the season,
Hamilton stated, “Coach Kees-
ler deserves a lot of eredit. He
held fall practice to get us in
shape, and then got us a tough
schedule, which gave us some
invaluable experience.”

FIVE RETURN

Next year, five lettermen
(Orr, Lee, Sherrill, Young, and
Snead) will return to the courts
for Davidson. In addition to
these, the freshman team, led
by Bobby Austell, may provide
a lot of help

With this nucleus of tennis
players, the outlook is bright
for the 'Cats.
