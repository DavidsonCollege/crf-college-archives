A Mouthful Of New Ideas

The cafeteria service is to be commended for_ the
changes which have been instituted. Ron Scott and Keith
Carson have inaugurated several new ideas which satisfy
several student complaints of the past.

The Sunday buffet has been well received. The a la
carte line for lunch has been appreciated, particularly for
those who do not hold a meal ticket.

The display of food is much more appealing than in
the past where the boiled eggs were the only attempt at
creativity. In addition Carson and Scott have shown a re-
ceptiveness to student complaints and suggestions that
has never been a characteristic of the ARA Slater Cor-
poration in our years at Davidson.

One important issue which has not been handled to
the satisfaction of many students, however, is the restric-
tions placed on meal ticket holders.

As in the past the college has required all freshmen
to purchase meal tickets. As in the past, to buy a meal
ticket one has had to pay for all 20 meals a week, includ-
ing many breakfasts he never sees. In addition to the break-
fasts, many freshmen and upperclassmen who hold meal
tickets miss meals when they are off campus for weekends.

. If a person has paid for all of the meals which are
served during the week. he should have the right to al-
low those meals to be eaten, either by himself or by some-
one to whom he has given his ticket. We can see no other
reason for making the ticket non-transferable other than
the fact that the cafeteria can thus avoid preparing as
many meals as have been purchased.

An Annual Problem

Respect, of sorts, is due our counterpart over on the
staff of the Quips & Cranks, the student yearbook. Ronnie
Conoley, the editor of the annual, has demonstrated that.
if nothing else, he does have guts, however mindless such
a trait may be.

Conoley’s refusal to accept the polled opinion of the
student body and the legislative actions of the students’ sen-
ate has become a ridiculous mania, and this irrational stub-
borness will serve only to make ludricrous an already piti-
able situation for both the vearbook and its editor.

By asking the Activities Fee Committee to approve
a budget of $10,500 for the yearbook, Conoley has not only
ignored a senate decision of last spring limiting yearbook
funds to $8,000, but has also caused a rift of sort on the
committee itself.

The three non-student members of the committee, in-
cluding Professor of Mathematics Richard Bernard, — Di-
rector of the College Union C. Shaw Smith, and Business
Manager Robert Currie, are painfully sensitive to their
position, and according to some reports have openly ex-
pressed their distaste for being under student control
and have questioned the role of the committee. _

__Conoley’s request for $2,500 more than the senate is
willing to give has caused a festering wound to become
more inflamed, for at least two of the non-student mem-
bers of the committee (Smith and Currie) have indicated
they would like to buck the senate and appropriate the
extra funds to the yearbook.

To do so, however, would not only be a direct affront
to the constitution, but would also set a dangerous pre-
cedent of ealculated disobedience before other senate
committees and subcommittees.

Furthermore, it is questionable whether the Quips

& Cranks deserve more than $8,000 originally appropiat-
ed. Conoley was quite definitely informed last spring that
his budget would be $8,000, yet he has stated that all his
planning since that time has been built on the assumption
that he will have $10,500 with which to work. Gutsy, per-
haps, but certainly no sign of intelligent, responsibilile
—P or realistic recognition of the financially inevit-
able.
_ _ Also, the student body in a poll conducted last spring
indicated by a substantial majority that it favored a de-
finite reduction in yearbook funds. Last year, Quips &
Cranks got approximately $11,000.

Finally, there looms large the question of the worth
of the college annual. No one is pleased that last year’s
copy is still not with us this. year, and several senators
and other vocal students have already expressed doubts
as to whether the yearbook product is worth even $8,000
of student money.

Quips & Cranks certainly does hove a place at David-
son, but not at some outrageous cost. We urge Conoley
to quit his fruitless fray, come back to the realties of the
situation and begin working on an $8,000 annual. For if
indeed the yearbook does deserve the funds he requests,
or even those he’s been given, then: it should demonstrate
its worth.

After all, the proof is in the pudding.

The American Army Plays
Fun And Games On Campus

Davidson's worst tradition in
the 1970's is that it continues to
support institutions which make
wars happen.

The most repulsive thing this
college does is to allow the
American Army to maintain its
R.O.T.C. program here. And
there seems to be little interest
on the part of administrators to
get rid of it.

The R.O.T.C. program at
Davidson is very expensive.
There are many employees on
the R.O.T.C. department, the
cost of equipment such as uni-
forms and guns is high, and
each year the R.O.T.C. lures
students to it by buying their
souls for $50 per month while
here.

Maintenance of the program
also requires that the entire
basement of Belk be used and
that R.O.T.C. staff be given a
tot of good parking spaces which
are badly needed.

R.O.T.C. staff members re-
mind me of little kids who were
conditioned to run around play-
ing soldier and war and who
never grew up. They run out to
the playing fields on Tuesdays
during the fall and spring terms
(Not during the winter, how-
ever—I guess they're not ex-
pecting to have a war in the
winter) and click their rifles
around and march and throw
grenades.

A couple of times a year they
simulate war games out in the
woods just as though they were
in Vietnam getting ready to
gun down some ‘‘gooks."’ This
is the most infantile and insen-
sitive activity I see here. It is
infantile and = moronic’ and
stupid.

Students who still join R.O.
T.C. certainly don’t think very
much. Many of them join be-
cause their father joined and
their grandfather before him
was an officer.

They make no real attempt
to understand their own feel-
ings. to formulate their own
opinions, and to act for them-
selves. In this sense, R.O.T.C.
prolongs the childhood and ad-
olescence of Davidson students
and does not allow them to
grow at all.

The R.O.T.C. staff, with their
crude jokes try to make every-
one think that it’s all just a
big game that’s necessary. But
the problems’ is that these flat-
heads don't know the difference
between what is a game and
what is a very serious matter.

We also have some student
flatheads in the local chapter
of the Young Americans for
Freedom (which was organiz-
ed by a student who is an arch-
conservative Catholic honky),
who are so out of touch with
the 1970's that I doubt that
they'll ever grow up.

The YAF will probably kill
each other off in their conser-
vative greed and_ psychotic
manner. They are just as_ in-
sensitive as the worst Army of-
ficers.

There are lots of little things,
too, which Davidson does which
shows where its institutional
values lies. Last month, David-
son brought two very out-of-
touch men to campus of: give

them honorary degrees at Con-
vocation, and in describing why
Davidson chose to honor these
men, Dr. Spencer read little
statements praising their mili-
tary records. This contunies to
support the ridiculous notion
that every Davidson degree
holder is to be a gentleman
and an officer.

Many of the trustees (though
not all of them, fortunately) are
old military men who merely
moved their conservatism from
the battlefield to the pulpit and
became ministers after leaving
the Army.

I have reported before that
one of them thinks I am a
Communist (which is really
short-sighted) and another has
told me that Davidson should
have everyone in compulsory
R.O.T.C. because for him that
was the best thing he did here
at Davidson and every David-
son student must be proud
enough to fight for his country.
I really feel sorry for him that
he could find nothing more
meaningful here than that.

If you really want a picture
of why I say all this, listen to
the following.

There is a young man who
we know, 22 years old, on the
threshold of his life just begin-
ning to see where’s he going.
But today, he ties wounded in
a small hamlet outside Saigon.
He lies twitching and writhing
in pain.

A series of bullets has rid-
dled his body. He has vomited
and coughed up blood and his
stomach, because of a serious
wound there, is oozing blood
and bits of flesh and parts of
his insides.

He looks before him and his
eyes blur and he can't remem-
ber what hit him and he can't
feel anymore, and then he be-
comes unconscious and he can's
see. He slumps and falls and
is dead and although we knew
him before as a friend, we can-
not see him now except in the
blood in which he sits.

Another man comes to him,
counts him on the list which is
sent to headquarters, and head-
quarters changes the numbers
so it won't look so bad.

On the other side of the lines,
Dok-Lo looks at the rice field
she worked as a child with her
father and mother. It is the
rice field from which she got
the rice which fed her as a
child and which, until last year,
continued to feed her.

She looks over the field now,
stagnant with the pollution of
hundred’ different chemicals
cropped by American bombs to
defoliate the jungle nearby, and
she soon knows that her field
can never grow anything again.

Dok-Lo knows her friends are
dead, and the tears from her
eyes reflect all the sadness and
the misery and grief that only
she can know.

Dok-Lo has friends who are
dead and our friend is now
dead too. Davidson support
ed the cause for this death and
destruction.

Davidson supported the notion
that being a soldier and a killer
is admirable. Davidson  sup-
ported too damn much of the
deplorable mess we are in.

Now it is time to mend our
ways. R.O.T.C., and all that
it represents, must go. Even
to have it here one more year
is intolerable.

Fiscal Policy Tied
ToReform Needs

By JOHN A. CROWL

.Chronicle of Higher Education

The relationship — or lack of
it— between higher education's
financial troubles and the need
for reform in colleges is a ma-
jor topic of debate in academic
circles this fall.

Virtually all of the Associa-
tion of Governing Boards of
Universities and Colleges spoke
of links between fiscal policy
and academic reform, although
the meeting was supposed to
concentrate .on ‘‘money”™ and
management.”

“The problems are interrelat-
ed, intertwined, and not really
separable,’ said Matthew J.
Cullen Jr., an education con-
sultant who is a visiting fellow
at the Battelle Memorial In-
stitute.

“‘One appears to be more ur-
gent—the financial,” he said,
‘while the other appears to he
more important—the education-
al." He continued:

Unless our institutions become
more flexible, more adaptive
more sensitive to the future di-
rection and to the learning re-
quirements of the emerging so-
ciety, they will not survive.”

In questioning the advisably

of a proposed program of fed-
eral grants’ to _ institutions.
James B. Cardwell, . Assistant
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, repeated an argu-
ment that has been voiced by
other members of the Nixon
Administration.

. He asked, ‘‘As difficult as the
stress are on the system (of
higher education) and its fin
ancing, might not the stresses
themselves lead to reforms and
efficiencies to the ultimate good
of education? By turning to
what may prove only to be an
expedient, are we taking the
pressure off and thus making
it more difficult for those who
would improve and reform and
easier for those who, for what
ever reason, would preserve the
status quo?”

Earl F. Cheit, professor of
business administration at the
University of California at
Berkeley, looked at the pro-
blem from a different angle.

Cheit, author of The New De-
presion in Higher Education
hased on a study he conducted
for the Carnegie Commission on
Higher Education, said: ‘‘There
must be a commitment for ad-
ditional investment in higher
education.”’
