at Martin's inauguration as the college's
13th president on April 22, 1959:

‘‘He is not a minister. but he has
Christian faith and concern. He is not an
educator, but is a man who has high
educational standards."’

At 48, he was Davidson’s youngest
president in its history. Although he was
awarded six honorary degrees, including
one from Davidson, his only earned
degree was a Bachelor of Science (with
honors) from Davidson.

Martin was one of four boys who grew
up on a farm one mile from Covington,
Ga. Despite the fact that some of his
relatives had been college ad-
ministrators, he originally wanted to
become a missi .

While at Davidson he played varsity
basketball with former Secretary of State
Dean Rusk and Professor of History
Frontis W. Johnston.

Interviewed by phone at his University
of Georgia Law School office. Rusk said.
‘We didn’t play what you would call big
league basketball. and we had our share
of wins and losses. However. I do recall
our beating Duke and Carolina.

‘‘And we did learn how to lose in those
days. I think this was called ‘charac-
ter building’ .”’

After 15 months of graduate study at
Emory University, he returned to David-

relations director from 1933 to 1936. Then
followed four years with a coal company

Bristol, Va., where he remained until
1951, when he took a substantial salary
