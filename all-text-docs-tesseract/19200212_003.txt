delightful afternoon motoring to

Cartwile, this insults the astron-
omical world: “Galileo was the
first man to see the rings of Saturn;
he was in all respects a great astron-

omer; but he would have been much.

greater but for the fact that he had
only one eye and that was glass.”

saldwin sat dowii in qne of
Haney’s chairs which contained a
prominent tack. Asked if he tore
his trousers,. Baldwin remarked:
“No. but I pulled.out the tack.”

_ This time of year we spend more
time chasing raincoats than rain-
bows.

It may not be so bad for students
to forget to put on their leggins in
the morning but some day someone
is going to leave off some more
responsible part of their costume

.and ‘ev ah’ regret it. ,

Employ “As Ever" only with -

time to write or J don't.
