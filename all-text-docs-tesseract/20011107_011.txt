A rocky season came to a close for
women’s field hockey last weekend, as the
Wildcats traveled to Boone, NC, for the
NorPac Conference Tournament. As has
been the trend all year, Davidson suffered
narrow losses and overtime defeats, de-
spite outstanding play and stiff competi-
tion.

The Wildcats’ first game pitted them
against No. 17 University of California,
the number one seed of the tournament.
California scored twice in the first half,
putting Davidson behind by two at the
break. The game was just beginning, how-
ever, and the second half was a scoring fest
for both teams.

Less than a minute and a half into the
second period, Davidson’s Amanda
Strickland attacked with Davidson’s first
goal of the match. One minute later,
Kathleen Fenn scored again for the ’Cats
off an assist from Alex Rogers, tying the
game at 2.

California scored two more goals, but
Davidson kept fighting back. Strickland
continued her offensive attack and found
the back of the net two more times with
assists from Liz Schoening.

The score remained even at the end of
regulation play.

It was not until the second overtime

Bitter end for fi

period that California’s Sarah Hunt scored,
handing Davidson the narrow 4-5 loss.

“We gave Cal their best competition of
the tournament,” said sophomore Zoe’
Segnitz. “Our game against them was
viewed fairly unanimously as the highest
skill seen all weekend. Their win over us
was lucky—they recognize this as much as
we do.”

The ’Cats then faced host school Appala-
chian State University for their second game
of the weekend. ASU scored less than a
minute into the game, and added a second
goal later in the half to increase their lead to
two.

Davidson scored late in the second half
with a goal from Fenn, assisted by Rogers. -
But with less than two minutes of play left, it
wasn’t enough for the win.

Freshman goalie Cate Schenning played
both games for the Wildcats, tallying 6 goals
against California and 4 against ASU.

Davidson is ending the season with a 5-14
record in head coach Christy Morgan’s first
season as a Wildcat.

The young team is looking forward to
progress next year, having gained strength
from the past season. “This year has been
one of a lot of growth not only as players
but as individuals,” said senior goalkeeper
Manda Mordavsky. These women are
amazing people, and I will miss them
greatly next year.”

Cats face Spartans to open
SoCon women’s soccer action

Cross-state foes UNC-Greensboro and
UNC-Wilmington both defeated the Wild-
cats handily in soccer contests last week.

The Wildcats’
offense played
like ghosts in the
Halloween night
3-0 loss to the
Spartans of
Greensboro. The
Cats | were
doubled up in shot
totals, 18-9.

For the Spar-
tans, Kate Dylag
scored two and
Katherine
Trevillian added
one to put the
game out of reach for Davidson by the
57:39 mark.

Head Coach Kevin Hundley commented
on the ghost-like offense, saying, “I felt
that the final score demonstrated that
Greensboro finished their scoring chances
better than we did, but not that they neces-
sarily outplayed us by three goals.”

The loss was especially trying due to its
importance as a conference game so close
to the end of the season.

The silver lining in this game’s dark
cloud was the return of the starting goal-

keeper Sarah Hobart. She recorded 10 saves

inthe game, firmly planting her on the road

to recovery.

In another frustrating loss on Saturday,
the ’Cats paced the Seahawks of UNC-
Wilmington for most of their game, only to
fall
Seahawk
came five minutes
into the second
half. Hobart
notched six saves
on the evening.

Seniors Natalie
Cox, Penn Graves,
and Carolyn
Stumpf finished
out their Davidson
home. games with
the loss, and the
*Cats drop to a 7-
13 season record.

The Southern Conference Champion-
ship kicks off this weekend at Furman
University in Greenville, S.C. The ’Cats
enter the tournament with a 6-4 conference
record, backed by their inspirational four-
game win streak earlier in the season.

The sixth-seeded ’Cats will first face the
third-seeded UNCG Spartans after a 10-
day break from one another. The Spartans
captured last year’s conference title with a
1-0 victory over the Furman Paladins. The
game is slated for 7:30 p.m. on Friday,
Nov. 9.

like we had more and better scoring opportu-
nities,” commented Spear after the game.
“Giving up a penalty kick at home for the
game’s lone goal is a tough way to lose. As
I had expected, our team’s confidence and
ability to create dangerous chances increased
as the game progressed to the point where we
had plenty of chances to claim the win. But
it all comes down to putting the ball in the
back of the net and, to Furman’s credit, they

got the goal they needed.”

- “We would love to play them again in the
tournament,” Spear noted.. “But we have
plenty of work between now and then, start-
ing with our final home game on Wednesday
against Wofford. We would love a big crowd
to help push us through.”

Following the Wofford game, the Wildcat
regular season will come to an end on Satur-
day as the ’Cats travel to Georgia Southern
for another SoCon showdown.
