Wildcat Miracle

It is not general policy for the edi-
torial page to take note of the athletic
fortunes, that is except in case of
fights or .. miracles.

This week we do have a full-fledged
miracle on our hands—a miracle of
spirit and effort which spelled a last
second, one point. story book, hysteri-
cal win for the Wildcats over an ex-
cellent Wofford football team.

When Bruce Usher's kick drop-
ped through the uprights. pandemoni-
um broke out in the Davidson stands.
“Gentlemen” kissed dates. Dean Fron-

tis Johnston dropped his pipe; never
had. there been such a moment. It

was a thrilling victory

_ However, the real thrill did not
come from the one point margin. but
from the privilege of watching a coach
and team that refused to quit.

And herein lies our point. Years
from now the score will be forgotten
by most, but the spectacle of sheer
“instestinal fortitude” will be remem-
bered by all who were. there.

The DAVIDSONIAN congratulates
coach Dole, Captain Craig Wall. hero
Bruce Usher, and the entire Wildcat
team for an amazing display of deter-
mination.

Needed Change:
Unlimited Cuts

It is part of the pedagogical theory
of certain Davidson professors that a
student who is not physically present
in the classroom (whether awake or
not) virtually every day of the semes-
ter should receive no credit for a
course, no matter how much he knows
or how well he does on reviews and
exams. This view (certainly held by
a sizeable: minority on the faculty),
along with the resistance to change
possessed by a long-standing tra-
dition, is probably the main obstacle
in the path of a much-needed aca-
demic improvement: the unlimited cut
system.

A number of the: better colleges
and universities in the United States
now have this form of attendance
regulation, and a similar method has
been used by European universities
for centuries. To institute. unlimited
cuts would be an important step in
Davidson's progress away from ‘pa-
ternalism and toward a strengthened
educational policy.

Unlimited cuts would free stu-
dents from attending courses in which
the lectures are at best duplications
of textbook material and at worst
completely irrelevant to the subject ‘
matter. Such a system would also
stimulate professors whose classroom
performance is slack to improve the
quality and increase the importance
of the material they present, or be
deserted en masse by the students en-
rolled in their courses.

Furthermore, a change of this sort
would increase the intellectual ma-
turity of the student body (at least
among those who want to avoid flunk-
ing out of school). To know that they
are on their own in a course—that
the spoon-feeding has ended — would
be an invaluable means of inducing
the self-discipline essential to a com-
plete liberal education.

A sweeping change of this sort
would be begun slowly, of course, and
on an experimental basis. It might
prove advisable to require class atten-
dance of freshmen, in a manner

some form of compulsory attendance
might be necessary for. students with
.dangerously low grades. Such modi-
fications’ could be worked out on a
trial-and-error basis within an over-
all unlimited cut framework.

The DAVIDSONIAN feels. how-
ever, that this change is a desirable
one, which should be introduced at
the earliest feasible time: such as next
semester.—C.H.C.

Note:

Dr. Donald Russell’s visit to the
campus Tuesday must be marked as
one of Davidson's privileges that

come all too far apart.

During his stay. Dr. Russell dis-
played, in a modest manner, his wide
knowledge of the intricacies involved
in the operation of a college or uni-
versity

He is a man of progressive ideas

and genuine enthusiasm. Coupling

these traits with his wide background,
experience and contacts,: we can
scarcely think of a man better quali-
fied to serve as a university president.

In recent weeks, ‘The Carolina
Gamecock”, fine student publication
of the University of South Carolina,
has supported a movement to ask Dr.
Russell to beeome again the Presi-
dent of that institution.

The DAVIDSONIAN would like to
support the “Gamecock” .on this is-
sue, and to add that South Carolina
could not hope to find a more quali-
fied President than Donald Russell.

Fraternity Court
Lights Necessary

Often we read on these pages how
we might improve Davidson by
changes of an intangible nature. Then
we read how much improvement the
college is making as a physical plant.
But let us look briefly at some areas
of needed improvement of a physical
nature.

With the coming of the winter
months. the jaunt down to fraternity
court for supper and the return to
the dorms is being made in increas-
ingly descending darkness.

It therefore seems a reasonable
request to make of the powers that
be to furnish lights for the’ court.
The jungle of darkness around the
court at night is penetrated periodical-

ly by only the light from a fraterni-
ty house porch or living room—all too

little to suffice.

Along the same Tine, more light
along dormitory row is needed. For
quite awhile the stretch between the
gym and the Guest House has been
very much in need of more light.

Back at the fraternity court, we
find ourselves still plodding across
boardwalks to the house entrances.
With the houses now fully completed
almost a month (even the grass is
beckoning a lawnmower), we need
walkways to add the last touch to the
physical appearance of the court.

... and then, no one seems to have
heeded the suggestion made by Edi-
tor Emeritus of this paper to remedy
the situation of puddles on the cam-
pus walks following a rain fall. The
little lakes continue to spring forth
in the most inconvenient places.

AN OLD ARGUMENT

Judge Nix, Freshman Air Views
Concerning Court Of Control Value | [; Man Of Letters cm

John Nix

What merit is there in the
Court .of Control at Davidson
College? This question has
been asked often during the
past two months by students
who seem concerned about a
tradition that has been a part of
this campus for thirty five
years.

It is my feeling that the Court
of Control, with aims as stated
in Davidson’s Constitution, is
important to a Freshman class.
The article which gives the
Court its authority reads as fol-
lows——“It shall be the duty of
the Court te hear, investigate
and deal with the charges of
upperclassmen against Fresh-
men of improper conduct, vio-
lating Freshman regulations, or
breaking college traditions.”
The section is explicit concern-
ing the duties of the Court. How
the duties are to be carried out
is left almost entirely up to
the Judge.

Why is this section included?
lL believe it is because of a fact
that shows itself every year
when certain members of the
Freshman class come to David-
son: some are not able to real-
ize that they are Freshmen.
In order to make this segment
of the class aware that its con-
duct and attitude is unaccept-
able, the Court is needed.

CLASS SPIRIT

A second function of the
Court is to develop class spirit
by presenting something .con-
rete: the Freshman regulations
which the entire class must ob-
serve. The purpose of wearing
name tags is seldom questioned:
the value of the regulation con-
cerning speaking to persons on
the campus seems evident to
all.

The question of caps may be
best explained. in that it is a
sign of identification. A regula-
tion such as not walking on the
grass should make the Fresh-
man realize he is not quite
the big college man he may

Spirit of ’62

think he is after being at David-
son a few days.

HUMILITY

The purpose of those who
drew up the Freshman regula-
tions was to require of fresh-
men a reasonable amount of
humility. It may be that the pre-
vailing attitude has changed
since our regulations were
drawn up. Perhaps the thought
is no longer one of Freshman
humility, but ratker one of in-
tegrating the Freshman class in-
to the student body as quickly
as possible. If this is the pres-
ent viewpoint, then much of
what the Court is instructed to
do must be changed.

I feel there is a definite need
for the Court of Control on Da-
vidson’s campus. The aims of
the Court, as I interpret them,
have value to individuals in the
Freshman class and to the
Freshman class as a whole.

In order for the Court to sur-
vive it must have support and
respect from the upperelass-
men; when this is gained, such
respect will be instilled in the
minds of the Freshman.

Bill Workman

Actually, one could hardly
criticize the Court of Control
itself. because its function is
merely to “hear. investigate,
and deal with the charges of
the upperclassmen against
freshmen of improper conduct.
violation of freshman regula-
tions. or breaking college tra-
ditions.” Obviously, the only way
the Court could fall down on
its constitutional job would be
for it to do a slip-shod job of
investigation and punishment—
which, I assure you, they don’t.

NOT ALL CONSTRUCTIVE

However, one may very well
criticize the concept of improp-
er conduct of freshmen, as it
exists at Davidson today. Our
Constitution forbids any form
of hazing; therefore, in order
to be “legal” all freshmen regu-

e e . o

LETTER TO EDITOR

lations must be constructive in
nature. The regulations such as
wearing name tags and speak-
ing to those met on campus are
clearly constructive. There are

others, however, such as wear-'

ing hats not walking on the
grass, and being “respectful”
(more nearly obsequious) to up-
perclassmen, about which 1
have my doubts.

It seems to me that anything
wrong for one man is wrong
for another. insofar as it af-
fects large groups of people.
lf it is wrong for a freshman to
walk on the grass, it is equal-
ly wrong for an upperclassman
to do so. We are told, however.
that these are not cases of right
or wrong, but mercly rules set
up to help us gain a sense of
class unity and spirit.

FRESHMAN ACTION
It is pretty clear, however,
that the way these rules are to
aid us in this end is to push
to the point where we break
them as a body. Hardly con-
structive. As a matter of fact,

‘the most constructive action

I've seen taken towards devel-
oping class unity came through
the Freshman Council some
weeks ago when Bob Stone
asked the class to refrain from
following the example of the
upperclassmen in hissing chapel
speakers.

We could have a set of con-
structive freshman regulations;
rules which the class could obey
as a body and still feel like
college men. I have an_ idea.
however. that we will never
have such a set of regulations.
It would involve too great a
change in the basie attitudes
of too many people. I think it’s
fairly easy for a man to hiss a
chapel speaker and then tell a
freshman to get off the grass.
But I have an idea that very
few Davidson men could do this
and then reprimand the frosh
for. disrespect for Davidson
ideals of character.

Writer Slams “Spirit” Article

Dear Editor:

In his sports column last
week, Mr. Hamilton criticized
the Student Body for showing
too little spirit at football
games. His comments have
raised several questions in my
mind, and I should appreciate
it if he or someone else can
answer them,

CHEERING ONLY OUTLET

First, why is it that cheer-
ing at football games is the
primary acceptable outlet for
showing school spirit? Why
should such activities as work
in any of the various campus
organizations, or Union ‘com-

PEANUTS

mittee work, or scholastic work
beyond the requirements be
less laudable ways of showing
spirit?

Secondly, why should cheer-
ing be insisted upon whether
or not any other ways of show-
ing spirit are utilized? Does a
lethargic student who goes to
the games and cheers loudly
show more spirit than an active
student who does not?

HYPOCRITICAL

Thirdly, isn’t cheering often
hypocritical? How great is the
school spirit of a student who
cheers the team on Saturday
but makes sarcastic remarks

I THINK I COULD BE HAPPY
IF_ MY LIFE HAD MORE
PURPOSE TO IT...

about the rest of the College
all week long?

And fourthly, should those
people who do not especially
like to watch football attend
the games anyway in order to
show school spirit? And if so,
to whom should they be show-
ing this spirit?

I am not opposed to cheering
the football team, but I do ob-
ject strongly to the accusation
that those people necessarily
lack school. spirit who some-
times do not go to the games
and who do not cheer loudly
when they do go.

: ~e

By JOHN TOUMARAS

It is inconceiveable that any studeut would vote
against the proposed constitutional amendment establish-
ing the Honor Council. No doubt there are questions con-
cerning the Honor Council which will have to be settled.
This can be done after the initial amendment has been
passed and after the Council has been put into operation.
An important question is that of trial. procedure, Is the
Honor Council to use the procedure as defined by the
Student Body Constitution at the moment or is it to be
allowed to evolve its own procedure? Perhaps is can be-
gin its operations by relying upon the present procedure,
but an amendment should be passed allowing it to estab-
lish its own procedure as it sees fit.

There would probably be some opposition to this
as some may say that it places too much power in the
hands of the Honor Council. Not at all. The student body
maintains the right to repeal any and all constitutional
amendments as it sees fit. This should never be forgot-
ten. The Tonor Council is definitely a step forward and
should be taken without hesitation.

This column has been informed that 0.D.K. proposes
to make a study of the whole question of the Court of
Control. Perhaps they can come us with some feasible
plan of effective control. As the Court of Control exists
at the moment, it should be abolished. It commands little
if no respect and has no real sanction of its own. Either
make it strong or leave the task of indoctrinating the
freshmen to the rigors and traditions of Davidson to the

various fraternities.

The following poems were written by ‘an alum-
nus who finally gave up and transferred to Wake

Forest his sophomore year. They were first published
in Wake Forest’s THE STUDENT under the title “Bed-
lam Bull”. In Sam Maury, Davidson may have fost

a man of letters.

You are there at home

And I am here in a motel room
And wishing that I could love

Stil get drunk.
Soon school and friends
And foolish activities
And cold nights in warm beds
And cold books in warm hands
Soon these and autumn
Will enfold us all
And we will not have time
For such things as this
I wish I could

THE PHILOSOPHES

Court Might

Amidst the recent discussion
of the Honer Court proposal
there has arisen the critical ob-
servation that the new system
would leave the Student Coun-
cil virtually devoid of function.
if not of responsibility.

The comment is valid if
directed toward the de
liberations of the present
Council and its ignoring of
this potential effect of the
program it proposes: as di-
rected against the system
itself, however, the evalua-
tion does not possess 3 com-
parable intensity (of
strength.

A portion of the cause for
the preoccupation of previous

ECouncils with the judiciary has

been the desire of the admini-
stration and others to give the
Council the gréatest opportuni-
ty for concentration and effec-
tiveness in the area of her most
important obligation. Thus, re-
sponsibilities in legislative and
deliberative areas were, in
large measure, transferred to
other shoulders. The fact that
these other shoulders are al-
ready burdened, that the Coun-
cil is and will continue to be
a representative and competent
body, and that the judicial
function of student body work
will no longer be hers would
imply that the new proposal
holds abundant promise for
school improvement in the
above-mentioned areas.

Two important parts of
judicially-related function,
to be sure, remain with the
Council, but the responsi-
bilities would be opportuni-

Council's Actions

For the seductive dare

Of a blank sheet of paper
With a concupiscent pen
And since there is

No clergy present

To bless and form the union
Each piece brought forth
Is a woeful little bastard
But is mine nonetheless
And I love each one
Almost as much as they
Ought to love me.

ties rather than burdens.
Specifically, there is the
field of judicial procedure
and the very important
concern of upholding the
Honor System, with special
accentuation of the area of
theft prevention. The past
precedent of Council activi-
ty in these obligations
shows an overbalance of
the functional and prac-
ticing to the detriment of
the contemplative.

The main benefit to the fu-
ture Council, however, would
lie in her freedom to move in-
to partially new and neglected
realms of activity. The entire
orientation program, with par-
ticular emphasis on the aims
and methods of the Court of
Control, needs re-thinking and
perhaps action.

Closely connected is the
realm of school spirit and
its many manifestations or
lack thereof, with stress up-
on the responsibility of up-
Herclassmen therein. Che
pel and Vesper conduct de-
serve continual considera-
tion; the Council should be
in a position to respond ac-
tively and cooperatively to
and with such as the Fresh-
marvinitiated movement for
reform of this fall,

The curriculum deserves fo-
cused student thought, as does
the whole concept of religious
exercises. A somewhat admini-
strative function in the realm
of forums, debates, and current
thought might be self-warrant-
ing. ,

The potential for creative en-
deavor under the new system
would be virtually limitless.
The Council would run the risk
of causing increased confusion
in certain fields, but with the
theoretically good leadership
which she would maintain, the
representativeness and com-

petence of her members, and ,

her new found freedom for re-
sponsiveness she coud minimize
the danger and add some much-
needed direction to a Davidson
immersed in new situations.
