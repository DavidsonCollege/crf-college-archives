The James Knox Batten Pro-
fessorship in Public Policy is sched-
uled to be inaugurated during the
1997-98 academic year at
Davidson College. The Batten Pro-
fessorship search committee,
chaired by Dean of Faculty Robert
Williams, hopes to entice a highly
accomplished professional with
distinguished experience in public
policy to the interdisciplinary po-
sition .

The Batten Professor would

serve for one semester of an aca-
demic year as instructor of two
courses and, in addition, provide a
series of public lectures and semi-
nars.
. After thorough review of all
student and faculty nominations
for the position, the search com-
mittee officially narrowed its se-
lection list to six candidates at a
meeting held on Thursday, No-
vember 7th.

Theconfidential candidate list

has now been submitted to.

Davidson College president, John
Kuykendall, who will approach
the chosen candidates in listed or-
der of priority concerning the of-
fered position.

Williams notes that further
nominations for the professorship
are still encouraged since a new
individual will need to be chosen
for the position annually, and the
receptiveness of the currently des-
ignated nominees has yet to be
gauged.

The Batten Professorship is
made possible through a one-mil-
lion dollar endowment provided
by the Knight Foundation.

The professorship honors the
late James Knox Batten, a
Davidson College alumnus , whose
distinguished career in journalism
and public policy included service
as chairman and CEO of Knight-
Ridder, Inc.

In keeping with the legacy of
James Batten, Williams says, “The
college seeks an active, civic
minded individual whose wisdom
and insight will be an asset to the
entire campus community.”

Davidson College junior Mat-
thew Hobbie, a SGA senator and
member of the Batten Professor-
ship search committee, says of the
committee’s objective: “We really
want to bring a bonafide celebrity
to campus, someone who would be

freely accessible and exciting to ~

converse with regularly on an in-
formal basis.”

Into the Streets Week came
to a close last week, highlighted
bya Michael Stoops Box Sleepout
on Friday and Painting at the Up-
town Men’s Shelter on Saturday.

The Michael Stoops Box
Sleepout was coordinated by
Sophomore Jill Williams. She
conceived the idea during her
trip to Washington, D.C. last
spring, where she worked in a
homeless shelter.

“T spoke with aman who was
interested in starting a library in
the homeless shelters, and it

turned out that he was a Davidson
graduate. At that point I decided
that I wanted to do something to
spread homeless awareness.”

Williams added that the pur-
pose of the sleepout is not to show
students how it feels, “because stu-
dents know that they 'can go back
to there homes in the morning” .
Rather, the sleepout is a “time to
reflect on hunger and learn what it
is.”

There are currently 75 stu-
dents who plan to participate, as
well as two homeless people from
Charlotte, and Michael Stoops, the
head of the National Coalition for
the Homeless.

On Saturday, led by Senior

Last week Noorani and afew
other students worked in the
shelter’s ‘clothes closet’. We dis-
tributed clothes and basic neces-
sities like soap to the homeless
people there,” Noorani says.

Patterson Court also did its
part to support the week with a
Fun Run on Thursday, headed by
Mary Margaret Cochrane, the Ser-
vice Chair of Rusk. Over one
hundred people participated, and
over $300 was raised for the Sda
