Of Duke Endowment Money

In explaining the grant to

were made available by the
trustees of the Duke En-

fic purposes.
$125,000 will be appropri-

compensati Ot, to allow , the
college to compete more
favorably ‘‘inssecuring and
holding the kind of profes-
sors, key administrative of-
ficials and non - atademic
personnel necessary for Da-
vidson's challenging future.”
The library will receive
$62,000 to aid in the current
program of increased acquis-

itions and to expand re-
sources for non - Western
Studies.

The college will acquire a
new system, in-
cluding a computer; an opti-
cal scanner and information

will go -for that purpose.

$10,000 of the fund will
help finance increased fac
ulty research at American
universities and abroad.

endowment will be spent to

many to expect.

Is it true all life insurance costs pretty. much
the same?

A Definitely not! There is a wide variation in the
net cost of life insurance among companies.
I'd like to take this opportunity to familiarize
you with the term “net cost’ as defined by a

leading insurance journal.

Flitcraft Courant indicates that net cost
should, be arrived,at by first adding up all divi-,
dends received. To thenf, add the cash value
of the policy a> a given time. And from that
total, subtract the sum of all premiums paid.

The difference is the net cost of life insur-
ance.

This is the basis the Courant uses for its
“Ten-Year Cost Study,’ which shows North-
western Mutual Life as a national leader in
low net cost among major life insurance com
panies.

For your free copy of this authoritative re-
port, just phone or write me. And at your con-
venience, let’s get together for the full story.
