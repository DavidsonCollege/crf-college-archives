Charlotte High School
Defeated By Serubs

Second-String Five Easily Win on
the Local Floor

The Davidson “Scrub” basketball
squad celebrated the Varsity’s absence
on its trip thru the State by staging «
zame on the local floor Thursday night
vith the Charlotte Highs, and right
vorthily did they perform, swamping
Charlotte by a score of 31 to 6. The
vame was fast and hard fought, but the
Scrubs showed superior team work and
‘need and the game was never in doubt.
The Highs, while rather light, fought
scrappily and made things hum for
their heavier opponents.

All of the men going in the game for
Davidson plaved especially well. R. D.
Hall was the chief scoring factor, to-
talling 17 points of his team’s 31. Wal-
ter Hall was especially effective as a
running guard and his playing was fast
and steady. Williams. the Charlotte
captain, played a good game, as did Aus-
tin. Pharr contributed the only two
field goals made by his team.

The line-up was as follows:
SCRURS. POSITION. CHARLOTTE.
R. D. Hall .. .. .. .. .. McDonald
Alexander .. .. .. .. Austin
Forwards.
McAskill (C) .. .. .. Williams (C)
Center.

W. M. Hall... .. .. . . Pickens
L. L. McAlister .. .. .. .. .. Adams
Guards.

Substitutions—Davidson: Davenport

for Alexander, Potts for McAlister,
Douglas for R. D. Hall. Charlotte:
Pharr for Pickens.

Held Monday Night

Second-Year Men Have Enjoyable

Time in Charlotte
On last Monday night the Soph
Banquet was held in Charlotte. [re was

a splendid success on the part of those
that went—and also on. the part of
those Fresh, Juniors and Seniors who
did not go. According to arrangements
by the manager, the Soph contingent
left the Hill about 3 o'clock on a jitnes
and several Fords. After various punc
tures and thrilling turning of corners
on two wheels—on the part of one Ford
any wav—all the fellows safely arrived
in the Queen City and thence scattered
for the rest of the afternoon and even-
ing till time for the banquet. About
8 o'clock the boys began collecting in
the lobby of the Selwyn Hotel. Every-
one was in great spirits, except mavbe
thase who were on for toasts or speeches.
and some of these were visibly nervous.

to conjure up thase flowery phrases fast
slipping from their brains.

At 9:30 the band struck up and some
forty loyal sons of Nineteen marched
into the dining room where a long table
was spread for the banquet. As all stood
around the table the toastmaster. R. O.
Harris. called for a vell for Nineteen,
and it was given with a will.

What an array of knives, forks and
spoons! More than one furtive glance
was cast on a neighbor to see with what
implement to attack the ovsters which
were set hefore them. Some are in dis-
pute yet over it. However, this did not
affect the capacity of those notables for
the delicious banquet.

The following is the menu as it was
printed on attractive folders fastened
with black and gold ribbon:

class. made an appropriate speech. Next
D. I. McKeithan, the president and
representative of the Senior class, ex
pressed his pleasure at being at the ban-
auet and only wished that the whole
Senior class might enjoy it with him.
J. T. Maddrev. who entered Davidson
in the class of °15, spoke of having
dropped back to the best class, and made
a toast for “Comradeship and Unity.”
Dr. 1. M. McConnell next made a
splendid talk on “Lovalty and Patriot-
ism,” putting it before the fellows that
now, when our country is in danger of
war, is the time to stand behind her and
the administration. H. S, Lott gave an
