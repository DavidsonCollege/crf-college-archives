THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 3, 1928

Phi Society
Diplomas to Grads

For quite a number of years it has been
customary for the Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety to award diplomas for faithful service
in the society. This year the graduating list
from the society: totals 13.

The number this year has reached a higher
mark than in previous ones, Last year there
were a few less than 10 and although the
numbers from year to year vary only a little,
it is sufficient: to see that the interest was
revived. With renewed interest next year
it is hoped that more diplomas will be pre-
sented.

The members of the Phi Society receiving
awards are: B. W. Dickson, W. A. Brown,
D. A. Currie, R. A. Glenn, A. H. McPhaul,
C. F. McRae, B. F. Martin, M. A. Morri-
son, M. C. O’Neal, F. A. A. Phillips, H. T.
Powell, Jr., L. K. Pritchett and W. G.
Smith,

The diploma itself is of a goodly size and
States the name of the society and to whom
it is given. Work in the society with sin-
cere and earnest effort through four college
years is the merit it deserves.

was good would be putting it mildly. The
jokes were clever and the songs were
catchy and pleasing. The audience was in
an exceptionally good humor and was
very appreciative.

The final event of Junior Speaking was

wh ee Column

Following the programs of the Junior
and Freshman classes, the Sophomore class
will have charge of the vesper services, Sun-
day evening. In the Freshman progftam it
will be remembered that Nature was dis-
cussed, while in the Junior service Harllee
Branch ably spoke of Human Nature and
Man as connected with nature. The topic
which will be thought upon on Sunday is not
yet , but it is certain to be interesting
and profitable. Vespers will be held on the
lawn back of the “Y” building at 6:15.

Explaining ‘Y’ Work

A little booklet entitled, “Why the ‘Y’?”
has recently been issued by Jim Appleby, the
“y” ‘secretary. This book was gotten out
‘by the work of Jim and the “Y” Cabinet,
which asked him to do it. This little book-
let deals with the work of the Young Men’s
Christian Association on the Davidson
campjis.

First the pamphlet tells of the history of
the organization here. When the “Y” was
first organized here at Davidson is not cer-
tain. It is first mentioned in the catalogue
of 1878-79. Next the purpose of the “Y” is
given, then the organization. The “Y” has
two governing bodies: the Board of Control
and the Cabinet. The duties of these bodies
are given in detail. The work of the “Y”
is then discussed, dividing it into its different
phases as: Weekly meetings, attendance,
church relations, community work, boys’
work, Sunday Schools, world evangelism,
deputations, freshman work, handbook, vo-
cational guidance, and personal work.

This little booklet is a means of letting
the students and other people know the ex-
tensive work that the “Y” carries on. It
also answers the question, “Why the ‘Y’?”
These books may be gotten free of charge by
calling at the “Y” and seeing Jim.

buckle is a junior-founder of the Pi Kap-
pa Alpha fraternity and has for many
years served as grand councillor of ‘that

The story of the younger Arbuckle’
successes on the campus is one of con-
tinued achievements. His scholastic
averages for his junior year, 1926-27 was
97.88 per cent, the highest in the David-
son student body. He is one of the two
men in his class who have won the dis-
tinction of being members of both Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, national leadership, and
Phi Beta Kappa, national scholastic fra-
ternities, :

“Coffee,” as he is better known on the
campus, has served as president of the
Pan-Hellenic Council, as president of the
renowned. old Eumanean Literary Soci-
ety, as Cadet Major of the local R. O. T.
C. battalion, and as a member of the Y.
M..C. A, Cabinet. Besides being a mem-
ber of the two outstanding honorary fra-
ternities already mentioned he is also a
member of the following honor societies:

ternity, Scabbard and Blade, national mil-
itary fraternity, International Relations

rection. He stated that it is imperative
that we have leaders who are able to con-
trol the vast force that civilization has
given us. In days gone by the man was
not prevented from carrying a stone with
him but now he is prevented from car-
rying a revolver. The 16-year, old was
then allowed to ride a horse but today he
is not allowed to drive a 40-horsepower
motor.

“Instead of the fierce and unqueStioning
loyalty to old statements of faith, will we
not need tolerant and searching criticism
of the old followed by courageous and

creative effort to ofice More give form to

the undying aspirations and dH! Fences
of the human heart?” asked Dean Brad-
shaw in the climax of his speech}.
