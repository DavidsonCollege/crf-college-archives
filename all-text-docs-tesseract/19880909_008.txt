Football team looks better, but still falls 34-16

By BRUCE NEWSOME

Davidson opened its 1988 foot-
ball season looking much better
than last year’s squad; however,
this improvement did not trans-
late into victory as the Presbyte-
rian Blue Hose won.34-16.

Head Coach Vic Gatto saw a
big improvement in the ’Cats ef-
fort compared to last year’s 24-7
loss to the Blue Hose. He said: “I
think we are getting to be a good
football team.”

Sophmore tailback Terry Hines
provided the ‘Cats with an effec-
live running game. In his first
college game at tailback, Hines
gained 87 yards on 21 carries and
scored one touchdown.

Quarterback Peter Hughes also
gave the ‘Cats a good game with
16 of 29 passes completed for 180
yards and one touchdown. How-
ever, he was also intercepted 3
times. Two of the interceptions
were in Davidson territory and
resulted in 2 Presbyterian touch-
downs.

A final plus for Davidson was
the play of the defensive line and
linebackers. They played well
agaist the bigger Presbyterian
offensive line. Senior captain and
defensive end David Lilly, tackle
Mike Rogers, and linebacker
Tony Hubbard all had big games.

However, the play of the defen-
sive secondary proved to be
Davidson’s Achilles’ heel. Pres-
byterian had 6 plays for over 25
yards. One of them was a47 yard
touchdown pass and three others
lead to Blue Hose touchdowns.
The ‘Cats cornerbacks and safe-
ties did not have the speed to keep
up with the Blue Hose receivers
and running backs.

For the first 27:49 of the first
half, the game was evenly played,
and it appeared that there might
be an upset in the making.

With 2:11 remaining in the
half, the ‘Cats trailed only 6-3 and

had blown an earlier scoring op-
portunity. At the start of the sec-
ond quarter Bryan Skelton’s
interception set up Davidson with
a golden opportunity at the Pres-
byterian 28.

In a 13 play series marred by 3

Davidson holding penalties and 2.

Blue Hose penalties, the offense
only moved the ball 2 yards and
Brian Jacob’s field goal attempt
was tipped at the line.

On their next offensive series,
the team showed some maturity
by driving 35 yards to the 9 yard
line. The key to the drive was the
hard running of Hines. The ‘Cats

were unable to get a touchdown,

but Jacob. connected from 26
yards out for a field goal.

Disaster struck when Presbyte-
rian got the ball with 2:11 remain-
ing in the half. The Blue Hose
marched 72 yards in 8 plays and
capped the drive with a 15 yard
touchdown pass.

Rather than going into the
locker room down by only 3 and
having the momentum, Davidson
trailed by 10 and were left shaking
their heads...

The ‘Cats regrouped at half-
time. On their opening posses-
sion, they drove 87 yards. The

series was highlighted by a 40
‘yard touchdown pass . from
Hughes to freshman wide re-

ceiver Horace Hamm _ which -

pulled the ‘Cats within 3 points.
However, the ‘Cats were to get
no closer. Presbyterian, which
entered the game ranked 10th in
the NAIA poll, proved worthy of
their high ranking as they went 74
yards for a touchdown. The scor-
ing play was a 47 yard pass to a
Blue Hose receiver who got well
behind the Davidson secondary.
Davidson did not give up,
though. After another Presbyte-

Kuykendall addrésses Davidson athletic policy

President sees the future as “a very complicated call for the whole community”

By HAP BRYANT
Davidson President | John
Kuykendall shared his insight
into the situation of athletics at the
college in an interview on Tues-
day. As a starting point in the
Davidson hierarchy, Kuyken-
dall’s opinions are important to
understanding the state of
Davidson athletics.
‘He approached such topics as
conference affiliation, the new
_ athletic facility, and the Trustee
athletic policy, giving. his reac-
tion to recent changes in the ath-

letic program.—He indicated that “Eventually, most authorities

many of these changes were in-
evitable given the priorities set up
by the Trustees and the philoso-
phy of other Southern Conference
. schools.

“Our policy, though commit-
3 tngel pinata was taking

en ee ee

us in another direction,” Kuyken-
dall said. He indicated that the
Southern Conference, once sym-
pathetic to Davidson’s objectives,
has changed and has basically left
Davidson behind, parpicnlaety on
the gridiron.

Consequently, “that left us with
very few options” regarding a
football affiliation. With the lack

of success inthe Southern Confer-

ence, Kuykendall said, “‘the Trus-
tees looked on the Colonial

League as our best prospect for
future in Division IAA.”

expectd that membership in the
new Colonial League would al-
ienate the Southem Conference
institutions, who.were no longer
willing to allow Davidson to par-
ticipate in conference sports other
than football while porcompering

for a football conference champi-
onship.

In addition, the Southern Con-
ference had recently. adopted a
requirement for women’s basket-
ball on a Division I level, a re-
quirement that Davidson could
not meet.

Accordingly, Davidson sought
for an extension of the waiver
while conceding that the affili-
ation should terminate. “It
seemed to me that we had made

- our bed in that respect. We didn’t

deserve to stay on our terms... .
We also left with the feeling that

they [the Southern Conference] .

had made a mistake.”

As Davidson now must un-
dergo one or more seasons as an
independent in sports other than
football, Kuykendall reiterated
Davidson’s commitment to a

finding an appropriate conference
affiliation. Presently, he sees the
best opportunity in the Colonial

Athletic Association, consisting :

of teams like Navy, East Carolina,
James Madison, Richmond, and
William and Mary.

However, the Colonial Asso-
ciation’s plans for expansion are
cloudy. Kuykendall said that “we
have been given the promise of a
fair hearing” by the conference,
but “we have not been given sub-
stantial encouragement.”

The search for a conference
affiliation continues, as the ad-
ministration attempts to fulfill the
stipulations of the Trustee Ath-
Tetic policy, drafted in 1973.

“In some respects, we have
come cléser to realizing the pol-
icy than in previous years.”

up an Hines touchdown on a 1

go for the 2 point conversion, but
Hughes was upended short of the
goal line.

Then with 6:50 left and the
‘Cats down by 11, Gatto made an
interesting decision by trying an
onsides kick. The move backfired
as the Blue Hose recovered at the
Davidson 48 and scored 7 plays
later to make the score 34-16.and

tioned the resurgence of the bas-
ketball program under Coach
Bobby Hussey: “Coach Hussey
has put together the kind of pro-
gram that the Trustees hoped for
when they drafted the policy.”
Also, he indicated substantial
success in non-revenue sports,
like baseball, soccer, and
women’s tennis. ~ :
However, he recognizes the
present difficulty of the football
program, saying “the one piece of

. the policy which has not been

fulfilled is obviously the football

“We havé tried as best we can to
fulfill this [the Trustee athletic -
policy]. It’s a mixed picture in
terms of success.”
