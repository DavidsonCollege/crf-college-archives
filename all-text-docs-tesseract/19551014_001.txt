DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1955

NO. 4

at 8 P.M.

By BOYCE MARTIN

Opening both the Homecoming festivities and the Artist
Series for 1955-56 is tonight’s presentation of Melvyn Douglas’s
production “ONE PLUS ONE,” starring Basil Rathbone and
Helen Gahagan Douglas, at 8 p.

Melvyn Douglas, again faithful to
show business tradition, has taken
time from his crowded rehearsal
and performance schedule for the
Broadway production of “Inherit
the Wind,” in which he replaced
Paul Muni when the latter was
forced to undergo surgery of the
eye, to direct and supervise the
entire production of “One Plus
One,” which originally starred Mr.
and Mrs. Douglas.

Mr. Rathbone, who stepped in
at the last minute to replace Mr.
Douglas, is beloved by and familiar
to audiences across the nation as
the creator of his unforgettable
portrait of Sherlock Holmes, and
has more recently been making
triumphs in Terence Rattigan’s
“The Winslow Boy” and on the
screen in “We're No Angels” and
in Danny Kaye's new film “Court
Jester.”

As there are three persons in-
volved in the rehearsals for “One
Plus One,” so will there be three
in the production. Mr. Rathbone
and the Douglases have taken
the liberty of borrowing from
the Chinese theatre tradition,
and there appeared on stage with
them a mysterious character clad
in dark clothes, who assisted the
stars in making the production the
excellent evening in the theatre
that was anticipated.

For Mrs. Douglas this is her
second appearance on the Davidson
campus. She visited Davidson sev-
eral years ago while touring the
country as a Congresswoman from
California.

In addition to the sophisticated
and humorous touch for which
both Mr. and Mrs. Douglas and
Mr. Rathbone are justly renowned,
the program includes selections
from the world’s favorite love
poems, and a beautiful and mov-
ing story of faith by Oscar Wilde,
entitled “The Selfish Giant.” The
program .is rounded out with a

m. in Chambers Auditorium.

from among the works of the
world’s great short story writers
including such authors as Kath-
erine Anne Porter, Chekhov, 0.
Henry, George Moore, and H. G.
Wells.

This is the first of eight events
in the Davidson Artists Series.

The Davidson College Wildcat
Club will meet on Saturday, Octo-
ber 15, as part of the college's
Homecoming activities. The meet-

ing will be held in the David Ovens
College Union at 10 a.m.

The Wildcat Club is composed |

of Davidson alumni interested in
promoting a stronger athletic pro-

gram at the college. Their annual
alumni contributions are designated

for athletic scholarships.
Charles W. McCrary of Asheboro

is president of the club this year,
and Dr. James P. Hendrix of Dur-
ham, treasurer. New officers will
be elected for the year at the Sat-
urday meeting.

The 1955 membership at present
stands at 550, with a total of
$26,000 contributed.

Following the Wildcat Club
meeting dedication of W. H. Belk
Hall will be observed at 10:30, and
the annual Alumni Convocation at
11:00. Assistant Secretary of State
Walter Robertson will address the
convocation.

Washington and Lee Football game

faculty members for open house
parties after the game. A dance

Dr. John Bevan and the Davidson Psychology department

The Ford Foundation has an-
nounced that it is offering Fellow-
ships for the academic year 1956-57
for graduate training in the social
sciences and humanities related to
Asia, the Soviet Union, Eastern
Europe and the Middle East. The
purpose of these fellowships is to
train men who understand and in-

current problems of these areas.

College seniors are eligible to

College professors of literature
take a rather dim view of getting a
taste of the classics along the
comic book route

This they make plain enough in
the new edition of the Going-to-
College Handbook, just published
here.

Instead of whetting the appetite
for a bigger bite of the time-tested
books, this shortcut, they say, can
be expected to do the opposite.

Davidson's Henry T. Lilly
sees a “lessening of the power
and influence of the classics.”
Picture-gazing, he says, does
not help; the profound themes
cannot be dealt with in comic
book fashion; the reader can-
not gain even a small concept
of the poetry, the imagination,
or nobility of phrase of the

dealing with the original.

University of Texas’ Richard C.
Cole, quizzed on the subject, is
“convinced that a work of litera-
ture eludes presentation in any
other way.” He grants that some
good movies have been based on
important novels but he still thinks
much is lost.

Immature Freshmen
Beware of Court

BY JIM BALLENGER

Many students, particularly the
freshmen, have little knowledge of
the importance of the Court of Con-
trol and its members. The Court
has the highly responsible job of

|

developing the immature, uncouth

. | freshmen into the fine Davidson

gentlemen that they should be.
Judge Hobby Cobb is doing a
splendid job as head of the Court
and should be commended by ev-
eryone, Hobby has expressed his
thanks to the upperclassmen, and
in particular, the pledge trainers
of each fraternity, for getting the
freshmen back in line after their
childish outbreak of last week.
Hobby reminds the freshmen that
their caps are still to be worn in-
definitely and name tags are not
to be taken off until Friday night.
The freshmen will be glad to
know that the campusing will only
last from Monday, October 17,
through the following Friday, in-
stead of through Monday as pre-
viously announced. This change has
‘been made because of the dance at
College next Saturday
night.
