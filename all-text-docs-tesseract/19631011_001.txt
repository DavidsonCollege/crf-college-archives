Davidson Plans Program
For Year's Foreign Study

BY TOM LOFLIN

Davidson College's Foreign
Study Committee has begun
making plans this semester for
what it hopes will turn into this
school’s own program for a
year’s study in France and Ger-
many,

The program Is only a possi-
bility thus far, but the commit-
tee has already drawn up a list
of alternatives for a plan which
will have to be decided upon by
the Curriculum Committee and
the entire faculty and then ap-
proved by the administration be-
fore Davidson's junior year a-
broad is a reality.

Dr. J. O. Embry, chairman of
the Foreign Study Committee,
.said that President D. G. Mar-
tin was the man actually respon-
siblé for the planning of a pro-
gram. “It was his idea in the
first place for Davidson to spon-
sor a year abroad; the commit-
tee is merely trying to work out
the details.”

Embry said that there were
two main reasons that such a
program might never be ap-
proved by the faculty and ad-
ministration. The first is the
fact thet such a project would
cost the college extra money.
“The biggest investment the
school would have to make
would be to hire two new pro-
fessors, one in French and the
other in German, since a pro-
fessor from each department
would have to accompany a
gfoup to the two countries.’

Embry said that despite the
high enthusiasm now present in
the language departments of the

school, some professors outside
of the field were not very im-
pressed by a foreign program
since “they would be losing
some top students for a year.”
“A thing that would be nice
now is for some fund or foun-
dation that really believes in
this type of project to donate
the school some money fo help
shoulder the added burden,”
Embry said. “After all, the
Richardson family brings a
pretty good-size group of for-
eign students over here every
year. Why not have a program
working in reverse whereby
some of our top students could
get the same type of exper-
ience foreign students get
over here?”

Embry stated that 20 sopho-
more French students so far had
expressed a definite interest in
a Davidson program if it ever
becomes a reality. The German
department has between 15 and
20 sophomores signed up as in-
terested. And 20 freshmen, who
would not be eligible next year,
have expressed interest in going
overseas in their junior year.

The proposed Davidson For-
eign Study Plan states that stud-
ents could spend either a semes-
ter or a year abroad during
their junior year. They would
pay only a small addition to
their regular fees at Davidson,
if not, indeed, the exact amount.
for an entire year's work. The
committee has proposed that
students receive their regular
scholarships while abroad.

The plen also states, “The
program is especially recom-

mended for language majors,
but it is open to others who
can work out a feasible pro-
gram and secure the approval
of the department of their
major.

“The students will be enrolled
as regular students in the for-
eign university and will have no
special courses set up for Ameri-
cans with the exception of the
seminar meeting with the Dav-
idson professor present.

“The students will have two
advisers: a member of the facul-
ty of the university he is at-

_tending and a member of the

faculty of Davidson.”

The plan provides several! al-
ternatives for the transfer of
grades and credits. One pro-
posal is that students keep a
record of all work done and all
examinations taken and present
them to Davidson professors
after their return. If it were
fett by the faculty that a student
needed an examination in a cer-
tain course, then he would be
given one. This is the plan cur-
rently in effect for those stud-
ents who travel abroad under
other programs.

Two other ideas have been
suggested. One is to let David-
-son professors give supple-
mentary reading lists to over-
seas students and then ad-
minister by mail all .examina-
tions and tests. The student
would then receive regular
credit in a specific course at

Davidson. In the past, travel-

ers have had to transfer cred-
it from overseas.

‘Open End’ Allows Choice
Of Unrestricted Subjects

A professor may speak as he p.
stated purpose of the new series

Lounge at 10 p.m. on
professors.

The “Open End” series is not
necessarily a news program.
“We have given the professors
complete freedom in chodsing
tReir topics,” emphasized Paul
Simpson, the Union Roundtable
Committee of one. ‘The profs
will speak on whatever they're
especially ‘up’ on.” These topics -
may be on something the stud-
@fts don’t expect, as Dr. D. W.
Tucker's talk of the Spanish
Armada, or on just.what will in-
terest the students.

,The “Open End” series re-
places the. now-defunct Review
the News. “Review the News
was a news program,” explained
Simpson. “Only a few people,
maybe a dozen or’ so, ‘were ket:

ting anythitg out of it. The same
people came every Monday
night. We want to appeal to
more Students éach week; by
variety, we hope--to regch the
whole student body at least once
during the -year.”

The series has done just that.

The response has been excellent:

for the usually apathetic student
body, according to Simpson.
Dean Richard C. Burts conduct-
ed the first “Open End” lecture
and willingly stayed afterwards
until 12:15 to answer all the
questions. Dr. Tucker's speech
on the Spanish Armada was
termed excellent by’ al} the-styd-
ents who were there. Dr. G. L.

was heard by 150-200 people.

The crowds at the “Open End”
series have proved Simpson
right-in the time and format for

. the series. The ten p,m. pro-

grams are set at the time when
a student usually takes a break
from his studies and comes over
to the Union. The programs are
short and snappy, letting the
more studioustninded head back
to the dorms after a few power-
packed minutes.

Up and coming in the series
are two outspoken members of
the faculty, professors C. E.
Lloyd and E. F. Patterson. Lloyd
plans to speak ‘on Oct. 16 with
“How To Make Enemies?” Pat-
terson hopes to set ‘the record
straight about “Kennedy’s Tax
Program” qn Oct. 30.

The. Roundtable ‘Forum, a
series of special Thursday night
programs, opened last night
with a film and .hot discussion
of the civil rights questions.
“The Roundtable Forum,” en-
visioned Simpson, “is to give
students a chance to discuss a
wide range of important topics
with authorities in that field.”

The forums scheduled so far
are:

Oct. 27 — Dr. Dan Rhodes on

the Faculty Loyalty Oath, 10

p.m.. Union Lounge.

Nov. 14 — Dr. R. S. Rankin.

chairman of the department of !
political science at Duke, on:

president of the American

Medical Association, at chapel.

day night.

March ? — Capt. Bart Slattery,
Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville,
Ala., at chapel and Thursday
night.

Simpson has cooked up one
last morsel to throw into the
fire. After spring holidays a new
series will begin, called the
“Last Lecture.” The situation is
this: if the professor knew he
were going to die the next day,
which last lecture would he give
to his students? An interesting

thought, according to Simpson.

= Two Vie For Editor

= Of ’64-’65 Handbook -

Roger David and Ed Stopher are the candidates of
the Publications Board in the election for the editor of the
1964-65 Wildcat Handbook to be held Monday after

Both candidates contributed to this year’s handbook.
Stopher was business manager while David served as as-

sociate editor.

David is a junior from Winston-Salem. A sports
writer for THE DAVIDSONIAN last year, he is also on
the staff of Quips and Cranks. An ATO, David's major is

pre-medicine.

. From Louisville, Ky. Stopher, also a junior, is a mem-
ber of Beta Theta Pi social fraternity.. He will take a,
history honors major, and possibly a second major in

economics.

In previous years the Wildcat Handbook editor has
attended the American Collegiate Press Convention, held
some time in October. The handbook will have no repre-
sentative this year, however, because of a deficit in funds.

The candidates expressed their plans, if elected, for,
the next handbook in separate statements to THE DAV-

IDSONIAN:
Roger David

I feel that the Wildcat Hand-
book serves a dual purpose —
first. to introduce’ incoming
freshman to Davidson College.
to answer questions they may
have before arriving, and to
make their adjustment to their
new environment easier; and
second, to provide useful infor-
mation for the entire student
body.

With this end in view. 1 feel
that last year's edition of the
Handbook has come nearer to
fulfilling its purpose than any
published so far. I again this
year will emphasize the read-
ability and perhaps expand the
editorial comment in an effort
to give the freshman a student's
point of view.

But for this point of view to
be more reflective of the gen-
eral attitude of the student
body, I plan to make definite
assignments of each section to
a different member of the staff.
Last year the editor and I did
a great majority of the writing
ourselves, and I feel the quality
of the writing, in addition to the
diversity, could be improved by
a delegation of responsibility..

I plan also to retain the gen-
eral format of last year's edi-
tion, with éssentially only minor
changes and additions. I'd like,
for one thing. to have each
freshman’s room number under
his ‘picture. Perhaps the weak-
est section in the past has been
the athletic section.

Here I plan to have a sports
editor who will present a sum-

mary of the preceding year's
season for cach intercollegiate
sport and who will try to make
predictions on the outlook for
the following year. In addition,
I'd like. to present a better pic-
ture of extra-curricular and cul-
tural opportunities, since many
are unknown even to upper-
classmen.

Ed Stopher

The primary purpose of the
Wildcat Handbook is to serve as
a guide to the incoming fresh.
men; however, I wouid like to
extend its usefulness to the en-
tire student body beyond orien-
tation and rush week. By in-
cérporating more student ideas
and more information on cam-
pus activities and events, the
handbook can serve as a guide| #
to both freshmen and upper-
classmen throughout the school
year.

It is my intention to maintain
and improve the quality of this
year’s handbook without over-
reaching its budget. By increas-
ing advertising and trimming
costs, the quality of this pub-
lication can be maintained with-
out a financial deficit to the col-
lege.

The usefullness of the hand-
book can be greatly increased
by the inclusion of a student di-
rectory and a listing of fresh-
man room numbers under their
name and picture. If possible,
I would like to add the sched-
ules of all athletic events and
other campus activities planned
for the coming year.

African Reporter Second
In Great Issues Series

The YMCA Great Issues Program will feature its
second speaker of the semester when Stewart King, a
former reporter in the Union of South Africa, addresses

the Monday assembly.

McKay received his AB from
Baker University, an MA from
Syracuse, his PhD from Cornell
and in 1961, a LLD from Baker.
He has held a number of posi-

tions, among these as lecturer

on African affairs at the Uni-
versity of Stellenbosch in South

Africa. McKay has served both:

National Review Polls
Davidson, Nine Others

BY CHARLES L. DIBSLE

“An enormous 78 per cent of Davidson students who have reacted against their
religion while at college list ‘courses dealing with religion’ as a cause (its nearest
competitor is Stanford, where 30 per cent list religious courses as a reason).”

The results of a poll taken at
Davidson and nine other colleges
appear in. the Oct. 8 issue of
Nations! Review, the “only in-
tellectual fortnightly of the
right.” ’ .

The surprised commentary on
the poll continues: ‘And of. the
82 per cent of Davidson under-
graduates who have experienced
an anti-religious reaction, (itself
the largest. percentage. of any
college in the poll), 56 per cent
say that ‘significant doubt be-
gan’ while they were at college,
39 per cent in the, freshman

year .alone. Despite its Presby-’

terian affiliation, then, David-

son scarcely appears to be con-.

ducive to retention of -religious
faith.”

The discussion-sparking poll was
taken by Educational Reviewer,
Inc.. of which Russell Kirk is
president, and is the same as
that employed in the spring of
1959 by the Harvard Crimson to
probe the religious and political
views of the undergraduate stud-
ent bodies of Harvard and Rad-
cliffe Collezes. The scope of the
poll. has been increased to -in-
clude 12 colleges, each of which

“was chosen to typify a certain,

style of education.” The students
“represent, in every

McKay's topic will be “Africa; bined number of sophomore.

in World Politics” and his talk] junior.

and senior undergrad-

will be based on his book by the} uates in the college in question.”

Same name.

SPEAKER JAILED

The scheduled Great Issues speaker for Oct. 31, the
Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, will be unable to appear because
he was jailed this week in Southern Rhodesia by the British
government for “agitation.” However, the Great Issues
Committee has contacted the newly appointed Under-Sec-
retary of the United Nations Department of Trusteeship for
the Non Self Governing Nations, Godfrey J. K. Amachrec.
He is a Nigerian who received his education at Cambridge
University.

Commented Walter MacDonald, chairman of the Great
issucs Committee of the YMCA, on the substitution, ‘it’s
unfortunate that we hed to change, but one can‘t fight the
British Empire.”

Davidson religious tenets con-

, tinued to surprise the pollsters.

In further commentary they
wrote:."At only four colleges in
the poll do majorities 6f
Christians accept the concept of
God becoming fle h. At David-
son College—a Southern school
affiliated with Presbyterianism
~half of the student body re-
jects this..fhe central tenet of
Christianity.”

Yet 88 per cent of the David-
son students polled indicated
that they would bring their chil-
dren up in their own religious
tradition, which—in the case of
$4 per cent of the Davidsonians
—is Protestantism.

The pollsters also discovered:

“At Davidson, the comparison
between frequency of belief in
the Resurrection and in Christ's

divinity is as striking as the Tat-
ter figure (50 per cent) is dlone.

At this, a Christian-affiliated
school located squarely in Chris-
tian-oriented North ‘Caroling,
less than’ 21 per cent of the ‘stud-
ent body ‘believes that Christ
was resurrected.

“Even at unabashedly secular
campuses like Williams, Sarah
Lawrence, and Yale, larger per-
centages of Christian students
accept this tenet than at Pres-
byterian-supported Davidson.”

But these same Davidson stud-
ents express the largest dissent.
¢70 per cent) to “I do not believe
any specific religious faith or
the denial of religious faith
should be discussed in the pub-
lic schools.” Ninety-six per cent
(the largest reported) of these
students attended Sunday School
five or more years. Ninety-one
per cent (the largest reported)
read the Bible either occasion-
ally or frequently. And 74 per
cent (again the largest group of
any of the polled schools) read—
at east oceasionally— from “con:
temporary theologians such: as
Niebuhr. Maritain, Buber.”

A large portion of the stud-
ents—seven out of ten—find tae
practice of religion at college
different from the practice of
religion at home. Seventy-one
per cent—far higher than scc-
ond-place Stanford's 35 ner cent
—reveal that they read more

about religion-at Davidson while -

a high 48 per. cent claim they

ahink more about religion here.

Surprisingly, despite required
religious exercises at Davidson
63-per cent of the students quer-
ied reported that they attended
services more regularly at home.

Percentage-wise, Davidson. the
poll states, has the largest
group of conservative students
(44%) and the smallest group of
liberal students (no “radicals”
and 34% “moderate liberals’).
Of the ten colleges polled Dav-
idson also had the largest num-
ber (18%) of politically indif-

ferent pupils. Twice as many
students have gone from con-
servative to more liberal (38%)
than from liberal ‘to more con

‘servative (18%). But only six

per cént have gone from idberal
to more liberal,

Referring to, the two Southern
schools (University of. South
Carolina and Davidson), the poll
takers state: “The political con-
sciousness of both schools is

-mirrored in mass student defec-

tions from. the Democratic
Party. Davidson’ parents are $3
per.cent Democratic and 41 per
eemt Republican: Davidson stud-
ents are 36 per cent Republican
and 26 per cent Democratic.

‘More than half of Davidson's

students from Democratic fami-
lies, then, have shed their tra-
ditional party label; many of
those who remain Democrats
are also liberal.”

Given the choice of a world
war with the Soviet Union or
surrender to the Soviet Union.
Davidsonians reflect general
feeling. Eighty-two per cent
would prefer war to surrender.
However. at the other extreme
are Reed (25%) and Brandeis
(32%) with minorities favoring
war, Only 18 per cent of David-

son's pupils approved “immed-
iate unilateral suspension of.
atomic testis by the United

States” when responding last
spring while 78 per cent regis-
tered opposition.

“One of the few areas, the
opinion collectors discovered;
“of general agreement in the
poll has ta do with right-to-work
laws. Every school in the
poll excep: Sarah Lawrenee has
a substantial majority either
‘definitely in favor’ or ‘some-
what in favor’ of such a law,
and at.no schoo] does a plurality
disapprove of the measure... .

“The most determined opposi-
tion comes from Sarah Lawrence
(27 per cent definitely opposed);
the most impressive assent
comes, not from South Carolina,
but from Howard, Brandeis, In-
diana, and Davidson, in that or-
