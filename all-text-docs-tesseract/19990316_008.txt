THE DAVIDSONIAN

“Gloria” infuses DCPC

DCCC, DCSO shine in Vivaldi concert

By At G. P. STERLING

Last Thursday night, the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church sanctuary played host to an
inspiring collaborative effort by two of Davidson’s
premiere musical ensembles. The Davidson Col-
lege Chamber Singers, accompanied by the DC
Symphony Orchestra, delivered a moving perfor-
mance of Antonio Vivaldi’s “Gloria” before an
appreciative audience. The concert presented a
unique opportunity for students, faculty, and com-
munity members to see an exquisite staple of Ba-
roque choral repertoire performed both live and for
free.

The involvement of many talented faculty
members set this performance apart from your aver-
age Chamber Singers gig. Voice instructors Diane
Thornton and Alicia Purcell joined the Chambers
Singers as soloists for the “Gloria,” giving perfor-
mances of the highest caliber. Professor William D.
Lawing supplemented the orchestra on trumpet,
while Cynthia Lawing provided continuo accompa-
niment on harpsichord. Professors Homer Sutton
and Mary Thornberry also joined the student choir
and symphony, respectively. The participants rep-
resented a spectrum of students and faculty from
across the campus.

The well-dressed combined ensemble offered
a finely shaped, focused performance, fraught with
meticulous detail from both the choir and orchestra.
Maestro Richard Prior guided the proficient singers
and string players with assertive direction. The
church shuddered with applause upon the conclu-
sion of the “Gloria,” as about 600 pairs of hands paid
homage to the hard work and hours of preparation
that the groups had spent.

The concert opened with the campus debut of
the Davidson College String Quartet, featuring four
freshman string players (Nina Somers, Christoph
Ruland, Ross Fenimore, and Molly Strand). They
gave a spirited performance of the popular “Canon
in D” by Johann Pachelbel and the first movement
from Dvorak’s String Quartet No. 6 (“American”).

Senior Deanna Yard joined the DCSO on
oboe, while cellist Lauren Baird added to the
continuo. Baird will be prominently featured in the
DCSO’s spring concert (April 22nd in Love Audi-
torium), as the winner of this year’s DCSO Concerto
Competition. She will be performing the Lalo Cello
Concerto, on a program which will also include the
overture to Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” and
Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 1.” Everyone should
make plans to attend.

Pisces (Febraury 18 - March 20

Practically Perfect Pisces needs to watch her back. Avoid picking up stray pets and remember that anything
in moderation will serve you well. Be confident of impending bliss on the 17th and no matter what anyone says
happy-go-lucky is the best way to be. A jealous freshman attempts to get the better of you but remain poised
and assured that the planets have cursed the wretched beast for eternity.

Aries (March 21 - April 19)

Mental images of shriveled prunes and other celestial fruits haunt Aries’ dreams but everything is going to be
A-OK. After this weekend you need some rest and relaxation so don’t shy away from flipping on WALT 1610
am on Wednesday night at 9 for a little comic relief. They like it Raw and heard that you do too. Wear more
pink and you’ll be lucky in love and money on the 1Sth.

Taurus (April 20 - May 19)

Look out, Taurus. People are sitting up and taking notice of your toned, athletic figure and cool, suave
personality. Few can work a room with your pinache and you know it! Stop wearing ribbons and pastels to up
your stock value considerably with the opposite sex.

Gemini (May 20 - June 20)

Your mood sways you into the Romantic folds of Dark Poetry. Beware of over-zealous Aries on the 12th and
too much Bran the night before a test. An admirer from the West Coast forces nonconfrontational Gemini to
get tough!

Cancer (June 21 - July 21)

March brings emphasis on Luck and thoughts of hard work. Beware of little blondes hurtling over banisters
because your mama is a long way away. Befriend a Pre-Med student. You'll be glad you did. You are finding
your musical tastes swayed by an R&B fan which bodes well for your future.

Leo (July 22 - August 22)

Lucky Leo has a best friend looking out for him all month long. But you better watch it, Leo, because the planets
have it in for you and mortal aid will only get you so far. Beware of law enforcement officials banging loudly
on your door at night and dented canned goods. Food poisioning would ruin the weekend. Try to make it to
next week without getting stale. ,

Virgo (August 23 - September 21)

Your jealousy of others’ successes is highly unnecessary, Virgo, as your very own adventures are just around
the corner. Lucky love days were from the Sth to the 8th so I hope that they were climactic. Your job search
is coming to a close so take a flying leap at exciting opportunities. Do not attempt to have children this month
because they will be born cross-eyed.

Libra (September 22 - October 22)

The planets think that tall and skinny Libra should wear cotton underpants and switch back to Regular.
Fortunately for you, Libra, it is going to be one hot month because the stars indicate lucky love days all month
long! Beware an envious Virgo looking to put out your love fires in April.

Scorpio (October 23 - November 21)

Play the Game, Scorpio, it’s your time in the Spotlight! Avoid aggressive Libras who jealous and who would
influence you to blow it. The planets predict continuous confrontations with professional dancing but remember
that you could slip on too much sunscreen.

Sagittarius (November 22 - December 20)

The R&B phase you have been going through will end soon, but don’t worry, Sagittarius! -Your friends and
roommates will bail you out. Love is right around the corner, but don’t be disappointed if it gets snowed in,
These things happen but the planets have everything under control. Your day is coming so don’t forget that
shower!

Capricorn (December 21 - January 19)
The stakes are at an all-time high and you find yourself wondering, “How did I get here?” Not to worry,
Capricorn. Venus and Mars say that you will be Ooooh so Lucky in Love on the 20th.

Aquarius (January 20 - February 17)

Water boys never get the respect that they deserve but don’t worry, Aquarius, your time is almost here. Watch
out for jealous women and angry Scorpios. Word is out among the elite that you are looking for Love and they
are willing to help you find it. Try not to stick your foot in your mouth this time.
