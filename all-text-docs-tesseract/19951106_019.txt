The secrets.
of dove
hunting

By JoHN Rog
Outdoors Columnist

No matter how you choose to
hunt doves, there will always be
plenty of fun to go around.

Some choose to meet in large
groups and take to the field in
between rounds of ribs and lemon-
ade, while others get up at strange
hours and hunt alone. Many prefer
to move around and cover lots of
ground, but just as many are con-
tent to sit near the cooler and keep
cool and hydrated, firing a shot
every now and then.

THE GREAT

OUTDOORS

One thing all dove hunters ~

must have in common, however, is
a fine shooting eye and a knack for
knowing what types of land attract
doves.

A field that I regularly hunted
at home served as a good teaching
ground for me. For instance, I no-
ticed that the first person to limit
out every time was sitting at the
intersection of a fence row and a
powerline. Why the guy at this
spot limited out fast than anyone
else was a mystery toe until I actu-

ally hunted this spot one after- |

noon.

Nearly every dove that en-
tered the field used a fly line along
the fence row or the power line.
This naturally brought almost ev-
ery dove right over my head unless
it was diverted by another hunter’s
arrant shots.

Doves seldom fly aimlessly
over open spaces with no frame of
reference on the ground. Flying
along forest edges, roads. or even
toward a lone tree in the middle of
a field provides the dove with di-
rection. If you can pick out the
most used flyway, get ready for
some fast wingshooting.

Picking the best flyway, how-
ever, is an on-the-field adjustment.
Finding the best area to hunt should

be the first step to a successful -

hunt. Soybean, corn, sunflower and
millet fields seem to always attract
hungry doves, but one often over-
looked hot spot is on the edge of a
pond or creek.

Doves need water just as any
other critter would, but just any
water will not do. The water must
be in an open area with minimal
cover around the banks. A dove
will only land if it feels safe, and
large open area provide a large
field of view for the birds to spot

potential dangers before it is too ©

late. Finding promising areas and

analyzing them to determine the _

best set-up spot can determine how
many birds you bring down, but
being a good shot is by far the most
important aspect of the hunt.

Whether you are hunting at
the social gathering on opening
day or whether you prefer to hunt
along, remember these tips. You
might be surprised at just how well
your next hunt goes.

Rugby suffers
2nd straight loss

By Warren Burorp
Staff Writer

The rugby. team capitalized
on three weeks of training and
played a tough, organized game

against UNC-Wilmington, but the .

Wildcats couldn’t get on the

scoreboard. On another sopping -

wet Saturday, UNC-Wilmington
took a 15-0 win.

RUGBY

The first try, in only the fifth
minute, resulted from good back
play by UNC-Wilmington. Their
forwards won the ball in the ruck,
and the scrum half eventually got
the ball in the back and ran straight
into the try zone.

Team captain Bob
Yarborough said this forced the
Wildcats to in increase their inten-
sity. “We couldn’t let them score

again so we had to play hard and
play smart,” he said. “For the most
part, we really played well. Our
forwards, especially, played great.”

Davidson’s tough defense kept
UNC-Wilmington out of the try
zone during the rest of the half, but
the Wildcats’ offense wasn "tkeep-
ing up,

The backs were not able to run
numerous’ plays, hurting
Davidson’s chances to score.

The second half saw two trys
by UNC-Wilmington. One came
off a blocked kick, and the second
was scored when UNC-
Wilmington recovered a loose ball
near the try zone.

“Our practice paid off, because
I think we played well,” rugby
president Thayer Long said. “This
loss is of course disappointing, but
we know what it takes to be a
winning team. Next week, we will
prove that to our fans.”

The Wildcats close out their
fall season Saturday against West-
ern Carolina.

Burr burns her way to all-conference

By Humes FRANKLIN

Freshman Suzy Burr had her-
self quite a day Oct. 29 at the
Southern Conference Cross-Coun-

CROSS COUNTRY

try championships at Furman.
Not only did Burr finish sixth
overall, earning all-conference

honors, but she was also named
conference Freshman of the Year.

Burr ran the 5-kilometer
course in Greenville, S.C., in 19
minutes one second. Her sixth-
place finish is the highest for a
Davidson runner.

“Suzy ran really well,”

“women’s coach Beth Puckett said.

“Tt’s great that she’s up there run-
ning with the best runners in the
conference as a freshman.”
Overall, Davidson finished
seventh out of eight teams, beating
Georgia Southern. Other top fin-

ishers for the Wildcats were Janet
Aardema, Marie Grisez and Beth
Brewster.

It was a slightly disappointing
day forthe men’s team as Davidson
placed ninth out of 10 teams. The
Wildcats, who had hoped to finish
ahead of VMI and Georgia South-
ern had to settle for beating only
the host Paladins.

Sophomore Josh Cookson
continued to lead the Wildcats, fin-
ishing 21st overall. Highlighting
the race was senior Eric Collings.
Having never finished in the team’s

top five, Collings finished fourth
for Davidson.

“] just went out and raced
hard,” he said. “I wanted to leave
everything I had on the course to-
day, and that’s what I did.”

Captain Dave Foss took sec-
ond for the Wildcats, followed by
Jonathan Fly, Collings and Tripp
Franklin.

Both teams will have a chance
to improve on their performances
on Furman’s course on Saturday
during the season-ending NCAA
Region II Championships.

Former North Mecklenburg star transfers

_ -Chip Stewart, a former North
Mecklenburg High star lineman
and one of the strongest players in
college football, recently trans-
ferred to Davidson from Gardner-
Webb.

The 6-0, 297-pound fine
will be eligible next season and

will have two seasons of eligibility
left. Stewart played offensive line
last season.

Atthe NFL-sponsored Invita-
tional Camp in Indianapolis in Feb-
ruary, Stewart bench pressed 225
pounds 46 times, topping the pre-
vious record of 37 held by

Nebraska’s Brendan Stai. Stewart
also holds the American record for
the teenage and junior heavyweight
divisions for the bench press. He
also has lifted 650 pounds in the
squat and over 500 pounds in the
bench press.’ «

“We can use both his size and

strength,” football coach Tim
Landis said. “We anticipate him
making a solid contribution to our
program. Although the Wildcats
tentatively consider him an offen-
sive lineman, Stewart could play

- defense or go both ways.”
