Where did the time go?

Where did the time go? I
don’t want to be a senior and think
about “life choices” yet! I want to
sit around and discuss Amanda’s
Melrose motives (and haircut) and
take naps and go to the Union to
see if all the green sourballs are
gone yet. I can’t be a real person
and wear uncomfortable shoes ev-
ery day!

As my senior year ticks away,
I can still relish the carousing and
debauchery of bleary college nights
— but not with the same reckless
abandon I enjoyed as a freshman.
It’s off to the career center and to
writing resumes and beating down
a three-year thick wall of denial.

In other words, I’mseethingly
jealous of all you first-year stu-
dents who come parading in here
without one worry. Soon, unfortu-

nately, you will be beaten to a pulp
academically (and have only C’s
and D’s to show for it). But cheer
up! Davidson does have many
positive aspects, I swear! :
So, as brand new members of
the freshman class, I am leaving
you witha few things that are amaz-
ing about Davidson College life:
1) You don’t have to pay for
beer. Of course, this is pending the
proposed Court social fees and.
excludes semester dues for eating

‘houses and fraternities, but the

pointis, my friends, that on adrink-
for-drink basis, the Court is free!
How appalling to spend over $3 on
one measly beer! I vowed never to
curse the Court again (a huge feat
for someone who has spent any-
time here at all).

2) Harris Teeter is open 24

hours. Oh, to wander the aisles of
the Teet.

For those of you not from the
area, HT not only has a fabulous

selection of fine goods ready for’

purchase any time of day or night,
but you can also get one free cookie
(honor bound) at the door.

3) You don’t need a fake I.D.
Party on! Don’t worry, unlike your
friends who chose the bar scene at
state universities, you can have fun
without false identification, (that
is if you’re in the shrinking minor-
ity at Davidson whoactually leaves
the dorm after 10 ...).

4) The Pub’s jukebox. This
unit of tunes has a plethora of med-
leys for both locals’ and students’
enjoyment. However, sometimes
it lies silent because pub-goers are
spending their parents’ money on

The length of youth

He had tried to apologize a
few days before then. Lavoided his
eyes and walked away, convinced
my disappointment would keep me
from accepting his apology.

The next day, I approached
him. I forced out my words —
describing my anger and disap-
pointment as fairly as I could. I
searched ia his eyes for recogni-
tion: some sense of truth. He looked
~ back witha deep sense of shame —
so deep that it startled me.

He nodded and then apolo-
gized; his eyes still holding pain in
disappointing me with his actions.
Satisfied that he understood, I
quickly teased him to bring a smile
back to his face. It was his smile I
loved. Sweet and wide, it showed
his resilience and strength.

Now, he stood before theclass
with an awkwardness I had never
seen. His tall frame shrank and his
hands pulled uncomfortably at the
sides of his shorts. He looked at
the wall, the floor and, finally, at
her.

She stood, proud and beauti-
ful. Her smile revealed a mild
discomfort. Her demeanor, how-
ever, showed an incredible patience

for his anxiety. She leaned for-
ward, inviting him to say what he
thought of her.

The assignment seemed
simple. One person in the class
stood at the front and another class-
mate complimented him or her.
Fifty students sat in the audience
waiting. With each passing mo-
ment of silence, they, too, leaned
forward in anticipation.

He licked his lips and then
broke the silence; his tenor voice
filling the room.

“T think you are very pretty
and smart.and you’re the most
mature girl in this class. And you
are really sweet and ...”” The pause
built to an incredible climax; we
all waited expectantly for his final
words.

“And I just hope that I can
marry you one day.” His tall frame
collapsed into his seat. The class
erupted in applause and cheers,
She ran back to her seat — some-
what thrilled and slightly embar-
rassed. The guys were slapping
him on the back and calling out.
The girls shrieked in delight while
she tried to disappear into herchair.

Later, I stole him away to talk.

“I’m really proud of you. I
know what you said was hard but I
could tell you really meant it. Not
enough people — especially. 16-
year-old males — have the cour-
age to reveal their emotions. You
did in a big way, and I am proud of
you for it.”

He smiled back, pleased and
shy.

“She came and asked me if I
meant what I said after class. I told
her that I did, but the next time I ask
her I will be on my knees because
that is what.she deserves.”

He hugged me, whispered
“Thanks” and ran off tohis friends.

I marveled in his courage that
night. His sincerity; his willing-
ness to say what he really thought;
to expose himself at an age and
time where the repercussions could
be painful or devastating. Ireveled
in his simplicity in doing what he
needed to do; in saying what needed
to be said; in loving because he
simply wanted to love. He had to
open up, dive into the confessional
and free himself from private
thoughts.

Youth is that time where you
dream that dream, believe in it and

pool, etc. So, since everyone knows
freshmen spend more money than
anyone else until they realize in
November they have $11.72 to last
them a month and a half, I invite
you to put money in the jukebox
and hear for yourself (“All My
Life” by Aaron Neville and Linda
Ronstadt is a personal favorite,
thanks).

If you’re low on funds, don’t
fret because, as frequently-
strapped-for-cash Anne Tilghman
McEaddy often reminds me,
“Freebird (live)” will last an entire
pool game. What song is it you
want to hear?

5) The art of Commons watch-

‘ing. The cultivation of this skill

should command the utmost atten-
tion from every first-year Davidson
student. Vail Commons at dinner

is prime time for freshman inspec-
tion. The key, as any Vail veteran
will tell you, is good positioning.
Get there early and stay late for the
best show.

Be sure to notice those poor
souls who wander out of the line
with full trays unable to find their
friends. Inevitably, they try to
look cool while madly scanning
both rooms for familiar faces. If
desperate, these folks will even
resort to feigning a trip to the salad
bar in order to stall and regroup.

So, aren’t you glad you came
to Davidson? What a wealth of
stimulating cultural activities we
enjoy! Anyway, take it from an
old poop with only two more se-
mesters left; take advantage of the
time you have here. Four years go
by incredibly fast.

carry it to fruition. It can take a
long time to be young. The mo-
ment that one loosens up, dreams
big, chooses uncertainty and acts
in the name of love — whatever
that love may be — is when one
becomes young.

I had scolded him days be-

fore because he had disappointed
me. On this night, I held him in the
most divine light for teaching me
to speak my love without apology;
to show my passion without re-
morse; to share myself without
expectations; to embrace youth
without hesitation.

Jéfe’s pocket guide to Europe

While travelling in Europe this
summer, I continually found the
moron level of American tourists
amazingly high. Of course, I also
was one of these clueless voyag-
ers, and if I cultivated anything
while overseas it was a distinct
talent for making a fool out of
myself in several cultures (a prac-
tice which I seem to have mastered
here in the States as well).

However, I did manage to.

make a few observations about
European life that may help out a
few of you future travellers or
study-abroaders, So pay attention,
this is Jeff's Pocket Guide to ole’
Europa:

First, appreciate the ready
availability of air conditioning and
deodorant in the United States. I
always thought those Right Guard

adds were corny until I spent about
four and a half hours wedged be-
tween two hairy, sweaty Belgian
women in a non-air conditioned
train. Trust me, that’s not the kind
of menage anyone in their right
mind wants.

Second, when hailing a taxi in
Germany keep your fingers spread
and avoid lifting your arm up ina
stiff military fashion. They’ re sorta
sensitive about that whole Hitler/
Word War II thing, and you don’t
want to make any movements that
may resemble that “Hail Hitler”
salute.

Third, if you think the choles-
terol level in American fast food is
high, don’t complain. A typical
sandwich in Merry Old England
consists of a tube of mayonnaise,
maybe a little pork fat, and couple

sticks of butter — all wrapped up
in a poppy seed roll. You can
actually see yourself getting fatter
as you eat.

Fourth, while in France, bring-
ing up the French military achieve-
ments during the twentieth century
is not a good move in polite con-
versation. They are not all that
fond of Americans as it is; if you
aggravate them by mentioning how
they got their butts completely
kicked in both world wars they
might be forced to thrash you with
a beret or something.

Fifth, don’t ever, ever refer to
an Irishman as British. The people
in Ireland spend all their time sit-

ting around drinking Guiness, sing--

ing really loud songs, and talking

about how they beat the English in —

soccer back in about 1800. They

are generally nice, easygoing
people, but if you confuse them

with the English they may throw

you in Dublin River, undoubtedly
the foulest body of water I have
ever seen (I think they bottle it
directly with a touch of motor oil to

make Guiness, but don’t quote me’

on that).
Sixth, jogging is nota big sport

‘in Europe. The concept of exer-

cise hasn’t quite hit a lot of places.
If you are running down the street
people are likely to pull over and
ask you if you need a ride some-
where. As a matter of fact, that
actually happened to my room-
mate a few times during his morn-
ing jogs in Germany. He claims
these friendly German motorists
were trying to hit on him, but judg-
ing by his physique I’m guessing

they just weren’t familiar with the
activity of jogging.

And last, don’t go to the “Ba-
nana Bar” in Amsterdam looking
to purchase fresh produce.
Amsterdam defines the word
“sketchy,” and lots of very seedy
things go on there. From what I
noticed, just about everything you
could think of is legal there, which
is good and bad. Anything goes,
which is also good and bad. It’s
interesting, but definitely not a
place most sane humans can stand
for more than about 48 hours.
Avoid the town entirely if youdon’t
like Heineken, it’s quite popular
there.

Well, that’s about it. If You
remember this lesson you may
avoid serious embarrassment, but
then again, where’s the fun in that?
