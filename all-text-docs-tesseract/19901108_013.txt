Braitman Employs Rich Colors
And Images In His Paintings

Change in process and style
are apparent in Andrew Braitman’s
mostrecent paintings. The crusty,
sculptural qualities have expanded
to include scraping andcutting into
dried layers of paini instead of
only wet paint.

These highly textured surfaces
capture more light than before in a
wet luminescence.

Discarding the old diamond
motif, Braitman now spends more
time planning outcontent--as much
as three days on preliminary
sketches.

In doing so, he adds a mytho-
logical elementto previously deco-
rative works.

Braitman pushes the edge
between system and non-system
through gesture within carefully
devised geometric shapes.

Layer after layer of oil paint
mixed with finely ground volcanic
pumice. is applied, then scraped
off, gauged into, and sliced through.

This process creates an arche-
ological effect similar to that of
Antoni Tapies whose relief paint-
ing demonstrated a collapsing of
sculpture and painting into one
united medium.

Braitman further pushes that
edge in the actual forms--juxta-
posing curves and smeared edges
with straight, formal lines. Colors
are rich, muted shades of coral,
brown, purple, gold, and green.

The overall effect is one of
forms and colors moving in and
out of consciousness.

Braitman’s central images are
framed within the paintings them-
selves.

In works where the forms are
morecurvaceous,Tectonic Vignette
I & Ill, the background is more an
extension of the interior forms than
an actual frame. °

Are -youbored with your ward-

robe? Does your, Trocadero seem.
truculent, your Esprit uninspiring?

Or perhaps | you looked in the
mirror today and realized for the
first time that low-top duckboots
are the most lame-brained idea
fashionable footwear’s seen since
the jelly.

- Well; there are alternatives.’
Recent magazines have noticed the
trend from cookie cutter fashions
(multiples?) to a more personal
style.

Instead of returning to the Gap,
people are rummaging through
used clothing stores and discover-
ing fashion long-forgotten. More-

strange merchandise; the store is

very, clean, in appearance, with:
-shiny aluminum racks and fluores-

cent lighting. Their prices reflect
it.

Rainbow Baigain’ Center:
Incredible. This shop is located
right next to Infinity’s, and it just
opened a month ago. If you want
an accessory shop, thisisit.

They’ve got hats, belts, bags,
bandannas, scarves, earrings, and
other really nifty stuff.

It’s also very cheap. I picked
up a black beret for $3, and the
highest priced item I could find
was a leather policeman’s hat for
$19.99. It’s a small shop, with a

classified by theirdress. They want.

to experiment.

Charlotte can satiate this need.
- Besides spetialty shops (Dead-
head, Metal, Alternative), the

Queen city reveals some more:

gerieral hunting grounds.

All you need to know is where
to look. To make shopping easier,
I’ve pinpointed a number of stores
that lieclose toeachother.

Infinity's End. The Grand-
Daddy of Genre clothing, and the
most well known by Davidson
students. On one side of the store:
lies enough Grateful Dead to choke
Garcia himself, from. Baja jackets
to tie-dye T-shirts, sepas to in-
cense,

They also have a pipe collec-
tion across the back wall that would
make even ‘Dave Crosby look
again.

The other side is pee with
Metalhead gear, ranging from

wear, ; '
You mightthink this place har
bored true miscreants, Despite its

actual frames are painted around
the central images.

These framesconsistof stacked
rectangles that contrast in form as
wellas in color, thus activating the
space and becoming an integral
part of the paintings.

Although there are no figura-
tive images in the seventeen works
exhibited, the titlesserve as frames
of reference that lend a suggestion
of narrative tothe decorative paint-
ings.

In the Marlowe's Tempest
series and Duplicity in the Storm,
the darkest and most built-up
works, titles combined with tex-
tures and gesture create an image
of torrents of water and mud wash-
ing across a once smooth surface.

Non-figurative blotches of
paint become splatting raindrops
and tormented leaves.

These connectionscan be made
in most of Braitman’s paintings,
thus drawing the viewer in as an
active participant in determining
the artist’s meanings and inten-
tions.

Price range: $750 to $4000.

closest thing Charlotte has to a
Bohemian district.

The floors are: mostly dark

wood or dark carpet, and the cloth-
ing is arranged in different rooms
throughout.

Theclients are generally of the
young alternative crowd, the type
that liked Depeche Mode when
Depeche Mode wasn’t cool. Sev-
enth Street seems particularly fo-
cussed towards their type of fash-
ion, but it has some eccentricities
as well.

To get to it, take the Independ-
ence Boulevard exit off of Brook-
shire, but turn right onto the Plaza
instead of travelling down to K-

stocky Oriental man behind the ~Mart- Turn-right at the-stop sign;

counter. I highly recommend it.
‘Morris Army-Navy Surplus
Store. Army-Navy stores are great
places to go shopping. They also
have hats and bandannas, as well
as belt buckles, shoe strings, and
camouflage gear. It is also very
clean, though it smells slightly of
bootrubber.

All three of these shops are
located in the K-Mart shopping
centeron Independence Boulevard.
You need only take I-77 to Brook-
shire West, then exit left onto Inde-
pendence Boulevard and follow it

until you seeiton yourright (about —

three or four miles).

These shops are relatively
conventional. They are brightly
lit, the clothes are on racks, and the
clerks dress in ordinary attire.

But if you travel deeper into
Charlotte, you can find some re-
ally weird places, with stranger
merchandise and much lower

Street Em-

turn left at the intersection, then
follow the road to across some
railroad tracks to Monroe.

Turn right on Monroe, and the
shop will be on your left. If you hit
Hawthorne Lane, you’ ve gone too
far.

Lastly, there is one more place
every fashion scavenger needs to
check out. Your local Salvation
Army Thrift Store has the best
clothes at the best prices.

All styles of outdated clothing
wind up here, with vests starting at

~ $1.50 each anda sportscoat selling
‘for $7. To find it, take the More-

head exitoff of 1-77 (exit 10a), turn
left, follow it until you hit Kings,
and turn left.

Follow Kings past Central
Piedmont Community College and
youare now on Central. The Thrift
Store will be on your left. If you
see a Harris Teeter on the right
you’ ve gone too far.

Gallery Crawling In
Charotte Lets Students
Meet Different Artists

By MISSY MEEGAN

On the first Friday of every
month art galleries in downtown
Charlotte open their doors an extra
few hours to allow public access to
the new exhibitions.

The “Gallery Crawl’ lets
people walk from gallery to gal-
lery to see the latest shows. Last
Friday the Union Gallery Commit-
tee sponsored a trip to the crawl by
taking two van loads to Charlotte.

The crawl starts in Spirit
Square, one of the best centers in
North Carolina to view nationally
renowned works.

Spirit Square houses several’

galleries whose shows included
The Rosenberg Exhibition, andex-
hibitions concerning the oppres-
sion in Palestine and the after ef-
fects of the Viet Nam war.

Other galleries included in the
crawl are the Jared Melbourne
Gallery, the Hodges Taylor Gal-
lery and the Center of the Earth

” is a
direct result of his family’s troub-
les in Yugoslavia. Theseare “films
about the difficulty of seeing
through our own ideological, sex-
ual, political, economic, racial,
ethnic... blinders.”

The categories entitled “Hor-
rifying” and “Strangely Comfort-
ing” exist as gut-feelings he felt
after watching the categories’

Gallery. Several of the artists are at
their shows andsoften talk to the
public.

Of course, aside from the ex-
cellent opportunity to absorb the
wide variety of artistic culture, the
Gallery Crawl is quite a social
event. Students who went com-
mented not only on the art, but also
onthe people they saw and conver-
sations they heard.

Professor Shaw Smith was re-
ported to be seen emerging from a
white limousine in his distinguish-
able leather jacket and cowboy
boots.

Since the first trip proved suc-
cessful, the Gallery Committee will
continue this event on the first
Friday of every month.

If interested, the next crawl is
Friday, Dec. 7.

Please sign up at the Union’s
Information Desk the week before
to insure a ride to Charlotte. We
will meetin the Conversation Pitat
5:30 P.M. on Friday, Dec. 7.

films. The “horrifying” films are
those films concerning 'man and
women who cannot love and un-
derstand themselves. ‘Strangely
Comforting’ films remind the
viewer that perhaps “you are look-
ing in the right direction.”

The “nostalgic” category then
“reminds us that we are perpetu-
ally coming of age.”

Finally, the categories of
“Historical (External Pressure of
Us)”, and “Psychological (Inter-
nal Pressure of Us)” address the
existence of films in accordance to
historical or psychological human
events.
