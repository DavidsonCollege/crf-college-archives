Spongetones, Bongos, Nashvillians In Roundup

By STEVE MANK

Hey kids, albums have hit another
lull. Seems as though Christmas is just
too far back and summer’s too far
away, SO once again, it’s time for
another E.P. round-up in which those
dandy little five-song discs, too often
overlooked, are reviewed.

Torn Apart
The Spongetones’ E. P., Torn Apart is
an excellent follow-up to the band’s
highly touted debut L. P., Beat Music.

homecoming concert, but here the
band sounds far better thanks to the
wonders of studio magic.

The group is an unadulterated copy
of the Beatles, but surprisingly, this
does not work against them. On the
contrary, the Spongetones have just as
much energy as their mentors and
come frighteningly close to being al-
most as good. Every now and then one
would swear the combo could make a
fortune by claiming to find long-lost
Beatles tunes.

One of the most noteworthy tracks
is “Shock Therapy,” which sends the
mind reeling with its flanged vocals,
pounding drums, and bizzare guitar
solos. Incidently, if that clapping on
“Shock Therapy” sounds familiar, it
should: that’s the always helpful
R. E. M. offering their services on yet
another album by an up-and-coming
local band.

Numbers With Wings:

Numbers With Wings, by the Bon-
gos, was released last year and is one
of the band’s better efforts to date. The
title track epitomizes the band’s
nouvo-dance/psycedelia and is, in

fact, so good that it inevitably warrants
a second playing.

“Sweet Blue Cage” is also very
good, with its almost contemplative
acoustic guitars acting as a lilting
backdrop to the biting electrics. (By
the way, the band does in fact use bon-
gos which is kind of noteworthy, that
being their name.)

The Young Nashvillians

This disc is from a band up Tennes-
see way called The Young Nashvil-
lians. The E. P., cleverly titled The
Young Nashvillians Are Here is a very
sundry collection of sometimes whim-

sical songs that reflects a side of the
human pyche that many of us are afraid
to admit exists.

Of special note is “Amelia,” about
that famous pilot who “flying cross the
ocean/ she got a notion that something
had gone wrong,” and “Eagle Man,”
the story of one “bodacious beast.”

But the main reason for purchasing
The Young Nashvillians Are Here is
that The Young Nashvillians don’t

spread their songs out. Rather, they
put ’em all on one side and, to the satis-
faction of innumerable fans, sign the
other.
