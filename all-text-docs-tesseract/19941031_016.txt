the secrets behind her best-seller
novels.

. She was not what I was expecting.
I took a glance to my left as I
approached the front of the Guest
House. Isawa shiny blacklimou-
sine with a large chauffeur stand-
ing silently to its side (later I was
to find out that the chauffeur was
an ex-Navy Seal). Walking up the

‘steps, [could feel the sharp-edged
note cards in my pockets on which
I had scribbled my questions for
Ms. Cornwell. I took each step
slowly, collecting my thoughts and

straightening my belt. I had met
her once before, but the aura ofa
bestselling, award- winning au-
thor had not hit me that time me
like it did at this moment. Going to
talk to a big shot mystery author
with five critically acclaimed nov-
els, a long black car, and a chauf-
feur made of steel was enough to
intimidate me out of my socks.

Once I was inthe the Guest House ~

I again had a chance to let my
imagination take control of my
rational thoughts. I just knew she
was going to come striding in the
lounge witha feather wrap draped
around her neck and with a long,
black cigarette holder wedged
between her fingers like a charac-
ter froman Agatha Christie novel.
My ridiculous assumptions
couldn’t have been more wrong.
Her wonderful, down-to-earth at-
titude and straightforward per-
sonality hit me almost immedi-
ately and called to attention what
asilly stereotype I had made. As I
talked with her, I realized how
much she had to say about her
novels and life in general, and
how much I had to learn from
her.

Why did you choose the mys-
tery writing genre and specifically
mystery writing about serial mur-
derers?

- [have never read mysteries,
arid interestingly enough, I do not
call what I write mysteries, be-
cause those tend to be more for-
mula-oriented books that adhere to
conventions of a very old genre.
It’s like doing a Rubik’s cube. I
tend to be more of a nonfiction
writer who simply tells a story that
reflects what I see going on outside
my window.

I know that you wrote three
books which went unpublished
before Postmortem was published
in 1990. I’m sure after writing
three books which were turned
down you were pretty frustrated.
Where did your energy and drive
to keep writing come from? What

ystery
writer and ‘79 graduate
Patricia Cornwell uncovers

~ way to explore that interior world

kept you going?

The same thing that keeps me
goirig now: I have a passion for
writing. There is just nothing I
would rather do. I love it so much
that if Icouldn’t doit anymore, I’m
not sure I would want to be here
anymore. It’s where I find myself.
It’s the world where I’m happiest.
It’s my interior world. I have no

unless I do it though writing. For
some people it would be music or
painting, but for me itis words. So

riting is not a job or even a
hobby. It is at relationship. -

I couldn’t quit. I don’t know how
to quit. I tell you what itis like, and
I’ve said this many times to people.
They look at me like it is a very odd
thing. Writing is not a job or even
a hobby. It is a relationship. What
Ido isa relationship. It’s not work.
Many times it is quite odious, and
hideous, and aggravating. We don’t
get along, and sometimes we de-
cide we’re going to split up, but of
course we never do.

What do you find to be diffi-
cult about your relationships with
your characters and your writ-
ing?

We both get tired. They do
what they want to do and they
don’t listen to me. That’s for cer-
tain. It takes a lot of energy. It’s
very hard work. It’s like any rela-
tionship. In order to make it work,
it takes a lot of energy and writing
takes as much energy. I’m ex-
hausted when I finish a book.

In your new book, The Body
Farm, you incorporate many
mother/daughter relationships,
some of which are negligent, de-
structive, and even deadly. Is there
areason why that theme came out
in your book?

There is nothing worse than a
maternal figure who is evil, be-
cause evil is all about people tak-
ing power over others who have no
power. Nothing is more powerless
than achildin the hands ofa mother
or a father who is aberrant in some
way. I think that for me, my most
horrifying experiences when I was
a little kid were really at the hands
of a foster mother who was cruel. I
wasn’t around my father, so that
was an absence that was very pain-

ful, but at least he wasn’t there
being cruel. There may be some of
that [in the book], but I think that
the whole parent child situation is
SO ... it just breaks my heart when
you think of a child. that has no
power being tormented and no-
body knows it.

I know you have aclose very
connection with your main char-
acter, Kay Scarpetta, through the
first person narrative of your writ-
ing. Iwas just wondering how you
arrived at writing your books in
first person opposed to third per-
son.

I experimented with all those
voices when I first began these
novels, and they all felt awkward.
The first person for some reason
was what it was telling me to do. It
was pulling me into taking on the
persona of this character (Kay
Scarpetta) because I thought what
was most important was for me to
write about what it feels like to be
her. If I didn’t do it in first person,
I would have to show alot of things
that I really don’t want to show. I
don’t want to show crimes hap-
pening like in Postmortem. 1 don’t
want to show those women being
strangled. I don’t want to show the
killer unless Scarpetta happens to
see him for some reason. I feel safe
being with her, but it is a very
unsafe world to be away from her.

I don’t want to leave her shoes.

I found when Iread The Body
Farm your characters seemed to
develop even more dynamically
and realistically than in the previ-
ous novels. Was this a conscious
change, or did it just happen that
way?

I think it is just a natural evo-
lution that with each book I know
them better and I’m more inter-
ested in who they are. They’ re get-
ting older and changing. When you
have a series, it is inevitable that
with each book your characters
have reached another stage in their
own lives. You have to address
that, so I have to let them tell me
where they are in their lives and
what is going on with them. I get
surprised. Ididn’t plan for Scarpetta
to have an affair. She did that right

when I was standing there. I told
her not to, but she wouldn’t listen.

to me. I didn’t know Lucy was
going to be gay. They just tell me
what they are and I just report on it.
With each book it evolves more
and more. It is really a very intui-
tive process.

I find your books very fright-
ening at times. I was wondering if
you ever get scared by your own
books.

Not really, but I will say that
there are times like when I was
working on the whole business of
the little girl. I couldn’t write at
night when I was doing that. When
I was doing Cruel and Unusual
and was dealing with Eddie Heath
and his body against the dumpster,
I couldn’t write at night. I would
just get really scared. I though I
was just being scared because the
house was creaking, but it. was
really because it was disturbing
me on a deep level. This is very
real to me. I’ ve seen cases like this.
In fact, I don’t write at night much
at all anymore unless I feel very
safe somewhere like in a hotel. I
really can’t, because I get scared.

As I walked out of the Guest
House with my Body Farm T-
shirt (a novel souvenir) in hand, I
knew that having a chance to talk
one-on-one with Patricia
Cornwell was quite an unusual
and fascinating experience. As
gripping and fascinating as her
novels are, she isasaperson. She
has let her characters lead her
through her writing and has kept
her feet on the ground in determi-
nation, both of which can be at-
tested by her success as a multi
award-winning novels.
