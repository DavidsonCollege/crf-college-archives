Juniors Commit To Challenge

Of New Life In Montpellier

By BILL GIDUZ
Staff Writer

It pays off in two ways. It isa
very personal thing to make
French friends and find your-
self gradually overcoming the
formidable language barrier.
You find yourself slowly
becoming a part of the French
society, a welcome feeling after
quite a few early homesick days
when the whole situation
seemed rather hopeless.

It is a process of integration
that has to be worked at,
though. Contrary to what many
people may think, it is possible
to come to Montpellier and not
learn French or meet the Fren-

ch people.

There are a couple of hundred
Americans here and it is quite
possible to associate with them
most of the time. And, in a land
where even simple con-
versations are difficult at first,
it is occasionally a very temp-
ting thing to do.

The French seldom go far
out of their way to meet and
associate with Americans,
although they do turn out to be
good friends once the prover-
bial ice has been broken.

Lewis Rogers and Raymond
Grubb were invited to spend the
weekend with a French family
they had met, and it proved to
be a culinary orgy.

Various ways of meeting the
French have been tried, but one
of the best remains a Frisbee,
Most Frenchmen, and more
Europeans in general, have
never seen this toy that is so
taken for granted on U.S. cam-
puses, and toddlers and old
men alike are fascinated with
it.

Manning Hudson, Scoot Dimon
and Eric Vernon were in Mont-
pellier’s main promenade one
Sunday afternoon. Manning
came back with a young blonde
schoolteacher from Normandy.
Scoot and Eric came back with
just the Frisbee, but they were
out throwing and hoping for
better luck the next afternoon.

On a different level, JYA-
France is an opportunity to
travel and finally see things
that all your neighbors show
you endless slides of every sum-
mer. But you have no real
schedule or time limit, (other
than the two month validity of
the magic Studentrail Pass) you
can practically go whenever

and wherever you want.

It takes a lot of responsibility
and self-discipline to do, also
because there are nine courses
that have to go along with the
miles of countryside and city
streets. But ask any of the 14,
being on your own in Europe
holds a million joys and sur-
prises.

Most of the study is_ in-
dependent and flexible. as it
should be for the reasons cited
above, but no one should think
that you can come to France
and get credit for traveling
around Europe, because you
can't. None of this is to claim we
will never return to Europe,
because most of us probably
will.

But wewillneveragainbeable
to wander the continent with
only a backpack, Studentrail
pass and guidebook to Youth
Hostels. And next time we go to
Zermatt, it will probably be ex-
pressly to see the Matterhorn.

We won't be able to ex-
perience that ecstatic surprise
and we won't be able to linger
and gaze and climb the hills
because the tourist bus will only
stay for two hours.

... Senate To Examine Publications

(Continued From Page |)

“The Wildcat Handbook is the
first contact a freshman has
with Davidson, and the pictures
help you get to know people,”
Levi pointed out. ‘Besides,
there’s lots of valuable in-
formation—places to go, maps.”

“The yearbook isn't jus
something to look through,”
George said. ‘‘It's a history tha
will remain, a way to go back
and find out all you need to
know about a year at David-

He said he plans a few
changes from the present for-
mat of the yearbook.

“TI hope to have more com-
plete coverage of things, with a
caption on every picture, and
some changes in layout,"
George explained. ‘‘It needs to
be more unified.”

Levi said that the handbook
“always changes a little, but for

anything major, we may have
Problems with money.”

Ron Conoley, who has edited
the yearbook the past two
years, said that he definitely
thought it should be continued
and that he would be satisfied if
the publication was financed at
its present level ($8,000).

‘‘But if funds could be raised
substantially, it would be
possible to expand coverage in
certain sections and to have a
lot more color,’’ Conoley added.

Of the 698 students respon-
ding to the questionnaire
(which was included on the
ballot of Tuesday's election).
86.5 percent agreed that David-
son should have a yearbook.

Those who approved con-
tinuing the publication were
asked how much money it
should be budgeted. Only five
percent wanted to see the Quips
& Cranks funds cut to $4,000. 32

Mexico Program Begun

By ALAN FORD
Staff Reporter

Davidson will sponsor a new
foreign study program in two
Mexican cities during the
second session of summer
school this year.

Two weeks of the course will
be spent in Mexico City with the
third and final week being spent
in Tampico, a city of about
300,000 on the Gulf of Mexico.
The course will be directed by
Lois Kemp, chairman of the
Spanish Department. She will
be assisted by Carlos Sanchez-
Rendon, a Davidson senior
from Tampico.

“The most important aspect
of the program is that the
students will be living with host
families, as a member of the
family,’’ Kemp said. The
students will have two host
families, one in both Mexico

Sanchez added that the
primary objective of the
program is ‘to do away with
some of the. fallacies that
Americans hold about Mexico.”’

The course is open to David-
son undergraduates and North
Carolina Spanish teachers. The

estimated cost of the course is
$670, which includes air fare,
room and board, and tuition,
$590; fee for group expenses,
$20; books, newspapers,
Magazines, bus and subway
transportation, entrance fees to
museums, theaters, concerts
(each student paying his own
way), $60.

percent would have the figure
remain the same as this year--
$8,000, and 63 percent suggested
that it be expanded to $10,000,
the level before 1972.

However, 46.8 percent of
those answering the poll said
that they would buy a small,
inexpensive yearbook which
was not funded by the SGA.

On the questions pertaining to
the Wildcat Handbook, 92 per-
cent of the respondees favored
the present form over a book
with only pictures, and 96.4 per-
cent said that the publication
should continue to be handled
by students‘rather than the Ad-
ministration.

It was suggested by 77.1 per-
cent of the students voting that
the handbook be distributed to
all students rather than only
freshmen.
