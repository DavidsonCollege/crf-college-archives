Court Reverses
Drug Conviction

In a dramatic and unpre-
cedented move, the David-
son College Court of  Ap-
reversed itself this
week and suspended — the
sentence of a Davidson stu
dent. who had been found
guilty of selling . hallucina-
tory drugs.

The student had
found guilty of the charge
by the college Regulations
Court during the fall term
exam period.

peals

been

His first appeal to the col-
lege Court of Appeals failed
to overturn the conviction or
the sentence of two-years’
suspension from school.

The defendent then press
ed his appeal to the David-
son College, Board of Trus
tees.

The board did not take up
the appeal at its Feb. 3-4
meeting because;of its heavy
schedule, according to Dean
of Students Richard C.
Burts Jr.

During the time that the
appeal to the trustees was
pending, the student with-
drew his appeal.

Instead, at the request of
the defendant, the College
agreed to offer a retrial.

The defendent asked that
he not be retired by_the Re-
gulations Court, since he
felt he could not get a ‘‘fair
trial’ in that court. So the

retrial was handled by the
Court of Appeals.

The second Appeals Court
verdict found the student
guilty as charged, but it
suspended his sentence of
two years’ suspension from
school, said Burts.-

The unprecedented request
Yor a retrial was accepted
because, according to Burts,
the defendent had “changed
his own outlook.”

Burts explained that the
defendent had put up only
a ‘‘passive’’ defense in the
first trials, but then indicat-
ed a desire to take an active

part in his own defense. #4

The college Court of Ap
peals was somewhat ill at
ease because
one year old
procedures had _ not
settled.

According to Burts, out-
side legal advice told the
Appeals Court that it could
act either as an appelate
court, as it had before, or
retry the case.

In an interview this week,
Burts spoke on some of the
issues which have surround-
ed the current drugs case.

He stated that the. College
will “continue to enforce its
own regulations’ concern-
ing use of potentially harm
ful drugs.

He said that the question
of whether to let the police
force of the state of North
Carolina jurisdiction
over instances of alleged
campus drug use was not
at present under specific re-
view by college officials.

It is, however, a
question,”’ which is liable to
“basic review’ by the ad
ministration,

Burney Letter To Burts Hits
Alleged Invasion Of Privacy

SGA Vice President Cecil
Burney has released to the
Residence Hall Council an
open letter to Dean of, Stu-
dents Richard C. Burts Jr.
in which he calls for an end
to alleged’ invasion of stu-
dents’ privacy by college per-
sonnel.

The letter says, in part,
that. Burney has “become
increasingly aware .. . of
student complaints about
college personnel roaming
through the residence halls,
opening locked doors of stu-
dent rooms at various hours
of the day and night.

“Many ... students...
suspect that someone in the
college administration is
conducting a search for vicla-

tions of the open dorm regu-
lations and Code Responsi-
bility violations,

oA as President of the
Residence Hall Association,
I want to make it clear to
you that you and other-col-
lege personnel are not wel-
come in the residence halls
for purposes of search with-
out a written search warrant
in hand.”

Burney was elected with-
out opposition» to the joint
post of SGA vice president
and RHC president last Jan.
20.

In an interview, he explain-
ed that faculty and person-
nel are welcome in the dorms
during periods of open house.
This is an “automatic  in-

vitation,” written into the
RHC Mannual of Order.
Burney said that his letter
was intended to discourage
college personnel from dis-

turbing students’ privacy
while they are entertaining
guests,

In the RHC meeting Mon-
day night, council members
seemed to agree that some
principle of privacy should
be made explicit~to the ad-
ministration.

Several members felt that
college personnel should be
required to have written
search warrants before open-
ing any student’s locked

it, acceptance by three di-

with so

He stated that many rules
today are unrealistic, parti-
cularly in light of the change
inthe, moral climate.

Part of the problem lies
in the fact that the student
responsibility of self-polic
ing is just not working.”

Violations concerning the
misuse of drugs or the open
dorm priviliges are not be
ing reported.

One of the chief areas of
ambiguity is in defining the
position of the Code on the
basis for issuance of search
warrants. The Code does not
specify the limitation of such
a warrant and members of
the court, itself, are unclear
on the subject.

Also, the responsibilities
of maintenance officials who
have access to all rooms is
not clearly specified. |

The legal responsibility of
the court in drug: abuse still
seems to be an open issue.

In the past, civil authori-
ties have generally main-

tained that colleges have the
right to handle their pro
blems in their own manner,
provided that the rules were
clearly defined and that in
dividuals treated

were

cess,

Recently, civil courts seem
to have entered a transition
period in which the —em-
phasis is being placed in the
other direction.

Roberts said that hopes of
success lie in the leveling of
responsibility on the stu-
dents, themselves.

He stated; “You can't get
anywhere trying to legislate
morals."

There is no definite stance
on punishments prescribed
by the court. According to
the court members,
case is tried on its own mer-
its.

First a decision of guilty
or not is made. Then the
individual situation is an-
alyzed to reach a_ suitable
solution.

When the trustees meet in
April, they may approve the
Code on a _ permanent or
tentative basis.

Roberts said that it was
his hope to have it approv-
ed in principle, leaving the
court free to iron out the
details of the individual pro-
blems as they crop up.

The meeting held (in
Belk dorm lobby this week
was rather poorly attended.
Only one student showed up
to question the court. and
only two members of the
court were there to defend
it.
