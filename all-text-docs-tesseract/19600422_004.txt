DOUG HOUCHENS TEACHES

Davidson's
explained

Doug Houchens,
only art professor,

that this was the Basic Studio

class, “It is part of Davidson's
art program which also includes
an art history course and an

jadvanced studio course in gra-

phics.”

This program has developed
in. the last few years from one
art course which was a combi-
nation of art history and studio.
“A lot of people took it, but
they didn't learn much about
art history or art technique. So
we split up the courses,” said
Houchens.

“Ever since then the studio
class has been small, but stead-
ily growing. I'm not sure why
more people don’t take studio.
There’s not much time for it, T
know. And then, too, anybody
who is really interested in art
wouldn't come to Davidson be-
cause we have such a small
department here.”

GRADES AND ENROLLMENT

Houchens stopped and pon-
dered for a long time and then
said, “But, I think that it's
more than that. Davidson has a
fine academic.rating which calls
for competition among students.
This results in high grade con-
sciousness. Many boys with high
averages might be afraid to risk
their high standing on an un-

DAVIDSON CALLS

“I got a notice for just such
a position here at Davidson. I
applied and was hired.”

Mr. Houchens will take a
sabbatical from Davidson next
year. He will spend much time
building up an expanding col-
lection of color slides. These

“Studio is a very difficult
thing to grade. I try to consider
the student’s progress more
than his native ability when
formulating his grade. Of
course, there has to be some
academic work, and I give tests
on some of the basic informa.
tion about design, color, paint,
and so forth, that the students
should assimilate.

INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT

much as possible around the in-

One student observed that all
the candidates had made state-
ments on education. “Do you
think you will do more with the
question of education than any
other candidate if you are elect-
ed?” he asked.

TOTAL EMPHASIS

“I am the only candidate who
has put his total emphasis on

“education,” came Sanford's re-

ply. “I know Tll do more with
this problem than any other
candidate. My job is to com-
municate this to you.”

In the Presidential race, Mr.
Sanford tossed his support to
Lyndon Johnson of Texas. “The
biggest thing facing the next
President will be foreign rela-
tions. I believe that Jobnson is
the most capable man to handle
this.” When someone suggested
that the Texan was no more
than a schemer, Mr. Sanford
displayed a big grin. “That's
just it! I want a good schemer
on our side.”

Sanford re-
plied that “no one knows how

Masquers Present
Dramatic Reading

The Red and Black Masquers
of Davidson College will pre-
sent a reading of Stephen Vin-
cent Benet’s John Brown’s Body
at the College Union on Wed-
nesday, May 18.

Stephen Vincent Benet (1898-
1043), New England poet and
novelist, wrote this verse narra-
tive of the Civil War in 1928
and named it after the John
Brown of Harper's Ferry fame.
After winning the Pulitzer Prize
in 1929, the poem rapidly gain-
ed its present status as an
American epic.

The poem begins with a pre
lude entitled ‘The Slaver’
sketching early intersectional
antagonism and giving an ac-
count of an early slave-trader,
Captain Ball, and his conscious-
stricken mate. The poem moves
to the famous story of the raid
an Harper's Ferry led by John
Brown, of Brown’s capture, and
of his being hanged.

Then Benet tells the story of
the opening days of the War
with brief episodes in the lives
of Lincoln, Davis, Lee, Jackson,
Grant and other outstanding
figures. The interrupted story
of the protagonists is picked up
here.

There will be three principal
readers: an older man will be
portrayed by Malcolm Murchi-
son; ‘Bill Haggen will be a
younger man; and Jeanne Chat-
man of Queens College will play
the female role. Students are
j now being selected for the mod-
ern Greek chorus which will
represent one of the characters.
