ORCHID, OUTING, SET TICKETS
WILL GRACE FROLICS QUEEN

The Davidsonian—Pan Hellenic Council Spring Frolies’ beau-
ty contest is nearing its deadline. Our three judges, Professors
MeGavock, Boyd, and Davidson are soon to meet and select the
winner. Our first Spring Frolics’ beauty queen will be crowned

by the President of the Student Body, Whit Cobb, and presented

during the Pan Hellenic figure the
night of the formal dance.

In addition the Davidsonian is
presenting the winner with an or-
chid corsage, dinner for: her and
her date at Chez Montet, and tick-
ets to the dance set. It is hoped
that the student body will be in-
terested in the contest to the ex-
tent that this feature of Spring
Frolics’ wilt be established as a
traditional part of our Spring
dances. If such is the case, students
in the future may look forward to
the final dance set with even more
interest and anticipation than is
now felt.

In keeping with the beauty of.
these particular dances, a beauty
queen representing the students’
dates, should add to The enjoyment
of the week end for all,

All entries submitted must be
on behalf of girls who will attend
the dances. All pictures will be re-
turned to men submitting them af-
ter the judges decision. Turn in
entries to Bill King, 15 Georgia, be-
fore April 16th.

YMCA Serves Needs
Of Negro Community

This division of the College “Y”
is more particularly concerned with
the Colored Community of — the
Town of Davidson.

In the colored community the
YMCA carried on a three-fold pro-
gram in its efforts to be a definite
Christian influence among the peo.
ple. The students of the College
give their time and efforts to the
forwarding of such causes as teach-
ing Sunday school classes directing
the playground activity of the col-
ored children, and the showing of
educational movies.

The splendid cooperation of some
twenty members of the student
body during the school year has
made it possibe for the “Y" to
furnish supervisors for the play-
grounds each day Monday through
Friday from 3:30 to 5:30 p. m. It
is under the direction of these boys
that the children of the community
enjoy the full circuit of sports from
football to basketball to softball
and back to football.. The basic
equipment for the sports participat-
ed in during the various seasons
is furnished by the “Y.”

Thero ie quite a group cf etu
dents on the Sunday school teach.
ing staff for the community. These
men are ready, when needed, to
take part in teaching Sunday
school classes for the three differ-
ent colored churches of Davidson,
In former years this was one of
our fields of greater activity but
for the past few years we had lim-
ited demands in this area due to
the fact that it was only a matter
of time before the churches had
developed trained teachers, Despite
the fact that the churches are ful-
ly staffed, the College YMCA stands
every ready to extend this hand of
Christian service.

A great favorite with the folks of
the community is the weekly mo-
vies which are shown each Tues-
day night at 7:30. This is one phase
of the “Y” program which is par.
ticipated in and enjoyed by ail
ages. This is made possible because
of the gracious aid rendered by the
Film and Sound Division of the
Public Library of Charlotte and
Mecklenburg County. All film are
catalogued according to age, school
grade, interest, and subject matter
in detail. Not only are these mo-
vies the best in audio-visual educa- |

| tion, but they have proven highly

delightful as well and have been

“THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER" FEATURES
“THESENATOR,” “DADDY ERWIN", “MRS.DUTCH"

Monty. Wooley was the first.
Since then the number has become
legion,

And you can add another to the
ever increasing number of “Men”
who came to dinner when Bill Trot-
man assumes the Falstaffian role
of Sheridan Whitesides in the Red
and Black Masquers Spring produc-
tion.

The Masquers will give “The
Man Who Came to Dinner” in
Chambers Auditorium on a date
tentatively set as May 5.

With the announcement of Trot-
man as lead also came the selec-
tion of approximately twenty per-
sons in supporting roles. It will be
one of the largest casts assembled
here in several years and Director
Nancy Copeland believes it to be
one of the most experienced.

Besides Trotman, who has es-
tablished himself as an accomplish-
ed actor by his performance in
“John Loves Mary” and his direct-

ing of the two one-act plays ear-
lier this season, Miss Copeland an-
nounced that Prof. E. J. Erwin
and Mrs, Ruth Hengeveld would
also take important parts, as Dr.
Bradley and Mrs. Stanley, respec-
tively,

Both Mr. Erwin and Mrs. Henge-
veld took active roles when the
“Man” first came to dinner on the
Davidson campus back in 1942, and
Shaw Smith portrayed the initim-
able Mr. Whitesides. Prior to that

time, Mrs, Hengeveld had been a
consistent participant in Masquer
productions. Prof. Erwin is also
the group's faculty adviser.

Playing opposite Mrs. Hengeveld
will be Bill Pharr, the warden of
“The Valiant” fame, as Mr. Stan.

‘ley. Together they form the dis-

traught: hosts whose home'is turn-
ed into a madhouse by the bewhis-
kered Whitesides.

The entire cast of “Sunday Costs
Five Pesos” will be back in action

again, Dorothy Herring will have
the eery difficult role of Maggie
Cutler, secretary to Whitesides;
Mary Wells McNeil will be seen
as Miss Pern, the nurse; Jesse Car-
ter as June Stanley, Mae Holly
as Harriet Stanley, and Wylie
Smith as Banjo.

Others in the cast include Tad
Currie, Bob Hotchkiss, Carter Pat-
terson, Nancy Adams, Bitl Hollis.
ter, Vance Mizelle, Phil Davis,
Howard Ferguson, Ellen Thigpen,
and Howard Proctor.

The play as originally produced
on Broadway in 1936 was a take-
off on the pomposity of certain

notables of that day, notably Alex-| §

ander Woolcott, Noel Coward, and
Gertrude Lawrence. After a long
run success on the Great White
Way, it was made into a very suc
cessful movie. Monty Wooley star-
red in both versions. Alexander
Woolcott, himself, once took the
role of Whitesides while the show
was on the road.

Body President

Randy Taylor (above), Junior, from Milledgeville, Georgia, was
elected President of the Student Body this afternoon, defeating
Auburn Lambeth, Junior, from Decatur, Georgia, in the final ballot-
ing. Randy is also a member of the YMCA Cabinet, the Kappa
Sigma fraternity, and several other campus organizations.

news that the Charlotte orchestra
was under contract for the dance.
Knauff has gained the reputation
of being one of the best orchestras
in the Carolinas and is said to be
catching the eye of the entire East-
ern seaboard with his superior pre-
sentations of popular dancing mu-
sic. The Knauff instrumental group,
who are no strangers to the Da.
vidson student body, will play with
a new addition to this sixteen piece-
vocalist combination. The introduc-
tion of a Xylophonist being
made. ,

Friday night, from nine to one
o'clock, has been chosen by the
Pan Heli as appropriate for the
informal dance; the Saturday night
dance will be formal, starting at
eight o’clock and concluding at
twelve.

This plan was decided upon in
order that students and their dates
might more conviently attend the
Friday evening presentation of the
“D” Club Foolies of 1950 which be-
gins at seven o'clock and lasts till
nine. Another activity of interest
will take plate Saturday afternoon

QUEEN, SENIORS HONORED

The dance will be highlighted by
the Saturday night announcement
and crowning’ of the Davidson

Added attractions include a large
figiire to be formed by the Pan Hel-
lenic Council, fraternity presidents
and their dates before intermis-
sion. A huge numeral “five” and
“zero,” will form a “fifty” in hon-
or of the graduating class.

Coat checking will be handled by
the “D” Club and all benefits will
be turned over to that organiza-
tion. Concessions will be sold un-
der the management of Paut Horne
in the basement of the gym for
those who desire them.

Tickets may be purchased from
Pan Hellenic representatives or from
the ticket office at' the front door
of the Johnson Gymnasium the
nights of the dances at the follow.
ing prices: $3.00 for a two night
set ticket, tax included; $2.00 for
one night, tax included. —

Bill Bird, as spokesman for the
Panhellenic Council, regretted and
wished to explain why the student
body under law could not put on
a private dance on their own cam-
pus without paying tax.

STUDENTS BETRAY TRUST

As will be remembered, the last
dance was sponsored by an inde-
pendent organization, the Pan Hel-
lenic Council, which extended blan-
ket bids to the fraternities, Inde-
pendents, and Campus Club. These
groups assessed themselves and
sold membership cards, thereby the
high expense of government taxes
was avoided. However, several stu-
dents betrayed their trust by sell-
ing tickets to young people in
Charlotte who wanted to come to
the dance,

Tax officials notified the Pan-
Hellenic Council that this infraction
had occurred and that dances in
the future should be financed so
that tax regulations would not be
violated. “Had the student body
cooperated _ satisfactorily”, said
President Bird, “we could have
continued the plan whereby we
were able to reduce the tickets for
the last dance from a would-be
$7.00 to $5.50.”
