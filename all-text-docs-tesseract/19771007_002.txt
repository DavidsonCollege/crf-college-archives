bad check. it contacts (the Bad Check Committee}. end we
comtact the student responsible for the check.”

If the student pays the check within ten days, he is clear. But
if he can't pey it, Dean of Students Will Terry has an emergencs

The student is given a deadline in which to pay the

The Bad Chack Committee has sent a pamphlet with ell this
Imformetion to 250 businesses in the area, asking the merchants
te help by notifying the schoo! promptly upon receiving @ bac
check. The faster the merchant replies. the higher the rete of
success in dealing with a bad check.

“The problem hes with about 30 students who are makime £

getting ready to lose a great privilege.” if busimesses like Kinz
Sirloin, which now requires identification, stop accepting
Devidson checks.

The Cornelius 7-11 has acquired eight bad checks simce schoo!

policy on accepting student checks. Cashions Grocery he:
