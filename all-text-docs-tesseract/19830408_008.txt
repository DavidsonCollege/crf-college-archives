8 Friday, April 8, 1983/The Davidsonian

Sorry guys. We lied. (Uh, isn’t lying — Oh, shut
up, Hunter! We don’t care if it is an Honor Code vio-
lation!) Due to circumcisions, er, circumstances
beyond our control, we are unable to bring you our

however, BB proudly publishes its guide to the 1983
Spring Frolics. Everyone knows about the BIG eve-
nts, but what about the smaller functions? Let’s take a
look at Patterson Court and see what’s shaking.

Pika: As a follow-up to their annual Wet Dream
Girl Formal, the Pikes plan to have a Beach Party.
Oh, what fun! By bringing in an incredible amount of
sand, the Betas hope to legitimize their football
throwing. Hey, people throw footballs at the beach
all the time. Perhaps Farrell and Martin should buy
some sand; it might help. Party-crashers should exer-
cise caution. As Patty McMaster warns, “Don’t F---
with Beta!”

ETC: ETC will celebrate (?) their last Spring
Frolics by crying over the demise of their house.
That’s it. Crying. As House President Laura
McDonald says, “Nobody wants to eat with a bunch
of SPEs. What makes you think anyone would want
to party with them?” Good point. Handkerchiefs re-
quired.

Warner Hall:In accordance with their massive
social budget, the Warner Hallies plan to have a
mixer with a male group from every college in the
Southeast. As one of the party girls said, “We get re-
ally tired of having the SAEs.” The E’s were repor-
tedly laughing as they left for their 293rd mixer of the
year.

F & M: As expected, F & M plans to have several
bong hit parties, much to the dismay of the Rusk

All-Faculty Party Team. In lieu of the Party Team,

—-BB Reviews Spring Frolics on Court

Scholars’ nanny, Sue. One Englishman was heard to
quip, “T’ ’ell wit’ wot she says! These blokes can
party!”

Phi Delt: The Delts plan to sit out on their new
Lambert Construction Co. bench and drink beer.
Okay, so that’s all they ever do, but nobody ever
claimed that the Delts have overactive imaginations.
With the departure of Dillon the Hun, passersby no
longer have to worry about being hit with beer bot-
tles; however, noted author Ben Pope (check his
latest work in front of the Delt house) plans to change
this. “Raise hell!” he commented.

SAE: The Hoddies plan to do what they do all the
time. ““We’re gonna spend lots of money, get really
drunk, and have lots and lots of sex!” claimed Clint,
Chip, Cliff, Clay, Stinky, Throbber, Craig, and the
Thumper Farabow, who has recently been named the
winner of the Mr. Split Personlaity Award as well as
the winner of the American Bald Eagle Look-Alike
contest.

ATO: As usual, the ATOs plan to save the
whales. Look guys, it’s not Rusk House that’s fold-
ing, it’s ETC! Wake up and smell the ambergris!

Emanon: Having blown their social budget on
their Easter celebration, the DCFers plan a quiet
weekend. Lance plans his own celebration. “Bleep
“em,” he said. Following Spring Frolics, Emanon
plans to hold an excommunication party for Mr.
Stokes.

PAX: Does anybody actually know these guys? If
so, let us know what’s going on.

BSC: We don’t know what the BSC has planned
for Spring Frolics, but we hope it’s not a rumble with
the the KKKA’s.

RUSK: “We like to think of Rusk House as a col-
lege service organization as well as an eating house,”
commented a young bovinous creature. In keeping
with this feeling, the Ruskies plan to help Tom “Par
3” Cartmill out in trimming the golf course. ‘““Udderly
incredible!” Cartmill quipped.

KA: “After those barfed-out things you said,
we’re not going to tell you about the maxed-out awe-
some weekend we’re having,” Social Chairman Joe
Calvin whined, Gee whiz, our weekend’s ruined.
Fiji: Aside from roasting a pig thoughtfully donated
by Rusk (a LARGE pledge class this year, we as-
sume), it’s business as usual at the Pizza Hut. Busi-
ness should be booming indeed, as Spring Frolics al-
ways results in sky rocketing drug sales.

SPE: Who gives a crap?

A final note on this weekend: we know you’re
wondering where the concert is gonna be. Well, we
can’t tell you that, but we can tell you where it’s not
gonna be. 1) The Golf Course. Cartmill refuses to
allow the golf course to be used, claiming that the
Masters will be moved from Augusta to Davidson.
“Hell, one fraternity already has half the Masters’
flags,” Tom claimed. 2) The Field Hockey Arena.
Although this is the most incredible place to have an
outdoor concert at Davidson, Field Hockey coach
Dee Mayes won’t hear of it. “They’ll ruin it!” she
cried. BB is having trouble with this. Chapel Hill puts
50,000 kids into Keenan Stadium for Chapel Thrill
(which, by the way happens to be worth millions of
dollars more than our lousy field hockey pit), and
D.C. can’t get 1,000 in the pit? We’re baffled. Oh
well... Shalom.
