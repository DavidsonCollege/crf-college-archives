next time.

The Softball Tourney got
underway last Monday, and
by Tuesday evening only one
of three previously undefeated
teams remained that way. KA
#1, behind the blazing fastball
of Mouse Sellers stunned last
week's #2 team, Jungle Queen,
by a score of 6-4.

Porky Pig and the Quarter

Pounders were knocked from
the ranks of the undefeated by
the long balls of Presto’s Grill,
6-4. Baby Rick’s Bar and
Grille crushed the Nothings of
Sigma Phi 22-7 and then
stepped into the double elimi-
nation round by frying the
Brewers 14-9.
’ Your Face, after being
dumped from our #1 spot,
reached the quarterfinals by
nipping the Longest Yard 9-8
and Rock and Roll Sunoco
20-17. The Gozinyas struck
out Bill Kelly and the rest of
Wood’s Hole 9-0 before
abusing Charlie's Angels 16-3.

Off Again tuned up in
defense of its crown by beating
the Red Sux 10-0. They were
saved from having to take on
Bad Bernard’s Cannonballs
because of the Basketball ban-
quet and stepped into the
quarterfinals by default.

The FIJI’s, the only non-
top ten team in the quarter-
finals, cleaned the Goodwin-
ities 12-11 and humiliated the

’ Bum Clevers 16-4. The SPE’s
~-rallied to beat the SAE’s 8-7

and must beat the undefeated
Flaming A’s for the right to
qualify for double elimination.

The tourney also marked
the end of the fabulous career
of the King of the Rear Ends,
Embonite Peter Green. PG’s
fellow rear ends fell to the
Bum Cleavers 17-16 in a
heartbreaker marking the end
of the first great phase of
EMBO sports history. Peter
was unavailable for any com-
ment as he had to go to the
prison to visit his mom.
However, in honor. of his
illustrious career, Peter is our
