Council Has Shaken ‘Police’ Label

Perrin Anderson and his administra-
tion bowed out in chapel this morning,
climaxing the most active and productive
year student government has seen here
in some time.

The perennial charge that the Council
constitutes only a police force, concerned
solely with violation of'the honor system
and student body regulations has been
completely shaken this year.

The bulk of Council activity has been
that of other than a watchdog agency.

Accomplishments range from secur-
ing probationary ROTC cuts to having
coke machines re-installed in the dorms.

The long-pending telephone issue has,
been pushed vigorously toward comple-
tion. A 947-name petition was delivered
to Southern Bell offices this past week.

The Court of Control has been sal-
vaged from the ludicrous position it was
left in last fall by combined actions of
both freshmen and upperclassmen. Now
thoroughly overhauled, the Court will be
reinstated in Chapel next September on
a trial. monthly basis.

Its ultimate success or failure. in this
make-or-break year rests almost com-
pletely with the attitudes adopted. by the
three upper classes in its administration.

Stiident government has also _per-
formed the heretofore neglected and ob-
viously vital function of keeping the Trus-

tees of the College properly aware of
student opinion and preferences on con-
troversial issues before us. This necessity
has been graphically illustrated in recent
weeks.

The list reviéwing the year’s progress
could be continued, almost indefinitely.

Aside from tangible, concrete achieve-
ments, the Anderson regime has been in-
strumental in fostering the indefinable at-
mosphere of genuine good will which now
exists between the student body and the
faculty and administration. This was not
always the case. as juniors and seniors
will be quick to testify.

While backed by an unusually able
and dédicated Council, in the final analy-
sis the essence of the year’s success must
be attributed to the dynamic leadership
provided by Perrin Anderson.

His capable spearheading of the Coun-
cil’s individual and collective efforts has
made the difference between mediocrity
and exceptional excellence in Davidson
student goverment.

Dan LaFar, his incoming Council, and
the student body which they represent
are faced with an evident and enormous
task.

Student government is stronger and

healthier than it has been in years.

The challenge is obvious.

Tragedy By-Product of a System

To a country that is in a state of uni-
versal armament, to young men expect-
ing military service momentarily. and to
parents who are going to have sons in
training, the Parris Island episode of
April 8th created a furious. uproar. On
the surface, it appeared that six lives
had been needlessly squandered in a
foolish attempt at discipline.

Sgt. McKeon, the drill instructor who
had led the disastrous night march, was
immediately thrust into the brig and the
Marine big brass, including the comman-
dant, was conducting an extensive in-
quiry into this “unprecedented” form of
training.

Almost daily the local papers note
that a military aircraft has exploded on
a training mission . . .crashing inexpli-
cably into the sea or plain. Paratroopers,
engaged in their dangerous and necessary
practice jumps, make occasional mis-
takes. . .men die. Capricious fate leads
personnel to death. in maneuvers. . .with
what seems to be accusing uselessness.

If it had been one of the above situa-
tions only cursory attention would have
been given the item mingled with other
stories clamoring for attention. The ser-
geant is not to be excused for making a
tragic error. But we must be aware that
he and his company had an enormous
amount of bad luck—and six men had
worse.

As it appears from scattered reports,
McKeon will be the scapegoat for the
system of training. A court-martial, a
public chastisement will be tendered him
and the higher echelons will escape criti-
cism.

Although the reports coming from
Parris Island glossed over the disciplin-
ary angle on this march, qualified per-
sons declare this method of training is
the commonplace occurence.

And, indeed, why shouldn't it be?
Parris Island and its drill instructors are
a legend. From recruits softened by the
comforts of America, the men must learn
to move automatically, propelled by re-
flexes toned by the exactness of the
training and rigid discipline until they
are ready to perform as the elite fighters
they are.

It is an affront to remind many people
that’ the soldier is trained to do two

things; to kill and to survive. The best
troops are those who undergo the most
rigorous training. It is so far better that
we lose six men now than to see thou-
sands die from sloppy preparation in
comhat.

‘McKeon had had the theme of the
drill instructor training, ‘Be sure no
man's ghost will ever say ‘If only your
training program had done its job!”

» drummed into him from the outset of

his own instruction. He made a mistake,
but an honest mistake.

Check’ on the: program, examine the
discipline practices, inquire into the
methods of the drill instructors. But re-
member that the Marines must be tough,
must be ready for anything.

In moments like this, we learn that
the peacetime death of a soldier is, some-
how. sadder than in war. Yet there are
those who cry for war. And there are
those who mock others who seek to
build the United Nations into an agency
capable of preventing war in any form.

Until it—or something else—is able
to do so. we will read the sad bulletins. . .
of men who have died for their country
in peace |. . because of human error.

Sorrow is greater and grief more bitter.
F.LH. Jr.

Tradition Intact

Vernal equinoxes, robins, and Pope
Gregory’s calendar to the contrary,
spring traditionally comes to Davidson
with Spring Frolics. Not before, not after.

Spring Frolics came and went last
weekend. So did the 600 girls. But still no
sign of permanent warm weather.

A persistent nip in the air had the
audacity to hang around, three whole
days after The Weekend. For a while, we
were worried.

Then came Thursday and the swelter-
ing sun, at long last. Maybe it was the
Convocation. More probably the Dodgers’
spring stranglehold’ on the National
League lead.

At any rate, it got hot, fast.»

Tradition is now happily intact and
the Frolics are still! potent medicine,
weatherwise and otherwise. Hand down
the sun tan lotion and that old blanket.
See you at the river.

ACROSS THE

PRESIDENT’S DESK

DAN LaFAR

PRESIDENT OF THE
STUDENT BODY

From an article written several
years ago in The Davidsonian I
quote the following:

“The major field in which
peace reigns. supreme is that of.
the student government. The pre-
sent administration has achieved
an amazing success in its accept-
ance by the students. Never be-
fore has there been so little criti-
cism of any regime. Never be-
fore has the. council gone about
its duties so unhampered by stu-
dent interest or concern.

“But perhaps this is to be ex-
pected when practically no infor-
mation of that body’s activities
ever reaches the -student’s ear—
not even through that ancient in-
stitution. the grapevine. If this
administration's goal was the
maintenance of the status quo,
they seem to be achieving it since
time is passing, and there is no
sign of any imminent change.”

The situation. expressed in the
above quote is one which 1 would
hope the student body of 1956-57
will not experience.

As I attempted to stress in my
campaign talk of not long ago,
I am convinced that itis not the
duty of student government to do
away with difference of opinion
nor even campus ferment, but
rather these should be the very
things which mold unified student
policy.

In order to reach decisions which
are both representative and sound
the Student Council installed to-
day will seek the broadest opinion

and as a liberator of a colonial
people. Thomas Jefferson was
praised for ‘his denfocratic ideals
in American government. Abraham

Lincoln was revered as the emanci-.

pator of a suppressed race. But
Wilson was the first. Américan to
become a citizen of the world.
Wilson meant for the other
peoples of the world a vision
of world peace and harmony,
just as he did for the citizens
of the United States. His was
a plan and a dream which
knew no national boundaries
or local prejudices.
The development of Wilson’s in-
ternationalism came late in life.
Even in the first years of the war
he supported American neutralism,

from as many students as are will-
ing to express themselves. In
order for students
themselves they: should be pre-
sented with as much actual infor-
mation as possible.

It is for this reason that this
column will be maintained—to
present students with as much in-
formation of what is going on as
possible. ;

.. This past year under the system

of open Student Council meetings,

an article was written, by the
Davidsonian reporter following
each regularly scheduled meeting
of the Student Council. The Stu-
dent Body was enlightened as to
the mechanics of operation and
the actual decisions of the Stu-
dent governing body; and this en-
lightenment has done much to
make the Student Council a more
representative body. It is my un-
derstanding, and hope that this
article will continue.

This coming year, in addition
to these regular Student Council
articles, I will attempt to write
an. informal column of the actual
problems in existence as they ap-
pear to me, and conduct a ‘be-
hind-the-scenes view of the vari-
ous activities that are connected
with Student Government.

The plan will be to use the ad-
vantages of this personal method
of communication only when is-
sues of vital interest or of much
affect to the Student Body are
at hand.

.... Last month the Davidson
Male Chorus sang in Clearwater
under the auspices of. the Ameri-
can Guild of Organists: here, and
sang at our two morning services
on Palm Sunday. The Male Chorus

gave an excellent concert, and
eee eee I was so very pleased
with the impression that the
Chorus made on our community;
both in the homes in which the
boys stayed and by their general
conduct while they were here,
and by the music that they pro-
vided. They gave an excellent
presentation of the quality and
spirit of Davidson. .

Davidson Delusions of Grandeur

“A hot-bed of intellectualism”

.a... “brain-trust” .. . and
an “institution for budding Phi
Betes” ... these are terms some:
times used to cescribe Davidson
College.

Many feel that our academic
standards are not only as high as
could be desired but that in many
cases they are entirely too high,
and for this reason there is some-
times a self-satisfied attitude
manifested where the scholastic
excellence of the school is con-
cerned.

It goes without saying that this
feeling is un-
healthy, for un-
less an_ institu-
tion is reaching

=) its academic
potential and

is hardly room
for self - con-

-gratulatory

“complacency.

Davidson is, in-

deed, an excel-

Conarroe

lent institution, but in any insti-
tution there is always room for
improvement.

Professor Ernest Stabler, a visi-
tor to our campus this year, spoke
to interested students about his
college, Wesleyan, in Watertown,
Conn., and gave some insights into
what is being done in a small.
liberal arts schoo! comparable in
many ways to our college.

Wesleyan has 750 students,
and even though its endow-
ment exceeds 19 million dol-
lars, the school has absolutely
no intention of becoming
larger.

How the college can justify its
limited enrollment is explained by
its president, Victor L. Butterfield:
“At the last meeting of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Board the
optimum enrollment was voted to.
be 750 undergraduates .. . How
can we justify thi.. action in the
face of a college population that
will double within the decade?

“Why should we not take
our proportionate share? Be-
cause we believe that by focus-

feeling that we had no definite ob-
ligation to the other countries in
the world to help to maintain
world peace. He was a pacifist, but
a pacifist only as far as America
was concerned.

By 1916, however, the idea
of internationalism had de-
veloped and was taking defi-
nite shape. He announced that
the United States would be
willing to take part in an as-
sociation of nations formed to
realize the objects: (1) self-
determination of peoples, (2)
equal rights of sovereignty and
territorial inviolability for alt
states, great and small, and
(3) an end to the destruction of
the world’s peace by aggres-
sion and disregard of rights.
This became his message to
the peoples of the world and
his platform for world peace.
This he began to draw America.

out of her shell of © isolationism
into a role in international affairs
and at the same time to offer a
positive plan for the peoples of
the world to rally around. It gave
them an incentive to fight harder
and sacrifice more in order to win
the ultimate victory and achieve
an era of no wars.

in doing this Wilson was
more than an American and
more than a leader of the
allies—he was a world leader.
In fact, in the end he lost the
support of America and had to
fight alone for his plan, prov-
ing that he was doing this for

ALLEN FRY

more than selfish national in-

terests.

By losing America, Wilson lost’
the necessary support to assure the
continuing success of his program.

By failing to heed Wilson's advice .

to take’ an active part in world
affairs, the United States helped
to bring about another World War,
much greater and: more devastat-
ing than the first.

Fortunately, however, the
United States has come to see
the wisdom of Wilson’s ideas
about our role in international
affairs. No longer do we fol-
low a policy of isolation.
Furthermore, through our ef-

forts as well as the efforts of those
countries who shared Wilson's
dream from the first. a more en-
during international organization
has been created. So far the United.
Nations itself, or the general feel-
ing generated by it, has been ef-
fective in. avoiding a major world
war.

It is fitting. therefore, that we
set aside a time to pay our respects
to our first and greatest. world
statesman. However, a more ap-
propriate tribute than all our
ceremonies and. laudatory phrases
would be a sincere dedication on
the part of all who revere the
principles for which Wilson stood
—a dedication to continually be
aware of our positions in our so-
ciety as world citizens, and to ac-
tively work to bring about that
dream of world peace which we
share with Wilson.

ing our resources we can
steadily improve the quality of
our contribution ... Our re-
sponsibilities to society will be
fulfilled only as we graduate
men who far out of propor.
tion to their numbers will help
give our country strength of
moral and intollectual leader.
ship...”

In a school with the reputation
of Wesleyan. it is natural that
there should be hundreds of ap.
plicants turned down each year,
and that many of these should be
the sons and nephews of alumni.

As Dr. Butterfield explains,
however, “Whatever the criteria
for admission, they must be ap.
plied to every man without favor

. . whether he be the son of a
plumber or of an alumnus, whether
he be Methodist, Presbyterian or
Jew, whether white, yellow or
black these things count
neither for nor against him . , .”

There are definite reasons
why Wesleyan, with other ex-
cellent liberal’ arts colleges, is
able to attract the most prom-
ising young men in the coun-
try, and why it is able to keep
its standards on a high plane.
With 750 students, Wesleyan has

a library containing over 400,000
volumes. Our library holds some-
what over 62,000 works. The Wes-
leyan student-faculty ratio is ap-
proximately 8-1.

There are 14 professors in the
English department, 7 in History,
5 in Psychology, 3 in Philosophy,
5 in Classics, 6 in Economics, 4 in
German and 6 in the Romanec
languages. There are more than
64 Doctors of Philosophy on the
faculty.

At Davidson, on the other
hand, we have only 1 1-2 teach-
ers for over 140 students tak-
ing German, a subject which
demands small classes and in-
dividual attention.

There is tittle doubt that David-
son, being where it is, and having
the resources and reputation which
it has, has a tremendous oppor-
tunity for academic leadership, yet
it seems that this opportunity
could be better met through rais-
ing: even higher the quality of the
education offered rather than
through the raising of the enroll-
ment.

As Dr. Butterfield writes, “A
college of liberal arts and
science is first and foremost
an academic institution ... If
a college seeks distinction for
quality, it will brook no com-
promise with this principle.
“It will place high premium on

intellectual distinction in its fac-
ulty and in its student body .. .
It must oppose unalterably the
mood of the times which distrusts
knowledge and intellect as worthy
in themselves .. .”
