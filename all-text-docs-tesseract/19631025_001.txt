ing st Grays Inn, London, and
later Queen’s Counsel.

Local civil rights advocates or-
ganized a racial progress group
at St. Alban’s Episcopal Church
yesterday.

The meeting, attended by 43
students and adults, was a Se-
quel to a preliminary meeting
held last Thursday under the
guidance of Buddy Triger, a
1963 Duke University graduate
employed as a field worker for
the Congress of Racial Equality.
(CORE). Triger, again present
yesterday, stated he would like
to see the new civil rights group
affiliate with CORE, yet he be-
lieved the creation of an active
local club, regardless of title,
would be an important step for-
ward.

A de facto nominating com-
mittee including Davidson stud-
ents Calvin Zon, Bill Ferris, Joe
Howell, Tom Vinson, and Hank
Taylor prepared the club’s slate

of officers. The nominees, elect-

ed yesterday by acclamation,
were Chairman, Mrs. Mary B.
Johnson; Vice-chairman, the Rev.
William Morris; Second Vice-
chairman, Calvin Zon; Secretary-
Treasurer, Hank Taylor, and

Chambers Auditorium. Informal
discussions will follow both ses-
sions.

His first book, A Separate
Peace captured the 1960 Ros-
enthal Award of the National
Institute of Arts and Letters, as
well as the first award of the
William Faulkner Foundation,
also in 1960. In its “Book Re-
view” section, the New York
Times compared the novel with
J. D. Salinger’s Catcher in the
Rye and Lord of the Flies by
William Golding. Like Salinger’s
novel, A Separate Peace takes
place in a prep school with a
16-year-old boy as principal
character.

According to Chairman Sid
Moore, the Books-of-the-Semes-
ter Committee selected Knowles’
book because of its timely sub-
ject and its popularity with col-
lege readers. The Intercolleg-
iate Magazine lists the novel
among the top 15 books in popu-
larity. throughout U.S. colleges.

Having written another novel,
Morning in Antibes, Knowles is
currently writer-in-residence at
the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill. He earned his
AB from Yale University after
graduating from Phillips Exeter
Academy.

Both of Knowles’ books are on
sale in paperback form in the
Knovel Knook at the Student
Union.

Executive Committee Slips

Pacifier —To AP Freshmen

BY TOM LOFLIN

Freshman football players on academic probation will now be allowed to partici-
pate in off-campus games as a result of Executive Committee action yesterday.

‘President D. G. Martin indi-
cated that the committee made
even more sweeping and liberal
proposals in regard to the aca-
demic probation rules. For one
thing, specific recommendations
were made in regard to proba-
tion at mid-semester.

“If the Faculty approves our
proposals, then the academic
probation rule now in effect will
be changed and we think for the
better,” Martin said. “But we
do not wish to say any more
about it at this time because
we do not want the Faculty, to
feel that we have committed
them publicly to anything.”

Martin would say that the
committee voted to recommend
to the Faculty that the current
six-week grade report for fresh-
men be considered non-official
and that the consideration be ap-
plied to all six-week grade re-
ports in future years. If this
is done, then no freshman would
be placed on probation because
of his first grade report.

Under the current academic

probation rule, any freshman
who does not have grades. that
represent 12 hours and 9 quality
points when the  six-weeks
grades are evaluated will be put
on academic probation and kept
on it until the end of the se-
mester. This means such a stud-
ent will not be allowed to miss
any academic exercises or rep-
resent the school in any off-
campus activity.

The committee, however, has
made an exception in the case
of the freshman football team
and resolved that: “Freshman
football players can participate
in off-campus football games
provided that they do not miss
any academic exercises in so
doing.”

Since the Faculty must ap-
prove the recommendation in its
next meeting, on Nov. 5, before
it can become school policy, the
Executive Committee felt that
something had to be done at
once to relieve the problem of
the freshman football team, the
only activity currently affected

INTEGRATIONISTS ORGANIZE
Group Guns At Core Of Racial Prejudice

Publicity Chairman, Tom Vin-
son. The executive committee
consists of the officers together
with Davidson Professors Sam
Maloney, Max Polley, and Ernest
F. Patterson, the latter three
unanimously added yesterday.

Though lacking official title
and constitution, the new group
readily publicized its basic aims
through the titles of its sub-
committees.

The subcommittees are for:
Negro Education and Voter Reg-
istration; Enrollment of Ameri-
can Negroes at Davidson Col-
lege; Investigating Economic
Conditions of Davidson Negroes;
Spiritual, Cultural, and Social
Contact within the Community;
and Gtudent Exchange Between
Davidson College and Johnson
C. Smith University (Charlotte).

Possible conflict with a local
di-racial committee, club ob
jectives, and the decision con-
cerning affiliation with CORE
were the primary topics mod-
erated by Bill Ferris during the
meeting.

The new club’s objective as
differentiated from that of a
recently established community

bi-racial committee was the first
topic the group attempted to
discuss.

(Note: F. L. Jackson, mayor
of Davidson, recently appoint-
ed @ committee composed of
local white and Negro citizens,
including several Davidson
faculty members, the purpose
of which would be to act as
both a “sounding board for
discovering racial problems in
the community” and es @
means of unobtrusively solv-
ing focal problems considered
inimical to the raciel harmony
of Davidson. No member of
the mayor’s committee attend-
ed the Thursday afternoon
meeting.)

Rev. Morris stated, “The may-
or’s committee will deal with
grievances presented to it; our
committee’s aim should be to
search out local problems, yet
it should not create crises.”
Others concurred that the may-
or’s committee wouldn't act
until trouble developed, where-
as the new group would seek to
stymie problems before ‘‘action”
was necessary.

Zon emphasized that the new

“group was in no way.a clandes-
tine organization. Zon envision-
ed the goals of the group as
twofold: to improve communi-
cations between the white and
Negro communities and to Th
prove the economic, social, and
political status of the Negro
community. The office “Publi-
city Chairman” is evidence of
the group's candor, Zon com-
mented.

In a specific proposal of
objective, Or. P. B. Secor,
Davidson professor, moved
formation of a subcommittee
to “expedite integration of
Devidson College social fra-
ternities.” His motion was
later reworded to place this
objective under the auspicies
of the “Sociel Contact” com-
mittee, At this time it was
pointed out that Davidson's
two native Congolese students
do not eat meals on the fra-
ternity court.

Concerning the question of
CORE affiliation, field worker
Triger restated that he wasn’t
present solely to organize a
CORE chapter—but added,
“CORE affiliation would add
strength and prestige ... ”

by the six-week. grade report.

If the Facutty next month ap-
proves the resolution for abol-
ishing the official status of
freshman six-week grade re-
ports, all freshmen who are to
be placed on probation this
month will be removed from it.
They will no longer be held re-
sponsible for meeting probation
requirements.

Freshmen are tne only stud-
ents who are graded at the end
of the first six weeks of school.
All students are subject to be-
ing placed on probation at the
grade report mid-semester.

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts pointed out that the com.
mittee was not trying to abolish
the six-week reports for begin-
ning students. “We will continue
to have them for evaluation pur-
poses, and we will continue to
send the grades home,” he said.
“But the committee is recom-
mending that they not be used
in a official capacity; ie. to
place students on probation for
failing to meet a set standard.”

Robert Mormon, a local Negro,
stressed that CORE uses varied
tactics and resorts to demonstra-
tions only. as a final effort to
dispel problems.

Dr. Patterson stated, “It
would damage the effect local-
ly if we affiliated with CORE.”
Patterson, nevertheless, favors
non-violent action.

Dr. Secor advised that the
group delay affiliation with
CORE until Davidson’s racial
problems were defined by the
committee, at which time the
members could decide what, if
any, national organization could
best aid solution of local prob-
lems.

A motion that the club remain
autonomous at present was pro-
posed by Davidson Professor
Polley. The motion passed.

The new civil rights group has
scheduled meetings for the first
and third Tuesday of each
month; however, it will meet
again next Tuesday night at St.
Alban’s at 8 p.m. Though David-
son students constituted a major-
ity of those attending Thurs-
day's meeting, the club has not
sought a charter as a Davidson

2-—-Football game
8—Concert, Chad Mitchell Trio

NUMBER SEVEN

Davidson’s 40th annual Homecoming Day will be
held tomorrow highlighted by the Davidson-Presbyterian
College football game and featuring the revivals of a
student-alumni barbecue and the selection of a Homecom-

ing Queen for 1963.

The homecoming celebration,
which began with the dedication
of the Richardson Athletic Field
in 1923, will attract to the cam-
pus many graduates as
well as an estimated 750 or more
girls who will be here for the
first of three IFC dance week-
ends,

The weekend's events actual-
ly began this afternoon. David-
son's once-beaten soccer team
took on the visiting Mountain-
eers from. Appalachian State
Teachers College at 2 o'clock.

Tonight at 8:15 in Cham-
bers Auditorium, Carlos Mon
toys, the Spanish flemenco
guitarist, will open this year’s
Artist Series with a concert.
Montoya wes born in Madrid
the son of Spanish gypsies.
He began playing the guitar
at the age of eight, won early
recognition in Europe and has
since played in concerts a-
round the globe.

After the concert the Union
Social Committee is sponsoring
a formal dance in the Morrison
Room of the College Union. The
dance is open to the student
body at no admission charge.
Music will be provided by Sid
Farrar’s combo.

Saturday morning will be fill-
ed with a round of meetings for
alumni in the Union. The an-
nual meeting of the Wildcat
Club, the alumni group that as-
sists Davidson’s athletic pro-
gram, will be held at 11 a.m.

The student-alumni barbecue,
which has not been held in re-
cent years, will be held in the
center of Patterson Fraternity
Court (weather permitting).
Serving will begin at noon and
will continue until the beginning
of the football game at 2.

With six or eight lines serv-
ing at all times, Bill Bondu-
rant, alumni director in
charge of the barbecue, prom-
ises quick service for every-
one. In case of inclement
weather on Thursday or Fri-
day, the luncheon will be held
in the old quadrangle in front
of the Fine Arts Building. If
it is raining on Saturday, the
barbecue will be served in the
old Chambers dining hall.

Eight fraternities have voted

to eat with the alumni in the
center of the court. The board

Independents may purchase

tickets for the luncheon at the
Union desk. Bill DeVaughn,
president. of Lingle Manor, indi-
cated considerable interest from
his group in the meal.

‘It’s actually cheaper for fra-
ternity men as well as Indepen-
dents,” pointed out Bondurant.
The charge is 75 cents for single
or couple. Bondurant said that
chairs, stands and tables will be
set up and promised a “gay,
festive atmosphere.”

Members of the Class of
1928, who will be celebrating
their 35th reunion, will be
honored guests at the barbe-
cue. Other special guests will
include the candidates for
Homecoming Queen.

Kickoff for the homecoming
game will be at 2. Neither Dav-
idson nor Presbyterian has any-
thing to boast about this season.
The Wildcats will be looking for
their first win since they trounc-
ed this same PC team on Oct. 6
last year.

Halftime activities will  in-
clude the crowning of the Home-
coming Queen and the introduc-
tion of the new Alumni Associa-
tion officers. The Interfraternity
Council has planned to give the
queen an engraved trophy along
with a dozen red roses.

The IFC concert at 8 p.m.
tomorrow will feature the
Chad Mitchell Trio in Cham-
bers Auditorium.

After the concert the various
fraternity after-parties will be
held off campus and, as on Fri-
day night, will last into the wee
hours of the following morning.

All dormitory space for the
weekend has been taken, accord-
ing to Mrs. J. B. Moore, super-
visor of dormitories. On Wed-
nesday afternoon, Mrs. Moore
had a long list of alumni and
guests waiting for rooms; how-
ever, she anticipated no troudle
in placing those for the week-
end since there are usually
enough cancellations at the last
minute to accommodate them.

Homecoming is one of three
weekends during the year in
which nearly half the boys va-
cate their dormitory rooms to
provide rooms for their dates.
“Homecoming is naturally big-
ger than Midwinters or Spring
Frolies,” explained Mrs. Moore,
“so that’s why we have this
waiting list.”

IFC President Haynes Kelly is
expecting a typical Davidson
dance weekend. “Everything’s
set and we're looking forward
to a really good weekend,” said
Kelly in the middle of the week.
