The film directors who best exem-
plify the spirit of our age are Kenneth
Anger, Michelangelo Antonioni,
Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Jean-Luc
Godard, Dusan Makaveyev, Ken
Russell and Paul Morrissey before he
started trying to go Hollywood.

Implicit throughout their works is an
instinctive recognition of the way films
were once made is exactly the way
they can no longer be made, that a
director who bores an audience with
his good taste is a traitor both to him-
self and to that audience, and that the
only useful purpose the old rules can
serve is to remind directors of the
techniques they had best not try to
revive.

Like the romantic poets of the last
century, these men are driven to ex-
press visions that could not be found
except flickeringly in the art of their
media which surrounded them in their
youth.

The recent works of, say, Bunuel,
Fellini and Wilder-- and, one might
add, -the complete works | of
Bogdanovich-- are of lesser im-
portance because they fail to vibrate
with any urgent sense of mission or ex-
ploration.

These artists do not throw them-
selves into their works so completely
as Morrissey, Russell, et al, and the
result is that there simply is not as
much in their works-- not as much of
what is important in art-- intensity,
perhaps, or the anguish of talent
bursting forth, or the expression of hu-
man feeling--whatever.

The films of Makaveyev, Godard
and the rest effect us on certain levels
even more profoundly than such
classics as ‘‘Ivan the Terrible, Part!”
and ‘‘Casablanca’’ because they speak
directly to and of our condition. They
will not address themselves with equal
eloquence to all generations, but I
suspect they will always have an edge
over the films made by those directors
of our age who lack the strength to in-
corporate what’s going on both within
and without themselves into the tex-
ture of their art.

And what, pray tell, may be this
“spirit of our age’’ (Heaven help me,
but I really think we have one)?

I might set down some exorbitantly
melodramatic pronouncements at this
point but will restrain myself for once.
Quite frankly, I’ve never stuck my
head outside theater doors for long
enough to have accumulated any
legitimate impressions on the subject.
but I have noticed certain tendencies
in the films of our time which
distinguish them from those of other
periods-- tendencies which receive
dazzling if not always_brilliant con-
summations with Fassbinder, An-
tonioni and the others.

Oh well, it all has to do with existen-
tialism. man’s feeling that he needs to

In a time when many
American jazz musicians are
leaving lountry for Europe,
where they think the cultural
climate aids their work more
than here, Michal Urbaniak is a
European who has come to
America in more or less the
make it to the big time pattern
of success.

a

Dudziak stir European airs

Urbaniak has lived and.

worked in several countries of
Europe, among them Poland
and Sweden. His band, Fusion,
features Urbaniak on violin and
his wife Urszula Dudziak in
numerous vocal guises.

The group has won much suc-
cess in Europe, and Urbaniak
was named Musician of the
Year by Jazz Forum, Europe’s
most prestigious jazz

publication. Now they are in the -

perceive things directly but cannot.
“the psychic dislocation of modern
sensibility.’’ The volcanic roman-
ticism of Anger and Russell gives
stylistic expression to despair over our

. Situation, whereas the stoicism of An-

tonioni and Fassbinder seems to in-

dicate acceptance. and the youthful .

joie de vivre of Makaveyev celebration
even.

These directors make films exactly
as most “critics’’-- John Simon, pack
leader-- think they should not be made.
Casual viewers-- again. most
“‘critics’’-- take their movies for: won-
drously inept because on one level, the
surface level, many are intentional
travesties, and this is the only level the
many are able to see, and even this
they misinterpret.

With ‘‘Alice Doesn’t Live Here
Anymore’’-- note the negation in the
title--Martin Scorsese steps more
firmly into this hallowed group than he
had managed heretofore.

“Boxcar Bertha” hardly promised
at all, but there was one moment in
‘“‘Mean Streets’’ that promised
mightily-- a pyrotechnic camera swirl
through a restaurant. one of the more
precisely defined camera monents I’ve
ever run across.

“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore”’
isn’t altogether the miracle we had
reason to hope for from Seorsese.

It begins brilliantly with the eight
year old Alice-- in a barnyard
luminously steeped in red. ac-
companied by a constantly roaring
camera- singing and declaring herself
a better vocalist than Alice Faye.

As she spreads her arms and runs up
the porch steps into her house, her
voice vibrates on the soundtrack until
it resembles a jet roar, and the image
collapses to a pinpoint. Suddenly. the
full width of the screen (exact dimen-
sions variable at the discretion of your
local theater manager) springs to life
with the camera having a grand time
among wind-machine tousled treetops
in present day New Mexico.

However, by the time the camera
has alighted outside the grown-up
Alice’s window, the best part of the
movie has passed. The whole is done
up in erratic anti-rhythms, and the
color scheme remains about as tacky
as could be hoped for. but very little of
what follows can begin to measure up
to the baroque, pop-art grandeur of
that opening.

Scorsese’s rebellion is only partial:
he seems still to subscribe to the old

‘wives’ tale that most of a movie should

be “subdued”’-- which usually amounts
to an excuse for dull and uninspired--
so the climaxes will have something to
contrast against. In this, and con-
sidering the razzle-dazzle nature of his
talents, Scorsese would do well to
follow the illustrious example set by
Russell, who shows us that every scene

reel to reel

Anger, Antonioni
exemplify spirit

can be a full-blooded climax in its own
right, and that when the time comes

for a real climax all bedlam can be |

loosed on the audience.

Another problem with the film is that
Scorsese more intreprets' than
dynamites Robert Getchell’s screen-
play, and dynamite is sorely needed.

True, Scorsese splatters his per-
sonality all over the film, and his in-
terpretation, for what it’s worth, is
damned imaginative, but the screen-
play is still a cute bundle of fantasi-
zing, the kind of thing an artist like
Scorsese shouldn’t have to waste his
time on.

Much of the film is comedy, not ab-
surdist, camp or surrealist comedy.
just simple slapstick a la ‘‘Young
Frankestein,”’ the kind of comedy that
generally doesn’t amount to much
even when it’s nicely executed, as that
in ‘‘Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore”
doubtless is.

In all liklihood, Scorsese should have
plunged brazenly ahead making the
film as he thought best. instructing the
actors to think of other things as they
delivered their lines (as Morrissey
has sometimes done) and giving the \
screenplay absolutely no quarter. An
approach more ‘dislocated’ than that
would be difficult to imagine.

_ Dear. Heart. we live in a cynical
décadent age. an age of what is usually
called form for form’s sake but it is
really form because man happens to
like form.

If there is one rule for today’s

\cinema, it is that form must have ex-

pansiveness and freedom, and ‘“‘con-
tent really doesn’t make that much dif-
ference,”’ since hopefully form serves
both functions.

Think of Ingmar Bergman, chugging
away at his ‘‘content’”’ in the
traditional sense of the word and
coming up with disaster after disaster.
“The Touch.” his only successful
movie in recent years. is also the one
which least seems to wear its ‘‘con-
tent’’ on its chest as though that ‘‘con-
tent’? were a medal of honor-- or
worse.

The closest thing to an exception to
all I, have been saying which I can
muster at the moment is the career of
Satyajit Ray. But Ray’s films emerge
from the mire of a national cinema
which has developed along radically
different lines from that of the rest of
theworld. —

His films seem a part of something
other than an intrinsic exception. Just
as the energy in our cinema comes
from those film makers who are out to

_ shatter prevailing conventions, so that

in the Indian cinema comes from Ray

and his fellow realists. The major dif-

ference. for: the purposes of our

present discussion, is that they are

struggling against different systems.

United States, the place -Ur-. '
baniak thinks any —<on--
temporaty Européan musician —
should set as his goal. soe

Atma is the first American
release of the group, though
they have put our a dozen suc-
cessful records in Europe. ‘The
album is a finely recorded trip
into European jazz. All of the
songs are very. polished,
providing smooth listening if
losing some air of informality
and improvisation.

Side one features the violin of
Urbaniak. His electric in-
strument often sounds like the
violin of the Mahavishnu Or-
chestra, yet, not so thin. Nor is
his playing drowned out by the
blare of any other over am-
plified back ups.

‘““Mazurka”’

The first song on the record is
‘“‘Mazurka,”’ and the title
describes the atmosphere of a
peasant dance or folk tune. Ur-
baniak’s violin sounds like a
slightly modified Bartok, with a
touch of Vassar Clemens. This
song draws from the European
roots as American jazz uses the
old spiritual and _ blues
traditions.

Other songs on this side use
the electric violin more. The
thin whine of these songs are
the weakest part of the record.
But even these are better than
similar songs often .done by °
Mahavishnu. Urbaniak has not
apparently found Krishna yet,
so his electric numbers are not
so inane.

Second to Urbaniak

Helping to make these cuts as
good as they are is the per-
cussion of Czeslaw Bartkowski.
He is second to Urbaniak in
prominence on this side of the
record. His drumming is fier-
cely fast yet unobtrusive,
coming out only when
necessary.

The second side of the album
presents Urbaniak’s wife in
vocal accompaniment.”° Her
“singing”’ is one of the truly in-
novative additions to modern
jaz.

Singing in the style Cathy
Berberian made famous, Ms.
Dudziak sereams,  caws,
gurgles, and coos her way
gloriously through this side of
the disc.

Array of Sounds

In addition to her own vocal
contortions, Dudziaks voice is
sometimes electrically
modified to add the array of
sounds.

On parts of “Kama” her voice
merely accompanies the
melodic line of the violin. This
song almost sounds like Sergio
Mendes. except for. the

_ screeching violin.

But on the last three cuts of
the record, collectively titled
“Atma,”’ she puts on a show of:
almost every sound imaginable.
She also has a solo LP out.

Fusion experience

Urbaniak ‘was scheduled to
appear in Davidson last Sun-
day. but due to the illness of
mis wite tney were not able to
come. They played to sell out.
crowds upon arriving in New
York last year. The album
shows that “Fusion’’ offers a
new experience in modern jazz,
drawing influences from both
the European folk) traditions
and numerous. strands of
American music.
