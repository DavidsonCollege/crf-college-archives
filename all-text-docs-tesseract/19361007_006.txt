Seven sophomores are also available
for line positions. Red Echols and

John Seaton will contest Farley
for guard positions. Strickler and
Gray are probable tackles. Ray
Taylor and Ray Britton are two

sophomore ends, who want to oust
the veterans, while Dick Irby is an-

other V. M. I. center.

The Cadet flying squadron will
do some rambling this season, as
they only play three of their ten
games at home. Last year the Wild-
