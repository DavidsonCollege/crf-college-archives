Crime Beat

Commons employees arrested in car shootings

- By DAVID SCOTT

Crime hit the Davidson College
campus again as several cars were
shot at or spray-painted in the
parking lot of the Commons,
around Patterson Court and in the
area immediately surrounding the
college during the weekend of
January 14. At least four had
windows shot out and a large
swastika was painted on the side
of a catering truck.

Arrested in the incidents were
three seventeen year old employ-
ees of the Commons, Eric
Hastings, Chris Lehew and Chris
Houser, and one juvenile. A BB
pistol and a can of spray paint
provided the weapons.

Jackie Hughes, director of pub-

involved have been apprehended,
and all have confessed.

_ Rumors that the actions may
have been racially motivated
seem to be unfounded. The tone
of each of the confessions sug-

gests a general bewilderment at .

why each of them did what he did.
If anything, the motive appears to
have been the ever-present search
for coolness.

Lehew told police in a state-
ment how one suspect was “talk-
ing about how he had heard that
windows would bust really easy if
you shot them with a BB gun. I
didn’t think they would, but Chris
(Houser] shot one and it ex-
ploded. It was really cool looking.
I guess I got carried away. | figure
on the way out I got 3 or 4 more...

It was all really stupid!”
Hastings described to police
how the group had shot out the
windows of a jeep on Concord
Road, had spray-painted cars on
Patterson Court and had shot out

the windows of a Volkswagen

parked behind the Commons.

Houser also admitted to shooting
at Cars.

Hughes stated that the group
would probably not go to trial
until March due to the extensive

paperwork and red tape that must
be handled before further action
can be taken. Officer Emory

McLaurin noted that the offense
is a misdemeanor, and estimated
the maximum punishment at $500
and/or six months in jail. The
suspects are more likely to go
under “deferred prosecution” and
made merely to pay back the
damages, McLaurin said.

New logo selected to unify college’s public image

A new logo has been designed to adorn
all Davidson College publications and sta-
tionery. With a development cost reported

some good and some terrible.” Although
the official college logo was “Davidson
College” in black letters with only the “D”

than “Davidson College.” Other. colleges
such as Haverford and Harvard already
have a practice of omitting “college” or
“university” and placing the emphasis

to be in the

Stockdale, di- Out with the old...

‘rector of Col-
lege Relations, the decision to redesign the
college logo resulted from a desire to.cor-
rect inconsistencies in college materials.
The design features the word
“Davidson” written in upper-case letters
and underscored by a red bar. A white
diamond is reversed out of the bar immedi-
ately under the “V.”
In May 1988, college president John
Kuykendall commissioned a task force (the
‘Work Group on Communicating the Mis-
sion and Goals of Davidson College) to
study how the college was projecting its
“image through af aoe relations materi-
als.

even meal tickets were studied. The group

and “C” capitalized, it was not being used
consistently by: the entire college. Some
departments made up their own letterhead,
says Stockdale. In fact, eight different
typefaces were being used to write
“Davidson College. Ee

The work group made a recommenda-
tion to assign the duty of developing a
“graphic identity” to a committee of col-
lege administrators. Stockdale served as
chair of the group.

The committee was advised by Balti-
more consultant Robert Rytter, president
of R.S. Jensen Company. The company

‘specializes in developing graphic pro-

grams for colleges and universities. Rytter
developed a set of possible logos from

The committee feels that a consistent and
bold image is something Davidson College
needs in order to present itself positively,

The proposed new logo is. pending for-
mal approval by Kuykendall, although he
has given a verbal endorsement of the rede-
sign and some publications have begun to
make use of the design.

Stationery, mailing labels and business
cards will also be printed with the new
logo. Color combinations such as red-black
and gray-black are available in addition to
the regular black print.

Upon receiving approval from Kuyken-
dall, the committee is expected to propose
that another group develop a unique design

That job would involve choosing one draw-
