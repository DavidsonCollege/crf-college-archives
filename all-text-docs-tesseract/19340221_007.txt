WILDCATS MEET
ERSKINE FRIDAY

The old saying, “Every dog has his

day,” can be well applied to the au-
thorship of “Firing at Random.”
Hold on for a few more weeks, read-
ers, while we inexperienced sopho-
mores take our unsteady aim at “ Ran-
dom.”

Next week will bring to a close
what has been a rather disastrous
winter sports program. Our Wild-
cat basketeers were annihilated in
the state race. All four of the
other teams in the Big Five de-
feated them twice. Friday night
the quintet will tangle with Er-
skine; let’s all go down and help
them win their third collegiate vic-
tory. Two victories over the same
Little Six team should never go
down as the record of any David-
son team. The record chalked up
by the frosh is much better than
that of the varsity, and they are
to be commended for their-victory
last week over the Tar Babies.
The ‘Kittens still have three games
before they turn in their unfiorms
Saturday. They ought to boost
their average and finish in a blaze
of glory.

The grapplers made their first ap-
pearance before the student body last
week-end when they lost to the Uni-
versity of North Carolina. Handicapped
throughout the season by injuries and
a lack of weight in the heavier classes,
these Wildcats have turned in a good
account of themselves against some
stiff competition. Blackwelder and
Hodgin looked good against Carolina,
the former in victory and the latter
in defeat, as they took on men who
outweighed them ten and fifty pounds
respectively. N:C. State’s wrestlers
gave Carolina a duck egg; so if you
want to see some real matches, keep
your eyes on the Wildcats when they
fight State Saturday night.

tball promi to re-

veal, or re-emphasize, some real
talent for the 1934 Red and Black
machine. The practice game of
last week was ragged, but taking
plays here and there throughout,
one could get together one quarter
of good. football. Those who saw
the game know that Wingfield and

Mackorell can still lug that leather

when given the chance. Dick

Johnson, Big Six Johnston, and

John Newton looked mighty good

in the line. ,

Saturday night in the course of the
Freshman - Lees McRae ' baskefball
game, Coach Peabody summoned
Peters to put him in. Peters proceed-
ed to remove his sweat clothes, but
was his face red—! he didn’t have on
any pants. The Lees-McRae team,
which is coached by Fred Dickerson,
a Davidson graduate, was playing its
second game of the season. The boys

from Banner Elk have been in quar-|'

antine on account of measles. They
played the freshmen on even terms in
the first half and put up a good fight
in general. Congratulations, Fred!
That was a good football team you
brought to Davidson last fall, too.

It has always been a mystery to
the men of Davidson that some
few are willing to jeopardize the
good name of Davidson's Wildcat

_ Spirit in athletics and sportsman-
“ ship by such actions as the “boo-

ing” which took place at the
wrestling match with Carolina. It's
such’ actions as this that cause
sports to be taken out of the pro-
gram of athletics: In fairness to
our wrestlers, our coach, our vis-
itors, and ourselves, let’s make it
a point to put a stop to this sort
of thing by not doing it ourselves,
and discouraging it in others. Gen-
eral disapproval is the best rod fo
discipline we can keep in the closet
ready for use.

For my part, I’d give a pretty price
for a ticket to a game between the
All-Time Davidson team and the Duke
Blue Devils of 1933, North Carolina’s
Rose Bowl contenders. It would un-
doubtedly be a thriller, perhaps with
a reverse of the score of our game
with them. this year. There are not
many students here now who can re-
call the grid exploits of these war-
fiors, but some of us who have fol-

Duke and Carolina Games Well
Fought

The Davidson freshmen were over-
powered Monday night by a strong
Duke team, 33-25, in a double-header
played in Durham:

The game was well fought with the
fresh offering threat after threat, only
to be turned back by the superior
Duke team. Playing heads-up ball,
our first-year men led their opponents
during the first quarter, but were
slightly behind in score as the whistle
brought the half to an end. Duke's
freshmen led throughout the second
half, but never had a lead sufficient
enough to use any but their best men.

Peabody was high point man for
the game, amassing a total of 11 points.
The team played well as a unit and
showed much team spirit throughout
the contest.

D. C. Frosh-Carolina Frosh

A neck-to-neck contest was brought
to a close Tuesday night when the
Davidson freshmen eked out a 24-22
victory over the strong Carolina first-
year team at the University.

Davidson led at the half, 12-10, and
never exceeded a four-point lead. Both
teams were playing at their best and
the game was in the hands of fate till
the last basket was made by our first-
year men, gaining the victory for the
Kittens,

Knorr starred for the home team,
making a total of nine points to gain
the distinction of being high point man

Davidson-Salisbury
Davidson men ran rough-shod over

Salisbury High in the local gym to the

tune of a 29-15 score:

The outcome of the game was never
in doubt, with the fresh leading their
opponents at the end of each quarter
by at least 10 points. Many members
of the second and third teams were
sent into the contest so as to gain ex-
perience for future games.

Cathey was high point man, making
10 points, to be followed closely by
Quick with eight.

Davidson-Lees-McRae

Porter and Swindle starred for the
freshmen as they gained a decisive
victory over Lees-McRae Saturday,
gaining nearly twice as many points
as their opponents, the score being
43-22,

Tuesday night the freshmen played
Boiling Springs. The result of this
game was not known at the time of
publication.

alternates will be chosen.

een holes played here; and then, the
cight high men will go to Charlotte

yet been made out, but they will meet
Duke, N. C. State and Carolina in two

Furman, Georgia Tech, and either
Emory.or the University of Georgia.

At present fourteen of the men out

tournament, but the students are lead-
ing by a slight margin.

day morning programs from its cam-
pus. The broadcasts deal with edu-

contest, conducted by Jake Wade,
Charlotte’ Observer sports writer,

a decided favor to football players by
giving the first four places to the grid-
ders.

of Duke, is leading the field of more
than eighty other candidates by polling
a total of 162 votes. George Barclay,

gin.

Davidson Cagers Meet
Erskine’s Flying Fleet

Fresh Basketball Team Meets
Two High School Foes

This week the Davidson varsity and
freshman cage schedules. will come to
a close as the Wildcats meet Erskine’s
Flying Fleet on Friday night, and the
‘Kittens end their victorious year ‘With
games with the Crossnore High School
on Friday night and Burlington High
on Saturday night.

In the Flying Fleet the varsity will
meet a dangerous foe. The boys from
Erskine have a fast, aggressive com-
bination. Théy have won three out
of three in their last encounters. Their
latest victory was a close but decisive
win over The Citadel.

Coach Laird’s boys have had a bit

‘lof trouble getting started in their late

games, and it will take some fighting
to overcome the boys from the Pal-
metto State.

As a preliminary to the varsity game
on Friday, the yearlings will take on
Crossnore High, of whose team not
much is known, On Saturday night
the ’Kittens are scheduled to meet an-
other prep quint in Burlington High,
and again meet an unknown quantity.

The Peabody-coached freshmen have
been going at top speed this season
and have not had much to worry
about, and there is not much doubt as
to the final outcome of these last two
contests,

Football Casualties

A few injuries sustained dur-
ing football practice last week
were not enough to _ prevent
Coaches Newton and McEver
from having four full teams to
work with Monday.

B. L. Garrison, freshman back-
field luminary, received a deep
cut over the eye and will prob-
ably be unable to don a uniform
for several days. His injury,
while painful, was not as serious
as was at first feared.

“Wimpy” Ravenel is resting
for a few days in order to give
an old chest injury time to heal.
He is expected to be in uniform
at an early date, but will be un-
able to scrimmage for quite a
while.

Jim Batte, utility man, has
been on crutches for a few days,
nursing a torn leg ligament. He,
too, is expected to be back at
pee soon.
