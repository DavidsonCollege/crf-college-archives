Foreign studies

Davidson o

Grizzard

By BOB GRIZZARD
Staff Writer

The opportunity Davidson provides
for students to travel and study
outside of the United States is indeed
lone of its greatest assets. I have
travelled abroad on both academic
hand non-academic ventures.

In the spring and summer of 1975, I
worked for the Knox Community
Development Foundation in Spal-
ding, Jamaica, and in the summer of
1976 I studied on the Davidson
program at St. Anne’s College of
Oxford University.

Either way, every Davidson stu-
dent should seriously consider spend-
ing some time away from Davidson

during his four year, twelve term
““career’’.

One cannot escape the fact that
Davidson is a small, fairly homogen-
eous community, and any student
with a sensitivity toward the ‘‘outside
world”’ should go and live in that
world to better understand Davidson,
the “‘outside’’, and himself. The most
frequent result is a greater toleration
of each.

The benefits of living in and

learning about another culture are °

certainly significant in themselves.
At the very least, living abroad
provides a new vocabulary, both
literally and figuratively, with which
to understand and speculate upon
one’s own limited world.

Equally important are the benefits
time off from Davidson. can provide
for the academic grind itself. The ten
week term, relentless and intense,
demands a matching enthusiasm and
intensity from students, and for
twelve consecutive terms, despite
those all too short summers, this sort
of intensity can be unbearable.

If three months is the longest you
have been away from academia since
you were six years old, don’t you owe
yourself a new perspective?

WINE, WOMEN and romance—you do have the option.

Politics and Economics go Eur

By KEVIN WHITE

To acquaint them with the
political and economic aspects
of European culture, twenty-
three Davidson students part-
icipated in the European Eco-
nomics Seminar last month.
These students, accompanied
by Professors Edmondson and
Kincaid, toured London,
Brussels, Paris, Bonn and
Luxembourg for an extensive
‘four weeks.

“The trip was tremendous,”’
commented Sophomore Dave
Piper. ‘‘It was well-planned
and organized. There were no
major foul-ups at all.”’

Dave, an Economics major,
believes firmly in the value of
a foreign studies program.

ment. Academic stimulus is
confined to the classroom and
the library. Foreign study
gives you the unique oppor-
tunity to see what you learn.

“It provides the stimulus
and excitement to make learn-
ing a living experience, some-
thing which doesn’t exist
here.”’

Linda Jones, a senior Eco-
nomics major felt the same
enthusiasm for the program.
“It has certainly spurred me
on in my area of study. It was
the highlight of my academic
career.”’

Both Linda and Dave feel
the cultural differences be-
tween Europe and the U.S.
Linda commented, ‘‘It’s a
much slower way of life. What
surprised me the most was

how quiet the cities seemed!
Even on the subways everyone
seemed to whisper!’!

Linda continued, ‘‘Another
big difference is the greater

Dave was impregsed with
other cultural differences.
“The people are definitely
more liberal and the culture
much richer.”

Oxford
England

Dr. Anthony Abbott, who
headed the summer program
at St. Anne’s in Oxford last
year, considers it “invaluable
in putting us in touch with our
own heritage in that we con-
sider ourselves part of the
English-speaking culture.”

“It was a total breaking
away from Davidson. You get
to see a culture that is
different than that of a tour-
ist’s perspective because you
are actually living with them,”’
said Abbott.

Ann Wicker stated, ‘‘But
like any university town, all
the English students are gone
in the summer.” Although not
in classes with English stu-
dents, according to Kathleen
Golding, ‘traveling is the best
way to meet a lot of people.”

The general discovery was
that the adjustment is almost

non-existent. ‘‘Because there
is no language problem,”’ says
Dr. Abbott, ‘‘you can imme-
diately immerse yourself in,
and enjoy, the change in
culture.”’

“It’s a maturing experi-
ence,”’ states Holmes Harden,
“for virtually the first time,
you take the sobering fact that

. you’re off on your own with no

place to turn except your own
resources.”

Madrid
Spain

Dr. Lois Kemp, who led the
pilot program to Spain in the
spring of 1975, ‘‘gives the
students the opportunity to
live the language such as they
never have and through the
language to gain a compre-
hension of different people and
a different way of thinking.”

A major observation of the
students was that the course
load was too cumbersome to

allow them to take full advan-
tage of their situation.

“Foreign study is demand-
ing in.every way,’’ says Mark
Rabil, ‘‘because you can’t
escape from studies—it’s ar-
ound you 24 hours a day.”

Dr. Kemp echoed this senti-
ment, “The students worked
hard. They never left the
subject they were studying...
they were totally immersed in
it in a very different way.

“In living with a Spanish
family, as well as having a
tutor their own age who did
many outside things outside
the tutorial with:them, al-
lowed the students to easily
submerge themselves into the
culture.”

“The only problem,”’ says
Rabil, ‘‘is that for the first
month you can’t always say
what you're thinking.”

Says Mark Rabil, ‘“‘It makes
you appreciate the fact that a
university or college is not the
only place to get an educa-
tion.”
