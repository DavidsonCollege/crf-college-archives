Student Registration
Attains Highest Peak

After all registrations were received
for the 1934-1935 session of the éollege,
it was revealed-that-the largest enroll-
ment in the ninety-eight years of the col-
lege’s existence had been received. A
statement from the registrar’s office an-
nounced that six hundred forty-nine stu-
dents are now enrolled and in school.

This number surpasses by two men
any former registration, the nearest be-
ing-in the 1931-1932 session when the
enrollment was six hundred forty-seven
This number, however,
included the second semester registra-
tion. Registrar Hengeveld estimates
that during the year we shall have about
six new men added to the student body,
basing his estimate on the incréase in
past years.

As yet, there are no figure the

tries. These will be announced in the
near future.
As usual, the freshman class is the

largest, with two hundred eight mem-
bers. The sizes of the respective classes
decrease according to years, the senior
class having the smallest enrollment
in the college at this time. The sopho-
more class is second with an enrollment
of one hundred seventy-five members,
the junior class next with one hundred

thirty-eight members, and the senior
class with one hundred twenty-eight
members.

Of the total enrollment of over six
hundred, there are two hundred forty-
three new men. There are thirty-five
transfers from other schools not in the
freshman class.

NEW FEATURE

“The Davidsonian” would like to
announce that in future issues of
the paper it is planning to publish
an “Open Forum” column on the
editorial page for the use and bene-
fit of the students.

This column will contain letters
and editorials concerning any phase
of campus life in which the student
may be interested. Any subscriber
of the paper is eligible to use this
space. All articles will be printed
which are deemed advisable to
print, and they should be placed in
the hands of the editor before four
o’clock each Monday.

The column was originated with
the idea in mind of making the
paper one that is truly “the voice
of the students”.

Tonight at nine o'clock will break the

of rushing season and will conclude a
week of ceaseless activity on the part of

men for their respective lodges.

A rushing season cut in half by a
faculty ruling was the feature of this
year’s program, resulting in a scramble
by the fraternities in an effort to get
appropriate’ dates with new men. More
competition than usual has been noted
this and many fraternities have
found themselves unable to become ac-
quainted with all prospects due to. the
short length of time.

The rushing season proper began on
September 12, Wednesday, although
most of the lodges were entertaining the
newcomers beginning Monday, Septem-
ber 10.) A highlight in the rushing pro-
gram was Saturday night when many
of the fraternities gave extensive dances,
banquets or house parties to entertain the
freshmen, Rushing ended Tuesday night
at ten o'clock with the beginning of the
Day of Silence.

Due to last minute changes in the
room assignments of those enrolled at
Davidson this year, the Davidsonian was
unable to print the Student Directory in

along with the directory of the faculty.

AND CAMPUS

Dormitories Are Repaired And
Painted, And Many Campus
Roads Paved

PLACE LAMPS IN ROOMS

Six hundred and forty-six students ar-
rived at Davidson September 12, to find
many changes and improvements on the
campus. Over $25,000 has been spent
by the college in improving the cam-
pus and repairing the buildings.

Probably the most appreciated and
noticeable improvement was the building
of new roads and walks. ‘The roads
have not been completed as yet, due to
the rainy weather which has prevailed
for the past several weeks. Plans are be-
ing made to put the finishing touch on
the roads sometime in the near future.

The roads under construction to be
hard-surfaced are the “D" road, roads
in the front and rear of the dormitories
and the drive leading to the stadium.
The “circle” in fraternity court is being
hard-surfaced also. Concrete walks were
aid from the Y. M. C. A. building to
the Post Office and walks to fraternity
court and to the
made of brick.

Much construction work been
done on the dormitories. Georgia, once
dilapidated, is now the best dormitory
on the hill. ‘New. floors, wall paper,
painting of the woodwork, installing of
new tables chairs, beds and chiffoniers
renovated Georgia dormitory. Russwin
automatic locks have been added in all
the rooms on the campus, thus increas-
ing the safety of the Davidson students.

One of the outstanding features of
this summer's work was the purchase
hy the college of 272 Iluminating Engi-
for each
dormitory room on the campus, causing
the Southern Public Utilities Magazine
to say, “Davidson is now the — best
lighted college in America.” The lamps
were made according to the specifica-
tion sent. in by Roy A, Palmef, illumi-
nating engineer for the [luminating En-
gineering Society, and are designed to
give indirect lighting to the student's
desk.

Kast, West and Watts received a new
coat of paint on the walls and wood-
work, ‘The floors were sanded and then
painted in’ Kast and West. The walls
were patched and other minor improve-
ments added, Rumple, having
been renovated summer before last, was
worked on very little. North and South

made in the general clean-up.

Dr. Sentelle Reveals
New Monitor Selection

The new monitors for this year as
given out by the dean's office Monday
are B. W. Wyche and A. A. Gammon,
monitors for the freshman class; P. F,
Warren and J. L. McClintock, monitors
for the sophomore class; H. A, Cathey,
junior class monitor, and C, F. Fort,
senior class monitor.

New rules regarding tardies and ab-
sences in church and chapel are also an-
nounced by Dr, Sentelle:

A man is tardy if he is not in his
chapel seat by the opening of the organ
prelude. He counted absent if he
comes in after the opening of the sec-
ond exercise, generally the
hymn.

At the morning church service a tardy
is incurred if a man is not in his seat
by the opening of the doxology, an
absence if he comes in after the sermon
has begun.

For retiring from either chapel
church a man is given an absence, Re-
tiring is either leaving the service or
moving from the seat assigned him.
