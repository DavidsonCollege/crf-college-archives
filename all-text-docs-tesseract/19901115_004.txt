What Is To Be Done?

These, my friends, are troub-
led times. Our government is
riddled with corruption on every
level. Our planet is slowly being
destroyed by land rapists and glut-
tons. Children are shooting each
other for their shoes. Our schools
are nothing less than a disgrace.
Our understanding of reasonable
health care is a rather sick joke.

I won’ tbother saying anything
about the Exxon Defence Squad
better known as the U.S. military.
Rocky V comes out this week.
Angela Lansbury still has her own

. show on network TV. The Family
Circus is read by thousands. Va-
nessa Redgrave keeps telling me
what living is. Racky V comes out
this week.

The college spent 17 or so
million dollars on anifty new gym,
and we don’t even have maid
service. Rocky V comes out this
week. Almost everyone I know
rides a bike or does some other
silly sort of exercise. More and
more people find smoking less than
socially acceptable. Helms won.
Worst of all, Rocky V comes out
this week.

What is to be done?

I havea few ideas about how to
make the world a better place, but
most of them are pretty personal
and involve several pounds of Jell-

O, a few albino kittens and Laurie
Partridge in something crotchless.
(But then Danny keeps coming in
with Shirley Jones in those God

awful bell bottoms, and well, it just
never seems. to work out).

Instead of boring
the hell out of ev-
eryone who pre-
tends to be your
friend, you can
vent your aggres-
sions in the Opin-
ions section.

Excuse the digression. Back
to our question: What is to be
done? Who knows? I mean if 4
gelatin swathed Laurie can’tcome
up with a decent solution, who on
earth can? You. (Yes, this is
turning into yet another pathetic
plea for people to write for The
Davidsonian).

Imagine the opportunity. In-
stead of boring the hell out of
everyone who pretends to be your
friends, you can vent your aggres-
sions in the Opinions section. Of
course we’re not going to print itif
it sucks, but we’ll at least read it.

Go ahead and express your-
self. Let loose about that which
annoys you, or that of which you
are particularly proud.

Tired of the conspiracy of con-

servatism on campus, or of the
liberal loud mouthing about con-
servative conspiracies? Write about
it. The potential for fame lies at
your feet, so write for The
Davidsonian. Please, we’re get-
ting a little desperate.

As of now (Sunday night at
10:30) all we have for Opinions
this week is my little blurb which
you’ ve almost finished reading, a
plea for vegetarian dining and some
silliness (which we’re not going to
print, as it happens to suck) from a
very odd woman in Oyster Bay
who seems to have combined all
the best tenets from the Summer of
Love and the McCarthy erain one.

I’m not kidding, she actually
wants us to join her in supporting
the establishment of November 14
as “I Love America Day”. (See
what we deal with up here?!)

In all seriousness, every sec-
tion (News, Sports, Features, and
Opinions) of our beloved paper
could use a boost in the participa-
tion department. Please be in touch
with any of the editors or associate
editors as named on the masthead
and tell us what you’d like to do.
We need your help.

Remember, The Davidsonian
is the paper for and of the entire
student body (i.e. it’s no longer
controlled by a self flattering re-
gime of dorks like it used to be).

, The new order wants your input, so
let’s have it. Call an editor, or our

office at 2148, today.

R.O.T.C. Cadet Pens Chagrin
Over Thoughts Of War |

By CINCINNATUS

ROTC aims to develop its
cadets into effective leaders. Being
an ROTC cadet in the present day,

‘the foremost question in my mind
is,’To where will I be asked to
lead?” In light of recentevents, “to
5 war” seems a realistic response.

If 1 were someone else I might
be terribly excited by the prospect
of going to war.

I might grab my gun and my
men and scream “Finally! We get
to fight!”

The simple fact is, and I think
I speak for many other cadets at
Davidson, I don’t want war.

tion I have received at Davidson, I
bringalotinto question that! wo:
otherwise overlook.

I’ve learned to think before I
act, and have come to value
sistency between my beliefs and

my actions. I fear the day when I »

am asked to act, despite my be-
liefs.

The current Middle Eastcrisis con-
cerns all of us at Davidson.

As an ROTC cadet, thoughts
of an impending war weigh all the
more on my mind. When] first
chose to participate in the ROTC
program at Davidson our govern-
ment leaders were forecasting cuts
in military spending in response to
Perestroika and the welcomed
thawing of the Cold War.

Not long after we had begun to
deflate the “military balloon,” a
certain Saddam Hussein startled
our leaders into blowing air into
the balloon once again.

The simple fact is,

’ not add to the sentiment for war,

and I think I speak
for many other
cadets at Davidson,
I don't want war.

I’m scared of having to lead
people into a situation I don’t fully
understand or even wholly agree
with. "

Much due to the type .educa-

Enjoy A Vegetarian
Thanksgiving

As Thanksgiving and Christ-
mas approach with alarming speed,
most people’s mouths water in
anticipation of a home-cooked,
round, juicy, Butterball turkey or
sumptuously prepared leg of lamb.
Visions of giblet gravy, pork bread
stuffing, and blood pudding dance
in their heads. But for some, holi-
day dinners instill anxiety.

“How can I turn down
Grandma’s lovingly prepared
honey-roasted ham? What about
Uncle Bob’s famous fried
chicken?” we ask ourselves. For

most of you out there, these ques- .

tions never raise their ugly visages
and probably never will. .

In fact, you don’ treally give a
damn. You eat meat, and do so
comfortably and withrelish. Vege-
tarianism is a far-out hippie thing
that went out of style with bell-
bottoms and love beads. That is
fine with us, but for those who are
also struggling with their first
meatless holidays we offer an Al-
ternative Thanksgiving.

Scenario 1: “Hey mom, you
know how you and dad always
complain about not getting enough
help in the kitchen while we’re out
visiting with high school friends?
Yeah, well guess what! I'll do all
the cooking if you’ll agree to one
teensy condition! NO MEAT!!”
At this point, whip out one of the
multitudinous. Vegetarian cook-
books and elbow your way up to
the oven.

Your parents will be so glad
that they get to actually watch the
owl games that they’ll be fairly
easily convinced.

Scenario 2: “No, Grandma,
vegetarianism is not a disease.
Don’t worry, even though I won’t
be ‘getting better,” it’s not, conta-
gious. No, it’s not that I don’tlike

your cooking, I just. can’t-enjoy..-

your leg of lamb after that day I
spent at the petting zoo.” At this

point, hand her some tofu and
remind her of how much everyone
has always hated leftover turkey
sandwiches.

’ Scenario 3: You were unable
to stop the preparations, and must
face a table full of ‘traditional’
dishes. Stop, take a deep breath,
and ask for the mashed potatoes,
yams, peas, and rolls. Fill your .
plate, smile sweetly, and enjoy.

When your dad challenges you
to munch down on a meal fit for a
starving college student, tell him
you’re experimenting with new
diets and to be happy you’re ovo-
lacto. In the puzzled silence fol-
lowing your announcement, dig
in.

Remember the spit-
it-in-your-napkin
maneuver you
practiced in the
third grade? Try
that...

Above all, keep a sense of
humor about it. If your mother
runs sobbing fromthe table or your
father stares in total disbelief. atthe
Liberal values you brought home
from college, do what your con-
science tells you.

Nobody is taking notes, and if
one bite of bird flesh will save a
twenty-yearrelationship, hold your
nose and wash it down with a big
gulp of the nearest liquid. .

napkin maneuver you practiced in _
the third grade? Try.that,or station

join ROTC.
My participation, I trust, does

and perhaps may positively influ-
ence future conditions as my posi-
tion in the Army changes.

All said, my enthusiasm for ~

the program is as strong as
ever...but so is my insistence not
to be shoved into a corner and
classified “‘Militarily Motivated:
Eager for War.”

Isee what’s going on with more:

sensitivity than that...and perhaps
worry more than you.
