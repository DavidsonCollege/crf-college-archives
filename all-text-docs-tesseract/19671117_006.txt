perspective.”

John Bolinger, freshman: “I don’t f y .

‘think the freshman class has lost much
of the spirit it had when it came.
Those that have lost spirit have done
so because of the example of upper

Dan Gresham, senior: ‘I think they
definitely do as far. as to the school.
It is doubtful if they do in relation to
academics. It's the “nature of the
school—it is so sechuded and out of
fouch that people just get tired of it.”

Calvin Murphy, sophomore: “I don't
think they do. As a freshman I could-
n't afford to become apathetic toward
studies. An appearance of apathy is
more a settling down into a rut typi-
eal of Davidson.”

“The intentional setting of
a fire in any building on
campus will be considered an
extreme case, and conviction
for such an offense will usu-
ally result in suspension for
no. less than one semester.”

The. proposed rule stems
from a flurry of fires in the
dormitories reported to the
Student Life Committee by
Mrs. Peter Nicholls. director
of student housing.

Student Council President
Tom Earnhardt expressed his
opinion that the previous rule
was much too lax and David-
son “ought to bring their
standards about fire up to
those of other schools."’

Bill Watson suggested that
the rule be added to the Stu-
dent Council ByLaws, which
requires only council approv
al.

Mike May said he thought
such a major change ought
to be submitted for student
body approval. He said this
method “‘would give the stu-
dents fair warning.”

Movie Proves I[t--
War Game Is Hell

ED. NOTE: Following is a
veview of “The War
Game,” a 47-minute movie
shown last night in Love
Auditorium.

By BILL SPENCER
Staff Writer

Last night at least 700 peo-
ple witnessed possible scenes
from World War HI. “The
War Game" showed more
blood than inspiration, but
it did succeed in proving, for
any who needed proof, that
war is indeed hell.

The movie, set in Britain.
opened with scenes of prep.
aration for a bomb attack.
This was followed by an ef-
fective use. of counterpoint
illustrating the ignorance of
the British and Americans in
regard to nuclear war. This
involved a series of scenes
in which British people could
not answer such questions as

Laundry Changes
Policy For Sheets

C. W. Stacks, manager of
the College Laundry, has an-
nounced a new policy for stu-
dents’ exchanging sheets and
and pillow cases.

_, Under the new system.
sheets and pillow cases will
be issued on an exchange ba-
sis only. A linen room has
been opened in the Jaundry
for this purpose and will be
open from 7 a.m. lo 4 p.m.
every Monday and Thursday.
Stacks said that the new
system had to be implement-
ed because the Jaundry was
losing too many sheets.
“We've just got to have a

little better control,’" he said.
