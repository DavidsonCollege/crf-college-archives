Class Of ’63 Unites F

Gentiemen Disabled
In Battle For Belk

By BOB BRADFORD

Davidsonian Feature Writer
10:15 p.m. Monday, October 5—a review, a paper
and a writ on my docket for the next day—the din
rioting freshmen in the background as I hovered over
my typewriter—suddenly, unexpectediy, even the - fev
remaining eggheads still studying were forced to stop
work as total darkness enveloped the campus.
The class of 63 had rioted, a ferocious battle, no holds bar
as freshmen classes have rioted red, ensued. Fists and trash
for years, but never with such cans full of water were the pri

fervor. A maze of students mary weapons. The darkne
gathered on the front lawn of lessened only slightly by caf
Belk, an open space of tension and flashlights, led to the gen

driving the throng into two op-
posing parties. The freshmen
sought to storm Belk, but the
upperclassmen, anticipating
their action, stood ready to de-
fend their homes against the
invaders.

Boyd, Gillis Get
Burlington Awards

Burlington Industries
has awarded two scholar-
to Davidson under its
to-Education Program
for the 1959-60 school year,
according to an announce-
ment from President D.
Grier Martin.

Quinton Boyd, junior from
Porterdale, Ga., and David Gil-
lis, senior from Mount Olive,
N. C., have been chosen by the
college to receive this year’s
awards. Each Burlington Schol-
ar receives the scholarship at
the beginning of his junior
year and customarily holds it
for two years. Gillis was picked
last year as a junior under the
same program.

Burlington industries be-
gan its aid-to-education pro-
gram at Davidson during the
1955-56 college year.

This grant is made in recog-
nition of the fact that student
fees at private colleges finance

eral confusion.

The freshmen were continu:
ally doused by water issuing
from the second, third, and
fourth floors of Belk. Many up
perclassmen from other dorms
locked horns with freshmen ou®
on the lawn and terrace, wat
ing down the number of fresh-

men who eventually did man-
age to make it to the door. |

Each time a freshman fought}
his way up to the door of Belk
and was ready to claim his vic-
tory, he was grabbed by hands
within the lobby of the dormi-
tory, taken to one of the first
floor rooms, roughed up a bit
by some of the upper class
bruisers, stripped, and thrown
back out into the crowd.

FRESHMAN FEINT

The freshmen dropped back
then, and it appeared that they
were going to punt when sud-
denly they rushed one of the
other Belk doors which was
held slightly ajar by several
of the taunting upperclassmen.
Some of the freshmen managed
to get a foot inthe door but
were quickly ushered out by
approaching upperclassmen.

Shortly afterwards, the lights

“Mr. Hengeveld, using a weighed, making use of all the
formula, figures out a predict-
ed average that the prospective
student should make in his four
years at Davidson. Incidentally,
the results of this formula have
shown that it is highly accurate
within a certain range.

“Using the results of the
formula, we place the candi-
date for admission in one of
three classes: a high group,
a middle group, or a low
“Mr. Hengeveld then examies
personally the complete record
of all the boys in the top
group; their recommendations,
extracurricular activities, ath-
letics, church work, and so
forth.

“If he is ‘satisfied that the
boy will be an asset to David-
son and should be admitted, he
sends the folder to me. If I
am satisfied, tle boy is admit-
ted. This was not our idea, but
was recommended by the com-
mittee to expedite the process.
“The boys in the lowest

group are automatically
dropped unless they have

material in the folder.

“From this process a score
is obtained on every boy. This
score, along with the formula
rating, determines whether a
boy in the middle group will
be admitted or not.

“Some of us felt that the
formula was carrying too
much weight, so we doubled
the weight of the commit
tee’s rating. Last year the
rating of the committee
weighed 55%, the formula,
45%.

“There were a number of
cases brought up last year that,
we decided, could not be ade-
quately covered by the formu-
la. These included, for exam-
ple, some prep school boys, and
some boys from very small
high schools.

“Since we felt that these
boys were not getting a fair
deal by the regular system, we
decided on them in other ways.
These new methods were some-
what arbitrary, sometimes con-
sisting of a special rating that
we believed more accurate.

“The number handled by
these special methods was
small, probably between five
and ten, but these special
methods are a recognition
that the regular formula can-
not handle all cases.”
