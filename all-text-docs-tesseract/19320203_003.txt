Knowin’! It seems that whenever a lean year

of

in some phase of sports rolls around, he is given
the dirty reins of the somewhat rickety old shay |
and asked to drive it over the

tape line in a |

blaze of glory.

It doesn’t require particularly much genius
to produce a winning team from the cream
of the crop, but a bit more than an iron
hand and quite a bit of ingenuity is neces-
sary to get blood from a turnip. The days of |
“P. I.” Pritchetts, Biil Goodsons, and Doc |
Mathises seem to be in the distant past. Doc |
is still with us and performing in his usually
brilliant manner, but it takes five men to
make a winning team—no less, and prefer- |
ably a few more. |

isn’t so bad, but in basketball its co-operation
which heads the list of factors necessary for
a winning team. And next to co-operation,
the ability to shoot goals should be consid-
ered. It seems disheartening to watch a team |
work a perfect play and then miss a crip |
shot. Just so with long shots. It seems to be
absolutely essential that co-ordination and |
shooting ability be linked together, a situa- |
tion which has taken place very rarely thus |

far this season on the Davidson five.

Still, we're not growlin’. Just as people have |
their ups and downs, so does the sports world.

victory by ringing down a score of 23-21. It

was Henry Fort, who played a white-hot game.
