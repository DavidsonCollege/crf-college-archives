in the rewritten definition. The
revision combines the two ideo-
logical viewpoints in a statement
with guidelines to replace the old
standards in the College Gover-
nance of Regulations and Proce-
dures found in the Davidson Stu-
dent Handbook.

According to Dean of Students
Will Terry, the revised definition
will be “widely distributed” to the
entire student body and printed in
the 1994-95 Student Handbook.
Effective immediately after the
second vote by the Student Con-
duct Council, all faculty and stu-
dents will adhere to the newly clari-
fied definition and guidelines of
“dishonest representation.”

The Debate

The major discrepancy in the
debate was the question of intent
and its relation to plagiarism. For
some faculty members, any mis-
representation of someone’s work
constitutes plagiarism--intent not
being the distinguishing charac-
teristic.

However, for others, intent is
precisely what separates an honest

key to plagiarism in revised policy

mistake from plagiarism.

According to English profes-
sor Cynthia Lewis, who was in-
vited to the Council as a faculty
consultant, any misrepresentation
of work is plagiarism. Whether or
not a student has taken the time to
learn the guidelines and bound-
aries of documentation in a paper
is not the question; it is still plagia-
rism, she says.

If a student uses direct mate-
rial without the use of direct quotes
and citations or paraphrases with-
out attribution, it is “plagiarism by
default,” says Lewis.

Students who plead ignorance
to the charges of plagiarism claim
they do not know how to properly
document work that is not their
own. According to Lewis, this still
constitutes a violation of the rules

of writing.
Lewis remarks that in the past,
serious “irregularities” in a

student’s documentation were re-
ported to the Dean of Students and
then the student was brought be-
fore the Honor Council for plagia-
rism.

According to English profes-
sor Gill Holland, the definition of

plagiarism does not include all
types of faulty documentation. He
believes the term should be saved
for those cases where misleading
documentation is used by the writer
with the intent to deceive the reader.
For Holland, this separates “hon-
est mistakes from dishonest mis-
takes.”

If proper credit is not given in
a paper, it is up to the professor to
distinguish whether or not there
was the intention to deceive, says
Holland. An error in attribution,
done without intention by many
students, is not an honor violation
and should not be brought before
the Honor Council, according to
Holland.

“Proper attribution of sources
can be very tricky and it is easy to
make an honest mistake,” he con-
tinues.

“Intent is the crucial factor.”
Holland refers to Chris Baldick’s
The Concise Oxford Dictionary of
Literary Terms where it says pla-
giarism is “usually distinguished
by its dishonest intention.”

The Compromise

As written for the Student

Handbook, intention on the part of

the student is what distinguishes
plagiarism. The revision refers to
plagiarism as “dishonest represen-
tation.” Later inthe definition, itis
made clear that all Davidson stu-
dents should be “thoroughly fa-
miliar with methods for document-
ing the use of another person’s
sentences, arguments and ideas.”
Dean Terry comments, “I feel
good about it; it is simpler than the
old definition.” The new state-
ment will give more responsibility
to the professors for “discovering
and ferreting out plagiarism.”

Terry states that fall sessions
for freshman will teach the rules
and regulations of documentation.

According to Lewis, there is
now more room for judgment; pro-
fessors can decide whether or not
the student plagiarized. Says
Lewis, this will “help the profes-
sors” in that they will have “more
academic control.”

Holland believes the clarifi-
cation of the definition will be a
great relief for faculty, students,
and the Honor Council. However,
he confesses that, for him, there
has been no ambiguity in the term.

post unofficial assignments on Feb.
23.

Students who do not receive
an apartment will be forced to shift
their group numbers to fit the type
of apartments that are available.
Once again, students are allowed
to apply for only one type of apart-
ment, a 4- or 5-person, not both.

In Phase II of the selection
process, apartment applications are
due on March 15. In this phase,
rising juniors will also be allowed
to apply for apartments. The re-
maining apartment assignments
will be posted on March 16.

The off-campus option

To avoid the complexities of
the apartment process, some stu-
dents may choose to live off-cam-
pus. Rising seniors may apply to
do so during Phase I of the housing
process. In Phase II, both rising
juniors and seniors may apply for
off-campus status.

For the first time, in order to
receive off-campus permission,
students must attend a meeting at
Davidson Town Hallas an orienta-
tion for living in the Davidson com-
munity.

Students will be granted per-
mission to live off-campus in lot-
tery number order. The number of
students allowed permission tolive

off-campus depends on several fac-
tors, such as the number of pre-
dicted freshmen, and the number
of students leaving to travel abroad
in the fall. Essentially, RLO wants
to ensure that its rooms will be
filled.

The single room option

Phases I and II of the lottery
process only include on-campus
apartments and off-campus appli-
cations. In Phase III of the lottery
process, students may apply for
single room vacancies.

Asingle room may bea viable
option for seniors who may have
been left out of a 5-person apart-
ment group that did not receive a
suite. However, many singles may

already be occupied by Resident

Advisors or students with special

medical needs. Single room appli-

cations are due on March 29.
The clustering policy

Although apartment selections
occur earlier this year than last
year, double room selections oc-
cur at the same time. Women will
choose rooms on April 6 and the
men will choose their rooms on
April 7. Both sessions last from
6:30 to 10 p.m.

RLO hopes that those nights
will run smoothly with the aid of a
simplified clustering policy. Like
last year, clusters will be allowed,
but only for two rooms. Clusters’
positions in the lottery lines are

determined by adding the fournum-
bers and dividing by two. The
reduced clustering allows RLO to
more effectively monitor frater-
nity and eating house numbers on
halls. No more than 40% of a male
hall can belong to one fraternity;
no more than 50% of a female hall
can belong to one eating house.

Room retention policy

This year, students will not be
allowed to retain their current
rooms for next year. Formerly,
certain rooms were designated so
that upperclassmen could keep
their rooms for the next year. In its
overhaul of the lottery process,
RLO eliminated this option.

Sophomore Chad Richardson.

expresses his disappointment that
he will not be able to retain his
large room in Duke by saying,
“that’s horrible.”
Loft elimination

For the first year, no home-
made lofts will be allowed in any
dorm. This year, Sentelle has been
the only dorm with such lofts al-
lowed. This policy helps eliminate

i} room damage caused by students’

constructions.

When a student chooses their
room for next year, they will auto-
matically receive a specific type of
bed assignment that has been stan-
dardized by RLO. Students must
leave the bed assigned to their room
in that room.

Information sessions

The Residence Life Office is
trying to avoid student confusion
by offering two sessions to help
clear up confusion about the new
policies. Students are encouraged
to attend and ask questions.

Freshmen are required to at-
tend “Lottery 101: A Novice’s
Guide to Getting a Room” on
March 1 in Love Auditorium. The
meeting will last from 7-8 p.m.

For upperclassmen, an op-
tional information session will be
held on January 31. “Lottery 201:
Advanced Rooming Strategy” will
be held from 7-8 p.m. in the Multi-
Purpose Room in Chambers. ~
