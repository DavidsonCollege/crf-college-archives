The DAVIDSONIAN, March, 19 1919

YES SHE DOES—BUT
WAIT, NO SHE DON’T!

The Bible classes last Sunday had to
run more or less on their reputation.
The fellows seemed to have been unable
to catch up as yet with those hours of
sleep lost on account of that memorable
event, Junior Speaking. And. say. old
Georgia led the crowd! Yes, 17 were
out in her honor, and for once the Geor-
gians may boast that they were the most
faithful in attendance. Of course you
guys that slept need not appropriate any
of the credit. Hey, whoa! Not so fast!
Here's where an oversight was made.

Rumple led with 18—my mistake. Beg
your pardon, Rumpleites, Watts had
t4, Chanibers, South End. had 16:

North Extremity had 13. On the whole
it was rather small, but let's hope more
fellows can be awakened, literally and
figuratively, for next Sunday.
The Sunday schools had 15
present and an attendance of 183.

MR. BRANSCOMBE HELPS
SETTLE JOB PROBLEM

The World Forum meeting last
Thursday evening was both interesting
and instructive. Mr. Branscombe, from
the Southern headquarters of the Y. M.
C. A.. discussed a question of vital im-
portance to every college fellow—What
shall my life-work be?

Mr. Branscimbe showed how impor-
tant this question is to us, and of what
great consequence it is for our success or
failure in life. He then pointed out five
considerations which should guide us in
choosing our life work: First. we should
try to find what appeals to us, what we
really love to do. Second, we should
seek that life-work in which we could be
of mast service. That life which serves
most is most sacred. Taken in this
light, our life work, in whatever line it
may be, should be sacred to us.” Third,
we should choose a job that is bigger
than we are now and grow. to it. We
cannot grow in our work if it is not big-
yer than we are. Fourth, we should seck
that work in which we can mean most.
No man should be satisfied with work
that does not offer the opportunity for
his biggest service to his fellow man,
Fifth, we should seck that task which the
world most needs done. In this task we
will be happy, for this work is consecrat-
ed to Christ's service. We saw some of
the great needs in the ministry and the
great challenge of its call.

There were about 40 fellows out for
the meeting. Every one of them enjoyed
the talk and derived much benefit from
it.

PRACTICE GAME PLAYED
WITH TEAM FROM TOWN

Coach Fetzer is gradually’ getting his
nine-into shape. Last Saturday the first
scrub game was played against the town,
the game ending in a 3-3 tic. Everyone
showed up well.

The job of twirling is contested for by
Clarke, Curry, Murray and Miley.
“Railroad” Clarke seems to be the best
of the four. “Cop” Johnson and “Red”
Sullivan are fighting it out for the place
behind the bat. First-base is being held
down by McArn, but “Pig Iron” Sutton
is playing well in spite of a bad eye.
Ratchford, at second, and Boswell. at
short. are playing like veterans. Third
is being taken care of by Sample and
Cassell. Out in the field, Spann, Miley
and Richards are doing fine work. There
is some good material among the scrubs
also. “Red” Miley, “Rooster” McFad-
den. Pat Robson and Montgomery are
showing up especially well.

It’s a trifle late now, but it would
have been nice if after we sing The Star-
Spangled Banner, everybody recited the
Monroe doctrine in chorus.

ONLY IN DREAMS.

(Being a tale of things as they ought
to be.)

“The general handed out. furloughs,
Reports were a thing of the past.
Maxes- lay round like Piedmont -butts.
Holidays came thick and fast.

There was real ice cream in the mess-
hall,

Growly had flown away,

Pie came to the table in relays

Roast: turkey was served once a day.

Penalty tours were abandoned,
The voice of the sentinel ceased.
Lates were regarded as honors,
Suspensions of duty increased.

The last notes of reveille faded.

The Keydet sprang from his hay.
Rubbed with his hands those sleepy eves,
And frightened his dream away,

—s.

AS ‘TIMES CHANGE.

A doughboy was sitting. pensively in
a field while shells from our guns were
roaring overhead like invisible inid-air
express trains, and while, less noisy, but
more disturbing. the shells fram the
German guns were ending with a wail
and burst all about.

“What are vou thinking about, Bud-
dy?) Making your will? Are you won-
dering why you were ever nut enough
to enlist 2” some one asked him.

- “No,” said the doughboy, gloomily.
“T was wondering how [ was ever nut
enough to tet a man hold me up in Chi-
cago last spring. He only had a,.32."—
