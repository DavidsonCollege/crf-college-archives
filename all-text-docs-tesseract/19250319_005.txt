THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 19, 1925

Five Members Chosen

by Alpha Phi Epsilon

Chapter at Davidson

Local Professor and Men of Sopho- |
more and Junior Classes Honored

The Phi Chapter of Alpha Phi Epsilon,
the national honorary forensic fraternity
at Davidson, has made the following
elections from members of the student
body and faculty this year; from the ris-
ing Junior class: C. W. Williams, L. D.
Wharton and D. H. Stewart; H. L. Shaw
from the Junior class;
ulty, Prof. Carl Wachter.

The initiations were held at the meet-
ing last Thursday night, March 12.

The membership, which is limited to
Juniors and Seniors among the student
body, consisted,

<

tion, of eleven student members and
three of the faculty.
The fraternity was founded at the

University of Alabama some years ago
and today has over twenty chapters
throughout the country. It is the lead-

ing national debating fraternity in the
United States.
The Phi chapter at Davidson, which

was formerly the Gavel and Forum Club, |
petitioned and received its charter in the |

fall of ’23 and since that time has prov-
ed itself to be a useful and honored or-
ganization on the Davidson campus.
The primary object of the fraternity is
to promote debating and public speak-
ing. The chapter here has done some
excellent work among the literary soci-

ties and various organizations on the
Hill.
Notable among the accomplishments

of the fraternity at Davidson last year
was the introduction of the Congression-
al method of debating into the several
literary societies here.

INTEREST GROWS IN WORLD.|
WIDE DISCUSSION GROUPS

The world problem di discussion groups, |
fostered by the Y. M. C. A., are being

than usual. As no set course is being
given this term a list of approximately
forty problems were submitted to the
leaders, who chose. six problems to be!
discussed during the six weeks of meet-
ings.

For the last three weeks on each|
Wednesday night these groups have been
meeting. There are twenty-six leaders,
each being assigned a floor in one of the
dormitories. The leader decides on the
room in which the meeting will be held

report that interest in these groups is
growing with each meeting.

The problem for discussion on March
11 was Why is Christianity the only reli-
gion that will maintain world peace? In
the discussion of this problem many new
thoughts were brought out. The object
of these groups is to get every man to
take part in the discussion and get a
broader vision of world problems.

These meetings will be held on
Wednesday nights forthe next three
weeks at nine-thirty.

The leaders are: L. M. McCutcheon,
D. H. Stewart, W. A. Christian, E. P.

debate on the question, Should manufacturers

| ford, upholding the affirmative, won the de-
| bate. A general discussion over the question
of introducing parliamentary procedure for a
time terminated in disfavor of the project.
