Old Demon Rum got his dese}:
the Eumenean Society last Saturday
nght. The subject for debate was. ‘Re-
solved, “That the manufacture of alco-
holic beverages from grain and grain
products should he discontinued for the
duration of the war.” The affirmative
of the question was represented by Byrd
and ‘Thomas, the negative by Orgain and
Frierson. The affirmative opened with
a broadside of time-honored prohibition
arguments, and followed these by the
contention that this was not only a moral
issue, but also an economic issue that at
this moment was of vital impdrtance.
The negative replied that it was imprac-
ticable; that it would result in loss of
employment to many people and of much
revenue to the goverment. “Thev
showed. further, that only a. small per
cent of the grain was used in the manu-
facture of alcoholic beverages.. Vhev
contended that prohibition was an en-
croachment upon individual rights, and
that this was an inopportune time for
the enactment of such a law. The
idges encouraged the negative by de
ciding in their. favor. The house voted
in favor of the affirmative.

With a larger enroilment than last
vear, the Fumenean Freshman Society
has bright prospects. The first meeting
was held Monday night. ‘September 24.
at which time eighteen men presented
themselves for membership. “Phis is es-
pecially encouraging in the face of the
reduced enrollment in college.

The first regular meeting was held
Monday night, October 1. Ar this time
a debate was given, Boulware, Brumby.
Forgey and Harwell representing the
affirmative, and Cumming. Mitchell,
Burgess and Collins the negative. “Che
subject was the same as that of the regu-
lar societies, All the men spoke excel-
lently for their first appearance in so-
ciety. From the present outlook. the
Fresh Society promises much.

At the regular meeting of the Philan-
thropic Society Saturday night. the affir-
mative was upheld by “Fremain and W.
F. Hall. who argued: (1) That intoxi-
cants are injurious to health; (2) that
United States and her allies need the
grain products for food; (3) that the
nation needs the men in more useful em-
ployment. The negative was defended
by Foscue and H. T. Lilly. who con-
tended: (1) That it is not fair for the
government to confiscate private prop-
erty: (2) that 99 per cent. of the grain
used is not fit for food—this was the
strongest argument brought out during
the debate; (3) they further argued
that the government could not afford to
lose the revenue obtained by taxing the
liquor interests. The decision committee
decided in favor of the negative.
