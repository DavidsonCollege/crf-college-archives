Novel Sensation for Junior Speaking.
Rise in time for lunch,

Retire before breakfast.

Recognize the chaperone,

Fall in love with some one else’s girl.

Members of the student body please
remember during Junior Speaking:

1. A kiss works wonders.
Love is blind,
Beginners’ luck is the best luck.
It pays to advertise.
Work for the night is coming
What you know won't hurt you.
He who hesitates is lost.

VOLUNTEER BAND HEARS OF
THE GREENSBORO CON-
FERENCE
At the Volunteer Band last Sunday
morning it was a great treat to hear re-
ports from the Greensboro Conference.
All who were present at the meeting will
testify that the delegates brought back
some of the wonderful spirit of the state
nieeting. Talks were given by various
ones in the band, also by others, who
are not volunteers, but who are earnest
supporters of the movement. Each of
these talks bore testimony to the fact
that this was a wonderfully successful

gathering of the State Volunteers.

Talking on the value of the confer-
ence, Guy Weeks told in an interesting
manner how enjoyable it was to gather
at these meetings and mix and mingle
with other volunteers, how important to
get together and draw up plans which
can be promoted through the. confer-
ence, and how, through the spirit ‘of
state conferences, weaker bands are
strengthened.

Bitzer, in describing the spirit, said
that this was distinctive above other
conferences in that it was not only
larger but flooded with more of the vol-
unteer spirit.

“The Evangelization of the World in
this Generation,” the motto of the vol-
unteer movement,4Was according to Bak-
er most appealing to him. He also as-
serted that through such spirit and en-
thusiasm as was shown in the conference
the world would be reached in this gen-
cration,

Ray Doubles, who attended the con-
ference, though not a volunteer, said he
went to Greensboro to get that reconse-
cration which he did not believe he
could get. elsewhere and to enjoy the
spirit of the volunteer movement, In
this, he declared, he was by no means
disappointed.

The greatest thing that Henry Patter-
son got out of the conftrence was the
strengthening of his life purpose, be-
sides realizing more fully the reality of
Christ through the spirit of prayer
which pervaded the entire meeting. It
was not so much the speakers that he
enjoyed, but the feeling that God
spoke through them.

McBride asserted that the greatest im-
pression which he received was the de-
termined resolution of all to return to
their respective colleges and start anew
to witness for Christ.

Victor Hoye, in giving his impression,
said that being a new volunteer, he was
surprised to find so many volunteers in
the state. The spirit of pred which
gripped every volunteer, as they gath-
ered in prayer groups from time to time,
was the greatest feature to him.

The fires of interest and enthusiasm
were kindled anew by reason of the
Greensboro Conference and it is hoped
that these fires will not burn low during
the coming year, but will burn more and
more brightly on Davidson campus.
