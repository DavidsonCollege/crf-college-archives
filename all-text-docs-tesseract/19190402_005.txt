SPRUNT FIELD SCENE
OF MUCH EXCITEMENT

Probably not since the days when
Adam was a bachelor has the Sprunt
Athletic Field been the scene of such
active activities as was the case last
Thursday afternoon. Around the dia-
mond were scattered the coming Hans
Wagners and the embryo Ty Cobbs,
while dashing up and down the track
were the fleet-footed sons of Mercury.
Just as A. F. Fricker, the champion
long-distance man of seventeen counties,
was finishing his twenty-first lap. his
_ whirlwind passage frightened from its
lair a member of the specie lepus sylva-
ticus, commonly known as cotton-tail or
grave-yard rabbit. The track team im-
mediately started after it in full force,
closely pursuing it around the track, and
were joined by all the chasers of the
elusive pill.

“Cop” Johnson, seeing this reminder
of his home in the wilds of Clayton.
gave vent to one of his famous rabbit
hound yodels and struck out after the
hare. This so frightened the varmint
that it overlooked the means of exit of-
fered by the gate and led the whole
swarm at a hot gait around the cinder
path. Here it courted danger in the
shape of “Pee Wee” Ratchford, who
showed that he was reared ‘far from the
madding crowd” by giving a fine exhibi-
tion of how bunnies are pursued down
in the Palmetto State.

Altho closely pressed, the rabbit kept
its wits about him, and while hopelessly
outnumbered, was apparently more than
a match for the crowd as far as “‘head-
work” was concerned, for after much
doubling and dodging he slipped thru
them and under the fence, lighting a raz
for the negro planting reservation to the
north of the field.

EXCELLENT WAR HISTORIES
RECEIVED BY LIBRARY

“The Current History of the Euro-
pean War” is the latest and one of the
_ most valuable additions to the library.
It is a collection of. the best articles on
the causes, operations and results of the
war, by the best thinkers of the day.
The New York times has ably assembled
these volumes, each covering three
months of war activities. Every volume
has a complete alphabetical index of ar-
ticles, writers, illustrations, maps ard
diagrams. In addition there are numer-
ous full plate illustrations from the best
official war photographers and several
characteristic sketches of the great men
in world affairs.

The Library also received this week a
more condensed history of the world
war, by Frank H. Simonds. Three of
the five volumes of this history are in the
Library now and the final two volumes
are to be added when released by the
publishers.

DIAMOND DUST.

Spann’s single in the ninth prevented
the Wildcats from having a hitless day.

For information as to how to pull a
double play “unassisted,” see Ratchford.

Better look out for Currie and Clark.
They are extremely wild at times. Never
mind this, though, for it is only tem-
porary. They are going to make a
“nifty” pair of college twirlers.

‘Johnny Richards started one Saturday
that looked good for two bases, but a
fine stop by the Phillies’ second-sacker
robbed him of it.

Since the game with the Phillies all
Davidson players are anxiously waiting
to see if Jack Coombs will offer them a
contract.

While “Dug” McArn was at the bat,
a feminine voice in the grandstand was
heard to say: “Cut out the Hoola,
Hoola, kid, and swat the pill.”

“Cop” Johnson had quite a puzzle on

his chest in the form of a breast pro-
tector. This probably encouraged him
in his peg to center field.

A thing almost too good to be true
nearly happened in the eighth inning
when the umpire was almost knocked out
of the box.

“Crabby” Cravath, judging from his
flow of language when soaked in the ribs
by one of Currie’s fast shoots, has been

rightly dubbed.
