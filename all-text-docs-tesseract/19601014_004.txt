Barium Springs Obtains
Teachers From YMCA

By ED RUDERT
Davidsonian Feature Writer

For the second straight year. the YMCA is sending seven students each week to
Barium Springs Orphanage to teach Sunday school classes. Every Sunday morning

one of the two alternate crews goes to the Presbyterian sponsored

teach seven of the twenty Sunday school classes.

The two hundred children at
Barium Springs make up al-
most the entire membership of
Little Joe's Church at Barium.
The limited number of adults
outside the orphanage.staff can-
not adequately handle all of the
Sunday school classes, and they
prefer not to have the teachers
and bousemothers who are with
the children all week also teach
their Sunday school lessons.

The fourteen sophomores,
juniors, and seniors from
Davidson teach classes which
range from fourth graders to
senior high school students.

Bob Rea, head of this particu-
lar “Y" project. commented
that the interest shown by Dav-
idson students has been very:
good. “Twenty five applied,
and of course we can use only
fourteen. We are keeping
some on reserve as substitutes.
Right now we're only using up-
perclassmen, but we hope to
work some freshmen in later.”

that the Westminster Fellow-
ship is initiating a program this
year to teach Negro Sunday
School] classes in this area, “I
hope some of these volunteers
can take part in this project,”
he said.

Or. George 5. Staples,
College Chaplain, commended
the interest shown by the
fourteen students. “I think
it’s one of those projects, like
so many of the things the Y
workers do, that hes a two:
way benefit.

“The kids at the orphanage
get to know college-age men
whom they wouldn’t get the op-
portunity to be with otherwise.
It is also a real medium of ser-
vice for the Davidson students
taking part. In no sense of the
word is this a manufactured
project just to keep the boys
busy.”

Rea commended the attitude
of the boys taking part in the
program. “They seem to feel
that they are really getting a
chance to do something for
other people. There are some
sacrifices involved in getting

"They always seem to come

there was a class without a

“The kids at Barium Springs

with a smile. “It's really a kind
of heartwarming sight to see
all those kids come running up

Viennese Opera: Pride
Of The Austrian Capital

By WOLFGANG MAYERHOFER

Richardson Scholer

Editor’s Note: This is the fourth in s series of articles written by exchange students on cus-

| toms or characteristics of their homelands, or on their impressions of Davidson College.

The people of Vienna have set their hearts on the Viennese Opera more than

on anything else in their city. When the opera was bombed and burned out dur-

ing the war, it hit everybody. But immediately after the war we began to reconstruct
it, even before we rebuilt our houses.

This reconstruction of the
Opera costs us millinns of schil-
lings which were paid out of
our city taxes. And although it
has been statistically proved
that three fourths of the Vien-
nese have never seen their
Opera from inside, nobody com-
plained about spending so
much money.

Finally in 1955 — the year
when Austria became a free
and independent country
again — we could reopen our
Opera. ! do not exaggerate

What makes people love their
Opera so much that you can
find headlines on the front page
of the newspapers about it?
With its approximately 2500
seats, it is not the biggest one.
The acoustics are not perfect.
The Mailaender Scala, it is said
has better singers. The only
thing which is really superior
is the Wiener Philharmonic Or-
chestra.

The Viennese Opera is uni-
que in the world because of its
spirit — the spirit of the en-
semble and the spirit of the au-
dience. Although the ensemble
consists of singers from all over
the world, they have a feeling
of belonging to the Viennese
Opera. Otherwise, why would

The second point concerns
our audience. The most im-

ence are not those people in
expensive orchestra - seats,
but those who buy their stand-

These people, mostly stud-
ents, are called the “fourth

as the Opera has only three
galleries.

They are considered the most

critical, but also the most en-

up for tickets the night before
the performance, waiting the
whele night and the next day
just to hear, for instance, Re-
nata Tebaldi.

When 1 was in high school
and had more spare time, we
went to the Opera about
twice a month. It is perfect-
ly all right to take your date
to a standing-place, and tine
up for two or three hours
for a regular performance.
She will even pay for her
ticket.

Every day there is at. least
half a page in every Viennese
newspaper with criticism of the
last performance, coming pre-

mieres, or stars. And the amaz-
ing thing is that even people
who do not care about music
read it, simply because you
cannot make. conversation with.
out knowing what is going on
in the Opera.

The Viennese Opera has had
many celebrities in its audience,
such as businessman Henry
Ford II; kings and queens from
Europe, Africa, and Asia; and
some months ago even Mr.
Khrushchev. However, the
Opera's fame did not come from
these visitors.

It is the love and faith of the
Viennese which created and sus-
tain the spirit of their Opera.
