Photojournalist brings
Tibet to Davidson

By Erin BERRY

Photography Editor

Award-winning photojournalist Steve
Lehman spent over ten years photographing

the Tibetan people: photographs that would

later become a part of his 1998 book, The
Tibetans: A Struggle to
Survive.

Tuesday night Mr.
Lehman presented a
talk and slide show fea-
turing his intensely
emotional, stirring pic- _
tures of Tibet and her
people.

Lehman began his »
career as a photojour-
nalist in 1987 when he
first captured images of
the first Pan-Indepen-
dence movement in Ti-
bet. Since then his pho-
tographs have appeared
in Newsweek, The New
Yorker, and the Wash-
ington Post, as well as
on news stations such
as CBS and NBC. His
1998 book on the Ti-
betans received the Best
Book Award in 1999.

Earlier in the afternoon a group of students
joined Lehman on the Union Patio for a
forum about his career in photojournalism as
well as his experiences and thoughts in creat-
ing his book. When asked how the initial idea
for his book came about he spoke of his
frustration with the prior portrayal of Tibet in
the media and popular culture, sparking his
desire to begin such a project. Lehman said,
“I wanted to create a book that would give a
voice to the Tibetan people, give a voice to a

work in Tibet.

Photojournalist Steve
Lehman discussed his

people that might otherwise not have’ access

to the outside world and to tell the story of
Tibet in a factual and real way.” His book is
a conglomeration of black and white as well
as color photographs, but also news photo-
graphs, collages, quotes and oral histories he
gathered while traveling in the country.
The slide show and lec-
ture in Love Auditorium
presented many of the pho-
tographs and collages fea-
tured inhis book. Described
as “intentionally disturb-

a powerful demonstration
of a side of Tibet that is not
often seen. Lumbar yards
and uranium mines, pris-
ons, political demonstra-
tions and montages of pho-
tographs of political pris-
oners and political martyrs:
each was a strong represen-
tation of the reality that is
modern day Tibet. During
the slide show, Lehman
read quotes that he had gath-
ered from Tibetan people,
helping to give a voice to
his images.

One of the photographs
was of the 1987 demon-
stration when a group of young Tibetan monks
staged a peaceful protest that included the
carrying of homemade Tibetan flags. This
was one of the first photographs Lehman took
in Tibet. Several years later he explained, he
was able to interview one of the leaders of the
demonstration after he had escaped to India.
Lehman read from an oral history he col-
lected from this young monk who explained,
“we could not remain silent to the things that
were happening.”

might happen if there’s a rush on the system
and 350 people try to access it during the last
fifteen minutes it’s open,” he said. He is
confident, however, that minor problems will
be solved quickly and the new system will be
successful. ““We don’t want our effort to do
something new and better to imperil anyone’s
ability to get the courses they need,” he com-
mented.

_This year, because of the online capabili-
ties, incoming first-year students will also
use the tree system. Instructions and helpful
hints will be available on the website. Dr.
Epes expects the new system to significantly

benefit students studying abroad. Currently,
they must submit their trees through the mail,
and the registration process begins whether
or not all trees are in. Now, students who are
abroad will be assured of being able to submit
their preferences on time.

Also different this semester is the selection
of non-credit and P.E. courses. Students will
enroll in non-credits during Drop/Add, not
during this initial registration period. The
P.E. department will handle enrollment for
all its classes through a separate website.
While the appearance of registration will
change, its general procedures and methods
will not. “This doesn’t change the informa-
tion process. Registration, despite its eccen-
tricities, is widely perceived as fair and noth-
ing about that will change,” said Epes.
