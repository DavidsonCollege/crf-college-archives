sary link between freedom and
education, and the importance of
maintaining such a bond for the
social environment of a college
campus.

With thisestablished, Williams
progressed into the role of the Select
Committee and the process under-
gone by which it came to its con-
clusions. According to Williams,
the Committee’s job was simply to
assess the level of intolerance at
Davidsonand to make suggestions.
“We were not a judicial body,” he
said. “Considerable and specific
evidence was avoided to protect
the privacy of individuals.”

Furthermore, he continued, the
Committee was unanimous in its
conclusions, and its recommenda-
tions were reviewed by legal coun-
sel to the College. Overall, Wil-
liams said, the College was found
to be “a fundamentally tolerant
community, with a few individu-
als who have acted in an uncivil
manner.” The core of the prob-
lems on campus, according to
‘Williams, stem from a conflict
between the first and fourteenth
amendments - the right to free
. speech and the right to education,
respectively. “Students have the
right to free speech, but not to a
point where they infringe upon
other students’ rights toeducation,”

he said. “We must learn to balance
the right to free speech with the
right to association.” However, in
a setting such as Davidson’s, Wil-
liams noted, the right to education
must be considered first and fore-
most.

Next to speak was John Pat-
ton, a senior who served as a
member of the Select Committee,
addressing the issue of “how to
rebuild community.” According
to Patton, the mission of the Com-
mittee was to determine which
aspects of the community did not
fit within the established defini-
tion of Davidson as a Christian
foundation based upon “equality,
human dignity, caring, and human
compassion.” Given this “love thy
neighbor” theme, Patton said, it
becomes apparent that no individ-
ual is beyond guilt. “It is not justa
select group that needs to hear this
report,” he said, “it’s everyone.”

An example of the broad ex-
tent of campus intolerance that
Patton mentioned was his discov-
ery that, until last year, the bath-
rooms in the college laundry had
remainedracially segregated. Con-
tinuing, Patton called for a more
active role on the part of individu-
als within the community and a
renewed sense of individual re-
sponsibility for all. Given this, he
concluded, “the college will not
only rebuild itself, but reach anew
level of quality for everyone.”

Speaker Addresses
‘Homosexuality and —
the Christian Faith" ©

By Danny Newman
On Tuesday night April 21,
the Davidson College Chapel Com-

mittee sponsored a presentation ,

given by Dr. John Carey entitled
“Homosexuality and the Christian
Faith”. Carey is notonly the chair-
_man of the religion department at
Agnes Scott, but he also chaired
the Presbyterian Committee on

Sexuality, which studied the issue ©

of homosexuality and its relation-
ship to the church.

Carey began by asking a basic
question, “Why do Christians take
interest in the subject of homo-

_ sexuality?” Carey noted that most
Christians believe that the Bible
condemns the practice of homo-
sexuality becauseitisagainstGod’s
plan for humanity. Historically,
Christians have waged a “moral
crusade” against gay and lesbian
persons. However, the recent
acceptance of homosexuals into
mainstream society has caused a
great deal of trouble for the church.

In response to this, many
churches have allowed homosexu-
als to gain membership into their
congregations, yet relatively few
churches have granted homosexu-
als the right to become ordained
ministers, he said. After four years
of studying homosexuality,
Carey’s committee recommended
thatthe Presbyterian Church should
allow homosexuals to become

ordained.

Carey then turned to the sur-
prising aspects of homosexuality
that he learned about during the
study. Chief among these were the
misperceptions that the heterosex-
ual_community had about the
homosexual community. He
mentioned that the heterosexual
community perpetuates myths anid
stereotypes about homosexuals.
Much of the gay and lesbian com-
munity is perceived to be com-
posed of “transsexuals, cross-
dressers, transvestites, and drag

* queens,” he said; however this is

just not true.
Most. homosexuals live nor-

mal lives. Carey remarked that”

most heterosexuals do not under-
stand the pain and suffering that
most homosexuals go through in
dealing with their sexuality.. Un-
fortunately, he said, the homopho-
bic and patriarchal society that we
live in does not make these prob-
lems any easier to solve.

~ Finally, Carey discussed ways
in which the Christian community
can help overcome the problems

that homosexuals face. First, he

said, we should “resolve to be part
of the answer instead of part of the

problem.” Second, he said, we
shouldask all churches to be inclu- °

sive communities; and third, he
said, we should become better in-
formed about homosexuals.

Students Will Terry was next given
the stage. Terry began by empha-
sizing that “one cannot separate
social life and academic life,”
stressing the directrelationship that
affects one when the other deterio-
rates. Terry continued, giving a
brief history of the alcohol policy
at Davidson, in which he noted the
increasing amountofalcohol abuse
that began in 1986 with the estab-
lishment of a fixed policy by both
the State and‘ the College. This
“abuse,” defined as, “behavior that
threatens the welfare of others
through physical violence or ver-
bal violence,” shows no signs of
immediate abatement, according
to Terry.

Correspondingly, the main
reason for a new alcohol policy,
Terry said, is that students are
incapable of self-discipline. “It
appears that students are not really
able to police themselves where
alcohol is concerned,” he stated.
Second, he continued, is the fact
that, with repeated incidents of
abuse, “the college and independ-
ent organizations are more libel
now than they ever have been.”
The third reason, Terry said, is the
breaking of State laws, an issue
which has become a growing con-
cern among the Trustees. It is this
flagrant ignorance of the State’s
alcohol policy, Terry said, that
cannot be allowed to continue.

Terry went on to outline the
three cornerstones of the policy,
which are the one-cup rule, the

monitoring system, and the con-
tinuing presence of the Alcohol
Enforcement Committee, which
will oversee the installation of the
new policy and handle all infrac-
tions next year. “This policy may
drive students off campus, and that
will be regrettable,” Terry said.
“But I do not think we can allow
the demoralization and devasta-
tion of the community with the
continuing abuse of alcohol.”

This “demoralization,” Terry
went on, stems in large part from
the centralization, of Patterson
Court in Davidson’s social life.
Terry concluded by urging stu-
dents not to be “petulant,” but to
take a positive attitude towards the
new alcohol policy and towards
the community at large.

The last speaker of the evening
was David Wright, Chairman of
the Patterson Court Council, who
addressed the role of the Council
in the deliberations that preceded
the new alcohol policy. According
to Wright, the Council workcd
closcly with several administra-
tive organs on campus, providing a
list of recommendations and
amendments - the majority of
which are included in the new
policy. The changes in the alcohol
policy, Wright said, despite the
concern among students, will al-
low for an expansion of social life
and a well-rounded campus envi-
ronment. Wright stipulated, how-
ever, that students must first aban-
don. the “passive, apathetic, unas-

suming roles that they have tradi-
tionally held” and adoptan “active
stance” in invigorating the campus
with new life.

In closing the forum, Anthony
Foxx, SGA President, took an
opportunity to give a response to
the concerns that have been voiced
by the student body and to outline
the goals that must be pursued in
order to achieve a greater level of
overall community at Davidson.
According to Foxx, the campus
must deal directly with the prob-
lems that confront the community
rather than criticize the legislation
issued by the administration. “We
mustcome to grips,” he said, “with
what made it necessary for
Davidson to propose a new alco-
hol policy,and what made itneces-
sary for the Sclect Committee to
issuc its report.”

Inapproaching these problems,
Foxx proposed several goals: in-
creascd social inclusiveness and
interaction, a positive attitude
towards the new alcohol policy, a
more improved, interdependent
community - encouraged by a
system that will reward Patterson
Court houses for their efforts to
increase Campus unity, and a pro-
gram that will foster a greater sense
of community in the arriving fresh-
men of years tocome. “We have to
come next fall with a brand new
attitude about Davidson,” he said,
summing up the message of the
forum. “Let’s make next year a
year of community.”

Davidson Celebrates Earth Week

By Christopher Edwards

Davidson’s Campus* Forum
Committee, chaired by Beth Wil-
lard, led Davidson in celebrating
Earth Week from April 12-19.
Earth Week festivities consisted of
a study break on April 13 and the
presentation of an environmen-
tally-oriented display in the Union
Pit.

The study break consisted of a
screening of the Dr. Seuss film The
Lorax plus free Ben and Jerry’s ice
cream to all those who brought
their own bowl. More than 100

people turned out for. the’ study -.

“The Union Pit display’ con-
sisted of a large “Earth Week”
banner and posters promoting
environmental awareness and ac-
tion. The posters highlighted envi-
ronmental facts, and it suggested
ways in which Davidson students
could help.

To save water, for example,
don’t take long showers or leave
water running while shaving and
brushing your teeth. To reduce
greenhouse gases, carpool more,

bicycle or-walk more and travel by

train instead of flying or driving.
To reduce landfill waste (and con-
sequently, your taxes, which pay
for landfills), use recycling bins
located in many dorms and in the
Union.

The Campus Forum Commit-
tce sponsors many other diverse
and ifteresting events throughout
the school year. To join up, call
