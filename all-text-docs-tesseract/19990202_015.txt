Swimmers cap off record season

By ALISON KALETT
Sports Editor

With Saturday’s impressive 45-
point win over Duke, the men’s swim-
ming and diving team finished this sea-
son at 6-7, one of their best records ever.
According to head coach Rich DeSelm
the ‘Cats sealed up the victory by the
middle of the meet when they were
ahead by a solid 34 points,

“By the 200 fly we put the meet out
of reach,” DeSelm said. “They [Duke]
weren’t deep enough to break into our
lead.” Overall, DeSelm was extremely
pleased with the team’s victory. “It was
a great win,” he said. “Our men swam
very strong. They had a look that they
would win and they did.”

DeSelm was also thrilled with sev-

eral individual performances, especially
sophomore Kurt Hirsekorn, who had
a lifetime best time in both the 200 yard
individual medley (1:55.73) and the
200 yard breastroke (2:06.59).
Hirsekorn took first place in both events.
In addition, junior Mark Medendorp
won the one-meter diving event and
took second in the 200 yard butterfly,
an event in which he swam his lifetime
best time of 1:55.83.

Also enjoying solid performances
for the ‘Cats were freshman Graham
Gravley who swam his best time of the
year in taking second place in the 1000
yard freestyle, senior Michael McCabe
who claimed second place in the 100
yard free, and junior Sam Kuykendall
who won the 200 yard butterfly. David-
son also dominated entire races as the

trio of McCabe, sophomore Matt West,
and senior co-captain Jay Rsosenquest
took first, third, and fourth places re-
spectively in the 200 yard freestyle. The
‘Cats also claimed second, third, and
fourth places in the 500 yard freestyle,
while the 400 yard medley relay team
swam their best time of the year.

Although the women’s team fell
to Duke by 59 points they finished the

Tegular season at 5-8, breaking their
previous record for most wins in a sea-
son.

Freshman Shelley Conroy had
lifetime best times in both the 1000 yard
freestyle and the’ 200 yard breastroke
and is looking forward to performing
well at her first Southern States cham-
pionships. “I’m more excited than ner-
vous,” Conroy said. “The season is go-

ing really well.”

Also freshman Starr Daniell won
the 200 yard butterfly and Junior Mary
Shell Brosche had an outstanding meet,
winning the 200 yard individual med-
ley and the 200 yard backstroke. Brosche
swam season best times in both events.
Finally, in dropping time off her 200
yard individual medley and 200 yard
breastroke, junior Karen Fritchie had
her best performances of the season.

Looking ahead, the ‘Cats will have
over two weeks to prepare for the South-
ern States Championships to be held at
Davidson beginning on February 18.
“We’re excited to have 18 days off,”
DeSelm said. “We need to get healthy,
well rested, and sharpen up. We’ ve had
achallenging but fruitful season. We’ ve
trained all year for the Championships

and we’ re on target for Southern States.”
“The goal has been to perform
well at Southern States,” said freshman
Graham Graveley. “We’ ve been work-
ing extremely hard and these are step-
ping stones on the way. The enthusiasm
has been increasing rapidly.”

We’ve got spirit, yes we do, we’ve got spirit. . .

When I sat down in the stands at
the Davidson/College of Charleston
basketball game Saturday night, I had
not slept since Thursday night. When I
don’t sleep enough get very dark circles
under my eyes and my head hurts a lot.
I hadn’t slept because three friends and
I decided to go visit Duke on Friday
night. :

So Jessica, Lindsey, Ramya and I
made the two and a half hour drive to
Durham. While there, I got the chance
to visit “Kryzewskiville.” For those of
you who have never heard of such a
place, itis a tent community set out in a
field on the campus of Duke University.
Die-hard Duke basketball fans camp
out during the season as a show of

Women’s Track

support for their highly successful bas-
ketball team.

As I got the twenty-five cent tour
of the campus I felt myself drawn to
make comparisons between Davidson
and Duke. One

I spent Saturday in a daze, trying
to keep one foot in front of the other
because I was spent. But I had my ticket
for the basketball game, and even if I
collapsed while watching, I was going

other. I had heard about the matchup
between UNC-Chapel Hill and College
of Charleston. Chapel Hill lost. I knew
how big a win would be for the Wild-
cats.

What I never ex-

feeling that I was
left with was how
impressive the
spirit on Duke’s
campus was. I felt
like this quality

“The spirit in Belk Arena was contagious. You
could see it infect the players in the first half, as Ali
Ton and Landry Kosmalski pumped their fists at the

air and played to the crowd.”

was something
that Davidson
lacked. During the ride back home Sat-
urday morning, when I wasn’t wrapped
up in watching the Waffle House signs
pass by, I mused on various things: the
road, Elton Brand, Belk Arena, and the
mysterious identity of the person in the
Wildcat costume.

to sit in my bleacher seat and cheer. The
matchup was an especially interesting
one for me because Carl Thomas, one
of the College Charleston players, went
to Tampa Prep, just like yours truly.

I wanted to see Davidson run up
one side of Charleston and down the

the first half and
smiled. Here was
the pride and spirit that I saw in the
those tents at Duke. The spirit in Belk
Arena was contagious. You could see it
infect the players in the first’half, as Ali
Ton and Landry Kosmalski pumped
their fists at the air and played to the
crowd. Rr

The game was one of unthinkables.
The Wildcats ran out to a fifteen point
lead at halftime. By the end of the game,
they had lost it. My exhaustion, which
had dissipated during the course of the
game, returned even heavier than be-
fore. I could see the question in the
faces of Wildcat fans: How did this
happen?

It is a valid question to ask. But
there are other questions to ask as well.
For instance: How amazing was it to see
Belk Arena full of Davidson fans? How
often‘do we see rows of students sitting
behind the basket screaming at the op-
posing team’ s free throw shooters? Most
important of all: Will you ever forget
the pride an excitement you felt at that
record-setting game? I hope not. I, for
my part, will not.

‘Women tracksters off to impressive start

By Smytu Bitter
Sports Writer

Keeping the success and strong
efforts of their first indoor meet rolling,
the women’s track team travelled to
Johnson City, TN, this past weekend
for the second meet of their season.
Along with Davidson, 34 other teams
gathered at ETSU, which made for some
tough and exciting competition.

Racing began on Friday afternoon
with Janet Aardema, Smyth Bitter,
and Clare Frey running 800 meters.
Breaking the Davidson school record
of ten years, Bitter ran a 2:19.16 and
Frey (2:25.80) bettered her time by ten
seconds from the last meet. Aardema
(2:43.44) had a strong race, her first in
almost three years due to nagging inju-
ries.

Senior co-captain Jamilah Saw-
yer, who raced a solid 200 meters in a
time of 28.24 also ran on Friday. Saw-
yer, along with Bitter, Frey, and Tab
Combs, wrapped up the competition for
the day witha strong 4x400 meter relay,
where they finished third in their heat.

Saturday morning came much
sooner than most of the women had
hoped. At 9:30 a.m., Davidson was
represented in the 5000m by a senior
threesome of Beth Brewster, Jenny

(5:53.50). Billingsley was second in
her heat.

ing great effort in the lengthy race was

freshman Julia Kudravetz (12:05.90)
and senior Ellen Runnels (12:42.80).

Sawyer summed up the weekend’s
impressive outcome, “Our goal this
weekend was to run with honest effort.
Everyone gave 110% and good perfor-

mances were the result. Look for more
school records to fall at Clemson this
weekend.”

Joining twenty other teams,
Davidson will compete in the Clemson
Invitational on February Sth and 6th.
