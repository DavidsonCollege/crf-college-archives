Monday Night
The first revival service Monday night

greatly impressed those who attended with
while strength-
ening the general determination not to miss
a meeting. Few speakers have won the
hearts of their hearers in so short a time as
“Tollic.” The quartet also is
deserving of the highest praise. The two
hymns they rendered were of almost breath-
taking beauty, and the audience sat  spell-
hound until the last note had died away. A
great improvement in the group singing was
noticeable, particularly in the last chorus of
Let the Lower Lights Be Burning. Milton
and Hollingsworth ‘led in prayer.

After the quartet had sung Svill the Wray.
Dr. Thompson read a few verses from John,

necessary in the government of the student
body. Recognizing its object to be the pro-

motion of Christian fellowship and growth, |
the encouragement of earnest living among
the members of the student body, the guard-
ing against error, and the opposition to vice;
the “Y" is largely instrumental in the main-
tenance of student control. Having a gen- |
cral secretary, employed by the college, regu- |
lar officers elected from the student body at
an annual election, and an advisory council |
of faculty members, the Y. M. C. A. is con- !
ducted in a business-like and systematic man-
ner, and is doing a great work for the bet-
terment of college conditions.

But, there are other organizations beside |
the governing bodies on the campus; and |
they, too, play a big part in the affairs and |
activities of the students.

interesting

The Literary Societies deserve a place of |
special mention in the list of organizations. |
Formerly the one big organization or or-
ganizations on the campus, the literary so-
cieties have suffered an apparent neglect in |
the past few years. But, their importance
has never diminished. A vital factor in the
political life of the campus, a school for the
cultivation of the voice and intellect, and the
hub around which the majority of students
center their interest—the literary societies
will always occupy the pinnacle of impor- }
tance among the important organizations and
institutions on the campus. Four societies: |
the Eumenean, the Philanthropic, the Pan- |
deinic, and the Metrophilian, compose the |
group of literary organizations at Davidson. |
_ The latter two are off-springs of the former.
The literary societies should be the center of
attraction for the student who is desirous of |
a combination of real honest-to-goodness |
| benefit and pleasure, but to the lazy and in- |
different they offer no inducement.

With the strong list of organizations that
,exist on the Davidson campus, is it any |
| wonder that students find themselves forever

Dr. Thompson closed his intense plea with
these impassioned words: “Analogies fail
when we deal with Jesus Christ, but [ think
we all want to live in Him, dignified, in-
spired, empowered, and knit to Himself by
His boundless love. The life abundant is
the life eternal. What more do you want a

i friend to do for you than Jesus Christ does ?

Don't think we love Him?

He meets the test.”

“Working Your
Way”

Made Feasible

Writing life insurance has
enabled many a man to pay his
‘way through college. It is a
dignified calling and a true socia!
service,

To induce your fellows to form
habits of thrift — to obligate
them to put by a little of their
income — to safeguard them
against future loss of earning
power—is a form of effort that
brings keen satisfacfion as well
as profit.

These are only a few of the
reasons why the insurance bus-

iness today is, attracting the
very best brains of America.

Write for the full particulars of
a plan whereby you can assist
yourself through college, and,
at the same time, prepare for a
profitable and satisfactory bus-
iness career,
