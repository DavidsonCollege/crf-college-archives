(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

Oops...

Browsing through the Wildcat
Handbook this week, we noticed that
the notorious “trunk rule“ which was
approved by the faculty last Decem-
ber had been omitted from the facul-
ty regulations.

Feeling that there were surely
some error of omission in including
the amendment in this year’s hand-
book, we naturally asked if for some
reason the insertion had been over-
looked.

The answer: No. The omission
was not a mistake, we were told, and
was brought about by the amendment
to the student body drinking rule
which was approved last May on the
day before examinations began.

A condition clause in the “trunk
rule” approved by the faculty stated
that the rule would be automatically
rescinded if the student body drink-
ing rule were amended at any time
except for including the trunk rule
provision.

What is so ironic about the mat-
ter is that the amendment approved
by the student body in May brought
the student regulation on drinking
more in line with the faculty ruling,
yet the “trunk rule” was stil] rescind-
ed.

Article VII, Section 2 of the
student body regulations prohibits the
possession of alcohol on campus. It

reads in part, “Every student found.

guilty of violation of this regulation
will be punished according to the ser-
iousness of the offense... .” The
trunk rule follows. Before the amend-
ment was adopted, the rule read,
“Every student found guilty of viola-
tion of this regulation shall be sus-
pended from the College .. . ,” a rule
with no exceptions.

There are doubtless many stud-
ents now with liquor in the trunks of
their automobiles, yet truthfully
ignorant of the change in the faculty
regulations. Last spring when the
question was put before the student
body there was no mention made of
the possible removal of the “trunk
rule” by the faculty. .

Student Body President Bill
Council told THE DAVIDSONIAN that
he had no knowledge of the omission
of the “trunk rule” until last week-
end. Other student leaders questioned
about the situation had no knowledge
of the change either.

Only last month a letter from the

office of the dean of students was sent
to all students informing them of the
change in the traffic regulations
prohibiting motor bikes on campus.
No notice was sent about the trunk
rule.

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts, Jr. asserted that while the
drinking rule amendment was adopt-
ed before the end of school last
spring, the change in the traffic regu-
lations was made during the summer;
thus, students were informed of the
change by mail.

Dean Burts told THE DAVID-
SONIAN this week that he was in-
formed of the condition clause in the
faculty minutes of last December
while compiling the materia] for the
handbook this summer.

The ire of some professors was
drawn this week at the faculty's
monthly meeting, when it was an-
nounced that the rule had been: taken
off the books by the administration
this summer in accordance with the
condition clause.

Fortunately, some _ professors
plan to re-introduce the “trunk rule”
at the faculty’s next meeting in Octo-
ber.

We are sorry to see this situation
arise. Definitely the administration is
at fault in failing'to advise the student
body, much less the student leaders,
of the automatic rescission of the rule.
But on the other hand, students them-
selves may shoulder some of the re-
sponsibility because of the hurried
manner in which the amendment was
adopted—on a reading day before
examinations.

In a May 21 editorial. we ques-
tioned the then-pending referendum:
“We do question the haste in present-
ing this matter before the student
body in such an unorthodox manner.
Holding the referendum on a reading
day before examinations smirks of the
hasty moves by which the infamous
Speaker Ban Law was adopted by the
North Carolina General Assembly two
years ago.”

The consequences of running
headlong into the drinking amend-
ment are probably not so great as
those raised by the helter-skelter law-
makers, but the lessons to be Jearned
are similar.

“Haste makes waste,” goes the
old saw. It sure made a mess of things
here.

A Word To The Wise

Along with the many other mem-
bers of the college community, we
wish to take time to welcome the
members of the Class of 1969 to the
campus.

Teach freshman is probably so full
of advice from so many people that
anything we might add would seem
trite or superfluous or both.

The class as a whole has brought
tremendous credentials along with the
traditional tag, “the best yet.”. Yet
professors around here have a way of
throwing credentials out the window
when it comes to classroom work. _

Freshmen this year have a parti-
cular challenge before them as they
test the new rush system adopted by
the IFC last year following the fra-
ternity evaluation discussions.

Several observers have remarked
that the Class of '69 seems so much
more sophisticated about fraternities
than those in years past. This is good,
for heretofore the naivete of many
freshmen was atrocious and often dis-
astrous.

We do not envy the IFC in trying
to enforce the revised rush regula-
tions for this year. Dirty rush has
been prevalent in the past in the short
span of a week’s rushing period. With
rush actually spread out across the
entire semester for the first time,

strict enforcement should be fhe
watchword to prevent an embarassing
situation for the fraternity system.
Elaborate rush plans must be in
the making, however, as the rush
chairmen for nearly every fraternity

were on campus before freshmen

orientation began. Some were even
seen as freshmen arrived for the pre-
orientation camp.
s e s

Hardly anything but praise has
been heard for the fine work done by
the YMCA at this year’s freshman
camp. ;
With a growing number of fresh-
men attending the camp each year,
the future potential for the camp is
unlimited. This year nearly two-thirds
of the freshman class attended.

With a growing number of stud-
ents attending the camp, the college
should recognize that many parents
will be arriving with their sons before
the first official day of orientation.

Tuesday when the freshman par-
ents arrived with their sons the
campus was littered with limbs and
other trash. Some parents even com-
lained that the dorms were not clean.
t is likely that more parents were on
campus for the beginning of freshmen
camp than on Thursday when the col-
lege laid out the red carpet for the
visitors.

Student Sees Close Race
In Sunday's German Vote

(Editor’s Note: West Berlin
Mayor Willy Brandt challenges
Chancellor Ludwig Erhard in
Sundev's West German national
election, the first balloting in the
strategic European country
since incumbent Erhard replac-.
ed aging Konrad Adenaur three
years ago.

for THE DAVIDSONIAN.)

By ERHARD JORCHEL

Richardson Scholar

There are three major potiti-
cal parties in Germany: the
Liberals (FDP). the Socialists
(SPD), and the Christian Demo-
cratic Union.

The CDU has been in power
for 16 consecutive years. The
party was formed after World
War II mainly by members of
the former Centrum Party
which had been a Catholic party
in the Weimer Republic. But
soon Protestant politicians join-
ed the party and under the able
leadership of Konrad Adenauer
the CDU developed into a truly
supra-demoninational party.

In the term of 1956 the CDU
even managed to capture the
absolute majority but at the
same time it had acquired its
peak, In the next elections they
lost their absolute majority and
were forced to form a coalitio
with the Liberals. .

The Liberals represent about
12 per cent of the population in
the parliament (Bundestag).
But even though they are a
comparatively small party

cent), they could force Ade-
nauer to resign in favor of Er-
hard, the former Minister of
Economics..

They also claimed in the new
government some important de-
partments, among them the de-
partment of justice. The CDU

whad even to accept Erich Renele

the leader of the FDP as vice-
chancellor. But that was the
price the CDU was willing to
pay in order to keep the SPD
barred from the government.

The’ SPD has formed for 16
years the opposition and they
are thoroughly tired of it. Willy
Brandt. mayor of West Berlin
and leader of the SPD is more
than ready to overtake Erhard's
place. The SPD has long given
up Marxist ideals and presents
now about the same program as
the CDU—free enterprise with
mild socialistic influences.

Since the major parties have
almost identical party programs

election of persons rather than
parties. And that’s probably
why the CDU will eventually
emerge with a slight advantage.

Erhard's image seems to be
indestibly good and reflecting
economic growth and stability.
Furthermore the CDU can show
some remarkable accomplish-
ments and claim to advise even
more if they stay in power.

In favor of the SPD on the
other hand is the fact that many
people are tired of the CDU and
would like to see how someone
else could do the job. The SPD
also has the advantage of a
team which on the whole is
younger and shows more energy
than the aging team of the CDU.

So it’s going to be a very close
race and it’s hard to predict
anything. I dare say, however,
that very likely the CDU will
Tule for another four years,
since they will always be strong
enough to form a government

this election will be largely an with the Liberals.

Wildcat Handbook Proves

Useful Guide

By TOM CRAIG
Davidsonion Associate Editor
A Review

Only a few sins of omission
and commission mar this year's
Freshman @lass Bible, The
work of Britt Snider and his
1965 Wildcat Handbook staff has
produced an attractive and
handy publication for the use of
all Davidsonians.

Lou Hiil's well-done impres-
ston of Chambers graces the
book’s light green cover. The
volume’s dimensions have been
reduced a half inch in length
and width, and it is 24 pages
shorter than last year’s edition.

Greatest innovation in my
opinion is the full-page, section-
divider photographs. These re-
place the humorous, but unpro-
fessional, cartoons of last year.
The well-chosen photographs
ably introduce their sections.

Editor Snider explains in his
introduction that room numbers
were unneeded and purposely

‘left out due to delayed rush. He

anticipates appearance of the
APO Directory before Rushing
begins.

Pages 13 and 14 contain

To Freshmen

‘Helpful Hints’ of value to
students old and new.

Notably missing from the pub-
lication are the campus direc-
tory and town of Davidson map.
Both of these have in past years
proved invaluable to the student,
and I am sorry to see them
omitted.

Typographical errors, pardon-
able in a newspaper but not in
a prlication euch as the Hand-
book. were fairly evident, par-
ticularly on pages 77 and 78.

The missing picture. game
ruined the continuity of the
Handbook’s Class of 1969 lineup.
This could be remedied by a bit
of summer letter writing to in-
coming Fresman for whom the
staff has no photograph.

A bit of Sniderian humor can
be found on page 66. We wish
the Committee for Queens’
Dates every success.

The new Handbook continues
the recent trend to make the
publication a useful campus
guide, The personal comments
by staff members throughout
give what could be a sterile
rulebook a bit of life.

‘Freedom Of Thought Is
Essential To Education’

The essence of democratic
education is freedom of thought.
It is taught not only by precept
but by example, When the ex-
ample violates the precept, the
student can understandably be-
come cynical or confused.

Possibilities for such reactions
were raised by the controversy
ever Prof. Eugene Genovese at
Rutgers. They have been adis-
pelied by the decision of the
university’s board of governers
not to prefer charges against
Professor Genovese.

At issue was the possible ef-
fect of Dr. Genovese’s Marxist
intellectual position on his quali-
fications as a teacher. The
storm arose when he spoke out
at a teach-in last April. Now the
board has said that all its mem-
bers are “completely out of
sympathy” with the views Dr.
Genovese expressed. But it does
not find these views grounds for
dismissal. It notes that the pro-
fessor was judged not to have
violated his scholarly responsi-
bilities, the laws of his state, or
the regulations of his university,
including the requirement to
take a loyalty oath.

We, too, are ‘completely out
of sympathy’ with Dr. Geno-
vese’s Marxist views. Last year
we also disapproved of what the
trustees of the University of
Tilinois had called an ‘‘unreason-
ed and vitriolic’ attack on
Presideat Kennedy in the John
Birch Society's magazine,
American @pinion. Yet we sup-
ported the trustees in deciding
not to discharge the Mlinois
teacher who wrote it.

Academic freedom is vital to
the spirit of inquiry that fosters
education for democratic citi-
zenship. It must be allowed to
cut both ways—te the right and
to the left—whether the majority
agrees or disagrees.

The Illinois trustees concur-
red with the report of a faculty
committee on academic freedom
that a proflessor“‘must have the
right to be as ungloriously
wrong and suffer the profession-
al consequences thereof, as to
be gloriously right and recieve
the acclaim of his professional
colleagues therefor.” .

Society requires contro! of be-
havior. But organizational ef-

forts to control thought must be

‘resisted as dangerous to human

advancement. If the citizen of
law abiding behavior is penal-
ized for unpopular intellectual
views, it is not hard to imagine
a totalitarian progression to
penalizing law-abiding citizens
for unpopular religious cohvic-
tions,

Freedom for views with which
we disagree—this is at the heart
of the democratic system.

The hidden persuaders are
more of a danger than the open
espouser of unpopular ideas.
