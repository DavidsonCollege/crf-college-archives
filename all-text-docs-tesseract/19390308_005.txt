Freshmen Are

Found Guilty

Squires Threatens Yellow
Caps for Freshman
Campus-Breakers

At the regular semi-month-
ly meeting held in Phi Hall at
9:30 last Tuesday night, the
Court of Control campused
four freshmen until the Spring
Holidays for breaking the
campus restrictions set upon
their class during the past
week. These were Charlie
Webb, Stanley McAfee, Nor-
man Aarseth, and George Lil-
ly.

“The sentences were pronounced

during chapel Wednesday morning
Judge Squires, and the usual
heckling came from the upper-
classmen. Appeals have been made
again and again to the upperclass-
men for more support, but
from the usual verbal comments
cast upon the Freshmen in chapel,
no other steps have been taken to
remedy the situation at hand. Out
of the ten Freshmen brought be-
fore the court in the last meeting,
cight were turned in by members
of the court itself. More co-opera-
tion

that it be given in connection with
the wearing of freshman caps and
also in connection with the penal-

Warning
Here is a casual warning to the
freshman class: any man guilty of
breaking an individual campus sen-
tence will either receive a YEL-
LOW CAP or will before
the Student Council.
