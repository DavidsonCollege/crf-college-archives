into overnight fame in New York and made

reviews. As general rule,

but local theatre-goers who visited the Astor

Theatre in New York, the first of the
metropolitan runs, expressed the opinion that
the hit will be even greater here, where
Hugo's great work is so widely known.

Seems like this is a reflection on Gotham's
literary leanings.

From all advance accounts Universal has
all .the ingredients of a great success—a
story that is internationally famous, that is
replete with action, albeit somewhat grue-
some, the greatest of character stars in Lon
Chaney, an excellent supporting cast, studio
facilities, and unlimited funds. It may be
divulging a trade secret, but it has leaked out
that Universal, to guard against the least
chance of adverse criticism, called in the di-
rector of New York's greatest cinema houses
and one of the leading newspaper editors and
had them do the final touches. The result is
said to mark ‘the dawn of a new day in
cinema art and one that has made Carl
Laemmle's slogan of “Better and finer pro-
ductions” an absolute fact.

Lon Chaney,*admittedly the finest inter-
preter of unusual character roles on either
stage or screen, plays the stellar part of |
“Quasimodo,” with Ernest Torrence as
“Clopin, the underworld king,” and Patsy
Ruth Miller as “Esmeralda.” Seventy-two
other noted performers have featured parts,
while 200 players interpret smaller roles
with the mob scenes numbering slightly in
excess of 3,500 persons.

Sgme idea of the immensity of the pro-
duction can be obtained when it is stated |
that the entire Cathedral of Notre Dame
Was reconstructed at Universal City, as well
as eight blocks of Parisian streets and
houses of the time of Louis XI. The total
cost was a trfle less tharr $1,500,000.

TWO DELEGATES

arise in the colleges.. Among the things
discussed at the conventions are the
maintenance of schol spirit, the finan-
cing of college publications and various
other student body problems of greater
or smaller magnitude. It is rumored that
the delegates from Davidson will bring
up the question of paying college ath-
letics during the next convention. Should
this be done, Davidson’s firm stand
against such practices will be more ex-
pressed than ever before.

At the last convention, held at the’
University of Tennessee at Knoxville on
April 27th and 28th, last year, there were
sixteen of the leading Southern colleges |
and universities represented. Officers of
the association elected at that meeting to
serve during the year 1923-24 were Estes
Kefauver, University of Tennessee, pres-
ident; George W. Milan, University of
Florida, vice-president; and P. C. Beatty, |
president-of ‘the student body of .N. .C.|
State, secretary and treasurer. Under
their guidance, the federation has ex-
perienced a considerable growth during)
the past year.
