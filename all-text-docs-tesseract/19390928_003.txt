Last week Pete Whittle announc-
ed a new intramural program ‘to
replace the program used last year.
This program calls for the dormi-

rather than the classes. There has

the question of the week is: “Do
you think the new intramural sys-

tem is superior to the old system?”

“Bud” Gilmore, Senior:

I believe that the new system of
intramurals will improve the feel-
ing between There will
be n¥ach better teams as a whole,

and thereby observe the actions of
the upper-classmen.
John Ragsdale, Senior:

I think this intramural system is
very much better than last year's.
It gives more boys an opportunity

upper-classmen,

to play. There is also a mixture of
boys from all classes by having
to run~by~ dormitories rather-than
classes.

Paul S. Crane, Junior:

“After the cheering and howling
of the big week-end’s games the
majority of Davidson men like
settle little sport for
the sport’s sake, free to all who
will get out and play! This playing
for fun and not the giddy
grandstands, is what we really get
the kick out of, I mean we less and
stars. The intramural
system of competition between the
dormitories will give more playing
to more and we can
carry on the traditional dorm squab-
bles in a sports-like manner with
maybe fewer water fights and win-
dow smashing parties. Let's .keep
up the Davidson but Tet it
out on the intramural field and less

the books! Here's to an “Every-

Richard Shore, Junior: Pr
The intramural system for Ahe

past two years has had a ‘tendency
to lag, but the present plas will en-
able more. boys to takepart in all
events and the competitive spirit
will be greater. The new checking-
out system for equipment will make
the interest“in all sports greater,
because there is a sufficient supply
of matérial for all students. I am
heartily in_ favor of the new plan
atid I expect it to make our intra-
better than
before,

Billy Tyson, Sophomore:

I believe that inter-dormitory
competition will be an improve-
ment class competition for
more boys will be able to partici-
pate. Instead of there being just
four teams there will be seven
teams. Although, class interest and
spirit may suffer, the difference
will be made up by the spirited
rivalry of the dorms, as was shown
last spring in the softball classic,
the Barracks vs. Eagles Nest.
Julian McCall, Sophomore:

“I think the new system is bet-
ter because for one thing it will
give more boys the chance to take
part, as there will be seven teams
now while before there were only
four. The present system will also
create keener competition as there
how much rivalry between the
dormitories. It will create more
school spirit, as the boys that parti-
cipate will become more interested
in the varsity athletics. This new
system will pit more evenly. match-
ed teams against. each other as
there will be men from all classes
playing.

Ed Hay, Sophomore:

I favor the old intraclass system.
Class teams have long been a tra-
dition at most schools and colleges.
I have often heard my father and
other men speak with pride of hay-
ing played on their class football,
basketball or baseball teams. What
do the fellows in a dormitory have
in common? Classmates suffer to-
gether as freshmen, go to classes to-
gether, graduate together. Why, then
shouldn’t they fight, united, for the
honor of their class? Many men
change dormitories each year. Isn't
it possible that the best athletes
may band together in one dormi-

The Dunbar Studio of Charlotte
will do the. photography for this
year’s annual. Mr. Dunbar will be
on the campus to take student pic-
tures during the week of October
16 to 18. It is very strongly re-
quested that everyone cooperate by
remembering this date and availing
themselves of the* opportunity to
have their pictures taken at the
time, thereby eliminating
delays and confusion so rife in past
years. The hours for the photo-
grapher will be 9 A. M. to 12 noon,
1 to 5:30 P. M. and 7 to 9 P, M. All
pictures will be taken in the parlor
of Watts.

championships? Dormitory pride is
all right, but it seems to me that
class pride is a lot better.

Elmer Bishop, Sophomore:

I am against
of substituting
sports intramural Sports. For
one thing, the purchase of addi-
tional equipment was hecessary to
enable this enlarged system of
sports to be carried. This increased
expense took away much-needed
equipnrént from the varsity football
team. I think there is no question
‘in the minds of the students of this
college as which of the two
sorts of sports is the most import-
ant. Another thing, the abolition of
intramural football, softball, and
other sports tears down to a great
extent, and even goes so-far as to
impair -class spirit. Now, class spiri
is one of thé most outstanding as
pects of Davidson College, for it
is the combination of the feelings
of the four classes that goes to
make the one, the invincible Wild-
cat Spirit. Another potent influence
to evil caused by the new sports
system is the influence it has on
the Freshmen. It will only enable
them to become more “horsey”
than ever by ,permitting them. to
go in and play along with and
against upper-classmen as if they
were their social, intellectual, and
physical equals.
