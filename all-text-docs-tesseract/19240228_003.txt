What are your ideas about a college
!education? Do you know? If so, why?
Is college a home for mutes? This is
evidenced by the dumb ones around here. |
Are you going to jig through life sceing
only the road to Charlotte or Concord?
Be broad-minded, - Use your heads a lit-
tle. They are not really so hard. Learn
to bull expertly. There are some who
condemn this noble practice of slinging
| the male cow, but it is an institution that
will never pass out. Bull is slung, bull
jis shot, but bull will never die. Dispute
this statement if you will, but remember
| those masters of this art and science:
Cicero, Pluto, Hoyle, and the
matadores.

Doyle,

Do you come to college to learn, or to
chase golf balls in yonder pasture? Are
you interested in learning, or are you
interested only in that event that takes
place three times a day? , Wake up!
Turn off the alarm clock, it disturbs
others. Why be a “cheap skate?” The
old man has plenty of dough, and is
anxious to spend it all on you. Just ask
him. Let's have leather bound text-
books; let's put elevators in all the dor-
mitories; let’s build us a Union Station!
What money? ‘Tis but a
dream, sometimes a nightmare. |

What do you know? Are you as ig-
norant look? Have you read
“The Daughter of a Moonshiner,” or that
noble poem, “The Rabbit’s Foot?” What
do you know? Are positive, or
negative; do you know something, or
Are you skilled in the art of
|xylopyrography? Figure out the mean-
ing of K. K. K. What do you know
about the Swiss navy? How many two-
| bit placed side by would
reach from here to there? Was Ran-
dolph born on February 14th? How
much water does a tank hold? Do you

ing, and B holds five aces, what does C
