Wildcats Win Two

Games From State

The Davidson Wildcats took the first of a
brace of games from North Carolina State
here Friday afternoon, 10 to 8, in a game in
which errors were costly to both teams.

State used three pitchers, while the Wild-
cats tried only two. Ws

Wade was most effective for the Techmen,
allowing but a single hit and no runs during
the three innings he twirled. Huie allowed
but four scattered hits to the Techmen dur-
ing the first six innings and had been scored
upon once by errors, but in the seventh frame
he weakened and Laird went in to finish the
game,

The State swatters outhit Davidson.  C.
Shuford, Harold, W. Shuford and Tate all
getting two bingles. Johnson and Kugler
tallied a couple of safe hits, one of Kugler’s
a double.

PLAYING THE GAME
| By Caldwell Withers |

Five varsity victories and one freshman |
| win in a week! -The Wildcat baseball nine!
jaccounted for two of these contests when
they took a batting bee from State on Fri-!
hen and the next day snowed the sante_team
lunder at Gastonia. i

| The trackmen more than doubled the score
{over South Carolina.. The Gamecocks were
severely handicapped by the absence of one
of their stars. Brewer, who was to enter the
| javelin, discus, shot put, high hurdles, and
the broad jump, was ruled ineligible on ac-
count of his studies just before the team left
Columbia.

South Carolina teams are having a hard
time with Davidson athletic teams this spring.
Wofford was defeated in track by a rather
large score and the Wildcat netmen have se-
cured two victories over the racketeers of
the University of South Carolina and ad-
ministered a 4 to 2 drubbing against Clem-
son on their Southern tour.

The baseball team left for Greenville to
play Furman yesterday. From the textile
center Coach Monk takes the team to Clem-
son for a contest today. Here's hoping that
the Wildcats will be able to keep up their
good record,

Davidson students had their last oppor-
tunity to see the local track team in action
last Saturday. Following close upon the
Clemson-Georgia Tech-Davidson meet to be
held at Clemson Saturday, Coach Tilson will
enter his best men in the State meet one,
| week later.

We are expecting Davidson to make a bet-
ter showing this year than she did last spring.
Carolina walked off with practically every
event, and, although it is generally conceded |
that the Tar Heels will win again this |
spring, the meet should be closer than in,
former years,

With five regulars and one substitute hit- |
ting over the coveted 300 mark, Coach Monk
has developed one of the hardest hitting base- |
ball nines in the state. When Laird and Huie |
are in form and Vance, Woodham and Cap-
tain Alford are socking the apple, Davidson |
is mighty hard to beat. Ask State,
knows !

Davidson Track Team to
Enter Triangular Meet
With Clemson and Tech

Strong Opposition Expected in Con-
test Against Tigers and
Yellow-Jackets

The Davidson track squad has one of the
stiffest meets of the season next Saturday,
when it will compete with Clemson and Geor-
gia Tech in a triangular met at Clemson.

The team will leave for Clemson on a bus
early Friday morning. Seventeen men, in-

manager, will make the trip.

(turn to Davidson Saturday night after the

meet.

Although Clemson has a strong track team,
it is not considered as good as last year’s.
Roy, Clemson's stellar dash man, holds the
Southern record for the 440 yard dash. Odell,
also of Clemson, broke the Southern record
for the pole vault a week ago last Saturday
when he cleared the bar at 12 feet 6 inches.

This is the next to the last meet that Da-
vidson will enter this spring. The state meet
in which cinder path stars from the leading
colleges of North Carolina will participate,
ends the season for the Wildcats.

Newman, the Tigers’ middle distance star,
has held the Southern record for the half
mile, against Georgia last week making the

Davidson Leads in
Race for Pennant

As it now stands the state title is far from
being conceded to any one team. Davidson
leads the standing column with four victories,
two of them over N. C. State, one from
Carolina and one trom Lenoir-Rhyne, and
one defeat by Duke.

Only four interstate coritests will be played
this week, Elon participating in two of them.
The Christians will be at home to Lenoir-
Rhyne this afternoon and will journey over
| to Chapel Hill Wednesday to meet the Tar

Heels, and on the same day Guilford will be
| host to Lenoir-Rhyne. The other game of
the week will be between N. C. State and
| Duke at Raleigh on Saturday.

year from other North Carolina teams. Wake

The Tar Heels have an even break in the

, victories and three defeats. The Christians
lost to Duke, N. C., State and Wake Forest

North Carolina State has won only one

two institutions’ but the Christians reversed

Raleigh institution twice last week and Wake
