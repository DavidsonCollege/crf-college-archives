A response to a faulty notion of civic virtue

Kimve tly Kreiling’s last few ar-
ticles camall be summed up in one
brief sentence. Her flawed appeal
for a welfare system based on gov-
ernment control is nothing more
than a desperate battle plan ‘of a
liberal mugged by reality.

Her last article, “There is a
cuckoo in the Gull’s nest,” fer-
vently but monotonously hammers
out the “end of equality” idea and
ends up in an accusatory guilt trip
for all who disagree with her. Inci-
dentally, Kreiling’s earnest but
chimerical_conclusions—are—just
another last ditch effort of Demo-
crats who have already seen the
follies committed under the ban-
ner of their far-fetched charity and
compassion systems.

In her writing, Kreiling blends
appeals to pity and ad homonym

and clutter

Wren I started writing this col-
umn about a year and a half ago, |
knew that I would often dabble in
material not often seen in newspa-
pers and that some of my. subject
matter might upset a few people:
the administration, the faculty, and
Amanda Davis.

True to my predictions, I got
reactions from people over various
things I wrote about: necrophilia,
drinking, naked babies, passing out,
flatulence, foul language, getting
sick from drinking, nose picking,
finishing your beer, voyeurism,
getting high off cleaning products,
playing with girls’ underwear, the
occasional mention of how much
beer means to me, and (how shall I
put it? Oh, yes) self-love.

Since I knew that I was going
to begin controversy, I made one
basic ground rule that I vowed
never to break. I promised myself
that | would absolutely, positively,
never ever apologize for anything
that I had ever written to or about
anyone, no matter how offensive,
disgusting, slanderous, or wrong
I may be.

Granted, | have been sorely
tempted torecant everything I ever
said on one or two memorable oc-
casions, | finally worked up the
nerve to approach a certain girl
whom I may or may not have been
thinking about when writing some
past article about nothing in par-
ticular. This was the first occasion
I had to speak to her since she
punched me in the stomach, so I
wanted to make a good impres-
sion.

I played smooth as long as I
could. 1. had an urge to throw
myself prostrate at her feet and
scream, “I’m sorry! Please forgive
me! I just couldn’t help it! I love
you! Just let me kiss your feet and
Ill leave you alone! I am so un-
worthy!” :

Fortunately for everyone con-
cerned, I didn’t. 1 played it cool,

attacks with lessons in economics
and history, which could easily be
recognized as incomplete and false.

First of all, the question of
whether government has the re-
sponsibility to improve the
population’s living standard does
not belong to economics. It does
not belong, as Kreiling would have
us believe, to the realm of history,
either. Instead, this is a purely
political issue—something which
the author does not seem to grasp
very well. :

Kreiling, undaunted, goes on
to state that “it is the obligation of
the government to provide the
highest living standard possible,

given the available resources.” She
justly believes that government
ought to strive for the best living
condition attainable. However, this
can only be done by allowing a free
market economy, and not, as
Kreiling suggests, by initiating
various governmental subsidizing
and regulating policies.

Further, the issue that the au-

thor completely missesisself-con- _

tained in the word “freedom.” The
French and Russian revolutions
took place not because of dispro-
portionate distribution of wealth,
but rather because of despotic rul-
ers that deprived people of their
freedom. The political systems

that followed, by the way, elimi-
nated the differences about which
Kreiling worries so much, but to
no avail—they only increased gov-
ernment police-like supervision of
most aspects of daily life and thus
destroyed the sacred notions of
individuality and creativity, due to
fear of being punished for standing
out of the crowd.

My problem with Kreiling’s
philosophy is rooted in her ill-ad-
vised blind faith in large scale gov-
emment programs, such as wel-
fare systems and government guar-
anteed and administered jobs and
housing. Kreiling passionately
writes about the “very factors that

and as per usual, she ran out of
interest for me in approximately

- twelve seconds.

The pointis that I didn’t apolo-
gize even when confronted with
those big blue eyes. I knew that I
could write anything about any-
thing and be safe keeping my vow.
If those baby blues couldn’t break
me, nothing could.

Well, it turns out that over-
confidence once again turns out to
be my downfall. Just as soon as |
thought that for once in my life I
could be unwavering about some-
thing which I truly believe in,
trouble rears its ugly head.

As most of you know, I was
going through some rough times
the two weeks before spring break.
I was cut off from the only form of
escapism effective enough to kill
my thoughts. Denial stopped be-
ing enough long ago.

Those of you who suffered
through my article in the last issue
of The Davidsonian know what
I’m speaking of. The weekly in-
stallment of my ramblings was
absolutely atrocious. I am embar-
rassed to put my name on that
article. It is the worst thing I have
ever written, including a book re-
port on Are You There God? It’s
Me, Margaret that I wrote in fifth
grade.

So, in order to make it official
that I have absolutely no integrity
whatsoever, that nothing I say to
anyone (including myself) can be
trusted, here goes. Much like all
the crustaceans I ate over spring
break, I have no backbone. Just
call me Soft Shelled Crab.

To everyone who read my ar-
ticle in the last issue of The David-
sonian, \’m sorry. ee

When heroes fall

I couldn’t believe what I was see-
ing. As I walked down the stairs
into the Commons, there it was,
undeniably in my face as plain as
day. Oh, horror of horrors! A
member of the female persuasion
was having a conversation with
none other than Nathan Seay.

“No,” you scream, “not the
guy with the backwards hat that
complains every week in The
Davidsonian about how revolting
he is to females! Not the guy that
causes every girl on campus to run
in sheer terror, especially those
with keys hanging out of their back
pockets!”

Yes, I tell you. And that’s not

_ the worst of it. Before my very

eyes, this same female touched
Nathan on the arm. It was not the
defensive “back off” response you
would expect, but a loving, caring
touch. Unbelievable! He thought
no one saw him, but now his cover
has been blown. And my hero has
fallen.

Yes, Nathan was the hero of
many a Davidson underclass male,
serving as a bastion of hope for
those pathetic few that always seem
to go unnoticed by the girls. He
proved to us that it was still pos-
sible to lead a perfectly normal
(well, at least semi-normal) col-
lege life without a date. Now, all
that is gone. Sorry, Nathan, I wish
it could have come to a better end
than this. :

All this just reinforces to me
the importance of heroes in our
society. At one point or another in
their lives, everybody has a hero.
Whether it be Tonya Harding, Bill

Clinton, or Jeffrey Dahmer, each
hero’s function is the same. A hero
provides an ideal, a goal, or a hope
for a person to model themselves
after in their search for personal
identity.

But what happens when this
ideal crashes in a fiery wreck?
What happens when Harding
breaks her opponent’s kneecaps,
Clinton ruins the economy (Gullan
owes me), and Dahmer--no need
to elaborate there. It happens ev-
eryday, folks. People that we place
in positions of worship are sooner
or later bound to disappoint us.

So what do you do? The way
I see it, heroes are still human and
are totally capable of succumbing
to human nature, as hard as that is
for some to believe. Therefore, we
should not be too hard on our fallen
heroes or hold any grudges. All of
us have probably been guilty of
some offense worthy ofa fall, ifwe
have been fortunate enough to be
heroes to anyone. ~

I guess what it comes down to
is that when your heroes fail, it’s
time to become your own hero.
Everybody’s got something inside
of them that’s worthy of admira-
tion and respect. It’s that some-
thing that each one of us needs to
discover and bring to the forefront
of our attention. A confident feel-
ing of self-respect and personal
worth is the key. Go ahead and try
it. Live your ideal and be your own
hero! You may surprise yourself.
And as for you, Nathan Seay,
you’re forgiven; but you’ve been
supplanted by my new heroes,
Beavis and Butthead. ;

have fostered the environment of
economic growth in the United
States for the last 100 years—pub-
lic institutions.”

Unfortunately for Kreiling,
and fortunately for society, noth-
ing could be farther from the truth.
If we were to follow her recipe for
prosperity, we would be, in fact,
destroying the sense of commu-
nity our society so badly needs.
There is a term to describe the
demagogic class structure to which
Kreiling’s “road to a better world”
leads—Communism. Kreiling
does not appear to fathom that
Communism did indeed collapse
because it was founded on a me-
diocre philosophy, ignoring
people’s self-interest.

The smoking
of individual
liberty

Commons and is told they have

just banned smoking. He goes
back to his room and opens the
newspaper only to read that the
Clinton administration is propos-
ing smoking bans in all buildings
(except homes) “regularly entered
by ten or more people per week.”
What is with these people?

If this Clinton thing passes,
owners of businesses will have no
choice whether or not to permit
smoking in their establishments.
Imagine the federal government
calling the owners of the Pub and
telling them that they must now
prohibit smoking. Bars would be
affected, yes, but also restaurants,
bowling alleys, warehouses, air-
ports, stadiums, etc. Ican imagine
Clinton’s emissaries taking
Davidson by force to arrest me for
smoking in the Knox lounge (and,
of course, stealing my wallet to
pay for health care). Yes, the law
as it is written would also apply to
lounges of residence halls.

The Clinton bill also bans
smoking “in the immediate vicin-
ity of the entrance” to any of these
places. I will not only have to
leave the bowling alley to smoke,
but will be forced to go into the
middle of the street, since the Taco
Bell entrance next door is also too
close. Isn’t this insane?

This government-as-nanny
trend, insidious as it is, is down-
right evil when one looks at the
acknowledged basis for this legis-
lation: the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) report of Janu-
ary 7, 1993, which started this ball
rolling. In this report, it was de-
clared that “environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS)” is basically equiva
