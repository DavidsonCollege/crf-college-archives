Graduate
Condemns
Airmen

American soldiers are kill-
ing defenseless Vietnamese
civilians without provocation,
a recent Davidson graduate
said in a national magazine
article.

Thomas F. Loflin, a 1964
Phi Beta Kappa graduate.
said that on at least six oc-
casions he heard US. heli-
copter pilots boast of killing
Vietnamese civilians.

Loflin, who took advanced
ROTC at Davidson. sold a
story with his charges to
Avent Gerde magazine.

The first time he heard
the boast was in a shower at
Camp Holloway, near Pleiku.
Vietnam, where Loflin was
stationed for four months last
year. . .

According to Loflin, a pilot

in the shower complained of
having his watch stolen by a
“gook." He said the pilot
vowed “every time I’ go up
T'm going to be looking for
some gooks. I got me three
today .. . I swooped right
down and zapped them.”
- In an interview at Chapel
Hill, where Lofiin is now a
Morehead Scholar at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, he
said that he did net think the
pilot's statement was an idle
boast.

“It seems like every time
I sat down with the pilots at
a meal sooner or later one
would. in effect. say he had
murdered Vietnamese with-
out any basis for this action.”’

Loflin, a Dana Scholar and
winner of the D. G. Martin
Journalism Award while at
Davidson, claimed it was
mostly junior officers who did
the boasting and complaining
about the war.

ed. “Students can be appoint-

such as Artist Series and
Public Lectures.”

"Hopefully new lines of
communication can be open-
ed up with all areas of the
college administration. Al-
ready there is the possibility
of students appearing before
several trustee committees,”
he said.

“The additional representa-
tion on certain faculty com-

National Greeks Push
New Affiliation Plan

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

National representatives of
Davidson's 12 fraternities
have presented an alterna-
tive to the college’s proposed
tatal social affiliation pro-
gram.

In a draft of a resolution

received last Friday by the
office of President D. Grier
Martin, the national fraterni-
ties proposed an extended
rush period to follow imme-
diately after formal rush and
be conducted on “‘an inten
sive, personal basis under
highly favorable circumstance
es,

The fraternities also tenta-
tively rejected the college's
proposed affiliation program.

The resolution draft, pre-
pared at a meeting of execu-
tive secretaries of the 12 fra-
ternities at Estes Park, Colo..
and dated July 12. indicated
an understanding and sym-
pathy with the college's ob

Trustee Group Approves
Principles Of Blue Sky

The trustees’ Education
Committee reacted favorably
to the work of the Blue Sky
Committee at a joint meet-
ing of the two groups Wed-

nesday, Dean of Faculty
Frontis Johnston said.
“The trustee committee

expressed hearty agreement
with the principles on which
we are trying to form a new
program,” Johnston reported.

The Wednesday meeting
was the first time any of the
trustees had met with the
Blue Sky Committee to dis-
cuss the proposed new curri-
culum.

Johnston emphasized that
the trustee committee made
no decisions about the report
and only explored some of the
possibilities inherent in the
report.

“I hope that the new curri-
culum, when approved ‘by
faculty and trustees, can be
implemented next year.” he
said. “Official decisions witl
not be made until later in the
fail.”

Organized last fall. the
Blue Sky Committee voted
to accept two non-voting stu-
dent members from a list
submitted by the Student
Council. In November Bobby
Lane and Doug Woodworth
were chosen. Woodworth
graduated in June.

A timetable set September
of 1968 as the deadline for in-
stituting the committee's re
port.

Released last May. the
committee report made the
following recommendations:

conventions and a_ revived
student exchange program.

Fletcher Hartsell and Geoff
Seamans were named as del-
egates to the meeting of the
Finance Committee.

A group of counci) mem-
bers was designated ‘to talk
to Dr. Tom Scott, director
of athletics, about allocating
seats immediately behind the
team for students at basket-
ball games in the Charlotte
Coliseum. A council resolu-
tion backing such a proposal
was unanimously passed.

Plott Settles Out Of Court

In Train-Auto Damage Suit

An out-of-court settlement
culminated litigation last
week of three suits filed by
members of Donald Plott’s
family after an  auto-train
collison here more than two
years ago. |

The settlement was made
Sept. 14 for Plott. professor
of music.

Plott's son. brother and
niece sued the Southern Rail-
way Co. for damages sustain-
ed when a Southern train
backed into Plott’s car on
Dec. 22, 1964. The collison
occured at the railroad cross-
sing on Griffin Street.

His brother and niece sued
Plott himself as a “friendly
party.” Plott was the driver
of the vehicle.

There was and still is no

signal at the crossing to
warn of an approaching
train.

The railroad based its de-
fense on the contention that
the train’s crew was observ-
ing adequated safety precau-
tions as the train entered the
crossing.

About six month before the
accident, according to David-
son Mayor F. L. Jackson. the
State Highway Commisston

enlisted the support of the
Town of Davidson and David-
son College in a request to
Southern Railway officials
that a warning signa! be set
up at the crossing.

The highway commission
was willing to assume. 90 per
cent of the cost of the pro
ject. The railroad would have
paid 10 per cent of the cost.

The railroad refused the
commission's request, accord
ing to Jackson. Railroad of-

ficials did agree to stop park-.

ing cars near the crossing
and have kept that agree-
ment, Jackson said.

Council members turned in
their schedules to Secretary
Sam Darby so that he might
work out a schedule for open
ing the renovated Student
Council office from second
period until 3 p.m.

Various members were as-
signed to study the possibil!i
ties of keeping classrooms in
Chambers open at night for
study and tutorial purposes
and. sponsoring an ‘‘open-end
type’’ assembly in which stu-
dents could question Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin and oth.
er administration members.

A three day symposium fea-
turing guest speakers and a
series of shorter symposia on
practical issues such as stock
market investing. featuring
Davidson professors, were
recommended for investiga-
tion.

Joe. Kilpatrick was assign-
ed to investigate the possibil-
ity of the athletic depart-
ment's giving letters to the
sailing team.

President Tom Earnhardt
raised a personal objection to
the increased prices at the
Union Snack Bar and ap
pointed a three-man commit-
tee to investigate.

Students keeping guns on
campus were reminded that
they must be turned over to

However, 10 of the 12 fra-
ternities said they were eith-
er constitutionally unable or
unwilling to accept the pro-
pos‘d program.

The controversial proposal
was drawn up last year bv
Davidson fraternity  presi-
dents at the request of the
Interfraternity Council.

Faculty approval was giv-
en to the fraternity presi.
denuts’ plan Jast spring. The
trustees, however. delayed
decision on the plan at their
spring meeting to allow more
time for study.

The resolution never clear.
ly outlined specific objections
to the proposal. It did call
attention to the fact that, un-
der the proposed program.
the fraternity system would
be obligated ‘‘to extend sub
stantial membership benefits
to . . . non-bid students in
the hopes that many or most
will ultimately be bid, pledg-
ed, and initiated... .”

Taking advantage of the
action of the college's trus-
tees in their meeting last

tive secretaries presented an
alternative proposal which
was constitutionally and oth-
erwise acceptable to them.

Lingle, Hall, Martin, Johnston Discuss College’s Future

Push For Campus Club
‘Temporarily’ Stalled

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Managing Editor
Attempts by Independents
to formally organize them-
selves and take a place in
Davidson’s unsettled social
set-up have apparently been
sidetracked—at least for the

time being.

A spokesman for the Cam-
pus Club. a group of about
three dozen Independents that
petitioned the administration
last May for official recogni-
tion and housing, said this
week the now-dormant group
had no plans “at this mo-
ment’ to renew its efforts.

But sophomore Franklin
Anderson, chairman of the
Campus Club's steering com-

mittee, said. ‘‘The door is
still open. We may try
again.”

The club's petition was re-
jected by the administration
last May for two reasons:

—The group was several
names shy of a_ requisite
number of committed mem-
bers.

—The administration con-
sidered it unwise to proceed
until after definite action had
been taken on the proposed
total affiliation social pro-
gram.

The Campus Club’s peti-
tion went first to the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities,
Clubs and Social Life, which
recommended in late April

that the club be established
and given housing if 40 stu-
dents would commit them.
selves to membership and
pay the necessary fees.

The faculty committee tur.
ther recommended that the
administration make ‘‘exten
sive renovations’ in Lingle
Manor for the group's use.

However. the club found
only 35 prospective members.

The Campus Club's efforts
were the most recent in what
has become an almost an
nual attempt of dissatisfied
Independents to organize
themselves.

In recent years, there has
been talk of an eating club.
but no results—leaving Lingle
Manor as the only organized
social outlet for Independ
ents.

The Campus Club failed
mainly because ‘“‘there just
wasn't enough time.’ accord.
ing to W. G. Workman. chair-
man of the new Faculty Com-
mittee on the College Union,
Fraternities and Social Life.

“It takes more than a year
to get one of these things
started.’’ he said. “I have an
idea that if the group works
on it this semester, there will
be a resurgence of interest
after pledging (in February)
and this thing could be car-
ried through.”

The idea was born in idle
conversation among Inde-

pendents shortly after last
year's pledging. according to
Anderson. It began with four
freshmen. but by spring over
aalf of the interested group
came from upperclassmen.
In early March, a nine-man
steering committee headed

to immediately follow the
end of formal rush and to be
carried out on ‘‘an intensive.
personal basis under highly
favorable circumstances.”*
Under this plan. non-bid
students would be allowed to
choose which fraternities
they would like to re-visit and
the order in which they would
do so. They would then eat at
each house, as a paying
guest, for a one-week period
after which they would ro-
tate to the next fraternity
which they had chosen.
This type of proposal was

STEP
To Seek
Tutors

Members of the Student
Tutorial Education Project
(STEP) hope to reach a num-
ber of underprivileged school
children in the Davidson-Cor-
nelius community this fall.

According to Mike Norris.
who helped to organize the
group in 1966, about 50 stu-
dents can by: used effectively
in the program. He said that
he hopes that additional stu.
dents will show interest so
that the program can be ex
panded.

The specific goal of STEP
in the past has been to help
those local. schoot children
who have had unusual diffi-
culties with their studies. To
attain this objective, STEP
members have tutored the
children, and through friend
ship built the self confidence
that children in schoo! need.

STEP. which is affiliated
with the: YMGA. is directed
on .campus by junior Bobby
King. Norris is spending this
year in full-time service to
VISTA. and has been placed
here in the Davidson com-
munity.

STEP members have plans
of expanding their program
this year, by working among
local teen agers. It has also
been. suggested that the tu-
tored children be brought to-
gether for picnics or field
trips.
