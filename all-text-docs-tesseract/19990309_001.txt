Davidson College President Robert F. Vagt

has announced the appoint-
ment of Clark G. Ross,
longtime chair of the eco-
nomics department, as the,
College’s new vice presi-
dent for academic affairs
and dean of faculty. Ross
has held the position on an
interim basis since July
1998 while the College con-
ducted a national search for
a successor to former aca-
demic dean Robert Will-
iams.

In making his ah-
nouncement, Vagt said,
“The selection of Dr. Ross
upholds the tradition of hav-
ing asuperb scholar-teacher
lead the academic enterprise
that is central to the mission
of the College.”

when its demands exceed available resources.

In that regard, he feels that the skills of his
chosen profession are well matched to his new
duties. “The heart of economics is making choices
in a world of limited resources,” he said. “That
involves looking broadly at the advantages and
disadvantages of issues and then sorting the priori-
ties. From that point of view, my discipline and
approach are consistent with the challenges of this
new responsibility. The important thing toremem-
ber is that teaching is our mission, and we must
determine priorities with that foremost in mind.”

Ross has also been prepared for his role in
college administration through service on impor-
tant committees such as the advisory council on
finance, the faculty tenure committee, the educa-
tional policy committee, and the faculty executive

committee. He has been a leader in the develop-
ment of international studies on campus through
the Dean Rusk Program in International Studies
and has worked steadfastly for ethnic diversity in
the student body and on the faculty.

A much heralded teacher, Ross won
Davidson’s Omicron Delta Kappa Teaching
Award in 1990 and the Thomas Jefferson Teach-
ing Award in 1991. He is teaching “US Economic
History” this semester and will teach “Labor
History” next fall. He asserted that his new duties
will not keep him out of the classroom. “I feel
strongly that the ‘vice president for academic
affairs should be a teacher,” he said. “I would feel

’Cats celebrate victory over top-seeded UNCG

By Mikt ANDERSON
Sports Editor

The tears that rolled down the cheeks of the
Wildcats on Sunday afternoon do no justice to the
phenomenal season enjoyed by John Filar and the
1998-99 women’s basketball team.

Eventually the tears subsided and the totality
of the picture came into focus, and the pain of the
disappointing defeat gave way to a sense of satis-
faction and pride in season-long accomplishment.

“We knew that we had not just a very special
team,” said head coach John. Filar, “but a special
group of young ladies this year. This is the place
we wanted to be, though not the result we wanted
to have.” But four short years ago, Filar’s Wild-
cats were a fledgling team without a single South-
ern Conference victory in the current decade. Last
Sunday the 1998-99 squad made their mark in
Davidson history, becoming the first women’s
team ever to reach the Southern Conference Tour-
nament championship game.

“I’m really excited that we were able to come
here and build up the program the way we have,
but it’s really hard to end this way,” said senior
Kerry Brown.

The best-ever. tournament performance
capped off an 18-10 season in which the Wildcats
matched last season’s record for the winningest in
program history. Other season highlights included
an invitation to the pre-season WNIT Tourna-
ment, a defeat of the ACC’s Wake Forest Univer-
sity, and a championship trophy from December’s
Roundball Invitational Tournament.

Wildcats comprised four of the ten athletes
recognized out of a field of 130 competing in the
SCT for All-Tournament Team honors. The tena-
cious senior twins, Kerry and Jamie Brown, were
selected to the first team (becoming only the
second and third ‘Cats ever such honored), and
juniors Katy Kamp and Jen O’Brien ‘garnered
second-team recognition.

Davidson earned the fourth seed in the tour-
nament with a conference record of 11-7. This

year’s Southern Conference
regular season was marked by
the most competitive play in
years; only three games sepa-
rated the first and fourth-ranked
teams, and every team in the
conference dropped at least four
contests.

The. Wildcats rolled past

Smith and Furman University
on Friday and then stunned the
tournament's top-seeded UNC-
Greensboro with a spectacular
buzzer-beater on Saturday night
before meeting their match in
Appalachian State University in
Sunday’s championship.

Said Jessica Montrella,
who sat the game out after suf-
fering a serious knee injury ‘in
the semi-final game, “TI still feel
like I didn’t reach a goal and for
me that’s a painful thing. But
the feeling I felt after
(Saturday’s) game might have
been the best feeling of my en-
tire life. To me, I don’t even
know if winning this (cham-

felt as good as it felt last

night. That game was just
the climax of what this team
is. We pulled it together and
laid our hearts on the line to
win that game, and that to
meis the feeling that I needed
to end my season with.”
