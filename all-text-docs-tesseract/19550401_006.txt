Sunday of each week. After Ves-
pers as soon as the cut cards are
signed, the men of policy gather
with Jim Brice, assignment editor,
to decide on the news breaks and
run-of-the-mill info for that week’s
edition. These news leads are put
into form as article assignments
and sent to various men of abili-
ties ambiguiously termed “re-
porters.”

The reporters are chosen from
a list of names found on Union in-
formation sheet No. 96, entitled,
“All interested in writing for the
Davidsonian, sign here.” All who
sign are selected. Of the 75 to 80
who signed on the dotted line this
year, about thirty compose the
actual writing staff of the paper.
Half of these are used each week.
4rticle deadline is early Wednes-
day night.

The office staff, usually com-
posed of the entire Davidsonien
roster as found on page two of
every edition, then gathers to-
gether Wednesday night to edit,
rewrite, strike out indecent or
radical ideas, and meditate on the
half page of blank space which
has to be filled by closing time.
Three writers in the double roll
of news snoops track down articles,
mop up spare headlines, and dust
off unused leavings from other
papers. Here also are written with
anguish and chuckles the head-
lines, captions, and sub-liner copy.
Copy editor, John Harmon, care-
fully scrutinizes incoming material,
putting his JTH on all that meets
the high qualifications of printa-
ble publications. Much could be
scribbled about this hub of in.
terest that buzzes with all curious
forms of students, but one must
see for himself. There is never a
dull moment in finishing off the
stuff thet passes into print to be
“tasted, chewed, or thoroughly di-
gested.”

EDITORIAL

It is the editorial page of the
newspaper which allows, for the
exchange of ideas of individuals
on the news and issues of the
day as opposed to the reporting of
current events on the news pages.

Each week the editor and the
managing editor confer and de-
termine what aspects of the week’s
news should be discussed that
week. Following this it is the duty
of the managing editor to eontact
capable writers who can express
the paper's views on these sub-
jects. At times the managing edi-
tor contacts writers and allows
them to select their own topics
and express their own views on
these subjects.

The official policy of the David
sonian is expressed by the “edi-
torials” which are always found
at the left of the editorial page.
These are usually written by the
editor-in-chief but are occasional-
ly written at his suggestion by as-
sociate and managing editors.
These editorials alone should be
considered the paper’s official
stand on the various issues.

Each year the Davidsonien has
several outstanding senior writers
who are usually given a standard
assignment to write regularly. In
this category this year is the well
known column “Cracks in the
Cloister.”

Also familiar to the editorial
page reader are the cartoons.
These are sometimes drawn by
local artists and at other times
are received from the Associated
Collegiate Press.

A full page may be devoted to
a single subject such as the segre-
gation symposium this year. Such
subjects require more careful plan-
ning than regular issues.

GUSINESS STAFF
The paper you are now reading
was founded in 1914 with a feature
staff. Later a business staff was
added to help deal with the
numerous management problems
of the paper. Many efficient busi-

————ee

ness staffs have preceded the one
whose members now work on the
newspaper, but the five men who
compose the staff are doing as good

(or better) a job of handling the}

paper's advertising, circulation,
and collecting problems as have
the members of preceding business
staffs.

The advertisements for the Dae
sidsonian are obtained from two
main sources, those being a local
source, and a national source of
advertising represented by Nation-
al Advertising Service. Inc. The
local advertisers have their places
of business in Charlotte and
vicinity. Outstanding among con-
tributors are: Wilson-Wright Cloth-
ing Store, Parker-Gardner. Moores-
ville Creamery, the Connoisseur,
and the Davidson Theater (until
the catastrophe). Outstanding na-
tional contributors are: the Coca-
Cola Bottling Company, Winston.
Camel, L. & M., and Chesterfield
cigarettes.

Our college apportions $3.75 per
student each year out of the Stu-
dent Activities Fee to run the pa-
per, and usually this is enough.
Other financial sources are the pa-
per’s advertisers. At the end of
every year, all money over $200.00
is paid to the Publications Board
Fund. This money is used in the
following school year. to aid the
functioning of all faltering publi-
cations.

Outside subscriptions to the pa-
per are $2.00 per year. Student
subscriptions are covered in the
Student Activities Fee. Alumni
subscription blanks are sent out
with the letters to Davidson grad-
uates.

Last year the paper under the
able business management of C.
Hasty operated in the black, for
they paid the $200.00 to the Pub-
ications Fund. Following in- the
set precedent. the staff of this
year’s Davidsonian hopes to
operate again in the black.

The members of the business
staff are: T. Cooper, business man-
ager; L. Parrott, advertising man-
ager; T. Taylor. assistant busi-
ness manager: B. Carmichael, cir-
culation manager; L. Wright. col-
lections manager.

PRINTING PROCESS

The aatual transformation of the
Davidson mind and spirit in hal-
towed black and white is the phase
of the Oavidsonian story toward
which all other sections and con-
tingents must eventually point.
There is no heavier hand to a
writer or crusader than one which
must alter, because of physical
limitations of size and space (and
good judgment), the culmination
of many hours dedicated work or
fervent bid for the prestige and
reputation of a budding “great”
in the printing ink world.

The pictures to appear in any
week's issue are first sent to Char-
lotte’s Arts Engraving Company to
be transformed to either mats or
engravings. All printing is done
by the Davidson Printing Co. Mr.
H. C. Broyles, linotypist, setting all
type. A galley proof of the articles
is first run off and proof read
by Mrs. Broyles. Thursday after-
noon or Friday morning, Crouse.
Warlick, and Holshouser, page edi-
tors, supervise their respective
page compositions of the type: and
it is here that additions, subtrac-
tions, and divisions are made in the
copy for page balance and comple-
tion. A final page proof is made
for corrections and the forms are
then said to be closed on the press
and the lines locked in the print-
ing frame. After a few trial runs
and checks, the press is started
and a tired editor begins again his
worries about next week.

Folding is carried out by hand
under the supervision of Bob
Carmichael, circulation manager,
who “employs” ATO pledges and
Court of Control delinquents.
Final distribution and mailing ends
with many an editor’s sigh and
writer’s prayer.

Subsidization Forum . Students Asked to Help

Sel for Wednesday

President J. R. Cunningham will
lead a “Facts Forum on Athletic
Subsidization” next Wednesday in
the College Union ballroom.

All members of the student body
are invited to participate in the
discussion, which will include clari-
fication of any questions arising
over statements in this issue of
the Davidsonian concerning the
school’s future athletic policy.

Omicron Delta Kappa is spon-
soring the forum as an endeavor
to inform students of the admin-
istration’s athletic subsidization
plans, a vital question on the cam-
pus for several months.

The meeting will begin at 7 p.m.

Keep Campus Sightly

Having been Superintendent of
Buildings and Grounds over a
period of years I take pride in try-
ing to keep our campus beautiful.
When parents of students and
visitors come to our campus
we want them to have a favorable
first impression. Too many un-
necessary paths, paper cups and
paper detract from the natural
beauty. As Superintendent I am
suggesting that all of us try to fol-
low the campus walks. We are
planning to place reminders at
places where paths would be un-
sightly. Your cooperation § in
achieving these objectives will be
greatly appreciated.—F. D. Hobart,
Superindent
Grounds.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Davidsonian Celebrates 41s! Birthday |Franeh Scholars Hold

HARMON

Last Tuesday evening at the home of Dr. George Watts,
members of Le Cercle Francais enjoyed what has been termed
by some as the highlight of the spring social season thus far.
This session of the spiritual sons of Louis XIV et al, was char-
acterized by a brilliant display of sparkling wit, penetrating
intelligence, and calculated cooperation on the part.of all
present to make the evening an unforgettable event.

After the singing of the “Mar.
seillaise,” President Summers ad-
dressed a few well-chosen words
to the group. They were apparent-

ly not well chosen, however, for’

Summers had to be reminded by
alert John Harmon that he had
failed to acknowledge the presence
of a new member, Bill Martin
More about that later. Next, Dick
Morehead called the roll, after
which he commented about the ex-
cellent attendance at the meeting.

‘Dr. Goldiere called attention to

an error which occured in the sub-
sequent reading of the minutes of
the last session; the nature of this
error escapes the writer at the
moment, and therefore must not
have been very important.
« Secretary Morehead had the last
laugh, however, when Vice-Presi-
dent and Program Chairman Har-
mon arose to introduce those par-
ticipating in the program. With
his usual noble spirit of defense of
the down-trodden, he pointed out
to the group the fact that Dr.
Goldiere himself had made an er-
ror in -the printing of the cards
which announced the meeting. In-
stead of signing Secretary More-
head's first name “Dick,” he
signed it “Andy.” [ft seems that
this error was caused by some
psychological lapse of memory on
the part of Dr. Goldiere, for he
confused Morehead’s name with
that of “Andy Morehouse”’ (or
“Outhouse” or something like that)
of several years past. Anyhow, Dr.
Goldiere offered profuse apologies
to the group and the otherwise un-
forgivable error was forgiven.

Program Chairman Harmon then
continued his introduction of the
program with some delightful com-
ments concerning how happy he
was to see ‘everybody again, ete.
Then he personally welcomed Bil!
Martin into the fellowship, and
apologized for the notable omission
of such a welcome earlier during
the meeting.

On the first part of the program,
George Scott, Emory Kimbrough,
and Jack Crymes read with beauti-
ful and emotional tenderness three
beautiful. emotional, and tender
poems from the nineteenth-century
French poets, Victor Hugo and
Lamartine.

Next followed a play, “Cupidon
Dentiste” (which being translated
means “Cupig, the Dentist") by
Pierre Macy. The actors for this
performance were Bill Kuykendall,
Dick Pyle, Bill Martin, Charlie
Robinson, Dick Morehead, and Tom
Warlick. This play was. not pre-
sented as a closet drama, but

rather in acted fashion. The star
of the show was Dick Pyle, who
played the part of a beautiful
young girl visiting the dentist for
a regular check-up. He was
dressed in the manner of a roar-
ing-twenties courtesan, complete
with red hat, and he really looked
the part. This beautiful young
belle’s dashing suitor was played
by Bill Martin, who had come to
the dentist with an acute toothache,
but who upon falling in love with
Pyle, had become immediately
cured.

If the club had given an Oscar
for the best performance, Tom
Warlick, the dentist, would. un-
doubtedly have been the recipient.
He appeared on the stage after
both his patients, pierced by the
arrow of Cupid and cured by the
elixir of love, had decided not to
use his dental services.. In a
dramatic soliloquy, he lamented (in
French, and of course everything
in French sounds tike a lament)
the fact that Cupid proved to be
a better dentist than he. In the
after-theatre discussion, the ex-
perts compared Warlick’s solilo-
quy to that of Gielgud doing Ham-
let in point of dramatic empathy
and directness.

After the presentation of the pro-
gram, the entire group' joined in
a 45-minute singing bout, led by
Dr. Watts. After the sing, Program
Chairman Harmon had another lit-
tle surprise up his sleeve in the
form of a contest to determine who
could unravel some scrambled
names of French cities in the
shortest while and with the great-
est degree of accuracy. Bil! Kuy-
kendall won the prize, which con-
sisted of an extra bit of cake
stolen from the refreshment table.

After the contest, the hostesses,
Mrs. Goldiere and Mrs. Watts, sum-
moned the group into the dining
room where delicious ambrosia and
nectar had been prepared. While
eating, the members formed into
little cliques and discussed  in-
dividually the aesthetic and in-
tellectual subjects in which they
tried to look interested. About 10
o'clock, someone suggested that
it was time to leave since he and
others had yet to translate their
French for Wednesday morning.
Acting upon this suggestion, all the
members except Dr. and Mrs.
Watts (who were already at home)
soon left, commenting enthusiasti-
cally on the way to their respective
domiciles about the stimulating
and uplifting catharsis they had
just experienced.

Phi-Eu Compeiition
To Be Held Monday

Davidson’s two literary societies,
Eumanean and Philanthropic, will
vie Monday night in the annual
competition for possession of the
Phi-Eu Cup, a_ silver trophy
awarded each year since 1912 to
the winner of several literary con-
tests.

A faculty committee will judge
groups of poems and short stories
and an extemporaneous debate on
subjects to be presented by Pro-
fessor B. J, Wilson.

Eumanean Society has retained
the cup for a number of years,
and President Tom Dove cockily
states, “We positively intend to
keep it, one way or another.” Phi
President Mac Williamson could
not be reached for comment be.
fore the Davidsonian went to press.

The Phi-Eu Competition has not
been held for several years. The
meeting two years ago was broken
up by a campus riot and authori-
tles felt it safer not to risk a con-
test last year.

The competition will begin at
8:16 p.m., and all members of both
organizations are urged to attend.

not beyond reason that the confer-

is an interesting team, and they
deserve support this weekend.

The virtuoso has also become a
favorite of radio listeners and
record devotees. He is the only
one of the younger generation of
pianists to be included in the
Telephone Hour “family,” and he
is frequently heard on N.B.C.'s
“Standard Hour” from California
and A.B.C.’s “Piano Playhouse.”
His choice recordings for Concert
Hall and Vox include albums of
Schumann, Beethoven, Schubert,
Grieg. and the complete Chopin
“Polonaises.” During the summer
season Grant Johannesen plays in’
concerts in the Hollywood Bowl,
Grant Park in Chicago, and in the
time honored Chautauqua con-
certs.

Mr. Johannesen has just re-
turned from a series of European
performances: where he played in
the great concert halls of Vienna,
Munich, Hamburg, Copenhagen,
and Oslo. Erling Westher in the
Oslo “Arbeiderbladet” paid the
pianist the following tribute:

“All the small and great things
that combine to create a perfect
artistic performance and that we
so often miss were here present
and actually made this concert one
of my greatest musical experi-
ences.

“Equally hopeless as the at-
tempt to define art is the attempt
to explain what makes one artist’s
performance superior to all others.
One may mention all the well-
known things, like perfect tech.

rich and perfect range of sound,

these are only words. Grant

sesses the undefinable which is
‘unique, even among the world’s
