Chemistry department earns:
$6500 educational grant

Chemistry Department has
received a $6500 grant from
the Committee on Educational

| Aid of the Dupont Company.

“We are very grateful and
proud to-have received this
vote of confidence in our
chemistry program,’’ said
Department Chairman J.

.. Nicholas Burnett.

“It is a grant like this that

- shelps to enrich our program

above and beyond the limits of
our annual budget,”’ he said.
The Dupont grant, the se-
cond received by the Chemis-
try Department in as many
years, is awarded in recogni-

tion of the Department’s
quality faculty, the quality of
the students within the de-
partment, the graduate
records of Davidson’s chemis-
try majors and the chemistry
curriculum itself.

The department has not yet
decided where the grant mo-
ney will go.

Last year’s grant, also
$6500, was used as matching
money to obtain an additional
$8000 grant from the North
Carolina Science and Techno-
logy Committee.

The combined grant money
purchased a $15,000 Infrared
Spectrometer, badly needed
for research within the depart-
ment.

t 1s a stipulation of the
grant that the money cannot
be used for the rénovation of
Martin Science Building.

“The Martin Science facili-
ties are old and worn from 38
years of use,’’ said Burnett.
“It’s not impossible to study
chemistry in them; we just
can’t do as good and efficient a
job as we could in a more
modern building.

“T think the grant was given
in the hope of improving our
situation with more modern
equipment.”

Commenting on the renova-
tion of Martin, Burnett said
that ‘‘it takes time to raise the
amount of money needed. I am
not discouraged. The pros-
pects are looking better.”’

The Screening Committee,
chairea by Parliamentarian
Percy Badham, considered
nineteen students for the six
positions. They presented ten
candidates to the Senate.

The great interest in the
Council stemmed from its
decision on the Rusk House.
Matters concerning the Court
dominated Senate questioning
even though this is only one
area of the Council’s respon-
sibility.

The two women appointed,

. Franklin and Howard, were

Thurs. -Fri.

members of the Council this
year. Howard, a member of
Emanon this year; has joined
Rusk House for next year.
Franklin was the only inde-
pendent appointed.

Franklin was supported in
part because she represented
several unique viewpoints, in-
cluding women, blacks, and
independents. She stated,
however, that she could re-
present other opinions as well.

Payne was head of the
freshman group that was seek-
ing the Rusk House. He said
that he wanted a position on
the Council. He was impressed
by the power of the Council
and concerned with the misuse
of that power.

He said that he was ap-
palled by the lack of expertise
of several of the Council
members and that he would go
‘the extra mile’’ to gain the
information on Council mat-
ters. He received much sup-
port in the Senate because he
was the only fréshman candi-
date, and has considerable
knowledge of the activities of
the Council.

Gladden is a KA and a hall

enate selects six to Council

counselor. He was praised for
being very poised and moder-
ate in his opinions.

Boswell is a KA, a member
of the Hearing Committee,
and on the tennis team. He
was questioned very intently
about his role as a member of
the KA House. He supports
the option of a girls’ eating
house and is opposed to the
Council’s goal of all coed
houses. He'felt that alumni
would not support a move in
that direction.

Sims is an SAE. He said’
that he offered himself as an
individual and not as a mem-
ber of a certain group. Stating
that the college had made a
commitment to coeducation,
he supported ‘the goal of coed
houses for the Court. Senator
Hans Watford (Sentelle)
praised Sims for not having
“vested interests’’ and for
speaking diplomatically.

The Screening Committee
presented Bruce T. Brown,
Marshall Brown, Jack Davis,
and Merideth Durden as can-
didates for the Alumni Affairs

Committee. The Senate ap-
pointed them unanimously.

Bob Cathey appeared before
the Senate concerning his
petition that the Senate con-
sidered last week. His group is
doing further research and will
indicate their plans at a later
date.

President Thom Young /
praised Cathey and his group |
for their concern and their’
attempt to act on that con-_
cern. The Senate applauded
Young’s remarks.

Young presented an amend-
ment to the College Constitu-
tion that would make the
president of Patterson Court
Council an ex facto member of
the Council on Campus and
Religious Life.

The amendment must have
two readings before the Senate
and then a vote of approval
from the student body before
it takes effect.

The second Screening Com-
mittee, chaired by Watford,
begins interviewing this week
for positions on the Guidance
and Student Counseling Com-
mittee, Library Committee,
Physical Education Commit-
tee, and the Admissions and
Financial Aid Committee.
