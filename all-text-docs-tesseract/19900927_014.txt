Field Hockey

Field Hockey Beats

Appalachi

an State,

Ties Radford

By LARRY DAGENHART

Last Weckend, the Davidson
field hockey tcam took a road trip
which resulted in a 1-0 victory
over Appalachian State and ascore-
less uc with Radford.

The lone goal of the game
against Appalachian State was
scored by Jacquclin Ukrop mid-
way through the first half. Ukrop
lifted the ball over fallen goal-
keeper Libba Shannonhouse, re-
nowncd for her stingincss in goal.

Davidson dominatcd the game
by outshooting the Mountaincers
36-7. A rough ficld containing more
than a few wecds madc it difficult
for both tcams to move the ball
well, but the Wildcats werc able to
up their record to 4-1.

Sunday’s game against
Radford matched Davidson against
ahost of great players accustomed
toaphysical game anda very tough
schedule.

Radford controlled the firsthalf
as it outshot the Wildcats 19-1.
Davidson, playing without starters
Simonc Plaisance and Beth Pharr,
battled back in the second halfand
actually outshot Radford 5-2. There
was still no score aftcr regulation,
and the game moved into over-
ume. Incollege hockey, teams play
onc 10 minute period, followed by
a 10 minute sudden death period if
the score is still tied.

If there was a play of the game
for the Wildcats, it came at the end
of the first overtime period. With

the clock ticking down the final 15
seconds, a Radford player collided
witha Davidson player in the circle
and drew an honest penalty; the
official awarded her a deserved
penalty stroke. Radford, which had
riddled the game with yelling,
cursing and overall poor conduct,
knew that time was-soon to expire
and a succcssful penalty stroke in
the goal would win the game. The
recipient of the penalty stroke for
Radford player was, apparently,
told by a teammate to feign an
injury in order to stop the clock so
Radford could setup its “play.” On

the penalty stroke, the Radford |

hitter tapped the ball about one
foot in front of her, and immedi-
atcly began consulting her team-
mates on whether or not to run the
play from the endline on the other
side of the goal. While Radford
players headed to face the other
side of and Radford fell apart,”
added the coach.

NOTE: The Davidson Athlete
of the Weck award goes to sopho-
more ficld hockcy player Jennifer
Roos for her great defense, corner
hits, goals, her many defensive

saves that would otherwise have .

been goals for opponents, and her
overall superb play.

Davidson ficld hockey is home
for three in a row. After Wednes-
day’s game with Salem College,
the Wildcats play Pfeiffer College
this Friday and High Point College
on Wednesday. Game times are
4:30.

Men's Golf

Golf Places Eighth

_______ With all of the talk around
campus about the success of foot-
ball, volleyball, field hockey, and
mcn’s socccr, the men’s golf team
has been unfortunately ignored.
Therefore, the golf team has not
gottcn any of the credit that they
deserve, because they too have had
an impressive fall season.

This past weckend the team
played in Gcorgetown’s “Hoya
Invitational” in Fredricksburg,
Virginia. The tournament was won
by Princeton, but Davidson placed
eighth out of fifteen teams.

Davidson’s total of 626 for the
weekend put them only five shots
out of fourth place, and was also
the best two round total that
Davidson has had in the last five
years ese ae
Captain Mike Maggart led the
team, shooting a 73 and a 76 to
finish in seventh place in the 75

man field. His total of 149 puthim
only two shots out of second place.

Three freshmen also had im-
pressive showings over the week-
end. Will McDanicl hadatwo-day
total of 152 and Will Coble had a
total of 154.

Mark Raber shot a 161, but he
also had one of the best shots of the
tournament, holing a 120 yard shot
with a seven iron. The shot was
impressive not only because of the
distance, but also because the right-
handed Raber used his left handed
shot to lift the ball up from beside
a tree.

Coach Gordon Mietz has built
a strong team that ranks as one of
the best that Davidson has had in
years.

Next Sunday through Tues-
day the team travels to Campbell
for the Hargrove B. Davis Invita-
tional.

By WALTER WRAY

Duke Blue Devils and dropping a
one-goal decision to the Hokies of
Virginia Tech, the women’s soc-
cer tcam finds itself winless at0-5-
1.

But with Sarah Way finding the
net against Duke, Jennifer Satter-
field learning quickly in the
midfield, and Lisa LeNard and Liz
Clarke anchoring - the ‘defense,

things are not all bad for the Wild-
cats.

tories begins following the team’s
trip to Washington D. C. for the
WAGS-Real Vodicka Tournament
over Fall Break, Oct.5 and6. |

The women’s soccer program

top talent by offcring the unique
situation of Division I competition
ata first-rate academic liberal arts

“The team is young, but they
understand the circumstances,
which are natural for a second-
year program,” states coach Diane
Boettcher.

Smiling, Maria Tucker forecasts
a brighter day for the team,”In
October we’re going to wina lotof
games,” adding diplomatically, “I
think.”

Intramurals

Flickerball-The Sunday

By JASON BRANNON

Fall is just about here. The
birds are flying South, the leaves
are changing color, and the morm-
ings are becoming quite cool. But
what better signal of the coming
autumn is there than the recent

arrival of the football. As the local___and-Give, had_played_only_one—

college programs settle into their
weekly regimen, so do the students
on the Davidson campus, for the
fall marks the start of the intramu-

ral year. Fall intramurals means .

Flickerball to the Davidson cam-
pus, and Flickerball means that
twisted, football-like game that
often serves the dual role of enter-
tainment and Sunday afternoon
hangover remedy.

Two weeks into the season,
the veterans seem to have shaken
off the ill effects of their long

‘summer layoff, and the freshmen

appear to be learning quickly,

though on a trial-by-fire basis. As ,

expected, a few of the more expe-
rienced teamsare off to very strong
starts. D.F.W.B. F’d.W. (ask a
PIKA) 3rd and Long, thumping
them 52-6, and left the Old Drink-
ing Buddies choking on their own

backwash ina27-25 squeaker. Just _

Average Guys, perhaps the pre-

season favorite, gunned down the
Young Guns III by forfeit, and
then spanked the Butt Pirates, 46-
6. U Can’t Touch This, also 2-0,
“hammered” The Legends, 40-13,
and then needed only six guys to
drill Nookie Shtang, 27-7. Another
traditionally powerful team, Drop

- game as of Tuesday, beating a
eo

n the women’s league, the
action has proved to be equally
exciting. The Wappa Happas join

Ramblers as the only unde-
eated teams through two games,
with WH beating Basement Rich
by forfeit and The Cult, 6-0, and
the Ramblers whitewashing The
Hypothetical Team, 6-0. and 1st
Rich, 13-0. The Old Ladies won
their only game, rocking The Cult,
20-0. e

Other results: Smurfs, Inc. beat
the Blue Dogs by forfeit; Built for
Comfort relaxed in a 44-14 win
over Nookie Shtang; Ist Rich
outscored the 3rd Thirds, 19-12;
the Butt Pirates beat the Old Drink-

ing Buddies by forfeit; Crunch ‘N.

Munch wore out the Love Mus-
sels, 51-25; Kickin’ Cannon con-
demned Animal House in a 6-0
victory. ‘The Thundering Herd

Remember to look. at your
schedules for referee times. If the
refs for your team don’t show up
for their assigned games, then your
team will forfeit the day’s game.
The second time this happens, your
team will be suspended from the
post-scason tournament. Keep in
mind that as well as being a great
hangover remedy, a perfect alter-
native to those monotonous 12-
ounce curls for exercise, and a
prime opportunity to show each.
other what competitive jerks we
can be, Flickerball is supposed to
be fun. Judy Krenzer, Sterling
Martin, and IMAC co-chairs Larry
Dagenhart and Josh Wheliss are
working hard to make it that way
for everyone, so just do your part.
and look forward to a smoothly-
run Flickerball season.
