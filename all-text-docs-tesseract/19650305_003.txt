THE DAVIDSONIAN

DRAWS FAVORABLE COMMENTS

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

After two weeks under
the “new ROTC” system,
a great deal of interest,
comment, and _ criticism
have been heard concerning
the activities centered in the
basement of Belk.

The changes, reported in last
week's DAVIDSONIAN, basical-
ly entail delayed drill, revised
weapons cleaning periods, and
improved classroom teaching
methods,

When asked how the improve-
ments were decided upon, Col.

Library |
‘Weeds’
Volumes

Frederick B, Outlaw, professor
of military science, said, “The
critique sheets handed to cadets
were the major tools in the
newest changes. They were care-
fully examined, categorized, and
evaluated for hours and hours,
before we came up with any-
thing‘ definite.”

Outlaw continued, ‘“‘We tried
to tailor these innovations to pro-
vide a more equitable applica-
tion of our resources. We feel
we've made some _ improve-
ments, and we're making more
all the time.”

His philosophy is that every-
thing can be improved, and
these changes are but a part of
a general evaluation and im-
provement of the Davidson

| ROTC program.

LATE ORILL

Said Capt. Robert Crittendon
on the delayed drill, ‘I think

The college library staff, in| everyone realizes that at least

co-operation with the faculty,

has carried out a thorough and |’

continuous ‘‘weeding’’ of the
stacks, in order to keep the col-
lection substantially free of ob-
solete material, according to
Library Director Chalmers
Davidson.

The ‘weeding’ process, ac-
cording to Davidson, has. en-
abled the library to ‘‘maintain
an alive, well-selected, appropri-
ate selection throughout the past
two decades.”

In a partial answer to criti-
cism of the school’s inadequate
collection of books, Davidson
pointed out that the present total
of 105,000 volumes could easily
have been brought to 200,000
over the years, if it were not
for the high degree of discrimi-
nation which has been shown in
accepting gifts of books and in
retaining old volumes.

most 4,300 volumes have been
simply discarded. The Univer-
sity of the South, a college with
only a slightly larger library
than Davidson, has found itself
faced with the problem of under-

Since 1945, for example, =|

taking a crash program of].

“weeding” out obsoleté books
and documents because of its
failure to maintain a policy such
as Davidson's in the past.

Davidson also noted that over
the same 20-years period, over
2,000 volumes have been stolen
or have otherwise disappeared
from the open stacks, with the
year 1962-63 showing a. record
total of 234 books missing.

Among recent acquisitions to
the library have been some 700
rare volumes contributed over
the past year by collecter H. M.
Marvin of New Haven, Conn.
Dr. Harvin, a Davidson gradu-
ate of 1914, has shown a con-
tinuing interest in supplying the
school with many rare and beau-
tiful editions.

The limited editions are usual-
ly numbered and frequently
signed. Among the list are many
from Bruce Rogers and the Gol-
den Cockerel Press.

Examples of the more recent
shipments include Pretude fo a
Million Years, a book of wood
engraving by Lynd Ward, The
Complete Angles, by Bruce Rog-
ers, A Book-Lover’s Bouquet, by
Edward L. Stone, Zastrozzi, a
romance by Percy Bysshe Shel-
ly, and The Trees, by Conrad
Richter.

one of the reasons for delaying
drill an extra half-hour is to en-
able those students with fourth-
period classes to prepare for
drill and still get something to
eat. But there is another reason:
we think this will give the jun-
iors and seniors time to prepare
better for their leadership po-
sitions."’

Comments noted from stu-
dents followed. From a fresh-
man, “If we had to be on the
field at 1:30, I'd never make it—
there's just not enough time to
do everything and eat, too."

This word from a senior, ‘I
can't see too much to be gained
by this pre-drill meeting for all
officers and NCO’s. They should

know by then what's going to
come off. The other changes are
great, though."’-

RIFLE CARE

Outlaw and his staff have
taken a giant step forward, if
general opinion is any measure
of success. The program is defi-
nitely more realistic now than
before, as evidenced by the re-
vised schedule for cleaning wea-
pons. Capt. Harold Fraley point-
ed out that the critiques were
especially helpful here.

Reports that the ‘usual
checks" were a waste of time
and energy prompted an investi-
gation to determine whether or
not. weapons necded such at-
tention. “It was found,” he said,
“that a field-strip cleaning and
lubrication would protect the
weapons if done every other
week."’

Student reaction was nearly
entirely in favor of this change.
“It was pretty common knowl-
edge,’’ remarked a junior, ‘‘that
almost everybody just went
down to the armory to sign his
initials without even looking at
his rifle. That was just a waste
of time, and meant a rifle some-
times went three weeks without
being cleaned or looked at."

e

INSTRUCTION

The changes not only affect
the drill period every Tuesday,
but also and perhaps.more im-
portant the classroom instruc-
tion. ROTC classes meet only
one or two hours a week, and
therefore must make every use
of the instructors and equip-
ment available.

.program is now moving towards

LL

ROTC Makes Changes |.

Explained Crittendon, “‘Col.
Outlaw has reassigned us in re-
gard to teaching duties; the
man with the most experience
in a field will teach in the class-
room about that subject."

This change, as all of the
others, is in the best interest
of the student for whom the
course is intended.

The schedule and procedure
is generally now considered
more practical and thoughtful
of the cadet in the ROTC pro.
gram.

Perhaps the best example of
this fact is the recent innovation
in the merits/demerits system:
the cadet cannot be issued any
merits or demerits without al

full explanation why and writ-|
ten notification of them.

NEW PROGRAM

Moreover, it is evident that j
the ROTC teaching staff is a!
more dynamic organization than
it has been in the past. The

definite far-sighted changes in
what was often dubbed as a
lethargic program.

These and other changes and
new. ideas to come, such as the
NCO school, Special Forces, and
sophomore /freshman  maneu-
vers, will perhaps erase the dull,
crip-course label so often associ-
ated with the program here.

In the words of one sopho.
more, “‘It’s even getting excit-
ing at timest”" Exciting—well,
maybe when they show the war
flicks, but at least now the cadet
can see some purpose in the

course and some hint of a prac- |'

tical and efficient organization.

First By-laws Created

Freshman having cars second semester, by-laws for the Freshman Council, a }

By GREY PASH
Davidsonian Staff Writer

For Freshman Council

committee for Freshman social life and changes in the freshman regulations are
currently being discussed at the Freshman Council meetings on Thursday nights.

The representative body of
the Freshman Class has been
investigating, evaluating. and
formulating ideas and proposals
concerning their purpose in re-
relation to the Freshman Class.

BY-LAWS

One of the most important
actions taken by the Council has
been to set up by-laws. There
have previously been no by-
laws for the Council. A commit-
tee headed by Frank Shepard
has collected materials from the
past relating to the job of the
Freshman Council and is now in
the process of writing a set of
by-laws.

Explained President Tom
Irons, ‘“‘When we were elected
last fall we didn't know where
to start. There were no by-laws
or written rules. All we had to
go on was what had been hand-
ed down by old members of the
Council. We hope that these by-
laws will better define our pur-
pose and be an aid to future
council members.”

REGULATIONS

Another committee, headed by
Tom Pope, has been evaluating
the existing freshman regula-
tions. After further study, which

is to include evaluation forms
filled out by each council mem-
ber and his hall, the council
hopes to be able to present some
suggestions to the Student Coun-
cil for amendments to the regu-
lations.

Another important study in the
making is that of Freshman

social life. Their work has been
temporarily discontinued be-
cause of overlapping with the
report of the Fraternity Evalua-
tion Committee. but some of the
suggestions already made in-
clude a budget for the Fresh-
man Council (they now use Un-
ion funds when available),
council contro! of the Queens and
Converse mixers, and a social
committee for freshmen.

CARS FOR FROSH

Another proposal somewhat
related to social life, that of;
Freshmen having ears on camp-
us second semester, was brought
up at the last Student Council
meeting by Irons. It too has!
been tabled until after the report;
of the Fraternity Committee.

Trons, president of the council
and a recently sworn-in member
of the Student Council is pleased
with the Freshman Council's
work, ‘We feel that now we are

coming closer to our purpose
as we see it—bringing the prob-
lems of the freshman (o the
Administration acting as a
liaison.”'

exchange program between Amherst and David-

Son.

Those chosen include John Barrow, Danny
Boone, Charlie Dibble, Jay Federman, Tom Frist,
Tommy Heffner, David Powell, and Ted Pulliam.

The eight, chosen by

the Student Council, will

participate in an expense-free program in which
the host school provides room and board. Arrange-
ments have been made to use student cars for trans-

portation.

The participants will be at Amherst during
their Spring Vacation beginning March 27. Tommy
Heffner, program coordinator, said that Amherst
has set no definite agenda for the Davidson stu-

dents at. this time.

The delegates from the Massachusettes college

will be at Davidson March

21-27. Davidson students

will house them in their rooms and serve as hosts.
They will eat at fraternity houses and the College
Union and attend classes and seminars.

This is the fourth year Amherst has conducted
an exchange with a Southern college.

‘EDUCATION NOT CENSORSHIP’

Nash, ‘Tom Jones’ Provoke Gastonians

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Two Gastonia citizens
made their plea for their
own particular brand of cen-
sorship last Tuesday night
in what was termed a “coun-
ter to Mrs. Nash,” referring

to the recent visit of Dr..

Ethel Nash.

Bill Williams. associate edi-
tor of the Gastonia Gazette, and
Carl Stewart, a young Gastonia
attorney, represented a sheriff's
committee of 15 citizens appoint-
ed to educate the public in the

‘field of censorship of magazines
and books and to aid enforce-
ment of North Carolina's de-
cency law.

In a DAVIDSONIAN interview,

Williams attempted to dispel
a common misconception about
himself and his cohorts: ‘People
have the wrong idea. They think
we're a bunch of censors.” The
purpose of the committee, he
added, was actually “to try to
educate the public.”’ Stewart
said the committee wished to
“promote the dissemination of
non-obscene literature.”

At the start of the program,
Williams apparently blundered
commenting that “It was the
movie Tom Jones that really
kicked this thing off.’’ Noting
the negative reaction of his audi-
ence, Williams barged ahead
with “If this is the best movie
America has produced this past
year, then what in hell is the
worst?”

Williams then yielded the floor
to Stewart, who gave a brief
background summary of federal
and state laws on tlie subject.
Stewart then introduced the
evening's main feature, a movie
made by the Citizens for Decent
Literature (CDL) committee in
Ohio.

The film ranks with other
comedy classics that have ap-
peared here, such as !rma la
Douce and The Pink Panther.
As the. audience roared and ap-
plauded wildly at the film's
more fantastic moments, it was
almost impossible to believe the
film was meant seriously.

Such incredible cliches as
“This moral decay weakens our
resistance to the onslaught of the
Communist threat,"’ and ‘‘wild
flagrant abuses of the God-given

gift of sex’’ were only a pre-
lude to a set of magnificent gen
eralizations whose scope was ex-
ceeded only by their impossibil-
ity to prove, including “This
moral decay caused 16 of the 17
major civilizations to vanish
from the earth.”

The finale came with a gran-
deur beyond our wildest dreams,
however, when at the end of the
film the narrator gazed intently
at the camera and said with the
fervor of a. religious fanatic.
“Oh God. deliver us, America,
from Evil."

In a slightly anti-climactic
presentation, Williams ended his
portion of the program by evad-.
ing several student questions re-
garding his condemnation of
Tom Jones (‘I don’t want to get

into that."*) and by wisely turn
ing over the question session to
Stewart.

Stewart seemed at ease, and
quickly found a rapport with his
audience with his more liberal
views on the subject. After
avowing that his idea was to
“eut down on the dissemination
of the worst type of this litera
ture,” he introduced two major
modifications of the conservative
position expressed by. Williams
and the film.

First, he stated, it is much
better to err in the direction of
not enough censorship than too
much, and second, education is
much more important thdn cen-
sorship, which treats a ‘“‘cause,
not a symptom.”

By PHILIP B. SECOR
A Davidsonian Review

of the effect the work has had upon me.

The weakness of this kind of
“review” is that you may have
difficulty distinguishing the au-
thor from the reviewer. The ad-
vantage is that you may come
close to the spirit of the work
being reviewed.

I know very little about Paul
Goodman. I have read none of
his other books and only a few
of his articles. I know that he is
an'important and controversial
American writer who will visit
Davidson next week and that
some people say he is a “‘way-

Jout"’ writer. This particular
| work, Utepian Essays and Prac-
‘tical Proposals is most definite
ly not *‘way out.”
| In fact, it is one of the few—
| and perhaps the only—book by a
‘contemporary American social
critic which is really in way-in.
‘Why I think this and what I
mean by ‘‘in’’. I shall now en
deavor to show.

Popular books of social criti-
cism which Ahis book is—tend
to be analytically descriptive
and critical (e.g.. Vance Pack-
ard), Another type of social crit-
icism — scarcely worthy of the
name —is the irrelevantly moral
istic piece (I wouldn't dream
of giving an example!) ;

Thus, books on social life tend
to be either realistic or utopian:
they are never both realistic and
ethical. This is because modern
than has divided the descriptive
and the prescriptive functions of
language and decreed that they
must remain separated. And, in
brief, this is Paul Goodman's
gripe. And his strength, it seems
to me, is that he has tried with
some success to write a work of
social criticism which unites de-
scription and prescription.

GOODMAN OBJECTS

As I read Goodman, he ob-
jects strongly to the modern ten-
dency (compulsion) to identify
the clean, objective and sterile
descriptions of life with our mor-
al attitudes about life. This, he
correctly sees, results in a re-
signed and fatalistic attitude
about whatever modern man
finds unsatisfactory in his en-
vironment. This attitude is not
to be confused with the optimis-

tic identification of ‘‘is’’ -and
“ought’”’ found in—say, Alexan-
der Pope or Voltaire’s Dr. Pang-
loss.

Modern man does not feel that
this is the best of all worlds. but
that since it is the only one
we've got we'd better resign our-
selvés to our present understand.
ing of it and not rock the boat
with attempts to improve it. De-
scriptive analysis may not pro-
duce happiness, but it will hold
the pieces together long enough
for us to get through the day.

Today our attempts at social
planning (not social improve-
ment, just ‘‘planning’'), and our
attempts at artistic creation or
to find ultimate truth are all di-
rected to, one goal, namely the
fullest possible description of ex
istence.

INTELLECTUAL SOURCE

What distinguishes Goodman,
in this one book at least. is that

Secor Views Goodman

f by way of apology, but in order to ex-

the book as an exposure

(e.g. ban private cars from New
York City to alleviate some of
the problems of urban conges-

humanity to thousands of small

communities).

Always he sees the problems
and the solutions in entirely hu-

stacles in the utopianism of intel-
lectualized descriptions of life-
problems, While his solutions are
indeed practical they are regard-

utopian. The irony is that the

of human freedom. Neither life ;
as an ‘intellectually (technolog ;
ically) determined problem, nor:
freedom as ‘irrelevant response |

Nor will he accept the hopeless '
idea that freedom can never al

life.

Goodman is great because he|
rejects the modern pessimistic
alternatives: (1) man may en-
dure in the slavery of a techno-

accepted conformity of morals!
and taste: (2) man may with-

What Goodman does is lo set

are wrongly assumed to be the!
inevitable, non-moral conditions
of life. Life, he seems to say. is”
not an intellectualized “prob

Telephones Change
To Pre-Paid Basis

All coin telephones on the
Davidson campus have been
placed on a pre-paid basis as
of March 1.

According 40 J. Harry Mann,
district manager for Southern
Bell in Charlotte. the change
was made so that campus tele-
phones would conform with oth-
er phones all over the coun-
try.

“Due to an equipment short-
age after World War II, we
had to install the ‘post-pay’
telephones in many areas, and
we are standardizing all coin
telephones now.\said Mann.

“In effect the change means
that the caller will have to
deposit his dime before get-
ting the dial tone. This is the
system used in most of the
country now,” he concluded.

Mann added that a new tele-
phone directory will be dis-
tributed beginning today, The
cover will be light blue with
a drawing of the Charlotte Col-
lege Science building.
