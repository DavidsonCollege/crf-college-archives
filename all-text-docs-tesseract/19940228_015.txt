Women's lacrosse
preview

By Will Cobb

After five long weeks of prac-
tice in the fickle North Carolina
weather, the Davidson Women’s
Lacrosse team will head to Will-
iam & Mary University to start the
season. Lead by head coach Kerstin
Manning, the Wildcats will travel
to compete in scrimmages against

schools such *as Georgetown, -

Washington & Lee, and Johns
Hopkins.

Immediately following the
tournament, the Wildcats will have
their first Division I game at home
when they face St. Joseph’s (PA)
on Richardson Field under the
lights at 7:00 p.m. March 7.

“I think we have the potential
to do really well against the com-
petition we are slated with this
season,” said Manning.

The team selected juniors
Allison Adams, Amanda Bryan,
and Liz Schaper as the three cap-
tains. “I am counting on the cap-
tains to lead the team both on and
off the field. I’m confident they
will do a really good job,” said
Manning.

On offense, freshwomen Lisa
Dorson and Rosie Gaynor figure
to start on the frontline along with
sophomore Anne Sutton. In the
midfield, consisting of five posi-
tions, there exist two offensive and
two defensive slots along with the
center.

The attack wing positions
should be filled by freshwoman
Sarah Hogan, currently recover-

ing from mononucleiosis, and
sophomore Hedy Moolenaar. Cap-
tain Amanda Bryan will hold the
center position, while the defen-
sive midfielders will probably be
Lynn Daubenspeck and Rebecca
Maclean. Once captain Liz Schaper
returns from illness, she figures to
Start at a variety of positions as she
is the most versatile player on the
team.

Heading the defensive duties
will be junior captain Allison
Adams, backed by Allison Rhoads
and Amy Cragin. Anchoring the
defense in goal will be sophomore
Jenn Lake in her second year as a
Starter.

Top reserves figure to be Jen
Bean, Michelle Cadawallader,
Ashley Gribble, Kerry Monaghan,
Suzy Spressert, Tanner Thomp-
son, and Marian Woodworth.

Big games for the Wildcats
include matches versus Division I
foe George Mason along with the
highly ranked Division III Roanoke
College. This year’s matches are
important since a successful sea-
son could help get Davidson a more
exclusive Division I schedule.

“T believe we can win as many
games as we have. We just have to
put our minds to it,” said Manning.

The season begins this week-
end in Virginia, and with only four
home games on the schedule,
Monday’s game on the 7th will be
a rare opportunity for students to
watch the lacrosse program reach
the next level.

Wrestling splits three-way meet

By Will Cobb

Last weekend, the wrestling
team finished their regular season
with dual match against Campbell
and Longwood. Now the Cats look
to prepare for the conference tour-
nament held this weekend in
Asheville.

In the first match, Davidson
completed a season sweep of
Longwood in a 39-16 rout. Before
this season, Davidson had not de-
feated Longwood in eight years.
The Wildcats were led by Miles
Miller, Sam Knowles, and Osric
Prioleau, who all pinned their op-
ponent.

“They had forfeits, but we
would have beaten them anyway,”
said head coach Tom Oddo.

The second match involved
Campbell University, one of
Davidson’s tougher Division I op-
ponents, where the Cats stood
strong, falling 30-18. Freshman
Aaron Kenner got Davidson on the
scoreboard when he pitined his
opponent with 1:24 left in the sec-
ond period.

Another freshman, Miller, got
his second pin of the day with only
0.6 seconds remaining in an in-
tense, hard-fought match. Junior
Jared Glick rounded out the

Davidson scoring when he pinned
his opponent in a really physical
contest.
“These were perfect matches
this weekend to prepare us for the
conference tournament, where we
have a couple of guys that can do
really well,” said Oddo
Miller is now 27-13 on the
season while Kenner has upped his
record to 11-6. Knowles now has a
record of 24-12, including 13 pins
which leads the Southern Confer-
ence. Hopefully, these guys along
with the others can make a state-
ment for Davidson’s growing wres-
tling program this weekend.

Baseball stands 2-5

By Rick Thurmond

The Wildcats once again dis-
played their impressive power in a
doubleheader at VMI. Unfortu-
nately, they bunched all their runs
in the second game.

The result was a split. Chris
Carrigan started and pitched yell
in the opener. However, untimely
Davidson errors led to unearned
runs and a 4-0 loss.

In the second game, the Wild-
cats exploded. Michael New hit an
early home run, his second of the
year, then Chad Blackwelder
cracked a grand slam in the sev-
enth inning. Blackwelder’s shot
put the ‘Cats ahead to stay. Brian
Heil got the win in relief.

UNC-Greensboro toppled the
Wildcats 4-3 Friday in a makeup
of Wednesday’s rainout. Mac
Chapman smacked two homeruns,
his second and third, in the loss.

The Wildcats record now
stands at 2-5. Chapman’s three
home runs leads the team.

such a success,” said Slagle.

Davidson will still host the
event this December.

“We are going to present the
best [Final Four] ever in *94, set-
ting the standard as high as we
can,” said Slagle.

Because Davidson has done
such an outstanding job, Richmond
has their work cut out for them. For
the sport of soccer, let’s hope they
can carry out what they have prom-
ised.
