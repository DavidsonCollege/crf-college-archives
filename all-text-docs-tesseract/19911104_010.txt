THE DAVIDSONIAN CAMPUS LIVING MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1991

sive. If people start selecting and
excluding, a portion of the student
body is eliminated.

Also, in a school this size,
you’re sure to know, or at least
recognize, someone everywhere
you gooncampus. This familiarity
adds to the genuinely fun atmos-
phere of Davidson social life.

At a Saturday night fraternity
party, a girl visiting from Furman
commented that social life here
seemed “really open and that no
one seemed to be afraid to be
himself [herself].” Her statement
may be a bit idealistic about life
here, but one is more comfortable
having fun and being oneself when
the environment and the people in
it are familiar.

And of course it goes without
saying that Davidson students are
the de-stressing experts.

Sure, there are the super-gifted
students here who aren’t having
many problems atall and may even
be considering transferring to a
harder school (a scary thought),
but the majority of students here
are struggling right along side of
me. Okay, maybe everyone hasn’t
heard and doesn’t care about
Davidson, and so whatif my friends
are playing harder than they are
working; I think I’ll stay here for
now. My grandfather worked hard
and has become a very successful,
happy , and down-to-earth person
that I am proud of.

In respect to my dear friends,
if 1 succeed in graduating from
Davidson, 1 will probably be
making twice as much as they will
and will enjoy my work more than
they will. Some short term advan-
tages are that this college has al-
most no hicks (NOT to be con-
fused with southerners) and is
‘culturally diverse’ (my roommate
is from London).

Furthermore, social life here
is far from non-existent. So, if I
have caused some of you to ques-
tion the basics and meanings of
life, which would be quite a feat,

dispensers take care of all our
worries and make breakfast just a
little easier for all of us.

5) Similarly, we are fortunate
that Davidson saw fit to provide us
with a juke-box in the Union. Stu-
dents can now listen to Barry
Manilow at any time of the day.
This is so considerate; I missed my
stereo whenever! entered the cafe.
This really useful machine has

already proven to bea great source
of comfort for me.

6) It seems that 1991 has really
been a year for useful material
benefits, things which we can all
appreciate. The re-carpeting of the
guest-house is just one example. I
find it reassuring that visitors to
the college can enjoy the benefits
of home. One must admit the last
carpet was really a little bit vulgar,
and Davidson can not afford this
social faux pas.

7) One must not forget that the
majority of the tuition fees are

tion of the students. The library
currently subscribes to three dif-
ferent papers from Great Britain.
Thisis very useful, especially since
one of these papers is The Daily
Telegraph. Itis reassuring that the
college supports the British news-
paper industry. No one in Britain
reads the Telegraph, so itis kindof
Davidson to keep this really infor-
mative and unbiased newspaper in
print.

8) Really useful additions to
the library this year include the
new CHAL booths. I am relieved
that Davidson has finally recog-
nized the need for secrecy when
checking upon the availability of
books in the library. I always find
spying a great problem; now I can
check CHAL in the privacy of my
own booth,

9) Davidson also sees fit to
educate students on world affairs.

The printing of the Geographical
Awareness quiz, taken by Fresh-
men, was well worth the money
and time that it cost. Although we
are still waiting for the results, itis
reassuring to realize that we know
so little. The money spent by the
college in making sure I was aware
of my ignorance was very well
spent.

10) The most useful thing that
Davidson has spent money on this
year, however, is without a doubt,
the Security Handbook. This bright
yellow book provided me with a
lot of new,useful knowledge. Iam
now aware that it is dangerous to
walk alone through the center of
Charlotte at 3:00am. I also realize
that it is foolish not to lock my
bicycle if I leave it outside the
dorm. Well, I never! Thank-you
Davidson - that really was money
well-spent.
