born great, some achieve great-|.

ness, and some have greatness
thrust upon them.” We happen to
be one of those who believe Lin-
coln had the inherent character-
istics of greatness and would have
achieved it despite the “War Be-
tween the States;” :aany others
also feel that this historical event
was not responsible for thrusting
greatness on him, for our country
always needs men of such char-
acter at any time and would prob-
ably be in a better position today
if more of our leaders and citi-
zens had “the spirit of Lincoln”
where he walks by day or night!

To those students who are proud
of their forefathers, not to the ex-
tent of worship but of just ven-
eration and respect, and who take
their Christianity seriously, it was
heartening to learn that many of
the sentiments expressed in the
speech were not original with Dr.
Johnston as he vaguely intimated
at the outset of his address.

Indeed, Dr. Johnston is so bril-

liant an historian and exceptional
lecturer that one is prone to for-
give such a speech as that of last
Tuesday; -it is hoped that he will
realize just how what he said af-
fected some of his listeners, even
if it afforded amusement to the
majority, and think carefully be-
fore delivering it again in another
three years for around the fifth
time. It is also hoped that he will
share with the students his mag-
nificent ability as an informative
and entertaining speaker again in
the near future with an original
subject more worthy of his splen-
did talents.

elated fans reached out over the campus, the stands began to
fill until at the game’s end a nearly packed house was on
hand. As the final buzzer brought one final roar of approval
from the crowd the floor was thronged as congratulations
and approvals were stacked upon players and coach.

Very reminicent of the early season victory over Fur-
man last year, we feel it is an indication of brighter things to
come this season. You will remember that the Furman win
last year was about the only bright star in Davidson’s cage
heaven, but last Tuesday the endurance five of Graeme Keith,
Hobby Cobb, Ish Bennett, Ray Harding and Buddy “Goose”
Brown played steady, level-headed basketball which can be
reproduced in the future, rather than a one-night ‘“‘over-their-
heads” phenomenon.

Tomorrow night the Cats make their Southern confer-
ence debut against VPI on the local boards. The Gobbiers
have one of their stronger teams in recent years and another
exciting contest seems in the making. Fan support has a lot
to do with basketball victories—Johnston Gym should be
packed for tomorrow’s encounter. BEAT VPI!
