Goals For Second Semester:
Our Platform

Policy changes with a change in administration are inevitable. Edi-
torials for the second semester of 1959-60 will be based on the following

1. An enrichment of the academic program at Davidson.

A. In order to make the educational effort a continuous process through-
out four years instead of a spasmodic movement between examination
periods, the DAVIDSONIAN favors a system of comprehensive exam-
inations for seniors in their major fields of study. These examinations
would be oral, and seniors would prepare for them by presenting a
senior paper in their major subject.

B. An independent reading program should be instituted. The program
at Dartmouth and Mary Baldwin point the way for a well rounded

2. An examination of moral and ethical issues on the campus.

The DAVIDSONIAN will call for a reconsideration of the resolution
passed by the Board of Trustees concerning the maintenance of
racial segregation at Davidson. If the Trustees were guided by
Christian and moral considerations, no indication of this appeared
in their brief statement of last year. Questions are being asked and

more meaningful intellectual atmosphere outside the classroom.

A. The Great Issues series should be revised and expanded. The series
can be vastly improved by developing it along the lines of the Yale
Challenge Program. Nationally known speakers and pertinent topics
are indispensable for a really successful program.

B. The A;tist Series is an undeveloped gold mine. The staff is available
for planning, and does a good job with the funds it has available. A
larger budget would greatly increase the value of the Series.

more constructive role for fraternities in the life of the college.

Last year’s Greek Week, improved as it was, remained destructive in
spirit. Future improvement and better supervision are necessary.
Fraternities should participate in community service projects during
the year. Fraternity goals should be coincident with the aims of the
college rather than merely parallel as they are now.

5. A more sensible relationship between the athletic and the academic

A complete re-evaluation of the athletic. subsidization program will
be made, and its place on the campus of a liberal arts institution

A Chance - -- For Another Chance

In chapel this morning, Dee Green,
speaking for the student council, pro-
posed a modification of the penalty
for violation of the honor code. The
gist of this proposal is that some stu-
dents dismissed for an honor violation
would be allowed to return to school
after a certain length of time had
elapsed.

This proposal already has faculty
approval. At a meeting prior to to-
day’s presentation in chapel, the
faculty voted to favor such a change.

The new program’s fate is now in
the hands of the students. The DAV-
IDSONIAN believes that this pio
gram merits serious consideration by
the students. We favor its adoption.

Davidson is an institution founded
on Christian’ principles. Forgiveness
is a Christian principle. Dismissal
without any chance of reprieve does
not measure up to the standards
which are the foundation of our col-
lege.

A student returning to Davidson
after being expelled for cribbing
would need one thing—a lot of guts.

Some of his acquaintances would be
gone, but many would still be in
school. And they would remember.
The professors would remember, too.
It wouldn’t be easy to come back. It
would take guts. We feel that a man
who accepted the challenge and re-

_turned to what perhaps would be an

hostile campus would be an asset to
Davidson.

We recommend that the period
of dismissal for those allowed to
return be set at a minimum of
two years. Two years is a long time
in the life of a young man—but not
too long. It is a period that could
be put to other uses—substantial vo-
cational training or the getting off
of one’s service requirement. Above
all it would be a period in which to
think, to decide whether or not to
return to school.

The proposal will .be voted on
next Friday. We hope in this time
every student will have ‘given it long
thoughts. We believe that if it is so
considered, the student body will
vote for its adoption —J. H.

Placement .Service: Good For All

One of the programs on campus
that has the most potential and is
most ignored is the Placement Ser-
vice, operated by the College Union.
Aside from the obvious benefits a
graduating senior derives from the
program, it offers to all freshmen,
sophomores, and juniors a chance to
begin thinking about a career after
graduation.

A comment we often hear from a
senior is “I don’t know what I want
to do. I haven’t thought or talked
much about it.” This year the Place-

ment Service has scheduled open in-
terviews to meet this dilemma. Each
interviewing company has set aside a
half hour at four o’clock of the after-
noon it is on campus to talk to all
interested students. These sessions
will be informal, and will involve no
obligation. They are intended to give
underclassmen a chance to start
thinking about the problem, and to
talk to company representatives.
Each week’s schedule will be pub-

lished in the DAVIDSONIAN. We .

urge ali students to take advantage
of this opportunity.

Ys

Last spring this column de-
bated the chances of the major
Presidential hopefuls. There
were few issues at stake at that
time. By now, as might be ex-
pected, several issues have come
up, and the politicians in Wash-
ington are very busy trying to
manufacture some more.

NO “SMILING IKE”.

Issues,. both real and other-
wise, will probably mean more
in November than they have in
the past eight years. Neither
party has a “Smiling Ike” Eisen-
hower to put up.

‘The Republicans will un-
doubtedly point to their glori-
ous record of peace and pros-
perity. Richard Nixon is trying
to create the image of the good
little boy who will continuc
Daddy Ike's policies, whatever
that may be, so that all will be
fine and dandy.

ALL NOT WELL

TOIL AND TROUBLE

Stone Views ‘60 Hopefuls

By JOHN STONE

While ‘recdgnizing the trend to-
ward moderate conservatism in
Amcrican politics, the Demo-
crats recognize that all is not
well with the world just because
Ike says it is.

Regardless of the candidate,

‘the Democrats will emphasize

civil rights, missile armanients,
two-faced Republican foreign
policy, and the fact that despite
all the big talk, the Republicans
have ‘not quite managed to col-
lect as much taxes as they have
spent in the last few years.

“KENNEDY TOPS

John F. Kennedy is the fore-
most Democrat at present, ac-
cording to the polls. If he is
nominated, his Roman Catho-
licism will almost surely be
something of an issue.

loudly as it was in Al Smith’s

cator of whether—or how much

ADLA! AGAIN?

There are a lot of people who
would love to see Adlai Steven-

tion is whether a two-time loser

I think only Stevenson’s nomi-
nation could answer that, and 1
certainly think he has more
intelligence, more ability than
most others, including former
opponents.

Lyndon Johnson is also in-
terested in removing a preju-
dice—the one against South-
erners. More power to him.

As far as I can tell, Syming-
ton and.Humobhrey are running
on the general liberal Demo-
cratic ticket. I don’t have any
objections to this, except I
don’t think those policies can
win in '60, and the Democrats
need a winner.

Bob Jones, '58

Dear Editor:

It seems highly unfortunate
to me that the letter of Rev.
Hall (Jan. 8, 1960) was not taken
with considerably more soul-

searching than appears evident -

in your editorial response.

Being one who usually
views the Board of Trustees
with a degree of suspicion |
feel encouraged: by the fact
one of its members is con.
cerned enough with student
affairs to record some of his
Opinions.

And while substantive points
were sacrificed for literary
technique, the letter expressed
a point of view with which many
of your alumni readers would
heartily agree.

The editorial page of that
particular issue itself provid-
ed sufficient judgment on the
editorial policy to substanti-
ate Rev. Hall’s remarks and
to inspire a thoroughgoing
self-examination.

In the first place the ill-con- :

ceived attack on the AAUP’s
stand on. academic freedom,
which has been affirmed not
only by the Davidson chapter
(as Professor Marrotte’s letter
clearly stated) but by the lead-
ing colleges and universities of
the country and acknowledged
by a_certain ex-president of
Columbia, represent a wild and
irresponsible attack which aptly
illustrates Rev. Hall's comment
on being “stuffy” and even
more clearly illustrates a mis-
understanding of what the
AAUP actually affirmed and
the issues involved.

Secondly, in your response
to Rev. Hall you listed the
“erusading” points of the ed-
itorial policy. The only one
of a really specific nature
has been the matter of cuts.
( attended Davidson under
the current cut system and
feel there is sufficient room
for improvement to merit an
editorial on the subject, pos-
sibly two.

But making such a trifling
matter the primary cause for
which the paper stands (as your
own statement seems clearly to
indicate) is, frankly, the height
of absurdity, a crusade of
triviality.

My purpose, however, is
not to rile over in criticism,
but § must admit (as a faith-
ful reader of your columns)
} have been disappointed in
the nerrowness of outlook

HIM THE DIRT AND DUST OF

and often ill-grounded judg
ments displeyed by your edi-
torlals. The Davidsonian is
not the place for the editor's
pet peeves.

As one concerned with David-
son I would carnestly request
that Rev. Hall's point of view
be-taken with considerably more
seriousness and respect.

G. L. Gladstone

Dear Editor:

It has been said that David-
son is a unique college. I agree.
Davidson is one of the few
places where large student at-
tendance at church is a problem.

The powers that be have
recently made a proclamation
of an extra vespers cut for
each class this semester. This
is, in effect, a request that
each class not attend church
on a specific Sunday.

Now there is only one thing
that makes me madder than be-
ing told that I have to go to
church; and that is being told
that it would be preferred that
I not go to church.

Students, rise up and de-
fend your rights! Attend ves-
pers and fet nothing prevent
us from having e@ full church
every Sunday.

THE HAWK'S NEST

Old Tale: Freddie Flubs,
Reforms—And Falls Again

By JACK TAYLOR

Forlorn, his spirit burdened with the anquish of a
failure, Freddie slumped into the dusky room and fell
despondently across the unkempt bed. His pale fingers
clutched a scrap of crumpled paper.

He lay silent for a long time, breathing thought-
fully. Finally he propped himself up on one elbow
and began ironing out the wrinkled wad on the bed

spread.

Sadly his eyes stared at the grey column of figures.
The D’s were still there, black, stark, and unpitying.
Freddie slumped back onto the cold sheets, despair
burning his eyes, his spirit vanquished; for a long
moment he seemed dead.

But the human spirit possesses remarkable regen-
erative powers; with time as its only medicine it will
soon replenish itself fully. Freddie's spirit had a par-
ticularly wondrous capacity for restoration.

Along with the resurging spirit, new thoughts began
seeping into Freddie's destitute mind, gradually gaining
momentum until they pounded through his brain with
the force of surging waters.

“Two D's... 1 know I ain’t dumb... heck, |
made B’s in high school . . . look at Mike—he makes
B’s, and he isn’t any smarter than me. . . What's the
difference? . . . Well, that isn’t hard—he studies.
That’s the whole deal; he studies and | goof off. If |
studied like he does, I’d make the grades he does.

“And, by God, that’s what I’m going to do. I’m going
to study, and show everybody I’m not as dumb as they
think. No more goofing off for me; no t.v., no flicks, no
nothing but study, study, study. Work, work, work; that’s
the ticket.”

His fagging energies renewed, Freddie leapt from
the bed, eagerly bent on beginning the crusade against
his old self. “And the place to begin work is with the
rats’ nest,” he shouted above the din of his pounding
thoughts.

Frantically, exuberantly, he began flinging clothes
in one corner, books in another, old papers and cig:
arette butts in a third.

The door swung open, revealing a startled Jack
Olenheim. Jack was Freddie’s roommate; the sight of
honest work always startled him. “What the (censored)
are you doing?” he inquired cautiously.

“Before you stands the vision of life renewed,” an-
nounced Freddie grandly. “This day, this hour, marks
the beginning of a new way of life for me.

“My motte: A clean mind in a clean body. My
avowed purpose: to fulfill my divine destiny as a man
of letters, a scholar in the truest sense of the word.”

“Mein Gott! you’re mad,” exclaimed Jack, relieved
that nothing serious had happened. ‘Must I spend my
days with a raving idiot? Nursemaid to a maniac—is
that my destiny? Come on. Paul and Ted want to play
some gin. They’re already down at the house.”

“Nope, can‘t do. it. Got to start out right. Away with
you, vile temptor! Away I say!” Freddie stretched his
arm dramatically toward the door.

“Ah, come on,” Jack demanded, grabbing the out-
flung arm. “We can take those guys to the cleaners.
Remember last time?”

Freddie pulled back, hesitating between old desire
and new ambition. “Just one short game,” Jack pleaded.
“Thirty minutes. You’ve got all day and tomorrow to
pursue saving grace.”

Freddie stopped at the door, still resisting feebly.
“You swear no more than one game?” Jack nodded
affirmatively. “All right, but absolutely none beyond
one. I’m not going to goof off this semester like I did
ast.” -

Figures On Funds Show
Athletes Get Most Aid

Are athletes worth more than $1050 and average major ace
scholars? demic grants at $397.

Basketball grants average
$640 against an average stipend
of $400 for “minor” academic
scholarship winners.

No one at Davidson readily
answers “yes,” but a study of
average financial grants
shows that Davidson's basket-
ball and football players re-
ceive larger average grants

etic prowess alone. The only

A study of scholarship statis-

PASSING BEFORE
"MY EYES!

“We figure it’s our mistake
if we don't judge a boy’s ability
accurately,” Athletic Director
Scott stated Wednesday.

But the athletic department
can afford such expensive
mistakes; the scholarship
treasury for football grants in
1959 stood at $49,550; for
major academic grants, $33,
780.

Why the imbalance?

It's a matter of necessity.
Athletic competition is an ex-
pensive proposition, while aca-
demic competition, apparently,
is not so intense.

All the while, gentle contro-
versy rages between proponents
of money-for-brawn and money-
for-brain.

And all agree on one point:
the situation is far from “ideal.”
