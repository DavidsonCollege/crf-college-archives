Speaking of Sports

The Wildcats won two more games
last week. This makes four collegiate
games won and two lost. Their per-
centage thus far is .666.

——Wildcate—

The team started yesterday on its first
North Carolina trip. They take them
on in the following order:

February 16—Elon at Elon.

February 17—-N. C. State at Raleigh.

February 18—University of N. C. at
Chapel Hill. ‘

— Wildcate—

Davidson has scored 293 points to
their opponents 266. This shows that
“Coach Hengeveld’s scoring machine is
getting limbered up and will be in prime
condition for all the frays this week.

—-Wildcats——

Elon played a fine, clean, hard-fought
game. We complimented them on their
sportsmanship. Florida played hard and
roughly, and the cleaness of the game
was marred several times by players of
both teams.

—Wildcate—

The other teams in the state met with
varying luck during the past week. Guil-
ford split even, winning from N. C. State
and losing to Wake Forest. Wake For-
est also won from N. C. State, exactly
doubling their opponents score.

Trinity played only one game, taking
the Uni. of Florida into camp by a score
of 49 to 22.

—Wildcate——

Trinity invaded Virginia this week,
taking on the University, V. M. L, and
W. and L. She has been resting up
lately getting in shape for this little
jaunt. :

—Wildcatse—

The University has been easing up a
bit since their long northern trip. They
will play the Wildcats at Chapel Hill
Friday night. The winner of that game
will have a good claim for the state
championship. .

TRACK CANDIDATES HARD
AT WORK-—PROSPECTS
GOOD FOR STRONG TEAM

For the past week the candidates for
the track team have been unable to
practice because of continued rains.
However, on Friday and Saturday after-
noons the track men were able to prac-
tice in front of Chambers. Coach Grey
coached the men in weight events,
hurdles, and dashes.

The athletic field has been in such a
condition as to make practice on it im-
possible. For this reason the pote vault
and jumping practice has been tempor-
arily deferred. The field is being work-
ed on and it is hoped that the practices
can be carried on there this week.

Leonard Dick, captain and manager of
the team, says that some excellent mate-
rial has been found among the aspirants
coming from the Fresh class, and that
prospects are good.

The schedule for the team is as fol-
lows:

April 8, N. C. State, at Raleigh.

April 16, U. of S. C, at Davidson.

April 23, Clemson, at Clemson.

May 7, State meet, at Chapel Hill. .

The date for the field day has not yet
been decided.

WRESTLERS BEGIN PRAC-
. TICE—CONTRACTS SIGNED
wy FOR TWO MATCHES

The basement of the gym has seen a
lively time during the past week. About
thirty “mighty men of the mat” re-
sponded to the call of “Jap” Cummings
and are being rounded into shape under
the coaching of “Jap” and “Bill” Roberts.
Practice begins at four o'clock every
afternoon.
Contracts have been signed for
matches with Washington and Lee for
March 12 and V..M. I. for March 13;
both to be held at Lexington, Va. There
is probability of return matches for both
of these and also a match at Chapel
Hill, All of these will be hard contest;
but with the coaches as a nucleus we
‘should be able to build up a team that
| will give them more than they are look-
ing for. A tournament will be held dur-
‘ing the first week in March in order to

Ipiclk a team.

Saturday night Coach Hengevelt will
put on exhibition for the first time this
year his specially trained Wildkittens.
Although still young and unfamiliar
with the ways of this cruel world,
“Dutch” feels that with the tricks learn-
ed in two months against the “old cats,”
the kittens will make someone sit up
and take notice.

The basketball tossers from Winston-
Salem Hi will play the part of the ball
of twine for the kittens to roll around
the gym floor. Tlie twin city lads have
been running wild this season and be-
lieve that they will be able to twist the
kitten’s tail. But the kittens have had
their tail twisted before by the “Papa
cats,” and they know that it isn’t a
pleasant sensation. So woe be it unto
the foolish youth who tries to lift the
kittens off the floor by the wrong end.

The right claw of the “pussy” is the
more experienced and it will be the one
that first swings at the visitors from the
tobacco city. All good kitten’s paws
have five claws and the Wildkitten is no
exception. Each claw is well sharpened
and is sure to make itself felt-on Satur-
day.

McConnell at left forward will be the
“thumb claw” on the pussy's paw. Much
is expected of the “thumb claw” and
“Claw Jim” is sure to fill the bill. Mc-
Donald will be Jim's running mate at
right forward, and “Claw Sam” will tear
‘many threads from the ball. Of course
the longest claw is in the middle and
Mauze holds down this job. If the
game last year the “Mose Claw” got
broken but it is back in form now and
will tear some big strips out of Prince
Albert's Coat.

The last two claws are short, but OH!
How sharpt! The guards will be King
and DeArmond. “King Claw,” and “Doc

Claw” are new in the paw; they have.

not realized their full growth but they
are sharp and strong. With them at the
guard position the “Camel” and “Brown's
Mule” are not likely to go back “wagging
their tails behind them.”

The left paw will be ready to take a
swing if the right one can’t turn the
trick. Claws Hunter, Toney, Brake, and
McPherson are raring to tear off a chew
of Brown’s Mule that will last for some
days to come.

WILD CAT GLEE CLUB
MAKES MERRY AT QUEENS

Monday night before a good house at
Queens the Glee Club gave a rousing
concert, the first of their week's tour
through this State. From the first
strains of “College Ties” to the last
words of “O! Davidson,” every minute
was filled with good old Davidson mel-
ody.

The features of the whole program
were the selections by the whole chorus
and by the string sextette. Frank Law
and Fred Thompson were brought back
many times, and the “Jazz Orchestra”
brought due applause after each num-
ber. The colfege quartet, though crip-
pled by the absence of Moore and Shep-
herd, performed well. Too much credit
cannot be given Francis Northop, whose
work at the piano would do credit to any
college.

Taking it all in all, a very good concert
was given, but great improvement is ex-
pected with each succeeding concert.
Watch for news from Winston, where
the boys break the Salem hearts Tues-
day night. Then Lexington, Asheville,
and Hendersonvills are to be made in
succession.

The personel of the club follows:

First Tenors: C. H. Vance, W. H.
Robinson, C. H. Long, and H. Meyers.

Second Tenors: F. N. Thompson, J. H.
McKeithen, C. J. Matthews, W. B. Carr,
Robt. McLeod, J. M. Adams.

First Bass: O. J. Allison, J. W. Phillips,
F. Law, R. J. Rudge.

Second Bass: J. D. Barnhardt, D. P.
MoGeachy, A. V. Gibson, Frank North-
rop, pianist.

Immediately after the concert, the
Queens girls gave the club a very en-
joyable reception. Delicious cream was
served which it is needless to say was
thoroughly enjoyed. Here's to you

lina being played at Chapel Hill. The
University lads have an exceptionally
good team this year and have a, long
string of scalps on their belts, that of ;
Durham “Y” being among them. Thus
far Trinity has been the only State team
that has taken their measure, and she
turned the trick by the small margin of
one field goal. Carolina has just return-
ed from a long Northern trip on which
they won four out of nine games. The
Southern lads were leading until the
last, moments of play in the games lost,
but couldn’t stand the pressure of fresh
substitutes against them.

It is easy to see that the Red and
Black ball tossers stack up against some
real teams on this trip. If they are suc-
cessful in alf three games the State
championship will be their for the ask-
