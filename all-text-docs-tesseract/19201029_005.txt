MONDAY NIGHT

St. Claire Sisters to Present Musi-| i!

cal Numbers and Readings.

After strenuous effort on the part of] '

the managers, C. H. Long and E. A.
Nash, the Redpath Company was in-
duced to send as the second number of
the season, the St. Claire Sisters.

They will appear on Monday night.
November: 1, at 8 o’clock, in Shearer
Hall.

Although the numbers last year were
a great success, the managers this year
were a little more costly in their tastes
and the very best that goes on the
Redpath circuit will be shown here. The
additional number of students in the
student body is expected to help defray
the added expense of better entertain-
ments,

Ralph Bingham, as good or better
than most of last season's, has recom-
mended very highly the St. Claire Sis-
ters. A man of his character and abil-
ity should be amply qualified to judge
the merits of a number.

Each one of the four sisters is beauti-
ful and talented both in the art of play-
ing musical instruments and in singing.
Their favorite instrument is the violin,
but they are also right there when it
comes to playing cither a mandolin.
banjo or piano.

Among the many features of the pro-
gram is the banjo quartet which has
been pronounced by those who have
heard it to be one of the first order.
Some of the other features are: quartet
numbers, violin solos and ducts, orches-
tral music of violins, mandolins and
piano, and pianologues. There are also
some humorous songs with plenty of

pep and action, and the banjo orchestra

of a violin, two banjos and a piano is
said to be especially effective with popu-
lar music.

The whole number is exceptionally
good and of the very highest order and
ought to attract a record breaking crowd
both of students and townspeople.

The following is an extract froma let-
ter received by Fresh Minter:
“You dear cute thing:

every time | think of thee my heart
goes up and down like an old-time churn
dasher, and a glorious sensation of tn-
utterable joy capers over my heart like
young goats over a stable roof. The
thrill is like Spanish needles jagging me
thru a thin garment. So low am EF in
the sea of glory when I hear from you,
my brain whirls around like a bumble-
bee under a glass tumbler, my tongue re-
fuses to wag, and, in silent but blissful
adoration, | drink in the unlimited affec-
tions of your bountiful love, as a thirsty
man in days gone by drank a glass of!
good corn or rye whiskey. [ think of
you from the crowing of the cocks until ,
the putting to bed of the bull. ‘

“Write to me soon, and remember in:
the mud-puddle of your affection to keep:
one little tadpole wiggling for me. ;

“Yours in dark corners,
“Snooks.”
