Field Events

About an even dozen of North Carolina’s
leading high school track teams will as-
semble here this week-end for the anfual
Davidson invitation meet to be held én Sat-
urday afternoon beginning at 2 o'clock. Not
all of the entries have been mailed in yet
that are expected, but by Saturday it is ex-
pected that the entry list will grow to about
a dozen. Those that are in at present include:
Oxford Orphanage High School, R. J. Rey-
nolds High School, Winston-Salem; High
Point High School, New Hanover High
School, Wilmington; Concord High School,
Belmont Abbey High School, Westfield High
School. Charlotte High School will also send
a team up, it is reported.

Not much is known about the relative
strength of the state teams, but Charlotte
High, High Point, Winston-Salem and Wil-
mington are expected to furnish most of the
competition unless some dark-horse group
rises up. It is not known whether there are
any Goodwins or Mullis’s to lead the way
this year or not, but there is a certainty that

some new individual stars will show this

year.

As has been the custom in the past, David-
son’s Frosh team will also compete, but their
points will not count. They will only run
in the preliminary heats of the shorter dis-
tances. Last week Charlotte High outclassed
the Freshmen in a triangular meet with the
varsity, which makes it look like this meet
will be pretty fast.

The order of events will be as follows:

2 :00—120 high hurdles—trials.

2:15—100 yd. dash—trials.

2 :30—Mile.

2:45—100 yd. dash—finals.

3:00—120 yd. high hurdles—finals.

3:15—220 yd. dash—trials.

3 :30—880 yd. run.

3:45—220 yd. low hurdles—trials,

4 :00—440 yd. run.

4:15—220 yd. dash—finals.

4 :30—220 yd. low hurdles—finals.

Field events:

2:00—High jump and shotput.

2:45—Pole vault and discus throw.

3 :30—Broad jump and javelin throw.

Wildcat Cindermen
Take Opening Meet

Davidson’s Wildcat track team ran up a
total of 11414 points to overwhelm the Char-
lotte High School and the Davidson Fresh-
men cinder artists in their first meet of the
season last Saturday afternoon’ Charlotte
High was second with 25 points, while the
Wildkittens trailed with 12 1-3 points.

Joe McCall, varsity track captain, and
Graham George, also of the varsity, tied for
first honors for the afternoon, each scoring

14 points. McCall compiled his total by tak-
ing first place in the broad jump and the
javelin throw and tying for first in the 100-
yard dash, while George’s total came as a
result of first places in both hurdle events
and third place in both the broad and high
jumps. i

All, except two first places were copped
by the varsity. Charlotte won one of these
when Sutton threw the shotput over 42 feet.
The other went to the Freshmen when Haly-
burton nosed out Neal, of the varsity, to cop
the 350-yard dash,

The times on all the events were rather
slow, and the middle distances were short-
ened to prevent over-exertion on the part of
the contestants.

McCallie, varsity; Little, varsity; Stalhart,
Charlotte. Time, 16 seconds.

SHADOWS OF COMING EVENTS

Saturday, March 21
Track meet: State Interscholastic High
School track meet.

Davidson is this week host to some of
the best high school athletes which the
state of North Carolina has to offer. Each
year the school boy event which the ath-
letic department of the college/ sportgors

schools with each. passin® year and it has
been more and more difficult for Char-
lotte to repeat its annual victory. Last
year it was necessary that they win the!
final event to cop the cup again.

But after seeing them in action last
week, we believe that they will stand a
fair chance of repeating. They seemed to
have the man power and their entries
seemed to have been well coached. They
will certainly present one of the best bal-
anced teams entered, whether or not they
have the cream of the talent. Raleigh,
Greensboro, Wilmington and a number
of other high schools throughout the state
have in times past sent brilliant athletes
to Davidson’s track carnival; they should
do the same this year. The meet should be
well attended.

Varsity baseball practice is beginning to
assume the snap and verve of mid-sea-
son workouts. It was pretty to watch the
infield at work the other afternoon, even
though there were still a number of
rough spots, constant bobbles in the
handling of the ball, and some of that
confidence and snap that one associates
with a smoothly functioning infield ¢om-
bination.

It s rather early to hazard guesses as to |

Shotput—Harold Sutton, Charlotte; Knox,
varsity; Wagner, varsity; Howard Sutton,
Charlotte. Distance 42 feet.

High jump—Wilson, varsity; Allen, var-
sity; George, varsity; Rhyne, Fresh; Cohle,
varsity, and Barksdale, Charlotte» tied for
fourth. Height 5 feet 8 inches.

Javelin throw—McCall, varsity; Brock,
varsity; Howard Sutton, Charlotte; Haroid
Sutton, Charlotte. Distance 162 feet 9 inches.

tional world and a tidy world, but it is not

eld will present much less experience
and ability than the right half.

Outfields will likely be aMthis, Brad-
sher, Covington. However, Doc
Mathis is looked upon as one of the pitch-
ing and Covington also
working out as catcher, so other men may
at times play in the places of these two.
Pradsher, although only a sophomore, has
shown up well as a fielder, and will prob-
ably start at Whiz Miller's place in cen-
ter field. Incidentally, the fly catchers are
apt to get plenty of work this season.

and

possibilities is

The pitchers present a real problem.
Not one has had any real experience and
none has shown exceptional ability.
Thompson, Pearce, and Mathis are the
best bets at present. Goodson may try his
hand at pitching too, but we can’t quite
see the advisability of moving a fine
second baseman to the pitcher’s box un-
less forced to by dire necessity. But that
may be what will face Davidson’s coach
before the season is out. If two good
pitchers can be found, we see no reason
why the club this spring should not be as
good or better than that of last year. _

The track men got their first chance to
show off last Saturday and neatly ran off
with their meet. The varsity team, we
mean. The shortened distances cut down
some of the thrills of a bigger meet, but
nevertheless the rather large crowd seem-
ed well pleased by the turn of events.
Joe McCall and Grimy George looked very
good in personally handing in 14 paints
cach to tie for high point honors. George
competed and placed in four events, get-
ting two first places. McCall won two of
lis entries, and tied for first in the third.
Soup Brannon’s form and runnng on his
mile and a half run jaunt looked even
better than last year. If ever anyone de-
he is the man. He has
trained all winter for his most grueling
ten minutes of runnng in each meet.
