THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 28, 1920.

WHO’S WHO ON THIS YEAR’S WILDCAT NINE

F. W. Hengeveld
Coach

Dt+*

The Davidson Student Body was
indeed joyful when it became known
—that “Dutch,” former star twirler,
would coach baseball. Being a re-
cent alumnus and exercising the
ideals for which it stands, “Dutch”
put out a scrapping team this year.
With that everlasting drive mixed
in with his pleasing personality,
“Coach” turned out a team that
would fight for him to the last
ditch. It is with keen anticipation
that we look for him back next year
when basketball and baseball sea-
sons roll around.
Augustus London Foscue
Manager

D

“Fos” planned a dandy schedule for
the team this year. The leading col-
leges and universities in the South
were met. One feature about the
schedule was the fact that more
games were played on the Hill. This
always increases the interest and
backing of the student body. The
N. C. trip of six days and the Geor-
gia trip of five days, gave the team
a Pleasant reward for their services
rendered the college. Foscue leaves
our midst this year and here’s wish-
ing him success.

“Jonnie” hails from the prosper-
ing town of Liberty Hill, S.C. He
has romped around in the outer gar-
dens successfully for the past three
years, reflecting much credit on him-
self and the Wildcat teams. His
fielding averages this year were per-
fect, the lad from the Palmetto state
accepting 20 chances without a
blunder. He began the season hit-
ting like a demon, but fell in a bad
slump on the Southern trip, never-
theless his terrific wallops have
broken up not a few games. It is
with much regret that we lose “Jon-
nie” and here’s wishing him the suc-
cess that he has attained as a Red
and Black diamond artist.

Edward Erwin Ratchford
Second Base
D**

“E. E.” has covered the midway
sack on Wildcat nines for the past
three years. After his failure to re-
turn in the Fall, much gossip was
heard in the Red and Black baseball
circles as to who would hold down
the second hassock. This was joy-
fully dismissed when the veteran of
two seasons reported in the Spring.
“Ratch” has handled himself in good
style at second and has wielded the
old slapstick for an average of .213
this year. The appreciation of the
student body follows him for the
valuable services he has rendered,
and wishes him the best of success
in anything that-he may attempt.

First Base

As the bleachers will have it,
“Caruso” has sung first base for tlie
‘Wildcat nines for the past tw6
years. To let the pill amble down
the first base line is to chalk up
another out, as “Dug” is death on

Armond London Currie
Pitcher
p**

“Buck,” this year’s Captain and
mound artist has performed on the
team for a trio of years, The “Big
Boy” had a splendid season this
year, winning five of seven games
which he twirled. His change of
pace completely baffled the opposing
batters and 52 were retired via the
strike-out route, giving him an
average of more than 7 per cent

me. “Buck” handled himself with
the ease of Pavowla this year, only
one error being chalked up against
him. He will be back into the fold
next year and ready to assume his
portion of the work on the slab.

William Henry Miley
Pitcher
p**

“Bill” has been shoving the apple
across the pan for the honor of
Davidson ever since his Fresh year.
During his second year his arm went
back on him, but this year found him
in prime condition. He won two
and lost two, one of these being
against Georgit Tech. The “Smil-
ing Shipbuilder” made a name for
himself, when he twirled a no-hit
contest against Elon. Only 27 bat-
ters faced him. Besides having a
good year on the mound “Bill”
wielded the willow for an average
of .231. He will be back next year
to assume his regular duties and

“Vernon” has romped around the
third hassock for the past three

pick-ups. He leads the infield with|¥¢@75 on Wildcat teams and_well

only seven errors in 165 chances for
an average of .959. Many are the
times he has picked up almost im-
possible throws and retired the op-
posing side when a score seemed un-
avoidable. His departure this year
will make another breach in the
Wildcat defense, but we wish him as
much fortune in picking up the old
“simolians” as-he had in baseball.

ling himself like a veteran from un-
der the big tent, the cheerful lad
from the Old Dominion accepted 65
chances at the hot corner with onl

three errors. Not ‘satisfied with
this dandy fielding average, “Ver-
non” led the team in hitting this
year, swatting the old pill for an

Violas Diana Johnson
Catcher
D*

We don’t know where he derived
his nomenclature from, but “Cop” is
what he goes by and be it known to
you that Cop is one of the backstops
on the team. This blond youth
broke into the limelight during his
Soph year, holding down his position
alone for the whole year. This year
he has been laid up on account of
sickness during the greater part and
has participated in only three games,
having a perfect fielding average to
his credit. This young gentleman,
better known as the “Human Chat-
ter-box” will be back to contend for
the position behind the plate.

Simeon Mayo Wrenn
Catcher
D
Backed by service as former Oak

Ridge backstop, and later as catch-
ing on A. E. F. teams Wrenn came

to us as somewhat of a dark-horse. | «

While on the field this diamond
artist puts everything into the game,
and used a great deal of judgment in
sizing opposing batters up. He
works his pitcher with uncanny skill,
and when all is said, pro and con,
Wrenn is as good a backstop as has
been encountered this year by Wild-
cat teams.

Undoubtedly the “find” of the
season, as the baseball circles at
Davidson will have it. Coming to.
us entirely unknown, this Wilming-
ton lad has won a warm place in the
hearts of the student body for his
services on the team. As a pitcher
“Shep” twirled the majority of our
heavy games this year and only won
one of the five he twirled. He hit
the sphere for an average of .272 in-
cluding four doubles. He leads the
team in runs scored with 13 to his
credit. With better support next
year, “Shep” will enjoy a banner
season.

Friel Montgomery Cassell
Short:Stop

“Frog”’—as the midget lad from
the state of presidents is known by
—put up a dandy brand of the na-
tional pastime at short, but was laid
up when the season was half over
with the mumps. His loss was
severely felt as he gathered in
everything that came his way while
performing in ‘his position. This
former A. E. F. man was no slouch
at the bat either, wielding old betsy
for an average of .222. With bet-
ter luck next year, “Frog” will be a
valuable asset to the club.

H. R. Stuffetetler
Short-Stop

-. D

“Huff? put up a good game at
short this year and handled himself
with much grace. He only par-
ticipated in seven games, but show-
ed that he has the goods and with
more experience under “Dutch’s”
coaching, he will make a valuable

man.
Oren E. Poe
Right Field +.
Reminding us very forceably o
the mysterious “Edgar Allen” ‘nar-
tatives, this young lad who claims
the same surname, blew into our
midst just before the season opened
and proceeded to land a berth on the
team. After an investigation how-
ever, the faculty ruled him out and
prevented him from winning his let-
ter. Poe participated in five games,
hitting the pill for an average of .263
and fielding .100. Better luck next
year old lad.
