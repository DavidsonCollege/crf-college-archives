Around the horn

What ever happened to the good old days? -

By HAP BRYANT

As the baseball pennant races
draw to a close, let’s look at some
of baseball’s all-time great feats.
After all, . statistics and records
comprise the crux of the sport, so
what better way exists to explore
and remember baseball’s great

past?

First, the 56-game hitting
streak of Joe DiMaggio. in 1941,
the “yankee clipper”. took the

American League by storm, hit-

ting safely in 56 consecutive

games. In those days, no team —

existed west of the Mississippi, so
travel was not as extensive as it is
today. Although Milwaukee’s
Paul Molitor flirted with the re-
cord this summer, he could only
reach the 39-game plateau before
being stranded on deck against the
Indians. Before Molitor, Pete
Rose established a new National
League mark in 1978, hitting in 44
consecutive contests. Due to tra-
vel and injuries today, many ex-

perts say DiMaggio’s streak will
never be broken. They said that
Paul Molitor’s feat was playing in
39 straight games, not really hit-
ting in those games. For these
reasons, I tend to agree on the per-
manence of DiMaggio’s record.

Secondly, Don Drysdale’s 58
scoreless inning string for the Los
Angeles Dodgers in 1968. Hold-
ing major league hitters scoreless
over 9 innings is a feat in itself.
The great pitchers of today (what
few there seem to be) usually col-
lect 4 or 5 each year. in 1968,
Drysdale collected 6 in a row and
4 innings in addition. Obviously,
this record seems unreachable
today. Just a few days ago, To-
ronto eclipsed an age-old mark by
hitting 10 home runs in 89 inning
game. The advantage is currently
moving toward the hitters, as the
human arm remains the same in
the face of better bat and ball tech-
nology, as well as strength train-
ing, aiding the hitters. Such a

scoreless inning streak would: be
all but impossible today.

Thirdly, Bob Gibson’s season
earned run. average of 1.12 in
1968. Gibson struck fear into the
hearts of batters with his powerful
delivery, his tailing fastbal\. and
his competitiveness. Gibson
would stand on the mound, an im-
posing figure at 6’6” and glare
down the opposition. By then he
had already won most of the bat-
tle. Then he came in with his 95-
m.p.h. fastball or his 90-m.p.h.
slider, catching the batter totally
unaware. Like Drysdale’s feat,
Gibson’s E.R.A. mark could

stand for decades if the hitters

continue to improve.

Fourth, Lou Gehrig’s con-
secutive game streak. In his career
for the New York Yankees, the

““4ron horse” played in 2,130

Straight games. He played with
broken fingers and toes as well as
through illness. Hé led the Yan-
kees to seven world champion-

ships in the 1920’s and 1930's.
‘Like DiMaggio’s record, present
conditions make this mark un-
reachable. Although Steve Gar-
vey played in many games for the
Dodgers and Padres over the last
decade, he finally fell victim to in-
jury in a game 2 years ago and was

forced to sit out. The Braves’ Dale -

Murphy had a long streak of con-
secutive games as well, but the st-
rain of travel took its toll, and his
manager decided to rest him
periodically to enhance his perfor-
mance. Thus, though active
players may try, the 162-game
season and travel fatigue make
reaching gehrig’s mark impossi-
ble.
Lastly, the pitching record of
Cy Young. In 21 years of service,
Young compiled a record of 511
wins to 315 defeats. Although the
winning percentage may not seem
that great, the mark of 511 vic-
tories probably will never be at-
tained again. Defeating major
league teams 20 to 25 times a sea-

‘11

son is considered an accomplish-
ment these days: In order for a
pitcher to gain 511 career wins, he
would have to win 20 games for
over 25 years. Aman would have
to be almost immortal to accom-
plish this feat. Once again, travel

_and the long season take their toll

and diminish the player’s prime to
about 10 years, if that long. Thus,
Young’s record will stand firm for
decades to come. —

These precedents set in the
glory years of major league
baseball amaze us today. How
could such marks be reached? We _
must credit the fortitude of the
human athlete, who overcomes
adversity and continues diligently
in quest of his goal. Baseball is

‘unique because these individual

accomplishments must occur in
the larger team-oriented realm. In
this area, the next month will
prove crucial in determining what
figures will outlive themselves in
the legends of the 1987 world
series.

Cheap seat seat comments: the pennant races

By KEN BOGERT

An excellent year for major
league baseball. Yes, this year
outshines any in recent memory.
Attendance increases in both the
American and National leagues
| prove that baseball has never been
| so entertaining. Question: why
has the baseball fan returned to the
park? Answer: the fan most likely
has come down with pennant
fever. With the fierce competition
in all four divisions, no one team
has dominated play in any of
them; many teams from all across
the nation have stayed in their re-
spective races right through the
“dog days of August” and into
September. The closeness of the
races has made baseball exciting
to watch in many cities and has
brought fans to the ball park.

Last year, the Mets ran away
with the N.L. Eastern Division.
By early September they had al-

ready Clinched the divisional title.
Baseball fans in New York were
excited to be sure, but what about
fans in St. Louis, Philadelphia,
Montreal, Chicago, and
Pittsburgh — they had nothing to
cheer about since their teams were
already mathematically elimi-
nated. The other three divisions
were closer than the N.L. East,
but far from being a race to the
wire. The Red Sox, Astros, and
Angels outclassed all their oppo-
nents by a reasonable margin.
Without the excitement of close
pennant races, the fan got bored,
stayed home, and fell asleep in
front of the game on TV which the
Mets won anyway, ho-hum.

This year has been different.
Fans in Minnesota, Oakland,
Kansas city, Anaheim, Seattle,
and even in Texas have seen their
teams of the A.L. West stick close
through the summer. Each is cap-
able of winning the division with
just a month of baseball left to

play. The same is true for the N.L.
West where San Francisco, Hous-
ton, and Cincinnati have stuck to-
gether all season. Even the lowly
Atlanta Braves could end the sea-
son less than ten games out of first
place — Atlanta fans are thrilled.
Fans with ulcers, however, are ad-
vised to stay away from western
division parks in both leagues.
The quality of baseball (from even
the first place teams) has triggered
many stomach illnesses in fans as
well as in managers this year.
Mediocrity is responsible for
keeping so many teams in conten-
tion out west.

In the. superior eastern divi-
sions, baseball remains beautiful
to watch unless you root for
Cleveland or Baltimore. the A.L.

East has seen the Tigers, Blue .

Jays, and Yankees play excellent
baseball. In the N.L. East, the
Cardinals, Mets and Expos have
also played well. Any one of the

six teams would sit in first place if
it was in the western division on
either league. These teams have
kept the pressure on each other,
and they have all responded posi-
tively by winning — close
games, in spite of injuries, in extra
innings, with big comebacks,
with timely hitting and pitching.
With one hundred forty games
played the pennant chasers thrive
and head for the stretch neck and
neck.

The predictions ]_ made during

‘the spring have been fair, but not

good. I liked New York and San

Francisco in the N.L., Texas and

Cleveland in the A.L. Cleveland
may wind up thirty games off the
pace. Texas will not succeed in

the A.L. West. San Francisco

looks like it will win in the N.L.

_ West while New York is close in

the N.L. East.
To update~ my predictions,

Inow re-evaluate the teams still

fighting to play post-season ball.
N.L West — the Giants have it
wrapped up. They had remarkable
play from only one. offensive:
player, Will Clark. The credit be-
longs to catcher Bob Brenly and
manager Roger Craig for turning a
mediocre pitching staff into the
second best in the league. A.L.
West — who cares? Minnesota
will probably win, but does not
have the talent-to beat anyone in
post-season play. N.L. East —
tough decision. The Cards have a
healthier pitching staff than the
Mets; but the Mets’: powerful
lineup, including | Howard
Johnson, Keith Hernandez, and
Darryl Strawberry, will put them

past St. Louis. This opinion, how-

ever, is rather biased — let’s go,
Mets! A.L. East — Detroit is old
and Toronto is young. I like youth
in this particular instance; consid-
er Lloyd Moseby, George Bell,
Tony Fernandez, and Tom Henke
as Toronto’s greatest assets.
