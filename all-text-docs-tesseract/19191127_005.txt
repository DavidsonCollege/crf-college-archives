surprised. The battalion, he stated, |

made a better showing than units
of any strictly civilian institution he
had yet visited, being better than
many units at schools which are
strictly military. He concluded his
talk with these words, “You have a
‘go-getter’ for a commandant. Get
behind him and you will accomplish
great things.”

Rev. W. H. Mills, '92, has been in-

SENIOR SPEAKING SPECIAL.
How Senior Speeches Are Written.

Spring of 1919: Prominent Senior de-
cides that he will begin work on his
Senior Oration with the opening of the
fall term,

August 21: Reaffirms his decision,

Opening of college: He decides, for
the second time, that he has too many
duties connected-with welcoming Fresh,
etc., to exert himself in connection with
things oratorical.

Oct. 15: Awakes to realization that
something must be done; rushes to
library and gets all the literature pos-
sible on subjects ranging from Watchful
Waiting to Waitful Watching.

Nov. 15 1-2: Return to room and
dumps already mentioned printed stuff
into closet.

Nov. 16 to 20: Takes trip off hill.

Nov. 17: Would have slept through
Chapel except for fact that he was—not
on the hill.

Nov. 18: Returns to hill—for minutes
in fliver. .

Nov. 2t: Finds correspondence piled
up on retutn and takes two days off to
answer it. Also has to study 15 minutes
and this consumes valuable time.

Nov, 24: Writes speech.

Nov. 25, 26, 27: Does not memorize
speech.

Who's Who in the Forum.

The Show opens on the afternoon of |

Friday, Nov, 28, at some two hours be-

which comes first but that no one will be|Fame of Band Spreads—Thanks-

able to detect it.

Friend Wilson has taken speaking so
seriously that he can think of nothing
else. During a late basketball game he
made several valiant attempts to short-
goal for his opponents.

Next to specches, time tables are the
most diligently. perused of literary pro-
duction on the Hill.

However some of the Seniors are not
too busy to “Join the Band and see the
World.”

A chair may be an illusion, but one
speaker (L, L. Wilson) is ready to in-

form interested parties that is certainly f

beats air for seating purposes.

The Senior Sergeant wio told his
men “to put their face against their
cheek” must have had the speaking spirit
too, .

The Seniors haven't shown much in-
terest in Freshmen's caps: the thing that
came in for their consideration lately
was “Fool’s cap.”

Art and Artists.

H. R. McConnell will tell us of the
Possibilities of Preventative Medicine.
C. A. McGirt will then show us that
this is a Lost Art. W.C. Neel. a little
later, will show us that it is still in ex-
istence, but is A Changed Art. For the
Lack of an Idea, J. G. Richards will
take no part in this discussion.

“There is nothing new under the
sun,” but we hope the speakers won't
keep the same side of a thing turned to-
ward us all the time,

Booker decided to change his subject
at the last minute. Particulars are lack-
ing. ‘

Why should prehistoric man sound
taps for the occasion ?

DEBATING CUP WON

(Continued from page 1)
_gons are not sufficient to keep up a
traditional custom that injures us,
that a tremendous percentage of

| fore sunset, which occurs at 4:54 (p.m.} !the population is already immigrant,

' Among, those selected from the class of
|'20 to represent her on this festive oc-
;casion some stand forth above their fel-
‘lows by virture of the things which have
been done unto them. For your con-
|sideration we present:

'  R. T. Allison, '20's opening gun who
rightfully leads us in this our crisis with
‘Our Flag. Askew and Black both ap-
pear to have planned speeches on dif-
ferent plans. Boney goes out to sea with
i The Merchant’) Marine while Booker
| settles down to Intensive Farming.
Brown’s address should be replete with
patriotism, after which Calhoun will
speak on Justice, probably for the mem-
bers of the band who precede him with
music.

The alloted ten minutes fails to satis-
fy Carwile who requires Infinity and
Cathey goes up in Smoke, Chalmers joins
in the chase of The Girl We Alt Are
After, while Craig gesticulates on Col-
ilege Athletics. Douglas comes just be-
(fore “music” with Southern Literature.

We might tell of all the speakers but
after you've heard the first assortment,
you can’t be kept away. Curiosity was
ever an impelling motive.

The saddest thing that I can think of,
As on that stage I am a-puffing ;

The bitterest cup that J can drink of,
Is just to think, and think of nothing.

Instead of that late selection from the
band, why not: “Everyone is writing
speeches now in Georgia.”

When you forget

(If you do forget)

Listen to this hint for you'll need it.
The thing to do

(When you forget)

Is to take out your speech and read it.

Except for the fact that we are not
dealing in tragedy we would run a
sequel to How Senior Speeches are writ-

‘Iiten, entitled How Senior Speeches are

spoken.

Liston announces that he has the pages
of his oration mixed up and can’t tell

that our blood is too pure to be
mingled with the inferior tide now
pouring in, that the source and
quality of immigrants have chang-
ed, that we have not assimilated the
immigrants already here, and that
this law would give us a chance to
catch otfr breath. J. M. Dunlap, the
last affirmative speaker, upheld that
the prohibition of immigration for
five years is the. proper step to take
in dealing with the problem. He
showed that the immigrants are a
hothouse for anarchy and bolshe-
vism, and unless a check is put on,
there will be an overwhelming tide
of them after peace is declared.
The first speaker for the negative
was A. M. Mitchell. He stated that
the fundamental questions to be ar-

gued were first, Is a revision of im-|.

migration laws necessary, and sce-
ond, If necessary, would the plan
proposed be the best. Mitchell said
that this was the land of freedom
for the oppressed, and only selfish-
ness would make us change our pol-
icy. Such a law would be extreme-
ly dificult to put into actual prac-
tice. Ormond held that prohibition
of immigration would be the cause
of unforseen troubles and bad feel-
ing from other nations. He showed
that immigration has been and is
beneficial to the country in many
ways. Liston, the last speaker on
the negative, reasoned that immi-
grants are in a state of social evo-
lution, and immigration has caused
a cosmopolition broadness in the
American unequaled by any people
He concluded by showing that the
world war has demonstrated the
loyalty to American ideals of the
wrongly maligned immigrants.

giving Trip Planned

The Band will go to Rock Hill,
Wednesday night, returning to the
Hill Friday evening. Automobiles
have been provided to take them
from Charlotte to Rock Hill. Mr.
R. E. Mell, who lead the singing
at our recent evangelistic services,
is the community “Y” secretary
there and was influential in getting
this trip for the band. Mr. W. J.
Roddey, Jr., is in charge of the
transportation and entertainment.
He and other Alumni will look
after the accommodations. Owing
to limited transportation facilities,
only eighteen men will be taken.
The band is to furnish the music
or a community Thanksgiving
service held under the auspices of
the Ministerial Union, the Y. M. C.
A., and the Federation of Men’s
Bible Classes. On Thanksgiving
night a reception for the band will
be given by the Winthrop College
girls.
