The Davidsonian extends its deepest sym-
pathies to Dr. Logan in the recent loss of
his father.

“Hats Off”

You've heard the old story of the block-
ing back in football—He does all the heavy
work and gets little or no recognition from
papers. However, the coach knows that his
services are invaluable—that he is a key
man in his machine. In other phases of life
there are also men like this. Take for in-
stance our business managers of publica-
tions on the campus. “The editors ofthese
publications know that without these men
the papers, magazines, or annuals, would
be far from success. We don’t want to take
any credit from the editors, but we do want
to congratulate the business managers on
the fine jobs that they do.

Especially Latimer and his staff. His job
has been a hard one. Week after week his
work has been hard, but just like the coach
realizes that the blocking back in invalu-
able, the editor realizes that Latimer and
his services are invaluable. To him goes lit-
tle of the credit but “hats off” to a hard
worker. We salute you, Latimer.

Go Easy

That glorious time has finally been reach-
ed for which seniors have waited during en-
tire three-and-eight-ninths years of col-
lege. Now even the dread of approaching
final exams is pushed back by the supreme
joy of having six, eight, even twelve syl-
inders at one’s command. When those long,
warm afternoons come, all that’s necessary
are a few gallons of gas and a crowd to
share expenses.

That’s all well and good, but listen, you
guys, please do us underclassmen a favor
and watch your step and-your speedometer.
Now the last thing that “The Davidsonian”
wants to be called is an old maid. We’re not
going to be backseat-drivers, continually
nagging you to slow down on curves and to
watch for the dumb _ pedestrian in small
towns. Anyone who has ever held the wheel
knows what a thrill it is to “let ’er out,”
and we all realize that staying behind a
pokey old wagon on a hill destroys any
Christian spirit a person’s got (of course,
if you meet a truck on the crest while pass-
ing, that destroys Christian spirits too).

We ask you, however, to look at the situ-

ation in another light. Just remember that -

we also want our cars during that last May
of our school life, and if the senior class
piles up a list of accidents and casualties,
the administration will never legally permit
us the privilege. Laying aside all sentiment-
al arguments, we ask you to drive safely
and do the underclassmen a favor. If you
want to lay up a coffin bill for your fam-
ily or become a life-long invalid, wait un-
til after June 5.

Felix

A few nights ago when the false rumor
was circulating the campus that Felix, wild-
cat mascot, had broken loose, we couldn’t

help but feel a slight touch of joy at the
prospect.

For many years now Felix has been con-
fined to the narrow bounds of a very small,
circular cage, with nothing to do day after
day but climb into his lone tree and gaze
meekly at an occasional Davidson student
who takes the trouble to call upon him, His
only excitement comes in the fall, when vis-
itors to football games on the campus stop
to admire him,

It that the administration
very easily build the mascot a larger cage,
at very little cost, thereby allowing him at
least a little more territory to explore and
giving him the diversion of having more
than one tree,to climb. If this is impossible,

seems could

then the best thing to do would be to turn
him loose; however, it is very doubtful if
he could survive long after many years of
continement and dependency upon others
for food.

As the case now stands, Felix is a very
the traditional Wildcat
spirit, being not the fighting, clawing ani-
from which athletic teams
taken a name, but instead a lonely, forlorn
creature forgotten and outcast by all save
he who brings him his food each day.

For Spring ushers in the last four weeks of

that in, but little over a month and a half
one fourth of the student body will troop
for the last time down the front steps of
Chambers and then go out into a dozen dif-
ferent walks of life, many of them never to
return again. And’so it is but natural that
many. of us (and I speak particularly of the
Senior class) mix in a few thoughts of the
college as a whole along with the common-
er fancies of the birds and the bugs and
the trees and the girls.

There are a great many thoughts that
come to mind as we Seniors face the final
»weeks of our Davidson life. Some pleasant,
some unpleasant. We have had our good
times with the bad—our and our
sessions with the Executive Committee, our
water fights and our assessments to pay for
them, our hopeful pep-meetings and our
moral victories the next day. But all in all
ours has been a good four years, and in

retrospect not many of us regret our sins
of commission so much as those of omission,
And all of us, when we get our sheep-skins«
in June and go out into the world as “edu-
cated” men to find our place in life, will
leave behind, hopes that Davidson will have
all that is best in the future (including, of
course, a football team that will someday
beat Duke).
All of this leads, by devious ways, up to
a few final words of advice to the under-
classmen, who will someday too be Seniors.
First, do not let yourself or anyone else
scorn Davidson, The college is by no means
perfect, but you won’t find another that
can come up to it in general merit of stu-
dent body and faculty. Secondly, don’t let
yourself, on the other hand, became smug
and conceited about Davidson. There is a
regrettable tendency among Davidson stu-
dents toward a self-satisfied complacency
towards other institutions. Thirdly, try to
get closer to the faculty members. A very
real part of any man’s education should be
association with cultured, educated men,
and it is surprising how nearly human our
professors seem when you know them in-
timately outside of classrooms. And finally,
be constructively critical of your college,
not only in classes but on the campus in
general. Do not condemn professors,
courses, or administrative policies until
you know all the facts, and only then when
you have some constructive suggestions to
make.
Sincerely,
SCOTTY RAYNAL,
Student.

PLEA

Despite the fact that most all

was divided on the effectiveness of
the latest U. S. move to bring order
out of the European chaos.

Chief criticism of the fault-find-
ers was that the message to Hitler
and Mussolini throws the U. S. in-
to a battle of words that is not our

College Villanovan, which said:

sistency of views in the attitude
taken by Mr. Roosevelt. We hope
that in the future the heads of our
governments will refrain from mak-
ing rash statements that will jeop-
ardize the intrinsic value of note-
worthy appeals made in good faith.
First and last they should remem-
ber that if democracy is to be safe-
guarded, let us protect it here, not
in European battlefields.”

However, in a majority were the
comments in favor of the Presi-
dent’s appeal. The Rollins College
Sandspur summarized the position
of the supporters of the President
in this fashion: “Roosevelt has tak-
en a momentous step in attempting
to force the hands of the dictators.
Although it may fail, such an at-
tempt is better than for the most
powerful nation on earth to adopt
a philosophy of futility toward a
world war. Every protest against
domination by force will swell the
tide of world opinion for peace.”

The Grinnell College Scarlet and
Black called on collegians to sup-
port the President: “He did not
blunder when he called upon the
dictators of Europe to make peace
for at least ten years while the
world’s problems could be worked
out around conference tables.
Youth, college and 6étherwise, all
over the world should thank Roose-
velt for that appeal. It is youth who
will march off to some battlefield
in the next few weeks, if some such
thing as the Roosevelt proposal is
not accepted soon.”

“THE LADY FROM KEN-
TOC?
This is one of the newest pic-

tures out, and it has come at a very
appropriate moment. Horse racing
in Kentucky came to the front dur-
ing the winter with the advent of
“Kentucky,” and then all the talk
of the Derby on Saturday has even
magnified it, but here is a racing
picture that will put the picture
and the Derby out of the spotlight:
It’s so new that there hasn't been
much publicity about it, but by all

“DARK VICTORY.”—Bette Da-
vis, George Brent, Humphrey Bo-
gart, Geraldine Fitzgerald.

And still another triumph for
Bette Davis—this could be almost
monotonous for any other actress,
but Miss Davis does everything in
a flashy, spectacular manner. Dark
Victory calls the two time Acad-
emy Award Winner to an entirely
different role; one that calls forth
a spirituality hitherto absent from
her amazing repertoire. t

She plays a complex character,
a spoiled darling of a horsy Long
Island set. But the girl is marked
for death. Her waning eyesight
brings her finally to a sympathetic
brain surgeon; an operation re-
veals that she has less than a year
to live. As she convalesces from the

surgery that failed, she loses her

heart to the surgeon, George Brent.
And he, too, falls deeply in love.
They marry, but death is always at
the door. Worse yet, the bride in
the midst of her happiness learns
of her fate. Not a cheery picture,
no; nor a kiddies show. But a
strangely exciting drama, that
shows that Hollywood can make
pictures for adults as well as for
escapist audiences.

The great “Cisco Kid,” Warner
Baxter, comes back in his favorite
and most famous role to again thrill

was the making of Baxter, and it
was by this that he came into! all
his popularity, and now he is try-

course he does not have the dash-
ing fire that he once had, but

Beware the icy blasts of May! I

think the fellow who composed
those lines about April showers
make May flowers should change it
to May icicles. But even the re-
versal of weather predictions was
not enough to prevent the rosy
tints exhibited on the fair skins of
Colonel Liipfert and Jack Holland
as they trod across the Chapel stage
Monday morning. The beach sea-
son is definitely on.

With ‘the arrival of May seniors
came into their own in the mat-
ter of quadruplar velocipedes but
along with the joy came the real-
ization that only another month is
left in which to escape from the
folds of the WPA. One senior, J.
B. Lee by name, is Rappy now that
he has a position with the cleanli-
ness campaign, which he explained
so dramatically to Prof. Williamson.
We hope he doesn't get stuck up
with his new work.

A couple of weeks ago we men-
tioned the baseball ability of Edi-
tor Toni who was safe a second on
a sacrifice by roommate Abernathy
(who loaned his girl for the Sig-Ep
function). Now we are able to re-
port that Casali is on third by
virtue of a long fly. (More literal-
ly it was a long trip by Abernathy
with the baseball team, while third
base happened to be in Greensboro.)

Not much is being said about the
dances these days; this is one thing
we all should talk up because the
last dance set of the year is al-
ways the best because of the spring

breezes and the light turning of
man’s fancy. Earl Mellen has been.
very popular on his two previous
appearances at Davidson dances
and from all reports he is greatly
improved. Start preparing now for
just as big a time as you had at
Mid-winters and you can’t fail to
have it.

In the Groove

CARNIVORA ... The goldfish
swallowing derby seems to have
run its course before reaching Da-
vidson. At least nothing has reach-
ed our ears about anybody’s eat-
ing anything particularly remark-
able on this campus.

Maybe you remember reading,
though, about the boy at the Uni-
versity of Illinoistswho achieved
glory by gulping five baby white
mice, all alive and tenderly wrapped
in lettuce. Just to follow up, we
thought we might let you know
the feat had repercussions even
here. The local chapter of the fra-
ternity of this heroic swallower re-
ceived a letter from national head-
quarters the other day begging the
brothers to be more orthodox in
their appetites. The mice-man, of
course, was operating unofficially,
but the fraternity felt that the pub-
licity thus gained was not of the
best nature. He did bring down the
wrath of the university officials
on his particular chapter at that.

If it will put any fraternity head-
quarters at ease, we might as well
report that Greeks here have every-
thing pretty well under control,
with most of them claiming that
their boarding houses give them
about as much as their stomachs
can contend with.

REVERIE Larry Clinton
made the statement a few days ago
(if we can believe a high school
paper interview) that his “My Rev-
ery” version of Debussy’s “Reverie”
has earned five times as much
money for the Debussy estate as
the composer made from all of his

music. Incredible, but a good story.

And _ this

rather naturally re-
minds us that our suggestion of
Clinton for Spring Dances went

for exactly naught—not that we're
much surprised. Still, probably the
Pan-Hell boys know what they're
doing, getting a “little’ but com-
petent band. There are lots of ex-
penses just at this season—house-
parties, ete—and it would be next
to impossible to get the requisite
interest aroused. Mellen was plenty
good enough_in the past, too.

Anyway, the Pan-Hells will be
needing a nest egg in a couple of
months,

ODDS AND ENDS... Most
used phrases since May 1: “This
looks like a white man’s college
now, with all these cars.”

Columnists and editorial writers
in past Davidsonians have habit-
ualty demanded some radical change
in the rules about “rush week,”
and there must have been some
talk among undergraduates to give
rise to the discussions. The total
absence of any such comment this
year would seem to meéan that the
Greeks are satisfied—or resigning
to things as they are.

We've been asked to warn Prof.
Sapp of the Soft Drink Dept. that
some of his customers are serious-
ly thinking of going up to the li-
brary to read magazines, if he
doesn’t improve the lighting ar-
rangements in the rear of his es-
tablishment.

Here’s one you can tell your Sun-
day School teacher, unless he has
a bad temper. “I call my dog Jason,
because he’s always looking for
fleece.”

NUDE NOGGIN: Latest money-

Ernest R. Tennenbaum, a sopho-

nated by his Tau Epsilon Phi bre-
thren if he’d go through with the
dare. Hair tonic manufacturers will

DORMITORY ROMEO: A Uni-

not to divulge his name—for more
obvious reasons!

PIGS: Luther College has a new
endowment building stunt that we
think is something that demands a
place in our little book of collegi-
ate oddities. To gather funds for
the erection of a new women’s
dorm, it is asking farmer friends
to donate a pig to the college in
the spring, feed it during the sum-
mer, and present the full-grown hog
or its equivalent in cash to the
college next fall. Yes, the college
is located in the tall corn state!
