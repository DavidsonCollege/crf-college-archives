Another Plea For Maturity

The Court of Control is through.

Jim Bootle startled almost every-
body by making it official. All. fresh-
man” regulations were suspended
after Freshman-Sophomore Day, even
though the sophomores won the tra-
ditional set-to between the classes.

We commend him for his move.
The Court did not have the upper-
class support it must have for effec-
tive jurisdiction. Dozens of freshmen
left beanies and name-tags in their
rooms, took as many shortcuts across
the grass as they pleased, and were
not turned in. To stick with the regu-
lations until Homecoming would have
been a hollow formality.

So what next?

Is the Court of Control, losing pres-
tige and authority each year, to stag-
ger on and on, just going through
the motions of being a tradition? We
hope not.

Last spring, in an editorial entitled
“A Plea For Maturity,” THE DAVID-
SONIAN proposed that a special ad-
visory council be created in place of
the Court of Control. Upon re-exami-

nation, we have concluded that such.

a group would likely be rather cum-
bersome, and would overlap the job
of the hall counselers.

‘So we make a fresh proposal:

1. Disband the Court of Control and .

appoint in its place a committee of
Student Council niembers, including

the Freshman Advisor.

2. Retain the more constructive of
the freshman regulations, these to
be designated by the Student Council. ,

3. Proceedings against violators
should be conducted on a more per-
sonal basis, eliminating entirely the
chapel call-downs. Offenders should
be notified of their hearing by mail
or personal contact.

4. Punishment for violators whose
guilt is proved should be as follows:

For the first offense, a warning. For _

the second offense, a one-week cam-
pus. including the weekend, unless
the defendant can prove extenuating
circumstances. For additional offen-
ses. longer campus periods, to be de-
termined by the committee.

We feel that the automatic camp-
using after the first offense would
keep freshmen from taking the regu-

‘lations lightly. It would also make

playful upperclassmen think twice
before turning in a freshman on a
trumped-up charge. .
Under this system the freshman is
not ridiculed, maligned, or embar-
rassed before he has had a chance to

defend himself. He may, however, be
punished for breaking a rule but this

punishment is levied after justice has
had its due processes.

So we make another plea for ma-
turity.

And maybe this time we'll think
before we vote.

Make Grading A Team Job

Last week THE DAVIDSONIAN in-
vestigated the possible adoption of
comprehensive examinations at Dav-
idson. It was concluded that the ad-
option of comprehensives will be .a
definite step toward student maturity
and academic excellence.

This week we will examine com-
prehensives in more detail.

When speaking of a comprehensive
examination we mean an examination
that is given to every student at the
end of his senior year covering every-
thing he has studied in his ‘major sub-
ject.

Under the present grading and
teaching system at Davidson a stu-
dent feels that he is working against
the individual grading system of his
major professors, instead of with his
professors toward some common goal.

We believe that the introduction of
comprehensives , will help to relieve
the feelings of tension between stu-
dent and teacher. Under such a sys-
tem students and professors will have
a feeling of teamwork since the stu-
dent’s performance on the compre-
hensive will not only measure his
knowledge of the subject, but will
also test how successful the professor
has been in teaching the material.

Comprehensive examinations will

assure more complete objectivity in
a professor's grading system. A tea-
cher will be able to judge whether
he has been grading a-student incor-
rectly by comparing the student's per-.
formance on the comprehensive with
his past record on other tests.

For comprehensives to improve the
academic standards at Davidson it is
essential that the examinations be
given by people outside the local col-
lege community.

We believe that the examinations
would not be nearly as meaningful
if given by Davidson professors since
there would be a tendency for a pro-
fessor to be too lenient toward a
senior after having worked closely
with the student for two years or
more.

The comprehensive examinations
should be partially oral and partially
written. The oral portion of the ex-
amination would not only test a stu-
dent’s knowledge of his major sub-
ject, but also his ability to express
himself.

Next week THE DAVIDSONIAN
will examine the application of com-
prehensives to the different academic
departments of Davidson College.

We Welcome Letters--Signed

About once or twice a semester,
THE DAVIDSONIAN receives an acid
letter from some irate reader whose
feelings have been hurt or whose
views have been crossed by one of
our editorials. We never print these

letters simply because they are not
signed.

Our policy for contributions to the
“Letters to the Editor” section is that

they be typed, double-spaced, and —

signed by the author. This policy was
clearly outlined in a box on last
week’s editorial page.

But this week, well before our Wed-
nesday night deadline, we received
one of these anonymous diatribes. It
was concerned with our opinions of
the Court of Control and with our
one-sided editorial policy. The author

suggested that we strive to become
a “fairminded paper that publishes

only letters of the right sort of .sav-
or...”

We're sorry we couldn't print your
letter, bud.

We really don’t mind printing let-
ters from people who don’t agree
with us. We like to see people think
about things, whether they think like
we do or not.

We hope you noticed that we initial
our editorials, except those by the
editor-in-chief, which traditionally go
unsigned. In other words, you know
who says what in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN.

Since we sign our opinions, we feel
that you should have the courage to
sign yours—-and when you do, we'll
be glad te print them.

Students Hit Paper’s ‘Halitosis,’
Editorial Policy, IMAC Ruling

Joe Martin

Dear Editor:
Somebody—you, I guess—is

to be congratulated for confin-~

ing THE  DAVIDSONIAN’s
chronic halitosis to page two of
last week's effort. “Less bad
breath” is only slightly less of-
fensive than the original di-
| sease, of course, but it is a be-
| ginning.

{ noticed that one para-
graph of last week’s editorial
on the Court of Control con-
sisted of the word “hogwash”
(which pretty well summed
up my opinion of the entire
editorial).

May I suggest that the rem-
edy for most of Davidson’s
“‘jlis'' is not the “hogwash” at-
jtitude, however, but a “mouth
| wash” application? If THE
‘DAVIDSONIAN pretends to be
Ithe mouth and. voice of David:
son College, then somebody
| needs to take better care of it.
, The Popular Medical Ency-
‘clopedia claims that no mouth-
| wash knewn has-the power to
: prevent a bad odor arising from
decay. but since the student
| body has opportunity to clean
house once a year, I'm sure
this is not our problem.

it is possible, of course,
for particles of rot to become
so permanently lodged in the
mouth parts that even repeat-
ed brushing will not improve
the situation. What the Ency-
clopedia prescribes for this is
more frequent dental inspec-
tion or “scientific treatment
with the removal of fhe
source.”

This is a matter for special-

just because “your best friend
won't tell you” doesn't mean
that you don’t have ‘it. It may}
be that that pipe of his has
distorted his sense of smell.

‘Dear Editor:

What is the purpose of the
IMAC on this campus? Events|
,of the early part of this week
lend importance to this ques-
tion.

Prior to the beginning of a
|flickerball game on Monday a
discussion arose as to the eli-
gibility of sophomores who re-
ceived freshman numerals in
football. The officials for the
game, the team captains, and
,the president of the IMAC
_could come to no definite con-
(clusion.

nounced that the game was

Dear Editor:

Occasionally the press may
become so over-confident in, its
responsibility for criticizing so-
ciety that we must accept our
responsibility for criticizing the
press. and for reminding it
that being’ a critic does not
free one of the quirks of hu-
man nature.

Take for example the human
fallacy of justifying means by
the end. This charge has re-
cently been used in an attempt
to have the Court of Control
abolished—a worthy end. And
yet in its striving for that end,
THE DAVIDSONIAN itself jus-
tified .an inadequate means,
shabby journalism.

tion.

Naturally, since this bad been
the status of weather in the
Glorious Past, it would always
be so. Disturbing rumors that
the seasons were warming up
and giaciers retreating were
obviously vicious propaganda.

What the shady end devi-
ous Piltdown Conspiracy fin-
enced by International Jew-
ry and spearheaded by the
infamous NAACP (Neander-
thal Action Against Clubbing
Piltdowners) hoped to gain
by such tactics was e bit ob-
secure, still. ..

So, when solar radiation did

change its character, and the
ice did melt, and frozen swamps
became trackless morasses, and
the lush beauty of spring cov-
ered the brave new Pleistocene
world, P.E. was first scornful,
then incredulous, and finally
very angry indeed.

his habit-hallowed route across

one day spring really came, and

There is, | think, a moral
to this tragic tale. Scripture
enshrines the melancholy cog-

Solomon to the effect that
there is a time for every-
thing, even to throwing rocks
and refraining from embrac-

Successful life depends, in
any agé from the Glacial to the

seasons and obeying their man-
dates. The wise man does not

reap in spring. He does things
in their proper time; when the
climate changes. he goes along.

But old P.E. sired a stubborn
line. His spiritual descendants
stil maintain their adamant
defiance of change; and like
their remote progenitor, when
world climate is altered by the
revolving seasons, they get
stuck in the mud.

Tuesday was.a great. day for Davidson; it brought
this year’s initial ROTC drill. It was a sight to bring a
lump into one's throat; six hundred men, oozing patrio-
tism and eagerness to serve their country, assembling
with clockwork precision upon the drill field. It was all
very impressive, but to the freshman it was, also a bit
confusing.

Herewith we present a list of basic ROTC terms, with
explanations that will perhaps enlighten those who are
confused.

Uniform—clothes you wear. Shirts must have collars
too tight and sleeves too short. Trousers must also be
short and tight.

Brass—the gewgaws that you rub with Brasso and
stick on collars and things.

Shoes—the things that you spit on and polish until
you run out of either spit, polish, or patience. Then they
still aren't shiny enough.

Military Courtesy—what you've got to do to get pro-
moted.

Bootlicking—an even better way of getting promoted.
Attention—consists of breathing in and then quitting.

ih on Handy Glossary for the Military Minded

The Salute—a gesture of military courtesy (see mili-
tary courtesy) performed by jabbing the third finger of
the right hand into the right eye while holding the elbow
up so the blood won’t run down.

At Ease—when you ‘can scratch where you itch.

Inspection—when the Cadet Officer (see cadet offi-
cer) struts up to see if your brass (see brass) and shoes
(see shoes) and uniform (see uniform) are looking good.
You stand at attention (see attention) while he does this
and try to keep from laughing. Laughing wouldn't be
correct military courtesy (see military courtesy) See?

Apvout Face—when you put one foot behind the other
and tiun around with your weight on one [oot’s toes and
the other foot’s heel. Then you get up off the ground,
unravel your legs, and get chewed out.

Cadet Officer—one of the better bootlickers. (see
bootlickers).

Squad, Platoon, and Company—what they divided
the whole mess into to make things more confusing. Also
to give all the bootlickers (see bootlickers and cadet of-
ficers) something to yell at.when the polish isn’t the right
flavor.

With this basic vocabulary well in mind, the MS I
student should have no trouble. Of course there are
many intricacies yet to be mastered (bootlicking is a
science unto itself). These will come. with experience.

And remember: old soldiers never die. It’s against
the rules of military courtesy (see military courtesy).
