10. THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING

MOVIE

E REVI

By BryAN STEVINSON

As I sat and watched David Koepp’s “Stir of
Echoes,” I was not able to shake the nagging image
of what
Koepp,
Kevin Ba-
con, and the
other makers

f “Stir of
Echoes” said
when “The
Sixth Sense”
premiered
earlier this
summer.
Among other
things, “Eek”
must have
sprang from
their lips.

The
viewer must
give “Stir of
Echoes” the
benefit of the
doubt, as it is
based on Ri-
chard
Matheson’s
1985 novel,
and is similar
to “The Sixth
Sense” in ba-
sic premise only. But as the movie opens, Kevin
Bacon’s son (Zachary David Cope) is in the bath-
tub playing with someone we can’t see. “Does it

hurt to be dead?” he says to an empty room. Uh-
oh, is what I thought. Another movie with a cute
little kid that sees scary dead people.’ However,
the film picks up considerably when Bacon is
hypnotized by his sister-in-law (Ileana Douglas).
The hypno-
tism, which
mysteri-
ously “opens
his mind,”
leads Bacon
to start see-
ing .dead
people, too.
Atthis point,
as the music
slips into
that scratchy
violin stac-
cato that
thrillers use
to tell you
you’re about
to see some-
thing scary,
I must con-
fess that I
tensed, up
and shrank
in my seat.
After 20
minutes or
so, though, I
relaxed be-
cause the
movie settled into a well-crafted psychological
mystery.

Unfortunately, anyone who’s seen a few

STIR OF ECHOES

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1999:

television police dramas will solve the mystery
long before the end. Director David Koepp’s
adaptation of the story is far too predictable, but
Bacon’s tenacious commitment to his character’s
obsession holds the viewer’s interest.

But the
movie also
falls into the
common
horror-
movie syn-
drome of the characters putting themselves into
danger for no particular reason. For example, after
Bacon’s wife (Kathryn Erbe) has a chance encoun-
ter with a policeman that seems to know what's
happening to her husband, she wanders into a dark
alley in the middle of the night to find the policé-
man and force him to answer her questions. She
gets. her questions answered, all right, but the

After his

dangerous alleyway setup serves no purpose other
than as a vehicle to get her questions answered.
Who is the cop? Who are the people in the room
behind him threatening Erbe? None of these
questions are answered. Neither are many others.

Koepp constructs a beautiful movie — he knows
how.to use music and lighting and flashy edits to
build tension — but the whole scene seems to be
thrown together to give the audience a cheap
thrill.

Yet despite all its shortcomings, the movie
engaged me completely. And in the end, that
alone makes it worth the price of admission.
