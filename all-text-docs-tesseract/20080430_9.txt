THE DAVIDSONIAN

Lambs’ critiques sovernment

By ANJAN MUKHERJEE
Staff Writer

The Robert Redford-directed
“Lions for Lambs” is a politically
charged film that engages the audi-
ence from the first minute.

The film tells three parallel sto-
ries simultaneously: a Republican
senator trying to sell a story about
a new mission in Afghanistan, two
soldiers in the Afghan mountains
whose lives are directly affected by
this mission and an inspirational
and idealistic political science pro-
fessor at a Californian university
trying to engage a previously
active student in his class.

The film directly questions the
decisions that were made to go to
war in Iraq, as well as the rhetoric
used to try to keep the American
public engaged in the war.

Senator Jasper Irving (Tom
Cruise), a first-term Republican,
invites reporter Janine Roth (Mery1
Streep) to his office to tell her
about a. bold new plan designed to
fight Taliban forces in Afghanistan.
He says that this plan will win ‘both

the war and the “hearts and minds
of the people.”

Roth brings up past decisions on
Afghanistan that failed, noting
similarities to previous military
mistakes, while Irving keeps insist-
ing that Roth should focus on the
state of Afghanistan in the present,
not six years ago.

It seems Redford suggests that
the government tries to focus the
war on little missions in
Afghanistan to take: the American
people’s minds off of Iraq, a gov-
ernmental tactic that badly back-
fires, as American soldiers’ lives
are meaninglessly lost. The more
questions Roth asks, the more rhet-
oric Irving seems to feed her.

Irving then proceeds to tell her
that his story will be a great one to
break. Roth knows that Irving’s
version of the Afghan mission is
rosier than the reality. Through
Roth’s conscience, Redford heavi-
ly criticizes the media in its role to
glorify the war in Iraq in the
months leading up to its beginning
in March 2003.

The second story focuses on two

Marines, Arian Finch (Derek Luke)
and Ernest Rodriguez (Michael
Pefia), who are part of a mission to
weed out small groups of Taliban
insurgents in the snowy night
mountains of Afghanistan.

During the film, there is a flash-
back to Professor Stephen Malley’s
(Robert Redford) class, in which
Finch and Rodriguez argue that the
United States does not properly
take care of people who voluntari-
ly sign up to fight for this country,
starting with the education system.

The film again criticizes the gov-
ernment through these two charac-
ters whose mission’ fails due to
faulty intelligence. The initial plan
of the mission—having a group of
Marines drop from a_ helicopter
onto the mountains—is unsuccess-
ful when the helicopter came under
surprise heavy enemy fire.

Many on board the helicopter
where shot instantly, and
Rodriguez, wounded, fell off into
the snow below. Seeing that the
helicopter was about to abort its

Frustrating ‘Memento’

By KELLY FRANKLIN

It seems that Christopher
Nolan’s acclaimed “Memento” is
the Las Vegas of films: edgy,
impressive and cool but lacking
entirely in morality and substance.

Although it’s certainly refresh-
ing to have a movie that leaves you

clusion Nolan pushes his audience
to the absolute limit, as if attempt-
ing to see just how confusing he
can make things while still being
able to bring the story together in.

The human race has gone kaput
in director Francis Lawrence’s
screen version of Richard
Matheson’s 1954 novel of the same
name. Well, almost.

Meet Robert Neville, the
renowned scientist caught in the
aftermath of a genetically engi-
neered virus strain meant to cure
cancer but which instead eradicates
almost the entire human popula-
tion. Portrayed skillfully by the
Fresh Prince himself, Will Smith,
Neville is an un-reluctant hero still
hoping to find the cure that has
eluded him for years.

This recent addition to the zom-
bie genre achieves incredible spe-
cial effects until we get to the, well,
zombies. The opening scenes are
visually stunning and illustrate a
New York City already reclaimed
by nature. In his sports car, Neville
navigates through the eerie waste-

land, and Lawrence takes advan-
tage of the disconcerting atmos-

tion to details: a downtrodden

Neville turns blindly around con-
struction work, knowing, of
course, that he won’t hit anything.
He has been here hundreds of times
before, and his silent routine feels
like exactly that: a routine.

But for us, it is no routine. The
filmmakers have practically rede-
fined the chase scene in the first
few moments of the film, putting
Neville and his dog in a bright red
Ford Mustang, equipped with a
rifle and chasing down deer for
dinner. In some ways, it evokes
scenes from movies like “Jurassic
Park,” which juxtapose technology
with the prehistoric, but “I Am
Legend” takes its strength from the

moments, and hopefally the audi-
ence notes the meticulous care put
into the film's production and
attends to the plot's details accord-
ingly, as they hold both the answers
and the appeal.

Hunky Guy Pearce fills the role
of Leonard, who struggles to over-
come a disease that resets his mem-
ory every half-hour while he
searches for the man who raped
and murdered his wife.

The film begins with the murder
of Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), indicat-
ing the backwards-chronology of
the film, with brief cuts in black
and white to a forward-progressing
starting-point in time. These two

ends of the story creep ever closer
for the duration of the movie as
more and more details of Leonard’s
quest are revealed.

The audience learns about the
identity of Leonard’s foe just as he
does: Each time his memory resets
he must reinterpret the clues at his
disposal, which include the tattoos
scrawled across his body and the
annotated Polaroid shots he leaves
in his pockets.

Teddy serves as an anchor to
both the audience and the ever-dis-
oriented protagonist, attempting to
provide some stability to a very
speculative scenario, where time
runs in multiple directions and fact
rarely remains factual.

We know that the killer is a John
G. We have a license plate number.
