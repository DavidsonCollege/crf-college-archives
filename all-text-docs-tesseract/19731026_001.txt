Trustees Make ‘Positive’

Changes In Athletics

By MICHAEL TANNER
Executive Editor

The Board of Trustees today
established future volicv for the
entire athletic program of
Davidson. College President,
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. com-
mented that the changes
represent a_ significant shift
toward a positive program of in-
tercollegiate athletics and
physical education.

To assure its program, the
board has determined the
following as college policy:

First, the program of
national-level basketball will be
maintained at full strength. A
goal of maintaining a ‘‘level of
auality comparable to the
hi t level so far achieved”
will be pursued and the basic
expenses for the sport will be

funded by the college.

Second, intercollegiate foot-
ball will be continued on the
bases of financial aid for
players up to the limit of their
need, college financial. support
of an active recruiting cam-

ign, and a schedule which of-
ers an ‘“‘even chance for suc-
cess.”

Third, other intercollegiate
teams, including women’s
teams, will be financially sup-
ported, enabling them to con-
tribute to the over-all athletic

program.

In light of these changes, it
was requested that the Wildcat
Club should broaden its scope to
supplement the funding of the
entire athletic program.

The trustees also stated that
all decisions on admissions and
financial aid continue to be

made only by the Faculty Com-
mittee on Admissions and
Financial Aid.

Financial aid to all students,
other than those participating
in varsity basketball, will be
limited to need, except in the
cases of honorary scholarships
(token stipends given to studen-
ts of special talents and abilities
in athletics).

The Administration is direc-
ted to conduct a thorough study
of the status and security of per-
sonnel in the Department of
Physical Education and
Athletics and to make every ef-
fort to establish and maintain
athletic facilities comparable to
the rest of the physical plant.

Chairman of the Committee
on Athletics and Physical
Education of the board, Hugh
D. Verner explained that all of
the changes emerged from
discussions among trustees,
alumni, faculty and students.

“The major principles have
the support of all these groups,”’
he said.

In a statement of their
philosoph concernin
athletics, trustees -
firmed their beleif in the value
of a strong and positive
program of athletics and
physical education as an

‘essential ingredient in David-
son’s total educational effort.”’

Such a am should in-
clude the following elements:

1) a strong and broad

of intercollegiate com-
petition with a ‘‘goal of success
at a realistic level for each

”

sport.
2) well-planned and

developed physical education
demanding a basic proficiency
in selected sports and a
knowledge of health-related and
hygene subjects.

The trustee guidelines call for
extensive and well-organized
programs of intramural and
club sports, affording
maximum _ student __s—par-
ticipation. Special attention is
likewise to be given to life-time
and carry-over sports, and
sound management and
reasonable cost are to be
stressed in all of these areas.

“‘We want athletics to develop
in a positive way for the benefit
and enjoyment of the entire
student body,’’ Verner said.

Verner emphasized that the
positive nature of this entire
plan is to be recognized above
anything else.

“It’s important to think of this
as a move toward something, as
a step ahead, rather than a
move away from something
else,’’ he said.

Spencer added that, ‘‘these
changes weren't born out of
desperation, but rather out of a
need for realism.”’

BLACKWELL, EDITOR OF THE MECKLENBURG GAZETTE

Up to this point the Mecklenburg Gazette has largely been a one-
man operation. With the resignation of Taylor Blackwell, a major
shakeup will occur in the printing procedures of both the Gazette

and THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Nixon Actions Cause Widespread Dissent

By PHILLIP BISHOP
Associate Editor

President Richard Nixon
fired Watergate prosecutor Ar-
chibald Cox last Saturday
because Cox continued to
demand the release of the
presidential Watergate tapes.
Three days later, Nixon
released those tapes.

Davidson campus reaction to
the president's latest man-
euvers included anger, dis-
belief, and confusion.

An informal sampling of
student opinion both before and
after release of the tapes
revealed almost universal op-
— to Nixon’s dismissal of

“We have to get that man out
of office before we don’t have a
country left,’ said one
sophomore of Presitient Nixon.

Condemnation of Nixon’s ac-
tions was not universal. Several
students believed the President
was at least partially justified

in firing Cox.

“‘Crook that he is, Nixon was
going on the principle of
refusing to violate Presidential
confidence,’”’ argued a soph-
omore supporter of the Prés-
ident.

Students saw mixed motives
behind Nixon’s firing of Cox.
Few believed the dismissal
came just because of Cox’s in-
transigence on the tapes issue.

“Cox was homing in on God

STUDENTS VIEW RECENT GOVERNMENT SHAKEUP

senior Jeff Hasty. ‘‘What looked
at first like a stupid move by
Nixon has gotten rid of Cox. It
certainly disrupts the momen-
tum of the investigation.’”’

Sue Cunningham said Nixon
was “running scared and not
because of what is in those
tapes.’’ She added that tapes
are easily altered.

“By Nixon’s rationale, han-
ding over the tapes is a show of
weakness,’’ explained senior
Doug Berry. Berry attributed
Nixon’s dismissal of the special
prosecutor to the ‘‘same old
Nixon paranoia and a dislike for
Cox’s personal arrogance.”’

Impeachment of the Pre-
sident received mixed sup-
port. ‘‘Impeachment would be a
good idea, if done as an in-
vestigative procedure and not
just to oust the President,” said
Assistant Director of the college
Union Duff Bruce.

A sophomore countered that
impeachment might result just
in further internal division and
international embarassment
for the U.S.

Senior Bonnie Henesy said
she could not understand Cox’s
motivation in refusing to com-
promise. It could have been per-
sonal egotism or a desire to
save his job, she added.

One negative result of the
tapes dispute is the resignation
of Attorney General Elliot
Richardson.

“Richardson was the one

the company for six years, is
selling to Banner Publishers,
Incorporated of Camden, S. C.

Blackwell cited two primary
reasons for selling the com-
pany. First, he feels that the
Mecklenburg Gazette needs a
broader base to work in. “This
is an important step forward for
North Mecklenburg and the
Mecklenburg Gazette,”’ he ex-
plained

“During the past half decade
the Gazette has moved from
a position of one of the State’s
smaller papers to a mid-size
weekly with circulation of over
3000 newspapers with 14 to 16
page editions.”’

The Mecklenburg Gazette has
begun to feel the pressures of
community expansion, and
Blackwell believes that this will
reach a decisive point in two or
three more years.

Blackwell is also selling his
newspaper for personal
reasons. ‘I have enjoyed my
work the newspaper
with the entire North Mecklen-
burg community,” said Black-
well.

He added, however, that he
wants to rest from newspaper
work for a while.

The Banner Publishing Com-
pany will announce the name of
a new editor of the Mecklenburg

Gazette in the near future. He
will be based locally.

Time Change

that their clocks should be

Sunday as the U. S. returns
