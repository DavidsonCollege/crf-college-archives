the super-spy

got to the place |

and realized I'd forgotten the combination —_ ro
so | tried escaping the trap _ - |

| got to the top, the wall was high

both sides shot and killed me

As | lay there

the rain washed the luck from my eyes

where you live - Loge

exists just fog

in the land of haze

and simple dreams

| can’t see you sometimes when I’m there
and when it burns off

we're in two different worlds again

me in ice/fire place of cruel hard wonders
height’s depth

and you

with Christopher Robin

in the Snow Queen’s Palace

ruddy cheeks, bright eyes, fall and spring.

I’m beginning to think you want nothing Sf my
world

and | just want a bridge to your world
but

it'd also breach your walls

and allow the K’rang in mine to scuttle
into

Tiger’s garden.

Je t'aime ma cheri de mon couer
et au revoir.
