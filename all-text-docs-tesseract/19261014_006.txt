PLANS BEING MADE

(Continued from page pe
On this night each of the classes will give a
stunt, and the Glee Club and Dramatic Club
will also provide some entertainment. The
Dramatic. Club will present several short
plays, and a general good time will be had
by all.

For the last few years Home-coming Day
has been one of the biggest days of the year,
and the program this year promises to be
even better- and more interesting than in
previous years. The students are given a
holiday, and this year the big football en-
counter will add to the other features of
the day. The day will be enjoyed not only
by the students, however, but by the faculty
members and visitors as well.

The fifth, and one of the best “Y” serv- |
ices of the year was conducted by the
students under the leadership of Bill
Christian, last Sunday night. Thé pro-

participation of those.present. Special
mimeographed programs had been pre-
pared and were handed to each student.
These programs included quotations |
from Kipling and Beeching. , Special |
music including a violin solo by James |

ines Twenty Men Report For

Letters to be Awarded Men
This Year

As the school year is moving on, the)
“Y” officials are watching with great |
interest the different bureaus and and they |
give us the happy report that everything
is moving steadily on, according to the
schedule made out at the first of the
year, and especially gratifying is the fact
that more interest is being evinced in
“Y" activities this year than ever before.
So everything seems to be prepared for
a’ most successful year in all lines of re-
ligious activity.

The candidates for the Davidson cross-
|country team have already donned their
| track outfits and are working out on the
'cinder path at Davidson College. Ap-
| proximately 20 men are in the number,
from which seven will be chosen to rep-
resent the school. A new feature of this
sport is the awarding of letters this year,

live for him.”

Closing the program, Bill Covington
spoke on the subject, “Work and Serv-
ice.” He called attention to the fact that
the words of “Work and Service” were
largely used. Work often cajrries the idea
of drudgery; service often regarded as
artificial goodness. Work is a means
to a well adjusted life. Men and women

On Sunday, October 24th, the “Y”~is |
going to bring another fine man for the|
Vesper service. Mr. Tom Glasgow of
Charlotte will be the speaker. Mr. Glas-
gow is a prominent business man,
handling all sorts of automobile acces-
sories, and is also an elder of the First
Presbyterian Church, of Charlotte. He
is an excellent speaker and has been here
before, each time adding to his popu-
larity. His message will be of a rather
practical nature and one that is to be
greatly looked forward to. Mr. Glas-
gow is one of the many wonderful men
the “Y” is going-to bring to Davidson
this year and the bureau on speakers,
which is under the charge of C. G. Davis,
feels very, fortunate in having secured a
man of this type.

Here’s—a-reat treat in store! Dr. Ben/|

Lacy is going to begin a series of meet-|
ings here on November 7th. This -very |
popular minister will have charge of the!
regular fall meeting of the “Y.”

Services are conducted every Sunday
afternoon out at the convict camp. This
is indeed a great work, for by the influ-
ence of meetings such as these, some poor
soul may be brought to join the army of
Christ. C5

Prayer—what really composes prayer?
This is the answer that a Church paper
sends out:

“True prayer is only another name for
the love of God. The true prayer is that

/of the heart and the heart prays only for
_ what it desires. To pray, then, is to de->
| sire—, but to desire what God would have
/us desire.”

Can we not let this most powerful fac-
tor of life enter more into our daily
routine? Much of peace and comfort of |
heart awaits him who enters into this
close fellowship with his Creator. So let

| us strive to be worthy of this soul-com-

munion and by its guiding hand become |
better Christians in every way.
