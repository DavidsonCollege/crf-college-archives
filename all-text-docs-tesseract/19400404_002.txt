—A New Librarv

With. the announcement that lunds have
been secured for a new college hbrary Da-
vidson's building program comes one step
nearer completion, Our unknown bene-
iacior deserves many thanks ior his gener-
ous and liberal gitt of St80000. Men like
this are few and iar between, and the col-
lege is iorumate to be able to count a few-
such men as their sinecre iriends. —

This building will be erected with a view
toward a greater Davidson of. the future.
when the campaign shall have been com-

pleted, and the college can match the quali-_ |

ty of the student body and iaculty with
material buildings. The new. library will
probably be the jirst of the four structures
whieh will some day be tocated at each
corner of Chambers, forming 2 center jor.
alt classes and aetivities. With such mater-
ial growth it will be possible to acconimo-
dale a greater number of students, it that
is thought to be desirable. but more students
‘or the same number as at present hardly con-
cerns us now. The immediate need is for
the completion of the. building program.
Even now it is not too early to look for-
ward to the next thing on the slate, amother
modern and well-equipped building. At pres-
ent the greatest needs are for a new gvm-
nasrum, scienee building. and church. All
are pressing needs, and each has arguments
im its favor, but to. tts it appears that she
college is most sadly lacking in gymnasium
laeilities at present. and because of that it
is our hope that the trustees will seek this
next. One thing must be done at a time. but
it is essential that a new gymasiam be crect-_
ed before many more years.
“It is necessary that the builk of funds
for almest any new building be given by
one person, and naturally that person has
the final say as to what his giit shail be
used for. Another consideration is the
amount of money available ior construction.
—No-one_would wish the college to start a
new gymnasium without suttieient funds to
complete an up-tocdate, weil-equipped build-
ing. But with these important factors con-
Sidered. it seems proper now that all en-
ergies be directed. towards securing funds
for a gymnasium. ' May the trustees see fit—
to direc: emphasis towards this new goal.
And may we express the appreciation oi
the entire student body to that uitnamed -
man who has given to ts a large unit of the
building program. a new library.

Express—Yours self!

During the past year there has 1 been a
yery noticeable decline in the number of
communications and letters to the David-
sonian. One of. the primary functions of
any newspaper is to publish student opin-

“ions, criticisms, and discussions. This is

especially true of a college paper. While it
is important that the Davidsonian carry
accurate news stories and feature-articles, it
is also important that it be a medium
through which students and faculty may
-make public their ideas regarding various
subjects. Without student opinion it main-
ly bécomes a dead history of past happen-
ings.

Dear Mr. Editor:

This is to comply with your re-
Guest that F-give the’ students of
Davidson College some parts of the
conversation that we had this morn-4
ing with reference to the next

our campus. [It should be stated. 1

out of our observations of the en-
thusiastic applause which followed
President Lingle’s announcement}
that the need -for a new library on
our catnpus has been met. 0

The students undoubtedly would
like to_see_a néw gymnasium or a
jield house built, next.-L_know of
no one familiar with our present
equipment who does not see this
existing need 6f> who does not
concur enthusiastically in a desire
to see this need fulfilled. It is pos-
Sible that some member of the
“buying” public, inspired by the gift
of the new library and the per-
petuation of the memory of two
great ‘individuals, will be. inspired
to meet, this other great need. As
we think of the next building to
be erected. let me request that
we exercise some patience. Colleges
are not built in a day.’ The financial
history of Davidson for the past}
twenty-five years or longer has|
been one of steady growth. Every
urgent need has been met. The pic-
ture is dark at times and then, as
a dividend on an endowment of
prayer, comes from .some source,
sametimes . least expected, some
wonderful gift, such ‘as the Duke
Endowment .or the library  build-
ing. It might be noted here that
the library gift is the largest sin-

received as an outright gift from |
any living donor.

Then. too: let's remember that
Davidson is not “broke”. We have:
a: considerable available cash bal-!
ance and Centetinial pledges yet
uncollected. It would be a wonder- i

‘ful boost to our plans and our spirit

if some individual could be inspired
to provide a new gymnasium or
field house‘Nf this be impossible; I
see-no reason why representatives
of the trustees, the faculty, and the
administration could not decide that
a gymnasium is now our most.nced-
ed building, and take available
funds, less than ‘half enough -to
erect a new gymnasium, proceed
with collections, and seck addition-
al funds. It has occurred to me,
too, that if students now in college
would join in a campaign to raise
from their friends an average of
N00.00 per student, 1 beljeve the
College could match such a fund
and proceed promptly to erect the
next né@w building.

Some students have asked why a
gymnasium was not built instead of
Duke Dormitory: Fhe answer—is
the dormitory was built ‘with in-
vestment funds and it is expected
to produce revenue just: as the
Fraternity Court or other endow-
ment investments. Had a gymnas-
ium been built instead of a dormi-
tory, the College’ would not only
have lost ‘the income of such an
investment, but would have incur-
red an additional burden on our
limping budget to provide operating
and maintenance funds which a
modern building requires.

With reference to the library, it
might be of interest to know that
many of the better New [england
colleges will not accept. money? for
the erection of a new building un-
less it be accompanied by a sum
equally as large for aa endowment
to provide revenue for the opera-
ton and upkeep of the buildiiig.
With us and our new library, it is
fortunate that. the Living Endow-
ment income promises sufficient in-
crease in revenue to provide
creased maintenance costs.

° Very truly yours,
F. L. JACKSON, Treasurer.

Collegiate Review

By Associated Collegiate Press .
Professors at the University of Pittsburgh
don’t need marriage relations courses! This
was brought out im a survey of marriage
“ligures among the elite of the faculty;
93.8 per cent of the University’s professors

marriage rate of only 61.1 per cent.

To put this into a more concrete example, 4
nearly nine and one-half profs out of ten
are married. The national figures, taking
in even the Ozark mountains, average only
siX persons out of ten. The marriage rate
among profs doesn’t carry over to other
university employees, however. Only 67.4
percent of the officers, faculty, and cleri-
cal assistants of the University are married.
This is still above the national figure.

The latter marriage rate was discovered
when 515 out of 1,581 persons were found
unmarried.

By FRANK BARKER

Having just come from room 105
West and read the remarks of one
of my beloved brothers in_ the
Question of the Week column - it
not only gives you all but myself

| pteasure to hand over thiswork |

some other sucker who falls for the |
artistic and smooth talk of the
new. editor. But, thanks for read-
ing, ye. few who did. .
“As a parting ling, it might be in-
teresting to some of you to read
one part of an affirmative argu-
ment that we met on our recent
debate trip. This was the idea of
switching our foreign trade ‘from
belligerent nations to South and
Latin American countries. Of
course, this can be refuted some-.
what by the. fact that sixteen of
the twenty Latin American repub-
lics are tropical or semi-tropical.
the 8,000,000 square—miles of
land, 7,000,000 drecin these tropics.
Our agricultural experts are of
the opinion, however, -that. with the
aid of present day research, techni-
cal guidance, and with help on the
organizing side, these nations could
be made to produce a great amount
of our need for quinine, medicinal
plants, and most important, rubber.
This latter material, Henry Wal-.
lace, the Secretary of Agriculture

of the New Deal..Administration
says, comes from the Far East at
the present time, but if we are
really serious about a policy of iso*
lation, we should encourage the
production of this article by our
néighbors in the south. -Thus, our
sources of supply would be close
to home, and over water routes
that could casily be protected by
our navy.

Another point which they brought
out is made in favor of having
them produced in Latin America.
It may-discourage the production of
cotton and other semi-tropical pfo-
duets which now are in competition
with our farmers. For example, in
Columbia, they are trying to raise
wheat, cotton and rice when, ac-
cording to our experts, they could
more efficiently raise quinine and.

other tropical products.
Fallacies in this argument are
hard find ‘except for the jungle

area_which covers so much of this
territory. Also the bad will which
would come as a result of taking
our trade away from Great Britain.
Fraice, Canada, and other allied
belligerents, enters into the conflict.

[t should be interesting to us to
note what action.Congress will take
on this measure.
