The Davidsonian

The Senate voted in favor of
a ‘‘bad check’’ committee. The
committee will act as a liaision
between the business com-
munity and the students who
write illegal checks. ‘
Support for the motion was
based on the fact that it will
help maintain the college’s
“good name”.
Bill Peeples (Cannon), head
of the effort to organize the
committee, said it will contact
the offending student, If this
notification does not work, the
matter will be turned over to
the Dean of Students Office.
The Dean presently handles
students’ bad checks.
_ The Senate was asked to
endorse the Dean of Students
practice of withholding a stu-
dent’s grades until the bad
check is covered. Dana Eng-
iish (Carnegie-Little) said that

Dial-a-lumni puts students
into fund-raising campaign

By DAVE KELLER

Approximately 200 stu-
defits will be phoning David-
son alumni al] over the nation
spring term in a campaign to
solicit pledged contributions
to the Living Endowment.
Called the Student Involve-
ment Committee, the group
will duplicate on a massive
scale a similar project under-
taken last year by a small
group of students who phoned
alumni-in the-Charlotte area.
‘The important thing is
that we're getting students
involved,’’ says Tom Bern-
hardt, administrative coordin-
ator of the project. ‘‘Other
colleges, by doing the same
sort of thing, have found that
the students are most know-
ledgeable about what a school
needs and can therefore better
inform alumni about where
their money will be used.”
The money raised will go
into the general college fund,
to be used for operating ex-
penditures and college func-
tions. ,
Bo Baskin, who helped on
last year’s project, said, ‘‘I
feel like the alumni last year
appreciated students calling
them; they got a good chance

nights a 2 week for three weeks
at the beginning of spring
term; dates for those nights
are March 14-17, 21-24, and
28-31. Sixteen students will
dial from 6:30 to 9:30 pm each
night.

Callers for each week will be
under the direction of two
weekly co-chairmen who are
Nancy Brown. and Mary  |-
liam for the first week, Cliff
Hester and Tim Goodell for
the second week, and Bo
Baskin and Marc Menchell for

The committee is looking for
people to call one night or
more; an outline script will be

* provided to all callers.

Baskin added that, ‘“‘Doing
this is a great way fof students
to come to grips with the
difficulties of raising money
for college operation. It’s a
great way to get involved.’’

Bernhardt summed up. the
importance of the phoning
effort by saying, “I feel that
students doing this will do
more for Davidson than they

Point of order

‘Bad check’

this policy 1s an “unnecessary
interference in a student’s
personal affairs.”’

Peeples said this was their
only means of enforcement
and that it was only used in
extreme cases.

The motion passed by the
Senate does not include any
reference to withholding
grades. The practice, however,
will continue to be used by the
Dean.

In an effort to have ‘‘well
educated Senators”, President
Thom Young invited Roger
Brown to speak to the Senate.
Brown is in charge of ‘‘Dial-a-
lumni”’ for the Living Endow-
ment Fund.

“Dial-a-lumni” involves
students telephoning alumni
to seek money for the Fund.
The effort is scheduled for the
second through fourth week of
spring term.

Mark Rabil, representing
the Council’on Campus and
Religious Life, explained the
recent decision on the status of
Rusk House. It was decided to
‘recommend to President Spen-
cer that the house be given to
the women’s group.

He stated that the freshman
group, which was also in con-
tention for the house, has ‘‘a
good case for victim of the
year.”

The Council has established-

the ideal of: ‘'a movement
toward coeducational houses.”

’ They have formulated a ‘ hard

core non-discriminatory po!-
icy” that ‘“‘goes further than
Title 1X.”’

He emphasized, however,
that the Council will ‘‘not

chairmen will be assigned for
each night.

‘Hopefully we can get fra-
ternities, clubs and other cam-
pus groups to provide callers
for a night or two and start
some friendly competition ov-
er pledges received,’’ said
student coordinator Roger
Brown.

Calls will be made from the
student organization office
room in the Union, and. sarid-
wiches and beverages will be
provided at 6 pm every night.
Every caller also gets to make
a free three minute call to

The Security Committee is
chaired by Hans Watford
(Sentelle), and includes Ralph
Yielding (Belk), Randy Haines
(Belk), Bruce Brown, and
Stuart Bondurant.

The purpose of the group is ©
to increase student awareness
of the security situation.

They plan an “evaluation of
security’’. This will include
talking to both students and
the police about security pro-
blems. The committee wants
to work closely with The Dav-
idsonian and the freshman
halls to inform students on
security matters.

Watford stressed the value
of members of the college
being aware of ‘non-college
people on campus. These peo:.
ple should. be reported to the
police so they can check the
situation. He emphasized that
suspicious people should not:
be confronted by students.

Dean Terry, Shaw Smith,
and a police represeritative will:
be invited to the next commit-
tee meeting.

_ The Trustee Day, planned
for February 14, has been
cancelled. Thirteen trustees
were invited and seven replied.
All who replied expressed
enthusiasm for the idea, but
only one could attend.

The Senate budget, which”
contains $3500 and a surplus- -
from last year's budget, was
discussed. The money is avail-
able for committee work, in-
cluding research and the
