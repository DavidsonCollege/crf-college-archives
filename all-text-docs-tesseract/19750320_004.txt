Misplaced Priorities

President Spencer’s decision
to renovate the present college

union to serve as a guest house.

comes as a great disap-
pointment but as no real sur-
prise. There may be no more in-
dicting commentary on the

misplaced -priorities of David-.

son College than this act
eliminating temporary space
for the art department to ac-
comodate guests visiting the
campus. The educational func-
tion of the college is apparently
secondary to its function as a
showplace for visitors on Dr.
Spencer’s priority list.
Contradicting the .conclusions
of the Budget, Buildings and
Grounds Campus Planning Sub-
committee and the Goals Com-
mittee, President Spencer ef-
fectively eliminated present
growth for the graphic arts
program at Davidson and
reduced the Goals Committee to
a public relations rubber stamp.

_ Dr. Spencer, having made a
final decision Thursday evening
at the Board of Trustee’s
Executive Committee meeting
to renovate the building as a
guest house, sat through the en-
tire Goals Committee meeting
the next day without informing
the committee of the decision.

The Goals Committee again
stressed the need for the art
department to occupy the
college union facility.
Having already decided the fate
of the present union building, he
obviously allowed the com-
mittee members simply to
waste their time.

Granted, the college could
benefit from.a nice guest house.
Unfortunately, the present
union is not the place for it.
Renovation of the building will
obviously be a costly process if
Dr. Spencer. intends the facility
to be at all comfortable for
college guests. The building
simply does not warrant such an
outlay of funds. It is nothing
more than a temporary struc-
ture which could fulfill a vital
need as an arts facility before it
is razed. It is hardly worth
sinking the kind of money in it
that Davidson will have to spend
to make it adequate as a guest
house.

While the college pours money
into this structure the sub-
standard chemistry facility
remains in violation of federal

safety and health standards, the’ “
‘graphic arts program will work

with only one studio, faculty
salaries and student financial
aid programs will suffer. And
the college has not even raised
sufficient funds to date for the
completion of the new college
union once scheduled to open
three months ago. The college
community will be paying for
this costly mistake for some
timetocome. —

We look to President Spencer
to begin immediately plans for
funding a new art facility if he
intends\the art program at
Davidson to remain a part of the
educational curriculum. The

Goals Corfiinittee will have to

begin again to make a priorities
list in light of this new ad-
ministrative bombshell.

Ellett’s 100th Paper

Today is an anniversary of
sorts for the Davidsonian. This
is the 100th Davidsonian on
which our productions
manager, Bill Ellett has
worked. Bill has probably spent
somewhere in the vicinity of
4000 hours over the past four

years making sure The David-

sonian is published weekly.

Bill is responsible for the pro-
duction of the entire paper, from

copy editing, advertising lay-
out, art reproductions and edit-
orial duties to equipment main-
tenance. Without him, the paper
would suffer immensely .

It is with a great deal of
gratitude and much personal
esteem that we recognize his un-
selfish contributions. °

We consider Davidson College
and ourselves in particular ex-
tremely fortunate to be the
beneficiaries of his efforts.

Thanks, Herb

Tne Davidson National Print
and Drawing Competition is
now in its fourth year. In its first
year it was the largest of its kind
in the world and is now ac-
claimed the most prestigious in
the country.

The Davidsonian would like
to express its gratitude to Herb

Jackson, who, with little
assistance from the college vir-
tually singlehandedly conceived
of and engineered this show. It
has not only established

national renown for the school -

but brought into our experience
here a quality of enrichment
unequalled anywhere.

‘Domestic Situation Shows
Other Side of Iran’s Shah” in
last week’s Davidsonian, I
could not help but think how
misguided and biased Moore
was.

He gave the readers the im-
pression that Iran is ina state of
destitution. He also hinted that
the Shah of Iran is responsible
for all the conditions that he
described. Never did Moore
mention that only villages in
certain parts of the country
have such conditions.

These conditions exist for a
number of reasons. The people
who live in villages (like the one
where Moore spent five mon-
ths) are ultra-conservative and
very religious.

They are very resistant to any
kinds of modern 20th century
changes. They refuse to tolerate
co-education. They believe that
females must not date males
before marriage.

Females must wear veils
(chadors) in order to cover
their bodies. These customs
have existed for 2500 years or
more. However, this does not
mean that such customs prevail
in the big cities.

Does Moore intend to change
these customs overnight? If he
cannot tolerate them, why did
he work in such an enviornment
in the first place?

©. Iran has improved tremen-

dously under the Shah. Twenty
years ago Iran was lacking in
education and technology. Since
the Shah came to power, the
country has become rich,
powerful, independent, and
beautifyl. Any Iranian who lives
in Iran can prove this.»
Educational institutions like
medical schools and univer-
sities thrive throughout the
country. As a matter of fact, in
1971 alone, 2500 schools were
built. If Moore decides to visit
some other Middle Eastern

' countries (I do not intend to

name any in particular), he will
find that Iran is far more ad-
vanced than these other coun-
tries.

Iran has .more educational
facilities. If Moore could have
visited Iran 25 years ago then he
would have realized how much
improvement has taken place.

For Moore's information, the
Shah donated thousands of
acres of lands (free) to thou-
sands of farmers. He did not ask
for anything in return. The Shah
devites all of his energy to-
ward world peace.

He is one of the most peaceful
monarchs in history. After all,
the Shah was the only oil
producing leader who did not
cut off oil shipments to the
United States during the Arab
oil embargo.

The Shah has given shelter to
hundreds of innocent people
who were persecuted by other
governments. To say that the
Shah has improved Iran does
not mean that Iran is free of all
mundane problems. If Iran had
no problems then there would
be no need for the U.S. Peace
Corps.

Moore knew (before he left
for Iran) that the function of the
Corps is to aid disadvantaged

environments. Maybe Moore

was expecting an environment
filled with arems, women,

wine, and song. Moore also
mentioned that, the Shah is a
customer of Rolls Royce.

Kissenger travel around the
world? Does not the president
own luxurious cars? Is_ the
United States devoid of all
problems?

Maybe Moore should visit the
area on the other side of the
tracks right here at Davidson. A
ruler, or president is entitled to
a vacation. The work demanded
of the Shah is nerve-wrecking.
Moore also mentioned that the
Shah’s pictures are on coins,
and in shops. So what if they
are.

In the United States, we find
images of George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln on coins.
It is a tradition (2500 years old)
that the monarch’s image be
engravedoncoins. <’

Iranian history can prove
that. The pictures of the kings
shops signify the people’s
allegiance to the Iranian nation.
Are Iranians not entitled to
some patriotism?

My girl friend tells me that up
to several years ago, her
teachers demanded that they
all (students) pledge allegiance
to the United States before
classes could begin. I see
nothing wrong with that. Maybe
Moore intends to change 2500
years of history overnight.

Moore also stated that the
teachers who were working
with him were paid only $45 per
week. However, Moore fails to
realize that $45 in an Iranian
village can buy you a tremen-
dous amount of merchandise.

A person can see 3 or 4 movies

' (just released) with only $1.25. I

think it is unfair to compare
United States standards of.
living with those of Iran. The
standards of living in Iran are
not as high as those in the
United States.

Therefore, to be payed $45 a |
week in a village is not a rip-off
as Moore believes. In con-
clusion then, I believe that
Moore fails to understand the
sociological concept of
“cultural relativism.’’ This con-
cept simply states that one can-
not compare one culture with

‘One must look at the culture
in question with respect to how
it has changes. In other words,
if a culture has come a long
way, it is said to have im-
proved; however, when com-
pare with another culture, it
might seem that the former is
still primitive in nature.

I sincerely hope that future
peace corps volunteers will at-
tempt to look at the Iranian
culture as unique in its own
way, in the same way that the
Amercian culture is ‘unique in
its own way.
