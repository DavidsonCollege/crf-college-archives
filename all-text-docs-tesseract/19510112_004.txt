Crusade for Freedom
Gets Strong Support
Of Loyal Americans

General Lucius D. Clay, Nation- |

al Chairman of the Crusade for
Freedom, today made public the
results of the recent Crusade for
Freedom campaign.

Although contributions and signa-
tures are still continuing to come
in to National Headquarters in the
Empire State Building, Clay an-
nounced that the number of signa-
tures of Americans on the Freedom
Scroll have passed the 15 million
mark—and that total contribu.
tions exceed $1,268,000.

“I wish to thank. most sincerely,
the thousands of Crusade workers
throughout the country who have
made this accomplishment possi-
ble,” Clay said in a letter to field
chairmen.

“Radio Moscow sneered that the
American public was being forced
to pay to join the Crusade. All

contributions, of course, were com-

of the total came from small con-

Since all campaign expenses were

contributed is being used to expand
