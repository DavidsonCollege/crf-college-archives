Beach sets new
Davidson track-record

By JAY CLUGSTON
Both the women’s and men’s track and field teams began
their 1990 season this past weekend at the Virginia
Tech\Santee Marriot Indoor Track Meet in Blacksburg, Va.
Davidson's top female finishers were Kathy Beach in the 3000
and 1600 meter (11:13.9 and 5:30.6) and Heather Tarpley in the

Beach’s 3000 meter time of 11:13.9 was a new Davidson
indoor record and bettered her previous school record time of
11:30. The men had strong performances by Ted Richardson
and Ian Stewart in the 3000m (9:21.2 and 9:23.1 respectively),
Jay Clugston in the 5000m (16:16.7) and Peter Hartado in the

The women’s next meet will be held February 3 at Virginia
Tech. The men compete February 10, also at Virginia.

A lot of people didn’t appre-
ciate my last column, but that
really doesn’t bother me. I’m
not here to please readers. |
write in order to instigate dis-
cussions among those who
happen to read my material.
Just so you know, there were a
lot of comments on both sides.
The negative ones ranged from
strong arguments to simple
threats. I guess I accomplished
what I meant to do: to get
people talking about some
problems that I saw in the ath-
letic department.

If you didn’t read this col-
umn last week, I wrote last
about the diminishing oppor-
tunities for students to use the
facilities here because of var-
sity use, disrepair/or Baker not
being open.

The few sentences which I
wrote about the baseball team
were the ones which raised the
most comment. The players
took my words as a personal
insult upon them and their

team. That was not my inten-
tion. Granted, a couple of
phrases were sarcastic and I
probably went a little far, but
those phrases did not carry the
main idea behind the column.

By now, if you haven't
stopped reading already, you
are tired of me trying todefend
myself. So, I'll just give you a
little of what was said tome this
weekend. Make up your own
mind.

Evidently, the information
on the sign which reserved the
gym for the baseball team was
wrong; the team does not have
the gym every afternoon, and
in fact, they have only used it
once this term. The team only
practices inside when it is rain-
ing.

Lots of people mentioned to
me that there’d be no problem
if Baker opened. (BINGO!)

Here’s a good one: “Some-
body oughta pinch your f——
— head off. You don’t f
belong in a f weight
room!”

Several people mentioned to
me that athletes here sacrifice a
lotin order to pursue what they
love to do. They said that this
school, in comparison to other
schools with which we com-
pete, does relatively little forits
athletes. The situations I criti-
cized were pointed to as the
only examples of this school
doing anything for its varsity
athletes. Therefore, by this
logic, they should not be criti-
cized.

Many people appreciated
what I said about school spirit.
A few said that it would be
much easier to get excited
about games if we were play-
ing true conference rivals,
Point well taken.

Others resented what

seemed like a personal attack
on one team in the same article
as a defense of another. They
see a situation where basket-
ball, no matter what the win-
loss record of the team, is more
important than a successful
Division I baseball team. My
article, they said, did not help
that attitude.

I got a lot more feedback,
more than I have space to write
here. These comments were
not all from players. There
were lots of people on both
sides of the arguments. I hope
can write another column that
gets people talking as muchas
that one did.

If you have any gripes about
anything to do with this
school’s athletic department,

let me Know by writing me, or
just stop me in the hall and tell
me.

Different topic: Danny Ford
should have been fired with no
“golden parachute.” He was
responsible for Clemson’s foot-
ball troubles, but does he get
punished? No, he gets his
mortgage paid off and over
$100,000 a year until he signs
with another school or his
original contract runs out. All
crooks should be so lucky.
Know what IPTAY (Clemson’s
alumni organization) stands
for? It’s Probation Time Again,
Yall.

Baker Complex Rumor of
the Week: Partially open by
next Tuesday.
