THE DAVIDSONIAN

Visit Africa for a week

By Laura Dennis

A week long celebration of
African culture begins this coming
Saturday. Africa Week will kick
off with Kayaga of Africa per-
forming African dance, music, and
drama in Love Auditorium. The
week will continue through Fri-
: day, February 3, with events rang-
ing from games to speakers. “We
want to bring Africa to Davidson,”
comments Benson Musila, a na-
tive of Kenya and one of the orga-
nizers. His hopes are that the week

stimulates interest in Africa, espe-

cially for people who have not
been so aware of it in the past. On
Sunday, an African arts and crafts
exhibition opens in Chambers
Multipurpose Room and the Col-
lege Union that will run through-
out the week. Several speakers are
coming who will touch on sensi-
tive issues such as the impact of
colonialism on Africa. Two films
will also be shown; one on Mon-
day entitled Sango Malo, and the
other on Wednesday called Letters

toAlou. Also on Wednesday, Vail
Commons will serve African food
for dinner accompanied by Afri-
can music. The week will culmi-
nate with a dance on Friday night
with the theme, “Africa’s Greatest
Hits.”

The week promises to be an
interesting one that hopefully will
raise the awareness of African cul-
ture on our campus. For more
specific information about dates
and times of events,. please see
next week’s Davidsonian.

The best and worst of 1994

Tom Bavis recalls last year’s musical hits and misses

By Tom Bavis
BEST ALBUM. First Prize
— Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.
Over six months after its release,
Sarah McLachlan’s third album
still leaves me fumbling towards
my thesaurus to adequately de-

scribe it. Simultaneously ethereal _

and full arrangements combine
folk, jazz, and pop into a beautiful
musical alloy. But the music only
serves as a backdrop for
McLachlan’s voice, arguably the
best in popular music.

Second Prize — The Down-
ward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails.
This is one of the greatest albums
you won’t want to listen to again
and again. That’s because its pri-
mary function is to make you re-

- ally uncomfortable, like the popu-
lar video-for one of the CD’s few
catchy songs, “Closer.” A sharp
lyrical blitzkrieg marks the album,
such as the refrain of “March of the
Pigs”: “Take the skin and peel it
back;.doesn’t it make you feel bet-

ter?” Do not take this on a roman-
tic date. :

WORST ALBUM. First Prize
— The Sign by Ace of Base. All
six million American copies are
equally vacuous. Is it 10 tracks of
uninspiring dance music, soulless
reggae, or updated Abba? All three.

Second Prize — 13 Above the
Night by My Life with the-Thrill
Kill Kult. If this album attacks
you, don’t try to be a hero. Just
begin running and never look back.
This pretentious attempt at dance
music fortunately did not sell, prob-
ably because even the world’s big-
gest posers know when their ears
are hurting.

BEST SINGLE. First Prize
— ‘Black Hole Sun.” Few people
did not like Soundgarden’s second
single from their Superunknown
album. The ‘90s triumphant an-
swer to the ‘80s metal ballad. This
song also boasts one of the year’s
best videos.

Second Prize —- The competi-

tion is so tough this year I made
this atie. “Basketcase,” their sec-
ond release from Dookie, single-

handedly won me over to Green ~

Day. With his mock English ac-
cent at its thickest, Billie Joe com-
bines ‘80s thrash with a touch of
innocent ‘50s rock to make one
energetic, addictive little tune.
Similarly, my faith in Stone Temple
Pilots grew substantially with the
second single from their Purple
album, “Interstate Love Song.”
Like “Basketcase,” it perfectly
melts a catchy ditty into hard rock.

WORST SINGLE. First Prize
— “Shine” by Collective Soul.
Hands down, this song deserves
the death penalty. A bad recording

for starters, particularly with its:-

spineless drums, this sad attempt
at the deep feel of songs like “Black
Hole Sun” fails on all counts ex-
cept airplay. Please tell me, who
likes this song?

Second Prize — “Don’t Turn
Around” by Ace of Base. The one

time I did listen to the album all the
way through, I still had to skip this
one. “Don’t Turn Around” is so
bad, it makes ‘All That She Wants”
seem to have an edge.

BEST VIDEO. First Prize —
“Sabotage.” This Beastie Boys
clip is one of the most entertaining
videos ever made. I immediately
wanted to start writing scripts for a
“Sabotage” ‘70s cop show starring
the Beastie Boys. For example:
Cochese goes underground to snag
a bunch of scummy angel dust
dealers.

Second Prize — “Closer” by
Nine Inch Nails. Like the new
album, this video succeeds fully at
its purpose of unsettling you. Shot
in a sickening brown hue, it begins
with an exposed heart beating ona
table and goes from there.

WORST VIDEO. First Prize
— “Never Lie” by Immature. Pa-
thetic, exploited preteens sing to a
girl as persuasively as Axl Rose.
Dressed alike in hip-flop uniforms
as they sing on a beach, these

movie. I first saw it when I was 13
and have rented it at least once a
year since. It’s an Italian film

about a little boy named Salvatore
growing up in a small town after
World War II. The life of the town

centers around the local cinema,
and the boy is fascinated by film.
He befriends the projectionist, an
old man named Alfredo, and the
film chronicles their relationship
and Salvatore’s coming-of-age and
ultimate departure from his home.
An incredibly poignant story.

Well, my tenure as arts editor
for The Davidsonian is about to
come to an énd. I hope you will
welcome Jacob Abraham and John
Copenhaver as the new co-Arts
Editors; they are both extremely
capable, and I think they will do a
great job.
