“Truck traffic has been a
nuisance to us,” says David-
son Myor Tom Sadler, who has
been active with the issue
since it first arose. ‘‘Our roads
weren't meant for trucks.”

Also, trailers and car-towed
boats, traveling to Lake Nor-
man, started utilizing the

‘community roads.

Finally, then commissioner

‘and Davidson graduate H.

Perrin Anderson ’56 started
working, last year, on the
by-pass.

“Anderson was a great
help,’’ continues Sadler. ‘‘He
helped us like no commissioner
had béfore.”’

What Anderson managed to
do was move the project up
five years, from a 1983 dead-
line to a 1978 one.

The by-pass might take a
little time to become helpful,

though.

“It may not solve all of our
ills--it’s kind of hard to get
throught a truck driver’s head
sometimes. He may want to
keep coming through here, but
eventually he’ll find out the
straight route is better.’’.

Other people Sadler feels ,

helped out are retired geo-
graphy professor J.W. Reed,
and Director of the Physical
Plant Grover Aétze.

Sadler remembers a truck a
few years back rounding the
corner of Concord and Main:
“That trailor just ripped the
top completely off of (a resi-
dent’s) Chevy. It was a new
car, too.”

For so many years the
trucks have kept people awake
at night, and torn up the
streets.

“It’s been a long time. The
hard part was just getting
someone to listen to us.”

High power coming soon?

Davidson radio station WDAV plans to go to high power

sometime during “the spring or early summer”’ according to

$70,000 is.the initial requirement needed to purchase the
necessary equipment to boost the station's power. The station
has applied for a federal grant which is currently under
ration.

WDA iss plans to launch a fund-raising drive after the first
of the year. Lovell stated that the station would contact
‘‘cultural, media, and educational leaders"’ in Statesville,
Mooresville, Concord and Salisbury for their advice as well as
financial support.

After the beginning of the year,
broadcasting on a high power schedule.

Lovell indicated that this will mean. ‘‘increasing classical,
verbal, and children’s. broadcasting.’’ He went on to add-that
future possibilities. include syndicated programming, such as
concert, series by major symphony orchestras, the taping of

faculty and student recitals, and the prodections of forums.

WDAV will begin

Fellows. adds new Trustees

The N:C. Fellows Program now has several ‘former Fellows
who have gone through their educational process and are now in
the position of serving as Trustees,” according to Professor of
Psychology and N.C. Fellows advisor John Kello.

In the past, the Trustees have been mainly local and regional
businessmen who have been involved principally in overseeing
and providing the budget. The addition of these new Trustees,
however, has given them the opportunity to work on
formulating some standard guidelines for the program.

Until the program has these new guidelines, Dr. Kello
stated that they have been asked to ‘‘hold off’ on admitting
upperclassmen. He went on to add however, that this year, for
the first time, transfer students are competing in the program.

In the future, if upperclassmen are allowed to join the
program, they will probably be selected by the same process as
the freshmen are with preference given to sophomores then
juniors.

This year, 72 freshmen submitted applications and are
currently going through screening interviews. On the basis of
their applications and evaluations by their interviewers, 24 will
be selected as finalists. These final 24 will spend the week-end of

Jan. 13-14 undergoing intensive interviews and around 10 will
be chosen as Fellows.
