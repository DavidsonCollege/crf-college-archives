On Student Faculty Relations

‘rom the discussion forwarded bythe
Y. M. C. A. sponsored student-faculty
relations open forum in Phi Hall the
other night, came the resulting decision
that the main cause for the present status
existing between faculty~and students
of Davidson is the attitude of the stu-
dent body (which attitude probably has
sprung up from tradition) of frowning
on all relations other than simple ‘‘ques-
tion-answer”” intercourse between fac-
ulty and students. i

Therefore, if the student body should
actually desire a better relation between
faculty and students (and we think the
relation could definitely be improved),
the simplest way to get this better rela-
tion is to start a movement which frowns
on the ‘‘smooching” utterances that auto-
matically emulate from onlookers when
a person lingers by the professor’s desk
after class.

“Don’t you think we can’t tell who’s
trying to impress-and-who’s really _inter-
ested in the thing discussed!” one pro-
fessor assured those attending the open
forum,

——hr thrs-editortat, we do not intend to
defend the “apple-shiners” nor do we
advocate their going unchecked. But,
after the admissions of several represen-
tative seniors, we conclude that the at-
titude and sounds are merely a joke and
should not prevent a person’s intellectual
curiosity from finding stimulation from
the professor’s desk. And yet, other
persons contend that they do not think
of stepping by the said desk for fear of
someone's misinterpreting their intellec-
tual curiosity as being ‘a sham for im-
pressing that"holder of the grade book.

The situation has actually become ser-
ious, and the only way toward better
faeulty-student relations is for-the-stu=
dent body to immediately frown-on the
persons who embarrass the after-class-
question man, or the Sunday night visi-
tor, and for the student body at large to
become after-class-question men and also
Sunday-night-callers.

We would like to continue the
present prices, but this can only be done with
the co-operation of all. The honor system is
working, very well—only recently we had a com-
plaint on it by the manager of the College Store

their own prices on cookies or who forget to pay.

The penny cakes have always been a point of
controversy. Managers for the past three years

in it.

And yet 43 per cent of the Senior Class did not
think it worth their while to attend. Fifty-six
(out of 128) members of the Senior Class figured
that they could save a few minutes time by using
one of their cuts on this extended chapel period

rather than one of the normal length.

If such co-operation is shown on a really worth-
while chapel program—how can you expect to
improve them?

Davidson on a stay of three and

two-thirds years.)

Recreation and Hallucination

second year at this noble institute
was ushered in
bythe war in

records, as Jan Savitt’s “720 in the

such killer-dillers as “People who
live in glass houses might just as
well answer the doorbell” in the
Strips ‘n’ F'l’a’n’k’s. We beat Duke
University 2-0 (in soccer), and the
column “Discords” in the Davidson-
ian tried to promote one of John
Kirby’s. new records which went

by the name of “In a Twentieth

Century Outhouse.” Dr. Chalmers
Davidson's library had a rush for
“The Grapes of Wrath,” and the
column,.GLEANINGS (The Filth
Column of that day) had this to
say: “Sam _ Spencer certainly de-
veloped into the Casanova—of--the
Campus, after having spent Friday
night at Converse with Scotty and
Saturday up at-W- €.”

Davidson's” first’ Interfraternity
Sing was held that year, and the
word, “Mishtown” adorned the
Southern Railway underpass in huge
white letters. As a result of al-
most a month of snow on tthe
ground after Christmas, there was
a great abundance of fresh air whiz:

look into some of the more serious

facts.

1. Rooming conditions: Where

there had been a be-cindered road

,arose James B. Duke Hall, home

of the idle rich of our little com-
munity. This magnificent  struc-
ture was opened to the public( and
students too) early in the year. Re-
plete with suites, easy chairs, and
sun-bathing terraces, this Country
Club raised the standard of living
at Davidson greatly. It was some-
thing new here to have musical floor
coverings and hot and cold water
out of the same faucet, together
with a total lack of electric wires
camaflouging the ceiling. We are
delighted to see that old Duke is
still with us, because everyone
thought that after the first heavy
rain she would go down like the
Titanic.

2. Social program: This was
opened in November
with the Homecoming celebration,
starring none other than Freddy
Johnson ¢and his orchestra, who
helped us beat The Citadel on that
occasion in a most dreary and cold
rain. In rapid succession came Bob—
Chester, playing for Midwinters,
Dean Hudson at the Military Ball,
and Johnny Long at Spring Frolics.
These were the dances. What about
the rest of the social program? Well,
there was a Converse Day, I be-
lieve; “which together with” a few
sociat fraternity and literary society
functions made up the rest of the
season. This seems to be one of
the major complaints of the stu-
dents—no well-balanced and nor-*
mal social program in which the
entire student body can take part.
When I think of ‘the thousands of
dollars that have been spent by the
students of this institution for trans-
portation between here and Char-
lotte, it makes my pocketbook cry
out in protest. But alas! “in ac-
cordance with the requirements of
the Trustees of the College, dancing
at Davidson is forbidden,’ In these

is not a suitable place to have the

about the smaller organizations?
