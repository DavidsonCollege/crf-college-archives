It. can undoubtedly be said

were the stormiest in this
paper's venerable life
Stitt’s sandals had

gotten wet last spring when a
guy named Goodykoontz began
a campaign for administrative

creativity on the Davidson
campus. The campaign was a
little too open, and all who read
this paper then know what hap

peat the story now would only
open old wounds,

But the story of Stitt, the man
in the middle of a cross-fire be

has never been told. Perhaps
he would prefer that it not be
told, but somehow it should be.

At times Stitt was berated, at

Stitt can also tell how he used

floor in Chambers where the in

“‘How’'s your father, Dave?"

a recommendation from the

After the storms of that

spring, which proved to be the
most hazardous of the seasons
for Stitt, he settled down to car
ry out a three-pronged program
to make THE DAVIDSONIAN
a better paper: print some six
page papers with highly inter

about things other. than the
drinking rule and compulsory
vespers; and brighten the gen

his goals. He put: out four six

achievement being the political

Wearing flapping sandals, David Stitt entered THE DAVIDSONIAN office last

Finally, in the news and fea
ture stories Stitt did obtain a
brighter outlook on Davidson
life. Yet he was not afraid to
run critical articles when they
were called for. His biggest
success was the series exposing
the gross unsanity in the col
lege cafeteria. For a_ time.
Slater had its house so untidy
that it lost its health rating. It
now has it back, an “A.”

If anything happened while
Stitt held down the editor's
desk, it was that he was criti
cized unjustly by certain mem
bers of the administration. For
instance, Chaplain Will Terry
was quite upset when this paper
ran a headline using the word
“‘atheist"’ over a story about the
fact that one of those animals
would appear alive and roaring
on God's little acre here.

And even the august and dedi
cated Board of Trustees took
time out from its deliberations
to notice Stitt’s little paper. The
group felt the paper's readers
lack adequate intelligence to
realize that the old masthead
“The News and Editorial Voice
of Davidson. College’’ does not
mean the administration or the
trustees use THE DAVIDSON
IAN for their official organ.

So the paper's old masthead
was retired. Stitt has now fol
lowed it, flapping the same old
sandals out of the office, But
he left behind positive accom
plishments that are making for
a better Davidson. And most
important of all, ‘he left a tradi
