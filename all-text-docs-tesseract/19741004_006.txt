Slum Clearing Requires Awareness

To the Editor:

- IT heartily commend THE

DAVIDSONIAN staff for
bringing the issue of poor
housing to the attention of the
community.

‘For the additional in-
formation of your readers,
here are some statistics taken
from the 1970 Census and
related material:

There were 685 total housing -
units in Davidson, with 51
lacking some or all plumbing;

Letter To The Editor

six with no water, ten with no
flush toilet, 34 with no bathtub

- or shower, ten without com-

plete kitchen facilities.
Of these 51 units, 30 were oc-
cupied by black families.
Additionally, in the Charlot-
te metropolitan ‘area in 1970,
there were 6875 families living
below the poverty level.

- Thenumber of housing units
in Mecklenburg County
classified ‘‘dilapidated with
plumbing”’ increased from

1219 in 1960 to 2622 in 1970. .

Now, the concerns of THE
DAVIDSONIAN staff are not
in fact just local issues ; pover-
ty will nof disappear once one
graduates from Davidson
College.

Here is an excellent exam-

ple of Davidson as microcosm, :

the haves and the have-nots,
the educated and_ the
uneducated, the upwardly
mobile and the immobile
(“They treats us real good’’).

Southern Bell Rates Imply
Ne Ultra Society Collusion

To the Editor:

Southern Bell Telephone
Company always has tried its
hardest to rip off the students
at Davidson College.

We pay $15 (plus additional
charges for such extra con-
veniences as longer cords) for
installation of a telephone that
is used for eight months, the
same price paid by a person
who has a phone installed per-
manently in his home.

‘Initial phone installation in
a home often includes the run-
ning of telephone wiring from
a telephone pole to the house
and to the phone location

..within the home. This type of
installation takes time and ~

probably is worth the in-
stallation fee charged.

However, to charge the
Davidson student the same $15
to connect two or three wires
in three minutes time in his
dorm room is extremely
unreasonable.

It seems that Southern Bell
would be satisfied with the
Davidson students! $15  in-
stallation fees plus extra ac-
cessory charges.

But, no, Southern Bell’s high
initial charges are only. sur-
passed by its poor service.

Three weeks after writing
Southern Bell to apply for a
phone and after making
several calls to Southern Bell
on its twenty cent pay phone,
my telephone finally was in-
stalled. However, the phone
installed was not the type of
phone ordered.

A table phone had been or-
dered, but a wall phone was
installed. Southern Bell
revealed to me that the college
had told the company to install
only wall phones in the dorm
rooms.

If the Davidson student is
going to pay the $15 in-
stallation fee to Southern Bell
when the. college offers no
phone program to the student,

_ it, is my opinion that the
student should have the type
of phone he or she wishes.

Having seen several table
phones in other dorm rooms
on campus, I decided to in-
vestigate the matter. ;

It seems that three years
ago Davidson College told
Southern Bell that it would
prefer that only. wall phones

be. installed in dorm rooms.

After locating the Davidson
administrator who-serves as
unofficial mediator between
the college and Southern Bell,
I was told by this ad-
ministrator that it would be
fine to have table phones in-
stalled in dorm rooms.

Southern Bell then said it
would put in the telephone I
originally ordered (an order
which is on their records), but
I would have to pay for the
reinstallment added on to the
$22 for the installation two
hours earlier of the wall phone
I did not even order. Thus the
grand total would be $36--$15
for the wall phone installation
plus $7 for a longer cord plus
$7 for the reinstallation plus $7
for a longer cord on the rein-

’ stalled phone.

According to Southern Bell,
if I had the phone taken out
that I did not even order, I
would still have to pay $22 for
no phone.

At most colleges, the phones
remain installed in the dorm
rooms all year, and the
student decides if he wants to
pay the local charge during
the school year.

However, at Davidson, the
phones are installed year after
year in the same dorm rooms
with the $15 installation fee
charged each year.

When I spoke with the ©

already mentioned Davidson
administrator and mediary
between the college and
Southern Bell, he said that he
would offer me no help and
that he completely agreed
with Southern Bell that I
should pay the total $36 to
get the phone I originally
ordered.

I checked into contributions
made to the college and
discovered, as I suspected,
that Southern Bell has made
large contributions to the
college during past years.

For example, last year
(1973-74), Southern Bell was a
member of the Ne Ultra
Society for giving over one
thousand dollars to the college
that year. Though the names
of the members ‘of. the Ne
Ultra Society are public in-
formation, the college would
not reveal the amount of the
Southern Bell contribution nor
any other contributions which
-I.-.was told the college con-
siders private information.

I’ve drawn my own con-
clusions. I’ll leave you to draw

yours.

The question I add to those
posed in your editorial has to
do with whether or not stu-
dents are and will be part of
the solution or part of the
problem.

Although students today do
not usually spend great sums
of money on button-down
shirts, alpaca sweaters, John
Romain pocketbooks, and
Weejuns as was the case only
a few years ago, the students’
overall standard of living now
seems to. include the
‘‘necessities’’ of telephone,
television, and one or two ex-
pensive stereo sets per room.

Is itrindeed possible for one
in rat and roach territory to
view the children of privilege
as friend or savior without
more evidence of austerity on
the part of students?

I am certain that the
average income of white
families in Davidson more
.than doubles that of black
families ; I am equally certain

that the amount of money
spent on “entertainment” by
the residents of one dormitory
during a single quarter would
be more than adequate to
begin a mortgage fund for a
low-income family. I make
these remarks neither to
defend the college ad-
ministration’s past record or
to accuse students of being
frivolous; I simply want to
suggest that-a radical change
in many corporate and in-
dividual values is needed if
life is to be made tolerably
humane, just and civilized in
this society.

Neither students nor ad-
ministration nor faculty nor
townspeople can assure the
eradication of squalor; but
any of these groups can im-
pede, even prevent, such an

effort. :
Forgive my preaching; but

don’t forget the pictures in last

week’s DAVIDSONIAN!

Minister to Students-

‘11 Harrowhouse,”’ like ‘Richard Jester’s
“Juggernaut,” is a case\of a director
working with a screenplay that he does not
care for.

I suspect that whatever good qualities Jef-
frey Bloom’s script for the former film ap-
pears to possess should be attributed to
Aram Avakian, who directed, and to Charles
Grodin, James Mason, Trevor Howard and
John Gielgud, who manage to bring their
roles to life.

One of the young directors allowed to in-

reel to reel reviews

“11 Harrowhouse”’

dulge themselves after the financial tri-_

umph of ‘‘Easy Rider,’”’ Avakian, a former
film editor, had his first feature, ‘“‘Exnd of the
Road,”’ released in 1970. ee)

The film, which I have not seen, created

something of a sensation among critics and ©

was generally accounted a pretentious but
promising mess. It was an abysmal failure
at the box office.

An interval of three and a half years
passed before Avakian was allowed to make
another film. ,

By then, he had learned his lesson. ‘‘Cops
and Robbers:’ is thoroughly mediocre ex-

‘cept for one memorable shot of suburban
life as viewed from above.

“11 Harrowhouse,”’ released a little over a
year after ‘‘Cops and Robbers,”’ is also
about a burglary; this time a diamond heist.
The new film is the more interesting of the
two, and I can begin to see why ‘‘End of the
Road”’ created such a stir. ;

Avakian has a directorial personality and
is able to express it. ‘11 Harrowhouse’’ is in-
fused with a cold, bizarre, not at all likeable
spirit, but an interesting one nonetheless.
Sexual roles are practically reversed in the
film, and the female romantic lead (Candice
ecg ‘carries on a lesbian affair on the
side.

' Instead of interpreting the screenplay
seriously, Aviakan makes a burlesque of it.
He seems to have had to virtually rewrite
the film, and the effect is a little like that of
‘‘What’s Up, Tiger Lily?” the Japanese spy
film thdt Woody Allen rewrote and dubbed
as a comedy.

Avakian is too intelligent to take -the
screenplay as given, and he is too

*

sophisticated and cynical to be interested in
making a traditional genre picture. For
him, he has chosen the best alternative.

He does not entirely manage to overcome
the obstacle of subject matter inappropriate
to his personality, but his effort is a valiant
one.

The film is beautifully decorated. The set |
designs and cinematography are excellent, —
and the costume designs pretty good.
Avakian’s direction is generally competent
and occasionally a good deal better than
that--as in.a shot of horses running down a
hill followed by the shadow of an advancing
cloud. J

Avakian’s main talent is as a director of
actors; his use of the camera tends to be a
little heavy-handed. Grodin, who receives a
screenplay credit for ‘‘adaptation,’’ seems
to have been encouraged to rewrite com-
pletely his part. He presents a droll charac-
terization of a nervous, awkward coward--a
fine travesty of our expectations for his role.
phe is mostly at a loss but is nice to look
at.

Avakian deftly exploits his leads as a
couple of silly sex objects and gives them
some delightfully vacuous bits of business to
perform. He is really more interested in
Mason, Howard and Gielgud, who not too
surprisingly steal the film.

These excellent actors have often proved
themselves capable’ of mediocre per-—
formances, but under Avakian’s firm
guidance, they give performances that
beautifully complement one another, that —
are perfectly molded for Avakian’s black
comic vision and that is each an exquisite
work of art in itself.

Like ‘‘Cops ‘and Robbers,’’ ‘11
Harrowhouse”’ has A MESSAGE. “Cops and
Robbers” celebrates thievery by cops while .
condemning the society which drives them
to crime. “11 Harrowhouse” condemns the
diamond industry, which is metaphysically
referred to as ‘‘the system,” for being cold
and inhuman.

The point would perhaps be more con-
vinecing if the film itself were not guilty of
the same vice. ©
