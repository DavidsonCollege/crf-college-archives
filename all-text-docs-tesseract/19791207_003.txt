Draft registration forum draws 200

By ROY FULLER
Staff Writer

Approximately 200 students
attended a forum on draft
registration Monday.

The forum, sponsored by
NC-PIRG, consisted of two
speeches in favor of reinstating
draft registration and two
speeches against.

Religion Professor Samuel
Maloney, the first speaker, felt
the real question is whether we
need registration, not whether
we want it. He gave several
reasons for his support of draft
registration.

First, Maloney noted that
experts feel that ‘there will be
little warning before the next
war. Registration would allow.
more immediate troops which
Maloney believes will be vital
for strength in conventional
warfare.

According to Maloney, the
deficiencies in the volunteer and
reserve armies are two more

reasons that registration should _

be reinstituted. Maloney said
he gives the volunteer army a
“C” grade since they have

lowered standards, and he poin- —

ted out the limited effectiveness
of the reserve forces.

strength of the Soviet Union,
Maloney stated, ‘‘the best
guard against war is strength,

not weakness.’’ Maloney: con-
cluded that since “the nature of
man is not inherently good,
“one should not idealistically
think: war will never happen.
Philosophy Professor Lance
Stell was the first to speak
against the reinstitution of
draft registration. From an
ethical viewpoint, Stell argued
that human beings have rights
which are moral restraints on
even those laws that men make.
Stell stated, ‘Compulsory ser-
vice is wrong... and all instan--
ces of it are illegitimate.”’
According to Stell, the draft
is not only immoral but uncon-
stitutional. He contended that
Congress cannot. force citizens
to'serve in the army because the
thirteenth amendment forbids
involuntary servitude. Stell ad-
ded that compulséry registra-
tion is also unconstitutional
because it violates fourteenth
amendment rights of equality
by discriminating by age and
sex. The draft’ discriminates

mally, a loss’ df libe

government to the people is to
protect the country from at-
tack.’’ He maintained draft
registration is necessary to
fulfill this obligation.

Like Maloney, Phelps sug-
gested that lack of manpower
and the declining quality of
present recruits are reasons why
draft registrtation is vital.
Phelps concluded that serving
in the military is the opportun-
ity for young Americans ‘‘to
pay back the debt for the liberty
that life has given to each of
us.” eon

The final speaker, Steve
Sumerford of the War Resisters’
League, said that the draft is
un-American. He said that his-

torically the United States has —

not favored conscription and
has had a volunteer army for
over four-fifths of its history.
»In closing, Sumerford said
draft registration is against the
basic American beliefs of li-
berty, justice, and peace.

After Sumerford's ‘speech, i

there was a question and

session. Becaiiée of the forum's
format,’ no. time was. le
