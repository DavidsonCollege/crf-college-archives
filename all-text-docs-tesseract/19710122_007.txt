The Davidson’ wrestling
team “suffered its first loss
on ‘Tuesday, when they were
outclassed by a superior
‘IN. C. State team.

The Wildcats scored a 32-
6 victory over Furman and
a 25-11 victory over UNCC,
both early in the season.
Davidson took four under-
feated wrestlers: Frank Ra-
der, Jack Jacobs, Greg
Funk, and Jim Purcell into
the meet with N. C. State,
one of the strongest wrestl-
ing schools in the state.

Few of the matches were
close, as State rolled to a

Close IMAC Race Predicted

By HOWARD BOYD

Sports Writer —.
With the start of the IMAC
basketball season, its time
for this fearless prognosti-
cator to climb back out on
the limb. Coming off of a
highly successful: flickerball
season (remember, I picked
the Delts to retain their
crown and a three way ‘fight
between the Sigs, Pikas, and
SPE’s for first in League B),
we look for another great

forecasting year.

In (League A, the crystal
ball says the Sigs are the
favorite, with the SAE's,
Betas and Indies likely to
battle for second, and per-
haps challenge if the Sigs
stumble. The _ defending
champion Pikas should have
little trouble in League, B,
and are odds-on choice to
retain their crown. Behind
them, the league is extreme-
ly well balanced, and any of
five or six teams could bat-
tle for playoff spots.

League A
The Sigs (7-5 in 11970) look
to be much _ improved

with all-IMAC Bob Niebauer
returning and the addition of
Frank Clark from last year’s
varsity. Regulars Bill Barn-
hill, and Bill McKenzie also
return, with sophomore ceén-
ter Greg Gerdy rounding
out the dine-up. Randy Park-
er and Pete Jorgenson are
strong reserves. This is a
good, solid ballclub with ex-
cellent shooting.

The SAE’s have all-IMAC
Bob Meadows and a lot: off
depth. Nick Livengood, Dave
Faison,. Steve. Batfle and
sophomore Bruce Baird will
probably start along with
Meadows, a good all-around
leader.
Dave Weaver and Ed Seiber
add bench :strentgh,
~ The Betas lost ‘‘do-it-all’’
John Baker, but sophomore
‘Randy fly may fill his
shoes. Another sophomore,
Kevin. Harkey supplies board
ower and, helps Ely - with
the scoring. Veterans Henry
Marrow and John Douglas,
plus sophomore Clayton Da-
ley started out the starting
five. Greg. Cameron, Jeff
Lynn “and Hi Lankanau lead

Armfield Cannon, .

the reserves. Given a few

breaks,—the-—_-Bétas___ could
threaten.
The Independents should

have. the strongest squad in
years. All-MAC Mike Miko-
layunas {is an outside gun-
ner, and Frank Soos,. Mike
O'Malley, John McCammon,
Harlan Day. and John Port-
er are all capable, experi-
enced performers. Mark
Baker and Tom Fondren add
depth. This could be a very
strong team if if can stay
together.

Cannon Il tas the sur-
prise team in flickerball and
could upset in basketball.
Calvin Allen, Rocky Bank-
ester and Steve Johnson are
tough inside and Steve Gates
and Dave. Ingold form a
good backcourt combo. Mack
Mitchell, Steve Rudell and
Chris Holly will also play.a
lot.

The Sig Eps are sopho-
more dominated and a ques-
tion mark. Larry Duncan,
Eddie Johnston and Bill
Alexander are the best of
the sophomores, with Wade
Shepherd, Dave Shepler and
Rob Hoy supply experience.
Larry Spears is the best re-
bounder. \

The Pi Kaps haope to end
losing ways with an influx
of a good crop of sophomores.
Pat Curley, Jim Thompson
and Clint.McCann form the
frontline, with Ron ‘Altman
and Sanford Steelman the
guards in the all sophomore
line-up. Phil Drake, Jimmy
Hunter and John Barbee are
top reserves.

East | is largely an un-
kown quantity, but if it. gets
organized may be a factor.
Tom McKenzie, Loren Clay,
Jim McNair, Owen Dickens
and Mitch Purvis are tikely
starters. Tony Martlit, Bob

Tsner and Phil Bishop will

play a lot also.

The Nus may be worst
team in the league. Kent
Beard is a good balliplayer,
but has. little help. Skip
Greathouse, Bob. Potter.
Gary ‘Long, Charlie Davis,
Jim Doss, and Jim  Stan-
field round out squad.

League B :

The. defending champion

Pikas return all-IMAC first

team: members Mark Affeldt -

and Floyd Strand, who are
almost a~ good team by
themselves, ‘But there's
more. =
Starters Gary Scibal and
Jack Ballenger return, but
sophomore Dennis Watson
has put the latter on the
bench. Sharpshooting John

Calhoun rounds out the
starting. five. Sophomores
Seaton Taylor and Dave

Stimpson are strong subs, as
the Pikas have the. best
bench in the league. They'll
have to play poorly to lose.

The Melts rate the nod
for a distant second, but are
much weaker than 1970's
runner-ups. Junior Greg
Sikes and Woody Montgom-
ery are rugged, and sopho-
mores Mike Deese, Andy
Davis and Bob Lewis can
play.

Hamp Whittington, Hugh
Gaither and Drew White
give the Delts a ‘good bench,
but loss of several stars to
the Indies keeps the Delts
from being a much: stronger
baliclub.

The Gamms have a good
starting five but Jack size
and depth. Charlie’ Parks
and sophomore John Willits
are the forwards, Jim Elli-
son at center, sophomore
Mike Tombari and steady
Scott Nicholson the guards.
Ed Dietrich and Robert Nor-
ris will play a lot.

The Machis have _ high-
scoring John Saunders, good
all-around play from Herb
Clegg and Jack Latimer, but
lack height and depth. Ho-
ward Boyd and either Adam
Robinson or Reif Kessler
are the other’ starters, with
Walt Walker, Jim Hudson
and Phil Dotts on bench.

The ATO’s are led by
playmaker Jim Montgom-
ery, big Bob Peele ‘inside
and sophomore scorre Mit-
chell Johnson. Veterans Mort
Chiles and Jim Hawkins
round out the starting five.
Ted Woods, Chipper Jones
and Eddie Bridges supply
bench strength.

Watts-Belk has a balanced
feam which should get bet-
ter as the season goes

along. Probable starters in-
clude Bill?) McIwain, Eldon
Basham, John Simms, Bob
Warnken and Dave Dug-
gins. Frank Folger, Bill
Higgins and David. Daniels
will see plenty of action.

You
KA's the Williamses. All-
IMAC Steve, Lou, and sop-
homore Wary] all _ start,
along with Charlie Terrell
and Jim Roy. Both Steve
and ‘Lou are prolific scorers,
but may not get enough sup-
ports to better last year's
3-9 record. Seniors Jim Crou-
se and Bob Truit and sop-
homores Bob Solberg and
Elliot Savage back up the
first five,

Paul Brown, Larry Gra-
ham, Bill Sims, Ted Ellet
and Mike Reed are proba-
ble starters for East -Il.
Mike, Allport, John Webel,
Dave Kittrell and Mike Mc-
Farland are some
who will see action.

For Cannon I, George Poe,
Andy McLawhorn and Char-
lie Slagle form a. strong 1-
2-3. punch. Edgar Weir and
Dave Bender may.also start,
with Doug Berry, ‘Walt
Walker, and Steve Earp in
reserve.

Cat Grapplers

i.

36-0 victory. The Wolfpack's

effort included several pins
and a 13-2 victory by Steve
Rhode, the outstanding
wrestler in the ACC a year
ago.

Coach Charles Parker re-
mained optimistic ‘'We have
a good wrestling team, but
we just weren't ready for.
what happened last night
(Tuesday). We wrestled bad-
ly, and I hope we don't
wrestle like that again."

The next meet. for the
Wildcats is Jan: 29 at VMI,
in what should be a close’
contest. VMI has a_ good
team, but according to Park-
er, “Nothing like N. C.,
State.’

Physically, the ‘Cats will
be nearly back to full
strength with the return of
Ronnie Williams, who had
been suffering from mono-.
nucleosis, however, the team
also. received some bad
news. _

Rob Benton, who had been
counted on early in the sea-
son in the 126 pound class
will probably miss the rest
of the season due to a dis-
located elbow which has
not been showing much im;
provement since he sustain-

ed the injury early in De- ,
