The DAVIDSONIAN, January 29, 1919

HOT RACE FOR VARSITY
MEN BEING STAGED

(Continued from page 1)

mond brothers, none of whom play a
slow game. There is a chance that
“Stringbeans” McAskill will be shifted
to center. If this does happen, Cun-
ningham, who played a remarkably con-
sistent game at center for the Seniors
during the class games, looks to be the
most promising candidate for that posi-
tion. “Fresh” Cornelson, however, with
more practice may push him hard for the
place. ‘The fight for the guard positions
will be a battle royal. 1f McAskill does
not play center, he will of course play
one of the defensive positions. Sclienck,
who showed up to a great advantage last
year, will find quite a few to contend
with this year. McAlister and Brice play
a wonderful close guarding game. On
the other hand; the other guard candi-
dates, A. R. Craig, Chalmers, Woods
and Doubles, play more of a floor game
and shoot with accuracy.

All the candidates realize the fact that
the first game ts near at hand and ate-
cordingly, “pep” and plenty of fight
around in the Gym these nights, as the
race for the coveted “D” proceeds.

“WORLDLY PLEASURES”
AND FRIDAY NIGHT

A very interesting program was car-
ried out at the Ministerial Band Sun-
day afternoon, ‘The general topic for
discussion was “Worldly -Pleasures.”

Dwight Chalmers was the first man
to speak. He gave a very interesting and
instructive talk on dancing. On the
dance floor as in other ways of recre-
ation the character of a man is exhibited.
“A man does what he docs because he is
what he is.”

McCloy was the second speaker. His
topic was Sabbath Observance. He
brought out three main points, First,
there is a blessing for thuse who keep the
Sabbath; second, laws in respect to Sab-
bath keeping have been repeatedly given;
third, those who do not keep the Sab-
both will be punished. The Sabbath has
not been kept as it should. From every
viewpoint it is absolutely essential to
Christianity that the Sabbath should be
kept.

Owing to the fact that a large num-
ber. of ministerial candidates have Sun-
day Schools on Sunday afternoons, it
was decided best to hold the Band meet-
ings on Friday nights immediately after
supper.

VARIETY PROGRAM
IN D.C. MOVIES

The “Y¥" movies Tuesday night were
a decided success from all standpoints.
Not only were the reels themselves good,
but they were run thru almost without
mishap. With a few more nights’ prac-
tice, we believe, our operators will be as
good as any to be found.

The. first. reel presented Wm. §. Hart
in “Vhe Hidden Trail,” the story of
how a man’s wife hélped him to come
back. This was followed by an educa-
tional film which showed something of
the way in which army cooks are trained.

The real hit of the evening, however,
was scored when Mae Marsh’s name
and face appeared on the screen in “The
Little Tease.” The show ended with
“Green Eyes and Bullets,” which turn-
ed out to be a veritable “Comedy of Er-
rors,” full of laughs and funny situ-
ations.

Visitor in Asylum—Who is that intel-
ligent-looking giant .in the padded cell?

Attendant—A newspaper editor. He
worried himself crazy by imagining the
Peace Conference would end before the
ball season opened, and that, in the in-
terval, he wouldn’t be able to find
enough news to fill his paper.—Life.

The Davidsonia has been interested in
maintaining contact with the Davidson
boys in the camps “over here’? and “over
there.” It is glad to be able to publish
this week a letter from Corp. W. C.
Neel, ex-'19, to his old roommate C. N.
Morrison, 21. Neel was in college last
year when his draft number was called.
His present address is Hy. Dept. 306
Engrs., A. E. F., Aisel-sur-seine, France.

His letter is, in part: “We have gone
through the various maneuvers with
pretty good account of ourselves. Mov-
ing has taken up the greater part of our
time, We came thru Kagland landing
at Liverpool and traveling by — train
across to Winchester. “Then went across
the channel to Cherborough. After one
month's training in the cehtral part of
France, we were taken to a light sector
of the front, Vosages, around St. Die;
then back fortwo wweeks’ training, then
a move to the front around Verdun.
Here some real fighting was going on,
when the armistice was signed. “Then
some real celebrating took place, espe-
cially among the French—"‘finish la
querre” could be heard all around. Fite-
works were set off all through the day
and night. Phen came the real test.
130-mile hike with rifle. belt of ammuni-
tion, and full pack. We started No-
vember 19 and ended up December 3.
I was then sent away to a gas school for
one week. Now | am back with the
company and we start drill tomorrow,

“While at the front Edgerton, ‘21,
surprised me by happening along one
day. He is with the ammunition train
and was driving a truck loaded with
bombs. He told me L. P. Good was
company clerk in his company. I haven't
seen many D, C. men while over here.
We do not get much opportunity of see-
ing men outside our regiment, because
each regiment is billeted separate. This
life is pretty monotonous now since all
the excitement is over, but we do not
know just when we will get a boat for

the old . S. A.”
