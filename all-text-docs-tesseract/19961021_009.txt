THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS.

Bored? Start Your
Own Holy War

Youknow, something I’ ve no-
ticed this year is that there has been
acomplete lack of religious debate
and tension on campus. This is out
of the ordinary for Davidson, and I
don’t know whether it shows that
we’ ve all grown up a little bit over
the summer or if other things

the Bible more often, you wouldn’t
be so confused. The conversation
will probably end with him/her
asking you, Do you know Jesus
Christ as your personal Lord and
Savior?”

An atheist will get hopping

people suck.”

A cat lover will accuse you of
species discrimination and say that
you should be taken out back and
shot. Furthermore, s/he may refer
you to the TAAAAA (The Inter-

national Journal of Attitudes About’

Anthropology, Archaeology,

seem more important than re-
ligious debates that are irrel-
evant to everyone who isn’t
involved in them.

Although this is probably
a sign of a healthy campus,
I’m sure that many of you are
bored and disturbed by it.\ If
you are, why not start some
religious tension of yourown?

The conversation will
probably end with him/her
asking you, Do you know
Jesus Christ as your per-
sonal Lord and Savior?”

and Anthropomorphism), a
magazine that, although ob-
scure to the point of not being
findable in any database any-
where, s/he swears is a seri-
ous academic publication and
recently published an article
which revealed that Enilef is
an ancient Mesopotamian
word for Sovereign Lord of

Here’s a good way to do it:
Go around saying, “God is dog
spelled backwards.”

Now, this phrase is silly,
childish, mindless, and almost ut-
terly devoid of meaning, but that
has never stopped anyone from
arguing vehemently about “issues”
before. Ask anyone who kept up
with the “Evolution happened/No
it didn’ t/Yes it did/No it didn’ t/Ad
nauseam” debate in The
Davidsonianacouple of years ago.

Although simple, this will
most likely have an interesting ef-
fect on the people you know.

A fundamentalist will take a
good look at the information, ex-
amine the evidence, and tell you
that it’s offensive and that s/he just
doesn’t buy it. S/he will further-
more tell you that if you only read

mad and tell you that you have no
right to say this to him/her since no
one has the right to impose his/her
religious beliefs on anyone else.

Anagnostic will discuss it with
you for a while and show interest,
but eventually s/he won’t be able
to decide his/her opinion on the
matter.

A stoner (Of course, we all
know that no one at Davidson uses
drugs, don’t we?) will gaze deeply
into space for a few minutes and
realize that s/he must investigate
the matter more. S/he may then go
to the mountains, eat a bunch of
shrooms, and stare at a picture of
Benji (a.k.a. The Heavenly Dog)
until s/he can apprehend a deep,
universal Truth on the order of
“All you need is love” or “Mean

the Universe.

Finally, many people here will
smileand say,“Yeah.Wanna beer?”
This is the healthiest response pos-
sible, and if you anticipate hearing

it from someone, make sure that «= -

you have finished all of your home-
work before approaching him/her
with the phrase. Trust me, there is
such a thing as having too much
fun on a school night.

With this information in mind,
you can be mature and try to enjoy
the peace that we’re experiencing
right now, or you can go out of
your way to start up a religious
debate, which will surely make
like-minded people respect you and
make everyone else think you’re
an ass.

Now you know, and knowing
is half the battle.

This week, when the 3.2
Davidson Football Team made
its way up to play Methodist Col-
lege, one very important aspect of
the team was missing: the Cheer-
leaders. In intercollegiate com-
petition, no team better exempli-
fies school spirit and the part of
athletic competition a school
wants to displayed than the
cheerleading squad. It is a won-
derful feeling for players to know
that the cheerleaders will be there
showing their support no matter
how the game is going. Espe-
cially when we play.on the road
and few Davidson fans are able to
attend, it makes a big difference
to have constant support on the
sideline. Through the good sea-
sons and the bad, the cheerleaders
are always there supporting us. I
know I speak for my teammates
in saying, “we appreciate the
cheerleaders.”

All that being said, Davidson
has initiated a new policy this
year. The cheerleaders can no
longer goto away football games.
The reason for this decision is that
it was considered inequitable for
the cheerleaders to accompany
the men’s football team to away
games when there is no compa-
rable women’s team. It is not a
question of money. The cheer-
leaders had the money to make
the trips. It is not a question of
desire. The reason these Davidson
students take the time to practice
and learn how to cheer is because
they want to show their support.
They all want to goto away games.
Many. of them have told us how
sorry and upset they are at no
longer being allowed to go. So
there are no practical reasons for
this action. There are only politi-

cally correct ones.

Nothing is gained by de-
priving the football team of the
cheerleaders’ support on away
trips. But as is often the case
when using P.C. logic, that
doesn’t matter. The question of
what is best for Davidson athlet-
ics was also never addressed. The
rational used is simply, “If Ican’t
have it (or if everyone can’t have
it), I won’t let you have it.” It is .
somewhatironic that such achild-
ish and selfish rational has come
to be espoused by an institution
of “higher learning” which is sup-
posed to teach us to think ratio-
nally and compassionately. The
fact that the cheerleaders went to
away football games did not hurt }
anybody. All it did was help the
football team. Taking away the
cheerleaders does not help any-
body. All it does is hurt the foot-
ball team.

Ihave always been proud to
say I’m a Wildcat. But now I
cannot help but feel some embar-
rassment in the fact that Davidson
was not able to avoid succumb-
ing to a legalistic and counter-
productive interpretation of poli-
cies and rules (after all, most
schools—including our oppo-
nents—take their cheerleaders to
away games). Although I sup-
port the intent of Title IX and
Davidson’ s efforts to bring about
parity in men’s and women’s
sports, I fail to see how depriving
the football team of the support
of the cheerleading squad (which
consists of men and women) fur-
thers this worthy goal.

To the cheerleaders, thank
you for your support and dedica- |
tion. The entire team will miss
you this week.

After reading Liz Reid’s re-
action to my article on “Skinny
Girls,” I’ll admit that I suffered
moment of self-doubt—then I re-
membered that] was right. Reid’s
approach to critical writing is an
interesting one, a combination of
emotional blindness and intimate
attack, but I think that I can ad-
dress her arguments despite their
lack of substance.

First, rest easy. The detailed
image of my furious note-taking
may remain a resident of Reid’s
imagination. I take mental notes.

Reid’s claim that the play
wasn’t “big on entertainment

interspersed with jokes and amus-
ing. parodies” seems a tad para-
doxical.. Remember all those
amusing parodies?” That was the
entertaining part. The director
makes choices as to how these
scenes are presented and:whether
the audience’s reaction (namely
laughter) was intended, it’ hap-
pened. Deal.

Though the play dealt with
diseases such as anorexia and bu-,
limia, I made a conscious | choice

to critique the production, not the
issues on display.

__ Reid assures us that the ac-
tors could have been “‘naked stand-
ing in the middle of a field” and
that I was wasting my time de-
scribing the “logistics of the set,”
but I hasten to disagree. Every-
thing you see while viewing a
play is a result of careful consid-

craft. Rather than dismiss the

show (it was a senior project), I
elected (and would again) to ana-
lyze the elements of theater as
they appeared to me. Look to the
News section for issues.

My lack of compassion was
not a result of inhuman apathy,
but an honest reaction to what I
saw on stage. Obviously, Liz
Reid had a very different experi-
ence, one that led her:to defend
something that didn’t need
defending—the play’s realistic
portrayal of eating disorders.

For the last time

I’m writing in response Saad
and Fahd Gul’s scathing articles in
the September 30th issue of The
Davidsonian. 1’ 11 make this article

brief since I’m sure this subject has

dominated the Opinions sec-

one of Benazir Bhutto’s cousins
and one of mine). She visits jails
and counsels rape victims. She
stated clearly that she has spoken
with women who have been jailed

stigma—anywhere in the world,
and [hate to say this, but especially
in Islamic countries.

The second issue I’d like to
discuss concerns Pakistan’s jails.
Saad and Fahd point out that

tion for long enough.

My original article was
trying to point out to
Davidson students that
women’s issues are not just
imaginary problems created
to help women express
sexual frustration. I’m sad
that somehow my point was
lost.

First, I’m going to ad-

Women’s issues are
not just imaginary
problems created to
help women express
sexual frustration.

jails are single sex. This
fact, however, does not pre-
clude the possibility of
guards raping female in-
mates.

Bhutto has been trying re-
cently to protect women
from this phenomenon but
has made little headway.

’ In general, a women’s jail
is in a building which is en-

dress the issue of whether
women in Pakistan are jailed for
zina, which, in effect, often in-
cludes rape. I recently spoke to
Selma Ismail, one of the women
active in the All Pakistan Women’s
Association. (She is incidently also

after having been raped. Perhaps
Fahd and Saad have not been made
aware of what really happens to
women in Pakistan. Rape is not
openly discussed, and is under-
reported for it carries a huge

closed in another, larger
men’s jail.

In order to get in and out of the
women’s prison, a person needs to
walk through the man’s prison. In
reality, plenty of men have access
to these female prisoners.
