Spencer Speech Reveals

Convocation at Davidson is
traditionally a time to pat our-
selves on the back. We trot out a
few distinguished guests and
alumni, present degrees and
awards, and listen to some
message of goodwill.

In an attempt to make up for
the shortcomings of Dr. Jim
Martin at last Spring’s Con-
vocation, President Spencer
spoke about the very crucial
issues of ‘‘The Year in

It is important first to con-
sider his audience. Faculty, ad-
ministration, alumni, parents,
friends and students. We can
only assume his remarks were
directed at one or more of these
groups.

Dr. Spencer spoke in ordinary
fashion, referring at times to
“all of us” and to the “en-
terprises in which we are all
engaged.”’

His designs are clear, to
make some suggestions about
the year we will spend together.

At the start he tells us that he
will comment on three matters
in progress. I will try to treat
those matters here in roughly
the same manner that Dr. Spen-
cer did. Perhaps if there are
any threads to his thinking we
can see how they weave
together.

The first matter is
coeducation. Since this is the
first year of full-scale

operation, some remarks over
this area might have been help-
ful.

He says, ‘‘I have said many
many times that we did not go
coeducational for the con-
venience or pleasure of our men
students.”

If he actually has said this
many times, and we assume for
now that he is telling the truth, I
wonder in what context this
comment arose.

The very notion that
coeducation was designed for
the convenience or pleasure of
‘men students is highly of-
fensive. Who would make such
aclaim?

If it were one of the more
callous friends, faculty, alumni
or parents, Dr. Spencer would
hardly throw this in the faces of
the other members of the group
because of the risks involved.

specific. ‘I have told
faculty) many times that they
are mistaken. We did not go
coeducational for the con-

venience or pleasure of our men
students.’’

The faculty, or any other of
the groups involved, would ap-
pear quite foolish, and Dr. Spen-
cer would have a war on his
hands.

If he really has said this many
times, there are only two
possibilities. Either he is given
to talking to himself in a
rhetorical fashion, or some
other real persons proposed the
idea that he wishes to correct.

But the only other group in his
audience was students. Now
perhaps many individual
students have thanked Dr.
Spencer for making Davidson
coeducational, presuming that
this will enhance their con-
venience or pleasure.

However, I hardly think this
is the case. I remember very
clearly what Davidson was like
prior to coeducation. Of all the
arguments students offered
then, and there were several
hundred, I never’ heard
hedonism offered as the basis
for coeducation.

Perhaps Dr. Spencer means
students collectively, or
“students as students’ as he
calls them. He may believe the
desires for pleasure and con-
venience to be a part of every
student. And this may not be
far from the mark.

But if students are so con-
cerned with their immediate
pleasure and convenience, how
does one explain Wildcat foot-
ball, or rugby or wrestling or
even the academic disciplines.
Such rigorous activities are
seldom of immediate pleasure
or convenience. How then, are
they sustained?

If Dr. Spencer means that
male students as a group sup-
ported coeducation solely for
pleasure or convenience, then
clearly he is wrong.

Moreover he is indulging in a
curious form of sexual
discrimination against males,
and we have good grounds to
take offense at his remarks.

Dr. Spencer closes by saying :
“I hope the novelty of their
being here will soon wear off,
and that we will all begin to
think of students, both men and
women, simply as students.”’
But what does it mean to think
of students as ‘‘students.”’

Literally, it has no force. It is

the same as saying, ‘‘we think
of men as men.’ It tells us
nothing about how to think of
students, or what students are.

Only by giving some ad-
ditional terms can we clear the
air. I would suggest that we
sympathetically think of others,
and especially of students, as
‘“*chuman beings.”’

Additional options are for
thinking of students as
‘“‘animals’’, ‘‘sources of in-
come”’, ‘‘alpha-numbers” and
the like.

If there is some commonly
shared notion of ‘‘students as
students”, then Dr. Spencer
should put it forth. If it is this
notion, however, that creates
predicaments similar to the
“pleasure and convenience’’ of
coeducation, then Dr. Spencer
should change his way of

thinking.

The President then moves to
matters of campus governance.
In one breath he says he will not
present any plan whose major
thrust the faculty opposes.

In the next breath, though, he
notes his personal support of the
college assembly, a plan which
the faculty has vigorously op-
posed for two years.

Both students and faculty
value candor and honesty. One
thing neither group tolerates,
though is the practice of
speaking out of both sides of
one’s mouth. The Davidson
community will not sit still for
shenanigans of this sort.

I have only a little space left,
so I will pass over the third
major area, that of Christian
committment, in order to look
at a smaller, but still crucial
area.

1973 is the year of financial
pinch. Davidson did very well,
though, operating well within
its budget with increased in-
come from outside sources.

In looking ahead, though, Dr.
Spencer tells us that ‘‘with no
increase in tuition and no in-
crease in enrollment, the two
most obvious sources of income
are automatically cut off.”

Look at whom he picks as the
most obvious sources of ad-
ditional income. Students.
Through increased numbers
and tuition. This is not as it
should be.

Dr. Spencer disagrees at this
point with Vice-President for

C.David Cornell, who publicly
terms large gifts such as those
by the Foundation as
the “‘life blood’’ of the College.

It is equally obvious that ad-
ditional income flows from
capital and annual gifts. There
is no clear reason to pick the
parents’ pocketbook.

The results of this speech will
be long in developing. It is
wrong to think that Dr. Spencer
represents any other viewpoint
than his own. His own thoughts,
though, are difficult to follow.

He takes a stand clearly at od-
ds with that of his faculty, while
saying this is not what he will
do. He tells us to think of studen-
ts as students without any in-
dication of just what they might
be. And it seems he has heard
some unpleasant things about
coeducation that he wishes to
dispell.

Some people try to find a
grand scheme for Davidson in
this speech. Some areas are
well thought out and clearly
stated. As President, Dr. Spen-

cer has the responsibility to
suggest policy for Davidson.
Our responsibility is to
seriously consider what he has
said.

At times he makes promises,
especially in regard to gover-
nance, athletics and salaries,
that he will have difficulty
making stick.

I am discouraged that Dr.
Spencer gives us so little sound
material to work with. But I
believe,, as Hemingway said,
that we must get our work done.

As Todd Eades observed in
this space last week, David-
son’s essential process is ad-
vocacy and compromise. I fear,
though, that Dr. Spencer’s
message will cause bad-
feelings for some time to come.

Perhaps the suggestions he
presents can serve as the first
grist in Davidson's great mill of
compromise.

Grinding it up and sifting
through the results will take all
of this year and a few more. It
will be interesting to see the
finished product.

FACULTY GUEST COLUMN

Davidson YM-YWCA
A Testimony and Plea

By DANIEL D. RHODES
Professor of Religion

For the past two years it has been my responsibility and my

privileae to serve as a faculty advisor to the ‘““Y”’ cabinet. In an in-

‘ormal way I would like to share with you what I have learned
about the functions and hopes of this student organization.

Over the years more than a third of Davidson’s students have
participated actively in the varied programs aided or sponsored by
the ‘‘Y’’. One of the most r and rewarding sevices has been
the STEP tutorial activity. Each year about seventy-tive students
have aided a like number of community children on a one-to-one
basis who have needed companionship and academic assistance. __

In like manner the ‘“‘Y”’ has helped to provide student manpower
(and woman power) for ongoing community ventures sponsored by
other organizations, e.g. scouting and the North Mecklenburg YM-
CA. In such a spirit of cooperation the ‘“Y’’ has recently published a
handbook available to all students outlining the oportunities for
volunteer service in Mecklenburg County.

Last year the most dramatic activity of the ‘““Y” was to get the
railway depot renovated for community use. Even without an
overall policy and program for the depot, community children en-
joyed square dancing, movies, crafts and meetings. For the most

activity, swimming, the groups would meet at the depot
going to the pool and return there after the outing.

This fall a committee involving all of the community
has begun work on policy and program for the depot. This will en-
sure the finest use of the facility.

Last spring, because of student requests, the “‘Y” sponsored
weekly worship services at the College Union. Ordinarily, however,
the “Y” keeps in touch with the various religious groups that
flourish on campus and renders whatever assistance it can.

In like fashion the ““Y”’ aided financially and otherwise in presen-
ting last year’s symposium on penology. It will continue to
cooperate with such ventures in the future.

This year should be a bright one for the ‘““Y”’. Rush Otey, the new
minister to students, has agreed to serve as a co-advisor to the
cabinet. He had already gone to work. Without any doubt his en-
thusiasm, organizational ability, and new ideas will strengthen
enlarge and focus the overall program of the “Y”’. We are glad that
Rush, Lilith, and Benjamin are in our midst.

I think you can feel my enthusiasm for the ‘‘Y”’ and what it seeks
to do. But with the members of the cabinet, I find working with the
‘“‘y”’ a frustrating thing. There is seldom enough volunteer student
personne] to render the services or carry out the programs that are
needed. Thus, on occasion, requests for assistance cannot be
honored or a few students find themselves more time than
they can afford. Right now there are requests for students to help in
the day care center and in youth groups of nearby churches. Won't
you get involved?

The additional point of frustration is our lack of money. Last year
we went “all out’’ to renovate the depot. It cost $16,000. Ap-
proximately $11,000 has been paid; but we still owe $5,000. Many
aspects of our program cost some money. And we are trying to help
one student through college.

The “Y" operates entirely on voluntary contributions. Have you
