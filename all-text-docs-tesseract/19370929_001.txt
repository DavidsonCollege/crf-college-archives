ROTC Work Of
Highest | Order

J. L. Ballard Praises Cadets at
Fort McClelland

a

“The work was of the very, very
highest order.” said Major J. L.
Ballard, of the local ROTC post.
with reference to the, showing of
the Davidson cadets encamped at
Fort~MceClelland. Ala, for six
weeks during the past summer.

Major Ballard also said that none
ofthe cadets returned with de-
merits, but all of them showed some
merit — some higher than others.
Major Ballard accompanied 37 men
from the local post to the camp.

Although scattered in different
parts of the camp battalion for the
major portion of the drill work
the Davidson group reunited to take
third place in the competitive pla-
toon drill.

The cadets received training in
six different types of guns, from
the three-inch trench mortar and

“the thirty-seven millimeter gun to

the automatic rifle, service rifle,
pistol and machine gun. Four men
of the local unit qualified as sharp-
shooters and fifteen as marksmen.

In athletics, Jim Wilson brought
away first prize for the individual
equipment race. Howard McFad-
yen, heavyweight wrestler, took a
shot at heavyweight boxing but
was eliminated after the second
round of tourney. The Davidson
representatives placed second in the
wall scaling event.

hands of the secretary of the state
committee not later than Novem-
ber 6, 1937. Mr. C, C. Walker, Wa-
chovia Bank & Trust Co., Winston-
Salem, is the secretary for North

secret of success in the great game

The competition is organized by
districts. containing six states each.
Each state committee nominates
two candidates to appear before’

to represent their states at Oxford.

The qualities which Rhodes spe-
cified in his will as forming the
basis of selection are: (1) literary
and_ scholastic ability and attain-
ments; (2) quajlitices of manhood,
to duty,
sympathy, kindliness, unselfishness,
and fellowship; (3) force of char-
acter, and instinct to lead; (4) phy-
sical vigor.

Some definite quality of distinc-
tion, whether in’ intellect, charac-
ter, or personality, or in any com-
bination of them, is the most im-
portant requirement for a Rhodes
scholarship.
