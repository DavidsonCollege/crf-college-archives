Development Moves Forward
On McConnell Pond Property

By Tom Koonce

After ideas were presented’

from three different companies, a
groupof interested faculty and staff
members decided on the land plan
to be used for the future develop-
ment on the McConnell Property.

This development will be on
the 98-acre property that begins
after the last house on the left as
you leave on Concord Road. This
property will contain a total of 198
lots to be divided equally between
Davidson faculty and staff hous-
ing and public housing.

‘The plan to be used for this
development is one that preserves
the community feeling of the town

of Davidson. The planned houses
will vary in size and shape and will
be fairly close together. Vice Presi-
dent for Business and Finance Bob
Sutton said, “The intent is to make
it fit in with the existing feeling of
the town.”

Suttoncommented on how this
plan was successful in avoiding a
normal suburban look where all
houses are architecturally the same.
The plan includes 12,970 feet of
streets that are lined by sidewalks
on each side with trees in between
the streets and the sidewalks.

The plan also shows six parks
in the development. These in-
clude a central football field-size

‘village green’ park anda park that

surrounds a pond on the property.
Sutton said that no property lines
would extend down to this three-
acre pond.

Sutton also said that there will
be no houses on Concord Road.
He said that a landscaping ease-
ment will be used to separate the
development from Concord Road.

The design is a result of feed-
back from companies along with
determining cost estimates from
different plans. These ideas along
with faculty and staff feedback
eventually evolved into this plan

Forum Addresses Student

By Walter Price

On Tuesday October 8, The
Student Government Association
sponsored a forum to discuss po-
tential reforms inthe honor system
at Davidson. Led by a six member
student panel, approximately 60
students came to Chambers Gal-
lery to voice their support of and
concerns with the current process.

As aresult of student interest
in this issue, SGA President Cam-
mie Covington discussed the pos-
sibility of a campus-wide referen-
dum ‘on changes in the system.
“Now it will be up to the Student
Conduct Council to look at the
issue and determine whether
changes in the system are feasible,”
Covington said. Covington said
that in order fora referendum to be
passed, two-third’s of the student
body must participate and requires

a two-third’s majority to pass.
The forum began with open-
ing statements from the panel
members concerning their views
of the present honor system, .The

panel was Comprised of: Anthony

Foxx, former honor council mem-
ber, John Howell, chair of the honor
council, Mimi Plauche, student
solicitor for the honor council,
David Thompson, editor of The
Davidsonian, Sally Stone, sopho-
more, and Craig Wall, SGA repre-
sentative for Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon.

Thompson opened the discus-
sion with a proposal to change the
present system of honor council
members hearing cases to a jury
system that would require the par-
ticipation of the entire student
body. Thompson noted that this
system would serve to facilitate

more fair trials while involving
more students directly in the honor
system.

Additionally, Thompson felt
that the j jury system wouldcircum-

‘Went a potential hazard in the pres-

ent system. “A close examination
of the system shows that there is
too much power in the hands of a
limited group,” Thompson said.
According to Thompson, this can
subject the system to the mercy of
achair or secretary. As the system
works now, Thompson said, good
faith is the only limitation of the
honor council chair manipulating a
jury orasecretary “packing ajury”.

Stone followed Thompson,
echoing his sentiments for the
advent of a student jury system.
Stone felt that every “student is a

Two ASU Students Advocate
The Legalization of Drug Use

By Ross Sloop

Last week the College Union
hosted Johnathan Walker and Jay
Neal as the guest lecturers for the
Thursday 4:00 forum. The two
Appalachian State University stu-
dents advocated the legalization of
all drugs.

From a moral standpoint
Walker cited man’s freedom as an
importantreason why drugs should
be made legal. He believes that it
is not the government’s place to
define and enforce the morality of
drugs.

He further claimed that the
government should not be able to
decide what activities are safe or
overly dangerous. Walker pro-
posed the theory that if the govern-
ment will not allow people to use
certain drugs because they are
dangerous, then they should pro-

-hibit people from driving in rush-

hour traffic since it too can often
be life-threatening.

Walker then pointed out that
much of today’s inner-city crime
and violence is due to the pushing
ofillegal drugs. Through legaliza-
tion, the black market would be
eliminated and, with it, many of
today’s drug related murders.

Crack is a highly potent form
of cocaine and one of the most
deadly drugs around. By adding
foreign substances to cocaine, the
drug becomes much more addic-
tive and much more dangerous,
Walker observed that if cocaine
were legal crack would never
havebeen created. By legalizing
drugs, the government could con-
trol the potency of substances as
well as purify the drugs of danger-
ousadditives.

Walker went on to cite the
therapeutic effects of drugs such as
marijuana. Doctors have found
that marijuanacan stopa full-blown
asthma attack, and it is also useful
against glaucoma, arthritis and
rheumatism. Marijuana can also
serve as an effective sleeping aid
