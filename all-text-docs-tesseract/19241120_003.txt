Roland Parker's bedtime story for kin-
dergarten boys:

One time there was a salesman who
knocked at a lady’s front door. Before
the lady could answer his knock the fam-
ily bulldog began chasing the salesman
around the house. When the poor fel-
low had made his third trip around, the
lady came to the door, and said, “Is
there anything I can do for you?” To
which the salesmn replied, “Yes, ma’am,
please open that gate while I make one
more trip around this house.” Story for
tomorrow night: “Charley and the little
grey wildcat.”

Lady (in department store)—“Have
you any invisible hair nets?”

Clerk—“Yes, ma’am.”

Lady—“Please let me see one.”

fellow, “Wildcat” that- they yelled so

The following letter was reecived by
this column last week :

Dear Mr. Busch: Why is it that men
like Mr. Kenneth Bell have such win-
ning ways with women? Please tell me
how I can acquire that personality. |

envelope, and repeat your question.
There once was a shieker called Abie,
He once had a date with his baby, |
He showed her the ring, |
And felt like a king; |
She thought for a while and said maybe.
Dear Chester:

I have watched with interest the won-
derful things that are happening to you
in Austrialia, and 1 notice that you are
going to bring back presents to the boys
and girls who write the nicest letters to
you. And, since my time is not taken up
with anything else. I thought F would |
write you. :

I attended Davidson College. That |
T sleep there, but I spend a lot of time, |
cte, in Charlotte. [think Tam the best
looking boy on the campus here but no-
body believes it but me. I have a dif-
ferent suit for every day in the week and
two on Sunday and all the other boys |
are so jealous of me, but they try to act |
indifferent and just laugh at me when I)
pass them. I have turned down offers |
from Hart, Shaffner & Marx, and others |
to be their living model because I would
rather stay at Davidson and be the best |
looking boy there. |

Now, Chester, it’s like this. 1
some new suits to keep up my_ social |
standing, and also some loud sweaters |
and neckties. I understand that Aus-|
traliashas quite an extensive collection
of these articles and I just wanted to}
ask you if you wouldn’t please bring me |
about twenty-five more suits back with |
you when you come, also some of the!
loudest nickers and sweaters you can.|
find. Also please, bring me the latest |
book on eitquette you can find. [I am a)
bit behind on this subject.

Yours for better clothes,

Gladney’s Weekly Essay |

Jazz P. Gladney, known for his scholar- |
ly diction and verbosity, also for his un- |
equalled fluctuations of language has |
consented to grace this column once a|
week with a subject of his own choos- |
ing. For this week he has chosen for
topic, "Why girls leave home, or R. L.
Johnston, hide your face.”

In promulgating your esoteric cogi-
tations or articulating your superficial |
sentimentalities and amicable, philoso-
phical, or psychological observations, be- |
ware of platitudinous ponderosity. Let |
your conversational communications |
possess a clarified consciseness, a com- |
pact comprehensibleness, coalescent con- |}
sistency, and concatenated cogency. Es-
chew all conglomerations of flatulent
garrulity, jejune babblement, and asinine
affectations. Let your extemporaneous
descantings and unpremeditated expa-
tiations have intelligibility and voracious
vivacity without rhodomontade or thras-
onical bombast. Sedulously avoid all
polysyilabfic profundity, pompous pro-
lixity, psittaceous vacuity, ventriloquial
verbosity, and vaniloquent vapidity. Shun
double entendre, prurient jocosity, and
pestiferious profanity, obscurant or ap-
parent.

nishing both music and noise for the oc-
casion. On Thursday three alumni were
present and they each gave a short talk.
One speaker said that he had been asked
if he were going to the Carolina game,
and had replied, “No, lam going to the
Davidson game.”

Jim) Hendrix, Harry Vanee, Lucian
Wells, Flake Laird and Tom Baker were
called on for talks. Each made a short
statement and the
team’s appreciation of such enthusiastic
backing of the student body.

Friday night at the meeting, a few of

were read to the assembly, and they

IDENTITY OF CHRIST IS
THEME

(Continued from page 1)

The argument was carried far cnough to
show how in the minutest detail, over 20 of
the Old ‘Testament prophecies were literally
fulfilled. The clarity and unmistakable
vividness with which the virgin birth, the
return from Egypt, the Triumphal Entry, the
details of the death on the cross, and the,
Resurrection were foretold, could leave no
doubt in the minds of any jury as to wheth
er or not Christ was the promised Messiah,

“There is not one chance ina million,”
said the speaker in conclusion, “that the evi
dence is not certain proof, But when we are,
dealing with the eternal destinies of souls,

we cannot afford to take even this chance.

God has promised to give us something, if
we only ask Him, and He has pledged His
Truth that He will give it, which will make
us absolutely certain that Jesus Christ is the
Messiah, and the Son of God. This is the
Holy Spirit, Who will come into our lives |
for the simple, sincere asking.”

McCravey and J. S. Grey rendered a beau
tiful cornet-violin duet, with Purdy ac-

companying. Professor Currie ably intro
duced the speaker. Chester Monk led the |
singing. |

With the season nine tenths over, one
cannot help from thinking of next year,
nor pass over the great work that Coach
Rawson is doing on Sprunt field. Out
of a conglomeration of material he has
built a machine that is so far undefeated
nor tied, with the goal line only twice
crossed in six games.
