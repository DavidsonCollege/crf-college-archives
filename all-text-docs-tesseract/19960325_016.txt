After confronting a hostile

audience, Christine Hoff Sommers
talks to two Davidson women about equity

feminism, Harlequin romance novels, and Hillary Clinton.

MARCH 19, 1996

Dr. Mills: In your book you suggest
that the “new feminists,” or the “gen-
der feminists,” may learn to “divest
themselves of the sex/gender lens”
through which they view “social re-
ality and join the equity feminist
mainstream.” Just give me some
definitions. How do you define
feminism?

CHS: Well, there are many different
schools, but I make a distinction, I
think there is a fundamental distinc-
tion between what I call equity femi-
nism and gender feminism. I hope
everyone is an equity feminist because
that is about simple fairness, accord-
ing women the same rights as men,
equality before the law, educational
parity. It’s, I think, very American; it
is grounded in the United States Con-
stitution. Gender feminism is very
different. Gender feminism grew out,
not out of the Enlightenment or the
United States Constitution. It’s devel-
oped from the radical politics of the
60s. Its philosophical mentors would
be Karl Marx or Marcuse, very radical.
It views American society as a patriar-
chy in which women are a subordinate
class. And the entire thing must be
radically transformed. So, equity femi-
nism is about reform and changing
laws and improving the condition of
women; gender feminism is about dis-
mantling of the patriarchy. It is a very
different and far more radical philoso-
phy. And I feel the majority of the
leaders in the feminist movement and
including the majority of the profes-
sional feminists in women’s studies
departments are more on the side of
gender feminists than equity feminists.

Dr. Mills: Just to clarify for me,
what exactly is the lens through
which equity feminism views real-
ity?

CHS: Equity or gender?
Dr. Mills: Equity.

CHS: Oh, equity feminists. It’s nota
lens. You just look for fairness. Also,
I would hope equity feminists are not
ideologues. They are not rigidly at-
tached to certain perspectives, so most
equity feminists could allow for diver-
sity. Some women are going to want to
be traditional moms, traditional wives.
Others will want to be very indepen-
dent, and that is very much in the spirit
of equity feminism, giving women
options, giving them choices. Gender
feminism will be there, very critical of
a woman that availed herself of tradi-
tional choices to become a traditional
wife and mother. She would explain to
her why she was playing into tradi-
tional gender roles. She would think
that this woman was someone who
needed her consciousness raised. I
call that elitist. How can you call any
American woman benighted and igno-
rant. We are among the most educated
and enlightened women in the world.
So, it is a very different perspective.
An equity women seems to me to not
need a lot of explanation, it is purely
simple. It just says that women enjoy
the same rights as men, but you are not
on an exotic hunt for bias under every
bed, as I feel the gender feminists are.

Jenny: Yousay that you area “femi-
nist who does not like what femi-
nism has become.” How do you

_ envision the feminist movement?

What would you like to see women
doing, or is there nothing to be done
anymore?

CHS: Well, first of all, just look around
because women are doing it. Look at
contemporary America
and you see that femi-
nism, equity feminism,
is the great American
success story. And it all
started in the second
wave of feminism in the
mid-70s. It wentso fast.
The gender feminists,
they are bitter, they’ll
say, “oh, we only earn
71 cents on the dollar.”
An equity feminist
would say, “My God,
we started, the wage gap
was enormous; itis clos-
ing so quickly.” And it
is not 71 cents on the
dollar, that is just a pes-
simistic overstatement
of how bad it is. They
want to give the most
negative bent on any-
thing that is happening
to women. If there is.
bad news, the gender
feminists are right there
to exaggerate it. If there
is good news, they don’t
seé it. What they don’t
see is if you control for
length of time in
workplace, same
education, and
you look at young,
women and
young men, the
wage gap is gone.
They don’t do
that. They want
to take women
like my sister who was out of the job
market for 20 years, compare her earn-
ings with those of a full-time male, and

-say there is discrimination. It is not

discrimination; she made a very dif-
ferent choice. She stayed home with
children for about 20 years.

Jenny: So, do you think there is
anything women do need to be work-
ing on to improve their situation?

CHS: Oh yes. I would say the glass is
three-quarters full and getting fuller,
but first of all there are still troglodytes
out there or, if you will, sexists. Males
and women who just don’t believe
women are as intelligent as men or

think that women are just hysterical,

and they are just wrong, they are ill-
informed. So that is always important,
to discredit the stereotypes. But the
gender feminists replace those with a
whole bunch of stereotypes about men.
And they see masculinity as danger-
ous, something that needs to be con-
trolled or changed. Well, the majority
of American women are not going to
be grateful to gender feminism if they
are able tocontrol masculinity. Imean,
we are not at war with men. So, I think
there are improvements, but the other
thing is, we have got to have a certain
grace in victory. There are many areas
where we have been so successful. Is
it now the males we have to worry
about. In schools, women are now
55% of college enrollment. And more

boys drop out; boys get lower grades.
Boysin high school are further behind.
So I don’t want to be gender chauvin-
ist. [don’t like male chauvinists and I
don’t like female chauvinists. I prefer
a feminism that is grounded in fair-
ness. By the way, a follow-up answer
is that the real battles of oppression are
not in the United States. I do not feel
that the language of gender feminism

WAR WITH MEN.

is appropriate in this country because
women have made so much progress.
But are there third world countries
where it does make sense to talk about
systemic oppression and patriarchy?
Yes. Sothatis another thing. We have
had our first and second waves of
feminism. American women are the
freest in the world. And I do think
there is an obligation to help women in
other parts of the world. But again I
hope that is equity feminism and not
gender feminism. I don’t think we
should export our male-bashing and
victimology.

Dr. Mills: In your book, you speak
about the majority of women’s stud-
ies classes, and you refer to that type
of class and other classes that teach
the “reconceptualization of subject
matter” as “unscholarly and intol-
erant of dissent and full of gim-
micks.” What is your ideal class-
room?

CHS: Well, as a philosophy professor,
in my ideal classroom, I address some
of the very things that in feminist peda-
gogy a critic would find very
masculinist. I like to, if possible, as-
sign the great works of philosophy. As
a feminist, I want women to read Plato
and Aristotle or Descartes and like it. I
don’t want to spend their time saying,
“Well, they were sexist and women
were....” That is not how you em-
power women. Youempower them by

giving them the kind of quality educa-
tion that young men traditionally were
able to have. So that is the first thing
is that I use books by DWEMs, the
dead white European males. And I try
tosethigh standards; I want students to
work very hard. And in the classroom
Iencourage debate. If I teach acontro-
versial issue, I consider it a sacred
command of college teaching to give
both sides. Ihave a set of opinions, but
I never see the classroom as a place for
me to export my opinions. I would feel
that class was a failure. I don’t want to
get papers where they write exactly
what I said. That’s depressing. What
youdoas ateacheris you give students
the tools to develop their own ideas,
draw their own conclusions. Youdon’t
give them conclusions. And in too
many women’s studies classes, they
get, “we live in a patriarchy.” And
they only learn about the world from a
feminist perspective.
Well, the feminist per-
spective, the gender
feminist perspective, is
important, but it is only
one of dozens. So if
young women are only
given in their women’s
studies programs, the
feminist perspective, or
the feminist-Freudian
perspective, or the femi-
nist-Marxist perspec-
tive, but they are never
given the Freudian per-
spective, or the tradi-
tional, the behaviorist
perspective or the lib-
eral or conservative or
whatever; there are so
many theories of human
nature; they should
study all of it. . . I think
young women can be
just as aggressive in de-
| bate as young men, and
if they are not, Iencour-
age them to be so.

Jenny: Therehas been
some debate about
your description
of Scarlett
O’Hara’s en-
counter with
Rhett Butler in
Gone With the
Wind, and “rav-
ishing” versus
“rape.” Why did
ar you choose that
scene when discussing rape scenes,
and do you think there is something
different about southern women?

CHS: Well, that is ascene which is the
most popular in cinematic history,
among women. I mean, men don’t
remember it, but women love that,
they love that scene and it’s in the
movie poster, just very famous and
very popular. And itis classic. It’s not
just Gone With the Wind, it’s not just
southern women; there’s a scene like
that in every romance story, you know
the bodice-rippers, the romance nov-
els, Harlequins. It is a standard scene

of asexual encounter, being overtaken, :

not raped, but “ravished” is the word I
guess you would use in the case of
Scarlett O’Hara. And again, I’m not
just sitting here wringing my hands
and thinking, “oh no, we’re so op-
pressed, we have to change so women
don’t have these fantasies.” And there
are women who are very upset with the
Harlequin novels and the Gone With
the Wind; they want to rewrite the
script, they want to change it. And I
think they don’tunderstand that women
don’ thave fantasies, women don’t want
to be raped, don’t want to have any-
thing to do with that. But obviously, if

we look at the sales of these books,
there is something about that kind of
fantasy that appeals to millions of
women, and it’s cross-cultural, These
Harlequin novels, they sell all over the
world. So, it’s not southern women.
And the other thing that bothers me is
women read these romance novels and
men think they are silly and criticize
women for reading them. And the
feminists think we’re silly and criti-
cize us for reading them. Everybody’s
down on women, but if you go to the
airports, there’s the romance novels
for the women and the spy/adventure -
novels for the guys. They often have a
guy overpowered by a beautiful
woman; read James Bond. You know,
it’s going on, and yet it’s the women
who get criticized and I just think it’s
innocent pleasure, a sexual reverie that
turns out to be, I guess, a quite com-

mon thing in literature.

Dr. Mills: I couldn’t wait to ask you
about what you think of Hillary
Clinton’s treatment in the press. Do
you feel that she is being bashed, or
rightly responded to?

CHS: Oh, thatis such a big subject and
everyone has opinions. Atsome levels
I feel sorry for her, but she did bring so
much of it on herself. I mean, what
was she thinking? That she could go in
having some experience as a governor’s
wife and a lawyer at the Rose Law
Firm, and she could go and rehabilitate
the American entire medical establish-
ment? That isnot a triumph of femi-
nism, it’s a triumph of being married to
someone who gives you this great plum
job. SoI don’t think she is a feminist
heroine in that sense, and she does
invite a certain amount of satire. I
think it’s absurd for people to say the
press isn’t ready for a strong woman.
The press is ready for strong women.

‘There’s Margaret Thatcher, there’s

Christie Todd Whitman, there’s Eliza-
beth Dole—she’s a strong woman. I
think that there’s been cruelty to her; it
has gone overboard, but to say that
people can’t handle strong women
seems to me to be abit absurd. There’s
strong women all over.

Dr. Mills: I was thinking more about
her open statements about herself as
a feminist.

CHS: I don’t think she’s been that
open about it. I know feminists have
sort of looked to her to be kind of a
leader, and I don’t think ‘she’s been
that eager to be there. I see her as
getting the kind of treatment as Dan
Quayle. And also you can feel sorry
for him, but there was something about
him that invited satire and humor. And
there is something about her. She’s the
same way.

Jenny: Who are some feminist hero-
ines both historically and in modern
times?

CHS: There are so many great women
writers and feminists particularly. I
want to urge every young lady to read
about Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Su-
san B. Anthony. Too many young
women forget that the rights we just .
take for granted women had to fight
for, women had to take tremendous
risks and hardship. There were hunger
strikes, there was imprisonment, alien-
ation from family, and every stressful
thing that could happen, happened to
women fighting to enjoy the simple
freedoms that most men enjoy. Those
are feminist foremothers. I love to
read about them and write about them
in books. Modern day, there are just so
many women that I do like. I like
Margaret Thatcher, Jeane Kirkpatrick,
and Lynn Cheney.
