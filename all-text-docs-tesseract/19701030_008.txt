The Ravitdaontast

Terriers Rushing Attack
Humiliate Wildcats, 35-13

By JOE EARLE
Sports Writer
“Terrible’ was the word
Dave Fagg thought best
summed up the Wofford

game.

“They playec an excellent
game of football,” Fagg,
head coach for the David-
son Wildcats. commented
later, ‘‘and we helped them
in a lot of ways.” :

The Wildcats were down-
ed by the Terriers of Wof-
ford 35-13 last week in
" Spantanburg, S. C.

“Wofford is, one of the
strongest teams ‘we have
played,” Fagg said. ‘‘They
had a terrifically powerful
offense.”

Wofford controlled the ball ;

throughout much of the
game, generally using a
ground attack against the
Wildcats.

“There was a great
variety in their attack,”
Fagg said, ‘‘sometimes they
“would run off guard, then
switch to -off tackle, and
then use end runs. We could

never know which they
would use.’
“They consistently came —

up with short yardage situa-
tions, say fourth and one or
two, which they always
managed to pick up.”

Fagg complimented the
abilities of the ‘Terriers
backfield, particularly | on
their speed and strength.

“They had one little full-
back who just didnt give a
damn,” he said. ‘‘He was
small, but he could break
through the line and be good
for four or five yards a
run,”

Fagg pointed out that the
members of the Terrier

backfield have been play-
ing together for four’ years,
and have become a _ highly
polished unit.

Fagg said he felt that the
problem of ball control, the
greatest problem facing the
Wildcats in the game, could
not be blamed on any one
unit of the Davidson team.

He _ stated
likely

though the
target for criticism

‘would be the defense. When

the defense did hold the
Terriers, the offense coulc
not capitalize on théir pos-
session of the ball.

“We would run_ three
plays .and have to punt,” he
said ‘‘which is not. the way
to control the game.”

Davidson suffered from
the inability to maintain a
sustained drive, turning the
ball over three times before
making a first down dur-

- ing the first quarter.

Later in the game, the of-
fense managed to get its
attack going, and- the ’Cats
made 19 first downs against
the Terriers 22.

Fagg cited’ several- in-
cidents during the game
that he felt greatly helped
the Wofford morafe, parti-
cularly. a fumble by Mark
Thompson on the two yard
line and interception.

“It’s hard to tell what
exactly caused the fumble,
but it appeared to be due
to a great. amount of pene-
tration through our line.
Thompson was hit while he
was pitching out, so he had
no control over the ball.”

Fagg said he was greatly
disturbed about the lack of
penalties throughout the
game, particularly the ab-

Behind 28-0 in the third
quarter, the Davidson Wild-
kittens staged a dramatic
comeback, only to see their
hopes dashed 42-29 on a
final surge by the Wake
Forest freshmen.

Wake Forest coming off a
victory over the North Caro-
lina freshman, surged to a

28-0 lead with the help of

four breakaway runs.

“Our defense played well
except on these four long
runs,’ Coach Gene McEver
commented. ‘‘We were set
up wrong on those four
plays and it certainly show-
ed,.”’

The Wake Forest running
game: ground out yardage
against the Kittens defense,
and running b
bry gained 287 yards.

‘But the second half be-
longed to the Wildkittens.
The Davidson running game
came alive, with John We-
bel scoring twice and gain-
ing 125 yards and quarter-
back Steve Keller running
in a score,

When— Frank -\MeShane—-

blocked a punt and fell on

- it in the. end zone for a
touchdown, suddenly the
score was 35-29.

(However, —-Wake
ran out the last four minutes
of the game, scoring again
when only twenty seconds
remained to assure them the
victory.

McEver was particularly
pleased that the running at-
tack got going this—week.
and also expressed pleasure
with the kickoff and punting
teams.

The loss evened the fresh
man record at 1-1. A week
from today the team plays
The Citadel tin another

calls. He:said be had régist
ered a. protest,

“Anyone can stop passing
the way they did,” he said,
“It’s disturbing to see the
way Lyon and Mikolayunus
had to fight for the ball.”

Poor passing hurt’ the
Wildcats, with Thompson
connecting for only ten out
of 27. Chandler for Wofford
hit nine of 11.

Penalites did not appre-
ciably hurt the Wildcats who
lost only gne yard, while
the Terriers were put back
42,

“The defensive secondary
was also a major problem,”
Fagg commented, ‘‘They
just didn’t seem to play up
to par. Everyone had a poor
game.”
