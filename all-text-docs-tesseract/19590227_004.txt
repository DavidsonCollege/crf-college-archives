British Statesman
Appears March 13

Clement Attlee, will appear
here on March 13 due to Vin-
cent Price’s postponement, C.’'
Shaw Smith, secretary of the
Artist Series, announced earlier
this week.

Lord Attlee is one of the
world’s greatest statesmen. He
was head of the British Labor
Party longer than any of his
forerunners, 1935-1955, and was
Prime Minister from 1945 to
1951.

As leader of the Labor Party
he led a “revolution by ballot”
in the 1945 general election
and for the first time in Eng-,
land’s history the Labor Party
won a clear majority, in Parlia- |
ment. His platform for that
election called for the nation-)
alization of heavy industries. |

Under his premiership the!
Labor. Government inaugurated;
a revolution in the social and
economic, fabric of Britain. It
changed the face of the Com-
monwealth.

In late 1955 he resigned his
post as leader of the opposition.
‘Now after two years he has re-
turned to America to undertake
a limited number of speaking
engagements. }

His talk at Davidson is to be)
entitled: “The Two Great Sys-
tems of Democratic Govern-
ment—Britain and U. S., Com-
pared.”

Ticket sales to Davidson stu-

more than 900, with other

sold near the 1250-seat capacity

“The IFC is especially en-
thusiastic over the student re-
sponse,” Anderson stated. “The
eoncert, which was not planned

will make a profit we will use

pense of Spring Frolics.”

Because of ‘the reaction of
the student body toward the

sold to the general public.

DAVIDSON

The fall of 1956 found Mr.
Charles Lloyd at Davidson Col-
lege teaching first and second
year English. He is “Crazy
about Davidson,” and said, “I
never saw so many fine people
in one spot in my life.” A re-
freshing lecturer and a friend
to all he meets, Mr. Lloyd én-
courages his students to come
to him with study problems. He
is also the reguiar teacher for
the college student's Bible
Class.

Mr. Lloyd plans to stay at
Davidson and hopes to finish
his master’s degree as soon as
possible. Having spent the past
two summers at UNC, he needs
only one more summer session
to complete work on this de-
gree. With a smile Mr. Lloyd
said, “This is something else

Would you favor abolishing
the Court of Control?

Green: I think the court is
definitely a vital part of Stu-
dent Government activity, that it
serves a real purpose in orient-
ing freshmen into Davidson tra-
dition. By having a more cen:
tralized. program and _ shorten-
ing the period of jurisdiction,
it would be much more ef-
fective than it has been in the
past.

Huie: The purpose of the
Court needs to. be re-defined.
I fayor continuation of the
court but feel that . . . with
better student support and such

re- changes as shortening the dura- of . the

tion of the court, it can be
stored to effectiveness.
Livingston: The Court of Con-

re-

introducing freshmen to the
spirit of Davidson College. Defi-
nitely it should be reorganized,
with this. ideal in mind.
HONOR SYSTEM
Comment on the present
Honor System. Would you fa-
vor any changes or fiberali-
zation? :

Green: I am for no liberaliza-}

tion of the-Honor System as it
is now set up. "s
Huie: I do not anticipate any
change in the Honor System.
Livingston: The Honor Sys-
tem should not be changed, but
I feel that the positive. ideal of

the system might be empha-

sized more.
UNLIMITED CUTS

Would you favor any sys-
tem of unlimited cuts at Da-
vidson? ;

Green: I do not think that a
system of unlimited cuts is a
sood idea. If such a system was
adopted I think it should be
on c- basis of acadéfnic achieve-

ment. If you look at it real-
istieally, there are some cours-
‘s you. wouldn't have to ‘at-
tend, But with unlimited cuts

you'd be cheating yourself and
your parents.

Huie: I favor experimenta-
tion with an unlimited cut sys-
tem. This; however, is not a
matter on which the council

ean legislate. I don’t see that
this is a matter which we can
legislate, but it is of general
interest.

Livingston: I fayor a system

of unlimited cuts and do not

why Davidson cannot insti-
such a system.

He has seen a large plant in

another west of town, but af-
ter a few scatteree questions
which produced no reasonable
answers, he assumed them. to

mediate purpose.

However, he would be
amazed had he been with me
the other day when I went’ to
find out their purpose. The
long, brick building, just north
access. road leading in-
to Davidson, houses a branch
of Bridgeport Fabrics, Inc. In
this plant are made zipper tapes

colors; a polyethelene plastic
strip used in making outdoor
‘furniture, primarily the alumi-

| num yard furniture; and auto-

Feature Writer

brics, Inc., the other two lo-
cated in Bridgeport, Connecti-
cut, and St. Hiason, Canada.

The operation of the three
hundred and twenty looms in
the plant is very interesting to
observe. The zipper tape fiber,
purchased in this area, goes
through the looms and is wov-
en into tapes of desired char-
acteristics. The zipper tapes are
then sent to. various plants
which are responsible for put-
ting the zippers themselves on
the tapes.

WINDLACE TAPES

The automobile windlace
tapes, made in colors corre-
sponding to the various car in-
teriors, are sent primarily - to
the Griswold Rubber Plant in
Mossoup, Connecticut,
the inner sponge is blown into
them. They are then sent back
to the Bridgeport concern in
Connecticut, where -final cor-
rections are made in order to
adjust the tapes to fit the vari-
ous style cars for which they
have been designed. At this
time they are sent to the. auto-
mobile. assembly lines, where
the tapes are installed into the
various cars.

Next I went to the Southern
Cotton Oil Division Wesson Oil

and Snowdrift Co., Inc., located
between Davidson and Corne-
lius. This plant primarily pro-
duces cotton crude oil, but be-
cause of the seasonal nature
of this product, it also makes.
fertilizer, a year round busi-

where’

ness.

Due to the Soil Bank pro-
gram, the Davidson division was
not able to procure enough cot-
ton seed to merit operation of
the plant this year, but next
year it will continue this seg-
ment of its business. The cot-
ton seed oil business normally
runs from around September to
April. However, at present the
plant is making only fertilizer.

TRADE SECRETS

The fertilizer is made pri-
marily from nitrogen, super
phosphate and pot ash, pur-
chased in New Mexico. There
are other ingredients which are
trade secrets, these distinguish-
ing this fertilizer from that of
other companies.

The processing of the cotton
seed is very interesting. The
cotton seed, after it has been
extracted from the cotton at
the gins, is purchased by the
Wesson Oil Company. The seed
is then sent through a de-linter
machine which> removes the lint
from the seed.

The shaved seed is then in-
troduced into a boiling solution
and the oil is squeezed from
the seed. Previously the juice

was extracted from the seed
by multiton blocks pressing
against the seed, but this
proved too inefficient, as there
was always a large percentage
of oil left in the seed. Now the
plant employs automatic
squeezers which extract almost
all of the oil from the seed.
