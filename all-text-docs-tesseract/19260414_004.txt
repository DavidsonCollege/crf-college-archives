while one weck later, Davidson downed the
Terriers at Spartanburg 86 to 36. In both
instances the tracks were slow due to rain
‘and unconditioning. South Carolina had had
only one week of practice before the Wofford
encounter and all the times for the dashes
; Were improved the next week ina meet which
'they lost to Presbyterian College of South
Carolina 71 to 55,

The mainstays of the Gamecocks are Ver-

ner, in the 100 and 220 yard dashes; Gaston
and Shand, in the high jump; Gaston, in the
hurdles, and Brewer and Siedeman in the
weights. In one weeks’ time between the
| Wofford and Presbyterian meets, Verner
| brought down his time on the 220 1 4-5 sec-
onds, Gaston, in the high jump, tied for the
lonly first place secured by the Gamecocks in
{the meet with North Carolina.

| The vast improvement showed by the Da-

| vidson cinder stars in the meet last Saturday
was very encouraging. Three school records
| were smashed when Goodykoontz broke the
{tape in both the century and 220 dashes in
better time than any other Davidson man had
|done, and Penn ran away with the two-mile
in the record time of 2:26 1-2.

Miller, Alexander, |

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

We had two track meets last Saturday—
at Davidson and at Greensboro, The first
was with the University of North Carolina

track team, and the second was with the

Duke University baseball team. Duke did
most of the tracking at Greensboro, however,
due to the inevitable miscues of the Davidson
Wildcats.

“If you'd seen the team playing Saturday,”
said Coach Monk when he came back to Da-
vidson, “you would never have recognized
it as the same team which had played in
games before. They were playing 50 per
cent off their form that afternoon, missing
several straight chances at easy force outs.”

Maybe there will be a track meet with
Duke again on May 8th, at Gastonia, but we
hope our boys will receive a good workout
covering the bases at that time—this being
the last game of the season. ‘Do unto oth-
{ers as they have done unto you,” ought to be
the motto of the team at that time.

But let’s get back to that other track meet.
We lost, but what a track affair it, was!
Three college records—all broken in one day.
It’s sad to lose the meet, but it’s a glad feel-
ing to know that we have some men who are
proving to be extraordinary good steppers
on the cinder path.

Harry Goodykoontz broke a couple of

them—one-fifth of a second off the hundred
and two-twenty dashes. Clement Penn
knocked off 6 4-5 seconds from the two-mile
run, It was all good to see. We honestly
believe that Harry will lower the record on

the 220 hefore the season is over, since he!
got off to a bad start, and we believe that |
Clement can sever his own record, since he!
has unoffcially lowered it already more than |

eight seconds in the practice.

o

The 440-yard men had to jump over a dog

in their dash around the track, but even then |

winnings. But only four of them count in

us in Greensboro. We don’t have a game

/deal depends on the games we win from the
other teams.

University of South Carolina team here last

Tennis Team Leaves on
| Annual Spring Tour to
Encounter Four Schools

| Wofford, Georgia Tech, Clemson and
University of South Carolina

to be Played

The tennis team began their annual trip on
On this trip they will
meet four of the principal tennis teams in the
South,

Tuesday morning.

Both doubles and singles will be
played.
The schedule is as follows: April 13, Wof-
ford College at Spartanburg, S. C.; April 14,
, Georgia Tech at Atlanta, Ga.; April 15,
Clemson College at Calhoun, S. C.; April
16, a return match with the University of
South Carolina at Columbia, S. C.
Wofford are the champions of South Caro-
lina, and Tech always has one of the strong-
est teams in the South. Little is known about
the comparative strength of Clemson. How-

ever, Davidson has already - won three
matches this year, including one from South
Carolina, and has a fine chance of winning
all their matches. It was thought that the
loss would weaken the team, but Davidson's
play against South Carolina last Saturday
| proved otherwise.

The players who will make the trip are:
L. M. McCutcheon, captain; R. W. Carr, S.

W. Brown, J. A. McAlpine, and H. M.
| Austin, manager and substitute.
|

Watch Elon! We thought Wake Forest
had the best team in the state, but Elon and
Guilford put the skids under the Baptists.
Fogleman and Smith are two of the best
pitchers in the state, and if these men are
sent agdinst Davidson, the Wildcats will need
to have their eyelids pulled back considerably
to catch on to the delivery of these men.
