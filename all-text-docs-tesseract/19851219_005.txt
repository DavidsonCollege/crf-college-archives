Thursday, December 19, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Lady Cats suffer narrow defeat

By EDWIN PAGE

Last Thursday the Davidson
women’s basketball team saw
their record drop to 2-2 as they lost
a heart-breaker to Greensboro
College 71-69 in Johnston Gym.
Although the Lady Cats failed to
win, they showed the home fans a
remarkably improved version of
basketball.

Davidson jumped out to a big
early lead behind the strong play
of freshman Lavetta Dawkins, but
Greensboro began to claw back.

The Cats could not handle the

Hornet press and watched as their.

lead dwindled slowly. By
halftime Greensboro had overta-
ken Davidson and held a 34-30 ad-
vantage.

The second half looked for a
while to be all Greensboro, but
Davidson, down by as much as 10
at one point, refused to fold.
Junior Heather McKee began to
find the range and the Cats started
to close the gap.

Davidson finally came all the
way back, taking the lead late in
the game and holding on until the
last minute. With less than 30 sec-
onds to go Davidson held a three-
point advantage, but twice could
not convert on chances from the
free-throw stripe.

With eight seconds left,
Davidson still held a one-point
lead, and junior Jenny Artman
was at the line. The shot rolled off
the rim and Greensboro collectea

the rebound and sprinted down-
court. With one second showing,
the Hornet’s Donna Christy put
the ball in and was fouled. She hit
the ensuing free-throw and David-
son’s last second prayer fell short,
giving Greensboro the two-point
victory.

Despite the loss, it was a solid
game for the Cats. Dawkins led
the team with 29 points, junior
transfer Artman added 12 and
senior guard Amy Hartman and

McKee each added 10. Dawkins
complemented her sensational
scoring with 12 rebounds and five
blocked shots while McKee grab-
bed 11 rebounds.

The Cats go home for the holi-
days and resume their schedule
Jan. 8 at St. Andrews. With two
wins already under their belt and
averaging a surprising 71 points
per game, the Cats look forward to
having a strong, competitive sea-
son.

Who's On First ?-

By ANDY BARRON

As Christmas stares America in the
face, the year of sports comes to a close.
1985, like any year in sports, has had its
ups and downs. In case you had forgot-
ten, here they are, the winners and losers,
good and bad, in the world of sports in
1985.

All sports years both begin and end
with college football, not because college
football has anything over allt other
sports, but because tradition demands
that the sport ends on New Year’s Day.
Brigham Young won the national cham-
pionship with a wimpy schedule that
‘made their undefeated season possible.
The losers in college football continued
to be the fans who wanted a play-off sys-
tem instead of a ballot box to determine
the national gridiron champ. As the holi-
days approach, and the bow] games with
them, chaos threatens to reign again if
Penn State doesn’t win the Orange Bowl.

The San Francisco 49ers won the °85
Super Bow! over Miami. Unfortunately
for 49ers fans, their team hasn't played
well since. Fall 1985 has belonged to the
Chicago Bears, complete with Re-
frigerator, as they rampage through the
NFL. Tune in next year to discover
whether or not the Bears can churn their
way to a Super Bowl crown.

The big winner in college basketball,
Villanova, surprised everyone, even the
team that was supposed to win, Geo-
rgetown. Villanova played a flawless
title game to beat the proud Hoyas, the
game's overwhelming favorite, and pro-
vide 1985’s biggest upset.

Other surprises this year included
Wimbledon champion Boris Becker and
Sports Illustrated discovery Sidd Finch.
Becker, at 17, became the youngest
Grand Slam event winner in the history of
tennis. In addition, “Das Wunderkid”
became the first unseeded player to win
Wimbledon. Finch appeared in Sports I!-
lustrated in a George Plimpton story.
Finch, a former Harvard student turned

The best and worst of ’85

Buddhist priest, had mastered the “pitch”
and could throw a 168 mile per hour
fastball. Few people seemed to realize
the issue came out on April Fool’s Day
and was Plimpton’s joke, because sub-
scriptions were cancelled.

The most important story in the world
of sports happened in Brussels as 38
people died as a result of crowd violence
at the European Cup championship game
between Liverpool and Javentes, one of
soccer’s premier events. Poor seating ar-
rangements, barbaric fans and slow
police response combined to cause the
tragedy. As a result of the violence, the
European Soccer Federation banned En-
glish soccer clubs from playing on the
European continent.

Scandals raged in college football
and basketball. Almost every school in
the Southwest Conference had their foot-
ball team put on probation. Game fixing
ended the basketball program at Tulane
and the Memphis State program came
under siege as allegations piled up con-
ceming coach Dana Kirk and pay-offs to
players. College sports do not appear to
be getting closer to eliminating cheating
because the fans do not seem to care
about rule violations. In Kentucky, when
a local paper printed results from a
lengthy investigation that found rampant
violations, fans got mad at the paper, not
the basketball program.

The best news of 1985 was what
didn’t go wrong; namely, that a baseba
strike that threatened to kill the season
ended after two days. This quick settle-
ment allowed the Kansas City Royals,
who were out-Cinderallaed only by Vil-
lanova, to win the World Series.

Individuals made 1985 a particularly
memorable year. Living legends Wayne
Gretzky and Walter Payton added to their
mystiques, Gretzky by leading Edmon-
ton to its second straight Stanly Cup and
Payton by heading the Chicago Bears’
charge toward the play-offs. Each of
these superstars has a serious claim to

“Best Ever” in their respective sports.
These are two to tell the grandchildren
about.

Baseball had a bevy of accomplish-
ments sure to put bronze on the walls of
Cooperstown. Tom Seaver and Phil
Niekra each won their 300th game and
Rod Carew got his 300th hit, ensuring all
will reach the Hall of Fame. Pete Rose,
who has had a place reserved for him in
Cooperstown for over five years, finally
caught Ty Cobb and became baseball's
alltime hitting lord.

1985 leaves a lot of unanswered ques-
tions:

What happened to Carl Lewis? or
John McEnroe? the USFL? the Chicago
Cubs?

When will Mary Lou Retton get off

Finally, no year in sports would be
complete without the personal triumphs
of the everyday athlete. Congratulations
to all IMAC teams, not only those that
won, but to all who had fun.

Also, congratulations to Angelo
Spagnolo, the World’s Worst Avid
Golfer by means of the 257 he shot for 18
holes in the PGA-sponsored event to de-
termine who actually held such a dubious
honor. 1985 sure was fun!
