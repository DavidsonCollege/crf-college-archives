Brandon Conducts Services;
“Forgiveness” Is Subject Of
Talk By Coit

The Vesper Service last Sunday was
conducted entirely by the students, with
Bob Coit as chief speaker. The subject
was “Forgiveness.”

Don Brandon opened the service with
a responsive reading which was followed
by a prayer by “Duke” Glasgow. Hubert
Morris, with Carleton Chapman as or-
ganist, led the audience in the singing
of three hymns.

Bob Coit read as his text Matthew
18:21-35, which brings out in two inci-
dents, the main point.
Coit pointed out that ‘Forgiveness is in-
separably entwined with love. The con-
nection is so close that it can not be
broken. There was a man who, on his
deathbed promised to forgive his enemy.
‘Of course, the man said, ‘if I recover
the grudge still holds.’ This illustrates
lucidly the wrong attitude fora for-
giving heart to assume. A friend is a
person who loves you despite all your
faults, a person who can forgive your
mistakes and still think the same of you.
We pray: ‘Forgive our debts as we for-
give our debtors.’ First we must for-
give before we expect God to forgive
us.”

Peter was a very devoted disciple, but
he showed weak points and at times
seemed childish. He said to Christ in
the twenty-third chapter of Matthew:
‘Lord how oft shall .my brother sin
against me, and I forgive him? till seven
times?’ Jesus said in response: ‘I say

forgiveness, as

not unto thee until seven times; but,
until seventy times seven.’
Two Koreans had been thrown into

prison and treated violently with various
forms of torture under inhuman condi-
tions. In speaking to the man in charge
they expressed no hatred.to this officer
but only the hope that he might bé a
Christian and adopt a Christian attitude.

Americans showed their lack of for-
giveness. After the war they regarded
the Germans with scorn and utter hatred.
The German language was not taught
to a lerge extent in this country. Stu-
dents of this campus do not always for-
give their fellows for their faults. We
do not do as Christ did, when He said
at the crucifixion: ‘Father, forgive them
for they know not what they do.’

yard marker. Two thrusts at center
proved unsuccessful, so Warren skirted
his own left end for the remaining five
to give the Baptists a six point lead.

Tex Edens was sent into the game at
this point to attempt a placement for the
extra point but he failed to convert.

For the remainder of this period the
teams played on fairly even terms with
the ball staying around midfield most of
the time.

Shortly after the second quarter began
the 'Cats taking the ball on their own
25 used only

four plays—te—put—them-
selves on the opponents five. Mackorell
smacked left tackle for the first five
yards of this distance, Wingfield slipped
through center for the next sixteen, he
then flipped a pass to Hutchins to take
and advance it 20 more, and Mackorell
shot an aerial to Wingfield, who gathered
the pigskin in on the 25 and raced to
the five before he was pulled down by
a pair of Wake backs.

Mackorell and Wingfield were then
stopped for no gain in respective drives
at center, but on a third play the Wildcat
captain shot a short pass to the infallible
Jim Morgan who snagged it over the
goal for Davidson's initial counter.

Paul Pittman substituted for Wingfield
and place kicked a beautiful boot directly
through the uprights and over the bar
for the seventh and winning point. Score
Davidson 7 Wake Forest 6,

Neither team threatened again. during
the first half until shortly before the end
of the quarter the Deacons were halted
in a sustained drive, which began on their
own 39, when Wood Burns, Presbyterian
center intercepted one of Kitchins passes
on the ’Cats’ 25.

In the third period the Cats came to
life again and pushed the ball from mid-
field to the one yard with Mackorell and
Wingfield cracking sthe Deacon forward
wall at will. Mackorell took it over
from the one driving with invincible
power.

The Deacons, however, still had a
scare in the bag, and when Pittman
kicked off to them they held the ball
until Holton took it over from the one
yard marker, getting it across the last
line by only a few inches.

Edens again went to try for a place-
ment, but this time his boot apparently
headed for the promised land, was block-
ed by Coley Windham, Davidson right
end.

When the final whistle sounded the
cats were on the Deacs 15 making their
way rapidly toward another score,

Carolina Leads As
State Race Ends

(Continued from Pafe 4)

The Carolina Far Heels clinched the
championship of the Big Five conference,
November 17, with a thrilling 7-0 win
over Duke. Carolina maintained a clear
advantage in the viciously fought gam®.

Davidson and Wake Forest met on
Richardson Field November 29 in their
annual Thanksgiving classic with the
Wildcats emerging victorious, 13-12. The
game was close and packed with many
thrills with the brilliant play of Mack-
orell deciding the issue.

Duke and State closed the conference
on a mud-covered field. last Saturday
with the Blue Devils displaying a pow-
erful attack which netted them a 32-0
victory.

He was very ably supported by ‘Wal-
ter “Dahlia” Dixon, and Hank “Holly-
hock” Loftin, in the backfield and Fritz
“Jonquill” Byerly and “Pretty Boy” Mc-
Nabb in the line.

Watts, still wondering watts up, is able
to boast of such limelight holders as Os-
car “Tea Pourer” Bethea, Walter “The
Goon” Sprunt, George “Triple-Threat”
Tipton, andy Scott ‘“Charlotte’s Own”
Shepherd.

The first threat of the game came when
the Georgia boys drove the ball to their
opponents’ ten yard line only to lose it
on downs, This drive down into Watts
territory was featured by runs of Part-
ridge and Dixon, sidewheeling aces of
the Georgia eleven.

All during the first half the two aggre-
gations sea-sawed around mid-field with
the Georgia crew having somewhat the
better record for gains in every depart-
ment.

The second half opened with both
teams seemingly invigorated from the
half time rest, but evidently the Georgia
Rats were more thoroughly recuperated
during this period, and,
came back more strongly to immediately
march down into Watts territory.

Coach Ravenel’s boys took the pigskin
on the opponents’ 46 yard line. On the
first play “Dixie” Partridge passed to
Loftit for 20 yards and a first down.
The ball now resting on the 26 yard
marker. Partridge then got five through
the line, and Guerrant goes through for
a first down. Resorting then to uncanny
tactics the Georgia quarterback called
a lateral pass play. The center sent the
pigskin back to Guerrant, who in turn
relayed it to’ Partridge, scintillating
Georgia halfback, who after eluding sev-
eral tacklers made his way to the prom-
ised land.

Loftin, another well poised back on
this Georgia eleven, heaved a nice aerial

to Partridge for the extra point, making
the score Georgia 7, Watts 0.

The leading team then kicked off to
their opponents, and on the first play
after the kick off “Tea Pourer” Bethea
dropped back and whipped a pass which
was intended for Sprunt, but accidentally
fell into the arms of “Goofy” Cook,
Crochet center, who wriggled his way
through the entire Watts team twenty-
five yards for a touchdown. An at-
tempted pass for the extra point was
blocked. Score: Georgia 13, Watts 0.

Before another kick off the third quar-
ter ended, and it seemed to stop the ap-
parently invincible march of the “sew-
ing club,” and the losers stiffened to hold
the victors scoreless for the remaining
time.

The crowd then gathered around the
press box while “True Blue” Monroe
presented the trophy of victory (nozzle
off the hose used in Monday night’s fra-
cas) to the winning team.

Thus endeth another year of grid his-
tory, and a marvelous day of entertain-
ment in Davidson’s back yard.

turners, led by George Wingfield, brought
back opposition punts a total of 358 yards
as compared with 157 yards for opposing

punt returners. The comparative small

yardage of punt returns by the opposi-
tion was due to the splendid high punting
of Johnny Mackorell, and the brilliant
work of Siewers, Morgan, and Windham
in getting down under those punts.

Army, as expected, proved to be David-
son’s strongest opponent, and although
the Southerners fared in pretty good
style during the first half, the cadet team,
led by “Texas Jack” Buckler, Simons,
Stancock, and several others, waylaid
the locals in the last half to pile up a
total of 41 points.

All seniors who plan to have a snap-

Smith before the Christmas vacations.
This will be the dead line for boys get-
ting them in. It is very important that
all seniors get these in’as it has a lot
to do with making a good annual and
so far the response has been very poor.
The request for the taking and getting of
these pictures has been asked for many
times and has had very poor response so
please try and get your pictures taken
and the snapshots in before the Christ-
mas holidays.

IM men of the South have

been “in tobacco” for years—growing tobacco
and curing it—buying it and selling it—until
they know tobacco from A to Izzard:

Harvesting to-
~baccoand packing
it in the barn for
curing—and (be-
low) a scene at a
Southern tobacco
auction.

Now folks who have been in tobacco all
their lives, folks who grow it, know there i is
no substitute for mild ripe tobacco.

And down in the South where they grow tobacco

and where they ought to know something about it—in
most places Chesterfield is the largest-selling cigarette.
