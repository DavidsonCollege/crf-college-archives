WAKE FOREST

By
BILL BRIGGS

Sports Editor

Between shouts of “Beast State” and the hollow
thumping of basketballs against the hardwood court,
Coach Lefty Driesell shouted orders to his some-
what green basketball squad.

Last night Driesell led his predominantly sopho-
more squad against N. C. State in a closed scrim-
mage.

“We'll probably start Snyder and Lane at the
wings, with Stone and Leight substituting,” Drie-
sell prophesied.

“Squier will play the point, with Hatcher as
the main reserve here; Clifton and St. Clair will
play some at the point, also.

“Youngdale and Knowles will play a double
pivot. Leight will back them up, too.”

In less than two weeks Davidson’s attention will
turn once more toward basketball as Wake Forest
travels to the Charlotte Coliseum to face the ’Cats
in the opening game for both teams.

For the past three years the Wakies have been
completely overshadowed by Hetzel and company,
but this year could be different.

“We will have no chance at all.to see them play
this year,” Driesell moaned. “Usually we get to see
their freshman-varsity game, but this year they
called it off.” a

With Bob Leonard and Pavi.Long at the guards,
both All-ACC material, and Leonard a shoo-in for
some All-American teams, Wake Forest will be tough
this year. With a new coach and the fact we haven't
been able to scout them at all, Wake Forest will
have a definite advantage in the element of surprise.

But the Baptists lack height. We don’t. Even
green, with enough effort and composure, Knowles
and Youngdale should allow Davidson to contro! the
backboards and the outcome.

NOTES AND QUOTES

Driese!l will take his roundball hopefuls to
Knoxville, Tenn. over the Thanksgiving holidays to
scrimmage with the University of Tennessee.

Dr. Tom Scott on the new basketball bleachers
being added at the south end of the court: “These
permanent bleachers will hold Jess, but folks can see
more ... and we won't be bothered by little kids
falling through the seats.”

The Trustees recently ruled there will be no
intercollegiate contests held on Sundays, which ef-
fectively sinks the sailing team, a¢ most regattas are
Saturday and Sunday affairs.

In conjunction with “The Holy Ban”, the Trus-
tees ruled that there will be no organized, compul-
sory Sunday practices in any .athletics, this ends
Coach Homer Smith’s football workouts.

Our sailors and footballers may not be in as
good shape or win as much under the new rule,
ut at least they will no longer be condemned to
eternal hell, fire, and damnation . . . truly a re-
markable achievement by a small body of mortals.

Davidson should end its football season with two
close victories, 21-7 over Wofford and 28-22 over

Bucknell. But unless our offense snaps out of the +

lull] it has been in ever since the Furman. game, we
will undoubtedly be wiped off the field by both of
these teams.

No defensive team can hope to hold their op-
ponents when they have the ball for an entire half.

At 6:30 p.m., tomorrow, after the football and
soccer games and before the concert, the freshmen
meet the varsity basketballers in Johnston Gym-
nasium.

JOHNNY WALKER MEETS LEHIGH LINEMAN
Carries Ball In Last Home Action

END YEAR THURSDAY

Gridmen Face Bisons

By CLIFF DUKE
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson will close one of its best seasons ever as host to the Bucknell Bisons
on Thanksgiving Day in Charlotte.

The game, billed as the Car-
rousel Bowl, will match a Wild-
cat squad seeking to equal a
Davidson record for wins in one
season against last year’s Lam-

tbert Cup winners, Kick-off will
be at 7:30 p.m:

Bucknell will resemble George
Washington. They will try to
drive the ball at the Gurkhas,
mixing a sound running game
with the accurate tosses of Bill
Lerro to Little All-American end
Tom Mitchell and Ron Kinsey.

The offense usually deploys in
an I-formation with a split end
and flankerback. Over-all, Buck-
nell will outweigh the ‘Cats by a

few pounds per man. They com-
plement this heft with good team
speed and aggressiveness.

Captain Jeff Traub,. a 225-
pound center, will anchor a good
offensive line, which paves the
way for the talented running of
tailback Bob Coons. Offensive
spark is also generated by Ler-
ro, a fine passer. But the major
offensive threat is Mitchell. The
6-3 Pennsylmanian possesses ex-
ceptional speed and reach, and
a knack for eluding a defender.

Last year his 71 receptions
smashed school records, and he
is expected to go in the early
rounds of pro football's draft

ae
Defensively, lineman Dean
Stump heads an- aggressive
group that yields ground grudg-
ingly. The Bisons hope to thwart
Jimmy Poole’s passing with a
strong defensive secondary.
This game will mark the first
meeting of the two teams on the
gridiron. While the ‘Cats tackle
Wofford tomorrow, Bucknell and
Delaware will scrap for the Mid-
dle Atlantic Conference title.
Coach Smith flatly states that
Bucknell will be superior to Le-
high or Lafayette. Although
Davidson registered wins over
both, the final football review
for 1965 will be a tough contest.

Terriers Test "Cats

By YATES FAISON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson's footballers meet an underrated Wofford squad at Richardson Field

Coach Homer Smith regards
Wofford as “far better than
either of the two teams we
played last, in that they are big-
ger and faster and have a much
greater offense.’ Their 35-13
victory over Furman evidences
that.

The basis for the Terriers’ of-
fensive excellence .is what Wof-
ford terms its ‘‘dream_ back-
field.’ Quarterback Warren
Whitaker and halfbacks Ted
Phelps and Bill Ellis have pro-
vided what Coach Smith terms
‘‘a most unusual offensive yard.
age production.”

To say that the Terriers main
threat comes on the ground
would be to miss the point, al-
though their top backs are aver-
aging over five yard per carry.
Wofford’s attack is quite a diver.
sified one, Whitaker leading the
charge with over 1000 yards in
total offense.

_ tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. in the Wildcats’ final home contest t
another strong test after prov-

necessity that the Wildcats out-
hit and out-hustle Wofford in
order that they may cope with
the size disadvantage. ‘Our
main objective in every game is
to win in hitting and hustling
if not in outcome.”

The Gurkhas could be put to

ing themselves again in last
week’s victory over Lafayette.
George Solley will be returning
to the lineup after missing two
games. Dick Short and Stu Per-
ry remain on the injured list for
tomorrow's game.

Gurkhas Shine
As Leopards Fall

In reference to their game-

with Furman, Coach Smith re-
marked, ‘‘They looked much bet-
ter throughout the game than
Furman — quite a bit so. The
score was a true picture of how
they played.”’ Such was not the
case later when they were de-
feated by Catawba, 29-26, al-
though they gained about 450
yards,

Asked if Wofford’s week lay-
off before this, their final game,
will have any effect pro or con,
Coach Smith said, ‘They sche-
duled the layoff on purpose.
Personally, I don’t think it helps
or hurts, although they seem to
feel that it helps. This is their
big game.”

Wofford's record thus far is an
impressive 5-3 with victories
over Carolinas Conference
champion Lenoir Rhyne, Fred-
erick, Furman, Newberry, and
Appalachian. Defeats have been
incurred at the hands of Pres-
byterian, Catawba, and East
Tennessee State.

FACE WAKIES IN OPENER

Lefty’s Legions Ready For Season

By STEVE BROWN
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Standing in a dressing
room amid such signs as
“Let’s get tough on de-
fense!’”’, Coach Lefty Drie-
sell of Wildcat basketball
fame scratched his head and
said noncommittally, ‘‘Prac-
tice is going about like us-
ual, I guess. Of course, it’s
hard to evaluate a team or
its chances until they’ve
actually played a game or

0.”

Driesell, who has piloted Wild-
cat hardwood teams to two na-
tional rankings and a better than
71% success average, 91 victor-
ies against 37 defeats in five
seasons here, was. as usual,
wary of making risky state-
ments: “I don’t ever make pre-
dictions about basketball; I just

j like to say that we'll try to be
on time for the game.”

“We've been practicing since .

October .15, working two hours

every day. The most important
part of good basketball is fund-
amentals, so in these practices
we've been stressing things like
ball-handling, defensive drills,
and rebounding. We're just try-
ing to get ready to play, that's
all.”

Betas Top Also-Rans, Take Second

By JIM MARROW
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The fourth annual battle
for second place ended this
week as the Betas ran their
record to 11-1 with victories
over the KA‘s, Nus and
ATO’s.

Fiery Arch McCallum led the
late season spurt scoring three
touchdowns in the final two
games. After the KA’s fell, the
Betas demoralized the Sigma
Nus, 66-0. The climax of the
game came as notorious “Lit-
tle Brother’ Burch landed a
slashing block . . . on a fellow
Nu. Both were treated at Prey-
er infirmary.

The ATO’s began a comeback
(after the Betas scored) that
mysteriously coincided with the
arrival of Terible Tom Scott
from the soccer field. Tailback
Dave Townsend was outstantiing
in the Tau's effort. The Betas
were without the services of
star tweenerback Chip Vogan
who forgot about the game.

Geordie Mueller and the
Sigma Chis closed fast with

victories over the Phi Gamms,
KA’s and Phi Delts to wrap up
third place. In other games

the Delts took a decision from
the Independents, the Phi
Gamms edged the Pi Kapps,
21-14 and the Sigma Nus for-
feited to the Pikas.

The results of the important
battle between the Pi Kapps
and the Independents were not
available. A loss for either
team would mean last place in
the final standings.

The Kappa Sigs who clinched
the title a week ago were idle.
Their success this year was said
to have been due to a splendid
performance by “rookie Steve
Rostan. Tommy Reams, the big
end, added that their sucecss
could also be attributed to their
clean living.

The freshman league saw
East B remain undefeated by
Cannon A. Tailback Steve Faulk
was outstanding in the win. A
highlight of the game came as

Faulk was trapped and threw
in desperation to K. D. Weeks
who displayed amazing open
field running before being down-

ed at the goal. The play was
called back because Weeks had
come off the bench during the
play.

Lefty went on to comment on
his probable starting lineup for
the season and mentioned that
sophomores would be carrying
a good deal of the load since
four of the 1964 first-stringers —
Don Davidson, Fred Hetzel,
Charlie Marcon, and Barry
Teague — were graduated last
spring.

“Well, I guess you could say
that Dick Snyder will probably
start." he gririned, ‘‘and we're
also likely to have Bobby Lane,
Phil Squier, Rod Knowles, and
either Tom Youngdale or George
Leight on the first five. Of
course, that list is not definite,
and I think Pinky Hatcher, Ron-
nie Stone, Barry St. Clair and
Cecil Clifton will be playing a
good bit of basketball for us,
too.”

Driesell went on to comment
about his first opponent, Wake
Forest. ‘“‘We won't know too
much about Wake Forest before
the opener on December 1 since
it will be their first game of the
season, too. We'll be playing an
intrasquad game in Charlotte
on November 27, but I don’t be-
lieve we'll be able to scout them
at all,""-he mused.

“They have some good boys.

a real fine athlete. There's also

Booters Top Paladins, 3-1
Take Tourney’s Opener

By DOUG CRISP
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson’s soccer team defeated Furman yesterday, 3-1, in the first round of
the Southern Conference Soccer Tournament being held here on campus.

“We played real well and got
back to scoring a little. which
we hadn‘t done’ in the last few
games,” remarked Coach Harry
Fogleman after the game.

“The whole forward line play-
ed a great game,” he added. “I
really couldn't single out any
one person; it was a fine team
effort."

Saturday the Wildcat booters
whipped Emory, 3-0, in Atlanta.
The Eagles were previously un-
defeated in 10 games.

“That was another team ef-
fort,” Fogleman mused. “We
used everyone on the bench.”

West Virginia and George
Washington are co-favorites to
grab the first annual confer-
ence championship in soccer in
the round-robin tournament be-
ing held here through tomorrow.

The team or teams with the
best record in the tourney will
be declared Southern Conference
co-champions. in soccer.

“The Southern Conference
has now recognized soccer as
an official sport and this con-
ference championship is the be-
ginning of more emphasis on
soccer,” pointed out host coach
Fogleman.

“The defense — magnificent!” These were the
words of Coach Homer Smith as he described the
“Gurkhas,” Davidson’s defensive unit, and their
second half effort to stymie the surging Leopards
of Lafayette, there Saturday,

Lafayette drew first blood with a 20-yd. field
goal, but Davidson came back to score twice in the
second quarter. The ’Cats capitalized on a Buddy
Newsome pass interception with Steve Smith scor-
ing on a four-yd. plunge. Later in the same quarter
Jimmy Poole marched the ’Cats 56 yards, culminat-
ing the drive with a nine-yard pass to end Ken Ken-
dall in the end zone.

The second half found the Leopards able to
move the ball well between the two 20-yard lines.
They controlled the game for all but four series of
downs, and they managed to score on a 25-yd. run
late in the third quarter to make the score 14-10.

Davidson’s second half strategy summed-up
was ball control, not to fumble and not to let them
intercept a pass. At this the ‘Cats succeeded but at
the expense of marking only one first down.

About the second half Coach Smith said, ‘“La-
fayette knew we wouldn't throw. They were in their
goal-line defense the whole second half with the
toughest man-to-man coverage. If we had the game
to play over again, we would play the second half
quite differently.”

The highlight of the game was the Gurkhas’
goal-line stand. With the score 14-10 in latter min-
utes of the fourth quarter and with a first and goal
on the nine and then second and goal on the three,
Lafayette was unable to score in the next three plays.
On fourth down and three to go, the Leopards tried
an end sweep, a play that has been very successful
against the 'Cats this year. The runner was met by a
wall of seven Davidson defenders before the referee -
could blow his whistle. wl

TRICKY DICK LAYS IT UP

Wildcats Prep For Roundball Season

Harriers Finally
End Long Season

The Davidson cross country
squad, posting a disappointing
2-5 record for the season closed
out the year seventh in a field
of eight in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament at West
Virginia Monday.

“Our record is certainly noth-
ing to brag about,’’ commented.
Coach Heath Whittle. ‘But the
boys worked very hard this year
and I'm proud of their effort.”

Team captain Andy Little re-
ceived an Honorable Mention
fram the All-Conference team.
Remarked Little, ‘I might have
made the All-Conference team
if I had not made such a poor
showing at the Southern Con-
ference Tournament.

“Cold air was our biggest ob-
stacle at the conference tour-
ney” said Little: “I had good
position and felt fine for the
first mile, but after that the cold
air got to my lungs. It really
made a difference.”’ Little plac-
ed 22nd to lead the Davidson
entries.

Next year Coach Whittle will
again be faced with an inexper-
ienced squad. Little is a senior,
and two sophmores, Bobby My-
ers and Jim McLaughlin, plan to
study in Europe next year. Whit-
tle hopes to build a team from
the freshmen. The yearlings, led
by Mike Moats, Randy Phillips
and Ed Kopp, chalked up a 3-4
record,
