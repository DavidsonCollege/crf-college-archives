Jesus Christ Superstar
will be performed at

Davidson

By Setu Davis
Arts & Living Editor

With two weeks left to production, Judas was
leaping up and down the stage, his cries punctu-
ated by the wild tossing about of his arms. Once
the scene ended, Jesus Christ Superstar director
Chase Bringardner smiled, his arms quite silent
and crossed over his chest. Judas (Austin Rios)
certainly had a lot of energy. From my vantage
point in the center of Love Auditorium, that en-
ergy certainly seemed to be coming together in the
whole cast.

My first introduction to the inner-workings
of theater came the night I sat in on a rehearsal of
the upcoming performance of Jesus Christ Super-
star. I sat down in one of the seats in Love
Auditorium and watched as the cast circled up and
proceeded to “zap!” at each other emphatically.
Bringardner led the cast through a series of exer-
cises that, while a little like Rios’s leaping perfor-
mance, focused the group’s energy. I was enter-

_tained by that energy, so, when they began to
rehearse some of the most emotionally charged
scenes of the musical, I was quite ready to see their
new production of Jesus Christ Superstar.

By all appearances, opening night of the
Davidson student production of this powerful
musical should be a charged one. The musical’s
story is based upon the final few days of Jesus
Christ’s life. Containing the: compositions of
Andrew Lloyd Webber, Jesus Christ Superstar
presents a very unique rendition of the Christ tale.
In its uniqueness, it goes beyond a simple re-

telling of the Gospel, and is, instead, a tale that
stands strongly in its own right. Can one go
wrong combining rock and the Bible? Cer-
tainly, with Superstar, it seems that the answer
is “no.”

Having seen the movie production of the
musical, I sat in my seat in Love with a great
deal of anticipation as the cast began to rehearse
some of the most powerful scenes. Peter (Justin
Perkinson) and Mary (Anna McDonald) came
on stage and performed their ballad beautifully.
The two harmonized and, with simple move-
ments and facial gestures, brought me far from
my seat in Love and into the power of the
musical.

One of the most emotional and compel-
ling numbers in the whole musical is Judas’
death scene. In the movie version that I saw,
Judas’ fiery challenge to God made goose-
bumps raise on my ‘arms. I also had goose-
bumps watching the rehearsal of the scene in
Love. Rios brought that same fire to Judas, and
kneeling with his hand raised, contrasted with
the equally moving rendition of Peterand Mary’s
ballad by McDonald and Perkinson.

Jesus Christ Superstar has quite a cast
assembled for this production. Unfortunately I
can not name each and every one of the huge
group, but I must say, from seeing some of the
dance numbers and mob scenes, no one is
lacking in energy. If everything comes to-
gether, as I think it will, then this production
simply should not be missed,

The musical will be peformed in Love
Auditorium on Thursday, April 15th; at 8:00
pm, Friday, April 16th at 4:30 pm, Saturday,
April 17th at 8:00 pm, and Sunday, April 18th,
at 2:00 pm.
