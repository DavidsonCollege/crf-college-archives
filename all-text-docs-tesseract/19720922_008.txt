Men Experiment

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

Davidson is now conducting
its first experiment in residency
living with 13 members of the
Senior Class as the par-
ticipants.

Situated in Grey House, the
group is comprised mostly of
hall counselors from last year
and others who have been both
active in campus affairs and
who share mutual interests.

Even though the 13 selected
were done so on very special
considerations, the emphasis is
not a closed society living in an
exclusive environment.

Richard Clay, one of the
members and originators of the
project, feels that ‘if the group
ever got to be thought of as an
eletist organization, I'd quit the
program altogether.”

The plan involves choosing
a general topic of both national
and campus concern at the
beginning of the year, and
giving specific weekly assign-
ments to different members of
the group.

It will be the job of each to
research his topic and ask in-
terested members of the faculty
to participate in the weekly
discussions.

In addition, special in-
vitations will be given to selec-
ted freshman halls, as well as a
general invitation to the com-
munity.

In this way, freshmen will be
given a chance to participate
more fully in campus life and to
meet more upperclassmen and
faculty members on an _ in-
formal basis.

‘‘We hope that this program
will be educational as well as
social,’ said group member
Larry Duncan.

The 13 members also hope to
get an interested faculty ad-
visor willing to attend the
weekly seminars and promote
the idea to the rest of the faculty
at large.

It is also hoped that the
program will serve not only to
involve the entire campus in
relevant discussion, but to ser-
ve as a model for other dor-
mitory living procedures both
now and in the future.

This last idea is a particular
interest of both Dean of Stu-
dents Will H. Terry and Scotty
Nichols, Director of Student
Housing and project supervisor.

(Continued from p. 2)
sequently the housing office un-
derestimated the numbeg of
rooms that would be needed by
women students. Forty-six are
living on the top two floors of
Little, two are commuting from
Statesville, another is living in
the town of Davidson, and at the
last minute the college decided
to put eight coeds in a former
faculty residence on Main
Street.

Generally the coeds have
been pleased by Davidson so
far, but they do have a few com-
plaints. Katie Early, a transfer
junior from Queens said, ‘‘The
orientation activities have been
geared towards men, and
Davidson was not really
prepared for women."’ However
she also said, ‘‘Davidson is bet-
ter than I the-:ght it would be. I
enjoyed my two years at
Queens, but I wish I could have
four years at Davidson.”

“Do you guys ever sleep?”
asked Mary Hobbie, a transfer
junior from Goucher. She and
the other coeds interviewed
have been annoyed by men who
have wandered about their halls
at 2 a.m. knocking on their
doors and having waterfights.
All five coeds interviewed said
they wanted their halls closed to
men during certain hours.

Yet all the women em-
phasized they didn't want their
prolems made into a “big
deal,’ for as Eleanor Mac-
grudger an exchange coed from
Sweet Briar said,‘‘I really like
it here. Everybody's sonice.”’

Revisions In Custodial System

Aim For Improved Efficvency

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

In an effort to increase ef-
ficiency and reduce costs
related to the Davidson
custodial system, a number of
changes will take place this fall.

The basic change is that one
custodian will no longer be
assigned to a particular floor.
Instead, Physical Plant Direc-
tor Grover C. Meetze, Jr. has
coordinated a system of team
assignments involving
custodians and maids.

Custodians will work as a
team to maintain floors,
showers, etc. The present plan
will also use maids to clean
rooms weekly.

Robert J. Stephenson, direc-

tor of personnel and ad-
ministrative services, ex-
plained that the new

arrangement will result in afive
per cent savings in wages paid
to maintain the dormitories
over last year's costs.

The number of personnel slots
was reduced by not replacing
retiring custodians and by tran-
sferring certain custodians to
other stations on the campus.

Personnel that did not choose
to become part of the team ef-
fort were aided by college of-
ficials in securing new jobs in
industry, according to Stephen-
son.

“With this change a transition
period is expected as employees
become accustomed to new
routines,” said Meetze. “‘We
are looking forward to student
cooperation since some of the
custodians and maids are new
to the campus."

While Meetze stated that it is
too early to appraise the merits
of the new system, he expressed

hope that both students and em-
ployees would forward *‘feed-
back" to him.

Sarah White. a Little Dor-
mitory maid, commented,
“I think it's gonna be a good
system, unless the men decide
that we're driving them too
hard. Everyone knows that
women work much harder than
men.”
