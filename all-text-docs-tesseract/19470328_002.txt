With the last issue of the Dazvidsonian

which the old editor puts out before turn-|

ing over the reigns to the new staff and
new editor, it is customary to look back
over the year through rose-colored glasses,
close with compliments to everybody, and
cemark what a wonderful year it has been
tegardless of what has been said or done.
This course would he an easy one to fol-
low, for there is even evidence that perhaps
this year has not been any worse than
others: in 1939 Bill Marquess had this to
say in closing. “Of course it would never
do for any student to openly exhibit any
regard for the paper, or to do other than
gtipe about it at every available opportuni-
ty, but we have recejyed a great many help-
ful critisms, lettefs to the editor, and com-
pliments, which’at least show that the stu-
‘dent body is aware of the existence of a
weekly publication on the campus!”
But I believe that this year” has been
; worse than others. Evidence to this fact
‘can be seen in the recent election, in which
_ the editors could find only three men quali
* fied to run for this office.

POSSIBLE REMEDY

Realizing that practically everyone who

_ has anything at all to do with publications
has attempted to diagnose the situation
this year, and~at the risk of ~being trite
, and not read, I offer my solution to the
. problem for the Davidsonian. It has been
Suggested to me from the office of one of
our other “frantic attempts to get out a
publication” (not Swink’s — he’s in worse
shape than that) a possible reason for the
excessive: lack of interest exhibited this
year. This is that men below the editor
do not have any responsibility placed on
‘them,, nor do they receive suitable recogni-
tion-for the-work that they do; when any

editor be in charge of each issue, with the
editor turning over to him as much of the
responsibility and management as possible.
It there were only three men capable of
such responsibility, perhaps the editor
could not expect to turn over too much
to them as the burden would be too great
with their turn coming up every third
week: But if there were six men as there
should be, the editor could expect to leave
a great deal in their hands. But in either
case a considerable burden would be re-

moved fromthe editor,

For recognition, each time perhaps in
the masthead it could be shown who was
the head managing editor for that issue.
In. this way some competifion might be a-
roused to see who could put out the best
issue. And it would give the student body
something more tangible to vote on when
elections came around as they would have
actual proof of who had done a good job
and who had not. The editor, meanwhile;
could assume a position of general super-
vision in stead of spending most of his time
doing the actual work. A good paper can
never be had until there is someone in this
position. An example of what this would
mean is that a paper could be sent to press
in which more than 10% of the material
in it has been proof read.

THE OLD SYSTEM
Under the old system before the war
ithere were five managing editors’ and a
|sports editor. The managing editors were

‘entrusted with a page apiece as by some

|miraculous means they seemed to get out

|six pages quite regularly. The managing

Of course the sports editor was résponsi-

‘lack of interest on the part of the under-
/classmen or improper approach on the part

| APPRECIATION

| In closing I do not wish to convey the
‘impression that [ have not enjoyed work-
ing on the paper this year, for I would
hardly have been doing it were it not en-
joyable. This is merely an attempt to of fer
a solution for future editors that they may
not find the job taking more time than
they can afford to spend. I want to ex-
press my thanks to Ed Sutton for giving
me the opportunity to edit the last few
issues, and to wish him the best of luck on
the coming examinations. I want also to
especially thank Bob Phillips, Gopher
Mann, Sam Ervin, Ronny Dietrick, and
Stan Kenneth, who have done more than
their share of the work, and without whom

This column is meant to be the
first movement in an endorsement
to make one Gus- Travis (need we
say who he is?), popular daily
columnist in a Charlotte paper, the
Davidsonian’s choice for Man of the
Year. It is to be expected that a
chorus of whys will arise from the
unfortunate readers of this corner,
to all of which I may put this an-
swer in the form of a question:
Have you ever tried to write a
newspaper column eyery week, not
io mention every day? To give
any luckily uninitiated readers the
answer to this query, we shall en-
deavor to set forth in the follow-
ing paragraphs the woes of a col-
lege columnist and dedicate them
to the memories of those gone be-
fore (R. I. P.)

lessly, tossing and turning and
racking his brain for the ideas that
never seem to come. Monday night,
after he has turned his” neatly
typed 50 lines of accumulated drivel
he can sleep fairly well after emit-
ting several anticipatory shudders
at the thought of the repeating
process to come. Wednesday and
Thursday nights, things begin to

the journalist, and his head is con
tinually pivoting so that he won't
miss a single thing that might be
happening. He intentionally bumps
into every group standing around
bulling in the hope that he might
snatch up a scrap worth repeating,
He will give a dollar to get in on
funny accident that might
him a lead, and he is often caught
in the act of creating one so as to
lend authenticity to his mumblings.
Once in a great while he happens
to come across something and
promises himself he will jot it down
at the first opportunity. Of course,
he forgets his resolution and curses
himself generously when he realizes
what he has done. Thus he drags

with the madness of Monday con-
fronting him every week with not
a trace of an idea in his feeble
cranium,

All day he turns away in revul-
sion from the task that faces him,
always telling himself that he has
to finish up a lot of other work
before, for it is easy to see that
journalists are the greatest pro-
crastinators in the world. Monday
night after supper he drags him-
self down into a chair before the
big black typewriter containing the
sickeningly blank sheet of white
paper. He industriously raps out
the title anl author and then leans
back for a smoke to consider what
it’s going to be. Half an hour later
he is back from next door where
he has explored the learned depths
of “Li’l Abner” and “Blondie” much
to the edification of his eager mind
but little to, the progress of his
erudite composition. He throws
himself upon his bed to think with
Wis eyes closed since he has found
that the said position is highly con-
ducive to relaxation and thought.
Well, at least to the former, he
thinks, as he stretches and yawns,
then goes back to his machine re-
freshed from an hour’s nap. He
makes a futile stab at a few drab

“THE OUTLAW”

According to Time Magazine the
horse, “Red,” steals the show away
from sexy Jane Russell as “Rio”
the “Half-bred Moron” and Jack
Buetel as “Billy the Kid.” How-
ever Walter Huston (Doc) and
Thomas Mitchell (Pat Jarrett)
hand in swell performances. The
plot: Doc comes to town to find
Pat has . gone straight and is now
the sheriff. The Kid has stolen
Doc’s horse, Red, and is wounded
by Pat but Doc takes him to “Rio's”
house where she nurses him back
to health with such as climbing
into bed with him as there is a
scarcity of blankets. Well it all
ends with the Kid and Rio riding
off together astride Red, the horse.

When the Hayes office, the Lily
White League of movieland, ob-
jected to the Kid’s line, “You bor-
rowed from me; now I borrowed
your gal,” Howard Hughes, the
producer changed the line to “Tit
for tat.” Hastily the Hayes com-
bine agreed the first version was
the better.

the excellent cast of Robert Mont-

gomery, Ingrid Bergman, and
George Sanders. It concerns a

young Englishman suffering from
paranois who escapes from a sani-
tarium and returns home. He mar-
ries his mother’s secretary and soon
accuses her of carrying on an af-
faire with his best friend. His
fear of losing his life drives him
to commit suicide. He does this
job as, cunningly as to involve his
friend that the latter is sentenced
to be hung. However Ingrid comes
to the rescue in the nick of. time.
The title for this picture comes
from “heaven has no greater rages
than love to hatred turned.”

KAPPA ALPHA

Night of Knights was last Satur-
day evening when the lads of Sigma
Chapter dined and danced at Morris
Field Officers’ Club. Festivities
began with a delicious buffet meal
served in the gaily decorated din-
ing room. Highlights of the ban-
quet was an expose of one of
Brother Glasgow’s amorous war let-
ters to his B. J. B. and several witty
poems read by the dates of the
“Indicited” ones.

Sweet music flowed from the in-
struments of Billy Knauff’s orches-
tra and the only complaint was that ~
the dance had to stop at midnight.
Several alumni and wives were on
hand, including Dean and Mrs.
Bailey, Dr. and Mrs. McGavock,
Mr. and Mrs. Payne. A visitirg
brother from Rho chapter, U.S. C.,
was DuPre Lyles.

Sponsors “for the functior. were:
Miss Virginia Harris with Brother
Jackson; Miss. Kay Réves with
Brother “Bone”; “Miss Gerry
Ervin with Brother’ Barnwell;
Miss George Ann Robertson with
“Cuns’l” Whitesides; and Miss
Nancy Commander with Brother
Dunn. All committefs operated
effectively to make tiis one the
“best yet.” :

In case you haven’t seen the re-
cently renovated inte‘ior of the
“Red Cross” house, dr@ over some
time—but wear your «ark glasses,
Brother Spillman and ais commit-
tee deserve a note of thanks for
their fine work.
