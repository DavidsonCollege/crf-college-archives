List Grad Study
For U.S. Students

Five of Britain's leading univer-
sitics are offering places to Ameri-
can graduate students in this year’s
summer school program. The
courses are offered in subjects for.
which the universities are concerned
—Birmingham, London, Notting-
ham, Oxford and St. Andrews—
are recognized as authorities.

The courses are intended chief-
ly for teachers, post-graduate stu-
dents and other qualified men and
women, but are also open to un-
dergraduate students in their senior
year. The cost, including tuition,
meals and residence, ranges from

$168 to $201.60.

Through the generosity of an
anonymous British donor who has
given a sum of money for Angtio-
American cultural relations, a
small number ef free trans-Atlantic
passages will be provided for
American students attending the
summer schools in Britain during
1952. In addition, the participating
universities are offering a limited
number of grants to cover part of
the accommodation and _ tuition
fees.

The courses offered include:
Shakespeare and Elizabethan Dra-
ma (University of Birmingham),
July 5-August 16, 1952, to be held
at Shakespeare's birthplace, Strat-
ford-on-Avon; Problems of Britain's
Economic Recovery (University of
London), July 14-August 22, 1952,
to be held at the London School of
Economics and Political Science;

For Draft Tests

Major General Lewis B. Hershey, director of Selective Serv-
ice, today reminded college students that applications for the
April 24 Selective Service Qualification Test. must be post-
marked not later than midnight March 10.

National headquarters estimates
that upward to 100,000 will make
application to take the April 24
test. This will be the last test given
during the current academic year.

Application blanks may be
obtained by students from the
nearest local board, They do
not have to return home to the
local board which has juris-
diction over them. Davidson
men may obtain blanks from
Professor Olin Puckett.

To be eligible to take the Selec-
tive Service Qualification Test, an
applicant, on the testing date (1)
must be a selective service regis-
trant who intends to request de-
ferment as a student (2) must be
satisfactorily pursuing a- full-time
college . course—undergraduate or
graduate—leading to a degree; (3):
must not previously have taken the
test.

The criteria for consideration for
deferment as a student at the pres-
ent time is either a score of 70 or
better on the Selective Service Col-
lege Qualification Test or class
standing among the male members
in the upper half of the freshman
class, upper two thirds of the soph-
omore class or upper three fourths
of the junior class. Seniors® ac-'
cepted for admission to a graduate
school satisfy the criteria it they
are among the upper half of the
male members of their senior class,’
or they make a score of 75 or bet-
ter.

Students already enrolled in
graduate schools may be con-
sidered for deferment so long
as they remain in good stand-
ing.

These criteria are guides for the
local boards. The local boards are
under nocompulsion to follow
them,

Many students have been
confused in differentiating be-
between the 1-S and 2-S defer-
ments.

The 2-S deferment is considered
on the basis of class standing or
qualification test and is discretion-
ary on the part of the loca! board.
It may be granted by the local

board each successive year, thus
enabling students who continue to
meet the criteria to complete their
education,

The I-S deferment, on the other
hand, is provided for by the law.
A college student ordered to report
for induction while he is satisfac-
torily pursuing a full-time course
is entitled to this I-S deferment
until he finishes his academic year
provided he has not had his induc-
tion postponed or been deferred as
a student prior to June 19, 1982.
He may be given but one such de-
ferment and it is incumbent upon
hin to notify his local board of his
status when he receives the order
to report for induction. .

On. January t, 1952, there were
1,258,735 male college students be-
tween the ages of 184% and 26.

The selective service status of
these students was as follows:

Number of students with

statutory 1-S deferment to

end of academic year--.. 11,857
Number of students with

2-S deferments as a result

of class standing or test

Many of these 367,735 cannot be
inducted into the -service because
they are members of the National
Guard or organized Reserves and
approximately 40 per cent of the
remainder will probably fail to meet
the minimum physical and mental
standards,

Weather Service
Pays In Future

Air Weather Service training has
paid off in dollars and cents for
many former U. S. Air Force
weathermen who have returned to
civilian life to enter one of the
many varied meteorological fields,
according to a recent statement by
retary of the American Meteorolog-
ical Society.

Increased interest in the field of
meterology has come about as a
result of the recent announcement

in April, Students interested

should see the PMS&T person-

ally by that time.

Although the matter has not been
discussed as yet with the Executive
Committee, it is felt that authori-

zation by that group will be made in

| the direction of excused cuts.

by Air Force headquarters that 3300
college graduates with credit for
one year of college physics and
mathematics through integral cal-
culus will receive immediate
USAF commissions as second lieu-
tenants to enter a 12-month course
of weather training this fall.

Commenting on the subject of
“Civilian Careers in Meteorology,”
Mr, Spengler quoted information
and experience.

Aside from the obvious opportu-
‘nities at the U. S. Weather Bureau
and the major airlines, other areas
of employment have claimed Air
Weather Service “graduates.” Many
meteorologists have gone into busi-
ness for themselves, establishing
weather consultant services in va-
rious parts of the United States, to
which industry and business can
bring their weather problems.
