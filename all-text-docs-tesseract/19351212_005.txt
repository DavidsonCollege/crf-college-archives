Rumors of a Military Court-Martial
on the campus were fully confirmed late
this afternoon by a report from Head-
quarters of the Davidson Battalion, Re-
serve Officers’ Training Corps.

The name of the accused, a member of
“B” company, has not yet been made
public. Officials have kept all investi-
gations secret and the details were not
made public until today.

Members of the prosecution have
charged the accused with stealing one .45
calibre pistol, value about twenty-five
dollars, the property of the United
States, and also with willful disobedience
of orders.

The members of the court are: Cap-
tain J. W. Hassell, Trial Judge-Advo-
cate; Capt. W. C. Branton, Defense
Counsel; Capt. J. H. Ross, Law Mem-
ber; Capt. J. M. Hodgin, Capt. I. C.
Wooten, Ist Lt. A. A. Kuhn, Asst. Trial
Judge-Advocates; Ist Lt. R. P. Morrow,
Asst. Defense Counsel; Major C. L.
Windham, Ist Lt. M. J. Barnett, Ist Lt.
T. E. Downie, 1st Lt. D. B. Griffin, 1st
Lt. W. R. Taber, 2nd Lt. W. M. Beaty,
2nd Lt. Cassels, 2nd Lt. J. H. Morrow,
2nd Lt. J. R. Pearce, 2nd Lt. A. W.
Price, 2nd Lt. L. T. Purnell, 2nd Lt.
D. M. Stewart.

This trial_is the culmination of a six-
weeks’ course in Military Law given to
all seniors taking R.O.T.C. Last year’s
victim was Gordon Wood.

Justice in military circles is obtained
through Court Martial. The 104th Article
of War grants disciplinary power of a
very mild form to commanding officers.
There is a Summary Court Martial
which can give as maximum punishment
one month at hard labor and forfeiture
of two-thirds of one month’s pay. ‘The
Special Court Martial, consisting of not
less than three officers, may not give
more than six months confinement and
hard labor and two thirds loss of six
months’ pay. The most powerful is the
General Court Martial'that has a power
to condemn a man to death,

Pen Manufacturers Warns Public
Razor-Blades Using Name

The following has been brought to the
attention of the DAVIDSONIAN statt
by the Parker Pen Company, one of our
advertisers. We are glad to cooperate
with them in an effort to keep our read-
ers from being deceived by this misrep-
resentation.

The Parker Pen Company is success-
fully taking drastic steps to stamp out
a current “racket’’ which

are not. Commonly, the advertising takes
form that ostensibly the
“free gift” of the fountain pen with the
purchase of a 49c package of the so-
called “Parker New Blades.”

In this campaign against this racket,
The Parker Pen Company has recently
secured injunctions in a Federal Court
against certain concerns and individuals
who promote the scheme by supplying
the razor blades and the cheap pens to
be sold in such “Deals.”

Also it has prosecuted,’in States from
California to South Carolina, individual
hawkers of the “Deals” and enjoined
them.

In the last-mentioned case, the injune-
tion restrains the defendants and_ their
agents from “directly or indirectly in
fringing upon the plaintiff's (The Parker
Pen Company) trademark’ ‘Parker’ and
from unfairly competing with or contrib-
uting to unfair competition with plaintiff
through razor blade and fountain
“Deals” otherwise; and especially
from using the mark ‘Parker’ or any
colorable imitation thereof in any man-
ner or form upon razor blades or con-
tainers thereof or in any connection with
the sale thereof.”

Retailers are requested to notify The
Parker Pen Company promptly if any
concern or individual approaches them in
the promotion of any such “Deal.” Parker
will appreciate also the name of the sales
person or concern involved, and his or
its address.
