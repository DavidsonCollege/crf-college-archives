THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 11, 1934

Frat Houses Receive
New Coats of Paint

Various Other Improvements Are
Also Being Made

Superintendent of Grounds F. D.
Hobart announced today that the first
coat of paint had been applied to all
the houses in Fraternity Court and that
a second coating would follow imme-
diately.

Five students and one painter with
previous experience are working on the
project, which is expected to require
several weeks to complete. The esti-
mated cost of painting the fraternity
houses is two hundred and fifty dollars.

After painting the houses, the roofs
of Dormitory Row will be treated with
a special weather-proof paint.

In addition to the painting projects
the campus is being improved gener-
ally. To date, approximately seventy-
five per cent of the campus trees have
been trimmed by expert tree surgeons
and about fifty trees along Maple Row
have been treated with fertilizer.

Davidson Debaters
Defeat Opponents

Virginians Before Large
Crowd

Davidson debaters were opposed by
a team from Washington and Lee on
the night of Wednesday, the 28th of
March. Taking the affirmative, repre-
sented by Skip Brown and Rawling
Pratt-Thomas, Davidson won the de-
cision by a vote of two to one. The
subject under discussion was, “Re-
solved, that the President of the
United States should have his powers
substantially increased.”

The debate was held in Chambers
Auditorium at 8 o'clock before the
largest crowd in four years, A large
number of townspeople were present in
addition to student and faculty mem-
bers. Ed Humphrey presided. Judges

own record for the discus and Earle
Frazier setting a new Davidson record
for the mile, the Wildcat track team
defeated the University of Richmond
tracksters on Richardson Field Satur-
day by the score of 74-52. The ’Kitten
track team, however, went down be-
fore the Richmond freshmen, 85-31.

Cochran threw the plate 138 feet,
4% inches and Frazier took the mile
in 4 minutes, 38.1 seconds, to break
by .7 seconds the record set by Soup
Brannon two years ago.

Evans took Davidson high scoring
honors for the day, winning firsts in
the 100 and 220-yard dashes and third
in the 220-yard low hurdles.

Starring for Richmond was Chal-
tain, who took firsts ‘in the broad
jump and the 120-yard high hurdles
and a second in the 220-yard low
hurdles. In the long runs Davidson
particularly starred, Frazier, Morrow
and Shuford taking all three places in
the mile run, Gullette and Glass run-
ning off with first and second in the
two-mile, and Frazier and Oakes tak-
ing first and second in the 880,

In a meet punctuated by short rains,
both teams turned in some excellent
performances. Lee and Pittman, in-
spired by the skill of Richmond pole
vaulters, tied for first in the vault,
going 11 feet, 6 inches short of the
Davidson record.

Dickson was the only star of the
‘Kittens’ outclassed performance. He
took first in the 100-yard dash and,
after breaking a toe and placing sec-
ond in the 120-yard high hurdles, took
first in the high jump. Honors for
the Richmond frosh are divided be-
tween Cohen, Brown and Lumpkin.

— what it means

Everything that Science knows
about is used in making Chesterfields.

One thing we do is to buy mild,
ripe tobaccos and then lock up these to-
baccos in modern storage warehouses
to age and mellow like rare wines.

It takes about 3 years to age the
tobaccos for your Chesterfield, for

— to store
/O million dollars

worth of tobacco

ie 4s : miles of : warehouses

Time does something to tobacco that

the cigarette that TASTES BETTER

neither man nor machine can do.

It means something to keep 70
million dollars worth of tobacco in
storage. It means just this:

We do everything possible
to make Chesterfield the

cigarette that’s milder, the
cigarette that tastes better.
