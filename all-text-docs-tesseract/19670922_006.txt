NEW YORK — Who is the
student activist—the collegi-
an who demonstrates or or-
ganizes for civil rights.
against the draft or the Viet-
nam war, or for more student
freedom?

Psychologists and social
scientists, operating indepen-
dently on vuaiious campuses
and with varying research
methods. agree on this por-
trait:

Activists as a group are
more intelligent. less preju-
diced and_ psychologically
more stable than nonactiv-

ists. Religion is not important
to them, but social issues are,
particularly those that do not
involve their own direct per-
sonal interests.

Most activists come from
relatively affluent middle-
class liberal Democratic fam-
ilies. Their parents tend to
be highly educated. come
from recent immigrant stock,
are permissive in child-rear-
ing and have closer effective
relationships with their chil-
dren than the parents of non-
activists.

Many Are Jewish
A disproportionately high
number of activists are Jew-
ish. Very few are Roman
Catholic.
Activists are slightly less

alienated than nonactivists,
and no more in rebellion
against parental ideas and
authority than the rest of the
student body. (‘‘Hippies’’ and
“beats’’—the fully alienated
students and nonstudents with
whom the activists are often
confused—are found to be in
rebellion against parents,
particularly their fathers.)

Referring to eight studies
done at the University of Cal-
ifornia at Berkeley, the Uni-
versity of Chicago and Penn-
sylvania State University,
Dr. Joseph Katz of the Insti-
tute for Study of Human
Problems at Stanford Uni-

versity said:

“The amazing fact is that

‘New Action Union’ Plans

More Fall Flicks, Hungry d

By ED EMBREE
Managing Editor

Programs ranging from the
return of the Fine Films Se-
ries to an expansion of the
Hungry-d Restaurant are in-
cluded in the fall schedule of
B. A. Aiken's ‘‘New Action
Union." .

The College. Union has re-
sumed this year its Fine
Films program including ma-
jor motion pictures from
throughout, the world. Calle
Mayor, a Spanish film, will
initiate the series September
28 followed by Eclipse, an
Italian film directed by Mi.
chelangelo Antonioni, on Oc-
tober 26. ;

A French movie written by
Jean Cocteau. Les infants
Terribles, will be shown No-
vember 30 and on January 4
the Russian film. A Ballad
of Love, and an experimental
film, Lot in Sodom, will be
shown.

John Liipfert. chairman of
the Union Coffee House
(UCH) committee, plans to
include professional enter-
tainment in his schedule of
six performances this semes-
ter. He also said that he
hopes to exchange talent with
area schools for some pro-
grams.

bership would be open. Fees,
Anderson said, would be
equivalent to a fraternity’s
dues and board.

The club hoped last spring
for a new house somewhere
on the campus. but in light
of expenses—Workman said
a new furnished house would
cost about $10,000—the facul-
ty committee recommmend-
ed renovating Lingle Manor.

“Later on. if things work-
ed well. we could build,’ he
said.

“I definitely think there is
room .on this campus for both
restricted groups and open
groups,’ Workman said. “For
some, a campus club would
meet their needs far better
than a fraternity with its rit-
ual, exclusiveness and fol-
derol.”

A small mixer with Sullins
and Sacred Heart for Octo-
ber 7 has been added to the
fall entertainment schedule,
said Charles Cameron. Union
social chairman. Cameron is
also working closely with the
Social Council. in planning
after-parties, late-night in-
formal concerts and break-
fasts for Homecoming and
the two concert weekends this
semester. The annual Union
Christmas Party will be held
December 14 and feature
“The Fabulous Five’ com-
bo.

Jens Bjerre will present a
film-lecture program on Red
China October 27 as part of
the Union Travel Committee's
program. Tom Alison, chair-
man of this committee. has
also planned a film-lecture
on skiing for November 15 as
well as a skiing trip this win-
ter and a trip to the Bahamas
for spring vacation.

Among some of Andy
Clay's ‘‘great all-time flicks”
for this semester are Moll
Flanders, Georgy Girl, Von
Ryan’s Express, Sink The
Bismarck and The Trip.

“The Pickle Brothers.’ a
Marx - brothers type comic
trio with experience on the
Ed Sullivan Show and Kraft
Summer Music Hal}, are slat
ed for a week-long appear
ance on the first Hungry-d
the week of October 16-21.
The second Hungry-d will run
October 30-November 4 fea-
turing Leanda. This young
part-Indian folksinger was se-
lected by the State Depart-
ment to represent the U. S.
in a world competition this
summer in Poland.

The Hungry-d. brainchild
of College Union Director C.
Shaw Smith, began two years
ago as a restaurant wtih a
floor show by comedian Fred
Smoot. Working with Fred
Weintraub and Brian Sennett
of the Fredana Management
Co. in New York, several in-
terested people who work
with student activities have
expanded his original idea
into a Coffee House Circuit
including over 60 colleges and
universities.

In October. David F. Rich-
ey, assistant professor of ‘mu-
sic, and his wife will be fea-
tured in a piano and violin
concert jointly sponsored by
the Music Department and
the College Union.

The Union is also in the
process of a self-evaluation
in which ideas for new and
improved programs are be-
ing gathered from surveys,
old files. suggestions, and
professional p u bli ca tions,
said Smith. Smith added.
however. ‘Nothing  substi-

converge, that they do not
contradict each other in the
major findings.”

In a 55-page monograph
prepared for the U.S. Office
of Education and just releas-
ed, Katz wrote that student
activists ‘tend to be more
flexible, tolerant and realis-
tic: less dependent upon au-
thority, rules or rituals for
managing social relation-
ships.

“In their values. activists
tend to be concerned with
self-expression. _ intellectual
orientation, sense of com-
munity with and responsibil-
ity for their fellow men, while
the nonactivists tend to be
more success-oriented, self:
denying. conventional, com-

petitive, self-controlled, fore-
sighted and orderly.”

He added that findings of
close emotional and intellec-
tual ties between activists
and their parents ‘“‘put into
question. the ‘“‘conflict-be-
tween - generations’ theory
that has been advanced as
one explanation of the activ-
ity protest.” ,

Dr. Kenneth Keniston, pro-
fessor of psychology at Yale
University writes in an ar-
ticle prepared for a forth-
coming issue of the Journal
of Social Issues: ‘‘The higher
the student’s grade average.
the more outstanding his ac-
ademic achievements, the
more likely it is that he will
become involved in any giv-

en political demonstration.”

He said that parents of stu-
dent portesters include large
numbers of liberal Democrats
plus an unusually large scat-
tering of pacifists and social-
ists. If the parents are relig-
ious. he added, they tend to
be connected with the more
liberal denominations such
as Unitarianism, reform Ju-
daism or the Religious So-
ciety of Friends (Quakers).

The high Jewish represen.
tation. also noted by Kenis-
ton, was ascribed by many
researchers to a Jewish tra-
dition of high sociat and in-
tellectual commitment.

In his study of a Univer.
sity of Chicago sit-in involv-
ing class ranking and the
draft. a sociologist found that

grandparents as well as par-
ents of protesters were dis-
proportionately highly educat-
ed and not new arrivals to
high social status, compared
with families of nonactivists.
“Socially Fortunete”’

Commenting on this and
other studies, Keniston
wrote: ‘

“In brief. activists are not
drawn from disadvantaged.
status-anxious, underprivileg-
ed or uneducated groups. On
the contrary, they are selec-
tively recruited from among
those young Americans who
have had the most socially
fortunate upbringing.”

Surveys varied on the ques-
tion of participation of Re-
publican students. One study
found no Republicans at all

eral, Affluent Family

in a Chicago sample, while
the study at Berkeley found
that 13 per cent of demon-
strators were conservative
Republicans and 10 per cent
liberal Republicans.

Activists tend to be a smal!
minority even on the most
protest-prone campus. Nev-
ertheless, researchers report
that they have a wide im-
pact.

Studies show that activists
tend to study the humanities,
particularly the social sci-
ences, and to avoid career-
oriented education. particu-
larly business and engineer-
ing. Activists are depicted as
flexible, antidogmatic, demo-
cratic and relatively unim-
pressed with personal
achievement.

Davidson World Premiere Site
For Professor’s New Concerto

Davidson College will be-
come the site of a world pre-
miere this winter as music
professor Wilmer Welsh pre-
sents his new “Concerto for
Voice and Orchestra” in Jan-
uary.

Weish’s most recent con-
certo uses the solo voice as
if it were another instrument
in the-orchestra.

“This is truly a virtuoso
piece,’’ said Welsh of the first
movement. “The soloist must
sing continuously for almost
the entire 30 minutes of the
piece. It is very taxing.”

The composer has written
the concerto especially for
Miss Ilona Kombrink, whom
he met in Charlotte last year
at the premiere of his ora-
torio “Joseph,"’ in which Miss
Kombrink soloed.

Miss Kombrink, a member
of the music faculty of the
University of Wisconsin,
again will be featured as the
soloist with the Chicago Lit-
tle Symphony at the January
premiere. Thor Johnson, di-

tutes for the student or pro-
fessor who has positive. but
unexpressed ideas and sug-
gestions."

When asked about the af.
fect of the Union's physical
plant on the program, Smith
replied. ‘Because of the ef-
fective coordination between
the Union Board and the So-
cial Council and the fact that

everyone is working hard as’

a tight group. we have a
bang-up program despite the
inadequacies of our present
facilities.

GEORGE BROWN

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Assistant Managing Editor

“I think the President and
Dean Rusk are wrong, and I
have a right to say so,” said
Democratic Representative
George E. Brown to an ap-
plauding student body in as-
sembly yesterday.

“Both of them were
wrong,” he commented, this
time referring to former Sec-
retary of State John Foster
Dulles and Secretary of State
Dean Rusk,’’ and we're pay-
ing the price of it, to the tune
of 100 thousand American
casualties.”

Academy of Music, will con-
duct the Little Symphony.

Like ‘‘Joseph.”’ the concer-
to has a Biblical background.
taken from the Song-of Solo-
man. Welsh agrees with Bib-
lical scholars who interpret
the Song of Solomon as either
a wedding song or a mystical
expression. The music. there-
fore, may either have sexual
connotations or be interpret-
ed as a mystical union be-
tween God and the soul.
Welsh prefers that the latter
interpretation apply to his
work.

“TI see the soul as passive,

therefore feminine.” says
Welsh. ‘In the first move-

ment the soul becomes aware
of the presence of God but
doesn't know how to get
through to union with him.
Thus there is a: feeling of
tension and a sense of incom-
pletion.”

The second movement com
pletes the unity with a se
ries of “‘ostinatos’’ or repeti-
tive drives in a rhythmical
pattern.

The third and final move-
ment begins. ‘What is your
beloved more than another
beloved. oh fairest of wom-
en?"’

Welsh interprets this move-
ment as the attempt ‘‘to de-
scribe what union means.

There is a feeling of fulfill-

ment and ectasy, progressing

Council To Print
New Handbooks

In a special meeting today.
the Student Council voted to
publish a Student Organiza-
tion Handbook.

The 15-page pamphlet will
include the officers of vari-
ous campus organizations.
Honor Court and Student
Council members. various
committee members. the Stu-
dent Body Constitution and a
calendar of important. cam-
pus activities.

The publication. to be
known as the Student Organ-
izations Handbook. will be
financed throu gh various
sources and is designed ‘‘to
fill an information gap. espe-
cially for the freshmen.” ac-
cording to Council President
Tom Earnhardt.

Bruce Weihe, Ben Cannon
and Peter Hobbie were ap-
pointed to assemble material
for the pamphlet.

“It should be ready in
about two weeks,”’ according

LBJ,

Brown said that after the 1964
election, Johnson ‘adopted
Goldwater's policy, and Gold-
water became a peace can-
didate.”’

Elected to Congress in 1963,
from the 27th Congressional
district in California, Brown
has opposed U.S. policy in
Vietnam for three years.

Pointing to an inability and
lack of desire to fight the
war on the part of the South
Vietnamese people, he said
that the only solution would
be to totally Americanize the
war.

“The most honest people in
Vietnam are the Viet Cong,”
continued Brown as he cited
corruption within the high
command in Vietnam and the
consequently high 15 per cent
desertion rate of the troops
as reasons that Americans
will have to fight the war
alone.

The Viet Cong will execute
a man who steals a chicken,
he explained. but within the
past three years there has
been a 100 per cent turnover
in the Vietnamese generals,
who then leave for exile with
a fortune in stolen funds.

Brown attributed the cur-
rent predicament in South.
east Asia to policies formu-
lated under Dulles.

to Earnhardt.

The council also adopted to-
day a resolution to send to
the Publications Board. spec-
ifying certain changes which
should be adopted in future
editions of the Wildcat Hand-
book.

Among these changes are
an earlier date for election
of an editor. a definite dead-
line for the submission of all
copy to the editor. and a
council of publications offi-
cers, one from each major
campus organization, who
would check the copy to as-
sure that all material con-
cerning their organizations
had been submitted.

Bill Watson was appointed
to draw up the proposal. De-
tails of the changes would
be left to the Publications
Board.

The Council also approved
a new seating arrangement
for Charlotte Coliseum bas-
ketball games. It includes the
soft folding chairs on both
sides immediately behind the
teams, four similar rows on
both ends and a special sec-
tion higher up.

through a period of excite-
ment, and at the close going
through a stagnant timeless
peak.”’

As the concerto ends the
soul is prepared to meet any
earthly chagrin that may
come. The union with God is
permanent. ,

The evenly pulsating music
is accented with varying de-

grees of force.to suggest a
flow of emotions. A sense of
continuity is achieved by re-
peating the first vocalizations
of each movement at the end
with the French horn.
Welsh has rehearsed only
informally with Miss Kom-
brink. Full rehearsals with
the Little Symphony are
scheduled for this fall.

Four Professors
Cited For Service

County Commissioner
James G. Martin and three
other Davidson College pro-
fessors were cited in Char-
lotte Thursday night for their
contributions to society and
to their fields of endeavor.

Davidson College alumni in
Mecklenburg and Union coun-
ties presented plaques of ap-
preciation to Martin for his
work as chairman of the
Board of Mecklenburg Coun-
ty Commissioners; to Anth-
ony S. Abbott for his book
“Shaw and Christianity’; to

William T. Lammers for his
studies of water and of water
pollution, and to Wilmer H.
Welsh for his composition of
the oratorio “‘Joseph.”’

Martin is a member of the
college's chemistry depart.
ment; Abbott, English: Lam-
mers, biology; and Welsh,
music.

Since Welsh was unable to
attend, his wife Constance,
who wrote the liberetto for
“Joseph,” accepted the
plaque in his behalf.

Faculty, YUCA Combine
To Aid College Libraries

The Davidson College YM-
CA combined efforts with
members of the faculty last
summer to provide nearly
1,000 books for three col-
leges, two in Japan and one
in North Carolina, which

_needed larger libraries.

The project was mainly the
result of the work of Dr. Wil-
liam P. Cumming. professor
of English. Cumming had
been informed last Novem-
ber of the need for books at
a@ new women’s junior col-
lege in Seki, Japan. He was
contacted by a personal
friend, Rev. James A. McAI-
pine. a Davidson alumnus
and chairman of the board of
trustees of Seibi Gakuin, a
school in Gifu, Japan.

The school was trying to
establish a junior college
branch. The college had been
informed by Japanese author.
ities that it could not receive
accreditation unless it fulfitl-
ed a quota of 10.000 volumes
in the school library by the
fall of 1967.

McAlpine had some hope
that Cumming would be able
to help, and he was. A
few months after McAlpine's

request, Davidson's profes-
sors had to move thousands
of their own books from the
Chambers Building because
of the remodeling.

Cumming sent notices (o
the members of the faculty
asking them to donate some
of their books to Rev. Mc-
Alpine's school. He also hop-
ed at the same time to help
another Japanese college in
need, Shikoku Christian Col-
lege, as well as Barber-Sco-
tia College in Concord.

By the end of the academ-
ic year, faculty members had
donated nearly 1,000 volumes,
which Cumming and his wife
sorted for shipment. to the
three different schools.

j
t

Sunday Night Open House

The 578 books were des-
tined for the two colleges in
Japan, and several hundred
more for Barber Scotia.

The biggest problem Cum-
ming had was finding a way
to send the books to Japan.
He discovered that it would
cost over $175 to ship them
himself. But. with the aid of
the Presbyterian Church
United States Board of World
Missions, Cumming learned
of a Presbyterian women's
group in Baton Rouge. La.,
that could send the books for
only 13 cents each.

The College YMCA donated
the funds necessary to cover
the shipping costs.
