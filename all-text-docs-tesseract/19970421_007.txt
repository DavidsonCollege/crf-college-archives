Our (future) top ten

Graduates of the Class of 1947 gathered on campus last weekend to celebrate their 50th
anniversary reunion. It is likely that much has changed, anticipated or not, since their years
as undergraduates here. We thought about things we would like to see at Davidson for our
50th anniversary reunions. By 2047, we would like to see (in no particular order):

10) Tuition bills commensurate with federal rates of inflation, value of the dollar, and actual
costs incurred by the College.

9) An atmosphere that allows minority students, faculty, and staff the chance to live in the
College community, not in a fishbowl.

8) A financial aid system that awards scholastic and academic achievement as much as
athletic prowess.

7) Art that is reflective, not decorative.

6) Truly co-ed residence halls, ending the division between the sexes that endures from
orientation to graduation.

5) A comfy neighborhood bar, priced for student budgets.

4) An athletic program tailored for what Davidson is, not what it would have itself appear.
3) Professors given tenure as much for student appreciation as for departmental evaluation.
2) Next to the crosses on Chambers Lawn, Stars of David, crescents, and statues of Buddha
and Vishnu around a zen rock garden.

1) Each other.

1 am writing in response
to Eric Sapp’s latest crusade,
printed in last week’s
Davidsonian, this time com-
ing in the form of epistle.
Upon reading the letter, I was.
reminded of an argument be-
tween academics in the New
York Review of Books. One
scholar replied to the irratio-
nal, angry, and poorly-articu-
lated words of another by
beginning his response with
the caveat: “It is difficult to
argue with a scream of rage.”

And so it is. In relating
this incident, I do not meant
to equate Eric Sapp with any
sort of academia or learning.
Rather, it is meant to address
an essential irony of Mr.
Sapp’s letter.

Mr. Sapp writes angrily,
“as The Davidsonian has be-
come more opinionated and
one-sided in its ‘news’ re-
porting, I am sure that many
readers take its stories with a
grain of salt.” The editor’s
note following Sapp’s con-
demnation effectively evis-
cerates the content of his ar-

Truth ts relative

To The Editors:

gument, so I will spend no
time on that.

Even given Mr. Sapp’s
skill in literal interpretation
of text, I will excuse that
“grain of salt” comment as a
mistake. You can’t mean that
you have been taking every-
thing in the news section of
The Davidsonian as literal
truth, Mr Sapp? That would
mean you have not been read-
ing critically. I would hope
that all readers of all texts
would read them critically,
even readers of news sections.

If one expects complete
objectivity in journalism, or
any sort of writing, then one
must prepare oneself for some
serious disillusionment. Why
don’t we start with the com-
plaint voiced by Mr. Sapp? I
wonder, would Mr. Sapphave
been so angry if The
Davidsonian had printed, in
its news section, an article
stating recent findings which
point to the possibility that
Darwin was wrong about evo-
lution? Unless Mr. Sapp has
had an epiphany since the
second semester of his fresh-
man year, he would probably

be ecstatic that The
Davidsonian was finally
printing the truth. Ah, but it
would not be truth now would
‘it? The point is that truth is
relative and that is why we
read critically.
_ Eric Sapp’s letter is the
most recent and most glar-
ingly stupid of a series of
missives making comment
about the alleged
politicizition of The
Davidsonian, Ideologues and
dogmatists, like Mr. Sapp,
do not argue (and by arguing
imean using actual evidence
to support what is otherwise
conjecture) against the con-
tent of an article unless it
serves their own needs. That
is fine and to be expected.
But be sure to realize what
you are doing, Mr. Sapp, be-
cause if you beg for objectiv-
ity then you might have to
abandon those moldering
platitudes and maudlin
clichés with which you seem
to have so much facility.

Save Davidson wetlands

‘o the Editors:

I was appalled that there

as no discussion of the town
of Davidson keeping the 18
acres of pristine land it owns
along Beaty Street at the
ommissioner’s meeting this
eek. Many residents share
his concer, but were not able
0 present the point of view at
e meeting. Instead, it ap-

pears that a sale of the land to
developers is a “done deal.”

This beautiful tand
should be preserved as a vital
community resource, not to
mention a natural resource,
for our children and grand-
children. Once this natural
area is gone from our town, it
will be irreplaceable.

If the land has to be sold,
the only developer who pro-
posed to keep the entire wet-
lands pond there in tact in its
natural state was PMH Asso-
ciates/Peter Hubicki. If the

town does not keep the land
or sell it to the Nature Con-
servancy (or sell it to
Davidson College!),

I urge it to sell it to the
one willing to preserve the
largest part of the property
and the pond in its natural
state, PMH.

Yours truly,

Paul Arkton
