Decision

processes, together with the day to day duties of the

Dean and the céreful planning necessary for the Code,
Zimmermann req'iired nearly a year and a half to complete
the Code. And its final form was not only his work, but

also that of the faculty.

It is unfortunate that tenure candidates received
codifiea guidelines for tenure policy only two months
before their final evaluation. Any one who question the
decisions in their individual cases are granted the
opportunity to discuss their dismissal with the Dean of
the Faculty, according to President Spencer.

The evaiuation process ‘is still far from complete. The.
role of students in making tenure decisions is still
unclear. President Spencer would like to see a faculty
tenure committee established, composed of full tenured
professors who would play an important role in the

process.

Although professors cannot and should not have the
final say in tenure determinations, their grounds for
complaint are greatly weakened by refusing to take a
more forceful, active role, especially those Withes fil!

tenure.

_ These and other factors must be resovived. However, a
process that shapes the whole character and worth of
Davidson’s future must of necessity be a slow and careful

one. Unlike this editorial, it cannot be done overnight. ©

old system was ‘‘anti-consum-
er’’ because it required action
by those not wishing‘ to partici-
pate.

Dean of Students Will Terry
pointed out that Davidson was
collecting money for a private
agency, since the funds were
sent to state headquarters of
PIRG in Durham. Spencer said
he had received complaints
about the funding procedure
from both parents and stu-
dents.

“There was an undercurrent
of dissatisfaction last year with
the way PIRG was being fund-
ed,”’ said SGA President John
Jackson. :

Spencer emphasized that the
future of PIRG funding is up to
the students themselves. The
deciding factor will be the
referendum regarding PIRG
this fall.‘‘If the student body
wants (the old funding system),
it will be reinstated,’’ said
Spencer. ‘‘It is their choice.”’

Davidson PIRG chairman
Susan Marynowski said she was
upset both by the action itself
and the way it was carried out.
‘The first time I found out
about the change was when I
opened my bill,’’ she said.
‘‘They have never sent any
notification to me or our staff
members.

Comptroller Robert David-
son said the local chapter of
PIRG had been informed last
spring that there might be a
change in the billing procedure.
“I told them that this is all up
in the air and (the fee) may not
be on the bill,” he said, adding,
“We will continue’ to include

PIRG literature in tne mang >

to students which contains the
bill for the year, and we'll give

any money received to David-
son PIRG. But we feel we have
no obligation to the state organ-
ization.”

The financing system was
*‘never intended to be a forever
thing,'’ said Spencer. However,
he did voice his support for the
goals of the organization, which
was established in 1972 to
promote justice social equality,
and the wise use of natural
resources. ‘“‘PIRG came out of
an era of activism and constitu-
ted an effort to work within the
democratic process to bring
about change in an ordered
way,” he said.

Marynowski noted that last
spring, both the Student Senate
and the Council on Campus and
Religious Life recommended to
Spencer that the PIRG fee be
retained on the bill, at least
until another campus-wide re-
ferdum later this fall. The stead-
y income provided by the old
financing system-about 80 per-
cent of Davidson students paid
the fee last year- is necessary to
maintain the professional staff
which coordiantes PIRG’s ma-
jor activities of research, lobby-
ing, litigation, and public a-
wareness campaigns. ;

Marynowski fears that with-
out the old financing system,
Davidson PIRG will likely lose
the the services of this profes-
sional staff.

Despite the drastic cut in
finances, Davidson PIRG con-
tinues to plan for the coming

_ to examine students’ leadership
potential, to provide experience
in volunteerism, and to relate
careers to the ideas of motiva-
tion and service.

According to Spencer, the

applying’ for funding for the
program. He added that ap-
proval of the application is very
uncertain.

Retzer asserted that when he
arrived at Davidson in 1973 the
primary requirements for tenure

were the completion of the’

candidate’s doctorate and the
support of the candidate by his
‘department. Only in excep-
tional circumstances was tenure
not granted, he said.

The new code outlines three

basic criteria for evaluating
professors:
(1) Excellence in teaching, (2)
professional attainments, and
(3) intellectual and moral
values. Furthermore, in the fall
of 1977 Spencer warned the
faculty that at Davidson, as
elsewhere, tenure decisions
would be more carefully consid-
ered.

According to Retzer, the last
time an eligible professor was
denied tenure was in 1973.
However, Spencer explained
many professors have been
refused contract renewals in
recent years, thereby elimina-
ting them as candidates for
tenure. Thus, according to
Spencer, contract termination
can be equated with denial of
tenure as ‘‘the same thing at an
earlier point.”

Both Koller and Retzer pro-
tested that the Administration
neither evaluated their perfor-
mances as junior professors nor
explained their standing as
tenure candidates until the final
decisions were made. Regarding
his profgssional . performance,
Koller stated that in six years,
“No one asked me anything.”

According to Koller, Vice
President for Academic Affairs
Price Zimmermann has begun a
system of periodic evaluations
of nontenured faculty since
coming to Davidson in 1977.
However, since Koller and Ret-
zer had taught at Dayidson for
several years before Zimmer-
mann's arrival,. they were not
included in any evaluation
before they were considered for
tenure.

Retzer complained; ‘‘Now
they review people...when their
contracts come up (for renewal).
They didn’t do that for us.”
Because they received no criti-
cal feedback from the Admini-
stration, both Koller.and Retzer

a three-year, $60,000 grant
tion, according to: Terry. Mr.
Richardson, founder of the Vi-
cho Chemical Company; divised
the program in reaction to the
alarming number of college
leaders dropping out of scho

years. The program offered an

opportunity to redirect this

nd ‘community and to develop this

leadership potential: Similar
programs exist at N.C. State.
University, the University of
N.C, at Chapel Hill, and N.C.
A&T, and were once a part of
Guilford and East Carolina
University.

‘Koller

said they fully expected to
receive tenure. ; :

In a letter to Spencer, Koller
quoted an American’ Associa-
tion of University Professors
(AAUP) recommendation that
the decision to award tenure
““...must come after a continu-
ous evaluation process, during

- which the probationary candi-

date is regularly informed and
counseled about his perfor-
mance and his prospects.”’

Spencer acknowledge that,
“We have had no system of
periodic evaluations’’ for the
group considered for tenure in
1979. He explained that though
periodic evaluations are ‘‘desi-
rable” in examining untenured
professors, they ‘‘have not been
considered essential.’’ How-
ever, Spencer pointed out that
in one sense untenured profes-
sors were certainly evaluated
since they were carefully con-
sidered at times of contract
renewals.

Koller and Retzer maintained
that such contract renewals
were evidence that they would
receive tenure. Spencer,
though, emphasized, ‘‘A con-
tract renewal is not a tenure
decision.’ -Zimmermann poin-
ted out that an assistant profes-
sor who consistently progresses
might still fail to receive tenure
after his sixth year at David-
son. an
Zimmermann explained that
to remain on the faculty long
enough to be considered for
tenure, a professor must be very
competent. However, Zimmer-

mann added, since the College

is building the best faculty
possible—not merely a goad
faculty —a candidate for tenure
might often be ‘‘good but not
good enough.”

mann emphasized that there are
usually no particular negative
reasons why a professor is

refused tenure. Instead, as Zim-

mermann wrote in a open letter,
“A positive tenure decision...
must be based on a pattern of
overall strength in each of the
three general areas designated
by the criteria for evaluation
and on the conviction that the
candidate is the best person to
fill, the position which the

college could hope to find,”

“Attempting to prove such

“overall strength,” Koller wrote
a long letter to Spencer in
August. In it hé detailed his
successes and activities at Dav-
idson and requested a recon-
sideration of the tenure deci-
sion. Spencer declined to
change his decision.
Zimmermann has written all
three professors and offered
them a chance to discuss their
performances at Davidson.
Zimmermann states specifically
that: “‘These conferences will
not be discussions of or justifi-
cations of the tenure decision
itself, but rather personal, in-
formal conferences between the
two of us, intended, in accord-
ance with the spirit of the Code
(of Faculty Evaluation Proce-
dures), to assist you in apprais-
ing your performance here.”
' Koller said that he was
confused by Zimmermann’s
note, for “It is unclear what the
purpose of such a conference
might be if they. are not related
to the tenure decisions.’’ He
stated that such conferences
might have been ‘‘essential’’ .
before the tenure decision.
However, Koller added, ‘‘At
this point it seems to serve little
purpose except to further revive
the hurt associated with the
decision and to further the
mystery of why the decisions
were made.” :

Both Koller and Retzer have
received considerable support
from students and faculty since
the announcement of the tenure
decisions. According to alum- —
nus Michael Kennedy '79, on
May 15, 1979, 483 students
signed a petition co
the decision to deny. Koller
tenure. Approximately 300
signed a similar petition in
support of Retzer, according to .
alumnus Thomas Engle '79..

In addition, numerous. stu-
dents have written to the i a
of Trustees, Spencer, and Zim-
faction with the tenure deci-_
sions. According to Koller and

Retzer, many faculty }
