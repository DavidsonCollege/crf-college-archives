“This program should be ex-
tremely educational and bene-
ficial for all students,” declar-
ed Bill Denham, who along with
Tom Ross is responsible for the
YMCA’s securing Lewis. Den-
ham then added, “Mr. Lewis is a
real sharp guy.”

Although it is not yet certain
whether it will be a debate or a
discussion, the Patterson-Lewis
program will be held Thursdey
Night et 8:30 in Chambers audi-
torium. Earlier that morning
during chapel Lewis will speak
on a subject of his own choos-
ing.

“There is also the possibility
of a coffee hour after chapel
and a talk at one of the frater-
nity houses that afternoon,”
Denham stated and then went
on to say that the YMCA was
open for an invitation from any
fraternity which wanted Lewis
as a guest for lunch.

The Patterson-Lewis program
will be both a follow-up to last
year's showing of the film
“Operation Abolition” by the
ROTC department and the first
of a series of YMCA programs
this year on Communism.

Lewis was technical director
of “Operation Abolition” and
served for 22 years as a re-
search analyst for the HUAC,
during which time he witnessed
the student riots against the
Committee hearings in San
Francisco in May of 1960. “Oper-
ation Abolition” is a documen- |
tary film on these riots.

Holiday Cuts Policy
Remains Unaltered

In action taken last week the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty turned down a request
by a student to put into effect
single cuts during the days pre- |
ceding the Christmas holidays -

Lewis attended the University
of Virginia and then worked for
two years as news director of a
radio station before moving up
to his position with the HUAC
In 1961 he quav that job in order
to speak to colleges on the
HUAC, Communism, and nation-
al security.

He is currently chairman of
the Metropoliten Washington
Council of the Young Americans
for Freedom, which is the larg-
est nation-wide organizetion for
young conservatives.

On Wednesday night, before
coming here for his program

with Patterson, Lewis will be at | °

Body Will Select

building to the campus, placed along side the vtilitarian Chambers

He gave THE DAVIDSONIAN
an official. statement which
read: “The Honor Court would
like to express its disappoint-
ment at the decisinn of the
Student Council in defining the
campus limits of Davidson Col-
lege, particularly since this de-
cision was made without any
effort to consult the opinion of
the court.

“The court had hoped that
this year would be the occasion
of greater co-operation between
the court and the council in
matters of this nature.”

Moore said that the goal has
