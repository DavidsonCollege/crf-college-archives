The Value Of Entertainment

We read the other day that the
Dave Brubeck jazz group has been
banned from appearance on many
Southern colleges and universities by
the Southern Association of Student
Councils. The reason? One member
of the group was colored.

The ban came on the heels of
declarations by directors of public
auditoriums that the mixed group
could not appear in their halls.

The two actions should be ques-
tioned. Both deal with the same im-
plications, and both have the same
effect. We do not mean to dwell on
the moral, intellectual and ethical
facets of the problem. We are sur-
prised. however, that these two
agencies could have such little re-
gard for a demanding (and paying)
public.

The Brubeck group is truly one
of the great jazz ensembles in the na-
tion. It is almost a crime to deny
students the privilege of hearing one

of his concerts. We feel that this is a
question of discrimination, not so
much against Brubeck, who can un-
doubtedly weather the cancellations
in the Southern tour, but against stu-
dents of Southern campuses. If this
sort of thing should become a prece-
dent, what of the entertainment
standards of the South?

The ranks of big bands, jazz
groups, and small combos would be
sadly depleted if mixed groups were
mysteriously to disappear. Carrying it
to the extreme, we would no longer
hear or watch such groups.as Duke
Ellington, Count Basie, Mahalia Jack-
son, or Louis Armstrong. Gone would
be Don Shirley, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah
Vaughn, Dakota Staton, and Cab Cal-
laway. ‘

Let’s face it. No one is being hurt
but the South herself. For the sake
of entertainment standards of the
South, we hope that this action is not
repeated.

And The Rains Came......?

As we looked out of the window
Wednesday night while putting the
DAVIDSONIAN to press, we noticed
that the skies were shedding more
than their usual amount of water on
the Davidson campus. The explana-
tion for this increased precipitation
was readily apparent to those of us
who are seniors.

It was the Wednesday before Mid-
winters and of course. it always rains
hardest during this time of the school
year.

There was one exception to this
statement, however. Two years. ago
there was some sort of a cosmic foul
up and instead of the usual rain, there
fell six inches of snow.

But this year for Midwinters it
appears that the normal will occur
and the rains will come.

Despite the fact that the students
realize that the campus is doomed to
be somewhat submerged during this
week, the administration, even though
they have been here much longer
than the students, seem oblivious to
this fact. We suppose this is the rea-

“WE DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE...”

Hocsaks, Freedom Fighters, Leave Davidson Today

“We do not want to leave,
really. We leave in body—we
leave physically—but we are al-
ways here in spirit.”

Amid the goodbyes of a few
student friends, with belong-
ings piled high on a borrowed
truck, Ivstan Hocsak and his
family moved away today. They
were headed for a new home in
Chariotte—a larger house, clos-
er to his work.

Two nights ago, we visited
them.

DAVIDSON LIFE

“We make many friends,”
Hocsak said of his life in David-
son. “I go to the Union and
talk with the boys and they
are interested. I meet so many,
but I really get to know only
a few. Now many who were
here when we came are gradu-
ated ... But we like here; we
will miss the college, the intel-
lectual level, the people here.”

COMMUNISM

We asked the Hocsaks about
life in Hungary under Commun-
ism.

“You cannot

imagine,” .he

said. “I did not know the free-
dom here until I learned Eng-
lish to read the newspapers.
CRITICIZE

“You can call the President
dumb, yes? In Hungary if you
criticize, if you don't like a
candidate, if you hate Commun-
ism, you are asking to be kick-
ed out of the university. You
get kicked out. You may not be
killed, but you get your reward.

“It was so terrible,” Rosa
said. “We know a Hungarian
boy in Charlotte—he is one of
our friends—who was in prison
nine years awaiting trial. He
was accused of killing Jews; it
was not true. When he was
tried just before the Revolu-
tion, they could find no evi-
dence. They said, ‘We are sor-
ry,’ and let him go. After nine
years, he was so bitter. He miss-
ed his education. Now he is
almost thirty.”

NEW CITIZENS

But in a year and ten months
they will be American citizens
—Steve. Rosa, Mrs. Hocsak, and
five-year old Chippie.

“Then we will be no longer

the tourists,” Steve said. “I can
be licensed as a professional en-
gineer.” Steve. looks forward to
this. An electrical designer for
the J. N. Pease Company in
Charlotte, be has advanced
from a position as junior drafts-
man to designer in less than
three years.

We talked for a long time—
almost ‘til midnight—over cof-
fee. Too soon, the time came to
leave.

“Some of the boys are coming
tomorrow night to see us,” he
said. “You will come?”

We promised that we would.
We didn’t know how to say
good-bye.

STEVE'S LETTER
Letter to the Student Body:

Three years ago right after
Christmas when a little Hun-
garian family arrived at David-
son—The Hocsaks—an enthusi-
astie group of the students, the
YMCA organization and the stu-
dent council together with the
faculty, put their hands on our
future and heJped our first
baby steps in this for us un-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

Students Blast Walidity Of Poll,
IMAC Ruling, Expulsion Attitude

Dear Editor: .

The poll taken of the stud2n
body on Tuesday concerning
the issue of integration at Dav-
idson was an example of the
type of poll which could lead to
conclusions that might be not

only misleading and unreliable

but also erroneous. This poll
was conducted under the most
unscientific conditions imagin-
able.

First, the four choices
which were offered by the
poll were not sdequately ex-
plained. Consequently,  stu-
dents were not able to fully
comprehend the meaning of
the various choices for which
they might cast their ballot.

Secondly, there were no pre-
cautions taken to insure that
each student voted once and
only once. This in itself would
cast doubt on the validity of
any scientifically conducted
poll, no matter the outcome.

I question in the third place
that those present and voting
(legitimately) would be ao fair
representation of the total opin-
ion of the students because
there was no guarantee of a
random sampling of the popu-
lation.

Further, es everyone is
weit aware chapel is not the
most conducive place for the
expression of e true opinion.
The student body take this
time to manifest their chitd-
ish instincts in a beautiful
display of temporary regres-
sion.

In addition there was no ade-
quate control of the influence
of other students on the voter
at the time of voting. This is
always done in a_ scientific
study of public opinion.

In light of the unscientific
mature of the poll, t hope
thet the poll will be rerun
under valid conditions.

The outcome of such a poll
would be valid tepresentation
of the students opinion to pre

gent to the Board of Trustees
as this can never be regardlcss
of the outcome.

Dear Editor:

In the past few weeks a mat:
ter having no precedent in the
history of Davidson College has
arisen. A group of fraternity
men decided to de-brother their
fraternities, It is my under-
standing that for the most part
their motives were to protest
against the fraternity system.

One of thele main goals
was to give the independents
some strength and = spirit,
which would create a chal-
lenge to the fraternity system
and improve not only the in-
dependent group, but necessi-
tate improvement of fratern-
ity standards. A large amount
of this support would be di-
rected to the independent
athletic teams.

Seeing that this would pro-
vide a strong challenge to their
fraternities and wishing to keep
the independents as weak as
possible, several fraternity
members protested this action
in the Intramural Athletic Coun-
cil.

During the ensuing discus-
sion it became apparent that
the protesting ones wished to
take away from the ex-fratern-
ity men all privileges for partic-
ipation in Intramural Athletics.

This was a concerted effort
to chastise the rebellious ele-
ment in the fraternity system.

wings without punishment.
Their main arguing point was

a technicality in the national

rules of the respective fratern-

ities, stipulating that once a

man becomes a brother his
name will always remain on the
books, unless he is expelled.

Having passed the bill to pro-
hibit the participation of this
ex-fraternity group, the Council
made a pesudo-concession —
these men may go back and
play for their respective fra-
ternities.

What sort of concession is
this?

First, the fraternity is not
apt to ask these men to play,
because they have turned their
backs on the group.

Second, this defeats the pur-
pose of these men and causes
them to bow down to the fra-
ternity will if they try to play,
which they don‘t want to do.

Look at the implications of
this Constitutional amend-
ment. Not only does it take
away the eligibility privileges
of the present group, but it
ties the hands of any future
students who find it incon-
venient to remain with their
fraternities.

Is this fair?

Dear Editor:

I was pleased to hear in cha-
pel last Friday morning of the
present deliberations by the
Student Council and Honor
Court. As I understand their
statement, they are in favor .of

The time passed by fast since
then! We became acquainted
with this mysterious language;
we became accustomed to this
special form of life..

FRIENDSHIPS

After 3 years looking back,
my memory recalls the friend-
ships of many students with
whom I was acquainted. Many
students already left the Alma
Mater since and new students
came year by year into the col-
lege.

“Of course I couldn't hold the
acquaintance with the same in-
tensity as in the first year, but
to my pleasant surprise I al-
ways had a “Hey, Steve, how
are you?” in the campus some-
time by students unknown to
me.

LEAVING

I wrote this Jetter because
I'm leaving Davidson and mov-
ing to Charlotte, as my work
ties to the city. In a few words
I'd like to tell all of you what
I got from the college.

First of all, I got new hope
for the future, seeing the love
and the understanding toward

us, who lost everything; home
friends, country, language, and
optimistic look at the life.

I had many other things
which made the life more en.
joyable and let us forget our
hard memories.

HARD MEMORIES

I got financial help from the
college until I find work and 1
could manage our life myself,

Now I've taken successfully
the first examination of pro.
fessional engineering and I'm
taking the final exam in May. 1
have my own car, I bought a
house, I'm teaching mechanics
and mathematics in English as
a tutor.

“HAPPY, CONTENT”

I am a happy, content man,
optimistic for the future. . . I'd
like to direct my life to contri-
bute to the enriching of this
great country through my mod-
est ability.

Thank you professors, stu-
dents for the help which meant
so much to me and for you was
only a wonderful Christmas
thought.

Davidson's ‘Herd’:
An Examination

By PETER STERLING

die a bal

One of the greatest tragedies of contemporary so-
ciety is that loneliness is equated with being alone. It
seems that as soon as one is left to his own resources
he is incapable of genuine enjoyment unless there is
TV, a car, movies or the herd. If a liberal-arts education
teaches anything, it should help develop the individual
so that he can be alone and contented.

At all levels of activity groups play a dominant role
in American life; textbooks are written by study groups,

‘research is cohducted by teams, business is operated by

management teams, politics is dominated by pressure
groups, and religion is equated with church affiliation.

Men have always been “joiners” to a certain de-_
gree. Groups, as Hobbes and Hegel indicated, are
necessary for social progress. .

Perhaps, as Rousseau and Locke would agree, the
general will is the greatest contribution to man’s well-
being. It is only through groups acting conjunctively
that man can make orderly progress.

The greatest problem is not the existence of groups
per se because they are indispensible. The problem lies
with man’s indiscriminate choice of groups.

For either social or psychological reasons, the indi-
vidual feels that he must belong to many varied groups,
whether they be “The Book of The Month Club” or the
Democratic Party. Groups are categorized and classified.
For example, ADA is liberai; DAR is reactionary; the
Communist Party is subversive. Often one belongs to
one or more groups which are diametrically opposed to
one another, causing internal conflict.

Yet, the greatest indictment against the herd
instinct is its leveling effects. individual spontaneity,
creativity and abstract contemplation often have suc-
cumbed to, and been supplanted by, regimented plan-
ned ideals.

Individual goals become those of the state, the or-
ganization, and the group, and the word “education”
often has been prostituted to mean “indoctrination.”
Loyalty and devotion to the organization have become
more vital than individual aims and aspirations.

Democracy, the synthesis of group decisions, can
only survive through individual liberty of thought and
action. In the final analysis, the nation’s degree of edu-
cation, not the number of thermo-nuclear bombs and
missiles, is the United States’ greatest resource.

Davidson College is doing great disservice to it-
self, and to society in general, by the degree of con-
formity that it demands. It is in the formative years of
a man’s life that he should build individual goals and
personal convictions.

As long as the man who thinks differently or acts
independently is condemned as “odd”, one cannot say
that Davidson men are receiving a liberal education.
The students themselves desire, yea demand, group
affiliation. This may stem from the fact that freshmen
are never given a real alternative to group membership.

The classification and compartmentalization of the
student body at Davidson is one of the major reasons
for the lack of communication of ideas and concepts.
It may be contended that most Davidson men are afraid
to be alone; however, more pathetic, they are afraid to
stand up to be counted for something they believe is
right for fear of group ostracism.

honor offense to be readmitted
to Davidson after his expulsion.
The suggested period of puri-
fication is two years.

t was not pleased, however,
by the comment of one of the
deliberators who said in es-
sence: We mado it two years
so they wouldn't come back.

This period of time is not
the basic problem, but the atti-
tude shown here is important.
There seem to be two more
basic problems, and I shall
leave the comment of the de
liberator open to speculation.

The first problem deals with
expulsion itself. Does anyone

Mother Fraternity wasn‘t -go- liberalizing the heretofore “‘un- have the right to expel anyone
ing to let any part of her written rule” which does not else because of dishonesty? An
brood leave the shelter of her allow a person guilty of an honor code which is obeyed

1 CAN Ste THE

-_>

with the awareness that expul-
sion is the penalty for disobed-
ience is nothing but a pruden-
tial course of conduct.

An honor code must be
obeyed because the student
wants to be honest with him-
self and does not want to teke
unfair advantage of his class-
mates and his college. The
code is, or should be, enough.
Expulsion is another arm of
multi - limbed, paternalistic,
Davidson.

The second problem concerns
the Christian college which
would forgive an erring student
but would not forgive an appli-
cant to the college because of
his birth. We need liberaliza-
tion in other areas in addition
to readmission.

Dan Clemmer.
