PSYCHOLOGICAL SWIMMING
Sandy May captains the latest addition to IMAC competition.

Coeds Field Swim
Favored In IMAC

Following the lead of the Stu-
dent Senate, the IMAC has an-
nounced that teams from Grey
House will be allowed to com-
pete in all beginning
with the intramural swim meet.

sports,

According to the girls’ team
captain Sandy May, several ol
the coeds have swimming ex-
perience. Marie Ferrara, Bobby
Blackwood and Cathy Cross
swam competitively in YMCA
leagues, and promise to make
quite a splash in the competi-
tion.

In a phone conversation last
night, May. commented: “We
are going out to win, I fulls
expect that we'll be in the
thick of the fight.”

The girls plan to wear bikinis,
as “psychological warfare,’ ac-
cording to May.

The man to watch in the
swim meet is freshman Randy

Roberts, of Van Nuys, Calif.
Roberts was a_ standout per-
former in high school, setung

age-group records in the in-
dividual medley, 100-yard_ but-
terfly and 200-yard backstroke
events. He'll be swimming for
Sentelle |, and makes them a
favorite.

Asked why he turned down
twenty-five colege scholarship
offers and why he chose not to
swim for the varsity here, Rob
erts said, “I just got tired of
competitive swimming. You
burn so quickly, and I’m really
sick of practice.”

IMAC basketball begins in
January, and what appears to
be a corker of a season is shap
ing up.

A host of changes have been
made in the format. There art
thirty-six teams, and there will
be six divisions. The winner ol
each division, plus the two best
second-place teams will go into
a double-elimination tournament
to decide the IMAC champion.

Other changes include the ad
dition of a faculty team. This
should be one of the top teams
in the league, featuring Terry

Holland, Jim = Larranaga, Dun-
can Postma, and Bo Brickels.

Saints To Come To Davidson;
Contract Ends Subsidy Woes

Davidson’s problems with sub-
sidized football may be over.

According to Tom Scott, di-
rector of athletics at Davidson,
the athletic department has
signed a contract with the New
Orleans Saints that should cover
the costs of scholarships.

The Saints will use Davidson’s
facilities for off-season practice
in the spring and summer
months.

In return for the use of these
facilities, the Saints have agreed
to pay the college $150,000.

This money is to be earmark
ed for footbal scholarships.

This figure meets the pro-
posed need of the football team
for scholarship money, and will
cover all scholarships needed
by the team.

The Wildcat Club will con-
tinue in operation to supple
ment this figure, in hopes that
the team may be able to offer
bigger and better scholarships

in years to come

“We are exceptionally pleas-
ed,” Scott commented, ‘‘and
the money will help fill any
holes we have in our present
program.”

The Saints were also pleased
with the arrangement.

In a release from their front
office, they said ‘‘We are very
pleased about being able to
come to Davidson. We have
known about the Wildcats for
a long time and have a deep
appreciation for their program
and facilities.

“We hope we can build a
good relationship with the Dav-
idson program and the North
and South Carolina area in gen-
eral.

“Davidson as a team plays
our kind of football—aggressive
and exciting, and we hope that
there can be a mutual learning
relationship between our coach-
ing staffs.”

Head Coach Dave Fagg said
that he was excited by the pro-
posal.

“This gives us a decided in

with a fine pro team,” he said,
“and we hope that we can ben-
efit from the experience. Hope-
fully, the proximity of the two
teams will offer us a chance to
learn a lot. Also, this situation
should help us to offer a chance
for our players to break into
pro football.”

The Saints stated that they
were very interested in football
in the Charlotte area.

“We have heard a lot of good
things about that area,” a
spokesman said, “and we are
hopeful. After all, if the Fal-
cons got a Willie Belton out of
Greenville, think of what we
could get from Charlotte.”

The Saints will begin their
spring practice sometime in
April, utilizing the gym and
practice fields. Students may be
somewhat limited in their use
of the gym during that period.

‘We are very sorry for the
inconvenience that this may
cause the students,” Scott said,
“but we know they will be hap-
py to make any sacrifice for
the football team.”
