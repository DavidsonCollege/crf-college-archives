... Constitution

(Continued From Page One)
Bates listed the most sig-
nificant provisions, begin-
ning with the statement of
student rights in Article IV.
A second feature was a
wider base of representation
from the student body in the
proposed Senate than in the
present Student Council.

Members of the Senate
would represent separate
dormitories as well as sep-
arate classes,

Also of importance will be
the SEC. This body will pro-
vide a second opportunity for
vigorous student government
if the president does not
choose to exercise an active

role.
The final three features
which Bates emphasized

were possible checks upon
the broad legislative power

of the Senate. The first—the
referendum of Article V—
would allow the SGA to nulli-
fy any act of the Senate by a
two-thirds majority.

Having two elections a year
to fill the Senate positions
could also make the Senate
more responsive to student
opinion.

The Union has scheduled a

Floyd’s performance is slated

The Union has also plan.
ned surprise midnight con-
certs for both Friday and
Saturday nights.

It's rare that a Davidson
student will get up at 7 every
Sunday morning, and even
rarer that one will volunteer
to write the equivalent of a
term paper every Saturday
night.

But three Davidson sopho-
mores are doing this in order
to be student pastors at
churches in Concord Presby-
tery.

The Presbyterian Church .
of Wilkesboro asked Chaplain
Scott Woodmansee to find ap-
plicants for a student pastor
who would help them until a
permanent pastor could be
found. Woodmansee notified
pre.ministerial students and
members of the YMCA cab-
inet of the opening. Sopho-
more Ken Crews volunteered
for the position and was ac-
cepted.

Two other sophomores.
Franklin Anderson and Bob
Dunham, were interested in
getting similiar posts: once
Crews received the student
pastorate at Wilkesboro, An-
derson and Dunham question-
ed Woodmansee about find.
ing another opening.

Woodmansee found two
churches willing to hire the
students to fill their pulpits,
the Tabor and Harmony
Presbyterian Churches, near
Statesville. Crews started
serving the Wilkesboro con-
gtegation before Christmas.
while Anderson and Dunham
have been serving the two
churches since the end of the
Christmas vacation.

The three students cited
various reasons they should
desire to commit themselves
to preaching every Sunday
morning. Crews. describing

Because of the pressure
for not letting fund-raising

tical requirement that a
president should .be chosen
before a new director of de-

members have said that the
trustees will be quite likely

himself as ‘‘not definitely

wanted to take a look at a
church, at the problems of
sermon preparation, and at
a different element of society.

“I. am presently leaning
toward seminary,”” Dunham
said, ‘I want to make sure
that this is what I want."

The students felt that the
preparation of sermons was
both the hardest and the most
beneficial task. Crews said.
“It cuts down on my Satur-
day night dating.’’ unless he,
“sets aside one night a
week," for sermon writing.

Dunham and Anderson are
alternating Sundays. thus
one week Anderson has the
sermon and Dunham has the
remainder of the service with

all three students prepare a
written text of their sermons.
Anderson said he found him-

scribes his delivery as more
of “a conversation with the

Asked if they had made any
errors they would care to ad-

Fire Chief George S. Hamp-

with fire extinguishers but
couldn't, so we had to use
about 25 gallons of water.”

“I expected to find water

fire department came," said
McKellar, “but they put it

“Sunday night a cop walk-

only barely stumbled on
Wagner, and with the addi-

The symphony, under the
direction of Jacques Brour-

The string and wind ensem-

only by ‘‘crowd noise’ and

The second number con

The orchestra was not as
impressive as earlier when
faced with the vastness of
the Wagner score, but by the
conclusion, it had found its
footing for a good finale.

The final number was the
highpoint of the evening, the

Social Changes Cause
Guilt, Glasse Believes

America is a nation of
displaced persons guilty about
new freedoms, Dr. James D.
Glasse told the student body
in chapel Thursday.

Glasse, associate dean and
professor of theology at Van-
derbilt University Divinity
School, spoke on the topic
“Social Change: Where Are
We Going?"

He ascribed displacement
and disorientation in Ameri-
can society to two factors.
the increased mobility which
persons have in society and
the tremendous prosperity
which Americans enjoy.

“You have a whole new

ciety is now built for playing
as well as working. The older
generation feels guilty about
playing,”

Entertaining his audience
with frequent impersonations
of the ‘standard white pro-

generation, he satirized the
attitude of those opposed to
change as being, “We'll put
