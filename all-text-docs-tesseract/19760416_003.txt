St. Anne revamp causes

By MEG CAMPBELL

The summer program at St.
Anne’s College in Oxford,
England underwent restruct-
uring recently with the drop-
ping of the Exeter Lecture
Series against the recom-
mendations of students who:
have participated in the prog-:
gram. The Exeter series, part
of the Oxford International
Summer school, provided stu-
dents with speakers such as
economists, atomic scientists,
and playwrights. In addition
to attending these lectures,
Davidson students partici-
pated in Davidson-sponsored
tutorials in English literature

and history.

According to College Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencer, Jr.,
the college has set up its own
lecture series in place of the
Exeter Series.

In addition to the dropping
of the Exeter series, the
program has *-2n revamped
by changing we historical
period to be studied. Instead
of concentrating on England
from 1970 to the present,
participants will study the
Tudor-Stuart period.

Frank Southerton of Mary
Baldwin College, who will
direct the St. Anne’s program
this summer, initiated the
changes in the program.
Spencer said that Southerton

“apparently thought that the
Exeter lectures were not ter-
ribly good. He also apparently
thought this was agreed upon
by students.”

Spencer added that al-
though Southerton proposed
the change in the period
studied, that ‘‘when the pro-
gram was set up it was
assumed that the period would
change from time to time.”

In an evaluation, Davidson
students who had participated
in the program were unani-
mous in their opposition to a
withdrawal from the Exeter
series and to the study of an
earlier period.

Robert W. Husbands, a
Davidson student who has
participated in the program,
expressed fears that the
changes will have detrimental
effects on the program.

Husbands said that having
their own lecture series, stu-
dents may tend to restrict
themselves to the St. Anne’s
confines. ‘‘If this happens, it

will be like another Davidson ~

college in England,’’ said Hus-
bands.

Husbands added that the
Tudor-Stuart period can be
studied just as well in David-

son as in England. He said

_.WDAV plans new
# stereo broadcast

. WDAV will go stereo, be-
ginning in the Fall of this year
barring unforeseen circum-
stances. Station manager Jack
Golden reports that the stereo
-control board has been bought
and that the remainder of the
equipment will be forth
coming soon.

”T was just looking through
an advertizing bulletin from
Allied Broadcast Equipment
and ran across an ad for a
control board for a very low
price. After talking to an
expert who said it was a good
buy, we just ponents it,’

concern

that there were advantages to
studying the period 1970 to
the present while living in
England.

“‘What’s happened in Eng-
land since World War II is
very interesting. There has
been a change of attitudes--the
rise of the social state. You
can talk to the professors and
listen to their opinions,’’ he
said.

Spencer said that either
period would be a good periood
to study.

Spencer said that he was
unaware that the program was
to be altered. He said that he
thought the possibility of
change was being considered.
When he learned that almost
all of the Davidson students
who participated in the pro-
gram were against the
changes, Spencer wired Dr.
Marjorie” Reeves, who heads
the lecturerships in St. Anne’s
for the two colleges.

Reeves wired back that it
was too late to reverse the
changes. ‘‘It would be embar-
rassing to me to change now,”’
said Reeve’s reply wire.

Spencer added that this
year’s program would be eva-
luated next year by this
s.unmer’s participants.

Senate to survey students

The SGA Senate’s Commit-
tee on Admissions recently
began a study of the diversity
of the student body at David-
son.

Next week, a questionnaire
formulated by the committee,
the Dean.of Student’s Office,
and the Communications Of-
fice will be distributed among
Davidson students.

The survey will deal with
such factors as socio-economic
status, religion, political ori-
entation, life-goals, life-style,
and geographic distribution.

The results of such quanti-
tative studies are valid only if
a large percent of responses
are received. Student coopera-
tion is necessary for a satis-

factory return-percentage.

process senior’s grades.

The Faculty Executive Committee has changed the
previously announced exam schedule for this Spring.
Exams will now begin on Saturday, May 15 and run
through Wednesday, May 19. The reason for the change,
said the Committee, is to allow the Registrar more time to

Golden explained.

"We're also going to need
some other equipment...the
total should come to about
$3500. The main problem will
be to find the money. There’s
still a chance that the money
will be donated. We're waiting
to see how much we'll get out
of the campus tax,” he added.

Along with the switch to
stereo, Golden anticipates
some programming changes:
’’the number of disc jockeys
will be cut and the shows will
be lengthened from the pre-
sent two hour format to three
or four hour shows. Things are
going to have to be tightened
up.”

Album thefts continue to
plague WDAV. New albums
are being stolen almost im-
mediately. ’’I am so disgusted
with the whole thing that if I
catch someone, I’ll take him to
the honor court,’’ vowed Gol-
den: “‘If someone wants to
ruin his career for one record
album, I’ll be glad to oblige
him,” he concluded.

A quorum-less Senate con-
vened Tuesday night, with
votes having to be postponed
on the proposed Union By-
laws, Election «Reform
Amendments, and some new
Traffic Regulations.

Thus crippled, the Senate
heard a report from Mark
Armstrong, who charged the
Athletics Department with
failing to fulfill its commit-
tment to the Club Sports
program.

Citing budgeting foul-ups,
lack of insurance coverage for
players of Club Sports, in-
adequate facilities and the
refusal of the Athletics De-
partment to allow players of,
Club Sports to use the training
room, Armstrong blamed:
Armstrong blamed Athletic
Director Thomas A. Cartmill
for the state of club sports.

He called for Senate action
on the matter, and the Senate
promptly appointed a commit-
tee to delve into the issues
involved.

In other non-action, the
Course Evaluation Forms for
Winter Term were distributed.

SGA President Bo Baskin
stressed the need for the forms
to be completed and returned
no later than the 27th of April.

The Senate also heard Pro-
fessor of Economics Robert
Avinger outlined the coming
year’s programs for the Ho-
nors Center. Avinger was
recently named Dean of the
Center. |

Filling the vacancy created
by the resignation of Warren
Soule, Ed Rees was confirmed
as Chancellor for the Senate.
