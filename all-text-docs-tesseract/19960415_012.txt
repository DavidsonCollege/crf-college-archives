Yoga pulls out the kinks

By Nick PAuL
Staff Writer

Last Thursday in the Big
Screen Room, the good people who
have set up South Asian awareness

.week hosted a Yoga workshop. It

was instructed by Dot Kaylor, a
longtime enthusiast and student of
Yoga. . The setting was relaxing
and instuctive; I think that all of us
who attended came away feeling
more at peace with ourselves and
with a more complete understand-
ing of the now popular Indian art.

Kaylor’s technique concen-
trates on unifiying breath and
movement while performing the
ancient movements and stretches.
She told us that all of the stretches
and bends in Yoga are meant to
allow the body to sit perfectly on
the ground. The sitting position
has always been imperative for the
Yoga gurus of India who attempt
to retain the position for days at a

time while reciting Vedic chants

and entering into meditative states.
With this in mind, we began in the
cross legged sitting position fo-
cusing on our breathing cycle. Then
we attempted a few of the stretches.
To say that I am not the most
flexible guy at Davidson would be
somewhat of an understatement.
Fortunately for me, flexibility is
not required to attempt any of the
positions. The mostimportant rule
of Yoga to remember is the two
word guideline, “Steady, com-
fortable.” :

While Yoga is often associ-
ated with the Hindu religion of
India, it is in fact a practice outside
of religious boundaries. Yoga is
meant to remove the “kinks,” as
Kaylorcalled them, fromthe body.
Combined with meditation, it’s
objective is to forge a more perfect
union between the human con-
sciousness and the universe.
Kaylorcommented that, “we don’t
regard the body enough in our
(Christian) religion,” and I agree.
