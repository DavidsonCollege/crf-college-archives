Ars Antiqua lai

ARS ANTIGUA DE PARIS, formed in
1965, will perform Friday as part of the

Artist Series.

By CATHY LANDIS
Features Editor

France comes to Davidson Friday,
March 19. Ars Antigua de Paris
ensemble consists of four instrument-
alists and a counter-tenor. The coun-
ter-tenor comes with special acclaim
being the only one in France.

Ars Antigua de Paris revives the
music of the thirteenth to the seven-
teenth centuries including highlights
from the Troubadour tradition, the

zabethan England.

The Music featured blends anti-
guita with authenticity. Part of the
group’s charm stems from their use of
instruments indicative of the period.

They perform upon the soprano
viole, bass viole, viele, febec, Renais-
sance lute, soprano lute, recorders,
cromornes, musettes, a portative
organ, and percussion instruments.
This unique collection gives the
ensemble their distinctive musical
sound and original flavor.

The ensemble formed in 1965
consists of Joseph Sage, haute-coitre,
Elisabeth Matiffa, dessus de viole,
basse de viole, Michel Sanvoisin,
flutes a bec, cromornes, musettes,
Kleber Bessen, luth et vihuela.

The performers will display some of
the more unusual instruments of the
period in a reception in the Morrison
Room after the concert. Coffee will be
served.

The performance should add var-

yates traditional music

iety and class to the traditionally
routine Davidson Friday night. As
the Washington Star said, ‘‘Cet
ensemble, compose de quatre merveil-
leux instrumentistes et d’une except-
ionelle haute-contre, joua avec une
superbe musicalite durant toute la

soiree.”’

Hot Tuna soawns “Yellow Fever’

By CHUCK KENNON
Managing Editor

Hot Tuna’s latest album (six
months old), ‘Yellow Fever,’ is the
most recent variation on the acid-rock
theme created by the Jefferson
Airplane a decade ago.

Now, as then, any discussion about
either of the present twin incarnations
of that sound, Tuna or Jefferson
Starship, must be laden with superla-
tives. That either group has survived
and evolved this long is a
simultaneous testimony to the viabil-
ity of very heavy metal rock in the
current music wasteland and the good
taste of a few discerning partiers.

Since the breakup of*the Airplane
five years ago the pleasingly abun-
dant supply of albums by both groups
(including various independent
efforts, notably Grace Slick’s
Manhole) has afforded a chance to
observe the divergent paths they have
taken.

Tuna consists of Jorma Kaukonen
on lead guitar, Jack Casady on bass,
and Bob Steeler on percussion. Kauk-
onen and Casady provided the core of
the rhythmic hard core of the Air-
plane’s wall of sound, and this is hap-
pily still their forte.

Starship, with Grace Slick, Paul
Kantner, and now Marty Balin,
provided the intertwining melody and
soaring ideological characterizing the

heydey of the 60’s sounds and theirs ~

is the more marked musical progres-
sion from that era, but the change is
still only a matter of slight degree.
‘Yellow Fever”’ perfectly illustrates
the patternized sound that has
worked well for Kaukonen and
Casady over the years. It works well
because they consistently reach the

high standards they have set for
themselves and that their audience

knows and expects of them. They are
perfectionists, and if all their songs
sound the same it is because they

have sense enough to stick with a
proven product.

Lacking the writing talent of Slick
and Kantner, the emphasis in Tuna is
on instrumental prowess. Kaukonen
has customized killer instinct with the
guitar and Casady’s bass can evoke
wicked pulsing beats or soaring
flights. The drums share the power
that flows through this music, acting
as the backbone of the total inter-
meshing of music. (Really, words fail
me here.)

The album’s lyrics deal with an
interesting topic -- the compromising
of flower-power ethics in this time of
hard core realities. The 70’s area
bummer but the music remains light
and tight, showing that life must be
gotten on with, even if viewed
through a fog.

Side A is started oft by ‘Davy,
What You Want Me to Do?’. This
song typifies the state of Tuna right
now, reflecting a bit of jazzy
influence in Kaukonen’s leads, and a
bluesy edge to his vocals. The guitars
are steady and hard driving, with
Casady breaking from his strong
rhythm position to deliver some fine
riffs. Kaukonen here, as elsewhere,
makes his guitar wail enough to make
up for the lack“of Papa John Creach.
As an opening song it well sits the
mellowed acidic tone of the album,
with musical evolution from the
Airplane days but no real change.

Next is ‘‘Hot Jelly Roll Blues,’’
which features another good lead-in
and compelling double-tracked vocals

kaliedoscope world o1

(as Kaukonen is the main vocalist this
is a favorite Tuna device). The lyrics
are humorous, dealing with some of
the obsessions of our times. The
song’s ending has the tumultuous
finesse the Airplane patented.

“Free Rein’’ follows, and it is the
weakest song on the album. It is
purely a ‘‘pattern’’ song, every note
standardized and with no surprises. It
is eminently forgettable, except that
the lyrics are worth listening to. They
tell of the ending of the spirit of the
Movement and the degeneration
brought about by the present stagna-
tion of ideas.

“Sunrise Danced with the Devil”’ is
the last track. on this side. It opens
with an especially strong bass. It then
swings into a good lilting tune,
suitable for the subject matter of the
Ivrics -- a girl, now lost in the

san ctan
Lui ovup

partying. The ending has particularly
strong acid-rock riffs, a la Airplane,
that. well conjures up the image of a
rudderless, lost cult, partying its life
away.

The second side begins with ‘Song
for the Fire Maiden,’’ a worthy
product of this group’s mold. It is a
good example of the tight sound the
three-man format allows. The lead,
bass, and drums interweave to pro-
vide a delicate yet jarring structure,
one that is obviously perfected and of
itself has little room for growth.

“Bar Room Crystal Ball’’ is the
archtype Tuna track, establishing a
hard but light jazzy-acid sound and

soaring with lyrics that tells tales o1
carrying on in the face of harsh
realities, such as poverty and drugs.
There are few issues left, only the
refuge of the mundane, dominated by
the struggle for the next meal. The
party goes on, and Tuna blares forth
in a style wrought by craftsmen.

“Half/Time Saturation”’ carries on
the hard-driving tempo, charged with
Kaukonen’s double-tracked vocals
and hard-driving Airplanish jags.
Casady’s bass shows much of the
acid-rock twang of yore.

The last song is ‘‘Surphase Ten-
sion,’’ an instrumental and the
delight of the album. It has a
swirling, beautiful lead and a well
balanced drum-bass beat.
Kaukonen’s guitar has a sitarish
quality like the early Airplane days,
but he is more soaring than when he
was surrounded by Kantner and
Slick’s vocals. The music ripples back
and forth between’the speakers,
making devastating use of stereo
separation. The song is a delight for a
well-fed head, highly reminiscent of
the good old days. Here Tuna is
working as a team in the finest San
Francisco spirit, creating an almost
tangible wall of sound. The only
nreblem is that it is too short, only six

Vw owas

minted:

Indeed the Hot Tuna pattern works
well. The heavy-metal sound that was
the core of the Airplane sound is alive
and well. But it is in the position of all
highly perfected commodities. High
standards have been erected and met,
but there is little tolerance of experi-
mentation and so little chance for
growth.

The winners are still being cranked
out, but the inspirational force of the
whimsical Kantner-Slick tricksterism
is missed (and Starship suffers from
the lack of the propellant of Tuna’s
guitars).
