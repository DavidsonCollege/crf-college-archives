While the Davidsoniay has no set policy

Spencer, in chapel recently, in regards to
thelaxity of the Davidson Spirit is heartily
backed by this sheet.

Durind® the past few weeks, especially
since-therPawidsoiteValdcats haye failed to

been decidedly onthe poor side. * Support

Davidson students shouldn’t expect victor-

There’s not fifteen other schools in the coun-
try that would expect the teams represent-
ing their institutions to lick teams like this
and just because eleven hard-fighting Wild-
cats fail to do it is no reason for the entire
student body to go against them.

Davidson’s oldest, and best, tradition is

try as the finest support given to any team
by any college. Are we going to lose this dis-

As was stated by Spencer, instead of ex-
pecting the freshman class to uphold this
tradition, why not expect and make the
whole student body take a hand in it.

It is self-evident to any and all on—the

Davidson campus thit the step taken. by
the faculty in modifying the cut system is
one of signal importance, first of all in
cementing relations between students and
faculty, and secondly, in proving beyond a
shadow of a doubt that intelligent thiftking
and cooperation constitute ‘the enly way in
Which, progress can be made;

Last semester the Student-Faculty Rela-
tions Committee suffered quite a good eal
of abuse and criticism from the student
body on the grounds that it did nothing,
However, as members of the group pointed
out, the very objectors themselves were ty-
ing the hands of the committee by:constant
demonstrations resulting in damage to col-
lege property, ~ Never had the faculty done
anything as a result of force, and each new
outbreak stiffened: determination to do no-
thing so long as the student body resorted
to violent methods, Hence, nothing—abso-

lutely nothing—was accomplished, ,

Matters this semester have been a pleas-
ant contrast. On a whole.the student body
has acted intelligently and sanely; as a
consequence, the faculty has naturally been
willing to deal with the students as mature,
intelligent, thinking persons. Also, affairs
not being at a fever pitch; all concerned have
been able to consider things from a logical,
long-range Viewpoint.

In view of this attitude of cooperation,

It’s something for all of us to remember ;

Football Players Need ‘Success Motive’

Football coaches who like to play the
role of “Gloomy Gus” before every grid-
iron battle are poor psychologists and in-
vite defeat.

That is the opinion of a University of
Minnesota psychologist, Prof, Charles Bird,
and he thinks something ought to be done
about it.

“After all, football players are like the
rest of us,” he says. “We do better when
we get a little praise, or when we can look
ahead to victory.

“Most football players are young and sus-
ceptible—about 19 or 20 years jold on the
average. They feel keenly, “I don’t be-
lieve it does any-good-to-have-a-coach point
to nothing but defeat. Like the rest of us,
they need the ‘success motive’.”
