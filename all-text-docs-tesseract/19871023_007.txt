Sparse crowd welcomes NBA

By HAP BRYANT

As the doors opened on
Wildcat basketball for the 1987-
88 season, so did the portals of the
NBA in Charlotte. Last Friday,
the Adanta Hawks, 1987’s Cen-
tral Division champions, faced the
rejuvenated Indiana Pacers, who
featured NBA rookie of the year
Chuck Person.

As this was the first NBA
game in Charlotte for some time,
it should have exemplified the ris-
ing NBA spirit in Charlotte. I was
interested to see how Charlotte
would accept the NBA and how
the NBA aura would descend
upon the city. Consequently, I ob-
tained a press pass to the game
through the UNCC Sports Infor-
mation Office and set myself on a
course of semi-professional jour-
nalism.

Luckily, I was able to sit on
press row for the first half of the
game. Upon arrival, I observed
the size of the players warming up
on the court. From courtside, one
can really appreciate the colossal
figures of today’s NBA players.

On televison, the viewer does
not realize the height and breadth
of the players, since the only
chance to compare players with a
“normal” person comes when an-
nouncers interview them after a
game. Though most of the players
seemed simply huge, some smal-
ler ones were scampering around
the court, namely Anthony
“Spud” Webb of the Hawks, a

_ former_N.C. State player. whom_.

the crowd soon adopted.
Unfortunately, I did not re-
ceive full NBA indoctrination be-
cause the crowd was somewhat
sparse — only 3,739 people
showed up in the 1 ! ,666-seat Col-
iseum. Consequently, the noise
~ level was much below that of a
regular NBA game, and the fan
appreciation, though present, was
diminished. As the game began, I
sensed a reawakening, even with
the small attendance. Action had

returned after a summer to recup-
erate, and the players, coaches
and fans seemed glad.

As the game progressed, I
noticed quite a bit of contact “in
the paint.” Wide bodies on both
sides struggled for position and
met with force in the process. At
first, the referees seemed to allow
the pushing, shoving and holding.
After a while, however, Jess Ker-
sey began to yell at them: “Stop!”
“Quit holding!” “No more push-
ing in there!” When the players
continued to body each other,
Kersey and his cohort began to
call fouls. In all, the Hawks com-
mitted 36 fouls; the Pacers, 33.
Who says basketball is a non-con-
tact sport? :

In the first quarter, Scott
Skiles came off the Pacer bench to
scattered boos from the crowd.
Skiles’ confrontations with the
law are well-documented. While
at Michigan State, he committed
several offenses, most notably
driving while intoxicated, and
spent time in jail. Last year, he
could not latch on with the Mil-
waukee Bucks, and he was sub-
sequently dealt to the Pacers.

Skiles was as impressive as
anyone on the court during the
first half of play, particularly in
his basketball mindset. He con-
trolled the flow of the game for the
Pacers, directed his teammates,
made great passes and showed his
overall court savvy. He seems
ready to leave his troubles behind

NBA player.

The play of the Hawks’ Dallas
Comegys was also interesting. At
DePaul, Comegys was a dominat-
ing force. He thought he could put
forth the same effort he did in col-
lege and succeed in the NBA.
However, the Pacers rudely awak-
ened him Friday night. They stole
the ball from him when he was not
careful, and they rejected shots
that he easily made in college. Ob-
viously , Comegys will have to get

an NBA mind and a little humility
before he makes an impact with
the Hawks.

In addition to Spud Webb, the
main, attration was the Hawks’

Dominique Wilkins, the “human

highlight reel,” one of the most
electrifying players in the NBA.
The crowd sensed that Wilkins
was ready to soar, which he did on
several occasions early in the
game, but he came up empty.
Soon, however, the crowd got
what it came for. With 1:58 left in
the second quarter, Wilkins per-
formed some aerial wizardry that
awoke the Coliseum. As he led a
Hawk fast break, spectators rose
to their feet. He then glided by a
defender, leaped into the air some
eight feet shy of the basket, and
sailed toward the goal. he held the
ball low at first, then quickly
brought it above his head. Sud-
denly, he performed a forceful
roundhouse dunk, at which the
crowd cheered.

Despite Wilkins’ 30 points,
including several dunks, the
Hawks fell behind midway
through the third quarter. Sloppy
play, indicative of pre-season
‘ball, was the culprit. It was obvi-
ous that the players had been apart
for some time, as connections
were missed, plays jumbled, and
passes misfired. The Pacers
seemed to mitigate their mistakes
by outrebounding the Hawks and
by stellar performances from Per-
son, Wayman Tisdale and Steve
Stipanovich. The Hawks made
several runs, but they could not

The second half did not bring
any relief for the Wildcats.
Lafayette added on to their 21-
point first half tally in the form of
two more touchdowns and a field

run for one score. Struncius con-
nected on his third touchdown
pass of the day to Lechner from 16
yards out for the final Leopard
touchdown. The ’Cats did manage
a nine-play, 42-yard drive in the
third quarter, culminating with
quarterback Peter Hughes keeping
it on a 12-yard run.

The game saw the Leopards
accumulate 455 yards of total of-
fense to Davidson’s 160. Adams
finished the day with 115 yards of
rushing, matching the total for all

finished.the game with 13 of 24
passing for 152 yards. Lafayette
upped its record to 2-1, 4-2, while
Davidson fell to 0-3, 0-7.

The Wildcats again take their
campaign on the road Saturday,
this time to face Wofford in Spar-

tanburg, S.C.

The world (series) turned

upside-down

By ROB GRZESZCZAK

and CARTER GARRET

It’s October once again; the
leaves are turning, the air is crisp,
and in the midst of ahoopla,
baseball’s fall classic is under-
way. Yes, the World Series has
started. But something is differ-
ent — something’s missing.
Alas, as Slap Maxwell aptly put it,
the autumnal air is cut off by the
metrodome, and the smell of the
freshly cut grass has been replaced
by astroturf. There are no more
“terrible towels”, and no more
“waves”. No, this year’s fad is the
“homer-hanky”, thousands of
which are waved exuberantly in
the “homer-dome:” In a cruel
manner, the well-ordered world of
major league baseball has been se-
verely shaken.

For one thing, the Minnesota
Twins are in the Series. The

Missouri provide the perfect foil
for the Twin Minnesota. So it
should be a great series, right?

No, not really. Whatever hap-
pened to the classic contests be-
tween the Dodgers and the Yanks,
or the Reds and the Red Sox?
Well, today’s teams are led by a
different breed of players. No
more Garveys, Jacksons, or
Roses. No more Big Red
Machines, either. Today it’s the
.Laudners, the Penas, and the
Oquendos. You know, the guys
who can hit in the . 150-.210 range
and still get the starting nod.

In the opposing dugout sits
Tony Pena, the St. Louis Cardi-
nals’ catcher. Tony hit for a higher
percentage (.214) than Laudner,
and on top of that drove in one
more run (for a total of 44). In ad-
dition to these scary stats, Pena
swiped an alarming six bases this

here, as the Twinkies had to fight
off the A’s and the Angels, not to
mention perennial contenders
Seattle and Texas. The Twins also
suffer the dread of representing a
whole state instead of a city. But
on the field, Minnesota is noted
for its power, and that’s definitely
their big advantage in the match-
up.

The Cardinals, on the other
hand, don’t have any power. With
Jack Clark out, the Redbirds are

led by such sluggers as Ozzie

win 111-101.

Even though they lost, the
Hawks showed signs of greatness,
of a team ready to climb into the
upper echelon of the NBA.
Likewise, even though attendance
was small, those there lent their
wholehearted support, showing

Smith, Jose Oquendo, and
Tommy Herr, all of whom com-
bined for a hefty total of three
round-trippers this season. But the
Cardinals hit for average, play
good defense, and possess excel-
lent team speed. Some real prob-
lems start to surface when you
consider the state in which the St.
Louis Cardinals play. It’s actually
not Missouri itself, but rather the
nickname. What exactly do you
make of “the show me state?”
Show me what? And why should
we.show Missourians their own
state? But on the baseball dia-
mond, the Cardinals of St. Louis,

Tony truly takes after the fine line
of Cardinal catchers, which in-
cludes such greats as Bob Uecker
and Joe Garagiola. But, at thirty’
years of age, it may only be a mat-
ter of time before Pena is flashing
signals in baseball’s land of the
lost — the Japanese league.

So who is going to win? Well,
that’s not really a fair question, as
the writers of this article have al-
ready watched the Twinkies take
the first two at home. But the Red-
birds aren’t out of it yet. Look for
the Cards to pull a trick or two at
home in Busch stadium.

Many people, however, .
know that the Cardinals are hun-
gry for a victory after letting the
title slip away in °85, so such on-
field capers. might be anticipated
by the Twins. But tricks or no
tricks, we can’t predict the out-
come, and on top of that we cer-
tainly can’t predict too much ex-
citement. In fact, we can only ex-
press our true anguish and regret
from this whole affair — that
being ABC’s decision to go ahead
and replace the highly ‘entertain-
ing show “Dolly” with America’s
favorite pastime. Folks, it’s a
crazy world out there.
