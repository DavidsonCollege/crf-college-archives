The conversion of the Grey
Library into the new Student
Union has been the most time,
money and materials consu-
ming project of the three
involving the Physical Plant
Office.

Meetze also considers it to be
the most rewarding project he
has been involved with in his
tenure at Davidson

HARAIS will lecture next Tuesday and Tuesday

Wednesday [Sept. 23-24] on several prob-
lems of modern man.

Long heads alumni activities

Zachary F.. Long Jr® recently
assumed the post of director of
alumni activities at Davidson
after serving four years in the
capacity of associate director of
alumni relations.

His appointment followed the
resignation of Howard Arbuck-
le, director of alumni relations
and the Annual Fund, who has
joined an insurance firm in
Greensboro.

Arbuckle’s former post has
since been split into two essent-
ially autonomous posts dealing
with alumni relations and the
Annual Fund as separate enti-
ties. Long has filled the former
position and according to Crav-
en Williams, vice president-de-
velopment, a new staff member
is being sought as director of
the Annual Fund.

“Because of the college's
increasing activity in alumni
relations and the Annual Fund,
we believe two director-level
appointments are needed for
those areas”, said Williams.

“Mr. Long will concentrate
on the program aspects of the
alumni association, both on
campus and in areas where we
have active alumni chapters.

He will be responsible for
planning and promoting alumni
reunions, Homecoming, alumni
class activities, and area meet-
ings. He will also be responsible

LONG

for our Parents Council and
Board of Visitors.”

In its attempts to increase its
contact with alumni the college
has also reorganized its 60
alumni chapters. 1974-75 Alum-
ni Association president Blaine
Kelley Jr. has conceived a plan
in which each chapter is to

“Just to be a part of the
planning and execution of this
project has been very reward-
ing,” said Meetze. “The spirit
of the students, administrators
my Physical Plant people, and
others working to get this job
done has been just something
else--great!”

“This summer people worked
together to do whatever was
necessary. Carpenters would
become painters, or electricians
would become plumbers, if that
was what was needed.”

Working within a $440,000
budget, Meetze saw his main
challenge as“to design some-
thing more than just a nice
clean building.”

In order to have more money
to put into new materials,
Meetze reused many fixtures,
furniture, and other materials
from both the Grey Library and
the old Student Union Building.

The latter was torn down in
the summer of 1972 to make
room for the Little Library.

“We saved probably $40,000-
$50,000 by installing heating
fixtures in the new Union that
we saved from the old one when
it was torn down,” Meetze
pointed out.

“The tables in the second

floor conference room of the
Union were ones already in the
Grey Library. We refinished
them for a fraction of the cost to
buy them new.

“The way things are now, we
don’t dare to throw anything
away. A plumbing fixture this
size,” said Meetze as he made a
fist, “can cost a couple of dollars
today. So we salvage whatever
we can from the old to use again
in the new.”

Saving old but still functional
materials has created a new
problem for Meetze. “We need
more warehouse space to store
these materials.” Meetze is
currently working through ad-
ministrative channels to get the
space his office needs.

Two design and engineering
problems faced Meetze in con-
verting the Grey Library into
the Union. First was the
restructuring needed when
hundreds of four-inch square
support columns were removed
from the West Wing of the
building.

“Just to make sure our
calculations were correct, I
carried bags of cement up to
the newly restructured areas
and stacked the bags up to
make sure the areas could take

the weight. There were no
problems,” added Meetze.

The second major design
challenge for Meetze, who has
been both architect and engin-
eer of the Union, was to create
an accoustically sound building.

“There are different accous-
tical demands upon each room
in the building. The Taverne,
for example, needs to be suit-
able for both speeches and
musical ensembles--and these
two categories alone fall at
opposite ends of the accoustical
spectrum.”

Meetze said that he is inter-
ested in reactions from all who
use the Union as to the success
of his accoustic and other func-
tional designs for that building.

The Carnegie Building (the
old, temporary College Union)
is on its way to completion in its
new function as both a student
residence and a i a guest
house.

Five rooms for women stu-
dents occupy the basement of
that building as contractors
work to finish the upper two
stories. No estimates are
currently available as to the
cost of reworking Carnegié or
its date for completion.

Senate approves parking fines

At the SGA Senate meeting
night, Ed
Willingham, chairman of the

eventually have area vice presi-
dents who will concentrate on
admissions, development, ex-
periential learning, and athle-
tics.

Long, who is to have a major
role in coordinating the new
program, said that the program
will “enlarge the college’s con-
tacts with the alumni”. He
noted that the new structure
for the alumni chapters will
provide a more organized
framework from which to reach

out to alumni. The better —

organization will allow the a-
lumni office to “improve what
we've been doing,” said Long.

The chapter vice president in
charge of admissions will at-
tempt to identify outstanding

students in his particular re-.

gion as will the vice president
in charge of athletics identi-
fy high caliber athletes. Vice
presidents in charge of develop-
ment will aid in the fund raising
drives of the college.

Long pointed out, though,
that having a regional chairman
in charge of experiential learn-
ing is an innovation that will
hopefully enhance the contact
between students and alumni.

Parking Committee, received
unanimous Senate support for
the new parking regulations.
Significant among the changes
is the increase of parking fines
from $5 to $10.

Willingham recommended
the increase, not as a means of
raising revenue, but in the
hopes that the number of
parking violations will decline
or not, the $10 fines are here to
stay.

Also at the meeting Tuesday
night--the first meeting of the
year--Roger Brown pointed out
that the 1:00 classes this term
conflict with many of the
upperclassmen’s eating
schedules. This is the first year
in which classes have been held

during the 1:00 hour.

Most of these classes. are
primarily for freshmen, but
Brown reported that he knew
of upperclassmen who had
registered for these classes and
now found themselves with
conflicts on Patterson Court.
For want of hard statistics, or
even specific complaint, no
action was proposed.

John Munce reported on the
continuing effort to install the
new governance system.

Finally, Brad Swalwell
announced his retirement from
the paid position of SGA
Chancellor, imminent with the
winter student body elections.
Volunteers to replace Swalwell
are now being sought.
