possible,

Junior Senator Bill Alex-
ander, who was defeated in
the contested election by
eight votes, said that he was
bringing the matter to the
Senate so that that body
could act as an impartial
judge of the matter.. He
said that the body was em-
powered to act in that the

Elections Board, which is re-'-

sponsible for SGA elections,
is under the supervision of
the Senate.

With regard to the recougit
issue, Coble pointed out that
a. number of elections have
been -held over the past few
years without tthe use of a
sheet for voter's signatures.
He said that because of this
and because there is no
specific election procedure
outlined in the SGA Consti-

Terry. Sees'I ‘Impro vement

In F Seti Assignment

By ALEC HOON
News Editor

“We are trying to make

communications between
freshmen and fraternities as
easy as possible.”
“Thus spoke Dean of Stu-
dents William Terry of his
efforts to make the new so-
cial system a workable en-
tity at Davidson. It is Ter-
ry’s job to juggle all the
variables—the attitudes. of
freshmen, fraternity broth-
ers, the administration, and
the trustees-and create ‘a
situation agreeable to all.

To encourage better parti-
cipation by the freshmen in
the new social system, the
random: assignment has been
altered so that groups of
freshmen from the same hall
can go together to the vari-
ous houses to eat and soci-
alize. zg

In regard to this change,
Terry said, ‘After consult-
ing hall counselors, students,
and “members of the Com-
mittee of eighteen, we
thought that the new pro-
cess was a better way.

‘In the “old assignment,
freshmen were often placed
in houses where they didn’t
even know the other fresh-
men. It was tough enough
for the freshmen to become
acquainted with each other,
much less to be. able to
meet the various fraternity
brothers.

“In. the new assignment,
the freshmen all know each
other, and their hal counse-
lor (the»one responsible for
taking them to their frater-
nity) is whenever’ possible
a brother in the house to
which he is, taking them.”’

Analyzing the possibility
for a compromise between
the fraternity court and the
trustees Terry stated, ‘‘I do

‘not feel that the trustees
will go back on their deci-

sion.’

- However, hie’ final one con-
solation to offer the frater-
nities going off campus. He
said that he did not antici-
pate. the college taking any
legal action to prevent a
fraternity from moving off
campus.

Terry spoke with cautious
optimism touched with a
note of warning about. his
feelings on the possible suc-
cess of ‘self-selection.

“IT have seen, a lot of apat-
hy among freshmen. I think
that this is a result of a
lack “of security and confu-
sion. I believe that this is
a normal response for a
class placed -in this  situa-
tion.

‘While I don't think that
it is going to be easy, I
feel that eventually the new

Coble went on to give
some background informa-
tion on the handling of the
situation as’ of the meeting.
He said that Allen Peter-
son, senior class president
and chairman of the Elec-
tions Board, had contacted
him this week as to the pos-
sibility that voting irregu-
larities had occurred.

Peterson, said Coble, had
told him that the Elections
Board had agreed that three
confessions of voting fraud
would invalidate the  elec-
tion, and that these admis-
sions of guilt would not be
prosecuted.

Coble said that he would

report any violators to the :

Regulations Court for appro-
priate *, action. He _ pointed
out that the SGA Constitu-
ion placed voting fraud un-

‘der the jurisdiction of that

court,

Danny Clodfelter, SGA
president-elect and a mem-
ber of the Elections Board,
added that the Jurisdiction
Committee (composed of the
Dean of Students, Chairman
of the Honor Court and
Chairman of the Regulations
Court) could conceivably
place multiple voting under
the jurisdiction of the Honor
Court.

He went on to point out
that he had been consulted
about neither voting policy
nor the possibility of ir-
regularities, and that, to his
knowledge,’ the ‘Elections
Board had made. no deci-
sion in the matter at hand.

Allen Peterson and Gerry .

Bello,’ the other members of
the Board, were not present
at the meeting to clear up
the question of responsibili-
ty.

Junior Senator Frank

‘dorms and

Dana said that the issue
was not actual voting fraud,
but the standards of irregu-
larity which govern SGA
elections at Davidson. He
maintained that ‘excessive
carelessness’ in the handl-
ing of elections should be
considered -an i ularity.

‘He went on to say that,
Inasmuch as the present sit-
uation could be rectified, the

election should -be ‘held
again.
Freshman Genator Dan

Thorne forwarded a resolu-
tion that the election be re-
held. After discussion, espe-
cially about the nature of
irregularities in voting’ pro-
cedure, the resolution was
passed by a vote of nine to
four. Both Alexander and
Sophomore Class President
Bob. Edmunds, winner of the
contested race, abstained.
Eight senators were absent.

In addition to this new
election, Honor Court elec:
tions for the class of '74 will
be held again also because
of errors made in the actual
marking of the ballots,

In a_ short valedictory,
President Coble said that it

had been a good year, point-

ing to the new social, system,
the increased number of
speakers, self-scheduled ex-:
ams and the course evalua-
tion handbook as examples

. of succeés. He said that the

most significant failures had
been in the areas of open
student repre-
senation on the Admissions
Committee.

He ‘also noted that the real
successes of the Senate had
been in selling the concept of
community and in increas-
ing interest in student gov-
ernment among the student
body. |

Clodfelter Discusses Plans

ED. NOTE: The following
interview with SGA Presi-
dent-elect Danny. Clodfelter
was conducted by Assistant
Managing Editor Robert
Touchton.

What do you consider the
greatest challenge to the
SGA?

To translate the basis of
student influence from ama-
teur lobbying to direct par-
ticipation in decisions _af-
fecting student life, acade-

mic; social; and’ financial:"~

What do you want most to
accomplish during your ad-
ministration?

Not a list of promises, on-
ly a set of ideal goals:
meet the ‘greatest chal-
lenge” (above); get the stu-
dent today through’ the

transition period with the

new social system; and for
the first time, open student
eyes to the importance of

finaneial._policies in guch

matters as off-campus hous-
ing and co-education.
Do you plan to inform the

, Student body in advance of

issues to be considered at
Wednesday senate meetings
and to keep the students in-
formed of action taken at
meetings.

Amen, brother, insofar as
THE DAVIDSONIAN . and
WDAV can cooperate. I al-
so hope to.be able to en-
courage more students to at-

--tend Senate ~and committee ~~

meetings. Mass support pre-
supposes ‘possession of in-
formation.

Do you support a compro-
mise on the fraternity ques-
tion?
one—an 8-4 system or simp-
ly the right of students to
eat in fraternity houses off
campus?

‘lf by
mean allowing selective na-
tional, fraternities to remain

If so, how much of —

“‘compromise’’. you

on campus, the answer is
no. I intend to support the
right of fraternities that
wish to operate eating faci-
lities off campus as well as
the right of individuals who
wish to remain ‘‘indepen-
dent” of any of the college-
sponsored options. The col-
lege is already taking steps
with regard to ‘‘fine tuning’’
of the random assignment
plan. *

.. Explain the proposal for

a “College Council’’ and
where you stand on it.

Simply: stated, the College
Council reflects a more
realistic allocation of deci-
sion-making responsibilities
in terms of what various
groups have at stake here.
It is an idea I have been
mulling over since the mid-
fall term and one which I
see as having® potential for
stabilizing the basis.of .stu-
dent power. We will defi-
nitely push the, idea.
