points, five in the 100-vard dash, and
five in the 220, and three in the shot put.

his discus record of 104 feet, with 109

put record with 35 feet 4% inches.

ment of the two managers. This meet

Last Game of Season
Results In Victory

at Hands of Lecals.

Davidson closed her 1916 base ball
season Thursday by defeating Washing-
ton and Lee University 13 to 2, mak-
ing a total of fifteen victories and three
defeats in games with other colleges.
The Red and Black outclassed the Gen-
erals in all departments and were not
seriously threatened in any period of the
game. Hengeveld went the full route -
for Davidson, having the visitors at his
mercy thruout. He allowed but five
hits, scattered thru as many innings, and
struck out ten of the W. & L: sluggers.

Washington and Lee made her total
number of runs in the fourth on a pass,
Barrett's triple and an error by Johnson.
Graham, the visitor's twirler, was hit
hard and showed a good deal of wild-
ness, the Davidson sluggers finding him
for t1 hits for a total of 20 bases, He
pitched well in the pinches, however,
and had it net been tor miserable support
the score would have undoubtedly been
much closer.

Black was the hitting star of the game.

1 He contributed a single, triple and home

run out of five trips to the plate. Wood
also hit well, getting two out of four.
Brown celebrated the closing of his base
ball career at) Davidson by accepting
three hard chances and getting a single
and double out of ‘three times up. Bar-
rett and Jones led the hitting for the
Generals, getting two hits apiece, but
their unsteadiness in the field contrib-
uted largely to their team’s defeat, Cal-
loway caught a good game for Washing-
ton and Lee, while Captain Alford
plaved his usual stellar game behind the
bat for Davidson.

RISING SOPHOMORE
CLASS ACTION

One of the most significant signs of
the feeling on the campus regarding any
forms of organized hazing is to be seen
in the action of the rising Sophomores—
the present Freshman class. At a meet-
ing of the class for the election of officers
for next year and consideration of other
matters, the question was brought up of
what the attitude of the class would be
in regard to this question when they re-
turned next Fall.

The question was discussed by dif-
ferent members, and the class went on
record as stating that thev will uniform-
ly follow out the previous action of the
student body in this matter—which is,
that hazing in all its forms shall be abol-
ished, and that they will as a class see
that order is preserved.
