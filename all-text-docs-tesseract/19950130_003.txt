Snyder meets her bone

marrow recipient.three years
after saving his life

By Mary Clare Jalonick

In April, 1993, Senior Megan
Snyder donated bone moarrow to a
44-year-old father dying of chronic
leukemia. After communicating
for two years, Megan finally met
her recipient, Richard Soucey, last
Thursday. That night, the two
. talked before an intimate crowd
about theirexperience. Megan told
her part of the story, describing the
operation and her feelings as it
neared. Soucey gave his thanks to
Snyder, describing her as “the link
that makes me whole again.”

Davidsonian News Editor
Mary Clare Jalonick interviewed
Snyder and Soucey to give those
unable to attend the event a close
and personal look at the impact
and importance of the Davidson
Bone Marrow drive.
When you had your bone marrow
typed, did you ever consider that
something like this could hap-
pen?
Snyder: No, I really didn’t even
know what it was.

Did you ever have any doubts
about doing it?

Soucey:It was all excitement. At
first I didn’t really know [about the
procedure], and I was told by
friends that it was extemely pain-
ful. It turns out that they used to
take the marrow from the spine,
but they took mine from the pelvic
bone, and it is now much less pain-
ful.

So there were never any doubts?
Snyder: There was never any pres-
sure from the Red Cross; they
essentially try to talk you out of it.
But for me, it was something I
wanted to do.
Was there a risk of death?
Snyder: Only the general risk from
anesthesia.

When did you find out who Rich
was?

Snyder: At first I only knew his
first name — when I got a letter
from him [in the hospital]. After a
year, I got his full name and ad-
dress, and we wrote and talked on
the phone.

Megan Snyder and Richard Soucey, the recipient of Megan's life-saving marrow.

Did you really think that you had
a chance of finding a donor?
Soucey: At first I was confident
that I would, but then [the Red
Cross] kept finding initial matches
and then the second or third test
would prove reactive. It got to the
point where I really didn’t know, it
was becoming a pattern. The more
times that that that happened the
less sure I became.

Did you ever think that you would
meet Megan?

Soucey: Certainly. We were des-
tined to meet.

Were you both a little nervous
about meeting?

Snyder and Soucey: Yes, defi-
nitely. j

What does it feel like to know that
your blood is keeping him alive?
Snyder: If he was to have his blood

taken, he would be typed as a fe-
male. He even has my allergies
now — it’s kind of strange to think
about. ‘
Some people would call you a
hero.

Snyder: Rich’s stitation seems a
lot more heroic; I was just lucky
enough to have a match in the first
place. It’s just neat to know I saved
someone’s life.

Scholarship
created for
environmental
awareness

By Mary Clare Jalonick &
Russ Tarver”

Students for an Energy Effi-
cient Environment, a global aware-
ness. organization, has created a
scholarship for those students who
want to increase environmental
awareness at Davidson.

The “on-campus internship”
gives students concerned about en-
vironmentalism on their campus a
chance to do something about it.
Those accepted will receive $1,000
spending money in addition to
funds to create environmental pro-
grams at their individual schools.
The winners will also travel to
Washington, D.C.

SGA President Eric
Rosenbach believes that this schol-
arship can be significant to
Davidson. He says the college
needs inventive minds to focus on
environmental problems because
“there is a definite lack of environ-
mentalism on campus.”

The application process is
“relatively easy,” says Rosenbach.
Students must get a faculty recom-
mendation and write an essay.
Those who are not science studs
can breathe easy. “You don’t need
experience ina particular academic
areato apply,” Rosenbach stresses:

Students interested in apply-
ing for the scholarship can contact
Rosenbach for further details.
Those wishing to contact SEEE
directly can call (617) 493-6271.

“fine @susc.harvard.edu.”

SLAC holds first meeting

By Mary Clare Jalonick

The Sophomore Life Action
Committee — SLAC — held its
first informal lecture Thursday for
sophomores interested in becom-
ing hall counselors or resident ad-
visors.

Current hall counselors and
R.A.s attended the meeting in or-
der to give sophomores a little in-
sight into their jobs. According to
Sophomore Class President War-
ren Buford, “The idea of SLAC is
to get students to talk to students.”

In the meeting students dis-
cussed the rigorous application
process, hall counselor roommate
selection, staying at Davidson. for

’ the entire junior year, and enforc-

ing the alcohol policy. The speak-
ers all encouraged sophomores to

apply.

Hall Counselor Bob Bailey
spoke of his duties, saying that
reaching out to freshmen helped
him “get back in touch with
Davidson.”

Hall Counselor Bill Gullan
told the group that he has formed
unique friendships with those on
his hall and compared the experi-
ence to being abroad in that “you
learn to approach things in a differ-
ent way.”

Resident Advisor John Hollan
told the group that his job “is “a
good chance to know your class-
mates.” He pointed out that his job

differs from a hall counselor be-

the role of co

nfidant.

Sophomore senator David
Wick looked favorably on this first
meeting. “It was a good discus-
sion. We generated something very
positive.”

Buford adds, “I think they
answered some questions sopho-
mores could not find out at the
Residence Life Office. If we can
get more people to come to the
next meeting it will be even bet-
ter.”

Topics to be discussed in fu-
ture SLAC meetings will include
study abroad plans, summer work
plans, and major selections.
