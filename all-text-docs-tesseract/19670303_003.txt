Denominational Control
No Bar To Excellence

Dear Editor:

Regarding your editorial en-
titled “Reform The Board” in
the Feb. 10 issue, I thank you
as a trustee for your obvious
interest in upgrading David-
son College.

My question is, can you
change the basic stance of the
school and still have D. C. as
it was envisioned to be? True,
the College is operated by the
Presbyterian denomination,
but its objectives exceed any
“parochial’’ limits.

Our ‘Statement of Purpose’

maintains: “The primary
loyalty of the college extends
beyond the bounds of denom-
ination to the Christian Com-
munity as a whole, through
which medium it would seek to
serve the world.” I don't be-
lieve the increasing “lay con-
trol” you applauded in the
Catholic schools could be any
more ecumenical than that.
Davidson does not need any
legal separation from her
controlling denomination in
her efforts toward excellence.
Both are committed to honor

Frustrated Senior Muses

A FRUSTRATED college senior, one who has once
again been brought back to reality, one who is remind-
ed for the last time, perhaps, that few of us.are able to
build revolutions, to move mountains; this is the posi-
tion I find myself in.

I suppose that all of us pursue our own personal
panaceas in our own individual fancies. I never have
thought Davidson College was perfect, but I have
always felt that it has the potential of attaining a place
at the top in the ranks of professional educational in-
stitutions. I still believe that we will get there even if
it does take much longer than is necessary. In the
interim, deliver me from cynicism.

THE FRATERNITY system at Davidson has
changed drastically during the past four years. It has
been well established that there must be a significant
place provided for the independent within the social
framework of the college. The Independent has a-
chieved a certain amount of stature (or is this merely
a.different perspective speaking?) At any rate, I am
firmly convinced that there is real concern for the wel-
fare of the 25 per cent of the student body which is not
affilated with the fraternity system.

I think that a willingness to cope with the situation
effectively has been evinced widely by the fraternities.
The faculty and administration may have provided the
necessary initial coercion, but it has since dragged its
heels and left most of the work to the students.

" * *

I SUPPOSE I share the hope of every faculty mem-
ber that it becomes the job of the faculty and adminis-
tration to provide for the social needs of the student
body. If there were no fraternities what would fill the
void? Yes, faculty, you had better hold on to this
bastion; I certainly have never argued for its abolition,
nor would I. But change is a different matter.

Change takes time. There is no easy way to change

long-standing institution. I suppose even the liberal
has a certain conservative bias: Why alter what seems Soldier’s Death Cc alle d

to be working?” But we have seen a willingness on the
part of fraternities to include the independent in much
of their activities. Social affiliation is becoming more
and more of a real alternative for the Davidson student.
And the hoped-for program of 100 per cent opportunity
for social affiliation seems about to become a reality.
There is more recognition than ever before that the
fraternity is NOT the “only way to go.”

* s 2

SO WHAT IS the complaint? Well, it isn’t new,
and it hasn’t been answered. I have quit asking for an
answer for myself. But some day it will have to be
faced. Davidson College is committed to the Christian
faith. In effect, the college subsidizes the fraternity
system. The idea that any student can be denied com-
plete participation in such arms of the college is in-
compatible with the commitment of the college. It is
that simple. I can see no advantage that accrues from.
this tacit approval of the principle of rejection.

The fraternity system has never had anything to
fear from me. And the next step of the change is on its
way. The system obviously has nothing to fear from the
faculty. So thank goodness for those people within the
system who are willing to give an honest and realistic
appraisal of their place in the Davidson College com-
munity. These are the people who will make the change,
and they are the ones to be congratulated.

* * e

THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION has given me the
chance to become a prophet. In time, I prophecy, the
incongruence that I noted above will disappear, not the
fraternity system, just the system as we know it. And
the system itself will be the hero because the ones with
the authority to make the change have abdicated their
authority; expediency has taken precedence over right.
But enough of a political diatribe.

* % s

I GUESS all I have wanted in all of this was to
hear a valid explanation from the faculty or the admin-
istration. If only someone had called me quietly into
his office and said: “Look, John; this is the way it
is...." I might have been quiet. Well, things are
going to change, but I’m convinced that the change will
be slower than is warranted.

The liberal arts education is relentless. It pursues
you in every area of your life, and this is why it is so
important. Discussion of the fraternity problem as I
view it has returned me to the down-to-earth world of
realism. Maybe I will be able to realize at long last that
personal desires and feelings about what is right can’t
always be answered clearly. And sometimes there is
nothing one can do except relax and wait and hope the
cards will fall his way at long last.

* s s

IN A SENSE this is part of my legacy. I wasn't
able to draw a final solution, but perhaps there has

been something of a contribution to the over-all pro-

cess. So, I look ahead.

Him who said, “You will
know the truth, and the truth
will make you free.”’

This concern is again
echoed in the Statement of
Purpose: ‘Davidson is dedi-
cated to the quest for truth
and would set no limits on
the adventures of the mind.
Hence, it encourages teach-
ers and students to explore
the facts of the universe
through the full and dedicat-
ed use of their intellectual
powers.”

The Board of Trustees,
while understandably condi-
tioned by our church rela-
tions, is largely independent
of the presbyteries in terms
of any dominating control.

Rather, we are bound by
our basic Christian convic-
tions and our vow ". . . to be
faithful in promoting the pur-
pose of the College and in
seeking to increase its ef-
fectiveness as an institution
of Christian learning.”

You wrote, ‘‘To release the
Board of Trustees from their
ties to the Southern Presby-
terian Church would be one
step toward making the
school more Christian and.
less Presbyterian.”

I for one believe it is pos-
-Sible to be both! In any case
how would you rephrase the
Statement of Purpose for Da-
vidson College or the Trustee
vows to improve on them? If
you suggest a change, give
us a choice.

Open Letter Reveals

‘Blind, Stupid Fears’

(ED. NOTE: The following
is an open letter to the edi-
tor of The Florence Times
in response to her open letter
of last week in which she cri-
ticized the college for hosting
an official of the Russian em-
bassy on campus early in Feb-
ruary.)

Dear Editor:

The undersigned wish to ac-
cept the challenge which pub-
lisher Lawton levels at the
“American Student at a Pres-
byterian Church College.”

In thinking for ourselves and
so speaking, we represent
three branches of ‘our coun-
try's armed forces. We are
neither pacifists nor reaction-

aries: we are merely opposed
to stupidity.

We are ‘young, but not too
young to learn the difference
between freedom and abuse”’
in publisher Lawton's words—
neither are we too young to
fight. ;

We would merely ask if pub
lisher Lawton has .grown too
old to wish that there might be
some other solution to interna-
tional problems than the pres.
ent bloodshed.

In publisher Lawton's esti-
mation, permitting a “bolshe-
vic’’ to speak on an American
campus is an abuse; as
he (she?) melodramatically
terms it ‘why should this pur-
veyor of darkness be hosted by

Patriotic Attestation

Dear Editor,

The editorial section of last
week's DAVIDSONIAN con-
tained an article with refer-
ence to the tragic death of an
American soldier in Vietnam.
I think every American has
debated the war we're waging,
but your article is most re-
grettable.

While not being sure of our-
selves in Vietnam, we are all
proud of the courage shown
by these men. I find it hard
to believe that you do not cred-
it the soldier's statement to
patriotism.

Mr. Editor, to my mind.
this is the highest class of
patriotism there is. I have had
the opportunity to talk to four
boys who have recently re-
turned from this war and they
were in unanimous support of
its purpose. There was no
doubt in their minds that this
was a war for personal free-
dom.

Who are you, Mr. Editor. to
question the patriotism of a
man who has given his life for
his country? As for me, I have
a guilty feeling when I think
about these boys—these men

who are fighting while I re-
main here in protective David-
son.

Your statement that ‘‘for him
to have died for a politically
contrived debacle is sickening”
is one of the most discourag-
ing statements I have ever
read. Patriotism is most def-
initely a question here.

Who is to say his death is
“sickening?*’ He believed in
his purpose in Vietnam. and
he died for that purpose. It is
not enough to admire this
soldier's sincerity and cour-
age. Why do you say the army
is indoctrinating its forces with
false conceptions?

Church and Country?"

The answer is, we maintain,
that the greater abuse is not
a learned, literate, Soviet dip.
lomat speaking in calm ration-
al language on a campus such
as ours, but the blind bigotry
of those who would prevent the
understanding between men.
which such a speaker pro
motes.

We maintain that publisher
Lawton’s flag waving and
drum beating is not patriotism
as we see it and would fight
for it, but blind, stupid fears
of the sort which cause the
very wars which interest and
understanding of the sort pro-
moted by such speakers as Mr.
Stepunin may prevent.

We value our country’s heri-
tage and take pride in calling
ourselves Americans, yet we
would work to see the sense:
less slaughter of Americans
and “‘bolshevics’ alike cease
once and for all.

It might be well that we all
took to heart the words of Mrs.
John F. Kennedy. who, in a
letter to Chairman Khrushchev
on Dec. 1, 1963, wrote, ‘‘While
big men know the needs for
self-control and restraint—lit-
tle men are sometimes moved
by fear and pride. If only in
the future the big men can con-
tinue to make the little. ones
sit down and talk, before they
start to fight.”

We are young men; can we
not be big men?

Sincerely,

says, challenges’ the college
to the double duty of further-
ing high school education and
providing opportunities for
guided study under the in-
dependent-study plan.

It is apparent that Stephen-
son makes his evaluation
from a comparison of edu-
cational systems in that his
description of the college fits
just about any average col-
lege in the American system.
This approach fails to recog-
nize that a number of col-
leges envision a goal some-
what above the goals of the
system.

These are the ones which
try to provide the student
with the special experience
of identifying with the col-
lege. These colleges speak of
such ideals as the’ identity of
the college, class unity, and
the product (cf. “The Da-
vidson Product’’ in the Col-
lege Catalog).

I am _ not saying these
ideals should be the founda
tion of an education, but I
think they indicate that some
colleges consider for them
selves a role above that of
the average college. (My
choice of the word ‘‘above"’
is not to identify moral val-
ues but to use the traditional
view of the realm of ideals.)

‘Davidson College does not
fit the description of the aver-
age American college. One ar-
gument often given in support
of this contention is that Da-
vidson is more rigorous aca-
demically than average.

This point of view, how-
ever, would merely mean
that Davidson’ is a_ leader
among other colleges. from
which it does not essentially
differ. A challenge to David-
son to provide independent
study as well as the teaching
of core material is actually
a challenge to the entire sys-
tem.

The only justification for
directing it at Davidson in
particular would be that
Davidson, because of its ad-
vanced position would have
to face the problem first.

Davidson’ promises more
than academic rigor, how-
ever. To many who chase

SUMMARIZES PROGRESS
Reekin Recalls Tenure

Collegiate Press Service

Governor Reekin sat back
in his chair and watched the
rain. He had just finished his
fifth term as Governor.

He picked up the newspaper
and read a page 52 story ‘‘For-
mer University California
president Clark Curr died yes-
terday.”’

“Ha!,"’ he snorted, ‘‘serves
him right.”

“What serves who right?"
Reekin’s wife Nancy asked.

“Curr died. Serves him
right.” Reekin smiled.
“Poor Curr,"’ Mrs. Reekin

said, returning her husband’s
smile, “he never really caught
on to what education was all
about.”

“Remember when I first
took office?'’ Reekin asked.
“All those radicals were at
Berkeley then and Curr was

. their leader. First we got rid

of Curr, then the radicals, then
Berkeley."

“Yes, it certainly is much
better as an agricultural sta-
tion now than it ever was as a
University,’ Mrs. Reekin add-
ed.

“Cows in Berkeley?"’ Reekin
was doubled up with laughter.

“Your tuition proposals were
good too, After you made your
famous speech in 1970, ‘Why
Stop at $400?° there was noth-
ing they could do." Mrs. Reek-

“in's eyes twinkled with delight.

“Well, those boys and girls
had to learn to pay for what
they were getting. Actually,
$2000 per semester was never
out of anyone’s income brac-
ket. To pay any less would be
the same as stealing.”

“‘Remember how enrollment
dropped from 87,000 to 15007
The University was at its
finest hour. Too bad all the

professors left, though.”

“But all the football coaches
stayed, Nancy, and that’s what
counts, UCLA won the Rose
Bowl for 11 years straight.
They even beat the Green Bay
Packers one year.”

“It was marvelous, Ronnie.
but if Curr had stayed it never
could have happened.”’

“Curr didn’t like football: he
was incomprehensible. Why,
when I went to Eureka Col-
lege, we had things like Eng-
lish and history. but we had
football too. In fact. I majored
in the theory of football."

“I always hated the name
multiversity anyway. The
‘multipigskin’ was a much bet-
ter name.”

“Football was practical.
Nancy, and Curr could never
see that. He wasn't practical.

Davidson and similar liberal
arts colleges, it was a chance
to step out of the American
system for four years for the
special experience of the lfb-
eral arts community.

As a matter of fact, few of
them will be able to continue
the experience past their col-
lege years because their per-
sonal and social responsibili-
ties will necessitate their re-
turn to various positions
within the structure of so-
ciety.

From my point of view the
challenge that Davidson fill
a role as an intermediate in-
stitution in the educational
system neglects the special
function the college can per-
form.

In accord with Stephenson
1 would of course base my
challenge to Davidson still on
the academics of college edu-
cation, for the college should
be primarily interested in the
character of its academic
community rather than its
Christian identity or the ideal
of the Gentleman.

Instead of academic rigor,
however, I think Davidson
should incorporate the ideal
which is found in the Ger-
man university, but which
Stephenson failed to mention
—academic freedom. The
term may at first seem
vague, but in Germany it is
a well-defined concept which
has been realized in the uni-
versity.

Essentially academic free-
dom means the absence of
authoritarianism in the area
of academics. (My previous
idea—that the term must
mean the students could take
what courses they wanted,
didn't have to attend classes,
and weren't graded—turned
out to be false, or at least
superficial.)

Under the ideal of academ-
ic fréedom the student can
deal with the material from
his own stand-point, whether
it is subjective or objective.
In the German university the
fact that instead of a text-
book, an entire bibliography
is used for a course—like
Humanities at Davidson—is
the first indication of the

possibly get any value from
their education after majoring
in philosophy?”

“The Berkeley Agricultural
Station has produced thous-
ands of excellent farmers,
Ronnie. It was a great idea,”

“Those boys sure can spade
the manure. They'll make fine
citizens." Reekin made quick
little motions with his hands
as if shoveling manure.

“Changing UCLA to a School
of Forestry wasn't such a bad
idea either.”

“And you have to admit that
the Riverside campus is doing
much better as the Institute of
Home Economics.”

“The Police Academy at. the
old Davis campus was just
what. we needed.”

Reekin smiled again. “It's
been great, Nancy, but it's too
bad I never got anyone to take
over as University President."

freedom from authoritarism
academics.

While textbooks tend to
present material dogmatical-
ly and are usually only poor-
ly documented. a good book
in a specific field will have
arguments, both positive and
negative, for a thesis and
thorough documentation.

A second sign of this free-
dom is that the lecture itself
is comprised not of a pro-
fessor's presentation of ma-

‘ terial but of his own thesis,

argumentation. and refer-
ences. The professor as a
rule lectures on the book he
is writing. so the lecture-
room situation is actually a
mixture of academician and
student in each individual, in-
cluding the professor.

T can't say how much the
individual students take ad
vantage of their opportunity
for free study. in the sense
of reading. thinking, and
reacting, as over against
memorizing. With this state-
ment I do not mean to recall
the debate on the role of
facts in education. You have
to have the facts to support
your thesis.

The question here centers
more generally on the educa-
tional process—whether you
learn the facts to support
your argument or to list on a
test. I'm sure some of the
German students make full
use of their opportunities and
could list the facts on a writ.

Others wouldn't be able to
do it. It's a matter of per-
sonal interest and ability.
The German university does-
n't emphasize finding out
quickly personal abilities, as
the American system of writs
and tests does.

It seems to me psychologi-
cally good for the student to
be able to find out his own
limitations for himself and
learn to live within them in-
stead of his being shown up
on a test. It also seems psy-
chologically good to escape
the authoritarianism of edu-
cation in the South that Ed
Dwelle talks about. (DAVID-
SONIAN. Feb. 10).

I would couch a challenge
to Davidson in‘ terms of what
it could be: as an academic
community, embodying the
ideal of academic freedom
through whatever means are
possible in the situation.

Elevating Davidson to this
idealistic role is not to neg-
lect its responsibility as an
educational institution. It is
instead to speak of an educa-
tional goal somewhat above
those of the average Ameri-
can college.

Davidson may not structur-
ally compare with Marburg,
but both institutions are con-
cerned with education. This
one fact provides the oppor-
tunity for an exchange of
ideas between the two.

As Stephenson says, it
would be wrong to try to
make Davidson fit into the
German structure. Still it
should desire to incorporate
the ideas which make up the
strong points of German edu-
cation, in as far as they are
importable, into its own
structural requirements.
