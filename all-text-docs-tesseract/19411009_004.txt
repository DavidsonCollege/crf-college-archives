Ben Lacy and “Red” Bethea are two standouts in the Davidson back-
field. Bethea has been proclaimed as one of the state’s finest kickers,
whereas Lacy, who quarterbacks the team, has been a sensation with

Win Over Strong

Lacy Out; Tigers Boast

W. & L. Generals

The Davidson Wildcats invade the
lair of the Sewanee Wildcats Sat-
urday in an attempt to chalk up
their first win of the season after
two ties and one defeat at the hands
of the powerful Carolina Tar Heels.
For the first time since the year’s
with the Cats will
be favored although the Tigers are
to Be tougher this
than in many past years.

opener Rollins,

going season

Still hampered with injuries, the
Cats will be in better shape than
was anticipated, though, with Davey
Spencer and Don Bell able to go
again against the Tigers.
Was injured in the first half of the
Carolina game and was out for the
larger part of the second half. Bell
received a leg injury and was tak-
en out of the same game but both
these starters will be_ready forthe
opening whistle Saturday in Chatta-
nooga. ~~

Spencer

Tigers Strong

The Tigers will put a strong team
on the field against the Cats and
their 20-19 defeat of -Washington
and Lee shows that. After their
win in the season’s opener, the Tig-
ers had a week off to prepare for
the Cats and they will be
perfect shape for the game, Al-
though they are shy in reserves,
the Tigers can boast of a
starting composed of
nine lettermen with the center and
tailback positions being filled by
sophomores, This team of veterans
won three while losing five against
some of the outstanding teams of
the south in 1940,

The Cats, on the other hand,
are still hampered by injuries to key
men. Claude Hackney and George
Marsh are still out of practice and
some of the other starters are not
in the best of shape. However the
Cats will have an edge in morale
since they defeated the Tigers last
season and recently turned in ex-
cellent performances against State
and Carolina.

Lacy Out

The services of Ben Lacy as first-
string half back and signal caller
will be seriously missed at Chatta-
nooga Saturday. The No, 1 plunger
received painful internal injuries in
the Carolina game last week and
will not be able to make the trip.
Johnny Miller was hurt in the same
game, but will go with the team
and may be able to play.

will see plenty of action this after-
noon

Coach Bolin’s only’ comment on
the "game was, “Our timing is not

of the way this afternoon.”
