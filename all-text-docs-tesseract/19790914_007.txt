Editor's note: No freshman
experience can be called “‘typic-
al and Mike Mason does not
pretend that his is representat-
ive. But because. freshman year
is something new and different
we present one angle. We also
welcome any additional view-
points.

My first day at Davidson, I
discovered that my room was
already occupied. By ants. By
lots of ants. And not just
ordinary ants, either, but ants
who revel in a hedonistic orgy of
crumb discovery day and night.

Not only that, but they insist.
on crawling in my stereo to get
high_w sver I turn up the
volume. few minutes, they
come stumbling and staggering
out of the headphones hole,
apparently good for another 24
hours.

“But of what importance are
ants, ‘‘you upperclass-types
ask, as you inwardly roll your
eyes in contemplation of the
freshmen psyche. Well, consid-
er this, then: because of the
advent of the class of 1983, you
all now hold a captive audience
of some 400 souls who have
never heard your immeasuralby
corny repertoire of Will Terry
jokes.

So let’s have a little respect
for the intrinsic value of the
average freshman, alright? :

But back to the issue at hand.
The ants are but one aspect of.a
blurred montage of sights and
sounds that include other not-
able occurences, such as the
registration deskman who refer-
red to me as an “earthworm”
when he discovered my room
was in the basement.

Then, there is my ever rustic
mother, near hysteria, ‘‘You
mean the showers don’t -have
curtains!’’ Oh well, so much for
the break from parental ties.

After over a week of veteran
experience, however, one thing
stands out more than anything
else. You see, college is the
great mythic panacea—ifyou’ve
got a problem, college cures it
with immense dosages of matu-
rity. “WZ

After all, college is the perfect
environment, and by the time
you get to Davidson, your
Clearasil should’ve joined the
ranks of your teddy bear and
glow-in-the-dark bedspread.

But. not so, buckos! I have
swiftly discovered that I am
who I always was-and whats
more, I like it that way. I
wasn’t looking forward to being
remodeled and fitted with vari-
ous options, anyhow.

Having: only been here a
week, I’ve sounded no deeper
intellectual levels than the abo-
ve, which you may do with as:
you please(might I suggest
swatting ants?) And if anyone
has a can of Raid, let me know.
