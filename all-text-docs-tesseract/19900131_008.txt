(In Good Health

By MARK D. PUCKETT

Exercising is like checking
your mail—day after day
you fritter away good time
trudging to the post office
where you are greeted more
than likely by an empty box.
When you work out all the
time you never really notice
your gains until one day, it
pays off. You look in the
mirror and see a new muscle.
You look in the mirror and
see that the faton your thighs
has disappeared. You climb
the stairs and you are not out
of breath when you reach the
top. One day, the check is in
the mail.

The next time you’re mak-
ing Out an errand list, it
should look something like
this:

Things That I Must Do Today
To Make Myself Feel as if I
Have Actually Hada Busy Day
1) Go to the post office.
2) Drop off laundry.
3) Pick up laundry.
4) Go to the bank.
5) Go to the book store.
6) Going to a go-go.
7) Go fish.
8) Go Exercise.

Chances are, you won’t do
everything on the list. Who

Sorry, I just read the first part
of this article and, boy, is it
stupid. The reason, I think, is
because I didn’t have a thesis
statement when I started writ-
ing and now I’m paying for it.
Nobody should have to read

something that doesn’t have a
thesis—it’s not fair.

Well, have duga holeandas
my grandfather always said,
“When you dig a hole, it’s a
hole; when you fill it back up,
it’s not a hole anymore.”

Therefore, I’m starting over
with a new name:

IN GREAT HEALTH

This week, I have some tips,
which will follow after this

they are

oops,
I guess they’re in invisible ink.
HA HA, got you again. Mon-
keys always look. The fact is
that there are no tips. The tips

What to do when you hate to exercise

lot.

I better stop. I’m playing
around too much-Here are the
tips; they didn’t die in a car
accident. Here they are:

1) Always keep moving dur-
ing the day.

2)If possible, try to eat fouror
five small meals a day as op-
posed to three large meals.
Large meals take longer to di-
gest, which slows you down.

3) Take the stairs when you
go to class, not the elevator.

4) If someone is smoking in
the Union, leave. Or plan todie
early.

5) Don’t eat cheeseburgers
and pizzas at midnight. When
you sleep, your body concen-
trates on sleep, not digestion.

6) Do something at least
three times a week. Play bas-

>

ketball with a friend, wrestle
your roommate, go for a
walk or bike ride on the
cross-country trails, play hall
soccer. Get off your butt and
do something—whatever
you want.

7) If I said it once, I’ve said
it 100 times: if you’re gonna
drink, do it in moderation: If
you go beyond moderation,
you are a weak person. *

Well, | finally gotaround to
those tips and I hope you en-
joyed them as much as! did.
I'll see you next week, and if
you want any free money
before then, just drop by my
room and my roommate, Jon
