Store Manager Karen Toney wonders why more students don’t visit Ben & Jerry’s.

Should a prospective student
pick up a copy of Princeton
Review’s Top 25 Colleges, he or
she might find that one of the things
in the “what’s hot” column for
Davidson College is “town gown
relations.”

Would students and town
members agree?

This question is multifaceted,
and recently it has intensified. Sev-
eral areas of the issue can be ex-
plored, and should be. Thus, we
begin a series of articles that will
examine singular aspects of our

Phyllis Schultz, the owner of

Ben & Jerry’s on Main Street,
doesn’t understand why she sees
so few Davidson students. “The
whole idea is to break down barri-
ers,” she says.

Shetries every day. Asugges-
tion box sits on the counter with a
promised reward to the best stu-
dent suggestion. A sign reading
“Welcome, students!” is posted on
the door. She even began to accept
Visa when it didn’t look like the
Cat Card would work out. Still, the
students don’t seem to come.

She worries that their prices

are too
high.
She
wor-
ries
that
their
hours
are in-
conve-
nient. She worries that students
don’t want to sit in arestaurant with
a family, or an older couple. She
says that her brother once met a
Davidson student skiing and the
student told him that he didn’t visit
his sister’s Ben & Jerry’s because
there were “too many locals” in the
store. “People don’t always want to
see mom, dad, and the kids,” she
says.

Is this really a problem for most
students? It seems silly, but Schultz
sees it as a possible answer to a
confusing question.

So she constantly brainstorms
about just what it is that students
want. Laterhours? Open mic nights?
Coupons? She is open to sugges-
tions, and actively seeks them. “We
want to give the students something
to grab on to,” she says. “It is inter-
esting to try and see what goes on in
a student’s head. It leaves us to
wonder what their motives are.”

Down

in the
Town

One Main Street merchant
looks across the street

Are students too lazy to walk
to the store when pints are avail-
able in the College Union? “This is

a very tiny market,” she says.]|

“There aren’t enough people to
split it.”

“You would think there would
be more of a cooperative spirit,”
she says. “How would the college
feel if this went back to being an
antique store?”

The store does good business
in the town, but Schultz, along
with Davidson store manager
Karen Toney, makes the point that
no business can survive in this area
by taking only one market into
account. “We need all segments of
this community,” she says. “It’s
hard to do business here. There
aren’t many students here and they
leave in the summer.”

“You may get a following,”
adds Toney, “but then they gradu-
ate.”

In order to keep good rela-
tions with the college itself, she
has sponsored “ice cream days”
forcertain activities, suchas Project
Life. On that day, everyone who
bought something at Ben & Jerry’s
donated a portion of the sale to
Project Life. “It was a good start,”
says Schultz, “but alot more could
be done along those lines.”

There is a certain type
of classified ad that Dr.
Adrienne Asch does notlike.

It goes, “Male 20-27,
5’10’’, no familial history
of genetic diseases, college
educated, wanted by infer-
tile couple that desires a fam-
ily.”

Such is the style of ad-
vertisement that is common
in the growing “reproduc-
tive industry.” It includes
sperm donors, egg donors,
surrogate mothers, and
forms of invitro fertilization.

Adrienne Asch speaking on “The
Business of Babymaking.”

The technological and
popular growth of the industry has
led to partially or completely infer-
tile couples paying for someone’s
egg or sperm. —

Asch, a Philosophy professor
at Wellesley college, talked about
this “Business of Babymaking” ina
talk sponsored by the Medical Hu-
manities department last Thursday.

Her talk-did not focus on the
actual industry itself but instead
concerned the ethical value of pay-
ing for eggs or sperm.

Aschsays, “The process should
not be commercialized. [The do-
nors] are not told of the value of the
sperm or eggs. [They sell them] not
knowing they make children [they]
love.

“The people who sell them do
not make informed consent. The act
can not be informed because they
do not know the child.”

Asch said that women, who

" must take drugs to donate theireggs,

will not know what type of psycho-
logical loss they might experience.

She says the young girls who
often donate their eggs trick them-

selves into doing so by saying, “I.

have many [eggs]. So, I take a few

drugs and the nice couple wants to
have a family. What can I lose?”

Asch is against the financial
incentive to helping. probable do-
nors make up their minds.

Furthermore, she does not like
the idealized values that such ad-
vertisements enforce and try to at-
tract.

She also says it takes an em-
phasis away from adoption as a
choice for such couples.

Many audience members ques-
tioned why she would be against
what they thought would mainly
help a couple have a child they
would love.

But, Asch says, “People should
not be rewarded for creating a new
human being.”

Asch offers an analogy to show
the double standard that applies if
society condones payments foreggs
or sperm.

She says, “There is a whole
social problem with teen pregnancy.
If a black girl from the ghetto has a
child, she is [thought] irresponsible
with her eggs. But, if a [less disad-
vantaged] girl hands it out, then she
gets paid.”

Warren Buford congratulated Buster Burke immediately before he made
these remarks to the SGA:
Iam here to stand as someone who will drive us along, hopefully with a smile,
and to listen to each and every concern — from water fountains where the
water just isn’t cold enough to financial aid.
