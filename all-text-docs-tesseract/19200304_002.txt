WILDKITTENS  -DECISIVELY
DEFEAT WINSTON-SALEM.

While the first team was on its
South Carolina trip the scrubs de-
feated the Winston-Salem outfit to
the tune of 40 to 15. The Twin City
boys were outclassed from the start
but put up a game fight. They
were lost on our large floor and
could not stand the onslaught.of our
fast guards.

In the first half Crawford, for
Davidson was the star of the game
caging the ball every time he got
his hand on it. Mauze at center
was also a winning factor getting
most of the tip-off’s, and throwing
four field goals. The feature of the
game was the spectacular guarding
of Price and McAlister, who allowed
only two field goals to get by them
in the first half.

In the second half Davis, C., of
Winston got his bearing and proved
to be a redeeming feature for his
side. He is captain and coach, and
for a while threw a scare into the
Kittens, scoring the only nine points
made by his side that half. The
lightening speed of McAlister and
the impetuosity of Price soon tamed
him down.

A good crowd of students wit-

nessed the game and kept the spirit
up to standard. Everybody ap-
preciated the scrappiness of the
High School boys and were sorry
to see the odds so greatly against
them.

MR. HILL RESIGNS AS
SUPERINTENDENT OF
BUILDING AND GROUNDS

His Five Year Stay Characterized
Faithfulness—R. A. Stiles to
Fill Position.

Mr. Hill who has been with the
college for the past five years as su-
perintendent of buildings and
grounds has resigned and Mr. R. A.
Stiles has been employed to fill the
position thus made vacant.

Mr. Hill has been a familiar figure
on the campus for five years and
leaves many improvements to tes-
tify to his inventive and mechanical
ability. One of the first jobs he
took hold of was to cover and mate-
tially improve the looks of Oak Row
and Elm Row. He then covered
Rumple Dormitory, planted the
shrubbery around the Library, laid
an iron sewer line to replace an
obstructed terra cotta one from the
Library to the rear of the Georgia,
built the present grandstand at the
athletic field (probably the greatest
appreciated work he has done)
finished two of the present Physics
Laboratory rooms, renewed and re-
arranged the plumbing in the Chem-
ival Laboratory, took the two small
water tanks off the roof of the
Chambers, and helped erect the
present 80,000 gallon tank and
tower, dug eight new wells, built
pump-house, substituted a four inch
pipe line for an inadequate one and
one-half inch main, extended the
water system to the gymnasium and
provided fire hydrants accessible to
all buildings, designed and built the
concrete steps in front of the gym-
nasium—fgift of the class of 1918.
Erected the flag-pole—a gift of the
class of 1917. Mr. Hill, in other
words, has been intimately connect-
ed with the physical side of the col-
lege in its rapid growth of the past
five years. We are glad that he and
his family are to continue their
residence in Davidson. Mr. Hill is
an elder in the Presbyterian church
and is ever faithful in religious mat-

ers.
Mr. Stiles the new superintendent
is a Davidson man. For ten years
or longer he was connected with the
Southern Cotton Oil Company, in

by|P. C. lads,

the Davidson branch. For the past
year or more he has been with the
same company at Gibson N.C. Mr.
Stiles is a young man, full of energy
and enthusiasm. He enjoys the con-
fidence of the whole community and
will meet with co-operatiion on the
part of the students in his new work.
Mr. Stiles has not his plans fully
outlined yet but will have an office,
probably at the “shop” where he can
be found when his duties do not call
him elsewhere. All repairs such as,
window glass, packing spigots, etc.,
will be reported to him in person or
deposited at a place he will provide
at his office. Matters of this kind,
will have prompt attention. Mr.'
Stiles will have a phone at home and
later will have one at his office.
Members of the faculty and the iy

town people can communicate with
Mecklen

him matters pertaining to the water
and light plants, etc.

SAY IT WITH
FLOWERS

On the second day of the South
Carolina trip, the Wildcats were set
back by Presbyterian College by a
37 to 30 score. The team fought

hard, but did not display the flash :
similar to that of the preceding night SCHOLTZ, the Florist
when they defeated Wofford. The Charlotte, N. C.

team was at a slight disadvantage ,

caused by the nature of the court, Jetton Drug Company, Agents

there being no out of bounds at eith-
er end and on one side. On the other
hand the P. C. lads showed class at
shooting while near the end walls.
The game started in a rush, both
teams caging some easy shots and

Roberts also scored two shots from

. The second half started slow, but
the Wildcats soon staged a desper-
ate rally, coming up to within a
couple of points of the winners. The
however, came back
strong in the final minutes and won
by a sufficient margin.

The features of the game were the
shooting of Belk for the winners,
scoring 21 points, and of Roberts

The third game of the trip was
lost to Clemson by a 38 to 27 score.
The team traveled all morning and
played in the afternoon, but never-
theless put up a game fight against
their heavier opponents. The play
was rough at all times, fouls being
called repeatedly for charging and
holding.

The game began slowly, but
toward the middle of the first half
both sides began to locate the basket
and the game became faster despite
the frequent fouls called. Schenck
and Colbert led in the scoring for
the Tiger clan. The half ended 23 to
16 in favor of Clemson.

The second half opened up with a
swift Wildcat offensive which
brought them within four points of
the Clemson five. However, at this
stage of the game Romefelt was
knocked out, and also the Tiger de-
fense tightened, the combination of
which was too much for the Wild-
cats and their opponents drew grad-
ually away from them.

The features of the game were the
shooting of Roberts for the losers,
who scored 17 of the team’s points,
and the fast playing of Schenck and
Colbert for the Tiger clan.
