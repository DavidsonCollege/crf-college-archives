THE DAVIDSONIAN

Panel discusses
the Honor Code

By Jerr GOLDMAN

Robert E. Lee, when asked by a
student at what was then Washington
College about the rules of the institution,
said that its one rule was for every student
to conduct him or herself with honor.

Davidson College, however,
wrestled with whether or not the rules on
its campus were sufficient to make sure
such honor is upheld.

On Oct. 8, the campus forum com-
mittee organized a discussion in the 900
Room of the Union to answer any ques-
tions the college community had about
the Honor Code.

The panel consisted of Dean of Stu-
dents Tom Shandley, several members of
the Honor Council — Student Solicitor
Josie Hoover, Chairperson Charlotte
Hildebrand, and Defense Advisor Wesley
Hart — and Mary Thornberry, a Political
Science professor.

Many different ideas and topics were
discussed as the gathering of about 25
people learned much about how exactly
the Code is enforced and what the repre-
sentatives themselves feel about the Honor
system. .

Among the more interesting and
little-known facts about the Honor Coun-
cil is that a board of the faculty, the Re-
view Board, is allowed to review the deci-
sion of the Honor Council and change the
punishment if they deem it appropriate.

The President has the same power.
Both these powers are rarely used, and
when used, they are usually used to give a
more lenient punishment. “The Review
Board can do anything,” Shandley said.

Regarding the possible sanctions the
honor council may impose, Hildebrand
said, “There is a broad range of penalties
- from community service, fines, and sus-

Harding:

pension.” She also wanted to remind stu-
dents that, “(Trials) are not an inquisition.
(It is ) pur (the council’s) responsibility to
uphold the code.”

Shandley wanted to emphasize that
suspension is just about the strictest pen-
alty a student may receive since the col-
lege does not really have an expulsion
policy. “We suspend but do not expel,” he
said.

Nine of 10 cases last year resulted in
suspension.

Dr. Thornberry commented on the
differences in due process between Honor
Code trials and state run trials.

“Ttradically differs,” she said. “Hear-

say evidence can be introduced. We have °

a free, open discovery process.”

Many of the observers did believe
there is work to be done in general to
improve the Honor system.

Thornberry, who believes the differ-
ences are “a good choice” states overall
that we have a “student run system that is
not bad now.”

Last year’s chairperson Ann Hatfield,
who graduated in May, was at the meeting
and said, “The system can be improved.”

Shandley said that anyone could sug-
gest changes for the Codes, by just drop-
ping by a proposal to his office. The
suggestions would then be voted upon by
the Student Conduct Council.

Council representatives also claimed
that the recent sentiment of doubt con-
cerning the Honor Code and Honor Coun-
cil was unfair, and complained that the
recent Davidsonian poll was conducted
unscientifically.

They also noted the scanty atten-
dance of this meeting, compared to the
massive turnout for the Ryan Gist trial.
They claimed that the time to make com-
plaints known to the Honor Council was
at this meeting, rather than during a trial.

So far,

so good on Court

By JENNY HapGoop

A few fights, some property dam-
age, anda couple of trips to the hospital
define Davidson’s Court scene so far
this year.

According to Sergeant David
Harding of the Campus
Police, parties on
Patterson Court have
gone well this year.

The campus police
force is divided into two
squads that rotate from
week to week for the night
shifts at'the Court. Each
night, two officers patrol
the Court, yet they are
nottechnically “on duty.”

Working down at
the parties is an extra task %
the officers take on in ad-
dition to their regular
daily duties. The campus police work
at the parties in order to ensure student
safety, stop fights, and control property
damage.

So far this year, the campus police
have dealt with typical noise violations,
when both residents of Davidson and
students on campus call to complain

@ Harding

about excessive noise from Court ac-
tivities.

Harding has not issued any alco-
hol citations at this point. Alcohol

citations follow the Davidson Red Book
policy, and are issued to students who
are passed out, physically sick, and/or
‘incoherent.

Though this year
has “been calmer” than
last year, Harding ‘has
sent two students to the
hospital. The medic who
arrived at the one of these
occurrences informed
Harding that if the in-
toxicated student had not
received medical atten-
tion, the consequences
would have been fatal.-

Ultimately, the stu-
dent was fine because the
people around him or her
took action and got help.

Harding, above all, wants students
to call the police if they feel someone is
in a dangerous position. “Don’t worry
about getting in trouble, just call,” he
said.

“We're here to help. And after all,
which is worse, getting in a little bit of
trouble or having someone die?”*

Language barrier contrib-
utes to comedy in France

OURS, France — Have you ever

wondered what happens to all
those juniors who disappear for a se-
mester?
While it
might
seem like
we are in
the Ber-
muda :
Triangle (judging from the lack of
mail), most of us are still on this planet.
We can account for 13——the eight
Davidson and five non-Davidson stu-
dents on the Davidson-in-France pro-
gram.

Though we are now settling into
our new homes here, we spent our first
four weeks in Paris, earning the only
Davidson course credit to include a
wine- and cheese-tasting session.

Paris is everything you would
imagine: monuments, museums, parks,
pigeons, and public displays of affec-
tion. The city has just about every-
thing you could want — until you need
it, whether a boulangerie or the public
toilettes, which, unlike in the good old

y

USA, all cost a few francs.

And if that laundry machine—
that’s right, Mom, we do our own—
just ate your 32 FF (five
to six dollars or a really
good, really over-priced
cappucino), you won’t
find an attendant to cry
to. “Service-libre” means
you are on your own in
the cold, cruel world of self-service
laundry.

And then there is the language
barrier. Oddly enough, many times
when you know exactly what you are
saying, the French have no clue. This
phenomenoncan occur in even the seem-
ingly safest situations.

Davidson student A, who will re-
main anonymous under his adopted
French name of Michel, asked for “une
tasse d’eau” (a cup of water) at
McDonald’s and ended up witha Royale
with cheese to go. Vegetarians beware.

As conveniently as pronouncing
an English word with a French accent
filled any vocabulary lack in high school,
here the technique can have different

results.

Deceptively, many words are the
same. Even those of you who don’t
know a “Robert” from a “Mireille”
would have “pas de probleme” figur-
ing out “le silence,” “le stretching et le
jogging,” or, our favorite, “le e-mail.”
Exceptions, however, can be drastic.

In one educational discussion on
American cuisine, Davidson student
B informed her class that “les hot
dogs” are often 50 percent
“preservatifs.”

No matter what volume or pro-
nunciation Davidson student B tried—
-“pre-serva-TIF, pre-SER-va-tif, pre-
ser-V A-tif’—the teacher did not seem
to understand.

Finally, another student informed

student B that she had spent the last
five minutes calling out the French
word for condom.

That’s all the French faux pas for

. how, though we’ re busily at work add-

ing more to the list. Write now before
we are too immersed to write back “en
anglais.”

Au revoir! *

Kenya Connection draws another

alumnus on mission to serve

UANDA, Kenya— With the help
of family and friends, the
Davidsonian has followed me from
Australia
to Africa.
I must ad-

the World.”

The bottom line is that Kenya needs
teachers, and there are numerous re-
sources within the
Davidson community
that can help anyone who
is interested. It is not for

mit thatit
is quite a
thrill get-
ting the
latest from Davidson wherever I go.
However, given my current situation
and. the recent Opinions section (or
lack thereof), I thought I would send

‘word from Kenya, since Davidson is

partly responsible for my teaching
mission.

If you are one of those “gung-ho,
career-minded,. I’m-gonna-make-a-
million-before-I’ m-thirty”. students,
then I encourage you to stop reading
now. However, if you have seen the
light and you cringe at the thought of
Career Services or high-pressure in-
terviews with the latest trendy con-
sulting firm, then lend me your ears.

If you are looking for something
other than the Big Three (medicine,
law, and business), then come to Kenya
after receiving your prestigious di-
ploma from “The Eighth Wonder of

everyone. You make

about $30.00 per month,

and you will have to live
without the comforts of life in the West.
However, we have all surely learned by
now, with our liberal schooling, that
there is more to life than a whopping
pay check.

Western Kenya has attracted over
one hundred DaVidson ‘graduates since
the 1970s through an informal organi-
zation known as the Kenya Connection.
This organization helped make my Af-
rican teaching mission a reality.

I gathered information, names, and
contacts within the Western Province
and then journeyed to Kakamega,
Kenya, in August. I met several head-
masters and visited a few secondary
schools in search of a suitable place to
-begin teaching. I settled at Esalwa
Secondary School near the village of
Luanda, three kilometers north of the
equator. I have found the transition

from student to teacher rather chal-
lenging, though rewarding.

The idea of moving to Africa to
teach can sound intimidating; it’s not.
In fact, it is really quite simple. The
majority of what you need is already in
your head — share the wealth. Any-
one who can survive at Davidson is
capable of being a successful and ef-
fective teacher in Kenya.

Ihave met with many officials in
the education system who always ask
if more Americans are interested in
teaching. I tell these officials that lam
sure there are many students who
would rather come to Kenya than sit
through an LSAT prep course, but
they do not know how. Now you do.

If you are interested in this, please
investigate the Kenya Connection and
begin discovering the realities of East
Africa. In addition to experiencing the
rewards of conducting your own class-
room, you will have three months of
vacation to explore Mt. Kenya, Lake
Turkana, the Masai Mara, Mount
Kilimanjaro, Lake Victoria, and the
tropical coast of the Indian Ocean. I
am anxious to help supply the demand
for teachers in Kenya with enthusias-
tic people from Davidson College.
