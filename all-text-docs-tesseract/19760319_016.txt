Poetry Fair transcends language

By STEVE PEEPLES
Staff Writer

It shouldn’t have worked—but it
was a major success. A multi-lingual
poetry reading lasting for over three
hours on a week night, and it went
without a hitch. Davidson audiences
typically lunge for the door at the first
hint of a break, but nearly all of the
capacity-plus crowd at the 900 Room
stayed last night, and they were
definitely rewarded.

The quick movement from times
and languages created an air of
spontaneity, and, for. me, it was the
greatest lesson in the universality of
artistic expression I’ve ever had. The
lesson was beautifully implicit in the
program -- any attempt at division by

time or language would have brought
on a stifling feeling which this reading
consistently avoided.

A comprehensive review is impos-
sible; all one can hope to do is to
remember some highlights of a
program which never dragged. One
such highlight was Dr. Charles
Dockery’s reading of ‘‘Satchmo’”’ a
French poem by Guy Tirolien in honor
obviously, of Louis’ Armstrong.
Dockery’s verve and feeling were
always evident, and when combined
with an original piece by Todd
Sahlroot on trumpet it got the
audience excited about a poem most
of us couldn’t read. Also accom-
panying on ‘‘Satchmo”’ (and many
other poems) was Jurgen Sottung on

guitar. In addition to his varied and
skillful work on guitar, his under-
stated reading of Rainer Maria Rilke’s
‘‘The Panther’’ ranked (along with
Dr. Charles Lloyd’s: medieval Irish
readings) as one of the most success-
ful poems of the evening.

A state approaching _ real
suspension of language was reached
through Dr. Dirk French’s and Bill
Rolland’s Vedic Sanskrit chant. The
nice words won't do to describe it. It
just plain grabbed you and held you
in amazement at the simplicity of
melody and intricacy of rhythm.
Several of the Japanese readings by
Hisako Shingu had the same effect --
you had to listen and you wished for

Maybe I just don’t know what I’m
talking about, but I couldn’t find
serious fault with anything in the
program. I would say that short
poems which can be emotionally
experienced more easily on first
hearing succeeded better than longer
ones. The extended concentration
necessary for listening to longer
poems was difficult to maintain when
dealing with another language.

This week’s Poetry Fair demon-
strated convincingly the belief of

organizer and guiding spirit Amelia

Dockery: even if we don’t know the
literal meaning of a poem, there is
much we can sense about it and the
reader by giving it a careful, sensitive
listening.
