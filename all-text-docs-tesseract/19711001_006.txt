Draft Makes s New Inroads On Campus

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor

The Selective Service System
has announced that no student
entering college this past sum-
mer or this fall will be eligible
for a student deferment from
the draft.

Those who had been enrolled
full-time during the 1971-72
school year can retain their de-
ferment until they graduate,
reach age 24, or fail to make
satisfactory progress in their
academic work.

President Richard M. Nixon
asked that student deferments
be eliminated when Congress
passed legislation extending the
draft past June 30. Final action
on the bill is pending.

According to Curtis Tarr, Di-
rector of Selective Service,
“Few incoming freshmen stu-
dents are likely to be inducted
in the near future because of
the student deferment phase-
out.”

Curtis explained that of the
approximately 1,034,000 incom-
ing freshmen males, about 80%
are 18 years old and only 20%
are 19 or older. The 18year-
olds will not be subject to in-

duction until 1973, when draft
calls are expected to be low.

At least one half of the 19
year-old freshmen should have
lottery numbers high enough to
preclude their induction. About
50% of those remaining will be
ineligible due to mental, moral,
or physical deferments.

Consequently, a maximum of
50,000 men will be directly af
fected by the student defermen:
phaseout during this year. Of
these, about 25,000 will not be
inducted because of enrollment
in Regular, Reserve, or Nation-
al Guard units, participation in
ROTC programs, or procedural
delays.

Tarr promised that college
students will not be drafted in
the middle of a semester or
term. “If called while enrolled.
they will be allowed to post-
pone their induction until the
end of the semester or term.

“If in their last academic
year, they will be able to pos--
pone their induction until after
graduation.”

Incoming freshmen are ad-
vised not to file applications for
student deferments. ‘If the
pending Selective Service legis-
lation does not pass,’ Tarr said.

“it would now be in a regis-
trant's best interest to obtain a
student deferment which would
extend his liability untli age 35.

“Should Congress change the
legislation to provide for defer-

Student 2-S

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

Students who utilize the new
drop-add options approved last
year by the faculty may unwit-
tingly nullify their student de-
ferments under present Selec-
tive Service laws.

Officials in the Registrar's of-
fice stated recently that the 2-S
classification is applicable only
to those students who are pur-
suing full-time courses of study
at Davidson.

Draft regulations require that
the College notify local boards
whenever a registrant is taking
a less than normal load in any
given term.

Hence, students who elect to
drop a course without adding
another should be aware of the

ments for new incoming fresh-
men, which is most unlikely,
applications for deferments will
not be jeopardized by delaying
their submission until after pas-
sage of the new law.”

Deferments
Now Subject To Drop-Add

jeopardy which their status may
be in.

The registrar's office stated
further than an up-to-date listing
of each student's schedule is
compiled shortly after the start
of each term.

The lists are checked and
students who have reduced their
loads to two courses or less are
labelled as part-time students.

This is a measure that must
be complied with under exist-
ing law. Part-time students are
not eligible for the 2-S classifi-
cation.

Officials from the Charlotte

Draft Office confirmed that
when they receive notification
that a 2S registrant has drop-

ped a course, they begin reclas-
sification procedures at once.

If Congress were not to rein-
state the President’s induction
authority, he could authorize
the induction of those registrants
who hold or have held defer-
ments. In such an unlikely ev-
ent, draft officials believe that
manpower requirements could
be met by inducting those young
men who have recently drop-
ped deferments.

Recent college graduates or
dropouts would make up the
bulk of the inductions.

Davidson ROTC officials sen:
Wednesday a letter to those
sophomores who were not en-
rolled in ROTC last year to sug-
gest a program through which
two years of military science
can be squeezed into one, there-
by assuring those students of
officer classification upon grad-
uation and defermem from the
draft.

Although new freshmen are
most affected by the new de-
ferment procedure, more soph-
omores than freshmen have an
immediate concern for being
drafted because of last sum-
mer’s lottery. Most freshmen
will be in next year's drawing.
therefore not being eligible un-
til 1973.

Career Service: Education On And Off Campus

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

After a wait that took more
time than it did to institute the
Honors College, Davidson has
finally begun development of a
career service program.

Career service is a coopera-
tive education program which
provides students a chance to
spend a term working at a job
that is either career or service
related.

Envisioned by the Blue Sky
Committee four years ago as
an integral part of the curmi-
culum, the program has been
placed under the direction of
Assistant Professor of Econom.
ics Randall Kincaid Jr.

“My job initially will be to
solicit ideas from students, fa-
culty and administrators,” sta-
ted Kincaid, ‘‘and then to draw
up a proposal which incorpor-
ates those ideas.

‘There are many students on
campus who have held intern-
ships and who have had other
experiences which give them
good insights into the way the
program should be developed.
I hope they will share those
ideas with me.”

Career/service, often govern-
ment supported, was designed
to give the student a continuing
education on and off the cam-

pus for several advantageous:

reasons.

First, the program acquainy
the student with the practical

students a chance to finance
their education without drop-
ping out of school.

Finally, the program lends to
the maturing and the perspec
tive of the student. -

Vice-president for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan com-

‘mented on the place of career/

service at Davidson: ‘It will
provide an opportunity for
young men to be out of school
for a term not only to serve but
to test a career choice.

“There will be no academic
credit given, but the student
will have a leave of absence to
work for a social agency, a hos-
pital, a governmental agency.
or even within the college it-
self.”

Bevan added, ‘The program
is set up not just to get the
student out into the world but
to allow him to be in and out
at the same time. This is no
Shuttle system. Career/service
is for those who want and can
work with it.”

Bevan was particularly inter-
ested in the correlation of ca-
reer/service with the extended
studies program.

He speculated that with an
extended studies project and an
independent program a student
might possibly receive a full
term of credit while working at
a career/service job away from
campus that same term.

Bevan said that the two pro
grams would work out especial-
ly well together if the academic
project endorsed by a professor
for extended studies was closely
related to the career/service
job the student is involved with.
In this manner a student is
paid for work which comple-

ments another academic pro
ject that he has undertaken.

“It is inevitable,” Bevan said.
“that these two programs be
intertwined. What is important
is that the academic credit be
defined and approved by a pro-
fessor.”

Bevan has seen career/serv-
ice work. He mentioned the suc-
cess of an intern who worked
with him in higher educatior
out in California a few years
ago. .

He remarked that this win-
ter term nine students will leave
Davidson to participate in a
marine biology research pro-
gram in Wood's Hole, Massa-
chusetts. Each will have an ex-
tended studies project to com-
plement their work.

Bevan has also received re-
quests for students interested
in work which fits in well with
career/ service. Recently he cor-
responded with a camp for em-
otionally disturbed children in
Florida which would like to hire
college students for counseling.
He said this might provide an
excellent career/service project
for psychology majors.

Career/service, one of many
academic interludes being de-
veloped around the country, is
fairly new in liberal arts cok
leges, although it has existed
for over fifty years in engineer-
ing schools.

However, several well-known

liberal arts colleges — Antioch

have such a program.

The Blue Sky Committee sug-
gested that the program be one
involving ‘‘work, service, or re-
search at an off-campus lhoca-
tion.”

The report continues: ‘‘Liv-
ing and working thoughtfully
in a real world of action broad-

ens the traditional pattern of
educational experience and con-
tributes to the development of
self-discipline, self - confidence,
independence, personal under-
standing, social sympathy, and
maturity. The program is a re-
cognition that not all worth-
while educational experiences
have to take place in a class
room.”
