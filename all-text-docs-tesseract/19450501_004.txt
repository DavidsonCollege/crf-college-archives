oe . Lhink On
These Things”

By ED GOLDEN

Last Sunday evening the student
body~heard the Rev. W. M. Boyce
of the First-A. R. P. Church of
Charlotte. Mr. Boyce had two texts,
Hebrews 11:6, “Without faith it is
impossible to please God” and Mark
9:23, “All things are possible to him

who believeth”. These two texts
‘made up the subject on which he
wrote, “Faith is Fundamental.”
Our country is called a Christian
nation, but if we were broken into
our component parts it would be
evident to all that we are as. shal-
low’ and irreligious as can be. The
business men are planning for their
own profits without regard for the
rights of others. The educational
system does not sanction religious
meetings in» the schools. It is not
impossible to please God,.but with-
out faith it is impossible, so follow
the example of Enoch who had faith
and because of his faith was trans-
lated by God. We too can find
God’s purpose for our lives by faith.
Another significant statement: made
by Mr. Boyce was that faith is
fundamental to progress. Progress
is goodness. We must attempt the
impossible. We must ‘give our best,
because God would have us do it

‘What way.’So “Think On This” ALL

THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO
HIM THAT. BELIEVETH.

On Wednegday at chapel. Dr.
Cunningham gave a very impres-
sive talk on the need for prayer
for the meeting that began on the
25th in San Francisco, We seriously.
should “Think On This” and in do-
ing this we need some earnest pray-
ers because as Dr. Cunningham
said, we might be entering into a
new era of the world’s history. So
much depends on the outcome of
this conference because the peace
of the world hangs in the balance.
Prayer is so needed in these critical
times, and who are we to shun our
duty and privilege? By the time
this has come from the press the
issue will have been decided upon
so our prayers go with the David-
sonian to press that God in His in-
finite mercy and power will. give
to those men the power to mould
peace, that will cause all enmity to
the plans for a just and durable
peace and love to fill the hearts of
men in a federation of brotherhood.
Yet thig is impossible unless we
sweep. around our own doorsteps.
So let’s bravely and sincerely face
the problems of the future with con-
fidence in ourselves, but \with faith
in God that His omnipotent spirit
will guide us through the future.
