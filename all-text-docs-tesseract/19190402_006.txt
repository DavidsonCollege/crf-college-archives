The DAVIDSONIAN, April 2, 1919

Actors In Terrible
Tragedy Revealed

Much Interest Manifested in Coming
Trial.

Due to the change in The Davidsonia
staff last week, the violent attempts of
the parties concerned to suppress all
mention of the outrageous occurrence,
and the post war conditions affecting the
press, we were forced to omit one of the
most notorious affairs of the past year.
Various attempts have been. made to
bribe the reporters and to curtail the
freedom of the press, but thanks to the
untiring efforts of the printer’s devil, we
at last have all the details in hand and
herewith present the stark truth to the
public.

The afternoon of March the twenty-
first was fair and cloudless, little presag-
ing the catastrophe which was about to
take place. Harry Bagdad Brown,
Champion Heavy-weight — Lady-Killer
of Rumple Hall, wishing to win the af:
fections of Miss Priscilla Wilson and
still continue to bask in’ the winsome
smiles of Madame Slootitia Forgey, de-
cided to take them both for what is
known, in the uncouth parlance of the
day. as ac“joy-ride.” — Light-hearted in
anticipation of a delightful evening, this
soutig, Adonis repaired to the cheese-snop
of Jew Eliott, the genial village store-
keeper. After much bartering and hag-
gling over pennics, fer the munificent
sum of fourteen cents, Heavy was able
to obtain lease on Lee’s antiquated, cone-
cylinder hay-burner for the afternoon.

Arrayed in his spotless glad-rags, he
appeared before. the ancient columns of
Chambers, gaily caroling a call to his
fair lady friends, After a reasonable wait
6f an hour and a half, these maidens,
having completed an extensive — toilet,
appeared atraved like lilies of the field.
Right gallantly were they assisted into
the shay by Burnell. After all -were
comlortably settled Heavy threw in the
clutch, hit the differential of his steed
a mighty whack and they were off.

And here, gentle reader. enters the

the legal’ gait of three miles per hour,
and thas being able to take in the scenic
beauty of the surrounding country-side,
and wishing to exhibit to his fair com-
panions his skill and daring, soon cast

rate of speed. “‘Vhey whirled around the

With agonizing shricks Miss Priscilla
and Madame Slootitia flew indecorously
thru the unresisting atmosphere to the
hard, hard ground, exposing their pre-
dicament to the callous crowd of gap-
