Wildcats Rally for First Win

By BRUCE PAGE

Davidson’s football team
evened their record with a dra-
matic come-from-bchind victory
on the road at Millsaps, in Jackson,
Miss. Saturday. The Wildcats(1-
1) beat the Majors(0-1) 24-13 after
an incredible second half perform-
ance, whichculminated in 18 fourth
quarter points.

The Cats were down 7-6 at the
half, and Millsaps outscored
Davidson 7-0 in the third quarter.
Suill, Davidson overcame a 98

degree ficld temperature and put
together one of the best comeback
wins in recent school history.

The series which turned the
game around for the Wildcats
began in the fourth quarter with
Davidson starting from its own 1-
yard line. Senior quarterback Mark
Wainrightcame off of the bench to
engineer a 99-yard scoring drive.
Senior running back Terry Hines
scored two touchdowns, including
the go ahead points.

The Davidson coaching staff
also commended defensive play-
ers Steve Veitch, Mike Noonam,

and Alden Smith for their perform-
ances. Smith recovered an onsides
kick which led toa Wildcats touch-
down.

Obviously, coach Dave Fagg
was exubcrant over his first win
since returning to Davidsonas head
football coach. Still, he has.com-
mented that the team will have to
improve their turnover ratio if they
wish to keep winning. The Wild-
cats will play for their second
consecutive victory this Saturday
when they host cross-county rival
J.C. Smith at Richardson field.
Kickoff is at 1:00 p.m.

Wildcats Go For Two Straight
Versus Johnson C. Smith _

By BRUCE BALESTIER

After their comeback victory
at Millsaps, the Wildcats look for
their second win Saturday against
Johnson C. Smith. The athletic
Bullsconcern Davidson head coach
Dave Fagg: “On paper, the Johnson
C. Smith game looks like another

talented as any team we play. They
have a great quarterback in Mau-
rice Flowers and great speed at the
skill positions.” The Bulls opened
their season last week with a 27-6
setback at Virginia Union.
Saturday’s game will be the
second, and likely the last, meet-
ing between the teams. “Given my
choiceI wouldn’tdo it (nextyear),”

coach Fagg told the Charlotte

Touchdown Club Tuesday. The
Division III Wildcats may soon be
no match for the Division II Bulls.
Last year’s mecting between
Davidson and Smith went down to
the wire.

The ‘Cats went ahead 15-12
ona 20-yard touchdown pass with
32 seconds left, buta20-yard touch-
down pass with 2 seconds left gave
the Bulls an 18-15 victory

Women's Field Hockey-

Field Hockey Defeats
Catawba College 5-2.

By LARRY DAGENHART

On Thursday, September 6, the
Davidson Field Hockey team
opened its season by defeating
Catawba College 5-2. Despite 96
degree heat, tall grass and ubiqui-
tous first game jitters, the Wildcats
came on to dominate the Indians
by getting 17 corner hits through-
out the gameand allowing no shots
on goal during the entire second
half.

Gigi Cooke scored first for
Davidson offan assist by Jacquelin
Ukrop, who about six minutes later,
scored herself on asolo effort. The
score at the half was two apiece.

Two minutes into the second
half, sophomore Jennifer Roos
scored on a direct corner hit- to
make it 3-2. To finish it off, Cooke
netted another on a penalty stroke
and Simone Plaisance dribbled
around the goalkeeper to score

another unassisted goal for the Cats.

Coach Betsy was definitely
pleased with the team’s perform-
ance. “It was a great start to our

* season; our depth really paid off

and kept us going 100 percent,”
she said, referring to the difficulty
of playing in relentless heat and
humidity. “Catawba was not as
intimidating and that made a big
difference. They also hadn’t been

practicing as long,” she added.

The 1-0 Wildcats take the field
this Friday against last year’s Deep
South Tournament Champion and
ACC member Wake Forest. Game
time is ;

4:00 and deserves a strong turnout.

NOTE: In case there is any
confusion about what the Deep
South is, no, it is not the confer-
ence Davidson has recently joined
but a geographical section of the
United States Field Hockey Asso-
ciation, a governing body of
American hockey which is not
affiliated with the NCAA. In this
region, there exists the Southeast
Section of which the Deep South is
a subsct.

The Deep South is mainly an
association league where NCAA
teams such as Davidson, Appala-
chian State and Wake Forest play
against NAIA schools such as
Catawba, Pfeifer College and High
Point College.

These teams all convene fora
tournament in November at which
games are played and all-stars are .
nominated, something Davidson
has had a substantial Amount of
success. os +

According to. coach Pryor, the
Deep South allows for each mem-
berschoolstochallenge themselves
against “national play they
wouldn’t get to otherwise.”

Bruce Balestier | On the Sport Front
Don't Put Television

in Control of Sports

Television’s deathgrip on col-

-lege athletics has been tightening

gradually over the last decade, with
increased coverage and increas-
ingly monstrous contracts to tele-
vise NCAA games. But in the last
year, the impact of that control
upon college sports has become
increasingly evident.

When Notre Dame opted to
sign its own television contract
with NBC, individual schools and
conferences seemed to recognize
the tremendous bargaining power
they could have, not to mention the
great amount of money they stood
to make, if only they could align
themselves in easily marketable,
made-for-TV superconferences,
First, Penn State, a football inde-
pendent and member of the Atlan-
tic 10 in other sports, jumped to the
Big 10. This summer, Arkansas, a
longtime member of the South-
west Conference, leftthe SWC for
the Southeastern Conference. Now,

_ within days, Florida State, pres-

ently a football independent and
member of the Metro Conference,
will likely move to either the At-
lantic Coast Conference or the SEC.
There has been talk, too, of Pac- 10
expansion, acombined Big 8-SWC

anda Super Metroconferencecom-
prised-of Eastern Seaboard foot-~
ball powers.

This means trouble, College
athletic success, especially in bas-
ketball and football, has come to
hinge on recruiting. Recruiting, in
turn, hascome to depend on televi-
sion exposure, for high school
recruits yearn to playon TV. Tele-
vision exposure, if the trend con-
tinues, will soon depend on mem-
bership in a superconference with
a television package of its very
own. Schools outside the super-
conference structure will be for-
gotten, ets

This situation has only been
worsened by CBS’ new $ 1 billion
contract with the NCAA for col-
lege basketball. Basketball pow-
ers like Oklahoma, Michigan and
North Carolina have grown tired
of sharing NCAA Tournamentand
television money with small
schools like Princeton and
Davidson which, from time totime,
receive automatic bids to the Tour-
nament and earn a portion of that
money. The large schools feel that
since they field more teams and
