Greeks’
Pledges

Trained

By GEORGE ALLEN
Associate Ed!tor

The culmniation of Greek
Week in the field day and

regatta held yesterday at the’

lake campus promised frater-
nity initiation for several of
the Davidson pledge classes.

Greek Week is sponsored
by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and, according to IFC
Vice President Dave Wasser-
man, ‘was set up as a weék
of final activities for the dif-
ferent pledge programs.
culminating in initiation at
the end of the week’.

Although the IFC encour-
ages each pledge class to
engage in a constructive ser-
vice project during the week
the only activify directly
sponsored by the IFC is the
field day.

Wasserman said that. the
creditional pleage class ban-
quet- was not held this year
because of a “lack of enthu-
Siasm among the fraterni-
ties for such an activity.”

“Greek Week has become
decentralized lately." Was-
serman continued. ‘It has
become more a province of
each individual fraternity
than an IFC-coordinated pro-
ject. Greek Week should be.
come more centralized.’ he
Said.

A REVIEW
By JOHN PANCAKE
Staff Writer

Dr. Samuel. R. Spencer Jr.
has not spent all of his life
as president of small south-
ern liberal arts colleges. He
is also an author.

One of. his books is called
‘Booker T. Washington. and
the Negro’s Place in Ameri.
ca.”

The book, like the subject
is somewhat outdated. It was
written -in 1955 and was part
of a Series aired at the gen
eral reader who wanted to get
a good look at an individual.
The reputation of the in
dividual Spencer chose has
faitlen on hard times.

In an interview Spencer
recalled with a smile an in-
cident which occurred at

_Mary Baldwin College while

he was president there. John
Hope Franklin, the noted
Negro historian and a good
friend of Spencer's. was
speaking ‘to a group. During
a question and answer session
a Mary Baldwin student
asked Franklin what Book

er T. Washington contributed

to the civil rights - movement.

“Nothing”, Franklin quick-
ly replied.

The reason that. few peo.
ple today have kind words
for Washington. Spencer
points out. is that he was
willing to “accept half a
loaf. as a means toward ob-
taining the whole loaf later."

Spencer contends in his
book that Washington was

moving farther to the left
as he grew older, but the
fact remains that Washingfon
was very much concerned
with presenting fhe proper
image to the white man.

That image was nof too
different from Kipling’s Gun-
ga Din. After Theodore
Roosevelt was elected. in 1904,
Washington. a firm Roose -
velt supporter said. “I shall
‘urge our people everywhere
to manifest their gratitude
by showing a spirit of meek-
ness and ‘usefulness.”

As Spencer sees it, Wash
ington's problem was_ ‘that
he put too much faith in the
goodwill of Southern whités.

“He bet on the wrong
horse." Spencer said. ‘‘He
put his faith in the noblesse
oblige of the Southerners
like Wade Hampton. and as-
sumed that they would. re.
main in power.”

But even the patronizing
attitude of men like Hampton
disappeared. The Negro was
not to have another friend
“until the federal govern-
ment moved into the field
as the champion of civil
rights.” This move came
about the time Spencer's
book was published.

This new outlook is one of
the major changes that has
made for differences in the
civil rights striggle in the
last 15 years.

The other major changes
Spencer believes have taken
place since he wrote his book
are. the shift.in locus from

“If statistics convince...you

get statistics means you're

Two Band Show

By GEORGE PARK
Staff Writer

Two groups, Ars Nova and
Poco, will appear in concert
here at 8 p.m. May 2, Fri-
day of Spring Frolics.

According to “Billboard,”
Ars Nova is one of the most
original new groups in the
rock music field. It features
a totally electric heavy-beat
string sound crossed with
virtuoso jazz, baroque, and
Latin music.

The sextet, five of whom
hail from New York's Man-
nes College of Music, fea-
tures a wide range of talent.

The group’s composer and
rhythm guitarist, Wyatt Day,

group's brass seetion, Sam
Brown leads the guitar sec-

Croom Finds Hardships In
Stay In Isolated Antarctica

By STEPHEN ROADY
Staff Writer

Feel isolated at Davidson?
Then consider John Croom.,
a senior, who as a member of
a 40-man biolégical research
team spent most of the winter
quarter on Anvers Island.
Antarctica, 600 miles south
of the southern tip of South
America.

Croom described Antarctica

no vegetation whatever. save
for some moss here and
there: along the coastline.
Also. Croom said that the
sky. remained overcast dur
ing virtually his entire stay
although the sun never com.
pletely set.

Croom mentioned two big
disappointments of his stay in
Antarctica. The first came
when his group's supply of
beer, whiskey and cigarettes
ran out about two weeks
after their arrival. The se
cond occurred when an Ar-
gentine tourist ship proved
to be toaded with old men
and women rather than

Group Appraises
Campus Writers

A group of Davidson stu
cents and faculty who are in
tcrested in the writing cur-
rently being done on cam-
pis met Tuesday evening at
the home of Dr. Thomas 0.
Pinkerton for an informal
reading and listening session.

The session was one of a
series sponsored by the Eng.
lish Department to encour
age wriling on campus, to
provide a sympathic aud
fence for campus writers
and to provide an atmos
phere for critical discussion
of work being done. Heard
at Tuesday night's session,

well, the faculty member in
charge of setting up the ses.
sions, were the first chapter
of a novel, two short stories,
and a number of poems.

The group tries to meet

approximately every two
weeks.

sessions are an attempt to
fill a void left when Sigma

The Davidson junior facing
narcotics and weapons
charges is both in and out of
court.

Charged with possessing
marijuana, the student has
been bound over to the
Rowan County Superior Court
for trial in May.

On charges of possessing
concealed weapons (a knife

sand ‘a gun), the student was

given a “prayer of judg
ment. °, This means that the
case may be brought up again
within the next three years
if ‘the student commits an
other violation but that the
case will be dropped at the
end of that period otherwise.
The student was found
guilty of possessing mari-
juana on.campus. The Regu
lations Court. sentenced him
to a period of ‘‘disciplinary
probation" for the remainder
of his time at Davidson Col
lege ‘ with any further viola
tion of the Code of Responsi-
bility resulting in immediate
expulsion from college."

Croom busy most of the time.
His most exciting experience
took place when he was low-
ered into the crater of a
volcanic island in osder to
take some water samples.

The weather closed in and
Croom might have been for-
ced to spend the night on the
trembling mass of land, but
his helicopter was able to
pick him up at the appointed
time. The island erupted two
weeks later.

Despite the hardships, Cro-
om said he enjoyed the work
in Antarctica and plans to
return to a different station
there next year to continue
his research.

Students Placed On Presidential Committee

Students at Duke University have joined Duke's
faculty and trustees in a joint committee to find a
successor to retiring President Douglas L. Knight.

The committee will have a majority of trustees,
with several students and faculty. contrasts with
the organization of the recent search for a successor
to Davidson President Emeritus D. Grier Martin, in
which there were three separate committees, one
drawn from each of the three groups.

Each committee winnowed through the lists of
candidates, but several students claimed that the stu-
dents group was not being listened to, although they
did concur in the selection of President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

Elmira Tries Coed Week, Too

Elmira College recently held a co-education week
not dissimilar to the proposed Davidson-Randolph
Macon student exchange.

Elmira, a girl’s school in Elmira, N. Y., invited
120 men students from seven nearby schools to stay
on campus for one week. The students stayed in an
evacuated wing of one dorm, which meant that the
dormitory was co-educational for’ that week.

Participants said that the co-educational dormi-
tory was one of the best parts of the program, since
students and visitors were able to congregate in the
lounge and “form worthwhile relationships on a per-
son-to-person, intellectual basis.”

Harvard Initiates Radicalism Courses

Harvard University has instituted'two courses on
radicalism entitled Social Change in America and
Radical Perspective on Social Change.

Both courses are taught by students and visiting
teachers in a discussion format that avoids the use of
what the ‘Harvard professor who originated the pro-
gram termed “the false intellectual authority of a
podium.”

Theré are 633 students taking the courses, making
them the second most popular courses at Harvard,
and attendance is near 100 percent, but the faculty
has. objected to them on the basis it has insufficient
control over the content and methodology of the
courses.

Student reaction to the faculty attitude took the
form of a meeting of 500 students to request that the
courses be retained.

HEW Moves Against All-Black Programs

The Health, Education and Welfare Departments
have decided to move against all-black dormitories
and study programs on college campuses.

HEW announced it will use its power to withhold
federal funds from schools (under the 1964 Civil
Rights Act) to attack “black only” college activities.

First hit by this ruling was Antioch in Ohio, which
runs a black studies program and dormitory, each
epen only to black students and taught by black pro-

essors.

Hofstra Students Attack Slater

ARA Slater Food Services are under attack at
another university. Hofstra University has set up a
Food Committee to hear student complaints against
the Slater service.

A recent article in the Hofstra Chronicle, the
student newspaper, pointed up several complaints
against the food service. These included cold food,
chopped meat dishes adulterated with bread, and dirty
eating utensils.

Slater also serves the Davidson College Union
cafeteria.

Continuous Service Begun At Winthrop

At Winthrop College another food service, the
SAGA service, has instituted continuous service.

Breakfast is served from 7:15 to 10:30, lunch
from 10:30 to 4:30, and dinner from 4:30 to 6:15.
Students will carry pictured ID cards, and there will
be no restrictions on the number of times a student
may eat.

The policy change was in-
