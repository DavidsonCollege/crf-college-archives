OUR SYLLABLES.

There is no language so beautiful as
our own English tongue, when it _ ts
spoken beautifully. It is a wonderful
possession; but like many other things
which we have always had we underesti-

mate it and abuse it until it is depreci-
ated.

One of the chief ways in which we
mistreat our language i is in over- accent-
ing our words. Foreigners are always
quick to notice this. They find it hard
to understand us because we bring out
the one syllable that is accented and slur
all ithe others. As they say, we “bang
out” the accent, but care nothing about
the rest of the word. By this fault, of
which nearly all Americans are guilty,
the language is robbed of its harmonious
flow as well as of intelligibility.

It is always noticeable that persons of
most culture speak most distinctly; and
this is a mark of breeding that everyonc
can try for. To speak clearly. giving
each word its correct value, indicates a
certain amount of knowledge, while the
opposite way of speeech is often an in-
dex of slovenly habits of thought, if not
illiteracy.—Ohio State Journal.

Horace sat and gnawed his pen, says
Answers, concentrating a look of hatred
on the blank sheet of paper before him.
From his seat he could see others dash-
ing off fluent essays on Henry VIII.
“Two minutes more!’ came from the
teacher. Then Horace, in desperation,
seized his pen and made a bid for fame.

A “Henry VIII was a king of England.

He was born at Anno Domino and he
had sixty wives. The first -he ordered
to be executed, but she was beheaded.
He revoked the second, and the third
died ; and then he married Annie Bowl-
ine, ‘the daughter of Tom Bowling.
When he died he was succeeded on the
throne by his Aunt Marv. Her full
name was Mary. Queen of Scots, or the
Lay of the Last Minstrel.”
