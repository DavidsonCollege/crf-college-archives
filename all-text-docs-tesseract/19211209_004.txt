How about that suit, that overcoat,

that hat, those shoes, shirts, collars, tics,

traveling bags and gloves?

you. need for Christmas, doesn’t it?

I visited Carolina's leading men’s

the latest in togs was.

They are nifty, and yet are sensible. I
believe you will say the same thing after
you have seen them. The same note of
saneness runs thru everything.
coats, shoes and suits alike are built for
appearance, comfort and durability.

All of us wish to make a good appear-

Here's why CAMELS are
the oui cigarette

Ci

R. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY, Winston-Salem, N. C.

ECAUSE we put the utmost quality into this fe

one brand. Camels are as good as it’s pos-
sible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge of
fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.

Nothing is too good for Camels. And bear this
in mind! Everything is done to make Camels the
best cigarette it’s possible to buy. Nothing is done
simply for show.

Take the Camel package for instance. It’s the
most perfect packing science can devise to pro-
tect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy paper
—secure foil wrapping—revenue stamp to seal
the fold and make the package air-tight. . But
there’s nothing flashy about it. You’ll find no
extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.

Such things do not improve the smoke any more
than premiums or coupons. And remember—you
must pay their extra cost or get lowered quality.

If you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest
cigarette you can imagine—and one entirely free
from cigaretty aftertaste,

It’s Camels for you.
