TRACK MEET WITH
CLEMSON SATURDAY

The Clemson-Davidson track meet
will be held on the athletic field Satur-
day at 2:30 o'clock. “Phe events will be
the same as on Field Day. excepting the
two mile run, Due to the fact that Clem-
son did not have the two-mile run and
Davidson did not have the hammer-
throw, both will be omitted.

On account of the showing made by
some of the new men on Field Day,
there will probably be a change in the
line-up. There will be trials on Wednes-
day and ‘Thursday to decide on several
men. In this meet Davidson will have
twelve men. whereas in the other meets
there were only ten. There will he no
delav between the events, as was the case
on Field Day.

THE SHAKESPEAREAN PERFORMANCE.

The Shakespearean performance which
is to be given hy the Senior class at com-
mencement has heen worked up with a
great deal of care hy the class and prom-
ises to be an interesting and unique pro-
duction. The committee on arrangements
for the scenic program, of which L. A.
Mullen is chairman, is preparing for
scenes from “Julius Caesar.” “Henry
the Fourth.” and “Henry the Fighth.”’
These will be staged at dusk on the cam-
pus where the natural beauty of the
campus and the electrical effects will be
most advantageously used as a_back-
ground. The funds received from the
minstrel performance and from the mov-
ing picture shows now being given are
to be used to procure the costumes and
defray the other expenses of the affair.

Ground For Gymnasium

To.Be Broken Soon

Plans Are Being Made For a Hand-
some Building.

A new gymnasium for Davidson, well
equipped and modern in every respect,
is no longer a mere vision to be realized
some time in the indefinite future, but
a building for which plans will be drawn
at once. “The campaign for the adding
of $100,000 to the resources of Davidson
Collepe—$25,000 for a new gymnasium
and $75,000 for additional endowment
—is now practically completed. In fact
the campaign has been brought so nearly
to a successful end that friends and
alumni of the college will not see it fail;
hence the considering of definite plans
for Davidson's new and modern gym-
nasium,

Ground for the foundation of the new
building will be broken at the coming
commencement, for which event a fit-
ting program will later be arranged.
Work on the new structure will be
rushed during the summer months, and
it is expected that by Christmas, at the
latest. the building will be ready for
occupancy.

According to the map of the campus,
drawn by Mr. Nolen some time ago,
the new gymnasium will occupy a posi-
tion just to the rear of the Chambers
building, being in’ a line with Cham-
bers and. as far to the rear as the Phi
Hall is to the front. An indoor basket
hall court, reoms for boxing, ample
lockers and rooms for coaches and visit-
ing teams will be some of its features.
But perhaps the feature most prized by
the students will be the spacious swim-
ming pool which will occupy space on
the pround floor.

In the drawing of plans the modern
features of many of the new gymnasiums
of the South are being carefully consid-
ered, as it is desired that the new build-
ing shall embady as many of them as
possible. “The general plan of the new
‘gvmnasium at Winthrop College, the
plans and. specifications for which were
carefully revised by one of the best con-
sulting architects of the United States,
is especially being studied.

Davidson’s alumni should have a spe-
cil, two-fold reason for attending com-
mencement this vear: {o aid. in celebrat-
ing the successful conclusion of a cam-
paign for additional endowment and to
sce the ground broken for a gymnasium
which Davidson has needed for many
years. The camnaign closes on May 20,
so that there will be no soliciting for the
campaign at commencement.

MOVING PICTURES UNDER
AUSPICES OF SENIORS

On Monday afternoon and night, un-
der the auspices of the Senior class, the
Shakespearean tragedy “Othello” was
shown in moving pictures at the “Mo-
tion Picture Palace.” ‘This is the first
of two productions which the Senior
class is going to present for the benefit
of the Shakesperean pageant which it
will give during commencement.

The second production, which is the
“Life of William Shakespeare,” in four
reels, will be given next Monday.

Rev. Mr. Hough was the guest of
Professor and Mrs. Currie. Sunday.
