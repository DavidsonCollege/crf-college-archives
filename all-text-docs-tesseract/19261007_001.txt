leadership fraternity, in
to formally “tap” the half-dozen
lucky men who will be elected to membership
on the night preceding.

The announcement by. the local circle that
the plan used by most of the circles in the
fraternity will be adopted this year at Da-
vidson came like the proverbial bolt out of
the sky. For years Davidson has béen wad-
dling along in the rut of mediocrity, but now
it steps into the path of greater schools.
Yale has its own yard in which to tap lucky
electates to The Skull and Bones, Carolina
has its historic Memorial Hall in which to
‘stage the Golden Fleece ceremony; David-
son’s first tap-day will’ be held in Shearer
Hall.

The date of the tap-day coincides with
the bid-day for all honorary faternities, set

apart by the Honorary Fraternity Council. |

Following the tapping in Shearer Hall the
bids to the other honorary fraternities at |
Davidosn will be posted in the post office. |

It is expected that the O. D. K. tap-day |
will be one of great excitement, for election
to membership is considered at Davidson
equal in honor only by Phi Beta Kappa. |
There are at the present time nine student |
members of Omieron Delta Kappa at David-
son in addition to a number of members of
the faculty. There are two elections to the |
fraternity each year.

Last spring the following Seniors were
selected: Jim Pinkney, Bill Christian, Bill
Covington, Mac Austin, Joe McConnell,

Pi Kappa Alpha Winner
of Scholarship Award

Given Harper Inter-Fraternity Cup
by Virtue of Scholastic Average
of 85.79

The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity has won
the inter-fraternity cup offered for scholar-
ship, with an average of 85.79 for the school
year 1925-1926. This was almost two points
higher than the closest competitor, the re-

maining contestants’ average varying but
little.
Averages of other fraternities are: Kappa

Alpha, 83.96; Pi Kappa Phi, 83.49; Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, 82.83; Phi Gamma Delta,
82.64; Theta Upsilon Omega, 82.63; Beta
Theta Pi, 82.47; and Kappa Sigma, 80.81.
The general average of the eight nationals is
83.09, which is expected to be greater than
the student body average, which has not yet
been compiled.

Only the national fraternities at Davidson
compete in this contest, the cup rotating ac-
cording to the highest grade of each fra-
ternity. When a group wins it three years
in succession it remains in the possession of
the organization for all time, but so far none
have been able to do this. The cup was
held last year by the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity.

James Cunningham Harper, '15, of Lenoir, |
N. C,, is*the donor of this cup. He was-a}
leader on the campus, in the class room and |
in athletics while at Davidson. The Quips |
and Cranks of 1915 has the following to say |
about him: “Harpy” is a hard student, a|

keeping with the policy of requiring the

cadets to be of actual assistance to both the
college and the town of Davidson, The town
is without an organized fire fighting force
and without adequate machinery and other
facilities for such protection ; because of this
fact it is the purpose of the battalion to fur
nish this protection to both the townspeople
and the college proper.

In the event of fire being discovered either

In the late spring of last year, Dr. Wm. J.

to study the whole social life of the college
as it relates to the campus as a whole and
the relation of this campus life to the outside
public and to the faculty.

As the school session was practically over,
nothing definite resulted from the investiga-
tion of the committee appointed last year,

Proposed Football Pamphlet Gives

Last week a request by three students to

lications Board. This program, to be sold
at the game, was to be edited by Bob Link,
Dick Grey, and Lucien Wells.” It was to be
