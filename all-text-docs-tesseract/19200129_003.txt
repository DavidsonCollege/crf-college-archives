LIONS AND LAZINESS.
DISCUSSED BY BOB MILES

Tells of Helpfulness of Book of
Proverbs.

Mr. Miles gave one of his usual
good talks at the “Y” service Sun-
day night. His text was, Proverbs
26:13-14: “The slothful man saith,
‘There is a lion in the way: a lion
is in the streets.’ As the door turn-
eth upon his hinges, so doth the
slothful upon his bed.” He quoted
William Jennings Bryan's statement
that every young man should read
the thirty-one chapters of the Book
of Proverbs through once a month.
Mr. Miles urged that the students
read the book at least once again,
for it was written for young men
and contains truths closer to our
lives than any other book of the Bi-
ble. It belongs to the group of wis-
dom = books—Job, Psalms, and
Proverbs.

“Every man has a streak of lazi-
ness in him,” said the speaker. He
mentioned three kinds of laziness
found among college students—phy-
sical, mental, and) moral laziness.
Some men are tuo lazy to go out for
athletics, to trv three years if neces-
sary in order to make the Varsity
team. A Frenchman has said, the
best test as to whether or not a man
is lazy is the way he gets out of bed
in the morning. Some men can get
up a fairly good recitation with lit-
tle effort. These should watch that
they dg not fall into mental laziness ;
should put in more time on their
studies and make even better marks.
Moral laziness is exhibited by those
who know what is right but don’t
care to make the effort to live as
they know. They are satisfied when
they have attended the “Y” meeting
and Bible classes, and are too lazy
to live according to strict and high
standards.

Mr. Miles urged that the students
guard against these three forms of
laziness: that they do not look for
excuses as the sluggard docs who
says, “There are lions in the way"
when the catl comes for work and
effort.

“Y” CABINET PLANS FOR
VOLUNTEER CONVENTION

Sullivan and Matthews Added to
Cabinet.

The “Y" cabinet met on last Tues-
day night. The appointment of a
committee to prepare for the Stu-
dent Volunteer Conference, and the
announcement of the program for
Bible classes were the important
things done. -

The committee to prepare for the
conference consists of three men
selected from the cabinet to act with
McClue as chairman. Dans are now
being made by these ‘men for the
reception and entertainment of the
delegates attending the conference.

A plan for the Bible class work
was also mapped out. The first
three Sundays in each month the
topics used for discussion will be in
connection with the regular Sunday
School lesson. The fourth Sunday
in each month problems relatmg to
campus life will he taken up.

Two new members attended this
meeting: W. BL. Sullivan and C. J.
Matthews. Sullivan is the new vice-
president and chairman of the Park-
er fund. Matthews is chairman of
the devotional committee, which will
secure speakers for the “Y.”

THE Y. M. C. A. QUARTET
ADDS MUCH TO
SUNDAY NIGHT MEETINGS

The Davidson Y. M. C. A. has this
year one of the best quartets that
has for vears been in this organiza-
tion. The music which they have so
willingly given on special occasions
has added much to the meetings.
The members of the quartet are
Messrs. H. B. Brown, first tenor;
A. L. Currie, second tenor; A. D.
McArn, baritone, and B. E. Shields,
bass. The more these gentlemen
sing the better are the “Y” meet-
ings.

MINISTERIAL BAND
HEAR DR. WHALING

.

Appearing before the Ministerial
Band Sunday afternoon, Dr. Whal-
ing brought to the band an excellent
message from the subject: “Some
Special Reasons Why the Gospel
Ministry Calls Men in 1920.” This
subject was treated in such a way as
to appeal to not only the members
of the band, but to all others who
may be in doubt as to their life work.
He brought out clearly that: Ist,
“Lverything has been tried out on
this sin-cursed world but has fail-
ed; 2nd, The ethical religions have
proved unsatisfactory; 3rd, That in
the vear of grace, 1920, the ears of
the people are open as never before
to hear the pure Gospel; and finally,
that the call of 1920 was important
because of the nearness of the com-
ing of Christ.”

In developing the question he told
of how it is recorded in the minutes
of one of the societies here, a debate
on the subject: “Resolved, ‘That
the Gospel ministry is the greatest
force in the promotion of civilization
today.” It was in the ‘70s, and the
affirmative was upheld by Thornton
Whaling, while the negative was
supported by Thomas Wilson (bet-
ter known as Woodrow). The af-
firmative won the decision, \nd now
in 1920 he holds the same opinion,
that nothing is so great a service to
‘humanity as the Gospel ministry.

BIBLE CLASSES.

The attendance at the Bible
classes seeims to be falling off, but
asa new book is to be taken up ngxt
Sunday the attendance will probably
improve. Five floors did not have
class. The records for those hold-
ing classes were:

SUNDAY SCHOOLS.

On account of the bad weather
some of the teachers did not go out
to the mission Sunday Schools. The
attendance at Shearer. chapel and
Cornelius was very encouraging and
a great deal of interest is being
shown.

The attendance at the different
schools was as follows:

“Y” BOARD OF CONTROL
‘WD BUY MORE FURNITURE

Constitution to be Drafted Soon.

The board of control of the “Y”
met last Thursday night. This
buard consists of three faculty rep-
resefhitatives: Dr. Arbuckle, Profes-
sor Reed, and Mr. Jackson: two
Seniors: Sullivan and Askew: two
Juniors: Boulware and Schenck, and
Chalmers as president of the ‘Y,”
and Mr. Miles as “Y” secretary. Dr.
Arbuckle as chairman has control of
the financial expenditures of the Y”
and also has charge of the picture
shows. They have decided to pur-
chase a new victrola and more fur-
niture. The $3 fee for the general
expenses of the “Y” has not been
paid by about 70 of the students, and
as many as possibly can are urged
to pay up as the “Y” is badly in need
of funds. The next meeting of the
board will be the first Tuesday in
February, and at that meeting a con-
stitution will be passed on. The
meetings thereafter will be the first
Monday night of each month,

“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then °
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
