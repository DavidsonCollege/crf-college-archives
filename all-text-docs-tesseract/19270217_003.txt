(We are indebted to one of our “fairer
friends” for the following little lyric. We

are glad to know that all the sarcasm of to- |

day is not heaped upon the female tribe, and

we submit to the biting words of this ac- |

cusation with a feeling of guilt. 1 doubt it.)

I Doubt It
When a pair of red lips are up-turned to
your own,

Do you pray for endurance to let them
alone?

Well, maybe you do, but I doubt it.

When a shy little hand you're permitted
to hold,
With a velvetry softness about it,
Do you think you can drop it, with never
a squeeze?
Well, maybe you can, but I doubt it.

When a wonderful waist is in reach of
your arm,
With a beautiful plumpness about it,
Do you argue the point, twixt the good
and the harm,
Well, maybe you do, but I doubt it.

And if by these tricks, you should cap-
ture a heart,
With a womanly sweetness about it,
Will you guard it, and keep
the good part,
Well, maybe you will, but I

should be modified.” Davidson will uphold
the negative.

Freshmen will be given an opportunity to
debate with teams from Carolina about May
Ist, in dual debates. One team from each
college will debate at each place and the
query will probably be, “Resolved, That uni-

form marriage and divorce laws should be
adopted by the United States through na-
tional legislation.” These debates will call
for three freshmen on each team.

Two men will be selected for each team

Hopkins and Duke.
be held as follows: Johns Hopkins, March
Ist; Emory, March 4th; Northern trip,
March 8th; and Sewanee, March 22nd.
Freshman debates will be announced at a
later time.

All men who intend to try-out for one of
these debates are requested to see either
Henry Powell or Don Wharton at once.

AT THE night sessions, when class philosophers
vie with class Merry Andrews in deciding the
heavy problems of the world—or burlesquing
them — notice the royal guest, Prince Albert.
Chiming in with the spirit of the occasion. Fill-
ing the air with the finest tobacco-aroma ever.

Do you smoke Prince Albert? It will bring
you more pleasure and satisfaction than you
ever thought a pipe could give. The instant
you throw back the hinged lid and release that
wonderful P. A. fragrance, you suspect you are
in for some grand smoke-sessions.

The very first pipe-load confirms your sus-
picions. Cool as a gate-tender. Sweet as the
week-end reprieve. Mild as the coffee in Com-
mons—mild, yet with a full body that satisfies
your smoke-taste completely. Get yourself a
tidy red tin this very day,
