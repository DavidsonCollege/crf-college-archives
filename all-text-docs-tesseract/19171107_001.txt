Furman Is Defeated
By Davidson Team

Muddy Field Keeps Down Scoring.
Straight Football Played.

Playing straight football, Davidson
won from the Furman Hornets by the
score of 28 to 7. Tho playing good, hard
football, Furman was unable to stop the
Red and Black machine. The field was
somewhat heavy and prevented the two
teams from showing up at their best.

Davidson won the toss and elected to
receive. Speer kicked to Burns, who
returned §0 yards. Crouch, Spann, Mc-

Alister and Flowers followed with line

bucks and skirted the ends for steady

gains. With first down on Furnian’s
s-yard line, Burns plowed over left
guard for Davidson's first score. Flow

ers kicked goal.

The second quarter was a steady fight
midfield, with no scoring and little of
the spectacular. In the third quarter
Crouch rounded right end for the second
touchdown and Flowers’ toe added an-
other point to D. C.’s score.

In the fourth quarter both teams
really began football. Spann, David.
son's field general, worked his team

down the ‘field, following line smash
with end run, and finally sent Flowers
around left end for the third touchdown.

‘Furman uncovered her best when
Rhame placed two forward passes and
Speer made 20 yards around right end.
Rhame then bucked the line for a touch-
down. Speer kicked goal and ended Fur-
man's scosing.

In the last few minutes of play, Spann
cut loose three passes to King for the
last touchdown of the game. Flowers
kicked goal for the fourth time.

For Furman, Rhame and Speer star-
red, while Burns, Spann, Flowers, King
were the particular stars for Davidson.

LIBERTY BONDS DONATED
TO ENDOWMENT FUND

Every class of Davidson College ha:
bought Liberty Bonds and decided t«
donate them to the Davidson College
Endowment Fund. [t is no unusual
thing for a class of alumni to give i
substantial donation to the college, but
for undergraduate classes to take such
an action is unusual and at the same time
very praiseworthy, Fach class, by tuv
ing a $50.00 Liberty Bond and donat
ing it to the college hase proved both it:
patriotism and its college spirit.

MAGAZINE OUT SOON.

The first issue of the Davidson -Col-
lege Magazine has gone to press and will
make its appearance within a few days.
The uppet-classmen have responded un
usually well with articles for the Maga-
vine, and it promises to be well up to
the standard of former issues. The
Freshmen, however, have failed to con-
tribute, but it is hoped that the next
issue will contain some articles from
them.

Mrs. T. W. Lingle, advisor for wom
en students at the University of North
Carolina. recently attended the meeting
of the State Federation of Women's
Clubs of North Carolina, at Winston-
Salem, and on her return made an ad-
dress in Greensboro to the students of
Greensboro College for Women.

Owing to the fact that Dr. Fulton
will be off the Hill every Saturday.
speaking in the interests of the Y. M. C.
A., Senior English has been changed
from Saturday morning to Friday night
at 7:15, and this will continue till fur-
ther announcement.

is one ot especial interest to Davidson
students: “Irwin Russell’s Poems,”
edited by Dr. Fulton. ‘This book con
tains Russell’s best known poem, “Christ-
imas Night in the Quarters,” and in ad-
dition thirty-nine other poems by this
promising but unfortunate poet. Among
these poems are eight new ones, three of
which have never appeared in print be
fore. “The book contains an introduc:
tion by Joel Chandler Harris, and a
biographical sketch by Dr. Fulton, who
has given much study to Russell’s life.
FE. W. Kemble has drawn) thirty-nine
illustrations for this edition, yet of some
the criticism might be made that they
are lacking in fidelity to the Mississippi
negro.

The book is gotten out in holiday
stile, with blue cover, and border of bluc
tint.

Irwin Russell was “one of the first to
realize the Viterary value of negro char-
acter and dialect.” While he wrote
-ome humorous poems in imitation Trish.
his best work is the presentation of the
negro of his own native Mississippi.
Had his life not been cut shart by death,
he might have praduced even more mem
withle works. As it is. such poems as
“Nebuchadnezzar” and “Dat Peter”
will remain as accurate descriptions of
negro life and thought.

MISS SARAH WOOTEN IS

Davidson Tackles
Auburn Saturday

Aubura Has Uubroken String of
Victories.

Everyone who looks up the dope will
he convinced that the Auburn-Davidson
wame will be a real classic. So far Au-
burn has an unbroken string of victories
— Howard, 53-0: “Ole Miss,” 13-6;
Clemson, 7-0, and Florida, 68-0. On
the other hand, Davidson has played her
heaviest games, and intends to repeat,
for Auburn's benefit, her performance
apainst V. ML. I.

That Auburn has fine material cannot
be denied. Bonner and Caton at tackles
are dangerous against any team. Rog
ers, center: Warren and Sanford, guards, -
with Ducote and Gibson at ends, make
out a heavy, but fast line that will be
hard to manage. Captain Robinson, at
quarter; Revington, at full, and Dono-
hue, Creef and ‘Trapp, at halves, make
up the backfield. Trapp is a new varsity
man, but is one of the fastest men on
the squad, and was last year’s star in
class football. Ducote, of last year’s
All-Southern team. is Auburn's best bet
for punts and end runs. . .

The Auburn team will outweigh
Coach Fetzer’s scrappers, but Davidson's
team will make up in pep all they lack
in other ways. Besides, Davidson has
her “Coach Bill,” who is a team in him
self. With the D.C. line Auburn will
have trouble and against ends like King
and Richardson even the great Ducote
will find his hands full, Burns, Flowers,
Spann, Crouch and McAlister, in’ the
backfield, are sure ground-gainers and
men whom Captain Robinson's men may
well watch.

Auburn will probably line-up as fol-
lows: Ducote, left end; Sanford, Icft
guard: Bonner, left tackle; Rogers, cen.
ter: Warren, right guard; Caton, right
tackle; Gibson, right end; Robinson,
quarterback; Donohue, Creel, Trapp,
halves; Revington, ‘fullback.

STOP! LOOK! READ!
DON’T MISS THIS!

Davidson has one of her hardest
games Saturday. Auburn is no mean
opponent. The game will be a real,
venuine-scrap fram whistle to whistle.
Davidson’s record so far this — season
shews that her team is all right. But
how about her student body? Our team
has the old pep—let’s stir up a little
more pep among the students as a whole.

Davidson’s 10 to 32 versus Georgia
Tech looks good mixed with scores like
Tech 41, Penn. University o; Tech 63,
Washington & Lee, 0; Tech 83, Vandy
0. Don’t such scores show that our team
is here in every sense of the word? Let’s
get out and when our team leaves Friday
night, show them we're behind them,
kick over the old pepper box and give
our Red and Black fighters a send-off
that will show we're behind them, and
show the real “pep” which the student
body undoubtedly has and for which our
college is rightly famous. Kick over the
pepper box and distribute that delicate
condiment all the way to Atlanta and
Auburn
