neither the size of the building

Meetze said, ‘‘An awful ot of

all been involved in (consider-

The need for a dining facility

the old facility was torn down to
make room for the E. H. Little

address the three issues raised
in last week’s issue.

The first issue concerns the
so-called discrepency in the
SGA Presidential election re-
sults. I thought the facts were
presented well in the front page
Davidsonian. news story. The
election was run exactly like
every election has been run
since I’ve been here; the bottom
line is that the spirit fostered by
the Honor Code envelops our
election procedures, as well as
every other aspect of Davidson
life. I won’t speculate about the
motives of those who ques-
tioned the results and requested
that we hold the elections again;
however, if they don’t feel com-
fortable-with the way things are
at. Davidson, that is their
problem, not the SGA’s.

' The-second issue deals with
my encounter with candidate
Bowie in my room (squirreled
tip in the back of the KA house).
Mr. Bowie's logic is quite
_ appropriate here: if one enteres
the realm of politics, he'd better
be-able to stand the pressures
involved. A candidate should be
able to support every statement
and claim he make in his
litérature; if he can’t, he must
answer for his inadequacies.
Mr.. Bowie had a. bountiful

the Editor—
While reading the Davidson
Catalog, I finally realized why I

came to Davidson three and a

half years ago. On page 28, the
Catalog reads, ‘Keen competi-
tion, caqupled with a realistic
level for each sport sets the...
goal... ‘Tennis, golf, and soccer
teams have also won conference .
championships i in recent years.”
Am I disappointed? NO! I love
Davidseri and Davidson people.._

- But I am a little upset that we .«

continue to mislead talented
athletes - by telling them that
Davidson i is the place for them.

For instance, we have some
very  eabaneed soccer S sa Se

track, don’t get your hopes up
over the Davidson Relays—the
college might not rehire 14-year
veteran Sterling Martin.And if
they do keep him, this efficient
nit

nit-picking son of a gun won't
have his former title, while his
duties will probably increase
(diverting his efforts from the
Relays). If you’re a golfer,
forget it. You have to drive 50
miles round trip to practice at
the ‘‘home course.”’ Don’t for-
get to bring your own golf balls
and gas money.

What’s the use of luring good
athletes here—they’ll usually
leave after their sophomore
year. Notable examples are Pete
Legler (football), Scott Gilmore
(golf), and Chris Dodds (basket-
ball). And if they don’t want to
leave, they are welcome to stay
for four years of frustration—
just ask John Gerdy.

‘So let's be realistic; if we.

can’t afford to have oné coach

There are other ways to make
our country stronger and more
secure. A strong economic

structure contributes to nation- .

al security. Bettering the social
conditions in our society would
also contribute to national secu-
rity. More equitable conditions
in which everyone has an accep-
table standard of living,
decent job, and equal oppor-
tunities are important. Some of
our most severe threats come
from with our own society. We

need to devote our efforts to

building for war. This effort.
