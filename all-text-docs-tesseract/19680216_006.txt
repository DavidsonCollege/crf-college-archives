The Student Body Regula-
tions Committee is nearing
completion of its task of re-

courts will interpret.”

The Committee hopes to
have the final draft in the
hands of the faculty and stu-
dents before the Trustees

meet in the spring. Both Mc-
Kelway and Carroll empha-
sized that the regulations
will have a better chance of
being accepted by the facul-

ty and the Trustees if the
student body demonsrates a
willingness to assume a
greater responsibility for its
conduct.

College Presents
Radio Program

Earl (Buck) Lawrimore,
associate director of the col.
lege news bureau, has single.
handedly initiated ‘Sounds
of Davidson,”’ an informative
broadcast of college news, on
a local radio station.

Using his former radio ex
perience. Lawrimore has
used the resources of the
chapel soundroom te record
his latest tapes. Notable
sounds have included the
groans of the new elevator in
Chambers during its first
round trip and the toll of the
Chambers bell.

Lawrimore. in his efforts
to relay tape recordings to
radio stations, used a mild
form of subterfuge with the
telephone.

Not able to wait for the
telephone company to set up
recording equipment for tele-
phone transmission of tapes.
he rigged a device to work
from the mouthpiece of a
telephone set.

This. tampering with the
telephone spurred the phone
company to set up the re-
cording device.

The recordings required a
theme song about Davidson.
which Davidson does not
have. The alma mater was
too slow and the Wind En-
semble’s rendition of ‘Strike
Up the Band" was considered
inappropriate. So the noise
of the elevator was used.

Incorporating college news

Pipe Smoker

(Faculty and Students)

gathered by Lawrimore and
students, the Davidson Col-
lege News Bureau has been
able to expand its five min-
utes of news coverage into a
half hour time slot on WBT
radio every Sunday afternoon
from 3:30 to 4 p.m.

Council

2 Reports

In two meetings. this week.
the Student. Council received
a verbal report on the stu-
dent exchange trip to Haver-
ford Tuesday night from ex-
change chairman Joe Kilpa-
trick and considered meas.
ures Monday to assure adop-
tion of the new constitution.

“Councit President Tom
Earnhardt reported briefly on
the work of the student com.

. mittee appointed to advise

the trustee committee which
will nominate a new presi-
dent.

Earnhardt encouraged stu-
dents to recommend candi-
dates to the trustees. and
promised that all would re-
ceive “full and careful" con-
sideration.

Asked about trustee by-law
requiring the president to be
Presbyterian, Earnhardt said
that the trustee committee
would give any recommen.
dation equal consideration.

The regulations must be in

“The preamble.’’ said Car-

“We are trying to get

Box A, Dept. SCP-62
Randolph Air Force Base, Texas 76148

Now, that’s a pretty funny thing for a
civilian firm to say. A boss? Right out of !
college? The first day? !

But the Air Force can make such offers.

As an officer in the world’s largest
technological organization you're a
leader. Engineer.Scientist. Administrator.
Right where the Space Age break-
throughs are happening.

Or how about the executive respon-
sibility of a test pilot clocking 2,062 mph
in a YF-12A jet?

That could be you, too.

But you don’t have to be a pilot in the
Air Force to move fast. With your college
degree you zip into Officer Training
School, spin out an officer, speed on
your way as an executive, in the fore-

| front of modern science and technology.
Right on the ground.

The Air Force moves pretty fast.

Think it over. A man’s career can
sometimes move pretty slow.

MORNINGS AT SEVEN...AND |
THERE’S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.
ABOUT IT

Any man who says morning is the best time of day is
either a liar or a meadow lark.

There is only one way to make morning enjoyable:
sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is to
make morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is
possible if you will follow three simple rules:

1. Shave properly.

By shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don’t use
a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time
of clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor
angs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no
squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on
your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna
Super Stainless Stee! Blades.

I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive
until one considera that I am 49 years old) and I am here
to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not
only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir-
tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per-
sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna
does not rasp and tug, yelling, “Hey, lookit me!” No, sir,
not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per-
sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It
shucks your soil and stubble without toil and_ trouble.
Why, you hardly know it’s there, this well-bred Personna
blade, this paragon of punctilio.

Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker’s art, this
epitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Double-
edge atyle and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get
some.

2. Breakfast properly.

I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible
shaves, But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brac-
ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the
hideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an
ample breakfast.

Take, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph-
omore at V.M.' Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec-
tion by the Coszmandant one morning, prepared by stor-
ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would
not sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of
eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,
a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a
thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.

The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When
the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that
he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He
was, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today,
a perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander
in Cleveland.

3. Read properly.

Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting.
But do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acid-
making news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper—
the Home and Garden section, for example.

For instance, in my local paper, The Westport Peasant,
there is a delightful column called “Ask Ha Home-
spun” which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and
many an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and

answers:
Q: I am thinking of buying some power tools. What
should I get firat?

A: Hospitalization.

¢: How do you get rid of moles?

Q

rd

: Pave the lawn.
: What is the best way to put a wide car in a narrow
garage?

A: Butter it.

' Q: What do you do for elm blight?
A: Sait water gargie and bed rest.
Q: What can I do for dry hair?

A: Get a wet hat.

Shave, regular or menthol. Together, Personna and
Burma-Shave make a considerable contribution toward
forenoon survival.
