A few
final

words

By Matt Pirzer_
Sports Editor

You all are probably sick and
tired of columns such as the one
I’m about to write. But endure
with me for a just a few minutes.
Yes, I know it’s getting on toward
the end of January, making this
article a little dated.

ACCORDING TO

SCHOON

However, I feel compelled to
share some observations and in-
sights about the last year before I
shuttle on out of here (if any of you
care, I’1l be out of your hair after
this issue).

First of all, congratulations are
in order once again for the men’s
and women’s soccer teams and the
field hockey squad. Few teams are
lucky enough to win the last game
of their respective seasons. All of
you should be proud. Seniors,
doubly so.

Let’s all welcome Jim
Murphy, when our new athletic
director moves into his nice, plush
office down in Baker on Feb. 1.
Mr. Murphy, you have a tough job
here. Maintaining athletics at its
current level at the smallest coedu-
cational Division I school will not
be an easy task.

And here’s one recommenda-

. tions you’ re probably not seeking.
Put to rest all this talk about drop-
ping from D-I forthe final time. At
the risk of angering and offending
some otherwise decent people,
those of you who advocate Divi-
sion III athletics are, in a word,
misguided.

When else have you seen a
campus come together as it did

- During its first two seasons
as members of.the Southern Con-
ference, the Davidson women’s
basketball team compiled a 9-43
overall record, including an 0-26
conference mark.

WOMEN’S

BASKETBALL

Now in its third year, the re-
vitalized squad stands at 8-6, but
even withthe improvement, a Jan.
4 loss at Furman, after holding a
13-point halftime advantage, ex-
tended conference futility to 27
consecutive contests.

Point guards Monica Winter
and Elizabeth DuBose each said
in this year’s media guide that
their greatest momenton the court
would be winning their first South-
ern Conference game.

After the Cats trounced West-
ern Carolina on Jan. 13, 63-44,
finally earning that victory, both
Winter and DuBose can now aim
for bigger and better aspirations.

“It’s been a long time com-
jing. All the struggles were really
worth it. It was nice to do it that
convincingly, .. . to be able to do
it at home (and) to have the se-

Sophomore Jenny Vanlerberghe takes a free throw.

niors play such a nice role i in it,
too,” coach John Filar said.

With the score knotted at 17
with 7:34 left before intermission,
the Wildcats rattled off 17 unan-
swered points to claim a 34-17
lead at the half.

Inthe second frame, Davidson
picked up right where it left off, at
one point holding a 25-point ad-
vantage, as they coasted to the
memorable triumph.

Sophomore sharp-shooter Jen-
nifer Sanborn starred, tallying 18

points on 7-for-10 shooting from .

the field, including 3-for-4 from
three-point range.

Carolyn Kirsch, who averages
ateam-leading 13 points per game,
controlled the boards with a team-
best 11 rebounds.

Kristen Ferrucci returned from

‘aknee injury and scored six points

in abbreviated playing time.
The win was especially satis-

“fying, following a disappointing

1-2 performance over the break,
consisting not only of the 73-64
setback against Furman, but alsoa
59-54 away loss to Maryland-Bal-
timore County. Their lone vic-
tory was a lopsided 76-31 encoun-
ter against Army, in which five

_ Wildcats scored in double figures.

Jamie Brown led the way with 13
points and Montrella contributed
12, while Jennie Vanlerberghe and
gsie Young each scored 11.

Young shot a perfect 4-for-4 from

the field, 3-for-3 from long dis- -

tance, in her 13 minutes of action.
Kirsch recorded a double-double,
collecting 10 points and 11 re-
bounds. Danielle Mall also regis-
tered a 7-point, 7-rebound effort.
A 76-57 loss to powerful Ap-
palachian State (10-4, 3-0) in Belk
Arena Tuesday and an exciting 58-
57 win at Tennessee-Chattanooga

‘Saturday evening brought their

record to 8-6 (2-2 in the Southern).
And with 11 regular-season games
left, the Wildcats have a chance at
being the winningest women’s
basketball team ever at Davidson.
The 1985-86 and the 1974-75 teams
each posted 10 wins.

The Wildcats clawed back
from a 26-20 halftime deficit. in
Chattanooga, Saturday, to claim
their second conference win, and
even their conference record.
Ferrucci led all scorers with 15

points, while Montrella tossed in
12 offthe bench, and Jamie Brown
added 10. Carolyn Kirsch chipped
in nine points and grabbed nine
rebounds, six of them offensive.

Their accomplishments so
far this season are even more im-
pressive, when injuries are con-
sidered. The Brown twins, Jamie
and Kerry, have each endured
stress fractures, while Ferrucci,
who shoots 70 percent from the
floor and averages close to 13
points a game, missed six games
due to her knee injury. °

And Filar hopes the Wild-
cats, once healthy, can finish as a
top four team in the conference
and host a first round postseason
tournament game.

“By February (when every-
one is healthy), if there’s a team
on the rise, it’s going to be us,” he
said. “All the weapons will be
back in February.”

Cold water paddling is a must for winter

Outdoors enthusiasts should not miss this chilling opportunity

By JOHN ROE
Staff Writer .

Although the winter season is
in full swing, there are still many
outdoor activities to be enjoyed.
There are the obvious winter pas-
times, such as cross country and
donwhill skiing, ice fishing, and

OUTDOORS

hunting. Some even enjoy braving
the cold weather with a backpack
onthe trail, for the mountains take
ona spectacular appearance aftera
winter storm.

Although it is a rather com-

mon occurrence to see someone
walking into the woods with a rifle
or heading to the slopes with a set
of skis this time of year, one might
be puzzled upon seeing a back-
packer embarking on a trail with
snow, ice and other winter sur-
prises in the forecast.

But what if you were to run
across a group of kayakers in the
winter season? At first, you would
probably believe it was already
summer by some mistake, but soon
you would notice that it was still

snowing. Next you would want to .

ask questions such as: “Kayaking
is awarm weather activity, right?”
or “Isn’t the water freezing?” or
“Are you crazy?” These are all
common questions asked when one
happens upon a gang of paddlers in

the dead of winter, but believe it or
not,. some diehards believe

kayaking is just as legitimate a —

winter sport as skiing.

Although the weather is not
forgiving, there are many advan-
tages to paddling at this time of
year. First, if all you can remember
about your summer paddling trip
is dodging rafts and getting bumped
out of eddies by other boaters, try
paddling this winter. Although you
might have to duck to avoid icicles
or pass up the eddy that is now
solid ice, you will not need to com-

_ pete with the multitudes of people

and boats.

Also, because winter can bring
high waters to mountainous areas,
many outstanding creeks can be
run at optimum water levels. Be-

cause most of the water in runable
creeks andrivers comes from freez-
ing rain and snowmelt, don’t ex-

pect the water temperature to be.

forgiving or refreshing during a
swim. But, you can justify all of
that fancy gear you bought like
those high tech offshore Alpine
Mitts.

In order to paddle in inclimate
weather, you must be very confi-
dent and comfortable on the water.
Any wrong move or missed roll

can result in a bad situation that.
can only get worse. With the cold |

temperatures, hypothermia and
frostbite are very real possibilities,
so proper cold weather paddling
gear, plenty of food and water, and
very careful, knowledgeable pad-
dlers are essential for any witner

_paddling excursion.

I enjoyed my first winter on
the Obed-Emory watershed. Idon’t
know if it was the magnificent
canyon walls covered with ice, the
traces of being the only ones on the
water, but there was something
spectuacular about that canyon in
the winter. Maybe this feeling was
brought on by the anticipation of
venturing into the canyon in dan-
gerous weather, or maybe it was
just a good cure for a bad case of
cabin fever. _

Try paddling a creek or river
this winter, and experience the cold
season in an unconventional man-
ner. You might just realize that
winter paddling is not crazy, but a
great way to experience the out-
doors this time of year.
