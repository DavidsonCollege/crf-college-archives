of the course, Clem will return to Southern Bell and the
increased responsibilities that await him there.

Clem Patton, like many young engineers, is impatient
to make things happen for his company and himself: There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
