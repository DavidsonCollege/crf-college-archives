A Momentous Decision

Mr. David Stitt
Editor
Davidsonian

Davidson, North Carolina

Dear David:

Al the recent meeting of the Trustees the fol-
lowing motion was made and unanimously ap-
proved: ‘‘that the Editors of the Davidsonian be
requested to remove from the masthead of that
paper the words, ‘the news and editorial volce
of Davidson College’ and that appropriate words
in substitution thereof be worked out between the
staff of the Davidsonian and the Administration

of the College.’

We were, needless to say. highly
flattered to learn that the Board of
Trustees took time from their delib-
erations two weeks ago to vote unani-
mously to have part of our masthead
removed.

“The News and Editorial Voice of
Davidson College’ has meant to us
merely that this newspaper contains
the “news” (which it does), “and edi-
torial voice” (meaning “voice of the
editor,” obviously of the editor of this
publication), “of Davidson College.”

The trustees, however, apparently
felt (unanimously) that the masthead

Headache Powder

This week we have seen evidenced
an attitude we do not entirely under-
stand. We’ve caught criticism from
two sources (same general direction)
for broadcasting via a back-page head-
line the fact that another atheist was
coming on campus this week.

Concern was expressed by both men
over the “adverse publicity” the col-
lege has received because of the con-
troversial speakers issue, and we were
chastised for having added to the “un-
necessary headaches” of the adminis-
trators involved.

The “unnecessary headaches” no
doubt conisist of criticism of the calibre
evidenced in force in the Charlotte
newspapers immediately after atheist
Michael Scriven’s brief visit here.

The headache we understand, but
the consternation over publicizing the
speakers we do not understand. The
administration of this-college answers
to no one except the Board of
Trustees, and two weeks ago the
Board voted unanimously to back the
administration's policy on inviting
speakers here.

With the only opinion that really
matters officially on record as favor-

implied that we were purporting to

This week we're running without
anything in the masthead, awaiting
approval of our request for permission
to use “The News and Editorial Voice

ed to speak for the entire college com-

able toward an open-platform policy,
why the consternation over criticism
from the Outside?

Criticism is, to say the least, inevita-
ble for any good academic institution
in this section of the country. Again,
inevitable, and we cannot see incoher-
ent, fanatical attacks by fundamental-
ists perturbing a college administra-
ion.

Actually, we believe this type of
criticism to be a healthy sign that
Davidson College is performing its
mission as an academic institution. If
the college were not offending funda-
mentalist and other backward ele-
ments, Davidson would have absolute-
ly no claim to the title of an institu-
tion of higher learning.

“Unnecessary” headaches? If head-
aches are what it takes to establish an
atmosphere conducive to genuine
academic pursuit at Davidson, then
those headaches are necessary.
Even if it means telling a lot of people
to take a powder because this school
is committed to an  open-platform
policy on speakers.

Anesthesia Machine In Laos,
MEDICO Thanks Students

Dear Donors:

Not long ago I visited Lom-
phat, Cambodia, where I had the
pleasure of helping to uncrate
an anesthesia machine, complete
with the spare parts. The natives
and doctors who work in this re-
mote place were visibly impress-
ed. Before this they have had to
use antiquiated methods in
anesthesia. ;

In order to get this machine
to Lomphat, it was necessary
first to bring it over the Pacific,
up the Saigon River to Saigon,

then up the Mekong River to
Phnom Penh from Phnom Penh
the crate was then put on anoth-
er small river steamer, sent to
Kratie. From there again, it
changed two more times: before
finally arriving in this small
village. This hospital is the only
one in the radius of more than
100 miles and serves many
Laotians,. Montagnards (hill
tribe men from the mountains)
and Cambodians.

T am sorry that you could not
have been there to see the looks

on the faces of the MEDICO
personne) and I am sorry that
you also could not be there to
realize the tremendous use this
machine will have..It was only
through you, the generous donors
from Davidson College that these
people will be able to realize the
more modern practice of medi-
cine.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Y Has No Official Role
In Civil Rights Walk

Davidson

Dear Editor:

There has been some confu.
sion about: the relationship be-
tween the YMCA. and the Char-
lotte March. At the last Cabinet
meeting this matter was discuss-
ed, and I was appointed to
write a letter stating the official
position of the Cabinet.

1. The “Y” is not sponsoring
the March.

2. The “Y" recognizes the
March as a legitimate means of
expression. Several members
are participating in this demon-
stration, and several are not.

3. The choice — whether to
march or not—is a personal
matter and should be recog-
nized as such without any per-
sonal or collective recrimina-
tion.

STEVE DAVIDSON,
Vice President YMCA

Campbell

Dear Editor:

The infringements on liberty
and personal freedom in private
affairs contained in the civil
rights legislation which’ will
come before the Senate in the
next few weeks are questioned
and opposed by many intelligent
people in both the North and. the

South,

The Davidson Civil Rights
Committee, a very active and
serious minded group. is pushing
this legislation by letters to
Washington, petitions, and pro-
posed freedom marches. Many
people feel obligated by their be-
lief in civil rights to endorse the
pending legislation just because
it is pro-civil rights, without
considering the effect that the
precedent set by this legislation
could have on the way of life
(fading thought it may be) that
we now enjoy. The power of the
government to meddle in our
private affairs would be greatly
extended by the bill as it now
stands.

Before giving evidence of
support of this legislation, one
should investigate just what
he is supporting. Civil rights
may be a worthy cause, but it
does not follow that all meth-
ods used to bring it about are
good or necessary. Just as
opposition to prohibition did
not mean that one was a
drunkard, opposition to this
civil rights legistation does not
mean that one is a racist.

Also the fact that the bill may
be compromised is not a just
reason to support it as it is now.
It just may not be changed. We
owe it to our future to look at
both, sides of the question be-
fore we manifest our support of
the bill.

Ferris

Dear Editor:

This year four of our outstand-

ing professors, Dr. Tilly, Dr.
Tucker, Dr. MacCormac, and
Prof, Gross, will be leaving Da-
vidson. It is possible that none
of these men will return to teach
at Davidson again. Their loss is
upsetting because it represents
a continuation of a pattern
among our professors which has

‘been developing for a number of

years.

Each year my class has been
at Davidson a number of our
younger professors have left the
school. Some were forced to
leave because the school refused
to renew its contract with them;
others left by choice. Let. us re-
fresh our memories with the
names of a few of these men:
Dr. Lord, Dr. Goodykoontz,
Prof. Holland, Prof, Stroud, Dr.
Tracas, Dr. Bevan, Dr. Staples,
Dr. Labanov, Mr. Horton, Prof.
Miller and Prof. Evans. (Al-
though Mr. Horton and Dr. Sta-
ples were not. professors, the cir-
cumstances leading up to their
departure were similar to those
of the professors listed. Dr. La-
banov's record as a scholar in
Russian history and his incred-
ible knowledge of religion, mu:
sic, literature and languages
made his loss a tragedy in spite
of his age.)

Unfortunately these men were
among the finest professors in

our eyes as students. We ad-
mired them for their youth ‘and
for their probing, critical minds.
It is inevitable that we had more
in common with these: profsss-
ors. They were closer to our
generation and could understand
the problems we face as stu-
dents. Also their vitality made
classroom discussions more in-
teresting. Their excitement for
courses was transmitted to stu-
dents.

‘It was inevitable that these
men would voice criticisms of
our system of education. They
were thinking individuals who
wanted to see Davidson improve
her educational system. Unfor-
tunately, many were allowed to
leave because of such criticism.

Davidson is developing a pat-
tern of conformity among its
professors which raises a seri-
ous question. The question is
whether we at Davidson wish to
sacrifice the quality of our pro-
fessors in order 40 maintain our
present systems of thought. By
adapting such a policy we en-,
danger the quest for truth which
every good college seeks to in-
still in its students and profess-
ors.

Conflict is the key to a good
education. Only by exposing our

ihe

convictions in Mill's ‘‘Market-
place of Ideas’ can we profess
them with integrity. Such con-
flict can also teach us to be
more tolerant of those who hold
different opinions with equal
conviction.

This letter is a plea for toler-
ance in dealing with professors
like those who are leaving now
and have left in the past. We
need these men.

AN_URCHIN’S WAY

Tutor Program Underway
With Local Negro Students

BY DUNCAN D. NEWCOMER

Nineteen Negro high school students from the town
of Davidson sauntered and shuffled onto the college
campus last Monday night. Like us they wanted to im.
prove their education. Like us they came in all sizes and
styles. Like us they vary in talents.

Out of the YMCA’s first tutorial program came a
bundle of rich inter-personal relationships. Ask any tutor.
Out of one particular session, Jay Federman’s, came the
following essay. Considering that most of these high
school students are still learning that “capacity” can
mean more than “how many people a bus will hold,” this
essay is even more startling.

Its author is Guy Connor, 15. His dad and brother
work in our laundry. We print this from the other side
of the tracks to inspire him, and them, and us.

Griffift St.: The street I live on.

Griffift Street, does this sound like any other street
you've ever heard of? Well if it does it’s a big mistake
because it is a street of many wonders. It is a wide, plain
blacktop road, on which something is happening every
minute of the day and most of the night. On each and
every side there are homes which though very small,
hold a different story of its own. So its much like a circus
where many different things are going on at once and who
know what the next step on the midway will bring.

My Best Friend

My best friend is a likeable, humorous character
named, Charles McCain. He’s not only my friend but the
friend of most of the boys in my community. He can
always turn a seemingly hopeless situation into one with
unlimited possibilities with a timely joke or with one of
his homemade, spur of the moment “maxims.” He's funny
but he can be as serious as the sphinx or as intent as a
Caesar wooing his Cleopatra.

Another essay—by an eighth grader, John Pat-
terson—reflects a view of our town which he also

calls his town.

Davidson

The most part of Davidson I like are the stores and
the fire department. in the stores yu find what you need,

like fruits, candy, cookies, canne

things.

foods and many other

At the fire department, I like to look at the fire
trucks when they are at the Town Hall.

Another place I like is the post office. I like to go in
an get the mail out of the box and get warm in the post

office.

DCRC Fosters Equality
For Charolotte Marchers

BY CALVIN ZON

Last October, a group of Davidson students, members of the faculty and towns. |
people formed the Davidson Civil Rights Committee, whose purpose, as stated in its
constitution, is “to improve human relations and conditions in the Davidson communi-
ty, and to eliminate racial prejudice and discrimination here and elsewhere.”

Our chairman, Mrs. Mary
Johnson, a housewife and life-
long resident of Davidson, re-
marked that the committee has
provided the first opportunity in
Davidson for meaningful com-
munication between whites and
Negroes. In the past, many
things were done for Negroes but
never really with them. It is our
hope that a patronizing, conde-
scending relationship is giving
way to a spirit of cooperation
and community.

Most of the work of DCRC is
carried on by five committees,
and each member § generally
serves on a committee, Our Ec-
onomic Opportunities Commit-
tee, chaired by Dr. E. F. Pat-
terson, is attempting to find job
openings for local Negroes. It is
initiating a comprehensive sur-
vey of opportunities connected
with the college, and local busi-
nesses and factories.

Our Integration at Davidson
Committee is headed by Paxton
Wray. This committee is work-
ing closely with the Admissions
Office .in trying to enroll quaii-
fied American Negroes. To this
end, students have visited ‘‘Ne-
gro” high schools and have
hosted prospective Negro stu-
dent while on campus. It is look-
ing into problems of campus life
faced by Negro students.

Bill Ferris heads our Relig-
ious, Cultural and Social Com-
mittee, which is concerned with
creating greater contact and
communication within the com-
munity. It has sought to break

down de facto segregation in Da-
vidson's eight churches which
are divided largely according to
race and class although there is
no formal policy of ‘segregation.
Last Sunday, a number of Da-
vidson students went to ‘“Ne-
gro’ Sunday schools and then
accompanied Negro students to
services at local ‘white’
churches.

Last December, the com-
mittee secured a promise from
President D. Grier Martin that
“no ‘punitive action will be tak-
en against any employee of
Davidson College because of
his membership on, or assocla-
tlon with, the Committee. This
would not exclude acfion
which might be Indicated be-
cause of other reasons, includ-
ing failure to carry out duties
and responsibilities or viola-
tlons of the regulations of the
college the town, the state,
or the nation.”

The committee learned that
many natural leaders of the Ne.
gro community such as minis-
ters and teachers do not live in
Davidson because of inadequate
housing and school facilities.
There has been cooperation with
the Mayor's Committee in work-
ing out the desegregation of pub-
lic facilities in town.

Our Voter Education and Reg-
istration Committee, led by Mrs.
William Morris, seeks to en-
courage Negroes to exercise the
right to vote. It is attempting to
find the causes of widespread
non-voting and to alleviate the

problem by providing the neces-
sary education and information.

Our Intercollegiate Communi-
cation Committee, headed by
Tom Vinson, seeks to promote
contact between Davidson and
‘Negro’ colleges. Its plans for
the future. include greater par-
ticipation in Davidson cultural
activities by Negro students, and
weekend exchanges through
which Davidson students could
live at a ‘‘Negro" college and
Négro students could live at Da-
vidson. It also strives to encour-
age civil rights activities at oth
er colleges.

As a result of our recent letter’
writing campaign for the civil
rights bill, over 40 letters were
written by Davidson students
and professors, and at least 40
were written by local Negroes.

The Committee is currently
sponsoring the march to Char-
lotte on behalf of civil rights leg-
islation. Many members of DC-
RC are participating in the YM-
CA tutorial project.

We do not claim to have found
any foolproof answers to any-
thing. For all of us this has been
a learning experience. We think
that our group affords us 4
unique opportunity to learn
about and contribute to the com-
munity in which we spend four
years of our lives. The experi-
ence gained will be useful in our
home communities or wherever
we decide to live. We invite the
help and support of all those in-
terested.
