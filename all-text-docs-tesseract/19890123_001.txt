Suspect allegedly stole stereos from cars on campus

By DELIA JOHNSON

Charges are pending against David
Francis Maillie, 17, of Huntersville, for
larceny as aresult of a dramatic foot and car
chase that began on the Davidson College
campus.

According to police reports, at about 10
p.m. January 7, Maillie was discovered
parked behind the football field in a yellow
pickup truck.

As .Officer Emory McLaurin of the
Davidson College Police Department ap-
proached the truck, the suspect drove off.
McLaurin followed and began the chase
when the truck did not pull over when
McLaurin flashed his blue lights.

McLaurin pursued the truck into Cor-
nelius and tried to stop it by hitting it when
it stopped suddenly in front of Cashion’s
Food Mart. ;

The chase*continued onto Highway 73.
Maillie allegedly threw two car radios out
of the passenger window of his truck. He
then turned off onto Old Beatty Ford Road
and stopped the truck on Belle Isle Drive,

“where it was hit again by the patrol car.

Maillie then allegedly jumped out of the

truck and ran into the woods with college

and Cornelius police officers in pursuit.
Five to ten minutes later, McLaurin re-
ported that a car came down the road, the
suspect got out and was arrested for the
traffic violations.

College police expect to add more
charges to the traf-

ers on campus. Both Cornelius and sur-
rounding towns are growing, says Hughes,
and “we are getting the overflow.”

He encourages students to lock their
cars, make sure they check their cars every

the paperwork is

completed.
Maillie told
McLaurin that the

five radios, two
depth finders and
20 to 25 cassettes
in the back of the
pickup truck were
stolen, but had
been put there by a
friend.

- Summers praised King “as a
scholar, not a politician” who
sacrificed a secure career for his
struggle in civil rights during the
1960s. “He was a drum major for
justice,” said Summers, “but he
must have died a thousand times.”

Summers discussed King’s
uneasiness with the southern
white liberal clergymen who re-
quested him to “slow down” and
“be patient” with his civil rights
movement.

“Martin Luther King, Jr. said
now is the time for civil rights and
direct confrontation,” Summers
said. “Time does not cure social
ills. The time is always right for
doing right.”

Following Summers’ sermon,
seven gospel choirs from the area
performed songs that hailed King.

Senior Melissa Givens emoriced

the choirs.

“These gospel songs are bach of
the same spirit that catapulted Dr.
King into the forefront of his-
tory,” she said. “They are based

on faith and grounded in belief in
a better life for all.” The program
was filled with frequent hand-
clapping and foot-tapping.

“The primary purpose, besides
honoring Dr. King,” said Brenda
Tapia, Davidson’s acting chap-
lain, “is to provide an opportunity
to bring town and gown together.
Many black employees working
here are members of these sur-
rounding congregations.”

Attendance has increased in the
last three years, especially from
the Charlotte area, and this year’s
gospel festival was attended by
blacks and whites, young and old.
However, Tapia was “very disap-
pointed” with the non-blacks of
the Davidson College commu-
nity. She had hoped that more
college community members
would have taken time to show
interest.

The event was sponsored
jointly by the Chaplain’s Office,
the Black Student Coalition and

- the Chapel Committee.
