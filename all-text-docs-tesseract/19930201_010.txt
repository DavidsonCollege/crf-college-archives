THE DAVIDSONIAN

SPORTS

Freshman Wrestlers Excel at
Washington and Lee Tournament

By Robert Lloyd-Still

As the Davidson wrestlers
reached the midpoint of their sea-
son, the team continued to improve
and more importantly, gain valu-
ableexperience. Last weekend, the
‘Cats traveled to the Washington
& Lee Invitational, and they faced
stiff competition from host W&L
and teams including VMI, Wash-
ington and Jefferson and
Longwood.

The ‘Cats are young with
seven freshmen on the starting
lineup. They make up for their
inexperience, though, with effort
and determination. Coach Tom
Oddo described the team’s perfor-

mance in this manner: “We lost a
lot of matches by one or two points
which you learn to accept when
youare starting so many freshman.
It’s basically a lack of experience.”

Many of the younger wres-
tlers have stepped into leadership
roles for the ‘Cats. Oddo pointed
out the performances of Tom
Greene, Jared Glick and Jason
Deaton. Greene, a freshman, de-
feated the wrestler who had pinned
him a week earlier. Greene went 3-
1 for the weekend and lost to the
eventual champion in the semi-
finals. Glick wrestled a “strong,
physical match,” according to
Oddo, until an injury in the conso-

lation semi-finals forced him to
withdraw. Glick still managed a
fourth-place finish. In the 118
pound weight class, Deaton took
third place and lost in his final
match by one point.

Oddo summed up the team’s
progress so far by saying that “the
team’s attitude is fabulous. Every-
body is having a great time, enjoy-
ing the sport of wrestling. We are
serious about getting better. We
need some experience and the only
way we can get it is by paying
attention and wrestling.”

The ‘Cats’ next match is the
Mid South Toumey at Jefferson
City, Tennessee.

Men's Tennis Opens Spring Season

By Brannon Buck

This past weekend Davidson’s
tennis team began the quest for its
22nd straight winning season un-
der the guidance of coach Jeff
Frank. The Wildcats faced tough
competition ata tournamenthosted
by UNC-Chapel Hill which in-

delves further into its tough sched-
ule. Frank was pleased with the
doubles play, but noted that the
team was not as sharp in singles.
He also said there were no real
standouts at the tournament.
After going 8-0 in the fall, the
‘Cats will face an extremely tough

cluded teams from Wake Forest, schedule in the spring, complete

Purdue, and Campbell in addition
to the Wildcats and the Tar Heels.

Davidson’s performance pro-
vided some bright spots, but it also
proved that the team has a great
deal of work left to do before it

with a full slate of Southern.Con-
ference opponents as well as Vir-
ginia and South Carolina. But with
the entire singles line-up returning

ished second in the Big South)

Southern Conference
Celebrates 10 Years
of Women's Sports:

By Holt Hathaway

When do you think women
first attended Davidson College?
If you guessed the fall of 1973, you
are wrong. If you guessed the
1972, you are wrong. If you
guessed the 1970-1971 school year,
you are still wrong. But if you
guessed 1930, you are right.

Women first attended classes
at Davidson during the Great De-
pression. Atthetime, familiescould
not afford to send their daughters
to women’s colleges, so local
women were allowed to attend
classes at Davidson. These local
women were allowed only to at-
tend, and could not speak out in
class. Among them was Giddy
Dyer, who was later a sponsor of
the Equal Rights Amendment in
the Illinois state legislature. In a
Davidsonian article from January
14, 1983, Dyer commented that
since then her consciousness has
been raised, but at the time she felt
it was an honor to be permitted in
the classes.

Forty years later, Davidso:
participated in the Eight College
Exchange Program, a program set
up between Davidson and other
colleges to let their students expe-

| tience other college campuses.

Mary Baldwin, Queens, Randolph-
Macon, Hollins, and Sweet Briar
also participated in the program.
During the 1970-1971 school year

Selection of Stuart Scholars is based on qualities that
characterized Ed Stuart for whom the program is named:
Christian commitment, leadership potential, academic

achievement, and vigorous outlook.

Application materials and additional information may be
obtained from Ms. Brenda King, Chambers 111.

cholarships

ten women attended Davidson on
the Exchange Program. These fe-
male students were only attending
Davidson temporarily; they were
not allowed to receive degrees.

The following year twelve
women came to Davidson on the
program. These women partici-
pated in many campus activities,
including the formation of an all-
female, IMAC swim team (prob-
ably the very first women’s ath-
letic team).

In May of 1972, two years
after the Exchange Program was
started, the trustees of Davidson
College unanimously voted to ad-
mit women as degree-seeking stu-
dents. Davidson became officially
coed in the fall of 1972. Although
Davidson had aimed at admitting
100 female students, only twenty-
nine degree candidates attended in
1972-1973, most of whom were
transfers. Twenty-eight other fe-
male students also attended
Davidson through the Exchange
Program. In the fall of 1973, the
first full class of freshmen women
was admitted.

The rest of the story is about
growth. This year, the Southern
Conference is celebrating that
growth. 1992-93 marks the 10th
anniversary of women’s athletics
in the Southern Conference. Al-
