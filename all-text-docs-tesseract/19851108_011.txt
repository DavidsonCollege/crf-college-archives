Comments on American-Soviet summit

Bruce Sarkisian

In a little under two weeks, President Reagan will have
his first summit with a Soviet leader since he took office.
Over the past few months, the Soviet propaganda machine
has been expertly molding world opinion to think that
Reagan, with his “Star Wars” program, presents a serious
challenge to constructive negotiations, while Gorbachev,
the (relatively) young, charismatic leader of the Soviets, is
a benevolent peacemaker, fervently hoping to reduce the
threat of nuclear war in our time. Hopefully, most of us will
not fall into the trap of this honey-tongued rhetoric and
think our President a merciless war-monger. Rather, I hope
that this propaganda will make us more wary of the tricks
the Soviet government can play, and will make us go into
the summit with wider eyes and clearer minds.

Gorbachev is trying to over-stress arms control at the
summit, particularly the development of “Star Wars,” in
order to avert the world’s eyes from the “dirty little wars”

he is carrying on in countries in which the U.S.S.R. has no
business being involved. According to President Reagan’s
speech to the United Nations, at present, there are 118,000
Soviet troops in Afghanistan, 140,000 Soviet-supported
Vietnamese soldiers occupying Cambodia, Cuban troops
with Soviet advisors in Ethiopia and Angola and 8,000
Soviet and Cuban military personnel in Nicaragua. The
people of these countries are victims of Marxist-Leninist
ideology, which in itself is bad enough, but when imposed
against one’s will, it becomes all the more tyrannical.
When the Soviets began their expansionist policies into
Ethiopia and Angola during the mid 70s, they essentially
destroyed all the good relations that President Nixon helped
establish. It is now up to Reagan and Gorbachev to reestab-
lish some form of this detente. Admittedly, the U.S. has its
own “dirty little war” going on in Nicaragua as well, but
this is only to counteract the Soviet threat. I am hopeful that
the two countries can work out a plan where they both pull
out of Nicaragua; however, if we are going to pull out, we
must be sure that the Russians will too, and that they will
curb their expansionist policies elsewhere.

As far as arms control, the only reason the Soviets want
to see “Star Wars” scrapped is that they don’t have the tech-

nology to build it. So far, the only proposal that the Rus-
sians have made is that they will reduce their nuclear
weapons only if we drop “Star Wars.” The reason the
Soviets feel threatened by “Star Wars” is that they know it
will render most of their nuclear weapons useless. The
U.S. should not drop “Star Wars” and should not enter into
an arms treaty of any kind unless it is mutually verifiable.
As we have recently seen, the Soviets violated the SALT II
arms treaty with respect to nuclear testing, and we have to
learn not to take the Soviets on their word alone.

During the past few weeks, U.S. and Soviet officials
have been meeting to lay the ground work for the upcoming
summit. When asked by the press if there is any hope for
the summit, officials from both sides said there are “seeds”
and “nuggets” of hope. To quote George J. Church in Time
magazine of November 4, “The challenge of Geneva will
be to nourish, rather than trample upon, (these) seeds that,
by even the most optimistic reading, are exceedingly rare
and fragile.” I agree with this statement; I just hope that we
are not taken in by the crafty Soviet propagandists in the
process.
