Youth, Offense, Keep Wildcats In Southem Conference

By EDWIN PAGE

Hopes run high on the David-
son baseball diamond this spring
and the reason is simple. The 1985
version of the Wildcats baseball
team features an abundance of tal-
ent. In only his fourth year as head
coach, George Greer has put to-
gether a team that can legitimately
contend for the Southern Confer-
ence baseball crown. The core of
last year’s 12-16-1 team returns
nearly intact for the 85 campaign,
and several key freshman have
been added to the roster.

If the Cats have proven any-
thing thus far in the season, it is
that they can hit the ball. The new
scoreboard has been put to the test
as the Cats, and unfortunately
their opponents, have been cross-
ing the plate with regularity. The
Cats have also discovered the
homerun this year. Last year the
team hit 18 dingers in 29 games. A
five homerun bonanza against
Citadel last Sunday and four more
against Wingate on Tuesday gave
the Cats 24 in only 15 games.

There are two simple reasons
for the sudden power surge—Alan
Lewis and Bill Masse. These two
freshmen have cracked the start-
ing line-up and made their pre-
sence felt this year with 7 and 6
homers respectively to lead the

team. Sophomore Dave Turgeon
is pulling his weight in the line-
up, hitting the ball at over a .400
pace and freshman Terry Rupp
has been red-hot since joining the
squad after spring break. Add last
year’s top hitter junior Keith Hel-
fant, the steady bats of juniors
Tim Waters and Scott Weaver,
and solid sophomores Dan
Simonds and Dave Depaul, and it
Is easy to see why the team is so
potent offensively this year.

The pitching is, according to
Greer, “good enough for us to
make the playoffs. Weaver, last
year’s top pitcher, has a 3-1 record
and has established himself as the
top starter. Freshman David
Fitzgerald (2-1) has been impres-
sive despite joining the team right
after basketball season. Sopho-
more Steve Condon looks promis-
ing as the third starter, but has
been inconsistent thus far. Sopho-
more Billy Waitsman will likely
fill the fourth starter slot. The staff
is much deeper than last year’s
which should aid the Cats down
the stretch in their drive to make
the playoffs.

Although opponents have
scored a lot of runs this season,
Greer feels the pitching is not to-
tally to blame. “We have made
some key errors and then com-

Netters Are Kept Busy

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson's young men’s ten-
nis team has undergone a type of
baptism by fire. By Friday the sea-
son will be half over in terms of
matches played to matches yet to
be played. Needless to say, these
guys have been playing a lot of
tennis the last three weeks.

“A lot of schedule consists of
teams coming south during spring
break.” said coach Jeff Frank.
“The problem with playing so
much tennis in so little time is that
we don’t have much practice time
to correct problems that develop.
This lack of practice hurts the
freshmen especially since the up-
perclassmen adjust better.”

Any problems for the
freshmen mean problems for the
team. Half of the six singles posi-
tions belong to freshmen. Jim
Thompson, Bill Young, and Ric
Hodge are the third, fourth, and
fifth singles players, respectively.
All have played well considering

Wildcats Fall ‘To Marshall, Finish

By PERRY MATHRWES

At the beyinning of spring
break, while most students headed
to the beach or ski resorts, the bas-
ketball team went to Asheville to
play in the Southern Conference
Tournament. Seeded seventh,
Davidson fell 83-71 to a tough
Marshall squad, who finished the
regular season with an 18-12 re-
cord overall and second place in
the conference, with a 12-4 °2-
cord Davidson finished the year
with a 10-20 record

the tremendous effort they have
been asked to put forth.

“Freshmen aren‘t expected to
succeed immediately.” said
Frank, “but these guys
(Thompson, Young, and Hodge)
have done well so far. By the end
of the season I feel they will all be
in top form.”

As of Tuesday. Davidson 1s 9-
5, a superior record considering
the schedule has teams such as
North Carolina, Penn State, and
West Virginia. Penn State and
West Virginia both had to come
from behind to nip Davidson 5-4.
Davidson's biggest win came over
defending NATA champion Atlan-
tic Christian at 6-3.

“Our singles play has been
strong,” said Frank. “We've had
trouble getting proper team work
in doubles. As people get used to
playing together, our doubles play
should once again become the
strongest part of our team.”

The leaders in singles play

The game started on an upbeat
note for Davidson, as junior Ken
Niebuhr scored the first points of
the game. Marshall quickly re-
taliated and as Davidson brought
the ball downcourt, Robert Eppes
stole the ball and scored to give
Marshall the lead. This play set
the tone of the game.

By the end of the game,
Davidson had committed 29 tur-
novers and Marshall gave the ball
away 21 times. Marshall slowly
pulled away as Davidson, led by
sophomore Chris Heineman’s 10

pounded them with bad pitches.
We have to play consistent de-
fense to win.”

The Cats are once again a very

~ young team. No seniors appear on

the roster, and only four juniors
are on the team. This puts a lot of
responsibility on the shoulders of
the freshmen and sophomores to
carry the load. The team’s youth
may have something to do with
the 7-8 record so far as the Cats
have dropped some winnable
games. The team has also played a
very busy schedule with one string
of eight games in eight days, al-
lowing the pitching staff little time
to rest. Look for the Cats to im-
prove as they move into the more
sparsely populated area of their
schedule and have a more rested
pitching staff to work with.

Last weekend, the Cats
dropped both games of a double-
header to The Citadel on Saturday
4-1 and 11-9. Sunday, however,
they rebounded to dill the visitors
16-1. Weaver pitched a strong
game and helped his own cause by
homering. Masse, however, was
the hitting star with two roundtrip-
pers. On Tuesday the Cats rolled

_ over Wingate 25-7. Weaver and

Masse each homered and Lewis
matched Masse’s Sunday heroics
by blasting two out and driving in

six runs. Waitsman collected the
win.

The team travels to Furman
for a very important series this
weekend and next week they face
