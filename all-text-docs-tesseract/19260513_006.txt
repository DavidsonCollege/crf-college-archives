THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 13, 1926

Debating Season Closes
With Defeat at Sewanee,

Freshmen Complete Their Program
With Meet at Carolina

The Davidson Debating team has ended
its season after having filled a profitable and}
interesting schedule.

Four debates were held during the year
and although the Wildcats won but one of
these, two were 'lost by one vote.- Several
new men were uncovered who have a real
talent along forensic lines and prospects are
bright for next year’s team, althovzh the
Wildcats will probably attempt an even more
ambitious schedule than ever before. As
was the policy this year, the Forensic Coun-
cil will try to schedule inter-sectional de-
bates rather than with teams in the state.

The first debate of the season was against
the University of Pittsburgh, who defeated
the local team composed of Parks, Ratchford
and Powell by a 4-1 vote. The V. P. I.
team nosed out a 2-1 victory over Williams
and Bowie. The Wildcats gained their only
victory against P. C. by a 4-1 vote, Pullen,
Stuart and T. G. McCutcheon representing

where Wharton and Branch got the small
end of a 2-1 vote. This debate was consid-
ered one of the closest ever held at the Uni-
versity of the South.

bate with the University of North Carolina,
May the 18th. Pritchett, Gates and Kell
will go to Chapel Hill, while Graham, Grady |

1921-22 were installed in a beautiful out-

students gathered around the old well by |
the side of Phi Hall, and just as the sun |

Prof. Wachter Host to
Four Junior Speakers —
Friday in Statesville

Branch, Steward, Williams and Mc-
Cutcheon Are Guests

Thursday night; May 5th, Professor
Wachter gave a banquet at the Vance Hotel,

‘in Statesville, to the Junior Speakers. Those

present were Harllee Branch, Don Stewart, |
Clancy Williams and L. M. McCutcheon.
These Jyniors have worked hard on their |
orations and deserve to be praised. The
diners had a room all to themselves, and,

| although several of them had reviews the

next morning, they talked and discussed
everything in general until about 10 o'clock.
They had a fine time, and the banquet proved
a great success. Fi

This is not the first time that Professor |
Wachter has “done something” for the sti1-
dents and for the college. “He has backed
and stood behind the athletic teams all year, |
and has added a great deal to the Davidson
spirit. During the football season he did)
more:than any other one man to put pep |
into the students and into the team. He has
given banquets to other groups of students
on other similar occasions, and these have
always proved successful.

Professor Wachter does not intend to re- |
turn next year, and the students realize that |
they are losing a valuable friend and advisor. |
He has been here almost two years, and he|
has done much for. Davidson during that
time. r

amendment a threatening menace to Amer- |
ican society, and in whiskey a demoralizing |
demon of no small proportions. Whiskey
was pictured as the cause of the recent
crime wave, as a injurious stimulant, an un-|
Christian commodity, and a pernicious evil
among laborers and.collegians alike.
hibition, to them, has been a God-send. It
has closed saloons, which in pre-Volstead |
days were centers of bad influences, and the
home of crime; it has destroyed what for-
merly seemed a—curse to society; and al-|
though it has by no means etitirely stopped |
the manufacture and sale of liquor, it has |
had its good effects. ‘Give it a trial for at

| least two generations,” demand the prohibi- |

tion advocates at Davidson. “It is unfair to |
expect a man-made law to relieve in one or
two years all the evil that men for g@nera-|
tions of intemperance have brought upon,
themselves. But, remémber,” they go on to}
remark, “that public drunkenness and de-
baunchery are by no means as prevalent now

jas they were in pre-prohibition days.” But,
| they don’t stop there in their praise for the
| Volstead law.

They remind their fellows,
that prohibition has saved homes, and has
bettered the welfare of the whole society.
The “wets” come back with a vehement
attack on the Volstead amendment. It has
not only failed to relieve drunkenness, they
observe, but it has made drunkenness worse.
It has taken liquor from the laborer and
given it to the collegian, with disgusting
effects in each instance. It has destroyed the
open saloon, it has created the bootlegger ; it
has taken away governmental inspection of |
liquors and given to the public a brand of
whiskey that will be inevitably bought, even
though it be poisonous in its very ingredients.
It has made a sport of what was in pre-|

| prohibition days a recognized debauchery,
, and has attracted youth to the use of a dam-

aging beverage. It has taken from the gov-
ernment a vital source of revenue, and has

very fundamentals. It has déstroyed ‘the in-

ent rights of American citizenry, and has
failed to do any of the things its advocates
predicted for it. And there you have the
contention of the “wets.”

At Davidson prohibition has a vast major-
ity behind it, but the fight seems sure to
continue, Just what the “drys” claim as an
accomplishment for the eighteenth amend-
ment, the “wets” use as an argument against
it—there seems no hope of peace. And so it|
must go on ad infinitum, unless some kind
Providence destroys the prospects of a big
corn and rye crop, and thus destroys the in-
gredients so necessary to the manufacture
of this trouble. Let us pray for a famine in
these grains!
