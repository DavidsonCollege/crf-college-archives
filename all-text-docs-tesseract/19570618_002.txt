T SUMMER ~ AH, LAST Subang |

“Ihe 1956 session of SUMMER SCHOOL at
Davidson offered many varied opportunities
for recreation on campus, as many of you
“old timers" may well remember, Seems
like there was something to do every day
to-make life more interesting.

Is j% all coming back to you?

Last summer, our campus was graced
with the novw-infamous International Re-
lations Seminar, Davidson College put
on the cloak of Peace and Friendship
while the town's disgruntled. citizenry
had logical (?) reasons for burning
crosses, for throwing water in the
vicinity of Duke Dormitory, and for
firing across the muddy Catawba with a
shotgun at the colorful members of the
Seminars

This summer, no Seminar.

Last summer, dear old Georgia Dorm
was being dismantled and carted away. We
could watch with awe as the powerful
craie swung an iron fist against defense~
less walls, Yes, and after supper, that
was dur time to play the game of destruct-
ion, Remember how that west wall buckled?

This summer, no Georgia.

And last summer, the food at the
cafeteria was always a subject for wry
(a very conservative word) comment. But
now that Mre, Little is in charge, we
can't even complain about the food,

By the way, fellas. Enjoy the
river while you can, They're going to |
build a dan right above the river bridge
before long. When the construction
woe begins, swimming will be out of
the question.

Last summer --- ah, last summer}
dow quickly it passed:

So that to do this summer?

Guess there's nothing left to do
out to study SES.

(OFFENSIVE BLLOING ;

Bidding is perhaps the most diffi-

cult aspect of playing a good hand
yof bridge. It is essential, at
times, to bluff your opponents by wild
bidding, but it is extremely distasteful
to be left at a bid of four diamonds,
when’ you have only six points in your
hand, and your partner has passed three
times, (You should have bid five dia-
monds, instead, as it is always wise to
try for game.)

One rule to remember is to never
let your opponents take the contract,
if you and your partner have anything
at all, It is much less embarrassing
to bid five and go down four than to
be relegated to the inferior position
of a defensive player, Was it not our
great John G, Calhoun, who, while lect-
uring on bridge to the U. S, Senate,
said: "The surrender of life itself is
nothing to the acknowlcdgement of in-
feriority".

The words used while bidding are
very important. For example, "A spade"
means something entirely different
from "One spade", Furthermore, whether
you shout the bid or whisper it should
have a very definite meaning to your
partner, These signals must, of course,
be agreed upon in advance by partners,
and both must understand them fully. __
