Forty Per Cent of Fresh Class
Taken in

TWO WEEKS RUSHING

Two Juniors Also Pledged by
Fraternities in Addition to
Number of Freshmen

With the pledging on last Friday night
of 91 men by the 11 national and local so-
cial fraternities here on the Davidson
campus, the 1928 rushing
brought to a close.

season was
Carrying out the
policy adopted by the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil last spring. the fraternities inaugurated
an entirely new type of rushing season,
only two weeks in duration and with few-
er restrictions on entertainment as com-
pared to the old system of two months.

Although the rushing season was gen-
erally understood as ending Friday night,
the actual rushing period closed at mid-
night on Thursday. A “day of silence”
was maintained, at the close of which
freshmen receiving only one bid were
free to go to the house of their choice.
Those receiving more than one bid held
30-minute conferences with a representa-
tive of the fraternity bidding them before
accepting an invitation.

It is of particular interest to note that
of the 91 pledged out of a class of 230,
three received three bids, 17 two bids, 71
a single invitation. Also to note the fact
that 80 from a class of 196 were pledged
at the end of two months’ rushing last
year as compared to the above figures.

In accordance with the Pan-Hellenic
rules no fraternity may officially extend
additional bids until one week from last
Friday night. After this date fraternities
may extend bids at any time.

The list of pledges will be found .on

Dr. J. C. Rowan, ’04,
Speaks at Vespers

An inspirational talk by Dr. J, C.
Rowan, ‘04, pastor of the First Presby-
terian Church of Concord, was the feature
of the third weekly Y. M. C. A. vesper
service of the year, Sunday, September
30. The audience was also favored by a
special number of music, C. E. Brown and
Cc. C. Orr playing the cello and violin,
accompanied by Paul Fry on the piano.

Dr. Rowan, former president of the Da-
vidson Alumni Association, took as his
text the 42nd verse of the 10th chapter of
Luke: “But one thing is needful: and
Mary hath chosen that good part, which
shall not taken from her.”
Though not directly stated, the central
message of Dr. Rowan’s talk was putting
first things first. A single statement,
though not characteristic of his usual
style, expressed vividly the whole task of
his thought: “Martha was putting pots
and pans before Jesus Christ.”

be away

Opening his talk by referring to the
emphasis of the opening phrase of his
text, “but one thing,” Dr. Rowan sum-
moned many striking quotations from the
Bible to bear witness to the fact that
when “one thing’ was mentioned it in-
variably meant that one thing was pafa-

mount. Christ to the rich young ruler:

“One thing thou lackest; go, sell what-
Paul: “But this one thing
I do, forgetting those things which. . . .”’

Dr. Rowan said that as he read this
story his sympathy had always been with
Martha. But a more systematic thought
shows the fallacy of such reasoning.
Martha's love, though imperfect in form,
is recognized as true, but it requires a
reprimand, “One thing is needed.” Aiter
explaining the situation into which Mary,
Martha aiid Jesus were thown, and Jesus’
soliution to the problem, Dr. Rowan pro-
ceeded to make a direct application of the
principle to our present needs.

SPONSORED BY LEGION

Finals to be Held on November
5th When Awards of Loving

be Made

The State Oratorical Contest sponsored
by the American Legion is to be held in
the colleges and high schools of the state
during the month of October.

The subject “The Duty of the
Voter,” and is a part of the Legion's drive

1s,

to get every voter to vote in the presi-
dential election as well as in other politi-
cal races. It is the hope of the Legion
in this that each local post will offer :
prize to the winner of the college contest
and thus create more interest in it.

The place is as yet undecided for the
state contest, but it will be held in some

centrally located city, probably Raleigh.
The time set for this is Noyember 5. At
2:00 p. m. on this day the preliminaries

This is one of the few times that a!

Requests From Other Colleges
and Charlotte Firms Necessi-
tate Change

Requests from colleges throughout
the state and from Charlotte firms
who are to assist in entertaining the
North Carolina Press Convention when
it is held here, have been so urgent
that the date previously announced as
October 11, 12, and 13 be changed that
the local committee has complied with
these and set November 1, 2, and 3.as
the time.

Conflicting engagements at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, and other
places make it inconvenient for attend-
ance at the meeting if held next week.
The American Photo Engravers As-
sociation is to be held in Cleveland on
October 10, 11 and. 12, and this would
make it impossible for engravers who
are interested in the local meeting to

attend,

Committees are at work on the pro-
gram here and at Queens College and
reports point toward a very success-
ful meeting. The additional two weeks
time will enable those in charge to
make more definite plans and_ will
allow for changes and improvements
in the general program.

Charles Pratt, vice-president of the
association is in charge of the general
program while Miss Jean Craig at
Queens and Aubrey Brown at David-
son are assisting at their respective
colleges.

Black, and Brock Shine

The Clemson Tigers resorted to an
aerial attack to give the Davidson Wild-
cats their first defeat of the season, win-
ning the game by a 6-0 score.

For two periods the Tiger and Wildcat
machines clawed at each other with Da-
vidson on the defense the majority of the
time. Neither team could do much gain-
ing against the other, punting being the
main form of attack. In this department
Clemson had the better punter and gain-
ed each time on the exchange.

In the third period the superior weight
of the Clemson players began to tell on the
lighter Davidson team. During this period
the Red Black outfit fought with
their backs to the wall as Clemson was
