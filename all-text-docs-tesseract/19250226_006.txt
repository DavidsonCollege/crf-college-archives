DR. PORTER ON SUNDAY

The Volunteer Band held its weekly
meeting Sunday morning in the gym, a
smaller number than usual attending.
Red McAlpine led the devotional exer-
cises and then introduced the speaker of
the morning, Dr. W. L. Porter, who gave
an informal talk on India.

Dr. Porter's talk was very interesting.
He read several passages from one of
the sacred books of Indian, The. Luws of
Manu, these describing various phases of
Indian life in a most viyid manner. ext
the speaker told of three great evils

of this vast heathen empire. On going

Women, he showed that in order to suc-

missionaries must sympathize with them
and understand their systems of ' belief.

true of Davidson and the University of

Representing the half of the Wildcat's

the Reds, taken from the other half, last

were made in the last quarter when the

the Reds tried in vain to stop the rally.

The first three quarters were scoreless
and till the last period the game was
anybody's. Then the Blacks showed
themselves the superior by putting the
{ball on the 20-yard line where a try for
place kick was made. In the closing
minutes of play Bohanon scored by a
blocked punt and Arrowood, star of
the Fresh squad, received a pass over
the line. The playing of Arrowood was
a feature of the game and the kicking of
