THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 1995 -

The Republicans have swept
into Congress with a fury, ending
40 years of Democratic control. In
a marathon “opening day” that
lasted until 2:33 a.m., Republicans
passed a series of internal rules
changes, including limits on com-
mittee staffs and certain perks, the
elimination of three committees
and 25 subcommittees, and rule
that requires a 60 percent
supermajority to raise income
taxes.

Many Americans were ex-
hilarated at the business-like at-
mosphere of the new majority, al-
though it limited debate on each
measure to 20 minutes. Newt
Gingrich, now Speaker, has con-
solidated a great degree of power
in his office — hardly an unprec-
edented act. He has restricted Re-
publican members from contact-
ing the White House, selected
younger members as committee
chairpersons to assure their loy-
alty, and assumed tight control over
floor business. The Contract with
America, written on every
Republican’ s heart, and Gingrich’s
list of suggested readings formem-
bers give the impression of a pro-

The Budget Debate

fessor lecturing to unquestioning
college students.

Because of this consolidation
of power and the division of party
power between the executive and
legislative branches, there will
come constant partisanship. Cer-
tainly the new Republican major-
ity will noteliminate gridlock; with
Clinton in the White House, it en-
sures it. There are two areas where
conflict is pronounced: the exami-
nation of safety-net Great Society

programs and the drive to balance’

the federal budget. Entitlements
and interest on the debt are now the
largest items in the federal budget.
A desire to preserve Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and welfare at
present levels presents a conflict
with budget restrictions. And bud-
get problems will eventually ne-
cessitate the reduction in some
benefits, barring sharp tax in-
creases. Certainly these issues must
be addressed together.

Unfortunately, with such a
charged climate in Washington,
politicians are unwilling to pro-
pose the spending cuts needed to
reduce entitlement growth andcurb
the debt. The elimination orreduc-
tion of some individual programs
is useful in moving toward a bud-
get surplus, but it is insufficient.
What is needed is an annual 2-4%
reduction, taken before inflation is
accounted, in every federal pro-
gram until the federal budget is
back at a surplus. Also, each addi-
tional dollar spent must be matched
by a dollar reduction in another
area. :

This plan has several advan-
tages: every program is affected
equally; officeholders are given
political cover; the cuts could be
phased in over many years instead
of dramatic cuts in a few programs
in the short run; federal depart-
ments, by having their budgets re-
duced, would be forced to find

ways to deliver services more effi-
ciently; once government feels the
painful effects of downsizing, re-
ductions in individual programs
would be forthcoming to retain
funds for important areas

The cuts would take effect au-
tomatically and continue at a pre-
dictable, prudent rate until the bud-
get returns to a surplus.

Some would argue that wor-
thy programs would be crippled
along with unnecessary ones. This
is true; some useful projects would
suffer. However, Congress has
proven that it cannot deal respon-
sibly with fiscal issues and lacks
the courage to make specific cuts.
The balanced budget amendment,
an unconstitutional political gim-
mick, and the proposed “middle
class” tax cut are examples of how
Congress puts forward sweeping
goals to disguise its lack of real
action. It is clear that President
Clinton, speaking in the State of

the Union about the national ser-
vice program, border patrols, and
job-retraining, regards certain
programs as untouchable. Mul-
tiply any one legislator’s pet
projects by 535 and add the
President’s own tax cuts and
demands, and it is no wonder
thatso much unnecessary spend-
ing clogs the federal budget. In
addition to officeholders, each
program has its own entrenched
interest groups who work tire-
lessly for its continuance.
Perhaps cutting 2-4% from
all federal programs each year,
without any tax cuts, is a radical
idea whose time has come; it
builds on the short-term deficit
reductions the President has al-
ready achieved. With a new
Speaker and such a partisan shift
in Congress, a bill that distrib-
utes pain equally may be the
only substantive measure that
Congress can pass and Clinton
is willing to sign. If Congress
feels that all current programs
are so necessary, why not ac-
knowledge political reality, cut
these “necessities” equally, and
spare any further posturing?

More O.J. Please. .

Flas the O.J. Simpson trial eclipsed
the skyrocketing Ricki Lake in the
battle for America's daytime T.V.?

I love the O.J. case. People
keep calling in to radio shows say-
ing how tired they are of the whole
thing. People keep writing maga-
zine articles, saying how they don’t
want to read about it anymore.

All right, fine. It is getting a
little old from the standpoint that
the case gets front page coverage
over a presidential address. I can’t
tell you how much I look forward
to reading about what I already
heard old Bill say on television the
night before. But the fact is, the
O.J. case is fascinating.

Pull away the details of O.J.
being a former car rental represen-
tative. Strip the fact that his Bronco
was seen on television driving
down a L.A. freeway for hours
during game seven of the NBA
championship. Forget the fact that
this is the most publicized case
since who knows what. Take all

that away and you still have your- -

self one of the most interesting and
educational television programs on
television.

O.J.’s “Dream Team” defense
comprises of some of the most
respected defense specialists in
their respective fields. The
prosecution’s Marcia Clark is as
good as they come (though I think
she could use anew haircut). What
better way to educate the public
on how our legal system works?

It is unfortunate that we have
to have one of our heros fall from
grace to get the public’s attention

— but let’s take advantage of the:

opportunity while we have it. I’m
amazed at how much interest
people have invested in this case.
People are canceling lunch plans,
calling in sick, and even skipping
episodes of “Riki Lake” just to get
a glimpse of the O.J. trial.

I applaud the television sta- -

tions for having such extensive cov-
erage. I can only hope that Judge
Ito lets the cameras stay on.

In the age of massive lawsuits
when people are suing doctors for
breathing on their patients wrong,
it’s become too easy and all too
common to sue. The aftereffects
are killing our economy and secu-
rity. The lawsuits are causing doc-
tors to charge more, insurance pre-

“ miums to skyrocket, and worst of

all, more and more people cannot
afford insurance.

Yes, I’m making generaliza-
tions and jumps with one specific
example, but the point is still the
same with all sorts of lawsuits.

Plus, I realize that O.J. is
charged with double murder; how-
ever, the point of lawsuits is the
same no matter what the severity
of the charge. The threat and ease
of lawsuits are taking advantage of
our legal system and are affecting
all of us directly and indirectly.

People simply do not under-
stand the complications and rami-
fications of lawsuits. Who can
blame the people when lawyers in
purple polyester suits are on T.V.
every other commercial pounding
the message “sue, sue, sue?” People
are vulnerable and they must be
educated.

Perhaps the O.J. case can make
more people aware that winning a
lawsuit isn’t as easy as it sounds.
You risk your private life, you lose
months or even years of your time
dealing with the case, and finally
the great possibility hat you might
even lose — no matter how much

‘evidence you have. If O.J. can get

off — anybody can (Yes, I believe
O.J. did it).

LETTERS

Some were offended by the light display, but it did
not harm male/female relations at Davidson.

Cole from page 7

Isat in the Phi Delt house studying
for exams, acohort of hers kept me
distracted as Rebekah and several
others climbed onto the Phi Delt
roof to change the lights. I find it
strange that she failed to mention
her part in the incident. Perhaps
the overall point of her article was
just too important.

Second, Rebekah’ s article con-
veniently omitted the steps actu-
ally taken to deal with the problem.
Rebekah confronted me in the li-
brary concerning the incident. Yes,
Ipleaded innocence, but I followed
itup with an apology and the prom-
ise that I would voice my displea-
sure to the light bandit of Phi Delta
Theta, which I did. I even went so
far as to make sure the lights were
unplugged every night thereafter.
Why were I and others like me
overlooked? I don't know. Maybe
my word wasn’t good enough. If
you question my word, you ques-

tion my worth asa person. Perhaps
reality just would have distorted
the basic truth of last week’s ar-
ticle. Yeah, that makes sense.
Well, perhaps I’m beating the
dead horse too much; I’ m afraid he
might come back to life. I have a
few more points to make, how-
ever. Okay, some peeples were
offended by the light display, but
does that really call male/female

relations or the abolition of frater- -

nities into question? I don’t think
so. If you have a problem with a
light display, voice your concern
about it. If you’re unhappy about
the social life at Davidson or in
general, say that. But do it sepa-
rately, or at least make solid con-
nections (Christmas break should
allow enough time for this to hap-
pen), and let everyone know that
you are speaking for yourself. I’ve

spoken with several Connor mem- .

bers who do not feel as strongly as
Ms. Peeples: Many are no longer
concerned, if they ever were. I

regret the fact that Rebekah’s letter
sounded, at times, like it was repre-
senting Connor House and even
women as a whole. Like I am
doing now, she was voicing her
own opinion, undoubtedly shared
by several others. However, I have
faith that the light display did not
harm male/female relations at
Davidson.

Ihave said my peace. I’m sure
someone, somewhere, was of-
fended by something I’ve said. And
they have that right. But I have
cleared my name. I can now look
my fellow students in the eyes
again. I want to let Rebekah know
that she should be disturbed, both
by the light display and by her
feelings towards the Court scene
here. But most of all, she should be
disturbed by the fact that she bla-
tantly disregarded several facts re-
garding the incident to make her
points. That disturbs me.

Sincerely,

. Brian Cole, 96
