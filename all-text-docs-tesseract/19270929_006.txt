THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 29, 1927

Jim Gray Out of Game
With Injured Arm for

Better Part of Season
Hampton or DeArmond to Replace

Him in Line

The Wildcat’s brilliant victory over the
Citadel Bulldogs last week was won at a
rather expensive price. Mingled with
the joy of winning the game was keen
regret at the injury of Jim Grey, depend-
able center of the Wildcat eleven. The
injury, resulting from an offensive play
with Davidson'in possession of the ball,
was a dislocation of the elbow, with a
small piece of bone chiped off. Grey was
taken from the field to the Gastonia City
Hospital where Drs. Moore, Klutz, Abel,
MacConnell, and Glenn attended him.’ Al-
though very painful at first, the injury
is fast healing and Grey hopes to be back
in the game after a period of several
weeks. Doctors believe that it will be at
least three weeks before the regular cen-
ter can be back in the line-up, but Coach
Younger expresses belief that it may be
even longer. However, if the elbow con-
tinues to heal rapidly, Grey will be back
at his position by the middle of the
season.

Grey, who is from Hendersonville, is a
Senior this year, and is regarded as one
of the mainstays of the team. He is one
of the eight letter men back this year,
althought this is his first year as a reg-
ular on the Varsity. It is hoped that his
injury will rapidly improve, and turn
out less severe than was at first feared.

There are two men of last year’s Fresh-
men team, who will temporarily: play at
enter. One is Ben DeArmond, of Char-

Dr. Martin Leaves for Philadelphia
in October to Speak at Log College

C.E.T.C. Will Send

Deputations Soon

The weekly meeting of the Christian
Endeavor Training Class was held last
Sunday afternoon at 1:45 p. m. in Shear-
er Hall. The leader of the class was
Everette Moye, and the subject discus-
sed was “How Christian Endeavor
Serves.” A very good number were
present.

The program was opened by a song
service in which a number of new songs
were tried. After this, Fred Poag and
James Jones led in prayer. Robert Kirk-
patrick then gave a talk on “The Chris-
tian Endeavor and Church Activities,”
and James Jones spoke on “Devotional
Service.” Jones also gave an echo of the
International Christian Endeavor Con-
vention which had been held at Cleveland,
Ohio. After a song, the meeting was
closed .with sentence prayers.

The Christian Endeavor Training Class
expects to start with deputations to sur-

lotte, who made an excellent showing at
center last year. DeArmond wa; sent in
for the remainder of the Citadel game,
and played a dependable, steady game.
Another prospect for center is K. D.
Hampton, of Raeford, who has been shift-
ed from tackle. With these two men fill-
ing Grey’s position, the Wildcats are
hopeful of making out until he is back in
the line-up.

The president of Davidson College will
leave here early in October for Phila-
delphia, in order to attend the 200th an-
niversary of the founding of the old Log
College near that city.

Log College was founded by a band of
Christian workers back in the year 1727,
in October of that year, and it may be
of interest to know that it was the first
Presbyterian college in America. Chief
among its founders was Rev. Willia
Tennent, a Presbyterian minister, and
pioneer of the Christian Educational
movement in the United States.

The college was intended to train men
for the Presbyterian ministry, and has
well fulfilled its mission in producing
splendid Christian leaders throughout the
land.

Log College, itself, has long since pass-
ed out of existence, but ‘this institution
was really the beginning of Princeton
University and Princeton Theological
Seminary, which partly explains why
these latter are under Presbyterian aus-
pices.

The celebration of the 200th anniver-
sary will last three days, from October
2nd to October sth. Dr. Martin will speak
at a dinner, on the subject, “The Common
Aims of the Christian College.”

rounding churches very soon. It also in-
tends to take up a systematic study of
Christian Endeavor problems at the
weekly meetings.

Davidson Men Take
Marksmanship Prize

Marksmanship honors at Camp ‘McCel-
lan, Anniston, Ala., was divided between
two Davidson shooters, Taylor and Julian
Lake. These two men were sent as rep-
resentatives of the Fourth Corps Area
to the national meet at Camp Perry, and
both made fine showings against the best
shots of the army.

Each year at the R. O. T. C. camp of
the Fourth Corps Area, held at McClel-
lan, competition is held for the honor of
representing the camp at a national meet,
this year held at Camp Perry. The two
Davidson advance course students who
on this honor were among ten of the
best shots of the. R. O. T. C.

At the meet at Camp-Perry, Taylor and
Lake were matched with the best of the
regular army, the R. O. T. C. and the
marines. Regular range firing at various
yardage and rapid fire were among the
events. Lake placed in one of these
events, winning a prize for his work.
Taylor came within one point of winning
his sharp-shooter’s medal.

two club rooms. In this part will also be a
reception and banquet hall with kitchen and
pantries. ;

The northern wing of the building will,
like the southern part, contain class rooms
and offices, there being 11 of the former and
15 of the latter, together with three depart-
mental rooms and nine laboratories with
necessary storage space. ;

The entire length of the building when
completed will be 312 feet, 30 feet more
than that of the old structure.

This imposing and beautiful structure will
replace the Old Chambers which was entirely
destroyed by fire in 1921, and the loss of
which was a great blow to the college.

The four columns of the Old Chambers
will be left standing as memorials and as
representatives of the old historic and tradi-
tional Davidson.
