6 THE DAVIDSONIAN

RE

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1996

"| Scott

There were no surprises at the
Democratic National Convention
of 1996; contemporary politics
were at their best.

The majority have become
caught up in the emotional
speeches, the multi-media presen-
tations and the election year rheto-
ric. However, after the balloons
were dropped, the songs sang, and
the tears shed a
void still remains

Lafranchi

ELSEWHE

Look beyond

tax credits for families with chil-
dren, tax credits for college educa-
tion, tax credits for
homeownership, and tax incentives
for companies who hire people on
welfare. Sounds to me like Dick
Morris, Clinton’s chief advisor, had
somewhat of an effect on moving
him towards the middle. But
Morris no longer works for the

Clinton and Dole

lars in debt: $5 trillion in funded
liabilities(bonds, ‘treasury bills),
and $15 trillion in unfunded
liabilities(social security and Medi-
care). At 7% interest we have an
annual fee of $1.4 trillion, and that
is just for the debt service. We only
take in $1.5 trillion per annum in
taxes, and obviously we do not
spend all of our taxes on the debt

service. Conse-

quently, it is

in the hearts of
those who dared |
to listen. Leader-
ship has not yet
emerged.

At the con-
vention, Al Gore,

I dare you to not be swayed by shallow rhetoric,
but rather to direct your attention towards
someone who speaks the truth, even though
they might come hand in hand with a pile of

clear that this
problem is om-
nipotent.

No, we do not
need the tax in-
centives. that
President

in the supposed
speech of his life,
grasped the heart
of America with the tobacco rid-
den death of his sister in 1986. It
was indeed a sad story, but why
was Gore without his anti-tobacco
vernacular in his attempt for the
presidency in ’88? Why was Gore
accepting funds from tobacco com-
panies up until his time with the
Clinton Administration? Why
would a man who had been so
profoundly changed from his
sister’s death turn around and tout
to a North Carolina delegation in
*88 about how he had proudly har-
vested tobacco, “with his own bare
hands.”

It is sad to say, but Gore did
those: things because he is a fol-
lower of the polls; he is not a fol-
lower of his heart.

One should read the platform
that was ratified at the Democratic
Convention. There are more at-
tacks against the GOP than actual
substantial positions or ideas on
policy. Furthermore, few new pro-
posals surfaced when Clinton
spoke. Oddly enough, all of the
proposals weredax cuts, the very
thing he so vehemently criticized
Dole for proposing a short time
before. The President proposed

charts, big ears, and a twangy Southern accent.

Clinton administration.

Which brings me to my next
point: character. EventhoughI do
not believe that the character de-:
bate should monopolize the policy
debate, one must wonder about the
integrity of a president, when they
have eight cabinet members under
investigation, their chief counsel
is dead, and their main advisor is
resigning because he was using
White House funds to support his
weekly escapades with a prosti-
tute.

After all of this, [can not bring
myself to understand how the del-
egates of the Democratic Conven-
tion can dance and cheer for a
president who refuses to acknowl-
edge the problems at hand.

He paints a picture of hope
with his colorful language and his
appealing demeanor, but are we
really listening to what is behind
the fluff, or do we even want to? It
is imperative that we adress must
address our financial gloom or at
least listen to someone who does.

Or will we continue to sup-
port a president who promises that
he will protect children, when he is
actually failing to recognize that
we have a total of $20 trillion dol-

Clinton is pro-
posing, nor
Dole’s 15% tax cut approach to
winning votes. Since when do you
pay off a debt by decreasing your
income? ;

At first glance one might say
that there are no more options after
Clinton or Dole. Difficult as it
may be, I encourage you to look to
someone outside the ranks of Re-
publicans and Democrats.

We need someone who has
consistently adressed the debt. We
need someone who has had suc-
cess in an executive position. We
need someone who listens to his
heart and has the will to follow it.

Idare you to not be swayed by
shallow rhetoric, but rather to di-
rect your attention towards some-
one who speaks the truth, even
though they might come hand-in-
hand with a pile of charts, big ears,
and atwangy Southern accent. Yes,
President Clinton can workacrowd
and Dole was indeed a war hero,
but that is not what being a presi-
dent is all about. Being a president
is about speaking the truth, follow-
ing through on what you say, and
leading the people.

So when election day comes
do what is right, not just that which
feels secure.

Election ’96

BY RACHEL ANDERSON

Davidson’s role in November

In November of 1994, low
voter turnout was reported among
Americans between the ages of 18
and 29. Many predict similar re-
sults in the upcoming presidential
elections with youth expected to
vote less than any other group.
Due either to apathy or disillusion-
ment with the political process,
today’s youth may be less politi-
cally active than previous genera-
tions.

Are these trends reflected on
Davidson’s campus? Some stu-
dents sense low levels of political
awareness and activism. Yet, cam-
pus-wide support for service
projects such as Habitat for Hu-
manity and the commonly-held
goal of helping others in a future

_ career belie a committment to the
community which is far from apa-
thetic.

Several factors complicate the
translation of personal beliefs into

a political choice. Voters are un-
certain about the efficacy of their
vote and are skeptical of politi-
cians’ promises to meet their de-
mands. Senior Tracy Privette com-
mented that although she has be-
come more aware of certain issues
during her time at Davidson, “‘It is
hard to know which candidate will
actually address those issues.”

As the general election ap-
proaches, political activity has been
increasing among students. Sev-
eral campus organizations are al-
ready preparing for the election
season. The Campus Forum Union
Committee will sponsor speakers
and topical discussions during
CROP lunch every other week in
the hope of increasing awareness
on major issues.

College Republicans and Col-
lege Democrats both report grow-
ing numbers, including many en-
thusiastic and dedicated freshmen.

According to Kelly Cunningham,
president of College Democrats,
interest had waned after the 1992
election, but is now even greater
than four years ago. “This is the
biggest and best organized group
since I’ve been here,” she said.
College Democrats plans to work
for voter registration in Davidson

and Charlotte, as well as partici- .

pate in some of the state and local
campaigns, :

College Republicans will also
hold voter registration and absen-
tee ballott drives before the Octo-
ber deadline. They plan to hold
events and publish a newsletter
focusing on issues of special im-
portance to students. College Re-
publicans vice-president Andrew
Marvin sees this year as a turning
point in national politics in which
many conservative-minded stu-
dents will become involved in the
political process.

International ...

¢ One thousand delegates, including activists and government officials
represented 130 countries at the World Congress in Stockholm, met in
Sweden last week. The international conference was designed to raise
awareness of the worldwide child sex trade phenomenon. The United States
Government did not send delegates.

¢ The British Government recently agreed to pay $1.6 million per year for the
next three years to a private consultant charged with managing the nation’s
latest anti-smoking campaign, named “respect,” geared toward young people.

¢ The Titanic’s remains are being recovered from their resting place just off
Newfoundland. Last week a section of the Titanic’s hull, weighing 21 tons
had almost been lifted to the ocean surface when the nylon cables which
supported it snapped, sending the piece straight back down to the ocean floor
two and a half miles below. After the mishap, the decision was made to call
off the $5 million expedition.

National ...

¢ A drug derived from the adrenal gland of common farm animals such as
cattle and pigs is the culprit in 54 recent cases of bacterial infection inhumans.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week put the nation on alert,
warning Americans of the potentially harmful effects of injecting the drug.
Adrenal cortex extract is not approved by the FDA, but is being billed as both
a key to weight loss and a treatment for burns.

¢ Cardinal Joseph Bernadin, the spiritual leader of Chicago’s 2.3 million
Catholic population revealed last week that doctors have informed him that
he will likely face death within the next 12 months. He was diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer 14 months ago.

Local...

¢ ValuJet officials confirm that the company will return to the airline industry
next month. Later this year, ValuJet plans to again provide service to provide
service to Raleigh Durham International Airport. Officials said service to
Charlotte/Douglas International Airport is scheduled to resume in 1997.

¢ Fans of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Phantom of the Opera” have already
snapped up 120,000 tickets to see the show during its seven and a half week
stay in Charlotte. Ticket prices range from $16.50 to 66.50. Phantom’s Third
National Company, which came to Charlotte in late August from Milwaukee,
will hold 64 performances at Charlotte’s Blumenthal Performing Arts Center
until October 19. Last week, the Charlotte Observer reported that only 8,000
tickets were still available. :
