‘THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 19, 1925

Puzzle This Week is Teaser From Start

to Finish and is Guaranteed to Please

John Russell Talley, who hails from the
city of spindles, was the winner of
week's cross-word puzzle contest. For his
trouble or pleasure, as it might be, he receiv:
ed a Davidson pennant to hang upon the walls
of his boudoir, This puzzle was made by
Fred Coffman, who is a civil engineer en-
gaged in construction work in Davidson.

The main complaint about the puzzles thus
far, is that they have been far too easy for
the intellectual luminaries of this institution.
One fellow said that he worked his puzzle
regularly walking up from the post office.
The puzzle this week has been worked with
the idea in mind of curing this seeming de-

fect. Fred Smith is the progenitor of the

last | thing, and it is guaranteed to be a sure’ cure,

sure fire antidote for an attack of mental
laziness. The words are not especially hard
but there are at-
tached to them,

To the one

some catchy connections
who brings the
solution to the managing editor, a subserip-
tion to The Davidsonian will be given. It's
easy, fellows. If you are an optimist, fill in
the squares with a fountain pen, if you are
dubious of your linguistic powers, work’ it
with a pencil and have an eraser on hand.
All members of the fair sex are invited to
participate. The way is open-

first correct

here goes!
