OR. SPARROW SPEAKS
TO MEDICAL SOGETY

Charlotte Physician Gives Il-
lustrated Lecture in Skin
Grafting

Dr. Thomas Sparrow of Charlotte
gave a very interesting lecture to
members of Alpha Epsilon Delta
and a large group of attentive visi-
tors in the faculty room at 7:30 P.
M. Friday, February 5th. He was
accompanied and assisted by Dr.
Hunt.

Dr. Sparrow’s talk was highly il-
lustrated. The first part was on
skin grafting, with slides to show
how it is done. A heart was shown
of a man who had drowned in his
own blood. Somehow the action of
the heart working against some
weak cells over a long period of
time forced blood into the man’s
windpipe. The audience was for-
tunate also in having the privilege
of examining ten inches of an in-
testine which had been cut out less
than a whole day before. The
former owner, a boy whovhad been
caught in an elevator, was reported
to be ,recuperating in Charlotte.
Other specimens were exhibited
and discussed.

SHAKESPEREAN PLAY
GIVEN LAST WEEK BY
AVON PLAYERS CAST

“Merchant of Venice” Present-
ed By Red and Black
Masquers

DIRECTED BY SELMAN

Audience Highly Pleased With
Performance

‘

On Wednesday night, Feb.
3, at 8:30 P. M., the Avon
Players presented “The Mer-
chant of Venice” in Chambers
Auditorium. The performance
was sponsored by the Red and
Black Masquers, campus dra-
matic organization,

The play, one of Shakespeare’s
best comedies, was under the direct
supervision of Joseph Selman, who
also portrayed the part of the Jew,
Shylock,

The original manuscript was
shortened, and several modern
touches were given to the comedy;
but for the most part the speeches
of the actors adhered closely to
those written by Shakespeare.

Experienced Leading Lady

Miss Marta Kytle, leading lady
of the company, played the part of
‘Portias Miss: Kytle was for some
time a player on the stage in Chi-
cago. However in recent years she
joined the Avon Players; and since
that time she has played in several
of the Shakespearean plays, among
which was Romeo and Juliet.

Mr--Selman-comes from Canada
where his grandfather was a
Shakespearean actor. Going to New
York, Mr. Selman acted on the
stage there for some -time before
entering Shakespearean work.

Perfor Well Attended

The performance was well attend-
ed by both students of the college
and people of the community. The
extensive applause showed that the
audience was highly pleased with
the production.

The Avon Players limit their
tours strictly to the southern states,
and present their production chief-
ly for colleges and high schools.
The company made its initial ap-
pearance this year at Brenau Col-
lege, and since that time has played
at other outstanding colleges in the
south, among whom are the Univer-
sity of Florida, Agnes Scott, and
Winthrop College.

Students at Mount Holyoke Col-
lege eat more than 1,200 loaves of
bread and 5,200 rolls in one week,

says Raymond Smith, college baker.

MISS ADELAID FRIES
LECTURES MON. NIGHT
ON MORAVIAN CHURCH
AND FAMOUS LEADERS

Subject Is Centered Around
Life and Work of Auguste
Spandenberg

AUTHOR OF MANY BOOKS

Planting of Colonies in Amer-
ica Is Described

Miss Adelaide Fries of Winston-
Salem centered her lecture on The
Moravian Church, Monday night in
Chambers Auditorium on Auguste
Gottlieb Spandenberg.

Born in 1704 in Prussia near the
Hartz mountains, Spandenberg was
the fourth son of John Spandenberg.
At sixteen he attended Jena Univer-
sity and received his education by
correcting themes and exercises for
professors, He was a Lutheran by
birth, but while at the university
he was influenced by Count von
Zinzendorf.

In 1771 Spandenberg was called
to the University of. Halle and was
made an associate professor of the-
ology. Because of his associations
with members of the Moravian sect
and his friendship with Count Zin-
zendorf, he was expelled from his
position. Leaving Halle he jour-
neyed to Herrnhut which was an
active Moravian community estab-
lished by religious exiles from Bo-
hemia.

Spandenberg came to this com-
munity and was initiated into their
faith. Opposition in Halle and
Germany was getting stiff, so ar-
rangements were made to transplant
colonies to America. The first big
problem of Spandenberg was to
organize the work in Savannah, Ga.
Succeeding in this venture, he trav-
eled to Pennsylvania where he es-
tablished a settlement at Bethle-
hem. Next came his trip to North
Carolina in which Moravians of this
section are vitally interested. After
many hardships Spandenberg and
his friends crossed the Catawba and
Yadkin rivers and arrived at a tract
of land near North Wilkesboro
which suited their purposes. They
arranged for the purchase of about
100,000 acres,. which now comprise
about two thirds of Forsythe coun-
ty.

In 1760, at the death of Zinzen-
dorf, Spandenberg was called back
to Europe and took charge of the
work of the whole Moravian church.

ANNUAL WORK IS NOW
DEVELOPING RAPIDLY

Baseball, Tennis, and Track
Pictures Delay Ath-
letic Section

Plans for this year’s “Quips and
Cranks” are well under way now.
The annual photographer was here
on Monday and Tuesday of this
week taking informal pictures of
Davidson’s faculty and the class
officers of the various classes. He
also took pictures of the basketball
and wrestling teams while here.

According to John Abernethy,
editor of this year’s annual, the
work on the classes has already
gone to the printer, including the
pictures, and write-ups on the
classes.

The fraternity and activity sec-
tions of the annual will be made
up within the next two weeks and
turned into the printer. The Ath-
letic section will be late getting in,
after April 15th, because of base-
ball, track and tennis pictures,
which cannot be made until these
sports begin.

PRINCIPALS DISCUSS NEWTON’S FUTURE AT STATE

DR. F. P. GRAHAM, President of North Carolina State College, “DOC” NEWTON, newly ap-
pointed State football coach, and COL. J. W. HARRELSON, Dean of State College are pictured above

Newton's acceptance of a contract which called for a considerable increase in salary over the position
which he held as head coach of football here at Davidson.

McEver Points to Good Season
Despite Loss

Gene McEver officially has
been named head football
coach here, succeeding Doc

Newton, who resigned to ac-

Chapman will be his first as-
sistant and line coach.

McEver came to Davidson five
years ago as an assistant to Doc
Newton, from the University of
Tennessee where he had just fin-
ished a brilliant career on the team
at the same university. He played
in the backfield for three yé¢ars and
gained national recognition in 1930
and 1931 when he made several All-
American selections throughout the
country Since*-his~stay at David-
he has acted as a_ backfield

Chap Is Assistant

Chet Chapman will be McEvers’
first assistant and line coach. Chap-
man acted in that capacity for the
last two years and he also has made
an impressive showing. He was of-
fered a position to go along with
Newton, but the advancement here
pleased him enough to stay. He is

also the freshman basketball coach

here. Chapman came here from
the Bowling Green University in
Ohio. He played on ‘that institu: |

tion’s football team and made many |
all-state selections in that state. He
is reputed to have made three dif-
ferent the selections.

When interviewed Chapman stated, |

year, but we will be in there fight- ;

head coach and if things turn out;

sented on the gridiron next year.”

Spring training has already been
started here and McEver points to
another good season even with the
loss of Doe Newton.

COLLEGE TREASURER
PROPOSES NEW PLA

Jackson Says That Damage
Fee Out of Date and No
Longer Needed

STUDENT BODY AGREES

Urges Economy in Use of
Lights and Water

Mr. Ff. L. Jackson, college
treasurer, appeared before the
student body Thursday marn-
ing during the chapel period to
get its reaction to a proposed
plan which would strike the
damage deposit from the reg-
ular list of entrance fees.

Mr. Jackson explained that al-
though the deposit had been taken
for more than a quarter of a century
the college would like to do away

with it, and that it might be pos-
sible to do so if the students would
pledge themselves to act always as
becomes good college citizens in the
preservation of property.

The college he said would accept
as the inevitable wear and tear on
the buildings caused by the use of
them by six hundred boys any gen-
eral breakage and damage while
still holding each student answer-
