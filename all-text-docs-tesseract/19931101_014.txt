Writing in the Boston Review

Tom Sleigh says, “At forty years

’ old and already the author of four

superbly written books of poems,

authority and originality that he
has permanently enlarged my
hopes and expectations for con-
temporary poetry.” The four books
are After the Digging (1981), The
Courtesy (1983), Happy Hour

olific Alan Shapiro will

(1987), and Covenant (1991).
Happy Hour won the William

Carlos Williams Award of the Po-.

etry Society of America, and poet
C.K. Williams called Covenant “a
marvelous work, one of the best
I’ve come across in years, and one
which grows richer and richer on
every reading.”

Shapiro was born in Boston
and received his B.A. Magna Cum
Laude from Brandeis University
in 1974. During the late ‘70s he
taught creative writing at Stanford
University, before moving to the
Chicago area, where he served as
Poet in Residence at the Univer-
sity of Chicago and as Associate
