New grid policy slated
To revitalize weak offense

By DAVE FAGG
Staff Writer

After showing little to no
offense in its first four games,
Davidson's head coach Ed
Farrell has decided to make
some changes in the Wildcat
playbook.

‘‘My coaching staff and I
met, and we decided to put
something new into our off-
ense,”’ Farrell said. ‘‘We want
to take advantage of our
strengths and talent.”

that since our quarterbacks
are not good runners, they
should not be in on running
plays,” Farrell announced.

‘We have also decided that
the fullback is not needed on
passing plays since we never
throw to him.”’

On the non-quarterback
running plays, the halfback
and the fullback will stand
where the center can snap the
ball to either one. This will

“Ten players will not make the mistakes

that eleven would.”

‘One of the big reasons that
we have been doing so poorly
is that we have made too many
mistakes on the field,’’ Coach
Farrell pointed out.

‘So to reduce the number of
miistakes, we have decided to
remove one player and just
play with ten men.

“The coaches reminded me
at our meeting that ten play-
ers will not make the mistakes
that eleven men would,’’ he
added.

‘We have made the decision

eliminate the quarterback fall-
ing down and bad handoffs.

Farrell believes that this
will confuse the opponent’s
defense. ‘‘They won’t know
what the hell we’re doing.”

Farrell has also added a new
passing formation to enable
the use of the fine talents of
center Chip Howell.

‘Believe it or not, Chip is
one of the fastest players on
the team and he has tremen-
dous moves and hands,”’ Farr-
ell proudly boasted.

‘‘He is not only a fine
center, but he can also catch
almost any pass.”

The Cats plan to unlease
their new strategy in a coming
practice session to be held
Sunday afternoon with the
Charlotte Hornets of the now
defunct World Football
League.

“T think that our first
scrimmage with the new sys-
tem should be a great suc-
cess,’’ Farrell said with ob-
vious enthusiasm. ‘Especially
when you consider that the
Hornets will not be able to
play, since the team has
disbanded.”

With such conditions pre-
valent, the Cats hope to be
mentally prepared for their
important contest with Ken-
yon.

team was a bitter pill for some.

Citing lack of Cat rack,
Farrell sets up training bed

Ed Farrell, head football
coach, established a training
bed to supplement the training
table.

Farrell had introduced the
idea of a training table two
weeks ago. This was set up to

“If It Happened,
You Will Read It
In The Davidson Update.”’?!?

if |, Buck Lawrimore, believed that, we would be
publishing weekly. But we aren't. Here are
a few of the things we do differently:

We follow the Wildcat Club. (The

Davidsonian doesn’t give a damn.)

Unfortunately, you’re missing _

a lot of “news.”

We print death notices wh

alumini promotions,
and Sam’s ideas of
program and policy.
(The Davidsonian
assumes that Davidson
is not perfect.) We
don’t probe so deep
and only point out
the good things TC
(to promote
Davidson's
reputation.)

We give you the best deals on
Davidson ties, blazers, and

rocking chairs—
(Subscriptions are free!)

Which is the point of all this.

We want you to
keep up with the
Davidson image.
Since The
Davidsonian won't
update you, we will !
That’s our job.
Love,

assure that the football play-
ers received a protein-rich
diet.

Since that time Davidson
has lost 69-14 to Lenoir Rhyne
and in that game set a NAIA
record, giving up 914 total
yards. Last week the gridders
held on to a 44-0 loss to the
Citadel.

According to the training
bed plan, all players will be
moved from the dorms to the
bunk beds under the grand-
stands of Richardson field.
The football players will sleep
as a group.

“The training Ded is a rather
drastic step,”’ Farrell admit-
ted, ‘‘but I believe that the
team’s performance warrants
the action.”

Players will be allowed to be
free from 8:00 AM to 1:00
PM and from 8:00 to 9:00 in
the evening. The players voted
to adopt the ‘‘training bed”’
life style on a trial basis.

“T like the idea now,” said
one football player. ‘“‘I wasn’t
too wild about the idea of
having someone rack me each
night.’

One unique characteristic of
the system is an arrangement
Farrell has worked out with
the Language Lab, to have
sleep-learning tapes and tape
equipment available.

“Not only can course mate-
rial be learned, but we alsa
have what we call our ‘atti-
tude tape’ drill. This tape
explains football plays, with
football cheers in the back-
ground. The tape ends \verth
the cheer ‘Go, go, go,..., :
said Farrell.

“Unfortunately some play-
ers have had their physical
problems. Plastic sheets have
been placed on cell mattresses.
This was not the type of
training bed we had originally
envisioned,”’ said Farrell.

Most football players felt
that the

mandatory t raining

table and bed are constructive
moves toward establishing
winning teams. They also
noted the convenierce of hav-
ing living quarters so close to
Richardson field, the gymna-
sium and the practice field.

‘It is too early to tell
whether the training bed is
working, but we have looked
at films of the training table. I
was satisfied with the passing
game, but there was too much
rushing at the food,” Farrell
said.

Ron Scott of ARA Slater
administers the ‘ training ta-
ble’ and has been instrumen-
tal in food preparation.

“The Slater food is strongly
offensive, but we have devel-
oped a new strategy. We let
Ron take the kickbacks,”’ said
Farrell.

“Ron has indirectly helped
create a decent running game.
Many of our players know
what the runs are now ”’

Farrell credits the idea of

the training bed to Tom Couch
who has scouted the Fort
Bragg Army installation

‘Of course the key to the
whole football program lies in
the hands of the coaches,’’
Farrell said. ‘‘We spend a lot

of time patting each other on
the back.”’
