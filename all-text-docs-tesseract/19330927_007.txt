Ye Ed can hardly say that he has
worked himself up into a frenzy of
over the \ way the team
showed up last Saturday in their ini-
tial tiff of the current season. The
Elon lads put up a stubborn resistance,
and a cocky Wildcat came off that
field not quite so cocky.

Orchids go to Paul Pittman, sensa-
tional sophomore halfback, and théere-
doubtable Eb (Schnozzle) Willson, star
fullback. Pittman, playing his first
varsity game, exhibited a display of
heads-up football that would do credit
veterans. His uncanny toe
greatly aided the Davidson cause, as
he punted out within the ten-yard
zone with consistency. Schnozzle
opened his final grid year with his
old-time from, ripping the Elon line
every time he carried the ball. His
33-yard jaunt in the third quarter was
the outstanding individual perform-
ance of the game.

The rest of the team played good
ball, with the work of Captain Rives,
Cathey, and Potter being particularly
outstanding.
to be the inability of the forward wall
to take the Elon men out. Time and
again Davidson’s' fleet backs were nab-
bed from behind before they had time
to get started. @

However, Davidson didn’t do so bad-

ecstacy

to many

The main trouble seemed

ly in-eomparison with what some of
its opponents did. The highly touted
N. C. State eleven was hard pressed
to trim Catawba 7 to 0, and V. M. T.

bowed to Emory and Henry, 20 to 0.,

William and Mary had a tough time
of it taking the measure of Randolph-
Macon at,12 to 0. Virginia was tied
by Hampaen-Sydney, as was Clemson

by Presbyterian, V. P. I.’s Gobblers
barely got away with their game
against. Roanoke College. So there!

Davidson didn’t do so badly after all.
Nevertheless, those Elon boys made

an A-grade monkey out of yours truly.)

The only drawback a five-touchdown
victory would have had would have
been that our prediction would still be
two touchdowns off. Never again will
the old boy underrate the Christians,
and spot three touchdowns. They’re
playing football down there now.
Now that the Elon game is. history,
the eyes of Davidson supporters turn
to the impending imbroglio with the
University of North Carolina Tar
Heels, at Chapel Hill Saturday. This
will be Carolina’s first game, and they
are priming daily for the ‘Cats.
Carolina has a strong forward wall
and a nice array of shifty backs, led
by Croom, Woolen, McCachren, Bur-
nett, and Martin. These boys can
play ball, but lack experience in play

this year, and by all rights the Tar

Heel machine should not click smooth-
ly in this opening encounter.

A special train carrying around two
hundred or more Davidson students
will leave here early Saturday morn-
ing, taking a Wildcat cheering section
to Chapel Hill. It is the plan of Hugh
Hawkins, varsity cheer leader, to take
the band, and his able assistant cheer
leaders, and really get behind those
‘Cats out there next Saturday.

Many Davidson students will recall
how last year Wake Forest journeyed
to Chapel Hill, decidedly the under-
dog in the pre-season predictions of the
press, and caught the highly thought
of bunch of gridders from Chapel Hill
untirely unawares, and came off, with
most of the glory in playing the Tar
Heels to a 0 to 0 tie.

The situation seems to be the same
this year. And despite early failure
as a gridiron prognosticator, the Ed
takes the liberty to say that he thinks

the stage is set for a one-touchdown
victory for the fighting Wildcats.
Watch ’em, boys! ~

not give the scouts in the stands much

That Davidson decidedly outplayed
Elon is obvious from the statistics on
the game. The 'Cats gained a total of
232 yards from scrimmage, as compared
with 60 for Elon. And in all depart-
ments of the game Davidson showed
superiority with the possible exception

of the success of a wild passing attack
on the part of the Christians that man-
aged to click, and form the nearest
|thing to a threat that the Elon boys
| showed all evening.

The Wildcats threatened once be-
fore their touchdown. Late in the first
period, Schnoz Willson got away on
a réverse, and ran 22 yards to Elon’s
3-yard marker, only to fumble, and the
ball was recovered across the goal for
a touchback by Newson of Elon.

That stellar Sophomore back, Paul
Pittman, stood out in the afternoon's
play, and he was closely pushed: for
‘honors by Schnoz Willson, dynamic
Davidson fullback. Troppoli of Elon
came in for his share of glory, dump-
ling Davidson players time and again.

In the Wildcat line Captain Rives
played his usual good game, and he
received able support from Cathey and |
Potter. Both teams used frequent
substitutes, and Davidson’s entire fleet
of pony backs, Ravenel, Hutchins, Pitt-
man, Willson, Burns, Pearce, Verble, |
and Wingfield saw action during the
game. Davidson was severely handi-
capped by the absence from the line-

was laid up with an injured knee. |

Among the football games played
last Saturday, four results will be of
special interest to Davidson students,
since in each contest one of the 1933
opponents of the Wildcats took part.

V. M. I. was swamped by a strong

took the Cadets into tow by a score
of 20 to 0. The date of our game
