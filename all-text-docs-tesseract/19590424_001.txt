The Davidson College

sity of Minnesota. The final

team coach Paul Marrotte and
team alternate Montey Bracey
arrived in Minneapolis at 4:00
Saturday afternoon, where they

checking in at the Hotel Pick-

guests of GE, where they met
the staff and management of
the program.

The team went out to the
University compus at 11:00
