Many of the presetit reserves are fresh up from the dayvees
and need some college experience. Louie Bingham is the most

lineup. Short for basketball. but fast and serappy. Louie
promises to stand with the experts in scoring this year. He's

Our congratulations to Coach Charlie in his new job as
head football mentor. He has the confidence and respect of
the team and student body alike, and we're right behind you,
Coach. Also, congratulations to Armfield Blocking Trophy
Winner Buddy Chandler and his sidekick. Car! Eborn, both
of whom were chosen by the Greensboro Daily News on their

The aiunual football banquet the other night was a fine
success. Latin Protessor Earnest Beaty, a man ‘‘least inclined
to physical everition,’’ made the main address. He showed the
boys that football is not only valuable through itself, but that
it can give them an idea of things that they may expect from
life. He showed that there is a great interest among the faculty
in sports affairs, even greater than we somtimes suspect.

Many glowing tributes were paid to Coach Story. and the
general grief over his resignation was apparent. The team
presented him with a watch, since they had noticed that he
often-needs one, especially when supper time is drawing near:

Letters and numerals were presented to the varsity, jay-
‘vee and cross country squads, and all these organizations were
commended for exceptionally good seasons. Ironically enough,
the most valuable harrier was not recognized with a letter.
Because of a pre-Thanksgiving misunderstanding with Coach
Whittle, Gundar’ Gray, who placed first in all but one of the
cross country meets, did not run in the Furman meet, and was
thus not among the letter winners. However, he was a valuable
man, and should not go unrecognized.
