[DAVIDSON NOW MEMBER
Red Cross News i OF AMER. UNI UNION

The necessary money has been raised
and Davidson has joined the American
University Union at Paris. ‘Vhis union
was organized in Paris largely thru the
Yale Lnivezsity. to afford comforts and
conveniences for the college men who
are fighting in Europe. Membership in
this union is open to all American Uni-
versities and Colleges. Its. constitution
declares its obiect to be “lo provide at
moderate cost a home with the privileges
of a simple club for American college
men and their friends passing thru Paris
aron turlough: the privilege to include
information bureau, writing and news
paper room, library, dining room, bed
rooms, baths, sdcial teatures, oppertuni-
ties tor physical recreation,  entertain-
ments, and medical advice.”

The making of the face masks which
is being done in the work room at pres-
ent, dees not demand much skill or ac-
curacy, We should like to encourage
every one over twelve years ot age to
give some time to helping fill our order
tor the month. A half hour or an hour
is better than no time at all. and we ask
your earnest interest in this work. It
you cannot come yourself, can vou not
send your daughter? Can you not watch
over your neighbor's children and let
her come? Tf you think of it as your
duty. can you not devise some wav by
which vou can show your interest and
lend vour aid? Would you be willing
that any one man who has gone across
from this community should suffer for
lack of what you, individually, have
‘failed to do? If you are praying for
the end of this war, have a care that vou
show by your works that you are in
carnest.

The women ot the Red Cross are
planning to have weekly sales of ice
cream, tea, and sandwiches. etc.. in the
Scofield building which has been gen-
erously loaned for this purpose by MLiss
Sadie. Scofield. It is hoped that some
funds to be used for local expenses can
be raised this wav.
