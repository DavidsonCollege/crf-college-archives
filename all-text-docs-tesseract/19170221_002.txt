NEEDED: CONVICTION.

There is one trait of character that is
sadly lacking in the majority of college
students, that is conviction. Questions
arise which are vital to every student,
and yet a large proportion of them do
not form any opinion, or if they do, they
do not uphold their convictions. ‘The
student body meeting Monday showed
this fact clearly. In the first place less
than half the student body attended.
Then when the question of a nominating
system was put before the house, there
was little discussion for and none against
it. And yet on the way out of the hall
several were heard to bring up objections
to the plan.

The same thing happened a year ago,
when it was voted to do away with all
forms of hazing, and yet the same men
who have objected most strongly to the
policy since, sat without objection or ex-
pression of disapproval, while it was
passed. So it happens in almost every
student body meeting. Let us have some
objection and conviction one way or the
other at the mectings and less “kicking”
about what was “run over us” after-
ward.

DAVIDSON PROFESSOR HAS
ARTICLE IN PERIODICAL

One of the features of a recent issue
of The Virginia High School Bulletin,
published by the University of Virginia,
is an article on “The Great War and the
Teaching of European History.” by Dr.
Tt. M. McConnell. This is an excellent
discussion of the method of teaching his-
torv in the light of present events. This
article is written especially for teachers
of history, but is interesting to all stu-
dents of history.

The purpose of the article is to sug-
gest several ways to increase the interest
of a student already interested in Europ-
ean history. Dr. McConnell savs this
can he done, first, by the study of geog-
ranhy. In this connection he says that
“A knowledge of geography is as essen-
tial to the successful study of history as
is a plot of land necessary for a house
site.” Second, the causes of the great
war should be examined. The writer
from his authoritative fund of knowledge

Alsace-Lorraine question; colonial ex-

disputes in some sane and amicable man-

Y. M. C. A. MEETING
TOMORROW NIGHT

The speaker for the Y. M. C. A.
meeting tomorrow night will be J. G.
Patton, '16, who is now attending Union
Seminary at Richmond. The meeting
will be held at 6:45 instead of at 7:00
o’clock in order to avoid conflict with
the meeting in the local church at 7:30
of the same evening. Patton's subject
on Thursday night will be “The Call to
the Ministry.” In order to assist in the
work among the students in connection
with the series of meetings which are be-
ing held, Patton will probably remain
thru the week.

SPECIAL MEETINGS IN
LOCAL CHURCH THIS WEEK

The week of special praver is being
observed here this week with services at
3:30 in the afternoon and 7:30 at
night. at which Dr, J. M. Clark, '86,
who is now Superintendent of Home
Missions for Concord Presbytery, is
assisting Dr. Richards in. the work.
Before accepting the position of superin-
tendent, Dr. Clark was for nine years in
the Home Mission work in Oklahoma.
Much interest is being taken by both the
townspeople and the students in these
meetings, and all who can possibly do so,
are urged to attend both the afternoon
and evening services.

STUDENT BODY ADOPTS
NOMINATING SYSTEM

At a meeting of the student body held
Monday afternoon a plan submitted by
a committee of the Student Council,
which has previously been adopted by
that body, for the establishment of a
nominating system at Davidson for stu-
dent body officers and members of the
Student Council, was unanimously
adopted. Under this system a commit-
tee of seven members of the Student
Council, four Seniors, two Juniors, and
one Sophomore, chosen by the Student
Council by secret ballot, will recommend
to the student body four men for Pres-
ident, four for Vice-presidents, and three
for Secretary and Treasurer. These will
be placed in nomination and voted upon
for the respective offices by members of
the student body, and others not recom-
mended may also he nominated, if the
student body sees fit.

The nominating committee of the Stu-
dent Council, or rather the recommend-
ing committee, will also recommend to

each class a certain number for the posi-| @

will be recommended to the Senior class.
five to the Juniors, and four to the Soph-
omores.
tions and in student body elections, the
voting will be by secret ballot.

The plan after being adopted, was|ff
to lie upon the table for two]

voted
weeks, after which time it will be incor-
porated into the constitution of the stu-
dent body. The point system, adopted
last Spring, and now in operation, was
also voted to lie upon the table for a
similar period. and will be made a part
of the constitution at the same time.
