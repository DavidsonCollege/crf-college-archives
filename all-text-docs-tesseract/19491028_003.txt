at little house down in the
down on fraternity court sure
"t look like the on® we were
to this week-end. Bro. Little,
been put in charge of the
tions, made a very good show-
ing and was to be commended on
his job, Pledge Scotty Stalling’s
many talents came to the front in
drafting the model gym, ani Bro.
Louis Rogers lived up to his fame
as a craftsman by building. a fine
spider and also by creating a mag-
nificent Wildcat whose chief duty
was to exterminiate all blue spiders
in sight. ;

Bro. “Littl Dave” Erwin,
Chandler and Carnegie put up a
terrific battle out there on = the
field—Carnegie even put up a few
private battles of his own which
added even more interest to the
game.

We were not unconscious of the
may beautiful girls with us over
the week-end. Some one (1 don’t
know who) said that Flo, Rod
Shaw's Floridian date, danced like
a princess. We noticed that Bro.
Ken Goodpasture was glorying in
his Monty-found date, Patsy Car-
son; Bro. Montee got to be the
fixer around here but not the fixed
—he shuffled around with sad eyes
the whole time: Bro. Charlie Bald-
win brought up another beauteous
Floridian in the person of Betty
Connor; we enjoyed meeting her.
Pledge A. C. Gregg’s date from
Wilmington, Libba Roe, impressed
your writer as being a most beau-
tiful girl—would like to see her
invited back. We are always de-
lighted to see Jack Blackwood’s
Patsy come over for a function for
we think that she is very pretty
and attfactive. Bro. Lamar was
‘Dooly (Neel) taken care of as long
as she stayed. Also Bro. Little's
Sally seemed always happy as did
Bill. Pledge Raymond Holland
seems to have latched on to some-
thing prétty good in Betsy, who
is another down-Wilmington- Way
girl. Bro. or Dr. Joe Miller brought
Ophelia, whom we didn’t get to
see enough to comment on. Yours
truly was also favorably impressed
with Pledge “Singing” Bud Dun-
can’s date, Nancy, fram Spruce
Pines, N. C. Max Morrison also
had a pretty date, but it is and was
beyond me. to remember her name

Everyone seenied to enjoy the
breakfast at the Minute-Grill and
we have Bro. Vaughn McAlister
to thank for it all—it was one of
the highlights of the week-end.
Brother Bud’ Aiken was Master of
Ceremonies and under the circum-
stances did an admirably good job.
‘Bro. Lane Cloaninger added to his
prestige by informing us all that
one does not have to smoke or
drink to have a good time; after
informing’ us of the great truth, he
sat down aid the next day he was
quoted to have said that he had had
a good time the night before! Well,
that is the bottom of the news as
it looks from here, ladies and
gentlemen—Ken Goodpasture.

yt:

Well .Homecoming has come and
gone and everyone is back at the
old grind. Memories of Homecom-
ing will linger on—Blue Barron's
music, the Sigs third place in the
Homecoming decorations, the foot-
ball field at ten p. m., Sarah, Nancy,
Norwood’s “pure” week-end, the
snakes, etc.

There was not a single time on
Saturday ‘night when all the Sigs
with dates were in the gym at the
same time, “Rube” never did get
to the dance. R. B. and Apperson
came to the dance sometime after
‘intermission, Beatie went out to
watch the football game—didn't get
penalized, did you? Carr and Clark
were last seen abdut 10:30. Grif-
fiths and O'Neal thought the dance
started at 10:30. Joe did a nice job
of keeping Louise out of sight.
All the stags were “snaking” -on
Francisco’s date all night. Tom
Abel was letting everyone kick
him for the fun that Phil Davis
-was having. Ben “Mars” Hamilton
was trying to snake on Norwood
all night.

There were also those who be-
haved themselves while their dates
were around: Doug, Vance,
Brooks and Betty Wayne, Harry
Wolfe, Phil Sellars, Swede, Stubbs,
Shriver (natch) Stewart, Nelson,

Powell, “Wistful,’’ “Gopher,” “The

Senator,’ Pritchar, Sweetheart
and Mr. Carr, and Mr. and Mrs.
Devant back “home” this week-
end.

. The week-end would not have
been a success were it not for the
untiring labors of Paul Eastman,
Marshall Dendy, and the others

nuts, ete, The thanks for the
“third place” decorations go ‘to
Kelton, Beatie; Blatt, Hamilton,

Mills, Graham; and Berry. They
labored hard and long on the dec-
orations idea of Covington and
Beatie. McLaney deserves mention
here also for the use of his car
for obtaining the materials needed.

The Sigs were very glad to have
Howard Paul and his date with us
for the week-end.

Court Apprehends
Freshmen Violators

The Court of Contre! swung into
action again. Thursday to admin-
ister justice to nineteen violators
of the freshman regulations. In
fairness to the freshmen, however,
Judge Doug Rice reprimanded the
upperclassmen for not turning out
for pep meetings and _ football
games. He pointed out that fresh-
man attendance at these events was
far above that of the upperclass-
‘men, and reminded the student body
that. the freshman regulations were
désigned for all the students. He
also requested that freshmen
should be informed of their charges
befdre being turned into the court.

The following freshmen were
found to be without hat at the hat
check: Fred Deaton, Al Miller,
Sam Hope, R. T. Bailey, Harold
Johnston, Joe Howe, Mark Falls,
Owen Kellum and Bob Wearn.

Others ‘who strayed from the
straight and narrow were: David
Robinson, daring an upperciassman
to turn him in; Bill Bradford, not
complying to an upperclassman's
request; Charlie Harrell, disre-
spectful to upperclassmen; Bill
Bledsoe, disrepectful to upperclass-
men; Vance Mizelle, attempting to
bribe an upperclassman to go easy )
on him, and grossly obnoxious;
Mickey Permenter, threatening an
upperclassman, and refusing ten
times to carry laundry; Phil
Davis, generally obnoxious; Harris
Asbury, no hat, walking on the
gtass and not speaking to upper.
Classmen; Avery Jones, refusing to
carry laundry; Howard Proctor,

secondly, the response of the alum-

the occasion was both enthusiastic
