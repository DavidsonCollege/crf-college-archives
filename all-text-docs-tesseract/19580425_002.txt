Davidson Enters The Space Age

The gift of $400,000 to the Col-
lege for the erection of a new science
building signifies the entrance of Da-
vidson into the space age.

Mr. Martin and the other members
of the Administration who were in-
strumental in the securing of this
gift are to be congratulated on their
success.

The addition of the new science
building should do much to bring Da-
vidson into step with the recent,
** ‘Sputnik’ motivated,” trend in edu-
cation to provide better facilities and
courses of study in the field of
science.

It would seem appropriate to con-
sider the role of Davidson in the com-
ing age, an age certain to think casual-
ly of space travel, and to see a flower-
ing of science beyond present imagi-
nation.

During the recent months, Ameri-
ca has become fascinated with science
and scientists as never before. The
comments of missile expert Werner
Von Braun are more avidly read than
those of President Eisenhower. High
school teachers are helping students

build rockets these days, not the tra-
ditional jalopy. Math and science cur-
riculms are being evaluated, and col-
leges and universities are expanding
their scholarship programs with ‘an
eye to give greater opportunities to
future scientists.

For the most part, this heightened
interest in science is producing good
results, especially in education. Yet,
the chief problem remains not how
to build better machines and bombs,
but what to do with them.

This world of technology, missiles,
satellites, and H-bombs needs as nev-
er before men of intelligence, good
judgement, and sensitivity.

The space age role of Davidson
College, and of similar institutions,
then’ must be to produce men able
to meet the challenge of a world rev-
olutionized by science.

If man ultimately triumphs over
his creations and learns to live at
peace with his neighbors, then Da-
vidson and all of the colleges and uni-
versities of the world will have justi-
fied their existence.

“It was a matter of seeing the
handwriting on the wall,”
answered John Trask, Kappe
Alphe’s IFC representative
when asked why he voted for
the abolition of Hell Week.
“Por the sake of student-facul-
ty relations, it was better that
the IFC take the initiative than
for the faculty to have to abol-
ish Hell Week.” This reply is
typical of those received in a
question posed to all IFC rep-
resentatives to get their rea-
sons for voting to abolish the
traditional pre-initiation activi-
ties.

Other representatives indicat-
ed that their votes were cast
against Hell Week because their
national fraternity did not sanc-
tion any such week. Bob Jones,
a Phi Gem and the old IFC
President, said, “Hell Week has
been strongly condemned by
my fraternity and the National
Interfraternity Council for
years... I think Greek Week
programs have proven them-
selves in fraternity systems all

over the country. It can be a
good thing at Davidson, too.”

Woody Woods, Beta repre-
sentative, said that “If the pur-
pose of a Hell Week is to make
better fraternity men of
pledges, the end does not justi-
fy the means.” Woody added
that, “I also considered that
no national fraternity on our
campus sanctions a Hell Week
or anything defined as such.”

Phi Delt, Pat Woodard, who
missed the meeting because he
was on the Male Chorus Tour,
indicated that he would have
voted in favor of the abolition
of Hell Week. He stated that
he is in favor of a Greek Week
and that, “the main purpnses
of Hell Week, unification of the
pledge class and the prepara-
tion of the pledge for brother-
hood, can be accomplished more
effectively by a more mature
institution.”

LITTLE CHOICE

Jim Zeh, representing the
Sig Ep’s answered by saying
that while he voted to be con-
, Sistent with his national fra-
ternity, “The IFC had very lit-

tle choice because Hell Week
was being forced out by the
faculty . . . we felt that the
action would be better received
by the Student Body if it were
IFC originated. It was also cal-
culated to help smooth out
faculty-fraternity relations.”

Jim Jones, speaking for the
SAE‘s, gave both better results
that should come from a Greek
Week and student-faculty rela-
tions as his reasons. Jim com-
mented that, “ ... the IFC has
attempted to bridge the gap be-
tween fun-loving students and
the more mature minded facul-
ty.”

Gray Lewis spoke out for the
PiIKAs and“... felt that the
end of Hell Week would bring
an end to certain liberalizations
on the campus.”

OFF CAMPUS

It was the hope of Don Car-
michal, ATO, that “the new
Greek Week would accomplish
traditional Hell Week values

. and make positive contri-
butions to institutions off the
campus.”

IFC’s action would give the Stu-
dent Body “. .. the opportunity
of retaining those parts of it
which are constructive and
which can be salvaged in a
Help Week plan.”

DISSENTING VOTE

Charile Stowe, Kappa Sig, was
the lone dissenting vote on the

IFC. It was Charlie's position
that, “ a properly managed Hell
‘Week has a very real place in
a pledge training program,”
and that, “in the light of pres.
ent conditions, this move
seemed to be an appeasement
to the faculty for this year’s
Hell Week rather than an at.
tempt to improve the fraterni-
ty system as a whole.”

Vernon Anderson, a Sigma
Chi and the new IFC President,
realized “ . . . the faculty
frowned on this activity and
planned to do away with it
themselves . . . Hell Week was
doomed . . Actually, it was an
appeasement to the faculty.”

Now that Spring Frolics, 1958 edition, has come and
gone, we can look back on it as being one of the few
dance weekends at Davidson that has been accompanied
by beautiful weather. Of course, clear skies didn’t exactly
make the weekend but they did set the atmosphere. As
one shy newcomer commented to an old timer: “I don't
know why he wants to go to the river this afternoon, it’s

too cold to go swimming!”

The students weren’t ‘the only ones to enjoy last
weekend. As I understand it, Dr. Schenck brought back

Spencer's Talk
Recognizes Facts

In his recent installation speech
as President of Mary Baldwin College,
Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, former Pro-
fessor of History and Dean of Stu-
dents at. Davidson, pointed out the
many problems facing Southern col-
leges and concluded that the only way
they can produce leaders with “real
wisdom and flexibility of mind” is
“by maintaining institutions of high-
er learning whose excellence is meas-
ured not by regional but by national
standards.”

“Let us face facts,” he continued,
“of the hundreds of colleges and uni-
versities south of the Mason-Dixon
Line, not one is now recognized na-
tionally as equal to the best in other
sections of the country.”

This, of course, is not news to
most Southern educators. Indeed.. it
has become almost a truism that
Southern colleges, as well as Southern
elementary and secondary schools,
are, as a whole, inferior to those of
other regions, and that even the very
best are on a lower educational level
than the leaders of other regions.

However, we here at Davidson,
both students and faculty (and espe-
cially members of the administration),
somehow cannot bring ourselves to
draw the simple logical conclusion
which follows from this fact: David-
son is a Southern college; no Southern
college is equal to the best colleges in
other sections; therefore, Davidson is
not equal to the best colleges in other
sections.

Unfortunately, however, this con-
clusion is quite true, and it will force
itself upon us whether we like it or
not.

We are, however, in a position
which will enable us to make a fresh
start, if we finally do remove the
blindfold of tradition and see our po-
sition as it really is, for our new pres-
ident, .when we finally get one, will
be in a position comparable to that of
Dr. Spencer at Mary Baldwin. He will
be able to—and, if we are not to lapse
into permanent intellectual stagna-
tion, he must—make certain basic
changes in policy that can pull Da-
vidson up into a position of equality
with the finest colleges in the coun-
try.

There is no reason to suppose this

cannot be done. We have a good phys-

proved upon. We have a basically
good faculty, even though a few de-
partments are weak and others under-
staffed. We certainly have a generally
capable student body, although few
of us, are utilizing our abilities to the
degree we would if we had gone to
certain other schools.

The main thing we lack is strong
intellectual (in addition to financial
and organizational) leadership, which
will be, as Dr. Spencer puts it, ‘“dy-
namic and imaginative in character.”
Only a President who will provide
this kind of leadership, who will face
the facts of our present condition
without attempting to hide anything
behind our local mythology of self-
congratulation, can make us an in-
stitution of national importance.

A Challenge To
The New IFC

‘Davidson's best organization man,
Bob Jones, turned over the reins of
the IFC Wednesday night to his suc-
cessor as President, Vernon Ander-
son.

This year’s Interfraternity Coun-
cil has made real progress toward
strengthening the Davidson fraternity
system. The abolition of Hell Week
and the institution of early rushing
should prove of lasting benefit to the
campus.

But all is not yet done. The pro-
posed system of preferential bidding
has not been adopted. It appears that
next year the newly built fraternity
houses, designed for sixty men, will
be occupied by thirty-five in some
cases and eighty-five in others. This
borders on the ridiculous.

Rush Week needs to be further
evaluated and a “Greek Week” would
be a pleasant addition to campus tra-
ditions.

It would be sad indeed if the pro-
gressive measures of the present
Council were not followed through
by the newly elected group.

The DAVIDSONIAN challenges
President Anderson and his Council
to take action immediately on a work-
able system of preferential bidding,
Rush Week improvements, and
“Greek Week’ plans so that the new-
ly founded tradition of progressive ac-
tion on the part of the IFC will not
be lost.

LETTERS TO EDITOR.

'5'7 Graduate Sends Advice

“From McCallie

Dear Editor:

Now concerning Davidson
College and drinking I have a
few things to say. First of all,
in this age of conformity IT

‘would much rather choose to

ees A AS I fA ee

conform to the strength in
puritanical ideals than to the
confused conformity which
breeds degeneration. .

Some would argue that free-
dom to choose is each individ-
ual’s innate and Christian and
necessary way of life. Others
will say that this is not even
practical because of the re-
strictions enforced by many
methods, not the least of which
is the immediate environment—
the authorities of the school.

The regulations that are es-
tablished are not foolishly put
together. The regulations are
established by those who know
through experience what ideals
are best for those who are young
in life.

MORAL COLLAPSE

The coach acts through con-
cern for his team, especially be-
cause the coach loves the in-

PEANUTS

dividuals on the team. Some-
times a player who disobeys or
goes astray freely (and he can
do so) without receiving punish.
ment comes back of his own
free choice, but sometimes he
sees that he can get by (at least
outwardly) in one break-2way
(and so he wants to hog the
ball) and he continues to stretch
the cord until it is severed and
he is lost in his own swirling
world. He pulls others with him.
This is pride. The good talents
he had rot within and spread
without. A fellow who breaks
a training rule causes a mora!
collapse all around him rather
than an immediate physical col-
lapse to his make-up.

UNLEASHED

Should the coach Ict the play-
er go his own way and should
the coach take the blame for
the boy? Could you accuse the
player for running rampont
when he finds himself unrepri-
manded, and could you blaine
him for blowing the news to
his group? Unleashed, he forms
a pack. This is what happens. A
school can fall into this condi-
tion when it pulls a few bricks
out of the foundation. The

coach and the players have got
to work together.

Think, too, of what you want
to pass both around to your
neighbors in the environment
and down to your next genera-
tion. If you accept the guidance
of those with experience, you
will find a warm spirit reaching
for your heart. If you accept

the freedom of sober-minded
fellowship, the discipline neces-
sary to mind and body, and the
faith of. our fathers, you will
find in a few years that you will
be thankful at first, loving with-
out, and respected through all.

“THE SHADOW”

In conclusion, “The Shadow”

isn’t the only one who knows
what evil lurks in the hearts
of men, for men themselves
know. But above that, men
know and seek the good. They
see the evil but they overcome

it. I believe that college stu-
dents are very close to being
men and that within their
hearts they realize that “know-
ing the best and choosing the
second best is the beginning of
moral and spiritual decay.”

Radio Free Davidson came back on the air last Sat-
urday night for its Spring broadcast. Many have. comment-
ed that it was a little overdone for the occasion.

We have received word from the ‘Movie and Arts
Committee for the Betterment of Culture on the David-
son Campus’ that it has met and assigned a rating of
4.385 to the 1958 ‘D-Club Foolies.’ Co-chairmen, Austin
and Reed, both commented that with this rating, it has
been placed in the upper division along with “Restless
Gun,” “And God Created Woman”, and “The Steve Allen
Show.” The committee also announced that two of ‘its
cast have been nominated for the famous “Woody” award
Max Bryan for his performance as a leading man and

Paul Biggers as the best supporting actor. Just remember
it had the Tankersly seal! Well, Spring is here at last; but
along with it this year came ‘Frost! . . ’

Dean Pietenpol and the Executive Committee have
just issued another word of warning to the student body
—‘No Student shall be seen sunbathing on the David-
Son campus except in areas prescribed by the faculty and
trustees. The only authorized area is to be the roof of the
southwest corner of Duke dormitory. Sunbathers wear-
Zorro strikes again ,

ing masks will be prosecuted.”

Elections Need

Within the past few months
there has been much talk about
campus concerning the inactivi-
ty of the Student Council and
the need of revision of the
elections system.

Criticism has been aimed
mainly at the fact that elections
are mere popularity contests,
that candidates promise much
but do little or nothing when
once in office, that the Coun-
cil does not always reflect the
wishes of its constituents, and
that there are no means within
the Constitution by which in-
efficient officers may be re-
moved from office.

The long-lost “Peden
Amendment” provided a so
lution to the first problem,
by way of an “open” elec-

By Schulz

tions system, but did noth-
ing more and was thus de
feated.

It seems that our present dif-
ficulties could be resolved by
the passage of two amendments
to our Constitution—one pro-
viding for an “open” elections
system and the other, for a re-
call of inefficient officers. The
former would eall for an elec-
tions board composed of a mem.
ber from each fraternity and
independent ‘social organization
which would govern all elec-
tions independent of the Stu-
dent Council.

Combines, combinations,
conspiracies and rellies
would be legalized. Cam
Psign costs would be ad-
ministered by the elections
board with the funds pro-
vided by a nominal filing
fee paid by each candidate.
Candidates would sign e
statement that on their
honor, neither they nor eny
member of their political
organization violeted any
election regulations (this is
somewhat idealistic.) Pen-
alties for infractions of the
rules would consist of dis-
qualificetion of candi-
dates—or immediate remov-
al from office.

The recall amendment would
provide the means for remov-
ing from the Couneil inefficien’
Officers. Upon the presentation
of a petition of recall signed
by at least two-thirds of the
student body to the elections
board, a plebiscite would be
held for removal of the entire
Student Council. Should it pass,
by a margin of at least three-
fourths of the total vote cast,
another election would be held
for a new Student Council. No
student would be barred from
Fanning.
