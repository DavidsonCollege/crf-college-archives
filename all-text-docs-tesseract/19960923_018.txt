THE DAVIDSONIAN _ . 18

Football booted in last seconds by Sewanee
Undefeated season dies on the foot of University of the South’s kicker

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

Sewanee, Tenn. - The Wild-
cats were looking to go 2-0 for the
first time since 1979.

They were were looking to
start the season with two wins on
the road for the first time since
1969, a season in which Davidson
won the Southern Conference
championship and played in the
Tangerine Bowl.

They were looking to win their
fourth straight over a team from
Tennessee.

They were looking to take an
unblemished mark into Saturday’s
Homecoming clash with Emory
and Henry, nationally ranked in
Division III.

And they may have been look-
ing past Sewanee on Saturday at
McGee Field, as the Wildcats (1-
1) fell to the underdog Tigers, 17-
16,on a 36-yard field goal by Ward

Cole with nine seconds left in a
game frighteningly reminiscent of
some of last year’s heart-wrench-
ing, late-game collapses.

“We’ve got no reason to be
overconfident,” said Davidson
head coach Tim Landis after the
game. “If they (the players) were
(overconfident), I wasn’t aware of

it. I really hope that wasn’t the ©

case. We’re a program on the rise
trying to get things done and we
can’ tafford to take anybody lightly.
“T give Sewanee a lot of credit.
They just moved the football. I
think our defense is pretty good,
and I’ve never seen anybody run
on our defense like that.” :
Led by quarterback Louie
Caputo (71 yards on just 8 rushes),
the Tigers (2-0) picked up 207
yards on the ground, much of it
during their second half comeback
surge.
Caputo also fired a 20-yard
touchdown strike to wide receiver

Davidson

James Spriggs early in the fourth
quarter to cut Davidson’s lead to
two.

But by that time, Sewanee
should never have been in the po-
sition to even start thinking win.

As Landis said, “We didn’t
have to make it that exciting.”

Davidson dominated the Ti-
gers for much of the game,
outgaining them, 332-298, collect-
ing nine more first downs (23 to
14), and holding the ball for 38:07
of the 60 minutes.

The Wildcats also converted
nine of 12 third downs, while
Sewanee managed just four of 11.

But as senior co-captain line-
man said, “Football’s a strange
game. We had our opportunities to
score.”

On its second offensive pos-
session, Davidson drove 72 yards
on 14 plays, as quarterback Tommy
Dugan connected on three straight
first down passes in third-and-long

situations.

But it all went for naught, as
backup tailback Nate Hagerman
coughed up the football at the
Sewanee 21.

Two séries later, the Tigers
capitalized on favorable field posi-
tion, taking ten plays to drive 31
yards to score.

Backup quarterback John
Stroup plunged in from the l-yard
line, giving Sewanee a 7-0 advan-
tage with 13:40 left in the first half.

After recovering a fumble on
the Sewanee 17-yard line,
Davidson had to settle for a 27-
yard Dunn Mileham field goal.

After the Wildcat defense
forced a Tiger three-and-out, the
offense crafted a 64-yard touch-
down march. Dugan found Ben
Brown inthe corner of the endzone
for a nine-yard scoring toss with
1:00 left in the half, but Mileham’s
extra point floated wide, as
Davidson settled for just a 9-7 lead

at the break.

The second half started auspi-
ciously forthe Wildcats. Jay Ariail
recovered a fumble at the Sewanee
39-yard line and Davidson capital-
ized, as fullback Eric Ferguson
powered it in from three yards out
minutes later, notching his first
collegiate touchdown and giving
Davidson a seemingly command-
ing lead with 9:58 left in the third
quarter. |

But it could have and should
have been more, as the Wildcats
threatened to score more but al-
ways sputtered deep in Tiger terri-
tory.

“The second half, in the third
quarter, those drives where we
drove the length of the field and
bogged down,” said Landis.
“Those were the key to the game.”

“They made the big plays
when they had and we didn’t,”
added Cowan. “That’s really what
it came down to.”
