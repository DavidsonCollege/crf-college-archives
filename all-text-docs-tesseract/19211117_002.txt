—Wildcats—

Georgia, Georgia Tech, Vanderbilt, and
Centre all can claim the Southern
championship, but dope seems to point
to Centre as the strongest team.

—Wildcats—

The Davidsonian wishes to thank the
Charlotte Observer for the correction
they made in their account of the Caro-
lina game. Near the end of the first
half Carolina had the ball on Davidson's
a-yard line, Johnson carried the ball
and upon being tackled by Brice of
Davidson, fumbled. Faison and La Far
recovered the ball making it Davidson's
ball on their own 2-yard line.

—Wildcats—

How the dope stands on Elon:

Elon 0, Trinity o.

Trinity 17, Wake Forest o.

Wake Forest 10, Davidson 7.

Looks bad but read on:

Wofford 20, Elon 7.

Davidson 87, Wofford o.

These scores are easier on the eye.

—Wildcats—

The Turkey Day game with Furman
will be the “Battle of the Century” ac-
cording to dope.

Davidson 0, N. C. State o.

N. C. State 7, Carolina o.

Carolina 7, S. C. 7.

Furman 7, S, C. 0.

Ga. Tech 70, Davidson o.

Ga. Tech 69, Furman o.

The schedule for this week is as fol-
lows:

Friday.

Furman vs. Wofford at Greenville.

Clemson vs. Erskine at Clemson.

Davidson vs. Elon at Davidson.

WILDCATS ALL SET FOR
ELON FRIDAY AFTERNOON

The last chance of most of us seeing
the Wildcats in action this season, will
be tomorrow when the Davidson eleven
hooks up with the Elon Christians on
Sprunt Field. Fur is going to fly for
the Davivdson machine cannot be stop-
ped because it has confidence, and plenty
of “pep.” Coach Grey has his warriors
in tip-top shape ‘for the battle. The
Elon eleven while not looked upon as a
formidable foe for the Red,and Black,
are sure to give ‘a good account of
themselves, and are going to make the
Presbyterians work mighty hard before
the afternoon is over.

The Davidson varsity longs for a
chance to show the state that they have
a better team than Wake Forest. Since
they cannot avenge their defeat at the
hands of the Baptists this year, they
are going to try to do the next best
thing. Elon and Trinity tied, Trinity
defeated Wake Forest, and the Wild-
cats are going to do their best to beat
Eion, because they have the old, David-
son spirit and are going to fight.

NEW BLANKETS ADD TO THE
COMFORT OF OUR WILDCATS

The Davidson College student body re-
cently showed their appreciation of the
noble way in which the ‘Wildcat foot-
ball team has upheld the honor of Old
Davidson, by securing for them 19 new
blankets, These blankets were a gift to
the Athletic Association and will be used
by all the athletic teams. They are
large black blankets, with a red, 12-inch
D, which makes them very attractive.

The student body voted that each man
should be taxed 50 cents, and this sum
of money was enough to obtain 19
blankets, and with the one which was
donated personally by Dr. J. M. McCon-
nell, there are 20 in all. They were
bought through the college commissary.

this brilliant back ‘gained 79 yards, or

more than half the 155 yards gained ‘by
the Davidson team from scrimmage. In
addition, two of his flying shoestring
tackles brought down Johnson when it
looked as though he was gone for a
touchdown. Schenck’s line plunges were
like arsenic and dynamite. Five first
downs were his neat total for the day.

In the firing line the Red and Black
front bulwark: looked like a cool mil-
lion dollars. But the trio that furnish-
ed more than their share of thrills de
Iuxe was composed of Faison, La Far
and Clark. Out on the right flank the
dynamic Faison played the defensive
game of his life. He seemed to play just
right for Johnson, his low vicious drives
always smashing the interference, and
often bringing down the runner also.
Judging from their work Saturday La
Far and Clark must have been fed up on
ram meat seasoned with T. N. T.
Johnson was Carolina. This great
protege of Bill Fetzer carried the ball
on three out of every five plays, and
seldom were his twisting, whirling drives
stopped without a gain: Kernodle, Prich-
ard and Blount also played great games.

WILDKITTENS HAVE FINE.
TRIP TO WILMINGTON, N. C.

The best scrub trip of the season was
taken by the Wildkittens when they
journeyed to Wilmington last Friday
to meet the Wilmington Light Infantry.)
It was one of the closest games that the
scrubs have played this year; the offi-
cial score being 3-0 for W. L. I., and,
though slow at times, was very interest-
ing.

Durnig the first quarter, the ball stay-

ritory; only once did the soldiers place
the ball within the forty-yard line of the
Wildkittens. De Armon and Boggs
made substantial gains through the line
but the Light Infantry had a defense for
the passes’ and end runs of their op-
ponents to such an extent that these
were not executed with much success
until the second half. Once in the first
quarter the ball was advanced to Wil-
mington’s eight-yard line. Here a
tackle play, an end run and two passes
proved unsuccessful and the ball went
over.

-Most of the second quarter was play-
ed in mid-field. Toward the. latter part
6t the quarter, Burnett punted the ball
well into Davidson’s territory, but the
hard fighting scrubs gained ten yards,
seven yards, five yards, and five’ yards
‘by line plunges. This ended the first
half.. Both teams seemed to have profit-
ed by the rest between halves and came
back with renewed strength and pep.
Mallery was replaced by Grey who
played steadily for the rest of the game;
Mallery taking end and Regen tackle
when McLaughlin, who had been play-
ing a sterling brand of football, was
knocked out.

In the third quarter, after the heavier
Wilmington team had reached the Dav-
idson 25-yard line, a pass was attempted
which was blocked by Alexander and
caught by Hodgin who ran for a touch-
down. - Regen kicked goal. While the
Davidson aggregation was preparing to
kick-off, to the infantrymen, a con-
ference was held between the referee,
umpire and the Wilmington players,
from which it was decided that a Dav-
idson player was holding, as a result,
the referee changed his decision and
penalized Davidson 15 yards .Rather
than quit the game, the determined
Wildkittens abode by the referee’s de-
cisions. This placed the ball on David-
son’s 20-yard line. The Wilmington
team was unable to advance the first
two downs. The third down,’a pass was
attempted which was grounded in the
end-zone. This should have been count-
ed as a touch-back but by bad judgment,
Wilmington retained possession of the
ball. Here, “Bo” Sheppard, the unrival-
ed star for Wilmington, stepped back
and placed a drop between the uprights.
This made the score 3-0.

The fourth quarter went to Davidson,
but the Kittens were unable to score.
Two passes were completed for a total
of 50 yards. But as darkness was fast
approaching the game ended with the
ball about mid-field.

TEAM GETTING WIRELESS
OUTFIT IN BETTER SHAPE

The college wireless outfit, which has
been at a standstill recently in it func-
tioning, is being repaired by the opera-
tor, B. L. Team, who thinks it will be
giving better service now. Team has
dropped out of college for the present
and is teaching at Bethel. He will re-
main here on the Hill if possible and he
intends to take up his work again next
fall. !

He is now installing a new system of
comparatively recent discovery which
eliminates entirely the use of the bat-
tery which has been the trouble spot
with the outfit here. No further change
will be required in the outfit as it is now,
the only alteration being the doing away
with the battery. For the benefit of
those interested in details, it may be
said that this new system consists pri-
marily of two “choke coils” and a small
“step-down” transformer and that an
I10-volt current is all the required
power.

It is thought that play-by-play reports
of the game here Friday will be sent to
Elon; although official acceptance of
this offer has not yet been received from
‘Elon. Team is now ina position to give
a greater part of his time to the work
at nights and is optimistic in regard to
the success of a! wireless outfit at
Davidson.

DEBATES RAILROAD STRIKE

The Freshmen Eumenean Literary
Society held a very interesting meeting
last Tuesday night a week ago. The
subject of the debate was: Resolved,
That in the recently averted railroad
strike, the employees were not justified
in their demands. The affirmative in
speaking order were J. R. Briggs, J. F.
Millhour, and P. M. Patterson; while
W. C. Ramsey and G. K. Taylor opposed
them. .

The bulk of the affirmative argument
was giving proofs showing why the em-
ployees’ wages should be lowered, and
illustrating the manner in which they
were striking against. the Government.
The negative supported their side by
pointing out how Wall Street and news-
papers were against the employees. The
rebuttal was the most animated part of
the debate. Taylor of the negative and
Milhour of the affirmative presented
especially. pointed and crushing argu-
ments. Three judges, appointed from
the Freshmen, voted two to one in favor
of the affairmative, and.the majority of
the house voted the satne way.

PHI MEMBERS HAVE REGULAR .
AND IMPROMPTU ARGUMENTS

The Phi Society held its regular meet-
ing last Thursday night. There was a
well prepared program which was car-
ried ‘out with plenty of pep.

The subject for‘ debate as announced
was: Resolved, That the Disarmament
Conference should not discuss the Jap-
anese policy in the Far East. The affirm-
ative outlined the plans for the con-
ference and showed that there would
not be time for consideration of this
subject.

The negative took the stand that this
was an important matter and could not
be discussed better at any other time
than at this meeting of all the really
great powers of the world.

The critic announced the subject for
the extemparaneous debate as: Resoly-
ed: That Davidson students be allowed
to vote in all elections concerning the
Town good. J. C. Wool, in upholding
the affirmative made his arguments
mainly on legal grounds. D. P. Mc-
Geachy . upheld the negative on the
grounds that we already have a student
government of our own, and that we
ought to make that 100 per cent efficient
and leave town politics alone,

FRESH PHI SOCIETY GETS
DOWN TO REAL SERIOUSNESS

A suppressed feeling pervaded the at-
mosphere at the Fresh Phi meeting and
every participant put forward the very
best that he had, it being the last meet-
ing of the year.

The affirmative was led by Gracy in
the question of whether the Japanese
policy in the Far East should be dis-
cussed at the Disarmament Conference.
He pointed out that Guam as a naval
base would command the Pacific and that
it is at this time being fortified. He had
a number of good points and. stated
the in a clear, concise way, then follow-
ed them up well, presenting one of the
strongest debates of the evening.

Brown ably led the negative, showing
that the discussion of the Japanese
policy would readily fit in with the Dis-
armament Conference and the disarma-
ment would not be effected while the
United States and other countries were
in ignorance of the plan of Japan.

The affirmative was supported by
Liles.in a splendid manner. In showing
that the conference on disarmament was
not the place for the discussion of
Japan’s policy, he did a great deal to
Strengthen his side. He had his debate
well in mind and presented it clearly.

Wharton closed the argument for the
negative. He told that President Hard-
ing: wanted to accomplish the same end
as the League of Nations, only using a
different means, i. e., that of the Dis-
armament Conference. That President
Harding had included the discussion of
the Japanese policy in the conference
and-that his expert advisers thought
that to be best, was indicative that it
must be the wisest course to follow. He
also pointed out that this is the best
time to discuss the Japanese policy. He
put some pep in his debate, delivering it
with a great deal of ease and backing it
up well in his rebuttal. His was pos-
sibly the best debate of the evening. The
judges decided in favor of the negative,

The critic gave some ‘parting advice to
the members of the society in which he
urged them to diligently pursue, and to
always keep up their society work as
something that they would never have
cause to regret having worked for.
