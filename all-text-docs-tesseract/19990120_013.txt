THE DAVIDSONIAN

While the Wildcats have rolled to
nine wins in eleven games, the name
“Davidson” is gaining some national
recognition.

The Lady ‘Cats rank #19 in Divi-
sion I for scoring offense, with over 80
points a game. “Our offense is going to
be there,” said Filar: “We've got so
many weapons.”

The team’s three seniors are lead-
ing the way in that category. Jamie
Brown leads the squad with 15.5 points

O’Brien, Magette, & Co. earning national

per game, Kerry Brown is averaging
12.5, and Jessica Montrella is averag-
ing 12.4.

Jamie Brown is shooting 54%
from the floor, 40% from behind the 3-
point arc, and 80% from the free throw
line.

Jen O’Brien is yet again raising
eyebrows across the nation, ranking 8th
amongst Division [ players in assists
(104), and 12th in steals (53). Her 11
steals against Sewanee on December 8
mark the nation’s second-highest one-
game total.

O’Brien struggled a bit statisti-

reco

cally early in the season, but returned to
form in early December. “Her. confi-
dence skyrocketed,” said guard JoAnne
Hassel.

“It just took a little time for her
game to come out. She’s a big player,
and everyone knows it this year. Last
year she kind of came out of nowhere,
and now the target is on her, and every-
one knows it. She’s getting used to that
new role, and she’ II be great.”

Another Wildcat, freshman Janna
Magette, has also caught the attention
of Southern Conference opponents.

With stifling full-court pressure,
the Wildcats‘jumped out to a 10-0 lead
in the first five minutes of the game.
Thirteen different players saw five min-
utes or more of floor time in the half,
and eleven different Davidson athletes
scored, Sophomore Jessica Heath led
the charge with sevenand Katy Kamp,
Jen O’Brien, and JoAnne Hassel each
added six points.

“T think we learned again tonight
that pretty much everybody can have a
role on our team on the floor,” said
senior Kerry Brown. “Anybody out
there can play and score and help the
team out, it doesn’t just have to be the
starters. We have a lot of scorers on our
team.”

So much for hospitality. College
of Charleston made their first trip to
Belk Arena since joining the Southern
Conference this season on December
20, but the Wildcats were not about to
put out welcome mats.

Senior Jessica Montrella racked
up 17 points and Katy Kamp added 12
as Davidson rolled to their fifth straight
victory. The Brown twins, Jamie and
Kerry, paced the team with 6 boards a
piece.

“Montrella is having an excellent
senior year,” beamed Coach John Fi-
lar. “She’s having the type of senior
year that you hope your seniors have.
She’s playing with a lot more confi-
dence, and she’s in great shape physi-
cally. She worked hard on the weights

this past summer, and it’s paid off for
her. Jess has been as consistent if not
more consistent than anyone all sea-
son.”

After returning from a much-ab-
breviated holiday break, the girls went
back to work with another solid victory.
The win marked their sixth consecu-
tive, and sealed a perfect 6-0 in the
month of December.

“You always: worry about how
you're going to respond after exams,”
Filar said. “ETSU is among the top
teams in the conferences, but we did a
good job of making some good runs and
then pulling away from them in the
end.”

All hail Jen O’Brien. The pre-
season favorite for Southern Confer-
ence Player of the Year staked yet an-

‘other claim for the honors with a spec-

tacular performance marked by 25
points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals,
and a solid 9-10 from the free-throw
line.

O’Brien’s effort was comple-
mented by double-digit scoring totals
from each of the other four starters, led
by Montrella’s 18. “That’s the way it
should be,” predicted Filar last Octo-
ber. “We should have anywhere from
five to six players in double-digit scor-
ing on any given night.”

The Wildcats went on a 10-0 run
over the last 2:26 to seal the victory and
the seventh notch for the win streak.

“This
was a great
women’s

game,” re-
called
Coach Fi-
lar. “It was
unfortunate
that we lost,
but it was a
great game.
We were
two very tal-
ented teams
that love to
run and get
up and
down the
court.”

tributed one of their best collective ef-
forts of the season. Jamie notched a
double-double with 23 points and 13
rebounds in 9 minutes. Kerry added 19
points in 26 minutes. The team’s third
senior, Jessica Montrella contributed
another solid game, with 10 points, 5
rebounds, and 5 assists.

But Georgia Southern scored the
final six points of the contest to emerge
victorious and snap the Wildcat win-
ning streak.

Kerry Brown’s 23 points were
not enough to rescue Davidson from
back-to-back defeats, and her Wildcats
fell to 3-3 in conference competition.

Greensboro’s Melinda Goodson,
ChoRhonda Gwaltney, and Samika
Foster combined for 63 points and 21
rebounds as UNC-G rolled to 5-1 in
Southern Conference play. °

Three different Wildcats fouled
out, adding to the frustration of the
afternoon. “It was the only disappoint-
ing game since we’ ve been back,” said
John Filar. “We went up there and
were another team. We_preach .how

often we want to be ‘us’ and we didn’t _

do that against them.”

Filar’s Wildcats seemed to suffi-_

ciently resolve their identity crisis in
time forthe return of the general student
population last Monday night.

The girls exploded for a Duke-
esque 19-0 run in the waning minutes of
the first half, effectively slamming the
door on Furman’s Lady Paladins. The
students in the stands erupted with a
frenzied show of support for the surg-
ing ‘Cats. ’

“It was great Monday night, it was
fantastic,” said Filar. “(The crowd) just
picks us up, our intensity multiplies big
time as the crowd gets into it.”

In the pre-season, Jen O’Brien
commented that, “A lot of us have been
working on footwork and quickness, to
be able to keep up the defensive inten-
sity.”

It’s paying off in big ways.

The Wildcat defense smothered
Furman, who at one point missed 16
straight shots. Those missed shots con-
verted into a multitude of fast-break
points that enabled Davidson to pull
away down the stretch.

Jamie Brown notched yet another
double-double (21 points, 12 rebounds)
on the night, while Jessica Montrella
added 18 points, Katy Kamp contrib-
uted 16, and Kerry Brown pitched in
14. O’Brien led the team with a re-
markable 13 assists as she continues to
climb the national leader board.

Another injection of talent this
semester will come from the increasing
play of freshman Leah Uhernik. After
seeing her in the first few practices of
the season, Coach Filar praised, “Leah’s
what I thought she. was when we re-
cruited her. Leah is going to be a huge
asset to this program, all-she needs is
some time. For not having touched a
basketball really since February, (she’s
doing) really well. Our fans are gonna
come to really thoroughly enjoy how
she plays.”

Three months later, the coach has
only grown fonder of his rising star.
“She’s getting stronger every game as
the season goes on, and you're going to
‘see her playing an increasing role in
every game. She cancome off the bench
and hit 3’s, she can shoot off the dribble,
and she’s a very good rebounder. She’s
a very tough girl.”

Davidson and ASU entered the
contest with identical conference
records of 4-3, but the ‘Cats prevailed
in decisive fashion in front of 727 fans
at Belk Arena on Saturday. Jessica
Montrellaled all scorers with 21 points,
and the 6’2” senior added 7 rebounds to
her name. Jen O’Brien showed off yet
another facet of her game, leading the
team with 8 rebounds.

Davidson only led by two at the
half, but a second-half run surged the
team to a 15 point victory. “I was
pleased,” expressed Filar. “As acoach-
ing staff,
we con-
sider ASU
as one of
the better
teams in
the con-
ferences.
They have
a lot of
weapons,
they have
an inside
game and
an outside
game. I’m

: pleased to
come
away with
a vic-

tory.”

Mike Anderson
was able to rescue the team from some
serious foul trouble. Jamie Brown,
Kerry Brown, O’Brien, and Montrella
each accumulated four hacks on the

afternoon. Two freshmen, Janna
Magette and Leah Uhernik, came off
the bench to absorb most of the blow.

’Magette saw 29 minutes of floor time
and Uhernik saw 14.

In that time, Magette racked up 15
points, 3 assists, and 2 rebounds, while
Uhernik accrued 6 points and 6 re-
bounds. Magette impressed the coach-
ing staff and her teammates with some
new moves on the floor. The notorious
3-point threat put the ball on the floor
with confidence, creating some great

scoring opportunities for both herself
and her teammates.

“We know that that’s the next step
for her to grow as a player—to put the
ball on the floor and not just be a long-
range threat,” said Filar. “Other coaches
watch tapes and they’re ready for her.
You hear them screaming ‘Shooter, #20”
every time Janna steps on the floor. But
she’s growing a lot as a player, she’s
making herself more multi-dimen-
sional.”

The coach also praised the fresh-
man from Alabama for her performance
on the other end of the court. “Defen-
sively, Janna’s looking better. That’s
one of her goals. That’s one of the areas
of her game that she’s trying to im-
prove. She’s taken some pride in that,
and she’s pushing herself to become a
better defensive player. We’re telling
people when they come off the bench
that they have to have that same defen-
sive intensity our starters have.”
