Sanford
To Talk

Tuesday

Terry Sanford, national
chairman of Citizens for
Humphrey, will speak in
assembly Tuesday as_ the
first of a new lecture series
at Davidson, the only one on
campus sponsored by a social
fraternity.

Sanford was to have been
the running mate for Senator
Eugene McCarthy. accord.
ing to ‘an interview with the
Minnesota senator in the
Miami Herald in August.
Sanford was also rumored
to be John F. Kennedy's
choice for vice president. in
1964, Sanford was known for
his emphasis on education
when he was governor of
North Carolina.

The lectures, to be sponsor-
ed several times yearly by
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, will be named the
Martin Lectures in honor of
D. Grier Martin, former pre-
sident of the college and an
SAE while a student at
Davidson. The fraternity is
seeking to raise $10,000, pri-
marily from alumni of the
fraternity, to sponsor the
series.

Charles F. Myers Jr., also
a former SAE at Davidson
and now president of Burl-
ington Industries, is serving
as honorary campaign chair-
man. Sariford will speak at
10 a.m. in Love Auditorium.

The lectures are an out-
growth of the “Blow-Up”
series sponsored by SAE at
Davidson last year, “born
out of a concern that the
social fraternity become ser-
iously involved in the life of
the college community," ac-
cording to Bill Smythe. one
of the program's initiators.

The ‘‘Blow-Up” series met
with such success that the
fraternity decided to perpe-
tuate them in honor of Mar-
tin, Smythe said.

He described the aim of
the new series as ‘‘designed
tu expose all Davidson stud
ents to wider ranges of. opin-
ion and personality.”

Sanford was elected to the
Davidson Board of Visitors
a year ago. His law partner.
Hugh Cannon. is a Davidson
graduate and an alumni
member of the Board of
Trustees.

Tuesday will be the first
time Sanford has spoken on
the Davidson campus since
he left the governorship.

Senate Raises Miscellany

Staff Writer

The SGA Senate approved
Tuesday a student activities
budget including a contro.
versial $1,038 increase in ap-
propriations for the Miscell-

the CRAP Report to provide
for a student Court of Ap.

The budget total of $28,600

for student activities is an
increase of $1,648 over last
year’s budget of $26,952. The
budget supports the activi-

The biggest increase in the
budget came in the area of

Charter

The Married Students Asso

granted a charter by the
Student Government Associa

dent of the M.S.A.

The main purpose of the
association is to improve the
quantity and quality of the
married students’ ‘housing by
presenting the college with
concrete proposals from a
recognized part of the col
lege community.

At present. there are seven
college houses available for
the 20 married couples. ‘‘We
cannot blame anyone for the
existing conditions since the
married students have never
before officially asked the
college for aid. nor have
they given any facts or

“We plan
President Spencer in the
near future to discuss the
problems and proposals of
the association with respect
to housing." Hazel said.

Hazel has designed an
apartment house with 20 units
which can easily accept ad-
ditional units when the need
arises. “The college badly
needs additional guest hous
ing facilities. With our pro
posal the college could ccn-

Democrat Bob Scott will be

ment.

“My impressions are that
Bob Scott will get it."’ Min-

Although Hubert Humphrey

Ellison: U. S. A Mixture:
Of ‘All Colors, Beliefs’

By CECIL BURNEY
Steff Writer

“I'm very proud to be a
part of the Negro American
cultural heritage.” This is
the way that novelist, essay-
ist and ‘“‘sometimes teacher"
Ralph Ellison describes his
position in saciety.

When the Reynolds Lec-
turer was asked why he con-
sidered himself a ‘‘Negro”
instead of a “‘Black" during
an informal coffee hour and
question-and-answer period
yesterday morning. he sald,
“I am a Negro because my
parents and grandparents
were Negroes. They fought
very hard for this identity,
and they tried to make the
term ‘Negro’ mean some-

thing honorable and respect-
ful."

Ellison, speaking in the
Morrison Room of the Col-
lege Union after a lecture in
chapel, stressed that he has
never been ashamed about
being a Negro. Instead, he
emphasized an ‘‘American"
heritage which peoples of all
colors and beliefs have in-
herited and of which he feels
Americans should feel proud.

“When I turn inside of
myself, I run into such things
as the ‘Bible.’ Shakespeare,
folklore stories, Melville,
nursery rhymes, Peter Rab-
bit, and there are a lot of
people in there, all recorded
on my mind as a part of a
conitnuing tradition,” he said.

Ellison's agenda during his
two-day campus visit also in-
cluded a talk at Philanthropic
Hall Wednesday and a read-
ing and discussion that night
in the Morrison Room.

Speaking about the crrent
trends of whites trying to be-
come more like Negroes and
Negroes more like whites in
hair styles, clothing, dancing,
and other mannerisms, he
said, ‘“‘Whites have been pre.
tending to be Negroes for a
long time from Eddie Cantor
and Al Jolson putting on black
make-up for their minstrel
acts up to the more recent
trends. Negroes have been
trying to pass for whites for

a long time, too.”

Minter said.

‘In local races so many
candidates are running that
the public doesn’t know
them,"’ he said. “The win-
hers will be the ones who
have the most money or who
are incumbents."' Most of the
latter are Democrats.

Because of the complex
nature of the national poli-
tical scene, state candidates
have been silent on many
issues. Rather than taking
Stands on local issues, most
have spent their time harp-
ing on matters that have
little to do with North Caro-
lina,

“Many local candidates
have to subject themselves

to national issues,"’ Minter.

said. “Gardner (Scott's Re.
publican opponent) figures
Wallace may poll more votes
than Nixon here, so he tries
to identify himself with Wall-
ace by saying the present
leadership can't even win a
two-bit war.”

In order to win, Scott has
shied away from the national
ticket and has sought to di-
vorce his stand from that
of the party platform, Mio.
ter added.

Although Wallace will prob-
ably run well in North Caro.
lina, his effect on local par-
ties won't be far-reaching.
“Wallace is a phenomenon of
this election," Minter said,
“and I don’t think his party
will take root in North Caro-
lina.”’

to Band Director Sam Ay-
cock. Driesell and football
Coach Homer Smith said
that the song should not be
played if it was “offensive
to unyone,”” Aycock said.

When “‘Dixie"’ was dropped
in the fall of 1966, Dr. Tom’
Scott, director of athletics,
cited objections from ‘rome
students and alumni.

The action drew criticism
and a petition circulated by
several Northern students,
and eventually the song was
reinstated by Dave Hoag, the
band's director.

Also banned with “Dixie”
in 1966 was the Confederate
flag that flew. atop the gym-
nasium. The flag has never
been returned. and the posi-
tion remains vacant.

“Dixie.” long considered
the Confederate national an.
them, was actually written
by a Northerner. Daniel Em-
mett. as a cakewalk number
for his New York minstrel
show.

Confederate soldiers adopt-
ed the tune as a cadence
call, and it quickly became
the symbol of Southern de-
fiance.

S’western
Following

Suit?

Another Southern, Preaby-
terian, liberal arts college
has decided to allow drink.
ing on its campus.

Opening its doors to John
Barleycorn last Saturday.
Southwestern at Memphis ap-
parently conceded its inability
to enforce the existing rules
which prohibited the posses-
ion of intoxicants on campus.

The college stated that the
students would still have to
obey the state and city laws.

The new rules were the
result of study by a student-
faculty committee which
took about a year.

Other recent action by the
Board of Directors of South.
western established student-
faculty committees to look
into other areas and thus
give students a greater voice
in college policy.
