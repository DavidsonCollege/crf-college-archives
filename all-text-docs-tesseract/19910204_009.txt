A Midwinter's Night

What do you know but it’s
deadline time again -- oh muse
send me verbiage . . . Thanks.

Something’s in the air. Balmy
afternoons and shorts clad future
leaders mark our days while mys-
tery snow. flakes and puking
pledges festoon the night.

Yes, it’s Midwinters time at
Davidson, again. Students lusting
after novelty can drop by the Un-

"Peanut" Scott

\ion before heading to Patterson
|Court for brew.
Ihopeterminology so far is not
confusing anyone. As my good
' friend Jaime Slagle has stated, “The
closest thing Davidson will ever
get to winter is Nuclear.” ‘Mid-
winters,’ you understand, is just a
generic term for “revelrous week-
end in early February.”

All I-can say is, don’t let the
oxymorons get you down; and keep
onkeepin’ on; and buck up soldier,
‘cause the beer really isn’t colder
on the other side of the fence, so
deal with it.

I’mlookingat the Union sched-
ule for the weedend’s events in
front of me here. It’s a little flier in
the shape of a snow flake; you’ve
probably seen them around. Two
things I like about this flier: first, it
is NOT generated by an apple
computer. The flake has a very
humane asymmetry to it that is
quite pleasing to the eye. Secondly,
the goings on look quite fun.

better job.

Perhaps Paul Newman said it
best in “Cat On a Hot Tin Roof” -
-“Smells like mendacity and high-

_ pocracy to me, Big Daddy.” Men-
dacity: given to or characterized
by deception or falsehood which
often is not intended to genuinely
mislead or delude. Well, it smells
like mendacity to me too, and
maybe this is my feeble attempt to
wash myself of some of it. I just
cannot seem to shake the feeling
that most of our humanitarian ef-
forts are designed to make us feel
good and rid our consciousnesses
so we can feel clean when we
become president of a bank or

an especially good idea. Opportu-
nities to run down fly balls with a
date come rarely, if at all, and
should be treasured.

Saturday afternoon features
that raucous comic troup “Skat-
fish,” formerly known_as. “Fish-
Scat” (with a ‘c’)and famous for
their hilarious brand of aquama-
rine bathroom humor. [Please
contact Doug Gibson for the ety-
mological origins of that last joke.]
In token tribute to our world at
war, Saturday nightcontinues with
a double feature presentation of

body procrastinating as one. Fac-
ulty representatives could be set
loose in ravenous consideration of
both sides of every issue while
battle weary citizens warmed there
backsides in front of Dan Rather,
and close minded males noted the
front-sides of all those Queenie
models gracing us with their pres-
ence.

We could make up a game in
which both sides lose and let the
sports teams play each other. Go

Factory” and “Strange Brew.” Hey

~ Hoser,I hear all Saddam Hussein’ s

chocolate factories got blown up,
eh. No way Hoser, want a beer,
eh? ;

While certainly well inten-
tioned, I am not sure that Saturday
night’s festivities fully service the
often voiced need to safeguard
troop morale through abject homo-
geneity. A truly complete and
Conciousness Raising midwinters
week should include what I’Il call,
for the hell of it, a “Super Vigil.”

Let me explain. We all recog-
nize our essential itty-bittyness in
the face of a way-big world. Soli-
tary: individuals:can;do precious
little to reshape earthly things; in
fact, we’re not even sure if as a
group we can make much of a
splash. But we all want to do our
part.

It seems to:me that the most
you can do is find out what you’re
best at and just do it well and with
all your heart. So what I have in
mind is this Super Vigil thing. All
the members of the Davidson
community could come together
insingle minded tribute to our Chief
and do what they’re best at -- a
festival of competency if you will,
with unity as our goal.

Please envision: Liberals
marching, conservatives conde-
scending and the whole student

senior partner of a law firm:and
buy a Mercedes and a Rolex.

Before the whole campus
comes down on me, there are two
notable exceptions: those who
don’t pretend to want to save the
world and those who, in one form
or another, do affect positive
change in the future.

The students and faculty that
donot belong to either of the afore-
mentioned groups should be
ashamed that they pay lip service
to the Davidson ethic.

I am. To those who greet this
letter with indignation I hope I am

wrong, lam only calling itthe way —
Iseeit. On the other hand, I’ll just ~

refer you to an epithet D.A. Th-
ompson used on the author once

upon a time,

when the Cushmans would show;
pledges humiliating themselves for
a cause, PA system feeding back,
and beer for all and all for beer as
the Union Board candidates cap-
tured the nexus of the Davidson
soul-force in one gigantic poster.

The more things change, the
more, etc.

I ran this idea by fellow stu-
dents and received mixed reviews.
David McPherson stated, “Hell, I
don’t know what to think,” and we
all appreciate his input. A dreamy
eyed Randolph Lewis waxed

absract. Quoth he, “I honestly be-
lieve that pop music can help solve .

our problems in the Middle East.”

Huh? .

“Well, it’s sort of a groove
thing...

Gothcha. Such musical naiv-
eté, however, can only remind us
of the Great One, Kenny Rogers,
and his lines from the 1970’s intro-
spective, “If She believes In Me:”
Ifshe was my girl/ I thought! could
change the world! with my little
songs! But I was wrong.

Oh! Kenny, we hear ya’.

I’ve always found it fascinat-
ing to observe the maturation of
Rogers’ intellect as he aged, got
rich, and decided that if he couldn’t
change the world he could at least
buy asignificant portion of it. Hope
ya'll enjoyed the weekend.

misfortunes. It is easy and even
comforting to find excuses to blame
someone else for our own prob-
lems. It is not right, however,and
in the end, it only makes women
look bitchy and irrational.

I am a woman. I want to be
treated with respect, and I want
equal opportunities. But I don’t
want to be associated with the bit-

ter feminism that Sara and other |

“campus feminists” espouse. It is
unwarranted, unfair, and unneces-
sary. I think it’s time for a new
cause.

Sincerely,

be ultimate allegiance.

As for the American flag, we
should not shelve it either, simply
because it is a symbol sometimes
hated. It too should be thought-
fully displayed. Tobum the Ameri-
can flag is thoughtless. To mind-
lessly salute it is equally thought-
less, But when we display the
American flag along side the flag
of the United Nations, we demon-
strate a most thoughtful display of
our commitment to the ideals for
which it stands.

Sucha statement seems appro-
priate now. President Bush has
continually articulated to this na-
tion and the world, that this struggle
against Saddam Hussein, and the
tyranny he represents, is a collec-
tive one. Not only are American
lives being risked. Kuwaiti, Saudi,
Yemeni, Qataran, Egyptian, Syr-
ian, Isreali, Italian, British, French,
and the peoples of many other
nations are at risk from warfare or
terrorism.

Iraqi lives, like the Iraqi mili-
tary officers who refused to invade
Kuwait and were executed, and
too the innocent civilians of Iraq,
who have been and will be ac-
cidently killed in this conflict, are
also risked in the name of this
struggle.

Thus, the pride we feel for our
country should not stem from our
ability to “kick ass,” but rather in
our moral and political leadership

debated today. The writings are
controversial because everything,
including national and local gov-
ernment, is fluid. As recent events
of the international political scene
have reminded us, the communi-
ties of the world are not in a state of
stagnation. Communities do not
simply continue because a paper
says that they will. There is per-
petual change, both positive and
negative, from the level of
Davidson College to that of the
world of nations. This is because
rather than reaching an ideal state
we have only established an en-
couraging set of basic rules by
which we will work to accomplish
future goals.

That applies also to the Col-
lege community. We must con-
tinue to improve upon our own
surroundings if we are to see it
survive and thrive well into the
future. Fortunately, we are a col-
lege community based upon mu-
tual respectandasenseof personal
honor. Although those words may
sound cliché after several years at
Davidson, at one time or another
each of us has been thankful that
we live and study among fellow
students of such a high caliber.
The United States, as a nation, is
similar to Davidson in theory but
has lacked one fundamental ele-
ment. Based uponreasonable laws
and the ideal of mutual respect and

inrighting a wrong. Our pride flows
from the realization that the prin-
ciples which we declare, we live.
When we do not live by these prin-
ciples then flows our shame. Who
does not indeed feel some shame
when the United States break in-
ternational law. Can we feel just in
the mining of Nicaraguan harbors
for example?

Still, who does not at least feel
some pride in American leader-
ship in making the United Nations
work as it was envisioned. We can
take pride in the fact that our coun-
try is presently enforcing interna-
tional law. We should, all of us,
hope that such acts will become
the norm rather than the exception
as our world becomes increasingly
interdependent. All should realize
that our. national pride rightly
surges from these higher principles
and aspirations.

For these reasons, I for one
intend to always fly my American
flag along with my-UN flag. The
American flag flys most honestly
and purposefully then. And I hope
that it will from this day forward
always fly there proudly. We
should demand of ourselves and
our country that it does.

Finally, to my fellow South-
erners like Derrick and all those
who might unnecessarily take of-
fense, I also promise that should I
ever feel the need, perhaps while
eating those collard greens I so
dearly love, to fly a Confederate
flag, I will do so beneath these
others which represent mostclearly
my commitment to’ justice and

freedom.

‘
«» equality, one difficulty: with, the

nation asa whole isthatwe lack the
feel of a community.\Over the
years Americans have drifted away
from the original concept of bind-
ing together in a nation-state for
ourcommon welfare. Because we
have maintained the concept that
our. nation-state should be dedi-
cated to our mutual well-being and
that. the United States of Amer-
ica’s government, in present form,
willserve as that nation-state, hope
is not lost. We all can be more
aware of ourselves, our local
community and the world around
us. It begins by talking to the
person next to you. 5
Thetitle of Ms. Jordan’s speech
was, “A Republic, If YouCan Keep
It.” Thechallenges intrinsic in that
title are mind-boggling. Though
Ms. Jordan’s concept of american
nationalism is vague in both the-
ory and practice, we are citizens of
a nation and we all must work to
enhance the partnership of the citi-
zen, the community and the nation
if indeed our partnership is to
continue. I certainly hope our
generation fulfills her wishes.

““When_a people shall have be-

come incapable of governing them-
selves, and fit for a master, itis of
little consequence fromwhat quar-
ter he comes.”
