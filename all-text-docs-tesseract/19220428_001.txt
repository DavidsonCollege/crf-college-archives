Reorganization of Blues
Under Cover of Darkness

Blue Armies Advance Though Shot
to Pieces, Say Advices From
the Front.

(The Davidsonian’s Special Correspond-
ent with the Blue Forces in the field).

Blue Headquarters—Somewhere on
the Golf Course, April 26, 1922—As night
falls the tired remnants of the First
Blue Army are engaged in organizing
the many metres of newly occupied ter-
rain. Fearfully shot to pieces, due to the
incompetency of the officers and their
cwn rashness, the broken ranks are
wielding pick and shovel in a desperate
attempt to entrench against the expect-
ed counter attack. Reinforcements are
on the way but will they reach the sore-
ly beleagued First in time? That is the
question on the lips of all of the higher
officers.

With most excellent spirit the Blue
waves moved to the attack. The fearful
gaps caused by the Red machine guns
were quickly filled and the thin Blue
lines moved forward as if on: parade.
Indeed the very eagerness of the men
was thevcause of many casualties—they
needlessly exposed themselves time and
again.

shelter was near at hand, there was en-

inadequacy of the communications.

As well as can be learned the purpose
of the day’s fighting was to drive the
Reds from their strong position on Cem-
etery Ridge, just north of Hoyt’s Val-
ley. Whether that purpose was ac-
complished or not cannot be accurately

heavily shelled, but to what extent? It

little Scotchman, General McIlwaine,

SCENE OF TERRIBLE ENCOUNTER

MEN AND EVENTS IN
THE DAY’S FIGHTING

(Special Correspondence to The David-
sonian.)

The Leader of the Blue Left.

‘Brigadier General MclIlwaine, who
commanded the Blue left in yesterday's
assault on Cemetery Ridge, is in many
respects a man of contrasting charac-
teristics. To the casual observer he
looks the scholarly soldier—impeccable
spectacles surmount the aquiline nose;
perfectly fitted puttees grace his nether
extremities; he is quiet, unassuming. But
see him when the bullets begin t6 whis-
tle—his eyes shine, his knees quake, his
hearts-beat, tersely he snaps out orders;
it is then that the fire implanted deep
down in his bosom from a long line of
fighting Séotch ancestors leaps forth.
So it is that his men idolized him and
began to call him “Uncle Mac,” soon
corrupted into “Nuncle,” by which so-
briquet he is now known throughout the
service.

In a review of yesterday's fighting be-

there any considerable activity. A very

BEHIND THE LINES
WITH A RED REPORTER

(By Special Reporter to The Davidson-
ian). :

The Hoyt Valley Red Line.

The fighting along the Hoyt Valley
section continues to be the most severe
which has yet taken place on the Da-
vidson-Grey” Farm front. Hill 702 was
yesterday the object of attack by the
Wlue forces advancing from Concord
Koad, The Blues outnumbered the Reds
the latter took this
casion to stage a most strategie with-
drawal from their six hundred yard po-
sition in front of Hill 792.

Morale of Red Troops.

When the bugler sounded the assem-
bly on Thursday afternoon not a man
of Company A, Army of the Reds, was
missing; every face was cager and every
cye sparkled; for these veteran troops
knew that they were again to see action
in the front line trenches.

Major General Richards gave a few
words of encouragement to his men, a
few short orders and the whole body of
troops commenced the to take
their places along the Davidson-Grey

Farm front. Here as defenders of Hill

As a result of the military genius ex-

Distinguished Service Cross and is to
receive promotion in the next few days.

The organization of Hill 792 in its de-

| Most perfectly worked out arrangement
of guns and men with which Blue troops
j have had to contend. The details of

by special permission of Field Marshal

Kelis. . It is felt that information con-
j cerning the wonderful way our: officers
| are conducting the war should be given
| the Davidson public.
| The defense of the hill consisted of
[three combat troops placed at intervals
in the edge of the South Slope Woods,
ja machine gun covering each flank, a
number of Stokes Mortars located within
\the woods, and a series of reserve posi-
| tions to whichvit might be possible to
| fall back in case of strategic necessity.

jatong this front shows at once the ex-
cellence of this choice of positions, for

fire on the enemy and both of them
