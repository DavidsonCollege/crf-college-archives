If you like “who-dun-its” this is
it, or_at_least. this is one of them.
However, some novelty is intro-
duced into this plot by having the
first body (the first in a series
of bodies) delivered to the home
of a“Hollywood film, actress.

It seems that the~- unidentified

In order to assure the corpse of
a constant supply of clothing, he

“WICKED”

it seems that the writer of this
column is doomed. to at least par-
tial failure before he begins. Every
week there is one, and sometimes
more than one picture on which
fo” material can be found. This
weck the picture which has been
able to escape all -editorial com-
ment in other publications
“Wicked.” However, there is very
good and logical reason for this
deplorable situation. As everyone
knows, Davidson_is a college com-
munity (please drive carefully) and
as such has ‘been very thought-
fully placed “far from’ the madden-
ing crowd's ighoble strife.” Ateach.
gate of entry strict censorship has
been maintained on all printed
matter imported. Only once, many,
many years ago, did literature
which was thought unfit for the
minds of Davidson men, enter this
“holy city.” These books were later
burned at a public ceremony. It is
due to this strict censorship ex-
ercised by men in responsible posi-
tions that no printed matter con-
cerning a picture of such a ques-
tionable and suggestive title has
been able to enter the town.

Think It Over

By MALLOY OWEN

CHAPEL

Tt has been the custom and
policy of Davidson to require at-
tendance at mid-morning Chapel
exercises five days a week for
many years. 1t is. our opinion that
those who established this practice,
as well as those responsible for its
continuance_used_and_ are_using
wisdom. _

“Surely it is in keeping with

* the Christian attitude of the
type student Davidson wants
to set apart a time early in the
day for the reading of the

Scriptures and prayer, led by

professors, students or guests.

Furthermore we believe it to be

a source of relaxation as well as
inspiration, as the traditional “audi=
ence participation” gives everyone
a laugh. Coming in the midst of
it
comed break, to say nothing of its

our morning classes is a wel-

giving our student body a sense of

solidarity (a happy advantage of
small colleges), --  -

However, we believe certain
minor adjustments would make
this D. C. tradition more ef-
fective. Therefore the follow-
ing suggestions are respectful-
ly offered.
