DELINES

DAVIDSON FOOTBALL fans have had the dubious
distinction of seeing the ‘Cats play some of the best)

small-college teams in the South this fall and tomorrow
they’ll get a chance to see one of the best in the North.

For those of us who had never heard of Lehigh

before it appeared on the

‘59 football schedule, and

for those who just don’t know much about the Engi-
neers, here's the lowdown:

LEHIGH IS a non-denominational, private institu-
tion with a male undergraduate student body of approxi-
mately 2700. It is located in Bethlehem, in the heart of

steel-producing Pennsylvania.

The Engineers are members of the NCAA and
play in the Middle Atlantic Conference. They‘ve been
playing football since 1885 and have a respectable

football tradition. In 1957

they won the Lambert Tro-

phy, symbol of small college supremacy in the East.

LEHIGH HAS a 48-man football team with only five ing’
seniors. Twenty-one of the squad are from Pennsylvania, fe
11 from New York and 10 from New Jersey, with the |

remaining six from other Northern states.

Although he claims to be rebuilding, Coach Bill
Leckonby has two capable quarterbacks, a big, fast

backfield, a mobile, though young, line, and fine ends. |

Leckonby was “Coach of the East” in 1957.

The Engineers, members of
the Middle Atlantic Confer-
ence, accomplished last week
what few teams have man-
aged to do the past two years
—namely, hold the reins on
VMI. Where the Wildcats
were crushed by the Keydets,
34-7, Lehigh gave them a
scare, losing, 7-4.

The Engineers also routed
|previously unbeaten Tufts Col-
| lege, 63-0.

The powerful Lehigh back-
field features sophomore full-
back Boyd Taylor, a 200-pound-
er who, according to coaches,
could become Lehigh’s most ex-
citing runner in a long time. He
is flanked at the halfback po-
sitions by another sophomore
Al Richmond, who possesses a
rushing average of six yards,
and Al Kovach, also a top-
notch defensive man.

attack is quarterback Bob
Scheu, a junior.

Davidson will be counting
on its able, but physically
fragile quarterback Charlie
Benson to lead the Wildcats
to their second victory of the
season.

Wildcats Face
Wolfpack Today

By BILL THOMPSON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson’s high-riding soccer squad journeyed to Ral-

| eigh this afternoon to play what may be their final game

{ State is the Wildeats’ third
ACC foe this. year. Davidson's
only two losses of this season
came at the hands of the pow-
erful, nationally-ranked Univer-
sity of North Carolina team.

“The squad certainly is
eager to beat State. There is
no question about the desire,”
Coach Paul Marrotte said
early in the week. “They
want to take State to prove
that the win over Duke was
no fluke. They really want
to beat two ACC teams in
one season.”

Last year, State dropped the
‘Cats 2-1 in an overtime here
at Davidson, Marrotte said that
earlier this year Duke beat
State 40 to 1, but that it is not
known whether or not State
was at full strength for that
game. “I imagine that State is
a lot stronger than that, com-
paratively,” Marrotte stated. ‘?

We're ready for State. and just
hoping for some breaks.”

The State team is made up
of foreign students. Most of
the Wolfpack players are
fast, good ball handlers who
are very shifty. Earlier this
season, they were one of
twenty-five nationally-ranked
teams. However, the loss to
Duke may have eliminated
them from NCAA tourna-
ment possibilities.

The soccer team may have
one other remaining game, It
is not known if-or where the

contest with Emory, scheduled}

for the 21st of this month, will
be played. Marrotte said that if
the State match proves to be
the last of the season, seniors
Ward McKeithen, Tom
Joe Dulaney, and Milton Gee
will be. playing their last

games.
