ED. NOTE: As_ reported
on page one, many of the
fraternities have already de-
cided or are deciding what
response to make fo the
fraternity reforms outlined
by the “Committee of 18.”
Because of the importance
of these recommendations
for the future of soclal life
at Davidson, THE DAVID-
SONIAN is. here publishing
the complete text of the sug-
gested reforms.

TEXT .

The changes envisioned in
the design of this program
are aimed mainly at remov-
ing social, organized ,exclu-
sion, and at making a new
non-exclusive social pro-
gram work creatively and
financially. It is hoped that
all the main obstacles to a
better social program for

Davidson have been cover-
ed,

There are four  possibili-
ties as to what might hap-
pen to small group activity
on Patterson Court:

1. The fraternities might
accept the college’s plan,
keep their charters, and re-
main in their houses.

2. The fraternities might
accept the college plan, lose
their charters, but remain
in their houses as locals.

3. The fraternities might
refuse the college plan, keep

their. charters, and leave
their houses on Patterson
Court.

4. The fraternities might
elect to cease operations,
leaving thelr houses vacant.

‘There will probably be in-
stances of all four situations
on the court next year, and
the ecollege« must be ‘prepar-
ed to meet each situation.
However, for the remainder

2. Over the Christmas- Ho-
lidays, 1970, each freshman
shall be assigned randomly
to one of the twelve houses,
to take benefit of the social
life of the house and to eat
a lunch and an evening meal
a week at the house during
the winter term. This is a
part of the’ new orientation
program for freshmen.

3. At the beginning of the
spring term, each freshman
shall be reassigned to a dif-
ferent house by means. of
random selection, and he
shall be allowed to take part
in the social life offered and
eat a lunch and an evening
meal a week at his
house.

4. At the end of this year,
each freshman, or upper-
classman, who desires to do
so, shall list his preferences
of houses with which he
wishes to associate at the
beginning of the next aca-
demic year.

5. For the remainder of
this academic year no social
organization occupying one
of the twelve houses on Pat-
terson Court shall be requir-
ed to admit freshmen to its
meetings; however, ‘on no
condition shall certain fresh-
men be allowed to attend
the meetings while
freshman assigned to the
house is excluded from such
meetings.

6. The college wishes to
maintain the officers of the
houses on Patterson Court;
their services as elected of-
ficials of their houses will
be vital during this transi-
tion period,

7. The college’ shall guar-
antee the continued -employ-
ment of housemothers and
cooks through the current
academic year (June 30,
1971).

. the fraternity system, as it is presently

constituted at Davidson College, should be eliminated,
aS soon aS a more adequate social system can be de-

vised to take its place.”

Student Life Committee, June, 1970

of this year and throughout
next year, the .chief concern
of the college must be di-
rected primarily toward the
first two possibilities and
the need to guarantee the
success of the houses, both
national and loca) that elect
to remain on Patterson
‘ Court. <

The main thrust of these
guidelines, then, will be di-

‘Any house. desiring the
college to assume responsi-
bility for financial obliga-
tions incurred prior to the
present academic year, un-
der point four in: the Trus-
tee Resolution, must follow
the regulations outlined be-
low. (1-12).
