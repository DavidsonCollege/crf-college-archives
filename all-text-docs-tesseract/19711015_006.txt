LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Allen Receives Belated Praise

The following letter is written
to columnist Bobby Allen con-
cerning his September column
in THE DAVIDSONIAN.

To the Editor:

The Randolph-Macon Sundial
printed as an exchange article
your column ‘What We Really

Need Is a Dose of ‘Men's Lib’ "
in today's issue. .

I laughed: I loved it. You
speak the truth. Being a fresh
man, I've been subject to the
rigors you described. You were

so apt in describing these
“wonderful Virginia gentle-
men.”

Cross Raps Story

To the Editor:

John Kepchar's article on the
Young Socialist Alliance con-
tained a number of inaccuracies
that need to be corrected.

The article said that we feel
that capitalism is ‘‘too unstable
a form of government."' Capital-
ism is not a form of govern-
ment. It is a system of allocat-
ing resources and producing
goods and. services.

in a Capitalist economy the
4overnment is controlled by the
capitalist. class. regardless of
whether it is formally a de-
moecracy. an oligarehy, or a
dictatorship.

“Liberalism” and “‘conserva-
‘ism are two wings of capital-
ist ideology: the difference be-
tuwscen them is whether the in-
stabilities of capitalism can be
solved by welfare programs or
police action. We do not regard
either solution as practical.

Nonetheless, if the system
tolerates our right to protest
against it. we will use that
right.

Kepchar also says that I said
that “Britain has a good sys-
tem. I am not a supporter of
the British Labor Party. Dur-
ing Harold Wilson’s six year
premiership, no attempt was
maue to nationalize the steel
industry.

Even when steel was nation-
alized during the 1945-1951 La-
bor government, it was a bu-
reaucratic nationalization which
gyuve the workers in the mill
né sense of participation in the
management of the mills where
they worked

Socialism is not government
eontrol: it is workers’ control.
This means direct participation
by the workers in the decision-
making at the factory. There-
fore we do not regard Britain.
the U.S.S.R.. or mainland
China as countries we would
like to emulate.

In fact, the YSA_ considers
Soviet Russia and the People's
Republic of China degenerated
workers’ states, which need a
political revolution. This poli-
tical revolution would demand
treedom of speech and thought
and workers’ control of the fac-
tories

Kepchar s article did not even
mention the Alliance's support
of community control of police
and schools, which would give
black people and chicanos in
this country a large measure of
self-determination.

The article says that the
¥SA is “in’ favor of women's
tree day-care centers for work-
ing mothers, legal and = free
abortions on demand, and equal
pay for equa! work.

Several past national
men of the YSA have
“chairwomen.™

The article says YSA favors
the October 13 Moratorium, but
mention that the

chair-

Alliance also supports the No
vember 6 anti-war demonstra-
tions in six major cities around
the country.

Blind dates are primarily the
major entertainment for the
first three of four weeks of a
girl’s school. The sophomore
across the hall always needs
ten or twenty dates for her boy-
friend’s fraternity brothers.
he dates have to be freshmen.

Are we just naive enough to
believe the lines necessary for
getting along with some male's
“devirginization’’? You did fail
to mention the quintessent dis-
cussion of what a line is and
isn't.

(L.e.. “IT wouldn't think of do-
ing this."’)

What is this? Why not be ex-
plicit? Why not just be explicit?

If all a boy wants is two tits
and an ass, why not caél up
the nympho—everybody knows
who's one by now-—and ask her
out? Instead, he has to make
a pretense of being sincere in
wanting ‘‘good clean fun.”

You know, drink a little, not
smoke that evil weed. bring
her back intact with just
anybody! Well think of all the
better nots. Just think of all the
diseases he could get. And ,oh-
heaven forbid— transmit!

Any male who's still a ‘‘vir
gin’ in college is rather anomal-
ous anyway. Dses he know what
to do? Girls read books. How
many males do you actually

know who've read The Sensuous
Man? And, of course, there is
always the question of a girl's
virginity.

Sophomores say: *‘Don't your
freshman year. or you'll regret
it." This scares the hell out of
girls who are asked” later and
of course those who have al-
ready partaken of the forbidden
fruit.

Again 1 congratulate you for
insight and truthful interpreta
tion of how some girls get after
four weeks of blind
herny, not eager.

Librans like good food, good clothes, good music. And that kind of good

Nobody makes malt liquor like Schlitz. Nobody.
