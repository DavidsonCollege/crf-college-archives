Picture Postcard,

16 July, 1975

Caro,

The docks clatter,

Sunstruck gesso

Shines as

Ponza wakes to port its morning
Hydrofoil of

Rainbowed hips that silkly
Swing past rigs of bleach-sailed
Smacks and colliers churning to
Nettuno. Deck

Chairs brim with

Ripened flanks, fallow wives

Obscured ‘by 'awning-tinted glare in which
Three fishers stand who

Speak of swimmer’s dawn.
