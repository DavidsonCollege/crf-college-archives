Screen Scene

Saucy film:
the pet
detective

By Scott McLean

Well folks, after a brief hiatus
I am back with the latest on what’s
hot and what’s not in the entertain-
ment world.

Having tackled more serious
films in my last couple of reviews,
I opted this week to handle a light-
hearted fluff film instead, this time
in the guise of Ace Ventura, Pet
Detective. What canI say? I guess
I was feeling a little saucy this
week. Anyway, I knew that if I
saw one more movie with a mes-
sage, I would sneeze an Oscar
myself; besides, even fluff de-
serves its day in the sun every once
in a while.

Jim Carrey, who brought to
life such memorable characters as
the artificially enhanced body-
builder Vera de Milo and the psy-
chotic safety inspector Fire
Marshall Bill on the series Jn Liv-
ing Color, again works his magic
in the title role of this mindless
flick. As a professional pet inves-
tigator, Ace prowls the streets of
Miami in search of missing Spots
and Fluffys until he finally gets the
big casehe’s been waiting for. The-
mission: Find Snowflake, the kid-
napped Miami Dolphins’ mascot.
Thrown in the mix are the standard
supporting characters: the love
interest (Courtney Cox), the best
friend (Tone Loc), and the para-
noid, permanently PMSing police
sergeant who is perpetually pissed
at Ace’s interference with police
protocol (Sean Young) - now say
that five times really fast.

As you’ve probably
guessed, this movie is silly and
stupid with almost no redeeming
qualities whatsoever, and I loved
every minute of it. Not that I adore
every piece of inane cinema I see,
but this film had that special some-
thing, a certain je ne sais quoi, that
set it apart from the others in the
same category: it had Jim Carrey.
This witty contortioning comedian
is a riot and had me rolling in the
aisles; of course, I’m a sucker for
silly gags. Apparently, this kind of
reaction to the film has been occur-
ring all over the country, much to
the dismay of critics everywhere,
as the movie has enjoyed enor-
mous success. While this isn’t
exactly the kind of feel-good movie
of the year the country has been
waiting for, it is a pretty good way
to spend an hour anda half. So, go
with a friend or a loved one, share
some popcorn and a Coke, and
you'll find yourself chucking at
the flick in spite of every effort to
restrain yourself.

That’s all for this week, folks!
Stay tuned as next week there will
be a very special edition of Screen
Scene in which I will make my
picks for this year’s Academy
Awards. Until then, y’all have a
great week and as always, I’ll see

Before T.V. there was poetry,
and it was more entertaining.

Poet David Slavitt reads from his work on Thursday.

By Shayna Chazin

Before television, before video games,
there was poetry to occupy those lazy hours
after dinner and before bed.

On Thursday night, David R. Slavitt, an
eminent poet, novelist and translator, came to
Davidson to read some of his work. With his
surprisingly gregarious and refreshing
personality he proved himself to be one who
sees the lighter side of poetic art.

His menu of poetry ranged from delight-
fully tragic works (including a poem called
“An Extremely Short History of China,”
which shouted lines like: “suffering suffering
pain more suffering extremely harsh suffer-
ing famine suffering...”) to “sappy grandpa
poems,” as he liked to call them, to some
highly intuitive pieces that scraped gently at
the relationships of humans with the Divine
(“The Two Peters”).

To say the least, Slavitt captured his
audience from beginning to end. Though at
times his remarks sounded a little callous: “I
married a doctor, so I have a hobby [poetry].
Feminism made it okay for me to say this.

you at the movies!

And I love it.” However, his presence was so

captivating that these quips slipped by with
little notice.

Slavitt performed a few pieces from his
recent book, Avianus, which is a translation
of a minor poet's work from the late fourth
and early fifth centuries. Just as he described
them, the poems from this selection were
“very hand-on-hip,” such that they seemed
like Aesop’s fables with a twist (of lime).

By far the best, however, was his last
piece from his newest book, The Metamor-
Phosis of Ovid, in which he passionately
recounts the tale of a young daughter in love
with her father. The verse was so rich and
well-formed that by the time he stopped he
had his audience attached to every word. He
did not reveal the end, saying laconically,
“Now you have to buy the book.”

Slavitt has written fifty books—over
fourteen of which are poetry, ten of which
are translations, in addition to works of
fiction written under the pseudonym Henry
Sutton.

Slavitt has also published several non-
fiction books, performance pieces, screen-
plays, and editorials.
