Skiing:

If the post-holiday houpla has left
you feeling flat, Valentine’s Day por-
tends few knocker-downers on your
dorm door, and the winter-time blues at
Davidson makes suicide a viable alterna-
tive to flunking exams, cheer up. Street
hockey isn’t the only option for outdoor
sport enthusiasts — or even for library

grinders with their paled faces and arm
loads of books.

Pack some people into any available
car and cruise down I-77 past Statesville.
(No, not to go bowling — although that,
too, can be fun with the proper ratio of al-
cohol to blood cells swimming happily
around in the body’s stream.) Keep
cruising and flash your right-side blin-
kers at the Elkin exit. Kick it out onto

Indoor Track Prepares
Team For N ew Season

By DWAYNE D. WRIGHT

There was a time when the track sea-
son did not start until the flowers began
blooming. Then, to the delight of track
coaches all around the world, someone
invented indoor track. Davidson track
coach Gwen Harris is making good use
of the indoor season to prepare her team
for the upcoming outdoor season.

“T look at indoor as preparation for
outdoor,” Harris said. “A lot of the in-
door races will help get us ready for run-
ning outdoor events.”

According to Harris, last Saturday's
indoor meet at Virginia Tech. served as a
way for the team to get its feet wet. It was
a preparation meet for all the teams that
competed because no score was kept.
Harris said it showed the team members
that they can be competitive, and in the

process, it made them realize the type of
hard work that it will take to be sucgess-

* Harvs is very enthusiastic and op-
timistic about this year’s team, which is
comprised of 30 men and eight women.
“I am hoping that we do well in the
Southern Conference meet, and I want
to do well in home meets. I think we will
do better this year, we need to show
people that we can do well because we
are a good team,” she said.

Although the recent bad weather has
hindered team workouts, Harris's phil-
sophy is to bring the team along slowly.
“I like progressive things, they'll start
out running a certain time but by outdoor
there will be less work but more quality,”

Harris thinks the next two meets will
be the most important for the team. She
views the meet tomorrow at Lynchburg,
Va., as “a good meet for the men. Some
of the teams are better than we are but
most of them are in our class. The guys
are very optimistic about their chances.”

s, she cries, she feels angry,
she feels lonely, she feels guilty,
she makes breakfast, she makes love,
she makes do, she fs strong, she is weak,
she is brave, she is scared, she is...

Highway 421 past North Wilkesboro to-
ward Boone. Boone is where it all begins
— the skiing that is.

Once in this thriving little burg of a
metropolis, turn left somewhere, I forget
exactly, 421 Business perhaps, go down
the hill and through the intersection past
Wendy’s — a must post-trip pit stop.
Follow the signs from there.

A bunch of minor resorts, and their
bogus billboard advertisements, will ac-
cost the unwary road warrior, but these
trifling temptations should be quickly
passed by. Actually I don’t recall ever
seeing skiers at Hounds Ear and other
off-beat slopes anyway: it must be the
lower altitudes. Sights should be set on
one of the big three, either Sugar Moun-
tain, Ski Beech, or Hawks’ Nest — for-
merly called Seven Devils.

These slopes, and other inferior im-
itations, are less than a leisurely two-to-
three hour ramble away from Davidson.
ETA’s, of course, vary depending on the
condition and speed of the BMW or VW.
The route offers sudden, though not quite
breath-taking variations in scenery and
climate. For day-trippers I’d recommend
a 7 a.m. take-off to ensure maximum
snow-balling time for the money.

Local Booners and other ski-buffs
seem to agree that Sugar and Beech offer
the best of all skiing — lots of different
runs for all levels of skiers from the first-
time beginner to the supposed expert.
They warn, however, that it’s best to ski
these two places early in the week. After
Thursday there are more people to ski
upon than packed powder surfaces, and
profit-minded owners jack-up the prices
to wicked weekend rates.

Speaking of rates, Sugar and Beech

A Sure Cure For Mid-Winter Blahs

ask steep prices for skiing their steep
downhill runs. Lift tickets for the 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekday snow-cutter cost
about $18. For the not-so-brave class-
cutter intent on hollering his or her name
at the 8 or 9 a.m. roll-call, Beech offers a
12:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. package deal for
around $14.

The best by for students toting valid
I. D. cards is to ski at Hawks’ Nest — $6
for a day or night ticket. Spendthrifts
who do not own or borrow ski equipment
should consider renting skis, boots, and
poles in down-the-mountain shops and
not at the higher priced rip-off counters
of the resorts. Food can be another costly
commodity while mountain-top hop-
ping. A bag lunch or dinner helps with
the cash-flow. A tin of sardines or an-
chovies sometimes proves edible if
you're hungry enough, but don’t expect
to be the hit of the cafeteria with such low
budget fair.

Whether day-skiing or night-skiing,
the great get-away is there for the taking.
The ski-bunnies and suave ski-patrollers
are there too, around the clock. There’s
plenty of company and action for the be-
ginner, novice, no-good few-timer, in-
termediate, and skilled. Fill up the flask,
point the skiis downhill, get in the Jean-
Claude Killy tuck, and bust it down the
mountain. And if you're worried about
turning, especially to avoid other non-
moving or speeding objects, don’t. You
can either fall down and slide to a slip-
pery stop or you can step out of the way.
But be careful about performing the latter
maneuver. You're feet are probably at
least five meters long, and if you cross
your skiis, look out for the “face-plant”
blues.
