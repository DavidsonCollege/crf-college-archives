The War Between Left and Right

the Big Thing on College Campused

It may be fading as fast as the
memories of the 1980 elections off cam-
pus, but the on-campus debate over the
political role of the right has recently es-
calated into something of a lecture war
between left and right.

On the left are former U.S. senators
George M‘Govern and Birch Bayh,
who have mounted a vigorous, almost
frenetically-paced anti-rightist campus
lecture campaign.

On the right are conservatives like
writers William Rusher and Howard
Phillips and Moral Majority spokesman
Cal Thomas, who have taken to the
campus hustings to defend themselves
against the M°Govern-Bayh campaign.

The M‘Govern-Bayh campaign has
been on a broad offensive from coast to
coast this school year.

M‘Govern spent the fal] hustling from
Ferrum Junior College in Virginia to the

University of Missouri, to Purdue, Cal:

State-Fullerton, Alabama, Smith, Stan-
ford, Eckerd College in Florida, and 42
other campuses.

Among the 25 colleges he’s visited
just since January are Ohio Northern,
Louisiana State, Central Michigan and
the University of California-Santa
Cruz.

Bayh, whose schedule is less hectic

than M°Govern’s, mixes debates with
conservatives among his lectures
against right-wing politics.

Their efforts spring from M°Govern’s |

promise, made the evening after his No-
vember, 1980 senatorial defeat, to form
a liberal group to try to counter the con-
servatives’ advertising.

The result was a group called “Amer-
icans for Common Sense (ACS). -

“The lecture series is simply part of
our public relations effort, designed to
cast some doubt on the views espoused
by the Moral Majority,” explains Ruth
Claveloux, ACS’s research director.

At Notre Dame recently, for example,
McGovern charged conservatives with
“distorting the family image, trying to
judge complex issues with simple
answers and detracting from the real
issues the country should concentrate
on.”

In response, the Moral Majority has
launched its own tour to show students
“we don’t measure up to the stereo-
types,” says Cal Thomas, the group’s
vice president of communications.

“We have as much right to be doing it
as our liberal friends,” Thomas reasons.

“I’ve spoken at 40 or so colleges in the

last year across the country.”
His schedule, in fact, rivals the inten-

sity of M°Govern’s. The articulate Tho-
mas already has 25 campus stops sched-
uled through June, 1982.

But unlike M°Govern, Thomas pref-
ers to debate instead of lecture. He fre-
quently must be content with debating
ACS Executive Director George Cun-
ningham, though he did recently get to
debate Bayh at the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Thomas complains he can’t lure
M‘Govern into a joint appearance.
‘“M‘Govern just won't debate. It’s like
teaching boxing, but not getting into the
ring with somebody. The liberals go out
and lecture and make all these charges.
But there’s nobody there to challenge
them.”

Thomas, however, often serves as
surrogate debater for Moral Majority

’ President Jerry Falwell.

Students seem to like the lecture war,
regardless of who stands in for whom.

“It’s a hot issue right now,” observes
Walter Capps, a professor who arranged
one of the skirmishes at the University
of California-Santa Barbara.

As has had to happen at many cam-
puses, Santa Barbara students had to
settle for a deiayed exchange, with
M‘Govern lecturing one week and Tho-
mas the next.

Yet when Bayh and Thomas appeared
together at Pittsburgh, “the audience
really responded well,” reports Liz Bar-
nett, Pitt’s lecture organizer.

“There were some very fiery audience
reactions. It was definitely anti-Moral
Majority. Some guy kept yelling at Tho-
mas and accusing him of being a Nazi.
But Thomas really spoke his point
well,”

A sell-out crowd of 1100 attended.

Thomas is used to the response. A
Smith College audience, for one, re-
peatedly forced him to. interrupt his
speech because of heckling.

““T’m always received with great inter-

st,” he says. “There are some who
agree with me, many who remain silent,
and some who feel they must boo and
hiss and try to drown you out. It’s al-
ways an interesting demonstration of
the First Amendment they’re (the
hecklers) supoosed to believe in .”

It is also lucrative. Cunningham and
Thomas average $1800 — 2000 per ap-
pearance, while Bayh commands $2500
and M cGovern $4000 — 8000 for a lec-
ture.

Former President Gerry Ford, by con-
trast, signed for $16,000 to make and
April appearance at Auburn.
