Record turnout votes for All- Stars

By BAD BERNARD
and
HOGMAN
Staff Writers

It has.been a busy week at old
D.C. The last time we checked
in the Union there were three
different speakers discussing
two different things in four
different rooms. Bernie and
Hogman really enjoyed all of
the festivities, but would like to
ask one question. Why is it that
we go term after term with no
interesting guest lecturers and
then when we decide to have
one, we confuse the program by
inviting more than one person
at a time? In light of this, we
would like to present our
“Thoughtful Planning and Or-
ganization”” Award to all the
people who made these pro-
grams possible.

We have just finished tabula-
ting the votes for the 1978
All-IMAC Softball team, and
the results were very close. We
would like to thank all of you
that stopped by the 7-11, the
post office, the M&M Soda
Shop and took the time to fill
out a ballot. This was the
largest number of people we
ever had vote in an All-IMAC
contest —the number was close
to 800 people. Once again
thanks, and without further
adieu, here is the Bad Bernard
and Hogman ‘‘Dream Team.”

Gridders edged out

By KEVIN ROBBINS
Club Sports Correspondent

The Club Sports front has
been rather bleak for awhile,
almost as dreary as the skies
have been all week. The Club
representatives have been driv-
ing Sterling Martin crazy with
their budget proposals for next
year; poor Sterling thought he
was going to be able to catch his
breath after the Davidson Re-
lays were over. Anyway, we did
manage to squeeze in a few
games and newsy happenings
over the past couple of weeks.

The only active Club over the
weekend was the Footballers
(American-style, you Rusk
scholars). Rosenberg’s rippers
dropped a tough, tough 2-point
decision to Western Carolina on
Sunday, yielding the go- -ahead
touchdown with four minutes to

Fleet and Stuff

We consider this our finest
team ever and wish all the boys
the best. of luck. Each member
of the team will receive theg
traditional BB&H plaque and
sew-on arm patch. The team
will travel through Europe this
summer while competing in the
World IMAC Games.

There is a small controversy
surrounding our 1978 All-
IMAC team and we would like
to go ahead and air the issue, in
order that Bernie and Hogman
will be accused of no wrong
doing. There was one player
who received more votes than
any other player, but we had to
exclude him from the team on a
technicality. The player was
Bill McKinley for MacF leet and
Stuff, and when we checked his
handwriting and the 427 votes
he received, they matched in
every case. Nevertheless, Bill,
it was a good try and a
determined effort—but we said
that each person could only vote
once.

Our top ten saw some major
changes this week as our num-
ber one team from last we@k fell
prey to the lads that ask,
“What it is?”, 10-8. We inter-
viewed ace shortstop Dave Va-
ughan after the game. ‘Well,
Bernie, we just pretty much
played like #### and I guess
that’s why we lost.’’ Another
crucial factor was that Presto’s
had less runs.

Our new number one team,
Dartus Tunic and the Big 13,
waltzed its way into the top
spot by annihilating Charlie’s
Angels, 21-2. MacFleet and
Stuff stepped up to number two
by having Simple Dreams, 12-1.
John Ratliff played exceptional-
ly poorly in that game. Some-
body please tell these guys that
painter’s hats are goofy.

In another big game, Big. T

and the Oxytocins circumcised

the Four Skins, 13-8. Graeme
Thompson noted after the

game, “&'2t#*’’ The Old Men,

play. The loss dropped their
final record to a fine 2-1 recorc.

Both the Ruggers and the
Booters were idle this week. The
Rugby Club is getting geared
up for a big match this Satur-
day with the Crarlotte Gar-
goyles. ‘all te sure to come at
2 pm for tne game unless you
want tu wait for the party
afterwards. The Soccer Club
miserably pondered their home
field loss, cancelled another
game with Asheville due to
traveling inconveniences, and
then sent their hard-working
President to Wake Forest to
work on some devel*pments

taking advantige of the fact
that Dave Shi was absent,

extended the Longest Yard,

11-1 in five innings. Bobbie
Avinger was particularily jubi-
_ lant after the victory. ‘I knew if
> our assets exceeded our liabili-
ie we could win.'’ We also
talked with the youngster of the
Old Men, Sweet Billy Hutch-
ings, after the game. ‘‘We are
really playing great now, and
nothing can stop us, unless we

lose in the tournament.
“Thanks Billy.”
.%

In other games of interest,
the Lizard Kickers are trying to
protest their way by the Bongs.
Their basic argument as es-
poused by Jim Wood is,
‘Cheaters never win.’ We beg
to disagree because it appears
that the Bongs won the game,
9-4. Go Bongs!

We noted last week that our
big news was that the SAE’s
were jumping from being non-
ranked to our number five spot.
Well this week’s news is that
they are jumping back down. It
seems that the E-Baggers can’t

Zurbruegg stars

stand pressure and when pre-
sented the opportunity to move
up, they choked.

Bill Barnett captured our
feelings with this comment. ‘‘I
stepped up to bat, and all of a
sudden I felt this apple in my
throat. My knees started shak-
ing and vision became blurred.
The next thing I knew I had
whiffed at three straight pit-
ches.’’ Sorry Bill, better not
choke ‘next time and they
didn’t. Against the Pikes Once
the E-Baggers reached down for
four runs in the last inning to
win, 12-11 and erase their
stereotype of the big chokers.

We still haven't gotten any
scores for any girls games but
we have heard that a few have
been played.

The Volleyball scene is shap-
ing up and the big news is that
the Magical Mystery Tour de-
feated Slaoul last week. We
believe we can now offer our
readers our first volleyball top
ten in the history of IMAC. But
first a few words about our
number one team. For some
strange reason this team has a

player who thinks he is Wilt
Chamberlain. He .probably has
a right to think so. The player is
Louis Ortmayer and his prob-
lem is that he has a 35 inch
vertical jump. He cannot be
satisfied until he has maimed
his opponents by placing ®
volleyball between their eyes.

Cats hope to break slump

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer

When last year’s baseball
season ended, Coach Palmer
Muench knew that he needed to
get a freshman shortstop who
could knit the Wildcat infield
together. During early season
practice this year, the position
was contended for by two very
capable freshmen: John Porter
and Cam Zurbruegg.

In the early part of this
season, both freshmen shared
the position interchangeably
from week to week until two
weeks ago when Porter suffered
a hand injury. Since then
Zurbruegg has moved into the
position permanently and he
has given the Cat infield the
defensive play that is needed at
the shortstop position.

Zurbruegg comes to David-

son from BinghamtonyeN .¥/

where he played third base
throughout his high school
years. Learning of the Cats’
need for a shortstop, he worked
hard throughout this fall and
winter to ‘‘smooth out’’ the
rough spots in his transition.

This diligence has payed off °

as evidenced by this week’s
doubleheader against Furman.
The Cat defense, anchored by
Zurbrueggs’s shortstop play,
made only one error in the two
seven-inning games.

In addition to his impeccable
defensive play, Zurbruegg’s
slugging has strengthened the
Cats’ hitting attack. He touts a
.280 batting average at present
(an average which stayed over
.300 for_most of the season).

However, Zurbruegg’s batting
average hardly reflects his ef-
fectiveness at the plate.

Since he has struck out only

twice in the entire seasorf, he-

consistently puts the ball into

play, which ‘‘makes things hap-
‘pen”’ for the Cats. This week
against Furman and against
Lenoir-Rhyne, Zurbruegg hit

‘shis first two home runs of his:

“college career.
__ Joining Zyrbruegg this week

in the slugging department for
the Cats are Stan Brown and
Tim Goodell. Brown smashed
two long homeruns in the
Furman double header, moving
his season total to six. Goodell
also slugged a homerun against
Furman, giving him five for the
season.

Despite the strong hitting of
Zurbruegg, Brown and Goodell
against Furman, the Cats were
downed in the Conference dou-
ble header. These losses to
Furman move the Cats’ Confer-
ence record to 3-5, which mini-
mizes any chance they had of
winning the Southern Confer-
ence. The Cats are 12-20 overall
and have twelve games left in
the season, so they still may
finish the season with a respec-
table record.

Since Zurbruegg is only a
freshman, the Cats can look to
