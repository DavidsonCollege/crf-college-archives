Davidson rugby overcame a
long road trip, a hostile crowd, and
a lack of substitutes to trounce
Western Carolina, 34-3 on Sanit:
day ‘in Cullowhee.

Rugby

President Thayer Long said,
“We had to overcome a lot of ad-
versity this weekend. I am real

proud of all these guys because |

they refused to be cowed by
Western’s dirty tactics.”

The game started out evenly,
both teams unable to penetrate deep
into opponent territory. Davidson
drew first blood on a Matt
Burkhardt penalty kick. Davey
Bacon used a ball fake to break
into the open and beat the defense

down the field for five points, add-
ing to the Davidson lead.

The Davidson backs em-
ployed quick passes, solid running,
and a Hank Ackerman try at the
end of the period, giving Davidson
a 15-0 halftime lead. :

The Wildcats showed supe-
rior conditioning and talent, re-
peatedly beating the Catamounts
to loose balls.

“We won the game because

we were all still running around

tackling and rucking while half of

their team was standing around

gasping for air,” Ackerman said.
After an injury to Scott

Burkhardt,
Standout; was enlisted as a Wild-
cat. He immediately proved his
mettle with an outstanding run over
and through several Western play-
ers for a try.

Holding the momentum,
Davidson added David Derrick and
Long tries.

The team is ecstatic over their
sparkling 3-0 record, but disap-
pointed with the turnout for this
game.

Said Craig Murphy, “I wish
we had had our whole team here so
we could have beaten those guys
100-0.”

Team doesn’t panic
disappointing week

: By CLayTONn SCHLOSS

The Davidson baseball team
endured a disappointing string of
losses last week, losing all four of
their games.

The Wildcats lost to the UNC-
‘ Greensboro Spartans last Wednes-
day 5-4 and were swept this week-
end in three games against the
Appalachian State Mountaineers
by scores of 16-7, 9-3, and 6-0.

Baseball

The Wildcats suffered a 12
inning heartbreaker last Wednes-
day in Greensboro, 5-4. Chris
Pollard started on the mound for
Davidson, and Jonathan Coulombe
pitched well in relief, allowing only
one earned run. Second baseman
T.J. Plummer led the way for the
Wildcats on offense, going three
for five on the day, and catcher
Dominick Talvacchio knocked in
two runs.

“There were two teams out
there who foughthard and deserved
to win, but we came out of it with
a frustrating loss. We played tough
and hung with them, but it wasn’t

enough, ” said Plummer.

“We played twelve innings of
good, hard baseball today, but we
just couldn’t pull it out,” added
pitcher Mordecai Stolk.

Davidson hosted a double-
header at Wildcat Park against
Appalachian State last Saturday,
and their fortunes did not change.
The Mountaineers dominated
Davidson 16-7 in the opener, and
they broke open a close game to
take the nightcap 9-3.

The Wildcats never seemed to
get on track in the first game, as
Appalachian State lit up
Davidson’s pitching staff for 17
hits and 10 walks en route to an
easy victory. Mordecai Stolk
started the game for the Wildcats,

‘ but he blew out his arm and could

not continue past the second in-
ning.

Right fielder Gus Quattlebaum
was the lone bright spot for
Davidson, blasting solo and three-
run homers and collecting four
RBI's. |

“We didn’t come out men-
tally ready to play. We made fun-
damental mistakes on defense that
cost us,” said Quattlebaum.

Davidson took an early 2-1
lead in the second game on third

after
of losses

baseman Anderson Marvin’s solo
homer, but Appalachian State came
back to win. Chris Pollard, who
started on the hill for the Wildcats
suffered his first loss of the season.
Chris Rodriguez of Appalachian
State had a huge day, going eight
for ten with a home run and five
RBI’s.

“The two games on Saturday
were really: exciting. I was a little
disappointed at the outcome, but
this team has a lot of potential and
they’ ll get better over time,” said
Bo Craig, who eagerly attended
both Saturday games along with

- 247 other fans.

Appalachian State completed
the sweep of Davidson Sunday,
winning comfortably 6-0. The
Wildcats were held to only two
hits, as starting pitcher Jonathan
Coulombe picked up the loss. The
most costly blow was a grand slam
by Appalachian State’s Scott
Garrett.

However, the team is not pan-
icked. They feel there is plenty of
time to improve on their 1-6 record.
During Spring Break, the Wildcats
have big matchups against Duke
and Wake Forest, and they face an
always talented Citadel team the
week we return.

Run!
from page 14

mother and professor says that she
wants to run one more, but she is
unsure where and when she wants
to do it. She is looking for an
unusual race, preferably in the fall,
but the possibility of racing in
Chicago where she ran her first
10k is tempting.

Roberts is now a race director

too. She has planned a competi-
tive run, to be held on May 4,
called the Davidson Town Day Sk.
It will be part of the festivities of
Town Day ‘96, which will be cen-
tered on the town green in front of
the new Public Library. Proceeds
from the race will be donated to the
Davidson/Cornelius Daycare Cen-
ter.

“A 5k is a good distance for
people who have never run a race
before. For more serious runners,

itis a distance where you can push
yourself unlike a 10k where you
have to conserve,” Dr. Roberts
explained. ‘There will also be
surprises along the course.” She
said that she is considering several
interesting loops through
Davidson. She will also be selling
Town Day 5k T-shirts.

Roberts hopes to make this an
annual event, and encourages
Davidson College students to par-
ticipate.

Wildcats to host

The Davidson women’s bas-
ketball team had mixed results
this week, beating Tennessee-Chat-
tanooga, 79-74, Monday and East
Tennessee St., Thursday, 75-66,
before falling to Marshall, 85-69,
Saturday in Belk Arena.

Women’s

Basketball

Thursday’s winclinched home
court advantage for Davidson in
the first round of the Southern
Conference tournament on
Wednesday.

Saturday, the Wildcats played
the Thundering Herd close early,
trailing by just two at the half. But
Marshall came out firing in the
second half, continually nailing
three pointers that eventually wore
the Wildcats down.

“The three pointer is their
(Marshall’s) only offense, and
when they hit the three, they are
very tough to beat,” Carolyn Kirsch
said.

Jessica Montrella, who scored
12 for the Wildcats, also credits
Marshall’s rebounding.

“Tn the second half, they were
effective on the offensive boards
and were able to get a lot of easy

~ points with put-backs,” she said.

Added coach John Filar, “We
got a little tired on defense. We
‘had four games in eight days (go-
ing into Saturday). I knew, sooner
or later, the legs were gonna catch
up to us. It was dissapointing.”

Kristina. Behnfeldt led
Marshall with a career high 25
points and 14 rebounds, while
Ferrucci tallied 18 for the Wild-
cats.

Saturday’s contest represented
the last regular season game at
Belk for seniors Kristen Ferrucci,
Maggie Young, Tonya Sharpe, and
Molly Burke who were honored in
a pre-game ceremony.

As the first recruited class af-
ter the reinstatement of the
women’s basketball program -at
Davidson in 1992-93, the quartet
has resurrected the Wildcats from
recent doldrums to where they cur-
rently stand, aneven .500 in league
play and ready to host postseason
action for the first time ever.

“We took the approach when
we had to build this program from
scratch to build it around not just
quality players, but quality people,”
Filar explained, “That’s what these
four have meant. These four have
been such great role models.
They’ ve given so much to this pro-
gram. They’re four of the best
young ladies I've ever coached.
They really are.”

“Obviously we’ ve had some
disappointing losses this season,
but we’re putting all of that away
to focus on Wednesday,” Montrella
said.

“Last year any time we took
the court, we were never the favor-
ite,” said Filar, “This year, we
turned the tables completely and
we expect to win. That’s a big step
to take in one year.”

And the next step is a victory
Wednesday night... ,

“One of our goals was to host
atournament game. We’ ve played
so well at home,” added Filar, ‘The
student body has now really started
to buy into this team. We need the
student body to turn out in mass on
Wednesday night. These kids need
a big send-off, whether they win or
lose, they need to hear some bigtime
noise at the end of the game.”
Gametime is 7 p.m.

Conference
tourney looms

By JouN Rog

Davidson finished their dual
meet season Tuesday night by top-
ping Longwood, 32-15, and fall-
ing to a skilled App. St. team, 40-
9.

Wrestling

The grapplers experienced ups
and downs throughout this year’s
campaign, but according to coach
Tom Oddo, the team finished ex-
tremely well.

“I was very pleased by the
way we came back and fought in
all of the matches. These two
matches were a good close to a
successful dual meet season,” said
Oddo.

The Wildcats avenged an ear-
lier loss to Longwood, taking ev-
ery weightclass except 118. Fresh-
man Christian Baker (134) got the
team rolling by defeating his op-
ponent, 10 - 4.

Baker pieced together two

takedowns and two nearfalls in the
first period to take a commanding
9 - 1 advantage on his way to the:
easy victory.

George Escaravage outlasted
Ivan Cruz, 5 - 3. 150-pounder
Sean Harvey and his opponent were
both disqualified just nine seconds
into the first round of their bout.

The Wildcats continued to
dominate, as Miller Cary and Seth
Herman, both wrestling up a weight
class, prevailed 9 - 4 and 9 - 7,
respectively. Ben Wall increased
his conference leading pin total to
nine, upping his team-leading
record to 19 - 9. Chip Stewart
posted a 1-0 triumph, his only point
coming from a second period es-
cape.

Although the Wildcats
wrestled well versus the Moun-
taineers, App. St. ultimately proved
too strong. After giving up the first
takedown and reversal, Baker
battled back in the third period to
overcome Hariston, 9-4.

Only the conference tourna-
ment in Greensboro, starting Sat-
urday, remains for the Wildcats.
