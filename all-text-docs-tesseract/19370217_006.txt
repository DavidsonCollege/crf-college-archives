Troop Has New Hut

The Davidson Scout Troop is
equipped with a new Scout hut on
the high school grounds. Several
years ago the boys were using the
old Louisiana building which was
across the road from Shearer Hall,
but when the college decided to
tear down that building, the boys
were left with no‘place to meet.
Under Sam Nickeys leadership at
the time, they had acquired a num-
ber of tools for a workshop, and
the boys had become very much
interested in the work. So the Y.
M. C. A. through its man on the
cabinet in charge of boys’ work be-
gan to plan for a_ regular
shack. Ed Hodge, of the Class of
35, drew plans for a hut, and made

“The Davidson College Cen-
tennial” Is Sent To Alumni
And Friends

“The Davidson College Centen-
nial,” a short manuscript compiled
by Dr. Walter Lingle, was printed
last month and is now being dis-
tributed among the alumni and
friends of the college all over the
world.. The pamphlet is a reprint
from the recent Union Seminary
Review in which it was first pub-
lished,

“The Davidson College Centen-
nial” is a brief sketch of the his-
Davidson which also in-
cludes certain outstanding facts
about the present status of the col-
lege and some of the hopes and
possibilities of the future.

Dr. Lingle has written a very in-
teresting early history of Davidson,
Among the incidents described is
the ancient tradition which sur-
rounds the origin of the Davidson
motto and seal. It is believed by
many that Peter Stuart Ney, whom
several authorities have affirmed to
be the famous Marshal Ney of Na-
poleon’s army, wrote the motto and
sketched the seal one day during
the recess of a small country school
with which he was connected.
The definite history of the fotind-
ing of the school began with the
resolutions drawn up by the Con-
cord Presbytery and finally real-
ized when a little school was open-
ed in March, 1837, with 65 stu-
dents and three professors. From
that year until 1855 Davidson Col-
lege enéduntered many severe sit-
uations and suddenly, when the
college was engaged in what seetn-
ed to be the throes of death, came
the enriching two hundred thou-
sand dollar legacy of Maxwell
Chambers. The War Between the
States almost wiped out this source
of income and for years Davidson
carried on another fight for fin-
ances. The college suffered a tra-
gic blow when Old Chambers was
destroyed in 1921,

Musical Group
Receives Pfohl

Professor Pfohl Elected to the
American Band-Master
Association

PASSES SET OF EXAMS

J. C. Harper Is Only Other
Member In South

Professor James C. Pfohl has
been elected to membership in the
American Bandmaster Association.

This association was formed in

1928 and at the present time has a
membership of about seventy mu-
sicians in the United States, Can-
ada, and England. Only three mem-
bers were taken in during the past
year—they being Mr. Prescott, the
director of the University of Min-
nesota, band; Carleton Stewart, the
director of the National Champion
High School Band of Mason City,
Iowa; and Prof. Pfohl, the director
of the Davidson Band. After being
elected to membership, one must
pass a set of four three hour ex-
aminations on musical history, form
analysis, theory and harmony, and
band arrangements.
Prof. Pfohl was elected last Au-
gust, and took his examinations
during December. He was notified
last week of his acceptance. There
has been only one other member
in the association from Maryland
to Florida, and that is Captain
James C. Harper of Lenoir, who is
a Davidson alumnus and a trustee
of the college at the present time.
The late John Phillip Sousa was
honorary life president of the asso-
ciation, and Edwin Franko Gold-
man is at present an honorary life
president. The active president is
Frank Simon, the conductor of the
Armco Band of Cincinnati.

A prof was trying to quieten his
class. “I won’t go on with my lec-
ture until the room settles down,”
he rapped. “Better go home and
sleep it off, old man!” replied an
experienced student.

DAVIDSON BELL HS
INTERESTING STORY

Presented By F. B. McDowell,
Honoring Davidson’s World
War Dead

An important element in the lives
of all Davidson students is the
school bell which is heard so often
during the course of each day of the
school term. On the average school
day the bell is rung at least twelve
times at regular intervals to sum-
mon the students to classes, meals,
and etc., and thanks to the excel-
lent service of the janitors who
ring it the accuracy of the time of
its ringing can be relied upon.

The bell has been in use at Dav-
idson for fifteen years, having been
installed on top of a tower behind
the old gymnasium when it was
brought here in 1922. It remained
on the tower only for a short time,
and was then placed in its present
position on top of Chambers Build-
ing near east corner of the dome.

In regard to the bell itself it is
interesting to note that it was cast
in Troy, N. Y., by the Meneely Bell
Company at a cost of approximately
$1,800. The weight is 1,500 pounds,
and it is in the key of G.

The bell was donated to the col-
lege by the Honorable F. Brevard
McDowell, who was a graduate of
Davidson and a member of the class
of 1869. The gift was made as a
memorial to the former Davidson
students who were killed in the
World War. These facts are
brought out in the etching on the

side of the bell which reads as
follows:
1922
Presented to Davidson College
by

Honorable F. Brevard McDowell
of the class of 1869
In memory of our soldier dead
“To you from falling hands we
throw
The torch;—be yours to hold it

high.”

Riflemen Will
Fire in Match

Team Will Compete in Annual
War Department Corps
Area Match

During this week the college
rifle team will compete in the War
Department Corps Area Match.
This is an annual affair for all col-
leges and university R. O. T. C.
units throughout the country.

The team score for this match is
made up of the ten high scores of
fifteen men firing. Each team fires
its score on its own range. The
results are then sent to the Com-
manding General of the Corps Area
in which the school is located.
These figures are verified and com-
pared with other scores in order to
determine winners.

Each. individual member of the
team must fire ten shots per posi-
tion. There are four positions. The
contestant is allowed two practice
shots for each of these.

This will be the first important
match for the team this year. In
practice the team has shown con-
siderable promise and it is hoped
that it willfinish high in the com-
ing contest.

By virtue of his sensational shoot-
ing in this game, Iverson captured
ninth place among the individual
scorers of the Southern Confer-
ence, running his total up to 84
points, close behind Hill of State
and Mullis of Carolina. Saturday
night the two teams will meet
again at Davidson and the outcome
may decide which of them will go

(A Serial Advertisement)

Richmond, Va. — Almost every
section of the Southland was rep-
resented in the record crowds that
packed Schauffler Hall at Union
Theological Seminary to hear Dr.
Herman H. Horne, Ph.D., LL.D., the
Rev. Hugh T. Kerr, D.D., LE-D.,
and the Rev. F. Crossley Morgan,
D.D., deliver the annual Sprunt
Lectures.

The addresses lasted from Jan-
uary 3lst, through Saturday, Feb-
ruary 6th. The Sprunt Lectures
take the place of class work dur-
ing the first week of the third term
each year.

Dr. Horne, the principal lecturer,
is professor of education and the
history of philosophy at New York
University and a noted writer on
theology, philosophy, and education.
A native of North Carolina, he was
educated at the University of North
Carolina, Harvard, and the Univer-
sity of Berlin. His lectures, pre-
pared over a period of years and
now published in book form, were
on “The Philosophy of Christian
Education.”

Dr. Kerr, pastor of the Shadyside
Presbyterian Church, is also a not-
ed writer on religious subjects. His
lectures were on the Christian Con-
ception of God, Man, Prayer, the
Cross, and the Church. Dr. F.
Crossley Morgan, of Augusta, Ga.,

Campbell Morgan of London, Eng-
land, spoke on “The Vision of
