Hoop
Dreams
scores

By Tammy TIsKA
Davidsonian movie critic

The Academy Award nomi-
nations were announced last
week, and most of the expected
names were mentioned — John
Travolta, Forrest Gump, Woody
Allen, Forrest Gump. But there
was one particularly glaring ab-
sence.

Not only was Hoop Dreams
slighted from the Best Picture
category, it wasn’t even nomi-
nated for Best Documentary. The
chairman of the committee that
screens the documentaries said
something like, “We watched
over five hundred documenta-
ries. And we found five that we
liked better than Hoop Dreams.”
That may be how the sys-
tem works, but the omission of
Hoop Dreams is an outrage that
‘| will go down in cinema history.
A three-hour-long. movie has
never flown by so fast. Much of
the power of this film stems from
the simple fact that it is a docu-
mentary. From the moment I
saw William Gates and Arthur
Agee playing basketball on their
neighborhood court, I was mes-
merized. This was real. It was
somebody’s life.

Of course it’s easy to forget
there is somebody behind the
camera, asking the questions, de-
ciding whatto film, what to omit,
and what to zoom inon. No film
can escape the bias and purposes
of the director as he manipulates
reality. Still, this film is refresh-
ingly free of sentimentality. No
blaring music telling me to get
emotional during the sad scenes.
No struggle to convince myself
the plot was realistic, because
there was no plot. Just life for
two boys struggling to follow
their dreams of making it out of
inner-city Chicago to the NBA.
No one dies, there are no fatal
illnesses and no unrequited loves,
yet I found myself on the verge
of tears at seemingly insignifi-
cant moments.

Hoop Dreams is surprising.
The best writers couldn’t have
worked more startling events into
the script. The film follows
Arthur and William as they are
recruited out of grammar school
to play basketball until they leave
forcollege. But Hoop Dreams is
not just about basketball; it ex-
plores the expectations of fam-
ily, the innocence of youth, and
the power to achieve dreams.

Although the film exposes
the poverty of the inner-city, it

Occasionally (I assume this
is a common experience) I read a
play before I go to see it and feel
certain that it is a disaster: the
script seems filled with cliches; it
seems reductive and simplistic,
too uninterestingly didactic. But
when I see the play my experi-
ence is entirely different. Lines
that had seemed slack and
hackneyed in the script are
brilliantly illuminated by the
actors, and the movement of the
whole play is seamlessly
orchestrated by an inspired and
keen director. My enjoyment of
the play is enhanced by my
earlier skepticism about it, as it
was when I saw Equus or Angels
in America after reading those
plays. .

Oleanna was for me an
entirely different sort of experi-
ence. I didn’t read the script
before seeing the play on the 21st
in Love Auditorium. Frankly,
I’m glad I didn’t spend the time
to do so; it’s clear enough to me

from seeing the performance that
1 would have thrown the script

aside and found some other way
to spend my evening. And if the
script itself hadn’t been bad
enough to turn me off before I
saw the play, the abysmal
production that a packed house
endured on Tuesday surely was.
Oleanna is a reprehensible
play, and the performances by
Monica Koskey and Jim
Frangione and the direction of
Scott Zigler do nothing to
salvage it. From Frangione’s
first tinny line to Koskey’s
laughable closing incantation, the
play is a study in monochrome,
as if the director had limited the

actors to one or two emotional
registers for this performance.
Whatever nuance that Mamet
hadn’t whitewashed out of the
script is drained by this perfor-
mance so that, in the end, the
whole thing sags with a depress-
ing dullness.

The play is ostensibly an
important drama about sexual
politics; in fact, it’s merely a
misogynist polemic that might
have been poignant ten years ago
but now appears as nothing other
than posturing, ranting, and dated
men’s-movement propaganda.
The female character in the ,
drama, Carol, appears in the first
scene to be an utter idiot; in the
second scene she’s a cardboard
version of every insecure male’s
nightmare. She spouts cliche
after cliche so that you feel
foolish sympathizing with her, as

you feel at first you ought to do.

For this play to be effective,
Carol should have come across
as a strong woman standing up to
injustice; instead she seems a
demented and dangerous Donna
Quixote, tilting.at a windbag.
She rotates in the three scenes of
the play from being a submis-
sive, pathetic whiner to an
apparently insane ideologue to
the powerful (but still, Mamet
would have us see clearly, quite
out of her mind) wielder of all
control at the end.

. Or almost at the end: with
only minutes to go until the final
curtain, Mamet’s play takes the
turn we’ ve been waiting for it to
take since the very beginning.
The much-put-upon professor,
John, finally blows his stack in a
1990s version of vigilante
justice. In the least believable

and most ludicrously acted scene
in the play, John (whose only
consistency has been in his
unevenness) slaps, punches, and
generally throws around poor
Carol. This is supposed to be the
grand conflagration, the scene
we’ll talk about for weeks; the
audience at this performance had
a hard time muffling its laughter.’

If David Mamet thought that
Oleanna would provide an
interesting take on the sexual
dilemma that much of America
feels itself to be in, he was
wrong.

If he thought that he would
provide a male’s point of view
on the ascension of a feminist
consciousness, he was wrong-
headed. To this male, Oleanna
and the mindset behind it are an
embarrassment.

They Might Be Giants

(In their own original way)

By JAMES BERRY
Staff writer

With the release of their fifth
album, John Henry, They Might
Be Giants have again twisted popu-
lar music to their whim. Originally
a duo, John Flansburg (vocals and
guitar) and John Linell (vocals,
accordion, keyboard, and bass sax)
have added a drummer and bassist
to their line-up, taking the place of

the drum machines and computer ~
sequencers that were formerly the -

sources of the group’s music. Also
amother new element are the horn
players which offer essential ac-
companiment on many of the new
songs. These additions are respon-
sible for the live sound that John
Henry carries throughout and, al-
though unfamiliar, it doesn’t dis-
tract from the classic TMBG style.

“Particle Man” is the only song

that people associate with the band
and so quickly dismiss them as a
dull but quirky fluke that some-
how got arecord deal. But there is
much more to their music than an
odd and somewhat pointless col-
lection of random thoughts. They
have a knack for singing intelli-
gently about mostly unintelligent
things. These boys have surpassed
cleverand have created a new level
of weird. Studying the lyrics re-
veals much more sense than a ca-
sual listening of the music. In
addition, a lot of their songs have a
mocking quality to them, and the
subjects of this mockery includé
songwriters as much as anyone
else.

They Might Be Giants’ music
has always been caught somewhere
between polka, pop, and lounge,
but don’t let that scare you. It truly
can’t be defined, and with the re-

lease of the new album, the TMBG
sound has taken on a new person-
ality. The live drums must have
inspired some jamming sessions
because, while on earlier albums
the guitar took a back seat, it’s
been moved to the front and given
the music a much heavier sound —
a perfect blend to take on the road.

Lastsummer at the Horde con-
cert, I almost fell asleep because
Blues Traveller wouldn’t stop so-
loing. At Smashing Pumpkins I
feared for my life. TMBG was just
right.

When they performed at the
Pterodactyl last Wednesday, they
attracted a much stranger crowd
than I ever would have guessed.
The Davidson contingent was (as
usual) the cleanest cut of the bunch,
even atits extreme, when the norm
was extra long hair and 17 ear-
rings. When the Dambuilders (the

opening band) finished their set,
the crowd flocked to the stage as
two clean cut, rather mousy guys
took their places.

Behind John and John were a
bassist (who later humored John F.
by playing “the wah thing”), a
drummer (whose renowned skill
with the glockenspiel was based
on sounding one note during the
song, “Shoehorn With Teeth”), and
two horn players (trumpet and
trombone).

The show started with the first
track off John Henry, “Sublimi-
nal.” By the end of the next three
songs (““A.K.A.” “Driver,” and
“Sleeping in the Flowers”) the
crowd surged with energy, sway-
ing back and forth in the early
Stages of moshing. As the per-
formers delved into their earlier
