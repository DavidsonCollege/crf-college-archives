Hail to the Chief

What the hell is going on in
D.C.? As a senior whose tour of
duty at Fort Davidson ends ina few
months, I cannot help but feel dis-
enchanted with the prospects for
this coming summer of joining the
suits in the morning commute to
Metro Center. Let me explain just
some of the reasons.

First, who does Newt Gingrich
think he is? Anyone who helps in
bringing about a federal govern-
ment shutdown because he felt
snubbed by having to sit in coach
and eat the TV dinner during the
Air Force | ride over to Israel
cannot be trusted to represent and
speak for a majority. Was anyone
else as baffled as I was about the
whole shutdown?

Second, this one slipped past

most of the Euro-centric American
public but what business is it of
ours to say that the American Em-
bassy in Tel Aviv should be moved
to Jerusalem?

strapped with a hundred pounds of
explosives.

luck). His recent chore of convinc-
ing the Congress for the need of an
American intervention in Bosnia
has come under stiff opposition
from whoelse?

Has the appeal
of Jewish votes
distracted Bob
Dole’s ratio-
nale so much
that he has for-
gotten about

ingly insignifi-
cant little Pal-

America’s bias towards one of the
three religions on the Holy Land has
given the green light for violent acts

of disapproval.

Sabotaging the
policies of
Clinton has
“become the
hobby of cer-
tain members
of the govern-
ment. Have
these “leaders”
ever heard of

estinians with
the cute headresses? America’s
bias towards one of the three reli-
gions in the Holy Land has given
the green light for violent acts of
disapproval. Don’t be surprised if

Third, I am exposing myself
to a barrage of criticism on this
one, but'l think President Clinton
has done a decent job recently
(which may be purely related to

the concept of
a hierarchy? Being president
means numero uno, el presidente,
oras acertain opinions editor would
say: El Jefe (the boss).

Perhaps my deep-seeded dis-

dain for American politics derives
from the lack of any violence or
upheaval in our government. Jo-
seph Stalin simply eliminated ev-
eryone who was a perceived threat
to him. In Iraq, the deposed
monarch’s body was dragged
through the streets of Baghdad in
1958. Atleast in Taiwan members
of the Parliament climb over chairs
and engage in some fisticuffs over
a disagreement. This is precisely
what American politics needs to
make it interesting.

The holiday season is rapidly
approaching. I can picture early
Christmas morning when Colin
Powel will be opening his presents
from Bob, Newt and Bill. Enjoy
your eggnog chief, you made the
right choice.

Ahh, senior year

As a student counting down
the days until I am thrust into the
real world and fed to the dogs, I
thought I would outline some of
the anomalies of being a senior.
Interviewing: | am definitely not
an expert on the subject, seeing as
how I’ve never been to one, nor
plan to if I can help it. However, I
do have some gripes about the on-
campus interviewing process
which everyone else is so en-
wrapped. First of all, why would I
want to work for a com-

They seem like a good idea,
though. A house invites senior
men and freshmen women — and
that, one senior friend of mine can
attest to, is a lethal combination.
Apartments: What am I going to
do next year when I don’t have
those RLO dudes coming by to see
that my place is clean twice a year
(that is of course if I get the bus boy
job I’m interviewing for, and it
pays enough to pay the rent). It
really does amaze me how fast a

latest “Hook Party” polls indicate)
they are all in love with Britt Tay-
lor and his belly. Graduation prob-
ably means less binge drinking and
therefore the last chance I have of
developing a top-notch belly of
my own.
Hooking up: This topic has always
been a source of debate on campus
so I'll say as little as possible but
probably still make some people
mad. What am I going to do next
year when I don’t have a resource
to shop for drunk, vul-

pany so desperate forem-
ployees that have to go
around recruiting them.
Come on people, have
you ever met those
Anderson Consulting
tools? Than again, a
more realistic assess-
ment of my aversion to
these interviews is that
fact the my chances of
standing out from a pool

The next person

that asks me

what I’m doing

next year...

nerable women who I
can trick into thinking
I’m suave and stun-
ningly handsome and
really only wantto bring
her back to my apart-
ment to show her my
poster of Kirk
Cameron?

For those
women who now not
only don’t want to

of a hundred or so
Davidson kids are not really good.
Also, I never ‘know when these
recruiter dorks are coming, since
the last time I listened to an entire
message from Brenda Harvey was
whenever she sent the first one
(and even then I kind of spaced out
for about five minutes in the middle
of it).

The question: The next person that
asks me what I’m doing next year...
Champagne parties: Apparently
there was one Friday night. My
friends claim that I went to it, and
judging by the headache I had when
1 woke up Saturday morning, some-
one must have clobbered me with
a bottle when I showed up.

clean (a relative term I assure you)
apartment can be transformed into
a wasteland of beer cans, unread
sections of the paper, and my
roomate's (a.k.a. Tabby the Rat)
dirty dishes. If he and his girl-
friend don’t get married so she can
keep him in line, he may be worse
off than me.

Marriage: Y mscaredeventotouch
this one, but what the hell. Too
many people my age are getting
married. Just because college ends
doesn’t mean the fun has to.

I’m sure I just wrote off any
chance of marrying a Davidson
woman with that comment, but
from what I understand (and the

marry me but also
would like to see me hung in front
of Chambers, try reading that sen-
tence again assuming a sarcastic
tone.

Well!’ msureI left outa bunch
of noteworthy senior issues, but
I’ mtrying to work on coming back
for another senior year to study
them in more depth (at least that’s
what I’m telling my parents).

But if I do graduate I'll be
thinking about my married class-
mates with high-paying (and high
stress) jobs as I relax each night in
my bachelor pad, drinking cham-
pagne from the bottle, rubbing my
belly and thinking about my easy
going job at Burger World.

I would like to begin on a side
note. For the many distrusting
students who accused me of forg-
ing the letter to the editor from Jen
Rawlings published in last week’s
Davidsonian, 1 would like to reit-
erate my innocence in the affair. I
most certainly did not forge that
letter. As the amateur journalist
that I am, I consider myself above
such blatant attempts at undermin-
ing the integrity of the paper for
self-flattery (not far above, but
above nevertheless). What is
wrong with you people? Is it so
hard to believe that someone en-
joys my articles? Actually, I
haven’t ruled out the possibility of
sarcasm in the letter, but that is
another issue. Anyway, enough
on that.

I feel I may have stepped ona
few toes in my article last week
when I attempted to condemn com-
puter nerdiness. I did not mean to
criticize people who spend large
amounts of time on computers,
especially professors of mine who
are right now. pondering final
grades. As a matter of fact, due to
the lovely workload here, I spend a
good portion of my life in front of
acomputer screen, But also real-
ize that there is more to life than
studying and computerized toys.

I think most of my bitterness
toward the realm of computers
comes from my poor, actually dis-
mal, relationship with my PC.
Recently, just before I needed to
print an important paper, my:com-

puter and printer joined forces and —

made a deal with Satan. The thing
is possessed, I tell you. Its monitor
hasn’t started spinning around or
projectile vomiting like the kid in
The Exorcist, but the thing is defi-
nitely in league with Lucifer. It
doesn’t do anything I tell it to, and
it either won’t print or does so ata

fraction of its normal speed. The °

only way I got it to print my last

paper was by making a side deal
with the printer in which I prom-
ised it my first born male child and

agreed to interface it with a sexy
Ink Jet model.

Aside from the deviousness
of my PC, I object to the over -
emphasis on computer oriented
communication. I understand send-
ing brief notes on e-mail because
it’s faster and you can communi-
cate with a larger group of people
more effectively.

Our Senior Colloquium pro-
fessor always sends us messages
over e-mail concerning upcoming
assignments and scheduling
changes. That is fine. Very help-
ful, in fact. But the replacement of
personal interaction by e-mail and
on-line services is ridiculous.

I once had to go to the library
on a Friday afternoon to do some
copying, and I witnessed a very
frightening sight. Outof the wood-
work and from behind their nor-
mal hiding places, droves of pale
kids who I had never seen before
started seeping into the “braire”
and logging on to e-mail.

They didn’t speak; they didn’t
smile; they were on a mission. It
was scary. It was like these zom-
bies who stay in darkness all day
had emerge to feast on the internet
lines through their precious e-mail.

' Fearing for my life, I had to
run. E-mail is great for sending
free messages to comrades in out-
of-town locales, but if I ever find
out that these characters are mail-
ing their buddies on campus, I’m
going to have to take drastic, vio-
lent action.

With all this computerized
communication we have lost the
skills of personal interaction. I
