ITH THE
ILDCATS

By JIM LOWRY

Since there is no sports news hardly of any sort around
here or anywhere for that matter, the sports column this week
will consist of almost nothing, as it usually does. The major
leagues are undér waw and+the Browns and the Giants, well
stocked with fancy four f flingers, are leading the league which
to none except the owners and the managers
who are trying to keep their jobs. Looking at the lineups you
see instead of Whoozit Lb, Whoozit 4f. It looks like the lineup
for the home tor incurable cripples.

The Senators appear to
be the only team-not full of faltering four effers. They have
a new twist. Their lineups sound like the Fordham football
You read it and feel like doing a conga or
a rhumba. Instead of coaches the Sens have translators. We
saw where Vice-President Wallace threw out the first ball at
the opening game in Washington the other day. This column
thought it would be & good idea if Dr. Cunningham threw out
the ball at the Cats’ opening game. After the game was over

same old story, no hit no field, no pitch, Base hits on the
Cat squad are searcer than fleas on a skinned poodle. It took

the Cats three times before old Jupitér Pluvius would let them
start a ball game. Eye Brows Hudson the Al Shacht of the
Cats said any time the farmers around here wanted to “know
when it would rain all they had to do was look at the baseball
schedule and they would know. George Floyd said he could
tell by the limbs that the crows sat on. If they sat’on a little
limb, it would rain, if-they sat on a big’limb it wouldn't rain.
Floyd also won the, high school oratorical Contest in South
Carolina several years ago. X X NX X’XThere has been quite a
bit of criticism about the this column some news

There have been quite a few funny baseball stories which

on the batter, looked at the batter and threw to first base
catching the man off first. The batter swung and the umpire
called them both out, but there is one in which Davidson

should have particular interest. It happened to Mr. Hengeveld
back in the days when he was pitching for Little Rock in the
Southern League. It seems back in those days clubs were
limited to a very small number of players and Mr Hengeveld

from the gulf and as the batter hit a low line drive out, into

ball. Well it seems Mr. Hengeveld chased the ball all the way
to the fence only at last to see it soar over the fence flapping
its wings merrily in the breeze while the ball had stopped
back many yards. The conversation which followed between
he and the manager is scarcely printable. The moral might

The Cats play Catawba Tuesday and V, P. 1. next Friday
and Saturday. Already this year several incidents have hap-
pened which resemble the clowns of last year. Hudson try-
ing to steal third with the bases loaded against Catawha
looked\very much like a Brooklyn Dodger stunt. Last Friday
against IP. C., with the bases loaded the Davidson pitcher
uncorked a wildpitch and when the smoke had cleared away
three runs had scored, the batter was’ still at bat and the
catcher*was throwing wood in every direction looking for
the ball, a carpenter on a scaffold back of the plate being the
only spectator. Ah, well, in the words of the immortal P. IF
Barnum, you ain’t seen nothing yet. And so until the next
time at the same time when ,we will be back with the same
old stuff at. the same old place we bid all a fond adieu, and
anybody that doesn’t like this column can come up to the
Davidsonian office and write one.
