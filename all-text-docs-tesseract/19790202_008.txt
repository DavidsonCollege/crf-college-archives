Cats’ Gerdy given S.C.
player of the week honors

John Gerdy was named the Southern Conference Player of the
Week on Monday for his sparkling performances against Wake
Forest, the Citadel, and Furman. He led Davidson to one of its best
basketball weeks in recent years with the victories over Wake and
the Citadel.

Gerdy had 89 points in those three games and strengthened his
hold on the Southern Conference’s individual scoring race. Gerdy is
averaging 26.8 points per game this year and has taken over fifth
place on the all-time Southern Conference scoring list by accumu-
lating 2,244 points during his career at Davidson.

Gerdy ‘scored 35 peints against the Deacons, 22 against the
Citadel, and 32 points in a 97-86 loss to Furman.

Davidson ranks fourth in the S.C. in scoring offense this year
with a point average of 77.6 per game. Davidson’s scoring defense
is rated at the bottom. The Cats have given up an average of 85.8
points per game.

Football recruiting is yearly
duty for Wildcat coaches

By ROB GILLISON

Assistant Sports Editor

Those of us who, despite
approaching mid-terms, have
been able to pull our heads out
of our books, get a breath of
fresh air, and take in our sur-
roundings, may have noticed
something.

There seems to be a large
number of hulking young men
being carefully escorted around
campus by the football coaching
staff.

What we’re seeing is the final
phase in a cycle that started last
March, and one that will con-
tinue as long as football is a
part of Davidson.

Last spring the coaching
staff started recruiting by send-
ing out forms that briefly
explained Davidson’s academic
and athletic programs to over
2,000 high schools, asking
coaches to respond with the
names of players who might fit
the criterion. Of the 4,000
names that have been returned,
many have been eliminated.

‘Some coaches think that if a
guy just goes to his classes, he’s
a good student,’’ said head
coach Ed Farrell.

Farrell added, “I don’t want
to look at a player unless he has
a good chance of getting into
this school. That’s the main
focus of our recruiting pro-

gram.”

‘Farrell also has to be careful
about where he spends the
money in his recruiting budget.
“We're allowed by the NCAA to
give prospects money for the
purpose of visiting the campus.
Usually this just involves .gas
money, but we do fly in a few
every year,’’ the coach said.

About 40 players have or will
visit the campus, which Farrell
sees as a good selling point.
“This campus provides a warm,
intimate atmosphere which a lot
of the boys like. Some do want
to go to a large school and be
just a number, but there are
just as many who don’t.”’

Another strong selling point
is the attitude of the team.
Farrell said,“ A 5-5 record is not
something we’re tremendously
proug of, but the guys have a
very optimistic attitude about
the future.’’

The point that Farrell and his
staff push is the academics for
which Davidson is best known.
The staff is predominantly from
the Northeast and know the Ivy
League schools very well.

‘“We honestly believe that
this. school, with its emphasis
on undergraduate education,
can offer a better education
than the Ivy Leagues. We try to
sell a kid on what a degree from
Davidson can do for him,” said
Farrell. “‘That’s what separates
us from all other schools.”’

Swim team keeps winning

By BOB GOULD

Whoever said Wildcats can’t
swim? After three consistent
victories this past week, Coach
Pat Miller is convinced that her
swimmers do it wetter.

Last Friday, the Cats handed
College of Charleston a 66-44
defeat. Craig Allen broke a pool
record in the 200 meter freestyle
and captured three first places.
Captain Mark Tommerdahl and
freshman Paul Voight also took
first places in three events.

On the following day, the
team scalped the Citadel (65-
48). Although no records were
broken, Pat Miller was pleased
in that no one swam a bad race.
Besides, the victory made a nice
present on the coach’s thirty-
sixth birthday. (Right Biz?)
Mike Shremmer took two first

places; Beck, Voight, and Tom-
merdahl each won one event.

In a Tuesday night ‘‘shut-
out’’, the swimmers duked
Johnson C. Smith (82-28). The
Cats took first and second
places in every event. Their
record stands at 8-1.

This Friday, Wild Fudley’s
Mother Duckers, coached by
Dudley Jenson, travel from
William and Mary to Char-
lotte’s Natatorium to take on
the Wild-catfish in a meet that
promises to be one of the
greatest of all time. The Catfish
are clearly the underdogs.
Davidson faces VMI on Satur-
day.

Coach Miller is clearly opti-
mistic about the team’s perfor-
mance at Conference on Feb-
ruary 15. A second place is
within the Cat’s grasp.
