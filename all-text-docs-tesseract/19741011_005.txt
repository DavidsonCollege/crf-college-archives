Professorial Poverty Brings —
Deserved Compassion, Tears

I must admit that I never
thought that professorial
poverty would become a mat-
ter of concern for me. ~
~ After all, members of the
teaching profession in our
society are held in high regard
for their intellectual
achievements, are respected
for their investment of their
energies in scholarly and
cultural pursuits, are ex-
pected to be shining examples
of moral sensitivity, and are
grossly underpaid.

It is a curious imbalance.
Compared with the squalor
which was depicted on the
front pages of this paper last
week, the professor doesn’t

Unrelenting Apathy Position

To The Editor:

It’s been a long time in
coming, but THE DAVID-
SONIAN has finally produced
its first generation of jour-
nalistic martyrs.

I’m impressed. Not‘only has
it brought my attention to
many of the pressing. social
issues in our community”
(i.e., the laundry and substan-
‘dard housing), it has also been
instrumental in compelling
ame to assume a position of
unrelenting apathy with
respect to anything but the
World Series.

It’s not that the causes you
support are not worthy of our
hearty support, but rather
that the manner of presen-
tation leaves something to be
desired.

To begin, as any political
philosopher will ter you,
alienation is not a very ef-
fective strategy for mobilizing
the masses. To imply that
we’re all puppets of the
educational — establishment, .
and then have the gall. to
present a cheap imitation of
20th-century ‘‘artsy’’ poetry
which could have been written
by most any Humanities
graduate, is to be regarded as
nothing short of a personal af-
front.

By the same token, empty
rhetoric also goes far to ob-
struct the realization of social
goals.

While the Sept. 26 issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN :was
replete with pictures of sub-
standard housing, I failed to
see a single picture of con-
cerned students painting a
house or picking up garbage.

I imagine that the staff ap-
peared (‘Excuse me, ma’am,
can we take a picture of that
tenement you call your
home?’), got their article, and
disappeared into the horizon.

What solace for the op-
pressed workers! Without
positive action, splashy jour-
nalism is nothing but
demagoguery.

Finally, there is the question
of realism. To expect that one
could change the entire
educational system by venting
his spleen on Davidson

ee ae ie a a es

American’ education,
doubt, is absurd.

Why not eliminate corrup-
tion in the executive branch of
government by firing a
seedy janitor? There is a
distinction to be made bet-
ween idealism and idiocy.

As a result of my disen-
chantment with campus ac-
tivism, I propose the following
plan to ameliorate all our
campus ills: Within 60 days,
close the laundry and convert
it into an apartment complex.
Then moye all the poor blacks
into’ that building, in. the
process tearing down all but
one of the tenements, which is
to be renovated. When the
modernization of this last sub-
standard house is completed,
move all the remaining laun-
dry personnel and any
dislocated students into it.

After all, they’re not in
vogue anyway.

‘Tony Snow ’77
Davidson College

To the Editor:

The few recent articles in
THE DAVIDSONIAN on the
state of some of thé\college
employees and college owned
houses is like a candle of con-
cern flickering in a forest of

self-apathy. Yet it is a candle }

in a jar whose light will fade
into the files of THE DAVID-
SONIAN and demonstrate
again how rational concern is
suffocated by a tradition of
repression.

The candle will go out, and
we will be left once again in

darkness, unless the students
open their minds and ex-

periences enough to allow that
light to burn.
It seems that the only hope,

this side of revolution, for the.

fulfillment of Rush Otey’s
“simple’’ wish for ‘‘a radical

=. change in many.corporate and

individual values,’’ rests with
the ability of the students to
detect and object to the subtle
‘signs of repression — that
surround us.

In our morally oriented
society repression is rarely
conscious. It is not surprising,
then, nor even particlarly im-
portant. that - . classical

the fact that nothing like

repressionist statements
should spring from the mouths
of Dr. Spencer and Mr. Currie.

Their personalities and
modalities of communication
and action were nurtured and
refined in a repressionist
society.

Students must look again at
the freedom in their lives.
How much of it do they really
have? The repressionist at-
titudes that control us all must
be illuminated. .

When students begin to
become aware enough to see
the subtle controls exercised
over by such things as:
“My house needs paint too;’’
‘We ought to go over and in-
spect it;”-. ‘Slum Clearing

i Awareness;’’ . and

housing articles appear in the
“Davidson Update;’’ then we
will have taken the first steps
toward attaining a true in-
dividual freedom and a life
that, as Reverend Otey says,
“is to be made tolerably
human, just and civilized in
this society.”

seem to have it so rough. AndI
am sure that none would want
to plead their case at the ex-
pense of the poor of any area.

But yet the contrast is as
striking when one considers
the economic future of the
professor. For today’s
business or -—engineering
student can look forward to a
first yeat salary upon
graduation which equals that
of the average associate
professor at Davidson.

And let us not forget that
horde of medical students
who, upon their release on an
unsuspecting public, will soon
be drawing incomes far in ex-
cess of those who supervised
their training.

Although this imbalance
should be something ‘about
which we are all aware, let us
set aside the sticky ethical
issue of who in society is en-
titled to what income, and con- -

sider the future of small,
prestigious liberal arts
colleges.

Admittedly, Davidson has
some administrative deficien-
cies at the present time in this
area. C. David Cornell, in his
parting shot, more than
demonstrated to us in his
childish and unprofessional
way, that though his
criticisms may have been
valid ones, he was not the man
for the job.

What we seem to have here
is an academically oriented
president who would like to
leave the fund-raising to
someone else (is anyone’s job
safe?) and a faculty with
highly divergent opinions
regarding administrative
priorities.

The only question seems to
concern which stream of
opinion holds enough political
clout among the powers that
be to weather the criticisms
and make its views policy.

No one denies that without a
strong and successful fund-
raising effort, faculty salaries
will not be sufficient to com-
pete in the talent market, and
Davidson’s traditionally high
level of quality in ‘its faculty
will soon lose out to com-
petition from. other _ in-
stitutions and other
professions. |

The issue seems to be the
gravity of the situation. Some
seem to feel that we are
proceeding along in fine
shape, others being concerned
with the possibility of this and
other colleges like it being
able _to withstand’ the
economic pressures that the
next few years hold in store.

But the thing which makes
this an-issue for me is that I
consider Davidson’s most at-
tractive quality to be the op-
portunity it affords for the
student to. pursue friendly in-
terpersonal relations with
professors'and their families.

If I leave Davidson with
nothing else, it will be with
fond and warm memories of
afternoons and evenings spent
in conversation sharing dinner
with the family or perhaps
just a paper cup of Kool-aid in
the kitchen.

As I sit and consider my
schedule for the coming term,
my decisions seem to be over. -
which professors I would like
to have before I . graduate
rather than which courses
look interesting. For at David-
son I have discovered the real
excitement that a fine
professor can give to an or-
dinary course.

Thus it bothers me that
while once income from
tuition and faculty com-
pensation were about equal in
the budget, the gap between
them now is a large and ever
increasing one well in excess
of one million. For the salaries
we are talking about are those
of people I consider friends.

And it hurts to hear a friend
tell of the steady decline in his
net income from year to year
as inflation and his increasing
economic: _ responsibilities
compete for his inadequate
salary. .

And finally it hurts to con-
sider that while faculty and
administration differ over
whose fault it is and what
exactly should be done, the
very future of this institution
over the next five to ten years
may be in doubt.

I am often accused of being
melodramatic, but that is why
faculty salaries have become
a matter of concern for me.

Stone Increases P.E. Options

Familiar by now to most
Davidson students is the
physical. education credit.
system under which each per-
son is expected to exhibit
proficiency in three in-
dividual and one team sports.
Equally familiar to many is
the opprobrium with which it
has been viewed in the past.

Last year most complaints
were indictments of
disorganized and inefficient
P.E. classes. Indeed instances
of consistently late or absent
instructors .occurred which
warranted some criticism.

This year, however, efforts
are being made by the P.E.
staff to upgrade the program’s

overall quality and to provide ~

appealing opportunities for
self-developmént. :

Courses in water-skiing,
karate, tap-dancing, cycling

ry

and archery have been added,
bringing to 28 the total number
of sports in which instruction

.and proficiency tests are of-

fered.

And for those who find
regimentation repugnant,
schedules of independent ac-
tivities may be forged.

The expansion of the P.E.
staff to 14 men was- a move
designed to augment the
program as a, whole. And
finally, credit book-keeping, a
proverbial thorn in the flesh,
will henceforth be handled by
asecretary.

According to Director of
Physical Education Chip
Stone, the entire P.E. depart-
ment is receiving new and
more positive impetus.

For those of us who are,
athletically ungifted and who
find adherence to a Spartan

i |

regimen distasteful, amena-
ment of the system may offer
a .means for fulfilling ‘
requirements with minimal
trauma. *

For a school which touts the
maturity and intellectual
superiority of its students, an
elective P.E. set-up is a
desirable alternative.

But at present, it is man-
datory, and thus it is a reality
to be confronted. We are being

- presented with a proposal to

meet half-way.. If systematic
improvements prove
workable, we should hesitate
to adopt an unenlightened
negativism toward physical
education. :

Quite possibly the system
will be no more effective than
in past years, .but it does
deserve examination before
rejection.
