Senators To Be Selected
Tuesday By Student Body

By BOB HOWELL
Staff Writer

The candidates for Senators
at- large from the respective
classes have officially filed for
registration and will be elected
this Tuesday, January 18, ac
cording to Supervisor of Elec
tions, Bill Lear.

“We'll definitely need to have
some run-offs the following
day, due to the large number of
candidates involved,’ observed
Lear.

Running for the three sena-
torial positions from the rising
Senior Class are Lee Farnell.
Steve Suflas, Bill Meier, and
Mike Creasman.

The candidates from the ris
ing Junior Class, three of
wnom will be elected, are

Bill Barnes, Mitchell Purvis,
Bo Philiips, Murray Hawkni
son, James Shepherd, Mack

Mitchell, — Bill
Thorne, Herb Dimmock, Hall
Whitworth, John Knox, and
Frank Smith.

Seeking election to the three
positions available to the ris-
ing Sophomore Class are Vince
Rabil, John Cassels, Will Rob-
ertson, Don Rhodes, Robert Cor-
lew, Tom Parks, Blain Butner,
John Hornickel, Bill Smith,
John Moon, Chuck Gladu, and
Bill Clark.

Reggie Kennedy and Bobbie
Blackwood filed a joint regis-
tration for senator at large for
the Senior Class but in accord-
ance with the by-laws of the
constitution, they will not be
allowed to run together.

However, they will each be
given the opportunity to run
separately, Lear said.

In addition to these offices,
there were three registrations
for the two positions open on
the Review Board. Running are

duPont, Dan

senior Dwight Grady and
juniors David Hanig and Tom
Case.

Bill Rolland registered unop-
posed for the position of Off-
campus senator, and is there-
fore clected by acclamation.

As in last Tuesday's election,
the polls in the lobby of the
Chambers Building and the
Post Office will be open from

8:00 a. m. until 3:00 p.m., Lear
said.

The candidate in each class
receiving the highest number of
votes will be elected the presi-
dent of his respective class.

In last week’s election story
we forgot to mention that Larry
Duncan ran unopposed for
YMCA President. THE DAVID-
SONIAN regrets the error.

cent total.

The only run-off called for is
in the election of Miscellany
Editor. Frank Erwin received
335 votes (46.08%), Bob Bolick
got 236 (32.46%), and the team
of Joe Earle and Jim Hanna
came up with 156 votes (21.46% ).

Lear indicated that the run-
off between Erwin and Bolick
will be held along with the elec-
tions of class senators mext
Tuesday, Jan. 18.

Paul Yarbrough carried the
election of YMCA Vice- presi-
dency and 55.17% of the votes
cast, as he defeated Wilson
Gunn 352 to 286. The team of
Jeff Allender and Bill How-
land was successful over Rob-
ert Corlew, securing 55.13% of
the votes, 387 to 315 to become

_co-station managers of WDAV.

The closest race was the cne
in which an election was actual-
ly unnecessary. Skip Holcombe
and Rob Krebs had intended to
run as joint candidates for
Freshman Advisor, reports
Lear, but registered independ-
ently. They were the only two
candidates running, and _ Hol-
combe carried 50.23%, ‘‘win-
ning” by just three votes.

In the referendum  concern-
ing the Senate’s policy which
denies the legitimacy of write-
in votes, 542 votes were cast
for ‘‘Yes’’ and 226 for ‘‘No,” in-
dicating that 70.57% of the
votets did not approve of the
Senate’s policy.

However, the _ constitution
States that a referendum must
represent two-thirds of the en-
tire student body to over-ride a
decision of the Senate, so the
measure was not passed, and
the Senate’s policy remains.

In the election for rising Sen-
ior Class members of the Hear-
ing Committee, the three vic-
tors were Joel Bradly with 123
votes (29.5%), Mike Stovall with
116 (27.82%), and Butch Bar-
ton with 110 (26.38%), over Dav-
id Varner with 68 votes.

The rising Junior Class also
elected three representatives to
the Hearing Committee: David
Bender with 166 votes (31.26%),
Steve Johnson with 141 26.55%),
and Jim Lehnberg with 121
(22.79%), over David Duggins
with 103 votes.

There were only three can-
didates for Hearing Committee
from the rising Sophomore
Class, so elected by acclama-
tion were Buck Farrow, Steve
Dodd, and Rick Love.

‘“‘We may have the ballots for
next week’s election on com-
puter cards,’ Lear added,
“which would greatly speed up
the process of getting the re-
turns back.”

He referred to the fact that
these last returns were in an
hour and a half later than in-
itially predicted, since each
vote had to be transferred from
the ballot sheets to computer
cards.

Clodfelter Reviews Past Year

I was asked by a member of
THE DAVIDSONIAN staff this
week to make some sort of sum-
mary statement about this year
in student government.

Its hard to collect one’s
thoughts about something like
this without them emerging in
“pithy statements” or ‘wise
pronouncements”; all I really
have is a series of unconnected
observations that may never
cohere that’s the nature of
a year in student government
at Davidson.

It has been a hard year to
grasp tangible accomplishments,
but | think perhaps that other
criteria are more important
anyway. With little real power,
student government accomplish-
ments seem always to be rather
vague and questionable.

Au administrator is influenc-
ed by what a student leader
says, or someone agrees to open
the policy process a bit —- these
are all that I can see.

In some ways the past year
has been the time of simmer-
ing, the heating up of a num-
ber of issues before they break
into a boil. It’s the time between
the first clear articulation of a
position and the beginnings of

real movement that are the
most frustrating.

When the new administration
entered office last year we were
at the end of a series of what
| would call “‘old style issues,”
things like self-scheduled exams
and students on various com-
mittees. The year has seen a
transition from issues of this
type to more basic ones, such
as coeducation and governance.

If anything can be said to
have been achieved at all, I
think it is the defining of the
major issues for the coming
years and the first steps to
mobilize students on those is-
sues.

Even where there was a spe-
cific problem — the senate’s de-
cision to rehire Meredith Hall
after the administration had cut
this portion of counseling funds
from the budget, the report on
the comprehensive fee, or the
interaction of the senate with
the Educational Policy Com-
mittee in redrawing the phy-
sical education program — the
real accomplishment was_ in
forcing administrators and fa-
culty: to recognize that the stu-
dent viewpoint had to receive
consideration before any deci-

sion could be made.

Probably the greatest frustra-
tion was the time wasted on
trivia; eternal referrenda on
minor questions, procedural dis-
putes, the Rennie Davis issue,
etc. where there may have been
some momentary controversy or
thrill but where little of sign-
ificance to the basic student
concerns was at stake.

I think much of the needless
dissipation of energy in student
government comes from the in-
ability of the senate to define
its role on the campus.

Implicit in every debate on
every issue was the question of
whether the senate should be
primarily a forum for debate
and communication or a_ work-
ing group.

The question is still unresolv-
ed. Who or what is the senate?

Perhaps more than immedi-
ately preceeding presidents I
was determined to try to let
the senate carry a major share
of the student government re-
sponsibility. It will be some
time, if ever, before I can de-
cide the wisdom of this course.

The year’s experience, how-
ever, has convinced me of the
need to separate the executive

officers — president and vice-
president — from the senate,
freeing them for what are more
properly their functions, lobby-
ing, speaking, pressing issues,
and allowing the senate to as-
sert its independence and stand
or fall on its own.

One of the most encouraging
develpoments of the year has
been the awakening of a small
but growing number of students
who are interested in develop-
ing independent and more com-
prehensive programs of simple
student services, ranging all the
way to such things as student-
owned bookstores and travel and
legal cooperatives.

Here is an area where Dav-
idson has much to learn from
other schools, but the value of
increasing emphasis here _ is
clear.

Student government has too
long beem purely political; it
musi begin to acknowledge and
develop the service aspect of
its responsibilities to the stu-
dent body. Here is where we
can finally realize the value of
organizations such as NSA.

So much of ‘the success of
