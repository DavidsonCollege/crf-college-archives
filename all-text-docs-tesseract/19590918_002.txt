The Long, Hot Summer

For orgavized labor it might have
been called the long, hot summer. For
years the public had tolerated the ex-

cesses of organized labor, just as it had
tolerated and then rebelled against the

excesses of big business at the turn of
the century.

All of the threats and coercion that
labor could muster were not enough to
stop Congress from passing the tough-
ened Griffin-Landrum Labor Act which
President Eisenhower signed Monday.

Just this week, court-appointed
monitors asked a federal court to oust
Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa, charging
that he had mishandled $675,000 in
union funds.

Hoffa “is the proverbial straw; ahd
the public will no longer bear his
weight. Surrounded, by a battery of law-
yers to fend off court action and harass
the court-appointed monitors, Hoffa has
continued to wave the Teamsters’ ban-
ners of power, the hot-cargo clause and
the secondary boycott.

He has discovered that he cannot
scare off the American public as he has
so done with union locals all over the
country. There are not enough black
limousines to. carry his goon squads far
enough to fill the nation with fear.

To combat public disfavor Hoffa has

Mere Chance?

The Davidson College Cadet Brigade
has again accomplished the highly im-
probable. The college, one out of
twenty-seven represented at Fort Bragg,
and having the small contingent of sev-
enty cadets out of a total of more than
fourteen hundred, was named as that
college turning out the best product at
camp.

Even more outstanding is the fact
that one of the meager seventy was
named the “Best Cadet” of the 1443.

One year. of these top ratings could
be written off as mere chance, but this
is the second straight year that David-
son has walked off with the honors. This
sort of thing could become a habit.

It is evident that the ROTC depart-
ment and the Cadet Brigade are col-
lectively one of the most productive and
effective organizations on the campus.
And, certainly speaking in a non-deroga-
tory sense, it is easily the most ‘‘gung-
ho” outfit that the campus has seen in a
‘long while. It is obvious that enthusi-
asm breeds success, and the converse is
true.

+ The Brigade is one of the few in the
country that is not ridiculed on its own
campus ‘and for this concession it turns
out a superior product.

Perhaps a little more honest enthusi-
asm and a little less do-nothing ridicule
would result in a better extra-curricular
program for all concerned.

R.C.S.

Peace On Earth

Chairman Khrushchev has come to
see us. Some are free in their praise of
the visit, but many are outspoken in
their disapproval, and many more shud-
der silently.

Here in‘ our Ivory Tower at David-
son, we do not feel competent to pre-
dict the outcome of this venture. We
doubt if any revolutionary decision will

a new scheme. He threatens to set up
a political fund larger than the aggre-
gate spent by both major political par-
ties in 1958 to insure election of candi-
dates sympathetic to his cause.

Hoffa may find it more difficult than
he thinks to elect Teamster puppets no
matter how much money he spends.

The McClellan Committee only re-
cently closed hearings which uncovered
for the public some of the rotten ap-
ples in the barrel of organized labor,
apples which threaten to spoil honest !a-
bor organizations if not thrown out.

On the state scene our spring visitor
Boyd Payton, Carolinas Director of the
Textile Workers Union, strayed from his
self-appointed Christian missionary
work and was Sentenced to six to ten
years for conspiring to blow up a power
sub-station in Henderson's violent téx-
tile strike, thus setting back the south-
ern labor movement for years.

For organized labor it was a long,
hot summer. And with the steel strike,
the longest in the nation’s history, en-
tering its ninth week, an Indian summer
could be beginning. The steel industry
seems determined to heed the demands
of the President and the public and of-
fer only a realistic, non-inflationary set-
tlement which will set the pattern for
further labor negotiations.

be reached during his stay, but ferhaps
an increased understanding between
countries will result.

There is one thing that we do hope
for, however, and that is that the Amer-
ican people will treat him with courtesy.
The fact that he was invited fo this
country by our President makes him a
guest, and he should be treated as such,
even though he may not merit it in
light of past actions or professed inten-
tions. Any discourteous action or unruly
demonstration could only injure rela-
tions and would probably be a boost to
Russian propaganda.

As we said, we don’t know what the
outcome of all this will be. For the sake
of international relations, however,
we're glad Mr. K is not coming to David-
son to speak in chapel.

J.H.

Over The Top

President’ Martin’s announcement in
chapel Thursday that the Dana Chal-
lenge goal has been met and surpassed,
although aceepted with seeming indif-
ference by the student body, is welcome
news and an encouraging testimony of
the faith that many have in the future
of Davidson College.

Our minds are preoccupied, perhaps,
with Rush Week, the Catawba game,
and the grind. Perhaps the reaction was
subdued because of the lack of the ele-
ment of surprise, so great was our con-
fidence that our many friends would
rise to meet the challenge. Nonetheless
we realize the magnitude of the glad
tidings.

The entire student body owes,”and
indeed feels, a great obligation to Mr.
Dana and all of those who enabled Da-
vidson to add to the physical plant both
science laboratories and a dormitory.
We feel an obligation to use these facili-
ties wisely. .

With appreciation and anticipation
we await the October visit of Mr. Dana,
our friend and benefactor.

SEEKERS.

Dr. Patterson

The analysis of class and
status in the United States was
long shunned by social scien-
tists in this country. This was
probably due to timidity—an
occupational disease escaped by
few -— about questioning the
fundamental tenet of an un-
stratified, classless society, and
to a desire to avoid being
placed with the Marxists who
put class and the class struggle

DAVIDSON'S SPRING

At the end of last semester
a man of plain appearance ad-
dressed an indifferent David-
son student body in chapel. He
told of his education at the
college of hard knocks and left
little or no impression with

‘those who listened: That man

was Boyd E. Payton, Carolinas
Director of the Textile Work-~
ers Union of America, member
of a debate team involving a
Management-Labor dispute.

In Henderson, a town some
fifty miles north of Raleigh,
there was a cotton mill strike
which had begun last winter.
Workers on strike at the Har-
riet-Henderson Cotton Mill
were members of the Textile
Workers Union of America and
Boyd Payton was their boss.

AT DAVIDSON

At Davidson, Payton was an
unnoticed person. Some called
him ignorant and others were
less kind. In Henderson, Boyd
Payton was a leader, a man
who made sense when he lifted
his voice at Union meetings.
He told the members how they
could have a better life, and
he seemed to have the money
to make his words stick.

But Payton with his Textile
Workers Union was fighting a
losing battle and the warming
summer weather seemed to
melt the toughness from a
strike that had called hundreds
of National Guardsmen to quell
the violence.

The strike itself began when
the president of the cotton
mills, John D. Cooper, refused
to renew his contract with the
Textile Workers Union of
America. Mr. Cooper refused

at the center of their theory.

Beginning the latter 1920's
end early 1930's, there has
been oan increasing number
of studies and enalyses of
class, caste and stetus in the
United States. Vance Peck-
erd’s, THE STATUS SEBK-
ERS, is the letest and best
known addition to these stud-
ies.

Mr. Packard has done a com-
petent job of analyzing and
synthesizing the vast amount of
the literature of sociology and
social psychology dealing with
the subject of status in order
to secure a respectable (very
essential in a status conscious
society) underpinning for his
argument and thesis.

His argument is presented
with « rich varisty of enec-
dotes, Instances, and quotes
from interviews that makes
for pleasant and smooth read-
ing, and which tends, un-
fortunately, in my epinion, te
mitigate against the disturb

Davidson Feature Editor

to sign the new contract for
many reasons, but one was that
workers were taking advantage
of their position as union
members. Their work had be-
come poor, and they were tak-
ing far too much sick leave.

The hot June sun was over-
head and fixed bayonets and
picket signs were common
sights in Henderson and the
State of North Carolina was
spending school improvement
money to pay the National
Guard.

Violence in Henderson end-
ed. Local police had long be-
fore arrested all offenders that
could be found. Rocks and bul-
lets no longer flew; they were
replaced by a judge’s stiff road
sentence and the moans of the
guilty.

The often slow wheels of
justice continued to turn, and
soon the State of North Caro-
lina arrested, found guilty and
sentenced eight men to prison
for conspiring to destroy prop-
erty of the Harriet-Henderson
Cotton Mills. Boyd E. Payton,
a name seen all summer in the
newspapers, headed this list.

MOB SCENE

I was in Henderson working
for the Raleigh News and Ob-
server the day Payton’s date
for trial was extended. High-
ly polished Union lawyers were
all around him as I waited on
the Court House steps with a
News and Observer reporter to
take his picture as he depart-
ed. The front lawn was crowd-
ed with high-spirited strikers
eager to show allegiance to
their leader.

As. Payton came out of the
door I took a picture and start-

Ing effects which the book
has, and should have, on the
reader.

Two. criticisms of the book
occurred to me. First, Packard
does not see, or chooses to
ignore, the relation between
the class stratification which he
discovers and political—decis-
ion making—power in the Unit-
ed States. (An excellent com-
panion for THE STATUS
SEEKERS is C. Wright Mills’,
THE POWER ELITE.)

Second, he does not see, or
again, chooses to ignore, that
the aspect of American society
which he treats, and which he
does not like, is an effect and
result of more fundamental
ethical, philosophical, and in-
stitutional characteristics of
American society.

ed to take another. He jerked
his hat from his head, brushed
it in my face and with his fist
back for a hard right said,
“TaKe one more and I'll cram
this down your damn throat.”
Angry strikers pressed around

and a verbal battle began. La--

ter on Payton apologized and
someone kindly remarked to
me, “You wouldn’t had a
chance.”

Payton was looking for a
fight that affernoon. It was a
good way to show people he
still had plenty of toughness
left, but some of it must have
been anger because he knew
he was slowly losing a strong
foothold in the South,

His appealed case now stands
before the State Supreme
Court and will be reopened
sometime this fall.

UNION STRATEGY

On the first of August a man
from the TWUA came to. the
News and Observer to get a
picture of a Henderson police-
man. He was going to make
a slide out of the picture and
add it to others he already had.
Then take his slide show up
north to show at union meet-
ings. A neatly typed caption for
the picture he wanted read,
“This cop was sternly punished
for not being tough enough on
the Henderson strikers.”

Northern union.members are
paying for the food that keeps
the strikers in Henderson alive.

The Textile Workers Union.
of America has had a hard time
in Henderson. It will continue
to do so, there and elsewhere,
until management and labor be-
come more willing to under-
stand each others problems.

class; to him, formal evening

In Vance Packard's THE
STATUS SEEKERS, the meas

eral enough, but who can de-

one approaches the “right”

pretty clearly that he dDuys so0-

HUGHES

Arriving at Davidson from the frantic bustle of New
York was like slipping into a quiet backwater of my na-
tive Thames. The impressive college buildings, fitting in-
to the graceful parkland around them, the trees stand-
ing rigid under the hot sun, even the cars idling ‘round |
the campus roads, seemed to indicate a sedate and almost

languid pace of life: °

‘ This illusion was shattered when I went into the
Union cafeteria, walked down a line with a tray and found
myself the possessor of a large meal within 25 seconds.
Later in the day I saw some not-so-languid football play-
ers at practice. I felt safer on my side of the fence.

Soon I came to realize that underneath this casual and
friendly Davidson exterior there was a quiet efficiency
which kept-‘the college humming.

When the freshmen arrived, a fleet of group advisers
and counselors swept in to herd them round their first
day of orientation. During the first few days, a rash of
forms and lists appeared, to: be checked, filled in, and
passed on to the authorities who doubtless have a proper

place for such information.

Now that Orientation week is over and rush week is
reaching its climax, I’m beginning to think that David-
son, given a few neon lights and skyscrapers could well
rival New York in its atmosphere of frenzied activity.

Beanie-clad rushees stream from house to house,
and the brothers spend long hours and sleepless nights
in trying to size them up. An air of expectancy holds the
college, and rushees and rushers alike seem to be looking
forward to the end of the week. .

Taken as a whole, Davidson gives an impression of

quiet purposefulness which

is sometimes belied by the

friendly informality of students and faculty. To a new-

comer, it is both welcoming and stimulating.

TOIL AND TROUBLE

Mr. K's Visit Is
Problem-Packed

By JOHN STONE

The foreign policy of John
Foster Duiles was completely
reversed last week within a few

‘months of his death as Nikita

S. Khrushchev and family ar-
rived in Washington for a fif-
teen day tour of the country,
coupled with top-level talks
with President Eisenhower.

Uncertainty surrounds the
event. No one seems to be
fully aware of what is hap-
pening, and no one is guess-
ing at the results. Some. in-
cident may occur, and the en-
tire complex of the situation
may’ be changed.

“|

Khrushchev comes with a po-
sition lof power to talk from.
The 'Soviet flag on the moon

gives’ him extra bargaining —

power.

If, as some ‘speculate, the
Soviets manage to get a man in-
to space during the next fif-.
teen days, he will have excep.
tional powers. Then again, any-
thing else could happen.

On the domestic front, many
conservatives — and this in-
cludes a good number of South-
erners—decry the visit of the
Soviet Premier. They — the
idealists in politics—consider it

with the Red Butcher of Hun-
gary.

Most Americans, however,
seem to feel that Ike knows
‘what he’ is doing, and a num-
ber feel that certainly no harm’
can come from the exchange
of visits, and some good could
result.

What might be the positive
benefits? There is specule-
tion that some sort of peace...
Pact may come out of the
talks. That would be fine;
but of course, Stalin and Hit-
ter also signed a peace pact.
To have a workable peace,
we must have guarantees.
Honor with the Russians
means loyalty to Marxism.

Some, including Vice Presi-
dent Nixon and Averill Harri-
man, feel that Mr. Khrushchev
is badly informed sbout the
United States. These gentle-
men have both been to Russia,
and have talked to Mr. Khrush-
chev; I am unable to contra-
dict them directly.

It is rather odd, however,
for the chief of state of so great
a country to be so ignorant
about his greatest enemy.

The tour of the U. S. plen-
ned for Khrushchev is not al-
together designed to clear up
misunderstandings. He will
visit the best examplds of
things, but he will not get
to see many of the typical
things, This is especiatly true
in the case of agriculture. |

In any event, we are about.

to give Presidential diplomacy
another chance. Let us hope
that some solution can be
reached. So far, we're batting
about. .000.
