Dance Troupe Captures
Intensity In Movement

By ALLISON WILLS

Toe dancing to the music of Prince is
highly unusual, but the Nanette Bearden
Contemporary Dance Theater made it
seem natural in what was perhaps the
most moving piece of last night’s perfor-
mance. The group specializes in combin-
ing the strength and discipline of tradi-
tional dance with the emotion and appeal
of contemporary movement.

Founded in 1976 by Nannette Bear-
den, the company strives to bring the arts
closer to the general public by involving
the audience in the intense energy and
sensitivity generated on stage. The effect
is dynamic, exciting, and sensual with
lighting and simple costumes designed to

accentuate the 12 dancers’ lean, strong

bodies.

The hour-long performance,- spon-
sored by the Black Student Coalition and
the Union, featured five dancers and was
a bizarre combination of strange move-
ments and intertwined bodies structured

by a conformity of motion. The second
was a short, effective duet performed
only to percussion instruments and char-
acterized by sharp, energetic move-
ments. Another short piece followed — a
solo by, Keith Henderson which had a
vaudeville theme, and featured mock tap
dancing.

The highlight of the show was a duet
performed by Robin Williams and Wal-
ter Rutledge entitled “The Beautiful
Ones.” Choreographed to music by Pr-
ince, this piece seemed to move the audi-
ence more than the other works. Dancing
on toe, Williams captured the elegance
of traditional ballet with controlled turns
and extensions while straying from tradi-
tion enough to establish an individual
style. Often a bent wrist or flexed ankle
updated the classical just enough to in-
corporate the rock music.

The performance ended with a piece
set in a ballroom in Spanish Harlem
featuring the entire company. Its theme
and costumes’ were distinctively
Spanish, and the movement incorporated
ballet with the humor and gaity of the set-
ting.

Outstanding choreography, young,
promising dancers, and universal themes
have won the company awards and praise
worldwide. While the dancers’ talent and
discipline aesthetically please audiences,
their superior ability to convey passion,
engages the viewer. Not only does an au-
dience witness dance in a performance of
the Nannette Bearden company, it also
experiences it.

Nanette Bearden dancers perform

— Music

By STEVE MANK

Most anyone these days can im-
itate James Brown. Even people who
have never heard him can, thanks to a
vicious imitation by Eddie Murphy
that sounds like “HEEOUGH!”

However banal Brown sounds, he
possesses a peculiar ability to excite.
More \than most any other artist,
Brown can force you to dance whether
you want fo or not.

Hig) new album, Unity, recorded
with Afrika Bambaataa, harkens back
to the mean embryonic stages of funk.
This is not synthesized and made lush
or programmed. This is hard, hard
funk, complete with a huge band play-

ing like a small one, complete with the
wailing, | woowooing, and __ the
“HEEOUGH.”

But the most fascinating thing
about Unity is the theme. Only James
Brown could get away with making a
concept album in 1984 — especially
one with the frequently repeated man-
tra, “peace, love, unity, and [of
course] having fun.”

The whole album is really only one
song interpreted many ways. In be-
tween each track (“Unity 1-6") 1s
strange shouting, sounding something
like, “man, this ain’t never been put on
an album b’fo’. HEEOUGH!""

Brown, who signs the liner notes
G. F. O. S. (“Godfather of Soul"), de-
dicates the record to the cause of
peace. Not nuclear disarmament, or
foreign aid, or helping the poor — just

peace.

Musically, Unity is not peaceful at
all. Together the drums and bass sound
like a rumbling volcano while guitars
twinkle somewhere far above. The oc-
casional horn riffs blare up in a Brown
imitation that beats even Murphy's.

What with Brown's vocal chord
ripping screams and Bambaataa’s yips
and caws, the album sounds downright
tribal. It should be no surprise that the
two dedicated the L. P. to the Zulu na-
tion.

But in many ways, in spite of its
good intentions, Unity does seem a
trifle idealistic. James Brown of all
people should know that an appeal for
peace should be accompanied by a
means of achieving it, or at least some

real social commentary.

Brown, though, has never really
been a cerebral artist. If anything, his
appeal lies in his ability to go right for

the ganglia.
His philosophy — and a noble phi-
losophy it is — is to make music so

moving that the listener is dancing be®
fore he or she can analyze the music in-
tellectually.

In that sense, it may be hard to get
peace when people only listen on a
very gutteral level.

It is to Brown and Bambaataa’s ad-
vantage, though, that the music 1s so
bold. For even though the message 1s
sometimes lost in the “HEEQUGH,”
the “HEEOUGH" ts the most impor-
tant thing anyway.

The Davidsonian presently has paid business
