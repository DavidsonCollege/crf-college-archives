Women's Tennis Defeats Coastal
Carolina and Kenyon

by LARRY DAGENGART

The Davidson women’s tennis
tcam is 7-3 on the year after win-
ning matches against Kenyon
College and Coastal Carolina.

In last Monday’s battle with
Kenyon, the Wildcats moved out-
doors on a chilly afternoon and
escaped witha narrow 5-4 victory.
Coach Caroline Price was not
exactly pleased, since Kenyon is
the sole Division III opponent on
the schedule this year. “We lost
our concentration; we didn’t make
adjustments very well and there
were lots of unforced errors that

kept us from getting a 7-2 win,”

said Price.

Although the Wildcats were
up 4-2-after singles, they couldn’t
put it away because Kenyon won
two out of the three doubles
matches. With the match tied at
four apiece, it took the freshman
doubles team of Cyndi Hess and
Barbara Grooms to win 6-4, 6-0 to
capture the victory.

In Wednesday’s matchagainst
Coastal Carolina, Davidson
showed better concentration in
defeating the Chanticleers by an
identical 5-4 score.

After the singles ended in a 3-
3 tie, Mary Beth and Tasha Ruth
took care of their doubles oppo-
nents 6-1, 6-1 for a4-3 lead, and it
was up to the number two team of
Jennifer Beahm and Sarah Melson
to finally take care of Coastal. They
got behind 0-3 in the first set, but
amazingly came back to win 11 of
13 games to win 6-3, 6-2 and cap-
ture the all-important fifth point.

With the win over Coastal, the
Wildcats now sport a 1-1 record in
the Big South. The team’s next
match is this Tuesday afternoon
against Furman.

The Wildcats stood 13th after

up and so did our scores,” said
coach Gordon Mietz. Mietz was

If you thought that finding a color
Macintosh* system you could afford
was just a dream, then the new, affordable Macintosh LC is a dream

you personalize your work by adding voice or other sounds.

Like every Macintosh computer, the LC is easy to set up and easy to
master. And it runs thousands of available applications that all work in the
same, consistent way—so once you've learned one program, you're well
on your way to learning them all. The Macintosh LC even lets you share infor-
mation with someone who uses a different type of computer—thanks to
the versatile Apple® SuperDrive’ which can read from and write to Macintosh,

MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple II floppy disks.

Take a look at the Macintosh LC and see what it gives you. Then pinch

yourself. It’s better than a dream—it’s a Macintosh.
