Visions

The sun creates a golden pathway
Through the valley,

Painting its glorious colors across the sky
And in every copse and crevice.

As | sit on the sands of time

Beside the cool waters of the lake,

The reflections of trees, rocks and myself :
Waver with the rhythm

~ Of the flowing water.

It creates a beat of its own,

’ Memorized only by nature,

And its quiet lapping on the shore
Relaxes me into

Oblivion.

The water creates a silvery mist
Making the air

. Moist and cool.

As | follow it across the water with my eyes,
It forms a delicate silver carriage
Drawn by silver horses

Their skin rippling with the strain
Of the muscles.

Sweet Diana’s raven tresses
Wave and flutter behind her, .
And she calls to her beasts...
They bear their precious burden
With reverence.

As | watch, the carriage travels

. Up the golden trail of sunlight

To a place hitherto unnoticed.

My majestic steeds of imagination
Fade into the sunset

Forsaking me...

But another day shall come

When | will rest on this very spot.
And | will allow myself

To remember...

To dream... .
And my lonely visions

Will return to me.
