four straight losses. Any hope of an at-large

Number four takes on special

By JENN HIGGINs

Four. \t seems like a rather normal num-
ber. It’s even. One wouldn’t think it to, be a
“odd” number. Well, it isn’t! It’s just been an
unlucky one for the women’s soccer team
lately. Losing by four in their past two games;
allowing 3 goals within the span of four
minutes; taking only four shots in their past
two losses; falling to fourth seed going into
the tournament—all of this evidence would
make most believe that the number four should

be somehow
eliminated
from the
4 minds of the
entire
Davidson
team (at least
until after the
tournament). But maybe the number four
isn’tas unlucky as it appears. We’ Il get to that
later. In a recap of last week’s games...

Last Wednesday, the Wildcats traveled to
Spry Stadium to take on the Demon Deacons
of Wake Forest University. Coming into the
match, the Deacs held a 7-7-1 record. Their
ACC experience showed early in the game by
putting away three goals before halftime.
Goal number one came in the 10th minute off
of a shot drilled into the

saves in her 69 minutes in goal, while sopho-
more Sarah Henry kept goal for the remain-
der of the game, making three saves of her
own.

On Saturday, the women’s soccer team
traveled to Greensboro to take on conference
rival, UNC-Greensboro. Tied for second in
the Southern Conference, the Cats needed a
win to remain the second seed going into
Tournament play on Friday. Yet the Spartans
were determined to shut down the Cats from
the very beginning of the game. Their first
goal was scored on a header off of a direct

kick just 14 min-

utes into the first
half. Junior full-
back Meredith

Seawell took the

direct kick for the
-Spartans from

about 25 yards
out where midfielder Kate Dylag got a head
on the ball. Dylag was credited with the assist
as Spartan forward Jenny Moore redirected it
into the goal. Both teams were held scoreless
throughout the remainder of the first half.

_ The second half saw spectacular finishes
by the Spartans as the Davidson defense
broke down to allow three goals in the span of
just four minutes. At 60:16, a scramble in the
box following a UNCG corner kick resulted

meaning for women’s soccer

Despite two tough losses going into the
Southern Conference tournament, the
Davidson women’s soccer team has plenty
on its side (even the fours). The inconsistent
play by many of their opponents this season
has shown that anything is possible going
into the post-season. A team like Wake
Forest defeats the #5 Tarheels one day, while
struggling in double overtime to defeat na-
tionally ranked NC State (who the Cats shut-
out earlier in the season). SoCon leader
Furman has been nationally ranked one week,
while barely noticed the next. Tournament
time means a clean slate, a fresh start. Sonow
the time has arrived for the best teams to show
themselves.

With less than four days until their
quarterfinal match versus Wofford, the Cats
afé still a strong contender for the title. And

it. has been four long years since they have
won the SoCon championship. Last year,
they proved how badly they wanted it in four
overtimes against Furman. This year, they
are fortunate enough to have two dedicated
seniors that will be playing in their fourth
SoCon tournament. And better yet, they have
Heather Maloney ’03, who is fourth in the
country in points per game and ninth in goals
per game. She is also ranked in the top four
in thé conferénce in almost every statistical
category (except goalkeeping). At 13-6 (6-3
in SoCon) closing out the regular season,
these Cats have proved that they can hold
their own against teams like NC State and
USC. Now they must prove to themselves
that they are the best team in the Southern
Conference. Because everyone else already
knows it.

beginning on Friday.

Sarah Falconi, the kind-hearted defender
from Cincinnati; grew into her.shoes over
the past few years as well. Although Sarah’s
only goal came in her sophomore year, no

dominant force on the field. She has started
in every game for the Cats since then.
Those who know Sarah would say she is
one of the nicest people they know. But on
the soccer field, she is a pure force to be
reckoned with. Her combination of experi-
ence and solid skills has made her one of the
most talented defensive players on the team.
Over the past four years, Sarah has proven
herself to be the anchor of one of the best
defenses in the Southern Conference.
Described by her teammates as “support-
ive” and “encouraging,” she has earned tre-
mendous respect from her coaches over the
past four years. Although she has not re-

teammates, het reputation as a dedicated

known off the soccer field.

Coach Tisdale praises Falconi as “some-
one who is looked up to because of the
trueness of her character and; who in her
own humble way, strives for nothing else
but the best for her team,” Sarah has consis-

one would argue that she has not been a .

ceived as much recognition as some of her "

and hard-working student athlete is well-

tently given everything she has on the field.
And because of that, she has inspired her
teammates to do the same after she’s gone.

The Davidson women’s soccer team has
improved greatly over the past four years.
Going from 4-13 to 13-6 is something that
these seniors can be proud of. Going from
losing to South Carolina 5-0 in 1997 to
defeating them 3-1 in 2000 is something to
be proud of. ‘Going from losing to UNC
Asheville 2-1 in OT in 1998 to crushing
them 7-2 in 2000 is something to be proud
of. Going from losing 4-1 in 1997 to an
ACC team like NC State, to holding them
scoreless in a 1-0 win in 2000 is impressive.
And the list could go on.

But what is most impressive about the
improvement this team has made is that
along the way it has created leaders.

As the soccer careers of Winnie and Sarah
come to a close, the underclassmen have
some big shoes to fill. And the way things
are looking, they are more than up.to the
task.
