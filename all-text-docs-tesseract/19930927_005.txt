VAX opens up world
of communications

By Carrie Blackburn

The electronicage has yielded
many new application programs
for computers that have changed
the lives of college students across
the country. Davidson students
are no exception. Through
Davidson’s own VAX computer
system, students can connect into
services such as electronic mail or
the Internet network.

Witha few simple key strokes,
even a novice computer user can
delve into the depths of the Library
of Congress, find out the weather
in Dallas, Texas, or choose a recipe
for a delicious meal from a menu
of cuisines,

Internet also offers the chance
to read the President’s speeches
and press releases or to write a

- personal note to the Clinton him-
self.

A wealth of information lies
waiting to be explored, but first

students must simply pick up their
VAX password at the computer
center on Main Street. They can
also register for workshopson how
to use the program. Once con-
nected to the system, VAX termi-
nals can be accessed at the main
computercenter, the labs in Cham-
bers and the library, or from a
dorm room via a modem.
Davidson has employed the
services of VAX since 1987, but
recent years have shown an ever-
increasing rise in its popularity.
Electronic mail (E-mail) pro-
vides theopportunity for students
and faculty to communicate
throughacomputerterminal. Con-
versations can be carried on simul-
taneously or messages may be left
for people to read at a future time.
Individuals may alsosend mail
tocolleges around the globe free of
charge in a matter of minutes.

Amy Norman talks with a friend on the VAX.

tor for Information Technology for
the college, sees E-mail as “a great
opportunity because the future is
going to have electronic commu-
nication as a part of everybody’s
lives. People short-change them-
selves if they don’t try it because
it’s simple enough to use.”

Since the typical college stu-
dent has a tight budget and many
long-distance friendships, E-mail
offers a chance to keep in touch
without spending a dime.

Senior David White uses the
VAX because “I can send mail to
people at other campuses and save
a phone call."

Other services, such as
Internet, provide a myriad of
sources for students to gain useful
knowledge or senseless trivia.

In the dawn of a computer-
oriented society, the electronically
challenged must overcome their
fears and explore the vast resources
available at their fingertips.

Student frustrated with Visual Arts Center restrictions

By Court McBryde

Since the opening of the Vi-
sual Arts Center, some students
have been disappointed that they
cannot use particular facilities of
the Center because they are not
currently enrolled in an art class.
However, the art.department es-
tablished these restrictions for stu-
dents, faculty and the community

in their use of the building at the
start of the year!”

One feature of the Visual Arts
Center are the various galleries.
The galleries are open to students,
faculty, and the community Mon-
day through Friday from 10 a.m.
until 4 p.m. and Saturday and Sun-
day from 2-5 p.m. The Visual Arts
Center Closes at 5 p.m.

However, students taking any
type of art history or art studio

class have 24 hour entry to the
Visual Arts. Their identification

cards have been coded to givethem
access to the art facilities at any
time they want access, such as to
studio, seminar, slide, or other
available rooms.

Sophomore Caroline Collie
wishes to use the facilities of the
Visual Arts Center; but because
she in not taking any type of art
class, she is not permitted.

Collie has been “throwing,”
or working with a pottery wheel,

Land a job with Career Services’ help

By Scott Windham

Carol Jordan has anew home.
She and her crew at the Office of
Career Services have moved—for
good this time—to the Julia
Johnston House on Main Street.
After years in the cramped base-
ment of the Union, followed by a
semester in Jackson Court, Career
Services is now permanently lo-
cated at 431 North Main, the house
with the white picket fence, across
from the infirmary.

To accompany her new quar-
ters, Carol has increased the num-

ber of staff members to seven, up
from four at the end of last year. In
addition, Carol reports that she has
expanded the range and quality of
services available at Career Ser-
vices.

The Office of Career Services
publishes a calendar of graduate
school- and career-related events
on campus and in the area, anews-
letter entitled Pathways, and a
weekly bulletin for minority stu-
dents. In addition, the office offers
frequent resume workshops, mock
interviews, interview workshops,

and seminars on career planning
and graduate study.

The staff at Career Services
stresses that the office can provide
services for all sectors of the stu-
dent community: underclassmen,
upperclassmen, and graduates.
Freshmen and sophomores might
take advantage of internship and
summer job opportunities, or use a
self-evaluation test to explore what
line of study or employment inter-
ests them. Upperclassmen might
enjoy the chance to spend a day
“on the job” with a Davidson par-
ent or alum, or interview with on-
campus recruiters.

Staff members add that Ca-
reers is committed to helping the
“smaller” populations at Davidson:
minorities, international students,
and the disabled.

An extensive library is one of
Career Services’ most valuable
resources, states Carol. She con-
tinues, “If you have a particular
interest, from instructing sailing in
the Caymans to finding a graduate
program in Chinese Literature, Ann
Melton in the Career Services Li-
brary can help you find informa-

‘tion on it.”

The library includes the fol-
lowing: graduate school and finan-
cial aid information; printouts of

alumni by occupation and city; in-

formation on travel and work
abroad; interviewing and resume-
writing guides; and service and
volunteer opportunities.

The staff encourages you to
stop by or call for information or

for four years and has obtained a
knowledgeable background in pot-
tery. She thought with the new
Visual Arts Center that she would
be able to continue “throwing.”

Collie talked to Professor Cort
Savage in the middle of August
about using the pottery equipment
in the Visual Arts Center. Savage
said that if she wanted to work on
the pottery wheel she would have
totake an independent study. How-
ever, this independent study has

two prerequisites: Sculpture I and
Sculpture II.

Collie commented that she
wanted to pursue her pottery “as an
extra-curricular activity not as an
academic. I want access, not train-
ing.”

Savage told Collie that if all
the Visual Arts Center’s facilities
were opened to everyone then there
would be no way to manage or
control the facilities. Savage com-
mented that a ceramics class is not
offered through Davidson’s Visual
Arts Center.

Collie expressed her frustra-
tion, “Throwing issomething I love
to do and Davidson has the facili-
ties, but they will not allow me to
use the pottery wheel.”

Savage explained that it is the
same idea as a science laboratory:
labs are not open to any random
student for experiments and nei-
ther are the art studios.

Freshmen
witness

mock Honor
Council trials

By Krisy Ford

For the past two weeks, fresh-
men, transfers, and faculty mem-
bers have filed into the old gallery
or multi-purpose room at their des-
ignated times to witness a mock
honor trial.

Members of the Honor olin:
cil demonstrated this trial during
two one-hour Monday night ses-
sions and one Sunday night ses-
sion. This session was required for
all freshmen, recommended to
transfers, and optional to faculty.

The purpose of this session
was not to go over the do's and
dont's of the Honor System. Ad-
ministrators explained all of the
rules and violations of the System
during orientation. The purpose of
the mock trial was to go over trial
procedures.

After orientation many fresh-
men were confused and scared
because the whole system of an
Honor Council and student con-
ducted trials were new. “Many
students had questions about the
trial and the role of student mem-
bers in the whole process,” stated
junior council member John
Philpott.

Although this council session
was shortened, members attempted
to give a real life scenario. The
offense was plagiarism. Astudent
obviously copied another student’s
paper.

The council tried to make the
offense obvious so that the view-
ers would not get caught up in
details; thus allowing them to pay
close attention to procedure.

The defendant testified first,
and then the professor. Ward Davis
presided over the trial and periodi-
cally would stand up to explain
something if it was not clear to
everyone.

Then the council went into
executive session and came back
with a verdict.

If the council arrived at ver-
dict of guilty, they returned to de-
cide sanctions. S

After the trial, each council
member sat in on a group of stu-
dents and answered any questions
they posed.

One major misconception
people seemed to have was the
number of trials a council member
would have to sit in on.

Thirty members reside on the
Honor Council. . In his last three
years on the council, Ward Davis
has only deliberated in four trials.
Many cases do not go to trial. Ifa
defendant pleads not guilty, he can
either go before Dean Terry or the
Honor Council.

Even if the defendant pleads
guilty, he can still opt to go before
the Honor Council for sanctions.

Overall, the mock trials were
short and concise, yet informative.
“This year our procedure was a lot
more laid back than previous
years,” said senior Ward Davis.
“We tried to make the procedures
enjoyable, but we also wanted to
make sure we addressed all ques-
tions or concerns.”
