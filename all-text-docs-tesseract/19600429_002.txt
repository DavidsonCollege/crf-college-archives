Woetul Lack Of Creativity?

It is evident that over the past few
years Friday chapel programs have
not been more than mere announce-
ment periods. Due to the lateness in
the week and the nature of the pro-
grams, Friday chapels have failed to
stimulate student interest.

Student interest can be increased
by changing the day for the Student
Council chapel from Friday to some
day earlier in the week, preferably
Wednesday. As it stands now, by Fri-
day most students are busy trying to
complete the week’s work before the
weekend trips and, consequently,
would prefer to have as much free
time as possible on Friday.

With intelligent planning the Stu-
dent Council chapel can provide an’
opportunity for many students to pre-
sent their ideas who otherwise might
never be heard. Debates can be ar-
ranged between students and mem-

bers of the faculty regarding the vari-
ous college policies such as: athletics,
admissions, and the academic pro-
gram.

Henry Shue has said that he hopes
to ‘stimulate more real depth think-
ing” (see article on this page). We
think this is possible through careful-
ly planned chapel programs and we
encourage him and his council to con-
centrate on stimulating student
thought and discussion.

If the Student Council isn't able to
provide worthwhile chapels, the Relig-
ious Life Committee will most likely
take over the planning of the pro-
grams and chapel time will be avail-
able to the council only by special per-
mission.

We hope this will not be necessary,
for it will only be an admission of-a-
woeful lack of creativity on the part
of Davidson students.

A Step In The Right Direction

In its first official action of the year,
the fledgling Student Council has tak-
en the Court of Control out of Friday
chapel and has shortened the period
of enforcement. After a false start
every spring for the past four or five
years, a council has finally taken a
step in the right direction. The trouble
is, where the Court of Control is con-
cerned, a giant stop was needed and
only a medium-sized ane was taken.

The Court, even this revised Court,
serves only as a symbol of decadence.
Only three of its regulations are worth
keeping and they could easily be en-
forced by a Student Council commit-
tee or some similar student govern-
ment group. Freshmen should be re-
quired to wear name tags and to learn
the college pep songs and cheers. An

effort should be made to cultivate the
habit of friendliness in them. But we

don’t need seven or eight hefty D Club
members to keep the law and order.
Abolishing the traditional Friday
call-down is the only move a just,
logically-thinking student council

could have made. The nature of the
Friday purges themselves made them
unfair and unjust by our standards of
legality. To freshmen, the -punish-
ment resulting from a violation of the
regulations was not running stud for
a hall in Belk, but being ridiculed be-
fore the student body in chapel. And
this punishment was enforced before
the freshman.had a chance to defend:
himself during the “trial.” In short, he
was considered guilty until proven
innocent. It’s supposed to be the other
way around.

Perhaps moving the Court of Con-
trol out of chapel is the key to the
whole problem of the Court. Certainly
the significant shortening of the
period of regulation enforcement will
keep this old tradition from being the
usual tiresome, long-drawn-out affair.

The Student Council. did not take
the giant step of abolishing this police
‘body in favor of a more constructive
group—but they took.a medium-sized
Step, which is better than nothing. We
congratulate them on a good start.

A Bewildering Problem

Tuesday morning the chapel walls
echoed a familiar word—lethargy.
Glyn Hughes observed that this is the
element about Davidson that ‘“abso-
lutely astounds” him.

Hughes was not the first person to
make this observation publicly. Last
year, practically every chapel speaker
was expected to make at least a pass-
ing reference to the problem of ap-
athy on campus or in our society as
a whole. This year the “apathy vogue”
has diminished somewhat, but none-
theless it has not totally disappeared.

Perhaps the reason apathy has be-
come a less-discussed topic is that the
campus has come to realize that the
accusation is valid. If apathy is dis-
cussed less for this reason, the editors
must admit that we too are appalled
at the situation.

Our Benjamin Franklin type of

common sense philosophy tells us

that the battle is half won when we
realize exactly what the problem is.
Yet, in the case of apathy, such knowl-
edge has proved of very little worth.
We simply sit back and with an apa-
thetic expression on our faces admit,
“Well, I guess I'm apathetic.” Our sal-
vation is that “the rest of the country
is the same way.”

Our attitude has grave implications
for our society. Lassitude and indif-
ference are hardly signs of health.

‘When we as editors search for solu-
tions, we find ourselves bewildered
for how does one stimulate a genuine
interest in a person who Simply isn’t
interested? Yet, bewildered or not, we
find ourselves desperately alarmed
over our doped intellectual senses.

New Council’s Action To Decide
Fate Of Present Friday Chapel

By BOB MOORE
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Increased complaints regard. .

ing Friday chapel programs
have brought action by the Re-
ligious Life Committee, an-
nounced Dr. George Staples this
week.

“Over a year ago the Relig-
ious Life Committee passed a
resolution strongly urging the
Student Council to make con-
Structive use of the Friday
chapel periods,” said Dr. Sta-
ples, the committee chairman,
in a DAVIDSONIAN interview
on Wednesday. “The Student
Council has done nothing about
Friday chapels.”

“At its February meeting
the Religious Life Committee
discussed the total program
of religious exercises, and
made a statement which rep-
resents the thinking of the
committee at the present,”
Dr. Staples continued.

“The statement is still in the
proposal stage. The committee
feels the Student Council should
have another chance and is
waiting to see what success
Henry Shue and his council
have with the Friday chapels
before voting on the statement.”

The statement is as follows:

Anytime the Student Coun-

cil wishes to present relevant
matters in chapel this time
will be available provided the
council plans well in advance
and reserves the dates on the
chapel cslender. The council
may use these periods to con-
duct student body elections,
discuss pertinent matters of
campus fife, and deal with
other business.

lt is not proposed that this
be a period only for announce-
ments; otherwise, the period
will be utilized for the presen-
tation of speakers both from
outside and within the col-
lege, and other programs of
interest and benefit to the
student body.

When questioned as to what
changes he plans to make re-
garding Friday chapel pro-
grams Henry Shue said, “I hope
over -a period of several weeks
the Student Council will be able
to have programs which will ap-
peal to boys of every interest.
The council can present issue
raising, question raising pro-
grams that deal with the very
basic questions of life. |

“Many boys have not been
given an opportunity to have
contact with the fine arts,”
Shue continued. He feels Fri-
day chapel programs could
show the value of e closer ac-

quaintence with the fine arts.

“Students could communicate
with the faculty and other stud-

osophy of education and the
real values involved. Friday
chapel programs can give boys
an opportunity to express ideas
which are generally not appro-
priate for denominational group
discussions and voluntary chap-
el.

“I feel that intelligently
planned programs can raise the
level of thought and discussion
of students here and stimulate
more real depth thinking of the
sort which should characterize
a true educational institution.

“The programs should not
be limited td religious and
philosophical questions, but
should be open to any student
or group of students who have
thoughts they would like to
communicate.”

Shue concluded, “I think we
would do well to change the
name of Friday chapel to as-
sembly and make no pretense
in the name that the program
is of a religious nature. I would
also favor changing the Friday
chapel to Wednesday so as to
attract more student interest by
avoiding the weekend rush.”

How ToDelouse Individuals
Or The Art Of Counting Fog

By ERVIN DUGGAN
Davidsonian Associate Editor

The U.S Army, not usually described as a subversive
organization, is doing an effective job of small-scale sab-

The victim: English composition.
The villain: Army textbook writers, who compound
into their various manuals some of the foggiest English

DULLEST WILL BE DROPPED

Next year, with the changes in advanced military
classes at Davidson, several of the ROTC manuals will
give way to academic textbooks. Some weapons manuals
*-perhaps the dullest of all the ROTC books—will be
dropped from classroom lists.

But many will remain, full of writing which is usually
translatable but alniost never clear.

LONG, STILTED PHRASES

an MS III manual: “Manage-

ment of movement capability of the transportation ser-
vice is concerned with realizing maximum movement
capacity over lines of communications.” (ROTCM 145-70,
p. 294). .

The passive voice reigns supreme.

abound.

And Army authors seem always to prefer the long,
stilted phrase to the clear, brief one.

“RENDER TIMELY ASSISTANCE”
“To help” in Army jargon becomes “to render time-
ly assistance” (ibid., p. 3), and “chronologically” becomes
“in point of chronology of occurence” (ibid., p. 3).
Soldiers are always ‘personnel’ or “individuals”—
seldom just “soldiers.” (One photograph in ROTCM 145-

70 is soberly captioned, “How To Delouse Individuals.”’)

LITERARY BOG
In the military idiom, nothing is merely “used”; it

“employed.” And no “levels”

exist in the military hierarchy: only “echelons.”
Another example: “Paralleling this development was
the growth of the realization within the armies them-
selves that the soldier was no mere automation respond-
ing mechanically, but an individual who gained in effec-
tiveness when consideration was afforded his feelings,

: “utilized” or, more rarely,

welfare and morale.”

The student’s welfare and morale, needless to say,
ents regarding Davidson's phil-|8¢t 4 rough workout in this sort of literary bog.

HOW TO COUNT FOG
Impressive but undefined terms crop up periodically.

as “transceiver network,’

“fluid situation,” “slow-moving situation,” and others
are employed without explanation.

How does such writing get done?

Part of the answer lies in the Army's “fog-count”
system of composition, taught this year to MS IV classes

’
one manual such terms

at Davidson.

The theory of fog-counting is that a sentence with
few syllables is a good sentence. Aspiring military authors
are taught to count up the syllables in ali their sentences.

But the theory doesn’t always work. Some writers
evidently forget to count fogs. And even the most fanat-
ical of fog counters apparently ignore the archaic rules
of good expression from time to time.

JARGON
The result?

RESULTS

Such ringingly clear writing as this: “While the basic
and general principles of one service may parallel some- :

what the basic and general

principles of the other arms

and services, the application of these principles will, to

a great extent differ.”

In the face of such ambitious composition, the reader
is almost embarrassed to ask, “Differ from what?” And
he need not ask. The manual does not say.

NO BIG PROBLEM

Is the miserable writing

in the military manuals a big

problem? If so, nobody cares much. ;
Maybe wide-range comprehension is not imperative
on the part of personnel where the aforesaid manuals

are utilized on instructional

echelons...

Senior Defends Paper, Campus Criticism;
Church Elder Explains Session’s Vote

Dear Editor:

The DAVIDSONIAN has re-
cently been publicly criticized
for directing “scurrilous and be-
littling criticism” at the col-
lege and things in general. I
should like to offer evidence to
prove that this criticism of the
DAVIDSONIAN is false and un-
fair, and, more important, to
examine the role of constructive
criticism, such as the DAVID-
SONIAN has offered, in a dem-
ocratic society.

The foltowing is a complete
list of the institutions or poll-
cies criticized editorially by
the DAVIDSONIAN second
semester and the correspond-
ing constructive suggestions,
which were offered with every
criticism.

1, The Artist Series was criti.
cized for lack of student interest
and it was suggested that avail-
able funds be concentrated in
fewer, more wifely appealing
programs. .

2, Athletic Scholarships
were criticized for being out
of proportion with academic
scholarships and it was sug-
gested that some of the money
be used for academic scholar-
ships,

3. The Rush System was ob-
jectively examined and Sopho-
more Rush was recommended.

4. The present system of
exams was criticized for failing
to achieve unity anda detailed
outline was given for a change
to comprehensive examinations.

5. The new IFC rules were
praised but Greek Week was
criticized and it was suggest-
ed that fraternities do more
worthwhile projects and help
in “improving the velue of a
Davidson education.”

6. The IMAC ruling on inac-
tives in fraternity sports was
criticized and a strong indepen-
dent team was advocated to
strengthen the whole league.

7. The Board of Trustees was
asked “to appoint'a committee,
including students and faculty
members, for the purpose of dis-
cussing...” the decision not to
admit Negroes.

This seems to be e mature,
carefully thought out set of

positive recommendations sin-
cerely aimed at meking Dev-
idson a better college.

There is, however, a more
fundamental issue behind the
controversy being treated here.
It is the role of criticism in a
liberal arts college. Many people
seem opposed to almost any con-
Structive criticism. But is not
criticism a first step in im-
provement and progress? Is not
one of the alms of a liberal edu-
cation to increase a man’s criti-

PRANTLIS

eal faculties?

t seems to me that the
eritical attitude is one of the
cornerstones of science. Our
democratic form of govern-
ment and our Protestant
church both arose from criti-
cism of the existing order. 1
think one of the major objec:
tions is the form it takes.

T feel that much that ‘has been
said this year has been taken
too personally and too negative-
ly where it was not meant to be
either. When Dave Warden says
Davidson is sick, he wants to cali
the doctor, not the undertaker
as even Dr. Richards seemed to
think

The interest in campus affairs
this year has been unusually
great. A part of the student
body has stopped being com-
placent and lethargic and has
taken an active interest in cam-
pus issues.

This development should be
encouraging to all of us. |
hope students and administra-
tion will continue to oxamine
Davidson College and continue
to work to make it a still bet-
ter school.

As fine a college as we now

may be, with new scholarships,
increased faculty salaries, a new
lecture series, and increased
student interest, we can still
grow. I hope the critical atti-
tude shown this year will con-
tinue to:serve as a stimulus to
that growth.

Session Member

Dear Editor:

The Session, of the Davidson
College Presbyterian Church has
been severely criticized for not
authorizing the use of the church
for the discussions between
members of the Westminster
Fellowship and students from
Johnson C. Smith University.

As a member of the Session

who greatly regretted the Ses-
sion’s decision in the matter,
§ should like to say that t
consider this criticism unjust
both In imputing unworthy
motives to the majority and
in assuming that the decision
wes made with unanimity.

The Session considered the
matter quite fully, discussed it
at great length, and tried to
make the right decision. Al-

though there were strongly con-
trasting opinions so equally di-
vided that the decision was
made by only oné vote, there
was no hard feeling.

Fear did not enter the deci-
sion at all. The decision was
‘mado eas it was because the
majority (with whom t dis-
egreed) felt that such a meet-
ing would heave undue pub-
licity and would be ill-advised
on account of the strong racial
feeling in the matter.

The majority of the Session
felt that such a discussion would
not serve a useful purpose but
might instead be construed as
a publicity stunt.

In writing this, I do so as an
individual and not as a spokes-
man. In loyalty to my comrades
in the Session, I ask that my
name not be published.
