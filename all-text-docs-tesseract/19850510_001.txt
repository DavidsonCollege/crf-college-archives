emphasized the meetings are
entirely open “and there is no
need for rumors” about the
committee decisions.

Kincaid was one of the orig-
inal founders of the ten-year-old
community center, which is
owned by the Mecklenburg
County schools. He said the
problem with the center is “pur-
ely the building.” He added
“The program is in great shape”
and “everyone on the Town
Board wants the program to
continue and strengthen.”

Though he said “the pro-
gram is rich and full and serves
a lot of people,” he emphasized
“nobody is satisfied with the fa-
cilites currently. Everyone has
an agenda about what to do with
the facility.”

He said “the town is not
satisfied with . . .
the utility bill.” The users, he

every group that has any interest

lack of handicap facilities, bath-
rooms for senior citizens, suffi-

cient lighting, _heating and |

plumbing. “It needs general
sprucing up,” he added.

Pam Johnson, Community
Center director, said “a new
roof is badly needed on one
building and needed on the
others.” She said “We're talk-
ing about lots of children” af-
fected by the conditions. “Dur-
ing the winter, the heat ig at 75
degrees but it’s oniy re hing
60 degress.” She said “it [the
roof] leaks when it rains hard.”
She added it’s hard to motivate
children to attend school under
those conditions.

Kincaid said “the first thing
the Commitee did was [to
examine] what programs and
activities are going on so as to
get a better idea of the kinds of
facilities we'd have if we had
everything we wanted. We're
still collecting that data.”

Second, he said the Com-
mittee focused on “the problem
of loiterers in the area of the
community center. The chief of
police of Davidson is handling
it with great skill and sensitiv-
ity.”

Third, he added, the Com-

mittee is examining “the op-
tions for rehabilitating the facil-
ity. As a starting point, I pro-
posed that we cansider the pro-
posal of Phil Haas, chairman of
hte Mecklenburg County Ag-
ricultural Extension Service.”

He explained that option
would involve taking down the
oldest building of the Commu-
nity Center and rehabilitating
the cafeteria, the newer class-
room building and the gym.
“The Committee didn’t take a
vote on it; we’re in the process
of collecting data on the cost of
pursuing that option,” he said.

Klincaid added “that is only
one option of many that the
committee will likely consider.
I don’t know what the final rec-
ommendation will be from the
committee but I hope and ex-
pect it to be a unanimous recom-
mendation.” He said recom-
mendation will go to the town of
Davidson and Mecklenburg
County who he hopes will share
the cost.

Kincaid emphasized “no
proposal has been made to
move the center from its present
place. the committee [has] not
discussed that in any way.”

Town Council Assesses Davidson Community Center

Davidson Committee Examines
Community Center

By TED WILSON

The Board of Commission-
ers of the Town of Davidson
voted 4-1 to publicly oppose
‘further federal revenue sharing,
in order to help reduce the fed-
eral deficit. The Davidson com-
munity center receives money
from Federal Revenue Sharing.

On February 12, 1985
Mayor Russell Knox wrote
North Carolina Congressman J.
Alex McMillan ‘the Mayor and
Board of Commissioners of the
town of Davidson, NC, go on
record as opposed to further
federal revenue sharing with
local governments and in favor
of the elimination of all federal
subsidies of every kind and na-
ture from the federal budget.”

Federal revenue-sharing
means, according to Knox's let-
ter, “the Federal government,
through grants, gives money to
State and local governments to
use as they please.’ Knox's let-
ter said Davidson supports
Reagan's effort to freeze Fed-
eral spending.

He wrote: “This town of
3,384 will receive $33,850 this
year from the Federal govern-
ment. They now say they don't
want it anymore. | commend
them all for showing the wil-
lingness to do their share in re-
ducing the Federal deficit.”

Randall Kincaid, a town
commissioner, who voted
against the proposal, said “it
was a political statement by the
Board of Commissioners on the
town of Davidson that said in
the current federal fiscal crisis
everyone must do their part, we
must do ours by seeing the reve-
nue sharing terminated.”

However, Kincaid said,
“the town board is unanimous in
saying that if the revenue shar-
ing [program] continues, we
want our share.” He said David-
son will “never” turn back the

money. He did not speculate
when Reagan will make a final
decision on revenue sahring.

Kincaid said he voted
against the proposal for three
reasons. First, “I thought the
word subsidy in the resolution is
undefined. It is vague, unclear,
and unfortunate.”

Second, “I wondered if we
should involve the mayor in
such a resolution, but he had no
vote.” Knox signed the resolu-
tion, but since the mayor votes
only in the case of a tie, he did
not vote.

Third, Kincaid said, “I
wanted to include a statement
that said in effect that the resol-
ution did not in any way call
into question our commitment
to the community center. The
majority was unwilling to de-
bate those points except for the
first and they had the votes to
pass it as it stood.”

Kincaid said the Board's
vote “should not have been a
surprise.” The issue “was
covered in the Mecklenburg
Gazette and the meetings are
open.” He added, “Why didn't
The Davidsonian cover Ww?”

Kincaid said “the communi-
ty center is partially funded by
revenue sharing.” If the pro-
gram is dropped trom the fed-
eral budget, “local — funds
[could] provide the balance,” he
said. He added, “I don’t speak
for the five committee mem-
bers, but | would vote for local
funds if the revenue sharing 1s
cut off."

He said “the town has a lot
of flexibility in its budget.” Be-
cause the population ty expand-
ing , the town will receive more
revenues. Both the property tax

lation of the town (such as beer
and wine tax, ABC revenues.

Trustees Approve Football Move To Colonial League

By ANDY BARRON

The Davidson College Board
of Trustees voted unanimously
last Friday to affiliate its football
program with the newly-formed
Division I-AA Colonial League.

Play in the Colonial League
will begin September 1987.
Davidson will remain in the
Southern Conference for the 1985
season. The status of the 1986
schedule . is. currently undeter-

mined.

Davidson is the sixth team to
join the Colonial League. The
other participants are Bucknell,
Colgate, Holy Cross, Lafayette,
and Lehigh. The Colonial League
approached Davidson in January
about the possibility of becoming
the league’s sixth member.

The Trustees also voted to
reaffirm Davidson's commitment
to NCAA Division I participation

in basketball and all other men’s
varsity sports. In accordance with
this decision, the Board endorsed
plans to raise $10 million to con-
struct a new sports center on cam-
pus.

The Southern Conference 1s
expected to decide whether or not
Davidson will be allowed to re-
main in the Southern Conference
after next year. Alternative con-
ferences for men’s varsity sports

(excluding football) are being in-
vestigated,

The main motivation for join-
ing the Colonial League 1s the new
league’s commitment to offering
only need-based aid to athletes.
Davidson has followed such a phi
losophy since 1974. In addition,
Colonial League members will be
able to schedule at least three Ivy
League opponents each year by
the 1990 season.

“It enhances our efforts to
continue to play Division LAA
well into the future and offers us
the chance to be associated with a
group of very attractive Colonial
and Ivy opponents,” said Athletic
Director Christopher Morris. “We
have played a number of these
teams ona regular basis during the
past 15 years and now welcome
the opportunity to formalize this
relationship ”
