PRAM To Seek Support

In an effort to meet a pro-
posed budget of $45,000 for
the coming year, the Project
of the Americas is looking to
large organizations for its
principal support.

According to Tom ‘Peddi-
cord, PRAM national direc-
tor, the group hopes to re-
ceive large grants from four

or five large organizations. in °

order to finance the bulk of
the 1968 budget.
They will apply to several

carefully selected _philan-
thropic groups for these
grants.

In addition, Peddicord said
the group hopes to receive
several smaller contributions
from local organizations
which have given to PRAM
in the past.

The PRAM program in-
tends to expand its summer
student exchange program
this year and at the same
time establish a program of
community aid and develop .
ment, oriented around a pilot
project in a slum village in
Quito, Ecuador.

Peddicord said this latter
effort would be carried on by
South American members.
but that all PRAM projects
derived financial support
from the money raised in the
USS.

He emphasized the import-
‘ance of the annual fund drive

this spring and pointed out
that the future success of the
organization depended on the
results of this effort.

“It's a pretty crucial year.
We want to expand our pro-
gram this year, yet we are

being forced to seek almost
-entirely new sources for our
funds. This has developed in-
to something of a test period
for us."’ he said.

Peddicord explained that al-

Haverford Gives
Student Freedom

By SILL SEIGLER
Associate Editor

Although the total freedom
given to students at Haver-
ford College perhaps repre-
sents too much of an ex-
treme, there are several as-
pects of the Haverford sys-
tem that Davidson might suc-
cessfuliy adopt.

’ This was the consensus of
Davidson sophomores Pat

Mullen. George Penick and

Joe Kilpatrick. who spent
Feb. 8-11 at Haverford, Hav-
erford, Pa., talking to stu-
dents and administration.
Their trip was sponsored by
the Student Council.

The entire conduct of the
Haverford student has but
one guiding principle and no
definitely stated rules: ‘‘Each
student shall be responsible
for his proper conduct with
respect to women guests and

Karl Boxer To Present

‘Blow-Up’ Jazz Program

The Karl Boxer Trio, a jazz
ensemble, will present a pro-
geam on jazz Tuesday in the
College Union as part of Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon’s ‘‘Blow
Up ‘68"" series.

The trio, based in Char
lotte, will present a short
jazz concert, to be followed
by Boxer’s presentation of a
dissertation on ‘The Aspects
of Jazz." A discussion period
will follow.

The program has_ been
scheduled for the Morrison
Room, instead of the SAE
House, so that the. concert
might be included in the pro-
gram.

The group, which has ap-
peared in several weekend
concerts at Davidson, con-
sists of piano, bass and

drums.

The Boxer Trio is the sec-
ond in a series of four pro-
grams to be presented in the

There are no restrictions
on persons in the living quar-
ters except that each student
be responsible for ‘‘his prop-
er conduct."' Instead of dor-
mitories, students live in
suites, each with lounge and
individual bedrooms.

There was also an absence
of academic regulations, Pe-
nick noted. What he called an
academic atmosphere ‘‘supe-
rior to that of Davidson.”

“People studied because
they wanted to, not because
they were forced to."’ he
said.

tor.

"With the exceptions of 16
pages of spring sports and
color pictures, the whole
yearbook is now at the pub-
lisher's,"’ Reed said

“The last several pages
will be sent in by March 2,
in time to be included with
the rest of the book.”

According to Reed, this
year's edition will be differ.
ent from yearbooks of the
past. It will feature 100 pages
of informal pictures, have
more space dedicated to

The publication is the re-

approach.

“Our 30-man staff has
worked hard and has done
an excellent job."’ said Reed.
“It looks real good.”

Other bills to be presented

student teachers legal pro-
