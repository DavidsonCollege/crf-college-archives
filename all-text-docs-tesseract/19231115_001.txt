In His Plea For “The Rediscovery of the Religion of Jeu” Mr. Wilson Brought to His Hearers |

Questions Worthy of Thought. His Forceful Manner Attracted All Who Heard Him.

le Hon. J. Stitt Wilson, of California, a well-known American exponent of workable ideas about industry, politics,
and religion, was secured by the Davidson College M. \. to lecture in Shearer Hall, Friday and Satur-
day, November 9-10. He brought messages of interest to every thinking man, .\s a sociologist, former city
mayor, college graduate, lecturer and man of experience in the world of men today, Mr. Wilson in his forceful

the Davidson-Armistice Day-Davidson Col-
lege Highway celebration, last Monday, spoke
toa small audience of about 800 people, touch-
ing upon times of interest for their patriotic,
governmental and historic note. He spoke of
post-war conditions in the United States, the
progress of the state in
schools, asylums, ete.,
” status.

Governor Morrison was introduced by
Hon, W. C. Wilkinson, of Charlotte, a mem-

regard to roads,
taxes and its finaticial

her of the Highway Commission from the |

Fourth district. In introducing the gov-
ernor, Mr, Wilkinson said that during his
administration more had been accomplished
in road-building, etc.,
been brought about in any similar period in
its history. He added that the name of
Governor Morrison would surely go down in
the state’s history its
governor,

In beginning his speech, Governor Morri-
son said: “We are here today to celebrate |
three wonderful achievements in the history |
of this community, state and country: the
foundation of Davidson College, Armistice
Day, and the dedication of Davidson College
Highway.” He said that the college's con-
tribution to the state can not be calculated,
that it has not only trained many of the
leaders in this state, but it has also trained
many who have gone forth in other states of
the South.

“This is a fitting spot to celebrate Armis-
tice Day, for it was here that our leader
spent part of his boyhood days and got a
part of his training.” With this statement,
the governor proceeded into his subject, be-
ginning with the signing of the -armistice,
and, through the League 0 Nations troubles,
brought it down to the present time.

He said that, following the time when
Woodrow Wilson, a former Davidson boy,
led us into war when we could no longer stay
out, the weakness of republic overcame us,
and “I am sorry to say that factionalism,
