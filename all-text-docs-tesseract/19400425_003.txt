’ If the ‘Y’ could dare to adopt a
fresh and strenuous program for
the coming year, despite the ex-

might see signs of progress. The

Cabinet has obviously failed to give.

to their job the life and leadership
it demands. Aggressive efforts must
at last be made toward developing
the NORMAL. man as. exemplified
by Christ. Spiritually and intellect-
ually the ‘Y’ is thoroughly “mud-

dling”; for our sakes this must
be corrected, despite the “old

Dan Gilliam, Senior:

With the building of the new

library we have an opportunity to
make the old library into a new
social. center. To bring’ more  stu-

move the student store into the
basement,

The ‘Y’ Cabinet should represent
as many types of boys on_ this

campus as possible, both conserva-

daily chapel exercises. They fail so

monotony that is not caused by the
attitude of the students but by the
program in itself, There should be
some remedy for this condition. I
would like to put before the stu-

would be five chapels a week with
no meeting of the student body on

Wednesday, and Friday, would be

and students are not usually stim-

hearing the constant repetition of
such words as goodness, faith,
beauty, and happiness. Give us
something to think about. The
other two days would be devoted
to student body purposes with
fewer petty announcements.
Under these conditions the pro-
gram would be relieved of mon-

speakers, offer opportunity for
more select talks. :

Camera Club

The Camera Club is planning
a photography exhibit to be held
in Eu Hall about April 30 to
May 2.

Those contributing prints will
be Mac Parker, Ray Hoover, Ed
Maxwell, Angus Lytch, and Lin-
Banker. Although the pic-
tures will not be hung on the
walls according to types, they
may be classified into the fol-

lowing groups; portraits, land-
scapes, still life, action, and
animal studies. The exhibit is

expected to contain about fifty
prints.

Although there were two ex-
hibits the fact that
the darkroom was not ready for
the Club’s use in the Fall made
exhibit then impossible;
therefore this will be thes only
photography exhibit of the year.
With regard to there being only
exhibit this year Angus
Lytch, president of the Camera
Club, said, “We'll try to make
this the
good.”
