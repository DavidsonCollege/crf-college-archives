The Davidsonian

Grim’s Revered By Midnight Riders

By MARK DEATON
Managing Editer

For years. cenfirmed Davidson
procrastinators dedicated to working
through the wee hours of the morning
curtly close their books, drop their
pens, desert the scattered pages of their
half-finished term papers, and rally
around a Volkswagon in the parking lot.

Doors readily swing open and
somehow manage to close despite
having admitted five passengers into
the back seat.

The Grim’s Run is on.

A caravan of hungry students speed
out of Mecklenburg County, accelerate
into Iredell, elude the Mount Mourne
Police, sneak through six Mooresville
traffic lights, and pull up to the curb op-
posite the Mooresville Police Station.

Small car economy engines cease
their muffled six cylinder mutterings.
Doors slam.

An unostentatious white building, its
dimly lit shop quietly assuming its
place behind the cursive gold neon
‘tasty cakes’ and ‘golden crust bread’
signs on the windows, is suddenly filled
with the clamoring crowds of students
on their study breaks. A sign in the win-
dow reminds customers to serve bread
at every meal.

Feet shuffle over a strange design of
green, ochre, scuffed red and black
floor tiles as the students wait for the
Grim Baker to appear from the back of
his bakery.

Soon, stern grey eyes peer through
dark-rimmed glasses, scrutinizing the
noise makers who have turned the quiet
shop into a busy marketplace.

A Bic pen is drawn from the pocket of
a white shirt partially covered by a full
length apron, and an authoritative
voice mixed with mirth and anger asks,
‘‘How many want doughnuts?’’

‘‘Got any hot ones?”’ asks the regular
customer.

“Oh sure, they’re hot."’

Various responses of two to a dozen
emanate from the crowd.

A handful of small brown paper bags
emerge from under the counter, and the
Grim Baker retreats to his back room.

Seconds later, the short man, laden
with bags of doughnuts, returns to his
shop through a door marked ‘Em-
ployees Only.’

‘‘Now who's first?”’

The student pushed in front of the
counter timidly meets the gaze of the
Grim Baker.

‘‘Now what else?”’

‘“‘Uhh, give me two chocolate eclairs
and an orange.”

The Grim Baker bends to reach the
eclairs from the display counter
separating him from the customers.

Quickly moving to the large glass-
windowed _ refrigerator, the Grim
Baker picks up a pint carton of
Meadowland orange drink and hurries
back to the counter.

‘‘No, I wanted a bottle of orange
juice,"" an embarrassed but irritated
voice reluctantly admits.

The baker frowns at the liberally
educated student who hasn't suf-
ficiently mastered the Grim's lingo to
ask for *‘one orange juice. open."’

The refrigerator door slides open.
The untouched carton is replaced and
the orange juice bottle grasped.

Clunk, pop, the bottle is opened, and
hurrying feet clop back to the counter as
the cap rattles on the floor.

‘‘What else?”

“That's all.”

The scribbling Bic pen whispers on
the newsprint pad.

“That'll be 93 cents.”

A dollar bill quickly passes over the
counter, and the back of a white shirt
collar overlapped by apron strings is
exposed as the cash register drawer
opens and a hand promptly grabs seven
pennies while the other hand pushes the
drawer shut.

The brown bag is already splotched
with dark brown stain, indubitably at-
testing that the hot, just-fried Grim’s
dunkers contained within are working
their way through the brown paper.

Finally, the shop is empty of
customers. The Grim Baker disappears
to the back room.

Students return to their cars. Keys
turn in ignitions, doors meekly close
behind filled hands and stomachs.

The after-taste of greasy doughnuts is
easily washed down with the purchased
milk, lemonade, fruit drinks, chocolate
milk, but there is no relief for the cast
iron lumps in cramped stomachs as the
unexplainable and amazing tran-
sformation of doughnuts into dead
weight hits the travellers about the
time they reach the fourth Mooresville
traffic light.

With the Grim’s Run anticipation
destroyed, the return trip is made in
gloomy silence except for the un-
friendly growling tones of upset
stomachs.

Recollections of a long night of work
left on the desk painfully reassert them-
themselves.

The walk back to the dorms from the

da

tennis courts is accompanied by
various curses as the previous parking

space has already been taken.
Students vow that they will never
precrastinate with their studies like

this again. They swear they'll never
need to make the Grim’s Run again.
However ---

Traditions like the Grim’s Run are
not made of such.

for a hot doughnut at a chilly

The door squeaks and groans
as the cold Mooresville air
pushes itself into the shop.

Students are caught in the
cross fire of bakery aroma
pushing the cold air back
through the door.

A porcelain Howdy Doody
head with a laughing jester’s
countenance is perched on a tall
wooden cabinet behind the
display counter.

R. C. Powers, the Grim
Baker, fills six orders, and the
shop door closes, leaving the
baker alone. But the
Mooresville Bakery is by no

Powers.

‘“‘Mrs. Powers takes the day

plained. ‘“My daughter

Through the aoor to tne
mixing and making areas, Rob-
bins, the hunched back baker,
leans over a long, low table,
reading scales with flour
covered lead weights.

Robbins, who has been baking
for 35 years, indicated that he
used to work the coal mines at
Cabin Creek, 32 miles from
Charleston, West Virginia.

‘Got tired of mining. Could of
got killed. Baking’s much more
interesting,’’ he explained.

After pouring his weighed
ingredients into a mixing bowl,
Robbins shuffles to the
refrigerator, a wooden room en-
tered through a latched door
which opens grudgingly.

Silently moving to a large
baking oven, he opens the mon-

dough and removes another. A
wave of heat escapes from its
black bowels.

He walks past a square white
roof support on which a clip-
board of 1920 recipes yellows.
He grabs a spatula from a
collection of kitchen utensils
hanging on the column, and
scrapes cookie dough from a
pan.

-Returning to the weighing
table, he disappears in a cloud
of smoke rising from a scoop of

flower into the scales.
Flourescent light filters
through the settling particles.
