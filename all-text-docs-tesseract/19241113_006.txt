Three Scoreless Ties in Football His-
tory of Two Schools—First Game
at Davidson

Should Davidson win this afternoon’s game |
the post-war record of the Wildcats and |
Tar Heels will stand tied, with each club |
credited with three wins and the one famous |
scoreless tie of 1920. Dope fiends, however,
have discovered that in the nigh-thirty years
of football relations between the two schools |
that Carolina has walked off with 15 games |
while Davidson has won only three. Three |
games have gone to scoreless ties. |

The football relationship between the two |
institutions began in the fall of 1897 when
the Tar Heels defeated Davidson in Char-
lotte by a 10-0 score. In rapid succession
the Carolina squad piled up five straight
wins until the first scoreless tie of 1904. Net
strange to say it was in that year that the
now famous Carolina coach represented the
Davidson team, playing a ripping game in
the backfield.

However, it was only until 1910 that the
fighting Wildcats placed the Red and Black
banner above the Blue and White, when L.
Richardson picked up a Tar Heel fumble
and raced 60 yards for not only the first vic-
tory of the Wildcats but the first touchdown
ever scored by a Davidson player on the
Carolina team.

After several more defeats came the World
War, when in 1917 the two teams did not
meet. In 1918 with only four letter men
back at Davidson, Coach Fetzer built up a
team that was able to hold Carolina four
times within the one-foot line, winning 14-7
when Red Johnston raced 80 yards with a
pass from the famous Spann at quarter and
later in the game scored on a sweeping end
run,

The next year was the year of Runt Lowe’s
greatest playing for the Tar Heels. His
punting was one of the wonders of the game,
Carolina winning 10-0 when he drop-kicked
for a field goal and Spaugh, another Win-
ston-Salem boy, scored a touchdown. Fer-
rington, still another Winston product, kick-
ed the extra point.

In 1919 came Gig Shepherd to Davidson
and in November he swept for 25 yards
around Carolina’s end for the only touch-
down of the game, as Davidson won on
Prince Albert Field, in Winston.

Red Johnston, this year at Carolina, and
Spratt Moore, had a battle royal on the same
field in 1920 when the two teams fought to
the third scoreless tic. That too was the
last game to be played in the Twin-City.

The following year found the “wonder |
team” from the University beating the Wild-

cat eleven 29-6 in Charlotte, a pass, Hendrix
to Davis, both playing today, scoring the
Davidson touchdown after a march up the
field from the Wildcat 29-yard line.

Last year Coach Younger for the first
time led the Wildcats against the Tar Heels
and for the first time the two teams played
on the home ground of the University boys
at Chapel Hill. Doped to loose by a great
score, the crippled Davidson machine turned
loose a terrific attack that outgained the Tar
Heels, but lost 14-3. Hunt, on the Davidson
team today, scored the field goal after a
march down the field, in the first minutes of
play.

North Carolina Wildcat
‘Stirred Up Over Contest

Carolina Has Purchased Davidson
Ram for Own Use—King of
Golf Flock Held

Wherever one hears the name David-
son College in that place one hears
of the “fighting Wildcats.” When they
received that cognomen one does not
know but in the years and years that
have elapsed all have agreed that it is a
fitting name.

Last year through the courtesyof an
alumnus the Davidson campus had as its
guardian the first live Wildcat. Import-
ed from the Everglades of Florida it
found the North Carolina climate too
severe and during the summer of 1924
passed into a better land.

A few weeks ago another Wildcat, this
time a real North Carolina feline, cap-
tured near Fayetteville, was secured.
With a ferocity far surpassing that of
the southern kinsman and on a par with
that of its fellow-wildcats, it today paces
its narrow cage with a stealthy step and
a gnarling stare.

The pedigreed ram that the University
of North Carolina has recently adopted
comes: from the native haunts of the
real Wildcats, having been purchased
last week through Dr. Arbuckle of the
Davidson faculty. Repeated efforts were
made to secure the king of the golf
course flock, but all in vain.

Why the Carolina boys have adopted
a ram is not known and whether they
wish to be called “Rams” or “Rammers”
is a question, But that in the wired

cage is a little fur-covered feline which
would give its life blood for one moments

fight with Mr. Ram is beyond question.
