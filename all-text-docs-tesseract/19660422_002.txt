The Quiet Visitor

Monday’s constitutional referendum
may come and go before a number of
students are aware of what has actu-
ally happened. A number of students
have expressed ignorance over the
very existence of the referendum
while others are confused about what
the coming vote will entail.

The lack of the usual amount of stu-
dent agitation and fanfare which has
traditionally preceded constitutional
referendums can probably be explain-
ed by the somewhat unexciting nature
of the changes proposed.

The changes are being undertaken
primarily as a result of Student Coun-
cil and Honor Court study, not as a
direct outgrowth of student unrest.

But despite the dry nature of the
amendments, both the section dealing
with the new student regulations court
and the amendments. to the Student
Body Regulations have merit and
should be approved. ;

The main justification for the court
will be its freeing the Honor Court
from the responsibility of dealing with
student conduct and allowing it to con-
centrate its efforts on improvements
to the Honor System.

It is appropriate that a body entrust-
ed with overseeing the honor of the
entire student body should not have
to deal with such trivial matters as
too much noise in the dorms.

The new court, which will try only

Short-Term Deal

A Story by the Associated Press this
week told of a Radcliffe student ad-
vertising in the Harvard Crimson for
a Harvard man who would be willing
to marry the Cliffe. But the enterpris-
ing female was not an ordinary hus-
band-hunting co-ed, anxious for se-
curity for the rest of her life.

The female only wanted a husband
for a year, in order to escape Radcliffe
dormitory life. According to the col-
lege’s rules, only married students
can live off campus, so she offered,
through her ad, to share expenses with
and to cook for the lucky Harvard
boy, and incidentally, she would mar-
ry him for a year.

“I only want a roommate, not a hus-
band,” she is reported to have said,
“but he’s got to marry me to satisfy
Radcliffe.” ;

“T just want to live off campus and
earn my degree in history,” she com-
mented, “because it's quieter there,
and I can get more work done.”

Few here would disagree with her
points on the advantages of off-cam
pus housing. The impersonality of
such sterile surroundings as Belk
Dorm add little to the college experi-
ence, for the atmosphere is anything
but conducive either to good study
habits or to getting to know one’s 80-
odd hallmates better.

But we find it hard to imagine a par-
allel situation occurring here; sheer
economics would make one stop and
think twice before taking the step’to
escape dormitory life. Few can afford
to rent an off-campus apartment, ex-
cept when necessary, as is the case for

Welcome, Fred

We welcome back to campus Fred
Smoot for what has almost become
his annual visit. His stellar perform-
ances in two preceding Spring Frolics
have made him a favorite with the Da-
vidson student body, and his week-
long stay promises to endear him even
more to the community. |
_ Just as welcome as Mr. Smoot’s visit
is the pioneering spirit shown by the
new Union Board in kicking off a new
year of programs. The night club mo-
tif, if given the support of the student
body and community, could well be-

cases of violations of Student Body
Regulations, while not regularly elect-
ed as a court, will pose little danger
of wielding any despotic powers, or
developing into a local adaptation of
the Gestapo, The court will consist
entirely of class officers who as elect-
ed officials will maintain a respon-
siveness to student feeling.

We would likewise urge deletion of
the regulations dealing with gambling
and hazing. Both were installed under
circumstances substantially different
from today and have little contem-
porary relevance. ;

Any incidents of hazing ordinarily
occur in. a connection with the frater-
nity system and enforcement should
logically be left with the Interfrater-
nity Council. The IFC, which would
naturally be much closer to the situa-
tion, has agreed to undertake enforce-
ment of any hazing infractions.

Likewise. the rule prohibiting gam-
bling was passed under a moral code
differing considerably from today’s.
Today, gambling by itself is rarely
considered immoral. Should the vote
decide in favor of keeping the rule,
the student body will, in effect, be as-
serting its willingness not only to
abide by the rule, but also to enforce
it. The recent “brown-bagging” con-
troversy has shown that a law which
exists but is not respected or enforced
is worse than no law and actually be-
comes a farce.

married students.

The college’s position to single stu-
dents is a reasonable one, given the
circumstances. It is necessary for the
dorms to be utilized in order to real-
ize the highest gain from them. Even
though single students may find off-
campus life more desirable, the col-
lege has carried out its obligation of
providing adequate housing.

But the college likewise has a re-
sponsibility to married students, a re-

sponsibility which has been largely °

neglected. So far, married students
have had to depend almost exclusively
on renting from private owners in the
area. With the dearth of high quality
apartments easily accessible to the
campus, rental prices have been blown
out of proportion to their worth. One
cannot hold the property owners re-
sponsible for charging what the traf-
fic will bear; such are the ways of the
free market.

But at the same time, there is no
need for the situation to remain un-
changed. The college owes its mar-
ried students attractive, reasonably
priced housing.

The present extent of college prop-
erty used for this purpose consists of
four houses in Jackson Heights. just
off campus. The “Cardboard Village”
houses are inadequate, both in num-
ber and in guality. The best thing that
can be said for them is that the rent is

‘reasonable.

We urge the college to take the
steps necessary to acquire property
which it can rent to married students,
so that these students can come in
from the doghouse.

come an integral part of the Union
program and provide at least part of
the solution to the question of what to
do for on-campus entertainment.

The Hungry D Restaurant will next
week be belying its short life of a few
months with.a professionalism of good
food and top-notch entertainment.

We urge student support to accom-
pany the enthusiasm shown by Union
President Peter Parrott and hope that
this new venture will portend more
such activities for next year.

Dear Editor:

As one who took part in the
hastily-organized (therefore less
effective than it could have
been) anti-ROTC demonstration
during federal inspection, I must
voice my astonishment at Sam
Johnson’s now-you-see-me now-
you-don't letter in the last issue
of this paper.

No one invited Mr. Johnson up
to the parapets at Duke, and no
one extolled him to give vent to
continuous ‘Sieg ‘Heil!’ cries
once he was there. We were in
fact carrying on a time-honored
if somewhat moribund tradition
at Davidson—the tradition of the
Peon Army, a para-military or-
ganization designed to ‘‘make it

ABHORRENT SPECTACLE

We believe that the ‘spectacle
of several hundred supposedly
intelligent young men being turn-
ed into machines to serve the
state is morally abhorrent, that
the traditional professional sol-
dier is a dangerous anachron-
ism in a world on the verge of
revolution such as this planet
has never seen before, and that
compulsory ROTC is wrong for
any one of several dozen rea-
sons.

Davidson gentlemen” to shut up,
adding that he would come uu

Interesting logic, that: What
this ‘‘gentieman - and officer”

For two days the Davidson
man was involved in an impos-

sible dilemma, that of trying to

sex for an entire weekend.

Now Spring Frolics is over,

or so trying to figure, without
success, just what went wrong
so it won’t happen concert week-
end, even though we know that
if it doesn't, something else will.

most complex members of the
human race. To try .to expla'n

opposite sex just doesn't think

any female, and she will tell you

can get along without her, and
the other members of her sex.
as constant companions, even in
the classroom. (Think how many
good jokes this would cut out of
professors’ lectures: it’s just not
reasonable.)

The very fact that we are only
able to see any quantity of fe-
males for two out of seven days
in a week makes our job doubly
hard. It is difficult enough to
meet her demands when you are
really experienced, but we have
no chance of comprehending her
impossible ideas and desires
when we see So little of her.

The female was made for the
male, not vice versa. She is the
one that should be able to do
the understanding. She willingly
should meet the male more than
half-way, but co-eds just don’t
seem to know this. They play
with men’s destinies without
even realizing it and the slight-
est glance can ‘make’ or
“break"’ your relationship. They
don't seem to realize what au-
thority they wield, whether con-
sciously or not.

It really seems that the male-
female relationship is governed
by the law of diminishing re-
turns. The harder the male tries
to please his girl the more she
demands of him. Whether she

A Review
By WINIFRED P. MINTER
Assoclate Professor of
Political Science
James MacGregor Burns’

Deadiock of Democracy deals
with the state of political parties
in America and comes to the
conclusion that they are not ful-

filling the fundamental role that

they must play in order to pro-
vide viable democracy. This is
because of the conditions and

the manner in which they were
conceived and their inability to
adjust appropriately to modern

demands.

The U.S. Constitution was con-
structed during an age of funda-
mental distrust and suspicion of
the power of government. In the
late 18th century atmosphere of
the Philadelphia Convention, the
prevailing sentiment appears to
have been a preoccupation with
a constitutional structure which
would through an elaborate sys-
tem of checks and balances
provide countervailing powers
which would resist the develop.

the precepts of our present day
democracy had not yet been for-
mulated. Equality before the
law was an accepted principle;
but political equality was asso-
ciated with radicalism and irre-
sponsibility. Control of the gov-
ernment by the masses would
be as suggestive of political tyr-
anny as would be control by the
privileged nobility. The solution
was sought in seeking a system
which would promote a balanc-
ing of interests, of compromis-
ing differences, of moderation
in the political results.

This system has remained ba-
sically unchanged even though
parties have developed and be-
come the essential linkage be-
tween society at large and the
government. As democracy grew
in America and spread its in-

fluences, broadly based grass-.

roots parties were inevitable
concomitants. For democratic
government cannot exist with-
out party systems to translate
the pressures applied by the va-
ried components that constitute
the electorate into public pol-
icy.

A theoretical democratic mod-
el for a party would assign it
the following functions: unifica-
tion of the organs of govern-
ment, designation and support
of candidates for public office,
crystallization of public opinion,
assumption of responsibility for

CONFUSED FRESHMAN

I would suggest that Mr. John-
son's letter reflects little more
than a confused freshman. If he
is going to continue, to hold a
liberal, pacifist posture in his
future life, he had damn well
better Jearn td develop a sense
of moral courage commensurate
with that position.

As for losing his “friends”
who might have been upset by
seeing a Nazi emblem (sewed
into the center of a Confederate
flag—we thought the irony was
rather nice, but I guess there
are few things harder to sell to
conventional minds than irony)
... all I ean say is that anyone
in the ROTC ranks stupid enough
to see the demonstration as pro-
Nazi couldn’t be worth the at-
tention of an intelligent man.
Such “‘friends’ are well lost.

If Mr. Johnson wishes to con-
tinue as a liberal individual, he
should learn that one of the
ground rules for survival is nev-

er to underestimate the possible

consequences of an act. before
he undertakes to perform it.
Foresee them, then—if the cause
be worth your commitment—ac-
cept them. Otherwise forget it
altogether.

EMBLEMS FITTING

And yet, I cannot but think
that the appearance of Nazi em-
blems was rather fitting.. Basic-
ally, there is no difference be-
tween the gung-ho, win-or-die at-
titudes of some of the advanced
ROTC boys and the attitudes of
the young storm troopers who
used to stand at attention in a
drill field and set off live prac-
tice grenades on top of their
helmets to prove their manhood.

Ground

Sexes

from this point there is no place
to go but down as we men well
know. The female must under-
stand that what we strive to do

- arises only out of a concern for

her welfare. We must convince
her of this. or we will find more
trouble than we already think
we have.

May Heaven help her if she
would trade places with the pres-
ent bulwark of society. To have
her husband crying on her shoul-
der because the dishwasher
over-flowed and blew a fuse just
as something important was
about to happen on ‘‘The Secret
Storm” is surely not a very
promising picture. Does your
date realize the amount you
spend on her? If she wants more
equality and ‘‘undertstanding"
try some divvying of expenses.

It is just like a woman not to
rethink her position and see that
it is the most favorable one con-
ceivable; instead she must push
for what she hasn't got to see
what it would be like. (She
would have one very large fac-
‘tor going for her if she reigned
supreme; she might know how
to deal with women.) They don’t
really know how well off they
are.

Professor Burns states that

to function properly. He pro-

the historical growth of our par-
ty systems, demonstrating how
our institutional and constitu-

their decentralized and frag-
mented character made it im-

Defend Johnson

Dear Editor: ;

Sam Johnson's letter to the
editor (THE DAVIDSONIAN,
April 15) was a forced apology.
Instead of writing in response
to honest discussion of the de-
monstration at drill. April 12,
1966, he drafted his letter, call-
ing the demonstration a mis-
take, as the result of anonymous
personal attacks upon him.

We would like to ask who
should be making apologies,
Sam Johnson or his classmates
(Would you believe — fresh-
men?) who placed unsigned
posters outside his room as a
reaction against his part in the
demonstration?

SATIRE

The demonstration, it seems
to us, could have been easily
seen as an excellent satire on
militarism, open to the possibili-
ty of various interpretations —
from a plea for pacificism to an-
outcry against ROTC regimenta-
tion. All that was actually ap-
parent in the demonstration it-
self was a caricature of the-
military, exagerated to its ex-
treme — ‘fascism.

Should one interpret the de-
monstration as un-American
(these charges have been level-
ed), he would only display his
reverence for the State as an
institution rather than the ideas
for which it stands, viz. freedom
of speech. The persons who at-
tempt secretly to silence those
with whom they disagree are
promoting the un-American
ideas for which they criticize
Johnson (Sam). In the last an-
alysis, they themselves have be-
come fascists.

CONVICTIONS

Need anyone apologize for ex-
pressing convictions on national
issues? We are saying that one
should not only keep his con-
victions but also express them
without fear of personal attack.
Sam does not owe the student
body an apology for freely ex-
pressing his convictions. No, the
persons who drove Sam to feel
that such an act was necessary
should themselves apologize.

Davidson College

Political Parties Play Incorrect Role

“Deadlock of Democracy.”

Mr. Burns has a number of
suggestions designed to break
the deadlock and to provide par-
ties the opportunity to meet
more nearly the theoretical re-
quirements of a party in a de-
mocracy. He advocates such re-
forms as control of national
elections by the national gov-
ernment, party organization at
the grassroots level based less
on committee and more on par-
ty clubs, the separation of na-
tional candidates from local can-
didates on state ballots, modify-
ing the rules of Congress so as
to end the possibilities of minor-
ity control through seniority and
filibustering, and better financ-
ing of parties so as to broaden
the selection of nominees and
to result in less chance for par-
ticularistic groups to control.

One detects a bias, perhaps.
for the British type of party sys-
tem with its interest in more
unified, centrally directed, and
simplified organization. But he
clearly indicates that tinkering
and innovating are not enough.
Without the proper leadership.
no party system will give the
desired results. The ‘Deadlock
of Democracy” is a very stimu- .
lating book and raises relevant
and important questions which
no interested and serious stu-
dent of democratic government
can miss considering.
