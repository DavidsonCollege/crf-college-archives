NEW COLLEGE BELL DEDICATED AS
MEMORIALTO DAVIDSON HERODEAD

HON. BREVARD McDOWELL, DONOR, OF CHARLOTTE,
SPEAKS AT IMPRESSIVE CAMPUS CEREMONY

a

A ceremony unique in the annals of
Davidson College was held Thursday morn-
ing. The large new bell was dedicated to
the Davidson boys who made the ‘supreme
sacrifice on the altar of patriotism and gave
their lives for their country in the late
war. It was also given in charge to the
present generation of Davidson boys and
to the untold future generations that are to
come,

Dr. J. W. MacConnell introduced the
donor, *the Honorable Brevard McDowell,
of Charlotte, as sometime Mayor of Char-
lotte, a man of great service during the war,
a man of many achievements and a David-
son man of '69, Doctor MacConnell told of
how Mr.- McDowell's friends, ever in the
faroff hills of sunny Trance, admired him
and how universally beloved he is wherever
he is known, Doctor MacConnell also spoke
of the unselfish gladness and willingness with,
which, out of the generosity of his heart, Mr.
McDowell had given the béll. He told of the
pending plans of having the bell placed in a
tower with a clock to strike the passing
hours or the possibility of its being placed
in the tower of the future Chambers build-
ing,

The donor spoke of his gladness in giving
the bell to his Alma Mater and the joy its
dedication to the loyal sons of Davidson gave
him. He bore out the statement of Doctor
MacConnell that he khew more about David-
son than any other living person, telling of
many interesting experiences he had there
and of many exciting incidents that had hap-
pened in the days of the long ago. He then
presented the bell to Davidson in memory of
her immortal sons who died in the war.

Doctor Martin accepted the bell in a few
well chosen words, and voiced the apprecia-
tion of Davidson and its friends to Mr.
McDowell. He charged the students to ever
protect the bell and guard it from all harm.

At this point, Sam Davis, representing the
student body accepted the charge and thank-
ed the donor for the bell.

The honor of ringing the bell was especi-
ally reserved for the donor. At the last note
of the bell, cheer after cheer rang out from
the students for Mr. McDowell and the bell.

The invocation was made by Doctor Rich-
ards of Davidson and Doctor Johnson, pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church of Char-
lotte, who also made a short and apropriate

talk, pronounced the benediction.

trains them. It usually makes a smart man
smarter, and a fool a bigger fool.”

“BUCK” GURRIE SPEAKS AT
Y.M.C.A. VESPER SERVICE

Large Attendance at the Initial
Sunday “Y” Meeting

The Y. M,C. A. held its opening service
Sunday with Buck Currie, the secretary, as
the speaker. His text was from Esther 14:4.
“And who knowest whether thou art come
to the kingdom for such a time as this?”
This question was forcefully brought home
to every man present.

“Although God is not once mentioned in
the book of Esther, there are

FACULTY GREET FRESHMEN

AT ANNUAL RECEPTION’

Speeches of Welcome Made by
Faculty and Student Repre-
sentatives

The annual reception, given to the incom-
ing Freshmen Class by the College “Y” was
held last Monday night in the gymnasium.
From the start of the reception line to the
fade-out of the movie, the whole affair was a
pronounced success.

The first event on the program was the
usual reception line, including the faculty,
their wives and some of the village folks.
made and
everyone seemed bent on giving the class of
"26 a hearty welcome.

After having completed the circuit of the
reception line and incidentally the ice cream
and punch booths, attention was turned to
the formal speeches of welcome. After a
few introductory words by Bob Gordon,
Buck Currie, the new “Y” secretary and Pat
Crawford the president, bade the new men
welcome and assured them of the aims of
the association to be of service to them in
any possible way.

Then followed speeches by Sam Davis in
behalf of the Student Body, Sig. Shepherd
for the Athletic Association, and Talley
Elliott for the Literary Societies. Coach
Grey also made a short address, outlining
the athletic program for the future and tell-
ing of the activities of the Alumni for David-
son athletics. The closing talk was that of
Doctor Shewmake who welcomed the new
men in the name of the faculty and ex-
pressed their earnest desire to help and serve
them on every occasion.

The final, and perhaps most enjoyable
event of the evening was a movie “Over
the Border” featuring Betty Compson and
Tom Moore. The music for the occasion,
furnished “by our orchestra composed of
Elkins, Earnést, West and Crane, was much
apreciated and ‘enjoyed by the entire audi-
ence. -

On the whole the occasion was a tremend-
ous success toward making the freshmen feel
that they are becoming an integral part of a
“Bigger and Better Davidson.”
