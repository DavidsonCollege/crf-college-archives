win letters there are two that have not made
a letter before, Anderson and Hewlett, both
of the Sophomore class, who played con-
sistent basketball throughout the season.
Captain “Sook”
won the “D"” on the basketball team and
each year found him in there fighting like
a true Wildcat. Sook plays guard and his
brilliant work both on defense and offense
has been outstanding. Fast on his feet and
possessing a steady head, Sook cuts off many
attacks at his team’s goal, and few are the
cagemen that are able to get by. him.

Boggs has three times

“Spec” McConnell won his letter for the
third time. “Spec” also plays the guard po-
sition. “Spec” during the last season was a
wonder at throwing goals. Always on the
alert and dashing in when they least ex-
pected it, he breaks up many plays of the
opponents and when he gets the ball it is sure
of finding its way through the basket.

Mac Beal for four successive years has
played forward. Mac is a consistent player
who is always to be counted on. He is also
among those who rank highest in the scoring
end of the game.

Staley has won a berth for three succes-
sive years. Tom has been looked on as.a
regular “speed demon” on the court. Ap-
pearing to be everywhere at once he keeps all
the members of the opposing team on the
alert. Tom is also a high scorer, rarely
missing when he gets a shot at the basket.
He has played forward all three years and

his place on the team will be a hard one to
fill.

Flake Laird because of his brilliant work
at forward the past two years has well been
, selected for the captain of next year’s team.
| In basketball as well as in the others sports
jin which Flake plays an important part,
Flake has done his share of the work.
Equally as good on the defense as on the
offense, Flake always distinguishes himself

‘by his playing. Under his guidance the team

Duke University wants to meet the young
Wildcats in a dual track and field mect, and
'the Davidson coaches are working to get
that little deal through.

Saturday’s meet showed that the Fresh-
man class has a good bit of material in that
line. In winning the first Davidson Initiation
Track meet over a field of strong schools the

John Currie was certainly the big man of |

‘the meet. His time in the first heat of the
100 hundred—10 1-5 seconds—ties the David-
son record for that event.

Other valuable men on the team are Mc-
Connell in the mile and half «mile, Goody-
koontz and Brand in the 100, 220 and 440,
and Williford in the two mile. Anderson
will probably go good inthe hurdles and pole

With the Oak Ridge double-header sched-
uled for Friday and Saturday afternoons, the
baseball team will at least have a little ex-
perience by the time we meet State, the fol-
lowing week. This game is scheduled for
April 1, but there is a possibility that it will
be changed to the last day of March.

him, ‘

Andy Hewlett also distinguished himself

year and was able to make the grade of the

midable forward and is respected for his

several of the old men.

STATE GAME NEXT WEEK

The Wildcat nine will open the season!
Friday, playing Oak Ridge Institute here at |
Davidson, The game is the first of a two-|
game series; the second will be played on
Saturday afternoon, These two games will |
be the only ones played with Oak Ridge this |
year and they will be hotly contested. }

Although Oak Ridge is only a Brepernord |

school, strong baseball teams are always |
turned out. Last year Davidson succeeded
in annexing both games of the series but
only after a hard struggle. H

Both teams have been working hard in|
anticipation of the games, they being the!
first encounter of the season for both teams. |
Coach Monk has been molding a smooth)
working machine for several weeks and the |
prospects are that it will be even a better |
team than last year’s.

Oak Ridge has a most competent coach
in E. K, Holt, who has been there for four
|or five years, His teams have established
| a notable record in and out of the state, and
| this year’s team will be no less worthy of
| the name they have established. There are
| several individual stars for the Oak Ridge
|team, but one of the main factors of their
| success is their team work,

Dutch Hengeveld, of Davidson, will um-
| pire both games. Dutch has umpired in
| Many games in and around Davidson before
and has been very satisfactory at this job.
| The probable line-up of the two teams will
