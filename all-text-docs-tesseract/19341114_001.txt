ASSEMBLE IN HIGH POINT

Newspaper Men fien Make Talks On
Journalistic Work

Five Davidson representatives attended
the North Carolina Collegiate Press As-
sociation Conference which was held in
High Point on Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday of last week.

Those representing the local Board. of
Publicatioys in its first meeting with the
Association were: K. D. Weeks and Joe
Wadsworth, for “The Davidsonian; Lo-
renzo McPhail and Ben Wyche, for The
Yowl; and Ben Rose, for Quips and
Cranks. Bob Smith, editor of the an-
nual, was unable to attend.

The Conference opened at two o'clock
Thursday afternoon with the registra-
tion of delegates, This lasted until six.
There followed the first of a series of
three banquets and dances which were
given during the week-end at Hotel
Sheraton, the Conference headquarters.

The business session began at nine the
next morning with the appointment of
various committees. After this the mem-
bers were divided into four. groups—the
editors of annuals entering one group,
editors of college papers another, and
editors of magazines a third, with the
business managers of all types of pub-
lications, forming one.

Among the editorial groups the dis-
cussion dealt mainly with the many
problems encountered in the editorship of
college publications, and ways and means
of meeting them. The business mana-
gers considered various methods of fi-
nancing, and, in view of increased print-
ing costs, the possibility of a proportion-
ate increase in advertising rates was dis-
cussed.

A number of experienced newspaper-
men addressed the body on different
phases of journalistic work and writing,
among them Mr. Beck, of Edwards and
Broughton, Raleigh, and Mr. Connor, of
The High Point Lnterprise.

Luncheons were given for the dele-
gates Friday and Saturday, and a
banquet and dance on each of the cor-
responding evenings. The business meet-
ings were brought to a close Saturday by
the decision to hold the spring confer-
ence in Greensboro, where N. C. C. W.
will act as hostess to the Association.

Officers of the organization, which now
represents all colleges in the state, in-
cluding Queens-Chicora, N. C. C. W., and
Greensboro College, are: Larry Martin,
of N. C. State, president; ‘Thompson
Greenwood, of Wake Forest, vice-presi-
dent, Norman B. Livingood, of Duke
University, treasurer, and Catherine
Hines, Eastern Carolina ‘Teachers
College, secretary.

The Davidson delegation was forced
to leave the conference early returning
Friday evening on account of the Home-
coming festivities on the Davidson
campus.

First Edition Of Yow!
’ Appears November 8th

on

of

The much awaited “Yow,” Davidson’s
one and only humor magazine, made its
appearance on the campus last Thursday
to the delight of a joke-hungry Student
Body and dispelled all hope that “The
Davidsonian” was displacing “The Yowl”
as Davidson's most humorous publica-
tion.

Several humorous short stories, a
number of original jokes and the draw-
ings made the first 1934-35 edition /the
funniest since the days of D. D. Mc-
Bryde. The art work drew especial
praise from student readers and was, as
many expressed it, the best department
in. the magazine. On the art staff are
Collier Ellis and Howell Overton, sopho-
mores; Calloway, Ryburn and Vowles,
freshmen.

Cameron Deans and Tom Wood sup-
plied the poetry, other than doggerel,
and Gibson Smith, Richard Vowles and
John Anderson were the major short
story writers.

Editor Lorenzo McPhail’ and his. staff
of four managing editors and twenty-
two assistants are now recuperating
from their violent efforts to manufacture
wit and, about the life of a humor writer,
all agree that “It’s a great life if you
don’t weaken.”

His Views On Music

“Do you think radio is helping music
or harming it?”

“T believe that, although it harms it to
a certain extent, in the end it helps to
maké music more universally appreciated.
It brings good although not
enough, to every type of individual. Of
course, it keeps a certain clement from
concerts, but on the other hand, it excites
an interest in music that draws another
element to the concerts. All in all, I be-

“How do you compare the organ, your

own instrument, with other instruments?”

“The organ is, in my opinion, the
greatest instrument because of its wide
variety of tonal effects. Of course, to
be played with best results, it must be in
a room with proper acoustics. The ma-
jority of laymen do not realize this. They
assume that, if there are no visible pipes,
the total mechanism is located in the
console.”

“What type of audience is most ap-
preciative? How does the college au-
dience compare with the general au-
dience ?”

“T really can’t say as to that. Au-
diences do not vary greatly as a whole.

Carolina Pep Meeting
Most Spirited Of Year

The best attended ed and t the most spirited
pep meeting of the year was held last
Friday night in anticipation of the annual
Davidson-Carolina football game which
was played Saturday, resulting in Caro-
lina winning a hard fought battle 12-2.

Joe Johnston, of Barium Springs, was
the principal speaker. He made sev-
eral clever puns on the names of various
D. C, football men bringing out the su-
periority of our men over the Tar Heels.

All Freshmen were at the pep rally
and at least«two hundred upperclassmen
were there to contribute volume to the
yells attempted. A number of Carolina
students were also present.

The first year men, after a series of
yells which were given in Shearer Hall,
were lined up in single file and with
shirt tails out were lead by the cheer
leaders in a so-called shirt tail parade,
through the “D” and over to the Fresh-
man field where a bon-fire was burning
brightly. The freshmen formed a circle
and did a prolonged snake dance around
the fire. A number of cheers were given
after which the pep-meeting was brought
to an end.
