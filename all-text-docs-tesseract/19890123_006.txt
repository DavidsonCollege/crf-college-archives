They narrated on American ap-
pearances, habits and national
politics. Apparently we all tend to
be loud, obnoxious, but friendly.
A Scot could spot an American
from miles away by the inevitable
turtleneck.

Many of
these obser-
vations were
also ex-
pressed in a
pub. Usually,
the pubs
would fill up
around lunch
and empty at

become
crowded

after dinner.
Every subject

age by an
equally di-
verse group of
people. .

Old men in
kilts drank
drams_ while
arguing the
latest football
game. Their
accents
verged on the
point of creating a foreign lan-
guage from English. “Dinna
shougil noo, lassie!” one man
warned me as I jogged his elbow,
afraid I'd spill his drink. =~

Pubs acted as the great melting
pot of University life; after or be-
fore classes, students would al-
ways be at the closest

friends, sterotypes become as elu-
sive as the Loch Ness Monster.

It’s great to be back at

and have a story to tell, submit

it to The Davidsonian by Monday night, preferably on disk.
