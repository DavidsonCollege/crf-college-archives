Davidson Wildcats
Bow to Catawba

Collect Eight Hits to Catawba’s
Four But Scatter Them Out

Filling the date left open by the failure
of Oak Ridge to play at Davidson, the
Catawba College Indians upset the dope
by nosing out Monk Younger’s Wildcats
here Friday, March 22. The score 3-2
indieates the closeness of the battle and
the-fact that the game was well played for
the s@ason’s “opener.
McInnis, Younger’s choice to start the
game, was wild as the proverbial March
Hare in the initial frame, and his gener-
osity coupled with Littlejohn’s error and
a safe blow by one of the visiting bats-
men enabled the Indians to chalk up three
runs as a starter. From this juncture
on, McInnis pitched excellent ball, show-.
ing some of the form which earned him
a reputation last year as a consistent win-
ner. Later, when Buck Marrow, sopho-
more star, took up the burden, he con-
tinued the good work and limited the visi-
tors to one bingle in four frames.
The Wildcats tried hard to knot the
count, but were not able to bunch their
hits on White, elongated supthpaw of the
Catawba team. For four frames, the
portsider baffled the locals, and it was
only through his teammates’ miscues that
the Cats were able to sneak a pair of
runs across on White in the fifth canto.
With two men down, and the stage set
for the Wildcats to tie the count, Captain
Ratchford overran third base and was
tagged out as the ball took a freakish
hop into the third sacker’s hands.
Davidson looked woefully weak at the
batting side of the argument. Though
the Cat swatsmiths were able to gather
eight safe blows to their opponents four,
they lost the contest because they were
unable to bunch these hits.

Hardre to Address
Le Cercle Francais

French Life and Customs is Topic
of Illustrated Lecture

Dr. G. B. Watts, of the French depart-
ment announced that Prof. Rene
Hardre, native Frenchman and professor
of French at N. C. C. W., has consented
to address the Circle Francais here short-
ly after the holidays.

It is remembered that Prof. Harde
addressed an interested’ audience here last
year, speaking on “Impressions as a stu-
dent in a French Boarding School,” the
lecture being illustrated with beautiful
posters. Although his subject has not
been announced it is thought that he will
again speak on some phase of French
life and also illustrate his lecture with
posters.

Prof. Hardre was recently named “Offi-
cier d’Acadamie,” which is quite an honor
for a man of Prof. Hardre’s age. Before
coming to N. C. C. W., Prof. Hardre was
a member of the faculty at Middlebury
College, Vt.

LITERARY SOCIETIES

Eumenean

The Eumenean Literary Society ad-
journed its regular meeting the night- of
Tuesday, March 18, in order to enable its
memtfrs*to hear Senor Motena Lacardo.
Philanthropic

The subject for debate in the Phi Soci-
ety was Resolved: That Class Insignia
Should Be Worn Only After the Com-
pletion of the First Term of the Junior
Year. The affirmative team composed of
E, E. Clark and S. W. DuBose, received
the verdict over negative, supported by
A. G. Randolph and Cecil Lawrence.

A declamation was given by Lon Carr
after which the Society adjourned for a
feed.

VIEWS AND OBSERVATION

educational contribution should be greater,
and it should become known and placed in
the same category as Princeton.

One of the most outstanding church
leaders believed that scientific develop-
ment should be fostered and abetted by
church schools, and that such a solution
of the present status of some institutions
who were being overwhelmed by new
thought could be eliminated if the chtirch
schools would act as a stabilizer by ac-
cepting scientific ideas. The spiritual
side of the church school, it was con-
tended, acted as a balance for the new
thought. “Emphasize learning,” he said,
“and you will have a combination of the
spiritual and educational at Davidson.”

“What percentage of the student body
at Davidson is entertaining the educa-
tional world for the sake of education it-
self?” was another question asked. No
Statistics are available, but an examina-
tion of the hundreds of students who
are now attending institutions of higher
learning reveals only a few men who
plan to their lifetime to the
promulgation of education, or to do re-
search in the scientific and educational
fields, It seemed to be a universal feel-
ing in this meeting that Davidson should
inspire her students to pursue such
courses,

devote

Gratification was expressed over the
recent action of the board of trustees,
accepting Dr. Martin’s recommendation
for an endowment of the library. Its
limited number of volumes at the present
time prevents any elaborate parallel study,
and when Davidson students see the
libraries of Columbia, Harvard and Johns
Hopkins, they realize how handicapped
they were at Davidson. “It has been a
pitiful condition,” was the way one alum-
nus expressed it.

After invitation extended to
the alumni at one meeting to return for
commencement, one man said that he had
been prevented each year. because the
Davidson commencement was so early.
Many others: expressed regret that they
could not retirn, for their sessions ended
about the time the Davidson commence-
ment period was ending. It was suggested
that the college open the third Wednes-
day in September, instead of the second.
It is believed that between fifty and
one hundred men who could not other-
wise be, here, would return. It’s im-
portant, too, to get the alumni back to
the campus as often as possible.

Alumni in most of the cities were in-
terested in the Davidson football team
which plays the Army on October. 12th,
and there seems to be no question but
that the Wildcats will have many loyal
supporters at West Point next fall. Capt.
Weems, former head of the R. O. T. C.
department, attended the New York meet-
ing, and extended an invitation to the
alumni there. It was relayed to others
by the secretary at Capt. Weems’ solicita-
tion. Arrangements are being made for

Admiring Father Drops
Line to His Dear Son

My Dear Son:

Your scholastic standings for the
initial semester of your first year at
college are at hand. Despite five years
of like records during your high school
period they afford me no small thrill.
I take this opportunity to extend con-
gratulations, for your ability to remain
in college is nothing short of an art.
In some ways, my boy, you are a
genius. The masterly manner in which
you expend but the minimum of physi-
cal and mental energy in any field you
undertake marks you efficient to a de-
cided degree. And should you ever—
from indications this might come to
pass—come bounding home quite un-
expectedly, I assure you that you will
find ample chance to express your offi-
cient tendencies in and about the barns
of the farm that I own some miles
west of this city.

You, no doubt, felt it unnecessary
to write home and explain how you
attained the marks you did, and in
this you are quite correct. They de-
mand no explanation, speaking quite
plainly for themselves. Of course I
realize that standings are merely the
alphabetical playthings of biased pro-
fessors and are in no way indicators of
real knowledge gained. I also remem-
ber, from long talks you gave on the
subject while attending high school,
that knowledge and learning comes
from lectures, and through textbooks.
The “C plus” you earned in physical
education was remarkable, and de-
serves praise. Having once attended
college myself know that you must
have spent many diligent hours with
your books in that course.

Your letters have been very irregular
and for that reason your mother and I
have not heard from you since you
were home mornings during the
Christmas recess. Your mother fears
that you may be in a state of ill health

Finally, the alumni secretary believes
that if the alumni continue to manifest
the same kind of interest in their Alma
Mater, as was so evident in the recent
Series of meetings, the future welfare
of the college is assured—both edica-
tionally and financially.

’

from too conscientious study. I have
assured her, however,,that you are in
fine mettle. Your checks, which are
in no way irregular, come in daily
signed in a firm, healthy hand and it
is through them that I am always in
contact with your physical welfare and
numerous outside activities. Offhand,
I would venture that you hold some
sort of amateur record for check writ-
ing, for a.space. of.the last four and a
half months, an achievement of which
I am constantly reminded by calls from
the cashier of the First National Bank.
This is an age when everyone must
have some record or another, out of
times I half wish that you had chosen
to distinguish yourself in another way.

Oh, yes, I almost forgot to mention a
letter from the dean of your college that
came along the same day as your marks.
Because of the wide scope of your extra-
curricular activities and also because of
the quality of your academic work you
have caused that gentleman to sit up
and take notice. He has acquired such an
interest in you that he had to write. He
told me a great deal about you in very
definite language, strangely, he differed
with you as to the real value of grades.
Deans, however, are apt to differ, other-
wise they would not be deans. So many
of their beliefs are hypothetical, although
in all fairness I must admit that your
dean’s theories on the success of your
future in college could hardly be classed
as such.

Should the factulty of your institution
fail to uphold my faith in you and act
unfavorably toward your petition on ar-
riving home you will find a pair of over-
alls in your room and a Ford out in
front waiting to take you at once out to
the farm. I might add that work along
agricultural lines is a bit difficult at pres-
end, due to a.dreath of hired hands and

a hard winter. I would suggest that
college life is at all times a little more
pleasant than rural existence, and that
you should always keep this in mind if
your impending reunion with the home
home folks falls through.

By the way, you no longer have an
account at the First National, the same
having died the proverbial nine deaths of
an alley cat, and I thought it best to let
tt remaitr dead and thus put ‘a stop to ~
the massacre. Hereafter on Monday of
each week a check will show up large
enough to keep you in books, society fees,
food, clothing, and an occasional evening
with one of the host of your feminine ad-
mirers. It would hardly be sufficient,
however, to let you continue with your
policy of buying your college in small
installments.

Should you take time from your studies
to write, our address is still the same.

—Your Admiring Father.

ENGINEERING SUBJECT

overtax them. The engineer learns
through experience the physical amount of
endurance of the human machine. The
trouble with many executives lies in the
fact that they overtax their manpower or
their department over which they are
leader. On the other hand, a former en-
gineer would study the strength of his
department and then use it to the best
advantage without overtaxation. It is
well for one to study Engineering even
if he has no intention of entering that
line of work.
