ROTCReceives
Highest Rating

Davidson Unit Receives Rating
Of Excellent

Members of the student body will
be happy to learn that the ROTC
department has again gained a rat-
ing of “excellent” in the annual
examination by representatives of
the Fourth Service command. For-
merely, the department received a
rating of “satisfactory”, due only to
the fact that it didn’t have at least
100 men in its outfit. However, since
the unit until very recently had had
over 100 men, a recent order pre-
venting units of less than 100 from
gaining ‘the excellert rating was
rescinded in this instance. Trained
by the capable leadership of Major
E. E. Marsh, professor of military
science and tactics, 91 Davidson
cadets in the various tests and in-
spections massed a total of 86.15
points out of a possible 100.
