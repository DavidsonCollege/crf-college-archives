With Baker scholarships, Davidson can compete for cream of the crop

By Mary Clare Jalonick
“Davidson already has the best stu-
dents, but with this money we will
be able to continue to attract the
best in an increasingly competitive

-environment,” says Gardner Roller
Ligo, Merit Scholarship Coordi-
nator, in reference to the $5 million
in scholarship money donated to
Davidson last week by Thompson
S. Baker.

A plan for the money has not
yet been formulated, but Ligo looks
forward to sitting down and devis-
ing one. She hopes that the money
will reward “a wide variety of stu-
dents with a variety. of skills.”

The money will most likely

go toward a flagship scholarship ,

program for entering freshmen.
Such a program will draw atten-
tion to the school and give recipi-

ents more money than Davidson
has ever been able'to offer. It will
also enable the college to offer
more scholarships for special in-
ternships, international experi-
ences, and mentorships.

Nancy Cable Wells, Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid, says
that with the creation of the Baker
scholarships, “Davidson has firmly
established itself in the arena of
highly competitive institutions.”

Other new scholarships

In addition to the Baker schol-
arships, several other new merit
scholarships have been established
this year. The most prominent of
these are the Will Terry scholar-
ships; these $15,000 four-year
scholarships will be awarded to
two incoming freshmen who excel
in leadership and academics.

Other new additions to the
program include the Rosmarie
Bearden scholarship, which pro-
vides $10,000 a year for two Afri-
can-American students majoring
in the visual arts, and the Cato-
McFarland Jenkins scholarship,
which provides $3,000 annually
for women interested in business
careers.

The growing merit-based
program

Regarding recruiting top-level
students, Ligo says that Davidson
“is not in the business of buying
students, but inviting their inter-
ests. If Davidson is the best match
for a student, then we would like to
open the door a little farther for
them.”

- Roughly 10% of each enter- -

ing class is awarded a merit schol-

arship. In addition to merit and
leadership-based scholarships,
need-based general merit scholar-
ships are awarded. Awards for
special skills, such as creative writ-
ing or excellence in the fine arts,
are also distributed.

Students must apply for the
most prestigious scholarships.
Some of the more prominent schol-
arships include the Patricia
Cornwell Prize for excellence in
writing, the Dow Chemical Com-
pany Foundation Scholarship for
possible chemistry majors, the Pep-
per Merit Scholarship in studio art,
and the Williams Challenge schol-
arships for students considering
the ministry.

Although most merit scholar-
ships goto entering freshmen, there
are a few granted to currently en-

rolled students. The Stuart Schol-
arship, recognizing academic
strength and leadership in four ris-
ing juniors, is one of these scholar-
ships. Also, several departmental
scholarships exist based on excel-
lence in a particular fields.

Dean of Admissions Nancy
Cable Wells is particularly excited
about the Class of ’94 senior class
gift, which establishes a fund that
will reward merit and need based
scholarships. With 100% partici-
pation, the gift will grow each year
and continue to give for posterity.

With new money coming in
each year, the merit scholarship
program is becoming one of the
most competitive in the state. Ligo
sums up the department in a sen-
tence: “We are not here to buy, but
to encourage and provide access.”

Former history professor Shi selected Furman President

By Wendy Lee

Former Davidson history pro-
fessor David Shi has been named
president of Furman University in
Greenville, South Carolina.

Shi, 42, left Davidson last year
to take the position of Vice-Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs at
Furman and will officially begin
his presidency June 1.

During Shi’s 17 years at
Davidson, he was the Frontis W.
Johnston Professor of History and
served as the department chair from
1987 to 1992. He was the 1982
recipient of the ODK Teaching
Award,

“Furman’s future is so bright’

that it burns. my eyes merely to
envision it,” Shi said in an address
to the Furman community follow-
ing his appointment to the presi-
dency.

Davidson history professor
Malcolm Partin called Shi a “20th

century American intellectual and
cultural historian” and “a man of
rare energy and ability.” Partin
added, “I am not surprised that he
should become president of
Furman. He will do a wonderful
job.”

Todd Haynie, a senior history
major, took two classes with Shi
and said, “Dr. Shi was the best
professor I’ve had since I’ ve been
here at Davidson. The way he
deals with students will make him
a successful president. He’ll be
well respected and will do a great
job.”

Partin commended Shi for

“helping” to" int Oauce“the senibt’“}-""

colloquium and Kelly Program into
the Davidson history department.
Shi, a 1973 graduate of
Furman, said, “It is a special privi-
lege to be summoned by my alma
mater.

South Carolina’s flagship private
college, Furman is on the thresh-
old of being one of the country’s
most distinguished liberal arts col-
leges.”

Furman’s current president,
Dr. John E. Johns said, “I can truth-
fully say there is no one I would
rather have succeed me than David
Shi. He will make a great presi-
dent and a thoughtful spokesman

for higher education.”

About Furman’s future, Shi
said, “We are going to continue to
promote what I call the new liberal
arts, encouraging students not only
to study a wide range of disci-
plines, but also to apply the prin-
ciples of liberal learning in a prac-
tical way, either through aresearch
project, an internship, or a study
abroad experience.”
