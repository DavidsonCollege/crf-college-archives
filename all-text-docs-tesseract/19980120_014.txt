Can this really be “As Good as it Gets”?

By Ep Pace
Staff Writer

Jack Nicholson asks this open question to
those in the waiting room of his psychiatrist and
thus explains the movie. Is the way your life is
right now really as good as it gets? I think we’ve
all been told that these are supposed to be the best
years of our lives. If that’s true, then why go on?
“ AsGood As It” Gets gives a sense of why and that
it’s up to us when we’ ve peaked.

The movie opens strongly with Melvin Udall
harassing everyone he can with all those things
that are politically incorect to say and keeps us
laughing while he does it. This movie keeps its
pace and the laughs moving along throughout the
film. This is not the formulaic love story we’ve
come to know and love from Hollywood, but
rather a quirky deeper love story that also ques-
tions our own roles in life.

James Brooks’ (who co-wrote and directed
the film) prime invention here is Melvin Udall
(Jack Nicholson). A hilarious misanthrope, Melvin
is such a versatile bigot that he gets in lots of

mileage without even leaving home. There’s just
something about Nicholson that makes you want
to grin. He’s the guy who knows the angles.
Melvin Udall is a
richromancenov- °
elist whose relent-
less irascibility is
only partly attrib-
utable to an ob-
sessive-compul-
sive disorder,
He’s ground out
62 romance nov-
els for women.
When a fan asks
him how he writes
the female char-
acters so convincingly, he replies, “I think of a
man. And I take away reason and accountability.”
The other half-of this love story is Helen
Hunt. Hunt is a single mom who waitresses at the
Manhattan eatery where Nicholson chows down
daily. Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) worries about
the health of her asthmatic young son while toler-

ating Melvin in fond, vinegary fashion. “When I
first saw you, when you first came in to breakfast,
I thought you two were handsome,” she eventually

tells him. “Then,
of course, you
spoke.” How

little help from

Kinnear), figure

seeking.

Helen Hunt gets high marks for holding her
own against so much star power. Hunt matches
Nicholson growl for growl and arched eyebrow
for arched eyebrow. She gives a tough, touching
performance and is simply splendid.

Kinnear as Simon Bishop turns in a much .

deeper and better role that he did in the 1995
remake of “Sabrina.” He is the one who helps
these two along and counterbalances Melvin’s
hatred of people. Simon’s line, “If you stare at
someone long enough, you start to see their hu-
manity,” shows his sensitivity and faith in people.

James Brooks’ characters are never, ever ata
loss for words. Nobody does a better job of
backing characters into happiness than Brooks,
especially when those characters are high-strung
enough to leave happiness practically out of the
question. The film’s sourness turns sweet when it
becomes clear where Brooks is heading. “As
Good As It Gets” turns out to be about love and its
ability to redeem the seemingly irredeemable.

This movie is by far one of the top five I’ve
seen in recent years. It and “L. A. Confidential”
are my two favorites. from the past year. This is
one time that the more and more I analyze and
think about it I come to love it even more. This
movie can be enjoyed without delving deeper than
the relationship on screen, but if you do reach
farther, it’s even better. Grade: A+. Running
time: 130 minutes. Rated PG13.

Robert Morgan keeps it real in the 900 Room

By Ep ANDERSON
Staff Writer

Robert Morgan read selections
from both his most recent anthology,
Green River , and his new novel, The
Truest Pleasure, in the 900 Room this
past Thursday.

Morgan grew up on a farm in the
Blue Ridge Mountains here in North
Carolina. After studying first at UNC-
Chapel Hill and then UNCGreensboro,
he went through a succession of odd
jobs that culminated in his current posi-
tionas a Professor of English at Cornell.

His writing has garnered him
awards and fellowships aplenty and
comparisons to Robert Frost and Gerard
Manley Hopkins (on the back of his
book, anyway). He is also Davidson’s
current McGee Professor of Writing.

I knew I was drowsy when I came
to hear Robert Morgan speak. I took a
seat by some friends in the front row,
immediately in front of the podium. It
was my hope that by placing myself
directly in the path of what I believed to
be an imminent steamroller of poetic
intensity, I would remain awake. I even
dared hope that I might be so affected
by his words that I would find myself
more aware afterwards.

I settled in, steeling myself against
the impending inception of Morgan’s
oratorical onslaught. Much to my cha-
grin, the figure who stepped to the mic
was not very imposing at all. There
could be no mistake; the emcee had

done the deed, and this was Mr. Robert

Morgan live and in person in the 900 «

room. .

Yet the man in front of me was
understated in every sense of the word,
every particle of his being less than
you'd expect. Less of an accent, less of
a dynamic voice, less an eccentric, less
of a presence. His reading style was
that of a very disinterested preacher,
regurgitating an accurate but insubstan-
tial picture of events past.

His one, solitary quirk was that he
gave no vocal indication of reaching the
end of a poem, either by inflection or
tone. After his first poem was over, he
continued straight into commentary
about the next one, which I thought was
pretty hep at first, making the whole
shebang into a beat monologue. But
then I realized that the poem proper had
ended, and again, I was expecting some-
thing that wasn’t there.

One of the first poems he read,
“Lightning Bug,” was an effort’of 15
years, but for me it captured only an
instant of the near-endless wonder I
recalled from my own childhood. .

Sitting on my porch at the end ofa
summer day, the tiny lights would
emerge from the inky depths of the
backyard jungle of shrubbery. It was as
if someone had poured them into. my
yard and stirred the air. Chasing them
was fruitless, but if I could restrain
myself to ‘stillness long enough, one
might light upon my outstretched hand
for amoment. Some of this was to be

found in Mr. Morgan’s poem, and so I
was reassured that there was a possibil-
ity I might be intrigued by more of his
work.

Unfortunately, his writing is rooted

so deeply in his own past that even if it ,

only serves as a context for his mes-
sage, it obscures the necessary connec-
tion between his mind and mine.

As much as I wanted to be inter-
ested, I[couldn’t find the strand of mean-
ing to hold on to. The language he uses
is intricate and his poems are well-
crafted, but they paint a picture that is
flat for me. .I have not lived his life, and
thus I do not have the associations that
make his work breathe.

Perhaps I did not try hard enough,
but I found nothing remarkable about
his recollection of his father mowing
the lawn. Admittedly, I felt I could see
him quite clearly cutting the grass, but
it was not that different from my own
memories of attempted horticultural
genocide.

Poetry shouldn’t necessarily be
about novelty, but it can be about ex-
panding one’s mind, and I found this
poetry fell short in this regard. So,
while there is a great deal I think one
could learn about how to write good
poetry - or even fiction - from Morgan,
I was a bit disappointed by his reading.

I do hope that he comes back,
especially since I think if I could hear
more of his stories, his work might
begin to take on the life it was meant to
have.
