Solidarity committee wants to continue the
dream here at Davidson

BY HEATH HARDAGE
When the Ku Klux Klan marched
through the town of Davidson in 1984,

sophomore Michelle Blake, issued an
ambitious statement of purpose this
fall: “Desiring fewer divisions in the

concerned stu-
dents spon-
sored a march
to protest the
presence of the
Klan and its
ideals.

Since then,

many more ef-
forts to combat
racism have
been made on
campus. A
more formal
committee
was appointed
in 1989 by the
Student Gov-
ernment Asso-
ciation.

Hicks ac-
knowledged
that racism is
indeed present
at Davidson.

However,. he
said, “The dem-
onstration of ra-
cism is subtle.
It’s so subtle
that a lot of stu-
dents in the ma-
jority don’t rec-
ognize it.” He

as “a lack of understanding of one an-
other that leads to feelings of alienation
among those notin the majority group.”

Hicks commented that combatting
racism is not solely the responsibility of
the Black Student Coalition because it
affects all students. “Our goals are
ambitious. Our ultimate goal is to make
everyone comfortable at Davidson Col-
lege.”

Other goals of the committee include
trying to promote communication and
understanding and to increase aware-
ness about Martin Luther King, Jr.
“He’s sucha respected leader of the civil
rights movement. Wethinkhis message
canbe applied to Davidson ina positive
way,” said Hicks.

The Solidarity Committee sponsored
the “Renew the Dream” program, a
celebration of the life and message of
King.

A commemorative service was held
Sunday evening at Davidson College
Presbyterian Church. Chaplain Chuck
Hasty and five other students spoke in
commemoration of King and how his
message applies to Davidson College.

Monday, King’s birthday, included a
30-hour prayer vigil, which ended

Tuesday at noon. A sign-up sheet was
posted in Chambers for theevent. Hicks
noted, “It’s not just the black students
who signed up, it’s students of all races
and groups.”

Hicks said that the Renew the Dream
program “stems from a problem, but
it’s looking for a solution.”

The committee also supports the
Cultural Arts Series/Black History
Month calendar of events to be held
throughout January and February.

Scheduled events now include
distinguished speakers, suchas Harvey
Gantt, the first black mayor of Char-
lotte, and last Sunday’s Gospel Choir
Songfest which featured singers from
Davidson College, as well as from local
church choirs. Also scheduled is a
showing of the controversial Spike Lee
film, Do The Right Thing; WDAV radio
programs honoring African-Ameri-
cans; and a visit from poet Lucille
Clifton, Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fel-
low.

The committee itself plans to sponsor
“one big, solid event for the community
and campus later in the spring,” said
Hicks. This event will include a guest
speaker or entertainment.

were the words of Samuel
Maloney, professor of reli-
gion, as he delivered the ad-
dress at last Tuesday’s Elev-

Classes at Davidson contin-
ued on Monday, the birthday
of civil rights martyr Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. The
day did not go unnoticed,
however. On an individual
level, and even collectively,
some Davidson students, fac-
ulty and administrators re-
membered King’s dream and
others who died striving fora
more just United States of
America.

Tuesday's Eleventh Hour
was the last leg of the 30-hour
prayer vigil sponsored by the
SGA Solidarity Committee in
honor of King.

the Black Power Movement
and the Black Muslimsas well,

did not change the opinion
nor the agenda of the white
power structure in the least.

Maloney recounted his ex-
periences as a minister of a
church in very segregated
Robinson County, NC. during
the 50's.

“I preached on racial
themes and on justice,” he
said, explaining that the
South’s racist principles were
foreign to him, a minister who
grew up in California, New
York and Rhode Island.
Maloney helped organize a
county-wide interracial min-
isterial association, which at-
tracted approximately 10
whites, 10 blacks and 8 Indi-
ans.

That activity, added to his
visits to black churches and
colleges, earned him criticism
which he stated were more
humorous than harmless.

was painful in some respects.
“Yet it was not as painful as
having two laws was for

Dinkins, newly-elected mayor

of New York City) and have —

that advancements have been
made in widening opportuni-

Maloney.

Racism is not gone, he said,
but in the past decade poverty
has emerged as the greatest-
menace to well-being in this
society.

“We need another King...to

he concluded.
