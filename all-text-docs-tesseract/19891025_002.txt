Open forum addresses resurgence of racism

By GEORGE LAFAYE

The Black Student Coali-
tion presented an Open Forum
discussion titled “Racism in
America: Answers to the Prob-
lem” in the 900 Room last week
to address what is seen as a re-
surgence in racially motivated
incidents and racist attitudes in
this country.

Five Davidson students,
freshmen Rafael Candelario, a
graduate of Davidson’s Love of
Learning program, and An-
thony Foxx; sophomore Lind-
say Mills; and seniors Michacl
Brooks and Michelle Serrano;
along with Jamaal Harut, a
freshman from Barber-Scotia,
made up the panel which ad-
dressed questions posed by
Assistant Dean of Students
William Bynum.

Bynum opened the discus-
sion in front of about 150 audi-
ence members with an intro-
duction drawing parallels be-
tween the status of blacks in
modern America with the situ-
ation near the end of the Re-
construction period following
the Civil War.

“Not since the enactment
of the Jim Crow laws and the
murderous acts of the Ku Klux
Klan have we seen the number
and viciousness of racially mo-
tivated incidents as we have
witnessed in the last five
years,” he said.

Bynum pointed out that
there had been “racially moti-
vated incidents on the cam-
puses of the nation’s suppos-
edly premier colleges,” as well
as incidents like the riot this
past summer in Virginia Beach
involving black students and
the National Guard.

BSC President Brooks
placed some of the blame for
the problem on the Reagan
administration. Brooks said
the administration “shot down
a lot of programs which were
aimed at increasing funds for
black education,” and welfare.
He sees the result of these ac-
tions as sending a message to
white Americans that “we
don’t have to worry about ra-
cism anymore,” and to blacks,
the idea that,”the President of
our country is saying that it’s
OK for people to oppress us.”

While most members of
the panel agreed that more
racially motivated incidents
have been reported in recent
years, some took exception

with the assumption that the
problem hadever truly waned.
“These specific events are the
ones that have been in national
attention,” said Mills, who
serves as vice-president of the
BSC. “Racism has been
around,” he said, “ever since
400 years ago when black
slaves were brought over to
build this country.”

Foxx echoed this opinion.
“When you say something has
resurged,” he said, “itassumes
that thing has been gone.”

Candelario feels that racist
attitudes have been in -the
minds of people, but the cur-
rent political and social atmos-
pheres have allowed those feel-
ings to come into the open.
“Racism has always been

~ around and--the-Reagan-ad- -

ministration let it come back
out,”he said.

Serrano discussed the Vir-
ginia Beach incident; she was
at the beach when the riot oc-
curred. Placing blame on local
shop owners and residents for
creating a tense atmosphere,
she said, “the local shop own-
ers wanted the event moved
because they felt threatened.”
This tense atmosphere led the
city to prepare for problems.
“Any little incident was going
to be reacted upon,” she said.

Before the forum was
opened to audience participa-
tion, Harut presented what
would prove to be the most
controversial ideas of the
night. First he redefined the
terms of the discussion. “The
word racism is a myth to me.
Racism to me means white
supremacy, which runs this
country,” he said. The reason
for this problem, he said, is
caused by “a deep, inrooted
fear. If you look at history you
can see where that fear is com-
ing from.”

Harut | said,
people have the problem, and
if we want to do anything
about so-called racism we have
to start getting together.”

This position proved con:
troversial once the floor was
yielded to the audience. When
one listener asked, “By every-
one getting together, you do
mean black and white?” Harut
said, “No. I don’t say that to

‘offend, but you as a European -

can use your racism to hold
blacks back.” Harut sees the
solution coming from blacks.

“African |

“You've got to start with your-
self, and we have to start with
ourselves,” he said. —

The focus of the discussion
then moved to the racial cli-
mate at Davidson itself. Most
of the panel felt that it is hard
for a black person to feel com-
fortable -here. Candelario
pointed out that after just
seven weeks of class, “I’m in
the process of filling out trans-
ferapplications, and I willsend
the first one out tomorrow.”

Brooks believes that be-
cause the school has a Board of
Trustees with only two black
members, a small number of
black faculty members and
students, plus the lack of a his-
torically black fraternity, it is
hard for black students to de-

velop a sense of community) at>::

Davidson.
He placed some of the
blame on an _ unresponsive

administration, commenting
that racial problems are fre-
quently pointed out to the
administration. “Every year,”
he said, “a group of students
will present a list of problems
and solutions to the President
or the Board of Trustees, and
every year promises are made,
and every year the problems
remain unsolved.”

The panel took care to
point out that, in their minds,
racism isa white on black prob-
lem. Brooks said, “racism to
me is the oppression of a mi-
nority by a majority.” Cande-

lariosaid, “I think thatracismis:

not taught in many black
homes.” Also,adistinction was
made by Mills between racism,
which he seesas the restraint of
anindividual or group because

of race, and prejudice, which

means having ideas about a
group. “Prejudice doesn’t

have to have a negative conno-
tation,” he said.

The panel concluded the
evening by proposing solu-
tions to the problem of racism
in the nation and at Davidson.
Brooks said that “grass roots
have been in vain, and change
has to come from the top,”
while Harut said; “Self-deter-

‘mination and knowledge are
what Africans need.”

Bynum summarized the
solutions needed at Davidson.
“We need a black fraternity, an
African Studies major or con-
centration, more money for
minority recruitment, more
black Trustees, more black fac-
ulty, even if that means getting
into a bidding war with other
schools to show that we are
committed. We need more
programs like Love of Learn-
ing to attract a more diverse
student body.”

By KATHERINE COOKE

U.S. News and World Re-
port published its 1990 Col-
lege Guide on October 16. The
guide isa rank order listing of
the top colleges and universi-
ties in the nation. Davidson
was ranked 15th in the cate-
gory of national liberal arts
colleges, up from 20th last
year.

This move up was not a
big surprise to Robert Gard-
ner, Dean of Admissions.
Gardner said, “I expected us
tomoveup because I knew we
had a strong admissions
year.”

When determining the
rank, five categories are taken
into consideration: quality of
student body, strength of the
faculty, financial resources,

What the U.S. News & World
Report ranking means to us

retention rate and percent of
students graduated and aca-
demic reputation. The final
‘Standing is then determined
by the school’s total percent-
age when the individual
scores are compiled.

Out of the 141 national
liberal-arts colleges rated,
Davidson was judged sixth
for retention and ninth for
selectivity. It was also
judged 22nd for financial
resources, 23rd for aca-
demic reputation and 31st
for quality of faculty.

All of these scores com-
bine to give Davidson an
overall score of 80.5. This
made us the 15th national
liberal-arts college, and the

top one in the south.

Gardner says the main

excellence. Retention‘and se-

problem with the system is
that it is difficult to quantify
and rank something like fac-
ulty’ strength ‘and academic

lectivity can be measured
statistically, but it isn’t as
simple to judge the strength
of one school’s faculty
against another’s,

But what does all of this
mean for Davidson? Accord-
ing to Gardner, the rank is a
useful tool for students and
parents when choosing a col-
lege.

“It is difficult to judge
colleges on your own,” he
said, “and even though this
guide can’t tell each prospec-
tive student which college is
the right one for him or her,
it’sbetter than nothing atall.”
