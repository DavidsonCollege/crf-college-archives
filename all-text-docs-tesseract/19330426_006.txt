Davidson Baseball Team
Defends Big Five Lead

Batting Averages

Davidson has a big chance in scoring high
in the individual averages of the Big Five
teams. Mackorell leads the Wildcat aggre-
gation with a batting average of .382. Da-
vidson has an especially good hitting team
this year, and will run the boys in the Big
Five a close race if not outrun them.

Morris and Mills have led the field in runs
considering the number of hits they have.
These two have 10 runs out of 11 hits and
9 runs out of 10 hits, respectively. The re-
maining three, Morgan, Morrison, J. G., and
Peabody, are also to be commended for their
excellent hitting.

Miller Cochran Sets .
New Wildcat Record

Miller Cochran, member of the Junior
class of Davidson College, set a new record
for the varsity shotput, when he hurled the
iron ball 44 feet, 3 inchesin-the recent Da-
vidson-Wake Forest track meet.

The Davidson athletic teams will have ay

busy week during the approaching seven-|
day period. The baseball, track, tennis, and}
golf teams are all campaigning on foreign!
soil.

Monday, the linksmen took on Washing-|
ton and Lee University at Lexington, Va.
Earlier this year the ’Cats, led by the scin-
tillating play of Jack Wagner, defeated the
Generals, 11 to 7, in a match played over
the Charlotte Country Club course.

On this same day the Davidson tennis)
team is at Lexington. On this tour the
team has met with defeat at the hands of
Carolina and Navy; and has placed second
in the state championship held at Durham.

Tuesday finds the Davidson diamond ag-
gregation, Big Five leaders, swinging into
action against the Tar Heels of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, who they have
already handed two 4 to 3 lickings. . The
Carolina boys will be out for blood, and the
game will have a bearing on the state race.
Southpaw Pearce will probably face the
Chapel Hill lads,

The tennis team is at William and Mary
on this day. Davidson has not met the In-
dians before, and they have a team highly
spoken of.

Continuing their Virginia tour, the David-
son golfers will encounter the University
of Richmond over the sporty James River
course, Richmond, Va.. The Spiders are the
team that handed the ’Cats such a thor-
ough lacing in the first match of the season.

On Wednesday, Coach Flake Laird will
probably send George Baily to tame the
claws of the Wolfpack of N. C. State at
Raleigh. State has played two Big Five
contests and lost to Wake Forest by a count
of 12 to 1, and Duke, 5 to 0,

Thursday, Davidson’s representatives are
idle, but on Friday the golf team whips into
action at the Valley Brook course of the
Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro,
against Duke University’s state champion
Blue Devils.

Davidson’s track,team treks southward on
Saturday to have a meet in Columbia with
the representatives of the University of
South Carolina. Davidson’s track team risks
a perfect record in this ‘meet. Captain
Fleagle is yet to meet defeat this season in
either of his specialties, the century and the
furlong. The ’Cats are especially strong in
the weight events.

An undefeated freshman track squad will
‘also take into the Palmetto State, where
they will encounter, Presbyterian College
freshmen in a meet at Clinton, S. C. The
Blue Stockings have a strong aggregation,
and the P. C. lads are expected to furnish
plenty of opposition for the local yearlings.

- The teacher is justified by his scholars.—

This is Cochran’s second year-on the var-
y cinder outfit, and he represents the col-
ge in the three weight events, the shotput,
and the discus and javelin throws. In the
meet with Wake Forest he threw the discus
over 130 feet, but stepped out of the ring,
thereby disqualifying the throw. This would
have broken the college record in the discus
throw.

Cochran is the son of Captain F. M. Coch-
ran, professor of Military Science and Tac-
tics at Davidson, and is a member of Theta

’Kittens Beat Belmont
Abbey 2-0 in Good Game

The freshmen chalked up a neat win in
defeating Belmont Abbey 2 to 0 Tuesday,
April 11, at Belmont. This victory snapped
a losing streak of three games for the ’Kit-
tens. The game was close from the out-
set, but the Davidson team showed supe-
riority in every department and clearly won
the contest.

Jenkins, on the mound for the frosh,
pitched masterful ball throughout, allowing
only two hits. However, he was aided by
some snappy fielding by his mates. Ab
Cumbie turned in the fielding gem of the
day late in the game with none out and a
man on first. He came in fast to take a
short fly back of second and. then made a
perfect throw to Burns at first to wipe out
another man. All of the team was playing
heads-up ball and deserved their victory.

In striking out 12 more men in this game,
Jenkins brought his total up to 28 for the
season. There was no outstanding hitter
for the Wildkittens, due to the effectiveness
of the Abbey hurler. Nevertheless, in this
win the freshmen showed a complete rever-
sal of form,-and, if they continue this pace,
they are destined to go places in their dia-
mond work.

HINES TOURNEY FAVORITE

Damp Weather Mars the Playing of
the Final Matches

Wilmer Hines, Carolina star and former
national junior champion, defeated Jimmy
Halverstadt, Davidson, to capture the inter-
collegiate tennis championship of North Car-
olina. The Tar Heel defeated the Wildcat
star in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.

verstadt and Charlie Myers, Davidson, 6-1,
