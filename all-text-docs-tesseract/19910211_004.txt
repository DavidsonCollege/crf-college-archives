Excerpts on Davidson From The National Review College Guide:
America’s 50 Top Liberal Arts Schools
In his book Choosing a Col- Honorable Family At Davidson, the focus of the The vast majority of the course paucity of minority candidates

lege, Thomas Sowell notes that
despite its lack ofa national repu-
tation, Davidson College has pro-
duced more students who earn
more doctorates in mathematics
than Amherst. Wellesley, Wil-
liams, or Smith - even though all
of them are larger than Davidson.
Law school deans, moreover, rank
Davidson in the top dozen schools
nationally - ahead of most Ivy
League schools - for quality of its
graduates who goonto law school.

This no news to most South-
erners. They have long recog-
nized Davidson’s outstanding
quality. But Davidson now ap-
pears to be moving into the ranks
of the nation’s elite liberal arts
colleges - a clear rival to the Ivy
League itself.

Reflecting its traditions,
Davidson proudly points to its
honor code, which it is more than
willing to compare with the legen-
dary code of Washington & Lee..
. Every entering student signs a
pledge to adhere to the code, and
by all measures, it seems to work
well, clearly alegacy of the school’s
Southern traditional of the gentle-
men.

The tradition is also reflected
in Davidgon’s work ethnic. There
are few “Mickey Mouse” courses
in Davidson curriculum and stu-
dents are expected to work long
and hard. Reading lists are exten-
sive and facutly simply assumes
that students will read the books
assigned.

Incomparable Teaching

institution remains on the class-
room, and the qulaity of teaching is
oustanding. Between 1985 and
1989 no fewer that six Davidson
professors were honored by the
Council for the Advancements and
Support of Education (CASE) for
teaching excellence.

As much as anything, this
commitment to close faculty-stu-
dent relations has defined them
apart from the mega-universities
where teaching is at bestaa second
thought, if not completely turned
over to graduate teaching assis-
tants.

More troublesome perhaps is
the still subtle, but growing em-
phaasis on“diversity.” Davidson’s
graduation requirements now in-
clude something called the “Cul-
tural Diversity Requirement”. . .

that satisfy the requirements are
solid studies of Asian culture and
language, including offerings in
Sanskrit and Vedic literature.

Immune by Tradition

We do, however, note with
some concern that Davidson has
taken a leading role in something
called the “Leadership South
Consortium for Campus Diver-
sity,” whichechoes the usual rheto-
ric of “multiculturalism” that has
been responsible for so much of
the inanity and dislocation else-
where. The school . . . appears to
be pursuing an aggressive affirma-
tiveaction policy in recruiting black
faculty members - Davidson boasts
that three of the eight professors
hired for the 1990-91 year are
African-American. Given the

and the intense competition
among the elite universities for
politically correct and creden-
tial black candidates, wecan only
wonder to whatextent Davidson
may be willing to sacrifice aca-
demic quality for “diversity.”

Butall of this seems to have
had little impact on the educa-
tion students at Davidson re-
ceive. In fact, Davidson seems
to be a classic case of a school
whose rhetoric is worse than the
reality (the reverse of the usual
situation). We think Davidson
remains a solid choice, not only
because of its traditions, but
because of a student body and
alumni whose values have been
strenghened. by. their exposure
to a genuinely fine liberal edu-
cation.

Changes To Stuart
Scholarship Program

Announced

By David Thompson

The spring of 1991 marks the
resurgence of the Edward Cross-
land Stuart Scholarship Award at
Davidson College. Although the
program has granted Stuart Schol-
arships to 49 students since 1976,
a revised application process now
changes the focus of the award.

Under the old program, a stu-
dent had to be nominated for the
scholarship by the high school from
which he or she was applying to
Davidson. The winner of theaward
was granted full tuition expenses
for the four years to be spent at
Davidson. Marlet Gibson and
Jennifer McGrady, the last of these
Stuart Scholars, will graduate in
1992. According to a brochure
publicizing the program, candi-
dates earning a Stuart Scholarship
exuded strong senses of “Christian
commitment, leadership potential,
academic achievement, and vigor-
ous outlook”.

While these qualities are still
necessary for a student to become
a Stuart Scholar, the college will
this year begin awarding the schol-
arships to qualified applicants in
the sophomore class. As it stands
now, the scholarship is “based
solely on merit, and is awarded to
rising Davidson College juniors”.
Those students who win shall re-
ceive anaward of $10,000 for their
junior year, which is renewable for
the senior year, and mustcomplete

asummer internship between their.

junior and senior years.

Each Stuart Scholar must com-
plete asummer internship which is
“an appropriate demonstration of
Christian commitment”. The Stuart
Scholarship program will offer up
to $5,000 to cover the costs of the

internship, and up to $1,200 to

assist students receiving need based
aid to comply with the summer
earings requirements of the Fi-
nancial Aid office.

While at Davidson, Edward C.
Stuart himself excelled in several
aspects of student life.. Stuart was
amember of Phi Beta Kappa, ODK.
(leadership), Beaver Club (ath-
letic), Phi Mu Alpha (musical)
YMCA cabinet, Sigma Upsilon
(literary), Sigma Delta Pi (Span-
ish), and Court of Control (student
government). Stuart spent his
junior year at American Univer-
Sity at Beirut, and served the World
Christian Youth Conference in
Travancore, India. Stuartreturned
to Davidson to become president
of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and
to graduate cum laude with a letter
in swimming.

Although he accepted a Dan-
forth Fellowship at Harvard Uni-
versity, Stuart was commissioned
by the U.S. Navy before he could
begin his studies there. His Navy
plane was lost off the coast of
Florida in February, 1956.

Unwilling to allow their friend
to be forgotten, several of Stuart’s
classmates began the Edward C.
Stuart Foundation, which, along
with other generous contributors,
provides funds for the scholarship,

Four Stuart scholarships will
be awarded to rising juniors.
Applications ‘are due on March 4,
1991, and can be obtained from
Dr. John Kelton, Executive Assis-

- tant to the President, Chambers

112. For further information,
please contact Dr. Kelton.
