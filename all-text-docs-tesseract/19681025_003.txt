Crisis, confusion and frus-

election year. Perhaps the
most confused and most frus-
trated are the generation of
‘war babies’' who are just
now old enough to vote.

candidates eliminated — one
by an assassin's bullet. the
other by a convention which
closed itself off physically as
well as mentally from their

squarely than onyone else
what Walter Lippmann has
called ‘‘the hard choice”.

The jokes about voting for
Pat Paulsen or Pigasus or
Louis Abolafia (the nudist
candidate with ‘nothing to

stale. What is left is the un
palatable choice of one of
three men,

generates fear of the con-
sequences of his leadership.

So with only 11 days until
election there are still two
unanswered questions for
many young Americans. For
whom am I going to vote
and for what good reason?

Reputation

The first question is one
of personalities. Someone is
needed to assume the
charisma which has _ been
absent from the American
political scene since 1963.
But there is no one in sight.
There is a ‘‘new Nixon’ to
be sure. but no one. is quite
certain if he is the ‘‘real’
Nixon.

The, reputation of past
political mistakes follows
him despite a truly profes.
sional job of covering up.
There is an “independent”
Humphrey who claims he
will not be tied to the mis.
takes of the administration

‘Politics Of Joy’

By WILLIAM E. JACKSON

Obviously the first test for
any new president will be
his ability to wind up the
Vietnam ‘war. Those who
argue for a Republican vic-
tory assume that Nixon will
have a better chance of ac-
complishing this than Hum-
phrey—but that is no more
than an assumption.

I would like to put the ques-
tion bluntly to those who sup-
port.Mr..Nixon: What is Nix-
on’s plan for getting us uot
of Vietnam? So far he has
been “Richard the Silent”
on this question. The answer.
of course, is that Nixon has
no plan—but he wants you
and me to think he does.

Hubert Humphrey has
some specific proposals for
peace in Vietnam that move
beyond Administration poli-
cy. He recently called for the
cessation of all bombing of
the north. period. as a step
toward peace.

What about. the claim that
Nixon can most effectively
govern in 19697 The debts
that he owes are almost all
on the conservative side of
the Republican party. Just
how high a price has been
paid to create the facade of
Republican unity that under-
Hes Nixon's claim to effec-
tive leadership? In what coin
do you pay a demagogue like
Strom Thurmond?

But there is another. and
more fundamental question,
I believe. Though a President
in part governs through his
party, he must also—to be

effective—rise above it. The
capacity for personal leader-
ship that strikes a responsive
chord in the people is ‘inde-
pendent of party strength or
party unity.

What this means is that
the selection of a president
must rest pre-eminently on
the judgment of the man not
of his party.

In conelusion, the import-
ant issues in this campaign:

1. I must return to Nixon's
choice of a vice-presidential
running mate—a man who
will be one life away from
the Presidency if Nixon is
elected. To put the question
bluntly: do we want Spiro
Agnew to be vice president
of these United States?

2. Secondly, I invite a com-
parison between Humphrey’s
approach to George Wallace
and Nixon’s approach. Mr.
Humphrey is attacking Wal-
lace for what he is—a hate
monger feeding on the dark
midnight of the American
mind. ‘

Mr. Nixon, on the other

hand, simply says that Wal-
lace cannot win.

3. Then there is the issue
of law and order. Nixon cri-
ticizes the Supreme Court
and makes proposals _ that
have already been effected
by executive orders or laws.

Humphrey, on the. other
hand, talks about order and
justice. He understands that
there cannot be justice with-
out just laws and there can-
not be meaningful order with-
out programs to eliminate in-
justice in this land.

4. Finally, there is the is-
sue of the peace of the world.
One of Mr. Nixon’s most ir-
responsible acts to date was
his call for postponing Senate
ratification of the treaty that
would prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons to non-nu-
clear countries. He said that
the Senate should postpone
action because of the Czech
crisis and the Soviet inter-
vention there.

Humphrey has made _ it
clear that he is for the vigor-
ous pursuit of arms control
negotiations to slow down the
arms race and to cut free
some of the vast resources
now tied up in defense bud-
gets.

If the issues discussed
above are considered import-
ant, then I suggest that DA-
VIDSONIAN readers go to
the polls on November 5, and
vote for Hubert Humphrey
and Edmund Muskie. Even in
this election year—especially
in this election year—it mat-
ters!

Election — 1968

OCTOBER 25, 1968

‘Law And Order’

who feel they have had no
body. He is a populist candi-
date who seeks to offer to
the electorate what it has
not gotten from the two
major middle.of the - road
parties.

‘Liberty is a balance. And
the white working ‘man is
threatened when that liberty
balance is upset. It is he
who must live in the cities.
He's the man who takes the
loss.

You ask for understand-
ing? Live poor white for a
while. Have your children
go to inferior schools while
the country's
lament the state of the Neg
ro in America and draft blue
collar families’ sons to fight
a foolish war?

Wallace does not appeal
just to the “law and order”
theme as he is so often ac
cused.

Does ‘he talk about it any
more than either of the
other candidates, or do the
news media just make’ a4
bigger show of it?

He has proposed a 6C per-
cent increase in Social Secur-
ity benefits. His platform
plank on education recognizes
the need for continued fed-
eral aid to education. Are
these pigheaded?

His policies as governor
were liberal — funds for
education. mental  institu-
tions and other state services
were increased.

The Wallace contention that
it is time that government
efforts be exerted toward de-
velopment of more home-
based industry in the South
is one that should be given
credit . . . neither of the
other major candidates has
spoken up for such a pro-
gram. All of these are for-
ward-looking proposals —
yet all smothered by the
same hysteria that white
liberals try to tag on the
Wallace supporters.

Some people .khave confus-
ed Wallace's intent with his
rhetoric. Knowing that he
must appeal to a certain part

intellectuals _

of the electorate to win a
victory, Wallace has éengag
ed in all manner of hyper-
bolic, crowd pleasing rhe
toric . . . a style not un.
common in the American
political experience.

But like all good politic.
ians, Wallace knows, unlike
the purists of the Barry Gold-
water genre, that politics de
mands flexibility. He knows
that the President must con
stantly take the~ nation’s
political pulse if he wishes to
exercise -any power at ali.

It _ is
understanding that Wallace
has told aides and reporters
that if elected he will quickly
move to reassure the Negro
population.

Wallace admits that his
plea for “Jaw and order,’ is
one which would become
only a ‘‘moral leadership"
of the White House if he
were elected. Can the, Presi
dent do more than that? Is
oppressive legislation really
a possibility with a Demo-
cratic Republican Congress?

Another disturbing mis-
conception regarding Wall-
ace has arisen among “en.
lightened’’ college students
and professors and other
intellectual groups: the
whole character and ignor-
ance attributed to many of
the Wallace supporters has
been posited on George Wall-
ace, the man and the candi
date. How Would Nixon and
Humphrey fare if they were
assumed to be men of the
same character as some of
their supporters?

none of whom’ °

because of this.

with which he has been
associated for the past four
years. But the difficulties of
admitting his party‘s leader-
ship has been misguided,
and then setting it on a new
course, seem almost insuper-
able.

Charisma

The only real charismatic
personality in the campaign
has been George Wallace.
His success more than any-
thing else reveals the wide-
spread frustration which
undercuts the entire cam-
paign. He has led almost 20
percent of the nation’s lower
and middle class citizens to
believe that they can have
a voice in national affairs,
but the other 80 percent re-
main alienated by his ugly
record of segregation.

The selection of vice-presi-
dential candidates is equally
unexciting. In order, the
Presidential candidates have
chosen a ‘‘fourth-rate hack
politician’’ .(George Ball's
description of Spiro Agnew).
a Maine Senator with a libe-
ral voting record guaranteed
to smash the already totter.
ing Solid South, and a re-
tired Air Force general who
once advised bombing Viet-
nam “back to the Stone
Age.”

Though Edmund Muskie
seems clearly the most quali-
fied man to be vice president.
he is so unfortunate as. to
be on a ticket which would
have been far behind no mat-
ter who was chosen.

Focus

If none of the personalities
of Campaign ‘68 stand out,
at least America's young

‘voters should

be able to
make their choice on who
presented the issues in clear-
est focus and offered the
answers which seemed most
likely to lead to solutions to
the sickness of the society
within or the weakness of its
relations abroad.

Everyone has talked about
peace, law and order and
national unity, but no one has
convinced the American
people that he, and he alone,
can achieve these three
goals.

These have been the three
major issues of the cam-
paign. Unfortunately they
have been posed in an im-
possible context.

They have been approach.
ed in terms of what can be
done in the next four years.

One fact, however, has re-
mained hidden, and no can-
didate has had the courage
to reveal it — even if he
realized it. That fact is that

‘there simply are no four-year

answers.

The issues are those which
must be faced for another
generation, not just for an-
other administration. The do-
mestic issue of law and
order is just the surface
manifestation of a much
deeper .and more complex
problem.

The real issue is how our
society can be restructured
without disintegrating in the
process. There has been no
comprehensive plan for ac-
complishing such a goal —
only suggestions and ideas
randomly inserted here and
there.

‘Nixon’s The

By JON W. FULLER

The Presidency is ‘“‘the
vital place of action” ‘in the
American political system.
These words of Woodrow
Wilson are even more true
today than they were in his
own time, and they direct
our attention to the central
issue of this campaign year:
which of the candidates will
be most likely to give us the
energetic and _ effective
leadership we must have?

The answer for 1968 seems
clear — Nixon's the one!

The first order of: business
for the new Admistration
must be Vietnam. Even
those who began that un-
happy adventure now agree
that we can not go on paying
its high cost. There are too
many other important prob
lems which demand our at
tention and our resources.

Humphrey sincerely wants
to end the war, despite his
‘enthusiastic support of it in
{he past. But his close identi.
fication with its érrors makes
it virtually impossible for
him to accept less than a
clear victory. No settlement
which will be possible any
time in the near future can
be. made to look like a vic-
tory.

Nixon has a clear advant.
age: he can blame the un
attractive aspects of a set.
tlement on the previous ad
ministrition. Humphrey
would have no one to blame
but himself.

Any settlement in Vietnam
likely to be available soon
would probably destroy Hum-
phrey politically. Yet a fail-
ure to get some relief: from
this burden would be equally
disastrous. Nixon would be
free to get us out of Viet-
nam: Humphrey would not.

Once Vietnam is off our
backs. we face a preplexing
array of problems here at
home — most of them con-
cerning the crisis in our
cities. Humphrey offers com-
passion. but no new. ideas
to deal with these needs.

Nixon's statements reflect
the most recent insights —
citing men like John Gardner
and Daniel Moynihan. He
recognizes that more money
from Washington, although
it will be necessary, will not
solve the problem.

The involvement of talents
outside of government, and
campaigns directed at chang-
ing attitudes, are part of

Nixon's program.

Nixon can draw on the. en-
thusiasm, energy and ability
of a long list of Republicans,
which includes almost all of
the men who have attracted
favorable notice in Congress
and in state and loca! govern
ment in recent years.

Humphrey would have to
form his administration from
the very group of men who
now sit in Washington, frus-
trated and exhaused by their
labors and failures in the
Johnson years.

The very suceess of Nix
on’s campaign in contrast to
Humphrey's amazingly poor
showing argues for Nixon's
probable superiority in the
Presidency itself.

No job is comparable to
that of the President, but
that of a candidate comes
closest, and success in the
campaign is a good omen for
a successful administration.

The country needs a
change. The failures of. the
Johnson-Humphrey —admin-
istration have been painfully
obvious to all of us. To
believe that Humphrey, with
the assistance of the same

The issue of peace is not
simply the issue of what ‘to
do about Vietnam. Granted
that the new administration's
first task will be to extricate
itself from the Vietnam
quagmire as soon as pos-
sible, but the overriding
issue, the one which has been
ignored, should be how to
avoid other Vietnams.

The problem is one of
translating national interests
into a system of priorities
for foreign policy decision.
making rather than being
forced, time and again, to
crisis decisions in a policy
vacuum. With this overrid-
ing issue no. candidate has
as yet come to grips.

The Key

The key to solving the two
problems inherent within the
issues of peace and law and
order is finding a solution
to the third issue — national
unity.

The chief task of a new
administration will be to
gain enough of the people's
trust and confidence so that
it can begin the task of
organizing a new foreign and
domestic policy while at the
same time facing the pre-
dicaments certain to arise be-
cause of the old policies.

For the young voters. the
choice is especially signifi-
cant for they must choose
the leader who will broach
the task which only they can
bring to a successful con-
clusion. It is indeed a hard
choice: one can only hope
that it will never again be so
difficult.

familiar faces from the cabi-
net and staff, could provide

energy we need requires a
credulity inappropriate to the
serious business of. electing

ability of Rockefeller, Rom-
