Harriers Tie Pembroke,
Nix Campell, St. Andrews

Davidson's harriers tied a
tough Pembroke team yester-
day und scored wins over two
others in a meet. held at St.
Andrews College in Laurin-
burg.

The ‘Cat cross-countrymen
matched Pembroke's 32
points, while benting out
runners from St, Andrews
and Campbell College.

Carl Newhbay of Pembroke
paced the runners, finishing
well ahead of Davidson's
John Puckett. who finished
first far the ‘Cats.

“Newhhbay is a real Fine
runner,’ Puckett said. “Tran
against him in high school.
He had a cross-country schol-
arship to Miami but trans-

ferred after they discontinu-
ed cross-country."

Jim McLaughlin finished
‘sixth in the race and second
for Davidson.

Puckett said the “Cats were
hampered by their unfamil-
jJarity with the course. “We
had to finish the last 40 yards
on 4 grass-tex track,” he
said. “When I got on the
track I was in about fourth
place. That's when I started
getting scared.”

Although the ‘Cats failed to
grab many of the top six or
seven positinos, they did seal
up about four or five spots in
a row behind the number
seven riumner.
