"Publish Or Perish"? Faculty Says Teaching Comes First

By Lisa Gerrard

The National Review College
Guide, published earlier this year,
portrays Davidsonas falling slowly
into the evil clutches of the “‘pub-
lish or perish” creature lurking
about fine liberal arts institutions.

“As (Davidson) moves into the
national spotlight,” states the Re-
view, “some college administra-
tors and faculty members havebeen
pushing for a greater emphasis on
published ‘research’ as a qualifi-
cation for hiring and promoting
professors....Some senior profes-
sors, who are among the school’s
most distinguished, go so far as to
say they doubt they would be
awarded tenure at Davidson today
because of the shift toward re-
search,”

Truth or propaganda? The
Davidsonian asked ine faculty
members from eight departments.
The overwhelming majority dis-

agree with the Review’s statements. —

From department chairs to the
recently tenured to a first-year
assistant professor, they maintain
that Davidson’s first priority is
teaching, and see no dichotomy
between goals of excellence in the
classroom and aspirations of ac-
complishment in their fields.
“It’s not true,” said Dr. John

Williamson of the biology depart-

ment. “‘T think that anything you
see in The National Review you
should forget.”

“There’s a myth present in the
land, and that’s that one has to
make a choice between being a
teacher and being a researcher,”
said Dr. Thomas Kazee of the po-
litical science department. “I don’t
see those two as incompatible. At
Davidson, we can do both.”

Students seem to agree. Sen-

The Davidsonian has ap-
pointed the new editorial staff for
the 1991-2 year. Next year’s Edi-

ompson, and the Executive Edi-

Thompson isa junior English
major from Hickory, North Caro-
lina. He has been a columnist for
the opinions section and is cur-
rently the news editor.

When asked to comment on
hisnew position and hopes for the
future, Thompson stated “I’m too

was looking forward to running
the Davidsonian next year.
Executive Editor Leigh
McKeever also expressed enthu-
siam, saying, “I am really excited
about the future of The
Davidsonian. Lintend to put forth
‘my besteffort.” Walter Price,Co-
Executive Editor, comments,
“I’m very excited about the op-
portunity to be an Editor. I hope
we can build on what Jay

Strickland say they like the fact
that professors have ongoing re-
search projects because it gives
them the chance to participate and
learn more than ‘they would in a
purely text-oriented classroom. _

But warning voices continue
to echo in the halls of Chambers
and other academic buildings. Most
of those interviewed were depart-
ment chairs. Dissenting faculty
members say those who hold these
appointed positions reflect the

administration’s views and not the

real picture. They warn of “win-
dow dressing” that hypes excellent
teaching but expects published
work at too early a point in an
academic’s career.

Dr. Gill Holland of the English
department read The Review’s
statement, his immediate response

was, “That’s absolutely right.” He .

feels that the current administra-
tion’s emphasis on research pushes
the faculty to a dangerous “univer-
sity mentality” thatcould result not
only in less concern for students,
but also in “unripe scholarship.”
“T don’t like the trend,” Hol-
land said. “I’ve always thought that
scholarship was important. But

it’s out of balance. I find myself
defending the old way, while in
previous years I took the other side.
It’s as if there is something grade
‘B’ about teaching and taking regu-
lar sabbaticals to do slow research
-- and that’s dangerous. Extra
leaves ‘to do one’s work’ bring in
more and more temporary instruc-
tors, and that’s bad for the stu-
dents.”

Several professors noted evalu-
ation procedures detailed in the
faculty handbook, which reads,
“The criteria for faculty evaluation
at Davidson are: (1) excellence in
teaching, (2) demonstration of
superior professional attainments
in research, scholarship, and cur-
riculum design, and (3) exemplifi-
cation of the intellectual and moral
values for which’ the College
stands.”

While an emphasis on “pro-
fessional attainments” flows
throughout the handbook, it main-
tains that “while no_ precise
weights...can be attached to each
of these areas, excellence in teach-
ing is a necessary condition for
tenure.”

The handbook explains that
“good teaching maitercoptiveal

study to keep up with develop-
ments in one’s field and to achieve
that understanding of related fields
so important to the idea of liberal
education.” In regard to publica-
tion, it states that “quality will be

‘deemed more significant than

quantity.”

One professor said that when
he was awarded tenure just last
spring, his only published work
was one article and some critical
reviews. He had submitted a book
manuscript for publication but did
notknow if it would be accepted or
not. “I don’t feel like I was penal-
ized because I didn’t have a lot of
things published,” he said.

Dr. Anthony Abbott of the
English department agrees with
Dean of Faculty Robert Williams
that the College still considers
teaching the most important factor
in the decision to grant tenure.

Candidates may be considered
after six years of teaching, at least
three of which must have been at
Davidson. At that time, evaluation
begins in the department, where all
tenured members formulate a rec-
ommendation and forward it to the

Visual Arts Building Changes

Groundbreaking on the new
Visual Arts Building is likely to
take place within the next twelve
months.

James Gibert, Assistant Direc-
tor of Development, said that he is

hesitant to target a specific date —

because fundraising efforts al-
ways have a certain degree of un-
certainty.

The blueprints for the new arts
facility have changed since the
plans were unveiled last spring.

~ Originally, the facility was to
include four separate buildings,
now there will be just one building.
Gibert said the decision to build

one instead of-four was made -

mainly to cut costs.
“The new plan should save
about $600,000,” he said.

Gibert also said that the new
plans will not significantly change
the amount of usable floor space.
Instead of a courtyard separating
the four buildings in the old design,

the new plan calls for a two-story.

glass-roofed atrium.

Surrounding the atrium will be
instructional studios, lecture halls,
individual student studios, and the
William H. Van Every Gallery:

The facility will be located in
the visitors parking lot on the cor-
ner of Main and Griffith Street.

Planning for the Visual Arts
Center began in the early eighties
andis intended toreduce the crowd-
ing of the Music, Theatre, and
Visual Arts departments currently
based in the Cunningham Fine Arts
Building.
