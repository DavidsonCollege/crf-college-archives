DR. McILWAINE IS
SUNDAY “Y” SPEAKER

Davidson students were glad to
welcome again Rev. W. B. MclIl-
waine, pastor of the Westminster
Presbyterian Church of Charlotte,
who addressed the “Y” at the ves-
per service Sunday. Doctor Mcll-
waine visited the campus last fall
and spoke before the same gather-
ing on the subject of “Jesus Before
Pilate,” in which he gave a great
impression of Christ as He stood
before the king of earthly power.

Ted Jones led the singing for
the occasion, and Purdy was at his
accustomed place at the piano.
White and Finn were faithful to
their places in furnishing the in-
strumental music.

Bascomb Sorrells had charge of
the services, reading the Scripture
lesson, and later introducing the
speaker of the evening. During
the opening exercises Harry Price
and Eugene Regen led the house in
prayer.

Doctor McIlwaine, in his opening
remarks, spoke of the pleasure of
such an occasion, and spoke highly
of the manner in which Arnett
Gamble filled Doctor McIlwaine’s
pulpit on a former occasion.

Takin for his ‘subject “Jesus
Christ,” the speaker said, in part:
“When a man tells you he is going
to preach a sermon on the subject
of Jesus Christ, you immediately
expect a-dry sermon. When men
speak of Jesus Christ they preach
dry sermons.

“But why so? Surely it is not
the subject, for they are speaking
of Jesus, the one perfect Man;
Jesus, the one perfect Teacher;
Jesus, the one perfect Example for
man to follow; Jesus the Godly
Man; Jesus, the Savior of the
World. Surely there is nothing
wrong with the subject.

“Dry talking is the result of dry
thinking. We think of Christ as a
Christ of nineteen centuries ago, as
one who is not present today. The
centuries have added a haze, and
make it appear that Christ is in. the
distance.

“We sometimes think of' Christ
as a dead Christ. We see His life

and His lifetime teachings. We
see Him on the cross and we think
of Him as dead. We do not think
of the Resurrected Christ. “Again,

gone away to Himself. Such er-
roneous thoughts of Him keen

for Him.
“There are too many dogmas,
and too little real,motive power in

mas. :

“Paul preached Christ; and three
thousand were saved to Him in one
day. He preached Christ and Him
crucified, and he turned the world
upside down. This was because
Paul preached the Living Christ,
and because Christ was with Him.
To Paul, Christ ‘was the present
Christ, the Living Christ. “Paul
witnessed for Christ as the Resur-
rected Christ. Paul practiced the
Living Christ.

“Get the conviction of truth in
your life. Remove all doubts from!
your heart. Practice the living
Christ. Look to the risen Christ.
As you see with the eyes of the soul,
He will become real to you.

“Walk with circumspection be-,
fore Christ. As you would if your
mother were present, so walk in
His presence. See Christ as the
Present Christ, and all doubt will
disappear. Know Christ as He is
today.” *

Here the speaker told of the late
Dr. Theron H. Rice, of Union
Theological Seminary, who, when
asked that, if scientific discoveries
should be made that cast doubt on
the foundation of the Christian re-
ligion, what effect they would have
upon him ,he replied, “They would |
not affect me in the least, for I

sented in this allegorical picture of a
typical college campus of today. Af-
ter this pageant a very delightful re-)
ception was given to the delegates in|
the “Y” building.

A morning watch was held Sunday
at 9:30 and afterwards the students
attended the regular services of the
vhurches in Raleigh.

That afternoon Mrs. J. L. Ander-,

of the founders of the N. C. V. U.
in 1912, told of last year’s meeting
of the World Christian Students

Movement is a part) in China. In

'Lionel and Plunkett who are ignorant
'of their idenity.

The third act finds Lady Harriet
and Nancy, as Martha and Julia, in
the house of Plunkett. The result is
that Lionel falls in love with Martha
and Plunkett with Julia. They are
secretly in love with the two farmers
of her father to go to the fair at
but do not show it. In this act, Mar-
tha sang a beautiful solo which

brought the house down and Lionel
to his knees. The act closes by Mar-
tha and Julia escaping, when they find
out their predicament, with the aid of
Martha’s father.

’ The fourth act was the climax of
the play. While in the forest alone
Lionel sings over the song which
Martha sang to him. Martha-appears
but conceals her ldve from him. He
finds out her rank and gives up all
hope of winning her love. They meet
again this time in a company of hun-
ters and huntresses. She tells ,him
she cares for him and Julia does not
refuse Plunkett’s advances.

After, the curtain fell the whole

cheers of an enthusiastic audience.
The operetta was splendid and those
responsible for it are to be congratu-
lated on the wonderful way they
managed it. The proceeds of the
show go towards the Davidson annual.
