Ligo restores Milton Cowan log cabin

A large, rough-hewn oak cabin sits on
its new cinderblock foundation three
miles from the college down Grey Road.
It is a patriarch among houses in the
area, being one of the finest and best
preserved examples of hand made log
cabins in the state,

The cabin is called The Milton Cowan
house by the people around Beaver
Creek. Dam where the cabin was built
and remained until 1974. But Milton
Cowan was the house’s second owner.
The builder and first owner of the house
was William Cowan, a gunsmith who
acquired the 183 acres of land on which
the house originally stood in 1800.

Cowan's wife

The house was probably built in 1803
or 1804 for Cowan’s wife. The couple was
its first inhabitants, and lived there until
Cowan’s death in 1845.

The house now belongs to Professor of
Art Larry L. Ligo, who is restoring it
expecting to live there when the work is
completed.

Ligo’s interest in restoring a cabin of
this type began in 1973 when Ligo and’
Tom Hatley, (then a senior) were
looking at cabins in the area. They
thought that the college might like to
sponsor a program to restore a log
cabin. The college was not able to do
this, although several people in the area
offered to give the college such a cabin.

Ligo decided to buy a cabin himself
and attempt to restore it as much as he
could with only the help of Davidson
students. Students who helped were
those who volunteered or those involved
in a special extended studies making the
house their project.

Dairy farm

Ligo found his cabin ona dairy farm in
Mt. Ulla, North Carolina, belonging to
Mr. T.S. and J.L. Hoffner. The Hoffners
were using the cabin as a storage shed.

The two story house has three rooms
down stairs and one large room above.
The cabin is constructed from red oak
logs that are a foot thick. These logs, the
originals with the structure, are a foot
thick. These original logs with the cabin
are still free from decay, owing to the
fact that the cabin was set on pilings
about 10 inches off of the round, away
from termites and moisture.

“The cabin, when we found it, was
covered with panelling. The inside was
covered with sheetrock, and the cabin
had a false ceiling about a foot lower
than the real ceiling,” said junior Dan
Thorpe, a student who helped with the
restoration and wrote a history of ‘the

‘‘We .had to do our work in
layers, stripping off the
panelling and sheetrock. The
only way we could estimate the
age of the structure was to look
at the nails and saw-tooth
marks in the wood.

‘‘We found three distinct
layers. One was from the 1940’s,
the second from 1840 when we
think improvements were made
on the original cabin, and the
third dating back to 1804 when
the cabin was actually built,”
said Thorpe. :

After the job of cleaning the
cabin was finished, the group of
students with Ligo could decide
what was missing from the
house. It appeared to be
missing a porch that it once had
and, according to Thorpe, there
were some un-identified holes
over the windows in the house.

‘‘Some historians of ar-
chitecture in Winston Salem
were able to identify the holes
as remnants of a type of siding
called pent eves,”’ said Thorpe.

“These were the last example
of this form of architecture
found in North Carolina. They
disappeared about 1770,
mysteriously reappearing on
this cabin in 1803. No one knows
why.

‘Pent eves or pent roofs are
small shed roofs attached to the
upper walls of a log building to
keep rain from striking the
otherwise unprotected walls
an washing away the
daubing,”’ continued Thorpe.

They were generally about
two feet long, angled away from
the’ wall approximately 45
degrees and were found on
walls that.did not: havea: full

porch to protect them,’’ said
Thorpe.

The pent roofs on the Cowan
house extended along the entire
east wall, which was the front of
the house. They began about on
a level with the second floor and
sloped down from there.

“The pent roofs remained on
the. house until a tenant took
them down in 1935. We talked to
that man and he confirmed that
the authorities in Winston
Salem were correct in thinking
that the holes in the wall meant
pent roofs. The man said that he
had to take the roofs off because
they were insect ridden,’’ Thor-
pe added.

Removed roof

The actual process of dis-
assembling the cabin so that it
could be moved was an exercise.
in patience and care. The roof
was removed including the raf-
ters--all in one piece, and the
chimney was taken down. This
was the most difficult portion of
the work of moving the house

‘When we took the chimney
down, we started at the top and
took it down brick by brick, first
with paint because that was
more permanent and easier to
see and then with magic
marker on tape which we stuck
to each brick. We took pictures
at each course of stacked brick.
When we got it alldown.-we put it
in the living room. Then a
professional had to move it: to
Davidson.”

Beconstruction

Once in Davidson, the recon-
struction began. A professional
mason was hired to rebuild the
chimney according to
specifications and the
photographs from the Beaver
Creek Dam site.

“We had to rebuild the roof in
a different style, with more in-
sulation. Ligo intends to live in
the house, but he wants to have
the modern conveniences. We
got the rafters for the roof
especially cut so that they
would bear the same sort of saw
marks as the originals,’’ said
Thorpe.

“We had quite a job deciding
how to rebuild in a way that
would hide the modern con-
veniences. We cheated in some
places, the daubing between the
logs, for instance is colored
cement,”’ Thorpe smiled.

‘‘We found one of the original
windows upstairs in the house
and were able to get a mill to
copy the frame for us. Winston
Salem blew us some window
glass authentic to 1840,” said
Thorpe.

The cabin now sits on its ‘‘per-
manent site’’, where Ligo
plans to fully reconstruct it and
move in when it is finished.

Blueprints

Blueprints. have been drawn
up for the additions that Ligo
wishes to make, including an
entirely new structure. to
surround the cabin on three
sides.

“TI think Ligo wants to com-
bine the old and the new in his
home. This will be where the
talent and imagination of the
project will come into play,”
said senior John M. Bevan Jr.
who currently lives’ in the
house.

Bevan is living in rather spar-
tan conditions acting as a
caretaker for the house. He has
a kitchen with water but must
use an out house. There is no
central heating so Bevan must
