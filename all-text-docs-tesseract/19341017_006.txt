THE DAVIDSONIAN,

OCTOBER 17, 1934

NINETY MEN Ant
HIRED BY FERA

Satisfactory Scholarship Is Re-
quired Of Men Receiving
Federal Aid

The Federal Emergency Relief Ad-
ministration is now employing about
ninety men at Davidson.

Professor Fleagle is in charge of the
FERA at Davidson College. At first he
was allowed to employ only seventy-three
men but now he can work more, just so
he keeps under the budget assigned to
this college.

There has been a little misunderstand-
ing as to the maximum amount that can
be earned. No student can earn as much
as twenty-one dollars a month. The
Davidson student's allotment is based on
an average of fifteen dollars per student.

Satisfactory scholarship is one of the
requirements of continuing on the FERA
payroll. When a_ student's scholastic
grade becomes unsatisfactory, he may
expect to be summoned before the com-
mittee in charge of the FERA work,
and may be dropped from the payroll
until the student improves his standing.

The most important project being
handled now is the clearing of the woods
surrounding the golf links. A crew of
twelve men are at work under Professor
Blythe and Captain Cochrane.

them to the tune of more than several
touchdowns in each game.

The first game with the “Flying
Squadron” of V. M. I., ended in a rout
for the Virginia téam, with the power-
ful, well-polished Duke team scoring al-
most at will.

The following Saturday, the Clemson
Tigers were-on-the-receiving- end of the
Blue Devils walloping attack, and al-
though the jungle beasts fought coura-
geously, they were humbled 20-6,

The game with the rambling wrecks
from Tech, proved to be quite en un-
expected smash-up with the team from
Atlanta being rolled under 20 to 0 before
a crowd of 28,000 people.

So far Davidson has only one victory
to her credit, the Elon game, which was
in itself a track meet for the far superior
‘Cat team.

The two defeats handed them by State
and Army, were games played away from
home and against the country’s best
teams. However, with the Duke con-
test to be played here, the 'Cats are much
more confident and believe that they can
present a scrappy fight, if not a winning
team, when the whistle is blown at 2:30
Saturday afternoon:

Davidson’s .probable starting lineup
will average 182 pounds as against Duke’s
185 pounds per man.
backs will average around 163 pounds
per man Duke’s approximate 170
pounds.

Of the twelve games that Have been
played since 1922,
ind Davidson four. One of these games
ended in a 0 to 0 tie in 1931, when Wade
first took over the Blue Devils. The
Duke teams have scored~}69 points to
94 for the Presbyterian,

Dr. T..W. Lingle recently made a
very interesting trip to the Northeastern
section of the State. This trip took him
to Wake Forest where, on Sunday, Sep-

Into

Ten Per Cent Increase
Found In Registration

An increase of ten per cent over last
year’s college enrollment was noted in
a review of the reports sent in by col-
leges and universities to the National
Student Federation and the most marked
increase was in the enrollment of West-
ern colleges. Authorities attributed this
lead to the rise in the price of farm com-
modities, In other parts of the country
good business conditions pointed toward
an increase in enrollment.

The Federal Emergency Relief, which
makes available funds for part-time re-
lief, has aided about fifty thousand new
students to enter college. This figure
represents about six per cent of the total
number of college students. The fact
that tuition has become a good deal lower
in many colleges has lead to a marked
increase in registration.

Almost every college reported an in-
crease in the number of its freshman
class. Columbia, Vassar, Wellesley, and
many-similar“institutions reported a great
increase in the number of first year stu-
dents. Harvard, Brown, Colgate, and
universities like them, have reported a
thirty-five per cent increase in applicants
for enrollment.

In no institution in the Middle ‘West
is there a report in decrease in their en-
rollment. The figures for the far West
indicate a swing toward an even higher
level than the national average.

Exercise Required For
Men Not Taking ROTC

Captain Pritchett announced in chapel
last Thursday morning that all men who
are not taking R. O. T. C. are required
to take three hours of exercise per week.

This year all freshmen who are not
taking R. O. T. C. are required to take
a gymnasium workout under supervision
three times a week on Monday, Wednes-
day, and Friday afternoons at 3:30
o'clock. There is also one lecture
health and hygiene one night each week
for such students. Credit for this course
is given for attendance and examinations.
The seme thing is true for sophomores
not taking the military training course.

Therefore, all freshmen and sopho-
mores who are not taking R. O. T. C.,
who aré not on the varsity or freshman

New Drainage System

Installed At Davidson

Two new culverts will be installed to
carry off the surplus water, which sur-
rounds the Presbyterian Church of
Davidson during rainy weather. This has
been a source of great concern to David-
son students attending Church with white
shoes.

Other culverts were installed during
the summer in various places on the
campus to accommodate the water and
prevent the csmpus from being soggy.

The tar sprayer and roller were loaded
on a truck Wednesday, October 10, ter-
minating construction work on the hard
surfaced drives. They have been here
for the past several weeks for the pur-
pose of improving the drives.
