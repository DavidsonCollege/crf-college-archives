A Look Forward

Mid-semesters offers a natural and of-
ten rewarding time for evaluation. It is
appropriate to survey the past semester,
total ap the won and lost columns, and
see how the game was played. It is further
a time to project our’ future out of past
experience and present conditions. The
following are only a few random projec-
tions of the many, both on individual and
college level, which may bring profitable
results.

Friday, Jan. 13, 1956

Scholarships . . . To graduating seniors
the bountiful extent of scholarship offers
available now present opportunities for
study and experience in all fields repre-
sented here at Davidson. Full advantage
of these offers should be made while there
is still time. Underclassmen should also
investigate scholarship requirements and
suggestions for their future reference.
Those seniors who plan to step into the
economic world this June would do well
to consider carefully the Placement Ser-
vice now in operation in the College
Union. Pastoral Counselor . . . There has
long been a need on this campus for a
pastoral counselor: one who would inter-
pret, understand, and help fill the needs
of the individual student in his relation-
ship to his God and fellow men. There is
further a need‘ for interested, organiza-
tional. and co-ordinating activity on be-
half of the some 340 non-Presbyterian stu-
dents here. It is encouraging to note that
a committee is considering this problem.
A student and faculty committee from
the Y Board is studying the position and
duties of the Y General Secretary in the
light of these needs. The present Y Secre-
tary has made long strides in this direc-
tion, but his position is limited by defini-
tion and construction. Student response
and comment on this matter are requested
by the committee. Organizational Evalua-
tion... This is a time when each element
of student representation and organization
should be evaluated in the light of pur-
poses, accomplishments, and campaign
speeches. Along this line, Student Govern-
ment and President Anderson are to be
commended for their work and accom-
plishments of the first semester. Extra-
Curriculars ... should be studied for the
nature, value, and time consumption of
the entire program as well as the com-
ponent parts. Individual evaluation of time
spent away from the basics may also be
helpful as well as revealing. Some have
too many activities; some lack enough—
in the struggle to develop the whole man.
The College Program and Plant... Al-
though this is “a safe place to—" the col-
lege and its program should always be
evaluated in the light of progress, present
needs and inadequacies. How about the
laundrv, College Union, Vesper series, etc.?
Is the physical training program meeting
the needs of all the students, and is the
present PT test adequate? How about the
Curriculum? The faculty is urged to eval-
uate the college educational system to fill
deficiencies, strengthen weak points, and
develop in positive directions. How about
such courses as general physics, introduc-
tory law, more seminar-type instruction,
and expanded philosophy and _ political
science departments? What will David-
son’s answer be to the tremendously in-
creasing number of applicants for admis-
sion to college? Already 450 high school
seniors have applied for entrance into
Davidson in next year’s freshmen class.
What will be the student answer to Greek
Week? A total revamping of Greek Week
is demanded from the Hill. Its success will
depend on student interest, voice, and
creative suggestions.

Along with the exterior view should
come an inner evaluation. It may be re-
warding to project “the old man” 10 or
20 years hence. One aspect of “the old
man” is reflected everyday in his chapel
maturity. Whether you favor “wars” on
management and “splendid strikes;” or
whether you like industrial diplomacy and

vacations at Myrtle Beach it is a quality of
the mature man to allow the speaker a
courteous reception. Those students who
reveal their emotions and their age for
public perusal speak all too adequately for
themselves.

So hefore the rumble dies out on Belk’s
Boardwalk for this semester, let us stop
to evaluate the present position before we
reach into the future. R.H.M.

Homogeneity or No?

It will come as a surprise to no one
that Davidson is almost strictly a South-
eastern college. The question of how more
students from other sections can be at-
tracted has been considered recently in
some circles, and some proposals for ac-
complishing this have been made.

A breakdown of the enrollment in
1953-54. which may be taken as typical,
clearly shows the sectional composition of
the student body. Of 834 students, 782
were from the Southeastern states (those
east of the Mississippi and south of the
Ohio and the Mason-Dixon line). Eight
were from those states with Southern
characteristics. eight more were from the
border states. leaving only nineteen from
other states. There were seven students,
some the sons of missionariés, who made
their homes in foreign countries. Well over
half the students came from North Caro-
lina.

This pattern is not one forced on the
enrollment by the college. The Admis-
sions Committee has neither geographical
nor religious quotas, each application be-
ing considered solely on the grounds of
scholarship and character. The College
Board scores are the major, but not the
sole, criterion for admission. Those appli-
cants who score above a minimum score
and stand in the upper half of their
classes are admitted. provided that they
are not disqualified on the basis of charac-
ter. Those making a lower score may be
admitted upon further examination of
their records.

Several reasons can be given for this
pattern. Perhaps the major cause is the
general ignorance about Davidson outside
the Southeast. This is shown by remarks
which circulated around the Harvard cam-
pus after a Davidson football game: “Yes-
terday we beat Davidson — whoever that
might be.” Davidson is known and re-
spected in the Southeast, especially among
Presbyterians, but most Easterners are
as blissfully ignorant of us as we are of
comparable institutions in their states.

Much could be done through active
alumni club promotion, which is not be-
ing done at the present time, although
there are large groups of alumni in other
sections. Such clubs should perform the
valuable task of presenting Davidson to
outstanding students in their areas and
encouraging them to attend.

A further source of information to
prospective students is the advertising of
the George F. Baker and other scholar-
ships. Unfortunately, most of this pub-
licity is distributed in the areas from
which most of our students already come.
An expansion of the campaign to include
at least the highest ranking preparatory
schools in all parts of the Union would do
much to attract students who would not
otherwise enroll.

Davidson's sectional pattern is rein-
forced by the lack of large funds for
scholarships. Many Eastern colleges grant
scholarships solely on the basis of ability,
while Davidson must give consideration to
the need of the applicants. No tabulation
has been made of those who apply and
then «lo not enter, but it is known that
many of the approximately 150 applicants
for scholarships do not enter when they
do not reccive grants. Even some of those
who have won Baker scholarships have
enrolled elsewhere when they have been
offered larger scholarships at other insti-
tutions. Until enough scholarships are
available to attract outstanding students,
Davidson will continue to be at a disad-
vantage and will continue to lose good
candidates to other colleges.—M.A.C.

Student Prexy Anderson Gives
Report on Council’s Activities

I would tike to pause here at
the end of the first semester and
outline just what your Student
Government has attempted to do
during these past months. In the

first place, an attempt has been.

made this year to make the stu-
dent body aware of what Student
Government is doing.

For the first time regularly
scheduled Council meetings have.
been held and have been covered
by Davidsonian reporters. All stu-

TOM WARLICK

dents have been invited to attend
these meetings. In addition the Stu.
dent Government office on the sec-
ond floor of the College Union is
open every weekday from 1:40-3:00
P. M.
Council Policy

The Student Council has tried to
take a serious interest in those
things which are of concern to the
student body and has tried to avoid
adopting projects, committees, or
investigations merely for the sake

Local Club Seeks to Stimulate
Interest in Foreign Affairs

(This is another in a series of articles on the various members
of the Honorary Fraternity Council, reviewing the organizations’

purposes and functions. Ed.)

In 1914, on the eve of World War
I, the first four Internationa! Rela-
tions Clubs were formed on the
campuses of Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, and Columbia Universities.
From this smal! but impressive be-
ginning the movement quickly
spread until there are at present
over 600 IRCs in the United States
and a large number in other lands.

In 1948 the present national or-
ganization, the Association of In-
ternational Relations Clubs, was
formed. The Davidson club is also
@ member of the International Re-
lations Clubs of North Carolina.
The purposes of the Davidson club
as well as the AIRC are to promote
interest in and to inform its mem-
bers and others on issues of inter-
national relations and to contribute
to the advancement of world peace
based on justice and freedom.

In 1924 the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace undertook
the responsibility of further de-
veloping and
leading the club
movement. This
group, an inde-
pendent, non-po-
litical organiza-
tion, was found-
ed in 1910 by
Andrew Car-
negie and has
been providing
valuable  assis-
tance to IRCs
since becoming associated with
them. It seeks to encourage more
and better international relations
studies in American colleges and
universities.

Local Organization

The DavidGon club was organized
in 1918. For several years it was
known as the International Policy
Club. Since 1921, however, it has
been known as the International
Relations Club. Meetings are held
the first Wednesday evening in
each month at 9:15 P. M. and on
other special occasions. Member-
ship is open to any student in at-
tendance at Davidson College. The
only requirement is that the stu-
dent have a sincere and continuing
interest in problems relating to in-
ternational relations. Anyone in-

Warlick

terested in membership should con-
tact the president of the organi-
zation.

This year’s officers are Tom
Wartick, President; Tom Tennant,
Vice-President; and Phil Kukura,
Secretary-Treasurer. Our very able
faculty advisor is Dr. Paul A. Mar-
rotte. Dr. Harold P. Ford, profes-
sor of political science while on
leave from the State Department,
has also consented to work with
the club during the year.

Our policy is that the students
themselves prepare and present the
programs for all of our regular
meetings. Our program chairman,
Tom Tennant, is especially well.
qualified for. this work. On special
occasions we sponsor programs
featuring prominent outside speak.
ers as well as faculty members. In
this connection we hope to bring
to the campus during the second
semester two speakers who are well
acquainted with various fields of
international relations. These meet-
ings will be open to the general
public.

Intercollegiate Meetings

We also participate in joint meet-
ings with other IRCs in North and
South Carolina. Last year one of
the most successful activities of the
club was a joint meeting held at
Winthrop College in Rock Hill, S.
C. Arrangements are nearing com-
pletion for a joint meeting to be
held with the Winthrop group here
in the spring.

Wilson Centennial .
The Davidson club has a unique
opportunity for service this year.
The centennial of Woodrow Wilson
will be celebrated in 1956 with the
theme “Freedom for man—a world
safe for mankind.” The AIRC has
also adopted this theme for the
year and IRCs everywhere will be
participating in the celebration. As
Davidson, where Woodrow Wilson
attended from 1873-4, has been
designated by the Woodrow Wilson
Foundation as one of three institu-
tions around which the celebration
will center, the Davidson IRC hopes
that it will be able to contribute
something of real value to the cen-
tennial .

of activity. However, it is the ob-
ject of the Student Government not
only to pursue courses of action
which are concerned with student
desires, but also to do all possible

ato aid the efficiency and welfare of

the College.

To be more specific let me list
the main accomplishments of Stu-
dent Government during this se-
mester.

As a result of a petition by the
Student Council the ROTC depart-
ment reversed its decision of last
year and now grants a probation-
ary cut in accordance with the
practice of the rest of the college
departments.

One of the most time consuming
projects of the first semester has
been an extended and extensive ef-
fort to get the telephone exchange
of Davidson included on the Char-
lotte exchange. Of necessity any
such action had to emanste from
the townspeople and consequently
this project has not been widely
advertised.

As it now stands both the David-
son and the Cornelius Lions’ Clubs
have endorsed the project and a
poll of the 1077 phone owners of
this area will be taken by these
groups within the next couple of
weeks. If 70 percent of the phone
holders sign the petitinn the Da-
vidson area will be in a strong po-
sition to bargain with Southern Bell
for the extended service.

Parking Investigated

The parking situation, which
aroused much student discussion,
was thoroughly investigated and

- oe was found to be
the best possible.
under existing
circumstances.
However, as a
result of this in-
vestigation Mr.
Martin did open
the restricted
parking areas to
student automo-
biles from noon
Saturday until
midnight Sunday.

Since the beginning of the year
Student Council members have
been active on the Chapel Commit-
tee concerned with chapel pro-
grams. I feel that all will agree that
chapel programs have greatly im-
proved this year and we hope for
still more improvement during the
next semester. .

The Social Committee of the
faculty, as a result of a petition by
the Student Council, has agreed to
allow any fraternity an extra off-
campus social function if special
circumstances seem to justify such
an additional event.

Anderson

The Student Government has al-
so been participating actively in
the National Student Association.
In conjunction with this organize
tion we are currently engaged in
attempting to secure an exchange
student from the Soviet Union for
the coming school yeer. The as-
sociation is stil! in the process of
clearing such an exchange through

THE OPEN FORUM—————

Question: There has been a good
deal of talk about withdrawals dur-
ing the current year. Have the
number end the nature of the cases
been really unusual?

Answer: There have been 15
withdrawals during the first se-
mester: 14 voluntary and 1 invol-
untary. I do not have exact figures
for preceding years. However, it
is my impression, and this checks
with that of other administrative
offices, that the number is about
average. Nor do I believe that the
nature of the withdrawals has been
really unusual. Of the 14 voluntary
withdrawals, 3 were because of
physical illness and most of the
others involved academic difficul-
ties.

‘To sum the matter up, I do not
believe that there is any real cause
for concern.

Samuel 'R. Spencer, Jr.
Dean of Students

Question: If a student would like
to suggest a change in the present
curriculum, such as the inclusion
of a new course, how and through
whom may he best accomplish this?

Answer: Should a student be in-
terested in suggesting a new course
for our curriculum ‘he should first
of all contact either the professor
who would teach the course or the
chairman of the department in
which the course is to be offered.
The department involved may have
good reasons for not offering such
a course or it may be interested
in learning how much student in-
terest exists for such a course.

Assuming that the department
approves the student’s request, the
next step involves the Curriculum
Committee of the Faculty. The de-
scription of the course together
with the reasons for its offering is
presented to the Committee for dis-
cussion and action: If it is approved
by the Curriculum Committee, its
description is included in the next
college catalogue.

C. J. Pietenpol
Dean of the Faculty

Question: Under what conditions
would « break between semesters,
say two days, be possible? Has such
an intersemester vacation been at-
tempted before?

Answer: The Southern Regional
Accrediting Association, of which
Davidson is a member, requires 45
contact teaching hours in’ every
subject each semester. Davidson is
geared to run on éxactly that many
.semester-class hours. The introduc-
tion of a two day vacation in the
middie of the academic year would
require, therefore, an extension of
days at the beginning or the end
of the year, or the removal of one
day from both the Christmas and
Spring vacations (one from each
semester.)

A College regulation requires
that school open on the Wednesday
nearest the 15th of September. This
date, the starting point from which
the yearly calendar evolves, has
been determined for numerous rea-
sons, such as allowing for the
proper length of time between the
closing of summer school and the
opening of the regular academic
year. An addition of days, at the
beginning of the year would, as
things now stand, thus be imprac-
tical.

An addition at the end of the
year similarly meets with numer-
ous conflicts. The Commencement
Exercises, to be conveniently timed
for the largest number of people,
must be held over the weekend,
and the closing of the final exam
period is determined accordingly.

the State Department.
Athletics

Throughout the fall months
Bunny Perkinson as head of an
Athletic Promotion Committee
worked to boost attendance at
football games and in general to
promote athletics. His committee
got free advertising in the Char-
lotte newspapers and over Char-
lotte radio stations for Davidson
home games, and the Council
pushed student interest in athletics
at every turn. Several attempts
were made at selling tickets in
Charlotte to home games, however
these met with no success.

Before going into activities that
the Council is currently pursuing,
let me say that there are also some
areas where Student Government
has fallen down. An example of
this is the failure of the Court of
Control. In an effort to remedy this
Vernon Hunter has been appointed

Discussion on Curriculum
Changes, Mid-Term Holiday

BILL BONDURANT, Moderstor

An extension of a few days at the
end of the year would throw the
exams into the weekend and Grad-
uation either to an unpopular time
in the middle of the next week or
to ‘the following weekend. In the
latter case, two days at mid-semes-
ter would cost nearly a week at
the year’s end.

Moreover, the Presbyterian Gen-
eral Assembly, regularly scheduled
in early June, requires the attend.
ance of numerous College officials
and would come in direct conflict,
should the date of Commencement
be extended weekend into
June. As of . an extension

erg remains the possiBility of
borrowing a day from the Christ-
mas and Spring vacations. This hes
been suggested to the Student Body
in a previous year and was voted
down. It seems to be, however, the
only practical source.

Several years ago a vacation was
given to the College between se-'
mesters; it lasted only one year.
Among the reasons for its discon-
tinuation was the fact that the Ad-
ministration received numerous let-
ters from the students’ parents
stating that they thought this vaca-
tion was following illogically close
behind the Christmas vacation. The
element of the financial burden
placed on the students who have to
travel long distances for this rela-
tively short vacation was also noted
by many parents.

The Faculty and parents, as well
as the Student Body, seem to be
divided as to whether or not an in-
ter-semester vacation is practical
in view of the forementioned cir-
cumstances. If, however, a large
element of the Student Body, after
considering the conditions that
must be met, would nevertheless
like to petition the Faculty Calen-
dar Committee to institute a vaca-
tion after the first semester exams,
they may count on their petition
receiving the fullest possible con-
sideration.

Question: As things are shaping
up now, approximately when will
the Quips and Cranks be distrib.
uted? What new features are to be
included in the 1956 Annual?

Answer: The Editors of the Quips
and Cranks hope to have the com-
pleted yearbook on campus by May
14 to.allow two days for distribu-
tion before the beginning of the
final exam period. The Annual is
larger this year than in previous
years, giving four pages to each of
the fraternities and including a six-
teen page opening section about
the College. Every football game
of the past season will. be repre-
sented by a photograph. The ones
included which were taken at off-
campus games by photographers
from other colleges are the result
of a sports coverage and yearbook
exchange with other institutions.

The 1956 Yearbook will contain
a kodachrome print and an aerial
shot of the campus. Old English
script will be used intermittantly.
The entries for the Beauty Queen
section have been sent to Mr. Jon
Whitman, one of the ‘ten top illus-
trators and artists in the nation,
and will be returned in February.
His decision is to be withheld un-
til publication of the Annual. The
cover of the book will be black;
the second color, dark green. Gen-
erally speaking, the Yearbook is
progressing on schedule. Any stu-
dents who can assist the Editors by
typing will certainly be welcomed
in the offices of the Quips and
Cranks.

to head a committee to investigate
the Court. There have been other
instances where the Student Gov-
ernment could have been more ac-
tive. We can only say to this that
Student Government is trying to
improve and to be active and ef-
fective in any issue where com-
bined student feeling is evident.
This is what Student Govern-
ment is doing. We invite your sup-
port, your criticism, end your
thought. The Student Council feels
that this first semester has been
®@ good one. We are grateful for
the fine cooperation given by Dr.
Cunningham, the faculty, and the
administration. We hope thet the
coming semester will go as well.
Davidson College is blessed with
many strong end good traditions.
it is our hope that Student Govern-
ment will grow in the tradition of
being the authoritative and unified
expression of student opinion.
