MOTHER'S DAY.

Next Sunday, May 12, is Mother's
Day. Roses—white and red—will be
available in the parlor of the Library
after 10 o'clock. “Be sure and come early
so as to get a good flower before church.
The following poem was written by a
member of the class of '17, and may ap-
ply to everyone:

I wear a rose on Mother’s Day,

And she seems near, tho far away.
For in its spotlessness I see

My mother’s matchless purity.

And all its fragrance, soft and rare,
My mother’s sweetness doth declare.
The rose’s beauty then unfold,

And half my mother’s is not told.

T wear the rose above my heart,

For mother owns of me that part.

SUMMER WORK.

The opportunities for landing jobs are
probably as good this year as they have
been for a long time. The question is,
what kind of work to do? Are we go-
ing to look for work that will be for
our own interests alone, or are we going
to realize that the country is up against
the biggest job she has ever faced, and
that she needs help—and needs it bad.
The papers have been blazing with ad-
vertisements for men, to work in ship-
yards, cantonment construction and oth-
er camps, and on the farms. Ships, arms,
food and men cannot be received too
fast in France, and it’s up to every able-
bodied citizen to do all in his power to
help. The soldier hasn’t the only job
to lick the Kaiser. The farm is the es-
sential source of national endurance, and
is in critical need of men to work it.
Good money is offered workers in ship-
yard and camps, a man thus being able
to please his country and pocketbook at
the same time. It should not only be
the privilege but the duty of everv col-
lege man to do some kind of work this
summer that will help the Allies toward
victory.

Ine DAVIDSONIAN, May 8, 1918

STAY FOR COMMENCEMENT.

Commencement this year, in reaction
from the slim and much-talked-of occa-
sion of last year, promises to be record-
breaking, both in number of visitors and
variety of attractions. Patriotism does
not require a short, quiet and meagre
affair, ‘The many visitors will be cor-
dially invited and heartily welcomed to

the campus, and it’s up to more of the,

students. to stay over. “The underclass-
men owe it to the Senior class and to
themselves. The Juniors should stay and
find out how to do it next year, as many
of them have never seen a college com-
mencement. Everyone will enjoy it,
and the more students that stay over, the
better will be the occasion. Help make
this year’s commencement a big success.

408 STARS. \

According to confirmed statistics in
the office, Davidson now has 408 men
in direct military service. And we can
well be proud of it. A small army in
itself, thirty-five per cent again larger
than the current student body, and
twenty per cent of the living Davidson
men. Reports show a little over four
hundred, but our men in the camps
claim that 450 is not exceeding a safe
estimate. This brings home the fact that
all names of Davidson men in service
have not been sent in. For the sake of
preserving the history of Davidson and
Davidson men, everyone is urged, wheth-
er alumni, students, or any who have an
interest for the college, to send in to the
college authorities or THe Davinson-
IAN any names of men they may know
to be in the service, but not recorded on
the Honor Roll. Help us keep the serv-
ice flag on page five up to date.

The big flag hanging in front of
Chambers is sadly behind in the number
of stars. The correct number will fill
this lag—and then some. It.is sobering
to think about it. but one blue star now
on the flag should be replaced by a gold
one; and if only we could feel assured
that no others will have to be changed
to gold! Steps should be taken before
the year is up by the proper persons to
bring the flag up to date, and to see to
the purchasing of another flag (if neces-
sary) to supplement this one.

SENIOR'S CREDITS.

Several things this year with regard
to certain Seniors’ journey toward their
diplomas call for adjustment. A man,
hoping to win his degree on May 29,
1918, finds to his dismay in the middle
of April that he still has some entrance
requirements to work off, or that he
lacks a ticket necessary for graduation.
He hurriedly tries to arrange matters,
finally “jacking” off the missing work in
two or three weeks, or less, consequently
getting nothing out of it whatever. Of
course, it is true that every man should
keep track of his work during all four
years, and should catch up, if behind;
however, forgetfulness is a prime char-
acteristic of a student, and a little jog-
ging of memory now and then never
comes amiss. It has been suggested and
discussed by a number of Seniors that
the college authorities send to each man
at the end of his Junior year a statement
of his credits, and also requirements for
the completion of his college course. If
this is done, a man may know just
what he has done, what tickets he must
elect the following year, and what back
work he must make up, in order com-
fortably to win a coveted diploma.

DERATING AT DAVIDSON.

A few statistics concerning the history
of intercollegiate debating at Davidson
might be of interest. For ten years now
Davidson has been in the forensic arena.
from which she emerges this spring with
a total of twelve victories and six de-
feats. Subjects have covered widely
varying topics: municipal, national and
international; political and economic.

The first intercollegiate debate was held
in 1909 and to the present date either
one or two have been held each year.
Davidson has defeated Wake Forest
three times, losing to them twice. Wof-
ford has been defeated twice, and South
Carolina once, two having been lost to
the latter. Ina series with Emory, Da-
vidson last year won the third and last
contest. Davidson has split even with
Roanoke; and has defeated once, Clem-
son, Erskine, and Lafayette. A percent-
age of .666 is pretty fine, and considering
the records Davidson debaters have
made, there is a bright prospect of our
getting into a Debating League, which
will insure two and maybe three good
debates every year. Intercollegiate de-
hating at Davidson has a bright future
indeed.

TILL WE MEET.

As this will be the last issue for the
collegiate year, ‘He DavipsoNiaAN
vishes to take this opportunity to wish
“bon voyage” to everyone for the sum-
mer. To you Davidson men in the
Army and Navy, we wish a great sum-
ner; and before college opens next fall
many of us now in the student body will
be with you; possibly all—who can tell
what the next few months will bring
forth? A “bon voyage” will be a reality
to many, and remember: if it means any-
thing to you, we're watching you and
looking to you to do things now for more
than Davidson. Our student body is
gradually thinning out, but not because
of any decline in the college itself. As
‘n 1861, so now, the boys are leaving ‘‘to
fight for what they know to be right;”
and as after the Civil War, Davidson
made great forward strides, so after this
present struggle is all over, our college
will have a brilliant future.

To the students we would wish the
best of luck in their exams looming
ahead, and the pleasantest of summers.
And to the Seniors, who are beginning to
realize what it is to leave the college
they have learned to care for in the past
four years, we would say good-bye, and
here’s to you, as you go out into your
life’s work. ,
