BAD WEATHER HINDERS
BASEBALL PRACTICE. FIRST
GAME NEXT WEDNESDAY.

With only one more week before
the opening game, the Wildcats are
hard at practice, getting in shape
for the fast Old Ridge nine. Bad
weather hampered Coach Henge-
veld’s charges during the past week
to a great degree, but failed to rout
the enthusiasm of the candidates.
The squad of thirty has been putting
in some strenuous work, outdoor

the American Embassy at Petrograd
in 1916, Chief of the Bureau of
Refugees and Relief of the American
Red Cross in Paris 1917-8, etc.

All members of the College, as
well as residents of Davidson, are
cordially invited to attend the ad-
dress of Dr. Devine, which will be-
gin promptly at 7:15. No admis-
sion fee. :

shape for the initial game next Wed-
nesday, on the Hill. ;

Very little change has been made
in the line up of the candidates. In
the infield a battle royal is being
staged for positions. At third, Eris
Cassell, of last year’ s Varsity, is
handling anything that happens by
and bids strong for his former posi-
tion. Long, a Freshman, is also
showing up well at the hot corner.
At the midway station, Ratchford,
last years letter man, is going bet-
ter than ever. The little midget is
right on the job and is looking bet-
ter than he did last year already.
Neal is also being used at the key-
stone sack. On first it is a fight be-
tween McArn and Barnette. Both
are putting up a great scrap and
baseball circles are wondering how
the game next week will start at the
initial sack. At shortstop, Cassell,
F,, still continues to show up to
larid his position. Huffstetler and
Sample however, are pushing him,
and the final occupant of this posi-
tion is also being looked forward to
with interest by the students.

With only one veteran back in the
outfit, the race for positions there
is keen and close. johny Richards
of last years nine, is being used in
left field. He is putting up a bang-
up game and is wielding “old betsy”

in great fashion. The race for the! &

other two positions is close. Those
showing up well are Poe, Shepherd,
Miley, G., and Crawford. Shepherd
is being alternating in the box also.
The race for catcher this year lies
between Johnson, of last year and
Wrenn, former Oak Ridge and A. E.
F. man. Both are putting up a
great game in the receiving de-
partment and the position will be
well taken care of, it matters not
which one wins out. The main-
Stays on the pitching staff are
“Buck” Currie and “Bill” Miley of
last ves twirlers. Both are going
good but the weather has kept both
from strenuous practice. Shepherd,
who pitched on an A. E. F. team in
France is also showing good form.
Sorrells, a portsider, is getting in
good shape and with a couple more
weeks will have his slants working
good. These four are all putting
out a mixed variety of stuff and with
a little warm weather in which to
put something on the old pill, the

ed and Black twirling staft should
be in top notch form.

DR. DEVINE TO LECTURE AT
DAVIDSON.

Friday, March 26th, at 7:15 p. m.,
Dr. Edward T. Devine of New York,
Associate Editor of “The Survey,”
will give an address in Shearer Hall
on “The Three R’s” (Reaction:
Revolution: Reconstruction). The
privilege of having this distinguish-
ed American at Davidson is due to
the N. C. Conference for Social Ser-
vice, which is bringing him to their
annual meeting in Goldsboro.

Dr. Devine is a Doctor of Philos-
ophy of the University of Penn., a
Doctor of Laws of several institu-
tions. Following are titles of some
of his books: “The family and So-
ciat Work,” “Social Forces,”
“Economics,” “The Practice of
Charity,” “The Spirit of Social
Work,” “Efficiency and Relief,” etc.

Dr. Devine had held the following
positions of trust : General Secretary
of N. Y. Charity Organization So-
ciety, Director of New York School
of Philanthropy, Professor of So-
cial Economy in Columbia Univer-
sity, Special Representative of the
Red Cross at San Francisco after
the disastrous earth quake and fire,
same at Dayton, Ohio, after its
disaster of 191

The Davidson Golf Club will hold
its annual spring tournament the
week of March 22 to 27. Prizes
will be given to winners, and the
foremost will be selected to repre-
sent the club against other clubs
which it will meet this spring. This
team will probably be composed of
four to six men.

‘It will be a handicap tournament,
one in which every player has an
equal chance. Do not be discour-
aged from entering this tournament
because you think you Prey too
poorly and therefore would have no
chance, because handicaps will be
arranged so as to put every one on
a par. The players may play in
twosomes or foursomes, the play be-
ing by hole play, and the entire score
counting only when appointing the
team. A team that will make trips
to play clubs and play them on the
hill will be a new feature of the
club this spring, and already
matches have practically . been
obtained with various clubs of this
section. Everybody should look
forward to this as an added source
of pleasure for this spring.

The Golf Club sincerely invites
and hopes everybody will come out
and try the course, and see if they
can not become interested in the
ame. A good showing against
these clubs will help Davidson quite
a bit, and if we are to make a good
showing we must all back it up.
Come out, if you cannot play and
watch the progress of the tourna-
ment during the afternoons of next
week. The Tournament fee will be
very small, the entire amount go-
ing for prizes. All interested reg-
ister immediately at 7 Ga.

STUDENT OF DAVIDSON
BREAKS INTO MUSICAL FAME

At last the desires of the David-
son College students have material-
ized. For a number of years David-
son has lacked a standard edition
of her old war song. This deficiency
has at last been filled through the
energetic efforts of Mr. B. Ernest
Shields. This young embryo com-
poser has set the tune of “Of! Da
vidson” to music and has taken the
responsibility of having it publish-
ed at his own expense.

The words of “O! Davidson” were
written by Mr. E. H. Hamilton, of
the class of '17, and have served the
cohorts of D. C. for the past several
years through thick and thin. Her
athletic teams have heard it resound
through the air in victory and in de-
feat. May it always be so.

BIBLE CLASSES OMITTED
DURING CONFERENCE

Regular Meetings Next Sunday.

“John’s Picture of Worship in
Heaven” will be the topic for dis-
cussion in next Sunday’s lesson.
Only seven more Sundays in which
some of the student body will have
in which to meet in Bible discussion
groups. They should be made _ to
count. Every fellow either makes
or ruins his floor’s attendance.
Which are you?

No Bible classes and only a few
Sunday Schools were held last Sun-
day. However, next Sunday should
see everything going 100 per cent
strong.

GOLF CLUB HOLDS MEETING.

At the last meeting of the Golf
Club the following officers were
elected for the ensuing year: Presi-
dent, Dr. Arbuckle; Secretary,

3, Special Agent of' White; Treasurer, Prof. Wood.

Plans for arousing interest among
the students were discussed and a
spring tournament was decided up-
on. The membership fee was low-
ered from $5.00 to $3.00 for the rest
of this year, and the hope was ex-
pressed that many more of the
fellows would take ladvantage of
this privilege and join.

CAMPUSISMS.

Dr. James Douglas, who has been
indisposed for several days, is about
well,

The first baseball game of the sea-
son 1920 was pulled off Monday aft-
ernoon by Coach Hengeveld’s pro-
teges, According to “Hoyle” the
final score stood 1 to O (more or
less) in Favor of the “Scrubs.”

“Bill” Miley opines that the “old
pill” “was not bein’ swat enough”
at the said game.

C. H. Long and A. F. Fricker spent
the week-end at home.

“Dave” Roberts, ex-’20, ex-editor-
in-chief of the “Livest Wire on the
Hill,” was back on the Hill for the
Volunteer Conference. The confer-
ence showed rare good judgment
when it elected “Dave” president for
the coming year and he showed rarer
judgment when he decided to come
back “home” next year.

C. Howell, ’19, and R. H. Bennet,
16, were back for the Volunteer
Conference.

“Pap” Askew is recovering from
a slight but painful operation.

Those who signed up for the R. O.
T. C. summer camp were “treated”
to a typhoid shot Monday. Mrs.
Robinson was the efficient hostess.

First Sergeant Washam has been
relieved from duty at Morrison Ar-
mory.
