basis by paying board bills the same way
they pay tuition.” The intent of this

is consistent with that of the
PCC penalty system. The system is.

designed to make students aware that
when they join.a house they are
committing themselves for one year.
Members now pay board bills every
term, but this period is used for purposes
of convenience only. Paying board fees
for a year at a time would be financially
burdensome to many students, and

budgeting and planning for a year ahead
would make the already difficult job of

treasurers even harder.

However, students must realize that a
house’s continued economic stability
depends on a long-term, carefully con-
sidered committment by each student,
and the PCC statement of intent and fine
is a means of insuring this committment
is both recognized and fulfilled.

We, the members of the PCC—as
house members and students ourselves
—are not blind to the disadvantages of
the penalty system. We realize it reduces
flexibility and inter-house mobility.
However, we feel that every Davidson

must all take responsibility for the
future of the system if it is to survive.
The PCC has implemented the penalty
system to encourage this type of

this system, and we feel it can work with
the support and cooperation of students.

after the election. In addition,
Wells noted that in the four
years Carter has been in office,
there has been a real increase in
military spending, reversing an
eight year trend of decreasing
defense budgets under two Re-
publican administrations.

Sude argued that the opera-
tion of America’s foreign policy
has declined from the days of
John Foster Dulles, whom he
called ‘‘a man of action,” to
Cyrus Vance, who ‘‘overtalks.”’
Sude accused Carter of having a
vacillating foreign policy in a
world which views vacillation as
a weakness.

Sude called the SALT II
treaty outdated and said that
Reagan, if elected, would work
for a new treaty from scratch.

Fryberger pointed out that
Anderson, as a former foreign
service officer, is experienced in
the international field. One of
Anderson’s basic beliefs is tha t

Cable____

(Continued from page 1)

The Tar River proposal pro-
vides for three basic cable
television services.

The first would feature ten
channels, including commercial
stations already available. This
would cost $7.50 per month.

The second service available
for an extra charge, would
feature 35 channels and include
UPI news, 24-hour weather
reports, and local government
and public service program-
ming. MacCormac said that
not all of these channels would
be offered initially, however.

The third service, which also
carries an extra charge, would
be either ‘‘Showtime” or ‘‘Home
Box Office,’’ both of which
show feature movies.

“power abroad is a function of
power at home,’’ according to
Fryberger. Fryberger insisted
that the U.S. must not be
dependent on other nations for
either energy or security. He
pointed out that a full seven
years after the Arab oil embar-
go, the United States is still
being ‘‘held hostage’’ to Middle
Eastern oil.

Fryberger said that, if elect-
ed, Anderson will take steps to
reduce and eventually eliminate
this dependence. He also said
that Anderson strongly sup-
ports the SALT porcess and will
push for ratification of both the
SALT II and SALTIII accords.
Finally, Fryberger reaffirmed
Anderson’s commitment to sup-
port freedom fighters around
the world.

The major issue in foreign
affairs, according to Stell, is
the use of fouce. Stell said the
Libertarian Party rejects the
view that the United States
should project a powerful mili-
tary presence abroad and use
this power to achieve its ends.
Vietnam, just a few years
behind us, should not be forgot-
ten. But none of the candidates
besides Clark, Stell pointed out,
have addressed the issue of the
Vietnam War, except for Rea-
gan once referring to it as a
“noble cause.’’ America should
learn its lesson from Vietnam,
Stell said. The Libertarians
have learned the lesson, and
stand for a defense posture
which provides security for the
United States without regard to
the security of other countries.

Wells began her comments
about domestic policy by ob-
serving that there have been
many changes since Reagan last
held public office in 1974.

The complexity of our econo-

my, Wells said, makes it impos-
sible for the government to
simply eliminate inflation. The
Carter administration was com-
mitted, however, to an econom-
ic policy which would not hurt
the poor, but would decrease
the federal budget and set
voluntary wage and price stan-
dards. »

In addition, Wells said, Car-
ter is committed to coal, energy
conservation, the use of renew-
able energy resources, civil
service employment, the Hum-
phrey/Hawkins full employ-
ment measures, and welfare
reform. Wells quoted Republi-
can vice-presidential candidate
George Bush in referring to
Reagan’s plan for a thirty
percent tax cut as ‘‘true eco-
nomic voodoo.” The Republican
candidate, she added, advocat-
ed an energy policy supportive
of the energy industry. Wells
also criticized Reagan’s plan to
eliminate the minimum wage.

Reagan is ‘‘intellectually the
best choice’ in domestic issues,
Sude said. Reagan backs a
capitalistic system of public
control rather than a socialistic
one of state control. Sude said
that capitalism maximizes in-
vention and development,
whereas socialism optimizes on-
ly distribution. In response to
Wells’ accusations, Sude said
oil companies are not inherently
bad and that their profits are
only two percent a year.

Reagan stands for reforming
social programs, not eliminat-
ing them, according to Sude. In
addition, Sude claimed that
states can operate well with
their own money and that there
is no reason for that money to
be routed through Washington
and then sent back to the

Budget

’ states.

Finally, Sude noted that un-
der Carter administration poli-
cies, exports account for only
six percent of our Gross Nation-
al Product, although seventeen
percent is normal for an indus-
trial nation. Reagan, he said,
will raise this percentage by
encouraging industrial exports,
especially by small and medium
sized corporations.

Fryberger said Anderson
would reduce inflation by limit-
ing the amount of money print-
ed and by keeping American
capital at home. This could best
be started, he said, by decreas-
ing American dependence of
imported oil with a heavy tax on
gasoline. Anderson, Fryberger
said, would put American capi-
tal back to work, thus decreas-
ing unemployment. Anderson
stands for ‘‘a rebuilding of
America” which would involve
retooling of factories, aid to
inner cities and trust funds for
financially troubled cities, more
mortgage subsidies, more pub-
lic transportation (especially
railroads), and a major restruc-
turing of public education. Fin-
ally, Fryberger outlined Ander-
son’s plans for revisions of the
tax code to help America’s

farmers.

Both Republicans and Demo-
crats increase inflation because
both encourage deficit spending
Stell said. Libertarians, on the
other hand, call for tax cuts, not
just limits on tax increases.
Stell then outlined Clark’s eco-
nomic policy. Clark would in-
crease the zero tax bracket to
$7500 and call for a fifty percent
cut in all other tax brackets. In
addition, he said, Libertarians
would repeal federal gift taxes
and the windfall profits tax.
According to Stell this would
result in a 180 billion dollar tax
cut in the first year. To offset
this, there would be a 201 billion
dollar cut in federal spending.
Stell said that 50 billion of this
would come from the defense

department budget.

Athletics Department will face reduced funding,
Davidson said. In fact, work is now in progress to
determine how much each sport received from last
year’s budget.

In 1978-79, the last year for which figures are
available, 30% of the athletics budget ($212,000) went
to football; 27% ($193,000) to basketball; 28%
($199,000) to other sports; and 15% ($103,000) to
physical education, according to figures released last
year by College President Samuel Spencer.

The athletics budget does not include athletics
scholarships or game expenses, Davidson said. These
two items cost $389,000 in 1978-79, but. were partially
offset by $291,000 in game income and contributions
from the Wildcat Club.

Physical Plant

The College spent $1.2 million to operate and
maintain the physical plant in 1979-80, Davidson
said. This expense includes the upkeep of the
College grounds and the academic buildings, the

‘payment of utilities, and the cost of campus
security .

Davidson said $1.2 million has been budgeted
for the physical plant for this year, but expects
the College will exceed that figure. He explained
that emergency expenses -- repair of broken power
lines, for example -- necessitate spending beyond
what: the College budgets for the physical plant.
There is a contengency fund to cover anticipated
emergency outlays, Davidson said.

Auxiliary Enterprises
The College spent $2.2 million -- about 20 per-

| cent of its operating budget -- on auxiliary enter-

prises in 1979-80, according to Davidson.

The auxiliary enterprises are generally break-even
operations for the College. They are funded and
used almost exclusively by students and include the
dormitories, the student store, the laundry, the Pat-
terson Court eating houses, Carnegie Guest House,
and a few smaller operations.

General Institutional E
General institutional expenses include ‘‘almost

thing imaginable,” Davidson said, and cost the College
$1.1 million in 1979-80, 10% of the

~The Development Department, i office, and

Communications Department account for half of thes
spending. The rest goes for staff benefits and gen-
eral expenses, which include legal fees, mainten-
ance agreements on office machines, computer service
Convocation and Commencement, professional assoc-
iation dues, and several other 8. _.

Other Exp ures

The rest of the budget -- $2.3 million or 21%
in 1978-79 e funds the following, according to
Davidson:

—$297,000 or 3% for administrative costs, which in-
cludes the President’s Office, the ‘Buisness Office,
the Comptroller's office, and the Personnel Office;

—$639,000 or 6% for student services, which in-
clude the Admissions Office, College Union activities,
not funded by the student activity fee, the infirmary,
the Registrar’s Office, the Dean of Students’ Office,
Counseling services, the minister to students, and the
Experiential Programs and Life/Work Planning Office;

—$521,000 or-. 4.8% for the _ library;

—$657,000 or 6.0% for financial aid awarded by the
College;and

—$200,000 or 2% contributed towards the building
of new dormitories.
