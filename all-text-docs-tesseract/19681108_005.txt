Davidson And The Southe

(Lest of a Series)
By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Writer

Today, Davidsdn College
has come to a crossroads in
intercollegiate athletics, and
possibly the whole future of
the sports program depends
upon which route Davidson
chooses to follow.

If it so decides, Davidson
can keep driving straight
ahead down the rocky path
of the Southern Conference,
bound for a probable dead.
end in athletic advancement
and improvement. By stay-
ing in a weakened and dying
conference that restrains a
championship caliber basket.
ball team, rolis over the
Wildcats in certain other
sports, and contributes very
little to the schedule of most
Davidson teams, Davidson
would face an athletic future
more frustrating and fruit-
less than in the past.

A second possible choice
is thet Davidson withdraw
from the Southern and join
a more suitable feague, such
as the surrounding Caro-
linas Conference. Already
more Carolinas Conference
teams (plus Pembroke, St.
Andrews, Wofford, and sev-
eral other area small col.

feges) ptay Davidson Col-
lege in athletic events than

bers, and these small schools
match the Wildcats with
surprising results.

Davidson could not help
but profit in every sport but
basketball if participating in
the Carolinas. The minor
teams (everything but foot-
ball and basketball) would
be playing in a league with
equal ability and scholar-
ships while the football team
would be playing fine small
college squads, such as
Lenoir Rhyne, second-ranked
in the nation.

Furthermore, and realistic-
ally, considering the size of
the student body and the
number of scholarships
issued, Davidson is a small
college and should be play-
ing a small college schedule.

As for the basketball team.
“we would do everything
that we possibly could to try
to let your school continue
to compete in the NCAA
against the type of opposi-
tion it's capable of playing in
basketball,” remarked H. C.
Hawn, Commissioner of the
Carolinas Conference.

tion to make promises that

If you go to the football game tomorrow with VMI
at Richardson Field, look at the flags that decorate
the top of Johnston Gym. For each school in the
Southern Conference, a flag is flown with the name
of the school on it. Unfortunately for the academic
repute of Davidson, The Citadel is spelled as “The
Citidel” on a blue flag. Maybe they'll change it after

last Saturday's game....

Last Wednesday, a reporter from Sports Illustrat-
ed visited Davidson to rate our basketball team. He

watched practice and was

duly impressed with Dave

Moser and Mike Maloy. I don’t think we'll have to
worry about the S$! number one jinx but we probably
will be in the pre-season top five....

It’s rumored that Maloy will have his picture on
the cover of SI this fall in their college basketball
edition. Along with Charlie Scott of North Carolina
and Mike Casey of Kentucky, he will represent the
basketball power of southern schools. The three play-

ers will be posing in front of a plantation mansion or

«something like that... .

If you have been glancing at the basketball maga

zines over in the Hub or Mary’s,

you’ve probably

noticed we’ve been rated from fifth to 20th in the pre-
season polls. Most of the predictions list UCLA on top
for obvious reasons but after that it becomes a free-

for-all.

Still, I remember one magazine which looked like

a Papal Bull or a Catholic newsletter. Notre Dame was
listed first ahead of UCLA and out of the remaining
eight schools in the top ten, five were Catholic. St.
Bonaventure, LaSalle, St. Josephs, Marquette, and St.
Johns were all lauded while our fine Presbyterian

school was left out. We don
Bonnie or LaSalle anymore

’t have to worry about St.
because the NCAA police

force restricted their teams from any post season

games... .

All the seniors will remember Jim Hyder who is
now helping out in the admissions office. It was three
years ago when he was one of the few college players
in the nation who was also a manager and kept charts
on the bench. That year Lefty only had nine players
and needed ten for practice scrimmages, so Hyder was

given a uniform.

Jimmy finally did have his day. All of us clearly
remember his coming off the bench in the second West
Virginia game and sinking a two-handed set shot from
half court. It was his shot that brought on West Vir-
ginia coach Bucky Water's statement, “You know
you're really bad when the manager comes off the
bench and scores.” Hyder was a skin if there ever

was one.

Davidson would be free of
conference regulations in
basketball, but it might be
arranged,” he said.

In other words, there Is
a possibliity that Devidson
could still compete in a con-
ference-atmosphere with all
the conference advantages
and on its own level and
yet be able to pley basket-
ball as an independent.

“If something like that is
possible," said Virginia
sportswriter Marty Horne,
“then Davidson would have
the ideal set-up."’ Dick Ham-
merstrom, a Charlotte
writer, was even more em-
phatic. “It would be one
helluva improvement over
life'in the Southern, wouldn't
it?”

The third route that David-
son can follow would be to
join the growing ranks of
once-discontented members
of conferences across the na-
tion that have become more
successful‘ as independents.
Among these colleges are
Georgia Tech, Tulane, and
ex-Southerners Virginia Tech
and West Virginia.

By becoming an independ-
ent, Davidson would forfeit
its privileges as a_confer-
ence member, such as assur-

ed schedule, respectable of-
ficiating, and post-season
play in the NCAA tournament
or a minor bowl. Davidson,
however, could fill its sports
schedules easily (especially
since there are not that many
conference games to drop)
and would have no trouble
finding officials.

An at-large bid in the NCAA
tournament or even a bid to
the NIT could easily be earn-
ed by a basketball team such
as the Wildcats have, and the
other sports probably would
not win an NCAA berth
through the Southern any-
way.

By becoming an indepen-
dent, Davidson would be just
that — independent. Free

gulations, the rulings, and
the continual mismatches,
both for and against us, the
Wildcat basketball teams
could play the likes of UCLA,
Kentucky, Villanova, and
Notre Dame instead of Fur-

The Wildcat soccer team
began this season with high
hopes of winning the South.
ern Conference title. Last
Saturday, however. _ their
hopes vanished.in defeat at
the feet of The Citadel.

The team must now con.
centrate on achieving a win-
ning season, a task which is
made difficult by a tough
remaining schedule.

Despite two goals of its
own against The Citadel and
one which a Bulldog player
contributed to the cause, the

team was unable to sustain
the attack and lost, 5-3.

Coach Fogleman was visib
ly upset and said, ‘‘We play
ed very badly.”

He blamed the morning
loss only on the team. “The
players can't party all night
and expect to play their best
the next morning.”’ he said.
“We played like we were
dead.” ,

Fogleman was not.-the only
one upset with the play. The
mood was echoed by most of

the players.
“The whole season has
been disappointing.’ said

another fine performance.
Martin called him ‘‘the work.
horse of the team, who al.
ways works hard to im-
prove.” :

Also turning in good per-
formances were Reeves

_Chris Sikes.

The Wildcats now turn
their attention to the South.
ern Conference meet at East
Carolina on Monday. William
and Mary is the heavy fav-
orite, with ECU, Furman,
and VMI expected to finish
ahead of Davidson. Whittle is
counting on. beating Rich-
mond and says a good effort
can top VMI.

Martin said that he hadn't
planned to enter the race
but did because ‘‘the boys
egged me on.” Earlier in
the season he had run with
the team in practice, but he
hadn't worked out for several
weeks before the meet.

As a Davidson cross-coun-
try runner Martin was an all

tion in 1960-61-62. He was

cause we have more poten.
tial than ‘we have shown.”

Bill Horton, a junior wing,
agreed. ‘‘We should be 9-0
now, but we have never
really played as a team." he
said. He added that the of
fense has not been consist-
ent enough to present a for-
midable scoring threat.

Freshman goalie Steve Cul.
bertson said the team's re-
cord could have been. better.
He adds that the team is
weak on goal kicks, start-
ing an offense and maintain-
ing bal! control. ‘“‘We just
don't get enough shots,”’ he
said.

All of the comments came
before Wednesday's 4-1 loss
to Duke. .

In that Davidson's play
was more consistent, but the
team was hampered by in
juries and slowed by illness.

Team captain Cliff Patter-

son sat out the game with
an ankle sprain which he
received in the Citadel game
on what he called ‘a routine
block play.”
- Wing Roger Paterson play-
ed in spite of a virus infec-
tion which had knocked him
out of practice this week.

Davidson's only goal came
on an inside shot by Carter.
He took a pass from John
Bruner directly in front of
the goal and slapped it in.

Carter said after the game
that the offense against Duke
was ‘‘great at times but
sloppy at others.”

The loss to the Blue Devils
lowered the Wildcats's sea-
son record to a disappoint-
ing 4.5-1, and the remainder
of the season is not easy.

The team meets Emory
University this afternoon at
3 p.m. at the Davidson soc-
cer field. Next week the team
plays Applachian before the
state meet in Raleigh next

Besides the loss in prestige

tinued, “Davidson is the onl

Dave Fagg. who works with
the defensive unit, praised
the team for a tremendous

the area of effort. He singled
out Steve Butler and Lew

tackles even on the opposite
