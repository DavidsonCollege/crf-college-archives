The Harry S Truman Scholarship Foundation was established in 1976 by an
Act of Congress as the nation’s living memorial to the 33rd president.

scholar by the Board of Trustees of the Harry S Truman Scholarship Foundation.

The Truman Scholarship, which carries an annual stipend of $7,000 per year
for each of the last two years of college as well as the first two years of graduate
study, was awarded on April 14 to 102 college sophomores who “demonstrated

a firm commitment to public service.”

The selection process began in October with the interviewing and selection

of potential candidates by appointed faculty representatives of over 2,000 col-
leges and universities. A total of 952 nominations were received by the Founda-
tion. Davidson’s nominees were Finch and sophomoge James Earl.

Finch is the second Davidson student to be named a Truman scholar in recent
years. Junior Mark Sandy was named a scholar in 1985.

AIC proposes new budget

pays $10 per year and about
$1,200 of the BSC budget is so-
cial. Obviously, most of the stu-
dents there are not from the same
socio-economic background as
the typical Davidson student so
generally they just don't have as
much money. Yet I feel, person-
ally, that $10 is not enough. I
think it’s fair that we ask that they
contribute a little more to their
budget than $10 each year.

“In addition, they don’t solicit
their alumni for money, which is a
common practice of other Patter-
son Court houses, and we feel that
they could do a better job by sol-
iciting their alumni for a little
help. We still thought that $4,500
was certainly a good budget. If
there is an obvious avenue there
for funds and an organization is
not taking advantage of it, then we
feel that it wouldn’t be quite as
justified to give a whole lot of
money to that organization.

“Rape Crisis, forexample, got
a $5,000 government grant this
year. They only asked ATC for
$355 because the money they got

from the grant was stipulated for
use only in training. We gave
them their request to meet minor
expenses like postage and public-
ity.”

Other considerations also led
the ATC to refuse to meet some
requests, Gordon said. “Hobart
Park is something we struggle
with every year and if you look at
he budget you'll see that they
asked for $3,500 and we granted
them $2,500. They haven’t pub-
lished an issue yet this year, and
they like to come out with an issue
late in the year, which is under-
standable, because that’s when
the Vereen Bell and other awards
come out. They'd like to have
award-winning submissions in
Hobart Park, which makes a lot of
sense.

“Well, they've got a 64-page
issue Coming out very soon and
that’s going to be followed up
right on its heels by another short
issue. But the problem is that it’s
expected that they have one issue
in the fall and one issue in the
spring, but it has not worked out
that way — there have been prob-

May Day celebrates women

The Davidson College Union hosted its second annual “Celebrate Women:
A May Day Festival” event yesterday, organized by the president of the
Women’s Concerns Committee, junior Sarah Smith. The celebration included

singing and poetry readings and provided free refreshments of fruit and stir-fry

lems with the organization each
year. It’s kind of difficult to keep
allocating a lot of money when the
product is not as good as it could
be.”

“Hobart Park is important at
Davidson — there’s no doubt
about that, because there are some
creative writers here and they
need some place to publish their
work. What we recommended
was one year-end issue of 100
pages, and we calculated that
$2,500 would be enough for that.
The editors would like two 64-
page issues because they feel that
has been that it hasn’t worked out
to two 64-page issues. So we'd
like to see a big year-end issue —
that’s all we can recommend.
They'll get their budget and
they'll do what they want to with
it. We can’t tell them anything.”

Gordon said that club sports,
which requested $9,028, only re-
ceived $7,500 primarily due to a
misunderstanding on the part of
the men’s club tennis team. “They
asked for $2200 — money to buy
graphite tennis racquets, money to
buy shoes, money to buy uniforms

— and that’s not what club tennis
is for.”

Gordon said that the cost of
club sports might also decrease as
a result of the inactivity of the
water ski team and the possible
varsity status of the women’s club
volleyball team.

Gordon said that The Davidso-
nian, which requested $15,000,
received only $14,000 in appro-
priations because the ATC felt

that Davidsonian advertising and
subscription revenue could be in-
creased substantially.

The ATC also appropriated
funds to Quips & Cranks, the col-
lege annual, even though the pub-
lication had not submitted a for-
mal request for money. Quips &
Cranks did not submit a request
because no one has sought its '86-
’87 editorship. The ATC pro-
posed the continuation of Quips &
Cranks '85-'86 appropriation of
$26,000.

Gordon explained that he was
asked to chair the ATC by SGA

tries are so great that they could

had served on the council during
his sophomore year and because
he was not a member of the SGA.
Gordon solicited and selected the
five student members of the ATC,
of whom two are SGA senators
and three are from the student
body at large. His selections were
approved by the SGA.

this year there was no fall issue,
and the year before that there was
some misuse of money. We'd like
to see Hobart Park come out with
two strong issues, but we have to
act upon what has happened in the
past and the history of it thus far

The ATC is independent of the
SGA and must be chaired by a stu-
dent who is not a member of the
SGA.

Gordon said that the other stu-
dent members of the ATC were
senior Kevin Burke, juniors Shel
Robinson and Christie Johnson,
and sophomores Sabrina Walton
and Ken Mobley. Other members
from the college staff are Dean of

Conference focuses on Central America

By JIM DILLON

Approximately 50 people in-
cluding students, faculty, staff
and the community participated in
the first Dean Rusk Conference.
Chairman of the student planning
committee Dee Reynolds said he
was pleased with the response.

“I was quite pleased with the
mixture of people who attended,”
Reynolds said. “There were
freshmen, international students,
seniors, staff, faculty and mem-
bers of the community. It was an
all around mixture of people, and
that pleased me that it didn’t just
appeal to a particular group.”

The conference opened with a
presentation by Allen Wells, an
Appalachian State University pro-
fessor of modern and colonial

Latin American history who gave
a historical perspective on Central
America. Davidson Spanish prof-
fessor Lois Kemp, who led a dis-
cussion group at the conference,
said his presentation revolved
around details of American inter-
vention in Central America.

“He went into the long tradi-
tional U.S. habit on intervening
whenever there’s a government
we cannot control. He gave a very
good overview. He was very dy-
namic, and he knew his facts,”
Kemp said.

Wells discussed the current
controversy over proposed $100
million spending to militarily sup-
port the contra rebels in Nicaragua
supported by President Reagan.
Kemp said that Wells’ view is that

the money would be “largely sym-
bolic” but actually minute in com-
parison to total U.S. money spent
in Hispanic America.

“Nine and a half million dol-
lars actually goes for military aid

to Central America and generally -

a certain amount goes for
economic aid. That's an enor-
mous amount of money, and $100
million seems like nothing,”
Kemp said.

After dinner Friday night,
Duncan Marle, an anthropology
professor at Dartmouth College,
presented a slide show and spoke
of government sponsored vio-
lence against the Highland Maya
Indians in Guatemala. Reynolds
said Earle estimated that as many
as 150,000 Indians have disap-
peared or died by such means in

the past 10 years.

“That’s 150,000 out of a total
Indian population of only five mil-
lion so in many ways it is
genocide. He talked about the
type of effect that has a Indian so-
ciety and culture,” Reynolds said.

Marte has lived with the High-
land Maya Indians about half of
the last 10 years and can speak one
Indian language and can “handle
another,” according to Kemp.
Kemp said Earle expressed an an-
thropological view of the situa-
tion.

“Almost half of the population
of the country is expendable as far
as the government is concemed.
Four hundred villages disap-
peared in 1982-83. These are
whole villages not just individu-
als, but that is the government’s

answer to any suspicion concern-
ing Indians. The Guatemalan
army is one of the most sophisti-
cated, almost to the point of being
computerized. It is also one of the
most effective and brutal, and
their enemy is the Indian_who
might want to change anything,”
Kemp said.

Kemp: noted that — in
Guatemala, the guerrillas are not
capable of understanding the In-
dians because there are 23 differ-
ent language groups in the nation
and seven more in a nearby Mexi-
can state. The existence of so
many Indian language groups is a
situation unique to Guatemala.

Saturday moming, the group
divided into four smaller discus-
