A Survey about the Campus Computer

Have you used the college’s computer
this year? If so, what for? Are you aware
of the things it can do, such as paper,
letter, and lab-report typing as well as
programming in several languages?
These are just a few of the questions
that came up at a meeting last week in
which several students discussed the
computing services currently available
to them. The meeting was called in an
attempt to bring to the surface ideas,
suggestions, and criticisms that students
have about the college’s new computer

system. Most of the criticisms came in
the form of requests that terminal room
hours be extended at night and on wee-
kends, and the system was praised for
its word-processing capabilities:

It was pointed out that the Computer
Center staff needs to know more about
how the average Davidson student feels
about the computer in order to work to-
wards providing better services. The
questionnaire here is being distributed
this week in an effort to determine the
general campus attitude toward the

Computer Center and its facilities. It
was drawn up by the students who met
last week, and every student is request-
edtocomplete one. _

There will be envelopes on each
dorm hall as well as in each eating
house/fraternity, in the Union, the
Commons, and the terminal rooms. In
addition.to the copies that will be dis-
tributed to each room on campus, you
may use the copy provided here. We ask
that every student, whether he or she
uses the computer or not, please fill one

out and return it to one of the collection
envelopes by Friday, May 7. The results
of the survey will provide the Computer
Center with an up-to-date idea of what
the campus attitude toward the com-
puter is, helping them better serve the

needs of everyone.

You may circle more than one answer
where appropriate. Please complete
this survey only if you are a student.
Thank you.
