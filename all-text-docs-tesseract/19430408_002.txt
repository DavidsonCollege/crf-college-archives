Fraternities ....

It is now evident that few, if any, of
the national fraternities on the campus
will be able to maintain active chapters
next year. “Theretore, we suggest that
some action be taken soon either by the

. Pan-Hellenie Council or the administra-

tion toward the adoption of a unified
policy for the immediate future of the
Greeks.

Weare of the opinion that the decision
should be to discontinue all such national
social fraternities at Davidson for the
duration, Vhere may be‘one or two fra-
ternities who expect to have enough

to earry on actively.

The financial problem alone prohibits
such an attempt. Five or six boys can
not possibly finance the rent and upkeep
of a lodge for a year. 1f some are count

year to keep things going, they should re

uncertain.

Even if some fraternity should find it
possible, through some financial reserve
or from gifts, to continue their activities,
it would be unfair to the others if they
were permitted to carry on, Of course
it would be impossible-to prevent “un-
derground™ meetings of those who re-
main in school, but the pledging and
initiation of new men should be strictly

prohibited.

We hate to see fraternity life end at
Davidson, even in the face of such a
crisis. Nevertheless a uniform policy
of disbanding all for the duration seems
to be the only fair solution to the prob-
lem, Some say that there has been so
much pressure in the past against fra-
ternities at Davidson that they would
never be established again here if dis-
continued. We believe that fraternities
have proven their worth at Davidson in
the promotion of character, fellowship,
and scholarships and that after the war

College Training Detachment in the
country, ~

Intermission between classes at
Shearer Hall proved quite interest-
ing last week when several of our
musically inclined members obliged
by pouring a fusilade of jive our
way. Mister Kontos officiated at
the piano and gave out with a
stream of boogie woogie that rock-
ed us in our seats and set our feet
to tapping. Gene Kurtz picked up
a clarinet and after a few timid
wheezes, comfortably proped him,
self against the wall and gave out
with some mighty sweet licks. Mr.
Lagges drapped himself around a
huge tuba and provided a rhythm-
ical background of deep notes.
Messrs. Latchen and Lakowski con-
ceived the fiendish idea of combining
their talent on the drums, and to-
gether assembled an assortment of
beats as complex, if not as well
spaced, as any Krupa could produce.
At times the rhythm section was a
bit independent and domineering but
the piano, reed and brass rallied to
the cause and soniehow made them-
sel¥es audible in spite of the din.
Mr. Lakowski was quite entertain-
ing as he beat the bass, and daringly
jeopardized his hand by methodi-
cally reaching out to silence the
vibrating cymbals, so vigorously and
constantly struck by Latchen. You
were swell fellows, thanks for the
show.

A few days later we sat in quiet
admiration while pilot Captain
Pharr spoke to us about the various
tasks ahead of us before we re-
ceive our wings. The Air Corps is
well represented in Captain Pharr
and we could do nothing but listen
intently to his enlightening talk
and gaze covetingly at his silver
wings.

have
“Chew Terbaccy spit on the
ground, twirl your partner around
‘n round.” Excluding the expector-
ating, that’s just what many of us
did Saturday ‘fore last in Davidson

an at Queens College. In the
Davdson High School Gym you
might have recognized among the
twirling gryating mass of smiling
faces, those of Messrs. Krug, Kul-
backi, Kulpa, and Sgt. Beiard. All
bent on delving into the intricacies
of the dance of the barn, we found
it less confusing and much more fun
to take part in the affair than to
stand at a distance attempting to
analyze it.

The joviality of Johnny Lakatosh
mixed well with the contagious
smile of Bill Kruise as they jointly
M. C'd the Stunt Night show. Our
boys were quite entertaining despite
the fact that «their act was im-
promptu and, altho they basked in
the footlights they were as much in
the dark as the audience as to what
would happen next.

The dance is the thing apparently,
and touching off the high spot of
the week-end was our Group Dance
to the inviting rhythmical cadence
set forth by Buck Arsher's Band
On Saturday evening at Fireman's
Hall in Charlotte. The presence of
our C. O. Major Bonner and Mrs.
Bonner gave our affair an official
air and yet their friendly mingling
and — whole-hearted participation
identified them as the acting Ma and
Pa of one big happy family. Skep-
tical ? The news photographs
taken are being furiously bid for by
nationally known dentrifice manu-
facturers for their en masse glis-
tening smile advertising values.
Kenneth Lamster and June Senger
of Milwaukee, added a tender ro-
mantic note to the evening by an-
nouncing their engagement. Con-
gratulations, but gosh Ken, isn't one
war enough? Lts. Brooks, Gelinkn
and Zindel joined in the dance,
while all were reminded of the ab-
sence of our fun-loving Lt. Warley
by a pathetically lonesome and un-
claimed pack of mints, his delight,
lying on the concession counter—
waiting, waiting, waiting. While
we're at the refreshment stand
let's thank Whitey Kreps for serv-
ing the cokes, and also click a few
pop bottles together in appreciation
of the efforts put forth by all who
made our affair a success—espe;
cially the girls. It's midnight al-
ready-and-like-Cinderellas-the-girls
must go, so it's back to our busses
soldiers. Steam those windows with
rousing songs; now lean a bit for-
ward and coax the laboring bus
along. The cool night air is fresh
and invigorating as we leave the
panting bus and make our way in
the general direction of the campus,
our barracks, and bed. Gosh but
we're tired,

The epitomy of horror is a term

another old favorite, The Wolfman,
billed to play for two days in place
