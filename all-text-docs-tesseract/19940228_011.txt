with Geoff Grkae
Steve Wariner
returns, rip-
ened with age
and inspiration

All of us, from time to time,
feel aneed to escape the monotony
of everyday life and leave the rig-
ors of responsibility behind. But
as that responsibility tends to over-
whelm our spontaneity, very few
actually take to the trail. Even fewer
leave the map at home.

For the past several years,
Steve Wariner has shunned’ that
monotony and, with guitar in hand,
has returned to preach the value of
an occasional blind journey. His
latest album, Drive, is an excep-
tional compilation of travel and
love songs from a seasoned vet-
eran of the country (my editors are
still uncapitalizing Country! Will
my faithful readership sit idly by
without protest?) music arena.

In his single, “Drivin’ and
Cryin’,” Steve sings “Sometimes
in Texas ain’t nothin out there/A
man could get lost headed for no-
where/That’s where I’m goin’
without you/At least the nights
won’t desert me.”; Those lines
exemplify the tone of the album.

Driveincludes one othersingle
that made the radio play lists. “If I
Didn’t Love You,” one of my top
ten of 1993, portrays the moving,
practiced voice that provoked this
review. That same emotion, and
some great lyrics, carry most of the
album’s songs.

The quality lyrics in “Missing
You” are typical of Drive: “Istarted
a letter, I stared at your name/
There wasn’ ta line that didn’t echo
my pain/There was nosoundatall/
But the slow lonely fall/Of an un-
spoken tear.”

For David Wilcox fans want-
ing to buy their first country CD,
Steve’s latest is the perfect choice.
Several songs, especially “Mar-
ried toa Memory,” betray Steve as
a fan of that neo-folk troubadour.

For all its pleasant smooth-
ness, however, Drive does have its
potholes. “It Won’t Be Over You”
and the title track come off a little
stale, and many songs suffer under
the weight of too many instruments.

Without a doubt, Drive leaves
the best for last. “Sails" reveals
Steve’s classical ability and leaves
us pushed off, just a little bit, from
Melville’s insular Tahiti, into an
inspiring sea: “Sails are just like
wings/You can fly from things/
Run before the wind/ Lord let it
blow/Let it rock me slow/While I
sleep below/Dreaming dreams/
That only sailors know.”

After years in a self-imposed
exile, Steve Wariner has returned.
If your spring break involves noth-
ing but friends, a big truck, and the
great interstates of America (as
mine does), you’ll need this al-
bum. If, Heaven forbid, you be-
come stranded at mile marker 168
on East 16 and question your ac-
tions, you’ll need the reassurance.

Sweet Honey: 20 years of African- American - goehel

By Scott McLean

Students and faculty got areal
treat this past Thursday with a visit
from at least one member of the
internationally renowned gospel
group Sweet Honey in the Rock,
which was in town for a perfor-
mance at Queens College. Sweet
Honey, an all-female a cappella
ensemble, is currently on a tour of
the country in celebration of their
20th anniversary of performance.

A tour isn’t the only thing
these womenare doing tocelebrate
their 20th year as a group: they are
releasing an anniversary album
entitled Still on the Journeyas well
as a book of reminiscences by such
celebrities as Angela Davis and
Alice Walker on the impact the
group has had on African-Ameri-
can culture in the U.S.

Although the groupis celebrat-
ing 20 years, the current lineup has
only been together since the mid-
80’s. Over the years at least 21
women have come and gone
through Sweet Honey’s doors, but
at the nucleus of it all has been the
group’s founder, Bernice Johnson
Reagon. Reagon has gaineda good
deal of fame in her own right as a

Sweet Honey performs at Davidson.

Smithsonian Institute, and as the
subject of the Emmy-nominated
1992 Bill Moyers documentary,
The Songs are Free , in which she
describes the role of Sweet Honey

in the Rock as a “transmitter of
African-American culture.”
Mixing traditional African-
American tunes with their unique
style of presentation flavored by
African, American, and Caribbean

cultures, Sweet Honey goes be-
yond Reagon's classification as
“transmitter;” these women are a
vibrant reservoir of African-Ameri-
can heritage, exhibiting a culture
that continues to evolve and grow.

The characters in Buried Child
used to be aperfectly normal, “well
established” family. Mom and dad
were doing well with the farm; the
kids were all grown up and out of
the house; there were even
grandkids on the way. . . sort of.
That’s went something went terri-
bly wrong.

Sam Shepard’s Pulitzer-Prize-
winning play opens several years
after the mysterious incidents
which turned this average Ameri-

can household into aself-contained ~

‘seem to be a little off-center — if
not just plain crazy. Vince (Derek
Judson), the grandson, has just
showed up at the house for a visit
after a six-year absence, andit’s up
to him and his girlfriend Shelly
(Ashley Wright) to make some
sense out of the family and their
strange behavior.

sight”—from “Shadows and
Light”) feature some of the best
singing ever in a pop song.

The Beatles—Revolver. The
most impressive thing about Re-
volver is its ability to hold dispar-
ate songs together within the con-
fines of an album. Even a cursory
glance hints at how wild a mix
Revolver is. “Eleanor Rigby,” a
haunting tale of the death of a
lonely seamstress, pulses from be-
ginning to end with nothing more
than Paul McCartney’s voice anda
string octet. The drug mantra “To-
morrow Never Knows” mesmer-
izes with drums, bass, a distorted
voice, and layer upon layer of back-
wards guitar tracks. “Yellow Sub-
marine,” the best-known song on

the album, features acoustic gui-
tar, bass drum, and an array of
sound effects over which Ringo
Starr and Company chant, “We all
live in a yellow submarine!”

Contrast this piece with the
next song, the highly philosophi-
cal “She Said She Said,” in which
John Lennon laments, “She said, ‘I
know what it’s like to be dead/I
know what it is to be sad/And
you’re making me feel like I’ve
never been born.”” From yellow
submarines to death—that isajump
only the Beatles could get away
with. Still itis hard to explain why
Revolver is such a good album, one
most critics put above even Sgt.
Pepper’s as their best. The best
way to explain it is that the grab
bag of songs all have just one thing
in common: brilliance.

lavitt to speak this week

avid R. Slavitt, an eminent poet,
ovelist, translator, classicist and
itic will be at Davidson on March
and 4.
He will give a reading in the
orrison Room of the Union at
:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 3
And will run a poetry workshop on
Friday, March 4 in Chambers 309
from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Stu-

_tion, and translations of Ovid

dents interested in attending the
workshop should contact Dr
Stephen Sandy at ext. 2442.
Slavitt-is the author of ed
fifty books, including a dozen vol
umes of poetry, 27 works of fic

of English and Classics at U. Pen

Virgil, and Seneca. He is Lecture

pickup truck of a man,” says direc-
tor Joe Gardner. As the crabbiest
and oldest member of the family,
Dodge seems to hold at least some
of the clues to the family’s past,
but so does his eccentric wife Halie
(Jennifer Neale). The problem is,
which one (ifeither) can be trusted?
And why has their eldestson Tilden
(Scott Lenhart) suddenly moved
back in? And what about his
brother Bradley (Frank Jernigan)
with the prosthetic leg?

Shepard, one of America’s
foremost playwrights and an ac-
complished actor (The Right Stuff,
Thunderheart), seems to have
loaded the play with lots of inten-
tional ambiguities which only in-
tensify the mystery of the buried
child, Rather than putting forth his
own answers, Shepard seems to be
more interested in raising ques-
tions andmaking the audience think

— and laugh. Gardner describes
the play as a “dark comedy” guar-
anteed to produce laughter, “a ner-
vous laughter maybe, but... . that’s
the kind of experience I think that
it adds up to.”

“[The play] is loaded with rich
ideas about what a family is, who
we are as individuals and to what
extent our identity is a part of the
family,” he says. “I think it has a
lot to do with the cliches or expec-
tations we have of so-called nor-
mal American life, and [the play]
exposes the fact that it’s not al-
ways that perfect and idyllic —
and yet it’s worth living. And
that’s where the positive part of it
comes in, in the comedy.”

Gardner says it is “an experi-
ence that will affect not only the
intellect and the emotions, but the
gut.” The show is in Hodson Hall,
March 3-5 and 10-12, at 8 p.m.
