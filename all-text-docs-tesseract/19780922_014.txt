_ . Bonehead has been taking it
easy these last few weeks due to

the fact that he is only ‘regi-
stered in one course. The ceil-
ings were met in all the other
courses, so he just decided to

devote all his time to a seminar

in Indian music.
Rumors have it that _Bone-

Bacardi with the beautiful
babes of Biscayne Bay. Be

SAE’s 239650, and King Tut
has the freshman 40042700.

If we failed to mention your
alpha number it was only
because we didn’t think that
anyone would recognize it.

In keeping with a tradition
that was started this year,

Bernie and Bone are proud to .

present the top named teams of
the 1978 season.
., We are really glad that these
guys chose such distinguished
names because we predict that
their teams are no good; but,.

team has the potential to come ~- Oh, wei get it.

Sixty-niners. Hard team to
figure out because their players
keep changing offensive posi-
tions.: Probably .500 at. best,
but may turn things around by
the end of the season and
possibly go all the way.

Second Watts. It becomes
apparent that Davidson has
such intelligent students ahd
original thinkers just by consi-

- dering the name that the guys

on K-C. and J.J.’s hall have
picked. We.will admit that this
name has not been used in
recent, years and congratula-
tions to the idiot who thought of

it.

Now to the season.

The KA’s proved once again
that McFleet’ cannot win in a
non-regular season game by
knocking the stuff out of them
24-6 last Wednesday. The game
was played for the benefit of the
freshmints and we are sure that
both of the freshmen there
learned a lot from it.

David ‘‘The Human Speed
Maggot”’ Smith had ‘these com-
ments after tagging J. Stroud
for a safety: ‘It was the
quickést that I have ever been.
I must have registered 10
disciples on the boltmeter.”’

That awesome group of
SAE’s embarrassed the SPE
team of Big Boa and the
T-Snakes in another ‘‘prep'’
game Of the season. We will not

_ mention. the score, but it was,
* 56-0. The E’s scored eight times’

on the first eight plays from

‘game Jim Richards

was ‘ecstatic. ‘‘I feel like

. we have busted through the

stratosphere and into the blow-
zone,” he said. Right on, Jim.
Monday marked the begin-

“ning of the regular season.

Nothing spectacular happened

- except that a number of fresh-

men teams were taught not to
mess with the big boys.

KA Gold beat Capt. Cohab
46-0, Up and Coming over the
Cadillac Cowboys 63-13, PIKA
downed Second Watts 14-7, The
Hole corked the 69’s 18-7, and
TBA. pushed past the Tuts
17-6.

In other action this week the
Old Men hobbled over First
Richardson 44-10. Go Shane!
‘The. Drawbacks did not get out
in time and lost 36-6 to the Four
Skins, Florida State over Okla-
homa State 38-20. ~
