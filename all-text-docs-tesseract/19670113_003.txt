DAVIDSON'S BIG WIN over West Virginia Saturday
night proved that the ‘Cats are capable of beating any
team on a given night. That's what sports writers say
about teams that they can’t figure out and don’t want to
go out on a limb with predictions, but the phrase also ap-
plies to this team because when you get down to speci-
fics, we can win when someone is hot enough to carry
the team for a period.

Saturday night a rejuvenated Tom Youngdale kept
our chances alive while Wayne Huckel unwound. Then in
the second half Mike O’Neill, who is the best shot on the
team when he’s hot, teamed with Rod Knowles, who is
gradually beginning to play the ball we must have from
his to win, to pull it out of the fire.

Another major difference between the holiday dis-
aster and Saturday’s game was the number of turnovers.
A team is killing its chances to win when it loses the ball
over 20 times on violations and steals. We gave the ball
away only 12 times, a considerable reduction, but still
not enough to make us a consistently winning team.

With their next three games, against Tech tonight.
and Wake Forest and West Virginia, both of whom will
be seeking revenge, winning is going to be difficult.
After that, rebuilding St. Joseph’s and Richmond invade
followed by a trip to Milwaukee to meet Marquette. Add
to that a tilt with Warren Mitchell’s strong Indians from
William and Mary, and you can see that pressure is going
to be a continuing factor for the remainder of the sea-

son.

WILDCAT NOTES: The Southern Conference cage
champion meets a member-at-large school March. 11 in
the first round of the NCAA playoffs. Best bets for the
at-large berths are Duke-killer Virginia Tech and
Providence, who features that “other guy” from Laurin-
burg, Jimmy Walker, called by Princeton coach Bill van

Breda Kolff better than Bill Bradley. Winner of that
game meets the Atlantic Coast Conference champion at

College Park, Md.. March 17.

A change in Southern Conference rules in Decem-
ber has given the choice of accepting at NIT bid to the
school invited instead replacing the conference ban on
participation in the New York fiasco.

SEEING THE LIGHT

DR. TOM SCOTT is to be congratulated for seeing

the student viewpoint on Coliseum date ticket prices. A
major order of thanks goes to the Student Council which
carried the ball. Bringing the ticket prices to half price
gives a sense of uniformity to date ticket policy since

every other athletic event we charge admission to offers

a reduced-rate date ticket.
THE MAIN PROBLEM now facing students is how to
keep the ushers out of their hair. The trouble is caused

by a few people (students impressing dates, parents. facul-

ty families, etc.) who want to sit in their own seats. The
rest of us, having tasted the sweets of first-come-
first-served seating last year, aren't anxious to give it up.
One of the best ways to alleviate some of the confusion
is to tell those ushers who are the epitome of efficiency
that you have already found your seat. By avoiding their
services, we can make the student sections just that with
less interference.

GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY’S decision to
drop football was one in the making for over two years.
Faced with competition from the Washington Redskins
and having to play their games in huge D. C. Stadium
where the rent matched the empty seats, the urban school
reached the point where football was a sport which was
largely forgotten by all but loyal GW fans (of which there
were few. Their 1965 homecoming game with Davidson
was attended by about 6,000 fans and Dean Rusk.)

What GW's withdrawal will do to Southern Confer-
ence football is complex. A likely outcome is that a couple
of schools will not have enough games to qualify for the
conference title without special provisions. Most likely
victims will be West Virginia and William and Mary,
schools which are becoming increasingly football-mind-
ed with their big games against Eastern independents.

Davidson was scheduled to meet the Colonials in the
opening game of the 1968 season. Probable replacement
with be Presbyterian College whose contract runs out
after this fall.

THE LOST OF GW will weaken the conference in
football because the schoal has traditionally been strong.
They had teamed with West Virginia, William and Mary
and newcomer East Carolina to dominate the standings in
the Southern Conference. Another longe-range conse-
quence of GW's quitting football may be the acclerated
date of withdrawal of West Virginia from the conference
because of greater aspirations.

NOTES TO THOSE WHO TO KNOW: Claude Finney
“was Davidson’s first All-Amerian, not Fred Hetzel. The
greatest soccer player in Wildcat history beat Hetzel by
one year, in 1963. .

Alabama doesn’t have any seniors on their basket-
ball team either and they are doing about like us. Two
differences: they haven't won a Southeastern Conference
game yet and haven't lost but a couple of games against
outsiders. The other difference is that no one cares about
basketball down there anyway. ;

The basketball press brochure compiled by the
Sports Information office is a great improvement over
past issues. Similar to the program, it contains the now-
infamous cliches such as “If you like class basketball
players, you'll love ....." and the Lefty Driesell story,
that touch and go story of the trials and tribulations of
our leader. It also includes a page from last year’s book
which lists seven home games in Johnston Gym and Ken
Blair as a football coach.

Coach Tom Stevens was not
optimistic on his team's chances
during the trip. He said it -is
possible that only six swimmers
will make the trip. Eddie Beach,
a valuable team member. is in
the infirmary and Joe Friebele
and Tucker Dalton. the team's
best diver, are also uncertain as
to whether they will be able to
go.

Stevens commented. ‘We will
do the best we can with what we
have."’ He -reported that the
meet with Roanoke should be a
very good one, but that Virginia
just had too many good swim-
mers for Davidson to compete
against them effectively. There
should be some good individual
races in both meets as the ‘Cats
have some strong individual
