Memories Return With Class Of ’22

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

Memories of four years spent
at Davidson; memories both
pleasamt and painful, will come
crowding into the minds of the
Class of '22 as they return to
Davidson for their 50th Year
Reunion this weekend.

The Class of ‘22, along with
some other classes, will be hon-
ored this weekend during the
festivities of Alumni Weekend.

The members of the Class of
‘22 will think back to 1918 and
their arrival at Davidson as
freshmen. They will remember
the Jaybird Special, the train
that brought them to Davidson.

They will recall carrying their
luggage to their dorms along
with the other 127 members of
the class. No doubt they won-
dered at the time which dorm
they would be in. Would it be
Georgia, Rumple, Watts. or
Chambers?

That's right. Old Chambers
was used fa: more than classes
then. Besides the five class-
rooms that it contained, Cham
bers also housed three labora-
tories und 72 sleeping rooms.

Heating was provided by eith-
er a fireplace or a coal burn-
ing stove. Coal was also used
in the fireplaces; the coal was
provided by the college.

As a student, you only had to
carry the coal from the coal
pile to your room. Staying warm
took a little effort then.

Most of the men in the classes
at Davidson in 1918 were mem-
bers of the Student Army Train-
ing Corps, or SATC.

A regular branc® cf the army,
SATC requized the wearing of
uniform. The hat worn by the
students had a special cord on
it that looked like the cord on
an. officer's hat.

Many students in the fresh-
mam class had come to David-
son just to join SATC. After it
was disbanded in 1918 (the stu-
dents were discharged during
the Christmas holidays) several
students, especially members of

the freshman class, did not re-
turn to Davidson.

Probably the best remembered
event that occurred during the
four years that the Class of ’22
was at Davidson was the burn-
ing down of Old Chambers éarly
on the morning of Nov. 28, 1921.

While the blackened remains
of Chambers were being clean-
ed up, an interesting rumor was
circulated on campus. It con-
cerned the pillars that were in
front of Chambers. The pillars
were hollow and open at the top.

The rumor said that a human
skeleton was found in the ‘bot-
tom of ane of the pillars. As far
as can be discovered now, the
rumor was never proven.

One of the early issues of the
DAVIDSONIAN for the year
1921-1922 contained ati article on
the lib:ary hours. The article
said that due to requests from
students for longer tours, the
library would now stay open
from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. These
extra hours meant that the li-
brary was row open for a grand
total of seven and cne half hours
per day.

The library hous were from
10 a.m. to 12 noon, from 2:30 to
6 p.m. The article also contain-
ed a statement to the effect that

if the students did not use the
library during these new hours,
they would be done away with.

Fines for overdue books were
listed in the article. An overdue
reserve book would cost you 25
cents per day, while an ordinary
book that was overdue cost the
student only a nickel a day.

Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?
The Class of '22 saw Henrik
Ibsen’s ‘‘Ghosts”on March 14,
1922. There was quite a differ-
ance between the production put
on at Davidson this January and
the one seen by the students 50
years ago. The 1922 production
was far from being a student

affair, its stars were two prom-
inent Norwegian actors.

According to. the DAVIDSON-
IAN, “Madame Borgny Ham-
mer, the well-known Norwegian
actress,” portrayed Mrs. Alving
and did an excellent job. The
sets were built by a company
in Chicago.

Old Heroes Face Young Cats

By JOE EARLE

Tomorrow afternoon two very
different football teams will
clash on Richardson Field in
the annual alumni-varsity game.

The alumni team is a strange
conglomerate of past Davidson
stars and present students.

The alumni have fielded quite
an impressive roster, and will
put many of Davidson’s record-
holders and past grid heroes on
the field.

The Cats have only eight or
nine returning seniors this year,
and only a few more juniors,
and so the team is inexperienc-

ed and lacks depth.

“We're a little bit skinny,”
Dave Fagg, head coach of the
Davidson gridders, commented,
‘but the team is reasonably
tough and has great spirit.”

The alumni team will be what
Sandy Carnegie Sr., head of the
Wildcat Club and coach of the
alumni team, called ‘‘a collec-
tion of lawyers, doctors, busi‘
mnessmen and coaches.”

One of the coaches that will
go on the field tomorrow is Da-
vidscn Cage Coach Terry Hol-
land.

Holland will suit out for one
end position. This will be Hol-
lanfl’s first football game since
his high school days.

The other end spot will be
fillled by Steve Heckard, past
head of the Wildcat Club and
last year’s alumni game organ-
izer.

A third player in the end-slot
back category will be Jim Pink-
ney, certainly the oldest foot-
ball player at Davidson.

“Jim played on the '26 David-
son team, the state champions,”
Carnegie said. ‘‘To do that they
beat Duke, North Carolina and
N. C. State.”

These ends will be well served
in the alumni’s passing offense,
for two of Davidson's greatest
passing quarterbacks will steer
the alumni offense.

Gordon Slade, the quarterback
that directed the Cats to the
Tangerine Bowl, will start in
that position. Stade holds the
school records in total offense,
and almost any passing record
there is.

Slade will be backed up by
Jimmy Poole, the man who pre-
ceded him as quarterback for
the Cats. Poole was Southern
Conference co-player of the year
im 1968.

Although Carnegie predicted
that his team may be weak on

defense, he will have the ser-
vices of Jack Wade to fall back
on.

Wade holds the school marks
for most intercepted passes, and
turned an interception into a

96-yd. touchdown to upset N. C.
State in 1950.

The varsity will offer a few
changes in the game, but ac-
cording to Fagg, no major sur-

prises can be expected.

‘‘We’ve changed to a ‘60’ de-
fense,” he said, ‘‘with six line-
men. On offense we’re using
split backs. We’ll throw some
and run the inside and outside
veer.

“‘We’re still very small for an
inter-collegiate football team,”
he said, “‘but this year I feel
we’re quicker.”
