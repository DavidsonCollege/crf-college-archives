Men's Tennis
Finishes Strong

By ROBERT GRUBB

The men’s tennis team ended
their season with an impressive
performance over the weekend at
the HamptonInn Classic. Davidson
hosted the Citadel, Furman and
UNCC during the second annual
season-ending tournament.

Davidsondefeated the Citadel
10-2 on Friday, sweeping all 8
singles matches. On Saturday, the
Wildcats came back with another
fine performance, but were de-
feated by Furman, the regular sea-
son champs of the Southern Con-
ference. Coach Jeff Frank was
happy with the performance of his
squad. “On Friday, we played as

well as we have all year, top to
bottom,” said Frank. “Even though
we lost on Saturday, most of the
matches were evenly played and
went to three sets or to tiebreak-
ers.”

Because of the one-sidedness
of the matches on Friday and Sat-
urday, the four teams played a
random schedule of matches on
Sunday.

The ‘Cats finished the last two
weeks of theseason strongly; wins
over Belmont Abbey, Pfeiffer and
Queens set their final record at 14-
13. Said Frank of his 18th consecu-
tive winning season, “We played
some of our best tennis at the end
of the year. | feel like we ended our
season On a positive note.”

Rugby Triumphs in
Steinlager Tournament

By TIM HARRIS

The Davidson Rugby team is
back on its feet again after falling
apart early in 1988. The club team
has had a difficult schedule for its
first year, but has made its pres-
ence felt as a future rugby force in
North Carolina. UNCC, Duke and

ECU proved to be tall orders for
the young Wildcats, who returned
just seven players. But much new
enthusiastism added tothe experi-
ence and enabled the team to offer

a challenging game to any oppo-
nent. In addition, Dr. David Cop-

Track Ends Season With
Excellent Performance

By JAY CLUGSTON

The men’s and women’s track
teams ended their seasons with
exciting performances and _per-
sonal records at the April 13-14
Duke Invitational, and the April
20-21 Furman Invitational.

At Duke, the men produced
seven personal bests in ten per-
formances. “It was there,” said
senior David Murray, referring to
the preparedness of his legs after a
twoweek tapering off period in the
distance crew’s training. “Coach
Andrew had us ready.” Murray
lowered his 10,000 meter personal
best time by 54 seconds to 31:41.0,
and in the process became
Davidson’s number two‘all-time
fastest 10K performer. —

Moving into the number three
spot in the same category during

thesamerace was sophomoreChris:

Otrok with a time of 32:16.2. He
was followed by freshman David
Kerns in 33:10. The guys went out
so hard in this race that Murray
was below his best times at the
3200, 5000, and 8000 meter splits
(9:59, 15:41, and 25:20). Freshman
Ian Stewart ran the team’s fastest
5,000 meters for theseason(15:40.4),
removing 22 seconds from his
previous best. Freshman Peter

Hurtado and senior Jay Clugston:

combined for a strong 1,500 meter
showing with times of 4:03.7 and
4:05.4, and freshman Ben Wiley
lowered his800 meter timeby over
2.5 seconds to 2:00.8. Wiley will

surely break 2 minutes next year.

The Furman meet meant a

“change of race” for most of the
guysas they ranraces they had not
specifically trained for. lan Stewart
began the changes with his first
ever 3,000 meter steeplechase.
Despite minimal experience going
over barriers, Stewartrana 10:29.8,
and then the next day came back to
run his personal best time in the
1500 meter (4:13.4). Peter Hurtado
and Chris Otrok placed first and
second in the 2 mile with times of
9:45.4, and 9:48.2. With this per-
formance, Hurtado became the
season leader in four events forthe
Wildcats (1600 m relay split 52.3,
800m 1:58.05, 1500m 4:03.7, 2 mile
9:45.4). “He may be short, but those
Italian legs of his can really turn
over. Pete has had a sensational
freshman season,” said Coach
Andrew. Both Hurtadoand Otrok
came back on Saturday to run
strong races again. Otrok won the
5,000 (15:53.1), and Hurtadoplaced
2nd in the 800 meters, running a
1:59.8 with a negative split (faster
last 400 meter than first) of 59 sec-
onds. Also in the 800 meter, Jay
Clugston placed 4th with a per-
sonal best time of 2:01.6. Senior
Robby “Sage” McKay moved up
from the 1500 meters torun his first
5000 meters in 17:18. The 1600 meter
relay team of freshman DanFranks,
Wiley, Hurtado, and Clugston

<losedout the year with its sea-

sonal best 4:38.49.

Sophomore Kathy Beach con-
tinued her record breaking ways
for the women’s team at the Duke
Invitational. Beach lowered her
ownschool 3,000 meter record from
10:23 to 10:10.06. Freshman Jen-

,

nifer Brownrana 2:24.2 800 meters
which lowered her previous best
time by more than 2 seconds, and
freshman Heather Tarpley contin-
ued to display versatility, contrib-
uting strong performances in the
100 and 400 meter hurdles (16.91,
69.02), and 400 meters (62.6). Atthe
Duke meet, assistant coach and
1989 NCAA Division I All Ameri-
can Beth Manson showcased her
discus throwing abilities, winning
the competition with a throw of
148’3". Coach Manson also placéd
fourth in the shot with a put of 44’2

3/4". Her strong performances

followed just minimal practice
since last June.

The next week, Manson en-
joyed coaching all of her throwers
to personal bests at the Furman
Invitational. Jenny White threw the
javelin’77’5” for 5th place. Deidra
Montagueand Susan Swift put the
shot 26‘S"\and 33/10.5" (3rd place),
respectively, and Heather Tarpley
threw the discus 111’8” for 4th
place. Tarpley also placed 2nd in
the 100 meter hurdles (16.4) and
2nd in the 400 meter hurdles (70,3).
Kathy Beach won'the 1500 meters
easily in 4:53.4,and combined with
Jennifer Brown to place Davidson
Ist and 2nd in the 800 meters.
Beach’s 800 meter time of 2:23.8 is
her personal best, and Brownrana
2:24.5, just slightly over her best
time.

The Wildcats lose only three
men and two women to gradu-
ation and plan to better this year’s
strong showing next spring. Stay
tuned for cross country this com-
ming fall.

Mooresville Native Recipient of
First Women's Athletic Scholarship

Davidson’s basketball future
grew brighter in thelastfew weeks
when coach Bob McKillop signed
two highly-regarded players to
national letters of intent. Point
guard Pat Holloway comes to
Davidson from George Washing-
ton H.S. in Denver, Colorado. He
averaged 23.1 points, 6.0assistsand
4.8 rebounds during his senior
campaign, prompting the Denver
Post toname him toits All-Cityand
All-State first teams. Said McKil-
lop, “Pat brings a variety of abili-
ties to our program. He’s an excel-
lent ballhandler who can be crea-
tive. He can shoot the three-point
shot, too. Patis capable of drawing
fouls and is an excellent foul
shooter.”

Forward Scott Alford played
his senior season at Maine Central

_Institute in Pittsfield, Maine. His

statistics (11 ppg, 6rpg, 4apg) seem
unimpressive until one takes into

account that his team compiled a
24-0 record and distributed nine
players to Division I colleges. He
also shot 52 percent from the floor
and 87 percent from the free-throw
line. McKillop calls Alford a “jack
of all trades. He handles the ball
well and is an outstanding passer.
Healsoshoots withrange. Because
of his skills and size, Scott has
excellent versatility.”

This year’s Wildcatsquad loses
five seniors to graduation, includ-
ing point guard and MVP Alan
Hunter, soa youth movementis in
effect, led by rising sophomores
Detlef Musch and J.D. Heuer.
McKillop hopes to signatleast three
more players, and has combed the

nation’s high schools and junior

colleges in search of players ca-
pableof contributing immediately,

Meanwhile, Mooresville’s own
JenniferSatterfield etched hername
into the annals of Davidson athlet-

ics when she signed an athletic
grant-in-aid to play women’s soc-
cer, thereby becoming the recipi-
ent of Davidson's first women’s
athletic scholarship. Satterfield
served as co-captain of the boys’
soccer team at Mooresville High,
which won the Class AA North
Carolina state championship with
a17-2-2record. Satterfield has three
times been chosen tothe U.S. Youth
Soccer Association Region III
player pool, and was named an
honorable mention all-conference
selection her senior season. Coach
Diane Boettcher feels that “Jennifer
will contribute immediately with
strong technical ability and per-
ceptiveplay.” The women’s soccer
team turned ina respectable 4-7-1
ledgerin its initial campaigna year
