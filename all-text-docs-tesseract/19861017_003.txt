Frost’s poems, including “The
Road Not Taken,” “Nothing Gold
Can Stay,” “Mending Wall,”
“Fire and Ice,” “The Witch,”
“Stopping By the Woods on a
Snowy Evening” (in which he im-
itated the voice and style of frost)
and “After Apple-Picking.”

He interspersed between the

fortable atmosphere suggested by
the title of the program. His ap-

Julio Ramirez

A new addition to the psychol-
ogy department faculty, Julio
Ramirez, Ph.D., comes to David-
son College from a teaching ap-
pointment at St. John’s Univer-
sity/University of St. Benedict.

_ Although he is barely moved
into his office in the basement of
Chambers, Ramirez has already
made an important accomplish-
ment at Davidson.

Brain Research, a premier
journal of neuroscience, accord-
ing to Ramirez, recently accepted
an article prepared by him dealing
with his research on the drug
gangliosicle and its positive -ef-
<—fects on brain-damaged rats.

As a teacher of general psy-
chology and physiological psy-
chology, Ramirez siad he enjoys

When not in the classroom or
laboratory, Ramirez may be found
in Johnston Gymnasium swim-

volved the audience in what was
more like an intimate after-dinner
chat about an old friend than a per-
formance of literary works by a
Pulitzer prize-winning poet.
Brower’s background is in
theater; he began his acting career
in New York in 1946, and planned
to be an actor and director all his
life. However, in 1953 he and his
wife decided to leave New York,
and he began teaching at Prince-
ton Theological Seminary, satis-
fying his desire to work in drama

by occasionally directing at, the-

university theater and by doing
summer stock. In 1972 he con-
ceived the idea of creating an eve-
ning of Frost’s poetry.

“Frost was the poet who most
appealed to me,” he sajd, “for a
variety of reasons. eh a very

conversational style. He’s easily

ming his daily 2000 yards.

Ramirez completed his B.S.
in biopsychotogy at Fairfield Uni-
versity, his M.A. and Ph.D. in
biopsychology at Clark Univer-
sity and post-doctoral students at
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology.

During his short stay at David-
son, Professor L. B. McHenry of

the philosophy department has
found the students to be energetic.

“I appreciate their-enthusiasm
for the subject,” he said. “They’re
vigorous and bright by compari-
son with ‘students in some of the
universities I’ve taught in.”

McHenry has taught at the
University of Edinburgh in Scot-
land and at Old Dominion in Nor-

Economics, and got his Ph.D. at
the University of Edinburgh be-
cause “the type of philosophy I

accessible to any intelligent-per-
son, you don’t need a code
machine to figure him out. On the
other hand, he is also deep. I

think, ideally, that’s the combina- —

tion poetry should have: to be
clear enough, but deep.” <
“I’m very happy with what
I’m doing. I started out star-
struck, like a lot of young kids,
wanting to get a name for myself,
be famous. But now I have two lit-

tle grandkids, and being on stage —

with Frost is all I need. I go to col-
-feges, universities, clubs, church
groups, all over the place. I’ve
gone on the road to Hawaii, three
times to California (Frost was
born there, you know), to Texas,

and everywhere in between. I fig- _

ure I’ve performed about 125

times so far. I really do enjoy it —

very much.”

William Brower reads Frost

ing on a book titled Experience °

and Reality. Also, he is helping
Professor Victor Lowe write the
second volume of Alfred North
Whitehead’s intellectual biog-
raphy. McHenry plans to include
Whitehead in his American phi-
losophy class spring term.

“I’m aslo interest in art,”
McHenry adds, “I did my under-
graduate degfee in painting. I
draw and paint whenever I can
find the time. And I quite like
water sports, too.”

Dr. William Pollans
Dr. William Pollans joined the
physics faculty this year as a visi-

earned a B.S. and M.S. from Uni-
versity of Chicago and his Ph.D..
from University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill.

Pollans’ published work in-
cludes research in soil physics,
which he describes as “the study
of waterflow ~ through’ soils.”
Otherwise, pollans — described
himself as “a teacher, not a re-
searcher.”

Pollans’ graying hair and
wire-rimmed glasses give him a
distinct resemblance to the father
of modern physics, Albert Eins-
tein, whose photograph hangs on
Pollans’ office door.

Outside of the classroom, Pol-
lans_ enjoys “playing with my
Commodore 64 computer,” and
when at home, tending to his
horses and ponies.

Having completed all his col-
lege work in physics, Pollans

~ Ronald Parris, Ph.D., anative
of Barbados, West Indies, joined

the Davidson Sociology depart- -
ment faculty this year after a
seven-year leave from education.

val, Parris worked as a Program
Specialist with UNESCO in Paris,

France. In charge of development
of programs in*Third World na-

tions, Parris traveled around the
world in the position.
Parris returned to education

simply because he “missed teach-

ing students.” |

A fan of jazz, calypso, and
short-wave radio, Parris also en-
joys writing. His publications in-
clude seven magazine articles and
three books written in three lan-
guages.

Parris, who_ believes the
Davidson College. trimester sys=

‘tem to be “murderous,” said he is

“impressed by the conscientious-
ness of Davidson students.”

Parris earned his B.A. in .
sociology and anthropology from

the University-of Rochester, his —

M.A. in sociology from the Uni-

‘ versity of California, Santa Bar-

bara, and his Ph.D. in sociology
