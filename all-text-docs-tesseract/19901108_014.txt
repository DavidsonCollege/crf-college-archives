Cats Take Deep South Title

By LARRY DAGENHART

Five years of hard work finally
paid off for coach Betsy Pryor and
the Davidson field hockey team
when it took care of Pfeiffer Col-
lege and beat Wake Forest Univer-
sity twice (by scores of 1-0 and 5-
1) tocapture the Deep South Tour-
nament championship for the first
time ever. The tournament win was
certainly not the team’s only rec-
ord-setting performance. Davidson
finished its season with its finest
record to date (14-1-2), scored more
goals than it ever had before (52),
and sent 11 players to all-Deep
South tournamentteams which will
compete this weekend at the South-
east Regional.

The Wildcats went into the
tournamenta deserved number one
seed after defeating each team in
the Deep South division over the
course of the regular season. After
afirstround bye, the Cats advanced
to the second round to face Pfeif-
fer. The “Cats overcame jitters at
the outset, and managed to get first
half goals from Gigi Cooke and
Simone Plaisance. The second half
saw Davidson totally dominate;
scores from Jennifer Roos and
Lauren Follmer spurred the Wild-
cats to.a4-0 victory...

Saturday’s semifinal match
against Wake Forest was a gameof

momentum shifts, and it seemed
that whoever had that momentum
at the end would win. According
to coach Pryor, the game was
played “inside the 25's.” “We (also)
didn’t play our game,” added the
coach. “We didn’t go to the ball
and looked tired.” Statistically the
match was one of the “Cats closer
ones as they were outshot on goal
14-17. Still, it was impressive to
beat an ACC team with a subpar
performance.
Because the Deep South Tour-
nament is a double-elimination
affair, the Wildcats were forced to
play Wake Forest again for the
championship, and the second go-
round wasnoteven close. Davidson
put the game away early by taking
a 3-0 halftime lead with scores
from Monique Dockter, Simone
Plaisance and Jenny Plowright.
By the middle of the second
half, with the score 3-1, the Dea-
cons had re-gained some momen-
tum and made things a little tense.
But Erin Lang puta nail in Wake’s
coffin by scooping up the ball and
thrusting it just under the crossbar
and over the goalie’s head, a shot
virtually impossible to save. Ten
minutes later, Jacquline Ukrop
decided the final outcome by scor-
ing uncontested to make it 5-1.
“Wake didn’t play its usual

aggressive game and looked flat,”
commented coach Pryor. “We
forced them into it because we
were in control of the game,” she
added. Credit is also due the team
for coming together in close situ-
ations, as well as overcoming the
injuries of Suzanne Hardesty and
Gigi Cooke, both of whom went
out midway. through the champi-
‘onship game.

Coach Pryor commended the
entire team, whether on the field or
on the bench, for the “total team
effort”; it was everyone’s utmost
positive attitude that helped them
achieve this succcess.

NOTES: Deep South Tourna-
ment first team selections were:
Mary Russ, Beth Pharr, Simone
Plaisance, Suzanne Hardesty and
Emily Coleman. Players compos-
ing the second team: Francesca
Fiero, Jennifer Roos, Jenny Plow-
right, Moinique Dockter, Erin
Lang. The Deep South third team
included Lauren Follmer. These
players will play on their respec-
tive all-star teams in the Southeast
Tournament at Catawba College
in Salisbury. From there, players
can be selected to compete in the
National Hockey Festival which
takes place in Coco, Fla. over
Thanksgiving.

NCAA Slights Wildcat Soccer

By ALAN ROSSELOT

The men’s soccer team came
up short of fulfilling hopes for a
conferencechampionship in its first
year in the Big South Monday af-
ternoon, falling 2- 0 to Coastal
Carolina.

Afterrolling over Campbell 5-
2 in the semifinals Saturday, the
Wildcats came in flying high ag-
inst Coastal, the two-time defend-
ing champs. Unfortunately, the
‘Cats could not cap their excellent
season eith a win.

The loss brought to an end an
excellent season during which the
Wildcats were ranked in the na-
tional Top 20. In the final regular-
season poll, Davidson received
votes for the Top 20; they were the

‘only team to do so that did not
receive a berth in the 28 team
NCAA Tournament. The ‘Cats
finished ranked 5th in the South,
and defeated South Carolina and
Richmond, both of which received
Tournament bids. e

Much of their success can be

attributed to the veteran play of -

seniors Ross Saldarini, Peter Cobb
and Scott Zucker. As junior Rob
Ukrop put it, these three players

New Team Shatters
Old Records

By BRUCE BALESTIER

The Wildcats’ three-game
triumph over Augusta two weeks
ago created a pair of new highwa-
ter marks forthe program. The win
was their 14th in a row, breaking
the record of 13 consecutive wins
set by the 1988 team. Their win
total of 27 extended by one the rec-
ord of 26 wins set by the 1988
squad, With two wins: ast. week,
the ‘Cats moved to 29-5; and set a
record for most wins ever by a
Davidson team.

Coach Rebecca Hawkins al-
lowed that “‘it feels great to get the
record,” but expressed concern
about the team’s continued moti-
vation. Her fears were justified

Wildcats’ second loss of the year
to the Spartans.

Hawkins admitted that she
considers UNC-G a “markedly
better” team, but was “bothered by
the fact that we'didn’t play well

Hawkins concerned about the
possibility of burnout. She insists
that her team must-“cut down on
errors” if they hope to come away

Cats Fall To Marathon

By BRUCE BALESTIER

Davidson head coach Bob
McKillop unveiled his youthmove-
ment in Saturday night’s 114-92
setback at the hands of the touring
exhibition team from Marathon Oil.
Starting a quintet featuring a jun-
ior (Paul Denmond), two sopho-
mores (J.D. Heuer and Detlef
Musch) and two freshmen (Pat
Holloway and James Marsh), the
Wildcats turned in an inconsistent
performance in losing to the pow-
erful Oilers.

The *Cats seemed out of sync
offensively throughout mostof the
contest, and simply could not stop
Marathon’s hot shooting collec-
tion of former major college play-

shave the deficit,

Davidson did receive an ex-
cellent contribution from their
much-improved frontcourt. He
contributed15 points and 11 re-
bounds at the big forward spot, and
the 7’0" Musch chipped in with 14
points, Juco transfer Jeff Chapin
threw in 14 points, including two
three-point goals, in a superb stint
off the: bench, and continued to
impress with his deadly outside
shot. :

At the point guard spot, a trio
of players shared time. Freshmen
Holloway and Jason Zimmerman
and junior Paul Denmond (who
spent most of his time at shooting
guard) combined for 26 points and

ers. A 57-42° Marathon lead at
halftime snowballed into a more
than thirty point cushion before
the Wildcats regained conscious-
néss and mounted a late rally to

10 assists. The Wildcats return to
action Saturday night with an
exhibition game at Belk Arena
against the Swedish ‘National
Team,
