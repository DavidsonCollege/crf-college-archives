Communications gap plagues D.C.

By JASON NOBLE
Staff Writer

One of the reasons for attending a
small liberal arts college such as
Davidson, is the opportunity for
establishing close personal ties be-
tween student and faculty. To what
extent does this opportunity exist?
Remarks about fellow students brown
nosing rather than socializing are
frequently heard, and if one attends a
party given by a professor the
dialogue revolves around the profes-
sor’s specialization as much as any
type of normal spontaneous dialogue.
Is there a definite and natural
unsurpassable gulf between students
and professors or are all involved
merely playing pre-programmed
(safe) roles, unwilling to just relax
and comfortably relate to one ano-
ther?* =

Asked.how he feels about relations
to students, Herb Jackson doesn’t
‘see why they should feel inhibited at
all. In most cases (the) inhibitions are
the students.’’ Herb further com-
mented that ‘‘if I go to a lot of student
functions there is an immediate
reaction. People look like I’m inva-
ding or something.”

Professor David C. Grant observed
that ‘‘as long as professors are
required to give labels to students’
performances, there is a unique
relationship.”’ This aside, he “‘would
like to see a more informal degree of
organization’’ within student-faculty
activities.

Several professors expressed a de-
sire to reinstitute a Sunday open
house policy. Professor Charles Lloyd
felt it “added something that we don’t
have now.” Professor Locke White
also said he ‘‘would like to see a
renewal in the tradition or faculty
open houses every Sunday evening”
adding that during his student years
at Davidson “‘it meant a great deal’’
to him.

Some professors, however, felt
otherwise to such a pre-scheduled

activity. Professor Gordon Michael-
son explained that there’s ‘“‘too much
emphasis on planning to be spon-
taneous”’ and that it’s ‘‘unrealistic to
suppose that some great familiarity
will develop. In most cases when it
does it’s spontaneous, natural and
unplanned.”

Professor Nutt also commented in
this vein, stating that relationships
“should be natural, not forced.’’ He
felt that just this type of relaxed
interaction existed with most of his
majors and that there was ‘‘no gulf
between majors” and himself.

Many professors certainly try to
narrow the distinction between them-
selves themselves and their students.
Professor Donald Kimmel has several
social affairs at his house each year
and is ‘‘strongly in tavor of doing any
formal or informal thing that can be
done to break down the social
distinction between student and* fac-
ulty. We’re here for interaction with
the students.”’ :

Professor Kimmel felt the need for
‘‘more organized student teacher
affairs,’’ a point echoed by Professor
Bryan when he says it ‘‘wouldn’t hurt
for some kind of promotion to go on.”’
Professor Bryan sensed that some
‘students are afraid to initiate’ social
ifteraction with their professors.
Considering various activities, Pro-
fessor Bryan felt no uncomfortable-
ness playing squash or tennis with his
students. Professor Michaelson also
didn’t see any reason for not being
able to go fishing or play tennis with
members of the student body.

Perhaps a major reason for any lack
of interaction results from the prob-
lem of time consumption. ‘Professor
Polley explained, both for himself as
well as other professors, the obvious
need to spend time with family,
friends and just by himself. Professor
Michaelson expounded on this, noting
his ‘‘hours out of office are tied up
with my own research.”

rupt opportunities for normal social-
izing between professors and student,

is the whole stigma involved with
brown nosing. This appears to be an
imagined excuse on the students’ part
than any existing truth.

Professor Kimmel stated that
talking with one’s professor ‘‘doesn’t
pick up points.’’ Professor Polley felt
it’s ‘‘fairly easy to detect’’ any grade
grubbing attempts. The only way he
believed socializing could affect
grades was that knowing a student
better, it would be easier to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

What the are the students’ senti-
ments regarding’ their relationships
with their professors?

Terry Butler commented “in gene-
ral, most professors make you feel like
you can come to them anytime.” As
to whether or not students and
professors can operate on an equal
social level, Bill Holladay explained
‘“There’s usually a line which you
don’t go. Where that line stands
varies from student to student and
from professor to professor.”’ Holla-
day did feel that “there is very little
to the ‘God to worm’ feeling.”’

Thomas Niblock expressed that
“it’s very important for students and
professors to be together on an
informal basis,’’ adding that ‘‘there’s
a lot of value in informal contact.”’
Some students, such as Bill Burk-
holder ‘‘would like to see more
programs that would force both
student and teacher into pleasant
extracurricular activities so that they
can get to know each other outside of
an academic frame work.”

The majoritive sentiment is one of
desirousness for more informal
gatherings between student and pro-
fessor. However it would be ridiculous

to feel compelled to form close bonds
between professors and students mer-
ely because of any social situation.
Professor Michaelson doesn’t ‘‘think
professors find their pals in the
student body.’”’ And Professor Lloyd
feels that perhaps society ‘‘overem-
phasizes a kind of hypocritical inti-
macy ‘that’ can be very shallow.”’

The entire issue of student-profes-
sor relationship is only an issue
because of the distinction felt between
the two by each party. It’s question-
able just how natural this separation
actually is.

Brian Jacobs feels ‘“‘professors in
my mind are just people” and perhaps
it’s time both groups realized this.
Herb Jackson best sums this idea up
when he says that those involved
‘spend too much time defining them-
selves as student and faculty and not
just people.”’
