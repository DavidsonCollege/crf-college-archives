so far, but recently there has been

considerable agitation in favor of

a new

system somewWlat similar to

So we have picked as the qnes- |
the week, “What do you |

too much hypocrisy in the system

of the candidate would put more

Bob Garvey, Sophomore:
Personally IT would not like to

Porky Woodward, Sophomore:

risen in past elections. Past leaders
have been

to end evils a-

unsuccessful in doing
away with the ill feelings that arise
during the election periods, but J
think open polities-will remedy this
undesirable condition. Here is my
vote for open politics and better
feclings during elections.
Don Hott, Senior:

“I do not believe the solution of
the Davidson electoral system lies

in ‘open politics.’ The very idea
of non-fraternity vs. fraternity
seems contrary to the spirit of
Davidson. So far there is no ani-

mosity between those two groups:

_1_would certainly
like to see a solution to the prob-
lem be something rather than ‘open

in the past to prohibit these evils,
I see no reason .to quit trying. If
and when our student body is made
to realize the advantage of real
‘no politics’ system, then these com-
bines, cliques, et cetera, will dis-
appear. I would suggest this
a campaign of the ‘Davidsonian’
instead of trying to get ‘open poli-

present system work better?”

as

Bill Shaw, Sophomore:

“General evils connected with our
present system of so-called ‘politics’

were very aptly’ pointed out by
Erle-in his editorial. Although there
are certain evils in his proposed

open-politics, I am inclined to be-
lieve that the new system would
have a much better reception a-
mong the students and would there-
fore be an improvement over the
‘closed’ type. I am heartily in favor
of the open forum because every-
one has a chance to impose his
ideas on all without fear of hear-
ing someone cry combine, etcetera.
This open and above-board method
would show the position taken by
the majority of men. It seems as
though it could be arranged to
have these open meetings preced-
ing or. during election period at
which everyone could have an op-
portunity to ‘say his piece’ and thus
silence the petty hates and secrets
for all time.”
