OMICRON KAPPA DELTA
HOLDS INITIATION

_At a meeting of the Omicron Delta
Kappa Society slast week the following
men were initiated: J. A. Thames, J.
B. Daffin, J. W. Clark and Mr. F. L.
Jackson. Thames was a member of the
old Gryphon order, which was merged
into the Omicron Delta Kappa last
spring, but was absent at the time of
initiation,

Omicron Delta Kappa is a national
honorary fraternity, the local organiza-
‘ion being known as the Delta circle.
It draws its members from men in the
upper classes who have achieved distine-
tion in one or more ot the following
five phases of collegiate activity: Schol-
arship or marked proficiency in one or
more collegiate departments: athletics.
‘oth local and intercollegiate: — social
leadership, including conspicuous service
to the institution; literary societies and
intercollegiate contests; and. publications.
By drawing the leaders of these various
branches together in one. organization.
‘he society strives to uphold and advance
all the best interests of the college and
its activities,

‘The complete membership of the local
circle is as follows: J. R..Woods, J.
L.. Fowle, Andrew Brown, A. P. Saun-
Vers, J. W. Clark, J. B. Daffin, EL. M.
Thomas, J. A. Thames, Mr, F. L. Jack-
on. and Dr. W. J. Martin, Dr. J. M.
McConnell and Dr. M. E. Sentelle.

In these days ot unrest, with the Al-
lies fighting our battles for us while we
prepare to pounce down as a unit upon
our enemies, we wonder what will next
startle us, and see, the so thought) im-
vutabla assumes new attributes; fur-
her, cultivated fields, giving promise of
a bountiful crop, become beehives of ac-
tivity—cantonments. fertilizer factories
hecome ammunition works. Our peace-
loving people have been horrified by the
reported outrages of the German Gov
ernment; and their patriotism, cosnio-
politan patriotism that it is, drives them
to temporarily abandon peace, and en-
ter war whole-heartedly, with the pur
pose of re-establishing, on a firmer, more
righteous basis, the rule of the right over
might.

‘To cite one quite unexpected change:
Davidson College has made military
drill compulsory for the two lower
classes, and has instituted an elective
course in military science for the two
upper classes. No doubt this is a most
insignificant change inthe eve of the
Nation, but it interests those who are
interested in Davidson. College athletics
are topsy-turvey ; Davidson's are also in
the whirl. ‘The former “Red and Black
Machine’ has been destroyed by both
graduation from college and withdrawal
of students to join the Army. What
will the new “machine,” now in’ the
process of construction, be able to do
with its opponents? What will David-
con do in loeal and intercollegiate de-
hating amid the perturbed conditions?
Where are your classmates and friends
that you met on the old campus? What
are they doing? In short. what is the
status of affairs with Davidson and
everything Davidsonian in these days of
history-making unrest?
~ Preparedness has long been a subject
ot discussion. It has been decided that
we must prepare, and fight. This is a
national decision, but it applies locally
as well. Amid the struggles of the na-
tions for existence and the furtherance
of righteousness, some (but few, it
seems) see a local struggle, insignificant
nationally. maybe, but vital to David-
son; and it is a struggle just as carnest,
as sincere, as hard. as noble of purpose,
and as high in aim as that of the Nation,
I refer to the struggle for existence on
the part of THE Davinsonian. Since
its founding four years ago, it has had a
fight for continuance; this year it is fac-

ing and fighting against greater odds.
The student body is reduced; advertis-
ets are wary; costs of production are
high, Alumni subscriptions are lacking.

sent straight home: the life of the six-
page paper hangs in the balance; the
continuance of even a four-page paper is
questionable; neither is possible without
the support of the Alumni; cither is pos-
sible with the co-operative backing of
the Alumni: consequently the size, char-
acter and quality of Tre Davinsontan

THE FRESHMAN CLASS

now that they were thrown on their
own responsibility, to make the best ase
of their time in the nest four years. -He
said that the primary object of a college
man is'to increase and cultivate his in
tellectual powers, and suggested that
every man make out a schedule for prep
aration of each day's lessons, and culti
vate the power of cencentration.

After Dr. Martin had finished, J. B.
Daflin, president of the Senior Class
made a short tal kin which he explained
