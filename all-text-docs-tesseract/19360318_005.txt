PURDY PLANS TOUR

Davidson Quartet Will Accom-
pany the Band

The Davidson College Symphonie
Band will play its annual home con

cert in the Chambers Building au
ditorium at eight o'clock, Friday
evening, March 20. The program

will be the same as that which will
be used throughout the ten-day
tour which begins on March 23

This year the band is presenting
a program which is unusually diffi-
cult for a college organization, but
it is one which has a wide scope of
appeal. It is only because this is
not an ordinary band that such a
program is possible. The “military”
type band could not play many of
the pieces but instruments that
the Davidson Band a sym-
phonic band allow it to play them
efficiently and artistically.

Will Leave Monday

On March 23, the band will leave
on a ten-day tour of three southern
states. . The trip will cover about
a thousand miles of North Carolina,
Georgia, and Tennessee.

There will no admission
charge for the concert here Friday
night, but a free-will offering will
be taken to help the band on the
trip.

be

The band is a self-supporting
organization and receives no help
from the college. The trip was ar-
ranged by R. R. Purdy, business
manager of the band; Ed Johnson,
president;

Harris Bradley,

vice-
president; Wiley Bradley,  seere-
tary-treasurer; the various alumni

organizations; and the college au-
thorities.
Has Varied Program

The program to be presented Fri-
day night includes, before inter-
mission, a chorale, “Sleepers ‘Wake
by Bach;” an
Soyer; a trio for baritones,
“Three Kings,” by Walter Smith;
and “Prelude to Act IIL” of Lohen-
grin and “Bridal Chorus” by Wag-
ner,

After the intermission, during
which the college quartet will sing
several songs, the band will again
take up the program. It will play
“Memories of Stephen Foster,” by
Caillet; “Childhood Fantasy,” by
Lillya; “Blue Danube Waltzes,” by
Strauss, “Semiramide Overture,” by
Rossini; and “O
Shields.

overture, “Ariane,”

Davidson,” by
Quartet to Go

Fifty-one students will leavé next
Monday at four o'clock, for the
members of the quartet will accom-
pany the band. Special request was
made for them so they will render
several numbers of universal appeal.

Elaborate preparations have been
made which promise to make this
the most successful season that the
band has ever had. Attractive pos-
ters in red and black with a pic-
ture of the band in the center haye
been obtained as well as programs
with the names of the members,
the selections to be played, and an
engraving of the Chambers
ing.

Another musical comedy hit for

tunes are: “We Saw the Sea,” “Let

Each Puff Less Acid
A LIGHT SMOKE

OF RICH, RIPE-BODIED TOBACCO

For twenty-five years the research staff

of Thé American Tobacco Company

has worked steadily to produce

H

measurably finer cigarette — namely,

a cigarette having a minimum of vola-
tile components, with an improved rich-
ness of taste—“A LIGHT SMOKE.”

Luckies are

less acid

We believe that Lucky Strike Ciga-
rettes embody a number of genuinely
basic improvements, and that all these
improvements combine to produce a
superior cigarette—a modern ciga-
rette, a cigarette made of rich, ripe-
bodied tobaccos—A Light Smoke.
