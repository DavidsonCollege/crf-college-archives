BROWN RELATES
NEY ANECDOTES

Economics Professor Tells Story
Of Seal Designer On
College Program

The Davidson College program, broad-
cast as usual over station WBT in Char-
lotte at 9:00 P. M., last Friday night,
had as its feature last week a talk by
Dr. C. K. Brown, professor of Eco-
nomics. The concert band, under the
direction of Prof. James C. Pfohl,
formed the principal Bart of the pro-
gram.

The program opened as usual with
the rendition of “O Davidson” by the
band, with “Skip” Brown as announcer.
After the preliminary announcements
the band played “The Belle of Chicago,”
a march by John Phillip Sousa.

Dr. Brown then came to the micro-
phone and gave an instructive talk on
the legend of Marshal Ney of France as
it is believed by the people of this sec-
tion of North Carolina. Dr. Brown
now owns a part of the land on which
Ney is said to have lived, and has col-
lected a great deal of information from
the stories which circulate concerning
the mysterious figure of one Peter Stuart
Ney, who at times claimed to be Na-
poleon’s great lieutenant.

Dr. Brown told how Ney is said to
have escaped execution in France and
to have come to this country, where he
settled in this section of North Caro-
lina. He also told the story of how Ney
designed the Davidson College seal, and
of how he often came to use the David-
son library. Some books now in the library
bear some of Ney’s comments scribbled
on .their margins. Immediately follow-

ing Dr. Brown’s talk the band played
La Marseillaise, the national anthem of
France.

t

“Campus Topics,” weekly news-flashes
from the Davidson campus came next
on the program. Prof. Pfohl then played
cornet solo, “Love's Old Sweet Song,”
accompanied at the piano by Mrs. Pfohl.
Then the full band rendered a choral
entitled “Thy Majesty How Vast It Is.”
The final number on the program was
Massenet’s “The Angelus,” played as a
solo on the organ by Prof. Pfohl.

The program was signed off by the
playing of “O Davidson!” by the college
band during the final announcement.

Whiteman’s Protege
To Be Sabin’s Star

The last thing that you would be likely
to accuse Bob Carter, Paul Sabin's young
soloist of being is a coal miner.

He doesn’t blink when he comes into
the light. He isn’t stoop-shouldered. Al-
though his hair is coal black,

listen to Bob Carter, coal mining just
never enters your mind.

spent his days swinging a pick at the
bottom of a Pennsylvania mine, exercis-
ing the happy, and as it turned out for
him, lucky faculty of singing while he

worked. Here's the way Mr. White-
man tells of his finding of young
Carter:

He was playing on a program in Pitts-
burg, when one of his friends told him
of a young coal miner who had a won-
derful voice. That night about 4 A. M.
Whiteman and his friend went out to
the coal mine and found Carter sitting
on a lump of coal singing with four
other men. Whiteman persuaded Carter
to put away his pick and come t6 New
York with him. Here, after a few les-
sons, he was introduced over the air by
Whiteman as the “singing coal miner.”

This, however, is Mr. Whiteman’s
story. To tell the facts in a straight
way, it must be said that Bob Carter
has never worked in a coal mine in his
tear that he has never shoveled a
bucket of coal. Mr. Whiteman’s story
was one which he used to introduce him
over the air, but he must have had his
facts mixed for he is a very busy man
and it would be hard for him to keep
them straight.

Under Mr. Whiteman’s sponsorship he
soon received bids from several famous
orchestras. He accepted one to sing
with Paul Sabin’s orchestra, which was
then playing at the Tavern in New York.

The true story is that Carter does
come from a mining town which is In-
diana, Pa. One day while Whiteman
was seeking a bit of golf, he stopped
at the home of a friend next door to

Ministerial Band
Discusses Change

Ministerial Candidates Discuss
Deputations And Constitu-
9 tional Changes

A special meeting of the Ministerial
Band was called this past Sunday to dis-
cuss several issues confronting it regard-
ing deputations and the repeal of one

of the amendments of the Constitution.

Under the past status, no ministerial
candidate could secure a key without
having served three years on the band.
The Constitution, under its present re-
vision, allows the member to own a key
after he has served .for one complete
semester. This change was brought
about when it was foreseen that trans
fers from other colleges would be utter-
ly unable to secure a key at all.

Jack Alexander has been appointed
to look after the problem of revising the
order of the key. It was voted that the
key should be changd from the typical
cross to a regular scholastic key. Mr.
Jackson is also aiding in procuring the
desired shape.

Murphy Smith, president of the Min-
isterial Band, expressed the importance
of having as many of the group present
as possible at all the meetings. Deputa-
tions to Charlotte, Mooresville, and other
points are being arranged this week,
and it is necessary that all members help
out insofar as they are capable.

(Interviewed by Richard Vowles)
As Jascha Heifetz, world famous

violinist, appeared on the stage of the
Winthrop College auditorium, a burst
of applause greeted him from the audi-
ence. Mr. Heifetz bowed his apprecia-
tion with a suavity and calm of perfect
stage presence but, like many musicians,
did not proffer his audience the least
trace of a smile. After a careful tuning
of his violin, he began the most brilliant,
