RIS & LIVING

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1995

When did you first begin to
write; what sort of beginnings did
you have?

When I first started to work
here in ‘87, on my break, I just
started reading books from home.
It just started — you know, “roses
are red” — making sentences. It
just started springing out, started
popping up and never stopped —
short sentences of information I
learned in school, things like that.

What things? What most in-
terests you?

I was doing volunteer work at
the Davidson elementary where
my children were going to school,
and I got interested in that type of
work. The children there were
having such a problem with read-
ing. It-was serious. I found within
my family there was the same prob-
lem; it wasn’t critical, but I just
wanted to do what I could to help
my whole family. So that’s why
the rhyme — just seeing if they
could read it back to me.

Poetic Promise

Staff member Verdie Barringer tells .

Do they write any — your
family?

I have a daughter who takes
my poems and critiques them. She

helps me to gather words, sim-

plify, learn what it is I write about.

Who do you read? Who most
influences you?

Dr. Holland, really. Dr. Hol-
land made it all alot more interest-
ing. One of the custodians intro-
duced him to me, just introduced
us, and out of the blue I asked him
if he had time to read some writing
of mine — a paper I had been
writing about children. I just met
up with him and asked him. I’m
not too shy. He took it with him
and kept it-a couple-weeks or so,
and when he gave it back to me
there was along list of information
he wrote on it and never a cut-
down. I’m very happy I got to
meet him ... The poetry just kept
flowing. And I got into a class in
‘92: Dr. Long’s writing class. I
took some of my poetry in to David
— he gave me a lot of time. And I
didn’t think it was supposed to
happen that way. He made time

of being a service worker, a mother, and‘a poet

for me and said he didn’t mind. He
said, ““You’re a staff member, and
staff members are supposed to have
the opportunity to get what they
need in order to help their life on

campus.”

You said you began to write
for children. Why did you con-
tinue —you were successful then.
Why the fascination, why still?

Peace of mind for one thing.
And recognition. Black people

The 1995-96 Artists Series,
sponsored by the Union Board, is
one brimming with energy, diver-
sity and charm. Some of the per-
formances from last year’s series

Terence Blanchard, the fascinat-
ing ODC San Francisco Dance
Troupe, the disturbing message of
Oleanna, and Shakespeare’ s pow-
erful Macbeth.

The first performance of this
year’s Artists Series features the
Chinese Magic Revue. This multi-
faceted production features some
of the most dazzling displays ever
seen — formidable feats of daring
tricks and balancing acts, explo-
sive Kung Fu, brilliantly costumed
traditional dancing and a touch o
Chinese comedy.

These acrobats will appear in

Love Auditorium on Tuesday,

October 3 at 8:15 p.m.

Amos, known for his portrayal of
Kunta Kinte inthe TV seriesRoots,
the father figure in Good Times,

This remarkable tour de force

‘is the hilarious and moving story

of an 87-year-old man who shares
the memories of a lifetime with the
famous comet he saw 76 years

earlieras an 11-year-old boy. Don’t
miss this brilliant performance

Chorale’ includes not only

18th century, but also modern and
contemporary compositions of sa-
cred music.

African dance group which uti-
lizes a unique blend of performing
arts including contemporary mod-
ern dance, traditional west African
dance, and the martial arts. This
breathtaking performance will be

Jumpin’

By Tow.es ALLISON

Whatexactly is Jumpin’ Java?
In simple terms, it can be described
asa place to enjoy coffee, munchies
(for those tempting study breaks),
music, and several different. pro-
grams sponsored by the outpost.
Best of all, Jumpin’ Java is free of
charge. Who could turn down free
food and flavored coffee? Dona-
tions are apprecfated. (Standard
donations are 25 and 50 cents).

This year, Jumpin’ Java is
more exciting than ever. The Out-
post Committee, in conjunction
with the Union Board, has created
an atmosphere that complements
Patterson Court while adding a
touch of diversity. In order to offer
alternatives to students, the Union
and the Outpost have gotten to-
gether to make life at Davidson
entertaining for all. For instance,
the Union sponsors a movie every
Friday night, and on Saturday night
an event is sponsored, whether it
be Saturday Night Live in the 900
Room or an impromptu jam ses-
sion or poetry reading at Jumpin’
Java.

night, Catherine Palmer and Diane
