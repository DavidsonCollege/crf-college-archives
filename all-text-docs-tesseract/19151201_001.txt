Senior Oratorical Exercises
Best That Have Yet Been Held

Varied Array of Subjects All Showed Good Preparation---Other

Entertainments

The European War naturally fur-
nished themes for the greater part of the
speeches in the recent Senior Oratorical
exercises, and our own part in the future
world affairs proved to be a favorite
topic for the prophetic abilities of the
class. Preparedness seemed to be the
class hobby; for in one breath the nation
was urged to preserve peace, and to arm
for possible war. This was especially
true of the Friday afternoon section.
The Philanthropic Society dominated
the afternoon events, and showed evi-
dences of its good training.

Friday night was as a whole the best
of the entire speaking. Farrior and
Finley were united in their denunciation
of Equal Suffrage, and Finley’s picture
of woman’s present dominence over the
masculine element of the species drew a
laugh from the audience. Hay’s biog-
raphy of Tolstoi was a gem of its kind.
and Law’s philosophical oration on
Memory carried the listeners high in the
realms of oratory and imaginations.
Hollister made the “hit” of the evening
by his plucky repetition of a good oration
on Turkey’s precarious position in the
status of ‘international affairs, The
lights went out in the middle of his
speech, because of the rainstorm, and
though he was willing to finish it. at Dr.
McConnell's suggestion he repeated it
‘entire when the lights reappeared.

Saturday morning's audience had the}.

pleasure of hearing some of Sixteen’s
strongest speakers. Mullins’ delivery
of his defense of Wilson and denuncia-
tion of Bryan, under the title of “Et tu,
Brute,” left nothing to be desired. W.
G. Morrison and H. W. Ormond, on
College Educational Defects and Nitro-
gen, respectively, held the audience casi-
lv until the conclusion of their speeches.
The feature of the morning was easily
J. G. Patton's speech on the Prohibition
question under the subject “I’m Pretty
Much of a Fool.” Patton is the win-
ner of last year's Junior Orator’s medal,
and will undoubtedly be a strong con-
testant for the Senior Orators’ medal.
The afternoon session brought its
share of good oratory as well. Smith’s
speech, “Clefts in the War Clouds,” a
plea for peace. was perhaps the best
speech of the entire program. Perry, on
Germany's ‘““Weltpolitik.” and Sparrow,
on the South, also plaved stellar roles in
this session. This trio are all strong
speakers, and are among the foremost in
the forensic exercises on the campus.
As a whole the class of 1916 proved
itself stronger alone oratorical lines
than any in several years. From its
ranks are sure to come some who will
reflect glorv on old Davidson. Their
exercises were a tremendous success, and
their congratulations were well won.
Y. M. C. A. RECEPTION
The informal reception given by the
Y. M. C. A. last Friday night in place
of the usual Facultv Recention to the
Senior Class, and held in the new
Social Center, was in the nature of a
house-warming and opening of the Cen-
ter. The walls were tastefully decor-
ated with pennants and pictures.
Immediately upon the termination of
the orations in Shearer Hall, the recep-

Also Enjoyed.

tion was held. Soon the hall was filled
with a gay assembly, and a pleasant few
hours were spent by all. During the
evening cream and cakes were served.
_ This Social Center hall is expected to
fill a great need here at Davidson -in
providing a place where the fellows can
meet together for amusement or discus
sion, and it is hoped that the students
will take advantage of this new oppor-
tunity. The room will be kept warm.
and magazines will be placed there.

The thanks of the student body are
tendered to the ladies of the town who
so kindly aided in decorating and equip-
ping the room, and to Dr. Arbuckle for
his gift of a stove.

BASKET BALL GAME

A very interesting exhibition game of
basket ball was played on Saturday aft
ernoon between the Sophs and the Fresh.
The game was fast and ‘until the last it
seemed that the Fresh would certainly
win. The score at the end of the first,
half was 11 to 6 in favor of the Fresh.
But in the last half the Sophs began te
pull up and the game ended with the
Sophs leading by a score of 18 to 15.
The game was watched bv a large num
ber of the visiting young ladies.

‘The line-up was as follows:

Sophs (18) Position Fresh (15)
Childs. ..... ... Forward .... Nimocks
King.......... Forward . . Davenport
Worth.........Center...... . Potts
Walker........ Guard... . McAskill
Vherrell.. 0. 0.. Guard ..... Boswell

Referee, Perry (16).
Attendance, about 60.
GYM EXHIBIT

At the close of the Oratorical F:xer-
cises Saturday evening the Gym Team
vave their annual exhibition. A large
crowd of visiting ladies and students
watched the performance. The team
was largely composed of last year’s men
who went through the program without
a hitch until they reached the last num-
ber on the program, horizontal bar
work, when as fate would have it, the
bar broke.

The work of Minter and Alford as
clowns added very much to the amuse-
ment of the evening.

RECEPTION AND CONCERT
AT QUEENS COLLEGE

The Davidson students who attended
the reception at Queens College follow
ing the concert given by the Davidson
Orchestra and Glee Club were privi
leged to spend a most enjoyable eveniny

The program for the concert. includ
ing both Orchestra and Glee Club sclec
tions, consisted of thirteen numbers, the
last number being a Glee Club selection
written bv McIlwaine, of the class of
1915. Many of the selections received
a hearty, vigurous encore.

After the concert a reception was ten-
dered in the parlors of the main build-
ing. Punch was served in the reception
rooms, on each side of the main hall.
The hospitable style in which the
Queens girls entertained the Davidson
bovs leaves pleasant memories of a pleas-
antly spent evening.

Davidson Concludes Successful

Season by Defeating Wake Forest

Opponents Unable to Stop Rush of Red and Black Machine---Black
the Star of the Contest.

Once more Davidson's
prowess on the gridiron against Wake
Forest, her old and worthy rival, has
been demonstrated. “Phe rwo thousand
spectators who on ‘Thanksgiving Day
assembled at Wearn field. Charlotte,
saw the Red and Black Machine, for
the sixth successive vear, defeat the
heavy Baptist eleven by a 21 to 7 score.

Before the game even conservative
predictions pointed to a close game, with
the odds in favor of Wake Forest, be
cause of her superior weight and experi-
ence; but the first few minutes of plav
made it clearly evident that Coach Fet
zer's well drilled eleven was outclassing

INDIVIDUAL PLAYING

To name the star players for David
son would be to name the team, but
standing out to itself was the hard, ag
gressive work of Black at left-half, who
time after time circled the Wake Forest
wings for long gains. Capt. C. Walker.
at right-half, was a consistent ground-
gainer and a tower of strength on the
defensive. Laird, at full, often went
through the Wake Forest line for good
gains. Keesler and Lawson, at quarter,
ran the team in an admirable manner.

good interference, was easily a feature of
the game. In the line, King, Sayad and
B. N. White were in every play. both in
stopping the line bucks of Parker, and
in opening up holes for Laird to enter
for pains.

Kor Wake Forest, Parker, at full, and
Pace, at right-half, did consistent work.
Pace’s 20-vard drive through center at
the beginning of the second half for a
touchdown on a delayed pass was a
clever feature of the game for Wake
Forest. After Davidson’s secondary de-
