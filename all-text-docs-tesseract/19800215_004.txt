A pilot project conducted by
the Parents Council in associa-
tion with the Experiential
Learning/Life Work Planning
program is now under way,
according to Matthew Coving-
ton, Secretary of the Parents
‘Council. The Parents Council is
a group of 100 couples who are
parents of current Davidson
students; it is a subgroup of the
Parents Association, which in-
cludes the parents of all David-
son students, past and present.

The pilot project is a limited

experiential program whereby

parents of Davidson students
offer internship and externship
opportunities to other Davidson
students. It differs from the
Experiential Programs offered
by Ken Wood’s office in two
important aspects.

“First,’’ said Covington, “‘the
parents program is much more
limited in scope—only parents
of current Davidson students
participate. Secondly, more
publicity is possiblé; because of
the fewer number of actual
offerings, we will be able to
publicize all offerings.”’

A major advantage of the
smaller, more concentrated pro-
gram is the high degree of flex-

Media Board to pick yearbook editor

Interviews for the editorship of the Quips and.Cranks yearbook
will be conducted by the Media Board Monday, February 18, from
2 to 4 p.m. No one filed for the position in the December elections.

Media Board Chairman John Willingham said, ‘I’m sorry it’s
gotten down to this, but one. of the powers of the Board is to

appoint. editors when necessary .’’ Willingham said the Board would ,

question applicants on their ideas, experience, and qualifications
for the position.

The Board's decision will be made Monday evening. Interested
persons should contact Willingham for an interview time.

ibility possible. ‘‘After I send a
letter of introduction to the
sponsoring parent,’’ said Cov-
ington, “subsequent contacts
and coordination of the program
are between student and _par-
ent.”’ This enables the student
to design an intern- or extern-
ship best suited to his own
needs. The options are “very
broad as to when and under
what terms” the student will
participate in his chosen pro-
gram.

“We're not competing with
Ken Wood,” Covington empha-
sized. In fact, Wood helped
design the program in the initial
stages. ‘We plan to give the
project a one year trial period,
from January ‘80 to January
‘81. If successful, it may feed
into Ken's program.”

Brochures eiplaining the pro-
gram were mailed to parents the
first week in January. Coving-
ton has received an ‘‘excellent
response from parents.” A few
of the.responses received thus
far include offerings for exper-
iential opportunities in manu-
facturing, computer program-
ming, gemology, observation of
police department procedure in
Ft. Lauderdale, teaching Social
Studies at Freedom High
School in Morganton, observa-
tion of training for a surgical
career by a cardiac surgeon in

Wisconsin, mass merchandising -

and retail management with
Richway Department Stores,
and music therapy for retarded
citizens. A North Carolina Su-
perior Court judge has offered

experiences in law enforcement, _

the judiciary process, probation
and parole procedure, and court
reporting.

Covington attributes the re-
sponse to the fact that those
contacted are parents of current
students. Most of these parents
are not alumni and have no real
contact with the college except

that their sons or daughters are ©

enrolled here. Parents are eager
to “respond to a more substan-
itial role in the.life of the college.
The fact that they do have
students makes them sympa-
thetic to students exploring for
careers,” . He
added that ‘lot all of the

Some involve “hobbies or avo.

cations,” or simply “‘a unique
interesting outlook on life.” a

sponsibility for the mechanics.

of special events, such as Trus-
tees meetings and Spring Con-
vocation. He just finished engi-
neering the Stuart Scholarship
semi-final week-end, as the only
liaison officer between the scho-
larship committee and the col-
lege staff.

His job includes everyday
work, such as research for Dr.
Spencer, processing of educa-
tional surveys, and working
with other offices. Cunningham
has also enjoyed interviewing
for the admissions office when it
has been over-loaded. It is
evident by the number of notes
handed to him by secretaries in
the space of ten minutes, that
the job keeps him busy. The
strict office hours during the
day allow less freedom than he
had as a student, but after 5:00,
he can usually leave his work
behind him.

Cunningham had several rea-
sons for taking his job, al-
though he had ‘not. seriously
considered it until last spring.
When this opportunity came, he
applied and was accepted for
the position. “I’m really high on
people working before they go

‘to grad school,” said Cunning-

ham enthusiastically. ‘‘This
job, and other jobs like it in
the Union and the admissions
office, are a great way to take a
year off, get experience, and
still be in a fun place.”

For Cunningham, taking a
year off to work has provided

good opportunity to see what he,
likes and dislikes about a job.

cord” because he hasn't “quit.”
- Cunningham’s job puts him
in a unique position. Now he
sees the administration’s side of
a problem, while still remem.
bering the students’ side. He
recalls that, as a student, he felt
frustrated because certain
things were wrong with David-
son. Now he realizes that these
same problems are common to
most campuses. Difficulties
with faculty salaries, and at-
tracting more black students
are not limited to Davidson.
They are national problems.

Cunningham enjoys his posi-
tion. “It’s fun to see Davidson
from a different: perspective.”
Not being involved in classes,
he has been able to meet faculty
members on a different level—
free from inhibition. The most
interesting part of the job has
been working with the college
staff: Cunningham has disco-
vered that the staff members
and secretaries; whom he didn’t
know as a student, are all ‘‘fun
people.”

Another benefit for Cunning-
ham in staying at Davidson an
extra year has been being able
to keep in touch with members
of his class. Graduates keep
coming back to visit the cam-
pus, and Cunningham’s apart-
ment often resembles a hotel.

The purpose of the position
“Assistant to the President”’ is
not training for work in college
administration. Graduates with
many different ambitions have
done the job. Some have stayed
in administration, one has gone
into the military, and many
have gone to law school after
they finished.
