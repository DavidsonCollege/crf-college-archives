Career

By SHELLEY BEARD
With a warm lilting contralto a red-headed young woman
from South Carolina gives Davidson a rich. taste of old folk
tunes as she pfesents the second program in the current artist

series tonight. Miss Susan Reed is now
although born and reared in Columbia,

was the organizer of the Little
Theatre.

Miss Reed began her career as
a painter, Odd as this may seem
she only started to sing when the
USO called for help in entertain-
ing wounded soldiers. With her
zither she was able to sing at the
bedside without need of other ac-
companiment. The more she did
the more she felt she ought to do
and soon it became a full time
occupation. Now whenever she
gets a chance she visits veterans
hospitals to sing to the men.

Being her own arranger she
travels in the summer throughout
various isolated areas in search of
tunes that the inhabitants have
preserved for generations, This
summer she spent some time in
Currituck County on the island of
Wanchese near Manteo in search
of material. She now has a large
library of songs and. ballads, many
of which she has not had time to
learn. In fact the middle group of
songs that she will sing with the
instrumental trio is entirely new
to the concert stage.

While she is not on tour or in
search of fresh material she. spends
her time in New York with her
husband, actor James: Carran who
appeared in “A Streetcar Named
Desire” and is currently with a
musical by the writers of ‘“Briga-
doon.” Her father opened Wednes-
day in Maxwell Anderson's new
play, “Barefoot in Athens,” which
is about Socrates. Her brother is
also to open in about a week in a
musical.

With such a family it is only na-
tural that she‘ feels at home in

Permission for the D Club
to hold a dance open to both
Davidson and State students in
Charlotte after the Davidson-
State game was not granted
by the executive committee.

President Ham Wade asked
for an off-campus site thinking
that it would not appeal to the
students to come all the way
back to Davidson for the dance.

“The executive committee
might have acted differently if
the dance had been limited to
Davidson students and faculty.”
commented Dean John Bailey.

feeling had been outlined by the
faculty. They were given an O.K.

Dean John Bailey was quoted
as saying that it is the general
feeling of the faculty that dances
held here are not only less expen-
sive, but more conducive to the
proper standard of conduct ex-
pected of Davidson men.

“One must remember that if a
student acts ungentlemanly away
from school, it is not he but the
school’s name that is remembered,”
reminded Bailey.

front of the lights, and as a singer
she has done numerous guest ap-
pearances on TV with programs
bossed by such personalities as
Faye Emerson, Kate Smith, Ika
Chase and Arthur Godfrey. She has
sung for the President and other
leading figures, but Mrs. Roose-
velt proved to be her most appre-
ciative audience,

In her informal way she spoke
of the different personages and
stars that she had met and worked
with. “Some of thent are really a
disappointment and you wonder
how they got as far as they did.
Most are just people with human
problems.” ,

Besides painting and singing
there ip one other interest which
she ‘pursuers even while on tour,
and that is antique. collecting.
Thursday she went into Charlotte
to visit the various dealers, but it
seems their prices are higher than
in New York.

While mentioning the
places she had heen Miss Reed
said that it was particularly nice
to work with Mr. Pfohl again, «5
she had opened the summer con-
cert season at Brevard for him.
“Every community,” she puts in,
“should have a man that works as
hard and as energetically a» Mr.
Pfoht.”

Miss Reed, although not one of
the biggest names on the series,
is one of the most interesting, per-
sonalities, With her talent she is
not only adding to the enjoyment
of many people bur alsy helping to
keep alive a quickly dying part of
the national culture.

“Many parents eerid their
sons to Davidson because it
does maintain some supervision
over the social life of its stu-
dents.” he affirmed.

In reference to the oft-confused
and discussed situation in which
a group of individuals from a fra-
ternity desiré to have a party, but
are prohibited since it’ is deemed
a regular function, Bailey noted
that there war nv written rule to
limit this.

“It has been the custom of the
exeettive committee to forbid such
a.dunction if it scems an obvious
attempt to elude the rule which bars
fraternities from having more than
two off-campus = functions — per
year.” Bailey observed.

He pledged to try to get the
executive committee to issne a fair-
ly definite statement of policy in
dealing with this matter.

LUCK DODGES ...

They hardly had standing room
and little to eat. For eight
days they traveled until they
reached a prison on the Baltic
Sea.

The main trouble in the cxtmps
was obtaining something to eat,
for the Germans gave them very
little food, and it was practically
impossible to obtain extra rations.
The Russians got pretty close to
this camp and then began what is
known as the German Death
March.

Food In a Pig Kettle

The prisoners had to sleep out
in the open in the cold and ice.
Little was available to eat, except
what they could beg, borrow or
steal, or when they reached a farm
where extra potatoes could be ob-
tained. These were dumped in a.
big kettle, used usually to cook
food for pigs, and cooked, dirt and
all, ,

Here is what Capt. T.eslie Cap-
lon said about this march, “We
were on the road for 86 days dur-
ing which we marched, starved
froze, marched, scratched our lice,
suffered in filth, and slept in barns
or fields. We covered 600 miles,

“For food we averaged 770 calo-
ries a day (An Anterican soldier
gets 3,500 calories a day.) Our sani-
tation, was nightmarish, The in-
evitable result was suffering, di-
sease and death,”

Of the nine in Doug's crew,
he and three others survived.
The reat gave their lives in
prison and on this march. Doug
wag one of the lucky ones. No
one knows exactly how many
made it and how many didn't.
He was liberated by the 10th
Division of the Eighth Army,
the “Terry Timberwolves.” ,

In 1946 Doug entered Davidson
in the spring semester. He was
vice-president of the “D" Club,
a member of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, national leadership fraternity,
and in Kappa Sigma Fraternity
where he served as boarding house
wianager and vice-president, The
freshmen of 1950 knew him very
well as the Judge of the Court of
Control. He graduated with a B.S.
I degree, majoring in Economics.

Doug played football, baseball,

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2. 1951

and wrestled during his college ca-
reer. As wingback he was one of
the spark plugs of the Davidson
team. He won the praise of coaches
and sportswriters alike and seemed
about to become one of the finest
of all Davidson football players.

Fatal Third Game

In the third game in 1947 he
tore a cartilage in his leg which
knocked him out of the remainder
of the season. Next year he was
rohbed of his chanee by an over-
developed “charley horse.” After
football season he went’ out for
wrestling and a broken vertebrae
kept him in a cast for six painful
weeks,

He came fighting back the next
year, but a painful leg injury closed
the door on his football activities.

Stud in Black

Doug is now managing the
“Stud” and it is clearly in the
black. He has a commission in the

Army which he obtained through
ROTC and-is in the inactive rev)

serves. For the future he only says
that he has several irons in the
fire, It's doubtful theyll be too
hot for Doug to handle.

PROTESTANTS EASE .. .

for he believed that such a con-
troversial issue should be settled by

Congress,

Chaplain Gripe, commenting
further on the. matter, said “Stu-
dents and faculty members. still
doubting the gravity of this issue

and the threat of the political
power of the Catholic Church
should read Paul  Blanshard's

American Freedom. and Catholic
Power, a copy of which is in the
