tEnow the writer spoke the truth when

‘The DAVIDSONIAN, April 4, 1917

world. All humans are like sheep, which
ha: been said before. May I not take an
humble place in this great wave of
reformation which is sweeping over the
college, and give my ideas?

The question discussed by a writer in
a recent issue of THe Davipsonian
was whether the Student Council is do-
ing its duty or not, and why. In it, we
are told of practically everything that
occurred in a late meeting of this body,
even to the Council's opinion as to what
the student body would do in case those
convicted should appeal to it over the
Council's decision, There is a Council
law forbidding the Councilmen to repeat
anything said or done in their meetings.
We wonder how the writer of this
article deduced his facts? Has the Stu-
dent Council ordered its minutes pub-
lished, and appointed someone to do it?
Or has a councilman been spreading in-
formation? If the latter is the case, can
a Student Council that disregards its
own rules, force a student body to obey
them?

But it is evident that 1 am knocking
the Student Council. It seems to me
that a person who runs down the Coun-
cil, and yet does nat know how to better
it (by writing a new constitution, for in-
sance), is a hypocrite. Since [ am con-
fident of the fact that 1 could not im-
vrove the Student Council, | must be a
hypocrite,

Moreover, the author of the article
mentioned above states from his wide
knowledge of things, that the Student
Council has argued for five or six hours
at a time on such questions as “What is
repeated drunkenness?” Might a hum-
ble beginner in the ranks of [literature
suggest that a good definition of this is
“Being drunk more than once ?”

Another article in “Tig Davinsoxtan
suggests that official whippings be intro-
duced into the college for minor offenses.
Surely the writer of this article has
enough college spirit not to wish his
college transformed into a kindergarten!
A college in which ‘a student would of-
ficially thrash his best friend, in’ order
to punish him for same minor offence
would be a college indeed. Sir Thomas
Moore might Have well included such
a college in his Utopia!

Can we knockers not let the Studen
Council do its best, however poor thi
may be? Or do we prefer to have mem-
bers of the Faculty reside in the dormi-
tories, and take charge of the discipline
of the college ?

The F orum

WHAT IF WAR COMES?

Rumors of war fill the air. Indeed
even war itself knocks at our door, and
it seems that it will break down the
threshold of our very nation in spite of
our earnest efforts to keep it outside. A
condition of war would call for decision
and quick action from many noble hearts
all over our country, and we ate proud
of our college, who would surely do her

What is our part? A band, thre
hundred and _ seventy-five strong, we
stand ready to serve in the cause of right
and justice, but of what will our service
consist, True, each will enlist in tha’
service for which he is best fitted, yet it
seems to the writer that some in our
‘umber are best suited for some par-
ticular tasks.

‘There are in our midst those who
heuld be skilled chemists. These I dare
say would seek service in the secluded
and protected laboratories of the nation.
And the physicists, too, would probably
try to get into the ammunition factories.
Because of their special training the
Freshmen would be excellent members
of a band of infantry. Is it unreasonable
‘o suppose that the. ministerial band
would shun the position as chaplains?
All have had a good deal of experience
in “shooting,” and, in one sense, would
make excellent marksmen.

Consider these things and then your
awn individual accomplishments, and
then if you cannot fulfil the require-
ments, go to Plattsburg next summer.

Two weeks ago we read a long article
about the Student Council and why it
“as not staying on the job. We = all

he made that statement, but, what I
say is, if it can’t held down the job, let
vs abolish the Student Council. Why
chould we have a bunch of spies sneak-
‘ng around the campus to see when we
gentlemen plav a game of poker, or take
a few drinks of the good old “corn,” or
heat up a few Freshmen in a friendly
‘vay? What business is it of their's if
we do those things? Why, every one
keows a man is a “sissy” if he doesn’t
plav poker, drink and haze Freshmen.

Then that writer said something about
reporting being “the base rock of the
honor system,” or something like that.
T expect he meant to sav that we all
ought to report things. Well, I have
talked it over with my friends and we
have. decided that any man, who says we
ought to report, is a fool, or worse, as it
is against human nature, and therefore,
as vou can't go against human nature.
we won't report anything except out and
out cheatine on reviews or exams. Even
then we will go mightv slow. Of course
we know that it is against human nature
to be polite all the time, and yet we try
to be as polite as we can; that it is
against human nature to wear clothes
and to eat with knives. forks and spoons,
and yet we do wear clothes and we do
vse knives, forks and spogns instead of
ovr fingers: that it is against human na-
ture to studv or do other things when
we don’t want to, and yet we often
study under protest and compulsion, and
do manv things that we don’t want to
do; and that it is against human nature
to do right, and yet we try to do right.
But we claim that all these and many
others are exceptions to the rule, as we
think reparting is against human nature.
of course we simply can not do it.

CITIZENS’ RIFLE CLUB
IS ORGANIZED HERE

The citizens of Davidson met recent
ly and decided to organize a Citizens’
Rifle Club. “Phe purpose of this club
will be to promote marksmanship. ‘Phere
is no military obligation whatever con-
nected with it, and the organization will
be carried on in much the same way as
the college club. “Phe two clubs will use
the same rifle range and have the same

ville. Supplies, such as rifles and am-
munition, will be furnished at cost by th:
sovernment. The officers of this club
have not been elected yet, but probably
will be soon. There are at present about
twenty-five members, and it is hoped
thar others will join.

There seems to be a tendency of late
among members of the Student Bodv to
‘allow the lead of the fictitious Don
QOnuixote. and give their efforts to right

The plans for the College Rifle Club
are still being perfected. The names of
those that have joined have been handed
into the faculty for approval. They will
then be sent to the government. The
securing of the rifles at present is doubt-
ful. Owing to the crisis in our relations
with Germany, the War Department is
hesitant as to the granting of govern-
ment arms to private citizens. However,
Dr. J. W. McConnell thinks that with-
in a few weeks the rifles will be ready
for the members.

The work on the range will probably
begin when Captain Frazer, who is at
home for a few days, returns,
