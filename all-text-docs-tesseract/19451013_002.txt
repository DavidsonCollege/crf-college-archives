The Editor Says. .

This editorial is soley dedicated to
those men-who have just recently been
elected to lead our college this year in its
various activities.

It was only a short while after the
opening of this fall semester when, new
student body,. class and various other
officers assumed the responsibility of
leading the campus_life here at Davidson,
amidst such talks to the retiring officers
lations and thanks to the retiring officers
for their well done work. There were
promises of faithfulness, and a realization
of responsibility and a determination to
build toward better things in all respects.

There have been a good many men in “

the years past who have accepted the re-
sponsibility of leadership on this campus.
Their responsibilities ‘and accomplish-
ments have been varied. Some have had
harder times than others. Some have re-
ceived unearned praise, and some unde-
served criticism. However, the majority
have been faithful to their office and to
those who put them iff. They have done a
good job—as well as has been possible,
and to this group go the thanks and ap-
preciation of the student body.

Your new responsibility always seems
too great, else, it isn’t worth having. Un-
less you may profit by your position, you
should not have it, and the profit that may
come to you is dependent on the quanity
and quality of that which you put into
your certain job.

The time for new hopes and plans is
at hand. Our leaders at present seem quite
capable. Some few will falter, but the
ones that come thru are the ones that
make it all worth while. You have filled
well the vacancies left you. You have the
ability which leaves only the question of
the will to work, of which no one can pro-
phesy.

Your accomplishment can: be deter-
mine din many ways. To some it may

mean your actual results. But all persons
can not be judged on an equal basis. It
should be made on a basis of relative
ability—the amount possible to be ac-
complished by each person.

You have made an excellent start this
year, and I commend each of you for your
work, And I have no doubt that in the
future you will continue to serve the col-
lege in as best as it is possible. “Honor to
the man who does the best, but the highest
honor is reserved for him who does HIS
best”.

Campus Music...

Can you image what a college would
be like if it had no musical organizations ?
Possibly not, for it isn’t that way at
Davidson, and certainly never will be.
‘Yet, have many of you ever stopped to
consider how much music adds to college
life and activities? If you never have
now is, the time to do so. Recall for a

* moment how much the band added to the
game last week. Those of you who were
here last year will recall the various trips

the band-and-glee-elub-madelast-year.It—

took. months of hard work and practice
to accomplish what they did. It was no
push-over !

Already this year plans have been
laid for many excellent performances. It
is the duty of each member of the stu-
dent body to support this, organization.
Won’t you do your part?

Tasks of Peace...

With the ending of World War
IT, all Americans are taking stock of their
achievements and of the task ahead.. We
at Davidson should do the same,

We may be proud of our part in
America’s victory. As college students ‘we
could not do many things we would like
to have done, but we did what we could
and did it well. Now, perhaps, many of us
feel that with the ending of the war the
excitement and glamour which made us
achieve more than we ever thought we
could is gone. This is not true. The in-
centive is still here; to bring lasting peace
to the world. The tasks, too, are still with
us, but they will be much harder than our
wartime exertions because they are harder
to see and define.

We have won the war against the
Japanese and Germans, but we have not
yet won the real war—against intolerance,
international selfishness, oppression, and
need. Perhaps there is not much that we
Davidson men can do about these things,
but as long as there is a world we will
keep trying to improve it. If we here
build up within ourselves a feeling for
tolerance, cooperation, and common sense,
and combine it with the conviction and
strength to make our voices heard, we,
as college men of America, can do more
than we may think,

The tasks of peace are harder than
the tasks of war. But they are even more
worth doing.

Pi Kappa Phi
Several Pi Kapps have been in-

quiring about Don Whittemore’s
trips to Hickory (Lenoir-Rhyne).
Seems that some of them, would
like to accompany him, Too bad he
doesft have enough cuts for a third
week-end.

Seems that Pete Sinclair was dis-
appointed in the recent theatrical
production he attended in Charlotte.
Maybe you expected toq much,
Pete.

The recent “pooper scooter” ac-
cident didn’t prevent Walker and
Barksdale from using it to go to
Concord last Sunday night. Must be
some strong attraction there.

The Pi Kapps were well repre-
sented at Queens last week-end. It
seems that the newest pledge, Man-
uel, has that old South American
technique well developed, We un-
derstand that he was a great help
in getting our North Carolina
friends dates.

Wonder why Don Tyler was so
late in getting back from Florence
Sunday night. Maybe he ran into an
old friend who found that new girl
he’s been looking for.

Louis Paller and Allan Mead came
back with a lot of interesting stor-
ies about their, week-end at Win-
throp. Let’s hear more boys!

Walker must—have liked his re-
cent date with a certain Queens
girl. Anyway, he’s dating her for the
coming Queens-Davidson Day. More
power to you.

Wonder what Sonny Blain will
think about Mel Winsteads atten-
tions toward a certain Concord girl.
Mel seems to have a fine idea for
the future. You'll all get to see her
at Homecoming.

Nisbet goes .to Kannapolis fre-
quently to see his dentist. When
will he be going to Duke to see his
dentist’s daughter? It won't be very
long,

Newlin Schenck was terribly wor-
ried last week when he didn’t hear

her_letter was found in another
person’s box, He says that this is
true love. . . . So were the last
three or four.

Kappa Alpha

The KA’s got off to a bad start
in interfraternity touch, but they are
consoling themselves with the fact
that hey are best represented in
freshmen appearing before the
Court of Control. Don’t think so?
Well try and top Harris’s record.
He’s really a nice fellow at heart
—He says!

Pledge Giles Beal and Pledge
Leighton Choate seem to be letting
their love life get them down. By
the way, they wish to be known as,
“The most in love at Davidson”, so
rub it in good fellows, as I am
getting tired of hearing about, as
they quaintly put it, their itsy, bitsy
‘love spots,

Pledge. Charles Cunningham and
Pledge. Bob Spilman seem to be
having their ups' and downs in West,
with Cunningham rubbing baby-
faced Spilman’s profile in the floor-
boards every night. Spilman’s motto
is, and I quote, “Some of us have
it and some don’t”. Spilman thinks
that Cunningham was cheated by
the genes,

Moan can’t seem to make up his

mind who the lucky girl will be in
Charlotte this year, but we think
the lucky could be changed to un-
lucky—That means a count-off for
me, but it was worth it.

Dana Drake is acquiring the re-
putation at Queens, as being the
fastest student on the Davidson
Campus.. He says, and I borrow
from Gunn: “Tis better to have
tried and failed, than never to have
tried at all”.

Sigma Phi Epsilon

Everyone has been enjoying the
nice open fires in the Sig Ep house.
They seem to add that homelike
atmosphere. Believe me, it's ideal
when there’s no heat in the dormi-
tory.

Who is it that Charlie Owens
would rather take to the movies
than to the Sig Ep Feed? Couldn't
be Splash—or-could-it? And=won-
der why?

Sam Lineberger seemed to be
very happy the night before the
Sig Ep Feed. I heard it was because
he had a date with Laura Barefoot
for the game and feed. He was down
in the dumps at the feed. It seems
that Laura stood him up.

Meredith Davison keeps a far-
away look in His eyes. By way of
“ye ole grapévine’, I hear that there
is a little cadet nurse out in Katisas.
He just cant do without her.

Most of the Sig Ep pledges had
dates for the feed after the Appa-
lachian game, ~What happened to
the brothers? They said they just
couldn't get dates. Too. bad—the
boys are slipping! Or are they? It
seems that they did a lot of snak-
ing on the boys who did have dates.
» Z. Holler was trying to get some-
one to take one date off his hands
so he could get another. It seems
that Z just can’t do without the
little woman at Greensboro College.

Joe Brown doesn’t seem to have
enjoyed his trip to the Court of
Control. He has promised that from
now on ‘he will be less obnoxious.
zWe wonder!

Arthur Jenkins was terribly wor-
tied when some upperclassmen ad-
vised him to have a date for the
Queens-Davidson day. Don’t tell me
that he’s afraid of women.

Alex ‘Donald still blushes when
someone mentions the little red-
head he had up for a dance last
year. He gives no excuse except
that he “can’t help it”.

What happened to Carlyle Charles
last week-end? His date was seen
many times with many’ people.
Where was Carlyle? Don't let them
do that to you, especially when
she’s so cute.

Pi Kappa Alpha

Why is it that Page Jackson goes
to W. C. so often? I don't blame
you. That’s a nice place to go.

Brother Neal was supposed to
have a hold on some Texas cactus
late Saturday night, Stiles Markey
feels that Sullin’s girls are really
smooth, dancers.

Who visited the “Bamboo Room,”
the Tavern and the Carolina Pines
last | week. It sounds like a good
time. Robert Riggs went to the in-
stitutions Saturday night. “Ain’t that
rite, Smoak’,

Why does Brother Courson like
