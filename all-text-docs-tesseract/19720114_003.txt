Strange Wildlife Abounds
On Farm Near Davidson

By BILL GIDUZ
Staff Writer

Upon their first trip into
Charlotte, many Davidson fresh-
men are somewhat unnerved by
the sight of llamas or an occa-
sional water buffalo grazing
nonchalantly in’ a pasture on
the left side of the road about
a mile past the Wher-Rena Mar-
ina.

Most students soon become
accustomed to the sight of the
unusual beasts, but a nagging
curiosity as to the reason jor
their being lingers on. The story
is not really so mysterious: they
are there simply because a_ 60
year old) man, John Cooke,
enjoys raising them.

“They were scarcer than they
are now when | first started
getting them. | just wanted to
see what | could do with them,
and | also knew where | could
get them,” Cooke said. He went
on to point out that the animals
he raises aren‘t that easy to
come by.

In addition to his five Hamas
and single buffalo, he
has two regular buffalo, ses
eral half buffalo. eight shag
gy Scotch highland cows and
some regular domestic cattle.

His herd has always been
changing since he purchased his
first lamas and buffalo ten
years ago. He has owned a vak
and several elk which he has
since traded or sold.

Profit is not Cooke's motive
in keeping the animals. ‘‘1 don’t
have to have much to live cn,
if | did !‘d be broke.”

Some of the animals bring a
handsome price. though. On the
rather limitcd market. a female
llama will bring $700. a male
merely $200. His Indian water
buffalo, which he obtained in

water

Tennessee by trading an. elk,

would bring Cooke about $600 it
he were to sell her.

The water buffalo is the most
temperamental member of the
menagerie. She Ci:appears into
the thick brush for weeks at a
time, emerging only when she
fets huogry enough. Cooke com-

mented that the water buffalo’s
milk js supposed to be very
rich, but he’s never confirmed
that report.

Half buffalo, or cattle, are
exactly that: half buffalo, half
cattle. They are far from be-
ing the dumb animals many
people may think them fo be,
however.

Speaking of one in particular,
Cooke said, ‘‘When she gets
hungry she comes up to the
bain and starts begging. You
can hear her grunting.” They
are also capable of simple
tricks, and Cooke hopes to teach
them some when he gets time.

To many people, llamas are
fascinating creatures, and it is
easy to see why upon close ex-
amination. They all have a very
curious, intemt look when a
Visitor approaches, and seem
to think themselves above the
other animals nearby.

What do you do with five
llamas in Huntersville, N. C.?
At $700 per female, Mr. Cooke
breeds and sells them. He ex-
plained that one man bought a
llama as a pet for his grand-
children. In their native South
America, their wool is used for
clothing, but there aren‘t many
people in this area with an
interest in weaving llamas wool.

Cooke does hope eventually to
find someone willing to take
on the job. “‘They don’t cost
anything to keep, I just put out
a little bit of grain every once
in a while; they just live right
on.”

Cooke has never had any real
problem with his animals. A
half buffalo escaped and was
gone for four months when some-
one ran into his fence not long
ago. It was spotted cn several
occasions, but no one ventured
to try to stop the 1200 pound
animal.

“They claim she tore up
fence and everything, but she
never caused any trouble here.”

Cooke went on to explain that
the more the animals are han-
died, the tamer they become.
“The buffalo will come into the

barn just-like a cow will.”

All of his varied species get
along well together on the 80
acre farm, but the horned an-
imals will attack each other if
they are stabled together.

Cooke was once hauling a
wild bull through downtown
Memphis and the bull became
restless because of his small
enclosure and the unfamiliar
surroundings. ‘Scared people to
death,” Cooke said.

His neighbors are tolerant to-
ward Cooke's hobby, but they
aren't overly enthusiastic. Chil-
dren enjoy the docile animals
immensely, however, and school
groups regularly view the exo-
tic herd.

Davidson students and any-
one else driving Highway 21 to
Charlotte can expect to see the
animals every time they drive
by. Cooke sees no termination
of his “business”: he enjoys
watching and raising them, and
they seem to be perfectly con-
tent with their present home
and company.

Night Attack On Coed Sparks

Discussion Of CampusSecurity

AN ANALYSIS

While a resourceful scream
by the coed limited the encount-

Nursing Program Initiated

By TOM AINSWORTH
Staff Writer
Davidson, in cooperation with
Presbyterian Hospital of Char-
lotte, has started a Male Nurs-

ing Assistant Program.

The program, in operaticn
since last term, was begun by
the request of the hospital,
which was in need of help, par-
ticularly male nursing assist-
ants who do orderly type work,
and to also provide Davidson
students with a unique work-
ing experience, especially those
enrolled in a pre-med program.

The program is not, however,
restricted only to science stu-
dents, according to Donald L.
Kimel, associate biology pro-
fessor and the projeot’s coordi-
nator. Anyone interested in
working in a hospital environ-
ment may use the MNA pro-
gram as an extended studies
credit, although the participants
should be either iuniors or sen-
iors.

The initial part of the course
is an extensive training  pro-
gram of talks accompanied by

films, taking up 30 hours of
classroom time over a two week
period. The MNAs are then as-
signed different areas of the
hospital in which to work, be-
ing under the guidance of the
nurses there.

The program is far from per-
fect, though, as evidenced by
some of the comments received
by those involved.

One of them, Rob Krebs,
thinks the project has ‘good
possibilities” but ‘‘what Pres-
byterian essentially wants is
just male nursing assistants.
What we're looking for is see-
ing different cases, diagnoses,
and contact with physicians.”

The training program’ he
adds is ‘“‘geared for a sixth
grade level of intelligence” and
that a “‘lot of time is wasted.”

This seems to be the con-
sensus of opinicn in regard to
a survey conducted by Dave
Grissett among the .eight other
members of the program be-
sides himself. who participated
during the fall term.

They all thought the training

program could have covered
the same amount of material
in one week, and that most of
the films were ineffectual. More
demonstrations could be used in
the future they thought, and
some even admitted that they
actually learned more once
they started their work.

lanes between buildings. while
a large number of male stu-
dents have discussed the pos-
sibility of increasing the rela-
tively miniscule force of secur-
ity officers.

Such measures aren't so easi-

a position which als» makes
him head of campus security.

“Every year we embark on
a campaign to get more lighting
on campus, lighting «areas of
the cainpus in order of need.”
Meetze said. “We simpiy don't
have money in the budget «vail
able at this moment to add any
mere lighting immediately, and
besides, many of the boys don't
want more lighting.”

Meetze pointed out that the
Davidson student. used to the
all-male atmosphere of the stu-
dent body, has not yet realized
all the implications involved
when female students are add-
ed.

One of these’ implications
would be the necessity of ad-
ditional lighting for safety, for
women would make the evening
life at Davidson much more at-
tractive to men both on and
off campus. In essence, a coed

campus is much more suscep-
tible to sexual attacks.

Speaking to the question of
the size of the security staff,
Meetz said that ‘‘as far as ad-
ditional security goes, we're try
ing to improve the security situ
action.”’

There are no immediate plans
for making additions to the
staff, Meetze said.

Meetze said that the problam
of girls and the off campus lo-
cation of the women’s dorm has
made security more. difficult.
“We have had cooperation from
the local police. but to make
the security situation more ideal
for the girls people are going
to have to start reporting every-
thing that might cause security
problems on campus."

and condition

survival.
