IN PREPARING FEXAMS.

Students, especially the new men, are
often puzzled to know how to prepare
for examinations. Dr. Sentelle makes
the following general suggestions:

Cover the whole subject. Go over it
all to refresh the details in the mind.
Spotting is unsafe. If dailys and reviews
have been studied this will not be cram-
ming, but refreshing the memory.

Utilize all the time of examinations.
Do not wait till just before time for it to
study and come in fifteen minutes late.
Study hard the days before,

Go on the examination fresh and with
a clear brain. Do not stay up too late
the night before, or study at all the
merning of the examination.

Get a plenty of sleep and take plenty
of exercise. Work hard the rest of the
time.

fire is kept going all the time.

Each and every man in the student
body is cordially invited to make yse of

It is ta be hoped that each man in the
student body will enter heartily into the
spirit that made it possible for us to have
this center for our campus life, and se
make it a great force ta knit the men of
Davidson College more closely together.
