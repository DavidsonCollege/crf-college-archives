“Davey Spencer, the Barium Springs busy little man
who must be considered for anybody’s All-State team,
ran all afternoon like a puppet on strings, jerked away
from tacklers time and again to furnish the running thrills
and ran across three touchdowns.” :

All-State;

Spencer will prebably not make indeed, the
odds are very much. aga nst it. Lack of publicity and the
fact that Da xn do not play hith-rressure football

been heard recently of the formation of

a conference of “sma'ler schools.” To those of us who don’t
mind beine blant, th’s means a, conference made up of
schools who vive little or no aid to athletes. So far the
i’aa has reached no more than a suggestive stage,
Questioned ) at | \ d thisk of such a
conference, Dr. ¥ Ling? t ’ ‘As far
s ’m: concerned, La n fac f s of sme phy-
cal. and dercic Ine formine a conference.” Dr.
Nincle p {cut at th ime time that nothine tane ble
hadN rovh rth and that had piven the matter
no grert thou tht.

Personally, we would hate to" see Davidson withdraw
from the Southern Conference. No one can help admit that

Davidson football teams of the last. few years have been
in the lower strata of the conferences However, in other
sports it has be en a different story. The Wildcat cagers of
year before last reached the semifinals ofthe Tourney.
This is but one example of Wildcat accomplishments in
other fields.
