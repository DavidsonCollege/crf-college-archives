Stewart and Spears Lead Men's Track at Emory Classic
For the Women, The Injuries Keep Piling Up as the Season Progresses

By Peter Hurtado

Men's Track

Themen’s track and field team
displayed some, depth this past
Saturday as-they gear up for the
Southern Conference Meetin May.
With some nice weather for a
change, the ‘Cats managed a tenth
place finish out of 24 teams at the
Emory Classic in Atlanta.

Perhaps the finest effort of the
meet was Senior Ian Stewart’s out-
standing 10,000m time of 32:03,
placing second. Stewart’s stellar
effort ranks him third ever at
Davidson, and will place him
among the Southern Conference’s
elite. :

Senior Dave Kerns was just
behind Stewart at 32:29 (fifth) with
an outstanding effort of his own.

Duncan Spears clocked another
lightning-fast 400m hurdle time of
55.3, placing third. Spears is ranked
second in the Conference. Lee
Sutton regained his form in the
shot put, throwing 44’ 1" to place
third. Lee should certainly chal-
lenge for the top spots in the con-
ference.

In the hammer, Rob King’s
hurl of 116' 2" was good enough
for fourth overall. Freshman Bo
Bartholomew, in his third sport
here at Davidson, made the mark
in the discus at 112' 6".

In the middle distance corps,
Pete Hurtado (4:06) clocked a fine
1500m, while Joe Beach (2:02)
paced the 800m. The men ended
the meet with a flourish, placing
seventh overall with the fastest

4x400m relay time (3:28.8) re- —

corded at Davidson in several years.
The men were led by Spears’ 50.9
split.

Coach Gary Andrew was
pleased at the men’s showing in
Atlanta. The team gears up for the
Conference Meet next weekend at
the Duke Invitational. After the
Duke and Gamecock Invitationals,
Davidson will travel to App. St. for
the Southern Conference Champi-
onships.

Women's Track

The women’s track and field
team continued it’s spring cam-
paign with a-solid effort at the
Emory Classic in Atlanta this past
Saturday. The Lady Wildcats
fought hard and finished the week-
end fourteenth out of 22 teams.

Perhaps the finest effort of the
afternoon was Karen Marshall’s
outstanding 3000m run of 10:45 to
place fifth. Marshall can expect to
place at the Conference meet ei-
ther in the 3000m or in the 1500m,
where she ran a 4:52 earlier this
season.

Heather Tarpley placed third
in the discus, and remained atop
the Conference rankings in the
400m hurdles at 67.1. Maria
Whitehead’s triple jump was good
enough for fourth overall, while
she continued her improvement in
the 400m hurdles, placing sixth at
69.4. Carolyn Meadows recorded
a fine 3000m time of 11:12, while
Hellisse Hoffman ran strong times
in the 200m and 400m runs. Inju-

ies have hit the ‘Cats hard this

season, but there is not much time
torest before the Southern Confer-
ence Championships. Phuong
Nguyen and Laura Jordan appear
healthy and in good shape with
strong efforts in the 1500m, while
Jean DeMossand Jenn Brown con-
tinued their recovery in the 800m.
Elizabeth Bishop’s knee in-
jury has hampered her stellar sea-
.son in which she has already bro-
ken the school record in the
10,000m run at 38:58. Injury has
also slowed a fine season for fresh-
man Marie Grisez. Coach Beth
Manson hopes that her women will
recover from these injuries in time
to score points at the Conference
Meet in May. The women travel to
the Duke Invitational next week-
end.

5K Fun Run Brings Joy
and Health to Participants

By Mike Peters &
Kelly Davis

The first ever Spring Frolics
Fun Run/Walk was a screaming
success. The fifty students, fac-
ulty, and alumni that braved health
physical activity during a weekend
of gluttony and hedonism were
well rewarded.

The 5K course took the par-
ticipants from Richardson Hall,
around Patterson Court, to thecross
country trails and ended behind
the Commons. Bob Maydole
humbled the overfed leaders of
tomorrow with a runaway time of
18:11. Amy Hoffheimer, the top
women’s runner, hardly broke a
sweat as she finished in 21:59.
Runners were divided into four
categories and prizes were awarded
for the top four finishers in each
classification.

The top finishers-in-the fac-
ulty/staff category were Bob

Maydole, Mike Peters ’91 (19:30), —

Tom Kazee (20:28), and John Heil
(20:42). The top finishers in the
student male division were Mark
Wittschen (20:11), David
Christopherson (20:14), Corey
Bean (20:21), Matt Spears (21:59),
and Arthur Gaston (22:23). Win-
ners in the student women cat-

egory were Amy Hoffheimer, Su- _

san Wallace (22:57), Christy Lee
(23:57), and Erin Lee (24:21).

Sally McMillen, top finisher
in the women’s faculty category,
Ann Todd, Chad McCall, and
Nathan Fenwick deserve special
recognition for their over-zealous
jauntafter missing the well-marked
turn-around point.

Everyone else finished with

various times that do not really || .

matter; we’re just glad they made
it. Fun was had by all. We look
forward toeven more participation
next year!
