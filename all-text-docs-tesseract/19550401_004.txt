Political Open Season

Politics is politics, and politics, be it
ever so Presbyterian, has blown in with
the spring thaw to heat up the talking
apparatus of most wheels, spokes, cogs
and rims in Davidson.

As this edition goes to press specula-
tion runs high as to whom the students
will choose as President of the Student
Government for next year. The greatest
part of elections lies ahead, however, so
a few healthy reminders to keep their
feet on the ground, not to be blown about
like a reed in every little wind. might be
given to students.

Walter Lippmann has pictured a
politician (in A Preface to Morals, p. 281)
as one who says “I will give you what you
want,” and a statesman as one who says
“What you think you want is this. What
it is possible for you to get is that. What
you really want, therefore, is the follow-
ing.” It would be wise if students in-
dividually and as a group took it upon
themselves when they vote to ask one
question: Is this man the best at blarney
and the most popular, or is he the man
who can do the job? We need to choose
the men who can move us forward with
the least friction, not cause the greatest
explosion for no purpose but to be heard.

Outhouses, Hothouses,
Or Frat Houses

We are reminded of the habit on the
part of vociferous members of the stu-
dent body to rummage automatically in
old trash piles of consciousness and bring
the “College” to task for opposing the
social fraternities. Two years ago, for
instance, many had the idea that the ad-
ministration, in providing for Union eat-
ing for freshmen, was “out to destroy
the last bit of student sovereignty, the
fraternity.” Heat considerably outdid light
in the controversy, students saying that
once the administration had its way the
fraternity houses would be nothing more
than “the outhouses of the Union.”

It would be interesting to find upon
exactly what grounds the students
find the fraternities the most important
part of college life. They are made up of
groups of students who eat together and
meet once weekly, and they elect mem-
bers to an organization known as the IFC
which chooses big name bands for dance
weekends. They make a lot of fuss when
they’ have hell week, and twice yearly
they have their own private balls all over
the countryside. Some members of all of
them play intramural sports, and when
they do something unusual they tell na-
tional headquarters about it. Beyond this,
Davidson fraternities don’t seem to be
fraternities at all, if one would define
fraternity as a group of men united
under a common ideal and working to-
ward a common goal.

Maybe the fraternities should ask
themselves some questions about what
use they serve to forward the College and
education, since they are accusative in
speaking of College designs against them.
What fraternities, for instance, have
taken an active part in sponsoring events
which the College brings to campus? Have
any of the groups ever approached the ad-
ministration to offer their sponsorship in
publicizing an artist series feature as
S&B, ODK and the IFC have sponsored
blood drives in the past? At least one
fraternity was proud of itself for some
“Greek Week” work amidst all the hell
week noise in March, but has any group
undertaken a project as a fraternity
instead of as a group of impressed fresh-

men? How many fraternities worked as
groups to publicize and support the
U.C.M.?

Sometimes we wonder if many people
haven’t got things just backward around
here, complaining about things which
they themselves could alleviate with a
little effort. Couldn’t a lot of student
apathy be eliminated if those students
who are joined in the eleven brotherhoods
united as groups to support the activities
of the’ College. There can be little doubt
that in return the College would both
support and treat the fraternities as
active organizations vital to its life.

A clear sign of progress was the pro-
duction of “Good News” in co-sponsor-
ship between the Alpha Tau Omega Fra-
ternity and the College Y.M.C.A. last
December, to supply finances for the
Christmas Gift Fund. Such activities as
this on the part of the social fraternities
could well convince pragmatic thinkers
that they have a place on campus, and
are not just outdated pieces of floating
tradition like their forefathers, the lit-
erary societies.

New Y, Same Chapel

The all new YMCA Constitution has |

passed by a stupendous vote which shows,
among other things, that the word “volun-
tary” still means a lot to a Student Body
in which the word involuntary has been
so thoroughly impregnated with regard
to religious exercises.

It is unfortunate, we feel, that the
students had jurisdiction over their mem-
bership in the Y, which has been one of
the most active organizations for their
benefit, while they have not had the
slightest chance to be heard in like man-
ner regarding chapel, which is of ques-
tionable spiritual worth, and which is
such a sore spot that we seldom hear of
a week gone by without some committee
trying to form a sensible solution to “un-
exemplary student conduct.”

Now that it’s over, the Y will have to
get out and dig in the fall, but we are
afraid it will have about as much trouble
drumming up business as a fish monger
on the super-market block.

Traditionally

Irreligious

Speaking of chapel, we heard one of
our faculty friends défending it vehement-
ly recently. Said he, chapel is absolutely
necessary, because it is all that makes
Davidson Davidson, the only great tradi-
tion left which ties the students to each
other and to the college. Hence, it must
be maintained.

We feel not only that his thesis was,
to speak softly, questionable, but far more
important than this, that he has left
religion, the reason our forefathers
instituted chapel, completely out of the
picture. So far as we can tell, without its
teligious function, chapel is utterly unde-
fensible, and it is up to the committee in
charge of it not to try to keep the noise
down, but to see if it has a basic purpose
any longer which by any imaginative
stretch can be called fulfilled. Somehow
we're skeptical.

Small Denominational

Fadeout?

An editorial in the March 23 issue
of Christian Century throws interesting
light on Dr. Cunningham's recent chapel
talk summarizing the astonishing growth
in college population before 1970 (2% to
5 million) and Davidson’s part in that
growth. Says the Century, to fill the rising
need “hundreds of two-and four-year co)-
leges, built and financed through local
and state governments, will be necessary
if higher education is to meet the de-
mands made upon it.”

If Davidson’s philosophy that small
schools are best and that denominational
schools provide the best character in the
graduate by giving him church relation-
ship throughout his college career, then
Davidson should either begin to revise
her definition of the word “small” or let
the state schools have all but the richest
cream of Presbyterian youth. After all,
Scots multiply mickle like everybody else.

make certain that it is not the conscience

As The Administration Sees Athletic Subsidization

The Overall
Picture

By OR, JOHN R. CUNNINGHAM

1 have accepted the invitation of
O.D.K. to state my convictions
about subsidized football at David-
son College, It seems altogether in
order that such a statement should
be made to the students who are
the ones most concerned. Certainly
all of the students should know
the score. The best interests of
the entire student body are to be
considered in this connection.

When we face the problem of
football at Davidson nobody is
satisfied. The Alumni, the Trus-
tees, the Faculty, the Students,
and our friends could all wish that
it might be more satisfactorily
handled. We must be frank and
factual about the problem as it
confronts us. We have dreamed
about the good old days and hoped
they could come again. We have
failed to recognize what has been
happening to football in the col-
leges of the country generally and
among our own competitors and
within our own institution.

OUR PAST RECORD

It is not fair. to a student body
or to the morale of an institution
to place it in a
position where
it must almost
constantly be on
the losing side
of the ledger. 1

have checked
~ .~ back on David.
. son's football

“record from

1920. I find that
there are only nine years in
the thirty-four seasons in which
we have won more games than we
have lost. Three of those years
were in the twenties, four were in
the thirties, one was in the forties,
and one in this decade—last year.
It should be added that in o num-
ber of those years we tied one or
more games. At only one period
since 1920 have we seemed to win
with some consistency, and that
was in the year 1924, 1925, and
1926; and these were in the years
before subsidization had come on
the scene.

In stating my conviction about
subsidized football, I believe my
position is in the main that of my
associates in the Admiristration
and in the Faculty. Let me make
it abundantly clear that these
statements are without personal
implications and in no sense re-
flect upon our splendid staff of
football coaches and the fine body
of students who are receiving ath-
letic scholarships. Up to the
present time this has been a recog-
nized policy of the College, and
those operating within that frame-
work are completely in the clear.

Davidson College is continuing
to discuss a problem which has
been settled by many of her sister
institutions of like rank and size
ten to twenty years ago. It is the
question of subsidizing football.
Increasingly Davidson is finding
herself bereft of competition with
congenial and like sized colleges be-
cause of the number of such insti-
tutions which have in years past
given up subsidized athletics and
are unwilling to play colleges
which are subsidized. I have
reference to such institutions in
the South as Emory, Sewanee,
Centre, Southwesfern, Hampden:
Sydney, and more recently Wash-
intgon and Lee.

AMATEUR SPORTS

A decade or more ogo many
small liberal arts colleges in New
England and in the Midwest—such
institutions as Swarthmore, Johns
Hopkins, Amherst, Williams, Han-
over, Wooster, Carleton, Coe, West-
minster, and others—saw the hand-
writing on the wall, and moved to
amateur sports. Under this arrange-
ment they seem quite convinced
and satisfied. Naturally they do
not look with any favor upon play-
ing institutions which are in effect
buying their teams. More recently
between twenty and thirty of the
large institutions which were play-
ing “big-time” football and paying
for it have given it up, assigning
as their chief reason their inability
to afford the financial outlay in-
volved.

Meanwhile, Davidson has been
placed in the anomalous position
of having to undertake a type of
schedule which involved the cx-
tremes between Georgia Tech on
the one hand and Elon and Cataw-
ba and other like institutions on
the other. It is only within recent
years that we have found it neces-
sary to forego playing our former
rivals, Duke, Carolina, Army, and
other such institutions. The win-
ning season of last year for David-
son was, as I see it, only partly
related to increased subsidizing
and very largely attributable to the

Cunningham

fact that we did not play Georgia
Tech, Harvard, and North Caro-
lina State. Had we done so as we
did the year before, it would sure-
ly have been another disastrous
year of losses.

Our present program would
seem to be a desperate struggle
to carry on as we have done in
the past and a failure to recognize
what has been happening all about
us both in actual practice and in
educational opinion. Davidson has
never subsidized so heavily as at
the present time. Meanwhile, her
record has not often been more
unsatisfactory. In 1948, we sub-
sidized to the extent of $8,000 for
football. In 1054, it was $30,000.
As I see it, Davidson’s best years
in the sport were years when sub-
sidizing was almost unknown. Da-
vidson men seem always to have
‘played their best game when they
were playing purely for the love
of the sport and through loyalty
to the institution.

FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIPS

We have now moved to where
practically the entire team is sub-
sidized. Last year there were
forty-three students on football
scholarships totaling $30,000. The
average athletic scholarship last
year was $688 apiece. This means
that a considerable number of
players were receiving their entire
college expenses for four years
while otfiers were receiving smaller
amounts. :

While considering the financial
situation, let it be noted that while
spending $30,000 provided as
designated scholarships by the
Alumni, the College provided in
addition the salaries, travel costs,
uniforms, training table, and other
expenses amounting up to. $32,000
more than the income from gate
receipts and guarantees.

UNFAIR EXPENDITURE

I submit that such an expendi-
ture on one sport is hardly fair to
the other sports, to the predomi-
nant number of students who are
not in any of these sports, or to
the other departments of the Col-
lege. An important administrative
survey made of Davidson College
in 1952 by a highly skilled firm of
management engineers stated, “Net
expenses incurred for intercol-
legiate football amounted to 557%
of the total athletic and physi-
cal education expense although
fifty-nine students, or less than
8% of the student body, attained
intercollegiate squad status dur-
1951-52."

In recent years Davidson has
been spending more money on in-
tercollegiate footba}l than on any
one of the following: (1) the Col-
lege Library, Staff, books, and
maintenance, (2) Its entire Re-
ligious Program, (3) All other
sports put together, (4) The entire
Music Department, (5) Any other
Single Department in the institu-
tion, (6) Than the entire annual
gifts of the churches through
benevolent channels.

The Faculty has repeatedly tak-
en action indicating its belief in
intercollegiate footbal] as a sport.
There is no position on the part of
any in the Administration or

Letters to the Editor:

Faculty to discriminate against this
sport which has meant a great deal
to individual students and to the
College. It is believed that ama-
teur football. is enjoyed quite as
much by the students and creates
a morale and spirit which heavily
subsidized football with its com-
mercial aspects cannot create.

JOINT COMMITTEE REPORT

It is with many of these and
other considerations in mind that
a joint committee of five Faculty
members and five Trustees, after
working long and hard at our en-
tire setup a year ago this spring,
came forward with the following
recommendation to the Trustees
for the establishment of a policy.
This was their recommendation
which was fully discussed and
unanimously adopted by the Trus-
tee:s

“We recommend to the
Trustees that they authorize
the President of the College to
solicit and encovrage «
selected group of at least six
colleges and universities to
loin with us in promoting «
program looking toward the
eholishing of subsidized ath-
lotics (that is, athletic scholer-
ships es such} at the earliest
possible date. in order that
the President of the College
may understand the degree of
authority given him under this
recommendation, we would
agree that the principles
adopted by the ivy Group in-
dicate the general type of
agreement to be desired.”

OUR PECULIAR PROBLEMS

Note the problem which David-
son’s general position creates for
a football coach. He starts with
unyielding academic standards for
admission. Nobody questions this
requirement, and Coach Dole has
been very conscientious and con-
siderate of it. The number of foot-
ball men available for Davidson
College on this condition is there-
by considerably decreased. In the
next place, we are a small college
in a small village where the spec-
tator interest is greatly decreased
in light of easy transportation and
television. Furthermore, the ideal
of Davidson College for providing
an adequate physical training for
every student in attendance mili-
tates against over emphasis on any
one sport. There are few colleges
in this section of America under-
taking so broad a program of
physical education, intramural
sports, and intercollegiate sports.

- There are few, if any, colleges

better equipped or staffed for this
kind of program.

In light of these considerations
and many others which could be
presented, I am fully convinced,
and I believe the Faculty of the
College together with many of its
Trustees and Alumni are too, that
our wisest procedure is the work-
ing out of a schedule for inter.
collegiate football with institutions
which are willing to join us on
the basis of the Trustee’s resolu.
tion of May, 1954.

E. M. Starr Attacks Davidsonian;
Threatens To Sue For Libel

Dear Editor:

As my son, Wilson, was too busy
to write due to studying and read-
ing in the faint shadow of Wood-
row Wilson, at the library, I sub-
scribed to the Davidsonten in hopes
of getting some news. I never re-
ceive my copy until two weeks
after publication. You can’t blame
this on the faculty, or can you?
Your circulation manager is prob-
ably a Tar-heel Davidson brain-
washed senior. You should appoint
a Yankee freshman if possible, if
you want service.

My copy of February 25 has been
held up indefinitely because of a
very degrading, slanderous and
libelous article which assassinates
the fine character of my son. The
truth is stretched and implications
made that will permanently injure
the good name and future success
of said Wilson C. Starr.

Take notice of the outstretched
hand with wine glass super-im-
posed which reminds me of the
McCarthy episode, done to impli-
eate an innocent person. Who
would dream there were Roy Cohns
at dear old Davidson!

In order to protect the good
name of my son, who is a descen-
dant of one of the founders of
Harvord College, I am forced to
bring suit for partial damage of
one million’ ($1,000,000) dollars.
Such a headline should give your
paper temporary reprieve from the
waste baskets. You could hold up

delivery of papers (as you have
mine) and might even sell them to
the faculty. .

After receiving judgment I will
then decide which I prefer—the
Church or the Gymnasium. Prob-
ably the gym as then I would have
the concession to furnish all gym
suits and supporters and then 1!
would have them by the—throat,
and perhaps would receive an
order for athletic equipment. Being
a foreigner (anyone not {rém
North Carolina) that would be fan-
tastic.

Of course, I may have to give in
to my wife as usual, she being from
old Virginia—loves antiques. She
would prefer one of the DORMS,
but would insist on including care-
taker with feather duster for Da-
vidson atmosphere.

My son is the FIRST to be domi-
ciled in a furnished home in the
exclusive suburb of Cornelius. Per-
haps he will be the FIRST to re-
ceive a scholarship during the last
semester of his senior year. The
schoo] might prefer to call it a
Fellowship at Duke School of
Medicine.

So there you are,

E. M. STARR.

P.S.—Since interviewing many
of the future Rhodes scholars, sur-
geons and business tycoons in your
school I find that Davidsenian
could not be held guilty of with.
holding “news” regardless of time
of delivery.

The Financial
Side

By D. GRIER MARTIN

There was oa time, before the
doys of television, “big time” foot-
ball, and rapid transportation.
when colleges lke Davidson sup-
ported their entire athletic pro
grams with the income received
from football games. These were
the days when eight or ten thou-
sand people came fairly regularly
to Richardson Field to watch the
Wildcats play, requiring the erec-
tion each fall of bleachers along
the sides next to the stadium and
also in both end zones!

The extent of the change is in-
dicated by the fact that Davidson's
1984 football team, the best in
many years, drew only 8,403 spec-
tators for the five home games at
Davidson and the result was in-
come barely sufficient to pay the
actual game expenses (travel, of-
ficials, ticket sellers, etc.) with
nothing left to meet all the other
football expenses of equipment,
coaches, movies, scouting, travel,
publicity, maintenance, and many
others.

BIG LEAGUE COMPETITION

This is a condition which is by
no means peculiar to Davidson
College. In fact, it is fairly typi-
cal of those institutions which are
similar in size and type of pro-
gram. And the worst part of it is
that the situation may get worse
instead of better. Robert Ball
former Athletic Director at Yale,
writing in the January 10th issue

of Sports Uitustrated stated that -

“college football as it is played,
every Saturday in the fall by over
400 teams throughout the country
is in grave danger today.” He be-
lieves that the football programs
of these colleges will be virtually
ruined unless the NCAA controlled
system of telecasting football
games is continued. Since he wrote
that article there has been some
indication that the system will net
be continued in the same degree
and many interpret this as the
beginning of the end of any real
control.

Perhaps a few figures on this
year’s athletic budget of income
and expense may help to make the
picture clearer:
Football

Gate Receipts $23,104
Footbal)

Game Expenses $20,330

Otber

Football Expenses 35,213 65,643

Net Loss, Football 32,379

(Other Football Expenses in-
cludes uniforms, equipment,

proportion of coaches’ salaries,
early practice, | travel, film,
scouting, training supplies,
Aelephone, etc.

SCHOLARSHIPS

The expense of athletic scholar-
ships has not been included in the
expenses listed above. Approxi-
mately $30,000 in football scholar.
ships and $2,800 in basketball were
awarded for this year. These grants
were made possible by the
designated Alumni Fund gifts for
Wildcat Club athletic scholarships.
Last yeor athletic scholarships
totalled $31,600 of which the Wild-
cat Club raised $26,600, the re-
mainder being supplied from the
regular college budget.

The college has made 2 commit-
ment for a program of not more
than $35,000 in athletic scholar.
ships for 1955-56 and this has been
guaranteed by the Wildcat Club.

What would be the financial ef.
fect of a discontinuance of sub-
sidized athletic scholarships at Da.
vidson? This is a difficult if not
impossible question to answer.
Much would depend on the insti.
tuition with whom Davidson would
compete. If these institutions pro-
vide rivalries which are already
“natural” ones or if they can be
developed into “natural” rivalries
it is believed by many that a great
deal of interest would result from
such competition.

MUST MAINTAIN STANDARDS

in the matter of expenses there
would undoubtedly be considera-
ble saving in a number of different
ways. Teams which are now com.
peting on a non-subsidized basis
do not spend nearly as much on
such items as scouting, uniforms,
equipment, films, telephone, re-
cruiting, and similar things. On the
other hand, many of the expenses
will not change too much. David-
son would not want on an amateur
basis to provide any less skillful
coaching, poor equipment, inade-
quate facilities, or any other sub-
standard items which would make
the game less valuable in its con-
tribution to the participant or less
interesting to the spectator.

The elimination of contributions
to the Wildcat Club  athictic
scholarship program would prob-
ably result in increased alumni
support of other phases of the col-
lege’s program, including increased
giving for scholarships for all types
of students. It is doubtful whether
such a change would result in the
transfer of all giving for athletic
scholarships to other purposes.
since some alumni are interested
only in the athletic program of
the College, but the vast majority
of the alumni are interested in the

whele college program.

RACKS

IN THE

LOISTER

By LEIGHTON MeCUTCHEN

A Primer For Candidates--
Davidson Style

Ah spring! And the sap is rising
all over the campus, producing
blooms and fruits, especially in the
area of politics. If you are a hope-
ful, then this primer is for you.

“OUR” WAY

You see here at Davidson we
don't believe in campsigning or
voting on issues per se, or in
arguing with each other about
who or what is sensible for a par-
ticular office. That sort of open
politics is naughty you know.
Under such a system, people have
to think about a platform, and are
forced to sell their ideas. Of course
this leads to pain and friction.

Such a plan would assume that
there are issues dividing us as 2
college family (ugly thought)
which are worthwhile enough to
be fought over. And again, only
“gung-ho’s” get excited enough to
campaign, and who likes those
kind. So you can see that our way
is much better.

And moreover—we de vote on
issues now. Of course we gain
knowledge of them through hear-
say only since the paper, public de-
bate, systematic presentation and
rebuttle—all are banned by the
Holy Constitution. But the issues
are there. Things like, is the can-
didate sincere—ie., is he nice,
does he know other names besides
mine, does he fit in with the
“boys.”

Another issue concerns whether
or not the candidate has some

talent for leading. You know that
means does he not take things
too seriously, and does he lead
from the back row rather than
from way out in front (we don't
trust this kind).

Of course the candidate must be-
Neve in this third issue. Can he
do the job better than its been donc
before. If he does, that is all he
needs to say for election, for we
will trust him at his word, and
then forget about him in his office
next year.

FOOLISH BOY

Don’t be misled into thinking
that there is a better way to run
an election. Don’t try to run on
issues like that of promoting Ne-
gro enrollment, liberalizing of the
constitution to provide a thought-
ful student body with a real voice,
or of putting more money on
scholarships for boys that really
need them.

Don’t pass the word around that
you have a particular view on hel!
week activities, or on athletic sub-
sidization, or on the drinking ques-
tion, or improvements in the cur-
riculum of the college.

Your voters won't like you if you
do this. We want personalities in
office, not fellows bound to do a
job promised. It’s the Davidson
Way, and. it’s pretty near perfect.
So walk in it, candidate, if you
want to win. .

(Sour grapes? Let’s hope not en-
tirely.)
