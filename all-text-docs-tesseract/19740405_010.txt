To Enter Elimination

By TRACY CHARLES
Staff Writer

Davidson qualified for the
South Atlantic Intercollegiate
Sailing Association (SAISA)
Spring Championships this
year by placing second over-all
in a close match for the top
three places at Old Dominion
University last weekend.

While the first division was
sailing their eliminations at
Old Dominion, College of
Charleston and The Citadel

were hosting a _ joint
eliminations regatta for
SAISA's other division.

Due to increased mem-
bership in the past few years,
SAISA has found it expedient
to divide the conference along
geographical lines into two
sections. Each section will
send their top three schools to
the championships, being held
at Duke on April 23.

Duke, Davidson and Univer-
sity of Virginia will attend
from one division, and,
although the results of the
College of Charleston/Citadel
regatta have not yet been con-
firmed, it is likely that College
of Charleston, The Citadel and
Clemson will represent the
other division.

The regatta last weekend
was what could only be
described as typically Old
Dominion. Cloudy and cold
with periodical rain and
ominous rumblings from the
north, the races were run from
10 to 5 Saturday afternoon in
the Elizabeth River.

Daryl Douglas and crew
Tracy Charles sailed in the A

i

overpower the 12-foot dingies.
The A Division was called in
after their fourth race.

While the Race Committee
waited for the front to pass
through, one broken cen-
terboard and two split masts
were repaired.

A two hour ent
brought more stable con-
ditions and the B Division
began their four race series.

Dave Francis and crew
Tommy Lee sailed for David-
son's B Division. Francis
pulledin twoseconds, onethird
and one fourth, duplicating
Douglas’ earlier performance.

Frequent equipment
malfunctions related to the
heavy abuse the boats had
weathered earlier in the
squalls made efficient sailing
difficult for the ‘‘B’’ skippers.

Douglas and Francis were
not enthusiastic about their in-
dividual performances, but
Davidson's invitation to the
Championships, the primary
concern of the day, made
sailing all day in the cold rain
worthwhile.

The sailing team will travel
to Duke this weekend for their
Annual Spring Regatta. This
will provide a good op-
portunity for Davidson to
practice in and become ac-
customed to Windmills, the
boats that will be used in the
Championships.

By DONNA NEUDORFER
Staff Writer

The annual spring rite of
feverish interest in tennis has
been heightened even further
due to the organization of a
junior varsity tennis team.

The addition of the JV’s to
the women’s and men’s var-
sity teams makes finding a
place to play even harder for

Catawba, Bulldogs
In Triangular Meet

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Last week, Davidson's track
team gave coach Sterling
Martin his first track victory
since taking over as head
coach. The victory came at
last at a triangular meet

i Catawba and Gard-
ner Webb at Gardner Webb on
March 26,

Davidson won. easily,
scoring 85 points to Catawba's
55 and GW’s 41. Davidson had
lost an earlier’ meet to Ap-
palachian 125-38.

The team’s leading scorer at
this point of the season is
Mark Connors, who won the
100 and the 220 in the
triangular meet and the 440
against the Apps

Bob Lautensack also was a
double winner at GW, winning
both the 880 and the mile.
Against Appalachian he
placed second in _ the

steeplechase.

Woody Van Meter has only
taken five jumps in the pole
vault but has won twice. Greg
Love won the high hurdles in
both meets.

Steve Shankweiler had a
double against the tough Apps
in the shot and the discus.

Other winners for the Cat

meet were Rick Mullin(440),
aa Paul(long jump), Tom

Case (triple jump), and the
mile relay team.

Case and Paul both got
seconds in their events at Ap-
The Cats’ next meet is at
Catawba today. Next week
will take them to VMI and
then they will host the David-

son Relays next Saturday.

The Relays will be held at
Myers Park this year because
of the construction of the new
Davidson track. Martin hopes
that it will be ready for at least
one home meet this year, but
April 20 is the last, and the
recent rains have slowed work
considerably.

Martin is looking for a good
season. Ricky Bell, last year’s
Most Valuable Player, and
freshman Walter Crouch
should be returning from in-
juries soon.

There are a few school
records that are in jeopardy
this year. Freshman Coty Pin-
ckney came within 13 seconds
of seizing Martin's record for
the three mile in the

triangular meet.
Other possibilities include
Lautensack in the

steeplechase, Bell in the mile,
and Van Meter to break his

really in favor of the
idea, and it’s working out
really well this year,”’ varsii

tennis coach Jeff Frank said.
“It gives more kids a chance
to play every day and to work
on their games. This way I get
atthe guys that can help
at

junior varsity teams right
now, and they don’t seem to
want their varsities losing to
our JV’s.

In addition to allowing more
students to participate in com-
petitive tennis, the JV
program is being designed to
help in recruiting of good high
school players. swe d like to
build up a schedule with lots of
real good high school teams,”’
Earpsaid.

“This year we have Landon
and Charlotte Latin School,
but I think next year we'll
probably add East Mecklen-

burg and Myers Park to our
schedule. By inviting high
school teams to our campus,
we hope to cultivate some in-
terest in Davidson. Our
facilities are one of the great
assets of the tennis program
here,”’
