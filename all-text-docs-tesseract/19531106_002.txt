Diploma: Old or New?

Since 1980 each successive class as it rounded the corner
to the senior year has been faced with the question as to the
advisability of a change from the diploma which is now being
used back to the original 1840 diploma.

It is true that some may say, “I don’t care what kind of
a diploma I get as long as I get one.” But does this kind of
lackadaiscal reasoning actually reflect the general attitude of
the Davidson student? This question can only be answered
by the student himself.

In order to provide a background for a reasonable dis-
cussion of the diplomas, it is necessary to understand what
the proposals are and why a change has been considered for
the last few years. The diploma which the college has used
since 1929 is a compromise between the traditional and the
modern type of diploma. It is 13% x 16% inches in size and
is engraved in block Latin on sheepskin. ba is “, adequate « a

mame and other areas of the
diploma.

If the present diploma is sup-
posed to be a modernization, it is
difficult to understand. The size
and the lettering of the original
was changed but the Latin lan.
guage was retained. A good case
can be made for the modern trade-
school diploma—all in English, no
sentiment, no aesthetic appeal—
but hardly for a sehool like Da
vidson.

No case can be made for the
hybrid product presented to us in
1630. It is neither traditional nor
modern but the illegitimate aff.
spring of two oddly matched
parents.

WHY A DIPLOMA?

For some institutions, a letter
from the President, a button (va
riations on the ruptured duck, per-
haps), or a stamp on the wrist
would serve the purposes of a di-
ploma. For these, all that is wanted
is a visible, negotiable sign of

At Davidson we pride ourselves
on a way of life that is rooted
in the best from past generations
of collegians—a past that has pro-
duced a living honor system, a re-
spect for our heritage from those
before us, and that has produced
over the years men educated and
urbane.

A great part of this education
is based on traditions that have
weathered the test of time. Some
are vital, some are peripheral. All
are important in their way. We
like to think that we have recog-
nized the lessons and meanings of
our traditions and taken them in-
to our lives.

We say we are Christian (and
though we do not always live up
to the ideals, we profess as a group
to the belief); we say we are hon-
orabie (and though there are ob-
vious failures on the part of _in-
dividuals, for the group the sys-
tem works); we say we believe in
tradition and that we build our

LONG TERM GRIPE

Four years have gone by since
the first student movement at-
tempted to avert to our original
diploma. Always “misunderstand-
ings” with the faculty or adminis-
tration thwarted the petitions of
the seniors.

The present diploma was
adopted by the faculty in 1990.
The matter was not presented to
the students for consideration, al-
though the diploma fee was paid
by them. (We will say for the
present administration that it is
giving us an honest hearing.) We
understand that there was not
even unanimity in the faculty in
1980. But the old P. S. Ney diploma
of our first graduating class was
summarily done away with and the
graduating class was presented

tions and values of the institution which it represents. If the
present diploma does not perform this function, a change
would be highly desirable.

There are two possible alternatives; either to change
back to the traditional 1840 diploma or to keep the present
diploma. Assuming that the first alternative is desired, there
are three possible choices which should be considered: (1) to
adopt the 1840 diploma in its original size (18 x 22 inches)

\

at an increased cost of $2.75 per diploma; (2) to adopt the
1840 diploma in a slightly smaller size (15 x 20 inches) at an
increase of $2.00, or (3) to adopt an 11 x 14 version of the
1840 diploma with no increase in cost. Any one of the di-
plomas would be more in keeping with the traditional ideals
and values of Davidson college than the diploma we now have.

In a recent faculty meeting the matter of diplomas was
turned over to the Executive Committee for final action. The
Committee, feeling that since the College is, this year, award-
ing a five-year contract to the manufacturer of the diplomas
and seeking to settle the matter conclusively, decided that a
two-thirds vote of the total membership of the upper three
classes would be required in order to effect the change.

After four years at Davidson, a graduate wants something
that he can proudly show for his effort; something with his-
torical significance. We feel that the present diploma is not
such a document, and that now is the time when a change can
and should be made, if it is to be made at all.—H.V.L.

Panel or Group Pics?

Recently, on hearing that the Quips ’n Cranks was con-
sidering printing group pictures of the fraternities rather
than the individual panel shots which have been used in the
recent past, a cry of protest went up from some of the Greeks.

At present some of the fraternities seem to be getting
ready to issue a sort of formal protest to the annual editors.

The Davidsonian deems it a matter of discretion to re-
main as neutral as possible editorially on this issue. When
the annual editor was elected by the senior class, the implica-
tion seemed to be that decisions of make-up, policy, etc.,
would be left up to him, and his decisions would be final. We
feel that this is the way it should be.

It seems to us a bad precedent would be established if
the editor were constantly subjected to petitions and the
like from the student body. But on the other hand, the feel-
ings of the students ought certainly to be taken into considera-
tion in making up such parts of the yearbook in which so
many students are concerned.

If group pictures are to be made, it must be remembered
that it is much easier to get large groups together in theory
than in practice. Regardless of the personal responsibility of
the individual to report at the proper place and at the proper
time for a group shot, people are notoriously forgetful of
such things, but resent it when they are not included. It might
take considerable effort to get an entire fraternity group to-
gether at the same place at the same time.

Another difficulty seems to be the antipathy which some
of the fraternity men hold for having their fraternity pictures
made at the Union. In fact it does seem more appropriate
that group pictures of the fraternities be made in or in front
of their respective fraternity houses.

If this were done, we believe that a great deal of the
fraternity opposition would evaporate. In addition it would
be easier to enlist the aid of fraternity officers in getting
their men together for the pictures, as well as making each
fraternity picture more distinctive than if they were all taken
in the College Union.

As to the relative merits of group pictures and individual
pictures, we feel that it is simply a matter of taste, and that
group pictures could be made platable to the majority of fra-
ternity men, depending largely on where and how they were
taken. As we mentioned earlier, however, the affair is in the
hands of the annual editors.

Chapel Furore Over, But Faculty
Workingon Solution to Problem

The recent furore over chapel
has subsided somewhat in the last
few weeks, but it should be grati-
fying to the student body to know
that the faculty committee on
chapel has spent quite a few hours
recently in discussing the matter,
and it is possible that in the fore-
seeable future some definite—if
not radical changes will be made
in the College's policy on chapel.

This committee, composed of
Professors Workman, Bevan, Mc-
Cutchan, Morton, and Schenck, Dr.
Cunningham, YMCA Secretary
Sam Magill, and Dr. Spencer, seems
about to come around to the view-
point that instead of expecting ‘‘co-
operation” from the students -on
the College's chape: policy (Le.,
“compliance” with their viewpoint),
the committee may decide to start
from scratch and call student
body leaders into committee ses-
sion to re-examine present chapel
policy.

Betterment of Services

This, however, definitely does
not mean that the ending of com-
pulsory chapel is being seriously
entertained by any member of the
chapel committee or of the facul-
ty in general. What the chapel
committee is concerned with,
however, is the betterment of the
daily services in general, and an
improvement of the student atti-
tude toward these services.

Several attitudes seem at pres-
ent to prevail on the subject of
chapel policy. For some time now
the policy has been to try to di-
vorce secular subjects from chapel
as much as is possible, and to let
short chapels predominate, thus
placing the emphasis on the short

devotional exercise.
Chapel Only Drudgery

But what this policy and prac-
tice has done has been to take
away all opportunity for students
to blow off steam, as they used
to be able to do at some of the
very good pep meetings or at
one of the sessions of the Cripple
Creek Boys. It used to be that
students came into the auditorium
with hopes of such a silver lining
in the cloud of compulsory chapel,
but aow, it seems to me, chapel
is regarded by most students as
only a part of the daily drudgery
of school life. You go into the
auditorium now with the fervent
hope that the service will be short
and you can get a cup of coffee
afterwards or study for that third
period writ.

One alternate proposal that is
being entertained by some mem-
bers of the faculty is that all of
the five weekly chapel services be
cut short, as the Monday and
Wednesday services are
done now, and have in addition
to chapel, one or two student as
semblies a week, probably with
compulsory attendance. This, how-
ever, would only have the effect
of increasing the burden of com-
pulsory attendances the student
already must comply with.

Few Seculer Speakers

What the College has done in
divorcing the secular from the re-
ligious in chapel has, I believe,
had the effect of depriving the
student body of the opportunity
of hearing speakers and enjoying
good entertainment of a secular
nature which could certainly be
made to have educational value.

At present we are preached to on
Sunday night at length, and for
shorter, sometimes periods just as
long during the week. Surely it
must be obvious that good speak-
ers on secular matters are just
as important in their own way as
speakers on religious subjects.

It seems a lot to hope for, but
might it not be possible to com-
promise between secular and re-
ligious programs? Instead of hav-
ing six religious services a week
(including vespers), why not have
purely secular student body as-
sembiies on say, Tuesdays and
Thursdays? These two assemblies
should be compulsory, just as the
other four, but they would give
the students a chance to hear good
political speakers, businessmen,
doctors, or entertainment from stu-
dent body members. It would af-
ford a chance for the student body
to transact business when neces-
sary, and for the college authori-
ties to discuss important ard topi-
cal subjects with the student body
when they so desire.

Bftect of This Proposal

Under such a set-up, the student
body would have an outlet for ex-
pression of both emotion (which,
as Devidsenien columnist Jim
Moore recently pointed out as a
crying need) and ideas about any
facet of school life which it might
be desirable to discuss, And at the
same time, the three religious serv-
ices would be uncontaminated by
secular matters, and would, it is
to be hoped, be of the more ef-
fective, short type.

As stated at the first of this
column, there is no definite in-

After years of outdoor practice,
they will have to learn how to
use indoor plumbing for the first

great early morning rejuvenator.
In the old days, more than one
boy was seen with an oversize
Mongolian blue-spot covering the
better part of his “glutteus maxi-

ly mornings. Well, this too must

In retrospect, this is @ prej-
overdue

future on values that do not
change.

Yet in one public, and totally
unnecessary way, we deny all con-
nection with the past that made
Davidson great. I refer to our col-
lege diploma, a small thing itself,
but a representation of things
much larger. The diploma we now
receive has no connection with Da-
vidson traditions, it is in dubious
taste and, according to many mem-
bers of the past four classes which
have tried to change it, is one of
the greatest disappointments a
senior has thrust upon him.

It is in Latin, which is proper
for a ‘school of our type, but the
Latin is no longer printed in grace-
ful flowing script but in block
style of recent adaptation. This
may not be “pig Latin” to the
grammarian, but it is pig Latin to
those who had it thrust upon them,
for the students had nothing to do
with the present diploma.

True, the present diploma has
the Davidson seal. But look at the

‘seal. As it is now printed on the

finished product, it more nearly
resembles a Good Housekeeping
Seal of Quality or a stamp from
a third-rate law firm than the seal
of a century-old college. Original-
ly, the seal was affixed with wax

With the presentation of the
Student Council’s interpretation of
Section 2 under the article on
the Honor System in the Student
Body Constitution there has been
a great deal of discussion of the
subject inculcating a large amount
of adverse criticism which this
writen, as a layman in our Stu-
dent Government, feels is misdi-
rected and to a certain extend un-
founded. At times, “Our honor sys-
tem is falling apart,” echoes in the
halls of Davidson. Do such com-
ments have substantial bases?

Honor stands at the apex of our
constitution's structure. It is that
within one that makes him act
with integrity and morality of pur-
pose; true honor is not impelled
by external forces such as rules
and regimentation. It is that per-
sonal uprightness that  distin-
guishes a really mature and honest
person from the mental adolescent.

To this writer there appears to
be a basic incongruity in the
reasoning of so many who shout,
“Davidson is a prep-school,” and
then face about and demand that
the honor system be more closely
defined so that they may know
exactly how far they can go before
crossing the line between honor
and dishonor.

Section 2 says that “Every stu-
dent shal) be honor bound to re-
frain from cheating...” and
then goes on to list school work
including recitation, reviews, ex-
aminations, “. . . or any other

-| pledge work.” The large majority

of professors ask that a pledge
be signed in some manner on such
work. The interpretation written
last year says that any work which
one hands to a profeisor must be
his own work whether or not a
written pledge is presented, un-
less the instructor specifies dif.
ferently. Wherein lies any essen-
tial change? We feel that this
merely places the Davidson stu-
dent on @ level above that of a
pledge-signer and a cop-watcher.
This interpretation recommends
that the professor make clear the
difference between pledged and
unpledged work. How do we know
what unpledged work is? Ask the
instructor if in doubt. Certainly
the Student Council cannot and
will not attempt to take each pro-

with the new product on Com-
mencement Day.

The faculty wished at that time
to “modernize” the diploma by
cutting down on the size and by
changing the lettering from the
smoothly flowing script to the

trend of the day—stolid, block
Latin.
It seems,

however, that the

trends in diploma design were

changing with the times and the
Davidson faculty wished to keep
abreast of the sister institutions,
although such schools as the Uni-
versity of Virginia and Westmin-
ster College have never altered
their original diploma.

The “ideal” diploma had de
veloped into a much smaller size
than was thought proper in the
eighteen and nineteen century
American educational circles, The
seal came in for some attention
and was replaced by an impressed
seal on a paper superimposed seal.

Davidson was not willing, how-
ever, to relinquish entirely its
claim to antiquity in the diploma
and retained the large size and
decided to print the seal on the
sheepskin with the lettering. The
block letters were introduced and
the fine embellishments were re-
moved from around the college

fessor and each, course and de-
fine the pledge-unpledge-work line.
This sort of thing belongs at Home-
town High, not here.

The question of two students’
using the same book for reference
work on a pledged research paper
has been brought up. Can two
men study Bible 21 and use dif-
ferent text books? This reasoning
was brought down to laboratory
courses in what seems to us to be
false reasoning. The working out
of data is the important thing in
laboratory courses and where a
question of exactly what should
be one’s own initial work is left
again to the discretion of the pro-
fessor.

The chief argument against one’s
being honor bound not to cheat
without constantly placing it in
writing is that previously one could
cheat, have his conscience bother
him, and turn in a paper sans a
written pledge for a zero grade
without fear of being called up
for dishonesty. Has our constitu-
tion ever said anything like this?
Absolutely not. Then the contro-
versy lies in the procedure of a
student who has cheated and who
feels that he must make it known
to his professor. As before, the
decision then is left to the instruc.
tor’s discretion as to whether he
will give the student another test,
give hitn a zero, or turn him over
to the Student Council. Obviously
the latter is not probable in the

case of one who has voluntarily | ly capable gentlemen,

admitted cheating. If one will
pledge in writing that the work he
turns in is his own, will he not
also falsify when questioned about
it by the Student Council if he
has been deliberately dishonest?
“Honor was a positive action on
the part of the student but since
last spring's ruling...” Honor
still is a positive action placed on
the plain of Davidson College men.

Finally let us say that a student
who does not sign a written pledge
which is requested by his instruc
tor is turning in work which he
is saying is his own if he signs
his name to it. What reason could
one have for not signing a re-
quested pledge? Is he trying to
see how far he can go before he

work completed.

But this is not a diplems. The
word itself is traditional. With
it we associate sheepskin, the pomp
and ceremony of presentation, the
dignity and joys of Commence
ment. A diploma is a symbol. Four
years have gone into the making
of boy into man. The possessor
is now a bachelor. This, also, is
a word that has meaning only as
the word diploma has meaning.
Shall we discard all of this? Do
we want to be processed and given
a ticket?

For some schools the “modern”
way may be the appropriate way.
But most of us came to Davidson
because it meant more than an
educational factory.

If a diploma means anything it
means tradition and sentiment. We
will soon be given an opportunity
to vote away the present make-
shift and vote back the diploma
which rightfully belongs to David-
son.

We have been told we must get
a two thirds majority of the upper
classes before the changes

A DEFENSE OF DAVIDSON HONOR

case where honor is concerned,
then he does not belong here.
In summary, there has been no
change in our constitution. The
only difference from the days of
old is in the interpretation of
“pledge work” as work that one
hands in as his own whether or
not a definite honor pledge is writ-
ten out. The professor is to draw
the line between what is pledged
and what is not. This is as it should
be. Honor is a much-used term
and it is well that it should be for
it is the foundation of real in-
tellectual achievement beginning
on personal grounds. In reality the
question of honor is up to the
individuals that make up Davidson,
not the Student Government.

real soul of our college crumbles.
