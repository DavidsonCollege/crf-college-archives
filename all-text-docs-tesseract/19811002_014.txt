The Quiet.One; Airplane.

INE FILMS. HAS COME UP WITH
something of a curiosity this.
week. The Quiet One was

made in'1948 froma fine screenplay

by James Agee and was one of the first

American films to address seriously

the problems of delinquency and the.

debilitating effect of inner-city life on
ethnic minorities.

Put another way, it’s about the
inevitable slide of one Donald, (an as-
tonishing, performance by Donald
Thompson) a black kid in Harlem, in-
to corruption and youthful crime be-
fore his rescue by a benignly omnis-
cient: psychiatrist. The Quiet One of
the. title is of course Donald himself
who retreats into a highly personal
world when. down at street-level. Al-
though this suggests.a treatment of.
street-life firmly rooted. in the. inner
world of a fully-drawn character (ad-
mirably helped by Agee’s penetrating
commentary). the: approbation: which «

this featur has drawn from critics of,
the orthodoxly Marxist mould ‘proba-_
bly means hat personality and its con-
cerns are gradually extinguished in fa-

ae a more class-oriented view of

‘film alone prc

subject-matter, to say nothing of. its
treatment and style, was mildly revo-
lutionary to say the least. Previously,

urban deprivation had tended to find

its only expression in the romantic-es-
capism of Edward G. Robinson
gangster movies (i.e. the values and
themes: of the Western transferred to
Prohibition Chicago). Films like An-

' gels With Dirty Facestended to be the

norm and with the exception of the oc-
cassional outburst of sheer psychosis
(Fritz Lang, White Heat, High Sierra)

audiences could almost be forgiven:
- for failing to notice the changes.inr lo-
cation: from Montment ‘Valley to the’

Bronx.

At this time there tended to be no.
middle ground between sentimentali-

ty and psychosis and suddenly Holly-
wood discovered that it was possible
to make intelligent films about ‘con-
temporary social’ conditions and: not

balanced the effects of Donald’s love-

mother with the wider concems of the
