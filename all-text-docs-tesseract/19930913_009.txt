Rude Notes & Random Scribblings

“53 of the freshmen were vale-
dictorians of their high school class;
50% scored between 1200and 1300
onthe SAT; the average high school
class rank was in the top 5-10%.”

That is a description of the
freshmen class, the class of 1997,
the bearers of this once illustrious
college’s future, and it sounds to
me like they are all a bunch of
dorks. ‘

But wait, before I go on about
this stuff I want to address specifi-
cally the observations of some
anonymous authority types that feel
the need to slam The Davidsonian
in their classes.

Listen, we don’t go around
spreading nasty little tales and tell-
ing our classes that our writers
write as if they are in junior high
school. We don’t say that our
teachers teach with no tact and
pass judgement and insult us be-
hind our backs. We don’t specifi-
cally target people and insult them
in front of their peers. That just
isn’t the way we work. Well, some

times we do, like just now.
Anyway, back to the dorks, I
mean freshmen. Have any of you
seniors noticed that when you go
to the Pub it’s just not as crowded
as it should be. Used to be you
couldn’t move around on Monday
nights. The smoke filled the bar to
the point that you couldn’t see the

Frampton

other side of the room.

But now, it's just us. Sure
there»are a few token freshmen
hanging around the pool tables and
getting an early start on rush. But
it’s not like the old days.

Hell, even the cops notice it. I
was talking to Officer Laney on
Wednesday night and he even
thinks the place is getting a little
lame. He remembers the days when
people used to actually get.drunk

on Wednesday night. Now its just,
“I’m going to go and have a few
beers and then hit the sack.” Thing
is, now when people say that they
mean it. It’s not a lie.

Now, listen, I’m not encour-
aging full blown alcoholism. I’m
only encouraging a healthy dose of
binge drinking. Seriously, folks.
Get off your butts and hit Dover’s
for a twelve of the Beast. I’m sick
of this studying bullcocky. Go out
and get yourself a chick or a boy
and win on to them. Besides, this
is about the best study break there
is.

Now, I realize people may
think my style is a little flippant
and that it doesn’t makefora good
example. But I have always been
a perfect student at Davidson. My
sub-zero GPA will attest that. I’m
sorry if you think I am irreverent,
but I think you are a stupid-head,
so we’re even.

I think that the article is about

Do you really want to live with all of this?

By Rafael Candelario
&Travis Hinson

Upon returning tocampus this
semester, a few members of the
Black Student Coalition wentdown
to the house to find that it had been
used all summer and was filthy.

Nothing has been done about
this incident. A week later, a win-
dow was shattered by a bottle
thrown at close range. Whuz up!?

R: Yo whuz up Rock! It’s
nice to be Black again, oh, I mean
back again. I can finally see the
white, oops, I mean the light at the
end of the tunnel. I just hope that
we don’t receive any negative en-
ergy along the journey.

T: Yo Rafrod, the light at the
end of my tunnel gets very dim at
times. Just when I finally start to
feel good about Davidson, some-
thing like this always happens to
remind me that Mr. Charlie doesn’t
want me here. As Charles Thomas

‘Brooks III would say, “Another
day in paradise!”
(Mr. Charlie= the man, old whitey,
ie., the establishment that has con-
tinuously held the Black man, and
all other minorities down.)
Candelario& Hinson Black Slang
Dictionary 1993.

R: Yeah, I know the deal G!
My nigga, let’s start reeducatin’

Jo(&*"% (#@)!%@. “We” know
that people should be open minded
and considerate, but some of these
richies ain’t gotno common sense.
For example, the word “nigger.”
How many people have even both-
ered to look it up in the dictionary.
It is not in the first edition of Noah
Webster’s Dictionary.

And it is amazing how many
times the meaning has changed
due to societal beliefs and prac-
tices. Now, it essentially means all
the poor and disadvantaged people.
(My nigga: homey, homeboy,
friend.) Candelario & Hinson

T: O.K.! Enough of this nigga

business. Lets take care of some
real business. Yo Rafrod, Isn’t it
time to make that “Booty Call?!”
(Booty Call: A call usually made
in the late evening hours to some-
one of the opposite sex, for “the”
obvious reason.) Candelario &
Hinson Black Slang Dictionary

Seriously, what we write is
aimed at evoking a response from
students.. The opinions we share
are the right ones, but if you are
close minded, do not be.afraid to
communicate with us through writ-
ing or verbally. Dialogue is the
key to understanding. Stay Black!
Peace.

Go abroad,

young man

It leads to a true liberal arts education

By Susan Beale

Hi. Do you know me? If
you’re nota junior ora senior, you
can most likely answer “no” tothat
question. I am one of the many
students who studied abroad last
year and now I’m back for my —
GULP— last year at Davidson.

I’m not writing this article to
justify studying abroad or convince
you that my decision was correct,
but rather to share a few of my
interesting experiences and how I
can relate these experiences to my
life at Davidson.

If you’re thinking about
studying in a foreign country, but
are afraid that your language skills
aren’tstrong enough...never fear,
you’ll survive. You’ll face many
challenges, but in the end you’ll
realize how rewarding they were.

My first day in the Frankfurt
airport in Germany, I proved my
fluency (ha, ha) in one of the first
simplesentences that I uttered. All
the students from the Davidson
group decided that upon landing,
we would speak nothing but Ger-
man. It was a very hot day, and I
proudly proclaimed loud and often
what I thought to mean “I’m really
hot.”

Unfortunately, what I was re-
ally saying was, “I’m really homy!”
No wonder I received some strange
reactions from the Germans that
day.

About one month later, I was
becoming more confident with my

are strange and inferior. Those
who study abroad usually realize
this mentality is very dangerous
and ignorant.

Davidson is a wonderful
school where we can learn and
grow: the faculty is supportive and
completely capable of guiding us
further into the world of knowl-
edge and learning.

I feel, however, that there is a
problem at Davidson. If people
feel the need to disagree with the
“norm,” usually the pressure is
great enough that many will bite
their tongues and keep quiet. I
must admit, though, I have noticed
a positive shift in attitude on the
campus since I was a freshman,
and have sensed that people seem
less intimidated to address the im-
portant and pressing issues on cam-
pus. :
We do, however, have a-long
way to go. Last year I learned the
importance of accepting many dif-
ferent types of people, and realized
that there actually is a functioning
world outside of Davidson.

We should try to avoid insu-
lating and isolating ourselves and
say what we truly believe is correct
(even if our peers disagree).

Hey, is anybody still awake
outthere? Just one last note : if you
do decide to stay here the entire
four years, just be careful that you
don’t get so bogged down that you
start resenting Davidson. Make
the most out of your time and get

abilities and .was.actually tur~
ing conversations with German
students. One conversation seems
to come to mind: I was speaking
with a girl I had just met about the
differences in German and Ameri-
can food. Not knowing the word
for “preservatives,” I hoped I could
directly translate the word using a
German accent.
The word “preservative” is actu-
ally slang for condom.

So basically, I told this girl I
barely knew. that American food
had more condoms in it than Ger-
man food. Great first impression!
Anyway, I survived such embar-
rassments, and later could speak
quite well without completely de-
stroying the German language.

Notonly did I master a foreign
language, I learned many things
that I could never have learned
from a textbook. I lived in an
international dorm and therefore
had friends from almost every
majorcountry in Europe. Ourcon-
versations were absolutely fasci-
nating. Whatothertime in my life
will I ever have the opportunity to
be with so many different types of
people?!?!?

What I learned last year was
not necessarily theoretical and
philosophical, but what I saw and
experienced will enhance and en-
rich my life long after I’ve forgot-
ten what I learned from my books.

Don’t.get me wrong.

I’m not criticizing Davidson
or a liberal arts education; but I
will say that studying abroad for a
semester or a year will broaden
your horizons and make you so
much more aware of places other
than America. As Americans, we
tend to isolate ourselves and be-
lieve people from other countries

im 1 d and, really trakaat,
something for the improvement of
the campus.

Believe me, the students can
make a difference. But if you do
have the opportunity to study
abroad, seize it! My typical stress-
ful existence at Davidson (which I
believe many of you can at least
partially identify with) usually in-
cludes several of the following: an
annoying alarm which seems al-
ways to wake me up too early, an
early morning jolt of caffeine,
classes, a visit to the library and for
the highlight of an evening...an
occasional fraternity party or a
movie,

In Germany, however, my life
was so much different. I had the

‘time to travel and be completely

aware of my surroundings. Every
day I witnessed something new
and exciting, and I felt for the first
time that I really lived.

I’m not saying that if you stay
at Davidson for all four years that
your life will be incomplete, but I
will say that you should at least
consider this as a viable option. I
think some students believe that
people go abroad because they
don‘t like studying here.

At least in my case, that’s not
true. In fact, while I was away, I
compared Davidson to my Ger-
man university and now I’m actu-
ally more aware of Davidson’s
wonderful qualities that I actually
missed last year.

Anyway, I had a wonderful
time, but I must admit, it’s great to
be back and see my friends and
spend my last year of college at
Davidson. Oh yeah, if you meet
me on campus and think my face
doesn’t look familiar, I’m a senior,
not a freshman.
