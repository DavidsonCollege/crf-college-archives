McKendree Robbins Long :
From Davidson Student To Religious Artist

By Jim Carswell
On Thursday, November 7,
Robert Maschal, art critic for the
Charlotte Observer, delivered a
lecture on McKendree Robbins
Long, theartist whose “revelatory”
paintings are now hanging in the

Art Gallery in Chambers.
For those who attended,
Maschal offered interesting insight
into the mind of an eccentric but

talented local artist. A quick stroll:

through the gallery will hint at a
unique and perhaps disturbed ar-
tistic intellect. McKendree Long
was more, though, than a zealous
Christian painter.

In fact, Long was a Statesville
native, born there in 1888, and
even attended Davidson, though
only for a year, back in 1907-8,
when Davidson was not the liberal
and open place it is now. The col-
lege did not particularly welcome
so-called artist types. As a result,
Long left after only a year and
travelled to New York to study
with the Art Students League.

Theart world atthe time wasat
a crossroads, with the emergence

of American Modernism and»

Cubism offering a distinct and
rather conflicting alternative to the
established academic school. Long,
though, seems to have ignored the
new movements (actually, there is
noconclusive evidence he was ex-
posed to them) and concentrated

his early efforts on portraiture.

Maschal cited a 1908 letter to
his father in which Long expressed
a desire to become “a master of
masters.” This goal apparently led
him to Europe, where he studied
with a former student of John
Singer Sargeant. And he claimed
in fact to have

brush in the 1920s to pick up the
Bible. Apparently, his experience
as an ambulance driver in France
in World War] affected him deeply,
and Long let his religious fervor
grow.

Channelling it first into Pres-
byterian preaching and evangeliz-

met the master
himself.

The result
of all this edu-
cation was a
talented portrait
artist. Maschal
and others in the
audience
stressed that his
early portraits
exhibitacertain
artistic skill,
which can be
seen in the
paintings now
in Chambers.
Though the
revelatory
works were not
painted until the
1960s, the human figures reveal a
talent that remained years after his
original education. And in fact,
Long’s ability made possible a de-
cent living as an artist in New York
upon his return from Europe.

Other passions called him,
though, and Long put down his

ing, Long eventually became bored,

and switched to Baptism in 1935.

He hit the revival circuit as a fire-
and-brimstone preacher, billed as
a “Picture Painter of the Gospel.”

By that time, he had given up
painting entirely; however, he did
indulge adesireto draw, as Maschal

showed with slides from the pa-
pers that Long left. Some of the
drawings deal with the creatures
described.in the Book of Revela-
tion, which became increasingly
important to Long as he aged.
His notes, in fact, reveal a fas-
cination with the wars he witnessed,
the Cold War,
and nuclear
issues. Andhe
began toasso-
ciate these
subjects with
the Armaged-
don that
Revelation
describes. In
fact, a hymn
that he com-
posed identi-
fies nuclear
bombs as the
instrument of
God’s wrath,
which he ap-
parently ex-
pected soon.
Fi-

nally, he re- .
tired from preaching i in the 1960s

and turned back to art. As is évi-
dent in the paintings in Chambers,
though, he did not forget his reli-
gion or lose his fascination with
Armageddon.

These later paintings depict
various scenes from Revelation,

including the Apocalypse, the —
Judgment, and Hell. Human sexu-
ality becomes an important issue
as well, as the mysterious Lady in
Red appears several times in in-
triguing scenarios.

She was apparently a woman
with whom McKendree Long was
obsessed, and Maschal speculates
that she spurned his feelings, de-
spite the heart-felt letters and poems
he composed for her. The sexual-
ity issue appears in the representa-
tions of clouds as well. A close
look reveals they are sometimes
more than cumulus formations.

Maschal postulates thafLong’s
repressed sexuality,which seems
so important to understanding his
work, was a result of his Victorian
background. He was a “man of the.
Nineteenth Century” despite the
fact that he lived in our times. He
was known to wear a white suitand
carry a cane through Statesville,
where he once challenged'a man to
aduel forslandering a friend. Truly,
McKendree Robbins Long was an
unusual individual.

"Mistress of Mystery" To Open Alumni Lecture Series

By Beth Brown
“A New Mistress of Mystery..
Cornwell trots out her expertise in
a dazzling fashion... Postmortem
is a first-rate thriller, and I hope to
run into Dr. Scarpetta again.” --
Los Angeles Times

Patsy Cornwell’s degree from
Davidson led her to the morgue.

After graduating in 1979, she
became an investigative police
journalist for the Charlotte Ob-
server. She then moved to
Richmond, Virginiaand tooka job
in the chief Medical Examiner’s
Office.

These two experiences provide
the backdrop for a career as a mys-
tery writer. Her first. novel,
Postmortem, won the John Creasey
Award from the British Crime
Writer’s Association as the best

first crime novel of the year. Her
second mystery, Body of Evidence,
came out earlier this year, she is
currently writing a third.

Dr. Kay Scarpetta is introduced
in Postmortem as the Chief Medi-
cal Examiner of the Common-
wealth of Virginia. In preparation
for this novel, Cornwell took a
full-time job as acomputer analyst
in the Medical Examiner’ s Office.
She says, “It is important to me to
live in the world I write about. If I

want a character to do or know

something, I try to do or know the
same thing.”

How does one go from English
495 to becoming a successful
novelist? Cornwell says that the
best way is to write about what you
know -- in her case murder, crime,
and autopsies. Her mysteries are
set in Richmond and inspired by

real crimes that she has encoun-
tered through the Medical Exam-
iner’s Office.

Marcella Fierro (the mother of
two Davidson students) has been
part of the inspiration for Dr. Kay
Scarpetta. Cornwell has observed

_ Fierro’s work as a medical exam-

iner to provide the detailed (and
gruesome) descriptions of autop-
sies in Postmortem and Body of
Evidence.

Cornwell describes Scarpetta
as a bit like herself “only much
more intellectual and analytical.
Thankfully she does the work, I
would rather write about it.” Al-
though Cornwell has never per-
formed an autopsy, shehas watched
over 200. She depicts the morgue
with chilling accuracy.

She writes: “The wand prob-

ing several inches of Lori Peter-

son’s right shoulder when directly
over her right clavicle three irregu-
lar smudges suddenly leaped out
as if they were painted with phos-
phorous.

We both stood still and stared.
Then he whistled through his teeth
asa faint chillran up my spine. Re-
trieving a jar of powder and a
Magna brush, Vander delicately
dusted what appeared to be three
latent fingerprints left on Lori

Peterson’s skin.”

Women have traditionally
nothing more than the private-eye
role in detective mysteries. The

debut of Dr. Scarpetta.reflects a

growing trend of novels written by
and about women who speak from
their experience as FBI agents,
spies, or medical examiners.
Cornwell says, “we [women]

can write with authority, power,

and from experience. Combine that
with a woman’s sensibilities and
you have a compelling story.”

Patsy Comwell will be on.
campus November 14-15. She will :
read excerpts of her mysteries and
discuss the evolution of her un-
usual career on November 14th at
7:30 in the 900 Room.

- Areception and book signing.
will immediately follow the lec-
ture. Students will have an oppor-
tunity to to meet with her ina less_
formal atmosphere Friday morn-
ing.

The English Department and
the Alumni Lectures. Committee _
of the Union are sponsoring her
visit. Plan to attend the first Alumni

~ Lectures” évent of the year, cel-

brating the accomplishments of
Davidson graduates.
