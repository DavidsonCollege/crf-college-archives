Janitors Have New
Convenient Showers

Recently the college carpenters finished a pri-
vate shower under the fire escape in the -rear
of Georgia dormitory, reserved for the use of
the janitors of the school. The shower is fur-
nished very conveniently with cement floor, hot
and cold water, and other necessary accessories,

The janitors have been needing this for quite
a while, in fact, ever since the building of the
college, for after a day’s work in the dust and
dirt of the dormitories they may here clean and
refresh themselves before leaving.

Georgia dormitory seems to be the most con-
venient place available for such a necessary
thing, as it is mid-way between the rest of the
dorms in the row and therefore easily attain-
able for use.
