Shearer Hall, Wednesday evening. — For
over two hours these versatile young musi-
cians sung, played and laughed their joyous
way into the hearts of all those present, of
whom there was a full house. The entire

strumental music to more than please every-
one present. That it was well received was
attested to by the long and continued ap-
plause that threatened the very rafters of the
hall when a particularly striking number was
rendered, Choruses, solos, quartets, jazz and
symphony orchestras, and comedy skits made
the whole performance an enjoyable one for
both performers and those who listened.

spected in January by Staff of
Officers

Capt. Geo. H. Weems, on a recent visit to
Washington, where he saw the Army defeat
the Navy in a hard fought football, game,
attended to many matters of importance and
definite interest to the college. Perhaps the
most interesting thing he did while away
was the result of an interview at the office
of the chief of air service. He learned that
it would be permissible for the Fort Bragg
Air Service to take pictures of the Davidson

campus, town and the vicinity about from!
These pictures will be taken just |

when the Fort Bragg Air Service will see
fit; this will probably be some time before
Christmas, if the weather will permit. These
photographs will be valuable supplements in
training material. They will serve and an-

swer the purpose of maps and in this con- |

nection will . be especially valuable to the
students taking the R. O. T. C. course.
Captain Weems also learned from the of-
fice of the Chief-of-Infantry that Col. F. C.
Bolles, attended by others, would visit the
R. O. T. C. unit at Davidson some time in
January. All R. O. T. C. units in the United
States are to be inspected by members of the
office of the Chief-of-Infantry. In view of
this fact, the military department at David-

| Mr. Raines comes from Seattle, Wash.
|He spends eight months of the year lectur-
ling to the students in the schools and col-
ileges of the states, and is said to know more
Jabout Alaska than any other living man.
| He went to Alaska in ‘97, at the time of the
jrush which followed the discovery of gold
jin the Klondike. For 25 years Mr. Raines
|visited the différent towns and villages in
_ Alaska as a representative of the Treasury
Department.

Alaska, with its mighty glaciers, wonder-
fully beautiful waterways, great snow-cap-
ped mountains, gold mines, summer vege-
table gardens, sun lighted nights, quaint
|natives, dreamy moon-lit lakes, and thou-
;sands of other wonders, passed before the
audience as the pictures flashed from point
to point along the 9,000-mile journey which
|Mr. Raines promised at the beginning of his
lecture.

Mr. Raines said that in his 25 years in
| Alaska he had found 19 men frozen to death
along the trails, and had barely escaped a
like fate as he traveled from place to place
with his faithful dog team. He told many
interesting stories of the early days, when
men packed their provisions into the interior
on their own backs, cooked their own meals
individually, and endured countless other
