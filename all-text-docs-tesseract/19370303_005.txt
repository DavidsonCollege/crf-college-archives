PLAN FUTURE MEETING

Dr. Frank Poe Kapperonis
Speaks At Banquet

Eta Nu Pi, semi-classical fra-
ternity, which was recently or-
ganized on the Davidson cam-
pus has branched out to other
colleges in North Carolina and
nearby states and is rapidly
making itself known in college
circles. Eta Nu Pi is not strict-
ly a male organization and has
chapters located in several col-
leges for women.

Ed Finley, Fred McLean, Tom
Thurston, Bancroft Moseley, mem-
bers of the local, Alph-Alpha, chap-
ter were guests of the Nu Alpha
chapter at Salem college last week.
Dr. Frank Poe Kapperonis, promi-
nent psychologist of Cornell Uni-
versity, was the principal speaker
at the banquet given Saturday
evening as a part of the week-
end’s festivities.

Misses Edith McLean, Emily
Richardson, Annette McNeely,
Evelyn McCarty, and Helen Tot-
ten are officers in Salem chapter.

The banquet hall was appropriate-
ly decorated with the colors of Eta
Nu Pi. After the banquet Miss
Richardson presented the visiting
chapter with a book containing the
songs of Eta Nu Pi. A formal meet-
ing was held at which plans were
made for another joint session of
the two chapters.

LINGLE oPEAKS
AT CHARLOTTE

Dr. Lingle Fills Pulpit at My-
ers Park Church Last
Sunday

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president
of Davidson College, filled the pul-
pit of the Myers Park Presbyter-
ian church in Charlotte last Sun-
day. Dr. Edgar G. Gammon, pas-
tor of the church, was out of town
on a short vacation.

Dr. Lingle’s sermon was on Zach-
cus, the publican, who climbed the
sycamore tree in order to see Jesus.
Zacheus was a small man and it was
necessary for him to get in the tree
and above the surrounding crowd in
order to get a clear view of the
Savior.

“The crowd that we run with,”
said Dr. Lingle, obscures
our view of Jesus. If for our friends
we select people who are antago-
nistic to Him, or indifferent to Him
and His House, we shall lose sight
of Him. Our sins hide Jesus from
us, too, and our prejudices.”

It was further brought out by
Dr. Lingle that Christ Jesus, our
Lord, always reveals Himself to
those who seek him in earnest. The
warld is now hungering for a view
of Him, and when we find Him,
our outlook is entirely changed to
those things of the higher and
more noble things of life.

Gamma Sigma Epsilon, national

a very spectacular and entertaining
meeting Monday to which all the
members of the student body and
faculty interested chemistry
were invited.

A speech of welcome was made
by Harris Bradley, Grand Alchem-
ist who presided over the informal
meeting. Robert Lafferty aided him
acting as chairman of the program
committee. Bill Link offered as the
first experiment the peculiar be-
havior of chemical “snakes.” Mar-
ian Bryant, using material prepared
by Davidson students some 33 years
ago experimented with the rapid
oxidation of a peculiar iron com-
pound.

Jim Dickson illustrated the ex-
plosive property of the metal sod-
ium on a block of ice forming a
miniature cannon. Dr. Arbuckle is
the discoverer of this particular ex-
periment. J. W. Harper read a
paper on the development of a new
power-alcohol fuel to replace the
now existing gasoline used in in-
ternal combustion engines. Bob
