THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 12, 1925

WILDCAT DOPE

Tilson’s Cowboys End
Loop Season With Flash

Win Six Straight Gs Games as Team.
Takes Two From Hickory and
Valdese on Hill Trips

Coach Tex Tilson’s Cowboys ended a
highly successful season by winning all |
three games in their western trip last
week. The three victories were scored
ovér Valdese, Hickory Athletic Club, and
Mooresville High School. Formerly, vic-
tories were made over Hornet’s Nest
_Riflemen, Long Creek, and Mooresville
High, giving the Cowboys a record of
six wins out of six games, and demon-
strating that Coach
some real power in their playing.

Tex’s scrubs

Cowboys-Valdese, Feb. 2
Opening up their tour with a bang,
Coach Tex’s Cowboys ran away with

Valdese and piled up a 40-109 score against
them. The brilliant guarding of Gody-
koontz and the spectacular shooting of
Faucette were the features of the contest.
Goodykoontz had the difficult job of
guarding Simpson, former Trinity Col-
lege star. Simpson for more than one
year was picked as All-State, and is one
of the best players in the entire State.
However, Goodykoontz apparently did
not take all this very seriously, for he re-
fused to allow the former star a single
point. Faucette showed clearly his good
scoring ability by getting a total of 26
points out of the 4o.

Cowboys-Hickory, Feb. 3
following night Coach Tex took
scrubs up to Hickory to play the
second game of the western trip. The
Cowboys had no easy task before them
for they had their opponents the
powerful and fast quint representing the
Hickory Athletic Club which had already
proven to be an exceptionally good team.
The Cowboys began and_ continued
throughout the initial half with the same
excellent playing which they had dis-
played at Valdese the night before, end-
ing the half with the favorable score of
16-4. But in the final half, Hickory ral-
lied and pulled up their score almost
even with the scrubs. With desperate
fighting the scrubs were able to stall off
Hickory and emerged from the game
winners by a 20-17 score.

Cowboys-Mooresville, Feb. 5

The final game of the trip proved com-
paratively easy to the scrubs when they
defeated Mooresville High School by the
clear-cut score of 32-14. Mooresville
was never able to furnish any marked
opposition during the game and it was
only in the last half that they could make
the contest even mildly interesting. Da-
vidson held the lead during the entire
game, and literally smothered the high
school in the first half by playing rings
around them to the tune of 18-1. Moores-
ville apparently found themselves in the
last half and played well. For the
scrubs, Faucette played the best game
and was easily the star of the contest.

NORMAN PATTERSON
CAPTAINS MATMEN

At a meeting of the wrestling team held
just before leaving for the mect with Navy,
Norman G. Patterson was elected to lead the
Wildcat grapplers for the remainder of the
season. Patterson has been on the team for

the past three years, and has made a good
record in the 159-pound class.

Phil Cox was elected to manage the team
at the same time. He succeeded Patterson,
who was elected to the position of captain,
Cox has only been on the team since last
year, but has won his letter and has shown
his worth in the 140-pound class.

The wrestling team has started the year
well, winning thre out;of the four meets
held. N. C. State was Lay in Raleigh
last Saturday night, and Concord “Y” has
been defeated twice this year. The team lost
to Navy, considered the best team in the
country,

‘Saturday night the team meets Y..P.WI..
at Dawyidson, and next. week Carolina is to
be here. Other meets are being negotiated,
but arrangements have not been definitely
made.

| Flake is probably the best all-round
athlete on the campus. Hailing from the
i*State of Baseball Players,” he not only
excels in that sport but in football and
basketball also. When he came to Da-
vidson he broke into the field of sports
during football season. In his “Fresh”
year he intercepted a forward pass
thereby enabling Davidson to tie V. P. I.
when she was considered an casy victim.

| Ever since this incident he has been con-
had

sidered as one o fthe biggest factors of
Davidson's attack. In the. past season he
kicked two goals, thereby paving the
way for Davidson to tie N. C. State and
in the U.N. C. game his punts

in the backfield and in the line with

When Flake dons his basketball uni-

form and goes on the court, one at once
notices his powerful physique. He plays

ers on the team. Whenever the ball is
Flake is after it and few are the
times that he does not succeed in get-

goals to be counted for his Almat Mater.

Scarce indeed are the players who feel
confidence when they face Flake on the
diamond. Due to his pitching ability
and his knack of summing up his op-
ponents, he is one of the Wildcats’ main-
stays in baseball. We are looking to
you this spring, Flake.

Flake’s popularity is not only shown
when he is engaged in some game, but
he is also very popular on the campus.
He was on the Student Council in his
Sophomore year and is a member of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity.

W. M. BLACK

Football D*
In the 1924 football summary. The
Davidsonian referred to Black as “the

most reliable man of the team, playing a
perfect defensive game, and at times
showing wonderful drive.” This power-
ful and versatile fullback was unques-
tionably the most consistent gainer of
the Wildcat machine. His specialty is
a dynamitic smashing drive near the
center of the opponents line which time
and time again, with little or no inter-
ference, has carried him straight through
and over a mass of beef, which against
an ordinary back would be impregnable.
Practically always when a few yards
were desperately needed for first down,
Black was the man that took the ball;
and Black was the man who often made
a punt needless on the following down.
With all this amazing power and drive,
Black has only the ordinary weight of
161 pounds, which is much less than the
average fullback. One can appreciate
this wonderful drive only when he sees
Black in a stubborn game, cutting and
smashing through an apperent
wall of opposing weight.

Wick is probably. the most versatile
player on the Davidson eleven. His al-
ternation with Sappenfield i nthe pass-
ing attacks has been the immediate and
direct cause of victory in several in-
stances. At Pinehurst with only six
minutes to play and the Wildcats trailing
in the score, Black, who before had been
plowing and tearing through the Wolf-
packs dropped back on the Wildcats’ 20
yard line and took the entire State
eleven off its feet by sending a pass
straight to Hendrix, who went seventy-
five yards before he was downed. Then
Wick. became the receiver and went 18
yards on a pass from Sappenfield, only
to carry it over the following down on a
line-smash. In the Trinity game, Wick

winning touchdown was the result.

In the kicking department of the game,
Black has proven the surest man for the

in the entire season), an excellent and
steady man for the kick-off; and a splen-
did drop-kicker, In total points scored,

he ties with Hendrix; while in total
fground gained, he is among the three
leaders.

The town of Davidson claims Wick as
a worthy member of the Black family
which furnishes the Wildcats with his
long-remembered brother of the 1917
eleven, Wick a Junior, and even
greater things expected from him
next year.
