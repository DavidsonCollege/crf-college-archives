Winston Taylor, senior:

There are two sides, as always,
to the question of whether David

son is playing above its head in at
tempting to compete with larger
schools. Insofar as football is con
cerned, I am definitely in favor of
catering to opponents of our own
type--as was done to some extent
this year. However, I am equally

definitely opposed to severing rela

tions with larger schools in other
sports, simply because of the col-
lege’s resulting loss in prestige
From the student's viewpoint, this
is an important item and one to be
seriously considered. We have al-
ways been known as a college that

risk of injury, I for one am_hear-

reputation.

ENJOY POOL TABLE

x

Deeply encrossed in their game are these Davidson students, grouped around the new pool table which
was recently presented to the YMCA by Mr. and Mrs. W. Y. Preyercot Greensboro and New York. Included
in the gift were complete accessories for the outfit. Mr. and Mrs. Preyer were the donors of the infirmary
three years ago

From left to right, the students are: Jimmy Serugys of Rock Hill, G. T. Sherrill of Mooresville, Ralph
Clontz of Wilmington, Jim Darracott of Kings Mountain and Watt’ Withers of Davidson. The table was
tiven to the “Y"' upon the suggestion of Bobby Preyer, son of Mr. and Mrs. Preyer and a member of the
freshman class. This is the second son of the Preyers to attend Davidson. W. Y. Preyer, Jr, graduated in
the class of 1940. (Courtesy Charlotte Observer—photo by Billy Barker.)
