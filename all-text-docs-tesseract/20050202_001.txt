nm beginning

Rushdie tells the story
of his writing life

By JACKIE MCKEON
News Editor

British novelist Salman Rushdie
delivered the Davidson College
Connarroe Lecture in the Duke
Family Performance Hall last night.

Rushdie intended his lecture to
be a literary event in which he
would talk about his experiences in
becoming a writer.

“I want to
talk about

beginnings,” he said. “My begin-
nings and formations as a writer.”
He used the story “1,001 Nights”
and his early living quarters in a
“Toblerone box” attic to frame his
narrative.

Students had an overwhelmingly
positive reaction to Rushdie’s lec-
ture.

Tessa Davis ’06 approved of
Rushdie’s focus on his early devel-
opment as a writer. “I found the talk
of beginnings pertinent to college
students,” she said.

In 1988, Rushdie published
“Satanic Verses,” a novel that was
banned throughout India for its sup-
posed blasphemy against Islam.

Difficulties with room tempera-

ture control and a recent heating“

failure have sparked concern
among students who live in Akers,
Irwin and Knox, the dorms known
as the Sophomore Apartments.

A breakdown on Jan. 18 forced
students from several halls to sleep
without heat as the temperature
outside dipped below 17 degrees
Fahrenheit.

The extreme conditions prompt-
ed several students to find warm
beds in other dorms or check into a
local hotel.

George Kallop, father of Liz
Kallop ’07, supported his daugh-
ter’s decision to check into a hotel
for the night and encouraged her to
bring friends from the hall.

“I was annoyed that something
like this could happen at Davidson,
and I was particularly annoyed that
