Week in Washington

Clinton calls for

expanded federal
powers in response to
Oklahoma City tragedy

By ANDREA SHORT
Washington Week correspondent

With the nation still shocked
and horrified by the bombing of
the Oklahoma City federal build-
ing, President Clinton is seeking to
prevent such incidents by strength-
ening current federal guidelines.

Civil liberties organizations,
however, are expressing skepticism
about the need for, and the wisdom
of, expanding the Justice
Department’ s power to investigate
and monitor possible terrorists.

On Wednesday, President
Clinton detailed his plans fot new
legislation. Less drastic than his
initial plan, Clinton’s proposals did
not include a revision of the guide-
lines that specify when federal
agents may begin investigating
suspects.

Currently, agents cannot pro-
ceed with an investigation until
“the facts or circumstances rea-
sonably indicate.” Many expected
Clinton to revamp these instruc-
tions to allow more. pro-active in-

quiries,- but the Administration:

apparently sensed the political dan-
ger involved in giving unspecified

and unsupervised authority to the
Federal Bureau of Investigations.
Asaresult, they backed away from
the proposal.

President Clinton’s blueprint
for tougher anti-terrorism legisla-
tion revolved around increasing
federal manpower and resources.
He advocated adding 1,000 fed-
eral agents and creating a new do-
mestic counterterrorism office un-
der the power of the Justice De-
partment.

Justifiable grounds for install-
ing wiretaps, obtaining travel and
financial records, and instituting
other surveillance methods would
also be broadened under President
Clinton’s plan. Currently, only a
handful of suspected federal of-
fenses can justify surveillance. If
Clinton’s proposals become law,
however, individuals suspected of
any federal felony could be subject
to surveillance.

When dealing with bombs and
other weapons capable of creating
tragedy as devastating as that in

Oklahoma City, the FBI could co-

operate and- combine resources
with the military.. Passing this te-
net of President Clinton’s proposal

NEWS

would mean altering a policy that
has been U.S. law for more than a
century.

The Posse Comitatus Act of
1878, which forbids the military
from executing civilian law, was
passed after the Civil War and
Reconstruction eras. Clinton
would create a narrow exception
inthe law to allow the armed forces
to aid the FBI’s investigation of
nuclear, atomic, and chemical
weapons.

Another change suggested
by the president would mandate
“tagging” the raw materials used
to make explosives. This would
aid identification of the explosive
after it has been detonated.

Clinton has been unrelenting
in his calls for tougher policy and
legislation and has openly sup-
ported the death penalty as justice
for individuals convicted of the
Oklahoma City bombing. On 60
Minutes last Sunday, the President
said, “If this is not a crime for
which capital punishmentis called,
I don’t know what is.”

Mass killings in Rwanda
jeapordize foreign aid

By GRAHAM ERNST
Dean Rusk adjunct reporter

Last Saturday, more than
2,000 members of the Hutu tribe
died in arefugee camp in the South
Rwanadan village Kibeho when
Tutsi government soldiers opened
fire and a panic ensued.

The episode began when refu-
gees tried to break through the
military perimeter surrounding the
camp which lacked sufficient food
and water for the 50,000 inhabit-
ants.

In response to the news of the
deaths at Kibeho, the Dutch gov-
ernment put its $30 million in aid
on hold.

United Nations officials criti-
cized the Tutsi government for
underestimating the death toll at
Kibeho. Government officials,
who originally placed the death
toll at 300, said that it was difficult
to count all of the bodies because
there were so many different lay-

ers, and they could not estimate -

how many lay underneath the sur-

’ face.

The scene was gruesome. In-
sects hovered over the layers of
crammed bodies that were trampled
in the stampede. This most recent
incident is a harsh reminder of the
genocide that took place a year ago
when halfa million Rwandans died
in less than three months of tribal
warfare.

Two months ago, 24 people
accused with genocide last year
suffocated due to extreme over-
crowding in their prison. Prison-
ers continue to be held in inhuman
conditions without any action by
the U.N.

The Tutsi government has or-
dered that all refugee camps be
closed and that people return to
their former home.

More than 200,000 Hutus
await permissions to return to their
homes that they abandoned a year

‘ago. While many hope that peace

can eventually prevail when they
return, there are no guarantees as
20 refugees were found dead in a
jail north of Butare.

U.N. trucks have already es-
corted more than 7,000 Hutu back
to their homes. U.N. officials,
however, lack the resources to in-
sure that all 200,000 will be safely
returned.

The news of the continued
instability in Rwanda is likely to
deter the two million Hutus refu-
gees in Zaire from returning. Fur-
thermore, nations such as France,
Kenya, and Zaire, who favored the
former Hutu government, are now
content to stand idly by.

One U.N. official called this
latest incident a “big step back” in
the establishment of a legitimate
government in Rwanda.

NOTES

Notes from the Charlotte Police Department

Crazed woman
-A man reported that an unknown female was calling him
every 45 minutes to tell him that he will be dead by the afternnon.

Drunk dolt

-A man drank an excessive amount of alcohol and fell onto a
glass table, which caused him some minor scratches and cuts.
Soon after, the man “attempted to out himself” with pieces of the
broken table, at which time a friend called the police.

Frightening flashers

-A woman was walking from her car to the mall when she saw
a man sitting in his car with the driver’s door open. She noticed
he was naked from his waist to his ankles. She reported she turned
away but heard a car horn, which she believed was the man trying
to get her attention again. :

-Another woman told police that while she was standing on
her front porch, a man going by pulled his penis out of his pants and
showed it to her.

Desperate for a drink

-Two suspects approached a man who was standing nearby
witha case of beer. They asked him fora beer, and when he refused
they began punching him. Another person jumped in to try to help
the man and was also punched before the suspects took off.

Hundreds protest police beating of teenager

-Hundreds crowded into a church Saturday to assail police for
beating a teenager and spraying him with tear gas during an arrest
captured on videotape Tuesday.

Pharon Crosby, 18, ahigh school honors student, was punched,
kicked in the ribs and sprayed with Mace by officers who were
trying to disperse an unruly crowd of teenagers loitering at a
downtown bus stop.

Crosby had refused orders to leave the area and resisted while
an officer tried to handcuff him, Police Chief Michael Snowden
said: Crosby did not require medical treatment.

The Tuesday arrest has raised questions about excessive force
or whether it was racially motivated. Two of the three officers
involved in the arrest are white; Crosby is black.

“We will not plea bargain,” Crosby’s lawyer Perry Davis told
abouut 400 people who packed Bethel Baptist Church.
