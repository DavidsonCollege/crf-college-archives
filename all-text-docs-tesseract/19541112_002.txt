Broader Horizons

After two months of this business of
being at Davidson during the ’54-’55 term
it may well seem to those who heard Rev.
Sam Newell’s Orientation Week sermon
that he struck a key tone which has been
sounded in several other areas of campus
thought throughout the past few weeks.
Because the relevance of God to our wid-
ening horizons was covered in its appro-
priate setting, the sermon, we wish to
call attention to the other fields of which
our knowledge has been increased, our
sight and scope expanded.

President Cunningham’s Evanston ad-
dress prompted reflection and discussion
of some of the issues of the World Coun-
cil of Churches and brought to a campus
highly conscious of denominationalism and
sectionalism a healthy economical aspect.
Who could forget the observation that pri-
vileged, prosperous Americans attending
that Assembly were almost embarrassed
at their good fortune when confronted
face to face with Christian brothers who
had sacrificed just in order to represent
their sometimes suffering, often strug-
gling peoples from many parts of the
earth? And who was not impressed by
the questioning of our use of “foreign”
missions or the ethical problem of testing
atomic weapons “out there,” to the detri-
ment of our fellows in other parts of the
world? Who did not leave with a wider
concept of world Christianity?

The theme of world community was
heard again on United Nations Sunday.
Some were jarred in their thinking about
race when reminded that more than a
billion people of color were looking to
their nation and perhaps their hometown
for encouragement and hope. Many were
feeling anew the urgency of action which
from time to time stirs in a generation
of college students, one generation pre-

paring to take its place in a “world with
a hydrogen bomb in its bosom.” There
was a noticeable width to the Honorable
Frank P. Graham's understanding of a
world and its wars.

An emphasis on European students’
problems and their relations to those in
the United States was brought to the cam-
pus even more recently by the Y, in an
address by a representative of World Uni-
versity Service, and we may have first-
hand information from European students
studying at Davidson this year. There are
opportunities to broaden outlooks, and
there are people aware of college and
university students all over the world.

We who are comfortable do well to
remember those who are cold.

We who complain about the constancy
of diet do well to think of those who are
saving lunch money to take night classes.

We who have more books than incli-
nation to read may well share some with
fellow-students, such as those who need
books and magazines relating to the social
sciences at the Law College Building of
Nagpur University, Nagpur, India.

How can we who are socially secure
do less than sympathize with students who
are rejected from their villages for trying
to share their education?

We who are trying to decide which
job to take after college, what shall we
say to him whose backward community
does not even know it needs him?

Those who have generous help may
be able to remember those who are afraid,
today and when tomorrow is today.

They who think, can consider world
student service, even in the face of Amer-
ican Education’

” They Can ‘sa yer for the stu-
dents of the whole world, those who pray.

A Federal Stalemate

With the results of last week’s na-
tional balloting complete President Eisen-
hower has become the third president in
the twentieth century to confront full
opposition at midterm. With the Demo-
crats taking the control of both houses
and of eight new governorships it seems
that the man in the White House is all
alone, and disappointed if not full repu-
diated in his arduous campaign efforts.

History and the south shed light on
other sides than party names, however.
Recent history tells us that it is quite
normal for the party in power to lose
considerably at mid-term. The Republi-
cans just didn't have the margin neces-
sary in the 83rd Congress to take Con-
gressional defeats and still stay on top.
The present condition of the Democratic
Party in the south tells us that the Demo-
cratic numerical majority is but a shield
to hide a basic split in the party which
is much more serious at this point than
is the Republican split over the junior
senator from Wisconsin. Southern Demo-
crats to a large degree are democrats in
name only (or perhaps they are the only
‘real’ Democrats), gleaning their political
philosophy from an adapted John C. Cal-
houn or a Republicanism even more con-
servative than that of the late Mr. Taft,

but refusing to call themselves by the

name of a party that was organized to
raise the standards of the Negro.

The situation in Washington for the
next two years will be one of stalemate.
The Democrats (whose leaders Senators
Johnson of Texas, Clements of Kentucky,
and Representative Rayburn of Texas and
McCormack of Massachusetts have all
voted with the administration on a ma-
jority of its measures) won't be able to
get any major legislation across through
the inevitable vetoes of the President, or
more likely, the paralysis of the southern
clique. The Republicans will find them-
selves in a minority and unable to drum
up support on most major issues. Only
in foreign policy is progress likely. Here
the Democrats seem out to pass the Re-
publicans in proving their support of the
administration. One other ray of hope,
a dim one, will be party cooperation on
administration politics, a general trend
during Eisenhower’s administration so far.

Mr. Eisenhower looks with hope to the
next two years, stating that he has a pro-
gram which represents progress for Amer-
ica, and which he will continue to work.
We find it hard to believe, however, that
statesmanship will lick politics for a
change, and lean toward support of his
campaign prediction that a Democratic
victory would create “chaos”, or, more
apt to the situation, a legislative stupor.

Left-wing Or Liberal?

Many violent anti-Communists use the
term “liberal” as a synonym for Commun-
ist, left-wing, or radical. Strictly speak-
ing, a liberal is one who advocates im-
provement, change, and reform.

Although the sober opponents of Com-
munism realize the vast difference be-
tween a liberal and a left-winger, many
McCarthyites continue slurring the mem-
ory of the world's great liberals through
their use of the. word.

Among history's famous “fuzzy think-
ing” reformers were:

A Jewish prophet who stood atop
Mount Sinai to proclaim ten rules to live

1 ne carpenter’s son of Nazareth nail-
ed to a wooden cross for ideas subversive
to Rome.

An Italian astronomer forced by the
Pope to quit teaching his heretical doc-
trine that the earth travels around the sun.

A red-headed Virginia lawyer who ad-
vocated the right to revolt and dared to
say “all men are created free and equal.”

The tall, ugly Dlinois rail-splitter will-
ing to fight a war to protect the rights of
slaves in the South.

1X SMO—L OOVGT IF THESE SHOWER-HEADS HAVE EVER. GEEN CLEANED.

By Executive Committee

Student’s Hopes For More
Liberal Cut System Crushed

Resolved:

§. That Feeulty members are
not permitted te give “make-up”
reviews to students whe have
cut for reasons other than (a)
Sickness in Infirmary (b) Parti-
cipation in College-sponsored af-
fairs (not Student dances and
the like) (c) Emergencies.

tt. The professor shell record
sero for those missed reviews
not specifically covered by (e),
(b), and (ce) above.

101. EXCEPTION: The profes-
sor, at his discretion, may recom-
mend to the Dean of Students
and for the Executive Committee
that a student be permitted te
take a “make-up” review, even
though the “cut” is not covered
by (2), (b), and (ce) in t.

Tuesday afternoon the feculty
committee met behind closed doors
and altered a tradition of long
standing on the Davidson scene:
the right of any student to cu? o
review.

Undoubtedly the committee felt
that it was acting in the best in-
terests of the student body; how-
ever, in setting up this new rule
which is to go into effect Decem-
ber 1, the committee members ap-
pear to have overlooked some very
important facts. As the rule now
stands, a student may cut a re-
view and take double cuts in so
doing. In addition, the student may
take a make-up review at a time
when it is suitable to both the pro-

SY JOHN D. FITE

fessor and student.

It is evident from the above that
a student is given virtually no free-
dom whatsoever. Not only is the
student completely at the whims
of the Executive Committee but,
in addition, se is every feculty
member. No longer can a profes-
sor use his own discretién about
what course to follow in the event
of a student cutting a review. He
must contact the Executive Com-
mittee and petition, on behalf of
the student involved, for the right
‘to give the student a make-up test.
Whether the Committee will grant

three reviews assigned for one
day? Whet about the student
who will miss a ride home (say,
for example, to Mississippi or
Ploride) because cf = review
scheduled for a fourth or fifth
period on the day before a holl-
day season? What ebout the stu-
dent that feels that he needs to
cut because of some sudden sit-
vation which arises?

It is evident from the above-
mentioned illustrations that the
student cannot possibly know
whether the Executive Committee

will. approve his petition or not.
this is solely up to the ay petiole se, it aH. hasisppossible for

the Committee and any petiti
may be refused. In that case, the
student will receive a ZERO on

a zero even on one review. It boils
down to this: CUT A REVIEW AND
FAIL THE COURSE.

The disadvantages ef this new
ruling are self-evident; hewever,
let’s look at @ few situations
which will peint these disad-
vantages even mere vividly:
What of the student whe sheuld
sleep through e@ review? Mere
than one student hee slept
through a first period clees quite
unintentionally. ts it sight that
he should be endangered te the
extent of felling the whole
course because of this? What of
the students that plen te ge
home early te work during the
Christmas holidays? What about
the students whe have twe or

lo con! the committee be-
fore hand since the committee
meets only once a week. Possibly

longer allowed to use his own dis-
cretion. In short, the teacher has
become the humble servant of an
ever-increasing Davidson bureau-
cracy.

Red Tape

The ruling has already been ap-
proved and is soon to go into effect
unless the student body will join
with the members of the faculty
who are also opposed to the new
law. The professor, who certainly
knows the student better than the
Executive Committee and can bet-
ter understand a particular situa-
tion, should be allowed to make_his
own decision.

Letters To The Editor

Good or Bad?

The Pax Feeney: A
Result Of Apathy?

BY MALCOLM WILLIAMSON

It has come to our attention that
an unusually quiet and peaceful
attitude is the currently prevailing
spirit on the campus. There is no
annoying petition signing; there
have been no petitions. There are
no imperative issues, either politt-
cal, religious, or ludicrous such as
was the furious diploma storm of
a former era.

Chapel And Vespers

Chapel conduct is the best since
old Chambers was constructed, and
due to the much improved chapel
policy of the administration there
is no longer any real opposition to
chapel. Vespers rudeness was
curbed by quietly closing the bal-
cony to students. These are laud-
able ends, and they have been
achieved by clever and astute
means, The administration has
shown a mature political judgment
which was not always demonstrated
so effectively in past years. Every-
oné has been benefited.

But the current spirit of peace
and contentment is not only found
in the fleld of school-student rela.
tions, The intra-student relations
are relatively quiet.

YMCA

The once badly maligned YMCA
now suffers from no vulgar abuse.
It was not abolished, nor was mem-
bership made voluntary. Through
the passage of time, the wounds
have ‘healed, and the YMCA, its
war-chest undamaged, continues as
a potent force in campus life. We
wonder if the decision regarding
the future of the Y was not made
in the typical Davidson way —
passive apathy instead of affirma-
tive decision. But evidently this is
perfectly acceptable to the student

Little Mencken

body, and the YMCA leaders
should fee] that they have receiv.
ed a tacit mandate from the stu.
dents for the continuation of their
previous program.

Student Government

The major field in which peace
reigns supreme is that of the stu.
dent government. The present ad-
ministration has achieved an amaz-
ing success in its acceptance by the
students. Never before has there
been so little criticism of any re.
gime. Never before has the coun.
cil gone about its duties so un-
hampered by student interest or
concern. But perhaps this is to be
expected when practically no infor-
mation of that body’s activities
ever reaches the student’s ear—
not even through that ancient in-
stitution, the grapevine. If this ad.
ministration’s goal was the main-
tenance of the status quo, they
seem to be achieving it since time
is passing, and there is no sign of
any imminent change.

A Student Assembly

What has become of the propo
sal supported by ODK that a stu-
dent assembly separate from the
judicial board be created? The ef-
fectiveness of a regularly schedul-
ed student council session open to
interested students over a meet-
ing of the entire student body in
chapel can hardly be doubted if
the object is to bring forth sound
proposals from the students,

We do not know the answers to
many of the above questions, but
we do know that many Davidson
students would like to feel that
they can have some part in the
student government even at the ex-
pense of the lethargic quiet which
now exists. .

The Lions Den or How To Wait
On A Football Training Table

BY HIRAM CATON

Everybody that is anybody has
noticed the terrible spirit of our
football team. It is obvious during
practice sessions, games, and near-
ly any other time when the team is
gathered. I have been privileged
to take a very intimate look at
them as I help wait the football
team’s tables in the Student Un-
fon.

Lions Den

Have you ever tried to feed a
lion? Neither have I, but I think
that I have a pretty good idea of
what it would be like.

While my colleagues and |
diligently work to have the ta
bles set up for feeding time at
one o'clock, four or five men
usually come into the dining hall
and plegue our efforts. The read-
er must understand that the kit.

of desserts and salads that it
takes to provide one of each for

WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Selection Ot “Prejudiced” Men For
Compulsory Services Is Criticized

About . .

Mike Barron, writing in the Em-
ory Wheel, finds distorted vision
in the scissor workings of the At-
lanta censor who cuts clean sex
from movies and passes with sadis-
tic glee over brutalities unmen-
tionable in polite company. Refer-
ring to “The Egyptian,” Barron
states “. . . the Atlanta censor was
quick to scissor out the scenes of
Bella Darvi bathing, but she seem-
ed to see nothing wrong with the
seene where the Egyptian slave
was crushed to a bloody mess un-
der a stone used to build the pyra-
mids. The camera lingered loving-
ly on the scene while the scream-
ing slave was squashed. Which do
you think is more objectionable,
Bella Dagvi taking a bath or some-
one being crushed to death?” Both.

Way up in North Carolina W. C.’s
Cerolinian made a plea: Vote Re-
publican! Speaking to a solid south
it defended the value of a two-
party system. Said the Cerolinian
“Party affiliation should count lit.
tle in this. Every Republican vote
in the South is a protest against
the lazy inefficiency, corruption,
and slow progress which is the al-
most inevitable result when one
party holds unchallenged political
power and faces no competitor in
efforts for the benefit of the peo-
ple. It is at the same time an en-
couragement to the growth of com-
petitive vigilance and a step toward
a remedy of the situation.” Shades

. Sex, Statesmen, And Southern Writers

of Walter Hines Page and the Por-
gotten Man!

Meanwhile the Greensboro Daity
News had some editorial comments
on the south as a literary locale.
Calling attention to the release
from the magnolia and mint julep
tradition in southern writing
brought forth by the stark writ-
ings of Caldwell, Faulkner and Lil-
lian Smith, the News (as quoted in
the Dally Ter Hell of U.N.C.) had
the following to say of the “welter
of murder, arson, lynching, rape,
incest, perversion and so on”:
“Some of this was literature; most
of it was the bunk; and all of it
taken together gave a picture of
the South about as true to life as
that modernist artist’s painting of
‘A Nude Descending A Staircase.’
The South’s portrait looked more
like a picasso than an Eakins.

“But each reaction causes anoth- ;

er reaction, and there are signs
that Southern literature is moving
from inferno to purgatory and. cool-
ing off a bit. What signs? Well,
there is Ovid W. Pieree’s The Plen-
tatten, and there is Frances Gray
Patton’s Goed Merning, Miss Deve.
Both contain a lot of truth and a
good bit of art. These scraps of pa-
per may show which way the wind
is blowing.”

Next week: What they are seying
abou? segregation.

Letters concerning the same
issue have been submitted by
Stanley Miller and Richard M.
Hamor. These will be published
next week in the segregetion
issue if the authors signify thet
they so desive.-Ed.

Dear Editor:

If there is a freedom of speech
at Davidson College, why do we
have to sit back at compulsory
services and continually listen to
a very one-sided view on the issue
of segregation and not object out-
Fright to that portion of the student
body which only wishes to hear its
views aired and hopes or believes
that there is only one view to
hear?

ts it not possible thet we could
persuade such o person eas Her-
man Talmadge of Georgie to en-
tertain us in Chapel with his
ideas on ion?

A large percentage of the stu-
dent body is known to be for seg-
regation and for that element I
would like to quote two sentences
taken from an Alabama newspaper.
They seem to fully describe what
would take place when and if seg-
tegation is done away with—

“White end Negro children in
the same schools leads to miscege-
Nation. Miscegenation leads to in-
termarriage which leads to mon-
gralization of the human race.”

Sincerely,

Dear Editor:

It seems that in a liberal arts
college both sides of any current
and important controversy should
be presented by competent expon-
ents of each viewpoint. Such is not
the present case at Davidson on at
least two vital questions: Church
Union and racial segregation.

The tone of the speakers both at
compulsory vespers and at compul-
sory chapel has been uniformly
pro-union and anti-segregation. No
speaker. has fairly set forth the
opposing view to either of these
questions. This has not been due
to a lack of competent proponents
either of the continuation of ra-
cial segregation or the continua-
tion of the autonomy of the Pres-
byterian Church, U. S. The one-
sidedness of the presentation is
due solely to the choice of speak-
ers.

Considering the recent poll of
the student body on the question of
racial segregation, it is clear that
the opinion on this subject is al-
most equally divided on the cam-
pus. Perhaps we might be allowed
to hear both sides fairly presented
and determine for ourselves their
relative merit.

Sincerely,

every man on the team. Well,
these “early birds” rake havee
on our efforts by gathering up
two or three salads and desserts
and eating them befere the rest
of the team comes in. This, of
course, leaves us with « deficit,

arrive and discover thet “we
have shorted them” a dessert or
salad, they scream end yell end
jump up end down and <n

that we end Mr. Murphy

This type of thing is very dis-
couraging as there is no one more
sympathetic with the team than I.
I feel sort of a maternalistic re-
sponsibility for them and it cuts
me deeply for them to make such
odious accusations.

Sometimes when we waiters
are a little bit lete they become
awfully impatient. They heat on
the table with their spoens and
this makes @ noise loud eneugh

he is eating, end Mr. Smith eats

weren't enough to let everybody
know that their dinner is late,
they also shout in e@ singsong
chythmn, “Where's the feed.”
This is repeated without Inter-
mittance until the food appears,
whereupon a tumultuous sheut
of glee goes up. Meanwhile, ew
eryone standing in line af the
cafeteria is impressed with the
waiters’ inefficiency.

Just as we are unloading the cart
and have our hands full trying to
serve five tables between the three
of us, one or two particular play-
ers will always shout, “Want some
bread!” or “Want some jelly!” or
whatever happens not to be on his
table. These “I want” shouts when
we are obviously busy serving
some other tables are especially
disquieting.

Probably everyone has specu-
lated about how much the feant
eats and who the biggest ester
is. As to how much they est, |
can only say that they elweys
want more than is in the kitchen.
