New freshman hall created in Cannon

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL
News Editor

Prepared to spend the school
year below ground, eight upper-
classmen received a lucky phone
call this summer.

Residence Life Office (RLO)
staff contacted each of this year’s
basement Cannon residents with
news that their sunlight-deprived
underground quarters had been
transformed. Students who, after
last spring’s housing lottery, found
themselves scheduled to live in
Cannon’s basement rooms now re-
side in one of Davidson’s most
sought after residences: the Manse.

A veritable palace, the Con-
cord Street Manse has three sun
rooms, a full kitchen which boasts
a brand new refrigerator, as well as

IVCF

However, two years ago when an
abstinate homosexual student was
discouraged by anIVCF staff mem-
ber from submitting his applica-
tion for 1VCF leadership, Davidson
College administration asked I[VCF
to outline its leadership require-
ments to avoid similar incidents in
the future.

Just minutes before the 33
members present at the April 30
SGA meeting confronted IVCF’s
appeal, the Senate voted to take
steps to avoid future confusion and
controversy. Many felt that the
SGA by-laws regarding charter re-
quirements were not specific
enough to warrant denying IVCF’s
charter.

The senators adopted the fol-
lowing resolution to be incorpo-
rated in the SGA by—laws: “... the
Senate of Davidson College does
hereby condemn. discrimination
based on ‘race,.color, religion, na-
tional origin, age, disability, sex
[and] sexual orientation except

where appropriate and allowed by

law’ ... the Senate of Davidson
College in no action that it has
taken this year or will take in the
future intends to condone discrimi-
nation based solely on the factors
listed above.”

furnished living and dining rooms.
However, even the Manse was not
immune to initial setbacks.“We
didn’t have beds the first night [I
moved in],” ‘said April Edlin, a
sophomore. That night four stu-
dents who arrived on campus early
shared two available mattresses.
According to Edlin, the next night
temporary beds had been provided,
and within several days each bed-
room was equipped with lofts.

» By date-last November, said ~

Kurt Holmes, Director of Resi-
dence Life, RLO had already pub-
lished and reserved freshman

‘rooms based on the Admission

Office’s enrollment goal for the
Class of 2000. At 442 freshmen,
the incoming class is almost ex-
actly the target size which
Davidson’s Admissions Office

hoped to enroll this year, said
Leonard Satterwhite, Senior Asso-
ciate Dean of Admission and Fi-
nancial Aid. RLO scrambled to
come up with solutions to the hous-
ing crunch. Options which sur-
faced over the summer included
converting dorm lounges into dorm
rooms, using Johnston Gym as a
temporary barracks, and breaking
with tradition to make Belk a co-ed
building.

Freshman Alex Oregon, who
shares, basement Cannon’s only
triple, described her room as a bit
more cluttered than those of her
hallmates. “It’s not bad,” Oregon
said of her situation, noting that
while RLO provided extra furni-
ture, the room’s three inhabitants
will have to make do with closet
space for two.
