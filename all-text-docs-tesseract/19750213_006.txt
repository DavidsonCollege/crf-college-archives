Cesspool Boys

Blurping onto the music scene
like a rock thrown into a
cesspool is a group made up of
Davidson’s own sons--whom
you have no doubt heard on
several occasions around cam-
pus--a band that is redefining
the world of  music...a
band...whose name escapes me
at the moment. Give me a
second.

Anyway these guys_in-
corporate into their music
many of the experiences we
share here at Davidson.

Many songs on their latest
album ‘‘Lost in the Void’’ show
just what a krazy, kookie and
darn fun time we have here.

And these kids aren’t in-
tellectual lightweights, nossir.
Take for instance the sone ‘“‘I’m
a Humanities Being’, where
they blend Nietzchian dialectic
into a more communicable
message for us pioneers of
knowledge:

God is Dead
He sat on my tuna fish sandwich
1. blah blah blah

so on and so forth

...making this ole world of
books and things a little easier
to understand.

“The key to our songs are the
lyrics,’’ says one band member.
The boys feel they have really
found the meaning of life, and

try to communicate this

_ knowledge in their lyrics. Like

in the ‘‘Sex Life At Davidson”
number from their album,
another no nonsense song that
“Tells it like it is”. The song is
an instrumental, enhancing the
truth of its message.

Leading the group is guitar
player Bod Karma, who ex-
plained the band’s recording
history in a men’s room in-
terview:

“We made our first record on
the Oral Fixation label, a
division of Oral Roberts Inc. It
didn’t sell too well because the
hole in the center kept healing
over.”’

The guys have played at
many dances, and have been
praised for get down funky
rhythms. At a recent party both
people on the dance floor ex-
pressed hearty approval, and
asked what station the tran-
sistor was turned to. They
decided to dance together.

“Jiffie Jonnie Blues” ex-
presses the deep moral concern
the boys have for food. Ron

Scott, local food mogul and
scholar, was quoted as saying,
“T think this song captures the
essence of eating at Davidson.”’
(to the tune of Truck Driving
Man):

Well slap on another big ole
burger

With lots of grease an stuff bet-
ween (Wo buns

Pil puta nickel in the pay toilet
Cause it sure as hell gives me the
runs

“Our philosophy and outlook
on life comes from many
stimuli,’ said band member
Benjy Compson, lead hummer,
sometimes even what we hear
in class. I personally get a lot
from bathroom walls and bus
stations.”

The boys are all pretty fair
musicians, having followed the
bouncing ball for many years.
Another song on this album
shows how they use the
‘academic world here at David-
son to inspire high art. Blending
the sublime lyrical ennui of

Paul Anka with the grass roots
pragmatism of their professors,
they sing,

Having to flunk you.

What a lovely way

Of ripping off your tuition
Having to re-take

What a lovely thing

Till Tdon't give permission

The boys are quite an eclectic
band, and like Charles Ives
draw inspiration from the
sounds around them.

This fact is clear when you
look at their song titles: ‘‘My
Average is Better Than
Yours’’; ‘‘She’ll Do It At The
Drop of a Hat’’; “Don’t Take
That, He Makes You Think’’;
“I’m Engaged To a Pre-med’’;
and that all time favorite,
“Blind Date: Does She: or
Doesn't She?’’.

Chappy Smacker provides
steady rhythm for the group on
the tissue paper comb.

“Our performances are a
total theater experience now
that the heartbreak of csoriasis
struck my lips,’’ quips the
musician manque, struggling

Redefine Musical Limit

not to crack his smile.

And they’re all darn nice
guys, too, now that Chappy has
learned to stop slobbering when
he plays.

The boys are exemplary of
the synthesis of forms occuring

‘in modern music--the merging

of styles like rock-
jazzclassicalfunk, rhythm and
(pregnancy) blues, and raun-
chy classical. They add their
own brand to the list, sedimen-
tary rock.

“But don’t give us a label
man, we got fed up with Oral
Fixation’’, Says pianist
Allyoucan Swallow.

And in a special exclusive in-
terview these crazy kids told us
their favorite secrets, so here
they are for you to see, naked to
the world!

Chappy’s favorite things are
banana freeze pops, long hair,
and Jergen’s Lotion.

Allyoucan likes girls, black
beauties, and talking pot-
tymouth.

Bod likes spiked dog collars,
thigh length boots and amyl
nitrate.

Benjy likes his sister.

Happenings |

Linda Lovelace, the in-
ternationally known __por-
nography star, will perform un-
der the auspices of the In-

Wandering about, aimlessly, for a
stultifying six hours and ten minutes; so
lethargic it occasionally seems hardly to
move at all; pretentious to the point of
morbidity; the latest film by the prolific
Bupert R. Tarber, Jr., ‘Rape at OK
Corral’, is a masterpiece in negative
aesthetics.

Like so many of Tarber’s other films,

‘Rape at OK Corral” is a naturalistic

epic. It progresses--insofar as such a film
can be said to progress--through the slow
piling on of details.

Tarber’s pessimistic vision of Western
life requires that he show the ticks in dir-
ty, mated fur, the sweat on sunburnt
brows, the pimples on naked bums, a cow
stepping in.a bicket of its milk, a pig
wallowing in its vomit, a widow chewing
ona stick of excrement.

Due to a special process known as
“‘smellsurround’’, we are able to smell
these things as well as to see and to hear
them, and new heights in verisimilitude
are achieved.

Jumbled continuity, grainy prints and
other attributes of low-budget films give
perfect expression to the bleakness of
Tarber’s vision, a vision which allows for
little hope, less happiness.

The characters in Tarber’s films crawl
about like ants on darkling, windswept
plains. They are the pawns of ferocious

. gods, who at any moment might sweep

them out of Existence and into Whirling

. Pools of Nothingness. Lightning flashes,

insects buzz and dogs bark. Sometimes
life goes on, and sometimes it does not.
- Tarber seems to have wrenched ‘‘Rape
at OK Corral’’ from the furthest reaches
of his libido in a moment of pure,
unexampled lasciviousness and, in doing
So, has a film which squeaks
and screams with anguish.

The themes and methods of his
previous works-- the religiosity of ‘The
Viking Women and the Sea Serpent,”’ the

wit and sophistication of ‘‘The Diane
Linkletter Story’’, the social con-
sciousness of ‘‘Pornography and
Prostitution in the Ozarks’’, the
tastefulness of ‘‘Lust Cafe’’, the
animalism of ‘An Alligator Named
Daisy”’ anc
romanticism of ‘‘Nile Dusk” and ‘‘Born
to Be Dead’’--come together here to form
a complex tapestry, predominately
naturalistic, completely unorganized and
altogether sordid.

The film combines the mythology of
the Western according to John Ford and
the hard-core-porno-flick according to
Gerard Damiano; it is a brilliantine,
slow-motion consummation in the sky,
albeit a rathey bumpy one. ‘“‘Rape at OK
Corral”’ is Tarber’s ultimate statement.

The story line is deceptively simple at
first glance, but profound in allegorical
resonance. Butterfly Non-Placid (Holly
Woodlawn), a shy young maiden in her
late fifties, attends church with her 3
sisters and her mother, the Good Widow
Non-Placid.

They listen as Cyclone Mac delivers
himself of a deluge. Emerging with tears
in their eyes and spittle in their hair, they
scurry off to Prayer Training Class.
Class.

Finally alone in her room, Butterfly
stamps her foot, chews on ice cubes and
does strange things with a crucifix.

Allace! poor, poor Butterfly, still a
virgin at 58, and not a **** in sight. Hat-
ching a scheme that is sure to get her a
**** she retires, contented, to her sheets
and her dreams. ,

The next day, she ties herself and her
pet aardvark to the railroad tracks in the
middle of the merry town of Dodge city,
pop. 12. She waits. :

After many hours, and much wasted
screaming, The Knight With The Blood-
Red Plume (John ‘‘Long Johnny Wad"’
Holmes) strolls by.

‘‘Bambi Mated’’, the torrid ©

Cyclone Mac hears her wail, comes to
the rescue and rapes her thoroughly. In
her ecstacy, Butterfly accidently mur-
ders the reverend and, feeling pregnant,
rushed off into the desert to have a baby...

She settles on the top of the nearest
volcano, instinctively realizing that this
is the most melodramatic location for
birthing. As a neon cross flashes above,
and angelic sounds and smells pervade
the theater, Butterfly pushes a snake into
herself in the hope that it will bite and kill
the fetus.

Tragic catharsis is reached as the ell
snake bites Butterfly instead. She dies.

A wolf bitch happens to be passing by,
tears into Butterfly’s belly ad takes the
fetus, which happens to be twins, unto

herself. Thus, we see that although Tar- °

ber’s art is primarily pessimistic there
still shines a small ray of optimism.

As the film ends, a title announces
plans for a sequel, to be called ‘Tarzan
and Jane Regained...Sort of.’’ One might
well wonder how such a slender plot
could take six hours and ten minutes to
deveop.

Tarber, -I’m ‘afraid, believes in slow

motion and elaborate attention to detail.
‘‘Rape at OK Corral’’ is his most detailed
film, and unfortunately. his last. A few
hours after finishing the editing, Tarber
was run over by a Volkswagen.
“Rape at OK Corral’’ will be shown as
the ‘‘world-famous” Mooresville Art
Theater and Massage Parlor from Mar-
ch 11 to April 12. Showings will be con-
tinuous from 5 a.m. to midnight.

Escorted ladies and children under ten
will be admited free. Goseph Jardner,
who played the ardvaark and did the set
designs, will be on hand to sign
autographs during the: first day's

screenings. Look for him in the massage
parlor.
