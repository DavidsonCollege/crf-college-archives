In observing the-progress of the new eyiimasinum recent

of the needs, more courts must be whipped into shape. There
is no possibility of building new ones af the present time, so
the next best thing is to resurface 4he

We have only a vague idea of the cost ot

to improve the campus. Any Davidson team that can roll up
wins over schools of Duke, Georgia, Georgia Tech and come
within one match of downing the, North Carolina Tar Heels
for the state championship should get more than mrmor reco
nition, The same squad lost only Jerry Robinson from last
year’s combine and is destined to krjng Davidson into the na--
tional limelight in the next few years. With a team like that,
major tournaments are bound to be headed for ‘ole’ D. C. But
where will they be held? On three measly courts! Something
must he done and quick! We call for the students to get be-
behind a movement to put the four lower courts into the same
fine shape as the upper courts. As we said before, we don’t
know what this would cost, but it would be a drop in the
bucket to professional money raisers who are seéking two
and a half millions to improve this noble institution.

The new gym is rapidly going wp. If it were suddenly
realized that ten thousand needed for
completion, the powers that be would waste little time in
grabbing up the necessary amount. We feel that the imme-
diate relief of the tennis court situation is as pressing as the
completion of the gymnasium, if not more so, There will be
those who take issue to this. But the time to build or rebuild
the courts is now, and not next Spring, or after the gym is
finished and there is more money for them.

This column can holler all year for such improvements and
nothing will be done unless the students get behind the
movement. The student improvement committee appointed
by Dr, Cunningham to aid in raising the funds for improve-
ment should carry a good bit of weight in saying how that
money will be spent, If that committee would make such sug-
gestions as they deem necessary, we feel reasonably dure that
some action would be taken to relieve the situation,

more dollars were

The campus magazine possibly has a circulation in cer-
tain quarters where this publication does not reach. We in-
vite it to join us in, the campaign for the racket wielders.
We-can see no reason why member of the student body
should be opposed’ to improvement, but we'd like to hear any
comments, pro and con, on the issue. (We usually do hear
comments, mostly con, on anything we say, anyway). We
would be glad to print any open letter sent to us.
