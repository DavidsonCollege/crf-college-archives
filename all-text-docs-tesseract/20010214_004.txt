However, he did concede that “it may be hard
to explain [his po-
sition] to constitu-
ents”. Instead of
President Bush’s
broad tax cut,
Spratt supports
more moderate tax
cuts and an expan-
sion of the Earned
Income Tax
Credit.

Spratt also
vowed to direct his
legislative efforts
towards race rec-
onciliation, and in-
sisted that he
would vote for any
measure that out-
lawed racial profil-
ing. Furthermore,
he called on the
members of the
youngest genera-
tion to banish rac-
ism from society,
just as members of
older generations
had made slavery a “strange and unexplain-
able institution.”

When asked about the prohibitive costs of

Spratt opposes Bush’ s tax cuts.

campaigning for public office, Spratt charac-
terized campaign donations as “a form of
legal bribery.” He said that the current Con-
gress is working to reform the campaign
finance system, but stopped short of saying
whether he would support any of the current
measures (like the McCain-Feingold bill or
the President’s
more moderate re-
forms).

Spratt also de-
tailed the life of
public servants and
elected officials,
saying that most of
the American pub-
lic was unaware of
the financial hard-
ships of public of-
fice. He added that
he did not know of
any Congressman
“who got rich, le-
gally.” Represen-
tative Spratt added
that anyone aspir-
ing to hold elective
office should “fol-
low their dreams”
and “get involved
early.” He added
that his job “was
probably hard on
his family,” but
that his children
had said that his service had enabled to get the
best education possible.

DIA helps earthquake re-
lief in El Salvador, India

BY NIDHI PAUL
Special Contributor

On the 13" of January, an earthquake of
magnitude 7.6 hit El Salvador. There are over
700 people dead, and more than1200 miss-
ing. On the 26" of January, an earthquake of
magnitude 7.9 hit the northwestern part of
India. The latest count estimates that over
25,000 people are dead, with over 50,000 still
missing.

Two weeks ago the Davidson International
Association (DIA) and the Organization of
Latin American Students (OLAS) sponsored
arelief effort in Chambers. There was a table
set up on the. first floor of Chambers from
Tuesday to Friday, to collect donations to-
wards these countries. The effort was very
successful, with over $3500 collected.

Susana Rodriguez, the Service Chair for
DIA, organized the effort and was enthusias-
tic about the results. “The extent of the contri-
butions was inspiring. It is encouraging to
know that people are aware of these disasters,
and can work together to help out.”

The money collected for El Salvador will
go to Doctors Without Borders, a non-profit
medical relief agency. The money for India
will be given to the Red Cross fund for the
Indian earthquake.

If you would like to make a donation, and
have not had the opportunity, or have any
questions or concerns, please contact Susana
Rodriguez.

Grills

from page 1

questions about the problems with fire haz-
ards, cleanliness and expense. RLO is reluc-
tant to place grills near dormitories because
of the threat of fire. Upkeep and cleanliness is
also another factor. As Director of Residence
Life Kurt Holmes, said to Epps, “you cook,
you clean.” The proposed grills will most
likely be charcoal because they are easier to
maintain and clean than gas grills. The final,
and possibly most important issue facing the
SGA and RLO, is expense. SGA would pay
for the grills and physical plant staff workers
would install them. The addition of more
grills can only be a good thing for the eating
habits of Davidson’s student body. As
Rebecca Nunan ’03 remarked, “microwaves
can only take you so far.”
