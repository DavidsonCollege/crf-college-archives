with this work. According to
Telley, the play is especially in-
teresting because it illustrates
Shaw's idea of comedy.

“Shaw felt that a comedy
should do more than amuse the
wewer,’ Tilley said. “At this
tume he employed the form to

of basing one's life on illusion.”

Major Blantschli, the practical
professional soldier who feels
his work calls for him to duck
bullets more than seek them out,

will be played by English Pro-.

fessor J. R. Gross.

Sergius. the Bulgarian Baron,
is to be played by Bob Chun-

Professor Ratliff suggested
economic boycot? of segregat-

marized a number of other
peaceful, legal means to attain
the goal.

“This is a valid. effective
method of social protest and
ekould have as good a standing

sure, boycotts, political of a

omics professér Patterson. “It
violates no traditions or funda-

this country is based. Indeed, it

stated three criteria that should
be considered by potential par-
ticipants. First, “he should con-
sider his personal motives pret-
ty carefully. One should go in-
to something like this with an
educated conscience.” Secondly.
the student should consider the
consequences of his action and
whether he is willing and able
to bear them. Thirdly, a student
should carefully consider the
effect on his parents of his act,
discussing his participation in
picketing with them if neces-
sary when publicity of his ac-
tion might reach his home town.

mantic ideas about love, war,
and patriotism. The setting of
the play is the Servo-Bulgarian
War.

The action of the play begins

Army's. ranking officer from
combat. He climbs onto a veram
da which leads to the bedroom
of the daughter of the ranking
officer of the Bulgarian Army.
There the entire first act takes
place.

Tilley said the play seemed
ve be shaping up well in spite
of the short amount of time
that has been available to
work on it. Said Tilley, “I be-
lieve the spirit and talent
shown in preparing this play
prove that Davidson has the
necessary core for a success-
ful drama program next year.”

Tilley expressed his regret
in losing Buddy Brauch to the
army. “Buddy has done a fine
job for us in the past on sets
and lighting.” Due to Brauch’'s
absence Bill Denham will be in
charge of sets, and Chum Rob-
erts will take care of lighting.

Dr. Cliff Albergétti of the
physics department is in charge
of sound effects. Courtney Hill
who provided costumes for
“Androcles and the Lion” will
provide costumes for this play
also. —

The price of admission has
been reduced to 50c for the
general public and 25¢ for Dav-
idson students. Tilley wished to
express his appreciation for the
help the administration had giv-
en him in producing the play.
“They've really bent over back-
wards to help us out,” he said.

Honor Court and Student Coun-
cil learned of the numerous all-
night poker parties in which
participants win as much as
$35 per night.

Arbuckle brought the serious-
ness of the problem to the atten-
tion of the council, saying that
the problem had been discussed
at length at the first meeting of
the Honor Court. Arbuckle said
the gambling has not been limit-
ed to a certain group or frater-
nity, but by a combination of

groups.

The council tabled a motion
by John Killian to rescind the
faculty rule on gambling, which
states that an organized game
