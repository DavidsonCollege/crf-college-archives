BB and B return with info on everything

By BAD BERNARD AND
BONEHEAD

Shalom! Salaam! Bad Ber-
nard and Bonehead return from
Cairo to proclaim to all Ameri-
cans that the blossoming of the
flower of international peace
will culminate in the springtime
of brotherly love between our
friends Egypt and Israel.

There are’ several important
matters that need to be decided
in the immediate future. These
center around the fact that
Arab countries are protesting
the use of underarm stick. deo-
derant by Anwar Sadat. P.L.O.
Leader Yasser Arafat felt that
this was a symbolic gesture by
Egypt against the Arab coun-
like an Arab,’’ cried Yasser.
“We look at this as a threat to
the Arab League."

In order to simplify the
negotiations, BB and B have
appointed Skip Brown to the
post of Diplomat of Foreign
Peace. Skip has bowed to open
his heart to every man, woman,
and child and to kick the
natural hell out of these who
become dissident.

On our return flight from
Cairo, we stopped off at Para-
dise Island (just across the
bridge from Nassau) and Bernie
was able to mingle with the
Shah of Iran while Bonehead

played the one armed bandit at

a local casino. The Shah has
been holding a secret summit
with Notre Dame basketball
coach Digger Phelps to deter-
mine the cause of their respec-
tive losses. in the current year.
Bernie explained to them, “It
was meant to be.”

On the local political level,
there was a leak to Bonehead
that newly elected SGA Presi-
dent John Jackson planned to

use his victory merely as a

steppingstone to the papacy.
Jackson feels that it is time to
put an American white boy in

the Vatican and he cannot ra- .

tionalize waiting for an exten-
ded length of time to take
position.

**Besides,’’ said the future
Pope John John I, ‘'I have been
to Rome (Ga.) and I think being
pope is a damn important part

of my law school application.” —

Amen.

So much for politics. Now
let's mention something worth-
while. There are several matters
that we (as respectable journal-
ists) fell that we must bring to
your attention. a.

First, look above our article.
Did they: put one of those stupid

cartoons up there? We don't

mean to be disrespectable, but —

Second, two weeks ago we
wrote an article that was better
than it appeared, but parts were
edited by. our wonderful staff.
The only explanation for this
would be that they could not
understand what we wrote. This
is preposterous!

We write to make understand

of. Big dog firetruck excrescent_
