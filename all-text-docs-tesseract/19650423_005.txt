TENNIS AND THE SPRINGTIME

Traditionally nobody cares about college sports
in the springtime.

Oh, a few people always like to know how much
the baseball team got beat, or who the fools are run-
ning around the football field in their ‘“‘swing-easys,”
but generally like I said, nobody really cares about
college sports in the springtime.

But a change hes come. With a 17-1 record
(counting today’s win over Wofford) Coach Harry
Fogleman’s tennis team has suddenly begun to be
recognized through the shaded lenses of Davidson’s
traditionally sun-seeking and suds-soaking spring
student.

Four years ago Coach Fogleman came to David-
son, perenial loser in tennis (not to mention basket-
ball, football, track, baseball, etc., etc.).

“I told President Martin we’d have a winner in
three years and a conference champion in four,”
Fogleman beamed shortly before leaving with his
team for Atlanta: last Wednesday.

Last year Fogleman'’s first promise came true
when his third year’s team, predominately made up
of sophomores, posted an 18-6 mark.

This is Fogieman’s fourth year, and now the
second half of his promise is much more than what
might have once appeared to be a silly dream.

Once, when Cleveland was beating the Yankees
and the Giants played out of New York (remember?
eons ago), once Davidson was a tennis power. In
1954 and 1955 they won the Southern Conference
Tournament, but since then their fortunes have
skidded.

Eight of the past nine years a subsidized tennis
power George Washington has won the Southern
Conference title. The only break in their vice-like
grip on the championship cup was in 1961 when the
Citadel won.

This year looks different. George Washington
and the Citadel are strong, but we're stronger. Hav-
ing beaten the Citadel earlier this year and leading
George Washington before rain saved the Colonials,
things may well be different in Southern Conference
tennis play.

But first, still looming as threats to a possible
22-1 record are Duke and Wake Forest.

“We have never beaten Duke since I’ve been
here ,” Coach Fogleman remarked. “This should be
a good match; they beat us in a close one last year,
and they’ve got pretty much the same team back
again.”

Why such success? Coach Fogleman contends,
“We've got depth, that’s the mark of a good tennis
team.”

Both this depth and the youth of the team is
shown by a glance at the roster.

Jeff Frank, a junior, was last year’s number six
man, but this year he is number eight.

Jimmy Davis, Geordie Muelier, and Peter Par-
rott, all sophomores, play numbers seven, six, and
five positions, respectively.

Dick Hurd, a junior, is the number four man.
“He has gone down some in the order due to lack of
practice because of three labs a week”, Coach Fogle-
man lamented.

Bill Schutt, the captain, is the only senior on the
team. He played number one man last year, but now
he’s number three. “It’s not that he’s getting worse”.
Coach Fogleman remarked, “everybody else is just
getting better.”

Esmond Phelps, a sophomore, is the number
two man, “Phelps has the potential to be a really
good player,” Coach Fogleman added.

Bill Council, a junior, plays number one this
year. Coach Fogleman smiled, ‘‘Bill’s really doing
well for us.”

Next year should even be stronger for the 'Cat
netmen. Losing only number three man Schutt, they
pick up Woody Cleveland, on the Junior Year Abroad
Program now, who played number one man on his
freshman team with Council, Hurd, and Frank.

Besides Cleveland, Coach Fogleman expects to
get a great deal of help from this year’s undefeated
freshman team. Woody Faulk and “Pinky” Hatcher
both promise to be outstanding.

Ahead of next year, Fogleman has already be-
gun to build. ‘Steve Faulk, Woody’s brother, is the
best player we'll have had since I’ve been here,”
Fogleman reported. “He plans to enter Davidson
this fall.”

Tennis is a big sport here. The enthusiasm it

has generated with its outstanding records, its fine
coach, and its top-flight, non-subsidized players is

-Netters Keep Winning,

Take 3 More In Week

By STEVE BROWN
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Davidson’s tennis team

boosted their season record
to 16-1 yesterday with a 7-2
victory over Emory Univer-
sity in a match played at
Atlanta. The win, which ex-
tends the Wildcats’ winning
Streak to 11 straight. fol-

- lowed triumphs of 9-0 over

Guilford last Saturday and
of 6-3 over the University of

} Toledo Tuesday.

The team's record this year,
marred only by a loss to Rollins
College March 30, compares, ac-
cording to Coach Harry Fogle-
man, “rather favorably" with
last year's 12-4 standing at this
date.

Although the netters had little
difficulty with the visiting Guil-
ford team, with no match ex-
tending beyond two. sets, the
‘Cats’ second opponent last-week,
the University of Toledo, proved
tougher. ;

Said Fogleman, ‘That school
has a really fine team; their
coach is expecting them to win

the Middle America Conference
Tennis Championship, a win that
would be second only to the Big
Ten Championship.”

Fogleman went on to com-
ment, “Our main strength in
the Toledo match was in our
fourth, fifth, and sixth positions,
which he won without too much
trouble. Incidentally. the boys
who fill these positions — Peter
Parrott, Jimmy Davis, Geordie
Mueller, and Jeff Frank—are all
undefeated in singles play. Also,
Bill Council played fine tennis
for us, just the way he usually
does.

Hardballers Split With ECTC

By LARRY NORFLEET

Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson picked up one
win on the diamond last
week while dropping two
games on a split with East
Carolina and a loss to High
Point College.

East Carolina took Friday's
game with 15 round trips to
nine for Davidson. The Pirates
exploded for four big runs in
the first inning, and Davidson
never could catch up after that.

East Carolina tapped three
Dav:dson pitchers for 15 hits as
Dick Snyder got into trouble in
the seventh inning. Gene Ben-
nett came in in relief to retire
‘the other two batters, and then
Charles Elliott took over pitch-
ing duties for the rest of the
game.

a lot better.’ as Davidson scat-

two.

Davidson bounced back on
Saturday under the ace pitch-
ing of Howard Bryan to beat
off the Pirates 6-5.

Buddy Durham pitched four
innings but was replaced by
Bryan after giving up four runs.

East Carolina matched the
Wildcats in the hitting depart-
ment as each team picked up
twelve. Bryan added two singles
to his winning effort on the
‘mound, and Claude Owen, break-
ing into the line-up at first base,
went three for four at the plate.

Coach Stevens, in commenting
on the game, said, “This proves
that we can beat anybody on
a given day.”

But the ‘Cats bit the dust
again last Tuesday as High Point
College pushed past them 8-5
in error-filled playing.

Dave Johnson went the dis-

tance for the ‘Cats giving up 12
hits to account for the Panth-
er’s eight runs.

Only five of the eight were
earned runs due to eight errors
on the part of sloppy defense
by the ‘Cats.

Coach Stevens contended that

‘Johnson's pitching would have
been good enough to win except
for the errors.”

Davidson picked up 11 hits of
its own with Hyder, Snyder, and
Sonny Graves leading the attack
with two apiece.

Davidson faces two games
with Georgia Southern on the
23rd and 24th. In an earlier
mecting between the two, South-
ern swept both games.

header with V.P.I. on the 26th.
Davidson hasn't played V.P.I.

this season, but Coach Stevens
reported that “they have two
good pitchers, whom they will

probably start against us.”

April is a game at Chapel Hill
with U.N.C. Wednesday.

SONNY GRAVES
(Greatly Reduced)

This afternoon the Wildcats
take on Wofford College at Spar-
tanburg before heading into a
heavy schedule of three varsity
matches and a freshman contest
next week.

Monday, the netters will meet
VPI in a conference match here
at Davidson; Wednesday, the
‘Cats will take on Appalachian
at Boone; and Friday, the team
will return to Davidson for fresh-
man and varsity matches with
Wake Forest.

Fogleman commented, “Wake

Davidson Relays Cap

Forest will probably be the
toughest opponent out of these
teams; they have real good num-
ber one and two men. But of
course the VPI match will be a
conference outing, so we'll have
to be ready for that one.”
Fogleman added that out of
the matches remaining to be
played the Duke team should
give the Wildcats their strongest
challenge. ‘‘We've never defeat-
ed Duke since I've been here,”’
he said with a twinkle in his eye,
“but this might be the year!”

Frolics Sport Slate

The annual Davidson Relays, featuring track
and field teams from 16 Southern schools, high lights
the Spring Frolics sports schedule.

The Wildcat trackmen compete with strong

—

teams from Emory University, East Tennessee State,
and other North Carolina and Southern schools. The
’Cats are trying for a sixth consecutive win in the
annual meet.

Prospects are encouraging for another Wildcat
victory, according to Track Coach Heath Whittle.
“We should do very well and have an excellent
chance of winning,” commented Cocah Whittle, “al-
though East Tennessee is bringing a fine set of relay
teams and is the favorite because of their fast times
this spring.”

Coach Whittle said he felt his thinclads would
also be strongest in the relays, and that many rec-
ords will be broken in this year’s meet.

“The new scoring system we will be using makes
places in the relays more valuable than in field
events and should make the competition more in-
teresting,” Coach Whittle stated.

The distance medley relay team composed of
Ronnie Reese running the 440-yd. leg. Scott Sanford
the 880, Dennie Phillips the 3/4-mile, and Tommy
Heffner as anchor on the mile leg is expected to
make the best showing for the Wildcats.

Other relay teams will be:

440-yd. — Tom Watson, Steve Gill, Star Evins,
and Alan Turner;

880-yd. — Watson, Evins, Gill, and Turner;
1 mile — Watson, Reese, Gill, and Phillips;
Sprint Medley — Reese, Sanford, Phillips, Hef-
fner;

2 mile — Phillips, Heffner, John Barrow, and
Reese. :

In the field sports Jim Wallace, who won the
discus last year, should do well again and John Fagg
is to be counted on heavily in the discus and shot.
Other entrees in the field sports for the ’Cats are:

High Jump — Rufus Adair and David Brown;
Javelin — Bill Kendrick and Mike Thurman;
Broad Jump and Hop-Step-Jump — Brown and.
Lou Hill;

Coach Whittle concluded by saying “I expect a
good crowd, several broken records, and the best
meet yet.”

weather, IMAC softball mov-

The standings are beginning
to fall into piace, but the only
thing one can be sure of at.this
point is that there will be no

This week may have been the

Said a Crusader optimistical-

have beaten them worse if it
hadn't been for their shortstop
(Austin Letson):; he robbed us
of some good hits.”

The Sig Eps beat the Phi

sort of better seating arrangement should be found.

New, permanent bleachers would be a small
enough investment. With the coming prospects for
success, the Southern Conference Tournament being
held here again, and the Southern Junior Tourna-
ment held here again this summer, these bleachers
become aisnost a necessity.

“We have the best courts of any school we’ve

Wednesday.

He didn’t say so, but we've also probably got
the worst seats of any school he’s played.

We've also got the best team we've ever had,

When asked to comment on
the present goals of spring prac-
tice, Head Coach Homer Smith
elaborated, “Right now there
are two pressures on us. One

}is to work toward simplicity by

develcping the fundamentals.
The second is to establish an
offense and defense for next
year, especially for the benefit
of the rising seniors.”

Coach Smith mentioned two
plays in particular that the of-
fense has been working on. The
fullback carries the ball each
time in what he calls the belly
off tackle and the isolation plays.

Steve Smith is running at full-

back with Billy Taylor current-
ly working at quarterback.

Each practice session ends
with a series of grueling wind
sprints which separate’ the
“Burners” from the ““Comman-
dos’’. The latter group stays for
extra:‘work after practice.

Coach Smith singled out Tom-
my Caldwell as being the fastest
back on the team, along with
Woody Hill as the fastest in-
terior lineman.

Coach Smith concluded, ‘‘We
still have a lot to learn about
hustle, and we (the coaches)
still have a lot to teach in order
to accomplish our objectives.”
