Nationally Ranked
‘Cats Soccer Keeps

Winning

Just looking at the Davidson
men’ssoccer team’s 10-1. record is
impressive in itself, but it doesn’t
come close to describing all of the
team’s other accomplishments this
fall.

The Wildcats have defeated
teams suchas Duke and RIchmond

number four in the South. Even
more impressive than the southern
ranking is Davidson's ranking as
the twentieth best soccer team in
the nation in Division I.

This is the highest the Davidson
soccer team has ever been ranked. It
is also the first time in about twenty
years that any Davidson team has
been nationally ranked.

Just yesterday afternoon, the
team continued their impressive

- season with a 5-1 win over UNC-G.

The Wildcats completely outplayed
the UNC-G Spartans in a game that
was never close in the second half.
Before entering yesterday’s game,
the Spartans were undefeated with
an 8-0 record. UNC-G was also
ranked number one in the nation in
Division II, One of their victories

was over Clemson. The Tigers
are currently ranked number one
in the South and number four in
the nation.

Davidson was Iced by Rob
Ukrop who scored two goals in
Wednesday’s victory. Lance
Kinerk, Peter Cobb and Spider
Wormuth all scored one goal a
piece.

The Wildcats dominated
UNC-G in scoring more goals on

them in one game than the Spar-

tans had allowed in all of their
other games combined, Said for-
ward Glenn Smith, “We pulled
together and outplayed one of
the best team’s in the country, a
huge win.”

This past weekend the Wild-
cats were victorious over Fur-
man and the College of Char-
leston. The win over Furman
came in the firstovertime period
when Cobb scored on afreekick,
to give us the 1-0 victory. On
Sunday, Cobb scored twice and
Ukrop once, to give us a 3-1 win
over Charleston.

Coach Charlie Slagle has
now won 104 games in his ca-
reer. Slagle reached the 100 mark
over a week ago in Davidson’s
defeat of South Alabama.

The fan turnout continues to
be greatatall of the soccer games.
Although the team will not be
playing at home again, until Oc-
tober 13, they will travel just
down the road fora gameagainst
rival UNC-C on Sunday after-
noon at two. Before that, the
team plays at Appalachian State
on Friday.

We Believe! 'Cats Beat
Emory and Henry

By MATT JOHNES

The true character ofa football
team shows through when the going
gets topugh. If a team believes in
itself, it can overcome almost
anything. The Davidson Wildcats
believe, and last Saturday they
made believers out of Emory and
Henry witha hard-fought win. The

special.

Emory and Henry started off
the scoring with a 37 yard ficld
goal midway through the first
quarter, and on the ensuing kickoff
Davidson sct up shop at their own
43 after Bryn Robinson’s 40 yard
kickoff return. Six plays _ later,
Robinson ran for 16 yards and a
touchdown to give the Wildcats a

“Cats defense forced four turnovers —
and the offense racked up 464 total
yards in the 31-27 victory.

In the fourth quarter, when the
‘Cats needed itmost, they came up
with the big plays that win close
football teams. Hard-hitting de-
fense and the combination of quar-
terbacks Mark Wainwright and
Richard Howell led Davidson to
17 pointsin the quarter,and showed
that this year’s team is somcthing

6-3 lead. Drew Fasscit then booted —
through the first of his four extra
points. ,

The Wasps struck right back,
driving 81 yards for a touchdown.
Davidson lost the ball on downson
the next series, and Emory and
Henry started off from their own
26. But they didn’t get far against
the ‘Cats’ tenacious pass defense.

‘Cats Seek Fourth Win
Against Dickinson

Davidson, 3-1 after last week-
end’s stirring 31-27 victory over
Emory and Henry, journeys to
Carlisle, Pa. Saturday to confront
Dickinson.

. TheRed Devils should present
another stiff challenge to the Wild-
cats; they are 3-0, and overwhelmed
Georgetown 41-3 last week. Last
year Dickinson finished 9-1-1 and

“ won the Centennial Football Con-

ference championship.

This year, the Red Devils have
been simply overpowering, limit-
ing their three adversaries to an
average of just 120 yards per game.

_ Davidson head coach Dave
Fagg is understandably apprehen-
sive. “It looks like we’re going
right back into the frying pan,” he
said. “This could be our toughest
game.”
