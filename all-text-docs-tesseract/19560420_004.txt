“DICKIE” MOREHEAD, JOURNALIST, ETC.

Now Men, As ! See It...

A few days ago I was sitting in the Union, peacefully
pondering the oil slick on top of my coffee when my reverie
was abruptly interrupted by the approach of a number of
wildly gesticulating students. They were headed by a singular
character who appeared to be weighted down with a vest

pocket full of pencils and. note- ;
books. In ‘his hand, ‘he carried. a{ gave me a job writing ROTC news

in the Johnston gymnasium each
day from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The fraternities are sponsoring
the blood drive, and they will
be assisted by cadets and assigned
military personnel from the
ROTC department, as well as by
people from the community. Be-
ginning with this drive, there will
be an added incentive for full
participation by fraternities.

The Red Cross has donated a
plaque which will be given to the
fraternity having the highest per-
centage of donors. The fraternity
name will be engraved on the
plaque, and the plaque will be
kept by the fraternity winning it
for the preceding year. This
year’s presentation will be on the
basis of the Spring drive only,

KNOW YOUR COLLEGE

VITAL CAMPUS ROLE

By GERALD WILSON

The Davidson College Presby-
tertan Church has come to occupy

first, as a part of the college
plant, and secondly, as a symbol
of the principles upon which the
college was founded and which
have served as a guide to its poli-
cies. Thus, to some members of
the student body, the church is
the symbol of the things they
love about the college, while to
others, it. means quite a different
thing.

‘On June 24, 1837, the Davidson
College. “Church was organized by
the Concord Presbytery with
twenty-three charter members.
The organizational meeting closed
with the petition; “May the Lord.
bless this Church and multiply its
members, increase its usefulness,
and answer its prayers.” How
jealously the spirituality of the
church was guarded is shown in
an undated record sometime be-
tween June 1840 and September
1841. “A report having gained
credit that about Christmas of

ster and filled important pastor-
ates in three large southern cities)
had taken some part with a com-
pany of youths in dancing, the
session held an interview with
him in which he acknowledged
the crime, and professed in a
satisfactory manner, a feeling of
regret and repentance. His regu-
lar standing in the church was
therefore continued.”

War. In 1949 the groundbreaking

during the commencement week-
end on June 1, 1952, Dr. J. Me-
Dowell Richards, President of
Columbia Theological Seminary,
was the featured speaker for the
occasion. The Reverend Carl R.
Pritchett was at that time the
minister of the church, and re-
mained until succeeded by Dr.
Samuel Newell, Jr., in the winter
of 1953.

To many students making their
evening pilgrimage to the post
office there is no more impressive
sight than the cross on the steeple
silhouetted against the evening
sky. From the ground to the tip
of the cross is exactly 152 feet,
which coincidentially is the
length of the sanctuary. The build-
ing is of red brick and Indiana
limestone and is a mixture of
Colonial design blended with
features of the classical revival
period. The sanctuary of the

The pulpit is elaborately deco-
rated with symbolic objects such
as wheat representing the bread
of life and an olive branch rep-

The founders of the church
would be well satisfied that their
petition for the success of the
church has been fulfilled. Cer-

For the benefit of any students
who may be interested, the De-
partment of Mathematics is hav-

In preparation for this meet-
ing, a questionnaire was sent to
all departments at Davidson seek-
ing information along these lines.
Also, letters were written and re-
plies received from a good many
corporations and business con-
cerns. This could be a particularly
important meeting for any men
who have mathematical ability
and who have not decided on
their major field.

Any student who is interested
