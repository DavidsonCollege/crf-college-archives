DOWN THE SECEDERS

{

In spite of the loss to the Wolf-
pack Saturday, Coach McEver and
his assistants are not at all dis-
heartened over the showing of their
cohorts. Faced by a far heavier
aggregation, the Cats held their
ground amazingly well and were
outclassed only in the passing de-
partment. McEver is planning to
work on defense against aerials
during this week and to polish up
the offense.

Dame Rumor was spread abroad

the news about a. week ago that
Frank Purdy had lost another five

pounds and would probat
away to a shadow ina few
days. However, that same sl}
assumed tremendous proportions
the other night as it stopped State

at the center of the line. Sturdy

Jinx?

It seems that Memorial Stadium
in Greensboro is rapidly becoming
a jinx to the Wildcats. Last year
in the opening game of the season
Davidson played Duke almost to
a standstill there, but the Blue
Devils took advantage of a good
punt return by Honey Hackney
and a costly Cat fumble to score
twice and win, 13-0. This year State
eked out a victory by the narrowest
of margins.

Doc Newton:

Undaunted by their recent defeat at the hands of N. C. State,
the Wildcat varsity lines up, ready to take on the Seceders from

to be letting grass grow under their feet here, but don’t be deceived
—it’s only a pose. In the backfield are McClellan, Bolin, Dennis, and
Lafferty, while in the line are (left to right) Nicholson, Graham, Hill,

Coach Fort Depending On
Eight Winners

With eight regulars from last

looking forward to what is expect- |
ed to be a very successful season. |
Practice under Head Coach Leon- |
ard Fort and his assistant, Bobby |
Blue, has been going on for about
a week. |

At > present the biggest trouble |

seems to be the lack of competent |
reserves. The loss of Maurice Ham-

rick, promising guard, who went
out with a broken arm, will be sore- |
ly felt

Fort and Fidler, as ends, and |

either Washam or Farrington seems |
to be headed for a brilliant season. |

At tackle two big boys, Marion

; Cole and Ed Erwin seem to have |
} thes inside track. The guards are |

questionable, with Church and |
Gwynn probably getting the call, |
while Beadle and Fulcher will bat-

tle it out for the center post.

In the backfield Bill Wood — is |

back at the quarterback post, while

Gibson and R. Keener are back at |
|

the halves. Mike Gant, husky
new-comer, seems to have the mak-
ings of a fine fullback. Bud Broth-
ersford will make a strong bid for

one of the halfback jobs.

and dumb a week from Saturday
when we play the University of

be deaf and dumb the whole game,
becattse it'll be a miracle if we ever
go into the lead.”
