Victory [a ee

We have all rejoiced’ recently in the

news .of victory, but there has been an
undercurrent of solemnity which this age
has never before witnessed. On the cam-
pus, as all over the world, the defeat of
German has been the cause of much ser-
ious {hought—thought about the part of
the war yet to be won—thought about
the many hundreds of men who have
sacrificed their lives that we might con-
quer the forces of evil—and thought a-
bout the tremendous responsibility of this
nation in making the peace which will
foliow the cesssation of actual warfare.
The students of Davidson are conscious
of their part in this war and in the peace
to come, and this semester ends with:vows
- 6£ renewed efforts. *
Davidson is already feeling the ef-
fects of the victory in. Europe. Regis-
tration is increasing rapidly, and hopes
that post-war improvements will soon
start seem evident. However, the reali-

zation that the war in the Pacific i is not:

over is equally evident. There will be- ‘no
slacking of duty here, we are sure, and
the prospects for “rebuilding Davidson
loom large. As we have been told before,
we are seeing history being made, and

the opportunity which it gives us must.

not be ignored. Davidson j joins the world
in thanking God for the victory He has
given us, and in petitioning Him to give
us strength for thé tasks of the days which

—Hie ahead: —

Congratulations are in order for the

tation of the Mikado was indeed a notable.

event on the college calendar, and we are
confident that its success will do much
~ to keep the college’s reputation high in
music circles.

The students of Queens and David-
son deserve much credit for the work
which they did in this production. The
thours devoted to rehearsals meant the
sacrificing of study, and sleep, but every-
one cooperated to make it .a success.

The DAVIDSONIAN

- Editorials

c-

Perhaps the hardest working cpeople
were Mr. Pfohl and Mr. Berg. The or-
chestra did a fine job under Mr. Pfohl’s
able direction, and Mr. Berg not only did
all the directing of the stage production,
but also played the part of the Lord High
Executioner with excellent form.

The principal characters were well-
protrayed by the students, and Davidson
can justly be proud of this outstanding
musical performance.

Art Rollins was excellent in his role
of Nanki- Poo, and James Montgomery
did‘an outstanding job in the same role
in the Charlotte performances.

This is the last issue of the Davidson
for this semester. There have been many
trials during the year, and we regret that
there. have been instances in which the
paper could have served the students more -
capably. But it has been a good year for

all concerned, and we look forward to
bigger and better issues to come.

We remember the things that have
made this year a success for the Students
.., . Midwinters with a two-night ‘set
(even an orchestra for one night), and
with girls on Dormitory Row. . . Queens-
Davidson Days. . basketball games
under terrific handicaps. . . Spring Ser-
vices with Dr. Davis (particularly the
poolsroom sessions). . . . another Q-D
Day at Queens. Shakey and his mi-
raculous cure (We still don’t know who
killed him, but rumor points to a certain
college PT coach)... . Spring Frolics, the
segond dance being called off because of
the President’s death. . . Government In- '
spection of the R.O.T.C. unit (the weath-
er like mid-summer), . . week-ends at
Salem, Queens, et al... . rain, rain, rain,
. . the music clinic, with high school
girls “galore. May Day, all over the
state. Davidson students living in
town (for various reasons, mostly wet)

/ intramural sports all year long....
late sessions at the Stud. . :

All these little things remind us that
the year has gone quickly, and that it was
not ‘all work.

Now it is time to start again, this
time a concentrated period in symmer
school. New faces will appear; some of
us will not be back. There are new of-
ficers in the student body—to them we .
extend our congratulations and services
insofar as we are needed.

To our two graduates we bid fare-
well, and look to them for leadership as
alumni. We are particularly grateful to
“Doc” for his invaluable assistance on
the paper, and we looR-with pride on his
outstanding scholarship record.

The Editor wishes to thank the en-
tire staff for their cooperation in putting
"out the paper, forthe fun we had, and
~ for the.excellent work which they “havé
done. Hil Masters, Bruce Fisher, and Art
Rollins have been with us until the wee
small dnes more than once—none of them
return next year, and we thank them for
their tircless efforts.”

The business staff deserves much
credit for its work in getting ads and
circulating the paper, too. Thanks!

To the new staff, whoever they may
be, we extend best wishes. Editor Win-
stead and Manager Lazenby, we look for
a bigger and better Davidsonian to help
build a bigger and better Davidson!

With thoughts of the past year in.
our minds, and hopes for the future in’
our hearts, we sign our last “thirty”.

ed set-up will have no worry at
all, for he’s all “wings”.

This summer will be a very bright
sight on the campus of Davidson
with all the pretty little co-eds who
plan to atténd here this summer.

our boys might even be remodeled. ”
Well, as this year comes to a close,
this column must do the same. 1

The reawkening of the too long
dormant Le Circle Francis will also
be connected with this year. Dr.
‘Watts and his classes produced two
excellent ‘French plays and they
were given at Queens and Winston
Salem as well as at Davidson.

The informative chapel talks made
by Dr. Frontis Johnston are so:me-
thing that made this year more
outstanding than others, His specch-
es concerned a summary of the lives:
of great presidents, on their birth-
days. He took in to consideration
Washington Lincoln, Jefferson, and
the late Franklin D. Roosevelt at
the time of his death. Dr. Johnston
was received each time by the en-
tire student assembly: and the many
people from the community, plus
the faculty members, ;

It was this year that our beloved
president died. He, was grieved: by
all and the latter thie of the spring
dances were wisely called off to
observe the mourning. He was the
thirty-second president of these
United States, and to many of us
the only one that we rentember.

It was. also this year that the
boys in Rumple felt the urge to
convert the steps into a Waterfall
by plugging up the shower drain.
Some of the boys on the second
‘floor of Georgia didn’t do so bad
with windows, cither. Naturally, they

-were excluded frdm the dormitories,
against O.PLA, regulations, for ‘they

had already paid their rent. ~

Probably the most important—
thitig that happened during this
school year was the war ending in
Europe. With that done we may
now concentrate on Japan. .

I could go on and list many things
as “Doc” Hollinger becoming Phi
Bate, Blain getting engaged (suck-
er), qnd other things, but I won't.
Since this is my last €olumn for ye
‘olde “Davidson” I will only say that
it has been a pleasure to write for
you (even though you didn’t read
Ht), It’s been 4 pleasure.
