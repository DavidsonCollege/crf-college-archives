Coffee Houses Expand,
Employ Fresh Talent

By MARVIN ELLISON
Staff Writer

Realizing the need for good en-
-terlainment on campus, schools
across the country are joining
the college coffee house circuit,
which began last year at David-
son.

“This idea has been with C.
Shaw Smith for a good while.”
commented Peter Parrott, Col-
lege Union president.

“Working on the premise that
good talent does not mean neces-
sarily expensive talent, we con-
sistently get good performers
while these new names have the
chance to play audiences around
the country."’ Parrott continued.

Before Smith, director of the
Union, began to work out details
for the circuit two years ago. he
realized that good talent could
be booked for reasonable fees,
but also that the students them.
selves would have to generate
interest on campus for these per-
formers.

Although few agents or man-
agers offered encouragement at
the Block Booking Conference in
Raleigh in December, Smith de-
cided to go ahead with the idea.

Fred Smoot. a comedian with-
out a big name, appeared sev-
eral times at Davidson's hungry
d last spring. and the enthusi-
astic response he received en-
couraged Smith to find other
schools to join the circuit.

“Since Fred Smoot opened the
hungry d,"" Parrot said. “eight
colleges have joined in with us,

and more than 40 others have
shown definite interest.”

Fred Winetraub, manager of
the Bitter End in New York,
“screened nine acts for a group
of college representatives who
went to New York last summer
to see the talent and work out a
tentative ‘circuit’,”” Smith add-
ed, and “the idea has caught on
tremendously.”’

Jake Holmes, at the hungry d
last week, was the first act on
the circuit this year and has
played three of the eight partic-
ipating colleges and universi-
ties.

After performing at Duke.
Holmes has been asked to play
in concert there for their ‘Joe
College’’ weekend this spring.
Steve Gillette, who has sung
with Ian and Silvia, will be at
Davidson later this year.

Smith remarked that ‘schools
have been making inquiries, and
the agents, once opposed to the
idea, are now writing to add
more talent to the circuit.”

“With the support of the stu-
dents,"’ Parrott commented, ‘'we
hope that this new way of bring-

ing entertainment to the campus] ‘ :

will develop more and more.”

YRC Asks
Be Put In

A committee from the Young
Republicans Club has been ap-
pointed to talk with the admin-
istration about whether and
when an American flag should
be displayed in Love Auditor-
ium.

The committee, appointed by
President Joe Beard, is headed
by freshman Bill Schaffer. Ac-
cording to Beard, no action has
been taken by the committee and
none is anticipated by him until
the controversy of the American
flag in the Feb. 8 chapel hus
subsided.

Beard also commented that

That Flag
Auditorium

the putting up of that flag ‘‘had
nothing to do with the YRC.”
The action was taken by hin-
self and another student, Ron
Dougherty, who is not a mem-
ber of the YRC..

Though the club was not re-
sponsible for this action, Beard

stated that the general senti-j '

ment of the club was that there
“should be a flag up there all
the time as there is in all audi-
toriums."’ This was the reason
for the creation of the commit-
tee and for the appropriation of
$50 by the club to purchase a
permanent flag and flag-holder,
he explained.

The debate over the use of
LSD continues on numerous col-
lege campuses, and it takes
place on many different levels.
One. aspect of the LSD contro-

|| versy is the drug's supposed

ability to provide religious ex-
perience.

Timothy Leary. one of the
early researchers on LSD at
Harvard University. has found-
ed a religious cult based on the
drug experience. He calls it the
League for Spiritual Discovery
(LSD).

Speaking last week at the Uni-
versity of Oregon, Leary sug-
gested, ‘‘When you turn on...
you go... ..out of your mind.
And when you go out of your
mind, you come to your senses,
you resurrect your body, you
discover that you are two billion
years old.”

In this manner, Leary, who
was dismissed from Harvard for
his drug experiments, said, the
individual who takes LSD is
linking himself with the stream
of life since the beginning of ex-
istence.

During a mid-January speech
at Stanford University, Leary
advised students to found their
own LSD-based religion. ‘“‘Every-
one of us have to be his own
Moses. his .own Galileo, and
work out his own system with
Caesar,"" Leary stated. “The
kingdom of God is within your
own body.”

Another January speaker at
Stanford, Dr. Allen Cohen of the
University of California at
Berkeley, disagreed with Leary's
analysis of LSD’s spiritual pow-
ers. Cohen. who at one time
worked with Leary, charged that

LSD is a “fake.”

A 30-time user of the drug.
Cohen claimed LSD ‘‘did not de-
velop me spiritually and had no
application to everyday life.’
Cohen said the drug. which he
stopped taking a year and a half
ago. leads to “spiritual egotism
with users extending egos rather
than transcending them.”’

Another debate over LSD cen-
ters around its reported ability
to stimulate creativity. A Stan-
ford University study by Drs.
Willis Harman and James Fadi-
man reported recently that.
“given appropriate conditions,
the psychedelic agents can be
employed to enhance any aspect
of mental performance.”

The subjects of the experiment
produced a new conceptual
model of a photon. a design of a
linear electron accelerator beam
steering device. a mathematical
theorem regarding NOR-gate
circuits and several innovations
in architecture and design.

The report states. “‘The psy-
chedelics appear to temporarily
inhibit censors which ordinarily
limit the mental contents coming
into conscious awareness."

AFTER-EFFECTS

A study by John C. Lilly of the
Communication Research Insti-
tute. Miami. claims that LSD
frees man's ‘‘human computer”
from. many limitations. The
study suggests that LSD gives
individuals the opportunity to
look at themselves comprehen-
sively, allowing for serious intro-
spection not normally possible.

Other reports disagree with
these findings. and there is a
conflict over the side effects of
LSD use as well.

Food and Drug Administra-
tion officials claim that at least

Williams’ Art Appears
In Raleigh Exhibition

Among the contributions to the
29th Annual North Carolina Art-
ists Exhibition held recently in,
Raleigh were two works by Rob-
ert Williams, instructor of Fine
Arts at Davidson.

Earlier Williams had been
selected to receive the North
Carolina State Art Society Pur-
chase Award for his print entitl-
ed “Poem.”

received his BA and MA degrees
from the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hili before
becoming an instructor at Da-
vidson.

In addition to his most recent
exhibition, his paintings have
been shown in past North Caro-

a

As a result of the award, he
was requested to show two works
not previously exhibited at the
North Carolina Museum of Art.
where the annual exhibition is
held.

The first chosen by Williams
was a painting done in acrylic,
a new plastic media. The name
of the painting, ‘'3056-2,"" comes
from the numbers stenciled onto
one unit of the painting in which
the artist attempted to show
growth as a progression from
one cell to another.

five per cent of individuals us-
ing LSD experience serious psy-
chological after-effects. Esti-
mates from other sources range
upward from one per cent. The
question is battled over in a
number of journals and theoreti-
cal papers published in recent
months.

A draft of an unpublished
study done recently at a large
Midwestern university com-
ments, ‘Scientists measure and
have explanations for the actions
of many drugs on such observa-
ble indices as the heart and res-
piratory rates, the level of var-
fous chemicals in the blood and
the secretion of enzymes.

“In contrast, the subjective
changes produced by a drug can
be ascertained only by asking
the subject. in one way or an.
other, how he feels.”

The report states. “To be
sure, one can measure the drug's
effect on certain measures of
psychological functioning — the
ability to perform some. stan-
dardized task. such as placing
pegs in a board or remembering
nonsense syllables—but this does
not tell us what the drug ex-
perience is like.”

Drug psychoses, the unpub.
lished study says. muy arise
from the definition by a user of
certain unusual symptoms the
individual chooses to associate
with his. drug use.

The individual may interpret
these symptoms “‘to mean that
he has lost his grip on reality,
his control of himself. and has in
fact ‘gone crazy’."’ At that time.
the report suggests. “the drug
experience, perhaps originally
intended as a momentary enter-
tainment . . . looms as a mo-
mentous event which will dis-
rupt one’s life in a possibly per-
manent way.”

The report suggests that
“faced with this conclusion, the
person develops a full-blown anx-
iety attack any psychiatrist will
certify as a psychotic episode."

William H. McGlothlin of the
University of Southern Californ-
ia’s psychiatry department re-
ported in a recent seminar that
“there is some tendency for per-
sons scoring high on (tests of)
aesthetic sensitivity to have
more intense and insightful LSD
reactions and to be less threat-
ened."

REACTIONS

McGlothlin'’s report also sug-
gests that ‘“‘persons who report
naturally occurring hypnotic-
like experiences, are oriented
toward ideas and intuition. and
prefer to live an unstructured
life, tend to react more strongly
to LSD. Those who prefer a more
practical and orderly life tend
to have less intense reactions.”

The McGlothlin report, pre-
sented at a meeting of the
American Psychological Associa-
tion (APA). notes that LSD
users describe their experience
most frequently in. terms of
“greater appreciation of music
and enhanced understanding of
self and others.”

ticipants in the LSD experiment

PIZZA aad SPAGHETTI

The Pavidsanian February 17, 1967 Page Three

reported that their drug exper-
iences had some lasting effect.
These subjects had been given
200 mcg. of LSD on three sep-
arate occasions.

Nearly one-third of the group
reported ‘‘various personality
and attitude changes such as
decreased anxiety, a less mater-
ialistic viewpoint. and greater
introspection and tolerance.”’

These reports have prompted
some federal action on the part
of the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA). Dr. James L.
Goddard revealed this week that
college students trying to ‘turn
on, tune in. and drop out’’ have
unwanted company.

Goddard is the commissioner
of the FDA, and the unwelcome
visitors to the campus LSD scene
are the 200 agents of FDA's
Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.
The FDA agents, posing as stu-
dents, are buying LSD, amphet-
amines, and other drugs at an
unknown number of — schools
throughout the nation.

The FDA commissioner's
statement this week was in line
with a letter he sent to. 2000 col-
lege deans on April 5, 1966 in
which he warned of “‘the gravity
of the situation’’ and. asked for
the assistance of academic ad
ministrators “in combatting an
insidious and dangerous activi-
ty." .

TO REPORT

. Goddard asked that ‘‘any in.
stances of the illegal use or pos-
session (of LSD and ampheta-
mines) should be reported at
once to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration district office.’ He
advised university officials to
“send us any questions you may
have which will aid in eliminat-
ing the illegal use of hallucino-
genic and stimulant drugs.”

Although FDA officials claim
they are primarily interested in
finding illegal sources of drug
supply rather than finding in-
dividual users, they admit to
cooperating with local law en-
forcement officiaJs in geographi-
cal areas where possession of
such drugs violates local law.

Federal statute prohibits the
sale of LSD, but possession for
individual use is not a criminal
act. FDA's agents, however, are
authorized to use ‘executive sei-
zure’’ in confiscating LSD under
the provisions of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Amendments of 1965.

Seizure is permissible because
LSD, lacking FDA approval. is
not in “‘lega) distribution."’ After

LSD Controversy Continues;
Religious Significance Sought

20 years of research, it’ is still
classified as an ‘‘investigatory
new drug.”

Some FDA agents have been
specially trained at the Universi-
ty of California at Berkeley's
School of Criminology. There,
the agents are taught law, tech-
niques of enforcement, crimino-.
logy and corrections, drugs, phy-
sical evidence. accounting and
auditing, weapons training. phy-
sical conditioning and use of
vehicles. (A recent U.S. Senate
report indicates the largest num-
ber of LSD users at any school
exists at Berkeley. The report
attributed 2500 LSD users to the
Berkeley campus.)

While Goddard's agents were
looking about the campus, the
debate over the implications of

‘LSD use continued at many col-

leges. At others. administrators
were taking independent action
against student drug use.
HAVERFORD

Haverford College president
Hugh Borton told students that
they faced possible suspension
for repeated drug use. Borton
said drug use is “largely social-
ly unacceptable and hence puts
the good name of the college in
jeopardy.’’ He said Haverford
would cooperate avith all law en-
forcement agencies ‘‘as a mat-
ter of policy.”

Amherst College's Committee
on Guidance and Counseling
mailed a letter to the student
body indicating the school's
‘concern about the use of drugs
because of possible physical and
psychological dangers and dam-
aging effects to the individual
user."" An Amherst official de-
scribed the purpose of the letter
as “purely educational and infor-
mational."’

Students at Amherst ‘desiring
further information. or wishing
to discuss confidentially the im-
plications of drug use. are en-
couraged to visit the Counseling
Center or the Student Health
Office.’'

The letter included a discus-
sion of federal and state laws
governing drug use and gave a
brief discussion of the effects of
LSD and marijuana. A college
official described the school's
policy toward the individual drug
used as ‘‘flexible.”

Perhaps the strongest position
against LSD use is taken by the
University of Maine. That insti-
tution’s handbook states that all
students involved in the use of
hallucinogens will be dismissed
from the university.
