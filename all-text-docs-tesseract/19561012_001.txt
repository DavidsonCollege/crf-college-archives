ON EXPERIMENTAL BASIS

Humanities 13-14 Offers
Challenge to Students

This semester Davidson College offers for the first time
Humanities 13-14 as part of its curriculum. The course ex-

amines some of the basic ideals of Western culture as they|

appeared in selected masterpieces of European and American

literature.

To develop a course in the hu-
manities and to provide a challenge
to the increasing number of stu-
dents entering Davidson College
well prepared in techniques of
form and usage are its dual pur-
poses.

Tn the trial period enrollment is
limited primarily to freshmen. Be-
cause of the emphasis on discus-|
sion, the size of the class is also
small. ‘

STUDENTS COMPETE

Students of the course were
chosen on a competitive basis. High
proficiency demonstrated on the
verbal section of the College En-
trance Board tests enabled twenty-
five men to qualify for a further
examination.

Four members of the English de-
partment reviewed the results of
this examination, a compositional
one devised by the College En-
trance Board.

Effectiveness in use of English,
grammatical proficiency, and abili-
ty to analyze and interpret selected
readings determined the thirteen
men who composc the class.

DIFFICULT CHOICE

“Selection was difficult,” stated
Dr. W. P. Cumming. Dr. Cumming’s
offort and energy are largely re-
sponsible for the installation of the
course.

Concepts of honor, glory, love,
and justice in the culture of the
West present the theme of study

Rhodes Scholarship
interviews Scheduled

Students who wish to apply for
Rhodes Scholarships should see
Dr. W. P. Cumming, the represent-
ative for the Rhodes Scholarship
Committee at Davidson College.

The Rhodes Trust requires that’
a candidate obtain a written en-
dorsement from his college be-
fore applying to the State Com-
mittee of Selection. Applications
should be sent in as early as pos-
sible in October.

Because of the numerous affi-
davits and letters of recommenda-
tion required, a student expecting
to apply to any of the major
scholarship committees should ob-
tain the necessary blanks and re-
quest the approval of the David-
son College Graduate Scholarship
Committee by the middle of Octo-
ber.

for the year. Among the works
through which these ideals will be
examined are Homer's Iliad, Cer-
vantes’ Don Quixote, Plato’s Sympo-
sium, and Dante’s Divine Comedy.

Dr. Cumming also plans to use
William Faulkner’s Absalom,’ Absa-
lom, Sophocles’ Oedipus Cycle, Tol-
stoy’s Anna Karenina, and. other
works of equal stature.

Since major aspects of Western
civilization first appeared among
the Greeks, the course began with
the study of the Miad.

“From the Greeks stem our cul-
ture and our basic institutions,
such as democracy, philosophy,
drama and poetry,” explained Dr.
Cumming.

LISTED TWICE

The Davidson College Catologue
(1956-37) lists the course twice. The
department of English includes it
as English 13-14, an advanced fresh-
man composition course. As an up-
per class elective course it appears
as Humanities 13-14, with no de-
partmental ties.

Suez Crisis Effects
Discussed By Ford

Dr. Harold. P. Ford spoke on
“The Economic and Political Ef-
fects of the Suez Canal Crisis” at
a meeting of the Business-Eco-
nomic Association in the Green
Room of the College Union Tuesday
night.

Dr. Ford traced the events lead-
ing up to the precipitation of the
canal crisis, first pointing out how
Britain bought out interest in the
Canal Company.

“America has taken a middle-
of-the-road policy towards the cri-
sis,” Ford noted, “ever since Nas-
ser nationalized the canal in
August.” He further explained how
a policy of this kind. affects the
United States’ relations with her
allies. “The U. S.,” he said, “wants
good relations with her close allies,
France and Britain, but, at the
same time, doesn’t want to offend
Nasser ‘and other leaders in the
Arab world.”

In discussing the crisis’ effect

‘on Russia. Dr. Ford declared that

the Soviets, although they have
sent arms to Egypt, are; for the
most part “sitting back and watch-
ing.”

A question and answer period
followed the talk.

the Davidson delegation. Anyone

vention should contact him and

ing as a delegate or alternate dele-
gate.

FRESHMEN REQUESTS

Freshman adviser Carl Cooper
reported that brothers from some
fraternities have ordered their
pledges to do things contrary to
regulations of the Court of Con-

trol. This has confused these fresh-
men about what to do. The Stu-
dent Council stressed that fra-
ternities impress brothers with
the fact that the Court regulations
are still in effect.

The Freshman Council also re-
quested a Coke machine for West
Dormitory, with student directories
and telephones on each floor of
the freshman dormitories. They al-
so wanted to know more of the de-
tails concerning Homecoming, such
as finances and arrangement of
places to stay for their dates.

RIOT

There was sonte discussion about
the riot Wednesday night of last
week. Reitzel Snider, Judge of the
Court of Control, said that upper-
classmen were treading on fresh-
man grounds at their own risk.
President Dan LaFar said it was
the duty of the Council to be at
riots. He ;also commented that
school spirit was not exceptional
at the pep rally before the P. C.
game last Saturday.

The gold woven wreath, which
Measures one and one quarter

Begins Late This Month

Project Is Scheduled

For Television Showing

“The Story of Davidson” and the liberal arts education
offered here will be featured in a motion picture slated for
television presentation, with work to begin late this month.

Davidson has been selected as
the first college. to be featured in
a series of motion pictures of.
church-related colleges in the
United States, The series, which

jwilt be called “Banners of Free-

dom," is being sponsored by the
interdenominational Protestant
and Television Center of
Atlanta in an effort to show that
contributions have been and are
being made by church-related pri-
vate calleges.

The movies of Davidson, which
will comprise the pilot film of the
series, are intended to be released
to television stations all over the
United States.

The entire project is still in the
planning stage. During the past
month several conferences has de-
veloped here at Davidson and at
the Center in Atlanta between. Dr.
Cunningham and other Davidson
College. officials and officials of
the Center.

Dr. Ernest J. Arnold, former As-
sistant to the President at David-
‘son, is the Vice-President of the
Center. To write and direct this
series, the Center has hired George
P. Gunn, who has had a long career
in; radio. the theater, and televis-
ion. Gunn. a graduate of .the Uni-
versity of Florida, is a former ABC
network announcer and, before his
employment by the Center in Sep-
tember. was a free-lance actor and
announcer in New York.

STARTS THIS MONTH

The Center hopes to begin actual
shooting of seenes at Davidson by
late October even though. the
script has not yet been written.
The 30-minute film will be = dra-
matic and will attempt to gain
and hold the national T.V. audi-
ence, but will also strive to be
accurate i

son and the program here.

The filming, which will be both
color and black and white, will be
shown on T.V. in the nature of a
public service program.

Gunn and J. A. Brown, a techni-
cian in lighting and camera work
at the Center were here on Octo-
ber 5. Brown inspected the campus
and found that almost ail the build-
ings are electrically suited for
the production of the filming.

It is the purpose of Davidson
in joining the Banners of Freedom
motion picture series to accom-
plish several objectives. Generally,
it is Davidson's intent to show the
place of the church-related private
college to as many persdns as pos-
sible.

In addition to this overall ob-
jective. Davidson should also hope
to enhance the academic. prestige
of the college on a national level,
attract worthy students to the col-
lege, and gain, at least indirectly,
support for the college program,
financial and otherwise.

A significant. aspect. of the. Da-
vidson College education which
might well be brought into the
film is the four-part program of
the Christian college: intell-ctual,
spiritual, physical, and social. The
individual student is encouraged to
develop in each of these ways.

If the project achieves maxi-
mum success, that is, if all tele-
vision stations, solicited agree to
show the film, it is possible that
more “people will learn about Da-
vidson College than have known
about it since its founding in 1837.

The national television audience
is better than three-fourths of the
entire population. and it is ‘con-
ceivable that the film could be
shown to armed forces and to tele-
vision stations in countries all over

n its depicting of David-ithe world.
