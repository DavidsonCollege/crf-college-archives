What in the heck is a Doughboy?

By THE BRICK BROTHERS
AND THE DOUGHBOYS
Egad, IMAC fans, the Brick

Brothers are back for another
exciting season and so are you.
We're sporting a new look this
year since our erstwhile partner
in crime, Bonehead has left us
for a fulfilling career in the
rehabilitation of peripatetic oc-
tagenarians. However, do not
despair loyal fans, for we have
chosen two anaclitic and corpu-
lent youths from a raunchy
little Virginia town to replace
our departed comrade. These
fellows got this highly desirable
position by fulfilling 3 simple
criteria: 1) They both hate
Ronald Reagan, 2) neither is a
KA, 3) both are funny. The last
two are of course mutually
exclusive. Being that the KA
era has ended, it seems likely
that that despicable fraternity
will join the SPE’s as the
principle targets of our justifia-
ble wrath. The chance that the
KA’s will escapeg§ur wrath is
roughly equivagn' to the
chance that Joby finds a cure
for cancer. Anyway, the key is
that the Doughboys have joined
the Brick Brothers in the hal-
lowed halls of IMACdom.
Now, moving along, we know
that the summer has rusted
your cranial matter to the point
of no return. So we have devised
a simple and scientifically ap-
proved test to hone your analyt-
ical skills. Here is your ticket to
