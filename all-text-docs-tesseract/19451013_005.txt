The Davidson
Freshmen had fire
in their eyes when
they ran against the
Appalachian fresh-
men last Saturday,
but that didn’t seem
to be enough to ob-
tain a lead over the
Mountaineers in.,
Mountaineers in
scoring. It was a
well fought game
with every man do-
ing -his-part for the
Wildcats.

The Davidson
beys had to defend their own round during the first half
of the opening period, but it wasn’t long before hard
blocking and driving brought results, and the ball was
then kept down in Appalachian’s territory. The Wildcats’
second-string then took over at the second quarter and
battled it out to the half time period with the score still 0-0.

The first string boys went in with renewed spirit
after the half, and fought hard trying to reach the pay
dirt. With Dave Neill throwing and Bill Iverson catching
the freshmen picked up 53 yards by passing alone. Page
Jackson also did some swell receiving which added 24 more
yards to our passing offense. Even with our passing drive
we were unable to get over the ‘“G”’ stripe before the third
heat ended.

Even though Ward Lasley, fullback, was unable to
pratice the three days before the game due to a foot in-
jury, he played as if he had been in top form all along,
and orchids go to him for racking up our only touchdown.
Shortly after the Mountaineers made their score he, to-
gether with Henry Floyd, drove the ball down to the Ap-
palachian 17 yard line and he finashed off the remaining
yardage in an off tackle play.

Herb Waldrop had the game tied up in his shoe laces
until he booted the ball squarely between the goal posts
to make a perfect conversion.

The remaining minutes of the game were spent in a
passing duel, and the final whistle left the game in a 7-7
tie.

After playing a bang-up ball game from his guard
spot Captain Bill McLean was forced to retire from the
game due to a fractured colar bone which he received dur-
ing the third quarter. Bill played five plays after he re-
ceived the injury before leaving the field. The team will
really miss Bill in its coming games, and hopes he will
have a speedy recovery.

Beta PIKAs

Neither the ariel of Coble and
Ensign of the PIKAs nor thatof
Stukes and Keith of the Betas could
show either team superior as the
two squads battled to a scoreless tie
on the. second day of-intra-mural
football. An extra period also failed
to offset this knot, Sudsie Smith’s
play was faultless, defensively and
offensively.

Here Saturday

Lasley And Floyd Spark Drive;
McLean Injured

Last Saturday on Richardson Field
the Davidson game of the season’
met the Appalachian freshmen to
battle to a 7-7 tie.

The Cabbage-eaters had a slight
advantage
but the Kittens held their own in

weight over Davidson,
the line both defensively and of-
fensively, and fought hard to over-
come the handicap.

When Appalachian played a five
man line defense against Davidson,
it slowed up the Kittens consider-
ably until they were able to work
out a system to meet them.

The first half ended scor€less
even though both teams struggled
hard to score.

Real fire and action was seen in
the final quarter when Donahoo
and Ashburne of Appalachian start-

ed a. drive against the Kittens.
Donahoo finally made the score,

and Boyette kicked the extra point
by placement.

After the Mountaineers kicked
off Davidson started its—big push
forward to score, and reached pay
dirt after a 60 yard sparking drive
made by Lasley and Floyd. Lasley
lugged the ball over in a final 17
yard run, and Waldrop converted
for the tieing point.
