Soccer looks for answers to losing skid

By- PERRY MATHEWES

The Davidson soccer team lost
both of their games this week to
drop their record to 1-7-1. They
lost Z-0-to William and Mary last
Saturday, then Appalachian State
nipped them 1-0 in Boone
Wednesday night.

The William and Mary game
started poorly for the Wildcats.
The team played with “‘no inten-
sity for the first 15 minutes and the
last 15 minutes of the first half,”
coach Charlie Slagle said. Unfor-
tunately the William and Mary
goals both came in those last 15
minutes of the first half.

In the second half Davidson
played much better, holding their
own against the Tribe. The im-
proved play, however, came too
late for the Wildcats to make a
comeback. ~

The Appalachian State game
was much more frustrating for the
Cats. The Mountaineers scored in
the fourth minute on a 25-yard
shot that dipped under the cross-
bar. The Davidson squad spent the
rest of the game in a futile attempt

to equalize.

Davidson had several good
Opportunities throughout the
game. Sophomore midfielder
Tracy Hankins had a header that
narrowly missed the goal. Sopho-
more forward Mike Friedlander
and junior midfielder Steve Ott
also had good chances. The most
dangerous action came from
freshnian midfielder Rob Vest,
who put the ball between the goal-
keeper's legs only to have a defen-
der clear it off the line.

Although the team is playing

fairly well, they just cannot win. -

Davidson has lost four matches by

-one goal. In three of those games,
they outshot their opponent, yet
failed to produce goals. To make
things worse, the team has been
held scoreless in the last :four
games.

The lack of results had the
players baffled, according. to
‘Slagle.

“We're playing better, but
we’re just not winning and that’s
frustrating,” junior goalkeeper
Josh Budde said.

Part of the problem comes
from a tough scheldule. Playing
nationally ranked teams every
week is not an easy way to get
wins. Yet that does not explain all
the losses.

Injuries are also a problem.
The Wildcats have lost junior

Andy Clarke for the season and
senior fulback Sean Moser is not
expected to return for at least two
more weeks. Junior midfielder
Steve Omli: and freshman Scott
Poisson will miss action for sev-
eral games as well.

The lack of results has the

players frustrated. “The breaks

just aren’t going our way,” Slagle
said. “They now face a test of
mental fortitiude.”~

The team travels to VMI Sun--
day, Sept. 28. They are hoping to
turn things around with a win but
realize that the Keydets will be
tough at home.

Field hockey makes adjustments for future

By PAMHARMANN |

Although’ the Davidson field
hockey team now posts an 0-5 re-
cord, any casual observer can
notice the marked improvement of
the team with each game.

There has been increased pres-
sure from the offense in the shoot-
ing circle and the defense is begin-
ning to mark better as well.

However, the team still needs
to work on midfield connections
and move better for passes. They
have also been plagued with in-
juries and illnesses since pre-sea-
son days. Coach Betsy Pryor has
yet to have a complete starting
line-up of her strongest players.

Last Friday, Davidson lost 1-0

to Salem College. Davidson
dominated the first half, yet
played up and down during the
second: half. Unfortunately they
lacked scoring ability, wheras
Salem has an excellent forward
who scored an unassisted, picture-
perfect goal.

Davidson’s defense lacked
senior Polly Northen and seemed
confused over defensive assign-
ments.

The following morning,
Davidson fell 5-0 to an excellent,
highly skilléd Eastern Kentucky
University team. Davidson played
well and moved the ball much bet-
ter than the day before, but once

IMAC news

IMAC News: ~

Sunday, Sept. 28, is the first
day of the 1986 flickerball season.
In order for this season to run
smoothly, IMAC (Intramural
Athletic Council) will sponsor a
weekly column which provides
game highlights as well as regula-
tions.

This week it is important that
all'team managers check the eligi-

Referee duties are essential. If

.. you must ref a game, go to the

equipment room (in the basement
of the gym) and pick up a ref bag.
In these kits you should check to
make sure you have the following:
two whistles, a stopwatch that
works (check to make sure), a
pencil, a set of flickerball rules,
scorecards and two footballs —

one leather and one rubber. Please
use the rubber balls in rainy wea-

~ bility of their players and the capa-
bility of their referees. All varsity
‘players must have written or ver-
bal permission from their varsity
coaches in order to participate in
-flickerball. —_
Permission from the IMAC
Office must be obtained for re-
scheduling games. Do not pri-
vately reschedule a game; it will
be deemed invalid without the
: proper permission. Only Sterling
Martin, the assistant director of
athletics, and Becky Irvin, the
athletic office secretary, can grant
permission for rescheduling

* games.

ther (yes, games will be played if
it is drizzling). Next you, the ref,

go to the flickerball fields which
are located behind the golf course
and the baseball field. Check the
roster and see who is playing on
each team. once the game is over,
report the score and return turn the kit
to the gym. We do not encourage
leaving the kit for another team’s
use. Managers are responsible for
providing competent referees.

By the way, IMAC pays each
ref $2 per game. If referees do not
show up, their team must forfeit
their tournament eligibility. If the
same team refs do not show twice,

again lacked scoring punch.

While EKU scored only one
goal the first half, during the sec-
ond half the woke up and picked
up steam while Davidson seemed
to fall apart. EKU is probably the
toughest team David- son will
have to face tiiis season.

During this game - versus
EKU, Davidson tried a new for-
mation figuring they had nothing
to lose. Instead of setting up five
forwards, three halfbacks, one up
sweep, and one back sweep, they
switched to four forwards, three
links, two halfbacks and one
sweep. Coach Pryor intends to use
this formation.from now on be-

then that team can no fonger par-
ticipate. This week, IMAC voted
to allow a freshman team to par-
ticipate in flickerball even though
they did not turn in a roster -in
time. IMAC decided that since
flickerball is an integral part of the
freshman hall experience, they
should not be denied the opportu-
nity. In the future late rosters will
not be accepted.

IMAC is sponsoring a mixed
F doubles toumament. Play will
begin by next week but only those
who are registered and who have
paid the $4 fee may play. There
will be ample time for the tourna-
ment because we will not schedule
specific game times. Instead, each
pairing. will coordinate their
games to meet the championship

date. Contact Bob Sherrill ‘or —

Mark Crowther for further detail.

Flickerball schedules will be
availible this afternoon from 4-
5:30 p.m. and all next week in the
Athletic Office (just beyond the

pool in the gym). Check the bulle- -

tin board by the Comptroller's Of-
fice for thore IMAC news.

cause it is stronger defensively
and there is more support all over
the field.

On Monday Davidson lost to
Pfeiffer 3-0. This loss was espe-
cially disapointing due to a seem-
ing lack of effort or hustle. Having
played three games in a row with
no chance to practice further ham-
pered the team’s effort.

By Wednesday at High Point
the team had shaped up and played
much better. Although they lost 1-
0, they played with a new aggres-
siveness, passed better, and dis-
played more offensive pressure
than ever. There was even an “al-
most goal.” Officially, the ball

was on, not over, the line, there-
fore no goal. However, the David-
son team, thinking they had
scored, stopped playing to cele-
brate, thus allowing the High
Point defense to move the ball out.

With about fifteen minutes to
go in the second half, freshman
Marta Bukowski was injured by
the dangerous high stick of a High
Point player. This obviously
shook up the rest of the Davidson
team. Bukowski will be unable to
play at least through Saturday
when she has her stitches re-
moved.

The team travels to Catawba

‘tomorrow for a 4 p.m. game.
