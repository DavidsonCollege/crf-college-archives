Ghosts

me to motivate myself racing
against invisible people 300 miles
away, but we did all right. It was
kind of disappointing that this was
the last dual meet for the seniors
and they don’t get to swim against
another team. But we still had a
good time, and we’ re looking for-
ward to one and a half weeks from
now (the Southern States Champi-
onships).”

The team turned in a lot of
season best times despite the lack
of competition.

On the men’s side, season
bests were recorded by Freddy
Schnell in the 100 and 200 yard
backstroke, Jason Prince in the 200
IM, Bill Paterson in the 50 and 100
freestyle, Mike Wang in the 100

and 200 breaststroke, Rick Clary ©

in the 200 breaststroke, and Dave
Maddux in the 200 freestyle.

For the women, season bests
were achieved by Catherine Ander-
son in the 50 and 100 freestyle,
Kathleen Cook in the 50 freestyle
and the 200 backstroke, Jen
Marenberg in the 100 freestyle,
and Kelly Westbrook and. Katie
Saldarini in the 200 breaststroke.

Kathleen Paffenroth com-

mented on how aware she is of her

can see the water moving, but it’s
hard to tell when someone’s be-
hind you, It’s much easier to see
someone if they’re in front, but a
lot nicer when they’re not,” she
said.

The men’s team hopes to re-
peat as Southern States Champi-
ons and to avenge 9 and 11 point
losses to rival Georgia Southern
earlier this season. The women are
shooting for at least 3rd place at
Southern states.

“We can reach our goal, but
we all have to step up and pull our
own weight,” Paffenroth said about
the women’s team. “This is a young
team and hopefully next year we’ ll
get an even better freshman class
than right now. With each better
class you get, the better your re-
cruits get because they see times
improving. Hopefully our class

’ made a difference on the recruits

looking here.”

Rosenquest sounded confident
about the men’s chances at South-
ern States as well.

““We’ ve been training so hard

,and we’ ve just started to rest. Dif-

ferent people react to tapering in

different ways. Usually about two .

weeks out I swim badly. Some
people have their times go down in
amore continuous fashion. We’re
fighting colds too,” he said, “But
we'll be ready (for Southern
States).”
