Ponders
Chapel

By MARK HODGES
Staff Writer

A joint student-faculty
committee is to be set up by
Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
to re-examine the college's
role in sponsoring education.
al programs, said Dean of
Faculty Frontis W. Johnston
this week.

This includes chapel pro.
grams, artist series. lectures
and other college sponsored
programs.

The formation of this com.
mittee is a response to the
student senate’s proposal for
modified chapel regulations.
The proposal called for:

—Fifty percent cuts.

—A comimittee with stud
ent representation to choose
speakers and programs.

_ — A reduction of chapel pro
“ams to eight a quarter.
Spencer said yesterday that

the committee would not be

“bound by tradition’ in its

investigation.

Spencer’s committee is
not only to explore the chapel
situation but to consider
what responsibility the col-
lege has to sponsor educa-
tional Activities. Johnston
said.

The problem. of compulsory
chapel attendence, said John-
ston, is a complex issue. If
Davidson were a_ larger
school. there would be no
need for compulsory attend-
ance.

At. Davidson. however.
many guest speakers would
have a very small audience
if attendance were voluntary,
the dean said. If the college
cut down substantially or
stopped altogether sponsor-
ing speakers and programs,
it would be accused of not

‘fulfilling its educational res-

PUTTING ON THE FINISHING TOUCHES
Gately eyeballs one of yearbook’s 265 pages.

Gately And Staff Finish
Casual, Unposed Q & C

By BOB WALLACE
Staff Writer

The 71st issue of Quips and
Cranks has been sent to the
publisher, and according to
editor Don Gately... only a
few of the 265 pages are be-
ing withheld for finishing
touches.

Gately said he plans an
informal approach to this
year’s annual. He has hopes
of showing the 1968-69year in
a glimpse—people and events
as they occurred. With this
in. mind Gately has elimin-
ated all posed pictures, ex-
cept those of the fraternities
and underclassmen.

“This year's book-is bigger
than. before, and we're going
to innovate numerous special
effects.”’ Gately said.

Hengeveld Rites Set

Funeral services for
Fred W. (Dutch) Henge-
veld, who was associated
with the college for over
50 years, will be held this
morning at 11 in the Da-
vidson Colfege Presbyter-
jan Church.

He died Wednesday
night at his home on Con-
cord Road. He was 71.

Hengeveld, a. native of
Palatka, Fla., held the
college record for the num-
ber of years on the fac-
ulty or staff.

He graduated from here
in 1918, then after serving

with the Marine Corps in
World War | and a brief
stint. with the Little Rock,
Ark., professional base-
ball team, returned to
teach at Davidson High
and coach the college bas-
ketbat! and baseball
teams.

He became registrar and
director of admissions in
1924 and later became full-
time registrar as enroll-
ment grew. He retired in
1967.

He is survived | by his
wife, a son and a daugh-
ter.

The annual will cost about
$15,000 to publish.

American Year Book Com-
pany. which has published
the Davidson annual for the
last three years, set four
deadlines—from mid-Decem.

Hobbie alsa focused on the

“Apathy has been a problem

that there is a way.

BACK TO 8 A.M.
Conflict Of Interest -

Ends Night Classes

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer

Several courses meeting
at night during the winter
quarter have been put back
into their original 8 a.m
class hour, the Registrar's
Office said this week.

According to Dr. Jay Ost
walt, registrar and associate
dean of the faculty, the class-
es originally scheduled at
8 am. were, informally
changed to night meetings.
“It appears that some stu-
dents had conflicting activi-

ties at night and did not .

voice their objections to the
conflicts which would result
from such changes.” he said.

The courses involved were
those of Assistant Professor
Karl Garrison of the Socio-
logy Department and In-
‘structor Robert Lennox of
the Psychology Department.

As.a result, Garrison and
Lennox have revamped their
meeting ‘times so as to meet
the’ original schedule for
which the students register-
ed.

Lennox, who teaches an
education course that was in
volved in the switch, pointed
out that his students had
circulated a petition among

change from the morning
to a night meeting time.

“It appears,"" he said,
“that some signed the peti-
tion with conflicts, reasoning
that they'd rather try to
come at night when they
could than! make it to class
in the mornings.”

Lennox said he felt night
would be better suited than
the day for the scheduling

of some classes: neverthe-
less, he pointed out the dif-
ficulty of scheduling extra-
curricular events at a school
of Davidson's size if class
programming were not struc-
tured so as to give these ac-
tivities a chance to compete.

“Personally, I am willing
to meet when students want
to meet and to be flexible—
if they choose 3 in the morn-
ing. it's all right with me.”

President Knocks
Out Of Assembly Walk-Out

Some 75 students stalked
out of chapel vasterday, but
a large scale walk-out plan-

programs failed te material-

Leaders of the walk out.
who had been predicting that
up to 76 percent of the stu-
dent body would leave, attri-
buted the small response to
the presence of President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. on
stage.

“Most people didn't leave
because Dr. Spencer was on
the stage."’ senior Scott Cut-
ting, one of the organizers,
said, ‘‘It was not because of
anything he said, though, but
out of respect for him as a
person.”'

“Nothing constructive was
said about the abolition of
compulsory chapel.”
