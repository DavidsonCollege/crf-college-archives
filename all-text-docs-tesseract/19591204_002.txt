THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1959

(All Unsigned Editorials oy the Editor)

To Avoid Misunderstanding:

Dr. Abernethy’s statement (see
elsewhere on this page) points up one
of the principal things that we were
afraid of when the DAVIDSONIAN
published its stand on the cut ques-
tion: that we might be misunderstood.
Dr. Abernethy has spent a good deal
of time on his criticism, but in the
event that he and others have misun-
derstood the editorial stand, we would
like to take this opportunity to clear
up a few of the facts. ,

The big misunderstanding seems
to be in Dr. Abernethy’s statement
of the issue at hand. We do not wish
to extend “unlimited cut privileges”
to those students who are behind on
quality points; our policy calls for
optional attendance only for those
students who have a C average or
better.

Since 124 hours and 124 quality
points are required for graduation.
those with a C average or better would
not be behind, but would be ahead on
quality points.

We wholeheartedly agree that
“where these factors have failed to
produce a mature student it is unlike-
ly that unlimited cuts will succeed.”
We have never contended that a lib-
eralized cut system alone will produce
a mature student. We merely feel
that such a system would be another
factor to add to the list encouraging
maturity. ,

Furthermore, we do not say that
“these factors have failed.” Indeed,
such factors have no doubt put a cer-
tain degree of maturity into the Da-
vidson student, and we feel that the
Davidson student, mature as he is,
is worthy of more responsibility.

“Maturity should also bring the

recognition that much important work
and even good teaching can be very
dull and exacting.” We agree com-
pletely. Our motive in supporting a
liberalized cut system is not to avoid
hard or exacting work. On the con-
trary, a presupposition of our propos-
al is the contention that the faculty
must not compromise its standards,
even if it means the loss of lazy stu-
dents.

A more liberal cut system would
not mean that the instructor must
condone laziness; the indolent stu-
dent should and would suffer for
abusing the privilege. To ensure that
lazy students would not “get by,” a
solid program of classroom supple-
ment to book material should be pre-
sented, and a thorough knowledge of
material presented in these. classes
should be required.

Dr. Abernethy takes “a rather dim
view of unlimited cuts for all students
under our present conditions.” Again
we agree. Had we wanted such a sys-
tem, we would have proposed it as
such. As it is, we ask the privilege
only for those students who meet spe-
cified academic requirements.

One final note. Dr. Abernethy sus-
pects “that most students would like
to combine the advantages of two or
three cut systems without the disad-
vantages of any of them.” We cer-
tainly would. We imagine that the
faculty and administration would, too.
This, however, is impossible. But we
think that our proposal maximizes
the advantages and minimizes the dis-
advantages.

Only a trial of the system will give
the college the answer.

Loyalty Oaths And Education

Harvard and Yale have recently
withdrawn from the federal student
loan program because of a loyalty
oath required in applying for the
loan. The oath is:

OATH

§ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that

' will bear true faith and allegiance to
the United States of America and will
support and defend the Constitution and
the flaws of the United States of Ameri-
ca against all its enemies, foreign and
domestic.

AFFIDAVIT

I do solemnly sweer (or affirm) that
I do not believe in, and am not a mem-
ber of and do not support any organiza-
tion that believes in or teaches, the
overthrow of the United States Govern-
ment by force or violence or by any
illegal or vuncortstitutional methods.

The two universities regard the
loyalty oath as a deprivation of an in-
dividual liberty. We can hardly agree

with this.

This statement is attached to an
application for a Joan. In every in-
stance a loan applicant must divulge
certain information he regards as his
personal affairs.

Certainly the State will not use
its govermental power to lay taxes
upon all the people and then use the
money collected to subsidize those
people who “believe in or teach the
overthrow” of the very government
that is supporting them. As another
aewspaper noted, “if the State is go-
ing to pay the piper, it is most cer-
iainly going to call the tune.”

The real right that has been de-
nied, to our way of thinking, is the
tight of needy students to obtain
funds in order to further their edu-

,cation because of the institutions’ re-
fusals to accept the loyalty oath along
with the funds.

Harry Golden: Self-Styled Sage

Harry Golden is one of Ameri-
ca’s great story tellers. The tale of
buying little Hymie’s suit on the east-
side is a bit of Americana worth re-
lating, as Golden does so well.

But despite the acceptance by the
Charlotte Observer of Harry Goiden
as the sage of the South we do not
accept his qualifications to speak for
us.

He didn’t come to us too highly
recommended. His past record is not
enviable. In fact, he kept it quite se-

cret, to be sure, until the facts were
bared to the public, at which time

he availed himself of the American
tradition to ‘come clean and face the
music bravely,” just as Charles Van
Doren has done recently, and just
as eloquently.

Where does he get the authority
to speak for the South? How is he
qualified to tell others exactly what
southerners want and what they
think? We douht his qualifications.

He does not limit himself to telling
what we should want or should do;
but his syndicated columns, as well
as his two best-sellers, spread across
the country telling all their readers
what the South is really thinking, aft-
er all.

To have wide-spread spokesmen is
good for the South—providing they
relay a message Southern ‘n char-
acter.

Mr. Golden should not be ac-
cepted as the South’s true spokesman
because of his ability to spin a good

things over ideology, and fact over

calculations for 1960.”

“A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE”

Professor Abernethy Opposes Liberal Cut Proposals

By G. L. ABERNETHY

Professor of Philosophy

Editor’s note: This article
was written for publication
last week. Due to tack of
space it could not be printed
until this issue, which we
now do gladly.

For a reply to this state-
ment see the editorial col-
umn.

Some students have shrewdly
observed that we have at pres-
ent a cut system which pro-
vides for the students who are
ahead on quality points most
of the advantages of an un-
limited cut system.

UNWARRANTED

The issue then, ts whether
these advantages should be ex-
tended to students who are be-
hind on quality points and
could least afford to miss class-
es. To say the least, such an
extension of privileges would
seem to be unwarranted. If

such an extension were grant-
ed, the instructor ought to have
the right to drop at any time
from a course a student who
has ceased to be a real parti-
cipant in the work of the
course.

There is a good deal of non-
sense being tossed around
about how a system of unlimit-
ed cuts for everyone would
make mature men out of im-
mature boys. Maturation is a
complex process which is con-
ditioned by personality struc-
ture, social and economic
privileges, ethical standards, vo-
cational objectives, family
training, religious | commit-
ments, intellectual curiousity
and study habits.

MATURE STUDENT

Where these factors have
failed to produce a mature stu-
dent it is unlikely that unlimited
cuts will succeed; where they
have succeeded in producing

eo °

a mature student it is unlikely
that a rigid cut system would
undo the student’s maturity.

Some superior students advo-
cate unlimited cuts for all stu-
dents because they find some
professors dull or the work re-
quired too elementary. A more
mature and constructive atti-
tide would be to bring pressure
on the Administration and Fac-
ulty to raise qualitative and
quantitative standards where
they are too low.

Maturity should also bring
the recognition that much im-
portant work and even good
teaching can be very dull and
exacting. Unfortunately some
students will not achieve this
level of maturity until they have
had some graduate school ex-
perience.

NOTICE TO READERS:

Editor’s Note: The editors of THE DAVIDSONIAN, realizing that some confusion has arisen-

cerning the use of the phrases, “unlimited cut system” and “liberal cut system,” wish to

take this opportunity to clarify their position.
G

THE DAVIDSONIAN, while using the phrases

inter-changeably,

prefers the second,

since our proposal (see Editorial Page, October 6) does not imply that we condone indis-
criminate cutting or cutting for students who do not have creditable grades.

We urge students and faculty members in their discussion of THE DAVIDSONIAN’S
position on absence regulations to be sure they proceed from an adequate understanding
of the college rules as they appear in the “Regulations For Students, 1959-60” booklet, and
of this newspaper’s proposals as they have appeared in recent issues.

It is only when all parties are well-informed that intelligent discussion may take place.
THE DAVIDSONIAN regrets that misunderstanding has arisen concerning this issue. We
do not feel, however, that misunderstanding has been due to lack of editorial clarity but to
misinformation or prejudice on the part of readers.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Irate Correspondent Comments
On Present Cut System Faults

. ‘
writs missed because of unex- many as 25% of their classes.

Dear Editor:

In the article “Faculty Dis-
plays Interest in Unlimited Cut
Policy” (Nov. 20), one profes-
sor is quoted as saying “upper-

classmen who have their re-

quired quality points can cut.
one quarter of their classes.”

' would like to call atten-
tion to the half-truth of : this
statement. From the Absence
Regulations, paragraph ([1.,
D., pertaining to the loss of
quality points by exceeding
by two the number of unex-
cused absences allowed in a
course, there is one further
clause: “In addition, the in-
structor may assess any aca-
demic penalty he deems a
propriate.” s

Apparently few professors
use (or should I say abuse) this
clause; but there are members
of the faculty who give an au-
tomati¢e F to any student who
overcuts, or lower grades to a
lesser extent.

Other forms of punishment
include giving zeroes on pop

cused absences. Although not
all professors use this clause,
a student who wishes to over-
cut can rarely be certain that
he will be safe in doing so.

Since, if any concrete steps
are taken on this matter in
the near future, they will
probably be the smallest steps
forward possible, | recommend
(1) that this clause be re-
moved from the Absence
Regulations; (2) that the 25%
rule no Jonger apply to ex-
cused absences; and (3) that
the rule denying students
who represent the college in
athletics, etc., of many of
their cut privileges be delet-
ed.

I feel that these small
changes would be a fairly ef-
fective beginning toward the
eventual establishment of a cut
system recognizing the maturi-
ty of Davidson students. They
would, in effect, at least give
students who are capable of
fair work the right to cut as

REMEMBER HOW HE USED TO
‘SWAT -THE .OL" HORSEHIDE

LAST SUMMER?

Taking for granted that
there will be no lowering of .
standards, which would be an
extremely unwise move, stu-
dents who abused their, cut
privileges—for instance, by
losing quality points below
the necessary levels for re-
admission into Davidson —
would find themselves ade-.
quately rewarded.

It is an absurdity if the pro-
ponents of required consistent
attendance in class use as their
argument the reasoning that ab-
sences will mean the student’s
grade will fall, to impose ad-
ditional “academic penalties”
for overcutting,

Rather let the student be his
own judge of the necessity of
attendance in class; I believe
the vast majority of Davidson
students are mature enough to
use increased cut privileges
wisely.

ditions, I can think of circum-
stances under which a system
of unlimited cuts for all stu:
dents might make sense.

If we were to raise the av-
erage College Board scores of
the Freshman Class by 100
points and to work hard at re-
cruiting more students who
were “hungrier academically
and economically and if we
were to raise our course re-
quirements and were to begin
to make more use of indepen-
dent study research and outside
examiners, then a system of un-
limited cuts could involve few,
if any, problems. ¢ °

“WEEK-ENDING”

It would of course involve
some serious modification of
our extra-curricular activities
and our present folkway of
“week-ending.” There is little
evidence that our students and
alumni would favor such a
rigorous program.

An alternative would be to

set up an Honors College with-
in the college where 150 stu-
dents of superior ability andjor
superior motivation would do
independent study and research
with no classroom attendance
requirements. This would be an
expensive form of education.
There is as yet no evidence
that. the Administration wants
to raise money to make such a
program possible.

I suspect that most students
would like to combine the ad-
vantages of two or three cut
systems without the disadvant-
ages of any of them. Persona)-
ly, under present circumstances
I favor retaining our present
system with the substitution of
loss of hour credit for loss of
quality credits, and the work-
ing for an increase in honors
programs and seminars for su-
perior and more highly moti-

vated students.

TOIL AND TROUBLE

How Good Is Ike '

Mr. Eisenhower left yesterday on an international

intricacies of foreign affairs as the professional diplo-

The significance of the trip, lies not in attempts to
solve problems, however, but in a demonstration of per-
sonal concern by the President for the problems which
face the alliance. This is, if nothing else, of enormous
propaganda value to the U.S.

The peoples of the Western nations will have more
appreciation of the program of defense, trade, and so.
on that the U.S. endorses. That this appreciation will

be largely emotional is of

little consequence, for pub-

lie opinion is rarely based on realistic appraisal of

affairs.

The need for solidarity of public opinion is great.

People, long conditioned to the tensions of the
cold war, are bewildered by the present front of friend-

This is a mission the President can accomplish. His

prestige, venerability, and

personality make him most

fitted for the task. If the government is prepared to
make the most of this, Mr. Eisenhower's trip could easily
be a brilliant success. But if personal diplomacy is to be
the goal, this would be better left up to the professionals.

Excerpts From Speech

People cannot be handled things to illustrate that some

like guinea pigs in a laboratory.
Until some more scientific
means can be devised, we must
depend on experience and ob-
servation in reaching opinions
about the behavior of races and
what happens when different
races meet.

Holmes Alexander, the
newspaper columnist, recent-
ly quoted Edmund Burke as
calling prejudice “the wis-
dom of unlettered men.”
Alexander added the com-
ment that without prejudice,
the human race might never
have emerged from the
primeval slime.

If it is right to limit the con-
cerns cf this college to Chris-
tian education of males, why
should anyone suggest some-
thing wrong with segregation by
race? This analogy may not be
free of holes and I shall not
belabor it. I only mention these

kinds of segregation are’ will-
ingly accepted.

Why do Negroes object to
association with their own
race? It is a question t often
ask and never hear answered
satisfactorily.

I am not defending siavery.
It should never have happened.
Everyone is thankful the slaves
have been freed. But freedom
from slavery does not mean
freedom to impose unwanted
associations, or interfere with
the rights of others.

eos

Mixing of races can lead
to nothing, but discord and
tragedy. The turmoil in the
blackboard jungles to which

I have referred is one aspect.

Learning is impossible in

such an atmosphere. In the

South, Negro teachers main:

tain discipline .among their

own color without fear of
being charged with racial
discrimination.

This is not the report of a
biased Southern editor. It is
the factual picture being drawn
nowadays even behind the Pa-
per Curtain that has covered
for many years the racial con-
flicts of the North. Today the
mess is bubbling over. Too
many people are experiencing
terror for further concealment.
