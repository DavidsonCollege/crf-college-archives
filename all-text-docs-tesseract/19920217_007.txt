Thanks

The editorial board of theDavidsonian would like to take the
opportunity to thank the past editors, David Thompson and David
Smyth, for their untiring work on the paper over the past year. The
work of Thompson and Smyth carried the newspaper to the next

level following the restructuring of the paper two years ago. The _

efforts of the newspaper editorship largely go unnoticed by a
majority of the student body and Thompson and Smyth deserve
campus acknowledgement of their service to the school this year.
Through their leadership and diligence theDavidsonian has be-
come one hell of acollege newspaper. We hope that we can carry
on that tradition.

Campus Tensions

In atime when our campus has been consumed by strife and
tension, an important point was made at this weekend’s Honor
Council trial. One of the students involved believed that a lot of
the anxieties on campus could have been avoided if students had

merely talked things out one on one and handled each incident in-

dividually.. This is an important point. Much of the difficulties
we presently experience are the result of misconceptions among
members of this community. Handling things individually would
have avoided a great deal of the problems addressed in the
community.

How can this be accomplished? Working and at tetas out
concems between each other is one way. The Davidsonian
hopes to serve as a vehicle for easing the specific incidents of
discord on campus. We hope that more members of the commu-
nity will use us as a sounding board fer their ideas and concerns.
Open discussions of our communal problems will be the most
effective means of solving them, instead of allowing individual
occurrences to explode into general feelings of disharmony by
way of our small campus rumor mill. We therefore believe that
each problem should be dealt with individually and not be
grouped together as a universal campus attitude. By treating
problems in this way, it is highly possible that these pervasive
negative feelings will begin to disappear.

Edmondson Discusses Minus Grades

4 Pa & s 4 > 4
Rif ORES BEI we SLE

Editor's Note:The following
letter is arevision ofaprevi-
ous “Letter to the Editor”
written by Earl Edmonson
who penned the original
before reading last week's
articles regarding the minus
grades. The following takes
into consideration what was
written and responds and
amends.

To the Editor,

Through the grapevine I
understand that some stu-
dents are bothered by the
grading scale that I supplied
in response to a question-
naire from the SGA’s sub-
committee on minus grade,
a scale that has “90-92” as
As BT 89” as “B+”, and
so on. The perturbed stu-

dents seem to think that
people like me should allow
a lower score (87? 887) to
earnan“A-”, I would like to
comment at some length in
hopes of contributing to a

clearer understanding of the

grading process and of the
new grading system.

In my approach to grad-
ing, numbers are calculating
tools, not determinants. That
is; I (and probably many
other faculty members not
in natural sciences and math,
for example) first decide on
a letter evaluation (A? A-?

B+?) and then assign a

number grade to a paper or
test essay to seflect that
qualitative reading (e.g.,““A-
"=91;"“B+"=88). Accord-
ingly, itmakesno difference

whether the lowest number
for an “A-” is 90 or 87. A
semester average of 89 pro-
duces a submitted grade of
“B+” only because the pre-
ponderance of qualitative
evaluations throughout the
semester yield that result.
My experience this past
fall suggests that two of the
expectations associated with
the new system apply: some
students received “A-” (or
“B-”) instead of “B+” (or
“C+”) , and some receive
“B+” (or “C+’”) instead of
“A-” (or “B-”) . But the
actual GPA of my grades for
alargeclass this time around
is amazingly close to that of
my grades that I submitted

Stackhouse Recounts Experience

I chase not towrite about
my specific experiences in
Nepal and India on the Ti-
betan Studies Program due
to some advice I received
fromaTibetan student when
I was writing a research
paper. He told me, "You
should write to help other
people. If that is your goal,
it will be good.” I hope this
essay will motivate you to
help others , whether they
are Tibetans or some other
mistreated or unfortunate
group of people.

I felt.a tinge of guilt as I
saw the tear well up in
Sonam’s eye. I-felt person-
ally responsible for his pres-
entsadness, although the true
cause of it had nothing to do
with me. Sonam, a twenty-
two year old monk from
Tibet, had been introduced
to me about two.weeks ear-

lier. Despite the short time,
Sonam and I had become
very Close friends as we spent
time studying in the library
of the Central Institute of
Higher Tibetan Studies in
Sarnath, India. The day af-
ter I met Sonam he told me
how badly -he wanted to re-
turn to Tibet to see his par-
ents, with whom he had not
had any contact since he was
ten years old. (Try, if you
can, to imagine not even
hearing from your parents
for the last twelve years.) I

asked him how he escaped >

from Chinese occupied Ti-
bet. He told me that his
parents brought him out to
India and then returned to
Tibet without him, leaving
him atthe Tibetan Children’s
Village. The TCV is a very
efficient and successful
school system which was

started by His Holiness the
Dalai Lama when he was
forced into exile by the
Communist Chinese forces

explain that shortly after his
parents returned to Tibet, his

much closer than that first
day after we met. As we sat

that he had just written an
