Minter Discusses Pre-Law Program

(Continued from page 1)

Minter addressed himself to
the lack of interviews for pre-
law students.

“This has become an issue
because the pre-med com-
mittee offers interviews for its
students.

‘*‘Most law schools
discourage interviews. That's
why we don’t have a large
scale interview system.

“The pre-law program is
decentralized because ther

are no certain widespread
qualifications for law school

applicants.”’
The pre-law committee does

not take a ‘‘neon sign’’ type at-
titude in its recruitment of
pre-law students.

“We give information to any
student who comes by con-
cerning their chances for ad-
mittance, profiles of law
schools, and information on
past Davidson graduates,”’
said Minter.

“We do not want to deceive

any student about his chances
of gaining admittance into law
school. Admittance is harder
to gain every year.

“The legal job market is
also tight and growing tighter.
This year an estimated 29,000
individuals will pass the bar
exam. Yet the Bureau of
Labor Statistics forecasts that
only 16,500 will find jobs.

Even if one is fortunate
enough to obtain a job, sub-
stantial salaries are not easy
to come by.. The starting

lawyer's salary in California
ranges from $8500 to $16,000 a

year.

“Only after 20 or 30 years
can the average lawyer expect
to earn $20,000 or $30,000 a
year,” said Francis Utley of
the American Bar
Association.

“In lieu of this situation, we
advise many of the students
who come to us to consider
business schools and public
hospital administration
programs,” Minter said.

‘‘We cannot, of course, veto
the plans of students who wish
to seek the pursuit of law, but
we can use our influence upon
the perhaps unqualified
student as well as those who
may not have the needed
motivation.

“This influence should be in
the direction of careful con-
sideration of alternatives.
That this plan has had some
effect is evident from an
analysis of our admittance
statistics,"’ said Minter.

Last week, THE DAVIDSONIAN prin-
ted an article on the nature of career
counseling and job placement at David-
son. This week, nine seniors were in-
terviewed for their opinions concerning
the present state of professional guidance
offered by the college. The comments
ranged from the strongly enthusiastic for
the pre-medical and pre-ministerial
programs to the dissatisfied for the op-
portunities available through the
placement office.

William Ralston, a history major, has
decided to go into the army and con-
sequently, took advantage of the career
counseling of the R.O.T.C. department.
He commented, ‘‘I just feel that I should
take a couple of years off from school to
broaden myself, to get some experience
with people and to support myself finan-
cially. The army has given me this option
and could probably help me when I
decide to return to school. Their advice
has been excellent.”’

English major Chris Holly struck a
more negative chord saying, ‘‘I didn’t
even know that we had job counseling.
We should have a person that would deal
with this business full-time. Suzie Sum-
mers has said that she has no time to
solicit interviews and that’s serious - we
can’t just expect companies to come to
us.
‘I’m going to work next year and then
go to Europe. When I return to the United
States, I’ll probably go on to graduate
school, but I have never asked professors
about good graduate schools. I haven't
meee any effort to get information on

Another English major, Alan Blakey,
remarked, ‘I’ve had no career coun-
seling here. Next year I’m going back to
France and I hope to teach in a Berlitz
school. My feelings about the situation at
Davidson are that I’ve been channelled
through the academic system for 16
years. It’s best prepared me to live in an
academic community.

“I'd like to have the teaching ex-
perience for about a year. I thing there's
a lot to be said for the incidental system

of education. I think, though, that —

vocational exposure would be good, but
we haven’t had many good opportunities
here for that.”

Junior Rollie White is majoring in

foreign service or in systems analysis.

“T’ve had career counseling with Kincaid
towards systems analysis and counseling

toward foreign service work with Liston
and Proctor.

Career Counseling Criticized

‘‘My primary choice is the foreign ser-
vice and I hope this will work out. The
counseling has been good when I can find
these people. It seems to me that they
should take the initiative in contacting
us.”’

Another senior, who wished to remain
anonymous, commented, ‘I have
had no career counseling at all. I’m going
to teach school at Darlington in Rome,
Ga. My four years here have made
me a college man and I have no regrets at
all. However, no one has helped me at all.
Davidson has helped me only in that the
president of Darlington is a Davidson
man.”’

Bob Stouffer, a pre-law student and
history major chose to register a mild
complaint concerning the quality of
career counseling. ‘‘I haven’t had any
career counseling, I’d say that the pre-
law program here is mediocre. I think the
professors could do a much better job of
finding out what schools want Davidson

people.

“I first became interested in law
through Dr. Lester. I knew that he has
some knowledge of it. But many of the
professors here don’t know enough about
law schools admissions to offer
reasonable counseling.”

English Major Mary Hobbie said, ‘‘I’ve
had some career counseling - I was at the
placement meeting and found out that I
didn’t want any of the jobs they were of-
fering. I was offered positions in sales of
one sort or another, but I wasn’t in-
terested in that. I’ve also tried Dr.
Hight’s program and that didn’t help
very much. Next year I’m not going to do
anything. I’m going to save some money
and go to Europe and then maybe go on
to law school.

‘I'll probably be a waitress. Davidson's
doing what I wanted it to do. I made a
choice for the liberal arts and I think the
background is good. I feel that I have
been enriched from the education. But

I’ve decided for myself that I’ve eventu-
ally got to go to law school.’’

Hutch Brown, a German major, said
‘‘I haven't had any career counseling. I
haven't been looking for a regular job.
Suzie Summers has a couple of catalogs.
She cannot recommend me to anybody

for a good paying summer job. I suppose

| it’s because she doesn’t have the resour-
| ces. The students that need these sum-

mer jobs need them to pay for their

political science and hopes to work inthe | ““wrhe colieseg

_“The college ought to help students find

high paying jobs so that they could
for tuition here,” he said. id

‘“Next year I’m going back to Marburg.
I’ve talked to Dr. Gaige, and he has given

me addresses there, but no suggestions
for living arrangements. I know that
there are places in Marburg reserved for
Davidson students, and that the number
of students going there for JYA has
decreased,’’ Brown said.

“There seems to be a certain amount of
unwillingness to help. We have paid a cer-
tain amount of money, and after this no
further help by the institution is given.
But Gaige did say that he would write to
the Davidson director in Marburg,”’
Brown indicated.

He also said that he doesn’t think
there’s any preparation made for the
student to find out what will be expected
from him in the business world.

“The student gets no practical
teaching. There is no analysis of
capitalist society - this is important - you
don't know why you've been shaped to
think certain ways. There is no emphasis
on understanding social forces such as
the employer-employee relationship.’
Brown added.

John Douglas, who is going to medical
school, said, ‘‘They’ve made a lot of im-
provements in the pre-medical program
since I was a freshman. One needs help in
planning crowded science courses. Since
I was a freshman Dr. Frederickson has
put a lot of order into the program. The in
terview system is good, and it has
helped.”

He noted that although all med schools
ask for premed reccomendations, a lot
of people don’t know professors well’
enough to ask for them. Pre-meds should
especially get to know Dr. Kimmel and
Dr. Fredericksen .

Calling pre-med a major of chance,
Douglas said, ‘Students should look at
themselves soon enough to decide
whether of not they can get into med
school.”

A pre-ministerial student, Brad Long
commented, ‘‘I’ve been lucky; I’m a
psychology major, and I’’ve been able to
see what the fields of social science and
religion encompass. The pre-ministerial
counseling has been exceilent. They’ve
made arrangements to bring church
leaders and ministers here.”

Dr. Maloney and others have been very
helpful and supportive in aiding me to
develop my own commitments. Also they
serve aS a very important sort of
psychological support. It is encouraging
to be able to go in and talk to men who
have made the same sort of com-
mitments.”’

It is apparent that many seniors at
Davidson are unsure of their future.
Many of them agree that a full time

specialist is needed to assist them in their
search.
