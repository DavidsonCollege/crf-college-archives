Bob. Doty—Senior

This seems to me to be
an arrangenient as could be made
and certainly more satisfactory
than those of previous years. Per-
sonally, I appreciate, and I be-
lieve that the majority of - the
students do, the fact that the offi-
cers of the Athletic Association re-
cognize the tradition of “girl’s tick-

as good

ets” and were willing to undertake
the expense of keeping up tradition.
The settlement of this question

ought to be perfectly agreeable to
all students, I believe.

Bill Hamilton—Junior

I think. that the
plan for reduced price football tick-
ets fine. The two hundred
available tickets will be plenty
every case. Having a set
rule as to the price, quantity, and
use, will do away with the constant
bickering and ill feeling of the past.

newly adopted
is
in
almos:

As I see it, there is only one
disagreeable factor in this new
plan; that is, that only a girl friend

may be admitted on this ticket.
There was this fault with former
“girl's tickets.” It seems me
that each student should -have the
privilege of, using his “guest ticket”
as he.pleases for father, mother,

to

brother, or friend. What would
be the harm in this? One person
occupies as much space as an-

other and it would be easier on the
student’s* pocketbook if he could
take any guest on this ticket rather
than having it to pay full price for
a reserved seat.
John E. W. Clark—Sophomore

I think that the new system of,
guest football tickets will be a
great asset to both the college and
the students. Heretofore students
have abused the purchase of such
tickets and now with the present
system, tickets are limited to the
students as it should be. The

all present difficulty is due to con-
fusion with the old.

ticket sales will undoubtedly rise
and this will help both the team
and the Athletic Association. Per-

haps now, with such a plan on what
seems to me a economical
basis, more students ‘will strive for
the first two hundred guest tickets.
However, after the first two hun-
dred are sold, a student may ob-
tain a ticket at full price and also
the adjoining seat free, Since this
plan more than to both
parties concerned, the system now
in effect should, and, I think, will
work. A great deal of conflict will

be avoided and time saved.

years,

The athletic department has also
provided Sports equipment to be
checked out by the students. This
idea reigns, also as an innovation
on the hill, Footballs, basketballs,

and other such sports equipage may
be secured by any student for use

in the ‘afternoons.
