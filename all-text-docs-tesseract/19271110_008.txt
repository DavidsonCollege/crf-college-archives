State Davidson’s Boast

Manager Link Begins Pre-Season
Work on Diamond

For the past two months the work of
improving the baseball diamond has been
going on. Under the supervision of Bob
Link, manager of baseball, the Junior and
Sophomore managers have been carrying
on the task. The work of sifting sand,
elevating and leveling the ground is about
two-thirds completed, and will be finished
sometimes before the Christmas holidays.
This will give the field ample time to
settle before the’season starts. Davidson
has an excellent diamond, it being the
only one in the state with a grass infield;
and present improvements will put the
field in the best possible condition.

Girls’ Club ‘Héliors

Miss Sarah Lingle was entertained sev-
eral days ago by the Girls’ Club at their
first. meeting of the fall. There were 12

young ladies present. After all had as-
sembled, the guests were invited into the
dining room to be served with a delight-
ful luncheon. The table was decorated
with pink roses and pink candles. Each
favor had written upon it the names of
Miss Sarah Lingle and Mr. Robert Garth.
The hostess chose this method to an-
nounce the engagement of Miss Lingle
to Mr. Garth. At Miss Lingle’s place lay

a beautiful shoulder corsage, which had

been provided by her fiance. Among the
many dishes served were delicious heart
shaped cakes, very appropriate for the
occasion,

Mr. Garth has been a member ofthe
faculty of Columbia University for four
years. He now holds a position on the
faculty of Hunter College, which is loca-
ted in New York City. He is carrying on
research work there. Miss Lingle is the
daughter of Dr. T. W. Lingle, professor
of French at Davidson. Miss Lingle is
herself a distinguished linquist. She has
studied many languages abroad, special-
izing in French. She has held a position
on the faculty of Converse College as in-
structor of French,

As yet no definite date has been set for
the marriage, but it is expected to take
place sometime during the ensuing win-
ter.

Whosoever attracts into the bonds of
marriage any male subject of His Ma-
jesty by means of rouge or powder, per-
fumes, false teeth, false hair, steel cor-
sets, hooped petticoats, high heels or
false hips will be prosecuted for sorcery
and the marriage will be declared null
and void, if the accused is convicted !—

“Y” Column

The annual Fall Life-Campaign of the
Y will start this Sunday under the direc-
tion of Dr. Vander Meulen, President of
Louisville Theological Seminary. These
services will start at Vespers Sunday and
will continue through, Wednesday. The
speaker is a man who is very well known
through the ‘South and one who will
bring stirring and inspirational messages
to Davidson men. He is a fine speaker
and preacher and a deep thinker, but at
the same time he is always ready to ad-
vise and help young men with their prob-
lems and difficulties. He understands the
troubles that are apt to arise in the life
of a college man, and he is‘ably fitted
to counsel anyone, and aid them greatly
in solving some particular thing that
might be bothering them.

If you would care to talk to Dr. Van-
der Meulen and have an interview with
him, just tell Bill Hill or Camp O’Neal,
and it will—-be=arranged at a time that
will be agreeable to both. Dr. Vander
Meulen has expressly stated that he is
anxious to learn to know as many David-
son men as he can, and he feels that
these interviews will be the best way of
learning to intimately know a number of
students here. So don’t fail to have an
appointment made if you care to talk to
him.

The Y feels very fortunate in having
Dr. Vander Meulen as the leader of this
series of services, and hopes that the
student body will remember the Y and its
work in their prayers, and lend it hearty
support, especially by: making the- at-
tendance at these meetings large. A
great work can be done on the Davidson
campus, but it will take the efforts and
endeavor of the entire school to make
the Master’s work a success. So let’s
pitch in and give Dr. Vander Meulen
good audiences.

Ri a, ee
A deputation will be sent to Concord
this week to assist the Concord Y in the
observance of Prayer Week. This week
of prayer keeps the great power of pray-
er before the people of the community.
Veo
The Y has no way to judge the interest
that the student body has in the work of
the Y. M. C. A,, unless it is by the at-

tendance at the Sunday Vesper services,
and the officers -feel that the speakers

ought to be given hearing by more than |

have been attending the services of late.
The number that heard Dr. Gammon, an
excellent speaker and a great preacher,
fell below any. so far this year, and rep-
resented only a small part of the student
body The Y feels that the men that

come here to speak at Y are some of the.
best speakers and leaders in the South, |

all of whom have something worth hear- |
ing. So let’s try to come out to Y and}
you'll feel that your time has been well |
spent.

It’s easy to remember

ball on the 10-yard line of the Wolfpack and |
consequently in a position to score.

As the game opened Davidson kicked to
State, who took the ball and on line plays
failed to gain and punted to Davidson. Aft-|
er another exchange of punts, the ball was
in the hands of the Presbyterians on their
own 40-yard marker, and after failing to
gain they lost a slight advantage as Grey
fluked a punt out of bounds for no gain.
State took the ball and hard driving against
the Davidson line availed them nothing and
punts were exchanged and the ball was in
State’s possession with 80 yards between
them and the Davidson goal.

was lessened by 25 yards as Warren went off |

tackle on the first play. Hunsucker and
Warren made two more first downs, and a|
pass to Goodwin put the ball 10 yards from
the goal. After two plays had failed to gain,
another pass from McDowall to Goodwin,
who waited over the goal line, was good for
the first six points. Adams’ kick for extra
point failed.

Then came a break that put a fire of hope
in the hearts of the Davidson supporters as
State fumbled on their 35-yard line and Da-
vidson recovered. But the hopes were short

lived as three plays availed the ’Cats nothing
and they were forced to kick.

The most spectacular gain of the day came

early in the second quarter. After State had
made’a first ‘down, McDowall -took: the ball
on an end run and got by the entire Davidson
defence. But Harrison and Grey, fast Da-
vidson backs, immediately started in pursuit,
the former diving for the fleeting McDowall
and slowing him down and Grey downed him
only eight yards from the goal line. He had
| gained 65 yards. Another pass from Mc-
| Dowall to Goodwin went over for the second
| touchdown.
In the third quarter Davidson opened up
| with line plays that were sensational. After
| punts had been exchanged Harrison went off
tackle for 25 yards, to be followed by a run
t the ball 10 yards from the
| goal. A line play. failed to gain and a pen-
| alty was inflicted on State. The driving Nis-
bet took the ball on the next play and took it
| over. The kick for extra point failed and
‘the Davidson scoring for the day was over.

In the last quarter State continued their
| passing which netted them two more touch-
|downs. McDowall took the ball and raced
| across the field with tacklers all around him,
| jumped high in the air and seemer to be able
|to hit a dime time after time. A long pass to
| Goodwin was good for the final touchdown
and another pass over the goal line garnered
| the extra point.
| The rumored weak line of State proved to
| be rather strong in this game, and the entire
| team. gave their leaders great assistance.
McDowall, Warren and Goodwin were a
phenominal trio. Harrison and Grey were
|the shining lights of the Davidson team.
| Melton, Jim Grey and McColgan played good
| games in the line.
