DO PROFESSORS GET JUSTICE?

How did you feel when: you got your
last mid term if it had a good many
“Excellents” and every professor had
marked you “Punctual," of “Clean
Habits,” and those other complimentary
things? How did you feel when during
a little conference with a professor he
told you that you were doing good work
in his department and that you were
making marked improvement? You
were clated and were glad that he told
you that. You were encouraged and
felt that you would do better work.

How many professors did you ever go
to at the end of a term’s work and tell
them that you enjoyed their course and
that you had gotten inestimable good
from them? We feel that most of us
are not guilty. It is a piece of gross
carelessness on our part. “Phe professor
is not a mechanism which rotates from
class to class in the same stolid manner.
He is human just as we. Just as you
felt encouraged so will he feel that his
course is appreciated (if you tell him so)
and hence he will find great satisfaction
in this, for in this course or courses his
soul is entwined. This expression of ap-
preciation is due him if you really like
his course. It is nothing but justice.

This policy of making the professor
feel that his work is appreciated has not
generally bean in vogue here. An analysis
shows this is due largely to two reasons:
first, neglectfulness; and secondly, the
idea is conceived that the professor will
think that the student is trying to get a
“pull.” or that he is trying to “sew up a
pass.” This second reason is probably
wholly an unsound one. If you were to
be conditioned, you are going to be con-
ditioned (something of  predestina-
tion) whatever vou may say to the
professor, From first-hand authority we
sav that it is sustaining to a teacher to
hear favorable comments on his courses.
Then the only obstacle to overcome is the
first one—that of neglect and thought-
lessness—the bane of a person’s progress
and complete rounding out of a higher
development.

This Spring, after examinations are

IMPROVEMENTS MADE
ON ‘THE CAMPUS

During the last two wecks a squad of
men has been busy on the campus, rak-
ing up leaves, moving trees, and improv-
ing the campus in general. “The grounds
will be in splendid condition by the time
Junior Speaking comes around. Since
the use of various paths across the
campus has been discontinued a notice-
able difference in the appearance of the
grounds has been noticed.

For a short time it seemed that the
lawn in’ front of Rumple and Watts
was to be hopelessly marred, due to the
onslaught of many ambitious young ball
players. However, it was decided to
give the students the use of the plot near
the water tanks and in front of Georgia
building for the purpose of athletic pur-
suits. Accordingly the young trees on
this tract were moved to the space in
front of Rumple and Watts, and appear
to be thriving. ‘The lawn in front. of
the dormitories is a prominent spot and
it is well that it should remain beautiful.

By the rotation of events and the irre-
sistible logic of righteousness which sum-
mons every brave arm to the right side
of the cause, the United States has en-
tered this war. And it will never turn
back until it has given the world peace:
not merely a cessation of conflict, but a

neace based on righteousness.—Newton

The Polity Club was fortunate in
having Dr. Ussher for an address last
Thursday evening. Because of his inti-
mate knowledge of the subject, Dr.
Ussher was able to give many new ideas
concerning the political relations in the
near East. “he meeting was an open
meeting, and many were in attendance
in addition to the members of the club.

The first part of Dr. Ussher's address
was a discussion of the foreknowledge
that the Vurks had of the approach of
the Kuropean war. In 1898, the time of
Emperor Wilhelm’s visit to Constanti-
nople, the “Turkish army became a part
of the German military machine and
joined with the Germans in planning for
an empire from the North Sea to the
Indian Ocean.

In 1981 the ‘Vurkish government de-
cided to massacre all Christians—native
and American. “The United States gov-
ernment requested Russia to undertake
the protection of our interests in Turkey.
and the Russian government immediately
planned for any eventualities.

Dr. Ussher then talked of the attitude
of the Germans to the Armenian massa-
cres. He. said that the outrages com-
mitted by the “Turks were known and
ordered by the Imperial government.

The Armenians were a progressive.
industrious people and altho they have
not had self-government for six hundred
years, they were devoted to their country
and will not give up their language.
The German government ordered the in-
tellectual leaders among the Armenians
to be killed and the remainder deported
along the Berlin- Bagdad railway.

Dr. Ussher said that he believes that
the ‘Purks hate the Germans worse than
any other nation on earth. Constanti-
nople is a German citv. [te is under
German police, but the citizens feel that
if the police were removed that the Ger-
man residents would be killed.

In answer to 2a question as to the ad-
visability of the United States declaring
war on Turkey, he said that we could
gain nothing by such.a course. He said
that a declaration of war on Turkey at
present would simply mean the utter de-
struction, by the Germans, of all Amer-
ican property in Turkey.

Dr. Ussher was able to throw a new
light on the character and possibilities of
the Russians. They are a good, kind-
hearted people who hate no one—not
ven the Germans. He declared that
‘he only hope for Russia was for Ger-
‘nany to demand so much and advance so
far into Russia that the whole nation

will become thoroly aroused and strike
back.
