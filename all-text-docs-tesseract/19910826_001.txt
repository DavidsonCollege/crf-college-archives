regatta, held Saturday.

Third West Claims
Victory in 91 Regatta

By Tom Price
The 1991 Freshman Regatta was
held this past Saturday at. the
Davidson Lake Campus. The
regatta, which has become a tradi-
tional part of the Freshman orien-
tation, challenges Freshman halls

to build a sea-worthy vessel on a

budget of $10.

After assembling a suitable raft,
four members of each hall climb
aboard and do their best to race
their craft. Although there was a
great variety in boat designs, the
mostcommon materials used were
empty beer kegs, inner tubes, ply-

wood, and that quick-fix miracle,
duct tape.

_ Themenof Third West claimed
the title this year on board their
sleek, stylish blue tarp. Duct tape,
of course, was used to seal the ends
of this canoe-like vessel.

- After everyone dragged their
crafts from the now-muddy water,
the competition moved to the dry
land of the peninsula. “Tug-of-

and “egg toss” were the next
activities. Despite the rope burns
and egg-splattered shirts, every-
one seemed to enjoy the festivi-
ties.

through the building.”

In talking about the design,
Knox said thatalot of factors were
taken into consideration including
the college, the walking downtown
mall, and the future arts building.
Knox commented that he and oth-
ers believed that the building tied
in well with the architecture of the
college. Dennis Hall of Helper and
Hall was the chief architect of the
new building.

The new Town Hall gives
Davidson a better control of its fire
department. In the past, fire ve-
hicles had to be parked at various

places around town. In the new ~

building all fire department ve-
hicles can be parked at the same
location.

Knox summed up his feeling
about the new building, “I think
that it meets our current needs and
anticipates the future.”

Explosive Chemical
Removed From Lab

By David Thompson
From approximately 9:30 AM
until 12:00 noon on Saturday,
August 24, members of the
Davidson police department re-
stricted access to a section of
Concord Road and instructed local
residents to evacuate their homes
while employees of the Advanced
Environmental Transfer Corpora-
tion (AETC) removed a volatile
chemical from the Martin Chemi-
cal Laboratory.
=. Public Safety...director. Ray

’ Thrower, in accordance with stan-

dard procedures, cleareda 500 foot
radius while AETC employees
neutralized the chemical by add-
ing distilled water and removed it
from the building. The E. H. Little
Library, Chambers Building, the
College Union, and the Charles A.
Dana Science Building were also
evacuated. — :

Ray Liguori, a safety inspector
hired by the college, discovered
nearly two kilograms of crystal-
lized picric acid during a quarterly
inspection Friday afternoon. Pic-
ric acid is used as an “intermedi-
ate” in the creation of chemical
compounds, according to Davidson
College spokesman Bill Giduz.
Although perfectly safe in a liquid
State, picric acid becomes highly
explosive once it crystallizes.
Mitch Barber, a representative of

AETC, said of the chemical’s
explosive potential that “about a
pound would tear apart a Cadil-
lac.” He said that picric acid is
known as a Category |

explosive. Outof three categories,
Category I is the least dangerous.

Inorder to neutralize the chemi-
cal, AETC technicians had to
remove caps from all seven bottles
with a special machine. This task
was among the most dangerous
steps in the procedure because the
acid can be exploded with even
minorfriction. ==

Safely removed from the
Martin Laboratory, the seven 250
gram bottles of acid will be taken
to Creedmore, NC, where the
AETC company is headquartered.
Once they attain a permit to trans-
port the chemical, they will take it
to the Thermalkem Corporation
for incineration.

The chemical had apparently
been sitting on a shelf for about
twenty years without having been
noticed before Friday. A similar
incident recently at Central Pied-
mont Community College in Char-
lotte alerted safety inspectors to
the danger of the chemical’s pres-
ence. Until recently, schools and
colleges have generally purchased
their chemicals in bulk amounts,
and surpluses can sit unused for a
