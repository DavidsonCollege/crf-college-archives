Middle East

Political discussion between leaders of
Middle Eastern countries and Israeli candi-
dates has intensified with the approach of
parliamentary elections in Israel on No-
vember 1.

This. past weekend Jordan’ s King
Hussein met with PLO Chief Yasir Arafat
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and agreed to form a new confederation
that will work for peace in the region. Few
details of the proposal were given.

The agreement drew sharp criticism
from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir,
the candidate for the conservative Likud
bloc. Shamir claimed that Hussein’s en-
dorsement of Israeli Foreign Minister Shi-
mon Peres was outrageous and he called for
the people of Israel to reject it.

On: Sunday while the two candidates
debated in Israel, King Hussein appeared
on ABC’s “Nightline,” and said that Sha-
mir’s re-election would be “an absolute

disaster.” Sources in Cairo say that Arab
leaders are apparently seeking to prevent
Shamir’s re-election in support of Peres’
plans for Mideast peace.

London,

Last Thursday legislation was intro-
duced in the British House of Commons
that would abolish the right of suspects in
Northern Ireland to remain silent during
police questioning. The legislation is the
latest effort by the British Government to
control the Irish Republican Army.

Seen by the public as a clear threat to
civil liberties in Great Britain, the new law
may take effect early next year in Ireland
and eventually in England and Wales.
Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King
stated that the silence techniques used by
terrorists with the police are now used by
suspects of other serious selon such. as
racketeering.

The new law will allow a judge to regard
silence as an indication of guilt. The legis-

lation is expected to pass since its conser-
vative supporters have a 101-seat majority
in Parliament.

West Germany

Continuing efforts to improve relations
with the Soviet Union, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on Monday began a4 day trip
to Moscow. With the elimination of the
intermediate-range nuclear weapons be-
ginning in central Europe, Kohl has repeat-
edly stressed the importance of an im-
proved East-West political climate.

Economic issues will undoubtedly be
another key topic area as West Germany
seeks to capitalize on the growing business
opportunities under Mikhail Gorbachev’s
new openness towards the West. Some
Americans fear Gorbachev may ‘be trying
to drive a wedge between West Germany
and the other NATO nations.

Kohl stresses that his efforts are in line
with the overall trend of improved Western
ties with the Soviets.

Beyond Davidson: National Issues

International Issues

Arms-for-Hostages

The State Department confirmed
Wednesday that it cooperated with the
Chilean and Israeli governments to block a
deal last spring when Iran sought to ex-
change U.S. built F5 jet fighters for the
freedom of 4 American hostages.

The Chilean government was trying to
unload the jet fighters as it could no longer
obtain spare parts from the U.S. due. to
sanctions brought on by its abhorrent rec-
ord of human rights violations.

In the final stages of the deal, which
began last December, Iran’s parliamentary
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani authorized
Raymond Molina, a Cuban-American cur-
rently living in Florida, to inform the U.S.
that the hostages would be freed if the U.S.
allowed Iran to acquire Chile’s F5’s.

The $170 million deal was rejected by
the U.S. under a policy known as “
tion Staunch”. which is meant to block
shipment of weapons to Iran.

Congress

The 100th Congress adjourned
on Saturday at 3:16 in the morn-
ing, but not before pushing
through some last minute legisla-
tion. One of the biggest of these
was a $2.8 billion bill to combat
drugs. A voice vote approval was
given to the drug measure which
authorizes more money for drug
education and treatment, as well
as stiffer euneaone for users and
traffickers. :

-. Preservationists -were ‘able to

push through a bill that will save a
Civil War battleground from the
bulldozers of commercial devel-
opers. The 522 acre tract of land
outside of Washington D.C. is the
site of General Robert E. Lee’s
headquarters during the Second
Battle of Manassas in 1862 and
will’ become part of Manassas
National Battlefield Park. The
decision marks a big victory for
preservationists over the Hazel/
Peterson Companies who had

planned to build a shopping mall ©

on the site.
In the wake of last year’s crash

and growing concern over the
ethics of the brokers on Wall
Street, Congress passed legisla-
tion aimed at cutting down on the
inside trading. Provisions were
passed that would greatly in-
crease the monetary penalties and
jail terms of those convicted of
insider trading. Despite all of
their difficulties, the 100th U.S.
Congress was able to pass a num-
ber of bills thatrepresented a wide
range of interests. From bills on
the poor and the elderly to protec-
tion of U.S. workers in plants,
Congress was able to pass moch

of their legislation with bipartisan
support. Despite this, they leave
as their legacy the most visible
flaw of the government of the
1980’s, a growing federal deficit.

_ Business

On Wall Street, the newest
game in town seems to be giant
leveraged buy-outs of large suc-
cessful companies. After last
week’s $11.4 billion buy-out of-
ter by the Phillip Morris Compa-
nies for Kraft, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. have offered $20.6
billion to buy-out R.J.R. Nabisco.

Animal Interest

Rescue efforts continue as
workers try to save the lives of
two California gray whales
trapped in the ice off the coast of
Alaska. The whales, surrounded
by ice two miles offshore, lin-
gered too long before migrating
south for the winter and are now
limited to small breathing holes
sawed in the ice by rescue work-
ers. Efforts to break up the ice
with boats have proved unsuc-
cessful and they are presently
trying to hammer a passageway
the open sea.
