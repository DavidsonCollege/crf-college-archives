We need a new Union

_ MONDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1996

I almost fell out of my chair
this past week as I turned to the
Opinions section of The
Davidsonian and found that
Ainsley Natta, the “1 in 1618” stu-
dent of the week, wanted to see an
article written about whether or
not there is a need for a new Stu-
dent Union building. I thought to
myself, “Of course there’s a need.
How could anyone question it?”
But then I realized that most stu-
dents probably don’t think about
the possibilities for the new Stu-
dent Union unless particular expe-
rience has prompted it, or unless
they have had the opportunity to
view the feasibility study (or struc-
tural possibilities) of the new
Union. So if I may humbly share

my experiences as well as my
dreams, I think, Ainsley, that you
may be convinced.

Let me preface my ideas with
a note of caution that the new Stu-
dent Union will not be built any

time soon(i.e., probably not within.

the next 5 years or so), despite
popular belief. The Trustees have

_ Made the new Union the number

one priority after the new Life Sci-
ences building has been completed.
Since we have not even seen the
groundwork for that building yet,
and it will take a massive amount
of fundraising to actually convert
Johnson Gym to a new Union, I’m
not going to hold my breath.

So anyway, why do we needa
new Student Union? Well, the is-

sue is a multi-faceted one. It in-
volves several aspects of student
life, including gender and race re-
lations, campus programming
needs and the structural setup of
the current building.

First, this campus needs a so-
cial outlet for members of the op-
posite sex to interact in a setting
other than Patterson Court. Not
that there’s anything wrong with
Patterson Court, but we need some
place for males and females to just
hang out and chat without the pres-
ence of alcohol or the looming
threat of a potential hook up. I
think that the new Student Union
could provide such a setting, spe-
cifically because it will hopefully
include more lounge and “hanging

out” space, like the current Cafe or
TV lounge.

Second, race relations on this
campus need the same opportunity
for comfortable chatting and inter-
action on a neutral basis (i.e., not
BSC or the fraternities).

Third, there are hundreds of
quirks about the Union which make
it an inopportune setup for a Stu-
dent Union — afterall, it used to be
a library! Some of the countless
nooks and crannies in the building
remain unseen by a majority of the
student body, which means that
most students cannot take full ad-
vantage of their own Student
Union.

Fourth, did you know the
building leaks?

Fifth, there is simply not
enough space for all of the student
offices. Some of them are now
tucked away in one of those nooks
or crannies, and you'll be lucky if
you find them within 15 minutes of
searching. Doyou know where the
PCC Office is? How about SGA?

Sixth, the building needs to be
much more of an inviting and hos-
pitable Student Union, intended to
bring students together in a com-
fortable and casual manner.

I could probably think of at
least a dozen more reasons, but I
think six is enough. I hope my
point is clear that a new Student
Union is not only a good idea, it is
an absolute necessity for a school
of Davidson’s caliber.

Professors go
above and beyond

At Davidson we’re usually
pretty good at picking out the
things that we think needimprove-
ment. Unfortunately, I’m not sure
‘that we do such a great job at
recognizing some of the aspects
of Davidson that deserve appre-
ciation. Therefore, I’d like to take
this chance to thank the many
Davidson professors who have
truly affected the lives of their
students.

In addition to passing on a
wealth of knowledge in the class-
room, professors who fit,this de-
scription in my mind stand apart
from the rest because of their ac-
tions and attitudes outside of the
classroom. With this in mind, I’d
like to list what I consider charac-
teristics describing Davidson’s
most outstanding faculty mem-
bers.

1. Professors who ask “How you
are doing?” and really mean it.
Even better, professors who make
you feel comfortable enough to
answer something other than
“Fine.”

2. Professors who hope all their
students will make A’s. My fa-
vorite classroom experiences have
been those in which I could tell
without a doubt that the professor
really wanted his or her students
to do well.

3. Professors who learn names

quickly and remember them even
when the semester is over. I know
this must be a difficult achieve-
ment, but a special thank you to
those who can do it!

4. Professors who appreciate that -

their students’ time is important
too. We know that our teachers
have busy schedules, personal lives
and issues to deal with once they
leave campus for the day. We
understand that sometimes it takes
awhile to grade our papers. Simi-
larly, we like to use our time wisely
— not doing busy work, spending
Fall Break studying for atest sched-
uled for the first day back, or run-
ning late because a professor held
class ten minutes over.

5. Professors who are so excited
about what they are teaching that
they impart their enthusiasm to
their students. We have some very
gifted teachers at Davidson, and
their classes are most interesting
when we can tell how much they
love to be teaching. -

6. Professors who participate and
take pride in the life of the college
community. I love to see profes-
sors at athletic events, choir con-
certs, or student theater produc-
tions. The list could go on and on
— students love to know that their
professors are interested in what
they do outside of attending their
classes. ;

7. Professors who really believe
in office hours. I can think of few
Davidson professors who do not
excel in this category. I once had
a class with a professor who col-
lected schedules from every stu-
dent afid arranged his office hours
so that everyone in the class could
see him at least one time every
day if they needed to. I have to
admit, even at Davidson I was
floored by this! Everyone can’t
(and probably doesn’t need to) go
that far, but I appreciate the con-
scious effort of the entire faculty
to make office hours an available
and helpful resource for their stu-
dents.

Things like this make
Davidson a special and wonder-
ful place.

I know that professors and
students expect a lot from one
another at Davidson, and I may
have listed an impossible set of
outstanding professor qualifica-
tions. My own experiences with
faculty at Davidson, however,

have been overwhelmingly posi- |

tive. Many professors try their
best to do all of the above.

We appreciate and thank
those that take advantage of the
special opportunities at Davidson
to explore the many teaching and
learning activities that exist out-
side of the weekly classroom.

FACULTY VOICE

We have no Faculty Voice this week, but we hope that
this column can continue to give Davidson students
perpectives from all sides of campus. If you area

I would look for students to work on friendships outside of the Court
and the classroom — on an informal basis. The school should get
involved in introducing co-ed dorms and more things to do in the
Union, but not on weeknights when everyone is so busy.
