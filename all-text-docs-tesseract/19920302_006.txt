Coach Rescinds Resignation, Renews Fight

LAS VEGAS, Nev. (CPS) - Jerry
Tarkanian is giving new meaning
to the phrase “going out with a
bang.”

The University of Nevada at
Las Vegas men’s basketball coach,
scheduled to step down March 3,
says he is rescinding his resigna-
tion. Tarkanian announced the
latest in the ongoing soap opera
after a 2-1/2 hour rally Feb. 23.

In a written statement, Tar-
kanian said he was tired of watch-
ing himself, his staff, his family
and his former players “trashed
again and again by a series of un-
truths, distortions and inaccura-
cies.”

Tarkanian’s resignation last
June came about after a newspaper
ran a photo of three former Run-
nin’ Rebels players sitting in a hot
tub with convicted sports fixer
Richard Perry.

The controversy surrounding
the resignation served to highlight
asparring match between the coach
and UNLV president Robert
Maxson, who accepted the resig-
nation and said he has no intention
of allowing Tarkanian back on the

court after March 3, his last sched-
uled game as an UNLV coach.

“There is a state Statute in
Nevada that says you have only
three days to take back a resigna-
tion,” said Joe Hawk, UNLV sports
information director. “Maxson is
the only person who can legally
allow (Tarkanian) to rescind his
resignation. He has no plans to do
that.”

Tarkanian’s attorneys now
claim, however, that a binding
agreement between Tarkanian and
Maxson that said neither side would
“bad mouth” the other has been
violated by the UNLV administra-
tion.

The attorneys said administra-
tors intentionally leaked problems
and violations within the basket-
ball program to the press and that
such a move violated the agree-
ment, giving Tarkanian the legal
option to rescind the resignation.

Those violations include 29
alleged National Collegiate Ath-
Ietic Association infractions cur-
rently under investigation. In
addition, the Las Vegas Review
Journal has reported that the FBI

and the federal Organized Crime
Task Force are investigating point-
shaving allegations against last
year’s team.

This year’s basketball team has
been banned from television and
postseason play as a final resolu-
tion of a 14-year fight between the
NCAA and Tarkanian.

On Feb. 19, the players voted
to sue the NCAA in an attempt to
get into the NCAA postseason
tournament. The team has already
clinched the school’s 10th straight
Big West Conference champion-
ship.

While Tarkanian continues to
fight with Maxson, the NCAA is
being forced to hold off on its
current investigation of possible
violations. The NCAA has filed
suit against Tarkanian and three
otherschallenging the constitution-
ality ofa state law thatholds NCAA

dards.
