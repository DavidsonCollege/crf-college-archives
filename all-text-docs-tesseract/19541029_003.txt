idle bystander, the
game between David-
son and West Virginia
Tech tomorrow might
appear to be only a mi-
nor part of one of Dav-
idson’s three dance
week-ends. With two
i big dances, a concert
after the game, and
numerous parties go-
ing on, the game would
seem to be amt interest-
ing sidelight in a hur-
ried week-end. But
' such is not the case.
Tomorrow afternoon's
s¢rap between the Bears and the Wildcats still remains as the
highlight of the activities for the majority of the people who
will witness the game. For the incoming alumni, it will once
more afford the chance to see old friends and to see David-
son football. And this year, the Wildcats can offer them
something more than a beaten-up crew which has little hope
of winning. The ’54 club is favored to become the first David-
son team in 14 years to win a homecoming contest. Since
1940, Davidson alumni have returned to their alma mater
year after year, only to see Wildcat clubs upset in close con-
tests or beaten badly. °
The Davidson seniors this year have seen the Wildcats go
down to defeat on three homecoming occasions, with all of
the games going down to the wire and being decided on extra
points. Presbyterian has beaten the Cats twice, and Furman
has had one decision. But this year’s seniors seem to have
an excellent chance of becoming the first Davidson senior
class in a long while to graduate having seen a homecoming
in.

‘The game will mark the first appearance on the Davidson
campus of the Golden Bears of West Virginia Tech. Few peo-
ple in this area know very much about the West Virginia
school, and the Bears remain pretty much of an “unknown
quantity.” Davidson coaches have scouted the team in two
encounters and have gotten a pretty good idea of what to
expect, but the fans will be in the dark as far as tactics of
the Bears are concerned. The Tech team passes a lot (32 at-
tempts in last week’s game) and this should make for a wide-
open battle.

* s e e

After hearing a few bitter remarks by members of the
student body about last week’s game against Furman, we feel
that something should be said about the contest. Davidson
went into the battle as a two-touchdown underdog, and when
the final gun had sounded, they had lost by two touchdowns.
The Davidson team played as hard a game as any this season,
and this statement is borne out by the fact that the Wildcat

line made two tremendous goal line stands, something for |-

which Davidson clubs are definitely not famous. The David-
son starting line averaged 197 Ibs., the highest for the season,
but the Furman line was heavier. This, in part, made it pos-
sible for Popson and Yakimowicz to make the gains that they
did. But there is no denying that the two Hurricane half-
backs lived up to their reputations, and this was certainly
no fault of the Davidson team. The Wildcats got some bad
breaks, but they played a good game, and definitely improved
on that 34-0 score of last year by a Furman team that wasn’t
as good as this year’s club. We have no reason to criticize,
and nothing to be ashamed of.

Cats Fight Hard:
Bul Furman Wins

BY LEON HOWELL

Charlotte saw the Davidson
Wildcats for the first time since
1949 last Friday night, and they
saw the comeback operation jolt-
ed by Furman’s Purple Hurricane.
However, defeat at the hands of
powerful Furman was no disgrace,
and the team played well as a
whole.

On this crisp fall night, David-
son’s student body appeared to turn
out almost en masse, and they had
scarcely seated themselves when
Davidson turned on the fireworks.
After taking the opening kickoff,
the Cats went into a spread and
fired several passes in succession.
On the second series that Davidson
had the ball, it seemed as if it
would pay dividends when Gram-
ley hauled in a long pass. Unfor-
tunately, he lost the ball when
tackled, and Furman recovered it.

For the rest of the half, Furman
controlled the ball, with Davidson
caught with its back to the wall
several times. As the first quarter
drew to a close, Popson, Furman’s
great halfback, bulled over for
their initial tally: The extra point
attempt was blocked.

Striking again as the half ran

out, Boyle threw a long pass to
the other half of Furman's “dyna-
mite duo,” Yakimowicz, who scor-
ed without breaking stride. After
adding the extra point, the Hurri-
eane took the half-time intermis-
sion, leading 13 to 0.
The third quarter went much as
the first half, with Boyle finally
hitting Popson with a touchdown
pass. Davidson began rolling in
the last frame, cutting Henry
Brown loose over the right side for
a 33-yard scamper for the score.
Bob “The Toe” Talbert booted the
point.

Coach Dole was of the opinion
that his boys had played good ball,
but the mistakes made; fumbles,
dropped passes, penalties, and a
riddled pass defense proved cost-
ly against a team as strong as
Furman. Davidson’s up-the-middle
defense looked very good at times,
particularly on two sparkling goal
line stands. Popson and Yakim-
owicz were the chief offenders to
Davidson's defensive average,

grinding out 153 yards between
them in 36 carries.

Dole Hopes To Break
Long Homecoming Jinx

BY BUNNY PERKINSON

The Golden Bears of West Virginia Tech invade the cam-
pus today for tomorrow’s Homecoming game with our Wild-
cats in which the 'Cats hope to break a 13-game losing streak
in Homecoming contests. The Bears, coached by Don
bring a team about which little is known, except that they are
big and tough. The line averages 196 lbs. per man and the
backs average about 185, the biggest man on the team. being
240-pound right tackle, Jim Welker.

Coach Phillips himself was a

standout tackle at Wheaton Col-|°

lege, Wheaton, Ill., where he was
an all-conference performer in
1941. He is assisted by Ralph Tate
and Neal Baisi, giving the Bears a
véry competent coaching staff.

The Bears perform in the West
Virginia Intercollegiate Confer-
ence, which is “composed of most
of the colleges in the state, with
the University of West Virginia
being an outstanding exception.
Tech is located in Montgomery, W.
Va., and the school has about 638
students enrolled this year.

In their last outing, the Bears
lost to a tough Morris Harvey Col-
lege eleven, perennially one of
the top teams in the conference.
The score was 33 to 6, and Davad-
son coach Chuck Clments was pres-
ent to view the goings-on. The of-
fense of the Bears revolves around
195-pound Bob Burruss, who is re-
ported to be a fine passer. The
seventy-odd plays run last week
included 32 pass plays, so Coach
Dole has been drilling the ’Cats
on pass defense all week. The run-
ning of former Washington and
Lee fullback Eddie Landis and 185
ibs. halfback Delmar Dixon also is
a strong point.

Coach Phillips has a young team,
with only two seniors, Burruss and
Landis, on the starting eleven. The
36-man squad is composed of a to-
tal of three seniors, six juniors,
eleven sophomores, and sixteen
freshmen.

The 'Cats are in exceptionally
good physical condition for the
scrap, and all the regulars are ex-
pected to see some action. As has
been the custom all season, the
‘Cats will be deployed into two
platoons. With a win tomorrow,
the ’Cats will virtually be assured
of finishing above .500 for the sea-
son, having to win only one of the
last three games to do so.

As the inter-fraternity football
season is entering the final stages,
the Kappa Sigs and KAs still re-

that clash will be the feature tilt
of the season.
