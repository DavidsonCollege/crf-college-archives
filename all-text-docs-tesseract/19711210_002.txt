Kelton, Walls Experiment

With Skinner Locked Doors

Davidson psychology profes.
sors John D. Kelton and Russell
E. Walls have published an ar-
ticle based on data gathered at
Davidson College in the presti-
gous Journal of Experimental
Psychology.

The article, ‘‘Walls’ Door
Theory,” is based on five years
of experimentation under con-
trolled conditions on the David-
son campus. Kelton explained
the situation as ‘the locked
door-unlocked door experiment.
We were testing the strength of
place learning phenomena as
opposed to response learning.”

Walls explained the actual
experimental situation. ‘‘We
used the standard Skinner type.

periment were selected to avoid
biased results, we used the
union, the library, and Cham-
bers Building, but the doors
were randomly selected. We
never did see any SAE’s though.
As you entered the buildings.
the left door was always lock-
ed: the doors were the mani-
pulable variables.”

Kelton indicated that the pur-
pose of the study was to deter-
mine the behavioral set.

**We wanted to see if the stu-
dents could be programed to
always go to the right door
whether it is locked or not. You
know, after five years we got
a lot of laughs out of the ex-
periment: it was kind of funny
to see students getting frus-
trated and banging into doors.”

Kelton indicated that the two

Palmer of the Davidson psycho-
logy department in a follow up
study. ‘‘We thought that it would
be interesting to lock.both doors
and see if we could just maybe

college students. Its a lot like

might say we’re using ’Cats our-

The two have been asked to
write a popular version of their

Walls indicated that he was
quite receptive to the idea.

In addition to Cohen, spend-
ing a year's sabatical from the
University of California at Ber-
keley, Davidson professors Earl
MacCormac and John Young
will also participate.

Cohen, a close personal friend
of MacCormac’s from under-
graduate days at Yale Univer-
sity, is the author of a large
number of scholarly works in-
cluding ‘'A Differential Seman-
tics for Syntactical Organiza-
tion.” “Linguistic Analysis in
Primitive Rainfall Cultures,”
and “‘The Chinese Method of
Kite Construction.”

In addition to his years on
the faculties of Penn. Brown
and Berkeley, Cohen has serv-
ed. as a_ presidential trouble-
Shooter in the Federal Bureau
of Language and Education. A
Rhodes scholarship winner, Co-
hen is still a nationally rank-

as a possible successor to Jose

Cohen will address several
philosophy classes during his
three days on the Davidson cam-
pus. His address to the sym-
posium will be “I and You and

approach to aesthetics.

The symposium will follow a

Johnston stated that students
in the Honors College will con-
tinue to receive academic cred-
it ‘for what work that they do
during the winter and spring
terms. ‘‘We made a commit:
ment to the students and we
didn’t feel we could. in ali hon-
esty, pull the rug out from un-
der them.”

According to Johnston. the
Carolina Inn. which is now be-
ing used by the Honors College.
will be converted into a faculty
lounge. “I felt that a faculty

lounge would be the most ap-
proprate use for a_ building
like the Inn.” Johnston explain-
ed.

“I do want to make perfectly
clear. however, that the Caro.
lina Ian ean stilt be used by
the student body for meetings
and for lectures and other such
activities, At this point, I think
that this would be the best use
of the building.” Johnston said.

“] think that these changes
can be implemented without too
much d sruption of the College's
resources,” Johnston added.

good faith.” he said.

Perhaps the key point of the
proposal is the merger of
Queens and Davidson in the
Space of three years time.

Queens has agreed. pending
approval of th proposal by the
Davidson Board of Trustees and
their own board. to admit no
freshmen for the 1972-73 sehool
year. Queens will maintain their
operations for the next vear.
but will phase their two re-
maining classes into the David-
son student body for the 1973-
74 academic year.

Spencer and Bevan both sta-
ted that they saw no difficulty
in absorbing the two classes
from Queens.

Queens will liquidate its val-
uable holdings in Charlotte's
posh Myers Park section. The
Mint Museum has expressed
considerable interest in several
of the buildings. Tre dormi-
tories will be remodeled an
used as apartments for young
married couples.

Bevan also indicated that the
majority of the Queens faculvy
will be incorporated into the
Davidson faculty to cover the
increased enrollment. ‘In addi-
tion to expanding the numbers

of our faculty, the addition of

then the departments which
could be expected to have in-
creased enrollment with coed-
ucalion,” Bevan noted.

C. David Cornell. vice presi-
dent of finance and development,
said that the could see no ma-
jor financial difficulties in the
proposal as written.

“E have talked with most of
the college's major contributors
and they seem to have no strong
objections to coeducation. 1
think that we can have coed-
ucation and not lose any of the
financial support that the col-
lege has now. at least if we
lose some sources, we can make
it up with others.”

The proposal calls for an en-
rollment of 1750 in the 1973-74.
Cornet! did indicate that plans
were being drawn up for ex-
Pansion of existing dormitories,
but that for the next two or
three years off campus housing
would have to be expanded.

The trustees are expected to

Wednsday or Friday, with final
dtails to be worked out this
weekend by Warner Hall, chair-
man of the board, and Greg
Scott, assistant to the president.
