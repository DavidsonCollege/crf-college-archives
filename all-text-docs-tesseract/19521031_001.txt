Petition Goes |,

Rounds in Cuts)
Change Move;

The petition which requests the
banning of double cuts for the two
days of classes immediately follow-
ing Christmas vacations is now
being circulated.

The proposal would have the

cuts for the two days in question |.

count as single cuts rather than
double as the present system re-
quires.

President Jack Ruth said that
the petition will be presented to
the proper adminisrative body,
probably the Executive Commit-
tee, as soon as the petition has
been signed by sufficient number
of students,

It was not possible to bring
the paper before the Executive
Committee at its monthly
meeting on Wednesday of this
week, because there was not
time to complete the petition.

The ‘move to prepare the petition
was the result of the first closed
meeting of the student body held
in Wednesday's chapel. There a
number of possibilities were pre-
sented, but the conclusion was that:
little could be done about the sit-
uation in which many students’ are
forced to travel from home to col-
Jege on January first.

This question arose after student
ire had been aroused by the pros-
pect of traveling on that day and
in some cases even earlier and the
Davidsonian editor in chief, with

held its regular mecting last Wed-
nesday night. The main order of
business consisted of making plans
for the coming year.

The date for the next play has
been set and is December 5 and 6.
The production will probably be
one of the following: “Laburnum
Grove,” “Yellow Jack,” or fossi-
bly “Hasty Heart.” Other produc-
tions are planned fog next spring,
including a Shakespearean classic.

The Masquers are badly in need
of new talent, inasmuch as so many

All those students having dra-
matic aspirations are urged to join
in these productions.

Film Society Shows
French Picture

“Zero De Conduite,” to be shown
November 5, at 8:30 p.m., in Cham-
bers Auditorium, will be the second
picture of the United Literary
Film Society's fall series.

Written and directed by Jean
Vigo, “Zero De Conduite” is an
explosive, yet delightful story of
revolt in a boys’ boarding school,
depicted through a series of ironic,
poetic and merciless epsiodes.

As is the case with many artists,
Vigo was not appreciated in his
own country until well after his
“Zero” having been
banned in France for sixteen years
as “being alleged to give a libellous
picture of French. school life.” To-
day, it is acknowledged by the
French press as one of their class-
ics. The musical score is by Mau-
rice Jaubert.

Season membership tickets for
those who have not yet obtained
them will be on sale at the door.

“WE STILL LIKE IKE,” POLL FINDS
AMONG STUDENTS, FACULTY

“We still like Ike,”

was the word from the recent straw

vote held among students and faculty. In a near replay of last
spring's preferential vote which then saw Eisenhower ahead, the
students picked the General by a near three to one margin—
359 for Eisenhower, and 129 for Stevenson.

With the faculty the story was
again Eisenhower by a large ma-
jority. Ike polled 34 votes to Adlai's
13, with one undecided.

Of the students voting only 113
said they were registered, while
tue faculty had only three voters
not eligible to vote.

Here is a rundown of the poll:

Students Faculty
Eisenhower 359 x«
Stevenson 129 13
TOTAL .... 488 47

There was one undecided voter
among the faculty and the students
turned in numerous unmarked bal-
lots.

Some comments by students on
the voting were gathered by your
reporter:

Bill Bradford: “I voted for. Ike

and the Republican party for the
reason that I think there is too
much Socialism in the Democratic.

party.”

Ben Craig: “I voted for Ike be-
cause Dickie Davis voted for
Adlai.”

Dickie Davis: “I voted for Adlai
because Ben Craig voted for tke."

Lawrence Erwin: “I voted for
Ike because I believe he will wind
up this darn war and keep me out
of Korea.”

A. C. Gregg: “I'm for Adlai be-
cause he has a good domestic
policy and his foreign policy is as
good as Ike's foreign policy. Ike is
nothing but a military leader.”
