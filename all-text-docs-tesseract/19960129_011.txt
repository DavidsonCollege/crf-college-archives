Watch out: Tori‘s got a sun

Boys for Pele proves to be both powerful and

By JoHN CopENHAVER

Before I purchased Tori
Amos’s new CD, Boys for Pele, I
had a chance to listen to the first
release, “Caught A Lite Sneeze.”
During this song she sings, “caught
alite sneeze/ dreamed alittle dream/
made my own pretty hate ma-
chine.” After hearing these lyrics,
and reading about Tori’s breakup
with her boyfriend, Eric Rosse, co-
producer of her last two albums, I
had an idea what to expect from the
new album: Trent Reznor’ sPretty
Hate Machineserved up Toristyle.
And I was right — at least to a
certain extent. :

Leaning back in a rocking
chair, legs splattered with mud,
hunting rifle in hand, Tori stares,
glassy-eyed and angry, out from
her CD cover. The first impres-
sion that flew through my head
was: Ohno! Watch out! Tori’s
mad — and she’s got a gun.

After listening to the album,
the most pervasive mood was not
anger, but sadness — and finally
resolution. Throughout her previ-
ous albums, Little Earthquakes,
1991 and Under the Pink, 1994,
Tori structured many of her songs
so that they start witha piano, layer
on different instruments, and cul-
minate in powerful vocals. She ar-
ranges her songs to grow gradually
and climax in epiphany-like mo-
ments, bringing the listener in and
demanding his or her full attention
until the end.

Eighteen songs long,Boys for
Pele, contains some of Tori’s best
work. The range and variety of
songs demonstrates a significant
growth and successful experimen-
tation, which speaks highly for her
ability and maturity as an artist.

Tori Amos’ new album

unique

In four songs, “Blood Roses,”
“Professional Widow,” “Caught a
Lite Sneeze,” and “Talula,” she
blends the baroque, aristocratic
sound of a harpsichord, the metal-
lic beat of a druni machine, and her
smooth, whispering voice into a
highly unlikely, but successful
combination. She also uses horns,
strings, and guitars — among other
unusual instruments —to give each
song a distinct and memorable
sound. .“‘Putting the Damage On”
combines brass and piano to pro-
duce a brilliant and moving piece
of music. Other songs such as
“Little- Amsterdam” and “In the
Springtime of his Voodoo” have a
jazzy, upbeat feel that contrasts
well with her slower, more moody
songs.

The problem with this album
is that it came out too early. Many
of her songs could have been

worked over, allowing the mixing
of instruments and vocals to be
more precise. Her voice, at times,
loses itself in the instruments, fad-
ing into the background when it
should be full and in the foreground.
My only other complaint is that
she still keeps her lyrics incredibly
cryptic. If she decoded her lyrics
for her audience, she would open
up a new world for her listeners,
and, I believe, drive home her
points more successfully.

Withouta doubt, Boys for Pele .

is a must for Amos fans, but it is
also proof that Tori took advan-
tage of experimentation and ex-
plored her musical medium in an
untraditional manner. She has cre-
ated and produced an album that is
as unique as it is accomplished and
powerful. It can be honestly said
that no musician out there is quite
like her.

Chill

from page 10

from the stage as cooks plugged
their personal creations and tasters
wandered through the room sam-
pling and socializing.

Among the assortment of chil-
is were all vegetable dishes, a
“white chili” with chicken, and of
course the meat and beans stand-
by. However, contestants did man-
age to add a few unexpected ingre-
dients. The reactions? Well, let’s
just put it this way: there were

plenty of “oohs” and “aahs,” a few
red faces, and an occasional mad
dash to the water pitcher. One
,crowd favorite was “sexual choco-
late” from the kitchen of Casey
Hawthorn and Kevin Gaunt. The
team later received an honorable
mention.

The vegetarian favorite was
Miles’ chili,” said a table of name-
less and impartial guests. How-
ever, whether they came for the
social aspect, to support an amigo,
or just to have a big bowl of good
chili, everyone agreed that the
cook-off was the perfect escape
for a wintry night, and a great time
was had by all.
