Peeples

By DOUG BROWN
Staff Writer

Davidson's “Service Infor-
inat'on Center" officially be-
$49 Cperating Tuesday, Jan-
vary 26. It will attempt to
educate the ‘community
about the Se’ective Service
Sysiem. Greg Scott, Presi-
dent of the YMCA, and Col-
toge Chanlin Scott Woodman-
see were instrumental. in
formulating plans for this
center,

Begining in October, con-
cre.e plans were made about
forming a draft counseling
service, and Raph: Peeples
was named to head it.

The ‘Service Information
Center" is under the auspi-
ces of the YIMCA, and it
should cost less than $50.00
to operate the first year. The
only major expenditures will
be for draft literature.

Peeples has set a number
of goals which he hopes to
see realized. He wants to
educate individuals about
military service, explain to
them how to get a conscien-
tious objector status if one
is desired, explain the types
of deferments, and explain
the obligations and opportu-
nities of military service.

Colonel Foster of the ROTC
Department has offered his
assistance in explaining the
possibliities for military
service. Peeples — stressed
that this service was non-

political in nature, and that

“We want to
easier for guyS“to make a
proper evaluation of the
Selective Service System and
to let them know all the
options which are open to
them,’’ said Peeples.

Specific questions about
the draft law and its pro
cedures will be answered. If
the answers to these pro-
blems cannot’ be found at
Davidson, ‘The Service In-
formation Center'’ will be
able to find out from other

sources. &.

make it

Currently, Peeples is the’

only person actively involv-
ed in draft counseling, but
he hopes to see the num-
ber increase. ‘‘Where we go
from here will depend on
the interest shown by the
people here on campus,’
commented Peeples.

There is now a training
session in progress for ‘those
who desire to become invol-
ved in draft counseling, and
eight people are in it; In

_ late February a group from

the American ‘Friends will
visit campus and offer ad-
vice about the Selective
Service System.

A mock draft board can
be set up for those who
would like to-gain experience

before facing their draft
boards. Also some sa mple
questions asked by local

draft boards of conscientious

objectors are available. Al-
so some faculty members
have offered to help in this
area,

According to Peeples,
there has been a_ general
feeling of cooperation by
all parties. However, this
service has not been publi-
cized previously, and Peep-
les felt that some publicity
might be useful.

In the future, (Peeples
wants to see this draft coun-
seling service spread to the
community and not ~serve
only Davidson College.

“The students are fairly
well protected. It is very im-
portant to help the poor, un-
educated guy to make the
right decision. We are avail-
able to tell which service is
best, and we should be able
to help ‘him if he desires to
put off serving for awhile,"
said Peeples.

He noted that a problem
of communication presently
exists. ‘

“We are not a draft eva-.

Heads Draft Counseling —

_ it was neither pro nor anti

sion or resistance service.
This is not encouraged, but
we do have addresses of
such agencies if they are de-
sired,"’ commented Peeples.
Peeples stressed that this
was against the law, and he
did not want to get involved
with that issue.

Peeples» wants to get all
types of individuals involved
in the program, and he espe-
cially pointed out those en-
rolled in ROTC. This is in
keeping with the goal of
serving as a source for all
types of information.

Draft literature is avail-
able in the YIMCA office,
and those seeking personal
guidance can get in touch
with Ralph Peeples in Belk
258.

There will be a file locat-
ed outside of the YIMCA of-
fice where written questions
can be placed. ‘‘This is a
part time thing to us, but
we are serious about it,”’
said Peeples. There is no
charge for this service.
