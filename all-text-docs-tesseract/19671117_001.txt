“PLAYING THE ROLE OF METTERNICH”
Morgenthau flays U.S. policies.

To Charlotte,
And Beyond

By SAM BOYTE

Editor-in-Chief
Dr. Hans Morgenthau was to be picked up at the
college Guest House at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday. By 12:25
p.m. his bags were waiting on the porch, and he was

waiting on the walkway.

He said he left with a good impression of David-
son students, but he was ready to go.
He expected to have his bags carried by someone

else, and, when they
were, he set a brisk pace
to meet the car that Bill
Bondurant, assistant to
the president, was driv-
ing towards him.

The bucket - seated. navy
blue Grand Prix drew Mor-
genthau’s praise. Bondurant
acknowledged the praise with
a couple of jests about the
car's expense and headed to-
wards Charlotte for lunch and
Morgenthau’s plane for New
Orleans. |

Morgenthau has a Roman
nose, piercing eyes and close-
ly clipped white hair. He
stands with a dignity and

bearing uncommon in men of
short, pudgy stature—the type
that a professor of political
science is expected to have.

Because he is a German
native, he might be expected
to say “‘sie’’ instead of ‘‘the,”’
and. he does.

He said it several times in
the sense of ‘‘sie liberal arts
college’ as Bondurant asked
philosophical questions about
the future of colleges like Da-
vidson.

_ Morgenthau dismissed the
questions with the conclu-
sion that the liberal arts col-
lege must be relevant to be

OBSOLESCENCE SCt

By CHUCK GREEN
Staff Writer
A new foreign policy for
the United States was advo-
cated here this week by a
noted political historjan.

According to Dr. Hans
Morgenthau, the year's first
Reynolds Lecturer, U.S. pol-
icy has become ‘obsolete. It
was fashioned 20 years ago
to contain the Soviet Union
with a wall of force. but the
world has radically chang-
ed.”

The United States - still

views communism as a mon

dlithic force, Morgenthau
said, and this view “has led
us astray throughout the
world.’ There are now many
different communisms, he
said, and the one in Europe
that the U.S. is familiar with
is “utterly insufficient for
understanding the reality of
communism in Asia.”

Morgenthau. a professor at
the University of Chicago
and former adviser to the
departments of State and De-
fense, made two speeches—
Monday night in Hodson Hall
and Tuesday in chapel--as
well as meeting informally.
with various student groups.

Present U.S. policy was
separated by Morgenthau in-
to five “problem areas”:
U.S. allies, the Communist
world, the uncommitted
world, nuclear weapons and
the United States.

An Atlantic alliance based
on U.S. nuclear superiority
was constructed in the late
1940's and then destroyed
when Russia developed the

The action came within a
month of the announcement
that the Board of Trustees
had approved the erection of
a new library on the site of
the Manor.

However, construction on
the library is not scheduled
to ‘begin for another three
years.

Explaining the action fur-
ther, the epilogue also term-
ed Lingle Manor a_ failure
and cited a bope of bringing
attention to the lack of alter-
natives as one reason for the
sudden action.

At the time of the action.
the group had six members,
a decline of 13 from last
spring. When it was first or-
ganized on May 4, 1962, the
Manor had more than 50
members.

Dr. W. G. Workman. chair.
man of the faculty Commit-
tee on the College Union.
Fraternities and Clubs, has
expressed tentative approval
of the action, according to a
spokesman.for the group.

The provisions adopted in-
cluded a requirement for
conferring with Warkman.
and provided for automatic
reconsideration should he dis-
agree.

The faculty committee had
been discussing possible al-
ternatives to the Manor since
the board's announcement.

**From then on, it was pos.
sible for us to get involved
in a conflict in which west

Communism is now “poly
centric,’ he said. ‘‘Individ
ual national interest deter
mines the policies, and so
communism must be evalu
ated and dealt with on an in
dividual basis."

U.S. problems concerning

undeveloped nations include
a too general application of
foreign aid and alliance with
others ‘‘out of a mortal fear
of communism.’* We oppose
revolution because commun

ed. “destroyed the rational
relationship of violence as a

defense is a defense at all,"

areas, he said. and in con

is that it destroys them in
the process,”’ he said.

“A strong Vietnam. Com

effective barrier to Chinese
power . In the ‘long run,
it’s not probable that a for
eign policy that hurts na
tionalistic feelings will -be
successful,”

But the most important
problem. Morgenthau Said, is

coming to grips with our-
selves. ‘‘There is no doubt
that our priorities as a na-
tion are in disarray ... In-
volvement in Vietnam has
deflected our attention from
more important foreign and
domestic problems.”

‘We must ask ourselves
again. as many great Amer-
icans have, ‘Why does this
nation exist'?"' The answer to
that, Morgenthau said, will
“determine the future of the
world.”

Politicians
May Speak
About OEO

Rep. James Gardner, R
N.C.. and Rep. Nick Galifi-
anakis, D-N.C., have been jn-
vited to speak here during
second semester.

Student Council President
Tom’ Earnhardt addressed
letters to the two members of
the U.S. House of Represent-
atives inviting them to speak
on their views on the Office
of Economic Opportunity pro
gram. They were given a
choice of dates in the spring.

The appearance of the con-
gressmen would mark the be.
ginning of a Student Council
program to provide several
political speakers for 1968, an
election year.

Earnhardt said the Student
Counci! had set aside funds
for this purpose and would
be able to finance the speak.
ers. He said that the council's
Monday chapel period would
be utilized and that the speak
ers would also appear at an
Open End progtam.

The two congressmen have
taken opposing sides on the
OEO issue. which is ‘national
in scope. Galifianakis is an
advocate of the program. but
Gardner launched a major
campaign against the pro.
gram in Durham this sum

Folk Singer Plays
Free Gift Concert

Josh White Jr. gave C.
Shaw Smith. director of the
College Union, a gift Wednes
day night that was received
by a more than capacity
crowd in the Morrison Room
of the Union. ,

The gift was a concert giv-
en free to the Union in ap-
preciation of Smith.

White’s manager, Chuck
Ramsey, said, “Shaw has
just done so much for us.
We've been wanting to do
this for some time, but this
was just the first weekend
that we were in the area.”

White is a folksinger who
has appeared at Davidson on
a number of occasions.

Ramsey said that he called
Tom L. Covington Jr., as.
sistant director of the Union.
Monday to have him make
arrangements for the con-
cert. The idea then would be
for White to walk in at 6
p.m. Wednesday to surprise
Smith with the announce-
ment that there would be a
concert in two hours.

hopes that we can prevent
the delay in publication which
occurred this year."

He said the general format

ing the staff maintains an
adequate budget. He men

Report Due Soon

Faculty Frontis Johnston
said.

Johnston explained that the
subcommittee itself did not
play a direct part in the Blue

was recently released. ‘‘Its
purpose,’ he said, ‘‘was to
study such conditions of stu-

system, fraternities and ath

Subcommittee Chairman
Bobby Lane said, ‘I hope the
report stimulates action in
the committees to which the
report was referred.”

Lane added, “There is a
good deal of value in the re-
port and I hope it doesn’t get
lost in administrative ma-
chinery.”"

evaluation ‘‘doubtless served
to trigger into action a long-
standing suspicion of many
of us that our historic pro-
gram has now become out-
ated and that it is time for a
change."

The first action was the
faculty's creation of a special
committee, later known as
the Blue Sky Committee. in
the spring of 1966. Its pur’
pose was to examine the cur-
riculum and draw up pro
posals for its revision.

The action was approved
by the Board of Trustees in
May of the same year, and
the Dean of the Faculty was
named as chairman of the
committee.

The committee met 46
times in formal session. The
members also worked on 11
subcommittees and on nu.
merous individual assign
ments.

Members made several
trips to other outstanding lib
eral arts colleges. Visitors
were also invited to Davidson

The final proposal which
was presented Tuesday was
preceded by a_ preliminary
report last spring.

This final proposal was
reached. as the report indi
cates, with remarkable unan
imity. The reception which it
has been accorded by stu
dents and faculty has also
been one of remarkable unan.
imity in its favor.

Dr. W. P. Minter, associ-
ate professor of political sci-
ence, said that he was ‘‘very
pleased with it. It makes the
whole Davidson program
more meaningful.”

He indicated that the social
science requirement would be
extremely valuable because
students would be introduced
to it at an earlier level.
