Automatic “A” Draws Dickinson Nay
Professor Ralph Sandler of Dickinson College

recently experimented with informing his students in

English $80 that all students would receive automatic

A's.

Sandler listed three reasons for his policy in a
statement given to The Dickinsonian, the student
newspaper. Sandler said that he opposed grading be-
cause it is used by teachers to intimidate students, it

laces too much emphasis on competition for an ‘‘ar-
itrarily assigned letter,” and “it is a false and de-
structive method” of disciplining students in a way
Sandler believes to be ‘antithetical to . . . the aims of

liberal education.”

The Dickinson faculty replied by issuing a state-
mert that all students in English 380 would receive
a grade of “A*”, with the asterisk referring to a foot-
note stating that the grade was given as “an experi-
ment in educational motivation.”

However, this compromise was noi aecepted by the
students in English 380 and was therefore negated,
as it had been made contingent upon their agreement.

One senior taking the course wrote a Setter to the
editor of The Dickinsonian stating that he felt that
the faculty committee which had suggested the com-
promise had perpetrated a tragedy when it thwarted
“such a potentially beautiful experiment.”

Lehigh IFC Discusses Blackball

The Interfraternity Council at Lehigh University
has three times tabled a motion to replace the black-
ball with a system in which 20 percent of the mem-
bership would have to vote against a rushee to prevent

his being accepted.

According to the student newspaper, the Brown
and White, it is unlikely that the motion will pass with
the necessary two-thirds majority. This prediction is
based on the results of a straw vote taken on. the pro-

posal.

The IFC president said that the fraternities are

opposed to the blackball, but do not want the IFC to

regulate their use of it.

Chapel Hill Cafeteria Workers Strike
Cafeteria workers at the University of North Caro-
Inia at Chapel Hill have walked off their jobs and call-
ed for a general boycott of the cafeterias.in an effort
to gain higher pay and better working conditions.
Members of the Black Student Movement at UNC..
CH are trying to help the workers but have not been
allowed to take part in negotiations between the uni-
versity and the workers, although they have attended

meetings. .

Apparently no students are among the workers

in the walkout.

Radcliffe Debates Absorption into Harvard
Radcliffe alumni are debating a proposal to be-
come completely absorbed. into Harvard College.
Radcliffe is the co-ordinate women’s ‘college of
Harvard. According to the New York Times, complete
integration with Harvard would be merely a con-
tinuation of Radcliffe’s progress since its founding.

The president of the Radcliffe alumni association
said that she saw two reasons for wondering about
the value of complete integration in Harvard. She
cited the possibilities that the thousand Radcliffe
girls might be swallowed up in the larger Harvard
student body and that the Radcliffe alumni might
not be able to enjoy themselves as much at reunions
which would include Harvard men.

This lady graduated from Radcliffe in 1920.

RESTRUCTURING POSSIBLE
Activities Fee Draws Study

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Editor-in-Chief
Increasing headaches in
the allocation of the $25 stu-
dent fee may spark a re-
structuring of the fee in the
near future, Business Manag-
er Robert A. Currie said

this week.

Demands on this year's
fee total $31,000, which is
$6,000 over income. Depend-
ing on the fee for part or
all of their support are the
publications, student govern.
ment and the artist series.

Currie catalogued the cur-
rent difficulties with the fee:

—Demands outstrip in-

come, but due to a policy of
several years, the fee is
protected from an increase
by the tcustees.

—The fee, even were it to
change, is set in October of
the year before it is used.
This prevents any editor or
student government presi.
deht from having a say in
the funding of his, own ad-
ministration. |

—Exactly what should be
supported by the fee is not
clear. Although the fee cur-
rently supports publications,
student government, and the
artists series, suggestions
have been expressed that the

To Study Abroad

By GEORGE PARK
Staft Writer

Next fall one of the largest
groups yet will leave David.
son to spend their junior year
abroad.

According to Dr. W. H.
Walker of the French Depart
ment, the popularity of the
Junior Year Abroad program
has increased steadily in the
last few years. There are
now more students that want
to study in France than the
program can accommodate.
Walker attributes the in.
creased interest in the pro-
gram partly to the greater
publicity it has received dur-
ing recent years.

The Hmit of 13 Davidson
students will study fin Mont-
pelier next syear. They are:
George Allen, David Buck.
Joe Coalter, Bennet Cowan.
Harlan Day. ‘David Eason.
Steve Engstrom. Al McGraw,
Roger Petersor, Norwood
Poland. Mike Roth, David
Sams. Tim Shuba. Homer
Sutton and John Taylor.

.

Three other students. Har-
rison Higgins. Bill New, and
Bill Pearsall applied for the

French Program. They will,

serve as alternates should
any of the students going
change his mind. Otherwise
these three may participate
in one of several programs
open to them at other
schools.

The 13 students who will be
studying at Marburg. Ger-
many, are: Dick Anderson,

posium be included, and the

—The Quips and Cranks is
faced with the question. of
whether to charge organiza-
tions for space jn the annual,
a practice long followed but
now under question.

The business "manager sug.
gested two ways around the
inflexibility of the fee, which
is for now made livable by
yearly college supplements
to the fee.

One way would be to let
the fee vary. being set in the
spring before the following
school year. In this case the
trustees would delegate to
the administration the right
to raise or lower the fee with-
in cettain bounds.

“That would leave under
trustee jurisdiction any ma.
jor change in the program."
Currie explained.

Because the first alterna
tive delays setting of the fee
past the catalogue printing
deadline, and makes it dif-
ficult for incoming students
to depend on definite college
costs, Currie. indicated he
favored a ‘‘planned reserve,”
from which funds could be
taken to supplement activi-
ties fund while the fee itself
was raised for the following
year.

Currie also raised the pro
blem of what was to be sup.

ported by the fee, and sug

gested that students should
set priorities in what they
preferred, and decide how
much support
willing to offer.

Citing suggestions to in
clude or exclude various
student activities, the college
treasurer said the “SGA is
going to have to define what
it wants in the activities
fee.”

He noted that the Red and
Black Masquers and the De.
baters had once been sup-
ported with the fee, but were
later dropped when funds
came in from the newly-
created Drama Department.

Even if the $31,000 request-
ed for this year is approved,
there is still the annual's
problem of organization pic-
tures.

The Q&C currently charges
each organization at a set
rate per page of the annual,
and some organizations have
tefused to pay for coverage.

pa.

If the organization fees are
dropped —~ and Currie hint-
ed this was a good possibi-
lity since they are seen as
unfair to students in several
organizations — another
$3,000 must be added to the

percent of the activities fee
now goes.

Hazing Not Permitted Here,
Terry Warns Fraternities

By PAUL ROWLAND

Fraternities this week got
a. reminder from their ad-
ministrative adviser that
“hazing” is strictly taboo at

Davidson.

would be to have them send
in a post card to be consider-
ed, but the results would not
be adequate.” he said.

This leads to the problem
of recruitment and White
says that the admissions of-
fice has ‘“‘been asking for
and receiving’ substantial
student help for the last five
or six years.”

“I think students are the
best recruiters you can have.
If a_ student can sell his
guidance counselor back
home on the quality of David-
son he has made a big con.
tribution. This is particularly
true in private schools.”

White said that he felt that
the new curriculum and other
recent changes at Davidson
will be positive factors in the
number of strong applications
received in the future. He
also noted that the success
of the basketball team in re-
cent years has contributed
beneficially to exposure for
Davidson.

Terry said. He added that
it would be a misdemeanor
for the college to shirk this
responsibility.

“It works both ways,”
Terry said, explaining that
the order would apply to

as shower parties by either

“Nothing has happened

Wildcat Den Seeks ABC
Approval Of Beer Sales

Less than a month after
the first alcoholic beverages
were sold legally in the town
of Davidson, the Wildcat Den
is applying for a permit to
sell beer and wine for con-
sumption on premises.

Mrs. Emma Payne, who
leases the restaurant on Main
Street from basketball coach
Lefty Driesell, posted notice
of her intention to make ap-
plication to the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board.

Unlike the Davidson Groc-
ery. whose beer and wine
permit was approved
earlier this month, the rest-
aurant specializing in pizza
would allow drinking in the
establishment with meals.

of the Davidson Grocery,
