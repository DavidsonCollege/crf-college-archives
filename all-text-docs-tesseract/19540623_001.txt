OUR FIRST L.iPRESSIONS

"Fabulous", of course , was Teensie's
famous first word about the Davidson
College boys and campus.

"Fifty to oneJ" ,.,, Jeannette is
still saying it.

Janet's first and constant expression
is "Isntt it a shame that I have to study
at a place like this{"

"But Mother, I'l] be well chaperoned",
Virginia coyly remarked,

Could it be that you all had never
seen girls before or was it just that our
table manners were a little on the rocks
that first night at dinner? But after a
few encouraging words from Bill Watt
(Gimme your meal tickets, girls), every=
thing was 0. K.

Boy was it hard that first day having
to get up in the middle of the night in
order to get to that 8 o'clock class,
because we knew that it would take us
hours to find Chambers and then that hard
task of finding our classrooms, Gallent,
McGeachy, and Mebane really have our
votes for being able to adjust to the
slight differences in their pupils so
quickly.

Next came our first seatcd chapel.
Gosh, the Davidson alphabet doesn't quite
correspond to the one we all learned at
the age of six, because the female
letters S,V,F, and H’all came at the very
end, so there we sat on the very row.
Then with the aid of our high powcred
binoculars we didn't have a bit of troublc
taking it all in, Did our ears deceive
us?-. No, -we learned to our amazement that
we were members of the Y.M.C.A. Oh, therc
is one other little detail that they
mentioned--=- we are required to conduct
ourselves as gentlemen at all times, Of
course, it was a little odd at first, but
after opening doors for the boys, light-
ing their cigarettcs, and dragging them
gently out on the dance floor, it all
They
did make one exception for us, no coats
or ties.

In all seriousness, we are really glad
to be here and "thanks" fellows for make
ing us so very welcome,
