In 1929 the T.ateiner . family
moved to Philadelphia and Jacob
entered the Curtis Institute ol
Music, where he studied until the
spring of 1947.

Wins First Place

In 1944, Jacob Lateiner won

first place in the Youth Contest

sponsored by the Philadelphia Or

chestra and as a result appeared as
guest soloist with that orchestra
in December of that year. His suc
cess was instantaneous, and from
that moment, when audience and
critics bestowed on him applause
and fpiraise usually reserved for
artists of long-established reputa
tion, Lateiner’s place in the fore-
front of contemporary pianists’ wa
assured.

On his 1945-46 concert tour that
extended from Detroit to Miami,
headlines in the local newspapers
proclaimed him a virtnosa ot the
first rank. During the war he dk
voted much of his time to playing
: camp concerts and appeared ~¢ veral
