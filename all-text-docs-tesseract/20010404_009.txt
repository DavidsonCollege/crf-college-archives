Hunt gives the
“uplifting” lyricists
high marks despite
the short album

Coldplay is latest in a string of Brit bands
to hit the shores of the US of A. The London-
based group’s debut album, Parachutes, has
taken Britain by storm, and a mini-US tour
sold out at all ten locations.

You may have heard their single Yellow on
the radio already. But here’s the real ques-
tion: is their music worth your time and
valuable money? My answer is: most defi-
nitely. This is one of the better records to
come out of England in the past two years.

The tunes are bewitchingly siniple and
beautiful. Coupled with Scotland’s Travis,
Coldplay seems to be tapping into a different
kind of Brit-pop/rock. Most of the songs. are
mellow and chill, guided by lead singer Chris
Martin’s effortless switching between his
normal range and falsetto.

The whole attitude of the album is one of
uplifting melancholy. It’s an interesting com-
bination: the music lulls you into a sense of
quiet calm while the lyrics are full of hope.
The album begins:

“And we live ina beautiful world, Yeah we
do, yeah we do, We live in a beautiful world.
Oh, all that I know, There’s nothing here to

COLDPLAY: PARACHUTES

run from, Cos yeah, everybody here’s got
somebody to lean on.” (“Don’t Panic”)

...And then the final hidden track “Life is
For Living”:

“As my head just aches, When I think of,
The things that I shouldn’t have done. But,
life is for living, We all know, And I don’t
wanna live it alone.”

Nothing earth-shattering or deeply pro-
found (at least on the surface) but when
coupled with their tinkling pianos and dreamy
guitars, you’re willing to believe them.

So is there anything wrong with Para-

chutes?,¥ es - it’s too
short. “Admittedly,
this is a personal pet
peeve, but it is espe-
cially frustrating
when given such a
promising glimpse
of musical skills.

Why do bands
and/or record labels
think that an record
is complete after 40
minutes or 10 tracks
of music? I’m not
asking for a double-
album, but it seems
artistically limiting
to operate within
these parameters.
This is only prob-
lem I have with the
record.

Otherwise, it’s a
fantastic piece of
work. Every song is
solid and well-writ-
ten. Check it out as
soon you have the
chance.

Rating: 4 turn-
tables (out of 5)

Bellacino’s . .. a spot for bellahs and boys!

By JENN BUTLER

When I was asked to review Bellacino’s for
The Davidsonian I knew it wasn’t going to be
‘a problem. I have eaten at this tasty little
pizza and grinder shop more times than I
should admit.

For those of you that have never stopped at
this cute restaurant, it is located just down the
road in Cornelius, next to the Food Lion.
Bellacino’s has a relaxed atmosphere, and is
an informal spot that offers more variety than
the typical fare of Subway or Dominoes.

My chosen poison at Bellacino’s is al-
ways one of their warm grinders. These sub
sandwiches are different then Subway be-
cause they are served warm, and the bread is
always toasty and fresh! All of my friends
have a different grinder that is their favorite,
but I’m partial to the Veggie Sub and the
Grilled Chicken sub.

For those of you who like full-fat meals,
there are sandwiches with mayo, cheese, and
the works; but for those of you who are trying
to eat right, Bellacino’s offers healthier sand-
wiches that have low-fat cheese and mayon-
naise. Other sandwiches you might want to

try at Bellacino’s are the pizza sub, the taco
sub, the BLT, and the turkey sub.

Besides hav-
ing a variety of
sandwiches
Bellacino’s
serves many
pizzas and sal-
ads. I. have
heard good
things about

the Mason Dixon line.
