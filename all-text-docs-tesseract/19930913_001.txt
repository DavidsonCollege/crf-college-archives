Consultants
to study
feasibility

of new union

By Alice Felmlee

Has the college outgrown its
current union? What sorts of fa-
cilities should be offered in a new
union? Where would such a facil-
ity be best located?

These are all questions that
representatives from MPC & As-
sociates out of Washington, D.C.

willtry toanswerthis weekasthey-~..

assess the college’s need for anew
student center. The representa-
tives will be on campus Wednes-
day through Friday for interviews
and investigation. With the help of
selected students, faculty, and staff,
they hope to draw some conclu-
sions for a new union.

During their visit to the
Davidson campus, Gail Biddison
and Tom Hier of MPC & Associ-
ates are scheduled to conduct in-
terviews with three student focus
groups, one of which is composed
solely of freshmen, members of
the SGA, and the Union Board.
The Physical Plant, the office of
Auxiliary Services, the Athletic
Department, as well as organiza-
tions not located on the Davidson
campus who enjoy the use of Union
facilities will also be interviewed.

Inaddition, Biddison and Hier
will meet with President
Kuykendall, Dean Terry, and the
Union Planning Committee com-

posed of both faculty and students.
“We have tried to assemble a :

group of students and faculty who
will represent the campus broadly
and with an open mind in these
interviews,” says Dr. John Kelton,
Director of Institutional Research
and overseer of the Union Plan-
ning Committee.

While serious discussion
about plans for a new union has
been under way for nearly a year,
original talk of such a facility be-
ganlongago. When JohnstonGym
was left vacant in 1989 by the
opening of Baker Sports Complex,
thoughts of this being the ideal
location for a new union became

apparent.

Clinton appoints Davidson dad

‘By Christy Block

As President Clinton gets com-
fortable in the Oval Office, we’ve
begun to see some changes in our
nation’s policies, and in tur, in its
leaders. We now have a whole
slew of new names in the head-
lines, one of which won’t be: too
much trouble to remember. John
Howard Dalton, Sr. is, as of July
21, the Navy’s newly appointed
Secretary.

The Junior version of our Sec-
retary of the Navy is part of the
“Davidson Family," and can’t be-
lieve people are asking him how he
feels about his father’s newest po-
sition: “It’s just strange to hear
Dad’s voice on CNN, and to think
of him as someone whose picture
will be up in the Pentagon...”

But, as unbelievable as it
seems to John, Jr., no one else
seems to be surprised that Dalton
was Clinton’s hand-picked nomi-
nee. He is said to be one of the
Navy’smost capable and qualified
secretaries.

His Senate Hearings in July
went as smoothly as they come
these days, as Mr. Dalton answered
questions about his plans for deal-
ing with Defense budget cuts, and
the latest Tailhook scandal. Dalton
faithfully stood by his Navy’s
founder, John Paul Jones, and

quoted the duties of every Naval
officer who must be both “an of-
ficer and a gentleman.”

Although Dalton became the
active Secretary in July, his swear-
ing-in ceremony took place on
August 14 at his alma mater, the
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapo-
lis, Maryland. The Naval Acad-
emy Superintendent, Rear Admi-
ral Thomas C. Lynch, made Dalton
and his entourage guests of honor

at the Acad-
emy. The “Of-
ficial Party” of
the ceremony
included the
. Deputy Secre-
tary of De-
fense, William
J. Perry, Chief
of Naval Operations, Admiral
Kelso, Marine Corps Comman-
dant, General Mundy, Admiral
Arleigh A. Burke, Rear Admiral
Thomas C. Lynch, Dean Richard
Lobs, long time friend Reverend
Doctor Robert Ratelle, Mr.
Dalton’s brother-in-law, and his
wife and “claim to fame,” Marga-
ret Ogilvie Dalton. .

Dalton’s speech raised a few
proverbial neck hairs as he accepted
his new position. He made obvi-
ous his gratitude, faith and sincere
patriotism with his closing line:

John Dalton, Sr.

“God bless you. God bless the
men and women of the Navy and
Marine Corps. And God bless
America.”
John Dalton, Sr. served 12
yearsin the Navy: four at the Acad-
emy, six in active duty where he
attained the rank of Lieutenant,
and twoin the Naval Reserve where
he was promoted to Lieutenant
Commander. After earning his
Master of Business Degree from
the Wharton School of Finance
and Commerce, Mr. and Mrs.
Dalton movedto Dallas where they
lived until 1976, when they first

moved to Washington, D.C.. Mr. °

Dalton there became active in the
Democratic Party, and was nomi-

May, Director of Development and
Alumni Programming, “We actu-
ally raised $60 million before we
ever announced we were going to
raise $150 million.”

The goals of the campaign for
Davidson are multi-faceted. The
campaignseeks $40 million tosup-
port teaching. $15 million of the
total will endow 10 Distinguished
Professorships. The McGee Pro-
fessorship in Writing is one ex-
ample. It encourages the teaching
of writing at Davidson by bringing
a different writer-teacher to

‘Davidson each year.

The campaign will raise $13
million for endowed positions, $6
million to improve salaries of the
current faculty (whichis relatively
low. in comparison with schools
like Swarthmore, Duke, Washing-
ton and Lee, and the University of
Virginia), and $6 million to allow
professors to do more research,
present more papers, exhibit more
artwork, or conduct more experi-
ments.
