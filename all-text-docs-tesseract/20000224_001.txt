Recent construction has forced many student drivers to park in the satellite lot.

By SARAH OGDEN
Editor Emeritus

Students are growing increasingly frus-
trated as the construction of a new residence
hall and student union disrupt parking pat-
terns on campus.

Some 120 on-campus parking spaces
have been lost due to the construction, said
Sam McKelvey, Director of Public Safety.

McKelvey said that 60 spaces have been
added to the satellite lot behind the Akers,
Knox, and Irwin residence halls, and 30 more
spaces have been cleared for use elsewhere
on campus in order to compensate for the lost
spaces surrounding the construction sites.

But until those who park on campus
adjust to the new distribution of spaces,
McKelvey said, growing pains are inevitable.

“The police are totally intolerant of the
fact that we have no parking,” said junior
Amanda Norrell. “All they want to do is
make money off of us.”

Contrary to popular belief, however, fines
from parking citations do not go into the
public safety budget.

Sophomore Emily Juckett shared
Norrell’s frustration. “When I get my car in
two weeks, I think I’m going to park in Baker
so I don’t have to pay $80 to register my car,”
she said. “There are no other spaces, any-
way.”

McKelvey insists that there are enough
parking spaces for all registered cars to use,
but the “biggest problem is the way people
use the spaces,” he said.

“Stagnant spaces,” created when stu-
dents park their cars in prime spaces and do

Outpost to leave
Patterson Court

The construction of the new Campus
Center will eventually remove the Union Out-
post from its current location on Patterson
Court.

The new Outpost should open as a part of
the new Campus Center next January, said
Richard Terry, Director of Auxiliary Services.

The Outpost currently presents itself as a
special eating option for students. Located on
Patterson Court among the fraternities and
eating houses, the Outpost stays open when
other campus dining facilities are closed, serv-
ing foodfrom 11 p.m. to3a.m.,every Wednes-
day through Saturday.

Sophomore Outpost worker Marty
Benson described the Outpost as “an open
territory where you can go hang out with
everyone.”

Some students fear that the relocation of
the Outpost will threaten its atmosphere, while
other students and administrators insist that

the move could bring. rowdy students to an
unspoiled campus center.

Terry acknowledged that the current
Outpost will be difficult to replace and that
some planning is needed to make a successful
transition.

“I think we’re not clear yet about what the
expectations will be for the [new] Outpost.
The atmosphere at the Outpost, particularly in
the wee hours, is really different than any
other place on campus outside of another
Patterson Court house,” said Terry. ““That’s
going to be something that we all need to talk
about before we move into a new place.”

Terry further explained that the adminis-
tration seeks input about the Outpost from
Union Board members, the SGA, students,
and faculty.

Some students, however, are not ready
for the Outpost to go anywhere. Benson began
circulating a petition to “Save the Outpost.” “I
wanted to be sure that everybody wanted to

not move them for several days or even
weeks, are a problem, he said. In addition,
McKelvey said that the 200 spaces available
next to the Baker Sports Complex regularly
sit empty.

The public safety director offered one
long-term solution to the parking crunch:
restrict freshmen to the Baker lot, which
would free about 150 student spaces for use
by upperclassmen.

McKelvey said he has discussed this
idea with the Student Government Associa-
tion. “I feel there are indications that [assign-
ing freshmen to Baker] is something to look
very closely at,” he said.

“So freshman will have to pay $80 to
park in Baker?” asked Juckett. Currently,
students without parking permits can park in
the Baker lot without being ticketed.

Sophomore Sarah Green, who parks in
Baker to avoid paying the vehicle registration
fee, said, “I don’t think relegating freshmen
to Baker would really be a solution. It will
preclude those who park in Baker for free
from parking there.”

Randy Skattum, an SGA independent
senator, said that the SGA has discussed
having freshmen park in the satellite lot be-
hind Irwin, Akers, and Knox residence halls
rather than in Baker. “That way,” said
Skattum, “no one loses free parking in Baker.”

Before definite plans are made,
McKelvey said he hoped to hear more view-
points at an open forum, which will be held
sometime this spring.
