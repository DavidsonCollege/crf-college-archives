Chambers
finally to
\start carding

By AINsLeY HINEs
Staff Writer

Chambers is going CAT-
card. Davidson’s general pur-
pose academic center will join its
science buildings and the Visual
Arts Center in requiring card ac-
cess after a certain hour.

’ The Chambers Building’s
new “safety doors” will now also
have cat card readers next tothem.
The readers have been installed at
the north and south ends, plus the
door by the elevator.

Unsure of the exact times,
Mr. Philip Cashion, director of
Operation and Management, pre-
dicts that the doors will automati-
cally lock at 6:00 pm and reopen
at 7:00 am. Half of the necessary
wiring has already been installed

weeks. Cashion foresees the sys-
tem operating by the time stu-
dents return from spring break.

The primary reason for in-
stalling them is to “make it a lot
safer for students studying at
night,” according to Cashion.
Having card accessed doors will
prevent outsiders from being able
to enter Davidson buildings after
hours.

Cashion explains that there
are often people ftom outside the
campus who mess up bulletin
boards and disturb displays. With
the card access, he hopes that “we
can prevent unwanted guests.”

Consumer Protection Committee:
Monitoring campus monopolies

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Staff Writer

Teddy Roosevelt would be
proud: two students have started the
Consumer Protection Committee to
prepare an evaluative report on all
business monopolies that operate
on the Davidson College campus.

The committee was founded
earlier this year by Lucian Dervan,
a Davidson junior and Student Govy-
ernment Association (SGA) repre-
sentative. It intends to have its re-
port ready for presentation to the
SGA by theend of the current spring

semester.

Dervan andcommittee co-chair
Toh Hean Ch’ng, a Davidson sopho-
more, have a three-fold agenda for
the Consumer Protection Commit-
tee (CPC): to investigate business
monopolies on campus, to provide
full disclosure of the findings to
students, and to recommend any
necessary courses of action to pro-
tect the interests of students in the
college’s business monopoly part-
nerships.

Most recently the structure of
the CPC has been revamped to ac-
commodate several separately func-

tioning subcommittees. Some mo-
nopolies these respective sub-
groups have targeted include BTI,
the Union Cafe and Vail Commons,
laundry services and local banks,
the college bookstore, and college
services. ;

Each subcommittee meets
weekly to discuss investigative find-
ings and formulate strategies for
ensuring the highest quality of ser-
vice from College business part-
ners. “Our main priority” says
Ch’ng , “is keeping students in-
formed about the way monopolies
do business here.”

The CPC’s subcommittees are
currently in the process of electing
head representatives. CPC co-
chairs, Dervan and Ch’ng, who
monitor each subcommittee meet-_
ing, say CPC members have thus
far shown a great deal of enthusi- :
asm and diligence in their work.

The CPC co-chairs are still ac-
tively recruiting new committee
members as well as input from stu-
dents at large.

Students who wish to join the
CPC can do so by signing the mem-
bership roll posted within the front
lobby of the Chambers building.

Campolo crusades for Christian compassion

By ANN Cup
News Editor

Tony. Campolo came to
Davidson last Tuesday and Wednes-
day plugged as an evangelist speak-
ing on homosexuality and parties.
He left as a man with a message of
healing and love.

Campolo recognized his Ital-
ian Baptist roots with humor. “The

' difference between a Baptist and a

terrorist is that you can negotiate
with a terrorist,” he says.

The. first meeting was titled
“Two Sides of a Christians View
Homosexuality.” These two Chris-
tians happened to be married.

“At the turn of the century, the
major issues facing America were
immigration and an influx of Ca-
tholicism,” said Campolo. “Now
they are abortion and homosexual-
ity. We [Campolo and his spouse]
want to demonstrate that it is pos-
sible for everyone to have a strong
difference of opinion and-not get a
divorce.”

The Campolos agreed that ho-
mosexual orientation is not chosen,
homosexual people should not have
to be in the closet to be in the Body

of Christ, and the term homosexual
lifestyle is amisnomer because there
are many homosexual lifestyles.
However, Mr. Campolo believes
that “homosexual behavior is
wrong.”

The second meeting was called

“The Kingdom of God is a Party: '

Having Priorities that Matter” Ac-
cording to Campolo, the Berlin Wall
might read: “We came, we saw, we
did a little shopping,” if it was any
reflection of the twentieth century.

“We are so efficient at produc-
ing stuff that we have to make sure
that people buy it,” said Campolo.
“How do you get people who have
all the stuff they need to buy more
stuff they don’t need?”

To convince people, advertis-
ing by companies such as Coca-

Cola has identified with the deepest ©

spiritual, psychological, and social

needs people have. Creatingafalse _

sense of fulfillment, a deadness per-
vades the world. “A can of beer
becomes fulfillment, friendship,
ecstasy,” says Campolo. “Wedon’t
have time for love, we certainly
don’t have time for God.”

One needs times of “quiet sur-
render to Jesus,” says Campolo.
“We all have a dark side, and when
Jesus connects with us out of Cal-
vary, he absorbs that dark side.
When Jesus explodes inside of you,
the kingdom of God is a party.”

Campolo believes that “when
the spirit possesses you, you will
have energy. There is a joy about
life because the deadness is gone.”

Nearing the end of his lecture,
Campolo challenged “the kids” of
the audience to work for God.
“You've got to get a feeling for the
poor and down-trodden because
that’s where Jesus is felt,” he says.

Calling for a commitment to
this work, he continues, “Let’s get
visionary, let’s do something bold.

Tony Campolo shared his vision for a path of Christian
compassion with chaplain Rob Spach.

Give me the summer at least.”

Campolo’s final message was
the example of his own faith. “I
can’t argue you into the Kingdom
of God. I can make it reasonable,
but then it’s just as reasonable to be
an atheist,” says Campolo. “All I
can do is bear witness because I
have invited Jesus to invade me,
cleanse me, and release in me the
spirit.”

Campolo created the Evangeli-
cal Association for the Promotion
of Education which contributes to
five organizations. Through these
groups, he runs several programs
including schools for children in
government housing projects in
Philadelphia and slave children in
Haiti.

“Almost from the beginning, I

was speaking on the road,” says
Campolo. “I became a pastor at 19.
Now, I do a good bit of travelling
overseas. People in other countries
still want to hear me because they
don’t know me as well.”

Because Campolo feels that he
has deep convictions and he wants
to share and is able to speak, he has
carried his message to countries like
South Africa, the Philippines, and
Germany.

“T would like students to real-
ize just how much Jesus is alive.
They can have a personal and trans-
forming relationship with Jesus
which translates into a radical
lifestyle of service to the oppressed
and poor. Being a Christian makes
you committed to social change,”
says Campolo. f
