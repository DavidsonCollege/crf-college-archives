Offensive Ad

To the Editor:

I am writing in regard to the Febru-
ary 4 issue of The Davidsonian “adver-
tisement” for the U.S. Marine Corps. I
am not writing to defend the honor of
the Corps but to express my disappoint-
ment in your journalistic integrity.
Whether or not the Marines contracted
for you to print that advertisement does
not warrant you to make a lampoon out
of it. Your actions were in very poor
taste. ;

I also want to address your decision
to paste Lieutenant Colonel Bauer’s pic-
ture in place of the pilot’s. He is ob-
viously not a recruiter for the U.S. Ma-
rines. I believe that you should formally
apologize to him in person as well as in
writing. Pictures of the faculty members
are made available for students’ use so
that they may be able to recognize unfa-
miliar ones, not as the starting material
for practical jokes. I think that before
your next printing, you need to review
your advertising contracts.

Clarification

Last week’s Marine Corps-Typesetter
parody intended no harm. The call for
typesetters was a sincere one, and Lt.
Col. Bauer’ s picture appeared in the ad
on page 9 only to draw attention to our
typesetter ad on page 13. We intended
no malice, and we hope none was
taken.—Eds.

Ugly Men
Helped Charity

To the Editor:

During the week of January 24-28
Alpha Phi Omega sponsored its annual
“Ugly Man on Campus” contest. As tra-
dition dictated, Davidson’s “ugliest”
campaigned for votes of money (l¢
equals | vote). At the end of the week,
the person with the most “votes” is
crowned “Ugly Man.on Campus” and
receives first prize: a keg of beer or the
equivalent amount of ice cream. All
proceeds from the contest will be sent to
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

This year’s winner was Dale Carter
with a tally of $77.00. “All Those Damn
SPEs” claimed second place with
$39.56. Other candidates included: Bill

_Bolding, Clark Ross, Bob Bruce, Jeff

Jordan, Nick Donovan, Lee McCor-
mick, Beth Maczka, Rus Williams, and
Robert Deaton. A special thanks goes to
these good-natured participants for
making the contest a success. A grand
total of $256.48 was collected; Alpha
Phi Omega will add to that amount,
making the total contribution $500.00.

The enthusiasm displayed by candi-
dates and volunteers was responsible for
such a fine outcome. I believe everyone
had some fun in the name of service.
Thanks again.

Phi Delt
Finances

' To the Editor:

Each year, at about this time, vi-
cious rumors begin to circulate about
the financial situation at the Phi Delt
House. Houses around Patterson Court
have found it advantageous to initiate
these murmurings, especially during the
week of self-selection. Not only are the
instigators unaware of the actual condi-
tion of the house, but they are violating
the spirit of the Honor Code at David-
son.

The truth of the matter is that the
house has undergone extensive revi-
sion. At one time, in 1980, the house
suffered from a $10,000 debt. At pres-
ent, the financial figures are back in the
black. The performance of the David-

son Chapter of Phi Delta Theta has not
gone unnoticed. The National Office of
Phi Delta Theta has nominated the chap-
ter for the 1982 Improvement Award.
There are over 140,000 members and
145 chapters nationwide. An award of
this magnitude, granted to the Davidson
Chapter and its 50 brothers cannot be
overemphasized.

We appeal to the other fraternities
around the court; allow us to compete on
equal terms. There is a new feeling of
brotherhood at the house, and denying
freshmen a chance to join a thoroughly
rededicated program would be a crime.
Let us extend our hand to them; and do
not soil the hand of friendship wiuth un-
substantiated rumor.

Special thanks to the Davidsonian
Staff for printing this story.
