Survey: Greeks Drink More

(CPS)--Residents of campus
fraternity houses drink nearly three
times as much booze as other col-
lege men, while residents of on-
campus sorority houses consume
twice as much alcohol as other
women, a recent study said.

Results of the study, con-
|ducted by the Core Institute for
Alcohol and Other Drug Studies
at Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale, were reported in the
October issue of Campus Crime.

“This is significant new in-
formation that campus officials
and prevention specialists need to
have,” Chery] Presley, director of
the institute, told the newsletter.

Overall, fraternity men aver-
age 20 drinks a week compared
with eight for other college men,
while sorority women average six
drinks a week, compared with
three fornon-sorority women. The
study was based on the responses
of 58,000 students at 78 institu-
tions of higher education from
1989 to 1991.

The study also noted that fra-
ternity members reported: being
involved in more episodes of binge
drinking (defined as having more
that five drinks at one sitting),
fights or other violent behavior at
fraternity parties, hangovers, poor
test scores, and missed classes.

Stanford OKs
Harassment Policy

After three years of debate and
rewriting, Stanford University of-
ficials enacted a new policy in
early October that deals with

STANFORD, Calif. (CPS)--'

sexual harassment on campus.

Unlike policies at some other
institutions, Stanford’s does not
prohibit consensual relationships
between students and professors,
but does warn that there are risks
involved when the relationship is
between individuals in “inherently
unequal positions.”

The policy “comes down
squarely on the side of confiden-
tially,” said University President
Gerhard Casper, regarding the
conflict between the desire “to
establish records of transgressions
that can be reviewed later” and
the assurance of confidentially that
would encourage people to come
forward.

Harassment is defined as un-
wanted sexual advances, requests
for sexual favors, and other vi-

- Sual, verbal or physical conduct.

‘Gettysburg’ to Aid College

BRUNSWICK, Maine
(CPS)--A Civil War movie star-
ring Jeff Daniels will help fund
the restoration of the Bowdoin
College home where a college
graduate and president who fought
for the Union in the Civil War
lived.

Gettysburg was screened in
Portland, Maine in early October,
and money from the premier will
go to the restoration of Joshua
Lawrence Chamberlain house.

Chamberlain, who graduated

from Bowdoin College in 1852,
took part in 24 engagements dur-

ing the Civil War and won the
Congressional Medal of Honor
for his part in the battle of
Gettysburg.

Crawl Charlotte art galleries.

By Jenny Schroeter

Those students interested in
art or wanting to gain a greater
appreciation for art were able to
participate in the gallery crawl held
last Friday. The Student Union
sponsored the event, which marked
the third one of the school year.

Students met at the Student
Union at 5:15 p.m. for a departure
to Spirits Square in Charlotte. The
actual gallery crawl was from 6-8
that night.

Students were able to see a
variety of different artistic works
featuring many artists. The new
works included “The Weight of
the World,” whichis asculpture by
Jeffrey Goll; “Rumors,” a visual
and audio exhibit; andacollection
of Bunraku puppets. Other galler-
ies that participated in the gallery
crawl included The Pope’s Galler-
ies, The Light Factory, and The
Wentworth Gallery.

The Pope’s Gallery contained
works from many local North Caro-
lina artists. There were oil paint-
ing landscapes by Kate Worm and

mixed media still life paintings by
Mary Dobbin.

The Light Factory concen-
trated on art through photography.
All of the art in the building was in
the form of photographs. Nancy
Stanfield, an employee at the gal-
lery expressed her delight in hav-
ing the gallery crawls each month.

She said that “people in the
surrounding areas are able to get a
greater appreciation of the art in
this area. They are also able to get
thechance to possibly see the works
of artists that they are not familiar
with.”

For those students who were
thinking of purchasing some art
work, The Wentworth Gallery at
Southpark Mall was open to them.
This gallery contained works from
not only local artists, but also from
some international artists.

The gallery crawl was enjoyed

-by those who were able to attend.

For those who did not have the
opportunity to go, there will be
another gallery crawl on the first
Friday of next month.

Skeleton parts discovered

Skull :ontinued from page 1

a Popper burial ground without

markers. It is likely that the bones’

were tossed aside when a new grave
was dug. Haslam does not believe
there was any “wrong doing;”
someone must have unknowingly
dug them up. The campus police
and the Davidson town police ar-
rived. on. the.scene.after. Haslam
and Vitaglione reported their find-
ings. The question came up as to
who had jurisdiction over the case.
The town police took over the in-

vestigation. The bones were sent
toalab where they will be tested to
find background information on
the age and origin of the skull and
thigh bone as well as the possible
cause of death. Results will be
back in a few weeks.

This, however, is not the first
time a human skull has been found
on campus. Years back, a few
PiKA guys found a skull some-
wherein Chambers. The skull was
given to the house and is a part of
the PiKA archives in the glass case
near the foosball table.

SGA President Alden Smith
and Honor Council chairman
Ward Davis gave an address re-
garding the Honor Code at the
faculty meeting on Tuesday, No-
vember 2. Some faculty members
expressed concern about students'
respect for the code.

The Honor Council educates
students about the code in a vari-

Faculty hears about Honor Code

ety of ways, Davis told faculty.
The Honor Council visits fresh-
man halls and gives presentations.
Davis noted that faculty can
help make students more aware of
the code by stressing it in their
classes, such as requiring students
to write out the entire Honor

pledge on all assignments.

Eventually,
Panthers
will impact
Wildcats

By Court McBryde

After a seven year battle, the
Carolinas won on October 26 when
the Richardsons announced Char-
lotte was unanimously voted to
receive an NFL franchise. This
NFL team will precipitate dramatic
effects to the Carolinas, but
Davidson will also feel an impact
from-their presence.

Member of the Panthers own-
ership group and Charlotte native,
John Harris, President of the Har-
ris Group, acommercial real estate
services firm, provided his insight
on the impact the Panthers will
have on Davidson.

Harris felt that on the surface
there should be no short term ef-
fects on Davidson due to the Pan-
thers presence.

However, “on the other side
of the coin the Panthers have the
potential to affect Davidson in the
long term view,” Harris explained.
Most importantly, “the Panthers
will serve as an economic devel-
opmental catalyst.”

The Panthers will attract
people to the area; people like to
live and visit an area of popularity:

a NBA basketball team and now a
NEL football team. In turn, “this

area of Davidson and Lake Nor-
man will grow and develop a little
more,” Harris remarked.

Davidson will encounter some

new neighbors. Harris explained
there will probably be 40-50 NFL
Panther football players who will

live in the Davidson area during

their off-season, “Lake Norman is
an attractive place to live.”

Harris continued in comment-
ing that fans will come to the Char-
lotte areato spend a weekend which
will generate as much as $30 mil-
lion of commerce to the city that
wasn’t there before.

There will be 12-14 games
linked with an estimated $42 mil-
lion in sales: restaurants, hotel
rooms, car rentals, and other huge
economic benefits to the area.
Davidson will house fans and they
will use these same facilities of-
fered in Davidson, Harris re-
marked.

From an athletic standpoint
Harris explained that the Panthers’
games will be on Sunday and there-
fore the attendance at Davidson’s

‘football games should not change.

Harris believes that the NFL
team will draw the county closer
together.

Similar to their reaction to the
NBA's Hornets, fans from the Caro-
linas will join to support another
dream team that has become a real-

ity.
