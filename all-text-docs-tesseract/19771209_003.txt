Collins Editorship will stress broader scope, greater Student voice

and international news column that
would summarize important world
affairs of the week.

“The Davidsonian cannot and

should not attempt to cover compre-
hensively national and international
news, but many Davidson students
complain that they don’t have time to
follow current events. Such a column
would be an ideal method of dealing
with that complaint.

‘‘A student who normally keeps
abreast of such issues could compile
relevent information, and it could be
handled in a manner similar to the
present ‘News at a glance’ feature,”
he continued.

Collins insists that the news does
not have to be dull and unimaginative
and he wants to instill a measure of
creativity and spontaneity in the
news section of the paper.

“By cultivating a wide range of
writing styles within the general
guidelines of The Davidsonian’s tech-
nique the news can be interesting.”’

Collins would like to see the
editorial pages also deal with a
broader range of issues.

‘Continuing the theme of world
affairs, a student interested in a
particular issue could write a compre-
hensive analysis of a situation and
inject his own opinions and interpre-
tations of the problem.

“T realize this has been attempted
in the past, but not on a continuing
and current basis.

“The recent article by Youssef
Abagui giving an international stu-
dent’s interpretation of a situation
involving his native country is an
excellent example of this idea.

- “Now the possibilities of similar
situations with other students should
be explored,’’ Collins said.

In the area of sports, Collins calls
for ‘‘more interpretative articles and
less of a rehash of last week's game.”

He indicated that sports should
not necessarily be limited to the back
pages of the paper.

“I would like to see us run some
sports stories on page one. If a
Davidson team does well in a sport
let’s put it up front.” ,

He added that this concept is not
limited to major sports either. He
wants to see comprehensive reporting
of so-called minor sports and not to

~~ ——relegate them to smatit articles dealing

with a particular event.

‘For The Davidsonain’s weekly
format it is impossible to cover last
week’s game like it happened yester-
day.

“The trend that has already begun
toward sports columns should be
emphasized,"’ he said.

He would like to see a series of
in-depth studies of all teams compet-
ing in the Southern-Gonference for a
given sport, for example. This series

ment opportunities.

“The resturant guide was a good
beginning, but what about Charlotte
theatre? There could also be article
about Charlotte speciality shops that
could eventually generate advertising
possibilities for the paper,‘‘ he contin-
ued.

He praised the features trend
toward highlighting unusual person-
alities.

‘People are interesting -only if we
bother to find them. The Davidson-
ian’s function should be to introduce
students to these interesting people
who are usually interested in them.”

Collins believes that an important
key to all these plans is coordination.

on their hands; freshmen, sopho-
mores, and juniors who recognize the
wisdom of complementing academics
with active participation in extra-
curricular activities.

Proadening the Perspective

e‘‘T intend to set up lines of
communication with other college and
university newspapers (UNC, UVA,
Wake, Duke, Rice, Williams, Haver-
ford, to name a few). My plan is to
exchange newspapers and ideas with
these schools with an eye towards
improving the quality of The David-
sonian.”’

_ Duncan is also considering affilia-
ting The Davidsonian with the Asso-
ciated College Press, the Collegiate
Press Service, or another of the
national organizations that serve
college newspapers.

“Such affiliation would bring The
Davidsonian out of its little corner of
the world and into the national
mainstream. The staff would then be
able to view Davidson events in their
proper perspective, shunning irre-
sponsible overreaction.’

*If elected, Duncan plans to invite
professional journalists to the campus
regularly to critique The Davidsonian
and discuss career possibilities in
journalism.

“Face-to-face evaluation by these
professional visitors wil] encourage
excellence. The professionals know
good journalistic writing when they
see it—they can teach the staff how to
compose precise, clear, organized

eT will reintroduce The Davidson-
ian into national competition with
other newspapers. For more than two
decades the Associated Press rated
The Davidsonian an “All-American”
newspaper (the highest distinction).
In recent years, we have not submit-
ted The Davidsonian to analysis by
such organizations.

Organization and Improvement

Duncan is armed with many other
ideas—reorganizing staff operations

would-involve not only articles about——to promote efficiencey; improving the

Davidson but also about our oppo-
nents. These columns would not just
include basketball, but tennis, soccer,
swimming, whatever the sport.

Collins would like to revive the
sports feature ‘‘athlete of the week”’ in
order to recoghize and to. commend
outstanding athletes.

He would encourage editorial opin-
ion and columns covering sports on

«he editorial pages as well.
“Collins feels that the features area

of the paper could also benefit from a
broader scope. |

“The features articles too often
only deal with Davidson events. But
the city of Charlotte is only thirty

cals .minvtes. away and often offers David-

#* son students: raany eixuitiing ‘entertain -

newspaper’s appearance, developing a
polling procedure to gauge student
opinion, regularizing distribution and
expanding circulation.

We must restructure office and
print shop organization so we can
eliminate time wasted and undertake
the programs I propose,’ he explains.

‘The appearance of the newspaper
should be professionalized. I will
concentrate particularily eliminating
spelling errors and using more inte-
resting photographs and graphics.

eDuncan is aiso interestea in
discovering the students’ attitudes on
a number of subjects, and will test the
feasibility of two polling procedures.

First, we could poll by. telephone-
calling ‘Tandouuty- serected numbers;

“The Davidsonian should coordi-
nate its efforts more closely with all
campus organizations, Union Board,
SGA, and particularly with WDAV.

““With the expansion of the radio
station into such areas as campus and
local news this ‘coordination between
media could be invaluable,'’ he ex-
plained.

The particular tool needed to impli-

. ment these plans, Collins indicated, is

people.

“The Davidsonian is the College's
newspaper. Its staff should be limit-
less. For the paper to expand its scope
it must expand its staff.

‘‘The paper includes everyone,

the second alternative is to insert
printed polls into copies of the
newspaper, welcoming response from
any of our readers,’ Duncan says.

«Barring mechanical failures, we
will deliver The Davidsonian to the
doorstep of every on-campus student
on Thursday night. I plan to elimi-
nate the human errors that delayed
distribution until Friday on several
occasions earlier this year.

Section-by-section Plans

In a section-by-section rundown,
Duncan presents more of his ideas for
the newspaper and reveals personal
attitudes that would influence his
approach to the editorship.

NEWS

“My years of Davidsonian news-
work have taught me that the
newspaper only rarely has an oppor-
tunity to break a ‘‘hard’’ news item,
to tell the entire campus somet’ ng
completely new. -

“Since many students have a basic
knowledge of what happens at David-
son, it is the newspaper's responsibil-
ity to go beyond the mere repetition
of facts.

“The Davidsonian must research
and interview thoroughly; covering
all sides of an issue, devoting particu-
lar attention to the impact and
long-term significance of news events.
News articles must present informa-
tion in an unbiased manner, allowing
the reader to reach his own conclu-
sions.

“T will carefully choose the topics
for my personal editorials, weeding
out the trivial and shunning overreac-
tion. When pointing out Davidson's
flaws, I will offer constructive sug-
gestions to correct those flaws, for I
believe that criticism is useless unless
it is paived with a presentation of
realistic alternatives.

“My editorials will focus primarily
on correcting problems at Davidson,
but I will be quick to praise and
encourage those individfals-or groups
who make a significant positive
contribution to life at the College.”

“*T will urge students and faculty to
submit opinion columns and Letters
to the Editor, and will especially
invite criticism from those who be-
lieve that the newspaper is in any way
neglecting its responsioilities to Da-
vidson College. Our readers must help
us point out our flaws so we can work
to correct them.” —

FOCUS ——

“I see FOCUS as a news-editorial
hybrid, a blending of straight news
with news analysis and opinion.

| FOCUS should ask probing questions
about important issues of campus-
wide interest; it should challenge the
reader to siu5vand-to form an

|

I want to emphasize my desire to
insure that the paper involves every-
one it possibly can. Every student
can and should have a voice in The
Davidsonian.”

Collins feels that his experience on
the paper will serve him well in the
position of Editor.. He has served on

the paper Since his first weeks at

Davidson.

He has served as a news staff writer
and later advanced to the position of
Assistant News Editor. He has had
experience in the sports section as an
action sports editor.

He currently serves as News Edi-
tor.

opinion.”
FEATURES 7

‘‘Peopled with a larger staff of
creative and innovative writers, the
Features section presents The David-
sonian with its best opportunity to
‘explore new frontiers,’’ indicates
« Duncan.

“Film, book, record, and restaur-
ant reviews, articles on interesting
personalities in the community, pre-
views of upcoming cultural events
and entertainment in Davidson and
the area, the Inside Art section—
these and many other possibilities
should guarantee that Features is one
of the most interesting parts of The
Davidsonian.”

SPORTS

“A number of students turn first
to the sports section, then read their
way back through the rest of the
newspaper. I recognize the high level
of interest in athletics at Davidson
and as Editor will:

—improve coverage of Davidson's
major sports by a) deemphasizing
‘dead’ rehashes of week-old events
and stressing informational previews
of upcoming contests, and b) inclu-
ding special features on the coaches
and athletes of the major sports.

—expand coverage of minor sports
and club sports, where many devoted
student-athletes too often labor in
obscurity.

—continue the famous IMAC
weekly recap, probably one of the
most-read features in the newspaper.

Credibility

Duncan emphasizes that ‘‘the Edi-
tor must never lose sight of the fact
that his most important responsibil-
ity is to establish The Davidsonian’s
credibility, to foster respect for The
Davidsonian as a legitimate journal-
istic institution, not ‘‘the students’
rag,’’ as its detractors label it.

“Students pay for The Davidson-

ian, and they have it thrust upon

them every week. They have a right
to expect that the information in the
newspaper is correct.

“Give me the opportunity to serve
as Editor and my staff and I will work
