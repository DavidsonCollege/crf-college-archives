THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Search For A Silver Lining

Dr. Clem Rininger advised us in
vespers Sunday night to look always
for the silver lining. President Martin
is trying to find one this week (see
story on page one). So are we, but with
less success.

News from the Board of World
Missions Tuesday came as a disheart-
ening blow. Davidson will have no
Congolese students next year. Maybe
in 1962 is the word now.

Thus ends temporarily a challeng-
ing chapter in Davidson history which
began last February with a short an-
nouncement. by the trustees. Their
surprise statement, in welcome re-
sponse to a request by the Board itself,
set off a three-month chain of events
which promised a real breakthrough
in Davidson's provincial, conservative
shell.

Since then, the administration and
college family have done a most com-
mendable job in preparing for one or
more Congolese students next fall.
The only condition seemed to be that
the college feel it was ready. It is—
and that is what makes it so hard to
accept the Board's failure to assign
us one of its ten available Congolese
students. The breakthrough came
from their request; now, by their ac-
tion, the program is set back a year.

Until this week, it appeared we
would have at least two Congolese.
The Congolese Committee was to hold
its final meeting of the year next
Wednesday and wrap up its extensive
and tireless consideration of possible

problems. Monday, Jean Calvin May-
imbu won the hearts of the college, as
did Mrs. David Miller last week, in
presenting the case for the Congolese.
Their advice and appeals were well
received.

Student volunteers had made ar-
rangements to room with the Congo-
lese. Mrs. Moore was most pleased
with student reaction, and experienced
no problems in settling the boys in
Duke and Richardson dorms. Talks
with the Congo over the ROTC Depart-
ment’s radio furnished no good reason
for discouragement. Everything was
going smoothly. If there is a silver
lining, perhaps this is it. But, then the
bottom fell out.

After talking with President Martin,
we feel assured that there will be no
letup on the college’s part. The Congo-
lesé¢ Committee will continue to func-
tion, and Davidson will continue look-
ing toward the day the color barrier
will be broken officially—-on more
than just the trustees’ minutes.

The trustees will be meeting again
in two weeks. There COULD BE a sil-
ver lining in the possible actions they
could take. Davidson is now prepared
for Negro students. Two places are
reserved in the incoming ‘Freshman
Class. They might still be filled. if the
trustees would alter their statement
either to admit students, recommend-

ed by the Board, from other African °

countries, or find qualified students
outside the province of the Board.
It could still be done.

It's That Time Again...

It all started that night a couple
of weeks ago when upperclassmen
were disturbed in their sleep by a dis-
turbing dampness—the freshmen had
decided to have a riot, and Belk was a
likely target. It seemed a little late
for this kind of thing, but maybe the
freshmen deserved it. They never did
get off a good one last fall.

Then it was the Chambermaidens.
They still look like they had a hard
night of it last week — somebody
splashed yellow and green paint all
over their lovely forms. Must be some
significance somewhere .. .

Another rash of car moving has also
plagued several members of the col-
lege family — a blue Volkswagen
looked awfully lost down behind the
Kappa Sig house for a couple of days.

We understand that David Dakin’s
problems have attracted much atten-
tion all through the South. A Texas
newspaper wants to syndicate the sto-
ry, and college papers across the state
have been calling THE DAVIDSON-
IAN. (See story on this page.)

But last Monday night was the cli-
max. Davidson’s First Annual May
Hole Dance was undoubtedly the
greatest impromptu display since the
chief brought in the flaming plum-pud-
ding at the North Mecklenburg Volun-
teer Fire Department's covered dish
supper in Chambers dining hall.

Receiving inspiration from the cal-
endar and perhaps an invitation to
some celebration this weekend, ingen-
ious Davidson students welcomed
spring in their own rite.

The situation was perfect: the col-
lege provided the hole (soon to contain
a flagpole) between Belk and Cham-
bers. The rain miraculously stopped
about 10 minutes before the party
started. The faithful began gathering,
and after a few moments of indecision,
the celebration began, though not as
elaborately as expected. The rain had
soaked the crepe paper streamers
coming out of the hole. The four-
piece band failed to show up. But no-
body missed them. The limbo dancing,
originated in the torrid tropics by hot
natives, took place by flickering torch
light. Well after midnight the celebra-
tion broke up, and weary students
finally gave in.

Yes, it’s spring, and exams are com-
ing. And Davidson Men are tensed
and waiting. To take a little poetic
license with William Carlos Williams:

Calendar Killed Freshman Camp

September 1-4 Friday through Mon-
day. YMCA Freshman Camp.

The above item, listed as the first
event on the newly published school
calendar for next year, is a sarcastic
epitaph to the death of the Freshman
Camp. And the Scheduling Committee
is the culprit, directly or indirectly.

The Y never had any interrfion of
holding a freshman camp on those
dates. They span Labor Day weekend,
when neither a majority of proposed
campers or counselors would be
through summer jobs and able to at-
tend. A camp site, within reasonable
price, would be well nigh impossible.
To be blunt, the camp would be
doomed from the start.

Actually, the Y placed a request
before the Faculty Committee on
Scheduling when it began working
on next year’s calendar. On the basis
of a highly successful program in its
debut last fall, the Y had a good claim
on three “suitable” days before orien-
tation.

This claim was by-passed in the com-
mittee’s first draft. The Y approached

the administration and again placed
a special request to salvage the camp,
which was given the full support of
the college the previous year. Again
the‘ plea was overlooked in essence
as the Y was graciously given Labor
Day weekend.

We dare say the Freshman Camp of
two days and shorter would be more
beneficial than the present over ex-
tended “freshman indoctrination,”
but that is not the present issue.

Next year’s calendar convinces us
that some student opinion should be
solicited by the committee, or prefera-
bly, that it should have a student
member. Perhaps the Freshman Camp
issue could have been more suitably
resolved. The ridiculous mid-term
mid-week break might have been
avioded. Such oversights as last year’s
return from holidays on January 1
might never occur.

There are many aspects to planning
a calendar, and a student member
would not solve every problem. But
the move should go a long way toward
a more realistic schedule.

Calhoun Admits Faults,
States Goals Of Honors

By DR. R. J. CALHOUN
Assistant Prof. of English

I have agreed to make a
brief statement about English
Honors only if I might make
it clear, first, that I have had
less experience with the pro
gram than other professors
in the English Department
and, second, that I have no
desire to escape any of the
blame that may be mine for
whatever is wrong with the
program.

The most general aim of
an Honors Program. was stat-
ed concisely by President
Frank Aydelotte, when he
initiated the famous Swarth-
more program in 1922: “to
free from the limitations of
classroom routine those stu-

dents whose maturity, inter-
est, and capacity suit them
for independent work.”

What Mr. Epes has de-
scribed is a situation in which
the Honors student is freed
from the classroom routine
to one just as dull and much
more limited in scope than
class work because of undue
concentration on reports and
a term paper.

BROAD CONTENT

No student's capacity for
independent work is tested
by a series of reports on one
term paper topic.

Consequently, the coritent
of the subject matter must
be broad, and reports should
demand of the student a wid-
er range of reading and in-

ROTC FIELD DAY

Army Stalwarts

Display

By RICK von UNWERTH
Davidsonian Feature Editor

The stirring strains of “In-
vercargill” blared across the
field, and Richardson Stad-
ium reeked with esprit de
corps. Davidson ROTC was
having a field day.

The U. S. Army's future
stalwarts displayed their
prowess in the arts of war;
demonstrated to their dedi-
cated cadre that the intensive
military training had not
come to nought. Amid the en-
thusiastic cheers of their
drillmates, a chosen few pre-
pared to mount their staunch
and hardy teammates for a
grueling four-lap piggy-back
relay. Standing on the steps
of the west stands, Captain
Pierce smiled down on his
boys.

On the other side of the
parade ground, the princi-
ple of the shot-put was
utilized in a beautifully
practical exercise — the
hand grenade throw. With
a three-hop wind-up, the
apprentice soldiers launch-
ed such prodigious heaves
as would do any frontline
shavetail proud.

Excitement ran at a fever

pitch, and the enthusiastic
roar from the eager grand-
Stand was so impressive that

even the sunbathers on the
roof of Duke Dormitory
stood up to look.

On the fifty yard line, op-

four of the troops, urged on

lt was a great day for
the Army.

Squad after squad assumed
the field and paced them-
selves through intricate man-
euvers, demonstrating to the
proud staff the utmost in mil-
itary discipline. An equally
exciting, though not nearly as
practical, volley ball game
kept the hoarse companies
on their collective feet. With
indomitable spirit and fight-
ing hearts, Tug-of-War teams
lunged back. and forth, to and
fro, up and down the grid-
iron in heated battle. It was
a fitting climax to a refresh-
ingly different, albeit ex-
hausting, drill period.

ROTC has done it again.

UNDERSTANDING ?

vestigation than he has ever
done before. Highly special-
ized and narrow, scholarly
topics for reports should be
avoided like the plague.

It is my persona] belief
that no Honors Program can
succeed so long as_ what
should be its primary goal is
not met — a goal best de-
scribed in terms of the defini-
tion made by Eton’s famous
Headmaster, William John-
son Cory, of a good education
as ‘acquiring more than just
knowledge . . . learning to
take mental notes under cri-
ticism.”

CRITICISM

The thinking of the stu-
dent in his reports and in his
discussions should be under
the continual scrutiny and
criticism of his classmates
and instructors. Before this
aim can be accomplished at
Davidson, however, both stu-
dents and instructors will
have to regard criticism
as neither an affront to pride
nor an unchristian act.

The instructor has the re-

sponsibility of setting up
problems which give his stu-
dents opportunities to utilize
their wide reading in an at-
mosphere charged with cri-
tical intelligence.

(ILLUSTRATION

For one illustration of how
this might be encouraged in
a Modern Poetry Honors
session, after wide reading in
Wallace Stevens and William
Carlos Williams, the instruc-
tor might set up as a problem
a detailed comparison and
contrast between Williams’
poem, “El Hombre,” and Ste-
vens, “Nuances,” which is
Williams’ poem rewritten in
Stevens’ own style.

As to the responsibilities
of the student, let me quote
one sentence from the de-
scription of the Swarthmore
program: “Each student has
an equal responsibiliy for the
assimilation of the whole of
material and is correspond-
ingly searching in his scruti-
ny of ideas presented by his
fellows or by his instructor.”

No instructor and no stu-
dent who cannot either give
or take criticism should par-
ticipate in the program. In
short, the essence of an Hon-
ors Program must be a coop-
erative search for truth by
both students and professors
if it is to have any validity at
all.

HONORS THESIS

In all fairness to the Cur-
riculum Committee, I should
mention that a possible re-
vision of the Honors Program
has been under investigation.
The possible additions of an
honors thesis and outside ex-
aminers have been suggested.

I would favor outside ex-
aminers, for I think the know-
ledge that what is accom-
plished in an English Honors
Program would be examined
by men ‘of the caliber of
Cleanth Brooks, Harry Levin,
or Lionel Trilling (to mention
a few possibilities) would
highly motivate both student
and instructor to work more
conscientiously.

“Among Christians,
I Am Always Accepted’’

By ERVIN DUGGAN

It is a new thing for us to be prayed for in chapel
by a little black man from the Congo.

But Jean Calvin Mayimbu, laboring under the happy
delusion that he was in church, did that Monday and
the hall was a little bit quieter than it generally is
when we are prayed over by professors and fat divines
from the suburbs.

Mayimbu made an undistinguished chapel talk.
He was handicapped by an unfamiliar language
and by the strange misapprehension that he some-
how owed us his gratitude.

He made a talk that many considered too personal
to be informative, and he answered few of the ques-
tions which were puzzling students about the possibil-
ity of having students from the Congo here in Sep-
tember.

It was only afterward, in informal discussions and
classes, that we could see the depth and bigness of
the man.

Why had he skirted the sensitive issues in his talk?

“I did not come to America to judge this coun-
try or the church,” he said. “I came here to learn,
and | will go back to Congo to help my people.
Segregation is not my problem—it is yours. | am
no politician.”

That didn’t seem much of an answer. We pressed
further, and soon the answer became clear:

For Mayimbu, who comes from a country where
tribal warfare, not segregation, is the accepted form
of human stupidity, segregation in America is at best
a piffling problem. °

His own church, he said, has defended Christ-
ians of rival tribes against robbery and death.
(Needless to say, this doesn’t prevail in the Amer-
ican church, where the man who sits by you on
Sunday may be the one who robs you on Monday.)

Thus his anger was short-lived (though genuine)
when he received a letter from a Presbyterian Church
in eastern North Carolina: “We are having an inter-
national students’ Sunday,” it said. “We of course
cannot invite you to be with us, since you are colored,
but couldn't you send us a letter telling about your-
self?”

We asked Jean Calvin what he thought of that at-.
titude in the church.

He shrugged.

“It’s nothing. Just Satan at work, misleading them...
I have been many places where I was not accepted, but
Christ is not there.

“| prefer to be among Christians, for among
Christians 1 am always accepted as a brother, just
as you are accepting me as a brother.”

A crude over-simplification? Naive? Childish and
fundamentalistic?

Yes. But he believes it deeply, and a host of church-
men share his belief in one form or another.

Jean Calvin Mayimbu, with his luminous faith
and his simple answers, embarrassed us. He
chastened us with his reluctance to judge, made
us sorry we'd pressed so far.

But talking to him was rewarding.

Apparently we won‘t have Congolese students here
next year after all. But the question will come up again,
and the visit of Mayimbu has provided part of the
answer:

If those who come here are anything like Jean Calvin

Mayimbu, we can look upon their presence not as a

problem but as an opportunity.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dakin’s Belated Jockey
Causes Grave Concern

EDITOR’S NOTE: The following letter has been
sent to approximately 30 different colleges in-
cluding Duke, UNC, Agnes Scott, St. Mary’s, The
Citadel, Queens, Georgia Tech, Princeton, Ohio
State, and Colorado School of Mines. It was print-
ed in part in the Charlotte News, and the Houston
Chronicle asked Dakin‘s permission to syndicate

Athletic Supporters:

A grave situation has arisen at Davidson College in
North Carolina which calls for the united support of
neighboring Southern colleges and sympathetic stu-
dents in other areas of our great nation. Not since the
Japanese Student Riots of the summer of 1960 has
such an appealing cause arisen on a college campus.

The Davidson College Executive Committee has
found it necessary to restrict Mr. David N. Dakin, a
talented young soccer player, to this campus for a two-
week-period for his irresponsible failure last November
to return an athletic supporter belonging to the Col-
ege.

The delay in the Committee’s action has been attribu-
ted to the lengthy deliberation required for so serious
and costly a matter.

Immediate action has been taken by the class of ’62,
and the “David Dakin Jockey Fund” was founded at
Davidson on April 27, 1961, to defray the losses sus-
tained by the College at the end of each soccer season
when players fail to return their supporters.

We are now conducting our first annual Spring
Fund-Raising Drive and earnestly enlist the support
of students at our sister institutions.

Letters of sympathetic encouragement should be
sent to the editor of The Davidsonian, Davidson, N. C.
However, our major request is for equipment to refill
our diminishing supply. Pertinent material contribu-
tions (preferably used) should be sent directly to the
Executive Committee, Davidson College, Davidson,
