Lecturer talks -Senior
on African- studio art

Americans in
Modern Art

By Jonathan Brooks

Winslow Homer is frequently
associated with the paintings of an
idealistic, nineteenth-century
America, seascapes, and carefree
childhood experiences. Duke Uni-
versity history professor Peter
Wood brought light to another sub-
ject which Homer chose to depict:
African-Americans after the eman-
cipation of slavery in 1863. Wood,

the Ken Kelley lecturer for this .

semester, proceeded to give an in-
formative talk on the impact of the
emancipation on African-Ameri-
cans as portrayed in art.
Professor Wood began the lec-
ture with a discussion of Homer’s
1899 painting The Gulf Stream, in
which an African-American is seen
drifting on a boat surrounded by
sharks in the ocean, Wood ex-
pressed that in orderto fully under-

stand Homer’s treatment of the §f,

CAKE iNTAKE!

African-American in this work, it
is necessary to follow the develop-
ment of Homer’s portrayal of
- blacks in his other paintings.

Homer, who was also an illus-
trator for Harper’s Weekly, por-
trayed the situation of blacks dur-
ing and after the Civil War in his
illustrations for this publication and

in his paintings. In his painting of .

adecaying Mt. Vernon (which was
often seen as an emblem of the
nation), Homer presented an alle-
gorical painting, according to
Wood, as evidenced by Homer’s
depiction of an African-American
family, emerging from the base-
ment into the bright daylight, with
their backs to the south, facing
north toward their freedom.

Professor Wood also noted
that while many of Homer’s con-
temporaries portrayed African-
Americans disparagingly, Homer
courageously faced the problems
of blacks in his paintings. Many.
painters continued to glorify south-
ern traditions and portrayed blacks
in complete subservience. Wood
said that Homer, on the other hand,
chose to confront issues that arose
for the freed blacks after the Civil
War. For example, education, la-
bor, and political relations were
some of the important themes ad-
dressed by the artist in his works.

Attheend of the lecture, Wood
returned to the painting of The
Gulf Stream and stated that “Homer
had come to that painting with a
lifetime of experience.” Homer
witnessed the Civil War, the eman-
cipation of slaves, and the Recon-
struction era, and he brought all of
these experiences to light in his
painting.

With this in mind, this par-
ticular painting illustrated the con-
dition of all African-Americans in
1899. After witnessing the Recon-
struction and the implementation
of segregative laws, Homer in this
painting alluded to the desperate
situation of blacks at the turn of the
century.

Like the figure in the artist’s
painting, African-Americans were
free to explore the open sea but
were met by hostile sharks.
