Cavatelli Casserole combines
the cheap pasta meal with the col-
lege staple food, pizza. Itis simple
to prepare and will provide more
than enough food for four or five
people. Be sure not throw out your
leftovers because this casserole

tastes just as good when reheated

in the microwave. For this recipe,
you will need the following ingre-

. dients:

1 Ib. box Cavatelli
noodles

1'? Ibs. ground beef

1/2-3/4 lb. shredded moz-
zarella

1/2-3/4 Ib. shredded pro-

volone

1/4-1/2 Ib. sliced pep-

peroni
1 medium onion, sliced
1 48 oz. jar spaghetti
sauce
1/2 tbsp each salt and

pepper
1 tbsp oregano

Place Cavatelli in pot of boil-
ing water and cook like you would
any other type of pasta. While the
noodles are cooking, brown ham-
burger and sliced onion in a frying
pan on med-high heat. When the
hamburger is done, drain excess
fat from pan. Combine noodles,
hamburger, salt, pepper, and
oregano to taste. A casserole pan
would be best to use, but any type
of deep dish will do. Next, add
pepperoni, sauce and mozzarella
and mix thoroughly. Sprinkle pro-
volone cheese on top of the casse-
role. Bake for 30 minutes at 329°,

or until provolone cheese turns a.

golden brown. Garlic bread and a
tossed salad will,complement this
well-balanced meal.

With all of the money you are
saving on this cheap meal we rec-
ommend you splurge and buy a
nice bottle of white wine (not

 Boone’s) or some imported beer; it

will make the evening that much
better. We hope you enjoy the
casserole. . . until we cook again.

bands
worth

right
pinky

Swervedriver very well could
be the greatest band in this galaxy
without a U.S. label. Such a trav-
esty recently forced me to shell out
afew extra bucks for the import EP
Last Day On Earth in the hopes
that I might relive the joy I found in
the majestic sounds of ‘93sMezcal
Head as well as ‘91s Raise. At
first listen, the scaled down sound
of the songs might surprise
Swervedriver fans. After all, this
is the band whose guitar-drenched,
pedal-crazy tunes would make
Billy Corgan jealous. Even with-
out the walls upon walls of swirl-
ing sound, Swervedriver maintains
aspectacular dynamism. I quickly
found myself replaying the four
tracks over and over again. The
last track, “The Director’s Cut Of
Your Life”, builds up froma steady
melancholy to a fevered pace cli-
maxed in an intense solo so grati-
fying I liken it to a religious purg-
ing, the effects pedal bursting forth
at the perfect moment. And the
title cut is a sleek, sublime ballad
sure to suck you in. Their most
recent LP stands nearly atop the
UK-Indie charts and yet Ejector
Seat Reservation may never see -
the light of day here in the states. I
certainly have no qualms about the
extra dough I'spent for the EP, and
I’ll gladly give my right pinky (or
at least $20) for a copy of their
latest album.

’ Earth Eighteen is another band
most have never heard of, but
whose music transcendently as-
tounds. This chic glam-rock outfit
creates wonderful guitar — driven
pop alongside extensive use of the
synthesizer in their debut entitled
Butterfly. Here, the synthesizer
serves to accentuate and bolster
the sound rather than detract and
distract as most bands tend to do
with the instrument nowadays. No
happy-go-lucky synthesizer a la
ELO, Supertramp or Jellyfish will
be found here; instead an

. otherworldly, atmospheric effect
_ is produced by the keyboard work

of Jon Dupree, who also sings and
provides plenty of hook-heavy
guitar work.. Also absent from
Butterfly are the sugar plum fairy
lyrics most modern pop musicians
feel obliged to use to coincide with

_ their joyous melodies and happy

harmonies. While retaining out-
standing melodies and with an un-
canny pop sensibility, Earth Eigh-
teenisa bright, ethereal otherworld
you ought to visit, far removed

‘from the dreary muck of the con-

temporary pop music world. I'd
give my right pinky for them, too.
