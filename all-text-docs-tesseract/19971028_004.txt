te. THE DAVIDSONIAN

NEws

Mary Lee of the Davidsonian recently
spoke with officer Stan Moore of
Davidson’s Campus Safety and Police
Office about his job as a police officer
at Davidson.

The Davidsonian: How long have
you worked at Davidson and what did
you do before?

Officer Moore: I have worked at
Davidson for close to
six years. Before, I was
a military policeman,
stationed at Fort Bragg
and twice in Germany.
Then Davidson gave me
an offer in the civilian
police force, and I came
here.

D: What differences
have you seen in terms
of crime levels during
your six years here?

M: Crime has definitely

gone down because of our incorpora-
tion of cars, rather than cushmans, and
our great personnel. Also, the envi-
ronment is very good. The students
and faculty have been.more observant
and will call us with any suspicious
activity.

D: What is the part you love most
about your job?

M: The environment is good. I like
working with different people. _

D: What is the thing you like least
about your job?

M: Probably the misconceptions. A
lot of people think we are security
guards. In actuality, we are sworn
policemen.

D: What does Davidson's crime
scene primarily consist of?

M: Our biggest problem is bicycle
thefts. Sometimes they are just “ride-

offs” (when students mistake another
student’s bike for their own) that turn
up later. But students should make a
conscious effort to lock their bikes.
Other problems are larceny, damage to
property, and vandalism. But we can
never know if they are internal or exter-
nal problems.

D: Do you enjoy the college campus
environment? :

M: I runa few miles with the candi-
dates inthe morning. Then lift weights
at Baker or the local YMCA in the
afternoon. If I have any clients for
personal training, I also work out with
them.

D: What do you think of your nick-
name of “Hightower?”

M: I’ve gotten used to it. Some people
think it is my real name. They call me
Officer Hightower.

Some of the other offic-
ers don’t like it, because
they think we should be
called by our official
names. But I’ve gotten
used to it.

D: Did you ever play
basketball?

M: Yes, I played in
high school and for a

M: It took some adjusting from mili-

‘tary police to campus police work, but

I see myself staying here for now.

D: What does a typical day on-duty
look like?

M: I come in and make sure the build-
ings are secure. Then I take care of any
needed escorts. Each shift, there is at
least one fire or burglar alarm, usually
false. Seventyfive percent of the time,
I am in the car, but we are trying to get
out more on foot. This summer we
started a bike patrol.

D: What are your hobbies or interests?

M: My primary interest is physical
fitness. I am a personal trainer and
work with candidates at the Sheriff's
Academy of Mecklenburg County and
CPCC to get them physically fit.

D: What does a typical day’s work-out
consist of?

semi-professional team
in the Army.

D: Do you have any advice to stu-
dents?

M: Make sure to lock your bikes up
and report any suspicious activities.
Contact the police right away. Make
us aware,so we can check it out imme-
diately. Also, single females should
be careful about walking around alone
at night. It always makes me nervous
to see that.

I'd like to see more people get
involved inthe RAD (Rape, Aggresion,
Defense) program that we sponsor.
We teach courses in basic self-defense
to women.

The biggest problem is getting
the word out to students.

D: Anything else you want Davidson J}.

students to know about you?

M: People think I-am the big ticket
writer. I just wanted. to clear up that
misconception and say that we write
equally around here.

Commons to refund one

of two deducted meals

SGA to conclude investigation
at tonight’s meeting

By Jessica GoopsoN

News Editor

One of two meals deducted from
the plans of Vail Commons patrons
during the inaugural festivities will be
refunded. The SAC to Auxilary Ser-
vices chair Foster Haselden, in con-
junction with Dining Services staff,
will determine which week the meal
will be added.

The SAC investigated the method

of payment for the two inaugural meals -

in response to the resolution presented
by senior class president Tim Saintsing
October 14. A printed summary of the
investigation will be submitted to the
SGA meeting tonight at 9:00 p.m.

The resolution charged the coun-
cil to not only-investigate why none of
the Patterson Court houses helped fund
the meals, but whether plan-holders
would be refunded for the two meals.

Vail Commons Manager Barbara
Metzler said that, of the two meals
deducted, the value of one was used to
finance the pre-inaugural dinner Octo-
ber 2. The other meal’s'value was held
in a fund for the Inaugural Committee.
But according to Committee chair
Leland Park, funding from Vail Com-
mons was not utilized. The Commit-
tee—not the Commons—paid for the
catered luncheon on Friday October 3.
This meal was ostensibly free for ev-
eryone in attendance.

Metzler agreed that if the money
which was set aside was not used by the

Committee then it could be refunded to
plan-holders.

Many plan-holders—mainly fresh-
man and independents—did not notice
the reduction in meals for the week, or
were aware of it and simply adjusted.
But because the pre-inaugural dinner
was soley paid for by the Dining Ser-
vices, some plan-holders are still per-
turbed over the loss of both meals. They
had no vaice in deciding where their
money was allocated:

In the future she said she plans to
communicate better beforehand to avoid
miscommunication over meals. “The
intent was simply for the dinner to be a
great affair for the President presented
by the students,” said Metzler.

Park reminded students that no
plan-holder, upon realization that they
had two less meals than expected, was
denied access to the Commons. In,prac-
tice every student that anticipated two
free meals got just that. Metzler said
that only 17 students expressed displea-
sure about the missing meals. “We got
the most complaints at Saturday lunch,”
she said. “Eight people were waived
through as guests on the counter pass.
One student received.a cash refund. No
one was turned away. ”

“We want students to have a good
experience with their Dining Service,”
said Metzler. “Sometimes we even add
meals at a loss to Vail Commons, espe-
cially around exam time: the midnight
breakfast, for example. Student funds
always go back to the students.”

College erowth « causes controversy

Students, administrators speak up for maintenance of ‘intimacy’

By Laura CRAVER
Staff Writer

Since Davidson admitted its first
handful of students, the College has
prided itself on the personal attention
that its small size fosters. Students,
faculty, and friends of Davidson con-
sistently rank “intimacy” as one of the
College’s best attributes.

However, in 1957, the College,
already feeling the effects of the Baby
Boom, found itself in danger of aban-
doning its beloved “small size.”

The Davidsonian reported the con-

troversy in a series of articles. The
Trustees favored a gradual increase in
enrollment from a starting point of 850
students. According to one trustee who

' supported the expansion plan, “We must

eet the demands of a growing student

population if Davidson College is to
continue to serve the Church.”

Furthermore, Davidson’s registrar

. atthe time, F. W. Hengeveld, dismissed

claims that the quality of education
would drop with increased enrollment.
“If we have the facilities and the

staff, the College can do just as good job
with a larger group as it can with 850
students.”

-However, negative reactions to the
proposal were both numerous and vo-
cal. Most were quick to defend the
small size of Davidson. “There is an
intangible limit past which point the
complexion and atmosphere of a small
college begins to change,” one student
wrote in an editorial. “Davidson has
now reached that point...but the Trust-
ees have ordered the enrollment in-
creased.”

The student also warned that “‘in-
creased enrollment will also result in
lower standards — based on the quality
of students that are currently applying
for admission.”

Faculty members also rallied in
opposition to increased enrollment. “I
personally believe that we can do a
better job witha smaller group and do it
well,” Acting President Pietenpol said.

Pietenpol went on to add that the
endowment stood at $8,000 per stu-
dent, as compare with $30,000 per stu-

dent that some Northern liberal arts —

college had. He pointed out that an
increase in enrollment would mean of
course a decrease in the endowment per
student.

Pietenpol also emphasized the ben-
efits of small classes where individual
instruction could be given.

“When a class gets above 20 stu-
dents, it may as well have 200 stu-
dents,” he said.

Spencer also expressed a desire to
see Davidson concentrate on raising the
quality level of education, underscor-
ing his belief in Davidson’s responsi-
bility to its constituents “ in terms of
quality, definitely not quantity.”

Another faculty member, Dr.
Davidson, supported Davidson’s small
size by offering two hypotheses in de-
termining the relative value of size: “If
not at least one-third of the member of
(the group) know each other, the body
of students is under the saturation point

_ of aco-existential group; if not at least

fifty percent of them who know each

other also like each other, the body of’

students is under the saturation point of * personal attention and intimacy while

a cohesive group.”

Davidson also chose to speak
about the “intangible values” result-
ing from Davidson’s small college sta-
tus. Among the values he cited were
the quality of student democracy, a
religious concern, a respect for tradi-
tion, mutual trust, and good manners.
“The fact that (the values) are old stuff
reveals that they are a part of the fabric
of your beginning,” Davidson said.

Finally, a student editorial pre-
sented a question of motive, posing
the question, “Could the real motive
be to put Davidson College on a com-
petitive basis in big time athletics?”

“If so, we are proud of Davidson
as she now is,” Davidson said.

Nevertheless, change was inevi-
table, and the College began its gradual
expansion plan by enrolling 890 stu-
dents for the fall semester of 1958.

Today, enrollment lingers around
the 1600 students, nearly twice as many
as 40 years ago.

Yet Davidson remains relatively
small in size, retaining the benefits of

admitting students of superior quality.
