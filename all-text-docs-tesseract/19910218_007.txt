You have to fight the faculty, the
trustees, sometimes fellow. stu-
dents. In order to protect yourself
and your close knit group, you’re
forced to create these walls, and
that’s something I want to stop.

Davidsonian: | find it very fasci-

see how much they can change.
Can we be sure you’ Il keep swing-

Gilmer: I don’tclaim tobe Joan of

Students Attend NOW's Young
Feminist Conference in Ohio

By Sara Sadowski

On Feb. 1-3, Sandra Smith
(senior, chairperson” of the
Women’s Concerns Committee)
and I attended the first National
Organization for Women’s
(N.O.W.) Young Feminist Con-
ference in Akron, Ohio. Approxi-
mately 800 women and men at-
tended, ranging in age from Jr.
High-schoolers to retired persons,
with the majority being from col-
leges and universities. The confer-
ence was held to inspire feminists,
especially young. feminists, to

continue to learn about and to take:

action in the women’s movement.
The group was energetic, enthusi-
astic, motivated, and concerned.
The range of opinions concerning
the women’s movement was great,
and a wealth of experiences and
information was shared. This was
truly a weekend of consciousness-

Taising.

The conference included a se-
ries of speakers, from Molly Yard
(President of NOW) to Hon. Patsy
Mink (Member of Congress, D-
Hawii), speaking on suchrissues as
women’s history, politics, the Gulf
War and peace efforts, lesbians’
and gay men’s rights, abortion,
and consolidation of all efforts for
equality. There were various work-
shops offered on topics such as

-ecofeminism, the ERA, feminist

spirituality, the feminization of
poverty, women’s empowerment,
women in the military, assertive-
ness, women in advertisement, and
rape. The leaders of the conference
activities included students from
U.California-Davis, Yale U., U. of
Minnesota, and various high
schools, as well as lawyers, politi-
cians, and many coordinators of
NOW local chapters throughout
the nation. Diversity was the theme

“of the conference, as seen in the

different informational workshops,
and the variety of women and men
who attend ~

One of the highlights of the
conference was atalk given by Bill
Bell, Jr., a junior at Notre Dame,
whose sister, Becky, died in, 1988
at the age of 17 from complica-
tions due to an illegal, or back-
alley, abortion. Billand his parents
are ona nationwide crusade, work-
ing against state laws requiring
parental notification and/or con-
sent for minors to have a legal
abortion.

In the Bells’ eyes,.these laws
‘restrict and even prevent many
young, pregnant teenage women
from getting a safe, legal abortion;
thus these women turn to the un-
sterile and dangerous methods of
back-alley, or self-induced, abor-

tions. The Bells’ message is this:

it’s better not to know your daugh-

ter/sister had an abortion than to
have her die ofan illegal one. Bill’s
message struck deep in most of the
audience, and encouraged many of
his listeners to prioritize this issue
in their own agenda for action.

The conference was a wonder-
ful experience. For the first time,
both Sandraand I were the minori-
ties, because we are white, hetero-
sexual, middle-class women. The
majority of the conference’s
women and men cut across many
lines, including lines of color,
sexual preference, and income
levels.

The energy, devotion, and
dedication of the women and men
to.efforts for women’s equality
andall that is a partof thisequality,
was tremendous. It was refreshing
to see a room full of college stu-
dents and others attentive to and
active in the social concerns and
movements of our times.

Davidson students need an
affiliation with these types of con-
ferences and organizations in or-
der to get involved in movements
which concern us. If you have any
questions about the conference, fecl
free tocall either myself or Sandra.
We wantto bea partof Davidson’s
consciousness-raising.
