On taking over the
reins of this job from
Jack Hazard, we feel
much like a_ ball-
player who has left
the sandlots to enter
into professional ball

with jthe hope of
learning a few of the
finer points of the
game. There are,

plenty of angles that
we hope to piek up

during our tenure of
sports reporting
which will enable us
to give to the fol-
lowers of the Red and By GORDON SCOTT
Black an accurate,

and even possibly interesting, account of happenings on the
sport’s front.

There will doubtless be times when our views and writ-
ings will be criticized; that is to be expected and even hoped
for, Anything that you may read in Cat Tales is our way of
trying to get some point across because unfortunately we
have never been successful in attempts to imitate other's style
of writing. Your criticism of this column-and the sport's pages
in general is solicited and will be appreciated.

Alumni gym, which has for vears been the most cussed
and discussed building on the hill, had one*last distinction
before giving way to the new plant. Last week the first inter
collegiate weight lifting meet ever held in the South was
staged there. Five strong men from UNC competed ayainst a
sextet of Davidsons (two in the 160-pound class) who bare-
ly edgéd the visiting Tarheels, 2775 to 2730.

The clanging of iron has beeh heard regularly coming
from the weight-lifting room in the basement of the evi,
but few have known that a barbell team was in its embryo
stages. Sevéral meets with YMCA teams in nearby towns
had been runoff, but college competition was another thing.
Organized teams in colleges of the South have been non-
existent. However, this initial meet may start the wheels
rolling, for nearly all of the physical education departments
in colleges and universities offer barbell training. The trouble
has been no organization for intercollegiate competition.

It’s a little late in the year to arrange more meets with
representatives of other schools, but it’s something to work
towards next year. Why not have weight-lifting as a fall and
winter sport. Since the spring sport’s agenda at «Davidson
is pretty well filled, the addition of this new activity in the
Cnnbe before spring would probably command more student
interest, both from the participators and spectators stand-
point.

With the departure of Joe Richert through graduation,
the lifters will lose their guiding force. However, with the
rest of the men being undergraduates, the future of weight
lifting at Davidson looks encouraging. Incidentally, Joe was
about the happiest one person we've ever seen when the final
tabulations showed a Davidson win. Well, he might have
been—the whole show was his brain child. This column salutes
Joe, Grady Spires, Bob Patten, Al Cook, and Roy Johnston—
members of the winning team in the first weight lifting meet
ever held below the Mason-Dixon Line.

The one bright spot in Wednesday afternoon’s tennis
match with Miami was Bo Roddey’s beautiful performance.
Opposite Bo was Tony Vincent, Florida State Municipal
champion. The two appeared to be about evenly matched. but
Roddey displayed his usual consistency and, an unusually
strong back hand. His place shots were often uneanny, and
on one or two occasions, he aced Vincent with his much im-
proved serve. After the match, former Cat coach, and present
Miami Coach Bill Lufler was among those around to con-
gratulate Bo. As he saw Lufler approaching, with a grin
on his face, Bo said, ‘‘Luf taught me my backhand.’’ To which
might be added, he did a mighty good job of it.

After a long lay-off, tennis coach Derrick Barton entered
competitive play in a small sort of way by playing an ex-
hibition match against Dick McKee, pro at the Charlotte

Country Club last Saturday. The occasion was a tennis clinic”

that the two avere conducting for the benefit of Charlotte
youngsters. McKee used his speed to the fullest advantage
as he winded the Cat mentor towards the end and went on to
win 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. Barton attributed his loss partially to the
good ole Southern cooking that his newly-aequired spouse
has been whipping up.
