Denver Harbor introduces us to its “Scenic” route

By Bossy DEMuro

The punk rock band Denver Harbor released
its inaugural CD, “Scenic,” in October of 2004,
then promptly went on tour around the country
to promote it.

This hard-hitting, upbeat punk
album introduces Denver Harbor
tothe nation. Named aftera neigh-
borhood and feared street gang in
Houston, Texas’ East End, the
band was started by Will Salazar,
the former head man of
Fenix*TX.

Salazar, who grew up in this
working-class, Mexican-Ameri-
can neighborhood, quickly went
to work on recruiting bandmates.
After bringing guitarist Chris
Lewis (also formerly of
Fenix*TX) with him, Salazar
went to San Diego to find broth-
ers Ilan (drums) and Aaron (bass)
Rubin to complete the band.

The band placed high impor-
tance on a rhythm section, and
luckily they found a great drum-
mer. At 12, Ilan was named by
“Modern Drummer” as the “Best
Undiscovered Drummer Under
18,” and at 15 had a full page de-
voted to his skills in “Alternative
Press.” In 1999, he became the youngest per-
son to ever play in the Woodstock Festival.

Denver Harbor’s inaugural CD is somewhat
of a throwback to Fenix*TX’s hardest-hitting

Davidson

moments. It also reminds listeners of the re-
fined post-punk sound of The Cure, as well as
the dynamic rock of Nirvana.

Salazar himself is-atypical from the “nor-
mal” punk frontman of today. His voice does
not whine with angst, nor does he seem vul-

nerable to a fault. His vocals fit very well within

the band’s tight rhythms, and his vocal range
is fairly good.

At times, he flattens out, but when he is

to be a hall counselor or resident advisor?

backed by heavy guitar play, his voice comes
alive.

With Ilan Rubin’s rhythm-dominating per-
cussion, the band’s refined sound distinguishes
it from much of the punk rock of today. At the
beginning of the first track, “Xenophobia,” Ilan

introduces listeners to the band with
a distinctive sequence of percus-
sion.

Following up on track two is
“Picture Perfect Wannabe,” a vi-
cious song that lashes out against
the pop music of today, especially
singers who do .not write their own
songs. This track was the first single
the band released off its album,
gaining attention over the internet
and on the radio.

The CD also includes fan favor-
ites “Outta My Head,” “The Ride,”
and “Way Back Home,” as well as
the power ballad “All I Want,” and
the punk sound of “My Holiday
(Save Me).”

“The Ride” reminds me of the
tough reggae-punk of bands like the
Police and other earlier punk acts.
The guitar and drum play in “Way

Back Home” is reminiscent of mid- -

90s acts like Tonic.
After beginning a tour with the
band Unwritten Law, Denver Har-
bor played shows across the country in Octo-
ber and November; however, Unwritten Law
canceled the tour due to personal problems in
December. Denver Harbor has yet to announce

ollege Residence Life Office

the booking of another tour.

This is a strong inaugural effort from the
band, which has‘received internet interest for
several months after releasing several singles
on www.purevolume.com.

In the past, the band landed gigs alongside
Sugarcult, Flogging Molly, Dashboard Con-
fessional, Story of the Year, the Used, and Bad
Religion, some of rock and punk’s top acts
today.

The CD comes as a reflection of the diverse
influences the band members have, but also
serves as a notice of where the band is going in
the future.

Their refined sound, difficult to define as
punk, is a throwback to hard rock acts of the
80s and 90s, thus bringing up the aforemen-
tioned comparisons to Nirvana, the Police, the
Cure, and others.

Whatever will follow, Denver Harbor lands
on the scene with quite an introduction. Salazar
and his fellow band mates give notice to punk
and rock fans alike. With flowing guitar
rhythms, as well as a fantastic drummer, Den-
ver Harbor is sure to land bigger gigs in the
near future.
