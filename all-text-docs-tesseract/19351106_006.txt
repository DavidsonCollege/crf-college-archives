Y.M. C. A. Organizes Hall
And Floor Devotionals

The “Y” has organized again this
year, the hall and floor devotional
services, which have been a feature
of “Y’’ work for a number of years.
A leader has been appointed for
each hall, to see that the meetings
go forward all right, two or three
times a week, and also to help those
on the hall who may be in trouble,
or having difficulty in getting accli-
mated. :

These meetings, it is hoped, will
serve as a bond, drawing closer to-
gether thase on the same hall, and
also joining the dormitories and 1
whole college together through one
organization. This will also serve as
a ready means of spreading “‘Y’’ in-
formation throughout the college.

It is hoped that all will be able
to spare
about three nights a week, so as to

to find fifteen minutes

be able to attend these meetings.
Various students take turns at lead-
ing.
