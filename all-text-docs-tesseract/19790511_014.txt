Music Review

The Dead can still shake down a street

By JIM VITHA
Staff Writer

There have been many criti-
cisms levied at the Grateful
Dead as of late. Their latest
album, Shakedown Street.
While having many fine points,
Was met with mixed reviews
and mediocre commercial suc-
cess.

Granted, the Grateful Dead
could be considered mere ves-
tiges of a musical era somewhat
forgotten in these days of disco
and pluralistic rock and roll.
However, seeing the Grateful
Dead at the Charlotte Coliseum
last Thursday, May 4, assuaged
any fears that the Grateful
Dead should be considered a
washed-up remnant of the six-
ties.

The Charlotte date was the
first date of their new tour and
while they had some sound
difficulties, the band played
with an intensity that was
almost overwhelming at times.
The crowd at the coliseum was
extremely enthusiastic and ty-

‘ion has been viewed with some
disdain by more traditional
Grateful Dead fans; however,
the album definitely has merit
in its own right. Many in the
audience were awed by the
immense sound and harmonies
delivered by the band during
this song as well as during the
different solo efforts put forth
following the song.

Jerry Garcia is still, unques-
tionably, one of the most ac-
complished and professional
guitarists playing today. When
accompanied by Phil Lesh they
make up a duo that ranks with
such the Rolling
Stones’ Keith Richards and Ron
Wood. Their improvisational
jamming technique is unique
and at the same time artistically
inspiring.

The Grateful Dead can pro-
duce as much energy and ex-
citement as any rock band can.
However, the songs take on a
interesting,
sound which leaves the listener

music rather immensely. The
concert proved this fact and
displayed the talents of a band
who, throughout the years,
have consistently put out good
music, whether on an album or
live on stage.
