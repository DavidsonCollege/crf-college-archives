A REVIEW

‘PURPOSE
To those who have had
neither the time nor the in-
clination to readvall five com-
mission reports in their en-
tirety, I offer this review.
PROCEDURE
Prior to writing this -re-
port I carefully read the com-
mission reports,
help from my friends when-
ever I encountered a partic-
ularly difficult passage. I
noted items of interest and
condensed these notes into
section three, findings.
FINDINGS
The playing fields of Eton.
The most outstanding aspect
of the report on athletics, is
its admirable brevity. This
is probably as it should be,
since the question of subsi-
dized athletics is largely one
of finance and as such can
be presented more effective-
Jy in figures than in words,
The commission — should
have better” explained its
figures, however. The re-
port does not indicate  ex-
actly what is meant by to-
tal net savings: ‘‘the total
net savings if all subsidiza-
tion were eliminated would
be approximately $54,000."
Further on, however, the
commission states: “‘Assum-
ing that subsidized football

CONCLUSION

Unfortunately, the writing
in the commission reports is
the typical mediocre product
of committee mentality. With
few exceptions, the reports
are not worth .the time it
takes to read them.

RECOMMENDATION

When, as the Commission
on Extra-Campus Responsi-
bility recommends, the col-
lege institutes continuing ed-
ucation, one, of the first
courses to be offered should
be basic English composi-
tion, with emphasis on writ-
ing the research, paper; this
course should be a prerequi-
site for all commission work.
