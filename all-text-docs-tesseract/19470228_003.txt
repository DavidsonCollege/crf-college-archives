PORTS
COPE

By SAM ERVIN

Now that the coming Southern Conference Basket-
ball Tournament is a major topic of conversation around
the campus, one hears numerous comments, printable and
otherwise, concerning the methods used to select the
eight teams that compete in the annual event. It is com-
mon knowledge that the won-lost records of the 16 con+
tenders play an important part in determining which

eschools will be represented. However, the majority of the

cage fans are convinced that this is the only basis for
the choices. With this belief in mind it’s easy to under-
stand why Mr, Average Fan has been rather free with his
criticism. The chief objection seems to be that several
teams have neglected to tangle with many leading quintets
and that they as a result have better records than some
other clubs who faced a larger number of the pace set-
ters. No one could quarrel with this line of argument if it
were true that the league officials did not take the quality
of each team’s opponents, etc., into consideration he-
fore they make selections. Actually, a little known device
has been used to prevent this and other more obvious
inequalities from_keeping the strongest teams out of the
tourney upon several occasions. :

, When the Tournament Committee, com-
posed of Eddie Cameron (Duke), J. L. Von
Glahn, (North Carolina State), “Monk” Younger
(Virginia Tech), and Norman Shepard (David
son), meets in Raleigh on March 2 to name the
47 contenders their final decision will be based
on two things. The first, and by far the most im-
portant factor is, of course, the actual wins and
losses acquired during the regular season, but
great emphasis will also be placed upon the rat-
ing sheets submitted by the loop’s sixteen cage
coaches, These sheets will contain lists, compiled
by the individual mentors, of the ten teams
which they consider to be the class of the league.

The ratings will be based on 1—team’s per-

centages of victories; 2—teams’ game _ perfor-
mances and 3—strength and number of teams’
opponents. Altho there is no specific requirement
that a team must play a certain number of games
before it becomes eligible for tournament parti-

cipation, this method forces the various colleges
to schedule contests with clubs of all calibers.
Only last season Furman with 7 wins in 1! starts
was not invited because 4 of its games were with
the same opponent.

As we go to press only State, North Carolina, Duke,
and‘South Carolina are definitely assured of berths for
the Durham festivities. Two other cage crews, George
Washington and Maryland, should have little trouble in
earning invites during the week by|whipping two of the
loop’s cellar dwelling aggregations, the Citadel and
V.M.I. The Univ. of Richmond will probably lose its
only remaining game to Wake Forest but this should
not prevent the Virginians from receiving a bid with
the Deacs, Washington and Lee, Davidson, and William
and Mary still in the race, interest is centered on the
struggle for the eighth slot, the outcome of which should
be all but determined (on a percentage basis, at least):
by the time that this column appears. From this corner
it seems that the Generals have the inside track for they
should easily defeat V.P.1. and William and Mary. The
Indians, however, scalped the lads from Lexington last
week, and should this happen again the Deacons could sew
up the invitation by upsetting Duke. The Wildcats only
chance to enter the select circle lies in a victory over Fur-
man, coupled with twin losses for both Wake Forest and
W&L. William & Mary’s possibilities are even more
remote.

Altho on the surface there seem to be no
major schedule discrepancies this season, it isn’t

to bet your shirt on any eight clubs until the

official list is made public, for as was pointed

out above actual won-lost records are not all

important. There ‘is also the possibility that

“more than eight teams may be invited. This hasn’t

happened in quite a while but if there was ever

a time when such action. was warranted, it’s now.
