Irish-Cat Matchup Dictates

Roundball Pro

As we get closer to that fateful
Saturday in February when
Davidson meets third ranked
Irish Notre Dame, the talk has
been more and more of a
possible upset. Anyone who
has seen Notre Dame the last
two weeks surely knows that
such an upset, while pleasant
to think about, would be quite
a feat.

In order to provide the
reader with a personnel guide,
and the expert with a bone of
contention, here is a highly
subjective comparison of the
two squads.

First, Notre Dame.

The Guards: Gary Brokaw-
A smooth operator with a
basketful of moves, but a ten-
dency to commit turnovers,
Brokaw is almost impossible
to stop when he’s hot. He has a
tendency to make the im-
possible shots, but miss the 15
footers. Not a_ high-
percentage shooter from
the outside, he penetrates
well. If Brokaw gets off to a
fast start and hits the out-
side shots early, it could be a
long night for the Wildcat

Dwight Clay- An erratic
ballplayer, Clay operates best
in pressure situations. He
doesn’t score a lot of points,
but he can be tough in the final
minutes. If it gets close to-
wards the end, look for the
Irish to go to Clay on the point
or baseline, or Shumate up the
middle.

The Forwards Gary
Novak. The forgotten man of
the Irish starting five, Novak
is a workmanlike forward
who'll dig for the loose balls
and go for the garbage basket.
While a steady performer, it is
doubtful whether his ef-
fectiveness, or lack of it, will
drastically alter the outcome
of the game. |.

Adrian Dantley- Next to
Shumate, Dantley has the best
raw talent on the Notre Dame
team. A spectacular forward,

man, he is already averaging

The Center - John Shumate-

make an early departure if
Davidson's hopes of an upset
are to be realized. ;
The Bench - Notre Dame's

five, is nevertheless adequate.
Bill Paterno, a freshman hot-
shot from New Jersey, 1s an
adequate forward with a good
outside touch. Ray Martin is a
guard who occasionally spells
both Clay and Brokaw. The
Irish don’t lose much when
they substitute Paterno for

Novak, but Martin does not
have the moves of either
Brokaw or Clay.

Beyond these two, Irish
have little in the way of bench
strength. If Shumate gets in
early foul trouble, they could
be in trouble.

For Davidson

The Guards - Mike Sorren-
tino- Mike has been very hot of
late, fulfilling all early-season
expectations and more. Hit-
ting the outside shot, making
the passes and playing tough
defense, Mike is at present
providing the kind of floor
generalship the team lacked
in the early going. However,
against Notre Dame he has to
put everything together and
try to contain the thrusts of
Brokaw andor Clay.

Jay Powell - Jay has been a
pleasant surprise for the Wild-
cats, his defensive quickness
and bold outside shooting
taking up some of the slack
left by the injury to John
Falconi. However, Powell suf-
fers occasional defensive lap-
ses, which could be fatal if
they come too frequently
against the opportunistic Irish
guards.

The Forwards - Greg Dunn-
A swing forward or guard,
Dunn is capable of un-
believable offensive moves,
yet he blows hot and cold.
Defensively, it’s doubtful
whether he can stay with the
taller Novak or quicker Dan-
tley. He’s simply going to
have. to outscore his man if
Davidson is to stay close.

Larry Horowitz- A hustling,
if unartistic forward,
Horowitz’s play closely

have done well in his absence,
they have to miss his scoring

and often-overlooked —

defensive skills. At present, it
is unlikely that ‘‘the Falcon’”’
can be one hundred percent ef-
fective. If he isn’t, the chances
of an upset will be mighty dim.

The Centers - Collectively or
individually, neither Sheldon
Parker nor Eppa Rixey is a
match for the taller, stronger,
quicker Shumate. Though
they are improving rapidly,
neither has played up to his
potential so far and there is lit-
tle likelihood that this will

enostication

the Davidson pivotmen are
going to have to try to draw
Shumate into early foul
trouble. How successful they
are may determine whether
the game is a battle or a rout.

The Bench - Davidson has
eight potential starters to
Notre Dame's six. The edge
here is a slight one to the Wild-
cats. Tom Verlin, having per-
formed brilliantly of late, adds
an added dimension of ver-
satility to the Davidson at-
tack. If Notre Dame gets in
serious foul trouble early.
start looking for a surprise.

Summary - On paper, it
doesn’t look very close. David-
son makes fewer turnovers at
the guards, and has an edge in
shooting percentage both from
the field and at the foul line.
Add to this the fact that David-
son has been very hot since the
New Year, and you might ex-
pect a close game.

However, the Irish are
deceptive. While not a good
percentage team, they never-
theless have a big edge in the
forecourt due to thepresence of
Shumate and Dantley. With
Brokaw firing from 15 feet and
Shumate getting the tip-ins, it
looks like the Wildcats are
going to be in for a long,
physically demanding game.
