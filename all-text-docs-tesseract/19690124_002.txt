Fraternities Itinerary °

No mental patient ever had a strait
fackvt 40 confining as the one that
is being imposed an Davidson frater-
nities iy their national offices

Admittedly, there are a few things
that can be sald for national frater
nities. but they are very few indeed
When you start listing their ccvan-
tages, Vou run out of items pretty
quickly. ;

For all that natiowals require —
many dollars and many rules — they
offer comparatively little in return.
A gaudy pin, a name that makes con-
+versaGeu fodder back home, perhaps
some house furniture, a few schelor-
ships and funds from which to borrow.
T's hardly waurth the price.

Emtaneipation from national bend-
ape. on the other band. would do
much for Patterson Court.

For one thitig. nioney that could he
spent locally would not be sunk into
the abyz« of national voffers (nae
Rouse here estimates it would save
itself aver 24000 annugllyt. For att-
ether Davidsoa houses could abandon
tae anackramstic rules and ritual

hecuspecus that feve been hanced
down for vears by a bunch of elightly
tight, bact-slapping ald fogeys at vear-
iv fraternal conventions And, of
courge, we would he spared all the
superfluens paperwork and the O¢-
cisional yigits of national prand dra-
gens and other assorted big-wigs.

Most of ail, though. gaing local
wauld be a long stride toward fixing
what is sclevousiy wrong in Davidsen’s
one-sided secial prietuse. Freed from
the shackles of national offiees, the
Davidson houses wottld be in an itt
finitely better position in work for
alternative outlets that provide social
apportimities for every student on
camps, be it through 100 percent
affitlation or wihat-have-you,

In fact, if going focal doesn't start

opening other doacs — for all students -

— then it's not worth the trip. I
ghauld never be conceived aé an end
in itlé — only a slart taward other
ends.

We would be slightly deranged nat
to try to shad the strait jacket.

In The Bologna Class

One of the candidates for SGA presi-
dent recommended this week the hir-
ing of a professionat admissions re
erniter. “Student recruiters irom here
have found st hard to follow & profes-
atonal recruiter from 4 place like Har
vard,” he said, “We seed ane or
selves.”

Granted, Harvard is a tough act to
follow. especially ior x college with
@ pronounced regional atmogphere,
Bet the problem of recruiting invol-
ves more than airing a traveling rep-
fesentative. In facet, the Admissions
Office here hes found that manv high
school counselors hold professinnal
recruiters in low regard. Many would
preier mature, well-prepared student
representatives over professional
salesman types.

In most cases « salesman ts only
25 good as his sproduet. Naturally, it
ig ensier to sell steak caver bologna
and Marvard over Davidson, 7 mat-
ter if the salesman is a student o¢ full-
tine professional. This will continue
to be the case, until Davidson's name
is spread north of the Potomac and
west of the Catawha.

Of course a recruiter would help.
In fact, we hope the college will hire
one in the near future, and we under-
stand such a move is being consider-
ed. But. on the other hand, this is not
going to be a solution to admission
woes. Until Davidson undertakes the
bold steps: which have been debated
in the last few years, its representa-
tives will st be in the belogna class

Possible Merger Mate

_There are geod dealz at Mary Bald-
win.

The Virginia girls’ college, former
home of President Spencer, has ap-

pinted a new president. William Kel-
ly, currently head of the onors col-
lege at Michigan State. And in nuws-
paper interviews last week, Dr. Kelly
expressed his interest in the ides of
Mary Baldwin's going coed hy merger
with a2 men's school

Baldwin is a merger mate that any
haughty bachelor would be proud to
get. It has satietactory academe stan:
dards and a student body af 750
women. It has no room for further
expansion at its present campus and
would have to move to merge.

For a men's college considering
going coed by merging with 3 women's

college whieh would establish a cp-
ordinate campus adjacent to it. Bald-
win loaks like good deals.

Davidson College has been fallow-
ing a policy of educational virginity
Jong enough. Drinking in our rooms
is no substitute for feminine com-
panionship. The booklsh but
young scholars who throng the halls
of Chambers each day and the cam-
puses of Queens, Converse et al each
weekend need a social outlet closer
to home, one that will foster less
Superficial attitudes toward the op-
posite sex than we now have. We need
to learn that girls are people, too.

it cannot be maintained ihat the
process of etiucatton proceed: most
Tapidly in a unisexual environment.
Dovideon College will never have a

The Power Of The Student Nigger

The position af the student is analogous to that of
the nigger.

The nlgger—that ludicrous Southernism for the
black man. The term jmpties inferiority, disesfran-
chisement and, in general, political impotence,

In tho black revolution which Js
now taking place, the nigger has -
found that the surest way for him
in become a Back Man, with rights
and equallty, ia ta exorcise bis power
of coercion, the creation of palitical
and economic tensions whieh intins-
date the white establishment. This
tension brings results.

Escalate these tensions {o a fever

pitch, and create the ultimate wen- vy
pon, the riot. A
Students have [his same sort of

power, the powar of coerclon and,
if necessary, the scare the-hell-oul-of-em power of the
riot.

Bui, paradoxically, these student powers at Davic-
gon are cloaked im that smorphougs term, student.
“save ramet.”

Stedent “government” tk no government. mainly
bevanse ihe real legislative power al Davidson resides
nol with the students, hut with the faculty and admin:
istratien, and ultimately with the irustees,

Sure, student “gevernment™ can provide more
hones in the dorms. more vending machines. And
(can draw up a new constitution and a code of re-

sponsibility,

But when snajor changes occur, they are brougit
about by the vote of the faculty and then, finally, by
a vote of the trustees.

At best, student “government” can only be a iob-
bying force, an organized group that will pressure
the faculty who in turn will pressure the trustees,
This pressure, this coercion is the power that brings
about change on this campus.

Student “government,” then. is merely 3 euphem:
ism. A students’ Inabby would be more accurately de-
scriptive.

t am convinced that if changes are to be made on
this campus, they will be the result of searing hell
out of the faculty, administration and trustees.

The changes of the past seem-tn have been brought
about in same manner. Simple coercion was
enough in each case, Nobody threatened violence, bit.
student niggers could have.

Take the abolition of required vespers, for Instance.
The student niggers who slept through vespers. who
wrote letlets during the service, who came dressect
In blue jeans, and best yet, who passed out drunk on
the Moor of the balcony of the Davidson College Pres-
byterlan Church during vespers. first of all convinced
the student “government,” if it needed convincing,
that the vespers services added nothing to religiosity
at Davidson. So the process of coercion began. The
faculty became convinced that vespers should be
abolished, and then the factulty convinced the trus-
tees. Voila, no more vespers.

The same thing goes for the Code of Responsibility,
which is another Davidson euphemism that translates
“drinking on campus” and ‘women in the dorms.”

Student niggars first showed their power of coer-
cion by flagrantly disobeying the facutty's drinking
rule. And the administration really couldn't exercise
their power for the rule's enforcement.

Student niggers continue to. show their power of
enercion by fornicating in the dorms——admittedly,
this violation is not nearly so openly observable 03
drinking violations were in the past.

But the fact is that Davidson had “open dorms”
before anyone ever thought about a CRAP repart.

So, in abolishing the drinking rule and apening the
dorms, the same processes of coercion brought about
change. The catch to all of this is that students merely
appear to have legislative power when in reality stu-
dents have only coercive power,

So, now that everybody Is duly elected, student
eee men” can continue io perpetuste its owa
myth.
