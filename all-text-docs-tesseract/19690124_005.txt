The Skin Team, Revisited

Lact year ihe word “skin team" became synonymots
with the second leam, the scrubs, the AYOs (All you
others), or whatever saw want io eal] ihoase pluvers
who sit and watch. This year. now that half lhe sea-
son is gone. 1 can evalunte the “69 version of the
Davidson skins.

Cheosing o skin team is very different from finding
a starting five. Instead of picking oul the plavers from
a group at the beginning of the season, you take
what's left. This year the remains are Tony Orsbon,
fox DeMoisey, Jan Postma, Duncan Postma, and my-
self. Billy Pierce is a skin team skin. 1 gucss that's
hard to beat.

With the exception of Duncan, the members of this
year's skin team are veterans, Tony and 1 are two-
year letter skins while Fox and Jan have one year of
skin experience under their belts. Duncan and Billy
are starting to get the hang of the type of game we
play but they still need a little work.

Gono from last year’s skin team are Tom Youngdale
and Bob Pickens, In practice we miss Tiger Tom's
ability to rebound using his head, arms and feet. Also
at Limes J wish Bob was back ‘to throw in his running
left handed hiook shot from the corner, Still, despite
tbe absence of these two we have what I feel is one
of the betler skin teams in Lhe nation.

Tony Orsbon is our All-American skin team canti-
date this year Last year he took all-conference skin
honors easily and i's bard to find a more dedicated
skin anywhere in this part of the country. Tong re-
ceives no scholarship and plays strictly for the glory
of the skin team, whatever that is. At times, different
skins get their chance to play with the starters and
tend to lose their identity. Tony always knows where
he’s best suited and even if he gets a chance to play
with the shirts he probably will refuse.

This year Lefty has short-stopped the process of
naming the skins in practice when we have a scrim-
mage. He just looks at me and tells me to get “my
team” out on the floor. He then tells me what to run
and we roll into action.

The skins usually run through the opposition's of-
fensive plays the day before Davidson is scheduled
to play a game. 1n this way we get to know their plays
and offense sometimes better than the oppositiun does.
Instead of our usual run-and shoot type of play at
the end of a game, I have always thought it would be
fun if the skins would run the opposing team's of.
fense. It might surprise somebody, including ourselves.

The main difference between this year's skins and
last season’s bench boys is that we lack height. Ton
ends wp guarding either Maloy or Cook along wit
me, Jan tries to stop Krol] while Duncan draws O'Neill
or Huckel. The starters usually overpower us with
their height, but we do have some pride and at times
we give them a good game.

Before the Woke Forest game last week when the
television announcer was introducing the starting line-
ups we thought about lining the skins up in front of
the bench and have each player sit down when I cal-
led his name. Likewise, whenever you ask 2 skin how
he did in a game he'll probably say he hit 60 or 70

percent, in the warmups. Incidentily, Jan’s been hav-.

ing a bad year, hitting only about 50 percent, but
he’s been taking tough shots, so we excuse him.

Aftor Kroll and Cook were injured in the VMI game,
Lefty told the team in a meeting Monday that he want-
ed ail of us ready to go on Thursday “in case our
number came up.” After we heard this, Fox turned
to me and whispered, “I don'l think my number has
ever been on the wheel.”

In fairness fo Lafty I have to explain that the skins
are treated Jike shirts In regard to awards, Even
though we don't receive the publicity the starters
do, we get the same number of free tickets, the same
treatment on road trips, the same kind of watch after
a tournament. and the same amount of meal money.

The starters get the glory and the praise for winning
which they certainly should. Our satisfaction is per-
sono. Still, ] have to agree with Tony, who said there
is only one way Davidson College would ever retire
his uniform. He would have to steal It.
