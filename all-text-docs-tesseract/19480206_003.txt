The Jayvee Wildkitten squad, recently reduced from
their pre-exam strength of twenty-three men, now number
only nine. They lost-a mighty good man in Mel Griffith,
a freshman who gave over his cage activities for action on
the mat. A good floor player as Well as a eraek shot, Mel was
probably the most promising man in the Kitten line-up.

With the help of the third string varsity, the Jayvees
have racked up two wins and a loss since exams, According
to Coach Shepard's instructions, the third stringers play ten
minutes out of every half, and they sometimes see a little more
action when the going is rough, Even their added strength
didn’t help the ‘unlucky dawgs’’ much against Belmoat Ab-
bey last Friday night. The score was tied, 56-56, when the
final whistle blew, but the ball was still in the air, and it made
a detour through the Belmont net before it came to rest.
Spectator Moneyhan’s comment was elassie—if unprintable.

_, The previous night the Kittens had invaded CC-UNC
and defeated the Owls for the second time of the season, hold-
ing Leland Helms, formerly of renown as a Central High
cager and gridder, toa total of one point. Helms had just re
turned to the Owl roster after being away beyond the blue
somewhere and was eXpected to turn the tide for the birds, His
boys came cut on the bad end of a 43-35 seore,

The only other game that didn’t go the way the Kit-
tens wanted it to was the Oak Ridge game. which they lost by
three points. They meet High Point and P. J. C. before the
best college newspaper on the hill comes into your hands,

Old man weather hisself postponed the Duke-Davidson
basketball game last Saturday night. The game may or may
not be played later. depending on the fortunes of war and
conference standings, It was the Dukes themselves who post-
poned the game, and it was not until after the dauntless Wild-
cats had pushed through the drifts from Chapel Hill to Dur-
ham that they found out that game was cancelled, Therefore,
it iS up to us whether the game will be played at some later
date,

Friday’s game against Carolina’s giant White Phan-
toms showed the Wildcat mettle and put.the ‘Cats back in the
running, even though Tar Heel reserves wore them down
in the last half of the second half. The Red and Blacks held
them down to a tie at the half, and it was partly reserve
strength, partly because John “The Hook’’ Dillon had the
green light on his famous hook shots that they didn’t come
closer to a coveted win. Dillon, an All-American two years ago
and a benehwarmer last year, has his moments, and one of
them was Friday night, it seems. The Cats’ good showing
proves that they have got the stuff as well as the spirit to
stand up to any team in the league.

The news that Lonie Bingham, one of the stronger ¢on-
tenders for thecfifth place in the Starting line-up, flunked
out is a blow to Davidson basketball. He will be sorely missed
by the ‘Cats who lack nothing so much as reserve streneth.
His plueky spirit and ocedsional antics will be missed by
Wildcat fans.

In their first collegiate match, with Auburn, the wrestling
team bowed to: Auburn by a score of 19-10, They meet both
State and Carolina during the latter part of this week, and
will be hard pressed on both occasions .They will appreciate
a good crowd, we are sure, for the State meet which will be
run in our own ‘it ain’t much but its’ all.we got’? gym Sat-
urday afternoon, We have some good material, and there
should be thrills and spills enough for all.
