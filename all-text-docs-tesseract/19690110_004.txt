1969 IMAC Basketball Has Balance, Strength

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

The 1969 IMAC basketball
league will be one of the best
balanced in recent years. It
is highly unlikely that any
team will be undefeated. and
at least four teams have an
excellent chance to win the
championship. The Phi Delts.
Sigma Nus, Pikas. and Kap
pa Sigs are all in the run
ning for the title.

The following iz a presea
son analysis of these four
teams and the rest of the
teams in the league in their
predicted order of finish by
the Berry Poll.

Phi Delts

The Phi. Delts should per-
haps be given a slight edge
for the title because of their
winning tradition. a corps
of returnees from last year's
12-0 team and a strong group
of sophomores.

The Delts will Ie strong in
the front and back courts. In
the front line. Gene Early.
Ed Dobbs. John McCammon.
Terry Esterkamp. Tom Way
and Ray Logan will provide
rebounding and inside’ shoot-
ing.

‘mores and juniors.

The Delts will also have
one of the best backcourts in
the league in Jim May, Jack
Caldwell and Garth Hamp-
ton. Others who wil! see ac-
tion are ClHff Duke and
George House.

Sigma Nu

Experience is the word to
describe the Sigma Nus. They

son. The Nus are led by
Bruce Weidner. Steve Hayes
and Toby Westmoreland. At
center will be coach Calvin
Murphy, the first Negro
coach in the league's history.
The other starter will prob.
ably be either John Oliver or
Tom Skinner. Others who will
see action are George Arm-
strong. Dale Vash. Clark
Nickerson and Keith Sykes.

The Nu's only problem
seems to be a lack of depth,
although Weidner’s knee is a
question mark and Hayes
may have to miss several
games because of a job.

Pikas

The Pikas are a very young
team. predominantly sopho-

“Toughies” From Way Back

At the outset of the current basketball season,
Lefty Driesell announced that this year’s. edition of
Wildcat basketball would face the toughest sched-
ule any Davidson team had ever faced. And a glance
at the schedule verified the. fact ‘that the schedule

was tough.

Still, some people were skeptical about the label
of “toughest” being attached, so we decided that we

But the tough seasons never really appeared
until 1911, the year which saw the initiation of the
intense rivalry between Davidson and the Charlotte

YMCA. After splitting a
neither team was ever a

pair of contests that year,
ble to establish a substan-

tial advantage in series competition.

Other YMCA competition was subsequently
added, coming from Statesville, Asheville, Winston-
Salem and Concord. But Davidson was not satisfied
with the level of competition. so in 1914 captain
Tom Somerville and the rest of the Wildcats took

ville YWCA. The team

t of the decade, the States-
from Statesville, however,

provided little competition, and one team member
-was led to comment after the 39-21 victory that they
played “like a bunch of girls.”

The 1920's saw the advent of the series between
Davidson and the service (that is. service clubs, not

service academies).

In those years, when F. W.

Hengeveld was coach. Davidson added to its sched-
ule the teams from the Durham and Lynchburg Elks
Clubs. It might be noted that Davidson was com-
pletely outclassed in these contests, losing 37-23 to
Lynchburg and 49-33 to Durham in the initial out-

ings, unable to overcome

the tough pressing defense

which these teams employed.

In the years of Coaches Monk Younger and
Flake Laird the Wildats branched out into the realm
of the tougher opponents, facing such “toughies” as
the Carolina Monograms, the Barium All-Stars, the
Atlanta Jewish Program Club, the Statesville Spirals.

fiom the Statesville A.A., a game which one player
described as a “sobering experience, in spite of the
Statesville team’s shaky method of play.”

The years of Coach Norman Shepard brought
in competition from Hanes Hosiery, the U. S. Rab-
ber Company, Carlton Mills, the Shelby Lions, J. 0.
Jones (pretty much a one-man team), Morris Field,
Duke Power and the McCrary Eagles. As late as
1935, the Eagies were still hampering Davidson.
They won in that year, 100-71.

Indeed, if it hadn’t been for such Davidson stars
as Dean Rusk, who led the 'Cats to an 8-8 season in
1930-31; Grier Martin, who was high scorer the next
year; Footsie Cowan, conference second-h' ghest scor-
er in 1940 and Ed White, who captained the team to
two winning seasons (in a row), Davidson's basket-
ball past might have been very bleak (or at least
bleaxer).

However, it appears that Lefty was right. This
season’s opponents might be tougher than those in
the past. Still, it might be fun to take on the States-
ville YWCA at least once more.

will be a big asset. as coach
Davis Liles has about 12
men who can start. Mark Af-
feldt. Liles, Joe Lansinger.
Brian Smith. Tom Hendren
and Pat. Bray are possible
front line starters, while
Jack Ballenger, Dave Buck.
Gary Cash, Fred Kastner,
Bobby Sanders and Floyd
Strand challenge for the
guard positions.

Says .Liles of this year's
chances, “The teams in the
league should be the best
ever this year, and if our
sophomores come through.
we should finish near the
top.”

Kappa Sigs

The Kappa Sigs have size
and speed and should chal-
lenge for the league title.
The top players are Gordon
Slade. Bob Niebauer, Bill
McKenzie, Peter Boggs. Mike
Kelly, Cooper Brantley, coach
William Brown, Terry Mil-
lar, Al McGraw, Doug Crisp
and Dave Troxler. The team
was hurt by the loss of Gary
Hemric, who is out because
of a shoulder operation.

Brown also noted the tough
ness of the league. ‘There

are six teams in this league
any one of which can beat the
other. We are hoping for a
finish in the top four.”

Sigma Chis

The Sigma Chis will have
a presentable team, but lack
the over all speed and shdot-
ing ability to be a real con-
tender. Board strength will
be one of their strong points,
with Jeff Pflugner and Jim
Long anchoring the front line.

Other players who will see
considerable action are Ed-
gar Exum. Pete Norton. Herb
Clegg. John Saunders and
Doug Haynes.

Betas

If any team is led by one
individual. it is the Betas.
who will depend on Johnny
Baker. Baker describes the
team as ‘deep in mediocri-
ty.” bpt they should not be
discounted, especially with
his presence. They should
finish somewhere near: the
middle of the pack, although
they have the potential to
beat any team in the league
on a given night.

Besides Baker the squad
consists of Ed Terry, Bill

Gdmmon, Henry Marrow,
Mike Culbreth, Jay Bowen,
Macki Reavis. Charles Cow-
sert, Hunter Rice and Doug
Clark.

Phi Gamms

The Phi Gamms have mus
cle and some speed and shoot-
ing ability. However, they do
not have enough of either of
the latter to break into the
top four.

Mike Mikolayunas and Bar-
ry McLean anchor the more
than ample front line, while
Charlie Parks will be the big
man in the backcourt. Others
who will see action are Mike
Bumgardner, Gary Dean-
hardt, Bob Apgar. Tate Ster
rett. Johnny Bryan, Roy

Lane, Jim Buchanan, Jerry

Dean, Jeff Brantley, and
“hatchet men’ Sean McCor-
mick and Ken Totherow. Un-
fortunately for the Gamms.
Ricky Snipes remained on
the varsity: basketball team
too long to be eligible for in-
tramural piay.

speed, depth. and  sopho-

mores. Coach Jim McDowell

“MAYBE IF SHE CUTS HER HAIR WE CAN KEEP HER”

Lefty Plans For Coeds,
Recruits Oklahoma Girl

Davidson's basketball pro
gram jumped the gun on co-
education Jast month. and
now all of the coaches are
looking to each other for an
explanation.

The case in question in
volves Coach Lefty Driesell.
Assistant Coach Terry Hol-
land, a basketball brochure
and a basketball player from
Oklahoma.

The player is a girl: the
brochure was a_ recruiting
brochure: and the blame
seems to be on Holland.

The brochure and recruit.
ing letter went out from Da
vidson to Toni Beckham, of
Lindsay. Okla., and Holland
is still trying to remember
who handed him the recom-
mendation for the sophomore
star of the Linday High Leop
ardettes.

“Toni sure sounded like a
boy to me.”’ Holland said. “I
don't remember who made
the recommendation. But
somebody did make one —
and a fairly strong one—or

we wouldn't have made a
contact.”

Miss Beckham said that
she was flattered by the let-
ter until she read the part
which labeled Davidson as an
all men's school.

“This is probably the only
offer I'll get.*’ she said. “I
don't know why I was mis-
taken for a boy unless it 4vas
my long hair.”

The coaches have said
nothing in regard to whether
Miss Beckham is still being
considered for scholarship of.
fers. but strangely enough.
Driesell received a_ letter
from: Lindsay coach Charles
Heatly, who confirmed her
ability and listed her as the
best girl player in the school's
history.

With Davidson's recent in-
terest in the possibilties of
coeducation, perhaps by the
time Miss Beckham is a sen-
ior a follow-up letter would
be in order.

Until then, perhaps Miss

ested. Driesell hopes so.

Beckham has ‘a few male
friends who might be. inter-

has a fair supply of talent,
but little experience to choose
from.

Those vying for _starting
positions will be Brad Dan-

ielson, Mark. Baker, Jim
Hawkins, Mort Childs, Bill
Clark, Ted Woods, Larry

Flynn, John Durham, Garee
Thomas. Bill Reeves, Ken
Hill and McDowell.

When asked about his squad
McDowell said, “The motto
of the team is: When you are
green you are growing: when
you are ripe, you are rotten."’

KA’s

The KA’s have quickness
and shooting ability, but lack
anyone who can effectively
compete for rebounds, and
that will be their downfall.

Players who will play con-
siderably are George Han-
nen, Danny White, Lou Wil-

liams, John Chalk, Jim.

Crouse, Frank Gray, Pat

Whalen and Roy Stuckey.
SAE’s

Coach Rusty Mickler ex-
pects his SAE forces to be

“much improved’ over their .

poor showing of last season.
If he can get all his players

to show up for the games,
the SAE‘’s may indeed im-
prove.

The top players are K. D.
Weeks, David Hubbard, Bob
Meadows, Charles Brockwell,
Lynn Himes and Tom Mor-
rill. Others who will play
are Dwight Etheridge, Steve
Butler, Teddy Ravenel, Sam-
my Davis, Ed Dannelly,
Mickler and “hatchet man’’
Lew Homer.

Sig Eps

The Sig Eps hope to im-
prove on their 3-9 record of
last season, but with the
strength of the league what
it is. that hope will probably
not be fulfliled.

The Sig Eps’ only board
strength lies in Kent Rhodes,
and he cannot handle the
whole rebounding load alone.
They should be well set in
the backcourt with Fletcher
Hartsell and Wade Shepherd.
Others who will see action
are Dave Shepler, George
Steele, Gary Sigmon, Marvin
Bethune, Rob Hoy, John Bru-
ner and Dan Spencer.

days Davidson's Wildcats top-
pled five foes en route to a.
number two ranking by the
Associated Press and United
Press International. The fol-
lowing is a brief description
of each of those games.

RICHMOND

After. a week's lay-off for
exams, the Wildcats travelled
to Richmond and had to re-
sort to a freeze to preserve
a 62-60 victory.

The decision to freeze
came with 4:18 left in the
game. and Richmond didn't
come out of its tight zone
defense until 40 seconds were
left in the ball game. A fran-
tic shot at the buzzzer by
Richmond’s Picot Frazier,
glanced off the rim, and the
game was Davidson's.

‘Mike Maloy led Davidson
with 20 points.

SOUTH CAROLINA

“,1n a closely fought contest

(both on and off the court).
Davidson stretched its win-
ning streak to five games
with a 62-55 victory over
USC’s Gamecocks.

A capacity crowd of 11,666.
dominated by South Carolina
fans, saw Jerry Kroll erupt
for 23 points to lead the vic-
tory. The game was marred
by a fight near the end of
the game, when the USC
bench emptied onto Doug
Cook after an elbow-throwing
spree began on the court.

MARYLAND

Davidson played the role of

favorite in the Charlotte In- -

vitationat Tournament and
jumped off the first night to
an 83-69 victory over Mary
land.

Maloy was once again the
show stopper fur Davidsyes
as the junior’ pumped ds

points and went: up, for (15

rebounds, while managing to |

block a number of Terp
shots.

Maryland was led by Will
Hetzel. brother of Davidson
All-American Fred, as he
threw in 17 points.

TEXAS

Mike Maloy earned his sec-
6nd straight Most Valuable
Player award from the CIT
the next night as his 28 point
performance led Davidson to
a 98-76 rout of the Univer-
sity of Texas.

Texas surprised the disap-
pointing crowd the previous
night by upsetting favored
Wichita . but the shorter
squad was unable to handle
Davidson in the final round.

MICHIGAN

The weather in Ann Arbor

was below freezing. but Da-

their problems of lack of
size, talent, and organization,
they may win a -few ball
games.

As it is, with Bob Peel
their only really outstanding
player. they will probably
beat only the Pi Kapps.

Other possible players for
the Indies are Bill Funder-
burk, George Purvis, Luther
Moore, Don Sewell, Phil Ha-
zel, Biff Fine. Jim Treva-
than, John Hanselman, Rog-
er Duvall, Mark Thompson,
Bill Shutt. John Reisner,
Dick Anderson, Ken Hayes
and Ray English.

Pi Kapps

It looks as though the Pi
Kapps_ will duplicate their
last-place flickerball finish
in basketball. There is al-
ways the possibility of an up-
set, but in all frankness they
will be lucky to win even one
game.

As a result of their prob-
able finish, the team has de-
cided to play for fun. The
members of this ‘‘Laugh-In”
squad are Jim Smoak, John
Neely, Lewis Tabb, Jim Mc
Nair and Bob Wrenn.

loy’s 20.

Cook was a major factor in
the early half break-away, as
the ‘Cats pulled away from
a 47-40 halftime advantage to
lead 70-47 after only eight
minutes of the second half.
Cook poured in 19 of his
points in the second half.
