tersectional opponent, With not so strong prospects as. were
present at this time last year the quintet will need every con-

ference-win they can get, to be sure of getting that bid to the
tournament at Raleigh which. will close the season in mid-

winter.

“These two. opening conference games may catch the
quint still too inexperienced, -and-green. Only one-man;
Cowan, has played as much as two seasons of regular ball,
and only three others have seen anything like much regu-
lar action. Last year, and during their soph seasons, Hay-
seed Thomas and Benny Harrison played some,-Benny a
good deal last year, alternating with Jim Hogg, who play-
ed a lot, especially toward the end. Outside of these four
men there are none who have played at ail regularly, ‘and
experience counts in basketball, too.

A trip is always hard on the team, and too much is not to
be expected of them, but more competition, more practice, and
more experience should bring-home an improved outfit. Last
week against “Jo” Jones the team looked sluggish and spotty,
missing the hole consistently, and being shown upon the floor
by Earl Ruth's great exhibition of passing. However, many,
-underrated the Jones boys, who had a nice team, and almost
took the ball game. The game did just what it was supposed to
though, by bringing out faults and errors, and showing the
whole-squad-that more practice is needed in all phases. Post
holiday games should find’ a much improved team, with more
coordination, surer passing, and that added experience and
nerve which only actual play can bring.

Watch those boys on this trip. Two conference wins are
in the offing if everything clicks right, and a good start
will head the Cats toward that tourney again.
