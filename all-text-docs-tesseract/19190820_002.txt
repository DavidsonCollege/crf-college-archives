This issue’ of ‘he Davidsonian has
been edited by Mr. Jackson and Mr.
Miles. We confess we are amateurs at
the game but hope it will serve its pur-
pose and help fill in the gap until the
regular student force gets busy next
month. ;

We are sorry to report that Mr. Da-
vid Worth Roberts, editor-in-chief of
The Davidsonian, has been in the hos-
pital in Wilmington with fever. How-
ever, he is improving and will be with
us at opening, we trust. The editorial
on this page was written by him while
in the hospital and mailed in to us.

Best wishes, Dave, for a speedy recov-
ery.

THE PRESENT DAY COLLEGE
MAN’S ATTITUDE TOWARD
“THE FRESHMAN.

The attitude of the College man to-
ward the High School graduate who en-
ters College is rapidly changing. This
is especially true in Democratic Amer- ;
ica. The time when the new man was
thought! of as the “Rat’ is rapidly pass-
ing away, and in many States wiser
heads both in College and out have seen
the foolishness and disastrous result of
thoughtless hazing, and in our owa
State especially this form of petty Col-
lege tyranny has been abolished by law.

This custom of hazing and the atti-
tude of the old college man toward the
newcomer is rapidly giving place to the
new attitude ef helpfulness and brother-
hood. ‘This can be said especially of the
American colleges where the Democratic
spirit of the new age is rapidly gripping
the hearts and minds of the many stu-.
dents within their walls.

Davidson College has not been long
in grasping this new idea of friendliness
between the old and the new students. ;
Not many years ago the new man was _
the blunt of every joke, he was every-'
body’s tody and was forever at the end
of someone’s boot. ‘loday he may enjoy,
the joke with others: his life is not made
miserable by unbearable and unreason-
able chore, and he is welcomed into the,
company of older college men. In the
old college days the Freshman was
barred from many college activities, but
today he may from the start enter into
and enjoy without fear any of them.

On the athletic field he has the privi-
lege of trying out for any team and if hel
shows superior strength and ability he is
placed by the coaches wherever he is best’
fitted.

In the Literary Societies if he tras the
ability of oratory and logical thinking he
may attain a place on the Inter-Collegi-
ate teams and contest with other colleges
for honors.

On the campus and in the dormitories
he may ‘‘walk with case,” never being!
fearful after the snow storm to wait!

DAVIDSON MEN AT CAMP
SAPPHIRE.

Camp Sapphire at Brevard, N. C.,
had a liberal sprinkling of Davidson
men as councillors this summer. Coach
Fetzer’s camp was more popular than
ever this year, there being 198 boys
present when the camp opened the first
of July, ‘To help in the running of the
business end Professor Reed had charge
of the office and A. P. Ormand did the
stenographic work, The other Davidson
men were Spann, Chalmers, Bob and
Romefelt, “Jap”
Cummins, Shields and “Bobby” Long.
From all accounts they are having just
as good a time as anyone else. .

Several Davidson boys have been reg-
ular campers. Macon Reed, Jr., Joe
and Riges McConnell and Ernest Bo-
hanon taking advantage of this splendid
camp. They had a big time and came
back enthusiastic admirers of “Captain
Bill” and the manner in which he con-
ducts the camp.

There are rumors that Brevard is not
so far in the mountains that our repre-
sentatives haven’t had opportunities to
keep in trim. for Senior and Junior
speakings but about that you had better
auiz them:

HEARD AROUND THE STATE.

Every once in a while there drifts
inte the office news of other colleges
around the state. Below you will find
a few items ‘of interest to us.

The following from the North Caro-
lina Tar, Heel: “The campus Cabinet
has conceived the idea of instituting the
‘point system,’ now in use at Davidson,
among the student activities here.”

Wake Forest will have Rev. Mr.
Turner next year as “College Pastor.”
This position is similar to our general
secretaryship, although they are giving it
a different name. Mr. Turner is an
alumnus of Wake Forest and in his day
a great pitcher and tennis crack. He was
in the overseas service of the “Y” and
then a chaplain in the Thirtieth division.
He is a prince of a fellow and Wake
Forest is to be congratulated on securing
him for work among the students.

This year Mr. Ed. King will be the
new “Y" secretary at A. & E. Year be-
fore last Mr. King was student secre-
tary at University of South Carolina and
made quite a success of the work there.
A. & E. is indeed fortunate in getting
two men like King and Fetzer this year.

This was heard at Blue Ridge. The
ecach of a famous Virginia college told
his men: ‘““There are three colleges in
the U. S. that stand out in my mind as
having a distinctive ‘spirit’ all their own.

our honor system, student government
and constitution.

SHADES OF MILTON.

This is rather a sad story, so if you
are not feeling especially bright and
cheerful, start it not. It deals with a
subject that is quite gay, in fact quite
spry and festive but the discourse does
not carry out the promise of the joy pro-
ducing title. The subject is found among
the lines of our friend, the poet, who
was not exactly light and frivolous in
his words and actions but at that time
loosened. up considerably. You remem-
ber how they go:

“Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with
thee

Jest, and youthful jollity,

Quips, and Cranks, and wanton wiles,

Nods, and becks, and wreathed
smiles,”

At that time the nymph was a good
sport but now [I am afraid that the
aforesaid, fairy creature has changed her
nymph-like qualities and has become a
regular Jinx. For good friends there
seems to be no carrier of any kind at all
to bring our Quips and Cranks to us. It
is a case of “vain deluding joys.”

All of which being interpreted is sim-
ply this: ‘Ihroughout the summer the
fellows have been writing in to find out
when the annual would put in its ap-
pearance. Some have started tracers but
as we go to press there is no news con-
cerning it of a definite nature. Here's
hoping that when you arrive it will be
waiting for you and we can say to our
fears on the subject, “Hence loathed
melancholy.”

NEW MEN WILL BE

WHEN THEY ARRIVE.

MET

“Doug” McArn and his Fresh Re-
ception Committee are planning to meet
the new men when they arrive and sec
that they find their way to the office,
room, boarding house and other points of
interest to a man when he first arrives.
So if you are a new man, keep your eye
peeled for some “receptive” looking fel-
‘lows when you hit this town.

They are also planning a big Fresh-
man reception on Monday night after
opening, but about that more anon
Just rest assured it will be well worth
attending both from the standpoint of
“pep” injected into you and the “eats”
that you can. propel into yourself.

So “au ‘voir until the 3rd and 4th
of September and when you hear that
magic call “Daaa-vidson” you will -know
that the Dummy Line is “in the yard”
and we will be there to mect you.

NEW TENNIS CLUB.

This summer a tennis club was organ-
ized on the campus and some “crack”
tennis unloosed for the first time, Next
week a tournament will be held and the
winner will meet all comers in the stu-
dent bedy next month. “The members
were pretty well bunched as to playing

ability at the start but since Ormond

“Minor” has purchased a new racquet
he is a rather dangerous contender for
the cup. The officers of. the club are as
follows: Mr. F. L. Jackson, president,
Mr. R. W. Miles, vice-president; Mrs.
R. W. Miles, secretary; Mr. A. C. Or-
mond, treasurer. The membership of
the club is composed of Messrs. Jackson,
Miles and Ormond and Mrs. Miles.
The club frequently entertains their
friends on the court.

A squad of rookies were shooting at a
target, but no one seemed to be accurate
enough to hit it. An officer who hap-
pened to be passing stopped, took a rifle
from one of the men, and started to fire
at the target. His first shot was a miss,
and, turning to Private Jones, he said.
“That is the way you shoot.” His sec-
ond was also a miss, and, turning to Pri-
vate Brown, he said, “And that is tie
way you shoot.” His third shot was a

: bull's eye. Turning to the men, he said,
“And that is the way I shoot.”—Judge.

FINANCIAL VALUE OF AN
EDUCATION.

In 1917 Dr. A. Caswell Ellis, profes-
sor of Philosophy of Education, made an
extensive investigation to summarize the
financial value of an education. His pa-
per was published by the Department of
Interior, Bureau of Education, as Bulle-
tin No. 22. Some interesting statistics
taken from this bulletin are printed be-
low. — If information along this line
were available for this or last year, with
a much higher scale of salaries in vogue,
a still better showing weuld be made for
higher education.

How Education Pays

Selaries in the New York Bridge Department:

In positions demanding only reading, writing
and arithmatic, $962.00.

In positions demanding High-School and Com-
mercial courses, $1729.00.

In positions demanding High- School and two
or three yeers of College or Technical
education, $2400.00.

MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN.

Most of the boys have been appraised
through the Church papers of the cam-
paign for raising a million dollars for
the Presbyterian schools of North Car-
olina. Dr. M. E. Melvin, field secre-
tary of the Committee of Christian Ed-
ucation and Ministerial Relief, is man-
ager of the campaign and has associated
with him ten capable and experienced
men in this line of work, It is planned
to make practically an every member
canvas of the fifty thousand Presbyter-
ians in North Carolina. Davidson's
share of the million will be $300,000.00.
Here's to the success of the campaign!

TRAIN SCHEDULE.

For the information of the boys com-
ing through Charlotte we would remind
vou that there are but two trains a day,
from Charlotte to Davidson. The first
leaves Charlotte at 8 A. M., the other
at 2 P. M. The Jitney, when it runs,
schedule uncertain, leaves the Buford
Hotel at 4 P. M. and at 11 P. M.

Officials of the Southern Railway have

, assured us that extra coaches will be
provided for September 2nd. 3rd and
‘gth, It may not be amiss to remind
some of the students to have their names
.on their trunks as well as having it
checked. Almost every year in the past
one or more trunks have been lost.
