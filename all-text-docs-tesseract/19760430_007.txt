Magazines offer relevant escape

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

It’s 10:00 on a week night in E.H.
Little Library. You’re through with
your work, but you’re not tired.
You’re not hungry, and you’ve sworn
off television. You want to goof off,
but not blow your time playing frisbee
on the hall.What to do? Well, why not
mosey over to the-periodical shelves
and treat yourself to one of the finest
things civilization has to offer--maga’
zines! Our shelves are filled with
them, and with their help you can
goof off creatively,

Magazines are many things to
many people. Some people write for
them, some sell them, but, whether
it’s The Journal of Symbolic Logic or
T.V. Guide, most just read them.
Easier to read than a book, more fun
than a newspaper, magazines are an
easily accessible source of concise
knowledge and current news.

The periodicals in our library run
the entire gamut, from the purely
technical journals like Journal
of Accountancy and The Herpetologi-
cal Review to more newsstandish
types such as Cycle World and
Seventeen, Top periodical perusers,
however, recognize several journal
genre suited for the general reading
public, including news magazines,
literary reviews, art reviews, intellec-
tual magazines, scientific magazines,
environmental magazines, sports
magazines, and, finally, magazines
just for general enjoyment.

Time and Newsweek dominate the
first category, with U.S. News and
World Report a distant third. Most
people have a favorite among these,
and usually quote from it freely. If
you've been neglecting the news-
paper, catch up on current affairs and
get good features and movie and book
reviews to boot in one of these.

In the second group, The North
American Review is tops, combining
poetry, prose, art and, occasionally,
photography in a quarterly review
which dates back to the 18th century.
Other good ones are Crucible, St.
Andrews Review, Southern Poetry
and The Cold Mountain Review, the
last two often containing work from
professors Holland and Winkler as
well as Charlotte-area poets. Among
the kinkier literary reviews are Fic-
tion and Tales. sate.

The art reviews are generally for
gazing only, the text usually being
worthless for those not particularly
versed in technique and symbolism in
art. Among the journals are Art-
forum, Art Spectrum, Art News, and
American Artist. Surprisingly en-
ough, the ads in these magazines are
often the best. parts, giving full page
examples of art shows around the
country.

If you’ve been hooked on maga-

zines for quite a while then you-:-

probably have a favorite in the genre I
called ‘‘intellectual’’ magazines,
which includes Harpers, Saturday
Review/World, and The Atlantic
Quarterly. These contain in-depth

news analyses, evaluations (often a
bit biased) of presidential candid-‘es,
thoughtful features plus poetry, fic-
tion, cartoons, and movie/book re-

views.

The ’’scientific’’ magazines range
from the layman-oriented Science
Digest to the quasi-technical Scienti-
ic American, a prestigious, very old
magazine which is at times over the
heads of many but is yet fascinating
and is still good for jus glancing
through. Others in this group include

the British New Scientist, Science,

Technological Review, and Psycho-
logy Today. These magazines take
more time than most to be enjoyed
and are suited more for one seeking
knowledge than for the casual brow-
ser (i.e., goof-off).

The environmental magazines are
those which this reporter enjoys
most, particularly Audobon, which
only comes out every quarter but
which contains hours of reading,
including features, editorials, and
fantastic art/photography. Other
favorites are Natural History (which
could also be included in the last
category), Animal Kingdom,  Inter-
national Wildlife and National Wild-
life, the last three which are often
very brief but enjoyable just the
same. All of these magazines are
published by various foundations and
therefore contain the latest news in
environmental legislation as well as
offers for books, trips, seminars, etc,

Sports magazines include the regu-
lar Sports Illustrated and The

Sporting News, and also include more
specialized periodicals much as Run-
ner’s World, Track and Field News,
Coach and Athlete, and Ski.

Last but not least, ‘‘miscellaneous,
general.” or however-you-want-to-
classify-them magazines. Some favo-
rites, are Print, a fascinating quarterly
which covers the latest techniques
and trends in illustrations, adver-
tizing, posters, etc.; National Geo-
graphic, which you probably grew up
with or know about anyway; Smith-
sonian, a popular monthly with
articles ranging from Nepalese cus-
toms to astronomy; Harvard maga-
zine, along the lines of The Smith-
sonian; The Village Voice, a New
York tabloid which has features,
politics, reviews, and great comics
(‘‘Mr. Natural’’ and ‘‘Stan Mack’s
Real Life Funnies’’).

Some other sure bets in the
catch-all category are New Yorker,
whose articles are of dubious value
but whose cartoons are undoubtedly
the best in the business (George
Booth, George Price, Charles Ad-
dams, to mention a few); Soviet Life,
how the other side lives (maybe);
Rolling Stone, when you can find it.

Ones to miss: Accountant's Digest,
just what it says; Army, with ads
along the lines of ‘‘Dow napalm gives
more casualties faster’’; Clavier,
worthless, worthless, worthless....

Well, there you have a brief taste of
all the enjoyment to be had when
you've nothing to do. Read, browse,
enjoy, but pleez, put the magazines
back where you got them!
