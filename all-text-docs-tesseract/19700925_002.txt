looming in front of every bit of draft

nation, it is imperative that the voices
of dissent with American military in-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Student Believes Rowland -
‘Has Gone A Bit Too Far’

To the Editor:

I always nave serious mis-
givings about a letter to
THE DAVIDSONIAN criti-
cal of something on campus
because I am naive enough
to think that when opinions
are put into print that they
are giving a certain cre-
dence which may be unjusti-
fied (a point well made in
last week's lead editorial).

It is even harder for me
to bring myself to verbally
castigate a student, but this
time Paul Rowland has gone
a bit too far.

It is difficult to give at-
tention to someone precoci-
ous enough to title his
column ‘‘PERcept,"’ even if
that title employs such a
really catchy use of his ini-
tials; but having to digest
what appears beneath the
masthead is worse!

Future Hope Rests With
Davidson Student Body

To the Editor:

(Part of my summer was
spent away from campus in
other lands. The experience
served to ‘‘unlock”’ a stream
of thoughts about Life at Da-
vidson which I would like to
share. I will express them
as a list of inspired convic-
tions: -

1. Does any one of us rea-
lize just how much human
talent and energy exists on
this campus. for improving
the life of the people around
the world? Davidson does
have one of the ablest stu-
dent bodies in the nation.
...Among one thousand plus
men’ (and now the women)
there truly: exist the minds
and the hearts required to
establish a new golden age
in a, country yet young—a
country which some at home
and abroad ‘would consign
prematurely to a nadir of
influence and morality.

Yes, | assert that in an
Age of Realization we can
control the arms race, nego-
tiate the divisions of the
races, and reclaim our en-
vironment in our time.

(My faith is based upon the
fresh hope that IT see in the
faces of the students who
stop here for four years, and
the continuing hope that I
know resides in the breasts
of those who administer and
teach at this institution.

But who can compute what
the word loses in tht multi-
tude of promising intellects
combined with timid charac-
ters (Davidson students?),

who dare not follow out any’*

bold, vigorous, independent
train of thought, lest it
should land them in some-

thing which could be consid- —

ered unsafe? :
And are they taught by
men (Davidson faculty?) of
deep conscientiousness, and
refined understanding, who

spend their lifetimes in so-
phisticating with intellects
“which they cannot silence,
and exhaust.,the resources of
ingenuity
reconcile the promptings of
their conscience and reason
with orthodoxy?

2. Does any one of us rec-
ognize what is required of
us in the work of creating
an atmosphere of respect for
learning and discourse and
action at Davidson?

One of*the great strengths
of this College is the diver-
sity of opinions and back-
grounds found here. ‘(Admit-
tedly, there could be more,)

It makes dialogue possible.
It should encourage us,.in
John Stuart Mill’s words, ‘‘to
consider one’s opponents as
one’s allies, as people climb-
ing the hill on the other
side.’’

But it réquires good will
on the part of all, the defeat
of suspicions through over-
tures, équal attention to pub-
lic and private morality, a
disdain for power plays, the
cherishing of democratic
processes by old and young
and, paradoxically, the rec-
ognition of the heed for lead-
ership and responsible au-
thority.

So it seems) delayed its first meeting

By delaying the first meeting un-

that body surely will need, ample
time to consider the main issues of

The issues do press us in spite
of the spirit of leisure which seems
to surround the schedule of the com-

of governmen for all at Davidson is
critical.

Therefore we urge this committee
to get on with the business at hand
and to propose as soon as possible
after meetings are begun some real
solutions to Davidson’s government
problems.

Annoys Redding

To the Editor:

There has been much de-
bate in the last several years
concerning the _ . eighteen-
year-old vote. Apparently
those against this reform
have visited the verbal bat-
tles between East and Can-
non—the freshman dorms.

These" attacks, constantly
lead by the same verbose
and obese Davidson students
usually begin after 11 p.m.
This is when the studious
students are beginning to go
to bed and the ‘‘cool guys”
are beginning to show the

(THE SECRETOF MANS STRENSTH

Unable to maturely cope
with the beer and the free-
dom afforded them at David-
son campus, they _ begin
showing their ‘‘manliness”’
by shouting a fifteen minute
dissertation of four letter
words.

Although humorous at first,
this action becomes rather
monotonous after a few min-
utes and can be extremely
annoying when trying to get
some sleep. e

These “fine’’ Davidson stu-
dents usually succeed in
disrupting the whole ‘eve-
ning and are creating a gap
within the freshman class—
a real benefit to this insti-
tution!

One might argue that the
majority of eighteen-year-
olds should not be kept from
voting because of an ‘mma-
ture few.

This might be so if it
weren't ‘for the fact that
those capable of voting are-
n't allowed sufficient rest to
think clearly. A mature vote
requires clear thinking.

Thomas Redding ‘74
Davidson College

We must love Justice more
than we hate injustice, or at
\/least we must try. \
We must destroy the power
of the dead letter’ over the
living deed.
| know of administration
officials who have given of
themselves for years toward
the goal of defining and
bending rules to student ad-
vantage, |
Yet, when they say ‘‘no”
to a student demand, they
are dealt with derisively.
| know of a senior—of out-
standing qualities—who con-
tributed much to Davidson;
yet, he left embittered over
a single incident in his last
term.

Why do we let these things
happen? Is it because ‘we
don’t work hard enough to
build a community of trust?

On the other hand, | know
the genuine joy that profes-
sors felt in meeting seniors’
Parents at the President’s
reception, and the pangs of
parting with some of the best
men one will ever know.

I know of students, still
here, who already are help-
ing to cr@ate a better life fom
others. —

Why? Because many are
committed to building a
community that will set Da-
vidson apart as a_ special
place. :

A by-product of looking for
better ways of living to-
gether will be'a new civili-
zation.

3. Do we know what is the
responsible .role for the aca-
demic community in society
at large? Somehow we have
to work at restoring the faith
of America in her institutions
of higher education; for we
do bear part of the respon-
sibility for the anti-intellec-
tualism that is rampant in
the land today.

It seems to me that part»
of the answer lies in con-
vincing “the real major’ty"
that at Davidson we are
committed to the pursuit of
the public interest—not as
seme kind of pre-existing
platonic idea but, rather,
that which emetges out. of
differences of opinion, rea-
sonably propounded.

We must not let a revolu-.

tion in lifestyles or the cur-
rent revolution in politics
undermine our rightful func-
tion of critically examining
society and government.

4. Finally, to achieve this
sense of common purpose
would argue—Davidson as an
institution must set about to
re-examine and shape up its
morai-religious commitment
in our time.

John Gardner has express-
ed the ideal so well: “The
idea of individual ° fulfill-
ment within a framework of
moral purpose must become
our deepest concern. . . our
passion, our obsession.’

Freedom without moral
commitment is aimless and
promptly self-destructive.

It is my earnest hope that
my colleagues and fellow
students will vigourously
argue with me over the ideas
presented here.

search of), I would like to
mention one literary gem
that was especially irksome;
the reference is to Rowland’s
remark that ‘Slick Sam"
hadn't had enough time “to
make an ass of himself.”

Obviously Rowland’s only
“perception’’ was in discov-
ering a way to achive the
metamorphosis he prognos-
ticated for Samuel R. Spen-
cer, Jr. in a shorter time
than he thought possible for
the -president.

In an issue of the paper
which contained the editor’s
own comments about the
need for increasing dialogue
and understanding between
trustees, students, faculty
and admini&tration, these
sorts of ad hominem state-
ments are intolerable.

No admin‘strator should
have to begin an academic
year with that sort of innuen-
do preceeding him into what-
ever contact situations he
may be seeking with stu-

, dents,

An@.how can dialogue be-
gin when the, intellectual
level of discussion has been
reduced to name-calling?

Before anyone should get
the wrong idea I must hasten
to point out that I myself
am not necessarily support-
ing the actions of Dr. Spen-
cer and other members of
the faculty or administra
tion, for that matter.

I prefer to wait for those
actions to occur before tak-
ing my stand (a practice Mr.

pa BENE:

Convocation Notations

Rowland wants to = avoid,
perhaps on the grounds of
his clearer ‘‘perception” of
the matter.)

Some. may remember,
however, that at least once
in the past I have put into
print criticism of Spencer on
the matter of his statements
concerning the continuing
college community.

My point is that one does
not have to agree with
everything a man says or
does to give him the benefit
of the doubt at least some
of the time.

We are living in the Aye
of Agnew and are likely to
be reading many more pieces
containing the sort of slight
of which Paul has _ been
guilty. ;

This calls for likewise in-
creasing responsible news-
papermanship, and last
week's editorial aobut the
purpose of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN was a step in the right
direction. :

I am also interested in
seeing some hell raised from
time to time, and I laughed
with everybody else when [

grammatic labeling.
A little reflection, how-

ever, will point out that no

This week’s Convocation bringsto mind a me-

lange of thoughts which,. although
*-flect on this school and the society which surrounds

disconnected, re-

it. Herewith a few for your consideration:

1. It is fortunate that the Convocation already
existed as an idea in the mind of Samvel Spencer,
else the Educational Policy Committee, Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee, Ad Hoc Committee of Concern-
ed and/or Committed Students, the Ladies’ Bible
Class of the Concord Presbyterian Church, or, one of
the remaining scores of august bodies withou?’ which

’ this school would not be wh

to invent one.

at is it, would have had

_ For sparing us that arduous process, and, more
importantly, for adding a valuable event to the col-
lege calendar, thank you Dr. Spencer.

2. The pagentry of the Convocation ceremony
says more about the idea of “community” than all
of the hot air which is now being expanded on that

sub
student polls.

ect in the rhetoric of the current generation of

The trappings of a format academic ceremony
are more than just showpieces or indicators of posi-
tion in the academic Great Chain of Being; they are
representative of membership.in a community which
transcends time “and place, defining itself through
the common quest of its members for understanding,
if not Truth;:the community of scholars.

As indicated by

the regalia, the search has been

going on in the universities since the Middle Ages,
with new discovery opening the door to further in-

vestigation.

In this light, it is hard to see how the ‘ceremony

could fail to evoke a sense of humility afid awe in
the inheritors of that tradition. College “governance,” —
codes of conduct, curriculum and admifiistration are
certainly thelegitimate concern of the members of
the academic community at Davidson, but unless
the community concerns itself first with the goals
represented by the cap and gowns, it denies ‘its pri-
mary raison d’etre, making the rest meaningless.

3. Presentation of the Thomas Jefferson and
Alumni Association awards was an important part
of the ceremony, for it underlined the best side of

.the university tradition: excellence in teaching and

scholarship.

The present curriculum is in no way sacrosanct,
yet the personal qualities encouraged by the awards
will always be necessary for the fulfillment. of this
college’s academic ‘goals.

“The reforms now contemplated may revitalize
Davidson, but, they will never ovate: the need
for sacrifice,,diligence and enthusiasm in the pursuit
of knowledge.

4. The tremendous response of everyone present
to Ivan Allen, former Mayor of Atlanta, tities
Rouse, builder of the new city of Columbia, Mary-
land, was a result neither of their abilities as public
speakers, nor the presence of “charisma” in either,
but because both have succeeded in confronting the
problems of urban life in a time when the outlook
in that area is gloomy, at best. ;

Allen and Rouse were well received because they
have made optimum use of the institutions of gov-

~ernment and the free market in the betterment of the

ee environment, and because they have succeed-
ed. i

What this country needs, as evidenced } by the
achievement of these two men, is leadership which
is concernéd less with its image and more with mak-
ing its programs work. :
