RECORD HOLDER

Jimmy Downey may well hold
the record for distance traveled.
In the mere 30 days he held the
keys to coolness, Downey made
trips to Canada (by way of New
York), Washington, D, C., Flor-
ida. and South Carolina (fre-
quently).

His total bill—to be reimburs-
ed by the company—was in ex-
cess of $150. ‘Just call me S.

receiving the car.

Kernodle and Bill Jacobs drove
to Miami, left their cars and
made the jump over to Nassau.
The former pointed out that this
four days inactivity cut into his
total miles traveled.

one else is paying your fuel bill,
it makes getting out almost a

‘Student Action Draws '
Honor Court Warning

STOKES

Honor Court Chairman

Since spring vacation the Honor Court has be-
come concerned over several alleged or actual ac-
tions of some Davidson students. Stones have been
thrown at trains passing by Hattie’s on several occa-

sions.

Davidson students are suspected of these of-

of noise in and around the

Spread.
Both of these are not

fenses and a railroad detective has been called in to
investigate. If any students have been involved, it
would be very wise to desist from such actions.

A second cause of concern has been the increase

dormitories. In particular,

the exploding of fireworks and the playing of hi-fi’s,
stereos and radios too loudly has become wide-

only violations of the Stu-

dent Body Regulations but are also in violation of
any rules of considerate and thoughtful conduct. 1

hope this reminder will make any further recom.
mendations or warnings about such practice unnec-

essary.

RAIN OR SHINE FOR 30 YEARS |

Polley Makes, Peddles

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

Of the great number of
Davidson students who pass
by C. R. Polley at least twice
a week, very few, if any,
know who he is. He’s a sight
as familiar as Hattie’s—but
who is he?

C. R. Polley is none other than.
Route 21's very own. ‘cherry ci-
der man.” Rain or shine for the
past 30 years Polley has sold his
cider from Albany, N, Y, to
Charlotte. He originally comes
from Pennsylvania which he left
because the ‘“‘winters up there
are hell.”

While working in Albany Pol-
ley once appeared in an article
in Colllers on the New York
countryside. ‘I was in there
with my cider with a big color
picture.”

After Polley moved to Char-
lotte, he worked on South 21 for
a couple of years. Here he again
made the big time with an ar-
ticle in the Observer (‘It gave
me a hell of a write-up.’’) fea-
turing him and his cider, Final-
ly he moved to his present loca-
tion, even though 21 south was
a busier location, to get away
from the rapidly expanding sub-
urbs.

Polley buys his cherries in the

Winter and presses them in an
apple press in his home. He
buys the bottles from Coca-Cola
and puts up enough cider to last
for the rest of the year, then he
‘thits the road‘’.once again. He
is in the same spot seven days
a week, nearly all year: “I been
out here on some cold days and
some damn hot ones too.”

According to Polley it's not an
easy living~sitting and selling.
He's on location early in the
morning and guits around 6 p.m,
—all to sell 30-40 gallons a week,
At $1.35 a gallon, that doesn’t
put him in the 90 per cent tax
bracket, but at least he's his
own boss. Right now. though,
he's worried about Route 77 re-
placing 21 and driving him some.
where else even less traveled.

When asked if a lot of David.
son boys stopped in to buy, he
replied that they did all the
time; in fact, ‘Four gals. from
Davidson stopped by here this
morning—raisin’ hell."

Next to Davidson girls, tour-

As long as they all want cider,
there’s not much difference
among them, but ‘A Northerner
will spend quicker than a South-
erner—I'Nl tell you that. They'll
ask more questions and kick
more about the price, but they')l

usually take it."
One reason is that Northern-
ers are away from home and
are ready to spend money on
things they usually wouldn't. An-
other reason, he claims, is the
water down South. “They (the
tourists) get down South and
they get that damn mineral wa-
ter—tastes like rotten eggs."
Even Southerners are kind of
peculiar, asserted Polley with a
chuckle, especially, “those ones
from South Carolina. You know,
they ask ‘What's it made of?’
What the hell they think it's
made of? They even ask what
it’s good for.’ There was in-
credulity in his eyes as he
thought on how stupid people
are, ‘Hell, I tell ‘em it's good

to.
The cider’s best: when it’s
chilled, but if you put sugar in

.it and leave it for a couple of

weeks you'll get a good batch
of cherry wine. He added that
it's also good for using as a
mixer with gin or vodka.

Suddenly acquiring a passion
for cherry cider, we decided to
purchase a gallon. As he handed
it to us he advised “If you put
some in that bottle there, you'll
never finish that story you're
gonna write.”

Thanking him for the advice,
we told him goodbye, bottle in
hand and full of visions of Spring
Frolics and cider. He told us to
come again soon and climbed
back into his car to wait for
another customer to come along.

Being an Army officer is a challenge. Officers must be
leaders... able to take responsibility ... get impor-
tant jobsdone. * ™.. ' e

It isn’t easy to win a commission as an Army
officer. But if you are taking the Basic Course in
ROTC you're well on your way—provided you can
measure up to the high standards required for admis-
sion to the Advanced Course.

As a student in one of the 247 colleges and univer-
sities offering senior ROTC training, you are in a
privileged group. There’s no better way for any
college man to get the training and skills needed to
be an Army officer than through the on-campus pro-
gram created specifically for that purpose—ROTC.

Here you learn to be a leader... to develop the

from Davidson.

Richardson Scholar Fred Ehl-
ers acted as spokesman for the
PRAM plan, saying that the
$2400 would practically com-
plete his drive for the $10,000
needed.

Ehlers described this experi-
ment in international relations
as an effort to send ‘students,
not machines, ideas, not mon-
ey.’ to a country which was
more than just ‘Indians and
shrunken heads.”*

Mrs. William P. Cumming en-

training .. . qualities that will pay off for the rest of

» There are other advantages too. Pay, at the rate
of $40 per month during the Advanced Course plus
allowances for summer training and travel. Fellow-

modern Army equipment, and perhaps to qualify for
Army flight training if it is offered at your school. And
then gold bars and a commission as an Army officer.

now. Let him know you're interested in signing up
for the Advanced Course. Then if you are offered an
opportunity to join, don’t pass it up. It’s the program
that’s best for you...and best for your country.
