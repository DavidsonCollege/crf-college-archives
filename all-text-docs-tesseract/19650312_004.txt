Rule Concentrates Talk
On Philosophy Of Sex

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Sex—this time as seen by Dr.
John P. Rule. former dean of
students at MIT—was the topic
of last Tuesday's chapel.

This continuation of the
YMCA forum on Sex and
Ethics was widely anticipated
by the student body especially
in view of the Ethel Nash
experience.

But those who expected more

. Shouting from the audience
were disappointed. Unlike Dr.
Nash, Rule, a well-known auth-
ority on student-administration
relations, restricted himself to
a factual description of trends
in the sex ethics of today’s
college students. He also dis-
cussed some of the effects of
these trends on studen:s’ indiv-
idually and as a group.

S:udents of ioday ‘‘question
the validity of our society's
restrictions on premarital sex, '
according to Rule: “Adults
should recognize the sincerity
of most young people,” who

are trying to work out ‘values
to which they can honestly
hold.

This moral re-evaluation i

RULE DISCUSSES

largely due to search for be-
longing at a time in the life

of the individual and at a
point in history when the se-
curity offered by the family
is steadily decreasing. The
groups which take the place
of the family may be more
dictatorial with respect to sex
practices.

Indiv.dual decision on the
issue is made harder by its
emotional explosiveness.

However, Rule contends,
“Everyone must and should
determine for himself what his
attitudes toward sex are going
to be.’

Giving college students credit
for ingenuity, Rule commented
that “sex expression takes many
forms.” In general, though, any
expression which reflects a
“spiritual communion” between
the persons involved is con-
sidered good by young people
today. Those which do not ex-
press such communion are bad.

By way of recognition of
some problems inherent in such
a view, Rule said. ‘Such an
ethic is open to a great deal,
of rationalization.’’. Rule closed |

Summer Esrollment —
To Pass 200 Mark

Over 200 students are expec:-
ed to enrol! in Davidson's
summer session beginning June
17, according to Frontis John-
ston, dean of faculty and dir-
ector of the summer school.

Johnston attributed the steady
decline in numbers over the
past 10 years to the higher
quality of student who no longer
needs to attend.

This year's school will con-
sist of three 3-week sessions,
each equivalent to a semester's
work: The three sessions will
run from June 17 to July 10,
July 12 to August 3, and August
5 to August 21.

Students will attend classes
five days a week, or six days
if taking a science. There will
‘be three 75 minute periods a
day. The tentative schedule is:
8:05 to 9:20, first period; 9:20
to 10:35, second period; 10:35
to 11:15, chapel; and, 11:15 to
12:30, third period.

As in past years, only a lim-
ited number of courses will be
offered, Johnston said. During
the first wo sessions, the college

will offer 18 to 20 courses nang:
ing from biology and physics
to English 21 and the langu-
ages.

However, freshman Bible
and English will not be of-
fered this summer. Only 6-10 |
courses will be offered during
the third session, with sciences
being omitted entirely.

Students attending a session
will stay on campus and will
be required to eat at the
Union. The tuition will be $23
or $30 per semester hour, mak-
ing the complete cost about
$150 for a three-hour course.

For the first time, the col-
lege will recommend that in-
coming freshmen come to
summer school. They will be
asked to take a language in
order to decrease the size of
the language classes in Sep-
tember. Dean Johnston recom-
mends summer school for
everyone, however. “TI think
it is a good chance to get
ahead and lighten the load
for your remaining years.’

COLEMAN

A Memphis, Tenn. junior,
Woody Coleman served as
Quips and Cranks honorar-
ies editor for the past year.
An SAE, Coleman is a mem-
ber of APO service fratern-
ity and of the Business-Eco-

: nomies Association.

The purpose of Quips and
Cranks is to present the Da-
vidson experience as accurate-
ly and vividly as possible. In
order to do this I would actively
recruit tke most creative minds
on campus to help in sensing
and expressing this experience.

In unifying and channeling the
three main parts of the year-
book (copy, theme, and pictures)
toward this goal, I would exer-
cise care to avoid allowing any
of the three to exist for its own
sake. Copy in particular would

be directed toward the expres-
sion of Davidson life rather

sary. Certain groups must not
close themselves off from soci-

serious rebellion in moral at-

Haselden Presents Minorit

MINORITY REPORT

The Fraternity Evaluation
Committee has met and dis-
cussed at length the fratern-
ity situation at Davidson
College in an effort to ans-
wer this basic question:
“Are the fraternities serv-
ing the needs of Davidson
College and its studerts,
and are there specific steps
that might be taken to bet-
ter serve these needs?”

While I do not agree in
total with the other reports
in answer to this question,
there may be some agree-
ment between some of my
points and those issued by
the other members of the
committee.

As a minority I agree that
there are certain things wrong
with the fraternity system, but
I do not agree that the fraterni-
ties are the entire cause of the
problems that exist on this
campus, nor are they to share
the full blame. It is with this
in mind that I make the follow-
ing proposals and suggestions,
along with pertinent remarks.

1. Maintain the Present Fratern-
ity System.

A. Maintain the present fratern-
ity rush system (first week of
first semester) because

1. Provides immediately
for the existing needs of in-
coming freshmen, both so-
cially and academically, i.e.,
maintain average, provides
study halls, provides tutors,
social outlet.

2. Allows for greater di-
versification within the
Greek letter fraternities
which enables individuals to
pursue fields of scholarship,
athletics, social, ete. within
&@ common goal.

3. Enables a greater num-
ber of people to participate
in rush and keeps fraterni-
ties from so called typing.
(Dr. Rule of MIT stated that

In order to increase the num-
ber of pages and the budget
for photography, particularly
color, I would increase efforts
to expand advertising.

Finally, the annual needs to
give more emphasis to the un-
organized activities of students
—the things other than clubs,
meetings, and classes—that are
such an important part of our
life at Davidson. With such
changes Quips and Cranks can
better fulfill its purpose of pre-
seming the experience of the
student.

Chevrolet Lends Cars
To Davidson Students

ing Chevrolet against charges
of publicity seeking, Burts said
that Chevrolet intended to keep
the use of a car a secret until
a banquet at which the 15 stu-
dents were simply to express
their opinions of automobiles in
general. But an information leak
occurred in the college's pre-
paration for the program.
Thé students will receive their
new Impala Super Sports at a

banquet on March 18 in the:

Union's Wildcat Room.
Two of the original 15 seniors

were unable to obtain parental |
consent. Burts and Smith have |
selected Harold Kernodle and:

Jim Downey as replacements.

MIT had the same system
of rush as we do and that
the school endorsed the fra-
ternity system because of
this (rush before school be-
gins) and the scholastic as-
pect of the fraternities.
There is a direct correlation,
he said, between MIT and
Davidson in that both have
shown the fraternity aver-
ages to be higher than the
all-men’s-average.)

4. As a side note, it may
even be advantageous to put
rush entirely before classes
start to keep it out of the
academic year entirely.
This could mean that only
those freshmen who want
to participate in rush would
come to school early. Orien-
tation week could follow the
rush week, for example, and
thus de-emphasize fraterni-
ties.

B. General Points for Maintain-
ing the Present System:

1. National fraternities pro-
vide incentive for and dis-
ciplinary contro! of their re-
spective fraternities with
regard to social probation,
academic probation, scholar-
ship requirements, _ etc.
Though admittedly not per-
fect, national controls are
better influence than admin-
istrative controls over the
local clubs would be.

2. Fraternity loyalty be-
comes college ioyalty when
a student becomes an alum-
nus, i.e., from the 1963 issue
of “The Rattle’ of Theta
Chi brought out by the In-
terfraternity Research and
Advisory Council Bulletin
comes this note:

“By reason of a grant
from the Carnegie Founda-
tion, George F. Baughman,
Vice President and Treasur-
er of New York University,

QUIPS AND CRANKS
SNIDER

Arnie Snider, a Salisbury
junior, has served as Quips
and Cranks fraternities edi-
tor this year and sports edi-
tor last year. Snider is a
member of Pi Kappa Alpha
and has served on the Stu-
dent Council for the past
two years.

Quips & Cranks is unique be-
cause it is comparable in size
to annuals of schools which have
a much larger student body and
a wider rang of extracurricul-
ars.

Because of its size then, Quips
and Cranks feaves room for
creativity which is lacking or
minimized in many university
annuals. I propose to take ad-
vantage of this opportunity for
creativity by adding staff mem-
bers who would work exclusively
on getting high quality, informal
pictures, as well as exceptional
color pictures.

The annual Is not the place
to criticize or editorialize. It
is the lasting publication por-
traying life at Davidson and it
should capture the best of every
aspects of campus life. Along
that same line I feel that the
copy which sets the tone of the
yearbook should include certain-
ly some of the problems drudg-
ery, etc. of the student, but
should not emphasize this to the
exclusion of the more positive
and agreeable aspects of the
‘Davidson experience.”’

The editor should take ad-
vantage of the originality of his
staff members. I propose to
allow staff members a good
deal of freedom in their re-
spective sections, for I feel that
the editor should organize, di-
rect, and coordinate, but should
not have to personally decide all
questions that arise.

This platform is very general
primarily because it is hard at
this time to tell you anything
about next year’s annual that
would not be subject to change.
Similarly I can neither agree

nor disagree with the changes
made in this year’s book which
is yet to be distributed or dis-
cussed.

I base my candidacy on two
years of previous work on
Quips & Cranks as Sports Edi-
tor last year and as Fraterni-
ties Editor this year. In ad-
dition to work on Quips &
Cranks I acted as co-editor of
the yearbook in high school.

From this experience I feel
I have gained at least a work-
able knowledge of yearbook pro-
cedures and I hope you will give
me the opportunity to apply this
experience.

the national level. Shortly
afterward 28 executive sec-
retaries of leading national
fraternities met -with him.
He pointed out that New
York University had con-
cluded that building a strong
fraternity system was the
most logical thing to do in
order to develop a feeling of
lasting loyalty to the univer-
sity and at the same time
develop more of a residen-
tial undergraduate student
body. The desirability of this
‘was pointed out because the
fraternity membership at
N.Y.U., consisting of only
4% of the total alumni body,
nevertheless, has been re-
sponsible for 36% of the an-
nual Alumni Gift.’

While this does not per-
tain to Davidson College per
se, I feel that it warrants
considerable correlation.

3. Student morale is an
undeniable force which in-
fluences all phases—aca-
demic, athletic, intellectual,
social—of a college’s life.
Morale is a product of the
students themselves and
while it can be influenced
by an administration, it is
something that must come
from within the student body
itself.

Davidson College, by vir-
tue of location, nature, and
male composition, quite un-
avoidably provides certain
obstacles to the quality of
student morale. Yet I feel
that the fraternity system
deserves a large share of
credit for the good morale
of men that form the welded
unity which pervades all
phases of student life.

By virtue of location and
all-male composition the col-
lege itself cannot easily pro-
vide men with adequate so-
cial outlets. Because of its
size the college cannot pro-

The Quips and Cranks. We
take a passing interest in the
election of its editor every
Spring: we rush to get our
copy in May, to see how un-
photogenic we are; we may
read it from cgver to cover
once,remarking about an oc-
easional good picture. And then
we lay it to rest on a dusty
shelf, referring to it again only
to see if so-and-so is who we
thought he was.

What, then, makes Quips and
Cranks good or bad? Very simp-
ly, there are only two ingredi-
ents: photographs and copy. If
both are imaginative and
thoughtful and sensitive, artis-
tic layout can arrange them
into a meaningful whole. There
need be no frills or gimmicks;
its singular theme is the David-
son student and his life at this
college.

Composite pictures and posed
photographs, which depict our
formal scholastic, extra-curri-
cular and athletic lives, are not
the essence of a yearbbook, de-
spite the fact that they occupy
much of its space. What makes
a yearbook memorable is the
extent to which its photograph-
ers have captured us, as David-
son students, and recorded our
moments of pleasure and pain,
victory and defeat, light and
darkness.

The camera's eye must be
where we play the role of Stu-
dent—be it at Hattie’s or ves-
pers, after-dance parties or
Chambers. Such pictures may be
humorous or depressing or
simply beautiful; in any case,
their sole function is to offer
the memory a moment of realis-
tic recognition.

A picture may be worth a
thousand words, but, without
words, ‘a picture isn’t worth the
time it takes to look at it. This
is especially true in the Quips
and Cranks. Words, or copy,
are essential: if written by a
sensitive and obseryant mind,
they form the thread which sews
the garment together. By
“copy’’ I do not mean mere
news-reporting, but meaning-
ful and thoughtful prose—poetry,
if you will, that is simple and
direct and that speaks to and
about us, the Davidson student.

vide constant or sufficient
opportunities for students to

satisfy non-academic inter-
ests or needs. The system
does provide for satisfaction
of social and other non-
_ academic needs for a large
majority of the college's
men. It provides for the ex-
pression of leadership and
a sense of participation for
many men who would other-
wise be denied this outlet.
though admittedly not on a
grand scale, it also pro-
vides transportation and
communication for other
non-academic intereste.

Most important, the exist-
ing fraternity system pro-
vides real communication
within the student body. Men
of similar but not identical
ideals grouped together of-
fer an opportunity for ex-
pression and communication
that would otherwise be im-
possible.

1. While the above stated ideas
are in support of the present
system, without change, there
are certain undeniable evils
within the system, Thus, in
order to correct these in some
way, the following are proposed
solutions to help the present
situations: That

1, A campus-wide social
committee be set up to plan
and carry out all major so-
cial functions for the entire
student body, and a fixed so-
cial fee be charged to all
students and that the funds
from this fee be allocated
to the campus-wide social
committee and College Union
for the financing of social
activities and entertainment.
(This has already received
unanimous approval of the
committee). (This would re-
move.some of the social in-
fluence of the fraternity sys-
tem and cause fraternities
to justify their existence.))

: Platforms For Magazine, Annual Editors

SCRIPTS 'N PRANKS

VICK

Charlie Vick, a sopho-
more from Atlanta, Ga.,
served as Pranks editor ‘of
Scripts ‘n Pranks this year.
As a freshman, he served
as staff writer. A philoso-
phy major, Vick is a mem-
ber of Sigma Upsilon writ-
ing fraternity.

The S‘nP began as a campus
magazine. It included humor,
poetry and prose pieces of a
more serious nature. There is
‘a current trend toward the
completely humorous maga-
zine. I am all for a humor
magazine. However, in the last
series of issues the humor was
either poor, stolen or esoteric.
There must be some way to
give the magazine more sub-
stance, better humor and broad-
er appeal.

The reaction to the current,
completely humorous, magazine
by visitors to the campus, stu-
dents and faculty seems to be
one of pity rather than of inter-
est or laughter. For a platform
the best I can do is list some
ideas I have been working on
and discussing with students,
faculty and publishers.

The format would be changed,
including a smaller page size
book paper (like the College
Catalogue), a pictorial insert,
a standard cover, and a length
increase to the fifty page range.
The spectrum of articles would
include humor of a_ hopefully
higher quality, short stories,
poems and other factity or
non-student contributions. The
organizational aspect, now vir-
tually non-existent, would be
defined and functional.

In place of the present ‘“‘sys-
tem" there would be an editor-
ial advisory board with regu-
lar meetings including both stu-
dents and faculty. The staff
would receive definite rather
than haphazard assignments.
The magazine would still be the
students’ publication, yet ad-
ditional material and creative
thinking would most certainly
add to the magazine's quality
and, therefore, reputation.

Humor would, of course, be a
part of the S’nP yet the quality
of the humor must improve.
Other student writings and arti-
cles of interest should be in-
cluded as the past issues have
shown the completely humor-
ous leaflet concept fo be lack:
ing. Ches R. Cat, the croquet
match and that other S’nP joke,
the magazine itself. seem rath-
er unfeasible, but a larger more
diversified S’nP perhaps de-
serves a try.

2. No summer rush of any
type will be allowed. This
includes all correspondence
from fraternity men in offi-
cial positions, fraternity rush
parties, and fraternity pub-
lications prior to a fresh-
man's entrance in Septem-
ber. The I.F.C. would be re-
sponsible for informing the
incoming men of the system
and the school orientation
would further explain this,
with pros and cons (In this
way fraternities can be de-
emphasized in the eyes of
freshmen).

3. Allow for expanded Un-
ion facilities to make a bet-
ter place for those who are
not members of the Greek
system, i.e., more T.V.'s,
card rooms, etc.

4. Lingle Manor be made
into a campus club with full
facilities for board and s0-
cial orientation. for those
non-fraternity men who wish
to join. (If this ‘eating
club" idea grows, allow for
expanded facilities in the
nature of an additional house
or houses).

5. Allow independents and/
or Lingle Manor to partici-
pate in all campus functions
with fraternities, i.e., home-
coming display, home-com-
ing queen, intramurals, etc.

6. Allow all freshmen who
maintain a 1.5 average to
have cars on campus. (It is
believed that this would pro-
vide a needed asset of trans-
portation to all men, frater-
nity or non-fraternity, for
group or individual use). It
may also be possible to pur-
chase or rent a bus for stu-
dent use.

7. Maintain a Fraternity
Evaluation Committee with
those members now residing
and will be here next year
plus additional men selected
by the president of the stu-

COMPTON

John Compton, a sopho-
more from _ Riegelwood,
served this year as art edi-
tor of Scripts ‘n Pranks and
as an art contributor last
year. Compton is a member
of Sigma Nu and is cur-
rently serving on the Union
Board.

Each semester Scripts ‘n
Pranks receives the support
of 100 per cent of the student
body by means of an involun-
tary donation. In spite of the
nature of the contribution,
Sn’ P has a responsibility to its
1,000 subscribers which Is de-
fined as providing an outlet for
creative expression and a source
of entertainment.

Scripts ‘n Pranks is a mixture
of many types of expression,
but with what I believe should
be an emphasis on material of
a light and humorous nature. It
has been said of our generation
that we think thoughts serious
beyond our years; but, when we
look back on our college experi-
ences, we like to think of the
lighter side of life and the good
times we have had. These are
the things I would like to por-
tray in the coming year of
Scripts ‘n Pranks.

Among my ideas for changes
are plans for more participation
from the student body, expan-
sion of circulation, stricter
quality requirements, less ab-
straction, and a greater degree
of contact with two elements
of society with which we are
largely out of contact, the op-
posite sex and the outside world.

I am also planning on an extra
issue next year, if present ne-
gotiations with a new printer
work out: This arrangement
would reduce the cost per issue
substantially, and, because of
a different. printing process,
would allow for greater free-
dom of illustration.

In a limited fashion I have
presented my concept of Scripts
‘n Pranks and a few of my ma-
jor plans. I am hoping for your
Support that I may carry them
out in the coming year. Thank-
you.

dent body. This would ena-
ble evaluation and changes
as the cause arises.

CONCLUSION

While these proposed sugges-
tions will not completely elimi-
nate all existing problems, it
will lessen considerably most of
them and enable a social life
for those both in and out of the
system. While no plan is perfect,
the above will enable gradual
changes that are necessary to
develop.

If the need and cause war-
rant, the Fraternity Evaluation
Committee can suggest such
changes that appear necessary.
It is believed that many of the
above will lessen the influence
of the fraternity system and
make college life at Davidson
more beneficial without drastic
change. .

While I have listed only a few
reasons for maintaining the pres-
ent rush system and fraternity
situation, the condition may stil!
warrant a change in this set-up.
I bring to mind only that the
present system serves for at
least 75% of the student body,
and for the school to assume
ihis role, the physical plant at
present would be inadequate and
the changes both long and ex-
pensive.

This is not to say that there
might not be necessary changes,
but that consideration be given
to the thought that until the col-
lege has facilities (T.V.'s, social
parlors, card rooms, easy
chairs, etc.) to accommodate a
change, a change for delayed
rush should be carefully thought
out and problems eliminated be-
fore exposure of students to it.

With all this in mind the pro-
posals made, I feel, will greatly
increase the social enjoyment of
most of the student body, both in
and out of fraternities, and make
life at Davidson College better.

Respectfully,
ED. HASELDEN
