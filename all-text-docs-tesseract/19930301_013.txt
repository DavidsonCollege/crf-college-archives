Whistlin' Dixie ... Matt Bumstead

1993 Top Ten Male Country Singers: Brooks Tops Again

Before I proceed with the 2nd
annual “Whistlin’ Dixie Top Ten
Males,” there are a few stipula-
tions of this ranking that I should
mention.

First, to be in this list you must
becurrently performing (that’s why
Patsy Cline did not land in last
week’s list). Second, to be ranked’
you must also.be very successful
with new albums and singles- to-
day. George Jones will, therefore,
be among the superstars who,
though still living, are not eligible
for this ranking.

Finally, this week’s column is
the toughest of the year to write; it
probably shouldn’t even be done.
There are at least six people who
could arguably landin the top three.
But the 1993 Top Ten is a lot
harder to call (especially since I
am going to try to keep my per-
sonal preference at bay). Well,
here we go...

10. Mark Chesnutt - - A pretty
strong #10, eh? Hits #1’s with

out magically produced albums.
But he’s still not high profile at all
and can’t get much bigger in
today’s media-oriented world un-
til he steps out a little more. For
real country lovers, he ranks a lot
higher.

9. Doug Stone -- Continues to
hang tough. He’s coming to Coy-
ote Joe’s over Spring Break. If you
are here, I highly recommend his
show. AsI said two weeks ago, he

consistency, is great live, and puts .

sells albums and has lots of huge
singles; but his cheesy romantic
demeanor (especially when mixed
with his good-old-boy english)
probably keeps him from being a
big shot.

8. Randy Travis/
Ricky Van Shelton - -

because, upon panicking at his
backsliding popularity, he at-
tempted to modify his image by
getting rid of the hat. A little weak,
Clint.

6. George Strait - - Well, King

hear the critics now. Sure he writes
his own stuff, has the big albums,
the big singles, and the huge (and
dynamite) live shows, but Alan
Jackson does not have what the top
four have in addition to those:

start). Ricky is still doing well, but
he may be falling a little with the
incredible surge by the younger
crowd. Neither has really fallen in
rank; the others have just gotten
bigger.

7. Clint Black - - Again, de-
spite the. perceived fall in rank,
Clint has actually regained mo-
mentum. #7 is way too low for a
superstar like Clint Black, but for
now he just can’t be any higher.
“Burn One Down” (his most re-
cent #1) was a classic Black tune,
arguably his best. Buthe lost points

George hasn’t really fallen (as I
keep saying in all of these), he’s
just been surpassed by some great
performances in 1992. But give
George a gold star for his landing
the starring role in “Pure Country”
(in which he did just fine, thank
you), and for putting out - by way
of the film - another savory piece
of work. George will always be
the country fan’s sentimental fa-
vorite.

5. Alan Jackson --It getseven
harder now. Whew. “Alan Jack-
son at #5? Are you crazy?” Ican

he was getting a divorce - “Here’s
a Quarter." If he can just keep his
mouth shut about Billy Ray Cyrus,
he might make it higher next year.

3. Vince Gill - - Vince has
surpassed the challengers. Hemay
not be the most country-sounding
guy; you justdon’thearatenor like
him every day. But here’s what he
is: six CMA’s (two for best male
vocalist, two for songwriting), two
Grammys, and the title of best all
around person in the.country mu-
sic world. He is loved by all, and
that makes his deserved victories

all the sweeter. He is also one of
the very best instrumentalists in
the country spotlight.

2. Billy (shiver) Ray (gag)
Cyrus - - Oh, he’s just great. The
only member of the top five who
can’t write songs (the verdict is out
on whether or not he can write).
You know how I feel on this one.
All I can say is this: biggest debut
album of any format in the history
of music; somewhere around 8 mil-
lion copies sold; a CMA his first
time out and a Grammy nomina-
tion for Best Record. He could not
be denied the #2 spot . ..no matter
how hard I tried.

1. Garth Brooks - - But thank
the Lord that there is still the
Garthmeister. We’ll see if Billy
Ray can stick around and sell al-
most thirty million copies of five
albums as Garth has (so far). Sing-
ing, songwriting, and performing -
he does it all like no other. He
owns number one - on the radio, in
the record stores, in the media, in
the bookstores, and, of course, in
the auditoriums. No single person
can ever match what Garth Brooks
has done in and for country music.
Andallat just over thirty years old.

Well, there it is, the 1993 edi-
tion of the Whistlin’ Dixie Top
Ten. Although my top ten prob-
ably doesn’t match yours, you gotta
like all these artists for putting out
some outstanding products. It’s
been quite a year.

School, a boarding school that re-
cently became coed. He believes

that_most of the men “‘were_not.

conscious of any sexism or chau-
vinism that [they] manifested at
that time, in light of whatis known
now.” He recalls his freshman
year as a series of broadcasted ste-
reomessagesacross dorms to girls,
major water fights, and caravans

of streakers. “I remember the
women as being more mature than
we were. They were also indepen-
dent, self-confident, and extremely
bright."

Although the standard of ad-
mission to Davidson in 1973 was
higher for women than for men,
many of the new females felt that
some of the faculty made the tran-
sition more difficult for the school.
Bumgarner believes that “some of

the faculty seemed to have reser-
vationsat first.” Elizabeth Simpson
disagrees. “I never felt that I had
any problems with the faculty to
feelincluded.” According to Jonas,
“Some professors were reluctant
to help us fit in, but overall we
proved that we deserved to be
there.” Despite the initial prob-
lems, the women of the class of
1977 are generally happy with their
decision to go to Davidson. Ac-

cording to Andrews, “It’s given
me alotof pride and pleasure to be
a member of that class.”
-Bumgarneragrees. She says, “Af-
ter twenty years, I can say I made
the right decision.” Most of the
women agree that the males also
struggled ‘with the transition to
coeducation. Although Andrews
notes that there was a lot of atten-
tion taken away from men and
given to women, Mark Armstrong

believes that the men were excited
about women joining them at
Davidson. “Ialways thought about
how difficult it was for the women
with 1100 men hanging around
them all of the time.”

Laurie Bumgarner’shusband,,
Kenneth (class of 1976), agrees.
“In general, men were very happy
that women showed up.” Laurie

- laughs at this, and says, “Well, we

stifled some of their perversion.”

Once, however, she met the
bite of faculty conservatism. Upon
finding her quarter grade in one
Classto bea ‘B’ when she knew she
had clearly earned an ‘A’, she con-
fronted the professor. He admitted
plainly that yes, she had earned the
higher ‘grade, but that he simply.
“didn’t give ‘A’s to girls.”

Shortly thereafter, in 1956,
Davidson hired its first female fac-
ulty member, Dr. Carolyn
MacBrayer. She had taught psy-
chology at Queens College. Ather
first faculty meeting, an old bottle
found during the restoration of
Eumenean Hall was exhibited to
the faculty. One professor “was
ieard to remark that he never ex-
pected to live long enough to see
the day when, at a Davidson Col-
lege faculty meeting, there should
be a whiskey bottle at one end of
the table anda womanat the other.”

Attitudes concerning women

floodgates had been opened with
the election of Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. to the College presidency. Dr.

Spencer pushed for rigorous self-

examination of the entire structure
of Davidson, an@established advi-
sory commissions on issues in-
cluding coeducation. They rec-
ommended in May, 1969, that
Davidson “‘become coeducational
at the earliest appropriate time...”
The faculty soon decided to accept
thirty female students for the next
year under a Student Exchange
Program with eight other schools
including Agnes Scott, Winthrop,
Randolph-Macon, and others.
These women dormed across main
street in the Grey House, now the
Admissions Building.

The Trustees moved in 1971 °
to accept wives of students, and the
wives and daughters of faculty and
staff members, as students work-
ing toward actual degrees. The
nextyear, the faculty recommended

‘coeducation at Davidsonas “‘desir-

able and feasible” and “impera-

Ob tte Sc waht

tive.” The vote stood at sixty to
six, and by May 1972 the Trustees
accepted the recommendation. The
first full-fledged female students
arrived the next year.

According to historian Mary
Beaty, applications had declined
in years previous to coeducation,
but the number reached record
highs within two years after the
Trustees voted for it.

By 1977, the school was well
onits way to having one third of its
student body female, and later that
percentage was raised by the trust-
ees to 45%.

Now, women have equal sta-
tus as students and community
members at Davidson, with the
exception of having their own fra-
ternities. Women have proven to
beample students and campus lead-
ers, having claimed valedictory,
Rhodes Scholar, and SGA honors,
and have filled many positions in
the faculty. They didn’t faint, col-

lapse, become invalids, or melt as _

the editorialist of 1888 would have

had us believe; no, in fact they
have held up quite well.

the late Mary D. Beaty’s A History
of Davidson College, and from in-
terviews with Lura Owen, wife of
