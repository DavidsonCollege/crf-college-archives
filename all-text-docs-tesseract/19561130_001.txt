IN HUMANITIES FIELDS

Reigner Donates $1500
To Library Book Fund

Ch
‘Action For Hungary’ «ally Set ror
Wednesday; 1 wo.-a‘triots To Speak

Dr. Charles G. Reigner, President of the H. M. Rowe Com-
pany of Baltimore, Md., has given the Library $1500 this year.

Yearly since 1950 he has pre-
sented the library with $500 to buy
large numbers of books in the
general field of Humanities with
no strings attached, and this year
he has added an extra $1000.

As Dr. Reigner has a special in-
terest in candidates for the Presby-
terian ministry, a large ‘portion of
funds have been used for pur-
chases with that in mind. The books
comprise “The Charles G. Reigner
Collection.” The Reigner Seminar
in the Davidson College Library is
also named for him.

He is a successful businessman,
an outstanding writer in the field
of business education (having pub-
lished more than 40 textbooks in!
this field), a poet of much “human
appeal,” and a leading churchman,
being past president of the Presby-
terian Union of Maryland, presi-
dent of the Westminster Founda-
tion at the U. S. Naval Academy,
a member of the Board of Direc-
tors of the Westminster Founda.
tion of the Synod of Baltimore,
and secretary of the Maryland
Bible Society.

As president of the H. M. Rowe
Publishing Company of Baltimore,
Dr. Reigner exerts a wide infulence
in the field of business education.

DISTINGUISHED SERVICE
AWARD

The list of Dr. Reigner's honors
in Who's Who in America would do
credit to a college president. They
range from the Distinguished. Ser-
vice Award by the National Asso-
ciation and Council of Business
Schools to LL.D's and Litt.D’s by
American colleges and universi-
ties. ’

The list of his. philanthropies is
almost. equally impressive. Not on-
ly Davidson, but also Union Theo-

logical Seminary, Hampden-Sydney
College, Waynesburg College, and
the Lutheran Hospital of Mary-
land, Inc., in Baltimore are
recipients of his bounty.

Dr. Reigner is an alumnus of
Princeton University's college of
liberal arts. He studied also at the
Wharton School of Commerce and
Finance of the University of
Pennsylvania, at New York Uni-
versity, and at the University of
Pittsburg.

Crossing to a Free Land

Fleeing Soviet oppression in their native Hungary, these refugee families took to e
small makeshift bridge to cross the borderline canal into Austria. One of these families
will arrive soon in Davidson, thanks to the College Gift Fund which is getting under way.

Emphasizes Spirit of Ma

By LAURENS WALKER

“I see no hope that there will
be a revolt in Red China similar
to the recent revolt in Hungary,”
said Dr. T. Z. Koo, a native of
China and for more than forty
years a leader of student Christian
movements throughout the world.

Continuing Dr. Koo stated that!

the U: S. had lost face in the Far
East by not going to the .aid of
the Hungarian rebels. “You have
not ‘followed up your assurances
to the people of Hungary. Your
radio promised aid in a fight for
freedom, but all you have offered

is refugee aid. This will make the |

people of China think a long time:
before they revolt.”

situation.

Dr. Koo did add, however, that
“the United States does gain some
psychological value from continued
support of Nationalist China.”

Asked to comment on the future
of India, Dr. Koo thoughtfully
pointed out that the entire Orient
is in the process of going through
two types of revolution, political
and economic. “Nationalist China,”
Dr. Koo said, “won the political
revolution in China but, because of
|preoccupation with the Japanese,
jlost the economic revolution to
the Communists.”

REVOLUTION IN THE ORIENT

Applying this pattern to India,
‘Dr, Koo predicted that since there
was no war to distract Nehru, he

trol and direct the economic

Dr. Koo added that in a showdown
situation Nehru would side “with

effect on the present international. the West,” but “He would be the

last to admit it.”

Turning to religion, Dr. Koo was
asked what the strength of the
Christian Church is today in China.
Dr. Koo began his answer by say-
ing that, from a numerical stand-
point, the Church is still small,
but, from the viewpoint of influ-
ence, “the church is large out of
proportion because of its ‘pioneer-
ing in the field of higher educa-
tion.”

After. a moment of thought Dr.
Koo added in somewhat of an un-
derstatement that “of course, since
the Communist have come, things
are some different.” Continuing in
this vein, Dr. Koo said that three
alteratives face the Christian in
Communist China. “He can follow
the political line of the Commu-
nists and try to be Christian at
the same time. Very difficult to
do. He can speak out and voice:
his faith, but he is then likely to
be ‘eliminated.’ The last alterna-
