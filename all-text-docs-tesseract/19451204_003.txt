let me say something in passing about our football ‘sea-
son. We opened the season by playing host to Appalachain,
a game which cost us dearly even though the score was 7-7,
after a hectic fourth quarter.
tain_Bill McLean was forced to leave this game with a
shoulder injury. Then we took Darlington to the tune of
7-0. In this game we saw some of the best passing we saw
all year, but somehow our machine held every time they
threatened, seriously. On the following Saturday, the
Wildkittens and most of the Student Body visited Legion
Stadium in Charlotte and came back:a little P.O’ed. (That
is to say, a little put out.) Yes, Harding beat us 6-0. One
long pass, Coursey to Austin did the regrettable deed.
( This is a little prejudice don’t you think?) Barium paid

were inhospitable. That ended our home slate so
a crack at Riverside (and Brenau) down in the
of Gainsville, Ga. Note: Maybe it was raining all
the time, but I gotta say something nice about the place.
Anyway, we won and several of our backs and linemen
had a field day as did our extra point kicker who had to
kick one extra point twice hefore everybody was convinced
that he wasn’t just lucky. The final was 35-0. Woodbury
terminated the schedule and they were very inhospitable
too. This time I can quote you 18 durn good reasons. Sey-
eral of our regulars were unable to make the trip, but, make
no mistake, I’m not asking for the crying towel. I’m proud
of the showing we made.

Basketball is here as I said about fifteen minutes ago.
Coach is working hard (he keeps telling me, but I don’t
believe him ) to get his five men who click like they oughtta.
But as far as my four eyes can see, the men are working
many tims harder than the coach. Seriously;though, Coach
has sofne good material and will indubitably (!) mold it
into a winning quintet. He’s got a bad habit of turning out
good basketball teams. John Wall, Dave Neill, and Bob
Berry are back from last year’s team and they are having
to work hard to get starting berths wrested from them
by Brownson,;Schmidt;—Manor;— Morrison, Herndon,
Roach, rautmann. Practice sessions are moving
every aftefnoon and moving rapidly with the group fight-
ing to hold their present status and all others fighting
to gain that status.

achievement of the highest possible
flight of speed. It meant the dif-

animals pursued. The children, find-

solo, arranged races among them-

tablished as a contest—the
form of sport.

When man found that he

resent the idea of being pursued.
Man proceeded: to turn on ‘these

with rocks. If-he missed, he had to
run to safety. Realizing the need of
good marksmanship, the primitive
man practiced for accuracy, with

no place where the post graduate

This was met iff! 1888 by the organi-

to hold track and field meets open
