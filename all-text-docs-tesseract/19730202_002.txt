White Announces
College’s Intentions
To Matriculate 360

By JIMJERNIGAN
Staff Writer

Davidson College intends to
enroll next vear a Freshman
Class of approximately 360
students composed of 260 men
and almost 100° freshman
women, according to Director
of Admissions H. Edmunds
White.

This will be the largest class
Davidson has ever admitted
during one year. White said.

As of this week 717 persons
have applied for admission.
This includes 572 male and 145
female applicants.

Overall this constitutes an 11
percent increase over the 645
who had applied at this time
last year. However. the number
of male applicants. 572. has
declined from last vear’s 645
figure.

White expressed surprise by
this decline and is seeking to
remedy this situation by
preparing 8,000 new admissions
brochures to be mailed out shor-
tly.

Approximately 86  ap-
plications were received under
the Early Decision plan of
which 69 were from men and 17
were from women. A total of 65
have been accepted: 51 are
men, 14 are women. No blacks
applied for early decision.

Because the number of early
decision applications was the
greatest of the past five vears.
White feels that the students ac-
cepted are of a slightly higher
caliber than in years previous.

He further stated that a very
slight rise seems to be
developing in the overall
qualifications of the applicants.
White pointed out that the accep-
tance of only 260 freshman
males for next year would not
cause a decrease in the total
male population of the school. it
will remain at 1.000 as deter-
mined by the trustees.

This vear’s freshman class
had oa relatively — large
enrollment of 320 men, the Class
of ‘75 began with 300, over the
years. however, the average
class size has ranged between
270-290. White said.

Next vear’s apparent drop is
thus consistent with the
average.

White was reluctant to place a
number on enrolling blacks, but
he seemed encouraged by the
success of Larry Barr of the Ad-
missions office in recruiting
blacks. In fact more black
females have applied than have
black males. White said.
However. the total number of
blacks on campus should
definitely increase. he noted.

Davidson does not set any
quotas on admission nor will the
college lower standards of ad-
mission for anyone, White said.

The basic criterion is the
promise of academic success.
however special consideration
is given to various applicants
above this minimal level. he
said.

Alumni sons or daughters.
relatives of financial con-
tributors. ministerial students.
persons with special artistic or
talents or differing
cultural backgrounds and ex-
periences are given special
evaluation. White noted.

Additionally the College seeks
not to overload a particular
department with prospective
majors.

When asked if he was sur-
prised by small increase of
applicants. especially male, in
light of coeducation, White
stated. “Being coeducational
will tend to push the number of
applicants up. but private
schools nationwide are finding
it harder and harder to compete
with the cheaper state-funded

institutions. thus the
coeducational factor will
probably be balanced by

private school expense.”

THAT RUN DOWN FEELING
Davidson students are wishing they had never heard of the flu bug these days. The college infirmary
reports that it is treating around 25 students a day who have “f lu-like symptoms” such as a mild sore
throat, aches and pains, fever, slight cough, and a weak and run down feeling which lasts for 48 to 72
hours. There is no shot, no magic pill to treat flu symptoms. Only rest and aspirin will ease the in-
convenience, according to doc tors.

College Constitution Proposal
Given To Trustee Committee

By RICH WILSON
Editor-In-Chief

A proposal for a College
Constitution which defines and
distributes the areas of respon-
sibility of each constituency
was placed before the Trustee
Governance Committee last
week.

Drafted by trustee and law
school dean Dickson Phillips at
the request of the committee,
the proposal is the first concrete
model of governance studied by
them.

Governance Committee
Chairman Walter Lingle em-
phasized. however, that this
proposal is only a_ working
document. It has not been adop-
ted. In fact the faculty mem-
bers of the committee have
been requested to draw up an
alternate model to be presented
at the next committee meeting.

The major governing body
outlined in Phillips’ model is a
Faculty Assembly composed of
all members of the teaching
faculty; 10 members of the ad-
ministration including the
President, the vice presidents.
the Dean of Students, the direc-
tor of the library and up to five
additional administrative per-
sonnel; and an undetermined
number of students.

Under the plan. the students
would not be full members of
the assembly. but would serve
as “adjunct members.

In regular sessions of the
assembly, students would have
voting privileges just as regular
members, but the assembly
could vote to convene an
executive session in which
students would be required to
leave.

Although the © students’
representatives on the com-
mittee expressed willingness to
relinquish participation on such
topics as compensation, tenure
and other faculty professional
affairs, they expressed disap-
pointment that they could be
ejected from meetings for other
reasons.

The Faculty Assembly would
have jurisdiction over
educational policy, admissions
and the library. and a com-
mittee structure of standing
and special committees to sup-
port the assembly.

In addition to the assembly.
the proposal calls for the
establishment of “advisory
councils” to the administration

on finance and development,
campus life and athletics.
These councils would include
faculty, student and ad-
ministrative representatives
who would advise the president
with respect to operations,
programs and_ problems
relating to these areas of con-
cern.

The constitution includes
provisions instituting the
current Student Conduct
regulations and the powers and
organization of a student Senate
within the jurisdiction of trustee
review.

The constitution also has sec-
tions on academic freedom,
faculty employment = and
evaluation as well as
provisions for faculty and
student caucuses. but these

matters were left ambiguous
pending definition by the com-
mittee.

One purpose of the con-
stitution is to codify the gover-
ning structure of the college.
What constitutes the ad-
ministration is defined,.and the
general powers and duties of
the president are set down.

The constitution also calls for
the maintenance of a College
Registry which would include a
general table of administrative
organization, duties of ad-
ministrative officers, lists and
functions of committees and all
college regulations.

Another sidelight to the
proposal is the creation of a
chairman pro tem of the faculty
who will speak for the faculty in
