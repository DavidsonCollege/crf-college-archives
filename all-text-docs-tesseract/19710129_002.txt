Social Assignment

AN ANALYSIS

A decision apparently was
made this week that fresh-
men will no longer be ran-
domly assigned to fraterni-
ties; instead they will eat
with their freshman orienta-

tion group at different
houses.
However nether .tudent

leaders nor highly placed
administrators know who
made the decision.

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. said he had
no knowledge of this deci-
sion, and Vice President of
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan, who ehaired the
Committee of 18, said he had
not been informed of this
decision either.

Apparently Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry was respon-
stble for the change; how-

ever, as of press time he

was away from campus and

SGA President Ran Coble
was surprised to learn that
Terry had not checked this
idea with the administration.
“Will said he was going to
check this change with Dr.
Bevan, sO maybe it will not
go into effect until later."

Earlier, Terry had met
with the freshman hall
counselors and learned of
the difficulties of the: ran-
dom assignment. Apparent-

Jackson Examines Nixon

By W. E. Jackson Jr.

President ‘Nixon in his
January 24 State of the
Union message presented to
Congress ‘‘six great goals.”
The legislative branch, he
said, could open the way to
a “new American ‘revolu-
tion’’ by acting favorably
upon his proposals.

The first request of the
President is for Congress to
act upon unfinished business,
especially welfare reform.
The Administration program
would place a floor under
the income of families with
children, and also establish
work incentives and require-
ments. This is the most com-
mendable idea of the Presi-
dent's; it has a fair chance
of passage in ‘1971.

The second presidential
goal is to achieve, through
the FY 1972 budget, ‘‘full
prosperity in peacetime.”’
(Mr. (Nixon will submit an
expansionary; ‘‘full-employ-
ment’’: budget (spending as
if there was full employment
in the country).

Altered

mittee, but the powers of
this committee are unclear.

This committee, composed
of Coble, Fraternity. Presi-

dent Gary Cash, Freshman

Class President Bill Rals-
ton, and Committee of 18
member Bob Meadows, ap-
parently advised Terry to
change the random assign-
ment to assignment by orien-
tation groups on the fresh-
man hall,

Earlier Spencer indicated
to THE DAVIDSONIAN that
the Student Life Committee
would handle any changes.

for the new building and
said they plan to make re-
commendations on its loca-
tion by March 1.

(Meanwhile, college offici-
als report, library consul-
tant J. Russell ‘Bailey has
begun studying the list of
functional and program
needs as prepared by the
Library Planning Committee
and will soon begin drafting
the rough plans for interior
layout and traffic flow.

Chalmers G. Davidson, di-
rector of Davidson’s present
library and chairman of the
Library Planning Commit-
tee, said that the discussions
with architects John OD.
Owen and Addison Staples
of the firm Clark, Nexsen
and Owen of Lynchburg,
Va., produced a ‘‘verbal
agreement.”’

“The architects have as-
Sured us that they can have
plans ready for bidding by

‘contractors within a -year’s *~

time,’’ he explained. ‘‘This
will allow two months for

the basic flow diagrams,

‘two months for the prelimi-
naty schematics drawn to
scale, three months for fur-
ther design development, and
five. months for preparing
the final working plans and
Specifications. of —construc-
tion.”

" The third goal is to re-

store and enhance the na-

tural environment. The Pre-
sident promises ‘‘a ‘strong
new set of initiatives’’ to
fight air. and water pollu-
tion and to combat noise.
The Administration is still

(
deommitted to the SST.) He

also proposes the expansion
vf parks and recreation
areas: ‘‘For only if we have
a legacy of parks will the
next generation have parks
to enjoy.”’ !

As a fourth goal the Pre-
sident promises to offer a
set of proposals for improv-
ing health care and making
it available ‘‘more fairly to
more people."’ Most ambiti-
ously, he speaks of a pro-
gram to insure that ‘‘no
American family will be pre-
vented from obtaining basic
medical care by inability to
pay.”

It is difficult to see what
form this program will take
without alienating a major
source of campaign financial
support for the President,
the members of the Ameri-
can Medical Association
‘But because of a competing
national health insurance
idea from Sen. Kennedy and
the ‘high cost of medical
care, it seems likely that
the new Congress will pass
legislation in this field.

The fifth. goal, already
generating extensive niation-
al debate, is a sharing of
$16 billion in national gov-
ernment revenues with
states and localities. Speci-
fically, the President would
provide $5 billion in new
funds, to be used. as the
States and localities see fit,
and $1 billion (to be taken
largely from present federal
grant programs) to be spent
for six broad purposes: ur-
ban development, rural de-
velopment, education, trans-
portation, job training, and
‘law-enforcement. Congres-
sional passage will be dif-
ficult: due to the opposition
of ‘Wilbur (Mills, chairman of
the House Ways & Means
Committee.

The sixth goal articulated
by the (President, and the
one least likely to see the
light of legislative day, is
a sweeping reorganization of
the executive branch of gov-
ernment. This would require
the reduction of the present
12 Cabinet departments to

This proposal is an im.
pressive effort to reduce the
number of departments sub-
stantially in the grip of pa-
rochial interests (e. g. La-
bor, Commerce, Interior,
ericulture).

What is wrong with the
state of the union according
to Richard Nixon? Part of
the problem lies in the pub-
lic relations wrapping around
his proposals. As James
Reston has put it, ‘‘he stood
on a box and talked more
about the State of Tomor-
row than about the State
of the Union today.”

His speech was compar-

_able to an insurance sales.
man's dream of the “golden
years” in which there ‘would
be no more war, inflation,
unemployment laziness or
unpaid hospital bills.

Ina substantive sense,
there are two great flaws in

_ tirely

the speech. They pertain to
national priorities and the
War. ~

In regard to priorities, I
doubt that (Mr. Nixon is wil-
ling or able to put the money
where the needs are, so long
as Vietnam costs more than
he promises the state and
cities in shared revenue.

TRere must be money,
more’ money, to-share. The
President separates the $70
billion defense budget from
“revenue sharing,’ and ap
parently believes that he can
play at (Pax Americana in
the world and still have all
the dreams of the insurance
advertisements. In short, he
is ducking the costs of his
defense ‘and foreign. policies.

The state of this nation
cannot be talked about en-
in domestic’ terms.
But not once did the ®Presi-
dent mention the Southeast
Asian War.

He did speak to millions
of frustrated Americans in
general terms: ‘‘We> are go-
ing to give you a new chance
to have more to say about
the decisions that affect
your future — to participate
in government.” And: ‘The
further away government is
from. people, the stronger
government becomes and the
weaker people become.’’

Surely the President does
not believe the people's
frustrations stop at the wat-
er's edge. Yet, the recent
actions in Cambodia suggest
that the Administration is
rising above (or ignoring)
what a great many people
have already had to say.

The (President pledged last
June to get American ground
troops out of Cambodia, and ~
he stated ‘‘there will be no
new US. air or logistic sup-
port’’ of future South Viet-
namese operations in Cam-
bodia. The Administration
also stressed that this’ coun-
try was not committed to
the Lon Nol government.

I believe that the recent
air combat operations over
Cambodia flouted both pub-
lic disapproval of last
spring's invasion and the
Congress’ clear intent in re-
cent legislation to avoid
U.S. involvement in a widen-
ed war.

(Mr. Nixon seems unable to
understand that one of the
things that frustrates Ameri-
cans most is a war with-
out end ‘and without reason,
about which the people have
so little say. Is the most
powerful man in the world
a man who listens?
