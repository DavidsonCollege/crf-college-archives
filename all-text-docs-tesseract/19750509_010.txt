Diamonders squeak by Bears .
_ End season with 21-15 record

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

In their last game of the
season the Davidson Wildcats
beat the Lenoir-Rhyne Bears 3-2
in a tight game which went
twelve innings.

Joel Tew was the winning
pitcher as the junior wound sg
his season record at 8-4.

Things started out slowly for
the Cats as Lenoir-Rhyne
scored in the first inning to
make the score 1-0. Davidson
was hurting at the plate as the

Big man instills optimism

I have seen recruiting and
been close to the men who do it
(as a reporter) for years. I have
seen optimism shattered with
doubts, and _ expectations
crushed with reality.

I cannot help but feeling that
this is the year; that the
miracle, which the coaching
staff here has expected, has
occurred.

The pessimism on the campus
about basketball has been
prevalent for the past couple
years. And I claim no exemp-
tion from the feeling.

However, I think someone
would have to go a long way in
this world to find four men
more optimistic and hopeful
than Bo. Brickels, Jim
Larranaga, Harry Krohn and
James Brown. And when your
team has just come off a 7-19
season, the students are
beginning to get apathetic, and
the days of Lefty and Hetzel are
memories which become un-
pleasant as people, agonize for
their return, it is pretty tough to
remain optimistic.

Krohn told me emphatically
in January that ‘‘We are going
to get the big man.’’ He did.
Larragana told me we needed a
super scorer and inside man. He
got them. Brickels felt the need
for a new attitude. I think he
may just have the essential
ingredients.

Perhaps optimism rubs off
where it shouldn’t. All I know is
that the optimism of these men
has captured me. It seems to
me that there is real reason to
get excited about Davidson
basketball. Not just because we
have the big man. But we have
others to go with him, both in
newcomers and returnees. The
combination looks pretty good.

Brickels said to me that this
may enable him to change the
“Davidson Way,’ which is “‘if
you don’t think you can win in
basketball, don’t get up tight
about it and then when it doesn’t
happen, you don’t feel let
down.” He thinks he can change
that. And I, for one, believe he
certainly can. At least I hope so.

Of course, one can always use
the example of the claim
Kentucky fans made four years
ago, when they had four super
prospects. Kentucky floundered
for a couple years, finally
putting it together this
year...when they got someone
besides a 6-7 forward to play the
post.

Brickels remembers that ig:
and told me, “Just be. ore you

know {hat i thev on when they ©
got the big man so their for-
ag played where they

belong.’’ His point may be will
taken.

With the big man in the
middle, the way should be
opened for the guards to get
better shots from the outside, as
well as to play a_ tougher
defense, knowing that behind
them is a center big enough to
intimidate just about any
guard. Size certainly can make
the difference.

Personally, I think things look
good; good enough to be highly
optimistic about the basketball
future, good enough to look for
the return of the dominance of
the Lefty Era.

Brickels said he felt his job
would be somewhat simpler
next year, having this wealth of
talent to work with. He said he
might just not ‘count this past
season on his record.

And I reminded him of
another coach, who was allowed
by everyone else to discount
that first season. The man was
Vic Bubas, who is probably one
of the greatest college coaches
in recent times. Every one for-
got his poor first season record
after he put together a long
string of 20-win seasons for
Duke...all done with the help of
people like Art Heyman, Jeff
Mullins, Bob Verga, etc.

came through with a clutch
double to put Stone on third.

Then reliable George Weicker

INTRODUCING
The Endless Feast

Imagine all the Prime Ribs

- you can eat
and

a walk to first as the Bear
pitcher Sloan made one of his
few mistakes of the day. Lynn,
who is one of the fastest and
most able of the Wildcat
baseruners stole second.

Then Sophomore - Jim
Yearwood hit an infield out to
advance Lynn to third. At this
point Dale Horner knocked a
hard shot to centerfield to score
Lynn and win the game for the
Cats.

“I was pleased with the win
over Lenoir-Rhyne especially |
after losing such a close game
to them earlier in the season,”’
commented first year coach
Junior Wade.

The Cats wound up the
regular season with a very
respectable 21-15 record and a
second place in the Southern
Conference.

Commented Wade, ‘‘We are
going to take it easy for a while
and we will know Monday if we
are going to get a NCAA tour-
nament bid.”’
