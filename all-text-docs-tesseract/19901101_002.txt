Davidson Host North

Carolina Student Legislature

By TOM KOONCE

Recently Davidson was the
hostschool for the Interim Council
of the North Carolina Student Leg-
islature (NCSL). Around 150 stu-
dents from 18 schools across North
Carolina gathered for this event.

The NCSL is the oldest active
student legislature in the country.
It provides students with close-up
education in the political and leg-
islative process. The NCSL also
gives students a statewide forum
for voicing their opinions and
concerns on current state and na-

tional issues. Alumni of the NCSL
include former Governor Jim Hunt
and Senator Terry Sanford.

Over the weekend the students
debated several topics including
the legality of spousal rape and
legal immigration. The debates
lasted seven and a half hours on
Saturday and seven hours on Sun-
day.

Besides these debates there
was a legislative reception Satur-
day afternoon. Several important
North Carolina politicians were
invited to the reception but only
one Charlotte area representative

actually attended the event. The
NCSL also had receptions at the
FIGI house on both Friday and
Saturday nights.

The Davidson NCSL Dele-
gation Chairperson is Kyle Kin-
ner. Other members are Warren
Cooksey, Seth McLaughlin, Chris
Gray and Wilson Hardcastle. Kin-
nercommented on the weekend by
saying, “Everyone had a really
good time and Davidson looked
great.” The NCSL is open to all
Davidson students and will hold
its next meeting Monday Novem-
ber Sth in the Union.

from a projectconcerning the con-
servation of sea turtles to a literacy
campaign in Central America.”
Ortmayer also notes that previous
experience abroad has provided
these nominees with ideas for their
projects.

Hoyle hopes to study the ef-
fects of wildlife ranching for the
preservation of sea turtles in Suri-
nam, South Africa, the Cayman
Islands, Kenyaand Zimbabwe. Her

interest stems from work with sea
turtles on Cumberland Island and
the study of conservation in the
rain forests of Australia.

Dunn hopes to study adult lit-
eracy and popular education pro-
grams in Central America. She
plans to apply what she learns about
the differing methods of teaching
people to read to her own career as
a teacher.

Jobe is interested in exploring
opportunities for Western manage-
ment techniques in business firms
of France, Germany, Belgium and
the Soviet Union. His interest was
sparked after spending a summer

studying management theory atthe
University of Chicago Graduate
School of Business.

After spending his junior year
in Wuerzburg, Germany, Murphy
hopes to return to study the eco-
nomic and political transitions of
German reunification by living on
acollective farm and working ina
textile mill town.

Each of these nominees must
now interview with the director of
the Watson program. In the past,
Davidson College has averaged ap-
proximately two winners each year.
Scholarship recipients will be
announced March 15.

Every autumn, Davidson’s
tree-filled campus provides the
Physical Plant with acolorful car-
pet that must be dealt with. In
Davidson’s case, some of these
leaves as wellas other refuse have
found a home behind the cross
country trail in an area that some
refer to by a four-letter word:
dump.

However, according to Irvin
Brawley of Davidson’s Physical
Plant, this is not technically a
dump site. He refers to it as a
demolition and composting site.
Thisterminology impliesthatonly
biodegradable refuse is allowed
to be dumped there. Leaves and
other natural wastes are items that
are commonly taken to the site.

Davidson has 450 acres of
continuous land, and this demoli-

Dump Site Is
"Not Permanent”

tion site is located off the cross-
country trail. Brawley says that
this is the most economical way
to dispose of these wastes. It is
also highly monitored by, the
Physical Plant so that no non-
biodegradable wastes are dumped
there.

The demolition site is not per-
manent, according to the Physi-
cal Plant, so there is no question
about what will happen when
space runs out. The Physical Plant
is now negotiating a deal with
BFI for alarge 40-yard container
that will hold the biodegradable
wastes until they decompose.

The site is legal, and accord-
ing to Brawley, is totally ap-
proved. The Physical Plant’s
Stated intentions are the disposal
of these biodegradable wastes in
the most inexpensive way pos-
sible.
