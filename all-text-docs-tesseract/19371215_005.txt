Clubs Hold

Assemblies)

Broadway to Lead Philan-

thropics; Eumenean Takes
In New Men

Both of the Literary Socie-
ties, Philanthropic and Eumen-
ean, held regular bi-monthly
meetings last Tuesday night.
The societies are showing re-
newed vigor, and are begin-
ning to reassume the high
places they once maintained

on the campus.
Eumenean

At the meeting of the Eu Society
Tuesday night, the feature was the
initiation of several of the appli-
cants for membership who had
been accepted. J. W. Holland, T. P.
Johnston, S. G. Lowe, and Dave
Woodward were taken into the so-
ciety.

George Grantham and Tommy
Glenn applied for membership to
the society and were accepted.
Grantham read his personal criti-
cism of a current movie, and Glenn
gave a talk on the subject of “Sub-
sidization of Athletics in Relation
to Davidson.”

After the reading of these pap-

- ers, President Dick Vowles called
for extemporaneous comments con-
cerning the subject of Glenn's talk.
Quite a few members responded,
and arguments were advanced pro-
and con in respect to this subsi-

» dization,

Philanthropic

At the Philanthropic Literary So-
ciéty meeting a set of new officers
were clected. Bill Broadway was
elected president: Rodman  Wil-
liams, vice-president; Joe Gammon,
secretary; and Bill Manson and
Ivan Wetmore, critics. Jack Aber-
nathy was chosen to remain as
treasurer of the society. «

throughout the year the members !

“would strive to carry on the long
and honorable traditions oi the so- |

~ ciety. “He announced that the pro-

To Europe on the “Queen Mary”
or the “Normandie!’ That's the
thrill! that Chubby King and his
band are to experience next sum-
mer, when the young maestro plans
to take his band so the continent
for a six weeks period.

Final details for the European
trip have not been formulated, but
on his return Chubby and his band
will play a six weeks engagement
at Hotels Markham in Gulfport,
Miss.. one of the prime playgrounds
in the South. Plans following this
engagement have not been settled
upon, but the orchestra may return
to Mayview Manor in Blowing
Rock, where they plaved most. sic-
cesstully during the last) summer...
Chubby and the boys have décid-
ed not to take any engagements
during the Christmas holidays.
Some of them have not visited their
homes since. Spring Holidays last
year, since the engagement at May-
view Manor lasted all summer, _
They. reached this conclusion not
to play any Christmas engagements
since they were unable to book
nights straight through.

Chubby organized: his band dur-
ing his freshman year, and different
members have come‘and gone. He
plays nightly at the College Ina
here in Davidson, as he has done .
for the past two years. He has also
playgd for a large number of school
dances in this section of the Caro-
linas,
