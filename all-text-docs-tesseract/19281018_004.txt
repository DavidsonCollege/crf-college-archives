Dr. Smith's prominence in the edu-
cational life of the South has been in-
dicated by the frequent editorial com-
ments which have appeared since an-
nouncement was made of his retire-
ment. The alumni office has on file
editorials from The Charlotte Observ-
er, The Greensboro Daily News, and
The Richmond Times-Dispatch, all of
which lauded him for his attainments
during his career,

The Charlotte Observer declared that
“Dr, Smith's administration of the
affairs at that (Washington and Lee)
university was productive of many ad-
vancements” and then cited the erec-
tion of a gymnasium and the establish-
ment of a school of journalism, The
Greensboro Daily News said that “if
any man is entitled to free himself from
the responsibilities of a university pres-
idency, here is one.” The editor went
on to say “the imprint of his person-
ality, of his eager energy and of his
strong character is not so easily re-
moved.” The Richmond Times-Dis-
patch expressed the opinion that he
“has given to Washington and Lee a
notable administration, and he may

Charlotte, tomorrow night at 7:30
o'clock, in the office of Dr. Hamilton
W. McKay, '06, president of the Gen-
eral Association and council, At that
time a number of matters will be pre-
sented for discussion, one of the prin-
cipal items being a discussion of the
Homecoming Day program, and select-
ing speakers for the occasion,

Other matters for deliberation will
be the question of the method to be
adopted in obtaining funds for the op-
eration of the alumni office, whether a
Davidson College radio program will
be presented over Station WBT in
Charlotte on a night preceding Home-
coming Day, and minor items concern-
ing the operation of the home office
at Davidson,

The Alumni Secretary will present a
plan to the council of issuing a minia-
ture alumni bulletin as an experiment,
through which he would obtain the
opinion of alumni regarding the ad-
visability of making this a monthly af-
fair, which would ultimately develop
into a magazine.

In addition to Dr. McKay, president,
members of the council are Dr. J. P.
Matheson, ‘99, of Charlotte; Dr. J. C.

Jim Appleby, secretary of the Y. M.
C. A. last year said, “When Dr, ‘Tolly’
smiles you feel good all over, and you
say to yourself, ‘There is a real Chris-
tian. There isa man. There must be
something in the Christian life if it can
claim the loyalty of such a man as
that.’ Fellows, if you hear Dr, Thomp-
son once, you will hear him every time
he is there.”

Such expressions of satisfaction ov-
er the selection of Dr, Thompson for
the series have come in from numbers
of alumni and faculty members who
are closely acquainted with him.
