Rough Seas For The Vagabonds

It’s been rough sailing recently for
the Vagabonds.

The dedicated little crew of drama-
Jovers has been fighting a flood of
troubles—big troubles and little nag-
ging annoyances.

Now it’s beginning to look as though
the Vagabonds Success Story may turn
into a Sob Story.

A tiny staff is swamped with work:
rehearsals, set design, publicity,
lighting, budget-stretching, subscrip-
tion sales, casting, and a host of other

Help promised long ago has never
materialized. Professors offered their
services as directors, then never pro-

And then the little annoyances:

A Vagabonds publicity blurb which

For a while a bizarre financial plan,
hog-tied in red tape, made paupers of
the Vagabonds— even though they
had a bank account.

It worked like this: Vagabond Treas-
urer Bob Denham couldn't even write
a check. All expenditures had to be
approved first by Bursar McGill and
then by Business Manager Currie. No
new cash could be drawn until the
last pocketful had been completely
used up.

A Hangover For New Year's

DAVIDSONIAN interview that the
Committee on Academic Scheduling

Diversification Or Eating Clubs ?

When the faculty met November 1
to conduct its regular business and to

discuss Sophomore Rush, Dr. John
B. Gallent proposed that the fraterni-
ties be forced to abolish any sort of
pledge program with the exception of
formal initiation.

“Pledges” would, under this system,
be initiated into the fraternity as soon
as national regulations would permit.

We don’t know what sort of support
Dr. Gallent’s proposal was given by
the faculty. We hopé none at all.

tend fraternity study halls. We feel
that a freshman who makes a weekly
trip with his pledge class to Barium
Springs or to the Gastonia Orthopedic
Hospital has gained something very
concrete from his pledge program.

We aren’t trying to whitewash the
pledge programs. They still have some
senseless aspects and some senseless
people backing them up.

Granted, some of these programs
need cleaning up. This, we are will-
ing to do.

But our point is, the fraternities
need pre-initiation activities in order
to keep themselves from degenerat-
ing into eating clubs. Without pledge
training, diversification in individual
fraternity structure is likely to break
down; each fraternity will become a
loose group of 40 to 50 boys no more
closely tied together than any other
campus organization.

We don’t pretend to claim that all
pledge activities are constructive; we
can’t defend Jaundry and _ stud-run-
ning or some of the little “games”
that pledges are sometimes forced to
play.

But we do defend requiring pledges
to visit each brother within a certain
period during the fall. We also argue
that pledges should be required to at-

Early College Acceptanc
Now Possible At Davidson

By DAVID JORDAN

Davidsonian Managing Editor

(Editor's Note: This is the
first in a series of articles which
will discuss Davidson's admis-
sions standards and policies.)

An outstanding high school
senior, who has made Davidson
his definite college choice, can
now avoid months of needless
waiting and receive a decision
on his application in November
under the college’s new Early
Decision Plan.

The new policy is being tried
on an experimental basis this
year. It has been in effect for
about three years in some east-
ern schools.

23 ACCEPTED

“Letters will be going out in
the near future to 23 boys who
have been approved by the com-
mittee.” H. Edmunds White. As-
sociate Director of Admissions,

week. These names will be

' available for publication the
‘first week of December.

‘gram at Davidson, a prospec-

tive. student may. apply for an

Davidson is his first college
choice, that he has not applied
to any other college, and that
he will enroll at Davidson if ac-
cepted. The program is directed
to the exceptional rather than
average student.

Acceptance is based on the

explained. “Others will be’ car-
ried over for later considera-
tion under the regular plan, ex-

regular plan, except that rec-
ords are based on the first
three years of high school only.
An applicant must have taken
the college boards during his
juhior year.

NUMBER REDUCED

“Since we didn’t publicize the
program extensively until late
August, the number of possible
applications was reduced. Many
interested had not had college
boards. Another factor was the
short period of time for com-
pleting applications,” White
said.

Applications must be received
by October 15. Students are
notified in November and must
pay a $100 fee by December 1.

his senior year completed early.
The college can have a number
of strong applicants with Dav-
idson at first choice.

“This eliminates much of the
guesswork about how many of
those accepted in the spring
will enroll. Without such a plan,
we could not guarantee excep-
tional students in the fall that
they would be accepted. To be
safe, they would have to apply
elsewhere also, and most of
these boys are ones we wouldn’t

want seriously investigating
other schools.”
However, the college isn’t

anxious to get too many early
applicants. There is no restric-
tion yet on the number who
could be accepted, but present
feeling is not to exceed 10 per
cent of the final class enroll-
ment.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Student Criticizes Scheduling
For Holidays As Irresponsible

Williams

Dear Editor:

I consider the scheduling of
Christmas holidays a very ir-
responsible policy of the David-
son College administration. I
know of no other college which
requires its students to be back
in classes on Jan. 2, 1961, and
I know several reasons why

Davidson students should not

be required to do so.

First, Jan. 2 is a national
legal holiday because New
Year‘s Day falls on a Sunday.
This is not just a holiday ob-
served by banks and govern-
ment offices. This holiday is
observed by all of the nation's
businesses and industries and
most of the public schools.
Even court decisions have up-
held such a day as a legal
holiday.

Second and most important,
the college policy is irrespon-
sible because of transportation
conditions. It is bad enough to
drive on America’s highways on
a weekend or holiday. By com-
bining the two, the college is
simply asking for the death or
injury of some student.

Not only are driving condi-
tions bad, but it would seem
that the college has not thought
of those students who will have

to drive several days under

these conditions because they
live 500 miles or more away
from school.

One may argue that public
transportation should be used
in this case. Vet, anyone with
experience knows thet such
facilities are often very unre-
liable at this season and will
be especially so this year be-
cause of the odd holiday sit-

vation.

I am free to discuss this prob-
lem with any member of the ad-
ministration. This is not a plea
for an extra day off. I under-
stand the college has ap-
proached the limit which ac-
crediting allows. Nevertheless, I
hope the administration will not
adopt the “once a policy always
a policy” attitude and will dis-
cuss this issue. |

John L. Williams.

Caldwell

Dear Editor:

A week ago I overheard
people talking in the dormitory.
One Big-Brotherly voice went
something like this: “We put
this burden on you to see if you
can stand up under it. We take
up your time with personal ser-
vices to teach you discipline—
to teach you to get your studies
in half the time. . .”

t hope the freshman listen-
ing to this realized that what
he was really hearing was
“Look, Bud, I'm your frater-
nal superior, and no matter
how much time your profes-
sors require, by damn i‘m
going to get my share.”

Is this really our attitude to-
ward pledge programs? Is the
object of stud-running and shoe-
shining and car-washing actual-

ly “to create unity in the pledge
class,” or is it because we had
to do it when we were fresh-
men?

It seems that fraternities as-
sume one of two things: that
either freshmen are basically
immature and need all the
“help’’ they can get, or that
freshmen are mature, and wor-
thy of becoming Brothers at the
end of the probationary educa-
tional period.

if they are basically imma-
ture the majority will either
be bad pledges or bad stu-
dents, or both, under such
programs as this. It’s like
teaching someone to swim by
throwing him overboard with
a 75-pound weight on his
back.

On the other hand, if fresh-
men are mature men they don’t
need such “help” and will re-
fuse to spend time they can’t
afford obeying the whims of
upperclassmen.

I don’t recommend junking
all pledge requirements. But
let's throw out these personal
requirements that are nothing
more than opportunities for our
paranoid brothers to make like
gods for a few freshmen. We
should be ashamed that the fac-
ulty condemned these ego-cen-
tered idioctes before we con-
demned them ourselves.

“Ayak?” one of them asks,

“Akia,” responds the other.

Two members of the Ku Klux
Klen, unknown to each other,
in the
“invisible Empire.” To them,
“Ayak’’ means, “Are you a
Klansman?” and “Akia means,
“A Klansman f am.”

It was as if the shadows of

history had receded and there,
reincarnated in the bright sun-
light of the New South, was
some half-forgotten obscenity.

A grief ago, it would all
have been so natural, so un-
derstandable, so forgivable.
In 1868, or even in the dismal
decades that followed, there
would have been reasons.

There are no valid reasons to-
day,

Yet the ritual is repeated in
turnip patches and broomsage
fields and on bayous and under
moss-festooned oaks throughout
the South. And so are all of the
other rituals that make so many
southerners the prisoners of a
terrible - inheritance.

For southerners, however
they may deny it, are still tight-
ly, perhaps even inextricably,
bound to a deliberate, self-con-
scious mystique. John Brown’s
soul may or may not go march-
ing on, depending on which
side of the Mason-Dixon line
you learned your songs, but the
passions it unleashed still take
their toll.

Why do these bones and

dust, relics and fragments of
an American Juggernaut, still
stir the air to life? The
enswers lie in a history of
human convulsions and awful
travail, long remembered and
long resented. It is what
James Branch Cabell was tatk-
ing about in “The Rivet In
Grandfather’s Neck”:

Our actual tragedy isn’t that
our fathers were badly treated,
but that we ourselves are con-
stitutionally unable to do any-
thing except talk about how
badly our fathers were treated.

Then, too, as Marshall Fish-
wick wrote much later, to be a
Confederate today isn't nearly
as dangerous as it was in the
1860's. No risk, no marching, no
bleeding. The pose is there for
the taking. .

The central tragedy of the
modern. South is that even its
best efforts are so terribly ten-
tative. Its leaders often speak
grandly of economic revolution
and social progress, on the one
hand, while pledging allegiance
to dusty concepts of 19th cen-
tury conservatism on the other.
If there is any such thing as
southern liberalism in the na-
tion today, more often than not
it masquerades demurely under
the label of moderation.

Moderation has its virtues
—if the choice is between two
violent forms of self-destruc-
tion. But, logically, there can
be no moderation on the
broad principles involved in
the safeguarding of human
rights, in the advancement of
elementary democracy, in the
promotion of economic prog-
ress, in the protection and
improvement of public edu-
cation and in the develop-
ment of the health, mental

aptitudes and physical vigor
of the region’s humen re-
sources,

Only the vibrant qualities of
a South that is extremely con-
cerned, extremely determined
and extremely enlightened can
make gains which are perman-
ent and enduring. Moderation
in these matters has no legiti-
macy whatsoever.

> ¢@ ®

The exciting fact is that this
could be the Southern Century.
All around us are the resources
of social and economic great-
ness—resources which, so far,
have been barely touched in
four centuries,

There is a compression of
human energy within one or-
bit, a potentiality and vitality
of people. True enough, the
South is brash, sensitive, un-
sure and provincial. {¢ is an
unpredictable and intractable
region. But these very quali-
ties give it an explosive prom-
ise unmatched anywhere in
America.

Together with its rich abun-
dance of untapped natural re-
sources, its forests, its miner-
als, its water and its magnifi-
cent climate, it offers the prom-
ise of unimaginable wealth and
progress.

It is perfectly true that hu-
man problems are posed here
with singular directness and
nakedness. For better or worse,
it ig the unique place where the
great social dilemmas of our
age inevitably take hold of the
individual. Furthermore, the
South in 1959 is still a pande-
monium of harsh voices.

But the voices have turned
sour.

More than sound and fury,
the modern South needs bold
and enlightened leadership.
More than rant, it needs rea-
son. It needs men to voice its
true aspirations and direct its
true destiny, men who will
not permit America’s profes-
sion of faith in equal oppor-
tunity and freedom for the
human spirit to be watered
down, whether in the name of
expediency or the plea of ex-
terior menace.

Nor can such leaders be sat-
istied with the knowledge that
progress has been made. Of
course, progress has been made.
But the distance the South has
come must stand always as a
reminder of the distance yet to
be traveled.

Despite the cynics and -the
hot-eyed prophets of disaster,
we maintain that southerners
will respond to such leadership
if it is offered.

But there must be a sense
of revival, a renaissance of
something old in new and en-
lightened terms. The best of
the southern tradition must
be preserved and the worst
discarded, Furthermore, the
battle is here. It must be
fought here with our own
people. The response must
come as much from the red-
necks and wool hat boys as
from the professors and the
politicians and the manvufac-
turers of the dominant middle
class.

With wise and courageous
leadership, the region can tri-
umph over the cobwebs of pride
and prejudice. For the nay-say-
ers of the North are wrong. The
story of the modern South is
not that it exists as an endur-
ing embodiment of human
wrong but as an enduring em-
bodiment of human possibili-
ties. The possibilities, fully real-
ied, can make this the Southern
Century.
