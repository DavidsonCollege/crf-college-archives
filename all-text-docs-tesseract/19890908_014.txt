CHALLENGE, from page 12

come out to play.”

Hawkins said that despite
the fact that the competition
was not of the caliber that her
club will face during the sea-
son, the matches were a good
workout. “The teams we
faced, because they are not as
skilled as college teams, are
unpredictable,” said Hawkins.
“This means that our players
have to really concentrate. The
teams don’t settle into a bump,
pass, spike routine; a ball can
come over at any time.”

The challenges allowed
Hawkins to see her team play-
ing in match conditions. “Ra-
chel Thompson (freshman)
looked better than she has in
practices,” said Hawkins. “She
made some tough digs and
passes in the clutch.” The en-
tire squad looked good in de-
feating their opponents; they
can only hope that the regular
season will go as well.

SOCCER, from page 13

“Our goal is to getan NCAA
bid,” said Poisson. “Only 28
teams in Division I make it and
we want to be one of them.”

Slagle echoes that sentiment.

“We want to play as well as
we can. Soccer is a ~break’ type
of sport. You have to make
your own breaks. Sometimes
they go your way, sometimes
they don’t.”

“But I would be happy if we
were still being considered for
an NCAA bid on the last day of
the season,” he concluded. “In

-all, I am confident of a good
season.”

PREVIEW, from page 12

|’ jected starters transferred.

Schiavi, along with junior
Britt Hammett and sopho-
more Eric Moledor, will be
asked to step in and handle
the linebacking chores.

The secondary is riddled
with uncertainty since last
year’s only returning starter,
Milt Watson, will be out two
to four weeks with a leg in-
jury. Senior Mike Carney,
junior Mike Noonan, sopho-
mores Andy Hunt and Lin-
sey Mills, and senior Todd
Sautter are competing for the

four slots and wilFlikely see a
great deal of playing time.

The Wildcat schedule for

1989 seems to always pro-
duce a peculiar reaction:
“Millsaps? Who the hell is
Millsaps?” One may ask the
same question about many of
the Wildcat opponents.
Although the teams are un-
familiar, the competition will
be fierce. Coach Gatto and his
staff have put together one of
the toughest Division III
schedules in the nation. Fer-
rum was 11-1 last year with
its only loss coming in the na-
tional championship game.

Wagner was 8-2 and com-
peted in the Division III play-
offs. Dayton has always been
at the top of the Division III
standings, and was 7-3 last
year. Fordham is currently
making the transition to Divi-
sion IAA in the Colonial
League, and VMIisa Division

IAA member of the Southern

Conference.

What does all this mean for
the 1989 season? Will the divi-
sion change put more wins on
the board?

The Wildcats should start
out strong. The starting 11 on
both sides of the ball can

compete with every team on
the schedule. If enthusiasm,

~ drive and determination are

good for a few touchdowns,
this year’s Wildcat Club
could climb to above the .500
mark. However, given the
lack of depth on both sides of
the ball, come mid-October
the injury bug may hit and
the final four weeks of the

_season could be a struggle.

- This year’s edition of the
football team should defi-
nitely fare better than its re-
cent predecessors. The Wild-
cats should finish with a re-
spectable 5-5 record.

Signs such as this have been popping up around campus lately, calling basket-
ball sensation Bruce Elder to leave the courts of Vanderbilt and return home.
