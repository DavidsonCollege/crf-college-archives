Self Study Report Readied,

Curriculiem Changes Ex pected

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

It appears likely that the
College Self-Study report which
will be prepared by a faculty
committee this winter will
recommend several changes in
the present curiculum.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan said that
he expects the report will in-
clude recommendations for in-
creasing career service options
and the number of in-
terdisciplinary courses and
seminars, as well as possible
calendar modifications.

The last self-study, un-
dertaken during the 1963-64
school year was instrumental in
initiating the extensive reforms
that were made in_ the
curiculum in the late 1960's.

At that time. the curriculum
was altered radically. the
present trimester format
replaced the old semester
calendar. and such options as
extended studies were made
available

However. Bevan does not ex-
pect this year’s seli-study to
cause an\ major upheavals
and characterized the study as

an evaluation of where we

nave been and a projection ot
where we are going next.” but
ne emphasized thal any
changes will pe to ‘entorce
tulure existing trends

‘What we have been doing
since 1968 is articulating the
Blue Sk\ report. and now we
must decide where to trom
here. he said

Bevan said he did expect the
report make  recom-

mendation on the current con-
troversy regarding the religious
requirement for tenure. but that
he could not anticipate with

certainty what other recom-
mendations might be made.

“Anything that is on the
minds of the faculty at the time
will be incorporated into the
study."’ he said.

The 1963-64 report included
close to 200 recommendations
which covered all aspects of
collegee life.

Several recommendations
may be made concerning the
alternatives to the present
calendar format.

It is a distinct possibility that
the report may recommend the
present calendar be revamped
to incorporate year-round
study, featuring an integrated
program of classroom study.
career service. and_ in-
dependent research. Such a
program would be a similar to
that presently offered by Beloit
College in Wisconsin. However.
Bevan pointed out that since the
majority of Davidson students
go on to. graduate or
professional schools the
traditional prrequisite courses
must still be offered

In addition to recom-
mendations concerning career
service and = interdisciplinary
course offerings. the report
may recommend that there be
more emphasis placed upor
student originated study

Student originated study 11
volves giving credit for studen:
research done on a more stri

tured cP than extended
studies. It would not preempt
extended studies.

The period of self-study does
not end officially until the
spring of 1975 when a review
board sent ‘by the Southern
Association of College and
Schools (ASCS) will visit thee
campus to confirm the report
and offer their recom-
mendations.

Recommendations for any
major changes in curriculum,
calendar, etc. would not be ac-
ted upon until that time;
however, Bevan emphasized
that this does not mean that
there will be no changes for
several years.

“Things which are noticed
during the course of the study
will be acted upon as needed,”’
he said.

The preparation of the self-
study began this week witth the
election of the Steering Com-
mittee by the faculty. The com-

Careless Errors Complicate
Present Registration System

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Managing Editor

“Any error is a large error
when you work by number
alone.’ So cautioned Registrar
Richard C. Burts Jr. He went on
to explain several problems the
registrar's office must cope
with and why Davidson students
presently use the preference
card system to set up their
schedules

Burts feels that the preferen-
ce card system is a_ better
system than those used in the
past. However, as in any
registration procedure, there is
always room for improvement.

Perhaps the most significant
advantage of the preference
card system is that it provides a
maximum opportunity for
students to get what they signed
for on their pre-registration
cards. This is especially a relief
for freshmen students.

Burts commented that there
are now about only 700 places
filled by the time freshmen
come up for registration com-
pared to about 2100 under the
previous system. This is
possible because each student's
first choice is verified before
the computer begins to sort out
the second choice cards.

Burts admitted, however,
that the system is impersonal in
comparison to other methods of
registration. He also cited
several problems with the
present system and encouraged
students to think about ways to

improve it. Burts commented
that junior Steve Canterbury
was the originator of the
preference card idea.

Burts emphasized care while
filling out preference cards.
“We continue to ask students
and faculty to seek
prerequisites. What we're
Saying is, if there is an approval
required. don’t sign your name
until you're certain about it.”

He named two points which
cause problems most often.
Students and advisors both need
to be very careful about course
numbers and alpha numbers."
Burts said.

A student wastes one of his
preferences by making careless
errors such as putting down the
wrong alpha number or by
forgetting to put his name on his
preference cards.

Burts said that the computer
system has worked fairly well
since it was instituted five years
ago. Computer breakdowns
have sometimes caused _in-
conveniences, but they have not
resulted in any major delays.

He explained the two previous
systems used for student course
registration and gave reasons
why Davidson now uses
preference cards.

Freshmen retain the old
system when they register for
Fall classes. This procedure in-
volves establishing a ceiling for
each course, preparing the
preference cards in advance,
and handing them to depart-
ment chairmen.

The chairmen sit behind

tables in Chambers Banquet
Hall while students file by and
choose their courses. The line-
up is determined by a lottery.

Burts explained that the
value to this system was that
the student could ‘‘shop around
until he received three cards.”
Also. department chairmen
could inquire about necessary
prerequisites and could raise
the ceilings of courses when
needed. Students knew when
they walked out of the banquet
hall which courses they would
be taking.

However, the system limited
the preferences of a student
who chose a high lottery num-
ber, and was especially disad-

vantageous to freshmen.

The other method of
registration proved to be
unrealistically lengthy and

frustrating for both the student
and the registrar's office.

Every student was issued a
scanner card on which he filled
in his course choices. The com-
puter processed the cards and
ceilings were established af-
terwards.

Some students had to go
through two editing sessions
with the registrar's office
before his schedule was
finalized.

Also, there were a great num-
ber of careless errors, and
some students could not get the
hang of filling out the computer
scanner.

recommendations

Vice President for Acacemic
Attairs Joe Mo Bevan indicated
that although this policy was a
far cry from the original draft.
he was happy to have this for-
malized statement from the
faculty

This 1s an elaboration of the
system that already exists.”
said Bevan

The procedures emphasize
the place of the vice president
for academic affairs and the

department chairmen in
evaluating faculty _ per-
formance.

Committee on Professional

Affairs Chairman Max E
Polley indicated that this policy
is a formalized codification of
present practice.

“In recent years. the depart-
ment chairmen have been
assuming more authority in the
process of evaluating in-
dividual faculty members
within their respective depart-
ments,” Polley said.

“There was a time when the
administration did virtually
everything. This plan calls for
the department chairmen to
assume partial roles as ad-
ministrators,"’ he explained.

‘Although we feel that
evaluation of the faculty is
mainly an administrative duty.
we are willing to allow our
department chairmen to share
in that evaluation,”’ Polley ad-
ded.

“The chairman knows the
general field and brings a cer-
tain amount of expertise to the
evaluation process,’’ Polley
said.

A previous draft written by
the Committee on Professional
Affairs called for a committee
composed of faculty members
to evaluate the individual
faculty members. This plan was
almost unanimously rejected
by the faculty.

Professor of Philosophy Ear]
R. MacCormac was the
greatest supporter of that plan.

“Tenure is coming under at-

tack more and more as iti is seen
to be a system which allows
professors to hide’ and
vegetate. MacCormac ex-
plained

“We have a vested interest in
faculty tenure. I feel that only
through ensuring the per-
formance of our colleagues and
taking the responsibility for in-
dividual members to improve
their competence can the
tenure system be maintained.”
MacCormac said.

“However. I wish the faculty
had set up a small committee
dominated by faculty and the
vice president for academic af-
fairs to pass judgement on
tenure. promotion, and salary
situations.". MacCormac ex-
plained.

Polley explained that the
faculty rejected the previous
proposal because the faculty
members were hesitant to sit in
judgment of their colleagues.

Polley had certain reser-
vations about the present

_ procedure for evaluation of

faculty performance.

“My concern is that this
system puts a lot more work on
the department chairmen.”
Polley said.

President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. indicated that he had certain
reservations about the present
document. Spencer indicated
that he was wary of this plan as
ithada tendency to make depar-
tment chairmen administrative
officers.

“IT think faculty evaluation
should be a cooperative ven-
ture,’’ Spencer said.

“I think it has been too much
of an administrative procedure

in the past without enough
faculty imput.

The statement as written by
the Committee on Professional
Affairs will be initially taken to
the Board of Tustees to pass this
as a policy statement,” Spencer

_ Said.
