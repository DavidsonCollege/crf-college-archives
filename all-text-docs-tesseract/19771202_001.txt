Director of Student Hou-

sing Scotty Nicholls has an- -

nounced a tie in the recent
contest for ideas on conserving
energy in the residence halls.

Due to the essential simi-
larities between the top two
entries, the $25 cash prize was
divided between the winners,
Junior John Parkerson and
Senior Rick Miller who sub-
mitted a joint entry, and
Sophomore Anne Tutwiler.

Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze and
Business Manager Robert
Currie -assisted Nicholls with
the judging.

One common suggestion
was the installation of radiator
valves which would allow the
residents of each room to
control the amount of heat
they receive. At present many
students must resort to open-
ing windows to cool down a
room.

This problem has long been
under consideration and new
valves will be tried on an
experimental basis in selected
rooms this winter. As it
stands, the dorms are heated
on a rotating on-off basis.

If the use of valves proves
effective, however, students
can hope eventually to main-
tain their own temperature
preferences at a constant level.

In a positive response to the

idea of reducing light in the
dorm hallways, Meetze took
the opportunity to emphasize
that students’ input and reac-
tion is what determines the |

‘Faculty narrowly rejects

non-western requirement

By PAM CAMERRA
Staff Writer

The Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) submitted
in November a proposal to the
faculty which would have re-
quired students to take one
non-western studies course
during their years at David-
son. In a vote at the last
faculty meeting that proposal
was narrowly defeated.

The proposal originated
with a request in 1976 from the
President to the EPC to
examine various aspects of the
college curriculum and make a
report to the faculty. Part of

extent to which energy conser-
vation in extended.

As has been done in Cham-
bers and in the library, some
lights in areas not intended for
studying will simply be turned
off. :

Insulation to prevent waste-
ful loss of energy was another
idea expressed in the contest.
Meetze agrees that insulation
of pipes, walls and the attics
would be a substantial im-
provement.

Such a project, he points
out, necessitates a careful
consideration of total cost
versus projected savings.

One suggestion will soom be
acted upon. The tenfperature
of the water flowing to the
residence halls will be lowered,
thus reducing the amount of

heat expended to heat the
water.

Following, another sugges-
tion, Nicholls plans to distri-
bute information on appliance
wattages and power usage
inorder to increase student a-
wareness. Students are still
‘notoriously negligent” about
turning off lights.

Overall the contest results
encouraged the judges. They
express great hopes for further
student cooperation and in-
put.

Zimmermann shuns

By EMILY PARTIN
Staff Writer

In the past, the Curriculum
Requirements Committee
(CRC) has allowed students
who have accumulated extra
course credits to take a reduc-
ed course load, on the grounds
that they were ahead of norm-
al process.

This position was modified
at a November 9 committee
meeting. In a letter to stu-
dents who requested reduced
course loads for the winter
term, Registrar Richard C.
Burts, Jr., the Chairman of
the CRC, states, ‘Being ahead
of normal’ progress might be a’

factor, but it will no longer be
adequate by itself. Instead,
Committee approval will de-
pend on the adequacy of the
reasons presented by the stu-
dent for laying aside the
expectation that all sutdents
will carry a normal load of
three courses.”’

Burts feels that this change
in practice will not affect
students with valid reasons for
requesting a reduced load.
Sexeral students have, in fact,
been granted permission to
take a reduced load winter

term. ‘‘A students with a real
reasomewilk wo appre ved, DUt
now a student without any

real reason won’t be approv-

ed,’’ said Burts.

A number of students have
expressed the concern that
this change represents a shift
to a more paternalistic policy.
They feel that the College is
not recognizing that students
are capable of making mature
decisions for themselves.

Vice President of Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann ac-
knowleges that the new prac-
tice is somewhat paternalistic,
but he claims that this pater-
nalism is related to Davidson’s
academic structure and tradi-
tional ties.

. There is also some, digacrans

the original plan was to look at
the Honors College, Extended
Studies and South Asian Stu-
dies.

Professor of Religion Daniel
Rhodes, chairman of the sub-
committee that did the basic
research on South Asain Stu-
dies said ‘‘We discovered that
we could not look at Asian
Studies alone, but rather had
to decide whether students
should take something other
than merely courses in the
Judeo-Christian, GrecoRoman
tradition.’

After several months of
investigation the committee
recommended the non-western
studies requirement.

“The philosophy behind the
proposal,’’ said Rhodes,

‘“‘was that a liberally educated
student should be exposed in
some sort of formal way to at
least one culture other than his
own.”’ There are some eighteen
to twenty courses presently
offered that fit in the general
non-western category, inclu-
ding Buddhism, African For-
eign Policy, Chinese Poetry,
and Economics of South Asia.

Unlike the four other area
requirements (Religion and
Philosophy, the Social Sci-
ences, Natural Sciences and
English and Fine Arts) this
proposal would not have set
up a fifth area. For example,
Hinduism would have fulfilled
both a religion requirement
and the non-western studies
requirement.

The proposal was defeated
for a number of reasons.
Although faculty members
generally agreed that students
should be exposed to:other
cultures, they were divided on

whether or not non-western

studies should be made a
requirement. Rhodes said,
‘There were some faculty
members who were genuinely
reluctant to add any further

requirement for students,
since Davidson already dem-
ands a great deal in terms of

area requirements and courses
for majors.
Some professors were very

interested in students having
this kind of experience. They
felt, however, in light of the
large percentage of students
who now take a non-western
course before graduation, that
it was better psychologically
not to nut pressure on stu-
dents through more require-
ments.”

Professor of South Asian
Studies Tonia Devon, a lead-
ing proponent of the non-wes-
tern proposal, countered the
argument. She believes that it
is important for students to’be
exposed to the eastern tradit-
ion. Passing this proposal
would have assured that “all
students would have to take
at least one course dealing
with the other two-thirds of
the world.

Other opponents of the mo-
tion felt that a thorough
analysis of the overall curricu-
lum should be undertaken
before any more requirements
are added. Many faculty mem-
bers are concerned with the
difficulties entering students
have with English composi-
tion and grammar and are
wondering if there should not
be a re-examination of our
language requirements first.

Some faculty. members rea-
soned that Davidson already
has a large number of course
offerings and is doing as many
things as it can do well. They
feared. that there might be
pressure to increase the num-
ber of non-western courses, to
develop areas of study that are
not of primary importance, if
the proposal had been passed.

“It is very difficult to be
dogmatic about this issue,’’
said Rhodes. ‘“‘The EPC and |
tried to look at all the ques-
tions that could be raised by
such a policy. The vote was
close, which means that it
might be brought up again in
the future.”’

oO course plan

ment as to what constitutes an
“adequate reason” for a stu-
dent to take a reduced load.
Senior Clay Houchens took
two courses in summer school
at Davidson several years ago.
She applied for a reduced’ load
winter term, stating as’her
reason the fact that she was
two credits ahead. ‘It seems
like if a student’s ahead of
normal progress that should
be a sufficient reason,’’ Hou-
chens said.

_ Houchens received the letter
from Burts explaining the new
position of the CRC. She

describe what the commettee
would consider an ‘‘adequate”’
reason. She applied again,
stating preparation during the
winter term for a 401 course in
the spring involving both

GRE’s and a comprehensive
examination as her reason for
requesting a reduced load.

Houchens has been told by
Burts that she will be notified
of the Committee’s decision
next Tuesday. She will be
allowed to go through drop
add Tuesday if necessary.
