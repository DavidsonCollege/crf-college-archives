Wade Ison, enterprising sports editor
of the Charlotte afternoon paper, was
the conductor of the contest, and. was
eminently successful in his efforts.
Hundreds of Davilson alumni all over
the South voted in the contest, and
the team that was selected is probably
as representative a one~as could be
chosen.

Players-from 1907 on up until: the
present time were selected on the
team, Dr. DeWitt Kluttz, Washington,

N. C., being selected at an end from
the 1907 team, and Johnny Mackorell,
back on the present Davidson team,
leading the field in number, of votes
received,

Awards for the best selections were
made to Don McQueen, Laurel Hill,
S. C., and Harry A. Townsend, Blen-
heim, for selecting the largest number
of the final all-time team. McQueen
and Townsend got 10 out of the 11 cor-
rect.

Three teams were selected because
of the heavy voting. It was felt that
the other men should be recognized
since. they had so many~ supporters.

The first team was composed of:
End, Thad Brock, High Point; tackle,
Lawrence Hammett, Honea Path, S.
C.; guard, Billy Sayad, West Palm

Beach, Fla.; center, Buddy Gardner,
Decatur, Ga.; guard, Hugh Grey, Con-
cord; tackle, Tom Baker, Jacksonville,
Fla.; end, DeWitt Kluttz, Washington;
quarterback, John Mackorell, Hickory;
halfback, Buck Flowers, Atlanta, Ga.;
halfback, Dick Grey, New York; full-
back, Jack Black, Greenville, S. C..

Dr. Kluttz is the veteran of the first
eleven, having played at Davidson four
years from 1907 through 1910, while
Mackorell still has another year of
competition.

Mackorell polled the heaviest vote,
receiving ballots for all four backfield
positions and lacking but four votes of
tying for a halfback post. He received
an overwhelming majority for quarter-
back. Thad Brock was second in the
number of votes received and was re-

peatedly nominated for guard. Tom
Baker led in polling the most votes
for a single position and was closely
followed by Hammett.

Jim Morgan and Charlie Rives, pres-
ent Wildcat stars, landed berths along
with Coach Flake Laird on the second
team. Monk Younger, former David-
son coach, was also included on the
second eleven.

It is considered quite coincidental
that two brothers, Hugh Grey of the
class of '17, and Dick Grey, '27, were
placed on the first team. It is also in-
teresting to note that Dick Grey was
the only member of the Big Five
championship team of 1926 to larid on
the mythical all-time aggregation.

Former Coach Bill Fetzer’s 1916 and
1917 teams dominated the entire field,

placing three men each on the first
string. Bill Fetzer himself received a
backfield post on the third team,
