after each other.

Press on! Surmount the rocky steeps,
Climb bodily o'er the torrent’s arch;

Be thou a hero! Let thy might

He fails alone who feebly creeps,

He wins who dares the hero’s march,
Tramp on eternal snows its way,

And through the ebon walls of night
Thursday found the girl don’t rate.

Press on! If once and twice thy feet
Slip back and stumble, harder, try;
From him who never dreads to meet
Danger and death they're sure to fly.
To coward ranks the bullet speeds,
While on their breasts who never quail,
Gleams, guardian of chivalric deeds,
Bsight courage like a~coat of mail.
