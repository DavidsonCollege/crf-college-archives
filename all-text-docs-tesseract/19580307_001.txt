morrow to signify their. willing-

A major aspect of the

son gentleman is a good hair-cut.

On the day before ROTC drill
each week and for several days
before dance weekends and holi-
days one can see hordes of
students migrating to either
Hood Norton’s or Johnson’s bar-
ber shops for their beautifying
trims. Each of these shops is
traditional on the campus.

Hood Norton’s shop was
founded in 1908 as Norton

In 1908, there were but two

four chairs with he and his son
operating two of them. All four
of his barbers are registered in
the trade.

literary and historical introduc-
tion to the Bible with special)
emphasis upon the major
themes of Biblical revelation)

Only three sections of this
will be offered the fall semester
of 1958.

Students entering Bible 11S)

three hours from Bible 21, 22;|

Bible 14, “The Prophets,” is
a study of the prophetic litera-
ture of the Old Testament with
special attention upon the po-
litical and social contributions
of the times.

Bible 16, “The Wisdom Litera-

a study of the growth of He-

to the great abiding issues of
existence, suffering, and death
as presented in such books as
Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and
Solomon.

Bible 18, ‘“Post-Exilic Juda-

Judaism after the Baylonian
