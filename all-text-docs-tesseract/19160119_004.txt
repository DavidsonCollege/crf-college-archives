The DAVIDSONIAN, January 19, 1916

STUDENT BODY TABOOS
HAZING ALTOGETHER

At a student body meeting held im-
mediately before the Christmas holidays,
the Davidson student body passed the
following resolution, proposed by the
Student’s Council: “Resolved, That
snow:balling, water-throwing, dumping,
Fresh wetting, etc., be considered haz-
ing and treated as such.” The resolu-
tion was passed with practically a four-
to-one vote.

On nothing which has happened on
the campus in the last four years is the
student body to be more congratulated
than on the action which it took in this
instance. This action indicates that
Davidson men are giving thoughtful at-
tention to conditions on the campus and
aré making an honest effort to improve
them. It indicates that self-government
in the hands of an intelligent and con-
scientious student body bodv is the solu-
tion. of modern college difficulties. It
indicates that Davidson students are put-
ting away childish things and are be-
coming men.

It is probably in recognition of this
fact that the Faculty has decided to give
the three upper classes the privilege
which onlv Seniors have enjoyed hereto-
fore. This is the privilege of leaving the
campus without permission at any time
when their absence will not conflict with
college duties.

CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS
AS SPENT ON HILL

To the twenty men who spent the
Christmas holidays at the College it
proved to be one continual round of
pleasure. The townspeople were untir-
ing in their efforts to make the day pass
pleasantly, and as usual they succeeded.

Many visitors spent the holidays here.
among them Miss Mary Richards and
Miss Mildred Johnston, who were home
from Converse: and Misses Bertie
Christenbury, Susie Brady, Louise
Campbell, Mary Parks Grey and Char-
lotte Cranford, from the State Normal.
In addition, as the guests of Mr. and
Mrs. T. R: Withers, were Miss Mar-
garet Blythe, of the State Normal, and
Misses Flossie Harris and Lois Camp-
bell, of Salisbury. Visiting Mr. and
Mrs. Ed Lothrevy were the Misses
Jamison. of Charlotte. Miss Blakely,
of Charlotte, was the guest of Miss
Bonnie Shelton. As the guest of Miss
Mary Richards was Miss Eyrene Hud-
son. of Winthrop.

On the night of Wednesday, Decem-
ber 29, the students entertained in
honor of the visitors in the Social Cen-
ter. They were assisted by Mrs. W. J.
Martin and Mrs. W. R. Grey. Games.
music and charades made the evening
pass pleasantly, and as refreshments, ice
cream and cake were served. About
fortv guests were present,

The following evening Miss Mary
Richards entertained at her home with a
“tackv” party. Peppermint candy was
served as refreshments. The prizes were
won by Miss Sara Wooten, as a Colon-
ial maid, and Mr. J. E. Johnston, as a
Beau Brummel from the backwoods.
This was one of the most enjoyable
events of the season.

On New Year's Eye the usual “cele-
bration” was held on the cupola by the
students, using a diminutive cannon and
a Chinese cymbal as the noise-making
imnlements. The college bell rang the
Ol4 Year out and the New Year in.

The dormitories were closed, with the
exception of Georcia, and most of the
havs moved there for the holiday period.
A chess tournament lasted throughout
the time.
ne

Tt was with sincere regret that the
student bodv learned of the death of
Mr. C. S. Good. of Greenville, §. C.,
father of Fred Good ('16), on the aft-
ernoon of December 27.

MISS SHAW REMEMBERED AT
CHRISTMAS BY STUDENTS

In appreciation of the many kind-
nesses and courtesics extended by the
Librarian, Miss Cornelia Shaw, she was
presented Christmas with a dainty La
Valliere by the student body.

The following note has been received
from Miss Shaw:

Messrs. J. P. Williams and J. M. Black:

Gentlemen: I write to thank you
and through you my friends of the col-
lege for the beautiful Christmas gift.

In itself it is exquisite. IT shall wear
it with keenest pleasure and between
times keep it wrapped in loving mem-
ories of the men of 1915-16.

For the thought back of it, for the
trouble it represents, and for the dainty
La Valliere itself, IT think you from
my heart.

Hoping that the New Year will bring
to each of you the thing he wants most,
T am, Gratefully yours,

Cornelia Shaw.
