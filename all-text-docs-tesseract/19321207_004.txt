Davidson, Clemson,-Presbyterian,. Wofford,
Columbia Bible College, Limestone, and
Queens-Chicora all sent representatives.

Each college was. assigned a certain coun-
try, and its delegates represented it at the
meeting of the “League.” Davidson was as*
signed Germany and the Netherlands.

The delegates from Davdison were Dun-
can McBryde, Jake Mackorell, and Bill
|Ward. Duncan McBryde made the key
|speech for Germany, and he was ably as-
sisted by Bill Ward. Jake Mackorell gave
the views of the Netherlands, Davidson's
speeches were of a bit more informal na-
ture than the others. This caused favorable
comment frem the toastmaster at the ban-
quet that followed the meeting.

The subject of supreme importance before
the “League” was the trouble between Japan
and China the Manchuria territory:

on Germany's views on equality and arma-
ment. Quite a bit of zest was added to the
proceedings when: a delegate from Hungary
disagreed with McBryde's views, and Mce-
3ryde was forced to make a rathey biting
reply, in’ which play upon the word
“Hungary” nearly broke up the meeting.

From the story by John Wilstatch, this
picture furnishes a good vehicle for the very
marked ability’ of George Raft and judging
from his past performances he will portray
his role finely. Raft will be remembered
as the dangerous lover of “Searface” and
this time he.plays an even more dangerous
game. Nancy Carroll plays the feminine
lead; and these two stars are well supported
by Lew Cody, Roscoe. Karns and Noel
Francis.

Marie Dreisler makes this rather crude
fable by Sylvia Thalberg human, interest-
ing and amusing.

Maggie Warren (Marie Dreisler) turns
over the bank, which she has run for sev-
eral years, to her son 6n his wedding day.
Young John Warren lacks the wisdom that
his mother had and as a result when his
mother-in-law (Polly Moran) starts a run
on the bank he is unable to meet the de-
mands of the depositors and the bank closes.
Then follow the series of incidents in which
Dreisler does her best acting, one of these

Saturday, Dec. 10~—Congorilla—( Fox)

Perhaps this is not the best animal pic-
ture that has been produced, but beyond
question it is the most interesting. A notable
feature of this natural study of Africa made
by the Martin Johnsons is the sound record-
ing both of animals and of pygmies. More
than any~of the recent African films this
picture furnishes a precise and amusing
study of the pygmies.

was an old Indian sport held by the tribes
to welcome friends, and climaxed the series
of the day’s events. It is just as exciting as
pictured by the author, Mark Twain.

It seemed the more noise people made the
more the frogs jumped and they had every
reason if this was true because some of the
spectators became as excited over the race
as the savages of old.

Coming down the mountain that night to

impressive sight and we stopped at one point
and silently watched, for some time before
continuing the descent.

A graduate of Davidson and of Union studying abroad writes:

“There are able scholars here whose books*are known and read
all over the religious world. None of them can surpass some of our
professors at Union as teachers, and none of them can challenge a
student to joyous, practical Christianity as did-our professors there.”
