Students Will Not Speak
At Graduation Exercises

There will be no student

speakers at commencement

this year, Dean Frontis W. Johnston admitted to THE
DAVIDSONIAN this week. The news came as a surprise
in the latest developments for graduation exercises.

The faculty voted several
weeks ago to eliminate this
part of the program, Johnston
said. The move was mace to
shorten the exercises. There
was even talk of cutting out the
regular commenecment address
too, sometime in the next few
years.

“This is no radical depar-
ture,”. Johnston said. “It is
part of a general trend.”

The dean also commented
that few student speeches at
commencement have really
been valedictories. Most stu-
dents don't seem to know what
type of address they should
give, he explained.

Other plans continued this
week for the commencement
program. The ROTC department
furnished details on the com-
missioning exercises, and the
Senior Class Day Committee
moved forward on its plans.

Eighty graduating David-
son cadets will be commis-
sioned at 3 p.m. Saturday,
May 27, 1961, as second lieu-
tenants in the U. S. Army.

Actors To Audition
For Prof. Sneden

John Aitken Sneden, Jr., head
of the new Drama Department,
will visit the campus this Tues-
day in an effort to get an idea
of the student talent he will be
working with next year.

Sneden will hear interested
students read at 4 p.m. Tuesday
in the theater of the new Cun-
ningham Fine Arts Building.
The text will be Hamlet’s second
soliloquy at the end of Act II.

One reason Sneden is inter-
ested in finding studehts with
the ability to act is because he
will be directing a play in the
fall for the opening of the fine
arts building. Although he has
visited the campus on other oc-
casions in conjunction with
Vagabond productions, Sneden

wanted a chance to become fam-|

iliar with all prospective actors.

DAVIDSONIAN “alumni” Lau-
rens Walker, “B” Millner, and
Ervin Duggan have been select-
ed to work in conjunction with
The Wall Street Journal News-
paper Fund this summer.

The Walt Street Journal in
cooperation with several other
leading newspapers around the
country provides journalism
jobs for students during the
summer. The students receive
regular salaries from these
newspapers, and if at the end of
the summer, their work is found
to be satisfactory they are
awarded a $500 scholarship. The
scholarship may be applied to
any course of study.

Our ‘Alu

son, ‘29, will be the speaker
for the commissioning exer-
cises.

Four Cadets, Quinton Boyd,
Don Harper, Jim Ratchford,
and T. Redding, will receive
commissions into the Regular
Army. The other 76 will re-
ceive commissions in the Army
Reserve.

Following the address by
King, the cadets will take the
oath of office, which will be
given by Lt. Col. W. L. Adams,
Jr. Brigadier General Kenneth
A. McCrimmon, from Fort
Bragg will then present the
commissions. The 440th Army
Band from Fort Bragg wil! sup-
ply music for. the occasion.

Ben Sparks, head of the Sen-
ior Class Day Committee, said
that program will also be held
Saturday the 27th. “We invite
any member of the senior class
and faculty to feel welcome to
come.” He promised that this
year’s program would not take
the aspect of a side show.

Rush Rules
For Fall —

Bob Waugh, president of
the 1961-62 Interfraternity
Council, has announced the
rush regulations for the fall
of 1961. These, he said, are
virtually the same as last
year, the main difference
being that classes will be
held during rush, making
the schedule even more hec-
ic.

Beginnwig Aug. 15, such
formal rush materials as‘ pam-
phlets, official letters, and date
cards may be sent out. None
will be allowed before this date
although informal letters from
individuals will be acceptable
throughout the summer.

Saturday, Sept. 9, an inform-
al tea will be held at the
Union to give the incoming
freshmen a chance to speak in-
dividually to independents about
fraternities. A period of silence
will be in effect from 11 p.m.
Sunday . until confirmation dur-
ing Monday chapel. At this
time the rushees will determine
the parties they will attend for
the first three days.

As last year, three parties will
be held on each of the first
three days. On Thursday, Sept.
13, re-dates will be distributed
through the IFC. A second per-
iod of silence will occur from
11 p.m. Wednesday to 10 am.
Thursday when confirmation of
re-dates will be held, followed
by two sets of three parties
each which will take place
Thursday and Friday.

Concerning the gentlemen's
agreement to limit dorm room
visits to 15 minutes, Waugh said
that he “hoped it would be ob-
served better next fall.” He stat-
ed that if it comes down to
brass tacks the IFC will not hes-
itate to make it a regulation.

a Presbyterian minister in the
church's Leopoldville station,
has been living in New Jersey

are returning to Africa this

jsummer, and are investigating

colleges for Nsuba.

“B” Millner, 1960-61 editor of
THE DAVIDSONIAN, will be
working with The Charlotte Ob-
server as a reporter. Millner
chose to work with the Observ-
er so that he can be close to
his home in Concord.

Ervin Duggan, 1960-61 asso-
ciate editor of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, has completed negotiations
to work with THE WASHING-
TON POST, as a reporter this

summer and continuing into the
fall if he desires.

Duggan has already turned
down an offer with an Augusta
newspaper.

Annual cadet awards and the

[spring tapping of Scabbard and

Blade, honorary military frater-
nity, highlighted the final ROTC

Two seniors and five juniors
were admitted into the honor-
ary group. Quinton Boyd and
Bob Cook were the MS IV’s.
Juniors tapped were Randy Aus-
tin, Ed Grimsley, Duncan Mort-
on, Phil Patrick and Bob Stone.

explained to the committee
that there were a number of
problems involved though.

According to the trustees’ ae-
tion: the Congolese student
must be recommended by the
Board of Missions. President
Martin feels this could ‘be
achieved. The Board is being
notified of this case.

Other possible problems are
in the matter of finance and
of Nsuba's qualifications. The
Board has probably used its
available funds in supporting
the 10 students it assigned in
Switzerland and the U.S.

Nsuba attended school for
nine years in the Congo and the
current year in New Jersey.
The college is not yet sure if
he would be qualified to begin
college work next fall.

Critic Terms New Annual
‘A Vast Artistic Success’

“We too, are not everything
for every man.”

“ ... Look for something
here that for four yeers or
one has been you.”

— 1961 Quips and Cranks

The 1961 Quips and Cranks is
a vast artistic success that will
be neither liked nor understood
by every student. Like the col-
lege, it is not everything for
every man. But for the ones
who are willing to look, there
is plenty to find.

Photographed by Editor Char-
lie Rose, and written about by
Larry H. Smith, Davidson Col-
lege is trapped on paper with
honesty and poetry.

This annual is a book. It
tells a story. It was not made
to be thumbed through. Un-
der a cursory glance it disin-
tegrates, but when read two
or three times it becomes a
poetic analysis of a school.
We would humbly prescribe

a method of approach for this
book. Look at the pictures first.
Find yourself, your fraternity,
find your sport. Then go back
and read it — —from beginning
to end, cover-to-cover.

Then finally, go to the core
of the book. Read the class
sections as a_unit; skip the ma-
terial in between. There runs
through the class sections a
fine, fragile line of continuity
that is easily broken if the read-
er does not look for it, find it,
and focus his attention upon it.
Then read “The Girl,” and “The
Students” and the closing poetic

essay.
From purely a technical stand-
point, the 1961 Quips and

Cranks is near-perfect. Rose .be-
comes a deft artist when he has
a camera in his hand. The lay-
out is modern and daring. The
typography is bold and exquis-
ite at just the right moments.
Artisticatly, there is excel-
lence and two blemishes.
Smith’s prose-poetry, brilliant
in places, in other places is a
trifle too high-flown, a little
too obscure. An unfortunate
plecing of the sections de-
stroys some of the continuity

in the core of the book.

This Quips and Cranks breaks
long-established traditions in
Davidson annuals. There are no
individual portraits in the fra-
ternity section. There. is no
beauty section. Many will be
disappointed.

This annual has been con-
structed painstakingly. In it
there is not everything for
every man. But for the ones
who are willing to look, there
is plenty to find,
