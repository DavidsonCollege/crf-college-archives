Infant Honors College
Searches For Its Niche

“The Davidson Honors Col-
lege is still feeling its way in
providing a channel for pursuit
of independent and individual
study beyond the regular cur-
riculum,” said Honors College
Dean Frontis W. Johnston this
week.

“The program is still wide
open and flexible. We want to
give a place to the student with
a special interest or talent,” re-
marked Johnston.

The main obstacle to expan-
sion of the program, according
to Johnston, is the limited fac-
ulty of the Honors College. ‘‘.t's
not that our five professors are
terribly overworked, but that
they don’t represent enough dis-
ciplines,"’ he said.

‘‘We have had to turn down
many boys whose projects were
satisfactory and whose abilities
we didn’t question because our
faculty couldn’t help them,”
added Dean Johnston.

must present an educational

the Honors College faculty ‘who

the project and the educational
interests of the student,” said
Johnston.

Johnston said students may
apply before any term, although
applications before the spring
term are discouraged. He add
ed the Honors College would
schedule interviews this spring
in April before registration for
next fall.

Johnston admitted that appli-
cants are expected to tailor

Siudents in the Honors Col-
lege all agree that it is an ex-
cellent program for them per-
sonally, but the agreement stops
there.

The flexibility of the Honors
Colldge in relation to the regu-
lar college is the main reason
for this praise of the program.

Senior Bill Beckman, who is
working in math and topology,
said, ‘One of the best things it
can do is leave you alone, and
it has done a lot of that.”

Another senior, Jack Scott,
echoed Beckman's sentiments.
“It worked, out perfectly for
me. It gave me the flexibility I
needed last year in Germany to
study the theater by allowing
me to travel.” .

Discontent with the system
starts with the question of flex-
ibility and branches into admis-
sions procedure, grading sys-
tem, arid an apparent diversity
of. opinion among the Honors
College staff concerning the gen-
eral philosophy of the prgram.

fessors in the program. | This
isn’t a written requirement, but
we assume it makes some sense
to use the Honors College facul-
ty, provided we can get some
morc professors,’ he said.

No minimum grade point av-
erage is required for admis-
Sion, according to Johnston. ‘‘We
look at the applicant's tran-
script, but we've taken boys
with F’s in courses at David-
son,” he remarked.

Incoming freshmen are not
usually admitted to the Honors
College, Jchnston said. ‘‘Most
freshmen don't have any ides of
what can and can’t be done
within the regular curriculum.
Several have been admitted in
the winter term of their fresh-
man year, however," he added.

One goal of the Honors Col-
lege set by the Blue Sky Com-
mittee was to “lift learning
throughout the college.’ .olin-
Ston admitted the need to “‘in-
crease the program's concrete
impact on the total academic
coinmunity.

“We don’t want the Honors
College to be an elite group
separate from the college. I
think we should do work to in-
crease the tangible benefits for
students in the regular pro.
gram,” Johnston said.

Evaluation for members of the
program remains a_ problem.
Grades of fail, pass and honors
are given, but Johnston
feels these need to he pinned
down. ‘Personally I think we
should put evaluation in moe
definable channels.”

Each member is assigned an
advisor from the Honors Col-
lege faculty, although this pro-
fessor need not be in the stu-
dent’s field of interest, Johnston
said.

Johnston disapproves of stu
dents using professors outside
the Honors College faculty as

The ‘honors, pass, fail” grad-
ing system of the college was
attacked by some students, but
seems to be a minor complaint.

Major discontent among Hon-
ors College members is aroused
by discrepancies and a seeming
lack of direction within the
structure of the college.

Admissions procedure was cit-
ed by Junior Bob Edmunds as
an example of discrepancy in
the system. ‘One guy will get
in with a mediocre program and
mediocre grades while another
guy with a super program is
turned down. There doesn’t seem
to be any set procedure for ad-
mitting or rejecting students,
and applications are going down
pecause of this arbitrary nature
of admissions procedure.”

Edmunds elaborated by say-
ing, “The faculty are having dif-
ficulty in conceiving a philogo-
phy of the Honors College. One
minute they want to be a tight
knit group with interdisciplinary
courses, and the mext they are
talking about more student free-
dom.”

Senior Danny Clodfelter agrees

advisors. ‘I am reluctant to ask
professors who are carrying a
full load to help a student with
an independent project. Often
this can take as much time as
a class,” he remarked.

Johnston said the same prob-
lem discourages expansion of
the departmental honors pro-
gram. ‘No department has the
staff to support a two-year in-
dependent study program,” he
said.

“Student performance and op-
eration of the program have
been 90 per cent successful so
far. Now we need to concen-
trate on expanding our faculty
and disciplines, and on increas-
ing our impact on the entire
college community,” Johnston
concluded.

Asked to analyse the function
and performance of the Honors
College, several of the Honors
College faculty presented strik-
ingly similar observations.

One recurring comment was
that the purpose of the Honors
College and its relationship to
the rest of the college have not
been clearly defined. Dean of
the Honors College Frontis John-
ston admitted that a clear-cut
definition of the purpose has
not evolved, but stated that
this was a natural result of the
flexibility against the confines
of a narrow program.

Robert Avinger, honars. college
and economics professor, said,
“The program is still young
and its focus is somewhat un-
certain. We are trying to pro-
vide a flexible program for stu-

with Edmunds that the faculty
needs to define their concepts
and goals more clearly, but he,
along with several others, tied
most of the Honors College’s
ills to understaffing.

Clodfelter said, ‘You need full
time men. When a _ professor
works half-time at the Honors
College and half-time at the reg-
ular college, he is lost to both
places.”

Lanny Ackiss, who left the
program due to a change in
subject interest carried C'od-
felter’s statement further.

“You have to study under an
Honors College professor, and
since there aren’t enough pro-
fesssors, the possible areas of
study are severely restricted.”

Some students, like Steve Sal-
yer, who is studying the effects
of population growth, think that
‘Most of what’s done in the
Honors College should be cone
in the regular curricuium so
that the Honors College program
can be offered to all students.”’

On the other hand, Junior
Gray Wilson said, ‘It should be
harder to get in, a lot of people

dents with specific interests
who could profit from the Hon-
ors College, but we need to de-
fine our relationship with the
rest of the college.”

John M. Bevan, vice presi-
dent for academic affairs, and
another teacher in the Honors
College, said that the concept
of allowing the student to plan
most of his own. program is
good. He emphasized, however
that the Honors College should
serve only those who can not
find what they want in regular
departmental honors.

Avinger emphasized that the
Honors College is not intended
to teach a program of study
available in the regular curri-
culum, and is not meant to be
used by students just to escape
distribution requirements. John-
ston expressed the same con-
cern, saying, ‘‘We’re interested

in the Honors College are just
sophisticated goldbricks and
these few have given the whole
setup a bad name.”

According to Salyer, the Hon-
ors College is not taking a dy-
namic part in general college
life. He feels it should be a
forerunner of a general college
program, it should not be as
isolated an institution as he
thinks it is presently.

Junior Alan Baragona sees a
lack of leadership as 4 cause
of the college’s non-dynamic na-
ture. ‘“‘Nobody has fired the
Honors College, there has been
a lack of imagination in its de-
velopment. It's stagnant.”

Individually, everyone seems
happy with what Davidson’s ex-
perimental education program
has done for them. This seems
to be because the program, after
being selected into it, has left
them to do whatever they want.
But, even though they are not

in the student who wants to get
into, rather than out of some-
thing.” }

Professor Earl MacCormac,
spoke to the problem of relat-
ing the Honors College to the
entire community and said, ‘“‘If
the Honors College doesn’t pro-
vide a service, then it has no
right to exist.”

Johnston suggested that the
Honors College benefits the en-
tire college most directly
through its symposia and lec-
tures.

“T hope we-can develop a
structure which will allow more
exposure to the community. Of
course, idealistically we hope
that the enthusiasm of the Hon-
ors College students will rub
off on others, which would be
an indirect benefit,” Locke
White, physics professor, said.

White emphasized another re-
iterated comment. ‘“‘We need
more unity and co-operation in
the program, but I don’t know
how to get it. By comparison
to other such programs, we need
to find a better way to get a
community of experience.”

Johnston agreed that commun-
ity is lacking, and related the
problems to the program’s em-
phasis on freedom and_inde-
pendent study. “We have to
strike a balance between hav-
ing no community consciousness
and being an elitist group cut
off: from the college.”

In regard to future changes
in the Honors College opinion
varied. Bevan suggested that —
the program be expanded to in-
clude five full-time faculty mem-
bers and about 75 students. He
also would prefer that students
be admitted into the program
earlier, particularly..as_ fresh-
men.

Avinger agreed that the pro-
gram should be expanded to
include between 50 and 100 stu-
dents, but recommended that
more part-time professors would
broaden the number of fields of-
fered and attract more students.
He also advocated allowing stu-
dents to spend just one or two
terms in the Honors College,
rather than three or four years.
