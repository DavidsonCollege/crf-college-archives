It is always along
about this time ef year.
when all the regular
Varsity seasons are over
and usually forgotten,
that: everyone gets the
*‘clean-slate—new-leaf”
feeling which usually
allows all- good David-
sonians to leave school
with the idea that, after
all, September begins a
new year in which
things will be entirely
different, and it is just
possible that the Wild-
cats will have a win-
ning season in football,
basketball, baseball, etc. However. anybody who takes more than
the customary ten seconds to analyze the situation will soon see
that there are no brave new worlds forthcoming for Davidson
in the next few months.

Ie was a Persian gentleman named Omar Khayyam.
we believe. who between draughts from an omnipresent
jug of wine uttered sage bits of verse, one of which went
like this: “Yesterday This Day’s Madness did prepare
Tomorrow's Silence. Triumph. or Despair . . .”” In those
few words the present Davidson sports scene is summed up.

Davidson athletics in 1952-'53 will be largely what they
were this year. Most of the participants will be the same as they
were in '51-'52, and the situations under which they play will
have changed but little if at all. The same major problems will
confront the powers that be, and without doubt they will take
the same attitude.

Davidson with a new coach, a good coach who has
proved himself capable of winning tf given half a chance.
will spend $25,000 on football in 1952. Its football team
will take the field against schools which spend from
$40,000 to $83.000 and even above that figure. It seems
hardly necessary to point out the futility of such a proce-
dure; but when the kickoff of the first game comes around
the Wildcat supporters will still be out hoping for a just-
possible upset—as they, of course, should do.

In basketball the situation doesn’t look nearly as black but
neither is it bright. Most of the regulars on Boyd Baird's '51-'52
squad are graduating, and as is well known, Davidson doesn’t
appropriate a whole lot of money for scholarships in the hoop
sports either. The same applies to baseball. Dave Poole did the
best he could with what he had, but not enough of the real ma-
terial was there.

What it all comes down to in the final analysis is that
Davidson at present has only three workable alternatives if it is
* going to play the game and play it right (i.e.. win): 1) Devote
more money to the subsidization program; 2) lower scholastic
standards and get more of the less bright athletes who almost
made the big schools; 3) drop football, basketball, and baseball
entirely.

Of course it goes without saying that nobody—faculty,
students, or alumni-—would want to take either of the
two latter recourses, and it seems obvious that more money
for athletic scholarships is not forthcoming. So where does
that leave us? You're right. Exactly where we are.

It is said that the powers that be (Headquarters, South Wing
of Chambers Building) are hoping that the trend toward more
and more subsidization is slowing down, and that in the near
fature schools like Davidson can play the game as it should be
played—merely for the fun of playing. But until that day comes,
it’s going to be pretty painful for the athletes who have to play
the games and the spectators who will watch them.

A weakened Wildcat golf team
is in Winston-Salem this weekend
for the Southern Conference
tournament at the long Old Town
Country Club course.

Mac McLean.and Al Fitzgerald,
two of Coach Elgin White's most
dependable lin'ismen, did not make
the trip because of. important
scholastic work impending.

Members of the team to make
the trip were Graeme Keith,

Jim Sloan, Lou Barnes, Bob

Brannon, with Al Gaither and

Ed Douglass filling in for Mc-

Lean and Fitzgerald.

The team capped off the regular
season match play by downing
U.S.C. a little over a week. ago.
This gave the Cats a 4-4 won-lost
record in conference play and‘a 5-4
record in matches played other than
on the Florida trip. Two of the four
lost matches were by a margin of
three points or less, and one of
the Cat wins was a hard-fought
one-point victory over N. C. State,

Although the absence of Fitz-

Wildcat of the Week . .

Bob Brannon

By DICK LILES

A 68 on a review or writ is
known to be not too good here at
‘Davidson, but that score on the
golf links is nothing to be sneezed
at and something that even comes
hard for the pros sometimes. How-
ever, a young Charlottean on Coach
Elgin White's golf team accom-
plished that feat in their last match
against South Carolina and very
much aided the Davidson cause in

the rout of the Gamecocks, 19% |:

to 17%.

Bobby is no stranger to the
wide fairwaye and putting
greens and although only in his
sophomore year here at school
he has already made his name
on the links. He started his
golfing career at the ripe age of
eleven years and has been
playing continuously ever since
then on his home Myers Park
Country Club course or visiting
some other location for a school
match or some tournament.

High Star

While in high school, Brannan
made quite a mame for himself on
the Central High School team and
while playing on his own hook in
the various junior and high school
tournaments. In three years as No.
2 man on the team, Central lost
only two golf matches. They won
the state tourney his last year in
high school.

Teaming up with Bobby Sisk,
who is still at Charlotte Central,
and playing No. One spot, Bob
helped win the Carolina's 4-Ball
Tournament two years ago, which
was his greatest honor. Then they
went on to set a record that still
stands for the Kiwanis Club Tour-
ney that is played every year in
North and South Carolina and in-
cludes both high school and junior
stars.

Eight Davidson Thinclads

in At Conference Track Meet

By JOHN HANDLEY

Eight members of Coach Pete Whittle’s track team were on
hand in Chapel Hill this morning for the Southern Conference

tournament today and Saturday.

Men making the trip were Bill
McNeely, Frank Cenegy, Frank
Mitchener, Bill Shipley, Bill Rus-
sell, J. V. Howell, Bob Turk and
Bob Henry.

The preliminary trials for the
shot, discus, 100 and 440 were
run off today with McNeely
and Cenegy, Mitchener, and
Shipley, respectively in the
above events, in the action.

The finals in all events will be

held tomorow with those Cats not

eliminated today and the mite re-
lay team competing for the Red
and Black. The relay team is com-
posed of Shipley, Howell, Russell,
and Henry.

Last weekend a crippled Cat
squad was overpowered by a strong
State Wolfpack team in Raleigh by
an 85 to 46 margin. Out of the
action were Bill Shipley, Dan
landers, and Bob Voston. All of
these men had proved to be re-
liable point-ygettgrs throughout the
season and Coach Whittle feels. that
the. Cats’ chances would be much
better had he been able to use these
three men.

In the State meet the Wildcats
were able to capture only four
firsts and 19 total places. The first

positions were taken by Bill Mc-

Neely with a 4 5%” put of the shot,
J. V. Howell with a 52.1 time in
the 440, Frank Mitchener with a
23.2 running in the 220, and Roy
White with a 20° 4” jump in the
broad jump.

With the regular season com-
pleted and the individual point
totals compiled, big Bill Me-
Neely walked away with the
individual scoring honors by
compiling a grand total of $1
points over the eix meets in
which he participated.

Versatile Jim Fickeisen was

second in line with 39 points, while
distance-man Tom Stockton placed
fourth with 38, next were Bob
Henry and Frank Mitchener with
36, and Rill Shipley with 35.
“ Coach Pete Whittle commented
this week thar all in all it has been
a very successful season, and a fine
squad is expected for next year.

Although the. men mentioned
above were the most valuable to
the team in view of their point com-
Whittle was quick to
praise all members of the team for
their help toward making a win-
ning season possible.
