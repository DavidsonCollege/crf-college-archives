THE COMING PLAGUE,

A malady is sweeping over the South,
gradually extending Northward. It has
recently reached Davidson, and a few
have dlready fallen: victims to it. A
strange disease this is, very contagious,
and one which no drug or antitoxine has
been found to cure. Its symptoms are
characteristic. The victim surveys the
work that has piled upon him, whistles
at the cnormousness of it, and sets him-
self to work it off. But somehow a
strange feeling of weariness comes over’
him. He looks out of his window. Out-
side the sun is shining brightly, balmy
breezes are shaking the newly born
leaves, the green grass speaks eloquently
of fragrant coolness, while the buzzing
of insects and the singing of birds blend
with the clink of horseshoes. The vic-
tim becomes conscious of a great desire
for the campus in preference to his dull
room. Then indifference is added to
weariness. What matters it if the tickets
are not studied? What tho all the work
of the year should be lost by indifference
now? The student is tired, his brain
will not work, he thinks possibly he has
a headache, he needs fresh air and rest
and must have it. Therewith he rises.
throws down his books, and goes out,
only to return after mail time, muttering
vicious ejaculations for wasting an after-
noon. No wonder doctors are baffled
when confronted by this strange mal-
ady. There is no cure for Spring Fever.
for such is its name, but there is a pre-
ventive—Will. It is he who can sit and
make himself work while all Nature is
calling him and desire to quit is savagely
attacking him body and mind, it is he.
even more than the star in base ball and
track, who is the true college hero.

"Reserves and Their Protection.”

Much interest is being taken in the
Junior-Senior debate preliminaries which
will be held tonight in the respective
society halls,

The query for debate is: ‘Resolved.
That an amendment should be made to
the Federal Constitution, forbidding the
sale of intoxicating liquors in the United
States.”

As a result of the preliminaries tonight
three men will be selected from each so-
ciety to compete in Shearer Hall for the
Intersociety Debating Cup and the med-
als given the best debater in each society.
The date for the finals has not been
definitely decided. Those debating to-
night are:
Perry, Sdgerton and Dumas in the Eu-
menean society, and Ratchford, Ormand,
McLeod, MacDonald and Clary, in the
Philanthropic.

LECTURES FOR THIS MONTH.

The two remaining lectures of the
series secured by the faculty will be

NEW WATER MAIN.

During the past few days a corps of
men has been at work under Mr. J. M.
Hill laving the new four-inch — water
main. The first eight hundred feet of
the line, leading from the pumping. sta-
tion to the wooded corner southeast of
Georgia, has been practically completed.
Near this point a large stand-pipe will
he erected. The main will be laid from
the stand-pipe to Chambers building, to
the Chemical Laboratory, and to the site
of the proposed new gymnasium. In all,
about two thousand feet of piping will
be put down within a short time. Hy-
drants will be placed wherever they are
needed for fire protection.
