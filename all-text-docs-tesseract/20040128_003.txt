within two weeks of notification.

Currently Summit Coffee is also consider-
ing CatCard acceptance.

Since Summit is an independent small busi-
ness, it does not have to go through a corporate
bureaucracy like CVS does to get permission.
It simply has to decide whether CatCard ac-
cess is beneficial for the business.

According to the SGA, if business goes well
for CVS and Summit Coffee, CatCard accep-

ge cS e Pe
tance could also be expanded
to Ben and Jerry’s and the
Brickhouse.

they can pay with their
CatCard account.

On a more musical
note, McQuillen wants to study the healing ef-
fects of the harp and harp therapy in Paraguay
and Ireland.

“While studying with local musicians, you

get more of the culture. The people are more
passionate about their culture in these two coun-
tries. The harp is an integral part of their mu-
sic,” said McQuillen.

Drawing from her experiences with music,
Fuhr desires “to find out whether in specific
instances music can make a difference in eth-

The nominees were interviewed by a repre-

await the results which will be released on

ranging from neurology to being a vice presi-
dent of Wellington Management Company.

Senators
reopen debate
on pass/fail

By BLaik McGraw
Senior Staff Writer

Reforming the college’s current pass/fail
policy was the topic of discussion at last
Thursday’s meeting of the student government.

Andy Agcaoili 07, freshmen class president
and head of the SGA’s Academic Affairs Com-
mittee, presented a resolution to give students
more time to make a decision when it comes to
pass/fail.

One of the SGA’s six main goals for this
year’s administration was the reevaluation of
the current pass/fail policy. The Thursday reso-
lution contained two options that will be sent
to the Educational Policy Committee once the
SGA passes the resolution.

The first option currently “proposes that the
pass/fail deadline be extended two weeks” from
its current deadline. By this time, students
would likely have received the first grade in
the course, thus helping “the students evaluate
their future progress in the particular course.”

The second option would keep the initial
pass/fail deadline the same as it is now. The
resolution originally proposed a two-week
period during which students would have the
opportunity to withdraw their pass/fail deci-
sion. The withdrawal of the decision forfeits
the option for that semester.

SGA President Charles Washington ’04 told
the SGA he thought the second option “does
the job just as well.”

Jeff Larrimore ’04 suggested that the with-
drawal deadline be pushed to Reading Day.
There seemed to be concurrence from the other
senators, as some suggested that if students

‘have the option to withdraw pass/fail, they

would work harder to reacha grade that’s within
reach.

“A lot of kids would work harder for the GPA
boost if they can get it,” said Elizabeth Redpath
04. .

Agcaoili said that in researching similar
schools to Davidson, “‘a lot of their policies were
easier than ours.”

The resolution is still likely to be tinkered
with, as the SGA will continue discussion of
the topic next week.

In other business, the SGA addressed some
minor changes to its bylaws. A November
election had taken place in which students voted
to approve reducing the number of Union Board
vice-presidents from two to one. The decision
was delayed over confusing wording on the. ,
ballot.

The Senate Court decided that “I choose to
cast no vote” does not count as an official vote,
and thus the change passed with the needed
two-thirds majority.

It was also decided that in future freshmen
senator elections, a picture and short descrip-
tion will accompany the ballots, as freshmen
may be more unfamiliar with their fellow class-
mates.
