Drive Renewed
For Beer Permit

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

The sale-of-beer-on-campus is-
sue is once again alive. The
most recent drive for a beer
permit died last October with-
is) the catacombs of the admin-
istration.

At that time College Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr. re-
leased this statement of his po-
sition:

“The Code of Responsibility
leaves the individual free to
make his own decisions about
the use of alcoholic beverages.
... Beer and wines are readily
available. Under the present
circumstances Bevan, Dean Ter-
ry and I do not consider it nec-
essary or desirable for the col-
lege to sell alcoholic bever.
ages."

Spencer’s position has sot
changed in the enusing months,
and this week he reaffirmed it.
He also added that he feels the
sule of beer cn campus would
give additional ammunition to
those already alarmed about
the changes at Davidson in re.
cent years. Spencer sees it ‘as
unother cause of alienation of
the alumni.”

Leading the drive for beer are
Student Body President Ralph
Peeples and Union President
Stanley Hassinger. Peeples says
he understands Spencer’s posi-
tion but disagrees with his feel-
ings about the alumni.

“I sometimes get the feeling
that a single letter of protest
from am alumnus carries more
weight around here than a reso-
lution from the Senate or a peti-
tion of student suport,” he sald.
“I think this issue deserves at-
tention and should be seriously
considered.”

Hassinger sees the sale of
beer ‘‘as the kind of thing which
would naw needed traffic to
the Guest House.” The Guest
House will become the union
next year when the present one
is demolished.

If the union did get a beer
permit a ratskeller has been

proposed. In it beer would be
sold at as low a price as pos-
sible and a slight profit would
be used to provide live enter-
tainment.

Terry is one of those who
agree in principle to the sale of
beer and the ratskeller idea.
“It’s the kind of place that stu-
dents could gather informally
and would do a great deal to
serve the community,” he said.
Terry agrees, however, with
Spencer's position, and added
“the college can't afford to
thumb its nose at the people
who supply the money.”

As it stands now there is little
chance for beer to be sold on
campus next year. Even in the
event that Spencer did give his
approval, the trustees must also
consider the issue.

Senate Receives Assessment
Of Coeducation Prospects

By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

The Senate received a report
Monday might on the status of
coeducation at Davidson, pre-
sented by Senator Bo Phillips,
which indicated that the pros-
pects next year for up to 135
girls looked good.

Phillips reported that H. Ed-
munds White has already sent
out letters to over 100 girls who
have contacted him, urging them
to apply to Davidson before
May 5 in anticipation of favor-
able action by the trustees on
the Educational! Policy Commit.
tee’s Coeducation Report.

White had previously told Phil.
lips that he had been assured
of adequate housing for 100 girls
over and above the 35 already
admitted to the consortium.

White expressed amazement
when informed that only one
Noor of Little had been reserv-
ed for possible coed use.

Ralpb Peeples announced that
he would chair a sub-committee
to look into all changes that
will be necessary with 100 girls
attending Davidson. He express-
ed hopes that this committee
action would show that students
are involved already in paving
4 smooth road for the advent
of coeducation.

SEAT

ay 4th

The traditional Trustee’s Tea
will be held next Thursday night
and Peeples urged all senators
to attend and show the Trustees
their commitment to coeduca-
tion before Friday’s vote on the
Coeducation Report.

In other action, the Senate
passed 10-2 a resolution pre-
sented by Skip Holcombe for
the Grievance Committee ask-
ing that the faculty be urged to
change its present by-laws which
require a professor to be an ac-
tive member of a Christian
faith to receive tenure.

Bo Phillips reported that Vice
President For Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan is giving serious
consideration to a change in cur-
riculum.

Phillips reported that Bevan

said several professors are not
satisfied with the present ex-
tended studies program, and
that there is continued objec- -
tion to a split winter term.

Todd Eades reported that
there was no action necessary
on the request for renewal of
the Young Republican Club
charter, since the group request-
ing the renewal did not hold a
charter at present.

Peeples reported that he and
Union President Stan Hassinger
had met with President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. on. the possibil-
ity of beer sales on campus.

“Although Spencer does not
disagree in principle, he did not
feel that this was the proper
time to push it or that it is a
major concern,” Peeples stated.
