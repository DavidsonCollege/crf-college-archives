Friday, November 1, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Richard Rusk portrays father’s humanity, optimism

By DAVID WILLIAMS

David Williams interviewed
Richard Rusk. son of former Sec-
retary of State Dean Rusk °31,
while he was on campus with his
father for Fall Convocation.
Richard Rusk has been working
on a biography of his father since
July, 1984, and will submit the
final manuscript to the publisher
by June, 1986. He currently re-
sides in Athens, Georgia, with his
wife Frances and his two children
Sarah, 13, and Andy, 5.

Davidsonian: What made you
want to write a biography of your
father?

Rusk: I knew in 1968 that at
the height of the Vietnam war,
with my father as an architect of
one of the most controversial
things this country has done in for-
eign affairs, that one day my
father and I would sit down and go

Because these people
are so much like the rest
of us, it means they have
the same hopes, dreams
and visions that many of
us share.

back to his beginnings and write
that story. I needed to know what
happened. So, I came back from
Alaska in July of last year to do
this book that we had decided to
do together.

Davidsonian: What was your
reaction to your father’s appoint-
ment as Secretary of State?

Rusk: We were living in
Scarsdale, New York, at the time,
and I was 14 years old. My
father’s appointment was a hell of
a shock for the whole family. I
knew something big had hap-
pened. I'll never forget my
father’s reaction. He had gone to
Palm Beach to meet with Ken-
nedy, where Kennedy named him
Secretary of State. He didn’t
know Kennedy, but my Dad had
the recommendations of Dean
Acheson and Robert Lovett and
others. Dad accepted and he
traveled back up to the East coast.
When he walked through the front
door, he was just pale as a ghost,

the color drained from his face.
He was in terrible shock. He lost
15 pounds in the first two weeks
from shock to his system.

D: What was it like to live
your teenage years in
Washington, D.C. as the son of
Dean Rust .?

R: I was impressed with two
things. First, how ordinary these
extraordinary men are. How so
much alike these men in leader-
ship positions are to us average
Americans. That is a story that is
best told by family. No one knows
Dean Rusk better than his son. We
see things others don’t see, and we
are aware of other qualities.

Secondly, because these
people are so much like the rest of
us, it means they have the same
hopes, dreams, and visions that
many of us share. If Dean Rusk is
representative of our leaders,
these people in Washington mean
well and try their hardest. And yet
because they are so ordinary, that
is a rather sobering thought, be-
cause you realize how much re-
sponsibility and pressure is thrust
upon them. Being the son of aman
like Dean Rusk was a unique per-
spective on the world and I would
not trade it for anything.

D: What were your experi-
ences and reactions to the Viet-
nam years?

R: I went into the Marine
Corps right after high school and
almost volunteered for Vietnam in
1965. But after hanging around an
Ivy League Campus [Cornell Uni-
versity] in the 1960s, it was very
difficult not to develop some real
doubts about what our country
was doing in Southeast Asia. For
me and my generation, Vietnam
became an obsession, and that
was too bad. It was a frustrating
experience for me, because here
my Dad was involved with this
terrible controversy and_ there
wasn’t a damned thing I could do
about it. That’s when I decided
that I had to realize this issue was
too big for me, and the best I could
do would be to go on with my life
and someday write a book about
my father.

D: How will history remember
your father? |

R: History will remember
Dean Rusk for the war in Viet-
nam. There’s a certain cruelty in
that. But we Rusks can live with it

all. However, it’s worth pointing
out that he was involved in so
much more. He was a public ser-
vant for thirty years and involved
in a fantastic sweep of history. He
helped to tone down the excessive
activism of the Kennedy adminis-
tration. In his eight years the
United States negotiated five arms
control agreements with the
Soviet Union, and Dean Rusk has
never been given credit for his
major influence in bringing about
these agreements. He also had
major influence in resolving the
Berlin Crisis of 1961 and the
Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The
only thing he will truly take credit
for, however, is that in conjunc-
tion with his two Presidents and
other advisors, he helped add
eight years to that period since a
nuclear weapon has been fired in
anger.

D: You have been working on
your biography for over a year
now. What have been your experi-
ences in this period of time?

R.: As I said, I left
Washington with those men of the
late ’60s, with my Dad involved in
this controversy. The whole de-
cade with Vietnam in particular
was a terrible experience for us
all. Then last year, when I came
back to Georgia, I found that my
father had genuinely become a
folk hero in his own state.

I heard that on the first day on
the Georgia campus, the leader of
the SDS (Students for a Democra-
tic Society] came up and said,
Mr. Rusk, I didn’t care for your

miration for the United

policy in Southeast Asia, but
nevertheless, welcome to Geo-
rgia,” and he shook hands with
him. It has been like that for my
dad throughout the South every-
where.

As his chaperone and seeing-
eye dog over the past year, I’ve

accompanied my Dad on speaking
trips. Everywhere he goes he gets
a standing ovation. I hear this talk
about how much Dean Rusk has
meant to the state of Georgia or to
Davidson College. What the
people don’t realize, what only
the Rusk family realizes, is how
much Georgia and Davidson Col-
lege have meant.to Dean Rusk.

D: What have Georgia and
Davidson College meant to Dean
Rusk?

R: My dad came off a dirt farm
in Cherokee County, Georgia,
and went on to do great things,
and that just didn’t happen by it-
self. There were many people
along the way who helped him.
For a nation to choose a freckle-
faced, barefoot boy from
Cherokee County as its own Sec-
retary of State is a most gratifying
experience, and it really seals his
admiration for the United States.
It means that if he can do it, that
we can do it! You can’t convince
me, having had Dean Rusk for a
father, that the individual is help-
less in this society. That has been
the most inspiring aspect of hav-
ing had a father like Dean Rusk.

D: In what other ways have
you been inspired by your father?

R: The most inspiring experi-
ence for me in having a father like
Dean Rusk can best be told with a
story. In a letter he once sent me in
Alaska, when I had encountered a
setback that I thought was major,
he wrote: “Rich, get on with your
life. Don't be discouraged. Re-
member that men are not only
judged by their achievements.
They are judged as well by how
they handle their failures.”

And those remarks could be an
epitaph for Dean Rusk. Here he
had come out of a terrible experi-
ence of the 1960s, as a principle
architect of a failed policy. He
picked up the pieces of his life and
continued with his story. That to
me was the most inspirational part
of my Dad’s career. In that sense,
he’s not only a hero, but what you
might call “a man for all seasons.”
My father’s record in public life
has had its share of disappoint-
ments and setbacks as well, but he
kept trying.

D: How should Davidson Col-
lege remember your father?

R: Family members of impor-
tant national leaders are somewhat

allergic to the “great man” theory
of history. I prefer to think of my
father as a “good” man. It’s im-
portant that Davidson College re-
member that he is a human being.
That’s the most important aspect
of his story.

D: What is your father at-
tempting to accomplish in his
post-Washington years?

R: Everywhere Dad goes, he
seems to talk most about the threat
of nuclear war. I remember fol-
lowing him to Cedar Shoals High
School last spring where he gave a
graduation speech to

thousand people in the tootball
bleachers on a very hot day under
impossible conditions with an in-
adequate P.A. system. He chose
to talk to those students about the
threat of nuclear war.

He spoke that same message
of hope that you heard here at
Davidson, and he had that crowd
mesmerized. My Dad’s a kind of
hero to me. He straps on the nit-
roglycerine packages, goes to the
field, sits through a long gradua-
tion program, and gives a speech
as if he were addressing the Gen-
eral Assembly of the United Na-
tions. He gave that speech every-
thing he had.

That’s the way he is living his
life. He is an optimistic man, but
if he worries at all, he is concerned
that we may lose hope. That’s one
reason he travels all over the
South and talks to any group that
asks him, because he thinks it fun-
damental that we not lose hope
He says hope is an operational
necessity in a nuclear age.

He really believes that if we
try, that we will make it. That's
important considering where he’s
been. He is convinced that the
human race will not destroy itself.
We need to hear a message like
that.

Students should exercise more caution at night

By RAY THROWER

Since school began, several
concemed citizens have come to
me to express their concerns about
students jogging early in the
morning and late at night. Some
said they had almost hit a jogger
while driving on Concord Road
and North Main Street because
they did not see the jogger until
they were right up on them.

In cities, two out of five
people killed in motor vehicle ac-
cidents are pedestrians. In rural
areas, the statistics are about one
out of ten. We are all pedestrians

at some time.

As pedestrians we must follow
the rules of the road.

When you are jogging or
walking at night or early in the
morning, remember that it is hard
for drivers to see you. As a pedest-
rian, you should walk or carry
something white or reflective. You
should do everything possible to
make yourself visible and be alert
for drivers who may not see you.

Also females walking or jog-
ging at night alone should take
extra precautions. Here are some
suggestions:

1. Do not walk or jog by your-
self late at night. Plan with friends
who could walk or jog with you at
night.

2. At night, try to stay on well-
lighted streets and walkways;
avoid doorways, shrubbery, dark
shadows near buildings, and other
potential hiding places.

3. Avoid shortcuts through
woods, parks and other deserted
places.

4. Don’t daydream. Always
be aware of what’s going on
around you. You must be alert to
potential dangers so that you may

react quickly if it becomes neces-
sary to defend yourself.

5. Keep your hands free. Do
not be overloaded with books,
packages, or groceries.

6. Carry a whistle with you at
night. It should be in your hand
while walking.

7. Be suspicious of men who
offer to protect you from other
men; attackers sometimes work in
pairs.

8. If you are followed, cross
the street and stay near street
lights.

9. If you must run, also yell.

Attract as much attention as possi-
ble.

10. If you are standing still
(€.g., waiting for a bus), be ba-
lanced, alert and ready.

11. If you are being followed
or harassed by the occupants of a
car, tum around and walk in the
other direction. The driver will
have to turn around to follow you.
If you are being followed, go to
the nearest business or residence
for help. Always feel free to call
the Davidson College Police Dis-
patch at 892-5131 for escorts. We
will be happy to escort you
