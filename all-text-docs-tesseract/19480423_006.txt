WHY... I smoke Chesterfield

(FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENTS BY PROMINENT TOBACCO FARMERS )

“Chesterfield is my brand. I’ve been smoking them for
about 16 years. I like them because they’re mild and
really satisfy. I know the kind of tobacco that’s in
them... it’s the best.

“‘Chesterfield buys the best grades of tobacco. It’s
mild, light, ripe, stueet-smoking tobacco. They pay the
highest prices for their tobacco. It’s top quality leaf.’’
