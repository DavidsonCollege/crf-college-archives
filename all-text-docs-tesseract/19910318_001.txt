NUMBER 20

_ By Sean Lind
On Wednesday, March 13,

Davidson hosted a Bone. Marrow.

Drive. The Drive, organized
through the Service Coordinator’s
Office by the Bone Marrow Drive
Committee, obtained 472 samples
of blood to be typed for leukemia
patients.

The purpose of the Drive was
not only to obtain possible donors

for patients, but also to educate ©

students and make them want to
help those in need of bone marrow
transplants. “Students are a great
resource,” said David Lindsay, a
member of the Committee and
himself the recipient of a bone
marrow transplant.

Cross’ National Marrow Donor
Program, one of 56 programs in
the.country serving 36-transplant
centers. The NMDP provides the
donors for patients in need of bone
marrow transplants. Bone marrow
transplants are currently being used
to treat people with leukemia, bone
cancer, genetic diseases, sickle-cell
anemia, and even breast cancer.
Kay Piercy, the coordinator for
the National Marrow Donor Pro-
gram, described the donor proc-
ess: First, potential donors give
two tubes of blood. This blood is
examined not for blood type, But
for genetic factors. Organ donors
are then matched to organ recipi-
ents by their genetic, or HLA
(Human Leukocyte Antigen),

tissue type.

Typing is very expensive. The
tests to establish a donor-patient
match can cost the patient several
thousand dollars.

Piercy emphasized that this
was only a beginning. Everyone
who was typed last Wednesday
will be entered into the National
Registry and this list of possible
donors will be made available to
those in need of marrow trans-
plants.

There are close to 10,000
donors in the Carolinas Marrow
Donor program. Nationally, there
are close to 280,000 donors.

Political Science Department
Hires Two New Professors

By Tom Koonce

The Davidson Political Science

department has hired two new
teachers for the 1991-92 school
year. Instructors Minxin Pei and
Ken Menkhaus will teach courses
that have never. before been of-
fered at Davidson.

Minxin Pei is anative of China.
He received his Bachelor’s degree
at Shanghai University. Peimoved
to the U.S. over seven years ago
and earned his masters degree in
Fine Artsat the University of Pitts-
burgh. He is currently finishing
his dissertation at Harvard. —

Pei has a special interest to.

teach a course in developing de-
mocracies. ;

_ Ken Menkhaus will take over
the courses that retiring Professor
J. Harris Proctor has taught. He
will also teach courses on African
and Middle Eastern politics.

The courses on the Middle
East should be of special interest to
students, considering recent devel- ,
opments in that part of the world. '
Menkhaus will also offer, courses
in political development..

Chair of the Political Science
department, Professor Thomas
Kazee, said that he is “really ex-

~ cited about what these new teach-

ers will bring to the department

next year.”
Kazee also commented on the

value of the personal experiences

of each of these men in the courses
that they will be teaching.

Kazee believes that the Politi-
cal Science department has identi-
fied two good teachers and schol-
ars.

Pei is coming to fill a tempo-
rary two-year position, but there is
apossibility that he will stay longer
than that. ;

Menkhaus has been hired on a
regular tenure track. Both teachers
will begin in the fall.

The English department has
also hired a new professor in order
to replace a retiring faculty mem-
ber. A full report on this change in
the department will be included in
the next Davidsonian.

Residence Life To
Expand Martin Court

By David Thompson

On Tuesday, March 12, the
Residence Life Office decided to
build two new apartment build-
ings in the Martin Court complex.
This decision will have a profound
impact upon the availability of
housing forall students whochoose
to live on campus for the 1991-92

school year.

The structure, known at pres-
ent as the “E Building” should be
completed, along with the “D
Building,” before students return
to Davidson in late August.-When
both of these buildings are fin-
ished, the Martin Court complex
will house a total of 248 students in
62 apartment suites. Director of
Residence Life Richard Terry
commented Wednesday that not
even 62 groups of four students
applied for residence in the apart-
ments during last year’s lottery
process.

The buildings will greatly re-
semble the structures Currently
housing seniors on Martin Court,
but the “D” building will be
equipped with washing machines
and dryers, and will have aconfer-
ence room in the basement. The
“E” building will have elevators
for use by handicapped students.
Terry noted that the layout of the
apartments will remain the same,
as the design has proved to be more
than satisfactory.

Although there is no absolute
guarantee that the buildings will
be ready in August, the bidding
process has been extraordinarily
competitive between companies
with “great track records for get-
ting their work done ontime,” Terry
said. Another encouraging sign is
that both structures will be built by
the same contracting firm, so that
if there are delays, the entire work
crew can concentrate their efforts
towards the completion of at least
one building.

Thecontractor will have to face
penalties for each day beyond the
deadline that the buildings are still
unfinished. Under a “liquidated

damages” agreement with the col-
lege, the contractor will have to
reimburse the college for any ex-
penses incurred by delays in the
completion of the buildings.

The new construction will not
just affect the rising senior class,
however. Due to the increased
number of beds in the apartments,
juniors with very low lottery
numbers might have a chance to
live in Martin Court. While sen-
iors would have the first crack at
obtaining residency in these build-
ings, space might very well be left
over for some juniors.

Terry also noted that the availa-
bility of housing for rising sopho-
mores will also increase. Sopho-
mores should not simply assume
that their only chance of living up
the hill rests upon signing up fora
triple occupancy room. If the
number of people who decide to
live off campus remains approxi-
mately the same as usual, then the
Residence Life Office should be
able to house everyone who de-
sires on-campus housing next year.

Also significant to the upcom-
ing lottery process is the fact that
Basement Belk will no longer be
available to upperclassmen, but
will be used instead as a freshman
hall.

Smith House mightalso not be
available for student residency.
“The structure,” said Terry, “can
no longer handle 14 students.”
Although no definite decisions
have beeen made, the building will
likely be renovated and converted
to office space for the Institutional
Advancement division of the
Development Office.

The PAX structure will con-
tinue to house students next year,
but is not a permanent solution to
the housing problem. The house
will eventually function as a head-
quarters for a social institution
again. Terry also hopes to re-
convert the triple occupancy rooms
in Belk into lounges again in the
coming years.
