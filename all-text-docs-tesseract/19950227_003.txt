Seniors searching
for class gift ideas

By BETH LINDSEY

Staff writer

The Senior Class Gift Com-
mittee has been hard at work trying
to decide on the perfect senior class
gift for the class of 1995 — a gift
that shows the gratitude as a class
for the collective Davidson experi-
ence.

The committee, advised by
Ryan Harper and co-chaired by
Chris Holder and Mary Beth
Crawford, faces the difficult task
of finding something the whole
class agrees will demonstrate the
personality of this particular class
as well as one that would improve
Davidson College.

Gifts for the past five years
have served a variety of needs here
on campus.

The class of 1990 established
a fund allocating money for the
replacement of trees on campus
after the destruction of Hurricane
Hugo. The following year a fund
was established to aid the Love of
Learning Program.

The class of 1992 created a
student emergency loan fund, pro-
viding interest-free loans for emer-
gency situations in which students
may need cash quickly.

The class of 1993 funded the
search for an artist who will create
a work of public sculpture for the
campus. Finally, the class of 1994

created a scholarship of $2500 per .

year for a member of the class of
1998.

The opportunities for the class
of 1995 are endless. Says
Crawford, “Scholarships have been
a popular item recently.

“In my class alone, 33% of the
class has need-based scholarships,
and 60% are recipients of some

form of scholarship, whether it is
need-based, merit, athletic, or
something else.” The class of 1998
has 37% of its members receiving
need-based scholarships.

Suggestions thus far have
mainly included tangible items on
campus. Anewentrance sign, new
carpet in the library, and benches”
around campus are some sugges-
tions.

Says Crawford, however,
“The Physical Plant can fund this.
type of project, allowing us to cre-
ate funding for something else.”

Another suggestion is the es-
tablishment of a recycling pro-
gram. Funding from this graduat-
ing class would support it only for
a few years, at which time it risks
falling into oblivion.

Another idea is to create a
fund for purchasing books for the
library or one that would support
some particular aspect of the new
Union in the name of the class of
1995. :

The committee hopes to nar-
row down the list of options and
reach a decision before spring
break.

“Our goal is to get 100% par-
ticipation on the funding of this
gift. The fund-raising plan itself
runs two years with individual gifts
being pledged this spring and again
next year.”

After spring break, members
of the committee will choose four
class agents who will each be re-
sponsible for approaching four or
five people in the class about giv-
ing a donation to the class gift.

Currently, the committee re-
quests that seniors leave any other
suggestions in the box located in
the Union Pit or inform someone
on the committee.

SGA Committee reaches out

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Staff writer

The SGA has established an
Ad Hoc Communications Com-
mittee in order to improve com-
munication between the SGA and
the Davidson College community.

The Ad Hoc Communications
Committee, composed of SGA
members, is essentially a response
to the current Public Relations
Committee. The Public Relations
Committee informs students about.
happenings in the SGA.

The new committee will take

a more active role in informing the
school about the SGA. SGA Vice
President Warren Buford insists
that many students still have mis-
conceptions about what the SGA
does or what it has the potential to
accomplish. He believes that an
increased understanding of the
SGA will arouse student interest in
the SGA. Hestates, “We will work
as hard as we can, but in order to
reach our full potential, we need
student support.”

Buford has many personal

committee. 2
He plans to propose that SGA
meetings be taped and broadcast
on DCTV. Buford also wants to
establish a flow chart so that stu-
dents will know exactly where to
direct theirconcerns,. Also, he will
suggest sending an outline of SGA
informtion periodically through
campus e-mail.

Suggestions on how to im-

prove communication between the
SGA and the Davidson College
community will be presented for
the first time at this Wednesday’s
SGA meeting, and will continue
for several weeks. One meeting’
may be open for students to intro-
duce suggestions to the new Ad
Hoc Committee: Anyone is also
welcome to leave suggestions for
the SGA in their new e-mail sug-
gestion box (address: @sga).

Budget

from page 1

increase will be about 3.5% for
next year, the non-salary operating
expenses will remain frozen for
the fifth year in a row.

If the non-salary operating
funds were not stagnant, some fu-
ture cuts would not need to be
made. Williams says, “The acd-
demic budget’s share of the whole
budget needs to be increased.”

Vice President for Business
and Finance Bob Sutton says that
the faculty is not the only group not
to see an increase in its non-salary
budget. “All non-salary expenses
have been more or less frozen. It’s
not just faculty; it’s everybody,”

he says.

When asked if the athletics
department’s 9.2% of the budget
was too great, as Williams had
suggested, Sutton said it was the
“trustees” policy ... but as we enter
a new era of coping with slowly
increasing revenue, everything is
on the table, and it should be.”

Williams says that with in-
creased funding to non-salary ar-
eas Davidson could improve some
areas that need attention. Such
areas are buying books for the li-
brary and CD-ROM technology
which Williams calls “absolutely
essential.” He says, “Davidson is
behind the times in terms of the
campus network.” The campus
network refers to hardwiring all
the buildings and dormitories on
campus to connect to the Internet.

According to Williams, the
faculty has responded well to the
memo and reconciled itself to
tighten their belts. “It’s not a sur-
prise to them, and the faculty is
very understanding of the need to
be frugal.” He says some profes-
sors drive to Charlotte to buy sup-
plies rather than spend more at the
campus bookstore.

' Williams says that the entire
campus — students, faculty, and
staff — must become budget-con-
scious. He says a main priority
should be energy conservation,
such as reducing the $1 million
campus electric bill.

Williams is confident that
these cuts will not become too se-
vere. “By managing the budget
carefully every year, we can avoid
a big disaster,” he says.
