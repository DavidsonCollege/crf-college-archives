THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, JANUARY 15, 1960

(All Unsigned Editorials oy the Editor)

Our Policy 1959 - I960:
Toward A Better Davidson

It is the policy of the DAVID-
SONIAN to present- a summary of
editorial policy at the end of each
editorship. This usually occurs in the
spring after the annual elections, but
this year, due to the early graduation
of the editor, we will set down here
the things that the DAVIDSONIAN
has proposed and opposed since last
April.

Our policy has not been directed
toward the end of gaining overwhelm-
ing majority favor by telling the
administration, faculty, or student
body the things they necessarily
wanted to hear.

We have certainly not followed

a policy of fence straddling; our
position is. and has been, definite.

Our main end has been that of mak-
ing Davidson a better college. We
have offered both immediate propo-
sals and suggestions of what seems
to be long-range importance.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

In the realm of student government
we have supported the Student Coun-
cil and Honor Court as _ separate
bodies. While it was our wish that the
Court would not have to meet, we
suggested that the Student Council
initiate action to alleviate basic, on-
the-surface problems. It was our
opinion that well-publicized meetings
should be held in the Union Ballroom
to foster student discussion.

Last spring the gymnasium
facilities were made available to stu-
dents on Sunday afternoon due to the
efforts of the DAVIDSONIAN in an
area that needed action. We sup-
ported and publicized what we hoped
would bé the biggest and best Home-
coming ever in 1959. The newly
organized Book-of-the-Semester pro-
gram was another object of both news
and editorial attention during the
past semester. It was hailed as a real
opportunity to learn.

In our Inauguration Special we
gave a vote of student confidence to
President Martin and hailed the
trustees’ choice. We later echoed the
hopes of Dr. Howard Lowry that
Davidson would be content to be
“some things to some men”, that we
would realize and fulfill our obliga-
tion as a small liberal arts college
and leave enrollment at the present
maximum set by the trustees.

It was our proposal that there be
a reconsideration, and in turn a revi-
sion, of the resoluteness of the
penalties for Honor offenses. We
think that a possible reinstatement
after two years’ suspension would be
entirely in keeping with the Christian
role of the College. This proposal is
now in faculty and may be realized in
the near future.

The after-dance party pledge was
opposed as doing more harm than
good. We urged the acceptance of the
pledge offered to the faculty by
President Green on behalf of the
fraternity committee and the IFC.
Also we expressed a desire that Sen-
ator Sam Ervin’s visit to Patterson
Fraternity Court could serve as a
precedent for other future guests,
possibly as a supplement to the Great

A Word Of Thanks

Too many people are responsible
for the DAVIDSONIAN’s weekly ap-
pearance in your room to name them
and thank each of them in these
columns; however, their services are
too valuable to go without some
recognition, even if it is as a group.
In fact, it seems entirely appropriate
to thank them that way—as a group
—for that is the way they have
worked.

No matter how much for granted

ADMISSIONS AND CUT POLICY

Our most concrete proposals

have come in the field of admissions

policy and class cuts, the former be-

ing of more importance to the school,

the latter holding greater student

interest.

To silence many of the critics of
our admissions program we made
four definite proposals: (1) Presiden-
tial appointment of the Admissions
Committee, (2) Personal interviews,
(3) Early decisions on outstanding
students, (4) Higher evaluation of past
ties with the College. We feel that
these four proposals could help alle-
viate a situation which has given rise
to too many criticisms.

The liberalized cut policy we
have proposed is a moderate one, but
one in the right direction—toward
greater student maturity. The policy
we advocate will allocate cuts on the
basis of a student’s past academic

performance: freshmen and _ sopho-
mores with a 2.00 average for the

previous semester, juniors and
seniors with a .1.00 average for the
previous semester be given the
privilege and responsibility of option-
al class attendance. Students cutting
the last day before or the first day
after a holiday would lose cut
privileges for thirty days, unless ex-
cused by the Dean’s office to work.

_We proposed no changes in ROTC,

physical education. Vespers; chapel,
laboratories, seminars and discussion
groups. We gained the approval of
the Dean of Faculty in our crusade
for a more mature cut system; unfor-
tunately, we have not, as yet, gained
any favorable action from the faculty.
POLITICS

Because we believe that it
vital for college students to be well
informed on political affairs we have
not limited our comments to the
campus.

We have been much concerned
with the imbalance of labor-manage-
ment relations. We have opposed the

is

‘inflation brought about by feather-

bedding, and the Michigan stereotype
“welfare state”. Corrupt: labor lead-
ers, such as Jimmy Hoffa and Boyd
Payton, have been the objects of our
pleas, that the barrel of organized
labor be purged of the rotten apples
that threaten to spoil the whole move-
ment.

We have agreed with two pres-
idents and the past five successive
Houses of Congress in opposing the
admittance of Red China to the Unit-
ed Nations.

We have favored loyalty oaths

increasing menace of Communism
without placing what we considered
to be. undue strain on personal free-
dom.

The editorial policy we consider
most vital to the future of Davidson
College takes precedence over al! of
those enumerated in this column.
If it is violated Davidson will lose far
more than she will gain. We oppose
the admission of Negroes to Davidson
—now or ever.

the DAVIDSONIAN is taken by the
students, we are always deluged with
complaints if we publish late, and this
makes the staff rather proud—it’s to
us a form of praise.

The DAVIDSONIAN has a tra-
dition that dictates a good product.
No praise in this column could make
those who work on it try any harder
to do a good job. This is just a bit of
personal thanks from the editor to all
those who deserve it so much.

LETTERS TO THE

EDITOR:

Tom Mainor, Tim Ray Attack “Editorial Voice”

Tim Ray

Dear Editor:

Believe it or not. I am not
trying to attract attention by
writing so many letters, but I
think that a couple of points
need discussing.

The first one is this race
business. Okay, so this is not
South Africa, but the race
question may be partially e
matter of éthics and/or reli-
gion here. Trevor Huddleston
and Dr. Polley believe that it
is to a considerable degree a
matter of ethics and religion
in South Africa, rather than
being just a question of who
has the right to break the
law.

You say the vocal majority
of Davidson students are not
the true majority, that the true
majority are so content with
the present system that they
keep quiet, and that some of
the vocal majority are just out
for personal recognition.

Why don’t you go ahead and
conduct this opinion poll you
mentioned in order to substan-
tiate your opinion? Then, if you
are right, tell us what it proves,
if anything. .

And if we, who are suppos-
.edly in the minority are seek-
ing ‘recognition, from whom
do we seek it, sesing that we
are in the minority. Why
don’t the modest and conser- ,
vative standbyers speak up
vocally and defend their
“majority” opinion?

You seem to be really alarm-
ed about the race issue; why
don’t you and your followers
put forward some concrete ar-
guments.in favor of (if I may
borrow Robinson’s image) this
“tin god” that you “hold sac-
red.” We are aware of your
sentiments.

Finally, yes, preaching has
changed since -1838, thank
God, and let’s hope that pro-
gressive thinking fike Dr.
Hall’s. continues among cler-
gymen.

The second point that needs
discussing is this business of
academic freedom.

Why is it that education
should receive a pointing fin-
ger and a charge of Red while
the farmers, railroad personnel,
welfare check receivers, and so
forth are trusted? Could this
indicate perhaps a fear of in-
tellectualism?

Maybe godd old solid just

plein folks are tired of having
their prejudices and icons
kicked over by those always
precious few who have been
honest or unafraid in their
search for truth.

Okay, so you don’t like com-
munism. Good, neither do I.
But one of the main aims of
education should be to examine
one’s own ideas, to see if they
are really substantial. In short,
aren't you. very presumptuous
to do away with,a philosophical
system, a type of government,
and a way of life without meet-
“ing them head-on?

Who knows, you might,

somewhere slong the way, In
your aversion for ideas, turn
away 8 Socrates.

You say truth is the end for
which academic freedom should

Northward Bound ....... by Redding

be the means, but how do you
propose to find truth if you de-
stroy the academic freedom?
Granted academic freedom is
dangerous. But so is thinking
at all, and so is living a full
life.

In fact, I know of nothing
more dangerous and foreign to
the indications of common
sense than to be a truly dedi-
cated Christian or to love one’s
enemies. One of your objections
to communism, you say, is your
belief in God. Is this the God
of the Judeo-Christian tradi-
tion?

if you say yes, you’re in-
volving yourself in something
pretty dangerous right there.

If you are following the ex-

ample of Jesus, he didn’t, you
remember, try #o arouse pub-

lic opinion to outlaw the
Pharisees and the money-
changers—he met them face-
to-face.

My main point in this sort of
disconnected letter is that you
are taking for granted that
you've got the truth as to what
is a “healthy academic free-
dom” already, but that this
truth is something regular un-
healthy academic freedom is
necessarily the means to.

It is fairly obvious that you
don’t favor an academic free-
dom whose end is truth, be-
cause you're too confident
that you've already got afl
the truth that’s necessary.

Finally, I offer my congratu-
lations to the American Associ-
ation of University Professors
and the several other national

Tom Mainor

Dear Editor:

I have serious doubts that
the “News and Editorial Voice
of Davidson College” is actually
what it claims to be. The Edi-
torial Policy which you so vig-
orously espouse, to me, does
not seem to reflect the spirit
of an educational institution of
the quality of Davidson.

Nor, indeed, does it ap
pear to be the actual “voice”
of the students or the facul-
ty here. Uniless, of course,
you do not print the tetters
agreeing with your policy.
Any constructive criticism of
the Editorial Policy seems to be
met with a rather defensive
and an unwarrantedly biting
cynicism and sarcasm. In the

case of your reply to the Rev-,

erend B. Frank Hall, Dr. Max
Polley and others, your answer
to them, in each case, seemed
to be oblivious to the spirit of
the letters. This does not re-
flect one who is sure of the
ground on which he takes his
stand...

Your editorial, “Changing
Times And Preaching,” prov-
ed exemplery of the normal
defense of your most obvious
stand, rather cutdated,  es-
pecially when tied in with
the reply to Dr. Hall's letter.
This is then not the free
press, which you imply marks
the DAVIDSONIAN, but one
of stagnation!

The ‘Old South’ had many

desirable aspects to commend .-

it, but race hatred and subse-

quent results do not appear to.

be one of these desirable as-
pects.

We are all interested, and
behind you, in your ‘Crusades’
for liberalized cuts, understand-
ing the “meatiing of ‘academic
freedom’ and other-area endea-
vor.

Present to the students and
the readers of your paper a
challenging and thought-pro-
voking editorial policy and !
feel certain the desired res-
ponse will be forthcoming.

Yours to an “Editorial Voice
of Davidson College”,

Tom Mainor.

NEARING THE HALF-WAY MARK

Ten Year Program May Bring
Distissa'shed Professors Here

By ERVIN DUGGAN
Davidsonian Manoging Editor

What: is the/Ten Year Plan?

Rapidly nearing the halfway
mzrk—1961—the program re-
mains unfamiliar to students.
Yet it is carefully explained to
the Board of Visitors, carnestly
discussed among trustees and
broached hopefully to “friends
of the College’ as the most
significant phase of the College
Development Program.

Development Director Robert
Sailstad this week answered
DAVIDSONIAN questions con-
cerning the. Plan.

“It's a systematic long-term
plan of providing facilities and
the program of education need-
ed to enable Davidson to take
advantage of her full education-
al potential,” he said. “We
describe it as a flexible pro-
gram to balance brains and
books with bricks.”

CUNNINGHAM PRESENTS

The Ten Year Plan was born
in 1956, when President John
R. Cunningham presented it to
the Board of Trustees and won
their overwhelming approval
for its provisions. A target date
of 1965 was set to fulfilling the
goals set forth in the original
plan.

Most of the goals were gen-
eral (“continued religious em-
phasis”), to allow flexibility in
planning, but some were clearly
and specifically outlined; along
with a provision for increased
faculty salaries was a clause
calling for “a program of dis-
tinguished visiting professors”
for Davidson College.

Referring to the visiting pro-
fessor phase, Sailstad said,
“That is definitely in the works
now, under the heading of
‘educational enrichment.’ It's
clearly a part of the plan and
some announcements about it
will be coming in the fairly
near future.”

NOT JUST BRICKS

Cunningham's proposal call-
ed for “at least seven new
buildings.” Listed were science
laboratory facilities, a ‘““Wood-
row Wilson Fine Arts Quad:

fangre.” and increased dormi-
tory facilities. ‘

But the Ten Year Plan has
its academig as well as its phy-
sical side. “We've gotten all the
major buildings now,” said Sail-
stad. “The emphasis from here
on will be on our = ‘human
needs’; increased endowment
for faculty salaries, a continu-
ing study of the curriculum,
Taculty quality and the scholar-
ship program.”

MORE FUNDS
A 1967 goal of ten million
dollars in endowment  fufds

was set in 1957. The increased
financial power will cover the
‘human needs’ mentioned by
Director Sailstad. In addition, a
program of “refresher courses
for businessmen. ministers ‘and
others" is planned; erection of
the Cunningham Fine Arts Cen-
ter will provide facilities for
summer conferences, sympo-
siums and the  long-planned
“alumni college.”

Two major foundation grants
have brightened the prospects
for faculty salary increases. In
1956 the Ford Foundation do-
nated a substantial amount”

earmarked for faculty salaries;
in December the Z. Sinith Rey-
nolds Foundation of Winston-
Salem. issued a_ grant of
$450,000 for the same purpose.
DANA AID WELCOME

How have the various gifts
of Charles A. Dana helped?

“I would say Mr. Dana’s help
has been the major shot in the
arm for our Ten Year Plan,”
said Sailstad. “Mr.’Dana cer-
tainly came to the right place
at a. happy time. He found a
college with many educational
needs—and with a systematic
plan for meeting them.”

The buildings made ppssible
by Mr. Dana put the plan well
ahead, and his recent scholar-
ship gifts boost the academic
hopes of the Plan.

WHAT’S UNDONE?

When asked “What's Ieft?",
those who steer the Ten Year
Plan find it hard to answer.
Everything, ‘it seems, is at least
started and well along the way;
at the half-way mark in 1961
the Plan will probably be more
than half completely fulfilled,

Remaining now are more
faculty salary increases, more
