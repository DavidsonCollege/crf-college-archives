youth to recover.
G.Y.A. ORGANIZED

The C. S. Military Government
in cooperation with the U. 8. Ar-
my worked out a program, the so
called G. Y. A., German Youth Ac-
tivities. American: soldiers founded
clubs for German boys and girls
where they had a chance to work
and play and to get in touch with
America’s ideas and thoughts.
Games and parties were arranged
by the occupation groups for the
same purpose.

However, this could not be done
itt schools. The problem of the
school system was eritirely differ.
ent. Courses, of instruction and
methods of teaching had to be
changed.

Experiments were made, but
most failed. So called orientation
and récducation group: were found-
ed, the purpose of which was to
discuss democratic ideas and
thoughts. But still the average
German boy refused to accept the
new ideas. The change from one
side to the other was too rapid.
In 1946, the state. governments
ot western Germany were consti-
tuted. These governments had, as
well as the state military govern-
ments, a branch for the develop-
ment of our cultural relations. It
was the purpose of these branches
to find wavs of rebuilding the Ger-
man school system and secure a
democratic education, In 1947, the
first social activities and student
activities were introduced in high
schools.

In 1948, we decided to work out
a special program for our school.
We planned to play somewhat like
a political party: the idea was to
put the new democratic ideas irto
practice and thus give the students
a chance torget acquainted with
them by experience.

foolishness that is thrust’ upon him,
does an admirable job making up
the beds and cleaning up the
rooms. He is rather short, and
seems to carry a basketball under
his belt, His appearance is decep-
tive though, for he has very power-
ful arms, and his hands are twice
the ‘size of an average man's. Once
I was unfortunate enough to see
him handle two football players

BELOVED SECRETARY ...

It may be said without restraint
that Miss Steele was one of the
most loyat members of the college
staff, She retained a loyalty to the
person for whom she was work-|=
ing. discretion, and an eternal fit- »
ness for being a president's secre-
tary. She had a genius for friend-
ship and a devoted spirit which
evoked the admiration of all
with whom she came in contact. In
her latter days she was weak in
physical condition; nevertheless her
spirit remained strong to the last.
She was a .charming personality
with a gracious, sincere welcome‘
to all whom she could assist; but
topping all was her Christian’ char- | ff
acter which radiated a spiritual
quality in all her relations.
