Juniors Have Chosen
Subjects for Orations

Junior Speaking Drawing Near
Rapidly.

Have your written your speech ? What
is your subject? These and similar ques-
tions are now the familar terms of greet-
ing between Juniors. With Junior
Speaking only a little more than two
weeks off and coming nearer every day
it is no wonder that all of the Juniors
are somewhat excited, for Junior Speak-
ing is one of those memorable events
which come but once in a lifetime. For
several weeks past the all-absorbing ques-
tion in the mind of every Junior has
been, “What Atm | Going to Talk
About?” But at last the question has
been settled. Some have decided to speak
on the war in some of its interesting and
varied aspects. Others have decided
that it was their duty to add variety to
the program, and they have decided ad
mirably, Literature, arts, and sciences
all come in for their share, So wide is
the selection that anyone, regardless of
his particular interests, would be sure to
find something to his liking in each
section.

The following list. rich with promise
of a feast of reason, gives the results of
these late labors:

NO CLASS FOOTBALL
GAMES ‘THIS YEAR

Since the regular season for class foot-
ball was spoiled by the bad weather, it
has been definitely decided to leave out
this feature of athletics this year. “This
year the prospects seemed to be espe-
cially good, and no doubt the season
would have been very interesting had the
weather permitted. This decision was
made because it is now too late to begin
the season and finish all the games be-
fore time to begin baseball.

SOPH BANQUFT ON HILL.

At a meeting of the Soph Class Mon-
day morning it was voted to hold the

Debating Teams Were
Chosen Monday Night

Teams Chosen for La Fayette and
Roanoke Contests

Davidson's debating talent was dis-
played Monday night in a discussion
over the question, “Resalved, “Phat the
Federal Government should) permanent-
ly own and operate all interstate rail:
roads of the United States.” “Pen atn-
bitious aspirants for positions on the in
tercollegiate debating — teams threshed
the question out to a finish.

Messrs. Cousar, “Thames, J. R-
Woods, Win. Love and — Bellingrath
composed the team favoring government
ownership and operation of the rail
roads, Messrs. Potts, Cumming, Koight,
Currie and Fowle made up the opposing
side,

R. W. Cousar was the first speaker ot
the night. After introducing the sub
ject, giving the origin of the question
and tracing its history, Cousar stated
the clash ot opinion of the two teams and
drew therefrom the main issues of the
debate. He then advanced two argu-
ments for the affirmative side of the
question: First, Private ownership is es
sentially wrong in both theary and prac:
tice; second, “Government ownership and
control offers (1) unification tn oper
tion, (2) economy in management, (3)
it fair adjustment of freight rates.

A. §. Potts opened the debate for the
negative: Tis argument owas under
Kirst, Can the government
administer the railroads honestly 2? sec-
ond, Can the government: regulate the
railroads satisfactorily and adequately ?
third, Can the government operate the
railroads as efficiently as private corpo-
rations? After answering these ques
tions in the negative, Mr. Potts shawed
that government regulation will solve
the problem,

J. A. Thames then spoke on behalf of
the affirmative. He proved first. that
private ownership is inadequate, defect
ive dnd unsatisfactory to the shipper.
employees and owners, (1) financially.
(2) in rates, (3) in service, (4) in
regulation; second. Government owner
ship will correct these defects and preo-
vide a system that is (1) economically
wise, and (2) financially sound,

Continuing the argument for the
negative, W. C. Cumming asked the
question, Will the railroads under gov
ernment ownership and control pav?
After proving that this question  de-
mands a negative answer, Mr. Cumming
showed that the proposed plan of the
affirmative is (1) unwise, and (2) tm-
practicable.

J. R. Woods followed with the argu-
ment that government ownership and
control is expedient: (1) Ft will re:
move the waste of competition; (2) I
will remove incentives to financial mis .
management; (3) It will prevent strikes
Government ownership is also expedien*
because it will guarantee future prosper-
itv by (1) economical service, and (2)
by enabling transportation to expand
with growing industry.

The next speaker on the negative was
F. S. Knight. He sought to prove (1)
that change is unnecessary because the
railroads are efficient under private awn-

of His Work.

On last ‘Tuesday night, Rev. John
Little, of Louisville, Ky.. gave avery
interesting stereoptican lecture on “he

small building was rented for this pur-
pose, Later on enough money was raised
to erect a building. Not only were
classes held on Sundav, but also during
the week. Because of the great interest
shown, an industrial department was or-
panived. In this department the boys
are taught: carpentary and other useful
trades, while the girls are taught bas-
ketry, cooking and sewing. Mr. Little
now has two good buildings for — his
work, From Louisville the work among
the negreaes has spread thruout — the
South. People are beginning to realize
the vast importance of the negro prob-
lem. A campaign is now being made to
get all Southern college’ men to take up
a study of the negro problem, Mr. Lit-
tlhe ts making a tour of the colleges in the
South speaking ino the interest of this
campaign.

After the lecture Tuesday night a can-
vass of the student body was made and
seventy new men signed up for a study
of the negro problem. ‘Phere are twen-
tv five who have already been making a
study of this subject,
