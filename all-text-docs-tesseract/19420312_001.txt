In introducing the

pointed out the. fact that there is
in evidence an increasing interest on
the part of college the
peace, Conyers further pointed out
two facts must be kept
constantly in mind whenever people
talk about the peace:

“First; we must win the war, else
all talk the peace is, of
course, useless. Second, we can-
ngt possibly know what conditions
will be at the end of the war.”

Agree On Peace

In a meeting prior to the-broad-
Cast, the participants eater agree-
ment on one issue which they spoke
of as being of the utmost impor-
tance. They agreed “that the win-
ning of this war is not an end in
itself; that the winning of the war
must be regarded as a means to an
end, that end being the establish-
ment of a more ‘just and durable
world order.”
