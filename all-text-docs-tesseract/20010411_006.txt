mud (md) n. Wet, sticky, soft earth, as on
the banks of a river.

The Knobloch Campus Center is hailed by
many school leaders as one of the finest
student unions of any small college in the
nation.

But in addition to its $30 million price tag,
construction on the center is responsible for
an unwanted guest delivered free by Mother
Nature.

Mud. sy

The upheaval created by the constant move-
ment of construction vehicles and equipment
has spawned huge rivers of brown sludge —

often several inches deep—along nearby roads
and near the tennis courts.

-The problem has worsened recently be-
cause of large amounts of rainfall. According
to AccuWeather, Davidson received 5.68
inches of precipitation in March, more than
an inch above normal.

If you’re one of the many students whose
travel has been disrupted by the sticky brown
monster, take heart: Officials say the mud
will disappear as construction winds down in
coming weeks.

The union part of the center is expected to
open on May 12, while the amphitheatre will
not be completed until around October.

“When you come back in the fall, it will be
a different story,” said David Holthouser,
Director of the Physical Plant. “It will be

's for you: Construction brings unw

better landscaping-wise when we're done.
It’s kind of painful during the process.”

Sometime within the next two weeks, con-
struction equipment currently. stored behind
Duke Hall will be installed in the center,
allowing workers to move in and clean out
some of the worst trouble spots.

“As that stuff starts disappearing, we'll
clean it up,” said Holthouser.

Workers have already installed silt fences
and a sediment pond near the tennis courts to
keep silt out of pedestrian areas, he said.

In addition, a cleaning truck washes off the
streets surrounding the center twice. each
month.

“Tt’s been an effort to keep up with it and
clean up as we go,” Holthouser said.

But more than anything else, completion of

anted visitor

the center itself will provide permanent re-
lief.

Once that occurs, said Holthouser, workers
will use bulldozers to remove the thickest
areas of mud.

And most importantly, landscapers will
begin planting grass, trees and bushes, which
will do more to eliminate it than any truck or
fence.

“We definitely have some clean-up to do,”
Holthouser said.

The school also expects to finish building
the brick sidewalk that currently ends just
beyond Belk Hall during the summer. It will
provide mud-free transportation from the resi-
dence halls to the campus center.

“Tt will be a major pedestrian thorough-
fare,” said Holthouser. “We’re counting on
that to be a showplace part of the campus.”

without protest and campus safety director
Sam McKelvey has received no complaints
about the ordinance.

“T think students have looked at it and
realized that it wasn’t a prohibition on stu-
dents,” McKelvey said. “There was just a
major section of downtown that was stag-
nant. ,

“In the last few days, I’ ve noticed a marked
difference in the number of spaces avail-
able.”

Both the SGA resolution and the new town
ordinance address what some say has become
a perennial problem—the availability of stu-
dent parking. According to Epps, a survey
sent randomly to half of the student body
questioned students about campus parking

and 57 percent of the 460 respondents said
that a parking problem did exist.

Harris agreed: “I’ve received too many
emails for [the SGA] not to talk about this.
There are a lot of people on campus who see
this as a concern.”

Others assert that complaints about the
availability of parking are unfounded.

“We have more than enough parking on
campus,” President Bobby Vagt said. “There
are more than two spaces for every car eee
tered here on campus.”

According McKelvey, there are approxi-

mately 2000 parking spaces on campus and
only 750 registered student vehicles. An-
other 400 staff and faculty vehicles arrive
daily, but that still leaves more parking spaces
than necessary. Citing this abundance, the
town council moved forward and eventually
passed the Main St. restriction.

“‘We happened to know that that there was
a surplus of several hundred parking spaces
on campus,” said Brice. “And with that kind
of surplus on campus, we didn’t feel like we
could use precious spaces near downtown
merchants for car storage. So the way to
eliminate that was to not allow parking over-
night.”

Professor Dave Martin; a member of the

town council, echoed Brice’s sentiments:
Sep have the right to park [on

__ Main Street] when they have plenty of park-

ing “available to-them [in Baker].”

Baker parking lot has a capacity of almost
600 cars and, under Epps’ proposal, fresh-
man parking would take up approximately
180 spaces, or the average number of first-
year students who bring cars to campus.

In addition to the discussion of parking
regulations, a new policy is in the works.

Director of Public Safety Sam McKelvey
said Tuesday night that Davidson will begin-
ning towing the cars of students who receive
more than five violations for parking in spaces
reserved for faculty and staff.

This comes in response to students who
repeatedly park in faculty and staff spaces
and disregard warnings.

“We’ ve talked to students,” said McKelvey.
“Facutly have talked to them but in many
instances, students have just ignored them.
They’ ve just walked away.”

After a grace period of one week, the new
regulation will go into effect next Thursday.
After that, every violation for parking in
faculty and staff spaces—regardless of whether
or not the student pays the fine—will count

- toward the five-violation maximum.

“It’s with reluctance that we do this, butit’s
to address a real problem,” said McKelvey,
