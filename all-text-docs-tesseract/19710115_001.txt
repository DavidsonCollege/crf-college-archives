Frats To Be Restudied

In an unprecedented move,
the Trustee Executive Com-
mittee last night decided to
review their social guide-
lines of this fall and to tem-
porarily relieve Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. of his duties as
college president pending
the outcome of the review.

Warner L. Hall, board
chairman, apparently called
the meeting in order to con-
sider revoking the trustee's
decision of last fall concern-
ing the mew social system,
according to sources close to
the chairman.

Hall reportedly said, ‘‘The

trustees had no idea that so
many students wished fra-

pledged thirty percent, of the
fraternities, we couldrn't be-

bubblegum" but felt that he
was the type of personality
Davidson has welcomed of-
ten in the past and that he
would prove to be a real
hit himself.

Director of the Union C.
Shaw Smith said he had

seen Kim perform ‘and that °

the singer “really put on a
great show for the kids."

The performance to which ~

he was referring was in the
Charlotte Coliseum in 1966
when Kim was invited by
the Big WAYS radio station
to appear in its annua]
Christmas parade,

That was the same year
Kim first gained national]
acclaim with his hit, ‘‘Shoot-
em Up Baby."

‘As for the other changes
Shelton ‘has planned, he and
Union Board Chairman Wel-
don Schenck said they will
try to answer some of the
criticisms which have been
leveled at the Davidson so-

cial system in recent
months.
Simply,, they decided to

eliminate those events from

the schedule which were tra-
ditionally poorly attended

and concentrate the money
saved on more events of the
kind which seem to be most
popular,

Shelton said_ that the
events eliminated included
the post-concert dances in
Chambers. basement, the

mini-concerts in the Morri-

son room and the-Union Bar,
and the early breakfasts in
the cafeteria,

‘(Poor attendance and a

e

sistant gave us the impres-
sion that the students want-
ed this change. Our under-
standing was that the fra-
temity system was about to

__ collapse.

_ “We are not. firing Dr.
Spencer,"” Hall reportedly
Said, “‘We're merely bidding
him a temporary farewell.
This idea. of reviewing, a
president's tenure -is one we
picked up from some of the

-Ivy leagtle schools of whom

Davidson; is the southern

counterpart.’’

Spencer had received ad
vance notice of the special
trustee meeting the day be-
fore. He immediately re
leased ‘A statement annoync-
ing that.the college had re-
ceived a $1 million grant’ to
be used for the implementa
tion of the social system.
But this move failed to af-
fect the trustees.

Spencer was unavailable
for comment, however, the
response from other admin
istration officials was one of
shock.

‘Assistant to the President
Peter H. Hobbie said that
his imagination has been
staggered by the trustee's
decision, and then he
screamed, “I will not com-
promise on the social sy

stem. Fraternities are evil,
evil, evil. I had the power

. IT had the power to
change them but .. .”. Hob-

bie abruptly retreated to his
office for a glass of milk.

When Vice President of
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan heard of the _ plans,

lot of headaches for the svu-
cial’ staff were the hallmarks
of these events,” said

Schenck, ‘‘and we are really
glad to get them off our
backs.”

The extra money, accord-
ing to Shelton and Schenck,
will bring back three per-
formances that have been
real crowd pleasers for the
Davidson community.

comment.

Dean .of Students Witliam
Terry was’ seen praying at
his: desk while muttering,
“God forgive them for they
know not what they do."

Several members of the
faculty were furious that
they were not consulted
about Spencer's dismissal.
They petitioned Hall for .a ~
meeting, but were told that
he had just left for Africa
to advise.,the University of
Tanzania in setting up a
board of trustees. He_ will
be gone six weeks.

One faculty member con-
fided with this
moment.

“ifs funny —he-said, “While
the students used to call Dr,
Spencer Slick Samthe fa-
cully called him ‘Steamroller
Sam.’ We all hope this is
just a temporary thing
but don't quote me,"

When Lyman Parrigan
spokesman for the fraterni-
ties heard of the firing he
shouted, ‘Hurrah! As far as
I am. concerned this leaves
any DAVIDSQNTAN editorial
criticism invalid,

Paper Proofreadng Wins

"You've got to admit they
can still spell,"’ conceded a
judge for the Associated Col-
legiate Press in awarding
THE DAVIDGONTIAN a Se-
cond Class Honor Rating in
the ‘Association's {all college
newspaper competition.

The newspaper suffered
heavily at the hands of the
judges in the areas of cover-
age and content, writing and
editing, editorial leadership,
and photography.

In these fields THE DA-
VIDSONTJAN _ received only
five .per cent of the possi-
ble points. In physical ap-

pearance, » however, the
newspaper received a_ per-
fect score because of its
flawless profreading.

1019 points out of a possi-
ble 4,000,

Commenting gn the judges’
scathing report, Editor-in-
Chief Ed’ Shoaf noted, ‘You
have to be skeptical of -a-
report such as this one. Only
the. comments on our proof-

a careful analysis."

Shoaf pointed out that

actually make fewer mis-
takes than some of the real-

“As for the other areas,"
Shoaf said, ‘“I'm- really not
sure the judges had every-
thing straight. Perhaps they
confused us with another
