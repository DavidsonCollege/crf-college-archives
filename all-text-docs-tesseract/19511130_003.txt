If you weren't in
Atlanta last weekend,
you probably reached
for the Sunday paper
with the. thought—
“Wonder how the
‘Plucky Cats’ came out
against Tech.” After| THE DAVIDSONIAN
you read the 34-7
score, you probably
thought that it wasn’t
too bad at that. Burt if
you read the way the
Georgia papers wrote it
up, you might think
that it was another
State game or several of
the others. ‘‘Georgia
Tech Cakewalks by Davidson” or ‘‘Coach Bobby Dodd an-
nounced over the loudspeakers during halftime for a B-team
quarterback to report to the dressing room and dress out for the
remainder of the game, bringing the total number of quarterbacks
to five.”’

NOT EXACTLY A WALTZ .

This may have been true about the quarterback and it is
teue that Dodd used a great number of reserves and failed to
play Darrell Crawford, the All-Southern and All-American can-
didate at the quarterback post for the Engineers. I don’t know
how good a coaching point it was, but it appeared rather un-
sportsmanlike when Dodd sent his first team along with Craw-
ford to the showers at the close of the third quarter.

But the fact remains that the game still wasn’t a@
runaway and that Crawford probably couldn't have
done much better than his Freshman understudy, who
completed better than half his passes and pitched about
five straight without a miscue. Also the fact looms
that Tech found it somewhat difficule to break through
the tough defensive Cat line and they made most of
their 216 yards on the ground on the three long plays,
one of which wes the 40-yard jaunt that Hardeman
took off on early in the second half.

ONE OF BEST GAMES
The Cats played one of their best games of the season
against the best team they played all year. Someone remarked
that it was the “‘smartest. darn bunch of football players’ he
had ever played against. Tech had a light, rangy bunch of boys
who really knew their business and did it. The Cats didn’t find
much trouble with the first-team defensive line in the first half
and got off to some notable gains. Henry Brown, who played a
whale-of-a-game at offense and defense, broke through for sev-
earl long gains right through the line. The passing was harder,
but Dick Kelly and Harpo Turk brought in several of Ruth's
heaves. The outstanding thing that was lacking was that old
pass defense, but their long ends could have caught passes in any
pass defense.
Well. another football season is down the track and better
prospects of more and different sports are on the agenda. One
last look at the season and the prediction of last issue .. . it
was warm for the game!

ORCHIDS TO THE STURDY THIRTEEN

Playing their last game for the Davidson Wildcat football
team, was quite an array of guys that will be sorely missed when
next fall rolls around again. Both Co-captains Jerry Kiser and
Bull Freeman will be lacking in that defensive line which was
about the most outstanding thing about the Cats this year. Kiser
and Freeman both have been stalwarts since they firet hit the
campus and certainly in their last year.

Betas Bag Two

Selected by the votes of the fra-
ternity sports managers, this year’s
'Davidsonian All- Fraternity tag
football team is as representative
as any that has been selected in
many years. Of the seven available
positions on the top team, only
the Betas have the distinction of
claiming two of them, while the
others are divided among five dif-
ferent fraternities. This year tag
football was introduced to the in-
tramural fields for the first time
and was a great success. Below
are the top seven stars who were
chosen to represent the 1951 All-
Fraternity tag football team:

T. W. ALDRED, KA

T. W. proved to be one of the
finest running and passing backs
that the intramural fields have seen
for many season. A member of the
champion KA’s, his excellent pass-
ing and running, combined with his
versatile ability to do anything
right, earns him the honor as one
of the outstanding players of 1951.

JIMMY SLOAN, KS

*“Slimy,” as Jim is called, gains
his starting berth largely because
of his superb passing and booming
punts. A member of the runner-
up Kappa Sigs and a repeater from
last year’s All-Fraternity team,
Jimmy did most of his team’s ball
handling and was a constant threat
on every play.

TYLER BERRY, Sigma Chi

Tyler was the big threat for this
year's strong Sigma Chi team. A
good passing arm and plenty of
speed featured his reliable ball
handling and made him capable of
keeping any opponent on the alert
throughout the complete game.

Bob Turk and Dave Williams, who failed to see
the end of the season in uniform because of an injury,
will not be back at the end posts next year. Also
Walter Oakes at his defensive end position, will pass on
to graduation. Branch and McNeely also will be absent
in the middle of the line. Bill Reynolds is another of-
fensive man that will be absent when the picture is
made next year. Two men who haven't seen much
action and are leaving are Bob Gibson and Bill Purcell.

In the backfield only three men will be lost, but they are
key men and have stood out well for two years. Dave Peeler
has been outstanding all year as a defensive backer-up of the
line. He has been unsung, but nevertheless has been 2 demon
for the defensive team that has racked so many dreams of TD's.
Johnny Guiton, whose heart and fight is as big as he, will grad-
vate in the spring along with plunger Ham Wade. Ham has
been dependable and ready for three years and has come into
his own this year at the fullback post and later at halfback.

a name for himself in any athletit

circle, and he came through again
this year to lead the Betas to a
most successful scason. He is a
good runner and field general, and
not soon to be forgotten, were his
accurate passes, aimed usually at
Roy Davis.

ROY “WHIZ” DAVIS

Roy gains his starting position
on this year's team not only for
tis fine pass receiving but also for
his defensive Iime-backing work.
One of the outstanding reccivers
of the season, Roy caught an amaz-
ing percentage of Elliot’s passes
for wonderful gains and certainly
deserves his spot on the team,

WALLACE ABBOTT, PHI GAM

Wallace's’ fine passes and leader-
ship of a strong Phi Gam team
rate him among the top seven. Not
one to do a halfway job, Wallace's
passing, running, and defensive
ability was the cause of defeat for
many teams this season and the
principle reason for the successful
record of the Phi Gams

HORACE BALL, SPE
Horace was the big threat for

the SPE’s this season and the main:

reason why they finished with such
a good record. He is a cool opera-
tor, a good passer, and very capa-
ble of going the distance on every
play. Horace and Wallace Abbott
finished in a deadlock for the sixth
and seventh spots on the All-Fra-
ternity selections.

Below are the first and second
team selections with votes polled
and a list of the honorable men-
tions,

Tankmen In Early Drills

men are Co-Captain Francis Pep-
per, Paul Cole and Al Ormond;
sprinters are Captain Ken Taylor,
Aubrey Miree, Pete Hairston, Swain
Loy, Ed Stuart and Robert Mims;
back-stroke men are John Stifel,
B, Ballenger, Jim Bryan, Sam
Myrick and Stan Topple. Rounding
out the squad are Harry Apple-
white, B. Montgomery, Charles
Hull, Don Southern, Bob Beamer,
and Wallace Pate.

The prospects for the '52 swim-
ming season are good and if the
improvement of Cole, Pepper and
Ormond spreads to the rest of the
team, Davidson should be proud of
its "52 version of Dick Redding’s

The first annual intrafraternity
wrestling tournament went down to
the next to last match before the
Phi Delts were able to edge out
the Phi Gams for the championship
by a score of 35-33. It was in the
bout between Ham Wade and Bill
Bryson, when the crowd began to
realize that if Ham won the Phi
Delts would automatically slide in-
to first place and take the cham-
pionship. And that is just what
happened, for Wade edged out Bry-
son, 1-0, and thereby the Phi Delts
took first place.

Despite the fact that the Phi
Gams were beaten out for the
championship they still were
able to boast the outstanding
wrestler in the tournament,
Bobby Joe Key. Bobby Joe,
who wrestled in the 123-pound
division, was selected by vote
of the judges for this honor.
Despite the fact that he had
never wrestled before coming
to Davidson, he was able to win
each of his three matches by
pinning his opponent.

For the Phi Delts it was ob-

viously a team victory, because they
only took one first place out of
the entire nine weights. However,
their wealth of reserve strength
paid off in the end as they took two
second places and four third places.

The third place in the meet went
to the Betas, who edged out the
SAE's and Kappa Sigs by one
point, 19-18. They gained this high
position largely by virtue of their
three second place winners. For
even though the Kappa Sigs and
SAE’s each had one division cham-
pion, and the Betas had none, it was
still the strong reserve strength
that paid off.
