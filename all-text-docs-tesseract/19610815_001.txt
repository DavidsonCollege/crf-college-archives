The Chopel programs this
summer have been refreshing,
and diffcrent. During the
summer we cOn scc @ morc re-
laxcd ettitude on the part of
our spcakers and 9 more rGc-
ceptive attitude on the part
of the audicnec, ©

During the summer the
spéakers do not sccm to fccl
any obligation to fill ec whole
period whether they have that
much to say or not. Rather,
those who havo had little to
say heve soid littlc, and thosc
who have had somcthing pressing
on their minds have spoken out.

This has given © ring of
Sinccrity to thc summer progrems
thet has madc the trips to
Chambcrs worthwhile.

That this fecling is not
localized with this writcr
sccms to be borne out by the
fact thot “c have heord so
fev compléints about that old
bugaboo compulsory chapcl.
There heave, of coursc, bcen
times when chdpcl has been an
inconveniencc, but thcre have
becn fcw timcs whon onc could
say that he wos actually
bored.

A votc of thanks to thosc
who have planned the chapels
and to those who have made of
them intercsting experiences,
