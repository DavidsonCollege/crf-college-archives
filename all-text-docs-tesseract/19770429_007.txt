was. That was something of a
surprise for me, sirice it is not
something I’ve been asked in
previous job interviews. I’m
not sure of the chronology of
Jt, whether it was after ‘that he
said do you have any problems
with our orientation, or some-
thing like that. He made it
clear that it was an important
issue.”’

S: Did he specify what he
meant by problems with it?
L: “‘What he meant was,

would I feel comfortable hold- —

ing a job, and teaching in a
place that had this orienta-
tion. Could I live in a com-
munity of this sort.’’

Support procedures?

S: Did he ask you specifically
if you would support David-
son’s hiring procedures?

L: “He didn’t ask me, because
I could not have in good
conscience said yes. The ex-
change did take place in our
letters.”

S: What form did the letter
from Spencer offering you the
job take?

L: ‘‘Begins a standard way,
offered me the contract, speci-
fied the salary, it-was an offer
of a job—it specified that a
portion of my moving expen-
ses would be paid. Then it said
we expect you to engage in
other activities, advising, du-
ties to the college—that’s a
positive thing. Then it said,
we discussed at great length in
our interviews, the Christian
orientation of the school, and
the key sentence—he said in
‘his second letter— was that
you should not accept the job
unless you seek to...(direct
quote from letter): ‘Only if you
genuinely want to join such a
community and, as the By-
Laws state, care to conscien-
ciously uphold and seek to
increase the college’s effective-

ness as a church-related col-

lege’.’”’
Interpretation

S: How did you interpret that
line, and did you consult
anyone else about how it
might apply to you?

L: “‘I-did not think that. I
could not accept the job with
the conditions the By-Laws
seem to mandate, and in fact
in the past have mandated, or
produced, a discriminatory
hiring and promotion.

“In that sense, I responded
directly to the President’s
invitation about whether or
not I could support or uphold
those By-Laws. My paragraph.
was a response to that invita-
tion from the President. Let
me stop interviewing and
speak normally. It was evi-
dently clear to the President in
his letter that he sought to
clarify this issue between us. I
was glad he did, because. felt
it was necessary on my. part to
clarify how: I felt. That to. be
hired by a school did not mean
I relinquished my freedom to
oppose-such policies>which “I
view as improper. Use that in

story if you wish.”
S: Did you consult anyone else

how his letter was phrased and.”
how that might affect you? __,

L: “No. ”

f
S: In your initial interview.
with Spencer, did you discuss —

tenure at all?

L: ‘‘There are really three |
processes that went on here. |
First, the recognition of what —
those policies would mean that |
began to occur in the Presi- .

dent’s office by his pressing
them home. Second, the dis-
covery afterward that there
were no Jews on the faculty, in
a faculty of 100, at a major
college, nor had there ever
been. And third, the Presi-
dent’s reiteration of this policy
in his letter; in his statement
that the Trustees take this
very seriously. All of that, I
felt obliged to indicate my
views on this matter in my
letter back to him.”

Discussion on tenure

S: Did Spencer say that it was
unlikely you would be ten-
ured?

L: ‘‘I can’t remember. I left
with the impression that that
was the case. I cannot remem-
ber whether any exact state-
ment or not occurred. The key
question is not whether I, Ron
Linden, could or could not
have gotten tenure. The key
question is what sortof cri-
teria would have been con-
sidered during my’ time there;
how would I be evaluated
during my time there, would I
be evaluated as a scholar, as a
teacher, as a person who gave
service to the college, or would
another criteria, a personal
criteria, be involved? The an-
swer is clear.”

Six-week span

S: There was a six-week span

between the job offer and your |

acceptance. Why so long?

L: “TI had to consider the offer
and consider the conditions
included in the President’s
letter.”

S: Apparently there was one
particular. paragraph in the
letter you wrote back to accept
the job offer that made Spen-
cer feel he needed to consult
with the college lawyer. Would
you read that paragraph?

L: “With respect to the college
By-Laws, which mandate-or
encourage discriminatory hir-
ing and promotion practices, I
should make clear my strong
opposition to such policies as
morally repugnant, socially
anachronistic, and scholastic-
ally unwise. During my time
at Davidson I will strongly
support any movement to
eliminate such laws and prac-
tices. I welcome this and other

responsibilities to the college

community and hope to make

a contribution towards insur-
ing the high scholastic stand-

ing of Davidson College.”

S: How long was it between

your letter of acceptance and
Spencer's withdrawal of the
offer?

L: “About two weeks.”

S: What form did that letter,
the one withdrawing the job,
take?

Acceptance disputed

L: “He said that my response
did not constitute an accept-
ance, because I failed to accept
the key condition of his offer,
being the upholding and
strengthening of the college

policies. So he said first your .

acceptance is not an accept-
ance. And second he said
‘Given all the circumstances
we are withdrawing our offer.
It_is_an-unfortunate situation
for us both’.

“I would add that I agree.”
S: Did you see it as a
non-acceptance when you
wrote your letter to him?

L: “I saw it as a qualified
acceptance.”

S: And you did not consult
legal help.

L: ‘‘No. I wanted to make
clear my opposition to college
policies, and make it clear that
I would work to change them
once I was there.”

S: Between the time you
accepted and Spencer rescin-
ded, were you consulted?

L: “No. No phone call or
letter.’’

S: You turned down some
offers in the meantime?

L: “That is not relevant.”

S: How did he. word the
withdrawal?

L: “There. were two separate
aspects to his letter. The first
was the statement that my
contract, my response, in his
view, and the legal view as
you’ve heard, did not consti-
tute, as he put it, an accept-
ance. Then, in addition he
said, in the last sentence,
Given all the circumstances,
we withdraw (not exact word-
ing).’”’

Anticipated response

S: When you write this re-

sponse, did you have even an
inkling of what kind of re-
sponse you might get?

L: “Yes, I can honestly say
that it did cross my mind, that
this might make some people

upset. It crossed my mind, ,

but not enough to make me
not do it.”
S: What was your initial
response? Have you gotten in |
contact with anyone here?

L: L: “No. ”

Discriminatory hiring
S: You were aware of this from
your first meeting with Spen-
cer?
L: “Yes, I was. Well, let me
put it this way. I was aware
that as far as the President
was concerned, that the col-
lege policies mandated this
discriminatory hiring and pro-
motional practice. And then
when I read the letter, which.
reiterated the question about
tenure, he declared that my
situation would be one in
which I would be promoted or
not promoted, considered for
tenure or not considered for
tenure, not on the basis of my
scholarly ability or academic
record, but that all those
» my
religion would prevent me
from being considered. My
religion would be the overrid-
ing concern and there was no
way ‘around it. —

“And I feel as outraged as a
black person might, as a
woman might have felt, in the
face of having a nonrelevant
criteria to judge me. I also
want to reiterate what I said
earlier that in no way was this
coming from anyone in the
department, it was not dis-
cussed, it was certainly not a
criteria. The people there
struck me as being absolutely
first-rate, otherwise I would
not have accepted the job.
They recognize it as a nonrele-
vant criteria, but obviously
there are some people who
don’t.”

Campus treatment fair

S: Were you made to feel
discriminated against while
here by anyone on campus?

L: “No, certainly not. For the
purposes of hiring and promo-
tion solely.”

S: Are you aware of the
student and faculty support
you've receivéd?

it is appropriate.”
