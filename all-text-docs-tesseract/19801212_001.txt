$85,000 athletic budget cut confusing to faculty ©

By JOHN SIMAN
News Editor

The highly touted $85,000 Athletic
budget cut, announced last spring, is
now in effect.

Just what this cut entails has con-
fused several professors, including some
on the Advisory Council on Finance,
which reviewed the budget.

Religion Professor Max Polley, who
chaired the Finance Council last spring,
said he had then been under the
impression that the current 1980-81
Athletic budget would be $85,000 less

than the 1979-80 budget. Now he thinks,

“It’s a misunderstanding.” *

The $735,142 total budgeted for
athletics for this year is almost $7,000
more than the $728,208 budgeted for
1979-80. (Budgeted figures serve as
guidelines for actual expenditures, ac-
cording to Comptroller Robert David-
son, and are generally lower than actual
expenditures.)

Actually, $85,000 was cut from this
year’s Athletic budget, but an increase
in staff compensation of about $90,000
more than offset this cut.

“Nobody ever said that $85,000 was -
cut with compensation left in,’’ College

President Samuel Spencer said. ‘‘What
they cut were items other than compen-
sation,” Davidson said.

“In all honesty, I think it might be a
misunderstanding of budgeting,’’ Polley
said.

Last spring the Finance Council in its
Recommendations to the President com-
mended Spencer for his ‘‘proposed
budget for 1980-81 which reduces the
total Athletic/Physical Education Bud-
get by $85,000.’”’ Spencer criticized this
wording as vague and emphasized that a
cut in certain expenditures does not
entail a net decrease in overall expendi-

in the same report the Finance
Council also expressed its strong sup-
port of Spencer’s recommendation of a
12.5% increase in faculty and staff com-
pensation. It was precisely this pay hike
that caused the current Athletics budget
to increase overall despite the $85,000
cut.

Polley thinks it was an oversight —
“the fault of our committee’’—that the
Finance Council did not take the pay
hike into account and anticipate the
overall budget increase. Physics Pro-

WDSR back on the air and growing

By JENNY O’BRIANT
Staff Writer
WDSR, Davidson’s student-
run radio station, will resume
broadcasting this Monday after
having stopped for Thanksgiv-
ing break.
Students can listen to WDSR
from 7 a.m. to midnight daily.
Currently, WDSR primarily

broadcasts a variety of music, -

from jazz to New Wave, as well
as _ brief campus announce-
ments.

In the future, WDSR plans to
expand its news and editorial
staffs and to air news programs
and radio shows, according to
Programming Director Will
Berson.

Once every two weeks begin-
ning December 12, WDSR will
broadcast a ‘‘Profile in Rock,”

Berson added. The first show of ©

the series will feature The Who.
WDSR is also planning to
distribute profiles of the disc
jockeys and their musical tastes
so that listeners will know what
type of programs to expect at
certain times.
- Berson explained that WDSR
‘is continually in need of albums.
Record services that provide
albums to most radio stations

do not-send records’ to carrier:

current stations ‘such as
WDSR.
The station now has a “rotat-

ing library,’’ Berson said. Each
disc jockey lends five albums
per week, with an additional
twenty albums coming from
WDAV.

There are about twenty disc
jockeys on the WDSR staff.
The station could use a few
more disc jockeys, Berson said.

Davidsonian election battle

By RICK JENKINS
Opinions Editor
For the first time in the

‘history of The Davidsonian, the

‘

candidates for election to the
editorship are running as
teams. Juniors Jean Soracco
and Bill Purcell comprise one
team; sophomore Elizabeth
Kiss and junior John Siman the
other. The editorship will be
decided this Tuesday, Decem-
ber 16, in a campus-wide elect-
ion.

The Davidsonian interviewed
all four candidates together,
and decided on a question-an-
swer format for the following

article because it presupposes

the greatest amount of objectiv-
ity.

Siman plans to participate in
Davidson’s Classics Abroad
program this spring, and Kiss
will be JYA next year; there-
fore, if elected, they would
actually. serve together for only

A major problem for the
station has been poor reception.
Since WDSR broadcasts are
carried through the dorms’ elec-
trical systems, dorms with poor
wiring, such as Watts and
one-half of Sentelle do not
receive WNSR well. |

the seven weeks that remain in
winter term orice they take
office after Christmas break.
Q. Why do you think a team of
two editors, as opposed to a
single editor, will better manage
the job? -

A.Soracco With two, you can
coordinate together. You’re
there to sort of catch each
other’s mistakes. You produce a
more unified effort I think.

Siman' I think normally a
team is not as good as one
person because The Davidson-
ian needs one: policy and a
direction that can be provided
in one person. I think Elizabeth
and I are an exception to this,
however, because we work to-
gether as well as any two people
possibly can. We more or-less

'. think as one person. It’s an
exceptional relationship; 1 think -

we'd work fine together.

Christmas Gift Fund to
support Kenyan schools

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

Third World aid—the phrase
evokes images of Red Cross
tents, mud huts, and emaciated
children. But this year’s cam-
pus Christman Gift Fund will
go to quite a different kind of
third world aid.

The $7000 drive, to be held
next Monday through Wednes-
day, will support what Exper-
iential Programs Director Ken
Wood calls “our Kenya Connec-
tion.”

Since 1974, about 25 David-
son students and alumni have
gone to Kenya to serve one or
more years as teachers and
headmasters in rural secondary
schools. Right now, Kathy An-
sheles, 80, Kathy Daum, ’79,
Mike McGrady, ’80, Andy Mil-
ler, ’80 and Ann Tutwiler, ’80,
are in Kenya.

The volunteers work through
a variety of connections—the
Quaker church, a professor at
the University of Nairobi, in-
dividual schools. They receive
wages from the school where
they teach, with pay ranging
from the state level salaries at a
government supported institu-

tion to ‘‘chickens, roots, herbs,
and cash’’ at some smaller
schools.

The students face responsibi-
lities startingly different from
their lives at Davidson. Dave

of Shikunga School from Nov-

Phonathon
successful

By ANN MITCHELL
- Staff Writer

The SGA Telephonathon,
which ends Thursday night,
had raised $36,711.60 as of
Tuesday evening.

The Telephonathon is a stu-
dent effort to contribute as
much as possible to a $100,000
challenge grant by the Charles
A. Dana Foundation to the
Living Endowment Fund. The
College must raise at least
$100,000 to receive the $100,000
grant.

The Dana Foundation will
match contributions of previous
donors one to one, and new

you believe that previous exper-
fence with The Davidsonian is a
prime necessity?

Purcell. I think it’s obvious
that both of us have limited
experience on The Davidsonian.
I was assistant photography
editor at one time. Both of us
were editors of high school
newspapers.

Soracco I’ve worked with
features since my first week on
campus; I was assistant fea-
tures editor the second half of
my freshman year and late that
spring moved into the features

editorship and continued with
that up- until last Christmas.
I’ve been doing Backpage [since
then].

Purcell We offer a special
kind of experience; we have a lot

' of Davidson experience. Both of

us have been extremely active
on ‘campus ...I think this is as
important, even more impor-

tant than actual experience with
The Davidsonian, because we
don’t want to duplicate what’s
been done in the past We want
to bring in a new paper with a
new approach to things,

Kiss I edited a magazine in
my high school, and as far as
Davidsonian experience goes, I
think I have as much as I could
possibly have at this point. I
became assistant news editor
fall term freshman year and
have been News Editor since
January. I think the news
editorship gives you a lot of the
qualifications necessary for be-
coming Editor. As News Editi -
ors, John and I have managed a
staff of twenty writers; we've
written generally one picle

of the larger, Focus, articles. I
would disagree with the’ idea
that it’s not that important to
have specific Davidsonian. ex-
