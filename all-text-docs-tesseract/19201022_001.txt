Dr. Weatherford Brings Stirring
Messages to Davidson Students

Prominent Y. M. C. A. Worker Leads in Annual Evangelistic Campaign

Dr. W. D. Weatherford, of Nashville, Tenn. opened the Y. M,C. A.
Revival, Sunday morning with an adress on “The Real Meaning of the

Christian Life.”

In a clear and concise manner the
speaker showed, first, that ours is
not a sanctimonious and long-faced
religion, but that it is a religion that
will stand by a man anywhere and
‘all the time. The inadequate forms
and theories of religion were then
taken up and their tefects showf.
The first of these is simply belief in
certain theories and creeds, which
although good enough in their place,
do not form the real backbone of our
religion. The second false theory is
the belief that Emotionalism is ab-
solutely the essential thing in the
Christian life. Emotionalism is a
result of close relationship, and is an
expression of religion, but is far
from being Christianity in itself.
Also, some think that religion con-
sists in merely lopping off bad hab-
its and taking on a few good ones.
Of course religion has a moral con-
tent, as nothing would be worthy of
the name which did not tend to clean
up a man’s life in all ways, but mere
altruism is not religion. Nor does
ritualism form the essential cog of
the works. Going to church and
prayers and reading the Bible are all
very good in themselves, but some-
thing more and deeper still is need-
ed. Then what is the true religion?
Who is the true Christian? He is
the persons who is an obedient and
loving son of God and a brotherly
friend to‘man. He is one who
through daily contact with Jesus
has come to know God as his Father
and man as his brother, and to act
accordingly.

Taking mankind as a whole there
are three divisions: (1) Those who
are the so-called outbreaking sin-
ners; who deliberately live a sinful
live; (2) Those who know and as-
sent to God’s program, but are too
indolent and careless to do any-
thing; (3) Those who know God’s

$250.00 Gathered for Democratic Cam-

The Cox-Rvosevelt Club was ¢s-
tablished among the students .two
weeks ago. Its purpose is to give
Davidson Democrats a chance to
help the old party swing the Presi-

dential election.

C. K. Brown was elected president
and has directed the raising of a
fund for aiding the Democrats finan-
cially as well as morally. Men ap-
pointed by Brown canvassed the stu-

Jof Davidson.

Looking back 20 years we find
the total enrollment for the term
1900-01 was 131. Ten years later in
the term 1910-11 the ‘enrollmemt,
totaled 342. At the present our en-
rollment is 492, but curiously

jenough, both in 1910 and1920 we
«drew men from 16 states and the

«ly, China, Japan and Persia. “Where

Captain Hammett won the toss
and chose to defend the north. goal
and receive ‘the kick-off. Wake
Forest: kicked-off to McFadden who
returned 20 yards and from that
point the march of the Presbyte-
tians was irresistible and at| many
points in the game the Baptists
were calling for water. The drive
down the field for the first touch-
down took six minutes, and during
that time Shepard, Cassell. and
Moore did some pretty broken field
ruoaning around ends and over
tackle. When the ball was within
Wake Forest’s ten vard line it was
given to Shepard who took it over
the goal line. Cassell kicked goal.
Score, Davidson, 7, W. F. O.

“During the time it took to make
that touchdown the Wildcat rooters
were calling vociferously for a
touchdown and as if in echo to the
pleading of these rooters the Queens
College girls yelled themselves
hoarse in support of the Davidson
team, Time and again when a few
yards were needed to make first
down these fair rooters shouted en-
couragement to the team which
finally triumphed.

In the second quarter the ball see-
sawed back and forth for a few
minutes and then the Davidson men
got hold of it and by forward pass-
es and end runs took the ball over.
Poe did the prettiest bit of line
bucking in the whole game at this
part. when he ran 20 yards through
the whole Wake Forest team, time
and again knocking men off who
seemed sure to stop him. Shepard
made the second touchdown by out-
running several men who tried to
stop him from going around end.
McFadden kicked goal.
