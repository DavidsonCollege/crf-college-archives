Fifteen

65 fewer freshmen self-select Court

This fall, much as the past
years during which the self-
select Patterson Court system
has been operating, freshmen
walked through the fraternities
and eating houses drinking beer
and meeting upperclassmen.

However this year was dif-
ferent in that 65 fewer men
signed up for houses, even
though this freshman class was
slightly larger than last year’s
class.

While the number of Pat-
terson Court signees decreased,
the national faternities on cam-
pus increased their pledge num-
bers in comparison with last
year.

The greatest decreases in
signees come from the local
eating clubs.

Dean of Students Will Terry
stated, ‘‘I do not think this in-
crease in number of fraternity
pledges is a trend back, to fra-
ternities. The number of fresh-
men electing fraternities is not
dramatic.”

According to Terry the drop
was caused by two main fac-
tors, first he said, “the court
needed to make a more con-
certed effort in attracting fresh-
men.”’ i

He noted that last year many
of the eating houses took large
numbers of new members and
were indifferent to the idea of a
strong rush program this year.
This indifference was tran-
smitted to the freshemen during
the orientation period and con-
sequently many freshmen were
not attracted.

He added that two eating
houses did make a concerted ef-
fort to attract freshmen and in-
creased their pledge classes
relative to last year.

“The fraternities always
make a strong effort to lure
people,” he said, “and at-
tributed the slight increase to a
good orientation program.

Terry said, ‘The drop was
caused by the overall state of
the economy. He explained that
he thought students unsure of
joining might be taking a more
cautious approach, delaying a
final decision until next year.

Charlie Robinson, President
of the Patterson Court Council

said, ‘The drop was partially¢

caused by the improved
programs of the Union.”’

He added, ‘‘Increasingly
people are finding a good sacial
life outside the court. The in-
creased numbers of girls on

campus make dating easier and
lessened the need for a social
outlet on Patterson Court.”

“I. do not think that frater-
nities are on the increase, but
that the situation will remain

Freshmen gave many
reasons as to why they had not
selected into the Patterson
Court system.

“It costs too much. Next year
I can get by a lot cheaper. The
food was not that\great either.
It’s a good place to meet people,
but if you are an aggresive per-
son or a person who likes to
meet people you can do that
anyway. I don’t feel like I have
to join for a good social life,”’
said freshman Banks Robinson.

Freshman Matthew Horne
expressed similar sentiments.
“1’m not a fraternity man, andI
did not want to spend all that
money. Slater food is not that
bad, and -you can. buy
mealtickets at deflated prices.”

He commented that he only
used the court on big weekends.

“¥ don’t feel left out. I most
definitely feel you can have an

active social life’ outside the
fraternity-system.”’

Half of the interviewed fresh-
men expressed serious reser-
vations «about their decisions
not to join: These students in-
dicated that they might still be
interested in joining a Pat-
terson Court house next year.
These students expressed
feelings of being ‘‘left out’’ in
much of the social life at David-
son.

45% of this group or a quarter
of the total sample interviewed
felt that the rush programs
were inadequate. They ex-
pressed a desire for a more
thorough: look at the various
houses and suggested a protrac;
ted rush program.

Freshman Fritz Haberyan
said, “I’d like to know a lot
more before I join. I don’t think
the rush program was set up
right. You have to make a
decision too quickly. The rush

program only allows you to look
at three fraternities.”’

Freshman Sammie Stead-
man, unsure of his decision,
said he wanted to look over the
Patterson Court houses more
thoroughly before he joined.

“Money,” he said, ‘‘was a big
factor.

“T did not know whether I’d
be wasting my money or not. If
I join, I’ll join next year after T
check it out more. The food is
better than at Slater. I think you
need the Court for a good social
life. The Union is not enough.”

He added wistfully, ‘‘Fresh-
men halls are always tight. It
does not matter this vear, but
next vear it mav.”

largely as it has in the past.’’.
“Better food this year at
Slater,”’ was the rational Union

to explain the decline. He

situation would have to be im-
proved if the court is to attract
more people.”

Wassen does not see the
Union in a competitive position
with Patterson Court but rather
that the relationship should be a
complementary one.

Hall Counselor Bill Reed at-
tributed the drop to limited
openings in some of the very
popular eating houses.

He added, “I sensed fresh-
men were more profaternity
than when I was a freshman.
Some freshmen were intent on
joining a fraternity.”

Many of the same sentiments

were echoed by Hall Counselor
Ed Willingham. ‘This: was the

year for fraternities,”’ he said.
Last year the eating houses at-
tracted larger numbers of
freshmen than the fraternities
and this year did not have as
many openings.

“Fraternities. this year
needed new members -to keep
finances within reason and
therefore make a strong effort
to attract new members. I don’t
think the slight rise in fraternity
pledges represents any
significant trend back to frater-
nities. Fraternities can only
satisfy the needs of about one
third of the men _ here,’’
Willingham said.
