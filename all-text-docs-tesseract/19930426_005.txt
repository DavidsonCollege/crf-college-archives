Beyond Disgusting ... M.A. Shirbalion & Dick Flaccidstein
Two Completely Anonymous Writers Discuss Beating It!

Yo. Davidphonian
readers ...s’up? Now, were
sure you’ re familiar with the
two pedants who normally
fill this void, but they’ve
graduated and moved on to
high-paying careers. So, in
this, the last officially unof-
ficial publication of the
1992-93 school year, we’ ve
been forced totake over. The
lazy bastardscouldn’ tbe pre-
vailed upon to write one fi-
nal column. Sheesh, whata
couple of losers (especially
that Seth guy). Notto worry,
in an historic moment of in-
tertribal good will (Jews and
Gentiles, stupid), we’ ve de-
cided its time to take a stab at
* that critical problem facing
us all: masturbation. What
did you think we were going
to Say, “Bosnia-
Hercegovinia”? Of course
not! This is the
Davidphonian, remember?
‘And what does that mean,

boysand girls? That’sright,
sexual innuendo like you
wouldn’tbelieve. Unless the
Bosnians are dry-humping
cows, we don’t want to hear
about it.

Let’s begin by examin-
ing the critical issues sur-
rounding masturbation. First
of all, is ita SIN? The short
answer: YES IT IS.
PEOPLE ARE ROASTING
IN HELL RIGHT NOW
FOR PLAYING WITH
THEMSELVES. Recall this
famous passage: “And
Moses spake unto the chil-
dren of Israel, saying to them
thusly (thus did Moses say
as he spake unto the children
of Israel): Six days shall ye
labor and on the seventh shall
ye lay around the house read-
ing the Sunday paper and
watching the Brinkley Group
(verily Sam Donaldson
sheweth himself to be a
putz); but though ye shall

find nothing for your hand
to do until seven o’clock
when Sixty Minutes
appeareth and yourecall that
thine homework surely has
hot yet been done, neither

old and strongly grounded in
good sense. In its modern
form, the warning is usually
accompanied by everyone’s
older brother’s admonition
(also scripturally based):

shall ye

“Verily, shall

draw thine
hand and
beat thy
meat, for it
is not ko-

What would the chics
do if the power went
out and the Union was af
flat out of batteries.

ye go blind
and grow hair
upon the palm
your
hand.” This,

sher.” Ina

moment of extreme theo-
logical insight, Moses codi-
fied for later generations
what may not be done, “for
verily, such is an abomina-
tion before all of Israel.”
Mind you, all the killing and
screwing and lying and
stealing (yeah, Jacob was
an honest man) is OK. Just
don’t mess around with
Mister Weeny or you'll get
it.

The injunction against
masturbation is thus both

we regret to
admit, IS ALSO. TRUE.
Remember Oedipus? They
say he put his eyes out witha
stake. Very phallic, isn’t it?
He put his own eyes out
alright, but it was chronic
masturbation and not tragic
realization that caused it.
Although, now that we think
about it, Oedipus also had
some kind of mother fetish
(“Today on Geraldo. ..”) so
maybe that wasn’t such a
good example. But its true
nonetheless, YOU CAN GO

BLIND.
Speaking of chronic
masturbation, perhaps

you’ve heard the old saw
that guys who play with
themselves more than six
times aday can’t get women,
THIS IS FALSE. WOMEN
ARE STRONGLY AT-
TRACTED TO A MAN
WHOIS COMFORTABLE
WITH HIMSELF. THEY
ALSO LIKE TO WATCH.
We know of many peopleon
campus, men and women,
who really aren’t just comb-
ing their hair while the water
runs in the bathroom.
quite common, actually.
And where would you ladies
be if the power suddenly
went out all over campus or
the Union ran out of batter-
ies? Mighty lonely, that’s
where.

So you see, there’s re-
ally nothing WRONG with
masturbation (although

It’s’

we've heard they give kids
at camp something in the
water that makes it difficult
to become interested, as it
were). Butbe warned, all ye
who enter these seductive
portals face ETERNAL
DAMNATION fortheir acts
(also. blindness and social
alienation). However, if be-
ing a sightless crispy critter
in one of the lower planes of
hell doesn’t bother you, why
then wack away. Wack a
friend; even. In these
troubled times, mutual mas-
turbation (“slow massage or
fast frottage”) is a quick way
to avoid personal intimacy
(and the germs that go with
it) while experiencing ten
seconds or so of absolute
bliss. And for the women in
our audience, straight or les-
bian, the literature tells us
that:you can have between
20 and 50 orgasms inasingle
hour! Go on, girl.

All I Really Needed to Know
I Learned as a Hall Counselor

As a hall counselor last
. year, I supplemented my
counseling activities with a
little opinions column aimed
at the freshman class to give
them a little advice here and
there about how to make it at
Davidson. Before I leave

mater, I feel compelled
to impart upon my fresh-
men from last year alittle
parting advice from an
old friend.

‘I warn you, a year of
hall counseling can hurl
aperson’s views from the
most idealistic stars and
crescents in the sky
straight into the lion’s
mouth of cynicism. You
learn things about

never know otherwise,

you who may never have
the chance to be a hall
counselor.

Perhaps my outlook has
changed a bit, or at least my
willingness to tell the truth.
You decide. Here’s the final
chapter in my Little Instruc-
tion Book of Davidson:

Ring President
Kuykendall’s doorbell and
run away * Pee in public *
Call new international stu-
dentsandharrass them * Tell
freshman girls they’ve

Just remember, when it
comes time for you to leave
Davidson, you'll really re-

Every once in a while, if you look closely enough, the Chamber Maids are laughing at you.
