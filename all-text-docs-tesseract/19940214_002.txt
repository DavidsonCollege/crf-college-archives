Faculty resists $12,000
student course book

By Christy Block

Sophomore Jamie McConnell
has decided Davidson could learn
something about the art of course
evaluations.

His inspiration is the “Har-
vard University Course Guide,”
which is published each year by
the school and distributed to every
student free of charge. Its aim is to
help students choose their classes
by providing information about
format, reading, number of tests
well as the course
ent—dquality of text, work

professor ratings.
McConnell believes so
strongly in this tool for students
that he has taken the initiative to
make it happen. Dean Williams
and the Education Policy Group
both met with McConnell and rec-
ommended he go about the project
on his own, due to faculty resis-
tance. The SGA, after hearing the
idea, granted him a charter.

McConnell's proposed book
depends on student input. Over
winter break, McConnell printed
$200 worth of revised “Course
Evaluation Forms” which he dis-
tributed to the various fraternity
houses as a first step.  Unfortu-
nately, the fraternities did not re-
spond to the forms he sent.

The Activities Tax Council

ing, referred McConnell to the

Media Board which refused to sup-
port his proposed budget of $12,000
(an estimate given by two publish-
ing companies). McConnell says
that $12,000 would be necessary
“to produce exactly what I have in
mind...the ideal, but the cost can
certainly be negotiated.”

His two great obstacles,
“money and getting people to fill
out the forms,” are what prevent
him from accepting the idea of
selling the books. “Without the
initial interest, nothing will be pub-
lished, much less bought,” reasons
McConnell.

McConnell is considering do-
ing something on a smaller scale
this year to get the project rolling.
Kurt Holmes, Assistant Director
of Residence Life, suggests that
the evaluation forms and books be
distributed by RAs. McConnell
agrees.

McConnell, along with BJ.
Rudell and a few other helping
hands, plans to publish something
by July for the incoming freshman
class and to distribute a smaller
scale version of the book to
upperclass students.

“Evaluation forms need to be
filled out before any information
can be compiled to go in the book,”
says McConnell.

“The project really lives or
dies with the siuhenia. ue

Philosopher promotes feminist practical discourse

By Court McBryde

Feminist Allison Jaggar re-
lated the importance of personal-
ized discursive practice to a crowd
of students and faculty in Phi Hall
on Wednesday, January 9.

Jaggar, a professor of Philoso-
phy and Women’s Studies at the
University of Colorado at Boul-
der, lectured on “Toward a Femi-
nist Conception of Moral Reason-
ing.”

Internationally known, Jaggar
received her honors BA in Phi-
losophy from the University of
London, her Masters from Univer-
sity of Edinborough, and her Ph.D.
from the University of Buffalo.

, She has many honors and
awards to her name including the
work, Feminists Politics and Hu-
man Nature, which Davidson
classes use as a textbook.

Jaggar is presently working
on another book entitled Feminist
Practical Dialogue: A Theory of
Moral Objectivity. The purpose of
this new book is to develop a model
of moral justification. She read
excerpts from this text and ex-
plained the theories it incorporated.

In the context of her speech,
she used a feminist anti-militarian
group as a model of moral reason-
ing and an account of consensus in
decision-making. Through this
example, Jaggar showed the im-
portance of cultivating certain
moral attitudes and how and when
these values should be adapted.

Reading from a section in her
book, Jaggar expressed the value
of hearing and seeing as entities,
Feminist Practical Discourse
(FPD), or unstructured interaction.

“(FPD) exists as a form of
moral discussion which involves
not just the right to speak, but the
responsibility to assure others good
listening and for their contribu-
tions to be heard,” Jaggar ex-
plained.

Jaggar commented that FPD
is “a doable and valuable model
through which we figure out what
we are morally forbidden to a and
what we can do.”

Theseniorseminar in pillage.
phy, which has been studying her
works, sponsored the lecture with
the help of the Medical Humani-
ties Program and the Committee
for Women’s Issues.

A tour of prospectives enjoys the weather. The 70 degree tempatures and sunny skies led
students to believe that summerwould arrive early this year. Little did they know that the
next day would bring an ice storm.

Academic

Affairs talks
aboutcalendar

By Martha Knight

Will Christmas vacation be-
gin earlier in years to come? Is
there any way to avoid the endless
wait of drop/add?

‘The Student Council on Aca-
demic Affairs: addressed ‘these
aren at its first meeting of the
semester on Tuesday, February 8.

Members discussed their con-
cers about the late date of fall
semester exams. Since the admin-
istration prepares the calendar sev-
eral years in advance, these dates
have already been determined for
the next two years. However, the
council hopes to work with the
faculty to establish some guide-
lines for future calendar planning.

The council also reviewed
standards for recognition of Cum
Laude graduates. Currently, stu-
dents are required to have a 3.5
grade point average in order to
receive this honor. After the imple-
mentation of the new grading scale
afew years ago, students now earn
fewer points for minus grades. The
council feels that slightly lowered
requirements would compensate
for these changes.

Several council members at-
tended a meeting with Registrar
Polly Griffin to discuss class regis-
tration. The lengthy process of
preparing student schedules and
long drop/add lines at the start of
each semester have prompted the
need for an updated registration
system which involves new com-
puter software. Griffin will ad-
dress the entire council at a future
meeting to share her ideas and fi-
nalize plans.

The Council on Academic
Affairs is an SGA-appointed com-
mittee which meets on Tuesday
nights at 10:00 in the Conference
Room of the Union. Chairperson
Jennifer Humphrey would like to
encourage interested students to
join them. She says that they are
“open to anyone who has a ques-
tion or concern about an academic
policy or issue.”
