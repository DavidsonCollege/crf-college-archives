Drawing, Print Showing Open:
With Something For Everyone

A REVIEW
By FRANK SOOS
Staff Writer

It’s not too late to view the
winning works from the David-
son National Print and Draw-
ing Competition. Even though
you missed the eats and art
party Sunday, the work on the
walls will stand the test of a
“Lean and hungry look.’ So
look on, the show stays up until
April 29th.

Too bad for you if you did
miss the opening. It featured
real Grimm baker, cookies and
a task force of College wives
headed by Mrs. Robert Avenger
serving them. You could have
seen Herb Jackscn light up a
victory cigar after the style of
Red Auerbauch with an air of
“TI told you so” about him. But
the show must go on.

The survivors of the two thou-
sand odd entries are, well, rep-
resentative. That is, there is
something for everybody but no

* one person is going to like every
piece in the show. The credit
for a show of this diverse na-
ture must go to Frank Getlein,
Juror.

The job of selecting a 127-
piece show from such a mas-
sive number of entries requires
not only an eye for fine tech-
nique but also an appreciation
for different styles of art. There
is bound to be something on
the wall you'll like.

Assuming that you're right
there on the edge of your seat
just waiting to rush off and
look at great art, let me clue
you in a little on the artists.
There is quite a bit of prestige
involved in making a show as
selective as the Davidson Na-
tional.

Many powerful established
artists are in the show. Among
them are Carol Summers, Rob-
ert Nelson and Gabor Peterdi.
But perhaps more important
are the number of new names
that appeared. For these art-
ists, making the show means a
chance at national prominence.
James Bruss and Joseph Hirsch,
both relatively unknown, won

two of Davidson’s Special Pur-
chase awards.

More renowned artists won
the other two special awards,
Richard Ziemann and Jack Le-
vine. Perhaps Levine mexits
special mention. He is probably
the biggie in American print
making. You might like to
think of him like you would
after getting Mickey Mantle in
your baseball cards.

His etching ‘‘Feast of Pure
Reascn” is somewhat repie-
sentative of his politically ori-
ented art. The trio pictured are
the corrupt policeman, _ politi-
cian and banker. Jack lifted his
title line from Jimmy Joyce,

see if you English majors can
find it while wading through
Ulysses.

Elsewhere, of special men-
tion: Try David Driesbach’s col-
or intaglio, “‘All Children Must
Be Accompanied by Adults.” It
features a menagerie of bizarre
characters in a multiple-plate
print.

You might join Getlein’s po-
litical guffaw when looking at
“Forward Together.”

Don't forget to look at Terry
Hirst’s ‘‘Anemone.” It’s accept-
ance launched Hirst into art
department folk history.

Eleven Students To Study
At Oxford This Summer

By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

Eleven Davidson College stu-
dents will participate in an in-
ternational studies program this
summer at St. Anne’s College,
Oxford, England.

In its second year, the pro-
gram at Oxford University is
sponsored jointly by Davidson
and Mary Baldwin College.

The program centers around
the International Graduate Sum-
mer School Lectures at Exeter
College and special tutorials set
up to expand on the lecture
topic. This year’s topic is ‘‘The
Literature, History amd Society
of Britain from 1870 to Pres:
ent.”

Members of the program are
housed in a 22-room house at
the college. Director of Over-
seas Studies Paul C. Fisher
characterized the program as
perhaps “‘‘our one truly coed
program, even with a_ coed
dorm.”

Only seven Davidson students
entered the program last year,
but this year eleven men will
take the trip. They are Thomas
Sinks, graduating senior; Alan
Baragona, Joel Bradley, Mar.
cus Brown, Richard Cooper,
Jack Fletcher and Eugene Gray

Smith, rising seniors, and Wil-
liam Allen, Frank Erwin, Jer-
ry Godbehere and Robert Nor-
man, rising juniors.

A student pursuing any ma-
jor is eligible for the program.

A resident advisor is alter-
nately provided by Davidson
and Mary Baldwin. This year's
advisor is Davidson History
Professor C. Earl Edmondson.

Cheating Prompts

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

Concern over possible cheat-
ing during self-scheduled exams
has prompted the formation of
six new administrative proced-
ures by the Faculty Executive
Committee (FEC) for assuring
that the students are made ful-
ly aware of the honor system
during the exams.

Will Terry, dean of students,
stated that ‘‘the concern is that
we educate students so that we
may avoid the inadvertent giv-
ing of information about an ex-
am from a_ student who has
taken an exam to a student who
has not had the exam.”

He went on to explain that by
“inadvertent advice” he meant
such things as ‘‘Is it easy?” and
“Do I need to study this?” An-
swers to these and_ similar
questions give an unfair advan-
tage to the questioner.

The mew procedures are meant
to stress the honor code to the
students right before an exam.
These new rules are to make
sure that the student hears the
administration’s views on cheat-
ing, he said.

Briefly, the new rules are as
follows: 1) Ten days before ex-
ams begin, the Registrar will
send a request to all faculty
members asking that they read
to their classes the regulations
governing self-scheduled exams.

2) The DAVIDSONIAN will be
requested to print a copy of the
regulations in the last issue pri-
or to any scheduled exam peri-
od.

3) The Dean of Students will
be responsible for scheduling a
presentation and discussion on
the honor system and self-sched-
uled exams during freshman
orientation.

-4) Freshman hall counselors
will arrange discussion sessions
concerning self-scheduled exams
and the honor code’s relation to
the exams immediately prior to
the exam period.

5) The Chairman of the Hear-
ing Committee will mail a let-
ter to each student in which he
will stress his expectations and
remind the students of the exam
procedure.

6) Care will be taken to make
sure that the students have no

New FEC Rules

reason to accidentally violate
the regulations and to specify
Chambers as the exam location.
Rooms other than Perkins Au-
ditorium will be used for open
book examinations.

“Our desire is for students
not to ride piggy-back upon the
examinations of other students,”
Terry said.
~ Dick Clay, Chairman of the
Hearing Committee, comment-
ing on the new _ procedures,
stated, ‘To my knowledge, sec-
tions one and two of these ' new
administration procedures have
not been met by the Registrar’s
Office and the faculty.

“Sections three through six
have been met by the Office of
the Dean of Students, myself,
and Duff Bruce, the former
Chairman of the Hearing Com-
mittee. However, the fact that
these procedures have been met
does not mean that they have
been met adequately.

“IT am pleased to see these
six edicts finally written down
on paper, although I have no
idea who wrote them or where
they came from,” Clay stated.
“The Hearing Committee has
not been consulted, which I re-
gret. This once again affirms
the ever increasing and lament-
able distance between the col-
lege administrators on the one
hand and approximately 1000
students om the other,” he said.

Ralph Peeples, Student Body
President, said that he thought
the new procedures are neces-
sary, but that these rules are
full of implications “that some-
one does not trust the students.

“T think we need to define on
paper precisely what a _ viola-
tion of the honor code is im rela-
tion to self-scheduled exams be-
cause there is confusion and ig-
norance as to what a violation
is,’ he added.

‘““T think that the problem here
is not just a student problem
and you don’t get anywhere by
Saying, categorically, that stu-
dents alone are at fault,’ Pee-

‘ples said. ‘This points to a big-

ger problem and that is that
sizable segments of the admin-
istration and faculty don’t seem
to be willing to trust the stu-
dents to uphold the honor sys-
tem.”

Room Drawing Announced

By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

The lottery for room reserva-
tions for the academic year
1972-73 will be held during the
first week of April according
to Scotty Nicholls, Director of
Student Housing.

The first step for all students
is to pay their $100 deposit
against school costs in the
comptroller’s office. The $100
deposit is required by the col-
lege.

Upperclassmen may retain
their present rooms by signing
up in the Housing Office. Fresh-
men may not retain their rooms
since the college plans to use
Sentelle, Cannon and Watts for

freshman housing again next
year.

Single rooms and three-man
suites will be assigned on April
3. Seniors will draw their num-
bers at 8:30 a.m. or 12:30 p.m.
and be given the opportunity to
choose their rooms at 1:30 p.m.
Juniors will then draw for the
remaining singles and_ suites
from 2-4 p.m. Assignment of
junior rooms will begin at 4:30
p.m.

Seniors who wish to room
with sophomores will be requir-
ed to draw in the sophomore
draw. Due to several cases of
seniors signing to room with
sophomores, and then switching
rooms so that sophomores room
together in senior housing, Mrs.

Nicholls felt that seniors truly
wishing to room with sopho-
mores would have to “‘lay their
friendship on the line.”
Seniors wishing to room with
juniors or juniors wishing to
room with sophomores, however,
will be allowed to draw with
their respective classmates.
All rooms other than retained
rooms, singles or three-man
suites will be assigned as fol-
lows: April 4, juniors draw from
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and re-
ceive room assignments at 7:30
p.m.; April 5, sophomores draw
from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and
receive assignments at 7:30
p.m.; April 6, freshmen draw
from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and
receive rooms at 7:30 p.m.
