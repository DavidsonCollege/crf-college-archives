Pledge Programs Completed
As Greek Week Approaches

By 8RUCE WEIHE
Stott Writer

Pledge pronprams of the 12
Davidson fratertittes are now
drawing te a close, 2 months
after the freshmen were engulf
ed by brotherhood.

One of the more basic trends
of the pledge programs over the
past few yeut's has been away
fram hazing. This, together with
a few service projects and dis-
cussions, has marked a rather
unexciting period of pledgeship.

SAE pledge trainer Ed Arm
Heid stated that his fraternity
fumed to “get completely awny
trom the hazing aspeet and alm
to establiah a stronger relation-
whip betwven tite brother and
pledge through other activities,”

This snme attitude was voiced
‘by Ben King of Kappa Sigma,
who said that “Intestation into
the fealernity, and a potiev defi:
mtely against aang are bring
stressed.” King nleo mentioned
that Kappa Siymn ia on proha-
tion for a hazing violation fast

Sig Ep pledges had coliccted for
the Heart Fund on Heart Sun-
day (Feb. 18) ond are planning
an warking later at the Alexan-
der Home In Charlotte. “We've
tried to stress that the frater-
nity is not only a social organi-
vation but also should have an
integral function ax an aid 10
the college and community.”

Clay Ford said that ‘the pledge
program was aimed at giving
each pledge ample opportunity
to develop in all four phases of
college life: intellectual. phys:
cal, spiritual and secil. Any
netivities the pledges porticipat-
ed in were nol things they had
to do for the sake of doing some-
thing, but were worthwhile pro-
jects."

whose pledges have visited the
children at the Gastonia Ortho.

felt that everyone. pledge and
active alike. hag bis own ides of
what the pledge program should
aceomplish and therefore saw
no general purpose. “Some tritk
it's preity worthwhile, but oth-
ers think it is moraningless.”'

Most of the ather frnternitics
limited ubeir pledge programs,
to discussions on fraternity and
campue issues. and stimulating
pledge unity and spieit. Bill Oel
rich af the Sigma Nu‘s reported
that they had held discussions
on the retntive values af the ball
system and planned one oo next
year's rush system. Gelrich said
that the pledges took an active
part in the discussion, which
serves to adapt the pledges to
the fraternity more ensily.

The Pikas and Pl Kapps also
streased constructive pledge pro-
grams. aiming to havo the
pledges better understand the
workings of the fraternity and
to know the members them-
elves, Don Carrell, Pika pledge
trainer, 3nid they had a series
of discussions taking # ‘‘critical

Stresses Need

For Alcohol Discussion

“Much will be inwn in the
next few weeks an to how we
ave going to deal with the alco-
hol problem.” said Riek Marrell,
a leader of the Preshbyterinn
Church commiltee which spon
gered the Alcohol Forum Jast
week.

Harrel) stressed a need for a
solid understanding on the part
of the students and faculty. He
sald, “The next step will be a
dceper discussion in smaller
groups. The forum has served
its purpose, Now we must be
educated more thoroughly to
the probtem.

“The purpose of the forum,”
he continued. ‘was to awake and
to educate the comrsunity to the
problem. The forum was pre:
sented a8 an honest approach
lo all aspects of the problem, I
think it did n geod job in ac.
complishing these things.”

Harrell stressed that the pur
pase of the Presbyterian Charclt
was only to awnke the communi.

it is up to the students to con-

linue: He gald that the church

“There is a -eneral dissatis-
foction with the alcohol situation

on. “Nobody would dispute that

dents is for a LUberalizing of
