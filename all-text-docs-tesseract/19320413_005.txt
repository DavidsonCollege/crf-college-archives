Fresh Tie Charlotte,
2-2,in Hurlers’ Duel

The Davidson Wildkittens played Charlotte
High to a 2-2 tie Friday afternoon at Inde-
pendence Park, The game was called at the end
of the ninth because of rain and darkness,

Bub Mulligan, of Charlotte, engaged Ashton
in a hurlers’ duel in which Mulligan got a little
the best of the argument. Ashton held his op-
ponents scoreless until the third when, with
two men out, Diehl singled to center and then
Captain Morris hit one to deep left field for a
home run and Charlotte’s only runs.

In the eighth, Bumgarner, Johnny Mackorell,
and Shrimp Morris secured singles to give the
Wildkittens their two runs.

Throughout the contest the Davidson infeld-
ers gave their pitcher all they had in way of
support.

Wildcat Golfers Suffer
Three Defeats on Trip

A battered Wildcat golf team returned from
an invasion of Georgia and South Carolina
with a lone scalp to their credit, that of Fur-
man’s Purple Hurricane, whom they defeated,
18-0. Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Emory all
administered decisive beatings to the local links-
men.

In the first match Emory jumped on_ the
Wildcats, and sent them down, 13-5. The match
was played over the course of the Druid Hills
Country Club in Atlanta. T. P. Caldwell at
No. 4 was the only winner for Davidson.

The ’Cats next encountered the Golden Tor-
nado from Georgia Tech over the sporty East
Lake Club terrain, Bobby Jones’ home course,
and came out on the short end of a 11-7 score.
The match was featured by Captain Jack Wag-
ner’s victory over Tech’s No. 1. Wagner tallied
a medal 77 to take scoring honors for the after-
noon.

In the closing matches of the trip, Davidson
showed a complete reversal of form on suc-
cessive days, being blanked by Georgia the
first day, and taking an 18-0 victory over Fur-
man the next day. Captain Wagner again had
the low medal.

Debaters Win

Riley Powell, Leland McKeithan and
George Pardington have returned from
a debating tour. While away the team
met Bucknell University and the Uni-
versity of Virginia. The subject of the
debate was Resolved: “That Congress
Should Enact Legislation Providing
Cengrplized Control of Industry.” The
debate at Bucknell took place April
7th before the Lewisburg Rotary Club
and the club voted in favor of the Da-
vidson debaters. Out of 18 debates that
Bucknell has debated this year they
have only lost two and these were won
by Davidson.

On April 4th Davidson debated the
University of Richmond and this con-
test was decided in favor of their op-
ponents. George Pardington acted as
an alternate debater.

a moment from the laboratory in the Western
Reserve Medical Building, Dr. Theodore T.
Zuch of the medical school faculty returned to
find the room in flames. He called the fire

A “brilliant flash’ which set off the fire did

vas masks fought the blaze.

Columbus, Ohio—(IP)—Six student mem-
bers of the Scarlet and Mask, Ohio State Uni-
versity musical comedy club, were suspended
last week as the result of an alleged conspir-
acy to evade the eligibility rules. Rumors were
prevalent on the campus that the club would
he forced to suspend activities for a year. Dr.
George W. Rightmire, president, would neither
confirm nor deny the rumors.

Manistique, Mich.—(1P)— When 441,000
pounds of dynamite were set off in a quarry
here, a faint record of the explosion was ob-
tained on the .seismograph at Georgetown Uni-
versity in Washington, D. C. The distance
cross country between the two points is 735
miles.

Seven miles of TNT fuse were used to set
the blast off all at once for the purpose ef aid-
ing scientists to record it.

| The real purpose, however, was to dislodge
| 1,250,000 tons of limestone, a year’s supply.

| New Haven, Conn.—(IP)—In the future
; Yale should pick its athletic coaches without
| regard to where they graduated, the Yale Daily
| News declared editorially , recently.
| “There is no reason,” the News said, ‘why
la graduate of Yale should make a better coach
than a non-graduate.”

The News criticised the university for its al-
leged attitude in thinking it could prove its

Cleveland, Ohio—(1P)—Leaving a chemical] pointing to the maintenance of its alumni-coach

policy.

“There is little or no connection between the
Alma Mater of the coach and over-emphasis,”
the News said.

As a matter of fact, the paper said, the
alumnus coach might feel he had to win his
game with Harvard at any cost.

“A good coach,” the editorial said, “is a
coach who can inspire men with ideas of good
sportsmanship and who knows that football is
not everything in the player’s life, and who de-
velops a moderately successful football team.
In other words, a good coach looks at football
in a sensible light.”

Mexico City—(IP)—When the entire stu-
dent body at the government’s Indian agricul-
tural school at Chapingo went on strike as a
protest against new methods of study, the uni-

would not return to their classes unless the
reforms were abolished.
