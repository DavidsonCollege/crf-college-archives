The men whose pictures are on this page, to gether with Pat Harnion, Camper O’Neal, Lewis McColgan, Paul Maulden,
and Dick Grey, whose picture appears on the sports page, all played their last game in a Wildcat uniform last Thursday
against Duke. As many of these were star players, they leave vacancies in the ranks that will present a real problem to

Coaches Younger and Tilson at the beginning of next season.
