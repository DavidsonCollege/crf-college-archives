CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
3) Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

“Muddy water” was all around
their feet up at Lexington Satur-
day, and if the famous song hit
by that name hadn’t been written
before, it would have had birth
then without a doubt. The min-
ute the Davidson boys reached the
field the heavens opened and the
rain came down. And of the wet-
ness and the sight of V. M. I.’s
“beef trust” coming on the field,
however, didn’t daunt the blood-
thirsty Cats, and they proceeded to
give their scrappiest exhibition of
the current season.

It looked like a Davidson team for the
first time in weeks, and the way those lit-
tle red-shirted linemen locked horns with
the best of Virginia’s soldiery was a sight
to remember for many moons. Again and
again, the Cadets cannonaded their way to
the last trench of the Wildcat stronghold,
and every time, when it seemed that noth-
ing could avert a touchdown, the thin red
line threw them back. A fumble paved
the road for the enemy's initial count,

and a 15-yard penalty placed them in line |

for the next one. ;

The ‘Cats were badly handicapped by
the wet field and ball, and never got a
sustained offensive started, but they suc-
ceeded in making every thrust by the Sol-
diers a most miserable experience.

Our cap is off to Walter Fraley
after seeing him play behind the
line in that game. The pride of
Barium Springs flashed the best
defensive game seen hereabouts in
a good while. When a runner
evaded the line, this sophomore
fullback took it upon himself to
stop the play, and he did just that
about every other play of the
game.. Coach Monk was over-
come, and greeted him with real
bona fide words of commendation
when he finally came out of the
game in the last quarter. So you
know that Fraley must have show-
ed real pigskinning.

None of the Davidson men were seen
weeping over the fact that Ab Barnes,
candidate for All-Southern Honors, was
out of the game. Barnes graced the bench
throughout the contest, having been in-

For the second straight year Virginia
Military Institute applied the whitewash
to Davidson's Wildcats. Thirteen to
nothing was the count this time, and that
was just about the difference between the
two teams last Saturday. Every step of
the way the Wildcats fought valiantly and
| doggedly, many times hurling back the
heavy Cadet eleven from the very shadow
of their goal posts. On two occasions,
aided by a fumble and a long Davidson
penalty, the pushed the oval
across the last white mark, kicked goal
once, and that was the scoring.

In the first quarter, Davidson got off to
a splendid start. Kell broke away for
pretty runs of 22 and 42 yards to keep the
Cadets on their heels, and Brock did some
nice punting to protect the Wildcats’ goal.
| Sdon, however, an adverse break in the
form of a Davidson fumble, gave V.-M. I.
| the ball and the Red and Black 16-yard
| strip. A sustained drive from this point,
| with the ’Cats fighting vigorously, netted
la touchdown, Goal failed.
| Again, in the final period, V. M. I. rush-
ied the ball through a rapidly tiring Wild-
jcat line to the 45-yard line. Here a 15-
| yard penalty on Davidson gave the Cadets
| first down on the 30-yard line. A long
| pass, Williams to Loughorn, placed the

ball on the six-yard mark, and from here
Williams ran off tackle for the score,
Scott kicked a pretty placement goal.

Davidson never threatened seriously to
| score, but many times the slashing runs
| of Kell had the Cadets on the go. The
| wet ball, for it was raining steadily most
j of the time, seemed to hinder the attack
| of Monk's men considerably. They found
lit difficult to handle the slippery oval.
| Always it was the superb. defense those
| frail ‘Cats put up that held off the plung-
| ing Cadets from additional scores. With
| little chance to win the battle, the Wild-
j cats lived up to its name as a fighting
| team in grand style, and gamely withstood
[the powerful thrusts of the heavier and
more experienced military team.

Too much praise cannot be given to

- All eyes now turn toward the
Gate City of Greensboro, where
Monk will shoot everything he’s
got to win from Gus Tebell and
his tough crew of Technicians. The
Wolfpack is threatening to walk
off with honors in the state again
this fall. From reports it seems
that Carolina was the under dog in
the scrap with Bob Warren and
company, and everybody found out
that State packed a wallop when
they held Florida to a couple of
markers. State is going to be just
as hard to lick as ever, even if Mr.
Jack McDowall has pulled stakes
over at Raleigh.

Cy. they needed so badly. Baker, David
and Goodykoontz saw very little service
at Lexington, while Sam Black, of course,
remained on the sick list. All these boys
should be rearing to get in this week, and
providing that the team fights as it did
against V. M. I., we refuse to agree with
the experts and concede State a victory.
Again the Wildcats are rated as having no
chance, and for this very reason they are
more dangerous than ever.

If Carolina should drop a few
more regulars on account of in-
juries in this week’s clash with Bill
Laval’s Gamecocks from South
Carolina, then the Wildcats would
be downright dangerous to the
Tar Heels on Homecoming Day.
Collins’ team was evidently weak-
ened by the rough treatment re-
ceived at the hands of Tech’s line-
men, and we attribute a large part
of their showing against State to
that fact. Carolina has a great
team this year—there is no getting
around that fact. Their backs
alone are enough to insure a great
eleven.
