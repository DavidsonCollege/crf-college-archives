Project To Explore
Rocky River System

By JOHN TATUM
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Center
for Honors Studies plans an in-
tensive interdisciplinary study
of the ecologically ravaged
Rocky River watershed area.

The project will include
economic and political studies
as well as scientific research on
conditions in the area.

According to Professor of
Biology David C. Grant, project
director, the project will be
carried out over a period of
three years. The first year will
consist of a pilot study to deter-
mine areas in which to con-
centrate action.

The next two years will add to
the initial biological and
chemical study with research
on the effects of economics and
politics on area conditions.

Funding for the project is ex-
pected to come from several
grant applications. If these
grants are approved, over
$100,000 will be available for use
in buying equipment, providing
summer stipends, and other
related expenses.

Speaking of the funding,
Grant stated ‘‘We’re going to do
the project. The sophistication
of it will depend on the financial
support we get.”

Grant felt that the major
problem facing the project is
changing the attitudes of the
people involved. But he said he
was “hopeful of cooperation
from all segments of the

regional community.”

However, both Grant and
Dean of the Honors Center Earl
R. MacCormac stressed that
the inquiry will not be restricted
or the information gathered
suppressed

“‘We will not be bound by the
economic and political power
blocs that control the streams,”’
said MacCormac.

The Rocky River project is an
attempt by the Honors Center to
involve its students in coor-
dinated activity with their
fellow students.

In past years there has been
criticism of the Honors
program as being “‘isolated.”’

In another response to the
isolation criticism, the Honors
Center is now holding bi-
monthly luncheons for all
Honors students.

If like many students you are
bemoaning your large phone
bill, you might take comfort in
knowing that you are not alone.

Figures recently released by
Southern Bell indicate that
Davidson students received
phone bills for the month of Sep-
tember totaling over $5400.

The average student bill was
in the neighborhood of $30, con-

average of about $9 in long

An analysis of Southern Bell’s
records indicates that most
student phone bills are com-
parable to that of the average
resident, but that the figure for
toll calls was noticably higher
in the case of students.

Jagger And Stones Hit Peak
With “Goats Head Soup” Cuts

By WILL ROBERTSON

The number of albums as
good as the Rolling Stones’
“Goats Head Soup’ can be
counted on your fingers.
Perhaps on the fingers of your
left hand. It is as good
musically as anything the band
has done, with songs ranging
from the softest to the hardest
rock.

This review will concern the
lyrics, for they are as coherent
and poetic as any since Dylan's
“John Wesley Harding.’’ Those
who only listen to the words on
“‘Angie”’ will miss a great deal.

The first song, ‘‘Dancing With
Mr. D,” is about the grim
reaper, death. In the last verse
Jagger is doing what only Jum-
pin’ Jack Flash could do, dan-
cing with ‘‘a lady in black,
wearin’ black silk gloves and a
black silk hat.”’

She is none other than
Mistress D, and every song on
the album is written about the
woman she represents.

In “100 Years Ago,” Jagger
tells of a love now lost: ‘Mary
and 1 would sit upon the gate
Just ’ at sun risin’ in the
sky What tender days, we had
no secrets hid away Well, it
seems about a hundred years
we Coming Down Again” is a
beautiful, floating song that
first mentions the conflict. Jag-
ger admits adventures with
other women, saying, “Being
hungry, it ain't no crime.” But
Mary is jealous and will fight:
“She turned green and tried to
make mecry.”

In ‘‘Heartbreaker"’ we go for-
ward in time, and Mary is now a
heroin addict: ‘Over on the

street corner Sticking needles
in her arms She died in the dirt
of Hollywood Her Mother said
she had no chance.”

‘“‘Angie’’ is a beautiful song
that cannot be ruined even by
AM radio overexposure. Here
Jagger says goodbye to a
woman that he still loves, with
no reason given.

In view of other weather.
images, the first lines, ‘“‘When
will these clouds all disappear
Where will it lead us from
here,’’ would seem to refer to
the woman's addiction. The
change of names will be
discussed later.

The next song, ‘‘Winter,”’
uses images of cold to express
dispair and hopelessness, The
girl’s death is again mentioned:
“And I wish I’d been out in
California when the lights on

‘round.”’

In ‘“‘Can You Hear the
Music,” Jagger says that he
can survive through his music:
“Sometimes yoy're feeling
you've been fi around and
your rainbow just ain't here,

even more
printable, but it is possible to
gather that Mick is
about a girl who moved to
Hollywood to make blue movies
and made it with movie stars.

I readily admit that the songs
may be independent of each
other, but the use of similar
images and references seems

to indicate a unity.

Who is the woman? She is no
real person, but someone
created from many of Jagger’s
experience fantasies.

The use of the names Mary
and Angie makes me think of
Marianne Faithfull, Mick’s
girlfriend for several years,
who fought a long battle with
heroin addiction.

Angie Bowie, who has been
seen with Jagger, may also be a
part of the picture.

Jagger has always been ab-
struse in his songs, and one may
read into them most anything.
At any rate, ‘‘Goats Head Soup”’
is a brilliant album.

phone bills there are a few ways
to cut costs and inconvenience.

One such pathway open to
students is to ask that their
phone service be suspended at
half rate over long vacations.
When service is suspended the
phone remains in the room, but
the line is disconnected at the
Southern Bell Office in Charlot-
te.

Although suspending service
is most applicable to summer
vacation since the student is
billed half rate only if the
phone is disconnected 30 days or
more, it might be feasible over
the 17 day Christmas break if
one is willing to go without
phone service for 13 days before
or after in order to make the
required 30.

Students who put their phones
on suspended service during the
last summer saved about $2, but
pointed to the convenience of
not having to wait for rein-
stallation as the chief benefit.

If a student selects a room in
the annual spring drawing
which already has a phone in-
stalled, he can arrange to have
the phone retained through the
summer on suspended service.

To take over someone else’s
phone one meerly signs what

bills.

A rather extreme possibility
is that a group of students band
together and buy a Wats Line
for their long distance calls. A
Wats Line is a direct dialing
long distance line which offers
unlimited use for a basic mon-
thly payment.

However, a line is expensive
and the legal ramifications of
students buying one are presen-
tly unclear.

There is also a_ possibility
that a centrex system may be
installed for use by the entire
college within the next few
years.

Basically, a centrex system
differs little from a _ con-
ventional system in outward ap-
pearence.

Under centrex, Southern Bell
would assess the college for the
entire system and the college
would thus become the billing
agency for toll calls and other
fees.

If the centrex system were
adopted all dorm rooms would
be provided with phones, and
their cost would be _in-
corporated into the room rent
with the possibility of some
savings to students in the long

run.

UNC in Charlotte has adopted
the centrex system and its in-
ception has reportedly met with
favorable response from
students there.
