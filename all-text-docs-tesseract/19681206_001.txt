Union Cafeteria’s °C’ Rating
Brings Continuing Inquiries

By DICK ANDERSON
Asst. Managing Editor

Although state Health De
partment inspectors removed
the Union cafeteria’s “‘C”
rating certificate Nov. 22,
inquiry into the food service
situation continued this week.

Cafeteria Manager Klaus
Kleeberg and Business Man
ager Robert A. Currie met
with the Student Life Com

mittee Tuesday to discuss
the situation.
“We discussed the cafe-

teria program and decided to
set up a student food com
mittee,"’ said senior Randy
Phillips, a student committee
member. “This committee
would meet with Mr. Klee-
berg and provide a channel
for student complaints and
suggestions.”

Currie, Kleeberg and Sam
uel F. Boyte, assistant direc-
tor of the College Union,
agreed that food prepara
tion was not at fault in the
low rating, blaming instead a
“combination of factors.”

“The inspector came in
during the  after-breakfast
cleanup when the cafeteria
shambles,” Boyte
said. He said an inspector
could either mark off for
something or order it to be
fixed without counting off

GE Bowl

By PAUL ROWLAND
Staff Writer

Davidson has officially ac
cepted an invitation to par-
ticipate in the General Elec.
tric College Bow! on April 6.

As of Tuesday 73 people
had signed the list from
which the Davidson team
will be chosen. Representa
tives will be selected by an
elimination competition to
be set up later, according to
Sam Boyte, assistant direc-
tor of the College Union.

Boyte said the Union col-
lected signatures of students
interested in participating in
the program and presented
the list to President Samuel

spection.

“The inspector came back
last Friday and said there
would be no problem with
getting an ‘A’ rating,”’ Boyte
said.

However, Sterling Aber
nethy, a member of the
Union Bodrd’s Food Service
Committee, which submitted
suggestions for improvement
in the food service earlier
this fall, said the sanitation
of the cafeteria was still bad.

“Ice is still served in garb-
age cans placed on the floor
where dirt, spilled drinks and
food and insects contaminate
it," he said.

He added that he saw
water standing on the
floors of the kitchen at night
after the “C"’ rating was
given, and mold growing on

stale desserts served after
the “‘C"’. rating.
Currie said that the Oct.

29 report of the Union Food
Service Committee was under
study by. college officials. He
and Kleeberg were to meet
yesterday to look further at
the report, which dealt with
problems such as a_ better
snack bar and catering ser
vice as well as with the cafe.
teria itself.

“However, the buck stops
here; I'm responsible for the
entire food service, area,”
Currie said.
