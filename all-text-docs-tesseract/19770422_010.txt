I may have fooled myself before,
but the criteria I use when looking at
contemporary painting is no different
from the one I adopt when I view a
Rembrandt, an ancient Polynesian
wood carving, or an Assyrian paint-
ing.

The creative process has always
been the same, and will remain so.
That is, the painter looks at nature
and consciously or subconsciously is
inspired by some aspect of it, and
paints it as he sees it. The quality of
the painting-depends on the artist. In
other words, what matters is. how
great the artist’s spirit is. Ezra Pound
has told us: ‘‘It is not so much what
an artist says, but with what degree
of intensity he says it.”

The eight studio art majors—Paula
Schmidt, Steve Kimmel, Laura Cal-
houn, Nat Harrison, Patti Smisson,

George King, Peter Green, and Steve |

Fitzgerald—are currently exhibiting
their works in the Chambers Art
Gallery and each reveal their own
stylistic innovations.
Peter Green

The one constant in Peter’s work,
as far as I could see, is a kind of
furious energy that allows him to
produce a great deal of one kind of
work and to shift rather rapidly from
one style to another. His ‘‘Untitled”
watercolor and ink is a bold story of
conflict. Indeed he is a skillful story-
teller who combines images and
paints splashes to produce elliptical
narratives that strongly limit at
repressed desires and unspeakable
perversities.

April 22, 1977

Steve presented five graphite
works, all revealing the emergence of
a mature and original style. His
“Self-portrait” has lines protruding
across the face which suggest slits of
radiant light, like those emanating
from holy figures in Sienese- painting.
His drawings deliberately create a
type of immediate experience that is
abruptly tr: erred to the memory.

STUDENT ART SHOW opened Tuesday,

Nat Harrison

Working mainly in watercolors and
acrylic, Nat has often tried a new
innovation of what he calls ‘‘a person-
able approach on color: That is,
working colors together that aren't
usually associated with each other.”’

Nat’s works are soft and pleasant
to the eye. The abundance of its
personality makes it appear that he
is working backward from abstraction
toward representation, not in terms of
imagery per se, but in terms of
energy. His energy is not frantic, but
controlled. Nat’s forms seem to drift
off the canvas.

art majors reveal inspiration in

Patti Smisson

The-use of bright color is a way of
distinguishing Patti’s acrylic work.
She says that she likes ‘‘sharp color,
not muted tones, because the duller
tones are too muddy-looking.” Her
pri are mythological and classic,
and‘have a quality of their own. All of
her works evoke a strong sense of
power. ome :

George King

George’s huge ‘‘Self-portrait’’ was
the first thing that my eye focused on
when I walked in the gallery. His
colors are vaguely reminiscent of
Matisse and Gauguin. His ‘“‘Dormi-
tory Window”’ evokes a nostalgic
feeling unique in its own way. The
paradox of this painting is that the
several self-effacing collaged strips
are unifying elements. They also
provide visual punctuation, in their
generally asymmetrical placement,
organizing and counterbalancing
large areas that otherwise seem
bland.

Finnish fabrics brighten Union

designs catch your eye with their
carefully cordinated colors and ori-
ginal contemporary composition de-
rived from nature.

Isola, a native of Finland, is one of
Marimekko’s four designers, contri-
buting some 400 designs (copied from .

Oe, eY Sayan @,

her paintings) to the company. It has
been said that she will be known as
one of the greats in 20th century
textile design.

In Finland one sees her designs on
window shades, cafes and on people.
Marimekko is a common word in the
country and Isola is a national
heroine.

Recently Isola moved to Boone,
N.C., where her associations with
Marimekko and her art will not be
interrupted. She paints the designs on
ten-meter rolls which are easily
mailed and comments that the de-
signs are first paintings, then fabrics.
The Appalachian mountains are an

. excellent inspiration for this woman

‘who works from nature.

We tend to equate brighitecolors
with frivolity and cheeriness, but
Isola’s works are bold, personal
interpretations. Her manner is de-
mure and calm and like a muse,
quietly arouses people’s feelings with-
out their knowing how.

Isola will be in Charlotte Saturday
afternoon, April 23 at Le Masters

LOVE $1.00

Laura's show of five silk screens, a
diverse collection done over the past
year, looks as though the artist’s
intent was that each aspect of her
abstraction—surface, color, shape,
and line—be as distinct and as full of
personality as possible to the point of
conflict between the elements.

Laura appears to count on the
conflict of unlike qualities to give her
work its appeal. These works, a little
like nervous teenagers, are alternately
ingratiating and antagonistic, soph-
isticated and dopey.

Paula Schmidt

Paula’s presentation of only one
painting made it difficult for me to
make any valid evaluation of her
work. Even so, Paula has a good
sense of color, a sense of elemental
profundity, a self-aware-sophistica-
ted-primitivism.

’ Steve Kimmel

Steve predominantly works in oils.
His subjects range from multi-toned
field paintings to gargantuan deep-
colored forms, The canvasses he
presented in the show are all done in
very bright pigments—a silver green,
a dark maroon, a pale mauve, a sky
blue permeated by a red blush.

The surface of his painting “Tissue
Dreams” glitter, like water catching
the light at an angle, yet they have
the solidity of the highly wrought. It
looks (as much as I-hate to use this
word) organic—like snakeskin, except
for the warmth imparted by Steve’s
rich colors and the evidence of his
concentration.

where her fabrics are on sale. Presen-
tly exhibiting at Wachovia National
Bank, Isola will also be having a show
in New York City this summer.
