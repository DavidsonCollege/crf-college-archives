Religion Department Debate

Davidson—Thomas Friedman,
New York Times columnist and
author of The World Is Flat, will be
speaking at Davidson this Novem-
ber. His arrival however has caused
quite the controversy between the
Religion and Physics departments
at the last faculty meeting. Many
in the Religion department believe
that Freidman’s speech will finally
cement the theory that the world is
indeed flat.

Lewis Grant, professor of reli-
gion, cited this picture as evidence
against a spherical Earth.

“About 500 years ago it be-
came quite posh to believe the
world wasn’t flat. Some unac-
credited scientists came up with
pretty radical and unbelievable
ideas when you think about it. We
have been saying the world is flat
way before the last half millennia,”

Parents’ Weekend 2009 has
come and gone, but its aftermath
lives on in the traumatized minds
of all involved.

“My dad won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1996; he’s a pretty smart
guy,” said freshman John Ramos-
Horta yesterday. “But he burst into
tears when I took him to my inter-
national politics class. He passed
me a note that said, and I quote,
“WAT THE F**K IS UR PROF
TLKING ABOUT I M SO CON-
FUZD’.”

“My mom spent hours cry-
ing over the homework from my
philosophy class,” scoffed junior
Flora Hamm. “She sobbed that she
didn’t know why she and my dad
had sent me here in the first place,
and withdrew me the next morn-
ing, demanding a refund. She said
that any school with student stan-
dards as high as they are here at
Davidson should only be attended
by superhumans.”

said Lewis Grant, an associate
professor of Christian Theology.
“In most religious texts it says the
world is flat and now we finally
have another voice in academia on
our side. I will be very interested
to see Freidman’s empirical data
to prove the world is flat. Fried-
man is going to lambast all the non
believers.”

“Who are you going to
believe, Copernicus or
God?”

In the meeting Physics de-
partment chair Donald Roosevelt
commented, “I cannot believe
this is up for discussion. Why
are we talking about something
that was disproved in the Middle
Ages? The title of his book of his
book is a metaphor for the cur-
rent state of the global economy.”
A smug Grant sniped back, “We
will see about that. Have you
seen the cover of the book? Who

are you going to believe, Coper-
nicus or God?”

The score will be settled
when Friedman gives his lecture
this November. Grant com-

mented, “I see this as part of a
larger trend in academia to return
to more traditional beliefs. Finally
we will disprove the existence of a
heliocentric universe, germs, and
evolution. I mean, does anyone
really believe humans came from
monkeys anymore?”

Parents’ Weekend Suspended Indef-
initely Due to Stressed-out Parents

“Both my parents had panic
attacks over the number of events
that were planned for them,” add-
ed sophomore Peter Little. “They
came to my classes, watched me
study for two tests and write a pa-
per; we went to see a play, ate in
Commons three times a day, and
attended a number of other activi-
ties, such as study groups, meet-
ings, and Court parties. They were
extremely displeased with the lack
of free time here at Davidson.
They want me to drop out and at-
tend a local community college.”

Parents’ Weekend has been
canceled indefinitely after such
negative feedback. “Obviously,
keeping parents ‘in the know’ has
proven disadvantageous for the
college,” stated President Tom
Ross in his announcement yester-
day morning. “When it comes to
agonizing their children, for some
parents, ignorance is bliss.”

Major Disappointment:

The Yowl’s Handy Guide

Major: Political Science

Reasons people choose this
major: They enjoy debating (read:
are naturally argumentative); De-
bating comes naturally to them;
They actually care about policies
and how they affect peoples’ lives;
They religiously watch CNN or
Fox News anyway; They got a
little too caught up in the Obama
craze.

Why people avoid this major:
They were raised to believe that
discussing politics is rude; They
hate statistics; The Electoral Col-
lege system.

Career options: Lawyer;
Political Pundit; Run for Office;
News Journalist; Business; Teach-
er; Think Tank; Governmental

Agency; Lobbyist; Selling cheesy
magnets of the Washington Monu-
ment on street corners.
Description: Poli Sci ma-
jors are those unique individuals
who really do know how laws
are made. They speak often and
loudly about economic upheaval
in Latin America or President
Obama’s health care plan. For
them, any location is a good loca-
tion to talk politics. They thrive on
debate, enjoy learning about power
struggles, and sneer at anyone who
cannot name all of their congres-
sional representatives. They often
dream about going to law school,
are fiercely invested in a political
party, and get a real kick out of
khaki pants and sweater vests.
