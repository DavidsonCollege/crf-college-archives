Che Re Elliott, Jr
pastor Of the Druid Hills Presby
terian church in Atlanta, Ga., con-
ducted the annual “Y” Fall Services
last week in a series of five meet

ings held last Tuesday, Wednesda

and Thursday

For the opening service on Tues
day evening, Mr, Elliott took as his
text Timothy I] 1:12-with-the ex
hortation that he came to speak not
ot.religion in general but’of Jesus
Christ in particular. “Is Jesus Christ

real to you?” ~was his challenging
question upon which he based the
principal part of his sermon. He
brought out the fact that although
one might be a sincere and proftes-
sed church Christian Christ was not
necessarily real to one. The import

ant point was so much what one
