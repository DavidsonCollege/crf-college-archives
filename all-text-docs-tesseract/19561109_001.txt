signified their interest in the
Y.M.C.A. program, This was com-
pared with last year’s member-
ship at this.time which was only
slightly more.

PLEDGES

However, the significant fact to

be noted is that although the mem-

r | bership total is running slightly be-

hind that of last year, the amount
pledged to the Y work is substan-

500 has been pledged, represent-
ing a net gain over last year’s
pledges of about $500. This in-
cludes only student pledges.

BIBLE CLASS

Considerabie discussion has
arisen concerning the proposal of
the Davidson College Presbyterian
Church to take over the College
Bible Class and to provide it with
both leadership and financial aid.

At the present time, the class -is
sponsored by the Y and is taught
by Professor McLane. It has been
noted, however, that the Presbyte-

Davidson that does not sponsor
a denominational Sunday School
Class.

struction of the Literary Hells. The original chandelier of the
Hall is seen over the case containing the history and bottle found
by workers during the recent construction work.

IN RENOVATED HALLS

Literary Societies
Hold First Meetings

This week saw the first meetings of the Philanthropic and
Eumanean Literary Societies for the year in the recently re-
constructed halls. This reconstruction was made possible
through a gift by Mrs. Lillian Hodson of Orange, N. J.

EU MEETING

The first order of business for
the Eumanean Society was the di-
recting of the secretary, by Presi-
dent Bill Daniel, to write a letter
to Mrs. Hodson, benefactress for
the reconstruction, thanking her

for her contribution.

President Daniel then appointed
Creighton Peden and Tom Morgan

ed her for the building dedication
was then read.

The evening program was given
by Phil Kukura, who spoke on the
topic, “Should an ancient language
be required for the AB degree?”
After his address Kukura con-
ducted a discussion pertaining to
the topic.

At the conclusion of this dis-

as chairmen of the membership and |cussion, President Daniel adjourned

publicity committees, respectively.

Carmichael fo Speak
About Integration

Dr. Omer Carmichael, superin-
tendent of the Louisville, Ken-
tucky public schools, will speak
to the student body in chapel on
Thursday, November 15.

Dr. Carmichael will explain how
and why the Louisville schools
were integrated this fall. This
topic has recently appeared on
television networks and in Time
and other weeklies.

BACKGROUND

Dr. Carmichael was born in the
Deep South—in the small town of
Hollins, Alabama. He went to the
University of Alabama. He has
served as superintendent of vari-
ous schools in the South—Tampa,
Florida and Lynchburg Virginia,
among others before coming to
Louisville eleven years ago. Dr.
Carmichael started to lay the
groundwork for an integrated pro-
gram almost as soon as the Su-
preme Court issued its decision.

His educational campaign carried
Dr. Carmichael to service clubs,
welfare groups, civic organiza-
tions, parent-teacher units, and to
industry, labor, and farmers. He
earnestly urged acceptance of the
new policy.

LOUISVILLE SCHOOLS

As it turned out, the majority
of Louisville schools are on an
integrated basis. Of the city’s sev-
enty-three schools, fifty-four are
mixed. Forty-one elementary,
eight junior high, and five senior
high schools contain both Negroes
and whites. It would be impossible
for a white parent to seek a trans-
fer to an all-white high school
for his child since of the six
secondary schools one is all-Negro
and five are mixed,

Dr. Carmichael will hold an in-
formal coffee discussion in the
Union for all interested students
after his talk in chapel.

Freedom highlighted this weck's
student council meeting last Mon-
day night.

Resulting from the need for..in-
creased understanding between the
students behind the Iron Curtain
and those in America, the Crusade
for Freedom program is requesting
certain colleges to conduct educa-
tional programs among its stu-
dents. After thorough discussion,
the council passed a motion in fa-
vor of having such a program in
the spring.

CRUSADE

The crusade to be held on the
Davidson campus will include a
movie, speaker, and even some
mock propaganda balloons such as

to those behind the Red lines. To
the school staging the best crusade,
a full, one-year scholarship to study
in Munich, Germany, will be given.

STUDENT FORUM

President Dan LaFar reported
that progress was being made on
the Davidson-Cornelius telephone
problem and that attendance at the
mock, Student Legislature conven-
tion in Raleigh, November 15-17,

would be open to the student body.

The question of honor-binding
fraternity presidents to report
drinking among their brothers on
dance weekends was discussed and
referred to a later meeting.

The council discussed the sleep-
ing arrangements of both Negro
and white delegates to the regional
United Students Christian Council
conference to be held at Davidson
over the Christmas holidays. The
college staff is attempting to iron
out the problems that have arisen.

growing spirit of national interest
and “nationalism,” which he de-
fined as “thinking in terms of be-
ing a member of a nation” before
being a Communist or anything
else, The action of the Hungarians
was given as an example.

In his speech, Ford explained
the viewpoints of each of the

ae rste'=| College’s Editorial Crew

In answer to a question, Ford
said that there was “a high de-

made that these be separately pub-
licized in the Davidsonian for the
benefit of the entire student body.

Homecoming came up for its
share of discussion and the council
delved into the curfew question,
now extended to 4:30 a. m. on Fri-

day night, together with the sub-

jects of parking on campus and the
double-cut rule for Vespers.

Praise was extended to the Court
of Control and the upperclassmen
for the fine manner in which orien-

tation was conducted.

Senior ROTC Students
To Get Orders Earlier

Seniors entering the Army fol-
lowing the completion of the ROTC
eourse will be notified at a much
earlier time this year as to the
amount of service they will be re-
quired to give and when they will
start.

In the past students were not
notified of their obligations and
date on which they would start
until just before graduation. Some
are given a six month tour of duty
while others are requtred to serve
two years. Because of this late
date for announcing to the senior
his position with the Army, many
have found it difficult to plan their
coming year.

Major General Herbert M. Jones,
Acting Adjutant General has said
that the Army is “making every
effort to insure that each senior
ROTC cadet who is to graduate in
June will receive his orders ma-
terially earlier than in past years,
and will be fully informed as to
the dates and duration of his ac-
tive service.”

as Nasser had indicated he would.
In Egypt, Nasser and his generals
are part of the social revolution
which displaced Farouk and now
are in a very shaky position. Nas-
ser claims that Israel has no legal
right, since the invaded land is
Arab territory.

MOTIVES

As Ford puts it, “The British
have taken a lot of guff from
Egypt,” and they must keep the
Canal open, for 80°. of their oil
comes through there from the
East. France is afraid of a. flare-
up in North Africa, with national-
ist leaders there following Nas-
ser's example. They primarily do
not want a repeat of the Indo-
China affair, which ended in de-
feat and loss of prestige for
France.

HUNGARY

Switching to the revolt in Hun-
gary, Ford said that ‘the common
denominator of nationalism runs
all through this. Even the Hun-
garian Communist Army thought
of themselves primarily as Hun-
garians,” as they fought against
the Russian troops.

“I feel sure that a major Sovict
decision of the most far-reaching
kind has been taken in the last
three or four days, to tighten the
screws in Eastern Europe regard-
less of the costs: the driving of
the U. S. back closer to British
and French allies. and the undoing
of much of the imagery of “peace-
fulness” that the USSR had created
for itself in much of the world.”

USSR MOTIVE

Ford said, Russia’s reason for
this is to secure its stake in East-
ern Europe, even at the‘ expense
of its former policy goal to divide
the U. S. from its allies and to
seduce uncommitted countries.

gree of possibility” that the Soviet
action indicates a major power
shake-up. He called it “quite con-
ceivable”, thal we might see a*new
premier or a new head of the
party.

~ Another question was.” How will

Tito figure in the latest action?” ,.

Ford answered that Russia has
spent the last three years trying
to woo him back into the fold. and
this will “help to worsen their re-
lations with Tito. Yugoslavia will
probably be ‘less middle-of-the-
road-ish’' and will come back closer
to the U. S.”

U. S. PRESTIGE

Ford concluded by saying that
our prestige “is probably higher
now,” because of our stand con-
cerning the French and the
British on the Egyptian situation.

Dr. Ford was sponsored by the
Round-Table Committee of the
Student Union under the leader-
ship of Leon Howell.

Sigma Pi Sigma Bids

Dr. Bernard, McLane:

Sigma Pi Sigma, physics honor
society, held its third meeting of
the year last Tuesday night. At
that time two faculty members
were received into membership:
Prof. McLane of the physics de-
partment, and Dr. Bernard, Pro-
fessor of mathematics.

After making plans for a trip
to North Carolina State College
to tour the physics and engineer-
ing departments. the group en-
tered into an informal discussion
of graduate study in physics at
various schools.

Hits Paperless Cleveland

This is a recorded telephone conversation by Jim Batten,

editor of the Davidsonian:

CLEVELAND, November 8, (via
jwirey Rain, scattered snow flurries:

itorial contingent touched down in
iCleveland at dawn this morning,
' The Associated Collegiate Press's
‘thirty-second annual conference

spacious Hotel Statler tonight. It
jwill run thrdugh Saturday night.

Upwards of 800 delegates from 35
stutes, Canada. and the District of
Columbia. representing most of the
nation’s college publications flocked
linto town today.
+ Bob Carmichael, Bob Beall, John
, Trask, Bill Bondurant, John John-
son, and myself compose the David-
‘son delegation.

PERT HOSTESS

Eastern Airlines got things off to
a smooth start, providing quick
two-hour air service from  Char-
lotte’s Douglas Airport to Cleve-
land. and a pert 21-year-old hostess
who said she had been to a David-
json dance weekend.
| Amazingly enough to this group
'of semi-country boys, getting to
the Statler from the Cleveland-
Hopkins airport by way of a com-
bination of busses, trolleys, “rap-
ids,” and five blocks on foot took
fifteen minutes longer than did the
non-stop flight from Charlotte.

NEWSPAPER STRIKE
- Ironically enough. for a city en-

tertaining a national press confer- |
ence, Cleveland has been without ;

newspapers since November 1 due
to a strike which has effectively
sileneed the citv’s presses.

Papers imported from New York, '

Pittsburg, and Chicago are up for
grabs at 8 a. m. each morning. but
the stacks dwindle rapidly and are
usually gone within a half-hour.

In an effort to keep the populace
up to date on momentous events
occurring at home and_ abroad,
many fashionable show windows in
the main business section feature
neatly-typed ‘up-to-the-minute news
bulletins.

A red-headed waitress with the
typical grating. twanging voice,
summed it up like this: “You just
don’t realize how much you need
a newspaper till you can't get one.”
In this newspaper-hungry city. even
Davidsonians would fine a ready
market.

Students will have the opportuni-
ty to have a chest x-ray made No-
vember 19, 20, or 21. Ordinarily
this has been a part of the regular
physical exam of the college re-

eee of each returning student.

This year. because of it being
impossible for the mobile x-ray
unit to be in Davidson at that time,
this time has been set. It is neces-
sary for the college to have a rec-
ord of this x-ray. before Thanks-
giving.

Those who are not able to have
the x-ray made during this time
are to go to Charlotte for the check
before the Thanksgiving holidays.
Otherwise, the student will not be
allowed to return to the campus.
