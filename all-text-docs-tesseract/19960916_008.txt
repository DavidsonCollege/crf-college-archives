I would like to take a moment
to address Mr. Hayworth’s reac-
tionary and disturbingly thought-
less article from last week, “Tra-
dition or Safety?,” in which he
argues against the installation of
I.D. card readers on the doors of
Chambers. His argument literally
posits the question of whether the
safety of the student body or the
maintenance of tradition is amore
important issue.

At first I could not believe
that this could ever actually be
considered acontest. More shock-
ing than that, however, was his
own ruling on the matter. I would
like to think that he was not seri-
ous in what he wrote. That he
couldn’thave been. ButI canonly
assume that he was, and must
therefore object.

Tradition, as we all know, is
by its very definition rooted in an-
tiquity — an old custom, born and
nurtured in a time distant from our
own. Such customs often are won-
derful.

They add fullness, complex-
ity, and a strong sense of identity
and history to an institution, If it
can be afforded —that is, if they
remain positive or, at worst, in-

nocuous ideals —I feel we should

continue to embrace them. But
what price the glory of a wide open
Chambers?

Times, as they say, have
changed. Perhaps Mr. Hayworth
has never attended ““Take Back the
Night,” in which female Davidson
students share their own stories of
rape and other sexual assaults —a

. number of which occurred on this

very campus. Even if one were to
argue that the incidence of rape,
assault, and battery on this campus
has not increased over the past
seventy years (despite a great
amount of evidence that it has),
one is forced to admit, at least, that
we are more keenly aware than
ever of its occurrence. These are
the stories we cannot ignore.

These are the stories which
remind us that the Campus Police,
as fine a force as they are, cannot
possibly be there to prevent every
crime on campus, and that self-
defense training in no way guaran-
tees safety.

These are the stories which
remind us that the fact that an inci-
dent of violence in Chambers has
never been reported does not mean
it has not occurred nor could not

occur.

I personally feel perfectly safe
in Chambers late at night, as do
most of the students I know. But
must we wait for the first incident
to be reported before taking pre-
ventative steps? And are the pre-
ventative steps Mr. Hayworth sug-
gested — surveillance cameras, an
increased police force —truly any
less detrimental to the sense of
openness on this campus?

Let merephrase my first'state-
ment. I would not so much charac-
terize Mr. Hayworth’s article as
thought-less as I would naive.
Believe me, I do harbor some of
the same sentiments. I love an
open Chambers and often take ad-
vantage of its silence and avail-
ability for late night studying. But

that privilege is not being denied

Educating Joseph

Joseph Hayworth, in his ar-
ticle of last week, titled “Safety or
Tradition” presented an extremely
misinformed and poorly structured
argument. He argued that keycards
should not be installed on the doors
of Chambers. I shudder to think
that this obviously misdirected
young man received an upbring-
ing that raised him.to believe that
the possibility of people being as-
saulted in a widely used college
building does not compare to his
ideas of tradition. Maybe it is the

inconvenience ofreachingintohis -

back pocket for his student ID that
truly bothers him. I’m not slam-
ming on his momma or his reli-
gious faith, I just have to wonder
what his environmental cues were
to guide such judgement. I’ve de-
cided that I should just put it down
to the fact that he hasn’t been here
very long.

Here’s a quick education for
you, Joseph. If you have the im-
pression that no one has been as-
saulted in Chambers “since it was
built” you seriously are under the

spell of Davidson’s bubble effect.
I know women have only been
here for twenty-two years, but
there are many kinds of assault.
Yeah, no rapes were reported on
campus last year.

This doesn’t mean that they
weren’t committed. Chambers is
not a great bulwark of safety. I
highly recommend that you at-
tend Take Back the Night during

Women’s Month in the Spring. If
you can’t wait, speak with Georgia
Ringle. She’ll be very informative
and patient with you. As for your
rhetorical query that attempts to
establish that “most female stu-
dents [have] been offered courses
in self-defense,” I refer you to a
friend of mine who said, “ Yeah,
what are we supposed to do, karate
chop our way down the hall?” Now
whether or not Bruce Lee is in the
house is when she is walking down
the hallway of Chambers at 4 a.m..

We should remember that it is

our keycards that allow us to leave .

our dorm rooms unlocked through-
out the day. If any of you want to
break into my room, tough luck.
I’m living off campus this year. It
isn’t simply our keycards that al-
lows this amazingly bad habit of
leaving ourrooms unlocked to per-
sist but Davidson College’s phi-
losophy is changing, it is certainly
changing for the better. I applaud
the efforts of the student govern-
ment, professors and especially the
campus police all os whom, in the
past, have lobbied for. increased
campus lighting and other safety
measures. Okay, so they might
have gone a little overboard with
Apartment F.

I’m glad to see that Joseph
Hayworth utilized critical think-
ing and proposed alternate solu-
tions. Unfortunately, the cost of
hiring more police officers far ex-
ceeds the cost of keycard installa-

tion. Surveillance cameras bespeak
“big brother is watching you.”
Multiple and specific keycard ar-
eas would involve more cost than
just the few needed at the main

‘entrances and handicapped access

door.

Hayworth’s implication of an
adverse reaction by the town of
Davidson to implementing
keycards on the doors of Cham-
bers is unfounded. As. far as I
know, there were no riots or pro-
tests when Davidson installed
keycards on the dormitories.

I don’t think anyone from the
town will cast their eyes in another
direction when passing us on the
street when the keycards are put in
place. I also disagree that Cham-
bers is the “last remaining symbol
of what all of Davidson used to
be,” or that we are destroying it.
Look around, you’l|l see hundreds
of examples of symbols of the
Davidson tradition. Each one of us
is an example.

Perhaps I am generating para-
noia. I could be a little bitter or
overly militant. The thing of it is,
I don’t want any more of my fe-
male friends telling me that they
were raped or “taken advantage
of” in any way in ANY building.
We need to remember that the fa-
mous bubble that surrounds this
school may be reflecting rainbow
but the film is thin. Sorry, poetic
license (thanks Owen).

Thats why I find it disturbing
as American politicians find it in-
creasingly convenient and popu-
lar to bash judges for “coddling”
defendants... “(s)he receives
Christmas cards from the ACLU.”
Christmas cards they might be
getting, but bowbeating the judge
sets a dangerous precedent. To

paraphrase Gerry Spence, what
might strike you as absurd loop-
holes for others become your sa-
cred constitutional rights when you
are told “will the Defendant please
rise?”

And thats why I would like to
remind you that when “the crook”
screams from the docket (yes, even
OJ) that he is innocent, he MIGHT
be. Presumably he will be pun-
ished for his crimes. But as hu-

mans, we owe it to each other to at
least listen to what he says to say.
— Audi Altrum Partum — always
hear both sides.

. And for lesser offences, let us
remember Dr. Johnson “God Him-
self Sir, does not propose to judge
Man till the end of his days.” Per-
haps we neither should we.

us. Moreover, I hate the thought
that the installation of card readers
in Chambers marks a compromise
in our trust both of the student
body and of the community. But
the community is growing rapidly
around us; and although most do, a
handful of our students do not al-
ways behave honorably.

‘In conclusion, let me state my
firm conviction that the heart of
this college is its student body (and
faculty), not its sense of tradition.
The latter is adornment—lovely,
but not essential. How selfish of
me to value it over others’ well-
being! The college must take ev-
ery step necessary to ensure the
safety of its students. And if cer-
tain measures require the loss of a
little tradition, so be it. Itis asmall,
small price to pay.

In Response to the
Amazing Technicolor Opinion

I must admit that the first time
I heard about Chambers and card
access was when I received an
article, by Joseph Hayworth, for
editing. The primary concern of
the author is that tradition is being
abrogated by security measures and
that the addition of “keycards” to
Chambers is emblematic of the
end of some sort of era at Davidson.
Mr. Hayworth asserts that “If no-
body has been harmed, injured, or
otherwise assaulted in Chambers
after hours since it was built, why
are these actions needed now?”

I will tell you why. Itis impor-
tant to realize that an incident of.
assault and a reported incident of
assault are two very different
things. Many incidents of violence
are unreported. This is especially
true of acts of agression against
women. As a survivor of sexual
assault, I can speak to that directly.
I never even told my parents what
happened to me, so what makes
anyone think that a woman would
report an attack?

’ Mr. Hayworth makes it clear
that it is women for whom these
locks are being installed. He asks,
“haven’tmost female students been
offered courses in self-defense?” I
haven’ t. Self-defense can help, but

it sure as hell won’t stop rape. Or at
least it didn’t stop mine. What
would have helped me a lot was if
the place where I was raped had
been locked.

As well as being petty, misin-
formed and sexist, the essential
argument of this article is at fault.
An unlocked Chambers is not “the
last remaining symbol of what
Davidson used to be.” It is not a
bastion of safety awashed in the
glow ofarosy southern tradition. It
is a dangerous anachronism. How
can anyone possibly venture that
tradition is more important than
the safety of Davidson students.

Locking Chambers at night
will not wreak proverbial havoc
upon our friendly southern insou-
ciance. Nor will it push away tradi-
tion. This school has so much south-
ern tradition that a misplanted
northerner like me would like to
see it relax a bit.

We cannot create a new
Davidson rife with ideological fer-
ment, although I wish sometimes
we could. However, eliminating
attitudes like that which was ex-
pressed in the previous issue should
facilitate the growth of an atmo-
sphere a bit closer to Utopia than
Mr. Hayworth’s perfect view.
