Course selection time is upon
us again. Immediately I think back
to late August, standing innumeric
order waiting to enter the esoteric
world of Drop/Add. When I fi-
nally gotin there I remember over-
hearing a group of frenzied fresh-
men who were all trying to get a
biology class. They were having
the following conversation:

FROSH 1: (screaming across
the room) Does anybody have a
Bio 111?!!

FROSH 2: I have a Bio 111.

FROSH 1: You do? Well, Pll
trade you a Chemistry 115 for it!

FROSH 3: Wait! I'll give you
an Chemistry 115 and Anthropol-

you a Physics 135, Spanish 201,

FROSH 2: A secret decoder
ring? O.K.!

Actually, Drop/Addis the easy
part. The most difficult thing about
course selection is actually choos-
ing the course because weall know
that the courses we take in the
second semester of our Freshman
years will determine the outcome
of our entire life. This is a proven
fact. A recent Gallup poll (12,434
people surveyed, 12,420 wrong
numbers) printed in the bottom left
hand corner. of the USA Today
stated that the number one reason

Frampton Rules:

On Zits and the Presidency

What is the deal? I thought
that once I got to college I was
supposed to grow up. I thought I
wasn’t supposed to get zits any-
more. I was wrong, dead wrong.
(Oooohh.)

Case in point: In high school,
Thad a nightly tradition of popping
zits before I went to bed and wip-
ing the puss on my mirror. I was
always worried that if I let a zit

"grow over night it would turn into

a gigantic, white, light bulb on my
face that said, “Run away, run
away.” Each and every night I
went through this ritual telling
myself with an almost fatalistic
sigh that this would all stop once I
went to college.

Well, as I aiready said, I was
wrong, dead wrong (oooohh) and
my roommate really hates looking
at the mirror.

Now, I want to pause here for
asecond and explain something to
those clear complexion little. bas-
tions of worm puss who never get
zits. It is normal to pop the dern
things. If we didn’t you’d have to
look at them, round and wart-like,
sticking out of our necksand faces.
So before you start getting all
grossed out, just remember this:
Our oily faces won’ tbe so stretched
out and wrinkly when we’re fifty.
While your chin is flapping back
and forth in the wind, ours will be
looking quite fine, thank.

Anyway.

I’ve been thinking of who to
vote for and whether or notI should
make that decision any of your
business. I spent many hours try-
ing to determine whether I should
share my incredible insight into
who would be best suited run the
country. But, to be honest, I don’t
think that’s fair. Besides, whoever
I told you to vote for would prob-

ably winand then the losing candi-
dates would blame the media for
influences the public. (That last
sentence was not an indication of
whom I am voting for.) I just
doesn’t matter who I am going to
vote for. It is your own decision.

I voted for myself. Now this
isn’t exactly an intelligent choice,

Chris Frampton

butno matter how you lookatit, no

candidate has exactly what I am’
looking for in just such a person.

The way I see it, I have a view on

every issue in the campaign. Hell,

as far as I’m concerned, I have the

right view oneverything they bring

up. So why shouldn’t I vote for

myself?

I just thought of something. I
don’t want to interrupt the rhythm
of this Wordsworth like prose, but
I think something needs clearing
up. We're not talking about the
race for the Penthouse-Pet-of-the-
Year here, we’re talking about the
campaign for president. Just

In Black and White:

Spike and Some Other Stuff

~ We’re ecstatic. You know
why? Someone (actually multiple
someones) _ chal-
lenged certain as-

The problem is that so many have
objections to conceiving of Afri-

thought I’d help out. Now back to
our main story.

AmI...

The campaign for the presi-
dent of the United States, idiot!

Now,am I encouraging you to
vote for me, too? Hell, no!. I want
you to vote for yourself. After all,
everybody has an opinion in what
should be done about the country,
or even if something should be
done about the country. Even the
people who just figured out what
we're talking about are already
screaming about why we should
fund Iceland’s search for the Lost
City of Atlantis.

The there is the trust issue.
Everyone wonders whether they
can trust the candidates. (Yes, I
think Candi would win Pet-of-the-
Year if we voted solely on trust.
Besides, who do you trust more
than yourself?

Of course, you’re probably
wondering how anyone would win.
Simple. There are plenty of people
who don’t trust themselves to.run
our country, not to mention the
people who don’t have enough

’ confidence to go to the bathroom

without calling their mother to sce
ifitis alright. These people would
vote for someone else. If two or
three people vote for the same per-
son, we'd have our president.

But what if someone evil like
Hitler gets elected? That’s easy,
kill him.

Just remember to vote for
yourselfand you’1l know you voted
for the right candidate. :

Oh, what was the connection
between zits and the presidency?
It’s just that I’m about as sick of
this campaign as I am of zits. (No,
Candy isn’t covering up massive
acne with makeup.)

Vote.

Americanmen donotface the same

problem with “the beauty thing” as
do African-American
women?

pects of our last col-
umn, which dealt
with the beauty of
African-American
women. We like
when this happens—
it shows us someone
is alive out there, and
it makes us think.
Some people thought
we were shallow in
our treatment of
women, because the 4
only good thing we
said about African-
American’ women is
that they can be beau-
tiful. We didn’t say

Deidra Montague &
Scott Windham

Anyway, we’re
not here to debate end-
lessly about beauty, but
about Spike Lee. So
what about Spike Lee?
We were disturbed by
some of the reactions
to his visit. Before he
came to speak here,
some people thought
that he was a racist.
These people did one
of two things: some
went to hear him; some
stayed home. To those
who went, good for
you. Even if your sus-
picions were con-

anything about per-

sonality.

We didn’t mean to portray
women in a negative light. We
were just dealing with one aspect
of unconscious prejudice. In fact,
most people have no objections to
conceiving of African-American
women with terrific personalities.

can-American women as Deauti-
ful.

We also didn’t mean to slight
African-American men by not in-
cluding them, What we said about
women applies to men, too. Is it
possible, though, that African-

firmed, you had some
good food for thought.
To those of you who kept your
minds sealed shut and refused to
go, pat yourself on the back for not
supporting a racist, and turn the ol’
key that locks up your little brain.
