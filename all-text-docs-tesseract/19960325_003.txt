New Life

By Brap D. Cuase

The picturesque asphalt walk-
way meandering between trees

hundred of years old in front of

Charles A. Dana Science Building
may soon be only amemory. How-
ever, the walkway and the trees are
not the, only things threatened by
the proposed Life Sciences build-
ing — commencement exercises
and tradition are also at stake.

The new Life Science build-
ing has been on the drawing board
for the last few years. Davidson
has seen a substantial increase in
the number of students involved
with Biology, and the current fa-
cilities are not only small, but out-
dated as well. The new Life Sci-
ence building is meant to solve
both of these problems.

The current proposal puts the
new building directly in front of
the existing Dana Science build-
ing. Vice President of Academic

Sciences building will move graduation

Affairs and Dean of Faculty, Rob-
ert Williams, commented that the
new building “will take up most of
the space in front of Dana.” He
also cautioned, that the College
would “save as many trees as pos-
sible.”

However, no matterhow many
trees are saved, the traditional com-
mencement exercises would have
to be moved to another location.
“We hope to keep graduation on
the front yard,” Registrar Polly
Griffin says. “We have been look-
ing at areas at the end of Chambers
and the area to the right of the main
walkway,” she added.

Griffin also stressed that the

proposed Life Science building
would not affect graduation this
year. She was sympathetic with
concerns about the graduation cer-
emonies. “Commencement is per-
fect where it is — it’s a picture
perfect graduation location,” she
said. Malcolm Campbell, Assis-
tant Professor of Biology also ex-

posed building: “It will be sad to

Speaker Christine Hoff Sommers
creates controversy on campus

By CATHERINE ANDERSON
News Editor

Christine Hoff Sommers
spoke to an angry audience of
Davidson students and faculty
Tuesday .

Sommers spoke about anti—
intellectual, angry feminists, ‘call-
ing herself an “equity” feminist
who is pleased with the status quo.
She also addressed false statistics
used to perpetuate the women’s
movement. For example, several
publications cite the number of
anorexics who die each year as
150,000, but in reality, she
says,under 100 die each year.

“T thought it was good that
someone like that came to stir up
thought. She was very provoca-
tive, and I know she made a lot of
people mad,” says former Speaker’s
Committee Chairman Chris Currie,
who brought Sommers-to campus.

“I knew we had brought

thought someone on the opposite
end of the issue would be a good
idea to spark thought,” Currie
added.

Junior Charlotte Seigler found
Sommers’ presentation “very

unintellectual and unprofessional.
I felt like all she did was bash all of

the more radical’ feminist leaders: ©

One of her main arguments was
that feminist leaders pervert statis-
tics, making the situation look
worse than it is. But she did the
same thing.”

Sommers used a list published
from Cornell that addressed why
women should be angry at men but
did not acknowledge that the list to
which she referred was in response
to a similar publication on why
women should not be allowed the
freedom of speech. Many students
were angered at this.

“She called the list [on why
women should not be allowed free

speech] ‘funny,’ and ‘a joke,’ and
asked why we couldn’t see it as
that,” says Junior Joselyn Schultz,
Women’s Issues Committee Chair-
person. “She had no substance to

her argument and tried to turn femi- -

nism into two groups and that’s :

divide feminism down the mi
adds Schultz.

Some students agreed with
Sommers’ argument. “I don’t like
the feminist message that women
are always victims. I think we need
something more about empower-
ment,” says Junior Carrie
Blackburn.

Senior Bill Gullan found: the

audience disrespectful. “One could

have wished for a more powerful
and articulate exponent of her par-
ticular philosophy, and she was
perhaps too glib at times, but I
found some people in the audience
to be a little bit out of line.”

Williams also thought it very

realistic that the class of 1997 would
have commencement ceremonies
in front of Dana.”

We have only raised about

half of the necessary money and
the Trustees require us to have all
of the money for the building
pledged before they will let us
build.” He is optimistic that con-
struction can start in the summer of

: 1997 and will be completed in “less

than two years.”

Now, as the newly elected
president of the Honor Council,
she will work toward creating bet-

dents, faculty, and council mem-
bers.

She believes that freshmen-
are well educated about the code,
but thinks, “we need to remind
upperclassmen about the code at
the first. of each schoolyear.”

Hatfield also hopes to further
inform students about the regular
procedures of the Council. “I feel

confident in the Code,” she says,
“but at the same time I feel it

sucessor. “Given her experience
on trials and her unquestionable
motivation, I think that she will
do a great job,” he says.

“T think she wants to empha-

which is always important. I am
excited about Ann because I know
she will do well in the trials and
also outside of them with public
relations forthe council,” he adds.

Hatfield, from Jonesboro,
GA, has served on the Honor
Council since her freshman year.
