H OODROW WILSON RECEII'ES
PRESIDENT MARTIN.

(Concluded from Page 1.)

Conters With Educational Experts

While in) Washington, President
Martin also visited Dr. Claxton, United
States Commissioner of Education, and
together with Dr. Babcock, former Ex-

pert in Higher Education, who, for-
tunately. was found to be in the build-

ing at the same time that President
Martin was there, had quite a lengthy
informal conference on college matters
4n general. It was learned that no
official list grading of colleges has yet
been published, one having been started
and tentatively published, but held up

for some unknown reason by former
President Taft.
Both Dr. Claxton and Dr. Babcock

spoke very highly of Davidson, and
showed clearly the esteem in which. the
College is held in the higher educational
circles. President Martin left this con-
ference well satisfied with the work of
Davidson and re-assured that progress
is being made along sane lines.

After leaving W ashington, Presiden:
Martin spent some time in New York
and Princeton before returning to Dav-
idson.

ALUMNI NOTES.

J. D. Veal, of the Class of ’16, died
on the 16th of March, after a short
illness of only three days. He was en-
gaged in business at his home in Roy-
ston, Ga., at the time of his death.

In the Medical Department of the
John Hopkins there are seventeen meu
from North Carolina institutions, and
of this number, eight are Davidson men.
Only five colleges in the United States
have a larger number there than David-
son.

W. S. Golden ('13), has been made
President of his class in Union Semi-
nary. This is good, but not surprising
news as it is in the line of the excellent
record made by Mr. Golden while at
Davidson. He was a member of the
Debating Team of 1913-14 and Presi-
dent of the Y. M. C. A.

“Dusty” Sherrill (12) was in Dav-
idson Tast) Thursday.

The English Press hails President
Wilson as “the ereatest statesman of
the age.” This announcement is fol-
lowing his recent speech before Con-
gress. Perhaps it is well to remember
that the first training received by Pres-
ident Wilson in the development of his
wonderful oratorical ability. was when
he. took such an active part in the work
of the FEumenean Literary Society here
at Davidson.

OTHER COLLEGES.
UNIVERSITY OF N. C.

The University of North Carolina
will have as commencement speakers
Hon. W. C. Redfield, United States
Secretarv of Commerce; Dr. E. P.
Hill, of Chicago; Dr. O. E. Brown, a
teacher in Vanderbilt University The-
ology School, and Judge Van Wyck, of
New York. °

TRINITY.

The third Intercollegiate Debate be-
tween Trinity and the University of
South Carolina’ was won by Trinity
with a unanimous decision of the three
judges. The question was: “Resolved,
That the United States should main-
tain a position as one of the three lead-
ing nations of the world.” Trinity. on
the affirmative. was represented by G. S.
¢-xton, Jr.. H. E. Myers and B. W.
Barnard. The negative was defended
for South Carolina by T. A. Talbot, J.
S. Dudley and M. A: Wright. '

DARTMOUTH.

The: school authorities of Dartmouth
have been presented with $100,000 for
the purpose of building a theater.

STEREOPTICON LECTURE
THURSDAY. NIGHT.

New Y. AL. C. A. Cabinet. Has Been Ap

pointed—Orther Association Notes.

On Thursday night the regular Y.
M. C. A. meeting will be held in
Shearer Hall. Mr. E. G. Wilson,
State, Y. M. C. A. Secretary, will pre-
sent his interesting and _ instructive
stereopticon views of the Blue Ridge Y.
M. C. A. Conference. Mr. Wilson is
a very earnest, forceful speaker, and
comes fairly bubbling over with enthus-
iasm. Surely a treat is in store for all
the students, and they will do well to
take advantage of the opportunity of
hearing him.

Dr. Vines, of Charlotte, addressed
the Y. M. C. A., March 29, choosing
as his subject, ‘‘Habit."*- Dr. Vines di-
vided his discussion into three divisions
—The Power of Habit, The Perma-
nence of Habit, and the Possibilities of
Habit, treating each phase in an in-
tensely interesting way. Never have the
men enjoyed such a wealth of illustra-
tions so iluminating and so applicable
to the point in hand.

A notable improvement has been
made this year in the method of select-
ing Y. M. C. A. officers for the coming
vear. Heretofore the new officers have
been elected at the last meeting of the
vear, but this vear the officers for nex:
vear were elected last February. This
carly election has enabled the new presi-
dent to attend the Y. M. C. A. Con-
ference at Greenville, S. C., and to ap-
point his cabinet, and to lay plans for
next year’s work.

The new President is F. W. Price;
Vice-President, C. M. Gibbs; Treas-
urer, Roy Perry; Secretary, E. M. Cur-
rie.

The President has appointed the fol-
lowing cabinet: .

Chairman Mission Study Depart-
ment, Alfred Scarborough; Chairman
Bible Study Department, Norman John-
son; Chairman Devotional Committee,
W. A. McIlwaine; Chairman Member-
ship Committee, J. C.. Harper; Chair-
man Neighborhood and Personal Work
Committee, C. M. Gibbs;. Chairman
Publication Committee, P. D. Patrick;
Chairman Freshman Receiption Com-
mittee, Lex Klutz; Chairman Lyceum
Committee, J. E. Carter.

Meetings of the new Cabinet are al-
ready being held for the purpose cf
planning for next vear’s work. Because
of the earlier organization, each officer
is hoping to do better work next year,
and the outlook is bright indeed.

COMMENCEMENT GERMAN
PLANNED.

To Be Held In Selwyn Hotel.

Following the custom of previous
years, plans are being discussed for the
annual German to be held in Charlotte
at the Selwyn Hotel on the evening of
the 20th of May.

Although this is one of the biggest
events of the season, a recent call meet-
ing of the German Club was only slight-
ly attended. However, preliminary
matters were discussed and it was de-
cided to place the scheme before the
student- body. Consequently a meeting
was called after chapel last Tuesday
morning. Here the attention . of the
students was called to the fact that the
20th of May will be a big day in Char-
lotte, thus giving a favorable opportun-
ity to make this one of the best dance*
ever held, since everyone should want
to remain for that day anyhow. A com-
mittee on, arrangements was appointed,
and a business manager elected. These
men will soon be around to collect the
necessary guarantee which will be need-
ed before the hall can be secured and
before further preparations can proceed.
If everybody will sign up we can make
this one of the biggest and best dances
ever pulled off by a Davidson student
body. ber

“John D.” Smith is in the Infirmary
with a severe case of mumps and suff-
ering all the tortures of that pleasant
experience.
