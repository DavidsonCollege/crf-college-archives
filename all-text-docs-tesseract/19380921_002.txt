Our Policy...

All newspapers. both coliegiate and other-
wise, need a clear-cut poliey in handling both |

news and cditdrial matter. And we know
oi no better place than in this, the tirst issue
of a new collegiate year, to try to express

ce at Davidson, |
et nente-

ours.

The Dayidsonian is a student newspaper.
tinanced by stadent iees and put out by sat-
dent ctiort. Our aim will be to strive ior
the weliare of out owners the students of
Davidson. No matter how time-worn and ,
trite it may sound. we say that we ltirmly
believe our lirst responsibility is to the sta-
dents. We. are partieularly anxious: for

“every Davidson man to realize that this is |

—his paper. {f you think it is a good one, be
proud of it, ft not, telt us what you think
is wrong with it. Like all editors, we |
hope that our papet will be a popular one.
liowever, we realize our inability (o please
all, and when we take our. stand on certain,
questions, we hope that others will realize
it, too.

The columns of this paper are open to
anyone. Communieations for publication
are weleome. These communieations wiil
be published anonymously it the writer so
desires, but the editor must know the name
of the writer, sinee he is personally respui-

“sible for everything that is published. .

Weare constantly trying to make im-
provements in the paper and hope that you
‘will reeognize them as such. Steceeding .
the inimitable Chubby King we haveta gos-
sip columnist whom we bclieve will satisiy
the inost ardent keyhole fiends on the cam-
pus. This worthy will, however, write va-
der a nom de plume. and it will take a verit-
able Sherlock dlolmes to Successiully
idenuiy him. Your impartial movie column
wilt continue and the latest dope in Davwid-
son sports will be found in Sports Editor
Casalils column. We also plan. to present a
column onsnational atiairs, the purpose of
_which will be (o overeome one of our worst
faults— that of being so wrapped up in our
own narrow sphere of life that we take no
interest in what is going on outside.

t

Our hopes and aspirations ior the paper
are high. dut we can do little without the
wholehearted cooperation of- the adminis-
tration and the student body. - We most
heartily solicit it and hope that The David-
sonian witl come ip to our aspirations and
to your expectations.

To The Frosh...

Jtis a long-established custom in colleges __
lo greet the new mien each year with much .
advice, well meant bat often unheeded. And, —
although you Freshmen have already re-
ceived quite a bit of Ahis, we would like to‘
—add- our bit. A sesponsihilily, a great. re-

_ sponsibility, is yours. You are entering a
college that has long been famed for turn-
ig out right thinking. clean-living men,
the kind of men that our country and the
world needs today probably more than ever
before. It’s up to you to keep Davidson
at the top. Of course, your influence on
the campus doesn’t amount to much just yet,

a

Sunday School...

11 has been not inirequently said: that
Davidson men, although they:are coming
‘to a Chrisuian College where a decided em
phasis ig put upon religion, think ait too
“lithe about religious and spiritual matters”

There is on the carmpes a very active Sun-
day Schoo! vetfich grew last year under the
leadership ot 3!:.cica Mryant and John Maw-

" hinney into a thriving religions group doing
inuch good among the students and tilling a
great need here at Davidson. What better

“gay to spend Sunday morning than by
going to Sunday School: The programs
are attractively presented, with one of the
professors, among whom there are many
execlient Speakers, talking at cach.

A special note to Freshmen:2 Just be-
cause youre away trom home now and have
more freedom, don't iall out of the habit
of attending Sunday Sehool every week. It’s
a habit that vou will never regret having
formed. ‘ :
