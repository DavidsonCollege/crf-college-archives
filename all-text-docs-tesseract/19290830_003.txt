THE DAVIDSONIAN, AUGUST 30, 1929

SIDE LINE SHOTS:

How Monk Younger’s Gridpot
Looks

By “Felix”

As the wheel turns round to another fall
of the year expectant eyes of hundreds of
Davidsonians, past, present, and future, focus
themselves upon the turf of Richardson Field
and eagerly watch the developments there.
The reason for this intense interest is easy
to explain, Once again that veteran of many
battles, the one and only Monk Younger,
is drilling his gridmen, in an effort to shove
the Red and Black a little higher up the
ladder of collegiate football fame. Monk ex-
plains the mysteries of the forward pass, the
side step and’ the punt to his prospective
backs, while at the other end of the field
his colleague, “Tex” Tilson, line coach extra-
ordinary, encourages his aspiring cohorts
to hit ’em low. And supporters everywhere
wait to see just what that Red and Black
machine will do to uphold the fighting tradi-
tions of the past. =

Nobody expects Monk or Tex to
say anything about their footballers,
and the “touchdown twins” have run
true to form this season by hiding
away at mountain camps and saying
less than a cigar store Indian. Monk
did break down last week and confide
that he thought the morning was the
cream of the whole day; to wit:
football practice at 8 a. m., beginning
September 2. And Tex admitted that
the Carolina hills had given him some
brand new ideas for grass drill, which
is such an attractive feature of his
early training period. Beyond these
two declarations—nil.

Pre-season dope broadcast by that emi-
nent columnist, Mr. Ernest Milton, has
thrown many followers of the Wildcat into
a state of nervous agitation, and well it
might, for the sad tale of four letter men only
is nothing to consider lightly with Clemson,
Army and others in. the offing. However,
there is always sunshine to a dark cloud, and
in this case the reference is to a large crop
of very promising sophomores, all of whom
tip the beam at considerably more than the

average Wildcat of the past two seasons..

siderable shock, and we believe that it will
gain strength with every contest. To» be
brief, we prefer to cast our lot with the
prophets of optimism and say that things
are not so. bad as they seemed at first.

Fortune took occasion to
smile upon her Davidson interests
when she sent Captain Arthur Baker,
tackle and captain of last year’s eleven,
back for another campaign, and then
close behind came Andy Hewlette, one
of the old guard for fair. Both are
better men, and therefore become ob-
jects of curiosity on the local campus.
So Monk now can boast of six bona
fide veterans. Carolina has only seven-
teen this fall, a really pitiful number
to Chuck Collins, Tar Heel mentor.

Five Clashes to Take Place on
Richardson Field—Wildcats
Meet Army
With the meeting of Elon in the open-
ing tilt of ‘the grid season on September
21, the Wildcats will begin a card con-
taining some of the most strenuous as-
signments ever faced by Davidson grid-
iron warriors. No one of the ten contests
scheduled can be classed as a setup, while
several of the outfits that mix with the
Cats real contenders for
southern and national honors in this fall's
football scramble. -With five southern
conference teams to be met, two S. I, A,
A. outfits, and one intersectional tilt in
New York, the Red and Black machine
will be facing a schedule that is extreme-

The Wildcats expected to handle
the Elon warriors, but the early date of
this opening game makes the engagement
an uncertain from the Wildcat's
standpoint. Last season Davidson was
triumphant by 52-0, but Younger is not
letting his men take this as any manner
of omen, and the team will trot onto Rich-
ardson Field in
confident manner.

football season.

This end who developed a_ state-wide

member, and would have been eligile this

season. Therefore it will be Captain
Brock. ;
Although this Barium Springs boy

made his debut as a varsity player last
fall, and will be playing his second year
this season, his outstanding ability on the
gridiron won the admiration and confi-
dence of his colleagues, and they con-
ferred upon him the honor of alternate
captain, Incidentally, it will be the first
time in many years that a junior has led
a Davidson College eleven.

Brock’s stellar performance in 1928 led

writers as an all-state end, His most ef-

To Help Wildcats

“Doctor” colored
many years past, dropped into the office
of The Davidsonian with a message of
cheer and good wishes for the new. foot-

ball machine of Coach W. L. Younger.
Davidson men have watched with keen
interest the efforts of “Doctor” Charlie

to promote winning Davidson teams. He
is a leather-lunged rooter at all athletic
contests, his Justy yells and shouts of ex-
hortation resounding to all corners of the
field, and it no that Charlie

loved rabbit feet. Tradition that

“Yes, suh, we is bound to have a real
