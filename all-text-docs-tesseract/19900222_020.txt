PITCH PUCKETT, from page 18

health tipsand to encourage students to follow a more
physically and mentally sound state of being. Mark’s
condescending attitude has most likely sent people
running from the weight room than anything else.

I must say that have now lost any respect that I may —

have had for Mark as a journalist. In Good Health has
become a waste of space as even its author admits. I
also deeply regret the fact that you are seriously
considering Mark as your successor for next year’s
position as editor. Please prevent us from further
witnessing such a painful display of self adoration.
Get Mark Puckett out of the ring. And tell him to put
his shirt back on.

Dear Mr. Goodrum, Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Hagood,

If you think reading my articles i is a waste of your
precious time, then don’t read them.

Sincerely,

Lucia Kendall
