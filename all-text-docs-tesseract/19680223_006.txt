The Union has proposed as-

program budget for a special
activities foundation.

These funds wilt be made
available to the imaginative

to promote ideas and pro-
grams.

The Union administration
proposes that individual and
group initiative is enhanced
when students have direct

they originate.

Therefore, the foundation
is to be administered by a
board of directors, chosen
from certain student leaders
and from selected faculty
members.

Already. John G. Holland,
assistant professor of Eng-

has been criticized as lack-
ing direction and being too
vague in purpose.

“This entire program is
admittedly an experiment.
So for those who are satisfied
to be critical, there is plenty
to criticize,"’ McGavock said.

McGavock added that the
selection process had been
particularly severely  criti-
cized and admitted that it
needed review and probably
major changes.

McGavock also redefined
the purpose of the Richard-
son Fellows.

“The Richardson Fellows
program, as I see it, is an ex-
ploration of the ways and
means that may be developed
to discover in young men
characteristics generally as
sociated with leadership and
to bring these men to grips
with the pcoblems and chal.

statement.

process in an effort to make
it more representative, to
emphasize the summer _in-

important persons to discuss
issues with the Fellows and
the student body and to stress
group planning about a cen-
tral theme.

Council Passes
Safety Proposal

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

President Tom Earnhardt
proposed to the Student Coun-
cil Monday the formation of
a Campus Safety Committee
to discuss and act upon var-
ious safety problems encoun-
tered recently on the campus.

The council passed the pro-
posal unanimously but apa-
thetically. Earnhardt said he
thought the committee should
consist of three students, one
faculty member, Grover
Meetze, head of the physical
plant, and one person from
the maintenance department.

The idea arose from var-
ious problems which the
council has discussed recent.

White notified all depart-
ments employing sludent help

week.

The letter made note of
the fact that the business of.
fice will not increase each de-
partment’s budget to meet
the new wage requirement.
White added, however, that
with slight adjustment bud-
gets could still be met.

White also asked that as
many students as_ possible
should be relieved of jobs in-
volving interstate commerce,
which include producing, or-
dering or handling of any-
thing (including mail and
telephone calls) that come
in or go out of state.

to the Davidson department's
report.

The Donaldsons have four
children, a boy 17, a girl 15,
a boy 5 and a girl 2. The
youngest two were in the
house when the fire began.
One of the boys led his little
sister by the hand from the
house.

Dr.’ Raymond Martin, as-
sistant professor of philoso-
phy, has circulated a request
to faculty and administration
for aid for the family.

Martin said that there had
been some limited response
to his request for food and
clothing. He said there was
a special need for clothing
and shoes.

After the fire had been ex.
tinguished, George Hampton,
Davidson fire chief, and
Sigsby Tadlock, county fire
marshal, inspected the ruins.

Tadlock said that, ‘“‘We feel
sure that there was a petrol-
eum product scattered over
the center back room’ near
a heater. It appears to have
been the petroleum product
that was the accelerant.”

The fire marshal. stated

that this conclusion was
“based on the pattern of the
fire. It seemed to be a sur-
face ignition rather than a

deep burning fire."

“The initial accelerant
quickly took hold of the other
combustibles,"" said Tadlock.

Summer School

Cut To 6 Weeks

Summer school will run six
weeks instead of the usual
nine, Dean of the Faculty
Frontis W. Johnston said
Wednesday.

Sessions will run five days
a week from June 12 to July
2 and July 8 to July 27.
Exams will be the final day
of each session.

Science courses, however,
will either take a week long.
er or be taught six days a
week, Johnston said, in order
to account for labs.

Details of course offerings
are not yet available, accord-
ing to Johnston, because
plans are not complete on
summer research and grants
for faculty members.

clearance of the slick walks
during the January snow and
the inadequate lighting which
plagues parts of the campus
at night.

The Little fire in particular
has sparked comment. The
fire, which occurred in a
room on the third floor ear-
Mer this month, caused some
$3,000 in damages. Its occu-
pants have moved to another
dormitory.

tees until next Monday.
