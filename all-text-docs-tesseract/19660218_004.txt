Departments Change

Major Requirements

By BOB TRAVERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Changes in the requirements
for a major and a major with

honors in the English, German :

and History Departments have
been made.
These changes, effective with

the Class of 1968, will open the ©

honors program to more stu-
dents and should give the Dav-
idson graduate a broader under-
standing of the field.

REQUIREMENTS

The requirement for participa- ,

tion ‘in the honors programs of
all departments has been low-
ered from a 2.25 average to a
2.0 to permit. more students
who want to take the honors pro-
grams to do so.

“The honors program puts the
student more on his own,"’ ex-
plained Dr. Malcolm Lester,
chairman of the History Depart-
ment. ‘‘and we have more stu-
dents here now than previously
who want to work on their own
and who can greatly benefit: by
it.” ‘

HISTORY HONORS

The history major with hon-
ors will require 12 hours of semi-
nats dealing with: topics from
ancient history, the Renaissance
and Reformation, modern ‘Eu-
rope and Asia and other areas.
In addition. it will require six
hours of regular course work, six
hours of senior tutorial and
thesis and-a comprehensive ex-
amination.

“The thesis element, whieh is
new to the honors program, is
becoming possible now with the
development of the library.”
commented Lester. He also said
the History Department would
probably offer three seminars
each semester.

‘I hope and believe the
changes will increase the num-
ber. of students taking honors
work,” Lester continued.

MORE COMMENTS

Dr. Thomas Pinkerton, asso-
ciate professor of German, com-
mented that the German De-
partment has long been. inter-
ested in improving the honors
program because ‘‘we have stu-
dents here now who have been
asking for this type of work.”

“If a small liberal arts col-
lege has students who are able
and want to do research work,
then it must provide the oppor-
tunity for them to do so,” Dr.
Pinkerton continued.

A German major with honors
will require German 31-32 and
36 (or respective equivalent).
three hours from the senior the-
sis course with the remaining
hours from various seminar
courses and a comprehensive ex-
amination. The senior thesis
may give as many as six hours
credit; however, three hours
constitute the minimum require-
ment.

not reorganized its honors pro-

gram. Like the History and Ger-!

sing credit for foreign work.

Several students who went
abroad last year have experi-
enced such difficulties, particu-
larly with the Bible Department.
These students returned to Dav-
idson and learned that they
would be required to prepare a
10-15 page paper on the mate-
rial covered in each Bible course
before they could receive credit.

The students had not known of
this requirement while they
were in Europe, according to a
spokesman for the group, and
several of them have had diffi-

mester course in the history of
English drama.

“There are type courses in
poetry and thé novel. This is
an attempt to give proper con-
sideration to drama,’ Cumming
commented.

HISTORY CHANGES

The History Department will

majors to take six hours from
each of the following cate-
gories: ancient, medieval, Ren-
aissance and Reformation; Eng-
lish. modern European and
Asian; and American.

“The regular history major
has been changed to insure bet-
ter distribution of courses—and
still insure special concentra-
tion."’ Lester commented. ‘Most
history majors have done this,
so this change is just a guaran-
tee."

“It- will now be possible.’ he
added. “for the non-honors stu-
dents to take the seminar
courses if there is room.” There
is a limit of 10 students per
seminar:

WORK NOT SPECIFIED

Dr. T. A. Williams said that
the problem arose because]:
“work necessary to get David-
son credit was not specified in|.
advance. This was merely a
mechanical error and it has been
corrected.”

A special form has been pro-| |
vided on which each depart-
ment must now specify the re-
quirements for credit in a par-
ticular course aS soon as pos-
sible after the Davidson profes-
sors abroad send a list of the
courses offered at the foreign
universities. : -

Under this system, each stu-|{ Pes am an i

“But we had to have some evi-!

hoped that we would receive an.

professors, but we did not.”
