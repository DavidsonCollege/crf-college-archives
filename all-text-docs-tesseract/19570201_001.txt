Morton Accepts
Position At Virginia

Frederick S. Morton, chairman
of the Davidson College Depart-
ment of Business Administration,
assumed the position of a Research
Associate Professor, Graduate
School of Business Administration,
University of Virginia, effective
today.

For the next three years, Pro-
fessor Morton will be the director
of a special research project in
the effect of taxation on business
procedures and development.

Joining the faculty of Davidson
in 1952 after three years on the
Harvard faculty, he led in the
establishment of a new Depart-
ment of Business Administration
and became its Chairman in Jan-
uary, 1953.

After revising the curriculum in
business, he introduced the “core”
of courses required in all recog-
nized business schools in the coun-
try. Avoiding specialization at the
undergraduate level, he pioneered
the development and uses of the
“ease method” of learning. This
consists of substituting actual busi-
ness problems in the place of the
text book as the basis of all class
work.

Professor Morton commented
that he sincerely regreted the va-
eancy created in his leaving, but
indicated that he had discussed
with the Administration at various
times in the past eighteen months
the probability that he might be
leaving in the near future.

Patriot Hocsak Discusses
Communism In Hungary

By DABNEY STUART

“I don’t want to be a politician;
I just want to work.” With these
fervent words Istvan Hocsak elo-
quently expressed his feelings.

“A man knows good and evil.
A man does not need to know
other situations to know Commu-
nism is bad. Communism is pres-
sure: secret police, politicians, di-
rectors.

EDUCATION IN HUNGARY

“Communism says capitalism is
bad. Education of a Communist
starts in elementary school. They
teach one thing to a young man;
say it is good way.

“But then practice is different.
Teaching is not the same as prac-
tice. They teach Marx and Engels,
then Lenin, then Stalin. Doctrines
change as the men.

“I make forty American dollars
a month as an electrical engineer.
I spend twenty-five for food, two
or three for other needs, and ten
percent ‘bond’ for the Party. This
leaves me only six or seven dollars
for myself. “I work. My mother
and wife work. We have no time
for life.”

Equality is assured by the ten-
per-cent bond. But Steve empha-
sized the hollowness of “equality.”
“I am an exception. Most men
make only fifteen dollars a

ESCAPE

The journey which brought
Steve and his family across the
Hungarian border into a small Aus-
trian village is one of courage and
hope.

“There were two other families.
There were five children. We had
to carry them. The distance was
about twenty miles.

“It was raining and we had to
be very silent. There was much
danger.”

The muddy trek began at mid-
night and consumed five weari-
some, haggering hours. No trace
of bitterness or remorse mars
Steve's relation of his freedom
trip. He even chuckles as he tries
to describe the less of a shoe in
the mud during the long walk.

Some regret and nostalgia are
evident when the remembrance of
friends left behind gives him
pause. His mother’s two brothers
remained in Hungary.

lish language is amazing, and his

IMPEDED BY CONFLICTS
Key Problems Discusse
In Duplex System Plans

The construction of duplex units appeared inevitable
this week as planners for the proposed $250,000 fraternity
court attempted to match needs with available funds.

Tenative plans for the duplex
system will be submitted to the
Fraternity Committee -within the
next week. These plans provide
large dining and recreation areas
for each fraternity, separated by
kitchen facilities and quarters for
resident housemothers.

Two key problems face fratern-
ity and administration leaders as
they plan for the new court. The
most evident of these is financial.
At the present time, the college is
unable to finance the construction
of individual units on a new court.
Unless a source of financial aid is
discovered, there can be no new
fraternity housing if the duplex
system is not used.

The second problem which must
be solved is the disparity in the
size of the eleven fraternities now

on the campus. The impracticality
of building equal facilities for fra-
ternities whose memberships vary

ties both equal and constant be-
fore final plans can be made.
