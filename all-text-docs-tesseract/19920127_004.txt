THE DAVIDSONIAN

ELECTION '92 MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1992

1992 CATEGORY |

In order to provide our readers with the information required to make a wise choice in Tuesday's elections, the editorial board of the Davidsonian held a special forum
Thursday night at which the candidates for the SGA presidency, the SGA vice-presidency, and the Union presidency delivered speeches and answered questions from the board.
We have printed the transcript from that forum on the following pages, and we urge you to read the candidates’ statements carefully before you vote Tuesday. All photos for this

SGA Presidential Candidates

Dave Tonidandel

Hi, I’m Dave Tonidandel and
I’m running for SGA president.
Most of you don’t know me as a
politician, because I’m not one.
However, many of you do know
me as a Student who is willing and

able to take a strong stance repre- .

senting the interests of the
Davidson student body. In this re-
gard I view my lack of SGA expe-
rience as a positive rather than a
negative attribute. Not only will I
be a much needed blood transfu-
sion into the barely beating heart
of the SGA, but I have also not
been an accomplice to the heinous
crimes of unrepresentative voting
and inefficacy.

This school desperately needs
someone to represent student in-
terests. The president of the SGA
ought to act as a conduit between
the students, the SGA and the ad-
ministration; not merely between
an overly concessionary SGA and
its Overseeing masters, the Board
of Trustees and the faculty. Be-
fore I tell you why I am the best
candidate for the SGA presidency,
letmeask youone question; ““What
has the SGA done for you?”

Think about whether the SGA
has represented your best interests
or if it has simply become a self-
contained, self-serving, self-con-
gratulatory unit more interested in
appeasing the interests of an over-
bearing administration, Board of
Trustees and faculty. Here are a
few examples of failures by the
SGA to accurately represent the
interests of Davidson students.

Minus Grades. It is extremely
apparent that the minus grade sys-
tem is unpopular with a large per-
centage of Davidson students. Yet
minus grades whizzed through the

SGA, highlighting the fact thatthe .

SGA’ s dealings with minus grades
were largely ineffective and mis-
representative of student interests.

Shortened Exam Periods. In
shortening, by one day, the num-
ber of days for students to schedule
their final exams the SGA has
__deprived students of a desperately

needed day of study. Most stu-
dents felt that they needed this
extra day and by shortening the
exam period the SGA has again
misrepresented the Davidson stu-
dent body.

No Lofts in Belk. By not al-
lowing loft building in Belk dor-
mitory the SGA has taken yet an-
other freedom from the Davidson
student without any communica-
tion with the student body.

Unrepresentative voting. Due
to a severe lack of communication
between the SGA and the student
body there have been several is-
sues passed nearly unanimously
by the SGA when in fact large per-
centages of students fundamentally
disagree with SGA action. The
schism between student govern-
ment and student body will have
dire consequences if the current
pattern of misrepresentation is al-
lowed to continue.

Davidson college is at a turn-
ing point. With important issues
like F.L.A.G. and the alcohol pol-
icy the student body cannot afford
to be misrepresented or misin-
formed. The students of Davidson
deserve accurate representation and
I believe that I can provide the
leadership which the students of
Davidson College deserve.

Davidsonian: David, in the past
we have hada number of problems

' with kiosks for flyers to be posted

around campus. These problems
have been logistical or otherwise,
but the end result is that we still do
not have them and it is ridiculous.
I am not so concerned with the
kiosks themselves but rather with
other issues in the same vein like
institutionalization of recycling on
campus. How would yowas Presi-
dent go about doing these things
more efficiently?

Tonidandel: I agree with what
you’re looking at. What you’re
looking atisa deterioration of lead-
ership throughout the school. The
student body is apathetic as far as
dealing with the SGA. The SGA
has been unable to communicate
effectively with them. What is
neéded is a strong leader for the
SGA to communicate with the
students, not just the trustees and
the faculty but with the actual stu-
dent body and I think if that’s done,
then we’re going to getthese things
done.

Davidsonian: But communica-
tion’s not going to get things done
quite so quickly if it’s something
logistic and requires a bunch of

“grunt work and phone calls. Is that

the kind of leadership you’ re talk-
ing about?

Tonidandel: That’sleadershipand
that’s communication.

Davidsonian: Y oumentioned both
minus grades and shortened exam
periods and right now those are
things that the SGA is working on
as far as trying to reverse the cur-
rent policies. They weren’t things
that were passed by the SGA but

were passed by the faculty. What —

you think you could do differently
because I know the SGA has two
committees working on that right
now.

Tonidandel: The problem there
again is ineffective communica-
tion. The SGA did not communi-
cate effectively with the faculty in
saying that the Davidson student
body vehemently opposes these
plans that you want to implement.
By not saying that to the commit-
tees they allowed the committees
to bowl over the SGA and just pass
these.

Davidsonian: What other leader-
ship roles have you taken around
the Collegecommunity that might
have prepared you to be the SGA
President?

Tonidandel: I helped found
SHOC, the Student Health Options
and Concerns committee and I’m
currently treasurer of that organi-
zation. ve been a leader in Phi
Delta Theta: I was secretary last
year, pledge master the year be-
fore, and I was elected vice-presi-
dent this year. I’ve also been a
varsity athlete, and as you all know,
you have to be strong of character,
and a leader to be on a team.

Davidsonian: There’s beenagreat
deal of talk about racial tension on
campus this year. Do you see
problemsinrace-relations, and how
do you foresee the SGA dealing
with them under your administra-

tion?

Tonidandel: I think the student
body needs an outlet for communi-
cating their desires to the faculty
and the administration. I think that
there is definitely a problem

and it’s going to have to be solved
by the students, because that’s who
it involves most.

I don’t think the administra-
tion’s coming in and saying “we
need this committee, we need this
much funding, and we needa quota
of thismuch ‘whatever’” will solve
the problem. It’s really up to the
students.

I totally support the idea of.a
black fraternity coming to cam-
pus. Even in competition over
silly fraternity things, like egg-
fights, etc. I think that would
enhance race-relations just because

~ more people would be involved. -

Cunningham

Have you ever thought about
what makes the SGA different froin

_any other group on campus? It is

the only place where students from
many diverse groups are guaran-
teed a seat at table where campus
problems are tackled and solved.
Representatives fronvall over cam-
pus work together trying to make a
difference. I want to be president
of this organization because] value
that aspect. I have the necessary
vision, experience, commitment,
and discipline to fulfill my respon-
sibilities.

I have been involved in SGA

and other areas of campus long
enough to have a realistic picture
of the college. Although I love
Davidson, I know it is not perfect.
I have dreams for this school, not
as a problem-free college, but as a
place where the student body can
work. to make Davidson the place
it should be. The present intoler-
ance on campus doesn’t have to
remain. We the students need to
fightit ourselves, whether through
the Council on Minority Affairs,
Solidarity ‘Committee, or
Davidsonian editorials. We can-
not deny the role of alcohol in stu-
dent life, but we the students, not
the administration, inorderto form
amore perfect college, must work
through present means suchas the
Council on Campus and Religious
Life and Patterson Court Council
to make the necessary changes.
We must reverse the deterioration
of relationships among students,
faculty, and staff that result in
problems concerning academic is-
sues and perceptions of each other,

Over the past three years, I
have already been working to
change much of what is undesir-

able about the Davidson experi=

ence. As SGA President, I will
lead the students in solving prob-
lemsand communicating with the
faculty, administration, and trus-
tees. My background in working
constructively with others and my
experiencesas Vice-Presidenthave

_ both guided me in my decision to

run for this office. After three
years on SGA, I have participated
in-many of the areas already men-

tioned. Working with bylaws and
budgets, sitting on committees and
councils, and just talking with
people in all areas of campus has
prepared me to. work for us.

If we think Davidson should
be better, it can be. Last week,
Rev. Bernice King toldusthat when
students stand, a nation stands. If
we can influencea nation so much,
imagine what we can do here. She
also reminded us of our interrelat-
edness. When one person suffers,
all suffer, a concept especially true
in our small community. If‘we
ignore problems on this campus,
we are the victims. As President of
the SGA, I will work to keep com-
munication open, educating stu-
dents, and voicing their concerns.
Only then can we work together to
make this school the place it should
be

Davidsonian: The SGA hasn’t
been particularly visible around
campus this year. How. do you
plan to change that? Essentially
I’m asking you how your leader-
ship will differ from that of the cur-
rent president?

Cunningham: Maybe because of
our president this year, one major
focus of the SGA has been on rela-
tions with the trustees, and that’s
nota very visible aspect of student:
government.

I think there are a lot of fbn:
nels which could be used more of-
ten, such as DCTV. I tried tohave
a video made of all the SGA com-
mittee chairs, but that didn’t go
through the video department.
Another vehicle thatcould be used
is the Davidsonian. Whoever does
win theelection, I would urge them
to write something in the
Davidsonian about what’s going
on in the SGA. Rather than just
give a synopsis of the meetings, to
tackle aspecific issue and say “this —-
is what the SGA is doing.”

I feel like a lot of whatthe SGA
has been working on is still to
come as far as the committees are
concerned. We’re still going to
have a careers symposium; we're
still going to have a leadership
training event; and those are two
things which will be very visible
on campus. The minus grades
forum is also coming up, and I
hope that is something that will
make the SGA more visible. In
other words, a lot of what the SGA
has been working on. is. still’ to
come.

Davidsonian: What, specifically,
are the projects on which you have
been working this year, and what
do you want to Soro ia in the
future?

Cunningham: Right now, I’m
Sitting on the Council for Minority
Affairs, and under Prem, that’s
been going really well. I hope to
continue some of the work that
he’sstarted. Relationships between
