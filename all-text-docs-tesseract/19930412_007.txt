including Davidson Elementary
Tutoring, programs for senior citi-
zens, as well as Boy and Girl
Scouts. Reverend Shirley has also
worked to bring county and other
already-established services to
Davidson. Parenting classes, such
as “Wee Luv,” a preschool pro-
gram called Hooked on Phonics,
job training programs for teenag-
ers, the SHARE food program, free
health clinics, community devel-
opmentleadership training courses,
as well as health and child care
classes are all held at the Ada
Jenkins Center during the year.
Many members are excited that
the center is the new location for a
Head Start class, which will help

AJC Supports Underprivileged

disadvantaged preschool-aged
children in Davidson to better pre-
pare for school.

On weekdays, the cafeteria is
used for the Meals on Wheels pro-
gram for senior citizens from

Cornelius, Huntersville, and.

Davidson. Davidson Parks and
Recreation uses the gym of the old
school for summer and year-round
recreational activities forthe whole
community, ranging from basket-
ball games for children to exercise
and dance classes for adults.

Perhaps the most frustrating
aspectof Reverend Shirley’s work
has been trying to get more people
in the community involved with
the center. If you would like to get
involved, contact a Reach Out of-
ficer.

An Alum & Resident Reflects on Past

By William D. Vinson

My memories of the town of
Davidson and the college are based
on trips to Davidson to visit my
Aunt, Miss Maude Vinson, atten-
dance of a summer Music Camp
run by James Christian Pfohl, and
my college days in 1942-43 and
after World War II, 1946-48.

The size of thedowntownarea
as Iremember it was approximately
the same as it is today, but the
makeup was somewhat different.
The major attraction was a movie
theater located where the present
BP gas station is now. If one was
a serious movie goer, that was not

’ the place to go. The student body
in attendance would make their |

feelings known in a loud and rau-
cous manner particularly if the
show didn’t start on time or the
reels were mixed, The floor was
wooden and several hundred (at
least it seemed that many) pound-
ing feet along with derogatory re-
marks would match closely the db
sound level of present-day rock
groups.

Other differences included a
horse stable located about where
the back of the Habitat store is now
located. There, one could rent a
riding horse for an hour or two.
There was a Hardware store along
with several grocery stores that
would deliver. Additionally, the
White Drug Store that served real
milk shakes was located where
Tom Clark now has his store and
museum. The Post Office was
around the corner on Depot street,
along with the Coffee Cup (where
I ate my meals after the war) and
the local Jail. The Post Office was

‘housed in a building, since torn

down, that used to be ahotel. Inter-
estingly anew inn is being built on
the same site. What goes around,
comes around.

The oldest building down-
town, I think, is the Carolina Inn,
which was known as the Helper
Hotel. This was built around 1830-
35. My great grandfather, Hanson
Pickney Helper, acquired it in the
early 1840’s and ran it as an inn

town] was a movie
theater located where the
BP gas station is now.”

and store. The store portion was
on the north side of the building.
Pickney was also the Postmaster
and maintained the inn until late in
the century. For a while it was
used to house the “‘young ladies”
that came for various college func-
tions. In the 1950’s, the College
purchased the building and restored
the outside to it’s original appear-
ance. Pickney was one of three
brothers: Hanson, Hogan and
Hinton Helper who were born and
brought up in Mocksville, NC, just
south of Winston-Salem ina house,
still standing, that had been owned
by Squire Boone, Daniel Boone’s
father. Pickney, as many of the
former residents of Davidson is
buried in the College Cemetery on
North Main Street.

As I recall, not much has
changed on North Main Street or
Concord Road out beyond Grey
Road other than some restorations.
The College-owned houses used

to be identified by the lack of up-
keep, but since Bob Collins has
been here, that has completely
turned around to the pleasure of
the town residents. Additionally,
there used to be a funeral home on
South Main that has been con-
verted into a private residence.
Now when one dies, one must goat
least to Huntersville.

In years past, many of the
homes around the campus were
boarding houses for fraternities and
independents. My grandmother
boarded the Beta fraternity from
1898 until the early 1920’s in my.
currem home. In fact, our house
was built with an oversized dining
room having an outside door.
Hooks where the boys hung their
coats are still on the wall outside
the door. A strong bond existed
between many of the women who
ran the boarding houses and “‘my
boys.” This set-up provided jobs
for single women, widows, and
those who needed to supplement
their family income. It was one of
few jobs that was available to them
at that time.

The town of Davidson has
changed over the years, some for
the better and some in the other
direction, depending upon your
taste. However, there have not
been drastic renewal projects as
experienced in other towns suchas
Charlotte. Fortunately, many of
the original buildings have stayed.

‘ Only the occupants have changed.

Let us hope this continues.

William D. Vinson graduated
from Davidson in 1948 and has
lived in town most of his life.

Short Story...

The Notice -

By Mike Cruise

Stare. :

The porch was so piled with stuff that
from the car I couldn’t see the house num-
ber, or even if there was one; little concrete
elves and mermaids and men in riding
pants—all scattered about this dingy porch,
among shaggy potted trees and plaster Vir-
gins—a little fantasy jungle.

The sun was glaring hard on the crum-
bly sidewalk stinging my white cheeks.
Voices droned in the summer background,
between the small houses, grumbling
through the little neighborhood. The sedan
door boomed closed behind me and I spit
out the piece of juicyfruit that had sponged
up all my saliva.

A faded plastic bamboo blind, hanging
on the far left of the porch, blocking off the
sun, made the porch look like a cave, dark,
three steps up from the sidewalk. I crept up
the steps.

“Who dat?” a little voice barked from
somewhere on the porch. She must have
seen me jump because she laughed a little
too, but stopped quickly; probably because
she saw I was white. I don’t know. I
couldn’t see her yet.

“T said who der and what you want?”

Now I could see her, sitting over ina
chair by a concrete lion that looked to be
some sort of table, under a brown hanging
fern. She was real dark and the shadows
hung over sol couldn’tsee her eyes, but she
was drinking out of a dark bottle and had
her dress pulled up almost to her crotch for
the heat. Something was on her lap too, but
I couldn’t make it out and didn’t want to

“Now you gonna speak, boy? What
you doin’ up here, snoopin’ around or
somethin’?” The sight of a white boy, no
older than her youngest grandchild, stand-
ing onher porch with a white envelopein his
hand, was not a happy one for her.

I told her who I was and that I had this
envelope for a Mister Terrence Shore, who
I presumed lived in this very house. My
eyes were adjusting somewhat to the shade
now so I could see her better. Her kinky
hair shot up wild and her eyes were very
round and made her look a bit crazy, like
she was holding her breath even when she
was speaking. The plastic blind didn’tkeep
the heat off the porch with the light.

“1’m looking for a Mister Terrence
Shore,” I said. “Is he around?”

“He busy wherever he is and sure don’t
have time to be fussin’ with strangers. Did
he win the lottery?” she asked with another
slurping giggle.

I said I wished he had, but as far as I
knew, he hadn’t and that was not why I was
here. A cat slid down from between her
wide thighs and startled me when it moved.
Ithustled over to where! was, rubbed around

_my ankles and sniffed up my cuff, before

lazing herself down onto an old door mat set
aside, it seemed, for just that purpose. She
stretched and rolled all the way over so she
came back up staring right at me. One time,
years earlier, my brotherand I found a dead
stray under our hedge and bummed it in gaso-
line from the lawn mower can. It curled up,
blackened like a burnt macaroni. I thought

it might be hot enough on the porch to burn
this cat but she didn’t seem bothered. She
was a good-looking house cat, round and
slow and comfortable laying out in the patch
of sun she had found.

The woman had been talking on, not
taking any notice of the cat, and not doing
anything to help my cause, only sucking up
the last bits of stale porch air. Every rotten
breath she uttered forced itself up my nose,
making mesick, and blind, and deaf. The cat
had begun to burn in the sun, I thought. First
the hair, singed away, and now the flesh,
crackling, popping, smoking black through-
outthe porch. The woman talked on; breath-
ing in the rotten smoke and blowing it out.
Mr. Shore was not at home. :

“T told you boy, he ain’t here. . .” she
wamed.

I tried to explain that I was then leaving.

theenvelope with her, butmy swollen tongue

wouldn’t bend. The envelope would tell
them to clear off the porch and get out. The
house was no longer theirs. She already
knew that. I dropped the envelope onto her
lap and slid down the three steps, off the
porch. The dry summer air, dusty and
smelling of asphalt, flushed out the porch’s
queasy haze, as I squinted against the sun
toward the sedan. The cat flashed through
my legs and into the shadows beneath the
car. The grumble of the neighborhood
filed back into my ears. Little laughs and
bitches poking in and out. It was hotter
than hell, These people were burning up.
A whole neighborhood of black people
burning up in the summer sun.

The shade in the car passed over me
like a breeze, cooling my pink face. The tip
of my nose was red and tender, and espe-
