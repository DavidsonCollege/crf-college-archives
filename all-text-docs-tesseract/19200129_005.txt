THE DAVIDSONIAN, January 29, 1920.

PEANUT PARCHER

T. H. SPENCE, Editor

Owing to a mistake the name of
Mr. I. i. Sutton was omitted from
the list of additional reporters last
week. He should have been credited
with the article on the new presi-

‘dent of the Athletic Association.

Why do they call it ‘o lea?

‘Tis ‘cause it is so strong.

F. P. ‘Hall (in Charlotte hotel)
“Say waiter, bring me that soup in
a hurry.”

Colored Gent: 1 couldn't: bring
it in a hurry, mistah: [ always
brings it in a bowl.

The poets who sang of “Those
long winter nights” didn’t go to bed
at 12 and have to get up at 7:15 for
Chapel.

here is a story of a youth,

‘Tis tragic for to tell,

(This rhyme may slightly shock
you)
But he loved two girls quite well.

And he was going splendidly,
His cases going stronger,
Until he mixed two letters up,
And now he goes no longer.

Shades of the Aqua Club appear-
ed on the campus Monday afterneen.
It is rumored that several new mem-
bers were initiated but details are
absent.

The easiest way to make a boy
mad is to contradict him: the in-
fallible way to enrage a voung
lady is to agree with her.

The best satished man on the Hill
is the fellow who just read “One”
on himself in the peanut  parcher.
Of course he won't admit, but just
watchem smile when they think
they are unnoticed and they see
themselves in print.

“! cannot live without you”
He heard the maiden say

And like a fool believed it
Departing on his way.

“[ love you even more than life”
That gallant knight replied

The maiden then believed him-

Not knowing how he lied.

And _ now they’re married happily
—Not to each other though

Forgetful of their former love
For that was long ago.

Windy Aiken is a youth of rare
judgement. He announces that last
weeks peanut parcher was the best
ever. We don’t know what he
wants—yet.

I’ve been sitting quite a while, dear,
Thinking hard as thout can be,
And the thing [| have been thinking.

But, I've got to have something to

Local Nimrods. led by Ervin, L.,

if his gun had not kicked with such
great emphasis, and if he could have
found the bird.

Steam Engine Ratchford of Hell
Alley savs he can’t figure out why
they don't import a silo to supply
green freshmen for this time of
year,

Prominent Senior: “Say. fresh,
what classes do you enjoy most?”
lippant Fresh: “The ones | cut.”

It ain't we mind your coming.
Since we sorter like you, snow,
But what we hate like thunder,
Is to see you start to go.

Thanks to the possession of a map

Judge Cooper, before whom the
