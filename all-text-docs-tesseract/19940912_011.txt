To make the music, you've got to break some hearts

Country is the music of the
forlorn, the betrayed, the hurt, and
the forgotten. Country is the music
of the broken-hearted.

When we think of country
music, images come to mind of a
sad, tortured soul drinking his tears
away, alone and forgotten. It’s no
surprise that not only the suicide
rate, but that of alcoholism, ranks
higher among country listeners
than among listeners of any other
musical genre. The gap expands if
we consider only the performers.

Why does desolation plague

country music? Perhaps it began
back with Hank Williams and his
broken-hearted contemporaries.
Now it’s an endless cycle: those
raised on a music of sadness per-
petuate the trend in their own art.
Unhappiness begets unhappiness.
» Perhaps that musical unhap-
piness makes us that much more
susceptible to despair; that’s my
theory, anyway. Woe is me and all
my fellow country fans. Maybe
they really ought “to put warning
labels on those sad country songs.”
In any case, that woe is there

and will be always. Just as Hank
sang “‘There’s a tear in my beer”
decades ago, Clint Black is still
keeping “‘a tight grip on the bottle,
gettin’ loose and killin’ time.” Just
as Patsy Cline was once “Crazy”
over her lost love, Patty Loveless
is now left “Holdin on to Nothin’
but the Wheel.”

We remember not the up-beat
yet transient Lari Whites or Ricky
Lynn Greggs. We remember the
balladeers immortalized in heart-
ache. Willie Nelson, Keith
Whitley, and Alan Jackson don’t

stay with us for their toe-tapping
“Chattahoochees.” We remember
“Railroad Lady,” “I’m No Stranger
to the Rain,” and “Here in the Real
World.”

These songs reach out to us in
our moments of hopelessness, if
not to comfort, at least to empa-
thize. For the despairing don’t
want words of optimism, they want
words of understanding.

Dwight Yoakam says it best
in his 1990 song entitled—appro-
priately—“Sad, Sad Music”:

I’d swear that I woke up with

you this morning ‘

But I can see that it’s bee
days since you were here

And every night it still hits
home without a warning

As my world becomes a flood
of scalding tears.

There should be music

Sad, sad music

But this silence thatyou left is
all that I have,

And if we must choose, coun-
try music fans like myself will
always take the sad, sad music
over silence.

jumping theme throughout
Clancy’s work, one that is not of-
ten explored. Usually, we are left
to watch the breakdown of tech-
nology or the prevailing human
spirit over its computerized op-
pressors.

Overall, I wasn’t impressed
with this movie.. Throughout the
film, it felt as though we were only
seeing the bare framework of
Clancy’s story, and even then it
seemed crammed into two hours.
The acting and special effects (save
an incredibly fake rescue at the
end) were excellent; but if you go
into the theater expecting another
Patriot Games, be warned.

Adventure in

for a relative’s sins. The priest
who taught Tracy admitted to hav-
ing approximately 100 such fe-
males, most of whom serve as con-
cubines to the high chief. Tracy
said that the Ghanaian national
government is trying to put a stop
to troksi and similar practices, es-
pecially due to Christian influences
in the country.

Living with two Ghanaian
families offered. some comfort
away from home, and Tracy ad-
mitted that she never regretted be-
ing in Accra; she said without hesi-
tation that she will return to Ghana
again in the future. She did have
the opportunity to travel quite a bit
through Ghana, especially to rural
villages, but she regrets not having
had the chance to travel more ex-
tensively: through Africa, due to
political and social unrest in the
regions and countries surrounding
Ghana. She does, however, intend
to return to the African continent
and to explore the cultural diver-
sity its countries have to offer.

Tracy’s experiences in Ghana
last semester, she feels; changed her
inmany subtle, yet significant ways,
opening her eyes to the vast differ-
ences between Wester and Eastern
cultures. “The two cultures can’t be
compared,” she said, “because
there’s so much that we don’t know
about them. We can’t call one de-
veloped and one undeveloped, be-
cause the differences are so great.”

Dear Terry,

Homecoming is near, and I
am dateless. I have several op-
tions, and I am not sure which I
should choose. Perhaps youcould
shed some light.

Should I take the safe route
and aska good friend, ensuring an
OK time but no action? Alterna-
tively, I could ask someone I am
interested in but don’t know well.
This is'a risky option, and I am
afraid it might blow up in my face,
even if she says yes. (It’s hap-
pened before.)

I sure could use some advice
on this problem. Thanks.

Sincerely,

Dateless

Dear Dateless,

I know what you’ re thinking,
“Tf I never take achance, I’ll never
bag a babe.”

The problem with date func-
tion weekends is that they last so
long. If your date is a flop, you're

stuck with it for two days, unless

‘ homecoming. If you’re a good

it’s so bad that you don’t even
bother with the second half.
Here is another consider-
ation: with your alumni friends
coming back, you may want a
date who doesn’t demand your
undivided attention. Inevitably,
you will disappoint someone if
you have a high-stress date to

date, you’ll disappoint your
friends, and if you’re a true frat
boy, you’ll disappoint your date.
You will not enjoy yourself if you
have to worry constantly about
one or the other.

Taking a risk on a date is an
exciting enterprise, but there’s no
reason to risk one that’s two days
long. Ask your dream girl out to
dinner or something first, and if
all goes well, you may want to ask
her to homecoming. And if it
isn’t so hot, ask your friend. If
you’re really that concerned about
hooking up, hook with somebody
else’s date.

Love, Terry

Charcoal drawings, massive
upholstered sculptures, anda stable
full of horses. . .the Visual Arts
Center kicks off the new year with
an exhibit of Davidson art profes-
sors’ work.

As the viewer first enters the
gallery, a landscape of the human
body unfolds before the eyes. Herb
Jackson’s show “Body of Work”
contains charcoal studies of the
human body—a deviation from
what people familiar with his work
may be expecting to see. Jackson’s

. earlier works have often been non-

objective in nature and are typi-
cally paintings. Commenting on
this aspect of his show, Jackson
explained, “It’s interesting to do
something different than I usually
do. I got interested in this when we
offered figure studies in the art
department—you’ve got to keep
them guessing—but most of my
work is completely abstract.”

Charcoal, upholstery, & horses

There are-a few paintings inter-
mingled amongst the figure stud-
ies which depict the human torso
but sway toward the non-objective
and give the viewer a taste of
Jackson’s work in that medium.

As one continues through the
gallery, one might be startled to
find moving sculptures and loud
sounds not typical of an art gallery
setting. | The room is electric,
noisy, and larger than life. This is
one aspect which makes Cort
Savage’s work so interesting.
According to Savage, “Sound and
motion are elements of form in
sculpture,” One may find working
telephones, a circular saw, a jar of
buttons, and a bloated human
torso—all familiar objects to a
viewer. Savage adds that “what is
unfamiliar is the way in which they
are combined—you have to think
more metaphorical.”
