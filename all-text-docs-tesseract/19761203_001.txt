LACK OF FUNDS forces govern-
ment to shut down post office.

Postal Service cutbacks
to affect Davidson branch

Students will return from
Christmas vacation to find the
Davidson post office shut
down for an indefinite period
of time. Local officials are
reluctant to comment on the
closing, but one post office
worker was willing to talk. ‘‘It
will really hurt to no longer be
able to serve the community,
but there is nothing we can do.
The word from Washington is
to close up the first of the
year.”’

This action is similar to
other closings of small town
post offices across the nation.
All of the shut-downs are part
of a new money-saving pro-
gram to be put into effect by

College changes PE policy.

The Davidson physical edu-
cation department has pro-
posed a plan whereby students
will be charged for their P.E.
courses.

The plan, approved by Col-
lege President Dr. Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. Wednesday would
go into effect at the start of
spring term, pending the ap-
proval of the Davidson Trust-
ees of their meeting early last
week,

‘‘Although the Trustees
must approve the plan for
bureaucratic reasons, I see no
problem in the proposal pass-
ing, because the Trustees us-
ually act on my recommen-
dations,” said Spencer.

Under the proposed plan,
students will be charged a
maximum of $15 for “courses
requiring expensive equip-
ment or courses taking place
outside the immediate David-
son campus.”’ This would in-

clude such courses as ice ska-
ting, mountaineering and
bowling (plus lane fee and shoe
rental). ‘‘Courses requiring
neither college-owned equip-
ment nor instruction”’ will
require a minimum payment of
$5. This would include such
courses as jogging or bicy-
cling. All other courses would
assess students a $10 fee.

To avoid paying the fee, a
student may pass the profi-
ciency requirement offered at
the start of the term. ‘‘We
couldn’t charge for that,”’ said
one department official; “‘it
doesn’t take much work to
give one of those m-----
f------ ,e

In any event, theoretically
this plan could cost a David-
son student a minimum of $25,
and perhaps as much as $75 to
pass his P.E. requirement.

The justification for the fee
according to President Spen-
cer is that the students have

not been responsible when it
comes to the use of the gym
and the college’s equipment
and instructors. He cited as an
example, ‘‘when a strong male
student slams a volleyball into
an instructor’s head. We need
the money for possible hospi-
tal costs.”

“T really don’t care one way
or the other,”’ Spencer said, “‘T
already passed my P.E. re-
quirements. Tee hee.”’

The Davidsonian inter-
viewed some of the faculty of
the P.E. department but did
not get very far. ‘‘I’d rather
not comment on the subject,”’
replied Tom Couch, “It’s real-
ly out of my jurisdiction. You
probably ought to talk to
Emil Parker.’’ Parker com-
mented from inside his car,
‘‘Look, I’ve been gone all
week, and I really don’t know
what’s going on. Why don’t
you talk to Chip Stone. It was
his idea anyway.”’

the Postmaster General. This
reporter’s source at the David-
son post office stated, ‘‘As we
understand it, it came down to
a choice between closing small
post offices or increasing pos-
tal rates. The Postmaster
General’s office apparently de-
cided that people would rather
pay less for stamps than have
convenient service.”’

The official memo from the
Postmaster General’s office
concerning the shut-downs
states that-small town resi-
dents whose service is discon-
tinued will have to pick up
their mail at the post office in
the largest city in their coun-
ty. For Davidson residents,
this means that they will have
to go into Charlotte for their
mail. Town officials are attem-
pting to arrange to have
Davidson mail dropped off at
the Mooresville post office,
but since Mooresville is in
Iredell County, such an arran-
gement is unlikely.

College officials are hopeful
that student mail can be

picked up in bulk in Charlotte
and delivered to students at a

central location on campus.
President Spencer commen-
ted, ‘‘This shut-down is a sur-
prise, but we will try to cope
the best we can. If we are able
to transport student mail to
Davidson each day, then we
will have a daily mail call in
my front yard each morning at
7:30.

It would be very easy for
someone to abuse this ar-
rangement, so the policy will
be that each student can pick
up only his own mail. In order
to cover expenses, each stu-
dent will have to pay a slight
fee for each piece of mail he or
she receives. We will need stu-
dent volunteers to drive into
Charlotte each night to pick
up the next day’s mail. Any-
one wishing to serve the
college in this fashion should
leave their name with my
assistant Peter Clark.”

Negotiations are now under
way between Director of Hou-
sing Scotty Nicholls and town
officials concerning the use of
the vacated post office build-

Kelton appointed Academic V-P

Acting on the suggestion of
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr., the Board of
Trustees appointed Professor
of Psychology John D. Kelton
as Academic Vice President at
Davidson. Kelton will assume
the position as of January 1,
1977.

‘‘We selected Dr. Kelton
over a number of well-qualified
applicants because he’s a good
old Davidson boy and knows
the students inside out. After
all, he’s been teaching psycho-
logy here for 17 years,’ said
Spencer.

Kelton was first offered the
position in September, but
informed Spencer of his deci-
sion only Wednesday. ‘‘It’s
taken me so long to decide to
accept President Spencer’s of-
fer because I had a hard time

deciding between staying here —

x up

or going to Williams,’”’ Kelton
said.

According to Professor of
Psychology W. Gatewood
Workman, Spencer and Kel-
ton have been building a closer
relationship over the past
year.

“Last fall President Spencer
visited Kelton’s office regular-
ly every Tuesday afternoon,”
said Workman. ‘‘Then early
last spring, I think—that’s
strange, Kelton was first con-
sidered for the position last
March—I noticed the two
passing manilla envelopes
back and forth several times a
week. Yeah, last spring, a
little before John (Kelton) got
his new car.”

Kelton confirmed Work-
man’s statement, saying,
“Yes, I have been counseling
Dr. Spencer for the past year.

¥.3-5

I’m offering my services as an
alternative to Ava.”’

Kelton has planned several
revisions in the Davidson cur-
riculum, including reviving
mandatory chapel every morn-
ing at 10 am and mandatory

Kelton

ROTC every afternoon.
“Back when I was a student

here everybody, I mean every-
body, attended chapel. If you
didn’t you were campused.
Chapel is good for students in
this age of increased atheism
and disrespect for the church,
and besides, since the post
office is closing, what else will
the students do at 10 every-
day?”’ he said.

“I'm also reinstating a dress
code besides that you must
wear a shirt to class. The men
will wear coats and ties—none
of these loud things, now —
and the women must wear
dark skirts with hemlines two
inches below the knee and
white blouses.

“I wanted to order uniforms
for the students, but haven’t
decided exactly what I want
yet,’ he continued.

Students will have an enfor-
ced curfew of 10 pm weekdays
and midnight on weekends,

with a lights-out rule one hour
after that.

“T’m having hidden cameras
installed in random dormitory
rooms to insure this ruling,”’
he said. ““Not every room will
have a camera, but I will be
the only person who knows
which rooms do.”’

Kelton also plans revisions
of faculty policy, especially for
faculty meetings. A strong
believer in the value of en-
counter groups, he plans to
abolish the meetings and to
replace them with encounters
at his home. :

“Encounter groups should
not be larger than 15 members
so I’ll divide the faculty into
different groups that meet
once a month each. Then once
a term we'll have a marathon
session over a weekend, with
white rat barbeque for the
food,’’ he said.
