Davidson initiates Black
achievement scholarship

By LYMAN COLLINS
News Editor

Beginning with the Class of
1983 Davidson College will
sponsor National Achieve-
ment Scholarships: according
to Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White.

The National Achievement
Scholarship Program, admin-
istered by the National Merit
Scholarship Corporation
(NMSC), “exists specifically
to identify promising black
students and to encourage
them to pursue higher educa-
tion,’’ according to a letter
from the NMSC to College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr.

Zimmermann, Committee
explore course evaluations

By EMILY PARTIN
Staff Writer

Vice-President of Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann,
the Professional Affairs Com-
mittee (PAC), and the SGA
are working to develop new
systems of student evaluation
of faculty and courses at
Davidson.

There are two basic pur-
poses behind course evalua-
tion. One is to allow for
student input into the admini-
stration’s assessment of facul-
ty, involving, for example,
promotion of faculty members
and granting of tenure.

Zimmermann is in charge of
developing a system that
would deal with this aspect.
His goal is to elicit student
perception of faculty perfor-
mance. According to Dr. Zim-
mermann, the information ga-
thered would be used primari-
ly by College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr. and himself
and would be kept confiden-
tial.

Zimmermann is currently
studying evaluation forms be-
ing used by other colleges. He
will be working closely with
the PAC to provide for faculty

input concerning the issue.

The second purpose of eval-
uation is to provide students
with information concerning
faculty and courses to aid in
course selection. The Course
Evaluation committee of the
SGA is dealing with this
aspect.

The committee, comprised
of students Dave Tinkler,
Charlie Strange and Ralph
Yeilding, is working on a
system that will be, according
to Yeilding, ‘“‘student run and
used.”’

According to Yeilding, some
professors view wide distri-
bution of this information as
“having their grades posted
on the doors of Chambers.”’

Another criticism in the
past has been that these
evaluations have not been
representative--last year only
about 25 per cent of the forms
handed out to students were
completed and returned--and
therefore the results are nei-
ther fair nor accurate.

In response tothese criti-
cisms, the SGA committee is
attempting to regularize the
evaluation process, perhaps
by asking professors to distri-

bute the forms in their classes,
to insure that every student is
given one.

Both Zimmermann and the
SGA committee have yet to
work out all the details’ and

procedures.-They both, how-

ever, hope to have everything
worked out this winter.

White explained that the
program has three subdivi-
sions.

The first subdivision awards
students a one year nonrenew-
able grant of 1,000 dollars
These grants are financed by
businesses and industries.

The second subdivision is
funded by corporate founda-
tions, foundations and other
business organizations. These
grants are reviewable and
range in amount from 250
dollars to 1500 dollars.

The third area is funded by
colleges and universities. Col-
leges receive a number of
names of scholarship finalists
who have listed that college as
their first choice. The College
then chooses its recipients
from this pool.

The new program that Da-
vidson is now initiating fall
into the third subdivision.

White explained that Dav-
idson has always had a num-
ber of National Achievement
Scholarship recipients who
have come here with scholar-
ships from the first two subdi-
visions.

According to the letter sent
to Spencer the high number of
finalists who have chosen Da-
vidson in the past sparked the

invitation to expand the pro-
gram.

“A total of about 85 colleges
and universities continually
attract black students who
qualify as Achievement Pro-
gram finalists, and we there-
fore invite them to sponsor
Achievement Scholarships in
1978,’’ according to the letter.

White indicated that he was
‘‘pleasantly surprised’’ “to
learn that Davidson ranked in
the top 85 colleges who attract
finalists.

He explained that under the
terms of the program the
college is commitied to grant-
ing at least one such scholar-
ship each year, but the college
is not limited to that number.

There will be a minimum
stipend of 250 dollars and a
maximum of 1500 dollars, but
White indicated that that sum
could be supplemented by
regular scholarships and fi-
nancial aid.

The program will be finan-
ced through the general scho-
larship budget. He added that
it probably will not greatly al-
ter the amount of scholarship
aid presently awarded.

“We are going to use it as a
recruiting tool to encourage
more able black students to

chose Davidson,”’ he said.
