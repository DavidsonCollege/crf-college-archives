FRIDAY, OCTOB! OCTOBER 27, 1950

Whittlemen After Second Victory

In Final Home Appearance of Fall

a Coach Heath Whittle’s

abbreviated cross-country team

bucks an out-of-eonference foe tomorrow morning when it runs
into the Bulldog Harriers from the University of Georgia.

The Georgians go against the
Cats without any word on their
past record or potential perfor.
mance known in this area. Whit-
tle’s runners will stick to their six
man team, two short of a full cross
country crew.

Tom and Dick Stockton are the
two the Cats are looking to to set
the pace with Bob Henry, Bill Lec,
Dan McKeithan, and Dick Patter-
son supplying the depth.

After losses to State, Duke, and
North Carolina, the Wildcat run-
ners bounced into the win column
last Saturday by swamping Wash-
ington and Lee before a Homecom-
ing crowd. Placing five runners in
first place and one in second, the
Wildcats completely shut out the
Generals with a 15-44 victory. The
Stocktons, Henry, Lee, and Mc-
Keithan crossed the finish line to-

gether, followed by Patterson.

Tomorrow morning's meet is the
final home appearance of the har-
tiers this season. From here out
they hit Virginia and William and
Mary in a triangular affair at Char-
lottesville Va. and go to Raleigh
for the Southern Conference and
state meets.

Under a handicap all season with
the loss of their captain and No. 1
man’ Blake Bradley, the Whittle-
men have nevertheless performed
surprisingly well and are gaining
in strength with the season's pro.
gression. That fact plus the home
course advantage should rate. them
the favorites’ nod. over the Geor-
gians in the morning.

SPIRITED FROSH TRAVEL TO FURMAN

Freshmen Tennis Material Smooth in Fall Work;
Should Be Future Aid To DC’s Athletic Pride

By MOODY SMITH

Davidson’s Freshman _ tennis
team for 1951 has been working out
this fall right along with the varsity
boys and according to Coach Der-
tick Barton, prospects for the
spring season are fairly good.

Up until the present time only
five players have been selected for
the frosh aggregation. Since this

§doesn’t constitute a complete team

one or more additional players will
probably join the squad when
spring practice commences. -

The racket-wielders who have al
ready made the team are led by

John Bremer of Wilmington, N. C.,
an able netsman who for the past
couple of years has been runner-up

in the North Carolina high school
singles tournament.

Also included on the squad is
Corky Johnson, a member of Char-
lotte Central High's 1950 cham-
pionship team. The remaining play-
ers are Buford Price of Lexington,
Kentucky. Scott Downs of Ridge-
wood, New Jersey, and Harold
Johnson of Atlanta, Georgia.

Downs is experienced for his
age, having played in the No. 1
slot for Ridgewood High School in
his home town. McDonald, although
he has never played high school
or prep school tennis, has had con-
siderable tournament eferience:
while Price, who is probably the
least experienced of the group has

been showing up surprisingly well,
upon occasion pinning back the ears
of his more seasoned colleagues.

A once-beaten but still spirited freshman team will leave
for Greenville, S. C., tomorrow morning to play the frosh Pur-
ple Hurrieane of Furman in their second game of the season.
At kickoff time the Wildkittens of Coach Boyd Baird will be
underdogs by approximately 21 points.

Their first toss to the Citadel
frosh two weeks ago showed up
some flaws which have since been
worked on a great deal in recent
scrimmages, and the defense contin-
tres to look good, but judging by
comparative scores, the Kittens

j wilt have an uphill fight of it to

beat the Purple Hurricane. Fur-
man beat the Citadel freshman
team 31-6 last Saturday, and were
penalized 212 yards in the process.

The most important change in
the lineup has been the shifting of
fleet Johnny Gray to quarterback.
Since the Citadel) game, Coach
Boyd Baird has worked the States-
ville boy in that spot several times
in scrimmages and he will probably
see quite a bit of service tomorrow,

alternating with Hershel Allen, Tim
Gilley, and Sid Cutts. Allen, hurt in
the Citadel contest, will be back to
start tomorrow.

Coach Baird has had words of
high praise for his line, which did
an excellent job in the season's
opener. He has particularly lauded
the play of Tackles Neale Gra.
ham and Bob Loy, standouts on
defense throughout the contest.

The frosh coach has put his squad
through strenuous workouts every
day climaxing almost every prac-
tice with a scrimmage with the var-
sity. Both the freshman and varsity
squads have run several hundred

yards of wind sprints during al.
