Chairman Ball Previews
Coming Film Attractions

“Although the motion picture medium more than any other calls for the imaginative

mind, more than any other,

Next semester, as has been
the case for the present one,
movies will be shown at David-
son to accomplish two purpos-
es, announced Film Chairman
Gordon Ball. The first is to
present the imagination in the
films as yehicles for thought;
the second is to use the pro-
eeeds of the films to acquire
new and better movie equip-
ment.

Several film programs will
appear between now and the
end of the second semester.
God's Little Acre, which com-
pletes the tongue-in cheek’ re-
ligious series, will be shown
tomorrow night.

Next week's schedule will
feature The Maltese Faicon on
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday nights in the
Morrison Room. Heralded by
Paul Rotha in The Film Till
Now as “an outstanding ex-
ample of brilliantly used camera
devices of all kinds,’ it stars
Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor,
and Peter Lorre; it is directed
by John Huston, of Treasure of
fhe Slerra Madre and Night of
the Iguana fame. Reports Bran-
don Films:

“James Agee called The
Maltese Fatcon ‘the best private-
eye melodrama ever made.’ It
had the additional distinction of
introducing the directiorial
skills of John Huston, who pre-
viously had been only a screen-
writer. It made his reputation
almost overnight.

“The story contains most of
the dramatic ingredients which
characterized the ‘private-eye’
mystery films of the period. A
highly-valued exotic subject (a

Spade (Humphrey Bogart)

charming, double-crossing client
(Mary Astor), a mysterious
foreigner (Peter Lorre), a sin-
ister fat man (Sydney Green-
street). and his grim but hap-
less gun boy (Elisha Sook, Jr.).

Time magazine reviewed:

“A passel of furtive folk vig-

get hold of a bejeweled statuette
of a falcon may sound old-hat
to present day cinema-goers.
but director John Huston makes
their melodramatic activities as
immediate as a shot in a dark
room.

“His characters keep close to
Hammett’s originals, who in
turn are so close to real life
that what is constantly about to
happen to them (and often does)
becomes at times downright un-
bearable.

“This dramatic suspense is
heightened by some practically
perfect performances by a slick
cast... Humphrey Bogart gives
the performance of his career.

“Close behind him is an aging
(61), solid (280 Ib.) crackerjack
Broadway star (Sidney Green-
street) making his first movie a
shivery success. Making a trio
wih his part is slight, saccha-
rine, sinister Peter Lorre, whose
mere presence would turn a
bedtime story macabre.”

As usual. free flicks, will be
shown during exams week. On

tap are The Magnificent Seven
(Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, and
Steve McQueen), Hound of the
Baskervilles, Love is a Ball, and
three cartoons.

During Midwinters a special
alternative will be offered to
after-parties on the night of Fri-
day. Feb. 13. Beginning at 11:30,
three movies will be shown:
Night of the Iguana, The Apart-
ment, and Experiment in Terror.
Admission is free. and the Union
lounge chairs will be moved into
the Morrison Room to make it
as comfortable as possible for
students and their dates.

Next semester Film Friends

will expand its program to six!

films while maintaining the
present membership fee of $2.00.

Under the theme of “Great
Directors.” films by each of the
following cinematic creators will

Griffith, the Soviet Union's Ser-
gei Eisenstein, France’s Jean
Vigo and Rene Clair. Japan’s

will investigate the contributions
of the director. ,

In the spring two other special
attractions are planned: a Cul-
tist Film Festival, and a Film

The former will run for two
weeks and will attempt to satis-
fy four types of film enthusiists
by the following motley pro-

Russell Controls Music Department

By BOB STRAUSER

The term “Davidson in-
stitution” brings to mind
visions perhaps of the old
well, the foul odor of the
smoking rooms in Chambers
Buildings, or indolent un-
der - achievers sleeping

Herb Russell, ‘‘administrative
assistant” in the music depart-

ment, presents an earthier
somewhat vitriolic. picture of
what an institution can be —
even at Davidson.

‘*Too damn long,” said Russell
as I started to ask how long
he had beén associated with
the school. ‘I came here as a
-student in 1948 and never left; in
1951 I got my BS — and that

ternities would be a step in the
right direction.

This, I feel. could: best be ac-
complished by instituting Sopho-
more Rush. Given one full year
for a reasonable adjustment to
college life. the student would
have a better perspective on the
place of fraternity life in his
oWn pursuit of a liberal educa-
tion. Granted, Sophomore Rush
would place a heavy burden‘on
the College—that of providing
providing a social outlet for
freshmen: the social realm is
clearly on the functions of the
college community. And this is
a responsibility Davidson Col-
lege should have accepted long
ago.

Davidson must do no less than
help provide a social framework
that will advance its total edu-

cational goals in the most effec-
tive way. The fraternities obvi-
ously can play a-role here, but

as it exists the system must be cently; “It did me a great dea} age):”

upon the attainment of this end.
And thus far, I feel that the fra-
ternity system has detracted

(2.) Somewhere, somehow, we

at Davidson have come to ac-
cept, condone, and defend a
social. system that permits a
Davidson student to become a
victim to a system of formal re-
jection and excluston from a
major portion of student life.
We have bragged about our
“model” fraternity system bas-
ed on the blackball, a system
which, in affect, formally seg-
regates one group from anoth-

One man who experienced
this exelusion said to me re

seribe it for anyone else.’ And
this boy later got a bid!

What about the boys who did-
n't? Why cannot all segments
of the Davidson community
jointly resolve that every boy
who wants a fraternity bid will
get one? Why cannot we in-
stitute 100 per cent bidding?

As Gary Martin said, “What
I am talking about is freedom
of association, or our lack of
it. I'm talking about the arti-
ficial barriers, the unfair labels
in one case, the stigmas in
another, which are. created
through these superficial groups
which somchow have come to
demand almost the samc re-
spect as God, mother,-and coun-
try.’ Surely the Davidson stu-
dent is bright enough to realize
that there are others who have
something to offer besides those
who suavely got by the black-
ball.

It is time for basic changes.
Surely we are now ready for
them. If we are not, our frater-
nity system will continue to
eheck unnecessarily our for-
ward movement toward reach-
ing the goals of the College.
