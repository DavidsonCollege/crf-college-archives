A LOOK AT...

Davidson College’s
cross-country team, boast-
ing a perfect record with
five wins and no defeats,
will journey to Green-

Quote, Unquote .. . Zap

COACH DOLE let fly a golden quote this week, but
he had noes ae for top honors. The Wiidcat master-
mind described the Davidson offensive attack at PC as
“a backfiring Model-T Ford.”

COACH DWIGHT Shoe strolled into a Wednesday
meeting he’d called for those who wished to tryout for
the swimming team. First question: “Can any of you
boys swim?”

FINALLY, we leap back a couple of weeks to The
Citadel football game here. After the Bulldogs had won,
21-15, a sportswriter from the RALEIGH NEWS & OB-
SERVER remarked, “This is the friendliest and most
— campus I've ever set foot on.” Take a bow, Dav-
idson.

Blowing Out The Candles

IT HAPPENED Oct. 6 in Chester, S. C., at the David-
son-Citadel freshman football game. Davidson's Russell
Walls and Jim Fuller bore down on the Bullpup runner
—Don Crabtree. As they made the tackle, something
popped in Don’s back. He was taken to the hospital with
a back injury. It was his birthday.

THERE WAS a turncoat in the Davidson stands at PC
Saturday: Dr. George Staples, college chaplain, a guard
for the Blue Hose in his college days.

Signs Of Winter

THE WINTER sports mentors came knocking this|ory, Mercer, High Point, and ton and Lee will also be con-]’

week with the following announcements: Varsity swim-
ming practice begins Monday, with two weeks of “land
drills.’’ Varsity wrestlers start to work Monday, checking
out equipment on Monday and Tuesday. And fréshmen
inclined toward basketball should meet with Coach Joe
Hunt Monday at 7:30 p.m. The ’Kittens play 18 games.
Winter seasons kick-off in mid December.

IF IT’S contact work you're looking for, try the foot-
ball Wildcats. Two of the SS Cordle and Lou
Zirkle—especially. Cordle lost the contact lens from his
right eye in two successive games. Thirty-five bucks
apiece. “I managed to keep them in last week,” he said.

eanwhile, at Zirkle thought he'd lost his lens. Actu-

| ally, the lens had rolled around to the back of his eye

| and teammate Mickie Slaughter had one heck of a time
correcting Zirkle’s sight.

Score—If You Can

WEEK AFTER week the Wildcats continue to run
rampant over their Southern Conference brothers on de-

| fense. After four games Davidson holds a it lead
over —— VMI with 210.3 yards pool rd
’Cats are second in pass defense and in

| game. The
| rushing defense.
AT THE SAME time, two other varsity teams—soc-
| a oe with perfect
| records. Coach Whittle owns a 5-0 , while Coach
_ Marrette has won three matches.

WHILE DAVIDSON sits out an open date tomorrow,
| our staff will be the Richmond-Citadel
_ game. The Bulldogs, who topped the ’Cats by six points,

_ are favored over the Spiders, 20-13. Richmond is here
| for Homecoming and it looks like a toss-up.

One That Got Away

WE TOOK a second look at the conference statistics
this week to see a VMI senior Howard Dyer leading every-
body in total offense and passing offense. Dyer has 722
yards to his credit overall, has completed 38 a for
597 yards and four touchdowns. Davidson “didn’t have
room for him” four years ago. Mama!

INCIDENTALLY, Coach Dole has cooked up some
new offensive plays for the Spiders.

IMAC MADE a wise move to revise its Intramural
rules and put them down in so many words. Any com-
ments we may have on the rules themselves will come
after the revisions have been made.

Two “Sports” For President

SINCE NO one else is judging on the issues, we feel
free to make an observation off the path. Jack Kennedy
will get our vote. He tried his hand at, swimming at Har-
vard, later found it came in handy as his PT boat was
shelled in World War II and he dragged his men to safety.
Dick Nixon, by the same token, has exercised by bending
knee to lke these eight years. What has he gained from
it? A busted knee (two weeks in the hospital) he suffered
stepping from a car in Greensboro this summer.

BUT THE grand old sportsman is Ike himself. Ike,
you know, is the mah who thinks GOP means “golf e a

ville, S. C. next Friday
to meet the Purple Pala-

Furman has “the same team
it had last year,” according to
Davidson Coach Heath Whittle.
The ‘Cats copped the 1959 meet.

The Wildeats ran their rec-
ord te 50 with an impressive
victory over V.P.1., and Cataw-
ba in a triangular meet in
Blacksburg this past Wednes-
day.

‘CAT PACERS

Sterling Martin, Bill Eckbert,

tively.

Doctor Is Dubbed
Wildcat Of Week —

Our “Wildcat of the Week”
tonight is ::ot a Wildcat. He
doesn’t even growl, so far as
we know.

He doesn’t go to school here.
He went to Duke some years
back.

His name is Dr. Richard
Wrenn. He’s a doctor in Char-
lotte.

We were in a prediament
this week for a star.

We thought of several Wild-
cats:

Joe .Kelly, who scored Dav-
idson’s only goal in a soccer
match Saturday; his teammate,
Mike Laughlin, who has tallied
a total of five points in three
games.

Sterling Martin, last week's
“Wildeat of the Week," who
won his third meet of the sea-
son against The Citadel Satur-
day.

Seeking help, we called on
Coach Bill Dole for a sugges-
tion and here it was we feund |
our man.

Said Dole, “Most everyone on |
offense did a good job for us
Saturday. But for “Wildcat of
the Week,” I'd pick Dr. Wrenn
in Charlotte.

“Why? Well, Dr. Woods (team |
physician) could’t make the}
trip to Clinton. He had a baby |
to deliver that day. $0 we
jasked Dr. Wrenn to go along |
and he did.”

As it turned out, the Wild- |

cats didn't need the doctor.
Davidson stayed healthy. Only |
one man—Harold Bynum—had |

to leave the game and he was
just shaken up a bit.

“But it was important that |
he be there,” said Dole. “To |
make the trip, Dr. Wrenn had |
to leave his busy office in |
Charlotte, leaving patients to |
another physician. |

The Wildcat soccer team, which has no league af-

in the words of Dr. Scott, “very |)

tacted.

Soccer is not a Southern Con-
ference sport; in other words,
there is no soccer league within
the Southern Conference.

VMI and VPI both have soc-
cer teams, but they are organ-
ized and run by students.

As the situation stands ‘how,
Davidson meets such Atlantic
Coast Conference foes as Duke,
University of North Carolina,
and N. C. State, but the Wild-
cat boosters have no champion-
ship or title to work towards.

“A league,” says Dr. Scott,
“would give the boys something
to work for. A league would
also enable us to diversify the
schedule more.”

“It's a fine sport and the boys
are doing a fine job. We want
to help them all we can,” he
concludes.

Kappa Sigs, KA’s

The Kappa Sigs and KA's
lined up Wednesday as the only
two undefeated teams in flick-
erball. Meanwhile, the Phi
Delts, brooding over defeat
from the Sigs, handed the Betas
their first loss.

Game results of last Thurs-|-

Whittle said Leafer did an |
excellent job. “I wouldn't be
surprised to see him running
alongside Gilmour next week.
He's really pulling up.”

This victory came right en
the heels of a “fine Davidson
showing” last Saturday when

the Wildcats came out ahead of
The Citadel here at Davidson
by a margin of 22-33. Martin,

Eckbert, and Gilmour finished

in one-two-three order to pace
the Davidson team.

While the varsity was paving
its perfect record, the freshman

at 1-1 by defeating East Meck-

Said Davidson Catch Paul
Marrotte, “If we play tomorrow
like we did in the second quar-

Carson Newman is going to be
trouble for us.”

‘CATS LET UP

At the half, Davidson led the
Abbey by only one point, 2-1.
“We let up in the second quar-
ter after scoring two, geals,”
said Marrotte.

Two of the Wildcats’ scores
came on penalty kicks, from
the foot of Greg Winkler, soph-
omore penalty specialist.

“Frank Tullock at right full-
back showed the best overall
performance,” Marrotte said in
praise of the sophomore.

The Netherlands’ John Strat-
ing was lauded for his set-up
efforts.

Wildeats with one point
apiece were Joe Kelly, Dave
Irvin and Charles Sasser. Kelly
seored the only point Saturday
as Davidson edged King Col-
lege, 1-0.

Marrotte credited the Abbey
with having ‘“‘a lot of scrap and
