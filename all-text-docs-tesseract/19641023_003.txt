Flutist To Fill IFC Weekend

HERBIE MANN

Fall Func

tion Flutist

Flutist Herbie Mann will
present a jazz concert, spon-
sored by the Interfraternity
Council, at Fall Function
Weekend, Nov. 14, in Cham-
bers Auditorium at 8 p. m.

This, the second IFC presen
tation of the year, ‘is. another
phase in the IFC's attempt to
satisfy every student taste at
least once during the year. IFC
president Rick von Unwerth ex
pressed hope that ‘‘Herbie Mann
will receive the kind of acclaim

here that he has received
throughout the nation. We
are indeed fortunate to have

an artist of his calibre on cam
pus.”

Mann has had three albums
on the best-selling lists the past
including his first “Village

ilbum which skyrocket

nto the big-time LP sell

year,
Gate”
ec him
er ranks

In the p x month

rpreters of Latin and-4
rhythms Mann was i

pring to participate in

ternational conference on Latin
American Affairs held at Lake
Forest College in Chicago.

Mann's research into the
ethnic music of Africa and
South America has taken him

to both continents. In 1960, he
was chosen by the State Depart-
ment to tour Africa as part of
our International Cultural Ex
change Program.

Besides giving concerts, Mann
also listened to as much na
tive music as he could, On his
return, he recorded two albums,
which express what he heard.

Mann first visited Brazil dur

ing a 1961 South American con
cert tour where he met the
young Brazilian composers and |
musicians who were writing and
playing the bossa nova.

Believing that the folk rythms
of other countries can contri-
bute to the scope of jazz, the
bossa nova has become part of
the flutist’s wide repertoire.

“At present,”’ Mann reports,
“we're incorporating Israéli,
Eastern European, gypsy and
Turkish music into our presen
tations. Why not tap all the folk
resources in order to strengthen
our jazz?"’

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL

Miller Discusses U. S. Policy

By BOB STRAUSER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Unfortunately some
people, when they think
about foreign policy, prefer
to think about it in terms of
the past rather than in
terms of current actualities
and future possibilities.”

With these words. Col. Francis

Miller, State Department As
sistant in the Bureau: of Educa
tional and Cultural Affairs, set
the tone of his Monday assemb
ly address. After apologizing
for having to speak from a pr

pared text, Col. Miller continu
ed his view of “The Aims and
Goals. of American . Foreign
Policy” for the Great Issues

Series.

To begin with, he noted: three
over-riding “‘current  actuali
ties”: dynamic change within
the world ‘political structure;
the emergence of Russia and
the U. S. to “‘bestride the world
like Colossi’’; and the domina
tion of these two nations over

the rest of the world.

Although his text included
some remarks on the neutral na
tions in this power structure,
the campus visitor chose to omit
them. Included in these re

marks was the admission, “We
not only understand but respect
the desire of a developing na
tion to avoid policies which
necessitate the diversion of its

limited resources to arma-
ments."
Miller moved on to China,

“standing off-stage in the shad-

After Vespers

ows.”’ He dismissed any. im-
mediate threat to the West.”’....
In any event, her (China's) pre-
occupation at the moment seems
to be primarily with seizing con-
trol: of the world Communist
movement. from Russia.”’

A statement of our aims and
goals, quoted from a Dean Rusk
address, culminated
‘liche-sounding summary of the
“We are. working

a world of equal

rights and equal opportunities

f human race.”

or. the whole

working achieve this world?
Said Miller, maintain
ing the might to deter agression;
we are continuing to search for
agreement with the Communists
wherever possible; we will pro
mote trends in the Communist
world toward independence and
individual freedom.

Finally,
continue to suggest cooperative
enterprises to further the com-

how the

(such as the desalinization of

But, according to the State

Department official, this is not

enough. ‘‘It is the policy of the ™

United States to contribute in
every possible way to streng-
thening the community of free
nations.” He pointed in_ parti-
cular to’ NATO. and to a “re
cognition of the interdepend-
ence of the nations bordering
on the North Atlantic.”

At the group's initial meeting

need for quality over quantity.
He also said the Special Forces

ards this year will be higher
than in the past.

He then outlined prospective
plans for the year. Meetings will

which time a class or patrol will
be held. In addition, one field
problem a semester will be

Somewhere in Davidson, late at night, a man stands in a’ small, cramped room,

bent over a crude wooden printing press. He works intently, pausin
the words, “‘Nashita,” over and over again. Finally he stops, leans

only to repeat

pipe in hand, and contentedly inspects the results of his efforts.

Hunter

Dr. John Hunter, now Presi
dent of Louisiana State Univer
sity, reportedly once released
| the college wildcat from
| cage while an undergraduate at
Davidson, In Tuesday's assemb
ly, Hunter did not allude to this
| experience (for which he was
reportedly campused) but spoke
instead on the ‘Responsibility
of the Educated Individual.”

“There is nothing in the ex
periencé of man quite like a
homecoming . . . and today that
pleasure is mine," said Hunter.
He went on to relate a family
anecdote concerning his inau-
guration as President of LSU
five years ago.

After thus ‘warming up" his
audience, the Davidson gradu-
ate (class of '34) proceeded to

made himself out of plywood, ,
hinges, and screws. It is about
three feet high, five and one
half feet long, and crude enough
to make Gutenburg seem like
a master technician. It is,
however, completely the = pro-
duct of Hogan's inspiration,
labor, and time. Described as
a “homemade flatbed press,”
t is capable of printing about
30 sheets an hour.

To make any illustrations

needed for his creations Hogan
himself must carve pictures out

cess requires not only at least
some artistic skill, but also

a great deal of patience. “If
you have no patience,” accord-
ing to Hogan, “you can't do
something like this; if you have
a little, you'll end up with a
lot.”

What started a mere in

who describes himself as hav-
ing “printer's ink” in his veins,
turned into a full time

The speaker made it clear that
his words were directed to the
individual or they would be
without meaning. ‘“‘The maxi

On higher education Hunter

sounded the familiar refrain,
“The purpose of your college
life is to teach you to teach

He noted that _leader-

young men and put forward the
idea that education is respon-
sible for youthful leadership.

educated as having a dull axe
