Interest In Failing Grades Expressed

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

As next Tuesday's
Educational Policy Committee
meeting , interest in
modifying the effect of failing
grades earned in dropped cour-
ses has grown.

Currently the _ college’s
Academic Regulations, which
are reviewed annually by the
faculty, state that when a
student drops a course after the
drop-add period has elapsed, a
grade of ‘‘F”’ is recorded per-
manently on his academic
record.

The Davidsonian

Vol. LXII, No. Twenty-Six

Even if he subsequently
passes the course, the original
“F’”’ still remains as part of his
record and is entered into his
grade-point average. This
policy has been the object of
numerous inquiries at the
Registrar’s Office, according to
Registrar Richard C. Burts Jr.

“I really think that many of
our students and faculty mem-
bers have not taken the time to
read the Academic Regulations
closely. Perhaps this rule
should be changed.

“‘As far as the Registrar's of-
fice is concerned, this rule is not

founded on any great principle.
We just carry it out since it is
part of the academic
regulations which are binding
on this office,” Burts said.

Burts indicated that there
was some feeling on the part of
the faculty that an academic
record should be as com-
prehensive as_ possible,
revealing not just a list of suc-
cessfully completed courses,

but a student's continuing ©

academic activity throughout
his college career.

One possible alternative to
this problem was investigated

by Professor of Psychology Jay
H. Ostwalt.

Ostwalt looked into 3 rer
students coul
oe up the fifth
week of the term without
penalty. Courses would have to
be added within the first five
days of the term, however.

“This is a difficult question,”’
Oswalt said. “What is a per-
son’s academic record? Should
we go to a system where cour-
ses could be taken repeatedly
until everyone in the school
makes Phi Beta Kappa?

SLC Writes New Lease For Court Houses,
Random House Must Find Non-Nationals

By BRUCE MALOY
Managing Editor

What may be the final round
in the three-year-old Patterson
Court revampment came to the
surface this week.

The Student Life Committee
(SLC) annually renews the
leases of the houses on Pat-
terson Court. The lease which is
presently being drawn up in-
cludes provisions that national
fraternities which occupy Pat-
terson Court houses must have
20 percent of their membership
who are non-members of the
national fraternity and the
president or treasurer of the
house must be non-members of
the fraternity.

This ruling applies to only two
groups on campus, Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta,
since they are presently the
only two fraternities which do
not use the self-selection
system

Dean of Students and chair-
man of the SLC Will Terry ex-
plained that as far as PGD is
a matter of getting some re-
cords together since they are
now eating at Fanny and Ma-
bel's.

Random House however,
must recruit 20 percent non-
nationals between now and the
August first deadline.

Terry explained, ‘‘The SLC
feels that I made a mistake in
allowing the situation to be
worked out the way that it
presently is. They feel that Ran-
dom House must make a
greater contribution other than
providing an eating facility for
an off-campus fraternity ."’

The general feeling of the SLC
seems to be that Random House
is a fraternity disguised as an
eating club and that as such it is
in violation of the trustee's
decision.

“The SPE's have been
allowed to use Random House,”’
said Terry, ‘‘under the assump-
tion that SPE and Random
House are not synonomous. The
SLC action will make sure that
this assumption is a fact."’

Random House President and
SPE member John Branigin
said, ‘‘As far as we are con-
cerned, we are just a group of
students like any other eating
club on the court.”

He stated, ‘“‘We would be
more than glad to have people
who are not members of SPE to
come to Random House. If

people self-select there we will
make every effort to make
them feel welcome. However, I
don’t think we should be forced
to go around knocking down
doors to find people to meet an

arbitrary ruling.
‘‘Random House,” admitted
Branigin, “is in a_ strange

position. We really didn’t rush
very much as Random House.”’

SLC member Hansford Epes
commented, ‘‘While this is
basicly a reaction to the Ran-
dom House situation, this is also
a look at the whole Patterson
Court system to clarify some
confusion resulting from the
Committee of Eighteen report.”

Epes stated that the impetus
for this action came from
students rather than from the
faculty or administration.

“We must.” he continued,
“help the Patterson Court Coun-
cil make the court as aciive a
social outlet as it can possibly
be.” :

Student member of the SLC
Bob Cunningham said. ‘The
other houses on Patterson Court
are restricted by following the
college's guidelines and those of
the Patterson Court Council.
SPE is in fact on the court and is
not subject to these restrictions.

“They have been asked to
cooperate and haven't-done so.
They held an early rush which
was unfair to the other houses
which did abide by the rules.”
he said.

“The SPE’s say that they are
unable to follow these
guidelines, but the Phi Gams
are doing it very consistently,"
said Cunningham.

Asked how Random House
will react to the stipulations of
the new leases, Branigin said,

‘We are taking out an ad in this
week's DAVIDSONIAN to get
more people to eat at Random
House and we will ask for an op-
portunity to bring this back up
before the SLC.

“‘We understood the concern
about SPE rushing early and we
agreed to send out bids on the
day of self-selection. We
thought this was all
straightened out,’ he con-
tinued. .

“I feel that this deadline is
totally unfair. As far as I am
concerned, August first is the
same as the end of this school
year. If we don’t have the 11 or
2 people we need by then, we
won't be able to get them during

SPE’'S AT RANDOM HOUSE
SLC's decision forces new recruiting.

“Should we allow no dropping
of courses under any cir-
cumstances, even physical
illness?

“I think that the right answer
lies somewhere between these
two extremes. A few years ago
some colleges had a policy of
‘forgiving’ D’s and F’s, and now
they are abandoning this
system,’’ he said.

“We are already admitting
that physical illness is a valid
reason for not completing a
course, regardless of whether
the course is in its first week or
its last days,’’ Ostwalt said.

“Possibly there are other
reasons equally valid for
allowing students to drop cour-
ses through the fifth week of
classes.

“I think that in any case a
person’s academic record
should give the truest account
possible of his academic ac-
tivity. If extenuating cir-
cumstances are causing distor-
tion, we ought to be concerned,”
Ostwalt said.

Ostwalt stated that when he
writes letters of recom-
mendation for students to
graduate schools he points out
any exceptional circumstances
that might merit special at-
tention.

Miles Ward, a student mem-
ber of the EPC (the body which |
would make recommendations
for changes in the grading
system explained the situation.

If enough students express
their dissatisfaction with the
present policy, then maybe the
EPC will recommend a change.

‘Historically, the problem
runs something like this. Two
years ago, the EPC recom-
mended an eight week drop
period. The faculty voted this
down. with instructions that the

EPC stop day dreaming,”’ said
Ward.

“The most recent motion is
for six days drop, six and one
half days add. This was
unanimously passed at our last
meeting.

“There are members who
feel, as 1 do, that an eight or ten
week drop period would be ac-
ceptable.”

Governance Committee Meets
To Discuss Policy Revisions

By ALEC HOON
Editor-In-Chief

The Davidson Governance
Committee met for the 14th
time on April 11 to continue
their discussion on a model for a
new governance system at
Davidson.

The aim of the committee is
to establish a new system

whereby all members of the.

college community will have a
more meaningful role in the
decision-making process af-
fecting the entire community.

Presently the Governance
Committee, chaired by Trustee
Walter L. Lingle Jr., is con-
sidering two possible models,
one drafted by Trustee J.
Dickson Phillips which provides
for a unicameral assembly
composed of all faculty mem-
bers, a number of students and
a number of administrators,
and one by Religion Professor
Alexander McKelway which
calls for the establishment of a

bicameral. conference system,
maintaining a student forum
and a separate faculty forum.

At the last meeting the com-
mittee gave its assent to the
following tentative agree-
ments:

(1) attendance at meetings of
the trustees by a representative
of the faculty (the chairman pro
tem if one is decided upon) and
a student representative
(presumably the president of
the SGA);

(2) attendance at meetings of
the faculty by a _ student
representative (presumably the
president of the SGA) ;

(3) attendance at meetings of
the student Senate by a faculty
representative.

Two controversial areas have
yet to be resolved.

One is whether the student
representatives should be
allowed to have a vote in
whatever governing body the
committee proposes, or
whether they should attend

merely in an advisory capacity.

A secona area of concern 1n-
volves the relationship between
the campus governing structure
and the Board of Trustees.

When the areas’ of
disagreement have been set-
tled, the committee will present
a recommendation of its own to
the Board of Trustees for ap-
proval.
