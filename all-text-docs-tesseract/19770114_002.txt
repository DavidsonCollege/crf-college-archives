President Young moves in

By TRACY UPCHURCH
Staff Writer

With a new year, a new,
editor, and a new SGA presi-
dent, it happens that we will
now have a new. SGA column.

I had the problem to talk
with Thom Young, the new
SGA president, on the eve of
his first meeting with the
Senate. I had a lot of trouble
finding something that he was
discouraged about, though
‘there is a sense of apprehen-
sion about the fate of Exten-
ded Studies.

Thom is cooperating with
existing Senate committees
and is generally trying to
funnel people with ideas and
energy in the right direction.

The period between his elec-
tion and the first meeting of
the Senate has been one of
cooperation. Thom feels like

he has been well received by
Sam Spencer and Will Terry,
...heaven knows that is impor-
tant.

Bo Baskin has been very
helpful in giving him ideas
and answering his questions,
and Roger Brown has given
him three pages of ideas.
Everyone is very hopeful that
he will continue his work on
student-faculty relations. Ro-
ger has also been recently
appointed to fill the vacancy
on the important Educational
Policy Committee that has a
lot to say about Extended
Studies.

Work is being done revamp-
ing the Arts and Crafts area of
the Union. The Inter-Organiz-
«tional. Forum is meeting acti-
vely again and Thom hopes it
will be a ‘‘clearinghouse of
ideas’’ between the heads of

NC PIRG to host national conference

NC PIRG will be host to all
the PIRG’s and Citizen Action
Groups (CAG’s) in the world
when we hold the Southern
Regional Conference/National
PIRG Clearinghouse meetings
March 4-6 at Duke University.
These gatherings are designed
to bring together students and
professionals to share current
views on the movement and its
pressing issues.

One day will be devoted to
the public interest concept in
general with a presentation on
what it is all about, why it
came to be and what one can
do as a public citizen.

The rest of time will be

spent in issue-oriented work-
shops: Consumerism and
Health, Landlord-tenant Rela-
tions, Occupational Safety
and Health, Returnables, Uti-
lity Reform and Nuclear Pow-
bal Contact

To begin the new year,
PIRG has developed two new
projects. The first is a survey
of housing in the Davidson
area. We plan to compile an
off-campus housing directory
giving location, rent and cond-
ition of the housing units.

Interviews (mostly by tele-
phone) need to be conducted
with all the off-campus stu-
dents as well as their land-
lords.

If you would like to offer
information or help interview,
call on Kathy McLendon
(-3060, Belk 468).

The second project involves
the practice of cash discount-
ing. The merchants participa-
ting agree in advance to give a
discount to any individual
using cash instead of credit
cards since the merchant must
pay the card companies a
certain amount of money for
the use of their cards.

We have in mind a pilot
program where we convince
local groups and then mer-
chants of the desirability of
such a plan. See Sabra Faires
(Belk 468, -3060) if you want
to assist.

Prison Reform

T. J. Reddy was in David-

| son’s 900 Room just before the
_Christmas break.'To-a respon-

sive crowd he read some of his
poetry and related his exper-
iences in life and prison.

Reddy’s visit was the first
in a series of college-wide
events concerning prisons and
their reform.

Upcoming is an all-day visit
by Jessica Mitford, author of’
Kind and Usual Punishment:
The Prison Business, on
March 24 as well as a Prison
Career Day in April where job
opportunities in the prison and
criminal justice areas are dis-
cussed. We invite all to attend
and participate.

NC PIRG Expands

Students at Davidson are
among 10,000 students in
North Carolina who contribute
more than $30,000 to NC
PIRG. Other chapters are at
Duke University, Elon Col-
lege, St. Andrews College and
Wake Forest University. Next
year UNCC and N.C. State
will join PIRG, enabling us to
work for consumer and envi-
ronmental protection and ag-
ainst injustice more strongly
than we have in the past.

A “Trustee Day” is in the
works for February 14. The
idea is that several area trus-
tees will come to campus and
spend their time visiting with
students, going to classes, in
the Union, and even spend the
night on the halls. The last
part should be interesting...

Sentelle Dorm Senator
Hans Watford is heading up a
committee on the security
question. He is curious ‘about
the absence of the red phones
on the girls’ floors, the lack of
light at Carnegie, and why the
police are always in their cars
instead of on foot.

There is an idea going
around to start a ‘‘bad check’’
committee that would handle
the problem of Davidson stu-
dents passing bad checks,
instead of ‘the police. The
Dean’s office has received
three reports of this practice
since Christmas. They have
the committee at U. Va. and it
seems like a,good thing for us,
too.

Carnegie-Little Senator Da-
na English, w eads the
group on cura luation
thinks that’ her group’s work
will be ready for the printer in
about two weeks. The booklet
will be available for fall course
selection. There is a proposal
that the Senate elect a student
to be full-time editor of the
booklet starting next fall.

Sophomore Joanne Hull re-
ceived nothing but praise for
the fine work she did in
running the recent elections.
They appear to have been the
smoothest in recent memory
and a far cry better than the
fall election.

SGA vice president Bruce
Brown is doing some work on
improving the quality of the
Senate visitation. He is also in
charge of the Residential Hall
Council while Thom. is inter-
viewing candidates for aca-
demic vice-president.

The first Senate meeting
opened with the swearing in of
the six new members. The
body of the meeting was an
open-ended discussion of pos-
sible new areas of actions.
Several ideas were: looking
closely at ARA Services (since
their contract is up for renewal
in the spring), revival of the
Davidson National Print and
Drawing Contest, and reeval-
uation of the role of faculty
advisors.

~Thom warned against “‘ov-
ershooting’’ with too ambi-
tious projects and asked for
firm commitments of the sena-
tor’s interest on particular
projects.

The next meeting will be
Monday, January 16, at 8:30
pm in the Conference Room.

Thom impressed me from
the. first by his ability to

listen. He has started off by

running. an open and very

diverse administration. Let’s

hope the euphoria doesn’t
vanish too soon.
