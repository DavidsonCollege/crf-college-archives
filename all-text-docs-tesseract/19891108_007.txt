Wednesday, November 8, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN :

PATTERSON, from page 6

from some individuals, there
were others who appreciated
Patterson’s outspokeness. “It
was refreshing to have a mem-
ber of the Davidson ‘establish-
ment’ whostood by his views,”
said one alumnus.

“He energized the cam-

“Davidson lost someone
who helped to keep us honest,”

Patterson, now in his 70s,
lives in Davidsonand although
he is still very alert, physically
he is limited by Parkinson’s
Disease. He is confident that he
had a positive impact on the
college.

“I hope my legacy to the
college has been to develop
within others a desire to inves-
tigate social and economic
problems that are further re-
moved from one’s immediate
surroundings,” he said, smil-
ing.

Somehow, that doesn’t
seem like a “red” idea at all.
