QUESTION OF THE WEEK

of Chambers, Certainly the old plan
would have more success as far as
money is concerned, but I don't
think that the men would mind
being canvassed for such a purpose
as the Christmas Gift Fund, Every
year this fund is sponsored by the
Y. M. C. A. board and everyone ex-
pects to be canvassed and to con-

tribute to it. The amount is not
overemphasized and I see no rea-
son to change from the other plan.
I think that to send a boy around
to each room one time and ask
him to give, explain the whys and
wherefores of the cause, that the
project would meet with much

more success.

Tea Hounds signed George Rich-
mond and “Black Dog” Hunter as
coaches, and the Rats retailiated
by announcing that they had se-
cured the services of Fred Stair
and Bob “One Foot” McClellan.

The soft drink concession for the
game was given to Wally “Elijah”
Scherer. Bill Lemmon and Bob
Reinhart, super salesmen of Watts,
quickly announced a special on red
and blue earmuffs for the respective
partisans of the two teams.

With this game looming on the
horizon, practically’ all interest in
the Rose Bowl.was forgotten. De-
luged by requests for tickets, the
publicity departments of both dor-
mitories and

were working night
