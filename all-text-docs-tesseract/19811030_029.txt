Here is DB & SS with a reflective
account of homecoming weekend:

The overall success of such a
fun-filled weekend began with the
Highlarid Games. You guessed it, —
sponsored by that ‘witty crew the
Union Board. Spectators were over-
whelmed by the antics of kilted step-
tutors, snack-bar employees, KA
éating house members and David-
sonian film reviewer Nick Graham

himself and “succeed ‘with women.”
The campus foot race was the high-
light of the afterrioon beginning at
Gus’s and finishing up in Rock’s

room. Everyone came out a winner
with only one disqualification

race in Pakistani clothing. All win-

Balidon furnished by Rusk’s Finest,
hot air supplied by Balcom and Gey-
er. Nice disco!

Campa: events were numerous
‘later in the weekend beginning with
the Davidson’ vs. Hampden-Sydney

*: Football game and.ending*up with
the’ Davidson vs. Hampden-Sydney

fund raising carnation. sale. When

asked about the results.:she re-

who came out to make a ‘name for -

awarded to Eric Long for running the

ners recieved a hot air balloon ride. -

Football’ game. Basement Rich
topped off the weékend ‘with their

hall counselor Carol Roche was. .

-—— IMAC with the Doughboys and Slimshafts —

marked, “Such, an endeavor has pro-
duced much hall unity and has in-
creased morale throughout my girls.

We’ve received an extended invita-
tion from the SPEs for an upcoming.
pajama party, but have been forced
to decline the offer due to conflicting

bible studies and DCF revival méet-

ings.”

We’ve considered the exploits of
all non-Greek members of the Da-
vidson community and now its time

to look at the weekend for the pledge
~ kids.

1)Homecoming at PiKA. The

weekend begins-with nineteen tons .

of satid along with the White Cliffs.

of Dover being deposited in the Pi-!
‘KA’ parking lot. By Sunday after-
noon at four o’clock, things have —
been moved into the house’and the °
~ party is ready to go.-At this point the

whole - fraternity along with their
dates gather around the bathtub for a
speech by” soothsayer Johnathan

- West entitled, “How TCan Be Sucha
Slob and Still Get In Raspaphool. e is:

2)Homecoming at KA é Those

crazy disciples of Robert E. Lee
presented’ the Spongetones once

_ again at the house for the entertain-

ment of the brothers. Admission was

- only two dollars for brothers with a -

Homecoming around the Court

reduced rate of $3.99 for those with

dates. During one of the bands

breaks, KA president Eric Crum

presented senior Richard Strader .
with the Stonewall Jackson award .

which is given annually to the non-

KA most. likely to be considered a

KA by the campus community. Eb-

bing with pride Strader replied “This

is just the beginning, my next endea-
vor is Ann Hurt.”

3)Homecoming at SAE. David-.

son .collége has certainly changed

‘over the years. With the addition of a

new. Commons and seven trillion

. bricks, none can deny. that Davidson
has ‘undergone’ quite a facelift: Ob-.
viously , the word has not moved far,
enough down the hill to the SAE

house. Once again this blue-blazered
crowd brought in a former back-up

group for Harold: Melvin and the:
~ Blue Notes to spin the tunes for the
brothers. Those visiting the house -

quickly realized that anyone residing

in the eastern United States was in-
vited to the party, Further details can

be obtained from Jane Alexanian,
Kathy Koolcen, or Connie Terry.
For those of you who did not have

dates, rest assured’ that-Dave Cove

will pemg, back his sister for mid-
winters.

4)Homecoming at Phi Delt. Due
to the escalating construction costs
of fraternity bleachers, the Delts
were unable to have Homecoming
this year. However, they did hold
another truly successful air guitar
contest Saturday night after. the
game.
5)Homecoming at Sig Ep. Still
smarting from the cost of the suc-
cessful Chairman of the Board ¢on-
cert, the Spe’s were also unable to
celebrate Homecoming. However,
after the game Saturday Ralph Tay-
lor did narrate a film of the Whiskey
Sour Pajama Party that attracted a
few earlier this term.
6)Homecoming at Fiji. Again no
Homecoming as all the brothers
passed out from. Thursday night’s
“Upi in Smoke” party and failed to re-
gain conciousness until after lunch
on Sunday.
- - Next week: Doughboys return
with flickerball predictions and up

: close and personal interviews with

individuals who have produced un-
surmountable LSAT Board Scores.

Also: Davidsonian editor» ‘John
Seman receives commendation from
The National Enquirer on his jour- —
nalistic format .and: Russ Summerell
will conduct a seminar on “how to
rid yourself of an unwanted date.”
