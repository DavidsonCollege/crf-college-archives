Cat Nips
Skiing: it
ain't hoops

By Jason Byassee

I made the mistake of being
out of town on Saturday night,
when Davidson took on Tennes-
see-Chattanooga in hoops.

Not only was my decision to
go skiing rather than watch the
game a sign of being a poor
Davidson fan, it also smacks of
bad journalism: Alas, here I am
writing acolumn abouta game that
I wasn’t even at. A few months
back I myself fussed at anybody I

knew who didn’t go to the UNCC |

game, which turned out to be the
season’s first big victory. Allow
me to come before you as a peni-
tent sports writer.

You see, this was supposed to
be a column about the upcoming
Carolina-Duke game on Wednes-
day night. I was gonna talk about
the tradition, the rivalry, the na-
tional rankings and stuff, but the
Wildcats didn’t let me. The UTC
game wasa big win and apparently
an unbelievable game, so I’Il tell
you about it from my poor fan/
poor journalist point of view.

All last week the game was
being talked about. “Big game Sat-
urday, eh?” was one of the most
oft-repeated phrases on Davidson’s
campus, and rightfully so. UTC
had beaten us on their court over
Christmas and had a share of the
lead in the Southern Conference.
We were coming off a big win at
Georgia Southern, and were fourth
in the conference. A win would
keep Davidson in the upper ech-
elon of the league standings, a loss
would mean a .500 record again.
And I went skiing. Oops.

When I returned late Saturday
night the first person I saw was a
hallmate and fellow basketball fan.
His voice was gone for all the
shouting he had done from the
stands that night, and his first words
to me were, “How ‘bout that
game!?” At that point the error of
non-attendance was discerned.

He went on to tell me about
Mr. Alpert’s heroics, the second
half comeback, the horrible offici-
ating, and all the other things that
not only made that game, but that
also make college basketball ev-
erything it is. It must have been
fantastic.

It got me to thinking. In com-
ing to Davidson we’ve supposedly
given up the perks of a larger
school, like big-time college sports,
for the sake of a close-knit, aca-
demic environment. If you’re like
me, you wish sometimes that you
could camp out for basketball tick-
ets with your friends or tailgate
outside a football stadium full of
50,000 people. So when Davidson
sports teams do go out and win
some big games, it’s exciting stuff.

This basketball team has the
talent and the coaching to keep
winning big ones like they did Sat-
urday night. A few March South-
ern Conference Tournament wins

"What makes him so good is his relentlessness in the way he
plays the game. When you have a passion for success that he
has, you can see why he is such a good player."

-Men's Basketball Coach Bob McKillop on Janko Narat

J anko Narat: The go- “to guy

By Matt Pitzer

Situation: Davidson leads
Tennessee-Chattanooga by one
point with less than twenty sec-
onds to play. The designed play
is for guard Chris Alpert to try
to pass the ball to senior/for-
ward Janko Narat on the post.

Alpert delivered the ball to
Narat less than five feet from
the basket. There Narat is
quickly double-teamed. What
to do? Try to force the shot,
hoping to draw a foul? Try to
force a pass to the other side of
the court?

No, he calmly passes back
to Alpert, whose defender has
left him to help guard Narat.
Alpert then easily drains a three-
pointer to seal the victory for
the Wildcats.

- While a simple play, it this
sequence illustrsated the lead-
ership Janko Narat has provided
the men’s basketball team this
year. The statistics tell the story

easily enough, He not only

leads the team in scoring at 17.7
points per game, but the 6-foot-
7 native of Domzale, Slovenia
also leads the team with 5.8
rebounds per game.

“What makes him so
good,” coach Bob McKillop
says, “is his relentlessness and
the way he plays the game.
When you have the passion for
success that he has, you can see
why he is such a good player.
Its a passion that has developed
from seeing his homeland dev-
astated by war, which has con-
tributed to his drive to perform
well.”

But that passion still did
not prepare Janko Narat for the
differences between American
basketball and the European
game. Some of those differ-
ences were overcome during his
attendance at Fort Union Mili-
tary Academy in Virginia. Be-
sides learning the style of play
on this side of the ocean, Narat
had his first taste of success as

his team finished 24-1 during his
senior year. In addition, all five
Starters received Division I schol-
arships.

“He was a top catch,” says
McKillop. “We knew when he
committed to Davidson that we
hada steal.” Asking the coach to
describes Narat’s strengths is lik-
ing asking for a description of
the perfect basketball player. He
can score inside and outside,
moves well without the ball, and
can be an outstanding defender.

Despite having all of those
abilities, Janko has found still
another area needing improve-
ment this season.

“He’s been drawing more
and more fouls this year,” says
his coach. “He finishes plays in
traffic and in the paint better than
he ever used to.”

Narat has evolved asa silent
leader for this year’s basketball
team, one that is enjoyiny the

Come back
secures big
win for Cats

By Matt Pitzer
It was, as Chris Alpert said, “like
getting the monkey off our back.”
Davidson’s 72-71 win here Saturday |
over Tennessee-Chattanooga was the first
‘over the Moccasins since the 1987-88 sea-
son, and it kept Davidson in contention for

|| the conference title, especially with six of

its nine games in Belk Arena.

Saturday’s win followed a comeback
from a 16-point first half deficit, and it
followed a first half in which it looked as if
the Moccasins could do anything they
wanted.

It followed a three-pointer by Alpert
with 11 seconds remaining in the game on
a perfectly executed play. It also followed
a matching three-pointer by Brandon Born
with three seconds left that provided the
final margin. After Born’s shot, the Wild-
cats dribbled off the remaining time for
another big win in a season that has already
seen wins over UNCC, NC State, and~
Clemson.

Janko Narat led Davidson (12-5, 6-4
SC) with 18 points, while Brandon Will-
iams added 15 and Alpert 13. George Spain
chipped in 11. The loss dropped the Moc-
casins (13-5, 7-3) out of the conference
lead.

In the first half, and especially during
a two and a half minute stretch in which
UTC ran off 16 straight points, it looked as
if the Moccasins could do no wrong and the
Wildcats could do little right.

UTC marched down the floor and
quickly put up the shot that it wanted, and
59% of those shots went in during the 1st
half, including 7 of 12 three-pointers.
Davidson, meanwhile, struggled for the
most part to get good looks at the basket
and often was forced to take tough shots,
resulting in 45% 1st half shooting.

“We shot the ball too quickly in the
first half,” coach Bob McKillop said. “We
didn’t have patience on offense, we didn’t
get the ball inside to score.”

The most damaging part of the open-
ing period was the 16-0 run that started
following a time-out with 14:53 to play.
When it ended with Copeland’s 2 free
