HACKNEY DODGES SEWANEE’S BEARDEN

About The ’Cats

In regard to the game last Saturday night between the
Wildcats of Davidson and the Tigers of Sewaneé, we would
like to quote an ancient proverb by Confucius or one of those
fellers, to-wit: “He who didn’t get money’s worth is nuts.”
Seldom has a more thrilling battle been waged than was un-
furled before the spectators in the first meeting between these
two ancient and esteemed institutions.

Take the first Sewanee score, for instance. The ball
rested on the Tig seven, third down and seven to go, as
the second quarter opened, with the Wildcats: apparently
in complete control of the situation. Then Earl Beardon
passes to Woody Dunn who laterals to Frank Walker who
runs thirty yards all by himself and bingo, Sewanee has
a TD.

é Davidson struck right back, with Dave Spencer, Johnny
“Fredericks, and Claude Hackney running, passing,..and doing
just about anything to drive over for the score, tieing the
Things rocked along mildly with only three

count at 6-6.
touchdowns being scored in the second and third periods.

It was in the last quarter that “Old Man Thrill Kicked
the Bucket” really and truly. With only six minutes of
playing time remaining in the game, Sewanee held a 20-13
lead that looked as safe as the Rock of Gibralter. Then
with Davidson in possession of the pigskin on the Sewanee
40, Fredericks dropped back and threw a long pass to
Hackney who was wide open on the ten. Bob Johnson
again came through with the pressure on and split the
uprights with a perfect placement. :

About three minutes of the game remained as Davidson
kicked off to Sewanee. A wild pass wandered into the arms
of Dave Spencer and the 'Cats took possession of the ball on
the ten yard line. Three’playslater Spencer shot through the
line from the four and turned a tie into glorious victory. Just
for good measure, Johnson again kicked the extra point.

en it comes to singling out any of the Davidson
team_as. individual stars, the task is_an extremely. difficult
one. Fredericks’ accurate passing, Spencer’s fine running,
and Hackney’s pass receiving are the most noticeable
events in the victory. However, the play of the Wildcat
line was the best seen on the Richardson field in many a
moon. Jim Crutchfield’s savage down-field blocking, Bob
Smith’s pass receiving, Don Bell’s and Hank Bahnson’s
excellent tackling, are worthy of note, among many other
things.

The two men probably least noticed contributed as much,
if not. more, than any other men on the field. Bob Johnson,
playing his usual ferocious game at guard, broke through
time and time again t@ spill the ball-carrier hard behind the
line. Jay Bolin, backing up the line and working in the short
back position on offense, picked up valuable yardage through-
out the game on center sneaks.

As much as we hate to see either team lose such a tight
battle, we are naturally glad to see the Wildcats win the
opener in what this corner sincerely hopes will be a long
rivalry. Sewanee is our type of school and we are sincerely
looking forward to our games of the future with the lads
from “The Oxford’of the South.”

Chatter

Interesting to note that Centre has had scouts at every
one of our games this year. . . Coach Little went out to look
over the Praying Colonels a week ago and got to within 80
miles of where the game was supposed to be played, only to
find that the Colonels had foxed him and played the night
before. . . Kentucky and Notre Dame are the only big-time
teams that still use a balanced line. By the way, the Irish
used only 67 men in routing Carnegie Tech 61-0 last week. . .
Preston Johnston, Southern Methodist star, followed up his
92 yard punt of a few weeks ago with a run of the same dis-
tance as the Mustangs beat Auburn 20-13.

Hillers Nose
Out Kittens

An improved. Davidson. freshman~
eleven, still #eeking their first taste
of victory, bowed to the heavy
Mars. Hill team last Friday after-
noon in Richardson Stadium in a
game that saw the lead change
four times.

Making seven first downs to the
Mars Hillers’ six, the Kittens out-
played the visitors in every de-
partment except kicking. The long,
high punts of Edwards proved ef-
fective, and time and time again
put the Kittens back deep in their
territory with his quick kicks.

Davidson was first to score when
in the first quartér Bruce flipped
the oval to Williams on his 20, who
ran the remaining distance for the
score. Bethea’s try for conversion
was good. The mountaineers came
back in the second stanza to tie
the score when Smith swept right
end into pay dirt. Carr’s place-
ment split the uprights for the
extra point.

Kittens Launch Drive

Ip the second half the Dayidson
first-year men launched a 66-yard
march sparked by’ Bethea and
Bruce, running up four first downs
before scoring. Again it was Be-
thea who smashed the center for
the tally. The extra points was
gained by a placement by Bruce.
A few seconds later, McGeachy
took two short passes from Carr
which were good for six points.
Carr again converted and the score
was tied, 14-14,

Determined to score again, Mars
Hill halted several long drives but
the Kittens and then took posses-
Sion of the pigskin on their own
29-yard stripe after an exchange
of punts. McGeachy hit the center
of the line, broke loose into the
secondary and raced over the goal
to put the visitors in the lead

again, 20-14.

Wakes Win
In the two circuit battles last
week, North Carolina defeated a

tough N. C. State 13-7, and Wash-
ington and Lee eked out a 3-0 vic-
tory over a _ favered Richmond
eleven. Most of the Southern Con-
ference teams played intersectional
games last week, with Duke’s 13-0
victory Colgate pacing the
way. Other teams in the victory
column last week were Davidson
with a 27-20 victory over Sewanee;
Wake Forest overcame Marshall
College 31-19; VMI upset Virginia
7-0, and William and Mary ran
