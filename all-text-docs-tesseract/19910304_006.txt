play the game”! Finally, that if
Jerry Tarkanian can start his sen-
iors in their last home-game, then
why can’t Bob McKillop? All of
this with a lead-in referring to re-
moving anatomy parts from vari-
ous orifices.

Some people speak of reaching
into the depths of the soul and
finding whatever it takes to rise to
occasions, etc., and they do it with
an authority which confirms the
wisdom of the ages. Perhaps it is
time for certain individuals to con-
sider removing anatomy parts from
clouds and trying to geta picture of
the real world.

I am not going to go into a
discussion of X’s and O’s and what
kinds of decisions or mistakes
dictate whether a game is won or
lost. There isn’t time or space. I
will, however, address the issue of
Coach McKillop’s alleged disre-
gard for the members of the
Davidson basketball team. The
concern that Coach McKillop has
shown and continues to display
(even though it may not be public
knowledge) goes far beyond win-
ning or losing basketball games.

Yes, at Davidson, the word
student-athlete still does have
meaning, and Coach McKillop
does everything in his power to
positively affect the lives of his
players both on and off the court,
in season and during vacation peri-
ods. This is done for all squad-
members, regardless whorecruited
them.

The Davidson team practices a
conceptin which, 99 out 100 times,
a person gets what he deserves. If
that were true in all areas of our
society, a great many things would
be different. The senior game is
one game out of a season. A sea-

son which for all intent and pur-
pose begins in September. A sea-
son in which the players put in
countless hours of hard work. ALL
THE PLAYERS. Not just the
seniors! They, for the lack of a
better word, reward for perform-:
ing all of your required tasks better
than other members of the team is
the privilege of starting a game,

playing that game as hard as you.’

can, and maybe even winning it.

It would certainly be nice to
say, “who cares, it’s senior night,
we'll start all the seniors!” Isn’t it
just possible that that would be
unfair to those other players who
have worked so hard for that op-
portunity?

There is a great deal of evaluat-
ing and soul-searching which goes
into deciding whom torecruit, who
plays which positions, who starts,
and who plays for how long.
Someone is always going to get
hurt. It’s no fun sitting behind a
senior, simply because he is a
senior.

Sometimes you do what you
have to do until you can do what
you want to do.

PS.
Senior Night University of
Nevada Las Vegas vs. Cal Irvine

Final Score: UNLV 116, Cal
Irvine 86.

Four of the six starters were
already starters, two of them, Larry
Johnson and Stacey Augmon, are
consensus All-American candi-
dates.

UNLV is 25-0 overall, and 16-
0 in the conference. Irvine is 9-19
overall and 4-12 in the conference.
I’d say the Davidson:UNLV /
McKillop:Tarkanian comparison is
a valid one!

Howe Questions Ms. Davidson

Dear Editor:

I received my copy of the
February 4 issue of The
Davidsonian today, and I became
irate after reading the letter from
Ms. Liz Davidson in the Opinions
section of that paper.

I wish that I could say that lam
sorry that Ms. Davidson is
“ured of the rampant feminism on
[the Davidson] campus.” However,
I am not sorry at all. What avenue
would Ms. Davidson suggest that
Sara Carlson and other Davidson
feminists pursue when they wish
to air their grievances, I wonder?
The Davidsonian is a forum for all
Davidson students to utilize, re-
gardless of their persorial view-
points. It’s traditionally referred to
as the First Amendment. Ms.
Davidson has exercised her right
to the freedom of the press; Ms.
Carlson and others are entitled to
do the same. 2

My second problem with Ms.
Davidson’s letter is that she ap-
pears to minimize the significance
of sexual discrimination. Contrary
to her belief, it is not a common
~ occurrence for women to “cry ‘sex
discrimination’ when they don’t
' achieve what they wankioachicve.”

A woman who accuses a male
employer or business associate of
discrimination subjects herself to
intense personal scrutiny and often
toa stressful legal battle. The deci-
sion tocome forward with acharge
of sexual discrimination is not one
that woman is apt to take lightly.

Tomy knowledge, noone who
has written to the editors of this
paper has claimed that men are
responsible “for all women’s mis-
fortunes.” Not even the most radi-
cal Davidson feminists have gone
that far. However, I do not think
that any open-minded student at
Davidson can assert with convic-
tion that men do not continue to
discriminate against women, both
in the workplace and elsewhere. .

Furthermore, itis NOT “bitchy
and irrational” to draw attention to
these injustices where they exist.
Indeed, to even make such a state-
ment is appalling and insulting.

Iam nota feminist myself, but
I am tolerant of those who wish to
espouse feminist principles and to
express their opinions. Perhaps Ms.
Davidson should make an attempt
to do the same.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Howe, ‘92

Depth, Relevance!

The Moral Implications of Ants

You know those anecdotes
preachers tell to kick off sermons?
Some story from real life catches
their attention and, wouldn’t you
know. it,-extrapolates nicely into
the divine.

One of my favorites involvesa

eockroach: “People, have you ever
noticed a cockroach dead on the
floor. It’s lying there on its back,
joints stiffened and bereft of spirit
when suddenly it rises up on a
thousand tiny legs and marches
towards the door.

_ “Younever even saw the little
ant scouts coming, one by one,
then by twos and tens until hun-
dreds of the efficient creatures
crouched beneath the bulk of the
gigantic monster and heaved as
one.

“In the presence of that roach,
people, any one individual of those
ants appeared as one of us, you or
me, before a battleship. But they
worked together, people, and got
to down that sucker’s guts like a
Slurpie because no one ant ran off
with a leg all to himself.”

The moral, like many morals,
is teamwork and Biblical citations
follow.

Coincidentally enough, some-
thing similar happened to me in the
library recently. While I napped in
one of the carrells next to the rail-
ing which overlook the first floor,
the growing E.H. Little ant popu-
lation must have developed a han-
kering for fine literature.

As 1 awoke. from uneasy
dreams I found Kafka’s Metamor-

phasis transformed on my desk
into a gigantic insect. ‘It tottered

towards me and I almost fled be-
fore recognizing that it was only
ants.

I think they just couldn’t find
anything better in the library to
hoist but, to ensure that language

would never fall into the hands of
brute beasts, I played Godzilla and
beat the heroic troup into a seg-
mented goop smear.

Frequent occupants of the
aforementioned carrells knoW that,
in certain areas of the library, the
antsare reproducing like, well, ants.
I planned to get peeved about this
petty detail in my column. Like the
preacher, however, I found myself
growing fond of the little guys.

Students Should Take
Notice of the Environment

This week at Davidson the
Dean Rusk Program will sponsor
yet another timely conference on
pressing international issues. The
topic of this year’s conference
“Towards a Healthy Global Envi-
ronment” is timely indeed. In the
wake of an environmentally disas-
trous war in the Persian Gulf, we
are once again reminded that pro-
tection of the environment is-a
common duty for all the world’s
citizens. It is a responsibility of all
the world’s nations as well.

Noticeably, the Bush admini-

stration has not beena global leader
in this arena. Adopting the basic
Reagan era environmental policies
of business-as-usual-and-business-
‘first, America continues to sell its
future generations short in pursuit
of short-term economic payoffs.
To date most American initia-
tives have been half-measure and
offered reluctantly. The President’s
latestenergy “initiatives” leave one
either laughing or crying. And
international environmental efforts
have received greater obstruction
than leadership from the United
States. How depressing that the

. world’s greatest economic and

political power should neglect

actions of self interest common

‘with the entire world in order to
secure exclusive selfish interests.

The United States should seize
the initiative, muster its political
and economic strength, and lead
the way in pushing for stronger do-
mestic and global environmental
legislation. President Bush should

could do to the library if we linked
hands, legs and souls in spontane-
ous transmogrification and became
one functional organism dedicated
to hoisting stuff. We could move
not just books but shelves of books. —
Copy machines would be cake
and the stairway wouldn’tstanda
chance. Just imagine, the entire.
900’s section airborne at once.

Well, imagined it, and it’s not
as greatas you'd think. Ants might
enjoy that sortof stuff, but people
need more worthwhile pastimes.
As humans we’d want a goal,
which wouldn’ tbe difficultto find.

We could each one of us take
in hand an instrument of encour-
agement: a megaphone, a well-
thought-out essay, brass knuck-
les or aged tomatoes. We, or the
creature that we’d become, could
scurry on 2800 legs downto Baker
and hang out with the round-ball
gurus.

Perchance they’d be interested
to know that starting seniors on
senior night might not imply a
threat to their authority. Maybe
it’s just a nice thing to-do.

Just maybe an underclassman
student athlete will get over the
emotional trauma of sitting his
talented butt on the bench for 3
minutes while the other students in
the stands have a good scream.

I know this poses a dangerous
threat to team chemistry and proba-
bly blows our chances in the
NCAA's. But you know, we at the
Davidsonian justhate to see wasted
a golden opportunity. for the ex-
pression of hearty, wholesome and
old fashioned collegiate pep.

we will have succumbed to the

human abuse, will take care of

into
America’s soil, will only poison
the credibility of his high office
which has made so many previous
empty promises to clean up our
world.

So let us read the President’s
lips. And let us hold him to his

word. If we do not remain con- .
