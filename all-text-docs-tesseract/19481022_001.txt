‘Signs Of The Times’

By PETE KALOGRIDIS

Doctor Peter K. Kinmons of the
Westminister Presbyterian Chureh
Seranton, Vennsylvania, was

guest speaker in-chapel Wednesday

|

morning. In addition to holding the

two | presidency of the Board of Trustees

are well known for their collabora-! of Princeton Theological Seminary,

tion in zany musical shows.

| Doctor EnYmons is viee chairman

Ashmore was elected president| of the Board of Foreign Missions of

of the council when the new repre-
Sentatives were installed last spring.
His resignation was given on the
grounds that the job was demand-
ing more time than his studies and
athletic activities would allow.

A recent conference with mecical

school authorities convinced Ash-
more that grades are of primary
importance at this time. Another

reason Jake gives for his resigna-
tion the fact that football and
basketball activities will prevent his
being present at both the Home-
coming and Midwinters dances.
In his new position as president,

1s

Scruggs will head the Pan-Hellenic |

Council's main function of sponsor-

ing the three dance sets of the year. |

The first set, Homecoming, is al-
ready planned with Billy Knauf's
Band signed up for the music-mak-
ing. Present plans call for the sign-
ing of a name band for the Mid-
winters set in late February. As
yet no plang have been announced
for the Spring Frolics set which
held in April.

Other activities of the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council are to set up and en-
force rules of rushing and to regu-
late over-all fraternity pdlicy.

IRC To Sponsor
Political Debate

The International Relations Club
will meet Tuesday evening in the
basement of the Science Hall. At
this meeting the members will be
shown an army filth, “The Seeds
of Destiny.” This picture was pre-
sented the Academy Award in 1946
for the year’s most
documentary film, Although the
picture is two years old, its subject
still revelant to the present
world situation. The general theme
of the picture is the privation of
Germany’s_ youth in their war-torn
country. A preview of this film
will be shown to the faculty on
Monday.

A debate will be held two
members on the subject, “Re-
actionaries in the Republican party
will take. over the nation’s foreign
policy.” After the debate an open
forum will be held to discuss any
questions pertaining to the topic.
Following this discussion the IRC
paper, the United Newsletter, will
be distributed to the members.

called “comediamania.”
The discovery of this disease was |
made in 1946. by the eminent pys-

chiatrist, Dr- Spinboom J. Raffle-
bottom, of “Happy Jack” Hopkins
Hospital.

The story of Scrugks and Up-
church really begins when they were
in the seventh grade at the Alex-
ander Graham school in Charlotte.
The zanies had been friends for a
long time ,but weren't very close

In October 1946, the eovern
ment completed the. erection of

of the married veterans and their] ;
families who were unable» to find
living accommodations in Davidson. |

Due to the restricted meomes
the veterans, the government fixed }
the rent at $13.00 per month ex |
cept for those few students tie cl
incomes exceeded $1500.00 annually. |

In September, 1948, the govern
ment gave Davidson College the]
entire project. Thereupon, the offices
of the College Treasurer informed
the occupants that there would b
some change in the rent rates. Phe
students felt) that. the rent Shou
be lowered due to the anadequacy
of the apartments and the high cost
of heating them, but at a* meeting
which included the college treasurer
and the occupants, a rate of $15.00
per month was set and agreed
upon

However, the occupants have re
| ceived a second letter which made
no mention of the agreement, but

The cost of erection of the apart
ments was borne entirely by. the
government, The investment oft the

which was the cost of water main
