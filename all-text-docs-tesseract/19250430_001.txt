Davidson Nine Defeats
Guilford in Fast Game |
As Players S Shake Jinx

Wildcats Come Out. Out of: Slump and

VANCE HITS HOME-RUN

Game Turns Into Slugfest in Early |
Innings—Davidson Leads
After Second

Coming out of a slump which the team
has been in all season, the Davidson Wild-
cats very decisively defeated Guilford in a
* baseball game in which the hitting of the
entire’ Davidson team was the outstanding
feature. As Davidson had played
games and lost all of them, the
team had high hopes of adding a victory from
Davidson to their string

nine

of victories
when in the first two innings the Davidson
team scored eight runs off Gray, Guilford’s
strong left-hander. The score at the con-
clusion of the game was 16 to 11, and there
was exactly that much difference the
playing of the two teams.

Both teams used three pitchers, the Da-
vidson pitchers allowing three less hits than

in:

the Guilford pitchers, and gave up but one |

base on balls, while the Guilford hurlers al-
lowed three. Gray started off for Guilford,
but lasted only one inning, being removed in
the second, after the Davidson team had
scored eight times without a man being out.
Thomas, his successor, faired but little bet-
ter, and was taken out in the sixth inning,
after he had given up five hits and two bases
on balls, for a total of six runs. Smith fin-
ished the game, and pitched the best game of
the trio. Oden started for Davidson, . but
was succeeded by Laird in the second i inning,
after he had been hit on the middle finger |
of his pitching hand, and was unable to |

Wildcat Orators Victors
In Presbyterian Contest

Avalanche of Keen Logic and Con- |
vincing Eloquence Wins for
Davidson Debaters

Overwhelmed by an avalanche of keen
logic and convincing eloquence, the plucky |
debating team from Presbyterian College
succumbed to the brilliant trio of Wildcat
forensic artists on last Friday evening, when

the two well-known rivals met in their first |

forensic encounter,

The South Carolina debaters, E. T. Wil-
son, D. D., Edmunds, and J. D. McInnis, up-
held the Negative of the query, “Resolved,
That Congress should be empowered to over-
rule by a two-thirds vote decisions of the
Supreme Court which declare acts of Con-
gress-unconstitutional,” against A. M. Mar-
tin, B. U. Ratchford, and H, L, Shaw, the
Davidson team. The decision was four to
one for Davidson.

A. M. (Piggy) Martin opened the attack
for Davidson with a masterly definition of
the query and a concise summary of the af-
firmative’s scheme of proof. He vividly pic-
tured the court's common encroachments up-
on leislative powers and demonstrated the
evils of such policy.

E. T. Wilson launched the negative offen-
sive by graphically portraying the dangers
of the affirmative policy. He also outlined
the constitutional basis for this power of the
supreme court.

Students Go Over
The Top in Queens
College se Campaign

Under the impetus of a week of boosting
and ballyhooing, Davidson students went over
| the top last Wednesday and Thursday in the
lecombined drive for funds for Queens Col-
| lege, Charlotte, and the Hangehow Chris-
tion College, China. A corps of room-to-
| room canvassers visited every room on the
{campus during the two nights of the cam-
paign last week, and secured subscriptions to
the two causes from an unusually large per-

| centage of the students. Incomplete re-

turns from the two drives credited Davidson

students with subscriptions totalling $5,753
\for the two colleges, $4,525 of which \was
subscribed to Queens College, and the re

maining $1,228 going to the Hangchow
| Christian College.

These figures were compiled before a
number of the students and faculty mem-

and leaders in the
two campaigns expressed confidence that the
amounts would be boosted considerably when
the entire student body had been interviewed.

The campaign was conducted after special
j exercises in chapel Wednesday, when several

Tennis Team Wins

Saturday night another of Davidson‘s win-
ning teams returned to the hill, bringing back
| with them the scalps of some of the largest

| schools in the east.

| The tennis team, composed of Price, Beall,
| Staley, Trotter and McCutchen, left David-
| son last Monday, April 20th, on their eastern
|trip. Five matches were played, and, except
| for the meet with Aannapolis, the Davidson
team emerged victorious.

| Tom Staley went through the entire trip
| without losing a single match.
man on the team was McCutchen, who
played especially well, dropping only two
| single matches, these to men Union
| Seminary and Navy.

| It might be said that the outstanding player
met_on the trip was Bradley, an old David-
ison man, of Union Seminary, who defeated
Harry Price, 6-3, 7-5.

The University Maryland was met
Tuesday, and the final score was 6-1 in favor
of Davidson.

The anxiety of six hundred Wildcats was

the signing was made by Dr. J. M. Douglas,
head of the atheletic department of David-
