Question of
The Week

Last year, a new set of election
rules went into effect. Some of the
elections were held under the new
rules at that-time but since they
were new the defects, if any, were
not evident. Since we have had a
year think over the rules and
now have seen them again in effect
could you name any faulty points?
If so name them and state what
you think would be an improvement
on the rules as they now stand.

to

Chase Brenizer, Jr., Senior

An election should be for the sole
purpose of electing a candidate on
this own merit and ability in the un-
biased opinion of the indivdual
voter, rather than for shoyvng him
in or keeping him out because of
petty fraternal grievances or the
solicitations and bribes of rank pol-
iticians. For this reason I think that
our. present election_rules regarding
combines and soliciting votes are
absolutely necessary and serve as a
vital factor to kegp our elections
free from graft.
Tommy Brown, Junior

I think the creation of the Elec-
tions Board has been a definite im-
provement in the regulation of the
lecti at David But I don’t
know whether even it will eliminate
solicitors. But why wouldn’t open
politics work at Davidson? The
Student Body is growing each year
and _it is especially hard for Fresh-
men to vote for the best candidate.
It would make the Student Body
more interested and
Student Government.
Jim Kerr, Junior

I imagine that very few of us feel
that combines are éxactly on the
level, and any festrictions on them
would be well-directed. However,
with combines barred I see no rea-
son for the prohibition
politics. I myself miss the oppor:
tunity of arguing
about the relative merits of the va-
rious candidates In
spite of the regulations against it, I
have been approached and my vote
for a certain candidate solicited
Now, I had no objection to that, but
what irked me was that we had to
argue in whispers, and did so with
a somewhat furtive feeling. Why
not have election parades, demon-
strations, what-not? They
would add color to a rather drab
routine affair. Why not let oppos-
ing candidates campaign, let
their-supporters campaign a bit for
them? I'd enjoy it. Open politics
exist elsewhere; why not have them
here?
Johnny Moore, Senior

The most apparent defect at this
time, as I see it, is not in the method
of voting but the ambiguity of sec-
tion 2 of the by-laws which explain
the method of progressive balloting
There are apparently many loop
holes in this rule and if these could
be remedied by an amendment, |
think the situation would be greatly

Jim Crook, Junior

A close inspection when these
elections are over should be very
revealing as to the way the new
rules are working. As has been
shown already, the elections for

Student Body Officers have been
close and would have furnished the
acid test for any election system.
As yet I can not say how well the
new rules could be better carried
out. As I recall the rules say that
no votes shall be tabulated except
in the Student Council room and
then by members of the Elections
Board only. I have seen the votes
counted in public, at the polls while
voting was going on. Naturally the
results will get out in this way and
the early returns may influence later
voting very definitely. I would not
criticize the present system but
would like to urge the Elections
Board to carry out the existing rules
more carefully, particularly when
elections are as closely contested as
those of the past ten days have
been.
Holt Barnwell, Senior

1 think this present system is
decidedly better than the previous
one, but it is far from being perfect.
One point I find is the right of
Freshmen to vote, because in the
most cases a Freshman has no idea
who he is voting for, and gets influ-
enced very easily and since the
Freshmen class is so large, I do not
think they should have this right to
vote blindly. As for politics, in gen-
eral, I am definitely against it, but
I see no alternative since our sys-
tem requires officers and votings.
Bill Connor, Sophomore

I have no criticism to make of the
election rules; I think that they are
as complete and.as practical for.our
student government elections. I
have two general considerations to

Summer School Will
Start On June 18th

Six Weeks Session to Offer
Full Year's Work In
Eleven Subjects.

June 18 is the date that has
been set for the opening of the
1940 summer school session.
Professor F. K. Fleagle, dean
of the summer session, made
this announcement to the Da-
vidsonian,
Professor Fleagle stated that
school will last for six weeks, June
18 to July 25. The first of these an-
nual summer sessions was offered
in 1928, and classes have been held
for a six week period every sum:
mer since that date.
Courses Listed.

The following courses will be of-
fered to students: accounting, Bi-
ble, biology, chemistry, English,
French, history, mathematics, mu-
sic, physics, and Spanish. A course
in any subject not listed will be or-
ganized if as many as six Students
request it.

One year's work is offered during
the summer, that is, six hours of
academic work or eight hours of a
laboratory course.

With the exception of classes in
science courses, all classes will be
conducted in the mornings. Two
75 minute class periods will be held
each morning

Fees Announced.

The tuition for the summer ses-
sion will amount to $30. Rooms
may be obtained in the dormitories
for $12.50, and the laundry fee will
be $450. A damage deposit of
$3.00) will be charged; this, of
course, will be returned at the end
of the session if it is not used up.

The laboratory fees are less than
those charged for the regular win-
ter course. These feeg are: for

physics, $5; for biology, $6; and
for chemistry, $12.

The enrollment for last summer's
classes totaled about 130; Professor
Fleagle the belief that
the the 1941 session
will be about the same.

No courses are offered for teach-
ers. Since the enrollment of most
summer schools is made up largely
of taking teachers’ courses,
the number of students for these
sessions is not as large as it might
otherwise be. Valuable courses are
however, which would
