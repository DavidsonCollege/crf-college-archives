Senior Speaking Brings Many Fair
Visitors To Our Campus

They’ve gone; and they left with
the memory of a large time. Our
Senior class has certainly been hon-
ored with the presence of girls, very
pretty girls, from every one_of the
Soutlreastern States, from Florida
to Tennessee. They came on Fri-
day, 74 strong, and not once was
heard the old call, “Fire,” for it
didn't take long to get used to them.
* The student body was glad to see so
many of the alumni back to see their
alma mater again, ahd the more
often they return the better. The

Memory to the Class of ’20

lSome Spoke, Some Recited and

Others Read—Flickering Lights
Cause Much Annoyance
to the Speakers

Senior Speaking is over, That is

the big fact to the members of the
lass of ‘20. Some had prepared
long and carefully and acquitted
themselves with proportional credit.
Others had made less careful prep-
aration, and this fact’ was evident.
But no matter how they performed,
the Seniors are glad it’s done.

‘Many of the speeches were ex-
cellent in composition and were well
delivered; some lacked either one or
both of these qualities. But as a
whole, the speaking was good. It
was '20’s second experience in pub-
lic oratorical exercises, and this fact
was reflected in the fact that not so
much nervousness was shown. Sev-
eral of the speakers had had the
broadening experience of overseas
service and spoke on some phase of
the life of the soldier.

Of course, there was, as always,
a good deal of reference to papers;
one or two speakers had frankly to
read theirs.

C. H. Cathey gave a discussion of
tobacco as an evil and a bencfit that
went straight to the heart of many
addicts in the audience. And where
there’s smoke there must be fire; so
Chalmers discussed “The Girl We
All Are After.”

The Farmer, of The International
Nation, Improved Our State, in
spite of the fact that Nations De-
cay, and found The Race Problem
A Paramount Problem in Recon-
struction along with Irish Home
Rule which appeared to be a Mod-
ern Red Death. Stand Up and Fight
developed into a case of standing up
and reading. The Impetus of Grea:
Action was so strong that ou its
wave the rest of the section went
through gloriously into the bliss of
Ye Goode Old Days. The Doom of
Autocracy was only an Aftermath.

show was over—the class of 1920
had had its last forensic experience.

schestra and Cathey Were the
Shining Stars

To say that the concert given by
the Davidson Glee Club and Orches-
tra last Saturday night was a suc-

cess would be to speak the truth. It
was one of the best concerts that
has been given at Davidson for
many years. A large audience was
present, and the many encores
showed their appreciation of the
several numbers.

The concert opened with a selec-
tion by the Orchestra. This was
followed by “College Ties,” given
by the Glee Club. Next was a piano
solo by M. A. Tremain, after which
the Orchestra gave another selec-
tion. The Quartet then sang “Go
to Sleep,” by De ‘Haven, accompa-
nied by Carl Cathey in a humorous
sketch, and was encored_ severai
times. Next came a solo by A. G.
Oltman. The first part of the pro-
gram closed with “By the Cam
Fire,” given by the Glee Club.

In the intermission the football
letters were awarded to the Varsity
team.

The program again opened with
a selection by the Orchestra. The
Glee Club next gave “Tulip Time.”
This was followed by a solo by B.
E. Shields, “On the Road to Manda-
lay.” Next the Quartet gave
“Mandy” with the Glee Club joining
on the chorus. After this one of the
most popular numbers of the even-
ing was the character sketch by
Carl Cathey. The Quartet and Glee
Club gave another selection, “Caro-
lina Sunshine.” The concert closed
with “OQ Davidson,” by the Glee

FIAPRIY CALLE
IN THE UNIVERSAL, SPEOUML ATTRACTION.
‘THE RIDER OF THE LAW”

Much Pleasure

Rain Has No Terrors for Fair Vis.
itors VW/ho Crowd the Halls

Among the most attractive fea-
tures of Senior Speaking was the
fraternity reception given last Sat-
urday night at 10 o’clock in honor of
its many guests. It was as an en-
joyable occasion as was ever given
on the Hill. Attractive visitors from
both Carolinas and other Southern
States, including many girls from
nearby colleges, received the hospi-
tality of the fraternity men.

In spite of the inclentency of the
weather, which made it very un-
pleasant to venture out, each fra-
ternity entertained a number of
guests and received visits from the
attractive visitors of the other fra- .
ternities,

The halls were very neatly deco-
rated. Here and there in a corner
you could see a social lion with a
dress suit. The Seniors, from all

Pj appearances, must have found that

speeches in private, to the fair sex,
were much to, be preferred than
those in public, to the fair sex.
After the reception was well un-
der way the visitors were escorted
'by the gentlemen to the other halls.
Punch, sandwiches and cakes were
served by each fraternity to the
visitors. A general good time was
indulged in by all, After making the
rounds of the halls, the groups re-
turned to their respective halls and
bade each other adieu for the night.

ABUSED, BUT HAPPY.

The negro in the South, as in the
North, is persecuted. and worse than
persecuted, here and there. He does
not here and there receive the rights to
which he is entitled. This fact is a
hawling discredit to American civiliza-
tion, But to picture the negroes of the
South as a sullen, hunted, despairing
race is to picture what does not exist.—

‘ashville Advocate.

“NO ENEMIES.”

You have no enemies, you say?

Alas, my friend, that boast is poor.
He, who has mingled in the fray

Of duty that the brave endure,

Must have made foes! If you have none
Small is the work that you have done.
You've hit no traitor on the hip,
You've dashed no cup from perjured lip
You've never turned wrong to right;
You've been a coward in the fight.
