The 1973-74 edition of Quips ‘and
Cranks was not distributed last Thur-
sday because of what has come to
be called an act of censorship. While

Yearbook Editor Jeff e had
scheduled the distribution of an-
nual tor Thursday, Oct. 17. The
books were to be delivered late Wed-
nesday. George claims the book was
“all ready to go”’ right up to Tuesday

On Tuesday, unknown to George, a

company called College Business
Manager Robert A. Currie. He
inquired of Currie Davidson’s
desires about printing George’s.

yearbook.

“Nobody questioned me,” George
said. ‘I had no idea that there was
any. problem whatsoever.” (It was
explained to Currie that the book con-
tained ‘‘questionable’’ material.
Currie was to be in Charlotte on
business Wednesday anyway, and it
was decided that he would pick up.a
copy of the parts in question before a
decision was made on the book’s

It is unclear why the publisher con-
tacted Currie. Under Davidson’s
system of “funding ~ student
organizations, all activities’ money
is collected by the college through the
activities fee in the comprehensive
fee payment.

Once the money is collected (ac-
tually in the spring before the collec-
tion) the campus tax council meets to
appropriate the activities money.
Beginning July 1, officers of the
various organizations are authorized
to spend the allocations.

In order to receive the funds ap-
propriated, each organization must
submit vouchers or bills to the
college comptroller’s office. Checks
are issued twice weekly, signed by
Business Manager Currie.

- This system by which Currie has to
sign all checks, led George to bring
him in as a-co-signer on the contract.

It is George’s belief that this is why
Currie was called by the publisher.

While some organizations funded
by campus tax get both activities and
college-produced fees, Quips. and
Cranks is run solely on student fees.
Each 1973-74 Davidson student has
thus already paid for his book.

When Currie returned to the

college with the pages of the year-
book the publisher deemed
questionable the matter.was then
taken from his hands. That Wed-
nesday was college conference day,
and Dean of Students Will Terry
claims to have been too busy in that
venture to have had any import on
the decisions of that day.

Informed sources disagree as to
the extent of Terry’s involvement,
but it is agreed upon that Academic
Vice-President John M. Beven, possi-
bly in concert with Terry and College
President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
made the decision that the es in’
question should’ not be part of

nual.

Currie informed the publishing
company that this decision had been
made; and that he would issue no
check for the remainder of the money
due. The books were all printed,
laying at the print shop, unbound.
They remain there today. .

On Thursday, George called the
publishing company to find out where
the books were. At this time the
publisher informed him of the
college’s move in censoring the an-
nual.

Thursday

afternoen student

-inquirers were told by Dean Terry’s

office that the books were not in.
Terry’s secretary (accurately ac-
cording to Terry) disclaimed any
knowledge of the book’s whereabouts
and sent questioning students to
Currie’s office. Terry himself saw a
copy of the pages and knew’ of the
decision by at the latest Thursday

morning.

- Anumber of students have claimed
that they were deliberately misled by
the dean’s officé. While Terry denies
this, George claims he was told by
the dean that Terry was purposefully
not giving students the information
on the books’ situation. :

By Friday, it was becoming fairly
well known on campus that the books
were under some form of censorship.

captions; one quoting the lead line of

a DAVIDSONIAN editorial, the other

using a four letter word for
tion.

On Friday noon, Gein and SGA.
President Blain Butner met with
Spencer. They were told that the cen-
sorship was his decision and that the
“questionable material” could not be
used in the book.

“We discussed and offered com-
promise,’ Butner and George
agreed, “‘but the president indicated
that he would not compromise. He in-
formed us that we could appeal his
decision to the Board of Trustees.”’

On Sunday night at 11 p.m. student
representatives of campus
organizations met in the SGA office
to discuss: the administration’s
decision. It was decided to appeal to
the trustees, and if necessary to go to
court. S ( :

It was at this meeting that the let-
ter to the college community, the
SGA resolution and the campus-wide
petitions were discussed and set in
motion. In addition, posters were put
up publicizing the issue.

On Monday, Spencer received a let-
ter from ining his desire
to appeal the decision to the trustces.
Ata luncheon meeting with represen-
tative students Spencer explained
that the issue would come before the

“After the to the trustees,

said WDAV News Director Scott
Reid. “‘If not, we will go to court.”’
Numerous nafional student
organization representatives have
been contacted, according to Butner,
and all are interested in helping. ‘‘It
seems us though a lot of people are
conrerned over a private college’s
laim to censorship powers,”’ he said.

The Charlotte law firms of Blum.

and Shezly and George Daly have
also been contacted. If the appeal to
the trustees fails, students say they
are prepared to go to the Charlotte
newspapers and to court. f

An attorney contacted unofficially
by one student representative claims
that the case is clearly in favor of the
students in any merit charges of ob-
scenity. He sees only a jurisdictionat
question, though he points out that
the state constitution clearly states
that “‘there can be no interference
with freedom of the press.”

With the issue now passed through
official groups such as the SGA and
unofficial student greups, and ruled
upon by the president, the’ next move
is up to the Board of Trustees.
