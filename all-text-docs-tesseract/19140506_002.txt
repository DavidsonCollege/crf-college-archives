NEXT YEAR'S FRESHMEN.

The men of the three classes who re-
turn next year are naturally interested
in.the students who will enter next fall.
There is alwavs speculation beforehand
as to the personnel, size and character of
the coming Freshman class. Yet very
few of us realize as we ought the im-
portance of this class. . Not in their own
eves—all discouragement to that—but in
view of their coming development into
the Seniors and ‘leaders of Davidson,
In four vears the class of #918 will be
filling a large majority of -the important
offices in the student body. Its men
will be the men of most influence’ in
every activity.

President Martin has struck a keynote
to the success of Davidson when he has
been urging the men of cach State to do
all in their power to induce prospective
college students to come to Davidson.
Too manv leave this to letters and cata-
logues. In and around every. student's
home are men who with persuasion and
encouragement would come to David-
son next fall. . an

Davidson needs strong men. She needs
mature men. She deeds athletic talent,
literary talent. Eyerv man can be a.
canvasser this sugnmer. Bring the
Freshmen in with vou ‘next fall to make
the best class—ves, better than vour own
—that Davidson has had vet.

A column of this issue has been de-
voted to the work of the Civic League.
Tt has done and is doing much for the
community. Its members are wide-awake
and active in their efforts, and deserve
the heartiest of support. Read the article
and help the League.

The Student’ Council elections last
week have placed on the Council for
next vear a sect of strong, faithful men.
We congratulate them on their honor
and the classes on their choice.

The base ball game with South Caro-
lina Thursday is the last of game of the
season. We can come in on the ‘home
stretch if we will. Det’s make the pep
tomorrow afternoon the greatest vet.

DAVIDSON DEFEATS LENOIR.

Tn a father loose and unexciting game:
Davidson walloped Lenoir College to
the tune of 8 to 7. Osteen was on the

mound for the’ Varsity, while Plvler
‘twirled for the visitors,
Davidson scored two in the third,

three in the fifth, and three more in the
seventh. almost every run being regis-
tered by a clean hit. The visitors
score one in the first. after two errors

were made. In the third. after a three-
bageer ‘bv Conrad. he was scored on a
single. In the last frame, after an error

by Keesler, two hits scored one miore
run. The onlv feature of the game was
athe hitting of Stough. who secured two
triples during the game, and in the ninth
Somerville made a pretty catch of a
liner.

These departments work more or less
independently, although the whole club
must pass on disbursements and on new
undertakings. .

Perhaps the most important branch of
any Civic Club’s work is that which
comes under the head wf “Streets and
Sanitation.” Our League has a strong
committee of ladies in this department,
and thev have a wide field of activity in
Davidson. Every one is looking to them
with expectancy to see what measures
thev will propose to meet the present
ust problem. The long dry spell and
he increase of automobile traffic render
e situation worse than usual at this

and ietenly for us who live here to sav
how long we will endure the clouds of
dust rising, germ-laden, from the dirty
streets,,to come up on our verandas, to
enter our windows, and even to settle
on our dishes and food. The prevalence
of “dust colds,” with all their discom-
forts and dangers, proves what a menace
to health dusty streets are to adults and
children.

It has been proposed that the, ladies of
this department make overtures to the
automobile owners—now a goodly and
ever-increasing [number of our most
progressive citizens. Naturally the auto
driver suffers as much as any one else
from the dust which his and his friend’s
machine stirs up, and these gentlemen
would be most anxious to relieve the
situation, and to allow themselves and
their companions to be seen in all their
splendor, as they shoot by rather than
to he half-concealed by a yellow cloud
that is not becoming to any complexion.

We hope a plan for oiling: the streets
within the town limits will soon be pro-
posed, considered and adopted.

Another active department of the lo-
cal League is that concerned with
“School Improvement.” After spending
money in various ways at the school, this
committee was earnestly entreated bv the
teachers emploved there to take steps
toward providing .a small working
library for the school.

It has been proved over and over that
the teacher who uses the most. books is
the most interesting teacher, and that the
pupil who reads the most is found at the
head of his class. and that the best pu-
pils make, the best citizens—so this was

evidently a civic undertaking.
In fact ‘the need of books for r

treasurv. Dr. Lingle gave the proceeds
of a “Travel Talk.” then the. commit-
tee issued a circular letter.explaining the
movement arid followed it up ith a
personal canvass of the town by disticts.
The result of the first two week's solicit-
ing was made known Saturday when the
committee met.

A table heaped with books made the
library begin to look like a reality. -These
volumes have all been carefully selected
for the purpose and form a valuable
nucleus for the librarv. .

Among these books already collected
are noticeable nine volumes from, Dr.
Shearer’s shelves. three of these being a
handsome calf-skin edition of “Ridnath’s
History of the World; Mrs. Foster
contributed a Student’s Cvclopedia, in

Fairy Tales,” Every Child Should
Know, and a good collection of Amer-
ican Poems; Mrs. Brady a set of five
volumes of “Stories,” and Mrs. W. R.
Grey. “Greene's History of the English
People.”

A number of other people ‘have prom- |

ised books, and it is verv probable that
some students have books encumbering
their shelves which they would be glad
