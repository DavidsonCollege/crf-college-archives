of the Week

that

Since the danger Russia,

Italy, and Japan will enter the war
on the side of Germany has grown
more acute, the possibility that the
United States will be pulled into a

world conflict

larged. Therefore the following

question is of vital interest to the
College Student. “In case of an
‘Allied’ reversal in Europe, Should
the United States enter the war to
aid England and: France?”

Jack Abernathy — Senior: “In

all my innocence and lack of knowl-
edge of the question, I should say
no, It is difficult for a new college

student to answer the question

which puzzles the minds of even the
most brilliant

best informed and

statesman -of -our—country,_How-

ever, in the event that the so-called
“Allies” should suffer defeat, the
United States should keep its own
skirts clear of
that will shove us into the full hor-
rors*of war. In the event of actual

attack on this country, my opinion
entirely re-

any entanglement

would, of course, be
versed,”

Daniel Gilliam—Senior: “I feel
that the United—States has a vital
interest in who wins this war. The
allies are fighting as much to pre-
serve democratic ideals as ‘well
as their own interests. Should not
America also help to preserve these
ideals? It ‘is. possible for the al-
lies to go Facist if they lose and
this would boost this idea in Amer-
this totalitarian -phil-

would in

ica, since

osophy have succeded
capturing two of the large democra-
cies. If we believe democracy
we should help England and France

even for men.”

to me that it is just as necessary
to the United Statés to have a
friendly power in England and
_France as it is to Britain to have
a friendly power in Relgium and
the Netherlands. If the British and
French continue the fight tothe end
as they say they will and are con-
quered by Germany, the. first line
of American defense will be broken,
with the .British navy no longer
controlling the seas. With the in-
creased resources then in his power,
Hitler an excellent
position.to make inroads, _ideologi-
cally at least, into the South Amer-
ican countries. The great increase
of prestige of the Facist philosophy,
as a result of the visible evidences
of policy attract the
South and Central -American_na-
tions and would be a very definite
threat to our own ideals of liberty
and freedom. Consequently I think
the United States should do its best
to keep. England and France at
least equal in power to the Facist
combination.”

In a letter to the alumni last
May Mr. Jackson, treasurer of the
college, wrote, “In connection with
the College’s Centennial Movement,
one alumnus who considered con-
tributing $2,500 decided that he
could ‘not safely make so large a

donation at this time. Instead he
decided to give for an indefinite
time, 4% of this sum each year,

which is $100. He suggested at the
same time that we start.a “Century
Club,” seeking to get one hundred
persons to give $100 a year to the
budget of the College.

“Membership in the ‘Century
Club’ involves far too large an an-
nual gift for many of our alumni,
but the plan gave us an idea that
is adaptable to the size of every
pocketbook. Upon _ investigating
