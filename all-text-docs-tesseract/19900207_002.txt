‘Police officer to talk
about self-defense

For women only please. . .

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

While studying in England, Senior
Sarah Bayne decided that Davidson
needed to provide a method of edu-
cating women about self-protection.
During fall semester she arranged for
Charlotte Police officer Francis Tay-
lor togivea protection seminar. It will
take place Monday, February 19 in
the 900 Room at 7:30pm.

Taylor has presented her pro-
gram, whichincludesa film, demon-
stration and discussion, to various
groups throughout Charlotte. The
program is designed to help women
become more aware of their dan-
gers, and how to protect themselves
against assualt. Taylor asked that
only women attend the seminar be-
cause she learned that men hamper

the discussion of women’s issues. y

WASH & DRY, from page 1

wait for the dryer. Wet laundry piles up
because most students cannot sit on the
dryer for one and a half fours to make
sure they are the next in line.

If sufficient washers and dryers can-
not be provided then the laundry fee
should be optional. Often I do laundry
off campus just to avoid the hassle and
in no way do I come anywhere close to
getting my money’s worth from the
Davidson machines.”

“Aside from losing a sock or two over
the past twoyears, the laundry hasdone
a very satisfactory job.”

“The laundry does an excellent jobon
dress shirts. They come out pressed and
starched. However, other clothes come
out dingy, shrunken, and
wrinkled...Part of growing up is taking
responsibility for yourself and part of
taking responsibility for yourself is
making time for grooming (this in-
cludes doing your laundry!).”

“The only reason I don’t send all my
laundry through the service is because
the dryers sometimes shrink my clothes
- But the dry cleaning is wonderful -
Don’t take away the service!!”

“We are adults! I’d rather save $300
and do the laundry myself!!”

“I think the laundry fee should be
OPTIONAL!”

The laundry fee is $350 per year—
that’s $1,400 over. four years at
Davidson (not counting inflation). Both
amounts of money are substantial to
most people (students and/or parents)
who may want to choose or may need to
use the sum for other purposes. Those
people who said that the laundry serv-
ice was satisfactory also asked that the

laundry fee be made optional.

The two most frequent comments
from students on the survey, in fact,
were requests to make the laundry fee
optional and requests for more ma-
chines.

However, if the laundry fee is made
optional, there is some question as to
whether or not the laundry could sup-
port a smaller demand for its services.

One option could be to havea manda-
tory laundry fee that would finance
machines for students to do their own
wash. As one student wrote, “What
about turning the laundry building into
a laundromat with many washers and
dryers for student use?”

The problem with having equipment
in all of the dorms is that there is no
room for them. Another problem is the
cost of that equipment, whether it be in
dorms or a “student laundromat.”

The laundry’s equipment expendi-
tures went from $483 in 1988 to $25,206
in 1989. Translated that means that the
laundry purchased new _ industrial
strength machinery. The need lies-in
how tomake the process of having clean
clothes to wear an efficient one and one
which students have a partin determin-
ing.

The SGA is trying to help meet that
need by continuing their investigation
of the laundry service along with the
other facilities falling under the cate-
gory of auxiliary services, including the
bookstore, food service, the Union cafe
and the guest house.

The SGA’s further study will be car-
ried out bya committee which is soon to
beestablished. Its members willinclude
four students, two faculty members
Vice President for Business and Financ
Bob Sutton and Director of Auxiliar
Services Carleton Pritchard. Applica
tions for nominations of students wish
ing to serve on the committee will b
available the first week in March.

Many thanks to Sidney Summers for hel,
