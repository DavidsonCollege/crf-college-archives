Gull’s Nest

He's back,
and he's got
another list.

Lanrnotin the habicoe issuing the
obligatory Freshman welcome, and
between checking in my fellows
(incidentally, 2nd Little is the best
hall on campus) and setting up
Howdie’s den of love, I haven’t
had too much time to think of a
topic.

I am, however, going to give
you new folks some needed infor-
mation in the form of one of my
columns from last year. As some
(one) returning students will re-
call, I listed popular movie titles
and tied them to Davidson experi-
ences and people. Here are some
more.

1. Cannonball Run—The rush to
the bathroom after lunch at the
Commons.

2. Reality Bites—The freshmen
guys’ feeling when the upperclass-
men come back to steal their
women.

3. Spanking the Monkey—Post-:
Reality Bites syndrome.
4. It's a Wonderful Life—My first
class is at ten.

5. A Few Good Men—2nd Little.
6. A Perfect World—Whatit would

be if everyone stopped ridiculing |

me. ttehe avin
Counselors.

8. True Lies—‘Yeah, I broke up
with her before I came to school.”
9. Spies Like Us—An RA job
description.

10. Puttin’ on the Ritz—What I’m
doing when I don my green “resi-
dential staff’ polo shirt.

Also, let me just make one
brief comment about Kindred, the
book the freshmen read (!?) over
the summer. It is actually a fine
book, with an interesting plot, and
it is “hard to put down.”

However, haven’t we all had
enough of this multi-cultural har-
mony stuff?

We’ ve all been invited to at-
tend Davidson, and it, unlike many
other schools, takes character into
account in the application process.
We already respect cultural differ-
ences. -_

~ And even if we didn’t, why
would a tedious grabfest turn a
devout racist into Mother Theresa?
It wouldn’t; only personal experi-
ence breaks barriers of ignorance.
And reading a science fiction book
about slavery and time travel sare
isn’t going to do the job.

If we do decide to make Fresh-
men read a book, why not let it be
representative of Davidson’s mis-
sion as an institution? How about
a book extolling the virtues of be-
ing honest and not phony like A

Prayer for Owen Meany by John’

Irving?
If we do, however, feel that

our eventual-and most important —

goal as an institution is simply to
graduate sensitive ‘people, we’ve
chosen an okay book, but we’re
aiming too low as a college. °

THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, AUGUST 29, 1994 9

Above and beyond the law

I just couldn’ t start a year without
griping about Davidson’s alcohol
policy. I just figured we would go
ahead and get it out of our system
now to make room for other things
to put into our system, like beer.
The problem arises from the new
“same rules, new enforcement”
policy thatseems to be the college’s
new stance.

I understand the need to en-
force North Carolina law and keep
the school’s exposure to insurance
problems at a minimal level.

Alas, no, our gripe is not with
the legislation necessitating this
policy, or with the college for en-
forcing it. It is with (1) the way
RA’s and hall counselors are ex-
pected to enforce the policy on
their fellow students and (2) with
the way persons of legal drinking
age are treated but the policy be-
‘yond North Carolina’s laws.

First, RA’s and hall counse-
lors, conscientious people who take
on responsibility for the good of
their school, are asked to do too
much when they ate given no lee-
way in dealing with drinking in the
residence halls or in the senior
apartments. They are students too,
and should not be threatened with
losing their jobs if they let their
classmates go with a warning.

I have even heard from un-
named RA’s that they would not
have choosen the job if they had
been told before their retreat that
they would be required to perform
this duty upon theirreturn to school.

Other RA’s have commented
that they wonder who will be will-
ing to take on this duty next year

knowing what the job is to require.

Second, those who are old
enough to drink can be slapped
with an alcohol violation, not only
for drunkenness or driving under
the influence, but for carrying al-
coholic beverages outside of des-
ignated drinking areas.

Here, the college must feel
that the state laws are not stringent
enough. Davidson has created its
own law so that even a 21-year-old
can’t walk across campus with an
exposed,. unopened bottle of
whisky or a case of beer. Police
and RA’s must give violations to
everyone carrying alcohol outside
of the assigned areas. This is to
include beer or wine in plastic gro-
cery bags where it is still some-

what visible.

The basis for this rule is that if
an RA should see the beer or wine
through the bag and still look the
other way, the RA would be par-
tially to blame if the beer or wine
caused someone to drive drunk,
etc. This is pushing contributory
negligence to an extreme.

' This aspect of the policy is
absurd because it deprives people
of rights given to them by North
Carolina state law and makes for
obvious logistical problems with
transporting alcohol from a car to
the apartments or the dorms.

Please, let’s reconsider these
two excesses of the alcohol policy
and help our students respect the
law without being antagonized by
its enforcers, Otherwise beware—
because Big Brother is watching.

BUSBA TUNIOR

Skivey SENIOR

us: from the outside in

I begin this article with the ques-
tion I’ve been bombarded with
during the last few days. I spent
my summer disguised as Mega-
Tourist carrying around my trusty
backpack and camera seeing ev-
erything one can imagine in that
continent across the pond.

Now, I am back to complete
my final tour of duty at Davidson.
A couple of nights ago, I had a rare
semi-coherent discussion at the
new apartments, that glowing nurs-
ing-home-space-ship down thehill,
and I faced.some of the thoughts
and fears concerning the everloom-
ing question, “what’s going to hap-
pen after graduation.”

No, I didn’t discover any an-
swers that I can pass on to you, nor
did I really come any closer to
understanding things for myself.

The only thing I can offer to
you is some advice right now.
Seniors and under-class men and
women, take it or toss it aside. I
don’t care.

- This summer, I was in Lon-

don studying theater, and as many
who go abroad for any period of
time, I realized something very
important.

One: I traveled a lot and saw
all of this old stuff which will make
me sound oh-so-posh at future din-
ner parties.

Two: I learned what it means
to be an American once I got out.
You look at your life, family, food,
beer, TV, everything in some new
and strange way. You see from the

outside in.
Three (and this was the

_ Shocker): I experienced the neces-

sary disillusionment of knowing
that there are hundreds of people
who are as intelligent and talented
as myself and who have focused
their lives and accomplished much
more than I could ever dream of.
I'm not trying to pity myself, but
this is going to give me the needed
second wind that will carry me to
the graduating finish line.

Look from the inside out, but
occasionally switch perspective
and see yourself from the outside.
We are receiving some of the best
liberal arts education in the coun-
try. It is liberal in the sense of the
scope of studying provided by our
professors, but it is time, espe-

cially for seniors, to sharpen the ©

angles of generality and, to use a
phrase I hate, of our “well-rounded”
personality and knowledge.

It’s funny. I often wish I were
Pre-Med or Pre-Law just because
that would give me a concrete goal
to aim everything toward. Like
many of you, I really have no idea
where I will be. Possibly, you

’ mightsee mein the following years

raising chickens in Montana or kill-
ing wild boar with my teeth in
South America.

Whatever it is, I need to de-
cide now, because believe it or not,
the world will pass you by. Inher-
iting daddy’s business or receiv-
ing that long awaited trust fund is
not enough. ' Find something--

whether it's chickens or pigs--and
dedicate yourself to it.

I will give you an example: I
saw a play at the English National
Theatre in London directed by a
guy who has directed three other
shows at the National and has pro-
duced four works of his own. He is
one year younger than myself.

Twenty yearsold! OK, I guess -

that makes me left-over pot roast
in the grand scheme of things.

Although doubt causes me to be“

harsh on myself, I know I have thé
potential to do what I want and to
do it successfully. Everyone re-
ceives an amount of absolute po-

tential, and it is our duty to fulfill
what we have been given.

Evil arises when we chose to
ignore our gifts. This director that
‘impressed mein London is no more
gifted than myself, but what he has
done is to sharpen: focus and to
accomplish his goals.

Seniors, this year should not
be completely coated in Budweiser,
but save time to catch up with a
world that turns at a faster speed
than the confines of Davidson.

I won’t end this with cool
slang and a catchy phrase, but I
shall leave you with a simple wish
of luck.
