PHYSICS HONORARY
HOLDS FIRST MEETING

Sigma Pi Sigma, Physies honor
society held its first meeting in
the Blue Room, of the College
Union. President Jerry ‘Pietenpol
reported on his research in the
geochemistry lab operated in
Palisades, N. Y., by Columbia Uni-
versity. \

His work dealt primarily with

the carbon 14 method of geologi-
eal dating. This technique involves
determining the ratio of carbon 14
(radioactive) to carbon 12 (ordi-
nary) m various geological sam-
ples, by counting the radioactivity.

After the report was given, the
group discussed the principles as-
sociated with the procedure and
apparatus.

At the end of the meeting, plans
were made for a future discussion
of graduate study in physics at
various schools.

$10,000 Yearly Salary
Possible for Faculty

A $10,000 a year average salary
for college faculty members is
possible if teachers are willing to
utilize time effectively and experi-
ment with new methods, according
to President W. Bay Irvine of
Marietta College.

“Larger classes, mass communi-
cation and other devices could be
employed to make fewer instruc-
tors necessary, thus easing teacher
shortages and providing more
money for salaries,” Dr, Irvine
said.

Quality of instruction can re.
main just as high. he declared.
“Why can't a student learn just
as well in a class of 20 as in a
class of 157” “We in education
would do well to copy industry's
plan of reducing the unit cost.
increasing the quality of the pro-
duct (student) and better reward-
ing the operator (teacher).”

President Irvine also suggested
elimination of specialized classes
offered to a small number of stu-
dents as a means of better utilizing
faculty time. “It’s up to us,” Dr.
Irvine declared. “We can continue
“under the traditional ‘vow of
poverty’ or we can experiment
with new methods that promise
help in lifting our salary standards
to a respectable level.”

also be present at the inter-disci-
plinary sociology seminar, conduc-
ted by Dr. Ford and Dr. McAfee,
associate professor of Sociology.

Other activities are planned by
the “Y" for Political Emphasis
Week. Dr. Ford will speak at
Chapel on Tuesday concerning the
idea of religious ethics in politics.
Wednesday night hall prayer meet-
ings will similarly be centered
around this theme.

The “Y” Committee on Effective
Citizenship has expressed its hope
that the week, which it has plan-
ned for Davidson students, will
be beneficial to them as politics
becomes “red hot” in the few
weeks preceding national elections.

_ LANGUAGE NEEDS

A thorough knowledge of the
fundamentals of the English lang-
uage is an essential requisite, for
the doctor who cannot communi-
cate effectively with those with
whom he must deal cannot hope to
practice medicine as he should.

The student should also have
some knowledge of foreign langu-
ages, economics, history, psycholo-
gy, and other liberal arts courses
to be adequately prepared for the
study of medicine.

SPIRITUAL FACTOR

The second major aspect of un-
dergraduate preparation is spirit-
ual preparation. Much of the prac-
tice of medicine depends on the in-
tegrity and moral character of the
physician. If an individual physi-
cian does not measure up to the
trust that the public places in him,
he will not be a good physician.
