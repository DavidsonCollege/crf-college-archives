The Davidson. women’s tennis team con-
tinued its incredible streak of dominance
Saturday by recording 7-0 victories over
Wingate and Queens, the third and fourth
consecutive times the team succeeded in
sweeping its competition.

The Wingate match posed no challenge for
Davidson, as the top five Wildcat players
(Kelsey Linville ’08, Michelle Fanney ’09,
Teresa Wang ’10, Laura Dushanova ’09 and
Samantha Galainena ’11) won their matches
without dropping a game, each by the score
of 6-0, 6-0. Sixth-seeded Emily Wilkinson
completed the singles sweep with a 6-0, 6-2
triumph.

victories in doubles, all by the perfect score
of 8-0.

victory in doubles against Queens, while

Kim Whelan ’08 and Skeeters combined for

an 8-0 decision. Queens forfeited the third

top two singles slots, with scores of 6-0, 6-1
and 6-1, 6-2, respectively. Skeeters,

The wrestling team once again produced
a few solid individual performances, but the
team could not string together enough victo-
ries for the win, losing to The Citadel in
Charleston 31-6.

Vitaly Radsky ’11 earned a hard-fought
6-2 decision against The Citadel’s Mike
Fenton at 141 pounds early in the day, but
the Bulldogs won the next three matches to

extend their lead to 18-3. This early advan-.

tage proved decisive.

News and Notes

Appalachain State has won four of their
last five games, overtaking Chattanooga for
first place in the North Division. The
Mountaineers are one of the hottest teams
in the league, winning their last 13 of 16
after a 3-5 start.

The Citadel remains winless in SoCon
play after a heart-breaking 75-71 overtime
lost at Appalachain State on Saturday.

Davidson can clinch the South Division
title with a win or a Georgia Southern loss.

The Southern Conference Tournament is
set for Mar. 7-10 in Charleston, S.C.

Despite the team’s struggles, Trebor
Clavette ’08 continued his excellent season
by tallying a 9-8 decision over Derek Sickel
at 174 pounds to close the deficit to 18-6,
but this victory would be the last scoring of
the day for Davidson.

This defeat brings the Wildcats’ record
down to a disappointing 1-11 overall, and
they finish the conference schedule with a
winless 0-5 mark.

The Wildcats return home on Feb. 16 at 7
p.m. where they will host two rival schools,
Campbell and Anderson, in a tri-meet event.
This meet will be the second to last home
meet of the year before the SoCon
Championships in Chattanooga, Tennessee
on Mar. 8.
