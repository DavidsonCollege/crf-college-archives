Hungary, Oct. 3—(IP)—
Protests on the part of middle-class Hun-
garians who desire to send their children
to college has caused the Hungarian gov-
ernment to begin to retreat from its pol-
icy of reducing the college enrollment by
30 per cent this year.

Following the criticism of his plan to
cut down the number of new students, on
the ground that Hungary already had too
many “intellectuals” out of work, Count
Kuna Klebelsburg, Minister of Educa-
tion, is now reported to have doubled the
number to be admitted to the Law School
of the University of Budapest. Negotia-
tions are under way, also, for increasing
the number of general students, regard-
less of the Klebelsburg “reduction” edict
of last July.

solemnized during the summer month

of limited space, and readers will have
