now.”

The two top SGA positions .

were captured in a run-off
with a record turnout of stu-
dents at the polls. President-
elect Clodfelter drew 70%
of the votes over Cecil Bur-
ney after the five-way race
narrowed down on the first
ballot the day before. Ed.
munds edged out Bill Alex.
ander by eight votes for vice-
president.

Clodfelter was pleased with
the attention which students
gave to the campaign this
year. “I ‘was really glad
that a couple of issues got
brought out. This would not
have happened if the com-
petition had not been so
tense.’’

He atided that he) hopes
the SGA can become ‘‘more
action - oriented and respon-
Sive to the needs of the stu-
dents.”

Edmunds wants to revamp
the structure of the Resi-
dence Hall Council (RHC).
“I. think we need to change
the RHC so as to replace
the present representatives
with the senators.” He feels
that this innovation will
“streamline the activities of
the RHC.

Adrian Long was unoppos-
ed for the presidency of the
YMCA, as was Paul Yar-
brough for the treasury.
Long wants to improve the
off-campus status of the or-
ganization.

“A new project is to ex-
pand the deputations and
STEP programs. We are
working for a youth, center
for junior and senior high
students to provide jobs and
pre-college counseling.”

One other function of the
new youth center would be
lo set up inter-church youth
fellowship group meetings in
the area. Long added, ‘We
also are trying to arrange
a service information center
on the draft.”

In .the election for vice-

ly Tinsley was the winner.

mer.

More than 700 voters went
to the polls Tuesday, and the
run-off drew over 500 voters
again, which is the usual
number for the first ballot
in past elections.

Computer operator Tom
Vernon attributed part of
the turnout to the extra poll-
ing booth in the post office
on Tuesday.

“It would be a good place
to go for students who never
make it fo Chambers be-
cause of classes in other
buildings, and by keeping
lists of names separate polls
would still be safe from
multiple voting.”

Election returns were de-
layed Wednesday afternoon
for over a half an hour be
cause a decision had to be
made:concerning the possi-
bility of a recount.

According to Vernon a list
of names was not kept for
the run-off, leaving no way
to validate actual counts.
Considering the close vote of
an election, any. candidate
may call for a recount with-
in two weeks after the bal-
loting. Since’ no recount can
be made for the runoff,
Vernon said that a candi-
daté “may then call, for
another election to clear .up
the doubt.

ODK Raps Faculty Policy

By RICH WILSON:
Asst. Managing Editor
Senior members of Omi-

cron Delta Kappa (ODK), a
leadership fraternity, walk-
ed into Tuesday’s faculty
meeting before it convened
and read a statement pro-
testing faculty unwillingness

oto open their. meetings to

students.

“We, the senior members
of Omicron Delta Kappa,
are here today to demon-
strate our opposition to meet-
ings of the faculty which are
not open to all segments of
this college community,”
read the statement.

‘We feel that such a policy
of governance. denies_ pro-
per . representation and ob-
structs effective communi-
cation. Your meeting today
demonstrates’ these concerns
on your part. We too would
like to discuss. this problem
but we will leave’ if asked.”
The students * retired ‘from
the room...

After » the meeting es
convened, the faculty passed
a motion stating that. the
current meeting was rather

long but that they. would be
glad to schedule a discus-
sion with the ODK seniors at
a subsequent. meeting - when
this idea could be dacketed
as a regular matter of bus-

iness, accdrding to. Samuel
R. Spencer Jr., college pre-
sident:

Members of ODK said

that they specifically chose
Tuesday’s meeting for their
demonstration, since the fac-
ulty agenda included discus-
sion concerning faculty con-
sultation on administrative
appointments.

“Since ‘the faculty was
asking the administration to
be consulted, we decided this
would -be a good time for
students to ask the faculty
to be consulted,” said Ran
Coble.

Those students who parti-
cipated in the demonstration
were John Bollinger, John
Brunner, Gary Cash, Herb
Clegg, Richard Cowart, Ed
Dobbs, Gene Early, Peter
Lutkin, -Tom Opie, Alan
Peterson, ° Cullum Rogers,
and Jimmy Trussell.

Seniors Gray Ma§6n and

Greg Scott did not
cipate,

In other action, the fac-
ulty passed a resolution ex-
pressing its dissatisfaction
with what it felt to be inade-

parti-

' quate faculty participation

in the process of administra-
tive appointments, accord-
ing to Spencer.

The motion also stated
that the objections and dis-
