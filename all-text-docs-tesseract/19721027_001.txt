Blacks Get Sympathy,
Few Pledges Of Action

By MARK DEATON
Staff Writer

The Black Student Coalition
received a sympathetic
response from faculty and
administration this week but
few promises of action on their
10 grievances concerning the
condition of blacks at Davidson.

While most agreed that
Davidson had not been doing as
much as it could in recruiting
black students, several
questioned the feasibility of the
black’s demands for 150 blacks
by next year.

“T think recruiting 150 black
students in two years would be
an unrealistic goal considering
our past experience and the
past experience of other
colleges similar to Davidson,”
said College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr.

Despite the criticisms of
blacks, Spencer said that the
college has made _ some
progress in improving black
conditions here, ‘‘but certainly
not spectacular progress,’’ he
said.

“We need more blacks in our
faculty, in our professional staff
and ‘in our student body,"
admitted Spencer. “We also
need more recognition in
education of the contributions of
blacks.

With regard for the black's
demand for more black faculty,
Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan noted
the fierce competition for
competent black faculty across

the country.
Bevan cited such factors as
Davidson's southeastern

location, rural setting and all
white pr ional community

as deterrants to hiring black

professors.

“I refuse to throw salary
limits way out of line to attract
any professor,’’ Bevan said. ‘‘I
won't go out and buy people.’

Although the blacks
demanded a Black Studies
Program, several members of
the Faculty Executive
Committee (FEC) which met
with the blacks questioned the
need for such a program.

‘‘Whether or not we have the
resources of interest for such a
program is debatable,’ said
Professor of Psychology John
Kelton.

‘I don't have any objections
to an African Studies Program,
but I believe that Black studies
should be incorporated in
history, government,
psychology, sociology, drama,
music and political science
within our present course
structure rather than as a
separate program,”’ Kelton
said.

Slater Offers Alternate

Asst. Managing Editor

After a meeting between
students and ARA Food Service
representatives on Wednesday,
Oct. 12, an alternate board plan,
a twenty meal per week
program, has been offered and
is now being used by a number
of students.

The decision for’ the
inauguration of the new plan
came_ after considerable

criticism of the prices of food at
Davidson. However, the num-

Proctor admitted, “I'm really
not enthusiastic about an
African Studies Program at this
time. We already have under
way a South Asia Program, and
I don't think we should
jeopardize the success of that.
‘I think the value of
such a ‘Black Studies Program’
could be achieved without a
separate department, a
separate major, a_ separate
formal program,” Proctor said.
Dean of Students Will Terry,
in reference to black demands
for a- better social life, said that
the recruitment of black coeds
was essential in finding a
solution to this problem.
Concerning black demand for
a more complete collection of
books relating to blacks, Bevan
said that a survey of such books
has been completed and that
Proctor was currently making a
list of books which Davidson
should purchase.
Bevan also said he is now
exploring the possibility of

ber of enlistees for the new plan
so far has only been a fraction
of the number of students who
expressed dissatisfaction a few
weeks ago.

Out of 486 students eating at
the Slater houses, only 45 or
about 9 percent have selected
the 20 meal plan, whereas,
more than 75 percent expressed
dissatisfaction with ARA in a
recent student survey con-
cerning the food service.

According to Food Service
Director Ron Scott, the reason
for this meager turnout is that
most students feel that the
limitations of the 20 meal plan
outweigh its advantages.

“These limitations would
cause the student to lose both
variety and flexibility and
overall, we feel that we're
pleasing the majority of the
Students: this is why so many
stayed with the Dining Club
plan," Scott said.

The limitations of the 20 meal
plan that Scott spoke of are the
loss of unclaimed meals.
specified eating hours. a fixed
allowance per meal (except at
Rusk House). and the inability
to feed others (e.g. dates) on
one’s meal ticket.

Scott added that those studen-
ts who stayed with the Dining
Club plan have apparently
begun to eat less at Slater than
at the beginning of the term,
subsidizing their meals more
out of their own pockets on a
day-to-day basis.

“As the vear goes on, the
students’ eating habits will fit
the Dining Club plan more
readily, as they take more and
more meals off campus.

‘Roth. Hatties and Deals do
their best business at the end of
each academic year.” Scott
said.

When asked about the par-
ticipation so far of those in the
20 meal plan, Scott said that it
was nearly 96 percent and that
most of those involved were

upperclassmen.

Under the new plan, the
student is able to take all of his
meals at Rusk with exception of
the Saturday evening meal
which is not included in the

plan.
Scott also pointed out that the
two present meal plans

represent two extremes in
dining alternatives and that
next year a third, ‘middle of
the road, plan will be in-
troduced which would consist of
the meal tickets, and adjusted
prices depending on the number
of meals claimed per week.

When asked his opinion about
the present changes in the
board plan, Vice President for
Finance and Development, C.
David Cornell expressed his ap-
proval of both the new situation
and the way in which the
original problem was handled.

“The basic problem was one
of communication. We didn't
explain the Dining Club plan
thoroughly enough, even though
we felt that it is a good and
workable one. The fault for the
misunderstanding should be
shared jointly by ARA. and the
college .** Cornell said.

Transfer Changes |

By LARRY MIMMS
Staff Writer

Davidson College is more
accesible to women transfer
Students after abandoning a
policy not to accept transfers
from other schools in the Eight
College Exchange program.

To help redefine Davidson's
position in the Consortium,
Director of the Eight College
Exchange Program, Dr. Jay J.
Ostwalt attended a meeting
with otner college
representatives at Randolph-
Macon College last week.

The group decided that those
freshman or sophomore
students at any of the other
seven colleges may transfer to
Davidson, but they must meet
Davidson admission
requirements just as a transfer
from any other college, said
Ostwalt. Davidson had agreed
last spring not to accept any
transfers from the seven other
colleges.

**A woman wishing to come to
Davidson must specify: whether
she wishes to become = an

exchange student under the
eight college admission
program or whether she wishes
to transfer from her college to
Davidson on a permanent basis
and apply through regular
admissions channels; however,
she cannot choose both,”’ stated
Dr. Ostwalt.

He added, ‘This policy in no
way limits transfer decisions by
non-exchange students from
those colleges."

Although the women's
colleges were dissatisfied by
low male __ participation.

representatives agreed that the
Eight College Exchange offered
too many benificial points to be
discontinued, Ostwalt said.

The program offers the
advantage of flexibility in
academic plans and provides a
diverse campus environment.
he noted.

Only thirteen Davidson
students will participate in the
program this vear while 23
female exchange students will
attend Davidson.
