KENNEDY FOR PRESIDEN?

THE DISENTHRALLED

The dogmes of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy
present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must
rise to the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew
and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves. —Abraham Lincoln.

—We ' still have a naval base on
Guantanamo Bay.

—Venezuela hasn't gone complete-
ly over to Communism.

—So our economic growth is slug-
gish—our standard of living is still
‘way above the Soviet level.

—‘You may be ahead of'us in rock-
et thrust, but we're ahead of vou in
color television.” |

America is erving for imaginative
leadership. We need a man who will
think tough and move quickly. who is
disenthralled with a smile and the
status quo.

The man is John Kennedy. He has
dared to criticize a popular president,
the personality poll winner of the
world. He has said that America’s

prestige as the bellwether of free-
dom is on the wane — and Richard
Nixon called his willingness to face

the facts un-American.

He is daring us to make a choice
between complacency and resource-
ful action, between adequate defense
and color television.

The symptom of America’s fading
effectiveness as the spearhead of the

freedom movement is her loss of pres-
tige. John Kennedy has charged that

this country’s prestige is evaporating,
and he has made futile pleas for the
publication of an administration-sup-
pressed poll that would back him up.

To Senator Kennedy, prestige starts
at home, not in the studios of the
Voice of America. The United States
must be number one not only in rock-
etry, but in civil rights, adequate
housing, education, and labor rela-
tions. These issues are Atnerica’s pres-
tige. not “experience,” Catholicism.
wives. or the number-two man on the
ticket.

Kennedy. in most cases, has as-
sumed a firm position on the issues
and has maintained it. Vice President
Nixon has slickly maneuvered, kiss-
ing conservative babies on one side
while shaking liberal hands on the
other. One reads his Harlem speeches
and his Charlotte and Columbia
speeches and wonders if the same
man wrote them (probably didn’t).

But throughout the campaign, Ken-
nedy has refused to equivocate. He
acknowledges that the American stan-
dard of living has risen to the high-
est level the world has ever known,
but he maintains that it has not risen
at the optimum rate. To meet the eco-

nomic challenge of the Soviet Union, we cannot con-
tinue to risk stagnation caused by sluggish fiscal
policies. There is widespread poverty in West Vir-
ginia. Mountain children in the Ozarks are ravaged

by hookworm and rickets. Itinerant fruit pickers
battle to clothe and feed themselves in the lush San

Joaquim valley.

Both candidates favor advances in civil rights. But
which candidate will do something about it? Ken-
nedy’s voting record shows a sincere desire to insure
full citizenship for every American. The man wear-
ing the administrative coattails that Nixon clings to
has consistently bungled civil rights since 1954 sim-
ply by not providing adequate leadership.

Throughout the campaign Nixon
has presented two civil rights plat-
forms—one to the North and a differ-
ent one to the South. Lodge has cam-
paigned in Harlem and Goldwater in

the Carolinas.
Vice President Nixon has charged

that the Kennedy program will
amount to nothing but creeping so-
cialism, a fearful resurrection of the
New Deal.

Senator Kennedy is not trying to
undermine the Protestant Ethic or
to destroy the spirit of capitalism.
He is merely trying to do fot the
people what they can’t do for therh-
selves. Nixon, in a voice ringing with
confidence, cries that the American
People will provide for themselves
through “individual initiative.”

The farmer can initiate until he’s
blue in the face, and where does he
end up? Neck deep in surplus spinach.
John Henry Jones can escape his Nig-
gertown shack by initiating for him-
self. He can get a job on a city gar-
bage truck. People in depressed areas
will stay depressed unless somebody
gives them a new start. Kennedy, not
Nixon, will give it to them.

John Fischer of Harper's lists four
compelling reasons to vote for Ken-
nedy. They are as good as any.

—The next Congress will surely be
Democratic. In the next four years,
America will likely face the worst
crises since Lincoln. We cannot af-
ford a deadlock between the White
House and Congress.

PROF. JAMES G. MARTIN

—Vice President Nixon cannot
easily repudiate the Old Guard, back-
ward-looking policies of the Eisen-
hower administration. Kennedy is in
a better position to act promptly, with
imagination.

—Kennedy is better equipped for
the job. He has shown a broader un-
derstanding of the upheavals now
shaking the world. He realizes that
merely “standing up” to the Rus-
sians just won't do the trick. We must
face them with hardware, infantry
divisions and smart diplomacy.

—Kennedy has more of the moral
fibre necessary for effective leader-
ship in these times. Both men have
hedged on some issues; both have
yielded at times to political expedi-
ency. But Nixon’s record, steeped in
sly. innuendos and McCarthyism,
leads Walter Lippmann to wonder if
he has “within his conscience those
scruples which the country has a right
to expect in the President of the
United States.”

We do not accept John Kennedy
without reservation. We wonder
about his farm policy and we ques-
tion his solution to the Cuban crisis.
But we conclude, with a clear con-
science, that he is the only man who
can give America the leadership that
America desperately needs.

We feel that only Kennedy has the
courage to think tough, to act quick-
ly and imaginatively, to disenthrall
himself and a pot-bellied America.

OUR “ILLITERACY”

“They are restless with their
own illiteracy in. matters of
faith; they know that their in-
tellectual grasp of their formal
jteligious heritage is disreput-
'able and poor. They are not
content that as their intellec-
tual life matures, their religion
should stay adolescent. And
they know even better than
their parents can tell them that
the shapeless life is no more
worth living than the unexam-

very many of our students herehave no faith upon which to

at Davidson. We attend chapelbuild our lives.

That which

and vespers because we havemany of us do have is weak,
to, and we take Bible courses untried, and unused.

because we are required to take
them. But this is as far as it
goes. We are not restless with
our “own illiteracy in matters
of faith.”

Most of the Davidson stu-
dents come from a background
of some type of religious heri-
tage. But rather than try to
see bevond the shallowness of
“Sunday School” religion and
grasp a deeper intellectual
meaning to our faith, we sim-
ply forget about our faith and
allow it to become stagnant. We
let our intellectual life mature,

but our religion stays adoles-
cent.

LACK OF FAITH

It appears to me that we Dav-
idson students are interested
in grades, dating, dressing nice-
ly, and eating good food. Some-
where farther on down the line
of our interests, we may let
religion “slip” in.

It scares me to think. that
many of us Davidson students

General Hester's talk in
Chapel Tuesday on Nutlear
Warfare and Pacifism made me
realize that the world may soon
have another war, and it will
be at times such as this that
we will greatly miss a_ solid
faith in the Supreme Being. '
Perhaps we miss it now!

HONEST DOUBT
This year the YMCA has pub- ;

This article purposes to ad-
vocate the candidacy of Richard
Nixon for’ President of the
United States. With this in
mind, be forewarned that the
arguments advanced will be
presented in such manner as
to indicate that the unbiased,
nonpartisan writer is being
forced by the clarity of his own
logic into the Republican camp.
Be not misled-

He has become premature-
ly conservative and has no
practical choice other than
Mr. Nixon. Unfortunately,
this best available argument
(namely, that of “the lesser
evil’) has already been skill-
fully preempted.

Gettirig down to brass evils:
both principal candidates (in-
cidentally, the “candidate” of
the Socialist Workers’ Party is
North Carolina's own Farrell
Dobbs, not Norman Thomas),
Nixon and Kennedy, have strong
personal appeal. A preference
on this item probably depends
on your position on other mat-
ters.

If you support one you can
develop an abundant and sin-
cere case that the other is a
slick, manipulative, artificial,
organized, tongue-in-cheek poli-
tician. Indeed, the “other” prob-
ably is a highly trained char-
acter actor.

Both aspirants claim Jeffer-
sonian ancestry; neither is Tru-
manian. Any differences of
wealth, clothes, yachts, relig-
ions, homes, wives can be
termed trivia mon consequen-
tia. .. or something. Fortunate-
ly, the hypothetical choice be-
tween pacifist and papist does
not appear to be a real one in
this election; although it might
have proyed an enlightening
test of our bigotry.

Defense? Both are for it;
and for foreign policy as well,
Kennedy must connect Nixon
with Republican fiascos while
alienating him from any suec-
cesses. Nixon must give the
opposite impression: that his
advice was incorporated into
successful ventures, etc.

This is the experience thenie;
it has recently been salted away

our own) easily refutes our ci-
tation for the present. And for
the future? Perhaps not. Per-
haps we shall see.

In genteel agreement with
all preceding commentators:
economic philosophy is the
key area of greatest diverg-
ence. Acknowledge first, how-
ever, that the federal gravy
train is not going to slow
down, and that irregardiess
of the party chosen for Presi-
dent we would appear doomed
for that “outer darkness:
there shall be weeping and
nationalization of teeth.”
The distinction then ‘rests

with whether the recipient is
encouraged to voluntarily help
prepare his own gravy or en-
couraged to let the taxpayers
(sic) do it. Everybody has some
form of health club plan, farm
plan, dole plan, schoolhouse
plan, budget plan.

If the Democrats actually plan
to spend 10 to the 9th dol-
lars more than the Republicans
the two are still equivalent
within a mere 1 per cent error
in fiscal calculation; which re-
calls that old economic maxim:
two quantities are either equal,
or one (or the other) is larger,
or else!

Nevertheless it is in this
realm of economic soothsayings,
promises, heralding and de-
mands that we encounter the
most reliable differences in in-
tention.

There is a definite distinc-
tion between the modestly
unsophisticated proposal to
continue frying to balance
the budget at slightly higher

gravy output while increasing
the incentive for productive
people to be productive, and
the progressive proposal of
the party “for the people” to
raise capital taxes, increase
handouts, and operate at 8
planned rate of fiscal deficit.

Democrat Rose has opinéd
that Republican tight money
leads to higher interest rates,
and, therefore, to higher taxes
and higher prices; while Ken-
nedy’s eminent Harvard Fron-
tiersman, J. K. Galbraith, as-
serts that inflation is actually
a good thing (We simply hand-
out more to those whose sav-
ings are decimated by inflation,
inflate the tariff barrier to
avoid the challenge of nonin-
flating foreign -competition,
handout more to the competi-
tion so they won't resent the ~
tariffi—perennial Santa Claus!).

If their arguments are con-
sistent —- therd remains one
modest proposal for conserva-
tives to initiate their own in-
alienable. “sit-in” movement at
the handout counter and in the
voting booth.
