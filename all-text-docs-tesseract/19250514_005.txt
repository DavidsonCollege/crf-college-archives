It has been announced that Coach Clarence
| Rawson, who has been head of the Freshman |
teams at Davidson for the past two years, |
| will not return next year but will succeed |
| Dick Kirkpatrick as physical director and
‘coach at Charlotte High School. |
Coach Rawson has done much for athletics |
-at Davidson during his stay. He has taken
the raw material of the Freshman class and
has made real varsity material of it in a
creditable way. No one knows the patience
and ability that work of this kind calls for. |
During his first year he turned out a bas- |
ketball team that won many of its games
and two of this team won letters on the var-
sity squad the past season. Four letter men |
of this year’s foothall squad were from the
team put out by Coach Rawson last year.
The team he put out last fall won a notable |
reputation as a contender for the champion- |
ship of the two Carolinas when they met
their only defeat of the year in the final
game. The basketball team of the past sea-|
son made a good showing but seemed to play |

dent Conference chances to test their hill-
climbing abilities as well as get views of
some of the most beautiful mountain scenery

There in the midst of the rugged hills and
along the banks of rock-lined streams the
youth of the South are assembled every year
to get inspiration from’ speakers of note.
from clean life and contact with thoughtful!
young men,

Men going to Blue Ridge find it casy to
get above the clouds of thought as well as
above the clouds which hang around the |
mountain peaks. There they are able to get
above the hazy thinking which so often |
characterize the life of college students.
There every man rubs shoulders with 500 of |
the South’s most progressive and thoughtful
young men, listening to carefully thought
out messages by stimulating leaders.

There surrounding Blu® Ridge within easy
hiking distance are some of the most: famous |
peaks of Eastern America among them being |
Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the
Rockies, Craggy, Greybeard, Turkey Ridge,
and Brushey.
