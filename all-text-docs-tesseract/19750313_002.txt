Change In Exchange Program |

Emphasizes Traveling Abroad

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

Davidson College has partici-

pated in a student exchange

. program with seven colleges in
Virginia. At the end of this
school year, however, Davidson
will modify its part in the ex-
change substantially.

Vice-President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan cited two
major reasons for the change.
Coeducation at Davidson has
limited the number of women
transfer students the college
can enroll.

“What we're faced with is
keeping girls who will be here
for four years out and letting
one-year transfers in,’’ Bevan
explained.

Difficulty in transferring
grades and in evaluating cour-
ses students take at the other
schools has also been a
problem, according to Bevan.

Sometimes a student will take
an insufficient number of cour-
ses to equal a year’s work at
Davidson, and sometimes the
transcripts arrive almost a
month late at Davidson.

“‘We’ve had more than a few
headaches with transferring
credits back here,’’ Bevan con-
cluded.

After this year, Davidson will
exchange students in in-
ternational study programs
with students from the seven
other colleges. For instance,
Davidson students will be able
to participate in Hollin’s study
in Spain program, and Hollin’s
students can enroll ar Marburg
or Montpelier through the
Davidson programs.

Sweetbriar, another par-
ticipant in the exchange
program has an outstanding
Junior Year Abroad program,
according to Bevan.

He said that Sweetbriar’s
Paris program is recognized
across the United States. “‘It’s
the most famous JYA program
in the country, and Sweetbriar
has been running it for a num-
ber of years,”’ Bevan said.

The vice-president admitted
that economics is a factor in the
modification of the Eight
culiege Exchange Program.
The number of students from
Davidson : participating in the
program has dwindled over the
past few years, and almost. all
the students, went to Hollins for
the creative writing and film
classes, ignoring the other
scnools.

““We’re having trouble trying
to keep our German and French
programs afloat,” Bevan ex-
plained. He added that other
colleges in the exchange

program are having similar
problems. :

Hollins, for instance, is run-
ning into difficulties with its
Spanish program, according to
Bevan. He hopes to revitalize
these international study op-
portunities through the
modification of the Eight
College Exchange Program=

Eight women from schools in
the exchange program presen-
tly attend Davidson. Six are
from Mary Baldwin, while one
comes from Randolph -Macon
Women’s College and one from
Hollins.

One exchange student felt
that Davidson is making a
mistake in withdrawing fro
the regular program.

“T think people around here

could learn a lot by going to

other schools, as far as majors
are concerned.”’

She said that the psychology
program at Hollins is stronger
than the one at Davidson and
that the sociology program at
Randolph-Macon also is better.

“T feel like the approach to
academiés.jis more traditional
here; too much is spoon-fed and
then given back to the
professor,”’ she remarked. The
exchange student said that
Davidson students working at
other schools for a year may
learn to apply his or her lear-
ning more completely.

The student indicated that
being in a women’s school for
two years before coming to
Davidson helped her gain a con-
fidence that the women at
Davidson seem to lack.

Women at Davidson seem to
be intimidated in class to a cer-
tain extent, according to this
student.

The exchange student has en-
joyed being at Davidson, she
said. ‘‘Davidson is larger , and I
am not as pampered here. I feel
more independent socially
here,”’ she concluded.

Other colleges part cipating
in the Eight College Exchange
Program include Hampden-
Sydney and Washington and

Jr., a Davidson professor of
French, died Friday morning
of undetermined causes. He
was 49 years old.

morning, Meeks was taken to a
hospital in Charlotte where he

died. Meeks suffered from

by Meeks’ students and _ par-

diabetes and a heart condition, ~ ticularly those who went to

but it is not yet known whether
these difficulties contributed to
his death. A post-mortem
spinal tap revealed blood in
Meeks’ spinal column.

United Methodist Church. The
funeral was heavily attended

‘The River Niger’ Flows To

By ANNE PELFREY
Asst. News Editor

A touring Broadway cast will
appear in Love Auditorium this
Wednesday at 8 p.m. to present
the ‘‘River Niger,’’ a play about
a black family’s life and
struggles in Harlem.

The play has won over 20
awards including the 1974 Tony
for Best Play.

“Davidson is the first to
present the play in this area and
that makes us a kind of leader in
the area,’’ said Russell
Kushigian, Assistant Director
of the College Union.

“Bringing this play here is
part of bringing the best of the
performing arts to Davidson,”’
he said.

The Black Student Coalition
under the leadership of Reggie
Harding played @jlarge part in
bringing the play to Davidson. '

“I heard apout this play and »writing and performance. of

thought it would be a great thing
for this campus. So I convinced
Frazier Marsh and C. Shaw
Smith of the play’s value,’”’ said
Harding.

“This is a very good play—the
best being. from Braodway—
and it’s black oriented,’’ he
said.

“T don’t think it’s good just
because it’s black oriented, but
that’s an extra plus,’’ he added.

Joseph A. Walker who wrote
the play, also directs the touring
company for the play. Walker
and his wife Dorothy have
managed to form and maintain
their own acting company.

About his troupe Walker said:
“We wanted to train them
before they become bewildered
and ruined by the Broadway
success syndrome.”’

Walker shows his love of the

P. E. Changes

The physical education
requirements as they now
stand, are accurately described
on page 31 of 1974-75 Davidson
College Catalogue, according to
Director of Physical Education
Chip Stone.

Each student is required to
‘demonstrate or attain
proficiency in one team sport
and in four individual or dual
sports.”

The following changes are
pending before the faculty:

1. The proficiency tests will
be eliminated from the team
sports altogether. All one has
to do is participate and credit
will be given. The idea behind
this is that each student should
experience a team situation.

2. The proficiency tests for

the individual or dual sports,

will be pal only certain
times during each term, say the
first two weeks. A student may

take the test at the start of the.
term. If he passes the test, he

will be given credit for that
sport. Otherwise, he can then
elect to take the class. Again,
all he has to do is participate in
the class to receive credit. No
proficiency tests will be
required of students taking the
class.

3. A student mayelect to take
two team sports and ‘three in-
dividual or dual sports, or one

and four.

4. The clause that a student
must meet the P.E. require-
ments by the beginning of his
junior year will be dropped
altogether. It was never in-
tended for this to be strictly en-
forced. It was just to discourage
students from putting off all
requirements until the last
minute.

5. Intramurals will count for
credit: Cheerleaders and pep
band members will also receive
a P.E. credit.

said Hedrick. He also said that
the Davidson chapter of PIRG
is trying to locate diseased
workers and put them in touch
with the people who can grant
them compensation. ‘“‘We will
have'difficulties with the Brown
Lung project, however, because
some mill owners deny the
existence of disease,” stated
Hedrick.

Prescription drugs and retur-
nable bottle and can legislation
are but a couple of research
areas that Davidson-N.C. Pirg
will pursue in the coming mon-
ths.
