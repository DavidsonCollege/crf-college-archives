SPRINGING INTO FASHION

What’s in and out of style this upcoming Spring season

By ADRIENNE ‘NIXON
Fashion Authority

Ah, spring is in the air! It’s
time to start creating your spring
wardrobe. Thinking of grabbing
the nearest J. Crewcatalog? Don’t
bother. Chances are, most depart-
ment stores carry close to the same
merchandise at much lower prices.
There are, so many ways to look
great for less.

For instance, instead of run-
ning out and buying a ton of new
shorts before warm weather sets
in, go into your closet, find some
old pairs of pants and make some
cute cut-offs. As I was casually
leafing through a catalog, I saw a
pair of frayed denim cut-offs for
$28. What an incredible waste of
money! I am sure Daisy Duke
didn’t pay that much for hers.

Keep in mind that these cut-
offs don’t have to be denim. Asa
matter of fact, this idea will work

very well with those horribly loud,
polyester, double- knit reversable

slacks you found in the attic over -

the summer that are too atrocious
to be worn to even the tackiest of
tacky parties. Besides, they usu-
ally come in the same bright pas-
tels that will be gracing runways
and magazine covers all over the
world this season.

I know, I know. You're ask-
ing, “What in the world would I
wear with those?” Well, t-shirts or
shorts, light sweaters in either neu-
tral shades (like black, white, and
tan), or tastefully contrasting col-
ors (like a sky blue shirt with navy
shorts) would be ideal. For you
truly brave souls there’s always
the option of a ’70s_ print shirt
containing at least a hint of the
color of your shorts. However, I
must admit, this usually works best
for women. Guys should probably
stick to blue denim shorts and a
cotton t-shirt, but don’t worry, the

shirts can be as bright as you want
them to be. Being male doesn’t
lock you into plain white, boyish
blue, or basic black.

As long as I’m on the subject
of what works and what doesn’t, I
think I'll pass on a few general
fashion tips that will help keep
both ladies and gentlemen on top
of ‘things. Mind you, I’m not a
fashion queen or anything, but
when you’re the daughter of a good
southern belle, there are a few help-
ful hints you’re sort of forced to
grow up with!

Let’s start with the men. I
must say that most Davidson guys
do areally good job dressing them-
selves (even though, as busy as we
all are, it’s probably the last thing
on their minds). Therefore, I have

. only two things to talk about. The

first being the effective use of pat-
terns and prints. One interesting
print among solids can bring an
outfit to life. On the other hand,

The most important thing about fashion is to be

creative and have fun with it. Just ask El Jefe.

more than one at a time can result
in an appearance on the Ricki Lake
Show! My other comment? Please,
no knee socks (especially black
ones) with shorts. It’s just not
sexy.

As for the stylish ladies of
Davidson (no sarcasm intended), I
also have only a couple of com-
ments to make. When dressing,
it’s always important to accentuate
the positive. If you’ve got a great
pair of legs, feel free to show them
off with a smart little mini. How-
ever, don’t get carried away. If
you can’t retrieve the pencil you
just dropped without being picked
up on charges of indecent expo-

sure, chances are your skirt is just
a wee bit on the short side.

For daywear, the appropriate
length for a mini should be no
more than three to four inches
above the knee.

My other comment is more
related to beauty than fashion. Not
that I’ve seen it happen here or
anything, but please, no blue
eyeshadow unless your name is
Barbie, you drive a pink corvette,
and you have a plastic boyfriend
named Ken!

Above all, both guys and gals
should wear what they feel confi-
dent and comfortable in. After all,
fashion should be fun!

Ghanan gals cook
a path to our hearts

Naa Addo and Comfort Bawah share African cooking experience

By Laura LEIBFRIED
Staff Writer

Nearly a dozen students gath-
ered inthe Alumni House last Tues-
day evening for an introduction to
African cuisine. Our hosts, Naa
Addo and Comfort Bawah, two
endearing students from Ghana,
prepared a dish called “Jollof Rice,”
a spicy stew made with chicken
and rice in a tomato base.

With her left hand resting ca-
sually on her hip, Comfort sauteed
onions, tomato paste, and pureed
tomato juice in a pan of oil, while
Naa explained the cooking cus-
toms and lifestyles of her people.

In Ghana, JollofRice is an
elaborate dish, served at Christ-
mas time and other special occa-
sions. After the meal is cooked, it
is garnished with a colorful dis-

play of carrots, green beans and
boiled eggs. Various beverages
are consumed ‘during the meal,
from champagne to Irish Creme,
but never soft drinks or milk. Soft
drinks are saved for more informal
occasions, and milk is served with
desserts such as oranges and pine-
apples, baked plantains and créme
caramel.

Traditionally, the dish is pre-
pared with an entire chicken: beak,
feet, liver and all! The chicken is
deep-fried in a vat of oil, and the
leftover lard from the pan is added
to the stew for flavor. Adhering to
America’s dietary standards, the
girls browned the chicken wings in
half the oil they would normally
use, for a lighter, healthier meal.

In addition, for the benefit of
our milder, more conservative taste
buds, the girls omitted many of the

hot-hot seasonings of their home-
land, like fresh red bell peppers.
Instead, they added garlic, bay
leaves, and a light sprinkling of
pepper corns. “Trust me, we want
you to eat — and enjoy!” Naa
explained, laughing.

So far, the girls have not found
a food in the’States comparable in
spice and flavor to their own cook-
ing, although Thai food is a close
second.

’ Atlong last, the meal wascom-
plete. A delicious aroma saturated
the air.

Smiling proudly, Naa and
Comfort escorted the belly-growl-
ing bunch to the dining room.
Within minutes, murmurs of praise
resounded between mouthfuls of
piping hot stew. The perfect end to
an exciting, entertaining; and edu-
cational cooking class — the food!
