JANUARY 28 DATE SET
FOR PRELIMINARIES

At a meeting held Monday afternoon,
the Debating Council decided on the
dates for holding the preliminaries and
finals for the intercollegiate debating
teams. The preliminaries will be held
in the respective society halls on Monday
night, January 28, and the four men
selected in each society on that night will
contest in the finals two weeks later, on
Monday night, February 11. The two
teams will be chosen at this time.

The subject for the preliminarits will
be, “Resolved, ‘That the successful prose-
cution of the war demands that all citi-
zens of Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and
Turkey, now residing in the United
States, be interned for the period of the
war.” This is the query that will be
used in the debate with LaFayette Col:
lege.

The Council is still at work on the
details of the two debates. The debate
with LaFayette will be held on March
22, but the place has not yet been set-
tled. The debate with Roanoke College
will be held at about the same time, at
Davidson. The subject for this debate
will be decided within the next week or
two, and will be used in the finals. “Vhis
is the first time in years that a debate
has been held where the students can
attend, and the Council places it here
with the hope that a greater interest in
intercollegiate debating may be aroused.

F

MEETINGS WERE POSTPONED.

Owing to the coldness of the Philan-
thropic Society Hall there was no mect-
ing of the society Saturday night.

The Eumenean's program consisted
only of the roll call due to the fact that
so few of the Freshmen who were to he
initiated were present. The initiation
will be held next Saturday night.

The program for the Phi Society, Sat-
urday night, is as follows:

Debate—Affirmative: J. W. Clark,
A. L. Foscue, C. Howell. Negative:
W. C. Cumming.-H. C. Hamilton, D.
W. Roberts. Orations: O. P. Hart,
R. E. McClure, T. C. Misenheimer.
Extemporaneous debate—Affirmative. S.
M. Davis. Negative: H. T. Lilly.

The subject for the regular debate is:
“Resolved, That the Federal Govern-
ment should permanently own and oper-
ate all interstate railroads of the United
States.””

Dr. J. W. Bradley, of Suchien, China.
will address the Y. M. C. A. meeting
tomorrow night at 6:45. Dr. Bradley
has charge of a large hospital in China
and tells of his experiences in an inter-
esting manner. He is a good speaker.
and all who hear him are sure to like
him.
