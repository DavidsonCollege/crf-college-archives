pression and hardship, they shared
and shared alike, and by all striving
together, they all managed to get
by. To date the congregation has
made the largest contribution to
the new high school of any group
in town by their garbeque last
spring.

The group is also very active in
meetings. Sunday School and
church are conducted on Sunday
morning, and there is a Sunday eve.
ning devotional for young people,
and for adults. On Monday eve-
nings there is a young couples
prayer cell and on Tuesday night
there is a Boy’s Club meeting. A
great many of the people come to-
gether on Wednesday nights for
prayer and Bible study, and on

with additions from time to time.
The first of these additions was
under the direction of Al D. Mc-
Clure in 1930, and the second under
the leadership of Bill Macy in 1946,

The first book of church order
was drawn up by student-pastor
Watson Street and Dr. C. M.
Richards, then pastor of the David-
son College Presbyterian Church;
and was adopted by the board of
directors in 1938, (It is of interest
to note that during World War I,
due to the lack of sufficient men,
women were called upon to serve
on the official board.)

Davidson Collége students who
have served as pastors of the Da-
vidson Unity Church are: Don
Brandon, Sid Morris, Roger Met-

because it was thought that the
two town churches would reach ev-
eryone. Dr. F. L. Jackson, treastirer
of Davidson College, saw  fhat
many of the mill workers were
still unreached, so in 1913, he re-
organized the'Sunday School, with
the help of Mrs. W. R. Grey (who
is still active in the Sunday School
as a teacher), and Miss Hattie
Thompson, The Sunday School ser-
vices were held in the afternoon,
because the teachers, had positions
at the Presbyterian Church. Mrs.
Grey said she can remember when
at times only two children would
come to the church school which

chunk by chunk, the freedom of the
people is being withdrawn and all

Whatever evil which may have
been inherent in big business is
now far over-shadowed by the larg-
er evil of big government. The big-
gest force of all has become the
most powerful, and through - long
tenure, the most corrupt. “Elect
us, elect us, you have nothing to
fear but fear itself and big busi.
ness.”? This is the cry of those in

had all the window panes broken
out, and no heat in the building.
Dr. Jackson conducted Thursday
evening prayer meetings and con-
tinued his work with the Sunday
School for eight years. He had al.
so worked with the Sunday School
when a student at Davidson Col-
lege.

Dr. Jaekson was succeeded by
John C. Bailey, dean of students at
Davidson College, who continued
as superintendent’ of the - Sunday
School until the college YMCA
took over the responsibility of syp-
plying teachers. The first student-
pastor, Dewitt Helms, camie. to the
church in 1927>

The official, organization of the:
Sunday School into an interdenom-
inational church was during the
pastorate of Rev. John Howard (in
1932. It was named the Davidson
Unity Church, because in it many
religious faiths were united into
one. About this time, a cabin was
built below the church building for.
recreational purposes, and is now
thé meeting place of the John
Howard - Bible. Class, The original
church building is still being used,

Jimmy Stimpson,

Kennedy Smartt and Matthew Mc.
Gowen have served in the past
few years as co-pastors, and at a
recent meeting of the Concord
Presbytery, they approved the call-
ing of Kennedy Smartt, 4 graduate
of Davidson College, as supply pas-
tor for the coming year.
Originally the membership was
entirely composed . of mill ‘em-
ployees, but now, With an enroll-
ment ‘of approximately 125, the
congregation is represented by
farmers, shop workers, Clerks, col-
lege employes, carpenters and mill
workers. The. membership is also

well represented in the nursing
field.
Although the congregation is

small, there is a great spirit of
Christian Brotherhood  dispfayed
among them. The people are al-
Ways eager to aid in any endeavor,
and continually show a spirit of
true love in time of sickness and
need. Through the years of de-

The church building as it stands
is in need of repair and an adequate
heating system. The church cabin,
where the pastor has lived for the
past three years, is not sufficient
for a minister and his wife. The first
thing the new church hopes to do
is build a manse. In the future,
they hope to erect a new church
building. They also hope to inaug-
urate a visual aid program for edu-
cational and religious purposes. It
is now seeking to call a full time
pastor and to reach those who are
not now active in some church.

The name Calvary was chosen
for the church because of the peo-
ple’s faith in the Victory of Cal.
vary, and because of their firm
determination to make all that “Cal-
vary” means (not only Christ's re.
demption of sin, but also his victory
over sin made possible for every
believer) a reality in their lives

power and daily the freedom of
the people is lessened, daily the
power of the government increases
in areas in which it was never
meant to function at all, daily this
robbing of the people's sacred herit-

‘age goes on and the “stabilization,”

“devaluation,” and “subsidy,’ and
by talk of “fair deals,” do not see
that freedom is departing. Has the
“freedom to” been lessened? The
answer is that it has been, is be-
ing, and will continue to be lessen--
ed unless the people awake. One
day they will awake. They will
know the masquerader for what it
ceally is — socialism. They will be-
moan their lost freedoms, but —
too late, too late.

An era is passing. The philosophy
planted by Franklin Delane Roose-
velt is reaching full fruition. Rank
and verdant, it is spreading its

green tentacles over all, choking

every growth it encounters: soon
it alone will rule triumphant over
all. The basic nature of man has
heen sacrificed to a corrupt pohti-
cal and economic ideology. Man,
born to create, will live to be but

once served him well became sick;
then, instead of trying to make it
well again, he has allowed it to be
murdered before his eyes.

When Stephen Douglas saw
clearly that the Civil War could not
be averted, he said, *“The South,

of her?” This, in paraphrased form,
is the question proposed by this

crushed before our very eyes. Man’s
basic, precious values and his very
nature are being defiled, distorted,
smashed. We, like Douglas, can

well ask, “Our nation, our poor

nation. What is to become of it?’
An era is passing. Do we wish it
to pass? Do we wish what will in-
evitably follow if we pursue the
present course? Have we lost what-
ever understanding we once pos-
sessed? An era is passing. What
do we propose to do about it? What
can we do?

affair will begin at 10 P. M., and
continue until 2 A. M. The set
tickets will guarantee admittance
to the proposed Friday afternoon
concert and the two dances. A half
hour intermission will allow time
for those who wish to visit the fra.
ternity houses for refreshments.

The Saturday program begins
with the completion of the cross
country meet with Randolph Macon

Free enterprise is being] in the stadium at 9:45, Ten o'clock

marks the time for the symbolic
highlight of the whole week end.
At this time everybody — students,
dates, alumni, faculty, and visitors
— will assemble for the dedication
of the new Charles Worth John-
ston Memorial Gymnasium. The
ceremony will feature the presen-
tation of the gym by the family of
the late noted man, including Mr.
R. Horace Johnston and his sister.
Following the dedication everyone
will assemble in groups marked by
placards showing the various re-
gions from which the people hail,
and thus will begin the “Parade of
Progress.” Led by our own and
several visiting bands the assem-
blage will march, from the gym,
around the front of Chambers, and
out toward the front campus to the
site of the new church, the actual
dimensions of which will have been
laid out by the surveying class.
Here will be held the official ground
breaking ceremony.

It is this “Parade of Progress’’
which will symbolize the great pro-
gress already attained in our de-
velopment program. Everyone on
the campus is urged to attend and
participate in this most significant
event. Plans now call for large
floats to be entered in the parade,
each: of which will be a model de-
picting the proposed church, the
fine arts quadrangle, the dormitory,
and the other objectives of the
campaign. .

From here, interested menibers
will adjourn, to Chambers Audi
torium, at which time inaugura-
tion of the new alumni officers will
be held and a report on the pro-
gress of the development campaign
made. The new alumni officers for
this term are: President, Mr. John
I. Smith of Greenville, S. C.; Vice-
President, Mr. Archie Shuford oi.
Hickory, N. C., who will- succeed
Mr. D. R. La Far of Gastonia, N.
C., and Mr. Martin L. Lafferty of
Concord, N, C.

Officials participating in the pro-
gram plan to include Chairman of
the Development Program, Mr. J.
Spencer Love of Washington, D.
C., who is chairman of the board
of Burlington Mills; Honorary
Chairman, Mr. H. Smith Richard-
son of New York City, who is
chairman of the executive commit-
tee of Vick Chemical Co.; and
Honorary Vice Chairman, Mr. E.
H. Little of New York €ity, who
is president of the Colgate-Palm-
olive-Peet Co,

From twelve o'clock until game
time a barbecue luncheon will be
served to everyone on the grounds
south of Chambers Building. At
the same time an invitation is ex-
tended to all to visit the Johnston
gymnasium where an open house
will be held both before and after
the game.

Two-thirty is kick-off time for
the football spectacle in Richard-
son Stadium, where the Wildcats
will clash with the Richmiond Spid-
ers. Again as in the past, a cup
will be awarded to the fraternity
having the best decorated house:
dormitories will also participate in
the decoration.

The Saturday night dance will
be held from eight until twelve
and will be informal.

The program for Sunday will
include a church service at 11 0’.
clock and an afternoon concert by
the Davidson College Band.

And thus with a special vesper
program at 7:30 P. M. the 1949
Davidson Homecoming will draw
toaclose. .

FORT BENNING...
(Continued From Page One)

The average day carried on in
this same vacation-like manner. Af-
ter a delightful noon meal, several
hours were given to rest before
the trip to a shady nook for an
afternoon of interesting instruc-
tion.

This, as we said, was the average
day. There were of course more
Strenuoas days—about 42 of them—
but all in all — ghe six weeks’ stay
was pleasant.

An account of Ft. Benning would
not be complete without
mention of Phenix City — the city
across the river. The streets of this
town are lined with churches and
the city should be best known for
"S nunneries and the fine milk
which it’s eating places serve, One
Davidsonian, having been kissed by
One of the nuns, refused to wash his
face for three weeks for fear of
washing away the holy mark which
she left. Some roamed the cities
by ways just to soak up the pleas-
ant atmosphere which prevailed.

Space does not Permit a full coy-
erage of all activities, but suffice it.
to say that the Chamber Maids
would have been justly proud of
their sons,

FRESHMEN VIOLATORS
(Continued From Page One)

6. Bill, Bledsloe: walking on
Brass, no freshman cap, refusal ‘to
carry laundry, no name plate, gross
disrespect.

7. Adrian Bowen: acting athletic
when he’s only a supporter, re-
maining incognito by not’ wearing
a name plate, prouder of his black ~
hair than the red cap. ‘

8. Dick Gilchrist: leaving football
game early, no freshman cap.

Rice is issuing a plea for all up-
perclassmen to cooperate in the
fullest with the court. He, especial-
ly would like for the student body
‘to be quieter in chapel in order to
shorten the meetings.
