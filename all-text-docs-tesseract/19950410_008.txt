Trouble i in paradise: The Court fee debate

Here’s what

So I’m just waking up
from my mid-afternoon post-
Organic test catnap. My
friendly
Davidsonian deliverer gives
mea warm smile as he hands
me this week’s issue.

“Did you hear the
news?” he says. Rubbing
my eyes I stammer a nega-
tive. He replies, “Yeah, the
Court’s closing all its par-
ties next year. You’re not an
independent, are you?”

“Well, actually I am,” I
reply.

“Oh sorrty...,” he says
as he nervously departed

neighborhood:

sures from national fraterni-
ties that accompany open
parties. Plus, it is definitely
not the God-given right of
every independent to free-
load off the social dues paid
by fraternity members.
However, this poses a
considerable dilemma. Ifmy
guess is right, many inde-
pendents will refuse to pay
the social fee that has been
levied for party attendance.
Formonetary, philosophical,
or other reasons, students
who chose independence in
the first place did so because
they did not wish to be be-

can no longer neglect the
social needs of its growing
independent population.
I’m not saying fraterni-
ties stink or should be abol-
ished from campus. But I
am saying that there is a se-
rious scarcity of entertain-
ment and social options at
Davidson for non-affiliated
students. Particularly at such
an academically challenging
school as this one, stress re-
lief in the form of social en-
tertainment is a vital part of
student sanity and health.
The administration needs to
recognize this and do some-

from my presence, tak-
ing warning from my
reddening face and the
smoke pouring out of
my nostrils.

Despite my initial

What makes the PCC

think independents
will want to buy
into the system?

thing about it.

I’m not sure what
the answer is, nor am I
certain that there is one
answer to this complex
problem. Maybe its a

anger, I stopped to reflect on
what I think is acritical issue
for our college. For those of
you that live under rocks,
the April 3rd issue of The
Davidsonian reported that
Patterson Court is planning
to charge a social fee for
independents who wish to
party on the court next year.
In essence, parties are being
closed to the student body as
a whole.

I cannot say I blame the
Patterson Court Council for
their decision. It’s actually
expected considering all the

insurance liabilities, alcohol

policy problems, and pres-

holden to a particular social
scene. What makes the
Patterson Court Council
think these same students
will want to buy into the
system now?

And now for the big

question. If the Court is no
longer a social option, what

else is there to do on campus
for Davidson independents?
As long as the Court has
open parties, the adminis-
tration can afford to some-
what overlook the growing
discontent among socially-
capable independents. But
with the possible departure
of open parties, the college

new Union, ornon-pledging
eating houses for men, or
coed eating houses, or even
a nightly cover charge for
attendance at an individual
court party. But whatever
the solution, changes need

to be made soon and without
hesitation. There are already

enough divisions in the stu-
dent body as it is. Ignoring
the situation any longer will
only fuel independents’ so-
cial frustrations. As a cam-
pus, we owe it to ourselves
to address and correct this
problem before it becomes
destructive to the very fabric
of Davidson.

Paid managers, paid
bartenders, paid police of-
ficers (armed), sober moni-
tors, IDers, social chairs,
house presidents and vice-
presidents—these are the
folks who could be in charge
at each Patterson Court party
next semester. If that isn’t
enough bureaucracy for you,
I don’t what is.

Granted, the Alcohol
Policy Committee (APC) has
had a hard job revising the
old rules of Patterson Court.
They began with some good,
solid ideas: simplify the
policy, make it effective,

management expense. This
benefit is voided, however,
by the real problem with the
new policy.

That is, house parties
become more “closed,” but
at the same time they be-
come more regulated and
less autonomous. In short,
greater bureaucracy results
that could eventually lead to
unfunded mandates. Under
a more minor adaptation of
the existing policy, this fee
would support cops, risk
managers, and bartenders.
Either the fee will be esca-
lated, or the house will be

trouble. 3) Strengthen the
Role of the Sober Monitors.
They’re free and they know
the territory. We definitely
don’t need risk mangers and
sober monitors. 4) Clarify
the Position of the Police.
Communication is key; let
house officers and cops dis-
cuss their roles with each
other. Keep police at open
functions, but allow a “rov-
ing” cop for date functions
and smaller gatherings. 5)
No ID Bracelets or Door
Checks. It would be ludi-
crous to barricade the back
doors, porch, and front door

give the houses respon-
sibilities, and alleviate
insurance problems, to
name a few. Unfortu-
nately, atits present state
the new policy falls

It would be ludicrous to gents. Such an atmo-

barricade the back doors, sphere is not what
porch, and front door

from independents.

Davidson wants; it
would also be impos-
sible in practice. Uti-

short. Take note that the
APC decides such policy,
not the PCC as the previous
Davidsonian implied.

In fact, The
Davidsonian and much of
the student body have over-
looked the worst part of the
Alcohol Policy Committee’s
new plan. Last week’s pa-
per concentrated on the
“cover charge” and the In-
dependent “suffering.”
There may be problems with

the idea of “court member- :

ship,” but they don’t arise
from helping alleviate insur-
ance stress and lighten the
Court’s tremendous risk

forced to foot the bill for
something they don’t need.

Retain a small indepen-
dent fee ($10-20) if neces-
sary for insurance, etc., but
decrease the party staff and

simplify the rules. Let’s
compromise: 1) No Paid
Bartenders. Intoxicated

folks can get beer from a
friend even if the “trained”
bartender refuses. 2) Elimi-
nate Risk Managers. The
Risk Managers may be ex-
cellent lobbyists, but what
do they do? What about
house officers? Let them
and the sober monitors in-
form the cop if there’s

lize our Honor Code, and
assume that those who have
not paid will not attend.
The Alcohol Policy
Committee has one of the
toughest jobs oncampus. Let
us not forget that its reform
thus far has some good
points, suchas removing reg-
istration requirements for
small, closed functions. But
the opportunity to improve
Patterson Court must not be
missed.. If those with the
final say in the matter stick
to the original goal of effi-
ciency, effectiveness, and
cooperation, something
could still be made of it.

Evolution: The elaborate truth

“Evolution simply requires that life adapt in response to a change in selective pressure.”

Eric Sapp has written three
articles in The Davidsonian ques-
tioning the validity of certain evo-
lutionary principles. Obviously,
Sapp draws most of his conclu-
sions without the benefit of a thor-
ough knowledge of evolution and
related concepts. Here are five of
Sapp’s quotes that constitute the
bulk of his flawed argument.

1. “Evolution contradicts the
_Law of Biogenesis (all life comes
from life).” The theory of evolu-
tion does not discount this law.
Although the study of evolution
raises many interesting questions
about the source of life and the
universe, evolution is atheory sepa-
rate from both Creationism and the
“Big Bang.” Regardless of nature’s
origins, life on earth has been
shaped by evolutionary forces

2. “Evolution requires that life
randomly and by chance become
more complex.” The word “‘com-
plex” is a subjective term that Sapp
has added to this theory. Is larger
more complex? Stronger? Longer-
lived? More intelligent? Evolu-

tion requires only that the organ-
isms better suited for survival live
longer and reproduce more than
others less well adapted to the en-
vironmental conditions. That said,
we can rephrase: ‘Evolution re-
quires that life randomly changes.”
The next problem lies in the term
“random.” Evolution is not at all a
random process. There is a clearly
definable environmental cause for
any evolutionary change. The ran-
dom factor is the event that brings
about the environmental change.
A drought could reduce the food
supply of a population, or volcanic
activity could force a community
to migrate into and disrupt another
community. One can hypothesize
as to whether or not these environ-
mental changes are following a
preformed plan, but this is not re-
lated to the theory of evolution.
Evolution simply requires that life
adapt in response to a change in
selective pressure.

3. “To date there has been no
evidence of a good mutation.” It is
true that almost all mutations are

detrimental and are thus quickly
selected out of a population. How-
ever, a detrimental mutation can
easily prove beneficial when com-
bined with a change in the geologi-
cal, meteorological, geographical,
or predatorial environment of the
mutated individual. A recent in-
stance of a “good mutation” is the
peppered moth of England, a clas-
sic example presented in almost
every introductory biology book.
The dark color of the moths thriv-
ing on the blackened tree trunks
arose from a mutation of the allele
which controlled the normal white
coloring of these moths.

4. “There are different kinds
of dogs which came from an origi-
nal source, but where is proof link-
ing dogs to any other animal”
(missing links)? Ican attribute this
statement only to Sapp’s lack of
research. Even a cursory study of
the fossil record reveals links be-
tween every type of animal. Fos-
sils of fish with the ability to breathe
air and make short excursions onto
land predate the evidence of am-

phibians on earth. Fossils of am-

- phibians with reptilian brain, heart,

and urogenital developments are
seen in the period before the first
reptiles appeared. Reptiles show
many mammalian traits in heart
and brain development that am-
phibians lack. The Therapsid rep-
tiles, thought to be direct precur-
sors to the mammals, had mamma-
lian skull and tooth structure, limb
arrangement, and other skeletal
adaptations not possessed by their
contemporaries (otherreptiles). No
fossils of mammals have been
found predating Therapsida sim-
ply because Mammalia did notexist
until created from this reptilian
off-shoot. A display of this can be
seen in an exhibit at the National
Museum of Natural History. The
entire vertebrate skeletal history is
exhibited in chronological order,
showing the sequential adaptations
made by each class of animal that
the next class built upon.

5. “Evolution should not be
taughtas fact.” lagree completely
with Sapp, but he argues a moot

point. Evolution should be taught
as a theory, but I believe that any-
one who objectively studies this
theory will come to accept it.

We have come to Davidson to
learn about the liberal arts and sci-
ences and through this process de-
velop an intelligent and informed
way of thinking. Given this, it
amazes me that a Davidson stu-
dent could make these statements.
People who have intensely studied
biology and evolution realize that
this theory is nearly indisputable,
while many people with little bio-
logical or evolutionary knowledge
continue to question it. The reason
for this discord is not that all scien-
tists are godless heathens, but in-
stead that they have researched
evolution extensively. Sapp’scon-
clusions about evolution are obvi-
ously a direct result a lack of re-
search on this topic. Anyone who
questions the theory of evolution
owes it to himself or herself to find
out the facts behind this theory
before making an uninformed
judgement.
