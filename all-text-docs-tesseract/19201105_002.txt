On the Gridiron

AND WE MUZZLED THE “BULL.
DOG.”

Features of the contest:

When Romefelt broke through and,
threw Jarvis for a ten yard loss; when_
on the next play, Faison dropped Pol- ,
lock for a five yard loss; Clary’s spec- |
tacular end runs; Hammett’s defensive :
work; “Bobby” Long’s broken field run-
ning; “Gig” Shepherd’s line bucking;
“Sam” Brady's goal kicking. |

“The ebony hue of Wake Forests colors,
We smeared into their gold;

With one wide swipe

Of the Wildcat’s paw,

The Spiders were crushed; we're told.

The smashing Bulldog came on with a
rush, ~
But was muzzled, ‘ere he got far;
The Gamecocks next
Their doom will mect,
When they try to cross Davidson's bar.”

Sophe vs. Fresh.

In the second of the inter-class bas-.
ketball series, the Soph quintet triumph- |
ed over the Fresh by a score of 29-12.
It was a much harder fought contest
than the score would indicate, the Fresh
giving their heavier rivals the stubborn-
est kind of opposition. During the first
half the scoring was nip and_ tuck,
neither side remaining in the lead more

younger opponents in weight, the teams
were fairly evenly matched in playing
ability. The Sophs were not as pro-
ficient in passing as they might have
been, but were able to cage the ball
much more effectually than were the
Fresh. Time and time again the Fresh
had the sphere under their desired goal,
but seemed unable to locate the basket
with sufficient accuracy.

In the second half however, the Sophs
appeared to be rejuvenated by the en-
trance into the game of Bostic at for-
ward, Mauze at center, and McLaren at
guard, and practically swept the Fresh
off their feet. The score at the end of
the first half stood at 11-7, but during
the last semester the Sophs, in addition
to keeping the Fresh to five more points,
came close to tripling their own scdre.
The whole Soph team played better ball
and the Fresh were unable to withstand
the onslaught. ,

For the victors Crawford played the
most consistent game, being in almost
every play from start to finish, During
the last half Mauze put up a good game,

course was not in the best of condition
and greatly hindered the work of both
sides. Nevertheless Davidson displayed
great skill since her first match. Re-
member fellows golf is under the auspi-
ces of the Athletic Association this year
and there is a chance for the coveted

any other form of Athletics. So show
the spirit and back the team in its
inter-collegiate matches which will fol-

wall and take an evening's exercise by
making the golf course hum to the tune
of Spaulding Fifties and Baby Dimples.

UNIVERSITY OF S. C. TO
PLAY HERE SATURDAY
Gamecocks, After Victory Over
Tigers, Now Seek Wildcat Blood.

The University of South Carolina in-
vades Davidson for the week-end. This
is the first and only game of the season
to be played at Sprunt Field. All indica-
tion are pointing to a hectic struggle.
Things are scheduled to start at 3:30
Saturday afternoon.

Up to date, the South Carolinians
have had a most successful season. They
have met some of the best teams of this
section and have certainly shown good
progress. Their first game was won
from Wofford, 14-0. The strong Uni-
versity of Ga. ran up several touch-
downs on them. Then came the Uni-
versity of N. C. and the 7-0 score indi-
cated how hard the Tar Heels had to
play for a victory.

The win from Clemson last week
marked their best achievement, however,
On this record they should have the
team to support the claims of victory
coming from Columbia:

On comparative scores the result
seems to be clothed in doubt. Their
good showing against Carolina and the
win from Clemson are evidence of their
strength both on the offensive and de-
fense. Davidson had the advantage
from the defeat of the Citadel as Citadel
