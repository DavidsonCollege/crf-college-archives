Three Egrets

1.

Three egrets lie in the grass
taking the morning sun,
while nursemaids rol!

their strollers by

and babies cry

pointing their fingers

at the snow white birds.

2:

Three egrets huddie in the isiandâ€™s shade
behing the willow tree

watching the skipping stones

of schoolboys

sink in the smooth water.

3.

Three egrets fly tothe willow tree
craning their necks to the west.
And the lovers

with interlocking fingers

pause

to watch the setting. sun.

4.

Three egrets sleep in the willow tree
one above and two below

while the iovers wait

on the damp grass

for darkness to fall.
