A forfeit made the difference against Catawba,
but this year’s wrestling team has lots of talent

—~—

The DAvidson. wrestling team lost its first dual match
of the season 22-20 *o Catawba, but Coach Bob Estock
was more pleased than not with his team’s perfor-

pretty good.” .

Pfeiffer tournament. Sophmore Tom Hissam, finished
second, at 117, junior Van Wagner wound up third at
142, and junior Chris Tiernan finished fourth at 158.
