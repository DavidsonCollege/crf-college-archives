Cash, 7000 Miles From Homelan
Adjusts Well To Campus Weekends

Let no sympathetic tear be shed
for the Davidsonian pining for the
girl back home in far away Mt.
Mourne—at least, not without first
considering the case of our amiable
South American student, Senor
Adolph Caravia Cash of Uruguay.
His thoughts are turning these
moonlit nights to a young lass
named Rachel—his bride of scare-
ly a year—whom he left behind
some seven thousand miles!

Not wishing to prolong any
longer than necessary the appli-
cation of the weathered adage,
“Distance makes the heart, etc,”
Adolph plans to have his wife join
him in this country as soon as she
completes her itbrary technician’s
training in Montivideo and can find
work in an American school. Until
then, however, he is cheerfully oc-
cupying himself with his studies at
DC, and is rapidly finding a place
for himself in the life of the cam-
pus.

The twenty-seven-year-old archi-
tectural aspirant comes to our col-
lege under the joint sponsorship
of the Charlotte Rotary Club and
the Boys’ Choir of Charlotte, in a
program to bring the youth of our
two republics closer together. Al-
though Davidson is hardly the
place to study architecture, he says
the mere opportunity of going to
school in the United States was
too good to pass up. Moreover,
even the casual observer readliy
sees that our poly-linguistic Span-
jard likes education for its own
sake, and will benefit greatly from
any field of study to which he sets
himself.

Adjusting himself to his new
life has been made comparatively
easy through his excellent com-
mand of the English language and
by virtue of the remarkable simi-
larity between the Carolinas and
his aative Uruguay. This latter fact

By BILL MOFFETT

should cause no end of amazement
to the average American citizen,
who is notoriously ignorant of the
way of life of his southern neigh-
bors, and who, disregarding the
tremendous variety in the climate
and topography of the South
American continent, is prone to
think of her in terms of tropical
jungles, uncivilized Indians, coffee
beans, craggy mountains, and bi-
monthly revolutions.

The American visitor to Uruguay
would doubtless be agreeably sur-
prised to find in her broad Atlan-
tic resort beaches, the gently roll-
ing grasslands, the textile mills
and tobacco barns, and her stable,
democratic government, a country
and people not unlike those of
our own Carolinas. Adoiph’s home-
town, Montivideo, the capital of
Uruguay, is situated on the Atlan-
tic coast almost exactly the same
distance from the equator as Spar-
tanburg, and enjoys a climate simi-
lar to that of Wilmington.

Uruguay is the smallest of the
South American republics, but it is
by no means least in the field of
social legislation and democratic
freedom. Her government, one of
the most stable in Latin America
since the turn of the century, Is
organized after the pattern of the
United States, with the exception
that the executive power is in the
hands of a council rather than one
man. Although lying in the shadow
of Argentina, she seems in no way
intimidated by the specter of Juan
Peron as she leds the fight for a
free press and personal liberty.
Uruguayans rank first in the con-
tinent in religious toleration, in
social rights and privileges, and
in free, secular education. Her
extremely low illiteracy rate at-
tests to the success of the latter,
‘through which a student may re-
ceive without costs all twenty-

two years necessary for a degree.

In leaving his country to come
to Davidson, one of the only real
adjustments Adolph has had to
make is in regard to his name.
Although he is known on the cam-
pus as Adolph Cash, or more often
simply as “Cash,” his last name is
merely the family name of his
mother, an Englishwoman, and is
more comparable to our middle
name. At home he would be re.
ferred to as Senior Caravia, family
name inherited from his Spanish
father, a prominent architect in
Montivideo. In addition to this
change, he is having trouble _re-
membering that October means
autumn, since the countryside of
Uruguay is experiencing the color-
ful return of Spring.

In discussing the various aspects
of his new environment, Cash was
quick to say that he enjoys our
brand of football, but his smiling
eyes were unable to hide his dis-
appointment at not finding a soc-
cer team at Davidson. Uruguayans,
like most South Americans, are
avid sports fans, and play their
national game with so much zest
and forvor that referees are sub-
stituted much more frequently
than players, After soccer, basket-
ball ranks highest in popularity,
and his tiny country has always
been a flerce opponent of its larger
neighbors, Brazil and Argentina, as
well as nations the world over, win-
ning its last International Basket-
ball Championship only three years
ago.

But whether discussing sports or
politics, Adolph displays such
courtesy, such ease and intelli-
gence in conversation, and such a
friendly attitude toward his lis:
teners, that he appears to be living
proof of the values of our exchange

program.

Students accepted for admission
or attending a graduate school
prior to July 1, 1951, satisfy the
criteria if their work continues to
be satisfactory. Graduate students
admitted or attending after July
1, 1951, must have been’ in the
upper half of their classes during
their senior year or make a score
of 75 or better on the test. It is not
mandatory for local board to defer

Freshmen Group

A discussion group for fresh-
men only will meet in the Student
Lounge of the church on Tuesday
evening. The theme will be “Chris-
tianity and Davidson,” and Chris-
tianity as it relates to the honor
system and other Davidson features
will be discussed. Discussions will
be led by Professor Wilson, Pro-
fessor Baumann, Leighton Mce-
Cutchen, and Mike York.

This is the first time that such
an all-freshman discussion meeting
has been held, and it is hoped that
it will lead to other freshman dis-
cussion groups in the future.

Dr. Docherty will be available
for personal conferences at the
Guest House from 2 to 3 o'clock
Monday and Tuesday afternoons.
Students who desire such a confer-
ence should make an appointment
through the YMCA office.

Docherty Scotch

Dr. Docherty was born in Glas-
gow, Scotland, and received his
early education in the Glasgow
public schools. He received his
M.A. from the University of Glas-
gow in 1935 and his B.D. from
Trinity College in 1938, The Doc-
tor of Divinity degree was con-
fererd by Temple University of
Philadelphia in 1950.

From 1939 to 1944 he was min-
ister at Sandyhills Church of Scot-
land. From 1944 to 1947 he dis-
tinguished himself as minister-co-
adjutor at Barony of Glasgow,
where special work was done
among young people under the
auspicies of the Iona Youth Trust,
working along the principles of the
lona community.

Pr. Docherty served as minister
at North ‘Church, Aberdeen, dur-
ing the years 1947-1950. Then he
was called to Washington, D. C.,
where he has served with distinc-
tion as the minister of the New
York Avenue Presbyterian Church.
This church is known as_ the
“Church of the Presidents,” and
Dr. Docherty is the successor of
the late Dr. Peter Marshall.

He delivered the Ashlin White
Bible Lectures at the Virst Pres-
byterian Church of Mooresville last
year, and while he was in North
Carolina he spoke to the Davidson
students in chapel.

Saturday's leg injury spelled

suffered a shoulder separation last
year in the Richmond game which

ended his 1952 action.

Gray has proved himself one of
the coolest quarterbacks in the
business and was really a smooth
operator in the games this “year

be sorely missed in the remaining

Thus, we offer this final tribute

Docket For Court Settles Down:
13 Face Tribunal Last Monday

The docket for the Freshman
Court of Control has settled down
somewhat since the first session.
Thirteen boys were hailed before
the tribunal in the green room of
the Student Union Monday night.
All were found guilty except two.

Warner Hall was charged with
making slighting remarks to up-
perclassmen, being cocky, and hav-
ing a superior attitude and a nasty
disposition.

Bob Moffett was brought before
the court for general obnoxious-
ness, having a cocky attitude, re-
peatedly showing disrespect to up-
perclassmen, and having a superi-
ority complex, and not wearing
his prescribed freshman hat.

John Edwards was charged with
showing conduct unbecoming a

week, especially passing offense
and defense. When asked about
tomorrow's game, Dole replied,
“We hope that we can continue to
cut down on our mistakes. The
boys have worked hard and have
shown fine spirit. We hope to
match the inspired play of last

year’s game.” .

.Jim Thacker, who leads the
Southern Conference in punting,
will be Davidson's leading threat
in the backfield. Thacker has
averaged 45.2 yards per kick this
season in addition to his passing
and running ability.

now superfluous. Under the pres-
ent conditions, a student would be
perfectly justified to refuse to
sign the pledge despite the pro-
fessor’s request for it. Of course,
this type of action would only
lead to further confusion which
could do no possible good to the
honor system in regard to cheat-
ing. I would hate to be the man

who may one day have to tell;

himself, “It was when I was Presi-
dent of the Student Body that Da-
vidson’s most admirable tradition,
honor in the classroom, began its
decline.”

Davidson gentleman, and especial-
ly a freshman.”

Bill Shuford and Randy Johnston
were hailed before the court for
failure to wear their freshman
beanies.

Bill Gramley was tried for fail-
ure to wave his hat at a pep rally,
poor spirit, and little | participa-
tion in said pep rally. He was
found not guilty.

Richard James was brought be-
fore the court for failure to ad-
here to the orders set down by the
court in a previous trial, by not
wearing placards when told to do
so. He was also said to have a
cocky attitude, and was seen with-
out his nametag.

Guy Hunt was charged with get-
ting out of his chapel seat with a
contemptious grin, before all up-
perclassmen had cleared the room.
He was found to be not guilty.

Snyder Garirson, Sonny Kincey,
Dan Haley, and Buster Jenkins
were brought before the court for
not wearing their nametags dur-
ing homecoming weekend.

Bill Currie was charged with not
knowing the freshman rules and
regulations, constant refusal to go
to the stud, using language un-
becoming a Davidson gentleman,
having a sigh school attitude, and
being generally obnoxious.

The penalties dealt out by the
court for the various offenses, tak-
ing into consideration their severi-

(|number of the offenders were ap-

pointed as stud boys for various
dorms and fraternity houses; some
were to clean football shoes; news-
paper folding was also one of the
penalties prescribed.

Some of the boys were to wear
a red ribbon attached from their
hat to the belt, as a reminder to
always keep the hat on; another
pugishment issued from the court
was the wearing of a placard on
the front and the back, as a re-
minder to upperclassmen to ask
the offender certain questions.
