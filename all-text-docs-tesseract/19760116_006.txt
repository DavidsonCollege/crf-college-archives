Reshuffled union plans Mid-winters

By BRAD SWALWELL
Senior News Editor

The Union Board at this
week’s meeting finalized plans
for the activities to be held
during Midwinters Weekend.
Midwinters will be the week-
end of January 23-24. .

‘‘There’s going to be alot
going on,”’ said Social Com-
mittee Chairman Robert M.
Mayer. “Wednesday through
Saturday that week Robin and
Linda Williams will be per-
forming in the 900 Room.

“Also, the Drama Depart-
ment will present the play
Curse You, Jack Dalton three
times, beginning Thursday
that week. There will be
performances Thursday and
Friday night at 11 p.m. and
Sunday afternoon at 2:30,’’
said Mayer.

Mayer went on to outline
some of the other activities
planned for Midwinters. Fri-
day night, in addition to the
Pop Film (the title of which
has not been decided at this

time), there will be a formal
dance.

The band will be Frankie
Lester and the Steel Pier
Orchestra with the Big Band
Cavalcade.

“We are working with Zack
Long in the Alumni Office to
try and get a dance class set
up for Friday afternoon,’’ said
Mayer.

Saturday afternoon will be
the Davidson vs. South Caro-
lina basketball game. ‘‘Dress
will be in the spirit of the
1950’s. The group (hall, frat-
ernity, eating club, etc.) who
comes to the game dressed
best in the 50’s spirit will win a
keg,’’ said Mayer.

“There will also hopefully be
a reception in the 900 Room
after the game,” he added.

The concert Saturday night
will be with Wet Willie, along
with Robin and Linda Wil-
liams to. open the show. The
concert will be from 8-11 p.m.

In other action, the board
voted to revamp the Unio:

collection with the help of a
YMCA book drive and there
are good relations with the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg _lib-
rary system.

A cook school, which
teaches inmates how to cook,
Otey feels is the best program
offered, as it provides practi-
cal training. One former in-

mate is employed at Slug’s
Rib in Charlotte.

“Assistant Professor of
Sociology Robert D. Ruth’s
course to provide contact with
prisoners and take honor
grade prisoners out of the
camp is effective also,’’ said
Otey. “‘Local authorities are
aware of the problems and
have good relations with Dav-
idson College.

committee structure. The
Union presently operates with
16 committees. In a move
proposed by Union President
Karl E. Goodhouse, the board
streamlined the structure by
reducing the number of com-
mittees to 12.

As a result of this change,
several committees were elim-
inated by being merged into a
single committee and another
committee was eliminated by
being made a sub-committee
of an existing committee.

Goodhouse commented on
the effect he expected the
reorganization to have. “Basi-
cally, it will make the organi-

zation a heck of a lot easier to-

work with.

“First, we have reduced the
number of committee chair-
men we have to work with
from 16 to 12. This will
streamline things.

‘Second, we have put some
committees where they be-
longed in the first place.

“Third, we have combined

workers, which strengthens
their ability to do their job.
Some committees were having
trouble getting tieir work
done. This move will make it
easier for them,” said Good-
house.

“In short, we have created a
more convenient and func-
tional body which should be
able to produce maximum

programming,’’ he added.

Also, the board approved an
Outing Club request for $250
to help fund their Outward
Bound mini-course which will
be held over Spring break. The
board referred to the Execu-

tive Committee a report on the
possibility of establishing a
weekend check-cashing service
in the Union.
