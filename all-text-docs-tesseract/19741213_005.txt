“The major issues we need
to confront include reshaping
the environment at Davidson
through a permanent com-
mitment to psychological
counseling, and with that, an
ongoing program, and con-
cern for protection of student
rights, including due
process,” said Munce.

“We also need to address
the ongoing problems of
student housing, laundry, food
services, the college union,
and the social system.

“Further, we need to in-
crease the benefits of student
association, for example,
through supporting the
National Student Association
and the National Student Lob-
by in their efforts to increase
federal benefits to students,
making legal counsel more
available, and providing bet-
ter services such as calculator
rental, insurance, and travel
programs.

“We need to move to a
greater consideration of coed
dorms, including coed dorms
for freshmen, actively
pushing for stabilization of the
size of the student body until
housing can be provided. We
must designate construction
of new Housing as a top
priority for the college, and
students must play significant
roles in these decisions.’

Munce also expressed con-
cern about the present laun-

dry operations and college
food services.

“We need to make the move
to a voluntary laundry with in-
creased self-service and a

complete re-evaluation of the ©
‘ kinds of service the laundry

offers.

“T’m also concerned about
the limited alternatives to
eating on Patterson Court or
at ARA Slater. We need to
make__ kitchen - facilities
available to students.

“We must’ also better in-

‘tegrate the new food services

to be offered at the new
college union with present
facilities than has been
thusfar planned,’’ Munce

‘ maintained.

Munce also felt the need for
better programming by the
college union and expressed
concern for added im-
provements to the new college
union facility.

“We need to support what is
presently underway in the
construction of the new
college union and make con-
tinued evaluation of the
adequacy of the new facility.
Of particular concern is office
space, the game room, and the
promotion of informal
gatherings on a continuing
basis.

“I think the new college

spoke to the Senate on the
recent self study report. The
report. is required every 10
years for accreditation and it
covers a wide range of sub-
jects concerning Davidson.
Proctor stated that student
assistance was solicited
because: “We felt that it
should be a community en-
‘terprise, with students in-
volved, not just the faculty.”
Next Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday a committee will
visit Davidson to talk
students, faculty and ad-
ministrative personnel to
complete the study.
Proctor added that, ‘the
final report is a condensation
of earlier drafts.” In the
report recommendations are
made for the future. The last
report resulted in major
thanges, including the con-
struction of the E.H. Little
Library and a major change
in the curriculum.
Copies of the new report are
on reserve in the library.

there be a strong increase in

the number and the variety of
social programs sponsored by
the union as well as increased
cultural experiences. The
temporary union has too |

been used as a subedansthots
excuse affecting program-
nae decisions,”” Munce ad-

“‘We also need to come to
some resolution of the
limitations on the number of
organizations on Patterson
Court and the problems of in-
tegrating off-campus frater-
nities.

“With a continued com-
mitment to the self-selection
method because it has worked
and because even with a
student body of 1300, a rush
method puts unnecessary
strain on cohesion in the

. system, we must work toward

expanding Patterson Court as

well as union programming,”

Munce was ne er sup-
portive of student government
under current SGA President
Blain Butner, but -had some
strong criticisms of the
present Senate and govern-
ment processes.

t

_ “Blain has succeeded in
running a_ solid = ad-
ministration. He has
developed rapports based on
respect with the faculty, ad-
ministration and Board of
Trustees, and he has com-
mitted countless hours to sim-
ply talking with students

sacked

about work they’re doing or
encouraging them to take on
some project.

“His administration has
also seen SGA funding of a
psychological counselor, ef-
forts to define student rights,
and efforts to protect due

process.

__ “However, in the past, the.
SGA president has not suf-—
ficiently recognized or
reprimanded those people who
have or have not ac-

complished the duties with W®
they were charged,” §

‘Munce maintained.

“The failures of the Senate
are involved in that it has no
firm conception of its role, and
it tends to flounder in trivial
matters. It is plagued by the
same restrictions on the time,
energy and interest of its
members as is. any other
bad gy

“The first tends to be a

problem in any meeting and
‘can be alleviated by. a firmer
grasp by genators of what's
‘going on and a firmer com-
itment. to stick to the
, Said Munce.

"Munce feels that through
“closer coordination of people
charged with responsibility,
utilization of non-Senate mem-
bers in working toward
resolution of problems, and by
constant evaluation of

to insure that the
is - being done,” the
it government can over-
come- the myth of its im-
potence and ‘work toward
positive changes in life at
