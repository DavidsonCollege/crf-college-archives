Men’s soccer splits with Wake and Citadel

By Anby LANOHA

Davidson men’s soccer survived another
week of ups and downs. Last Wednesday
night the fell 2-0 to the Demon Deacons of
Wake Forest. It was a hard fought match that
Davidson seemed to be controlling, but in the
end, the Deacons came up with the win. The
Cats didn’t lie down for long, however. And,
this Sunday they launched an all-out assault
on’ The Citadel winning 8-0 and scoring 4

_ goals in the first 11 minutes of play.
Davidson’s loss to Wake Forest was espe-
ecsially heart-breaking because Davidson
looked like the better team for most of the
game. Just as they had against South Caro-
lina, the Cats came out strong and controlled.
the game for the first 45 minutes.
The 0-0 tie at half time promised good
things for the Cats, who seemed due to finally
break the Deacon’s defense.
But, Wake

locker room
hungrier than
Davidson and Jamal Seale put in Wake’s
first, and the eventual game-winner, just one

- minute into the second half.

“We have been talking all year about how
we respond to things,”said senior co-captain
Dave Buehler. “How we respond to goals or
tough losses. I guess we didn’t respond well
to being tied 0-0 at half.”

Davidson fought hard after going down 1-
0. The Cats pushed Wake into their defensive
end, pounding the net and sending everyone
forward to get the tying goal, Unfortunately
that goal wouldn’t come. In the 70" minute,

r- Wake Forest was able to take advantage of

a.

Davidson’s aggressive attack. The Deacons

counter-attacked and caught Davidson’s last

defender in a two-on-one situation. Wake’s

Ben Stafford used the numbers to his advan-
tage and broke
away from the
defense scoring
the final goal of
the match.

_. Neither
Davidson nor
their supporters

believed it was over at this point. With 20

minutes left and even until the last seconds,

Davidson continued to fight. Despite creat-

ing many

chances in this
final period and
throughout the
game, the Cats’
finishing woes

-kept them off the

scoreboard.

“We had lots of
opportunities,”
said Buehler. “If
we had scored
first or even fin-
ished one of out
late chances, the
game would have
ended a lot dif-
ferently.”

Similar to the
last minute loss to South Carolina, the hard
loss to Wake left the ‘Cats with a lot to think
about. “We were frustrated because we be-
lieve in ourselves,” said co-captain Dane
Erickson. “We know we have the pieces to
the puzzle to be a nationally competitive team
.... We go out, play well, and prove we can
control the game against top ranked teams,
yet we still lose.” a

The Ciits feelings of frustration didn’t last

long into the second game however .. . 11
minutes at most.

Davidson opened the game against The
Citadel scoring what must be a record setting
four goals in the first 11 minutes of play.

Junior Erik Ozimeck opened the scoring
just 50 seconds into the play, scoring
a“wicked” diving header. “I whipped in a
cross from the left side,” recalled David
Peoples who assisted on the play. “Oz was
open about the penalty spot and headed it
right into the lower corner. It was an excel-
lent finish for sure.”

The Cats kept rolling. Just two minutes
later Chris Norbet added to the tally off
another David
Peopleis assist.
Norbetis header
took the fight out
of The Citadel.
But, the Cats had
no intention of
slowing down.

Dane Erickson
notched his first
goal of the season
and Davidson’s
third in the 11"
minute of play.

50 seconds later when he beat a couple Cita-
del defenders and fired home an unassisted
goal, his sixth on the year.

Senior Day dominance for field hockey

By Mike ANDERSON

What scoring problem?

After the Wildcats had shown a propensity
to dominate field play but lose the scoring
battle throughout much of this ‘season,: the

squad erupted
on Sunday for
a ‘10-3 Senior
Day. victory
over Catawba.
Five differ-
ent Wildcats
found the back
of the net as Davidson scored ten goals for the
first time since 1980.
Senior :Lea Jaeger led the way with five

(count ‘em, five) goals—giving her 11 of the
season, the most for any NorPac player. Agnes
Bateman scored her ninth goal on Saturday,
which puts her just behind Jaeger in second
place amongst the seven-team conference.

But the headline shot of the day belonged to
senior Lauren Hancock, usually a defender,
who took full advantage of her last home
game by scoring her first-ever collegiate goal
ona penalty stroke with 22:52 to play. Appar-
ently Hancock felt quite at home in. her
newfound scoring role, as the Severna Park
(Md.) High School grad added her second
career goal with one minute to play.

“Tt was just great,” said Hancock. “To
score your first-ever goal on Senior Day, in
your last ever home field hockey game, I

couldn’t have asked for anything more.”

“She had been dying to get a goal for three
years,” said head coach Jen Halliday. “So we
moved her up to play forward (instead of her
usual defensive position) in the second half,
and she was so excited to get that first goal.”

“Tt was a huge weekend for us,” continued
Halliday, whose squad improved to 6-5, push-
ing them over the .500 mark for the first time
since late August. “We couldn’t ask for a
better transition into fall break.” :

The Cats, will hit the road this weekend,
trekking to Pennsylvania where they will
play a series of three games against Ursinus,
Rider, and NorPac foe Southwest Missouri
State.

Medical Center Player of the Game, when he
scored in the 25" minute of play. This ended
the Cats first half assault and sent them into
the locker room leading 5-0. :
“We came out really hard because we were
frustrated from the Wake game. We were
determined to get some offensive production
and we did,” said Peoples.
Davidson finished the game just as they
had started, scoring. In the 50" minute, —

‘Ozimeck got his second goal of the game

finishing home a deflected shot from Jon
Teterick.

13 minutes later Paul Watson got his first
goal of the season when he finished a ball on
the back post. Joel Sadler started the play on
the right side whipping in a low cross. Senior
Bryan Garrett flicked the ball through a gap to
a streaking Watson who finished it without

‘ hesitation.

Sadler finished the scoring at the 73-minute

mark. He received a ball at his feet inside the
box. With his back to the goal, he turned
tightly to his left, beating the defender and
finding the open space at the far post all in one
motion.
. “It was a really good time for us to blow a
team out,” said Erickson. “We were able to
ease a lot of our frustrations at not scoring
against Wake.” .

Jason Baran said that he knew the Cats
were going to win. After the game, the

loquacious freshman recalled, “Last night I

had a dream that we beat The Citadel 6-0, ©
when I woke upI was sad. Because I knew we
could beat The Citadel by a lot more goals
than that.” ;

Davidson will take this big win into two
more must-win Southern Conference
matches, Tuesday at home against VMI and
Thursday away against Wofford.
