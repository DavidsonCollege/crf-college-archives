College Hits Top
9 Months Early

Nine months ahead of schedule, Davidson has
reached and exceeded its Ford Challenge Campaign
goal of $5.5 million in gifts and pledges, President D.
Grier Martin announced tonight.

In June of 1968, when all gifts have been received
and all pledges paid in the campaign, Davidson will
qualify for $2.2 million in challenge funds from the

Ford Foundation, the

president said.

“This splendid result...
is tangible evidence that the
college can reach its long
range ‘Decade of Destiny’
goal of $25.300.000 by 1975.”
he said.

National fund drive  co-
‘chairmen William A. White,
Jr. of Charlotte and Walter L.
‘Lingle. Jr. of Cincinnati,
Ohio, praised the hundreds of
volunteer regional workers
‘and alumni class agents who
made the largest financial
drive in Davidson's history a
success.

Davidson's ‘‘Decade of Des-
tiny’ program for the period
1965-1975 was formulated on
the basis of studies in 1963-
1964, which found that dur-
ing those 10 years the college
would need about $25,300,000.

This money is ‘‘to provide
an educational program sec-
ond to none. to double its en-
dowment and thus assure
adequate financial undergird.

No Vespers

Compulsory church attend-
ance for students was offi-
cially discontinued today by
the trustees.

Accepting a recommenda-
tion of its Religious Life Com-
mittee, the Board made per-
manent the suspension of
Vespers it had recommended
in the spring of 1966.

In making the announce.
ment, President D. Grier
Martin emphasized that it
*was still possible Tor the
trustees to reinstate compul-
sory religious services at any-
time they wished.

However, he said that the
action of the trustees re-
moved the idea that the re-
instatement of such services
is any sort of threat hanging
over the students.

Ford Grant
‘First Step
To Destiny’

Davidson's Ford Founda
tion Challenge Campaign,
just announced a_ success,
began in 1961 when the Ford
Foundation earmarked $100
million of its resources to
help leading independent lib.
eral arts colleges in the Unit-
ed States.

So stringent were the re-
quirements for qualification
that only five liberal arts col-
leges in the South had been
awarded a Ford challenge
grant in 1965. Davidson wac
one of the five.

“The Ford Challenge grant
comes at a particularly op-
portune time,’ President D.
Grier Martin said in June.
1965, “‘because Davidson has
just finished an intensive and
comprehensive study of what
it must do if it is to fulfill its
goal to become the best pos-
sible liberal arts college for
men.”

The Ford Challenge grant
is the first step in David-
son's ‘Decade of Destiny”
program. which has as its
goal the raising of $25,300.
000 over a 10-year period. .

To be eligible for a chal.
lenge grant from the Ford
Foundation, a college had to
exhibit a “tradition of schol-
arship, plans and ability to
make pace-setting improve-
ments, high quality leader-
ship. strong support from
alumni and other sources,
and a well-developed plan for
the improvement of educa-
tion."

In addition, each grant had
several conditions. For ev-

Davidson Meets Ford's Challenge, Turns
Attention To Plans For $2 Million Library

1970 Target Date Set
To Match Little’s Gift

A challenge of $500,000 has
been made to Davidson Col
lege by Edward H. Little of
New York City if the school
will raise an additional
$1,500,000. for a $2 million 1i-
brary/learning center here.

President D. Grier Martin
this afternoon announced the
gift by Little. former chair
man of Davidson’s Board of
Visitors and former chairman
of the board of the Colgate-
Palmolive Company, only.
hours after it.was announced
that Davidson's Ford Foun:
dation Challenge Campaign
goal had been met.

The trustees immediately
began mapping plans to de-
termine the structure
of the new library/learning
center so that construction
could begin as soon as suf.
ficient. contributions are re
ceived.

Fraternity Compromise
Finds Trustees’ Favor

The Board of Trustees to
day passed the Davidson fra-
ternity presidents’ proposal
for an extended rush pro
gram as a. solution to the
fraternity affiliation pro
blem. The plan will go into
effect in February.

The proposa! had been en-
dorsed by the faculty and by
national representatives of

{ four of Davidson's fraterni
~ ties earlier this week.

The compromise solution is
,an extended rush program
for those not receiving bids
during the formal rushing
period. Only those who do
not receive bids are eligible.
Such a rushee would be al.
lowed to participate in the
fraternities social activities
for two months.

If either the fraternity or

the rushee is not satisfied

with the relationship. then the
rushee is issued another in-
vitation.
The program will be up
for review by the IFC and
the fraternity

ing financial pinch that Da
vidson and other private col-

He estimated it would take
at least $1.5 million. to fund
the initial steps of the pro-
gram and added:

“We have finally faced up
to the tragic news that we as
a small private college could
perhaps not manage this at
this time.” .

If the college is unable to
put the program into effect
by next year, as originally
planned, then it will aim for
implementation in the fall of
1969. Martin said.

According to Bill Bondu-
rant, assistant to the presi-
dent, the trustees are to have
a called meeting to approve
the program when the Presi-
dent and Finance Committee
decide that resources are
available.

The curriculum proposals
it released in May included

calendar. discontinuation of
compulsory ROTC, the estab-
lishment of an honors college
and introduction of achieve-
ment examinations at the end
of the sophomore year.

The trustees’ decision today
is not final, Martin said, ‘‘but
it is an indication that the
program won't get going in
the coming year.

“We felt that we would be
negligent in not taking a wait-
and-see attitude.”

Martin said that while the
trustees agreed in principle
with the proposal's major
planks, they held small reser-
vations concerning some of
the details.

with Davidson fraternity

Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Sigma Nu.

The general feeling of the
national representatives at
the conclusion of the meeting
was one of satisfaction con-
cerning the proposal. One
representative. Dick Fletcher,
executive secretary of Sigma
Nu, speaking as a unofficial
spokesman for the group.
said, "All of our questions
have been answered."

SENIORS

“We hope to be able to start
the Wbrary/learning center
by 1970," Martin stated.

“This splendid and gener
ous gift. coming from one of
Davidson's most. loyal friends
and devoted benefactors, will
be an integral part of our
‘Decade of Destiny’ pro

tories and the Cunningham

Both the library funds and
the Ford Foundation funds
are major parts of David
son's “Decade of Destiny”
program, begun in 1965. Prev.
ious studies had found that
the college would need to
raise $25,300,000 during 1965
1975 to be able “to provide
an educatinoal program sec
ond to none. to double its en-

ing. to acquire and hold the

Martin noted.

Little was born on a Meck-
lenburg County farm not far
from Davidson and as a youth
began selling soap products.
By 1930 he had become presi-
dent and chief executive of.-
ficer and by 1953 chairman
of the board and chief execu-
tive officer of Colgate Pal
molive Company.

Responsible for many in
novations in the company’s
growth, he developed its po
tential to serve many foreign
countries as well. He retired
from the company in 1961.

Manor Is
New Site
Of Library |

The new E. H. Little Li-
brary will be located at the
present Lingle Manor site.

That location was accepted
today by the Board of Trus-
tees, which approved the rec-
‘onimendation of its Buildings
and Grounds Committee by
a nearly unanimous vote.

*We're glad to have that
decision made." said Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin. .“We
have walked and walked and
walked around the campus
over the last year trying to
decide on this thing.”

The trustees’ decision cli-
maxed several months of dis-
cussion, speculation and hag-
gling over the site.

A number of locations had
been mentioned. but Martin
said the trustees felt the
Lingle Manor site was the
best.

“There is plenty of parking
space, no trees that will have
to be cut down and it's con-
venient for the students,’’ he
said.

Also considered by the
Board were a site across Con-
cord Road and a site in front
of the Guest House and Watts
and Little Dormitories.

The Concord Road site had
been openly favored by the
student body and the library
staff. In a poll last spring.
506 students indicated they
preferred that site. Only 47
put the Lingle :Manor site
first.
