Dennis Phillips
Splashes Way To
Cake Race Win

The annual Freshman Cake
Race was run last Monday, with
Dennis Phillips the winner.

Cakes, which had been baked
by the wives of the faculty and
administration, were presented
to the first 52 freshmen to cross
the finish line.

Despite a slight drizzle, Phil-
lips ran the 1.7-mile course in
what Coach Heath Whittle de-
scribed as ‘“‘a real good time”—
9:54.5.

Phillips was followed — by
Chester Davis and Leonard Heff-
ner in second and third places,
respectively. These men are at
present members of the frosh
cross-country team.

LOCALS SEEK REVENGE AT GREENVILLE

’Cats i Hit Furman In First Loop

“Best Club In Conference’’---
Dole Rates Purple Paladins

Tomorrow the Davidson Wildcats meet their first

conference foe when they

|clash head-on with the Furman Paladins at Greenville, S. C., at 2 p.m.
In an interview, Wildcat Coach Bill Dole expressed great admiration for the

| Paladins. ‘“‘They have speed and size, and having lost very few

layers from last

year's team, they also have much valuable experience. I believe that they have the

st club in the conference.”

DAVIDSON’S BIG NAME COACH

DAVIDSON’S NEWEST addition to the coaching de- |
partment is quite a guy if past records mean anything.

We're talking about Mr. Harry Fogelman, who suc-
ceeds Dr. Paul Marrotte as head soccer coach this fall|
and Semi Mintz as head tennis mentor.

Fogelman comes to our little Utopia, where head}
coaches are not chased off with a shotgun or hung in
effigy by victory-thirsty students, from the University of
Cincinnati, of Oscar Robertson fame.

It seems that this ro-
tund gentleman, who looks
like anything but a tennis
coach, compiled quite a rec-
ord at Cincy. Last spring he
brought his highly-touted

Bearcats to Davidson for a
-match in which we were
thoroughly out-matched.

Evidently, though, Mr.
Fogelman liked our Caro-
lina climate and scenery so
i much that he wanted to re-
‘turn. Naturally, we jumped a
_at the chance to get a big ;
/ name coach -2re. FOGELMAN

Dr. Tom Scott says of Fogelman: “He has probably

| turned out more of the top young tennis players in the

, country today than any other college coach.”

i It’s rumored that the newcomer likes his new sur-,

roundings so well that he wants to stay for quite some-
time. If that be the case, Davidson should be Southern
| Conference tennis kingpin for quite sometime.

Five of the top high school netters in the country
| are supposedly headed our way next year. That’s right—
'we don’t give tennis scholarships.

Says one current Wildcat netter: “Top young tennis
prospects all over the country have heard of Mr. Fogel-
man, and they will be jumping at the chance to play
j} under him.”

Welcome, Harry Fogelman, welcome!

‘CATS WILL BE COLOR BLIND

DAVIDSON FOOTBALL PLAYERS will be seeing
‘red instead of purple when they look at Furman’s uni-
‘forms tomorrow. And just like the famous bull, the Wild-
i will be charging at that red with everything they
ave.
| If a Davidson team has ever been “up” for a game,
‘it has to be this one. Coach Dole has so much propaganda
\with which to fire his men up, even we start burning just
\thinking about it.
| “To begin with, anyone who saw the Furman fiasco
\here last year should still be hopping mad. Davidson out-
‘rushed, out-passed, out-hustled, out-scrapped, out-every-
thing but out-score the Paladins. An intercepted pass and
a 78-yard pass play in the last five minutes of play pulled
the visitors from sure defeat to victory.
In addition, Furman is regarded as the best offensive
team in the conference with us tops defensively. These
two opposite forces should provide an interesting day.
Finally, the Paladins have been tabbed by most
regional sportswriters as the team to beat this year. Dole’s
ee believe they’re the team that can beat the team to
at.

MORE CRYSTAL GAZING
