CHARLES GRAVES VARDELL.

Was Graduated From Davidson
With Class of '88.

Charles Graves Vardell, '88, was born
in Charleston, S. C., February 12, 1860.
Owing to unsettled conditions after the
Civil War, he had very few educational
opportunities and at quite an early age
went to work; first on the family plan-
tation, then on the phosphate fields of
South Carolina.

At the early age of 19 he entered
United States Government service as
superintendent of
Farm, Summerville, S.C. In his twenty-
first year he went to Minnesota. There

It was in 1896 that he was called to be
the head of the newly organized Red
Springs Seminary, a school for young
women.. The development of this school
has been one of the interesting stories
of the growth of woman's educa-
tion in North Carolina. This school has
a present enrollment of 310 with a fac-
ulty of 39; property, lands and buildings
valued at more than $400,000, and an en-
dowment of $160,000. About 3,000 young
women have had the advantages of the
institution. In 1901, Davidson College
conferred upon him the degree of Doctor
of Divinity. He is still president of this
college (now Flora Macdonald College),
the leading Presbyterian college for
women in the South. Dr. and Mrs. Var-
dell have been blessed with six chil-
dren, one boy and five girls.
