Clark battles

town council

By NELLE McCORKLE

Davidson town Board of Ad-
justment and Review denied Tom
Clark’s. request for an extension
on a zoning amendment which
would allow to him to continue
operation of a.salesroom in his
Grey Road studio in the: board’s
Dec. 16 meeting.

Enforcement of the ordinance
halted Clark’s sale of his gnome

statues at his studio Dec. 31. The ©

ordinance prohibits operation of

most types of businesses on resi- «

dential sites.
Clark can appeal the. board’s
decision to Mecklenburg County

- Superior Court but said Wednes-

day he does not plan to do so.
Three members of the fiye-

member “board voted against

Clark’s -extension request; one

member voted in favor of the re-
quest; board chairman William
Ward abstained. ‘

Appointed by the Board of
Commissioners, these Adjust-
ment and Review Board members
denied Clark’s request following a
public hearing held the previous
week at which Clark’s neighbors,
employees and business as-
sociates testified: The board’s de-
cision arose not from testimony
but from a vote following exami-
nation of local ordinances, ac-
cording to board member and
Sociology/Anthropology Profes-
sor Bob Ruth.

_ Kreps discusses international economic policy

By TOM MOORE
Former Secretary of Com-
merce Juanita Kreps worries
about the trade deficit. In her talk,
“Domestic Policy Making in a
Global Hemisphere,” before 250
people Wednesday night in Love
Auditorium,. she — discussed
Japan’s status in the global
economy in comparison to our
own. Se
“The Japanese, we think, save
too much and consume too little.
Japanese savings have. enabled
that nation to become the world’s
major lender, while the U.S. has
achieved the dubious position as
the world’s greatest borrower,”
she said.
“As foreign capital flows into

the United States, in contrast to ...

the situation only a few years ago,
when we were the world’s largest
creditor, we are now financing
about $100 billion of our annual
federal deficit with foreign
funds,” said Kreps, who is -cur-
rently vice president and James B.
Duke professor of Economics at
Duke University. She was the first
woman on the board of the New
York Stock Exchange, and also

serves as a trustee of the Duke En-
dowment.

- An issue central to the prob-
lem is a continuing nationalistic
mindset in economics. The di-
lemma is confronting economic
problems that are not national, but
global in scope. The trick, she
said, is learning to apply existing
policy tools to the world
economy. "ad

“A current concern is about
slowing growth rates,” Kreps
said. The U.S. is trying to get Ger-

many and Japan to boost their ©

economies, but they have been re-
luctant to do so. “The Germans
blame the problem on heavy
spending by government and con-
sumers” in the United States.

Kreps gave a short history of
the current situation. “We undere-
stimate the impact of change and
discuss policy as though we were
a well nation.” Oil embargoes of
the 1970's did heavy if not irrepar-
able. damage to the nation’s
economy, she said.

Also, she said, “Shifts in our
trade position are symptomatic of
changes not just in the U.S.
economy, but in the economies

around the world. A few months
ago a corporate economist drew
some parallels between now and
the 1930's.

“He noted that in both cases
we “witnessed severe exchange
misalignment, falling commodity
prices, serious international debt
problems, severe agricultural dis-
tress in the United States and
threats of retaliation against any
trade legislation imposed. But, he
noted, there are differences be-
tween now and 1930.

“Japan is now in the position
of the U.S. in 1930, and the U.S.
is in the position of Great Britain
in 1930. ..

“It’s an oversimplification,”
Kreps said, “but it leaves some
gnawing doubts about the future
of the U.S. trade position.”

She recalled the FBI expose of
Japanese theft of IBM secrets.
“We don’t know whether to laugh
or to-cry; cry because it hurts our
relations, or laugh because even
with their trade surplus they want
our technology. We misinterpret
Japan’s motives for economic
success, she said. They drive to

succeed not to raise their material

level, as.does the United States,

but to gain self sufficiency.”

Kreps lamented the falling
reputation of economists and
explained that although
economists’ stock went way up
during the Johnson Administra-
tion when their suggested tax cut
performed as planned, “we now
have to explain why Reagan’s has
‘not been equally effective.

“We have foolishly entered
into policy making, as politicians
now do economics. We have been
charged with failing to foresee and
prevent inflation and unemploy-
ment.” ;

In his introduction of Kreps,
Davidson economics professor
Charles Ratliff noted her member-
ship on the board of RJ Reynolds/
Nabisco, which met in Winston-
Salem today to decide whether or
not to move the corporation’s
headquarters to Atlanta. Kreps put
her head in her hands at the men-
tion and gave an exaggerated dis-
play of her apparent distaste at
having to make the decision.

Kreps blasted the 1986 tax re-

form plan.of the Reagan Adminis-
tration. “Should the United States
encourage the thrifty Japanese and
other investors from around the
world to acquire U.S. debt and
private property, or should we in-
voke domestic policies that would
discourage consumption in this
country and encourage savings?

“If it’s the latter,” she said, “if
it’s savings we want, the 1986 tax
reform moved us in quite the
wrong direction.

“In contrast to earlier periods

of recession, where increased

consumer spending was necessary
to'stimulate the economy, now is a
time to increase savings and in-
vestment.”

She quoted one economist
who in turn quoted Ecclesiastes:
“For everything there is a season,
a time for every matter under the
sun, a free translation of which, he-
says, would lower interest rates,
improve competitiveness: ~ and
work closely with other nations
for our collective growth.

“Great harm can result from
pursuing once-ripe policies in the
