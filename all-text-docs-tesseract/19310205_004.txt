“Florida West Coast

Alumni Have Dinner

At the time of going to press, only one
report had been received by the alumni sec-
retary on the two local chapter dinner-meet-
ings held in Florida last week, at which Dr.
Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson,
was guest of honor. This was the meeting
at Tampa on Friday night, which inctuded
Davidson alumni on the west coast of Flor-
ida.

Officers chosen for the ensuing year were
Chas. G. Baskerville, '28, Tampa, president;
C. R. Anderson, ’27, St. Petersburg, vice-
president, and J. C. Pressley, '26, St. Peters-
burg, secretary.

To quote from a letter sent by the re-
tiring secretary anent the meeting:

“We had quite a pleasant meeting of the
alumni chapter here last night. We. enjoyed
very much having Dr. Lingle here and can
assure you that his remarks were well re-
ceived by the whole group. Dr. Lingle talked
especially on the new plan of equipping the
library, stating that it was one of David-
son’s greatest needs now.

“The organization discussed both pro and
con the question of compulsory church at-
tendance and also dancing within the limits
of Davidson College. Dr. Lingle discussed
it very liberally, admitting there were two
sides to both questions. The discussion was
helped by having with us the Presbyterian
pastors in Tampa, who were our guests also
at the meeting.”

Dr. J, Frank Cranford, ‘06, retiring presi-
dent of the chapter, was unable to attend,
and wired his regrets. In addition to the
Tampa ministers, alumni present included
J. G. Anderson, '06, Tampa; T. M. Towry,
Jr., 22, and R. J. Knight, ’22, both of Safety

Some men say amusing things about color in shirts and shorts
—but no one questions the unusual comfort in this two-piece
HANES. We’ve taken track-athlete free-
dom and enlarged on it a bit for men who’ve dropped their
calisthenics, but who love comfort none the less. We are a little
tickled, too, that we can match the weird colors in your ties, your
shirts, and your socks—though there is pure white, of course.
