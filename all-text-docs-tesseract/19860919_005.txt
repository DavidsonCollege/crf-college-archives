"Jagged Edge parallels Hitchcock thriller

By MARK CHEN

Jagged Edge is a movie that
ought to please lovers of that arch-
con, Alfred Hitchcock. It is the
kind of movie that critics never
like but at which Hitchcock excel-
led in directing — the slick,
well-made, and smoothly turing -
thriller. All the parts are in the
right place, everything happens
on time, and the plot twists just
enough to be surprising without
being too confusing. For though
the twists are many, they are all
conventional twists taken from the
cliches of Hollywood thrillers
gone before. This kind of movie is
designed forthe person who wants
something a little more classy than.
James Bond, but just as trashy.

‘one lawyer, who hasn't been
around very long, played by
Glenn Close. She refuses to take
the case until driven to be the in-
nocence of her client and the arro-
gance of the DA. Seems Coyote
happens to be running for the Sen-
- ate‘and would love to prosecute a
rich nfan in a media-saturated
case. Once she decides to take the
case (did"’ you think she
wouldn’t?), the stage is set.

I'm not going to spoil the
movie by telling you what hap-
pens, but I will tell you what’s in
the movie. First off, sex. Close is
frigid at the beginning, but
Bridges shows off some very firm
pectorals. She eventually gets
warmed up to him. For those of

The plot begins in typical , you who like sex with a special

Hitchcock fashion, with some-
thing horrible. In this case it is the
brutal murder of a _ wealthy
woman. Wouldn’t you know it,
but her will reveals that she léft all
her wealth to her husband, which
happens to include the newspaper
at which he is the editor. The dis-
trict attorney, played by Peter
Coyote, makes the brilliant de-
duction that he killed his spouse in
order to inherit the paper. The in-
nocent(?) husband, played by Jeff
Bridges, gets arrested for the mur-
der of his wife. At this point in real
life Jeff Bridges would hire a bat-
tery of lawyers from New York

oomph, there are some very de-
tailed stories about bondage. Sec-
ond, blood. Not enough to please
a devotee of The Texas Chainsaw

Massacre, but hey! This is a classy
movie. Third, money. Everybody

is well-dressed and lives in well-
furnished homes, even the besot-
ted but efficient and lovable gum-

the law.

But this is a movie, and a bat-
tery. of lawyers is no fun. Instead

examination of the defense. New
witnesses get sprung on the de-
fense and the prosecution just
when things seem to be going their
way. We even get a dramatic
courtroom confession. Perry
Mason would love it.

The break:

Everything in the movie is old
hat to a-watcher of Hitchcock, but
it‘is well done. Glenn Close looks
a little like Grace Kelly, but in the
Eighties she plays the role of
Jimmy Stewart, the hapless inno-
cent in a world full of terrors.
Making a woman the central char-
acter is one of the few departures
from Hitchcock. In her role.Close
doés well as the competent lawyer
who is slightly stupid about evil.
Jeff Bridges has the all-American
look of stewart, but he plays the
ambiguous role of the guilty-look-
ing defendant. He manages to
look sneaky even when he
sheepishly grins. Coyote fits his
part as the menacing DA, never
smiling except with wicked satis-
faction. The movie itself looks
like a Hitchcock thriller. It is shot
with the pale craftsmanship of:
Hitchcock, when all‘the colors are
bright but they all look.chilly. The
movie works like a smoothly run-
ning time-bomb, all set to ex-
plode.

When this movie first came .

out, many critics faulted it for a

number of things. They said it was

shallow, artificial, and cliched.

The critics were absolutely right.

Lawyers preparing for a tough
case do not have all the time in the
world for horseback riding or
making love’ with their clients.
They also do. not have nervous
breakdowns trying to figure out if
their clients are innocent (This is
not an anti-lawyer sentiment. I
plan to be one myself). Most trials
are incredibly slow and boring af-
fairs. All DAs so not run for pub-

lic office.

I have a quibble myself. For —

one thing, Jaclyn Smith would

have fit better into the Glenn
Close role. Smith has already
played a lawyer in Sidney Sheldon
movies.

Besides that, the movie does
what it is supposed to do, which is
entertain. If anyone wishes to

The new adventurers of G.I. Joe

By STEVE MANK

One of the peculiar side effects of
growing up in the open minded, free-spi-
rited, androgynous 1960s was the new
toys we got.

While my father “persyjaded” count-
less prisoners of war to build erector set
bridges over the river Kwat, my own
childhood centered around a doll.

It wasn’t a doll of the baby variety
like my mother used to drag by the hair
around the house. No, my doll had a crew
cut, a deep facial scar, and combat boots.
He and all his buddies were called G.I.
Joe: a perplexing title which brought on,
in my fifth year, an epiphany regarding
the real army’s use of surnames. Each
holiday I received a package containing
some fancy new duds in olive drab and an
uzi or two. Just like the real army, all his

-—| —clothes looked the.same. Unlike the real

army, however, all his brass knuckles

- and knives and guns and grenades and

mines and missile launchers and napalm
disappeared. Being a compassionate
commanding officer, I chose jnof to be-
lieve the weapons had fallen into the
hands of a filthy nine-inch commie mag-
got and therefore did not discharge him.

Instead, I poured honey into his “life-like
hair” and buried him up to his neck in an
ant pile.

Emily, who liv
from me, also had a/nev kind of doll. In
lieu. of a bald head, fat limbs and a bottle
sucking mouth, Barbie had silky hair,

‘lithe jegs, cherry lips, and get this,

breasts. Sure they may have.been little
more than pink, plastic lumps, but I
‘didn’t even realize they were wrong until

I saw those horrific multicolored dia-

grams in my seventh grade biology book.
Joe had some lumps of his own.

Emily used to tty and get me to play
with her Ken, but he was too wimpy. He
used to take Barbie to balls'and boring
stuff like that; But the scenarios we
created between Barbie and G.I. Joe
were riveting:

Joe: (Invariably) Honey, Pmhome.  ~*
Barbie: Oh hi honey. What did you do
today. ;

Joe: I stuck bamboo slivers under the
thumbnails of an, evil ‘perpetrator of the
Red Threat. What did you do in the Oval
Office?

Barbie: I made a law so that kids are 2 the
bosses.

down the street .

Joe: Neato.,

Barbie: Let’s take our clothes off.

Joe: Okay, you first.

Barbie: No, you first.

Joe: Well, let’s do it together. (They strip
down to their lumps).(Long pause)
Barbie: That was fun.

Joe: Yea.

Barbie: Well, I better go make more

laws. (She dresses and ‘eaves as Joe
polishes his tank.)

This tableau repeated-itself time and

tered champion of the American Way had’
gathered around him a fierce band of
freedom fighters and an arsenal of super
tanks, helicopters, and headquarters. .
Worst of all, his clothes, now plastic,
were permanently molded onto his sol-
dier’s skin.

Barbie: Yes.

Joe: It’s me, G.I. Joe.

no more. Suddenly, the toy stores were
bankrupt of his stony visage. Meanwhile,
Barbie grew more sophisticated. She tan-
ned at Malibu, relaxed in a penthouse,
and traveled in a very well stock
jet. Barbie enjoyed life to the hilt not re-

‘membering her lover Joe who was either

dead or dying i in the vengeful tortuous
clutches of the \pinko swine.

But not long ago Joe resurfaced a de-
cidedly changed man. The most notice-
able difference was his height, Presuma-
bly, through some evil experiment,-he
was rendered a mere five inch shadow of
his former self. What's, more, the embit-

Lear.

Barbie: Fine, I’m Secretary General of
the United Nations now.

Joe: Oh, I’m an embittered champion of
the American Way. ,
Barbie: Hm .

Joe: I was wondering if .

Barbie: Listen Joe, [better leave. Ihave a_
date with Ken. \F

Joe: Couldn't we at least strip down to
our lumps?

Barbie: I’m sorry. Bye.

Joe: Bye.

away.)
