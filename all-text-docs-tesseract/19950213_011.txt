Pearl Jam’s Vitalogy
a mixed bag

New album doesn’t quite measure up to Vs.

By Racue, NEwcomsB

I’ve been putting off review-
ing Pearl Jam’s new album Vitalogy
for some time.

In the months before it came,
out, I couldn’t have been more
excited. Remembering how much
I liked their last album, Vs. , I
bombarded the local record store
with calls demanding to know the
exact release date. And when it
came out, I was there.

Expectation quickly led to dis-
appointment. The album isn’t
awful, but I can’t say I like it all
that much either. It has its strong
moments, but the record itself does
not seem infused with the same
energy of their last two. While the
press (whom lead singer Eddie
Vedder constantly vilifies in his
lyrics and interviews) seemed to
unanimously praise this album, I
have to disagree. -

In its favor, the packaging is
quite unique. Made of all recy-
clable, earth-friendly materials, the
thin cardboard package contains a
miniature book of quaint, oldnews-
paper clippings with headlines like:
“Why Strong Men Die Young”
and “Lecture to Girls and Young
Women.” But let’s forget about
how interesting the CD casing is
and get to the album.

“Last Exit,” the first cut on the
album, is all right --the lyrics aren’t
all that interesting, but the
drumwork is forceful, and the song
has a good beat. Since picking up
former Jane’s Addiction drummer
Dave Navarro, Pearl Jam’s drum-
ming groundwork has taken on a
more insistent, uncompromising
stance. “Spin the Black Circle” is
one of those loud, relentless Pearl

shifter, and a wah pedal. These
gave him access to a range of
sounds which he used liberally.

Of course, the sound would
mean nothing if the playing wasn’t
good, but Jimmy made sure there
was no doubt about his abilities.
His playing’ ranged from a raw
growl to a clean, quiet plucking
with only a sprinkle of volume, so
all that was heard was the acoustic
sound of the metal strings smack-
ing against their dormant pickups.

The whole experience was
more than incredible both musi-
cally and visually, andif you missed
it, ’m sorry. Jimmy Thackery and
the Drivers was one of the best
bands I’ve seen in the 900 Room to
date. After the great show I de-
cided to forgive them for their
clothes.

Recycle.

Jam songs that seems to make its
appearance on every album. It
sounds like punk, and it’s not hard
to imagine the band playing this
and diving into the audience or
smashing their instruments.

I like the third song, “Not For
You.” Against a steady backdrop
of a strong guitar riff and drums,
Vedder engages in one of his tor-
tured, man-against-the-world
monologues, his voice fairly drip-
ping withrage and discontent. And
“Better Man” is one of Pearl Jam’s
finer moments. As he did in
“Daughter” on their last album,
Vedder seems consistently able to
narrate sympathetic and interest-
ing vignettes about women. In
“Better Man,” he tells the story of
a woman stuck in an abusive rela-
tionship. It starts slowly, building
to the melodious chorus: “She lies
and says she’s in love with him/
Can’tfinda better man/ She dreams
in color she dreams in red.”

“Aye Davanita,” a self-pro-
claimed “song without words,” isa
fairly short, interesting instrumen-
tal. “Immortality” is also a good
cut--interesting lyrics, a slow,
steady beat, and dark guitars.

My objection to this album is
that there’s nothing on it which
makes me want to listen to it over
and over the way I did with Vs.
While there are very good mo-
ments, there are no absolutely

breathtaking ones, no songs that
astound me the way “Dissident”
did, or “Elderly Woman Behind A
Counter (In A Small Town).” A
few months prior to this album’s
release, the radio kept playing a -
Pearl Jam single called “Yellow
Ledbetter,” which I had hoped
would be on this CD. It was amaz-
ing--and it’s not on this record.
Instead, we have throwaways like
the paranoid and annoying “Bugs,”
and the disjointed, anarchic con-
versation-with-music at the end of
the album.

Despite their feigned insis-
tence on remaining a band without
a leader, Pearl. Jam has definitely
moved Eddie Vedder to the helm.
If his vision is the same as that of
his other band members, fine, but
many of the songs on this album
seem to reflect the themes and con-
cerns I’ve heard him bring up in
interviews. Vedder continues to
sing about the same issues, but ina
way that is just not as interesting as
it was on Vs.

For another band, Vitalogy
would have been a great album,
and for Pearl Jam, it’s really not
bad. But they are capable of more,
and I would have liked to see that
come through on this record.

Boys on the Side. Only some playboy marketing
executive could have chosen this title. It makes me
embarrassed to have seen this movie. What does it
mean? That Whoopi Goldberg, Drew Barrymore,
and Mary Louise Parker are usually women, but
metamorphosize into men when no one’s looking?

. Anyway. Boys on the Side is an almost shame-
less tribute to Fried Green Tomatoes and Thelma &
Louise, but with an ultra-contemporary twist. All the
elements are there: the bonding road trip, fleeing a
violent male, setting up house together, and the fatal
disease that sets up the poignant farewell. Mary

Louise Parker plays the “whitest woman in the
world” who hires an unemployed lounge: singer
(Whoopi Goldberg) to help her drive cross-country.
En route, they pick up Drew Barrymore — who
plays, basically, herself. With great enthusiasm.
Surprisingly enough, she rescues this movie
from being just another tear-jerker about unre-
quited love and death-bed reconciliation. Whoopi,
unfortunately, gets carried away on the wave of her
musical success in Sister Act and serenades her way
through hits of the late 70s. But Mary Louise Parker
(Fried Green Tomatoes, Grand Canyon, Short Cuts)
gives another solid and underappreciated perfor-
mance that makes this film bearable. Is there any
higher praise for a movie called Boys on the Side?
