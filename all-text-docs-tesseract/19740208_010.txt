imagination.’’
Who knows Louie Mills
stories?

Whispered on the wind, the
rumors fly. Wednesday is
Louie Mills night. Did he or

did he not flip the bird to the
crowd? Did he or did he not
say to the Wildcat on first
shaking hands, ‘Eat shit, Ben-
der’? No one knows for sure.
So the night of the Richmond
game (Yes, Virginia, there is
a Richmond), I wait to see the
legend. In he walks to a stan-
ding ovation from the David-
son crowd. Majestic? Hardly.
t? Not noticeable.
Wrathful? He had a pontificial
smile on. Bald? Well, yes, but
that doesn't mean much.

Taking my courage in both
hands, I approach the legend,
tap him on the shoulder, and
ask for an interview. ‘‘Could I
talk to you after the game for
after the game for THE
DAVIDSONIAN, Coach
Mills?’’ ‘‘Certainly, dear’’
said the legend. Hmmm. A
legend who calls me ‘dear’.
This enigma calls out for fur-
ther investigation.

All through the game, | kept
tabs on Louie’s reactions. One
technical was called on the
Richmond bench in each half.
The second ‘T’ came after an
Academy award winning per-
formance and a trip the length
of the court with all the
dramatic stalking of Richard

Burton playing ‘‘Hamlet’’. In
response to the catcalls and
applause from the Davidson
gentlepersons (reminded of
their manners prior to the
game) Louie only smiled.

After the game, I waited for
Louie outside the locker room.
I was a little nervous. After
all, Louie is a legend. He has a
famous temper. He might pun-
ch me out.

He came out. ‘‘Hello dear,”
said the legend. From there
the interview went downhill.
Louie beamed. He enjoys the
response he gets from David-
son students. I asked him if he
played up his reactions to bad
calls to solicit crowd reaction.
Did he punch me out? No. He
told me that he would never do
anything to hurt his team.

I told him he was a figment of
Davidson’s imagination. Did
he get mad? No. he laughed.
“That’s probably true,” he
said. He said he doesn’t par-
ticularly enjoy coming to
Davidson, because his team
loses a lot here. He said that
Davidson students give him
the best audience/reception of
any group Richmond plays.

Louie said, “You have a
good ball team.’’ He patted me

Irish Rally To Preserve Win
As Cats Refuse To Lie Down

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Someone who watched
Notre Dame play last Satur-
day against Davidson could
ask how did that team beat
U.C.L.A.?

For the first few minutes of
the first half, Davidson took
a 12-7 lead despite shooting
poorly.

However, later in the half
the Irish ran a string of 10
unanswered points together to
take command. The teams
went into the locker rooms
with Notre Dame up 13, 45-32.
Balanced scoring by Notre
Dame was led by Gary
Brokaw and John Shumate.

when the time had run out
there was a rebound foul on T.
J. Pecorak. It was fitting to
see the biggest hot dog in
college sports, John Shumate
go to the line and increase the
margin of victory from a
measily nine to double figures.
John Shumate, who had
never impressed me as the
ketchup and mustard type
before the game, really
showed it in this game. After
being knocked down while
down the lane the Shu
sat on the court for at least one
minute just pulling up his
socks. When he stood back up
he received a good ovation
from the otherwise quiet
crowd and started laughing

Gary Novak (avg. 5.7 ppg)
and Dwight Clay (8.7 ppg) had
17 and 19 respectively. Clay
who is shooting just under 42
nercent on the vear was 9-13
and six in_ the. second half.
Novak was seven for eight
from the field.

For the Cats this game
marked the return of John
Falconi who had missed the
last seven games. He saw
spot-duty action and had six
points.

T. J. Pecorak had his best

six and had four rebounds to
score his game total of twelve
points.

The leading scorers in the
game were Brokaw and
Shumate who had 24 and 26.
The Cats were led by Larry
Horowitz who started slowly
but ended with 18. Davidson
had four men in double figures
despite the Witz, they were
Dunn with 16 and Powell,
Sheldon Parker and Pecorak
with 12.

Davidson had more field
goals and more Catholics than
did Notre Dame but neither of
these factors seemed to help.
The Praying Irish were 21-32
from the line while the Cats
could manage only ten at-
tempts from the charity stripe
making eight.
