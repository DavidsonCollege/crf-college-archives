AN ANALYSIS
” By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

ED. NOTE: This. is the
third in a series of four
articles on ‘Fraternities In
Crisis.”

As an American institu-
tion, the college fraternity
has displayed an amazing
resilience. Created as a
tightly-knit Christian fellow-
ship to fill the social and
emotional void of college
life, it has become a staple
of campus life for hundreds
of colleges and universities
across the nation.

Recently, however, the
tide has begun to. turn
Strongly against. the nation-

al fraternities on college
‘campuses, and by all indi-
‘cations this *anti-fraternity

movement sweeping the na-
tion is still far from _ its
peak.

Parade Magazine was one
of the first official publica-

tions to recognize it when
three years ago an article
| appearing on its pages stat-
ed that the national frater-

nity system, as it presently °

Stands, will not be either
necessary or desirable in a
very few years.

Other sources have begun
studying the situation, and
most have come to the con
clusions that the present
fraternity system is indeed
going to have to accept sev-
eral very basic and radical
changes or else pass from
the’ college campus.

Already a great many
Campuses have’ witnessed
the death of their fraternity
systems. Throughout the

nities have either never got-
ten a foothold on campus or

_ ty. discrimination,

leading campuses are going
through fraternity transition
periods.

Only in the Midwest and
the South, where ritual and
tradition. still. have great
meaning to many students,
are fraternities not dying by
any drastic measures.

There are a great many
reasons behind this demise
of national fraternities that
is growing more and more
rapidly each school year.

Foremost in the list of
anti-fraternity grievances is
the racial and religious dis-
criminatory policies of
many, if not. most of the
national fraternities.

Time Magazine in 1966
pointed, out that racial ex
clusion by fraternities, be-
being illegal, was
causing many student liber-
als to shun pledging the se-
lective groups and to take
the cause of the anti-frater-
nity forces.

Another complaint
cerning fraternities,
closely related” to

sides

con-
and one
fraterni
has been
the means of selection used
by fraternities, most com-
monly the Hlackball system.
“Fraternities can rational-
ize and apologize forever,"
Jerome Rodnitzsky, a_psy-
chologist, wrote. in School
and Society, but in act-
uality the ability of one
member to enact his secret
prejudicies will perpetuate
discrimination and rejection

practices within the frater
nity system." ,
In other words, despite

arguments to the contrary,
the national fraternity is no
longer as influential an ele-
ment on college campuses
across the nation as it once
was. It is, rather, a_rising
power in lesser schools,
and a dying or dead force
in most of the nation's lead-
ing educational institutions.

The resolution supporting

the Post Office vigil passed
by a vote of 10 to 3. It states:
“We deplore the unwilling-

ful justification and are dan-
gerous to the prospects of
peace both in Asia and in

Spencer also stated that

“There must. be no inter-

“with legitimate activities of

Spencer’s authorization to
lower the college flag ap-
parently ended a free-for-all

dents and the ROTC Wednes-
day morning.

When students lowered the

flag, ROTC cadre raised it
again, and finally locked the
flag at full mast.

When the flag was taken
down at sundown, students
put up another American

flag at half staff, and locked

it in position with a_ pad-

During the night, some

students not sympathetic to
the protests broke the pad-

Failure Problem

By JOHN FINE the legend of corrupt and

gid iad lad obscure the fact that the
problems which the Recon-
striction program attempted
to solve are not yet solved.
The celebration of the

Civil War Centennial, Wood-
ward said, generated little
enthusiasm outside of the

The American conscience
has proven itself unable to
accept failure, said C. Vann
Woodward in his Reynolds
Lecture Wednesday night.
Woodward is Sterling Profes-
sor of History at Yale Uni-

versity. South because it was in fact
Woodward, one of the a celebratios of the legend
country’s leading historians of Reconstruction which ‘ra-

tionalizpd the Compromise
of 1877.

For Northerners, he said,
it was a reminder that Re-
construction had failed and
for Negroes it was a com-
memoration of the event
which led to the forfeit of the
rights they had obtained as
a result of the Civil War.

Early histories of Recon-
struction stressed the inepti-
tude of policy implementa-
tion, Woodward said. They
reached the conclusion that
mores could not be legisla-
ted, a conclusion which was
accepted un¢ritically: by Re-
visionist historians and was
inscribed in legal decisions
as the law of the land.

Two subsequent Revisionist
schools, one imputing base
motives to the proponents of
Reconstruction and another
stressing the positive achieve-

of the South, examined two
outstanding failures — the
Confederacy and the Recon-
struction — in ‘‘Emancipa-
tions and Reconstructions: A
Comparative View,” the first
of two Reynolds Lectures

Thursday morining.

The significance of these
events in the fabric of Ameri-
can thought is evidenced by
the controversy which sur-
rounds the statutes and ju-
dicial decisions of the period,
he said.

In the present . decade,
which has been characteriz-
ed as the Second Reconstruc-

with their allusions to change

Woodward said. They have
