Remembering Dean Rusk

By Mary Laura Moretz
Staff writer

"You will not have many dull
moments in the decades that lie
ahead. I shall not be able to go with
you on that journey, but I have no
doubt about how it is going to
come out. You are going to make
it. In any event you carry with you
the best wishes and the blessings
of an old man.”

So spoke Dean Rusk, Class of
1931, when lasthe visited Davidson
in 1985. On Monday, February
20, the Davidson College commu-
nity will have the chance to cel-
ebrate his memory and give thanks
for his service to his country and

Week

promotes
solidarity

By Mary CLareE JALONICK
News Editor

In conjunction with Black
History Month, the Union has
scheduled Solidarity Week in an
attempt to recognize the diverse
forces that pull the campus, as well
as the country, together.

Speaking for the Solidarity
Committee, Phoebe Dean says that
“instead of focusing on diversity
we are trying to emphasize bring-
ing different groups of people to-
gether.”

From February 10 to 19, Soli-
darity week will include contribu-
tions from all sides of Davidson.
Art displays, performances, speak-
ers, and bands will entertain the
campus.

This year’s theme is “Ameri-
can Graffiti,” for the committee
felt that domestic issues have been
a major concern.

Highlights include Reverend
Percy Reeves’ talk about integra-

his alma mater.

The memorial service will be
held at 4 p.m. in the Davidson
College Presbyterian Church.
President John W. Kuykendall will
lead the service, and the Davidson
College Choir will sing a selection
from Mozart’s Requiem.

Rusk’s son, Richard Rusk, will
also speak at the service. Jack
Perry, Director of the Dean Rusk
Program in International Studies,
will make additional remarks.
Among the hymns will be the Battle
Hymn of the Republic, a favorite of
Rusk’s and one he requested to be
sung at his funeral.

“Weare indebted to Mr. Rusk.
I'dlike to think that the Dean Rusk

Program takes its inspiration from
the kind of person he was,” says
Perry.
According to Perry, when the
college offered to honor Rusk, he
replied, “I don’t want another tomb-
stone, but I’d like a program to
reach the students.”

The members of Rusk Eating
House will sit together at the me-
morial to honor the man for whom
their organization is named.

Rusk President Holly Kledis
says, “We take pride in our name
because of him. He meant a lot to
Davidson, and of course he means
a lot to Rusk House.”

The memorial is open to the
public, and all students are invited.

Solidarity Week
seeks to
cultivate
togetherness
among all
groups in

a diverse
comminuty.

tion and the future of the church, a
“Gator Gumbo” Cajun band, a fo-
rum on affirmative action, counse-
lor Dr. Bob Barrett’s talk about
AIDS, Washington Post colum-
nist William Raspberry’ s talk about
building community, the weekend
women’s retreat, and an all-male a
capella gospel singing group.
Solidarity Week was begun in
1986 by the Union Board in re-

sponse to a Klu Klux Klan march
down Main Street in Davidson.
According to Dean, “The outraged
community started Solidarity Day,
which focused on building com-
munity.” It has since evolved into
a week.

Dean is pleased with the tim-
ing. “We have an AIDS speaker as
a follow up to the Quilt, and
women’s month is March.”

Davidson’s low student-faculty
ratio means that a few extra stu-
dents can make a big difference.
Each extra person equals four ex-
tra classes, so five extra people
would be 20 classes. It is easy to
see how little it takes before a fill-
in professor must be hired,” says
Terry.

Additional students also re-
quire additional housing. Terry is
anxious that, like this year, there
will be another room shortage next
year. This year, although RLO set
aside extra rooms for overflow,
some freshmen roomed in triples.
If the extra rooms are not used,
they will go to upperclassmen on
the waiting list.

Somerising sophomores could
find themselves without housing.
“T don’t want to cause a big scare
here, but it is possible that some
rising sophomores will be forced
off-campus,” says Terry. He ac-
knowledges that due to the hous-
ing crunch, more people will re-
ceive off-campus housing permis-

sion this year than in the past.

RLO must decide right now
which dorms will house freshmen
based on the estimated occupancy.
Terry says,. “It would be great to
know exactly how many freshmen
we have before the upperclassmen
get their rooms.
know about the incoming class until
May, and the other students leave
then. Therefore we have to esti-
mate. What we are facing now isa
cumulative effect. If this year’s
class goes beyond the target, we
mustreplace this year’s senior class
with more students, leaving three
large classes.”

The Classes of ‘95 and ‘96
have around 400 students apiece,
while the Class of ‘97 has 450
students and the Class of ‘98 has
460. The target number for the
classes of °97 and ’98 did not
change, but more people decided
to enroll than expected. Terry cites
Davidson’s number eight ranking

in U.S. News and World Report for ,

part of Davidson’s success. “We
are hotter than ever nationally,” he
says.

Despite the growing number
of applications, Davidson intends
to keep the 1,600 cap on the stu-

dent body, according to Dean of
Admissions Nancy Cable Wells.
Also, she doesn’t see the new fi-
nancial aid restrictions as signifi-
cant to the population. “There
were the same amount of students
who qualify for need in this year’s
class [*98] as in previous years.
This year’s applicant pool
looks more diverse than ever.
Compared to last year, this appli-
cant pool shows a 14 percent in-

‘crease in minority applications,

with the most significant increases
in African-American applications:
52 percent. The numbers for
women and men are almost identi-
cal: 1,513 men and 1,531 women.

Cable Wells says that shewill
"work to bring the best class to
Davidson next year.”

Project Life
appeals to heart

By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff writer”

It’s nearly Valentine’s Day,
and lovers everywhere have com-
pleted (or nearly completed) the
task of finding a gift for their sig-
nificant others.

For a few moments of time on
Valentine’s Day, students can give
the gift of life. On Tuesday only,
between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4
p.m. in the Morrison Room, Red
Cross nurses will be on hand to
accept volunteers for the Project
Life drive.

Students can come during the
designated time period and fill out
afew forms. The nurses will then
take about two tablespoons of blood
to be sent to the National Bone
Marrow Registry to be typed. ~

The results of the typing will
be stored in the registry’s com-
puter bank. Students will be con-
tacted if their type matches a
person’s needing a bone marrow
transplant.

At that time, the donor has the
option whether or notto gothrough
with the operation. Chances that

any individual will match are ex-
tremely rare, and for this reason it
is important that as many as pos-
sible are typed.

In the past four years,
Davidson’s Bone Marrow Drive
has been extremely successful, with
over 1,500 students joining the ef-
fort. When adults and children
suffer from diseases such as
apoastic anemia, leukemia, and
breast cancer, bone marrow trans-
plants are their only hope for sur-
vival.

There is only a one in four
chance that. patients will find a
match within their family. If a
search has to be conducted outside
the family, the probability of find-
ing a match drops to one in 20,000.
The registry is especially in need
of minority samples, which consti-
tute an extremely small percentage
of their data bank.

If civic duty alone doesn’t
convince students to participate,

there’s a chance that Project Life

incentives will. Any freshman hall
with 100 percent participation will
be entered in a raffle to receive a
VCR for their hall.
