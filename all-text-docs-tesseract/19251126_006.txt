Prominent Senior C Chosen to Fill
| Unexpired Term of Frank Hudson

L. L. Deck has been elected to complete
the aiid term of the late Frank Hud-
son as Judge of the Court of Control. F.
Kugler was elected to take the place left
vacant by Deck’s advancement, as one of
the three Senior members of the court.

Deck is one of the prominent men on the

campus. During his Sophomore year he
was chairman of the Sophomore committee
for the Freshman cap burning night. He is
very active in the literary work on the cam-
pus, being a member of the Pandeinic So-
ciety. He was editor and business manager
of the 1925-26 “Y" Handbook, was business
manager of the Davidson College Magazine
last year and is business manager of the
“Quips and Cranks” this year. Deck is sec-
ond ranking captain of the local R. O. T.
Battalion, and was recently extended a bid
to the Scabbard and Blade, and he is also a
member of Omicron Delta Kappa.
, The student form of government has
proved successful since its inauguration at
Davidson College several years ago. Each
new class learns to respect the rules and
regulations set down in the constitution of
the student body and there are few violations
which the court rules as unworthy of a true
Davidson man,

The membership of the Court of Control
now is as follows: L. L. Deck, Judge; L.
B. Huie, M. FE. Miller, F. C. Kugler, Senior

. members; C. C. Murchison, R. L. Lincoln,

Junior members; R.. McRae, P. R. Maudlen,
Sophomore members.

the spell of the reader and think himself in
the presence of a British soldier in far)
India or a British tar rounding Cape Horn.”

An edifdrial in the same issue made the! 1c
j and

| following statements :
ae Wachter characterized soldier, |
sailors, St. Peter, and the devil with equal |;

success. Bent the best received of his | ‘Sweetie,” said he, “the next kiss must CHARLOTTE, N. C.

selections was his rendition of Masefield's | be the last.”
Cape Horn Gospel. Even the most expe-| his

| rienced tobacco chewers on the campus, and|
| their name is legion, were forced grudgingly
to admit that as the old British tar, the
Proiessor could not be beat. Professor |
Wachter’s interpretation made Kipling’s |
poem seem one hundred per cent more real- |
istic, and to add to Kipling’s power is
genius indeed.”

An added reason why every one should
lavail himself of this opportunity to hear |
| Prot. Wachter give the Kipling program is |
that it is the only Kipling recital that he|
| will give here this year and perhaps it will,
| be the last opportunity the students will have
| to hear him in an evening platform readings.

Cc, year: Captain Bill Cox, Manager Joe Frier- |

Since the announcement that Prof. Wachter |

| was to give the Kipling recital he has been

besieged by insistent requests not to omit |
“Tomlinson” nor “Gunga Din” and by all |
means to repeat Masefield’s “Cape Horn}

| Gospel.” « He had planned to give the “Ex-
|plorer” which is one of Kipling’s unques-

tioned masterpieces and several other num-
| bers not included in last year's program,

|

“but art is long and time is fleeting” and}

Prof. Wachter intends to limit the entire

“ program to an hour and a half,

However, whether the numbers are new |
or old Prof. Wachter will be greeted on!
Tuesday evening by an audience eager to|
listen and ready to applaud. And unless all |
higns fail, it will be an audience which

|
|
|

| will overflow Shearer Hall, and late comers |
| will be greeted by the ushers with the |

| statement “standing room only.”

“The worst thing about living a double |

| life,” says Roland Parker, “is that a fel- |
}.ow seldom gets through twice as soon.” |
