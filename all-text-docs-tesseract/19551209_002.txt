Power and Resolution

We enjoy the fruits of power: we live
in a mould of vaster power. The Creator
has revealed to man many wonderous yet
awesome secrets. The A-bomb, uninhibited
jets, unlimited machines . . . instruments
of peace and war .. . signify an age of
power. This has produced a corresponding
age of benefits, leisure time, comfort, and
convenience. But with this power and its
benefits must come the responsibility of
control. For a future that shows few posi-
tive limits to the forces of power, control
becomes increasingly vital, and lack of it,
fatal. Power is both potentially good and
potentially evil, positive or destructive.

One of the more noted elements of
our power age is the common car. Adver-
tisers flauntingly display its dynamic
power: highways test its endurance: and
traffic tolis record its tragic results.

Look at the figures. Last year, there
were 10.000,000 traffic accidents in the
United States. They killed 36,000 people

.. one every 15 minutes; injured 1 1-4
million others .. . one every 25 seconds;
and cost an estimated 4.4 billion dollars
in medical bills, property loss and other
expense, including loss in earnings.

Of the 36.000 Americans killed in
traffic accidents, 7,800 were of college
age. It is at this age that physical reaction,
mental processes, and ability in the use
of a car should be at a peak.

Why then should this relatively peace-
ful machine become more destructive to
our civilization and individual security
than the dreaded implements of war?
What is the cause of these accidents?

It is not the road, the car, law enforce-
ment, mentally ill, or physically disabled.
It is the driver. Super roads are being
built and improved daily: fallacies of
operation are becoming negative through
planning and maintenance: and driving
requirements are being strengthened and
enforced. Responsibility rests with the in-
dividual.

As columnist Sydney J. Harris has
written recently, our shocking auto acci-
dent rate is “not mental, physical, or
mechanical. Auto accidents are an emo-
tional problem.” They are a result of in-
dividual action and reveal all too fatally
a lack of responsibility with power.

One can offer a hundred suggestions
on how to drive, pitch out dozens of safety
slogans, and string radar lines over the
U. S.—but—they are useless without in-
dividual attention, responsibility, and .con-
trol. The correct approach and right
amount of desire will produce control that
can offer pleasure with safety, conven-
ience with security.

The aspirations of modern college
drivers: the’ crazy scratch-off, dynamic
drags, and perilous passer: coupled with
the tremendous hurry of modern society
produce catastrophic tragedies on the
street corners of human life. One is the
drive for prestige and “power” person-
ality; the other a drive to get somewhere
on time. Both end in twisted steel and
broken bodies. How do you value the hu-
man life?

Man is blessed with great power, won-
derous convenience, and enjoyment in
the modern automobile. Like all other
aspects and elements of power today, it
has its price. That price is individual re-
sponsibility and control. It applies equally
to the A-bomb and to modern society; but
in practical reality the actualities of
atomic warfare are pushed to obscurity
by the staggering totals of everyday auto
accidents. ;

When you travel this Christmas time,
consider carefully the power in your
hands, and accept the responsibility to-
ward yourself and others that it demands.
Conditions for driving will be dangerous
and more cars will be in the running.
Recognize these conditions and observe
the rules that knowledge and judgment
require.

Power can be positive. Accidents must
be prevented.

Out of the Ivory
Chambers

The definition of the Administration
on requirements to remain at Davidson
are based on consideration of the stu-
dents as well as academic interests. Some
individuals inevitably drag through their
first semesters when lack of interest and
ability indicate that they will not grad-
uate at least within the normal span of
years. If allowed to continue they place
a strain on their fraternal organization,
financial resources, and their own time
and attitude. The administrative ruling
eases that situation.

An investigation was made into the
records and figures of last year. It was
found that only two or three freshmen
would have been dropped and a cor-
responding number of upperclassmen if
these rulings had been in effect then.

These requirements are relatively re-
garded as experimental as was the present
cut system when inaugurated. They are
not stringent but quite liberal; and they
should become a positive step in proper
academic and counseling directions.

Out of the swamps of Georgia politics
and the almighty sickle vote came the
odor of inane and harmful action. Cutting
his way through delicate sod of under-
standing, intelligence, and reason a pun-
gent politician plowed up the ground for
pre-spring riots, rabble-rousers, and rump
assemblies. This revelation of social,
moral, and political ineptitude furnished
an amusing yet pathetic tidbit among the
tragedies of the news columns.

What happened in the long run was
understood from the beginning and should
have occurred without a second consider-
ation. Where does a sovereign state un-
cover such downright upstanding lead-
ers? The strain is running low—perhaps
it will run out.

“Glory, glory to old Georgia .. .”

Out of the recent opinion poll on the
Court of Control came some choice items.
First a few words for the English depart-

ment. ‘‘Naturidly.” “abolishion.” “‘bassed.”
“rebelous’ — are a few samples of some

new words found on upperclass polls in
the comment. boxes.

To this writer the most pertinent and
practical comment was in essence this.
There are two basic needs for the Court.
One arises out of the seeming chasm be-
tween freshmen and upperclassmen; the
other is found in a’ freshmen’'s acclimation
to college life. While serving as an instru-
ment of counseling and corrective fore-
sight, the Court can strive to meet these
needs.

Other comments ranged from the sub-
lime to the ridiculous. “Freshmen are
people, too.” “Entire idea is more imma-
ture than the freshmen.” “More of this
is needed.” “Who cares if the freshmen
are immature or not. They might as well
be—it’s their last chance.” “Jt is not in
keeping with Democracy.” “Justice makes
others more just.”

Opposing Opinions on Court Wrangle Presented

Three Traits
Are Essential

The real issue involved in the
question of the Court of Control is
whether or not we, as a ‘student
body, want to exert any influence
on an incoming student's person-
ality. In taking a stand for the
Court of Control or its counterpart,
we must believe that there are cer-
tain traits of a personality which
every Davidson student should pos-
sess; that an organized group em-
ploying coercive methods is the
best means of instilling these
traits; and realize that the suc-

cess of such a program will result
in a somewhat homogeneous com-
munity.

There are three traits; respect-
tuiness, humility, end loyalty which
have been dominant and merit at-
tention es being thought a part of
the “Davidson Gentlemen.”

Respecttuiness

One idea in the Freshman Regu-
lations is that the trait of respect-
fulness is most important. An at-
tempt is made to project this trait
by requiring respect for those who
have come before and respect for,
and knowledge of, the student

part of the “Davidson Gentleman,”
we should give our wholehearted
support to # means which would
best accomplish their end.

If we, as a student body, con-
sider that an organized group em-
ploying coercive methods is the
best means of instilling these
traits. we should insist, upon the
existence of such an organization
and require it to maintain an ef-
fective program.

If we, as a student body, are in

accord with the preceding state-
ments and favor a somewhat homo-
geneous community. We must
exert our every effort and influence
in support of the Court of Control
or a modification of the Court as
it now exists.

Maturity Should
Replace Court

That the Court of Control has
failed this year is a fact generally
accepted. Those who criticize the
members of the present court so as
to impute full responsibility for the
Court's failure upon them fail to
see the central issues involved. This
year’s Court has done all that could
be expected with the support it re-
ceived,

The main point is not, however,
whether measures can be taken to
insure the effective functioning of
the Court; the question is this: Is
the Court, even when it functions
effectively by its own standards, e
necessary or justifiable institution
on the Davidson campus? There is
reason to believe it is not.

Traditional Basis

It is ironic that those who criti-
eize many Davidson traditions fall
so easily in the line of defense of
the Court of Control on the basis
of tradition. Tradition is completely
unimportant, regardless of its age,
unless it exhibits significance for
the present situation and promises
to continue being significant.

The best argument for justifica-
tion of the Court is that it proposes
to aid freshmen in adjusting to the
college environment. The Court,
however, does not fulfill this pur-
pose. Indeed it may fail completely,
and instances may be cited to prove
that it has failed. In the case of the
shy, insecure individual, the Court

manages successfully to increase
his feelings of*insecurity, since it
is not action but fear of action that
usually causes such harm as __ iy
done.

In the case of the cocky fresh.
man a Court meeting often pro-
vides a situation in which vigorous
approval of his attitude is manifest.

The best function of the Court
is that in some cases it replaces
irrational hazing by a milder form
of the same, but hazing and other
methods of “corrective discipline”
can be replaced by constructive
methods.

Mature Adjustment

There is no single purpose or
function of the Court of Control
that is not more effectively and
more naturally taken care of by a
healthy college situation that puts
its collective sanction upon those
aspects of individual personality
that show promise of developing
along lines of maturity, and that
refuses approval of those attitudes
which fail to indicate 2s trend
toward mature adjustment. The ap- .
proval or disapproval of the Court
of Control neither encourages pres-
ent attitudes nor provides reason.
eble motivation for adopting other
attitudes.

To take the best possible ad-
vantage of the present situation
and to indicate the maturity we of-
ten profess but seldom demon-
strate, the student body must un- ,
equivocably decide to abolish an
outdated, useless system for im-
posing the will of the many upon
the few. It must recognize each
student's right, regardless of scho-
lastic class, to exercise his individ-
ual powers in a mature college so-
ciety that affords them scope and
which provides a reasonable stand-
ard for the judgment of progress
along lines of worth.

Teacher Shortage Faces Nation

By TOM WARLICK

The recent White Huuse confer-
ence on education as well as sev-
eral reports and studies which have
been made public have focused
much attention on the serious prob-
lems which face the United States
in the field of education.

These are brought about in part.
by the tremendous increase in pu-
pil enrollment which has taken
place since World War II and will
continue in the future. During this
period elementary school enroll.
ment has increased over 50 percent
and is expected to increase to an
all time high of 33,750,000 in 1960.
By 1969 secondary school enroll-
ment will haye increased over 70
percent above last years figure to
an astounding 12,361,000.

The college outlook, our most in-
timate concern at present, is like-
wise discouraging. It is evident that
college enroltment will have
doubled from the present figure of
2,500,000 by some time between the
years 1966 and 1971. One recent
projection places the figure at 7-
231,000 by 1973.

The staggering increases in en-
rolimeut will be accompanied by
many evils such as increased taxa-
tion and overcrowded classrooms.
The far more serious problem, how-
ever, is in securing the additional
teachers which will be needed if
an increased teacher load or part
time schooling, which will result in
less time spent per pupil, are to be
avoided. Last September the
schools were short 140,000 quall-
fied teachers.

Of equal importance, then, with
every other problem is that of se-
curing adequate teachers in the fu-
ture. The situation is desperate.
More than half of the college grad-
uates of the next ten years will
have to enter teaching if the na-
tion's schools are to be adequate-
ly staffed during that period. At
present only one-fifth of college
graduates become teachers.

At the college level the replace.
ment rate is lower than at the
elementary or secondary levels,
but the need for expansion is
greater. For every ten faculty mem-
bers now on the job between six-
teen and twenty-five new ones will
have to be found between now and
1970. This means that colleges and
universities wil! have to add more
professors in the next fifteen years
than they have in all previous his-
tory.

Although shortages of teachers
in all levels of education result
largely from rising enrollment, low
salaries, and high teacher load, in
the field of higher education the
teacher shortage reflects several
other factors. Among these are the
competition of government, bus!l-
ness, and the other professions. The
report concludes that after 1900,

when the student rolls rise, “pres-
ent recruitment difficulties are
likely to seem trivial.”

The only real solution would ap-
pear to be to increase faculty sal-
aries to such a level as to be more
attractive than those offered by
government and industry.

The need is for teachers. The
need is for men of the caliber of
Davidson students to become col-
lege professors. If salary raises are

not forthcoming the only reward
will have to be a job well done or
a feeling of contributing something
worthwhile to society. However, in
many cases the prospect of higher
salaries, and better teaching condi-

tions seems to be quite real. Cer-
tainly no more propitious time has
offered itself of late for the én-
trance of an aspiring and qualified
student into teaching.

Squeeze of Red Imperialism

BY PHIL KUKURA

Few people other than geogra-
phers know much more about the
country called Afghanistan than
that it is located off the beaten
track somewhere jin central Asia.
Yet for the last one hundred years
this nation has served as an in-
valuable blockade restraining Rus-
sia in her push toward the vast
subcontinent of India and the In-
dian Ocean. After a calm period of
over half a century while Russia
has been more concerned about
her internal affairs than expan-
sion, this area is once again feel-
ing the pressure of Russian im-
perialism. The United States, in
line with its containment policy,
is faced with the problem of check-
ing this Soviet advance through
Afghanistan into Pakistan and In-
dia.

Afghanistan is 2 landlocked
country, bounded by Russie on the
north, Iran on the west, and Pekis-

tan on the south and east. In its

central position in Asie it has
straddled what were for many
years the main trade and migration
routes of the world. Alexander the
Great spent several years there on
his campaign of conquest, using it
es @ base of operations against tn-
die, and from there Genghis Khan’s
hordes swept westward toward
Burope. The overland spice trade
routes between Europe end the
Orient passed through Afghanis-
sten and the femous Khyber Pass.

A Buffer Stete

After the voyages of Vasco da
Gama and the establishment of an
all-water route to the East, traffic
through Afghanistan fell off sharp-
ly and stopped almost dead in the
middle of the nineteenth century
when Russia’s southward expan-
sion through central Asia was met
by Britain’s strength flowing out
of India. Britain wanted Afghanis-
tan for a buffer state to protect
her interests in India from Russia,
arid after a series of wars, effec-
tively checked Russian expansion
toward the south on the Oxus River,

Afghanistan’s northern boundary.
These positions on the Oxus,
Britain at the Khyber Pass on the
east, and Afghanistan pacifically
wedged between the two giants
seemed permanent.

This situation was maintained
throughout the nineteenth and into
the twentieth century while Russia
was concerned with her internal af-
fairs and consolidation following
the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917
and while Britain remained in her
position of strength in India. Fol-
lowing World War i! Russia was

ready to resume her territorial ex-

pansion, and Britain's influence
was removed when her rule of
india terminated in 1947. The re-
sultant vacuum of the British with-
drawal from this area was not filled
at once by the Russians because
of their preoccupation with affairs
in eastern Europe and the Chinese
Civil War...

Until last spring Russia made no
attempt to aid Afghanistan in its
development, but since then has
flooded the country with offers and
agreements for technical aid. She
has been working feverishly to
make Afghanistan’s simple econo-
my dependent on her, by absorbing
all her marketable products.

Further Conflict

The problem of limiting Russian
expansion in this field has become
considerably more complex in the
last few months. With Soviet
backing the Afghanistan gov-
ernment has demanded from Pak-
istan the area known as Pakh-
toonistan, populated by Pakhtoon
tribes now in revolt against Pakis-
tan, who are blood relatives of the
Afghan monarchy. This Pakhtoon
territory amounts to about one half
the area of Pakistan, and she re-
fuses to surrender control over it.
Both Afghani and Pakistani are
ready to fight for their claim to .
this area, but Afghanistan can at-
tempt armed action against Pakis-
tan only with the aid of Soviet arm-
aments.
