DRESS UP FOR SENIOR WEEK.

It is only about ten more days until
Senior week. That, above all times of
the year, is when we wish to’be dressed
with distinction, for distinction in dress
lis the best means of expressing one’s
individual personality. Distinction has
always been the keynote of fashion. So-
|ciety is continually. searching for it.
| There are three features that make
|complete distinction in dress: a suit that
perfectly fits your type of figure; has
superior wearing quality that holds its
fit and style through months of wear;
has easy flexibility. These three fea-
tures you get in every Hart-Schaffer-
Marx suit. If you buy one of these you
will have a suit that after months of
wear you can truthfully say “It is as
good as it was when I bought it.”

Ed. Mellon carries a complete line of
Hart-Schaffer-Marx clothes. You can
find any style, any pattern, any size
there. Ed. Mellon’s caters to those men
who appreciate true quality, and who
have the perception of an artist which
must be the foundation of all becoming-
ness in dress. Nothing is left to chance.
They have suits in stock, at all times,
for every type of figure, yours is among
them, whether you are fat or slim, long
or short, in proportion or out of pro-
portion, they can fit you perfectly. They
have special models created especially
for college men that will reflect your
individual personality.

A Hart-Schaffer-Marx suit, a pair of
brogue shoes and a Knox hat would add
greatly to your distinction Senior week.
Dressed in these you will be envied by
your buddies and admired by all the
“fire.” And if you desire more complete
perfection in dress, add to the aboye a

3ates street or Manhattan shirt, stiff
collar attached, and a‘knit tie.

To repeat again what we have said in
these columns before, “Just because you
try on a suit or hat, or pair of shoes
at Mellons is no reason for your buying
it.” They want you to be perfectly
pleased with your purchases.

FOR ALL COLD TROUBLES

BLANKETS TO BE |
PROVIDED FOR TEAMS,

A much felt need is soon to be rem-
edied in the gift by the student body to
the Athletic Association of blankets for
our athletic teams. The student body
voted to tax each man 50 cents, which
will be enough to obtain 19 large size
blankets. Dt. J. M. McConnell has do-
nated one personally, making 20 in all.
These blankets, to be black with a red
12-inch D, are extra heavy and will last
for years. It is obvious that they can
be put to real service by the Wildcats,
and will improve the looks of the team
on the field 100 per cent,

' The student body is always behind the
Wildcats, and this is one more tribute |
to those who fight our battles. |
