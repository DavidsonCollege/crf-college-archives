Reston Urges Two Standards
For Impeachment Articles

By ANDY LAMAS
Senior News Editor

‘The second standard‘of im-
peachment can be defined as a
serious dereliction from
public duty."’ stated James
Reston Jr.. political novelist.

Reston spoke about the
prospects for impeaching
President Nixon in a speech to
an overcrowded Phi Hall on
April 15

“Everyone knows about the
first Standard _ of im-
peachment. A high govern-
ment official can be removed
from office on impeachment
for, and conviction of. treason.

and misdemeanors.” claimed
Reston.

Reston is the only man in the
nation, as far as he knows.
who is calling for an omnibus
article -- like his second stan-

dard - to be included on the
impeachment articles.

Reston remarked that the
only way we can deal with the
men involved on Watergate is
to apply the second standard
of impeachment.

‘How else can we deal with
a pattern of corruption and
political crime such as this?”
asks Reston.

Since the Watergate affair
was exposed. Reston has war-
ned the American public to
keep in mind all of the im-
portant information which has
surfaced as a result of the
Various investigations

“We all tend to kick out of
our intellectual circuits a lot of
information that we should
continue to consider.

‘This has happened because
our circuits have been over-
crowded with information by
the press,” explained Reston.

Reston spoke briefly about
impoundment of funds and
Cambodia bombing, but most
of his attack centered around
the Watergate affair.

“From the June 20th tape,
there is no doubt that the
cover-up was in motion im-
mediately after the break-in
occurred.” claimed Reston.

“What Nixon puts into

Reston raised objections to
Nixon's insinuations on March
21 about the legality of raising
hush money

“Just think of all the tapes
that the President has failed to

about that March 21 tape with
its 18!= minute gap. This is ou:

Buckley Chides Nixon, China’s Tactics

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Managing Editor

William F. Buckley Jr. ar-
ticulated the ideal of freedom
and the necessity of its preser-
vation. following a_ raving
round of applause by a near-
capacity crowd in Love
Auditorium Wednesday night.

Using his eloquent style and
snide comments to the fullest
extent, Buckley explained his
concern for the growing ten-
dency in America to retreat
from the moral opposition that
it should have toward the for-
ces that threaten the safety of
this country, i.e. communism.

Making no effort to lecture
on the domestic issues con-
cerning the federal govern-
ment, in Washington, Buckley
may have disappointed many
observers who came to hear
one of the leading con-
servative’s views regarding
the crises which this country
faces

But the thrust of Buckley's
talk was as American as apple
pie and baseball. He spoke as
a conservative and came

across very well, in that
respect.
Many people were not

overly enthused with the
words which they heard Wed-
nesday night. But then, this is
not a completely conservative
campus.

To some people. Buckley
sounded like a war hawk.
ready to leap the charge into
the battle against the com-
munists. He _ criticized
President Richard Nixon for
his attitude toward many of
his undertakings while in of-
fice. Basically he inferred that
Nixon infuses overtones of
moral righteousness in his ef-
forts, including the  in-
creasingly friendly relations
with the People’s Republic of
China (PRC).

He then made reference to
Nixon’s comparison of the
American and Communist
Revolutions. Buckley ex-
pressed the opinion that the
former was fought to permit
freedom and the latter, while
possibly being fought for this
purpose, ended with the ex-
tinguishing of freedom.

A question which followed
during a brief discussion
period linked the un-
derpriviledged. status ‘of the

masses in the PRC to the
plight of the poor and minority
people in America, asking for
Buckley's opinion on the idea.

He replied to the effect that,
if you mean the rich are freer
than the poor, I don't deny
that. But the poor in the
United States are much better
off than the Chinese masses.

He then continued by citing
many figures which evidenced
a decline in the number of
poor people of America.
Saying that only seven percent
of Americans are now poor.

Freedom was the prevailing
theme of his talk, though. He
waved the flag well and
provided listeners with many
interesting quotations as he
meticulously moved through a
well-prepared speech.

Buckly’s speech could be
taken as a lash at the anti-war
movements on college cam-
puses in the mid to late sixties.
He warned that, in dealing
with the Communists, it is
imperative that we do not
forget the moral distinctions
between the two systems. He
made it clear that we could
deal with them without
praising them and condoning
their form of government.

This implies a position
which would oppose the con-
cern of students in the sixties
over the war in Southeast
Asia, which many felt was un-

‘warranted. Buckley continu-:: .

ally emphasized the moral
obligation of Americans to
keep the Communists in
check.

Buckley hovered over the
audience with his broad
knowledge of politics and
literature. His speech and

discussion afterwards were

highlighted by his ability to

lead himself to a point which
would find a favorable position
with most of the audience.
This allowed him to move on
without fully dealing with the
questions presented.

Buckley also entertained the
audience with many
humorous’ remarks. _in-
termingled with his quotations
from various persons.

“All of the ‘Is he a crook?
questions apply to the first
standard of impeachment.”
remarked Reston.

Reston favors inclusion of
the second standard because
he is concerned about the
“manipulative effects of the
law ** He does not want the
President's guilt or innocence
to be determined on small
technical points of law.

“The first standard must
continue to be the main focus
I think it will be sufficient to
impeach Richard Nixon.
however. we should still con-
sider the second standard.

‘We must not let the im-
peachment charges be boiled
down to a few technical
crimes. That's why a general
statement. like the second
standard, must be attached to
the impeachment articles.
also.’ he stated.

Reston also addressed him-
self to the President's respon-
sibility to the actions of his
subordinates.

“Even Nixon said on April
30, that ‘the men at the top
must fear the responsibility: ’
that's sufficient for me.”

Reston believes that the
Watergate affair was the final
outcome of the July 1970
Houston Plan. This was a plan
submitted to Nixon by his aide

Charles Houston. It called tor
unlimited powers for in-
telligence gathering in the

US

“It was a set of principles
which would constitute. quite
frankly. a violation of the first
amendment.”
