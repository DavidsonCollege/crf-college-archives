The English think all Americans are rich, and other
JYA stories from England, Australia and India

By PHILLIP PRESCOTT

Larry Dagenhart in England

I went to Britain knowing what I
would be doing but not knowing what
to expect. Since I went with the Univer-
sity of Maryland program, I figured
they had probably screened my house
mother and taken care of other worries.
As I later found out, she had been
boarding students for ten years.

Thad been abroad before in 1986. I had
spent five weeks in France and Ger-
many, staying in Germany with a Ger-
man family that were friends of my
family. I was hoping to make some Brit-
ish friends, but it didn’t really happen.
The British people are hard to get to
know; you had to know a person for a
long time before you became good
friends. However, I did learn more
about British culture, and I developed
friendships with the Maryland stu-
dents.

Any aspiring tourist has to realize

stands in front of the Bridge of Sighs.

Larry Dagenhart, who went to England through the University of Maryland program,

that Europe is very expensive and
people there are often not used to the
services we expect in the States. Often,
you don’t save money by purchasing
things in quantity.

Traveling is great for a student with
an International ID, which gives dis-
counts on the railways, museums and
other tourist attractions. In London,
candy is very inexpensive if you wanta
bargain present to bring back home.

All our traveling was done on our
own; that was one of the great things
about the Maryland program. The
youth hostels and bed and breakfasts
were the best places to stay. Actually, I
took a plane to Paris. You can get some
really good deals through a student
tourist office.

Many stereotypes concerning Ameri-
cans exist among English people. They
think that we are all rich. Some English
people wish they could live in America
with all its amenities. They like Ameri-
can television, films and cheaper food.

Funny as it seems, most British can
easily spot an American, and you can
become somewhat self-conscious.

One of my favorite things in London
was the Cabinet War Rooms where
Winston Churchill and his staff
planned war strategy during World
War II. The Tower of London was also
among my favorite sights. Scotland and
Ireland possess incredible scenic
beauty. The Eiffel Tower beckons to all
who visit Paris!

I thought there would be kangaroos
in the parks like squirrels, but it’s not
like that. You have to goout of your way
to find them. It’s like America wasa 100
years ago. Capitalism hasn’t sunk in
there like it has in America.

I was in Melbourne. | thought it
would be much warmer than it actually
was, but it rained a lot. I went with
Marymount University, of New York,
but nobody in our group was from
Marymount. ] was the only person from
the South. The others were from Cali-
fornia, New York and elsewhere.

In Australia there is a big difference
between the city and the country. A city
person is just like here, but in the coun-
try there are cowboys like “Crocodile
Dundee.”

Australians love Americans. They are
really excited that others want to see
their country and find out what it’s all
about. Classes were not required and
there were no exams, but we did have
papers.

When I wasn’t traveling, I usually
went to the pubs and nightclubs in the

_ city. One thing about Australia is

people are always on strike. The buses
and trains were almost always on strike
at least one day a week. The trains are
definitely the way to travel. I traveled
5000 miles for $200 on a ticket with
unlimited stops. Australia is so spread
out that you really need 24 hours to
reach the next big city.

The most impressive thing I saw was
the Great Barrier Reef. It’s amazing:
2,500 miles of many colors with sharks
and turtles swimming in it. :

One place to stay, especially if you’re
budget-minded, is a backpacker’s
place. For about $6a night, you geta bed
inacommunal room. However, you get
no privacy.

It worked out well that my host
mother was a biology teacher at the
University of Melbourne. I told her I
was wondering if there was an island to
scuba dive off of fora week. She knew of
Harrin Island off the barrier reef where
many biology students do research. I
went to the island and brought two
friends with me. They didn’t have any
research, so we worked only nine hours
over six days.

I also visited Airs Rock, which the
aborigines used to think was the center
of the universe before the white man
came. It’s the biggest rock in the world,
as big asa mountain, and you canclimb
it.

I also went to China for 8 days and 7
nights. It was a $750 student travel deal
which included round-trip air fare from
Australia and a four-star hotel, as well
assome of the best restaurantsand most
of the tourist attractions.

When I went to China, it was the 100th
day anniversary of the student mas-
sacre. The country was under martial
law, but it wasn’t how we would envi-
sion it. No curfew was enforced. Only
the army and tourists were allowed in
Tiananmen Square. When we went to
the square, we were made to signa con-
sent form that we wouldn't tell anyone
about what we saw. However, our tour
guide was at the massacre and asked
what we thought about the incident.

The Chinese generally like Ameri-
cans, especially those that are tall. The
person I traveled with was tall and
weighed 250 pounds. They got a big —

Davidson starts its own version of “networking”

By GIRISH GVALANI

Those of us who were
around last year probably re-
member some workmen dig-
ging over a period of a few au-
tumn afternoons in front of
Chambers.

That was the innocuous start
of an operation that culmi-
nated quietly this winter just
before we all returned: the in-
stallation and debugging of
Decnet, the Davidson Com-
puter Network. The latest
achievement of the Computer
Servicesin this regard hasbeen
to successfully put into opera-
tion a classroom in Chambers

specifically designed for those

classes which stress (no pun
intended) the application of
computers in their curriculum.

Four-letter words are bad
‘enough; eight-letter words like
computer are worse still. But
strangely enough the NCRasit
is called, will not be such an

ogreas we may imagineit tobe,
according to informed sources.
For one thing, itis hooked up to
Decnet.

What’s so special about
Decnet?

For starters, it eliminates the
need to develop ulcers when
your Computer screams “Put
WordPerfect 2 Diskette back in
Drive A,” speeds up your work
hugely, allows you to print in
any one of twonetworked loca-
tions on campus from a single
terminal, or as a matter of fact,
print on any one of seven net-
worked printers across cam-
pus, including two Laser Print-
ers from any one of 40 net-
worked terminals around cam-
pus.

Interested? There’s more. It
allows students access to the
campus electronic mail system
as well as to electronic mail
systems at other colleges via
Bitnet.

A word about Bitnet. It al-
lows you toconnect toovertwo
thousand locations world-
wide, and best of all, at
Davidson it’s free! To those
privileged ( or cursed, which-
ever way we see it ) few who
actually enjoy computing there
issoftware and loads of itavail-
able on the Network, anytime,
anywhere. Word Perfect,
Turbo Pascal, Turbo C, Assem-
bler, Debugger, Norton’s Utili-
ties, MathCad, MPP, Ma-
trixPad, ODE, IAPL and Quat-
tro are just a few to get your
hands on. Those of. us who
know what it is to suffer ago-
nies when our diskette runs out
of room for the file we must
save will surely appreciate the

fact that Decnet makes it pos-

sible for the student to now
store 1.4 Megabytes of Word
Perfect or Quattro files or about
140 six-page papers through
the Network in their VAX ac-

counts. More than enough for
one semester.

All this is available in the
NCR. Best of all it is all in Eng-
lishin Menus, whichask you to
select options before you start
working on your paper.So you
don’t need to be able to read
Sanskrit or know whataSIMM,
DRAM or CHIP is to get the
most out of Decnet.

The NCR has much to offer
for professors as well.

Members of the faculty who
have already started using the
NCR include RichardNeidin-
ger and Bruce Jackson, profes-
sors of mathematics; and
David Martin, professor of
economics. Some who antici-
pate using it later this semester
are Mary Thornberry, profes-
sor of political science; Glenn
C. Lindsey, professor of eco-
nomics; andZoranKuzma-
novich, professor of English.
Each of them has innovative

plans as to how he or she will
use the NCR toenrich the qual-
ity of the course they teach, but
they all agree that exposing the
college student to the applica-
tions and importance of com-
puters in today’s world is their
main objective.

According to Sue Varga-
Ward, the Director of Aca-
demic Computing at the CSC,
another often-overlooked yet
extremely important advan-
tage of the NCR is that it offers
the faculty and the student
body at Davidson an opportu-
nity to enjoy the advantages of
a Mainframe Computer, an
Opportunity : presently
availalbe to very few even in
the U.S.A.
