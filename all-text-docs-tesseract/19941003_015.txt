What is
the NHL
thinking?

By Matt Pitzer

Let’s see what we've got here:
one of the most exciting
postseasons in any sport, leaving
fans itching for more; a great, new
TV contract with Fox network;
popularity for the sport at an all-
time high, giving ita chance to join
the other major sports in this coun-
try.

What a great time for a lock-
out. At least, that’s what the NHL
owners think. Of course, they’re
wrong. Very wrong.

“With baseball done for the
year, hockey could have dominated
the sports world nearly every day
throughout October. Butthat must
have been too good of an opportu-
nity for the game’s leaders, who
"are used to being relegated to the
back of the sports pages and the
last few minutes of SportsCenter.

Nearly all sports fans were
looking forward to the season. Dur-
ing last spring’s Stanley Cup,
hockey was rediscovered by
Americans, when the New York
Rangers won for the first time in
50-odd years. The Cup got very
high ratings on ESPN, even though
NYC was watching on a different
channel and Vancouver is in
Canada. Fox decided this was a

great time to jump on board and.

give the NHL a boost with a nice,
fat TV deal.

But, .as commissioner Gary
Bettman announced Friday, the
league is on the brink of financial
disaster, with nearly all the teams
losing money and needing salary
caps and revenue-sharing to even
hope to stay afloat.

Well, folks, you really haven’t
thought things through carefully.
‘With no baseball, what’s a sports
fan to do Monday through Friday?
The arenas probably would have
been packed, the TV ratings prob-
ably would have soared. Appar-
ently, though, the owners believed
that joining their baseball counter-
parts on the sidelines and at the
bottom of sports fans’ hearts was
the best alternative.

Think back to this summer’s
World Cup. Remember how ev-
erybody was talking about using
that opportunity to create a niche
for soccer here in the U.S.? Well,
most soccer efforts have bumbled
about, doing a whole lot of nothing
in the four months since the tour-

nament. Now, soccer is just about |-

back to where it started.

Contrast this with hockey.
People were excited about the up-
coming year, hoping it could even
come close to matching last sea-
son. But the owners, not learning
anything from either baseball or
soccer, put the game on hold for at
least two weeks. This “‘postpone-
ment” is a bad thing. A real bad
thing. Hockey is a great sport, a
fun sport, an exciting sport. Now,
there is no greatness, no fun, no
excitement. It’s hurts to say it, but
it’s true: hockey will get what it
deserves.

‘After a rebuilding season last
year, the Davidson swimming and
diving teams are expecting great
success in the ‘94-’95 season.

Led by Head Coach Rich
DeSelm. and Assistant Coaches
Sam Jalet and Kim McDonald, the
swim team is prepared to take on
their stiff schedule against ACC
and ACC-level schools. The swim
program here is relatively young,
with a majority of underclassmen,
but DeSelm has confidence his
team is ready for a high level of
competition. On the women’s
team, sophomores Susanne Her-
ring and Meri Mucha led the team
last year and will be supported this
year by sophomore newcomer,
Catherine Sweeney and Katie
Palmer will come on strong. One
of the team’s co-captains Katherine
Welling is abroad, but the other,
Wendy Johnson is ready to help
the team through the ‘94 season.
The women’s team set a number of
records last year, but Coach
DeSelm thinks that “the program
is ready to take another step.”

The men’s swimming team
spotlights Corey Bean as their only

leading upperclassman_ because
Churchill Hooff is abroad. Corey
and Churchill are co-captains.
Sophomore Tim Lim is expected
to make a strong comeback after
being injured last season. Among
the freshmen, Matt Buck is. fea-
tured as a high school All-Ameri-
can, both in athletics and academ-
ics. Jonathan Frost, Matt Lake,
David Maddux, Mike Scarbo and
Freddy Schnell round out the strong
freshmen roster. DeSelmhastimed
most of these male swimmer as
faster than school records in at
least one event. “They can’t help
but be better,” says DeSelm, “‘be-
cause the younger swimmers force
the older ones to improve.”

The Davidson diving team,
coached by Marcia Waymouth,
boasts the second place diver in the
Souther Conference, junior Meg
Bentley. Waymouth expects
Bentley to continue her success
this season on both the one and
three meter boards,

The team of four male diver is
led by the continuously successful
senior and captain Thad Reece.
Reece, along with his fellow divers,
is anxiously awaiting the first meet.

“We know what’s coming and
know how we match up against the
competition. We also know from
experience what dives work against
certain teams,” Reece says. Reece
also believes the number of home

meets they have and the confer-

ence championships being here will
be an extra advantage this season.

Two sophomores contributed
a great deal to the team last year
with high conference rankings.
Michael Hart will be a top con-
tender this year after finishing last
season second on the three meter
and third on the one meter. Andy
Borleski ended last year sixth place
on the one meter and seventh on
the three meter.

Freshman Jonathan Frost,

Waymouth says, “is extremely tal-
ented and strong, but needs some
practice onthe three meter.” Reece
thinks all freshmen have to go
through the process of “getting used
to the college atmosphere in div-
ing because you’re not diving for
yourself; you’ re diving fora team.”

The diving team’s first meet is
away at Virginia Tech on October
22, and their first home meet is
Parent’s Weekend. Coach _
Waymouth believes that “heavy
competition from last year is gone,
but you never know about the new
freshmen.” Reece feels areal sense
of team- identity, especially with
the polished dives of Michael Hart
and the gymnastic ability of new-
comer Jonathan Frost.
