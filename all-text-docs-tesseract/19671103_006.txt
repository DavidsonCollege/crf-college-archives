New Equipment Improves
College Laundry Service

By RICHARD COWART
Staff Writer

The improved service in the College Laundry this

year is due to a unique system of operation, utilizing

newly installed, modern equipment.

C. W. Stacks, manager of the laundry, said, “This
is the only operation of its kind.”

Stacks also pointed out that laundry here gives

much better service than laundries at most other col-

leges.
“We're the only school that

I've heard of without any
restrictions on the students’
use of the laundry.’ he said.
The new equipment in the
laundry was installed during
a two-week period last sum-
mer. The most important ad-
ditions to the laundry are
two shirt pressers which are
more efficient. Shirts this
year are returned to the
student on hangers instead of
being folded. as in previous
years.

- Notice Drawn

By Peace Vigils

A group of Davidson students observed a

nesday. They gathered in front of the college *

peace vigil to protest the war in Vietnam Wed- i
¥

during chapel period.

This was the second vigil, and there are plans
‘to have one every Wednesday during chapel

i

period. Their purpose is to give an opportunity
for concerned individuals to express their dis-
approval of the government’s present Vietriam

policy.

The following students were asked “Do you
think the peace vigils will accomplish anything?”
Naim Ahmed, Richardson Scholar: ‘The ulti-
mate decisions about the war are made in the
White House, not the Davidson College playing
fields. Therefore the peace vigils here are a mere

exercise in futility.”

Robin Gottfried, sophomore: “I don’t think
it is going to accomplish that much for the simple
reason that most of the students won't really pay
attention to what is going on.”

Bill Schmickle, senior: “Campuses all over
the nation are alive with issues: Davidson isn’t. If
students and faculty are both challenged to par-
ticipate in this form of discussion it may, hope-
fully, lead to further beneficent polemics.’”

their church history he term.
ed ‘“‘encrusted in creeds .. .
and taken very literally.”

The chapel program drew
caustic words from the criti-
cal professor. ‘‘Although I do
not agree with the. whistling
and newspaper. reading and
sleeping. in chapel,’: he said,
“I was sorely tempted to do
so myself.”

In his. talk, Cully portrayed
the Sunday School as irrel
evant. Sunday Schoo! art he
criticized as ‘“‘the gentle
Jesus kind of picture which
does not speak’ to the present
age.”

In moral areas, the church
was criticized as being over-
ly successful in teaching per-
sonal piety and unable to
deal with a changing culture
because of the irrelevance of
personal piety.

Mrs. Cully continued the
criticism by saying the Bible

is still a closed book, a sit-. '

uation which is seen in the
constantly changing fads that
emphasize first one aspect of
the Bible and then another.
The themes of the fads
change. and never reflect.
more than a partial under-
standing.

Mrs. Cully also criticized
Sunday Schools for ‘giving
answers to unasked ques-
tions.”

“Sunday School never
learned how to deal with
doubt and scepticism,” she
said. “The time must come
when one appropriates the
faith for himself."

. She called for a ciurch
drama without an_ outright
evangelical motivation, but
one that speaks to man’s con-
dition if his life now.: ‘

In the last two minutes, the
floor was opened for questigns
from students, but there were
none.

Stacks said.

Other new equipment in-
cludes a monorail system
which carries laundry from
the sorters to the washers.
and from the washers to the
dryers. In addition, the dry.
ers themselves are new, as
are the automatically rotat-

ing shirt racks for hanging

finished shirts until they are
claimed by the student.

According to Stacks, the
new equipment has produced
“very little change’’ in the
cost of operating the laundry.
The machinery has, however.
offset higher labor costs by
eliminating six previously
necessary jobs.

Stacks said he plans to
continue adding new equip-
ment until he establishes a
fully automated operation.

The next proposed addition

to the laundry will be a con-.

veyor belt which will carry
the students’ bundles to the
sorters before washing. Pres-
ently, the bundles are placed
in large carts which are
wheeled across the floor to

Stacks was asked about the
type of complaints that he
has received from students
this year. “Complaints?” he
responded. ‘‘There have been
very few.”

He explained that some stu-
dents have complained about
the wrinkled clothes,  es-
pecially pants. which are re-
turned wrapped in the stu-
dent's bundles.

He added that the student
body seems to be unaware
that these articles will be
pressed free of charge upon
request when a student picks
up his laundry.

“All a student has to do is
remove from his bundle any
pants he wants pressed.”
Stacks said, ‘‘and we wil
press them for him and put
them on a hanger with his
shirts.”
