THE DAVIDSONIAN

@ Marcus Williams shows off his vertical leap during
a recent football practice. The Wildcats, who return 15
starters and 50 lettermen, have a shot at back-to-back
winning seasons — something that hasn’t been done
at Davidson in 38 years.

Football squad looks to post back-to-back winning seasons.

Win standard of seven not out of reach

By MIcHAEL J. Kruse
Editor in Chief

_In this, the 100th year of the
program, the football team might
actually have something to celebrate
other than longevity.

With 50

cats’ deepest position.

Fullback Eric Ferguson, who
set Davidson rookie records last
year with 595 yards rushing and a
team-leading.10 touchdowns, high-
lights a versatile ground attack.

“Eric brings a whole new di-
mension,”

lettermen and 15
starters returning

Landis ex-
plained. “They

— including ev- ;
ery player who threw or ran the
football in 1996 — the Wildcats
have a chance to post back-to-back
winning seasons for the first time in
38 years, and have a realistic shot at
breaking the school’s win record of
seven.

(opponent de-
fenses) are going to have to pay an
awful lot of attention to him at full-
back.”

Which will, in turn, open more
and wider holes for Lorenzo Moll,
Nate Hagerman, and Bryan Kern,

Ben Spivey, who paced last
year’s squad with four, sacks, an-
Ysa the defensive front, and Clif

enry, Chad Wright, and Donnie
Johnson make up three-fourths of a
formidable secondary.

“As a whole team, this is the
tightest, most close-knit group of
guys we’ ve had,” defensive coordi-
nator Tripp Merritt said. “That’s
what excites me.”

All of which has Wildcat grid-
iron fans, already giddy because of
this season’s historical significance,
thinking seven, eight, even nine wins
— ridiculous numbers only two
years ago when Davidson struggled

through a mind-

Landis and his
staff also wel-

“The Wildcats will play their 100th year of intercollegiate football
this fall, and all signs point to a season to celebrate. The skill positions

close-but-no-ci-
gar 1-8-1 cam-

comedmorethan are particularly well-fortified, and 15 returning starters fromaé-4club  paign.

30 freshmen to suggest Davidson will have back-to-back winning seasons for the “Be-
summer training first time in 30 years.” —Street and Smith’s fore wecancon-
camp, as the ros- centrate on the
ter ballooned to win record,

84 — the largest number in years.

“Even if it wasn’t the 100th
year of football and we weren't
going to Tampa, we'd still be ex-
cited about this season,” Landis said
last week.

Tommy Dugan, whose strong
play in late October and November
helped Davidson close 1996 with
three straight wins, is poised to start
at quarterback. But Matt Strader
and Shaun Tyrance are pushing for
playing time, creating healthy com-
petition within possibly the Wild-

three tailbacks who are all entirely
capable of contributing large chunks
of yardage.

Nine of the 11 Wildcats who
caught a pass in 1996 also return,
headed by Mike Harrington, whose
21 receptions were second-most on
the squad.

The defense features a first-
‘team line-backing corps of Shreve
Ariail, Wes Thornton, and Chris
Hess — last year’s three leading
tacklers and a group Landis calls
“the best in my time as head coach.”

we've got to have back-to-back
winning seasons,” Landis said.

“That’s our No. | goal. If we
get six wins real quickly, then we
can adjust the bar.”

The players, though, are not
nearly so cautious in their optimism.

“The seniors keep upping the
ante,” Ferguson said. “The other
day, somebody said they wanted to
go 11-0.”

“T think players believe again,”
Merritt said, “people believe again,
and coaches believe again.”

Centennial Season features celebratory Sewanee game and trip to Tampa

By Micuaet J. Kruse
Editor in Chief

A century of anything is a big
deal, and the athletic department
and football program are treating
the Wildcats’ 100th year of inter-
collegiate gridiron competition as
such.

The whole season — thanks to
this year’s Wildcats, a promising
bunch — has ike potential to be
memorable, but the actual so-called
Centennial Celebration will take
place in conjunction with the team’s
Sept. 20 game against Sewanee.

The itinerary includes a lun-
cheon at 11:30, a patade at 12:30, a
buffet dinner at 6:00, evening ac-
tivities at the Union, and receptions
for Davidson football alums from
as far back-as the 1930s.

According to football secretary
Jeanette Scire, the parade — which
will go from Main Street to Con-
cord Road and then into Richardson
Field — will feature various mas-
cots from the area, including the
Panthers’ Sir Purr; dozens of cars
which will carry former Wildcat
captains, most notably those of the
1935 squad; jugglers, horses, and
floats.

Little Miss North Carolina,
Miss Lake Norman, and Santa
Claus, of all people, will also make
appearances. :

Rock Deaton, who has not
missed a Davidson football game in
roughly four decades — a stretch

that amounts to approximately 300 |

consecutive games — will serve as
Grand Marshall.

Crowd estimates from various
sources — some more reliable than
others — have ranged anywhere
from 2,500 to 10,000. The eventual
number will definitely be some-
where in between, probably a little

z

closer to 2,500 than 10,000.

It all makes it quite easy to
overlook the game itself.

“It’s almost too much to com-
prehend,” coach Tim Landis said in
an August press release. “This will
be one of the great moments in

Davidson athletics history.”

Not to mention a grand oppor-
tunity for his Wildcats to possibly
lose focus on the task at hand.

“Hopefully, it won’t be that
much of a distraction,” Eric
Ferguson said. “We're just focus-
ing in on practice and getting the
job done. We'll let the historical
significance take care of itself.”

Other schedule highlights in-
clude the traditional Fall Break game
versus Washington & Lee, a road
contest against Emory & Henry,
and a Homecoming matchup with
Methodist, which dealt Davidson
its only ugly defeat last season.

The slate concludes Nov. 22
with the much-anticipated Tilt in
Tampa with South Florida, which

will effectively begin Davidson’s ©

effort to play a I-AA schedule.

The Bulls, a I-AA scholarship
program in its inaugural year of
competition, boast transfers from
South Carolina, Kentucky, Purdue,
Florida State, Michigan State, and
Duke. .

For the Wildcats, though, the
game will represent a bowl game of
sorts.

“Tt will be a great way to end if
we already have six wins,” Ferguson
said. “Ten games is our regular

schedule, and that’s our bonus
game.”
