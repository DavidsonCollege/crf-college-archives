Sometimes it can be hard to picture profes- .

sors having a life outside the classroom, doing
anything besides sitting at home grading papers
and coming up with torturous new 300-page
reading assignments. On faculty websites,
we’re usually told that Professor XYZ is work-
ing on a paper about the mating habits of Gua-

structure of the United Arab Emirates during
the 1950s. But let’s face it, only a few die-hard
students will ever get around to actually reading
this evidence that our professors don’t just sit
around and plot ways to torpedo our GPAs.
All this rambling does have a point: the
Faculty Art Show, which is now entering its
final week, is an accessible way to see what
some Davidson professors have been up to in

their non-Davidson time.

‘Students who’ve already aie a few art
classes may be familiar with Herb Jackson’s
striking acrylic abstracts, Russ Warren’s in-
triguing oil-on-panel paintings, and Cort
Savage’s sculptures. Works by all of these
professors are currently on display in the Van
Every Gallery (to the left as you enter the VAC).

The Art department has chosen to showcase
visiting assistant professor Ray Kleinlein’s still-

ject matter
life paintings in the Smith Gallery, just across
the hallway. The paintings on display there all
portray ordinary items, like perfume bottles and
a garden hose, in striking detail. Charlotte
Observer art critic Richard Maschal gushed in
his review, “[Kleinlein’s] paintings ofeveryday
objects are refreshing and marvelous.”

The faculty paintings are on display in the
VAC through October 9, 2002.
