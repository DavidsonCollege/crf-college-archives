“Hello Year”...

Every year students at State College ob-
serve what they call “Hello Week.” This
ig a program sponsored by the student
body, designed to promote friendliness and
spirit the
at Davidson pride ourselves upon
fact that
we observe such a week the year ‘round,
We like to think that we know everyone on
the campuS and speak to all we meet. We
attribute much of our famous Wildcat spirit
to that fact.

We like to think that this
friendliness is natural and unaffected,
most of us know that in many
not. There are a few Davidson men,
ot here more than
year, who haye not yet imbibed this spirit.
Perhaps that is our fault. we
haven’t shown them by our example the
value of such a spirit. We can do this by
speaking to everyone with a real warmth
in our tohes, not in a bored or stilted man-
mere

Last week everyone eagerly awaited the

met to decide the fate of Europe. It seems
as though they have decided that peace is

that time.

This is undoubtedly .the first sane move
which Hitler has made since he has assumed
the role of dictator of the Third Reich. He
apparently has been brought to realize that
war at this time will prove more fatal to
the German nation than he had estimated.
With so many of the world powers opposed
to his tactics, the fate of the German people
would be far worse than it was two decades
ago.

The United States, at least, fully realizes
the utter uselessness of war. It is doing

that Hitler, Mussolini and their ilk have
not been so blinded by their quest for glory
that they have forgotten the price paid, for
power.

Home Games?...

Have you too felt a slight resentment
rising within you when you have thought
of those home football games that are not
home games, that are played in Charlotte
or on some fairground in South Carolina?
Personally,
feeling because it seems that we are being
cheated when such a campus activity is re-
moved from the campus.

I have experienced just that

But there are other reasons, felt by the

majority of the students, for this resent-
ment. <A big football game on the campus
is degraded until it is on a level with the
ancient Roman gladiatorial carnivals when
it is carried to a neighboring, but still for-
eign, Lacking there is the spirit of
good sportsmanship and school “patriot-
ism,” and in their places are planted the
seeds of a spirit of greater showmanship.
As in the case of all student affairs, there
is also present the question of finance which
continually hovers over all of us. These off-
the-campus “home games” have tagged on
them an additional admission charge which
comes over and above the campus tax for
athletics, and there is always the added cost
of transportation, unless one is accustomed
to travel “by rule of thumb,” and the cost
of meals eaten away from the boarding-
houses. In this matter, the College has ap-
parently its students because it
has not endeavored to provide them with
athletic contests which they faithfully sup-
port and which they may conveniently at-
tend in their Richardson Field.
However, the blame surely does not rest
wholly upon the College. It seems to me
that greater part of it justly goes to the so-
called “sports promoters” of the nearby-

from the collegiate arenas. And it can

Campus Comments

There seems to be some misunderstand-
ing among members of the Student Body
concerning the Court of Control. I would
like to take this opportunity to express my
personal views concerning its scope and
relation to the Student Body.

Phe duty of the Court is primarily to en-
force freshman regulations. They have been
carefully considered and are of such nature
that freshmen should follow them to the
letter. None of the regulations impose any
undue hardship or ‘are in any way degrad-
ing. The Court also desires to be of service
to members of the freshman class in any
way possible. This katter aspect is one
which I would like to emphasize in order
that it might prdve of greater value.

The Court of Concrol is an agency created
to carry out the will of the Student Body.
It derives its power to act and the authority
to back its actions from the student opinion
of the three upper classes.

With the support and cooperation of the
Student Body, the Court of Control will
function to the best possible advantage
both for freshmen and upperclassmen.

: JULIAN SQUIRES,
’ Judge of the Court.of Control.

P.S.—I request Fred Stair, President of
the Student Body, to write the next Cam-
pus Comments.

tory, gain a broken nose or two,
a few honorable internal injuries,

to this system, on the other hand,
is that Davidson has no business
subjecting its amateurs who play
for sport, to the brutality of a
bunch of professionals. Enough
said, this system can speak for it-
self. Finally, and impracticably

giate football—entirely. Did I say
that was impracticable from the

standpoint of finances and alumni?
That pair of objections is only sec-
ond to the real objection, senti-
mentalism. We don’t seem to be
able to look at the question with:
out thinking of all the ballyhoo
that goes on at a game. We get
choked with emotion when we

think of doing away with such a
time -honored institution as inter
collegiate football; and at the
same time we fail “to realize that
we could @abotish the wrongs of
modern football at the. same time.
There is one solution that I have
not included because the college
has refused to look that way. Dav-
idson could limit itself to compe-
tition with still have
interest enough in the students to

schools who

reserve football for students and not
for professionals. The objection to
this seems to be that such a move
would lower Davidson's position in
the field of education. In favor of
it, I might point out that any other
plan, with the exception of abolish-
ment of football, would lower Dav-
idson’s position in the less worldly
field of sportsmanship.

Davidson can do but one: thing
the college refuses to play
against amateur teams, and that
is to remove the cause of the trou-
ble entirely, intercollegiate football.
The coaches could then devote their
time to the majority of the stu-
dents to whom it really belongs. All
students could indulge in athletics,
and share in their benefits. Under
such a system, college athletics
would be fulfilling their fonction,
the building of men,

RACE
QUESTION ...
Dear Bill:

In editorial last week Erle
Austin objected to the fact that a
Negro was -being made a perma-
nent member of the college band.
IT am inclined to agree with him,
but not for the reasons he named:

an

“Knowing the desire of conserva-
tism that is held by a majority of
our student body .. .”

Perhaps it was conservatism 80-
odd years ago, but now we are al-
most in the middle.of another cen-
tury. The Negroes are no longer
slaves; they are American citizens.
Of course, I can’t blame anyone for
having such an &ttitude if the only
kind of Negro he knows is of the
type under consideration, but we
call this an Age of Progress, an
Era of Learning, so let's get wise
to ourselves.

To get to the point, I
would like to have one good reason
for the attitude we have toward
these people. I once heard a person

down

say that they are “absolutely
worthless.” I violently disagree
with that person and think that

anyone who keeps his eyes and ears
open will be forced to do the same.
Just think of the wonderful contri-
butions they have made in the spir-
ituals, which are loved by all who
have a taste for beautiful music.
Think of Dr. Carver at Tuskeegee;
he has developed a number of val-
uable uses for the peanut shell,
Yes, 75 years ago the attitude
could be termed eonservatism, but
today it is, very mildly
narrow mindedness.

Girls, beautiful girls, pouring onto
the campus from far and near!
Some of them coming to Davidson
dances for the first time and a little
jittery wondering if they will go
over well; others) developing into
full-fledged prom trotters after sev-
eral trips, and keeping the male at-
tentions with a line any freshman
should be able to see through; and
lastly, those who still have the urge
to go collegiate but give out very
little information concerning the
number of years they-have been
going to college functions. Be they
“Campus Widows” or “true to one”
they add a pleasure to college life
that nothing else can replace, Yes,
I'm really all for the sweet young
ladies,

And speaking of dances, let’s ev-
erybody support the Pan-Hellenic
Council this week-end. The profits
on this first set furnish the money
needed to pay pre-dance expenses
of future sets. The way we turn
out for this set will have a direct
bearing on the bands the Council
will be able to secure for later. I
know we all want the best pos-

sible; real support now will greatly
improve the later dances.

It evident that the “Powers
that Be“ failed to read my sugges-
tion about the ventilation at Ves-
pers. Here’s hoping that this col-
umn has improved enough to secure
the attention of those in authority,
because the chapel was really un-
comfortable Sunday night. I re-
peat, “It is a pity to detract from
the beauty of the vesper services
by putting the students in a less
receptive mood for the sermon
when this can be corrected by
merely airing out the chapel well
before church time.”

Prize scholastic achievement of
the week is accredited to Hayseed
Thomas who wrote a perfect defi-
nition for the word “option” placed
before a question on a Polit review.
Hayseed redeemed himself some-
what Saturday, however, by “go-
ing down the line’ with Benny
Harrison.

In the Groove

By TOM PERRIN

\ “

I'LL BET ... Rumor has reached
our ears of a rather preposterous
little wager made by a couple of
undergrads here. “A” as the Polit-
ical Science department would au-
tomatically dub him, approached
the next man in the alphabet yey)
with what was obviously a very
generous proposition. A was of- the
opinion that the sum of all points
that Davidson ran up against op-
ponents this fall would exceed the
product of all her opponents’
scores against her, multiplied to-
gether. In other words, as A point-
ed out, his number of points in the

Citadel and State games would
amount to 12 plus 7, while B's
scores in those games would be 6

times 19—so on through the sea-
son.

B, who knows a good: thing when

he sees it, or

up

who thought he did,
snapped the offer, giving

odds,

nice

B wasn’t feeling so well at last
reports, though. He had just re-
to multiply that score
of zero that Erskine chalked up.

PROGRESS ... Just out ‘of cur-
iosity we looked up the “Davidson-
ian” of ten ago this week.
The idea wasn’t much of a° success
for the columnist’s point of view.
The news hasn't changed much in
ten years, on the whole—there is
just attention paid to alumni
today. Big issue of the moment
the Al Smith-Herb Hoover
presidential race, with local senti-
ment largely on the Brown Derby
side, judging from the jokes. An-
other item was a something about
electricity being left on all night
instead of going off at twelve, cour-
tesy of the college. Time and Day-
idson do march on.

SONGS... Without posing as a
savant in the field of popular mu-
sic, we find ourselves burdened
with a couple of opinions that
ought to be disposed of. First, we
will stick our prophetic neck out
and say that “All Ashore,” a simple
and smooth melody by Billy Hill
who also did “Lights Out,” “The
Old Spinning Wheel,” and others,
will reach the top in a month or
two. Second, we will guess that HY

ANNUAL .. . The “Quips and
Cranks” photographer has started
in again, and that reminds us of
something. We think we remem-
ber the ROTC boys paying some-
thing like a quarter apiece last year
to have some kind of military spon-
sors’ pictures in the annual. We are
almost sure we paid ours, but no-
where in our yearbook can we find
what we supposedly were paying
for. There’s probably a simple ex-
planation, but are mildly cur-
ious still, and we know others who
feel the same way.
