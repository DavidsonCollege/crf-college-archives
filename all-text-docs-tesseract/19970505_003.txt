Amen.

And with that, Larry
Dagenhart, the Chair of the Presi-
dential Search Committee, closed
his prayer, and opened the search
process for Davidson’s 16th college
president. The prayer itself was
typical Dagenhart: humorous and
uplifting, and as we learned later,
much needed.

All 18 members of the committee
realized the formidable task of re-
placing the beloved John
Kuykendall and of selecting a
leader for an institution so dear to
so many. We also realized that any-
one who was to follow Dr.
Kuykendall would need to be a per-
son of great courage, faith, and
character. Unrealistically, we be-
gan this process with the intention
of identifying a person who could
be, from day one, the president John
Kuykendall had become over the
last twelve years.

As you can imagine, the process
was not easy. After screening over
100 applicants, we narrowed the

field consider-
ably before de-
ciding whom
we would
bring to Char-
lotte for inter- —
views. The
two days we
spent at the
Charlotte Air-_
port interview-
ing candidates
were eventful
and enlighten-
ing. Candi-
dates were
constantly
grilled about
their employ-
ment and per-
sonal experi-
ences. As a
committee, we
were trying to
identify the

level of energy
and commitment that one of these
extraordinary people could bring to
avery demanding job. In short, we
were looking for a unique blend of
personality and vision.

We met Bobby Vagt for the first
time as a committee in Charlotte
last October. While we ate our

lunch, we reviewed Bobby’s re-
sume, and remarked over what an
interesting choice a former prison
warden would be. Although ex-
tremely impressive, his resume was
not that of the prototypical college
president. Then again, Davidson is
not your prototypical college.

So with an open mind, we wel-
comed this Davidson alumnus and
immediately realized what makes
him so successful. We saw a man
short in stature but big in heart, full
of enthusiasm, humor and an un-
questionable love for his alma
mater. Over the next hour and a
half, we learned of Bobby Vagt’s
business acumen, his dedication to
the Presbyterian Church, and his
unwavering support of Davidson as
a fundraiser, parent and alumnus.
After sharing many good laughs,
we bid him farewell.

Many months later, as the Search
Committee focused their thoughts
on who would be the best person
for Davidson College, Bobby
Vagt’s name surfaced again. After
meeting with and discussing can-
didates with stronger academic
records, we came to a decision.
This was the defining moment, and
it is what makes Davidson so spe-
cial. We decided that we could not
proceed with any of our other can-
didates because they did not have a
strong enough connection to
Davidson College. We wanted
someone who knows and loves
Davidson. We wanted someone

with an appreciation for our heri-

Bill Giduz

tage, and someone who possessed
the ability to lead us into the 21st
century. We found these things in
Bobby Vagt.

As students, we admired Bobby’s
willingness to listen and his genu-
ine concern for student life on cam-
pus. We were convinced that
Bobby, just as his predecessor,
would be a students’ president.
Moments before the decisive vote,
a member of the committee sum-
marized that quality all of us
deemed vital. “Through his life of
leadership and service, Bobby Vagt
represents what Davidson College
seeks to produce.” By entrusting
Davidson College to Bobby Vagt’s
leadership, we are not only affirm-
ing our pride in our tradition, we
are displaying our belief in our-
selves, and in our own futures.
During his visit to campus Friday,
we hope that the rest of the student
body was able to see the special in-
dividual we students helped to se-
lect to lead Davidson. He not only
toured every corner of the campus
to meet people, but he also took off
his shirt to play basketball with a
group of students, and he stayed at
the ice cream social until the last
students finished eating.

We are proud to have fulfilled our
responsibility of bringing a new
president to Davidson College. We
hope that you will fulfill yours by
joining the community to help make
his transition a smooth one.

Now, in typical Larry Dagenhart
fashion, we. wish the Davidson
community and the Vagt family
godspeed. Amen.
