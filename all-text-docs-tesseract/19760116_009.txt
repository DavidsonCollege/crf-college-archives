SENIOR JAY POWELL goes up for -Pete Goodman

two points in Tuesday's 77-68

victory over Furman.

Cats thwart Pare

By PAUL BANTA
Staff Writer

The Davidson Wildcats won
their first conference match
Tuesday in a 77-68 victory
over the Paladins of Furman.

This contest was a crucial
one for both teams, as both are
in the middle of a rebuilding
year and are seeking to make a
turn-around. Going in to this
game each team only had three
victories; Davidson had nine

' * losses to Fuman’s seven.

The Wildcats came out
ready to play and to display

their improvemnet. Davidson
forged to an early 27-19 lead
on a Jay Powell jump shot
with 7:43 left in the first half.

The Wildcats hit on 51.7%
of their shots in the first
twenty minutes, but the
shooting and rebounding of
Furman’s Ray Miller, who had
17 points and 10 rebounds at
halftime, pulled the Paladins
to a 35-33 lead at the halfway
mark.

Davidson finally put both
shooting and rebounding to-
gether in the final period, and
the Wildcats actually surged

An interview
with
COACH BO BRICKELS
By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Assistant Sports Editor

In a recent interview I asked
Coach Bo Brickels a number of
pertinent questions about his
coaching methods and about
the team in general. Here are
my questions and his replies:

Question: Coach Brickels, it

has been a disappointing sea-
son for the fans so far and
many of them are beginning to
question why things have
gotten off to such a slow start.

Brickels: You've got to rea-:
lize that if you’re 9-3 they
aren’t asking too many quest-
ions--that’s the way it works.

Q: To begin with many
people feel that you have
played the freshmen too much
and that the team’s lack of
experience is reflected in our
record.

B: We play the freshmen
because we think-they are the
best players. We go with the
people we feel we have the best
opportunity to win with.

Also we are in a situation
where werhave to play the
freshmen. Maybe we rushed a
couple of them but we’ve
backed off a little now.

Q: But why aren’t Kevin
Doherty and Tom Verlin play-
ing more?

B: Both of course missed
some early work and conse-
quently got themselves be-
hind. Kevin is probably the
most talented athelete we have
now but the one quality that

_Kevin suffers from I think is

gamesmanship--knowledge of
the game. I realize that the
only way you can get that sort
of thing is thru playing expe-
rience if indeed you can ever
learn that sort of thing.

He’s not real sure offen-
sively...what to do, when to
take it to the basket, when to
pass it off. The very reason
Tom Jorganson played so
much earlier are the reasons
K.D. doesn’t always play a
lot. Defensively Kevin is fine
and there are times when I
think he can play. But in
situations like against the
zone...that takes care of Ke-
vin.

Tom Verlin suffered from a
weight problem and got it
down before Christmas and he
played 11 minutes against
Ohio State and ten against
Georgia Tech. But when he
came back from Christmas
break he was overweight
again. He weighs 211 pounds
and he’s supposed to weigh
193 pounds. You say we need

his talent and you’re damn
right we need his talent--and
his experience--but you’ve got
to draw the line somewhere.
It’s not a matter of ability or
putting out or attitude in
either case.

Q: It’s often been said that a

person with more experience

will beat a talented player.

B: I think that that’s a good
point. As everyone knows
experience is invaluable. We
badly need the experience that
Verlin can give us but because
of pure talent you must find a
way to develop that experience
in the more talented indivi-
duals. |

Q: Because you play the
freshmen so much many peo-
ple have begun to accuse you
of forgetting this season in
order to prepare for the future.

B: I don’t think that is
true--we play to win. I like to
have done a little better sure
but for all intentions and
purposes our season is in the
next three games. We’re not

seems that instead of const-

pure criticism. Wouldn’t

to a 13 point lead, 65-52, after
guard Tom Jorgenson glided
in on consecutive layups with
6:37 left in the contest.

Not to be undone: the
Paladins slowly crawled back
to within three points with
only 1:29 left untill Jim. Rice
sank a crucial free throw and
Powell added five insurance
points in the last 33 seconds.
His layup at the buzzer settled
the Davidson Victory margin
at nine points.

pace, while the Paladins hit
only 38.6% of their attempts.
Jay Powell led the Davidson
scoring with 15 points, while

Miller who netted a game high
30 points, while pulling down
15 rebounds. Freshman center
Jim Strickland scored 18
points and he had 11 re-
