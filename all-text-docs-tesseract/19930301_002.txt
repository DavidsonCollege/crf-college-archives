Davidson Welcomes Back its First Black Graduates

By Alice Felmlee

Many Davidson graduates go
onto become pioneers in their own
fields; yet few enter the college as
true pioneers. Wayne Crumwell
and Marian Perkins did just that.
As Davidson’ s first African Ameri-
can male and female freshmen,
and eventual graduates, the two
took major steps onto an all white
Southern campus.

Returning to their alma mater
as part of Black History Month,
Crumwell and Perkins shared
memories of the Davidson they
had known and expressed some
hopes for its future.

It took Crumwell only fifty
minutes to relive his college expe-
rience on Tuesday night. The
Reidsville, North Carolina lawyer
spoke of the Davidson personali-

ties who had influenced him most
and the truths he had been told.
These truths did not arise from
lectures of class discussions but
rather from campus life — this was
perhaps, the best education.

Throughout his four years at
Davidson, Crumwell chose to be-
lieve the words of the then Admis-
sions Director, H. Edmonds White.
“He told us we were here for the
benefit of white students. They
needed to be exposed. It would be
an awesome service that we could
perform for them.”

The contrast between black
and white was to be acourse in life,
and Crumwell the improptu pro-
fessor. Only later in his talk did the
speaker suggest his ownagreement
to such a metaphor: “It was hard
for me to understand how Davidson

students could be so intelligent yet
so different from meas far as value
systems.”

While therace relations which

"He told us we were here
for the benefit of white
students. They needed
to be exposed. It would
be an awesome Service

that we could
perform for them."
-Wayne Crumwell

Crumwell spoke of did not reflect
the violence and outrage present
on many college campuses at the
time, the joy felton campus on the
eve of Dr. Martin Luther King’s
assassination linked Davidson to

the tensions beyond the life of a
student.

“I remember going toa [white]
friend’s room the night Dr. King
was killed," reminisced Crumwell.
“We sat there sharing a bottle of
Johnny: Walker Red as we talked
of the imminent race war, the real-
ity that we would be on opposing
sides and the fear that we might
one day doeach other bodily harm.”

Crumwell feels that his time
here instructed him in the real
world, racism included.

Davidson’s first black male
graduate eventually gained a sense
of his own abilities. It was Dr.
McCormick who taught him to
appreciate those abilities, and
Davidson’s own Lefty Drisell who
instilled in him a hope for im-
proved race relations.

Marian Perkins shared many
themes with Crumwell. While
outward racism was not so appar-
ent, subtle hints of its presence did
not go unnoticed by her. Profes-
sors who encouraged her to join
their departments so that they might
have a black student in their ranks,
and a theater production which
depicted African Americans in a
displeasing light made their points.

Coming all the way from At-
lanta to share her college experi-
ences with a younger generation of
Davidsonians, Perkins used the fi-
nal moments of her talk to encour-
age students have deeply commit-
ted. faith and to promote encour-
aged race relations. "I am deeply
committed to my religion and don't
feel the need to judge failure and
success using the normal rules."

French Foreign Legion Captain Describes War in Croatia

By Jeff Oller

Few peopleare willing to stand

up and literally fight for a cause.
. Anyone can talk big but considera
person who picks up a gun and
. fights in a war for the freedom of

another country.

Colton Perry, asophomore at
Old Dominion University, is such
a person. He recently fought for
Croatia in their war against Serbia,
and spoke to the Davidson com-
munity Thursday in the 900 Room.

A life abroad and full of mili-
tary involvement has been in his
plans for along time. At the age of
fifteen, he moved to France. Four
years later, mesmerized by stories
of the French Foreign Legion, he
decided to join their ranks.

Joining a parachute regiment
and finishing third out of a large
training class, Perry soon found
himself fighting inChad. Heended
up fighting on both sides of the war
at different times. .

In October of 1991, he joined

the Croatian Army Special Forces.
After nearly eight months of fight-
ing, Perry was shot in the leg while
trying toevacuate civilians to safer
territory. At this time he and two
other Croatian fighters were cap-
tured by Yugoslavian forces.

It was not until four months
later and countless hours of con-
finement and beatings that Perry
was returned to Croatia. He was
traded for three Serbian pilots at
the U.S. Embassy and subsequently
freed.

Through all of this Perry in-
sists that he is a “pretty down to
earth person," and insists that he
did not fight in Croatia as a merce-
nary. His motivation was quite
simple: a strong belief in the
Croatian cause. He was not well
paid and never expected any sort
of compensation.

Although he does not want to
point any fingers, Perry believes
the main antagonist in this war is
quite obvious. “Afterall, Serbia

itself coined the term ‘ethnic
cleansing’ to describe what it was
doing.”

Citing the fact that the Serbians
are not well-trained for war com-
bat, this Croatian fighter believes
that his forces will prevail. Look-
ing to our nation’s capital, Perry
mentioned the growing concern
which has been mounting because
of America’s lack of involvement
in the area.

To this he offered a few sug-
gestions. "By enforcing the no fly
zone over Croatia, lifting the em-
bargo, and actively supporting the_

Bosnian, government, the United —

States could help the Croatians re-
capture the land whichis rightfully
their own,” said Perry.

Because he remains a captain
in the Croatian Army on reserve
Status, Perry plans to return to
Croatia thissummer. He intends to
aid in the training of recruits and to
eventually obtain Croatian citizen-
ship.

Campus Questions Statement of Purpose

Changes continued from page I

guage that could fairly be consid-
ered exclusive.”

Dr. McKelway serves on the
sub-committee with Dr. Ben Klein,
Professor of Mathematics, Larry
Dagenhart, Charlotte attorney and
Trustee, and Rev. William Wood,
Senior Minister of Charlotte First
Presbyterian Church and Trustee.
The committee will present sug-
gestions for change to the Trustees
inthe spring or summer; the Trust-
ees will then vote to determine
whether or not to adopt the alter-
ations.

According to Dr. McKelway,
the Statementof Purpose “‘is lodged
inthe ByLaws of the Trustees. Itis
not a faculty document though we
will be able to help draft and craft
the statement.” McKelway states
also that student and faculty con-
cers will be considered but the
final vote belongs solely to the
Trustees.

The issue is being addressed
by the Council on Minority Affairs
chaired by Junior DeVane Tidwell.
Tidwell says, “Davidson wants to

be considered a school with high .

academic standards and professes
to espouse cultural diversity. If

this is the case, then it must be
embodied within such official
school documents as the Statement
of Purpose.” The Council plans to
propose particular changes for ap-
proval by the Student Government
which will in turn propose the

. changes to the Trustee’s sub-com-

mittee.

Tidwell “urges all students to
at least take time to actually ingest
the Statement which can be found
in the opening pages of the college
catalog.” The current Statement
has not been changed since 1962
before minorities or women were
admitted. Pertinent suggestions
can be made to any Council of
Minority Affairs or SGA represen-
tative.

Anni Kirkland, sophomore
representative to the council, com-
ments that, “the committee feels
that the Statement of Purpose is
not true in the way Davidson is
now and itcontrasts what Davidson
is hoping to be.” She suggests that
the primary concern involves re-
moving the more overt references
to Christianity to incorporate more
religious and cultural diversity.

Not all students agree on the
necessity to change the Statement
of Purpose. “I would like to fulfill

the Statement of Purpose as it is
now, but it is hypocritical because
student lifedoesn’trevolvearound
Christian ethics,” says freshman
SGA Senator Bo Bartholomew.
“We have two choices: One,
change the Statement of Purpose
to meet what we are now, or two,
change the lives of Davidson stu-
dent to meet the Statement of Pur-
pose."

Dr. McKelway does not fore-
see any tremendous change\of

meaning for the statement. He

emphasizes the possible change of
language to better portray the goals
of the college. “The desire is not
to reinvent or erase the Statement
of Purpose. The issue is one of
improvement and change.”

SGA President Alden Smith
who also serves on the Council on
Minority Affairs, states, “the aim
is not to de-Christianize the docu-
ment but to make it more represen-
tative of the students and faculty.

“The statement that
Davidson’s primary purpose is to
develop persons of Christian char-
acter is simply not true. I think any
religious professor will back me
up on that.”
