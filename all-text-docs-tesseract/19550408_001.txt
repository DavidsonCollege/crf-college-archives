Trustees Make Plans|*
For the Restoration
Of Old Quadrangle

According to President Cunning-
ham, the Board of Trustees has
had in writing for some time now
plans to restore the original quad-
rangle as the Woodrow Wilson
Fine Arts Center, in honor of the
scholarly President, who was a
student at Davidson in 1873-74.

The proposed restoration would
be particularly appropriate in the
near future because next year is |

the 100th anniversary of Wilson’s
birth. At Staunton, Va., Wilson’s

birthplace, plans are underway for
a large anniversary celebration
next year, and Davidson College
has been invited to participste, in
view of the fact that Wilson was
a student here and made his first
speech in the Eumanean Literary
Society hall.

The proposed restoration would
involve a number of major
changes in the present set up of
the quadrangle. The unattractive
stucco would be removed from
Shearer Hall, and the building
would be made to face the church.
The Eumanean and Philanthropic
Literary Society halls would be
cast in a more permanent form,
along with the removal of the fire-
house red paint.

Two small dorms would probably
be constructed, thus completing
Oak and Elm Row, which in the
early years housed the student
body. The music office buildings
would probably remain where
they are, with the church, of
course, completing the quadrangle.
All of the architectural work
would be in the original neo-classic
style.

When finished, the buildings
would have student facilities for
the study of music, art, drama,
and speech. Interest in helping to
make the restoration has been
shown by friends of the college.

Business-Eco Club Plans

Program On

As a climax to a year of ener-
getic growth the Business-Eco-
nomics Association is planning a
meeting Tuesday, April 12, at 8
p.m., in the Ballroom of the Col-
lege Union based on the theme of
the extent of monopoly in Ameri-
can business.

From Boston and Charlottesville
the association has obtained two
outstanding authorities with wide
experience in national economics
and governmental relations to busi-
ness as principle speakers for the
program. The discussion will not
be limited to the topic, but those
in the audience can ask the speak-
ers questions on the myriad sub-
jects upon which they are quali-
fied.

Dr. Corwin D. Edwards, present-
ly a professor of economics dt the
University of Virginia, has held
numerous positions as an econom-
ist in government service. From
1946 until 1953 Dr. Edwards was
the director of the Bureau of In-
dustrial Economics associated with
the Federal Trade Commission.

Earlier he served as economic

FULLY FURNISHED

Two Top Floors Of Belk
Set For Completion Soon

With two floors of the new Belk
Dormitory scheduled for comple-
tion before Spring Frolics, work-
men have been busy fitting lino-
leum and trimming around doors
and windows on the third and
fourth floors.

Mrs. R. A. Little, Supervisor of
Dormitories, is pleased with the
progress being made and Is enjoy-
ing selecting drapés and other ap-
pointments for the rooms.

Included in plans for the first
floor is a new office for the House-
mother. Near the front entrance
is also a room reserved for the
student body president, if he de-
sires.

Belk is to be primarily a junior
and senior dorm. It is Mrs. Little's
hope to keep noise and confusion
in the dorm at a minimum, and
rooms are assigned with this pur-
pose in mind.

Each floor contains a built-in
telephone booth with buzzer sys-
tems connecting the rooms from
the booth. Students will be per-
mitted to bring easy chairs and
extra tables as usual with them,
but bar bells and weights will be
frowned upon. Students have the
choice between twin beds or double
bunks, as long as the choice is
available. The college already pos-
sesses an ample supply of beds,

and no new frames will be pur.
chased at this time.

Furnished in each room is a
sink, built-in closet and chest of
drawers, medicine cabinet with
cork screw attached, micarta
covered desks with florescent
lamps, and new desk chairs. Built
in book cases are provided above
the desk, giving a well organized
work area.

The first and third floors are
being finished a light blue-green
color with black scuff board trim
around the floor. On the second
and fourth floor a light yellow tint
is used.

Before students move in next
fall, Belk will be well broken in
by visiting groups. Scheduled for
May 6 and 7, the North Carolina
Academy of Science is to be housed
in the dorm, as well as a high
schoo) student leadership confer-
ence May 13 and 14. The Men of
the Church in the Synod of North
Carolina are planning to use the
quarters for their meetings early
in June.

Mr. D. G. Martin, Treasurer of
the College, is confident that the
investment in the new Belk dorm
is one that will greatly benefit the
overall plant of Davidson in the
spirit of the college as well as in
physical attractiveness.

Red Cross Collects
232 Pints of Blood

During the Davidson Xollege
Blood Drive which was held on

April 6 and 7, a total of 232 pints

were collected.

This spring semester's blood
drive, sponsored by the Interfra-
ternity Council, received approxi-
mately 25 pints more than the
drive last fall. The drive was open
to townspeople, faculty members
and students.

Even though the Interfraternity
Council offered a $1.00 discount
on the dance tickets for Spring
Frolics for each member of the
fraternity that gave the most blood,
the response wasn't too good com-
pared to the fall semester drive
of 1953 when 405 pints were given.

Blood coliected in “the mobile
unit will be transferred to the
Mecklenburg County blood bank
where it is distributed free of
charge by the Red Cross. Approxi-
mately 65 pints were used last year
in the Davidson community alone.
In cases of emergency the bank
in Charlotte is ready to supply
necessary quotas to disaster areas.

A number of community women
voluntarily helped the Red Cross
conduct the blood drive.

tuition, and books.

Vespers Will Feature
Program of Music

Vespers this week will consist
of a program of special music in
place of the usual sermon.

Selections of Easter music will
be presented by Mrs. Virginia
Smith Sinclair, soprano from Char-
lotte, Mr. Philip Gehring, organist.
and the Male Chorus and Chapel
Choir under the direction of Mr.
Plott.

Patterned after the traditional
Christmas Vespers service, Sun-
day’s program will be a new ap-
proach to the celebration of
Easter. The Christmas ceremony
has always been very greatly en-
joyed by both students and faculty,
and it is hoped that this modifica-
tion for Easter will be equally well
received.

There will be no reader as in
the Christmas service, but the
selections will center around the
Easter story. With ao carefully ar-
ranged program, there is a great
variety of presentations from solos
to choral works and from canons
to classic hymns.

Although only a portion of the
worship service, this sermon of
music is expected to be an im-
pressive celebration of Easter Sun-
day.

Brinkerhoff, a junior from Mon. —
treat, N.C.. and a member of Kap-
pa Sigma social fraternity, said
that the “Y must step from the
crowd and initiate a more effective
program.” He proposed that
the YMCA, to be more effective,

‘should hold regular and well pre-

pared meetings of its membership
and should publish in circular form
its goals and activities—to let peo-
ple “know what the YMCA is do-
ing.” He also put himself in favor
of exchanging ideas with other
YMCAs and in entering the David-
son YMCA athletic events with
nearby YMCAs.

. Mauze, a rising senior, is a mem.

ber of Kappa Alpha social frater.
nity and ts from San Antonio, Tex.
He attacked the past YMCA pro-
grams for failing to attract many
members of the student body who
were not pre-ministerial. He pro-
posed that the Y should go after
the doubters and seoffers, and
bring into the program talented
Students who have so far been
passed up. He put himself in favor
of “Y" sponosred program that
would be on subjects in which
the students are interested. In
general, Mauze said he favored
“making the Y more interested in
everybody, and everybody more in-
terested in the Y.”

Balloting for the other unde-
cided YMCA offices resulted in a
run-off in both races. Gordon Bon-
durant and Vernon Hunter are the
remaining candidates in the race
for YMCA Vice President, while
Joe Sandifer and Dan Woods are
in the run-off for the secretarial

office. Voting will continue for
