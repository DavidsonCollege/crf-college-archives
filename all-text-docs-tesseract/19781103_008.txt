Bad checks from students plague many merchants

By J. W. ARETINO

Last year the only challenge
to basketball bouncing in John-
ston gymnasium was student
checks bouncing in area stores.

Some wondered if a new
scourge had hit the campus,
others pointed to the under-
world as the efficient and final
cause, while still others simply
thought students were testing
Economics 101 dogma by seeing
if indeed they could create
money and stimulate the econ-
omy in the finest Keynesian
tradition.

With the beginning of ano-
ther academic year, students
when writing checks were
scorned, bantered, scoffed, fin-
gerprinted, harried, and some-
times their checks were even
accepted. Enrollment at David-
son College didn’t seem to
matter anymore to merchants
who seemed so partial to the
students before.

merchants were asked about the
problem of “‘insufficient funds”
checks.

at the Seven-Eleven, store said

problem this year. No longer is

everything from hjs shoe size to
his Alpha number to his laun-
dry number to cash a check. A
phone number or local address
will usually suffice.

Every merchant contacted
had a “pseudo-panic button,”
namely Will Terry’s phone
number.

If threats of prosecution &nd
loss of checking privileges were
not enough to frighten even the
hard-core J-walkers on campus,
the wrath and vengence of the
Dean of Students possibly was.
In the case of the 7-11, bank
errors accounted for several of
the checks bouncing.

Ace Hardward Store, said he

checks. He only remembers one
check not going through. “That
check was for $1.64, and the
student had closed out his
checking account the day be-
fore.”

Wesley Greene, manager at
Harris Teeter, said only a few
student checks come back and
this usually occurs at the end of
the year just before school
recesses for the-summer.

Sam Caldwell, the store ma-
nager at Cashions, says he
wished all his checks were from
Davidson students. ‘I’ve lost

The Student Government
Association sponsors a Bad -
Check Committee, begun in
1976, that serves .as a liaison
between student offenders and
complaining businesses.

The committee takes much of
the “busy work” involved off
Will Terry’s shoulders. Al-
though the Dean of Students
Office does not always work
through the committee, it is
often asked to chase down
difficult cases.

“Best food east of Tulsa”

By SID BARRETT
Staff Writer

This week’s Fine Film fea-
tures the talents of two of
Italy’s greatest film directors,
Roberto Rossini and Vittorio de
Sica, here in what is perhaps his

Filmed in Italy in 1959, General
Della Rovere is a powerful
statement of not only the
individual responsibility but the .
Ttalian conscience as well, in the
Second World War.

The action takes place during
the waning years of the War. As
the Italian front collapsed be-
fore the American drive up ‘the
Italian peninsula the Germans
assumed control of Italy mili-
tarily and politically. The occu-
pation of their ally was often
brutal, especially in Rome..

De. Sica plays a petty thief,
an opportunist who plays both
sides against each other. He is
arrested and then forced by the
Nazis to impersonate a jailed
Italian partisan leader, in an
effort to gain information about °
the Resistence underground.

As De Sica gains the trust
and support of his ‘‘comrades,”
he begins to assume some of the
characteristics of the General.
Finally, his role leads him to a
-confrontation between his own
interests and those of his coun-
trymen.

The film is in Italian with
English subtitles and begins at
8:00 Wednesday night, in Love
