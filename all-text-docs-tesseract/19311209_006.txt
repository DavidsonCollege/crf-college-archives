BLACK MAJESTY
A Book Review

Black Majesty, John W. Vandercook. Harper
and Brothers, N. Y.

Book reviews should, I suppose, confine

themselves to books available to those by whom |
the review is read. Here is a fine bit of his- |
tory and biography in our own library and |
. Short enough to read on a Sunday afternoon.
Vandercook, who makes a specialty of the
negro, and who writes in a fascinating man-
ner, is familiar to many readers of the “Na-
tional Geographic” and “Harper's.” His excel-
lent story, Djombe River, appeared in this last
named magazine several years ago.

The title page of Black Majesty states that
the book is a life of Christophe, King of Haiti,
but actually it is a gripping story of three truly

great black men. Accounts of the rise and fall
of Toussaint L’Ouverture and his friend Jean |
Jacques Dessalines are necessary as a back- |
ground for the remarkable story of Christophe. |

Haiti today is an island that has slipped far |
into “stupor and dirt and dreamlessness.” A|
hundred years ago a king who had been born |
a slave created a nation there toward which |
the wondering eyes of the world were turned. |
“There was a theater in the Cap aud there |
were schools. No one was indolent or dirty, for
indolence and filth were forbidden by the
Factories were busy and the bay was. filled |
with ships. The great plain between the hills |
was a sugar field, the finest in the world, its |
area measured by hundreds of square miles. |
Along the roads out of the town, roads bedded |
evenly with gleaming white stones, were planta- |
tions owned by negroes who bore with dignity
the titles of duke and baron and count.” The |
armies of this king drove the best Napoleon |
had to offer into the ocean. He, in one year |
established a stable system of exchange in
country which had for years been torn and |
ravaged by war. He did this by taking
the only product. that remained
the civil struggles, gourds,
sands of them, and to this day the principal
coin of Haiti js called the “gourde.” His pal-
ace, “Sans Souci,” had a marble front, and his |
troops astonished a British admiral who paid
an official call. His citadel, a massive work of
masonry on the top of a mountain three thou-
sand feet high, remains to this day one of the
marvels of the Americas. All this by

of his address as “Education versus Pedagogy.”

The university dean did not make his attack
and let it rest at that. He offered an alternative,
which he said might be a ten-year plan, a
twenty-year plan, or a life-time plan. Essen-
tially and summarily it was that secondary
schools, the college and the graduate college
would act and interact upon each other in a
dependent way that would bring about “stand-
