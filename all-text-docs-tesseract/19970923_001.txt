The students have spoken.

In a poll conducted Wednesday
and Thursday by the Davidsonian,
48 percent of the 382 students who
responded said they had lost some
measure of faith in the Honor Code
and/or Code of Responsibility be-
cause of Ryan Gist’s public trial
Tuesday in the 900 Room.

“It wasn’t an Honor Code case,
soit’s rather confusing that it would
lessen their faith in the Honor Code,”
Dean of Students Tom Shandley
said when reached in his office Fri-
day afternoon.

“It’s probably misunderstood
among the student body about

what’s Honor Code and what’s Code
of Responsibility. It shouldn’t be a
mystery.”

“That’s about what I expected,”
Gist said Sunday..“‘I think for some
people, because of the decision, it
strengthened their faith in the Honor
Code.

“Maybe they didn’t understand
that it really shouldn’t have gone
that far.”

According to the poll, 85.2 per-
cent of students thought the matter
should never have been brought to
trial by the Dean of Students Office..
Only 56 participants agreed with
the administration’s decision to try
Gist.

“That’s about right on the money
there,” Gist said. “It shows there is

a serious problem is what it shows.”

“What (he) Gist was charged with
was Social Responsibility,”
Shandley explained. “Did his be-
havior reflect personal maturity, did
it conform to a high standard of
courtesy and propriety, which is
what the Code says?”

Still, all but 12 — 96.8 percent —
of the near 400 students polled
agreed with the Honor Council’s
verdict.

“That surprises me, actually” Gist
said, “that anybody could have
wanted to convict me.”

When asked if he agreed,
Shandley replied, “No comment.”

“Because I don’t want to second
guess the process,” he added. “The
process worked.”

An estimated one-third of the
College’s student population
crammed into the 900 Room Tues-
day night for the first open Honor
Code hearing of the year. The last
open hearing, in the spring of 1997,
drew only a small crowd because it
opened up at the last minute, ac-
cording to Charlotte Hildebrand,
Chairperson of the Honor Council.

“I was so excited that people
came,” defendant Ryan Gist said
after the proceedings. ‘Because
people say that our generation’s so
apathetic, and this issue brought
about such response. People weren’t
coming here to see me. They were
coming here because I’ m being pros-
ecuted for something that shouldn’t
be prosecuted, something that they
believe in.”

When asked why he requested
an open hearing, Gist said, “If I was
going to go down, I wanted the
school to see me go.down.”

“We were not expecting a
crowd,” said Deepa Kamath, one of
the six Honor Council members who
conducted the trial. “We were, in
fact, worried about it being a prob-
lem as far as setting the tone of the
entire trial. Basically, we were
worried about the pressure, and the
distracting behavior and the flags.

“T didn’t appreciate that. We
were concerned about how the So-
licitors were going to handle the

situation. It seemed that people
came in against the Honor Coun-
cil.”

Said Damon Colbert, one of
the two Defense Advisors: “We
were expecting the crowd because
Ryan told us that he had been adver-
tising. I thrive off of crowds like
that, so the energy just helped us. It
just made us rise to the occasion.”

“In a way, the crowd kind of
made me nervous,” said Katie
Nelson, another Council member.
“But I wasn’t so nervous that I
couldn’t do my job. I totally felt
like it was everyone against us. We
are there to protect the student body
or protect Ryan, and I felt that it was
unfair of people to be hostile.”

“I knew a lot of people were
coming,” said Josie Hoover, one of
the two Student Solicitors. “But I
don’t think you can feel the effects
of the sheer numbers until you’re
there, and you’re surrounded by
people, and they’re all just staring
at you. Especially with us, because
I felt like so many people were just
against us.”

Gist, a senior ROTC cadet, was
charged: with violating Section III
of the Code of Responsibility after
removing the American flag from
the Davidson Post Office Sept. 4.
He requested the open hearing after
refusing to submit to the Judicial
Committee almost two weeks ago.

Koestner addresses Davidson date rape policy and protocol

By JessicA GOODSON
News Editor

Katie Koestner sat down with
students, faculty, and administra-
tion Wednesday to offer criticism
of the College’policy and procedure
for sexual misconduct.

“Policy should be educational,”
Koestner said, “All I know is what
I read. If it’s not in the handbook, I
don’t know it.”

Under the current policy, sexual
misconduct consists of sexual as-
sault— including rape — and sexual
harassment. Sexual assault is de-
fined as any assault, “regardless of

whether penetration occurs, if it in-
cludes the unwanted touching of an
intimate part of another person.”

Koestner pointed out that the
terminology of this definition is
ambiguous. “Unwanted touching”
implies that it is the potential
recipient’s responsibility to make it
clear whethertouching is unwanted,
whereas Koestner believes that it is
the initiator’s responsibility to find
out if touching is wanted.

She preferred to define sexual
assault as sexual activity where the
activity is not consented to by both
parties. In turn, “consent,” Koestner
said, “should be given parameters.”

For instance, is silence the
equivalent of consent?

If Norma Davidson consented
last Friday, is that consent appli-
cable this Friday?

If a person is reputedly promis-
cuous, is there unspoken consent?

Asking questions suchas these,
Koestner said, is imperative for cre-
ating a sensible policy.

The current Davidson policy
does not explain how to determine
if consent is given. In addition,
Davidson’s policy does not describe
situations which involve minors or
mentally or physically incapacitated
partners.

Physical incapacitation is a
particular problem on college cam-
puses. One can easily be incapaci-
tated by alcohol, which is involved
in 90 percent of sexual assaults.
Although the degree of inebriation
is ultimately individual, there are
three official stages: intoxicated,
impaired, and finally, incapacitated.

Cases where both parties are
incapacitated are particularly tough
to judge.

“This is where the initiator/re-
cipient roles come into play,” said
Koestner. “If Norma is drunk and
her best friend pulls up in his new
Porshe and says ‘go ahead and take
