Three Students Will Visit
Haverford On Exchange

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Under the student exchange
program three students will
go to Haverford College.
Haverford. Pa.. Joe Kilpat-
rick told the Student Council
Monday.

Kilpatrick, chairman of the
Student Exchange commit-

tee. said that he, Pat Mullen
and George Penick, all sopho-
mores, would go to Haverford
‘sometime in February.” He
said details were not yet
complete, but he hopes. to
make the trip the first week-
end in February.

‘‘We want to encourage stu-
dents and faculty members to

Criticism Given

ROTC Training

Compulsory Reserve Offi-
cer Training Corps programs
are meeting stiff opposition
at schools other than David-
son.

The faculty at Furman Uni-
versity in Greenville, S. C.
voted Monday to take aca-
demic credit away from the
ROTC there.

Their decision must be rati-
fied by the school's trustees
later this year. .-

At Boston University the
faculty voted in December to
drop academic credit for:
military training courses in
Septmeber. 1968.

Northeastern University.
also in Boston, abolished cam-
pus ROTC last spring.

Howard University. a pre-
dominantly Negro institution
in Washington. D. C., dropped
compulsory ROTC after a
student sit-in at the univer-
Sity president's office in No-
vember.

Students at the university
may still take the course.
however. The Howard trus-
tees decided to drop the mili-
tary program. in spite of the
fact that the university re.
Ceives large amounts of gen-
era) support funds from the
government.

Four years ago the United
States Congress dropped the
requirement that. all students
at land-grant institutions
must take ROTC during their
freshman and sophomore

ia

years. There are still pro-
grams at 246 colleges, but
only a few make it compul-
sory in the first two years.
During the past year ROTC
has come under attack on
many campuses, because the
training usually receives of-
ficial academic credit even
though the curriculum is set
y the military and is.beyond
e control of the faculty.

Defenders of the ROTC pro-
gxam have usually argued
that if students want such a
program the university
should provide it.

At Stanford University the
ROTC courses have been
opened up to people, includ-
ing women, who do not plan

.to go on to serve in the Army.
.A number of these “guests”
have enrolled.

Some say they enrolled in
the courses because they
want to challenge the as-
sumptions of the military.
while others say they enrolled
only to learn more about
military science.

The university got special
clearance from the Depart.
ment of Defense to offer the
courses to people other than
candidates for commissions.
However. a ROTC spokes-
man in Washington said there
is nothing wrong with a uni-
versity’s opening up a mili-
tary science course covering
men and women who will only
attend the classroom phase
of the course.

confer with us before we
leave,’ he said. ‘‘if they
would like us to check on any
particular aspect of the col-
lege. For example, one mem-
ber of the English depart-
ment has asked me to find out
how the freshman English
program is handled at Haver-
ford.”

Kilpatrick said Haverford
was chosen because of its
similarity to Davidson. He
said students from Haverford
may also visit Davidson in
February to complete the ex-
change. This will be the first
exchange trip of the year.

Along similar lines, Coun-
cil President Tom Earnhardt
suggested that the council
send several delegates to one
or more conferences which
are being sponsored by other
colleges this spring. The
IMPACT symposium at Van-
derbilt University was men-
tioned as one possibility.

Joe Murphy asked whether
this would be ‘‘just a pleasure
trip" or if the student body
would derive some real bene-
fit from the trip. “I think the
student body ought to receive
the value from the money
they supply the Student Coun-
cil,” he added.

Earnhardt said the dele-
gates could present an Open
End to discuss with students
the speeches and programs at
the conference. He also said
that “by keeping their eyes
and ears open" the delegates
could formulate some ‘worth-
while projects for the school.

A final decision on the mat-
ter was postponed until the
next meeting.

In other council business,
Earnhardt announced that
Rep. James Gardner, R-N.C.,
and Rep. Nick Galifianakis,
D-N.C., have both declined
invitations to speak at David-
son second semester. They
both said that heavy - work
schedules prevented their
coming to Davidson.

The council decided to hold
elections for the president of
the College Union and the So-
cial Council the second week
in February. This will allow
the new presidents to attend a
block booking conference dur-
ing the third week in Feb.
ruary.

garbage dump location on

town of Davidson as the ori-
ginal disposal propesal did.”

Aiken Lobbies
For Manor Use

By JAMES LEE
Staff Writer

“Direction of activities at
Lingle Manor after the disso-
lution of the manor group
next semester should be left
in the hands of the Union,”
B. A. Aiken said.

This claim brought the Col-
lege Union into the contro-
versy over the possession of
the Lingle Manor property.

Members of the manor
voted fast fall to let the
Student Council determine a
use for the facilities. The
council gave the opportunity
to the Freshmen Council
which initiated plans to de-
velop the property as a cen-
ter of activities primarily for
freshmen.

A breach in the proper pro-
cedure has been pointed out.
The proper procedure would
have been for the manor
group to submit a proposal to
the faculty through the facul-
ty committee, the College
Union, fraternities and clubs.

‘According to Aiken, both
the Freshmen Council and
the College Union have asked
that requests be submitted on
their behalf to determine the
future of the manor.

Aiken said that it would be
a mistake to turn the manor
over to any group on campus
which is basically unsuited
and financially unable to sup-
port activities.

He said, ‘“‘We are not try-
ing to compete with the fresh-
men, but we are concerned
with whether the Freshmen
Council is an appropriate pro-
gramming body to control the
manor.”

Proposals have been made

by Union staff members that
the property be set up in
some way to offer students a
place to meet and exchange
ideas on an informal basis,
and might be open all night.
Aiken stressed that he felt
the property should be de-
veloped for use by all mem-
bers of the student body.

Required
Chapels

Uncertain

The number of required
chapel and assembly pro-
grams for next fall remains
uncertain due to the curricu-
lum changes as outlined by
the Blue Sky Committee.

The Religious Policy Com-
mittee, which must meet to
consider Chaplain Scott
Woodmansee’s proposal that
there be fewer chapel periods
next year, has not yet met.
No meeting has been schedul-
ed.

If Woodmansee's proposal
ts accepted, it would provide
for two chapel periods each
week. One would be allotted
to religious speakers and out-
side speakers on major is-
sues, while the other period
would be set aside for student
organizations and speakers
contracted by those organiza-
tions.

Woodmansee said, ‘I can't
get any speakers for next
year until I am certain about
specific dates.’'

Magazine Polling To Select
Presidential Preferences

Davidson students will be
invited to participate in
CHOICE 68, a national col-
legiate presidential prefer-.
ence primary in April, spon-
sored by “Time” magazine.

The Student Council voted
Monday to organize the pri-
mary, which is being offered
to all colleges and universi-
ties in the country. “Time”
will underwrite the cost of the
national organization and ad-
ministration of CHOICE 68
and will furnish the ballots
for the vote.

The voter may indicate on
the ballot his age. political
party affiliation or preference
and three choices for Presi-
dent. The presidential candi-
dates will be grouped by
party, but the student will be
allowed to cross party lines
in his vote.
