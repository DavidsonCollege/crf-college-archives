FOR A BETIER. BASKET BALL QUINT)

CAT TRAX
As They Follow the Red and
Black
By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

The new term of sports starts off
with an unknown future, but with
fond hop All Wildcats are itch-
ing for a large dose of revenge to
be handed out to every opposing
team. The football season brought
very little consolation. There were
spots of brilliant play by the Cats,
but there seemed to be consider-
ably more lumination from other

‘sources, and as a result the old
Wildcat had his head rubbed pret-
ty deeply in the sod. There is
going to be plenty going on here
this spring, more ‘than ever before,
and the various squads will furnish
diversified entertainment for a
bunch of eager onlookers.

First thing we know Monk will be
sounding the call for spring grid work-
outs. Then the sweat will really begin
to pour, and before it is over there
will be plenty ,of weary bones and
skinned legs. This coming practice
season will excite more interest than
heretofore, because the question of
next year’s prospects is already abroad.
No doubt about the good material in
the frosh class. The problem is—can
the new men be whipped into a win-
ning combination? The backfield
should be well fortified, but that line
is needing all the support it can get.

When Captain Pritchett trots
onto the court Wednesday night
with his 1929 edition of the Wildcat
Basketball Five, the season will get
under way in earnest. Furman’s
Purple Hurricane is no mean oppo-
nent, in fact for the last two years
the Baptists have taken Monk’s
boys into tow without serious dif-
ficulty, We don’t know what the
Greenville lads are bringing to
town this time, but we venture to
say that they have a rough, tough
crew of basketeers, and it will take
all of Younger’s tricks to whip
them. Furman always plays a hard
game, but to make the situation
more serious, the local team has
engaged in no pre-season contest.
If they come through this first en-
counter in good style, then they
will be set to give plenty of trouble
later on.

We expect the team to grow better
with every game. Pritchett and Cal-
houn are the two: letter men on the
squad. The rest are green, though
Goodson and Rusk went well on the
frest’ quint last year, and Frontis
Johnston and Pat Crawford saw some
varsity service. The old saying about

hitching your wagon to a star may]
i

pull this year’s team through to a suc-
cessful season, for the schedule is one
of the most difficult yet tackled by a
Davidson team.

Carolina comes back on the
Wildcat list after an absence of
several year’s standing. The Tar
Heels don’t seem to be as good as
usual, and the Cats will give them
a stiff battle, with a mighty keen
chance of winning. Can’t tell what
might happen when the Cats get to
prowling around. That scrap in
Charlotte Saturday night will like-
ly draw about every Davidson man
who can bum, walk, or crawl down
there. Something about a David-
son-Carolina game that get’s you,
isn’t there?

Up here at Davidson we’ feel just
about as proud of Georgia Tech as
do the citizens of Atlanta. That WAS
a game! Sounded like one of the old
Frank Merriwell tales where the hero
grabs the oval in the last second of
play, dodges some thirty tacklers, and
falls across the goal line into the arms
of his sweet little girl, California nab-
bed most of the statistics except that
little matter of the score, and what a
whale of a difference a few points
make. Just like Camels! Tech had
the best team, though. With due re-
spect to the magnificent stand of the
Golden Bears, Tech’s all-around power
was the measure of supremacy. Hats
off to our National Champions from
Way Down South.

The student body has its chal-
lenge to help put the much‘longed-
for winning football bination
on the field next fall. This idea of
the band uniforms, if carried to
completion, will as¢ure Davidson
of a college band second to none
and excelled by few, as they say
at the circus. We've seen the —

Games—Big Squad Work-

Davidson's Wildcat basketeers will
play their second game of the season
at the Charlotte auditorium Saturday
night. Their opponent in the tilt will
be the Carolina quintet. Coach Monk
Younger will work today and tomor-
row correcting the mistakes which
came to the front in the Furman
game. last night.

The Carolina five, state champions
last year, have already played a num-
ber of games this season. They took
a trip through the midwest during the
Christmas holidays, playing Ohio State,
Butler, Louisville, and the University
of Kentucky. They lost their first
three games, but won from Kentucky.

Although Carolina has played a num-
ber of games already, the tilt Satur-
day will open the state schedule for
both teams. Carolina has lost many
of the stars from her last year’s cham-
pionship team but still has plenty of
powers The game should prove an in-
teresting affair for all concerned.

Coach Monk has been pushing his
boys and their play has been improv-
ing steadily. The game last night was
their first test under fire this season,
except a few practice scrimmages
with Coach Tilson’s freshman squad.

There are eighteen men on the squad
at present, two of which are letter
men. Most of the others were either
on the squad last year, or came up
from the freshmen team. Captain
Pritchett and Calhoun, both leter men,
are showing good form at the frward
positions, Shepherd also is playing
good basketball. The forward posi-
tions should cause Coach Monk very
little trouble.

At center, there are Wilson, Rusk,
and Johnson. Rusk and Johnson were
both stars on the interclass basketball
teams and Johnson was a squadman
from last year. Rusk was on the
freshman squad last year. Wilson has
been showing up well in practice.

At the guard positions Goodson,
Crawford, Moore, Proctor, and Baker
have.all been doing excellent work.
Crawford was on the squad last year
and was on the Senior Interclass bas-
ketball team. Goodson, Baker and
Moore also were on interclass teams.
These men should be able to hold the
guarding assignments well enough to
satisfy anyone.

Coach Monk has some god material
to work with, and if anything can be
judged from last night’s game he is
handling it in his usual capable manner,
The boys had the old Wildcat fight
and played the game in good style.

one movement that has been a long

here in earnest now, and it will be a
shame if the response is not whole-

cleared up before examination time.
Back the campaign up to the best of
your ability, and then rest assured of
a job well done. The athletic spirit
aroused here in coming years depends
largely on student support, and here
is your chance to shine in a real way.

Trip Through Virginia is Feature
of Fresh Card

The Davidson Wildkittens will have

a good one booked for last season, but
glance at the one listed below will
prove that it is a very difficult
schedule. There will be five encount-
ers at Davidson, and six on the road.

The trip up through Virginia will be
the main event of the season and will
take in most of the schools in the Old
Dominion State.

The card as announced by Freshman
Manager, John B. Moriarity, follows:

Jan, 14—Wingate College at David-

Jan. 290—Belmont Abbey at David-

The so-called “soundbeam” device in-
cluding a horn 20 feet long and ten feet
wide, with a multiplicity of reproducing
units, and operated by high-power vacuum
tubes, is expected by S. T. Williams, its
inventor, to be especially valuable

Most Comprehensive Schedule in
Years With Game at West
Point As High Spot

That Davidson’s football program
for this year is practically complete is
announced by Captain N. G, Pritchett,
graduate manager of athletics. The
season will open with a game against
Elon College at Richardson Field and
after a schedule of stiff encounters
will close with the game against Duke
University also at Richardson Field.

The schedule is very similar to that
of last year with the addition of the
game against the United States Mili-
tary Academy at West Point in place
of the Guilford clash of last fall.

In instances the place at
which the games are to be held has
not yet been decided. The managers
have considered several cities which are
anxious to procure games but have not
received many very acceptable ofters.
Whether the N. C. State game will be
in Raleigh or again in Greensboro has
been left for the State officials to
decite in consultation with the offi-
cials of the World War! Memorial
Stadium in Grensboro,

The game against the University of
North Carolina will again be played on
Richardson Field at the request of the
University authorities. Though the
Home Coming game has not yet been
officially chosen, in all probability,
as last season, the Carolina classic will
be played on home soil at a very con-
venient time.

The schedule
follows:

Chesterfield cigarettes are now sailing

of Chesterfield resulted from the individually expressed

preferences of a majority of the expedition’s members.

When it.is recalled that these are—in superlative sense
— picked men... selected not only for bravery, ability
and experience, but also by searching tests of physical

fitness... we may be forgiven for our considerable pride
in their vote. And something of this pride, we believe,
will be shared by all Chesterfield smokers.

It is another of the many proofs piling up that the
surest way to earn popularity is to deserve it!
