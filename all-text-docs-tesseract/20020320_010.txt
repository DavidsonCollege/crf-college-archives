Track team opens new season

By Jimmy SWANSBROUGH
Staff Writer

Stepping into the sunlit outdoors for the
first meet of the season on Friday afternoon,
the Davidson women’s track and field team
set its standards for the rest of the year. The
Wildcats competed in the Charlotte 49er Clas-
sic at UNC-Charlotte’s Irwin Belk track, and
posted several reputable marks over the course
of the weekend.

Sophomore distance Shenctn Laura Puckett
ran a strong 5000-meter race to place third
overall with a time of 18:45.27. Trailing
Puckett were sophomore Emily Einstein
(19:18.89) and senior Caroline Little
(20:19.23). The Friday night race was the
first of 2002 for Little, who dealt with injuries
during 2001.

In the middle-distance, freshman Anna
Brew led the way in the 1500-meter run with
a4:53.01. Finishing behind Brew was a Wild-

cat pack consisting of junior Liz Gross _

(5:13.12), and freshmen Lindley Swartz
(5:14.24), Sarah Baxter (5:15.70), and Genny
Hanisek (5:38.10).

The sprint groups performed commend-
ably as well. Junior Jenny DiCosmo finished
just over a second off the school record in the
100-meter dash with her time of 13.67.
DiCosmo also finished strong in the 200-
meter dash. Her 28.88 fell just short of fresh-
man teammate Clarissa Carr (28.40) but right
in front of sophomore Kate Wilson (29.33)

and junior Jana Yee (29.42).

Allin all, noted co-captain Gross, the first
outdoor meet ended well for the ’Cats. “It was
a great start to our outdoor season,” she said,
“and we can only hope to improve with each
race.”

Injury and loss in numbers have both
plagued the women’s team this year. Junior
Shaw Hipsher and sophomores Jenna Kruppa
and Elizabeth Trexler have all been out with
injuries during 2002, forcing coaches Jenni-
fer Straub and Adam Johnson to scramble for
a full roster. However, the current ’Cats will
tackle the season regardless of numbers, keep-
ing the conference championships within
reach on April 19.

The Wildcats’ next challenge will be at
home this weekend. Davidson will host the
Third Annual Irwin Belk Invitational, begin-
ning: Saturday at noon in Richardson Sta-
dium.

Wildcat men go the distance

By Liz' Gross

The men’s track and field team took
advantage of the weekend’s beautiful
weather as they opened the new outdoor
season with a solid performance at the
Charlotte 49er Classic.

With senior standout Dan Gibson unable
to run, the rest of the team stepped up and
delivered sound results in both the sprint-
ing and distance events.

The weekend’s top performance be-
longed to senior Jay Jahnes, who led the
men’s distance team with a 17th place in
the 2500-meter and a 23rd place in the
3000-meter. Jahnes crossed the 1500-meter
finish line in 4:02.85 and was closely fol-
lowed by sophomore teammate Greg Scott,
who placed 18th with a time of 4:03.23.

Davidson also had close finishes in the
5000-meter, in which Wildcats Chris
Schmader, Dave Bunge, and Brad Becken
all finished within two seconds of each other.
Schmader led the Wildcat pack with a time of
15:50.31, putting himself in 27th place.

Bunge and Becken followed with times
of 15:52.15 and15:52.87, respectively.

Last weekend was also junior Jimmy
Swansbrough’s return to action after miss-
ing the indoor season due to injury.
Swansbrough competed in both the 1500-
meter and 3000-meter, contributing strong
opening performances in both events.

- Freshman John Leverett stepped up this
past weekend as he led the men’s sprinting
team on the track in the shorter events.
Leverett ran an 11.22 in the 100-meter and
a 23.51 in the 200-meter, the top. Wildcat
finisher in, both events.

He was followed by junior co-captain
Greg Schernecke in the 100-meter with a
time of 11.28 and sophomore Drew Weber

‘in the 200-meter with a time of 24.21.

Andrew Pratt also.gave a strong perfor-
mance last weekend, as he was Davidson’s
top competitor in the 400-meter dash with
a time of 52.39.

Freshman Paul Wyatt was just behind
him with atime of 52.78. In the 800-meter,
Davidson’s top runner was sophomore
David Oyler, who finished the race with a
time of 2:03.16.

Drew Weber was Davidson’s fastest hur-
dler last weekend, as he finished the 110-
meter high hurdles in a time of 16.76 and
the 400-meter hurdles with a time of
1:00.05.

The Wildcats displayed their depth as
they posted two teams in the 4x400 relay.
Davidson’s first team finished in 3:29.17,
and the second team followed them in
3:35.34.

Davidson will look for a strong perfor-
mance before a large home crowd this
upcoming weekend, as they return to ac-
tion in the only home meet of the season,
the Irwin Belk Invitational.

Baseball skids into spring losing streak, falls to 0-6 in SoCon

By RICHARD CONNOLLY
Staff Writer

In accordance with that age-old saying,
March certainly did come in like a Lion for
the Davidson baseball team. With most of
the campus away on spring break, the Co-
lumbia University Lions stormed into town
on that first weekend in March and, fol-
lowing the cancellation of Saturday’s
games due to rain, downed the Wildcats
14-8 in the opener of the Sunday double-
header.

Senior co-captain Billy Ryan provided
the offensive spark for Davidson, knock-
ing in four RBI’s off three hits and scoring
two runs despite the loss.

Tim Frend (1-1) went the distance in the
Sunday afternoon match-up, yielding just
7 hits and striking out 6 while hitting his
third homerun of the season. Freshman
Michael Muniz unloaded his first career
round-tripper and junior DJ Dailey added
an RBI, but Frend was the real star as the
Maine native went 2-for-4 with 4 RBI’s in
leading Davidson to the 7-4 win.

Facing North Carolina A&T only two
days later, the Wildcats nearly wasted a
strong outing by junior Mark Wells (1-1),
who threw 5 solid innings, giving up just
four hits and an unearned run, while strik-
ing out six against four walks. Frend once
again led the offense, going 3-for-5, and
Ryan added two runs as the ’Cats held on
for the 7-6 win.

In the conference opener for both clubs,
The Citadel Bulldogs squeaked by the vis-
iting Wildcats 4-3. Davidson mustered only
three hits on the evening, and squandered
a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the eighth. Ryan
led all hitters with 2 RBI’s and Frend once
again proved himself worthy on the mound,
allowing just 2 earned runs off 5 hits.

The following day, Davidson tied the
ballgame with three runs in the seventh
only to watch the Bulldogs’ designated
hitter lace atwo-run single in the bottom of
the eighth for an 8-6 Citadel win. Frend
and Ryan each had 2 RBI's and Dailey
went 3-for-5 in the losing effort.

The Citadel completed the weekend
sweep the next day, cruising to a 5-3 vic-
tory as Davidson dropped to 0-3 in South-
ern Conference play and 7-9 overall. Wells
went 6 1/3 innings, giving up just 3 earned
runs, but a couple of costly errors allowed
the Bulldogs to plate two additional runs.
Offensively, Ryan led the charge going 3-
for-5 with one run, but The Citadel’s All-
American closer came on in the eighth to
shut the door on the Davidson nine.

Ending their five game road trip against
the University of South Carolina, the Wild-
cats were shutout 15-0 by the nationally
ranked Gamecocks. Five pitchers combined
to hold Davidson to just one hit, as #6
South Carolina improved its record to 16-
2 on the year. The Gamecocks recorded all
of their runs in the first three innings be-
fore the ’Cats bullpen could finally combat
the offensive barrage. Ryan reached on an
infield single and was walked, and a pitch
hit freshman Kenny Devenney as David-
son placed only 3 men on base all game.

Looking to end their four game losing
skid, the Diamond ’Cats returned to the
friendly confines of Wildcat Park for a
weekend home-stand with Georgia South-
ern, who has won the past two regular
season SoCon titles. The Eagles took both
games Saturday’s double-header by acom-
bined score of 22-7.

In game one, Georgia Southern scored
seven runs in the top of the second and
never looked back as they cruised to the
17-5 win. For the Wildcats, Benefield had
a pair of hits, including a two-run double,
and junior Matt Young jacked his first
collegiate homer in the ninth as a pinch-
hitter. Frend (1-2) suffered the loss after
giving up 12 runs, but only five earned, in
five innings.

The night cap produced a similar result
as three Eagles pitchers held the ‘Cats to
just 8 hits, striking out ten, and Georgia
Southern improved to a perfect 5-0 in
SoCon play with the 5-2 win. Wells threw
8 innings, giving up just three earned runs,
and Frend went for his fourth roundtripper
of year in the loss.

Davidson’s losing streak reached seven
games on St. Patrick’s day despite a four
run first inning when the Eagles, behind
eight solid innings from their starting
pitcher, held the ’Cats at bay for the re-
mainder of the game. Freshman Andy
Carter worked 7 and 1/3 innings on the hill,

allowing just four runs while striking out
six, but Georgia Southern’s designated
hitter crushed a two-run homer in the top
of the ninth as Davidson fell 8-6.

The Wildcats will host the Spartans of
UNC-Greensboro for a weekend home
stand.
