MUSICIANS, from page 4

that often deal with his own per-
sonal experiences and events.
Davidson composers not only
write about different subjects,
they also express themselves
through unique styles. Freshman
Less Lincoln has a reputation for a
particularly original musical style
that even he can’t find the words
to describe. “I don’t want to call it
jazz, synthesized or new age, so

what do you call it?”
Lincoln plays a_ synthesizer
with a multi-tumbler sound unit

and a keyboard attached to an —

IBM model 30. He composes
original music with the synthe-
sizer, even though he has never
taken piano lessons and only
completed his collection of tech-
nical equipment over Christmas,

Lincoln said he composed his
favorite song while “sitting
around” on Valentine’s . Day.
“Whenever there’s something

that hits me, everything else sim-
ply falls by the wayside. I must get
the emotion out.”

Sophomore John Morris said,
“I write whatever I think people
will like and and what will be
really bizarre.” Greatly influ-
enced by REM, Morris performs
his music with the band Rumpus,
which played for last year’s
Amnesty International concert,
FAC’s and several fraternity par-
ties.

Seniors Frank Whitaker and

Jay Barron, famous for their mel-
low musical styles, borrow tech-
niques from favorite composers
and add a country flavor. Both
Whitaker and Barron are inspired
by the music of James Taylor and
U2.

One of. Davidson’s newest
composers, freshman Croft
Stone, composed his first song
last spring. He wrote Full Circle
to share an experience that gave

’ shim “a very profound awareness

of the sanctity of life and exis-

RELL VELAB TIE OVARIES UV ICE TIA

tence.”

Stone’s. favorite song is Mr.
Free, which he composed for a
friend. aan

“Your hair’s blowing--in the
breeze, you’re Mr. Free ~

And when I look, all I see is who
I'd like to be eee :
Please take me with you, I can
ond i si

‘Please don’t leave me all alone in

this plastic land.”
