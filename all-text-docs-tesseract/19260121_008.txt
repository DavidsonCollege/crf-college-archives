liam Hendren, of Winston-Salem. will be
the speaker at the Y. M. C. A. service.

and is a well-known personage and a
very spirited, talented speaker. He car-
ries the distinction of being the president
of the North Carolina Bar Association,
an office of no small importance.

On the following Sunday, January 31,
Bishop Edward A. Penick of Charlotte
will speak. Bishop Penick is the Bishop
of the Diocese of North Carolina. He
will be remembered by many because of
his most enjoyable and forceful talk of
last year.

The first Sunday in February will bring
Mr, Stitt Wilson, who is a nationally-
known lecturer and speaker. Under the
supervision of the Southern division of
the Y. M. C. A. he is touring the south-
ern colleges and universities. He is a
thinker of the modern school and will
bring a message that will apply to the
young men, of today. Watch for Mr.
Wilson.

On February 14th, deputation from the
Louisville Theological Seminary will have
charge ofthe service.

Then Dr. D. H. Ogden, of a large Pres-
byterian Church in Mobile, Ala., will open

Juniors and Seniors to
Hold Preliminaries Soon

Many Men Show Interest in
Oratorial Contests

The date forthe preliminaries of the
senior oratorical contest as announced
by the Forensic Council will be February
oth. This date was selected so as not.to
conflict with eather the examinations or
the spring debating tryouts.

A large number of seniors are expected
to take part in these preliminaries. The
class of ’26 has many who have shown
marked ability along this line.

Among those who have signified their
intentions of entering are: H, L,. Shaw,
Jr, E. T. Pullen, A. Y, Bowie, R. B.
Parker, A. H. Hollingsworth, G. M. Ed-
dington, J. M. Garrison, J. E. Moore,
B. U. Ratchford. Others are expected to
enter before the tryout is held. With
this bunch of speakers and others, who
will enter, the competition should be
close, with many good orations given.

From this tryout four of the speakers
will be chosen to compete for the senior
Oratorial medal. The finals are held
during the week of commencement. This
contest should be a fitting climax of a
year of great forensic achievement.

In the preliminaries for the junior or-
atorial medal, held just before the Christ-
mas holidays, the following men were
selected to enter the finals; C. G. Davis,
D. H. Stewart, L. M. McCutchen, T. G.
McCutchen, C. W. Williams and W. C.
Ogden. These men are all prominent
men of their class and will compete for

‘Wonder Film Will

be Shown at Gym

“The Lost World,” perhaps the most |
sensational picture of the year will be
‘shown at the gymnasium Saturday night,
January 30th. This picture reverts back
to the prehistoric ages and gives in full
detail the loves and emotions of the cave
man. The most remarkable scene in the |
picture is the presentation of a fight be-
tween two dinosours. The price of film-
ing this one scene was enormous. The
images of the dinosours were made by a
New Jersey company and were operated
by electric motors twelve in number. The
deception is so perfect that it can hardly
be told fromthe real thing. Anyone who
misses this picture will pass up the op-
portunity of a lifetime of secing a real
presentation depicting prehistoric times.

Next Saturday night the “Midshipman”
will be shown, This picture was taken
within the walls ofthe Annapolis Acad-
emy and is a perfect picture of the life
there. Permission to film this produc-
tion was obtained fromthe government
only with the utmost difficulty. No one
should miss this opportunity to see the
life of the men in the United States Na-
val Academy, ‘

“Classmates” is a. similar production to |
“The Midshipman.” However this de-
picts the life at West Point in the Army
School. It is understood that this insti-
tution was somewhat jealous of the Naval
School and contrived in some manner to
have pictures taken of life within their
walls, This picture comes to the gym
on the night of Saturday, February 6th. |

“Sally Irene and Mary” will be shown
on the 13th of February. The picture is |
taken from the great stage success. Mary |
O’Brien is the star in the role of Mary.
This young lady was picked by Cecil De
Mille as the most outstanding young |
player of the year. The success of her |
‘pictures has carried out this conclusion.
There are few who can compare with |
her for beauty and her acting is perfect. |

On February 27th “Shamrock” will be |
shown. Little can be said about this |
‘picture at the present time. However it |
can be said with certainty that this pic- |
ture will not fall short of the other pic- |
tures which have been shown this year, |
and no one can protect against the ty
of pictures shown so far this fall.

FOR JUNIOR SPEAKING

(Continued from page 1)

considered expedient hy the members of the |
| special committee to have the various num- |
|bers on the program come as a surprise to}
the students. It has been stated, howeyer, |
that a number of special athletic feattires
have been scheduled along with performances |
of the Glee Club and Dramatic Club. It is
also understood that a special portion of the
program will be devoted to the Junior Ora-
toricals at the request of
Council.

The annual entertainment in the gym-
nasium will be one of the most unique and
amusing that has been presented in a num-
ber of years. Nothing of the nature of the
entertainment could be learned beyond the
fact that it will not be along the same type
as that of the past two seasons, and that it
will be a complete departure from the usual
minstrel and circus type.

Work has also been commenced on the
Junior Speaking magazine, which will retain
the name of “Sanity Rare.” All students,
regardless of class, have been urged to con-
tribute material for publication in the maga-
zine. Humorous stories, jokes, and illustra-
tions will be welcomed by the editor.

All fraternities will entertain during the
Junior Speaking holidays with house parties,
and all students will do well to invite a girl
up for the occasion. The festivities will
commence on April 8th and will continue
through the evening of April 12th.

Endeavorers Hold
Weekly Exercises

The Christian Endeavor Training class
held its regular meeting last Sunday at 1:30.
After opening with the customary song serv-
ice and prayer, President W. T. Covington
appointed various committees for carrying
on the work for February. Wm. E. Hill,
the leader for the meeting, talked of the
history of the Christian Endeavor Society.
Stating that the society was organized in
1881, at Portland, Maine, he followed the
story through the first convention in 1882,
and the election in 1888 of Dr. Clark as first
united Teader, up to the present time. Some
noteworthy facts presented were that the
Christian Endeavor has societies in all the |
large countries in the world, and that more
than 80 religions use the Christian Endeavor
Society. Jeff Garrison then gave a very in-
teresting account of the Young People’s Con-
vention held recently in Atlanta, and Hill
ended the program by outlining the class’
plans for February.

any one. Ben Ratchford, taking the part of
colonel, was the best actor in the play, and
together with his sonorous voice showed good
talent. The cast for the play was as fol-
lows:

Colonel Motley --.-----_---
Robert Lindsay ---
Roderick Stewart —
Will

Ben Ratchford
--- Wood Brown
-- Henry Powell |
--- Tyree Dillard
ze peter om ---- John McNeely
Mrs. Motley ~-------. Miss Johnsie Shelton
Mary Lindsay ----_- Mrs. F’. W. Hengeveld

Val Guthry was to have taken the part of
Roderick Stewart, but he became ill on the
afternoon before the performance. Henry
Powell took his part and did it admirably,
even though he had had so little time to
practice. i

The second play, “Tailor Made,” was by
far the best of the evening. Two lovers |
quarrel and separate. Fred Smith, taking the
part of Eb Pashly, contrives to bring them |
together again. Though the plot was far |
from being a deep one, the humor of the
situation made up for it. In fact the love |
affair was in the background compared to}
the dialogue between Smith and Deck, tak- |
ing the part of Captain Billy Harwood. They
frankly discussed the modern generation and
in a manner which kept the audience in an
uproar throughout the performance. The
cast of characters was as follows:

Bob Weston Frank Wilkinson |
ED pRash lyase wens ios Frederick Smith
Captain Billy Harwood Linton Deck
Dorothy Grayson Miss Ruth Erwin
Betty Park Miss Sarah Thompson

The final play was a creation intended to
show the battle between ignorance and |
science. An astronomer is, held in prison by
heathen worshippers of the sun god and is
condemned to die for profaning his powers.
He contrives to escape from the prison and
overthrows the image of the god, thereby
becoming “The Conqueror of the Gods.” |
The plot gave all promise of being the best |
of the evening and it is a pity that it should |
ave turned. out in such.an unsatisfying man- |
ner. Perhaps there was no other way to)
end it. It depicted wonderfully, however, |
the tendency of heathen worshippers to grab |

ingly fickle to those whom they worship. It
tather reverts the mind to Bible times.

comes to ingenuity. This rather rotund
member of the student body was defied by
“John Law” during the holidays because he
obstructed traffic in his home town. Said
sheriff while endeavoring to catch certain ,
law-breakers encountered Mr, Laws in a,
rather abrupt fashion and was materially
injured when he bounced off. Thereafter
Mr. Laws was barred from appearing on the
street.as a pedestrian. Only one solution of-
fered itself, that being to take the air via
the automotive route. H

Only one impediment offered itself in this
solution and that was the lack of pecuniary
evidence. Even as the younger Laws lack
said evidence so also did Papa Laws. Secret
conference was the order of the day and
when the sun came around again it beheld a
blazen sign on Papa Laws’ store announcing
the fact that said haberdashery was to give to
some lucky person a beautiful new Buick:car.
For each and every dollars’ worth of goods |
bought the patron would receive a chance |
on said engine of transporation. |

The other two people in this beautiful town
immediately: flocked to the store and bought
up all but fifty-five tickets. Thinking the
Laws family to be honest because of their |
name, they never turned their minds to the |
trickery of the situation, and both went)
happily home thinking the cart to be theirs in |
only a few days. However, the younger |
Laws forthwith went to the paternal place
of business and bought fifty-four dollars’ |
worth of goods, and Papa threw in the extra |
ticket. The two then put this ticket in a bag
and drew it out. The younger Laws was by |
far the winner,

Fearing for the safety of his being, how- |
ever, if perchance the other inhabitants of |
the town should lay their front feet upon}
him, he immediately withdrew to the. wilds |
In a few days a telegram was |
forthcoming announcing the younger Laws |
to be the winner of said car.

Now he in|
turn fears that Papa has confiscated said |
vehicle for his own use and will sell it back |
for the iron men that it would bring to the |
family coffers. Therefore Mr. Laws con-
templates a trip to the jungles of the Mis-|
sissippi levee to regain his pride.

When summer comes now Esquire Laws |
may ride leisurely through the town with!
some beautiful dame, give the arm of the}
law the high sign, and retiring to the eal
of the muddy Mississippi speak of love and|
times hereafter to his-heart’s content.
