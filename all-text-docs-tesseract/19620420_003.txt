The completion of Lake Norman next spring will)
offer an enodient opportunity for the expansion of the)
athletic department into water sports.

I don’t necessarily mean water sport competition on
an inter-collegiate basis, but even this wouldn’t be beyond |
the realm of possibility. Many Eastern schools like
Princeton and Dartmouth have Crew teams, and another
Southern Conference school, the University of West
Virginia, has a sailing team. However, for the more im-|
mediate future I was thinking more along the lines of
intermural athletics.

If the athletic department would be willing to pur-
chase a dozen or more sunfish or sailfish class sailboats,
these small craft could be used for racing in an interest-
ing and enjoyable addition to our intermural program.

Nor would the benefits be confined to competitive
sports. Pleasure sailing, canoeing, water skiing, and
others could be worked into programs under the super-
vision of the athletic department in such a way as to pass
off some of the compulsory P.E. requirements, Certainly
there will be an excellent opportunity for the broadening
of the athletic department into new areas.

PARKER TO REFEREE IN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS

Wrestling Coach Charlie Parker can look forward to
a busy summer: Soon after school lets out, Parker will be
heading for New York to referee in the National A.A.U.
Wrestling Tournament. The tournament will be held at
the New York Athletic Club during the first week in
June. The results of this tournament will be used to
determine who will represent the United States in the
World Championships, which will be held later in June
at Toledo, Ohio.

Parker will also serve as a referee at this tourna-
ment, which will be conducted under Olympic style
wrestling rules rather than collegiate rules. This will
mark the first time that the World Championships have
ever been held in this country, and we will act as host
to some forty nations who will be sending teams.

SHORTENED GAMES IN ACC AN IMPROVEMENT

The current attempt in the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence to speed up baseball games seems to be meeting with
success. According to Wilton Garrison in Wednesday’s
Charlotte Observer, coaches report that they are cutting
down on game time by twenty to thirty minutes. The
coaches plan to recommend that similar rules be adopted
for all college baseball. If adopted these rules would make
baseball a more interesting sport to watch and would
perhaps improve attendance at our games, which cer-
tainly wouldn’t hurt anything.

MORE NEWS ON ‘LEFTY’

Coach ‘Lefty’ Driesell is having another hot prospect
down this weekend. He is Chris Kinum, a 6’4” forward
from East Orange, N. J., who was first team All-State.
Lefty calls Chris “‘one of the best ball players in the coun-
try.” Recently, Driesell was guest speaker at the annual
Winston Salem News-Sentinel banquet for the All-North-
western All-Star basketballers. He is the first coach out-

Davidson's baseball team hosts George Washington tomorrow here in a new role—

both ends of a double header to Furman.

Spring Practice Closes
With Tomorrow's Game

The Wildcat gridders wind up
spring practice tomorrow, cap-
ping the thirty-day, twenty-ses-
sion season with a four-quarter
intersquad match.

Though off to a hesitant start
due to rain, the spring sessions
appear to have been a success.

Spring training is designed
primarily to give the coaches a
preview of the coming fall and
to give the players a chance to
work out kinks. Drills stress
mainly basic fundamentals,

grooming upcoming sophomores.
Likewise, much of the scrim-
mage time is devoted to polish-

ing plays, fitting in new replace-
ments and greasing up the old.

Most of the positions for next
fall's forces have been filled
more than adequately. The ends
have been bolstered somewhat;
there is good depth and added
potential in the middle of the
line, especially at center; and
the halfback slots are overflow-
ing with talent. The ‘Cats, per-
haps, have adequately compen-
sated for the loss of an out-
standing senior class.

All in all, Spring Practice may
well be the portent of an even
better fall; tomorrow's game
will give some indication.

Netters On Wednesday

When the Davidson tennis
team acts as host to the Bulldogs
from The Citadel, the Wildcats
will probably. find really tough
going, as Fogleman rates the
Bulldogs “one of the best in the
Southern Conference.” The Cita-
del recently took a second place
in the South Carolina inter-col-
legiate tennis tournament.

Playing on home courts Wed-
nesday, the Cats dropped a 6-3
conference decision to Furman,
a team that was beaten earlier
in the season by The Citadel.

Fogleman was not too pleased
with the match with Furman,
saying, “the team lnoked better
against Duke and Carolina than
against Furman.” -

Last Friday the netters _ lost
to Duke, 8-1, with junior Bobby
Austell, playing the number one
position, as the only one able
to halt the Devil tide.

Cordle Takes wow

For 13 Point Showing

This week Junior Bob Cordle has achieved the rather
unusual distinction of receiving recognition as the ‘“Wild-
cat of the Week” for the second time.

Cordle is usually thought. of
as a pint-sized halfback for
Coach Dole’s gridders. It was in
that role that he received the
WOW award last year, when —
in his -first varsity game—he
led the Wildcats to a 1846 vic-
tory over Catawba. This spring,
however, with the permission of
Coach Dole, Cordle is sitting
out spring football practice .in
order to render his services to
Coach Whittle’s track team.

Cordle, a Charlotte native,
has been a consistant winner
thus far this spring in the 100
and 220 yd. dashes. In between
dashes he manages to place high
in the -broad jump competition.

The most recent outstanding
performance of the. speedster

| was in the dual meet with Pres
| byterian College last Tuesday. In

that meet Cordle overcame some
competitors for victories
in the 100 and the 220.

In addition, he placed second
teammate John Chiles in
jump, bringing his
point total for the day to 13 to
lead the ‘Cats to a resounding,

Thinclads Battle G-W;
Tough VPI Future Foe

The Davidson College Cindermen travel today to meet with the University ot
Richmond in a conference dual meet at Richmond. Next Tuesday the

Wildcats

journey again to Virginia to meet VPI, who is termed “very strong” by Coach Heath
Whittle.

440 and the 880 relay: the Davidson mentor

On Wednesday, the Wildcats,
led by Bob Cordle with 13
points and Andy Boggs with 11
points, romped over Presbyter-
ian College 89'2 - 41%. Boggs
took firsts in the discuss and in
the javelin while Cordle took
firsts in the 100 and 220 yard
dashes.

Whittle was well pleased with
this win, one of the team’s
strongest showings of the year
“This year's team has some very
outstanding individual perform-
ers that compare with David-
son's previous best,” said Whit
tle, “however this year’s team
lacks depth, especially in the
880 and 2 mile run. It is good
to have firsts, but a team needs
seconds and thirds to win.”

On April 14, Coach: Whittle
carried a small group of David

at Furman. Cordle, along with
