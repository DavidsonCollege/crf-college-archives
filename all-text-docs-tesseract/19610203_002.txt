THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 3. 1961

(All Unstqned Editorials oy the Editor)

John Evans For Dean

In 1958 THE DAVIDSONIAN sup-
ported a man named Grier Martin for
the presidency of Davidson College.
We are not quite so cocky as to pre-
sume that Grier Martin was selected
for the job because of this news-
paper’s backing—but we do _ think
that perhaps THE DAVIDSONIAN’S
support was a fair indication of stu-
dent feeling.

We now throw another hat into
another ring.

We urgently request that Dr. John
B. Evans be closely considered for
the position of Dean of Students.

We make this request without hav-
ing communicated with Dr. Evans—
we have no way of telling whether or

not he would accept the job if it were -

offered to him, But we think it's
worth ‘a try.

Evans. is presently pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church in Auburn,
Alabama. He taught Bible here from

1957 until last spring when he re-
signed to accept the Auburn pastor-

ate. He also coached the freshman.

wrestling team and helped Coach
Charlie Parker with the varsity. Stu-

A Good Choice

It is evident that President Martin
made a good choice when he appoint-
ed John Kuykendall the first fratern-
ity liaison officer.

Since his appointment in early
January, Kuykendall has been respon-
sible for insuring that all fraternity

members comply with the College's
fraternity regulations. He has also
been responsible for keeping the Fac-
ulty abreast of fraternity activities
and briefing fraternity presidents on
Faculty attitudes on fraternity af-
fairs.

To say the least, Kuykendall has a
difficult assignment.

Since January Faculty-fraternity re-
lations have been much improved:
credit should gp to John Kuykendall
and a group of fraternity presidents
who have been willing to face the
necessity of compromising with the
College.

For the first time in Davidson's
history. the “hell has been almost
completely removed from. Greek
Week. This would not have been pos-
sible without a better understanding
between the Faculty and fraternity

dents and athletes who were in con-
tact with him knew him as a fine
teacher and a good friend. ,

John Evans, more than any man
we can think of, is generously quali-
fied to be a dean of students. He is
a graduate of Davidson College and
is aware of the problems that stu-
dents here face.

He is a man who is acquainted with
Davidson's traditions, taboos, and phi-
losophies—and yet he is one who has
the foresight and courage to break a
tradition that is a stagnation or to
debunk a philosophy that has become
a dogma.

He is young. He has been away from
the school as a student for only ten
years. and as a teacher only a year.
But he has the maturity that makes
youth a tremendous asset rather. than
a liability.

John Evans is not a pastor who
would relish leaving a church to
which he has given himself for only
a year. But the need here is a great
one. Perhaps he could be persuaded.

It is well worth a try.

members.

Kuykendall has spent many hours
working with the fraternity presi-
dents on Greek Week. He has. ap-
proved fraternity activities which are
in keeping with the Greek Week regu-
lations and has made_ necessary
changes in proposed Greek Week
schedules to prevent violations. He
will enforce the regulations, a job
which the IFC in past years has failed
to do.

Few people. expected Kuykendall to
accomplish so much so quickly.

Kuykendall sees his office as more
than just a Greek Week policeman.
He has said that he hopes to be able
to improve the accuracy of fraternity
bookkeeping and encourage fratern-
ity. advisors to become more actively
interested in their jobs.

To John Kuykendall go our con-
gratulations; he has shown the faculty
that the fraternities, with encourage-
ment, can live up to their ideals. He
has shown the fraternities that they
have a definite responsibility to Dav-
idson College.

An Excellent Beginning

It is too early yet to make any in-
telligent appraisal—or any predic-
tions—concerning the administration
of John F. Kennedy: his term is not
yet two weeks old.

But one thing is clear, even to his
detractors: he has made an excellent
Start.

His inaugural address—a brilliant
expression of his hopes for ‘America
~—has won praise from all quarters
as a really great speech.

His early official acts—increasing
surplus food quotas to depressed areas
and revoking the controversial Eisen-
hower directive recalling overseas
servicemen’s dependents—have been
effective. balm on sore spots, and
have seen a real boost in- morale to
many.

The new President has displayed
an eagerness to exert the power and
influence of the presidency through
maximum use of the executive order
—something his predecessor seldom
did.

His state of the Union message,
whether or not the picture he painted
was “too black”—showed an admir-

part to tell Americans hard facts as
he sees them.

In Kennedy’s press conferences and
public appearances he presents an
image of coolness and confidence
which is undeniably impressive.

So far, for Kennedy, so good.

Perhaps the new national mood. of
optimism and widespread approval
are common things for a new adminis-
tration; we remember the country’s
joy when Eisenhower rode into Wash-
ington on his promise to “throw the
rascals out.”

Perhaps, for many. disillusionment
is not far off; many citizens remember
the Eisenhower years—which began
in hope—as years of sluggishness and
disenchantment born of such fiascoes
as the Goldfine episode and the U-2
incident.

But we hope, and we're inclined to
believe—that this will not be the case.

John Kennedy is tough, talented
and dedicated. He has surrounded
himself with men recognized for in-
tellect as well as business acumen.

And he has shown in a short time
at when he says, “vigah’—he means
t.

able willingness on the President’s E. S. D.

Professor Polley: The Author Distorts
History In Order To “Prove” His Case

By DR. MAX POLLEY

(Editor’s note: Or. Polley
is an Associate Professor of
Bible and is faculty advisor
to the Book-of-the-Year Pro-
gram. This year’s Book-of-
the Year is Exodus by Leon

Uris. The author will be on
campus February 22-23.

Exedus is a controversial
book. Its appeal rests not
upon its literary merits, for
it is not well written, but
upon the sympathy it creates
for the “homeless” Jew.
Coupled with the trial of
Adolf Eichmann our atten-
tion is focused. upon one of
humanity's greatest crimes—
the extermination of six mil-
lion European Jews.

With forthrightness the
author portrays the centuries
of torture, humiliation, and
indignity that have been
forced upon the Jews. Hav-
ing known a Rabbi in Michi-

gan whose parents were
made into soap by Nazi Ger-
mans, I read these pages with
deep concern.
DISTORTIONS

But it also disturbs me
that the author distorts his-
tory in order to “prove” his
case! He intends to make you
anti-Arab and anti-British
and will stop at nothing to
assure his success. The fol-
lowing instances of such dis-
tortion are taken from “The
Exodus: A Distortion of the
Truth” available in the Pa-
per Back Store for 25c.

1. The Arabs are pictured
as dirty. backward, dishon-
orable, and cowardly while
the Israelis are above re-
proach.

2. Every raid of a freedom
fighter on an Arab village
is for “retaliation,” even
when they machine gun de-
fenseless people.

PARTITION
3. In connection with the

U. N. vote for partition
the Arabs “forced” the
Greeks upon their side

while the Jews appealed to
each nation’s sense of mor-
ality. (James Forrestal, form-
er U. S. Secretary of De-
fense, in reference to this
vote for partition, writes:
“The methods that had been
used to bring coercion and
duress on other nations in
the General Assembly bor-
dered closely on to scan-
dal.”)

4. Mr. Uris would also
have you believe that the
Zionists purchased the land
Jegally from the Arabs and
reclaimed it from the desert.
Actually, by the time of par-
tition they had purchased
only about 7 per cent of the
land; the rest was acquired
by forceful occupation and

Conservatives, Liberals
Face Approaching Battle

Much attention is being devoted these days by columnists and journalists to the
battle between conservatives and liberals which may erupt during the present ses-
sion of Congress and to the conflict that is beginning to take shape within the
Republican Party between Senator Barry Goldwater and Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
Moreover, Goldwater, among others, is taking every opportunity to point out
what he sees as a growth in conservative strength which will soon reverse the lib-
eral trend that has dominated the country since the days of Roosevelt.

With these facts in mind,
an examination of the oppos-
ing philosophies becomes es-
sential for the public-minded
citizen. For a proper under-
standing of these two posi-
tions, one must note two
“revolutions” which are hav-
ing profound effect through-
out the world today.

REVOLUTION

The first of these “revolu-
tions” is the tendency toward
collectivization. Collectiviza-
tion sounds like a purely
Communistic concept, but it
is a phenomenon which is
sweeping the world, includ-
ing, to a considerable degree,
the United States.

The individual is losing
his importance as an indivi-
dual.. Nowadays, everyone
clamors to join the Rotary
Club,' the Elks, fraternities
—in short, groups. Many for.
ces have joined to add to the
ascendence of the Group, in-
dustrialization and urbaniza-
tion being two.

Even in the area of busi-
ness we find wide-spread
collectivization. We speak of
Sig Business, which is busi-
ness that has been collecti-
vized to a great degree.

Collectivization is also evi-
dent in government as is
demonstrated by the continu-
ing debate over centraliza-
tion of power in the hands
of the federal government,
and by the growing number

of governmental welfare

agencies.

The philosophy is, ‘‘As in-
dividuals we are small and
insignificant, but as groups
we demand and deserve at-
tention.” To cure its faults,
mankind is turning from the
individual and is. resorting
to the collective Group.

TECHNOLOGY

The second revolution,
which can can be stated sim-
ply, comes as a result of the
technological revolution and
its promise for the world
economy. It is now possible
for man to envision a world
without want. For the first
time in history, man can lick
the problems of hunger and
poverty. The promise of mod-
ern economics has caught
the fancy of man from Gha-
na to Havana.

Liberalism is right up to
date, taking the principles
of both of these revolutions
as its creed. Centralization
of power in the hands of the
federal government is view-
ed as a natural companion to
the increased collectivism
within our society. Big Busi-
ness, Big Church, and Big

Army necessitate Big Gov-
ernment.
FREEDOM

Conservativism, on the
other hand, places its pri-
mary emphasis on individual
freedom. It holds that even
in the face of the two “revo-
lutions,” individual rights
are not outdated. Rather, the
duty of protecting individual
rights is simply multiplied.

In its program to protect
individual rights, conserva-
tives cast a wary look at any
legislation which places
more power into the hands
of the government. Conser-
vatives operate on the prin-
ciple that Big Government
tends to restrict individual
freedom, and, in this day of
Big Government, we must
protect our rights with in-
creased vigor.

The resulting debate is
often bitter. In the face of
the conservative principles.
the liberal often cries, “What
rights are you protecting,
the right to starve?” The
conservative replies, “what
good is a full stomach when
your individual rights are
denied?”

terrorism.
SHIP SINKING

5. The author attacks the
British for allowing the
Patria to sink off Palestine’s
shores drowning hundreds
of refugees. He fails to men-
tion that the Zionists sank
the ship themselves to cre-
ate public sympathy for the
cause.

6. Only the first clause of
the Balfour Declaration (that
promises a national home to
the Jewish people) is quoted,
while the sections guaran-
teeing the rights of the
Arabs in Palestine and anti-
Zionist Jews throughout the
world were omitted.

Above all, however, it is
on behalf of my Jewish
friends that 1 find this book
most disturbing. For it eu-
Jogies the creation of a Jew-
ish state and places in jeop-
ardy their position as Ameri-

can Jews. Israeli is present-

ed as the home of Jews and

the call is for all to return.
BEN-GURION

In 1948 at the 25th Zionist
Congress in Jerusalem Ben-
Gurion said: “Every religi-
ous Jew has daily violated
the precept of Judaism by
remaining in exile.” With-
out thinking, I fear, the U.
S. Jew has poured $500 mil-
lion into Israel in the last —
twelve years. If they would
reflect upon their heritage
they would realize that Juda-
ism will fulfill her highest
calling as a religion and not
as a nation.

I urge the reader to ap-
proach Exodus critically.
There are at least two sides
to this issue. For a presenta-
tion of the Arab cause con-

FOCUS

They Know Too Little--
Writer Says Of Trustees

By ERVIN DUGGAN

The Trustees are coming.

Soon they will arrive for another day-long meet-
ing, and most likely a familiar pattern will be re-

peated:

They will hear and approve a basketful of prog-
ress reports, financial statements and other announce-

ments. ~

They will nod collective assent upon hearing a
number of suggestions from faculty and administra-

tion.

They will rofl pious eyes heavenward at the men-
tion of student drinking ... the current “problem”...
but most will avert their eyes when the more serious
moral problem of their own no-Negro admissions

policy is broached.
Then they will leave.

We'll scarcely know they’ve been here, except for

a notice in the next day’s Charlotte Observer: an ac-
count of the proceedings, replete with quotes and an-
nouncements of new gifts or new progress.

Chances are, most of them will leave knowing
little more about Davidson than when they arrived.
And such knowledge, for too many, is precious

little knowledge.

The trustees, as even a.casual conversation with

some will reveal, are not well-informed.

To begin with, unlike Harvard’s Board of Over-
seers and a half dozen other Ivy League Boards,
Davidson’‘s trustees are generally not distinguished
by intellectual achievements but by worldly success.

They are big businessmen, big doctors, big lawyers,

big preachers.

Some, quite plainly, have no particular qualifica-
tions for educational policy-making.

In addition, the Board is too large (over fifty mem-
bers) and meets too infrequently (three times a year)
to be as effective as possible.

Suppose we quizzed the trustees:

How many could offer a sensible and original

opinion on the role of Christian higher education in
America without floundering—or lamely resorting

to quoting “experts”?

How many “conservative” trustees could defend
segregation at Davidson with some really well-consid-
ered argument... and not the old, irrelevant red flag.

of “intermarriage’’?

How many have given real thought to the anach-
ronisms of Davidson policy: the faculty’s religious
ivonclad oath, for instance?

How many really know what’s being taught here?

How many are really, really familiar with Davidson.

College . . . and not just with administration reports,
the alumni journal and the newspaper?

One Florida trustee used to write to a student
friend: “Would like .to see you when I’m there for
Trustees’ meeting. Suppose we meet in front of the

Chamberlain Building. . .

And recently a college official termed “appalling”
the ignorance of trustees in fraternity-house bull ses-
sions two years ago. Some, he said, didn’t even know
Davidson students attend chapel three times a week!

Since then, an effort has been made to sharpen
trustee awareness a little bit.

But more should be done:

A faculty-student liaison committee could prepare
reading lists on pertinent educational subjects for the
trustees, and issue a monthly newsletter to trustees on

issues of importance.

The college could urge that every trustee pay a
campus visit each year of about three days’ length
during which time he would live in a dormitory, in-
terview students and professors, eat at fraternity
houses and attend classes daily.

Trustee-student-faculty conferences and debates

should be scheduled . . . as often as possible.

And trustees should never leave the campus with-
out having long, informal, unrehearsed, wide-open,
no-holds-barred conversations with students and fac-

uity ... on the really im
nocuous topics assigned

office.

portant issues, not on in-
y

the public relations

Davidson’s trustees are forming policy for this
institution as it moves into an era of national crisis in

higher education.

They should not be ignorant . . . not even a little

bit ignorant.
