Maverick at the Outpost

Card sharks Buck, Young, Cromartie and Ruggiero take home some dough

By Susan RUGGIERO
Arts and Living Editor

“Was that fast? I thought that
was fast. Was that fast?”

It was not Mel Gibson’s guns
that students thought were fast at
the Outpost Friday night, but the
time allotted foreach Spades match
in a tournament sponsored by the
Union Board.

In an effort to keep the tourna-
ment from becoming a true “Mav-
erick” event — lasting all night —
the coordinators of the event lim-
ited each round to half an hour.

When half the contestants
were eliminated after only 30 min-
utes, the large crowd in the Out-
post quickly dissipated as many

students walked away in disgust.

Some tables were only able to
play two hands of cards, which
became deadly for any team that
overbid.

The time limit was not the
only aspect of the game with which
students were dissatisfied. Before
the event began, grumblings could
be heard all over the room as stu-
dents complained about the offi-
cial rules for the game, which in-
cluded Big Joker, Little Joker and
no nil or blind bidding. Many
tables decided to play a more tradi-
tional version of the game and set
ground rules themselves before
starting play.

Thirty teams of two entered
the 10 p.m. tournament and paid a

Movie Review

Clueless
about Emma

By SHAUNA GRIFFIN
Staff Writer

‘The other night, a few friends
and I went out to The Manor, a
movie house in Charlotte, to see
Emma, a new screen version of
Jane Austen’s classic novel by the
same name. Or, if you prefer, we
saw an adaptation of the movie
Clueless. The similarities between
these two films were quite strik-
ing, even down to some of the
mannerisms of the main charac-
ters, and some of the names of the
lesser ones.

Unfortunately, these little
similarities meant that I spent much
of the movie trying to figure out
which Emma character corre-
sponded with which Clueless char-
acter, comparing acting skills and
dress styles, and in general forget-
ting to enjoy the movie for itself.

I did notice (and was duly
impressed by) the ease with which
the main character was able to
maintain her composed manner of
speaking, even in moments of ten-
sion (why isn’t real life like that?).

It was the small details, such as the
manner of speaking, beautiful
weather, and huge wardrobes that
made the movie a great escape
from reality, which is, I suppose,
the reason most movies are made.

On to the little details that can
make or break a movie: The set
designs were absolutely beautiful
—romantic when appropriate, se-
rious when needed. Those scenes
set outside were especially well
chosen and laid out. The scenes
inside were authentic, but often
seemed a little awkward, at least
when there were two or three char-
acters seated in armchairs (how
often do you and your friends sit
knee to knee?).

The costumes were well de-
signed for the most part, although
the men looked uncomfortable and
stuffy, and Harriet Smith too
frumpy.

Emma_ was also surprisingly
funny, and with Gwyneth Paltrow
in the lead, was admirable acted.

In all, I enjoyed the movie,
and would recommend it as a good
way to spend a few hours.

$3 entrance fee in hopes of win-
ning the fifty dollars for first place
cash prize. Dennis Rice, manager
of the Outpost, even got into the
spirit of the game by offering free
pizzas to the top two teams.
Several pairs of players came
prepared to play, going as far as
dressing alike. One team wore
white shirts and jeans with back-
wards baseball caps to emphasize
their card shark abilities. Fresh-
men Cam Houser and Howie
Cockrill arrived ready to play cards
in $1.25 smoking jackets from
Goodwill, and brought, in vain,
victory cigars. They made it tothe
quarter finals, where they agreed
with their opponents, Jeffery
Cromartie and Susan Ruggiero, to

extend playing time to an hour,
making it, as Cromartie said, “the
first real game of the night.”

By the time Cromartie and
Ruggiero faced Dennis Buck and
Scott Young in the championship
round, both teams decided to elimi-
nate luck from playing any factor at
all in the match. After carefully
calculating the potential winnings
— $50 to first place and $20 to the
runners-up, plus the pizza — as
well as other factors, which
Cromartie described to his oppo-
nents as “it’s late, it’s Davidson,
you’re a senior and you’re not go-
ing to be here forever,” the players
diplomatically agreed to declare
both teams the champions and split
the prize money.
