| Davidson's United Carolina
Bank To Expand Building

By Ross Sloop

The United Carolina Bank at
the corner of Main and Depot
streets will be destroyed within the
coming weeks. The bank is mak-
ing way for a new complex that
will be built on the site of the
current building.

Branch management assures
that the rebuilding project will be
of no hinderance to Davidson stu-
dents and faculty who bank there.

This Friday, employees will
move equipmentand otherbelong-
ings outof the bank into a trailer lo-
cated directly behind their build-
ing. U.C.B. will then operate out
of this trailer until the new com-
plex is complete.

Branch manager Catherine
Small expects construction to take
less than a year.

“Hopefully we will have
moved into our new complex by
Christmas.”

Although United Carolina
Bank has occupied the red brick
building on the corner of Main and
Depot since they moved to
Davidson in 1984, Small reports

that the bank never intended for
that building to be its permanent
home.

“We’re upgrading our location
for two reasons. We not only need
more space, but we would like to
provide our customers with the
best facilities,” says Small.

The new complex will include
an automatic teller machine and
safety deposit boxes for bankers.

The building will accomadate
more than just the bank, however.

“Students know this because it
