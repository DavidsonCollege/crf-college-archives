DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS

Women's Soccer Shoots
for Southeast Top 10

By Will Siler

Second-year coach Kevin
Hundley expects this year’s
women’s soccer team, only the
fourth in Davidson history, tochal-
lenge many of the best teams in the
Southeast region and the country.
With nine starters returning from
last year’s squad and a wealth of
talented freshmen expected to con-

tribute immediately, the Wildcats "

appear capable of doing just that.

‘Among the starters back from
last year’s 10-7-1 tcam are
standouts Jennifer Satterficld in
the back and three-year starter Ann

Todd atcenter halfback. The Wild--

cats also retum both goalkeepers
and all but one goal-scorer from
last year’s team, including sopho-
more Ellen Sprinkle, who scored
12 goals in her freshman scason.

Duc to the number of talented
freshmen, five or six of whom will

see significant time from the be-
ginning of the scason, Hundley
‘will have the luxury of substituting

frequently this year, something he
has not been able to do in the past
because of a lack of depth.. Al-

though the team is made up of |

cight freshmen, scven sophomores,
and only five juniors and three
seniors, Hundley doesn’t expect
his team to play as if inexperi-

’ enced, ‘Many of Davidson’s under-

classmen have been starters since
their freshman ycars and have sig-
nificantexpericnce. Hundleyis also
excited by the increascd level of
play his team has shown in the
prescason. “Each year,” he said,
“the talent level has gotten better,
[and] every ycar [there] has been
an improvement in the level of

play.”

Thisscason’s schedule reflects
thatimprovement. The 1992 sched-
ule includes games with five

schools ranked in the top ten in the
Southeast, Duke, Vanderbilt,

UNC-Greensboro, Mercer and na-

Under pressure from the Guilford defense, Davidson Quarterback Richard Howell passes for a completion.

Cats Overcome Quakers,
Weather in 18-3 Win

By Chris Hood

Davidson’s new run-and-
shoot offense provided the most
production in over a decade of
season openers, and the defense
allowed its lowest point total in
two years as the ‘Cats topped
Guilford 18-3 at Richardson Field
Saturday. The loss avenged a 21-3
defeat to the Quakers in the teams’
season opener a year ago.

» Despite the inspired play of
the home team, Saturday’s winner
nearly proved to be the weather. A
steady rain developed in the sec-
ond quarter, and thunderstorms
caused an hour-and-a-quarter de-
lay at halftime.

“This was one of the great

jobs of playing and coaching I’ ve

seen here at Davidson,” a jubilant
head coach Dave Fagg said. “We
had a tremendous family team ef-
fort today.”

Davidson opened the scoring
on its first possession of the after-
noon when Mike Wright broke
through the Quaker line for a five-

yard touchdownrun. From the start,
it was obvious that the new offen-
sive formation had a great deal of
potential. With quarterback Rich-
ard Howell calling the plays and
audibles at the line of scrimmage,
the ‘Cats mixed up passing and
running plays to keep the defense
off balance.

The squads exchanged pos-
sessions before Guilford began to
move the football and moved into
Davidson territory.’A pair of hold-
ing penalties and a stiff defense
drove the Quakers back, however,
and the first quarter ended with the
‘Cats ahead 6-0.

Guilford’s lone score came on
its first possession of the second
quarter. After opening the drive on
their own 45, they moved 46 yards
in seven plays before stalling on
the Davidson nine. Chris Chavis,
one of four Guilford quarterbacks
Saturday, replaced starter Brindon
Christman and found widereceiver
Phil Lemons twice for 41 yards to
setup Ty Clodfelter’s 26-yard field

Organized Chaos:
A Guide to Rugby

By Dack Stackhouse
Ahhhhhhhh! What’s going

on? I am running down a large,

field, and 15 gargantuan people
are chasing me all over the place.
Even worse, there are 14 other
people who I thought were my
friends, but all they do is follow
behind me. Couldn’t they at least
divert a couple of these monsters
that are chasing me? I guess not. I
hear the heavy footsteps of one
giantapproaching me from therear,
as well as the screams from my
enemies vividly describing how
they intend to dismember me and
consume me for dinner. Suddenly,

I am dragged to the ground. I re-
lease the ball which I have been
carrying, and the barbarians leave
me alone.

This scene is nota nightmare. It
is rugby. Although some may be-
lieve thatrugby is a nightmare, it is
not. To the novice viewer, the game
can appear to be total chaos. How-
ever, rugby. is not all that compli-
cated. The game originated from
soccer and preceded American
football. Thus, it combines the ex-
citement and continuous action of
soccer and the roughness of foot-

goal to move the latin to within
three points.

The Quakers would come no
closer, as the ‘Cats promptly
marched 77 yards en route to their
second touchdown of the contest.
A critical 26-yard third down
completion from Howell to tight
end Matt Matheny Ied to a 17-yard
touchdown strike to wide receiver
John Bodkin. The ‘Cats failed on
theirtwo-pointconversion attempt,
but the primary damage had been
done.

__ Those who waitedout the half-
time thunderstorm were treated to
the best of the Davidson's special
teams to open the second half. Af-
ter the squad returned to the field
turning somersaults, Fassett drove
an onsides kick straight into the
arms of a sprinting Alden Smith.
Facing a-fourth down from the
Quakers’ 31, Fassett droppedapunt
inside the visitors’ one-yard line. .
