Women fall by six to Gardner-Webb i in home swim meet

By ASHLEIGH FINN
Staff Writer

On Friday night, the Wildcats hosted their
first meet of the year in a competitive and gru-
eling competition against Gardner-Webb and
Catawba. The ’Cats lost by only six points,
falling 118.5 to 112.5 to Gardner-Webb. De-
spite the tough loss, the Wildcats gave an im-
pressive performance.

Megan Perez ’05 helped start off the meet
by taking the lead in the 100 fly. Her first-
place finish in 1:00.08 was also a season-best.
Lauren Taft ’05 followed right behind Perez,
placing second in the 100 fly with a solid time
of 1:00.59.

Co-captain Jenny Hoekstra ’05 also stepped
up for the senior class and took first in the 50
free with a season-best of :25.40.

Megan Hollar ’06, a returning junior from
abroad, stepped up the competition immedi-
ately in the 100 breast. In her first meet since
last spring, Hollar pulled out a time of 1:08.13,
a team-best of the year.

Freshman Kirsten Allen ’08 also gave a
strong performance; she flew through the 100
free with a time of :55.05.

Divers Judy Otvos ’05 and Christie Brough
’06 showed strength and skill on the boards
and scored high points for the ’Cats.

Despite the fact that the meet was solely a
women’s competition, the men’s team came
to stand on the pool deck and support their
fellow teammates. Said Taft, “Due to the fact
that our meet was on the night of Court Se-
lection, it was really great to have such strong
support not only from the guys on our team
but from our peers as well. I was impressed
with the large turnout of friends who came to
cheer all of us on.”

The women’s swim team scored 112.5 points Friday night in its first meet of the semester.

Perez reiterated that the hard work and com-
mitment that the women’s team endured dur-
ing their winter training trip truly showed and
paid off in this meet: “Despite the loss, the
close finish and the breadth of season-best and

team-best times can perhaps foreshadow what
we hope will be a strong finish to the season.”

The men’s and women’s teams will come
together next weekend for back-to-back meets
at Duke on Jan. 21 and at UNC Wilmington

on Jan. 22.
In two weeks, the women will host Radford
and the men will host VMI in the ’Cats’ last

home meet for the seniors on Saturday, Jan.
29.

Wrestling snaps undefeated record with losses in duals

Wildcats begin Virginia
Duals with 27- 24 victory

over McDaniel before
losing two matches

By Pierce TRUMBO

The wrestling team entered this past
weekend’s Virginia Duals with a perfect 5-0
record, their best start in 38 years, but the
Wildcats were unable to continue the perfect
streak in losing two of three matches overall.

Seeded third in the tournament, the ’Cats
started well with a 27-24 victory over

McDaniel College. The team dominated the ”

lower weight classes and won the first six
matches.
Patrick Coman ’06 had an 11-4 win at 125

and Benjamin Graham ’08 had an 8-3 win at
149.

Travis Hunter ’06 had a big win 5-4 win at
133, filling in for the injured Jim Avola ’07 in
what was one of the main turning points of
the match, according to captain Matt Leonard
06.

Leonard pinned his opponent in 24 seconds
in the 141 pound weight class and Matt Pendle
’08 pinned his opponent in 4:24 at 157.

The last victory went to Trebor Clevette ’08,
who won by default in the 165 weight class.
The Wildcats lost their final four matches, but
it did not matter as the win was already se-
cured.

The following day, however, the Wildcats
were unable to continue their perfect start to
the season, as they lost to South Dakota State
and SUNY-Brockport.

Against South Dakota State the ’Cats again
started well with a pin by Coman at the 1:39

mark and an 11-5 victory by Hunter. South
Dakota State, however, marched on to win six
of the next eight contests as well as the match,
31-15. The other Wildcat victories were by
Graham, 11-8, and Clevette, who beat his op-
ponent 5-4.

Later in the day, the team went up against
SUNY-Brockport and fell 28-13. Coman and
Graham both won again to go a combined 6-0
on the weekend. Unfortunately, the only other
wins came from Pendle and Clevette, and that
was not enough to secure the overall victory.

“Everybody wrestled hard,” Coman
said,“but the breaks just didn’t go our way. If
another match or two would have gone our
way, we could easily have won that tourna-
ment.” Leonard added, “Overall our team
showed we can compete at that level and win.”

At 6-2, the team is off to a great start and
has already eclipsed last year’s win total by
two (4-13). Coman attributes the difference

at least partially to the freshmen class,
saying,“A big reason for us starting so well
this year has been our freshman; they have
been amazingly consistent throughout the sea-
son and they haven’t looked like freshmen at
all out there.

Coman also said that the change could be a
result of the team’s camaraderie, saying, ‘““We
also have a tight-knit team that has allowed
us to win the close matches. If one person
doesn’t get the job done, the next person has
been able to pick up the slack and keep us
going and that has made the difference be-
tween the past and this year.”

Leonard, looking ahead to the upcoming
schedule, said, “For now we just have to get
back in the room and work our tails off get-
ting ready for conference matches.” The
team’s conference schedule starts at home on
Wednesday when the Wildcats face UNC-
Greensboro.
