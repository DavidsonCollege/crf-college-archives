Harris Teeter pulls out of Town Center

By JT ToLentTino
Staff Writer

Two possible additions to downtown
Davidson have sparked discussion among
townspeople lately. The Town Center Project,
including the construction of a Harris Teeter
Express, and a proposal for new town homes
have both been under consideration promis-
ing to change the landscape of Davidson
while respecting its character.

The Town Centerrecently announced, how-
ever, that a grocery store would not be com-
ing. Late last November, Harris Teeter, Inc.,
pulled out of the plan to put a “Harris Teeter
Express” in the new Town Center project
developed by the Stevens Company. The
land where the new building was to be built

‘had already been cleared, and the historic
Blake House had moved to a new lot 300 feet

away.

“Weare very disappointed. I think that this
is a good project [for Harris Teeter],” said
Mayor Randy Kincaid. Mayor Kincaid be-
lieves that the Harris Teeter Express would
have been a great addition to the town.

“Tt is possible that Harris Teeter will come
back,” he added.

The Harris Teeter Express is a scaled-
down version of the Harris Teeter, and would
have resembled the store of the same name
located on Providence Road in Charlotte.
The grocery store would have featured a
smaller stock of items, but specializing in
ready-to-eat foods, such as prepared meals.

In the original plan, the Town Center project
included 19 conditions that the Stevens Com-
pany had to meet, including a provision that
Harris Teeter had to be the main tenet of the
project, The new building, located on the
corner of Main and Concord, would contain
13,500 square feet, with the Harris Teeter
Express occupying the bottom floor and of-
fices occupying the second.

According to Jessica Walton, spokesper-
son for Harris Teeter, “Harris Teeter never
signed a lease [for the Town Center] because
the company believed that the store would
not be financially successful.” Harris Teeter
already operates two other grocery stores in
the North Mecklenburg area.

With Harris Teeter now out of the picture,
the ‘Stevens Company is now looking for
another store to anchor the Town Center.
However, according to Mayor Kincaid, the
Stevens Company does nothave to gothrough

the entire process of making the proposal to

the town, as they did earlier last year.’ “Basi-
cally, all they have to do is re-amend the
proposal [for a new tenant].”

Town planner and Davidson graduate
Meredith Judy ’00 indicated that “the same
people will probably fight [the proposal]
again” when the Stevens Company comes

bikes that are coming,” he commented.

The candidates bring many new ideas with
them. Harris identifies five issues that would
be his top priorities if elected. He wants to
make SGA more ac-
cessible and user- [i
friendly. He also in-
tends to prove that
SGA is aresource for
budding new organi-
zations by providing
publicity, funding
and chartering.
Thirdly, he feels that
SGA needs to con-
tinue to be involved
in community ser-
vice. Next, he sees it
as necessary for the
president to encour-
age discussion of
campus problems
and issues. Finally,
and most impor-
tantly, Harris wants to be a “voice of the
students to the trustees, administration and

faculty. That’s what I’ve been doing. We
need to continue representing the interest of
students.”

“If theres anything I want to be for, win or
lose, it’s that I worked hard for my peers,” he
said.

Pittenger is run-
ning on the slogan
“Leadership with Re-
sults.” He names sev-
eral goals that he
plans to accomplish
if elected. He wants
to make sure that
clocks are in every
classroom in order to
make the day run
more smoothly.
Along with the online
forum, he’d like to
establish a newslet-
ter to inform the stu-
dents of the SGA’s
activities. He also

ington, D.C.

ceived three ambassadorships: to Congo,
Ivory Coast and Ghana. He also served as the

rica and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State for African Affairs.

Brown came to Davidson in 1995 hoping to
integrate his background in foreign service
with the education of young adults. As Direc-
tor of the Dean Rusk Program for Interna-
tional Studies, he oversees the: program’s
educational initiatives as well as its. grants’
allocations. He also teaches courses in the
Political Science department, including Con-
flict Resolution and African Politics.

While at Davidson, Brown has introduced
colleagues from his foreign service career to
Davidson. “‘The advantage of someone com-

ing in from the outside is that he also brings
his contacts with him,” said Brown. In recent
years, Davidson has hosted Jane Goodall,
photographers Carol Beckworth and Angela
Fisher and the Director General of the World
Wildlife Fund, Claude Martin. Brown has
also facilitated the organization of confer-
ences including those addressing US-China
relations, Faith and Affairs of Nations and
International Conservation in the New Mil-
lennium. ‘

Along with the Office of Development,
