THE DAVIDSONIAN, February 5, 1920.

Who, What and Where
Among the Alumni

PROF. MACON REED HAS
WON THE HIGH ESTEEM
OF ALL THE STUDENTS

During His Four-year Stay He Has
Done Much for Davidson.

Macon Reed showed a patriotic |
spirit early in life, for he celebrated
July 4, 1879, by beginning his earth-
ly pilgrimage. That important event
happened at Charlotte Court House,
Virginia. After preparation in the
University Preparatory School, he
entered Vanderbilt in 1896, After
three vears’ work there he went to
the Presbyterian High School.
where he taught for three years.
Having taught at Roland, N. C.. for
another year, he went to the Uni-
versity uf South Carolina as Asso-
ciate Professor of Mathematics, re-
ceiving his A.. degree in that year,
1905. After two years as a civil
engineer in West Virginia and a
year as professor in the Peacock
Military School, in) San Antonio.
Tex., he went to Fayetteville. N.C.
where he built the Donaldson Mili-
tary Academy and ran it for eight
vears, He then came to Davidson
as Associate Professor of Greck and
Latin,

For the past four years Professor
Reed has been at Davidson, and in
that time he has endeared himself to
those who have been under him in a
way peculiarly his own. For pre-
cision and lucidity in explanation,
jor an infinite patience in making’
clear every detail of a subject, for an
accuracy and fairness in grading
that is wholly unequalled, Professor
Reed has made himself known to all
who have been his students. To all
who have known him he has ever
been a pleasant friend. Though she
cannot claim him as an alumnus,
Davidson is proud to claim for her-
self the honor of his services as a
professor, and that that tie will en-
dure for many years to come.

STUDENT BODY EXTENDS
SYMPATHY TO BUCK CURRIE
IN LOSS OF HIS FATHER

The Davidson fellows who know
and love Buek Currie extend their
sincere sympathies to him in the
death of his father, Mr. John Henry
Currie. Mr. Currie, who had been
sick for some time, died on January
21.) He was a farmer and lived in
the Seventy-first district, in Cum-
berland county, N.C. He was a
man of wide prominence, having
served both m the North Carolina
Legislature and the National Dem-
ocratic Convention, Mr. Currie is
also widely known as a Christian
gentleman, being one of the most
highly esteemed men in the section
of the country in which he lived. To
luse such a father is a great bereave-
ment, but ty have had one is a great-
er heritage.

Band Has Become Important

(Continued from page 1)
fore, he has applied his thorough
knowledge 6f military drill to his
leadership of the band, and many of
the’ compliments which it has re-
ceived are due to Sergeant Dunn's
interest and skill.

Thus the band has become an es-
tablished Davidson institution; it is
here to stay. And we all agree that
ny other one thing has done more to
make Davidson attractive. It has
also given D.C. a large amount of
free advertising, which is one of the
steps in the realization of our
dreams for “a bigger and a better
Davidson.”

Second Heutenant, D. Ro Freeman,
leader and cornet; tirst sergeant, C.
