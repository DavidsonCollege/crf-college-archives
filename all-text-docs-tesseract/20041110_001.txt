School increases job
opportunites with SLAC

By Carey BAXTER
Staff Writer

Many Davidson seniors do not per-
ceive Career Services as very help-
ful in finding jobs outside of the tra-
ditional medical, law, and banking
sectors.

“Tdon’tthink my friends utilize the
services because they aren’t seeking
typical jobs,” said Brian Creech ’04.

In order to expand its employer
base, Davidson joined the Selective
Liberal Arts Consortium (SLAC) this
year, creating new job interview op-
portunities for Davidson seniors.

Director of Career Services John
Adams said Davidson joined SLAC
“to make ourselves more present to
a broader range of employers.”

SLAC is comprised of 12 small
liberal arts colleges ranked in the U.S.
Newsand World Report “Top 50 Best
National Liberal Arts Colleges.”

Each year SLAC hosts pre-ar-

-ranged interview days in five major
U.S. cities: Boston, Chicago, New
York City, Philadelphia, and Wash-
ington D.C.

Out of the 26 companies partici-
pating in the interview day in Wash-
ington, only three have previously
come to Davidson for on-campus in-
terviews.

By gathering together in a conve-
nient location, the small liberal arts
colleges thatmake up SLAC are able

to open themselves up to more em-
ployers than would usually trek to
their disparate locations to seek out
students.

About 30 Davidson students ap-
plied online this October for inter-
views with SLAC corporations, gov-
ernmentemployers, and/or nonprofit
organizations.

Those students selected for inter-
views will travel to one of the five
cities in December or January to meet
with representatives of different or-
ganizations.

Because this is Davidson’s first
year as a SLAC member, Davidson
students are only invited to partici-
pate in the day of interviews in Wash-
ington D.C.

Davidson must earn its way into
the other four cities by attracting new
companies to the list of participating
companies in each city. Davidson
hopes to add one or more cities next
year, said Adams.

The problem, said Kate McVane
°04 who interns at Career Services,
is that many students are so busy that
they don’t make time to utilize these
resources.

Dan Coslett ’04, majoring Classics
and Political Science, said “[Career
Services’] resume workshops and
specialized career panels are pretty
good but they should be clearer about
how much they help with the grad

Communication between the F Patterson Court Council
and Campus Safety is hoped to make parties safer.

Patterson Court, police
seek to i improve relations

By Liz Barry
Senior Staff Writer

Recent concerns about the rela-
tionship between students and police
officers on Patterson Court have
prompted efforts to open the lines of

communication and seek acommon_

ground.

Studentconcerns stem from incon-
sistent enforcement of PCC policies,
the presence of town police at cam-
pus parties and a general lack of com-
munication between Campus Safety
and the leaders of Patterson Court
Organizations, said Weston
Waxweiler ’0O5, president of
Patterson Court Council.

Several PCC representatives met

-- with Chief of Police Fountain

Walker, Dean of Students Tom
Shandley and Patterson Court Advi-
sor Joy Hamm this afternoon to dis-
cuss tensions between students and
campus safety officers.

Lack of communication between
the PCC leaders and campus safety
is the main cause of the strained re-
lationship between students and of-
ficers, Warner Hall president Rachel
Voyles ’05 said.

“T think all too often negative feel-
ings result when students are unsure
of police officers’ intentions and
when police officers are unsure of the
level of respect students have for
them,” Voyles said.

For those who include a trip to
Davidson’s Summit coffeehouse in
their daily routine, the temporary
closing of Summit this week is an
unexpected shock.

Since its inception as Davidson’s
very own coffee shop six years ago,

Summit has become a main street —

staple and never closed its doors
during regular store hours with the
exception of yearly holidays.
However, repeated water damage
forced managementto close the store
for four days this week in order to
primarily replace floor tiling
Besides serving coffee, Summit is
best known for its quaint atmosphere

year-old building it is housed in.

The building’s old-age, while af-
fording many aesthetic benefits for
management, employees, and cus-
tomers, has also contributed to con-
sistent water damage.

During rainy days, customers
would have been unsurprised to find
towels strewn across the floor in or-
der to keep the coffee shop from
becoming an indoor swamp.

- Although re-tiling the floor is the
major‘reason for closing down the
shop this week, management decided
to renovate other parts of the store at
the same time.

Among these projects include
painting the bottom parts of the walls
arich, dark green while painting the

upper walls a more grayish green -

Four nominated
for Watson

By Don WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Davidson has named its four nomi-
nees for the 2005 Thomas J. Watson
Fellowship. Amanda Green ’05, Wil-
liam Haas ’05, Kristy Marynak ’05
and Ben Nelson ’05 have submitted
formal proposals to the Thomas J.
Watson Foundation after having been
selected by the Dean of Students
Office to compete for some of the 50
fellowships offered to students at 50
private institutions nationwide.

Watson Fellowships provide
graduating college seniors with a
one-year grant for independent study
and travel abroad.

According to a description by the
Career Services web page on gradu-
ate fellowships, “Students have an
opportunity for a focused and disci-
plined Wandarjahr of their own de-
vising - time in which to explore with
thoroughness a particular interest,
test their aspirations and abilities,
view their lives and American soci-
ety in greater perspective and, con-
comitantly, to develop a more in-
formed sense of international con-
cern.”

The Watson Fellowship provides
a grant of $22,000to make this expe-
rience possible.

The nominees were chosen after
an application process that included
submission of a three-page proposal
and a personal statement, a list of ex-
tracurricular activities, two faculty
recommendations and a series of
interviews.

Green proposal is titled “Lan-
guage Revitalization: Preserving
Unique Forms of Human Expres-
sion.”

Haas submitted “The International
Scouting Movement: Fusing Culture
and Developing Youth.”

Marynak’s topic is “Sounding To-
gether: Dynamics and Demograph-
ics of Youth Symphonies in Chile,
Dominican Republic, India and
South Africa.”

Nelson has chosen “Stringing To-
gether My Tradition.”

Green is seeking to travel to Rus-
sia, China and Namibia to live in
communities that have programs
aimed at preventing the loss of local
languages and preserving oral his-
tory.

Green will work with these pro-

and cozy store interior. color. grams, enrolling in classes and work-
