VOL 2.

Davidson is Trium-
phant Over Emory

Price and Smith Win Debate at
Agues Scott.

At the Davidson-Emory debate, held
laste Monday night in the chapel of Agnes
Scott College, the Red and Black was
carried to victory by the Davidson team,
F, W. Price and F. H. South, ‘The sub-
ject was, “Resolved, ‘That an alliance of
all American countries should take the
place of the Monroe Doctrine.” “The
vote stood three te two in tavor of the
affirmative, and the victory was indeed 4
well-earned one. |

When the team reached Atlanta they
were met by a delegation from the At-
Janta Alumni Asociation, and were taken
in automobiles through the finest  rest-
dence districts of the city. On their re-
turn to the Ansley Hotel an informal
luncheon was given in their honor, at
which nineteen) Davidson men were
present. “here were a few brief ad-
dresses by both alumni and visiturs, and

the team was much encouraged by such |

a demonstration of the “Davidson
spirit.”

The debate began at 8:30, and long
before that time the chapel was filled to
overflowing, and much enthusiasm was
shown by the supporters of each college.
Vhe Agnes Scott student body, though
supposedly neutral, gave Davidson a
hearty welcome, and the decision was a
popular one. At the conclusion of the
debate the victory tor Davidson seemed
assured, for though Emory had the best
team we have faced in years. Smith and
Price were absolutely irresistable in their
magnificent rejoinders, and the Emory
contingent was overwhelmed.

In opening the dehate for the affirm
ative, FLW. Price. the first speaker.
argued that an alliance ot all the Amer
ican countries is more desirable than the
Monroe Doctrine. and that tt is prac
ticable. Fle confined his speech to a
demonstration of the short-comings ot
the present policy: proving it to be un
just to Latin-America; to be a menace
to the friendly relations with those coun
tries. and to be the possible cause of fu-
ture complications. His argument was
clear, forceful and logical: and at no

time owas it seriously — endangered
throughout the entire debate. He
proved satisfactorily that the United

States is looked upon as dominecring
over American affairs. and for this reas-
on is unpopular in the South American
countries.

The first speaker for the negative.
Fred W. Flabree. of McRae, Ga,, gave
most of his speech to a history of the
Monroe Doctrine, proving its former
success, all of which the affirmative
easily admitted. He argued that such
an alliance would be the substitution of
an iron-clad contract for a flexible pol-
icy: an unwise change.

F. H. Smith, the second speaker for
Davidson, then took the floor, and, amid
vociferous applause. rapidly pointed out
the error of the negative in so interpret-
ing the question as to make the affirm-
ative prove the practicability of initia-
tion of the Alliance. He pointed out
that the question read that such an al-
liance should and would not take the
place of the Monroe Doctrine, and dis-
claimed any powers of discernment into
the future legislative minds of South
America. He continued the affirmative
defense in giving a history of similar
successful alliances in America to prove
the practicability of this one: and proved
that the alliance would substitute equal-
itv for meddlesomeness: would strength-
‘en otir position as a world power. and
