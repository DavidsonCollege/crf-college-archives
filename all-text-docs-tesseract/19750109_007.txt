The Davidsonian

Seven.

Davidson’s basketball team is
experiencing its longest losing
streak since 1961.

The last four of these came
during Christmas break. This
four game stretch was supposed
to be one of the toughest for the
rate and it proved to be just

Gy

Drive-In

The first four games included
defending NCAA champion
N.C. State which at the time
was ranked number one in the
country. Also former NCAA
champion U.C.L,A. had to be
played. The other two games
were Brigham Young and San-
ta Barbara, both on the road.

The first game of the series
was N.C. State at Charlotte. The

Wolfpack got off to an early
lead led by All-American David
Thompson. State went to the
locker room at halftime with a
comfortable 46-33 lead.

. The Wildcats were not done,
however, as they came back in
the second half and with twelve
minutes remaining had cut
State’s lead to two at 59-57.

That was as close as the Cats
could come, however, as David
Thompson again and again put
in alley-oop passes for scores.
State lengthened their lead and
ended up winning 95-79.

4 Davidson played after com-

ing off of losses to Richmond,
Princeton and William & Mary.

Leading scorers for the Cats
were Greg Dunn and Larry
Horowitz with 20. Tom Verlin
and Jay Powell had 14 and 12
respectively.

Thompson ended up with 43
points, which is more than he
had scored in his two games
prior to Davidson combined.
Kenny Carr, a freshman for-
ward, added 21 puints for State.

Davidson then travelled to
Provo, Utah to play in the
largest college basketball arena
in the country, Marriot Center,
which holds 22,000 against

_ Brigham Young University.

The game was close in the
early going with both teams
having the lead. With just over 4

Fallible Freek Misses Some,
Meditates Cats, Super Bowl

After remembering many of
my bowl game predictions, I
am Sure that some readers
made New Year’s resolutions
never to read this column again.
. But, Davidson fans, have
faith! Even though yours truly
predicted Brigham Young, Ma-
ryland, Texas, Georgia, and
most notabl labama winners,
this seer als& had the Peach
Bowl tie, the Nébraska-Florida
spread, and the U.S.C. upset of
Ohio State.

And to top it off, the ‘“‘Freek’’
(formerly ‘‘Freak’’) has hit the
Davidson basketball spreads
practically on thenose.

For example, the State
prediction of 18 was only off by 2
as was the U.C.L.A. spread of
25, although the latter was ac-
cidentally\ omitted in the last
issue.

I know many of ‘you are ex-
pecting * more __ sardonic,
* scathing comments on .the
current 2-8 basketball record.
Okay. I did not personally see
the Santa Barbara game but I
didn’t have to to know the story.
A rebounding deficiency of 48-16
is simply unbelievable! ;

This weekend I make St.
Johns an eight point favorite.
The big question for the rest of
the season seems to be ‘‘Can
Davidson salvage a 10-win
season?’’ With the upcoming

schedule, it will be real tough.

As Alan Edmonds -put it ap-
propriately, Davidson may be
quickly becoming the ‘‘Wake
Forest of basketball,’’ referring
to Wake’s ridiculous scheduling
of Oklahoma, Penn State and
other ‘‘biggies’’ in football.

I’ll hold the rest of the biting
commentary until later in the
season, after the Wildcats have
played East Carolina, V.M.I.,
and others their own size.

The world has’ enough
disasters without having to look
at Davidson’s, so why don’t we
move on to pro sports.

Viewing the present pro
hockey and basketball seasons,
one may ponder over this
crucial question, ‘Who will end
up with a better (or worse, it
depends on how you look at it)
record, the New Orleans Jazz of
the NBA or the Washington
Capitals of the NHL?”’ (It’s nip
and tuck right now.)

After seeing the Flyers a
couple of times over the
vacation, I don’t see how they
can lose this year. (I also said
the same thing about N.C. State
in basketball , so take it as you
may.)

In the NBA, there doesn’t
seem to be one overpowering
team like the past few years.
The finals will most likely will

match Boston and’ Milwaukee
again.

I know most of you aren’t in
the hockey or basketball mood
yet, so here goes my fling at the
Super Bowl. For the past two

months, I’ve called Pittsburgh
all the way, and I’m sure not

backing out now. Their defense
against Oakland was awesome.
Minnesota has an unexciting of-
fense, so I make the game
Steelers by 6.

Answer : They’d better!

Ext. Happy Hour — Thurs. 7 - 9:30

minutes namalitiiic in the first
half the score was tied at 30.

The Cougars then scored 12 of
the last 14 points in the half to
lead 42-32.

Davidson attempted. to come
back in the. second half, but
could not get closer than six
points.

Brigham Young increased
their lead late in the half and
won 90-76. The Cougars balance
a scoring attack with ‘five
players in double figures and no
one with over 15 points.

Larry Horowitz led Davidson
with 20 points. Jay Powell and
Greg Dunn had 18 and 13.
Freshman Kevin Doherty had
his best game of the season as
he contributed 14 points.

Davidson then travelled to
Los Angeles and Pauley
Pavillion to play the number
three ranked Bruins of U.C.L.A.
The Bruins showed why they
were ranked where they are as
they beat the Cats 91-64.

U.C.L.A. controlled the boar-

‘ds and blocked many:shots as

they enjoyed a big height ad-
vantage. Dave Myers and sixth
man Marques Johnson led the
Bruins with 23 and 16 points
respectively.

Greg Dunn was Davidson’ s
leading scorer with 14. Kevin
Doherty and Larry Horowitz
had 12 and 11.

The next night the Cats
travelled 100 miles up the

9 Streak Reaches Seven

Pacific Coast to play the-
University of California at
Santa Barbara.

Midway through the first half
the score was tied at 16. As the
half progressed, however, San-
ta Barbara started building up

@a lead as they continually got

two or more shots each time
down the floor.

At the half, the Gaucho’s of
Santa Barbara led 42-28. The
start of the second half killed
the Wildcats as Santa Barbara
scored the first six points. The
closest Davidson could come af-
ter that was twelve points.

The final score was 91-75.

Dave Brown, U.C.S.B.’s cen-
ter led all scorers with 21 points.
Jay Powell was Davidson’s high
scorer’ with 16. Eppa. Rixey,
Greg Dunn and Sheldon Parker
ail had 10.

Davidson’s major problems
in the last four games were
rebounding and _ shooting.
Davidson teams of the past
have always had trouble on the
boards, but made up for it with
good shooting. This year’s team
ro not been able to do that thus
ar.

The best shooting percentage
Davidson had in the four games
was 47.89 against N.C. State.
The worst was 38.2% against
U.C.L.A.
