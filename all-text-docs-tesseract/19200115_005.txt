Moines Conference had _ hardly
boarded the train before they began
to meet men who were proud to
claim Davidson as their Alma Ma-

completed, these men had gotten
together and planned a Davidson
reunion luncheon to be staged in the

Tre marvels of electricity have revolutionized our manu-

Such an institution is marvelous—superhuman—made thus
