At 2a.m., things “are just starting to pick up” at Ham and Eggs

By JEFF HERRIN
Features Editor

“TI didn’t know anyone would
be here!”” peeped a distraught
voice from the back seat as we
pulled into the Ham and Eggs
parking lot. I, too, was a bit
surprised to find the small
Cornelius restaurant so crowded
at such a late hour, even though
I had been warned beforehand.

Nonetheless, I was deter-
mined to have some legendary
Ham and Eggs food, and my
editor had-me quite excited
about chronicling ‘‘the Ham
and Eggs experience’’, so I
went about convincing my com-
panions to go in with me. John
Krotchko was ready and wil-
ling, but Cindy Faulkenberry,
owner of the peeping distraught
voice, required no little persu-
asion. Perhaps because she
wore only a bathrobe, perhaps
not. In any case, we managed to
drag her in.

We pressed through the
crowd to the only available
table. (I don’t think anyone
even noticed Cindy—I assured
her that it was because her red
bathrobe so resembled an even-
ing gown). A smiling waitress
appeared immediately, gave us
each a menu, and went off to get
us some coffee. ~

She returned a few moments
later and began to chat. Cindy’s
bathrobe caught her attention
(at last!), and she assumed
immediately that Cindy was
being initiated. No, said, Cin-
dy, ‘‘I just expected this place
to be, uh, empty.’’ The waitress
assured Cindy that her atire
was not so unusual: ‘“‘Why just
last week, there were four
people in here wearing nothing
but pajamas.”’ Maybe they were
escapees from the SPE pajama
party.

As she bustled off to get our
food ready, ,I began to take in
my surroundings—this was my
first visit to ‘Waffle World”’, as
some, affectionately call it.*I
immediately noticed the wide
varieties of people ceming and
going—more coming than go-
ing. A group of students were
carrying on quietly at one of the
other tables. A trio of truck-
drivers in blue overalls stood in
one corner in sharp contrast to a
group of men and women in
three peice suits and evening
_ gowns. The grill behind the
counter sizzled steadily, compe-
ting with a jukebox which

blared ‘‘Cupid, I’ve loved you

for a long time.”’

The waitress returned with
our orange juice, homemade
biscuits, country ham, grits,
and eggs. I mentioned how
busy the joint seemed and she

lit into what was apparently one
of her favorite topics.

“Oh, this is nothing. You just
wait around ’til about two or
three. Why, that’s when we
start doing the real business.
Things are just starting to
pick up.”’ Why? ‘‘This is Satur-
day night, and people want to

eat: This is it—all the way to
Virginia.’’ (She also told why
Ham and Eggs accepts student
checks only with alpha numbers
—‘“That way, the whole school
gets on your ass.”’)

Business was picking up. A
large group of young people
came in (staggered, actually)
and leaned against the wall
opposite our table, waiting for a
place to sit.

John asked one if they were
Davidson students. —

‘“‘What? Everyone knows
Davidson students never get
drunk. Especially underage
freshmen,’’ one of them an-
swered. Of course not. When
pressed further, one of their
party admitted that they had
been at the freshman Halloween
Party. ‘‘And boy, did they have
a lot of beer! After that there
was nothing to do but come out
here.’’ And it wasn’t even
Halloween.

John, Cindy,~and myself
turned our conversation to the
question at hand— Why were all
these people here, at this time of

night? John, poor thing, in- .

sisted I fake the standard
reporter approach and aggres-
sively accost some one. I agreed
to try it and w over to a
Willie Nelson-looking charac-
ter. He impressed me as having
just left an ‘“‘Urban Cowboy”
party, with dingo boots, head-
to-toe denim, and an alligator

skin hat.

“Evening,” I said.

‘‘Evening,’’ he conceded,
peering out from under the brim
of his hat.

“Excuse me, but I’m doing a
sorta report on why people come
to Ham and Eggs. I wondered if
I might talk to you for a
minute.”’

“T reckon ya already are,” he
replied.

After a moment, I regained
my composure and asked him

Film Review

the development of Western

ponse? ‘‘I was hungry.”

So much for John and his
methodical approach. I was
ready to try the conversational
approach, so I looked about for
a likely candidate. I spotted one
of the well-dressed men who had
come in earlier with the ladies in

evening gowns. He was stand-
ing alone at the moment, so I
walked over, my worst mistake
of the evening.

“Evening, sir,”’ say I.

‘“‘“Good evening. How are
you?”’ he asks. I respond appro-
priately, commenting on the
weather .and other trivialities.

.Set in a not-too-distant fu-

resonant political fable of the
need for individualism in a
dehumanized and oppressive
industrial society. In the top-

going to be of little use: he
never knew the place was here
before tonight. It appeared I
would have to talk to someone
else, but first I had to break off
the conversation with this guy,

(David McCurry)

who was getting uncomfortably
friendly.

I tried to excuse myself, and
was promptly propositioned
with a ‘‘don’t you want to play

I looked for John and Cindy,
who had started toward the
cash register (I think Cindy was
now drawing more _attention—
the robe stood out so), and we

The first sci-fi film not silent in message

ing (for the period) sophisti-
cated effects. _
As the ruling class attempts

_ to manipulate the rebels by the

judicious use of science in the

form of Rotwand, a particularly
manic version of the mad-
scientist character, and by sex
in the form of his chief creation,
an attractive robot much given
to erotic gyrations, Lang’s

‘imagery becomes increasingly

profound. The sequences of the
Seven Deadly. Sins in the Cath-
edral and the vision of Molock
are effortlessly awesome in their
effect, and the film is worth
seeing for this footage alone.
Metropolis is a consistently
rivetting and thought-pro-
voking piece of cinema: I cannot
urge you too strongly to make a
date to see this important and
justly-celebrated film. —

Metropolis will be shown
