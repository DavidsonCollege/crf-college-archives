Fraternities: Rumor Vs. Reality

The college’s pian tq invest over
a quarter of a million dollars in a
completely new fraternity court can
be interpreted as a 100% endorse-
ment of the fraternity system. ;

Over the years there has persisted
a rumor that the ultimate goal of the
faculty is to abolish the fraternities,
and if not to abolish them, then to
restrict their ability to function in a
desireable manner. Of course, such
a rumor has no real foundation.

Certainly a planned investment of
$30.000 per fraternity makes such a
rumor seem ridiculous. If the college
wanted to undermine the fraternities,
it would be much easier (and more
subtle) to let them slowly die-out by
not making any plans for their future
welfare.

Fortunately, this is not the case.
To the contrary, Davidson College is
irivesting its financial resources in
support of the fraternities as a perm-
anent institution within the college
system.

This action is particularly signi-.
ficant when we realize that the fra-
ternity system as a whole has come

in for some devastating attacks in re-
cent years. We have read recently
about some northern schools that
have meddled directly in the personal
and autonomous affairs of the fra-
ternities on their campuses, particu-
larly with regard to the so-called “re-
Strictive clauses” which are, after all,
the very heart of the fraternity sys-
tem.

The right of voluntary association
is a major justification of any fra-
ternal group. Take away this right
to be ‘exclusive’ and you have killed
the fraternity. Wisely, such an alien
idea has never been considered at
Davidson. Therefore, the college’s
backing of the new court amounts to
a vote of confidence in our present
system.

Among those who have unselfish-

ly worked and pushed for the new
plan are Mr. Grier Martin, Dr. Mc-

Gavock, and Dean Spencer. The sup-
port of such men as these, as well
as programs like last Wednesday’s
forum (see the ‘news article on the
front page) will ensure Davidson Col-
lege of a dynamic fraternity system.

Roses To
Mrs. Little

Mrs. Little’s resignation as Super-
visor of the Do.mitories does not
mean that she will be leaving David-
son. Rather, she is just moving to
a new office where she will be the
hostess of the Student Union, as well
as plan the meals in the cafeteria.

We are glad that she is taking
over this new position, and if her
home-cooked meals which so many
Davidson boys have enjoyed are any
indication of what the new change
will mean, we predict a mass run to
the Union.

Since Spring ‘Frolics will be the
last time that she will be on duty
in Belk Hotel, we want to thank her .
for these many years of helping on
the dance week-ends. This goes also
for the other ladies from the David-
son community who stay up all night
over a pot of coffee.

To Mrs. J. B. Moore, Jr., the new
Supervisor of the Dormitories, we ex-
press our welcome and hope that you
will find your new position a pleasant
one.

Job Well Done

This issue of the Davidsonian is
the first published by the new staff.

With sincere gratitude, we want
to recognize publicly the Senior mem-
bers of the out-going staff for their
work, ideas, and contributions which
made the 1956-57 Davidsonian the in-
formative and provocative paper that
_it was.

Jim Batten has given the paper
his energies and his loyalty. His con-
tinuous efforts were many times
made at the expense of his academic
work and other personal desires. This
spirit of unselfishness has won for
him the respect and admiration of all
those who worked with him, as well
as the student body and the college
administration.

From his first issue until his last,
he has seen that the Davidsonian has
met its responsibility of being the
news and editorial voice of the cam-
pus by insuring that those matters

which concern Davidson College also
concern the Davidsonian.

He has been an efficient adminis-
trator, an enterprising editor, and a
good friend.

One of the hardest working and
most dependable members of this
year’s staff was Bob Beall. His en-
thusiasm for the paper has been one
of the main factors that contributed
to the success of the Davidsonian.

The conscientious and co-operative
handling of the fiscal matters of the
paper by Business Manager Bob Car-
michael and Advertising Manager
Bob Majors qualifies them for a much
needed position in the budget depart-
ment of the federal government.

Photographer Hank Daniel has
continued to furnish the paper with
superior work, and the Wednesday
night copy reading by John Trotti has
undoubtedly saved the Davidsonian
from many financially devastating li-
bel suits.

The hard-plugging editorials of
Frank Bloodworth, Leon Howell, Nat
Daniel, Tom Morgan, Phil Kukura,
Jack Kerr and several others have
helped to bring about several needed
reforms. Their remarks have been
timely and persuasive.

While those who are mentioned
above will be graduating in June, the
hardest worker of all will still remain.
He is the printer, Mr. H. C. Broyles
who has survived many past editors
of the Davidsonian, and without a
doubt he will withstand many more.

Irony

How ironical it is that some of
the liberals and labor leaders who
have done so much to restrict the
rights of the individual as guaranteed
by the Constitution have been the
very people who have run for cover
under its protective wing.

While they might not have much
respect for the rest of the Constitu-
tion, you can bet your “Palm Springs
home” and “interest-free loans” that
Mr. Dave Beck and Associates en-
dorse the Fifth Amendment.

CAUDLE

Rarely do we entertain feminine guidance on our all male
campus. This week, however, as a special feature of the David-
sonian, eight charming young ladies were asked by letter to lend
their invigorating charm to the editorial page by answering two

rather important questions:

1. What do you tike most sbout Spring Frolics at Davidson?

2. Is having a “name band” necessary to make the weekend

a@ success?

Their answers follow:
LYNN RICHARDSON

Lynn - Richardson, dating
Bob McCrea commented:

1. Spring Frolics, as a whole,
is wonderful, but I think that
perhaps the main attraction
for me is the formal dance. My
reason for this choice is be-
cause there are so few dances
of this type throughout the
year.

2. No. I do not think that d
“name band” is necessary to
make a weekend a success. |
believe that the success of a
dance, or weekend is dependent
upon the people themselves,
their attitude, and the atmos-
phere which has been created.

However, I am sure that a
“name band” definitely adds to
a dance!

GLORIA HESTER

Gloria Hester, dating Vernon
Anderson added:

1. I like the friendly atmos-
phere of the Davidson campus.
The dance weekends are always
well-planned, and all of the
events are enjoyable.

2. It is definitely not neces-
sary to have a “name band” to
make a weekend a = success.
Often a band which is not so
well known will have: music
which is superior to the others.
I would say choose the band by

its musical ability and not by
its name.

KITTY SUE FAULCONER

Kitty Sue Faulconer, ‘ dating
Tommy Hawpe suggested:

1. “In the Spring a young
man’s faney lightly turns to
thoughts of love,” and what
could be more condusive to
such thoughts than the delight-
ful atmosphere of a Spring Fro-
lics weekend! Need I say more
concerning what I like most
about this memorable occasion?

2. Concerning the necessity
of a “name band”, a “name”
does nothing to add to one’s
dancing enjoyment. So long as
the music is dancable, the
weather tolerable, and the com-
pany enjoyable, the weekend
will be a success!

MARJI BISSON

Marji_ Bisson, dating Ed
Stevens admitted:

1. The best thing about Spring
Frolics is that it is Spring, with
warmer weather and more
things to do. Spring Frolics is
the last big dance weekend of
the academic year, and crowd-
ed into those three wonderful
days are enough fun = and
memories to last throughout
the summer.

2. Danceable music is im-
portant to the success of a
weekend; however, it does not
necessarily take a name band
to provide such music. Thus, a
name band cannot be consid-
ered the determining factor in
measuring the success of a
dance weekend.

EMILY SAPP

Emily Sapp, dating Henry
Massey stated:

1. The last “Big Week” of the
year brings to mind thoughts
of Frolics, Foolies, picnics at
the river, lawn concerts, and an
overall carefree atmosphere
characteristic of Spring at Da-
vidson. However, with these

Students, Faculty Comment;
President Must Be Versatile

By CHARLES CHASTAIN

Since Dr. Cunningham's
resignation as president of Da-
vidson, many members of the
faculty and student body have
expressed their opinions about
the choice of a new president.
Here are a few samples of the
opinions of students and pro-
fessurs about the qualifications,
background, personality, and
views that the new president
should have:

Lovis Carrington: “The new
president ought not to be con-
nected with the college now,
and he should be a liberal who
will advocate radical changes
in our social and religious life.”

Professor A. B. Griffin: “A
college president sbould be an
efficient administrator and ex-
perienced educator, but we
can't ignore public relations for
an intelligent and effective in-
terpretation of the school’s
policies and needs.”

Doug Stewart: “The most
important qualification is that
the president should be a dedi-
cated Christian, not necessarily
a minister but preferably a

man with conservative policies.
I think he should come from
somewhere outside the college.

Charles Cook: “An educator,
of course, or a preacher.”

Dr. W. G. McGavock: “The
qualifications of prime import-
ance are a sound educational
background, an ability to pre-
sent Davidson’s cause to foun-
dations, industry, and individ.
uals to raise the necessary
funds, a lively interest in Chris-
tian education, and ithe desire
and ability to demand the re-
spect and friendship of the
faculty and students.”

Walter O’Briant: “The presi-
dent ought to be an administra-
tor and educator who will spend
his time building up the facul-
ty and will think that the best
trustees are those not heard
from and the best alumni those
dead.”

Or. George Watts: “I hope
we get a new president as good
as the one we just had.”

Ray Antley: “We ought to

have a young man who won't.

stay aloof from the students

and student activities.”

Professor Pedro Trakas: “We
need the unique type of per-
sonality that can meet the pub-
lic on all levels, since he will
have to know how to make the
contacts that will enable us to
maintain a good physical plant
to attract new students, ut
above everything else we need
an academician.”

Calvin McGehee: “The new
president shouldn’t be connect-
ed with Davidson now, but he
should be a Presbyterian.”

Bunny Perkinson: “He should
be a good educator first, not
necessarily a minister, or may-
be a combination of the two.”

Dr. Hal Ford: “Above all he
should be an educator and
someone who can look ahead
as well as to the past, in order
to meet the extraordinary pres-
sures on colleges that will
come in the next decade.”

Bobby Livingston: “We need
to get a person who doesn't
share the viewpoint that Da-
vidson is the best of all possi-
ble worlds.”

pleasant -thoughts comes a
slight touch of nostalgia be-
cause for some—it is the last
dance of the year — or for
others—the last dance of four
years. All these combine into
what I Ike best about Spring
Frolics.

2. I do not think that it is
necessary to have a “Big Name
Band” to make a weekend a
success. The success of the week-
end depends upon the weather,
the planned activities,.and of
course your date. However, I
will have to admit that the
dance weekend which I remem-
ber most vividly of all was
Spring Frolics of 1954 when
Ray Anthony was there.

MARSHA CAUDLE

Marsha Caudle, dating Gray
Lewis said:

1. I like the concerts on the
lawn, seeing the boys at the
dance with their white dinner
jackets, and playing ping pong
in the spring time at the fra-
ternity house.

2. I don’t think having a
“name band’ is necessary to
make the weekend a success,
but it. helps. Everyone knows
that at Spring Frolics they
usually have the biggest name
band of the year. And I fook
forward to hearing it.

JOYCE TAYLOR

Joyce Taylor, dating Dan
LaFar commented:

1. To me, Spring Frolics is
the Davidson campus—the dog-
wood, the green grass and the
sun-shine. The “on the lawn”
concert seems to climax this
spring time feeling, and I think
having the concert at 1:00 with
box luncheons would add a lot
to the afternoon.

2. A name band is always an
excellent drawing card and
creates a lot of pre-weekend
enthusiasm. However, good,
danceable music is the most
important thing.

JEANNE MARIE BRIGHT

Jeanne Marie Bright, dating.
Manfreid Emrich concluded:

1. Although everyone enjoys
the dances and the concert, I
have a particularly good time
at the parties after the dances.
Wearing bermudas, all can re-
lax and have loads of fun in
this less formal atmosphere.

2. I definitely do not think

that a “name band” is neces-

sary to make Spring Frolics a
success. A danceable band,
however, ts quite necessary.
When I am invited to a dance
I want to be able to dance gj

Dear Mother and Daddy,

serious test in the next few
years. More students will be
flooding the college campuses
than have in the past. A school
like Davidson will probably be
receiving more than twice as
many applications as it has in
past years.

This means that a greater
selectivity will be possible than
ever before (at the risk of re-
jecting the sons of some
angered alumni). Such selectiv-
ity must be practiced, however,
if Davidson is to keep the same
relative reputation that it now
holds.

The influx of such a more
intelligent student,- many of
whom will have to come on
scholarship aid to attract them
from ofher college offers, is
going to provide a more cosmo-
politan atmosphere in the stu-
dent body. Many of these men
will be coming from back-
grounds unfamiliar to the pres-
ent student generation and will
probably bring with them ec.
centricities to which we are un-
accustomed.

Such a student body is going
to be a real challenge to faculty
and student leaders alike. A
more rigorous curriculum will
have to be devised to challenge
the then “average” student’s

mind. Extra-curricular activi-
ties will become more diversi-
fied to accomodate their inter-
ests. Student leaders will have
to be more alert to meet the
arrival of interested students
who are more desirous of be-
ing good citizens.

The problem for Davidson is
to realize the challenge ahead
and prepare for it. Certainly
much work is already being
done with this idea in mind. In-
creasing the enrollment, how-
ever, is not necessarily part of
the answer. Curriculum plan-
ning, on the other hand, is most
definitely a step in the right di-
rection. :

Finally, it must not be for
gotten that Davidson now has
&@ good concept of education:
that of preparing in the liberal
arts tradition with a purpose-
ful concept of education leaders
who are aware of their Chris-
tian heritage. All this takes
place on a small campus where
a friendly attitude prevails.

These things should be kept,
but should be tempered by a
more inquiring atmosphere
with a more cosmopolitan stu-
dent body. All problems that
come before the college in the
next few years should be con-
sidered in the light of these
developments.
