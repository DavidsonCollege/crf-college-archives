Flickerball results defy prophecies

By KIRK COMBE
and TOMMY BLACKWOOD

_ As the mellow .,Carolinas
become more deeply embedded
into the passions of autumn, it
is increasingly evident that

there is really no pattern to
flickerball, save the one which
seems to have haunted the
hollows and fields of play as

That is, the better teams
win, the weaker teams get
hurt and all others a nebulous
masses floating in between.

Two such gaseous forms
met in sub-mediocre combat in
the guise of Emanon and
ATO. :

With absolutely no idea of
what they were doing, these
two armies fought it out on a
darkling plane only to find
Emanon victorious 33-7 by no
virtue of their own. ATO is
pitiful, but proud.

A hanger

It was a hanger as on
another part of the fields of
honor the Gnads_ snubbed
PDT #2 (all those who weren’t
good enough for PDT #1) by a
31-12 margin. The Gnads dis-
played (or exposed) a superior
ball handling ability, as well
as a jock-strap-tight defense.
They repeatedly sacked the
opposing quarterback.

The Gnads show promise of
great things to come. They
hang together and work well
as a team. ‘heir common and
driving goal is to score. And

this seems to be their strong- :

est advantage, they are loose.

In an euthanasia match
played in the amphitheater of
field #1 (and rained on from
above by the soccer balls of
the N. C. State match), KA #1
did indescribable things to a

team of transfer students
(stop a second and try to
imagine that) called Nazgut.
The KA traditionally looked
good. Their flowing, but by no
means out-of-place, hair and
tinsel jerseys left the flicker-
mindless Nazgut stunned,
47-0.

‘Parking fine’ Ed

Ed Willingham led _ the
Southerners (what an awful
objective) and personally dist-
ributed increased parking
fines to the losers. The KA’s
were cheered on by two bus
loads of Salem and Queens
things (girls?}. Aren’t our
coeds good enough? (Sorry, we
lost our heads for a moment.)

The following afternoon
Nazgut continued their what-
ever ways by losing to Cannon
II. This they’ accomplished
despite the fact that there was
no reported score of the game
nor any refs present. These
transfers are amazing indeed.
Cannon II, on a stroke of
originality, calls themselves
the Cannon Balls. Cute but
inappropriate. Art Leahy was
unable to play because he was
in study hall.

In another poorly documen-
ted game it seems that 4th
Richardson defeated Dingo
32-26.

There is, however, a rather
large question mark on the

Union sponsors name contest

The Coffeehouse Committee of the College Union is
sponsoring a contest to come up with a name for the

‘ We would prefer a name that would be distinctive,
printable, and bring to mind the concept of the
listening room; a room to present the performing arts in
an ideal blend of sound, light, an attentive audience.
Please submit all entries, unlimited, to the infor-
mation desk of the College Union by Monday, October

A prize is to be awarded for the winning entry: one
pair of Homecoming Concert tickets to see the Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band and John Hartford.

scorecard, a couple of names
crossed off the space provided
for officials and a torn but
taped together card attached
to the back of the first card
declaring Dingo the winner
12-7.

More mystery reigns in
IMAC Central. Commissioner
Bowie claims this matter will
be thoroughly investigated
and cleared up within the
week. But nobody really cares.

The last contest of the last
day of September saw PDT
“C” (all those who weren’t
good enough for PDT ‘2”’)
beating Chocolate Speedway
by a deceptionally boring
score of 39-27. Even the role
quoting of Brian ‘Bowie’
Andrews could not avert the
inevitable. The atmosphere is
sullen in IMAC Central.

Joe Banana

The first day of October saw
Joe Banana and his Bunch
float to an impressive victory
over Etc. in a_ previously
rained-out match. With a
high-flying defensive back-
field, the men of Etc. seemed
unable to pass to anyone but
that mysterious blond defen-
der (who strongly resembles
Bjorn Borg) for Joe Banana.

Interception after intercep-
tion produced score after score
as Etc. romped, 51-12. The
game ball was awarded to
George Loy because everyone
felt sorry for him.

Eric ‘“‘Maddog”’ Hendrix al-
so made a fool of himself. The
sophomore team called the
Whiz Kids were also victorious
that day, defeating the fresh-
man team of 3rd Richardson,
38-7. That shows what =
difference a year aioe meat
be next season 3rd Richardson
will have developed the motor
coordination to write legibly
on their roster sheet.

Another experienced team,
aptly named Ragmen, under-
cut more freshman dreams
this time whipping those of 1st
Richardson by an embarras-
sing score of 47-3. All we want
to know is how 1st Richardson

‘got three points. We thought

all Davidson football teams
opted to go for it on fourth and
eighth.

The dying gasps of the
Gozinya dynasty of quality
athletes was heard as a team
called Off Again pounded the
emaciated remnants of what
once was by 25-7. The cry of
“Gozinya’’ seems grossly in-
adequate from this year’s pal-
