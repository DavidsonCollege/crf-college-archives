DAVIDSON TO COMPETE IN
INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATES

Mercer to be Met at Macon, Ran-
dolph-Macon at Ashland, and
Dickinson at Greensboro.

In addition to the debates with
Mercer and Randolph-Macon Col-
lege, a third one has recently been
arranged with Dickinson College, of
Pennsylvania. This debate will be

held at Greensboro on May 11. Da-

vidson will be represented by R. T.
Liston and L. B. Schenck, with W.
B. Sullivan as alternate. They will
uphold the negative side of the ques-
tion, Resolved, “That the United
States should adopt some form of
Universal Military Training.” -

D. M. Chalmers and A. P. Ormond
with J. C. McCaskill as alternate,
will debate with Mercer at Macon
on May 4. They will debate the
affirmative side of the same ques-
tion. A. M. Mitchell and C.
Brown with G. M. Dunlap as alter-
nate, will uphold the affirmative of
the same question against Ran-
dolph-Macon at Ashland, Va., on
May If.

The debaters have moved a great
part of the library to the Phi hall
and are spending much time prepar-
ing to “mop up.” Interesting con-
tests are expected with all three in-
stitutions.

POLITY CLUB MEETS.

Name Changed to D. C. ter of
international Rocio Chak,
Officers Elected.

Thirteen menfbers were present
at the last regular meeting of the
Polity Club. Two excellent speeches
marked the occasion. Fricker gave
a very instructive discourse on Tur-
key, showing the recent history and
disposition of the Ottoman Empire
by the League of Nations. S. A.
Askew followed with an interesting
resume of current events touching
upon every phase from Senator

ewberry to the railroad strike, and
from the Interchurch Movement to
the Mary Pickford case.

The secretary next read to the
club a new constitution prepared
with much labor and diligence by
the faithful president, L. P. Good,
and some other prominent members.
The name of the club was changed
to the International Relations Club.
This constitution also provides for
stricter rules as to the election of
new members, together with drastic
means of decreasing the number of
absentees. Those men who“are in-
terested in the club are urged to at-
tend the meetings lest haply they
should soon find themselves no long-
er members. This constitution was
unanimously adopted.

In the annual election of officers,
the following men were chosen to
direct the club during the coming
year: President, F. V. Long, vice-
president, C. K. Brown; secretary-

le SaaS treasurer, A. F. Fricker.

OFFICERS FOR NEXT YEAR

At a meeting of the Junior class
the important and difficult task of
getting out next year’s Annual was
given to C. H. Long. As his part-
ner and business manager he has C.
M. McCaskill. Both these men have
worked hard on this year’s Quips
and Cranks and well deserve the
honor.

LAST LYCEUM ENTERTAIN-
MENT OF YEAR IS HELD

Opie Reid, the famous American
Author, Gives Highly Interest-
ing er Sketch.

The last number of this year’s
Lyceum was conducted by Opie Reid
in a humorous lecture on’a country-
man’s impressions of New York
City. He described a number of
amusing experiences with “gold
bricks,” pickpockets, cabarets, sky-
scrapers, courts, factories, and oth-
er things. “It’s just as wicked to
crook a thief,” says Mr. Reid, “as it
is an honest man.” Again, he said,
“Some people take great pleasure in
working and are at it all the time,
but I believe in self-restraint.”

His address was not by any means_

entirely humorous. He paid a splen-
did tribute to Woodrow Wilson.

Again, he made a scathing denun-’

ciation of the heartless profiteers
who own the sweat shops. He also
ridiculed the modern cheap books,
and praised the classical ones. “Wis-
dom,” he said, “is not measured in
dryness.” “Nature creates in her
cheerful moods.” “Prayer,” he
said again, “is the humility from
which comes strength.” He also dis-
cussed the evil of riches. Altogeth-
er, his address, with its mingled
pathose and humor, throwing his
audience alternately into tears of
sympathy or into the most boister-
ous laughter, was one of the finest
ever heard here.

K.| REUNION CLASSES WILL
MAKE M

ERRY
AT COMMENCEMENT
Class Banquete—Alumni Feed.

This is the year specially desig-
nated for reunion of the classes of
1915, 1910, 1905, 1900, 1895, 1890,
1885, 1880 and so on every fifth year
back.

Of course every alumnus that can
possibly get back to the campus will
find a cordial welcome and a good
time awaiting him and is urged to
come, but members of the class
mentioned above will be honor
guests. They should be here in
large delegations and with an exu-
berance of class and college spirit.
Class yells and college songs on the
part of the “reuning” classes will
again be a conspicuous and enjoy-
able part of Commencement.

Talk it up, fellows; the time is
limited. Commencement ends May
26th. The Alumni Luncheon will be
held as usual. In addition to this
some classes will doubtless wish to
have a banquet dinner. College offi-
cials will be glad to assist in making
necessary arrangements.

Every man that is planning to
come back to the hill is requested to
write his classmates to meet him
here. Let’s have the biggest and
best commencement yet!

Dr. Martin, president of the col-
lege, attended the sessions of Con-
cord Presbytery in the interests of
the college.

“Doug” Elliot, ex-’20, of the
famous Wildcats of '17, spent a
short while with friends on the
“Hill” last week.

If there are many more games of
baseball on the front campus the re-
sult will not be pleasant to con-
template.

Mrs. Ida Davis and her sister,
Mrs. Stinson, were recent visitors
at the home of Mrs. Barnes.

ness and a prerequisite of Christian
;service. Aside from the associa-
tions at Blue Ridge, aside from the
lectures and conferences, aside from
the inspiring surroundings, Blue
Ridge is worth while for any col-
lege student because it gives him a
chance to take stock and open a new
set of books with higher aspirations
and loftier purposes.

The Platform Talks Highly Inter-

addresses rank first. There are two
lof these during the day, one in the
morning and one, in the evening.
The beauty about them is that they
are not dry lectures but straightfor-
ward, heart-to-heart talks that hold
your interest every moment of the
time. The men on the program for
these addresses are among the fore-
most leaders in the south. They are
men, too, who know college boys
and are interested in their problems.
And knowing college men, they
speak on subjects that college men
are interested in and subjects vital
in the life of every man.

There will in all probability be

many changes in the Blue Ridge
program, but there are certain out-

Student Secretary of the Y. M. C.
A., President of the Y. M. C. A. Sec-
retaries’ College at Nashville, and
founder of Blue Ridge, will be in
charge of the conference.

Among the other speakers of last
year who are expected to return are
Dr. Sweets, of the Southern Pres-
byterian Church ; Dr. Mims and Pro-
fessor Trawick, of Vanderbilt; Dr.
Winfield Scott Hall, Dr. J. A. Po-
teat, Dr. Kesler, Mr. Fred Rindge,
of the Industrial Department of the
Y. M. C. A.; Dean Brown, of Yale;

Mr. J. Lovell Murray, and Robt. E. -
Speer. It has been said that Wood-
row Wilson, John R. Mott and Robt.
E. Speer are the greatest men in the
world. Certainly it is the chance of
a lifetime to hear Dr. Speer. To
hear any one of these speakers
would amply repay for the trip to
Blue Ridge.
And the Dining Hall Has Its Usual
Attractiveness

The President of the Davidson
student body who was at Blue Ridge
last summer, said that Blue Ridge
had something that was more like
Davidson spirit than any place he
had been to, and that is the senti-
ment of the other 15 men who rep-
