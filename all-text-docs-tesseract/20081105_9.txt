Though the results of the electoral college may suggest
otherwise, last night’s race was actually close on a
national scale. As The Davidsonian went to press,
Obama held a 52-47 lead in the popular vote. The vote
at Davidson, however, was slightly more skewed. Of
decided voters, nearly 70% reported that they planned
to vote for Obama. In 2004, 64% of students went for

John Kerry over Bush. Obama McCain

The Other Races

Democrats also made significant gains on the legislative side—as we
went to press, they appeared likely to pick up six or seven seats in the
Senate and 20-30 seats in the House. In North Carolina, Kay Hagan
defeated Republican incumbent Elizabeth Dole for a Senate seat,
while Democrat Bev Perdue beat out Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory
in the gubernatorial race. In Davidson’s 12th Congressional District,
incumbent Mel Watt cruised to an easy victory. Nearby, Larry Kissel
unseated Republican Robin Hayes in the Eighth District. The Senate
race in Georgia between Saxby Chambliss and Democratic challenger
Jim Martin remained undecided.

Barack Obama cruised to victory in
the electoral college, winning several
states that had not voted for a Democrat
in some time. Virginia and Indiana, for
instance, have voted for a Republican
in every election since 1964.
