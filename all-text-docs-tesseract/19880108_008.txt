Two more senior leaders

By BILL SMITH

Two seniors, Dean Keener and
Mike Gynn, will need to contrib-
ute heavily if Davidson’s string of
twenty-win seasons is to continue.
Each played important roles last
year and more is expected from’
them this séason.

Dean, an Economics major,
plays the number two guard and
can run the offense when neces-
sary. Last year, playing as a top
reserve, Dean often came into a
game and provided the spark
Davidson needed to win.

-Examples of his contributions
from last year include wins

Dean Keener
against Furman and Western
Carolina.

His role this year is to comple-
ment Derek Rucker when oppos-
ing defenses key on him, touncork
his dangerous perimeter shot, and
to be a senior leader on and off the
court.

Starting periodically, Dean
mentioned that the transition from
reserve to starter. demands a dif-

ferent approach in his game.

He commented that last year he
could “get a feel for the game”
while sitting and provide “more of
a spark” coming off the bench.
But when starting, he has “to be
ready from the start” and contrib-
ute immediately.

Whether starting or playing off
the bench, Dean can help the of-
fense with his shooting touch.

Being the “basketball junkie”
as Coach Hussey describes him,
Dean recognizes that he must
improve his defensive pressure by
conference play if he is to limit
guards such as Skip Henderson of
Marshall--the preseason favorite
to the MVP trophy for the confer-
ence.

Coming off the bench is 6-8
forward Mike Gynn. Mike, a
Political;Science major, hopes to
be the spark that could ignite
Davidson to several triumphs in
this his final year. In last year’s
twenty-win season, Mike played
in twenty-nine of the thirty-one
games and was a key player in
many of the Conference games.

Both Mike and Coach Hussey
indicated that his role this year
will be to provide more inside
scoring and strong rebounding of
the boards.

Unfortunately, Mike was in-

. jured all preseason with stress

fractures in both legs due to his
training and practice in the sum-

mer months. Mike says that he has
“slowly gotten back into practice”
and now is ready and “at 100%.”

. The areas Mike listed that he
thought needed more work were
his back-to-the-basket moves as
well as his footwork. Also, he
commented that his rebounding
efforts needed to be more consis-

_ tent as well as aggressive.

Coach Hussey’s remarks were
that both Dean and Mike are fine
examples of senior leaders, As
seniors, they know they can go out
with an overall winning record
and Coach Hussey said both of
them are playing hard to assure

Mike Gynn

that record. Their attitudes have
been very good, thus they are a
great influence to the younger
players on the squad.

Dean and Mike say this year’s

- team chemistry is special and that

once all the players “gel” to-
gether, Davidson will be a good
basketball team.

All I know about college bas-
ketball is tainted by my past. 1
grew up as a Kentucky fan in the
seventies. One thing I learned was
how to deal with the polls.

For college basketball, the
weekly wire service polls are of-
ten a weak measurement of ac-
complishment for teams when the
true test of the tournament in
March is still far in the distance.
You may or may not know how
your team will do in the NCAA’s,
but you do know what they are
currently ranked. Rankings also
serve to alert people to teams they
may not have previously consid-
ered. For instance, people in
California would know little of
Marshall if not for the fact that one
magazine chose them in their top
twenty.

All of this is good for the game.
My complaint with the pollsis that
too often a team is judged by its
most recent and most publicized
games. My preface about Ken-
tucky leads me to this.

I can recall the final day of the
1977 season when an undefeated
and top ranked San Francisco
team was playing at Notre Dame.
Meanwhile, number two Ken-
tucky was playing Tennessee. I
watched as Notre Dame used their
home court advantage to its fullest
by beating USF by two. I knew
that Kentucky would only have to
beat Tennessee to move up to first.
It did not matter that USF hadn’t
lost a game before Notre Dame,
nor did it matter that Notre Dame

_is famous for knocking off pre-

mierteamsin its Atheletic Convo-
cation Center. The fact was that
USF had lostand done it in frontof
Billy Packer and NBC. That was
enough to. disqualify them from
being number one.

If you follow college hoops,
you may have noticed that Ari-

zona was bumped from #1 this

week by Kentucky. In fact, Ari-
zona was even passed by Pitt on
their fall down to third place. All
this because they dropped a two
point game to New Mexico in the
“pit” in Albuquerque Saturday
night on ESPN. The Wildcats, a
team that had been shooting in the
upper 50% range, shot only 38%
from the floor in what obviously
was an off night. Potential All-
American guard Steve Kerr was 3
of 10 from three pointrange where
he averages 61%. Thus Arizona
fell to a New Mexico team that
could actually be one of the best in
the west this year.

Before their loss, Arizona had

beaten Syracuse, Michigan, Iowa,
and Duke - four top ten teams.

‘Their replacements in the top

spots, Kentucky and Pitt have
beaten a combined three top
twenty teams. However, these
three wins were all nationally tele-
vised... In fact national TV. can
often be a determining factor in
the polls.

But it is the “what have you
done for me lately” attitude that
ultimately cripples the wire serv-
ice polls as a means of judging
teams. Just as in college football,
the basketball polls consider a
late-season loss much more ‘in-
criminating than an early season
loss. This helps out teams such as
Louisville and UNLV who play
tougher December schedules to
prepare for a weak conference
slate. On the other hand, a team in
the Big Ten or Big East would
tend to be undervalued in the
March rankings due to the rigors
of road play in a tough league.

Fortunately, college basketball
doesn’t suffer from the lack of a
national championship that hin-
ders college football. Therefore,
the polls mean little except for the
fans whose bragging rights are at
stake. Yet they are the only scale ©
on which to judge teams until
March comes. And the fact of the
matter is that the rankings are best
used by friends who debate among
themselves, not really to judge
who the best teams are.

STRATEGY, from page 7

they’ve lost, lost as many as
they’ve won. This kind of per-
formance won’t be sufficient to
put Davidson in a position to win
the conference tournament, much
less to garner a third 20-win sea-
son in a row.

Maybe these aren’t the only two
options. If the other coach is
stupid, has seen no Davidson
films, and knows nothing of
Rucker’s talents, then maybe he
will refuse to use a freak defense.
But few Division I coaches have
this outlook. Any coach who
realizes the situation here will
want to stop Rucker first -- they
think, “As Rucker goes, so goes
Davidson.”

Thus far, they’ve been right
most of the time.

Let’s hope Coach Hussey and
the “Cats can prove them wrong.

- Until they do, in the words of

Whodini, “Freaks. are all over
them like white on rice.”
