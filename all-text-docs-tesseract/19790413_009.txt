To play Varsity baseball, as
well as football for freshman
and sophomore years, while
being married and maintaining
a 3.82 GPA in the Pre-Med
program might seem an impos-
sibility. Such an impossibility
has not stopped sophomore
ohn Porter, who got married
ast summer, played football
last fall and now starts in
enterfield for the Wildcats
Baseball team.

Last weekend in a double-
header loss to James Madison
University (losing by scores of
16-2 and 5-3), Porter led the
ats with a brilliant perfor-
mance at the plate; he got four
hits in five times at bat. One hit
was a clutch double that scored
two runs.

THE BASEBALL team will be playing at home this Saturday at 1: 00 dgainat Furman.

As lead-off hitter for the
team, Porter touts a strong .345
batting average that demon-
strates his consistency in get-
ting on base. Once on base, his
lightning speed aids him in
base-stealing, (he leads the
team with five), and in scoring
runs, where he also leads the
team with thirteen.

While playing defense, Por-
ter’s speed allows him to range
throughout the outfield. Last
year Porter alternated at short-
stop. With the departure of last
year’s outstanding centerfield-

-er, Stan Brown, Coach Palmer

Muench moved Porter to cen-
terfield where his speed can
best be utilized.

In the Madison doublehead-
er, Porter so impressed the Ma-
dison coach that he was asked

utfielder handles athletics, marriage, and premed major

to play in the Valley League in
Virginia this summer.

With the combination of good
speed, solid fielding and strong
hitting, John Porter will defi-
nitely be considered by pro
scouts over the next two years.
This may create an important
decision for him since he desires
to study medicine. At present
his 3.82 GPA makes is almost a
certainty that he will get into
medical school.

Two of the All-American
dreams lie before him: to play
pro baseball and to be a physi-
cian. Which will John Porter
choose? “I'd like to try to do
both,” he commented. And why
shouldn't he try? So far nothing
has stopped him from being a
great success at Davidson both
academically and athletically.

opponents in the next it:
there is one word to describe the

general attitude of the team, it
would have to be “‘prepared.””

Thanks to those windsprints _

and Hopman drills, the Wild-
cats are in the best shape this

“season. In fact, Jeff Lyle feels

that this year’s team is physi-
cally the best conditioned in his
three years as a Varsity tennis
player.

More importantly, the Cats
are mentally prepared for the
upcoming matches. At this
point, they stand with 17 wins
and 6 losses and are psychologi-
cally confident. Last week’s
loss to Appalachian State gave
the squad a taste of what they

mendable win over his fifth
singles opponent in the match
against the Mountaineers.

In other action last week, the
Davidson squad edged Guilford
5-4 ina match held in Greens-
boro. Harry Griffith, Gil Kay-
ton, and Lyle won their singles
matches. The Cats shut out
Western Carolina (9-0) in a
one-sided match last Saturday.

This coming Tuesday, the
team: faces Furman at 2:00 on
the home courts. The Cats are
prepared; they are psyched.
This match could prove to be
the best tennis of the season.

Davidson’s women’s tennis

team heads into the final week
of the regular season with a 9-5
record and high hopes for the
state division tournament at
Davidson beginning Thursday,
April 19. Despite an 8-1 loss to

tough N.C. State Tuesday,

coach Pat Miller maintains that
the team is looking strong.

Top players Emmy Knobloch
and Hope McArn have been

playing very well, with McArn -

going undefeated in her last five
matches including the only
Davidson victory on Tuesday.
Knobloch has won four of her

last five matches.
Miller says the team will be

- especially strong in singles in

the tournament, probably ta-
king the first or second seeds in
flights one, two, three, and six,
along with high seeds in doubles

The winner of the tournament
goes to the regionals at William
and Mary, where Davidson
finished fourth last year. Before
the tournament, however, the
team will play three more
regular season matches—
against UNCC and Converse
here (Thursday and Monday),
and at Furman on Tuesday.

The beginning of the major league
baseball season, as much as anything,
signifies to Americans the start of
spring. It’s always a fresh start for all
the ballclubs, and optimism and enthu-
siasm radiate from each camp.

No one more than the managers
radiates this optimism that comes from
a winter in the sun and possibly an
encouraging Grapefruit League show-
ing. It’s these quirksome managers,

- many having just gone through base-
ball’s annual winter revolving door,
that add so much to the game.

These men have over the years given
baseball much of its color as they work
with the intricate strategies of the
game. Also, the long and demanding
seasons they have experienced have

resulted in.considerable aberrant beha- ~

vior and played up many a demented
personality.

Billy Martin is probably the best
known and most notorious of managers
in our time. He has been through the
revolving door many times, not be-
cause of any lack of success, but rather
because his personality isn’t com-
patible with nearly anyone’s.

. Asa strategist, though, he is among
the best. But sometimes his actions are

he once ordered one of his pitchers
who was replacing another in the early
innings of a game the Tigers were
trailing, to keep warming up on the
mound and not signal to the umpire
that he was ready. Martin had detected
rain clouds on the horizon and consi-
dered it best not to continue to play,
and let the game be rained out.

Unfortunately for Billy, after nearly
two hours it seemed the clouds had
passed; he gave up and had his pitcher
inform the umpire he was ready to go.

Once, in another clearly erratic
move, Martin, upon seeing that the
umpires wouldn’t do anything to
prevent. Gaylord Perry from throwing
what Martin thought were spitballs to
his players, ordered his own Joe
Coleman to throw spitters to Cleve-
land. Coleman not having any idea how
to throw them, was very wild trying.
The game became quite farcical and
Martin was fined heavily.

Martin is of course, also known for
his combative nature. While with
Texas he once sent out his whole squad
wielding baseball bats to protect his
rightfielder from some unruly fans.
Needless to say, mayhem followed.

Perhaps no manager can match
Martin’s feisty manner, but Frank
Robinson, formerly of Cleveland,
comes pretty close. Robinson didn’t
confine his actions to fighting oppo-
nents either. He once battled his own
Rico Carty in the Indian dugout in the
middle of a game. Also, in an exhibi-
tion game with Cleveland’s AAA club,

pitchers who apparently had been too
aggressive in tagging Frank out at

’ third. That pitcher was never brought

up to the majors. eee
On the other end of the specturm is

the Dodger’s Walter Alston. He never

changed expression in the dugout, and

he sometimes appeared asleep. In fact,

it was said Casey Stengel often did fall
asleep in the Mets’ dugout as his team
would be suffering through yet another
drubbing at the hands of a far superior
opponent.

Alvin Dark, while with Oakland, was
also known as a rather passive sort.
After dedicating his life to Jesus, he

felt it un-Christian to give any criticism -

to his players. This got so extreme that
even Reggie Jackson was heard to
complain about it.

Dark was also a master tactician,
often placing Sam McDowell (while
with Cleveland) on second base so he
could keep him in the. game to face a
left-handed hitter later. In Oakland he
was also prone to juggling with the
second base position. He often used as
many as four second basemen in a

Notwithstanding their strategic
prowess, managers are perhaps better
known for being somewhat deficient
intellectually. Many baseball
would probably cite Ralph Houk as a
prime example. Once, upon being
confronted with the idea that baseball
managers weren’t considered too intel-
ligent, Houk countered by saying, ‘‘We
might not do well on a knowledge test,

but we’d do pretty good on a tat on

baseball.’’ Profound! ‘

Don Zimmer of Boston hasn’t always
been considered among the brightest in
his baseball days either. He has an
excuse, though. He has enough steel
plates in his head (placed there after
getting plunked by fast-balls in his
head during his playing days) to
prevent him from getting past airport
metal detectors.

Intelligence doesn’t seem to afftect
performance, however. _Zimmer and
Houk have both had success. Also, .
Earl Weaver and Sparky Anderson
have had tremendous success as mana-
gers; but to my knowledge neither has

‘ been awarded any honorary degrees.

Perhaps the most universal charac-
teristic managers have is that they're
hated. Eddie Stankey, for example,
formerly of the White Sox, was hated
everywhere. Boston fans used to
he’d show his face in town.

Most managers are even well-hated
in their home town, where. they are
ususally greeted with cascades of boos.
Some don’t care (after all, nice guys
finish last). But most go through the |
agony of public scrutiny and eventual
firing many times in their careers.

It is pretty much true that the' same
old crop of managers returns year after
year, often with a new team, always a
little bit crazier with one more long
season and sometimes another firing
under their belt. As a result, this year
one can again count on the fact that .
insanity will emanate from major
league dugouts nationwide.
