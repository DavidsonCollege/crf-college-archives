New health advisors « on making good choices

By GEORGIEAHRENDT
Health Advisor

Sometimes the weekend rituals of the
Davidson College student resemble a
Discovery Channel nature documentary.

On occasion, we to act as though we’re
being driven by pure animal instinct. Our
mating rituals, for example, often lack a cer-
tain amount
of sophisti-
cation (like
the sloppy }
snogging
w e
euphemisti-
cally refer
to as “the
drunken
hook-up”).
However,
what many
of us seem
to forget is
that, unlike
the animals
on the
Discovery
Channel
who

who are here to help. The counseling center,
First Responders and the student Health
Advisors are just a few.

But while Davidson provides a great sup-
port system, we can’t stress enough how
important it is to take personal responsibility
for your health, both physical and mental, in
your every day life. No one but you can
make sure you get enough sleep, or eat a bal-

the average college student, we do have, for
better or for worse, the power of choice.

. Hooking up while drunk doesn’t by any
means make you an animal. My point is sim-
ply that putting yourself in charge of your
body means respecting yourself and others.

Our health and personal well-being rely on
the fact that we must make good choices for
ourselves and for our bodies. Here at
Davidson, we don’t always have to make
these often daunting and stressful choices
alone. There are so many people on campus

anced diet, or practice safe sex.

And your obligation to yourself to make
healthy choices extends farther than you
might think. You have to create for yourself
a healthy environment, and it’s one that
might stretch beyond your own personal
sphere.

For instance, if you are a female and sexu-
ally active, it’s important to know that con-
doms are your business, too. It’s your
responsibility to make sure your partner is
using it correctly. Condoms protect the both

of you. Also, if you see a friend getting in a
dangerous situation— perhaps they’re drink-
ing excessively or being too sexually aggres-
sive with someone—you’re not doing your-
self any favors by pretending it’s not happen-
ing.

Healthy minds and bodies flourish in
healthy communities— ones that are built on
respect.

It’s our, the Health Advisors’, hope that
Davidson can continue to keep up an open
and honest dialogue about health issues. We
can’t build a better Davidson if we all pent-
up our frustrations, questions and curiosities.

‘It’s important to remember you’re never
alone. Chances are there is someone who is
just as confused as you are about something

or has shared a similat experience. Even if
you feel like living at Davidson is like tuning
in to the Discovery Channel, remember there
are ways to make sense of what goes on
around you.

So don’t change the channel just yet.
Believe us; your health is worth it.
