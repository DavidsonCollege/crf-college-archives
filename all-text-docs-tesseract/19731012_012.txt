ROTC Participation Declines
| As Only 31 Freshmen Enroll

LILLIAN GASCOIGNE
Asst. Managing Editor

Thirty-one Davidson College
freshmen, including six women,
will be participating in the Ar-
my Reserve Officers Training
Corps this year. This is a sub-
stantial decrease from last
year’s 87 students who began
the program and the 45 who
finished.

“The ending of the draft and
the war in Vietnam influenced
these numbers quite a bit. We
are now trying to break away
from the old concept of the ar-
my in connection with Vietnam.
The army is now, more than
ever, a way of life, and a most
enjoyable one, with a lot to of-
fer.’’ stated Colonel William
Simpson, the new head of the
ROTC program here.

“Freshmen can still sign up
for the program, and we will
catch them up on through Oc-
tober. There is no obligation
and no credit for this course.”’

Cross-enrollment students
from other schools _par-
ticipating in ROTC at David-
son, is a new feature this year.
The 16 students in this program
come from Johnson C. Smith,
UNC-C, Belmont Abbey College
and Gaston College.

Many scholarships now
enhance the ROTC program.
Nine freshmen are on four year
scholarships. These are also
available on one, two and three
year terms and are renewed
each year as long as the student

“Yearbook “Arrival Finally Set

(Continued from page 1)
“The book was largely Ron’s
art, and he didn’t seek much
help,"’ George and other staff
members stated.
“It is the editor’s job to see
that all deadlines are met, and

in this capacity last year’s
editor failed,” another staff
member complained.

Another problem over which
no staff member had control
concerned the resignation of the
yearbooks company’s represen-
tative to Davidson.

“This caused many com-
munication problems,’’ said
George, “‘and we may not use
the same printer for the '74 an-
nual.”’

There have also been some
communication problems
among the school’s financial
committees, the annual staff,
and the student body con-
cerning annual staff elections
and budgets.

Elections for positions on the
annual staff are held in
February of each year. The
Student Body Financial Com-
mittee does not meet until May
of each year.

‘“‘A situation could arise, and
has arisen before, where a
student is elected on a large
budget. He then makes plans
and orders based on that budget
and runs the risk of having his
budget cut out from under him
when the financial committee
meets.

“What is he to do?”
Currie.

Several people around cam-
pus say they have solutions.

Terry suggests that alter-
ations to the content of the
student handbook and yearbook
be made.

“Let a section of the hand-
book contain everybody's pic-
ture, faculty and staff included.
Students could use it as a direc-
tory.

‘Retain the annual, but let it
be a book of pictures about

asks

Davidson life - a sort of guide to
Davidson,’’ offered Terry.

According to the American
Yearbook Company, one of the
main hold-ups in printing was
“the delay in receiving the
photographs for the 1973 David-

son annual.”’

Two other members of the
college staff agree that com-
mittees should be formed im-
mediately to study the annual
and its.problems.

‘‘We need to stimulate more
discussion on campus about the
annual,’’ said Assistant Alumni
Director Zach Long.

‘“‘Has anyone ever thought to

ask what another school of 1100
students is paying for an annual
so we can make some com-
parisons?’’ asked Currie.

‘‘We need more campus
discussion concerning the an-
nual so arbitrary decisions con-
cerning the budget won't be
made.”

The budget for the 1974 an-
nual will be about $9500 (or $8.63
per student). This figure
represents a $1500 increase over
the 1973 annual’s budget.

Only those people who at-
tended Davidson last year will
receive the 1973 annual, when it
arrives in November.

... Christian Service

(Continued from page 1)

The Joint Committees last
met Sept. 7 at which meeting
they discussed campus and
community worship. A
program of Tuesday evening
worship services was
established, largely the work of
Minister Otey.

“This Tuesday service will
hopefully be one place each
week where town, gown, black,
white, rich, poor, sad and hap-
py people may come together to
seek to overcome those things
which separate us and to
celebrate that which binds us
together,’’ Otey said.

He indicated that this attempt
to bring together students and
townspeople will probably not
be very successful in terms of
numbers, but that even if just a
few are broght together it will

have been worthwhile.

If the Tuesday worship ser-
vice represents a new expres-
sion of Davidson's Christian
commitment, so does Otey him-
self.

“Otey, who began work this
summer, is the first chaplain
Davidson has had since Scott
Woodmansee, departed in
December of 1971.

Unlike Woodmansee, Otey
has connections with both the
college and the Presbyterian
Church on campus. “I’m aware
that there are possibilities of
role conflict” Otey said, ‘‘and
I’m sensitive to this.

‘What I hope to do is to main-
tain autonomy while drawing
both college and non-college
people. It is true, though, that
some students might see me as

being too related to one
church.”

maintains a C average and
meets ROTC proficiency stan-
dards. Students may apply for
these scholarships through the
ROTC offices.

Also, those staying in ROTC
more than two years receive
$100 a month and are com-
missioned second lieutenants
when they graduate. Thear-
my is now offering full medical
scholarship programs which
pay tuition and all other fees
plus $400 a month spending
money.

While there are now no
scholarships for law students,
the army offers a program for
active duty in army law offices
during the summer. The
student will act as a second
lieutenant and will receive the
pay for that office.

There are also graduate
school fellowships for those
planning to stay in service with
the regular army. Again, in-

terested students may apply
through the ROTC offices here.

The program has not been
altered in arly way by the ad-
dition of women. However, they
are not permitted to drill with
combat arms.

The freshman ROTC course is
a light introduction consisting
of 30 classroom hours which
places emphasis on military
history and includes the basics
of map reading, tactics, work in
the squad and platoon level and
communications.

In addition to ROTC is the
ROCS (Ranger Oriented Com-
bat Soldiers) Program,
designed for the ‘highly
motivated cadets who enjoy
rugged outdoor life and want
more.”’ The program, designed
by the students, consists mainly
of challenging tactical exer-
cises which are carried out over
weekends. Simpson termed this
program ‘‘adventure training.”’

He said that he has con-
fidence in the contractor and his
skill at meeting and solving
such problems.

On the subject of cost

“normal’’ price increases have
been encountered.
