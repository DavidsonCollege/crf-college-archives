TENNIS “FOURNAMENT
SCHEDULED FOR THIS WEEK

The tennis tournament for the spring
term will begin this week. Because of
the failure of “TV. W. Hawkins, ex-'18,
the fall champion, to return to college
after the holidays, the student body’ has
been without a championship team since
Christmas, A number of teams have
entered the tournament, and the pros
pects indicate that it will be more close-
lv contested than last fall. Manager
Hall plans to run the singles and
‘doubles alternately, saving time in. this
way as well as adding interest to. the
tournament. ‘The tournament will prob-
ably rin well into next week, with the
grand finals coming about Wednesday or
Thursday. :
