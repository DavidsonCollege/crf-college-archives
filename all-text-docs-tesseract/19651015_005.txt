Adams Tapes Pros
For Charlotte Tilts

By BILL BRIGGS
Davidsonian Sports Editor

Leaning back against the fiberglass seats under
the shade of the new press box, student trainer John
Adams began recounting his tales of acting as trainer
for the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and Baltimore
Bullets, Friday and Saturday. -

“Paul Buck (manager of the Charlotte Coliseum).
called Tom Couch last week,” Adams began, “and
asked him to be trainer for the Bullets and 76ers for
the weekend. Couch couldn't do it, but he said he'd
send in one of his boys. He sent me.”

Adams scratched his head and laughed, “He
didn’t know he would have gotten $80 for going.
Boy, is he mad now.”

The Boston Celtics and St. Louis Hawks, who
brought their own trainers, lined up against the
76ers and Bullets, respectively, in Friday's double-
header. However, they both lost to Adams’ boys,
and the second night's doubleheader pitted the two
teams he was training against each other/in the
winners’ bracket.

MIXED EMOTIONS

“I sort of had mixed emotions that second
night,” Adams grinned. “So I sat on one bench part
of the time and the other the rest of the game. I told
the fellows that I was giving very impartial training.”

As trainer, Adams’ main job was to tape ankles,
and as he put it, “to look after anybody that got
shaken-up.”

A little nervous at first, Adams said he finally
got up his courage and just walked in the 76er
dressing room.

“TI saw this fellow on the training table in there

so I walked up to him, stuck out my hand, and said,

‘My name is John Adams, I’m gonna be your trainer.’
“Then he stuck out his hand and said, ‘John,

glad to meet you, my name is Wilt Chamberlain.’ ”

Adams was full of
tales of what he called
a “once in a lifetime
experience.” He talked
about the commercial
he and Lou “Honey-
comb” Johnson joking-
ly decided to do for
$500, for a footpowder
company.

“Of course we were
just kidding but the
rest of the boys didn’t
know it, and when
‘Honeycomb’ * smiled . %
(showing his gold star- .”"
red tooth) and said he
didn’t know about do-
ing it, a couple of
others in the dressing ©
room said, ‘Man, if he
won't do it, I will; I
will.’ ”

JOHN ADAMS
Big Time Taper

. Last spring at the Hetzel-Cunningham game
in Charlotte, Adams met Billy Cunningham, the
76er rookie who starred at UNC last year. Since
Cunningham was sick Friday, Adams spent a good
deal of time with him.

‘HI JOHN! HOW’RE YOU DOING’

“I saw him in the dressing room again before
the game Friday night and spoke to him. He said,
‘Hi John! How're you doing?’ I was really surprised
he remembered my name.”

Adams was not the only Davidson student to

come away from the pro games $80 richer.

Jim

Hyder kept score and made the same thing.

“I don’t think Hyder got to talk to any of them,”
Adams noted. “He told me Chamberlain came over
and asked him something about a foul.”

However, Adams did “talk to them,” all of them.
He almost glowed as he bubbled over with excite-
ment from his experience.

“They were real good boys; funny. I got to talk
to them all. We kidded and joked a lot, they were

just good fellows.”

Wealthier by $80 and a store of tales, Adams
grabbed a box of tape and walked under Richardson
Stadium’s bleachers toward the Wildcat dressing
room, and his regular customers, the football team.

Sigs, Betas Roll On As Taus Fall!

The Kappa Sigs held the
spotlight in IMAC flicker-
ball action for the ump-
teenth consecutive time this
week and kept their lead in
the loop’s standings with a
6-0 record. Meanwhile, the
Betas became the only other
undefeated team by virtue
of the ATO’s loss to the
Sigma Chis in the week’s
headliner on Monday.

The Sigs, not nearly so im-
pressive as in days of old, still
had more than enough punch
to wallop the Pikas Wednesday.
Credit for victory actually should
go to the Kappa Sig defensive
unit, as it was their runbacks
of intercepted passes that turn-
ed the game from a display of
lackadaisical sloppiness to a
runaway.

The Pikas would undoubtedly
have done better if they had
spent as much energy playing
as they did in complaining about
the less than perfect officiating.

The Beta team, rumored to be
a contender this year, showed
little class as they bested the
cellar-dwelling Phi Gams 39-34

on Monday. The game was in
doubt until the final ten seconds
when safety Jim Timnions in-
tercepted a Gam pass to secure
the victory. Noted tailback Jack
Sherrill, ‘“‘We really were bad.”
Dan Sweet and David King play-
ed outstanding for the Phi
Gams.

There was less doubt over the

opponents, the Independents,
were never even in the game.
As a matter of fact, there wasn’t
any game, as the Gamma Delts
could produce only two players.
and had to forfeit. They did
manage to field a team Monday,
but that wasn't enough; the
KA’s dropped them 20.0.

Sigma Chi'’s seven, which is
a better team' than its record
implies, pulled out another close
one Monday, over the ATO's.
With the score tied at 13 all and
only 18 seconds remaining in
the game, the Taus started a
play that propelled the ball to
defender Basil Hicks. The Chis
flickered it down the field and
into the zone, and with that the
ATO’s succumbed.

But that wasn't enough, Geor-
die Mueller and brother Machis
took on the Sigma Nus yester-
day. When it was all over, the
score was 43-6 in favor of—well,
it wasn't the Sigma Nus. Asked
about Nu flickerball fortunes,
Edgar McFarland spat out a
half dozen epithets and then
remarked _ enthusiastically,

The home folks will have another chance to view the all-but-unbelievable Wild-
cats, as they return to action here tomorrow against William and- Mary, their third

consecutive Southern Conference opponen:, after a week’s layoff.

Coach Homer Smith described
the Indians as ‘‘by far the best
team we've played. They are in
a different class from the teams
we've played before. We'll be
moving up a notch, and we are
very pleased to do so. We want
to keep stretching ourselves."’

William and Mary’s 1-3 record
is about as deceiving as the ser-
pent in the garden of Eden.
They have lost to VPI (by two
points), West Virginia, and
Navy, while defeating a strong
V.M.I. team, 32-21.

Hindsley Hacks Foe Backs

By TOMMY COX
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Say Pack Hindsley and
snarling wolves appear in
your mind. Then say in the
same breath, “ ‘container’
with a big ‘87’ on his back
throws a halfback fot a 10
yard loss with a clothes-line
tackle.”

Pack Hindsley plays football.
“I like to play. The competition
is mentally good for a person,
and football gives me an ad-
vantage — to get excited in one

j/ direction. Unless you've singled

out one thing in your life to

‘| work and try to be the best at,
| you've lost an opportunity."

Before a game Pack's stom-

‘| ach will hold only Nutriment. He

mentally keys himself by con-
centrating only on that game so
that nothing else is important.

“The job must be done. It's
the most important thing you
can be doing at that time.

There's nothing more import-
ant. That’s the way football is
played.”

Davidson has surprised a lot
of people this year with the
brand of football they've played.
The ‘Cats are ravenous and
seething. and who expected it
—except Homer Smith and his
team?

Hindsley typifies the feeling,
“A team must beat us physical-
ly to win. They've got to earn
the yardage they get. We've
won this year because we
haven't let them and because
we take advantage of their mis-
takes. Everybody is perform-
ing at the position he asked to
play, and they've done it ef-
ficiently.”

Hindsley began talking about
the Davidson team. ‘Our great-
est weakness is the age-old lack
of depth, but we've made up for
it. We've. won on hard work and
the fact that each person has
defeated his opponent physical-
ly. We don’t have as much tal

New Press Facility
Opens Tomorrow

Davidson‘s new pressbox nears
completion as Saturday will
mark the opening of the press
and scouting facilities after
nearly two month's work.

The cost of the ultra-modern
steel and wood structure js in-
cluded in a $50,000 dollar chal-
lenge grant from the Richardson
Foundation, who also provided
the money for the stadium. The
money as given is to be used to
improve the field and stadium.

Dr. Tom Scott, athletic direct-
or, noted such improvements to
the stands and other spectator
facilities as new toilets, fiber-
glass seats, and improved park-
ing area. For the football team,
both varsity and freshman,
there are remodeled dressing

“We're looking forward to next
year when our team gets back
from Europe.”

Meanwhile the Taus didn’t roll
over and play dead. They rolled
over ‘the KA’s, who have defi-
nitely seen better days, by a
22-0 score yesterday. Dave
Townsend and Geoff Birkhead
shone for ATO. The KA’s had
pretty jerseys.

The Phi Delts, who are high
in the standings now but still
face the rough part of their
schedule, played the Sig Eps
Wednesday. They won 25-13 in
a boring game.

The SAE’s saw their only ac-
tion of the week in a Wednes-
day encounter with the Pl
Kapps. Everyone (for the E's,
that is) got into the scoring act
as they won 46-18. Paul Brown
allowed that he and his brethren
were rather relaxed for this one
and as a result were loose and
had good control of thé ball.
Mike Booe continued to excel at
tailback for the SAE's.

Last Friday's game saw the
Pikas beat the Sig Eps 39-7, ard

rooms. Also from the grant
Davidson will get a new base-
ball field, and in the future a
new visiting-team dressing room
(to be located under the East
Stands) together with a visiting
team dormitory.

The facilities in the heated
pressbox include sliding glass
windows, space for both radio
and television, and space for
both the home and_ visiting
teams to get an aerial view of
the game.

Underneath the pressbox will
be the President's box which
will not be finished for the Wil-
liam and Mary game. Of it Dr.
Scott said, “It will be as fine a
one as you will find anywhere in
the country.

the Sigma Nus top the Pi Kapps

ent. buf each player is making
fewer mistakes.

“To me Jerry Blackstock ‘has
performed brilliantly on offense,
His attitude is infectious to the
whole team. Dick Short and Tup-
per Morehead are vital to our
defense. George Solley has as
much desire as anybody — if
he weighed 220 pounds, he'd be
the best in the country. Of
course, you can't leave out
Steve Smith and Billy Taylor on
offense. Both are tremendous
ballplayers.”

Last season Pack played both
offense and defense, but he
says that this year he doesn’t
believe he could go both ways.
“I miss offense. but I'd rather
play defense. The game's chang-
ed too much to play both ways.”

Hindsley is a smart. but ag
gressive defender. Many times
a game Hindsléy pushes off two
or three blockers to make the
tackle. But. he adds, “Our team
defense allows two or three
players on.the ball carrier each
play.”

William and Mary. ‘‘They’ve

“I believe there’s been ab-

ago). There's been a gain. Our

around and its been really in-
spiring to watch the coaches do

A guy named Dunkel said the

defeated. To Pack Hindsley and
the rest of the team no scientific
system can possibly figure sav-
vy, physical courage, and an
enigma called desire.

Phi Delta Theta won the IMAC
tolal point championship for the.
ninth straight time last year ac-
cording to the figures ‘recently
released by IMAC President
Tommy Hunter.

The. Phi Delts won titles in
swimming, volleyball, track, and
tennis, and tied for the crown in
handball on the way to retiring
their third straight trophy.

Second in the standings were

On the rece‘ving end ‘is George
