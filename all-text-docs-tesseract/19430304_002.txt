Novice Song...

Never before, and perhaps never

again, has a new staff taken over the
reins of The Davidsonian in more un-
usual circumstances. It is a rather help-
less feeling.

The war has been with us for over_a

year now, but until recently it had
wrought few drastic changes in the clois-
tered-lite of Davidson. Reports have
drifted back from the fronts, both at
home and abroad of sacrifice and hero-
ism, of too little and too late, and lately
of the turning tide: Allied offensive,
victory in ‘43. These reports, in spite of
their sensational character, have not
really brought the war home to David-
There has been no real sacrifice
here in the sense that many know the
meaning of that word. News of the
deeds of friends, with us but yesterday,
have stirred us, but it has still seemed
unreal and far away to many.

sonians.

Suddenly, though, the changes have
become drastic. Activated by the urgent
need for manpower of a nation involved
in a conflict. for survival, the govern-
ment has reached its long arm into our
midst with its call to the colorsh. Frater-
nity brothers, roommates are leaving in
droves. We that remain have a restless
feeling.

Uncertainty,
tively,

individually and collec-
is the chief nemesis of the Dav-
idson spirit arising out of this crisis. We,
the new staff, in our journalistic ven-
ttire, are plagued by that uncertainty.
Our ranks are depleted, the impetus to
work is gone for some. But we intend to
carry on as long as possible For a Better
Dazidson, now and after the war.

Welcome Cadets...

The Davidsonian extends on behalf of
the Davidson student body a hearty wel-
come to you cadets of the Army Air
Forces, who will be with us for the next
five months. We hope that besides shar-
ing the physical equipment of our college
with you we may also share some of the
Davidson spirit- which is-our heritage.
We know that your life here will of nec-
essity be strictly regimented, but we seek
‘as cerdial a relationship as is possible

between our student group and yours.

You are doing big things for your
country. Many of our alumni are already
in similar service all over the world.
More are joining them every week. We,
ourselves, will be going soon. Until we
are called we are seeking to make the
most—of-our- educational- opportunities,
and in that way we too feel that we are
serving our country in a smaller way.

Your coming has of course brought
about a crowded condition on the cam-
pus, for you and for the regular college
students. The dormitory which you in-
habit was occupied by students two
weeks ago. However, we are glad for
Davidson to have this opportunity for
more direct participation in the war ef-
fort. May we repeat that we are happy
to have you with us, and however close
or distant our relationship with you, may
it be a pleasant one. We’ consider you
from now on as a real and vital part of

_ Davidson College. We wish you greatest

success in your work here. Davidson is
proud to have a part in your training.

To the Townspeople:

-At.the Fray and Bragiotti concert
last week I happened to get a seat
in approximately the center of one
of the middle sections of the audi-
torium. I considered myself lucky
to get such a choice seat, but was
stupid enough not to take cogniz-
ance of the fact that four little
seven and eight year old boys were
occupying the row in front of me.
Had I used any sense at all, I should
have immediately moved as far

away from that place as possible.
The result of sitting behind the
little boys, unfortunately, was that
the concert, instead of being enjoy-
able as it should have been, became
a prolonged torture. The little boys
did not actually make much noise,
but their fidgeting around playfully,
their w hispering, and their giggling
were terribly annoying to those in
the vicinity. I in no way condone

Pitch-and-Toss

By CHARLIE BROCKMAN

On The Decline And Fall of Ra-
dio’s Plug-Ads.

Sometime last Spring there ap-
peared in the Reader’s Digest an
article called “Radio's Plug-Uglies”,
which was a rather fluent attempt
at putting a stop_to the absurdities
by the makers of var-
ious products in an attempt to sell
said products.

For a time it appeared that this
article might bring relief to mil-
lions of wretched listeners, but late-
ly there have appeared several new

broadcast

plugs which make the previously-—~

silly Pepsi Cola ditties sound like
excerpts from a master’s thesis. To
wit: this bit of gurgling comes
beaming out of WBT from sun-up
til!” supper,
singsong by a voice which would
appear to belong to a normally-de-
veloped woman:

“—And don't forget darling,

Bring some Skinner's. Macaroni,

And some Skinner's Spaghetti

And some Skinner’s Skinner's

Skinner’s Skinner’s Skinner's

Da... da... Skinner’s!!"

Less annoying only by virtue of
the fact that it-is not quite so
lengthy is the following, whined by
the childish voice of “Wee Bonnie
Baker”, who evidently is out of any"
thing else to do:

“Buy Dentyne

brand new!

And some Dentyne regular too!”

Even if we could acquiesce to this
pitiful request, we don't to

peppermint, — it's

want

after the fiftieth time of that!

Surely no human being in_ his
right mind started the baloney about
“hustle-bubbles”, or worse, the ex-
tended ode on a «soap-box which
eventually terminates :

“.—Super-Suds, Super-Suds,

Nothing does like SiuperStuuu-
u—uds.”

‘Then too, chirping for another
soap in imitation of the more intel-
lectual bob-white, is the female who
squeaks, “Rinso-WHITE,  Rinso
WHITE!”

These insults, hurled incessantly
at American intelligence, put the at-
least-original “B.O.” foghorn among
the classics,

It’s bad enough when such plugs

chirped in—a—sort—of—tast—at—afternoon,but-when_pro-

grams that listeners depend on for
real entertainment resort to such
idiotic tactics, something ought to
be: done. Lucky | Strike’s cryptic
“Best Tunes of All, etc.”, repeated
some sixty times in less than an
hour, nearly drove once-devoted list-
eners from the Hit Parade a few
weeks ago. Before that we were
wishing that the same firm could
keep their d—— “green” and send
the commercials to war.

If such gruesome epithets annoy
the listener who turns on the radio
tor a little relaxation, imagine the
effect on the —already-harassed
housewife. If any salesmanship is
involved, it is only the stimulation
of a desire to sell the radio to the
first junk man who shows up!
