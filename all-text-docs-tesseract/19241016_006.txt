will be a battle royal; for from all re-

jone this year. Five of the men on the

(Continued from page 1)
est friendships of which we have record and
may be compared to the matchless friendship,
lof David and Jonathan. It is what should
be developed among you men in college, The
{friendships you make now will mean more
‘to you insygars-to come than any other phase
of your college course. The companionship
in work brought Paul and Titus to the place
where they naturally depended on cach oth-
er. Paul’s confidence in him was such that
he could say, ‘I could place my soul in the
palm of your hand and know it was safe.”

Then Dr. Raynal said that there were cer-
tain reasons why these things were true, It
|arose from the fact that Titus was a worker.
a man who believed in work. There was a
time cwhen the church at Corinth grew so
burdensome that Timothy couldn't handle it.
Then Paul sent Titus to Corinth to assist in
the work,

“This epistle of Paul to Titus is all-re-
vealing,” continued the speaker,
'that Titus was a man of action, a man of
ability, a man to be trusted, a man who
worked and who did it without being totd
to do so. The work of the world in days
to come must be done by the the men who
see their tasks, and go at them, even when
it seems they have no help, no support, and
that they are facing their tasks alone.”
| The speaker closed by urging that each
do his work with all his might in college,
,in the church, in the world, or in the home.
1 for the world is tired of drones and there is
always a place for a man who will take up
la task humbly and do it to the best of his
j ability.

The music was led by Piggy Martin. The
iGlee Club Quartet gave a special number.
| Phil Cox and Buck Shaw led in prayer.
