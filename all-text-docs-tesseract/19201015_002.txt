Well, bunch—don’t ever get it in-
to your head that those boys laid,
down last week. It was just a case
of not being able to stand up under |
the terrific hammering of the Gol-:

' Fellows—that’s the worst David-,
son has been beaten as long as the
inhabitants of this quiet and peace-
ful village can remember. One of;
our hayseed celebrities who has been ;

I've watched her men, with keen
delight,

Strive with might and main,

I’ve watched them fight an uphill
fight

To win for us again.

In every kind of contest,
In every kind of game,
When winning or when losing,
They always play the same.
That’s the kind of spirit
That sure appeals to me:
My hat is off in honor,
To the wearers of the “D.”

Listen to This.

As a result. of Washington and
Lees’ 6 to 0 victory of the Wildcats
two weeks ago, Coach Raferty of'
the Generals, makes the following!
statement. |

“Washington and Lee had a hard,
fight with the Wildcats because the
Generals were not well prepared.,,
with only 10 days’ practice and two.
days scrimmage behind them.” He
also goes on to praise the work of
Davidson’s eleven and in conclusion
says, “Had the Generals been up to
the standard for, this time of the
season they should have beaten
Davidson by 2 or 3 touchdowns, and
on the basis of first downs made, the |
Generals showed up at least four
touchdowns better.”

Fellows—this is not the true
spirit of Washington and Lee or of
its athletic teams. Never before
have we heard her coaches offer an
excuse for winning by such narrow
margins as the two field goals in
the game of two weeks ago. Don't
hold the above quotations against
the clean name that Washington
and Lee has firmly established with
us in our former intercollegiate con-
tests. There was no need for an “ex-
cuse,” on Coach Raferty’s part.

It wasn’t the team’s fault that
they were only gotten together ten
days before their initial game. Also
everyone knows that the Generals
have not the material back, from
last year’s whirlwind eleven, which
by the way only won from the
Wildcats by a 7 to O score. I[f the
assumption is true that they were
four touchdowns better than David-
son, on a basis of first downs made
—why did they not produce a first
down when within the shadows of
our own goal posts, and incidentally
score at least “one” of those four
touchdowns.

So cut this gossip out on the
campus, that Washington and Lee
said this and said that. “THEY
DIDN'T.”

On to Charlotte Saturday. Let’s
take the old Queen City by storm
and everything that goes with it—
Wake Forest included. The Bap-
tists are putting out a stellar brand
of football this season, and will no
doubt furnish plenty of fight.

Get your pencils out and dope the
followmg statistics:

Georgia Tech 44, Wake Forest 0.

Georgia Tech 66, Davidson 0.

Now wait—don’t get down in the
mouth. Listen to this:

Wash. and Lee 27, Wake Forest 0.

Wash. and Lee 6, Davidson 0.

That ought’er get ’em.

THIS YEAR’S QUINTET

TO BE A WINNER

Prospects Bright for Excellent
Season of Basketball.

The prospects are bright this year
for the best basketball team ‘that
Davidson has had since the “Dutch
and George” combination, which al-
ways put Davidson on top. Al-
tho the season is several ‘months
away, the followers of the court
game are looking forward with
much hope for Davidson to again
conquer all rivals.

The Varsity wili have a very hard
schedule, including three trips of
three games each. The first trip into
Virginia where the Wildcats will
mect U. of V.. W. & L.. and V. M. T.
Following this trip into the Old
Dominion, the Davidson five tackles
three teams from the Old North
State on their floors. Next they
invade South Carolina. [t will be
of great interest for most students
to learn that nine games will be
played on the local floor. This fact
will be of greatest importance and
value to Coach Hengeveld’s pro-
teges, if the student body will back
the Wildcats to the limit:

Among the reasons for the high
hopes of the Red and Black support-
ers is the fact that Coach Henge-
veld is again to have charge of the
squad. Four of last year’s varsity
will again don the Red and Black

uniform, these are, Captain L.
Schenck, Roberts, Romefelt, and
Streibeck. Also several prominent

varsity prospects are, John Schenck,
captain of last year’s Clemson. five,
and Norman Sheppard of the Caro-
lina Freshman team. Many of last
year’s scrubs will again pive the
varsity men a hard fight for their
places,

SPECIAL TRAIN TO TAKE
STUDENT BODY

' TO CHARLOTTE
Saturday promises to be a red let-
ter day for Davidson and especially
for the student body. Classes wiil
be suspended at eleven fifteen and
the entire student body arrayed in
their “gay rags” and with “pennants
galore” will migrate on the eleven
fifty Dinkey to Charlotte. Special
coaches will be added to the train
to accommodate the students ac-
companied by the band, and an un-
limited amount of push and pep to

support the gridiron heroes.
All of the old men remember the
visit last year to the Queen City and
also to the Twin City with a great

deal of pleasure. With an increased
“number in the student body there is
' prothise of cnough spirit to show the
mhabitants of Charlotte and the fol-
lowers of Wake Forest just what
Davidson loyalty is. The students
are counting on giving their team
such backing that they will be well
started on a series of victories when
the day has been won.

A special train will leave Char-
lotte at cleven o'clock to convey the
students back to Davidson, thus
giving them plenty of time after the
game to enjoy a square meal and see
all the sights of the city.

Pep! Pep! Pep! That's the
‘Slogan.
SEVERAL MEETS TO BE

; RRANGED

FOR GOLF TEAM

All the world’s a golf-course and
all freshmen merely caddies.

More than a usual amount of in-
terest is being shown in golf this
year, and every afternoon the course
is thronged with ardent players of
all ages and descriptions.

Although the links are not yet in
ship shape condition they will be by
the end of the week. Much creidt
is due to Dr. Arbuckle for his in-
terest and zeal in this matter and he
deserves the thanks of the entire

| student body for his untiring labors
in their behalf. ,

This is the first year that golf has
jbeen under the supervision of the
Athletic Association and the whole
student body is eligible to play and
lit is hoped that they, one and all
will take advantage of the opportu-
nities offered them. A committee
has been appointed by Dr. J. M.
| Douglass to decide the qualifications
for a letter.

A low ball match has been ar-
ranged with Salisbury and Messrs

Houston, White and Harry Sample ;
may be counted on to take care of
their end of the matter. Other
matches are soon to be scheduled
not only with teams in this state,
but also in South Carolina and Vir-
ginia. The majority of these games
will be played in the Spring, which
gives everyone ample time to get in
good shape.

The advantages of golf are too
numerous to mention and must be
soon realized by even the most
casual observer. From a health
standpoint, it may be said that the
lame, the blind, and the halt all play
golf; judging by appearances es-
pecially the blind.

Clubs, balls, and other imple-
ments of war may be secured from
the Macamac Company at their
usual moderate and reasonable
prices.
