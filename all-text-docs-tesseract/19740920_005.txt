When I first heard that Ralph Nader
was going to speak at Davidson, I
thought, that’s really nice; we should
have had him long ago.

' However, as the date approached, I
realized that I was not all that excited
about hearing the famous muckraker
in person. After all, what could he say

that he hadn’t already said hundreds ~

of times, especially to college audien-
ceslikeus? ;

Nevertheless, I was prevailed upon
in the last moments, and I don’t regret
faving gone. I found Nader quite en-
tertaining and mildly inspiring.

On the entertainment side, there
were his substantial digs into some of
our best-loved enemies: giant cor-
porations, deadly academics, and
Jesse Helms.

Also amusing, and unavoidable,
was the revivalistic analogy--from the
reverant, expectant hush as the
audience’ awaited Nader’s entry, to
his mixture of folksy anecdotes with
vivid visions of nuclear hell, then his
final plan of salvation and an in-
vitation to come forward for com-
mitment at the close of the meeting.

Still, despite such vicious com-
parisons, how can you agree with
what the man stands for? That’s why I
was caught off-guard by the reactions
I encountered when I went back to my
dorm. m
I suppose that most students loved
Nader, but I ran into quite a few who

were vociferating against Nader as _

wildly as, say, GM board directors.

Granted, some - reasonable
arguments were made. Some com-
plained that Nader occasionally em-
ployed irony and sarcasm rather than
sticking to his facts, while attacking
corporations for similar non-factual
propaganda.

Others laughed at the idea of hun-
dreds of naive college students
walking into and cleaning up the dens
of corporate iniquity.

However, my impression was that
most of this negative reaction was
simply a profound resentment of
Ralph Nader and what he stands for.

That me, because it
brought to mind all of the similar
remarks I had been hearing for years
from members of that other universe,

our parents’ generation.

I had never understood why my
father seemed to resent Nader’s con-
frontation of the auto industry and his
demonstration that their |
were unsafe. Why should that offend
anyone other than the auto makers?

Now my friends were reacting the
same way. Why does Nader provoke
hostility in individuals who are
theoretically only helped, not hurt, by
his investigations.?

One reason, I suppose, is that most
people resent anyone who claims to
have as many answers as Nader does.

To them, he is arrogant, ‘‘Smart,’’ a
trouble-maker. That a young man just
out of school, would dare to confront a
whole regiment of American dream-
makers:is enough alone to infuriate a
lot of people.

Besides, weall love our automobiles
and our illusions. Nader’s attack is on
the whole mythology of the beneficen-
ce of American industry and special
interests. That attack is less
American than cornflakes to those
who have come to agree, even sub-
consciously, that what is good for GM
is good for the country.

Nuclear Carnage

Another sore point about Nader is .
that he isn’t easily categorized. He
has nothing in common with the
freaks, the critics who Americans had
had to deal with and had learned to -
ignore, such as Leary, Ginsburg, or
Angela Davis.
. Nader is an insider, clean-cut, Ivy
League, highly intelligent, with a
passion only for his work, and there is
certainly nothing more. American
than hard work. Because Nader was
an insider, his betrayal smarted all
the more.

Finally, Nader’s success deflates
the comfortable assumption that an
individual cannot effectively confront
the giants. He thereby eliminated a
good excuse for complacency. This
must be particularly irking for
students who are not about to be for-
ced into social responsibility.

That is, I suppose, what those
Davidson students resented above all
about Nader. He was telling them that
they are going to have to choose bet-
ween ‘“‘comfortable” acquiescence
and intelligent and res op-

particularly

position. That is not a
popular message.

Only the organ music was missing.

Ever notice how many black

Oh yes, our janitors and

‘Ascent of Man’ Captures
Human Cultural Evolution

This is my enthusiastic en-
dorsement _ of Jacob
Bronowski’s film series ‘“The
Ascent of Man,”’ which is
showing here in Davidson on
Monday evenings.

I’m elected to endorse it -

because I was one of about
3,000 people who saw it during
thesummer at Queens.

It is Bronowski’s per-
sonalized account of the
cultural development, of man
from the hang Bagpargsorin with
strong - but, by no means ex-
clusive - emphasis on his
science and technology, and
on their implications. The
British Broadcasting Cor-

poration spent over $3.5 .

million on the series, sending”
two. film crews all over the”
world ‘during more than. two

years.
broadcast in the U.S. during
this year at least.)

Some of you will remember
that Bronowski was a very
stimulating Reynolds Lec-
turer here six or eight years

‘Science and Human Values’’
- a big factor in his Reynolds
invitation.

Others may recognize him
as a truly Renaissance man -
mathematician, philosopher,
literary critic, Certainly one
of the world’s leading
authorities on William Blake.

The Charlotte showing was,
I’m pretty sure, the second in
the U.S. arranged by Central
Piedfmont Community
College, which is also making
it available here.

(But it will not be ~

The response in Charlotte

Bronowski successfully in-
terrelates an awesome range
of diverse information, but he
does it unpretentiously and
winsomely. The visual impact
of many of the background
scenes is most impressive.

, Because of previous com-
mitments of Love Auditorium,
it has been necessary to
schedule two films each Mon-
day night.

Thirteen separate sessions
would certainly be better, but
apparently there’s no way out.
