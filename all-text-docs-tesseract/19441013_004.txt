Into The Life of Things

By J. S. BLAIN

Continuing the same policy as we pursued this sum-
mer, Into the Life of Things will seek to put before the
students some thoughts of a spiritual nature based chiefly
on the talks made in Chapel and Vesper services through-
out the year.

_ The opening Vesper service of the term was conduct-
ed by Dr. Carl Pritchett, pastor of the local church. Dr.
Pritchett is at present acting as secretary of the Y. M. C.
A., and‘is a man who wants to know the students, and who
has been a great source of help and inspiration to many
Davidson men.

In his excellent sermon, Dr. Pritchett emphasized
three points which are the evidence of spiritual maturity
in man. The deeply rooted, personal religion of a man is
the first of these. Also an educated, sensitive conscience
which will guide all decisions, is a prime essential. A
personal devotion to Jesus Christ is the third. These
marks of maturity of soul are worthy aims for every stu-
dent to have in his career at Davidson.

Dr. James A. Jones, of Charlotte, encouraged the
students to remember that merely to have ideals, aims, and
resolves is not enough. Every man must have the forti-
tude to back up his resolves, and to live the life which God
meant that he should live.

In his usual original manner, Dr. KennethsJ. lore-
man, of our own faculty centered his sermon on last Sun-
day night around the question, “After V-Day, What?”
With this question as his subject, Dr. Foreman proceeded
to ask a few more pertinent qttestions. Quoting from
Time magazine, he pointed out that the government antici-
pates no V-Day, and expects a lengthy period of fighting
in the Pacific after the European war ends. He also point-
ed out that victory will be useless unless a policy of relief,
rehabilitation, and reorganization is carried out in the con-
quered countries.

Dr. Foreman then applied his questions to the indi-
vidual mind and soul, asking the all important questions:
“Are you fighting the evil in your own soul? What about
your V-Day?” ‘The celebration of V-Day in our earthly
and spiritual wars is the true standard by which we can
determine whether we deserve our victories. The. truly
final victory comes when “Christ establishes His beach-
head in your soul.”

Professor Beatty’s impressive Chapel service in honor
of Jimmy Fulcher was one which will long be remembered
in Davidson. The sympathy of all is with Jimmy’s family,
and it is a real and devastating blow to the college and the
community: to lose this one who was loved and honored
by all who knew him.

birds (?) with one razor blade.

To sum_up the matter in one
brief statement: an unenjoyable
time was had by all.

We've heard that a lot of boys
are still under the impression that
there is a girl shortage. It is of our
opinion that the fellows fre cither
too engrossed in their studies (joke)
or they have no sense of direction
for they refuse to believe that there
are sixteen hundred girls at Win-
thrope College who would like to
havé dates. (Hint). From our own
personal observation (oh boy!) they
are really a wonderful bunch of
girls.

study of parliamentary order, and
other related work of the societies
is highly valuable. Further, there is
a social value which is not to be
overlooked.

“During these days when travel
is not so easy, these societies could
be especialy helpful to the life of
the college”.

The president also stated that an-
nouncement of further post-war
plans for Davidson Colege will be
announced in a few weeks.

STARTLING SPEED SEEN
FOR FUTURE TRAVELERS

LONDON, Oct. 4—A House of
Commons committee heard a pre-
diction yesterday that in the not
far distant future passengers may
travel between:New York and Lon-
don faster than sound in pilotless
stratosphere planes—like riding a
flying bomb. .

The prediction was made by Sir

Henry Tizard, formerly head of re-
search in the Aircraft Production
ministry, in urging the government
to allot $4,000,000 for civil aviation
research.
