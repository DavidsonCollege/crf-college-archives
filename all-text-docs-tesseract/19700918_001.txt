Officials To Delay Enforcement
Of Restrictions On Refrigerators

By JOHN McLEAN
Associate Editor

College officials are ex-
pected to announce Friday
that enforcement of the new
rule against large refriger-
ators in dormitories will be
postponed until next year.

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, Di-
rector of Student Housing,
decided that the new rule

would be discarded after con-
sultation with college treas-
urer Robert A. Currie and

Residence Hall President
Cecil Burney.

Burney had objected to the
new rule, saying he felt stu-
dents should be allowed to
keep refrigerators in their
rooms and also small cook-
ing appliances.

Currie had said the regis
tration of such appliances
would create too many ad-
ministrative problems, ac
cording to Mrs. Nicholls.

Students are to be advised
of the rule revocation in a
letter from Mrs. Nicholls Fri-
day. The letter says, in part,
that students may keep re-
frigerators of over 50 watts
or 2 cubic feet in dorms only
through this. year.

The letter also ste

dents not to buy new large
refrigerators, since the rule
will be in force next year.
But at that time, she said,
the Charlotte Chair and
Equipment Rental Co. will
ben on campus to lease or

sell students regulation size
refrigerators.

After this year, Mrs.
Nicholls said, there will be
no storage space available

for oversized refrigerators in
the rooms or storage areas.

The scuttled — restrictions
were made during the sum-

NUMBER ONE

Freshmen Begin College Careers

By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

Amidst the fanfare of ex
perimental coeducation, cur-
riculum changes and revi
talized freshmen dormitories
291 freshmen. survived the
traditional orientation per-
iod for new students this
past week.

Several changes instituted
by freshmen advisors Joe
Smith and Herb Clegg were
evident in orientation.

Freshmen camp, held at
Camp Thunderbird in recent
years, was eliminated, and
the orientation program was
held in its entirity on cam-
pus.

Also, the traidtional _ lec-
tures which have structured
past orientations were re-
moved from the program,
with student-led discussion
groups replacing them.

The freshmen, transfer stu-

tors remains college policy,”
she said, but enforcement
has been postponed until next
year.

‘in the

dents, foreign students, and
10 female exchange students
began their Davidson exper-
ience last Thursday  after-
noon ‘with a greeting from
Samuel R. Spencer Jr., col
lege president.

Then after an afternoon of
testing, the new — students
were treated to a picnic with
the faculty followed by a key-
note address by John M. Be-
yan, the new vice-president
of academic affairs, — on
‘Education at Davidson.”

On Friday the freshmen
were given a curriculum
over-view from Jay H. Ost
walt, college registrar, and
attended “‘intefest groups”
afternoon to discuss
with advisors possible cours-
es of study .

Spencer addressed the
freshmen on Friday night,
speaking to them on "Dav

idson 1970-1974; the Presi-
dent's View.”
Saturday was highlighted

by Bevan's second address,
and by the annual mixer with
the Queens freshmen.

An open house in the fresh
men dorms for the faculty
members filled Sunday af
ternoon for the freshmen.

Orientation periods on Mon
day and Tuésday were filled

ay
with® short talks from stu

dent leaders on subjects such
as fraternities, the honor
system, and the Code of Re-

sponsibility.
‘Reactions to orientation
were varied. Smith and

Clegg. in charge of the pro-

gram, saw it as being suc
cessful,
“The freshmen and _ oth-

er new students were very

responsive to the programs

and to us,” Clegg said. ‘'I
feel personally that this fresh-
man class is more mature

and more prepared for col
lege than some previous
freshmen classes.”
Freshmen in general seem
ed satisfied with orientation,
although many felt that per-

haps the program was too

long. “There were several
portions of the orientation
that weren't needed, such as
the lectures on the evils of
alcohol,” one freshman com-
mented.

Attendance~ at orientation
meetings, although not re-
quired, was high until the
last few programs on cam-
pus activities.

Academic Vice President Stresses
Experiences Outside Classroom

By RICH WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

A man of concern, .. a
man of fascination, these are
the first impressions of Dav-
idson’s vibrant Vice President
of Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan.

In an interview with THE
DAVIDSONIAN this week,
Bevan expounded on his edu-
cational philosophy as_ well
‘as his personal feelings? how-
he declined to com-

ever,
ment on Davidson's  pre-
sent academic organization.

Since I haven't had time

to evaluate ahd experience
the courses here, I’m not
ready to say what my aspir-
ations are just yet, I think it
is important to judge priori
tics before we a jot of
money on things that have
been long gone,” he said.

Bevan did, though, outline
four areas where he hopes to
concentrate his efforts. In-
ternational study’ and career
service will be two of these
areas.

Bevan said he thought
that some career service
programs should receive aca-
demic credit. ‘After all,"’ he
said, ‘‘many students have
questions that can and should
be answered by working.

“Career service truly gives
education breadth and depth.
Not only are the students
getting something out of this
experience, but they are giv-
ing something as well.

“I get tired of professors

snenad

their students that
what they are studying in
class will be important to
the student sometime in the
future. I've found that two
thirds of what was supposed
to be important wasn't."

Bevan called for a balance
between career service and
classroom education. ‘‘In
short,"’ he said, *‘I'd like to
see outside experience vali-
date. classroom learning.”
He also hoped that Davidson
would include 150-200 stu-
dents each year in the career
service program.

telling

Independent study is anoth-
er concern of the Academic
Vice President.- Bevan said
he would like to see the stu-
dent plan and organize his
onw course of study and then
take it to the profesor for
approval.

The professor would then
judge whether the project
is worth doing, whéther the
student is able to do it, and
whether he (the professor)
would be willing to evaluate
the program. Once the pro--
fessor approves, Bevan feels
it is the student’s responsibil-
ity to,,do the rest.

“Independent study doesn't
cost much,” said Bevan,‘and
it really isn’t that time con-
suming for the faculty. I
thik each professor could
take on five or six students
in addition to his regular
teaching load.”

Interdisciplinary courses
are also of prime concern to
the former Davidson profes-

sor. “I think some students
should have the opportunity
for four years of interdis-
ciplinary study rather than
just two,”’ he said.
Concerning the role of the

college or university in soc
iety, Bevan feels that it must
be continually critical,
“Once the university stops
being critical of society, soc-

Underlying the entire ser

If a difference of opinion
could be detected it was be-

everyone but students, and
the students themselves.

Most seemed to agree that
such gatherings of the body
politic in the past had been
responsible for the greatest
sense of community. Stu
dent emphasis seemed more
on the quality of the gather
ing rather than its quantity.

The Code of Responsiiblity,
however, outweighed all oth-
er considerations of David-
son aS a community. On the
one hand was the feeling
that the. Code brought the
students very Close to harm-
ful individualism while uni-
fying the college as a respon-
sible community.

The position was taken that
the Code as a document by
students for students and
should be maintained under
a system of student enforce-
ment. An opinion seemed to

hold that if students could
not be held to their own rules
perhaps'the sense of com-
munity demanded other

forms of protection from in-
dividual license.

The student point of view

At that time, according to
EPC student representative
Danny Clodfelter, the issue
was placed at the top of the
agenda of things to discuss
at the committee's first meet-
ing Monday.

“The idea of self-sched-
uled exams involves two bas-

explained, include, arrang

recent conference with the
trustees in Charlotte, and
general legwork in setting

up other meetings.

He is also in charge of
the procurement and pub-
licity, as well as scheduling,
for special guests such as
John Kenneth Galbraith and
the Reynolds lecturers.

In addition he will act as
a pulse-taker of current stu-
dent ideas for’ Spencer, who
“wants to be closer to what
the students are thinking,”
Hobbie explained.

He is also secretary for
one of the trustee commit-
tees, and is working on the
coordination of the

driver volunteers and the
United Fund drive.

Speaking of the busing ar-
rangements, ‘“‘This is part
of the job I’m glad to work
on— the kind of communi-
ty work, we did in student
government.”

When asked how his ‘‘offi-
cial status’ would affect his
outside activities and form-
er participation in off-cam-
pus political work, such as

last. year’s moratorium ob-
servances and community
work, he replied “I would
hope very little.”

He added that he'd have
to wait and see, citing the

problems of his off-campus
activities possibly being iden-
tified with the office of Presi-
dent Spencer.

Hobbie was appointed to
the newly created position
in late August and signed a
one year contract. He said
that he did not intend to ex-
tend his. stay beyond that
time.

Clodfelter added that last
spring’s resolution solved the
first problem, and that ‘the
EPC feels that if the Honor
Court informs the students
of their responsibilities dur-
ing the exam week, the honor
system will survive

“What this resolution
means is° that the EPC is
committed to the idea of
self-scheduled exams. Now
the committee must resolve
the second question of the
actual mechanics of the pro-
gram.”

These considerations are
