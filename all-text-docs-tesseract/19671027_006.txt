College To Beef Up
Laundry, Safeguards

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Managing Editor

Steps to make the suddenly
vulnerable College Laundry
more secure are being taken,
according to Grover Meetze.
director of the physical plant.
Window reinforcements for
the Jaundry. robbed three
times in less than a month,
were ordered last month and
should arrive by the middle

of next week, Meetze said.
In addition, the college has
increased the night surveil-
lance of the building by cam-
pus security officers, he said.
“And we are looking into the
possibility of getting addi

tional protective devices."
The security steps were or-
dered last month by Robert
A. Currie. treasurer and busi-

ness manager. following rob-
beries of the laundry on the
nights of Sept. 26 and 28.

A third robbery occurred
Oct. 15.

The 16-year-old boy charged
with storebreaking and lar-
ceny in connection with the
first two robberies was con-
victed Tuesday in Mecklen.
burg County Recorder's
Court and given a 12-month
sentence to a first offender's
camp, suspended for a period
of three years.

The youth was placed on
three years probation.

A 13-year-old boy :whom
police said was an accessory
in the first two robberies and
then committed the third rob
bery himself after escaping

Jim Gillespie, freshman: “I think y)

freshmen should be recognized, and sae

also convicted Tuesday.

A Mecklenburg County Do-
mestic. Relations Court judge
committed the younger youth
to thc Leonard Training
School at McCain. near Aber-
deen. for 12 months.

The three robberies netted
over $275 from the laundry
cash register and the office
of Laundry Manager C. W.
Stacks, plus a number of
clothing articles.

All of the mony has been
recovered and returned to
the laundry, Stacks said, but
most of the clothing has not
been found.

Nearly $300 in claims have
been paid students who lost
clothing, according to Stacks.

Currie Says Private Construction

Freshmen Need Could Answer Housing Problems
Group Identity

In response to the question “Do you believe
freshman regulations are important enough to be
enforced as they are?” these students said:

Staff Writer -

Apartments built by private
industry were cited as the
best answer to the problem
of married students’ housing
this week by Robert A. Cur-
rie, college. treasurer and
business manager.

Student Council President
Tom Earnhardt told council
members Tuesday that his
meeting with Currie about the
problem was “‘profitable’’ and
that Currie was ‘‘sympathe-
tic to the situation."

The council decided to send
out letters to all Richardson
Scholars of the last 10 years.
asking them to appraise their
year at Davidson and evalu-
ate: its importance to their
later life.

It also appointed a com-

mittee to appraise the course -

evaluation forms which were
used last year and decide
whether the forms should be
used verbatim again this
year, revised or abandoned.

In his conversation with
Currie, Earnhardt said Cur-
rie agreed that changes in
the housing situation for mar-
ried students ought to be
made, but did not advocate
that the college undertake
such a task.

“This Is Dedicated To The
Rug I Love.”

The GNP’s constantly Muc-
tuating membership produces
these musical delights with
“numerous kazoos, a jug. a
washboard, a washtub bass,
several guitars, spoons, an
autoharp and a Jew’s harp.”
Wallace said.

At last count the sometime
members of the GNP were:
Tom Bersuder, Cary White.
John Pancake, Mike Norris,
Allen Lewis. Ashton Trice,
Freddy James, Jim Bailey,
Jim McNair and Butch.
Thompson.

Wallace added that he was
well pleased with the public's
acceptance of the GNP so
far.

“One of the fraternities is
thinking about getting a new
rug. and we may be invited
to play at the dedication
ceremony, And we've also
been mentioned as a_ possi
bility for the Queens College
Coffee House.

“In fact,’ he said, “we re
getting so popular that we re
thinking of expanding into
tablecloth and potholder dedi
cations.

‘We're basically motivated
by our love for rugs.” he
continued. ‘‘but other things
—such as the French roman
tic movement, Bach. Buck
Owens and His Buckeroos
with a little Carter Family
thrown in—have had a big in-
fluence on us. too.

“The only prerequisites for
membership in the Gross Na-
tional Product are grossness
and a love for rugs. And if
you're gross enough, you
don't even have to like rugs,”
he said.

“But we're not looking for
any new members,” Wallace
said. '‘We feel that we've got
the grossest people on cam.
pus already.

Currie said the best solu-
tion was to ‘“‘draw private
industry into the area to build
some apartments.” He ad-
mitted that such a judgment
was premature, however,
and said he would consider
the matter more closely in
connection with the specific
complaints raised by married
students in the recent Stu-
dent Council poll.

The council's letters to the
Richardson Scholars may
elicit a response which is en-
thusiastic enough to persuade
the Richardson Foundation to
fund the program for another
year, Earnhardt said. The

foundation recently announ-
ced that this would be the
last year it would finance the
program.

In connection with the
course evaluation. letters are
being sent to all faculty
members asking them wheth-
er they benefited from the
service last year and whether
they have suggestions for im-
proving the forms.

The committee consists of
Mike May, Peter Hobbie.
Steve Engstrom..and John
Williams.

Reporter: Latin America
‘Ripe For Communism’

Sam Summerlin, reporter
with the Associated Press in
Latin America, spoke at
chapel Tuesday on the politi-
cal problems of South Ameri-
ca.

Summerlin, who does most
of his work on Latin Ameri-
ca, foresees a revolution com-
ing there. Dictatorship is be-
ing fomented. if not -already
established, in many of the
countries. He cited the Cuban
and the Dominican crises as
examples.

Mystical Poetry

Referring to such poets as
Mallarme, Baudelaire and
‘Hart Crane, Dr. T. A. Wil-

liams of the French ‘Depart- |

ment spoke of ‘Mysticism

and Poetry’ at Open End
Wednesday night.
The mystical movement,

Williams said, stemmed di-
rectly from the Romantic
movements in England and
France, and although mystic-
ism is rooted in both France
and England, it developed
much more rapidly in
France.

In describing mysticism,
Williams adopted the insights
of William James, who as-
cribed four essential qualities
to mystical literature.

First, James said. the work
is poetic, that is, it com-
municates absolute know-
ledge. it transcends thinking.
Secondly, the work is monis-
tic—a complete, unitary
piece in which all opposites
are resolved. Mystical litera
ture is also ineffible. incom-
municable because the mysti-
cal experience itself is inde,
scribable. And lastly, mysti-
cal literature implies tran-
sience, for the insight of
mysticism can only be dis-
cerned momentarily.

Williams also examined
problems in writing such
literature. The poet's chief
problem is how to recreate
an experience that canont be
explained. he said.

“The reason for the ob-
scurity of mystical writings.”
he said, ‘‘is that it defies ex-
plication. It cannot be ana-
lyzed because the poem be-
comes more than the words
of the poem. The mystic
strives to create oneness or
unity within his work."

When Williams opened his

presentation to discussion,
the subject shifted from
poetry to mysticism in drugs.

Several students said they
felt that the mystical sensa-
tion produced with, drugs was
a penetration into men’s en-
vironment or some particular
and insignificant object while
poetical mysticism suggested
an escape from man’s en-
vironment into the realm of
the supernatural. But Wil-
liams replied by reading a
passage from the works of
Marcel Proust, who describes
the mystical, penetrating, be-
wildered emotion that he de-
rived from staring at a twig.
