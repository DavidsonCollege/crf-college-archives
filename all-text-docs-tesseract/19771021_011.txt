Students shed blood for Red Cross

By NANCY McNAIR

Davidson College is well on its way
to meeting a goal of 433 units of blood
donated to the American Red Cross
with the fall blood drive netting 272
units.

Linda McCannell, Assistant Direc-
tor of the Blood Program for the
Greater Carolinas Chapter of the
American Red Cross stated that 1000
such units a day are processed by the
Piedmont Carolinas Center. The 272
units donated at Davidson comprised
little more than a quarter of those
needed for the day by the 106
hospitals in the Piedmont Carolinas
Chapter.

The Red Cross emphasized that all
of the donor blood is given volun-
tarily. The donors are screened ver-

ON THE AISLE PRODUCTIONS will bring the
glittering musical “Cabaret’’ to Love Auditorium on
Thursday, October 27. The story of an innocent little
tramp and her British boyfriend caught in the whir’ of
pre-war German night life, it promises to be the fall

event at Davidson.

The production is full of vivacious songs and

bally before donating, and their blood
is screened clinically before it is sent
to the hospital for histories of diseases
such as hepatitis and malaria.

“Tf someone were being paid for
donating blood, | would question his
reason for giving. It would be easy for
him to forget that he had had
hepatitis,’ she added.

Because of the many large hospitals
in the Greater Carolinas Region, it
ranks fifth in the U.S., behind
Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, and
Los Angeles in the numberof units of
blood processed each year.

To cope with this 1000 units per
day demand, the Piedmont Carolinas
Chapter dispatches seven bloodmo-
biles each weekday to schools, shop-
ping centers and businesses to collect
blood.

Come to the cabaret...

animated cnaracters which have held a spot on
Broadway for three years. Davidson's Graham Smith
will have a part in the musical.

Tickets to the 8:15 pm performance are available at
the Union desk at $2.50 for college affiliates and $5.00

for all others.

Such a preat demand might seem
like preparation for a vampire’s
holiday, but Dorothy Butler estim-
ated that a single open-heart surgery
candidate at Charlotte Memorial Hos-
pital demonstrates‘the daily need.

Mrs. Butler of Charlotte Memor-
ial’s blood bank estimated that for the
day of surgery, a patient needs 10
units of whole blood, 10 of platelets
and 6 of fresh frozen plasma.

With two to three hearts per day,
five days a week, the numbers add
up,’ she said. ‘Although the physi-
cian would like to have the 10 units of
whole blood, this is not always
possible because it depends on what
the Red Cross has available,’’ she
added.

Any unused blood which remains
viable is redistributed through the

Red Cross.

The need for blood is an ever-
increasing demand with which the
Red Cross must plan to cope. The
195,000 units of blood needed this
year will increase by 20 percent next
year. .

According to McCannell, the Caro-
linas Chapter has a support system
with other cities, “but we have never
been in really bad shape.”

Only five percent of the general
population gives blood at present. *‘I
feel like a hypocrite when I urge
people to donate — but I’m ten pounds
underweight to give blood,’ noted
McCannell.

She stated, however, that she urges
non-donors to make their contribution
to the Red Cross effort by encourag
