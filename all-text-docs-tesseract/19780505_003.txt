International studies raises discussion

By DONALD CALDWELL

The amount of money bud-
geted annually for international
scholarships as well as its
allocation have exposed a wide
divergence of opinion regarding
the International Studies Pro-
gram.
peen the program’s budget it-
self. The figure earmarked has
been static at $20,000 since
1974, and some note that the
inflation during the recent four
years has significantly eroded
the sum in absolute terms.

Other factors have reduced
this amount further. Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs T.C.
Price Zimmermann commented
that spaces at British universi-
ties for foreign students have
decreased markedly in the past
decade, with an accompanying
increase in fees.

Davidson students returning
from a year at the Universites of
East Anglia and Reading have
felt their tuition of $1500 far too
high and asked the Administra-
tion for a decrease. The admini-

stration agreed to reduce the
figure to $750 annually.
_ ‘That $1500 fee had been
used to subsidize an English
student’s way here. We had to
make up the difference by using
International Education
funds,”’ said Zimmermann.
Coordinator of International
Studies Tony Boon added, “In
order to maintain Davidson's
sending students, we had to
reciprocate by accepting British
students. Presently, we send

six students to East Anglia and _

four to Reading.

“We have one student annua-
lly from East Anglia and one on
alternating years from Reading.
We will have representatives
from each in 1978-79.

Zimmermann cited that ‘‘the
result is we have fewer funds for
foreign students.”’

Many professors have voiced
concern over the administra-
tion’s action and the resulting
drop in available funds.

Director of South Asian Stu-
dies Tonia Devon felt there
would be a diminishing number
of students from third world
countries. ‘‘We have one non-

Washington—President Car-
ter has overruled the recent
Joint Chiefs of Staffs’ decision
to delay withdrawal of Ameri-

until Congress had agreed to
give military supplies to South

Korea. Aaa,
Washington—tsraeli Prime

Minister Menachem Begin was
in Washington Monday to cele-
brate the thirtieth anniversary
of Israel’s existence. At the
reception, President Carter ple-
dged eternal American support
for Israel in what Begin later
hailed as ‘‘one of the greatest
moral statements ever made.”’
Washington—President Car-
ter’s proposed arm sales pack-
age to Saudi Arabia and Egypt
is encountering great opposi-

tion, especially among the Jew-
ish forces in Congress.

The proposal requires an
approval within 30 days from
both the House and the Senate.
While most members of Con-
gress would like to examine arm
sales to each country separate-
ly, the Carter administration
insists that the proposal will
remain a package deal.

pine president Marcos. The
talks centered mainly on recent
relations between the two na-
tions, and human rights.

western student coming and an
African from the University of
Nairobi on a $4500 scholarship.

“The program with Cairo
University has been scrapped. I
think this is an indication of our
priorities.”’

Boon countered, ‘‘Even
though we don’t have a strong
relationship to St. Stephen’s in
Delhi, Cairo University, and the
University of Nairobi, that does
not mean they will be eliminat-
ed. We simply need to make
what we get go as far as
possible.”’

Zimmermann concurred, ‘‘We
are trying to apportion money
among non-European students,
from Africa and Japan in parti-
cular.”’

Yet doubt about the school’s
interest in the program and its
future remains. Professor of
French Lauren Yoder, member

of the International Education
Advisory Committee, stated ‘‘I
realize we are committed to
reciprocal arrangements with
Britain but I wonder where the
committment really is.’’

Another professor not in the
committee pointed out, that
many found it difficult to
support the program when ma-
ny foreign students participat-
ing seemed indifferent or dis-
illusioned.

In reference to the project’s
stable budget, Boon comment-
ed, ‘‘I’d love to see more foreign
students here, but money is
tighter than it has been in the
past. I do not see a correlation
between a fixed budget figure
and a decrease in our funds.”’

Professor of English Frank
Bliss, another member of the
advisory committee, added, ‘‘I
would hope funds for the inter-

national program will increase,
and such an increase has been
talked of about every year. I
think it is of immense value to
the campus -to have it continu-
ed.”

‘I am impressed they are
continuing to fund the program
in the face of inflation. I realize
other colleges and universities
have had to hold the line.”’

Zimmermann acknowledged,
“I think you could argue that
there has been a slight deem-{”
phasis of the scholarship pro-
gram. Some of the needed
money has been provided by
home governments or private
scholarship funds.”

Boon concluded by saying,
“The administration has decid-
ed that it would be appropriate
that international students as

educational tools be maintain-
eds”
