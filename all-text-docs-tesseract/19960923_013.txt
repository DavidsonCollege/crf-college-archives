A Religious Left?

The Sojourner’s conference bridges religious boundaries

By JiLL WILLIAMS
Associate Editor for Arts& Living

The Sojourners’ conference
on faith and politics was not a call
for revolution, but a “Call for Re-
newal” that bridged regional, ra-
cial, political, andreligious bound-
aries. The “Call” hoped to gather
grass roots activists and socially
concerned Christians representa-
tives of Catholic, mainline Protes-
tant, Black and Evangelical tradi-
tions with political and national
leaders such as former Senator
Bill Bradley and Marian Wright
Edelman.

A combination of efforts on
the part of the Christian Coalition
and the media have delivered us
into atime in which the term Chris-
tianity is equated with conserva-
tive Republican views. Politically,
many of the speakers would have
been classified as liberal in the

time before politicians in both par-
ties put a curse on that term.

They spoke for encourage-
ment, not just tolerance, of diver-
sity, for charity and rights for ostra-
cized citizens, from the poor to
homosexuals, and for wariness of
politicians who “invoke the name
of God” in political life. In their
gathering in Washington, DC, they
attempted to renounce all standard
labels of Democrat or Republican,
liberal or conservative.

Rather, as reported in the New
York Times on Monday, Septem-
ber 16, 1996, “The speakers angrily
and repeatedly targeted President
Clinton for compromising with the
Republican-controlled Congress
and signing the cast overhaul of the
Federal welfare program that is
ending decades of guaranteed sub-
sidies to the nation’s poorest chil-
dren.” Perhaps the situation was
analyzed best by Marian Wright

Edelman, head of the Children’s
Defense Fund and organizer of the
June 1st Stand for Chilren Rally,
when she stated with regard to the
cutting of Aid to Families with
Dependent Children, “What has
happened to us that we won’ t stand
up and say, ‘No, we won’t tolerate
that?’”

The fact that the conference
was a Christian movement does
not mean that it meant to exclude
non-Christians.

Although the conference was
uniquely Christian, the message
should transcend boundaries of
religious affiliation.

The “Call to Renewal” was
about ending political rhetoric and
opening dialogue between God,
yourself and other people; it was a
conference about integrating spiri-
tuality and political action, not an
alliance between the church and
partisan politics.

Everything’s possible with Pop-Cycle

By KATE GREENE
& JASON SCHMIDT
Concert Reviewers

Catfish Jenkins enlivened the
900 Room Saturday night. The
four person band appeared to be
an ordinary college band on their
one song debut on AWARE II, but
proved themselves to be anything
but on Saturday night.

Pop-Cycle, their new name,
consists of four men: three foot-
ball fanatics and a chess player.
The chess player doubles as their
lead vocalist and acoustic guitar-
ist. The others fill in the spots of
electric guitar and bassist and
drummer.

The vocals and acoustic gui-
tar were the energetic force be-
hind the show. One senior de-
scribed the sound to be a mix
between fellow Athenians, REM
and Journey. Junior Sanders
Hearne matter-of-factly claimed
that they were just “damn good.”
The sound was college-band meets
soul, as the guitarist sang with
face-squinching passion. Senior
Mary Baxter described the perfor-
mance, saying that “there is just so
much energy on stage, but some-
how it gets lost in the transition to
the audience. Once a spark of it
gets out, it is contagious.” :

One of their last tunes, the
80s hit “Safety Dance,” had more
than one Davidsonian out of their
seat dancing in all corners (in-
spired by the lone presence of
John Matthews earlier in the
show). Their rendition masterly
joins rhythm-based vocals and a

Southern rock slant to put a whole
new spin on the song.

“Quiet,” a primarily acoustic
number (the electric guitar became
bluesy at points), mellowed the now
large crowd. The song contrasted
well to the broken guitar string in-
terlude jams. When strings were

broken and jokes were sparse, the
rest of the band managed
impromptus that arrested the
crowd’s attention. Starting as fa-
miliar bass-lines, these jams soon
creatively branched out and solved
the awkward problem of a broken
string.
