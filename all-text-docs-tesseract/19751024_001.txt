Trustees approve infirmary change

Committee of the Davidson College
Board of Trustees approved a propo-
sal for the renovation of Preyer
Infirmary and a new health-care
program for students.

The proposal, drafted by Dean of.

Students Will H. Terry and based on
the Mc’arland report, calls for
$200,000 in capital improvements to
the existing structure plus an entirely
new staff to operate the new center.

According to Terrry, the college
will hire one physician full-time, and
supplement his services with several
paramedical people and four nurses.

“We're still not changing our basic
philosophy of running the infirmary,”’
Terry added. ‘‘We’re not trying to be
a large hospital providing adequate
medical treatment for our students;
we want to provide first aid and basic
emergency treatment.’’

The present building will be expan-
ded to include a Babcock wing in back
and will be generally modernized
throughout. A new telephone switch-
board to handle emergency and
routine calls, a new kitchen where hot
food can be prepared, a television
ward with a video-beam projector and
screen, and a magazine rack are
planned for the renovated building,
according to Director of the Physical

modern X-ray machine, a pharmacy,
a laboratory, and a small operations
center with an adjoining glass-panel-
led observation-lecture room.

“The observation room is my idea,”’
said Meetze. ‘‘The large glass win-
dows will allow the para-medical
people to look down on the operating
table procedures so they can operate
better during emergencies when the
doctor can’t be there.”’

The para-medical people will be
provided by the Bowman-Grey Medi-
cal School Extension Program.

Davidson pre-meds who have been
accepted early admission at Bowman-
Grey will be eligible for the intern
program.

“Only those students who have §&

scored above 400 on the MedCATS
and have completed Biology 31 or
have permission of the instructor are
thus eligible,’’ said Pre-med Advisor
and Professor of Chemistry James M.
Fredericksen.

Infirmary ills to be remedied: Trustee
committee moves to renovate Preyer
Infirmary and add para-medicals.

Making a pint: Davidson students get shot in
the arm

Students re-register Friday |
Computer fouls course registration

By BILL EDWARDS
Staff Writer

A computer malfunction
late Wednesday night dest-
royed over ninety percent of
the student winter quarter
course registration cards, ac-
cording to Data Processing
Service Manager Kenneth
Carmack.

“Something went haywire
in the master disc of the NCR
Century 101 about 1 AM
Thursday. Apparently, a slip-
ped disc caused the computer
to punch extraneous data at

random on the cards before the
machine processed the first
choice léop.”’

According to Registrar Ric-
hard C. Burts, students will
have all day Friday, October
24 to re-register for winter
term. Only students with al-
pha numbers less_ than
1,097,245 will have to re-regi-
ster.

All students re-registering
will have to pay the $10 late

registration fee. The fee will
help cover the cost of extra
registration forms, computer

Biood drive donors exceed
Davidson donation quotas

By BOB CORLEW

The Davidson Red Cross
Blood Drive collected a record
419 pints of blood Thursday
with the largest number of
contributors ever, according
to Captain William L.
DeVaughan.

“I’m just overwhelmed by
the response this year,” said
DeVaughan. This is the best
turn-out in terms of people
donating and pints collected in
25 years.”

According to the Red Cross,
426 pints were collected at
Davidson in 1950, soon after
the outbreak of the Korean
War.

This year, more than 248
members of the college com-
miinity offered to donate, but
29 were rejected for various
reasons, leaving a record total
of 219 donors.

cards and processing expense.

“We regret that we have to
charge students for this, but
it’s the only way we can keep
students who didn’t register
last week from sneaking in for
free,’’ said Burts.

*‘We also regret that stu-

dents will have so short a’

notice for conferring with fac-
ulty advisors, but if students
are to have courses winter
quarter, we’ve got to finish
re-registration this week.”’

According to Burts, those

who do not complete re-regis-

“Students really came
through for us in the squeeze
during those last hours of the
drive,’’ said DeVaughan.
“Several brought their books
with them and studied for
reviews while they were dona-
ting.

“Unfortunately, some got
so tied up in their studies that
they forgot to call the atten-
dent after giving the first pint.
A few students have reported
adverse side-effects this year
after donating blood.”

Preyer Infirmary Nurse
Dorothy D. Sherrill, R.N.,
reported a slight increase in
traffic among students Friday
and early this week.

Sherrill noted that some 40
students were now occupying
beds in a Charlotte Hospital
after an outbreak of ‘‘mild
depression, fatigue, and lack
of concentration.’’ She re-

tration Friday will be assigned
three courses at random.

“The rules clearly state that
all registration forms must be
in my office by Friday, Octo-
ber 17. Ninety percent of them
aren’t there, and my hands are
tied; I can’t go making excep-
tions to the rules every time an
accident occurs.

“To make things easier for
students and to facilitate the
re-registration process, stu-
dents won’t have to procure
the signature of their faculty
advisor; a friend my substi-
tute,’”’ said Burts.

quested students exhibiting
any of these symptoms to
contact the infirmary im-
mediately.

“This sounds a bit suspi-
cious, and we don’t want to
take any chances. That kind of
thing usually doesn’t happen
unless the needles were dirty,”
said Sherrill.

Several other students have
been confined to the infirmary.
‘*A few have begun to look a
little jaundiced, have devel-
oped some yellow liquid eyes,
and have had difficulties in

Sherrill warned against
hypochondriacs walking to the
infirmary pestering the staff
with minor complaints.

“Some of the major donors
complained of rapid changes in
warts or moles, hoarseness
and coughing, change in bowel
and bladder habits, the needle
puncture in their arms not
healing, unusual bleeding and
discharges, and lumps in their
breasts,” said Sherrill.

“Of course, this is nothing
to worry about. These are
frequent side-effects after don-
ting blood,’’ she said.

keg of beer for the most blood
donated, with 19 students

“‘Students.as a rule give
more than faculty or staff.
Students seem to be more used
to giving blood at Dayidson,’’
said DeVaughan.
