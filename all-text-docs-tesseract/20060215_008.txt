DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

Last Yowl Ever

Mark-Paul Gosselaar, with NYPD Blue co-star and teen heartthrob, Dennis Franz.

For the past two weeks, the
campus has been awash with ban-
ners and fliers requesting student
support for former teen hearthrob
Zack Morris, the main character of
the hit 1990’s television program
“Saved by the Bell.” Morris’ popu-
larity has been a boon for actor
Mark-Paul Gosselaar.

While Gosselaar’s campaign
leaves some wondering exactly
what capacity

inspired many other mediocre tel-
evision stars with dimming
celebrity to pursue self-promotion
on campus as well. Most recently,
fellow “Saved by the Bell” actor
Mario Lopez sprinkled headshots
of himself around various promi-
nent Davidson buildings.

“When I saw what Preppy was
able to accomplish in such a short

Former TV stars dominate Davidson's p

gion major
Henry Bellamy
said that what
Lopez and
Gosselaar are
attempting is

not new.
“Washed up
actors and

! actresses have
a tendency to
> try and contin-
ue their lives in
the public
spotlight
through the
political arena.
That is, if they
choose not to
pursue
pornography,”
Bellamy said.
“Celebrities
treat politics
like their ele-
phant grave-
yard: they go
there to die.”

Bellamy
recounted a number of failing
entertainers who turned to politics
as a means of perpetuating their
relevance, including President
Ronald Reagan, Governors Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Jesse “The Body”
Ventura and late Senator Sonny
Bono.

“When Americans aren’t willing
to entrust a celebrity with the
important job of entertaining us
on the screen, we resign to letting
them entertain us with their politi-
cal views and agendas,” Bellamy
said.

While this winter’s Zack Morris
craze has spread across Davidson
faster than the flu, not everyone
has hopped aboard the “Saved by

the Bell” bandwagon. Cindy
Williams, Associate professor of
Political Science, said that stu-
dents should be more interested in
a candidate’s political beliefs and
experience than their IMDB.com
resume.

“Just because you enjoyed a can-
didate’s acting career does not
mean you have a legitimate basis
to vote for them,” said Dr.
Williams. “As a college, and as a
nation, we need to stop voting on
the basis of celebrity. Floundering
actors don’t belong in various
branches of our political system,
they belong on ‘The Surreal Life.”

Meanwhile, some student politi-
cal hopefuls have replicated
Gosselaar’s formula for success as
well, like newly elected SGA presi-
dent Maria Stanton ’07. Stanton’s
campaign fliers featured pictures
of herself in various school plays,
films and other “homemade pro-
ductions.” .

“I don’t want to say that my
campaign was strictly Morrisian in
its nature,” President Stanton said.
“But there. were certainly aspects
of it that I intended to be at least
Zack-esque. I sincerely believe that
I never would have been elected
had it not been for guest appear-
ances in numerous student plays
and short films.”

Many believe that the ambitions
of Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Mario
Lopez are just the tip of the ice-
berg. The actors who played Jessie
Spano, Mr. Belding and Lisa Turtle
on “Saved by the Bell” have been
seen loitering outside campus
buildings with headshots, resumes
and other promotional material.
Some also report having seen the
cast of “Beverly Hills 90210” and
“Alf.”
