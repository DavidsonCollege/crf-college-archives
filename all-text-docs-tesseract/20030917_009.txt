Don’t hate the owner, hate the

With my New York Yankees (that’s right
Southerners, the Yankees) having just won ten
of their last eleven games, and the impending
arrival of October assuring us of plenty more
victories to come, I’m sure that somewhere
around campus I’ ll soon hear belligerent Braves
fans bashing George Steinbrenner for corrupt-
ing baseball with his unending supply of

cries once the playoffs begin, pitting
the high-rolling Yankees against pay-
roll patsies like the Twins or A’s.

“Steinbrenner’s ruining baseball,”
they’ll cry and cry, gritting their teetht
at the very thought of the moneyed
maniac who runs his team with an iron
fist and rolex-ed wrist. “The Yankees
spend too much durn money!”

_ My response: don’t hate the owner;
hate the league.

With the salary cap system (or lack
thereof) that baseball currently oper-
ates under, it’s obviously not legally
possible to spend too much, and if you (Yan-
kee-haters) can move past your inbred hatred
of pinstripes, you’ll see that it isn t morally
possible, either.

The Yankees have the biggest fan base of
any team in the world, which, coupled with
lucrative television and sponsor contracts,
gives them the most revenue. Wouldn’t it be a
bigger crime if Steinbrenner didn’t spend this
money on his team but instead kept it all to
himself?

of their teams take a back*seat — and show it
(though Steinbrenner clearly makes his ‘fair
share of nfoney). Isn’t he acting as a model
owner by doing everything in his power to
help his team win?

Maybe all the complaints against the Yan-
kees are nothing more than the whining of sore

losers.

Despite my opposition to this whining, how-
ever, I do feel that the Yankees exemplify a
dilemma that desperately needs to be addressed.
They, or any team for that matter, should not
be permitted to spend massive amounts of
money that other teams are clearly unable to
match. Baseball needs a salary cap.

Some people argue that a hard cap causes
players to change teams too frequently, play-
ing for whoever can afford them (see New
York Jets). The current system in baseball is

made out like bandits at this year’s World
Championship in New York. The seven-mem-
ber team collected one gold, silver and
two bronze medals. FYI die-hard fans,
women’s wrestling becomes an Olympic sport

this summer in Greece. .

no different, and I’d much rather see a player
leaving on those terms than abandoning their
team for one that can offer twice as much
money. I still feel guilty whenever Jason
Giambi wins a game for the Yanks.

With sucha strong premium put on scouting
and the minor leagues in baseball, such a cap
probably wouldn’t work. It doesn’t seem right
for a team to have to lose a player
they’ve brought up through the sys-
tem because a salary cap prevents
them from resigning them.

But I don’t see any problems witha
system similar to the one used by the
NBA, which allows teams to exceed
the cap to retain their own players.
That way everyone benefits.

Whoa there, wait a second. Did I
say everybody? I meant everybody
but the players union. Why would
they want to change a thing when a
guy like Raul Mondesi can make $11
million a year? The voices of the fans
were long ago ousted by the green devil on
Donald Fehr’s shoulder.

Don’t expect concessions any time soon
from the guys who use steroid testing as lever-
age in contract talks.

Baseball has far too many problems in dire
need of correction, and the absence of a salary
cap is one of the largest.

Until the league and the players find a
solution, send your complaints in the direction
of The Union and The Commissioner, not The
Boss.
