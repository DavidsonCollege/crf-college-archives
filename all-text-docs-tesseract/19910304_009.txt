Let's Get Nekkid, Boys: Davidson Nudity Explored

By David Smyth

In a purely unacademic dis-
cussign it was once explained to
me that “naked” is what you get
and “nude” is what you are. Get-
tin’s naked (or nekkid, as we are in
the grand old South) also sounds a
lot more fun than (hee hee, blush)
being nude.

People at Davidson get nekkid
for a whole slew of reasons, no
matter what our Puritanical back-
grounds have tried to hammer into
ouronce-malleable psyches: Girls/
Women here get nekkid, but not
always for the same reasons as the
guys/men do. They reserve this
experience for closed doors with
very few other people present to
share the experience. Guys don’t,
always. In fact, sometimes they
revel in the publicity generated by
gettin’ nekkid in the wide open
spaces of our fair campus and cit-
ies far, far away.

Fraternities generate most of
the indecent (or decent, for some
of us) male exposure that pervades
Davidson and other places on
pledge road trips, on which many
chores include gettin’ nekkid at
famous or semi-famous landmarks,
including the Peachtree Plaza in
Atlanta, the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington, DC, and Franklin
Street in Chapel Hill.

A number of Pikas graced the
glass Peachtree elevator two years
ago with their unclad finery. There
was an unforeseen catch in the
plan, though, as the other person in

the rising tube was a non-English:

speaking man who had trouble
understanding the ruckus until
nekkidness was gotten. Lucky for
our schoolmates, charges were not
pressed and no hostile embassies

- were notified of the nekkid ride to

the top.

One sophomore of an anony-
mous house tried to explain the
relative merits of gettin’ nekkid, or
“dropping trow,” on road trips but
was reduced to
a mere, “It’s
just kind of
like, uh...” He
was a little
more helpful
when discuss-_
ing the amount
of gall one
should pretend
to have before
dropping trow
all over the
Southeast.
“The first time
you’re 4 little
bet shy, I guess.
But by the time
Sunday rolls
around, you
wanna getnaked everywhere. You
don’t care,”

His favorite get-nekkid stunt
involved mounting acolossal (100
feet, he claims) billboard on I-85
and dropping trow on top of it.
“Cars were driving by, honking
and stuff. I had to take the picture
so I didn’t climb it. We also got
naked in front of historical land-
marks and stuff.” One birthday suit

dream that went unfulfilled that
weekend was a nekkid drive-thru
of random McDonald’s. No guts
amongst the heralded nudists,
however. The rest of the conversa-
tion included an oft-repeated
refrain,”I don’t think you should
put that in, either.”

Sometimes dropping trow can
land an otherwise innocent naked
college kid in the pokey.

A group from another house
learned as much when they had
that Sunday nekkid fever so nicely
described for us by the helpful
sophomore. These boys were driv-
ing out of Charleston after a par-
ticularly boisterous weekend trip
when they ran into a traffic jam on
I-26.

Seeing the flagman pass cars
along the highway was too much

Seniors Begin Search For Jobs

By Kim Munsterman

“Resumés, cover letters, on-
campus and. off-campus _inter-
views, traveling, buying ‘interview
clothes’...” Senior Sally Christian
lists justa few activi-
ties that may be all
too familiar to many
Davidson seniors on
their quest fora post-
graduation job. Many
seniors report that the
current state of the
economy has ren-
dered this already
difficult task even
more challenging.

Christian has been

viewing for foreign

schools, Although
she will probably not
know whether she
will be offered a job
until May or June, she
senses that therecould
becut-backs andcon-
solidations of teach-
ing positions. She
states, “There seem to
be fewer places to apply and. com-
petition is keener.”

These thoughts are echoed by
other seniors as well. Senior Marc
Crotts has sent out 50resumés, yet
so far has had “no job offers and

plenty of rejections.” He too cites
competition as a main factor in his
difficulties; “The competition at
Davidson has definitely made it
difficult. We are all from similar
backgrounds and after a while we

“definitely a difficult time facing
seniors.” She explains, “With the
economy being at a low point and
many companies closing down,
merging, or cutting back on new
hires, there really are going to be
fewer jobs offe
This is evidenced by
the decreased number
of recruiters coming
to the Davidson cam-
pus and the number
of companies choos-
ing not to visit cam-
puses anymore. Jor-

eral arts colleges are
similarly experienc-

recession.

ofatemptation, though, as the urge
to get one last flash in for the lovely
South Carolinians struck them with
a fury.

As the guys stripped down and
began to help the man with his ar-
duous task, a dues-paying member
of the Bible Belt Nazis Against
Fun tried to run them into the ditch
with his car, a most unfriendly
gesture.

A painful reali-
zation of the
legal ramifica-
tionsof this soon
hitthe pledges as
one of Char-
leston’s not-so-
tolerant finest
decided to run
them in for get-
tin’ nekkid in too
dang much pub-
licity. The story
has a_ scary
middle but a
happy ending as
the jail experi-
ence was theirs
forabout 11 hours
buta sympathetic
jury found them innocent of any

serious wrongdoing and let them ©

off. Noteverybody bares butt from
fraternity coercion, however.
Sometimes it can result from a
severe case of bad judgement, as
happened to two juniors we’ll can
Dummy T and Dummy P (D’you
here that? We’re usin’ code
names!) one fine spring evening
last year.

The story unfolded like this: as

the two watched the UNLV-Duke
game last year, at halftime Dummy
T boldly dared, “If Duke loses by
30 or more, Ill go to class nude.”
Nobody thoughtmuchof hisempty
rhetoric until the rout wound down
and Duke’s deficithovered atabout
30 points.
_ | Atabout this point, T qualified
his reckless former statement by
saying that UNLV could have to
win by exactly 30, or no nekkid-
ness. Also at this time, Dummy P
had his fate inextricably linked to
T’s by saying that he’d get nekkid
with him in case the impossible
happened.

With 10 seconds left, the im-
possible did happen when Duke’s
Crawford Palmer hit one of two
free throws to make it 103-73, and
even 30, and send the Dummies to
class with narry a stitch of clothes.

As T recounted the story, ““We
really couldn’t go toclass nude, so
we ran through the library nude, I
can’t believe that happened... I still
can’t believe that happened.”

Dummies T and P ran through
atunnel of guys from their hall and
made a grand entrance to the first
floor of the E.H. Little Library,
shirts safely over their heads to
protect their fragile egos but not
more strategic parts of their
anatomy. Gettin’ nekkid offers'a
hell of a social outlet for some of
those i in our midst, one that should
notbe taken lightly by well-dressed
students or administrators. Let’s
give ‘em our heartfelt support.

Ethnocentricity is not only
disturbing, it is a dangerous
phenomenon. Take, for ex-
ample, the Gulf Crisis, in
which two men too proud to
make decisions for the benefit
of the multitudes wage instead,
a war in our name. If we could
temper our frustrations, inhale
slowly ten times, pause, listen,
and endeavor to understand the
other, perl:aps we would not
be, at this moment, needlessly
slaying ourselves. Some insist
that war is natural. Some
claim that war is childish.
Children understand the world
with their whole Being; adults
perceive things only with their
minds. Children would never
kill. Perhaps war is adultish.

Ignorance is the cause of
war. We declare our society to
be rational, sane, civilized, and
mature, when small-minded-
ness Clearly prevails. How
then, do the British cabinet
members secretly characterize
all Germans as aggressive,
bullying, domineering, and
possessing of insecurity
complexes? Is this enlighten-
ment? Are our criticisms

criticize most severely those
faults we share with others?
