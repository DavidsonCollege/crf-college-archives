SUPPORT THE UFW

After suffering for ears
under: unspeakable living
‘and working conditions,
America’s farmworkers
came together in the 1960s
to form a union, a union .
that would fight for their
rights and articulate
their needs.

The union was the
United Farm Workers of
America (UFWA), and
under its leadership
conditions improved

the contracts expired last

did their best to destroy
what the workers had built.

to go out on strike. But
men, women and children
manning the picket lines
were met with a massive
campaign of violence and
intimidation forcing them
to withdraw from the
fields and return to the
consumer boycott. But
they need your help to
make it work.

The basic issue in the
