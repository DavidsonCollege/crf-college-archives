FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 19563

As the annual Home-
coming festivities get
underway tonight and
the greatly awaited
combination home-
opener and Homecom-
ing grid scrap comes
up tomorrow the same
old question arises that
has been asked by Da-
vidsonians for the last
twelve years. That
question is, of course,
can the Wildcats turn
the trick and win a
Homecoming football ¢
encounter? The old
Homecoming jinx has

By JOHN HANDLEY

held sway now for twelve years and the Wildcats are hoping
that ’ole jinx number thirteen will be a lucky one this time.

Actually the Cats have lost only 10 Homecoming games
in the last twelve years as there was no football at Davidson
during the war years of 1944 and 1945. Since coming here
as president of the college in 1941, Dr. Cunningham has never
seen a Wildcat team go on to victory in a Homecoming battle.
In the last Homecoming meeting with Presbyterian in 1951
Coach Little was very confident of a win and Dr. Cunning-
ham climbed out on the proverbial limb in predicting a Cat
win. The result—the scrappy Blue Hose sawed off that limb
to thé heart-breaking tune of 14-12.

Centre Colleae Put Hoodoo on Cats
All this Homecoming difficulty began back in 1940 when
the Wildcats took their most recent Homecoming win from
a small Centre college (Kentucky) team by 27-14. The Pres-
byterians from Centre were making their third and last ap-
pearance on a Davidson schedule. The Kentuckians were
famous as the “Praying Colonels” and many an alumni has
been known to remark since that time that the Colonels,
though going down to defeat, left their mark on Davidson
football fortunes in the form of the Homecoming jinx.

During this period of victory “draught” the Cats have
lost some heart-breakers and even some that they were fa-
vored to win. The nearest they have come to a win in this
period was back in 1947 when they managed a tie with a
strong VMI team. Looking at some of the encounters that

were “so close, but not quite” one might include such games

as those against Richmond in 1948 which went to the Spiders,

6-0; Presbyterian-in 1951, 14-12; Furman last year, 14-13. The
Cats got one point closer last year than the year before and
maybe this year will see them turn the trick and give the

victory-starved returning grads a taste of Wildcat win.

PC-Davidson Take Turns Spoiling Homecoming

Last year Davidson beat the Blue Hose by one point,
but romped over them in the statistics department as they
ripped 263 yards out of the Clinton turf. This year’s Cat are
definitely improved and stand in a good position as far as
tomorrow’s game is concerned. Coach Dole is optimistic about
this one, but would offer little more than his usual, ‘We'll

be out there with the idea of winning.”

With the exception of the loss of their captain, Ben Craig,
the Cats stand in good physical shape after three losing
efforts to date and have been drilling hard for tomorrow's

encounter with the Presbyterians. Johnny Gray, the sly States-
ville flash, will be back in the lineup after a slight injury in

the State game last weekend and is expected to play a major

role against the Hose.

Seriously, however, this is no laughing matter as far as
the team and their moral are concerned. The Cats definitely
need this win. This is the year for all good Davidson men to
come to the aid of the team and give them the backing they
deserve and need to clear away this “cloud over Homecom-
ing” and break the jinx of twelve year’s standing. Can 13 be

a lucky number? BEAT PC!

Whittle’s Harriers

Hit Spiders

Yesterday

Coach Pete Whittle’s harriers ran the University of Rich-
mond in a duel cross-country meet yesterday afternoon at

Richmond. Last year Richmond edged Davidson in a close

meet and the Cats were out to revenge that loss.

Homer Sparks, winner of last
week’s meet against Maryville, was
scheduled to lead the locals against
Richmond. Floyd Feeney, Andy
Turner, and Dick Lovette, along
with Bill Shipley were expected
to be right behind Sparks. John
Handley, Joe Caudell, and Larry
Mcintosh made up the remainder
of the team.

Coach Whittle Pleased

Coach Whittle was in high spirits
about the locals’ showing in the
Maryville meet, and seemed not to
expect ‘too much trouble from
Richmond in yesterday's encoun-
ter. Richmond lost the majority of
their better runners of last year’s
team by graduation.

The harriers tied Maryville last
Friday, 26-28. Homer Sparks was
firet, running the four miles in
29:16 minutes. Floyd Feeney, Andy
'v@ener, Dick Lovette, and Archie
Joyner, running fourth, fifth,

Mary, and North Carolina State.
State was last year’s Southern Con-
ference champions and will prob-
ably be Davidson’s toughest com-
petition all season.

After next week’s meet the Cats
meet VMI and W&L in a tri-
angular meet and then they run in
the State, the conference, and the
Carolinas A.A.U meets. The Caro-
lina’s Cross Country A.A.U. meet
is scheduled to be run here on
November 21st.

Stay Unbeaten

After two weeks of inter-fraternity football the Kappa
Sigs and Sigma Chis remain undefeated. It looks as if its

"| going to be a fight to the finish this year as the top four teams

look very good on both offense and defénse.

The results of this week’s games
through Wednesday are as follows:
Sigme Chi 58, Phi Gam 0

The Sigma Chis continued their
winning by defeating the Phi Gams
58 to 0.

Beta 26, ATO 13

The Betas won their first game
of the season by defeating ATO
26 to 13.

SAE 20, CC 0

The SAEs rolled over the Cam-
pus Club, 20 to 0, to win their
second game of the season.

Phi Delta Thete 21, Pi Kapps 0

It was Ish Bennett's running and
passing that led the Phi Delts to
victory over the Pi Kapps. Bob
Southwell was the oustanding
player for the losers.

KA 14, Pikes 13

At half-time the Pikas lead by
Bill Hanna were out ahead of the
KAs 13 to 0. During the third
quarter the KAs scored 7 points
and in the last two minutes of
play Dave McCaw for the KAs in-
tercepted a pass and the result
was a KA victory.

Wildkitten Gridders
Met Furman Today
After Flashy Victory

By BUDDY LILES

. The Davidson freshman football
team met a strong Furman Univer-
sity freshman eleven at 2:45 this
afternoon. The Wildkittens were
seeking their second victory in as
many starts after they downed
McCallie prep eleven in Chatta-
nooga last Saturday by a 20-0 count.

The McCallie encounter saw the
Wildkittens score the first time
they got possession of the ball.
Starting on their own 48-yard line
it took the little Cats only twelve
plays to tally their first TD. With
big Ken Conger taking the ball
over on a five-yard jaunt the Wild-
kittens were never threatened
again. Conger was the leading
ground-gainer of the contest for
the Davidsonians.

Passes Clicked

Don McCree, a standout in ear-
lier practice sessions, made a sen-
sational catch of a Barney Poole
pass in the end zone for the second
six-pointer. Midway in the fourth
period with the visitors leading
13-0, Tommy Newton gathered in
one of Dyke Little’s tosses and
raced 40 yards for the final tally.
Harold Hall added two extra points
in three tries.

Big Gaylord Walker, Newton, and
Hatcher stood out in the big line
of the Kittens. The line, averaging
almost 200 pounds per man, held
the Blue Tornado squad intact and
opened big holes for the Davidson
backs. Jim West's punting and the
passing of Poole and Little were
also highly praised by Coach Ham.

Kappa Sig 65, ATO 0

The Kappa Sigs led by the pass-
ing of Eddie Poe continued their
winning by overpowering the
ATOs. The outstanding players for
the winners were Eddie Poe, Corky
Clark, Hobby Cobb and Corky
Johnson.

Sigma Chi 6, Campus Club 0

The Sigma Chis won by a for-
feit.

Tom Lamb led the Betas to their
second victory of the season, after
dropping the opener to the Pikas,
by defeating the SAEs 26 to 0.

The KAs after losing their
opener to the Kappa Sigs have
come back to win three games.

Cat Frosh Runners
idle After Impressive
Victory Over Pfeiffer

The freshman cross country team
rests this week after taking their
first meet against Pfeiffer Junior
College last Friday. Pete Ashcraft
finishing 12:17.5 minutes after the
starting gun, led his team to vic-

. tory over the strong junior col-

lege squad. His time was only 15
seconds off the freshman cross
country record and chances are
good that he'll break that record
before the season is over.

Phieffer’s number one man
posted a 4:46 first mile, 2 seconds
ahead of Ashcraft, but the fair-
haired freshman soon overcame
this margin to win handily.

Show Improvement

Ted Baker finished -third and
ran well over the entire course.
The team ran well as a téam con-
sidering the fact that this was
their first meet of the season.
With such men as Bondurant and
Huntley who are improving with
every practice and who did well
Friday, along with the one-two
speed punch of Ashcraft and
Baker, the freshmen are develop-
ing into a real threat to any of the
teams they encounter.

Coach Magill remarked after the
Pfeiffer meet that his team as a
whole had shown great improve-
ment and spirit and the will to win.

One surprise of the meet was
the running of Bill Jackson who
finished among the first 10, yet
was not officially running for the
team. Bill did not make the start-
ing team for the first meet, but
has shown tremendous promise
and should be one of the regulars
soon.

The little Cats will be out for
their second win on Friday, Octo-
ber 23, when they travel to the
Pfeiffer home grounds to meet
the same team in a return meet.

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK :

Johnny Gray Stymied
Wolfpack Before Injury

By JOHN HANDLEY
The place: Riddick Stadium in Raleigh; the time: last
Saturday night; the event: the annual Davidson-N.C. State
football game. Put all these ingredients together and you
come out with another shining example of Davidson’s clever
quarterback’s football prowess. The fleet-footed senior from
Statesville we speak of can be only—Johnny Gray.

Win Of Season

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

Davidson's Wildcats join in the celebrating of Homecom-
ing tomorrow when they meet the Blue Hose of Presbyterian
College here on Richardson Field. As in any game that pits
two Presbyterian schools against each other, it promises to be

a close, hard-fought battle.

Presbyterian’s gridders will in-
vade Davidson campus fresh from
last week's startling 7-6 victory
over Wofford’s powerful Terriers.
The Presbyterian line made several
goal-line stands to stave off des-
perate Wofford attempts to stop
the upset.

Homecoming Spoilers

Two years ago, these same Blue
Hose spoiled another Davidson
Homecoming, as they eked out a
thrilling 14-12 decision. Last year,
however, the Wildcats showed the
same courtesy to the Presbyterians
when they edged the Hose 13-12,
in their Homecoming game at
Clinton.

The Davidson eleven will be giv-
ing a little extra tomorrow after-
noon for another reason, too. Since

~?Dr. Cunningham's arrival twelve

years ago, Davidson has not been
able to manage a Homecoming win!
There has been one tie, but the
rest of the games showed the Cats
behind when the final gun
sounded. Last year, the Davidson
team lost a thriller to Furman

University, 14-13.
After First Win

Tomorrow, the Wildcats will be
looking for their first win. of the
current season. They have looked
better in each encounter, and last
week the team gave North Caro-
lina State the scrap of their lives
for three quarters. ‘

State's reserve strength finally
paid off in the final period, and
they scored twice to wrap up the
contest. But the Cats played a
whale of a ball game, and deserve
a lot more credit than the score
indicated.

Coach Bill Dole had nothing but
praise for his team, saying, “The
boys played good football and
looked like a good football team.
The score wasn't indicative of the
game, and the movies show that
with a couple of changes, it could
easily have gone our way.”

“Evenly Matched”

Concerning tomorrow’s game,

Coach Dole says, “Presbyterian has
