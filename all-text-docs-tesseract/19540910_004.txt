Frosh Arrive From
Here To Finland

Davidson, September 9—Acree,
Adamson, Adkins, Alexander, Arm-
strong, and on. The greater part of
246 freshmen are descended on the
Davidson campus yesterday to be-
gin their careers as students in
the 118 year old institution. The
morning was occupied with the
initial steps of registration which
consists of the payment of the reg-
ular college fees for the first se-
mester and the assignment of each
individual to a room in the badly
crowded dormitories.

The over crowded condition on
the campus and in the community
will probably be at its peak except
for the years immediately follow-
ing World War H. With 835 stu-
dents expected before the college
begins its actual class work on next
Wednesday dormitory space is at a
premium. The homes of professors
and other tocal families are being
drafted for use of the college,
wherever this is possible. to alle-
viate the situation.

In many cases the freshmen are
accompanied by their parents, us-
ually their Dads, who produce their
pocket books prepared to settle for
the initial required fees. It is an in-
teresting experience to watch the
neophytes as they approach their
first step in a college education
with a mixture of timidity and awe.

Within the freshmen class all but
two of the original 13 states are
represented. The bulk of the stu-
dents, as in the past, comes from
the south although there is a spat-
tering of. representation from New,
York. New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, and other northern

‘states. The deep south is also well
‘represented as far west as Texas.

Two foreign students will come in
today or ‘tomorrow; Eric Deich.
graeber from Denmark and Pertti
Karkkainen, from Finland.

The alumni reception room was
converted into a registration office,
filled with tables and chairs and
regulated by members of the facul-
ty and student advisors. The Y. M.
C. A. under the guidance of “Y"
Secretary, Sam Magill, has a well
organized program under way to
make it easy for the new comers
to get located and properly orient-
ed to the Davidson environment
which, except for the six lecal stu-
dents represented, is a new exper-
ience and an unfamiliar scene.

Orientation began this morning.
Following the Morning Worship at
8:45, most of the day was consum-

cd with preliminary tests, physical’

examinations, and conferences by
groups with faculty counselors. In
charge of the program was fresh-
men advisor, Hardin King: Dr. J.
H. Ostwalt,’ Director of Counseling
Service: Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr.,
Dean of Students; and Lt. Col.

John D. Sapp, Professor of Military
Science and Tactics of the local
ROTC Unit.

FOR NEW SEASON HERE'S THE LAW!

Coach Pete Whittle’s Wildcat
Harriers will begin workouts in the
next few days to meet what will
promise to be another successful
season for the veteran cross coun-
try and track mentor. Since he has
the services of returning letter-
men Floyd Feeney, Andy Turner,
Dick Lovette, and_Arehie Joyner,
the team has a good nucleus to
build from. A shining star in the
Wildcat crown will be Pete Ash-
craft, who was the champ of the
Southern Conference Freshman
Mile.

A call will go out for prospective
runners in the very near future
and it is emphasized that this is one
sport in which no man is assured of
a berth because of his years with
the team. The top spots on the var-
sity are wide open to the fastest
runner. There will also be a junior
varsity.

The schedule will be:

Oct. 8—Maryville—There.

Oct. 16—Richmond—Here.

Oct. 22-—William and Mary, N. C.
State—Raleigh.

Oct. 30—VMI, Washington and
Lee—Herc.

Nov. &—State Meet—Raleigh.

Nov. 15—Conference — Lexing-
ton, Va.

Nov. 20 — Carolina AAU —Here.
