Faculty salaries. in an era of inflation constitute the
“most serious problem”’ facing Davidson, said College
President Samuel Spencer in interyiews this week.
Spencer cited funding and enrollment as other major

challenges for the 1980's.
Spencer acknowledged that the next ten years will be
a critical period for American higher education. It is
considered likely that inflation and the energy crisis
will lead to escalating costs, while the number of college
age students will decrease. The Chronicle of Higher

Coach Kremser’s
appeal of his

firing rejected

By ROY FULLER

The decision to fire soccer
and track coach Karl Kremser is
final, according to Athletic
Director Thomas Cartmill.

Kremser had appealed the
firing in December. Cartmill
said that after review of Krem-
ser’s appeal ‘“‘the original deci-
sion of denying renewal was
upheld.’’

Kremser was unwilling to
comment, saying that it ‘‘might
jeopardize the situation.”’ He
felt that. ‘‘some things are still
in the works.”

Cartmill refused to give rea-
sons why Kremser was not
renewed, saying that adminis-
trative policy requires him to
refrain from discussing person-
nel decisions.

The criteria for renewal of an
athletic instructor, Cartmill
explained, are ‘‘expertise in the
assigned area, dedication to the
job, and participation in the
department as a professional
individual.’’ When a decision is
appealed, there is a consultation
between the individual depart-
ment and the administration,
followed by the administra-
tion’s formal statement.

According to Cartmill, no
replacement for Kremser has
been found but ‘‘the process is
underway at this moment.”

Reaction from athletes to

Education projects a drop of 21% in the 18-year-old

population of North Carolina over the decade. Other

states are expected to have even greater drops, as high

as 42% in New York. Already, Spencer said, sinking

morale resulting from such gloomy forecasts is a
“major ‘problem i in American colleges.”

Spencer said he is ‘‘deeply concerned’’ about

Davidson’s inability to keep faculty and staff salaries
ahead of the cost of living. ‘‘Inflation is outrunning our
ability to pay,” he explained, admitting that Davidson
has ‘“‘lost ground against public institutions’’ in its
salary levels. However, he pointed out, Davidson is in

Association of University Professors.

Spencer offered no specific proposals on how to deal
with salaries, saying, “If there were a way to keep
faculty and staff compensation ahead of the cost of
living easily and significantly’, other colleges would
have also found it.”

“T plan to come out with some sort of statement on
faculty and staff in the near future,’’ Spencer said.

Richards and Bailey
futures to be
polled on Tuesday

By GLENN KELLUM

~ A straw vote to be conducted ‘Tuesday

_by the Council on Campus and Religious
Life will play an important role in
determining the future of two Patterson
Court houses, currently Richards and
Bailey houses. The houses should be
available for occupancy in September
1981, provided that the Commons has
been completed.

The straw vote will enable the Council
to measure student opinion said Union
Board President Jim Robertson. The
Council, which will submit its sugges-
tions for future use of the houses to
Dean of Students Will Terry, did not
want to make any suggestions ‘in a
vacuum,”’ hence the straw vote, said
Terry.

This straw vote comes at a time when
the problem of overcrowding is very
evident, said Dean Terry. ‘‘There are
just not enough spaces on the Court for
this year’s freshman class. With this
vote the freshmen will be able to create
additional alternatives which aren’t pre-
sently available,’ Terry added. .

The straw vote will appear in the form
of a questionairre. Each student will
circle one of five choices for each of the
two houses: 1) coed eating house, 2)
sorority, 3) all women’s eating house, 4)
fraternity, 5) all men’s eating house. A

’Kremser’s firing has been mixed

Fifteen members of the soccer
team wrote that Kremser had
‘done a truly remarkable job.”
(Davidsonian, 12/14/79) They
pointed out that Kremser im-
proved the team’s record from
0-16 to 8-13 in three years and
was selected Southern Confer-
ence Coach of the Year in 1979.

This high regard of Kremser
is not shared by ‘many soccer
players, according to Kevin
Robbins, three-year captain of
the team. ‘“‘Kremser lacks pro-
fessionalism and discipline,”’
Robbins said.

Robbins disputed the state-
ment from soccer players that
Kremser encouraged a ‘‘self-
respecting team,” saying, “He

from Davidson Student Senate
Athletic Questionnaire

The SGA has finished a study
on. Davidson athletics and is
distributing a quetionnaire to
gauge student opinion on the
subject.

The. Athletic. Committee re-
leased figures . comparing
Davidson's athletic budget to
leges and a
list showing composite GPA’s
for various athletic teams. (See
chart.) Committee Chairman
Jim Haynes said these stat-
istics.should help inform stud-
ents who complete the question-

naire.

The budget survey, compiled
by Committe member Richard
Terry, showed that Davidson
spends more on basketball than
seven similar colleges and more
on football than all but Colgate.

The schools in the survey
were Haverford, University of
the South, Carleton, Williams,
Colgate, St.. Lawrence, and
Wesleyan.

Registrar Richard Burts
worked with the Committee in
figuring composite team
GPA’s, according to Haynes.
Basketball players (with a 2.47
composite GPA) and football
players (2.55) scored lowest in
the study. The Women’s Cross
Country Team (3.35) and Wo-
men’s Track team (3.19) boast-
ed the highest GPA’s.

SGA senators are giving the
study and questionnaire to two
hundred students randomly
selected by computer, Haynes
said. Results will be compiled
Monday.

Noting that faculty and
trustee opinions on the athletics
program are already well-pub-
licized, Haynes said the Com-
mittee ‘‘wanted information on
what students thought.” The
SGA will give results of the
questionnaire to the faculty,
trustees,-and The Davidsonian.

The Committee formulated
the questionnaire after discus-
sion with Athletic Director
Thomas Cartmill, Head. Foot-

‘ball Coach Ed Farrell, Athletic

Advisory Committee Chairman
David Shi, and several students
and faculty members, Haynes

said.

The 25 questions touch on
athletic spending, the impact on
athletics on Davidson social and
academic life, recruitment of
athletes, and alumni support of
athletics.

Haynes said the Committee
was unable to print information
about the Admissions Office’s
handling of athletes’ applica-
tions or the number of athletes
convicted for Honor Code viola-
tions. “We had grand aspira-
tions to get all sorts of informa-
tion,”” Haynes said.

Since some admissions files
examined by the Committee
were incomplete, they decided
their information was too
sketchy to warrant publication
of their-findings.
