Students Abroad

Could Become
Terrorist Targets

College Press Service

The biggest success in higher
education this year - the boom in
foreign study programs - may
become its biggest nightmare.

Some of the 60,000 - 70, 000
Americans studying, abroad this
year could become targets of ter-

rorists in a Persian Gulf war, or at

least find it hard to get home be-
cause of the war. ;

With the onset of war, students
and parents flooded campus study
abroad offices with questions about
their safety.

The concerns, however, have
not translated into trip cancella-
tions, foreign study directors main-
tain.

“Obviously, we have had ques-
tions from parents and students, “
said Gary Johnston, head of the
study abroad program at the Uni-
versity of Arizona. “But as farasI
know it hasn’t affected enroll-
ment.”

“We are seeing a lot of concern
on the part of students and par-
ents,” admitted Jeff Bliss, spokes-
man for Pepperdine University in
California. “But, we’re not seeing
a drop in enrollment. In fact, all
programs are filled to capacity.”

Pepperdine students and pro-
fessors, along with those of six
other U.S. universities with pro-
grams in Florence, Italy, recently
received nearly identical letters
threatening them with reprisal if
the United States went to war with
Iraq.

Students and faculty from
Georgetown, Syracuse, California
State, Florida State, and the Uni-
versity of Michigan also received
the threats.

Italian authorities investigat-
ing the group, which calls itself the
“Secret Popular Revolutionary
Movement,” advised the students
tokeepa low profile, even thought
they believe it was a hoax.

“At this point, they don’t know
if it was serious or not,” said State
Department spokeswoman Nyda
Novodvorsky. “They’re inclined
to think it’s a hoax. Of course, we
haven’t invaded Iraq; either,” she
noted four days before the United
Nations deadline.

In April, 1986, following the
U.S. bombing of Lybia, numerous
colleges, including Stephens, St.
John’s, Bates, Yale, and Union

_College, cancelled all or part of

their summer abroad programs.

.Business and leisure travelers,
if not students, sharply curtailed
trips to the Middle East and Eu-
rope during the first two weeks of
January. Many of those who did
go switched from U.S. airlines,
travel observers said.

Advanced bookings for Euro-
pean Travel, for instance, have
dropped 25 to 50 percent in recent
weeks, reported Roger Ballou, of
American Express’s Travel Re-
lated Services Group. Officials
there cite security concerns as well

| Religion Professor Says Muslim

Concept Of Evil Supports Iraqui Rage

Saddam Hussein may fall to
allied forces, but the bitter resent-
ment many Iraqis feel against
America may endure for genera-
tions to come - and with renewed
religious fervor, says Bill Mahony,
a Davidson College associate pro-
fessor of religion.

Mahony believes that Ameri-
cans must become more aware of
the religious dimensions of this
crisis in order to reduce the long
term number of casualties.

Islamic faith views history as
revealing an ongoing struggle be-
tween good and evil. Many Mus-
lims in Iraq and neighboring re-
gions have come to associate the
United States with the evil forces,
a fact that most Americans don’t
understand.

“Viewing events from this deep
set vision of a dualistic world, the
people of the regionare.not.neces-
sarily going to respond to Ameri- ©
can military actions by surrender-
ing immediately,” he said at a re-
cent campus gathering. “They are
likely to straighten their backs even
more and continue in their anger
long past any political resolution.”

Mahony has published many
articles on world religions and

served as an editor of the “Ency-
clopedia of Religion.” He has
studies and taught Islam, the faith
of 95 percent of Iraqi people, for
18 years:

He says the reasons behind the
rage against the West in general
and Americain particular lie in the
history and religious views of this
land. From their forbears, Mus-
lims inherited an essentially pessi-
mistic world view. “Babylonians
and Mesopotamians who live in
thearea that is now Iraq deeply felt
a lack of control over their envi-
ronment from the beginning,”
Mahony said.

“They saw the after life as being
radically different from the pres-

‘ent,” he said. “One of the ancient

Mesopotamian prayers illustrates
this view: “May tomorrow be better
than today.’

“The presentanger also emerges
from the long history of the region
since the Crusades. From the Is-

of view, the. West has
feegeny. aad and at times violently,

told the Arab nations what to do,”
Mahony said.

“Tf you look at a map of the
region you see all the boundaries
are straight lines that were drawn
by the British and the French. But
for many centuries this Islamic -
Arabic area was the most accom-

plished and civilized in the world,
so they suffered a great feeling of
indignation at being cut up by
European colonial powers.

“Although I see important reli-
gious dimensions in this crisis,”
Mahony said, “the problem is not
primarily religious in nature, but
political and economic.” ;

The most frequently;y men-
tioned cause for anti-American
feeling is U.S. support for Israel,
but Muslims also view the wealth,
power and success of the United
States as deadly temptations from
outside leading them away from
God.

For many, the balance of power
as it now stands is truly evil and
unacceptable, for it means the
domination of nonbelievers over
the faithful, resulting in the cor-
ruption of religion and morality in
society.

Iraqis may also support 'Hassein
out of a long tradition of undying
loyalty to their leader, or “shaykh.”

‘Following the’ example“of their

Bedouin Arab forbears, the Iraqis
look to their leader to insure their
survival before the world’s threats
and dangers.

As Muslims, the Iraqis may be
more willing to fight against an

Faculty Housing Project
Threatens McConnell Pond

By Tom Koonce
While the Davidson-Comelius
area has experienced rapid growth
over the past few years, there has
been a steady drop in available
housing in this part of Mecklenburg
County.

Because of families looking for
housing away from Charlotte, new
businesses, and projects such as
River Run, the going market rate
for land and houses in Davidson
has skyrocketed.

Now, as new Davidson faculty
search for affordable houses, they
are forced to look to places in
Mooresville and other locations
outside the town. For a college
that prides itself in having most of
its faculty and staff live nearby,
this caused a problem that had to
be addressed.

In response to this growing

concern, the President appointed a-

Housing Task Force to find a solu-
tion to this Davidson housing
crunch.

The Task Force sent out ques-
tionnaires to the faculty and began
considering alternatives and po-

tential sites for new faculty hous-
ing.

They looked at campus prop-
erty behind Erwin Lodge on Grey
Road and areas along Concord
Road. The area behind Grey Road
is already campus property. The
committee decided not to commit
this property to housing because of
possible future campus expansion
in this area.

The group concluded that prop-
erty off of Concord Road was the
best land for housing. They chose
an areaknown as McConnell Pond.
It begins just after the last house on
the left as you leave town on Con-
cord Road.

The area was bought by the
college back in the 1950’s with the
intent of using it for future faculty
and staff housing. In fact, fifteen
years ago, plans were deawn up ic
develop the land.

On this 98 acres of what was
once pasture land but now is over-
grown, there is a small pond. This
pond has been used quite frequently
in study by the biology depart-
ment. Some in the department are

against this natural area being
overrun by development.
According to Biology Profes-
sor David Grant, such a develop-
ment, “Would bea beautiful place,
but it (the pond) has something of
everything biologically.”
Dr. Grant has spoken out against
the project, citing the needs of the
Biology Department for sucha field
