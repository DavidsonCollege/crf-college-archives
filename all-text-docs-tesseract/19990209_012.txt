Casner, Bradford, & company turn i in ‘awesome’ performance

By ALIson KALETT

The women’s tennis team earned
their first win of the season in exciting
fashion on Saturday. The Wildcats (1-

(Middle Tenn. St.__4

1) defeated Middle Tennessee State
(MTS) 5 matches to 4 in a contest that
came down to the final doubles match
of the day. ’

Heading into the last doubles match
the ‘Cats and MTS were tied at four
matches each. Amber Bradford, the
#2 singles seed, won a tough three-set
contest 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, while her team-
mates #4 seed freshman Forbes Th-
ompson and #6 seed senior Kirstyn
Leuner also earned victories. In the
othertwo doubles matches the #2 seeded
team of seniors Claire Cheatwood and
Leuner defeated MTS 8-3, while the #3
duo of Thompson and senior Clara
Marks won by default.

With the match even at four wins

per team, the stage was set
for the deciding match which
pitted the ‘Cats #1 doubles
team of seniors Dana Casner
and Bradford against Jenni-
fer Bryans and Alex Toelle
of MTS.

In collegiate tennis,
doubles matches are typically
played as pro sets rather than »
the standard best two out of ©
three sets format which is
used in singles. In a pro set
the first team'to win 8 games
by at least a 2 game margin
takes the match.

The ‘Cats got out to a
solid 6-3 lead, but MTS re-
fused to fold and eventually
tied the match at'7. With
their teammates cheering on
the sideline, Casner and
Bradford won the next two
games to claim the match 9-
7, the overall victory, and the
team’s first win of the sea-
son.

“Everyone was so sup-
portive and cheering and yell-
ing,” Casner said. “It was
good to get the first win un-
der our belt.”

Price was extremely pleased
with her team’s performance and
the high caliber of tennis that
was played. “The match was
awesome,” Price said. “Casner
and Bradford were mentally
tough and made big plays to
secure the win.”

The Wildcats’ victory
against MTS was their second
match of the season. On Friday,
they took on ACC powerhouse
Georgia Tech in a match that
Price said gave her team a lot of
momentum and propelled them
to their win against MTS.

Although the ‘Cats fell 6
matches to 1, the top seeds en-
joyed competitive matches. At
#1 singles Casner won the first
set in a tiebreaker 7 points to 3
and came very close to claiming
either of the next two but even-
* tually fell 7-5 and 6-4. At the #2
spot, Bradford earned
Davidson’s lone victory of the
afternoon by bouncing back from
a 0-6 first set loss to defeat Sybi
Parker of Georgia Tech 6-4, 6-
3 in the last two sets.

Bradford was the player of
the weekend for the ‘Cats as she
won three out of her four matches

including the impressive win over Geor-
gia Tech,

Despite the loss to Georgia Tech,
the ‘Cats are still on track to achieve
what Price named as their three top
goals for the rest of the season, namely:
atop- ten regional ranking, a slot among
the nation’s 100 best teams, and ulti-
mately a Southern Conference champi-
onship. Last season, Davidson lost in
the tournament semi-finals to eventual
champion Furman University.

“We have a talented, competitive
conference,” Price said. “There are six
teams that can win and Davidson has a
legitimate shot.”

Leading the ‘Cats this season will
be five seniors: Dana Casner, Amber
Bradford, Claire Cheatwood, Clara
Marks, and Kirstyn Leuner. “One of the
keys is the leadership of these seniors,”
Price said. “They can have an impact on
and off the court and their contributions
are significant.”

Freshman Forbes Thompson of
Raleigh, N.C. will also be looked to for
solid contributions at the #4 singles
position.

Looking ahead, Davidson will host
a doubles tournament this Saturday
against James Madison University and
conference rivals Wofford and East
Tennessee State.

Men’s basketball team exacts revenge on UNCG

Walter Weckler once said, “Re-
venge has no more quenching effect on
emotions than salt water has on thirst.”

- - Perhaps

UNCG _69

Katie Sanderson

Weckler would have reconsidered this
declaration had he been in attendance at
Belk Arena on Saturday, where the
Wildcats ruthlessly exacted some sweet
revenge on the UNC-Greensboro squad
that upset the ‘Cats 73-67 back on Janu-
ary 11. ’

Powered by a 17-0 run in the first
half, Davidson pounced to a 56-27 half-
time lead that ultimately
eventuated in a 101-69 vic-
tory.

The Wildcats de-
livereda nearly flawless first-
half performance, knocking
down 21 field :goals on 19
assists while forcing 16 turn-
overs and committing but
four of their own.

Effective  ball-
movement and control sur-
gically picked apart
Greensboro’s defensive
lines. “We’re distributing
the basketball and making
very good decisions,” praised
Coach. Bob- McKillop. “I
think it had a lot to do with
the unselfishness of our play-
ers and the decision-making
of our players.” Davidson
made more first-half field
goals than their foes at-
tempted.

On the other end of
the floor, Davidson effec-
tively subdued Greensboro’ s

offensive efforts and turned those de-
fensive stops into offensive opportuni-
ties of their own. “We’re starting to
manufacture points from our defense
which is a great sign of maturity and a
great sign of growth,” McKillop said.

For eight minutes in the first half,
UNC-G failed to score a point. Only an
act of divine (read: referee) interven-
tion rescued the Spartans from their
first-half flat spin—controversial foul
on a three-point shot attempt was fol-
lowed by a technical foul called on an
infuriated Bob McKillop. Greensboro
knocked down four of the five ensuing
free throws to break their scoring
drought. It took the Spartans almost
seventeen minutes to reach the elusive
20-point total. °

Ali Ton served his role of the
team’s point guard to perfection—
notching 11 assists, 5 steals, and not a

_ Single turnover. McKillop wondered in

bewilderment, “How many guys have
had a college game like that in their
entire life?”

Sophomore Emeka Erege-con-.
tributed 13 points and 5 assists on the
evening while sparkling on the defen-
sive end of the court. Said McKillop,
“This was Emeka’s best performance
as a Davidson Wildcat. Bar none.”

Six Wildcats (Erege, Landry
Kosmalski, Stephen Marshall,
Michael Bree, Ben Ebong, and Chadd
Holmes) pitched in double digit point
totals. Two more, Brian Turner and

Davor Halbauer, added 9 and 8 points
respectively. The Wildcats are now the
top-scoring. offense in the Southern
Conference. “We’re a high-octane of-
fense,” McKillop asserted.

For the fourth consecutive game,
the Wildcats shot better than 50% from
the field. Three different Wildcats
brought the crowd to their feet with
thundering slam dunks —Ebong,
Turner, and Halbauer (yes,
Davor Halbauer).

But the biggest ova-
tion of the evening be-
longed to Ben Ebong, and
it was earned before he even
touched the basketball. The
6’7” senior returned to the
lineup part way through the
first half after missing five
consecutive games with a
sprained back. Ebong then
contributed 12 points and 4
rebounds in just 16 min-
utes. i

With just seconds re-
maining in the- game, de-
fensive pressure on a
Greensboro inbound at-
tempt forced the Spartans
tocallatime-out they didn’t
have. Davidson was
awarded two technical free
throws, and Michael Bree ™
hit them both to send the
‘Cats over the century mark 5
for the first time in confer-

ence play this season.

The win assured Davidson their
sixth straight winning season, and con-
tinued the Wildcats’ awesome success
in the month of February. The ‘Cats are
now 27-1 over the last four Februarys:
8-0 in °96, 7-1 in ’97, 9-0 in ’98, and
now 3-0 in ’99.
