Netters Contend For Tourney Crown

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Managing Editor

The Davidson tennis team
crushed UNC-Charlotte 8-1, to
take a thrust of momentum in-
to the Southern Conference
Tournament this weekend in
Boone, N.C.

The win placed the Cats at a
15-10 mark for the season.
They finished 5-2 in the con-
ference, good enough for third
place behind Appalachian, the
host of the tourney, and Fur-
man.

Head coach Jeff Frank is
looking toward the tour-
nament with optimism, but
admits that the going will be
tough.

‘‘We would really have to
get a fantastic draw on Thur-
day night to have a good shot
at the title,"’ he commented.
“But we have been playing
good tennis the past couple of
weeks and could definitely
pull some big upsets.’’

Estimating where his
players will be seeded, Frank
is holding his breath for Bill

Pete Celentano

Allen to get the fourth spot at
the top singles position. He
feels that Rick Quinby and
Gary Bressler will be either
third or fourth at the second
and third singles, respec-
tively. Scoot Dimon will
probably not be seeded at the
fourth spot, while Steve
Holman and John Mitchell
should both be third in the fifth
and sixth slots, respectively.

The doubles look like Allen
and Quinby getting the second
seed at the top doubles, with
Bressler and Jim Dorsett
being third or fourth. Holman
and Bill DuPont should get the
fourth seed at the third
doubles.

“I am really expecting
everyone to make it through
the first round, unless we get
screwed in the pairings,”’
Frank explained. ‘‘Then it is
just a matter of how many
brackets we are in with Ap-
palachian and how many with
Furman.’’ The Cats were
beaten 9-0 by the Moun-
taineers earlier this season.

Frank noted that Mitchell
was playing very good tennis
at the number six spot, as was
Quinby. He also felt that
Bressler was playing back to
normal after being in a brief
slump.

“I think we are as ready as
we will ever be,”’ Frank ad-
mitted cautiously. ‘‘We
probably could not be any
more ready if we had three
more weeks to prepare.”’

He continued by saying the
doubles look to be the best
places for the Cat as far as the
tournament is concerned. He
is especially confident in the
number one position, where he
feels the team is likely to get
to the finals and maybe win
the championship. He also
feels the chances are good in
the number two doubles,
although a good draw is once
again a necessity. .

Recently the Cats have ad-
ded to their wins with victories
over Atlantic Christian and
East Carolina.

Those matches were won by

Gimmicks Fail In Pro Track,
Folger Seeks Ultimate Fungo

If you stayed up late the
night of April 14, you might
have seen the ITA track meet
from Los Angeles.

I don’t know why, but I just
can't get excited over
professional track. Even aside
from the inane commentary of
Charlie Jones, Bill Toomey
and Paul Warfield, the meet
seemed to lack that spark of
pure competitiveness, free of
any material gain, which is
the essence of sport.

Another repulsive factor is
the extensive use of gim-
mickry. Is it really exciting to
watch a 250 Ib. shot-putter run
a 30-yard dash against a 110 lb.
female sprinter? Is it more ex-
citing to watch men run
against each other rather than
against ‘‘pace lights’’?

One of the stranger per-
sonalities on the Davidson
College baseball team is one
Ruben Franklin Folger,
resident story-teller
(specifically ‘‘Hamlet
stories’) and self-proclaimed
fungo champion of the
Southern Conference and
possibly the world.

Frank is a short and middle-
relief man who is commonly
known as a ‘‘junk’’ pitcher,
i.e. he can’t throw the ball
straight.

He’s had a pretty fair year
so far in the pitching depart-
ment. This is not the story of
his pitching but of his hitting.

Like most pitchers, Frank is
a frustrated hitter. He
believes that he could tear the
cover off the ball if he could
only get the chance. A
traditionalist, Folger hates
the new designated hitter rule,
mostly because he no longer
get a chance to hit.

Even this rule does not stop
Frank from trying to prove
that he is the reincarnation of
Babe Ruth. He vents his
frustration by hitting fungoes.

For the uninitiated, a fungo
bat is longer, thinner and
lighter than an average
baseball bat, allowing one to
hit a ball a maximum height
and distance with a minimum
of effort.

The Folger Theory of hitting
fungoes states that if one puts
all his effort into hitting these
fungoes, he can propel a
baseball a phenomenal distan-
ce.

It is this last assumption
which drives Ruben Franklin
Folger in his quest for the
“Ultimate Fungo’.

Go to a ball game about half
an hour early and you'll see
Frank standing on the left
field line, grunting with each

mighty heave as he tries to |

‘‘jack one out”’.

Frank has had some definite
success in his quest. I saw him
propel one about 380 feet at
William and Mary. Here at
Davidson he'll occasionally
rocket one out.

Frank discounts whatever
success he’s had so far
because he says he's been
using inferior equipment.

“Give me a_balsa-wood
fungo bat and a brand new
rabbit ball, and I'll really
show you something,’’ he
says.

You know something, I
believe him.

scores of 6-3 and 9-0, respec-

Against High Point College
at the Panters home courts
Tuesday, the Cats suffered a 5-
4 defeat. Frank felt the team
did not play well and at-
tributed this to both the Pan-
ters’ toughness and the Cats
“looking to the tourney”’ this
weekend.

The Cats lost four of the six
singles. Then they won the
number one doubles and the
third doubles before the
second doubles team roped a
4-6, 6-0, 7-5 decision after being
up 5-3 in the third set, having
the service and having two
match points.

Frank is getting his team in
shape for the tournament

which begins on Friday and

and worse with this

will conclude on Saturday.
One big disadvantage will be
that the tourney will be on the
Apps’ home courts and on
hard courts.

But the Cats are ap-
proaching the event with quiet
optimism. As defending con-
ference champions, they are
in a very precarious situation.
They do not really have
anything to lose.
