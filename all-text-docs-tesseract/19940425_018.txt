Baschall loses a close one to ACC's Wake Forest

By David Dwyer

Davidson’s baseball team
faced a strong team Tuesday after-
noon in the Wake Forest Demon
Deacons. After holding the lead
for much of the game, the Wildcats
blinked first in what had become
quite a staring match, giving up
two runs in the eighth inning and
eventually losing 9-7. In yet an-
other game that demonstrated
Davidson’s offensive weapons,

Wake succeeded in keeping the
game close until they could grab
the victory at the last possible op-
portunity.

The Deacons drew the game’s
first blood, blasting back-to-back
home-runs off Davidson starter
Jonathan Coulombe in the top of
the first. Davidson recovered
quickly, however, getting one RBI
in the bottom of the first off the bat
of catcher Brett Boretti, and three

more in the bottom of the second
behind Drew Fassett’s homer and
Chad Blackwelder’s triple. By the
seventh inning, Wake Forest had
taken the lead 7-5, but Davidson
wasn’t quite finished. DH Brad
Edwards doubled in two runs to tie
the game heading into the eighth
inning. Wake, however, got two
runs in the top of the eighth and
then held Davidson scoreless for
their final two at-bats to preserve

the victory.

The Wake game paralleled
much of Davidson’s season. The
Wildcats have lost 13 games by
margins of two runs or less, which
indicates competitiveness but an
inability to win the close games.
Still, it is likely that Davidson will
enter the conference tournament
as the seventh seed. The Wildcats
hope to prove themselves as not
only competitive but also as one of

the conference’s best.

Inother action, sophomore Jeff
Andrews threw a five-hitter in the
second game of Saturday’s double-
header at Marshall, giving
Davidsona split with the Thunder-
ing Herd (21-18). Davidson lost
the first game 21-18 but recovered
to win the second 7-3. Center-
fielder Jazz Frietas pushed his hit-
ting streak to 17 games as he closes
in on Jeff Andrews’ team record.

dents would. . . participate if the
opportunity was there.”

Five years ago, Davidson es-
tablished nine full athletic scholar-
ships for women to meet standards
required by Title 9. Women’s ath-
letics decided “to spread the money
among the entire program, not just
to one sport,” adds Martin.
Women’s tennis was considered a
premier sport and received one and
a half full grants, while field
hockey, track/cross country and
soccer were each allocated one full
grant.

“The college funded men’s
scholarships are still, however,
designated solely for basketball,
and it would take trustee policy to
change that,” says Holland.

Even with the changes inspired
by Title 9 and the partial scholar-
ships funded by the DAF, most
Davidsonathletes, other than men’s
basketball players, must depend
primarily on need-based aid to fi-
nance their educations.

Holland’s justification for the
continued imbalance of athletic
scholarships in favor of men’s bas-
ketball, despite the increased popu-
larity of other sports, especially
soccer, is that “historically, it’s

been there.”

With a lack of season ticket
sales; Davidson risks a change in
divisions. According to Holland,
Davidson currently continues to
play Division I despite the finan-

cial strain and the lack of financial °

resources to compete for players
with other Division I schools be-
cause, “Historically, we have been
Division I, and the people we com-
pete with for students are Division
I. We are located in an area with
not many schools like ourselves
with which to compete.” Of the
top 25 liberal arts colleges in the
country, Davidson is the only Di-
vision I school.

Divisions are set institution-

ally; thus, Davidson must play
Division I in all sports or in none.
Division III football is an excep-
tion because it received a geo-
graphical waiver in order that it
might play members of the Divi-
sion Ill Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.
“Tf the financial strain became
areal strain, our first step would be
tocut scholarships,” says Holland.
Davidson would then have to see
“if we can compete without schol-
arships.”
A change in divisions would
alter the opportunities for scholar-

ships, especially for men’s basket-
ball, where nearly the entire team
-is ona full ride, because the NCAA
allows fewer scholarships in Divi-
sion II and none at all in Division
Il.

Players in these leagues must
depend fully on need-based aid. A
faculty committee concerned about
the amount of funds allocated to
athletics found that Davidson’s
scholarship funds are already at a
Division Il level.

A change of divisions and -
fewer full athletic scholarships
would inhibit the recruitment pros-
pects and greatly affect the nature
of the entire athletic program.
“There are student-athletes who
want to come to Davidson but
choose to go where they can get a
full scholarships instead,” says
Holland:

Providing nearly 60 full ath-
letic grants is necessary for re-
cruits to view Davidson as viable
option among Division I schools;
however, Davidson's tuition is so
much higher than other Division I

b

schools that providing that many
full rides is very difficult.

Holland comments, “A state
school could give four full schol-
arships to every one scholarship at
Davidson.”

Davidson’s difficulty com-
peting in recruitment extends to
both athletes and scholars and is
attributed to an overall lack of
scholarship funds,

Says Holland, “This problem
is not just in athletics but school-
wide; that’s why the campaign is
focusing on providing merit schol-
arships.”

“If we had the opportunity to
participate in aleague with schools
that do not give scholarships, we
would have done so, but people are
not willing to give it up unless they
have to.”
