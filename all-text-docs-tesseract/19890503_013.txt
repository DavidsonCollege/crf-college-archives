The furious rumors of the last few weeks were confirmed early this
week. Yes, Trump University, there is a Santa Claus, and he’s bringing

us Terry Holland!

One of the two “glory coaches” of Davidson’s storied basketball past, Holland was
nastily snatched away by the University of Virginia several years ago. But now he’s ready
to return as the new athletic director and head basketball coach for Trump University.

“T think the new Sports Com-
plex is just so pretty,” said Hol-
land’s wife, reached at their home
in Charlottesv... uh, Charlest... uh,
Charlo... ah, Virginia earlier this
morning. “Allofthose long-haired,
sweaty, tanned gorgeous workers
really turned me on. I’m sure that
[the complex] was a factor in
Terry’s decision as well.”

In a bizarre deal involving money and stomach holes...

“The fact that I have a hole in
my stomach is one factor,” said
Holland. “I just wanted to come
back to a situation where there is
not so much pressure and contro-
versy associated with the Athletic
Department. “*

Holland’s recent ulcer prob-
lemshave sparkedconcerm that the

flow of leaks from the athletic
department may not cease, but
Holland said his condition is under
control.

He would notcommenton the
recent purchase of Davidson by
Donald Trump, but did say he was
expecting a huge salary increase.

David’s Onion _ star

captured point-guard Alan
Hunter seconds before his
head wads brutally intercepted
by Big Hand and forced down

is throat.

Members of the team were

shocked. “It all happened so fast,”said _

teammate MoGray. “By the time Alan
saw it coming, it was too late.”

“Tt was awful,” wailed one fan
momentsafter the tragedy. “Swee’pea
let out-a horrible shriek and then his

head just disappeared! Ican'tgetridof —

the image...Alan’s body running
around in his #22 uniform...
HEADLESS! I've never seen a hand
so monstrously big!”

“T like thinking big,” Trump said,

_ trying to console the fan. “If you’re

going tobe thinking anyway, youmight
as well think big!”

Trump University right up there in
the top ten,” he claimed.

Asked whether he would be
able to recruit as well at a small
Southern, liberal arts college,
Holland replied, “It’s actually the
other way around. Ralph Sampson
was an Okay player, and Richard
Morgan is decent, but I just have-
n’t had the calibre of players at
Virginia that I had at ...”
AHHHHH!!!!

TOO INCREDIBLE: Wait a minute!
NOTE TO EDITORS: I'm sorry, but I
just can’t keep this up. We’ ve got some
pretty damned far-fectched stories in
here, but this is just too much. A spoof
issue is one thing, and it’s a good idea,
but this is ridiculous. Nobody is going

to be fooled in the least by this story.
Print this big, idiotic piece of crap if
you want, but don't expect anyone to
read it.1 askedMr. Trump first, andhe
said, “I like thinking big. If you're
going to be thinking anyway, you might
as well think big.”

Athletic Director Christopher B. “I taut Isaw

_ aPuddy-tat” Morris resigned when he learned of

Donald Trump’s hostile takeover.

Morris cited “philosophical differences” between himself
and the school’s new owner as the motivating force behind
his decision. He admitted, however, that the chance to hit the
PGA tour had a slight influence on his choice.

“It’s time to take my clubs
elsewhere,” said Morris with only
a slight tinge of regret.

Leading athletic-directors-
turned-pro-golfers expert San D.
Pit predicts that Morris would have

~ asuccessful career. “I would have

Kit Morris, athletic director.

to predict that Morris will have a
successful career,” he said.

Morris wished his successor,
Terry Holland, the best of luck
next year. “But this sure ain’t the
place to get relief from ulcers,” he
added.

Kit Morris, relaxed and relieved
PGA golfer!
