As FELIX Sees

"Em

By LAMONT BROWN

April showers descended upon this sec-
tion in more ways than one last week
with plenty of rain plus a_ veritable
deluge of celebrities who carried on a
busy sports program in spite of the fact
that Old Man Sunshine failed to put in
an appearance.

A whole army of veteran sportsmen
barged into the Charlotte Hotel lobby
to cause no little neck-stretching, while
ye Ed. scurried about in a manner rem-
iniscent of the gold rush in an attempt
at interviewing.

Connie Mack and his Athletics
suffered the first attack. When
asked about his team’s chances for
the pennant, the 73 year old vet-
eran replied that he expected his
club to be a strong contender but
as to what place the athletics will
hold down in the league “that’s
something I can’t answer.’ Con-
nie added that they were passing
through from Florida on the way
to big league action. Questioned
as to the whereabouts of his son,

a former Blue Devil hurler, he

replied that he was ‘‘working with

the Athletics.”

Jimmy Foxx, Handy Andy of the

Athletics, warded off autograph seekers

long enough:to say that his exhibition in

Charlotte was just “an off day.”

George Lott, greatest doubles

player in the world, came in for
a small share of interviewing,
stating that Tilden, Vines, Nus-
slein, and himself would leave the
next day for Raleigh. The old
warhorse, “Big Bill’ Tilden, em-
phatically stated that he intended
to continued his career until he
was “bored.”

Other luminaries were able to evade
Felix, who, receiving’ word that war
clouds were looming up in the old home
town, returned to reconnoiter.

Finding a win over Mich, State and a
defeat at the hands of Lenoir-Rhyne on
record, Felix entertained some doubt as
to the outcome of the Carolina contest,
but two extra innings saw some of the
most gratifying ball ever played any-

. where near Richardson Field.

Jim Morgan, local King of
Swat, continued a record that
would do credit to any man’s
team, while Charlie Harris exer-
cised some of the finer points of
the game, allowing only 4 hits and
striking out 11 men. Jim Dick-
son brought in the winning run for
the second time this season.

The track team enjoyed a hectic past
week-end, leaving here last Friday for
Richmond, where“after several hours of
splashing around in the university’s own
mud, they were awarded a very short
end of the score.

Mackorell Is Tendered
Pro Football Contract

Johnny Mackorell, Little-All-Ameri-
can quarterback of Davidson College,

has been offered a tempting-contract with
the world professional champion New
York Giant team, it was learned Satur-
day, April 6.

Dr. Harry March, known as_ the
father of professional football, who is
a Giant scout, made a special trip to
Davidson to sign the Davidson Dynamo,
and, being unsuccessful, left the contract
with Johnny Mackorell.

It is known that Uncle Charlie Moran,
famous National League umpire and vet-
eran coach and professional football
player, recommended Mackorell to Dr,
March, an old-time friend.

Uncle Charlie, some time ago, told a
group of friends that Johnny Mackorell
was the type to succeed in big-time pro
football and that he possessed the ability
to become a star. Johnny is in all-
around player. He is a fine defensive
man, and blocks, passes, runs and kicks
well. His weight, around 190 pounds,
appealed to the Giant scout who rounded
up Ken Strong, Ed Danowski, Harry
Newman, Bo Molenda, Dale Burnett,
and many other backfield aces, for the
New York Giants.

Mackorell says that he hasn't given
the contract much consideration and, at
the present, he doesn't think he will ac-
cept.

Baseball scouts, too, already are look-
ing him over. Herb Pennock and Fred
Hunter of the Charlotte Hornets Friday
passed an approving eye over Johnny,
who is a third baseman, Pitcher Charlie
Harris and Outfielder Jim Morgan of

Cat Golfers Lose

In Four Contests

Snow, Ross, Cowan, Hamrick,
And McClelland Return
“ After Southern Trip

Five Davidson golfers returned Thurs-
day from a week's campaign of the links
of South Carolina, Georgia, and Flor-
ida. The team encountered Furman,
Georgia Tech, University of Florida, and
the College of Charleston.

The first match was with Furman at
Greenville. The South Carolinians were
in better form than the Wildcats and
managed to eke out a 101%4-7% victory.

The next stop was Atlanta, where
Georgia ‘Tech, one of the most pow-
erful collegiate golf teams in the coun-
try, furnished the opposition. The Jack-
ets, with their famous combination of
Charley Yates and Berrien Moore,
proved to be much too strong and copped
a 17-1 verdict.

Florida was next met at Gainesville.
The boys of the Sunshine State were a
quartet of clever club wielders and were
victorious in all six matches. The point-
a-match system of scoring was used,
making the final count 6-0 in favor of
the Floridians.

On thé return trip to Davidson the
College of Charleston was faced on the
wind-swept links of South Carolina’s fa-
mous coast city. Here it was too much
Lewis Johnson and Thad Street and the
Maroons won out 13-5. Street and John-
son, both prominent in southern amateur
circles, were “right with the card” to
defeat Davidson's first combination. The
team returned to school after this match,
arriving late Thursday night. The trip
was made by Snow, Charley Ross, Cow-
an, Hamrick, and Ralph McClelland.

Richmond University won a muddy
track meet from Davidson April 6, the
Spiders coming out on the long end of
an 89 to 37 count.

A steady rain which turned the field
at Milhiser Staditim into mud slowed
down the runners and shortened the dis-
tance in the weight events,

Jack Bristow led his teammates in
scoring by marking up ten points. He
took two firsts, one in the one hundred-
yard dash and another in the two hun-
dred and twenty-yard dash. The feature
of the meet was a twenty-foot broad
jump by Captain Jimmy West of the
Richmond squad. This was two feet fur-
ther than any other leap made during
the day. Byerly and Dickson were the
only men from the Davidson team that
placed in two events. They each scored
four points.
