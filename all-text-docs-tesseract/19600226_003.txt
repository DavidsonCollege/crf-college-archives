DAVE HOLLINGSWORTH, leading scorer on last
year’s basketball team and one of the conference’s best
rebounders, spent most of the winter playing AAU ball
with a Seattle, Wash., entry, the Buchane ers. He is
now working for a real estate concern in California.

Big Dave, who did not start for the Bakers, but saw
considerable reserve duty, played against the Russian
All-Star team that toured America last year. Playing in
the same AAU league are the Phillips 66 Oilers, Peoria
Caterpillars, and the Vickers Oilers, all of which con-
tributed players to the American team in the Pan
American Games.

Hollingsworth, in a letter to Bill Shinn, commented
that he didn’t feel bad sitting on the bench when he
looked over and saw All-Americans Lou Pucillo and Gene

Southern Loop Lead
Hangs In The Balance

Coach Shoe’s Catfish left for Charleston this after-
noon for their last and most crucial regular season meet.

Having won eight of nine meets, the Wildcats will
be pitted tomorrow against The Citadel, undefeated in
eight meets.

The finals will start at 8:00

Of the five teams in the meet,
Coach Charlie Parker said that
West Virginia, the defending
champion, and last year’s run-
ner-up, V.P.L, should have the
strongest teams. V.M.I. should
also be strong, with the Citadel
and Davidson being the weak-
est.

Hollingsworth is biding his time until he goes into
the service. After a six-months hitch in the army he
plans to go to law school at Willamette University in

Oregon and will heip pay his way by coaching the Wil-

lamette freshman basketball team.

BILL SHINN, who led this year’s scorers with a 14
plus average, was Davidson’s lone representative on the
all-conference teams that have been released so far.
We didn’t scratch on the Southern Conference Sports-
writers Association poll but Shinn was accorded an
honorable mention on the UPI team.

with a desperate stratagem, tried to enter two ineligible
swimmers. Announcer Jennings “The Body” Snider in

book and was about to announce them before he was

THE 1960 SWIMMING TEAM may well be the best
athletic team at Davidson since the days of Lacy Keesler
and Corky Clark in tennis, when Davidson won two con-
ference titles in a row. Members of this year’s tank
team have broken, over a two-year period, every pool
record except those set by the great Tommy Rivers in
the sprints in 1956. They set five new records in the
space of nine days this year. In Coach Dwight Shoe’s
vernacular,“They’re doin’ a helluva job.”

If Davidson comes out on top,
the Southern Conference lead
will be thrown into a four-way
tie: Davidson, The Citadel, VMI
and VPI. The loop tourney will
be held next Thursday thru
Saturday at Charleston.

Shoe said this week that to-
morrow's splash would hinge on
the 220 yd. and 440 yd. free-
style events.

HUDGINS KEY MAN

“The Cadets have a _ boy
named Hunter who — should
force Hudgins to give it all he’s
got,” said Shoe. Hudgins will
be swimming in both freestyles
plus the 400 yd. freestyle relay.

In other events
lineup looks like this:

400 yd. medley relay—Tom
Smith, John Scott, George
Gable and Barry Branch.

159-30, while Davidson breezed

beaten Georgia squads were
about the same.

RECORDS FALL

“All my boys are in good
shape,” said Shoe.

They were in good shape and
good style last Friday as they
romped over Emory here.

Two more pool records fell in
the Emory meet as the Catfish
set their fifth new mark in nine
days. Diver Jack Rose displayed
near flawless form in setting a
new point total at 172.9.

The 400-ydrd medley relay
team smashed the old mark by
five seconds in posting a 4:15.1
time

LOOP TOSS-UP

The conference meet next
weck will be a toss-up. But
Shoe figures VMI “is definitely
No, 1.” He rated the Wildcats
third behind The Citadel, with
VPI fourth. Davidson's only loss
was to VMI.

“We don't’-eount on any
trouble from William and
Mary,’ Shoe added.

Main worry of Coach Shoe

for both The Citadel and the
conference meets will be depth.
The Catfish don’t have it, but
the other teams do.

“The boys have _ spirit,
though, and I think we can
beat VMI this time around.”

Finish

Davidson's ROTC -rifle team

walloped N. C. State last Friday
1391-1364 on the home range.
The Wildcats’ Stan Gaines shot
for 286 points and Don Harper
garnered 280 points.

The Davidson ROTC team
fired its last volley this year
in the Western Carolina Con-
ference, today at Wofford. Dav-
idson defended its last year's
championship. The Wildcat fire
team packed a 5-1 record and
close-contending Furman boast-
ed a 4-2 mark before the match.

PRESSLY

The win gave the ’Cats a

team headed by guards Jerry
Busseli and Tom Harris.

Sophomore forwards Allan
Miller and D. G. Martin, along
with center Bob Moore, will
be counted on heavily next
year. Also returning will be
juniors Joe Markee, Bill
Shinn and Jim Nuckells.

In regard to the promising
freshmen, Coach Hunt com-
mented, “We're counting heav-
ily on Bill Jarman and Heywood
Evans next year.”

Last Saturday at Charleston
The Citadel dropped the ’Cats
by a 92-65 score. After a close
first half, Citadel leading 39-38,
the Cadets pulled out to a quick
lead and coasted to a win.

The frosh ended the season
with a 5-7 record. In the last
two games, Davidson absorbed
defeats at the hands of Pfeiffer
and Wingate.

Pfeiffer took the Wildkittens

by a 68-64 score. They led at
half 35-27. Jarman had 23 and
Evans 24 to lead the frosh scor-
ing.
Against Wingate, the loss of
Bill Jarman hurt. When the
center badly sprained his ankle
early in the game, the Wildkit-

Coach Hunt said, “With Jar-
