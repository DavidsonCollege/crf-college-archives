of many books dealing with
Christian responsibility toward
society in relation to such things
as politics, nuclear testing, and
the threat of war.

One of his better known books
is Christians and the State. His
most recent book, which con-
cerns thermonuclear testing and

the threat of nuclear war, is
Nuclear Weapons and the Con-
flict of Conscience. Dr. Bennett
is one of the editors of the
weekly magazine Christianity
and Crisis. He has also recently
had articles published in Es-
quire and Saturday Review of

the-Year Chairman Lowery Reid
announced that any professor
who is interested in having Dr.
Bennett visit his class should
contact Dr. Staples.

Reid also urged all students
and faculty to read the book and
come to the panel discussion
Monday night. He stressed the
fact that the book could be
easily read in an evening but
that the program Monday night
would be of value to everyone
whether he had read the book
or not.

BY CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The 15th annual Fine Arts Festival, beginning April 6 and continuing into May,
will emphasize new artists and new works. Its theme will be ‘“‘exploratory,” and will

be concerned with the creative process.
“Past Festivals have present- are not yet established. We hope most outstanding piece of crea-

ed already established artists,”
Dr. J. S. Purcell, Faculty Fine
Arts Committee chairman, stat-
ed today. “This year we will
feature artists who have shown
evidence of attainment but who

Student Council Sets
Magazine Controls

The Student Council voted Wednesday night to
create the Magazine Advisory Board for the student

magazine.

As proposed, the Board will
be composed of the editor of the
student magazine; two members
elected by Sigma Upsilon, one
of whom will be an underclass-
man; one member elected by
Eumanean Literary Society; one
member elected by Philanthro-
pic Literary Society; a student
appointed by the chairman of
the Fine Arts Dept.; a student
council member appointed by
the president of the Student
Body; a faculty member selected
later by the Board; and a facul-
ty member appointed by the
President of the College, who
will act as chairman of the
Board,

BOARD'S PURPOSE

The purpose of the Board
shall be to determine and con-
tinuously maintain the general
aims of the student magazine.

ing him and by discovering and
channeling to him material for
his editorial consideration.

George Trask, the Board makes
specific allowances for an ad-
ministration-appointed faculty
member whose duty will be to
maintain the same general spirit
and aims of the magazine.

EDITOR ONLY CENSOR

The representatives of stud-
ent organizations are to solicit
materials from their organiza-
tions for submission to the edi-
tor. However, only the editor
will have the power of censor-
ship.

At present, the Advisory
Board is only a ruling to allow
the Publications Board to begin
the selection of candidates for
editor. This ruling will become
a Student Council by-law at a
later date, following further
discussion.

Other discussion at the Stud-
ent Council meeting centered
around the conduct of the pres-
ent elections, especially the
means of ballot distribution.

to help students realize what the
creative process is and stimu-
late their interest and participa-
tion in it.”

The festival will offer fre-
quent opportunities for stud-
ents to talk with the young
writers, painters, and musi-
cians who will come to the
campus.

The first event will be a pro-
gram of chamber music pre-
sented in Hodson Hall Monday

bers of the Charlotte Symphony
Orchestra. ‘‘This will be another
look at a type of expression
that needs to be rediscovered,”
Purcell noted.

Joseph Silverstein, violinist,
will present a concert as part
of the Artist Series schedule
April 9. Silverstein won the Wal-
ter W. Naumburg Foundation
Award this year. The award,
worth $25,000, is presented an-
nually to a young musician of
great promise. This concert is
the only part of the festival for
which an admissions charge will
be made.

Two films will be shown
“to explore the potential ar-
tistry in film making,” Pur-
cell stated. “Hiroshima, Mon
Amour,” contributed by the
Union Film Committee, will
be shown April 11 and 12. On
a date still undetermined,
Dave Simpson will present his
own experimental film.

Dr. Grier Williams, trumpet;
Prof. David Richey, piano; and
Mrs. Elaine Richey, violin, will

lin written by her husband.
Prof. Richey will play two of

IFC Announces Concert,
Frolics Plans, Revisions

Bob Waugh, IFC mentor, has announced the council’s action in adopting propos-
ed constitution revisions and the line-up of . attractions for Spring Frolics and the

April concert weekend.

The Four Preps, Capitol re-
cording artists, will highlight

ture.
Sas

the April 14 IFC concert from

| 8-10 p.m. in Chambers Auditor-

ium. The group consisting of a
high tenor, lead tenor, a bari-
tone, and a bass have had many
hit recordings including “26
Miles,” “Big Man,” and “Down
By The Station.” All were writ-
ten by members of the group.

They appeared in the movie

“Gidget” and have performed

on the Lawrence Welk, Dick

Clark, Ed Sullivan and Ten-

nessee Ernie Ford television
shows.

Waugh announced that the
IFC voted 10-2 Monday night in
favor of revising its constitu-
tion. The revisions gave the fra-
ternity presidents a non-voting
seat on the council with voting

| rights in the absence of his fra-

ternity’s representative.

With this action, the IFC be-
comes the sole interfraternity
body and is responsible for
liaison between the fraternities
and the administration. All
judicial action wili be reported
to the administration's Frater-
nity Liaison Officer.

Waugh also announced that
IFC elections will take place
April 9, and that the council
plans to issue a newsletter
containing features from all
fraternities April 14.

The initial idea, presented by
Sigma Nu President Bob Phil-
lips, includes the formation of
six committees: Social, Scholar-

been contracted to perform at
the Spring Frolics semi-formal
dance Friday night, April 27.
The popular South Carolina
dance band will also back up
several performances by record:
ing star Dakota Staton.

The Saturday afternoon con-
cert features Lester Fiatt,
Earl Scruggs and the Foggy
Mountain Boys. Scruggs is
considered a master of the
five-string banjo and Flatt is
the lead singer and guitar
picker. They are backed by
the fiddle, mandolin, bass and
guitar.

Waugh said that the council

has sent a letter of protest to
Willard Alexander, Inc., talent
agent for Josh White against
the general handling of the
March 11 concert by White.
White was forced to delay a
scheduled Saturday night per-
formance until the following day
because of inadequate transpor-
tation facilities.

A copy of tne letter has been
sent to a New York agency
which represents college unions
and handles problems of unful-
filled contract obligations. The
council thought that more con-
sideration was due after paying
$1600 for the concert.
