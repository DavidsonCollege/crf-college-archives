SCHEDULE APPROVED

Six Teams of Dixie Debating
League to be Met in
Competition

Davidson debating teams were assigned
to their respective debates by the Faculty
Committee last Thursday, January 10.
The schedule will include eight
schools, six of which are members of the
Dixie Debating League and will oppose
Davidson in their try for the silver lov-
ing cup for the best team in the league.

At the meeting of the faculty commit-
tee last Thursday afternoon with Dr.
Currie presiding, the teams were made
and approved. The schedule
itself is very hard and a number of the
teams will have to work up both sides of a
question and in some instances change the
whole topic.

The teams as arranged by the commit-
tee are as follows:

Fresh Quint Loses
Tilt With Wingate

Wildkittens Lose First Game of
Season to Junior College

The Davidson “Wildkittens” lost a well-
played game to the Wingate quintet Mon-
day afternoon, The wearers of the Red
and Black started off with a rush. In
a few minutes the score was ten to two in
favor of the home team. As tHe game
advanced Wingate gradually gained on the
Wildkittens.. The score at the end of
the half was 14 to 2. At the beginning
of the second half Wingate shot several
goals in quick succession. Hutaff acting
captain for the team called time out and
when play was resumed the defense of
th Kittens was much stronger. They
were gradually gaining on the visitors.
Soon the score was tied and from then on
first one team and then the other was
leading. It was a real nip and tuck af-
fair and many fouls were made. Mont-
gomery of the locals was the only man
who made four pergonal fouls. As the
game was nearing its end both teams
seemed tired out. Just as the gun sounded
Davidson was fighting hard to tie the
score, which stood then 31-33. |

Triplett and Yaddy were the outstand-
ing players for the visitors; Triplett was
high scorer of the game, making eighteen
points. Yaddy succeeded in ringing up
eleven points.

Dr. Henderson was making the principal

of Phi Beta Kappa, national honorary
scholastic fraternity at Davidson College.
He spoke to a packed audience which had
gathered for the public exercises, using
the subject, “The Higher Scholarship.”
The speaker began his remarks by de-
claring that the civilization of the world
is living in the midst of a great awaken-
ing, which, “under the wizard hands of
