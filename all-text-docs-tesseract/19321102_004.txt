TREKKING WEST

ENTIRE UNITED STATES FLEET
IN RARBOR

———- By JACK WILLIAMS, Jr. ——_——

NOTE: Below is one of a series of
request articles written in connection
with a visit by the writer with his father
to the National Editorial Associaton con-
vention in California this summer.

Doing things in a big way as host to the
National Editorial Association at Long
Beach, Califarnia, William C. Hosking bor-
rowed a 34,000-ton ocean liner, one of the
largest on the Pacific with a crew of 350,
to give his guests a breakfast.

The ship was the California, of the Pan-
ama Pacific Line, in Los.Angeles port.from
New York. This is: the largest and finest
ship ever ‘built under the American flag and
I can vouch for the excellence of its table.

We ordered at will from the ambrosial
fare and I think those 500 hungry editors
relieved the ship of a great portion of its
cargo before it left port. They served us
with Honeydew Melon, Ronian Meal, Broiled
English Bloater, Potatoes Lyonnaise, Shirred

Eggs, Melba Toast, Wine Jelly, and Green
Tea. Afterwards we inspected-the-ship-and
saw the unique built-in pools, spacious

lounges, gymn, concert halls, suites, where
you can really “spread” yourself, and many
other attractions. It was.with regrets the
editors said farewell to Captain Robert
Smith. e :

VISIT BATTLESHIP

Launches of the United States Navy met
the party at the pier and we started out
into the harbor where the entire’ United
States Fleet was riding majestically at an-
chor. On our way out the California backed
—eout-of-her—berth—and-continued her. voyage
to San Francisco, The liner was supposed
to sail at 9:00 o’clock and was held up two
hours™so"tfie N. E. A.’s might have the ex-
perience of eating a real sea-going break-
fast on board. Our little craft seemed small
by the side of the huge liner and it passed,
whistles blowing, to leave us riding on the
crest of its waves.

This ship belongs to a fleet of electric
liners operating between New York and
California ports by a subsidiary of the Roose-
velt Steamship Company, of which Kermit
Roosevelt, son of Theodore Roosevelt, is
president.

On our way we passed another unusual
sight in the harbor. The Japanese sailing
ship Taisei Maru, with its towering spars,
had just arrived from the Tokio Nautical
College. She came direct from -YokeHama
for the Olympiad. This ship is regarded to
be one of the world’s finest school ships.
As we passed we all waved and those on
board rafi”to the side and waved back in
response.

We boarded the battleship Pennsylvania,
flagship of the United States Fleet, and
closely inspected the maze of decks and in-
tricate workings of the great fighting ma-
chine. Scarcely had we arrived on board
when they collected our kodaks so that no
‘pictures-of the ship could be carried away.

Sailors were everywhere and the girls in the A

editorial party were thrilled to be surround-
ed by 1,400 at one time.

INSPECT FIGHTING SHIP

Officers carried the party over the ship
in groups. We saw 14-inch guns which hurl
eight and one-half tons of steel and explo-
sives per minute at a target fifteen miles
away—and hit it. In the port gangway all
the machinery is found necessary to oper-
ate the guns. From its top a plane can be
launched, attaining 60 miles an hour in 55
feet.

The ship had its own barber shop and
postoftice. We next visited He crews’ quar-
ters.

the left facing aft was the recreation space
and this serves as a gym for the sailors.

By climbing the ladder on the second tur-
ret we reached the boat deck and found two

more guns. Rising still higher by three
short ladders we cafhe to the signal bridge.

looked good to me and I’m used to eating at
Kimbrell’s. That day they had soup, three
vegetables, and dessert. It would make the
most industrious Davidson housewife jeal-
ous to see how scrupulousty clean the kitch-
ens are kept.

This was one of the first things we no-
ticed. The floors had been scrubbed until
they looked clean enough to eat on. The
compactness of a battleship is another out-
standing feature. The sailors publish their
own paper aboard and have “talkie” pictures
every night. One of the startling things I
discovered is that the Pennsylvania is cov-
ered with paint weighing between five and
six hundred tons! Ben Taylor and those in
his party also visited this battleship while
visiting relatives this summer in Long Beach.
According to ar account of their tour, they
enjoyed their visit, too.

Following the inspection, we were taken
to Long Beach where we were guests of the
various tnits of the UnitedStates Fleet. On
a tour of Long Beach we observed the ter-
minals and waterways that make up the bil-
lion-dollar business for the Los Angeles
port. The tour included_a ride around the
$2,500,000 Rainbow Pier and a visit to the
Municipal Auditorium. We stopped at the
Signal Hill oil field on our way back to
Los Angeles. This is one of the most phe-
nomenal petroleum producing centers known.
Here are found 1,200 wells and the deepest
oil well in the world. x

The events of the morning impressed the
party with the hospitality of California. Its
people are always ready to entertain and
take especial interest in tourists.’ Perhaps
this accounts to a large extent for the great
hopularity of this state.

Nearly every person met in Long Beach
came from Iowa. At the annual Iowa pic-
nic held in the public park, about fifteen
thousand Iowans assemble. I heard-a-can-
didate. running for mayor promised in his
announcement that if elected he would move
back to lowa when his term expired. They
say he was elected.

Wednesday, Nov. 2—Divorce in the Family—
(M-G-M)

Jackie Cooper plays the leading role in
this picture which treats one'of the most
heart-rending problems of today, namely,
“What becomes of children when the parents
are divorced and marry again?” It’s a hard
road, beset with tears, but also laughs. Coop-
er does some of his best acting and with
wonderful naturalness. Lois Wilson, Conrad
Nagel and Lewis Stone play the grown-ups.

Friday, Nov. 4+~Three On A Match

One of the modern trends in pictures
seems to be the showmg of the connection
of widely separated lives (perhaps originated |
in Grand Hotel).

This time the connection is between three
school friends who meet after ten years.
The story follows chiefly Ann Dvorak who
is restless and dissatisfied with life. The
ending is too sad and too cruel for the pop-
ular taste.

of cannibals who think that he is going to! i

By her vivid personality Ann Dvorak
sweeps away the weaknesses of a melo-
dramatic story and makes the troubles of a
girl who laughed at the superstition of
“three on a match” seem very real.

Saturday, Nov. 5—The Vanishing Frontier—
(Paramount)

Johnny Mack Brown plays his part very
well in. this thrilling drama of early Cali-
fornia. Accused unjustly of murder, he bat-
tles soldiers, escapes, and wins the girl (Eva-
lyn Knapp). Plenty of action and also plenty
of good scenery. Johnny has deserted his
Alabama accent and acquired a quaint Span-

ish one.
