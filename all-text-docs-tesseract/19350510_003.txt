Former College Head Talks |
Over Old Times At Davidson

Thinks Dances On Campus
Under Supervision
Superior To Present
System

by Harry Kuykendall

Dr. Henry Louise Smith, former
President of Davidson College and one
of the outstanding men in the United
States today, served as the target for
this week’s interview.

So interesting and abundant was the
information that Dr. Smith laid before
the reporter, that the latter alnidst de-
cided to write a biography instead of a
news article, and could have easily done
so.
Although there are very few students
who do not know who Dr. Smith is, an
introduction, we feel sure, will greatly
enhance the interest of the reader.

Dr. Smith, President Emeritus of

Washington and Lee University, a
scientist, scholar, teacher, lecturer, and
author, served as president of Davidson
from 1901-1912, during which tinTeshe
doubled the endowment, trebled the
attendance, and trebled the buildings
and equipment of the collége.
“ Coming back to’ the~interview, the
reporter was shown the way to Dr.
Smith’s study, where he received a
very cordial and sincere greeting, and
also an invitation to make himself at
home which he promptly did.

Having heard the reporters “why and
wherefore”, and his explanation of the
nature of his visit Dr. Smith pushed
aside an orderly pile of important look-
ing papers explaining that they were
pages from his new volume of five
books (which he intends to publish
sometime in the future).

Having thus prepared himself, Dr.
Smith bravely waited for the verbal
iquisition that took place somewhat as
follows:

“Dr-,in beginning, I'd like to ask you
quite a few questions about your per-
sonal life.

“First, I believe it would*be inter-
esting to know just where you received
your college education?”

“T received an A. B. degree at David-
son in 1881, an M.A. also at Davidson
in 1886 as outside work. My Ph. D.
degree I received at the University
of Virginia in 1891, and later an LL.D
degree given me by the University of
North Carolina. I also spent some
little time in the laboratories of Har-
vard and Cornell Universities”.

PRIVATE WORLDS

The theme deals with the idea that
each and everyone of us lives in a little
private world of his own, crowded with
inhibitions, frustrations, secrets loves,
ete. The story itself is unreeled in a
hospital which houses mental defect-
ives, The tale abounds in love, intrigue
and suspense, and rips the veil from us
poor mortals, showing how petty we
can be. Claudette Colbert performs

Professors Find Niches As
Campus Gagmen; Anxious
World Awaits Results

Beaten to the wall, utterly exhausted
by a years struggle for humor, the re-
tiring Yow! staff, headed by the chief
Yowler, Lorenzo McPhail, gives up and
turns to the faculty for inspiration and
succor,

And the feature of the next example
of humor will be the favorite
of professors on the faculty. MePhail,
McLeod. McOverton and MecWyche
all in unsion say that the faculty has
the Student Body entirely outclassed in
the field of humor, hynmor—as the elite
pronunciate it.

The perpetration of the foul deed
took place Tuesday, altho the murder
las been planned for weeks. And the re-
sults will appear May 15, we hope.
Honorably Gordon “Skip Brown has
labelled it with the final “Yow!” cover
of his career. The campus heaves a
sight of relief.

McPhail says it is not any good and
McPhail is modest.- Wyche sayes its
worse than McPhail sayes it is. In it
there will be a Senior questionnaire,
timely placed so the answers won't
have to be printed. Overton and
Calloway dropped ink all over it, we
are informed by the Editor. They were
aided in this by Richard Vowles and
Sam Ryburn.

There will be the usual wisecraks
about commencement, the breadline
and looking at world thru a rolled up
diploma, so we are informed. The
summer sports section will be handled
by Bob Johnson and the musical sqirts
will be done up by Howard Dyer.

It will hold twenty pages, not includ-
ing cover, and in it will be engraved
the name of the guy who thinks his
ioke is original. @»
