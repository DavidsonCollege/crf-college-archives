It was maintained by the pastor

These stages are to execute an

Advice Asked
By Y Cabinet

Looking For Hints As To Use
Of Gift Fund

About this time of year the Y.M.
C.A, Cabinet begins to think about
the Annual Christmas Gift Fund.
The most important plan which must
be made at this time to decide
what this gift fund is to be used for.

Last year the Christmas Gift Fund
was used to send Bibles to China,
concentration

is

camps in Germany,
and to each man on a UV, S. battle-
ship.

Will Decide

This weekend at their retreat, the
"Y" Cabinet will decide on the ob-
jective of this year’s gift.

Alf Taylor, who is chairman of
the committee on World Evangelism
and therefore in charge of the Gift*
Fund, is asking Davidson students
to think seriously about what they
would like for the objective to be
this year.

Any suggestions along this line
will be greatly appreciated and
should be given to Alf Taylor or
Shaw Smith.
