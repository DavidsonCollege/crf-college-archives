QUALITY

A. H. Currie, the president of the
student body, wrote an inspiring letter in
the first copy of the Davidsonian urging
all freshmen to get into the spirit of
things. We notice that the football team
played some of the leading universities
of the south, and the student body was
right behind the team just as it is this

In that year our present laundry plant
was installed. This was a great help to
the boys, for they had been limited as to
the amount of clothing that they could

have laundered theretofore. At that

The

work of Fewell and Owens was also out-|

| McConnell was the bright light on defense
| for Davidson, this plucky little end always
keeping the plays in, and making a majority
of the tackles. LeFerve was also a strength
in the line-on defense, few' plays being run
over him, On offense Kell and Flinn were
the outstanding ground gainers, while Wen-
burg ran back punts for 15 to 20 yards prac-
tically every time. He was especially adept
at dodging the ends and circling the tackles.
Kell made the longest gain of the afternoon,
getting loose on an end run for 44 yards,
