Terms Just a word concerning this depart-

ment. It is the desire of the Davidson-
ian to fill this column with nothing but
“Campus Personals.” We want to keep
exchange jokes entirely out if possible,
but the lack of material makes it nec-
cessary to fill in sometimes. In this con-
nection we hope that the students will
S| co-operate with us, and turn in all suit-
able “Peanut Parcher dope” to the
Campus Editor. Thanks.

the contest. This diminutive second-
sacker kept up the fast pace he set dur-
ing the North Carolina trip. A free
ticket and a long double to the left
field fence was his contribution out of
four trips to the plate. In the field his
glove absorbed seven grounders and one
fiy. In the last five games he has clout-
ed the pill for an average of 412 and
fielded 970 Atta boy! Pee-Wee.

After two were gone in the second,
Ratchford looked over four wide ones
and swiped second when Morrison wasn’t
looking. Freeman came through with a
timely bingle to center and Ratchford
counted. Jeannette had some trouble
with his back and Freeman’s hit went
between his legs. Freeman headed for
home but Hunter flagged him down at! g
the hot corner. Erwin ended the stanza
by whiffing.

Davidson's fast tally came after two
big ones were gone in the ninth. Bar-
nette, pinch hitting for Freeman, lashed
a savage double to left. Curris did what
pitchers aren’t supposed to do and hit
to right, and Barnette read the welcome
sign on home plate. Billy Hodgin ended
it by bouncing to Johnson.

The Baptist’s four tallies came in one
big cluster in the third. Cassell lost
Morrison's grounder, Johnston walked
and Stringfield came up. Cassell’s rival
for All-State honors “put his weight”
against one of Buck’s benders and dent-
ed a slat in the center field fence for
three bases. Jeannette grounded out to
Erwin and Stringfield stuck to third.
Ellis brought him in with a hit to left
and pilfered the keystone sack. Dun-
can beat out his second infield hit. On
an attempt at a double steal, Wrenn’s
throw to Cassell got the fast Duncan
yards off second. But Jake aimed his
return at the moon (and nearly hit it)
and Ellis’ spikes dented the rubber.
