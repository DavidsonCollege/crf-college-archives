Self Study: Davidson needs racial acceptance

By JONATHAN SIPLING
Staff Writer

The 1995-96 Self-Study Re-
port of the Focus Group on the
Student Experience finds that, “to
the detriment of all, Davidson has
not yet reached an appropriate level
of appreciation for the contribu-
tions of the African-American
members of our community.”

While asserting that “there
seems to be a consensus that overt
acts of racism on the Davidson

College campus are now rare,” the
focus group maintains that “the
College still manifests subtle as-

pects of racism that should not be

tolerated.”

Many of these aspects are not
intended as offensive or discrimi-
natory, butare attributable to igno-
rance in considering how an act
may be perceived by another, the
Study says. Included among this
type of subtle racism are the hang-
ing of the Confederate flag, de-
rogatory remarks about music and
clothing, and college personnel
asking African-American students

if they are students or workers.

Tom Shandley, Dean of Stu-
dents and member of the Focus
Committee on the Student Expe-
rience, says that “one of the most
painful things we heard from Af-
rican American students was a
feeling of isolation, a feeling that
you could walk down the halls
and have no one say hello to you...
It’s that sort of subtle tension that
tends to break down one’s self-
esteem.”

For the most part, the Self-
Study finds, minority students feel
the faculty are “sensitive to their
concerns,” excepting a few “‘per-

SGA proposes to ins
cards on doors of Chambers

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL

Student safety at Davidson
doesn’t seem a pressing issue to
many students. Afterall, Davidson
College was recently recognized
by Security Works magazine as
one of the most secure collegecam-
puses in the nation.

- However, cat cards may soon
be necessary to enter the 24 hour
study room, Martin Chemistry
Building, and Chambers between
the late evening and early morning
hours.

The SGA Senate body recom-
mended such security measures

Tuesday evening by passing acam-
pus security resolution introduced
by Sophomore Class President
Lucian Dervan and Rusk Senator
Heather Brown, also a sophomore.

Dervan and Brown serve as
SGA Co-Chairs of the Student
Advisory Council to the Director
of Campus Safety. Sophomore
Anne Ford acts as Student Body
Chair of the SAC.

Terms of the resolution rec-
ognize that the 24 hour study room,
Chambers, and the Martin Chem-
istry Building are all used by stu-
dents late at night and do not fea-
ture cat card access. The resolu-
tion goes on to state that because
“the police have great difficulty
preventing unauthorized entry into
these buildings by non-Davidson

affiliated persons;...these areas are
potentially dangerous to Davidson
students due to lack of security”.
In passing the resolution, the
SGA encouraged the administra-
tion to “implement cat card access
on the 24 hour Study Room, the
East side automatic, North and
South entrances of Chambers and
the Martin Chemistry Building.”
Dervan explains that the ad-
ministration has long considered
such action and says that the reso-
lution was brought before the SGA
“to make clear that students were
in favor of [these measures].”
Although the campus police
department has voiced concern as
to their ability to adequately patrol
Chambers late at night, not all stu-
dents are worried about safety in
the area.
“T think it’s a safe environ-

“ment,” says freshman Seth Car-

penter who often studies inCham-
bers, “I don’t feel threatened at

all,”

Sophomore Ashley Weedn
says that although she does not feel
that her safety is threatened while
she studies in Chambers, she be-
lieves’ that increased security“is
probably a good idea.

Carrie Sloan, a sophomore,
agrees that the resolution’s call for
heightened security “is a good idea.
It’s really scary,” she notes, “when
you are here late at night.”

If approved by the adminis-
tration, the project will likely be
completed this summer, says
Dervan. The estimated expenses,
which total approximately
$80,000, would probably be split
over two years’ budgets.

Some students have voiced
their displeasure with the prospect
of one sacrifice required by the cat
card installation. Because Cham-
bers’ swinging doors are too heavy
to facilitate a cat card system, they
will have to be replaced.

Buechner makes three day
pilgrimage at Davidson

By CATHERINE ANDERSON

The 1996 Staley Distinguished
Christian Scholar Lecture Series
brought noted theologian and one
of today’s most powerful writers
on religious themes to Davidson
this past week. Fredrick Buechner,
a graduate of Princeton University
and Union Theological Seminary
and author of 12 novels, 12 works
of non-fiction and numerous es-
says and sermons, began the series
last Sunday presenting the 11 a.m.
sermon at Davidson College Pres-
byterian Church.

He spoke later that evening on
“The Faces of Jesus,” when he

retold the story of Jesus through a
slide show portraying the depic-
tion of the face of Jesus from dif-
ferent artistic traditions, from Af-
rican to Northern Renaissance to
Contemporary genres.

Monday evening he drew a
packed sanctuary for his poignant
lecture on “The Longing for
Home,” describing what home
meant to him, the universal search
for a spiritual home and the con-
tinuous search that remains foreach
individual.

Buechner concluded his se-
ries Tuesday with readings from
his works of fiction Book of Beb
and Godric in the 900 Room of the
College Union.

“T felt like [the series] went
very well,” says Robert Spach,
College Chaplain. “He came
across as a very genuine person
and spoke very honestly.” Spach
felt the lectures were well received
and had a definite impact on the
college community. He felt that
Buechner’s time spent with stu-
dents made an otherwise distanced
figure much more human and real.

“He talked about his own life
and related it to his faith in a very
meaningful way,” Spach said.

ceived incidents of stereotyping
minority students and possibly un-
fair grading.” ;

_ The Self-Study acknowledges,
however, that a solution to these
problems associated with subtle
racism would be difficult to deter-
mine, as “a presentation or forum
will most likely attract the students
who least need this education.”

“It seems like every year there
are fewer opportunities to move
towards that awareness,” says Jun-
ior Zikusooka Joseph. He feels that
there are not enough events de-
voted to bringing alternative cul-
tures to the campus. “The campus
community has not been invited to
deal with the issue has a group,”
says Joseph.

Says Junior Saad Gul, ‘Per-
sonal relations between the races
— one on one —at Davidson could
not be better. On a group basis

though, one could probably hope
for greater understanding of
eachother.”

The ideal situation concern-
ing racial tolerance, according to
the Self-Study, will occur when
Davidson comes to the full realiza-
tion that, like international students,
“African-American students also
bring different experiences and
backgrounds that ... contribute to
the educational mission of the Col-
lege.”

Dean Shandley says there is a
belief that improved attention to
appreciation of diversity at orien-
tation and during PE 101 could
help the situation.

He also felt, however that the
best way to build a campus that is
not only tolerant of but grateful for
diversity could be to continue to
try to increase the number of Afri-
can American students here.

Junior Mary Dowd
gives bone marrow

Junior Mary
Dowd gave a
precious giftto
a perfect
strangerearlier
this month
when she do-
nated bone marrow at North Caro-

lina’ Baptist Hospital in Winston-
Suit at iced saath titi

entered in the national registry,
Dowd was designated as the closest
match for the needy patient.

Dowd became an eligible do-
nor by registering for the national
bone marrow registry at Project
Life’s annual drive, and she was
contacted earlier this year as a pos-
sible match. After further exami-
nation, Dowd reached the fourth
and final level of the matching pro-
cess and was identified as a perfect
match.

Dowd recognizes that the do-
nation of bone marrow is more than
just a clinical procedure. She con-
siders herself lucky to be able to
endure the minor inconveniences
of a donation, which could poten-
tially save the life of another.

The surgery took approxi-
mately 45 minutes. Dowd was put
under general anesthesia and was

able to go home to Charlotte next

_day. She reports that the bone

marrow extraction was uneventful
and the only side effects she expe-
rienced was stiffness and dull pain.
Although Dowd was told that
her bone marrow arrived safely for
donation, she will have to wait to
learn more information about the
recipient, whose identity and wel-
fare are withheld for a year to al-

tientis monitored through the Char-

However, Dowd did learn that
her recipient is a young child and
she arranged for a stuffed rabbit
and a card to be sent with her bone
marrow donation. She says she is
anxiously waiting to hear from the
child’s parents.

Dowd says she will donate
again if given the opportunity. She
says, “It’s overwhelming how
many (people) need transplants and
what a difference you can make.
It’s so easy to allow someone else
to live.” In light of the récent
leukemia diagnosis of Jack
McCarthy, the son of Susan Rob-
erts and Kevin McCarthy, Dowd
highly recommends registering as
a possible bone marrow donor.

Jack’s Rabbits is the name for the support group for little
Jack McCarthy. This emblem was drawn by his brother
Cormac, who will soon donate his bone marrow to Jack.
Those who want to bring gifts should think “busy” and
“small.” and leave them on the front porch of 560 Pine Road.
