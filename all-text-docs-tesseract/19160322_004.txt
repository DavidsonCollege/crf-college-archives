ARTICLES WORTH READING.| DR. THORNTON LECTURES

Do you know what you want to read
when you pick up the magazines in the
reading room? THe Davipsonian has
undertaken to publish a short list of
worth-while articles which come out in
the current magazines. The first list
appeared in last week's issue, under the
heading “Articles Worth Reading in
Current Magazines,” and other _ lists
will appear from time to time.

This has been undertaken with the
idea of providing a kind of directory to
help students to find the things that are
interesting and really worth the time it
takes to read them. It is not a complete
directory of all that is good in the maga-
zines, but it is made up with care, and
an attempt is made to include in it not
only articles on economic, social and po-
litical questions, etc., but some of the
best stories and poems.

It is hoped that this list will prove
useful; and if it directs you to a good
article or saves you time in finding the
thing you want to read, its purpose will
-not have failed.

THE SELECTION OF JUNIOR
AND SENIOR ORATORS

The present method of selecting the
Junior and Senior competitors for the
medals in the oratorical contests is of
rather recent origin. During the early
days of the college the literary societies
voted on these men and the “reps” were
given according to the vote. After a
number of years it was thought to be a
more satisfactory plan to leave the selec-
tion to a committee of the faculty.

The question was raised in February,
1890, and discust in the societies for some
time. Quite a number of called meet-
ings were held for the purpose of dis-
cussing it. On April 4, 1890, it was
moved and passed by the Eumenean So-
ciety that this be done. The Philanth-
ropic Society had already passed a simi-
lar resolution. during February of the
same year. mo

SPRING DEBATES.

The annual Junior-Senior Debate
will be held April 30. The query is:
“Resolved, That an amendment should
be made to the Federal Constitution for-
bidding the sale of intoxicating liquors
in the United States.”

The Fresh-Soph Debate is scheduled
for May 1. The query for this debate
is: “Resolved, That within the next
four years the United States should
grant. the Philippines their independ-
ence.’

The Civic League has been promised
a visit in the near future from the sta-
tion grounds oxpert of the Southern
Railway to make suggestions for im-
provements here. The League has also
assumed pavment of the rent for the un-
sightly bill board near the station and it
will scon be removed.

ceipts from this would amount to $100,-
000,000 a year if it were worked to its
utmost.

Dr. Thornton’s closing words were:
“God has sent it to us, and we have done
it, not for glory, not for pride, but for
Him and our fellow-men.”

BASE BALL SEASON

(Continued from page 1)

better control, and seems to be overcom-
ing his tendency to wildness, which was
his chief fault. It is probable that Coach
Fetzer will let these hurlers alternate in
the first few games, until they become
accustomed to the grinding of the full
nine innings, and use two or three men a
game. Oak Ridge follows Catawba to
Sprunt Field, on March 30. They have
already set themselves a recofd, in de-
feating Carolina in the first game, and
Davidson will have to reserve some
mighty good pitching for this game, so it
is likely that some of the younger pitch-
ers will work in the Catawba game.

OUR CONTEMPORARIES.

A Word—The exchange list of Tr |

DavivsoniAn has more than doubled
since the first of the year. Forty college
papers, including all of the leading pa-
pers of the South and a few representa-
tive publications from other parts of the
United States, and two religious week-
lies, “The Christian Observer” and
“Onward,” now come to its desk regu-
larly.
. * *

To Play Mercer—Wake  Forest’s
Thanksgiving game next fall will be
played in Greensboro, with Mercer Uni-
versity, of Macon, Ga.

* *

From Agnes Scott—A new paper on
our exchange list is “The Agonistic,” of
Agnes Scott College, Decatur, Ga. The
first issue of this paper appeared immedi-
ately after Christmas, and the first to
come to our desk, the issue of March 17,
is an excellent and well edited paper.
THe Davinsonian bespeaks great suc-
cess for “The Agonistic.”

A Long Debating Trip—The Varsity
debating team of Columbia University.
New York, will make an 8,000 mile
trans-continental trip, debating while

ernor Hiram Johnson, of California,
will preside at this debate.
