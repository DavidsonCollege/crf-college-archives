Phi Delts Pummel nel Pompkine at "Pre cident Wins
Pulmonary Philanthropy Party

Last Saturday at the “F” Apart-
ments, the Phi Delta Fraternity in-
troduced a new fundraising event
to their philanthropic repertoire.
Based off of Connor’s breast cancer

fundraiser where hundreds of bras 7

are hung throughout the Union, the
Phi Delts decided to decorate the
grass around “F’ hoping that their
randomly strewn “pulmonary
pumpkins” would raise awareness
for lung cancer.

“Basically, the pumpkin repre-
sents a lung. The broken pumpkin
represents what cancer does to your
lungs. Us hurling the pumpkins
hella hard and real far represents
lung cancer attacking the human
body,” remarked sophomore Phi
Delta brother Sam Haskins.

When asked what physical plant
cleaning up the pumpkins repre-
sented, Phi Delta Theta declined to
comment.

As Michael Clemente °12 left

friendly philanthropic reminder
aimed at the right side of his head.

was a very serious issue in today’s
society,” commented Clemente.

Their next event, “Theta’s Trash
T.V.’s for Typhoid” will take place
between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2
a.m. next Saturday.

Union Café’s Red Baskets
Cause Increase in Picknicking

to plastic analysts, many of whom
feel that the rise of crude plastic
prices has caused dwindling plas-
tic consumption in recent months.
On the other hand, community ac-
tion groups across campus have
expressed their jubilation with the
decision. Theo Pennant ’10, Presi-
dent of FU.T.LL.E. said Tuesday
“the café’s clear encouragement of
picnicking is a huge relief to those

Skeptics argue that
the baskets are just another phase
in the café’s collaborative scheme
with the laundry service. “It’s ob-
vious that Lula Bell and the Café

plastic baskets to cause more stains
on our pants; More stains means
more laundry business,” said a
sophomore who wished to remain
anonymous. Whatever the motives,
one fact remains clear: flimsy forks

Supporters Nationwide Rejoice

WASHINGTON - After one of
the most heated elections in Ameri-
can history, a distinguished Sena-
tor won the Presidency today. In
a victory speech given to his sup-
porters at Boston’s Faneuil Hall, he
told supporters that he would bring
change to Main Street with a strong

_ opinion on the war in Iraq and a tax

plan désigned around those making
over $250,000 a year.
Change has certainly been a

ing bailout plan recently passed
by Congress would make or break |
his election. HVAC professionals,
who have also seen their industry
collapse, voted en masse for the
Senator after he spent the past few
days highlighting his strong opin-
ion on the plumbing bailout. In an
interview with CNN’s Campbell
Brown, plumbing lobbyist Joe
Wurzelbacher described the elec-
tion results as “significant.”

hallmark of the election season,
and the Senator’s opponent vowed
to continue fighting any changes
the new President will bring to
Washington. “Change is what this
country needs,” he argued in his
concession speech, “but his change
is the wrong change. We need
real change, change that’s able to
change over time as the country
changes.”

The closing weeks of the elec-
tion saw increased interest in each
candidate’s economic — stimulus
package for the beleaguered plumb-
ing industry. Pundits have argued
for weeks that the Senator’s stance

The focus now turns to the new
President’s potential cabinet offi-
cials. Throughout the election, he
has discussed the need for recon-
ciliation between the parties, but
most media outlets predict partisan
appointments.

Thus far, the new President has
been understandably vague about
potential appointees.

In a speech last Wednesday, he
said he would “look to those tradi-
tional beating hearts of American
politics — Alaska and Delaware — to
begin the process of building [his]
cabinet.”

Opinion: Pot Luck Dinners Have and Will Always Be Socialist

During _ this
election cycle, I
have heard many
people describe
certain tax poli-
cies as social-

ist. They cry,
“ * . t
Owen Zinaman Amurica ‘8 ne
socialist! We’re
has not attended _.
luck 1 winner take all
a potluck mea’ baby!” ll tell
since Christmas, hat’.
1983 you what's so-
. cialist though:

pot luck dinners.
Icannot think of a more social-

ist dining ritual than this redistribu--

tive nature of food sharing. In this
socialist dining ritual, individuals
labor over a dish, then bring that
dish to a gathering, and finally have
to watch others take what is right-
fully theirs. This is “spreading the
wealth” at its worst. What’s mine
is mine and I don’t like sharing. I

spend $50 and toil for 4 hours mak-
ing my specialty, marinated grain-
fed filet just so and those who are
lower on the totem pole deserve to
enjoy the fruits of my labor. Which
leads me to my next point: the lack
of a proper social hierarchy within
the potluck group.

Those who are predetermined to
bring salad get to enjoy a far supe-
rior main course AND a much tasti-
er dessert. It’s simply un-American
for those who buy ready-tossed
salad to get the same benefits as
those who work long and hard for
a main course. I mean, would we
impose high taxes on the top earn-
ers simply to provide greater tax
breaks for the low-income work-
ers, thereby spreading around the
nation’s wealth? Someone needs to
put an end to this culinary wealth
spreading.
