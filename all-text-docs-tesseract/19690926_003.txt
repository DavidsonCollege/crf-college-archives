Larry Brown: Why?
A head coaching job at a college with a prestigious
basketball program has long been a burning ambition
for Larry Brown, a desire that has possessed him ever
since he was a collegiate star at North Carolina.

It seemed that he was on his way to realizing his
goal when he became afi assistant under Dean Smith
at UNC upon graduation. Very few had doubts that he
was on his way up. agli

Then, after taking time out for two vears to lead the
Oakland Oaks of the American Basketball Association
to the league title, becoming an all-star guard in the
process, he finally hit the jackpot, landing a colleg-
late coaching position that scores of other basketball
mentors would have given their eye-teeth for

It was in early May that Brown was chosen by the
Davidson powers-that-be after weeks of delay to suc
ceed the very successful Lefty Driesell as Wildcat
head coach. :

It was a dream come true for Brown. Not only did
he have the controls over one of the most success-
ful basketball programs in the country at a school
that somehow draws the best of the high school bas-
ketball talent, but he also had.the three leading scor-
ers returning from) one of the best. teams in ihe
nation.

And yet today Brown is once again looking for that
ideal coaching position he desires. ;

Why? The question has arisen again and again.
Just what did happen? Why did Brown quit?

What did happen is this: Brown quickly became
disillusionedéWith Davidson basketball when he dis-
covéred that the Wildcat program and the North Car-
olina program.weren’t the same.

It is to the credit of Davidson and Lefty that the .

Wildcats, operating on a limited budget (in com-
parison with that of UNC, UCLA, and other powers),
have finished with such enviable won-lost records
in the past few years, once being chosen by Sports
Illustrated as the best team in the nation before the
season started and lastyear finishing two points away
from a trip to the NCAA play-offs.

Brown, however, was under. the impression that
Davidson had obtained its success by going big time
in basketball in the same sense that North Carolina
had gone~big time. The shocking realization of ‘the
truth quickly drained Brown’s enthusiasm. The truth
is that UNC’s recruiting budget is four times greater
than Davidson’s.

Recruiting, however, was not the only area that
served to damper his enthusiasm. According to cer-
tain sports writers who have been close to the David-
son basketball scene, Davidson’s high standards of
admission, the limited over-all basketball budget, and
several minor incidents all combined to give Brown
the impression that the Wildcats’ priorities were dif-
ferent from those of UNC.

Bill Cate, one of the leading Southern basketball
writers, talked with Brown just hours after the promis-
ing Wildcat mentor had resigned. According to Cate,
Brown felt that he had been led to believe that the
Davidson program was similar to the UNC program.
“Brown thought,” Cate later wrote, “that the school’s
lofty academic requirements would be: softened for
prospective recruits. . . .and also that the recruiting
budget. would be raised.”

Incidents concerning the Davidson basketball camp,
office carpeting, and his temporary residence in the
guest house also miffed Brown.

Brown was sent the bills for his temporary David-
son residence and the office carpeting, and, although
the college later paid the bills, it disillusioned him
further.

The incident concerning the basketball camp arose
when the college gave Driesell a large amount of
money to take the camp from under Lefty’s control.
Driesell had operated the camp for several years,
calling it the ‘Lefty Driesell Basketball Camp.” Last
year, before Driesell finally decided to go to Mary-
land, the majority of applicants for the camp had
already been accepted and Driesell had made plans
to once again be:at the helm. Therefore, when the
college gave some of the profits to Lefty, Brown
suffered.

Apparently it was Brown’s earlier association with
North Carolina that caused his downfall. It is -very
doubtful that any UNC head coach has been billed
for office carpeting or temporary housing or that
a Tar Heel mentor has had to worry about the likes
of recruiting budgets and strict academics.

Driesell had the temperment and ability to handle
the type problems that Davidson’s head basketball
coach faces. Brown also had motivation, but not like
Driesell’s. Driésell had his way, and Brown often did
not.

In short, it appears that the position of head basket-
ball coach at’ Davidson and Larry Brown ‘were not
suited for each other. :

So now, Brown is once again waiting for that ideal
job at the big-time basketball power to become avail-
able. : j

And Davidson) has another coach.

The team is led by Cliff

should be a strong candidate

escapes the injuries which
hampered him last season.

to an injury to his leg.
