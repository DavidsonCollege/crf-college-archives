CAT CHAT

By BUTCH PHARR

FRATERNITY TRAC

Proof that history repeats itself was evidenced last
in the inter-frat track mee. The Kappa Sigs not only we
the meet again with the KN. A.’s second sbut prod
new freshman star to-gain-the majority of their points.
time it was freshmen Tommy Peters who took
of the field events—namely, the shot put with a toss of 44 feet,
814 inches, the discus with a throw of 107 feet 1 inch, and
then the high jump by clearing the bar at 5 feet, 4 inches

Feature events of the meet the fraternity
broken this vear by Dick Miller, Bey Lacy, and Gene Bingham
Miller clipped nine seconds off the old record for the three-
quater mile run in one of the prettiest races seen on this
track_in a long time, his time being 3 minutes, 39 seconds.
3en Lacy breezed down the 100 yard stretch in the of 10 and
3-10 seconds to set another precedent closely followed by Ox
Pendleton. Gene Bingham set_a new record at 55 seconds on
the 440 yard run which is claimed by nearly every trackman
to be the most gruelling-one-on-the- schedule

CROSS COUNTRY

The distance runners for the varsity track journeyed
to Charleston, S. C., for the annual cross country meet
there in the heart of the city. The squad did well for
themselves, gaing a third place as a team. The ver-
satile athletes of Duke showed that they had not over-
looked cross country in their attempt to grab all of the
southern titles available by placing one, two, and three
across the line. Rufus Nimmons led the Davidson en-
tries by placing eighth with Jim Nichols right, behind
him in ninth spot. The winning team was decided by
the ones getting three men\across the finish line first,
no matter in what position.

TIME’ TRIALS

Coach Whittle ran off the first time trials for the ‘varsity
track team last Friday to size,up the current prospects. Dill
Lacy looked good in taking firsts in the 100:and 220 yard dashes,
and tieing with John Belk in the high jump when they both
went out at the same height. Taylor is still to be counted-on
for firsts in both hurdling events, with Glenn Terrell who is
first man in both the shot’ and discus throw. Rhea Dabney
captured the broad jump with a leap of 19 feet 7 and
while Gene Shannon is easily the number one man. in the
pole vault. The South Carolina Gamecocks will furnish the
Cats their first opposition on the Davidson track April first

Coach Whittle urges all the fraternities to run off
ponements as is necessary. The Inter-Class Soft Ball
Tournaments is coming up next and could be run off

in inter-class athletics for this year by winning the
volleyball tourney with no defeats.
