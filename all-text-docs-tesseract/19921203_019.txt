since I’ve been here,” McKillop
said. The ‘Cats hit 61% of their
shots from the field in taking a
commanding 61-35 lead.

By the time Imortal mounted
a late charge, Davidson had built
an insurmountable advantage.
Narat scored 32 points, and
Zimmerman notched 23; each hit
five three-pointers, as the Portu-
guese defenders played the pair
loosely all evening. Also impor-
tant was the success off of the fast
break, which was certainly a ques-
tion after point guard Frank Harris
chose not to return to Davidson
this year.

“Our goals were to develop a
winning attitude, to getexperience,
to get better and to find out if the
things we planned to do — run the
fast break and shoot the three-
pointer — would actually come to
pass. It was very clear that we
accomplished those goals today,”
McKillop concluded.

beas proficient with its long-range
shooting but should possess more
raw athletic ability than St.

Rugby Loses to Wake Forest in Championship

By Dack Stackhouse

Last Saturday the Davidson
Wildcats had the honor of hosting
Wake Forest for the Division II
State Championship match. Both
teams were extremely pumped up
for the game, as was evident by the
violent and sloppy rugby which
dominated the first half. Davidson,
unfortunately, was unable to orga-
nize itself in the first half of the
game. As a result, Davidson only
managed one try in the first half,
but it was a beauty. “Menacing
Mike” Kessler tore the ball loose
from one of the WFU players and
drove it into the try zone for five
points. However, that was the only
highlight in the half for Davidson

_ as Wake Forest went on a scoring

spree. With the score 22-7, there
was a lineout awarded to Wake
Forest near the try zone. Rafael
Candelario leaped high to win the
ball, bringing it down in the
Davidson try zone, thus, according
to the rules, giving WFU a scrum
down at the five meter line. How-
ever,a Demon Deacon managed to
get his hands on the ball, which
should not have mattered, but the
referee decided, erroneously, to
award WFU atry. Could this deci-
sion have anything to do with the

fact that the referee was Wake

half? We’ll never know. Wake

Forest managed to accumulate 30
points in the first half, as compared
to Davidson’s 7.

The second half of the game
was dominated by technically
sound rugby and complete sup-
pression of Wake Forest. The
Wildcats proved that they ARE
the best team in Division II play by
going on a scoring spree of their
own. After a beautiful blocked
kick by John Walsh, Davidson’s
eight man picked up the ball and
ran it in for the first try of the
second half. Shortly afterwards,
heads up play by Tom Shelburne
and Scotch Turner yielded another
try from aquick lineout. Shelburne
passed the ball in to Turner, who
taking two WFU defenders down,
passed the ball back to Shelburne
for an open run to the try zone.
Davidson kept the scoring momen-

tum going by playing constantly °

on the Wake side of the field. One
play yielded apass to Jim Tayberry,
who made a beautiful run from
near half field, faking out and
breaking tackles by five or six
people. Tayberry’s score, giving
the Wildcats a total of 24, proved
to be the last of the game as there

were only forty seconds remain-
ing.

Once Davidson settled down
into their own style of play, WFU
was hopeless. They did not even
come close to scoring in the sec-
ond half, but time ran out before
the Wildcats could mount the
comeback. Honorable mention is
deserved to everyone on the
Davidson team. Each person has

played a very important role in the
team’s best season in years. The
team can only improve in the
spring, and with a large number of
underclassmen ‘participating, the
future looks very bright for the
Wildcats. With a rested, healthy,
enthusiastic team returning, there
is no doubt that the Wildcats will
claim the State Title. It is just a
matter of time.
