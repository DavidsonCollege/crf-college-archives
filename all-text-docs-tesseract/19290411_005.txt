THE DAVIDSONIAN

“WILDCAT NINE LEAVES ON VIRGINIA TRIP |

THE LATEST
From Diamond and Cindoz.... .
Path
P. R. ALDERMAN

With the advent of April, King Basc-
ball assumes full sway in the world of
sports. The 'Cats have already gotten
well under way, however, although
with losses as well as wins. But it
must be admitted tkat the Red and
Black nine has some mighty bright
prospects, as was shown in the Cor-
nell game. The latter having given
Carolina a sound thrashing indicates
that it was an off day for our diamond
men and also that we'll prove this be-
fore the season advances much further.

There oughtn’t to be much kick
about that Wake Forest track
meet! It’s nothing to overlook—
amassing over a hundred points
against a college the size of Wake
Forest. And it sounds still better
when we remember that football
contest last fall, doesn’t it? V. P.
I. won a hard-fought contest from
the trackmen, but this victory
makes things look much better.

Well, the Kitten Nine won their first
game of the season, which is more
than the Varsity can boast, even tho’
it was from Cornelius. Curdts in the
box showed form for the first game.
Let's back the Fresh—there’s no rea-
son why they shouldn't have a big
season.

It has been stated that Davidson
has four of the best dashmen any-
where around. This was undoubt-
edly fulfilled by Whittle, Currie,
Kell and Brohard in the Wake
Forest and V. P. I. meets. Capt.
Currie is as speedy as ever if not
more so, and Whittle bids fair
to shatter a few more records be-
fore the season is over.

This is the week-end for the Tech
relays, and furthermore, judging from
the twenty or more entries, there’s
going to be some speed shown when
the best dashmen in the South com-
pete for honors. Everybody’s expect-
ing big things from Whittle and Cur-
rie and, seeing that they got twelve
points each in the Wake Forest meet,
we believe they'll have a lot to do with
showing that speed.

In spite of the fact that Wake
Forest got only two first places
you’ve got to hand it to Dupree,
who copped one of them, for hurl-
ing the javelin 165 feet and 5 ins.,
beating the Davidson record by
seven inches. Kinsey, winner of
the other first place,’ also deserves
credit. His distance in the broad
jump was 22 feet.

Rain didn’t seem to impair “Sleepy”
Goodson’s hitting power in the Oak
Ridge game. He connected for a
single and a triple out of three times
up. Goodson, who was first-sackman
on the Fresh nine last year, was one
of the most consistent hitters on the
squad, and he bids. fair to be a main-
stay in the ’Cats offensive this season.

That was a/great game “Buck”
Marrow twirler against the nine
from Cornell University! It’s no
easy thing to hold a big northern
team to no runs and only six scat-
tered hits. With Marrow, Proctor
and Goodson, Sophs, showing up
so well prospects are mighty bright
for the Wildcat nine during the
next few years.

CURRENT COMMENT

‘(Continued from pagez2)
Such smaller radiators have proved sey-
eral per cent more efficient than the
water-cooled type.

A good many Americans who flew in
the World War are now in Mexico look-
ing for excitement. .They hire themselves
out to whichever side offers the best
price and enter the service with high sal-
aries. It remains to be seen what will
happen when Americans of opposite sides
meet in aerial conflict.

If the new thirteen-month calendar is
adopted with four weeks for each month,
the old ryhme might be changed to read:
“Twenty-eight days has September,

April, June: and November
All the rest have 28 days, -
Except February, which has 28 days.”

“And, now, sir,” thundered the fawyer,
“tell the court what you were doing in
the interim.”

“I didn’t go there,” was the angry
reply. “I stayed in the living-room the
whole evening.”

time that that event has been won in by
any of the Wildcat sprinters this year.

168, 5 inches, to easily top his competitors

Fresh Nine Wins
Second Straight

Belmont Abbey Defeated in Con-
test of Many Runs

The Davidson freshman baseball team
defeated the Belmont Abbey nine in a
very erratic game last Monday. This
was the second game of the season for
the Fresh and each team was guilty of
many errors and loose plays.

Mathis and Bradshaw were the heavy
hitters for Davidson, each collecting a
double and a triple. For the visitors
Eiserhardt collected most hits.

The game was featured by many hits
as well as a number of errors, neither
team contributing any brilliant fielding.

Dash Men to Enter
Relays at Ga. Tech

The Davidson Track Team will be
represented at the Georgia Tech Relays
in Atlanta on April 13 by 5 or 6 of its
most select members. In addition to the
Sprint Medley Relay in which Brohard,
Kell, Currie and Lafferty running the
440, 220, and 880 yard division respec-
tively, will be entered, Currie will very
likely run the 100 yard dash and Whittle
the hurdles.

Any track team in the country may
enter the meet so there will probably be
a large number of entrants. Captain
Pritchett stated that he might take some
of the field men but that it was doubtful
on account of the
involved,

Inthe recent cigarette test mad at
the University, O.p GoLps were
chosen by the students as the best.
The cigarettes were masked by
black labels so that the names of
the brands were concealed. Each
label was numbered. This was
judged to be the most sporting way
of testing the merits of the four
leading brands. Some 208 Yale
students were asked to smoke the
four disguised brands without
knowing their identity.

OLD GOLD CIGARETTES WIN
FIRST IN TESTS AT YALE

They were merely to choose, by
number, the one that was most
appealing to the taste.

The News supervised the test
on January 18 at various fraternity
houses and in the News office.

When the votes were recorded
it was discovered that OLp Gop
(Cigarette No. 3) had won. Old
Gold was given 63 first choices,
which was 11 per cent ahead of
Cigarette No. 2, 34 per cent ahead
of Cigarette No. 1, and 53 per cent
ahead of Cigarette No. 4.
