Students win ’88-’89

calendar changes

Davidson to have seven exam days

By FRANK FOLGER
and WALT REYNOLDS
The Student Government As-

sociation won a significant vic-
tory last week when the Execu-
tive Committee of the Faculty
approved the addition of an
extra exam day for each exam
period in the 1988-89 school
calendar.

The 1988-89 curriculum calen-
dar now includes seven exam
days for each period instead of
the previously determined six
days. The changes for the fall
and spring examinations are the
following:

, * The final day of the fall ex-
amination period will be ‘on
Thursday, December 22nd,
rather’ than ‘Wednesday, De-
cember 21st;

¢ The spring semester will
begin on Tuesday, January

. 10th, one day earlier than previ-

ously scheduled;
The spring examination pe-
riod dates will be from Wednes-

day, May 3rd to Wednesday,

May 10th, with Tuesday May
2nd switching from a class day
toareadingday.  _—_.

Conrad Doenges and SGA rep-
resentatives Doug Hicks, Harri-

were asked to speak to their”

New dorms’ site chosen; Belk parking lot safe

By TOBY TRUOQG.

Three new student dormito-
ries will be constructed ona site
_just to the southwest of the Cov-
ington golf facility, the
Davidson College administra-
tion decided this week. The
three-story buildings will house
a total of 144 students and will
cost an estimated $2.75 million
to construct.

The site near the golf course

was chosen over two other pro--

posed sites, one on the north-

_ western corner of Patterson
Court and the other in the area
currently occupied by the Belk
dormitory parking lot. Stu-
dents had expressed some con-
cern over. the parking lot site
proposal, which was rejected
because a consultant to the col-
lege recommended that the site
would be better suited to other
future use.

Other factors in the choice of
the site included proximity to
the student activity areas, dis-
tance from the academic build-
ings, and student opinion. ©

“Thé student opinion, as it
was expressed to me, was that

. the dorms should be a little far

away, but not completely out of

the picture,” said Dean of Stu-

dents Will Terry.

Director of Facilities Plan-
ning Grover Meetze said that
construction plans are unclear
at thistime. “We had planned to
have them ready for occupation
next September,” he said, “but
the changes we’ve made in the
design and delay in picking a
site will make that more diffi-
cult.” :

- Currently, the only obstacles
standing in the way of construc-
tion are changes in design. The
original plan that called for four
two-story dormitories has been
modified to call for three three-
story dorms. Meetze said that
the changes will make better
use of the available land and
will facilitate construction.

“We hope that the design
changes can be made quickly
enough so that they [the dorms]

can be completed by September
1989,” said Meetze...—

Floor plans for the residence
halls have not changed. Tom
Jennings, Director of Resi-
dence Life, said that each floor

will be divided into four suites, .

each of which. will house four -

students. Each suite will have
single bedrooms and acommon
living room, kitchen, and bath-
room. “The plan compliments
our efforts to facilitate more
Student interaction in small
communities,” he said.

The dirt road that currently
runs from Patterson Court to
Ridge Road will be rerouted
closer to the tennis courts.
Meetze said that the culvert for

- the creek running through Pat-

terson Court will probably be

extended toward theeastsothat |

parking spaces forthe residence
halls can be built.

Taking into consideration
these additional costs, as well as
others related to the distance of
the new dorms from utilities
and the topography of the area,
Meetze estimated that the proj-
ect will cost roughly $2.75
million.

The new site does not lend

—itself to another addition in the

immediate area because of its,
variable topography. However,
Meetze does not rule out the
possibility of construction in
the Belk parking lot or other

areas.

What lies in the future for
Davidson College housing and
for the size of Davidson Col-
lege? Looking beyond meeting
the immediate need to have on-
campus housing for all stu-
dents, is the college preparing
for an increase in enrollment?

According to Dean Terry, a
plan for gradual growth has
been discussed. “We are con-
sidering an addition of about
ten more students per year. This
is flexibility that we want to
