TROTTER’S TRAGIC TRIUMPH. Bill Trotter evokes 8
cornucopia of tears from Virginia Cornue as the Vagabonds pre-

iod of the red scare following.

World War I.

The indignation aroused by
their alledged treatment was
world wide: There was a riot
in Boston; American embassies
were stoned in Europe and
South America.

Set in the slums of New
York City, WINTERSET is e
poetic tragedy contrasting
light and derkness in its cher-
acterizations. The sets and
lighting will carry out this
theme of light and darkness,
combining realistic effects
with the abstract.

All the characters are a part
of the “darkness” except Mio
(Bill Trotter) and Mariamne
(Virginia Cornue). Other char-
acters include Jon Miller as

Joe Howell. Garth; Bill Den-

Nance Schedules
Gritar Program:

Fred Nance, classical and
flamenco guitarist, will hold a
concert sponsored by the YMCA
Monday evening, Dec. 10, from
8 until 9:30 in the Morrison
Room of the College Union.

Nance, who lives in Charlotte,
is a professional guitarist who
has studied under Andrea Se-
govia and Sophocles Papas.

‘Besides playing the guitar,
Nance also collects and builds
them. ‘His collection of thirty-
four guitars includes a Remerez
and a Hauser. both of which he
will use in the program..

Until the time of Segovia the
guitar was associated primarily
with Spanish folk music and
dances. Segovia, however,
troduced classical selections to
the modern guitarist.

Nance will present a program
in two parts with an intermis-
sion between each section. The
concert will be divided into
classical and traditional selec.
tions.

Nance will explain each piece
before he plays it; and if time
allows It, he will take requests
from the audience.

There is no admission, and
the program will be open to

Freshmen will be eligible.

During their regular bi-veek-
ly meeting the members of Sig
Up read and criticize some of
their own works. There are also
several special mectings and ac-
tivities each semester.

Sig Up plans to have a joint
meeting with Queens to read
some of their writings at meet-
ings of Eumenean Literary So-
ciety later this semester.

The 22 members have tenta-
tiove plans of publishing some
of their writings in a memo-
type book:

lbasketball game between the

Davidson faculty and the Queens
faculty, with faculty cheerlead-
ers from both Queens and Dav-

lidson.

Although all Union facilities
will be open during the game,
the party itself will begin
immediately after the game
is over. Except for the Snack
Bar, Student Store, and the
Knovel Knook, all activities
are free.

Among the featured enter-
tainment of the evening will be
three bands. In the Morrison
Room the Aaron Hinson Quin-
tet will play slow music, while
in the cafeteria the Dynamics
will play only for twisting. In
the “Cave” the Sid Farrar Trio
will hold a beatnik session of
progressive jazz and modern
poetry readings in which any-
one may participate.

The Green Room will be the
center of Christmas carolling.
Harry Causey will be at the elec-
tric organ while Dr. Donald

will lead the carols for anyone
who wants to sing.

had imitators. Dr. Joseph Drake,
professor of sociology, and other
citizens of Davidson and even
of Cornelius began to build
shelters in that fall of 1961. Dav-
idson College supposedly be-
came concerned at the same
time.

President D. G. Martin, Busi-
ness Manager Fobert Currie,
Physical Plant Director Grover
Meetze, and Dr. John I. Hopkins,
physics professor, formed a
“nucleus” of a committee to
investigate shelter sites for the
college.

The flurry of activity in the
bomb shelter hobby was duly
recorded by THE DAVIDSON.
AN. But since that time the
news voice of the college has
been silent on the matter.
But the silence did not come
from poor reporting.

The only action the college
has taken since about one year
‘ago has been to make a survey
of the buildings on campus to
see if shelter areas could be
found and to wait on the re
ports of a similiar survey made
of the campus by the govern-
ment.

The government survey re-
vealed that most of the larger
buildings on campus could be
used for shelters. Currie said
that he was not sure at the time
exactly how shelters would be
built into the buildings. “I as-
sume hallways in most of the
buildings such as Chambers
would have to be used for shel-

In short, the college now
stands exactly where it stood
one year ago when it made a
half-hearted attempt to fol-
low Dr. Maloney, except for
the fact of the surveys.

But, despite the only half-
hearted discipleship, Davidson
takes great delight in pointing
out the fact that, “We are as
well off as any college in the
matter of preparations for
atomic attack.” Those were the
words of Robert Currie last
Wednesday morning.

The fact is, however, a few
schools report that shelters on
their campuses have been
marked and food and water
preparations have been made.

Last Thursday, the four-man
nucleus held a meeting which
has produced only one new re-
sult. The committee decided to
meet with representatives of
Civil Defense to see if the gov-
ernment will stock shelters
here. Currie said, however, “I
don’t think that a compromise
with them will be likely.”
The rule is now that any gov-
ernment-supplied shelters would
have to become open to the pub-
lic.

college stockpiling food and
water is the money it would
take to maintain such sup-
plies for every student here.
4 don’t know what we will
do about this,” Currie lament-
ed. “I would hate to say that
you and every student should
pay a fee of $36 dollers so
that we coufd stockpile pro-
visions for you. That may
have to be done if a satisfac-
tory plan cannot be worked
out with Civil Defense.”

Currie did say that the col-
lege might leave it up to the
students to pay the money vol-
untarily. “We may buy a num-
ber of survival kits costing
about. $36 each, and then sell
them to students who desire to
be protected.”

But, as students have already
observed about machinery on
The Hill, the wheels turn slow-
ly. Whether or not Davidson will |
ever be ready to meet an atomic
attack when and if it comes is
not known at this time, but the
time when it will appears to
be a long way off.

And as far as that $36 from

lege in the “bomb shelter re-
