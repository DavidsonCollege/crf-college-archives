The Davidsonian

The Davidson Biology
Department announced on Friday
that it will make a fundamental
change to its curriculum next
semester, departing from a stan-
dard classroom principle that has
been in place for the last 54 years.

“Spring semester of 2006 will
see a biology department that is
willing to adapt to
fit the needs of the
current sociopolit-
ical scene and
offer a more
diverse spectrum
of knowledge to
our students,”
said Chair of
Biology William
Warburton.

The department
has a list of some
26 alterations in
general curricu-
lum requirements,
but the notable departure from
previous years is the addition of
the concept of “intelligent design”
to every class.

“Too long Davidson has been
trapped in a sort of worship of the
tangible, the finite, the mundane.
Science needs to embrace a broad-
er perspective, one that includes
the possibility, even the probabili-
ty of some power beyond our
capacity to measure,” explained
Warburton.

According to the administration,
the change comes in part as a con-
cession to critics of Davidson who
claim that the school fails to sup-
port its Presbyterian heritage with
policies that take religion into
account.

Although secretly, many suspect

that this was part of a compromise
reached between John Belk and
the college after their falling out
over the trustee issue.

Some faculty are skeptical about
the new policy. Robert W.
Killingham Professor of Religion
Janessa Bean wonders why
addressing religious issues is nec-

Pin worn by students who petitioned for the teaching of the “intelli-
gent design” theory of human origin last year.

essary in a science department.
“In my course on Modern
Science and Christianity, I deal
with issues like evolution versus
intelligent design all the time.
That’s my field, that’s what the
course is about. Science does not
have the same need for compro-
mise with, or even consideration of
the opposite side of the philosoph-
ical debate. Those scientists had
better step off my turf before I bust
out my riding lawnmower.”
Associate Professor of
Philosophy Charlie McPherson
agrees with Bean: “Science is about
cold, hard facts. By allowing spec-
ulative theories with no substanti-
ation to be seen as legitimate, the
Biology Department is setting up
students to believe in idle conjec-

ture as much as they believe in lab-
oratory-proven results. What’s

next? Will we have to allow laugh- -

ter into a science class?
on my watch.”

Professor of Biology Farrell
Johansson says she is happy with
the change, as it will provide a new
direction for class discussion, say-
ing, “I’m excit-
ed. Discussion
will finally have
a_real range of
opinion, from
the traditional
Darwinian the-
ories to the pos-
sibility that the
first anatomi-
cally modern
female human
was made from
a male’s rib.”

Johansson
hints she may
even stop requiring weekly labs for
Biology 112—a course once titled
“Organisms, Evolution, and
Ecosystems” that will become
“Order, Divine Hierarchy, and the
Chosen Species.”

Geology professor Terrance
Wentworth is also looking forward
to teaching classes with intelligent
design theories. “As a geologist, of
course I don’t give any credence to
the theories,” explained Dr.
Wentworth, “but the teaching of
Young Earth theories means I have
far less material I have to prepare.”

The overall student reaction to
the new curriculum is also posi-
tive. Biology major Amelia Burton
’07 said, “I was considering chang-
ing to a philosophy major after
having to deal with too many facts

Well not

and lab results this semester. I
wasn’t even able to go out on the
weekends I had so much work.
Now that I can take some intelli-
gent design classes, which count
towards my major, I’ll actually
have some free time. Instead of
staying in on Friday night typing
up a 12-page lab report, I can just
jot down a few Bible quotes and
then start throwing them back.”

Dean of Academic Affiars Albert
Rodriguez points to the Biology
Department as a harbinger of
Davidson’s new direction, which
he claims is one of reaction against
modern academic fads.

“Instead of staying
in on Friday night.
can just jot down a

few Bible quotes and
then start throwing
them back.”

“Things like falsifiable experi-
mental design, repeatability of
demonstrations, even the so-called
scientific method—these are all
products of a twentieth-century
homogenization of academia,” said
Rodriguez. “Davidson should
stand apart from all these institu-
tions that just follow the herd; we
will strive to be a sanctuary for
original and provocative academic
thought. And if Harvard,
Princeton, and Williams all stick
their noses up at us, what should
we care? God will smite them.”

I have not attended many stu-
dent-run discussion groups at
Davidson, but the advertisement
in The Crier for the pornography
program really caught my eye.
Every other topic that I have seen
did not look very interesting; they
are always “Iraq this,” or “God
that.”

Finally, here’s a panel on some-

those great moments where the
conversation was really flowing,
and you realize how intelligent and
insightful your fellow classmates
are.

“Ewww, how does that even fit in

Sure, the chocolate and eheese
were good, but the only drink they
put out was a gallon of milk. Don’t
get me wrong; I like milk, but it
doesn’t exactly go well with hard-
core pornography.
