THE DAVIDSONIAN

By MIKE (CHAPMAN
Staff Writer

The wrestling team came home for the
first time in two weeks this past Saturday,
only to fall 40-3 to a strong Chattanooga
squad.

The Wildcats took on The Citadel last
night, and although more players contributed
winning decisions, the result was still a dis-
appointing 32-10 defeat.

The loss was the third in a row for the
*Cats, who have now dropped their overall
record to 6-8-1 and their league record to 1-
3-1.

Chattanooga managed to earn victories in
nine of the 10 total bouts in the first match.
Seven of these nine victories were either by
major decision or by fall. The Mocs are
undefeated in the league at 3-0.

The lone victory for the Wildcats came
from Marcus Boyd ’07 in the 174 pound
match. Boyd earned a 5-3 decision over
Chattanooga’s T.J. Sayers.

Boyd, who has now won nine straight
matches for the Wildcats, improved his
record to 12-1 for the season.

“Chattanooga is a tough team, but there’s
no way they should have beat us that bad,”
said co-captain Matt Leonard ’06. “Some of
us made a lot of mistakes, but it’s nothing
that can’t be fixed before March.”

Although the loss was clearly a tough one
for the team, the majority of the Wildcat
wrestlers have learned from it and have
already set their sights on the conference
tournament in March.

“It was a good learning experience for the
team since a lot of the UT-C guys are the
ones we need to knock off at the conference
tournament in March,” said Boyd. ‘“‘We did-

The golf team traveled to Orlando, FI. to

compete at the Rio Pinar Intercollegiate >”

hosted by the University of Central Florida
in its opening match of the spring season.
The Wildcats completed the tournament tied
for 14th place.

The first day, David Fowler ’09 shot a 75,
putting him at the top Wildcat spot and only
three over par.

After shooting a 40 on the front nine,
Fowler shot only managed a 35 on the back
nine to put him in 16th out of the 90 individ-
ual spots.

Other Davidson golfers include Alex
Knoll ’07, who shot a 77 and is now in 41st
place in the individual spots.

Steve Mayo ’07 and Tim Dillion ’06 came
in just above 80 with respective scores of 81
and 82.

Michael Saari ’09 walked away from the
first round with 80. His next two rounds
were 76 and 70, giving him the lowest three-
day total for any Davidson golfer.

The match concluded yesterday morning
with the final round of the 54 hole event.
Saari led the team with a 76 and a two-under
70 and helped to bring the Wildcats to a tie
for 14th place. Knoll finished a stoke back
from Saari and now both men are tied for
38th.

The golf team will continue its season
when the Wildcats compete in the Wexford
Plantation Intercollegiate on Feb. 26-28 in
Hilton Head, SC.

Mocs take down grapplers 40-3

n’t let the loss get us down; it’s just motiva-
tion for the rest of our season.”

On Tuesday night, the grapplers traveled
to Charleston, SC, and once again fell in a
conference match to The Citadel, 32-10.

Patrick Coman ’06 (125) scored a major
decision to beat his opponent.

Leonard (149) and Matt Pendle ’08 (157)
each contributed a winning decision to
accrue the Wildcats some points in the com-
petition.

The Bulldogs improved to 3-2-0 in the
Southern Conference

For the senior wrestlers, the two dual
matches and the conference tournament is all
they have left in their athletic careers: at
Davidson. And for many, this is an abrupt
realization.

“As far as having only two dual matches

left, as a team, it hasn’t really hit us yet that
the season’s almost over,” added Boyd. “It
seems like we’ve just started to get into a
good rhythm.”

The wrestlers host James Madison and
Duquesne this Sunday to cap off their dual
season.

“We’ve already accomplished so much
this season as a team,” added Leonard.
“There’s no reason we can’t finish out the
year on a good note.”

Sending the seniors out on a good note is
just as important to the underclassmen as
well.

“It hasn’t hit me yet that the seniors only

have three dual matches left in their careers,”
said Boyd. “They will be sorely missed.”

Wrestling begins on Sunday at 1 p.m. in
‘Belk Arena.

Basketball, from page 16

Jason Morton ’06 showed excellent
resiliency by coming off a knee injury
and one day’s rest to contribute 27 points
and set a team record for 100 percent
three-point shooting, going 6-6 from
beyond the arc.

The Wildcats also got key minutes
from Andrew Lovedale ’09 and Eric
Blancett ’06, who combined for nine
rebounds, four of them offensive. The
two averaged just 10.5 minutes between
them.

“Jason Morton played spectacularly,
and | think that Lovedale had his best
game in a Davidson uniform,” said
McKillop. “When you get your bench
making those contributions, you are
going to be successful.”

Johnson continued to be strong inside
as he racked up 19 points and 10
rebounds for his fourth double-double of
the season.

The Wildcats performed well on the

boards as a team as they out-rebounded the
Citadel 44-27 and picked off 16 offensive
rebounds, giving them second chances and
providing psychological daggers to the
defense.

The story of this game, however, is the
emergence of a team leader that has been
sorely lacking all season.

Jason Morton has demonstrated that
despite not being a starter, he will emotional-
ly and physically lead this Wildcat squad
with hot shooting, unrelenting defense, and
contagious hustling.

Perhaps one of the keys of Davidson’s
struggles this season has been the inability to
take pressure off of the shots of Winters and
McKillop and allow them to play wide open
basketball.

Morton has stepped into that role now and
defenses can no longer focus on a single out-
side or inside threat but rather must contend
with a slasher whose ability to shoot and
spread the ball around makes the Wildcat
offense all the more dangerous.

Morton has also provided the defensive

spark to pressure opponents on the ball
and create quick-scoring transition oppor-
tunities.

On Monday, the Wildcats showed that
despite the toughness of their opponents,
they can overcome a deficit and pick up a
win in a hostile environment.

Perhaps it is no coincidence that the
Wildcats have only been able to do that on
the road in Charleston, S.C.

The Southern Conference tournament
looms large on the horizon, and the
Wildcats want to establish momentum
and good play in the historic Southern
city.

Despite their four conference losses,
Davidson remains in the thick of the
Southern Conference race for first place
as they. are one game behind Georgia
Southern and Elon, who sit with tied
records at 9-3.

Facing fourth-place Furman on
Saturday at Belk Arena, Davidson will
look to exact revenge from their January
road loss to the Paladins.
