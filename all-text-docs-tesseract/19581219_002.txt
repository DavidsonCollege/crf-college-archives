Unwritten Rules

Professor Goodykoontz’s clash
with the “unwritten rules” was un-
fortunate.

Equally unfortunate was the wide-
spread rumor that Dean Bailey had
attempted to dictate to Dr. Goody-
koontz’s specific teaching methods.
There is, of course (see page one) no
foundation whatever for such a ru-
mor. The widely circulated false story
had the administration fitting easily
into the role of the villain intent on
squashing the efforts of the profes-
sor to improve the quality of his
courses.

This was not the case at all.

But Dr. Goodykoontz was in fact
squashed, not by the administration
as supposed by many, but just as ef-
fectively by a set of unwritten, nebul-
ous rules.

We see no sound reason why he
should not be allowed to éxperiment
with a “free cut” system, or hold his

Block Innovator

classes or any part of his classes as
seminars, providing he is convinced
that the ultimate result will be high-
er quality academic work.

As we see it, the purpose of any
rule in a college should be to aid in
the learning process. If a rule, wheth-
er written or unwritten, fails to do
this, or. even worse, hinders this pro-
cess, which is the heart of any col-
lege, it should be junked immediate- |
ly.

We believe that any rule restrict-
ing the conscientious efforts of a
dedicated and imaginative teacher
such as Dr. Goodykoontz falls in the
“hindrance” category.

The DAVIDSONIAN urges the
Curriculum Gommittee to get to work
and find out just what the rules re-
garding seminars are, if any exist,
and then to make it possible for Dr.
Goodykoontz to resume his forward
looking programs..

Meaning Of
Gift Fund Vote

The real meaning of the over-
whelming student vote on the Gift
Fund is open to various interpreta-
tions, and it is difficult to say just
what went on in the minds of most
students when they cast their ballots
in favor of providing scholarships for
Negro ministerial candidates.

Certainly a large part of the credit
must go to Rev. Lawrence Bottoms’
very able presentation of the plan.
He won the attention and respect of
the student body in a way that chapel
speakers are rarely able to do.

Ilowever. the real interest of. the
matter is what it reveals of the un-
derlying attitudes of Davidson stu-
dents towards the race issue.

It cannot. of course. be construed
as a full endorsement of the liberal
view of the race problem in the South;
integration as such was not involved.
But.it is a hopéful sign that most stu-
dents have indicated their willingness
to appropriate money to help meet
the need for well-trained religious
leaders in the Southern Negro com-
munity.

Recent events have shown that
Negro ministers (such as the Rev.
Martin Luther King in Montgomery)
have been in the vanguard of pro-
gress toward establishing the kind of
race relations which will benefit both
white and Negro communities. It is
encouraging that the generally con-
servative students of a Southern
white college have taken a step which
will help this movement.—C.H.C.

Agnes Scott
Takes Stand

Since the statement by 250 Emory
University professors deploring the
closing of public schools in the South,
faculty members at another promi-
nent Southern institution have taken
a stand on this issue. °

Last week seventy-three faculty
members (about ninety-seven _per-
cent) at Agnes Scott College issued a
public statement declaring that the
cessation of public education in order
to avoid racial integration would be
disastrous, resulting in the loss of
“people qualified for work demand-
ing special training,” as well as in
the spread of illiteracy. Ultimately,
they said, “a great proportion of our

people would have little or no edu-
cation.” ,
The immediate occasion of both
of these declarations was a local con-
troversy concerning the_ public
schools in Atlanta, but they have at-
tracted notice all over the South as
courageous expressions of modera-
tion at a time when the vision of
many has been clouded over by deep-
ly ingrained prejudice and by the |
actions of irresponsible politicians. |
Intellectuals and academicians
have often been caricatured as being |
timid, impractical inhabitants of the |
ivory tower. unwilling or unable to
act when action is required. The
faculties of Emory and Agnes Scott
have shown that this generalization is |
a false one: at some colleges.—C H.C. |

Food Service

Improvements

In past issttes of the DAVIDSON-
LAN. certain criticisms of the Union
cafeteria and snack bar food and ser-
vice have appeared in this editorial
column. At the time they were made
these complaints were fully justified, |
but since they appeared, distinct im-
provements have taken place.

We may mention particularly the |
increased cleanliness in the snack ;
bar, and also the excellent Thanksgiv-
ing and Christmas dinners given meal
ticket holders in the cafeteria.

Mr. Michaei Stephanos, manager
of the cafeteria and snack bar, de-
serves the appreciation of the student
body for his willingness to respond to
criticism with solid improvements.

Being A Senior
Comes Subtly

Old age and being a senior comes
in subtle ways. During the conversa-
tion which accompanies the Wednes-
day night process of creating a paper,

the name “John Harmon” was men-
tioned. .
One sophomore member of the

Staff inquired with a puzzled expres-
sion, “Who is John Harmon? Did he

go to Davidson?”
Amazed Seniors gasped. How

could anyone forget the man who in-
troduced the black umbrella, read
five Janguages, turned down a Phi
Bete bid, and nearly drove his Bible
professor to atheism?

The realization came: the Sopho-
more hadn't forgotten; he had never
known.

Worriedly, we searched for gray-
ing hair.

Delegates To National IFC
Convention Report Events

At the National Interfraterni was the atmosphere in ‘which

ty Conference held in Atlanta,
Georgia on December fifth and
sixth, the Davidson fraternity
system was represented by two
members of the LF.C. and Dean
Bailey. This conference includ-
ed undergraduate representa-
tives from 48 states and Cana-
da and has been established as
an annual international inter-
fraternity workshop.

MUTUAL EXCHANGE

Its objective and purpose is
to promote the ideals of fra-
ternities and cxamine their
problems through discussion
and mutual exchange. of ideas.

In addition to the undergrad-
uate representation, there was
also the graduate representa-
tion made up of the deans of
many of our leading institu-
tions and all the national fra-
ternity officers.

the conference there seemed to
prevail a sincere interest and
enthusiasm in an effort to ex-
change as many ideas as pos-
sible. The topics were all per-
tinent to the interfraternity

ered and the solutions through-
out the nation. :

The Davidson representation

cussions of fraternity problems

at Davidson is unique and fa-

vored with the absence of some

national fraternity problems
absent here at Davidson are the
anti-fraternity sentiments of
some administrations, the
struggle of fraternity systems

campuses and the management

JUSTIFY POSITIONS

In addition many fraternities
are being forced to justify their
position on the college campus
in an effort to perpetuate their
existence.

Among the topies discussed
pertinent to the Davidson sys-
tem were scholarship, fraterni-
ty ideals, Help or Greek Week,

bidding systems, rushing and
social organization and their
promotion and organization
from the interfraternity level.

BIDDING SYSTEMS

In regard to the bidding sys-
tems discussed the Davidson
delegates observed that many
schools already have in prac-
tice the revised system now un-
der consideration at Davidson
with minor adjustments.

The discussion of Icip or
Greck Week also affordect the
representatives ideas which
will help the LF.C. this ‘year
in the introduction of its first
Greek Weck,

HELL WEEK OUT

It was ‘interesting to find out
that in most of the best schools
around the nation Hell Weeks
have been done away with for
several years and Greek or in-
doctrination weeks. have re-
placed them.

The conference was indeed
beneficial to the Davidson
LF.C. by nature of the topics
diseussed and the manner in
which they were discussed.
With the ideas abstained at the
conference it is felt that the
Davidson I.F.C. will be better
qualified in its work and ac-
tivities.

Report From Hocsaks:
“Money Gives Hope’

(Editor’s Note:)

The following letter was
read to the Student Body,
Tuesday morning. It is from
the Steve Hocseks, the Hun-
garian family brought to the
Davidson community by the
Gitt Fund two years ago.)

We have soon been living in
Davidson for two years and we
are happy to let you know of
our progress. We arrived here
with only two syiteases and the
clothing which we wore. But
because of your concern and
benevolence, we have been
muchly blessed.

DRAFTSMAN

I am working as an electrical
draftsman and engineer with
the J. N. Pease Construction
Company in Charlotte. This job
I received through the help of
Mr. Grier Martin. I am perfect-
ing also several inventions on
which I wish to receive patents.

My wife has received a job
at Ivey’s Department Store. We
now rent a small house on
South Thompson Street, which
is comfortably furnished with
furniture provided by the Gift

Fund and Davidson College.

A NEW FREEDOM

America has been good to us,
as we have warm clothes, good
food, and jobs which we en-
joy doing. But more than these
things, we appreciate a free-
dom which we did not know be-
fore in Hungary.

We do not have to ask the
government where we can go
or where we can work. We do
not have to be afraid that our
neighbors or colleagues at work
are spies for the police.

MONEY GIVES HOPE

Please remember as you give
your Gift Fund each year that
you do more than give money.
For whatever cause it is given,
your money gives new hope. It
aids someone to achieve a
dream or an ambition which by
himself he could not do.

So at this Christmas time.
not only de we thank you for
giving us a new life in your
town. We also ask you to give
generously to the 1958 Gift
Fund.

THE SPECTATOR

Yes, Euphemia

There IS a Santa

By TOM KERNAN

The following letter came to me in yesterday’s morning

postal delivery:
Dear Mr. Spectator,

I am 19 years old; 1 date a Davidson Man. The other
night he told me that there is no Santa Claus. At first, I
didn’t believe him, but I can’t stop worrying about what
he said. Please tell me, is there a Santa Claus?

Sincerely yours,
Euphemia Bullard

Yes, Euphemia, there is a Santa Claus. Let me tell
you of my own personal experience with him. The other
night as I lay asleep in my room, I was suddenly awakened

by the sound of bells.

“Chapel, clothes, can’t go naked,” I mumbled to my-;
self as I sprang from my bed; I paused. “Dark,” I thought,
“no chapel at night. What the—” (Here the door to my
room flew open, revealing none other than old Chris
Cringle himself.) But me oh my, Euphemia, you would
hardly have recognized him. He was dressed all in red,
quite true, but it was a neat, red flannel suit, the jacket
being a darker shade of herring-bone scarlet and trimmed
with tiny bells. Instead of boots, he wore low-cut shoes,

fastened with buckles.

“Pardon me,” he said, in well modulated tones, “my
name is Christopher Cringle. ’'m terribly sorry to dis-
turb you, but ’'m on my way to Charlotte and I’ve lost
my way. Can you tell me how to get there?”

“] thought you were a myth,” I said, “but there real-

ly is a Santa Claus.”

“Yes,” he said, “if you must use the old, vulgarized

term.” ,

“But where is your traditional outfit? You look so
different from the usual pictures.”

“Dear me,” he said with a little laugh,” you -are
quaint, aren’t you. Of course I used to be different; but,
my boy, in order for me to operate, people have to be-
lieve in me. I’ve changed; I'm a New Santa for a Modern

Faith.

“The Modern Mind has re-interpreted the meaning of
Christmas, broadened its outlook; the old concepts served

a purpose, but they were rather crude and sentimental.
You might say that we connected with Christmas have
retrenched: we've produced a Modern Christmas that will
enable a man to reconcile his new ideas with a Yuletide
Season. After all, there’s really no conflict between Christ-

mas and Materialism.”

—Yes, Eunhemia, I wish I had space to tell you more
about him, but, my dear, [ think you can safely believe

in him. Yes, there is a Santa Claus — and Merry Christ-
mas, Euphemia,

In The Late-Day,

‘Down on my knees, Lord, down on my knees,

She sang while she picked, and the juice from the
strawberries ran like diluted blood from her stubby fin-

gertips.

“That's pickin’ some berries,
sonny, she said as she handed
me a quart basket across the
ankle-high row of plants.
“We'll put ‘em all over on yo’
side so we won't miss any
pickin’ ‘em up in the wheel-
barrow.”

She turned up a cluster of
the red, bright berries in her
‘hand end beamed, “Look at
that. Ain‘t they beauties?”
When ( agreed with her
smile it broadened and the
cluster was in the basket be-
fore | could blink good.

“All day ain't easy, son, and
they ‘spect me to give ‘em
away. ‘You sellin’ too high,’
they say, them doctors and peo-
ple that got mo’ money'n they
ean ever use. An’ they’re 45
cents down 't the market.”

She rose slowly with one
crooked hand on the top of
her hip to help straighten
her back. Off her knees now,
the knots in her sixty-year-
old legs wore visible, and the
puffed out veins. A tear in
‘the bottom of her dress,
too. “Look af that: I'll be
nekked if | bend down much
more.”

But she didn't get “nekked”
and her squat body did a pow-
erful Jot more bending. “Picked
15 quarts off that row behind
you in an hour yesterday,” she
said proudly, “and Mr. Gran-
ger wouldn't believe me. He
took me into town yesterday
and brought me back.” She had
no car, not even a wagon to

hitch behind her mule, which
kicked impatiently inside the
old rusted shed to the north of
the strawberry patch. “Wants
to go to the spring,” she said.

The mid-afternoon wind
made dry whirlpools out of
the dust, and the smoke grey
soil dried for water.

“Makes my heart ache,” she
said and looked behind her at
the three more rows of berries
she wouldn't get a chance to
pick. “And things is tight on us
ol’ folks out here. Gotta’ get
that corn replanted in front the
house, too.”

The house was weather-
brown and old. “Gotte’ move

Put on my side and bowed
her head back in her work,

Things were quiet for a
while, and in the silence the
slanting sun shone on the bent,
short back. The weather-brown
house with kerosene lamps on
the wood stove, and the rusted
shed, and the rotting hand-plow
stared mutely into the blank
sky.

One wonders about this aca-
demic and social maze in which
we are trying to find a pattern.
Can it fit into a larger scheme
of things, or are we separating
ourselves from a wider and
more challenging world?
