said that no action can be taken by
the PCC because thereare no guide-
lines for flyer content in the by-
laws. She doesn’t expect legisla-
tion to be introduced dealing with
this topic because it would be dif-
ficult for the PCC to-regulate all
fliers, especially since the PCC
concentrates on the aicohol policy.
Adams feels that fraternities should
use their common sense in creat-
ing party flyers, and take into con-
sideration that the party is being
co-sponsored by a women’s house.

Adams also mentioned that a
“slap on the wrist” by the PCC
wouldn’t be nearly as effective as
the negative publicity and finan-
cial loss already resulting from the
incident. She said, “We hit them in
the purse strings.”

However, Adams commented
that if she were approached by
several people supporting the ad-
dition of new legislation in the by

be brought up before the council.

SAE President Powell Spears
said, “I’m really sorry that our
posters were deemed to be offen-
sive. I think the issue has been
blown way out of proportion. I’m
not saying that minority rights are
not important because they are,
especially at Davidson. But for the
focus to swing to something that
was originally intended as a joke is
wrong.”

Spears said, “Davidson has a
multitude of more pressing prob-
lems than posters. I think that it’s a
shame that many issues or predica;
ments are considered primary just
because it is considered fashion-
able to attack them at the time.”

Senior Andrew Schrader, de-
signer of the fliers, commented on
the controversy surrounding his
creations. He said, “I’m a little bit
surprised [atthe negative reactions
to the posters]. Anyone who saw
bad connotations had to be reading
into them. They’re the one’s with
the problem. They’re creating a
problem that isn’t there, all the

Schrader said that he intended
“no sexual connotations whatso-
ever,” and that “no offense should
be taken if none is intended.”
Before posting the fliers he showed
them to several people including
“10 to 15 women” who Ain turn
“considered them funny,” he said.

Not all members of SAE sup-
port the flyers. Will Caldwell said,
“A large number of SAE’s felt the
posters were in bad taste. Although
I feel that many people overre-
acted to the posters, we still should
be moreconscious of other people’s
opinions.”

Other reactions by Davidson
students were more intense. Jen-
nifer Williams said, “These fliers
are not reflective at all of the fe-
male student body at Davidson,
and SAE, by portraying women in
general as such, is portraying
women on this campus in the same
light.”

Annie Kirkland said, “The
scariest part of this whole incident
is that men are now offended that

dar.

Ortega delivered an emotional
speech, appealing to the strong
sense of nationalism of Nicara-
guans, and blaming United States-
policy for the economic chaos in
the country. The rally ended with
Ortega pitching baseballs to mem-
bers of the most popular Nicara-
guan baseball team who hit the
balls to the crowd. For the finale,
Jimmy Cliff flew: over from’ Ja-
maica to play a mini-concert for
the crowd.

While Ortega popularized all
these fierce symbols for his cam-
paign, President Bush was making
public gestures for peace. Wells
believes Bush’s gestures forced
Ortega try to soften up his image.
In the last days of his campaign,
Ortega emphasized consensus
building and held photo opportu-
nities with babies and dolls.

Meanwhile, now-president
Chamarro joined forces with 14
other political parties and formed
the Uno party. Wells attended
Chamarro’s last campaign rally,

. where she did as much symbol-
manipulating as Ortega did.
Dressed in a white dress and riding
in an elegant white wagon, Cha-

ery to the nation.

Wells and other international
observers of the election in Nica-
ragua guessed Ortega and the
Sandinistas would win the contest.
The crowd at Chamarro’s rally
measured only one fifth the size of
Ortega’s festival-like finale. The
intense Nicaraguan nationalism
combined with their distaste for
recent contra disruptions would,
they thought, sway more votes in
Ortega’s favor.

They were surprised. How did
ithappen? Wells’ believes that the
economic situation in Nicaragua
simply was too awful for the people
to ignore. They felt that they had
sacrificed enough--that their dig-
nity had been taken away from
them--and Ortega was not able to
use Nicaraguan. nationalism to
cloud that issue.

Now thatChamarro isin power,
United States policy has begun to
look much like it was before the
Sandinistas came to power. Ac-
cording to Wells, Washington
would like to convert Nicaragua

into adebtor and make it attractive ©

for United States trade. The United
States stands to benefit from the
aid plan that the Bush administra-

Wells believes will be used more
for political purposes than helpful
development. In addition, the
United States will import agricul-
tural and other products from Nica-
ragua. Wells sees in these and other
developments a return to a more
imperialistic United States policy.
