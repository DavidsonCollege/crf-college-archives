The student Senate, in an
unprecedented move, has re-
cently voted to allot funds
to help finance fraternity
parties for houses under the
new social system.

The allocation came as a
result of several develop-
ments concerning the new
program. .SGA_ President
Ran Coble said, ‘‘We have
been working on ironing out
the problems and complaints
of the new social system."

A group composed of Co-
ble and .senators Gary Cash,
Bob /Meadows, and Bill Ral-
ston studied the implementa-
tion of the system along
with Dean of Students Will
Terry.

The first. action of this
committee, taken at the sug-
gestion of the hall coun-
selors, was to create orienta-
tion groups for assignment
to an eating club instead of
sending the freshmen down
individually.

The fraternities in the
program responded favora-
bly to this change, but it
was pointed out that the pro-

White, director —of admis-

for the quality of this fall’s
freshman class.

“IT am somewhat appre-
hensive at this point,’’, White
said, ‘‘and I think that I
would be unrealistic if I
did not have that, feeling.
My concern is that the class
we enroll may not have the
same strength as in the
past.”’

White indicated that the

Camera

By WINDY MARCH
Staff Writer

For the first time, David-
son College owns a movie
camera for general student
use. George Allen described
the new super-8 Bolex as

the “‘best eight-millimeter
camera available.’’ Allen
Lewis is in charge of the
camera, and for two dollars
a week, any student can
use it.

The camera was bought by
the school ,at the instigation
of Allen, Dick Hinson, and
Steve Engstrom. All are
seniors, who have an interest
in film-making.

The three have written and
begun shooting a film, in

men . together with the old
house members was not

’ Spokesmen: for the frater-
nities suggested the possibi-
lity of an initial social gath-
ering in their. respective
houses between freshmen
and regular members. to fa-
miliarize the newcomers
with what was offered in
a house.

To finance this social func-
tion each of the eight
houses applied for $30, ac-
cording to Coble, and these
requests ($240) were ap-
proved unanimously after
short discussion: at a meet-
ing last week.

Coble said, ‘“‘This is part
of the Senate’s committment
to the new social system
since much of what we pro-
posed was accepted by the
Committee of Eighteen.”

Coble added that the speci-
fic use of the money would
be deft: up to the individual
houses. He stated that the
requests were granted only
for ‘‘an initial social gather-
ing “between the freshmen
and the members of the
houses.”’

Coble admitted that the
grant was unique in two re-
spects, that money had
never before been given for
a social function of this type
and that SGA funds had
never directly or indirectly

cumentary, concerning the
life ‘of an individual at Da-

rell, a student at Queens,
will play a role in the film.

Work on this film is mo-
mentarily halted; Engstrom
is away from Davidson this
quarter, and the three have
run out of money — they
were operating on an acti-
vities grant of fifty dollars.
But all three are enthusias-

tic about the growth of fa-

cilities for student film-mak-
ers at Davidson.

The camera is presently
being used by Bobby Allen,
a junior who is studying at
Hollins under the exchange
program.

was “‘unintentionally- exclu- .

Coble explained that this
applied to many cases’ in
which money was given to
individuals to attend confer-
ences, but that he ‘‘just
doesn't get many group so-
‘cial requests.’’

Lyman Parrigin, spokes-
man for the _ fraternities
which rejected the new so-
cial program, commented on
the fund: ‘‘It is inconceiva-
ble to me that the Senate
could so openly practice’ dis-
crimination with student
funds. This proposal should
be objectionable both to
fraternity, men and indepen-
dents.”’

Coble stated that other
houses on the court could
make similar requests for
party money, but last night ~
the Senate defeated such a
proposal by a vote of 8-6,
