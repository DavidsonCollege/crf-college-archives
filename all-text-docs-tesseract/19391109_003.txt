of the week: What improvement

would you suggest to be made next

Bill Lemmon, Junior: ;

The next great improvement the
college could make in line with their
centennial program is to construét
a new gym. At present, Davidson
has the poorest gym in all respects
of any’ college in or below its size
or class. The need for a gym here
is felt by every student, by most
of the faculty and alumni and by

all of the visiting teams that use
the present “match box” termed
some twenty-five years ago The

New Gym. If the school possessed
a basketball court of standard size
it would undoubtedly improve the
the basketball which put
under much more strain when it
plays on the average court, which
is much larger. The gym is not
available to the students for play-
ing basketball because. the varsity
uses it in the afternoons and the
freshmen at night during the sea-
son, Even when the students,. not
competing for the varsity team, can
get the gym floor it is not large
