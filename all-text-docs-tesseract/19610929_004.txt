SAME OLD PROBLEM

‘THE DEPTH PLAGUE has struck the Davidson
football team once again.

Before the Catawba game, Coach Bill Dole stated
that he had more depth this year than ever before. This
was a true statement no doubt, but that still wasn’t
saying a whole lot. In the past, Davidson players have
pretty much had to be “60-minute men.”

What Dole meant by the current squad’s depth was
that he had two teams. an offensive unit and a defensive
unit, which he could play interchangeably, and not feel
insecure with either on the field.

However, a look at our conference brethren’s rosters
indicates that we don’t really have the depth so necessary
in today’s brand of college football.

Last Saturday's game with Furman is a good example
of what we're talking about. For those of you who went to
Greenville, you'll recall that the weather wasn’t exactly
conducive for a football game. It got kind of warm in the
stands, and you can bet your last buck it was a lot warmer
inside a football uniform.

The first half was nip and tuck, and Furman led at
halftime, 14-13. Throughout that first half, Dole wisely
substituted his two units, and Coach Bob King of Furman

ran his three teams in and out. SY JouN CAUSSY

By the fourth quarter, it was obvious which team Davidsonian Sports Writer
was beat, and you didn’t have to look at the scoreboard
for the answer. Actually, the point spread made no dif-

ference, because we had played an excellent game. We
were simply beat physically and mentally.

The Davidson cross-country team opened its 1961
season at Pembroke College this afternoon. Coach Heath
Whittle was very optimistic last Tuesday as he named the
six men who will make the trip to Pembroke.

“Unless things have changed 16-46. Led by Sterling Martin,
a lot since last year,” Whittle the Wildcats harriers swept the

win,”

Naturally, the extreme heat had an adverse effect on
our players. Many of them sweated off as many pounds
in twenty minutes as they would have in five hours in a
Turkish bath house.

But the fact remains that it was just as hot for the
Furman players. We believe that those extra few minutes
of rest (on the shady side of the stadium incidentally)
provided by an extra unit of players turned the tide for
Furman.

Tomorrow night against The Citadel, Dole will have
only two quarterbacks available since sophomore star
Benny Coxton pinched a nerve in his shoulder last week.
Two more pinched nerves or two sprained ankles or two
broken arms or two anythings and Davidson would be
minus the most important player on the field.

Who knows? Maybe a 220-pound guard could call}
signals pretty well. It’s those roll-out plays we're con-!
cerned about!

ALL-AMERICAN DAD

WHAT'S IT LIKE to have an All-American football
player for a father? Ask George McEver, sophomore
Wildcat end, and you wiay find the answer.

It seems that McEver’s dad, Mr. Gene McEver, re-|
ceived that honor in his college playing days at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee.

Mr. McEver played football at UT (currently better
known as a dance) during the Vols’ “Golden Era,” 1927-
31. He ran from the tailback slot of the then popular
single wing offense.

Davidson won last year’s meet year as co-captain with Dave
with Pembroke by a score of Gilmore. Other men running

Game Tomorrow Night

BY MIKE HOLMES

Sports Writer

The third game of Coach Bill Dole’s tenth year as

head man at Davidson College finds his

Wildcats in

Charleston, S. C., tomorrow night against The Citadel
Bulldogs. Kickoff time is 8 p.m.

The Citadel, under the able
tutelage of Eddie Teague, will
be searching for the combina-
tion to unlock their first win.
Downed by Memphis State, 40-0,
in their opener, the Bulldogs
also dropped number two, a
17-13. squeaker last week to
George Washington.

EXCITING SERIES

The Citadel-Davidson series
dates back to 1909. The ’Cats
lead in the series, 18-13-4. Says
Dole, “We have always had a
very fine series with The Cita-
del. Generally the games are
very close.”

The Bulldogs run a T-forma-

| tion, with Bill Whaley, a polish-

ed passer, at the quarterback
slot. The ’Cats must also watch
Earley Eastburn, fastest man on
The Citadel's squad and a con-
stant breakaway threat. The
speedy Bulldog halfback led his
team in scoring and yards rush-
ing a year ago, and was named
to the All-Conference second
team.

Rounding out the backfield
are shifty halfback Tommy Ed-
wards, senior letterman, and
Belton Dykes, 6-1, 190-lb., block-
busting fullback.

Citadel's line is somewhat
larger in poundage this year,
but inexperience prevails in the
interior segment. There ‘are let-
termen end, and Sd Harrington,
220-Ib. stellar guard, has savvy
up front.

DOLE PLEASED

Despite the lop-sided score at
Furman last week (45-19), Dole
was well pleased with his team’s

F uller Paces ‘Cats :
Offense On

Jim Fuller has proved

Chester Davis, and varsity experience with the Davidson Wildcats.

With such speedsters as Bob
Cordle, Alex Gibbs, Joe Jones,
and Dave Lopp playing half-
back on the Wildcat squad this
season, Fuiler wasn’t really
counted on to carry a payload.

Last season on the freshman
team, he had done a good job,
but he just didn’t seem to have
the necessary speed to be a real
good halfback. And he tended
to be a little lazy at times.

But when fall practice began,
the big, blond sophomore from
High Point, N. C., apparently
had turned over a new leaf. In
the pre-season scrimmages and
workouts he turned in some out-
standing performances.

He continued these perform-
ances into the season, and after
two games, he is tied with Ben-

himself after two games of

ny Coxton as the team’s leading
ground gainer with 80 yards in
18 carries. He is our “Wildcat
of the week.”

Fuller makes up for his lack
of speed with his power. His ond
195-Ib. frame enables him to
bulldoze instead of dodge.

On one play against Furman,
a referree stepped in his way as
he, broke through a nice hole in
the Furman line. Fuller fore-
armed the official into a would-
be Paladin tackler, cut for the
sidelines, an@ about 25 yards |
later was hauled down. |

Fuller is an outstanding |
basketball player too. Last year,
he averaged 15 points a game in
the inter-fraternity league, and
was named to the All-Star first
team.

COXTON OUT

Besides losing the game, Dav-
idson lost the services of Benny
Coxton, first team quarterback,
who will be out of action about
a month due to a pinched nerve.

However, Earl Cole, who did
a magnificent job of filling in
for the injured Coxton, steps up
to the number one spot, as the

first offensive unit remains in-
tact.

Bill Bankhead is still a doubt-
ful starter due to an injury in
the Catawba game, but Morris
Williams is set to fill in for him.

The 'Cats have an open date
next weekend, and the addition-
al time will be spent preparing
for the Homecoming battle with
Presbyterian on October 14.

I-F Flickerball

heavy graduation losses from
last year’s undefeated team by
clobbering the Pi Kapps, 52-0.

24-6 triumph over the stubborn
Sigma Nus.
