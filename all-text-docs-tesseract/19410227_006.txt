Guest Columnist—Bob (By Jones)
Johnston.

Colin has hit on the novel idea
that a delegated responsibility serves
two purposes most effectively. The
first: It serves to give men an op-
portunity to do “Y” work; the sec-
ond, and this is the real reason, it
gives him a good excuse to “beat
out,” or “dog” or whatever you call
it where you come from.

Cabinet Meeting.

However, in this case it’s the
reading public who will suffer. I'm
going to run over briefly some of
the business taken up in the last
Cabinet meeting since some of you
may have wondered just what
goes on in such gatherings. To
begin with, one of the more urgent
matters is this thing of prayer
groups. This is the first year since
Ben Hur put on long pants that the
prayer groups have continued to
meet even up to the second semes-
ter. Let’s not grow lax on this
post-exam calm as we are prone to
do, in more ways than one, and al-
Jow our prayer groups to peter out.

If we are to continue as we
should for the remainder of the
semester we must support our group
leaders—reminding them if neces-
sary. This.thing is too important
to let slide.

Freshman Groups.

Another subject discussed was the
possibility of having a “reconven-
ing” of the freshman divisions. You
of the class of '44 (Finley is looking
over my shoulder, applauding vig-
orously) will remember that you
were assigned a professor and a
cabinet member as a councilor dur-
ing the Orientation Period. Al-
thought these groups have  per-
formed their fundamental job, we
feel that it might not be a bad idea
if we could meet together again—

the near future. Of course, many
of these groups will be rather
“moth-eaten,” but that’s just an-

other reason why we should meet

again.
There’s a hundred other things
I'd like to say, but I know Dale

would be merciless with his shears.
Yours,
BOB JOHNSON.

Young People’s Class Discuss-
es True Friendship At Sec-
ond Meeting.

The Young People’s Group
which has been organized for
the colored youth of Davidson
held its second meeting Sun-
day night at 7:30 in the Dave
McLean Community Hut.

First Meeting.

This group which was organized
by Bill McLaughlin held its first
meeting Sunday, Feb. 16, and dis-
cussed,.the subject, Character and
Reputation. The subject for last
Sunday's discussion was True
Friendship.

The idea has met with the enthu-
siastic support of the colored young
people, and last Sunday the discus-
sion lasted for an hour and a half.
Although one hour had been pre-
scribed as the time for these meet-
ings ,only one person left at the end
of this period. Fifteen people were
present at the gathering.

Next Sunday's meeting will mark
the beginning of a study of the
Book of Proverbs. The subject for
discussion will be Benefits Received
From Wisdom.

Open Forum.

McLaughlin the hope
that an open forum might be held
in the near future in which groups
of young people from both the
white and colored schools would be
present. A topic for discussion will
chosen which will present a

problem concerning both races.
The principal of the colored
school favors the plan and has al-
ready chosen his group for the dis-
cussion. Although the principal of
the white school has not been con-
sulted concerning the idea and
plans have not been made for
choosing the group from the white
school, the leaders in the movement
hope that their plans will material-

ize within the next two weeks.

Dr. Caleb Harding made a talk

“Aristophanic Wit and Humor
in Present Day Literature” to the
local chapter of Eta Sigma Phi last
Wednesday night, February 19, at
the Y. M. C. A. reading room.

After several business matters
were discussed, Dr. Harding gave
his talk on the influence of Aristo-
phanes in modern wit and humor.
He gave several puns and ditties as
examples to illustrate his point. His
examples proved to be very funny,
yet they showed the relation be-
tween present day wit and humor
and that of Aristophanes.

cess lasting from two to three years.
Careful steps of planting, growing,
harvesting, curing, ageing, condi-
tioning for correct moisture con-
tent, and blending of the various
domestic tobaccos with imported
Turkish leaf are the groundwork.
Then comes modern  fool-proof
manufacture, making possible pro-
duction of millions of packages of
cigarette per day.

The Chesterfield factories at Dur-
ham, N. C., portrayed in this book,
alone cover one hundred and fifty
acres. Every visitor to “Tobacco-
land" finds a tour through these
factories an adventure in American

never forgets the bright golden color

and rich fragrance of the newly-
opened hogshead of tobacco fresh
from their long mellowing in stor-

Bible’ Professor Finds Four
Lessons In Old Familiar
Passage.

Praises Psalms.

Dr. Schenck started by saying
that a man who introduces persons
that become friends has done a
great service to the men. But a
man who has introduced a book to
a man and that book influences the
life of the man has done an even
greater service. He went on to say
that the Psalms have influenced
the lives of more men than any oth-
er book of the Bible.

Four Lessons.

According to Dr. Schenck, four
lessons can be gotten from. the
Twenty-third Psalm. A person

who believes in God shall have his
needs cared for. Secondly, a per-
son-who~ believes in God shall be
directed toward the ends which God
sets for us. Thirdly, a person who
believes’*in~God~shall--have— more
meaning to life than one who be-
lieves not. Lastly, the person who
believes in God shall be victorious
against sin.

These four points were discussed
to some detail after which Dr
Schenck closed the service with a
word of prayer. Speaker for next
Sunday will be announced in chapel
on Saturday.
