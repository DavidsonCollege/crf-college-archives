In sp-te of several fine indi-
vidual performances, the David-
son swimmers dropped their sec-
ond meet to The Citadel by a
72-32 ‘score, Dec. 10.

Eddie Beach paced the Wild-
cats’ effort with eight points. He
won the 200-yard Individual
Medley Relay and placed sec-
ond in the 220-yard butterfly.

John Helm and Bobby Vagt
helped the Davidson cause, col-
lecting six points each. Helm
took second in the 50 and 100-
yard freestyle events, while
Vagt finished second in the 200
and 500-yard freestyle competi-
tion.

Also outstanding for Davidson
was Joe Friebele, who won the
200-yard backstroke event with
a time of 2:25.7.

In the diving competition,
Tucker Dalton placed second.

Coach Tom Stevens said, “This
is Tucker's first year in diving
competition, and he is progress
ing well.”

Stevens continued, “‘We are
fairly strong in the individual
medleys but we are lacking in

Writer
other events, especially the
sprints. We are missing three
good swimmers from last year's
team, and, for what we have,
we are coming along well.”

Mac Davis and Doug Stott
each won two events, but did
not receive much support as the
freshmen finmen lost to The Cit-
adel, 69-34.

Davis took first in the 100 and
200-yard freestyle competition,
turning in a new record time of
53.1 in the former. Stott fin-
ished first in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley and butterfly com-
petition.

Ed Bartle and Wendell Holmes
also contributed to the Wildcat
effort. Bartle won the 500-yard
freestyle while Holmes placed
second in the 50-yard freestyle
event.

Stevens said, “The team is

John Thacker will give us some |
help next year.”
