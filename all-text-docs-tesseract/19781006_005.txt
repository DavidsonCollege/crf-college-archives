Neyon: Is. the authoritarian nersonality really dead?

To the Editor:

I tried to submit this votea
last May, but I was unable, at
that time, to get it typed. I did
show it to half'a dozen faculty
members at that time in order
to get their sense of the piece.
Their reactions were entirely
favorable. In the event that
there are formal responses to it
at a later date, I will be pleased
to clarify my argument.

_ _Inrecent years there has been
a surge of interest on American
campuses in holocaust studies.
This is occurring some thirty

years after the Nazi atrocities..

Future historians looking back
at our times may wonder, not at
the parallels between Worid
War II and the Vietnam War,
but, rather, at our inability to
see these parallels.

It may appear then, as to
some it does already, that our
current concern with the holo-
caust is as close as we dare come
to examining our own manifest
capacity for committing atroci-
ties.
~ Phere are other signs, too, of
a repressive mechanism being
at work in our ethos. As if
intuitively aware that the
source of our guilt lies beyond
our national boundaries, the
seventies have witnessed a new
isolationism in both politics and
academics, And even within our

_ domestic scene the political and
social awareness of the sixties
has given way to asocial and,
more worrisome yet, irrational
movements.

Soul searching

There is a-good deal of -

searching for personal, simplis-
tic, and dependent belief sys-
tems. Some turn to new reli-
gions like the Moonies and
many to the plethora of pseudo-
psychological therapies where
they take refuge in a particular
brand of psychobabble (R.D.
Rosen, (Psychobabble). All of
them seem to have in common
the belief that with the strip-

ping away of errant and super- .

fluous attitudes -- as promised

movements and the pseudo-
psychological fads, we could
say that any bliss attained is
born of ignorance rather than
innoncence and willful igno-
rance at that.

All these pressures against
the intellect are worrisome be-
cause it so often seems that in
our society reason plays the role
of critic rather than guide, and

“fascism, far from being dead, is.

constrainted more by temporary
historical circumstances than it
is by our moral, intellectual,

- “Quaint” fascism

In our complacency we have
allowed the term “facsist’’ to
become almost quaint, and yet,
during the hour in which we ate
‘dinner last night, the following
happened in South Africa. Six
black families were evicted from
their homes. Sixty arrests were
made under Past Laws. Sixty
black children died of mainutri-
tion. And the gold mining com-
panies made US $65,000 in pro-
fits.

Before we disassociate our-
selves from this criminal regime
let us remember that foreign
companies control 80% of pro-
duction there. These same fo-
reign companies typically pay
black wages below the poverty
datum line and typically realize
per worker profits higher than
they can in their European and
North American plants. Our
universities and colleges have
investments in a number of
U.S. corporations which have
operations in South Africa. The
returns on these investments
help to pay salaries and to keep
tuition costs down; hence, the
connection between fascism and
the dinner that we ate last
night.

There is nothing quaint about
fascism, it remains our greatest
danger.

- Can't say no

How well prepared are we to
withstand fascism in our own
society? Perhaps the prior ques-
tion is how well prepared are we
to face it in our own lives and
our own behavior. In a classic

Behind this belief in a pure
inner self lies, I suspect, « hope
that the inner’ self is not only
pure but innocent. This quest to
achieve a blamelezs state, un-
critical and uncsiticized, sug-
gests a motive rather less pure

to be not only very painful but
dangerous. They delivered,
these shocks -- to thought they
did -- because a researcher in a
white coat who said he was a
scientist told them to. Their
participation was voluntary.
There have been numerous
verifications of this result. Our
ability to say no to authority is
almost. negligible. Our educa-

tion system makes obedience a
virtue sine qua non. Through-
out, our society, obedience in the
guise of organizational loyalty
takes precedence over almost all

other moral principles. And yet,

without the capacity for disobe-
dience, without the ability to
defy authority in the name of
morality, there can be no moral-
ity. We must be ‘individuals
first and subjects afterward
(Thoreau).

giste have carried out extensive
investigations into the nature of
the authoritarian personality.
The desire that the fascist has
for simple, total, and final
solutions to the problem of
order in society stems not from
the problem itself, but from the
fascist’s underlying fear of the
world as a wild and dangerous
place. They tend to see the
world in terms of the pure in
group and the contaminating
out groups; hence, the typical
association found between fas-
cism and prejudice.
Obsession with authority

The defining characteristic. of
a fascist, however, is an obses-
sion with authority which be-
comes expressed in terms of
submissiveness to superiors
and tyranny towards inferiors.
The leader's submission is, of
course, to a vision rather than
to a person. In fascist social or-
ganizations the demand for
obedience becomes paramount.

“The strength of a political
party lies by no means in a
mentality as great and as
independent as possible of the

individual members, but rather
in the disciplined obedience
with which its members follow
their intellectual leadership.”
(Hitler, Mein Kampf)

Naturally, as an organization
becomes increasingly fascist,
rules proliferate, discipline in-
creases, perquisites diminish,
and genuine decision making
power and information control.

‘tion. Democratic forms of parti-
cipation wane before the emer-

‘ever more clearly into focus.
Legitimation ideology

‘With the emergence of the
new. power formation comes a
change Tif the legitimating
logy.. In fascism there are two
‘main methods of legitimating
authority. One is to find scape-
goats and given the psychologi-. .
cal dispositions of fascists this
is usually an easy task with
ethnicity, religion, and dissent
providing favorite criteria.

The other method of legitima-
tion is through appeal to a

supra ordinate goal such as the
good of the people. Since the
people have no power, such an
J appeal serves only to justify the

subjectivity of the leadership.
“Idealism...is...the prerequi-
site for what we call human
culture...To this inner attitude
the Aryan owes his position in
the world...true idealism is
nothing but subjecting the iridi-
vidual’s interests and life to the

Letter to the Editor ;
Vending machines
dont need ‘help’

To the Editor:

The number of refunds paid
out for malfunctions of the
vending machines has been
exceedingly high this year:

We are advised by the com-
pany routemen that a number of.
the stoppages have been caused
by foreign items in the coin
slots. “Tabs” from drink cans

appear to be a favorite substi-
tute for a coin. It must be ob-
vious that they will not operate
the machine, so it must appear
“funny” to the person putting
them in.

It’s not nearly as funny to the
student who may be putting his
last coin in during the wee hours
when he needs a study break.
Or to the numerous persons who
may try to use the machine
before it is cleared several days
later.

Unlike human beings, the
machines are not perfect and.
have enough of their own mal-
functions without our compoun-
ding them. Pleas@ consider -
others.
