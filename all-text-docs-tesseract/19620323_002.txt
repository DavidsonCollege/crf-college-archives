THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Arbitrary Dismissal | |

In its suggestion to the faculty,
the Honor Court has pointed out the
central dilemma in the arbitrary dis-
missal rule for honor offenses—the
problem of meting out punishment for
offenses in proportion to their ser-
iousness.

The court has recommended that,
in effect, the minimum punishment
for any of the multitudes and degrees,
large or small, of sins and near-sins
which fall under the “honor” classifi-
cation should be reduced to automatic
suspension from the college with the
possibility of return in one year,
should the admissions committee
agree. We regret that the court’s re-
quest to the faculty does not deal with
the problem more adequately.

The time for an honest and just
appraisal of the arbitrary dismissal
rule is long overdue. In stressing the
need for “some significant degree of
punishment,” the court points out the
fact it must surely have learned from
judiciary experience—a court can not

_ function as a fair court if every mis-
demeanor as well as every felony is
punishable only by death.

Under such a system, a court can
seldom be both honest and fair. If it
is honest, it calls any degree of steal-
ing, cheating, or lying an honor of-
fense and thereby condemns the of-
fender to a punishment far out of
proportion to the offense. The result
is not only a grave personal injustice
to the defendant but a weakening of
the judiciary, as well.

It is not necessary to labor the
point further; its validity and its
ramifications are clear to everyone
and freely admitted by even the de-
fenders of the system.

Yet let anyone suggest that we
find a more useful, just, and humane

substitute for the arbitrary dismissal
rule, and the most pious Christian,
even the most ardent S.P.C.A. mem-
ber, raises a cry of protest: “Scrap the
Rule and you'll scrap the System! The
Rule makes the System work! !”

This just is not so. If there is a
concept of honor among Davidson
students, it is a deep-rooted acquisi-
tion from our heritage and social
training, not something we read about
in the Student Regulations and adopt-
ed about the same time we put on our
beanies, registered for freshman class-
es, and bought our first beer at Hat-
tie’s. If personal honor exists and if
its practice is enforced, it is enforced
by personal habit, mutual agreement
with the other members of Davidson
society, and the force of the moral
condemnation of that society.

The Honor Court and the student
body regulations are a very proper
part of that social condemnation, but
they do not constitute the major part.
They are, rather, the official expres-
sion of the large body of social opin-
ion. When justice is so arbitrary that
it does not reflect this opinion justly
its effectiveness is considerably re-
duced. Criminologists have shown,
moreover, that extreme, harsh and
arbitrary punishments do not dis-
courage crime but, by their very un-
reasonableness, encourage wanton
and irresponsible disobediance, Law
and Justice having lost their meaning
and context.

The faculty will do a positive
service to both the Davidson Honor
System and many individuals whose
lives may be unjustly marred if they
meet the problem the Honor Court
presents practically and justly by
eliminating the arbitrary dismissa
rule. L.K

Elections: A Wrap-Up

Elections for 1962 are over. The
student body has chosen approximate-
ly 27 officers and representatives for
five or six separate organizations.
With the exception of the student
body president race and one day of
student council voting, turnout was
light. The flurry of interest in THE
DAVIDSONIAN editorship died down
by election day.

Now is the time to suggest im-
provements in elections procedures,
which have been only slightly changed
in several years. Since elections rules
were removed from the student body
constitution last year, laxity and
vagueness have crept into Elections
Board practices. There was no system-
atic overhaul of procedure, as might
have been anticipated last year. An
elections board, meeting for the first
time about a week before elections,
cannot be expected’to come up with
answers to all problems: should the
ballot boxes remain locked until 1
p.m.? (We feel they certainly should
be.) How best to keep track of who
has voted? (The list should be checked
off by a member of the elections
board.) Where should the polls be lo-
cated? (Many feel that polls in front
of the dorms or even in the P. O.
would draw more voters.)

See No Evil?

Will it be shown at Davidson or
not? That has been the question this
week about attempts to bring the
Spanish film “Viridiana” to campus in
us first U.S. showing outside New

ork.

But more important than scoring
a premier is the matter of whether
the film will be allowed at all. Present-
ly, the word is no; this is highly re-
grettable.

The campus film program has.
moved forward tremendously this
year, enabling the community to see
excellent foreign and domestic films
of an artistic as well as thought pro-
voking nature. “Viridiana,” from all
we can read, is another film of this
calibre and we have an opportunity
to show it here probably months be-
fore it would otherwise be available
in this area.

Both the film committee and the
persons presently vetoing the film
express a sincere interest in showing
it here. But they have been working

But the greatest problem is the
lack of campaigning, which keeps
many students in the dark as to who
is running for what. Qualification and
interest in officer-holding take second
place to popularity, since many stud-
ents do not know who the candidates
are. We don’t favor formal tactics
or the expenditure of money, but so-
liciting of votes should be allowed
and opinions on issues should be ex-
plained.

Most students deplore the ten-
dency toward bloc voting by fraterni-
ties. We know that it is easier for a
man to vote for his fraternity brother
when he does not even know the other
candidates. If a ballot could be posted
the day before the voting begins, and
candidates could at least make their
positions known, more interest in
other nominees might be generated.
The no-campaign tradition worked
fine when 600 students knew each
other fairly well. Now that close to
1000 students are eligible to vote the
problem of knowing the candidates

ecomes more difficult.

We would like to see a committee
appointed to draw up a complete set
of elections procedures. The time to
decide is now.

DBS.

at cross purposes, The snag is a re-
luctance to show the film, because of
its controversial nature, unless the
manner of presentation renders it an
“educational” experience. A panel is
desired to discuss the movie and its
implications.

We find no fault with that, but
we do wonder if this should be a pre-
requisite for showing a film. Certainly
all viewers should not be required to
attend such a discussion. Why must we
justify bringing a widely acclaimed
film to campus, just because it sets
forth ideas we don’t fully embrace?

Only hard feelings and misunder-
Standings are being bred by the pres-
ent conflict. Both sides should get to-
gether; they both want the film—so
do we. Let's order it. Then, since in-
telligent debate should always be
welcome, let the movie stir ideas and
invite outsiders to participate in the
voluntary discussion.

But let’s not be afraid to show a
controversial movie or try to keep it
from being shown.

Music Professor Hits
Salient Dissonant Note

BY WALTER McDONALD
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Underachievement was given
anew meaning in Tuesday’s
chapel period. Professor Robert
S. Lord of the Music Depart-
ment expressed his ideas con-
cerning the liberal education
offered in “the best men’s
school” in the South.

REVISION NEEDED

First and foremost, there is
a need for a drastic revision of
the curriculum. Davidson is not
generally known outside the
South and its liberal arts curri-
culum is weak compared to
schools whose standards it
would like to emulate. Dr. Lord
maintained that the purpose of
the core requirements is to

insure that students be expos-

ed to a wide yariety of courses,

before specializing in any par-
ticular field. He further stated
that required subjects should,
in nearly all cases, be one se-
mester courses with the pur-
pose of stimulating the student
by opening new fields of under-
standing to him.

One semester courses would
give the student a better chance
to work in such areas as eco-
nomics, fine arts, music philo-
sophy, political science, psycho-
logy, and sociology; areas to
which many Davidson students
are never exposed because there
are too many two semester
courses. If Davidson is to suc-
ceed in “preparing its graduates
not simply for making a living,

but for living more abundantly,”
then changes must be introduc-
ed.

VISITING COMMITTEE

A committee of twelve to six-
teen visiting scholars represent-
ing all the fields of liberal arts
should be invited to visit Dav-
idson, to analyze its problems,
and then present a written re-
port stating specific methods for
their improvements. Such a re-
port should be made available
for all to study.

The initial step has been
taken and positively received by
the student body; now it is up
to the administration and facul-
ty to continue this movement
that will bring Davidson nearer
to “the best college of its kind
in the nation.”

One-Act Plays Effectively
Diverted With Diversity

BY GREG GOVAN

Davidsonian Staff Writer
Subjectivism reigned last
Wednesday night at Hodson Hall
as the Vagabonds presented an
“evening of diverse dramn.”
Ranging from the avant-garde
of Beckett to the rather prosaic
Rupert Brooke, the four one-act

plays were without exception
well staged and excellently per-
formed.

Rather than being so di-
verse as the program might
indicate, the evening was
rather heavily salted with the
modern tragic, and there was
not a true comedy in the lot.

Legislative Delegation
Was Minority Voice

BY AL EDGAR
Delegate To SSL
‘A few weekends ago, while
Josh White was somewhere up
in West Virginia, seven David-
sonians (Bob Cordle, Butch Zim-
merman, Tony Diaz, Larry Leaf-
er, Chester Davis, and Al Edgar)
travelled to Raleigh for an an-
nual event known as the State
Student Legislature of North
Carolina. All the members of
this legislature, which meets in
the State Capitol building, are
students from various colleges
throughout the state.
EXPERIENCE VALUABLE

The idea is to simulate as
much as possible the actual
workings of a real grown-up
legislature. Each school submits
a bill which is debated and vot-
ed upon by both the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
Any differences in the bills as
they are passed by each house
are ironed out by a conference
committee at the end of the
legislature. The final results in
the way of legislation are mean-
ingless. There is some value,
however, in the debating and
political maneuvering exper-
ience gained in producing these
results.

Most of the bills introduced
were of national and interna-
tional significance. One bill
would have applied a minimum
wage to migratory agricultural
workers. Another would have
prevented federal funds from
being used for fall out shelters.
A third would establish a super
N.A.T.O. and require that the
U.S. enter the Common Market.
There was also the standard
plea for the abolition of capital
punishment.

As might be expected, most
of the colored schools concen.
trated on civil rights-type legis-
lation. Among the most interest-
ing of these was a proposal that

would relieve private institu-
tions (such as Davidson) of
their state tax exemption unless
integration were carried out
forthwith.

In general the Davidson dele-
gation was a small but vocal
minority in opposition to most
of the measures proposed. This
was done not so much because
of any particular ideological
views held by the delegation,
but just for the sake of creat-
ing a little argument. It seemed
for awhile that the “august”
body was just going to solemnly
ratify all that stuff.

WORK LAW PASSED

When it came time to present
our own bill. which would ‘estab-
lish the right to work on a na-
tional scale, we naturally did
not expect the utmost sympathy.
All the more so, since enlight-
ened young college students are
supposed to know better than
to have such horrible, reaction-
ary ideas as not requiring a
worker to join a labor union be-
fore he takes a job.

However, this came at the
end of a session and everyone
was tired out. It passed. The
next day the legislature tried to
repeal it, but to no avail.

The State Student Legislature
is definitely a worthwhile ex-
perience for all those who either
aspire to being a legislator, or
want to know how we get some

But the somewhat less than a
hundred persons who saw the
plays got much more than
50c worth of entertainment.

Atrabal’s Picnic on the Battle-
field was the first presentation.
The cast, except for Mrs. Lucy
Johnston, wag practically inex-
perienced, and yet managed to
hold the play together well.

Lithuania by Rupert Brooke
was a dripping melodrama of
crippled fratricide. The talent
of its actors far outstripped the
calibre. of the play.

Edna St. Vincent Milley’s
Aria da Capo was a gem;
clear, concise, and highly
polished. The story of tragedy
within a farce, it was beauti-
fully done with splendid per.
formances by all five sectors.

Although Aria raised the
number of deaths on stage and
off to seven with its double
murder, there was not a feeling
of “too much.” It was evident
that the audience was captured
by the simple and pathetic de-
mise of the shepherds, presided
over by the heavy-handed mas-
que of tragedy. And the fault-
less farce of Pierrot and Colum-
bine added the precise touch
of emphasis.

But if Aria was the evening’s
gem, Samuel Beckett's Krapp’s
Last Tape was its masterpiece.
Smith McKeithen did a brilliant
job in the difficult monologue,
somehow managing to take the
audience through the gamut of
emotions.

The old figure of Krapp,
although he provoked on oc-
casion the same uncomfort-
able laugh, erased the stage
barrier. The audience taugh-
ed and then asked themselves
why, and so were drawn up
to participation in the action.
One had the uneasy feeling
of having his own self in the
spotlight for scrutiny, and the
personality of Krapp was
merely the catalyst.

A fine evening, with few if
any exceptions, capped by an
intriguing and involving per-

Sense Of Hope For Peace

BY DR. MAX E. POLLEY
Bible Department

. . Bennett, Dean of the Faculty at Union
Thecagical Semin : in New York, has rendered a real
service to the American people in his book Christianity
and Communism Today.

time when our attention is being attracted to the
extremists upon both the left and the right it is illuminat-
ing to read a sober and realistic app of the major
issue which divides our world. This is not a difficult book
to read. It is well outlined and clearly expressed. But on
the other hand, it must be read with great care to do
justice to Dr. Bennett's analysis of Christianity and Com-
munism. He refuses to yield to the temptation of over-
simplification in order to stimulate.

There is more light than there is fire in this book.
The merits and defects of both Christianity and Com-
munism are honestly discussed. Bennett refuses to
equate Christianity with Capitelism or Democracy
or America; but he does acknowledge that Chris-
tianity has flourished in such an environment. He
even points out specific advanta found in Capi-
talism which are in harmony with Christian princi-

ples.

He honestly discusses the virtues of the Communist
ideology; but he also attacks the barbarous means by
which this is to be accomplished. Slave labor camps, ter-
rorist tactics, and the dictatorship of the proletariat are
all indications of the failure of Communism to treat
human beings with dignity.

There is a real sense of hope in this book. Dr. Ben-
nett sees changes within the Soviet Union that are en-
couraging. He calls us to open lines of communication
with Russia that will move the world toward peaceful
co-existence. He maintains anything short of this would
be suicidal. But there is also a challenge hurled at the
Christian reader. Is the Communist attack upon Christian-
ity really unjustified? Has not the Christian church failed
to live up to its ideals of ministering to the needs of all
men? Has it not too often become a supporter of the
status quo and identified its message with that of the
ideals of the upper class?

There is too much truth in this criticism to re-
gard it as merely Communist propaganda. Granted
that there is a radical difference between these two
rival systems, especially concerning their analysis of
human nature, is it not also true that we share the
one ideal of concern for the betterment of the mater-
ial conditions of men? Dr. Bennett calls Christianity
to meet the challenge of Communism, to sever it-
self from unholy alliances with the privileged groups,
and to meet the needs of those who are struggling
for social justice.

This is truly a splendid book. It is calculated to dis- |
turb the reader. But it will also enlighten him that he
might be better. able to understand conflicting points of
view on this subject. We have had Mr. Fulton Lewis IH,
Representatives Rivers and Judd, and Secretary of State
Dean Rusk on the campus this year. That these speakers
presented different approaches to the Communist threat
should have been obvious to everyone. If it was not, a
reading of Dr. Bennett’s book will help clarify the issues.

National Spirit Unites
S. American Youth

BY TONY DIAZ

Historically, as in Spain, the
Latin American student is sur-
rounded with a kind of romantic
halo. His role has been audac-
ious and idealistic. He is always
challenging tyranny and auto-
cracy, championing the ideals of
liberty, democracy and social
justice. In recent. Latin Ameri-
can history, the students have
been in the vanguard of active
groups working to undermine
dictators. For this, the com-
munity responds to the students
with gratitude, even affection.

INFLUENCE ACADEMICS

As in Spanish Universities
from which Latin American
Universities are descended, the
students have a ballot and are
an important voice in making
decisions affecting University
policy. Student leaders help de-
termine the University stand on
public policy.

Today, students feel an obliga-

-tion to participate actively in

the national life of their coun-
try, aware that the next five
years will determine the kind
of nation in which they will live.
But students show little sense
of having any vested interest in
the rapidly changing society of
which they are a part. The re-
sult is a flamboyant, passionate,
partially informed student body
eager to assert itself in the na-
tional life.
POLITICAL SPECTRUM

Politically, the students range
from hard-line international
Communists to those favoring
military dictatorship. There are
nationalistic Marxists and what
we might term leftist, democra-
tic socialists. There are intellec.
tual democrats who would favor
a strongly centralized and guid-
ed democracy, with a mixed
economic system of public and
private enterprise. A very dom-
inant and loud voice in the La-

ever, it is the Christian Demo-
cratic party (in Panama) or that
which would favor liberal Catho-
lic social thought, it being the
one which dominates the scene.

A great deal of variety ap-
pears among the students when
it comes to their operation to
society. This is so because many
come from economically middle
class families which yet have to
develop any common attitude
toward society. The strongest
unifying factor among students
may be summed up by the slo-
gan ‘My Country First.”

Nationalism, a belief in the
primacy of one’s country per-
meates the student's thinking
on all political, social and eco-
nomic issues. In the twentieth
century Latin American stud-
ents feel constricted by the
economic realities of countries,
primarily producers of raw ma-
terials in a world that is highly
industrialized.

WANT CHANGE

The students are torn by their
political tradition of the strong-
man tyrant coupled with an un-
focused intellectual bent toward
democracy, and they are held
down by the fairly closed, hier-
archical social structure of their
recent colonial past. They see
the need for concerted action
and immediate change.

Summing up, the University
in Latin America is not only a
medium through which our
young people receive their pro-
fessional training and educa-
tion, but also through which
they study questions related to
their interests and necessities
of the nation. It is for this
reason that an American stud-
ent, in my opinion will find the
University the optimal place
in which to study a Latin Ameri-
can country. There, he can con-
tact all levels of society and
reach all businesses and profes-

of our messed up laws. formance.
