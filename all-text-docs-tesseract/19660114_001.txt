Registrar Squelches
Draft Scare Rumors

There is no immediate need
for concern over the draft scare
circulating among Davidson stu-
dents lately, Registrar F. W.
Hengeveld told THE DAVID-
SONIAN this week.

Hengeveld stated that all the
rumors are speculation and that
there have been no changes in
the draft laws as yet.

The interest in the draft has
been stimulated by articles in
newspapers and magazines sug-
gesting that students may be
drafted out of college in the near
future.

In the Jan. 10 issue of U.S.
News and World Report head of
the draft system Gen. Lewis B.
Hershey tells of a shortage in
men available to fill the draft
quota. He says that many men
now listed as 1Y who failed the
physical, those who are tech-
nically in the reserves but ‘‘are
not doing anything’’ and men be-
tween the age of 19 and 26 and
not in school are liable to the

To Return

Comedian Fred Smoot, her-
alded as a ‘“‘refreshingly bright
one-man comic show,” will re-
turn to the Davidson campus
for a week-long stand at the
College Union during the first
week of February.

A specially-created ‘‘night-
club motif'’ will be the setting
for Smoot as he does two dif-
ferent comedy routines per
night on the nights of February
2-3-4-5 in the Union's Morrison
room.

Sterling Martin, assistant di-
rector of the Union, told THE
DAVIDSONIAN that this type of
program is a new experiment
by the Union, and that advance
indications have foretold great
interest on the part of the col-
lege community.

Food will be served during the
performances, each about 45
minutes long, and there will be
a one dollar cover charge per
person for the performances.

Smoot, who has received the
applause of critics from coast to

coast, is the \eteran of two
previous appearances at David-
son, having aphfeared during
Spring Frolics each of the past
two years.

Using vocal gimivks, sounds,

diences with renditions of Paul

morning shave and others.

Vespers Sermon

The Vespers service this Sum

Rev. Will H. Terry, college
chaplain.

As of Wednesday, Rev. Terry

This service will be the last

draft.

Of main concern to Davidson
students is Hershey's idea of
having each college submit a
list of the lower quarter of each
class to the draft boards if the

‘draft quota is not met. ‘Defer-

ment,” he says, ‘‘is a privilege:"
the normal status of a man the
proper age is 1A. Hershey gave
this advice to the student:
“Study. If you want to stay a
student, be one.”

Hengeveld reiterated, how-
ever, that since no laws have
been changed, there is no ime
mediate need for concern, The
Selective Service does not now
require any information about
grades or class status. Students
are deferred annually, from Oct.
15 to Oct. 15, if they stay in
school.

LACK OF CONTACT CITED

Rush Complaints Aired

By MASON STEPHENSON

Davidsonian Staff Writer

The lack of contact between
freshmen and upper-classmen
was the major complaint this
past week of fraternity presi-
dents and faculty members con-
cerning the rush regulations
which were used this first se-
mester.

The change in rush regulations

4this fall was brought about by

the re-evaluation of the frater-
nity system last spring. The
rules oh contact between the up-
per- and lower-classmen were
very strict in the delayed rush
change.

Instead of the rush period be-
ing limited to the first week of
school, rush did not begin until
Saturday, Oct. 30. and was
stretched out over a period of
two ‘months.

McGAVOCK
Dr. W. G. McGavock, profes-

sor of mathematics, said that
the program had answered a
good many questions as to the
acedemic performance of the
Students, the lack of an emo-
tional buildup to rush and pledg-
ing and the de-emphasis of fra-
ternities.

“No one expected the program
to be a complete success, but it
has answered some questions,”
he stated. ‘‘I believe the sys-
tem instead of being wrong has
been effective enough so that the
committee (Committee on Eval-
uation of Social Life) can take
it and move on to another stage
in solving the problems."

Commenting on the academic
performance of students, Mc-
Gavock continued. ‘Mainly
there has been a smoother aca-
demic procedure than we have
ever had before.’" But he sees
some disadvantages in the pro-
gram.

Journalist Calls War
Integral Part Of Life

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

A different view of.war and its advantages to man-
kind was presented to the student body by Anthony H.

Harrigan in chapel Tuesday.

The audience was rather
sparse but apparently intensely
concerned with the journalist's
remarks.

“My subject is conflict,'' be-
gan Harirgan, associate editor
of The News and Courier. ‘‘The
conflict of our times are not
greater than those of the past."
as far as fury and emotion are
concerned. However, he pointed
out that, ‘today conflict is con-
ducted in a world-wide arena."
It has implications which no
one can escape.

“There is no place to hide. We
have no choice but to learn to
live with protracted conflict.”

ANTHONY HARRIGAN
“No Place To Hide”

The word protracted: is a key
one, according. to the speaker.
Wars such as we have today
would have been almost incon-
ceivable thirty years ago. “Then
people thought of warfare in
terms of a single decisive strug-

gle.”

Harrigan did not see war as
undiluted evil, however. ‘‘The
human cost of the wars of the
last 50 years has been terrible,”
he admitted. ‘‘Nevertheless,"' he
claimed, ‘‘vast new areas of
knowledge were opened up as a
result of competition on the bat-
tlefields."’ Citing the American
Civil War as an example, he
said that America went into the
Civil War as a rural nation and
emerged as a full-fledged indus-
trial state.

Thus we must not automatical-
ly shy away from war, but view
it with an eye to its potential
advantage.

The speaker emphasized that
the possibility of the necessity
for increased warfare is quite
real, “The Chinese Communists
have decided that the pursuit
of war is a pogitive good.’ In
the face of this belligerence the
Western nations “are the pro-
verbial lambs for the slaughter”
if they do not change their at-
titude toward war.

Then Harrigan let go with his
real bombshell. History. he
claimed, is the story of a con-
tinual struggle for power. “The
natural state of things is war.”

“The long drawn out period,”
McGavock said. “has been a
Strain on the upper classmen,
but has tended to reduce the
intensity of rush.”

He continued that there had
not been the build up of emotion.
al strain like there had been in
the past which was more com-
mon to the unpledging freshmen.
since they did not meet rejec-
tion at the beginning of the year.

Dr. John Kelton, associate
professor of psychology. said
that he could not comment on
the affects of rush on the fresh-
men, since he did not teach too
many in his department. but
that reports to him “have been
good.”

But commenting on the aca-
demic performance of the up
per classmen Kelton. said, ‘I
could tell a big difference at
the beginning of the semester:
we were off to a better start.”
He continued. ‘‘Rush did not in-
terfere with the upper-classmen
later, when rush came.”

COMPLAINTS

Outside of the classroom he
had heard complaints concern-
ing contact between the upper-
and lower-classmen. ‘I am sor-
ry that there were such strict
rules on contact between fresh-
men and upper-classmen; this is
the biggest complaint,”’ he con-
cluded.

Charles Cornwell, instructor in
English. did not think the rush
rules had ‘unduly harmed the
freshmen or the fraternity
men," and there had been no

interference with work.
LEGALISM
The biggest objection from the
students, according to him, was
the extreme legalism determin-

ing the contact between the
freshmen and fraternity men,
and he termed them ‘excessive
and undue.”

Continuing, Cornwell stated,
“I see no reason in not declar-
ing open season on freshmen,
and it would enable the fresh-
men to meet the upper-class-
men,”’

Walt Drake, president of ATO,
said that rush this year had
been a burden on the freshmen
and fraternity men which was
not necessary.

OLD SYSTEM

“T prefer a system of rush
concentrated in a short period,”
he stated. and generally he pre-
fers the system of rush. which
has been used in the past.
“There is individual merit -in
the delayed rush,’ Drake con-,
cluded, ‘‘but overall, it was not
as good as hoped.”

Ernie Larkin KA president,
said that “it wasn't running too
well, but we did benefit from. it
this year, we have learned to be
honest with rush.”

He continued that after this
year either rush will be opened
up. or it will be closed. ‘This
half-way basis should come to
an end.’ concluded Larkin, but
‘the main thing we learned was
how not to do things.”

Bill Skinner, president of
Sigma Nu, said that rush was
better than last year, but “‘it
was too long and dragged out.
Delaying for part of the year is
good, but more contact is need
ed, like riding in cars."

However, Skinner stated, “‘the
delayed rush doesn’t seem to
have made much difference in
the composition of the pledge
classes."”

The drinking rule vote. one
more than the needed two-thirds,
repeals Section 2 of the Student
Body Regulations. Abrogation of
the gambling rule failed by only
a few votes.

This result is a reversal of
last May's campaign to repeal
the drinking regulation when
only °62 per cent of the votes
favored repeal...

This year’s referendum was
the result of a re evaluation of
Honor Court and Student Coun.
cil responsibilities led by John
Burks. Another aspect of ‘this
re-evaluation is the new “duty
bound” clause in the oath .of
office to be administered to the
Honor Court and Student Coun-
cil on Monday.

COUNCIL

Student Body President Bill
Council Tuesday night comment-
ed on the vote. and what it
means, ‘The repeal of the drink-
ing rule,"' stated Council, ‘is
not the result of a general desire
of the students to consume alco-
holic beverages on campus. It is
a result of student feeling that’
the rule is unrealistic and serves
no definite end."

Council said that he does not
believe that drinking on the Dav:
idson campus will result in ex-
treme disorderly conduct and
disruption of the academic at-
mosphere.

He further indicated that the
faculty was strongly committed
to a dry campus and that there
was a possibility of dorm and
room searches authorized by the
faculty. It is also probable that
the trunk rule will be repealed,
according to. Council.
DEFINITE RESPONSIBILITY

“The action taken by the stu-
dents."’ said Council, ‘‘requires
that they show a definite respon-
sibility and maturity, If they do
act with responsibility, they will
be able to maintain a certain
amount of jurisdiction.”

Council also said, ‘‘We will
have to wait and see if the
trustees take definite action. The
administration has,’ however,
made statements to the effect
that if the students repeal the
drinking rule, there may be an
increase in security officers to
enforce dorm searches,”’ added
Council.

BURKS

John Burks, who initiated the
referendum, was surprised that
the drinking rule was the first
to go. “I think that this shows
that the student body at large
does not wdnt to be responsible
for enforcing such a regulation.

“I also think that the fact that

the drinking rule was the only
one to be repealed was due in
part to the students placing ‘a
great deal of emphasis and
thought on this one and not con-
sidering the difficulty in the en-
forcement of some of the
others,"’ said Burks.

Burks did not. believe that’the
administration would take any
arbitrary policing action such
as room searches.

ANOTHER REFERENDUM

Burks also stated that. he
would not be surprised if another
referendum were held during
next semester on some of the
rules that were not repealed.

Burks said that student courts
should be concerned with im-
portant regulations and that de-
manding the whole student body
or any group of students to be

responsible for very poorly de-
fined regulations places undue
Strain on student government.

“If the administration sees
that we are responsible, I think
we can realistically hope they
will condone on-campus drink-
ing.’ commented senior David
Meschan, a member of the Stu-
dent Council. “If; however, we
show a lack of responsibility in
this regard, they would be per-
fectly justified in taking string-
ent action.”

SIMPSON

Paul Simpson. who defended
the drinking rule in chapel this
week, commented that he feels
“the administration, if it be-
comes evident that students are
drinking on campus, will take
any necessary action to see tha:
this does not continue,” but
added that he does not expect a
significant increase in on-cam-
pus drinking.

Burks agreed, “I think there
will be more drinking on campus
than there has been in the past.
but I don’t think it will be very
significant.”

Wednesday's referendum. fol-
lowed a similar vote last spring
when the regulations were re-
tained. Meschan attributed the
change to the fact that fresh-
men, who usually are more con-
servative than upperclassmen,
could not vote this time.

Union Cafeteria Gets
Replacement For Hill

The College Union cafeteria
this week received a new resi-
dent manager, William T. Beck-
ham, the third man to hold the
position since last spring.

Beckham replaces Harry Hill,
who recently resigned from
Slater Food Services.

A college official was non-
committal as to whether Hill's
resignation was connected with
the large number of complaints
the Slater Service has received

his visit here Tuesday. At left is Rufus Adalr, and at right is Bilt Alexander.

TROOPING THE LINE

Col, James A. Scott, center, chief of the ROTC Division of the Third Army, reviews Davidson’s ROTC Corps during

about conditions in the David-
son cafeteria.

He added that Hill underwent
an emergency appendectomy
last week and that his illness
might have influenced his de-
cision to resign.

The official stated that the col-
lege asked the Slater Service
early last fall to improve the
food and service in the cafeteria.
He added that Slater has been
trying to do something about
the situation ever since then.

In adidtion to Beckham, Slater
has also hired a new North Caro-
lina district manager, Wayne
Shroyer. who worked at David-
son for a short time last spring.

Registration Policy
Changes Effected

Concrete results of Davidson's
recent Self-Study Report were
offered by registrar F. W. Hen-
geveld this week in the form of
a new policy for second semes-
ter registration.

Under the new policy every
student must consult a faculty
adviser concerning his schedule,
even if he is taking continuous
courses such as Math 11, 12.

All students have received
schedule sheets, which must

ture before Saturday's deadline
for registration.

“We have felt for some time
that this would be a good idea,"
noted Hengeveld, ‘but we were
uncertain as to the mechanical
angle of the process, which will
evidently result in much paper
work.”
