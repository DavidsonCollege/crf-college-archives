If you can remember back to 1984
when the English synth trio, Talk Talk,
released It’s My Life, keep remembering.
In fact take a listen to it or buy it if you
have a chance, but don’t spend eight dol-
lars on their latest record, The Colour of
Spring. Despite some of the band’s finest
production and precise musicianship on
vinyl, this record lacks depth and sub-
stance. I say this only because of the
quality that distinguished their last two
efforts. As opposed to the driving rhythm
and the “wall of sound” production tech-
niques that dominated that earlier efforts,
Talk Talk opted for a stripped and slowed
down sound that highlighted vocals and
instrumentals.

Unfortunately, the group succeeded
only in exposing the limits of Mark Hollis
as a lead singer and songwriter. The re-
sult (with a couple of exceptions) is a
series of slow, dull songs that lack ten-
sion and substance, but sound great. For
instance, “Chameleon Day” (1 think that
the only reason that this one was included
was because its title justifies the band’s
jump onto the psychaelie bandwagon) is

Accredited courses in government,

an uninteresting, bland piece that has
Hollis backed by a single synth while he
oozes about, “break on me, eclipse my
mind.”

However, their are a couple of jewels
in this trash heap. “I Don’t Believe In
You” is one the best songs that the group
has recorded and “Living In Another
World” ranks with some of their better
work. But take my advice and leave The
Colour of Spring for the discount racks,
and if you don’t believe me, come by and
hear it.

I don't think that before their perfor-
mance here at Davidson's prestigious
900 Room last fail anyone around here
had heard of the Bangles. At that time
they were supporting their fascinating
debut LP, All Over The Place. Now amid
a lot of hooting and pointing by the music
press, the Bangles have released their fol-
low-up Different Light. This spirited
album is a good effort, but not quite as
fine as All Over The Place. Unlike that
record there are only a few exceptional
songs here and several good ones. Of
these few, “If She Knew What She

CAROLINA
=ABANK =

Wants” stands out as an excellent exam-
ple that combines sixties pop vocal styles
with eighties production values in lines
like, “Why would anyone try / To walk a
line when they could fly.” But I can’t un-
derstand why the band has recorded such
throw-away pop numbers as “Manic
Monday” and “Walking Down Your
Street” beside choice cuts like “In A Dif-
ferent Light” and “Walk Like An Egyp-
tian” unless their goal was crass commer-
cialism. Perhaps this tendency towards
commercialism is why this album is more
accessible (but less listenable) than their
debut.

The band has chosen to expand their
sound but without refining it. The Bang-
les’ dilemma within their style is that, as
they put it, “some have a style / That they
work hard to refine / So they walk a
crooked line.” It seems that the Bangles
have choosen to walk the crooked line of
intentional commercial success, for this
album at least. Nonetheless, Different
Light is certainly an enjoyable album that
will hold you over until the Bangles’ re-
lease a third album.

If you remotely liked the recent single

Wednesday, March 26, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Dream Academy, Bangles and Talk, Talk

by the Dream Academy, “Life in a North-
ern Town” then you'll probably love their
self- titled debut album, The Dream
Academy. This  synthesizer/aucoustic
guitar based English trio are rooted
deeply in late sixties pop and progressive
music with songs based on melodic
phrases rather than hooks. The well-
crafted album is as smooth and sensual as
silk and owes this to superior production
by former Pink Floyd guitarist David Gil-
mour. This is one of those rare records
that you can put on the turntable, sit back,
close your eyes, and be carried off by (as
the name implies).

The music opens the mind without
alienating or patronizing the listener. The
big suprise is singer Nick Laird-Clowes'
lyrics which are intrigingly subtle. The
Dream Academy uses the studio well as
just an other instrument (with credit to
Gilmour). For this reason I know that to
see them live would be nothing short of
disappointment. Favorite tracks include:
“Gohnny) New Light,” “The Edge of
Forever,” “Bound to Be,” and “The Love
Parade.”
