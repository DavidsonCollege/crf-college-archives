Meet North Carolina in
: Contest Next Saturday

University Relay Team Will be in
Atlanta for Georgia Tech Meet

On Saturday afternoon the Davidson track

ball team rallied in the ninth inning of their; was a lot of glad hearts, and of course a team will meet the strong aggregation from

the University of North Carolina. This will
be the first time these two teams have met
in a number of years for a dual meet. From

Now we have Carolina to face again Sat- the past records of the two teams, indica-
Both teams slugged heavily during the | urday afternogn in a track meet. The Tar tions point toward one of the fastest meets

Carolina comes with the record of decisive
wins over strong tedms from Washington
and Lee and Duke. Their victory over the
former team was by the one-sided score of
88 to 38. Davidson likewise opened the
season with a win over Wofford and by the
same score as that of Carolina over Wash-
ington and Lee.

A part of the Carolina squad will not be
present Saturday. This part will go to At-
lanta to participate in the famous Georgia
Tech relays. This meet is the biggest event
of the Southern colleges track program and
the Carolina team is in line to win in a
number of events. For this reason the usual
mile relay will not be on the program for
the meet next Saturday.

The track on Richardson field will be in
fine shape for the meet. During the latter
part of March it was plowed up completely
and re-cindered. Recent rains have settled it
so that it will be in perfect condition for the
meet Saturday.

Coach Tilson has made a number of
changes in the arrangement of his men for
the races.. Chief among these is the change
of Alf Brand from the 220 and 440 to the
half mile. He has been showing up well in
this event. Penn has been doing brilliant
running in the two miles and unofficially
broke the college record for that event just
prior to the holidays. Williford, who for-
merly ran this race, has been shifted to the

mile,

Captain Anderson is the chief mainstay of
In the meet with Wofford he
scored 16 points, taking three first places and
one third. He was high point man for the
meet.

McPherson is the best runner for North
Carolina. He has been making fast time in
the dashes and will give Goodykoontz a close
race in these events. He may possibly make

the trip to Atlanta, but it is not thought
probable at the present time.

The team is remarkably free from injuries
of any sort and will be in fine fettle for the
meet.

When David Howard, and his room-mate,
“Goliath” Dillard, returned to Davidson after
the holidays, they, found their once beauti-
fully decorated room a wide-open space, its
usual decorative qualitjes conspicuous by
their absence. A thorough search, under the
direction of the Lone Indian, now famous
investigator and defective, was successful in
locating the missing articles. A number of
students on the fourth floor of Watts are
said to be afraid of scandal surrounding the
disappearance of these articles.

wasn't any question as to the final outcome,

no one would have known the outcome, for
it would be a hot race between these two
good men.

The tennis team is starting south soon.
Interest has lagged in this sport this year, |
jit seems to us. We don’t know what has |
| been the cause—whether it lacked someone |
|to push this sport, to lead it and to have a
lot of meets. By this time last year the ten-
|is team had been up against a great deal of |
Opposition. |

Manager Lawson, of the freshmar nine,
says it has been difficult to schedule games|
for the Wildkitten baseball team. We won-|
der if that is due to the fact that manager
of other teams think the football and basket-
ball teams have set a precedent in playing
ability and that consequently a game with
the Wildkittens would not be interesting from
the viewpoint of a contest. We were won-
dering ,that’s all, but we often wonder about
the freshman class this year. They do have
good track material, though.
