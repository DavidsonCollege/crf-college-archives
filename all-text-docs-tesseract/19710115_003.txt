Squirrels Threatened?

Stating that
a year-round concern,'’ the
Davidson ECOS chapter
broke its “relative silence
over the Christmas. break
with a concerted effort to
stop the shooting of squirrels
on the Davidson campus.

Inactive since the activi-
ties of last April's Earth
Day and torn internally by
a serious power _ strug-
gle, ECOS, according to
spokesman John Fine, has
united behind last year's
leader Pat Mullen to oppose

Grant Saves

‘A publication grant of
$5,000 has been given to the
Quips & Cranks, the David-
son College yearbook.

The grant, made available
to the yearbook staff by the
college administration, will

come from Davidson's Liv-

ing Endowment.

According to Tim Tim
mons, editor of the year-
book, it was essential that
the Quips & Crarths recieve
extra funds ‘‘or else we
could never have often the
yearbook out by the spring
term.’

Timmons, who convinced
Collegé .President Dr. Sam-
uel R. Spencer that the year-

will be phased out at the be-
ginning of the spring term,
according to Cafeteria Man-
_ ager: Klaus G, Kleeburg.

Kleeburg wil] become food
purchaser and nutrition ad-
viser to the twelve nonselec-
tive eating clubs, effective
March 22, the first day of
the: spring term.

His -job will ‘be to buy bulk
food from the United States
Department of Agriculture
food surplus stocks and dis-
tribute it to the twelve eat-
ing clubs for their use in
preparing ‘food.

As . nutrition adviser, he
will also pass around sug-
gested menus in order to aid
the clubs in preparing ap-
petizing and wholesome
' meals.

‘When asked whether the
food served at the clubs
wou'd be as s.archy and

greasy as the meals present-
ly served by the Union cafe-
teria, Kleeburg said, “I hope
hat I will be able to telp
the eating clubs to maintain
the reputation of high
qualty food which the cafe-
teria has always enjoyed."’

The college, according to
Kleeburg, has no plans on
what to do with the cafe-
teria space.

‘Pete Nicholls,"’ said Klee-
burg, “Wants to make a
game room out of it. He says
we could move the pool
tables in there and set up
a few pinball machines. I'm
sure the pinball machines
would pay for themselves.”

Asked whether the change
would result in many frater-

nity members eating off.

squirrels on the Davidson

campus and in the immedi-

ate area of the town sur-
rounding the campus.

Such an event = might
change seriously the natural
ecosystem of this area with
disastrous consequences for
several species of wildlife.
According to Associate Pro-
fessor of Biology W. 'T. Lam-
mers the danger is real, and
“Shooting too many squir-
rels might cause an increase
in less desirable ground fo-
dents such as chipmunks."’

Gant, however, said that
he had personally never seen
any_ damage caused by shoot-
ing squirrels. And in fact,
he said that he began the
practice only at the request
of several town residents.

“They requested the ac-
tion and continue to request
it,"’ Gant said,

Gant also revealed that
several Davidson students
had joined him in his daily
hunts and that many were in
his words, ‘remarkable
shots to be so young.”

(Mullen, however, said he
would fight” the practice
even if everyone at David-

son took it up. ‘‘When the
environment is at stake,”
‘Mullen said, ‘people will

just have to learn to make
sacrifices.

“The. Davidson ECOS is
determined that this sacri
fice will be made."
