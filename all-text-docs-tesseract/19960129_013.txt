The Naked Truth

Hypnotist mesmorizes audience

By Jay Hupson

Last Saturday evening, amidst
the music of The Twilight Zone
and Andrew Lloyd Webber, Dr.
Holiday, a world renowned hyp-
notist, performed his tricks. In
front of a packed 900 Room, Holi-
day proceeded to hypnotize 13
volunteers, making them perform
antics that would normally get
themselves shunned from all so-
cial circles.

According to Holiday, hyp-
nosis is “a natural, relaxed, sleep-
like state of mind induced by sug-
gestion.” Everybody enters hyp-
nosis when they fall asleep and
what Holiday terms the alpha-state.
Under hypnosis people enter a state
of complete relaxation and leave
the world of stress and confusion.
The victim of hypnosis is aware of

what is happening in his/her im-
mediate surroundings, but only
pays attention to the hypnotist’s
voice.

After Holiday explained the
theory behind his methods, he
promptly hypnotized 13 Davidson
students, In this particular state,

.the volunteers were open to any

kind of suggestion.

He convinced one student that
she was a movie star and another
that he was a world-class body-
builder. At any round of applause,
these two either started acting like
a flamboyant Hollywood celeb-
rity or flexing their muscles in
Schwarzenneger fashion.

Holiday then queried the
group to see if anyone wanted to
demonstrate their singing abili-
ties. One sang a selection from
Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Evita.
Another sang a tune switching

from English to Japanese on com-
mand. .
Although earlier in the perfor-
mance Holiday claimed that he
would not make anyone take off
their clothes, he did not hesitate in
making the male volunteers act like

_ erotic dancers. He did stop the strip

tease when a couple of the more
overzealous. dancers began to re-
move their pants.

At the end of the performance
Holiday planted two hypnotic sug-
gestions in the minds of the victims
in gratitude for being subjects. One
suggestion was not to fall asleep
behind the wheel of an automobile,
and the other was to remember ev-
erything studied and remain calm
in examination situations.

Whether or not these hypnotic
suggestions work, the crowd en-
joyed watching the volunteers per-
form under the power of Holiday.

Acoustic funk

By WiLL Foy
Staff Writer

From the first spirited strains
of “Smilin’ Down” to the final
chords of “Jump, Little Children,”
Charleston, SC’s band Jump, Little
Children had the crowd at
Asheville’s club Be Here Now on
their feet. Many of the crowd

traveled from Columbia, Charles-
ton, and parts in between to help
the locals welcome the quintet.
To more properly acquaint
you with the band, let me intro-
duce them from stage right'to left.
Durham’s Jonathan Gray plays

double bass and sings. Next to

him, on acoustic and electric gui-
tars, and lead vocals, stands Jay

gets Asheville jumping

Clifford. To Clifford’s left, Matt
Bivens performs melodica, har-
monica, accordion, whistles, man-
dolin, and lead vocals with a rap-
influenced delivery.

Seated on his left, the man on
the cello, mandolin, electric guitar,
and vocals is Ward Williams. Per-
cussionist Evan Bivens completes
Jump, Little Children on his small

but mighty kit.

As you can probably discern,
alarge emphasis is placed on acous-
tic instruments. This stems from
one of their principle influences —
Irish folk music.

Throughout the performance,
the artists danced, hopped, sang,
played, and delivered a complete
visual and audio experience, com-

plete with. Rocky Horror-esque
crowd reactions, showing
everyone’s involvement in the per-
formance.

Jump is in the process of a
record deal with several players in
the mix. Until then, see them at
Amos’s when they open for
Jackopierce Feb. 2 or Jack Straw’s
on the 9th.
