On Thursday evening, Sept.
4, while most were preparing for
‘the trek here to Davidson, I has the
distinct pleasure of being cram-
med into a small club in my
hometown with ‘about 250 other

out eyery oritice on my body, I
asked myself, “Why am I here?”
Just then an energetic band of six
led by a young lass of 24 stormed

the stage, and my question was

answered. The band was none
other than Fetchin’ Bones and the
night was one which I will not

Fetchin’ Bones are a Char-

how to have a good time. The
band is led by lead singer Hope
a Davidson native.
Their music has often been refer-
red to as “white trash rock:” It is
something to the effect of R.E.M.

match. Hope’s voice is penetrat-
ing and she does not attempt to
hide her southern twang. Gary

“schizophrenic oscillation be-

‘tween hardcore and country fla-

vored rock.” His licks are quite

aid in the vocals. The rhythm sec-
tion, composed of co-founder
Aaron Pitkin on guitar, bassist/
violinist Donna Peters and drum-

minimalist beat. Mueller’s jerky

folk to thrash. Their live show is
fantastic. Their ravenousness on
stage pervades every member of
the audience insisting that every-
one enjoy themselves. Hope says,
“If there’s any purpose behind our
music, it’s to make people be able
to go out and have fun.”
Hope’s father, Stephen
Davidson. “Hope has always been
interested in singing and writing
since she was a child,” he said. He
went on to tell me that most of
their success came at the Miles-

other groups and, “after a while
they were the band and others
were introduced.” Presently, the
group is touring with R-E.M.,
who Nicholls says has been very
helpful to his daughter’s band.
Fetchin’ Bones will release a
new album in October as a follow

their first effort. They will be

Wyoming is a state which has
plagued the public consciouness as long

as it has existed. Nary a day goes by when

your average guy or gal on the street .

doesn’t. wonder, what’s happening in
“the equality state” right now?

My own fascination with the state
began with a stimulating tour of the Buf-
falo Bill Museum. Though I was little
more than 10, I was afforded the tre-
mendous honor of coming within mere

feet of actual glass balls Annie Oakley’s

sure-shot Remington missed — these
trinkets are extremely rare indeed — as

well as a stirring wall-sized mural ‘of

cowboys and Indians (they still don’t call
them native Americans there) clenched in
violent battle.

My curiosity about Wyoming led me
on a quest to'plumb the collective knowl-
edge of Davidson college on that state.

I began by asking Mary Anne Hos-
kins ’87 what she knew about Wyoming.

Her reply was, “Big open spaces, lots of

Anne! It’s kind of West and North too.
To be precise, it lies between latitudes 41
and 45 north, and logitudes 104 and 111
west. But at least Miss Hoskins was more
successful than Chery! Connor (’89)
who, when asked if she could tell her in-
terviewer where wyoming was, said,
“No, I can’t.”

. Some students claimed they could
find it on an unmarked map. None, how-
ever, could compete with Derek French
(°89). Derek fashioned a map out of the
palm of his left hand with his thumb serv-
ing as Florida. He then pointed to the first

knuckle of his ring finger saying, “That’s .

Wyoming there.”

Many reported that Wyoming is the
home fof many cowboys, including the
blue one frozen in a mighty equine leap
on the state’s license plate. Economics
professor Clark Ross brought the grand
myth of the Wyoming cowboy into the
modern era when he related‘a recent trip
to the world-famous frontiers Day festi-
val in Cheyenne: “I felt rather out: of

raches.” Her answer began an interesting — place. There were guys wearing cowboy

precedent, for it seems that for most eve-
tbody Wyoming triggers a synapse in the
tongue which invariably creates the
words “lots,” and “big” several.times in a
single sentence.

I asked Miss Hoskins where Wyom- —_

ing was located and learned, “Out west:
it’s north too, right?” Wrong, Mary

L-

clothes leaning out of vans with beers and
yelling.”

Ross’ peer, Charles Ratliff, claimed
that people from Wyoming méasure dis-
“tance in beer.

I was quite surprised to find that most
people’s knowledge about this proud

_ State was rather limited. When asked

what she thought of when someone men-~

tioned Wyoming, Leanne Steele (’88) as-
serted, “Nothing.” °

Even head reference librarian Mary
Beatty Ph.D was a bit stumped:

Beaty: I’m not going to expose my ig-
norance of Wyoming to the public gaze.
Myself: Can I quote you on that?

Beaty? Yes.

Beaty did, however, recall’ a book
from her childhood (I think librarians are
requried to recall the titles of every book
they’ve read) called The Green Grass of
Wyoming from which she gathered that
the state is replete with “lots of grass and
horses.”

My questioning took an interesting
tum when Edgar Gamponia (’89) asked,
“don’t they store MX missles in Wyom-
ing?” Ben Yarbrough (’89), who was
posititve Wyoming was square, was not
so sure about the missles. Amy Cheek
(°88) knew nothing of the silos but could
tell me a bit about Edgar Gamponia:

“Edgar is (what is it?) Korean? Or Viet-

namese? He’s not Filipino.”

Sheryl Aikman (’87), who had actu-
ally spent time in Wyoming, finally set-
tled the issues saying, “If Wyoming sec-

¢-eded it would be the third most powerful .
nation in the World.” Point well made,

Sheryl!
As exciting as Wyoming seems from
its license plates, people have surpris-

ingly few amusing anecdotes to tell. Pro- |

fessor Ratliff told of having to take High-
way 15 and then the alternate 15A in
order to reach the glacier he eventually
drove through in 1980.

Aikman was a little more amusing
when she told, anecdotally, of the time
she learned to two-step (that’s a cowboy
dance) in a bar in a town of 204 people
“It was during the woodchoppers festival
which attracts every lumberjack and
Hell’s Angel west of the Mississippi.” |

But the best amusing anecdote by far
came from Economics professor Chris
Bell. Bell told of a hitcher he picked up in
Wyoming who was earlier picked up by a
kindly gentelman who offered his rider
new clothes and a place to stay. After a

‘week the young man’s benefactor told of

a business proposition he had. The two
were accompanied by the son of the man
when they drove up to a mountain cabin.
They told the traveler to go to the cabin
where they would meet him later. The
young man, however, smelled a rat and

hightailed into the woods where he was. -

picked up by police who said the men
were serial murderrs of hitchhikers.

Myself: (excitedly) All this happened
in Wyoming?

Bell: (apologetically) Well, it hap-

pend in Utah but I picked. hirh up in
Wyoming.
__ Myself: (disappointedly) Oh.
