This year, Davidson sits at
number 11 among the nation’s 160
liberal arts colleges, according to
U. S. News & World Report’s
“America’s Best Colleges” issue
which goes on sale today.

Davidson’s overall score is

90.2 out of 100. Broken up, we
rank 15th in academic reputation,
9th in student selectivity, 57th in
faculty resources, 22nd in finan-
cial resources, 12th in reputation,
and 6th in annual giving.

In ‘94-95, “America’s Best
Colleges” proclaimed Davidson
the eighth best liberal arts school.
However, Davidsonians’ pride in
the ranking was short-lived. When
the annual college guide published
its ‘95-96 rankings, the powers that
be at U. S. News & World Report
cast Davidson down an unexpected
13 places. While the school man-
aged to retain a berth among the

Top 25 National Liberal Arts Col-
leges, it didn’t hang on by much:
Davidson spent the year at an
uncelebrated 21st place ranking.
Criticized in recent years for
failing to check data supplied by
schools and for making small com-
putational errors, U.S. News ranks
national colleges and universities
separately. Rankings are based on
18 factors, including a school’s
Academic Reputation, Faculty and
Financial Resources, Retention
Rate, Education Expenditures Per
Student, and students’ SAT/ACT

scores.

Following last year’s down-
ward slide to 21, Dayidson’s Di-
rector of Institutional Research
John Kelton went to Washington
D.C. to speak with U. S. News
officials.

“Davidson didn’t change and
I don’t think our peer institutions
changed either,” says Kelton of
Davidson’s recent ranking fluc-
tuations. “The major thing last

Davidson, but hits
home for some

With an RLO hurricane update
hotline, requests for cellular phones and
flashlights, and campus police urging
students to move their cars away from

fury on Thursday night.

RLO staff was under instructions to
monitor the whereabouts of their advisees.
“We had to make sure [our freshwomen]
were here or knew where they were,”
says Hall Counselor Jennifer Sanborn
98. “We tried to make sure they had
flashlights... [because RLO] told us to
expect a power outage.”

When Davidson was spared the brunt
of the storm most breathed sighs of relief.
However, two cars were smashed when
an old tree in front of Chambers came
crashing to the ground on Friday.

But some students, especially resi-
dents of Raleigh and Wilmington, weren’t

trees, Davidson was ready for Fran’s

My family automobile, which we’ve
had for 12 years, was totaled when atree fell

from Raleigh. “A tree fell on the house,
and they’ ve had to close streets. There’s
still no power, and they just got phone
service back [yesterday].”

E.H. Little library makes big changes

By ANDREW PRESTON

Students will be pleasantly surprised
this fall with the changes in E.H. Little
Library.

Dr. Leland Park, Library Director, de-
scribed many changes in the library that will
give students more research tools. Thirteen
PC work stations were added, all equipped
with Netscape for Web access. The Biblio-
graphic Instruction PC, located in the 24
hour room, was upgraded for access to the
Web via Netscape.

Project Muse, a set of 19 on-line aca-
demic journals published by Johns Hopkins
University Press, was also added. This new

capability allows students to find informa-
tion quickly from many different sources,
including Web sites for government docu-
ments of the President’s daily speeches and
a tour of the White House. The Library also
has its own home page.

The biggest improvement was the ad-
dition of the Z39.50 module to CHAL which
allows CHAL users to use standard software
when accessing other libraries, so that users
only need to know one set of commands.
Park states, “Eventually all good libraries
will have this ... For now, Davidson is one of
the first.”

The Encyclopedia Britannica was added
on-line with full text and prints, as well as
“the ability to search by topic throughout the

entire set, not just via the index,” Park ex-
plains. Five indices that were previously
offered on CD Romare also currently avail-
able online (Medline, MLA, Econlit,
Sociofile, PAIS), so that several people can
use them at once.

Research materials weren’t the only .

additions; three copy machines and a fax are
being installed, as well as a CHAL hotline.

Furthermore, e-mail was moved “so
that those using e-mail will have more unin-

terrupted time and those needing to access... -

Resources on CHAL can have access to
terminals.” says Park.

Gravedigging in Davidson

By ALLISON DoLpH

Just a short walk down Main Street is a
quiet place, full of serenity and the legacies
of the past. The Davidson College Cem-
etery is the final resting place of nine past
mayors, ten college presidents, and 12

| William Andrew perenne ie class of

1895, met his death on one of those rare
winter days when a lake near Davidson
froze enough to go ice skating. He never
even got a chance to lace up his skates.
William, better known as “Arnie,” was so
excited about the sudden blast of cold weather
that he ran upstairs in Old Chambers to grab
his skates. On his way back down, Arnie fell
over the railing to the floor below and died
two days later.

There was the Bavarian workman,
Mathias Engle, who was killed while quar-
rying rock for the construction of Old Cham-
bers. Out of gratitude for his labor, the town
of Davidson erected an honorary monument
in the college cemetery.

Trains did not arrive in Davidson until

1860, so students were buried at the College

Cemetery because there was no way to ship
their bodies home. In 1854, while a student
at Davidson, John Stitt Williamson died of
smallpox. Several months later his father,
Samuel Williamson, then president of the
college, personally vaccinated each
Davidson student against smallpox.

thing there is to see in tiny Davidson ...
