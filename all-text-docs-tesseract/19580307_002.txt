Here Are The Issues: Campus
Politicians Should Take Stands

Elections are about to begin on
campus again. Every year we hear
the same old story that there are no
issues here at Davidson. This may
have been true in some past years,
but it is not true today.

We have several problems that
affect every student on campus. It
is the duty. therefore, for all men who
aspire to any student body office to
express publicly and clearly how
they stand on the important issues.

The DAVIDSONIAN has taken
stands on many issues this vear—both
local and national questions. Below we
summarize what our stand has been
on the local campus issues in hope
that election candidates will familiarize
themselves with the issues and arrive
at their own particular views.

- This year. the DAVIDSONIAN has
stood for:

1. The formation of an Honor
Council separate from the student
council, and appointed by a student-
faculty committee.

2. The elimination of collection at
Vespers. Furthermore, we favor mak-
ing Comniunion’ Vespers a voluntary
service, but reaffirm our support for
required Vesper and Chapel services
which are in keeping with the tradi-
tional policy of Davidson College.

3. The adoption of a preferrentia!
bidding system..The primary purpose
of this new system would be to limit
the number of men in each fraternity.

4. The removal of fraternity in-
terference in the mechanies of con-
firmation of rush week dates, the be-
ginning of rush week a week earlier
than last year and a more mature
policy toward Hell Week. The IFC has
approved all three of these actions.

5. The modification of the drink-

ing rule to allow students to come
back to campus “under the influence.”
Upon further consideration, however,
it seems clear that any relaxing in
the drinking rule would eventually re-
sult in breaking down Davidson's high
standards of an alcohol-free campus.

For this reason, we feel that if
any change is to be made, it should
be in the direction of strengthening
the present rule rather than in relax-
ing it.

6. The revision of the college cur-
riculum to make it more stimulating
and vital. This could be done by the
elimination of many dead - wood re-
quired courses. and the consolidation
of others.

7. The placing of phone booths in
the Union to permit more privacy
when making a call.

8. The establishment of a Parents
Day for upperclassmen.

‘9. The fraternity system as we
know it here at Davidson, its neces-
sary policy that supports the Ameri-
can tradition of freedom of associa-
tion, and the single unit fraternity
houses which have now become a
reality.

10. The reversal of the Trustee’s
decision to increase the enrollment.
We believe that Davidson College can
best serve its own people by remain-
ing a very small Southern liberal arts
college. At the same time we do sup-
port the increase in faculty salaries.
and look forward to the day when
they will be on a level with the east-
ern schools.

These then are some of the issues
that election candidates can take a
stand on. These are issues that affect
the student body and the college.

Pay TV Seems
Worth The Try

Proponents of pay television have
eharged that the anti-pay TV cam-
paign is one of the most misleading
drives ever launched in this country
for the purpose of fooling the public
and protecting a special interest.

As we understand the situation,
pay television is simply an additional
entertainment service. It is entirely
separate from the present arrange-
ment of programs and would not, as
we understand it. have any effect on
the present programs that viewers are
accustomed to see.

In other words, pay TV would be
a new innovation whereby people who
want to could put in their quarters
and see top rate movies, Broadway
plays. and better quality entertain-
ment than is now offered by the na-
tional networks.

It is clear that the quality of pro-
grams on TV today ranges from the
most terrible to the very excellent.
The average program is really not
worth the time it takes to view it.
There are, on the other hand, many
good television programs—particular-
ly the live sports, political, and musi-
cal activities. .

At present, the Federal Communi-
cations Commission has voted to con-
sider whether or not pay TV should
be permitted to make a try at the new
system. If subscription television is al-
lowed to be tried, it seems fair to
predict that two things will happen.

First, it would force the national
networks to improve the quality of
programs to regain the audience lost
by the high quality pay TV programs.

Secondly, it will give those people who
are willing to pay the opportunity to
see programs that they would not
otherwise be able to see.

The only possible loser in the
whole game would be those individ-
uals and corporations who are willing
to risk their money in promoting the
new system. The public, it seems, has
nothing to lose.

If pay TV is approved by the FCC,
television viewers can take their
choice. It is worth a try.

ElectionChanges
Another Hurdle

The Student Council should be
congratulated for approving the need-
ed election reforms which it passed
at its Monday night meeting.

We support. moreover, the Coun-
cil’s action in voting down the pro-
posal'to have the Editor of the Scripts
and Pranks selected by a-board rather
than by student body election.

In future years, the students
should resist al! attempts to eliminate
stiident body election of the various
editors. Too often candidates for the
editorships are equally qualified and
to allow a board to select them would
be unfair and at the same time take
away a feeling of responsibility to
the student body.

It will now be up to the students
to pass on the amendments to the
Constitution which the Council has
approved. These three (see page one)
amendments would help to streamline
our elections as well as to acquaint the
electorate with the candidates.

They deserve the support of the
student body

DECISION SOON

YMCA President Favors. National Affiliation

By LLOYD CHAPIN

In April. 1957 the YMCA
Board of Directors instructed
the newly appointed Cabinet to
conduct a year long study of
our affiliation with the national
YMCA. This study, a “high pri-
ority project,” was to examine
the advantages of separation in
addition to those resulting from
continued membership in the
national movement.

For the past seven months
the Cabinet has been la-
boring over this problem
and the task is not yet over;
however, it is now possible
to outline several consid-
erations which make it de-
sirable to remain within
the framework of the na-
tional “Y".

First of all. our student body
with its homogeneous economic
and geographic background is
naturally inclined toward a nar-
rowly provincial viewpoint. Con-
nection with the national “Y"
offers opportunities for broad-
ening our outlook through state,

regional, and national confer-
ences, as well as through guest
speakers and printed materials.

STUDENT BODY

If we have failed to derive
benefit from these sources in
the past, the fault lies largely
with ourselves. Membership in
the campus “Y” movement
forms a bond between students
all over the United States and
abroad, and to sever the link
would be one more step toward
shutting out the world around
us,

Our “Fair Share” paid
yearly to the central office
is $275, approximately three
per cent of our annual bud-
get. Are we getting our
money’s worth? t think so.
Whenever a locel associa-
tion needs professional as-
sistance in conducting mem-
bership drives, program
planning, or counsel of any
kind, it is entitled to an ex-
pense free visit from “Y”
personnel.

In our case. this usually means
an annual visit by a staff mem-

ber from the regional head-
quarters in Atlanta. This money
also finances “Y” publications,
such as the Intercollegian and
devotional booklets. It subsi-
dizes conferences, program ma-
terials, workshops, and numer-
ous other smaller items.

LONG RUN LOSS

It is true that this $275 might
be invested in a project which
would produce more direct and
obvious benefits, but in the long
run the losses incurred by
breaking with the national or-
ganization and its resources
would probably so weaken the
effectiveness of our local asso-
ciation that it could not dis-
charge any of its responsibili-
ties adequately.

Another consideration is the
rapid growth in recent years of
denominational fellowships for
college students. These organi-
zations have an important func-
tion to perform in the realm
of religious education and _ in-
spiration, but their existence
and influence make it all the

COW IN CHAPEL

Birth Of An Honor System

By TOMMY COLVIN

The present. student body of
Davidson College possesses a
marvelous blessing, an honor
system that works. This honor
system grew as the college
grew,

The idea of an honor system
was conceived when Davidson
College first madé its appear-
ance on the education scene.

LETTER TO EDITOR

During the following years the
idea continued to develop until
1888. when the college felt a
firm kick within the stomach
and went into labor pains. One
morning in this memorable year
the administration awoke to find
several cows in chapel.

The acting president, Col. W.
J. Martin, did not, appreciate
this fine example of collegiate

Noise In Chapel, Vespers

Dear Mr. Editor:

I sure do like chapel better
than vespers, don’t you? Why,
in chapel, we get up and shout
out our groans, whistles and
hisses while in vespers we just
pussy-foot around and whisper.

Looks like we wouldn’t make
all that distinction between the
two, I guess it's because God
doesn’t come to chapel. Of
course He sits up front in ves-
pers so that it shouldn't bother
us in the back seats and the
balcony.

RACKET

1 figure it's best that God
sits up there and doesn’t notice
us. Come to think of it, I guess
we don't make as large a racket
in vespers because He might
hear and wow, would we be in
trouble! ‘Course what He don’t

know won’t cause any disturb-
ances to me.’

L think we really did impress
those Coker girls last Sunday.
No offense against Professor
Plott and his bunch, but last
Sunday was mighty good. Any-
how, like I was saying, we real-
ly impressed those chicks. They
were sitting up front where they
couldn't laugh and carry on, too,
but they got a kick out of it,
you could tell.

SHARP MOVES

Yeah, .it’s right nice to be
able to make these sharp moves
and the thing of it is that God
doesn’t know about it. We've
actually figured out a way to
go in God’s house, or just about
anything and still be able to
hide from him. Great, isn’t it?

humor. C. G. Vardell. a transfer
student from Oberlin who had
had some outside experience in
the line of student government,
was asked to investigate this
incident for the faculty. Another
student investigated the
dent for the student body.

A trial was held, and the of-
fenders were given their sen-
tences. This incident was a fore-
shadowing of our student gov-
ernment. (Outside experience
and ideas are not always bad.)

Soon Davidson College gave
birth to the infant student gov-
ernment. During the previous
years, there had been little uni-
ty among the different classes,
and each class was responsible
for the behavior of its own
members.

In 1896 the classes, while still
responsible for the activities of
their own members. were united
under a new set-up by a stu-
dent body president. The stu-
dent body president and the
class officers proceeded to form
an unofficial. unrecognized
council.

However, the infant was born
with a maladjustment — the
freshmen. The freshmen class
officers often showed lack of
discretion in disciplining the
members of its class who broke
the college rules. As a cure, the
student body in 1910 officially
established the Student Coun-
cil, which took over the disci-
plinary functions of the classes.

more important that students
have available a non-denomina-
tional lay group in which they
may study faith and life in an
environment free from the
boundaries of tradition, canon,
or rubric.

in addition we find that
in college, even in a church
supported one, mos? stu-
dents find it difficult to re-
late the fragments of truth
and partial insights received
from books, teachers, and
friends into a unified and
coherent view of fife. The
YMCA, a bias free and pres-
sure free movement pri-
marily concerned with the
intelfectual and spiritual
welfare of young men, is
thus uniquely fit to help
students formulate an intel-
ligent and workable faith.

Disturbed by the liberal so-
cial policies of the national
“Y", particularly regarding race
relations, many Davidson stu-
dents fear that membership de-
mands support of these views.
This fear is unnecessary. Each
local association is autonomous.

We are neither coerced nor even
urged to support national policy.
On the contrary, we are con.
stantly urged to criticize and
evaluate it. Racially intergrated
conferences are part of the “Y”
program, but these have been
occuring since the twenties.

NO ALTERNATIVE

From a purely negative stand-
point, it might be observed thaf
if we should withdraw our af-
filiation, we would have no
other place to go. There is no
sensible alternative available ex.
cept complete independence and
this would entail the disadvant-
ages outlined above.

In conclusion it should be
pointed out that affiliation is
not the real problem facing Da-
vidson’s “Y.” Poor internal
structure, a lack of movement
consciousness on the part of
members, and general student

apathy are the issues with which.

the “Y’” must come to grips
if it is to be a dynamic re-
ligious force. Severing connec:
tions with the national YMCA
is not the answer.

ON CAMPUS

PLEDGES REBELLING

By CHARLES HELMS

The K.A. pledges had their fling, (lifted the brothers’
mattresses during fraternity meeting, ‘‘stored” them in Bill
Pomeroy’s room), but their triumph was short-lived. The
actives made monkeys out of the ring leaders; Jim
Richardson and Hardy Wylie ate their lunch in trees.

And even as this column is being written, the cries
of rebellious $.A.E. pledges out for blood are heard across

the campus.

Despite the fact that the Colonel was disturbed be-

inci-

cause the crusaders “demoralized” his fighting forces,
most people agreed that Tuesday’s manuever was a suc-
cess. As one professor said when it was suggested that
the peons might be brought before a firing squad, “We've
had peon’s armies for twenty years; this one was just
more successful.” If the old farmer hadn’t needed the
peon general’s steed to plow with, the appearance would
have been grander.

A Queens student, Laura Prince, once had the mis-
fortune to sit toward the back of the Davidson church
during vespers. This poem, read at a joint Davidson-
Queens Sigma Upsilon meeting expresses her impressions:

THE WORSHIPPERS

‘They are writing letters in defiance of the song;
And above the murmurs of the crowd,

I hear the sound of tainted penny thrown in jest,
Collecting laughs from each false face.

The sordid ends of jokes reveal to me

Detested reverence slain by open eyes;

Leaving the prayer unfelt, unheard,

While the lamb flees—vanquished in mirth.”

The most important things that happened “on cam-
pus” this week were the sending of a resolution by the
Y. cabinet and a delegation by the student council to the
Dean. The recommendation by both was that if the ad-
ministration was unwilling to take disciplinary action it
would be better to drop vespers.

COFFEE BREAK

What Manner
Of Banner?

By BOB JONES

‘ Davidson’s interpretation of
the popular slogan “Get rich
quick,” is “Get wise quick,”
While this may be overdrawn,
in light of Dr. Dodge’s remarks
on Wednesday, it may be fruit-

ful to consider just what should
be the aim of a Davidson edu-
cation, which is commonly (and
generously) termed ‘“a_ liberal
education.”

A liberal education in the first
place is not one which gives the
ideal techniques for making a
living. It is orientated to the
present, for the purpose of im-
parting meaning to the whole
of an individual's experience.

The vitimate aim in liberal
education is in the synthesis of
our knowledge and experience.
The major problem of modern

By Schulz

education lies in our educational
pluralism: the unrelatedness of
our special disciplines and the
artificiality of their unifying
ties. Our synthesis must seek
an understanding of an under-
lying unity of meaning.

A maior factor in reaching
any synthesis lies in the exami-
nation of those given to us by
thinkers throughout history. In
the critical evaluation of others
and ourselves, we may, perhaps,
reach a synthesis which gives
meaning to our experience, and
which is worthy of the dedica-

tion of our lives to its princi-
ples. :

Such 2 noble ideal as we have
Set for ourselves will not re-
sult’ from those motivations
Presently dominating our activi-
ties at Davidson. Davidson will
make a difference only when
an atmosphere of inguiry is
created by the interest of
enough people who are con-
vinced that “the unexamined
life is not worth living.”

Then Davidson can proudly
carry the banner “Liberal Edu-
cation,” which at present is but
a wishful symbol.
