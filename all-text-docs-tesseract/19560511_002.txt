Terry's Stay a Boon to Students

At a time of year when bouquet-
tossing is especially in vogue, among
many deserving there stands one man to
whom Davidson owes a special vote of
gratitude.

Will Terry, a 1954 graduate, returned
to Davidson last September to take over
the General Secretaryship of the YMCA.
Next fall he will leave to continue his
ministerial schooling at Union Seminary
in Richmond. .

The service which Will Terry has
rendered to his Alma Mater this year is
hard to-describe in concrete terms. The
flourishing of the YMCA in its crucial
first year of voluntary membership is evi-
dence enough of. his tangible contribu-
tions.

But more vital and lasting, and
naturally more elusive, is the definite im-

pact which his work has had on student
life in the fields connected directly and
indirectly with his college-assigned du-
ties.

Despite his status as a college official,
Will has somehow been accepted as a
student among students. Not long re-
moved from his own Davidson days, he
has been able to thoroughly understand
student problems, gripes and opinions,
and thereby able to elicit the confidence
and comradeship of the entire student
body.

His ability to view Davidson's collec-
tive and individual problems from the
student as well as administrative view-
point, thereby gearing the work of the
YMCA to meet these problems squarely,
has constituted the core of his outstand-
ing contribution to the life of college.

Euphony Attacks Everything in Sight

Monday evening last ‘marked the occa-
sion of the auspicious birth of an under-
taking so great that it had to be called “a
journal of Liberal Opinion.”

Out of the womb of the old lady
known as the Eumanean Literary Society,
amid her labor pains, deemed ‘“‘a Lyric Cry
in the Wilderness,” emerged a struggling,
ten-page bastard named Euphony. News
of the birth of this mimeographed man-
ual of liberal intellectualism spread
quickly over the campus.

Many were the well-wishers who
flocked to the bedside of Eu in the hope
of seeing this offspring for themselves.
The child was carefully studied by many,
and it was welcomed to the campus with
humble optimism, hedonistic optimism,
tragic dptimism, and pessimistic opti-
mism.

Now that Euphony has attained a
healthy age of four days, a critical study
of the Journal finds but few flaws in its
conception.

Consistency might perhaps be the key-
note of Euphony. The first page states
that Euphony is “officially ‘a liberal jour-
nal’,” but that “Euphony is thoroughly
tolerant of opinions other than those of
its own staff and writers.”

As a result, throughout the manual
nothing but the kindest words for that
really pitiable creature, the conservative,
can be found. They are merely described
as “human refuse which litters and in-
fects our so-called academic community.”
Such adjectives and descriptive phrases
as “stupid and psychotic,” “ilk” (what-
ever that means), and ‘“‘cesspools of small-
mindedness” are simply used.

My, how astounding is this “liberal”
toleration!

Euphony is consistent in other ways,
too. When it criticizes, it criticizes. One
thing you can always be sure to find in a
liberal publication is the ability to criti-
cize, and to criticize adversely.

Let's see. It attacks conservatism, page
one; the Davidson liberal arts tradition,
page two; pre-meds, four-course seniors,
and business majors, also page two; math,
science, Bible, English, history, and phi-
losophy courses, page three; the Davidson
gentleman, page four; the fraternity sys-
tem, page five; a whole potful of different
things, page six: segregationalists (please
excuse the use of this anti-intellectual
word), page seven; the poor ole Negro,
page eight; and the whole Davidson sys-
tem, page nine. Wow! Why even the
venerable old bull session comes in for its
share of criticism!

By covering so much in one issue, will
there be anything left to attack in the
next?

One fascinating “tidbit” is found at
the bottom of page eight: “Dissatisfied?
Of course, there’s always P. J. C.” I won-
der if the authors of these mighty articles

have ever themselves considered P. J. C.,
if they are so dissatisfied with D. C.

Despite all the criticism, however, one
cannot help but applaud the attack, in
the article entitled ‘Local Somnambul-
ism”, on those who still believe anything
that is ascribed to by their parents. It is
difficult to imagine that anyone can really
think that their parents’ view, on any sub-
ject, might be the correct one.

Unfortunately, this manual of liberal-
ism can boast but one advertisement.
This single ad on page six points out the
advantages of partaking in Sigma Upsi-
lon, the ‘‘ne plus ultra of campus literary
endeavor.” so the ad says.

The eleven titans of liberalism who
claim the credit as midwives of Euphony
have indeed a right to. be proud of their
offspring.

It is but a question of time before
Euphony will take the place of Life Maga-
zine, The New York Times, and maybe,
with a little luck, even the Intercollegian.
But for Euphony to achieve these suc-
cesses we must all, as the Journal asks,
make Liberalism a household word.

Liberalism, Liberalism, Liberalism,
Liberalism. Ah shucks, think I'll go have
some chocolate pudding! —A.W.F.B.

Escape for
Mired Minds

Every once in a long while, there
comes to Davidson an event which stirs
students and faculty alike to a surge of
united intellectual enthusiasm. and pene-
trating thought and discussion.

Such an event was the delivering of
the {956 Otts Lectures by Dr. George
Buttrick of Harvard Divinity School this
past week. Dr. Buttrick has long been
rated as one of the top preachers in
America today and many feel that he
Stands at the apex of a very select list.

Perhaps the basis of Dr. Buttrick’s
appeal this week lay in the fact that he
not only is a preacher of great note, but
that he is, as one professor put it, a
“sure enough scholar” in the finest sense
of the word.

The consistent gravity of his five-lec-
ture message was a compliment to his
audience. His scholarly approach to
pressing matters of faith was impressive
and convincing; his arguments sound and
logical. But through the weighty treat-
ment of his topics, Dr. Buttrick’s simple
humility and intense belief in what he
was saying never failed to penetrate.

For many, the lectures provided a
stimulating and refreshing escape from
the unthinking, plodding, uninspired
grind in which all too many of us find
ourselves mired down.

REPLY TO LETTER TO TRUSTEES

College’s Southern Snobbery Bad
Enough Without Copying Yankees

Dear Editor:

I write the following few words
in reply to a letter to the College
Trustees on the matter of in-
creased enrollment from Messrs.
Anderson, Conarroe, Miller, and
Robinson.

it does not disturb me that
the academic standards of
Wesleyan, Amherst, or Union
are more exacting than those
of Davidson College, nor does
it disturb me that the stu-
dents who enroll at these
elite liberal arts colleges are
somewhat more superior as
potential scholars than are
our students at Davidson.
What would. disturb me would

be for Davidson to become the
snobbish Southern counter-part of
these so-called best schools and to
admit as matriculants only those
who are of the very best intellect
and of well-to-do, socially promin-
ent parentage.

Indeed, Davidson is already
a snob among Southern edu-
cational institutions, and per-
haps with very litle reason.
Freshman on entering David-
son are so indoctrinated with
tales of the school’s high
academic standing and rigid
standards that they actually
believe these pompous allega-
tions. ..

In the next few years, more
young people will be seeking to
enter our college classrooms than
ever before. Many of them will
be in a position to enter college
as a result of ‘the unparalleled
prosperity realized by their
parents in the years of the New
Deal and World War II.

- -Here is America’s—and
Davidson’s—opportunity to
educate and mold the lives
of additional thousands of
youth into intelligent, effec-
tive citizens, an asset that our
democratic society cannot af-
ford to be without.

Davidson may limit her fresh-
man class to a small group of the
intellectually superior; she may
add to her library until it has
a half million volumes; she may

EXTRA-

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
By Perrin Anderson

Student Government has at:
tempted this year to be a more
active and efficient organization
which has centered primarily in
assuming energetic administrative
and legislative functions in addi-
tion to the judicial function.

Efficiency was increased by
holding regular meetings and by
making active use of the Student
Government office which was
kept open every week-day after-
noon.

Operating for the first time
under the revised constitution
the Council also dealt with
several cases involving infrac-
tions of the Student Body
Regulations.

In its administrative and legis-
lative capacity the Council under-
took various projects which were
of concern to the student body.
Among these were: a petition to
the Trustees with regard to sub-
sidized athletics, securing a pro-
bationary cut in R.0.T.C., ae:

quiring a row of the old “village”
as apartments for married stu-
dents, initiation of a petition to
the Southern Bell Telephone Com-
pany, placing coke machines in

ACROSS THE

PRESIDENT OF THE
STUDENT BODY

Student Body to the chair-
man of the Trustee’s commit-
tee on Buildings and
Grounds.)

Mr, Olin Nisbet, Jr.
Commercial Bank Building
Charlotte, N. C.

Dear Mr. Nisbet,

In anticipation of the May meet-
ing of the Board of Trustees of
Davidson College and of the re-
port which your Special Commit-
tee on Buildings and Grounds
might present concerning Georgia
Dormitory. I feel that it. may be

secure five Ph. D.’s on her faculty
for each five students; and she
may make her academic standards
more and more rigid. If she does
become the paragon of such
academic superciliousness, then I
say that she will have failed the
cause of Southern education.
The big question, of course,
is what does Davidson wish
to turn out as her final pro-
duct? Scholars or pedants or
that mythical flaughingtstock
called the “Davidson gentle-

man?” .

But America has another, a
greater, need for solid citizens
who wiil go back home from col-
lege to be an inspiration to their
communities. Colleges now have
the opportunity to provide Ameri-
ca with that type of leadership
in greater abundance. Whether or
not one’s English teacher was one
of the best scholars or not may
mean much in the academic
world, but it means very little to
the outside world.

OF MOTHER

So lightly on expectant feet
Sped I from her embrace

Into a world of frenzied heat
To enter fortune’s race.

But now, amid the toil and stress,
I think I still can smell

The homemade breads, the crisp starched dress
The fresh clipped rose as well:

And. thro’ the years, I yearn so oft’
For laughter and sweet song,
Which graced her tender voice so soft

Through patient hours and long.

The world may never know this heart,
But she must mark it well,
For love of her is set apart

Within its citadel.

INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL
By Phil Koonce

The greatest problem that the
inter-fraternity council faces each
year is that of selecting the dance
bands that will suit the majority
of the student body. In trying to
accomplish this task for the past
year the IFC ran into many dif-
ficult problems. The council made

.the mistake of believing that the

majority of the students would be
willing to support a top name
band in concert.

Next year's council should
certainly profit from some of
the mistakes made this year.
It would seem certainly profit-
able for the new couneil
to take a poll of the student
body. The counci! needs to
know who the students want
and if they ere willing to
pey for these bends.

Rush week for the past year ran
true to form. As a result of stu-
dents’ recommendations there has
already been one change in next
years rushing regulations.

Hell Week created more dis-
favor from the fraternities
this year than in any recent
year. Since the IFC stands be-
tween the faculty and frater-
nities, recommendations con-
cerning this problem from
any student or groups of stu-
dents would be appreciated.
Thinking back through the year

the IFC recalls no one thing from
which it received more pleasure
than the Barium Springs Christ-
mas party.

There were many other
things which took the after
tion of the IFC this year.
Examples of this are: dorm

JOHN HARMON’S FAREWELL

What to Remember?

Vale, vale, alma mater.

We say goodbye to Davidson but
none of us really know what we're
saying goodbye to, for now we are
still in the womb of our pedagogi-
cal. mother and are not. yet equip-
ped with voices to cry out.

We are told by many however,
that we will cry out and yearn
again for the security of the ma-
trix. It is very likely that they are
right, for we are certain that the
world is cold and cruel (not like
Davidson) and that after we are
in it for a while we will turn sen-
timental, perhaps slurpily so, in
regard to the “good old conserva:
tive days” of the early fiftiés.

Therefore, before we forget
what Davidson really is like, we
had better jot down a few notes
to keep our memories straight.

ends and the blood drive.

Many improvements can be
made and it is hoped that the
new council, which will have the
advantage of three old members,
will profit from all the mistakes
made by the year’s council.

ROTC
By J. B. Pharr

It has been said, on good author-
ity, that a large number of em.
Ployers realize that a good, well
supervised course in military
science gives to students many
attributes which cannot be ac-
quired in any other college
course.

One of the skills acquired
from the military science pro-
gram is definitely that of pre-
paredness for service in our
armed forces.

Undoubtedly one of the experi-
ences which most of us do not re-
ceive enough here at Davidson is
accepting and completing Tespon-
sibilities. The ROTC program as
set up by the present PMS&T at-
tempts to meet this very vital
need.

Practical organization and
administrative procedures, al-
though not emphasized too
much in the basic course,
come in for a good share of
attention in edvanced course.
It Is one thing to be able to
give beck to «a professor
Principals of organization
and edministration of a re-
view or quiz, but quite an.
other story to apply this
learning even on the ele.
mentary basis of a college
ROTC dritl field. .
Bearing, appearance, and ex-

pression of one’s ideas to other
people come in for their propor-
tionate share of attention in the
typical military science program.

Could the key to the value of
the ROTC program, as considered
by the aforementioned employers,
excluding the military aspect, be
that these desirable qualities are

PUBLICATIONS

Like Edna St. Vincent Millay's

publications have this year often
found themselves burning on both
ends.

almost every merchant in Meck-

What should we remember . . .?
What are some of our good old in-
Stitutions that we will revere next
to God when we come back to
speak in Vespers ten years from
now, when we return to interest
the frantic and impressionable
seniors of 1966 with joining our
company, when we bring our prog-
eny back to see “where Dad went
to school.”

One of our incomparable institu
tions which we must boast is that
of the pluperfect pathos exhibited
in the Monday morning faces, for
this is one of the characteristics
of our good old generation. We
must not forget the tradition of
jovial profanity which emanates
between dorms at all. times, nor
must we forget those whose names
have become traditional themselves
through constant shouting, espe-
cially at nights, by those who are
fond of them for their phonetic
beauty and lyrical charm.

As for Davidson’s own contribu-
tion to our great generation we
will remember the few lectures
which we haven't slept through,
the instillment in us all of Chris-
tian devotion to the dollar sign,
the neatly cut grass on the front
lawn, redolent of prosperity, and
the phallic road posts, symbolizing
virility. ‘

Davidson has taught us to be
cautious, sly, and trustworthy but
non-trusting. This we can take with
us,

To the rest of Davidson we say
with tearful triteness, “Farewell,
fond father,” and we know that
to forget will be ungrateful, to re-
member will be unnatural, to be
critical will be unkind, to be kind
will be sentimental, and we are
forgiving but not forgetting, yet
we know that the ultimate. for-
giveness is forgetting. But this is
the time of diamonds and oranges,
“this is the time of tension be-
tween dying and birth.”
