THE TECH GAME

Encouraged by the well earned vic-
tory over A. & M., the Davidson squad
is practicing hard this week in prepara-
tion for the Georgia-Tech. game Sat-
urday. This will probably be the strong-
est team the Red and Black squad will
go up against this vear, and they hope
to make an especially creditable show-
ing. The squad. which will probably
be composed of more men than took the
Virginia trip, will leave Friday night
for Atlanta.
