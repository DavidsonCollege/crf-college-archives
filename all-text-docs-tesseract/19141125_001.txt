Dr. #. L. Smith 0 Occupies Pulpit} Host of Lady Visitors Will Add. ‘Social and Personal Items About

Morning and Evening.

Dr. Henry Louis Smith. President of
Washington and Lee University, and
former President of Davidson, spoke at
both services in the church Sunday.
Alfred Scarborough, President of the
Student Body, extended the invitation
to Dr. Smith. and all the students were
much gratified when it was accepted.
Although the Senior class is the only one
which knew Dr. Smith as president, the
interest with which both addresses were
received proved that the hoid which he
always had on Davidson men did not
end when he left the institution.

The subject of Dr. Smith's morning
address was ‘The Corner Stones of
Marhood.” He very ablv discussed this
subject- under four heads. ‘The first
cornerstone of genuine manhood, which
he named corrags, he dectared was the
very foundation and backbone of man-
hood. He brought out the fact that the
man without courage is a siave to fear
and can never be anvthing but a fathure
in life. He said that a man could culti-
vate courage, and that. he who lacked
courage could hope, in time, to over-
come this and develop into a real and
true man.

Energy or muscles of manhood -wa:
the second cornerstone that ID. Smith
named. He brought out very forcefully
the difference between industr al dili-
gence. as something which is caused by
outside pressure, ani veal eneres, as a
force within the man which drives him
to activity.

Dr. Smith's next point was thar the
very heart of manhood is love. declarine
that it was the only thing in life which
gives hack the highest kind of happines~

The fourth cornerstone of manhoo:
of which Dr. Smith spoke was spirit
ualitv. “This he said was the crown of
manhood. He interpreted spirituality as
that within a man which reaches out-to
God. He placed the crown of manhood
above even love. saving that a oman
mighttive a life of courage. energy, and
love, vet be a complete failure in life.
Because if he was nat drawn to God hy
this force he could never accomplish the
purpose that God had in putting him
into the world.

In the evening Dr. Smith's subject
was the storv. of the Hebrew children
and their refusal to worship the golden
image.in the plain of Dura. He pointed
out the great temptation which con-
fronted them, a choice between a life of
ease and favor in the service of Nebu-
chadnezzar. with a prospect of being
able to deliver their country from ‘its
captivity, and a horrible death in the
fiery furnace. It was the courage based
on a sublime faith which enabled them
to stand out boldly as thev did. This
courage was both physical and moral.
When thev were east inta the furnace
the moment of their greatest sacrifice be-
came the mamens of most intimate fel-
lowship with God. The great lesson for
us is that of faith and courage. based
upon the assurance that ‘one with God
is always a majority. “

After the services several members of
the Senior class called on Dr. Smith at
the home of Dr. Martin, where he was
entertained. It happened that Frant
Price had found one of~Dr. Smith’ s old
Greek notehooks dated 1877 in the old
library. and the sight of it awakened a
train of memories of his days as a stu-
dent here. The striking feature of the

ting climax to the gayeties of Turkey
Day. and te. the termination, also on
that da.. ot a successful toot ball season.
