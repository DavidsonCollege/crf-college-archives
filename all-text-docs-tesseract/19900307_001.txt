Ads stress women as sex ‘objects, powerless

Kilbourne says such campaigns are Killing Us Softly

By SANDRA SMITH

Killing us Softly, a film ad-
dressing the portrayal of
women and sexuality in adver-
tising, and Calling: the Shots, a
film focused primarily on the
alcohol industry and its ad
campaign, were two films by
Jean Kilbourne discussed last
night in the 900 Room. The
event, sponsored “by the
Women’s Concerns Commit-
tee, enjoyed a large audience
and earnest discussion led by
Davidson professors Rose-
marie Tong of the Philosophy
Department and Ed Palmer of

Inside

the Psychology Department.
The films were both humor-

ousand yet serious in revealing
the need to understand propa-
ganda and subtle cultural mes-
sages that we as a society of
consumer encounter. Perhaps
one of the most horrible and
myth-producing media adver-
tisements shown was one that
proclaimed, “Feminine odor is
everybody’s problem.” .

In Killing Us Softly Kilbourne
makes the claim that there is a
relationship between advertis-
ing and a pornographic atti-
tude that exists in our society.

Moreover, she suggests that
the attitude toward women’s
bodies portrayed in ads. is
damaging to both sexes—that
is, the relationship between the
unrealistic notion that ideal
perfection is necessary and
possible, and that this perfec-
tion is 110 Ibs. of soft curves
and supple rosy hips.

Kilbourne states that adver-

tisements tend to encourage
the roles of submission and
passivity for women, andarole
of domineering machismo for
men. She says ads present
people as objects and that they

ae bodies with the

products. So many ads disas-
semble the total body and only
show parts of a chest or a hip,
suggesting only the functionof

"the parts, thereby dehumaniz-
- ing the person belonging tothe

chest orhips.
Kilbourne says this relates to
us because this dehumanizing
agentencourages the myth that
women are permissive and
always sexually available, a
myth she finds insulting to
both genders. Theseadsare not
so obviously harmful shown

independently, but are danger-

ous in an accumulative. and
unconscious manner. _
According to Kilbourne,
these ads create a powerful
sexual image of womenas pas-
sive, powerless and depend-
ent, particularly when child
models are used. They affect
our culture as a whole by creat-
ing desire for a certain type of
woman who is more willing to
please and made up of zero
percent body fat. More tangi-
bly, it trivializes the epic of
