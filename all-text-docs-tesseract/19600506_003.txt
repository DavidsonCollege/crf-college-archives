sure the right of every Davidson student to participate in
intramural athletics. ‘

Inhibition and Practicality . . .

The new ruling does not destroy the student's right
to play. It does greatly inhibit, if not destroy, the stu-
dent's willingness to join or quit a fraternity.

Perhaps this ruling is the most practical solution
to the inactive “problem,” but surely, it is not the fairest.

We urge the new IMAC representatives and presi-
dent Mike Van Doeren to restore the group’s objective
to full strength, and to make rulings accordingly.

Davidson’s baseballers travelled to Blacksburg, Va. | %

today for two games with VPI today and tomorrow. Then

next Friday and Saturday; May 13, and 14, the ’Cats go, :

to The Citadel for two games with the conference leader.

VPI, deseribed by Coach Tom
Stevens as a “very good team,”
was upset twice by Furman last
week. Asked about Davidson’s
chances, Stevens said he didn’t
know, that the team makes too
many mental mistakes.

STARTING PITCHERS

Dee Green is scheduled to
start the first game with either
Graham Showalter or Nick
Daves hurling the second game.

Davidson will close out its
baseball season with next week's
two games with The Citadel.
Citadel, whose only loss this
season was to VMI, was describ-
ed by Coach Stevens as a “good-
hitting team with two real good
hurlers.”

Last Saturday Davidson lost
the first game of a scheduled
double-header with Furman by
6-1 while the second game was
washed out. Dee Green took the
loss.

TWO MORE LOSSES

Then on Thursday of this
week the ’Cats dropped two
games to Pfeiffer College by
scores of 8-2 and 5-1.

Nick Daves started the first
game and took the loss with
Jerry Shelton relieving.

In the second ganie Graham
Showalter pitched the first 5!
innings, giving up three runs,
with Green finishing up. Short-
stop Don Killian was the only
bright spot as the Wildcats
again exhibited their loose de-
fense,

LEADING HITTERS

First - baseman “Thumper”
Harris leads the ‘Cats at the
plate with a .375 average. He is
followed by Ed Hines and Russ
Cotton, batting at .362 and 327,
respectively.

Hines is the best RBI man
for the ‘Cats, while Cotton is
the most improved at the plate.

Coach Stevens said, “We've
been hitting, but not with men
on base, and this is where we
are poor.”

Dee Green, the workhorse of
the pitching staff, has compiled
a 3-5 record. Nick Daves has a
2-2 record, Jerry Shelton's is 1-1,
while Graham Showalter has
won none against two losses. |

“Track is very different

I was in college,” said Davidson’s likable track coach,
Pete Whittle, THE DAVIDSONIAN’S “Wildcat of the

Week.”

Whittle graduated from David-
son in 1930 and is now in his
thirtieth year as track coach
here. In those years, his teams
have compiled an impressive
record of 121 wins, 51 losses,
and 2 ties, in dual meets.

Thinclads Win Relays;
Loop Meet Next Week

Davidson’s hot track team

(5-2) outscored a field of
seven colleges here Satur-
day to take the second an-
nual High Point Relays. The
Relays, which will be re-
christened the Davidson Re-
lays, saw ten of Jast year’s
records broken.

The Wildcats, bound for the
Southern Conference meet next
weekend, compiled 53 1-3 points,
taking a 9 point win over sec-
ond place Roanoke College.

Presbyterian was third with
27 points and Lenoir Rhyne,
High Point, Catawba, and Atlan-
tie Christian rounded out the

field, finishing in that order.

Davidson, led by Laughlin and
Kiser, finished strong in the re-
lays, taking first in the 880-
yard relay and the 440-yard re-
lay.

The 'Cats also dominated the
broad jump and _ hop-step-and-
jump, with Laughlin, Murray,
and Chiles taking second, third,
and fourth in both events. Andy
Boggs and Stuart Nickles had
second places in the discus and
javelin respectively.

High-jumper John Huie failed
to come up to his previous per-
formances, but, along with Tim
Lucas, was part of a 4-way tie
for second place in the pole
vault. Warden took third in the
shot.

Still limping, Gilmour is due for
a check-up to determine the ex-
tent of the injury.

Coach Whittle will take nine-
tcen men to the conference meet
in Williamsburg on May 13-14.

Asked to comment on the out-
come of the meet, he said, “You
can usually tell how these meets
will come out before you start.
Citadel will probably win again
this year, with Furman second.
The rest will fight it out for

Pole-vaulter Henry Pharr ag-lower places.”

30 Years: |

now from what it was when

When Whittle was on the
track team at Davidson, he ran
the 120-yard high hurdles, the
220-yard low hurdles, and the
100-yard dash. In tough meets,
he would also run the 220 and
compete in the broad jump.

He held school records in
both of the hurdles until one
of his pupils, Archie Taylor,
broke them in 1942.

At an indoor meet at West
Virginia, he tied the world’s
record in the 70-yard low
hurdles,

In explaining how track has
changed since his college days,
Whittle pointed out that one of
the major differences is in the| .
new and old methods of train- |
ing. He said that the practice
of much overdistance running!
has been replaced by interval
running, even f¢ér distance men.

“Today, too, there is much
more concentration on form
than there used to be. Also,
there is more interest now in
track than ever before,” the
successful coach added.

The coach is very proud of his
son who is a freshman at UNC
and on a track scholarship.
Heath, Jr. has cleared 13 fect in
the pole vault and should soon
clear 13 feet, 6 inches.

The traditional freshmen cake
race held at the beginning of
each school year was started by
Whittle about 21 years ago.
“Through it, I've found some
real good distance men,” he
said.
