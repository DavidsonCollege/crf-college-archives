Buck Archer's
Hep Cats Are
Solid Senders

Fourteen-Piece Student Or-
chestra Makes Debut on
Campus

By ED SUTTON

Were you on hand in Chambers
last week when Maestro Archie
Archer and his solid fourteen filled
the auditorjum with some stuff that
was strictly in the groove and had
the cats in a trance for almost a
full hour?

As is known by all, Archer is no
musician himself and does not ac-
tuatty tead™the band, but much of
the credit of its organization and
planning go to him. Buck says that
he is a cross between a business
manager and a utility man.
Barnwell and Morgan

“Jumping Joe” Barnwell, who also

In orchestrations, is

plays a lot of drum with the hep
crew. Jim “Goot" Morgan has also
been a faithful worker with the band
and supervises the actual playing
of. the jive and icky. Other mem-
bers of the orchestra include» Ned
Everett,—Stimy~Sanders,—and Bill
Merrit in the sax sectton; George
Bernhardt, Craig Schmic,,
sill Evans playing some Knocked
out trumpet; “Doc” Hollinger and
Foster Phillips.on the trombone,
and Alf McNair, Beverly Bobbit and
Layman Whiddon rounding out the
rhythm section.
Pfohl Advises

Mr. Pfohl of the Davidson Music
Department has been very ‘helpful
to the boys by advising them and
by letting them use some of the
school equipment which the band
Jacked.

Archer says that his will
solid be on the beam ina few more
days as they are-really beginning
to get together-on their work now:
They are planning to give another
concert soon and promise that the
hot licks will be flowing like water
over a cataract.

First. Band

It is certainly. a. strange thing
that’ Davidson's first swing band
should be worked together by a
non-musician, but it seems to be
progressing nicely and “Mother”
Archer, as the boys’ affectionately
call him, is really going all out to
see that his band will.not just buzz
out-like-so-many of the other at-
tempted -orchestras have done. It
the—band—is—not eft—too full of
holes by the calling of the E.R.C. or
by the draft, the students should
have swing for some time to come.
