Out Of Focus

The Washington Post, which
eloquently states ite opinion {o each
member of Congress over the bresk-
fast table every morning, operated on
the Americen Medical Association in
a recent editorial entitled “Last Diteh-
manship."

The pol af the capital press
poignantly sisted that “the AMA has
so consistently been too late with too
littlu that if Ras become hard 10 look
to that organization for any eenstruc-
tive role in dezigning medical insur-
ance programs. The ADA has, ip tur,
ppposed avery siep that has been
taken to impreve access to medical
enre for Anmoricans. of avotage and
belov-aversge incomus it originally
apposed Blue Cros nit Bie Shield:
it opposed the original Kert-Mills leg
islation it new so bravely endorses:
it now omnes up with an “eldercsre
proposal only after it bad become un-
imisizkeally clear thal Congress Js
rendy to poss a huspital care pro-
grain.”

As attacks on the “Tost diteh-
manship” of the AMA, these points
of the Post are valid, However, de-
spite the editorial's ttle, the Past‘s
ultimate object of attack is the AMA's
“Eldercare” program, which has been
submitted as an allornative to the ad-
ministration'’s “Medivare” ptan.

The Washington paper contends
.. The AMA stuck to last ditchman-
ship. and it Is going to be hard ta take
fis latest ‘education’ campaign and iis
latest proposals as anything but fur-
ther reflection af the AMA's lack of
Interest in any aspect of health in-
surance except to keep the role of
Government to a minimom.”

Never does the Post turn its at-
tenting to the "Tidercare” plain itself.
Rather the newspaper—in a shrewdly
oblique fashion—aizeredits the mo-
Hives of ihe measure’s sopansors. Per-
haps the sponsors’ motives deserve
triticism. buat such eritieism should
never replace judgment of the pre-
gram on merit alone.

Thanks, Fellows

Meeting the Citadut’s tenacious
cadets provided a fitting etl to regu-
jar-ceason play far this year's Wtld-
cats, Close scores; the first half, fol-
lowed by second-half surges and
healthy finishes, hive been frequent
enough to proveke ulcers this year,
both withkn and beyond the scrappy
and anpredictable Southern Confer-
ence...

No matter where the tourney
nave ends. one fact remains leaving
the team this year sre men who—un-
der the keen eye of Conch Lefly Drie-
sell—have added a Gauguinish splash
ta the portrait of Davidson. Davidson
is still a “small, church-reluted,
academically strong tiberal-aris cot-
lege for men.” Bul it is more: David-
son Is also a nationally ranked haskel-
ball power.

While adding such a distinction to
jis catalogue of deseriptives, David-
son has also quietly acquired another
laudable asset. School spirit—however
trite that phrase may be—has snug-
gled up to the somewhat rezerved,
then warming embrace of the David-
son student body, Over the past four
years, the vague and intangible quali-

Bright Spot

In considering the question of
where we stand I have found that
there are bright spols, grey spots,
and spots that remain predominately
dark, To speak first of the bright
spots, { think we must all agree that
Some solid progress has been made
in strengthening and improving public
education. Perhaps the first thing to
note on the bright side is a change of
atmosphere; in a great many schools
the intellectual development af youn
people is now cccepted as the
mary asim of schools and no longer
drags bebind cltizenship training,
home and family ving, and the de-
velopment of leisure-time activities.

The bright child is more and
more coming to be considered a na-
tinnoal asset, although in seme circles
brightness is still considered a sort
of affliction, the bright child becam-
ing the “exceptional” child, classed
with such unfortunates as the emotian-
ally distrurbed and mentally back-
ward,

_ ‘The new respect for things of the
mind and for a curriuulum ta match
is reflected in a number of ways.

ies of “sekool spirit’ have become
real and readily perceptble traits in
the student body. The bleachers in
Johnston Gymnaslum are not only
Alled but also exuberant. There now
exists a facet of Davidson in which
ai students take pride; there now ex-
ists 5 facet of Davidson with whicti all
students as a student body identify_

Many should share in the crectit
for the transition. But deserving ape
tial attention ore tis year's seniars—
Hetzel. . ‘Teague. . Davidson - - -
Marean. . . Briggs: . Recruited by
Lefty and elnsely walehed their frrsiv
man year by a victory-hungry ¢oim-
munity, the fledgling ‘(nts came
through their sapbomore year with
an Impressive record thal iticltidad a
stunning upset of then second-ranked
Duke. The seasons since then have
seen no loss success, no less pressure
amitl ever intreasing student pride,

We revel in reflecting on the
Haratio Alger-like climb of Davidson
from the conference doormat. And
acrompanving our reflective delight
is the hope thet we have witnessed
but the first fleeting moments of a
long perio’ of success for Davidson
teams and for Davidson,

Many school people have sought the
help of subject-matter spectalists in
the colleges in an effort to strengthen
the basic subjecis, and in recent years
we have seen the fruitful results of
this covperation. This is notably true
in the sciences and in mathematics,
where committees of specialists, work:
ing with school people, have boen busy
revising and improving the ¢curricu-
om,

That a segment of secondary edu-
cation has improved in recent years
is demonstrated in part by higher col-
lege entrance examination scores and
by reports from deans of odmissinns
who tell us that entering classes are
Steadily improving. But perhaps a
word of caution is in order here; we
do not know whether these higher
suores are atcaompanied by greater
tepresentation among high schoolk

~ Amherst And Greeks

A subcommittee of the Amherst faculty, in a re-
port urging a sweeping renrganization to make the

college a

enuine intellectual community, has rec

ommended that iraternitics be replaced by a system
of residential units, Rach unit would be Jarge enoagh

to develop a full range of

student activities.

These unils, to be known as the Amherst socie-
ties, would combine, an 4 geographical basis, clusters
of existing fraternities and dormitaries. Each would
house between $0 and 130 upper classmen ind would
have a proportional number of non-resident fresh-
men members, thus ending the present policy of
keeping freshmen segregated through their first

year.

In recommending the change, the committee
stressed that its emphasis was not on abolishing fra-
wralties but on (nding a way to give relevance and
unity io student education.

“Our main complaint is that students bave come
to identify significant intealloctual life exclusively
with the classroom performance as measured by
grades," the report said. “They speak of themselves
as divided between their work and (heir social Ilfc.
Many social institutions and extracurricular activi-
ties seem to have diminished in standards of excel-
lence and achievement of self-expression, and these

values are now assigned

to the classroom, if any-

where. As a result, non-academic, intellectual and

creative pursuits dwindle:

the academic ones, in too

Many cases, lack entinistasm and dedication.”

In its early thinking, the committce attempted
to devise within the existing system of fraternities
and dormitories reforms (hat might break down what
member described “as the rigid separaton of thought

and pleasure."

t finally concluded that fraternities at Amherst
have become an anachronism, that possibilities for
their reform have been exhausted, and that th
now stand directly in tie way of exciting new possi

bilities for student life.
