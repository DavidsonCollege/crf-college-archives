Students Fail To Apply For
Money Available For Loans

By GARY STEW ART
Staff Writer

Dean of Studeuts Will Terry
reported that no students have
taken advantage of the student
loan program established by
last vear'’s graduating seniors
as their class gilt to the college.

The purpose of the student
loan is to provide cash on a
short term low interest basis.

The seniors stipulated that
the loan is to be used for
necessities such as books. tui-
tion. reom and beard. unex-
vected trips. medical expenses
and other ligitimate needs

“Legitimate reasons are not
stereo equipment. a big night
out or personal investment”
said Terry. “The loar is on a
stricth legal basis to msure

prompt repayment and the rea-
sms given for borrowing the
money will be held highly confi-
dential. between me and the
student only.”

“The loan is for 90 days with
an interest rate of three percent
ner anu. The maximum which
can be borrowed is $500, —

Terry can grant extensions on
the repayment of the loan of up
leone year, ,

Ralph Peeples. student bedy
president stated that he is
dissappointed about there being
so many restrictions but that
it's still. a good idea.

Presently the — student
loan fund has only $810 but the
senior class has pledged a total
of $12,000 which is to be reached
within five vears.

Parking Fines Are Primarily
For Parking Lot Improvement

By BRUCE CORSER
Staff Writer

Director of the Physical Plant
Grover Meetze and his staff
have effected numerous
changes in the parking facilities

at Davidson this year. Ac-
cording to Mr. Meetze new
areas have created ‘‘ap-
proximately thirty-five ad-

ditional spaces’ benefiting both
students and faculty-staff.

New parking areas include
the Fine Arts parking lot op-
posite Main Street open to
students. faculty-staff. and
Visitors: spaces behind Duke
dorm for students. only:
parking spaces on Patterson
Court for faculty-staff and
visitors only: and spaces bet-
ween Richardson Field and
Jackson Court for faculty-staff
and visitors.

The parking spaces in the
west Belk lot. formerly for
faculty-staff only. are now for
students. and the lot east of
Belk. formerly tor students. is
now tor faculty-staff and
Visitors

Certain new regulations are
also a part of the new parking
system. Director of Alumni Aft-
tars Zack Long. a key man
responsible for the retormed
system. has emphasized that
the rules are “not to harass
people. but to make logic out ot

what could be chaos

For example. parking per-
mits. which must be displayed

for cars and $2.00 for motor-
cycles. The Cashier's office

Lot restrictions are in effect
between the hours of 6 a.m. and
6 p.m . Monday through Satur-
day. A person may park in any
designated area during night
hours or on Sunday.

Students are forbidden to park
on the grass or on yellow lines. A
vehicle shoud be parked bet-

ween two white lines in a
marked area
According to Long. these

rules are the ones most often
violated.

three weeks

The first trattic Court session

in 132 Chambers. The ceurt will

andone of thet woother students

Long stressed that “ans
student with valid excuse will
be given a just hearing.”

Bob Corlew, a former mem-
ber of the Traffic Court and a
member of the SGA.has in-
dicated that over one hundred
tickets have been issued thus
far.

Students will begin issuing
tickets shortly in conjunction
with the campus security
patrolmen. This will be done on
a work-study basis.

Corlew stated that an SGA
resolution passed last year
called for the fines and permit
fees to go primarily to improve
parking. and then to reimburse
the business office. and to a
project aimed at benefitting the
student body. Last year $3.500
was collected which was placed
in the general college fund.

Corlew said, ‘there is an im-
passe between the need for
more parking and the desire to
keep Davidson from being
covered with asphalt.”

“The new system will work if
the students have some regard
for the rules.’ Long said
