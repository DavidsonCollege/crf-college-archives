Professor Resigns
Over Ethics Controversy

By Maggie Lehan - The

University Times, UNCC
CHARLOTTE, NC - A professor
of Judaic studies at the University
of North Carolina-Charlotte re-
signed after it was discovered that
he was secretly holding two full-
time teaching positions attwo dif-
ferent universities while receiv-
ing salaries in the amount of
$146,400.

Tzvee Zahavy, a nationally
known Talmud scholar, was hired
by UNCC last year as a result of a
two-year national search to fill the
Isaac Swift Distinguished Profes-
sorship in Judaic Studies.

UNCC was unaware that at
the same time, the professor was
still holding his previous position
at the University of Minnesota.

AtUNCC beginning in Octo-
ber, Zahavy taught a class titled
“Judaism in the Time of Early
Christianity” for two hours on
Mondays and Wednesdays, then
would fly back to Minnesota,
where he taught two of the same
classes on Thursdays.

The 1,000-mile commute al-
lowed Zahavy to pick up the hefty
salaries from both universities. He
also received an advance of $5,000
from UNEC for moving expenses,
which he never used.

In December, justtwo months
after Zahavy’s arrival, UNCC
Chancellor Jim Woodward asked
Zahavy to resign and requested
that he reimburse the university
$5,000. Zahavy agreed to pay
back the money,
~ “The University of Minnesota
has also requested the-professor’s
resignation.

Higher Enrollment

Expected (CPS)
WASHINGTON - The U.S. De-
partment of Education estimates

that 16.1 million students will be
enrolled in colleges and univer-
sities by 2003, up 14 percent from
14.2 million students in 1991.

The projectionsare included
in the department’s Projections
of Education Statistics to 2003,
which includes estimates on el-
ementary, secondary and
postsecondary education. It is
the first report on educational
statistics that reflects 1990 Cen-
sus population estimates and pro-
jections.

The findings include projec-
tions that high school graduates
will number 2.5 million for the
next two years, which will be the
smallest graduating classes since
1964-65.

By 2003, the number is ex-
pected to rise 20 percent to 3
million. Teacher salaries are ex-
pected to rise 20 percent between
now and 2003, and per student
spending should rise 24 percent,
the report said.

Family Sues

ily of a Florida State University

addition, he has worked on com-
missions for Mecklenburg County
and for the state under Governors
Holshouser and Martin.

Davidson has given history
lessons to students, professional
associations, civic clubs, scout
groups, committees for the county,
and alumni groups. He has pub-
lished many articles on the history
of North and South Carolina in
various journals and has also writ-
ten ten books, most on Tar Heel
subjects. Davidson, a third gen-
eration graduate of the college
whose grandfather was Col. Will-
iam Lee Davidson in the class of
1842, wrote The Generations of
Davidson College in 1955. He
continues to update it about the
family histories of Davidson Col-
lege.

Other awards Davidson has

: received include the Charles A.

Cannon cup for North Carolina
History, Raleigh News &
Observer’s Tar Heel of the Week,
the Preservation Award from the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic
Properties Commission, and the
Alumni Service Award from
Davidson College.

Davidson is a proud preserver
of the ideals of Southern gentility.
He defines Davidson College as “a
way of life based on the things of
the mind, tempered by manners
and morality.” According to
Davidson, it is traditional that
Davidson students respect and up-
hold basic manners and morals that
set the college apart from others.
He said, “We do things a little bit
differently from those schools that
are as good but do not have the
stress on manners and morals like
Davidson.”

bol was chosen for its flyers: The
Lotus flower. This flower, a reli-
gious symbol, grows up out of
muddy river beds, its blossoms
decorating the water’s surface.
Jayasinghe expressed the impor-
tance of South Asia Week ’93 quite
eloquently ashe spoke of the flower
using a metaphor: “Because the
lotus flower represents wisdom it
showsus how wisdom sees through
the murkiness of ignorance.”

Indeed, after February fif-
teenth Davidson students may no
longer innocently profess igno-
rance about South Asia. Thanks to
the Dean Rusk Program this area
of the world is coming to us.
