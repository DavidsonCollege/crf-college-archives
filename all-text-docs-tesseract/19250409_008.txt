THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 9, 1925

INSTALL “Y” CABINET SUNDAY
NIGHT

The installation of the new Y. M. C. A.
Cabinet will take place Easter evening
April 12 in Shearer Hall. Mr. Jackson
will deliver the charge to the new pres-
ident and cabniet. An address by Mr.
Jackson is never disappointing to any-
one, and the Y. M. C. A. is quite for-
tunate in its selection of him as speaker
for the evening.

The new president, Hayden Hollings-
worth, will step into that office of very
high honor which has been so excellently
occupied by Harry Price for the past
year. It is no exaggeration to say that
no more splendid fellow has ever held
down the presidency of the Davidson
Y. M. C. A. than Harry Price. He is all
that he has been written up to be and
more.

The other officers to be installed are,
W. T. Covington as vice-president and
W. A. Christian as secretary. In ad-
dition, the entire new Y cabinet will
step into their new offices.

Special music will be furnished by the
K. K. K. Quartet and it is a certainty
that this ‘feature will be enjoyable by
ull present. Additional music will be
supplied by several young ladies who
will be visitors on the hill at this time,
and Piggy Martin

Dr. (Doc) LaFar, of the class of ’22,
and captain of the football team of this
year, together with W. W. Moore, were
among the alumni members of the

O. D. K., back on the campus for the
initiation feed.

Ministerial Band

Dr. R. H. McIlwaine, a missionary to |
Japan, who is in this country on a fur- |
lough spoke to the Ministerial Band last
Sunday.

His subject was, “Getting the right
perspective of our relations to God.” In}
developing this he first explained its
meaning and*showed how men have been
blessed by getting the right perspective,
and of men’s failures because they
missed it.

He told how this was illustrated in the
lives of Moses and David, and showed |
how they were overthrown in attempts,
about which they lost the right perspec-
tive of God. In concluding his talk he
said “The Word of God will never be
overthrown. Our danger lies in disre-
garding His Word.”

must depend on God, and yield ourselves
to God, for Him to direct and guide us.”

Volunteer Band

The Volunteer Band met in the Y:
gymnasium at 10:15 last Sunday morning.

The band was very“fortunate in hav-
ing Dr. MclIlwain, a missionary to Japan,
to speak to them.

Dr. Mcllwain took his subject from
the twelfth chapter of John. He em-
phasized the fact that total surrender is
the only way to give the best service in
the Lord's Kingdom.

The meeting closed with a hymn and
prayer.

C. E. Training Class

The meeting Sunday was termed a
triangle. There were three leaders, three
songs, and three prayers; the leaders be-
ing: M. A. Steele, R. A. Duke, and J. A.
Ricks.

This special service was scheduled for
Easter, but, anticipating that many of
the fellows would be away from town
Easter, it was moved up to last Sunday.
Duke, Steele, Ricks, Milton, and Currie

gave short talks on: “What does
Jesus mean to us?” “A house not built
with hands,” “The resurrection of
Christ,” and “The resurrection proves
Christ a Saviour, it is a glorious hope,

it a moral, and it creates a bond of fel-
lowship.”

DAVIDSON PLAYERS SCORE

of the interior of the home of Andrew Sprig-
gins, miserly country storekeeper. At this
Stage of the play ,the audience was intro-
duced to the large fist of characters, who
played important parts in the comedy-drama.

Beautifully costumed choruses, and nov-
Ity dances were featured at intervals on the
program; but the chief interest of the per-
formance rested on the rejuvenation of
Grandma Pepper, who started in the play BS)
an antiquated and discouraged old woman.
Becoming suddenly rich on oil stock, the old |
grandmother boarded a ship for Europe and |
spent several months in Paris, where she |
has her face “skinned” and her wrinkles re- |
moved. She returned to America a made- |
over woman—but finally» realized that her
experienced heart was too old for her youth- |
ful body, and satisfied her longing for com-'!
panionship in the love of her childhood ad- |
mirer, Dr. Joy.

The play was staged under the auspices of |
the Davidson Civic League, and was pre-
sented under the direction of Miss Viola |

orchestra rendered a number of pleasing
musical selections during the intermissions.

Library News

The Dark Forest, by Hugh Walpole—
“To say that this book is remarkable
is only to lay hold on a convenient word
evpressive of at least a part of the sen-
sation the story produces. Here is a
book for which many of us have dimly
waited, a book that transcends the outer
facts and reveals the inner significance
of war. THE DARK FOREST is a love
story of unusual beauty as well. Who,
having read it, will forget this book, at
once awful and beautiful? It must be
read, for neither quotation nor descrip-

| tion is capable of giving more than a bare

hint of the nobleness, the intensity of
this work of art so deeply rooted in
realty.’—New York Times.

Woodrow Wilson, The Man, His Time, |
and His Task, by William Allen
White— *

Chis book wilt try to tell the story;

“7

as simply as may be told, of a man,-his |

time, and his task. His partisans have
idealized hig virtues and so have sought |
to create a
Heaven-sent Messiah to redeem a wicked |
world from iniquity. His enemies—alas, |
they have seen his weakness through the |
green and red glasses of envy and hate, |
and a fin

made of him. He was neither god nor

frost of the cloister upon his public man-
her, with an academic respect for facts |
jand a Calvinistic addiction for digesting
the facts into his own God-given truth.
On the surface he was half or two-thirds
Irish and so turned to his friends a gay
,and-lovely face. But the dour Scot, big
and dominant inside him turned to his
adversaries a cold and implacable heart

that transformed even the most amiable |
,Of his opponents into ardent foes with a |

lust for torture.”—From the Introduction. |

Heirs of the Incas, by Carroll K.
Michener—

“In the celebrated domain of the old

Inca empire and the melancholy souve- |

nirs of Inca civilization Mr. Michener
has discovered much of unusual interest.
He tells the story of his travels in this
“cradle of the South American people”

with humor and keen appreciation of the |

beauties of the Andean Country, the
strange types of people, and the extra-
ordinary combination of modern com-
mercialism, mediaeval ideas, and general
slovenliness that flourish there.”

Among the foreign books which have
been added to the library are the fol-

The regular meeting of the PnilantHeopies
Society was held April 2. There was noth- |
ing of importance that came before the so- |
ciety. The impromptu debate was not held, |
but the regular “one was, the subject being |
| Resolved, That the disputes between capital
and labor should be sttled by compulsory ar- |
| bitration. All four of the speeches showed |
| that the men knew their subject well and that |
| they had put considerable time in prepara- |
|tion. The decision of the committe was 2 to}
'1 in favor of the affirmative.
| After the result of the debate was an-
| nounced the treasurer made his report, which
; was very pleasing to all members present.
He reported that the note which has been |
| hanging over the society has been paid, and
‘that the annual interest of the $500 endow- ,
{ment of the society has been paid into the
jtreasury. In concluding his report he said
| that the society, besides being entirely free
of debt, had a neat sum in its treasury.
