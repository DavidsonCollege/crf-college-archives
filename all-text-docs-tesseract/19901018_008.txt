Am I Prepared for War?

By Cincinnatus

ROTC aims to develop its
cadets into effective leaders. Being
an ROTC cadet in the present day,
the foremost question in my mind
is, “To where will I be asked to
lead?” Inlightof recent events, “to
war” seems a realistic response.
The current Middle East crisis
concerns all of us at Davidson.

As an ROTC cadet, thoughts
of an impending war weigh all the
more on my mind. When I first
chose to participate in the ROTC
program at Davidson our govern-
ment leaders were forecasting cuts
in military spending in response to
Perestroika and the welcomed
thawing of the Cold War. Notlong
after we had begun to deflate the
“military balloon,” a certain Sad-
dam Hussein startled our leaders

into blowing air into the balloon

once again,
If I were somcone else I might
be terribly excited by the prospect

I’mscared of having to
lead people into a situ-
ation I don’t fully un-
derstand or even wholly
agree with.

of going to war. I might grab my
gun and my men and scream
“Finally! We get to fight!”

The simple fact is, and I think
I speak for many other cadets at
Davidson, I don’t want war. I’m
scared of having to lead people
into a situation I don’t fully under-
stand or even wholly agree with.

Much due to the type education
Ihave receivedat Davidson, I bring
alotinto question that I would oth-
erwise overlook. I’ve Icarned to
think before I act, and have come
to value aconsistency between my
beliefs and my actions. | fear the
day when] am asked to act, despite
my beliefs. I don’t doubt my deci- »
sion to join ROTC. My participa-
tion, I trust, does not add_ to the
senument for war, and perhaps may
positively influence future condi-
tions as my position in the Army
changes.

All said, my enthusiasm for
the program is as strong as

ever...bul so is my insistence not’

to be shoved into a corner and
classified “Militarily Motivated:
Eager for War.” I see what’s going
on with: more sensitivity than
that...and perhaps worry more than
you.

Free Speech Threatened by Rise
of Campus Racism

ment principles, they also threaten
to undercut the achievement of
equal rights. Civil rights activists
have always relied on speech as
their principle weapon. In the long
run, any compromise of principles
of free speech works to the detri-
ment of minorities.

In addition to infringing on
free speech, these codes may actu-
ally fuel racism. As the recent
incident with the music group 2
Live Crew dramatically demon-
strates, allempts to censor offen-
sive Views makes martyrs out of
the censored. Did the censoring of
the album, “As Nasty As They
Wanna Be” silcncc the misogynist

lyrics of 2 Live Crew? Definitely
not. It showered the band in pub-
licity, thereby propelling them to
the top of the charts.

Alan Keyés, a former assistant
secretary of state, points that the
codes themselves arise out of a
racist and condescending reason-
ing.

In a debate with the professor
who wrote the code adopted by
Stanford University this spring, Mr.
Keyes argucd against the “patron-
izing paternalistic assumptions”
upon which the code is founded.

He expressed surprise that
“someone would actually think that
] will actually sit in a chair and be
told that white folks have the moral
character to shrug off insults and I
do not.”

Racism is a problem which
must be addressed with more than
misguided measures like limiting
offensive speech. Notonly are such
measures open to abuse, they also
drive underground where itthrives.

An academic environment
characterized by an unfett
pursuit of truth and knowledge
should be the ideal forum to ex-

pose and defeat the ignorance that bo

fuels racism.

The ACLU’s John Powell
forcefully argues, “The primary
problem is that we haven’t begun
to scriously discuss racial issues.”
He is absolutely right. But the
speech-restricting policies he
seems toadvocate will only havea
chilling effect on the needed dis-
cussion.

Rose, a Broken and Hated Man

Continued from Page 7

You know this type. If you
liked him, or were one of his side-
kicks, read on, I savor the opportu-
nity to insult your kind; if you
know him as the weasel you al-
ways dreamed would grow up to
repeat the phrase “may I take your
order please?” several hundred
times a day, then you are more like
me.

Now, we, the unathletically in-
clined, banished in gymclass base-
ball to deep right field by the ruf-
fian who took whatever the hell
position he wanted to, have our
little slice 0’ poetic justice which
makes life so very bittersweet.

After years of watching this type
ofcretin worshipped by society for
his feigned congeniality towards
the phys. ed. department and “play-

shown that fairness exists.

I really don’t, as if you couldn’t
tell, have even an ounce of pity for
Pete. This guy actually sold his
autograph! Imagine the scene,
“Sure kid, you-can have my auto-
graph, FOR FIFTEEN BUCKS!!!”
Utter slime. Here is a man who
prostituted both his supposcd love
for baseball and his ability to play
the game and in doing so, became
a national hero.

As long as he kissed the right
butts, like his fans (and his book-
ies), Rose could do no wrong.
Behind the scenes we have a man
who, in truth, fixed games as
manager of the Reds in order to
pick up a little cash on the side
(more like a lot), and then had the
nerve to claim he suffers from a
gambling addiction once he got
caught. (Pete, didn’t it occur to

ing his heart out”, we are finally

you that if youn re fixing the game,

there’s not that much of a gam-
bler’s high involved?)

~ It’sreally too bad that the only —

casino rush Pete’s feeling now is
that derived from the drawing of
straws between cellmates in order
to decide which one has to dress up
and play the role of the voluptuous
slut on Saturday night.

Well, Pete, your time has come
and gone. We’re not going to let
you and your people wield your’
bats like scepters any longer. You
see, while weasels like you hold
power on ballfields and in bath-
rooms, it’s our kind, the kind that
like sports for the release they
provide and who admire honest
and decent athletes who play for
thatreason, that keeps it in the long
run. We become the lawyers, the
judges, and even the commission-
ers of baseball, like Bart Giamatti,
who put you in your place.

I propose that we continue
riding the furor of the Great Tow-

change the minds of the adultswho
say we don’t have a social con-
science worth talking about. Let’s
get controversial.
