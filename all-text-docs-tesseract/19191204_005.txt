sing.

Poss Dunlap wonders why his girl

99 minus 4 equals Name in Bulletin.

85 equals 10 days more.

85 minus 7 equals Stay here.

THE FUNCTION OF THE
MINISTER.

The Century Magazine has a’ recent
timely editorial on “The Clergy in the
Wrong Box.” Adverting to the fact
that emphasis in religion is at present
on the side of philanthropic causes, the
Century truly says that “these things
are excellent but they are not the prop-
er business of the clergy.” Ministers
ought to be occupied with. their special-
ty. And the function of the minister is
to do things which belong to his splen-
did profession. “He is to study and to
pray; he is to lead the worship of the
people: he is to preach: he is to zo about
on errands of ministery to the sick and
sorrowful and sinful, In the midst of a
generation occupied with things mater-
ial he is to uphold ideals and to repre-
sent the supreme importance of religion.
There are plenty of people to lecture an
sociology and to organize philanthropy.
Fhe minister’s specialty demands all
his time and thought. He is to save
our souls by building up character that
shall be buttressed in principal.”

—The “minister's son” dwes not
seem to be exactly a scientific subject,
and yet that decidedly technical mag-
azine, The Popular Science Monthly,
deemed him a theme worth devoting
four pages to ‘in one of its recent num-
bers. A Presbyterian pastor at Pater-
son, New Jersey, himself a good illus-
tration of his own thesis, Rev. Clar-
ence Edward Macartney, brings out
the interesting fact that one-twelth of
the namés in “Who's Who”—which
seems to be the standard “hall of fame”
for living Americans of prominence—
are the names of preachers’ children.
And this, he says, is twenty times the
number that would be recognized there
of ministers’ boys ran only side by side
with the sons of other people in the race
for achievement in the world. Mr.
Macartney calculates that 30,000,000
people have come to existence in the
world who would not have lived if the
Reformation had not made it honorable
for Christian ministers to marry. And
he wants to know if anybody can esti-
mate how much good the world would
have lost if these 30,000,000 children
had not grown up in ministers’ homes
in the last 400 years,

BELGIAN PRINCE SALUTES

Greetings for the Boy Scouts of
America were conveyed in a letter to
Scout headquarters by Prince Leopold
of Belgium during his visit to this coun-
try. Part of the message, addressed to
James E. West, chief Scout executive,
runs as follows: “I am pleased to have
an opportunity of conveying to you the
expression of the brotherly feelings of
the Boy Scouts of Belgium to the Boy
Scouts of America, and to express to
you my best wishes for the prosperity
of your great orgamization. Prince
Leopold and. his brother are Belblan
Scouts.—Continent.

Football Men Awarded Letters

Thirteen “D’s” Given to Men of
This Year’s Team |
|

The intermission between the two
parts of the Glee Club concert Satur-
day night was not an intermission after
all. Football honors for the 1919
season were awarded. Here at David-
son the highest honor in athletics is
that of being a “D” man. “D. C.” is
the next highesc honor, There is no
ser standard which © man must attain
Sefore the “D” or “D. C." is awarded,
but as a usual thing only one or two
men other than those in the regular ;
iine-up are awarded a “D." “D. C's”
are awarded those men who show:
ability bur yet do not quite reach the
high standard of the “D’’ men. Some-
times it happens that men who really
deserve “D. C’s” are not given them;
chis is done in order that they might
gain valuable experience by playing
class foo.ball. These honors are award-
ed by the coach and former “D” men,
by and with consene and‘ advice of the
Executive Committee of the Aahletic
Association. For cach year after the
first in which the recipient wins a “D"
a star is awarded. ;

Dr. James Douglas, an old “D" man’
awarded the honors in behalf of the
Athletic . Association Dr. Douglas
awarded “D's” to: J. M. Black ‘20
(three stars), J. C. McMaster ‘20
(two stars), H. MM. Spann '20 (two
stars), W. 1, Johnson '22 (one star),
§. R. Brady .’20 (one star), L. L. Me-
Allister '20 (one star), D. P. Douglas '
‘20 (one star), F. M. Cassell ‘23, L..
O. Hammett '21, D. R. LaFar '22, B..
W. Romefelt '22, 8. M. Davis '23 and
W. F. Hall '20 (manager’s ‘“D").
“PD, C's." were awarded ro: DG
Shaw ‘22, H. P. Murray ‘21, J. M.
McFadden ‘22, C. W. Worth ‘20, L.
W. Dick '22 and W. S. Shepard ‘23. ;

J. M. Blacx ‘20 has a “D" with:
three stars, four years of Varsity ball. !
This is a record seldom made at any
‘allege. At Davidson the best mem-
aries can recall only one man with a
record to equal Black’s. Everett Booe
"12. Black has been a tower of strength
in the Davidson line-up for four seasons
and will ‘be sorely missed. AIcMaster
‘20 and Spann ‘20 ran him a close race
with two stars cach, When .Davidson
loses McMaster she loses ‘one of the
best tackles that ever wore the Red and
Black. Spann our quarter-captain and
Johnson captain for the 1920 season
will have to hustle to beat Henry.

Cassell and Davis did a rather un-
usual thing as they won a “D” in their
Fresh year. If they keep up the pace
that they have set. for themselves - in
1923 they will equal the record of
Black. For the next four seasons
Davidson looks to these two to do grea
things. ; '

«Boys we congratulate you, and wish
you success in life or a “star” next
year,

THE SHORTER BIBLE.

Professor Kent. of Yale, whose sym-
pathy with German destructive crit-
icism is well known, has produced a
shorter Bible, assisted by collaborators
from the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C.,
A. This book cuts out a great part of
phrases of many passages. A resolution
was introduced into the Assembly pro-:

testing against this .frecdom with the’.

Scriptures, and instructing the Board
of Publication not to sell it or display
it on its tables. After hot discussion,
this was amended so as to refer the mat-
ter to the Board of Education, with in-
struction to discontinue its sale if found
harmful.

This is a serious matter. If the
church is to encourage the mutilation of
phe Scriptures. she certainly fights '
against herself and her commission. ;
The board is in no position to determine :
the hurtfulness of such a work. That
is done after the book is sold, and far,
beyond their knowledge. The board '
will do well to take warning from this
resolution against which many in the |
Assembly expressed  dissent.—-Presby-
terian, .

With all our meatless, wheat, and
sweetless day, we are yet not so badly off
as was Lewis Carroll's charming heroine
in Wonderland. .
“Well. then,” said Alice, "II have!

jam teday.”

“Tam yesterday and jam tomorrow,”
said the Queen, “but never jam today.” ’
