The Truth ¢ Comes Out:
Why Davidson is So Difficult

Due to the enormous number
of morally-opposed students in
next year’s incoming freshman
class, Davidson College has made
the decision to make every resi-

dence hall substance-free.

The popular drinking game “Beer
Pong” will be replaced with a
school-sanctioned alternative,

“Birdwatching While Listening to

Kidz Bop.” ,

In admissions essays, over
475 of the 500 applicants chose

‘to explain why they needed a

substance-free hall—they wanted
to be able to do their homework,
get eight hours of sleep a night and
four A+’s a semester, and eventu-
ally graduate with honors and take
a well-paying job in the real world.
They will not be bothered with the
trivialities of Patterson Court or
the senior apartments.

College president Tom Ross is
pleased with the decision.

“There is no doubt in my mind
that the only reason Davidson
College has acquired a formidable
reputation as a ‘difficult’ school is
that its students spend over three-
quarters of their time partying and
not studying. The relatively low

or the senior

cumulative GPA of the college

is not, despite popular belief, a
result of tough grading and strict
professors, but of alcohol-dazed
attendees who ignore their school-
work,” he stated firmly last week.
“The class of 2013, unlike any of
its predecessors, has its priorities
straight. In order for these young
people to succeed, every hall will
be converted to substance-free, so
that they may have the peace and
quiet they deserve.”

Other measures taken recently
include converting court parties
to study sessions, and beer pong
tables have been confiscated and
moved to the library.

THE DaviDSONIAN

ean Investigates “Phantom
Farter” in 1:30 Class

Chambers — Andrew Buckle-
burr, a husky 18-year old fresh-
man, is not going to take it any
longer.

“T’m sick and tired of it!”
Buckleburr exclaimed. “Everyone
thinks it’s me, but there’s just no
way! I know when I break wind
and this definitely has the smell of
a cover-up.”

Buckleburr is blamed for most
flatulence in his 1:30 History of .
the Women’s Rights Movement
class. This session is plagued by
noxious fumes that bring even the
most senior professor to his knees.

“What’s unusual about this
aggressor is that he gives no warn-
ing,” Dr. Mort Finklestein said.
“If anything, I feel a slight breeze

before my eyes begin to water. I
always assumed it was Buckleburr
because he’s the fat kid. Now I’m
not so sure.”

In an effort to clear his good
name, Buckleburr is taking nu-
merous steps to find the real per-
petrator. He has begun taking air
samples during especially ripe epi-
sodes and has even approached his
classmates about obtaining odor

Residence Life Office Responds to Economic Crisis;
New Themed, Off-Campus Housing Finalized

‘ Davidson—RLO has just an-
nounced an exciting addition to
student housing next year. Next
year on Main St. a spacious 40,000
square foot mansion will be open
to 20 students who display an ap-
propriate attitude towards the
theme. The theme is simple: spend
to excess.

“Our hope is that the Davidson
College community can really help
our nation’s GNP. By wasting elec-
tricity, food, water, and gasoline we
should hopefully spur on the sag-
ging oil and utilities industries,”
RLO Director Angelina Murphy
said in a press release.

The goal of the “EconHouse”

hopes of affecting the real estate

not abandon Davidson’s social
life. “Our Carbon Footprint party
is going to dominate Duke Water
& Power,” Chester Covington ’10
said. “We want to stay consistent
with Davidson’s official, wasteful
policy prohibiting the economi-
cally and environmentally-friendly
keg. In fact, we’re going to make
guests pour their drinks from bot-
tles or cans into cups, doubling the
irreversible damage inflicted upon
Mother Earth.”

The EconHouse is actually lo-

cated next to the Ecohouse, and a
budding rivalry has already started. :
“For every sprout they eat, I will
fire up my X-box in my gas-pow-
ered golf cart while grilling five t-
bone steaks. It’s not about me, it’s
about the community and caring,”
Junior Math major A.J. Fields said.
The EconHouse hopes to waste

the EcoHouse saves. The 2009-
2010 school year should be very
exciting for both houses.

Buckleburr has no definitive
evidence as of yet but he has a
hunch. 95-pound Charlotte Digby,
a freshman cross-country and track
runner, has a “certain smugness”
that Buckleburr interprets as guilt.
Buckleburr hopes his study will
stop the embarrassing accusa-
tions, but much work remains to
be done.
