HONORARY FRATERNITY SERIES:

ODK President Calls For

No honorary fraternity at David-

quite as unique and at the same
time ambiguous in the life of the
college community as Omicron Del-
ta Kappa.

It is unique because it recog-
nizes not distinction in a specific

i field, but distinction itself: leader-

activity. But it is ambiguous be-

cause once the recognition is ac-
complished and the Circle mem-
bership formed for the year, there
is nothing to indicate what ODK as
a group of select men ought to do.

No one expects Phi Beta Kappa
to do anything other than perpet-
vate itself—it is a pure honorary.

This ideal of self-determination | end of the year in the quiet evi-

is both good and bad. It is good be-
cause it means there is no accept-
ence of an activity-rut without
thinking; ODK knows nothing of
that spirit that does things be-
cause “this is what has been done
before—amen,” which characterizes
too much of our life at Davidson.
But it is also bad, because it pre-
vents us from learning from the
insights of those who have gone
before, and using them to begin
our thinking. Instead we always
start from scratch.

The solution is a mean between
these two results, and we. might
describe that solution as a contin-
uity of insight but not of activity,
a sense of responsibility but not
of specific responsibilities. It was
an awareness of this principle
which led ODK this year to turn
down the offer of ‘the IFC to
handle the rooms for dance dates.

Sees Film on

The regular February meeting of the International Rela-
tions Club was held Wednesday evening. February 1, at 8:15
P. M., in the Green Room of the College Union.

Following a brief business meet-
ing. Jack Kerr introduced the eve-
ning's program by summarizing a
widely circulated 1947 magazine
article written by the Honorable
George F. Kennan, for several
years United States ambassador to
Russia, entitled “The Sources of
Soviet Conduct.” This article was
received at that time with much
the same furor that has accom-
panied the Dulles and Benson ar-
ticles of recent days.

Mr. Kennan holds that Soviet
power today is not only the product
of inherited ideology, but it is
also’ the product of circumstances.
The USSR along with England and
the United States, was among the
viestorious nations of the Second
World War.

Now that the Soviet power has
expanded the Kremlin finds it
necessary to continue a dictator-
ship to make absolute those powers
which it seized in the revolution
of 1917. Since the Communist man-
ifesto didn't call for a dictatorship
the Kremlin justifies its contin-
uance by attributing its necessity
to the “menace of capitalism
abroad.” Then Stalin declared that
as long as there is a capitalist en-
circlement there will be danger of
intervention and the organs of sup-
pression — the Red Army, MVD
are necessary. Since the quest for
absolute power has not been a com-
plete success, Mr. Kennan believes
that this quest has produced in-
ternally its own reactions,

To combat such a@ power, Mr.
Kennan proposes thet the United
States should formulate a policy
directed at the gradual mellowing
of Soviet power. Since the Soviets
are in no hurry to reach their
goal, such a policy should be one
of a long-term neture — a policy
of containment: hold the line
where it is and apply counter force
on those places which sre con-
stantly shifting geographical and
political points. Mr. Kennan feels
that Russie will continue her pres-
ent goal within the framework of
her ideology.

Soon after the appearance of Mr.
Kennan’s article “The Sources of
Soviet Conduct,” Mr. Walter Lipp-
man wrote “Cold War” which is a
critique of Mr. Kennan’s article.

Mr. Lippman doesn’t think Mr.
Kennan is wise in proposing a
foreign policy directed at the grad-

ual mellowing of Soviet power, for
we actually don’t have any con-
crete evidence that the Soviet
power is decaying. A policy based
on the assumption that a power is
inheritently weak and imperma-
nent is not only the easiest way
out, but it is also murderous.

He then proposes that the U. S.
and Russia should work from the
provisional boundaries which are
defined by the Yalta agreement.
Qnly if the USSR is withdrawn
from the Yalta line into the fron-
tier of Russia and the United States
and Great Britain withdrawn from
the Continent can peace be main-
tained. Such a move would allow
Russia and West Europe to be
separated by small neutral powers,
which would act as a buffer zone,
thereby, making aggression easily
detected if either side moves.

The analysis of Mr. Lippmann’s
article concluded Mr. Kerr's: pres-
entation.

After a period of discussion
among the members, a recent mo-
vie featuring Mr. Kennon in a
forum presentation was viewed.
This enabled the audience to note
the changes which had taken place
in Mr. Kennan’s thought after sev-
eral years.

dence of what they have accom.
plished and, perhaps even more
significantly, in what they have
attempted. ,

In some of the controversial is-
sues that touch the college com.
munity, no one dares approach
with the ideal of accomplishment,
but only of analysis, clarification,
and preparation for the future time
when accomplishment is a possible
goal.

But there is a definition that I
would offer, a private definition
of what ODK ought to be, and one
to which I must frankly admit that
not all the members of ODK this
year, or perhaps any year, would
subscribe. But it is one I feel
strongly about, that I wish might
become one of the continuing in-
sights of ODK that we were talking
about previously. It involves a fun-
damental recognition by the men
in ‘ODK of who they are. For ODK
is a singular body of men when
you consider it. They are not
elected from the student body, but
they are perhaps a more represen-
tative group of students than the
Student Council.

Because of the position each in-
dividual holds in his own sphere of
activity, no group of men = can
speak with more prestige and a
better chance of a significant hear-
ing than ODK on the crucial prob-
lems of the College. But ODK sel-
dom speaks. ODK is composed of
men selected for leadership, but
the Circle seldom exercises its
leadership as a group for the benc-
fit of Davidson in a prophetic way.
Why is this?

The answer "iss gartly in the
great image of the Davidson gen-
tleman that hangs over us all.
There is a strong tradition at Da
vidson that nobody ever must step
on anybody’s toes, even when there
is a reasonable certainty that “any-
body” is wrong. Perhaps this tra-
dition restrains us. Perhaps we are
just shy.

Whatever the reason, all of Da-
vidson suffers because all of Da-
vidson is considerate to the point
of impotence, and ODK might shed
a little of this considerateness in
taking an occasional stand on im-
portant issues. Somewhere we have
lost that part of the tradition of
the gentleman unafraid. And my
wish is that the ODK Circle might
resurrect it and take on something
of the character of a prophet. It
could be a prophet with honor in
its own country. That country is
sorely lacking in prophets.

Philanthropic Society
Installs President

Monday evening, February 6,
marked the beginning of a new
and noble administration of the
Philanthropic Literary Society. In
the time-honored ceremony of the
1800’s, under the Napoleonic chan-
delier, Mr. Kerry Edwards Spiers
was installed as president of the
society by Mr. Richard Morehead,
retiring president. °

Mr. Spiers then delivered his in-
augural address in which he re-
stated the original aims and pur-
poses on whieh the Society - was
founded. He condemned subter-
fuge in any form and encouraged
the members to hold fast to their
high ideals of honor and integrity.

It was noted by Mr. Spiers that
though many years have passed the
excellent qualities of literary skill
which made Phi great still live in
the present membership.

The program presented to the
Society was an original drama of
excellent quality written by Mr.
Jack Trawick. Unforeseen events
preventing the presence of Mr.
Trawick, the play was offered by
Mr. Harry Antrim, retiring vice-
president.

New York, N. Y.—(LP.)—Voluntary gifts and grants estimated at
$507,000,000 were received by the nation’s colleges and universities
during the fiscal year 1954-55,

This is compared to approximate-
ly $339,000,000 in 1951-52, accord-
ing to a survey conducted by the

cation. The total falls short by
some $100,000,000 of the estimated
annual need for the; next ten
years, Dr Wilson Compton, presi-
dent of the Council. pointed out.

The average amount of voluntary
support. received by the 728 four.
year, degree-granting institutions
surveyed for all purposes and from
all sources was $479,531. The high-
est group average, $896.031. was
for 178 private colleges and univer-
sities. The next highest average
was $457,000, for 149 tax-supported
institutions. The group of 141 Cath-
olic institutions had an average of
and 233 Protestant
church-related and church-con-
trolled colleges and universities
has the lowest average, $286,439.
(A total of 701 questionnaires were
completed, but two represented
more than one institution cach.)

A group of 132 Catholic colleges
received 50 per cent of their vol-
untary support from religious de-

nominations, a large part of it in
the “contributed services” of the
clergy. Another group of 229 Prot-
estant church-related colleges re-
ceived 36 per cent of their volun-
tary support from churches and de-
nominational boards. The 132 Cath-
olic colleges and nine Catholic uni-
versities received an average of
eight per cent of their total in gifts
from business concerns, as against
12 per cent for the entire 728 insti-
tutions

Financial support from business
concerns totaled $39,432,625. If al-
lowance were made for income
from contract research grants (ex-
chided from the survey) and for
grants to two-year colleges and
specialized schools, the projected
total for all colleges would be
more than $80.000,000. Some ob-
servers, Dr. Compton said, have
estimated it at as much as $100,-
000,000. The total for 1950, as esti-
mated by the Commission on Fi-
nancing Higher Education, was

With the concluding numbers by
Rossini, the orchestra moved into

to the true nature of the orches-

Now, we all know (or should)
that good hurdy-gurdies are charm-
