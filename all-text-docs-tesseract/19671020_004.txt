THERE ARE NO BAD TEACHERS ;
THERE ARE ONLY BAD STUDENTS

The academic year has only just begun and already
one thing is clear: you're not ready for college.

What, then, should you do? Should you throw up your
hands and quit? I say no! I say you munt attack’ grapple,
cope! I any Amorica did nat become the world's leader in
motel construction and kidney transplants by running

Nh the question then: You say you're not ready for col-
lere. You're too green, too naive. You inck maturity.

Okay, the unower is simple: get mature. How? Well
Bir, to achieve maturity you need two things:

a) a probing mind;

b) 2 vest.

A probing mind will be quickly yours if you'll remam-
ber that cducntion consists not of answers but of ques.
tions, Blindly accepting information and dumbly
memorizing data is high school stuff. In college you don
juné aceept. You dispute, you push, you pry, you chal-
lenge. If, for instance, your physics prof anys, “FE equels
me squared,” don't fust write it down. Bay to the prof,

This will show him two things:

a) Your mind is a keon. thrusting instrument,

b) You are in the wrong major.
