Mens’ ‘Tennis
gains momentum

By WHIT WILKS
The men’s tennis team con-
tiued its winning ways this past
week in running the season record
to 14-6. On Friday, Coach
Frank’s crew laid one on those

who are used to being indoors on
days suchas this one. Due to a
scheduling conflict which saw tne
women’s team at home as well, the

through 12th seeds, but the vic-
tory was impressive nonetheless.
The next day, the Cats proved that
A.C.C. schools can be beaten, as
they won a tight 6-3 match over
N.C. State. The Wolfpack, laden
with foreign talent, was humbled
in what Coach Frank described as
a tremendous win. Davidson took
4 of 6 singles and 2 of 3 doubles in
the match. On Monday, the win-
ning only continued in a 9-0 drub-
bing of Belmont-Abbey. The Cats
clearly were in a different class
than “The Abbey” on this day.

’ Tuesday, the team played
another A.C.C. competitor as
they hooked,up with the U.N.C.
Tar Heels. Cold, windy condi-

got to play inside because Raleigh
(home of Peace College, the
women’s opponent) is farther than
Chapel Hill.” Frank noted that it
would have been nice to play the

given the Cats outstanding recent
performances. However, the Cats
succumbed to conditions and the
superior Tar Heels, arOEP Ine the
match 8-1.

The team defeated U.N.C.C.
on Wednesday 5-4 despite losing
4 of 6 singles matches and is set to
begin conference play next week.

_ two weeks will go a long way in

determining the Cats conference
