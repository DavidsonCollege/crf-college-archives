The Question: Which
Is The Real Walker? |

“Bzzzzzt!” A light flashes on, a question is calmly
answered, watching millions sigh with admiration, and
another facet—the Quiz Kid—of the manifold personali-

u. Ss. NAVY

The military stepped into the
picture about then and two
draft boards called him at the
same time. Dr. Fredericksen
. said that he was registered with
one board in New Jersey dnd
' another in Virginia. “Neither
one knew what the other was
doing,” he said. With cight
years of college behind him, the
Navy made him an Apprentice
‘Seaman. His application for a
commission was soon processed,
and he was sent to Princeton
to join the ranks of other “80
day wonders.”

Pe

“Princeton was 8 sort of
vacation after boot camp,”
Dr. Fredericksen said with a
grin. “They taught us a little
bit of everything there. Just
to tell us what the Navy was
about.” With another smile
on his face, Or. Fredericksen
went on to tell about his as-
signment.

ty of Laurens (‘“‘Wad") Walker is revealed.

The other facets are well
known here at Davidson: the
military man (‘Just when was
the last time you did get a hair-
cut?"), the campus leader (‘Let
me buy you a cup. of coffee"),
the scholar (Damn! Just a 3.0
this semester”).

The question may arise:
Which is the “real” Watker?
And the answer is: None of
these. For the essential
Laurentian character express-
es itself away from the pub-
lic eye, among the untrodden
ways, and it takes the form
not of the Leader or the
Scholar or the Quiz Kid, but
of the Editor.

Whether gently snarling at
associates (“You can't say that
in an editorial; they'd throw us
both out of school”), creating
an editorial (‘You spell it
‘principal’ don’t you—or is it
‘principle’?”), or dealing with

_ the mighty (‘Now President
Martin, we certainly didn’t
* mean to imply that”), Wad is
most in his natural element
when getting out a paper.

This year the LAVIDSONIAN
was stamped with the WLW
trade mark. It was the concrete

Luncheon To Fete
Press Executives

Key executives of television,
radio, and the press will be on
campus Monday for a luncheon
and conference with Dr. Mar-
tin. The meeting will primarily
concern publicity of the April
22 inauguration of the presi-
dent.

Mr. James J. Harris of Char-
lotte, the chairman of the
Board of Visitors, invited the
guests to Davidson. They will
attend the informal luncheon

at 12:15 in the ballroom of the .

Union.

At this time, Mr. Harris will
extend a note of appreciation
from the college for the cov-
erage already given the inaugu-
ration. The guests will also
have an opportunity to ask
further questions concerning
the coming event.

Ed Armfield and Laurens
Walker will represent the DA-
VIDSONIAN at this meeting.

In 1953 he left Merck and
went to West Virginia to teach
for a year. Next he accepted
a job at Hampden-Sidney as
head of the Chemistry Depart-
ment. Dr. Fredericksen  re-
mained there three years and
taught both Freshman and Or-
ganic Chemistry.

At Davidson since the Fall
of 1957, he thinks this is a fine
schoot and says, “What I’ve
seen of southern education, it’s
right up front.”

Research being his primary
interest, Dr. Fredericksen has
introduced some of his . ad-
vanced students to research
problems of their own.

“I've got the highest student,

Aside from his teaching
and family activities, he is al-
so one of some fifteen-hun-

chemical magazine, Chemical

Abstracts. Material is sent to

him about twice a month,

which he abstracts for publl-
cation in the magazine.

ceives much of his free time.

A refreshing person to talk
to, he can always make one
laugh no matter how bad one
may feel. From his office in
one corner of the Chemistry
Lab, he has made chemistry un-
derstandable and enjoyable for
those students who come to himi
with their problems.

The Air Force pilot or navigator is a man of many talents. He is, first of all,
a master of the skies—and no finer exists. In addition, he has a firm back-
ground in astro-navigation, electronics, engineering and allied fields. Then,
too, he must show outstanding qualities of leadership, initiative and self-
reliance. In short, he is a man eminently prepared for an important future
in the new Age of Space. Find out today if you can qualify as an Air Force
