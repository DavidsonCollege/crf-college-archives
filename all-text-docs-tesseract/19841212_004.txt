Student Claims Elections Lacked

(continued from page 1)

ond Tuesday of winter term and that the
election is the following Tuesday.

Vaughn, explaining his position, said
“I've been interested in the Union Board
office. for a number of weeks now. Last
Tuesday night, Licinda Kellam asked
me why I hadn’t signed up.” Vaughn said
he knew approximately when the sign-
ups were but “put it in the back of my
mind [thinking] as soon as I see the pub-
licity, I’ll sign up.”

He said he explained his situation to
Laughlin Tuesday, a week ago, which
was the deadline. “He was sympathetic ,”
Vaughn said, but thought the by-laws
would deem him ineligible to sign up
late.

The Elections Council met last
Thursday morning to “try to make a fair
decision,” said council Chairperson Jen-
nifer Gotto. She said “we used two cam-
pus media, the SGA minutes and fliers
in the dorms” for publicity. The Davidso-
nian, because it-published the following
day, did not announce the deadline. She
said “Rob came across as knowing about
the election sign-ups and knew when
they were. We got the feeling he wanted
his case to be treated as an isolated

[one].” The Council decided not to allow
Vaughn to run.

Gotto added, “Now that Rob is con-
testing publicity,” the Council feels his
complaint is justified. “It opens up a dif-
ferent question,” she said, “it moves
from Rob’s isolated case to all the of-
fices.” Gotto, who put up a total of 30
fliers on the main doors of all dorms,
said “I assumed it would be enough; ob-
viously I assumed wrong.”

Vaughn argued “adequate [publicity]
means I should have known when the
deadline was. I, as an interested student,
should have been affected by adequate
publicity.” He presented petitions signed
by 357 students who claimed publicity to
be deficient.

Laughlin opened the floor for com-
ments. One student said, “three flyers
per dorm isn’t enough,” considering
many are torn off during parties. Senior
John Peeples asked “What is usual pub-

licity?” The council responded “for
winter elections there are no big post-
ers.” Another student added “last winter
there were fliers in every bathroom.”

Junior Sayres Rudy said “I went in

search of publicity; I actually looked and
there was nothing.” SGA off-campus
senator Ann Miano said “I’m disturbed
because students need a choice. I feel I
haven’t given the student body an oppor-
tunity to have a choice.”

Again, Peeples raised the question of
whether a precedent has been set for the

12 faculty committees including the-

steering committee. The faculty commit-
tees include Computer and Instructional
Support, Undergraduate Program, Spe-
cial Activities, Faculty, Library, Student
Development Services, Athletics, His-
tory and Purpose, Institutional Planning,
Organization and Administration, Finan-
cial Resources, Physical Resources, and
Institutional Advancement.

Each of these 6-to-14-member com-
mittees will construct its own report
“with a host of recommendations,” ac-
cording to Kelton. Each committee will
use information from the SGA report, as
soon as it is completed, as well as a 33-
page faculty questionnaire. Instead of
each committee distributing its own sur-
vey, Kelton said, they submitted ques-
tions to be included in one comprehen-
sive questionaire, distributed to all
Davidson faculty members, which has a
Dec. 17 deadline for completion.

In addition, each academic depart-
ment is responsible for completing its
own self-study report which is due Dec.
15. As things now stand, according to
religion Professor Sam Maloney, chair-
man of the faculty committee, “A lot of
things are on hold until all the data is in.”

The faculty self-study committees
will produce a preliminary draft by
March 15, and a final draft May 1. Ac-

amount of publicity needed. Sophomore
Mickey McDonald, a member of the
Elections Council; said “every year, fall
and spring there is more publicity be-
cause freshmen are involved. A lot of
people say winter term elections aren’t

_ publicized enough. Maybe the Senate

should work on it.” He added, “it was
publicized the same last year as this
year.” .

Sophomore Lucinda Kellam, who
was running unopposed for Union Vice-
President, said “publicity was poor, but

(continued from page !)

- cording to Kelton, the primary focus of

the self-study report “is not so. much a
historical chronicle as much as creating a
set of goals for the future.”

The self-study is required by the
Southern “Association of Colleges and
Schools for a renewal of Davidson’s ac-
creditation. Kelton said the individual
faculty reports will be consolidated, with
some editing and modification, by the
Steering Committee into a final self-
study report over the summer. The final
result, Kelton said, “will be available for
inspection by the community in early
fall.”

Maloney said the committee on fac-

Publicity

it concerns me that now people will run
just so the elections won't have candi-
dates running unopposed,” and just to
have an office.

‘Junior Nick Lowther added, “I’m a
hall counselor and didn’t know about the

_ freshman advisor’s elections.”

' The Senate voted to suspend the by-
laws and reschedule the sign-ups and

_ elections. Laughlin said he did not have

an immediate reaction to the decision:
“We'll just have to wait to see if it was a
good or bad one.” :

Self:Study Issues Surveys To Students

ulty was divided into eight parts to facili-
tate study. Teaching load and other
duties, statistical analysis, and working
conditions are three of the areas which he
said have been divided among committee
members for investigation.

He said his committee will rely
largely on faculty and student surveys
and departmental reports for its investi-
gation, as well as information gathered
by Assistant to the President Rick Love
and self-study committee member
Elizabeth Covington. Covington and
Love, Maloney said, provide informa-
tion “not readily available” in the Dean's
Office or historical records.
