A look backward: Dr. Ma

By SUZANNE CRAYMER
- Sentellé Dorm bears the name
of one of the most unique and
dedicated men in Davidson’s his-
tory. :
Dr. Mark Sentelle taught at
Davidson for 38 years, instilling a
firm respect for the rules and ide-
als of the college in his students.
“He was more than a teacher, he
“was a personality” the Charlotte
_ Observer stated.
The valedictorian of the

Davidson class of 1894,Sentelle

went on to recieve his Ph.D. at
Yale and Princeton. He returned
to Davidson in 1903 to teach reli-
gion and philosophy. In’1921,
Sentelle was appointed to the
newly created post of Dean of
Students, where he remained until
his retirement in 1940.

As both a professor and a dean,
his forceful personality affected
administration and _ students.
They knew him for his calm, dig-
nified manner and his belief in
going by the rules without excep-
tion. Sentelle treated all students
and faculty with the same exact-
ing fairness—extenuating cir-
cumstances didn’t matter.
Chalmers Davidson underlined
this point by explaining a typical

What can we believe about Santa?

By BILL SCOUTEN
Every Who
Down in Who-ville
Liked Christmas a lot...
But the Grinch,

Who lived just north of Who- |

ville,
' Did NOT!

Christmas. . .let’s think about it |

for a minute.

Presents, a Christmas tree,
friend, and parties. Great, isn’t
it?!

But, wait ...there’s more to this
festive occasion. What about
Santa Claus? What about old St.
Nick . . .who is he?

I’ve often wondered just how I
handled the notion of Santa Claus
as achild. I guess that Christmas
is such an exciting time that I
really didn’t question the identity
of Santa in all the pre-season
hubbub. ‘

What a hoot! In search of
Santa’s real identity .. .

Just a reminder -- Santa Claus,
who is said to reside in the North
Pole, resembles a jolly old elf
whose stomach jiggles likea bowl
full of jelly when he laughs. His
cheeks are rosy and his dimples,
how merry.

Although it is said that there is
only one Santa Claus, I could have
sworn that I saw Santa arriving in
NY, NJ, Pa, and Va simultane-
ously by train, plane, helicopter,
or car. What about his sled?

Perhaps old Rudolph’s light-
bulbed nose has burned out. .
.maybe Dasher has been afflicted

’ with arthritis of the hoof, or Don-

der was shot mistakenly, in the
backwoods of West Virginia as
hunting season opened in late
November.

What has happened to the rein-
deer that used to play such an
important part in the delivery of
the presents to all good little boys
and girls? Do cars, jets, and trains
get better gas mileage? Does it
take just too much time and effort
to keep reindeer fit and healthy?
Orisit that the reindeer are just too
busy playing “reindeer games” to
prance through the night'sky, their

bells heralding Santa’s glorious ©

arrival. Perhaps UPS can deliver
cheaper!

Santa is just not what he used to
be. I was sure when I saw at least
ten characters standing on the
street, each who claimed that he
was indeed Santa Claus. This
incident reminds me of the movie
classic “Miracle on 34th Street,”
its protagonist trying to prove his
identity in the midst of non-be-
lievers. Surely Santa Claus does
Cxist..,

~ What do little ones think? What

can they believein? Santais in the
mall, on the corner, in the win-
dowsofstores, on T.V. He is more
than a person, he is a movie star, a
celebrity. I would venture to say
that little Virginia O’ Hanlon was
. just as worried as I when she
asked:
_ “Tam eight years old. Some of
my little friends say there is no
- Santa Claus. Papa says, “If you
see itin the Sunit’s so.” Please tell
me the: truth, is there a Santa
Claus?”

_ What can we believe in?

In wake of that 1984 horror
movie Silent Night, Deadly Night
with its psychopathic. killer
dressed in a Santa suit, what do we
believe? Again, the question of
Santa’s identity . . .(may it be
pointed out that a simple rear-
rangement of the word’s letters
yields “satan.” Sort of special,
isn’t it! ?2@#$) |

What of the psychologists who
claim that Santa Claus does harm
to the children of society by sug-
gesting that good things will be
received regardless of behavior or
the critic that claims Santa Claus
as a symbol of commercialism?

Dare we believe in Santa as a
person?

I say yes! ;

Pat Boone in his book The Real

noon he tried to explain the situ-
ation to Sentelle. He described his
dilemma with eloquence and des-
peration. At the end of his long
speech Sentelle finally spoke.

“Ah, Mr. Henry Lilly, were you
absent from class today?”

Yes, sir.”
~ “You were not excused, were
you, Mr. Lilly?” ©

“No, sir.”

“That will be all.”

Such was the nature,of the
impartial justice doled “out by
Sentelle. However, Sentelle’s

- judgements did not only apply to

attendance problems, but also to
other broken rules and honor code
violations. He incorporated
Davidson’s values with his own
and served both consistantly and
fairly.

Students might not have loved
Sentelle for his justice, but they

4 respected him for his fairness,

dignity, humor and quiet Southern
charm,

When Sentelle died on April 13,
1945, the college mourned. So
that he wou!d be remembered, the.
dorm formerly named “East” was
dedicated to Sentelle and named
in his memory.

Christmas, | believe, addresses
this problem best. He relates his
experience of Christmas to the
reader. Christmas is overwhelm-
ing in its joy and happiness. Santa
is very real. But one day it hap-

pens.

“Dear Confidential Health,

Is cocaine really harmful? Is it
true that you can become ad-
dicted to it? From what I’ve
seen, it seems fairly harmless.
What do you have to say about
this?”

Cocaine is a widely misunder-
stood drug. For years there was a
misconception that cocaine was
not addicting. We now know
that that impression simply is
not true. ete

Cocaine stimulates the central
nervous system. Users report
elevated blood pressure and
pulse rate, increased respiration,
dilation of the pupils, and in-
creased excitement, among
other symptoms. The rapidity
with which cocaine acts upon
the body creates a “rush” sensa-
| tion. If cocaine is snorted, the
uptake response can occur in
about half aminute or less. Ifone
injects cocaine, the rush may

begin in less than 10 seconds.
The effect is relatively short-
lived, however, usually usually
lasting for 20 or 30 minutes. The
initial rush is seldom duplicated.
More and more cocaine is neces-
sary to provide a similar feeling.
For the beginning user there
appears to be little backlash from
the euphoria of the initial rush. As

~more cocaine is used to duplicate

the initial rush, the strength of the

“down side” increases.

Darryl Inaba, director of the
Haight-Asbury Drug Detox
Clinic, has said, “The longer you
use cocaine, the more natural
body stimulants (neurotransmit-
ters which make you alert, ex-
cited, involved, ambitious, and
motivated) are broken down. So

instead of becoming more active,

alert, and lifted, a person becomes
morose, irritable, and depressed.”

Because ‘cocaine mimics the
body’s natural functions, itis hard
for auser to recognize compulsive

~ behavior. Often, this compul-

. cocaine is 800-Cocaine by Dr.

sive use comes from fear of the
backlash or “down side” of the
cocaine rush.

Cocaine is usually some-
‘where from 30 to 80 percent
pure. This means that 70 to 20 _
percent of the ingested drug
consists of impurities. Dealers
often mix cocaine with a vari-
ety of substances like heroin,
inactive sugars, and local anes-
thetics in attempts to increase
their profits.
