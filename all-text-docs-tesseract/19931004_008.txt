Gul gays legal right to protect equality & justice

By Anna R. Kirkland
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote “In-
justice anywhere is a threat to justice every-
where.” Homophobia robs thousands of
American citizens of their dignity and secu-
ay. zy
Without civil rights protection forsexual

orientation, thousands of Americans suffer —

from rampant institutionalized discrimina-
tion. Oursociety is one of the most viciously
homophobic in the world; gays can lose
their jobs, be denied housing, and even have
their children taken away.

In 1991 the Cracker Barrel restaurant
chain fired several employees simply be-
cause they were gay. An openly lesbian
mother in Virginia lost custody of her two-
year-old son because of her homosexuality.

Most Americans agree that gays should not
be discriminated against (65% of respon-
dents to a U.S News poll said they want to
“ensure equal rights for gay people”); how-
ever, they mistakenly think gays are already
protected by federal anti-discrimination
laws.

We like tothink we live in a just society
that gives all its citizens an equal chance to
pursue happiness. The ugly reality is that
those among us who are attracted to the
“wrong” sex are excluded from the procla-
mations “All men are created equal” and
“Equal justice under law.” How can those of
us who love justice not be frightened?

The passage of a Civil Rights Act to
protect sexual orientation is the first step in
granting equal rights of citizenship to homo-

sexuals. Congress must answer unjust acts
by affirming that one’s sexual orientation is
neither a lifestyle choice nor an attribute that
determines other character traits.

Gays cannot change who they are, and
the individuals in the gay community are as
varied as their heterosexual counterparts.
Once our laws recognize homosexuality or
heterosexuality to be as immutable as skin
color, those who discriminate against gays
will no longer have the tacit permission of
government todoso; When that day comes,
justice everywhere will have been strength-
ened.

Various statements characterize the
misguided opposition to gay rights. “God
hates fags.” This sign which appeared on
the cover of Newsweeksums up the religious

opposition to gay rights in any form. Ac-
cording to the U.S. News poll, religions the
most important influence on people’s views
toward gays. Among religious respondents,
a staggering 79% oppose gay rights.

We must remember that the United
States is not a state governed by Christian
Biblical law. I do not underestimate the
clout of the religious opposition; however, I
hope our members of Congress recognize
that it stems from an irrational hatred which
has no place in our laws. :

“Gays want special rights.” How can
the right to keep your job, get housing, and
raise your own children be “special”? Ho;
mosexuals are not asking for rights beyond

A Response to the critics

By Alex Crumbley

I have good news. I have
figured out what everyone’s prob-
lem is. If we fix this problem,
everyone will be happy. Unfortu-
nately, I risk losing my livelihood
as opinions editor by revealing this
problem to you. But I am willing
to perform such self-sacrifice for
the good of my _ fellow
Davidsonians.

We bitch too much. Bitch,
bitch, bitch. If we took the four
hours we spenda week at meetings
whining about this and that, Patter-
son Court and dorm noise and
whatever else, and went running or
read a book or went out and had a
beer with some friends (oops! I
said it! Beer! hee hee Beer! hee
hee hee), we’d all be much hap-
pier, well-adjusted people. Plus, if

-we quit bitching and had a beer,

cool people would like us.

What are we selling? Marketing tells half the story

Private liberal arts colleges
like Davidson exert a tremendous
amount of time, resources, and
energy perfecting and promoting
their public image. For the most
part, this well-crafted package is
based on fact, with a bit of polish-
ing and refining along the way.

These finishing touches ac-
count for the discrepancy between
the glossy brochure snapshot of
incredibly intelligent looking stu-
dents engaged in an utterly stimu-
lating class discussion and the less
picturesque reality of college life,
complete with frigid, rainy days,
endless reading, and even one or
two tiresome class discussions.

This incongruity is an ex-
pected hazard of the college shop-
ping process; a student must ulti-
mately jump off the proverbial cliff,
send in the deposit, and hope they
were not misled by the fanfare of
Admissions’ rhetoric.

As a sophomore here, I have
had a year to assess the validity of
Davidson’s own claims. Ofcourse,
there were some disappointments
but none quite so disheartening as
the stunning $9.1 million Visual
Arts Center. Granted, it is a won-
derful asset to the Fine Arts De-
partment and will undoubtedly
enhance the comprehensive role of
the arts at Davidson. However, for
me, its glorious opening has re-

vealed some ugly aspects of our
illustrious institution.

When I decided to attend
Davidson two years ago, I was
aware that there were not any
classes offered in ceramics, and

pressure of a single fingertip, I
continued working through vari-
ous classes and programs over the
next two years. I was by nomeans
ready to abandonan interest which
had so quickly become a vital part

aconversation with Professor Cort
Savage, who is responsible for the
sculpture and ceramics aspect of
the Fine Arts Department, Ilearned
that there was indeed a wheel at
Davidson, along with glazes, and
several kilns. Unfortunately, I

would be allowed to use these fa-
cilities only in the context of an
independent study, the prerequi-
sites for which are Sculpture I and
II, courses which do not focus on
ceramics, much less wheel throw-
ing.

These requirements are not
unreasonable, although I thoughta
compromise might be possible,
considering my previous experi-
ence and that my interest was more
extra-curricular than academic.

cal depression often have chemi-
cal imbalances in the brain which
anti-depressants are used to cor-
rect.

However, anti-depressants are
not a cure-all which can be ac-

quired as easily as Tylenol and

must be used in conjunction with
therapy. Patients are evaluated

carefully before being prescribed
an anti-depressant, and like any
medicine, the prescription must be
followed precisely.

Furthermore, a clinically de-

I attended the “Future of
Patterson Court” forum Monday
night, unlike most students and
unlike all of the faculty. It was not
as constructive as it could have
been because Those Who Know
Best decided not to come. How
can poor, misguided, chemically
dependent college students decide
their own fate without the guid-
ance of the administration? We try
to have a forum, and you don’t
come. What’s the message there?
“Go drink a beer, boys and girls,
and quit bitching.” Well, OK!

Many teachers and a few stu-
dents have voiced complaints about
my section having too many refer-.
ences to, well, BEER. To this I
reply: the editorial section of a
newspaper mirrors the population
which produces it. If you think
Davidson students like beer too
much, you should have gone to the
Patterson Court forum and said so.
If you think my writers like beer
too much, become one of my writ-
ers and say something you think is
valuable.

I’ve also heard criticism of
Chris Frampton. People say he
shouldn’t still be working on the
paper because he’s enrolled at
UNCC instead of Davidson. They
say they don’t like the flippant
tone of his articles. Well, think
about the dedication it takes to
work on something you don’t get
any credit forjust because youcare
about it. That’s what he’s doing
this semester. For whom? A bunch
of people who bitch instead of say-
ing “Thanks.” So lay off him.

You may have noticed that
this week’s article is in quite a
different tone than I usually write.
That’s for a reason. I want you to
get fed up and write something of
your own. If you have nothing to
say, don’t nip at the heels of those
who do like an annoying little yip
dog.

Time for a little inside infor-
mation, compliments of the much-
under-fire editor of the opinions
section. There is no exclusive writ-
ers guild of select students who
hide inthe bowels of the Union and
write naughty things. Each week I
print my phone number and offer
the entire school a chance to write.
So if you don’t like something in
here, use your pen instead of your
mouth, and dobetter. Otherwise, I
‘don’t want to hear it. _
