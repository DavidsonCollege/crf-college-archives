the Geneva arms control talks, the U.S.
offered its response to the Soviet arms
proposal. The U.S. proposal calls for ba-
lanced reductions in nuclear arsenals,
which includes deep cuts in long range
nuclear weapons, but offers no com-
promises on the Strategic Defense Initia-
tive.

In other news, the Soviet newspaper
Izvestia published an edited version of

last Thursday’s interview with President
Reagan; Reagan’s criticism of Soviet
policy and his discussion of S.D.I. were
omitted.

In Washington, Vitaly Yurchenko, a
KGB official, denied that he willfully de-
fected to the U.S., but rather was kidnap-
ped and drugged by CIA officials; the
CIA rigorously rejected the charges, and
the State Department said he was free to
return to the Soviet Union; Yurchenko
went back to the USSR on Wednesday.

After six years of imposed silence,
Soviet dissident Andrai Sakharov spoke
by phone from Gorki to his family in the
US.

In South Africa, President Botha’s
National Party lost one of four open seats
to a more conservative faction in last
weeks midterm elections. Despite the
loss, Botha pledged to continue along the
“road of realism and levelheadedness” to
reform apartheid. The government im-
posed a ban on media coverage of unrest
in South Africa’s 38 restricted areas.

On Monday, Pretoria announced that
the Rev. Allen Boesak, an anti-apartheid
activist, will not be permitted to go to the
U.S. to receive the Robert F. Kennedy
Human Rights Award. Meanwhile, in
London, American civil rights activist
Jesse Jackson led thousands in anti-apar-
theid march outside the South African
Embassy.

In Mideastern developments, the
USSR and her East block satellites are
making tentative moves toward re-estab-
lishing diplomatic ties with Israel. Egyp-
tian President Mubarak and PLO Chair-
man Arafat met in Cairo to discuss their
views on the Mideast situation. In Syria,
Lebanese political officials are engaged
in discussion over a Syrian-sponsored
plan to settle the civil war that has
plagued Lebanon for the past 10 years.
Meanwhile, radical shiite groups in
Lebanon said that the four French and fire
American hostages will have no hope of
release until Kuwait frees 17 Shiite ex-
tremists.

Elsewhere in the world — To counter
U.S. charges that his regime is in danger
of collapse due to communist in-
surgency, Philippine President Marcos
called for elections to take place on Jan.
17. In New Zealand, two French intelli-
gence agents pleaded guilty to a reduced
charge of manslaughter in the sinking of
the greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior
last July.

U.S. spy planes reported that
Nicaragua may be picking up Soviet-
made weapons in Cuba. Accompanied by
his recently released daughter, El Sal-
vador’s President Duarte made a three-
day visit to the U.S. To curb the flow of
drugs into the U.S., the government
launched a massive anti-drug effort

armed against Columbia, Panama, Be-
lize and Jamaica. In Poland, Gen.
Jaruzelski resigned as premier to focus
hig attention on his work as chief of the
country’s Communist party. In down-
town Bogota, Columbia, violence broke
out between government troops and guer-
rilla forces.

Finally, an article in the Sunday edi-
tion of The Washington Post reported that
after four and one-half years of ineffec-
tive economic sanctions, President
Reagan ordered a plan for CIA covert ac-
tion to undermine the Lybian government
of Col. Muammar Qaddafi; President
Reagan has ordered an investigation into
the leak of this information.

On the home front, the nation’s
largest record companies have agreed to
place the warning label “Explicit Lyrics”
on albums, cassettes or videodiscs con-
taining explicit lyrics about sex, drug
abuse and violence.

Tests from President Reagan's sec-
ond check-up since his cancer surgery in
July indicate that he still remains in
“good health.” Finally, on Monday, after
three and one-half weeks lost in the Sac
ramento River, scientist finally managed
to guide Humphrey, the  40-ton
humpback whale, back into the Pacific.

mediocre person is always at his best.” —

Willingham speaks on duties, plans for Alumni Association

Carol Connor Willingham
‘77, youngest and first woman
president-elect of the Alumni As-
sociation, said her recent gradua-
tion “will help other young alumni
feel like more of a part,” she said.
“I know there are people who are
sixty-five who are more progres-
sive than | am. We've had some
leadership (in the
want

really good
Alumni Association). I
people to know they don’t have to
wait until they're forty years old to
get involved with the Alumni As-
sociation.

“I was really pleased a couple
of weeks after I got elected when I
got a letter from a woman who'd
graduated a couple of years ago
who wanted to get involved with
the Alumni Association and par-
ticipate in DAAP (Davidson
Alumni Admissions Program). |
know she’s not alone — I hope
that’s an indication there are more

like her out there,” Willingham
said.

Her duties, Willingham said,
consist of “reflecting the senti-
ments of alumni, not just my par-
ticular opinion (although I proba-
bly will have one.)”

Willingham served as decade
chairman for alumni giving and
currently works with the David-
son Alumni Admissions program.
“IT think those two experiences
have kept me in touch with my
classmates and the College,” she
said.

Of the College and alumni,
Willingham said, “I’m not sure
they're two separate entities. I'd
like to act as a conduit.”

Willingham, a member of the
first class of full-time degree-
seeking women enrolled at David-
son, called coeducation “ta won-
derful thing for Davidson men and
women.” She described — the
eighty-eight women in her class in

1973 as “just a nice group of
people — they (Davidson admis-
sions officers) were looking in
women for the same things they
were looking for in men — some-
one who will make a contrib-
ution.”

Willingham plans to establish
a “networking relationship” be-
tween these alumnae and current
students. she said, “I think be-
cause all the alumnae are young,
it’s really important for current
women students to have role mod-
Willingham said, ‘There
were two or three women profes-
sors when I was there’; now alum-
nae are “doctors, lawyers, and
homemakers” who can “share
problems and opportunities” with
current women students.

“Women who have graduated
from Davidson have a lot to offer.
Those resources are untapped.
We're determined; we're going to
get them — men and women.”

Nkomo lectures on South Africa’s “deep dilemma’

By ANDY CLARK

University of North Carolina
at Charlotte professor Mokubung
Nkomo lectured on the history and
problems of the current South Af-
rican situation last Tuesday night
at the Carolina Inn. Nkomo works
in the field of International Educa-
tion and Development and is the
author of Student Culture and Ac-
tivism in Black South African Unt-
versities.

According to Nkomo, a native
South African, South Africa has
declined at a “quickened pace”
since 1984. School closures and
campus incidents indicate the
“dire straits” of South Africa.

He said South Africa faces a
“deep dilemma” caused by a de-
clining economy, a shortage of
labor, and a decline in the value of
South African currency to about
thirty-five cents for each dollar.
These problems signify that ‘the
whole ideological edifice of Af-
rica. . . is beginning to disinteg-
rate.”

The young people of South
Africa are protesting the situation
by refusing to enlist in the army.
Such acts, Nkomo said, show “‘it
is only a matter of time until South
Africa will be free. The question
is how and when, because the

momentum is already _ here,”

Nkomo said.

Nkomo listed actions which
have been against the South Afri-
can government. since 1979,
about eleven states and thirty—
seven cities have withdrawn in-
vestments from American com-
panies in South Africa. “This is a
particularly important contrib-
ution because the © solution,”
Nkomo said, “can be sought
through non-violent ways.”

Economic sanctions against
the South African government
should also be used, Nkomo said.
Sanctions should be used in com-
bination with other methods to
“drive South Africa to some point

where they will have to reach a
just and rational conclusion.”

Nkomo concluded his speech
by saying, “the purveyor of vio-
lence is not the victim, but rather
the structure itself.” Thus, the
black South African majority has
been forced to protect themselves
against such “savagery” by the
white government as a last self-
defense, Nkomo explained

“Apartheid is a crime against
humanity,” Nkomo said, and the
South African system ts “the most
obnoxious system in the world ”

According to Nkomo, an en-

mity has existed between the
white minority government and
the black South African majority
since the creation of the Union of
South Africa in 1910. The Land
Act of 1913 which set aside only
thirteen percent of South African
land for the black majority ts the
source of the problem. Activisiis,
peaceful massive protests and or
ganizations such as the African
National signify at
tempts by the black south African
to attain a voice inthe South Atri
can government The — black
leadership. so far, has been ty
nored by the white
