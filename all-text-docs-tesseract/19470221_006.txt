young people, themselves, with the
exception of the last two inspira-
tional messages which were led by
Prof. A. C. Winn and Rev.
Williams. At the conclusion of
these rallies, it was found that the
young people desired another rally
and a candlelight service was held
later on.

At present plans are in the mak-
ing for establishing another com-
munity center in the Unity section.
The plans are advancing rapidly
and will soon be put into effect:
There are also plans under way to
hold another series of fall rallies
and to provide for a monthly skat-
ing party for all the young people
of the community.

To carry on work of this nature,
all kinds of talents are needed. If
you have an abundance of energy
and a desire to serve others, this
is your opportunity. Drop by the
