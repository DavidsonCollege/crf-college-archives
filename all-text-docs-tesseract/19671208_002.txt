Fearful Of Pruning

A committee can be many things.
One of those things is a place where
you put special little surprises to hide
them from peering eyes.

You simply wrap one up in red tape,
tie a discreet little knot in the pro-
ceedings and put it away until every-
body has forgotten it.

We desperately hope that is not
what will happen to the report of the
Blue Sky Subcommittee on Student
Life. The idea is bound to be a tempt-
ing one for some. .

It will be even worse if the commit-
tees play the role that is sometimes
attributed to the fraternity system.
That, of course, is the role of the
polisher of rough edges. rubbing away
at the oddities that stick out until
nothing is left but that familiar old
zero. °
Hiding behind the Woodrow Wilson
quotation that begins the report is
one of the most perceptive documents
that has ever appeared amongst the
spider webs around here.

It recommends things that some
will say could never happen at David-
son. If that pessimistic evaluation is
true, then the college had better re-
consider its boasts about being one of
the leading schools in the South.

This subcommittee has done what
few other groups around here ever do:
it has produced something really
creative. Even the Blue Sky curricu-
lum report contained few ideas that
were not copied from other sources.

The Student Life Subcommittee,
however, has used the information it
gathered through research at other
campuses to create some ideas that
would be unique for Davidson.

Its report says that the group took
as its assumptions the ideals of “total-
ity,” “flexibility,” and ‘involvement.”
To the cynics, these could be empty
words.

But they could be words loaded with
meaning for Davidson if the report is
not emasculated by the string of other
committees which will now consider
it.

Tin Pan Patriotism

One of the more inspiring songs to be dragged out of Tin Pan Alley or
bounced out of Nashville (wherever it is that songs come from nowadays)

concerns a father’s advice to his son.

The song is supposed to be the father’s reply to his son's letter asking
his opinion about some of the things the son has met in college for the first
time. The father magnanimously admits that some the greatest Americans
have worn long hair. Flowing locks are supposed, therefore, to be tolerable.

Then as the strains of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” break into the
father’s monologue, he says his son’s mother will always love him even if he
burns his draft card. Because, after all, “ .. . She is a woman.”

But the father is a true patriot. If the son does not love the good ol’
American free enterprise system, then he should not be living in it. If the
son burns his draft card, then he may as well burn his birthright because the
father wil! not claim the disloyal rascal as his son.

Now would anyone still really care to admit that patriotism cannot be
twisted into a disgustingly perverted disease,

What Might Have Been

After one gets through choking over
the preamble and forgets what the
proposed student constitution could
have been, it is apparent that the draft
outlines a very serviceable student
government.

We like very much the statement
that part of the Senate’s function shall
be to help in the making and imple-
mentation of college policy. Articie IV,
the rights and responsibilities of stu-
dents, is very worthwhile.

We have said before and surely will
say again we wish that the revision
committee had tried to bridge the gap
between students and the rest of the
college. At least the document is flexi-
ble enough so that it does not preclude
such a move.

Since most other governmental de-
tails are apparently to be covered in
the by-laws, it would have been smart
to include the number of dorm rep-
resentatives there also. If the college
follows the advice of the Blue Sky
Subcommittee on Student Life to build
a new dormitory, a full amendment
will have to be made to the constitu-
tion. That will certainly be one of the
very least exciting votes ever taken
at this home of unexciting votes.

The revision committee has cleaned
up the clutter of the old constitution.
For that much they can be praised.

It is just up to someone else now to
build something on that clear land
with the flexible tool given to the stu-
dent body by the revision committee.

A Nick In Time

Over the last couple of weeks the
College Union Board has discussed the
possibility of asking the Student Coun-
cil to reschedule to an earlier date the
election of next year’s Union presi-
dent.

The reasoning for this discussion is
that a block-booking conference is
scheduled to be held in February in
order to give colleges an opportunity
to purchase entertainment for the
next year at a reduced price. If the
Union is represented at the confer-
ence by its outgoing president, it can-
not make really definite commitments
for whatever entertainment, the next
year’s board might want.

Special reasons then argue for the
earlier election of the Unoin presi-
dent. But an earlier election for all
student body offices is itself a good
idea.

When a student takes over a new
post with only a month or so to serve,
as is the case under the present sys-
tem, all he can do is simply hold to-
gether his organization for the rest
of the year. He does not really have
time to implement any new programs.

This time comes during the first
semester of the next year.

If the officer is a senior, however,
his interest in his office and in David-
son begins to dwindle during the sec-
ond semester of that year. Graduate
schools, marriages and jobs tend to
occupy more of his planning.

The student body then generally
gets the full use of its senior officers
for only one semester. The junior who
is supposedly full of new ideas (why
else would he run for the office) does
not have time during the last few
weeks of second semester to imple-
ment his ideas. For the second semes-
ter senior, that time is more profita-
ble devoted to interests away from Da-
vidson.

If the second-semester senior still
cares about the school, his concern

should not be wasted with the triviali-

ty of running an organizaiton. That
last semester should be a time for him
to look back over his four years to see
what was really important, to see how
he could have better used his organi-
zation to improve the school. Then, if
asked, he could give the advice of an
elder statesman to his successor.

Davidson’s present system of having
most new officers take over their posts
after spring vacation wastes much of
the potential of these students. Hold-
ing elections as soon after the end of
the Christmas holidays as is feasible
would give the student body more use
of its representatives.

Ducking Duty

In a student body referendum held

yesterday, Davidson students voted
down a proposed stricter rule against
dormitory fires. Reasons behind the
defeat seem to vary. Some students
simply opposed the passage of “yet
another rule” on campus. Some ap-
pear to have read into the proposed
regulation more than it actually would
have entailed.
_ But whatever the reasoning, the
implication of the rejection of the
proposal is that the students have
simply refused to accept the respon-
sibility of having a stronger rule
against the setting of fire in the dor-
mitories. This rejection of responsibi-
lity comes at a very inopportune time.
Many efforts have been made this year
to demonstrate that the students are
responsible enough to govern their
dormitory life and that they should be
given a larger voice in the affairs of
the college.

_But before added authority can be
given the voice of the students, the
students must prove, first, their desire
for more authority and, second, that
they can responsibly handle greater
power. The rejection of the stronger
fire rule will hardly help this cause.

New Constitution Likened
To American Document

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Statf Weiter

It happened in Philadelphia
in 1787. It is happening
again in Davidson in 1967, on
a lesser scale.

To the student of American
history, the resemblance be-
tween the proposed Student
Government Association
(SGA) Consitution and the
United States Constitution is
too striking to miss, especial-
ly upon first reading the SGA
Constitution.

The preamble, the Senate's
power to appropriate funds,
the article forbidding bills of
attainder and ex post facto
laws, the “lifetime” judiciary
membership, the bill of
rights, the provisions for
amendment— all are very
reminiscent of our country's
supreme document.

Senior Mike Bates, ‘‘the
Father of the Constitution,”
said it was not consciously
modeled after the U. S. Con-
stitution, but noted many
similarities. Like James
Madison, Bates did his home-
work by reading the consti-
tutions of many other schools
in preparation for the task
of revision.

Just as the Founding Fath-
ers were instructed to revise
the Articles of Confederation,
so the Constitution Revision
Committee was assigned fo
revise the present Constitu-
tlon, drawn up in 1937. In ef-
fect, both groups devised a
different form of government
from that which previously
existed.

The preamble states that

the Constitution is being es-.

tablished to ‘‘share .. . re-
sponsibility with the Board
of Trustees, the faculty and
the administration’ in cam-
pus affairs. The response of

both the students and the
faculty, administration and
Board of Trastees will deter-
mine how effectively this can
be done.

One basie premise upon
which the Constitution is
based is that the dormitory
structure has become at least
equal in importance to with
the class structure. Their
representation in both the
legislative and judicial bodies
will be determined partially
by dormitory selection.

Something which is notably
missing from Article II is the
failure to say what classes
the president and vice presi-
dent of the SGA will be se-
lected from.

It would be wise to add a
provision that the president
be a rising senior and the
vice-president a rising junior,
in order to ensure that an ex-
perienced person can head
the government while a
younger person receives the
valuable experience of serv-
ing in the President's ab-
sence.

This provision, however, is
currently in the committee's
projected by-laws.

The size of the Senate was
reduced from 32 to 23 in com-
mittee meetings, according to
Bates, “so that every sena-
tor will feel free to speak
out during a meeting.” Since
much of the Senate's work
will be done in committees,
Just as in the United States
Congress, this number seems
wise, since many non-sena-
tors can participate on the
committees.

According to Franklin And-
erson, secretary of the Re-
vision Committee, the union
of the legislative and execu-
tive is modeled somewhat

after the English Cabinet-
Parliament set-up. The Sen-
ate Executive Committee.
like the cabinet, will meet to
decide upon the agenda for
the Senate meetings.

The SEC will perform the
work of the president of the
present Student Council, thus
providing that the work does
not all fall upon one man and
yet allowing the president of
the SGA to asume as much
responsibility as he wishes.
The Senate. like the Parlia-
ment, has the final legislative
power.

The Court of Appeals,
which has powers similar to
that of the United States Su-
preme Court, will hear only
cases referred to it by infer-
lor courts.

Because there will be few
people who are willing to be-
come so familiar with the
constitution as to do a good

‘job, it is good that a mem-

ber will remain on the com-
mittee from the time he is
elected until he graduates.

The Bill of Rights is one of
the most unique features of
the constitution. Many of the
rights assured in this article
are the same as those in the
first 10 amendments to the
U. S. Constitution.

“The by-laws to the Consti-
tution will contain many of
the answers to these ques-
tions, said Anderson ‘The
Constitution is as short as we
could make it, without leav-
ing out what we felt were the
essential points." The by-
laws will be completed and
presented to the student body
in February.

Let's just hope that, if the
Constitution is approved, it
will last as long and be as
successful as the American
Constitution.

Bill Of Rights Mars
Student Constitution

By JOE BEARD
Guest Columnist

It is said that among de-
liberate bodies, there is only
one hard and fast scientific
law: that the length of time,
depth of investigation and
amount of discussion will ail
vary inversely with the im-
portance and the significance
of the proposal.

Thus, a resolution to raise
the salary of the janitor may,
and usually is, debated longer
and more intensely than one
appropriating $20 billion for
a program of poverty elimi-
nation.

So also with the Constitu-
tion Revision Committee.

The committee labored

many long and, from the ru-.

mors, quarrelsome months in
revising the present Student
Body Constitution.

Over every word of it, it
would seem, there has been
full and ample debate once,
if not several times, during
their sessions. The result has
been a revision which, though
not perfect, and indeed con-
taining many foolish provis-
ions, is as acceptable as the
old one.

However, it would seem
that during the last week of
their deliberations the mem-
bers of the committee were
struck with some sort of
madness, for during this last
week—indeed, during the last
session of the week—they in-
terpolated into the body of
a commendable document an
article entirely new and ill-
considered, which the com-
mittee seems to have ac-
cepted as a report without
reservation from a subcom-
mittee whose membership
seems to have been singular-

ly delinquent in reporting at
all

This subcommittee’s duti-
ful diligence in debating and
discussing this most import-
ant portion of the Constitu-
tion is manifested by the fact
that it is a poorly disguised
rewrite of a National Stu-
dent Association pronounce-
ment on student power.

The depth of thought attri-
butable to these would-be
solons may be assessed from
the contradictions, meaning-
less sentiments and irrele-
vancies contained therein.

Indeed, following the ex-
ample of a noted English
proféssor, the author offers
a 35-cent cigar to the first
student who discvovers any
meaning whatsoever in sub-
section IV, 3, A, which I
quote:

“Neither the college nor
any student organization shall
infringe upon the rights of
students as citizens, but stu-
dents shall remain subject ot
the obligations of their mem-
bership in the academic com-
munity.”

Or, who can reconcile the
broad concept of a lberal
education pye- supposed
throughout the revised Stu-
dent Body Constitution with
the narrow concept which
underlies IV, 4, A.

If there be any members
of these subcommittee in any
way susceptible to the grim
contagion of Reason, or any
student who would venture
into the disillusioning realm
of Rationality, I should like
to recommend Dr. Russell
Kirk's article on student pow-
er in the current issue of Bill
Buckley's ‘‘National Review.”

If the Revision Committee
introduced this so-called ‘‘bill
of rights’’ in order to divert
any criticism from the real
Constitution, then their knack
for political strategy has long
been overlooked by this au-
thor.

If however, it were meant
to be considered seriously as
a part of the Constitution of
this Student Body, the mem-
bers ought to consider a visit
to Dr. Kelton’s caves.

Freedom Superior To Indigestible Blob

Remember the good old days of required vespers?
Sunday night when the cutting was high and the leav-
ing was easy. John Calvin couldn’t have done any bet-
ter in rounding up the saved and the damned alike for
a some of that force-fed religion once a week.

But then the idea that perhaps worship was per-
haps a very personal thing which had no value at all
if it was not voluntary became widely enough accepted
even among the trustees to cause the abolishment—
for at least a trial’period—of required religion. Those
who attended vespers to worship still do so and those
who went to sleep, read, or just generally screw around
also still do so, but without the bother of singing hymns
between chapters or the drone of a dull speaker to help
bring on a nap. Salvation at the College Church may
not be quite as witespread these days, but sincerity
has certainly increased. — .

Sincerity and salvation are now. the issues of an-
other area of Davidson life, one which many students
and faculty think to be at least as important as religion
—that is our intellectual life. ;

Chapel-assembly periods at Davidson are cursed,
in general, with the same sort of indifference and
apathy on the part of students which marked the re-
quired vespers program. This is partly because of the
quality of some of the speakers we are forced to listen
to and partly simply because we are forced to listen to
them, whether they be worth listening to or not. And
occasionally they are decidedly not. ;

It is true that there are reasons for having a re-
quired assembly, and I'm sure that we've all heard
them at least once. But for those who missed out, rea-
soning runs thus: first, assembly periods are a good
way to get the student body of a school this size to-
gether once in awhile—it gives us a sense of cohesive-
ness. Secondly, when assembly is required a substan-
tial percentage of boys come who would not otherwise
attend and many, or some of them wind up enjoying a
speaker they would not otherwise have had the oppor-
tunity to enjoy.

In reply to the first contention, it seems to me
that too much cohesion can produce not a unified
group but an indigestible blob. Surely we can get as
much of that feeling of unity and good old high school
spirit as we need at athletic events and occasional
necessary assemblies, But then just how much of a
spirit of togetherness does a college like Davidson
need? The few individuals on campus seem to think
that less, rather than more is needed in intellectual
areas and I am inclined to agree.

As for making us come so we’can enjoy or derive
benefit from a speaker or program we otherwise might
not hear—I wish they wouldn’t be so good to us. We're
all big boys now and as Davidson students we are
supposedly capable of making value judgements such .
as the worth of hearing someone who has something °
to say or sitting in Mary's for 40 minutes. For those
who are not capable now of such judgment, it will have
to come by personal experience if it comes at all—
intellectual sincerity can not be forced any more than
can religious sincerity. .

There are some factors on the horizon which may
help the situation somewhat. According to the Blue
Sky Committee recommendations the assembly period
next year is to consist of a required half hour talk
and a voluntary half hour of discussion or “coffee”
afterwards. This will let students attend who would
like to come to the discussion but can not because of
classes. This is good as far as it goes, but it still leaves
two required chapel periods a week to be filled by a
sometimes inept speaker and a normally inattentive
student audience.

Scott ‘Woodmansee, who is currently in charge of
the chapel-assembly program, has proposed that he be
required to fill only one chapel period a week with the
$5,000 a year now alloted him. (At present he has to
use this money to fill both periods, one of which is
supposed to be on a religious subject.) The other period
he wants to devote to the student and local activities
such as the wind ensemble, male chorus, etc.

This too is an improvement, but it still leaves a
lot of potentially worthless periods to be slept through
by the many, Why not adopt Woodmansee’s proposal
for one worthwhile required period a week and make
the other voluntary? Or even better, why not make all
chapel periods voluntary, with the exception of an
occassional necessary student body meeting, and let
each student make his own value judgement? It is at
least worth a try, and if we, the students of Davidson
are as good as they tell us we are, maybe they owe us
the chance to prove it.
