Edges Brevard For First Two Wins

By Jennifer Roos

After being terminated in 1986,
women’s basketball has returned
to Davidson College for the 1991-
92 season under head coach John
Filar. The team ended its 1,865-
day absence from Davidson by
defeating Brevard College 60-59
Saturday afternoon in Belk Arena.

The victory gave the Wildcats
atwo-game winning streak. Previ-
ously, they beat Washington & Lee
59-42 in Lexington, Virginia.
Senior captain Faison Nuckolls led
the way inthe victory with twenty-
three points and fourteenrebounds,
and junior guard Jennifer Roos had
eight points and nine assists. That

_game marked the ‘Cats’ first vic-

tory and came over another school
just beginning a women’s program.
“We played extremely well,” Filar
said. “I was impressed with our
composure on the road. They are
playing withoutrecruits and schol-
arships just as we are. The victory
shows that we are moving in the

- right direction.”

Playing without uniforms
against Brevard, the Wildcats, who
were backed by strong crowd sup-
port, pushed the lead to eight points
at 20-12. At halftime the ‘Cats led
by five points. At the beginning of
the second half, they proceeded to
hit their first three shots and ex-
tended the lead to eleven. Their
largest margin was thirteen points.

Swimmers Fall to ECU,
Prepare for Busy Home

By Chris Hood
Although Davidson’s mens’ and
womens’ swimming and diving
squads fell 120-102 and 98-74,
respectively, at East Carolina on
January 11, head coach Ron Mor-
row left Greenville pleased with

the ‘Cats’ performances.
“They’re pretty much a power-
house,” he conceded of the Pirates.

Brevard dropped into a zone
defense in the second half in order
to shut down Nuckolls, who scored
sixteen of her twenty-two points in
the first half. In addition, they used
a full court press and forced
Davidson turnovers., cutting the
lead to 44-40 with under ten min-
utes remaining. It was tied acouple
of times, but the Wildcats held on
toaoneto three point lead through-
out the final minutes of the game.

Junior guard Jenny Plowright,
who finished with eight points, and
freshman forward Kristin Solsrud,
who finished with ten points and
eight rebounds hit several key
outside shots against the zone de-
fense. Senior captain Skye
MacLeod led Davidson with nine
rebounds and also had eight points,
while freshman Margaret Baker
came off the bench to grab six re-
bounds.

Brevard had a chance to win
the game ona last second shot with
the score 60-59, but the shot was
off target and MacLeod grabbed

. therebound. “Itcouldn’thave been

a better home opener,” Filar said.
“Tt was very exciting to play in
front of that many people and to
beat a school like Brevard with an
established program.”

Davidson faces Pfeiffer away

on Monday, and the next home -

game is Saturday at three o’clock
against Meredith College.

“Tt was a very positive experience
for us to swim and dive against that
caliber. We learned a lot there.
We’re scoring points, and with
more experience we’ll continue to
get better.”

Over Christmas Break, the teams
traveled to the University of Tampa
to compete in a meet against
schools such as Xavier, North

School Records Fall

in Women

's Track's

By Peter Hurtado
Though plagued by early injuries, the women’s track and field team still
managed to open their 1992 campaign with several new school records

and some promising performances.

Senior captain Kathy Beach led the way, setting school records with
fine times in the mile (5:20.4) and 1000m (3:11.2) events. Beach is
coming off her most successful cross-country season ever and is sure to
carry her success onto the track again this spring.

Freshman Maria Whitehead recorded a school record performance
in the 200m (29.6) in her first ever collegiate race. Whitehead also ran
well in the 500m; her time of 1:25.9 makes her one of Davidson’s best

_ ever in that event:

took sixth in the meet, while the
men came in eighth. Again, Mor-
row was encouraged with the ef-
forts, especially “considering we
only took half the team.”
Looking ahead, the ‘Cats will
return home Saturday, January 25
to face the University of the South,
Georgia Southern and UNCC.

Carolyn hopes to continue her improvement and will surely provide
some great performances this spring.

Sophomore Jean DeMoss began her season with a mile time of
6:01.8. Sophomores DeMoss, Lisa Sitek and Jennifer Humphrey will
provide this women’s squad with valuable racing experience this spring,
while freshmen Whitehead, Meadows and Sarah Orsbon add plenty of
talent. Multiple school record-holder Heather Tarpley returns this spring
in good shape after a semester abroad.

Coaches Andrew and Manson are pleased with the performances of
this weekend, and hope to see further improvement. The women will
sendrunners to the US Air Invitational and to the Lynchburg invitational

next weekend.
