Separating, The Issues

One thing has emerged from the
clouded questions around which yes-
terday’s referendum was based: there
is a definite dissatisfaction with the
status quo as far as the drinking rule
in the student body constitution is
concerned. ‘

As one Student Council member
stated after the votes were counted,
“This is obviously a mandate for some
sort of change in this area.”

It is unfortunate that the issues
were not clearly defined in the ballot-
ing yesterday; however, we feel that
a more lucid statement of student
body opinion is now in order.

This confusion of issues in the ref-
erendum question was one reason the
Student Council opposed the passage
of the amendment. As the statement
released “by the Council this week
read, “The Student Body referendum
on this issue should speak more clear-
ly....”

A large segment of the student
body is opposed to the drinking rule
as it now stands. Whether this dis-
satisfaction lies in the area of student
enforcement, the question of a “wet”
or “dry” campus, the duty-bound/-
honor-bound controversy or the au-
tomatic suspension rule is not clear
because of the many and varied im-
plications which outright repeal of the
rule might infer.

Therefore, we would propose that
the Student Council—as the elected
representatives in furthering the best
interests of the student body-——con-
duct a student opinion poll as soon as
possible on the following questions:
1. Do you favor drinking on the lake

campus? Yes or no.

2. Specify one: a

a. I am opposed to any drinking on
the town campus. .

b. I support drinking without geo-
graphical restrictions anywhere
on the town campus.

c. I support drinking in restricted
areas on the town campus.
Drinking should be permitted
—on the fraternity court
—in the dormitories
—in the Union
—at events sponsored by the

new Social Council

_~-at athletic events
3. As long as there is a drinking rule

in the Student Body constitution,

members of the Honor Court and

Student Council should be honor-

Costly Oversight

Last December the faculty request-
ed President D. Grier Martin to con-
fer with the President of the Trustees,
Dr. J. McDowell Richards, in order to
appoint a joint faculty-trustee com-
mittee “to formulate a truly meaning-
ful Statement of Purpose and Policy
on the Consumption of Alcoholic Bev-
erages by Davidson Students.”

As of yet this committee has not
been appointed.

This action was taken by the fac-
ulty more than five months ago, at
the same time that the trunk rule was
approved by the professors.

Somehow we feel that, had this
group been appointed, some of the an-
tagonizing events of the past few

bound to enforce the regulation.
Yes or No
4. As long as there is a drinking rule
in the Student Body constitution,
members of the Student Body
should be duty-bound to enforce
the regulation.
Yes or No

A poll conducted along the above
questions would give a clear-cut sam-
pling of student opinion on the two
main arguments put forth before yes-
terday’s voting.

With hardly more than one week
remaining in the school year, it is
doubtful that any definite, prudent
change can be made this year. Never-
theless, the results of such an opinion
poll can be used as a tangible basis
for any action which the Student
Council may undertake—most likely
at the beginning of school this fall.

We are not advocating a needless
delay by the Council in confronting
the issue. Rather, Student Council
members as a committee of the whole
could wisely use the summer months
assembling pertinent information in
order to more readily implement any
changes that might be proposed in
this area. .

Responsibility seems to be the is-
sue some advocates of change have
voiced. Yet to repeal the drinking rule
from the student body constitution
without corresponding faculty-admin-
istrative action along the same line
appears to remove any realm of stu-
dent responsibility and enforcement
in what is obviously an area of im-
portant student concern.

There is something acid about call-
ing for student defiance of any college
regulation, especially when adminis-
trators have stated unequivocably that
they will enforce this regulation if it
is abrogated by students.

Liberalizations have only recently
been made by the faculty in the cut
system, vespers rule and trunk rule.
All changes were originally requested
by students and reached. not by stu-
dent defiance of the faculty as voiced
by some supporters of yesterday's ref-
erendum, but by logical presentations
by student representatives of the rea-
sons behind such requests.

This is why we feel that the com-
pilation of student opinion on specific
issues as suggested above is the next
logical step for the Student Council in
determining the best interests of the
student body.

weeks on the drinking rule might
have been avoided. Sensing student
opinion on this matter, such a com-
mittee could have clearly defined the
current policy of the college and.
thereby prevented any possible mis-
understandings which have arisen.

President Martin assured THE DA-
VIDSONIAN this week that the facul-
ty’s request will be carried out as soon
as possible.

We regret that this oversight in
the president’s office has occurred;
however, we share the hope that the
immediate formation of this commit-
tee will be a positive step by the fac-
ulty and trustees in an area of real
Student concern.

dent Leadership Committee.

Perhaps the most obvious thing we
learned from the two days of confer-
ences was that the Republican Party
is “running scared.”

The meeting was officially billed
as the National Student Leadership
Seminar, which sounds about as inno-
cent as the Golden Years Club. The
speakers and program were not so in-
nocent as we soon found out, how-
ever.

Republican Senators and Congress-

men spoke candidly and profoundly
to the approximately 200 students who
represented colleges in nearly every
part of the United States. Nearly ev-
ery speaker lamented specifically the
tremendous blunder of 1964 in the
GOP.
The lugubriousness fell on few re-
ceptive ears, however, as did the age-
old plea for maintenance of a strong
two-party system in America.

The seminar itself was unique, be-
ing the first of its kind ever spon-
sored in any way by a national polit-
ical party.

The greatest value in the confer-
ence was being able to talk informally
with student leaders, who can serious-
ly face the problems that arise on
their own campuses as well as off the
campus.

Such serious discussions and de-
bates among college students seem to
go unnoticed these days by news me-
dia around us, in favor of the rather
sensational and melodramatic in col-
lege life. Nevertheless, we feel this
country’s heritage worth praising oc-
casionally, no matter how trite the ex-
pressions might sound.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Cecil's Troops Expand Assault On ROTC

Aiken

Dear Editor,

Since 1919, many students of
Davidson College have been
complaining about the require-
ment that all qualified students
complete two years of basic
ROTC to be eligible for gradu-
ation. But for some reason, the

*yequirement has remained in-

tact.

Again compulsory ROTC is
being attacked. The difference
between this attack and those
which preceded is that it is
not based upon a mere dislike
for the program, but on a sin-
cere belief that the requirement
is not in keeping with the stated
purpose of Davidson College.

This inconsistency seems ob-
vious in the light of a number
of statements contained in the
Statement of Purpose as found
in the first three pages of the
Davidson College Catalogue.

“Davidson's primary pur-
pose is to develop men of hu-
mane instincts, of disciplined
and creative minds and of
Christian character.”

Does the training of students
in the tactics of organ:zed killing

t

serve this end? Does a system.

of merits and demerits for clean-
ing weapons, brass, and shoes
develop the type of discipline
and creativity mentioned above?
Are not the elements of discip-
line and creativity more avail-
able in the truly academic
courses of this liberal. arts col-
lege?

“Davidson is a college of
liberal arts. As such it em-
phasizes those studies, dis-
ciplines and activities which
liberate men physically, ment-

ally and spiritually.”

Does two years of compulsory
ROTC liberate men in the sense
of any of these terms? We al-
teady have compulsory physical
training, compulsory academic
courses, and compulsory church
attendance, Are these not suf-
ficient?

“Davidson concentrates up-
on the study of history, litera-
fure, music and the arts, the
physical, natural and social
sciences, languages, mathe-
matics, phitosophy and re-
ligion.”’

What does the college mean
by ‘‘concentrates?"* It has omit-
ted ROTC from this academic
roster. The college requires two
years of ROTC, but not so much
as a-single hour of music, art,
or philosophy. Except for the
requirements of literature and
language. which accelerated
students may exempt in part,
students are required to study
more military science than any
other items on the list. (A stu-
dent who spends four years in
the program will have more
hours of military science than
any other subject save that of
his major.)

“It (Davidson) must also
provide these men with the
time and opportunity for crea-
tive scholarship which is fun-
damental to the best teach-
Ing.”

Since the two years spent
studying ROTC do not contri-
bute time or opportunity for
creative scholarship, do they
not then detract from the ac-
tual time and opportunity stu-
dents “may have for creative
scholarship?

“, .. Its (Davidson’s) frus-

fees, ifs faculty, its students
and Its friends must constantly

rededicate themselves to their

task. Only through ceaseless
effort and sacrificial labor can
they make of Davidson what
it seeks to be — A Christian

\lberal arts college second to

none in the service of God and
of man.”

If Davidson is to be consistent
with its stated purpose, it must
subject all its aspects, depart-
ments, personnel, and students
to the rigid test outlined by the
statement of purpose. When {t
finds itself falling short of the
mark set by the purpose, it

must strive to overcome its
weaknesses. It is obvious that
compulsory ROTC falls far short
of the mark.

The only way to correct this
flaw is to remove the require-
ment of basic ROTC for all stu-
dents. Davidson must do this,
or change its Statement of Pur-
pose.

Dear Editor:

If ever in the future a scholar
fond of literary allusions is in-
spired to author a new edition
of Miss Cornelia Shaw's mo-
mentous history of Davidson
College, he might refer to the
year of 1965 as the ‘winter of
our discontent.”

Drama Department Stages
New, ‘Absurd’ Experiment

By PRESTON FAGGART
A Review

One corner, of the Davidson
Campus is not afraid of the new,
the experimental, the different,
as the events of last week
plainly showed. The events were
the twin billing of TIonesco’s
Chairs and New Tenant,
the third major Drama Produc-
tion at Hodson Hall.

The plays belong to a body of
recent theater writing Martin
Enslin has called “Theater of
the Absurd”, and although the
plays are 10 to 8 years old (res.)
they dre perhaps 50 years ahead
of the prevailing Davidson cul-
tural climate.

“Absurd” plays often become
“anti-plays” with complete dis-
regard and reversal of stand-
ard theater conventions and
sometimes become super-plays
in which the familiar, the easily
understood, trite, fully prece-
dented techniques are blown sky
high and reach monumental
nothingness (as perhaps the pop
painter Roy Lichtenstein will
blow up a frame from a cheap
comic strip complete with bal-
looning dialogue to the size of
Rembrandt’s Night Watch.)

In Davidson’s production of
Chairs, two veteran thespians,
Constance Welsh and Simon
Blackford, collaborated with a

host of real but invisible guests,
whose presence we are aware
of by the chairs that are brought
on stage to accommodate them,
by a lighting crescendo, and the
personal attention of their hosts.
The play pulled its audience
through a terrific variety of
emotions by means of high trag-
edy. low comedy, banality, pa-
thos. bathos, grandios rhetoric,
noble sentiment, and brutal nat-
uralism. Mr. Blackford in the
role of the Old Man (95) and
Mrs. Welsh, his wife Semiramis
(94) turned in the best perform-
ances so far this season at Da-
vidson in the difficult and some-
times exasperating roles. The
mood and mystery of this sad,
beautiful play were thoroughly
and exquisitely realized by these
consummate artists.

The Chairs ends in deep pes-
simism, as the Orator, the only
non-invisible guest (Rawley Tur-
ner), delivers the message the
Old Man has entrusted to him
as the summation of the thought-
ful philosopher's life: NOTHING
AT ALL to a stage full of empty
people.

The New Tenant which
follows is a zannie piece with
Michael Light in the title role,
Nancy Copeland as a super-daft
irascible caretaker of drab fats
in London, two furniture mov-
ers: Mike Arrowood and Ed

Craig, and finally wall to wall,
floor to ceiling furniture.

The play seemed to breeze by

with bewildering speed as the.

furniture kept pouring in and
finally we realize the poor man
is so bogged down with his ob-
jects, material possesions, their
is no room left for life.

Light is super-cool in his role,
which in some ways is his role
in life, an English gentleman
full of wry and subtle humor.
Miss Copeland in her own way
carries the part with verve and
dazzle.

The evening was a rare treat.
Such difficult and important
plays deserve a larger audience
than was present (there were
enough chairs on stage by the
end of Chairs to accommo-
date most of the visible audi-
ence.)

And more to the credit of the
Drama Department's head and
play's director Rupert Barber is
the fact that the conditions un-
der which he struggles are se-
verely limiting. The facilities
are grossly inadequate. The
Stage is portable, cramped and
allows none but the most awk-
ward maneuverability. Most
schools have better resources in
spite of some expensive if fal-
lable layouts lighting-wise and
soundwise.

might find his inspiration in the
college library a likely source
of literary allusions, where Miss
Shaw's portrait regally glares
down on the pericdical room.

Our discontent has found
many avenues of expression this
year — Jones and the fraternit-
ies, Goodstein and the drinking
rule, Wooten and ROTC. In the
first two cases the effective ex-
pression of student opinion play-
ed an important role.

There has yet to be an expres-
sion of student opinion about the
requirement of two years of re-
quired military training under
the ROTC program. There are
at least two methods of effec-
tively voicing student opinion
at Davidson College, demon-
strations and petitions.

Since, at Davidson at Jeast,
demonstrations are reserved for
the expression of a desire to
maintain the status quo, it
seems that to effect a change in
the ROTC program a petition
would be more in keeping with
the Davidson tradition. There-
fore, a petition is being circu-
lated requesting the faculty to
take immediate steps to abolish
the requirement of two years of
ROTC.

At the Open End program a
week ago, President Martin
spoke briefly about the ROTC
requirement. At that time, he
said that he was unaware of
anything more than the com-
plaints of a few students about
compulsory ROTC, and that a
few people had complained each
year since 1919, when the pro-
gram was established.

However, he added that if
there ever were a concerted
student effort to have -the re-
quirement abolished. the facul-
ty would give it serious consid-
eration.

The time has come for such a
concerted effort. The student
body can prove for the third
time this year that its opinions
are respected by the facuity and
administration. Any student de-
siring to sign this petition will
find a copy at his fraternity
house or the Union desk. Copies
are also being. circulated by
Cecil Wooten, B. A. Aiken, Clark
Sugg, and myself.

Wooten

Dear Editor:

At Open-End last week Presi-
dent Martin said that one of the
administration's objectives in
requiring all students to take
two years of military training
was to give each student a taste
of military life.

It does indeed seem strange
that the college, which professes
to give each student a )iberal

education, feels that an intro.
duction to military training
should be put on a compulsory
basis whereas art, music, and
philosophy, which are consider-
ed to be an integral part of a
liberal education, should be vol-
untary. ;

It seems to me that the situa-
tion should be reversed. It is jn-
deed a sad commentary on any
liberal arts college that it con-
siders military training more
important to a liberal education
than other courses, such as art,
music, and philosophy, which
are deeply embedded in the
liberal arts tradition.

Dear Editor:

One argument I have heard
in favor of compulsory ROTC
is that Davidson is too small to
support a ROTC program of a
voluntary nature.

Even without recourse to ask-
ing such questions as the pro.
priety of forcing everyone to
take ROTC for the sake of the
minority who wish to go into
the advanced program. or the
value of military training in a
liberal education, I believe this
particular argument can be ef-
fectively countered. °

Defining any school with few-
er than 1500 male undergrad-
uates as comparable to the size
of Davidson insofar as this dis-
cussion is concerned. 1 find no
fewer than twenty-two such in-
stitutions in the “most  selec-
tive.” highly selective,’ and
“very selective’’ categories of
the Comparative Gulde to
American Colleges that are able
to offer optional ROTC.

This list includes such institu-
tions as Bowdoin (811 students),
Colby (761 students), Kenyon
(602 students). Union (1190 stu-
dents). the University of the
South (704 students), and Wash-
ington and Lee (1089 students).

I do not know what sort of
financial arrangement Davidson
has with the United States Army
in regard to compulsory ROTC,
but apparently sacrificing such
revenue (if it exsits) did not
significantly affect the policy of
these twenty-two schools. Of the
twenty-two, only nine have Jarg-
er endowments than Davidson,
and none are state-supported.
Thus they are in no better posi-
tion than Davidson to afford
loss of revenue.

In light of these facts, it
seems to me that Davidson Col-
lege should have little difficulty
in offering a ROTC program on
a voluntary basis, if the admin-
istration so desires.
