With all this, her only com-

Theatre department:

Angela Simms, junior, works
for Dr. Barber. Both she and Dr.
Barber were largely responsible
for the success of the sesquis-
entineal activities during the last
academic year. Her duties in-
clude typing, organizing mailers,
answering the phones, xeroxing
flyers, and handling ticket sales
for the plays. She also gives slide
shows at the visitors center.

One of the things she likes best

of a professor. Working closely
with Dr. Barber has enabled me to
really know him.”

Lake Campus:

Senior John Freeman and jun-
ior Ian Prime are in charge of run-
ning the college's lake campus.
“We take care of all the boats and
docks, lock and unlock every-
thing, rent boats, run sailing
classes, and are in charge of secu-
rity,” said Prime.

The lake campus is almost to-
tally student run, and during the
warm weather is open 2-5 M-F
and 1-5 Sat/Sun.

Both Prime and Freeman came
to Davidson with extensive
knowledge of and experience in
sailing.

Monday, February 20, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

From the library to the lake
campus, Davidson College
employs approximately 275.
students through its work-'
study program. This year, Paul
Marciano, a 1988 Davidson
graduate, has been hired /as an

associate in the human re-

sources department to recom-
mend improvements in the

program.
Work-study jobs are offered

" to students as a portion of their

- financial aid packages. Federal
money funds 80 percent of
these jobs, while the college
pays for the other 20 percent. -
Under Davidson’s present sys-
tem, all jobs pay the federal
$3.35 minimum wage.

According to Marciano,

- however, Davidson is behind
the times. “I don’t know of
another school that pays $3.35 —

across the board,” ‘he said.

“The time has come for a

you mingle with classmates with whom
you have never spoken. You dance, you
mingle, you dance, you mingle, you dance,
you get hot and go out for some air.

Then he kisses you. In that split-second

before it happens you think, “Should I?”

You respond to the question as soon as it’s
asked by “kissing back.” You are attracted
to this boy-since the first day. You‘tiké to
kiss-since the first time. So why that little
question? Why the hesitation? BECAUSE
YOU’VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS
BEFORE, THAT’S WHY. Because you’re
a little afraid to like a Davidson guy.

As you walk to “somewhere private” you
wage war with the little voice in your head:

Little Voice: “Where is all this leading?
He’s going to think you’re easy. The first
date? Your mother would die if‘she...”

Self: “Shut up, I like him. You’re afraid
to live. You judge everybody-maybe this
one is different.” v

Little Voice: “Don’t be a sucker, you
know what’s going to happen and you’re
going to feel like doo-doo when it does.”

Once you get to his room, you kiss him
with a vengeance-partly to block out the
little voice and partly to convince yourself
that this guy is special. ae

He comes by Saturday and you go to the
concert. He’s~ attentive” and affectionate.
He smells good; life is good. You go to the
Union movie that night-he’s a little cooler,

You tell yourself, “People don’t always.
feel like talking, no big deal.”

Afterwards, you attend a_ late-night
party. He’s not as energetic as the previous
evening, but he’s probably just tired. The
party begins to die, so you decide to go
home. You notice that you’re walking

cause you picked your dirty clothes up
from the floor this morning.
You invite him in and you “small talk.”

And then he speaks those dreaded words, “I

have to get up early tomorrow morning so
I better get some sleep.” He thanks you for

a “fun” weekend (gross).

At the very least, you were expecting a
good-night kiss but now you're afraid that
he’s going to shake your hand. Trying to
keep your qyeeckend consistent, you hug

him meaningfully and say, “I really had a

good time.”

He leaves. You feel ill. “Little Voice”
comes out of her shadowy corner and goes
rough on you, “Well that sounded like a
wrap-it-up talk to me. Yes, you were right,
he was very different. This guy started
ignoring you before the date was over-they
usually wait until the day after.”

_ She finally spells it out and you know she
isright. ~

Maybe the trustees curbed dating be-
cause it’s fairly hazardous. You can’t tell .

what the other party is thinking. In fact,

people often act contrary to their feelings.
They think it’s only a couple hours, or a
weekend, and then they'll go back their
books and their extra-curricular activities.
But why send mixed signals? To respond to
a whim? To satisfy curiosity?

The worst part is that from then on, the
two people who ended up “getting
hooked,” pretend not to know each other.

oR 8 quite possible that you’ll become good

friends with an acquaintance you talked to
at the party-mingling opens doors.

But when stuck in the elevator with your
old Mid-Winters date, you'll probably
stare up at'the floor numbers (and Little
Voice will count them out loud, “3-2-1”)
and never say a word. You see, dating can
close doors.
