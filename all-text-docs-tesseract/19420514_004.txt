The leading Kappa Alphas placed three men on the All Fra-
ternity Softball Team as the result of a poll of the sports
managers of each of the nine fraternities and three of the ref-
erees, Davis Thomas, who lost only one game during the
entire season, closed the series by shutting out the Phi Delts
10-0 and was nearly a unanimous choice for the first team posi-
tion. Lacy MacLean, catcher and Jack Richeson, second base
also represented the K. A:’s on the All Star team. John McKin-
non lead in number of votes polled for outfielders, in spite
of the fact that he sustained a leg injury the early part of the
season and only played in a few games. The Phi Gams, and
Kappa Sigs each placed. two men while’ the Pi Kapps, Phi
Delts, and Spees placed one.

Tommy Bumbarger shown for Davidson in the re-
cent Southern Conference Tournament at Winston-
Salem on the old Town course. Bumbarger, was tied
with DeWitt of Duke, and Patton of Wake Forest?for
the lead after the first round each holding a 74. Which
was then better than the tourney winner Poole of
Duke, who was back one stroke. Bumbarger fell off
to an 81 in the afternoon round and lost all chances
of keeping the lead. The golfers had a warm up
match with the team from Washington and Lee and
were defeated 16 to 2.

Apologies and corrections for a misstatement in last week’s
column concerning our illustrious track team. The error that
passed in the night was that N. C. State had won the recent
A, A. U. meet, however I have been correctly informed that
they merely placed second. Though this might detract slightly
from the pleasure of trouncing them in the meet Saturday
a week ago, it was still a good thought. :

The K. A.’s have finished their season with seven

«wins and one loss and are nervously sitting back to see

if the S. A. E.’s can get through their two remaining
games with the SPE’s and Pi Kapps with the pressure
on. The S. A. E.’s havg' only lost to the leading K. A.’s
and will tie them if they can win over these two teams.
The Pi Kapps should and can give them a good battle,
because they have one of the best teams in the league
when they’re on. The Phi Gams who were in second
place last week have lost three while winning one to
finish their season with four won and the same lost.
The Fijis gave the K. A.’s quite a scare in their game
last Friday in which the latter. came from behind
in the last inning to score three runs and tie the score
and finally win it in the extra inning on Jim Jackson’s
home run.

Betas Win

By virtue of an 11-0 decision over
the hapless and winless Phi Delts,
the Kappa Alphas wound up their
schedule Monday, only a loss to the
Betas and Al Winn’s tantalizing
twirling marring an otherwise spot-
less slate. The Betas, however, have
dropped two games and can finish
no better than second.

The Phi Gams, surprisingly strong,
slipped from their threatening po-
sition just back of the K. A.’s when
they came out on the short end of
an eight inning struggle against the
leaders. General Wood’s army of
S. A. E.’s knocked off the Kappa
Sigs, 3-2, and are ready to spring
in a first place tie.
