Professors present list of books for many fields

Editor’s note: In May 1978,
the Center for Special Studies
solicited reading lists from the
Davidson faculty to introduce
students to the various fields of
study offered at Davidson Col-
lege.

The contributors were asked
to recommend three to five
books to readers who know little
or nothing about the different
academic disciplines or speciali-
ties.

Dean of the Center Robert
Avinger wrote The Davidsoni-
an, “The list is an excellent
vehicle for introducing anyone
to a variety of academic fields.

“Students, in particular, may
find in these readings an oppor-
tunity to clarify and broaden
their own intellectual interests
and career plans."

The book list which follows is
the result of Avinger’s survey.
