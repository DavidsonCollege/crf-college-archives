Abbott Takes Honors

In Journalism Awards

By VAN WILLIAMSON
Asst. Features Editor

‘Professor of English Anthony
S. Abbott received the 1974
North Carolina Press

Association Award Jan. 16 for

his weekly column, ‘Penal
Colony,’’ printed in the
Mecklenburg Gazette.

Abbott co-authors ‘‘Penal

Colony’? with Vernon Rich, an
inmate at Central Prison in
Raleigh. ‘‘Penal Colony’’ is a
story of life behind prison walls,
written by one who lives behind
those walls, and one who does
not.

Init, Abbott and Rich have at-

mpted to educate their
readers about the prison
system. ‘‘Penal Colony”’

became the first such circula-

ted column in the nation.

After Rich’s attempted
escape and capture in the
spring of 1974, they continued to
write the column, with Rich
giving his account of life in Cen-
tral Prison in Raleigh, North
Carolfna. Abbott gives much of
the credit for his award to Rich:

“Vernon Rich and I began to
write ‘‘Penal Colony’’ in
November of 1973. We worked
on it reguiarly, mostly at my
house on weekends, through
April of 1974, when Vernon took
an “extended leave’’ and was
picked up in Atlanta. i

‘While he was on escape and
after he had been captured and
returned to Central Prison in
Raleigh, I wrote several col-
umns by myself.

“‘The three columns which
were awarded the prize were
written at this time. Later in the
summer Vernon and I resumed
the writing of ‘‘Penal Colony’’
and plan to continue it as long

as there is material.
“T feel that the award of the
North Carolina Press

Association belongs as much to
Vernon as it does to me, and
that both of us owe a con-
siderable debt to Wister
Jackson, the editor of the
“Gazette”, who has gone out of
his way (quite literally hun-
dreds of miles on some oc-
casions) to help us.”’

Abbott’s columns were

chosen above fifty-one other en-
tries in his division during the
fiftieth annual Newspaper In-
stitute at Chapel Hill; North
Carolina. This is the first such
press award for the ‘“‘Mecklen-
burg Gazette’. :

Judge Gerald L. Gotta,
Associate Professor of Jour-
nalism at the University of
Oklahoma, had great praise for
Abbott’s work:

“The three columns sub-
mitted by Tony Abbott are out-
standing. The topic--‘‘Penal
Colony’’--is, I suspect, not a par-
ticularly easy one to write.

‘“‘However, Abbott has done a
superb job of writing. He has
‘humanized’ the topic and in the
process he has told a moving
story.

‘I don’t recall ever reading
anything that has conveyed to
me the despair and the agony of
prison life as well,as Abbott’s

-columns.

“After reading these three
columns, I felt as if I knew ‘Ver-

non’ as a person. I also felt as
though I were sitting next to Ab-
bott, listening to him tell the
story with an emotion that
seldom comes through in the
written word.

“I guess the highest com-
pliment I can give is to say, ‘]
wish J had written that.’ ”’

Jackson had these words of
appreciation for Abbott’s work:

“We would like to join Mr.
Grotta and the North Carolina
Press Association in extending
our praise for the work that
Tony has done with our paper,
as well as the work and
sacrifices he has made for
prison reform inthis state.

“So often we settle down in
our private worlds and careers,
never. considering the plight
that many of our fellow beings
are laboring under. But Tony
took the time to care by serving
as a community sponsor at Hun-
tersville prison and by helping a
young man towards his writing
career.’

other things with pre-high
school youth from the com-
munity.

Tucker and Yow hope to have
more group activities for STEP
participants than in the past, to
facilitate the exchange of ideas
among STEP ‘tutors’. Group
activities this year have in-
cluded a pumpkin cutting party
and a Christmas party.

‘“My kid introduced me to a
lot of things that I otherwise
wouldn’t have done here. I
would say that I’ve gotten more
out of the program than the kid
may realize now.

“It gives you an. idea about
what you might hve been like
when you were in the fifth or

sixth grade,” Tucker said.

Cunningham hopes that more
women students will sign up to
work with the STEP program so
that the YM/YWCA can reach
more elementary school stu-
dents.

Junior Gary Stewart is
working on plans for a coffee
house in the Depot where junior
high school students can meet.
“Last year I taught boxing at
Ada Jenkins. High school kids
from the community would
show up at the doors,’ ex-
plained Stewart. The high
school students had to be turned
away. -

Stewart acquired a juke box,
and the Senate gave the
YM/YWCA enough money to
buy a pool table for the coffee
house.

Stewart, working with cam-
pus minister Rush Otey and
others, are developing a
schedule for the coffee house. It
probably will open first in the
afternoons and later on will be
open on weekend evenings.

Stewart said that students
from Davidson will be needed to
help staff the coffee house. He
concluded, “It doesn’t take any
special skill; all you have to do
is put in the time.”

ulates Abbott.

... Sexual Awareness Program

Holshouser Congrat-

human sexuality and sex values is a real
possibility. Counselors with professional
training in sex counseling should be con-
sidered for the increased emphasis in

“general counseling. The clinical
facilities of the college should be
examined and their suitability to the
problems and concerns of sex should be
evaluated by trained personnel in the
field.

Such a tri-faceted program (educati-
on, counseling and clinical) has been ad-
opted by Princeton University with
great success both in terms of student
response and meeting student needs.
Their Sex Education Counseling and
health program serves as a model for a
Davidson program. |

In the educational realm, a formal
course in Human Sexuality is needed to
provide not only information, but also

the opportunities for student discussion;

that will enable them to relate to their
self-images.

Such a course could be introduced at
Davidson as an extended studies of-
fering for freshmen and sophmores,
with the possibility of junior and senior

extended studies work in the major
field.

Offered as in interdisciplinary course,
it would deal with the physiological,
psychological, religious, and social
aspects of human sexuality combining
classroom and group discussion
situations.

A topical syllabus for such a course
has been constructed. What is now
needed is cooperation among students,
faculty, and administrators in struc-
turing the course, developing guidelines
for student participation and evaluation
and reworking the syllabus to meet the
demands of Davidson.

In the realm of counseling, the needs
for active sex counseling must be met.
This entails first, assuring oursleves
that such services are available, and

second, publicizing the availability of

such services.
There is an alarmng lack of knowledge
on the part of students as to the services

available in this area. We need to bring .

our counselors into contact with stud-

ents by increased publicity, informal

meetings, and visits to freshmen halls.
No real steps have been taken in this

area, even though this is by far the
easiest of the goals to realize. At the
same time, the Psychological Coun-
seling Service needs to be included in
the planning and implementation of this
program.

The clinical area presents probably
the greatest problem. The infirmary is
doing an adequate job within its struc-

tural, spatial, and policy “limitations.

But are these limitations realistic in
view of the advent of coeducation and in-
creased enrollment?

Our health service needs to be
evaluated by the American College
Health Association as to its suitability in
providing for students’ medical and
sexual needs. Available sevices in the
realm of sexuality (e.g. contraceptive
and gynecological services) need ex-
pansion and greater publicity.

Recognizing the need and value of
such a program, College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr., has expressed
his general agreement with the proposed
program, stating: ‘“‘My response is
favorable.”

Terry, in summing up his feelings
about the program ‘said ‘the major

concern I have is that students and
faculty will approach this matter
seriously, as a legitimate function of a
college like Davidson which has always
prided itself on beng concerned with the
whole person.’’

“Human sexuality is a major part of
personhood,” Terry emphasized.

We must begin now in working to
realize our goals. As we work toward
implementation of a course, and
evaluation of our clinical facilities, two
programs arerealizableintheinterim.  .

First, we can quickly strengthen our
Psychological Counseling Sevice
through increased publicity for staff
members and the services they offer.

Second, : the Resource-Referral ser-
vice, discussed in the Jan. 9 David-
sonian is needed to provide for students’
immediate needs. Information on
human sexuality (for example, con-
traceptive. information) and | in-
formation telling students where they ’
can get help is easy to comply and offer.

It will take a concerted, co-operative
effort over time by students, faculty,
and administrators to realize these
goals. Now is the time to begin.
