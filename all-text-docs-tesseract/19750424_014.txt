IMAC

SIF’s.

Amid much rumor and
speculation, IMAC President
Bryan Andrews resigned today
following the announcement of
the loss of IMAC field #5 to the
‘“Coux Rouge’’ insurgents, (of-
ficial name of the Davidson
towneés.) The loss of this key
field sounded the death knoll for
the much-maligned Andrews
regime.

Andrews’ resignation comes
a little more than two years af-
ter the siging of the Cornelius
Peace Accord. This peace ac-
cord, which was signed in
January, 1973, by Bo Phillips,
representing the SGA, and Tim
Maulden, representing the Coux
Rouge, called. for the with-
drawal of all SGA forces from
the IMAC fields and for a
ceasefire between the IMAC
and townees’ forces.

This agreement was attacked
by SGA hawks who proclaimed
that it did nothing but remove
SGA forces from the fields
without ‘establishing a just and
lasting peace. The doves coun-
tered by saying that an
agreement between the op-
posing forces could not be im-
posed by the SGA, but would
have to be worked out by the
IMAC officials and the Coux
Rouge themselves.

The agreement had no chance
for success as both sides
violated it immediately. The
Coux Rouge gained the upper
hand, but only in the past few
weeks have they been able to
exert themselves and win a
total victory.

As it became evident to IMAC

head Andrews that his supply
lines were over-extended, he or-
dered an evacuation of IMAC
forces from fields #2 and #4, as
they were considered to be the
least valuable. However, the
planned orderly-withdrawal
soon became a rout. Horrified
SGA members watched on TV
as. IMAC referees fought their
way onto official IMAC golf car-
ts, in place of the men and
women refugees for whom the
carts were intended.

This action sparked debate in
the SGA Senate as to who lost
IMAC. The Hawks, lead by
Tony Snow, claimed that the
SGA had abandoned IMAC,
“and if only the SGA had
fulfilled IMAC requests for

money and equipment, they
would still be in non-townee
hands.”

Snow also contends, ‘Since
we abandoned IMAC, we will
have trouble meeting our other
commitments. .I foresee in-
creased townee pressure upon
the laundry.”’
~ Dana English, speaking for
the Senate doves, countered,
“Increased allocations for
IMAC would be useless at this
point. IMAC officials aban-
doned tens of dollars worth of
equipment on the lost fields. We
have no assurance that any
equipment allocated to IMAC at
this time will not end up in
townee hands, just as previous
equipment has. As far as other
SGA commitments, I never
liked the laundry anyway.”

Matters turne” for the worse
later in the we . us field #3 fell
to the insurgents because of An-
drews’ administrative blun-
ders. An irate IMAC official

week, in a demonstration of
frustration over botched IMAC
policies, before surrendering
himself and his equipment over
to Coux Rouge forces. An-
drews’ resignation was
hastened by this display of em-
bitteredness.

IFT, Bongs all suffer defeats

structure could be only a matter
of weeks or even days._

Now for the ‘happy’ news. In
contrast to those IMAC losers,
the rest of this cclumn_ is
devoted to the IMAC winners.

The IMAC: roll call of un-
defeated teams was diminished
by many this week. Emanon Z
lost to the Staten Island Fairies
in a thriller, 15-11; 14-16,6-15.
Emanon, depending on good
teamwork, just fell short to the
more-poised SIF’s, and their
loss creates a three-way tie in
Division III, with the Spe’s
being the other leader.

IFT softball also left the
ranks of the perfect, as did KA
#1. IFT lost a 2-1 game to
Chakras, and the KA’s lost to
the SAE’s. The Beavers, by
bouncing the Bongs, 4-3,
became the only undefeated sof-
tball team, and removed the
Bongs from that status. The
Bongs rebounded by dropping
PDT #1, 2-0, and thus sending
the Delts to third place.

Volleyball still has several
teams -with unmarred records.
IFT continues to waltz through
their ‘‘competition.”” The un-
sung Kerwood Derbies, led by
Alan Duncan and Brian Coffey,
are gaining momentum just in
time for the tourney. The fresh-
men Bongs are still bouncing
along and Phi Gamms have un-
doubtedly backed into their per-
; fect record. A special note: the
field #1, the gym, andthe IMAC___ clinic remained spotless by
office under IMAC control. The defeating the Zoo, 15-5, 10-15, 15-
