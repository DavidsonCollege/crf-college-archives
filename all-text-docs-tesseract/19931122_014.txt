While Davidson College is best known
for the doctors, lawyers, and businessmen
produced, the school has also fielded student-

tive sports on the professional level. There are
currently eight athletes that proudly represent
Davidson in the professional sports world. Of
the eight players, there are five baseball, two
basketball, and one soccer. The baseball play-
ers can be found spread out on different levels
of the farm system, with one major leaguer.
The basketball standouts play in other coun-
tries, while the lone soccer player competes as
a rookie in the professional indoor league.
BASEBALL
*Robert Eenhorn (’90) plays for the AA
Albany Yankees. He was drafted by the New
York Yankees in the second round of the 1990
amateur draft after playing one season for
Davidson. After completing his first year’ in
AA inthe Eastern Leagueat shortstop, Eenhorn
put up excellent numbers and is being consid-
ered for a promotion to AAA Columbus next
fall. He was named to the Eastern League All-
Star team and was voted the best defensive
infielder. To add to his resume, Eenhorn was
selected as one of 20 players invited to the
organization’s winter instructional league.

*Alan Lewis (’88) spent his 1992 season with

Brewers. The 27 year-old Lewis played 3rd
base and DH for the Diablos in the Texas
League. Unfortunately, he was released at the
end of the season but will most likely be
picked up by another organization in the spring.
Interestingly, Lewis was married this past
year at the ballpark in a homeplate ceremony
to a secretary he met while in the L.A. Dodger
organization.

Playing in the outfield, Masse had his best year
in the pros. He was unanimously selected as an
International League All-Star. Surprisingly,

eAndy Paul (’93) made a big impression in his
first year with the Brewers. After starting in the
Instructional Arizona League with the Chan-
dler Brewers, Paul was quickly promoted to A
Beloit in the Midwest League. The right handed
pitcher signed with Milwaukee as a free agent
following his junior season at Davidson, and
was allowed to graduate before competing. At
Beloit, Paul posted a career best 2.96 ERA.
Through the season, he had three scoreless
streaks of 8.67, 10 and 13 innings, and racked
up 12 strikeouts in a start versus Ft. Wayne in

August. The Brewers were impressed enough
to select Paul as one oi 3 players to compete in
the Australian Winter League. The organiza-
tion has set him up with housing, food, a car,
and $1,500 a month in spending money. If his
numbers stay low, Davidson should see Paul
at AA Stockton in the California League in
1994.

Football legend Howell goes out with a bang

By Neil Marks
A celebrated Davidson foot-
ball career came to a close last
Saturday as senior quarterback
Richard Howell led the Wildcats
* toa55-14 trouncing of Bridgewater
on Richardson Field.

Determined to go out with a
bang, Howell scored a school
record 26 points off of four touch-
*down runs and a two point conver-
sion. He also set seasonal marks
with 18 touchdowns and 110 total
points while finishing with 5,256
career. yards, making him
Davidson’s all-time offensive
leader.

At one point Howell wasn’t
even considering playing for
Davidson; he had decided to play
baseball for Wake Forest.

“T had a couple of offers from
other schools but I was seton Wake
Forest. I wasn’t even going to look
,, here but a friend of mine was com-

ing down and convinced me to
look at it,” said: Howell.

“The thing that impressed me
the most was that the coaches
seemed to really care about what I
wanted--not like at the other places
I looked. The atmosphere and
friendliness of the entire campus
helped me decide, also,” he ex-
plained.

Howell became an immediate
asset to the team, starting five
games as a freshman; he has been
the team’s regular starter ever since.

When asked the reasons for
such a remarkable career, Howell

.was quick to spread the credit.

“My linemen, who don’t get
the credit they deserve, did a good
job blocking for me all year, and
the defense always gave us great
field position,” he explained.

Howell is excited about the
new found enthusiasm the campus
has shown for the team and

Davidson football in general.

“When I first got here I was
disappointed in the lack of support
for athletics--there really wasn’t
any--but the attitude on campus
and in the community is improv-
ing. It was great this year to have
people come out to pep rallies and
support us,” he said.

Not only a phenomenal ath-
lete, Howell is involved in other
campus activities such as the BSC
and the pre-med society. The most
rewarding to him, however, is the
big-buddy program with the local
elementary school.

“Eventhough I’m nota super-
star like Charlie Ward, the kids
look up to me since I’m an athlete.
Some of them don’t do that well in
school but I’ve seen them improve.
To be able to touch their lives like
that is a very rewarding experi-
ence,” he said.

Howell believes that football

is more than just a game and is an
important character builder.

“Itmakes you believe in your-
self. It creates a huge bond with the
team since you push each other so
hard. It teaches you that you have
to work hard. It teaches you that
you have to work hard in your life
because nothing is going to come
easy,” Howell explained.

Wake Forest’s loss was defi-
nitely Davidson’s gain, and Howell
himself couldn’t have been hap-
pier with the outcome.

“I’ve made the best friends
I’ll ever have. It’s been an incred-
ible four years--I have no regrets.”

The senior from Bladenboro,
North Carolina will be missed as
the Cats attempt to better this year's
6-4 mark. Howell now plans to
take a year off to explore the pos-
sibilities of playing professionally
and if not go to graduate or med
school.

Chess finds
college's
champions

By Staff Writers

On November 13, the chess
club sponsored the First Annual
Davidson College Chess Champi-
onship, and John Ballard came
away as the 1993 Davidson Col-
lege Chess Champion. Eight com-
petitors participated in the four-
round event.

Ballard, a former U.S. Junior
Champion, and Doitch Kraser, the
1993 North Carolina Class D
Champion, were the top two seeds
in the event. The third round pro-
vided the deciding game of the
tournament as Ballard defeated
Kraser in a hard fought match.

While Ballard finished with
an undefeated 4-0 record, Kraser
and freshman Stephen Eckmantied
forsecond with identical 3-1 marks.
However, Kraser received the sec-
ond place plaque on tiebreaks due
to his first-round victory over
Eckman. Rounding out the top
four was senior Stephen Hill. Hill,
who finished the tournament at 2-
2, playedimpressively, losing only
to Ballard and Kraser.

The top four finishers of
Ballard, Kraser, Eckman, and Hill
will represent Davidson College at
the Pan American Intercollegiate
Chess Championships in Deland,
Florida this December. Ballard
believes that Davidson has a very
strong team that should be com-
petitive. The Pan American is a
prestigious tournament which has
been in existence for almost fifty
years and is the pinnacle of inter-
collegiate chess.

Also competing in the
Davidson Championship were
Stephen Feeley, and freshmen Tho-
mas Wang, Daniel Ruggiero, and
Bill Slusser. Feeley placed fifth
overall and received the top fac-
ulty plaque since no faculty mem-
bers competed in the event.

According to Ballard, the tour-
nament was a success. Since the
club is still in its first semester of
existence, eight competitors was a
fine turnout. Half of the competi-
tors were freshmen, which speaks
well for the future of Davidson
chess.

The club has also set up a
chess ladder to rank Davidson chess
players. Anyone who would like to
be included in the chess ladder
needs only to send the results of
games played to John Ballard at
x6242. Regular chess club meet-
ings are every Thursday night at
9:30.
