Official Policy

With the start of a new year and
with several hundred new faces on
campus it becomes valuable, if not
necessary, for THE DAVIDSONIAN to
redefine its policy as a campus news-
paper.

First, perhaps it would be best to
make perfectly clear what THE DA-
VIDSONIAN. is rot. We are not the
official news organ for anyone. We
are not the “news and editorial voice
of Davidson College” nor can we be
called the “news and editorial voice
of the Davidson College student
body.” Neither can it be said that
THE DAVIDSONIAN in any official
way seeks to represent Davidson and
its activities to the outside world.

We are a campus newspaper with a
journalistic obligation to print the
news of Davidson,,College. Not an of-
ficial version of the news. Not a
biased version of the news. Just the
news. -

It‘ might seem that we are grossly
overstating our point, but in the light
of recent criticism, comment and
misunderstanding about our work we
fee] it is necessary to publicly rede-
dicate ourselves to that position.

On our news pages we strive for
accuracy and fairness. If there are

It almost seemed that again the
forces of dark and evil were about to
visit an abomination upon the forces
of goodness and light by visiting all
the dorm rooms in search of outlaw
refrigerators. Any refrigerator over
50 watts would be supsect.

Seriously, the latest edict on refrig- .

erators coming in the form it did
‘seemed a bit hard to take.

What was badly needed was a
little more communication on the sub-
t. Why was the limit at 50 watts?
as the effort one in fact to limit the
amount of food storage a student
may have in conjunction with the ef.
fort to limit cooking in the dorms?

Was the wattage restriction based on
the economic problems of running
all those student refrigerators? Or
was the restriction based on the tech-
nical problem. of providing electrici-
ty to run all those refrigerators?

We really could not answer those
questions. Why not, you ask. Because,
boys and girls, what we had here
is a failure to communicate.

We must thank the housing office
for working to compromise on the
issue. Now perhaps no one will be
hurt by the sudden restriction. It
does seem, however, that the first
communication should have carried
a little more information of the sort
suggested above and beyond the bare
facts of the restriction. As it was,
a major campus controversy was
about to brew over refrigerators of
all things.

Seriously once again, it must be
remembered that many of the ill
feelings between students, adminis-
tration, and faculty last spring could

two sides to a controversy, -we will
work to present both. But editorially
we aré\our own voice.

We oy even covet, opposing
points of ‘view to be expressed in
letters to the editor. Our columns
will strive to present a wide range
of opinions.

It must be remembered, however,
that the opinions expressed by the
columnists do not necessarily* repre-
sent those of the editor. The column-
ists are given cgnsiderable freedom
of expression so that their columns
are personal rather than expressions
of any official DAVIDSONIAN -atti-
tudes.

Nominally the editorials are the
public opinions of the editor and his
associates. But actually they are more
than that. They are part of the tradi-
tion of journalism on this campus
which has sought and still’ seeks to

print the news but at the same time ,

to raise hell about it when we think
it nécessary.

It is not that we can claim authori-
ty by virtue of expressing opinions
in printed matter. Merely we are
part of the ‘willingness to contem-
plate what is happening” which has
marked this paper, and journalism,
from the beginning.

Conflict ~

have been avoided if each “side” had
known the reasons for the decisions
reached by the other parties in the
various discussions.

Now the refrigerator restriction is
really a picayune editorial subject
except that it is a source of conster-
nation to many students who own re-
frigerators and to many more who
see it as an example of the kind of
unexplained dealings they do not
wamt from our administrators.

Something more than an 1l1th
hour letter of restriction is needed
in broaching an issue of such popular
concern.

Afid while we are’ on a. pitiful sub
ject like refrigerators, may we sug-
gest that the SGA, or some
other quasi-official body seriously

consider renting refrigerators to stu-
dents.

Successful rental programs have
now been established at several area
colleges including UNC - Charlotte,
Wake Forest, UNC - Greensboro, and
N. C. State. Details of operation are
only a phone call away.

In addition to being quite popular,
the rentals have proven in some cases
to be good money raisers for scholar-
ships or .speaker funds.

It’s just a thought, but we would
like to see someone consider it.

Self-Scheduling

Among the many proposals for
campus and academic change which
were being debated at the end of
last spring was included self-schedul-
ed exams. And it is quite significant
to us that on this issue at least ad-
ministrative action was positive.

Even more significant is the action
of the Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) in placing the issue high on
its agenda for this fall. We would
like also to encourage the EPC to
reach an early conclusion as to a

B. Cc.

mechanism for self-scheduled exams
to allow the faculty plenty of: time
for debate of the subject before the
fall exam period.

Always in the back of our minds
is the hope that this time for sure
students will have a chance to try
the much discussed exam system.
The approval of the principle by the
EPC last spring deserves the students’
thanks. But a chance to actually try
the system would indeed be cause for
real gratitude.

contention that a school sys-

The results of the school

We are counting on college
groups to do most of the
jocal work. Here are some
“possible approaches for or-
ganizing the boycott:

1. Contact local clergy —
many should be receptive to
taking commercialism out
of Christmas and _ putting
peace back in.

2. Organize picket lines at
department stores and shop-
ping centers.

3. Do guerilla theater on
the sidewalk in front of
large stores. Dramatize the
horrors of war or the con-
tradictions in the thinking of
the military.

4. Leaflet at high schools,
train stations, churches and
shopping centers.

5. Urge fellow students not
to go home for vacation un-
less their Parents agree to
participaté in the boycott.

We would welcome any
criticisms and suggestions
readers might have of this
proposal.

By PAUL

BEELIE E PT Meee?

In Search Of A

Whiting a column the first week of school is
no mean task. Slick Sam hasn’t had time to make
an ass of himself and other victims for scathing com-
mentary have been well behaved as well, (or at least
their errors have been understandable).

Y thought of writing one of those “Dear Fresh-
men” essays on Davidson dip newcomers need to
know, but Cullum Rogers beat me to that in the
Wildcat Handbook. The main thing he omitted was
a list of phrases to bolster your points and impress
your peers in class, such as: “While Rereading Kant
last night it occured to me that...” :

ip/case someone is fool enough to argue with you,
try “Well, I think if you'll examine the text more
closely . . .” then hit them with page references. .

If all else fails to correct the misguided soul,
you can always concede “Well, there MAY be some-
thing in what you say, but... .” and imply that there
probably isn’t anything to your challenger’s view.

I thought of doing something on ROTC, but
then that’s all in the Handbook too. The ROTC de-
partment says they produce officers and that they’ll
pay you handsomely if you’re willing to be produced.

On the pro side of ROTC, Tom Rogers subtly
reminds you of the draft and poses the probing
question: if you’ve got to kill, would you rather be
told to or tell others? On the other hand John Mc-
Lean observes that ROTC isn’t Christian and still
isn’t fun. What more can you say?

I thought of composing. an eloquent essay chal-
lenging ee Class of '74 to not fall into the apostle-
hood of the apathetic, a Davidson tradition sadly
unlikely to be deserted. Besides, who cares?

I thought of digging into local issues by tell-
ing you of summer experiences ‘such as meeting
CPA-sponsored, school board member-elect Jane
Scott who spoke to a seminar on urban problems.
She cited dozens of “crying needs,” began every-
other sentence with “however” and avoi entire-
ly the question of how other than bussing, could
schools be racially balanced or the question of why
students of all colors and classes should not get as
good an education as those in the affluent, south-
eastern quadrant of the Queen City. After all, some
of her best friends .. . ;

Or I could tell you of the bus driver who grin-
ned as he wheeled his city bus dangerously near two
pedestrian black women and wished “They ought
to open season on ’em;” niggers that is. An agree-
able passenger opined “if one. race has to go it
might as well be them.”

But then, it is easier to belittle such people as
rednecks and honkies than it is. to deal with them

as people.

President Nixon’s speech at Kansas State of-
fered opportunity for comment on national issues.
Admid praise for Kansas athletics, Tricky Dick
actually said something worthwhile. It was on the
order of, “violence and terror have no place in a
civilized society.”

What amazes me «is not that insight but the
President’s inability to see war as violent.

Both Presidents Nixon and Spencer have spoken
of dissent in terms of ‘the rule of reason rather
than force’ but there are occasions when :reason-
able force is called for to stop greater atrocities of,

say, our. activity in Vietnam or
