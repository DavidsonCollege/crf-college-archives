NOTICE TO WRITERS OF
DAVIDSONIAN ARTICLES

Below are given some of the most im-
portant instructions and suggestions for
writing articles for The Davidsonian.
It is hoped that these will be preserved
by all reporters and others who are call-
ed upon from time to time to write spe-
cial articles for the paper. By follow-
ing these suggestions one can gain con-
siderable experience in newspaper writ-
ing, and also relieve the editors of con-
siderable unnecessary work.

1. Typewrite all articles, if possible.

2. Write legibly and leave a good
space between each line.

3. Remember that one -article on
time is worth ten behind time)

4. Leave a wide margin at the top
of the paper so that headlines may be
put in by the managing editor. Don’t
try to headline your article.

THINGS TO BE AVOIDED.

5. Don’t use “we” in an article.
That is the editor’s privilege.

6. Don't fail to put an alumnus’
year of graduation when you mention
one. Thus: A. B. Brown, ‘07. Or if
he was not graduated with the class of
which he was a member, thus: John
Jones, ex-'11. Don’t use parentheses,
only commas.

7. Don’t use long, involved sentences.
In newspaper writing one short, concise
‘clear sentence is worth three long ones.

8. Don’t forget to begin your article
with the most important incident or the
most important phase of the article that
you are writing. .

9. Don’t put a person’s initials after
his name, but J. F. Jones, not, Jones, J.

to. Don’t use abbreviations, but
write out all words.

11, Don’t forget that you are a re-
porter, that this means business, and that
you are expected to “have a nose” for
news all of the time, and to turn in any
items that you find to the Assignment
Editor, so that he can have them cov-
ered,

12. Don't fail to read when you
have a chance, some of the library books
on journalism.

-13. Don’t forget that good, punctual.
earnest work will put you on The
Davidsonian staft.

PROGRESS IS BEING MADE
BY COMPANIES AT DRILI

General Foch, could he have taken a
few hours from European affairs and
visited the drill field here last week
would have seen a sight that would have
interested and puzzled even him, season-
ed strategist that he is. Squad after
squad from the different companies of
the S. A. T. C. solemnly lined up at
one end of the football field and as sol-
emnly walked off to the opposite end,
walking with a glassy stare and mechani-
cal step, But, no, gentle reader, they were
not sleep walkers, just soldiers pacing
off the hundred yards to use as a stand-

ard for determining estimated distances.

Then Lieut. Sullivan pointed out sev-|.

eral objects and estimations were made.
In some cases very good results were
secured. ‘The correct estimating of dis-
tance is a necessary quality in good shots
and the fellows are urged to practice the
habit of estimating and pacing distances.

In close order drilling the progress has
been very good. In view of the fact that
there has been but about three weeks of
drill the companies are showing up un-
usually well. All the squad movements
and practically all the company move-
ments are executed daily.

The lack of guns has, of course, handi-
eapped the bayonet drill, or killing, as
it should be termed. Nevertheless the
company commanders have explained the
principal movements and with the ar-
rival of guns immediate action may be
begun.

So far there seems to be little to
choose between the four companies.
Company A, however, has the distinction
of having in its ranks the highest rank-
ing officer, General Hall.

Not forgetful of the fact that David-
son is a training school for officers, each
company commander has_ been ‘ giving
two lectures weekly, based on Moss’
Military Manual and the Infantry Drili
Regulations.

LT. EVERETT BOOE, '12,
RETURNS FROM FRANCE

Lieut. Everett Booe, 12, after a short
visit at his home here in Davidson, left
the first of this week for Camp Gordon.
Many of the townspeople and the stu-
dents remember Everett Booe as the star
athlete and captain of the football team.

Lieutenant Bove received his commis-
sion as second lieutenant a year ago at
Fort Oglethorpe, and went to France
last May. He was in active service from
May. until. the 1st of October, and re-
ceived his first lieutenant’s commission
the last of August. During his period
of active service, Lieutenant Booe says
that he fought in the open, and was not
in the trenches at all. In spite of this, he
escaped without a wound. During the
last of September, Lieutenant Booe re-
ceived orders to report back to the Unit-
ed States, and started back the first of
this month. He will be stationed at
Camp Gordon as instructor in trench
mortars.

“Y" WORK IS OUTLINED
IN CHAPEL ADDRESS

In a brief talk to the students last
Friday morning Mr. James A. G.

Moore outlined the work that the Y.|-

M. C. A. would do this year. In part,
he said: .

“When men enter army life, they
come face to face with many new condi-
tions and difficulties. The influences of
the home, the church, and the Sunday
School are largely done away with and
the soldier must face vital issues by him-
self. It is here that the Y. M. C. A.
endeavors to help a man by keeping him
in touch with his home, his church, and
most of all, with God.”

The gymnasium is to be the “Y”

building. The room to the right has
been fitted up with a victrola, magazines.
games, etc. There is also a good bit of
athletic material which the fellows are
urged to use.

The religious work of the Y. M. C.
A. will consist of a meeting every Sun-
day evening at 6:45 and the Sunday
morning Bible classes, meeting at 10
o'clock. The book to be studied is one
written for the soldiers by a man who
is now in the army. It is “The Soldier
Spirit,” by Geo. Stewart. .

Remember that victory belongs to
those who can hold out a quarter of an
hour longer.

ANSWER TO
CORRESPONDENTS

COMPANY FUNDS ARE
TO BE ESTABLISHED HERE

“Can you state, in this department of
your valued paper, some of the college
traditions which a new-comer ought to
know? TIMID FRESHMAN.”

* * e

Once upon a time, there were some
college traditions, Timid; but they were
all shot to pieces before you came on.
You need have no fear of innocently
breaking any of the ancient laws of the
academic zone by saying ‘How do you
do?” to the wrong person, or sitting on
the wrong bench, or wearing the wrong’
kind of a hat. We aren’t giving a hang
about such things, just now.

Act like a he-man, and use your judg-
ment; that’s all. The best account you
can give of yourself, is to keep smiling!
If you are uncomfortable, grin! If the
sergeant jolts your sensibilities, cheer!
lf the military proctor gets your goat,
let him have it; there are more goats to
be had. The college had gone to war—
all of it—lock, stock, and barrel !

Attend everything that looks like a
patriotic meeting. Give your old duds
to the Belgians. Save up your cash for
the United War Work Compaign
Fund. The college students led the
country, last year, in donations to these
movements—now combined for one big
drive in November.

Until we can get into the fight, our-
selves, let’s do our best to brace up the
other fellows who are in it. Any stu-
dent who finishes this academic year
with money in his trousers, has somes
thing wrong under his vest.

We used to chaff the chap who was
tighter’n an old tire on a rusty rim; now
we despise him. “Raus mit him!” (He
can understand that sentence, being part
Boche).

So, don’t be timid, Timid, about any-

The question of establishing a pdst-
exchange or canteen on the campus for
the use of the local S. A. T. C. was de-
liberated upon for some time, but finally
it was decided instead to use Elliott's,
Jetton and White Drug Companies to-

_

gether as a post exchange. Each store
has issued tickets which Lieutenant Den-
nard has alloted to those desiring them.
The object of this is to give a student
credit at these stores, his bills being sub-
tracted from his pay at the end of the
month. A commission will be granted
by the stores on the products sold, which
commission will go into a company fund,
used as a council of.three officers sees fit.
The men will carry their cards about
with them and they will be punched at
the stores as they make their purchases.
Up to Monday night a large number
of the cards had been issued to the stu-
dents.

ice,” Moss; “Manual of Military] thing but grounchiness and stinginess.
Training,” Moss; “Private’s Manual,’ | The only offenses you can possibly com-
Mass. mit, this year, are soreness and tightness.
