Movie Review

Get Shorty
and a little
Hollywood
Magic, too

By Ep ACLE
Movie Critic

Finally, after weeks of intense
suffering, a good movie has come
out. After painfully sitting through
Assassins, then following that up
with the torture of The Scarlet Let-
ter, | was beginning to wonder
why I ever volunteered to become
a movie critic. Get Shortyreminds
me why.

The plot of the film is fairly
convoluted, because it is a tangle
of different motives and subplots,
therefore making it comically con-
fusing.

Much has all ready been writ-
ten about how this movie seems to
be a Pulp Fiction rip-off. These
critics point to the seemingly inane
conversations between the main
characters, the sudden explosions
of violence, and John Travolta play-
ing yet another hood (and shows us
that his prior performance was no
fluke).

What many don’ trealize, how-
ever, is that Tarantino’s style bor-
rows heavily from Elmore Leonard
(who wrote Get Shorty in 1990,
back when Tarantino was still in a
video store). The comparisons be-
tween the two films are deserved
and carry added benefits — if
people are driven to see Get Shorty
because of its similarity to Pulp
Fiction, maybe some of them will
read some of Elmore Leonard’s
other wacky novels.

Part of Get Shorty’s brilliance
lies in its dismantling of Holly-
wood. The hoods in the film know
how to operate in this world of
glitter and gloss because it’s not all
that different from where they
came.

Various characters in Holly-
wood, from Roger Corman to
Dustin Hoffman (who is not to be
confused, by the way, with Andy
Roark), have their parallels in the
film.

Even as it gently pokes fun at
the industry, however, Get Shorty
displays a true affection for films
(such as the scene where Chili
watches an old film by himself).

Get Shorty isn’ ta perfect film.
Its greatest strength, the convo-
luted plot, is also its greatest weak-
ness as it leaves several subplots
dangling in the end. Sometimes
the characters are just a bit too
goofy.

As I left the theater, however,
these seemed like small complaints.
For two hours I forgot all else, as
lost in my theater as Chili was in
his. As I drove home I finally
realized that, as the film suggests,
Hollywood hasn’t quite lost all of
its magic just yet.

Grade: A-

Juggling, Joking, a

By Curisty SHI
Staff Writer

Italian cuisine takes on a new
meaning after seeing the Fettucini
Brothers. This juggling comic duo
kept the 900 Room alive with
laughs Saturday night, flinging
jokes into the audience as juggling
clubs flew across the stage. For
jugglers and the coordination-im-
paired, this event was a special
treat.

Although their jokes ran the
gamut from Prozac to hillbillies,
the Fettucini Brothers drew the
most laughs with their subtle (and
often not-so-subtle) bathroom and
body humor. Such comments as
“No need to applaud, obviously”
(to a silent crowd) and “I’m sweat-
ing like a Kennedy on the stand,”
appealed to even the most proper
senses of humor. However, such
comments as “Save the schmeckel”
and “Let’s get it on; no, let’s just

juggle” displayed their true colors.

Also displaying his colors was
junior Macon Stokes, who in a
patriotic shirt bravely stood by and
helped the jolly jugglers to mount
their unicycles (although the
mounting of members of the audi-
ence was discussed). Several other
students braved the stage as volun-
teers and laughed as the audience
laughed at them.

Forcing ping pong balls from
their mouths to act as mallets, the
Fettucini Brothers played “Mary
Hada Little Lamb” on xylophones.
This display of musical talent was

Room.

funny as well as extremely impres-
sive. But the show-stealer was the
juggling of flaming torches. “A
couple of flaming heterosexuals,”
Sean and Steve calmly tossed the
firesticks through the air, pausing
to throw in their own rendition of
Joan of Arc. Their scorching satire
burned far more dangerously than
those fiery batons.

Who are the Fettucini Broth-

ers? Besides being acomedy team
not to be missed, Sean and Steve
are Charlotteans who discovered
their talents nearly eight years ago.
Both men were working in a Char-
lotte restaurant and discovered their
common interest: juggling. Asthey
practiced together, the potential for
a routine became apparent. The
Fettucini Brothers came into exist-
ence and have been seen on the

Comedy Channel, as well as many
college campuses in the southeast.

Sean gave credit to Bill Giduz,
director for news and photography
in College Relations (and editor of
a juggling publication), for sup-
porting the Fettucini Brothers over
the years. He did their first photo-
shoot; their common passion for
juggling has resulted in a long-
lasting friendship.

Twelfth Night begins new day for Shakespeare

By Court McBryDE
& Amy ROLFES
Guest Writers

A second row seat in Hodson
Hall opened our eyes to the con-
temporary world of Shakespeare’s
Twelfth Night. The French Italian
Riviera of the 1930s, whichis quite
a change from Shakespeare’s
scripted Italy, was the setting for
the love struggles of an eclectic
group of socialites.

Immediately, the intentions of
Director Alex Pinkston were re-
vealed in the playbill: “As
Shakespeare consistently demon-
strated, it is not enough simply to
relocate stories, or to bring them in
line with contemporary expecta-
tions. It is also important to find a
new context that works for all the
qualities inherent in the text.”

This group of actors and ac-
tresses successfully achieved this
goal. They proved that a 17th
century Renaissance drama can be
translated into a contemporary
world, showing that Shakespeare
transcends time. The comedy of
the production exceeded our ex-
pectations.

I have heard from other play-
goers that the danger of this pro-
duction lied in the excising of lines
from and addition of lines to
Shakespeare’ s original script; how-

ever, we did not feel that this hin-
dered the play in any manner.
The play opens with Countess
Olivia (Carrie Van Deest) and Feste
(Ben. Summers) dancing a rather
comical tango, setting the prece-
dent for the element of dance and
music that pervaded the play. For
example, whenever Maria and her
entourage concocted a deceitful
plan they danced a jig. The comic
elements of this play were defi-
nitely emphasized and sometimes
taken to an extreme, keeping in
line with the Shakespearian tradi-

tion and style.

One of the funniest scenes was.

the Three Stooges-like act Toby
Belch, Fabiano, and Sir Andrew
Aguecheek performed while spy-
ing on Malvolio. The actors of this
scene were at their best in bringing
the audience. to roaring laughter.
Once again Ron Higdon pulled
through in creating a stage with a
triptych effect that was unusual,
yet highly functional. It revealed

the high seas world of Orsino,

Countess Olivia’s 12th Night Club
and house. The night club doubled

as the front porch of Olivia’s house.

And, of course, they did not
forget to emphasize the sexual
overtones which Shakespeare in-
cluded in the original text. Orsino
was quite explicit in his interest
towards Cesario and visa versa. Of
course none of the men were afraid
tothrust their pelvis acoupletimes,
usually in the direction of a young
lady.

As always Feste, the come-
dian — or shall I say the fool —
gets the last word. Shakespeare
would have been proud!
