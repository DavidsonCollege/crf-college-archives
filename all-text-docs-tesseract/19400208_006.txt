its being bigger the groups,
bigger than the offices, and bigger

And

since

that bigness seems to!

ple and its workings are the same.

I have already expressed my op-
inion of the plan to publicly par-
ade the particulars pertaining to
the several candidates. That is cer-
tainly contrary to the friendliness
that we at Davidson are so justly
proud- of;

Now as to the actual method of
casting ballots, that can be improv-
ed. Last year we had a few plans
under inspection, but we failed to
agree

on any one best procedure.

There could be one central ballot-
ing place so that all the students
could cast their votes for a certain

group of non-overlapping offices
at the same time and 6m the same
baltot on a particular election day. |

Voting in person at a booth, say
in Chambers, would eliminate the
absentee ballot complaint, it would
place voting more completely under
Council survelliance and control
and would reduce the strained and
tedious period of elections by about
half. It make voting more
of a personal ballot, with more in-
dividual initiative needed, and would
stop the practice of peeping and

1.7 Average Made

Last year at the end of the
second semester the scholastic
average of the entire student
body was found to be 1.7, or
approximately C-plus.. At the
same time the average of the
N. Y. A. work was found to be
1.9, a difference of two tenths
of _a point.

Of the one hundred and four-
teen approved men on the N. Y.
A. roll, not one was dismissed
from school on account of scho-
larship at the close of the first
semester. Any man who fails in
two subjects is dropped from
the N. Y. A. rolls, on a govern-
ment rule. This evidence, Prof.
F. K. Fleagle, N. Y. A. director,
declared, points to the fact that
the N. Y. A. men do not neglect
as they continue
to be on a par with or even bet-
ter than the average student
