SCRURS SUFFER DEFEAT
IN TWO GAMES

On last Wednesday night the David-
son Scrubs were again defeated by the
fast Winston-Salem High School quint,
on the Winston floor, by the overwhelm-
ing score of 52 to 10. Notwithstanding
the score, the game was not a one-sided
affair altogether. The Scrubs fought
every minute of the time, but were un-
able to do anything against the strong
defense of their opponents, or to break
up the spectacular shots of the Winston
forwards. Both teams showed a lack of
team work and the game was featured
thruout with long shots. The Win-
ston hoys caged the ball from every angle
of the court, and altho lacking team
work, were able to pile up a big score on
the Scrubs.

For the Scrubs there were no special
stars, but all those who got in the game
plaved a hard game in the face of defeat.

The line-up was as follows:

MOORESVILLE GAME.

On Thursday night the Srubs were
defeated by the Mooresville quint by the
score of 30 to 29. In the first half the
Scrubs were decidedly off color, and al-
lowed their opponents 22 points to their
12. In the second half, however, they
came back strong and by some fast team
work succeeded in ending the game only
one point behind their opponents. The
game was rough and both teams had
numerous fouls called. For the Scrubs
Douglas and McAlister played the best
ball. Stafford played the best game for
Mooresville.

be considered merely for the purpose of
reading paralleled to certain studies, but
as a priceless treasure for the benefit of
all who thirst for knowledge. One may
find there books dealing with thousands
of topics, history, biography, poctry, lit-
erature, politics, oratory, travel, debate,
science, religion, art, languages, law, and
many others all of which are tremend-
ously important. Picture to yourself two
types. A boy who, having finished his
classes rambles to the store to buy a
“dope,” then takes a few pitches at the
crack, dances awhile, visits about ten
other boys until supper, probably hin-
dering someone from studying. Another
boy, as soon as he has finished his classes,
takes a short run and then goes to the
library, reads timely articles and a few
chapters in some book that will be an
asset to him. Draw conclusions — for
yourself. as to the one that will more
easily make a success out of life. A young
man entering college, if he would spend
two-thirds of his spare time reading
standard novels by such men as Dickens,
Hawthorne, Thackery, Huge. Maupas-
sant and Scott, in his Freshman year,
then in his Sophomore year take up his-
tory and biography and so on thru
art. travel, literature, etc.. this is the
man who would be truly educated.
