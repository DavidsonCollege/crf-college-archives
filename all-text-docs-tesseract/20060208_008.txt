RSC exposed as Rural Shakespeare Company

After a thorough investigation
by CCRL and SGA senators, a com-
mittee of students has accused the
college administration of duping
the student body.

The students claim that instead
of bringing in the Royal
Shakespeare Company, to
campus, the administra-
tion hired a different RSC:
the Rural Shakespeare
Company’ of Jackson, §
Mississippi. ‘

The Rural Shakespeare
Company, who also per-
formed Two Gentlemen of
Verona and Caesar last
year, was exposed during
their teaching residency
this semester.

Jennifer Reed ’08 was %
one of the students who
blew the whistle on the
imposters.

how great our British accents was,
and asked if we wouldn’t mind
speakin’ em all along,” said
Willerby. “We figured it’d be
mighty good practice for we actors
and such.”

While most students were sur-
prised and disappointed
by the announcement of
the fraud, others suspect-
ed the deception as soon
the “RSC” first arrived.

“I started getting suspi-
cious when the college
greeted the RSC with a
line dancing reception in
Chambers Gallery and a
pig-picking outside the
Alvarez Union for dinner,”
said Trey Moore ’07.

“One of the opening
workshops was entitled
‘The Bard in the Barn:
Reading Shakespeare at
the Seminoles’ Halftime’,”
said Jeremy Skye ’o6. “I
thought it was kind of an
odd subject for an British
company, especially when

one of the actresses invit-

with her. She offered to

with one flat tire and a deer carcass
in the bed.”

“We crossed the South Carolina

The company, admitted last
week that they were not, in fact,
British, but were faking their
accents all along.

RSC Representative Peggy Sue
Willerby said it was the college’s
idea to pretend to be English.

“Mr. Union Board director said

Members of the Rural
Shakespeare Company
seem to be relieved that

they’ve finally been exposed.

“Now we can finally get some
respect from these college folk
‘stead of dem thinkin’ it was dem

Dawes. “Plus, we was havin’ trou-
ble making Edith and Clancy fit the

English professor admits he deserved award

Much to the delight of the

Miliken with the Leo Kosmonov
Fiction Award. He took the pic-
ture himself with a camera timer.

Davidson College community,
James P. Godwin Professor of
English Jerry Miliken has recently
been awarded the prestigious Leo
Kosmonov Fiction Award, given
annually for a collection of full-
length short fiction stories.

Miliken’s ‘ collection, “Shark
Sandwich: Tales From a Seafood
Apocalypse,” has received rave
reviews, beating out over 700
other collections to be named this

- year’s winner.

Miliken’s work, delving into the
transcendental minds and migra-
tory nature of sharks as indicative
of the fate of modern society, will
be published this coming year. The
award will bring him an advance
on a new series of fiction, tenta-
tively titled “Led Zeppelin III.”

“Jerry Miliken is extremely
proud of himself, and God sure
knows he should he,” said _Miliken
of the success of his work. “Jerry
Miliken has been praising himself
for years, and now people have
recognized his total awesomeness
and humilty. This award is merely
a sacrificial offering to the deity
that is Jerry Miliken.”

While he admits that is quite the
honor, he isn’t letting it get to his
head.

“Jerry Miliken loves to teach
almost as much as he loves to
write,” Miliken said of himself. “It
was only natural that Jerry Miliken
wanted to give back to his most
promising students.” .

As a result, Miliken will be using
his newfound celebrity and wealth
to create the Miliken Award, an
award given annually to a student
deemed the most Miliken-esque by
showing both promise and total
awesomeness.

“Obviously, the winner won't be
the real deal, but he is as close to
Miliken-level as any mere mortal
can, and I can recognize that awe-
someness potential,” Miliken said,

He added that he cannot be
killed by conventional weapons.

Until the award winner is
announced, Miliken just hopes to
focus on his fiction.

“The question for Jerry Miliken
now is, ‘can he get any better?’ For
most people: the answer is no. I
believe that for Jerry Miliken, that
answer is yes,” Miliken said.
