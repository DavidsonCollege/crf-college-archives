Improving Spann Leads Linksters
To Confusing Conference Tourney

By DON PARMAN
Asst. Sports Editor

Davidson's domination of
Southern Conference golf will
be on the line in the forth-
coming Conference tourna-
ment and head coach Tom
Scott is not sure how it’s all
going to turn out.

The Cats will be gunning
for their fourth = straight
championship but Scott said
“it's hard to tell just what's
going to happen. 1-~

“At this point I'd have to
say that the teams to beat
are Furman. The Citadel. and
East Carolina, in that order.

We should be rated about
fourth,”

Scott is counting on the
“steady improvement” from
the team as a result of the
tough matches against At-
lantic Coast Conference com-
petition. Scott hopes this im-
provement will put the link-
sters at their peak for the
conference tournament.

“They'll have to be at their
best if they want to win the
tournament,” he said.

Davidson's lineup is fairly
well set with Mike Spann,
an honorable mention Ali-
American, Doug Clark. Cary

Footballers Lose
Seouts Watch Practices

By RUSS MERRITT
, Sports Editor

For want of a good knee, @
player was lost.

This was the cdse for the
Davidson football team this
past week as it was an-
nounced that Jim Hovis, a
junoir fullback from Rich-
mond, Va., would apparently
be lost to the. Wildcats for
the rest of his college career.

“It hurts us to lose a boy
with Jim's potential,”’ head
coach Homer Smith said.
“He could have been a real
boost to the team this year,

and I'm very sorry to have to
lose him. He's been a great
help to us."’

Hovis actually injured his
knee by a fluke accident in
one of the last practices of
the year last season. Since
then, he has been trying to
regain the strength in his
knee by exercise and an oper-
ation, but to no avail.

“He gave it his all to be
able to get well to play this
year,”’ Smith said. “I'm sor-
ry that he won't be able to.”

Hovis’ knee, however, was
the only dark spot to mar the

athletic careers as profes-
sionals.

Rocky Crosswhite, the 6-9
center who captained the re-

nowned Skin team, appears.

to be the most certain about
his plans. He has been talk-
ing with a basketball team in
Australia, and he seems
anxious to play there. “If
they offer me the contract
I want,”’ said Crosswhite,
“then I'll sign.”

So it seems that Rocky,
called “Turk”’ by some Da.
vidson fans, will perhaps get
a chance to display his tal-
ents in the land of the kang-
aroo.

Dave Moser, the team cap
tain and playmaker, appears
to be interested in playing
for an Italian basketball
team. He was not available
for comments due to a re-
cent, accident which caused
him to be hospitalized, but
the has made it known that
he would like to play in Italy.
Moser said that he could
work: for an insurance com-
pany in his hometown of
Fort Wayne, Indiana, if an
offer abroad fails to ma-
terialize.

There has been speculation
that Wayne Huckel. Moser's
backcourt companion, will
sign with the New Orleans
Saints of the National Foot-
ball League. Huckel said that
the only contact he has had

Hite, Danny White. K. D.
Weeks, Ed ‘Terry, and either
Toby Dawson or tennis play-
er Randy Jones leading the
team.

Spann has been playing
“real well” in recent weeks
according to Scott and rales
an excellant chance to re-
gain his individual title. Last
year Spann finished 19th in
the NCAA championships.

Spann turned in a two un-
der par performance against
North Carolina to snare med-
alist honors in the team's last
outing.

The tournament

Hovis;

will be

otherwise fine spring practice
thus far.

‘We're coming along very
well,” Smith commented. ‘'I
feel that this is going to be
easily the best Davidson team
that Ive coached. Spring
practice, the players’ im-
provement, the dedication,
the spirit, and everything
else is as good as I ever
hoped it would be.”

Professional scouts have
heen visiting the Wildcat
practices with regularity, and
it’s no secret why. The pass-
ing. combination of Gordon
Siade and Mike Kelly and the
kicking ability of Ed Terry
have been attracting atten-
tion for some time.

“Mike is definitely pro
material,”’ Smith said of his
star split end. ‘“‘He’s got the
strength, moves, hands, and
everything else that a good
receiver needs. Slade and
Terry are good prospects,
too.”

At least one new twist in
Wildcat foctball will be
shown to fans next season in
the form of a new offensive
formation. To jncrease the
running attack Smith has de-
vised a formation in which
both ends are split wide on
either side of the line and the
backfield kept in tight. This
would improve the inside run-
ning threat as well as the
passing potential, according
to Smith.

Another boost to the inside
running game has been John
Zaharov. Zaharov’ ‘‘could
give us the ground attack
that we're working for.’’
Smith said. “He has so far
shown us the heaviest inside
running that we've had in
four years."

with the Saints has been teic-
phone calls, and that nothing
has been decided yet.

Mike O'Neill, who saw
much action as 2 valuable
reserve and started while
Jerry Kroll and Doug Cook
were ailing. was not avail-
able for comment on_ his
plans. He stated that he is

definitely interested in a
teaching and coaching po-
sition at Statesville High

School in Statesville, N.C.

Tony Orsbon, a member of
the Skin team. wants to
hitch hike across the United
States this summer. Next
year he plans to attend
Vanderbilt University Law
School.

held in Pinehurst, North
Carolina, on the Pinehurst
number two course May 5-7.

Monday will be a practice
round followed by 36 holes
of competition on Tuesday
and Wednesday.

Some confusion was settled
with a mail vote of the con-
ference coaches over the is-
sue of whether to count four
or five scores for each team.

The problem stemmed
from a proposal offered by
Scott to allow each team to
enter seven instead of the
traditional six man squads.
After this motion was ap-
proved by the coaches, the
debate over the number of
these scores to be recorded
began.

In the past the, best four of
six scores had been used to
determine the team total for
the championship. Scott said
that he voted for the proposal
to use five scores because
“it doesn't make much
sense to use seven players if
you are only going to count
four scores. That's only about.
half of the boys playing for
points.”

According ‘to official word
teceived by Scott this week
the proposal for five scores
passed by a 7-1 vote.

Among the familiar faces
at the tournament will be
that of volatile Lewis Mills
of Richmond. Mills is in his
seventh season as golf coach
at Richmond.

frankly. ‘We won't have any
of our players seeded among
the top entries. As a matter
of fact. we probably won't

son at ail,

“None. of our boys really
have much chance of getting

ent."" Fogleman continued.
‘‘Maybe Randy Jones in the
third division or Woody Faulk
in the first division will have
a chance ff they draw an easy
first match."

Despite their coach's lack
of confidence, the Davidson
netters will score in the
tourney, for VMI will be in
the midst of their exam
schedule and will be unable
to compete. Their absence
will severely complicate thé
draw, assuring each team of
one first round bye, and giv-
ing one_team two byes. Since
an advancement into the sec-
ond round scores one point,
every team is assured of not
being shut out.

Fogleman, using the record
of each conference school
against conference foes this
year, predicted that Furman
would dethrone Davidson.

‘Based on their win over
The Citadel earlier in the
year,.Furman would have to
rate as the favorite.’ he said.
‘However, the Paladins won
by only 5-4. so they are not
a runaway pick. George
Washington will be a close
third after Furman and The
Citadel. William and Mary,

Davidson, East Carolina, and.

Richmond will follow in that
order.”

Fogleman picked Howard
Hunt of Furman as the pro-
bable favorite to take the
honors in the top division.

Charleston. S. C., will host
the conference tournament
on May 8-10. The winning
team will qualify to com-
pete for national honors in
the NCAA tourney to be heid
later in the month.

In IMAC Play

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

beaten by the Sigma Nus,
5-4, as the Nus scored three
runs in the bottom of the
seventh inning. Dale Vash
scored the winning run.
Coach Clark Nickerson attri-
buted the win to good de-
defense.

Also on Tuesday, the Betas
upset the Kappa Sigs, 9-5,

and the Pikas beat the
ATO’s. 12-11, for the Tau's
first. loss. The Betas won

their game with a seven run
outburst ‘in the fifth, inning,
which gave them a 9-3 lead
afte: trailing 3-2. Hunter Rice
was four for four.

The Pikas beat the ATO’s
When Mike Sherrill scored
from second base on a single
by ‘Mark Affeldt in the bot-
tom of the ninth inning. The
Pikas had earlier tied the
game in the bottom of the
sixth with a five run rally
highlighted by Jack Ballen-
ger’s two run triple.

The Sig Eps lost their first
game of the season on Wed-
nesday to the ATO's, 4-2.
John Taylor pitched a four-
hitter for the Taus, and re:

Rugby Team Wins First
As South Carolina Falls

To dream the impossible
dream... .

Davidson's rugby team had
its biggest dream come true
last week-end when the rug-
gers scored their first win of
the season and Davidson’s
first. rugby victory ever,
beating South Carolina 13-10.

1t was beginning to look as
if the newest Wildcat sport
would never make it on the
winning side of the score, as
Davidson had previously fail-
ed to win in eight contests.

There's always a First time
for everything though, as Da.
vidson discovered.

“It was just .a.case of us
wanting it more than them.”
team: captain Zack Mobley
said. ‘We were hungry for
it.”

Davidson, according ‘to
Mobley, used. reverse psy-
chology on the unsuspecting
South Carolina team. The
Wildcats took just 11 players
to the match to face the 15
Gamecock regulars.

“They decided to give us
two of, their substitutes. and
while they were busy knock
ing these guys down during
the game we were able to
move the ball,"° Mobley ex.
plained.

It was only a matter of
time before the ruggers

feels. *‘Considering how hard
we've been trying, I think
that we were due to win
one."' :

Then: Pierce Irby opened
the second half with five
more points on a long try af-
tor recovering a fumble at
midfield. “It was the best
run. that we've had _— this
year,” Mobley. said.

The defense then was call-
ed upon to thwart the inevi-
table comeback, since David-
son has led at the half in its

last four matches only to lose

late in the game. Davidson's
defensive efforts were just
good enough for the ruggers
{o get off with the 13-10 win,
a feeling of satisfaction and
a place in the Davidson
sports record books.
