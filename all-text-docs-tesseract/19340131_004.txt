Eumenean Society Has
Interesting Civic Talk

“The curse. of America is conven-
tionality,” said John D, Allan at the
regular meeting of the Eumenean Lit-
erary Society Tuesday night. In his
talk he deplored the tendency to “ fol-
low the herd” that dominates nearly
every phase of American life, politics,
theology, economics, literature, and
taste.

“The middle class of oy American
people are sadly lacking in the desire
to excel,” observed Allan, and “con-
formity and complacency are almost
in the definition of Americanism.” In
the morals of our “ movie-made” chil-
dren are presented the worst feature
of following the crowd. Reviewing his
case, he stated that it is left-to the
youth of America to stem the tide and
rejuvenate America’s morals, politics
and backbone,

Fields -Horine gave an original read=

which will be announced later.

dent of the Wachovia Bank and Trust
Company of Winston-Salem... He will

activities of the bank.

lor ten years Mr. Neal was connect-
ed with the Charlotte National Bank

as the secretary-treasurer of the Char-
lotte Clearing House Association. He
resigned this position in 1929 to assume
a position with the Wachovia Bank
and Trust Company as manager of its
public relations department.

The Wachovia, in addition to the
main office in Winston-Salem, operates

Williams Donates Cup
To Pi Kappa Phi Frat.

It has been announced that Jack
Williams, Jr., of the Senior class, is
the donor of a silver loving cup to be
awarded to the best all-round fiesh-
man in the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity for
the spring semester just begun. The
merits on which the selection will be
based are: scholarship, participation in
extra-curricula activities, and interest
in the fraternity.

Williams has just resigned as presi-
dent of the chapter for the first sémes-
ter and felt that he wanted to show
some appreciation to the fraternity for
their support during his tenure of of-
fice. It will be called “The Jack Wil-
liams, Jr., Trophy.”

The cup stands 18 inches high on a
metallic base. The inscription reads,
“Awarded to the Best All-round Pi
Kappa Phi Freshman.” Space is left
for engraving the name of the winner
for the spring and fall terms. Because
of its size there will be enough room
for many years to place other names
on the front and back. The trophy
will be kept in the chapter house.

Dr. G. R. Vowles has been asked to
present the cup to the pledge group
tonight and point out the advantages
of winning such a prize.
