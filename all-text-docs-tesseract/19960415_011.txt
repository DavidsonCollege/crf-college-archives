The Lottery

one survivor’s tale
Remember the savagery of the villagers in Shirley
Jackson’s short story? Davidson students re-enact the horror.

The flock of students that gath-
ered at what Residence Life lightly
names “Lottery 101” packed
Chambers Gallery just before Eas-
ter break. Anxious juniors, sopho-
mores, and freshmen embarked on
their annual search for a place to
call home at Davidson.

Students braved the masses,
awaiting a space in line to be deter-
mined by a randomly assigned lot-
tery number.

As usual, the available rooms
were posted on the wall, or rather,
black X’s loomed over areas
claimed by luckier students. They
eagerly questioned one another,
while awaiting their turn to sign -
for a room.

However, as the line de:
creased, so did the number of
rooms. The black X epidemic left
roommates whispering about their
second choices and clusters ner-
vously discussing third and fourth
options. Expectant participants
began squirming towards the front
of the line (as if this would better

their fated lottery number), while
others carefully hid theirroom pref-
erences (just in case someone de-
cided to take “their” room).

The mad dash for next year’s
renovated sophomore dorms found
many students scribbling down
specific room numbers. They
quickly discovered what came to
beknownas the “fat daddy rooms,”
the two large L shaped rooms that
will be created from the existing
second floor lounges.

The demand for rooms up the

hill provided an option for stu-
dents who prefer sinks in their
rooms, more square footage, and
the proximity of academic build-
ings. Dukedorm’s spacious abodes
were also a much sought after com-
modity on Lottery night.

The close of the annual Lot-
tery 101 left many students trek-
king across campus to look at their
newly won rooms. Others sulked
outside Chambers and tried to ar-

range for visits from their long ~

departed friends.

“Sexpert 99

By Jay Hupson

Last week, international
“sexpert” Jay Friedman spoke ina
program entitled “Sex Matters: In-
sights and Outbursts on Love, Sex,
and Dating.” Instead of just lectur-

ing to us about sex for an hour,

Friedman presented the topic in
humorous fashion, replete with
Seinfeld clips, slides, and a body
condom. He discussed topics rang-
ing from dream dates to pornogra-
phy, and a host of other topics in-
between.

One of the first topics that
Friedman spoke about was ro-
mance and how to keepromancein
a loving relationship. One of the

methods that he espoused was an *

idea termed a “perpetual bouquet.”

For a perpetual bouquet to
come to fruition, one member of a
relationship needs to give their
partner a different flower each day,
resulting in an ever-changing and
indefinitely long lasting bouquet.

In continuation, Friedman
tested the male members of the
audience to see if they could name
12 different types of flowers and
‘ maintained that any ’90s guy
should be able to do so. The male
population in the audience proved
their worth by rapidly spouting off
twelve, although one of them was
dandelions.

Another one of Friedman’s
methods to keep romance in a rela-
tionship was to give your partner
Hershey’s Kisses and make it such
that the paper inside of each kiss
was redeemable for a real kiss.

‘Friedman also read several
dream dates from students living
in Iowa. All of the dates that he
read involved spending a day alone
on the beach and watching the sun

spews “good” advice

Before Friedman spoke atendees participated ina "get #7 ©2er
to know you” sex game. Students found people who had
experienced certain things or knew specific definitions.

set. However, one male’s view of
romance included getting picked
up by a helicopter in Iowa and
flying to a deserted Pacific island.

Friedman also gave us his
political views regarding sex and
sex education. Friedman said that
the increasing trend towards con-
servatism in the US will have a
drastic impact upon our country
in the future.

Citing examples of the gov-
ernment cutting sex education pro-
grams, he claimed that the trend
would increase the US’s sexual
backwardness. In comparison he
used examples of European coun-
tries where talk about sex is not
censored by the government and
where the people behave more
intelligently regarding sex.

The last topic of the evening -

was pomography and its role in
society. In general, Friedman sup-
ports pornography; he claims that
for the most part it promotes sexual
awareness. To support this view,
he showed slides from a European
magazine which depicted couples
in loving and not degrading posi-
tions. The slide he stayed on the
longest however was a picture of a
naked man. He did this essentially
to make the male members of the
audience uncomfortable.
Friedman proved to be an ex-
tremely entertaining speaker. Al-
though some of the things he talked
about were overly trite, particu-
larly the methods for keeping ro-
mance in a relationship, he was
engaging and informative.
