Bible Study Classes Studying
Christ’s Ministry

The Woman's Bible Study class met
Thursday as usual. This class is studying
about Christ’s popularity during his Gala-
tion ministry. The class has eight members:
Mrs. Black, chairman; Mrs. A. Currie,
teacher; Mrs, Richards, Mrs. Henderson,
Miss Mary Black, Miss Florence Barnes,
Miss Mary Lafferty and Mrs. W. R. Grey.

Church Addition Is Ready for
Students

The new addition to the Preshtyerian
Church is completed and seats in this section
will probably be assigned to students before
Sunday. This addition improves both the
outside and inside appearance of the church
greatly. The church receives ample light
from the addition’s large windows. The pul-
pit is nearer the center of the church than
before and there is now ample room to seat
the entire student body and the church mem-
bers. r

GLORIA SWANSON PLAYS
IN PARISIAN PRODUCTION

The picture for this week is “Impossible
Mrs. Bellew.” It is a Sam Woods produc-
tion and is on a far more sumptuous scale
than any previous production featuring
Gloria Swanson.

Miss Swanson's role is that of an inno-
cent girl who is caught in the swirl of
Parisian life. Her reputation is somewhat
tarnished, but she is at last saved by a great

“T love.

The lavish settings include the Monte-
marte, the Parisian demi-monde, the carni-
val of flowers at Monte Carlo and the
Riveria. It is said that Miss Swanson went
to Paris just before she started on this pic-
ture especially to buy new gowns for it. Her
leading man is Conrad ‘Nagel, and she is also
supported by Robert Cain.

Those of a somewhat morbid turn of mind
will be interested by one of the most real-,
istic murders ever put on the screen. On the
other hand those who possess a gayer tem-

perament will enjoy the lively Parisian
scenes. This picture bids fair to please
everyone.

probably do most of the actual coaching.

Thirteen games have already been arranged

being made to play P. C. on a neutral floor.

The home schedule is by no means com-

that Vanderbilt, Mercer, Florida and Geor-
gia will be seen on the local floor this sea-

with several Virginia universities and col-
