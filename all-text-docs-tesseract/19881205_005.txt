Monday, December 5, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN

“N

Oxfam proclaimed a success

By GARY WHEELER

A balanced group of students, faculty and
staff cooperated in organizing a successful
campus-wide fast Thursday, November 17.
The event, sponsored by the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee to Relieve Hunger, raised over
$1,100 in individual contributions alone.
Donations from Patterson Court houses are

expected to Significantly raise that total.
Service Coordinator Caroline Craig says
that the fast is one of many Davidson pro-
grams which is aimed at increasing aware-
ness of world hunger. “Last year the Dean
Rusk Program sponsored a series of lec-
tures about world hunger. The annual
CROP. walk, weekly CROP lunches... all
point to a growing concern about hunger
« both locally and globally.” psseuheateate
Funds generated from the fast’ will be
donated to one local and one international
organization. Metrolina Food Bank will
receive one third of the money raised, and
Oxfam America will be given the other two
The Metrolina Food Bank serves 350
non-profit agencies and churches with
feeding programs and covers a nineteen
county area. Executive Director Anne
- Register says the local organization distrib-
utes about 400,000 pounds of food each
month, provides 44,000 meals a day, and

helps some 30,000 persons each month.

term improvements in development. In the
United States Oxfam sponsors education
programs. Davidson’s fast was part of
Oxfam’s nationwide Fast for a World
Harvest that takes place annually the

_ Thursday before Thanksgiving.

Committee member Jay Barron was
delighted with the campus participation,
and especially “the great turn out from the
court people.” Craig estimates that be-
tween two and three hundred people were
present at the fast breaking dinner of soup,
cornbread, and water in the Commons.

Aside from monetary contributions, the
Fast Breakers received help and food from
the Commons, and some students used
their meal cards in the Union:to purchase
canned goods for the cause.

Craig hopes that the fast will do a good
job of “increasing our awareness about
food... how we think about it, how we use
it, and how we waste it.” #9

student body.” When asked about the loss
of contact with the student body from his
time in the Admissions Office to his time as
Vice President, Griffith stated, “all of my
time is spent with an external audience, and
the most important thing is whom we
serve.”

Griffith added that when he received his
promotion, he knew that he would lose :
contact with the students and that within
four years he would not know anyone.
However, he has tried to spend time com-
municating with students and has served as
a freshman advisor in order to maintain an
audience with students.

Griffith will begin his job as President of
Arkansas College on August 1, 1989. He

describes Arkansas College as “a Hora-
tio Alger story of higher education.”

In 1972 Arkansas College celebrated
its Centennial, a college struggling
with no endowment and a dark future:
That same year the college was de-
stroyed by tornadoes. Since then the
college has rebuilt 20 “beautiful build-
ings” and boasts a $40 million endow-
ment. Griffith declared that there are
“few opportunities like it in higher edu-
cation.” In addition, he said that it was
a- special opportunity, one “almost
good enough to leave Davidson for.”

Nancy Griffith has.a position as Di-
rector of the Regional Studies Center at
the college, and their two sons Matt and
Chris are excited because Batesville,
with population 8,000, boasts two
movie theaters.
