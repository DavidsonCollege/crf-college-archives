DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVI IDSON,

FRIDAY, MAY 17,

1962

NUMBER TWENTY-SEVEN

The YMCA will initiate a Great Issues Program and a
tion to expanding other programs in an ambitious program for next year.

Chairman Walter MacDonald
and his Great Issues Committee
have proposed two main topics,
“The Emerging Nations” and
“The Problems of a Changing
South,” to be discussed during
the first and second semesters
respectively. Each of these main
topics has been broken down in-
to smaller sub-divisions, which
will be presented bi-weekls @

The Great Issues Program
termed a “real advance” | by
YMCA President Joe Howell, |
will feature one issue each se-
mester to be discussed among
students and faculty. Utilizing
speakers, printed materials, and
audio-visual aids the program of
seven meetings per semester
will be entirely voluntary in at-| |

tendance

Visiting lecturers on great
issues will be for the most!
part men and women able to
speak upon particular topics)
from practical experience. They |
will be drawn from the ranks of
journalists, businessmen, poli-
ticians, labor leaders, scien

artists, and phi
others

losophers

The lectures and discussions
will be on a bi-weekly basis.
Lectures or movies pertaining
to the subject will be held on
Thursday nights for about an

hour. Following these will be

informal discussions during
the free chapel periods on
Fridays.

The lecture-discussion method

permits the speaker to deal with
the subject informally. and the
delayed discussion permits in-
formal discussions among the
students and encourages stimu-
lating questions

The Great Issues Course has
been a required program for all
seniors at Dartmouth College in
New Hampshire since 1947
Their course, inaugurated by
Dartmouth President John Sloan
Dickey, is based on a series of
lectures given weekly through
the college year by visiting
speakers

The issues discussed may vary
from national problems to in-
ternational relations or may con-
cern questions of cultural,
moral, or religious values

The financial support of the
Great Issues Program will be by
the YMCA and the administra-
tion. In order to alleviate the
costs of various speakers and
films, MacDonald has contacted
33 schools in this area in an ef-
fort to see if they would con-
sider sharing both the benefits
and expenses of the program.

The second major part of the
YMCA’s program for next year,
the series of forums, developed
by the forum committee, headed
by Bill Ferris and Jay Feder-
man, will consist of three main
subjects.

In September the forum
topic will be the students’ at-
titude toward sex; in October,
modern theology; and follow-
ing, a series of forums dealing
with the challenges to the
Christian faith.

The format of these forums
will be a speech, an assembly,
and in. the evenings, a “dia-

In 1918 he was hired as a full-

ty of Pittsburgh, although only
an undergraduate junior. That
was the beginning, and _ after
graduation in 1919, he went on
to a doctorate in physics. And
it was a beginning for physics,
also.

a good feeling to hear someone

reply, “Oh yes, Davidson.”

But while the pedestal may
be a bit too high, Pietenpol
does recognize, and proudly
so, the position of the school.
He attributes its place to the
high academic standards, with
the attendant staaement-hope
that they are still high. “We
can afford to be more selec-
tive; nearly everyone can.”

There have been
changes in 17 years,

The Education Committee
of the Trustees reaffirms that
Dean Johnston acted with its
authority and approval in ac-
cepting Professor Goody-
koontz’ resignation as_ im-
mediately effective.

Professor Goodykoontz, on
his own request, appeared be-
fore the Education Commit-
tee and asked that the effec-
tive date of his resignation
be made at the end of the
school year.

Professor Goodykoontz stat-
ed that he felt that errors of
judgment on both sides had
contributed to the unfortyn-
ate controversy and obscur-
ed the constructive purpose
of his efforts. He further
stated that he regretted the
intemperate tone of some of
his communications and ex-
hibits. While the committee
does not concur in the judg-
ment that both sides were in
error, Dr. Goodykoontz’ at-
titude seemed so changed
and his regret so sincere that
the committee agreed to ac-

period his actions would be
