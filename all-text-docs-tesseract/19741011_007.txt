“The time with this work
has been a time of. total self-
discovery.”* On teaching (she
has taught at Sarah Lawrence
College and at the New School
of Social Research) she again
supplies her own more com-
fortable Mabel: ‘I would prefer .
to call it growing. I conduct
workshops’ rather than
classes.”’ _

She is evidently excited by
this aspect of her work. “‘It is .
only by doing that you learn. I
try to induce a sense of in-
dependence in the actor. The .
artist deals with inner -tools—
more than anyone else.”’ She
notes that these fools.demand.

The college circuit “accepts
standards that I desire.”’ She
serves high compliments: the”
regional and college theatres
are “the saving grace of
American theatre today.’’ _

As talk concludes, I cannot
escape the impression that the
theatre serves Lindfors as the
psychiatrist’s couch as well as.

that I had been obligated to sit

through the long second hour

out of respect for the feminist

movement rather than en-:
, joyment of the program.

» This brings to mind several

other problems. Perhaps less
significant was the lack of any
kind of handbill either listing
the characters, the plan of the
presentation (Journeys:
Present, Past, Future) or the
existence of intermission
periods. .

‘In this case, the failing was
not the fault of Lindfors or her
company, but of the sponsors
of the program here at David-

son. .

This kind of sloppy handling
of a performer particularly in
a situation where the charac-
ter list is essential to any full
appreciation of the play, -
should not be allowed to occur.

Amore significant difficulty
is related to the nature of the
subject matter of the play it-
self. It should be recognized
that not only is Viveca Lind-
fors using ‘‘I Am a Woman” as
a vehicle to display her in-
contestable theatrical talents,
but also as a mode of ex-

— pressing a direct statement of

the goals of the feminist
movement.

The problem is then that
Lindfors is attempting to unite
both drama and doctrine in a
single presentation, and from
the addition of these two
elements to create en-
tertainment. —

However, as has_ been
demonstrated for about ‘4000
years, in literature throughout
the World, the process of —

* wniting drama and doctrine. in
a single entity invariably
culminates in ritual, and ©
ritual is not usually en-
_tertaining. .

Ritual as a unification of
drama and doctrine un-
fortunately has only two direc-
fions to navigate. It can veer
towards pure drama in which
case it usually doesn’t offer
very good doctrine.

Or, on the other hand, it may
move towards pure doctrine -
and become didacticism,
which never makes good
drama. ;

elements which Viveca Lind--
fors and Paul Austin confront
in their-attempt to make ‘“‘I
Am a Woman” entertainment .
_rather than strictly a feminist

In my opinion, it fares better
than might be expected; due

_ both to the vitality of Lindfors,

and the expert techinical han-
