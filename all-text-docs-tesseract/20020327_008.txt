going to
Westminster Fel-

DL: Kate, you run around campus wearing
this cape. If people don’t know your name,
they know you as Cape Girl. What’s the deal?

KF: When I was on the Board organization

Captain Kate: the preaidertt of the”

as a freshman and sophomore, we thought it
would be cool to wear capes while doing
RAKs, random acts of kindness, like giving
out Hershey kisses in the Union. It started off
as a joke spring semester 2000. When we
came back in the fall of 2000, Karen Sweeney,

Boehmler...they
went to Wal-Mart,
bought cheap fabric,
and made the whole
board capes. It was
like magic. So we all
wore our capes dur-
ing orientation and
during RAKs. It
faded out for most,
but I had a special
connection with my
cape. I preserved it
and continue to use it
for random acts of
Kate.

DL: Now that we
got the cape cleared
up, what is this sock
wrestling?

KF: It’s my favor-
ite study break. I’m dominant.

DL: Ok, but what is sock wrestling?

KF: Have you done it?

DL: No.

KF: Ok, it’s this “sport” when everyone
puts on a pair of socks, and you try to take the
socks off the other competitors while keeping
yours on. Great ina single match, better with

Feminism and Davidson

By BETH VAZQUEZ

I’ve begun to ask myself questions about
what it means to be a Davidson student, a
feminist, and a nineteen-year-old woman in
love with a twenty-one-year-old man. I know
it must be possible to be all of these things at
one time and in one place, but too often it
seems like one identity is sacrificed for an-
other.

I learned early on during my time at David-
son that I can be a college student, full of
mistakes and warped priorities, and a femi-
nist.

Freshman year, I attended some political
science lecture in the 900 Room of the former
student union. A freshman boy who sat in
front of me must have overheard my conver-
sation, the content of which I have since
forgotten. He turned around and lifted my
ankle-length skirt to my knees.

“No combat boots?” he asked.

“No.”

“I know you’re a feminazi.” He smiled.

I am not a feminazi; I in no way associate
the feminist movement with racism and mass
genocide. But I am a feminist and it usually
feels right, even when others misunderstand
me.

What does it mean to be a feminist any-
way? I’m sure there are many different ways
that the men and women at Davidson under-
stand feminism, and that’s okay. It has taken
me quite some time to understand that femi-
nism is about supporting women to make
their own choices. It is about respecting men
and women as equal partners in this world. It
is an ideology, a way of thinking and using
language, and a movement that seeks to edu-
cate and raise awareness among everyone.

But no matter how much I believe in femi-
nism and commit myself to learning, discuss-
ing, and raising awareness among my peers,
there are times when my actions cause me to
question.my own identity and beliefs.

I missed my eight-thirty Religion class one
morning this semester to wash, dry, and fold

my boyfriend’s laundry. I felt awkward,
waking towards his Main Street apartment
with two oversized L.L. Bean duffels stuffed
with his clean clothes. I felt like I couldn’t
both do something nice for my boyfriend and
be a “good” feminist.

Ridiculous!

It’s hard, sometimes, to recognize when we

are misguided by our own political convic-

tions. No, I shouldn’t have missed class, but
by choosing to help someone, man or woman,
to complete some task doesn’t mean I’m
abandoning feminism and the ways I try to
live my life in accordance with my under-
standing of what that means. Doing some-
thing. nice for someone I love makes me
happy and. that’s a huge part of what femi-
nism means to me—it’s about men and women
making choices that make them happy, re-
gardless of who our culture says they can and
cannot be, what they can and cannot do.

Having a male partner is also raising ques-
tions about how and why I need to live my
own life first and foremost. I am frequently
allowing this person to heavily influence my
decisions, and my choices have become, in
some sense, limited. A good friend reminded
me that we need to be ourselves as fully and
as best we can, regardless of whether or not
we have a partner. This means we might
make the decision to go abroad for a whole
year, even if our partner stays in Davidson or
studies somewhere else.

Being ourselves as best we can is not al-
ways easy, and it certainly takes practice.
Being in love with someone is also huge and
requires making some tough decisions. Some-
times it seems as though our lives are no more
than containers of event and emotion that are
constantly in disagreement. We need to stop
running around and through the choices we
are making at every second. Slow down. We
need to give ourselves credit for doing all that
we do and for trying to do what we know we
should. We need to respect ourselves. We
need to keep perspective.

This, too, is feminism.

senior last year, lifted me upside down last
year, but he still couldn’t get my sock off,
and I won!

DL: Congrats. So are there any plans for
sock wrestling in the Union?

KF: Most definitely. You’ ve seen March
Madness with the basketball tournament.
We at the Union may create our own May

importantly through fun and laugh-

’ Madness with various methods of release

during exams.

DL: And what are these various methods
of release?

KF: It’s a secret. I can’t tell.

DL: Well, what Union plans can you tell
me about?

KF: We’re still working on a concert in
may... we’re hoping. Eddie from Ohio is
going to put on a show in Duke [Perfor-
mance Hall] during Spring Frolics. We’re
showing The Royal Tenenbaums soon, and I
think Monsters, Inc. too. Of course, there’ Il
be Spring Frolics, and we’re working on a
campus-wide capture-the-flag or hide and
seek type thing. There’ll be some cool

student performers, controversial speakers,
the usual stuff. If you have any ideas, let us
know. We’re open and ready for more.

‘DL: I’m-sure you are, Kate.

KF: See! That’s bad. I don’t even realize
when I’m saying these things. ~

DL: No, apparently you don’t. On a more
serious note, what do you want to do differ-
ently with the Union? And what excites you
about your position?

KF: The course of this past summer proved
for me that Davidson is the community that’s
really there for me. Other communities were
not there to support me as I had hoped and
expected. Davidson stepped up to the chal-
lenge like I never imagined. Through the
Union, and more importantly through fun and
laughter, I want Davidson to be a strong,
lasting community for all it touches. Commu-
nity is my goal. I think a lot of us take the work
too seriously and forget that we’ re just college
kids and that we should be having more fun
and building true relationships. As for what
excites me...Everything concerning big plans
is still up in the air, but what really excites me
is that the Board has a lot of energy. We’re
ready to ROCK the Union. Hope campus is
ready for the ride.

DL: Thanks for your time, Kate.

KF: Thank you. Oh, and make sure every-
one knows I live in Little 104 and my phone
extention is 5389. Don’t be a stranger.

Trust me: she means that. Check out the
Crier, the social calendar, and the Union
Board’s Events Calendar for more informa-

I can’t quite figure it out. Something
bothered me. Something rubbed me the
wrong way. I don’t think that the Davidson
production of Picasso at the Lapin Agile was
entirely successful, but I’m not sure what
was wrong or missing or both.

Steve Martin’s play imagines a meeting
between :
Picasso and
Einstein
played by
Cahit Ece
and Parker
Dixon, re-
spectively)
just shortly
before the
unveiling of
their master-
works. The
two young
geniuses
stumble
across each
other at a
French bar and discuss numerous subjects
with the Lapin Agile’s patrons and owners.
They touch upon ideas of sexuality, love,
genius, and urination.

Martin and the actors handle this mature
material well, giving it just enough comedy
to hold our interest while keeping the subject
firmly intellectual. In this way, Picasso was
more than appropriate for a Davidson audi-
ence.

What I like most about Steve Martin’s text
is its freedom. When the walls of the bar
disappear and the characters find themselves
urrounded by stars, I felt a small sense of
exhilaration. Picasso at the Lapin Agile does
ot confine itself to reality; rather, it sets
itself free with its ideas and humor. Kudos to
Professor Joe Gardner for his set design.

well, but like everyone else on this campus, I
see many of them everyday walking to class,
sitting in the library, smoking a cigarette
outside Chambers. “Knowing” the actors in
these contexts, I appreciated their already fine
performances and effort even more. A visit-
ing actor and Davidson alum, Graham Smith
is obviously an exception to this appreciation,
He was, of course, wonderful as the some-
what chauvinistic Gaston, who we gather to
be a regular
atthe Lapin.

Despite
my appre-
ciation of
their acting,
I call into
question the
casting,
While the
owners of
the bar were
my two fa-+
vorite char-
acters — and
as played by
Thoma
Mills and
Molly Shaw, my two favorite performances —
I did not feel the two actors worked well
together as a couple.

Perhaps Mills was too physically imposing
to play submissive to Shaw. But given the
small audition pool at Davidson, this com-
plaint is merely a quibble. (Also, I commend
Shaw for her line change at the end of the
play.)

Still, I am unable to place my finger on
Picasso’s shortcomings. It is funny, thought-
ful, entertaining, well acted: it has all the
characteristics of a “‘good” play, yet it some-
how comes short.

Perhaps it works better when read, rather
then acted. Either way, it was a fine attempt,
and in my opinion, an improvement over the
department’s last production, Boy Gets Girl;
at least in terms of material.
