of the oratorical than any of the others, and
they presented this type of speech in an ex-
cellent manner. The debate was held in
Shearer Hall and a large number of stu-
dents as well as the town people attended.

OLDEN DAYS

Ideal Girl Picked
at Mercer College

In a recent The Mercer Cluster,
the official student. publication of Mercer
University, the results of a questionnaire as
to an Ideal Girl were given. The answers
varied somewhat with the answers to. the
questionnarise recently sent out by The Da-
vidsonian, The Cluster the question ap-
peared, “What kind of a girl does the aver-
age’ Mercer man want?" The following is
the article describing this girl:

“In answer to. this,
given to a hundred students, sheiks, neckers,
Glee club men, athletes, fraternity men, cam-
pus men, and ministerial students. They
readily discussed the topic, in fact they seem-

subject. He is a law student and says that
there is no hope for him—that he is destined

“As for the lip stick and rouge they seem-
ed to think that it was all right if she doesn’t
use it to excess. She should be temperate in
her efforts to improve on the natural beauty
that she must possess. One freshman said
that she could use paint if she needed it but

that she should not need the war colors.

“Some said that this mythical girl should
not dance, but the majority said she could,

OFFICERS ELECTED
(Continued from page 1)

From a long list of nominees by the stu-
dent council for membership on the council
next year, five men were finally elected after
two ballots had failed to produce the re-
quired number of members. W. T. Coving-
ton, of Raeford, N. C.. and W. A. Chris-
tian, of Mobile, Ala.. were both clected to
the council on the first but it was
necessary for the class to take a second bal-
lot to pick the other three representatives.
On the run-over election Don Stewart, Harl-
Branch, Heber McIlwaine, Ernest Bo-
hannon, and W. S. Woods were candidates.
From this number Don Stewart, Heber Mc-
Iwaine and Ernest Bohannon were chosen.

This completes the entire list of officers to
positions of honor the
seniors tor next year.
