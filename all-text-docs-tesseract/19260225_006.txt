Drop Both Games by Large
Margins

In a very listless game Thursday night the
Oak Ridge Cadets defeated the Davidson
Freshmen by a score of 39 to 23.

Oak Ridge assumed the lead early in the
game and was never seriously threatened.

The play of the Cadets at times was
superb, their passing and shooting was ac-
curate.

The Davidson team showed the effects of
its recent trip. They had lost their pep and
snap because of a strenuous series of games.
At times they played a good, consistent game,
but they could not maintain the rapid pace
set by Oak Ridge.

The outstanding performers were Miller
Miller proved to
all present that he has the potentialities of a
great cage artist. His shooting and floor
game was superb. Scott proved himself a|
terror on the defense; he was all over the
floor.

For Davidson, Captain Crawford and Left-
wich played a strong game.

The line-up was as follows:

STATE-FRESH GAME

Again and forthe last timethe David-
son Wildkittens bowed in defeat. before
their opponents and thus closed the bas-
ketball season forthe class of ’29. State
came intothe Wildkitten’s play house and
marched away with game at a tune of
43-16. From the very start the State
Fresh were on their toes and before the
whistle had finished its echo the score
stood 4-0 in their favor. The State year-
lings showed pep and defensive work
which the Kittens were unable to pene-
trate and whenthe shot was fired for the
first rest the score was standing 18-7,
Goodwin and Young displayed great form
in scoring fortheir team. Godwin was
high point man with 16 points to his
credit and his running mate was ac-,
credited with 12. Holden at guard show-
ed his ability in the basketball art as a
two fold man, guarding and shooting.
The outstanding player for the home
team was Hunt, ringing up tt of his
team’s 16 points.

Held by Trackmen

In answer to Captain Anderson’s call,
some thirty men reported at Richardson
field Monday afternoon at 4:30 for the
first track practice of the season. The
majority of this number were new men,
as quite a few of last year’s squad were
out for basketball or spring football. No
attempt at a regular practice was made,
in consideration ofthe effects of several
months of inactivity on the part of a
large number ofthe candidates, the plan
being to work the men up gradually in
attempt to prevent too much soreness
and stiffness at first. As a beginning, the
entire squad took part in a short calis-
thenic drill lead by Captain Anderson and
ex-Captain Gracey, next, the men trying
out for the field events were sent to the
out-door gym to limber up a bit, while
the track candidates jogged an easy lap
or two. No effort was made to find out
what events the various men intended to
enter as the work for the first few days
is the same for all events. However be-
fore the week is out each candidate will
have his own particular task before him
and will be down to real, earnest work.

Though several good men have been
lost since last year, a large part of last
year’s team is still with us and under the
leadership of Captain Anderson and the
coachingof Gracey, captain of the team
last spring, the future does not look as
black as it might. Gracey will be missed
this year in the hurdles, the shot and
javelin, for in spite of the fact that he is
taking graduate work he is not eligible,
having completed his fourth season on
the Wildcat track squad last spring.

Religious News

At the regular meeting last Sunday of
the C. E..T. C. Pender McBryde acted as |
leader. Three members ofthe quartet of |
Columbia Seminary, who were at David- |
son assisting Dr. Ogden in his series of
Life Work Services, took charge and |
made the meeting interesting and bene-
ficial. Mr. Marshall Dendy showed the
class howto apply the Progressive Pro- |
gram to Christian Endeavor. The other |
two made short, impressive, and stirring
talks, and then the three sang one of
their favorite songs.

The president announced that arrange-
ments had been made forthe class to con-!
duct a program for one ofthe Christian
Endeavor societies in Charlotte and that
if nothing happened the event takes
place on the third Sunday in March. The
class is studying “Expert Endeavor” at
its regular meetings and next Sunday
they will discuss the Lookout Commit-
tee.

Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band met Saturday af-
ternoon with a large number present.
Marshall Dendy, a member of the Colum-
bia Theological Seminary quartet, made
a very interesting talk on “Being a Good

He told of the experiences of the sol-
diers of the late war and the many hard-
ships they were forced to go through.
He explained that their former prepara-
tion or training back in the camps meant
much to them.

All this was compared to our work for
Christ. First comes the training camps
where you receive your training for life’s
work and later the battle field or hard-

‘ships you are forced to go through in

putting the things you have learned in-
If the love of Jesus is pos-
sessed, the life of a good soldier of Christ
will not be hard. The meeting was con-
cluded with a selection given by the
quartet and a prayer by Dr. Ogden.

SEWANEE TAKES

The manager ofthe varsity debates for
|the coming season has announced that

| The University of the South, Sewanee, |
Tenn., has selected the affirmative side
of the query which was submitted by
|Davidson some time ago. The David-.|
son team oftwo men goes to meet the
| Episcopalians-on the 3oth of April on
|the subject, Resolved: “That the mili- |
| tary forces ofthe United States be com-|
bined into a department of National De-|
fense with branches for the army, navy }
and air forces.” Davidson’s preliminaries ,
will be held March oth. |

covered a still in a chicken house. Plans
to conceal the thing had ‘evidently been
well-laid.

Varsity Quintet Defeats
Furman but Drops Game

to Fast Wofford Team

Cagers Take Exciting Match From
Hurricane by Narrow Margin

Last Tuesday, on the second day of
their South Carolina trip, the Davidson
varsity overcame the powerful Furman
quintet in Greenville by the close score
of 33-30. This game came as an exciting
climax to a previous game between the
two schools at Davidson, which Fur-
man won, 40-33.

In the third game of the trip the Wild;
cats lost to Wofford by a narrow margin
of one point.

After a fast and furious first half
which developed everything in basket-
ball both teams had to offer, the David-
son Wildcats fell behind in the second
half and though the Presbyterians rallied
and held the Terriers well the contest
ended 30 to 29 in favor of the Old Gold
and Black. <A_ field goal as the final
whistle sounded gave Davidson her last
two points.

The retirement of Captain Laird of the
Garnet and Black Quint after about six
minutes ofthe second chapter had been
recled off, seemed to be a signal for both
teams to let down. Wofford missed crip
shots right and left while Davidson’s en-
durance seemed gone.

Captain Habel and Shuler for Wof-
ord played excellent games for the Ter-

riers while the floor work of Laird and |

the accurate shooting of Huie stood out
for the Wildcats.

GLORIOUS FESTIVITY

(Continued from page 1)
intermixed with a good deal of humor. One
of his pokes on Coach Mattox won the great-
est applause of the evening.

Prof. W. L. Porter, who is the class reg-
istrar, was unable to attend. The toastmaster
read an original short poem which he had
sent with his regrets.

As the closing talk, Prof. K. J. Foreman.

gave a humorous talk on education in gen-
eral, which proved to be a round of jokes.
He kept the class in an uproar of laughter

| with his witty sayings.

The quartet composed of R. S. Lowrance,
John Foster, Lynn McLain and R. M.
Thompson rendered a number of selections.
Miss Kohn, of Charlotte, accompanied by
Mrs. Heath Nisbet, sang three solos
which added greatly to the occasion.

Following the banquet the class, accom-
panied by the guests of honor, adjourned to
the Imperial Theater to see Rudolph Valin-
tino in “The Eagle.”
