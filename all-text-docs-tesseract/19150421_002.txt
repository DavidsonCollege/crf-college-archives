REGINNING OF THE END.

At no time during the college year is
there such a temptation to forget work
and spend our time doing exacdy noth-
ing, as during the mooth jist before
Commencement. Everyone is worn out;
there is a mass of work on hand which
bewilders even the most energetic, and
vacation is almost at hand. And as if
this were not enough, we have the
finest season of the year to be out-of-
doors an a campus which is unexcelled
its an ideal loafing place.

Bat it is just at this time when we
should starr te work with new. energy
and do something really worth while be-
fore the year closes. Many a game has
been won—and lost—in the last few
minutes of play. [tis noe at all impos-
sible that two or three weeks of hard
work just now will hold a man above
that dangerous dividing. line, or even
raise his standing, to that delightful po:
sition when a “ticket” may be considered

as “‘passed.”'

As important as it is, however, to fin:
ish our college subjects ina creditable
manner, vet there are other things w hich
should take a good share of our remain
ing time. Tt would be a strange thing
if the men of the Senior class have been
in college four vears and have not found
things in the student body activities which
should be changed. Tentative plans have
orobably even been formed; schemes for
improvement have possibly failed to find
expression, simply because there has been
vo urgent reason for advancing them.
But soon ie will be too late, for the
active influence of an alumnus in the
student bedy is nil. Every man in the
Senior class owes it to himself and to
the student body, to review his four
vears of college life and to put into oper-
ation those things which will be of bene-
fit toeDavidson.

The men of the other classes, with
less experience, but with a greater op-
portunity, should make plans for next
vear, The first weeks of every college
session are weeks of confusion, and onl
those improvements will be made which
are planned this year. Go over those
things which concern every man on the
campus—the Societies. Athletic Associa-
tions, Student Body Government, Y. M.
C. A., Clubs, Publications, and the list
might be lengthened almost indefinitely.
Every man should think about these
things and then put his thoughts in writ-
ing or speech; but by all means, pass
them around. Don’t be afraid everyone
will agree—they won't. And only those
changes will be instituted which will
stand the test of criticism.

The most important thing is, first, to
think about these things carefully, in the
light of past experience and future pos-

sibilities; second, to work out in detail |
those changes which you think should be
made; and then third and last, to give

the necessary work to convince others of!

the wisdom of the plans, so that they will
put them into operation.

‘These last few weeks should be made
a season of constructive work for the
college, and in this. work, every man
should take his full part.

DR. VAN NOPPEN LECTURES.

Dr. 1. C. Van Noppen, the Queen
Wilhemina Jecturer of Columbia Uni-
versity, delivered a lecture here Monday
on Holland and its Lit-
erature before and during the Renais-
sance.

Dr. Van Noppen began with a eulogy
of the Dutch. He said: “Holland re-
ceives less from God and has given more
to mankind than anv other nation.” As
the Dutch because of necessity have ever
heen a practical people, they have been
able to enrich mankind with literature.
paintings and inventiegs. “Phe Dutch
have had religious freedom from the very
beginning. They claimed that the ruler
heald adopt the religion of the majority
of his subjects and should not force the
people to believe his own special religion
as was done in England and Germany.
The Dutch realized the value of liberty
and have alwavs remained 9 nation of
individuals. Holland has had a great in-
fluence on Fnglish and American civili-
gations. The fundamental principles
upon which our Democratic government
is founded were borrowed from — the
Duartch.

Dr. Van Nonven made a moving ap-
peal to the universities of this country
to take Dutch into their curriculums,
saving that it was not widely known,
hut was truly great.

DR. LINGLE LECTURES.

Hast Friday night, in Shearer Hall,
Dr. Lingle, at the request of the local
Civic League, delivered a very interest
ing and instructive lecture on “Germany,
At Peace and War.”

The topics discussed under this sub
ject were: the municipal government
and the high degree of perfection in its
organization, the general life of the peo-
ple, the elements that have produced
such success in Germany, these — being
their industry, thoroughness, specializa-
tion, general education and intelligence.
and good organization.

The orders of German society were
given as follows: The court and no-
bility, the public and military officers,
the. university professors, the successful
business men, and following these the
general populace.

The government of Germany rests in
the hands of the Emperor and his Cabi-;
net and in the upper and lower houses
of Parliament. Another topic discussed
was the contributions of Germany to
literature, science, music, and philosophy.

The causes of the ‘present: war were
given as the immense standing armies
of the nations, their colonial disagrec-
ments, Vienna's attitude toward the Bal-
kans, and the autocratic monarchies.

A very good audience composed of the
town people and students was present
and all were well pleased with the lec-
ture, which was a timely one.
