lies in their seeking self satisfaction.
According to the German and Jap-

sets the democratic idea of the in-

The answer, Dr. McKay went on
to say, is that such a relatedness is
a heritage which is too-timited.-The
true version is a relatedness to God
and his fellowman. God made man
in His own image, and man was
made in love and for love. Christian-

The popular notion that musicians

are freaks and know nothing but
music does not apply to great ar-
tists. An omnivorous reader, even
as adad, Hutcheson had mapped out
a systematic course of serious
study--philosophy, history, art, sci-
ence, and at twenty-two, had ac-
quired such learning that George

Ainslee Hight, the English philoso-
pier and authority on —Nietzcsche

As a pianist, Mr. Hutcheson dis-
closes a singularly gifted and ar-
resting personality. The listener
senses the comprehending mind, the
imagining spirit, the humor, and the
pathos that illumine his playing. He
is eminently the translator of the

On Friday, December 11, there
will be a practice match between
the Freshman rifle team and the
