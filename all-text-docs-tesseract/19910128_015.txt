Grapplers Struggle Against

Appalachian, Citadel

By Matt Johnes

Last Saturday’s tri-meet with
Appalachian State and the Citadel
was a disappointing one for
Davidson wrestlers.

The ‘Cats lost both matches by
the identical score of 45-3. In the
first match, against ASU, the only
bright spot for Davidson was fresh-

man Robie Fierro’s 8-6, decision
over Lonnie Coleman.

At that point, Davidson was
only behind 6-3 inthe overall match
score, but things quickly fell apart.

In the second match, the out-
come had been decided before
Davidson was able to score any

points.

With the Citadel up 27-0 in the
match, Scott Townsend took a 5-2
decision from Matt Coates.

The Citadel swept the rest of
the match to register the victory.
The Wildcats return to action in
Belk Arena February 9 against the
Blue Devilsof Duke, with matches
slated to begin at 3:30 p.m.

Spears highlighted the meet for

blazing time of 1:09.3 eclipsed the
old record of 1:09.5 set in 1981.

great poise in their first ever colle-
giate races.

an impressive time of 15:52 in the

400m.

Co-captain Kathy Beach con-
tinued to rewrite the record books
as well, running a superb 5:21.3
mile for a new indoor record. Last
year’s MVP, Kathy placed 5th
overall at the meet.

Returning from a successful
freshman season, sophomore Jen-
nifer Brown ran‘a fine 800m of
2:36.4.

Freshman Amy Bertram led
the way for the Wildcats in the
3000m run, running an.11:57.4,

Sophomore Ben Wiley ran a
fast 1000m, covering the distance
in 2:42.7. Ben hopes to carry this
solid performance into the outdoor
season.

Freshman Wendell Robbins

and added a promising 200m ef-
fortaswell.

among the ten fastest ever run by
Davidson women. Freshman Lisa
Sitek finished only seconds behind
in 12:07.1, and joined the list of the
top ten 3000m

performers.

Coaches Gary Andrew and
Beth Manson haveevery reason to
be excited about the women’s first
outing, and look forward to further
improvement. The return of sev-
eral women from early illness and
injury will only add to their suc-
cess.

ourishes In End

Wharton (5:02) also began their
indoor season with strong perform-
ances.

Themenended the meet witha
flourish, running the 4th fastest

‘ indoor4x400m relay time ever for

a Davidson squad. The squad of
Spears, Hurtado, Dauler,and Wiley

was led by Spears’ quick lead-off _

leg of 53.3.

A spirit of excitement and
energy surround the men’s team.
The addition of many talented
freshmen to the core of solid re-
turning runners should make this
season one to remember. Records
have begun to fall and should
continue right into the outdoor
season.

The men’s track and field team
continue competition this week-
end with meets in Lynchburg, VA
and at ETSU.
