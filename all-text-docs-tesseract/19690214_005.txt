13 Mojos And A Shoestring

With the advent of red shoestrings in the players’
basketball shoes, a new chapter in superstition and
witchcraft has been written. If you have seen any of
the last four Davidson basketball games, you may have
noticed our flashy crimson shoestrings. This is only
one in a long line of maneuvers to give us the edge
over our opponents.

Lefty, having a job which is based on the whims
and feeling of young men between the ages of 18 and
21, has always resorted to that mystical zone of super-
stition, and you can’t really blame him. Whether he
belives in this or not, he generally acts in a way
which he believes will bring ‘good luck” as opposed
to “bad luck.” With his record as evidence, maybe
the U. S. Government should try his methods. _

Did you know that any player getting a haircut
on the day of the game is bringing “bad luck” to the
team? This is not to descriminate against barbers or
their families but just a truth. It seems that several
years ago, someone with the team had his locks trim-
med the day of the West Virginia-Davidson game 1n
the Southern Conference tournament. The team had
a record of 24-1 at the time and after Davidson lost
that game Lefty wouldn’t speak to the delinquent
individual for two weeks. _

Sometimes we use this superstition to keep our
hair long. Having a full schedule of games, it is hard
to find time for a player to get his hair cut. Of course,
this brings criticism from certain people like a Dur-

ham sportswriter who said that his first impression:

of the Davidson players was “that they all needed
haiteuts.” It is apparent that this writer hasn’t heard
of our secret to success. I mean, look what happened
n?. . .
‘° Sai sddition to the haircut superstition, there is the
matter of the good luck Mojo. For the uninformed,
a Mojo is a black plastic figure of a cat. You are sup-
posed to rub it for good luck. Lefty carries his Mojo
everywhere he goes.

Two years ago when we were not doing as well
as we are now, Lefty gave a Mojo to each member of
the team. We were supposed to rub it and it would
bring us success. He also gave one to Doug Cook who
was having problems with freshman math. I lost my
treasured Mojo a week after it was given to me. May-
be that’s why I haven't played since.

After we won the Michigan game this year, Lefty
was rubbing his Mojo in the locker room. I noticed
that the tail was broken off and I inquired how it
happened. He told me it broke off during our ill-fated

th Duke last year. ;

game here are several other superstition routines we
adhere to when playing for Lefty. We always eat black-
eyed peas on New Year's day and never have anything
to do with the number 13. You'll notice that none of
our games are scheduled to fall on the 13th of a month.
We never stay on the 13th floor in motels or hotels.
It’s amazing that Lefty permits Wayne Huckle to
wear a jersey with the number 13. 1 always figured
he would have given me that number.

These superstitions have influenced the whole
team. We usually think whether our actions will have
any effect on our “juck.” Even the skins, who must
have been born on the wrong day or something, rely
on superstition to help the starters in close games.
We have a regular seating order on the bench which
has been developed over a number of years. For ex-
ample, I sit next to Fox who sits next to Tony and
so on. When the shirts are playing badly or losing, the
skins switch the seating arrangement on the bench
during the timeouts to find a better combination for
bringing luck to our comrades on the court. Unfor-
tunately, we never found the right combination when
we played Iowa two weeks ago.

I prefer not to pass judgement on the effect of our
superstition maneuvers. Maybe the little tricks give
some players confidence, which is what the game is
all about anyway. But if we keep winning there’s

the Armfield Blocking Tro-
phy; Lewis Homer, who re.

Award; and Sam Gwynn.

ference regular season title
for the fifth time in the last
six years.

In tommorrow's -televised
contest, the Wildcats will
have to contend with the
conference's second highest
scorer, Dick Esleeck. Es-
leeck who won all-conference
honors last season and seems
slated to do the same this
year with a 24.7 average, is
also second in the conference
in free throw precentage,
sinking 80 per cent of his
charity tosses.

Besides Esleeck, Davidson
will see two new faces. Joe

Brunson, a junior college
transfer center who is
second in conference _re-

bounding only to Maloy with
a 14.1 average, was sick
during Davidson's win over
the Paladins earlier this
year, and Curly Selvy,
youngest brother of head
coach Frank Selvy, just be-
came eligible at the sermes-
ter break.

Steve. McCammon, along
with Selvy a backcourt
starter. is the second lead-
ing scorer for Furman. hit-
ting 14.1 points a game. The.
other starter is 6-5 forward
Jim Daly who is averaging
just below 10 points a con-
test.

Furman brings a 7-14 re-
cord into the game. How-
ever, the Paladins are pre-
sently tied for fourth in the
conference with a 5-5 mark,
winning the last four games
against conference competi-
tion.

Davidson has won the last
10 games between the two
schools. That gives the Pala
dins a motive for revenge.

The Davidson encounter
begins a four-game home
stand for Furman. giving
Furman that much more in
incentive.

And if history does indeed
repeat itself then Davidson
has got a battle on its hands.

STEELE SWIMS TO WIN IN 200 YARD BUTTERFLY
Sophomore star leads tankmen to two victories.

Tankmen Swamp Kkivals
Behind Newton, Steele

By ALEX GORDON
- Sports Writer

Jim Newton's record.
breaking performance in the
100 yard freestyle high
lighted the Davidson swim-
ming team’s successful road
trip in Georgia this past
weekend.

The Wildcats captured wins
over Emory and West Geor.
gia by scores of 60-44 and
and 55-44 to bring their re-
cord to 4 and 2. including
four straight victories. In
each win the tankmen have
grabbed nine of the twelve
first places.

By swimming the distance
in 51 seconds fiat, Newton
broke by .6 of a second the
record set last year by Jack
Steele. The feat is especially
remarkable since Newton
had never done any competi-
tive swimming until after
Christmas of this school
year,

Jack Steele was Davidson's
only triple winner in the
meet. He swam a leg for the
victorious 400 yard medley
relay team, won the 200 yard
freestyle event, and took the

200 yard butterfly.

The Wildcats had four dou-
ble winners in Bill Woodson,
John Cronin. Mac Davis,
and Jim Winn. Woodson took
both the 1000 and the 500
yard freestyles. Cronin swam
in the 400 yard medley re-
lay and captured a victory
in the 200 yard backstroke.
Davis, after anchoring the
400 yard medley relay, came
on to win the 50 yard free-
style event. In addition to
swimming a leg on the 400
yard medley relay team,

Winn won the 200 yard breast.

stroke.

Against West Georgia,
Coach Tom Stevens was able
to do some experimenting
with his material. The final
score is misleading in that
it does not reveal the ease
with which the Wildcats
won,

Two highlights of the meet
were Woodson's fifth straight
win in the 1,000 yard free-
style and Cronin's fourth
straight triumph in the back-
stroke. Cronin also helped
the 400 yard medley relay
team to victory.

Calvin Murphy 8.

In the other Monday game
the Kappa Sigs whipped. the
KA's, 70-60. The game was
not so close as the score
might seem to indicate. The
outcome was settled for all
practical purposes by half-
time, by which time the,
Sigs had raced to a 40-17
lead.

Bob Niebauer led the Sig
scoring with 23 points. Tom
my Norwood followed with

-13 and Mike Kelly with 10.

Lou Williams scored 24 for
the KA’S.

The Sigs achieved another
victory last Friday with a
tremendous second half ral-
ly to overcome the Sigma
Chis, 7569. Down by 13
points at the half, the Sjgs
came to life behind the scor-
ing of Tommy Norwood and
Mike Kelly to get the win.
Norwood finished with 27
points ‘and Kelly added 20,
13 of which he scored in the
final quarter. Pete Norton
had 29 points for the losers.

forfeit in nine games, and
the Sigs Eps trounced the
Betas, 71 55.

The SPE's were only
ahead by five at the half.

ing of Fletcher Hartsell and

ed 28 and 20 points respec-
tively.

chose the NFL club.

Facing the difficult task
of breaking into the Packer
defense, Todd performed
well at the offensive center
position. However. he was
traded to the New York
Giants during the 1964 sea-
son.

A knee injury: forced him
to undergo surgery, and the
Giants released him. He
finished the season with the
Philadelphia Eagles.

He has had previous
coaching experience at Vir-
ginia as a graduate assist-
ant in 1965, and last year as
an assistant to Bill Elias at
Navy. When Elias was re
leased by the Navy, Todd be
came available for a coach-
ing position. ‘Joe Mark, a
Navy assistant, told me
about the job here, and after
I met and talked with Coach
Smith. I accepted the posi-
tion." he said.

Three main reasons brought
Todd to Davidson. First, the
academic background of the
school influenced him.
Secondly, he was favorably
impressed with Coach Homer
Smith and his staff. Finally.
he wanted to réturn to the
South and settle here with
his wife and two children.

When asked about his
plans for next year's foot-
ball season, Todd said, ‘I
hope to develop an agres
sive offensive line which will
balance our running and ‘pas.
sing attacks. We. have a
fine quarterback, good re-
ceivers and backs, and the
line needs to open holes for
our runners.”
