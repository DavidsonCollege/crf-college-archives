Rose blasts Coliseuim’s color scheme

By BAD BERNARD
and HOGMAN
Staff Writers

Bernie and H-Man feel that it
is our responsibility to make
comment on one of the most
controversial topics to hit the
Charlotte area in years: Lee
Rose and the Charlotte Coli-
seum’s insensitivity to his job.

Y’all know the story by now.
Lovable Lee is hacked off be-
cause the Coliseum didn’t put
up some banners and forgot to
paint the floor a lovely Forty-
niner green.

It seems that through all of
this debate, someone forgot to
consult the opinion of another
Coliseum-based team. With
that in mind, Bernie and Hog-
man set out to solicit John
Kochan’s opinion on the way
the Coliseum has treated the
Wildcats since he took office.

We never found John but
were directed to the closest
thing to a Davidson head
coach— game projectionist Phil
Blue.

Said Phil, ‘““You know, Ber-
nie, we're all pretty upset at the
Coliseum officials, too. I’ve
asked them personally on a
number of occasions to put up
those five banners which say
Fifth Place Southern Confer-
ence Finish 1974-77.

Those are the sort of things
that can really get a crowd
going during a game. And sure,
we asked them to paint the
border around the floor red and

Wrestlers

By JEFF HARRIS
Staff Writer
Charlie Parker's varsity
wrestlers, in losing to Pfeiffer,
continued their pattern of close
losses.

Glen Ballard and Pat Dulaney,
as expected, have continued to
wrestle well for the Cats. As the
season has progressed, Scott
Phillips and Rob King have also
emerged as consistent point
contributors.

Against Pfeiffer, Davidson
started slowly with a forfeit in
the 118 lbs. class and a loss by
Rich Reich in the 126 lbs. class.

Pat McKinsey at 134 lbs.,
lost a decision to the Pfeiffer
captain. McKinsey made some
mistakes one expects of a
varsity wrestler in his first year
of collegiate competition; how-
ever Ballard, the team’s cap-
tain, feels the freshman is the
best pure wrestler on the team.

Ballard in the 141 lbs. class
defeated his opponent by a
score of 10-6, while Dulaney
won the 150 lbs. class by a 12-4
margin.

Wrestling his best’ match of
the season, Anthony Sanfilippo
controlled his opponent to win
the 167 lbs. class by a score of
v-2 and Scott. Phillins woan.the
177 Ibs. class by forfeit.

black but the only thing they
wanted to paint over was our
cheerleaders.”

Maybe life isn’t as bad as you
think it is, Lee.

Bernie and Hogman would
also like to enlighten many of
the confused freshmen as to the
operation of that Winter phen-
omenon known.as self-selection.
The Council on Campus and
Religious Life implemented
a policy change which should
make the whole process a simple
affair.

On February 16th, all fresh-
men will report to Johnston
Gym and line up in single file.
The last forty to report to the
gym will be shot to help
eliminate the problem of over-
crowding on Patterson Court.

The rest will fill out sheets
indicating each individual's
house preference. Will Terry
will then collect the sheets,
grade them, and return them to
each freshman to recopy and
turn in before fall term senior
year.

The freshmen will then be
questioned as to how many
dates they have had since they
got to Davidson. The ones that
have been out the most can
immediately self-select a frat-
ernity.

Those who have done min-
imal dating may select an
eating house. Those who do not
date can eat in their rooms next
year.

This system eliminates a lot
of the complications which were

involved in the Love Auditor-
ium set-up and allows the frat-
ernities to get the kind of people

they want without the problems

of oral encouragements. (A
special BB&H commendation to
the committee for their good
work.)

The IMAC B-ball regular
season is grinding to a close
with most of the games played
in either the B- or Women’s
League this past week. In B
League games of note:

Cam Zurbruegg scored 22 as
lst Watts stunned the Squatty
Bodies, 48-38.

Past the Peak got 11 from
Harry ‘‘Has Anybody Seen My
Car”’ Griffith and edged Twatts

In the 190 lbs. class, Mike
Garfinkle was outweighed by
and lost a tough

match after leading 2
second period.

With this defeat, Davidson
lost any chance of winning the
match. Heavyweight class rep-
resentative, Rob King, won by
forfeit to end the match.

After the match, Ballard
remarked, ‘‘the Pfeiffer team

matched up against us very

well, and they got the breaks
needed to win the match.”

‘All I can say is that the
wrestling team is actually much
better than the record to date
would indicate.”’

‘Hopefully we can prove §

what we have in the remaining
few matches,”’ he concluded.
