SGA, PAC clarif

By CHARLES ERWIN
Asst. Features Editor

The issue of faculty and course
evaluation is complex. There is a
distinction, which should not be
underemphasized, between faculty
evaluation for professional purposes
and course evaluation for student aid.

The Professional Affairs Commit-
tee is concerned with faculty evalua-
tion. They want to insure that the
means used by the Academic Vice-
President to determine tenure, pro-
motions, and pay raises are just and
open.

The SGA Committee on Course
Evaluations is interested in helping
students choose their courses. They
want to insure that each student has
hard facts on courses such as number
of cuts allowed, number and tough-
ness of tests, and overall difficulty.

Faculty Evauation
determines tenure,

promotions, salary

Were the faculty to come up with a
new standardized course evaluation
form, President Samuel R. Spencer,

Jr., said he could now see ‘‘no
problem” in giving them a full written

account of exactly how the form
would be used.

The faculty abandoned the last
official college evaluation form, the
Student Instructional Report, in
1975, beéause they had repeatedly
failed to get a full account of how that
form was considered in the evaluation
of such things as pay raises and
tenure.

Professor David Kaylor, chairman
of the faculty’s Professional Affairs
Committee, said that there was
concern that the SIR form might be
given undue weight by the admini-
stration.

Spencer said he believes student
participation through such vehicles as
the late SIR form ‘‘is valuable and
important and should certainly play a
part in teacher evaluation, but I don’t
think it should be the controlling
factor.”’ .

At the time the SIR form was
discontinued the faculty said they
wanted to develop a new form, accor-
ding to Spencer. ‘‘The faculty rightly
prefers to develop a form of its own,”’
he said.

Of the form presently being used by
the SGA, Spencer stated, ‘‘Some
systematic form is preferable to what

might be considered a less fair and
comprehensive evaluation.

“The SGA form is not as good as a
systematic evaluation, but it has been
a conscientious attempt by students
to have some participation in faculty
evaluation and that I completely
understand. a

“No system is perfect, any system
has to be used with care and caution,”
said Spencer.

The main problem Spencer sees
with the published SGA form is that
it may be exerting undue influence on
students in selecting their courses.

“Students have various needs and
respond to different professors in
different ways. A student who might
really find a course very valuable
might be frightened off by students
with a different outlook,’’ he ex-
plained.

In an attempt to make the SGA
forms more systematic, SGA Presi-
dent Thom Young has tried to
“institutionalize the system’’ so that
students will either have to fill out the
forms or signify they don’t wish to
respond.

But his efforts have met with
difficulty because PAC wants the
results of such forms kept confiden-

y form distinctions

tial.

Speaking on the confidentiality
problem, Spencer said that if the
purpose of such statistical forms is
self-evaluation by faculty members,
then publication is not. necessary.

However, if the purpose is to advise
students, then it. should be published,
he said.

Deciding exactly which of these two
purposes they want to pursue is one of
the SGA’s major problems right now.
Young, in speaking for himself, not as
SGA spokesman, has indicated that
he is primarily interested in faculty
evaluation and sees course evaluation
as a side issue.

The SGA Committee on Course
Evaluation, on the other hand, is
interested mainly in evaluating cour-
ses for student use and sees faculty
evaluation merely as a long-range
goal, according to committee advisor
Dana English.

“Obviously some things need to be
kept confidential,’’ said Young, in
response to the issue of whether or not
the evaluation results should be
published.

“But the faculty and the students
are working for the same ultimate
goals and we should work together
and not polarize,” Young said.

Young stated he would ‘‘love’’ a
plan in which the SGA and PAC work
together to come up with a compro-
mise form in which certain things
could be kept confidential and others

Patterson Court Council
(PCC) Wednesday night post-
poned a vote on four self-selec-
tion reform proposals.

The Council voted on pro-
cedural changes and discussed
and amended one proposal
before adjourning until 7 pm
Sunday.

Four proposals

One proposal, submitted by
Greg Anders, would establish
two systems on Patterson
Court: a self-selection system
for the eating houses and a bid
system for the national frater-
nities. fa ;

During the first several
weeks of winter term, fresh-
men would determine the sys-
tem in which they would like
to participate. Fraternities
would conduct formal rush
and bids would be issued
before the eating clubs’ self-
selection lottery.

Students who opted for the
bid system but failed to get a
bid would then be placed at
the bottom of the self-selection
list.

PCC evaluates selection
considers four proposals

A second proposal, submit-
ted by Bill Holliday and Sid
Barrett, would establish a
lottery system of selection.
Each freshman would indicate
only their first choice and then.
take part in a lottery within
that particular house. If the
person’s number came up, he
or she would be placed on the
final sign-up sheet of that
house. A bad number would
put the person on the waiting
list of that house.

Any remaining available
spaces would be filled by a
second lottery in which any
student would be able to
participate.

Peggy Noel submitted a
third proposal which would
utilize the computer to cross-
match students’ first, second
and third choices in much the
same way as course selection
proceeds now.

Jim Brock proposed a com-
bination bid/self-selection
system within each house on
the Court. Each house would
be obligated to accept a cer-
tain percentage of new mem-
bers through self-selection,
with the remaining spaces
being filled through the bid
system.

Anders’ amended

Several amendments to An-
ders’ original proposal were
passed by the PCC.

Each house must state a
limit én t8€*tramver ur people
that it will take in.

» Secondly, although the bid

system is available only to the
national fraternities, spaces
not filled through the bid
system must be filled through
the self-selection process.

The on-campus fraternities
voiced support of the Anders’
proposal. ‘Right now we have
two systems operating under
the same philosophy,”’ com-
mented SAE President Stew-
art Sanders, earlier. ‘‘This
proposal would establish two

Vandalism in Love marks
latest in property abuse

By MEREDITH DEAN
Staff Writer

“It reminded me of a scene
from A Clockwork Orange—a
work of pure malicious des-
truction.”’

The ‘‘scene”’ was referred to
by Dean of Students Will
Terry was Love Auditorium,
after it had been vandalized,
last Thursday night.

According to Physical Plant
Director Grover C. Meetze,
Jr., the destruction was exten-
sive and costly. Microphones
ruined, furniture thrown out
into the seats, lights dam-
aged, ballet bars bent, and
headsets missing.

Love Auditorium is not the
first victim of the rash of

vandalism which has burst
upon Davidson's campus in

the last two years.

Said Meetze, ‘‘Water fights
have caused immeasurable
damage to dorms and the
grounds around Patterson
Court are almost impossible to
maintain.”

‘“‘We have always been
proud of the fact that our
student body was different,”
continued Meetze, ‘‘but Dav-
idson is quickly reaching bor-
derline of becoming yet ano-
ther school with grafitti on the
walls and constantly run-down
facilities.”

The physical plant can only
keep making repairs and when
the budget runs out we’ll ask
the committee for more,”’ said
Meetze.

“Eventually the students

.will_nav, either in money or in

the loss of benefits such as
keeping. buildings and rooms

available for use at night.”’

Both Meetze and Terry
agreed that the majority of
students are being penalized
for the handiwork of a few.
And as long as this majority °
continues to look the other
way, the destruction will con-
tinue.

“Again,” says Terry, “it’s
up to the students themselves
to deal with the problem.”’

‘‘When students cease to
tolerate this destruction and
decide to turn in and expel
those persons guilty of van-
dalism the problem will be
solved.

“Thursday was a very dis-
appointing incident in that,
recently, Davidson, students
finally seemed to be making a
push toward curtailing such
irresponsible and senseless
acts.”’
