As a rule it is just a few that cause these heated
arguments, yet these arguments cause bystanders to
take a stand for one side or the other and before it is
realized what has happened everybody is in an uproar.
For some unknown reason, the boys that usually are
involved in these misunderstandings are boys who are
most friendly.

Back Cagers

Lovers of sports! How about showing a little loyalty
to the cagers this week and support them 100 per cent
in their final spurt, so that they may secure a place In
the conference tournam: piay three games
this week and if they win ail three, they will probably
be in the tournament.

Because of this outlook, although it is a shade dark,
the members of the team have become inspired and
they are really ready to fight for these victories. No-
thing could be beiter, if the ’Cats win the games with
Furman and South Carolina for about three or four
hundred of us to be present at the crucial game with
North Carolina. A renewal of that old Davidson spirit
on the part of the student body might be exactly what
the boys need to win, so let’s GIVE! ! !

Bob Carter and Frank Niven will be out for first

will ‘be asked to perform on the mound. Tom Yar-
borough will be back at second and Squat Owens will
again be assisted at short-stop by Son Latta, unless !
Latta is shifted to the outfield. After playing semi- ie

pro ball all summer, Hogg should be ready to play some
elegant ball at third base. All of last year’s gardeners |
were lost through graduation. ’ If a couple more twirl-

ers could be found, things would look very prosperous

for the ball team this spring. -
