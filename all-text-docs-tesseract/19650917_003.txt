A DIFFERENT TWIST

Tomorrow the curtain is raised on a new foot-
ball season at Davidson. “So what?” goes the
standard refrain.

So a lot of things. For the first time in the
memory of any student here, football at Davidson
is = and the standard “so what's” are out
of date.

“We've got to stop this wholesale losing. It’s
ridiculous,” an unusua ¥ frank head coach Homer
Smith complained last Tuesday. “It never occurs
to anyone that Davidson might win the Southern
Conference. We ought to at least be good enough

to have this mentioned as a possibility.”

It takes depth, speed, and size to win at foot-
ball. Davidson is so lacking in depth that accord-
ng to Smith, ‘We still haven’t had anything resem-
bling a game-type scrimmage; we can’t chance an
injury.” Besides lacking in depth we're not particu-
larly fast or big. Nobody’s trying to fool themselves
into thinking we're any of these things.

But it also takes surprise, physical shape, de-
termination, and confidence to win football, and
these things we have in abundance.

Surprise? Who knows what to expect from a
“%tweener”’, or “coverman”, or a “container” or an

“anchorman.”

Physical shape? You never know for sure, but
lack of injuries saved Bill Tate and Wake Forest last
year, and physical shape made up for their glaring
lack of depth. ‘We'll be all right,” Coach Smith
remarked on the team’s shape. “‘We won’t get hurt.
I’ve been around football a long time; I’m not being
naive; we just won’t get hurt. You don’t get hurt
when you're in shape. We are.”

Determination and confidence? Talk to any-
one connected with the New Look and this is the
first thing you recognize. No one reflects this better
than Smith. On his defense—‘“It’s got to work; it’s
got to work; it’s just got to,” or on the season—
“We can’t wait to play,” or on his weak points—“I
told the boys that you make up for lack of speed
and size by proper conditioning and execution, we'll
have that.”

Coach Smith exudes confidence and it’s con-
tagious, to his team, his staff, and anyone who talks
to him. I’ve caught it, and it takes considerable
self-restraint to hold down my enthusiasm to a re-
spectable low somewhere around the maniac level.

“How bad ya’ gonna beat PC?” I jokingly asked
Coach Smith last week. He smiled when he replied,
“T hope 3-0.”

I think 27-6.

Making up the offensive back-
field are junior Jake Jacobsen
at quarterback, letterman John-

ed a ‘tweener back in the Dav-
idson offense), sophomore Billy
Taylor at halfback and All-
Southern Conference candidate
Steve Smith at fullback. Jacob-

consists of 34 plays, won Coach
Smith's nod through his fine
showing in the spring intrasquad
game.

Jacobsen's targets on the of-
fensive line will probably be

an outstanding spring game as
a freshman, and junior Bill

Coach Smith calls Perry the
