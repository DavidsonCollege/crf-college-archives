Visiting Mathematician
Resolves Map Problem

By BILL BECKMAN
Staff Writer

Using only four colors, can
you color a_ political map
so that no two adjacent
have the same
color? This problem, a sim-
plified version of one that
has baffled mathematicians
for over a hundred years,
has been solved by Dr.
Joseph Miller Thomas,
former editor of the
Mathematical Journ and
former Director of Graduate
Study in Mathematics at
Duke.

On October 1, Thomas pre-
sented his proposed solution
to a group of Davidson stu-

countries

dents and faculty members
gathered at Jackson Court
for a math coffee. His talk

entitled
of Equations of ~*

was “A System
GF(3)."
Thomas discussed a special
theory of equations, applying
it t0 what he called ‘a

tention than it

Bernard recognized that
Thomas was proposing a
solution to the four color

problem.
This presenation at

Duke. ~

Davidson College marked the
first time that Thomas has

revealed his work on the
problem.Thomas was invited
to speak at Davidson by Dr.

William G. McGavock and
Dr. R. Bruce Jackson, pro-
fessors of mathematics, both
of whom had studied under
Drs .Thomas when working
on their doctorates «*

The preblém itself is one
of the most famous mathe-
matical conjectures. It seems
to have been proposed first
by Moebieus in 1840. The first
solution to the problem was
published by Kempe in 1879,
but in 1890 Heawood showed
that Kempe’s reasoning was
faulty. The fact that more
than ten years. elapsed be-
fore atiyone found an error
in Kempe’s~ work implies
that it may be some time
before Thomas solution is
accepted as valid by
the mathematical communi-
ty. But regardless of the
final outcome, Thomas’ ap-
proach to the problem is it-
self a significant mathemati-
cal contribution.

Thomas’ approach is par-
tially based on a result ob-
tained earlier by the mathe-
matician @, Veblen, ‘who
showed that the solution of
the four color problem was

he studies a system of equa

with the definition of a field
can easily verify that the
three integers -1, 0 and 1
form a field under the usual
operations of additions and

This album is a rarity ‘in
poputar music: it is woman
ly. Perhaps Laura’ Nyro’s
only. Counterpart is Janis
Ian, but two things make her
better than Janis Ian. First,
she looks at bad experiences
after their resolution: Janis
Tan is still bitter, but Laura
Nyro is at peace with herself
and her world, and’ for that
alone she deserves. a~hear-
ing.

The second difference is
the music itself. Janis Ian
is writing from a traditional
folk background. But Laura
Nyro is under the influence
of Motown (don’t be turned
off) and Broadway, of the
Blues, .and poets like
Donovan and John Lennon.
True, she does not do hard
rock, so if you're of the
opinion that nothing but
“Blind Faith’? and Hendrix
are worth listening to, you
might be disappointed.

But I doubt that you can
fail to be moved by the sim-
ple lyricism of an exquisite
song like ‘‘Emmie,"’ about
the strength found in friend-
ship, or the incredibly pow-
erful song in which she dis-
covers her basis for life,
“The .Confession,’’ a mind-

blower about transcendental ~

sexual experinece.

On a campus such as
Davidson, we might not want
to look at the-womanly. point
of view—true, it’s foreign,
but her music and poetry
(with such beautiful lines as:
“See your brains on the floor/
become God/become cripple/
become funky . ’ about

sweet cocaine) have magic
in them, and her voice more

than measures up to her
songs. This album is very,

very heavy, in every aspect:

lyrics, melody, and perform-
ance. Laura Nyro must be a
very special person—mystié,,
sensual, beautiful, fresh; I
can't find the right words.

the donor td form a closed
system in which the heart
may be maintained for up to
27 hours by automatically
perfusing itself and the
lungs.

The major advantage of the
autoperfusion method is that
it maintains the heart with
a minimum of mechanical
equipment. Conventipnal sy-
stems may require an en-
tire heart-lung machine to
maintain a heart whereas
Robisceks method requires
only a simple air pump to
bring oxygen to the lungs.

The hearts may be obtain-
ed from cadavers, and when
prepared may be stored and
plastic bags.

Robiscek, however, did not
forsee many chances for a
great increase in heart
transplant success until ad-
vances are made in the field
of overcoming the body's
automatic rejection systems.

He did predict that im-
proved techniques will
make heart transplants clin-
ically feasible before artifi-
ficial hearts can be made.

STEP Reorganized

By BILL LINEAWEAVER -

The Student Tutorial Edu
cation Program, or STEP.

carried out a major intemal /

making itself a more useful
and coherent organization.

Originally founded to pro-
vide a tutorial service for
Davidson-Cornelius-area_ele-
mentary-school children
who find themselves in aca-
demic trouble, STEP now
wants to extend its activities
to new areas of individual
and community activity
ranging from
Mooresville.

“Last year STEP was run
very loosely by its leaders,”
said James Parks, the pre-
sent chairman of STEP. ‘‘No
one’ knew what
was doing.

“This year, we are going
to be organized enough to use
all of our resources. We are
going to do new things, and
do the old things better.”

The major structural
change in STEP is the esta-
blishment of three vice -
chairmanships, each of which
deals with a specific area
in which STEP will be ac-
tive this year.

The tutorial program will
be headed by Bill Naylor.
Besides those from David-
son and Cornelius, children
from Mooresville will be in-
cluded.

According to Parks, the
emphasis of the program
will be changed’ from. ‘‘the
academic-buddy relationship
to an emphasis or the de-
veloping personality of each
kid involved.”

About 50 Davidson students
are expected to be partici-
pating as tutors.

Newspaper Wins 15th
ACP Alt-American Prize

This week THE DAVIDSONIAN continued its win-
ning: Streak as it picked up its.15th straight All-Ameri-
can rating from the Associated Collegiate Press.

The All-American award is the highest rating
given by the ACP. The judges granted the paper 3600
points out of a possible 4000, well over the 3000 need-

ed for the top rating.

“You certainly dug for the news and hung on
like bulldogs,’’ said the judge, who also made com-
ments in his evaluation booklet on. THE .DAVIDSON-
IAN’s “good reporting” and “forthright, documented
and vigorous (editorial) policy.”

In the evaluation the ACP awarded the paper
marks of distinction in four of five areas: coverage
and content, writing and editing, editorial leadership,

and physical appearance.

_The award was based on the issues published
during the second and third terms of the 1968-69
school year, under the editorships of Robbie Hooker,
Franklin Anderson and Bob Dunham. ~

The evaluation» was complimentary in all areas
except one. In its only major criticism, the ACP award-
ed only 75 per cent of the possible points for photog-

raphy.
