New Bidding

(Continued From Pege 1)

Joe gets in. But if its quota is
already filled, Joe, in effect, is
balled, and the lists of Lambda,
his second choice, are considered
next. If the Lambdas have to
use their 27th choice in order
to complete their 22 quota, Joe
becomes one of their pledges.
However, if. the quota is filled
before considering the 27th
choice, then Joe would become
an Iota pledge.

Thus the rushee’s choice is
the primary one. He goes to the
place he wants if included in
its quota.

Details would have to be
worked out considerably and
there are a number of hitches
in the program. For example,
there would have to be some
limit imposed on depledging,
which could get out of hand.
Also there is the possibility of
a second Rush Week, like
W&L's, in February.

Army Drafts New
Active Duty Policy

The Department of the Army
announced recently a new policy
concerning the ordering to
active duty of Reserve Officer
Training Corps graduates with
majors in certain scientific sub-
jects.

ROTC students concerned who
are not needed to fill branch
quotas will now be ordered to
only six months of active duty
for training unless they prefer
a two-year tour.

However, it was emphasized
that a limited number ‘of science
major graduates would not re-
ceive preferential treatment in
exclusion from selecfion for two
years of active duty.

The policy change applies to
those students commissioned ‘be-
tween 1 May of this year and 30
April 1959. Those affected are
students majoring in chemistry,

geology, gcophysics, mathe-
matics, microbiology, parasitol-
ogy, pharmacology, physics,

physiology and engineering.

The change in policy was
made because the specialists are
critically needed in the civilian:
economy.

COURT OF CRITICS

By BOBBY AUSTIN
Davidsonian TV Critic
During the past week, Davidson saw the debut
of a new program, DECOY. Many of those who saw
this spoke quite highly of it as it approaches the
mystery story from the standpoint of a policewoman
and differs considerably from its predecessors.
It seems as if “Mr. and Mrs. 48” have quite dif-

mr" ferent opinions from that of “Mr.
y ?

Davidson.” On the campus, I am
quite sure that Lawrence Welk
would never hold first place. It is

mB Kee Each week Patti Page’s The
Austin Big Record has been gaining much
popularity. She seems to rival those masters Sullli-
van and Allen as far as her selection of guests and
appeal of the MC. Her guests are always those
celebrities who are in the current limelight.

|YMCA Members G
[To Mary Baldwin
For Discussion

Today eight members of the
Davidson YMCA Cabinet travel-
ed to Mary Baldwin College at
Staunton, Virginia, to meet with
the YWCA Cabinet of Mary
Baldwin.

The group will discuss needs
and problems of the college
campus and whether or not to
remain affiliated with the Na-
tional “Y". This discussion was
suggested by Dr. Spencer, Pres-
ident of Mary Baldwin and
former Dean of Students at
Davidson.

Dave Robinson heads the
group. and Vernon Broyles,
Dick Smith, Bobby Livingston.
Gerald Wilson, John McVay,
Bob McCrae, and Jim Richards
are attending with him.

Last weekend twelve mem-
bers of the “Y" went to At.
lanta for a meeting of the Stu-
dent Council of College YMCA's
in the South. During this meet-
ing Smitty Smith was elected
Vice-President of the Council.

Laurens Walker, Lloyd Chap-
in, Smitty Smith, and Charlie
Roberts led workshops. Four
freshmen, Tommy Colvin, Ervin
Duggan, Bill Martin, and John
Cooley, went with the delega-
tion.

Upperclassmen, Barry Benton,
John Kuykendall, Vernon
Broyles, and Ken Forrester also
attended, along with Dr.
Staples.

The main speaker at the meet-
ing was Rev. Al Kershaw.

HIGH SCHOOL DAY

Dr. Pietenpol also announced
the possibility of a high school
day in the near future for pros-
pective Davidson students. He
felt that this would be a “good
thing. If this will give us the
best students, I would be all
for it. There have been instances
in the past where a high school
student, after one look at the

Jones’ motivation for prefer-

the percentage of fraternity
members from the current fig-
ure of about 85% to 60 or 70%
and thus help the independents

He admitted that in his dis-

rious students, he has found
“very few pushing the thing

sees little possibility of the IFC
taking final action on the matter
