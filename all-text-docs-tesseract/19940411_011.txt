Sculpture:
a new creation at
Davidson

By Josh Larned

Michael Oehler spent his Sat-
urday building himself into a small
closet of the sculpture workshop
using logs, scraps of wood, wire,
and miscellaneous bits of: trash.
His desire in constructing this one-
time creation wasn’t to recreate a
living example of Poe’s Cask of
Amonitilladobut, in hisown words,
“to continually explore: what art
is.”

For Oehler and the eight other
students in Advanced Sculpture
class, such exploration is their.chief
motivation in creating in the three-
dimensional. Because sculpture
classes are new to Davidson this
academic year (thanks largely in
part to the new VAC), these stu-
dents are pioneers in what is cer-
tain to be a long tradition in the arts
at Davidson College.

Indeed Professor Cort
Savage’s description of the stu-
dents sculpting with “basically
about everything” is evident upon
entering the large warehouse-like
room: at the very rear of the arts

center. Directly on the left lies the
work of Roberta Stolpen ‘96—an
organism with limbs of coiled elec-
trical cord and a spine of industrial
pieces of metal.

. Leaning against a wall is a set
of rickety set of stairs with a pho-
tograph at the top. The creation of
Robert Klein ‘96, it is a mature
study of the manipulation of space
to convey an idea.

In the middle of the floor sits
an old trunk that has been
deconstructed and reconstructed
again with only its frame and a
thin, white: insulative material.
Lying on its side and containing a
doll within, this piece by Amy
Burrows ‘96 demonstrates how one
creates a boundary around space in
order to accommodate other forms.
Finally, Scott McRae’s tombstone
with the word “God” chiseled onto
its face, makes a powerful per-
sonal statement on religion’s place
in today’s society.

However, the importance of
the new sculpture department ex-
tends well beyond the classroom.

Sculpture at Davidson varies from the traditional mediums.

It contains the capacity to bring
together the surrounding commu-
nity and arouse within it a greater
appreciation for the arts. This will
be the case as these students. will
present their works to the publicon
April 28, as part of the annual
student arts exhibit.

In addition, the department
will be hosting, in part, a bronze

pour of asculpture made by fourth,
fifth, and sixth grade students from
aCharlotte elementary school. The
pour will be done at the VAC in
connection with the Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Arts and Science
Grant. It will symbolically serve
to establish sculpture as a perma-
nent fixture in Davidson’s visual
arts repertoire.

Kim exhibits senior art project

By Jonathan Brooks
The room is filled with electric colors

and bizarre still-lifes. The observer might
speculate—as one of the paintings sug-
gests—that this is'a place where Gaupi
could meet with Dr, Seuss on the’canvas. It
is a place where the artist explores different
cultural roots and where creativity and bold
expression capture the viewer. In the Smith
Gallery at the Visual Arts Center, the prints,
paintings, and drawings of Davidson senior
David Kim are currently on display and
have been received positively by many stu-
dents.

Kim’s works are instantaneously capti-
vating, due to his use of bright primary
colors. He explained that there are multiple
explanations for his use of bold color. Among
his influences, Kim expressed that Gaugin
and Van Gogh are of particular interest to
his work, since both late-nineteenth century
artists abandoned the use of local color in
‘ their art works. In addition, he wants’ to
“communicate in much the same way that
Piet Mondrian did, using primary color to
express some deeper, universal meaning
beyond external reality.”

Mondrian was a Dutch painter who
essentially worked with primary colors in
his contributions to abstract art. Kim men-
tioned that he has only been painting since
last semester, and commented that much of
his work has been in drawing and prints.
Previously bound to the use of solely black
and white in these mediums, he feels that
painting represents for him a great freedom
‘in the use of color.

one’s self lost in a sensual world of swirling
turquoise and green skies and palm trees of
red and orange. The painting is both bold
and emotional in its use of color. In the
foreground, we see a woman bathing in a

’ pond of bright colors. Her brilliant orange

skin shines, not unlike her colorful sur-
roundings. Subsequently, one is immersed
in a world described by the Beatles in their
song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds." In
this work, as well as inGGaugin meets Seuss,
the artist creates a refined, polished surface
but abandons realistic colors.

In another painting, Self-Portrait as a
Black Man, Kim uses the same bright colors,
as he “conceives what it would be like to be

ablack man.” The tapestry and background |
are filled with vibrant colors and curvilinear

forms reminiscent of Art Nouveau work of
the early twentieth century.

Freshman Dan Parham commented,
“It’s really strange. It is really powerful,
although it is not like he just gave the paint-
ing an interesting name. You can really see
his personality in the portrait of a black
man.” ;

Kim’s lithograph Bootsy is similar in its
subject matter to theSelf-Portrait as a Black
Man, as both works allude to a the disco era
of the seventies. Kim feels that he was
inspired to create both works while listening
to funk music. He later reflected that the
Beastie Boys’ album Paul’s Boutique was
instrumental in his creation of Bootsy.

Taking a
brief
hiatus from
local radio

. After2,400 miles, adozen fill-
ups, and one speeding ticket just
outside Kingston, Tennessee, I re-
turned from Spring Break penni-
less, road-weary, and ‘without a
single pair of clean underwear.
However, despite my relatively pa-
thetic re-appearance at Davidson a
couple of weeks ago night, my
journey was not without merit.

The truck traversed seven
states—the majority of the South-
east—to carry me from marshes
and swamps to beaches and moun-
tains.

The world is out there, ready
to be seen from more than just I-95

or I-10. Surrounded by a pine
forest, we cooked quesadillas by
starlight off of Highway 12 on the
Florida panhandle. We tempted
alligators to a midday snack on the
Suwannee River of the
Okeefenokee Swamp. In the wee
hours of the night, we dodged ho-
micidal vagrants amidst the moun-
tainous wilderness. outside
Tuscaloosa. Without a doubt, we
saw almost every small town, ev-
ery two-lane highway, and every
all-night convenient store in the
Southeast.

But most amazingly, we. did
all this and more (four film rolls’
worth) with nothing to entertain us
on the drive but each other’s com-
pany and an AM/FM radio. No
CD player, no tape player, no
gameboy. Just the radio.

My truck has a lot of great
features—four wheel drive, a V8
engine, headlights, a back seat,
etc.—but it just doesn’t have a
good stereo. Consequently, I be-
came very aware of the radio, es-
pecially country radio, during my
week on the road.

Being near Charlotte, we have
the benefit of powerful, corporate
radio stations whose ranges extend
into the outer layers of the Earth’s
atmosphere. Well, at the same
time we’re cursed with powerful,

| corporate radio stations forced to

play the same “top hundred or so”
songs over and over again. Not
only that, we are forced to endure
the annoying sound effects and
idiotic announcers scientifically
proven to appeal to the bland, un-
cultured masses.

How can we escape the mo-
notony of patheticradio? How can
we hear a ten year old song that
never made it to number one, yet,
nevertheless, always made us
smile? How can we hear plain ol’
good country music? Well, we

could overs get anew tape player
