STUDENTS enjoy a Davidson fall...

Dead tree limbs threaten
woodpeckers’ habitats

By CHARLES ERWIN
Staff Writer

After eleven years in office, Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencer Jr. has
admittedly failed to formulate a
definite and clear-cut policy in regard
to wholesale woodpecker habitat dest-
ruction on campus.

The controversy, which seriously
threatens the reputation of the
college, centers around the continued
cutting of dead limbs by Grounds
Department personnel even though
these limbs are needed by local
woodpeckers as feeding .and nesting
sites.

Irvin Brawley, supervisor of the

Students find diversion

Grounds Department, stated frankly ,
“We-don’t do much to attract birds.”
However, he defended the actions of
his department as being necessary to
the protection of student safety.

‘Dead limbs have fallen off trees
and hit students; that’s why we call
them dangerous deadwood,’’ Brawley
explained.

NC PIRG spokesman John Hedrick
emphatically said that his organiza-
tion ‘“‘is determined to put.a stop to
these abusive practices and will pour
all of its resources into the effort.”’

The rural setting and homey envir-
onment of Davidson provide students
with a fertile agar in which to develop
alternative means of enjoyment.

Students have found hours of
happiness on the playground equip-
ment of the Davidson Elementary
School. Chambers offers a hide-and-
seeker’s paradise, although Love
Auditorium is often advisably put off
limits.

A stealthy tree climbing coalition is
in constant search for challenging
hardwoods.

“E.H. Little 900’ allows these with
high-speed tendencies to experience
break-neck paces through the treach-
erous ‘‘New’Fiction”’ aisles or the
often disabling microfilm hairpins.

Spontaneous debates at historic
campus sites allow the student to
empathize with fun-seekers of old.
Nocturnal ‘‘bathing in the buff’’ tends
to dominate the thoughts and desires
of every true good sport.

Freeze-out, a game with complex
rules and demanding rigor is new to
the campus. In chilling December
weather, bare chested Wildcats ride
at rapid speed with windows down
and air-conditioner on. The first
“wimp-out”’ must buy ice cream cones
and slurpies for the group. One
disparaged participant was heard to
say, ‘‘Put some glass in that pneu-

monia hole.”

The big-city dweller may choose to
join the throngs of our number who
make the quick, one-mile«trip to
underground Cornelius. Nowhere
within a two-mile radius of Davidson
can more livid and stimulating oppor-
tunities be found. Nighly debates of
the merits of Funks G-7 as opposed to
Coker Hybrid Corn are open to all.
Groups pair up in equal teams and at
a given signal accumulate all their
belly-button lint into a pile. Wagering
for winning teams, although extra-le-
gal, is popular covertly. Prizes are
given for bizarre colors and textures,
and of course weighing of the team’s
composite piles of lint determines the
overall winner.

The happy Wildcat who has shed
his or her best for bright lights, fast
cars and seedy bars for more tran-
scendental activities may wish to join
the more sedate pleasures found on

‘the campus. The Students for a

Greener Tomorrow spend Tuesday
mornings from 3 to 6 sowing bermuda
grass seed on Davidson’s new all-pur-
pose, indoor-outdoor Tartan track.
The Natural Knitting Society is
attempting to determine more effec-
tive ways to utilize the pine cone in
their Afghan needlepoint work.
Causing the biggest stir on campus
this fall is the almost violent group of
students demanding that the admin-
istration construct a three-acre oyster

comprehensive environmental impact
statement with the EPA before
proceeding with this willful distinc-
tion.

“This is just aneather example of
man’s refusal to live in harmony with
nature. If we would only be a little
more tolerant of our surroundings, we

_ wouldn't have to deal with such

controversies. Really this whole mat-
ter is just a question of squatter’s
rights,” claimed Hedrick.

If the question of ‘‘which came
first—the college or the woodpec-
kers?”’ becomes crucial to the issue,
Brawley is fully prepared to show that
almost all of the trees on campus were
planted at one time or another by the
college.

Brawley fails to see what all the
fuss is about because ‘‘there are over
400 acres behind the campus we
haven’t touched yet.”

Unfortunately most of these wood-
ed areas behind the school are made
up of pine or pine-hardwood asso-
ciations. The open hardwood forest,
characterized by large deciduous trees
growing far apart with only low
ground cover between them, can only
be found on the campus itself.

For most species of local woodpec-
kers the difference is minimal and for

mere oysters at Slater as obvious
advantages from the program, but
also feel the farm would indirectly but
strongly affect student performance
of the GRE’s. The wide-open market
for pearl sales should quickly yield a
return on the investment, not to
mention the deep satisfaction all

but where are the woodpeckers?

DAVIDSON is.a haven for diversion even if

strong populations of Red-bellied
Woodpeckers and Common Flickers.
Both the Downy and Hairy Woodpec-
kers are fairly common.

Davidson's only migrant woodpéc-
ker, the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, is
somewhat numerous during the win-
ter months.

But for the Red-headed Woodpec-
ker, which according to Elizabeth
Barnhill Clarkson’s Birds of Charlotte
and Mecklenburg County, North
Carolina has decreased in numbers
locally, the difference between an
open deciduous forest and a thick
pine-hardwood forest is crucial. It
requires open woods.

With the rise in property taxes,
landowners have been largely unwill-
ing to allow unprofitable open hard-
woods to take up acreage. As a result
this necessary habitat has shrunk
rapidly and only if the remaining
suitable areas, such as college cam-
puses, allow the birds to make use of
trees can they continue to survive.

Several other factors affect wood-
pecker populations including the
usurpation of nesting cavities by
rapacious starlings the hitting of
these birds by cars.

Since the term began only one

Davidson.

spite of the non-existence or deca-
dence of organized outlets is truly
encouraging that the future as our
land is in good hands.
