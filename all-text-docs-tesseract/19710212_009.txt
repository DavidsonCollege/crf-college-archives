“Falcon and Brian played
pretty much alike,"’ Sorrenti-

shooters and ball handlers."

Sorrentino said that he
was disappointed in Winters’
play.

“Brian didn't play as well
as he could have,"’ he com-
mented, ‘In high school, he
hit 25 points a game.”

Throughout the game it -

seemed to be Adrian with
the passes, the shots, and
the ‘rebounding.

Coach Terry Holland said
that Adrian had intended to
play against West Virginia,
but did not because ‘it Was
not his style of game,"'

The Wildcats were downed
by the Gamecocks 70462, in
what must have been one of
the strangest game in Da-
vidson's history.

Four technical fouls were
called, two on each team,
and the Wildcats were
charged with 28 fouls, while
the "Cocks racked up 20.

Officials Birch, from the
Southern -Conference, and
Cooper, from the Atlantic
Coast. Conference, could not
seem to agree, for several
calls were disputed and one
reversed.

On that instance, John
Roche shot two free throws
in the place of Tom Owens,
and ther shot a technical
foul.

‘Holland protested Roche
shooting the fouls for: Owens
and the points were remov-
ed from the record, and
Owens sank both.

‘‘We are proud of the way
we handled ourselves,'’ Hol
land said,: ‘we ran_ with
them. and played a_ good
game."

Holland said he felt the
turing point of the game

Biddies

tapped in 18.

The South Carolina victory
seemed to be easy for the
‘Kittens as they blew the
Biddies out of the Coliseum,
by a score of 109-76.

All the
chance to play during the
game and almost all got
points on the board.

The ‘Kittens held control
throughout the game, lead-
ing by 14 at the half.

The Biddies made a short
comeback just before the
end of the half.

Sorrentino commented on
the strength of the South
Carolina’ team,. and _ said
that they had a particulary
bad game, and may suffer
from ‘‘believing they are
too good."’

Sorrentino said he had lit-
tle trouble running. against
(Mark Little, but did have
some problems defending
against Ed ‘Peterson, the
scoring leader for South
Carolina with 25 points.

Sorrentino led the team in
assists with 9.

The ‘Kittens had 12 turn-
overs to the Biddies' 20 con-
trol losses.

Scoring for the Wildkittens
were ‘Falconi, 25; Wagner,
23; Gadaire 18; Pecorak, 15;
Sorrentino, 11; Vander Gri-
end, 7; Upchurch, 4; Bow-
man, 2; Horton, 2; Huntley,
2:

was the sucession of fia:
throws hit by Roche and
Owens in the second half.

“We were closing in on
them,” he said, ‘until the
technical foul Roche shot and
the two foul shots by Owens.
put them back in a_= safe
lead."

Adrian led the ‘Cats in
scoring, and placed third in
rebounding with six.

Joe Sutter paced the ‘Cats
in rebounding with 12 snags
from the board. He also put
in 12 points.

The "Cats suffered from
their great amount of foul-
ing,

You've reached the point of decision ‘and
maybe things look a little confusing. Have
you ever stopped to consider a career in

government?

We build Federal

buildings...maintain the

National Archives...provide the Government's
transportation and communications network
..supply its needs...and dispose of what it
doesn’t need. We are the business arm of the

Federal Government.

We're progressive...we're diversified...and we
care. We'te doing our part to combat air
pollution...to help minority businessmen...to

rebuild cities:

We're on the move!

Stop the confusion and go talk to the GSA
recruiter. Ask about the opportunities at the
General Services Administration.
