and alumni applying through David-

seven men to represent the college in
their respective states. As oily three
men from one college can apply in

note that Davidson furnished a
comparatively large number of Rhodes
Scholars in the past, since five of her
sons have been selected to receive this
honor, These men are Ben R. Lacy,
Jr, S. T. McCloy, W. P. Mills, Robert
Davidson, and MacDofvell

ship in 1908, being the first man to be
chosen from Davidson. Finishing Ox-
ford 1910 he entered Union. At
his graduation there he received the
Moses D, Hoge fellowship which is
the highest honor given by that insti-
tution,

is not surprising that he served val-
iantly in the World War. While serv-
ing as chaplain in the 113th Artillery
of the 30th Division he was cited for
bravery in administering first aid un-
der shell fire.

In 1919 he was given the pastorate

Bath Room Vocalists

Urbana, Ill, Dec. 6.—Prof. F. R.
Watson of the University of Illinosis
Physics department, an expert
acoustics, explains why persons so
often are bath room concertists. It’s
because the bath room is such a good
reproducer .of the voice, and the sing-
er hears it more plainly than elsewhere.

College a Failure

Drake Delphic, Dec. '6—American
colleges are failing to accomplish the
goal for which they. aim according
to Clarence Darrow, internationally
famous crirninal lawyer. Darrow was
interviewed by (the editor of) the
Delphic during his visit to Des Moines
recently.
“The thing I like best about colleges
is that they furnish a good time, for
the people attending. We only live
once and why shouldn’t we enjoy life
while we are here?” said the famous
