Sultan of Sarawak Will Prove
Great Aftermath for Turkey
Day Celebration

By H. M. WHITE
The SULTAN OF SARAWAK, the re-

sult of unstinted labor and originality on
the part of the Wildcat Minstrels, gener-
ously abetted by Professor Erwin, when ren-
dered in Shearer Hall Saturday night, De-
cember 2nd, will be unanimously acclaimed
by all present to he the most stupendous
achievement of mirthful extravagance ever
staged within the precincts of Davidson Col-
This unique performance will be as
great shock tothe poor old stage in
Shearer Hall, as the smooth pebble was to
the unsuspecting head of Goliah, who is said
to have murmured as he breathed his last:
“Such a thing never entered my head he-
fore.” It is hoped that the effect upon the
audience will be slightly milder. Some have
even been so radical in their convictions as to
express their willingness to wager that 50
per cent of the audience will survive the per-
formarce, but others of saner judgment state
that it as many as two or three escape ‘vio-
lent death by convulsions resulting from ex-
cessive laughter, and live to tell the tale, fu-

lege.

ture generations will indeed be fortunate.

It may be of interest to some who have not
studied. Geography the most recent
hooks on that subject were published, to
know that Sarawak is a country located in
that romantic tropic archipelago, noted tor
coco-nuts, hula hula trees, and missionary
stews, where the inhabitants find their chief
amusements in setting traps for wild women
to replenish the Sultan’s harem, and dancing
in the moonlight to the rythmical cadence of
the skull tattoo—in other words, Borneo.
This country may not now have a Sultan, and
possibly was not represented in the Peace
Conference, but after the visit of the Waila-
cat Minstrels the Sultan of Sarawak will
take his place as one of the great monarchs
of the world.

This performance will be an affair which,
aside from its appeal to everybody in gen-
eral, because of its genuine humorous and
musical merits, together with its unique
novelties, will be of particular interest to
the student body and any who may be per-
sonally acquainted with members of the
Dramatic Club and orchestra. ‘Those who
have friends in these organizations will see
them at their best, and will be in no wise
disappointed. Both the acting and the music
will be of a high order, and though of purely
local talent would do honor to many far
more famous stages. There will be an
elaborate display of scenery, much of it pre-
pared specially for the occasion,. and cos-
tumes of many colors will not be lacking.

STUDENTS AID IN DAVIDSON
CAMPAIGN IN QUEEN CITY

One Hundred Leading Men
Work for Honor of Alma

Mater
By J, A. LAKE,

Last Friday Davidson College students
were called upon to put across a thing that
they had never before attempted. They did
it. The $100,000 campaign in Charlotte, a
part of the $600,000 campaign to put an even
liner and nobler building in the place of old
Chambers was lagging, and the campaign
committee decided that Davidson spirit would
give the whole movement an impetus. Since
Davidson spirit is embodied in Davidson
students, 100 of them were excused from
classes on November 17th, and were told to
scratch every loose sheckel in Charlotte
into the campaign coffers.

Leaving Davidson at about 7 o'clock, the
100 campaigners arrived in Charlotte about

FAMOUS WOMAN ORATOR WILL
ADDRESS A LOCAL AUDIENCE

Students Will Hear Address on
“New Arabian Nights”

Davidson is soon to have the privilege of
hearing Mrs. Ruth Bryan Owen, who is con-
sidered to he the hest speaker of her sex on
the American platform today. She has been
secured by Doctor Lingle, chairman of the
college platform committee, to speak on the
subject, “Modern Arabian Knights,’ on
Tuesday evening, December 12, in Shearer
Hall. Mrs. Owen is the wife of Major Regi-
nald Owen, of the British army, and daugh-
ter of America’s great Commoner, William
Jennings Bryan. Besides being a woman of
executive ability, having held important po-
sitions in relief work during the war, she has
traveled extensively, spending three years in
London, three years in the West Indies, three
years in Egypt, and then journeying around
the world. She is a pleasing and convincing
speaker, inheriting much of -her distinguished
father’s oratorical gifts, and she has been a
distinct success as a lecturer.
