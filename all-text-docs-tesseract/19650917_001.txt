GRID FEVER GRIPS CAMPUS

Wildcats’ New Look Unfolds Here Tomorrow

By ARCH McCALLUM
Assistant Sports Editor

“New’’ is the word that best
describes Davidson football. The
slate has been wiped clean; an
unhappy past is being forgotten.
A rare breed of enthusiasm and
expectancy pervades the cam-
pus.

When Head Coach Homer
Smith took over in late Decem-
ber of 1964 he cleaned house.
In came Ken Blair from Colo-
rado, Dick Tomey from North-
ern Illinois, and Dave Fagg
from The Citadel to serve as
assistants. No member of the
new varsity coaching staff has
ever gone into battle with the
Wildcats. Only alumnus Fagg
has ever even seen a South-

ern Conference game.

With them the new regime
brought a completely new sys-
tem—a defense with such un-
heard of positions as container,
tackler, and interceptor; an of-
fense so revolutionary that it
doesn't even have a name.

“TWEENER BACK

The offense is characterized
by a ‘‘‘tweener back,"’ who
lines up halfway between the
positions a halfback and a wing-
back would assume, and at a
45 degree angle to the direction
of his teammates. According to
Coach Smith he should be just
as effective there as at a reg-
ular wingback position. There
also will be a spread end, pri-
marily a pass receiver, on the

same side as the ‘tweener back.

The defense features four line-
men (two “‘anchors’’ and two
“containers’), two ‘corner’
men, who are actually part ends
and part. backs, two inside line-
backers or “‘tacklers” two ‘“‘in-
terceptors,"" and one ‘‘cover”
man, responsible for covering
for his teammates’ aggressive
mistakes.

Despite the innovations, the
coaches have, during the last
six months, visited the cam-
puses of such major powers as
Alabama, Notre Dame, Flor-
ida State, Indiana and Wake
Forest. Says Coach Smith,
“We're not copying, but we
don’t want anyone to have’ a
good idea we don't take ad-

vantage of."

STADIUM RENOVATION

Summer saw the refurbishing
of Richardson Field at an ex-
pense of $100,000. This first
major work on the stadium since
1924 provided for new. fiberglass
seats and a sandblasting job
on the stands.

When the ’Cats hit the field
tomorrow they will be sporting
new uniforms. Last year's black
helmets are now silver, as are
the pants. The jerseys are black
with silver numerals outlined
in red. ; .

Perhaps the most important
aspect of the genesis of the
Smith era is the new attitude,
in all quarters. Coach Smith is
determined ‘‘to stop this whole-

sale losing. We must try te win
the conference,” he said. ‘“‘It
doesn’t matter how many games
you win, but how well you do in
your conference.” His determi-
nation is blended with confi-
dence—in his system, in his
staff and in his players.

The coaches’ spirit is shared
by the players. All have condi-
tioned themselves during the
‘summer and every one ran a
faster quarter mile on the first
day of fall practice than at the
Jast spring practice.,

Even the students, long apa-
thetic. and alumni, scarce
around here in recent falls, have
indicated considerable interest.

DEAD LAST?
All is not new, however. Dav-

idson is stiil picked for dead last
in the conference in nearly
every pre-season poll. There is
a dearth of weight, speed and
depth. Coach Smith intends to
counteract these Mabilities with
conditioning and precise execu-
tion. Said he: “You can nullify
a weight or speed advantage
with conditioning and precise
execution, but you can never
replace the latter."

Richardson Field may possi-
bly hold its biggest crowd yet
tomorrow. Appearance will be
new and different. So will the
spirit in the stands. And hope-
fully a new tradition of victory
wil be initiated, to be augment-
ed on each ensuing Saturday
throughout the fall, ©

“Everyone

has cooperated

_ real well in making a success
, out of orientation,"’ Powell said,

as he expressed his pleasure
with the attitudes of the fresh-
men so far.

He felt that the freshmen
were making the transition into
college life very easily and that
the orientation period has been a
complete success...

FULL OF ENERGY

The entire freshman class
seems especially full of energy.
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts, Jr., commented on the
great amount of spirit that its
members seem to have and
their apparent eagerness to get
things done.

Burts was complimentary of
the orientation programming.
He noted three ways in which
he felt the more relaxed at-

deal with rush and its problems
right at first has been a help..

When asked about making a
statistical comparison of this
year's freshman class with pre-
vious ones, H. Edmunds White,
director of admissions. was
quick to emphasize the potential
that is spread throughout the
class. But he reiterated Presi-
dent Martin's, warning to the
class that ‘“‘past accomplish-
ments only mean that they are
prepared to meet the challenge
to come.”

WALL UNITY

The freshman -hall counselors
for the first time have the ad-
ditional job of being freshman
advisors, and their responsibili-
ties have been somewhat in-
creased, They feel that the en-
tire class is learning to work to-
gether more easily than most
have in the past. Eric Nichols
said that ‘‘not having fraternity
rush has provided hall unity in
that now the boys can take
the time to learn to be togeth-
er.”’

“This play, on which the musi-

departure from the usual routine | |
at Davidson,”’ noted Mr. Barber.
“While it is not a musical it
does employ songs which are
woven into the text.

“The musical parts are not
production numbers, but rather
consist of non-accompanied folk
songs much like what one might
sing in the shower.” JIM TERRY

“UPPERCLASSMEN’

IF C Head Explains
New Rush Regulations

IFC President Jim Terry clarified several ques-
tions this week which have been raised concerning
the new rush regulations for this year.

In the extensive list of rules the term “upper-
classmen” applies only to students holding an official
connection with a fraternity, Terry said.

The two regulations in question are those which
prevent fraternity men from any contact with fresh-
men in freshmen dorms or fraternity houses after
7:30 p.m. on weekdays, and which prevent “rushees”
from riding in a fraternity man’s automobile
through December 17, 1965.

The rules were established by the IFC and not
by the college, Terry pointed out, and apply only
to fraternity members.

Therefore, Independents are not bound in any
way by the regulations and may enter the freshmen
dorms at any time. Along the same line, freshmen
may ride in any Independent’s automobile.

Terry said that exceptions to the automobile
rule will be made if specific requests are made to
the IFC at least 48 hours in advance. He plans to
discuss the new regulations with the freshmen class
sometime in the near future at a freshmen chapel

eriod.
P Terry stated that he felt that other parts of the
regulations were clear and expressed his pleasure
with the attitudes of both freshmen and fraternity
members so far.

Don Carroll, another hall coun-
selor, echoed Nichols’ feeling
in stating that he believed the
members of the class were
**more dependent on each other’’
than others of years past. The
ability of the class to get along
and enjoy itself has been evi-
denced throughout the orienta-
tion period. .

The majority of the freshmen
were very complimentary of the
activities that had been planned
for orientation.

Dr. Wiggins, a retired lieuten. |.

ant colonel in the Army Re-
serve, said: ‘While ‘writing
some instructional material for
the United States Army, it be-
came increasingly (but not sur-
prisingly) clear that Viet Nam
is a case which could be de-
scribed accurately from dozens
of historical antecedents.

“I hope in my talk to clarify
the type-situations which Viet
Nam represents, some inform-
ed guesses about the future and
some implications of both type
and case for understanding
man's nature."

After the meeting Dr. Wig-
gins will open the floor for
questions and discussion. The
meeting will be held at 8 p.m.

The Ford Foundation
awarded Davidson a $2.2 million
challenge grant on condition
that the college secures an ad-
ditional $5.5 million before June
30, 1968.

Davidson is one of only five
Southern liberal arts colleges to
receive Ford grants, the others
being Austin College. Stetson
University, Southwestern and
University of the South. Selec-
tion was based on scholastic
reputation, plans for improve-
ment, leadership potential and
alumni support.

TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE

Such an honor involves the
tremendous challenge of rais-
ing $5.5 million in either cash
or property, according to Robert
J. Sallstad, director of public
relations and development.

has

$2.2 MILLION

“All gifts, either current or
capital, will be counted and
appreciated. Of course we'll be
depending on our Davidson fam-
ily of approximately 14,000—our
alumni, faculty, parents, and
friends," Sailstad added.

Walter L. Lingle Jr. and Wil-
liam A. White Jr. will serve
as national co-chairmen for the
three-year drive. Lingle, class
of ‘28, is executive vice-presi-
dent of Proctor and Gamble
Co., Cincinnati, Ohio. White,
class of ‘52, serves as incom-
ing president of the national
Davidson College Alumni Asso-
ciation and vice-president of J.
W. Rouse and Co., Inc., and
Community Research and De-
velopment, Inc., Charlotte.

ORGANIZED TEAM

To assist in this extensive
fund-raising campaign, David-
son will need ‘‘an organized
team of perhaps 2,000 people, in-
cluding trustees, faculty, par-

ents, etc.’’ Sailstead is current-
ly lining up ‘‘team leaders"’ and
planning literature for the cam-
paign.

In President D. Grier Martin's
official announcement on June
18, he indicated that this total
$7.7 million program is the first
step in a 10-year program to add
$25.3 million to the college fi-
nancial resources.

DECADE OF DESTINY

This long-range 1965-75 pro-
gram is chiefly concerned with
“brains and books’’ rather than
“bricks.” The ‘‘Decade of Des-
tiny’’ envisions an increased en-
dowment that will provide
“more income for faculty sal-
aries and the instructional pro-
gram.” In general, it plans “to
make Davidson the equal of any
liberal arts college in the coun-
try.”

The formal goals of the ‘pro-
gram are ‘‘to provide an educa-

tional program second to none,
to double its endowment. . ., to
acquire and hold the ablest,
most imaginative teachers, to
maintain a student level of 1,000
men who show outstanding lead-
ership potential and to upgrade
the present physical facilities.”

Sailstad also mentioned the re,
cent Richardson Field renova-
tion and the increased library
budget—‘‘the largest one ever”
—as two results of the Ford
grant and Davidson's 10-year
program.

IMPROVEMENTS PLANNED

A major part of the new funds
will finance improved faculty
salaries and better library fa-
cilities, Plant improvements
will include a complete reno-
vation of Chambers auditorium
by means of air-conditioning,
new stage and lighting equip-
ment and other changes. When
the remodeling is completed,

Ford Gives Challenge Grant

the hall will be named and dedi-
cated as the J. Spencer Love
Auditorium in. honor of the late
textile executive who served
Davidson as a trustee for 12
years.

Other plant changes to cost
approximately $800,000 will in-
clude classroom modernization,
improved campus lighting, resi-
dence hall renovations, im-
proved facilities for athletics
and physical education, new
housing for non-academic em-
ployees, lake campus develop-
ments and expanded laundry
facilities,

Also scheduled for the seven
years between 1968 and 1975
are new library facilities to
cost in excess of $2,000,000 and
enlarged physical education fa
cilities for the regular intra-
mural and personal physical
fitness progress in which over
94 per cent of Davidson stu-
dents participate.
