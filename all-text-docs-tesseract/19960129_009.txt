THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, JANUARY 29, 1996 9

At a recent faculty meeting a
member asked why the faculty has
not undertaken the kind of discus-
sion of Davidson’s relation to the
church now going on in the Board
of Trustees. The question was quite
right. Faculty views on this subject
need to be aired. Here are mine.

The Trustees are considering
whether the President must be a
Presbyterian and whether church
membership should be required of
all Trustees and members of the
Religion Department. Three per-
spectives have so far dominated
commentary on such issues. Some
take the position that Davidson’s
church-relatedness depends upon
constitutional requirements of re-
ligious exclusivity for chief ad-
ministrators, the faculty and the
Board. Others take the view that
Davidson’s relation to Christian
faith must be expressed only in
education and social service and
does not depend upon any theo-
logical affirmations of the college
or religious convictions in its fac-
ulty and staff. Still others believe
that, if Davidson’s history is tied to
Christian faith, its future can only
be secured by obscuring this iden-
tity and retreating from it. They see
the evolution of many prestigious
colleges and universities as proof
of the inevitable necessity of this
strategy.

I propose another approach
which does not assume that
Davidson’s religious tradition ei-
ther secures or threatens its aca-
demic success, but constitutes a
self-identity which ought to be
expressed theologically as well as
morally. I believe that Davidson
can openly celebrate its church-
relatedness without any reduction
of its academic attainments and
aspirations. Furthermore, I believe
that, if Davidson is to be authenti-
cally related to the Christian faith,
the three approaches described
above must be rejected.

First, we must recognize that
any attempt to secure Davidson’s
religious heritage by a nostalgic
dependence upon regulation will
fail. Since it is difficult to imagine
how achurch-related college could
in any practical sense be governed
by apresident who is not amember
of that church, I wish to set that
question aside. Concerning the
other issues, however, exclusive
constitutional requirements for the
Trustees or Religion Faculty can-
not keep Davidson’s church con-
nection alive. The idea that they
can forms the basis for most resis-
tance to change in this area, but the
development of Davidson’ life in

the 20th century demonstrates the |

futility of such a view. Exclusion
defeats not only good learning, but
the very openness and inclusive-
ness that defines authentic Chris-
tianity.

Second, we must question the
very popular view that Davidson’s
religious identity ought only to be
evident in moral values. This view
is embarrassed by any confessional
identity expressed in college docu-
ments or applied to its trustees,
administration or faculty. The prob-

lem here is two-fold. No honest:

evaluation of the conduct of the
college or its constituency can sup-
port claims of moral superiority.
At any time on any issue the teach-
ings of Jesus may be better ob-
served on a secular campus or one

belonging to another religious tra-
dition than at Davidson. Further-
more, relation to the church and its
faithis, at least for Protestant Chris-
tianity, a matter of belief and affir-
mation. A church-related college
must conform its behavior to its
identity, but it must also make sure
that Christian faith finds articula-
tion, not only in its documents, but
also through the religious convic-
tions of those who study and work
there.

Third, we must reject the no-
tion that Davidson ought to ob-
scure or retreat from its identity to
suit social and academic expecta-
tions. There are, of course, those
who believe we ought openly. to
abandon our-church relationship
— and there is a candor here that
deserves respect. But the strategy
of retreat and obfuscation, found
also at other colleges who still
advertize a “churchrelation,” wants
the name, but not the substance of
the relationship it claims. It wishes
to maintain
“church-relat-

diminish or change the College’s
church-relatedness, but to give it
better expression. It seemed to us
thatreal Christianity does not avoid
exposure to other convictions, but,
especially in its educational work,
must welcome them.

A few years ago, there was a
request from students and faculty
that the Statement of Purpose of
the College be re-written to achieve
amore inclusive stance religiously
and socially. I participated in the
composition of that new Statement,
and was glad when the final draft
made clear that Davidson explores
and welcomes other faiths, not be-
cause it is embarrassed not to, but
because the universal reality of
Jesus Christ requires us to. Shortly
afterward, as Vice Chair of the
Faculty, pro tem., I presented to
the Trustees the Faculty’s endorse-
ment of a student initiative which
called for opening the Board’s
membership to non-christians, and
again, I was willing to do so, be-

popular assertion, but to deny it is
to take the illogical position that,
finally, the College’s relation to
the Christian faith bears no rela-
tion to the faith of its constituency.

The worrisome thing about the
present situation is that the desire

- for inclusiveness on the Board and

in the Religion Department seems
driven more by external pressures
to conform to public and academic
expectation than by an internal de-
sire for the openness that properly
belongs to Christian faith. One
hears the argument that the Board

‘ought to have non-christian mem-

bers in order that all graduates may
be eligible, and in order that we
give no offense to non-christians
in our area. From the Religion De-
partment one hears that the teach-
ing of religion at Davidson is in
respect to conviction and mission
no different from any other disci-
pline and, therefore, that this de-
partment should not be burdened
with any special requirements re-

garding mem-

edness” as a
valuable his-
torical artifact
devoid of reli-
gious convic-
tion. This atti-
tude is disin-
genuous, be-
cause it will
not admit that,
in fact, the col-
lege has no
longer any in-
terest in being
associated
with Christian
faith in higher
education.
There is,

bership. That
argument
seems strange
to me. How
could it possi-
bly be the case
that a depart-
ment of reli-
gion not have
a unique place
in a college
which defines
itself _reli-
giously? On
what other
grounds could
one defend the
requirement
that every stu-
dent study re-

however, an-

other possibility. Davidson can
honestly and openly acknowledge
its Christian heritage and make

- clear that its rejection of exclusiv-

ity and its openness to other per-
spectives is a result of, and not a
retreat from, that heritage. Such an
approach is not new at Davidson.
When I arrived here in 1965 a
group of dedicated churchmen on
the faculty had already persuaded
the Trustees to abandon the re-
quirement that all full professors
take an oath not unlike that used in
the ordination of Presbyterian el-
ders. They did this because they
believed such a requirement was
not consistent with the purpose of
achurch-related college. In the late
sixties some of us worked to elimi-
nate required vespers, because we
believed that in our time required
worship undermines a proper sense

‘of Christian faith. Similarly, in the

middle seventies the Religion De-
partment led the effort to allow
non-christians to become tenured
members of the faculty. While I
cannot speak for all involved, it
was clear to me then that Dan
Rhodes, Sam Maloney, Max Polley
and I undertook that effort, not to

cause I believed that a Board com-
mitted to openness on Christian
principles could recruit distin-
guished non-christians who respect
the purpose of the college and want
to serve it. Lately, I attached my
name to a letter requesting a con-
stitutional change which would
allow non-christians to become
members of the Religion Depart-
ment. My thought was then, as it
has been for over thirty years, that
a College, Board, or Department
committed to the Christian faith

ought to indicate that commitment .

by welcoming other points of view.
I did not in the past, nor do I now,
support such changes for any other
reason.

From the very first it should
have been clear that the openness
indicated in all these changes must
be an acknowledged function of
Davidson’s relation to Christian
faith and not a retreat from it. Fur-
ther, it should have been clear, but
apparently was not, that institu-
tional identity of any sort, and cer-
tainly identity as a church-related
college, requires a credible, if in-
determinate, number of people who
embrace that identity. This is nota

ligion — a re-

quirement so far unchallenged by
this department?

Some answer that a college

associated with “religion” will

_naturally and without theological

compulsion be especially interested
in religion generally, so that the
requirement is appropriate. But un-
less we defend the requirement on
theological grounds, we must do
so according to academic criteria
— and who is prepared to argue
that, on academic merits, the study
of religion deserves precedence
over philosophy or history? If the
college desires the requirement for
theological reasons and the Reli-
gion Department denies those rea-
sons, then it seems to me that the
department undermines its present
curricular position. It is further as-
serted that confessional require-
ments for teachers of religion are
both unnecessary and unwise, be-
cause, as an academic discipline,
religion is better and more objec-
tively taught by instructors not
burdened with specific theological
convictions. This, I think, denies
the existential nature of religion
and overlooks the fact that those
with religious commitments may

be in a better position to explore
with sympathy and understanding,
not only their own tradition, but
the beliefs of others as well. When
this is not the case, the result is
often a pedagogy which can only
denigrate all faith as myth and
imagination. The declining popu-
larity of religious studies around
the country may well be a product
of this sort’of instruction.

_ It seems to me, therefore, that
the Religion Department does have
a unique place in Davidson’s cur-
riculum, which in no way threat-
ens its academic standing, and that
the school has every reason to be
especially interested in the profile
of convictions represented in this
department. In this we cannot be
exceptional, for imagine that there
are Lutheran, Catholic, and Jewish
institutions who, while glad to have
other traditions represented in their
religion departments, nonetheless
see those departments as uniquely
representative of an essential fac-
tor of that school’s identity.

The College cannotretreat into
the past, norcan it resist the need to
become more open all along the
line, but a serious and searching
conversation needs to take place
on this campus to determine on

- what basis such changes will take

place. While the Trustees have dis-
cussed this issue at a retreat, I have
never heard a President or Dean of
Faculty or faculty committee ad-
dress it before the faculty. Perhaps
that conversation has so far been
discouraged because we are afraid
of the result. We have come to the
place, however, where the college
must do what it must for one rea-
son orthe other _ otherwise it can
only appear contemptible as it
claims an identity it fears to ex-
press. Davidson does not have to
be achurch-related college. It may
disengage itself, and would hope-
fully do so more forthrightly than
now seems to be the case. If it
divorces itself from the church,
Davidson’s academic reputation
will no doubt continue to prosper
and it will continue to be of signifi-
cant service to the country. On the
other hand, I know of no evidence
that further progress at Davidson
hinges upon such disestablishment,
or that an acknowledged relation-
ship to Christian faith inhibits good
learning. Free enquiry and expres-
sion is often claimed but seldom
achieved. The dynamics of tenure,
departmental rivalries, various re-
quirements to.be correct in respect
to gender, racial, and intellectual
expectations defeat this ideal on
all campuses. In my opinion, a
church-related college which un-
derstands the Christian faith to be
an inclusive and liberating force in
human life is better able than oth-
ers to resist prejudice and create an
environment for intellectual free-
dom.

I very much hope that such a
self-understanding, which has
motivated changes at Davidson in
the past, will do so in the future. If
it cannot, if the Trustees, the Reli-
gion Department and the faculty in
general cannot acknowledge a
Christian basis for inclusivity, then
I hope we will have the honesty to
admit that other perhaps good and
noble motivations control us, and
that as a college we really have no
meaningful relation to the church
or its faith.
