New Housing Policy Limits Group Clustering

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

The Housing Office, in con-
nection with the Dean of Student’s
Office, has formulated a new pol-
icy which will limit the number of
students from any one social
group allowed to live in a dormit-
ory, according to Director of
Housing Bill Bolding. In a letter
to Bolding dated April 30 Dean of

Students Will Terry wrote, “I be-’

lieve we should’ not allow any
group to dominate a dorm.” The
proposal that Terry outlined
suggests allowing no more than 16
students from the same social
group in Knox, Akers or Irwin
dormitories and no more than 15
or 16 students from the same so-

cial group on one hall in the other
dormitories. Terry suggested this
plan in reference to post lottery
room swapping, but Bolding said
it will be a permanent policy.

The controversy over this pol-
icy has resulted from the fact that
it was not made public until after
room choices had already been
made. According to junior Ross
Sloan who is a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, he and several
other fraternity brothers were de-
nied housing in Knox and Irwin
even though their lottery numbers
were better than some people's
numbers who were placed in those
dorms. They were not denied
housing altogether; they were

placed in rooms on 4th Belk which
was one of their lower choices.

Sloan said when he and his
friends confronted Bolding, Bold-
ing claimed that going strictly by
lottery numbers would have made
Knox overwhelmingly dominated
by SAE’s. According to Sloan,
Bolding said he felt it would be
better to exclude all SAE’s from
Knox rather than make a choice of
which SAE’s to exclude. Sloan
said, “I think that is against the
spirit of the lottery.”

Bolding explained that the
policy was made because there
have been problems with SAE’s in
Knox this year and in prior years
although he would not specify

what those problems were.

Bolding said that it was not
necessary to limit blocking with
any other social group. He also in-
sisted, “No clusters were broken
up.” He said that an announce-
ment of the policy was not made
prior to the lottery because he “did
not realize that there would be an
attempt at such a large block clus-
ter.” .

Sloan said that Bolding and
Terry did work with him and his
friends, and thus far Sloan knows
of four SAE’s as well as himself
who will be allowed to live in
Knox next year. Apparently some
of the people who were given
housing in Knox would prefer not

to live there.

Aside from the issue of group
blocking, Bolding feels the long
waiting list is the only other prob-
lem with this year’s lottery. There
are 70 men and 26 women on the
list. Bolding feels one explanation
for the long waiting list is fewer
upper classmen opting to live off
campus. He said, “We are en-
couraging men who are far down
on the waiting list to seek housing
off campus, but we feel pretty
confident all the women will be
given on-campus housing.” He
said the Housing Office will work
with the students on the waiting
list over the summer until every-
one has housing.

ATCAllocates Funds To Student Organizations

By NELLE McCORKLE

The Activities Tax Council
(ATC) announced $69,050 in al-
locations for student organiza-
tions at Tuesday's Student Gov-
ernment Association meeting.
Calling approval of the ATC pro-
posal “one of the most important
things the SGA does,” ATC
Chairman Anne Miano fielded
questions from senators and publi-
cation heads about specific alloca-
tions.

Following discussion the sen-
ate voted 11-1 (with a negative
vote from junior Jay Gaither and
an abstention from junior David
White) to approve the ATC
budget, contingent upon the Presi-
dent’s office's subsidizing $1,500
for the Martin Luther King Lec-
ture Series.

According to ATC mules, each
student organization desiring in-
clusion in the ATC allocations
must submit an itemized budget
proposal for the 1985-86 school
year. The ATC, comprised of
SGA officers Miano, Christie
Johnson, and Louis Zbinden, and
at- large members Martha Yeide,
Rob Vaughn, and Steve Baskin,
examines each proposal. With the

help of faculty advisors Dean of
Students Will Terry, Director of
the College Union William
Brown, Business Manager Robert
Currie, Comptroller Robert
Davidson, and P.E. Director
Sterling Martin for the Club
Sports section of the budget, the
ATC draws up a recommended
budget, which must be approved
by the SGA. The purpose of the
ATC, Miano said, is “to represent
students’ money,” explaining that
$50 from each student's tuition
goes toward the student organiza-
tions budget.

Quips and Cranks, the top-
budgeted organization, received
$26,000, This amount is $1,575
short of that recommended by
editor Peggy Pierotti.

Miano said eliminating pro-
posed salaries accounted for $900
of the budget cut. “All other posi-
tions of responsibility involve
salaries,” said Pierotti, “and it
seems only fair that Quips and
Cranks jobs should~too.” She
added, “Because the job takes
time, I feel there should be a sal-
ary.”

Because of ATC cuts, Pierotti
said she is seeking a lower pub-

Davidsonian Editor John Ga-

cated for the newspaper, “Cm
pleased with it, and I think the
ATC was very fair.” Gathings
praised Miano and her committee
for “logical” analysis of each or-
ganization’s proposal.

The literary magazine The
Davidson Miscellany was cut
from the budget. Continuing
Editor, German Professor Julius

Winkler, said, “We hope to keep
publishing with other sources of
funding.”

He added that student interest
in the publication has waned in re-
cent years. Therefore. he said The
Miscellany did not submit a
budget proposal for 1985-86, al-
though the magazine received
$3,200 in ATC funds in 1984-85.

Also eliminated from ATC al-
locations, The Unknown Fellow-
ship (TUF) will receive its fund-

Miano said.

SGA President Beadsie Woo
called the $4.800 SGA allotment
“fine,” adding, the ATC “did a
wonderful job. Anne Miano was
fantastic.” The 1985-86 allocation
represents a $700 decrease from

Deans Ross And Griffith Expect New Appomtments

By DAVID VAN PELT and
TED WILSON

The Trustees are expected
today to approve John Griffith as
new vice-president of develop-
ment and Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Sue Ross as the new Regis-
trar, according to Assistant to the
President Rick Love. Vice-Presi-
dent of Development Jack Powers
resigned Apri! 30: and Registrar
Richard Burts will retire at the end
of the school year.

Powers will assume a position
at St. Andrews Presbyterian Col-
lege beginning June |. Burts will
continue to live in Davidson. Ross
and Griffith would not comment

on the new positions or their suc-
cessors until they are made offi-
cial with the Trustees’ approval.

Powers said he decided to
leave because he has attained his
goals in the office. The fundrais-
ing program he organized “is
moving along at a six-million dol-
lar yearly rate,” he said, and the
endowment fund has exceeded its
goal of 35 million dollars. The
fund now contains 49 million dol-
lars.

According to Powers, major
developments during his tenure
include improvements in the com-
munications program and printed
publications. “We made a lot of

renovation with the Davidson Up-
date and started an annual report
comparable to a corporation's an-
nual report.”

He added the Alumni office
has also been improved. “We ree-
ognized the Board of Alumni As-
sociation to make it more of a
working group than it was be-
fore.”

Burts said he made his deci-
sion to retire last fall after twenty-
four years at Davidson, ten as
Dean of Students and fourteen as
Registrar. He said he plans to re-
main active in the Davidson Col-
lege community, though he will
“refrain from any interference” in

Ross” actions as Registrar. Burts
said he is unaware of any changes
planned for the Registrar's office
following his departure.

Burts cited increased com-
puterization as the most important
development during his years as
registrar. Though the registrar's
office used computers before he
took office, he said “now we are
fully computerized."

Another development _ the
computerization has made possi-
ble, Burts said, is a revision of the
registration process to make more
classes available to incoming
freshmen. Burts said he has also
refined the self-scheduled exam

4

procedure that the registrar’s of.
fice controls.

Burts said he has no consum.-
ing hobbies to pursue during his
retirement. “I've lived my work,”
he said. Burts said he eagerly an-
ticipates participating in College
functions that his work made im-
possible.

Love said Kuykendall's
choice of Ross and Griffith for the
vacated position has been ap-
proved by the Faculty Executive
Committee. Love said the Trus-
tees must also approve the nomi-
nation.
