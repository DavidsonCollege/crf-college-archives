Spongetones in the 900 Room

The Fab Four reunited

Unusual trio
to perform
in Hodson

Galatea was an ivory statue
of a maiden carved by Pygma-
lion and given life by Aphrodite
in response to the sculptor’s
prayer. In much the same way,
the Galatea Trio seeks to
“Breathe life’ into the music
they play.

The Galatea Trio offers two
unusual voice and instrumental
combinations: soprano clarinet
and piano, and soprano horn
and piano.

The trio’s combination of
soprano, clarinet and piano will
perform Friday, February 20 at
8:15 in Hodson Hall.

The program will include two
songs by Johann Sebastian
Bach, six German songs by
Ludwig Spohr, Cooke’s Three
Songs of Innocence, Meyer-
beer’s Hirtenlied, two songs for
soprano and clarinet by Gordon
Jacob, Alex Templeton’s Poc-
ket Size Sonata No. 2 for piano
and clarinet, and four songs by
Schubert.

The members of the trio are
soprano Elisabeth Palmedo, a
graduate of the New England
‘Conservatory of Music, pianist
David Shapiro, a graduate of
Columbia University and clar-
inetist Gerard Vabulas, a grad-
uate.of the Manhatten School of
Music. Each is a superb soloist
in his or her own right.

The Galatea Trio’s perfor-
mance will be free.

Pianist Paul Martin

The ’60’s had the privilege of
becoming nostalgic almost be-
fore they were over. This Friday
the 900 Room will offer some
’60’s nostalgia as The Sponge-
tones revive the music of the
decade.

The Spongetones, a popular
Charlotte band, consists of four

_ musicians. Their idols are-the

Beatles, and their specialty is
performing the songs of the Fab
Four. .

However, The Spongetones
are more than a road version of
Beatlemania. Their repertoire
includes niimbers by the Rolling
Stones(. Kinks, Yardbirds,
Cream and the Who. .

The band members are lead
guitarists Jamie Hoover and
Pat Walters, Steve Stoeckel on
bass guitar and drummer Rob
Thorne.

Performances will be at 9:30
and 11:00 p.m. Tickets are $2 at
the door.

Panel discusses hunger

“Everyone talks about world
hunger, but what about the
hunger problem in our own
area?’’ Junior Betsy Thomas
said. ‘It’s just as crucial and
demands just as much atten-
tion.”’

In order to increase aware-
ness among students about
domestic hunger issues, the
Crop Block of the Y Service
Corps is holding a Crop Sympo-
sium this Sunday.

A panel of three speakers will
discuss various aspects of the
domestic hunger problem. Hope
Shoud, arepresentative from
the Frank Porter Graham Cen-
ter, will speak on ‘‘The Plight of
Small Farmers and Small Farm

Advocacy.”

In a more urban focus Dr.
Raymond Wheeler, a board
member of the N.C. Hunger
Association, will speak on
‘‘Health Effects of Malnutri-
tion: The Problem in the Caro-
linas.”’

Finally, Jennifer Henderson

from the N.C. Hunger Coalition
will present the state and
federal government side of the
issue in her talk on ‘‘Current
Food Policy Legislation.”
' The symposium will be in the
900 Room. The panel discussion
will be 7-8 p.m. From 8-9 p.m.
there will be an informal open
discussion with refreshments.

James Baskin and James Funsten try:to deal with their
imminent separation in Love Letters on Blue Paper. See Story
