Coach upholds sports, academics

Dave Pritchett is a man on
the move, and hopefully this
means the Davidson Basket-
ball Program is on the move
toward its goal of national
prominence.

In the three weeks he has
been thé new Davidson coach,
Pritchett has been a hard man
to find because he has spent
very little time at Davidson.

He has been constantly

moving from place to place,
doing what he is best known
for--recruiting.

The energetic Pritchett
paused briefly to talk about
the future and aims of the
basketball program several
nights ago. His outlook on the
Davidson program reveals his
confidence and optimism.

Pritchett was an assistant
coach under former Davidson
head coach Lefty Driesell at
the University of Maryland for
three years prior to accepting
his new position at Davidson.

He was drawn to Davidson
because of its academic sta-
ture and the challenge of
rebuilding what was once a
nationally prominent basket-
ball program. Another factor
that influenced his decision
was that he feels ‘““Davidson
will be a great place to raise
three sons.”

Prtichett said, “If I did not
think I could return Davidson
to its national standing, I

wouldn’t have come,”’ when he:

first accepted the position of
head coach.

There is no doubt that the
man is dedicated to rebuilding
the program, and he cites
three reasons why he thinks
Davidson has the potential of
being a basketball power-
house. “Davidson is the finest
academic school in the country
that can offer full scholar-
ships, fine facilities, and a
proud tradition,” he said.

Through these assets,
Pritchett hopes to draw top
quality players to Davidson.

Due to the large amount of
time spent on recruiting,
Pritchett has not had time to
review Davidson's 1975-76
season. However, he has
viewed some game films and
met with the players several
times, to form some prelimi-
nary of the present players
and their abilities.

Pritchett definitely feels
that there was talent and a
commitment to the program
on this past year’s team.

But he does not plan to
evaluate the players, espe-
cially the younger ones on the
past season’s performances.

Pritchett eaid, ‘I think it is
foolish to have high expecta-
tions of freshmen. I don’t care
how good they are, they are
still freshmen, and they lack
experience.

To strengthen his point, he
used the University of Mary-
land’s starting center, fresh-
man Larry Gibson, as an

example: ‘Larry’ Gibson’ was.

one of the best high school
centegs;’ I had ever seen, but

he reason no assistant

oaches have been named.
"According to Pritchett, the:

NEW HEAD BASKETBALL COACH Dave Pritchett

does what he does best—recruits.

when he started playing in the
ACC he was embarassed.”’

Pritchett hopes the players
don’t get discouraged over the
poor season, and he plans to
start all over again with them
next fall.

Davidson must attract top
quality players if it ever hopes
to return to national promi-
nence, so recruiting may be
the most crucial factor in
determining the source of the
program over the next few

Coach Pritchett has been
labelled a ‘‘master recruiter’’
and his talents have been
sorely tested over the past
weeks. R

He has faced the monumen-
tal task of starting recruiting
late and working alone, yet he
is not frightened by the re-
cruiting situation. He said,
“With the proper organization
and discipline, this year’s

iting’ will be salvaged.”

But he adds he is seeking
blue chip prospects, and he
does not want to sign any
players just to pacify the
anxious people.

Pritchett chose not to reveal
any specific details about who
he was recruiting. He did say,
however, that he was looking

for ‘‘players to help the
inside game and rebounding,
and for guards because you
never should miss a season
without recruiting guards.”
Mainly, he discussed the
recruiting situation he faces at
Davidson in a general way.
Pritchett confidently said,
“Somewhere there are eight or
ten great students who are
outstanding basketball play-
ers and all we have to do is
find them and persuade them
to attend Davidson.”
Pritchett has no intention
of sacrificing ‘‘academic,
ethical, or moral standards”
in order to return Davidson to
top rankings. He strongly
believes in academics and
athletics, and does not appear
to be bothered by the contro-
versial high academic stan-
dards.
Academics do _ concern

Pritchett, and he feels perfor-

mance in the class room and

on the courts goes hand in
hand.

From his experiences at
Maryland he recalls ‘“‘every
good student has always been
the best player; their off-court
dedication is reflected in their
on-court dedication.’’ He cites
Lenny Elmore, Tom McMil-

lan (Rhodes Scholar) and more
recently John Lucas, and Mo
Howard as examples of good
students and players.

Pritchett would prefer to
have players who are good
students, because he feels “‘the
better the student, the more
effort, concentration and dis-
cipline will be shown on the
court.”

“If a player could not be
accepted as a regular student,
I would not want him on my
basketball team,” he said.

“You don’t build a program
with junior college players,”
said Pritchett. However he did
add if a qualified junior college
player was available, he would
try to recruit him.

Recruiting is the top pri-

comments by various profes-

sors did not bother the new
coach. He felt this kind of

@tension goes on at any aca-

demic school, and said, ‘‘those
things tend to get blown way

‘out of proportion.”

He added that people don’t

fget carried away with this
basic tension between athle-
tics and academics here at
Davidson.

No timetable for the re-

emergence of a_ national

powerhouse is being set by
Pritchett. He does not want
any undue pressure placed on
his players.

“T don’t want to come in
here and be wild-eyed and say
we are going to win national
championships and be in the
top ten, but if I did not believe
we would not eventually end
up there, I would not have
come to Davidson.”

Pritchett said, “I am going
to do everything I can each
day to move towards our goal,
and all I ask is that my
players, the faculty, students,
community of Davidson and
the city of Charlotte be patient
and solid with their support.’’

Pritchett has no regrets
about leaving Maryland, and
he certainly seems to be doing-
everything possible to insure
that no one will regret the day
he was hired as the new
Davidson basketball coach.
