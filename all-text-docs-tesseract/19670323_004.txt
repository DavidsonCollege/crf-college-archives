EO NOTE: This is the third
in a series of four articles on
the proposed faculty constitu-
tion by Mike Bates. This week
Bates examines the proposals
for faculty control of David-
son’s athletic program.

By MIKE BATES
Editorial Correspondent

The proposed draft of the fac-
ulty constitution would give the
faculty complete control, subject
to trustee approval, of David-
son's intercollegiate athletic pro-
gram. The control would be ex-
ercised by a 10-man elective
committee of the faculty. The
President. the Dean of the Fac-
ulty and the Director of Athletics
would be ex officio members.

Presently the faculty has .al-
most no voice in athletic policy-
making. The Director of Athlet-
ics reports to the Dean of the
Faculty who reports to the Pres-
ident. The only authority the
present Faculty Committee on
Athletics has is the right to a

prove intercollegiate schedules.

The trustees have given this
committee two additional du-
ties: approving student eligibil-
ity for participation in intercol-
legiate athletics and serving in
a liaison capacity between the
Athletic Department and the fac-
ulty. However, the Davidson Col-
lege Self-Study Report observed,
“The policy-making function of
the Faculty Committee is more
theory than fact’ (p. 238).

The proposed draft would ex-
tend faculty contro! to include
every phase of the college’s ath-
letic program. The committee
would have full control over the
number of intercollegiate con-
tests and the specific opponents
selected. The committee would
“set standards for the eligibility
of student participants."’ Poli-
cies for intramural athletics and
physical education would be
made by the faculty committee.

The proposed draft says. ‘‘This
Committee shall be the major
organ of the Faculty in éxercis-

ing the required ‘Faculty con-
trol of all phases of intercollegi-
ate athletics.’ (Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Secondary
Schools, Standard 13.)°" This
quotation is from the 1961 edi-
tion of the Southern Associa-
tfon’s standards. It is not found
in the current edition, although
the latter does say that “‘the
athletic program of the college
shall be organized under facul-
ty supervision.”
The—National_Collegiate—Ath-
letic Association's regulation
simply calls for ‘institutional
control of, and responsibility for,
all collegiate sports. .. ."
Director of Athletics Tom
Scott is strongly opposed to the
proposed duties of the Commit-
tee on Athletics. He feels that
the faculty is not qualified to ex-
ecute the duties the proposed
constitution gives the commit-
tee. Scott said. ‘‘I don't think
they should establish policy on
something they are ignorant
about."’ Scott claims that there

31 Prospects Attend

Thirty-one select applicants to

scholarships before that time.
The amount of aid they are giv-
en varies according to their fi-
nancial need. .
‘However. if they do not have
any finaneial difficulties, they
automatically receive an honor-
ary scholarship.’ he added.
Scholarship Weekend has been

held for the past 18 years. ‘‘We
took care of all their expenses
while they were here at the col-
lege."’ said White. ‘‘A Davidson
student was assigned to each
finalist. They ate in the frater-
nity houses and the Union. went
to classes and met with faculty
members.”

“Each finalist has already s °
been accepted.” said H. Ed-| e era ion esigna es

‘ing with other excellent schools
to get the finalists to matricu-

be unrealistic to hope that all of
them will come here. However. |

In addition. Davidson's spun-
sor. Miss Merille Jones of
Queens College. was named Miss
Young Republican of North Car-
olina.

As a result of the convention
elections, in which Jim MacNair
was elected treasurer, of the
College Council and Ben Gar-
rett elected Regional: Director.
Davidson's YRC has the largest
number of elected officers on
the executive committee of the
College Council.

The major action of the con-
vention was the withdrawal of
‘he College Council from the
North Carolina Federation. In

the past the federation has been
composed of county clubs, high
school clubs and college campus
clubs. The withdrawal of the
campus clubs was prompted by
grievances which have arisen
over the past several years.

“The federation, which has not
provided benefits to, the College
Council that justify expendi-
tures. has continually harassed
College Counci} leadership,”
stated Joe Beard, President of
the Davidson YRC.

Over the last three years. the
College Council has maintained
its membership strength, while
the federation has decreased in
membership from 40 to 15 clubs.
The withdrawal of the College
Council further reduced the fed-
eration membership by one half.

The College Council will main-
tain its affiliation with the Na-

is faculty control of intercollegi-
ate athletics right now. mainly
because he answers to the Dean
of the Faculty. Hearing of this
statement, a faculty member
tersely replied, “The Dean is
not the faculty.”

Proposed Constitution Gives
Faculty Control Over Athletics

Many students feel that there
is a very obvious need for stu-
dent representation on this com-
mittee. Membership on the Ath-
letic Council, whose role is pure-
ly advisory, is simply insuffi-
cient.

Frist’s Petition Fails
To Meet Expectations

Senior Tom Frist’s petition
proposing draft exemption for
non-combat service has failed
to muster the response its orig-
inator had anticipated.

Frist, who started circulating
the petition two weeks ago, last
night reported 360 signers, ‘‘a
really surprising lack of re-
sponse.”’

The petition, which proposes
exemption for persons serving
in organizations like the Peace
Corps, will be sent to President

tional Federation through mem- | Johnson.

bership in the National College
Republican Committee.

‘I was really surprised at the
lack of response,"’ Frist said.

“This is probably one of the
least radical proposals concern-
ing the draft we could have
had.”

He attributed the poor re
sponse to student indifference to
the draft and poor coordination
by the petition’s sponsors.

He said he plans to include
with the petition a letter ex-
plaining these hindering factors.

“I hope the fact that the stu-
dents who did sign cared enough
to express their opinions will be
more important than the total
number of signatures on the pe-
tition.”

OF MEN AND MONKEYS

Under the sponsorship of Piedmont Univer-
sity Center, Dr. Alfred S. Romer, Agassiz
professor emertius of zoology at Harvard Uni-
versity, spoke Monday night on the evolution
of man from primative tree dwellers. Romer
pointed out that because man developed from
monkeys and apes, man possesses hands with
opposable thumbs — a fortunate ocurrence.
Asking his audience if they could visualize
humen mentality in an animal without hands,
such as a horse, Romer emphasized the im-
portance of man’s having usable hands. Be-

Ivy League schools and the
northeastern liberal arts col-
leges meet in New York to
discuss their overlapping fi
nancial aid applicants and how
much aid they will be offered.
“This is an effective means
of evaluating the candidates
for admission.”’ he ‘said.

Discussing student agitation
for change in the college.
Ward commented. “There is
always tension between stu-
dents and faculty. Student dis-
cohtent- and faculty discontent
keeps the school moving. But
the gap between the two
groups should be joined be-
fore it becomes antagonism.
We must keep dialogue and
yet maintain action.”

Ward opined, “I think one of
the products of a liberal edu-
cation is that there is a turn-
ing in on itself of education.
a self-examination. We listen
to the students, We have some
sense that they have diverse
talent and backgrounds and
may have something to say.
We don't, however, think that
student opinion is the fountain
of wisdom."

Greason observed that “‘stu-
dents are invariably impa-
tient. They engage the college
at a particular point in time.
There are obligations the col-
lege has prior to their coming
and after their leaving. There
is a tendency to push against
authority. Also a comfortable
impersonalizing of the admin-
istration. These are problems
that make dialogue difficult.”

treat is not designed to be a

he added.

Although certain students and
faculty members will be individ-
ually invited to participate in
panel discussions and other ac-
tivities. the retreat is open to
all students and faculty wishing
to attend.

Hunt said that he hoped that
a wide range of viewpoints
would be represented including

those of the ROTC and the con-

scientious objector.

The retreat activities will be-
gin that Saturday afternoon and
will conclude following lunch on
Sunday. In addition to panel dis-
cussions, certain relevant tape
recordings will be used to stim-
ulate discussion. and general
“bull sessions” will be encour-
aged.

The concept of the student-
faculty retreat has been devel-
oped by a committee which has
been working to find new ways
for the church to play a more
active part in student life.
