Delmar expresses doubts
about yearbook publication

By BRAD SWALWELL
Staff Writer

The 1974-75 edition of the
Davidson College yearbook,
Quips and Cranks, is not sched-
uled for distribution anytime in
the near future, according to a
spokesman for the Delma
Printing Company.

The spokesman for the Del-
mar Company, which prints
Quips and Cranks, stated that
the company had not received
very much of the yearbook
material.

“What we have is a very
insignificant portion of the mat-
erial for the annual,” said the
Delmar official.

The company spokesman said
that the company had not
contacted the yearbook editor
Carroll Ensley about the mis-
sing material. However,
College Business -. Manager
Robert Currie was contacted by
the printing company.

“Delmar will let. me know
when the rest of the material
arrives,” said Currie.

Currie wrote Ensley, a 1975
Davidson graduate, a letter
during the summer. Ensley did
not respond to Currie’s letter.

Peter Goodman, staff photo-
grapher for Quips and Cranks,
who still has many pictures in
his possession for the missing
volume, explained the problem.

“Carvoll (Ensley) had a lot of
ideas for the yearbook, but he
wanted to keep the production
of the book flexible. He felt that

structuring the production ©

would Kill some of the crea-
tivity of the yearbook ”

“To keep the production
process flexible, Carroll did not

appoint a photography editor,
He also delayed the appoint-

‘ment of editors for the various

sections of the book, such as
faculty, students, sports, and
so forth, until he had assessed
the creativity of each of his
staff members,” continued
Goodman.

“Consequently, with all the
flexibility, combined with the
Davidson students’ apathy, no-
body did anything,” said Good-
man.

Goodman went on to outline
some« of the problems the
yearbook staff encountered last
year. Some of the editors of the
various sections did not know
until the second or third week
in March how many pages their
particular section would have.

“The photography  assign-
ments were not made until the
second week in April. For
months before 1 could not find
out anything about what kind of
pictures Carroll wanted. All of
a sudden, I got my assignment
and he wanted them within

three days,” Goodman said.
Goodman attempted to tele-

phone Ensley this summer to

tell him that the pictures were

ready, only to find that Ensley

had moved.
“I mailed him a _ Special
Delivery letter at his new

Washington address.” He nev-
er answered, so I assumed that
the address I had was wrong.

“Rather than send all my
pictures to an uncertain add-
ress, I kept them until this
fall,” said Goodman.

Goodman outlined the proc-
edures he would follow this fall
to-get the pictures to Ensley.
Within the week, Goodman will
get his pictures to Frazier.
Marsh, who has been in contact
with Ensley. Marsh will get the
material to Ensley.

The spokesman for the Del-
mar Printing Company would

not speculate as to how long Jit |

would take to get the yearbook
ready for delivery once they
had all the material.

Ensley was not available for
comment.

Roving Kuralt raves on small towns

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Managing Editor

“Eating in America is a
problem. Eating well in Amer-
ica is a stupendous problem.
This is because the people in
America are more interested in
eating quickly than in eating
well. ‘9

“So besides having our nor-
mal course of chili and beer, we
join everybody else and have
our share of Big Macs,” com-

mented CBS correspondent
Charles Kuralt during his visit
to the Davidson College campus
Tuesday and Wednesday.

And if anyone ought to know
about the eating habits of small
town America, or any of their
other habits for that matter, it
would be this 41-year old
newsman who gave up a desk
and regular workday for an old
travel van and numerous hours
on the road.

EYE ON AMERICA: Charles Kurait tells student journalists how to
thumb a ride onto the road of a broadcasting career.

|

Kuralt ,entertained a Love
Auditorium audience with stor-
ies and, opinions about the
heartland of America...the
people who live in small towns
and on the back roads. Unlike
most reporters who hunt down
headline stories, Kuralt looks
for the simple aspects of Amer-
ican life.

From his observations, Kur-
alt has come to believe that
America is growing in _ its

- conception and actualization of

goodness and humanity. He
feels that the nation’s sense of
justice is stronger than ever
before.

The Wilmington, N.C. native
declined to expound on the
subjects typically asociated
with well-known journalists

- such as Watergate, the econo-
.mie crisis and the like. And in

his amusing way, he claimed no
authority from which to make
such comments, since he
“missed most of the big news
events of recent years” because
he was located in some obscure
village working’on an “On the
Road” segment.

But there is more to Charles
Kuralt than simply his amiable
personality which enabled him
to become the first and most
famous roving correspondent
surveying the grassroots of the
country. He is, in his own
right, a highly skilled and
capable reporter and journalist.

His long career began during
this college years at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, where he was
editor of the Daily Tar Heel.

“I found myself dropping

“ courses so that I could spend

more time on the Tar Heel
...until I found»that ‘by the
spring term of my senior year, I
had dropped them all,” he
reminisced. .

Following his graduation,
Kuralt remained in the Old
North State, taking a position
with the Charlotte News.
There, at the age of 22, his
“People” column won him a
major writing award, which led
to a job with CBS News.

He moved up the CBS hier- -
archy, rising to the position of
Latin American correspondent.
Speaking of his two years at
that post, Kuralt noted that it
was a cutthroat situation.

Everyday, he said, you are
wondering if that guy from
NBC is getting an interview
with the President of Brazil
while you are still in bed
sleeping or following through
what turns out to be a dead
lead.

But Kuralt continued to excel
and soon became the CBS Los
Angeles Bureau Chief, super-
vising news coverage of nine
western states.

Eight years ago, however,
the stocky newsman was
granted permission (after his
second request) to begin a
three-month trial project that
turned out to be the beginning
of the “On the Road” series. As
he noted with a grin, “The time
period got extended some-
where along the way.”

The present van which the
crew occupies is only two years
old, although it has over
115,000 miles to its credit. The
