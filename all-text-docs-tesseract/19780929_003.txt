Cup drive begins

Beginning Monday, September 2, all students eating at Slater
are requested to bring their own cups for drinks. At present, 17,500
cups are used at Slater each week, which averages out to 3.5 cups
per person per meéal.

Director of Slater Food: Services Ron Scott has agreed to donate
one‘cent for every cup under the 17,500 cup standard per week. The
proceeds will go to CROP, which fights world hunger. The program
worked quite well last year, as students managed to earn over
$1400, or $90 per week, for CROP.

The drive hopes to reduce waste in addition to raising money, ‘as
well as raising the general level of awareness regarding
conservation measures. ~

Dorm lounges refurbished

When Student Housing Director Scotty Nicholls refurbished the
lounges in the dorms this summer, she purposefully failed to restore
them to their former elaborateness.

Several year's ago, Nicholls had instructed the Physical Plant to

’ furnish the rooms with such niceties as ash trays, lamps, plenty of
furniture, and original paintings.

Many of these accomodations were omitted from this year’s
renovation project because students have been so irresponsible with
them in the past. Ash trays quickly disappeared, lamps were
overturned, and pictures were defaced: Many chairs and tables
found their way into students’ private rooms.

Nicholls said that to provide a maximum of furnishings would be
futile. If the students want the lounges to be more completely
accomdated in the future, they will have to demonstrate /more
maturity.

“The first step in making the lounges look better is to educate the
students in how to take care of them and act responsibly when
they’re in them,’’ Nicholls remarked.

Residence Hall Association President John Jackson emphasized
that students must face up to the fact that damaging and stealing of
the furnishings in the ries! eg is a violation of the Code of

Responsibility.

..UNCC’s Vice Chancellor Orr says
there’ S room for both radio stations

(Continued from page 1)

Spencer said last week, ‘‘I think what we need to do is to get
our own situation clarified first before we start elsewhere.”

Orr, on the other hand, said he’s ready to talk to Davidson
officials about coordinating their stations so that they do not
step on each other’s broadcasting toes.

“We would very much like to coordinate and cooperate
with Davidson, not only concerning the radio station, but on
a number of fronts,”’ he said.

But having read the papers, Orr said he realizes many
Davidson students are angry about WDAV’s future and that
this may not be the best time for the talks to take place. _

“T realize you have a'sensitive issue over there:and:I think
we should get together when Davidson's ready ,”’ said Orr.

At least when it comes ‘to cooperating, WDAV and
WFAE’s station managers seem to be way ahead of the two

Willis Hones Hobbs, 53 ad
Gordon Alfred Phillips, Jr., 41,
both of, Mount ‘Mourne, : were,
charged with impersonation ofa
police officer, carrying a con-
cealed weapon, possession of a
weapon on public or private |
school grounds, and trespas-
sing.

Hobbs and Phillips were dri-
ving a 1972 Ford Pinto ‘station-
wagon, when stopped by Da-
vidson College Security Officer
Gussie Latta at the corner of
Main Street and Martin Manor
September 25 at six forty-five

‘p.m.

A pair of handcuffs were
dangling from the rear view
mirror and a simulated .45
caliber automatic—actually a
gas-powered pellet gun- was
lying on the dashboard, stated
arresting officer R. H. Cloanin-
ger. He said both men were
wearing wraparound sun-
glasses.

According to Cloaninger, the
two men told Latta they were
special deputy sheriffs and
showed her a false badge.
Further search identified them
as Hobbs and Phillips.

Among the contents. of the
car were eight .38 caliber bul-
lets, one 14 inch lead pipe, two
handkerchiefs secured to the
door handles, 44 .32 caliber
bullets, one dead squirrel, one
half-gallon urine, seventeen
cans of beer, two containers of
K-Y jelly, a loaded .32 caliber
Colt. Revolver concealed under
the console, and the gas-po-
wered pistol in a deputy sheriff
holster.

Hobbs and Phillips alledged-
ly said they were carrying the
weapons “‘to deter crime.’’

Hobbs, when arrested,
claimed to be a Davidson gra-
duate. Mrs. Nancy Blackwell of

the Alumni Office confirmed he-

graduated from Davidson in

1947 with a B.S. degree.
According to Alumni records,

Hobbs transferred to Davidson

‘from Wak Forest University in’

1945, where he had participated
in Little Theatre; Phi Society,

and the Methodist Club. He

subsequently received a M.A.

Great strides are being made
in Davidson’s. 1987 fund-raising
program, according to Vice
President for Development
Duane Dittman.

Dittman said $8.6 million has
already been pledged to the
program and that $5.1 million
of that has already been re-
ceived.

The program’s goal, set in
1975, is to raise $35 million by
Davidson’s 150th anniversary
nine years from now.

According to Dittman, a
fund-raising schedule is set up
each year. “In the last fiscal
year, we raised $3,428,000. This
was the most successful fund-
raising year in the college’s
history,’’ he said.

Usually summer is a fund-
raiser’s lean season,
to Dittman, but this hasn’t held
true for the.1987 program.

Numerous pledges and grants.

from the S.S. Kresge Founda-
tion, Proctor and Gamble, and
others have been received by
the Development Office since
the opening of the new fiscal
year.

Dittman reported that the

‘incidents have not. turned into

serious. We know it’s
ered to happen sometime
though.”

He said he was expecially
worried about women running
alone on the cross country trail.

According to Mills; women
have been approached but no
serious incident has resulted so

““Women think ‘it’ll never
happen. here’ but it can and
does.”

1987 makes progress

Kresge grant, which pledged
$200,000 to the College, was the
largest of the summer grants.

According to Dittman, the
first construction program tied
to the 1987 program, the Martin
Science Building’s renovation,
already begun—with
$725,000 already spe to
finance it.

Most of the. funds uiiieids
through the 1987 program will
be used to increase the endow-
ment, help finance construction
projects, and provide regular
‘operating expenses.

Since the program was be-
gun, inflation has pushed up
college expenses so far that the
original $35 million goal may
havé to ‘be raised to meet
Davidson’s needs, according to
Dittman.

“The goals that were origin-
ally set three years ago haven’t
been changed, but it’s clear
they will have to be changed,”
said Dittman.
