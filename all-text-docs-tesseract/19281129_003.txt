Thirteen Wildcats Play
Last Game On Thursday

When the Wildcats trot out on the field
Thursday with them will go thirteen men
who for the last time will signal that the
Wildcats are there and ready to fight.
This number includes four backfield men,
two centers, and seven tackles.and guards.
The backfield men are: Kell, Flinn, Cov-
ington, and Black. The linemen are:
Middleton, and Archie, tackle, Baker, tac-
kle, Leftwich, tackle, Harper, guard, R.
McConnell, center, Kerr, Center, Hill,
guard, Smith, guard. .

All of these are not regulars, but all
have given of their best upon the prac-
tice field and upon the gridiron when the
opportunity is given them. Nor is it al-
ways the regulars that make the team,
it is the ones that go out each day in order
that the varsity may run over them.
Whatever is said, the least that can be
said is that thitteen true Wildcats are lost
to the football team when the game Thurs
day is over.

A leading bridge expert once said, “The
aces and kings play themselves; it’s the little
spots that make games.”

What's true in bridge seems equally true in
the cigarette business. Aces to deuces, spades
to clubs—from the very first deal, Chesterfield
made every card good!

No risky finesses, no sharp double squeezes
— Chesterfield rose to world-wide popularity

by stizight honest selling with a straight honest
product — an outstanding success in cigarette
history.

So Chesterfield can bid high/. Tobacco qual-
ity, perfect blending, purity, mildness, natural
sweetness — with a hand like that, Chestérfield
can redouble your smoking pleasure...and to-
day, next month, next yeat, keep right on ful-
filling the contract.
