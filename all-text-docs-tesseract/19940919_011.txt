Donna Peters returns to give one-woman show

By James Berry

It’s always inspiring to hear of
a Davidson graduate’s success, if
only because it indirectly means
that those of us still here have some
chances ourselves.

In the case of Donna Peters,
we have more than enough reason
to be encouraged. On September

‘22 at 8 p.m., Peters will return to

campus to perform a work of her
own, entitled The Hoffman Hotel.
The event will take place in Hodson
Hall of the Cunningham Fine Arts
building. Tickets are $2 for the
general public and free for

Davidson ID holders.

The play isbasedonablendof *

personal experience and her par-
ents’ stories surrounding an Ala-
bama gathering place, which gives
the piece its name.

Peters takes on all the roles of
her characters in the one hour per-
formance. According to Peters, all
the characters are real people, with
no names changed from reality to
script.

Joe Gardner, chairman of the
theater and speech departments,

says, “The play is a loving and”

comic look at the characters we

find in small towns everywhere.”

Peters graduated 4from
Davidson in 1989 with a degree in
English. She then went on to the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and became the first
Davidson graduate to earn a Mas-
ter of Fine Arts in acting from that
school.

Since leaving Davidson, she
has founded the Indian Spring Sum-
mer Stock Theater in Birmingham,
Alabama, which has been operat-
ing since 1989.

She has also instructed some
classes at Chapel Hill, appeared in

Watson Fellowship offers money for adventure and travel

By Jennifer Kerns

Every year, Davidson picks
four students to compete in the
Watson Foundation Fellowship
competition. The Watson Fellow-
ship program, founded in 1968,
provides selected students with
$15,000 in study abroad money for
a year-long project. Davidson was
one of the founding 25 schools to
participate.

Sara Carlson, Davidson’s
Watson representative, states that
52 schools now compete in the

national competition. The Fellow-
ship is open to anyone who gradu-
ated from one of the participating
colleges, with no citizenship re-
quirements. There is no GPA cut-
off, either. ““You don’t need to be
onthe Honor Roll-only motivated.”

The projects usually fall un-
der four general catergories:
women’s studies, development,
biology, and business and finance.
Carlson emphasizes that there is
no pressure to choose-a particular
field of study. She researched na-

tive ponies of the North Atlantic
Islands, discussing how similar
breeds will diverge into different
breeds. After several months, she
branched out, looking at the “hu-
man interrelationship with live-
stock”. Last year’s recipient, David
Tweety, studies "the origins of Ap-
palachian fiddle music in the Shet-
land Islands.”

What advice does Carlson give
to candidates? “The most impor-
tant advice I can give is to pick a
project that suits you. You must

live with your project for one year,
and it could be miserable if you
don’t love what you do.”

Dr. Ortmayer of the Davidson
Watson committee emphasizes the
continued success of Davidson stu-
dents in the national competition.

On average, two of four represen- -

tatives are chosen. When asked
what the committee wants, he says,
“We are looking for interesting
people, with interesting projects,
who are compelled to do those
things.”

Senior Anni Kirkland featured in Glamour

By Ashlyn Dannelly

People flipping through the
pages of Glamour magazine’ s Oc-
tober issue may be surprised to see
a Davidson face tucked away in
the back pages. Senior Anni
Kirkland received an Honorable
Mention in Glamour’s “Top Ten
College Women” essay contest.

Ten women received $1,000
scholarships and a chance to travel

to Washington D.C. and interview
a woman of their choice. Kirkland
was one of five women receiving
Honorable Mention.

Kirkland says, "The real rea-
son I entered the contest was to get
the chance to interview someone
really fascinating, like Ruth Bader-
Ginsburg.” While she did not re-
ceive money or an interview op-
portunity, Kirkland’ s photo and de-

scriptive information appear in the
publication.

The contest focused on
womens’ academic achievements
and leadership. Kirkland entered
the contest after Assistant Dean of
Students Leslie Marsicano pre-
sented the idea to her.

Kirkland says, "I don’t even
subscribe to any magazines like
Glamour, but I was impressed that

light the real achievements of
women... at first, [thought, “Glam-
our magazine, no way.’ But then I
was glad they were showing real
role models, not women who are
100 pounds and five feet ten.”

Kirkland says she included her
thoughts about magazines’ dam-
aging portrayals of women in her
essay: “Maybe that’s why they
picked me.” Although disappointed
she did not win, she is "surprised
that I got that far. The women that
won are really impressive.”
