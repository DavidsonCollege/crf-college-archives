Tuesday Davidson College’s
swimming team scored an

upset with a surprise 56-55
victory over powerful Appala-
chian State. Added with Fri-
day’s 68-44 victory over the
College at Charleston and
Saturday’s 68-45 defeat of The
Citadel, the swimming team’s
record now stands at an
outstanding 10-4.

“The Appalachian victory
was the best I’ve had in
coaching,’’ said Coach Pat
Miller, ‘‘but then we really
worked for it. We knew it
would take our best effort to
win, and we came through.”

Four pool records were bro-
ken in Tuesday’s meet, and
Davidson swimmers set three
new school records. Mark
Tommerdahl smashed the pool
and his own school record of
2:06.3 and 2:07.9 respectively
with a time of 2:03.8 in the 200
yard butterfly.

Jonathan Washburn broke
two of his own school records,
with a 2:05.5 in the 200 yard
individual medley, and a
2:19.27 in the 200 yard breast-
roke. An Appalachian swim-
mer broke the pool record in
the 100, 200 and 500 yard
freestyle.

“The records don’t tell the

Swimmers splash
in recent contest

whole story,”’ said Coach Mil-
ler, ‘although swimmers like
Mark and Jonathan are set-
ting records, all our swimmers
are doing their best times ever
—Like Marshall Brown, who
also broke the school record in
the 200 fly. Or John Frederick,
or Skip Barkley, who came
through with a second in the
back that we needed to win.
We are talented, and won with
real team effort.”’

A crucial factor in the final
tally was the scoring in the
diving. Since Davidson has no
diving facilities, the coaches
compared the scores of their
divers. ASU’s divers were
awarded two first places (10
points) and Davidson two
second places (6 points) in-
stead of Davidson losing 16
points as they usually do. ““‘We
decided that was most fair,’’
said Coach Miller.

Captain Mike Knowles said,
‘‘We’ve been working really
hard since the first week of
school. Coach Miller has done
a super job. She set up a good
line up for this meet.”

“It was a big win— ASU
beat Furman, and we lost to
Furman by 20. It was a super
team effort, and we are getting
better. We only won four last
year and we are already 10-4
this year,’’ Knowles said.
