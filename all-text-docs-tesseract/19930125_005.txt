1993 SGA ELECTIONS

SGA VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

Editor's Note: The Davidsonian asked the candidates for Student Government Vice-President to
respond to four questions regarding their candidacy.
(1) What are your qualifications for the job of SGA Vice-President?
(2) If elected, what will be your primary interests/goals as SGA Vice-President?

(3) As SGA Vice-President, how do you plan to work with the SGA President and the SGA
body as a whole to get things done? |

(4) Why do you want to be SGA Vice-President?

I admit it: I was apathetic.
That seems to be the biggest politi-

cal buzzword on campus lately,
and I believe there is good reason
for that. It is certainly a word that
describes my state of mind as a
freshman. You see, in high school
I served as class president for four
years on a fairly active Student
Council that made several signifi-
cant changes in life at our school.
When I arrived at Davidson, I de-
cided that I had put in my time
already, that I wasn’t needed, and
that I would be happier just taking
a passive role. In reality, I had
become apathetic. Gradually, how-
ever, I began to notice problems

aroundcampus, things that affected -

all of us. More and more often I
found myself wanting to make
changes in life at Davidson.
This is why I decided torun. I
know how to serve, how to work

with committees, and how to get
thing done. I have experience and
ability. More importantly, Ihavea
strong desire to be a part of SGA.
Iam willing to work hard to make
improvements in life on this cam-
pus. I feel that this desire is my
greatest qualification.

One of the problems that I
strongly feel needs to be addressed
is that of the ever-shortening exam
period. I feel that the exam period
has slowly become too short to
allow any semblance of schedule
autonomy. The tradition of self-
scheduled exams is one that sets
Davidson apart from other schools.
I consider it a privilege granted to
us by the Honor Code, and I hate to
see it gradually taken away. One
option that I would like to pursue
which might alleviate some of the

pressure, for the short term at least,
is tooffera nighttime exam period.
This, I think, would give people
some much needed flexibility in
their exam schedules.

Another problem that deserves
a lot of attention is the role of the
College Union in the social life at
Davidson. Davidson has a some-
what limited number of entertain-
ment options simply by virtue of
its rural location. On weekends,
the Court parties cannot keep ev-
eryone entertained all the time:
Weekdaysareeven more of aprob-
lem this year, because of the new
limits placed on the number of
weekday parties.

Aschool like Davidson has an
acute need for an active, dynamic,
and entertaining Student Union.
Anotherconcernof mine is that the

new Alcohol Policy comes up for
re-evaluation this spring, and I feel
that several improvements can re-
alistically be made that would
greatly improve the situation on
the Court. One point that I feel
needs attention is the regulation on
the number of weekday parties
which has left most weeknights
withoutany options forrefuge form
dorm life. Even if Patterson Court
can not offer a great deal of variety
of activities to students, itcan give
people a much needed break form
work and a chance to socialize.

Another point that needs re-
consideration is that parties are
shut down earlier this year despite
the fact that people’s bed times
have not changed. Ona few occa-

(1)Having been continually in-
volved in the SGA since Septem-
ber of my freshman year, I now

seek the Vice Presidency of the
Student Government Association.

As a senator, I have concen-
trated my efforts behind a number
of tasks. On the request of a fac-

ulty member and several students, - -

I worked one-on-one with -the
Chairman of the English Depart-
ment and successfully lobbied for
journalism to be incorporated into
a writing class.

In response to the library’s
former weekend closing times—
midnight on Fridays and 6 p.m. on
Saturdays—I coordinated a new
schedule with the Library Director
that, according to students’ reac-
tions, better suits our needs.

I have continually met with the
Dean of Students to push for ex-
tending the hours of the Baker
Sports Complex. Our persistent
pressure on Baker’s administra-

tors has resulted in the gym closing
at 7 p.m. on weekend evenings
rather than 6 p.m., but there is
much more work to be done.

As the appointed head of the
Trustee Contact Committee, I have
sought to strengthen communica-
tion between students and the most
powerful group of Davidson
policy-makers. Remarks I and
other students in the program have
received from our Trustee liaisons
support the notion that they value
and heed our opinions, and that
this program is continually grow-
ing stronger.

I will use the relationships I’ve
established with several of the
school’s influential leaders, as well
as the invaluable experience I’ve
obtained through working with
them, to strengthen my role as Vice
President.

(2)Communication: Student apa-
thy is of great concern to me; an
organization representing an in-
different body is merely represent-
ing itself. The weekly “SGA Min-
utes” alone are not the answer to
the problem, for most students
never get to sce them.

If elected, every student who
wishes to remain informedon SGA
doings will have the opportunity to
doso. Asan initial step, we will let
each student know at the outset of
the term what we hope to accom-
plish over the course of the year.
Everyone will know when. and
where the Student Government
Association meets, who their rep-
resentatives are, and how their
opinions can be heard.

Also, we will familiarize you on
a regular basis with the issues cur-

rently being discussed by our body.
This can be done through exten-
sive articles in the Davidsonian, or
through flyers under each person’s
door. By this token, no policy will
be passed without your informed
input.

Thave discussed these ideas with
the presidential candidates, and
they have both agreed to pursue
this course of action. Itis my hope
that you will eventually use the
SGA for its primary purpose—to
serve your needs.

Harmony: I will not serve a stu-
dent body that is not tolerant to-
wards its fellow students.. If you
are prejudiced in any way, I donot
want your vote. It’s just thatsimple.

We must push for greater diver-
sity on campus. Out of over 2100

1. I believe anyone in the position

of VP should have a strong knowI-
edge of the workings behind the
SGA in order to know what he/she
can accomplish. I have actively
served as Freshmen class Presi-
dentand Junior Class Senator, both
which have given me insight into
the workings and responsibilities
of the SGA. I served on the Stu-
dent Executive Committee which
advises the SGA President and
plans agendas. The Vice President
is responsible for the SGA stand-
ing committees and appoints the
chairperson for these committees.
I have served twice as a chairper-
son for the Phonathon Committee
and have been a member of the
Trustee Contact Committee where

_ I keep my trustee informed about

the issues around campus so that

he can make decisions based on
student feeling.: Ihave alsoserved
on the CCRL which is a Student/
Faculty committee the Vice Presi-
dent helps organize. Currently, I
serve as Co-Chair on the Council
on Academic Affairs which has
enabled me to work with faculty
on issues such as drop/add, minus
grades, the school calendar, and
optional class days. 1 also serve on
the Alcohol Policy ad hoc commit-
tee which has analyzed the alcohol
policy and is writing a report rec-
ommending changes. This year I
have also been in charge of the.
Student/Faculty Roundtables
which enable students and faculty
to gather and focus on a certain
issue around the dinner table in a

‘non-academic setting. As a hall

counselor this year, I have also
witnessed firsthand the viewpoints
of the freshmen who will be here
for three more years and know I
could represent them. I feel it is
important that I am the only Junior
running for this position because I
have witnessed the major changes
Davidson has undergone in the past
three years and can understand
student’s dissatisfaction with as-
pects of Davidson life. Ihave been
working towards this position since
Freshman year and believe my
qualifications will make the VP
role one that will work for the
students and not just be a figure-
head.

2. I believe apathy is a huge prob-
lem on campus and feel that this

problem is linked to a lack of com-
munication and student input in
school policy. One of the VP’s
main duties is to find from the
student population effective com-
mittee heads for the standing com-
mittees of the SGA. These com-
mittees are a vital part of the SGA
but they are so often forgotten. By
now, committees such as the Secu-
rity Committee and Campus Ser-
vices and Facilities Committee
should have pushed through better
lighting on campus and the build-
ing of kiosks that could be placed
in the center of campus as an infor-
mation source. The SGA needs to
make these committees a viable
part of the SGA so that they are not
