‘THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 27, 1924

Big Brown Bus Brings Bevy of
Beautiful Belles Before Boys

A-cbig motor hig oes: of the type that sail ae

ily and indifferently along the beautiful paved
highways of North Carolina, drove into Da-
vidson last Thursday,

lowed by a flurry of excitement such as

seldom penetrates the tranquillity of the!

ancient little village. Even the recent ap-

pearance of the “Shenandoah”—the big U. S. |

Army Zeppelin—failed to cause such a thrill
among the peace-loving students of this
antique, yet modern college. But, it wasn’t
the bus, its awe-inspiring magnitude, nor its
shekish young pilot that sent such ecstacies
of emotion running, rampant through the

mass of students that crowded the sidewalks |

of Main Street.

Rather, it was the valuable and welcomed |
cargo that the big bus had transported from
Charlotte—a cargo whose intrinsic value was
realized and appreciated before the modern
Leviathan of the highways had dashed
breathlessly toa standstill. The doors of the
bus opened suddenly, and from within the
mysterious depths on its tonneau poured
forth a multitude of humans, of ethereal
beauty and of the sex more commonly con-
ceded to be the sillier.

They had come to Davidson, after an ex-
tensive tour through the “Old North State,”
flying the banner of the now-famous Greens-
boro College for Women and singing their
way into the hearts of all who were lucky
cnough to hear them warble. They were
members of the Greensboro College Glee
Club, and, as friend Caesar or his Roman
contemporaries would say,
saw, they conquered.”

Their performance,
gant affair,

“they came, they
a dazzling, extrava-
filled the old rafters of Shearer
Hall with an enchantment it had never
known before. The vivacious chorus, the
talented dramatists, the enthralling solosists,
brought to an expectant audience of male-
beings the very “thrill of their lives.” But,

the performance lasted only a. few hours, |

and was only one of the minor cogs in the
big machine that set Davidson afire.

Their very presence on the campus, on the
streets, in the hotel, were all instrumental
in the downfall of our aged institution.
From the small, sylph-like (2) young fresh-
woman, who sang soprano in’ the
chorus, to the: star soloist in the company,
gocs the credit for the unthought-of stibju-
gation of the Davidson students—and_ the
credit must be divided equally among the
various artists who made up the personnel
of the club,

There were only two regréts in the hearts
of the students, who heard them sing—the
first, a deep-rooted envy for Mr. Gilman F.
Alexander, who by ‘virtue of his musical ex-
cellence, was chosen to accompany the girls
as director and chaperone on their tour; the
second, a keen sorrow that the girls couldn't
have remained indefinitely in Davidson and
rendered their program at intervals of every
two hours,

VACATION LOOMING BIG IN
MINDS OF STUDENTS

“In the spring, a young man’s fancy,

Lightly turns to thoughts of Love.”

But now that Thanksgiving is over the
minds of the Davidson students are
buried deep in «thoughts and plans for
the approaching Christmas holidays.
Many plans are afoot and all indications
point to the fact that the Hill will be
entirely vacated.

School closes on Thursday, December
18, and closses are over at one- thiry.
This will enable the majority of the stu-
dents to reach their homes by that night,
primed for a merry Christmas.

Many plans are on foot as to mode of
travel, but the most popular to be “bum-
ming.” Many boys are pairing off and,
the minute classes are ov er, will join the
ranks of Weary Willie and Dusty Duke.
Some of the boys are more fortunate in
that their folks are planning to come to
the Hill for a few days before school is
out and drive home through the country.
The rest will resort to the trains as be-
ing the quickest way to get home.

The students, who for reason of be-
ing too far from home and are thus pre-
vented from returning for Christmas.
have plans of spending the holidays with
friends and relatives. This will enable
all to enjoy the holidays to the utmost.

Friday, the second of January, will
find the boys back in their accustomed
haunts, while some few may stay home
to enjoy a day or so of extra pleasures |
but by Monday, January 5, the whole
student body will be hard at work pre-
paring for examinations, which follow
soon after, holding in their hearts hap-
Py memories of a happy Christmas.

Literary Societies

Pandeinic Society
At the regular meeting of the Pandeinic
Literary Society it was originally planned to
have but one debate, but, due to a misunder-
standing, Steele and Garrison .prepared the

{affirmative side of the query, Resolved, That |

ithe State constabulary system should be
| adopted in the nation, while Gray and Frank-
jlin prepared the negative of Resolved, That
the R. O. T. C. department should be taken
out of the curriculum, It was finally decided
jthat Steele should take the affirmative and
| Garrison the negative side of the first query,
jand that Franklin should uphold the affirnfa-
itive and Gray the negative of the second
query. This arrangement proved very sue-
cessful. Steele won the the affirmative side
of the first query by a 3-0 vote, and Gray
j won the negative of the second query by a
12-1 vote.

L. L. Deck gave a very interesting sum-
mary of the events of the day.

Armistice Day was the very appropriate
subject of the oration ably delivered by C.
M.S. McIlwaine.

The regular weekly question for debate
was discussed at the last meeting the
Eumenean Society by W. W.

‘Thanksgiving Day
Ushers In Merry
Time On the Hill

Thanksgiving, as it chess does
son, brings with it many happy and striking
events. The same day last year, although it
was full of celebration, cannot surpass what
the students would make it this year. This

occasion, which is marked by a whole holi- |

day, and_boxes from home overflowing with |
the delicatessens of the season, promises to
be one of the most jovial occasions of the
year.

The most prominent part of this year's
Thanksgiving is of course the Davidson-
Trinity game. The students have looked
forward in many ways to this game. It is
rumored that there will be a special, which |
rumor, if correct, means that there will be a
large representation from the Wildeat king-
dom, Should there be no special, this fact
would not interfere with their expectation of
secing the game, as there are more ways
than one to get there.

And of course every fellow will get a good
Thanksgiving dinner at his boarding house
on Tuesday night as that is the time that
all the boarding houses serves that highly
welcomed meal. Then, some of the fellows
entertain the prospect of having that din-
ner at their homes. At any rate, there will
be very few at Davidson on the 27th,
who do not go to the game will probably he
found at Charlotte. Those who remain on the
Hill will perhaps join with the townspeople
in the Thanksgiving service at the chureh on
that morning,

Thg fitting climax of the
will be the week-end itself, when the campus
will be adorned with various colored frocks.
Those returning from the and other
places will perhaps bring some of these wel-

Visitors who will he the campus
the week-end parties. ‘These parties
will mark the merriest part of the whole oc-
The if it
win for Davidson, will lend to the merriment
and thankfulness the students at this
Thanksgiving time.
