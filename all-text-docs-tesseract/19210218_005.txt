Spring Fever has been a visitor on our
campus for the past few days. Every-
body tried to make his stay as enjoy-
able as possible. Old S. Fever is wetl-
known by many of our alumni who will
no doubt be interested to learn of his
continued activity (or inactivity) about
the Hill.

And Talk for a Month.
Let two women meet who use the

same patent medicine—and you have
friends for life.

announce the meeting time as 6 p. m.

Number Nine Georgia advertises col-

Greetings!

No, Susie, a bank teller isn’t an in-

Thanks, Mabel. -

The following has been received from
an awfully good-looking girl at Flora
Macdonald College. (We know she’s
good-looking for she writes such a
lovely hand.)

Mr. Peanut Parcher:,

Dear Sir:

We beg to submit the following in-
formation:

If you wish to play tennis and find
you have no equipment, stamp on the
floof and you will have a racket; punch

& | your room-mate and lo !—the balls.

Yours truly,
(Signed) Contributor.
The meth@d is. good—we worked it,

& | but it’s awfully hard on room-mates.

Yea Bot
Some one ought to start an agitation

Rito get the government to stock the
3 |campus and main street with fish.

Fact!
A distinguished Junior remarked that

w|the only way anyone could get a day off

at Davidson was to tear a leaf off the

B | calendar.

; Easy, Gertrude.
Such anonymous valentines as the fol-

- lowing might easily be conceived of as
S\starting an ugly ripple on the placid
S| waters of a contented love affair.

“Awl come off your high horse. You're

sinot the only fellow in the world!”

“Don't think I'll throw my heart at
you

Or beg for yours, unfeeling sir!

Just let this little fact sink through

I also am particular!”

Our stenographer is sick—our office
boy has struck. Good-day.

others te come out for the team. -

The military department is running

were out for practice Saturday after-

Prosperity now reigneth in Antioch,
