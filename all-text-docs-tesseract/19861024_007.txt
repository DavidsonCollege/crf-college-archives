Every Anonymous Sophomore .
These fragments I have shored against my ruins You must understand
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe. ;
Datta. Dayadvam. Damyata. I am the center of the moral universe
Shantih shantih shantih. nats .
TS. Eliot I don’t have to explain — But
I carry the It’s like this ;
pain c
of others, as the I see with my eyes
Bermuda Triangle carries the sunken H - th
mystery ear with my ears
f the missing.
onnne musing I mean it’s this way
The missing pieces of our I burn incense not for any gods
pain
and But for my nose
suffering — boos
fit into our It's nice
conscious, BNCONCIOUS . ___You see, I’m the center of this soft room
conscience,...... unconscience?

In the center of your hard world

We whisper into black holes When I say “Peace,” I mean, “Quiet, let me be

that we have asses ears;

A dogwood springs up and | I’ve given Jesus notice and walked
. . .e . . . alla:
whispers coolly into the blistering wind, _ No big words
Humanity has asses ears . . . Humanity has asses ears . . . Human-
ity. .has....” ee
-——, over and over and I think No complications
7 It speaks to me Tt’s just me
_ alone. ;
Just me
