Sex Revisited

Sex, like many other things, it
seems, is apparently being rediscov-
ered or at least reacknowledged by
Davidson College. While a letter ecise-
where on this page may raise the
suspicion that sex is not new, we have
it on the authority of our columnist
that. the Sexual Revolution is storm-
ing into the South. Since then we have
been eagerly watching the clouds for
the expected rain of sex, but all this
campus seems to get is mostly a great
deal of the hail .. . excluding the re-
cent arrivals for Spring Frolics.

Usually being twenty miles from
the nearest concentration of sexual-
ly eligible females and isolated in a
somewhat masochistic environment,
it is comforting to learn (once again
via our columnist) that sex as expres-
sion. is part of the identity crisis —
we, of course, know from experience
that when you express sex you may
also have an identity crisis. Passion as
a part of the whole man raises simi-
lar problems.

We would be ready to insist that
sex-in-practice must be a part of our
real relationships, were it not for an
admittedly time-worn anxiety that
continues, even in this age of the in-
stant contraceptive: What if she gets
pregnant?

Also it seems that the recent deluge
of prose on the ethics of sex has one
point in common, whether it views
sex as a meaningful expression of the
whole person in daily life or whether
it views sex as a necessary nuisance

Tougaloo Tougawar

The letter is probably on its way
now. But our concern with the Stud-
ent Council’s decision to enter the
Mississippi political arena is not dis-
patched as easily.

Granted, academic matters are in-
volved in the Tougaloo charter dis-
pute. Nevertheless, the matter is es-
sentially politically oriented. The
Council is attempting to persuade
political figures to act in a specific
way on legislation within the Missis-
sippi state legislature.

Our point remains: we encourage
individuals to take an active interest
in politics. On the other hand, we
bitterly oppose Council speaking as
a group in the realm of politics.

An informed political discussion is
healthy. But we question to what ex-
tent the Tougaloo charter problem
was studied by each member of Stud-

subject to Biblical authority: All of it
is written from a strictly masculine
point of view.

This point of view implies that
“real sex” is the “masculine sex” —
the male sex drive is confused with
over-all sex drive—and while sex may
be undergoing demythologizing, - the
cause of this confusion is one myth
that hasn’t been touched.

The reality is an obvious one, al-
though both our columnist and his
critics seem to have missed it: Sex for
the male is the completion of a com-
plicated physiological cycle; for the
female it is only the beginning of an
even more complex cycle. From dif-
ferent cycles come different needs
and responses.

Editorial columns are not usually
run as excerpts of modern sex man-
uals; yet the point is not the edifica-
tion of the sexually ignorant. The re-
cent furor over sex illustrates a basic
problem at Davidson: we ask the
wrong questions for the right reasons.

We seem to be arguing over the
meaning and practice of sex before
we have really discovered what is sex.
Our analysis of the problem is faulty
because we take for granted the in-
herent truth of our own presupposi-
tions. Before we dictate the ethics
and procedure for sex to our genera-
tion, a little bit more mental home-
work might be in order. .. . have an

ent Council. And what were his sourc-
es of information? Did he carefully
examine both sides? Were his sources
of information unbiased?

In addition, we question the. sinceri-
ty of each council member's concern.
We wonder how many members were
concerned enough to write a personal
letter committing no one. save him-
self. This is an individual act, an act
that does not carry the name of 1000
students with it, an act that does not
carry the weight of 1000 students
with it. But is it not a more sincere
and, consequently, more meaningful
approach?

Achievement And Underachievers

We are delighted to learn that
there exists a strong possibility that
the library’s request for a $44,000
budget increase next year will be
approved.

Often cited as a shockingly weak
aspect of the Davidson educational
framework, the library, nevertheless,
has been quietly growing and recent-
lv added its 100,000th volume.

But more is needed. Although they
have been growing numerically ab-
solutely, Davidson’s library expendi-
tures have not been increasing any
more quickly than at comparable
schools. (See chart on page six.)

If the $44,000 request is approved
—a 47 per cent increase in the li-
brary budget—the library will have
a chance to record phenomenal
growth, a chance to step ahead.

A disgusting note. Library director
Chalmers Davidson mentioned to our

reporter this week that members of
the faculty had been requested to
furnish lists of books needed in their
field not now available in the library.

We were not surprised, but none-
theless annoyed, to find that several
members of the faculty failed to sup-
ply adequate lists—some none at all
-—despite several requests from the
library staff.

The cooperation of the members of
the faculty—men familiar with the
best volumes in their respective fields
—is almost mandatory if the library
is to seek effectively both the best
and the latest books in all areas of
knowledge. Each faculty member
owes his cooperation both to the
College as his employer and to his
students as his vocation.

ee Ge eA 0 OO,

The editorial cf April 17 con-
cerning the Student. Council's
stand in the Tougaloo College
case has provided an opportu-
nity to make more explicit the
reasons behind both the Coun-
cil’s and my own support for
that action.

The council is opposed to tak-
ing political stands which have
no direct bearing on the position
which students occupy in their
role as students. Such specific
items as disarmament, the Unit-
ed States’ stand on the Panama
situation, or even the over-all in-
tegration question are all ex
amples of {issues that do not
have any direct relation to us in
our place as students.

However, there are many ‘'po
litical’’ issues which do have
much direct relevance to us jn
this role. The integration prob
lem as it may specifically ap
ply to Davidson students qua
students is a proper area in
whieh the Council: should work.

So is the situation involved
when a= state government
threatens to revoke the ch-r-
fer of an educational institu-
tion strictly on the grounds of
personat bias. Such action has
direct bearing on the part we
play as American college stu-
dents, and our Student Gov-
ernment has a definite respon-
sibility in this realm of “its
rightful representation In stu-
dent affairs.’

These stands, then, are pri-
marily concerned with the im-
portance which certain circum-
stances may have on us all as
students. and such actions are
only incidentally ‘“‘political’’ in
the over-all sense in which al-
most every issue might be so
considered.

The Student Councll’s rep-
resentation of the Student
Body has also been called into
question in your editorial. Yet
the members of the Council
have been properly chosen by
the Student Body at large,
and the representatives’ very
election signifies a degree of
the confidence and trust which
has been placed In thelr capa-
bility and judgment.

The opinions of our Student
Body as a whole are seriously
considered, and rightly so,
whenever the Student Council
endeavors to reach any deci-
sion, and yet few would even
suggest an actual plebiscite on
every question to be studied...

Will Jackson

Zon

Dear Editor.

T would like to take issue with
your April 17 editorial, ‘“‘The
‘Representatives’ Act.’’ The Stu-
dent Council is criticized for
protesting Mississippi's move to
revoke the charter of Tougaloo
College. Mississippi's only inte-
grated institution.

The editorial] states, ‘‘Al-
though academic matters are in-
volved in the Tougaloo case,
nevertheless, the problem re-
mains essentially polltical, a
product of Mississippi's racial

struggle.”’

Yet merely because the Tou-
galoo case js, in a narrow
sense “‘political,”” does this
mean that the Council must
be silent? Many in Nazi Ger-
many kept silent about the
“Jewish problem” since if was
a “political’’ matter.

Should we not utilize every
available channel, even a spe-
cialized body like the Student
Council. to help correct an in-
justice?

Yet even if one does not take
this view of the role of the
Council (we cannot all be wild-
eyed crusaders). cannot its ac-
tion be justified on the grounds
that the Tougaloo case does in-
volve ‘‘academic matters’? ¢

An accredited, private col-
lege, like Davidson, is being
threatened with Communist-
style liquidation because it de-
viates from Mississippi’s No-
Think, closed society.

Where the academic freedom
of one such institution is en-
dangered, can that of another
be considered secure? Missis-
sippi, not the Council, seems to
be establishing a dangerous
“precedent.”

This kind of governmental
harassment could all too eas-
ily snowball. What if North

Carolina decided (where

“Communism is concerned
‘anything is possible) to ex-
tend its gag-law to private tn-
stitutions such as Davidson,
thereby curtailing our aca-
demic freedom? Would THE

DAVIDSONIAN then caution
the Council fo keep silent
about a “political” matter
such as this? | think nof.

If the gag-law is mainly a
product of North Carolina‘s ra-
cial struggle as Ed Yoder of
the Greensboro Daily News
stated in his chapel talk of April
13, could not further street dem-
onstrations or the like provoke
a broadened gag-law?

So maybe Tougaloo’s  situa-
tion and our own aren't quite so
remote after all. Perhaps the
political and the academic are
not so easily separted. And per-
chance freedom is, in fact, in-
divisible. Granted the above,
the Student Council had not only
the right but the duty to act.

Dear Editor,

Could the Davidson gufter-
snipes whose obscenities and
sub-human noises accompany
the films at the Union choose
one night a week for their
filthy fun, and leave the oth-
ers to those who wish to en-
joy the films? Or perhaps
they could find a pleasant
sewer in which fo congregate
and amuse themselves.

Perry
Dear Editor,

I am fed up to my eye teeth
with the comments coming from
the youth of today on the sub-
ject of sex and pre marital re-
lationships, and I feel constrain-

ed to reply—to the best of my
ability.

§ write as a parent of four
children (one a Davidson
“Gentteman’’), and tho (sic)
' hope they agree with my
ideas, 1 am parent enough to
make no claims.

Recent surveys of our stal-
wart college youth indicate a
straying from the ‘‘old-fashion-
ed’; precepts of morality. They
expound the theories of free
love and trial marriages, and
with typical New England de-
mocracy have even demanded
equal dormitory time with the
opposite sex.

in the minds of our youth,
the progress of the ‘60s in sci-
ence and technology demands
as earth-shattering changes in
morality. These enlightened
minds seem determined to
change one of the few remain-
ing stable facets of our so-
clety. (sic)

Science has altered our con-*
cepts of the creation of the Uni-
verse, the make-up of matter,
the theories of time and space.
but science has not yet, to my
knowledge, abrogated the fund-
amentals of the Bible.

IT am sure the college student
of today would be surprised to
find that our “older” generation
knew about sex at an early age,
and I do not even suggest that
we were lily white, but I do
decry the shielding of these
urges of youth with the mantle
of social acceptance.

Of Mandy And Beatles
.. And Davidson Men

BY ALLAN ARTHURS

What interests the average Davidson student about
Britain? The export of buses from Britain to Cuba? Civil
rights? The British educational system? Socialized medi-
cine? The British monarchy? Cricket?

No. The intelligent young
American college student is
more interested in talking about
Christine Keeler and the Bea-
tles.

At the beginning of the year
the “British sex and security
scandal" provided a variety of
questions:

Do you know Christine Keel-
er?

Have you been to bed with
her?

Do you prefer Christine or

Mandy?

After the first few times the
answers started to vary. Some-
times Christine Keeler was one
of my best friends, but on other
occasions she became too dis-
gusting to talk about. The only
‘way to combat the avalanche
of questions was to answer them
flippantly—sometimes I was be-
lieved.

After Christmas the Beatles
hit America with even more
force than Miss Keeler. At one
Stage questions were being
asked at the rate of twelve a
day.

Do you know the Beatles?

Are you a Beatie?

What d’you think about the
Beatles?

Have you seen the Beatles?

Are they a hit in England?

Some of the Davidson gentle-
men were trying too hard to
make conversation, but others
seemed genuinely interested in
the Beatles. Once again the an-
swers started to vary. If they
had not, they would have driv-
en me berserk.

With Beatle music blasting

across the fraternity court,
and the radio stations domi-
nated by it, my working hours
were plagued by Beatles,

For those who are really in-
terested in my opinion of Chris-
tine Keeler, Profumo, Mandy
and the Beatles, I will set forth
my views for the very last time.

Who slept with whom makes
interesting reading, but the
the Importance of this partic-
ular scandal lies in the ques-
tjons that it raises about, the
private lives of public figures.
if a man does his job properly
does It matter with whom he
sleeps? If it does then half
the British and American pol-
iticians may soon lose their
careers,

Two other points are worthy
of consideration. Was there any
security risk involved and did
Stephen Ward receive a fair
fair trial? These were the im-
portant and interesting questions
that Davidson students never
raised. ;

The only interest in the Bea-
tles lies in their impact on the
adolescents of the world. This
psychological phenomenon is
worth investigating and dis-
cerning. Also the way in which
massive publicity can mold
the tastes of a nation Is fright-
ening, for the Beatles were @
big hit even before their rec-
ords started selling in Amer-
ica.

May I, on behalf of the for-
eign students at Davidson, make
a belated plea for a few more
intelligent questions about our
respective countries?

D. C. Sophisticates Find
Israel In Folk Music

BY BILL FERRIS

Sometimes there comes a moment of awareness that a love pierces our shell of
self. We forget our petty criticisms of life and are transformed by a love for some-
thing greater than ourselves. Friday evening three hundred Davidson students who
heard the Echoes of Israel experienced this feeling.

At 8:20 John Spratt greeted
the audience enthusiastically.
“You don’t know how glad I am
to see each and everyone of you
here tonight.”

Students snickered and wait-
ed for the first act. In a blurr
of motion and song the Israeli
group began their program of
Jewish folk songs mixed with
adaptations of American rock-
and-roll.

After the first act the atmo-
sphere was electric. Shouts rose
above the applause following
each act. The two Israeli girls
created a vacuum of silence in
the auditorium with their grace-
ful folk dances.

The performance ended with
the beautiful harvest tune of
Have Nagila as every student
clapped in time. After the final
stanza students rose to give the
group a three-minute standing
ovation. The panting perform-
ers bowed and ran off the stage.

The show was over, but for
many students the evening had
just begun. A special ‘‘coffee"
hour had been announced which

would be held “up the road.”

Beer and _ hamburgers
were passed to each sing-
er while the accordian play-
er unpacked his instrument. In
minutes the room rocked with
Jewish and American folk
songs.

The party broke up at 12:30
and a few students followed the
group back to the Guest House
for a three-hour bull session.

Eitan Lev relaxed in his chair
and said “You know, you are
one hell of an audience. We've
had three standing ovations out
of five shows this trip but never
anything like tonight. There is
so much difference between you
students and the audiences we
have in New York. There we
play for bums. Millionaire
bums! They have money. So
much money, but nothing up-
stairs. Understand?”

We nodded.

“it takes us twenty min-
utes to break them out of their
shells. Every one of them
wears a mask and they’re
afraid to laugh and show their

feelings. But you fellows were
different. You were with us
all the way.”

As the evening wore on Baruk
brewed cups of Turkish coffee
and our drooping eyes opened
wide with each swallow. Twist-
ing the tips of his handlebar
mustache, Baruk winced and
said “‘That is what we drink in
the kibbutz when we are on
guard duty. Nobody goes to
sleep when he has Turkish cof-
fee in his belly.”

One student asked Eitan about
religion in the kibbutzim.

“Religion? They don’t have
services, bul it’s there. You
just go among the people
there and you feel it. They
live it every day.’

And we felt this religion
among us. We rose to leave the
tired group of Israelis and be-
gan thanking them for the eve-
ning.

“lt was so wonderful,’’ one
student fold Eltan Lev.

“Just say shalom,” he re-
plied. “That says all.”
