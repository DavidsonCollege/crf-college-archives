OPINIONS.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1994

Ii seems profound thoughts hit
you at the oddest times. I took off
for Virginia on Friday for four
days of sleep, hanging out with old
friends, sports, outdoors, and mu-
sic. No big plans, no real schedule,
nothing to make me think too
hard—or think at all if I could help
it.

And then it happened, in some
bar in Charlottesville, VA. I was
talking to a guy named Ryan from
Portland, Oregon who left his punk-
type band to join an acoustic group

out of D.C. We were laughing -

about other things: our first con-
certs, high school band competi-
tions, rivalries, bats, roaches, and
our horrible inability to express
ourselves verbally.

It was a typical night at a bar
before some cool band goes up on
stage and takes you away with
songs that say exactly what you

always wanted to while you stand -

back and let yourself be absorbed
in it all. The moments where you
say “This is college” because it is
finally the way you pictured it back

When a tree falls in the forest, :
someone should be there to notice.

‘

in fifth grade. —

We were talking about stage
fright. I was giving him a complex
about being microphone shy to
explain why he’s a bass player. He
defended himself quickly.

“T spoke at my graduation. I’m
not microphone shy.”

There was no “Deep Thoughts
Fairy” to keep me from diving in,
no one to warn me that I was about
to think more then I had in the last
few days, no one to keep my fall
break carefree.

“What did you speak on?”

“Drop outs. .I started with the
age old question: a tree falls in a
forest and no one is around. Does
it make a sound?”

I stared back for a second,

remembering that question from
my freshmen year philosophy class.

that the tree did make a sound.
Sound is the action, the occur-
rence—not the observation of it.
Something happens, whether small
or massive, and it must have a
result, a sound. Nothing goes by
without any real sign; it may go by
without notice, but everything has
the opportunity for notice at least.

“What was your answer?”

“Oh, it makes a sound. That
goes without saying. The real ques-
tion is why wasn’t anyone listen-
ing?”

So, in the midst of some dark

bar, minutes before Ryan was go- °

ing to take the stage, I flew into a
mental maelstrom. His question
was exactly right. We hear and see
what we want; we deal with what
we feel like at the moment. We go
with the things that are most con-
venient for us, what is in our com-

fort zone, what is familiar and non-
threatening to us.

There is nothing’ wrong with
comfort. I, too, love the moments
where I know exactly how to act or
how to respond or what to do. I
love these times, but they keep me
in the present, they let me be who
I am for right now and nothing
more.

It is the moments when I hear
some great roar and respond that I
alwaysremember. I grow and learn
the most when I see a face that
holds some deep pain and I re-
spond rather then flee because it is

_far more massive than Iam. When
I stop to realize that this world is
not necessarily about what is most
convenient to me, what makes me
happiest, or how I can benefit the
most is when I do the greatest
good, for myself and others.

This world and all of its prob-
lems have a lot to do with trees
falling as we walk by and our deci-
sion to listen and hear the roar or to
turn away and hear nothing. °
Granted, we must choose what we
will hear; we cannot fight every

‘battle, come to the rescue in every

dark moment. We can, however,
choose to listen and respond to
those problems that we may have
the talents to assist, no matter how
slight an undercurrent they may
seem. .

Ryan had a great set while I .
sat on my stool, wondering about
all the falling trees I should have
noticed but didn’t. When I laughed
at the ridiculous nature of my
thoughts in the midst of this bar
where one of my favorite bands
was playing, I realized that run-
ning into these profound realiza-
tions and taking them for face value
is true learning—a moment where
you can still say, “This is college,”
even though it’s nothing like the
way you pictured it in fifth grade.

I had pondered it then and decided

Cheer like a six-year-old

I was six years old and sitting on
the bench in my Clorox fresh
Jr.Demons uniform when Joe
Wytiaz caught the winning touch-
down against Jr. Raiders, a team
that featured Eric Lanctot—a kid
who had quickly learned that his
3°9,”’ 68-pound frame (there was

speculated steroiduse)enabledhim —

to truck through smaller, immo-
bile, screaming kids like myself.

But the combination of
coach’s special Lanctot rules (“If
you see Eric:coming, run!”) and
Eric’s unfortunate bout with a bad
bowl of Spagettios allowed Joe
Wytiaz to catch Tommy
Cushman’s bomb (7 yards) and
run frantically into the endzone
only to be stopped by the opposing
goalpost. What I remember most
about that day was how we acted
like mature little six-year-olds
throughout the entire game, even
down to the end: we whined,
slapped high-fives, spit water at
each other, made insightful com-
ments like, “Hey Coach! Tommy
has his shirt on backwards!” (fol-
lowed by tumultuous six-year-old
laughter), but most of all we
cheered our team on.

The basic six-year-old type
cheer reaffirmed that a) our team
was going to win, and b) the other
team was going to lose. We usu-
ally used the infamous Gregorian
victory chant to knock the team
into mindless submission. It went:
WE’RE GONNA WIN! WE’RE
GONNA WIN! NYAH! NYAH!
NYAH! NYAH! NYAH! (The
tongue sticks out at this point.)

Never mind the fact that we
were usually hoping for the “We’ re
losing by 17 touchdowns—please
let us go home” rule, rain, lighten-
ing, or a small tsunami, we still
cheered on. And we liked it.

But eventually the great six-
year-old cheer becomes a sign of
immaturity at age 15. Taunting,
poking fun, cheering, and general
emotion have become quite im-
proper. We’re supposed to be
mature, And! think that this hyper-

maturity has seeped into our aca-
demically minded brains at
Davidson. Maturity is good, but as
with everything, in moderation.

I’m not saying that Davidson .

students aren’t spirited. We’re just
a bit reserved. At Florida State,
people slap hi-fives, whine, spit
beer at each other, make insightful
comments like, “Hey Coach!
Tommy has his shirt on back-
wards!” (followed by tumultuous
six-year-old laughter), and gesticu-
late wildly when the cheerleaders
pull the lint off their sweaters. At
Davidson, the cheerleaders have
their organized routines and pre-
packaged peppy cheers, and stu-
dents respond with a piercingly
silent golfclap. (Clap. Clap. Ooops,
Ididn’t mean toclap.) Ican picture
it now: ;

Cheerleaders: One, we are the
Wildcats. Two, a little bit louder.
Three, we stillcan’t hear you: Four,
MORE! MORE! MORE! Hello?
Is anyone breathing?

I temporarily broke out of the °

Davidson passive crowd noise syn-
drome earlier this yearata women’s
volleyball game when six guys and
myself tried to bang on the seats,
perform the seven man wave, and
scream “Olé Olé’” aftereach point,

_in a concerted effort to cheer the

volleyball team on. We looked
kind of stupid, but we had fun.
And the players and coaches ap-
preciated the gesture. And it’s this
uninhibited, maniacal cheering,
similar to the fanaticism we showed
at last years’ Southern Conference
Tournament, that all the Davidson
teams need and deserve.

Look, the cheerleaders work
hard, as do the athletes, so the least
we can do is cheer like the nutty,
frenzied, irrational, childish,
twisted, English/History majors we
all are. I leave you with a thought
from one of the cheerleaders:
“People cheer only when the good
plays happen. Maybe if people
cheered some more in general,
‘more good plays would happen.”
Maybe so. At least we could try.

Gull’s Nest: Bill Gullan

An accompanied summer:
Reflections and pontifications

The great Tennessee Williams
once wrote, “In memory every-
thing seems to happen to music.”

I can just imagine what kind
of music would accompany my
memories of the summer (perhaps
John Lee Hooker’s “One Bour-
bon, One Scotch,

pus or I read about Washington,
DiGr & ay

Yes, I was on the Davidson-
in-Washington program, but as our
professor emphasized, the time
outside of class was equally im-
portant. I worked for the Young

bars, at monuments, or just on
Georgetown street corners.

A good song to accompany
my memories might also be Buster
Poindexter’s irritating “Hot, Hot,
Hot,” as D.C. is very muggy. Our
townhouse’s air conditioning
worked by and large,

just as professors
advise us to let our
rough drafts sit

them, it seems far
safer and much
more fruitful to
reflect on the past

I read last week in the checkout
- line at Dover's that Mr. Simpson
recently gave birth to an alien
child, which should take his mind
off his legal troubles.

but sweating post-
shower .was a fre-
quent uncomfortable
occurrence.

Our little
townhouse in
Georgetown fit us
four very snugly and
boasted a killer loca-

after a suitable
length of time has passed.

I do not mean the next morn-
ing, as many of us, between ago-

nizing trips to the medicine cabi-

net, are so fond of doing, but that
now might be a good time to re-
member, say, the summer. I have
been doing so recently as I see my
summer roommates around cam-

America’s Foundation, which is
sort of an anti-political correctness
watchdog group. My principal role
was that of director of their 16th
annual summer conference.

Fun was had by all, yes, but
many of my most memorable ex-
periences occurred out and about
in our nation’s capital, be they in

tion, but also an ex-
cessive price tag. Although we
economized (my roommates by

_cooking their own food, andme by _

ordering extra value meals at
McDonald’s), we still could not do
everything we would have liked.
Going out was limited (by class,
