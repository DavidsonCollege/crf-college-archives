Glass And Marsh Represent Dav-
idson College At Greensboro
Conference

Harvey Glass and Sid Marsh repre-
sented Davidson College at the annual
meeting of North Carolina college lead-
ers in Young Men and Young Women’s
Christian Associations, held in Greens-
boro the past week-end.

The convention, designated as “A Stu-
dent Seminar on Religion and Life,”
was a guest of the North Carolina Col-
lege for Women and was presided over
by Bruce Curry, professor of Bible at
Union Theological Seminary, New York
city. Dr. Curry is a Davidson man,

Bruce Curry, widely known. as a col-
lege and university preacher and spe-
cial lecturer is described by “The Chris-
tian Century” as “probably the most suc-
cessful interpreter of the Bible appear-
ing in Student Conferences in this coun-
try.”

Dr. Curry led the delegates in a-dis-
which hinged mainly on the
theme: “Finding a religion adequate for
life’s new demands.” Facing vital prob-
lems that have been brought up by pres-
ent life, Curry, and students discussed
the questions, “Do we need religion? Is
it adequate? Is not humanism—intelli-
gent planning and mastering of the re-
sources at hand sufficient?”

cussion

To such questions Dr. Curry made no
dogmatic answers but suggested that
whether or not religion is necessary de-
pends upon two things: first, upon what
we mean by religion and second, upon
what level the student determines to
pitch his life.

Dr. Curry pointed out the distinction
between the ideals of “high living” and
“low living,’ and divided men in two
groups, responsible and irresponsible. The
tesponsible men are those who have
been aroused to a wholesome discontent
with all that is low and are thus on
the way to the discovery of the high
place religion has in the search for a
better life,

The apparent disintegration in our in-
stitutions, the family, school, church and
economic order must be met with a
building up of a spiritual frontier by
youth. “Youth can meet the situation,”
said Curry, “only with the aid of God.”

And thus Curry pointed out that re-
ligion was an indispensable resource in
youth’s quest for the good life. “Re-
ligion contains a great truth about men
and the universe and expresses a great
law of our being. Social idealism, after
certain immediate goals have been at-
tained, wil] be forced to face those ulti-
mate issues which are only adequately
dealt with by religion.”

This meting of leaders in “Y” work
in North Carolina colleges is held every
year. Walter Sprunt, president of the
Davidson Y.M.C.A., is treasurer of the
organization for the year.

Student Pledges
To Be Collected

A recent report of the progress made
in collections for the Christmas gift
fund, reveals that two hundred and
seventy dollars is the total amount of the
fulfilled pledges, made by the student
body, thus far in the campaign. A com-
plete check-up has not been made as yet
with the various canvassers, but this is
the actual amount already in the hands
of the committee in charge.

Approximately two hundred dollars has
already been sent to Rev. R. H. Stone,
to be used in his work among the moun-
tain missions in the northwestern section
of North Carolina. Dr. Stone paid a
personal visit to the Davidson campus
recently and brought reports of the
great progress and increased enthusiasm
made possible by our gifts. The Y.M.C.A.
is delighted with its choice of a recipient
for their annual gift fund, and will
launch soon .a renewed campaign for
further collection of pledges made earlier
this year.

During the next two weeks, a can-
vasser will visit each man who has made
a pledge. These pledges, of course, are
not compulsory or binding in any way,
and if certain unforeseen circumstances
have arisen since the making of the
pledge that make it impossible to be met,
the student will be promptly released
from his agreement. However, if such
circumstances have not arisen, the “Y”

K. O., Gallant Canine Friend
Of Hundreds

Great minds cultivated at Yale, Har-
vard, and Oxford were put together at
the last meeting of the Davidson Execu-
tive Committee, for the purpose of-ex-
pelling the renowned Great Dane, K, O.
from, Davidson College. K. O. is a large,
light-brown dog, which many students
have mistaken for an undersized pony.
He wanders about the campus in the

named “Shadow.”

Gus Maynard, the grief-stricken own-

er of K. O., recently received a notice
to the effect that his dog had been -ex-
pelled. He made the fact known to
many of the faithful admirers of K. O.
and it is believed they shed many bitter
tears over his sad fate within the pri-
vacy of their darkened rooms.
K. O. has been known and loved by
all of the Davidson students for this
past semester. He was always cordial
upon meeting on the campus and he never
failed to bark a cheery “hello.”

When® interviewed upon the matter,
Gus Maynard made the following state-
ment: “I was very much depressed about
getting the notice and have high hopes
of swinging the faculty to my point
of view.” It was here that he revealed
the fact that he plans to make an ap-
peal for his beloved dog at the next
meeting of the Executive Committee. He
stated that he could not find the heart
to tell K. O. of his cruel fate and was
putting it off until the last minute.

Gus also said that if K. O. were ship-
ped, he must go to Bluefield, West Vir-
ginia, where the climate disagrees with
him very much during the winter.
“Shadow,” K. O.’s bosom pal, has not
as yet been informed of the news. How-
ever, she will probably read about it in
The Davidsonian.

K. O. makes his headquarters at
Thompson's Boarding’ House, where he
will be each afternoon to receive calls
from those who wish to bid him “good-
bye.”

wishes to make a personal appeal to each
man to pay his pledge as soon as possible
or when the canvasser calls at his room,
and thus have his share in this work.

Long Distance Conversation Be-
comes Popular As Callers
Wait In Line

Hello, Jacksonville—Davidson call-
ing! Hold the line—New York—David-
son calling! Are you there Omaha?—
Davidson, N. C., calling! This is Dav-
idson, N. C., calling Jan Garber at the
Trianon in Chicago! Clear the wires!
Davidson calling!

At about the above rate, telephone
calls went out of Davidson to all points:
Philadelphia; Mitchell Field, L. I.; Ala-
bama; Schenectady, N. Y.; Georgia; Ne-
braska; Stanton, Va.; and Louisville, be-
ing most conspicuous. Three calls were
completed to Chicago (so reports go),
and at least two to New York city, while
all points within the state received a
bombardment of Davidson-dirécted calls.

This sudden outbreak was due to two
new pay telephone booths installed in
East and West last week-end, They
were little used until some venturesome
soul found that the nickel he inserted
in the slot kept on going, finally coming
to rest in the “Money Refunded” cup.

When the fact was finally discovered,
the popularity of these phones spread
like wildfire. From 3:00 P. M. until
supper there was a waiting line clustered
around the booth in West. After supper
the phone in East was found to possess
the same peculiarity and it was imted-
iately crowded.

One call to Chicago was a request of
“O, Davidson!” from Jan Garber. An-
other Chicagoan, who insisted on heing
allowed to share expenses when the
conversation ran several minutes over-
time, was silenced by the hysterical pro-
tests of a student only too glad to pay.

By 10:30 the hallway of West was
jammed up to the first landing on the
steps with students waiting to make calls,
when suddenly a repairman arrived on
the scene. Forced to elbow his way
through the throng, he found it nearly
impossible to reach the booth. Finally
gaining the entrance, and unperturbed at
finding an empty money box, he fixed
the instrument, and the long distance
calls from Davidson settled back down
to the normal average of about two per
month.

ference.

The Saturday program consists of the
following: Reports from International
Relations Clubs, at 9:30 A.M.; Business

A.M,

Through last week, 30 delegates and
4 faculty advisors had definitely
signed up as representatives,

Places for the majority of the dele-
gates have been found in private homes
around the campus, Lamont Brown, who
is in charge of placing all delegates,
states, Warner DuBose is in charge of
Registration, and Mims Rogers is head
of the Entertainment Committee.

“Yes. After all, most popular music
is taken from Beethoven, Bach, and
Liszt.”

Then, just as I was terminating the in-
terview, I felt a touch on my arm, and
turned. At the stage door was an im-
patient gentleman in full evening dress.
The manager turned to me with a frown,
and whispered:

“Please, the president of the college
is waiting.”

Young Minister
(Continued from Page 3)

Christ Jesus was taken out into the court-
yard. John entered the court; Peter lag-
ged behind and John had to return for
him. A damsel at the door recognized
Peter and said to him, “And art thou not
also one of this Man’s disciples?” Im-
petuous Peter answered: I know Him
not.”

Impetuous ‘Peter continued his vehe-
ment denial ‘until he looked up, drawn
by some magic power and there stood
Jesus. Shame, remorse, and pain cut
Peter.

Who
among us has not done at least once,
what Simon Peter did?

Yes, we follow Him afar off and say
we know Him not that is why we all
feel such sympathy for Peter because
he represents us all,

Are we not all named Peter?

Every man hears the crowing of the
cock, said the speaker in his Vesper talk.
Not until the denials cease will the cock
be silent, said Rev. Peter Marshall in
terminating his talk.

Professor Pfohl and his symphony or-
chestra offered several selections for the
Y. M. C. A. Vesper Services.

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of
Davidson College, introduced Rev. Mar-.
shall at the morning worship. Dr. Lingle
called attention to the Belmont Plan, re-
cently endorsed by the Davidson Presby-
terian Congregation in order to secure
funds to carry out certain Church func-
tions.

Rev. Peter Marshall, pastor of the
Westminster Presbyterian Church of At-
lanta, Georgia, emigrated from Scotland
about ten years ago, after having gradu-
ated from the University of Glasgo-v.

He expresses his excellent ideas in 9
pleasing and delightful manner. Dr.
Marshall, an inspiring young minister, is
exceedingly popular among the young
people.
