|has been increased by these changes to 36.
i These improvements would have. been
made at the beginning of college, had
the weather not been so dry..

Dr. Arbuckle expects an unusual
amount of interest to be taken in the fall
tournament. Besides the advantage of
being able to play on the improved
course, every contestant will play with
the knowledge that he has as much
chance as ane to win. A handicap will
be given to everyone, so that the result
will not depend so largely upon how
much skill a player has, but upon how
he uses that ‘talent which he possesses.

The men on the Davidson golf team
will be picked by the results of this
tournament. Any freshman
ability will probably be placed on the
team, for, although a freshman may not
play in aon y Southern Conference
matches, there will be many contests with
neighboring clubs. :

The management will be selected at the
same time as the team.

When you
have to
concentrate
on a
heavy theme

TAKE this tip from Prince Albert: Pack your
pipe with P. A. and make fire with a match!
That’s the formula. Nothing complicated. And
it works, it works! Yes, sir! Every jimmy-pipe
bowl is a well of inspiration when it’s packed
with cool, fragrant, soothing Prince Albert.

You'll cerebrate . . . and celebrate the dis-

Albert is sure the right kind of

pal to tie to. No matter how stiff the grade,
P. A. will go right along with you. Can’t bite

parch your throat, because the

Prince Albert process won’t let it.

| Let Prince Albert cheer you with your work.
Let it sweep away the mental cobwebs as noth-
ing else can. In all the world of fine tobaccos,
there’s nothing like friendly P. A. Slip into top-
| speed now and head for the nearest store where
they hand out jimmy-pipe joy in tidy red tins,
marked ‘Prince Albert.”

| PRINGE ALBERT 4

—no other tobacco is like it!

P.A. is sold ev

here in
ound and half-
umidors, and

tidy red tins,
pound tin

pound crystal-glass humidors
with sponge-moistener top.
And always with every bit of
bite and parch removed by the
Prince Albert process.

R. H. McMillan, ’24, is one of the own- in the spring.
