Trustees decide
tenure, promotions

By ANN CuLp
News Editor

At the Trustee meeting on Fri-
day, four faculty members received
promotions, two were tenured, and
two were denied tenure.

Ann Marie Costa and Jennifer
Stasack (Music) were given tenure

as associate professors. Trent Foley +

(Religion), David Martin (Econom-
ics), Richard Neidinger (Mathemat-
ics), and Luis Pena (Spanish) were
promoted from tenured associate
professors to professors.

The Faculty Handbook states
that “the criteria for faculty evalua-
tion at Davidson are: (1) excellence
in teaching, (2) demonstration of
superior professional attainments in
research, scholarship, and curricu-
lum design, and (3) exemplifica-
tion of the intellectual and moral
values for which the College
stands.”

Any tenure decision “must be
based on convincing evidence that
the candidate holds promise of mak-
ing a continuing contributuion of
the highest quality to the intellec-
tual and moral life of the ee

community.”’ petunbrorrad

A professor is hired either as a
visiting or tenure track professor.
On the tenure track, a professor is
evaluated after two years by the
Vice President of Academic Af-
fairs. The President makes the de-
cision to renew the professor’s con-
tract or not.

After four more years, the pro-
fessor normally enters the tenure
review process. A Department
Evaluation File containing letters
and teaching observation reports is
created for the departmental tenure
committee. The committee votes
on the tenure candidate and makes
a recommendation to the Faculty
Tenure Committee (FTC).

After creating a Faculty Ten-
ure Committee File on the candi-
date, that committee makes a rec-
ommendation on each tenure case
to the President.

The Vice President of Aca-
demic Affairs, serving as an ex offi-
cio member of FTC; makes a
seperate recommendation to the
President. Finally, the Academic
and Education Policy Committee
of the Board of Trustees takes the
President’s report and makes a final
decision atits meeting in the spring.

Presidential speculation
abounds as semester closes

By MatrHew Erricu -
Associate Editor

Chair of the Presidential Search
Committee Larry Dagenhart nei-
ther confirmed nor denied that Rob-
ert Vagt ‘69 has been slated as the
next president of the College.

“TItremains to be seen,” he says.

Dagenhart says that Vagt has
not been offered the job, and that
the Trustees are “two to four weeks
away from a decision.”

Friday’s The Charlotte Ob-
server, citing unnamed official
sources, reported that Vagt is “the
leading candidate” to be the 16th
president.

Dagenhart did confirm that
Vagt has been considered. At the
beginning of its search, his commit-
tee solicited the names of possible
candidates. Vagt’s was one of ap-
proximately 150 names received.

It has been rumored that Vagt
has been chosen, and the announce-
ment delayed because of business
deals Vagt is arranging which would
be negatively impacted by an an-
nouncement at this time.

Inresponse to this speculation,

Dagenhart says, ‘There are numer-
ous reasons for our not being able to
proceed at this moment.”

There has also been specula-
tion that the announcement of the
next president will be made when
President Kuykendall gives his fare-
well address to the College andcom-
munity in May. But Dagenhart says
that the announcement is an event
the Trustees “want to stand on its
own.”

Vagt has not been employed in
academic work since graduation.

Vagt graduated with a B.A. in
psychology and earned an M.Div
from Duke University in 1972. As
a student, Vagt was a member of
PiKA, the swimming team, the Psy-
chology club, ROTC, the Social
Council, andthe Wildcat Handbook.
He was also a hall counselor.

Vagt has been involved heavily
in Davidson affairs since gradua-
tion. He served as the chairman of
the 1993-94 Annual Class Fund

‘System, and from 1993-95 he was

the chairman of Annual Fund Lead-
ership Council.

In 1996 he was awarded the
Alumni Service Award..

Sexuality Forum came out late

By MATTHEW Erricu

Associate Editor

Facing a bleak and uncertain
future less than a month ago, FLAG
rallied to hold its 4th Annual Sexu-
ality Forum sunday night in the 900
Room.

Seniors Zac Lacy and Adriana
Arciaand Lyman Collins ’79 spoke.
Lacy and Arcia had come out at
previous forums. The Sexuality
Forum did not exist when Collins
was a student or when he was a staff
member here until 1982. He has
been openly gay since 1982.

This was the first year in the
history of the event that no student
“came out.” The forum was not
held on its original date because no
one student was willing to “come
out.”

Lyman reflected that since he
was a closeted student here in the

late 70’s the environment for ho- |

mosexuals on campus has improved
drastically. “When I was here,

Davidson was a very different place.
That there is an organization like
FLAG says a lot,” he said.

Lacy concurred. “The general
spirit has changed. The campus is
more accepting of gay and lesbian
issues,” he said.

Arcia and Lacy said they had
not experienced many overt acts of
homophobia, but they did not doubt
that they had been discriminated
againstin more subtle ways. Lacy’s
one experience with overt homopho-
biacame when he caught two fresh-
men tearing down a flyer for a pre-
vious year’s Sexuality Forum.

Bothseniors wished fora larger
gay population on campus. Arciais
the only open lesbian on campus.
“Sometimes you just want some-
one who knows what it’s like,” she
says.

Dating also proves problem-
atic with so small a homosexual
population. Finding a partner dur-
ing his time at Davidson is “not

He has given up looking.

The panel expressed concern
that this year’s forum was not held
on its original date.

All three believe the forum
serves an important and unique pur-
pose, and should continue.

“Hopefully my presence as a
person who is out can help other
people,” Arcia said.

Lacy noted a trend toward the -
glamorization of homosexuality on
other campuses, and wondered what
would happen if that phenomenon
reached Davidson.

“I know at so many colleges
now that it is totally en vogue to be
queer. Can you imagine that here?”

‘he asked. The audience broke into
laughter.

Citing statistics that two to ten
percent of the population at large is
homosexual, Arcia asked, “Where
are you?”

Irene Middleton and Emmie
Happoldt were announced as

feasible at this point,” Lacy said. _FLAG’s next co-presidents.
