A Plan Of Action

Although in the past you

ed the fraternity issue with
and objectivity, the time has come when .we can no

longer keep our silence.
As most of the campus knows by now, THE DA-
VIDSONIAN’s normally reliable sources have leak-

ed to us that President Spencer may be on the way
out for his role in the recent social changes.

For once we are truly eC apbeane and we hope,

although it does not seem possib

be in error just this once. Bates
THE DAVIDSONIAN ‘has long maintained that

the trustee decision, where the
policy of this paper, are to be vwolanely resisted. After

r editors have approach-.

the utmost of restraint

e, that our story may

violate the editorial

all, they are not final no matter who says they are.

Sa we come to the case of President Spencer. If
the trustee decisions, where they violate the editorial
the- fraternities and decided to oust Spencer, then
it is high time we let them know how the majority
of students represented by this pafer feel about this
matter. --—-?

Yet-now that we have outlined our position, what
is to be done. The answer, of course, is obvious, and
that is just the sort of thing we have always advocat-
ed in this sort of situation. If that is done, a reason-
able solution to this problem is still within sight.

It must be clear by now

to the trustees reading

this editorial that we mean business. Your editors
realize that to be as specific and direct as we must
be in this situation may not endear us to our readers,
but sometimcs extreme situations demand such ex-

treme solutions.

A Valuable Vestige

All too often it seems today that college students
just do not appreciate all that they have been given
by their parents and by American technology.

Unfortunately the result of this failure to appre-
‘ciate the blessings of America results in the hasty
and senseless destruction of established institutions
which should be preserved—if for no other reason,
preserved for tradition’s sake.

Fortunately for Davidson, the voices of reason
have stepped in to bolster a Davidson tradition that a
small minority of hippy ingrates was trying to abolish.

We are speaking of the school annual, the Quips
and Cranks. The yearbook, as everyone knows, is vital
to the continued enjoyment of lifé. at Davidson, and
there is no doubt in: our minds that 99 per cent of
the decent students_here want it preserved so that
they can have a record of their stay at Davidson.

For that reason we welcome the news that a
special grant of $5,000 will allow the annual to con-
tinue in operatioi. To .do less would be less than jus-

tice.

Editorial Action

If the recently announced plans of Social Chair-
man Stuart Shelton are any indication, this year’s

Midwinters weekend should be the best ever for Da-

vidson college.

The qhenge he has planned with Union Director

C. Shaw Sm

and Union Board Chairman Weldon
Shenck are sensible, well conceived, supremely justi- —

fied, and certain to’ be welcomed by the student body.

Of course, we hardly need mention that these are
the same sorts of changes your editors have been ad-
vocating for almost a year now. —

SGA Longhairs Under Fire

The recent informal lunch-
eon talk delivered to the In-
dependent Round Table by
SGA President _G. Rankin
‘‘Nohble” Coble advocating
the abolition of His organi-
zation has raised both serious
fears and great hopes among
conscientious observers here.

One immediate result has
been an underground move-
ment, supposedly incited by
administration newcomer P.

Hairston ‘‘Harry” Hobbie
and called the “Hobble
Coble’’ movement. Another

of the rumored supporters is
the SGA vice president,” a
political and actual unknown.

“Pristine. persons of great
gallantry and  gumption,’’
according to Round Table
sources who hedrd Coble ex-
pound, ‘‘are needed to _recti-
fy the egregious government

ven

ANDERSON

of former years, and here at |

Davidson the studentry has

proved impuissant to provide |

such  palladinic
ties.” :

Coble also expressed his
concern about the SGA's role
in the undermining of stu-

personali-

. dent morality, according to

the Round Tablers. Coble
pointed out that the growth
of long hair on the Davidson

- Campus coincides with the

replacement of,.the former
student government by the
SGA three years ago.
Coble added that he want-
ed to make one thing per-
fectly clear: ‘‘Despite the
inadequacy - instigated in-
competence of the SGA, the
rewarding reporting and
selfless support of THE DA-

_ VIDSONIAN have been a

source of retrograde, rejoic-
ing to me in more halcyon
happenstances.”

Among the great hopes
felt_ by. responsible observers
here were the return to

closed dormitories, re-insti-
tution of Christian _ temper-
ance on campus and a
doubled football budget.

It was not believed that
even under the best of cir
cumstances abolition of the

Knough Of Crap

Enough of the crap. After
years of neglect by the pow-
ers that be, the silent ma-
jority of Davidson students
is organizing to put an end
to the gross incumbrances
under which it labors.

We are organizing because
the Davidson Establishment
does not realize that our
problems have nothing to do
withe the objects of the cur-
rent educational and social
reforms.

That is, most of the stu-
dents here are unhappy be-
cause: (1) if freshmen, they
haven't had a date for near-
ly a whole academic year;
(2) if sophomores, they
haven't had a good date for
nearly two academic years;
(3) some of the courses in
the present curriculum are
demanding to the point of
being rigorous; (4) it is im-
possible to avoid all of the
courses mentioned above;
(5) the money has run out;
(6) general depression; (7)
etc.

If many among the read-
ers of THE DAVIDSONIAN
find themselves nodding un-
derstandingly at the list of
troubles mentioned above,
here’s a hot flash: You don't
have to take it any more.

A group of concerned stu-
dent activists has formed an
organization which will meet

the needs of the Real Ma- .

jority of the Davidson stu-
dent body. This organiza-
tion is to be known as the
Blué Student Coalition; its
goal is the alleviation of the
miseries of Davidson stu-
dents through the. newly-de-

‘veloped concept of Creative.

Carping.

This” ingenious method of
‘problem solving is based’ on

* Will Terry 00) use

the older, more established
concept of ‘‘getting it off the
chest."’ ‘Broken down into
small discussion groups,
Blue Students will become
members of encounter
groups of no more than ten.

(At the opening of a ses-

— fie

SMITH

sion, one will reveal one of
his problems. Starting with
the phrase ‘‘You think that’s
bad..." a second student
will add a worry of his own.

This process will continue,
each student contributing in
turn, until the pool of com-
plaints are exhausted or un-
til a problem which eclipses
all others mentioned or con-
templated is produced. :

Such an innovation in stu-
dent affairs is worthy of
both praise and support by

-everyone in the college com-

munity. 3

The coordinators of the
Blue Student organization,
Cecil Burney and Rev. Scott
Woodmansee, have done an
outstanding job in ‘soliciting
funds, having conjured up
$45,000 in grants from the
Richardson and Union Acti-
vities Grant Foundations.

This will enable the BSC
to renovate” the Davidson
Presbyterian Church as a
headquarters for. the move-

~ment (this move being fa-
~-eilitated

the: ‘zocession of
a} labor).
