Student Senate Proposes
Constitutional Convention

By DANNY WHITE
Staff Writer

The SGA Senate~ formally
abolished all freshman regu-
lations and the freshman
court and proposed a Consti-
tutional Convention to modify
the conflicts between, the
existing Constitution and the
proposed Code of Responsibi-
lity in major business at its

weekly meeting Tuesday.
The motion to strike sec-
tions 3 and 4 of Article 8
dealing with freshman regu-
lations from the by-laws was
unanimously proposed last
week. However, the Constitu-
tion’ requires a waiting per-

IFC Alters
Rush Rules

Representatives of the In-
terfraternity Council voted
Tuesday night to limit the
ratio of freshmen to frater-
‘nity men at social gatherings
to three freshmen to five
fraternity men.

The previous ratio had
been four freshmen to eight
fraternity men.

The three-five ratio will be
in effect at fraternity parties
in other schools, also. Any
number in excess of this ra-
tio will be considered a rush
violation.

The rule allowing no more
than four freshmen in a fra-
ternity house at one time will
also be enforced.

jod of one meeting. before
action may be taken on a
Constitutional amendment
once it is introduced.

The motion carried by a
vote of 9-3 with the only op-
position coming from sopho-
mores Ed Dobbs and Gary
Cash and senior John Pass-
more. Cash pointed out that
a petition of the freshmen
showed that 25 percent of
that class favored the present
system of regulations. How-
ever, co-freshman advisor
John Gilmour said that only
three of the 17 members of
the Freshman Council favor-
ed the regulations.

SGA President Joe Murphy
asked that the Senate call a
Constitutional Convention in
order to modify the areas of
conflict’ between the Consti-
tution and the code. The SGA
must now approve the calling
of the convention in an elec-
tion Monday and Tuesday.

At the same time the SGA
will elect 29 members to at-
tend the convention—eight
from each of the upper class-
es and five from the fresh-
man class. The Senate select-
ed 7 members to attend the
convention: Franklin Ander-
son, Jim Cooley. Fletcher
Hartsell, Peter Hobbie, C. L.
Cheshire, Harrison Higgins
and Covey Carter.

In- calling the convention
Murphy pointed out that the
present Constitution must be
amended to include the
changes of the code. This
must be done before the SGA

- dence halls,

can vote on the code itself,
possibly next Thursday, the
day before the trustees meet.

In other business, the Sen-
ate voted unanimously to en-
dorse the faculty-administra-
tion proposal concerning the
implementation of the drink
ing rule in the code. The fac-
ulty-administration proposal
was almost identical to the
proposal of the Senate sub.
mitted last week—that drink-
ing be allowed in the resi-
in fraternity
houses and at the Union at
specified times.

The Senate also approved
the request of the Honor
Court to appoint Bayard
Miller,” Frank Spence and
Johnny Baker to the Investi-
gation Committee. Miller will
serve as chairman of the
committee.

There are 152 Negro fami-
Hes living within the limits

of the town of Davidson.

It would be difficult to
characterize them as typical
residents of a small college
town anywhere in America.
They are distinctly a part of
the South and a part of Da-
vidson, as much a part of
what is called Davidson as
the college itself. perhaps
more so.

Their community is separ
ate and distinct from the
community of students, pro-
fessors and prosperous towns.
people. It has. been shaped by
the coalescence of their in-
dividual racia’ history with
the economic. social and poli-
tical forces at work around
them.

Most of them have lived
here all their lives. They are
largely a static population.
a hereditary community ac-
customed to maintaining it-
self here.

They .are the residents of
The Other Davidson.

Negroes are not the only
residents of The Other Da
vidson, but they are in the
majority. Perhaps 20 white
families also live in the area
west of Main Street that
might be defined as The
Other Davidson. but they do
not share the same feeling of
community and group history
that the Negro community
shares.

The Negro community is
distinguished from the col-
lege community by its lack of
economic power, its tack of
education and training, and
its lack of political power.
For all practical purposes it
has always been this way. ~

But conditions have begun
to change.

The economic position of
the Negro community has
changed as the result of a
relatively recent influx of
industry to the Davidson
area. .

Members of the community
are now employed by H. K.
Porter Co.. General Time
Corp., Carolox Co,, Reeves
Bros. Inc. and Mooresville

Mills as well as the college.

One resident of The Other
Davidson assessed the mean-
ing of the economic growth:
“Used to be a man worked at
the college and brought home
$40 a week to his wife and
maybe had four or five kids.
Now he can work at one of
the mills or he gets paid
more by the college, and his
wife can work too. Together
they may make $125 a week.”

Five years ago the Mayor’s
Committee on Community Re-
lations was formed to inves-
tigate problems between
whites and blacks in David-
son. Today the practice of
segregation has been curtail-
ed in most of the businesses
in the town.

Last September a housing
project was begun which has
led to the construction of 20
new homes so far. But the

Negro community is still
crowded, and a housing short-
age still exists. Many of the
old houses have been con-
demned or will be condemn-
ed when they are vacated.

Among the members of the
Negro community, there is
the idea that conditions can
be different.

Some are getermined to
make them different.

Trustee Query

Thus Saith Faculty:

This is the text of the faculty statement on

drinking:

Davidson College as an institution expects

to operate in strict accordance with both the
spirit and letter of the laws of the State of North
Carolina with regard to the possession and con-
sumption of alcoholic beverages. Additional re-
striction on ‘possession and consumption are im-
posed by the College. .

The possession and consumption on campus
of beer, ale, and wine (ABC Laws 18-64) by stu-
dents 18 and over, and of other alcoholic bever-
ages (ABC Law 1840) by students 21 and over,
shall be, permitted only within private homes,
fraternity houses, residence halls, designated
areas of the College Union, and any other area

of the campus which the College Administration
may designate for a specific occasion.

Students and non-students are expected to
abide by North Carolina laws and Davidson Col-

lege regulations.

constitution.”

“It's fine to have a con-
stitution. but when it starts
getting in the way..." Murphy
said. He added that he
thought ‘‘the constitution
needs guidelines, not fences.

Recent freshman water
raids necessitated the writ.
according to Cousar. “Fun’s
fun, but when you start ruin-
ing property,” he said,‘‘the
limit has been passed."' He
referred to extensive dam-
age done to student’ property
on first and second floors of
Belk during a raid last Satur.
day night.

“The freshman can just
put their beanies back on if
they're going to act like
children,"’ Murphy said of the
disturbances on Saturday
night and Sept. 25. “If they
(freshman) don’t accept re-
sponsibility, they're going to
be punished.”

Also included in the writ
of order was an instruction
to the Senate Executive Com-
mittee to appoint ‘another

peals to fill a vacancy creat.

ial problems within the com
munity, including but not
limited to open housing, fair
employment, and public ac-
comodations,”” the ordinance
says,

The ordinance does not give
the Committee on Commun-
ity Relations any specific
powers to deal with the prob.
Jems of the community ex-
cept to hear grievences.

The work of the committee
was brought into the spot
light last spring ‘in connect-
ion- with the student boy-
cott of Johnson's Barbershop.
The Committee may recom-
mend to the Town Council
“legislation or other actions
to eliminate or reduce dis-
crimation with respect to
race, color, religion or nat-
ional origin.”

A Mayor's Committee on
Community Relations was
appointed as an informal ad-
visory group without legal
status by Mayor F. L. Jack-
son five years ago.

Dr. Daniel D. Rhodes,
chairman of the mayor's
committee. said ‘What we
wanted was official recog-
nition and endorsement by
the Town Council, represent-
ing the people of Davidson.of
our efforts toward the elim-
ination of discrimination in
this community.”

“This ordinance gives the
Community Relations Com-
mittee new prestige and of-
ficial sanction to expand
what it has been doing un-
officially to improve com-
munity relations,"" Rhodes
said. “Of course the com-
mittee now has legal recourse
to the authority of the Town
Council and to the courts if
necessary.””

Rhodes expressed confid-
ence that legal measures
would not be needed except
to lend the committee great- ‘
er bargaining power.

The committee consists of
15 members. at present there
are two faculty members and
five Negroes. Jesse Sims and
Mike Maloy are the student
representatives. with Robert
Pyeatt as alternate.

Mike Norris, one of the
leaders of the barbershop
boycott, expressed disap
pointment that the ordinance
does not include specific pro.
hibitions of discriminatory
practices. ‘It doesn't slate

that discrimination is illegal:
indeed it is only implied.

“The town apparently has
taken’ no new stand on dis
crimination other than to
make attempts at concilia-
tion.”

Sims, however: expressed
optimism that the ordinance
would greatly improve con-
ditions in the community.
“It looks as if everybody with
a gripe is going to be heard
now,” he said.

Spurs Statement

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

A statement outlining in.
itial drinking privileges un
der the proposed Code of
Responsibility was approved
by: the faculty Tuesday.

The statement, which also
represents the position of
the Administration and close-
ly resembles that adopted
by the SGA Senate last week,

would permit drinking ‘only -

within private homes. f[rat-
ernity houses, residence
halls, designated areas of
the College Union, and any
other area of the campus
which the college adminis-
tration may designate for a
specific occasion."

The, faculty's action came
in response to a request by
the trustees for an illustra-
tion of how the drinking sec
tion of the code might be im-
plemented,

The board, which has .al-
ready delayed on: the code
twice, is expected to render
a final verdict. at its meet.
ing here next weekend.

The statement represents
“the initial method which
would be used to allow drink
ing on campus only if the
trustees approve the code."
Dean of Faculty Frontis W.
Johnston said. Otherwise, he
said, the statement will be
“null and void.” ;

The statement was drawn
up by several groups. inc-

Curfew May Be Changed

Life Committee and the
faculty Committee on Frat-
ernities, Clubs.) and Social
Life. It was intially approved
of the college, the executive
committee of the faculty.
and SGA President Joe Mur-
phy before being presented
to the faculty.

Dean of Students Rich-
ard C. Burts Jr. emphasized
that the trustees will be faced
with the sole question of
whether to approve the code,
not of whether to approve the
statement also.

“Their job is to set the gen-
eral policy,’’ Burts said, ‘and
leave the specific details of
avhen and how to the admin.
istration, faculty and stud-
ents.

“If it turns out that this
is not the best plan.” he said.
“then we would not have to
wait six ‘months for a trust-
ees’ meeting to make a
change.”

The traditional policy of
the college has always ban-
hed being under the influence
of alcohol, drinking and pos-
sessing alcohot on the David-
son campus.

The campus is defined as
the town limits of Davidson
and the Lake Campus.

Students voted out their
own ban on drinking in 1965
by vote of 301-150, one
vote over the two thirds mar.
gin required.

Action, Please is designed to cut red tape
and end the run-around in administrative .chan-
nels, whether the channels are those of the col-
lege administration, student government, faculty
committees or the Town of Davidson.

“Why nots?”, injustices, questions and sug-
gestions are all welcome, and whether the answer
is printed or not, the queries will be followed up
by THE DAVIDSONIAN. The column will run
every other week.

Since we don’t have Saturday classes any
longer, why do we have the same curfew rules at
fraternity houses? The rule now requires girls to

‘be out of the houses by midnight all nights but

Saturday. Girls must leave the houses by 1:30
a.m. Saturday night (Sunday morning).
— Steve Page

“Because there’s not been any general re-
views of the specific regulations,” said Dean of
Students Richard C. Burts Jr.

However, he said the rule probably would
be revised “pending what ever review does come
from the Code of Responsibility.”

Exactly how many chapel cuts will we get
each term? And, now that we have the one-fourth
cut rule, if the college announces that we have
four cuts, and five speakers later cancel out, do
we then get only three cuts?

— Robert Pyeatt

Students will get four cuts the first term,
according to Chaplain Scott Woodmansee, who
said there are 18 scheduled assemblies the first
term.

Cancellation after the term begins do not
affect the announced number of cuts, he said.

ers and damage to campus or student property?

Do we have responsible students if they can’t
appoint a court and enforce their regulations?

— Richard C. Burts Jr.

The Court of Appeals Monday ordered the
Senate Executive Committee to nominate mem-
bers of the Student Government Court, which
handles these offenses, by Oct. 10, as a result of
Burts’ statement.

However, SGA President Joe Murphy plans
to ask for reconsideration of the writ, since he
says the Student Government Court would be

superceded by provisions of the Code of Respon-

sibility, which

Board of Trustees next Friday.

Why wasn’t the student store, and along with
it the pool tables, open last Saturday afternoon
and night? Both were open Saturday nights last
year.

— Dick Anderson

Peter Nicholls, director of the student store,
said Wednesday that lack of labor was the reason.
“The next one to ask, send him down to work.”

He said that the pool tables were open ffom
7:30 to 11 p.m. last Saturday, but that only four
or five students used them.

Nicholls attributed the absence of students
willing to work Saturday nights to the large num-
ber leaving for the weekend, now that Saturday
classes have ended.
