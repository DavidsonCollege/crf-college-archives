Tuesday night was
one of those nights that
Davidson's not-always-
-s0-eugey cagers simply
couldn’t be denied a
win. The way the boys
plaved—the spirit and
drive that they ex-
hibited — would lead
one to believe that it
was they who were
fighting for a berth in
the conference tourney,
not Clemson. As it was,
the win had littlé to do
with Davidson’s stand- &
ing, but it rudely shut
the tournament door in

COBB TERRIFIC DESPITE ILLNESS

In posting their highest first half total this vear —41 points

—Davidson put on an exhibition of some of the fanciest and
most deadly shooting seen in Johnston gym thus far, Henzeveld's
long, archless set-shots dropped through the nets for ten points:
Tom Haller pushed in 12 from his forward slot ; and Bill Brooks,
combining hard driving and push shots in the circle, rang up 4
total of 16 points. Yes, these men all did a lion’s share of the
work, but orchids must go to Captain Whit Cobb, for his sterling
all-round play. It would be almost trite to add anything else to
all that has been said all year long about his brilliant floor.
playing, so we'll only dwell on the point-making knack which
the Durham product had against Clemson.

In a furions four minutes at the beginning of the game
Whit had looped eight points through the nets which is by itself
close to his average‘for games this vear. This was indieation
enough that something was in the air, and Whit bore this out
by going on to post twenty points during the fray.

The facet that made Cobb's performance ‘all the more re.
markable was that a severe head cold had kept ‘him in its vrips
for nearly a week. In practice on Monday, Whit took only a
light part and it was questionable whether he would do much
playing Tuesday night at all. But he did, and im doing so sesved
the’ most points of his entire basketball career. After the game
we were talking with Whit and he said, ‘‘You know, this game
of basketball is truly perplexing’’ — obviously referring to
his scoring twenty points on one night when his past per-
formances this year had run hot and cold. We asked Whit when
was the last time he scored twenty points in a game, and he
replied, ‘‘G. P., that’s the first time I ever scored as many as
twenty points in an organized basketball game in my life. My
sophomore year, I managed 18 against Maryland, and again 18
against UNC last year, but tonight was the first time.that |
have ever broken twenty.”’

This fact is surprising, especially when one considers the fact
that Whit was named to All-State teams in High School and on
college All-state squads for the past two years. It is proof that
the lanky Student Body President has distinguished himself as
an all-round eager in the eyes of seribes all over the state, rather
than as a basketball player whose only forte is shot-making.
That Whit, should have risen to sneh heights Tuesday: night as
his athletie career is drawing to a close, is a source of real pleas
rave to all of us who have watched this modest, unassuming cotm-
petitor in action through the vears. There will always he basket-
ball at Davidson, but never another Whit Cobb.

FROSH RING DOWN OURTAIN

The preliminary game Tuesday night between Ray Brown's
Frosh charges and Clemson's frosh brought. to.a close the seasan
for the local lads. In looking back over the won-lost record,
they can point to but three wins, but they can point with pride
to the spirited competition which they gave in many games while
losing. In piloting his first eage squad, Ray Brown did well in
pulling the team together after a dismal start and produing
a eréw which more than held its own against all opponents in
the latter part of the season. This year’s frosh squad lacks boys
who can be immediately tabbed as sure-fire varsity material
next year, the biggest reason, of course, being that this year’s
varsity is made up largely of sophomores and there will. be few
openings on it next year. But don’t count these lads out, for
in a year or two such names as Bowen, Graham, Asbury, Howell,
King, Lippard, and Crosland—to mention a few—will be mak-
ing the press notices.

was his great work in the Clemson
game which makes him the Wild-
cat of the Week.

Against the Tigers Tuesday
night, as in all games, the David-
son captain showed why many call
him the conference’s best defen-
sive guard. His speed and defensive
ability are assets which allow him
to stick right on top of his man
and which also makes it impossi-
ble for an opponent to get a stop
on him, thus cutting fouls to a
minimum. It is needless to men-
tion the high scorers that Whit has
held down, but it might be noted
that Cobb was charged with one
foul Tuesday night and that’s about
average for him, but what an aver-
age. Many observers have wondered
how such a little (6 feet, 150 Ibs.)
man gets so many rebounds. Clem-:
son sadly learned that it was ‘his
springy legs and his ability to be
at the right place at ‘the right
time.

Although the records this year
show that Whit has fallen off in
his scoring, it certainly wasn’t
noticeable as he banged in 20 points
to be high man for the evening.
His 8 points in the first four min-
utes of the game were a bad sign
for the Tigers, who wefe really out
to win in order to make the Con-
ference Tournament. Whit’s set
shots, always a dangerous weapon,

made him look like the Whit Cobb

who never missed a set a couple of
years ago.

The leadership, playmaking and
fine ballhandling of Captain Whit
Cobb has made the difference’ be-
tween winning and losing in quite
a few games this year. An out-
standing example of this took place

the other night.

It's difficult to believe shat Whit
could ever hold a grudge; how-
ever, it seems so in. this case. In
Whit’s first year, Clemson knocked
the Wildcats out of the Conference
Tournament and ‘this time it was
the Tigers who needed to win for
a berth. Whit paid them back.

Kittens Lose In Overtime For Second High Point Matters

Consecutive Night;

By JIM FARRAR
Saturday night, the Wildkittens
made their last road trip of the
season down to Belmont Abbey to
battle the Crusaders. The Kittens,
‘fresh from a 72-70 overtime defeat
at. the hands of Wingate,- started
off slow in the game. The tight zone
defense of the -Crusaders had the
Red men_ baffled throughout the
entire first half. The long shots of
Asbury and the driving push shots
of Bowen were the only factors that
kept the Davidson five in the game. |
The score at the half was 25-19,

Belmont Abbey leading. -

However, the Davidson cagers
fought back against the Crusader’s
man-to-man defense and after the
first ten minutes of the secdnd
half, Davidson had tied the score
at 37-all. The game became very
rougi, each team trying to gain
the advantage. With a minute and
a half to play Davidson led by four
points, 45-41. Bendel came in for
Belmont Abbey and saved the game
for them by sinking two long shots.
The game ended with both teams |
having 45 points.. Belmont scored

-|three quick field goals and then

held off a rally by Davidson. Bowen
and Vance scored field goals for
the Kittens with Asbury tossing in
a free throw.

This was the second straight
game the freshman five have lost in
an overtime. Perhaps the failure of
the Kitten five was due to the in-
capacity of Graham to hit for five
points. The tight defense of the
Crusaders was responsible for the
ace frosh forward being held to
so few points. Bowen led the Wild-
kittens with 14 points, followed
closely by “Pee Wee” Asbury’s 12
markers.

Freshmen, ‘2I-Il

By DICK LILES

The freshman grapplers met High
Point earlier this week and dropped
a close match to them by 21-11. The
Kittens shortened the margin of
defeat from their earlier meeting
The Pointers were
handed five points because of Da-
vidson’s inability to produce a
heavyweight, which made the score
actually look worse than the match.
Here are the results by the separate
classes:

121 tb.—Craven (D) decisioned
Rogers (HP),

128 Ib—Irvin (D) pinned Willis

(HP)...

points came in the first four min-
utes of play, and five more came in
the waning minutes of the ball game
to clinch the victory.

The scoring started off fast, with
Brooks, Cobb and Hengeveld hii-
ting for Davidson, while Haugh,
Clemson forward, kept the Tigers
within distance with his overhead
shot. By halftime, Davidson had
piled up 41 points to Clemson's’ 34,
which is unusually high for a mid-
way mark. It was Davidson’s scrap
pitted against Clemson’s height thus
far. Clemson’s two centers, 6’. 5”
and 6° 6," were getting many of
the rebounds.

Clemson rallied in the first few
minutes. of the second half and
pulled ahead of the Cats for a short-
lived lead. Tigers Jim Reynolds and
Ronald Richardson had begun to
hit the nets, and the Cats were now
forced to come from behind. That
is exactly what they did as David-
son's Bill Brooks, Tommy Haller,
and Whit Cobb began to work bril-
liantly to pile up another Cat lead.
Once again Clemson forged ahead,
53-51, with only a few minutes re-
maining. It was here that Cobb’s
leadership came through as he
led Davidson ahead again to stay.
Wildcats Brady Osborne and Bob
Turk came through with goals late.
in the game to ice the contest for
the Cats.

Cobb’s 20 points were high for
the. night, and Bill Brooks and
Tommy Haller tossed in 16 and 12.
apiece for Davidson's cause. Dick
Haugh and Jim Reynolds led the
‘Clemson scoring with 16 and “4
points. From the foul line, the
Tigers hit 15 of 24 tries, while Da-
vidson was successful on 17 of 25.
This was perhaps the most brilliant
game of the year for the fighting
Cats, who proved they had come
a long way and were fast becoming
a team to be reckoned with in the
Southern Conference.
