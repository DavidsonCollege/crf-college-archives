We accept he challenge flung at us.

Tubby Woolfolk and Bevo Davis now hold
!a very unique college honor. ‘They are the
!only two in the history of the college that
| ever broke up church on Sunday morning.

“Charles Paddock” Galloway certainly
lought to have picked out wonderful track
material Sunday. Even Orbuthnot clipped
| off the distance in six flat.

Pat Crawford is awarded the wicker
' worked punch bowl and George Mauze the
fur-lined tea cup. The former sweetly
snoozed with flames licking his very cheeks,
| but was unmoved, and the latter whistled
Twelfth Street rag in the showers while the
old edifice rocked and reeled with flames.
To Frank Wildman goes the consolation—a
|rubber teething ring. He was reading in
| his room, the ceiling above and the hall out-
side looking like Pittsburgh on a real smoky
|day. “How I rescued One Punch Iogan
From the Burning Flames.”

Fresh Clater also reports that besides sav-
ing his eyeshade, he managed to save a
|cigarette duck left over from Saturday
| night.

Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah,

What’s all the excitement?

Blanco White lost his smoking jacket
Sunday.

A Georgian’s Testimony

Georgia certainly hates to have to look at
Rumple the rest of the year. We enjoyed
looking at Watts or at least we had become
accustomed to them. Why Rumple doesn't
!even know the first principles of dormitory
hollering when the lights go off suddenly,
like Watts did.

New Management

I am manager for the Mauze, Lindamood
| Wrecking Crew, Inc. We want additional
buildings desiring quick conquering. Noth-
ing considered but buildings in good work-
ing condition and capable of putting up a
| good fight. For references write the Singer
' Building, New York, whose base we rocked
for sixty seconds last week. R. L. McLeod,

A MERRY RY DRAMA
In Many Achar and Numberless
Scenes

|
| Introducing “The Freshman,” or to speak
|campus wise “Fresh,” a verdant member of
|’ 26, who constantly craves information. It}:
is our resolution that he shall be informed.
| Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
| prominent senior; he prides himself on the
|nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private
| opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer.
| “Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
| prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
|taste is more conservative and substantial;
jin regard to his love affairs the old adage,
| “Still water runs deep,” is applicable.

Mac—
| A curious man of the human clan
| Is a man who fools himself,
| Who thinks he can swing the Pierian spring
| Through a conduit of books on a shelf.
| Who thinks—
| Bill—Cut out the chin music just for once,
(will you?

Mac—Oh! you don’t know good stuff
| when you hear it. Say, where in the sam-
“hill is my shirt—I mean the clean one.
Bill—Another instance of a “curious man
| who fools himself.” You couldn’t make me
mad if you would buy a few more good ones.

Mac—In order to help you maintain a
peaceable state—

Bill—Good!, Mellon’s says whites, pon-
gees and tan and grey pongees in broad-
clothes, and Oxfords are high scorers. Better
pay them a visit.

Mac—Mellon’s is my meat.—( Adv.)

Davidson, N. C,

A young kid only fourteen years old won
the horseshoe tournament at Miami _ last
week, but we won't acknowledge his cham-
pionship until he beats George Hodgin and
Ed. Brown. :

Convicts 747 through 753 won their letters
and new uniforms last week and reported to
their respective dormitories for janitor
service. They look like a parade of the
Swiss Navy in full dress.

The movie magnates of Davidson have
evidently been attracted by the glamour of
the filthy lucre —-——— first it was “Nobody’s
Money,” then “Back Home and Broke,” and
the next cinema attraction is “When
Knighthood Was In Flower’ — probably
some “dough” in that!

Friend Walthadl don’t know whether to
have a girl up for Junior Speaking or go to
the Volunteer Conference. His peace parley
has gone on the rocks and he has recalled
his ambassadors when last interviewed.

A statement was made to the Fresh French
class the other day that the inscriptions re-
cently unearthed in King Tutankhamen’s
tomb are as nothing in comparison with the
hieroglyphics that he finds on some, of his
French papers.

Bible Prof.—Now, Mr. Justice, can you
tell me who was one of the first patriarchs?

Fresh Justice (scratching his head) —Why
—no—er—I—

Bible Prof.—Exactly right, Mr. Justice.

Ashes to ashes,
Sticks to sticks,
If you keep a girl now
You've gotta have a super-six.

The fad at chapel exercises these days |
seems to be club meetings.
ize a K. K. K. to rid the campus of its |
numerous dogs and dusty “blacks” roaming |
around loose.

Weedon wishes to announce through the

columns of the Peanut Parcher that his |

recent dressing up has nothing to do with his |
campaign for the handsomest man in the |
Junior Speaking group.

Have you noticed Houck and McLaurin

scaling the outside walls of Shearer Hall |
and West like a sky lark and back to earth | #3
like a mud hen? If the flag pole ever de- |}

yelops cobwebs and needs cleaning, page
these two Houdinis — they guarantee
satisfaction.

(We might encourage these two gallant
scaling bugs with the promise that we are
reserving sufficient obituary space for them
in these columns.)

A Mystery
Red McCombs can’t understand why they
gave 15 rahs for him at the picture show

Saturday night when every night when he’s i
home he goeS to corn shucking, barn dances, | }:

fiddlers’ conventions and spelling b’s with
girls and never gets an ovation.

If two and one is shoe polish and three
and one is oil, what’s four and one? It

usually is five, but if it is four unexcused Hi

Why not organ- |

jabsences and one excused, it’s the dickens
to pay.

Speedy Carr caps ‘the climax! He has
taken up fencing. Guess he is planning to be
prepared to fight the next fire or get a job
with Rhoda Royal Circul swallowing one
of the things.

Fresh Seago has volunteered assistance in
repairing all dilapidated typewriters. His
experience was gained after the disastrous
Watts conflagration — at the expense of
Speedy.

MYSTERY SURROUNDING
“D” PIN IS CLEARED

Is the world coming to an end, or is
Davidson going to get a swimming pool?
Are co-eds eligible for college athletics?
Are there any_lady members of the D Club,
or is there some other way in which members
of the weaker sex can get to wear the D
pin?

These were a few of the excited questions
that were asked some few weeks ago at the
Trough, when it was discovered that Miss
Eliza, the cook, was wearing a D pin.
Excitement ran high and many and startling
were he hypotheses suggested as to how she
came by the pin. When interviewed on the
subject, she maintained that she had played
center on the football team. Many people
upheld her in this argument, but others con-
tended that it was only her innate modesty
that forbade her revealing the member of the
D Club who had been vamped by her niad
airs and had presented her with the pin as
token of his devotion.

The. only members of the D Club who
work at the Trough are George Mauze, Pat
Crawford and Hugh Bradley. George was
considered and declared “Not guilty” be-
cause he came from West Virginia. Pat
was considered and declared innocent on
general principles. Hugh Bradley was like-
wise considered, but suspicion pointed her
accusing finger at him. It was testified that
he had been unwontedly absent-minded of
late. He had raved much of the mystic effect
of the moonlight, it was maintained, relating
rapturously how the magic moonlight was
able to cast a halo of beauty about anyone's
head. What has clinched the matter in the
minds of many, and given sufficient proof to
make the hypothesis a plausable theory, ‘is
the fact that, no sooner was Hugh Bradley
burned out of Watts than he immediately
picked up his tennis racket and moved to the
Trough.
