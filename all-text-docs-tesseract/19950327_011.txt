John Knecht’s

By GeorpiE SCHIMMEL
Staff writer

Last Wednesday at 8 p.m., Dr.
John Knecht of Colgate University
displayed his films in Perkins Au-
ditorium. Knecht is involved with
television theory, which he ex-
plains this way: “I tell my students
to watch TV with their noses to the
glass. That way they see the indi-
vidual pixels which make up the

‘image, and the illusion is gone.”
The illusion of reality, that is. But
there is a different reality to televi-
sion, says Knecht. That other real-
ity, partly the effect of the juxtapo-
sition of images, partly something
difficult to verbalize, seems to be

the inquiry of much of his work.
Forexample, Knecht is watch-
ing television in his studio in 1976.
Tom Brokaw’s on. Brokaw is nar-
rating footage of a Parisian village
lying in ruin, its inhabitants deci-
mated by chemical warfare. Then
the scene changes to an advertise-
ment — a row of gleaming toilets
sing of their success with some
type of scouring agent. Televi-
sion, according to Knecht, “ques-
tions how we assimilate informa-
tion and raises larger issues of per-
sonal identity.” The juxtaposition
of images on television prompted
him to examine film and the impli-

. cations, intellectual and metaphysi-

cal, of the random mixing of me-

dia.

How does he examine televi-
sion and its consequences? By
making his own films, naturally.
Knecht uses two Amiga comput-
ers — “sticks he can draw images
in the sand with.”

His use of Amigas is in itself
amazing, roughly analogous to
winning the Tour de France with a
unicycle. Yet he is quite adept
with his unicycle: he can overlay
image on image, working with
about 1/30th of a second at a time
because that way, as he describes,
“he has complete control.”

Essentially, Knecht’s work
deals with the collation and sub-
jectivity of things. Much of it is

quite surreal. For example, the
human figures in his films lack
faces. Small televisions on the
screen throb with color against a
monochrome background.

Individual, seemingly con-
tinuous action is on closer inspec-
tion a series of loops — one action
smoothly repeated again and again.
These and other techniques con-
vey his philosophy about televi-
sion.

In a piece entitled “The Pos-
sible Fog of Heaven,” the
discarnate voice of Elvis Presley
narrates a metaphysical specula-
tion into the nature of afterlife. In
another, “Impermanent Firma-
ment,”

films explore the illusions of television

Knecht bombards the viewer
with images which can not possi-
bly be assimilated all at once, very
much like television. The driving
idea behind his work, hefexplains,
is “re-contextualizing images, | re-
figuring them, juxtaposing one on
the other.”

For all his philosophical
speculation—he said in the middle
of his presentation, “T’ m in a meta-
physical mood tonight” — Knecht
ought not to be discounted as an
artist. His work, more video-poem
than film, bespeaks an obvious,
penetrating intelligence, a relent-
less wit, and especially an
inconcealable artistic flair. Elvis
might have phrased it better.

Arnold Mesches' new exhibit engages the issues that
perplex our country

By GEORGE WELD
Art Critic for The Davidsonian

In the middle of this century,
the American poet Wallace Stevens
wrote of a “life apart from politics”
that was the “radiant and produc-
tive atmosphere” of the poet.
Whenever Stevens wrote of po-

etry, he was writing of painting, asf

well; his statements on either me-
dium may be taken as statements
concerning art in general. His
stance toward the issue of politics
and art is typical of a modernist
attitude thathas prevailed in Ameri-
can art in spite of the persistent
objections of the politically and
socially concerned who find “pure
art” amoral and irresponsible.
Arnold Mesches, whose gaud-
ily beautiful paintings replaced the
“pure art” prints of Ansel Adams
in the V.A.C. this week, is an
American artist who belongs to a
different tradition than either
Stevens or Adams. Mesches’ artis
steeped in the political and the
social, engaged forcefully in the
issues that perplex our century.
The title of the series from which
this show is taken is “The Anomie
Series.” “Anomie” is, as the cata-
log says, ‘“‘a condition of society
marked by the absence of social
values;” the word also suggests
disorganization and personal in-
stability caused by this lack of val-

lawlessness, of moral inversion and
crumbling structure.

These paintings earn the title
that frames them through technique
and ironic treatment of subject and
theme. The paintings begin as
small collages composed of im-
ages Mesches collects with his
pocket camera and his imagina-

Mesches projects these collages
onto canvases and converts them
to paintings. Rather than being a
mere translation from one medium
to another, however, this process
transforms the images through
Mesches’ consciousness. The im-
ages are blown up and rendered
more personal, more subjective,

ues. It is a state of confusion and tion. After he makes them, through brushstroke; in this way

they come to evoke dream or, more
often, nightmare. These are social
observations and critiques double-
filtered through Mesches’ imagi-
nation.

A second effect Mesches
achieves through this filtering pro-
cess is subtlety. He is concerned
with making paintings that are too
overt in their political agenda; he
resists the pitfall of simplified alle-
gorizing or didacticism by layer-
ing his works with irony and their
own artistic history. Formal and
technical concerns are as much in
the foreground as commentary is;
the tension that results from this
relationship helps to make these

paintings successful in both the
terms that artists such as Stevens
set forth and in the terms that po-
litical artists establish.

Not to say that the social con-
cerns of these paintings are not
apparent: Mesches’ concern with
class comes through in paintings
suchas “1858; Steel,” where deca-
dent champagne drinkers are jux-
taposed with the image of a roaring
factory fire; and “1976; Bicenten-
nial,” where cascades of fireworks
celebrating democracy provide a
backdrop for an extravagant table-
setting attended to by a immacu-
