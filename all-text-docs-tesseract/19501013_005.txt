To most Cat followers, the Pres-
byterian win was the first early
pay-off from Coach Crowell Little’s
Little-T, a scrappy, speedy offense,
and a well trained defense. The
Wildcats were masters of the situa-
tion all the way, showing that they
will be no soft touch for any club
they may meet this fall.

But Possess Beefy Forward Way

Still lacking a potent attack but boasting a tough defen-
sive club, the freshman football team will open their season
here tomorrow afternoon against the junior Bulldogs from the
Citadel. Coach Boyd Baird has had his charges working hard
all week in preparation for this contest, and except for that

offense which needs sharpening up,
the Wildkittens seem to be ready.

While the Wildcats are playing
Citadel’s varsity in a Southern Con-
ference tilt at Charleston, Coach
Baird will be testing the club which
he has been molding for over a
month. The Kittens tapered off in
Thursday afternoon’s practice ses.
sions after scrimmaging the varsity
several times earlier in the week.
Johnny Gray, 15S-pound halfback,
made his way through the Cats’
defense for several long runs dur-
ing these sessions, and Preston
Whitfield plowed through the var-
sity line with the aid of some good
blocking, but in general the frosh
offense bogged down against their
heavier and more experienced op-
ponents.

Coach Baird has not made a defi-
nite decision but he may have
to follow the plan of varsity Coach
Crowell Little and use the two-
platoon system. Baird has, with
few exceptions, run the same teams
on offense and defense in scrim-
mages, but only game experience
can determine whether this system
will work for the smaller frosh
squad.

As he has stated before, Coach
Baird will not name a regular first
team until he has seen his club
game-tested. At many positions) Man.
there are several boys who have
shown up well in early drills, and
the frosh coach plans to substi-
tute freely during this opening
game. However, Baird says that
the starting lineup will look some-
thing like this:

Hershel Allen, the Georgia Crack-
er who came North for an educa-
cation, will start at quarterback.
Standing an even six feet tall, Al-
len weighs 161. To his left in the
split-T formation will’ be Johnny
Gray, the Statesville speedster, At
right half the probable starter is
Rodney Harrellson, a 170-pounder
Greensboro boy. Preston Whitfield,
another Georgia product, will start
at fullback, packing 180 pounds on
a six-foot frame.

At the ends, Lee Knott and Andy
Courts rate the nod. Courts, who
hails from Reidsville, Tennessee,
is the lightest man in the line at
150 pounds, while Knott tips the
scales at 173. Bob Loy from Allen-
town, Pa., and Neil Graham from
Hamlet will start at the tackles.
These two huskies, both weighing
190, should anchor the Kittens’ line.
Bill Putnam from Clearwater, S.
C., and Malphus Bradbury of Wil.
son are the guards. Putnam weighs
190; Bradbury, 185. P. C. Davis,
165, from Hillsboro, will hold
down the center position.

Coach Baird knows little about
the Citadel squad, but the spirit
and hustle his charges have ex-
hibited in practice sessions may

make up for what they lack in

ability against the Rullpups.

The frosh will have a rest after
this contest, as the varsity will hold
the spotlight at Homecoming, tang-
ling with Washington and Lee.
The next game on the freshman
schedule is on October 27 with
the Furman frosh.

nineteen colorful cloths represent-
ing the seventeen schools of the
Southern Conference, the United
States of America, and the state of
North Carolina, will stretch along
the track from one end of the sta-
dium to the other.

Mr. Scott also hopes to decorate
the outside of the stadium with
bunting in red and black, and the
Washington and I.ee east side with
the Generals’ bunting, but he cannot
yet be sure that the decorations
will arrive in time for use.

Perhaps the grad will let it slip
by his surveying eye, but the re-
turning newspaper and radio man
will notice an improvement in the

AFTER U.N.C, RUNNERS
LOOK TO DUKE MEET

With hardly time to catch their breath from this after-
noon’s meet with the University of North Carolina, Coach Heath

Whittle’s cross country team travels to Durham Monday morn-
ing to meet Duke’s Blue Devils. Going into today’s Southern
Conference meet. which was added to the Cat schedule only
Tuesday, the harriers had a 0-1

record after their 22-33 loss to pow-
erful N. C. State in Raleigh last
weekend.

Unfortunate question marks have
suddenly cropped in the thinclad
ranks in No, 1 man Blake Bradley
and promising soph Bob Henry. In
the loss to State, Bradley caught a
stomach cramp and Henry blacked
out. Both boys were appearantly
in good physical condition going
into meet, and had shown no ill ef-
fects from running previously this

fall. Bradley did catch a cramp on

lone occassion fast fall, at State,
and once in track last) spring.

The weakened condition of Brad-
ley and Henry definitely is harm-
ful to the Cats’ hopes for the fine
showing they had hoped for this
fall. It was indeed a contributing
factor in the State loss. As it was,
Tom Stockton carried home the
Cat colors first behind the Pack's
Clyde Garrison, sophomore sensa-
tion from High Point. The lean,
sandy-haired youngster who was
Southern Conference frosh champ-
ion last fall, is a leading contender
for the varsity conference crown
this season.

Despite his cramp, Bradley man-
aged to finish fifth, followed for the
Cats by Dick Stockton ‘in the sev-
enth spot, Bill Lee ninth, and Dan

McKeithan tenth.

In Duke. Davidson will be meet-
ing a team that is gunning for
them. The Blue Devils last year,
fresh from a win over North Caro-
lina, came to Davidson only to be
upset by Whittle’s crew over the
Cat course. At Durham, the Devils
will have the advantage of trotting
over home terrain, and they will
have the incentive for the win.

Leading the Dukes will be cap-
tain Henry Bullock, a senior from
Durham who has been for two
years one of the top half-milers in

+ the Southern Conference.

RH Shipley, whose victory over

former state prep mile champ Bob
Shoakléy paced the Kittens 27-28
win over. State's freshmen, will lead
the frosh ‘against: Lees-McRae here
Tuesday.
