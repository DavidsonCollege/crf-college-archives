Home-Coming Day Will
Be Held on Oct. 17th;

Duke - Davidson Game

This Will Be First Time in Three
Years That An Intra-State
Eleven Has Been Met on
Home-Coming

EVENT IS GROWING

Many More Alumni Return Than in

Former Years—Requests for Foot-
ball Tickets

Home-Coming Day, which is an epochal event
for Davidson College alumni, has been set for
Saturday, October 17th, this fall, which is the
date of one of the most important football
games on the Davidson gridiron. schedule. On
that date, the Wildcats engage the Duke Uni-
versity eleven, and there will be other events
arranged for the benefit of the returning for-
mer students.

This is the first time in three years that a
North Carolina eleven has been played on
Home-Coming Day, for the last two annual oc-
casions have been simultaneous with the V.
M. I. and V. P. I. contests. Alumni expressed
a wish, however, that an intra-state gridiron
machine be played, and Duke was chosen,
though it is comparatively early in the season.

The return of Davidson men during the past
half-dozen years has been gradually increasing,
until now several hundred more attend Home-
Coming than in the preceding years. Graduates
leave Davidson when they obtain their degrees

P.| in June with the thought of re-uniting for the

first time on the date set aside for the alumni
and their entertainment.

It is too early in the year to make any an-
nouncements about the events for. that day, but
the first issue of The Davidsonian is being
used to get this date firmly set in the minds
of the Davidson men. The stationery being used
in the office of Ernest Milton, executive sec-
retary, has this announcement on the bottom
of the sheet, and other information previously
sent and yet to be-mailed to the Davidson
alumni has included and will include informa-
tion about that day.

Although application blanks for the football
game are being mailed today, the executive
secretary stated that several requests for ‘tickets
had already been received, and that many other
alumni had written that they expect to be here.
