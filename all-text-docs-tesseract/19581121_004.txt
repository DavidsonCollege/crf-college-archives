Freshman Council Has
Important Functions =

Davidsonian Feature Writer
During the freshman orientation period of every
school year, the members of each of the twenty fresh-
man, groups elect a representative. These men together |

This council! has no legislative
authority in itself, but its ef-
fectiveness is derived from per-
sonal or group influence. The
council stands as a link between
the freshman class and existing
authority. Its initial purpose
lies in assisting the class in be-
coming an integral part of the
student body of Davidson.

effort to make them conform
to freshman standards of con-

that the positive influence of
the freshman class towards
this problem will affect the
attitude of the entire student

held sometime around the mid-
dle of November. Yearly the
response to this event increases,
this year the council acting as
host to 321 persons, 258 of
whom were freshman parents.

The annual freshman-sopho-
more field day under the co-
ordinate directorship of the
Court of Control and Fresh-
man Council is e primary con-
cern of the committee. Fresh-
man participation in the Field
Day leadership has a dominat-
ing, positive influence on the
other members of the class
as to response.

The .council also activates
open discussion groups on mat-
ters pertinent to the general
life of the freshman at David-
son. This council acts as an ex-
ploratory opportunity for fresh-
man, as through it the class can
express individual and collec-
tive opinion on various matters.
The council can then relay
these thoughts to persons con-
cerned, thus acting as a medi-
ary.

Its purpose is not to engender
revolt, or to encourage unwar-
ranted criticism of existing tra-
ditions of the college but to
offer an outlet for constructive
criticism by freshmen.

The council members them-
selves are by no means distinct
from the class. They are not
asked or expected to behave in
a manner contrary to normal
freshman sentiment.

They do, however, try to act
as a beneficial influence by in-
voking thought among the class
concerning unnecessary  out-
bursts of resentment against
authority, whether it be repre-
sented by administration or up-
perclassmen.

The council, composed of
fresh, open minds, uninfluenced
as of yet by Davidson tradition,
is in a position to question the
necessity of some of these tra-
ditions and relate in an unau-
thoritative fashion the results
of these findings to those con-
cerned.

One of the major projects
of the council this year is

dents.

Several changes have been
made in “Euphony” this year.
First of all. it will be open for
contributions by the entire stu-
dent body.

In the past, “Euphony” has
been a journal of liberal opin-
ion, but it is now widening its
scope to include poetry, fiction,
and drama by the students.

Co-edited this year by Frank
Nye and Don Stowell. “Eu-
phony” hopes to meet a great
need of the school: an outlet
for creative writing, which the
Eumenean Society feels is very
important.

The deadline for contributions
is December 5. All copy should
be typed, double-spaced, and
have a word count. It can be
given to Frank Nye in 134

Currie Announces
New Dorm Plans

Robert Currie, Davidson Bus-

liminary plans for a new dormi-
tory as part of the Dana Chal-
lenge. The projected building
will house 135 students, and
will raise Davidson's capacity to
1000.

This structure, to be erected
behind Belk Dormitory, will be
about fifty per cent larger than
Little, and will cost approxi-
mately $375,000, The exact loca-
tion has not yet been decided,

puller. They had a nice fight,
but were soon pulled apart.
Those who would forget were
not permitted, so the cat stayed
around D. C. until the athletes
needed a name, and the next I
knew the “Wild Cats” were
leading the athletes.”

This is one possibility as
to how the traditional “WILO-
CATS” got their name. tn the
1917 “Quips & Cranks” the
football team is referred to as
the “Presbyterians” or the

“Red and Blacks.” However |;

in the 1918 annual the ‘Wild-
cat” mame is used to refer
to the team.

An old clipping from the DA-
VIDSONIAN sstates that 4fter
the Georgia Tech-Davidson foot-
ball game of the '17-'18 school
year, the term ‘Wildcats” came
into use. The story relates that
after the bruising battle, which
Tech won by 32-12, an Atlanta
Journal sports writer exclaimed
how “The Red and Black fought
like a bunch of Wildcats.” The
local press picked up the ex-
pression and since that time all
of Davidson’s athletic teams
have carried the title.

Mr. Albert 5. Potts, ‘19,
claims to have begun the
nickname himself. He says:
“At that time, Davidson teams
had no. definite nickname,
and the newspapers referred
to our teams as the ‘Preach-
ers’ and other random nick-
names which did not seem to
suit the fighting qualities and
high spirit of Davidson teams
(No disparagement meant). So

a term for Davidson teams
in the stories | was writing,
and so far as | know, that was
the beginning of this usage,
and it has continued ever
since. Maybe there are more
authentic stories, but this is
mine and I'll stick to it.”
Professor Henry T. Lilly has
this to add to the meaning be-
hind our nickname. He says: “t

Phi Delt, Sigma Nu
Hold Parents’ Day

Two of Davidson's fraterni-
ties, Phi Delta Theta and Sigma
Nu, were hosts to alumni and
parents during the past week-
end.

Brothers of Phi Delta Theta
served as hosts for the fraterni-
ty’s first Alumni-Parents week-
end. Alumni representing class-
es from 1924 to 1958 were in
attendance, and parents of nu-
merous brothers and pledges

end was the house dedication
ceremony at 12:15 p.m. Sat-
urday. Following the invoca-
tion by Or. L. |. Stell of Char-
lotte, fraternity president

the guests of the fraternity.
Alumni Secretary Brantley
Burns then presented to Pres-
ident Emmrich and the fra-
ternity » plaque recognizing
those persons whose signifi-
cant contributions helped
make the furnishing of the
new house possible. A dedica-
tion litany was led by Mr.
Bill Rembert, class of 1939,
from. Dallas, Texas.

Following the dedication afd
luncheon, the guests attended
the Davidson-Richmond football
game.

Saturday evening a banquet
was held in the College Union
ballroom, at which College Pres:
ident and Mrs. Grier Martin
and the fraternity’s Faculty Ad-
visor, Dr. J. Y. Causey, and his
wife were honored guests. Mr.

the fraternity’s General Coun-
cil, was the featured speaker
of the evening, talking on the
accomplishments and aims of
Phi Delta Theta.

Deutscher Verein
Birth Anticipated

Delta Phi Alpha early this
week announced plans for the
formation of a new German
club, Deutscher Verein. A for-
mal proposal for the birth of
Deutscher Verein will come be-
fore an open meeting of the
fraternity to be held Tuesday
night, November 25, at 9:15, in
the ballroom of the Student
Union.

The new organization will
open its membership to all stu-
dents interested in any phase
of German culture. Delta Phi
Alpha has requested that those
persons wishing to join the club
attend the open meeting Tues-
day night.

The activities of Deutscher
Verein for the coming year wiil
include films concerning Ger-
man: culture, current events,
and panel discussions led by the
three foreign students who are
now members of the honorary
fraternity. If the interest from
the membership is great, Delta
Phi Alpha plans also to ask a
member of the German Em-
bassy in Washington to. speak
to the club.
