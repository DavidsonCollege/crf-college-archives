Committee présents budget,

cites four income sources

By BRAD SWALWELL
Senior News Editor

The faculty Budget, Build-
ings, and Grounds Committee
presented the tentative college
budget for 1976-1977 at an
open meeting in Perkins Audi-
torium last Wednesday.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. opened the meet-
ing with some remarks on the
sources of increased expenses
and revenues for next year.

Spencer explained the
changes as increased costs of
necessities, increases in sala-
ries and wages, and increases
requested by the various de:
partments of the college.

Spencer cited four general
sources of augmenting the
college’s income.

“The income for the endow-
ment next year is down. We
actually have more than $1
million more in endowment,
but because we operate on a
three year rolling average for
endowment income, income
will be down,” said Spencer.

‘There has been a small
increase in gifts and trusts.
We feel that we have about
reached the limit on adding
additional students. That only
leaves increased: student fees.
We are checked here by a
desire not to price ourselves
out of the market,’ he conti-
nued.

Spencer indicated that the
college had enough additional
income to cover the increases
in the cost of necessities and
wage and salary increases,
but not the requested in-
creases for the college depart-
ments.

‘‘That’s what this budget
has done. We have. had to cut
out the requested additions in
most cases,”’ said Spencer.

College Comptroller Robert

W. Davidson then presented
the budget. He-explained how
the committee had estimated
the income the college would
receive next year.

Davidson emphasized that
this was only a tenative bud-
get and would remain so until
the Trustees act on it later this
month.

“We went through the exer-
cise of trying to estimate our
income from all students. Our
estimate is based on a pro-
jected increase in tuition of
$200 and a rise in enrollment
of 15 students.

‘‘For our endowment in-
come, we operate on the total
returns principle. We take the
market value of all our securi-
ties for the last three years and

average them. We guarantee’

ourselves five percent of this
as income,” said Davidson.

A question arose as to how
much money had been allo-
cated for psychological coun-
seling. Dean of Students Will
H. Terry answered, saying
that the salary for one of the
counselors now comes from
faculty salaries. That particu-
lar counselor will be leaving
after Fall term next year.

“Actually, the same amount
of money has been allocated
for the counselors. We will
not, however, have the extra
money from faculty salaries
after Fall term. I am going to
try and manipulate the budget
in order to keep the five full
days of counseling which we
have this year,”’ said Terry.

Spencer answered a quest-
ion on the status of the Office
for Experiential Learning.
on the status of the Office for
Experiential Learning. ‘‘Next
year is the first year that the
college will have to bear the
full burden of the program. Up
to now, the office has been
funded from a HEW grant.
Approxiately $3,000 was cut
from the Experiential Learn-
ing budget.

The meeting ended with a
discussion of faculty salary
increases. '

excess of income over expendi-
tures projected for next year.

Professor of Philosophy
John J. Young asked if the
whole $240,580 figure would
go to such salary incréases.
Davidson replied that it would

not. Os
Former SGA President

John Munce offered some
general comments on the bud-
get meeting.

‘‘One needed a more than
average familiarity with not
only the operation of the
budget process but also the
operation of the college to be
able to get anything from the
budget figures,’’ he said.

Preyer changes barred by
insufficient outside funding

By CATHY LANDIS
Asst. Features Editor

The Preyer Infirmary, is
understaffed, obsolete, and
under-funded, according to
Head Nurse Dorothy Sherrill
and Dean of Students Will H.
Terry. Few measures have
been taken to remedy the
situation. =

The first area of need is
equipmental. The insufficient
heating facilities create
discomfort for both patients
and nurses. In order to heat
the men’s ward adequately the
women’s ward upstairs and
the front rooms on the ground
floor become unbearably hot.

Sherrill feels that each room
should, ideally, contain its
own electric heating system so
that the temperature in each
room could be controlled
separately.

Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze Jr.
indicated concern over the
situation and is taking steps
to initiate short-term repairs.
Meetze commented that ‘'The
main thing to consider is
what’s going to be the opera-
tion of the place in the next
five years.”’

The College does not yet
know whether or not the
infirmary will be relocated,
whether or not its parking
situation will be improved, or
whether or not the Town of
Davidson will involve itself
with the infirmary.

“It’s easy to renovate the
building as it is,’’ said Meetze,
‘‘but since the situation is
giong to be changed it would
be a waste of money ‘for
short-run renovation.

The infirmary is also in need
of a*part-time custodian. At
the moment, any cleaning-up
must be done by the nurses.

Sherrill added that when the
infirmary was built the college
saw the need for a janitor. At

that time the college enrolled
five hundred students. Now,
with an enrollment of 1200,
there is no janitor in the

infirmary.
The infitmary presently
employs three full-time

nurses and one part-time

‘ nurse. In order to allow them

all to receive one full day off
they must put in 12-hour
shifts. Terry does not see the
adding of another nurse as
realistic in the near future.
Because there’ is normally

only one nurse on duty, who
must remain with patients,
prescriptions sometimes must
wait to be filled. Mail services
are delayed; throat cultures
taken on one day, for instance.
cannot be sent out until the
next.

Other equipmental deficien-
cies cannot be taken care of so
easily due to the uncertain
future of the present infirma-
ry. The beds are ancient and
uncomfortable, according to
students. The bell service in
the men’s ward is wearing
down and there are no working
televisions or other recreation-
al facilities.

Both cooks and nurses
expressed. the need for a
dumbwaiter or elevator to
transport both food and
patients to the second floor.

The doctors have expressed
a need for a microscope as one
of the primary medical sup-

‘‘Generally, everything is
obsolete,”’ said Sherrill.

These deficiencies cannot be
solved until the infirmary is
out of its period of transition.

Since errands and emergen-
cies occur only occasionally, it
is unfeasible to hire a full-time
errand boy. Terry feels that a
volunteer service consisting of
students willing to run errands
should be created.

Sherrill indicated that a list
of those students and their
telephone numbers would
enable nurses to contact avail-
able help when necessary.

Terry recommended that
this same group form a
shuttle-service to solve the
problem of transportation.
Many students do not have
access to transportation and
need it in cases such as high
fevers and broken legs, when
it is unfeasible for them to
walk to the infirmary.

The physicians themselves
add to the infirmary problems.
Students are not able to see
the same doctor twice and
occasionally complain that
those they do see do not
examine them. Doctor Ele-
thorpe has been working four
days a week since Christmas,
however. This alleviates some
of the problem.

A major barrier facing reno-
vation is funding. According
to Terry the money will be a
Capital Funds Item. ‘‘As I
understand it, we will have to
go outside the college for
funding,’”’ he said.
