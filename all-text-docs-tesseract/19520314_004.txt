PONDERS QUESTION

i

nh

Caught by the camera's eye in momentary thought before reply-
ing to an interviewer's question, campus figure George “Leroy”
Brownie strikes a pose familiar to those who have known and talked
with him. Prominent in the community, George is known for his
wont to go into lengthy lecture at the slightest provocation. (Photo

George Bares All
In Exclusive Story

I found him coming out of Ratliff’s Eco. with that smug
look on his face. I shouted to George as I elbowed through the
crowd, but he only glanced my way and headed for chapel.

I could tell right then this was
going to be a tough interview. “I'll
catch him after chapel,” I thought.

But no. He decided to help the
janitors clean up. I knew if he saw
me coming he would shun me, so I
got on all fours and waited for him
at the end of a row. “Now Il get
to talk to him face to face.” But I
was wrong again. As George backed
out at the row he gave me the old
raised-eyebrow treatment.

“Now look here. George, be
teasonable. Just a few questions.
Do you think Truman will run
and if so what are his chances?”

I could see George was ponder-
ing my query and I waited for his
well thought out answer. Just as 1
thought the answer was on his
chops he suddenly remembered he
was due down at the P. O. to see
that everyone got the right mail.

He wheeled and was off with me
at his heels. I couldn't keep up
with him, so when we got to the
stoplight I got upon my feet to
trot along beside him, pencil and
pad in hand.

“The Middle-East! The Mid-
dle East, George. What's the
solution to that problem?” At
last he answered.

How simple can you humans get!
The solution is obvious.” Or at
least that’s how I interpreted his
sigh.

Then George lay down at the
“square” by the traffic light and
watched for speeders. Occasionally
a speeder would go by and I could
tell that behind George's innocent
look he was making a mental note
of the offense. To get the best re-
sults from an interview you must
put yourself on a level with your
subject—make him feel at case.

As George and I sprawled on

the sidewalk in the warm mid-

morning sun, I asked my next

question. “Is it true your an-
cestor was the dog used by

Paviov in his famous saliva ex-

periment?” I could tell I had

hit a sore spot with George.

He lowered his majestic head be-
tween his outstretched paws, Was
this sad philosopher withholding
something from me? Was there
some scandal in his family back-
ground? Did his family tree have
some rotten branches? I took: his
silence as a sign of encouragement
and prodded him further. “George,
you can tell me. Speak freely eee
it will make you feel better.”

He looked at me in deep
thought and I saw a tear creep
into his eye (or was it phlegm?)

I understood. “No, George.

This won't get any further than

you and me,” I promised,

The relief that came over him was:
a joy to see. He pulled himself up
on his haunches and unfolded the
story of his family. It was one of
the true, great tragedies of our time.
By the time.-he finished several dogs
had gathered around to listen and
some were sniffling. I felt choked
up inside, His was a story of tender
love, hate, passion, violence.

But an oath is an oath and I had
vowed not to print it.

Mr. Copeland began complaining
that we were blocking all the traf-
fic that his store usually. gets, but
George just ignored him as only
George can ignore, His expression
was easy to read,

All over his face was written
“WHO does he think he is?” Any
taxpayer should know common law
as applied under the Magna Carta
gives dogs pre-empted rights to
authenticate thejr perigmations un-
der the ‘vindictive eye of diabolical
machinations at unprepossed bar-
barians under the Ordinance No.
8, Davidson township, section A-6.
It was in long hand, too.

But it was time for George to
act in his capacity of board-
ing house inspector.

I wanted to ask him many, many
more questions—how he lost his
tail, his favorite movie star, was he
once dishonorably discharged from
the Saint Bernard Rescue Team for
drinking his own whiskey, etc., but
T knew his noble heart was already

too burdened with the cares of the

world to bother with such triviali-
ties.

As he was about to leave, I
asked softly if he was worried
about losing some of his pop-
ularity to that up-and-coming
brown-and-white pup Ztalgru.
His yawn and sigh seemed a clear

cnough answer, Then he turned
and with his massive head held
high plodded off dows the street,
his mind already on some higher
plane of ethereal thought.

on a visit to Europe she met and
talked with the famous Irish pa-
triot, Terrence McSweeney, several
hours before a hunger strike lead-
ing to his death.

The story resulting from this

- chance interview marked Miss

Thompson’s debut as a jour-

nalist.

She spent 17 years in Vienna and
Berlin for the Curtis newspapers,
the Philadelphia Public Ledger, and
the New York Evening Post. When
she took over the important Berlin
office of the New York Evening
Post, she was the first woman ever
to hold such a position for the
American press.

She wrote several articles on
Hider before his rise to power
in 1933. After the publication
of her book, “I Saw Hitler,”
in 1934, she was ordered out.
of Germany and permanently
denied permission to return.
Miss Thompson's other books in-

clude “Refugees: Anarchy or Or-
ganization,” “Dorothy Thompson's
Political Guide.” and “Let the
Record Speak." Her newspaper
column, “On the Record,” is dis-
tributed by the Bell Syndicate to
such newspapers as The Boston
Globe, St. Louis Post Dispatch,
Chicago News, Detroit News, and

The appointments to the Faculty
Conference Committee were an-
nounced here today. For the faculty
Dr. Cunningham has named Dr.
Puckett as chairman, and Profes-
sors Ostwalt and Plott to complete
the selection; for ODK Pete Kalo-
gridis has been selected, Also in-
cluded on the committee are the
presidents of the three upper classes
and the freshman advisor.

The reactivation of the commit-
tee was caused by the recognition
by the faculty of certain requests
for this action. The step took place
at the March meeting of the faculty.

It is believed that the first meet-
ing will be held in the near future,
and that the meetings are to be
open ones,

It was in the 1938-39 session that
the original committee was estab-
lished, Dr. Spencer noted, in giving
some background on the committee.
