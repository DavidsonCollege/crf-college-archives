THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINION S MONDAY, MARCH 14, 1994

Take a retreat from the modern excuse for intimacy.

(4
Techition, a sense of lack of

profound contact with other hu- .

man beings, seems to be the dis-
ease of our time.”--Allan Bloom

See Juliet on the balcony, gaz-
ing at the stars, lamenting every
moment spent apart from her love.
Now see fair Romeo, pacing in the
garden, nervously rehearsing his
punch line: “Honey, I’m just not
ready for a commitment.”

Did Romeo and Juliet have a
relationship? Does literature’s
purest example of love show even
traces of such reductionism? The
emptiness of the word “relation-
ship” wrongly implies that the two
star-crossed souls were simply iso-
lated beings, forming an artificial,
temporary bond. Being together
bridged the vast chasm between
them, saving them from their lone-
liness. Acommitmentto each other
was the one thing that they had
been waiting for all their lives.

In objection,.1 must presume
that a passionate love had already
consumed Shakespeare’s quintes-
sential couple before they had even
met. | am referring to the element

which we in modern day America
have come to lack.

Are people really just wan-
dering atoms, longing to cluster

‘with another for fulfillment and.

needing a contract to ensure that
commitment? Can we really be
reaching the potential of human

these changes, reducing our sacred
instincts for love to a science. In
many ways, we are no longer souls,
but animals. We eat, sleep, and
have sex, and talk about the three
as if they belong in the same cat-
egory. We assume that an agree-
ment with another person will re-

more destructive than successful.
Truly, whether trapped in a quest
for “community” or fora “partner”

in life, our isolation is continuing

to increase.

More and more, people are
becoming addicted to that one per-
son who will be the substitute for

lationships of my own past, I have The very nature of intimacy with seeing people as they really

‘decided that our needs, as a human

race, go far beyond the simplicity
of a mere commitment to another
person.

Isolation is a disease that is
spreading throughout our nation.
As technology flourishes, the
beauty of natural human tenden-
cies fades further and further away.
Our language has evolved with

and love is being reduced to a
scientificsexology, with Freud and
his studies at the helm. With each
study that degrades humans to the
status of mere lab rats, we grow
further away from knowing the

. passionate love of the characters in

Shakespeare.
Efforts to analyze human pas-
sion have, on a large scale, proven

are, with their beauties and their
flaws. Just as a sensitivity to the
taste of food will help a bulimic
recover from her disorder, a sensi-

tivity to people will stop one from:

using others to satisfy her demand
for love.

Toall my friends who sirupsie
with relationship problems, to the
crowds in singles’ bars across the

nation who mingle night after night
in search of the answer to their
prayers, and to the person already
in a relationship who finds that all
of her needs are not being met in

_her boyfriend, I propose this ex-

planation.

Referring ‘to that ideal, self-
less passion that Romeo and Juliet
shared with and for one another,
my guess is that Madonna’s bet
was right - they never really could
have felt that way. In fact, no one
has ever lived alife of perfect love.

‘Echoes of their love can be
felt in the first stages of a romance,
and we read the play because, in
remembering different times in our
lives, we find that we can relate.

The ideal relationship does not
exist, however, and we must stop
searching for it. We must instead
make the decision to endure our
lives and our situations with grace
and faithfulness. Ironically, we
will then grow sensitive to the
beauty of human intimacy around
us. We might even become pre-
pared to have that destiny mani-
fested in our own lives.

Everything you want to know before you graduate

What continued from page 7

(6) Why does the Infirmary

have only two different prescrip--

tions for almost any sort of ail-
ment? From sniffles to syphilis,
from indigestion to influenza, from
. strep throat to strychnine poison-
~ ing, from flu to phlegm—take two
of their blue or red tablets and call
back inthe moming. =~ —
(7) Why do we no longer have
bells to announce the beginning
- and ending of classes? This used
to be a great help for both students
and professors. Since my watch
broke about one month ago, 1 have
not been certain if | am late to
class. These bells used to give the

protessors the right to stare usdown |

as we were tardy to class. When |
used to hear those bells my fresh-

man year, | would at least know to.

feel guilty when | walked in late.
Now I just hope the professor isn’t
sure what time'it-is. . .

Also, since the elimination of
the bells, I have noticed the ten- .
dency for professors to hold their
classes longer. (The bells used to
be a good hint for professors that

the hour is finished).

(8). Is one of the Davidson:
police officers really a professional
wrestler?

-° (9)* Who named one of the
rooms in the Union, the Big Screen
Room? Inall my years at Davidson,
I don’t think I have ever located the
“Big Screen.”

_ (10) Who invented the hinge |
design on the Chambers’ outside
doors? To begin with, the doors
are extremely heavy and could
potentially mow over someone
with their back swing. I have hor-
rors of an 80-year-old lady getting
bopped in the head and suing the
pants off of Davidson.

(11) Ihave heard rumors that
every year several people have
climbed up on Chambers’ dome at

night. | heard you could even see
Charlotte’s skyline! If this is true,
I am curious to know who is re-
sponsible for keeping the doors/
windows unlocked, which allows
this kind of activity to be possible.
I’m not trying to sound like a party
pooper, but i isn’t that-kind of dan-
gerous?

(12), Has anybody really been
locked inthe library at night in
orden tb deatterts Ef apechievous
things? © (Khave heard of all kinds
of fun games that could be played
in the library after hours—Laser
Tag, Hide and Seek,: and Library
Tag. Soupyitike beings kictagain,
huh?) .

If you have any answers to the
questions I have presented, let me
know. Maybe | could write a
follow up article to inform the stu-
dent body. None of us should
graduate from Davidson without
knowing suchi Aiporian facts about
our school.

Adoption and impermanence

Being a supporter of adoption, I
was surprised to learn recently of
some arguments against it. They
surfaced in.the wake of the. Baby
Jessica mess, and the most radical
of which can only be called illogi-
cal.

This ordeal raised questions

‘about the nature of adoption in

general. According toaNewsweek
article by Steven Waldman and
Lincoln Caplan printed March 21,

1994, the arguments focus on two.

major points: race and feminist
abortion politics.

Racially blind adoption is a
common occurrence because there

- is agreater number of black babies

put up for adoption than there are
black prospective parents. Beyond
what this says about this country

- socially, it shows that there are

many white couples out there who
want a child so much that the issue
of race is completely peripheral.

The situation created, how-
ever, causes a great deal of discon-
tent. For example, the National
Association of Black Social Work-
ers has declared that transracial
adoption is “cultural-genocide,”
and that it exists because white
families want to raise black chil-

dren with the minds of whites.

(Newsweek).

Bologna. Transracial adop-
tion is an indirect answer to the
problem plaguing so many black
families. It is a sad but true fact
thata shocking percentage of black
families live in poverty and with-

out a male role model. I do not
contend that the white family is a
Rockwellian example of purity, but
the chances of a young black child
being adopted intoa stable, healthy
family situation is far greater than
if he or she remains with the natu-
ral, and most likely single, mother.

The other arena is abortion.
According to Newsweek, some
feminists oppose adoption because,
by supporting it, they would con-
cede credibility to anti-abortion
forces. This is a selfish and cruel

philosophy.

In the Boston Women’s Book
Collective’s publication Our Boa-
ies, Ourselves, the following quote
appears: “Feminists have been slow |
to recognize adoption’s exploita-
tion of their sisters.”

This does not make sense. It
would seem more logical for the
pro-choice camp to support adop-
tion, which is yet another choice
for pregnant women. The quote
above makes me think that some
people who call themselves pro-
choice are merely pro-abortion.

Adoption is the only chance
some children will get to have a.
stable, secure family: And it is the
only chance some couples will get
to raise a child.

The love between a child and
his parents is not colored by race,
and the life of a child is not an
exploitation.

A woman at an adoption rally
carried a sign that saidit all: “Don’t
throw them away. I’Il take them.”

to The Davidsonian. We thought it
would be interesting to see how
easily satire was picked up in the
opinion section of our paper here

at Davidson. I hope I didn’toffend

went well. I enjoyed the talk I
