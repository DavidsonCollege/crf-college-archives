Practice Starts
For Baseballers

By JOE EARLE
“Sports Writer

While Davidson's football
team prepares for its entry
into the public eye with the
opener at Richmond next
week, the members of the
baseball team are also in
the midst of their practice.

Fall, practice is a chance
for the team recruits to show
their prowess and for old
members to prepare for
training once again.

“Since we only have a few
weeks of spring to prepare
for thé regular season, which
will begin in the middle of
March, we give the boys a
chance to work out early in
the fall. This practice will
end sometime in October."’
Stevens said.

The team adds only four
freshmen this year: Frank
Williams, infield; Larry Rud-
dell, outfield; Frank Folger
first base, pitcher and out-
field; and Alec ‘‘Hawk"’ Hoon,

Few recruits were needed
to fill the squad since they
“lost only one player last
year. We are a young team.
Most of our boys are sopho-
mores and _ juniors,” com-
mented Stevens. That
player was Gordon Slade,
all-region outfielder who was
offered a professional con-
tract. @

Harold Wilkerson will cap-
tain the eam his year. Lead
pitching spots will probably
be held by Rick Pipan, Jim
Case, and Mike Frye, ac-
cording to Stevens. Lynn
Wagner will likely be lead
ner will likely be lead bat-
batter. Wagner hit .300 last
year. Other returning start-
ers include Randy Ely who
“very tough on defense” and
is ‘‘very tough on defense”
and Bob Meadows.

Stevens will be assisted
in fall training by Captain
Halight, of ROTC, and Jack
Burris of Davidson.

IMA'C_ PREVIEW

Delts, Sigs Picked For Title

By HOWARD BOYD
Sports Writer

The IMAC unveiled its
new look as the 1970 flicker-
ball campaign got under-
way. This year there are
two 9-team divisions, with
freshmen competing against
upperclassmen.

Despite the wholesale
changes, one thing remains
the same: Phi Delta Theta
(ho-hum) is the favorite. The
Delts, winners of their last
36 games and champions the
past two seasons, appear as
strong or stronger than ever,
and loom the overwhelming
choice in Division A.

Division A
Delts ‘(1969 record: 13-0)

Soph TB Bick Halligan
must fill the shees' of grad-
uated Bill Traxler, but he
has great potential. Hamp
Whittington and all-IMAC
Gene Early at halfback, and
ends Jack Steele and All-
IMAC Jeff Chetwood are
back to lead a potent at-
tack. Safety Walter Sprunt,
defensive backs Jim Wright
and’ Hugh Gaither, and end
Keith Onsdorff and Barden
Cooke spearhead the de-
fense. Top sophs besides
Halligan include Mike Deese
and Greg) McCall.

2. KAs (8-4)

With more speed and some
good sophs, the KAs hope to
offset the loss of IMAC
tailback Romey Fisher.
Soph Bob Solberg inherits

Fisher's post with all- IMAC
Steve Williams and soph
Sandy McLean at the half-
backs. Tom Jeter, Sammy
Fisher, Charlie Terrell and
Jim Crouse age other return-
ees. Other sophs expected to
help are Daryl Williams,
Jimmy Moye and Elliot Sa-
vage.

3. SAE (7-5)

Tailback Bob Meadows
keys the SAE attack, with
Roy Camphell, Armfield
Cannon, Dave \\Faison and
Charlie Pope back +o help
him. A host of Sophs figure
to see action, among whom
are David Weaver, George
Thomas, Tommy Reed,
Dave Varner, Bruce Baird,
Neil Trask and Newell Ro-
binson. The E's are green,
but have more depth and
speed. A lot will depend on
Meadows.

4. ATO (3-9)

The Taus have a veteran
ballclub and should be vast-
ly improved. The offense is
led by TB Chipper Jones,
halfback Doug Hickman, and
receivers Mort Chiles
Reeves Louthan and Jim
Hawkins. Bill Sherwood, Ro-
ger Mills and Jim Roy are
on the defense. Pp sophs
are Rhett. Talbert, Mitchell
Johnson, Kent Breard and
Joel Bradley.

5. Sigma Chi (5-7)

The Machis hope to right
themselves after a lacklust-

er campaign in 1969. Herb
Clegg, John Saunders, Doug
Haynes, Reif Kessler, Rick
Weddle, Walt Walker, Adam
Robinson and Jim Hudson
are experienced — seniors.
Juniors Jack Latimer and
Bob Randall return also.
Lack of depth will hurt this
squad, Sigma Chi must be
rated a question mark,

6. Sigma Nu (6-6)

The Nus were hit hard by
graduation and will depend
mostly on sophomores. Wal-
ter McAlhaney, David Scar
borough and Dick Morrison
are top vets. Key sophs will
be Skip Greathouse, Scott
Beard, Charlie Davis and
Jim Doss. A rebuilding
vear for the Nus.

7. Pi Kaps (0-12)

The much-maligned Pi
Kaps are banking on sever-
al good sophs to lead them
out of the doldrums, and
could surprise. Zack Mob-
ley, Frank Kirtley and Tom
Sinks are the top players
back, but sophs Pat Curley
and Ron Altman appear to
be the team leaders. Jim-
my Hunter, Jim Thompson,
Phil Drake and Clint McCann
are other newcomers  heavi-
ly counted upon.

The two freshman~ teams
will be woefully inexperi-
enced, and are unknown

quantities at this time.

Division B
1, Kappa Sigs (6-6)

The Sigs should be vast-
ly improved, with what may
be the most talented team in
the IMAC: They open with
Bill Barnhill at TB, all-IMAC
Dave Russell and Ben Lacy
at the halfs, sand Frank
Clark and Paul Whetsell the

ends. Cooper Geraty, Billy
Mohr and Bryan Peterson
are other stalwarts. Sophs
Randy Webster and Pete

Another strong, experienc

TB, and a good one. Ray

tively, in 1969. Floyd Strand

at linebacker, along with

All-IMAC performers Buzz

rely on quickness and speed
but lack depth. Wade Shcp-

work, “the boys really seem
to appreciate our fixing the
‘green stuff’ for them to

She jokingly remarked that
the soccer tearh was be-
coming envious.

Explaining her reasons for
taking the job, Karen remak-
ed that she- was interested
in taking a sailing course in
P. E. and was talking to
Coach Sterling Martin about
the matter. ‘Ran Coble came

be a manager. I thought he
was joking, but the next day
I found out he wasn’t.”

Karen’s primary task is
secretarial work, which -in-
volves keeping records of

runners’ times and their dis-
tances and doing other paper
work for Coach-Martin.

Carter, an attractive blonde
who began helping Karen
this week, noted that an im-
portant job is “‘ke@ping up
with how many blisters they
get.” She also commented
that “‘it’s great to be out here
and able to watch everything,
like cross country, soccer
and football.”

Each girl expressed quite
an enthusiasm for Davidson
and for its sports program.
Karen commented that she
had “gotten to know lots of
people in the athletic depart-
ment,” while Carter added
that “there wasn’t even a
field at Mary Baldwin.”

Coach Martin has been well
pleased with the female
assistants. ‘‘They have given
the guys an emotional lift,
and we try to treat them as
‘one of the boys’. Noting
their limitation to clerical
work, Martin jokingly stated
that “the girls haven’t given
any rubdowns yet.”

From the ‘eagerness of the ,

team members to climb the
final hill of the course, it is
apparent that the initiative
of the young ladies has been
greatly... appreciated. - Per-
haps they have opened an
additional outlet to the pro-
ponents of Woman's Libera-

Wildcats Hunt ‘Quail’;

Season Opens T

By ERNIE SHIPE
Sports Editor

The Wildcats intend to go

“quail-hunting’’ this week-
end.
The ‘‘Quail"’. i§ better

known as Charlie Richards
who operates the Richmond
offense.

Davidson will also be out
to answer many other ques-
tions when they meet the
Spiders at eight o'clock to-
morrow night at Richmond
City Stadium.

The Spiders tied the Wild-
cats for the Southern Con-
ference Championship last
year as @ach team finished
with 5-1 records. In their
1969 meeting, the Wildcats
finished on top, 37-7.

Richards is kindly called
“Quail’"’ by his teammates
for his love of hunting and
fishing. He also loves to
throw a football and does it
well.

in the league, Betas need
only staying power to rank
with the best. TB Jay
Bowen, halfback |. Tommy
Richardson, and end John
Douglas are top stars. Hen-
ry Marrow and Steve Eng-
strom on offense, and Jim-
my Trussell and Trip Adams
on defense lend experience.
Randy Ely, Bill Burwell
and Harry Lankanau head a
good crop of sophs.

5. Phi Gamms (4-8)

The Gamms

have more
experience this year but
lack the speed to be big
winners. TB Scott Nichol

son, Ed Dietrich, Roy Lane —

and Graham McGooghan
are capable performers, go-
ing both ways. Sophs who

w:ll help are Peter Morgan,

David Wymer and Bruce
Batten.

6. Indies (3-9)

As usual, an unknown
quantity. Jim  Trevathan,
John (McCammon, Charlie

Ralston, Don Parman, Mike
Hyrne and transfer Scott
McMichael will all play, and
depending on who else does
and how well the Indies can
organize themselves, they
could be pretty good. Past
experience, though, makes
them more likely sixth or
lower.
7. East 1, Cannon 1 and
Watts-Belk

These teams do not have
enough experience to com-
pete on an even basis, but
they may surprise. A ¢om-
pletely unknown’ quantity,
but most likely seevnth thru
ninth.

» the, Spider's most

He wound up the season as
the No. 5 offensive player in
the nation with 2,665 yards
and respons‘ble for 24 touch-
downs.

“Richards is extremely
quiet but has a great deal
of inner confidence in his
own ability,” said Offensive
Backfield Coach Jim Tait.
“He knew he could do the
job when a lot of people
questioned it. He probably
has the finest throwing arm
we've had here at Richmond
with the ability to make the
great throw.”

The 63, 198-pound senior
from Miami, Florida passed
for 327 yards in his first two
games, connecting on 3 of
67 passes. The Spiders won
their opener, 21-6, from
North Carolina State but
lost last week to West Vir-
ginia, 49-107

Coach Dave Fagg agrees
that Richmond has ‘an ex-
cellent ball club. ‘They
played an impressive first
half against West Virginia,
Playing them even the en-
tire half."

Tomorrow's contest will be

Fagg's initial trial as David-
son’s head coach. It will al-
so be the first time ‘the Wild-
cat's show off their new
wishbone offense, Another
‘question to be answered is
how Fagg can accomodiate
the loss of five All-Confer-
ence selections.

The Wildcat secondary is
faced probably with it’s
toughest assignment of the
Season tomorrow, night. This
is one of Davidson's strongest
area’s and will be severely
tested as Richards throw’
to Jim  Livesay, Livesay
snared 13 passes for 137
yards in the Spider's first
two games.

Buddy Woodle, Frank
Mauro, and Frank Olepack
w.ll also test the Wildcat’s
defense. Woodle has _ been
impres-
sive runner this season.
Against North Carolina State
the Junior tailback rushed
for 104 yards.

The defensive unit was hit
by ‘a rash of injuries last
week but Fagg sees every-
body prepared to go except
Woody Montgomery who is
sidelined with a broken arm.
Junior Joe Poteat will start
at ‘Montgomery's middle

linebacking position.

Davidson's offense will be
up against a Richmond de-
fensive unit that was 13th in
the nation last séason. Spid-
er defenders have been
successful as they have
already allowed their op-
ponents to rush for 640 yards
in two contests.

Mark Thompson will test
his arm against a‘tovgh se-
condary that has only al-
lowed 140 yards per contest.
Ray Easterling is a good
bet to win All-Conference
honors at cornerback. East-
erling will be joined at corn-
erback by Wayne Tosh while
Pete Roscia and Bobby Duch
will open at safeties.

The Spider defensive line
is anchored by two All-
Southern tackles, Bruce Ka-
sarda and John Barelli, At
ends Richmond will open
with Pat Morris and Tom
Duerr. Russ Croom should
open at middle guard while
the linebacking duties are
left to Jeff Hanson, Larry

soccer team faces the pro-
spect of a dismal season.

The main problem facing
the team will be inexperi-
ence at nearly every posi-
tion. The transfer of players
to other schools and the loss
of several players to the
Junior Year Abroad Pro-
gram have left Coach Harry
Fogleman with a very slim
chance of matching last
year’s 4-7-1 record,

The teams “greatest, loss
will be that of All-South
wing Roger Peterson, who
,elected not to play after re-
turning from. his. year in
France. Peterson said' of his
decision, ‘It takes up too
much time, and I realized
that there are other things
more important. I still en-
joy kicking the ball around,
but I'm not so sure I enjoy
competition."’

Fogleman blamed Peter-
son's year abroad for his
change in attitude. ‘It
seems that the boys who go
to France come back and
don’t want to play, but those

their upset over the Oakland
Raiders. The Bengal front-
office is uncertain whether
he will be kept with the

timore Colts taxf¥squad. Ear-
lier in September Slade had

stored to the taxi squad.

who go to Germany come
back eager to play.”

This season, Steve Cul-
bertson, Charlie Heiner, and
Ed Galloway have gone a-
broad. Heiner’s absence
leaves the team with no
goalie. In addition, Cam Mc-
Nair transferred to Georgia,
Tech, and Ramsey trans-
ferred to Duke. Dick Allison
and Richard Cowart, count-
ed on at fullback, are not re-
turning.

Seniors Mike Taylor, John
Bruner, Jack Caldwell, and
Johnny Robinson, and junior
Brian Tarr are the only ex-
perienced players remaining
on the squad. Coach Fogle-
man’s hopes for a respect-
able season lie the many un-
proven players on the team.
