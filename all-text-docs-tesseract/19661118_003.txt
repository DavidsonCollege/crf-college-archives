Big Cats Inherit Star Role

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor
The. burden of making up
for the absence of Dick
Snyder this year falls upon
the shoulders of 6-9 Rod
Knowles and 6-10 Tom
Youngdale, two of the staff
of Wildcat tri-captains, and

the effectiveness of this
year’s basketeers may well
depend on these two.
“Naturally we hope that they
will carry the offensive load,"
said Coach Lefty. Driesell.
“They will have to score better
and work harder on the boards
this year because we don’t have

“We are also hoping,” contin
ued Driesell, ‘that both will im

they have become more experi
enced. Youngdale guarded cor
ner men for the first time in his
career last year. Knowles should
do a better job this year of pro-
tecting the basket.”

Driesell cited experience as a
major criterion in the impor-
tance of the towering twosome

i this season. He felt that their

starting every game and play
ing close to 40 minutes in each
tilt last season would give them
an edge this year.

Driesell also noted the hard
work Youngdale has put in since
last season. “Tom has. matured

and as a basketball player. He
is probably the most improved

but it’s hard to evaluate so far

An All-State and all-conference

Huckel, Moser Give ’Cats
Spirit, Smoothness, Shots

By CLIFF DUKE

Saturday evening, as the chilling air of dusk settles over a battered gridiron and

rings the curtain down on the Year of the Dirty Thirty, loyal fans will mi
to the cozy confines of Johnston Gymnasium for the first revival of bas-

a

te ex-

ball, ‘Davidson's winter religion. And for a team without seniors and only two re-
ene starters, two sophomores figure t» be chief Defenders of the Faith.

Dave Moser will supplant de-
parted Phil Squier at the vital
point position. As a senior in Ft.
Wayne, Ind., Moser’s 16-point
average and steady ball-handling
paced his team to a 25-5 reeord
and the runner-up slot in the
state tournament. Along the way
he was named All!-C ty, All-State
and MVP ‘n the sectional tourna.
ment. Ta»bed the number-two
player in the state by sportswrit
ers, Moser performed capably
in the annual summer showdown
with Kentucky's All-Staters.

Choos ng Davidson over Indi
ana was ‘‘a real tough decision
because my high school coach
went to Indiana as_ freshman

coach. But Davidson of ered a
better education, and I thought
I'd like the South.” He must
have become acclimated qu‘ck-
ly because he immediately took
charge of the promising Wild-
kittens and engineered them to
a 12-4 record while tallying 16.2
polnts per game and leading the
squad in assists.

But the pressure was nothing
compared to what he will face
this year. One. of the keys to

honest.

Moser's partner outside,
Wayne Huckel, claims, ‘‘Dave is
the best off-balance shooter I've
ever seen. He always hits the
open man. He's poised and
quick, and will take command
as one of our tri-captains.”

Merely to state Huckel's ath
letic abilities comes out like a
lie. In ‘high school at Cranford,
N.J., he played football until his
junior year, then took up soccer
and made the All-County team.
In track he threw the javelin
well enough to place fifth in the
state, and he fooled around with
baseball. In baskefball his 21-
point production as a senior led
his team to county and sectional
championships and earned him
an All-State berth.

‘CATS OVER INDIANS

Huckel chose Davidson over
Dartmouth in order to ‘‘find out
if I could play b'ig-time basket-
ball.”” His first season, in which
he led the Wildkittens in scor-
ing (20.2) and in diving to the
floor to retrieve loose balls, con-
vinced everyone he could.

Huckel is being counted on to
provide an outside threat, but
as a selfless team man, he main-
tains that “if I see someone
open closer to the basket, I'm
going to pass to him.”

HUCKEL A HELP
Moser, his close friend off
court, stated, ‘‘It’s great to have
Wayne beside me. If I gamble
on defense and miss, he'll take
up for me until 1 can recover.
And when you see him hustling
so hard, you decide you've got

to do something yourself."
Coach Lefty Driesell acknowl-
edged the value of the two soph.
omores to the team, saying,
“Both are good athletes and
competitors. Moser will quarter-
back us and give us the first
outside shot we've had at guard,
while Huckel will score and help
Moser harass the other team's

Schoo] in Illinois, Youngdale said
he felt he had improved his co
ordination and strength from
last season and attributed the
improvement to experience. ‘‘A
year of experience means an
awful lot to a varsity basketball
player,” he admitted.

Youngdale remarked that the |

schedule looked tougher than last
year's and that the success of the
‘Cats would depend on whether
they can get together and play
well as a team. “We have a lot
of good individuals,” he said,
“but it will depend on the team
work we can muster up.”

Knowles, a High School All
American, N.C. all-star and
three-time all-conference player
in Greenville, returns with a
sophomore average of 19.4 points
and 9.8 rebounds per game. ‘‘The
biggest improvement on my part
is that I think that I'm driving
more than before,"’ he said

Knowles said that his goal for
the season is for the ‘Cats to
maintain their streak of 20-vic
tory seasons and to take the
Southern Conference crown
*“Maybe if we get lucky and get

a few breaks, we can get into
the NCAA playoffs again,”’ said
Knowles.

Youngdale commented that
Knowles had all the tools to be
come another Davidson basket-
ball star. ‘He is slated to. be an
All-American. I hope he gets

good enough so that he can be
”

one.

Returning the favor, Knowles
lauded Youngdale's improve-
ment. “Tom will be a big factor
in scoring and rebounding this
year. Usually a team does not
have two men big enough to
guard both of us, Also, Tom
draws the bigger man and I us-
ually get the smaller, which
helps me a lot. Tom has really
improved on his ball-handling
and shooting from last year. He
is really looking great.”

Talent, Desire Keynote ‘Kittens

Manned by an impressive
array of talented athletes,
Davidson's Baby Cagers may
prove just as explosive as
the varsity’s Fearsome Five.
The ’Kittens sport a tall,

and marked by depth and

“This freshman team has the

High School All-American Jer-
ry Kroll will man one of the
wing slots. “Kroll is a hard-
nosed defensive player,’ Hol-
land said, “‘and a good shooter
and ball handler. So far he has
developed more than any other
freshman we've ever had.”

Kroll was a unanimous choice
for All-State honors in Texas last
year, and was tapped for All

ties labeled him one of the best
