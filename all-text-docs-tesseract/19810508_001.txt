Faculty supports sex-blind admission:

By MAHMOUD SAYANI
- Staff Writer

The faculty voted 39 to 31
Tuesday to pass a resolution
requesting that the Board of
Trustees establish a merit-
based, sex-blind College admis-
sions policy.

The Trustees established
Davidson’s current 2:1 male/
female admissions ratio in 1976.

‘Philosophy Professor Robert
Maydole, who drafted the pro-
posal last week, said it received
less support than he expected.
This was probably because the
vote came up at the end of the
meeting, after some faculty
members had left, Maydole
said. He added that several
supporters of the proposal were
absent.

Maydole circulated his pro-
posal as a petition last week,

collecting over 60 faculty signa-
tures by Wednesday.

Under the College Constitu-
tion, the faculty must have a
majority vote of its total mem-
bership in order to present a
proposal directly to the Board
of Trustees. Maydole’s proposal
did not receive a majority vote
of the College’s 100-member
faculty.

Maydole said, however, that
Admissions Director John Grif-
fith will ask the Trustees at
their meeting this week to
reevaluate the current admis-
sions policy. If the Trustees
endorse Griffith, the faculty
vote will appear as part of
Griffith’s study, according to
Maydole.

If the Trustees choose not to
initiate a study, the faculty will
present their proposal directly

Old South future unknown

Protest response pleases BSC

By FRANCES PALMER
Assistant News Editor

The Black Students Coalition’s (BSC) protest of the Kappa
Apha (KA) fraternity’s Old South weekend had “good results,”’
according to members of both groups.

Both sides said airing their views helped to increase
commynication and understanding between them. Continuing
to improve BSC and KA relations is ‘‘the most important thing
right now,’’ BSC President Andre Kennebrew said.

The protest began last week when the BSC issued a statement
asking the KA’s to discontinue their annual Old South

to the Board at their fall
meeting.

Maydole said he hopes the
Trustees would re-evaluate
admissions policy ‘‘without
being prodded, without waiting
for the fall.”

The proposal’s faculty op-
ponents felt that ‘‘pragmatic
concerns outweighed the moral
issue’’ and feared ‘‘the College
would become predominantly
female, making it a lesser school
somehow,’’ Maydole said.

French Professor Charles
Dockery said he supported the
proposal because the present
admission policy is ‘‘morally
and ethically wrong.”’

Philosophy Department
Chairman Earl MacCormac,
who supported the proposal,
cited two arguments effectively
used against sex-blind admis-
sions. The first was that David-
son women generally do not win
graduate fellowships. One of the

Key women’s issues face Trustees

By TIM WHALEN

News Editor
The Trustees will discuss the
student body’s 2:1 male/female
admissions ratio and the need
for women’s athletic scholar-
ships in their meeting this

Thursday and Friday.
Admissions Director John

Griffith will ask the Executive
Committee of the Board of
Trustees on Thursday to
authorize a study of the admis-
sions ratio, and Athletic Direc-
tor Gene Bingham will propose
to the Trustee Athletic Com-
mittee that the College grant
basketball scholarships to wo-

men.

Griffith said he decided the
male/female ratio needs study
when he noticed that the num-
ber of female applicants to the
College has been steadily rising
over.the past several years
while the number of male appli-
cants has held ¢ t. Also,

celebration, which traditionally features a Confederate uniform
ball.

The KA’s held Old South off-campus last weekend, according
to previous plans.

Other students, faculty members, and administrators joined
BSC members in the protest by wearing red ribbons.

Kennebrew.said he has mixed emotions about the protest. He
stressed that it was the ‘‘first time black students have decided
to openly protest Old South.”” Kennébrew added that KA’s
decision whether or not to-hold:Old South next year willmeasure
the protest’s degree of success.

KA President Eric Crum said he does not know if the KA’s
will continue the Old South celebration in the future. He said it
is an-annual house decision, but “next year alternatives will
certainly be considered.’’

Kennebrew said he identified three basic reactions among
students to the protest: 1)‘‘You’re right,” 2) ‘“‘Is this some kind
of game to draw attention?,” and 3) ‘‘This is black racism.”

He feels the second response is a reaction to Dr. Charles

Ford saw international approval of Reagan's economic, foreign policy on tour

Ford, who has just completed a world
tour, presented his views on foreign
policy problems facing the new admini-
stration.

He said he detected general support
for President Reagan’s econimic policies
among the foreign leaders he visited. “If
we in the U.S. don’t have a strong
economy most of the nations of the world
will suffer.’’

He also said the leaders generally
supported Reagan’s firm stance toward
the U.S.S.R., though there was uniform
“apprehension in regards to any military
engagement between the superpowers.”

Ford focused on three politically
unstable areas.of the globe: Poland, the
Middle East, and China.

He said he expected the threat of a

Soviet invasion of Poland to remain high

for perhaps several month to come. The

Russians are ‘‘damned if they do and

damned if they don’t,’”’ he added.

“In this instance the Soviet Union
faces a serious dilemma. On one hand
there is a gradual undermining of
Communist Party control. If this con-
tinues, with independent farmer ‘and
worker groups getting stronger, the
Communist party will inevitably lose its
grip.

“If so, it is also inevitable that similar
movements will develop in Czechoslo-

vakia, Rumania, Hungary and, most -

importantly for the Russians, in East

. Germany: Should this movement

spread, the domination of the Soviet

Union in Eastern Europe will come to an

end. This could lead to. an eventual end-
