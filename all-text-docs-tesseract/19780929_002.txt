Davidson is continuing to
plan for a new College Com-
mons, with a location between
Richards and Bailey Houses
foremost in consideration, says
Director of the Physical Plant
Grover Meetze.

The Commons, scheduled for
completion by the beginning of
the 1980-81 academic year, will
be the new eating facility for
freshman and independent up-
perclassmen.

A land. testing firm is now
under contract to the College to
test the feasibility of several
possible locations on or near
Patterson Court. Although se-
veral sites are under considera-
tion, Meetze said that the most
likely plan is to move Richards
and Bailey, whose present func-
tion will be assumed by the
Commons, farther apart and to

build the Commons in the space

left between.

Richards and Bailey, which
would be moved intact a few
feet to either side, would proba-
bly be converted to private
upperclassman eating houses.

Hopefully, this plan would
relieve the overcrowded condi-
tion of existing eating houses,
both freshman and upperclass-

~man. Projected serving capaci-

ty of the College Commons is
six hundred, with room for
future expansion.

Proprietorship of the Com-
mons is very much undeter-
mjned at this point.

Meetze said the College hopes
to have the Commons opera-
tional by September, 1980, a
goal he is confident will be met
barring unforseen difficulties.
This schedule allows three to
four months for site testing and
the obtaining of an architectural
firm.

Architectural planning is ex-
pected to take from eight to ten

Commons planning continues

months, and the actual moving
and building another year.

According to Vice President
for Development Duane Ditt-
man, the College is seeding a
total of two million dollars to
pay for the construction and
endowment of the facility. Esti-
mated costs of planning and
construction are $1,670,000.

$330,000 is being sought as
endowment, part of which will
pay maintenance and other
costs, which Dittman estimated
to be $48,000 a year.

To date, Davidson has ob-
tained $1,200,000 towards
meeting these costs.

The College hopes to raise the
remaining $800,000 during the
course of planning and con-
struction, largely by calling on
individual donors. At least
$200,000 of. this sum must be
obtained by December 31, 1979,
in order to meet the Kresge
Foundation’s deadline for

matching its grant.
