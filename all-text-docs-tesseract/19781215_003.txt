vote in Tuesday’s elections.

MacGill, Brown win,
barely avoid run-off

In the closest thing to a
free-for-all that Quips and
Cranks has. seen in years,
Martha MacGill and Lisa
Brown won. first ballot victory
in their bid for the editorship.

For the last three’ years the
editership- has: gone uncon-
tested. Then, suddenly this
year there were three challen-
gers—two teams and one lone
individual.

“[ didn’t think we were going

to win; I thought it was going
to be a run-off,” MacGill frank-
ly admitted.

The team squeezed out of a

run-off ‘by only 13 votes. The |
final SGA tally gave the win-

ners 400 votes.

The two freshmen in the race,

Diane Odom and Lucy, Phillips,
polled 277, and Hak Kim took
97...

Odom and Phillips, who had
been aiming for a run-off, were
disappointed.

“We put an exceptional a-
mount. of work, thought, and
time into our campaign and we
feel the fact we are freshmen is
the reason we lost," the team
said in a statement released
Wednesday.

Contacted personally , Odom

said, ‘‘It made me _ really
frustrated. I think you should
be elected on the -basia of.

ability, not age. It was really
like on ihe a we were figh-
ting.”

The winning team did-not
comment directly on the fresh-
men’s charge that prejudice was
the deciding factor inthe race,
but Brown said she thought
they won because “We've had

more experience with Davidson, :

not just with the yearbook.”
The freshmen. said .they *in-

freshman section this year. .
“We're. giving our fe

support to Martha and. Lisa and.

we're helping them in every way
possible. We hope. they will.act
in this. position with, the same

- enthusiasm. that we have for

Quips and, Cranks,”’ they said.
As for the winners, ‘MacGill
and Brown said. they. want to
work closely with the present
yearbook: editors; Steve Kline
and Lana Sims, to learn about
the business end of: the paper
and to increase their knowledge
of layout and production. —
Both MacGill and Brown will
also attend a’ two-week summer
workshop on — produc-

s tion.

For some tired fres:
Daviason isn't the place to be

By EDITH PARKER

This year’s freshmen attrition
rate seems to be-running slight-
ly above average, according to
Assistant Dean of Students Sue
Ross.

As of the end of’ the first
term, five of the three hundred
and sixty-one freshmen class
had left Davidson.

Reasons given for the depar-
tures include family-related
problems, financial problems,
academic difficulties or the real-
ization that Davidson was not
the right place for the student
involved.

Dean of Students Will Terry
said he finds this number not
unusual, “‘There is bound to be
an amount of shakedown after
the freshmen arrive. People
expect the wrong things..Some
people become discouraged. aca-
demically even though they
aren’t doing that badly.

Others find it hard to leave
home in general: Still others feel
that Davidson does not have
what. they ‘heed. One of: this
year’s freshmen left because he
wanted to be veternarian and he
felt he couldn’t. get the courses
he needed at Davidson."

A roommate of a dropout
seemed to.support Terry's com-
ments: ‘‘My- roommate missed
home .a lot and was having a
hard time making an adjust-

ment to cgilege. He felt he
would be happier somewhere
closer to home.”

triplés. None of the dropouts

. came from the triples, but there
still seems to be a dissatis-. .

faction with triples,
According to’Student Hous-
ing Director Scotty Nicholls,
three of the triples have made
changes with either one of the
three persons moving out into
another room or one of the three
persons switching places with
‘another student on their hall.
When asked if triples would be
around next year, Nicholls re-
plied, ‘‘As far as I know they
will.”

However some strong oppo-
sition to triples seems to be
mounting.

Barbara Ballard of the Coun-
seling Center seems:to best sum
up thé pésitidn of ‘those ‘strong:
ly opposed to triples’ Mrs.

Ballard has worked with several .

occupants of triples either indi-
vidually or as a group. Basically
she feels the difficulties fresh-
men face are magnified by being
in a triple.

Mrs. Ballard said, *‘Most
freshmen focus on their room-

because of government regula-
tions.”

Piedmont Branch Manager
Don Howie felt that much of the
student concern was caused by

a misunderstanding of last Fri-
-day’s-letter. .

“It is mot an increase from

complicated average balance,

ty that NOW accounts may

Carolina:

paying interest on checking
