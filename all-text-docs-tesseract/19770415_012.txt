After all these

Undoubtedly#all Davidson stu-

idea of giving in to their frustrations
and leaving school for awhile to
experience ‘‘the real world’’. The

Bill Hearn, currently working on a
sociology degree at Davidson, took
time off during his college career—
eight years of it. Hearn originally
came to Davidson as a freshman in
the fall of 1965 and stayed for two and
a half years until he dropped out in
January of 1968 (interrupted by a
semester back at Davidson in fall ’74).
Between his decision to leave school
in 1968 and his return to campus this
March, Hearn spent time in various
corners of the world engaged in the
following activities:
—working in a factory in Newton,
N.C, .
—teaching adult and driver’s educa-
tion as a VISTA volunteer on an
Indian reservation in Montana
—studying in the Netherlands
—“kibbutzing”’ in Israel
—traveling across Asia from the
Middle East as far as Malaysia
—working for a food stamp program
in Philadelphia
—working as a farm laborer in Oregon
—delivering mail in Pittsburgh
—working at Sheldon Jackson Col-
lege in Sitka, Alaska :
—managing adult bookstores in
Charlotte, Washington and Baltimore
—delivering mail in Fairbanks, Ala-
ska
—working as a volunteer journalist
for a newspaper in Nome, Alaska
From his position, Hearn has a
clearer view of the transitions that
Davidson has undergone since the
radical days of the '60’s. He feels that
there have been no substantive or
fundamental changes in the orienta-
tion of Davidson College since his
departure in 1968. But even if funda-
mental changes have not occurred
here since 1968, there have certainly

been a multitude of secondary or.

peripheral changes since then. Hearn
elaborates frelly on some of these
differences.

Fraternities were in their heyday
here while he was at Davidson with
approximately 70 percent of the
student body participating in the
system. “‘There was zero social life for
the independents,’’ he commented. ‘‘I

In addition to this, in 1967 a group of
Davidson students, including Hearn,
went to Washington to take part in
the famous Pentagon protest of that
year. “‘About the most radical thing
that happened around here was when
my fraternity pledged a black guy,”’
Hearn recalls.

Also during this period, Hearn

MARCHERS’ MARKER

Pacifist Bill Hearne on the Pentagon grounds

The advent of co-education has
been a definite plus for Davidson,
Hearn contends, who recalls that
during his years here students often
went ridiculous distances to even get

‘blind dates. ‘‘Having girls in the

student body is a good idea which
should. normalize male/female rela-
tionships.” f

Two years of ROTC were required
of all students while Hearn was here.
“At first I had no strong feelings on
the matter,’’ he asserts, ‘‘but I
gradually came to view it as a nui-
sance as did a lot of students. A good
number, however, went on to ad-
vanced ROTC because they wanted to
go into the military as officers instead
of as privates.”

Compared to the protest activity
which occurred on many other college
campuses, “‘not too much went on”’ at
Davidson, Hearn explains. ‘‘Around
1966, an attempt was made to esta-
blish an SDS chapter on campus, but

sonality turns a prosperous country
into “‘a vast realm of nightmare.”’
In doing so he sells the nation’s

territorial waters to the Americans, -

who cart them away in numbered
pieces, and works out an infallible
way to win the national lottery time
and time again. He canonizes his
mother by decree and a palace full of
lepers, singing birds, and cows that
eat velvet.

At that time, chapel attendance
was mandatory. Students had the
option of fulfilling this requirement at
any church they wished, but ‘‘most
people went to DCPC.’’ Despite the
presence of some ‘“‘protest’’ activities
on campus, ‘‘the religious atmosphere
didn’t tend towards pacifism. In that
area, the general attitude seemed to
be more of the basic ‘hypocritical
Protestant’ viewpoint,’’ Hearn com-
mented.

Big weekends such as Homecoming
and Spring Frolics haven't changed
very much since 1968, Hearn believes.
“There was usually a big-name mus-
ical group each of these weekends.
For example, while I was here we had
The Association and Spanky and
Our Gang. Beyond these big events,
the big weekends were dominated by
the Patterson Court fraternities, even

though fines were assessed if any of
the houses were caught with beer at a
party or with girls in the wrong places
at the wrong times.

For beer drinking in general, ‘‘we
usually went up the road to The
Anchor Tavern or Hattie’s.”’

1965 through 1968 were some of the
premier years for Davidson basket-
ball. Hearn recalls ‘‘very little dis-
sent’’ against the amount of funds
appropriated for the program. Just
before his arrival at Davidson, Homer
Smith was hired as football coach in
an effort to revitalize that program,
which resulted in a small controversy.
“The issue was whether the college
should make large financial commit-
ments to both sports instead of just
emphasizing basketball,’’ Hearn elab-
orated.

When Hearn first came to David-
son, he was a self-described ‘‘long-
hair from the North’’, but found a
very tolerant atmosphere. ‘‘I wasn’t
‘persecuted’ at all, but was accepted
right away,’’ Hearn explains. Along
these same lines, he found that ‘‘rela-
tions were pretty good’’ with towns-
people, especially blacks. ‘‘I was very
impressed with the ease with which |
was able to strike up relationships
with some of the janitors and black
employees. It was a sort of interracial
human contact which I rarely found in
the North.”

Hearn has many humorous remin-

iscences from his early years = a
idson. “I distinctly remember Bé€ing
escorted out of the Union by Shaw
Smith for entering the building bare-
foot,’’ he chuckles.
_Some things about Davidson seem
to be universal regardless of the time
period. Hearn explains, ‘‘Atti-
tudes about this place are still up to
the individual. You can make of your
‘Davidson Experience’ pretty much »
whatever you want to make of it.”

Hearn’s ramblings have made him
a strong advocate of ‘‘time off’’for
students. He is especially impressed
with Ken Wood’s work in Experien-
tial Programs, something that was
not offered during his time at David-
son. ‘‘When I decided to leave in
1968, the only position the placement
office could come up with for me was
to work as a campus policeman at
Wayne State in Detroit,’’ Hearn
laughs.

Hearn’s plans for the future? ‘‘I
need only more term in order to
graduate,’”’ he indicated, ‘‘but after
this term I’ll probably go back to
Alaska and after I’ve made some
money come back and finish up here.”’

tude. All time, to him, is one
immediacy, illimitable and chronicled
forever and irrevocably. It is this
which makes The Autumn of the
Patriarch so difficult and so int-
riguing. For chronological detail is
lost in the lake of time into which he
throws his dictator and what is left is
a vague but persistent sense of
eternity.

In Spanish, the novel is definitely a
Colombian work using slang and
dialect specifically characteristic of
the region surrounding Cartagena.
Rabassa’s translation is occasionally
flat but nevertheless: evokes the

original, anjeternity which, unlike the
