A Greater Davidson
Is Being Planned

Cut Shows the Proposed Improve-
ments and Changes.

The above cut shows the general plan
of improvement which is being followed
in developing the Davidson campus.

“Mr. John Nolen, of Cambridge, Mass..

made a very thurough study of the pos-
sibilities of the campus and it will be
seen that when all the proposed improve-
ments are finished. there will be several
important changes.

Already water mains are being placed
for the new buildings, and if the $100,-

000 additional endowment is added this}

spring, as is confidently expected, the
new alumni gymnasium will be erected
on the campus, between Chambers Build-
ing and Sprunt Athletic Field.

CLASS IN EXPRESSION

ORGANIZED HERE-

A considerable amount ot interest has
been aroused on the campus in a class in
expression, taught by Prof. G. S. Ful-
bright, of the Boston School of Expres-
sion. Professor Fulbright has just come
from Columbia Theological Seminary,
where he has been giving a series of les-
sons similar to the course that he has
begun here. The object in view is the
accurate and effective expression of men-
tal activity in both voice and bodv.
Mechanical rules are avoided and the
natural development of the individual is
the key-note. Two classes meet daily,
and the course will continue for four
weeks. At present about twenty-five
have enrolled. and all are. enthusiastic
over the prospect.

Musical Organizations —
Have Successful Trip

Orchestra and Glee Club Give Four
Concerts.

On Monday, April toth, the David
son College Orchestra and Glee Club
left on the second trip of the spring with
a personnel of cighteen ren. “They ap-
peared at Queens College that night in
a very good performance. Next after-
noon, in Bennettsville, S.C... the music-
ians were given a most delightful lawn
party by Mrs. Carroll, consequently the
club “came back” that night with a con-
cert above the average.

Their next appearance was on the
stage of the Fayetteville High School.
one of the finest school buildings in the
state. This was the scene of the greatest
hit of the trip when J. L. Fowle sane
“No John No.” After the concert the
Orchestra and Glee Club were most
delightfully entertained at the liome of
Rev. Watson Fairley, pastor of the First
Presbyterian church.

The next point on the trip was Red
Springs. which was reached after a stren-
uous ride in Fords, because of a train
wreck. The largest and most appreci-
ative audience of the trip greeted them
here. The reception given after the con-
cert by the Juniors and Seniors of the
college was highly enjoved by all, Taken
as a whole the trip was a very successful
one.

The members of the Civic League re-
siding on South Main street are plant-
ing flower beds at the point where Acad-
emy street separates from Main. The
unsightly billboard at the station has
been replaced by a wire fence, on which
vines will be planted.

Emory Wins In Second

First Games of Season| Debate With Davidson

Winning Streak Broken by A. & M.
One Victory.

A. & M. GAME.
In a slow and loosely played game

Davidson was defeated by A. & M.
Tuesday, the arith, at Gastonia, by a
score of 11 to 7.. It was a very long
drawn out affair, darkness nearly ‘stop-
ping it before the nine innings were fin-
ished. Errors were largely, if not en-
tirely, responsible for Davidson's defeat.
The whole Davidson infield) made at
least one misplay, which paved the ways
for as many runs.

Hengeveld was in the box for Dav-
idson and pitched good ball throughout
the game despite the lack of support: by
his team-mates. vans was Coach Cor-
rell’s choice as a slab artist. and for six
innings was almost invincible, but in the
seventh and cighth the Red and Black

, started a belated rally, and scored four

runs, driving him from the box. Weath-
ers, who replaced him, was able ta stop
the rally without further damage. John-
son was the star for the locals with the
hat, getting a triple and two singles out
of five attempts. Black also hit) well.
getting two hits out of three trips to the
plate. The batting of Winston and
Sullivan featured for A. & M.

FIRST TRINITY GAME,

The team suffered its second defeat
Thursday at Hickory, when ‘Vrinity
won a fast and exciting game by a score
of 4 to 2. The game was a pitcher's
battle between Lawson and Earnhardt.
with honors in favor of the latter.) He
allowed but three hits.

‘The decided feature of the game came
in the second inning. Saunders, firs’

man up, walked. and then McMillan)

connected with a fast one, and completed
the circuit before the opposing fielders
could find the ball. Both teams fielded
in fine style, except for the two errors
made by the locals in the early part of
the game. Flythe was the particular
star for Trinity, getting two hits and
making a sensational one-handed catch
of Black’s long fly.
SECOND TRINITY GAME.

Davidson took a slugging match from
Trinity College here last Friday by the
score of 18 to.10. Shaw started for
Davidson, and after one bad inning, set-
tled down and pitched good ball in the
second. However, with ‘Trinity holding
a 3 to t lead over Davidson, he was re-
placed by Hengeveld in the third. ‘Prin-
ity exhausted her supply of twirlers in a
vain effort to stem the tide of Davidson
tallies, but to no avail. A total of fifteen
hits were registered hy the Jocals; nine
by Trinity. The visitors plaved a very
ragged fielding game, and this contrib-
uted largely to Davidson’s run-getting.
Long hits abounded. In the ninth, Gra-
ham .and Flythe each got three-baggers
for Trinitv. Brown got a triple, and
Johnsen, Hengeveld and Alford doubles
for Davidson. Hengeveld stole two
bases, as did McMillan. The tall center
fielder played a stellar game, accepting
six chances faultlessly.

Large Audience Hears Contest at
Agnes Scott.

Stressing the argument that the Eng-
lish government Hoth in theory and in.
fact is from the king and lords down to
the people while the American system is
from the people up, Emory won the
negative of the question: ‘Resolved,
That the British System of Government
is more Democratic than that of the
United States,” in’ the second debate
with Davidson, held at Agnes Scott Col-
lege last Monday evening, April 17th.

Both teams were in’ good form and
drew forth frequent applause from the
large audience which crowded the audi-
torium,

J. G. PATTON

Patton opened the debate for the
affirmative, calling attention to the fact
that the question should be considered
only in the light of pure democracy, and
stressing the fact that the point at issue
was not which form is the best, but
which most ncarly expresses the will of
the majority of the people. He outlined
that the affirmative proposed to shaw
that the British. government is more
democratic than that of — the United
States in all three branches, the legisla-
tive, the executive and the judicial.

He then quoted from such authorities
as Mill, Ogg and Woodrow Wilson to
show that the ballot: in’ England is less
restricted than in the United States.
He then demonstrated that Congress,
after being disproportionately elected,
conducts its business through committees
which deliberate behind closed doors and
which are accountable to no one.

F. Ht. SMITH

F. H. Smith, the second speaker on
the affirmative, argued that in the execu
tive and judicial branches of the gov-
ernment, the British are more demo-
cratic. He quoted Bagehot, the eminent
political economist, who says that the
English King has only the “right to be
