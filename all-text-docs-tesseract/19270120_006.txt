Often, in trying to bring on big speak-
ers and leaders from the outside world,
we overlook men of power and ability
who live right here with us.

ing message, so the speaker for “Y” serv-
ices on Sunday, January 23rd, will be
Prof. J. C. Baily, of the Davidson faculty,
connected with the Greek and Bible de-
partments. Prof. Bailey was an honor

He is a leading figure in local O. D. K.
circles, having been taken into this order
during the spring term of his Junior
year. Both in class and student affairs
at large he has taken an active part, hav-
ing been honored by his class mates and

The second hole will be used as the}
first hole, the tee being placed near the|
woods by the Freshman Athletic Field.

Under the new order the golf course
will contain two fairly long holes and two
others of moderate length. Within a
few weeks time the greens on the other
holes will be improved for the spring
season. The sheep are still keeping
the grass cropped. New bunkers will
probably be installed on several holes.

Golf has proved to be one of the most
popular sports among the Davidson stu-
dents. At least one third of the stu-

best we’ve ever had!

The officers take pride in'the fact that
they have-bokoed four big pictures which
are well known and recommended as the
finest photo-plays of the year, but at
the same time they feel that they have
taken quite a risk in engaging these
rather expensive productions and unless
the whole student body co-operates and
helps the Y by attending, a financial loss
will be incurred. So the Y takes this
means of asking your help in this mat-
ter, knowing that both you and they will
feel well repaid in the proposition.

To all men who make a
hobby of pipes

Maysz you've spent half your life and
fortune on this old hobby—collecting
everything from peace-pipes down to the
latest “L and Maria” underslung. Maybe
you know the pipe encyclopedia from
amber Americanus to Zula zuago.

But if you're a pipe smoker, you learned .
long ago that no matter how much a
man may know about trick pipes and
pipe tricks what he gets out of any pipe
depends on what he puts in it.

And if you know your tobaccos, you
know that any pipe’s a sweeter smoke
when packed with grand and glorious
old Granger Rough Cut... The finest
Burley that grows, mellowed Wellman’s
way and specially cut for pipes. . .

A man may have a hundred pipes but
he needs only one tobacco... and that’s
Granger. For whether you put it in a
meerschaum or a corn-cob, Granger is al-
ways the same cool, sweet tobacco...
worthy of any pipe in the world.

~GRANGE
ROUGH CUT

The half-pound vac-
uum tin is forty-five
cents, the foil-pouch
package, sealed in
glassine, is ten cents.

}_ Granger Rough Cut is made by the Liggett €& Myers Tobacco Company
