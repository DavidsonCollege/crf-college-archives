1987 program

inadequate

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

The 1987 Program, David-
son's $35 million fund-raising
drive may be keeping pace with
its original goals, but these will
not get the college very far.

Vice President for Develop-
ment Duane Dittman said the
program is “about on target.”
However, since 1976, when the
program began, inflation has
drastically reduced the real
value of the $35 million goal.
Construction costs alone have
gone up 15% annually, while
book prices have doubled. By
1987, Dittman said, ‘‘we would
estimate that we’ll need 45

- million.”

Dittman said there will be no
change in projects because of
inflation. “The college has said
what its needs are,’’ he ex-
plained, and reducing these
needs would be ‘‘admitting
defeat.”

If the goals of the 1987
Program are to be met, the price
tag must go up.

However, there will be no
change in the fundraising goal,
Dittman said. ‘‘We have de-
cided at least for the time being
to stay with $35 million for
identification purposes. It’s un-
stable to change your goal every
year.”

Any decision to raise the goal
would come later on in the
program, Dittman said. If the
$35 million mark would be
reached by 1984 or 1985, there
could be an extra effort made to
raise another. $10 million.

Dittman did not have specific
strategies for raising this addi-
tional money so quickly. He
admitted that the higher goal

Steam, heat, and money seep out

The College Physical Plant is
making strides toward a more
efficient heating and cooling
system in the dorms and class-
room -buildings.

According to Physical Plant
Director Grover Meetze, the
College is faced with two major
problems: how to conserve ener-
gy and how to build up energy
in the event of a major fuel
sho ‘

tas conservation is diffi-
cult. The dorms and classroom
buildings are heated from a
central steam plant, but the
steam lines are old, and steam is
escaping everywhere, Meetze
said. He added that to improve
these steam lines would be a
very expensive endeavor.

Because the steam enters the
buildings on the basement level,

Safety phones, extinguishers defunct

“Student irresponsibility has effectively shut down all emergen-
cy systems in the dorms,” according to Housing Director Bill
Bolding.

Bolding said that all emergency phones, fire alarm bells, and
many fire extinguishers have been out of order for some time.

“The emergency phones were cut off by the Davidson Town
Police recently as a result of continuous false alarms. The alarm
bells in Belk were literally ripped off the wall by someone who
panicked after pulling one of the alarms,” he said.

Fire extinguishers were “our worst problem because they’re
always sitting out in the open. We are continually having to send
the extinguishers off-campus to be refilled, leaving fire protection
the extinguishers off-campus to be refilled, leaving no fire
protection handy in the dorms,” Bolding said.

According to Dean of Students Will Terry, ‘‘We are not going to
tolerate this condition any further.” Terry added that tampering
with fire safety equipment is not only a violation of the school’s
Code of Responsibility, but also of state law.

the first few floors are heated
excessively merely to get heat
to the top floors, Meetze said.
This tends to cause an inordi-
nate imbalance in temperature.
Little Dorm, for example, has
been victim to the College’s
inefficient heating system. The
basement stairwell registered a
whopping 115 degrees F during
a study earlier this week. The
heat within rooms on the first
floor was found to be 93 degrees
near the heaters and 82 degrees
by the doors. The outside
temperature was 46 degrees.

SGA prepares trial faculty
evaluation for this term

By ROB SINGLETON
Staff Correspondent
The SGA voted last week to conduct a trial student evaluation of

faculty at-the end of this term.

The SGA will give SIR evaluation forms to all willing professors,
according to SGA President John Jackson. Seventy-five percent of
the faculty have agreed to cooperate.

The SGA initiative reflects student frustration over the faculty’s
repeated rejections of specific evaluation forms Jackson said. “we
are weary of the procrastination on this issue,” Jackson wrote in a

letter to the faculty.

The Code of Faculty Evalua-
tion Procedures mandates that
there be some form of universal
evaluation system to be used by
the administration. Jackson
feels most professors favor
some type of evaluation and
explained their failure to imple-
ment one, saying, “‘...it’s just
tough to pin them down on
what the form should be.”

Jackson hopes SGA pressure
will get the faculty to agree
upon a. specific form at their
March 11 meeting. Such a form
would be subject to administra-
tion approval.

The SGA will keep their
results confidential: except for
showing individual results to

Jackson said standardized
forms are necessary because
they permit objective, efficient
polling of students. Also, such
forms make the administra-
tion’s evaluation of professors
less nebulous, which is impor-
tant because “the administra-
tion is repeatedly criticized for
its arbitrary evaluation me-
thods,” Jackson wrote.

“Vhe faculty rejected the
standardized ICES form fall
term

Jackson and the SGA feel
strongly enough about the need
for some universal evaluation
form that they are “ready to
take it on as a purely student
run institution if necessary.”

Freshmen will receive the
results of eating house self-se-
lection next Tuesday, February
19, according to Patterson
Court Council subcommittee’
chairman Ann Clark.

The committee will distribute
forms Friday on which fresh-
men will specify their first,
second, and third eating house
choices. The forms will be
collected Monday evening and
eating house assignments
posted Tuesday night.

Clark said she does not know
the exact number of places in
each house because some upper-
classmen, such as those con-
sidering going abroad next
year, have not decided their
eating house plans.

Freshmen will know the num-
ber of available spaces before
next week, Clark said.

Because of the overcrowding
problem, ‘eating houses have
been asked to go up to their.
maximum membership,” Clark
