Linden stirs rep

By EMILY MASON
‘Staff Writer

Can Davidson afford to
maintain its present tenure
policy which is based on
religious requirement?

Fact 1: Bruee Kuklick, Pro-
fessor of History at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and
Editor of The American Quar-
terly, withdrew his offer to
speak at the American Studies
Workshop scheduled to con-
vene at Davidson in June.

This workshop was organ-
ized through the college’s
Honors Center for American
Studies specialists both on the
Davidson faculty and visiting
from outside universities, said
Robert L. Avinger, Jr., Asso-
ciate Professor of Economics
and’Dean of the Center for
Honors Studies.

In his letter to Avinger,
Kuklick explained that he felt
compelled to withdraw his
agreement to speak at the
workshop because he finds
Davidson’s current tenure pol-
icy ‘repellent’. Kuklick later
added, however, that he will

participate in the workshop as

originally planned if David-
son’s current tenure policy is
moderated or removed.
2: Professor. John
Hague, Director of the Nat-
ional American Studies Fac-
ulty, had agreed to contribute
to the workshop both as a
speaker and as a financier.
Hague has subsequently
threatened to rescind both
offers if Davidson’s tenure
policy remains wuchanged.
Fact 3: The Honors Center
had received a “general offer’’
from the National American
Studies Faculty (NASF) tow-
ard the “‘travel and per diem
expenses for visiting scholars”’
involved in the workshop,
according to Avinger.
However, the Linden case
has generated ‘‘considerable

’ Fact 4: Gordon E. Michael-
son, Instructor of Religion,

received indications from

“outside academic contacts”

advising him that ‘‘the kind of

publicity the Linden case has
generated”’ could be detrimen-
tal to Michaelson’s profession-
al interests.

Michaelson noted that his
graduate adviser at Princeton
was Malcolm L. Diamond, a
noted Jewish scholar.

When interviewed, Michael-
son emphasized that his per-
sonal career is ‘‘hardly number

one at this point.” Rather, he’
continued, ‘‘my first point of |

alarm is the reputation of the
college. ”

_ Michaelson is concerned
with the damaging effect that
the Linden case will have on
Davidson’s academic stand-

Fact 5: Nationwide publi-
city of Davidson’s tenure pol-
icy and Linden case includes
an article in the most recent
issue of the Chronicle of
Higher Education.

The Chronicle is a national
magazine which is very widely
read among professionals. As
such, knowledge of David:
son’s tenure policy is available
to all those seeking teaching
positions.

Fact 6: The Princeton Eco-
nomic Department recéently
expressed its disapproval with
Davidson’s tenure policy and
its fear of the limiting effect
that this policy may have on
the college’s graduates.

Fact 7: A-Davidson stu- —

dent recently submitted a
paper he had written to a

INC.

journal for sblication. When

phoned, the journal said that

they would have to wait and

see what Davidson des with

When Jesus said, ‘‘Not
veryone who says to me
rd, Lord,” shall enter the
of heaven,” (Matt.
:21) he proleptically coun-
the inclination of idivi-

als, churches, and institu-
ions to sevure their Christian

Concerning the issue before’
, it is important first of all to
tablish the theological point
hat Christian faith is more a
tter of action, than words,
ore a matter of inclusion
han exclusion, more a matter‘
f saying ‘‘yes,” than saying
“no.” (II Cor. 1:19)
Discipleship means recog-
izing that Jesus has ‘“‘other
sheep” not of our fold, (John
10:16) that he himself has
‘‘broken down the dividing
wall of hostility,”” (Eph. 2:14)
land that , far from “rejecting
his people” (the Jews), he
includes them, together with
“the full number of Gentiles”
(non-believers generally), in
his kingdom. (Romans 11:1,
25, 26)
The present policy which
[has effectively excluded non-
Christians from the Davidson
aculty is therefore objection-
ble on theological. grounds. It
arates those whom Christ
ould unite. It trusts words
ore than actions. It restricts
here Christ would make us

In a fundamental way it
enies the faith it would
rotect by seeking protection
hrough law rather than grace.
For a ‘‘Church-related,”’
‘IChristian,’’ college such theo-
gical issues ought to control
he discussion. Unfortunately
hey do not. Therefore, other
guments may be advanced.
The present policy is also
bjectinoable on moral
rounds. It unjustly denies
mployment to many whose
qualifications and commit-
ents would increase the ef-

- Hfectiveness of Davidson as a

hurch-related college. It
nds to bind the consciences
f candidates and non-tenured
faculty. It tempts some to
bstitute conformity for com-
tment, and others to resist
mmitment less it be inter-
preted as conformity.

The present policy is object-
tionable on academic grounds.
It ‘directly contradicts the
claim of our Statement of
_ | Purpose that Davidson would

‘‘set no limits to the adven-
tures of the mind.’’ We appear
unwilling to tolerate resident
,Jand continuing perceptions of

Fact 8: In connection with
the Linden case, the American.
Association of University: Pro-_
fessors is examining David-,
son’s policy of religious re-_

ents Sor tenure. .

Such theological, moral,
and academic arguments are
not new. They can be found in
the report of the President’s
Commission on Church Rela-
tion of 1969. They were reas-
serted in the faculty when it
called for an end to this policy

in 1972.

Furthermore, in the history.
of this debate the warning has

that if our principles will not
persuade us to change this
policy, practical necessity will.
The inevitable conflict bet-
ween this mistaken policy and
the rules of government and
higher education has now
come to pass.

State and federal agencies
are reviewing our eligibility for
public funds in the light of our
hiring policies, and the Politi-
cal Science Society, the
AAUP, and Phi Beta Kappa
are investigating our actions
to see if there are grounds for
censure. :

Therefore we have to recog-
nize that this policy has
become impossible because of
the danger it presents to the
reputation of the college, its
faculty, and its students.
Some may believe that the
present advetse publicity was
generated by protests within
the college itself. But is is
surely naive to believe that
Mr.Linden and his colleagues
at Princeton would not have,
and have not, alerted the
public press to this incident.

In fact, the acknowledge-
ment of protest within the
college has been the only
positive note in otherwise
uniformly disastrous pub-
licity. Can anyone seriously
imagine that charges of reli-
gious prejudice and anti-
semitism, however unjust, in
The Washington Post, The
New York Times, and public
media all across the country
have not damaged our reputa-
tion?

Can anyone doubt that this
will hurt our recruitment of
fine students— students whose
families are sensitive to these
issues? Can we now expect to
attract the best faculty candi-
dates from such traditional
suppliers as Princeton Univer-
sity? Should we be surprised
that a lecturer from a great
university has just canceled
his engagement at Davidson,
or that a young and gifted
faculty member has been
urged by his graduate school
to seek vm pipnytient else-
where?

Should we not have ex-
pected the calls many of us
have had’ from colleaques
protesting this policy as well

as out apparent willingness to

tle

unjust and unfair it may be,
should we really be astonished
that in the last week the
publication of a student article
has been withheld, or that an
important graduate school has

indicated that Davidson grad-
uates will not be weteones in

the future ee

Can Davidson afford to
stubbornly cling to a wrong-
headed policy when reaction to
that policy may result in a

students’ applications to

things about him were plain as

impressions one hair.

I cannot fault his Scripture,
surprising as it is to encounter
proof-texts from so modern a

same sentence not to adnit

and our Lord makes no bones
about prohibiting us the

Now the Pharisees are not
confined to the rigidly right-

secular humanists, who have
an orthodoxy that makes the
Athanasian Creed sound like
the Bill of Rights. They are in
the saddle andthey ride the
universities and the learned
