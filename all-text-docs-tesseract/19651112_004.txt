SCHEDULING

Rumors are about lately that Davidson football
is going bigtime—schedule-wise—in the near future.
Latest story is that Duke is on the schedule for 1971.
Asked if this were true, Head Coach Homer Smith
could only offer a non-committal, “1 wish it were.

The mentor then went on to explain his ideas
about scheduling and what has been done, in this
line, to improve Davidson’s stature in the football

world.

It all revolves around competition in the South-
ern Conference, an already frequently-mentioned
point.

“We can't compete successfully in this confer-
ence as long as we're a minor school and all the
others are major schools,” states Smith. To be
listed a major school (NCAA, University Division)
a team must have a majority of its schedule com-
prised of major schools. This year only four of our
opponents. The Citadel. William and Mary, VMI and
George Washington, meet these qualifications, so
Davidson is classified a minor school (NCAA, Col-
lege Division). The situation is not yet settled for
next. year, but in 1967 and all years afterward the
team will have achieved major college status.

Smith’s main objective is to win the Southern
Conference. But, in so doing he doesn’t intend
that anyone will be able to claim it was done with
a skimpy conference schedule. That's why West
Virginia is on the docket in 1967. “We just don’t
want to pass over anybody,” he said.

VMI and William and Mary are more natural op-
onents. “We'd like to play them every year, al-
owed the coach. Furthermore, East Carolina, an-
other conference foe, will be added to the schedule

next year.

The coach went on, “To get the men we need to
compete with these teams, we're going to have to
lay some teams that are way out of our class.
fn other words, to attract the top recruits, Davidson
must show these boys it intends to play major col-
lege football. For this reason Smith hopes to sched-

ule for next year a strong major college team.

Although displaying his usual persistence with
reference to improving Davidson’s schedule, the
coach was quick to point out that this is within the
realm of opponents that offer natural rivalries for
Davidson. A major consideration is the entrance re-
quirements of opposing schools. Two present rivals
that meet these standards are Lafayette and Buck-

nell. Both are small schools and have programs
“similar to ours.” Also, Lafayette is a church,
school.

Finally, there’s the question of the Ivy League.
Suffice it to say that‘one representative of that group,
Colgate, is already on a future schedule. Maybe
more will be added someday.

It may be some time before the Wildcats line
up against Army, or Georgia Tech or Auburn, as
in the distant past, but much progress has already
been made in buoying up Davidson’s foundering
football program. Look for much more in the near

future.

MORE ON THE TOE

Ever since they widened the goal posts back in
1958, college football has been a different game.
A fellow named Ed Dyas, who kicked for Auburn,
was the talk of the nation that year. Before those
times a kicking specialist was just about unheard of.
For instance, Dick Cristy’s famous after-the-gun
field goal that beat South Carolina and won the
1957 ACC title ‘for State was the first the flashy
halfback had ever attempted.

Today field goals are short work, and kick-
ing specialists are about as abundant as managers.
The odd thing is how one of the best happened to
land here at Davidson.

One thing for sure, Jim Terry is one of the
best. Coach Smith calls him “one of the four or
five best kickers in the country.” Ample evidence
of this is his record of 31 straight successful extra
point conversions.

Long strings seem to have a way of protecting
themselves. Smith relates that the ball for one of
Terry’s points-after in the Lehigh game was not
even on the tee when he hit it. Holder Jimmy
Poole still had one end of the ball in his right hand
when Terry put the toe to it.

Though he has already broken the Southern
Conference consecutive-extra-point record, Terry
has little chance at the national record. Charlie
Gogolak, who kicks soccer-style for the rampaging
Princeton Tigers, has 44 and still has two games
eft.

But it’s not the record that matters anyway,
according to Smith. People should watch Terry,
not to see a record set, but “just for the pleasure
of watching a superb athlete perform.”

Terry could probably perform for many more
ears. His coach sees him as a sure bet to succeed
the pros if he wanted to, and goes on to say, “Jim
could earn a living kicking professionally until he’s
40 years old.”

THE RECORD

In 1924 and 1926 Davidson won seven games.
That’s the most a Davidson team has won. In
‘26 they shut out Duke, Carolina and State and tied
Wake Forest to win the mythical state championship.
That’s the only championship they’ve ever won.

The ’Cats can win seven again this year if they
take the Jast three. I'll take a chance and perdict
that they do.

They've equaled another record this year: most
Southern Conference victories in one season—two.
Two isn’t enough and all the 7-3’s in the world
won’t obscure that fact.

A Conference success is the only real key to
over-all success. But that record probably won't
last much longer, anyhow. And meanwhile, a 7-3
will do for a starter.

not when he entered the game,
but when. as Poole stated, ‘I
heard one of their linemen say,
‘Watch the fake.’ That made
it pretty bad. I didn’t have too
much confidence.’

“I think the most outstand-
ing point.’ related Coach Smith,
“was the big zero under ‘had
intercepted.’ As a matter of
fact, he had Ken Kendall yell-
ing to him when he was open,
which was an awful lot.”

A source of quite a bit of spec-
ulation {is Poole’s stance, in
which he barely appears over
the center. Poole explains that
he employs a low stance only
when Walter Green centers be-
cause “Walter's so low that you
have to get down low to get your
hands fat up under him.”

It is with a sense of great
satisfaction that followers of
Davidson football view Poole’s
progress. The main way he has
improved, perhaps, is that he
has recovered his strength after
being sick last year. He has

arm, and now it is paying off.

On Poole’s improvement,
Coach Smith feels that “Jimmy
improves with every practice.
He has improved through his
own effort and patience. Every-
thing requires patience to im-
prove.”

in practice. In hot competition

4’Cats Travel To Lafayette;
Leopards’ Den

Tomorrow’s game with Lafayette at Easton. Pa., may provide a few surprises for
the ’Cats. Last year Davidson walloped Lafayette 31-12, but this season the Leopards

_ pose a real threat.

**Lafayette has one of the most
improved teams I have ever
seen,”’ commented Coach Homer
Smith. “Last year they won
no games, but this season the
Leopards have downed Colum-

’y bia, Bucknell and Rutgers."

This season Lafayette boasts a
whole new squad. The starting
lineup contains eleven . sopho-
mores and only two seniors.
Most Eastern papers rate La-
fayette above Lehigh. Recently
Lafayette Coach Kenneth Bunn
called his football team, ‘‘the
best group of athletes ever as-
sembled at Lafayette.”

Leading the Leopards’ attack
will be quarterback Gary Mar-
shall, a 175 pound junior from
Binghamton, New York. As a
sub last seasun, Marshal] hit his
receiver 36 times in 73 attempts
for a total of 325 yards.

Manning the backfield slots
on offense will be sophomores
Bill Messick, Chris Yanegar and
Joel Crossrow. ‘As freshmen the
trio gained more yards rushing
in four games than the entire
varsity did in nine.

A fine group of ends is the
strong point of the Lafayette
line. Juniors Dave Brown and
Gabe Washo hold down the start-
ing positions. Last year Brown
was the team's leading pass re-
ceiver, hauling down 35 tosses
for 468 yards.

The interior line is Lafayette's
weakness. Tom Rosenberg, 220

pound center from Lititz, Pa., is
the only returning letterman
there. Coach Bunn will have
to start four sophomores, David
Sawyer, Dick Ronchi, John Wa-
tusik and Tom Klein, in the
line positions. These linemen
average 215 pounds per man.
Coach Smith will call on jun-
jor quarterback Jimmy Poole to
spark the ‘Cat attack.
Anchoring the ‘Cat defense
will be container Pack Hindsley

and corner back Tommy Dews.
The defense will again be with-
out the services of George Sol-
Jey and Dick Short. Both Short
and Solley ware sidelined last
week due to injuries.

The game tomorrow marks
the second time the two teams
have met on the gridiron. David-
son presently holds a 1-0 edge.

The team left Davidson to-
day by jet for Newark, N. J.
and then motored to Easton.

Footballers Win
Over Engineers

Davidson’s Wildcats regained the formula for win-
ning football with quarterback Jimmy Poole piloting a -
strong ‘Cat offense to three offensive records as they

downed Lehigh last Saturday 37-23.

Poole’s 230 yards total offense
is a Davidson football record.
A new record for team-passes-
completed was set as 18 aerials
found the mark. Twenty-three
first downs tied the record for
the most in a single game.

Lehigh’s defense bothered the
Wildcat offense by stunting in
the middle of the line early in
the game. However, once the
line began to open holes through
this stunting defense the backs
were able to gain yardage eas-
ily.

The Gurkha defensive unit got
stronger with practically every

a'few times by using the spread

neers got their first score. Their
other points were obtained by

the ‘Cat defense. ;
Coach Homer Smith said that
the victory should not be called
a comeback. ‘Lehigh was the
weakest team on the schedule,
There was a great difference be-
tween their talent and the
strength of William and Mary,
VMI, or George Washington.”

Kendall is currently fourth in

behind Steve Smith, Billy Tay-

Kendall is the ‘Cats leading
