eral plans of the organization were
discussed. At present, however, these
plans are not ready to be made public.

ganization as a true product of a bet-
ter Davidson.

lar program. The devotional exercises

sessed to pay for the picture of the
sponsor in the annual.

stituents, was next in order and was
discussed on the affirmative by G, M.

livered excellent speeches. ‘The
judges gave the decision to the nega-
tive.

debate was, Resolved, That each stu-
dent of Davidson College should be
required to read at least five literary
books during each semester. It was
discussed by E. C. Douglas on the af-
firmative, and P, C, Henderson on the

fact. that the average student does not
get enough literary work from his col-

. lege course while Henderson said that

the students’ time is too well taken up
*4n other activities. The judges de-
_ cided this time in favor of the affirma-

DRAMATIC CLUB GIVES
INITIAL PERFORMANCE

The regular meeting of the Dra-
matic Club on last Friday night, was
acknowledged by all to be the most
successful one ever held. The fea-
ture of the night was the presentation
vf a play, “Veterans,” written by Pro-
fessor Erwin and played by selected
members of the club. It was by far
the best’ and most pleasing piece of
dramatic work given by the club since
its organization.

Before the curtain was pulled Pro-
fessor Erwin explained the reasons
for the presentation of the play, and
the hopes of the club for the coming
season. He spoke of the play as being
merely an experiment along lines of
scenic effects and lighting. The
audience was requested to look upon
the play in the attitude of a critic, the
purpose being to point out defects and
make suggestions. After these ex-
planations by Professor Erwin, the
play was presented.

The work of Ellis Woolfolk -as
Uncle Sid was the outstanding fea-
ture of the play. The part of Mary
Belle was excellently portrayed by
Miss Frances Johnston, one of our
co-eds this year. Harry Russell, as
Lon Harbison; Peggy Martin, as
Plato, and Wallace Moore, as Finley,
all acted their parts well and deserve
much praise.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT
TO PICK VARSITY MEN

Thirty-two men signed up for the
tennis tournament which made it pos-
sible for Hugh Bradley, captain of the
team this year, and state champion last
year, to arrange a perfect schedule of
matches, which schedule has two sub-
divisions: a lower, and an upper
bracket. In the upper. bracket there

are four main asiprants for tennis
honors who will furnish plenty of com-
petition before the supremacy of this
division is decided. Namely, Harry
Price, Chink Woods, Fraser and Mac
Beall, with Price having a slight edge
on the others. Already these men, in
eliminating slightly weaker opponents,
have shown some real class, and some
splendid matches have been played.

In the lower bracket, the indications
seem to point to the playing off of even
more exciting matches than those
promised in the upper bracket. Bill
Murray is proving himself real varsity
material, and handles the old racket
like a second Tilden. T. F. Staley is
showing his old-time form. Due to a
charley-horse, however, he has been
handicapped somewhat, but that is a
thing of the past now, and Staley’s
racket may well be feared by all from
now on. Jimmie Trotter is another
racketeer showing up well, while the
old reliable Henry Morris and Vic
Brown continue to show their skill at
the game as they rapidly hew down all
opponents,

Before the championship of this
tournament is decided, some royal bat-
tles will have been fought. ‘There are
three places on the tennis team to be
filled this year, and this tournament
will be a large factor in the picking of
these three men. For this reason the
excitement in each match is intense,
and every game has its thrills. Come
out and boost your favorite to win!

NAPPY AND GIG STAR
IN RECENT PRODUCTION

Sprunt Field was the scene ot a
spectacular movie on last Thursday
afternoon. Gig Shepherd and Nappy
Davis were the stars, and the thifig
came off in fine style. The only regret
is that the camera man failed to be on
hand,

Nappy and Gig had seen sow Valen-
tino, Wallace Reid and others pulled
off the heroic stuff so they decided that

J-}those birds didn’t have a thing on

them. They arranged to pull off one
of those slow-motion movies so as to
show how much better they were than
“Red” Roberts, Jim Thorpe and all the
other guys who ever attempted to play
football. ‘The first scene was to be a
forward pass. ‘The ball was passed to
Gig who speedily yet slowly raised the
ball in perfect form and shot it in the
direction of Nappy who was making
long strides slowly down the field.

Nappy was truly the star in this fea-
ture production. With arms out-
stretched to grasp the whirling pigskin
and head poised in perfect form, eves
on the ball, le watched its approach
unmindful of any foe who might be
near, But the unexpected happened.
Just as the noble Nappy drew his arms
in to capture the ball, they were
clasped around, not a football, but
something human, something real ! The
final close-up showed Nappy grasping
some one around the neck, a divine
smile upon his face gazing into the
dancing, joyous eyes of Coach Grey.

PURPOSE OF NEW DITCH
SYSTEM IS REVEALED

The system of irrigation canals
which has recently enmeshed the
campus has proven a remarkable suc-
cess and an everlasting monument to
its originator. In its primary function
to convey all available water from the
four corners of the campus to the
laundry for Mr. Helper to use in his
garmentary toning bath, it has shown
its adequacy. The uniformity of hue
of garments returning from the laun-
dry is decidedly more marked than
formerly,

These ditches not only regulate the
flow of water upon the campus, but to
a large measure the flow of profanity.
In rainy weather, many students on
nocturnal excursions between remote
buildings on the campus have been
checked abruptly in their extravagant
outpouring of execrations against the
inclemency of the weather by a unani-
mous descent of all their members con-
fusedly into one of these trenches, The
individual is usually so overcome with
his good fortune in being precipitated
into a comfortable: tarn of muddy
liquifaction, rather. than upon jagged
rocks and grievous projections, that his
blasphemy of the elements spon-
taneously changes to a song of praise

and deliverance.

DEVEREUX COMPANY SOON T0
‘PRESENT ROMEO AND JULIE

Play Will Be Given on Nover-
ber 4th

The Clifford Devereux Company
of Artists will present Romeo and
Juliet at Shearer Hall on November
4th. Mr. Devereux is now on his
eighth annual tour and is playing the
classics which have taken a place
among the finest of the world’s litera-
ture,

In presenting these plays, Mr.
Devereux has sought to place them in
their right atmosphere and to give
them the fine interpretation they
deserve. Many people have read
and studied them-in school or college,
but they can never be so appreciated
as they will be, after Mr. Devereux’s
production of them has been witnessed.
It is with lofty ideals, a wide outlook,
a deep understanding, and a sympathe-
tic insight that he has approached these
masters, and taken from them all their
richness, their unfathomable clever-
ness, their scintilating brilliance, and
their unmatched genius. The qualities
of the plays are made apparent and all
their phases revealed through methods
of unassailable reasonableness and
convincing authority. s,

The highest recognition has been

accorded the Clifford Devereux Com-|

pany for their unique and artistic
work, as is evidenced by their frequent
engagements at Columbia University,
University of Virginia, University of
West Virginia, University of Georgia,
University of Tennessee, University of
Texas, University of Wisconsin, and
at the leading colleges in the country,
including Vassar, Penn State College
and many others.

FRESHMEN DEFEATED
BY SENIORS, 13 TO 12

The famous old class of ’23 has
started off this season in the court
game in the same fine style as they
wound up the class series last year.
In their first game the Fresh were de-
feated, 13 to 12, ‘The same old fight
and pep was present which enabled
them to carry off championship honors
last year. The Freshmen showed un-
usual strength and led the upper class-
men through a big part of the contest,
but just before the final whistle the
Seniors forged ahead by one lone
point,

It was a beautiful game throughout ;
close, fast, hard-fought and exciting.
At no time did either team lead the
other by anything more than a few
points. The Fresh led at the close of
the: first half, 7 to 4. Most of the
points of the evening were made from
the free-throw line. A large crowd
Was present to witness the scrap.

The men who looked best for the
Seniors were Toney and Mauze, while
Davis, Caddell and Bachman showed
the best stuff for the new men.

Following is the line-up:

- DENGUE FEVER

This fever was formerly considered

Davis (0)

a tropical disease, but it is now|

epidemic in the Southern States,
though mostly on the coastal plains. It
is transmitted by the bite of the mos-
quito (Culex fatifians), but the organ-
ism in the blood has not been fourtd by
misroscopic observation. ‘The fever
comes on four days after the mosquito
bite, and is characterized by severe
pains in all the bones and joints, hence
its name “break-bone fever.”

An attack lasts about four days, and
while it is seldom a fatal disease, the

convalescence is slow and it may take
several weeks before the patient re-
covers his accustomed strength. The
treatment is mainly symptomatic and
so far no satisfactory remedy has been
found.

THOMAS MEIGHAN SEEN

IN GOQD PHOTOPLAY
Thomas Meighan, supported by
Leatrice Joy and Lois ‘Wilson ap-
peared here Saturday night in the
photoplay, “Manslaughter.”

Thomas Meighan, as Daniel J.
O’Bannon, district attorney, was much
in love with Lydia Thorne, played by
Leatrice Joy, who was heiress to a
large fortune. O’Bannon deplored the
condition of the modern dissipation at
the parties given by Lydia.

Lydia’s maid, Evans, played by Lois
Wilson, needed money to send-her sick
child to California, as the doctor said
that only in a warm climate was there
any hope of his recovery. In her de-
spair to get the money she sold a ring
belonging to her mistress. She was
caught and tried and as Lydia failed
to appear at the trial to plead clemency,
Evans was sent to prison. Lydia felt
sorry for her maid so she sent her little
boy to California,

Lydia was very fond of speeding
and was overtaken by a speed cop. She
got away from him the first time by
dropping a very expensive bracelet
into his hands, The second time in her
effort to elude him she turned a sharp
corner, the officer ran into her car and
was so seriously injured that he dies,

Lydia’s friends did all they could to
keep her out of court and even went
so far as to try to bribe the district
attorney. O’Bannon, however, was
determined to do his duty at any cost
and he retained his reputation of
having never lost a case. Lydia was
convicted of manslaughter and served
three years in prison. Here she met
her maid, Evans who soon forgave her
nistress for the way she had been
treated.

As the three years spent in prison by
Lydia were her making so they were
the undoing of O’Bannon. He re-
signed from the. office of district attor-
ney and resorted to whiskey in order to
forget.

After being released from prison
Lydia was indeed a different woman.
One night when she and Evans were
serving free coffee in the slum district
she happened to look into the face of
one of the men asking for his supper—
it was O’Bannon,

From that night on O’Bannor
fought his battle alone and the time
came when on the eve of his election as
governor he withdrew his candidacy
hecause an ex-convict could not be
mistress of the governor’s mansion and
because his love for Lydia far ex-
ceeded his desire to become governor.

Bill Lavill

Made some run, but hats off to
the whole team.

IF EVERY MAN

on the team had not done double
his share, we would never have

held
V. P.I.
to a tie.

We will have a man on the
campus Monday with the best
merchandise at reasonable prices.
