PHILANTHROPIC
SOCIETY TO BE
CHAPEL LEADER

The Philanthropic Literary So-];
ciety held its first meeting of the
month on April 2. After the usual
business procedure, Mr. Lyman
Kiser, new initiate, presented a
sketch of his farewell address to
his senior class in high school. Mr.
Kiser’s reading brought back vivid
memories of days dear to the hearts
of all.

Mr. Bob Cfutchfield brought be-
fore the group a paper entitled
“Sweet Chariot.” It was the touch-
ing story of a Negro caught in the
toils of circumstance and con-
demned to death. Through no fault
of his own this man was swept
away by the brush of fate to a
destiny of innocent suffering and
death.

Presented next was a publication
of a series of letters discovered by
Mr. Henry Hansen. They had been
written by an intelectual gentle-
man from Atlanta. This long lost

civilization, now existing at the
South Pole was seeking to learn
as much American as possible, thus
the letters were, in the main, com-
ments on the faults and motives of

the American way of life.’

Mr. Howard Proctor then gave
a preview of the chapel program
to be presented soon by the society.
Included in the preview was one
complete. portion of the tentative
program admirably done by Mr.
Proctor himself.

Phi Mu Alpha honorary music
fraternity announced recently that
the annual Inter-Fraternity Sing
will be held on Wednesday evening,
April 25th, at 8:15. Phi Mu Alpha
sponsors this event cach year and
has gradually become one of the
most eagerly awaited and enthusia
tically entered events of the year.
Last year the cup was won for the
third consecutive time by the Cam-
pus Club which, by the rules of the
contest, now owns this cup per-
manently. A new cup will be award-
ed to the winning fraternity. this

furnished, by the Campus Club re-
moved by their winning of the cup,

to establish a trend which will cul-
minate in ownership of the cup.

At this year’s event the Concert
Band will present a program of mu-
sic beginning at 7:30. The rules
have been altered slightly toward
de-emphasizing any tendency to
judge the groups on a professional
basis. Copies of the rules have been

torious over Pete Kalogridis.

rowed from an original seven

ponent in the election, is from

ably as a Managing Editor for
the Davidsonian and has been a
prominent member of the For-
ensic Council. He is a member
of Beta Theta Pi social fraternity.

take over the reigns of the paper
with-in the next week and edit
the few remaining issues this
year.

Sumter’s Fall Calls
Students To Rebel
In Righteous Wrath

April 14, 1861—Thursday at
4:30 a. m. Fort Sumter was
bombarded by the militia under
Beauregard around Charleston
Bay. After red-hot cannon balls
set fire to the wooden building
which covered the esplanade of
the fort, Anderson and his men
were driven from the embra-
sures into the casements by
the stifling smoke. They (the
enemy) worked feverishly and
with gallantry as the maga-
zine’s powder was thrown into
the sea to prevent an explosive
conflagration, but resistance
of any kind was wisely deemed
futile. Then, after some parley,
the third of the surrender de-
mands was accepted by Col-
onel Anderson, Any ignominy
was avoided and Anderson’s
evacuation of the fort was con-
ducted with the usual honors
of war. A final salvo of 50
guns before the northward de-
parture occasioned the only
fatality and this was a_ sol-
dier who was killed by a frag-
ment of a gun which exploded
in saluting the Federal flag.

It was seen that the fall of
Fort Sumter was received by
the people of Davidson with
transports of joy and the stu-
dent body is now redoubling
their preparations to succor
the secession movement — al-
ready afoot in the Confeder-
acy as evidenced by the re-
