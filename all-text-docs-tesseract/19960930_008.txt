Saad Gul

Iam a VERY angry Pakistani

“I know Pakistan.Pakistan is a
good friend of mine. What was
presented in these pages last week
was no Pakistan.”

My first reaction to the piece
that appeared in these pages a week
ago was one of absolute outrage.
Why? Where did these figures
come from? And when people be-
gan asking, it came to pass: there
were probably far more people out
there who read it all, accepted it,
and internalized it. Pakistan can be
safely bashed, itistrue. Asa “brown
Islamic” country, one doesn’t run
into the same problems that would
arise if say, Africa, Latin America,
or even the Far East were criti-
cized. In over three years in
America, I have seen maybe a
dozen negative news stories about
Pakistan, and not a single positive
one.

Yes, we have problems. The
entire world does. I would be the
last one to deny that. But we are
nowhere the nightmarish backwa-
ter hell that was presented in the
article. So let me offer a few points
in our defense, and all I ask is that

‘you keep an open mind. Firstly, the .

head of the Pakistani government,
Benazir Bhutto, is a woman. That
in and of itself should say a lot.
Secondly, so is her second in com-
mand. Bhutto defeated her two
brothers to become head of her
party, so her position is not by

default. The people had a choice,
and they elected her.Feeling better
yet?

Now to the unpleasant parts.
To be raped is NOT a crime in
Pakistan. I don’t know how to put
it in simpler terms. It is not. In
1982, fourteen years ago, there
was a single instance where a legal
bungle led to the arrest of the vic-
tim by mistake. The outcry. was
immediate, the victim was swiftly
released with the personal apolo-

Rape) and WAF (Women’s Ac-
tion Forum)], the

government instituted a Women’s
Police Force. Run exactly parallel
to men’s police, this force runs its
own patrols, precincts, and makes
its own arrests. This force, all fe-
male by law, is the ONLY one
allowed to arrest women. Women
cannot be held in a male police
station. Therefore, the figures of
women prisoners being raped in
custody are ludicrous. It’s simply

of consent. I have NEVER heard
of the “two-fingers” test which the
article espouses. Nor of four Mus-
lim witnesses being required for a
conviction. I can assure the reader
that Pakistani justice is swift in
rape cases, and the rapist normally
pays the price for his sins within
an year of the crime. NOT ONCE
have I ever read of four witnesses
being present or being asked for.
Zina, on the other hand, or an
accusation of extra-marital sex in-

ures of the number of rape victims
in Pakistani jails came from. (See

below for my own sources). But I .

DO know this: with three amnes-
ties in the past 10 years for all
female convicts (except terrorists
and murderers), the number of fe-
male prisoners in Pakistan is mi-
nuscule. In 1989, there were liter-
ally fewer than two dozen female
prisoners in the Republic.

Under strong pressure from
the women’ s rights movement [yes,
we have a STRONG women’s
rights movement that includes
APWA (All Pakistan Women’s
Association), WAR (War against

impossible. And, I would like to
remind you that per capita, accord-
ing to SUNY-Albany, the United
States has TWENTY-SEVEN
times as many rapes as Pakistan.
(And no, I don’t believe that we
have any special disgrace attached
that leads to massive under report-
ing, which the study attempts to
compensate for in any case).

On to the law. The article
confused two different components
of the law. Zina ul jabr, or rape, is
far easier to prove than zina, or
extramarital sex. Rape is proved in
the same way it is in the US: with
physical evidence proving absence

people to back me up. If I don’t, I
have falsely accuse someone, an-
other grievous charge. I will pay a
heavy price for accusing an inno-
cent man or woman.

In addition, I have considered
the specific incidents provided in
the article. Rape is a serious crime
in Pakistan. Rarely does it fail to
warrant the death penalty. The
Prime Minister normally (and this
is a long standing tradition, pat-
terned on the time of the Caliphs,
preceding Bhutto) pays a personal
visit to the family of the victim.
The case is normally handled un-
der the direct supervision of the

President’s Body Guard, the Paki-
stani version of the Secret Service.
I could not find any law or press
reports about the cases cited in the
article.

I can say that similar cases in
1990 were handled swiftly, and all
the perpetuators (save one, who
happened to be underage) have
been sentenced.

Where do MY figures come
from? Well, the Pakistani Ministry
of Law, APWA, and War Against
Rape. SUNY-Albany has some
good statistics.

In addition, my grandfather is
a justice of the Supreme Court of
Pakistan and provided a quick over-
view of the Law on Rape, so I
believe I have solid grounds on
which to base my assertions. Hav-
ing lived there, and having access
to first hand and unbiased sources,
I will stand my ground against
anyone who attempts to prove oth-
erwise.

Like I said earlier, I do not
believe that Pakistan is a Utopia.
But I do want to point out that
traditional Islamic law provided a
woman’s right to inherit property,
engage in business, and divorce
their husbands over 1300 years
before European law did.

We abolished the traditional
South Asian practice of bride burn-
ing. Not bad really, for a bunch of
strange brown people from far
away.

The following are excerpts from a
column written in The
Davidsonian, by Jay Ferguson '92
and Anthony Foxx ‘'93, on Janu-
ary 20, 1992:

“Tt is the year 2007, and stu-
dents from the year 199] and ‘92
gather for a school reunion. We
join our two pontificants, J: and
A;, little older, a little wiser, and
more attuned to the simpler plea-
sures of life... .

J: Well, here’s the student di-
rectory, but now that I think about
it, how are we supposed to know
which of these students is black?
Let’s ask Mr. Eaves.

A: Dean Eaves! Hey, remem-
ber, ‘92 and ‘93, Davidsonian col-
umn “Questionin’ That?” It’s J:
and A:. We’re looking for some
current black students to talk to.
When we left, black students were
making an indelible mark on
Davidson and its future. We want
to know what’s going on.

J: Uh-uh. . . Uh-huh. . . You
don’t say! Dean Eaves, you’ve got
to be putting me on. Do you expect
me to believe that there is not one
single black student on this entire
campus? I mean, this is 2007, for

Ike Bailey "95 and the Black Student Coalition

Black Student Life at Davidson College

crying out loud! Black student en-
rollment and graduation rates have
been on the rise for the last 10 ten
years! What’s wrong with this pic-
ture?

A; Come to think of it, there
was another development taking
place as-we left. The attrition rate
for black students increased for
the same reason that the numbers
of black students stayed consis-
tently low: Davidson adjusted, but
itdidn’t change. The school seemed
perfectly willing to allow students
to initiate things, but it never ex-
tended beyond itself to meet the
demands of a burgeoning, diverse
group of students.

J: One thing that would have
pleased many of the black students
thatwere here thenwas for there to
have been more blacks in positions
of authority at Davidson. I recog-
nize that, at that time, the competi-
tion for black administrators and
faculty was heavy. However,
Davidson made no effort to hold
onto the quality people that it al-
ready had. Losing people like that
really hurtmy feelings, andI sensed
that I wasn’t alone in that senti-
ment.
A: No you weren’t. Those de-

velopments hurt us and the school.
I couldn’t help feeling a little
strange walking across the stage
at graduation. I was glad to be
walking, to be sure. But I also felt
like one day I would return and
find no more black people and no
diversity, and I have!

J: With the benefit of hind-
sight, it’s clear that there were
numerous things that could have
been done to avoid what we’re
seeing now... We knew that diver-
sity in numbers did not directly
translate into a diverse environ-
ment. We knew that action needed
to be taken to ensure that the main-
stream would reach out and engulf
students that were outside of it,
instead of forcing them to compro-
mise their character in order to fit
in. I guess nobody listened until it
was too late.”

It’s not too late. But if you
were looking for diversity and hap-
pened to gaze at the pictures on
display in the College's Union
Gallery entitled “Davidson in Ret-
rospect,” you may well think that
Foxx and Ferguson were on to
something. ”

But, it’s not that late. For the

fall of ‘96, there are still 67 en-
rolled black students at Davidson.
That number is more than none,
but hardly represents a critical
mass. From the years 1983 through
1992, 160 black students enrolled
at Davidson; 119 decided to stay
and finish their undergraduate de-
gree here. We don’t pretend to
know the exact reasons why those
41 students did not finish here, but
we do havea pretty good idea. And
if you are really concerned about
Davidson’s future, its struggle to
become more diverse, and some of
the reasons why those 41 students
did not remain, then we suggest
you attend “School Daze: A Parody
of Black Student Life at Davidson”

with his struggles and the struggles
of those like him, found out some-
thing very interesting: that they
really weren’t friends. The client
said (paraphrase): “Jake, we’re not
friends, and we never have been. I
chose you because you are one of
them, because you think like them.
.. Our daughters: don’t play to-
gether, and you don’t even know

where I live.”

If you have any concern or are
interested in finding out more about
black reality at Davidson College,
you will attend the parody and
discussion, bring those tough ques-
tions you’ ve always wanted to ask,
and listen, really listen. Come find
out where black Davidson students
live. And when you have some,
maybe your daughters could play
together.
