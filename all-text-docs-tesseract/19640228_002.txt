LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Rule Blasts ‘Visit’ Review,
Myers Retorts In Defense

Dear Editor: .

The review of *‘The Visit’' was
“very exciting indeed." espec-
jally with ‘ts ned pseudo-avant
gardism ‘‘such as has never
been seen on this campus.** The
reviewer ‘‘does exceptionally
well” to produce a work which
is ‘‘on the whole good,"’ but ‘‘stil!
something is lacking’'—or per-
haps a couple of things. such
as Support and consideration.

‘Nearly professional heights”
and ‘‘depth and technique’ may
be “effective for the most part”
but as descriptive terms they
are imprecise and unfortunately
typical. The grouped reference
to unrelated.events (chorus and
band) as ‘‘superior’’ in one sen-
tence and simply ‘‘commenda-
ble’ in the next is perhaps the
Paradox our theologians have
been telling us about.

More disturbing however,
were several personal “digs.”
A single characteristic (asser-
tion), though salient, ts insuf-
ficient basis for any fair com-
parison (implicit) of one man
with his predecessor. What be-
comes a value judgment with
repetition certainly deserves
more substanfiation than just
what “‘one feels’’—possibly as
a result of personal disagree-
ments.

To the reader trying. to dis-
cover where the ‘‘unrealized po-
tential’ really lies. I submit that
for the worst though not the first
time, the DAVIDSONIAN Drama
Critic ‘‘misses the boat’ and
should be given his own advice
concerning the butler—some
people are best seen but not
heard.

Bill Rule

MYERS ANSWERS:

The complete misinterpreta-
tion of my review by Mr. Rule
compels me to comment on the
bulk of his letter. His contention
seems to be that my review is

ambiguous, guarded, and pre-
sumptiously ‘ authoriative. No
review claims to be: authorita-
tive. and I certainly do not lay
this claim in my review of ‘The
Visit." These were purely my
thoughts as they occurred, on
Thursday night's performance of
a very interesting play. He does,
however, in the third paragraph,
raise a truly pertinent point.

There he says: What be-
comes a value judgment with
repetition certainly deserves
more substantiation than just
what ‘one feels’—possibly as a
result of personal disagree-
ments.” In the first place, |
never made a “value judg-
ment,”’ | only raised questions,
and it is only the validity of
those questions that can be
disputed. These questions
arose as | watched the produc-
tion, and | put them down.
Surely, this is no violation of
the critie’s role.

Let us take these ‘‘digs’’ one
at a time,

1.) “One feels that stronger
direction is needed to bring out
the best that is apparent in both
these people."” We have here a
lack of the ‘‘necessary’’ vitality
with one actor. and another
actor whose best moments are
those in his hardest scenes.
There are two alternatives, one:
that the actors have not done
their best. and two: that the
director has not seen those mis-
takes in what. are the easiest
scenes. Due to the under-aver
age (to me, again) quality of
the whole production that night,
T chose the director.

2.) ‘Unrealized potential’ has
a great many meanings, true.
Here it is left up to the reader
(or viewer) to answer the ques-
tion: Is this the fault of the di-
rector or the actors themselves?

3.) The “assertive direction”
comes of a natural conse-
quence of the above observa-
tions, and is in no way meant

to “compare” or intimidate
the director and his capabili-
ties. And the director has great
capabilities, as was shown in

his last production!

In closing. may I suggest that
anyone who wishes to criticize
the review should read it care-
fully, first of all, then if they
think something is wrorig. to
choose much more valid exam-
ples of their criticism than Mr.
Rule has done.

Dear Editor:

As a Davidson College alum-
nus and at present a minister
to students in Raleigh. I rise to
the defense of the visit of Dr.
Michael Scriven to the Davidson
campus.

T heartily concur with the wis-
dom of letting students hear the
point of view of the atheist.
Christianity has never been a-
fraid of genuine encounter with
other beliefs, and its earliest
advocates were ardent apologists
who tried to articulate the Chris-
tian faith to the philosophies of
their day. Any faith that could
be shaken by such encounters is
not faith, but credulity or blind
belief.

Rather than shaking students’
faith, I have found that students
rediscover their faith in such
encounters, and become less dis-
satisfied with the worn-out
cliche of contemporary Chris-
tendom.

T am grateful that my Alma
Mater does not allow its Chris-
tian ethos to be exempted from
the questions of modern man,
but is out in the midst of the
battle, relying solely on the
power of its own inherent truth.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Carolina Solons Reject
Civil Rights Proposals

Dear Editor:

There has been much publicity
in this newspaper recently about
a newly formed student civil
rights group on the Davidson
campus which favors passage of
the civil rights legislation now
pending in Congress. We just
want to clarify the fact that not
all the members of our student
body have taken leave of their
senses! There are some of us
who still have respect for the
constitutional rights of proper-
ty, state’s rights, and the free-
dom of association. These ir-
responsible young radicals seem

to think that said rights are ob-
solete. There are those of us
who stand strongly opposed to
the civil rights legislation now
pending in Congress, which we
believe is unrealistic, unconsti-
tutional, and dangerous. It would
be impossible to enforce without
the formation of a police state
and the result of violence. Said
legislation is an unwarranted
federal grasp for power and an
attempt to solve, by legislation,
basic problems of human rela-
tionships which should be solved
by the church and private nego-
tiations on the local level, not by
pickets or power politics.

A number of the local civil
righters have been sending let-
ters to their congressmen urging
passage of the civil rights bill
now pending in Congress. This
(sending letters to congressmen)
is at least a civilized way of ex-
pressing their views and at-
tempting to approach the prob-
lem, We also wrote letters to the
senators from our state (North
Carolina) expressing some of our
views. For the benefit of our
fellow Davidsonians we are en-
closing a copy of the replies
which we received from the Hon-
orable Sam J. Ervin, Jr. and
the Honorable B. Everett Jor-
dan, United States Senate.

J. L. Powell
R. N. Powell

United States Senate
Committee on the Judiciary
February 14, 1964

Dear Mr. Powell:
This is to acknowledge and
thank you for your thoughtful

letter of February 12 which I
have read with much interest,
and to assure you that I will
continue to do everything with-
in my power to defeat the pend-
ing civil rights proposals.

These proposals are incom-
patible with the Federal sys-
tem of government establish-
ed by our Constitution, and
the basic economic, legal, and
personal rights of all our citi-
zens.

With all kind wishes, I am
Sincerely yours,
Sam J. Ervin, Jr.

SENATOR JORDAN REPORTS
By Senator B. Everett Jordan

WASHINGTON—At no time in
recent years has any domestic
crisis gripped the emotions of
our State and Nation like the
recent racial demonstrations.

We have reached the point
where there is a very fine line
between peaceful demonstration
and mob violence. All of our
citizens have every right to
peaceful assembly and peaceful
petition, but we have reached
a point where those who are
demonstrating must use just as
much restraint as those who are
being demonstrated against.

No matter how just a cause
may be, the rule of violence is
the rule of ruin.

I sincerely hope that we will
see an immediate end to the
demonstrations and an end to
the wave of emotion that has
swept the country.

1 feel that there has been a
definite tendency in recent
years on the part of many
people to advocate new laws
fo accommodate each situa-
tion that arises rather than
seek solutions under existing
laws.

Under our system of govern-
ment, we cannot forget that the
law applies with equal force re-
gardiess of where it is being ap-
plied and regardless of whom it
is being applied for or against.

The latest suggestion, as rec-
ommended by the President, is

for a Federal law requiring vir-
tually each and every private

business in the United States to
do business with any customer
who wishes to buy goods or
services regardless of who he is.

It is argued that such a law
would give rights to many citi-
zens who are now being discrim-
inated against.

However, the moment such a
law goes into effect, and thereby
gives any person the right to
go into any business establish-
ment and demand service with
the full force of the Federal
government behind him,

ed.

We have not contributed to
the total freedom of man when
we pass a law taking one right
away from all of our people in
order to give a right to some
of our people.

To me, this is the crux of the
proposed Federal public accom-
modations law, and I sincerely
feel that if Congress passed such

a law it would create more prob-

lems than it would solve.
In many, many towns

cities in recent months, literally

thousands of doors have been
heretofore
closed. They have been opened

~—and they will stay open I be-
lieve—because reasonable men

opened that were

have found reasonable solutions.

Although I appreciate how our

Negro citizens feel when they
are denied service in business
establishments, it would be a

serious mistake to enact a Fed-
eral law that would divide rather
than uite at a time when per-
suasion is proving that it is a
much better vehicle for under-
standing and good will than
force and police power.

the
right of the owner and operator
of that business to choose his
own customers has been destroy-

BY JOE

HOWELL

There has been quite a lot.of controversy and mis-
givings concerning the proposed civil rights demonstra-
tion in Charlotte. I would like to try to answer some of
the questions which have been raised concerning the

event.

The demonstration will begin
at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday, March
14, on the Johnson C. Smith Uni-
versity campus in Charlotte. Af-
ter several speeches by students,

| the participants will proceed to

the post office where delegates
from the various schools and col-
leges will mail petitions, urging
the President of the United
States to give the present legisla-
tion his full. support.

(We are mailing the petition
to the President for two rea-
sons: (1) He is the one man
in the country who has the
power and personal influence
to see that a strong bill is
passed. (2) Because of the
representation from many dif-
ferent states, we feel that our
voice should not be limited to
just one Senator or Congress-
man. The President is the
chief representative and
spokesman for all the people.)

Students, professors.
members of the community from
Davidson (many of whom will
walk the twenty miles to Char-
lotte), Livingston, Barber-Scotia.
Queens, Johnson C. Smith, Char-
‘lotte College, and Pfeiffer are
expected to-attend.

The purpose of the march is
to show our support for strong
civil rights legislation. This does
not mean that all the partici-
pants have exactly the same
feelings concerning the present
bill in Congress. Some feel that
the bill with all its provisions,
including Public Accommoda-
tions, FEPC, etc., is an absolute
necessity: some are not sure of
their attitudes about all parts
of the bill; and some are dubious
of the stronger sections.

The one thing on which all
agree is that racial discrimina-
tion, which has existed and now
exists in this country, is wrong
and that it is the responsibility
of our Federal government by

LETTER TO

This letter is written in refer-
ence to the attendance at church
services last Sunday by sev-
eral Davidson students with
Negro companions.

However, it is meant neither
as an apology for nor a justifi-
cation of these proceedings.
These words are merely an at-

‘tempt to clarify the apparent

misconception of numerous Dav-
idson students and people of the
community as to the nature and
purpose of this incident. If one
opposes these actions and wishes
to hold some malice toward the
participants, he should certainly
withhold |his feelings until the
facts are known. After all, no
student of a liberal arts college
would want to maintain bigoted
ideas which were based on weak
or incorrect facts.

Judging by the response of
some people attending services
at the College Presbyterian
Church last Sunday, I received
the impression that they felt
this small group of Davidson
students dated Negro girls from
Johnson C. Smith and took them
to church here as a form of
demonstration by attempting to
anger people and subsequently
disrupt the service, or some-
thing of this nature. This idea is
wholly fallacious, although the
external signs could lead one to
such a conclusion.

The seven or so students in-

MARCHERS’ PETITION

To the President of the United States:
We, the undersigned, urge you to support the

civil rights legislation now under debate in the
Congress of the United States with every constitu-
tional and personal power at your command.

and:

the passing of a strong civil
rights bill, to see that the exist-
ing evils are alleviated.

“But,” you reply. ‘some of us
believe in civil rights, we just
don't believe in a demonstration.
It runs against our nature. Isn't
there some other way... "
There are other ways of express
ing one’s committment which
are presently being conducted
in the Davidson community: the
Negro tutorial program, recre-
ational programs in the Negro
community. .Davidson students
visiting colored schools, voter
registration, and individuals
writing their Congressmen and
Senators. But in the present sit-
uation something more is need-
ed. The strongest civil rights bill
of this nation's history is being
presented to the Senate.

This bill is a giant step for-
ward in combatting the dis-
crimination agains! the Negro,
and if the legislation does not
pass or {s severely weakened,
the struggle for first class
citizenship for all cltizens will
suffer a great set back. If we
believe in civil rights fegista-
tion, It is imperative that we
fake a stand and express our
views in action as well as
words.

The political influence of such
a demonstration is difficult to
determine. Since marches such
as this are being planned all
‘across the United States, we
hope some senators who are on
the border line will be influenced
in favor of a strong bill. Even if
the demonstration does not di-
rectly influence Congress, it. will
do something just as important:
it will focus attention on the fact
that there are students in the
South of both races who are in
favor of civil rights, who are in
favor of strong legislation to
help bring this about, and who
are willing to stand up for what
they believe.

THE EDITOR

Federman: Negroes
Not Student Dates

Dear Editor:

volved are attempting to create
better understanding and friend-
ship between the Negro and
white communities in Davidson.
One of the ways which this is
hoped to be accomplished _ is
through the exchange of relig-
ious ideas and practices, and by
worshipping together.

At 10:00 a:m. we attended a
short worship service and then
had a Sunday School discussion
lesson with the young people at
the Negro Presbyterian Church.
No one raised his eyebrows at
our being there. Those students
who were interested were invited
to join us for worship at the
white churches. One of the young
men did not care to join us; the
other wished to attend the Me.
thodist Church, It so happened
that the rest of the Negro stud-
ents present were girls. They
decided to attend the Presby-
terian Church.

Since we specifically did not
want this endeavor to look like
a demonstration of any kind, it
was conducted on a_ personal
basis. By not having one large
group of Negroes enter the
Church banded together, it was
hoped that a scene would not be
created. The Negro fellow who
went to the Methodist Church
was accompanied by one of the
Davidson students: each of the
girls was also accompanied by
one or two of the Davidson stud-
ents. These girls were high
school students from the town,
and not dates from Johnson C.
Smith or any other place.

The topic of Rev. Harper's
sermon was unknown to all in-
volved, although it was quite ap-
propriate for the occasion. This
exchange -of visits and ideas
seems to be an excellent way of
bring about what Rev. Har-
per spoke of—true Christian un-
derstanding and love.
