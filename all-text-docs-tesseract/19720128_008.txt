Lead IMAC; Keeter’s Falls

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor

The Betas knocked Keeter’s
from the unbeaten ranks 54-45
Mcuday as Dennis Cholak fired
in 21 points, leaving only three
teams unbeaten in IMAC bas-
ketball.

The outside gunnery of Cho-
lak, Randy Ely, and Scott Nich
olson propelled the Betas in a
35-33 halftime lead, which Kee-
ter’s was unable to overcome.

Gary Scibal’s 14 poimts was
high for the losers, who dropped
to 6-1 and into a second-place
tie with the Betas in League B.

The Delts, (8-0) continued to
roll, blasting Emanon 2 76-47,
before rallying to down upset-
minded Sentelle 4 66-0 Tuesday.

Greg Sikes popped in 27
points to pace the win over
Emanon, and poured in 59 as
the Delts overcame a 37-32 half-
time deficit to edge Sentelle 4.

Emanon | and Porter’s both
remained unbeaten in League C
at 7-0.

Tarver Picked In Handball

By PETE CELENTANO
Staff Writer

This \ear’s intramural hand-
ball championship will offer a
more unique setup than last

vear's.

time there will
be organized leagues with fra-
ternities, halls, and
independents competing for
team, rather than individual,
championships.

For the firs

freshman

There are two leagues. each
the end of
seven rounds of play, to be com-
pleed by Feb. 19, the top four
each league will go
to un cight-team single elimina-
where the
winner will be decided.

League B. while not. strong
overall, does have the probable
Champion .1 the SPE‘s. Led by
Buzz Tarver, the premier hand-
the Davidson campus
and last vear’s individual cham-
pion, the SPE’s figure to repeat
as tithe holders,

Figuring to give the SPE's
compedtion ure the ATO‘’s and
an independent: team, the Klut-
zes.

The former have a censistent
and aggressive competitor in
Charlie Summe:s and a compe-
tent backup man in Doug Berry
and could surprise.

The jatter, with rangy Frank
Soos and aggressive (though in-
consistent) Den Parman, pose
a threat in doubles competition.

The Betas and Pax 1 will
probably fight it out for the
final playoff spot.

Pax I has lefty Steve Earp,
probably the best sophomore
handballer, and Charlie Slagle
and is the choice to hold. off
the Betas, who have no out-
but are very
steady ind could upset the top
four,

League A does not have any
individual of Tarver’s talent,
but, overall, is much stronger
than League B. The favorite
here is Fanny. and Mabel, with
Lynn Wagner. He is aggressive
and cagy, and has a chance at
dethroning Tarver.

Behind F and M are four
teams evenly matched in tal-

with eight teams. At

eam ww

tion tournament,

baller on

standing talen’,

ent and experience. The Delts,
led by Ross Manire, Tom Trax-
ler and Frank McShane, are
strong and fast.

Challenging them for the sec-
ond spot will be SAE’s, whose
McCloud and Mitchener are
equally as fast and more ex-
perienced than the Delts.

Scrambling for the last play-
olf spot are the Mavericks, an-
other independent team, and
Emanon.

The former is led by Bernard
Scoggins who, when he is right,
is one of the best players in the
league. Russ Merritt comple-
ments Scoggins’ strength with
his scrambling style and makes
them a solid playoff contender.

Emanon's athletic sophomores,
led by Larry Ruddell, should
make it close, but will probab-
ly finish a strong fifth.

The final three places are
pretty much up for grabs.
