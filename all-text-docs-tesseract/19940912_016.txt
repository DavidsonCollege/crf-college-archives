THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1994

ev. James Forbes,

the minister for one of}

the country's largest multicultural
congregations, talks about health care, socialism,

and the Spirit's agenda.

You attended New York
City’s Union Theological Semi-
nary before you were ordained
as‘a Pentecostal minister. How
were your charismatic reputa-
tion and southern background
received in anenvironment well-
known for its liberalism and Bib-
lical criticism?

Interestingly enough, when I
went to Union in 1958, it was the
same year that the president of the
school had written an article for
Life magazine claiming
Pentecostalism as the third force in
Christendom. This meant that it
was a good time to go there be-

_cause people were expressing real

interest in what this new move-
ment was about. They experienced
me as a person who came out of
that tradition and could fill in the
blanks in regards to some of the
concerns they had about it. I re-
member an occasion when
Reinhold Niebuhr warned me not
to let seminary training rob me of
the fervency of my Pentecostal
heritage.

As one of the largest
multicultural congregations in
the nation, does your church ex-
hibit racial harmony?

Riverside is one of the most
integrated contexts that I have seen.
I find that-there is an inclusion of
people without reference to race,

but we are still moving towards |

qualitative, mature, Christian in-
clusiveness. There are some in-
conveniences to inclusiveness
through which we are moving to-
ward that reality. -

With your sermons broad-
casted weekly throughout New
York, you are preaching to a
wide variety of listeners. To
whom is your outreach prima-
rily directed?

I want to speak to people who
are willing to allow the gospel
mandate for justice, equality, and
peace to be acommitment they are
willing to struggle with and hope-
fully to live by. I’m speaking to
people whoare progressive in their
understanding and who are com-
mitted to making the gospel real in
terms of social, economic, and po-
litical agendas and to people who

.are invested in the development of
community which transcends race
and class as qualified conditions.

Whatrole should the church
play in our lives today?

The church should be expos-
ing areas in which we are enemies
to the call of God insofar as we do

- not embrace the call to love and
understanding. I think the church
should help people to grow into
mature faith and to mobilize people
to put their faith in action in con-
crete ways. It should be a place
that celebrates the dream of the
kingdom of God that the Bible
talks about. It should be telling the
truth and bearing prophetic cri-

tique against institutions and com-
munities which oppress people. It
should help us to become islands
of commitment to justice.

The suffering in the world
today is overwhelming. Where
is God in all of the violence and
destruction?

The Christian gospel says God
is with us in the struggle. God is
especially with the poor who are
the objects of oppression, reveal-
ing the grace there—at least in
terms of an agonizing hopeful-
ness—that there could be a better
quality of life. God is in heaven

calling us to a higher standard of .

human relatedness. I believe that
God as revealed in Jesus Christ is
calling us forth to be able to live
beyond the greed and pride which
gives rise to these conditions. So
God is all over.

Have you ever been labeled
asocialist because of your strong
beliefin national health care cov-
erage?

I think of myself as a radical
relationist with a rectifying and

reconciling commitment. I know
that there is a strong anti-socialist
sentiment in this nation. I am a
Christian and do not need any fur-
ther labels to be concerned for a
more equitable distribution of re-
sources. I do not need anybody to

apply tome any termofderisionor ~

term that is likely to evoke a sense
of horror. If we take Jesus’ mes-
sage seriously, then we don’t need
any Communist or socialist to in-
struct us further. Jesus has done a
good job.

The problem is that we are so
captured by greed and pride at the
pursuit of pleasure and comfort
that the message of Jesus has be-
come odious to us, and we want to
put labels on people that are de-
signed to make us more comfort-
able with our non-compliance with
the word of God. Don’t try to
blame some other ideology if you
don’t want to comply with the work
of God.

Whatis your stance concern-
ing abortion?

Pro-life or pro-choice? What
are the values in both of these
national labels that honor both the
call to life and the recognition of
freedom and responsibility? I call
both sides to a recognition that
their virtues may be linked in a
pro-life and pro-choice viewpoint.
A- much. more. sophisticated. ap-
proach must be taken to making
such moral decisions. So don’t
give me these “either/or” perspec-
tives. Let’s getdeeper. AndI think
the Christian faith gives us re-
sources to respond to these things

"LET'S GET DEEPER"

It is often said that our gen-
eration lacks direction because
we have no heroes to follow. I
wonder if the real problem is that
we are not looking in the right
places. This worthy candidate,
however, will not pass us by with-
out ample consideration.

The moment Reverend

Forbes walked through the door

of the Davidson Village Inn,
something about him struck me
with surprise. Wide-eyed and
speechless, I attempted to ap-
proach him for an interview, but
he had already beat me to our
introduction.

“And welcome to Davidson,
Rev. James Forbes, all the way
from Riverside Church,” he ex-
claimed to me with a smile and an
outstretched hand. As we sat

down, I noticed that I approached.

REFLECTIONS ON THE INTERVIEW

the ordinary couch with
unneccessary delicacy. When he
spoke, I found myself hanging on
his words like they were drops of
gold.

Not until I heard him preach at
DCPC Sunday morning did I un-
derstand why the word “royalty”
had kept coming to my mind dur-
ing the interview the night before.

In his sermon entitled “Standing
on Holy Ground,” Forbes recalled
the story of Moses’ encounter with
the burning bush.

He proclaimed that as Moses
left the mountain anointed by the
Holy Spirit, so can we be dwelling
places for God. Listening to his
words, I realized that, according to
his teaching, the reverence he elic-
ited from me was more likely. my
response to the presence of God
within him.

_ presence of God in their lives,

“The anointing of the Holy
Spirit is the central paradigm for
our discussion,” he wrote in his
book entitled The Holy Spirit
and Preaching, and the way that
he answered my questions con-
firmed the truth of his demand-
ing statement. “Let’s get
deeper,” he kept saying in place
of the usual, simplified re-
sponses.

Forbes believes that if
people today aré unified by the

they are capable of revitalizing. _
the quality of life that was lost
with the emergence of the indus-
trial revoltion.

“We must recognize,” he
says, “that forces at work in our
culture to limit the spiritual dy-
namic of life require concerted
opposition from all traditions.”

I assume from the fact that
he has cometo speak tonight and
tomorrow night in Love Audito-
rium that Reverend Forbes is
inviting Davidson College to join
him in this fight for truth and for
a better quality of life for all
individuals.

much more deeply than these po-
litical slogans would suggest.

God the Father and God the
Son are familiar concepts to us;
why do you emphasize God the
Holy Spirit?

The scientific age causes us to
lose confidence in the sense of
spiritual depth for ourselves.
We’ve come to be surface dwell-
ers. While I am interested in its
professional competency, Iam also
interested in where the new gen-
eration of college students finds
nurture for its values and—beyond
that—where it finds strength to
live with the discipline that ac-
companies values. Everybody
needs to discover: to whom am I
accountable, from whence do I
derive my strength in the hard
places of life, and what gives me
the moral strength to pursue values
when there would be a personal
disinclination? What binds me to
community so that I am not locked
in an egocentric and narcissistic
concentration on my own self and
my own things? What pulls me

beyond the self and, at the same
time, fulfills the self? ‘What gives
me the alertness to evil and oppres-
sion? Now that’s talking about

spirit. Where do we get the wind to’

propel us into the deep waters of
genuine compassion and attention
to people? I lament that the price
we had to pay for scientific ad-
vance was the loss of faith. [would
like for college students to say that
anew maturity begins with a spiri-
tual foundation. :

You have countless invita-
tions to preach at churches ev-
erywhere. Why have you chosen
to come to Davidson, and what
message do you have for the stu-
dents here?

Ihave a great deal of respect
for Davidson as a place that is
cultivating new leadership for the
nation. Davidson. alumnae. are
found all over. It makes sense to
me that if these are the people who

are going to be shaping the new
society, I’d like to try to impact
them. I want to give them the sense
that life that is lived apart from
commitment to God does notreach
the level that God intended. We
are living in an advanced stage of
secularization, and I want to talk to
people about a faith that can make
a difference to them.

I wish to talk about the quality
of life that ought to exist on a
campus that is preparing people
for national leadership. What are
the values in this community?
What is the vision these people
have? I want to be a part of that
conversation. What kind of world
do they want to live in? I want to
talk to them about getting involved
in helping to uplift the quality of
life in the nation and particularly to
talk about health care. Otherwise,
I want to see what the Spirit’s
agenda is.
