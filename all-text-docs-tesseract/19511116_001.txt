the band of four Slourishes of
music followed by a national
song of Mexico. This is the
prescribed recognition of an of-
ficial of a foreign, friendly gov-
ernment who has the rank of
ambassador.

At an Army post on such an oc-
casion, a nineteen-gun salute would
be fired in honor of the visitor.

Ballard Learns Bi
ROTC Changes

The PMST spent all of the last week at the Infantry
School, Fort Benning, Georgia, as senior representative of the
Third Army at the national conference of Infantry ROTC

PMS&T’s. Two representatives

of each of the six Army Areas

of the continental United States were present, together with one

officer from Puerto Rico, one from
the Department of the Army, and

Under an officer from the, Infan-

one from Headquarters, Army Field | try School as monitor, the officers

Forces, Fort Monroe, Virginia,

While it is not possible to di-
vulge at this time any of what
was decided, it can be stated
that a number of major changes
in subjects were proposed, a
greatly increased use of train-
ing aids advocated, and a num-
ber of important administrative
and procedural changes decided
upon. Colonel Ballard has indi-
cated that changes will be an-
nounced as soon as official re-
lease is given.

Ga. Tech Concert
Feature Of Next
Band Excursion

The Davidson College Band will
make a trip to Atlanta over the
weekend to play at the Georgia
Tech football game, as well as a

Conducted by James C. Pfohl, the
concert will take place in the North
Fulton High School, Atlanta, Ga.,
at 8:30 Friday night, November 23.

The program for the occasion is
a varied one composed of the fol-
lowing pieces: Slow March,
Scipio, by Handel, Military Sym-
phony in F, by Grossec, which in-
cludes Allegro Maestoso, Larghet-
to, and Allegro.

Then the Overture of Rossini
on Iikla Moor, by Eric Fenby, the
Second Suite in F, made up of the

and the Man on the Flying Trapeze.

The concert will close to the
strains of O, Davidson and All
Hail, O Davidson.

World Premier

The early part of December
should present an interesting sched-
ule’ to the music-lover. On De-
cember 9, 1951, at 8:00 p.m., the
world premier of a new composi-
tion for baritone soloist, mixed
chorus and orchestra, entitled “A
Canticle of Christmas," by Vit-
torin Gianinini, will be given at

New Rules Told

For Erwin Lodge

Chaplain Aian G, Gripe has
announced a new policy for
the use of Erwin Lodge, stat-
ing that the reservation book
and the keys for Erwin Lodge
are kept at the YMCA Guest
House.

Students, faculty, or other
persons using Erwin Lodge
should make reservations at
the YMCA Guest House, call-
ing first the YMCA office at
3581, and if there is no answer,
then calling the Guest House
number, 3781. The keys to the
lodge must always be returned
to the YMCA Guest House im-
mediately after a group finishes
using the lodge.

President Guest
At Williamsburg

Dr. John Rood Cunningham will
be the feature speaker during the
50th Anniversary Celebration of the
Nine Mile Presbyterian Church in
Williamsburg, Mo., this Sunday.

Highlighting the occasion will be
the morning worship service, 2 com-
munity dinner, and an afternoon
celebration.

Dr.

spent five full days discussing many
aspects of the ROTC program and
its implementation.

Prior to reporting, each senior
representative had obtained written
views and ideas from all the senior
ROTC units in his Army Area.
Colonel Ballard had thus obtained
sixteen of these reports.

Emphasizing the thought of hav-
ing views brought out which were
as representative as possible, the
fifteen officers were divided into
three committees of five members,
each with the widest possible geo-
graphical distribution,

Colonel Ballard served on
committee number one, which
were officers from Boston Col-
lege, North Dakota State, Uni-
versity of California, Penn
State, and Davidson.

Each of the three committees ex-
amined in detail a particular area
of interest: One committee dealt
with curriculum, another with train-
ing aids, and the third with ‘gen-
eral matters.

The last day or two was spent in
a full conference of the entire
group, acting upon the recom-
mendations worked out in the three
committees. The final recommenda-
tions were unanimously accepted by
all participants and forwarded to
Army Field Forces’ Headquarters.
After being acted upon there, they
will finally be dealt with by the
Department of the Army.

THE “TEN LITTLE INDIAN”
refer to the figures on. the mantle-
piece of a weird country house
on an island off the coast of Devon.
The guests have never met one an-

out of the air accuses each one of
murder, each a case which could
not be proved in court.

As they are exchanging data on
themselves and their host, one
statue falls off the mantle piece and
breaks and a character- chokes to
death on a drink mixed with potas-

The “Y" Cabinet has voted to
take up an. offering during the
Thanksgiving Day Chapel Service
which will be given to the World
Student Service Fund.

This offering will be designed
to be a specific means of giving
thanks on this national holiday
since the cabinet feels that the

than the regular service of
praise and worship.

PAD Is Campus Nuisance
To Unmounted Collegians

By MIKE MYERS

The little old jady pulled her
thin shawl tightly about her
shoulders, her bony hands red with
cold, She nodded her grey wrinkled
head with all of the feeble anima-
tion she could muster,

She had seen a crust of bread
on the other side of the road that
might sefve as her supper. She
clutched the hand of the orphan
girl at her side and started to lead
the tattered child to the other side,

Slowly her crutch picked the way
for her stooped, tired form. She
must hurry—the wind was getting
colder and it would soon be dark,
Seventeen more miles ta walk, A
scroungy black dog dragged iteelf
along at her -heels,

zzzuumm splat mmm! Only
the little dog made it to the
other side, You see, this litle
old lady made the mistake of
trying to cross from Duke to
the gymn just before the sup-
per hour.

The student driving the car

Cunningham will also be! stopped long enough to paint a

guest minister at the morning serv- | fresh silhouette of a little old lady

ice.

and an orphan child on the side

of his radiator, then with a screech
was off on the second lap of the
Little Indianapolis Speedway. Pit
stop time: 1:37,

This fast-growing new sport
is making a smashing hit all
over the campus.

I understand that in order to be
a real wheel here you must belong
to the pedestrian-a-day club, To be
a PAD you only have to pass a
simple beginners’ test and then fol-
low 3 basic rules.

Every prospective member must
have a satisfactory qualifying time
on the one-tenth mile gravel speed
course (oval) that doubles as Fra-
ternity Court, Only charter mem-
bers are allowed to take the cut-
off through the center. The skill
comes in banking off parked cars
while running over the minimum
number of frat lawns.

Next come the club rules:
()) hem in at least 3 cars be-
hind Duke five times a week.
(2) learn to make the “60-
second-run” (from boarding |
house to P. O. uiter breakfast)
blindfolded. (3) always time it

so you meet an on-coming car
when going in or out at the
eight ball (extra points for
Mack trucks).

The PAD is no static organiza-
tion. Members are constantly ex-
perimenting with the proper posi-
tions for sandbags in their cars so
they can take the Duke curve
faster,

Racking from a parking space
without looking is a regular ritual.
The PAD's favorite weather is
misty, gloomy days. Sometimes in
such weather the pedestrian count
may soar to an average of 1.3, PAD
justly lives up to its theme song,
“I Go For You!”

Relief doesn’t even come with
night fall. Trying to sleep near a
car under an acorn tree is about
as hard to do as a tap dance
in tennis shoes——-under water.

In short it is my opinion the car
isn't here to stay-—it’s just a pass-
ing fad that will never catch on.
It will soon join the racoon coat,
goldfish swallowing contests and
marathon dances in the pages of
old Life magazines.

Campus GOP's
Polit Hopes

A recently organized Republican
political club on the campus has
run into its first obstacle. Organ-
izer Lining Burnett disappointedly
announced that the faculty forbade
the inviting of unscreened speakers
to the club from either Republican
or Democratic parties.

Called the “Hurry-Harry-Home"™
Club, it wants: first of all to create
student interest in politics,

Other points of its purpose
are to bring speakers to the
campus who believe in “the
principles America was found-
ed upon’ and to promote the
two party system in the
South.

Eligible to join are those persons
interested in “sceing the nation re-
turn to a position of respectability
and honesty," those Democrats who
believe in “the Jeffersonian prin-
ciple” and those interested in see-
ing a two-party system in the
South.

A faculty committee okayed
the formation of the club last
week with the proviso that it
clear all speaker invitations
through Dr. Cunningham. Bur-
nett said it was intimated that
the faculty “doesn't want cer-
tain Republicans and Demo-
crats to speak here.”

Meeting today for the first time,
the first members were introduced
more fully to the purposes of the
group. Next mieeting is scheduled
for after Thanksgiving.

In commenting on the establish-

ment of the club, Burnett empha-
sized “it is more important to real-
ize that membership is open nét
only to those who profess to be
Republicans, but also to those who
are disgusted with the corruptness
and socialfstic trends of the Tru-
man administration.”

Cannon stated. Already in the

open the forum series Tuesday, De-
cember 11, in chapel. The Lan-
caster legislator was recently named
one of the three top Democrats in
Congress. He has served the Presi-
dent as an investigator in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, and
was one of the four Congressmen
to witness the signing of the peace
treaty with Japan.

Just before coming to Davidson
next month Richards will be in
Centeal America studying construc-
tion of the vast new highway which
is to run through that area.

Hoey Thursday

Shelby’s Senator Hoey, tong a
Democratic. spokesman in the Sen-
ate, is chairman of the subcommit-
tee on investigation under the Sen-
ate’s committee on expenditure in
the executive department. He will
speak Thursday morning, December
13, in chapel.

Cannon hopes to fill remaining
dates: Wednesday, Friday, and the
following ‘I'uesday—with talks by
Governor Scott, Ex-Governor Thur-
mond of South Carolina, and Pow-
ell, «a member of the House of
Representatives from North Caro-
liga.

In addition to the chapel ad-
dresses, a forum on “Christianity
and Politics” is planned for Wed-
nesday evening.

Y Directors Will
Probe Puzzlers
At Tuesday Meet

Second of the joint mectings of
the YMCA Cabinet and Board of
Directors will be held Tuesday
night in the Y Lounge, following up
study of problems presented at
the first meeting late in September.

On the agenda are further
looks into the three main
topics at the first meet, includ-
ing: The present method of or-
ganizing religious activity on
the campus; How can existing
methods of dealing with re-
ligious activity be improved;
and Our affiliation with the
national YMCA.

The joint meetings were fos-
tered by Y President Allan Strand
for a closer understanding be-
tween the Cabinet and its govern-
ing body. From the first meeting

NUMBER EIGHT

nm $300,000 Gift
y\lo Davidson

All Untaxed

No taxes will be deducted from
the $300,000 recently left to Da-
vidson by the late Col. J. E. John-
ston of Baltimore. The colonet's
will stated this implicitly.

Dr. Cunningham was unable to
assert when the money would act-
ually be available to the college,
but said the time might range from
six months to the year legally per-
mitted for the disposal of such
moneys.

He noted, however, that some
rifts” to the college have taken as
long as one and one-half years.

Discrediting the myth of the
old philanthropist who is
pleased by a school and im:
pulsively bequeaths it a for-
tune, he pointed out the fact
that Johnston's gift was no sur-
prise to the administration.

Davidson was not the sole edu-
cational institution which benefited
from Johnston's benevolence. Johns
Hopkins University in his home
city of Baltimore is due to re-
ceive an equal amount of the estate.

Though recommending the
sum be used for endowment,
Cunningham reported that the
final decision will be up to the
trustees at their next meeting
in February.

His suggestion goes to the fi-
nance committee of the trustees
and then to the top ruling body it-
self.

Members of the finance commit-
tee art Messrs. Thomas McPhee-
ters, Ivey Stewart, Harvey Moore,
George Crouch and Dr. Cunning-
ham.

Converse Maids
To Adorn Campus
In Gay Weekend

Tomorrow is the big day. All the
lucky guys who were able to beat
the stampede and sign up for a
date will be rewarded when ap-
proximately 120 girls from Con-
verse College will be brought by
bus to decorate the campus for a
day.

Upon arrival at 3:30 the girls
will be met by their dates in
front of the “Y,” and will pro-
ceed directly to the gym for
refreshments and a get-ac-
quainted tea dance, with music
and entertainment to be pro-
vided througtt the courtesy of
the ‘Cripple Creek Boys.”

When this period of fun has
ended, the girls will be taken to
the boarding houses for supper, to
be followed by a period of free
time.

At eight o'clock the day will
be climaxed by the Masquer’s
latest production, “Ten Little
Indians,” for which special ad-
mission prices have been set to
make it easier on those dating.

Following the play the girls will
be returned to their busses, and a
brief but enjoyable period of co-
education will be brought to an
end.

Profs. Pop Turkey
Next Wednesday

The ROTC Department's annual
Thanksgiving Turkey Shoot will be
held Wednesday afternoon at 3:30
in the basement of the ROTC build-
ing.

Lt, Col. J. L. Ballard, in an-
nouncing plans for the faculty fir-
ing, stated that two turkeys are in
the pot for the top two marksmen.
Refreshments will be served for all
the adults, and movies with re-
freshments will be shown to all
the children while the old folks
are playing their roles of bread-
winner,

All necessary equipment will be
furnished by the ROTC Depart-
ment. ROTC personnel and their
families will not be eligible to shoot
for the prizes.
