‘ For years the adminstration has dis-
missed the potential threat posed by
UNCP’s Public Relations department,

national powerhouse. “We thought we
had no reason to worry,” stated Dean
Steve James, director of College Image.
Indeed, Davidson appeared to have no
cause for worry. Pembroke inaguarated

until “Where Learning Gets Personal”
burst on the scene and changed the game
forever.

To devise a new, more evocative slo-
gan, the College enlisted the aid of re-
nowned graphic designer Mendel Adams,
an art professor at Davidson for over 20
years. “What Mendel did with light and

The craze of thefacebook.com currently
sweeping Davidson has proven to be a
great way for students to avoid homework
and to find friends both old and new.
However, it has now become a way for
sketchy students to creep others out. By
being able to ask a distant acquaintance
or even a complete stranger to be a
“friend,” sketch-balls are able to easily
weird out other students. Moreover, the
ability to obtain other students’ AOL
screen names without their knowledge
allows for more cold-IMing from strange

"students.

Byron Shelley ’07, for example, spent a
total of three minutes talking to Grace

sent a friend request to her the same
night, five minutes after returning to his
dorm room. Shelley claims that he was
“really, really drunk, and didn’t know
what I was doing at all.” The phenomenon
is not isolated to Shelley. At least twelve
other men on campus had just enough
conversation to find out girls’ names prior
to making a friend request.

Even more sketchy was the response of
one girl, Harriet Freeman ’06, who ac-
cepted a friend request from a complete
stranger, Jordan Baker ’o8. Baker said,

I’m not a stalker. Now it’s so uncomfort-
able when I run into her in Commons or
the Union.” Freeman claimed to have
made an honest mistake in accepting the
request. “I was accepting all of my friends,
-who I know, really quickly. I must have
accepted him assuming that he was that

important issues went to the

After two and a half years of hard work
and committee discussions, the Board of
Trustees felt that it was time to unveil the
new logo for the Davidson Campus. As
said William Richardson’65, “We have
come to an agreement on the logo that will
lead us into the new century. We feel that
the logo not only is graphically pleasing,
but that it also represents the college’s
reformed Christian heritage.”

Assistant Dean of Students Carl Yeager
sent out an email this Monday asking for
a moratorium on friend requests until
further notice. The dean’s office wishes to
find a way to keep thefacebook.com “a
safe environment for all,” by allowing stu-
dents to post without fear of sketchy
stalker types. Some students, however,
believe this halt on friend requests vio-

lates their rights. “If we want to send
friend requests out to anybody, who are
they to tell us to stop? Just because I can
only remember the first syllable of a guys’
name on Sunday morning doesn’t mean
he shouldn’t be my friend!” explained
Jessica Randolph ’07.

Shelley, meanwhile, admits that he is
“very embarrassed. I didn’t think it would
turn into something like this...I mean, I
knew it was a step above getting a girl’s
phone number at a party, but still, this
makes me look like a real sketch-ball.”

Chris Mercer ’07 came back to his
room in Akers on Saturday night to find
the door locked. “I figured it was my
roommate with this girl from my physics
class, but then I
saw the message
on my white
board,” says
Mercer. The
note read, ‘Sorry
about the room.
Love, Mom and
Dad.’ It turned
out that Chris’
parents, Dan
and Jill Mercer,
had locked their
son out from his
own room for
the purpose of

his toothbrush.”
It is not difficult to find sexiled stu-
dents looking for places to sleep during

sexual activity,
commonly
known as
“sexiling.” Chris
was surprised
that his parents
had sexiled him,
but says the worst part of the experience
was the embarrassment. “I was mad at
first about having to find a place to sleep,
but then I was just upset at the thought
that my dad might have better game than
me. I mean, I didn’t come back with any-
one. I couldn’t believe I had to sleep in
the lounge while my dad’s in there hook-
ing up. Oh yeah, plus we had to throw out
that futon pad.”

Chris wasn’t the only one affected by
the Mercer’s actions. His roommate,
sophomore Jeff Platis, also had to sleep
ona couch in the Akers lounge. Platis was
visibly upset. “I hate sleeping in here. My
back is killing me from this couch, and I
got woken up in the middle of the night by
some cop asking me why I wasn’t in my
room. You can believe that was an awk-
ward conversation. All I know is that now

the weekend, but rarely are both room-
mates locked out. Dan Mercer apologized
to his son for having to lock him out but
admitted that both he and his wife were
too intoxicated to drive back to their ho-
tel room. Mr. Mercer said,

“That SAE basement was a good time.
I feel bad about locking Christopher out,
but for the amount of money I pay here,
I'm entitled to a night’s stay. I can’t imag-
ine this happens to him much anyway,
not by the looks of that Jeff kid.” Mrs.
Mercer was equally apologetic. “Oh, poor
Chris on those uncomfortable couches.
He should talk to our tour guide, she was
avery cute little girl. He’s such a shy boy.”

Dan and Jill Mercer later made the
walk of shame to their room at the La
Quinta Inn in Huntersville at 9:00 a.m.
Sunday morning.
