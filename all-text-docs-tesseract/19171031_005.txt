GOVERNOR BICKETT

(Continued from page 1)
er of the occasion, then delivered a
speech on “Why Do We Fight, and
How.”

The United States for two and one-
half years, under the most trying cir-
cumstances, maintained a perfect neu-
trality toward the warring nations. Her
long-abused patience was soothed by the
German note after the Sussex affair in
1916. But when in 1917 Germany an-
nounced to the United States that she
intended to treat this solemn promise as
she had her treaty with Belgium, this
country was forced to accept the chal-

lenge of war or lose its respect among all |

nations.

Again. America entered the war
thru gratitude to French aid during the
Revoluntionary War. To France our
very existence as a nation is due; for
when Washington's army was _half-
clothed. unpaid. and broken in morale
and ready to give up the fight. French

The DAVIDSONIAN October 31, 1917”

money and troops came to his aid. At
Yorktown — French troops numbered
more than half of his army. That peo-
ple was approaching the limits of its re-
sources in its gallant struggle and was
turning wistful eyes toward the West
for assistance, when America respond-
ed, represented by General Pershing.
when he said in Paris before Lafayette’s
tomb, “Lafayette, we are here!”

America entered the war because it
Was inevitable, and she preferred to fight
while there were France and England to
aid her. In 1892 Wilhelm IV. said that
the purpose of the Imperial Govern-
ment was to Germanize the world. He
had a map made to the same effect, with
England. France, the United States and
Canada mapped in red as German prov-
mees. Our War Department has many
facts proving that Germany intended
warring with America after she had fin
ished with England and France.

Again, America entered the war to be
a factor in determining the course of
the world after this war. Governor
Bickett said, “This war is going to de-
termine the kind of world men are go-
ing to live-in for the next thousand
years.” All forms and creeds af gov
ernment are being cast into the war and
the resultant form of government will
rule the world for a thousand years.
Hence, if American ideals are to play a
part in the future form of government
they ton must he cast into the crucible.
America has thrown into the melting-
pot her ideal of government—“A Chris-
tianized = Demacracy of Reason and
Righteousness.”

In speaking ot how the man in col-
lege can help his country, Governor
Rickett said, “by behooves the young men
who are not ready to fight, to go and
prepare for the hour when the victory
comes.” Phis hour for a-yvoung man in
college to fail te work. he continued,
‘is as cowardly as to run from war.”

Governor Bickett closed with an ar
dent appeal to college men to purchase
Liberty Loan Bonds. Speaking of the
necessity of aiding the Government in
this wav he said, “No man, no family, no
nation can have eternal life, unless there
is present the capacity when the hour
comes to sacrifice all the pleasures and
profits of today upon the altar of a great-
er tomorrow.”

The following telegrams were receiv-
‘ed and read to the student body by Pres
ident Martin: ‘
