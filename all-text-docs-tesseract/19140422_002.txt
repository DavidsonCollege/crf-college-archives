THE ALUMNI ISSUE.

Every, week since -the first issue of
“The Davidsonian” appeared, we. have
been receiving letters of cordial en-
couragement and interest from men who
though thev have graduated from Dav-
idson, cherish still an abiding affection
fot her. It is for Davidson’s Alumni,
scattered wide over the Southern States
and into the North, that this edition of
the paner is issued. It will go to every
man that has lefr the college since the.
class of 1909, and to a hundred more in
previous classes.

We send vou greeting from the cam-
pus and halls and athletic field that
were once vours. Thev are still yours
in memory and because of the common
tie that unites every Davidson man,
alumnus or undergraduate. “Once a
Davidsonian always. a Davidsonian”
Was proved clearly last week when eight
Davidson alumni at the University of

South Carolina sat together and yelled |.

for the Red and Black ‘in the two base-
ball games. Such a spirit will build ap
Davidson's influence and recruit new
men more than anv other conceivable
agency. .

“The Datidsonian” was begun as
much to cement the alumni to the col-
leve by keeping them in close touch with
all its doings and progress, as to create
and increase spirit and unity in the stu-
dent body.

Do vou want to know what Davidson
is doing in athletics, in debating, | in
every other line? Do vou want to
know what the fellows vou knew are
succeeding in at the college? Would
vou like to know. where the old fellows
—vour college mates, class mates, floor
mates, are, and how the world is treat-
ing them?) Do you want to know how
Davidson is growing?

Then “obey the impulse” that made
vou fight and yell and work for the col-
lege when here—sit down and inclose
one dollar to the Business Manager for
a subscription to “The Davidsonian,”
that will continue through next vear.
‘We need you and you “The David
sonian.”

This issue is given largely to items
about alumni and to plans for the re-
union at Commencement. Each week
there will always be a column of
Alumni Notes, and any news for it will
he most welcome.

With heart and hand let us all work
for the greater and better Davidson
that is to be!

THE WAKE FOREST SERIES.

Much depends on the Wake Forest
series this week. Wake Forest has had
an unsuccessful season, but is appearing
much stronger now and is sure to put
up a stiff fight. But Davidson undoubt-.
edly has the better team, and ought to
win. We need the games. One will
be played on the Hill and the other in
Charlotte.
the Red and Blacks such a hearty back-
ing next Friday that they will go
Charlotte determined to capture the
whole series from the Baptists.
