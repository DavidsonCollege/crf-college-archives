IMAC Teams Prepare
For Post-Season Play

By ANDY BARRON

The last few weeks of IMAC play in
men’s B-league basketball, women’s
basketball, and street hockey have seen
many close games. As B-league sorts the
top teams from the rest, women’s basket-
ball has had a new team surge to the top.
With street hockey one week from the
end of the season, the top teams are tun-
ing themselves for the post-season tour-
nament.

With two big victories in three days,
Warner Hall’s Court Cases has become
the top team in women’s basketball. On
Sunday, Court Cases beat the Subterra-
nean Devils, 43-13, as Becca Bates had
16 in the winning cause. Tuesday’s 18-
17 win over the previously undefeated
and number-one-ranked Old Ladies left
Court Cases as the only undefeated team
in women’s ball. Bates and Debbie
Podolin each had eight for the winners
while Kathy Gray had seven and Laura
Beck six for the Ladies.

The big upset in women’s league was
Cloud Nine’s 27-25 win over fifth-
ranked Shrieks at Midnight. Janet Bitter
led the girls from Fourth Rich with 15
while Shrieks was paced by Julie Kerr’s
13.

Men's B-league’s top two teams,
Champagne Jam and the Ubbies, clashed
for bragging rights in Division V and all
of B-league. Champagne Jam led the
whole way and managed to hold off a

‘late-game rally to win 37-36. Cham-
pagne Jam was aided by balanced scor-
ing from Jim Flaniken, Trey Jammes,
Ken Neal, Rob Asinger, and John
Hoffman while Ralph Steading had 13
for the Ubbies. Both teams will be highly
ranked in the post-season tournament.

The third-ranked Third Legs ex-

tended their record to 4-0 by beating
seventh-ranked Biff’s Yodeling Ogres
48-39 on Monday. John Hart's 18 and
Tyler Stoner’s 12 paced the Legs while
Biff’s was paced by Matt Newsom's 15.

These two teams could get a rematch
sometime in the tournament.

The sixth-ranked Collapsible Rims
remain undefeated after nipping Slam-
ming Seconds 29-28 on Tuesday. Pete
Burr hit two clutch free throws to seal the
win. Jim Kelly had 16 and Burr 10 to
pace the Rims while Darryl Bego had 11
for the Slammers.

The fourth-ranked Hot Rocks are
winning Division III after winning their
last encounter against All-Around Team
56-30. David Etheridge had 16 and
Robert Nesbit 12 as Hot Rocks went to 4-
0.

Division IV is paced by the Moores-
ville Walkers. The Walkers, who are
fifth-ranked, topped the eighth-ranked
Unmentionables 51-47. Chris Holden
pumped in 17 for the Walkers while
Mike Beard gunned for 13 for the Un-
mentionables. The Walkers have learned
to win without the services of Ted
Garner. Divison IV also has the ninth-
ranked Midnight Train and the 2-]
Women of Vietnam (led by a pseudo-
KA) to make life interesting.

End of the World continues to domi-
nate street hockey as it beat the Banana
Hammocks, 19-2, Bendecko’s II, 9-0,
and Gliques Glizzards, 10-0. Sedge
Gray, Mike Lufkin and company look
unstoppable as post-season action ap-
proaches.

Irresistable Force is the only team
that seems to have «. hope of catching End
of the World. Force beat Dominating
Bears, 6-1, the Cobras, 3-1, and Immov-
able Object, 3-1. The Force is paced by
Josh Buddle’s scoring, Edwin Page’s
goaltending, and Rick Link’s defense.

Though the Cobras, Dominating and Im-
movable Object might disagree, the
championship should eventually pair the
incredible scoring power of End of the
World and the defense of Irresistable
Force to decide Davidson’s best street
hockey team.
