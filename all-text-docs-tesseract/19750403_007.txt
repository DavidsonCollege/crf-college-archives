Rheinberger organizes intense sounds

G@lassical

By CARL SCHWARTZ
Staff Writer

Josef Gabriel Rheinberger
(1839-1901) was one of the more
prolific composers of the
nineteenth century.

He was a native of Liechten-
stein and spent most of his life
teaching at the conservatory in

.Munich where his many
Students included Horatio
Parker, a well known if not
terribly outstanding American
composer.

Rheinberger’s music has en-
joyed some popularity, mostly
in Europe. His twenty Organ
Sonatas were the craze during
the early part of this century
and are still occasionally heard
today.

There have been many
judgements made about this
composer’s music, right now
the scales are tipped against
him due to the general anti-
romantic sentiment in music
circles prevalent for the last
quarter of a century or so.

There can be no doubt that he
is overshadowed by his famous
contemporaries, Brahms and
Wagner. His music is far less
intense and shares the easy-
going sounds native to southern
Germany so typical of Johann
Strauss. .

Rheinberger was capable of
one thing that eluded his con-
temporaries: he understood the
organ well enough to join its
forces with the orchestra.
While both are allowed to shine
out in individual splendor, they
complement each dther per-
fectly.

Only a handful of composers
have been able to achieve this:
Haydn who created the
classical Organ Concerto,
Mozart who perfected it, Rhein-
berger who adapted it to
romantic ends, and in the twen-
tieth century, Joseph Jongen
whose. Symphonic Concertante
has been hailed as a master-
piece by many.

E. Power Biggs, the Colum-
bia Symphony and conductor
Maurice Peress have joined
forces in a new Columbia
recording (M-32297) featuring
both of Rheinberger’s concerti,
one in F major for Organ,
String Orchestra and Horns
(Opus 137, 1884) and the other
in G minor adding trumpets
and tympani to the orchestral
forces (Opus 177, 1894).

The works are built in a
traditional fashion, with a
serious but energetic  in-
troductory movement.

A gentle Andante which
builds to a fortissimo and dies
away again serves as an
elegant second movement and
the final movements, both
marked ‘‘con moto’’, polish off
the pieces with gusto.

trasting, always have a lyrical
quality and vital energy that
reminds me of the music of Ed-
ward Elgar; indeed, it has been
pointed out that Elgar’s
Enigma Variations used a
similar theme to one in the first
movement of the G minor con-
certo.

The handling of the musical
material is effective, the har-
monies colorful but not over-
bearing and there is ample
counterpoint for. interest. The
orchestration is thin in texture;
there is no Brahmsian mush
here. :

The organ is allowed to be an
organ instead of a one man or-
chestra which it is not.

The performances are ef-
fective enough; Bigg’s playing
is musical and sometimes out-
standing, his _ registration
varies from tolerable to. awful,
but the organ is at fault most of
the time, it is not only clear but
downright shrill choruses. The
conductor seems unable to

coordinate the organ and in-
dividual groups of instruments
very well.

This does not become serious
until critical moments in the
music when everything falls
apart. This is understandable
in that this orchestra is not a
group that regularly works-
together, but the result is not
musically acceptable. At least
the music ‘“‘comes off”’.

The recorded sound is decent
if not impressive, and the sur-
faces are quiet. This recording
is a noble effort on the part of
Columbia, Biggs and Peress to
revive Rheinberger’s music
and until a tighter performance
is.recorded this is the only one
available.

past five years, she has moved
beyond their influence into her
own special realm of emotional,
romantic and highly inventive
keyboard style.

Her explorations of harmony
and counterpoint, a steady beat
that sets the outer limits for the
song, and the improvisation of
new musical phrases result in a
round dimension of jazz swing.
