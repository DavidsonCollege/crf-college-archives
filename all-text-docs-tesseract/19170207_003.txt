WEEKLY MEETINGS:

In the Philanthropic Society Saturday
night the question, “Resolved, That the
policy of non-resistance should be adopt-
ed by the United States,” was discussed.
The affirmative was upheld by Cum-
ming, Foscue and Worth; the negative
by McDonald, Roberts, Fleming and
Boney.

The affirmative contended that non-
resistance meant that the United States
should not carry on aggressive warfare.
In this way they would win the friend-
ship of the other nations, and better
maintain peace. The negative contend-
ed that non-resistance was a folly at the
present time, that resistance was neces-
sary to our defence. The negative won
the decision.

Owing to the cold weather, there
was no meeting of the Phi society last
Monday morning.

Saturday night in the Fumenean so
ciety the question, “Resolved. That a
policy of non-resistance should be adopt
ed by the United States.” was unheld on
the affirmative by McCloy. Allen and
McGirt. on the: negative by Morton,
Fraser and Love.

The affirmative spent the most of its
time painting the horrors of war. One
of the best points brought out by them.
however, was that in the ward “policy”
was meant that the United States would
make it her rule not to resist all petty
disoutes and insults and to go to war
only as a last resort.

The negative contended that non-re-
sistance is impracticahle—being con-
trary to human nature; that it is mor-
ally wrong—causing other nations to
infringe upon our rights and making us
submit to worse evils than war, and that
it would cause our economic ruin. ‘Both
the societv and the judges decided in
favor of the negative.

FIRE. IN WATTS BUILDING
SATURDAY NIGHT

At 7:30 Saturday night a large blaze
was noticed in No. 1 Watts. Hurried
investigation proved it to he the begin-
ning of what might have been a disas-
trous fire, had an alarm not been spread,
which called a number of students to
the burning room. The regular oc-
cupants of the room were away at the
time, but many of those who assembled
there brought with them vessels of
water, with which they made quick
work of the matter.

The floor in that part of the room
was completely charred. The bureau,
a trunk, and considerable clothing, prob-
ably including a suit, were destroyed.

DR. D. H. ROLSTON
ADDRESSES Y. M. C. A.

Dr, D. H. Rolston, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Charlotte.
was the speaker at the Y. M. C. A.
meeting on last Thursday night, and his
topic was “The Book of Hebrews.”
The speaker began by giving a short
outline of the history of the book, its
authorship, message, etc. He next de-
voted a few minutes to a discussion of
the purpose of the book, stating that it
was to serve to encourage and confirm
the Christians who had renounced Juda-
ism for the new faith. He gave the
“key word” as that admonition of the
author to “hold fast.” this expression
being eanivalent to “steadfast” and
patience.” The next point discussed
was the application of the message of
the book to the Christian Church of to-
dav to hold fast to its calling and its
faith in the face of modern materialism
and indifference.

For a few minutes at the opening of
the meeting FE. H. Hamilton briefly out-
lined the history. scope and purposes of
the Pocket Testament League and an-
nounced the becinning of a canvass for
pledges to the league.

TESTAMENT CAMPAIGN

Last Sunday night a campaign was
heguin by the Ministerial Band, to put

League before every student at David-

ing at least a chapter each day. A few
of these men already belonged to the
league, but the majority are newly en-
listed.

The Pocket Testament League is a
