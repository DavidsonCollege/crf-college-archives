... Courtwatch

(Continued from page 3)
Griffin Defends

Griffin told this reporter, *‘I
don’t. know anyone better
qualified on the list of
nominees for the post than
Allie Burnette.’’

The courtwatch report
proposes that magistrates be
granted higher pay to attract
persons with higher
qualifications, and recom-
mends that higher
qualifications for the office of
magistrate be established.*

The only qualification of a
Mecklenburg Co. Magistrate
is that he or she be .able to
type, according to a Legal Aid
attorney who worked on the
report.

‘‘We are in agreement with
many of the report’s con-
clusions,’ Griffin added.

“We're going to get better
training. We have lawyers

who are interested in teaching
them ... We do need higher
pay.

“You know, she’s got a
tough ‘job, and you couldn’t
pay me $50,000 to take that
jo Hibs

When asked whether a law
should be passed to require
the magistrate to inform the
defendant of his right to ap-
peal, Griffin said, ‘‘I don’t
think it’s the job of the
magistrate to have to give
them (defendant of plaintiff)
their right to appeal.

“] didn’t make good grades,
but even in high school I knew
about the right to appeal ...
The act of appealing is what’s
running up court costs. That’s
why we’re overcrowded.”’

The report concludes that
methods of<accountability
should be built into the
magistrate’s courts, perhaps
making them courts of record
(using a stenographer) or
requiring periodic ob-
servations by the chief district
court judge.

When ‘asked whether he
believed the magistrates’

. court should be a court of
record, Griffn said, ‘Heavens

no, we’re trying to keep the.

costs down for the benefit of
taxpayers. «
“If we were to work the way
|

the report wants us, -the
magistrates’: court would be
better staffed than the district
courts.”’ ;

Purpose and Procedure

The purpose of the report is
“to ascertain from’ . ob-
servation of the Civil
Magistrates’ Court’ in
operation whether the
presiding magistrates were
performing their duties in at-
cordance with the law and the
interests of justice, and to in-
form the public and respon-
sible officials of our con-
clusions.’ “

Each of the observers who
wrote affidavits underwent a
training program. Two at-
torneys for the ACLU who had
handled cases in the small
claims court conducted the
program.

The attorneys explained the
elements of the substantive
law of contract, summary
ejectment, and the
requirements for jurisdiction

_ of the Magistrate Court.

The’ observers were also
shown the procedure for ob-

taining and examining ‘files .

related to the cases held in
magistrate’s court.

Burnette has already been
nominated for her second two-
year term as magistrate but
remains to be confirmed.

Dana Awards $200,000

The Charles.A. Dana Foun-
dation has’ given a $200,000
grant to Davidson to baer
Dana Science’ Building,
College Président Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. announced Wed-
nesday.

The new Dana grant will
allow completion of two 1000-
square-foot laboratories, a
1500-square-foot student

z=: research laboratory, a science

museum, several special work
areas for handling radio-
isotopes and _ research
animals, an equipment-
preparation room, a seminar
room, storage, and auxiliary
facilities on the third floor of
the Dana Science Building.
“One fourth of our student

body are now biology or —

premedical majors, and so
this Dana gift is extremely im-
portant and deeply ap-
preciated,”’ said Chairman of
the Biology Department
Donald Kimmel.

“The traditional teaching of
biology in the classrooms, sup-

plemented by ‘cookbook’
laboratory sessions, is
becoming outdated. To

prepare our students in the
best manner, we must give
them the facilities and equip-
ment to conduct more_in-
dividual research,’ Kimmel
added. ,

Terry summarized his
feelings about the symposium.
“I was disappointed that the
attendance wasn’t any better
cy it was, although it wasn’t
’ “T was particularly disap-
pointed that there wasn’t
more faculty interest. There
were about 15 people at the
faculty meeting with Powell,
and the majority were ones
who already have the con-
cerns and know the prob-
lems,”’ he said.

Terry emphasized | that
students have to work out
much of the problem them-
selves--internally. However,
he believes that the sym-
posium has helped dispel
some of the myths that have
grown up about academic
pressure.

“Pressure is. a very
visceral, emotional kind of
feeling and we all discussed it
on the must abstract and in-
tellectual terms. This is the
pattern that we use in most of
ae discussions,”’ Terry ad-

led.
