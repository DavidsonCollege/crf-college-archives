Dean of the Honors Center
Earl R. MacCormac announced
at the intermission of the Wed-
nesday Carolina Inn film that
he will begin seeking actively
the presidency of Davidson
College.

MacCormac repeated the an-
nouncement at the close of the
film in order to get some
response.

“The College needs
desperately a concentrated ef-
fort at fund raising. Some
forethought must be directed
toward our future.

“I. have presented
numerous occasions a five year
plan of development. Yet, they
have never taken me seriously.
They keep telling me to put up
or shut-up!”’

When asked about the timing
of his candidacy, MacCormac
said the College’s immediate
future would demand a
‘dynamic leader.

“T’m the best handball player
on campus, you know. Honestly,
it really wasn’t my idea to an-
nounce, but I just got so excited
thinking about it!’

Jean Daughtry piped in that
she had always admired Loyce
Davis’ desk.

MacCormac feels that his
recent appointment to the
Board of Directors at First

‘Union Bank demonstrates his

on

familiarity with. the financial
community.

“Reports say the College will
need $15 million in the next few
years. The money is out there. I

could get it.”

A frequent critic of President
Samuel R. Spencer, Mac-
Cormac said, “I think a.
President should be tall. By the
way, I think white fences are
tacky.”

MacCormac contended that
his role as dean of the Honors
Center has demonstrated his
administrative capabilities.
“‘We are now nurturing one of
the best young librarians in the
country. I think he would make
an excellent assistant to the
President.”

Other changes would be likely
if MacCormac does acheive the
Presidency. ‘‘The administra-
tion is supposed to serve
the community. As my good
friend Shaw Smith says, I’m not
here to build walls; I’m here to
move them,

. “Besides, if I were President,
Naney and I could run this
damn town!”’

As president, MacCormac
plans to spend one half of his
time fund raising and one: half
on research. MacCormac con-
fided that he plans to give sur-
prise guest lectures in various
fields in order to raise the
faculty’s morale.

“TI have carried Davidson
College’s academic reputation
long enough. All my students

say I’ve given enough to
academics. I am tired of low
faculty salaries. I want to be an
administrator.’’

MacCormac pointed out that
the College’s reputation is very
high when one considers our
non-publishing, stagnant
faculty, “I think the tenure
system agravates this
problem. As President, I could
really get dippy departments,
like those Mathematics clowns,
to get moving.

“The first thing we need to do

is to move the Philosophy

department to the first floor. I
think that Davidson would also
have much more class if all
publicity releases were hen-
ceforth done in metaphors.”’
MacCormac feels that he
could improve the College’s
Christian Commitment. ‘‘I
think I could bring God back to
Davidson. It may take a lot of
money, though. Did you know

that Spencer never even went to

divinity school?”’

MacCormac also expressed
concern about the energy crisis.

‘As. the financial situation
progresses, we may have to
rethink our commitment to the
Presbyterians. I think in a few
years we will see a significant
increase in the number of small
liberal arts colleges with an
Islamic bent.”’

MacCormac refused to name
an heir to his position as Dean of
the Honors Center.-He did
volunteer that, “If Ed White
and those people can’t turn

Spencer Smashes Net Returns

from tennis to handball, they
might have to go elsewhere.”’
MacCormac also refused to

* comment on speculation that

plans are being drawn to in-
crease the enrollment of the
Honors Center to 800 in case his
bid for the Presidency fails.

He categorically denied that
he had ever thought of moving
Davidson to California.

When asked how long he
planed to stay at Davidson,
MacCormac looked bewildered.
“T used to think that one could
see the world from a depart-
mental chairmanship. I don’t
think that is true anymore.

“Pride is something I pride
myself on. I really thought that
I was much more impressive
than Fred Harris.’”’

MacCormac Announces Candidacy

Spencer Wins Tourney
With Sight Backhand

By WILSON HAMSTRING
Staff Writer

Gollege President Samuel R.

‘Spencer Jrraised nothing but a
‘few eyebrows Wednesday when

he easily won the National In-
vitational Tennis Tournament

’ For College Presidents and/or

Fund Raisers and then refused
to accept his prize money.

The tournament is co-
sponsored each year by the
Mudd Foundation and the
National Endowment For the’
Arts, and although the exact
purse is kept a secret, it is
rumored to be in the neigh-
borhood.of enough to remodel a
chemistry building and ef-
fectively convert a rarely used
dining hall into an art gallery.

The refusal of prize money by
Spencer caused some _in-
dignation among his fellow
college presidents.

“I wish I could turn down
grants like that. He must be sit-
ting on a pile somewhere.” said
Queens College President R.
Moore Carr.

When reached for comment
Spencer. answered, slowly and
with a assured grin on his face:
‘Money is tight right now. I
didn’t. want any.”’

When pressed further Spen-
cer said: ‘‘I feel that the tennis
tournament was not run
properly. It-was a racket with
strings attached.”

Spencer won the tournament
with 6-0, 6-0, 6-0 scores in the
finals! His serve was
devastating, and although it.
had tremendous power behind
it, Spencer’s delivery was sly,

Williams.

An interested bystander, for-
mer Vice President of Finance
and Development at Davidson
C. David Cornell said, ‘‘I knew
if anybody ever got tennis and
fund-raising together, Spencer
would be tough. His love for and
dedication to tennis is very
great.”’

The foundations who spon-
sored the tournament were a lit-
tle miffed at Spencer’s refusal.
In an effort to maintain good
will, however, the foundations
agreed to give the money to
Spencer’s favorite charity.

Tournament Chairman Henry
R. Beansworthy said “We area
new tournament and having our
money refused by the first win-
ner was a jolt. We tried to con-
vince him that everybody needs
money but he just smiled. He
must be sitting on a real pile.

“‘We decided to contribute the
money to Spencer’s favorite
charity but there was really no
need to found a national group
to lobby for Women’s Sufferage
in Congress. We finally gave the
money to the Mecklinberg
Presbytery . I believe they are
going to use it to reclaim
Scotland.’’ continued Bean-
sworthy..

Vice President for Finance
for Davidson, Craven E.
Williams deplored Spencer’s
refusal.

“T think we could have used
that money. Any money is
useful, but that was so much
money. I’m still trying to ‘gét
my bearings .and learn about
this. school though.’’ said ©
