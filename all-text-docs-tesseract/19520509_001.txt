Regional YRC

Lining Burnet, Greensboro sopho-
more, was elected college director
of the Region Four Young Repub-
lican Organization at a recent mect-
ing of the YRS in Greensboro.

Tad Currie, junior from Kalama-
z00, Michigan, was elected treas-
urer of the organization.

Burnet, who drafted the con-
atitution for the regional organ-
ization, has the job of making
an effective organization of the
college Young Republican Clubs
in Region Four.

He was elected by representa-
tives of college YRC’s in the region
which includes Georgia, South
Carolina, North Carolina, Tennes-
see, and Florida.

To accomplish his work of
integrating and co-ordinating
the Region Four Young Re-
publican clubs, Burnet will be
allowed a liberal expense ac-
count from the Young Repub-
lican Federation, a national or-
ganization.

“The Republican party has be-
come disturbed over the lack of
support of the young people in the
last few years,” said Burnet. “They
are now making a conscious effort
to convince the first-voters of the
country that the Republican party
is their best bet for the future.”

After 23 Years Of Her Silent Service
Miss Passmore Will Be Leaving Library

This August Davidson loses a per-
sonality second in familiarity only
to the chambermaids.
Pasmore, library circulation man-

ager, plans to retire just after sum- |:

Miss Julia] :2

mer school, There’s not much you | iz

can say about her that deserves 2-
inch headlines. Hers was not the
kind of work that calls for unveil-
ings and ceremonious display, For
she represents the thankless worker
behind the scenes, But had she not
done her many tasks promptly and
efficiently, the library would soon
have become inefficient and slovent.

Miss Pasmore has been with
D. C. since before most of us were
born. She came here after grad-
uating from W.-C. and teaching
Latin and math in her hometown
high school at Cary. She had taken
a library course in Philadelphia and
came directly to D.C. in 1929, At
that time the Hbrary was in the
present Guest House. There were
only 25,000 books then, and in her
23 years she has helped this num-
ber to grow to its present 57,000.
Ironically enough it is this in-
crease in volume of volumes that
is now forcing her retirement. “The
work is just becoming too heavy
and I couldn't carry on another
year. I suppose I'll move from Da-
vidson and try to get lighter work
elsewhere. I haven’t sent in any
applications as yet though.”

I asked her about the students,
“Oh, the boys haven't changed
much. Maybe they're a bit noiser.”
She realizes it’s an exceptional stu-
dent that goes through D.C, without
ever once being called down for
noise in the library. Many a student
has learned from Miss Pasmore the

high relationship between gold and
silence. And that is her only regret.
“I hope the Soys don’t think I was
too strict. I've enjoyed my work
here very much. Davidson is a great
college and I think a great deal
of you boys, but I hope they real-
ize I had to be strict at times.”
Dr. Davidson perhaps knows her

Scholarships

Last week it was announced that
four Davidson men of the class of
1952 had been awarded Morehead
Scholarships for graduate study at
the University of North Carolina.
Those receiving the grants for their
advanced studies were Wallace Ab-
bott, J. V. Hunter, Pete Katogridis,
and Bilt, White.

This announcement came after the
four, who were nominated by Da-
vidson College officials for the try-
outs, had undergone interviews on
two successive days at Chapel Hill
before the Morehead Scholarship
Committee. They were . selected
along with four others from a group
representing fourteen schools of
higher learning.

Three of the other scholar-
ship winners attend UNC while
the fourth is from Atlantic
Christian College in Wilson.
Thus one-half of the scholar-
ships awarded by John Motley
Morehead went to Davidson
men. Last year Sam Joyner and
Johnny Kelton became the first
Davidson men to win Morehead
Scholarships. They are current-
ly studying at the University.
Hunter, who is from Winston-

Salem, and Kalogridis, a product

of Winterhaven, Florida, will both

pursue studies in the field of law,
working for their LL.B. degrees.

They both expect to be at the
University for three years. Ab-
bott, who is from Kirkwood,
Missouri, and White, from near-

* by Charlotte, will be working
toward their Masters in Busi-
ness Administration, a course of
study requiring two yeare.

‘The scholarships consist of $1500

per year to aid the student while}

presented on merit and accomplish-
ment alone, not on financial need.
They are good for one year, to be
renewed if the holder's performance
is satisfactory. ,

Myers Edits Scripts N Pranks

Bulgin, Moylan
Out; Fick Says
New Man ‘Okay

Rising senior Mike Myers was
elected today editor of Scripts 'N
Pranks for next ycar in the two-
day student vote which eliminated
Mac Bulgin and Dave Moylan.

A Beta from Greensboro, N. C.,
Mike is, in the words of Jim Fick-
eisen, the departing editor, “Very
well qualified and probably will
bring a lot of new ideas into the
magazine. He will have a good staff
to help him.”

ad

In his speech in chapel Myers
backed the proposals entered
by Mac Bulgin for improve-
ment of the magazine. How-
ever, Mike diverged fom Bul-
gin’s line widely in saying he
wanted to make the magazine
a first class college humor
magazine,

He said also that all the serious
articles would not be cut, but that
there would be only two or three
an issue. “A good, clean humor
magazine; the kind you'd send to
your folks and girl friend,” were
Myers’ descriptive terms.

This increase means that the total

Professor Wilson stated that
every soldier must learn to
keep up his own morale. He
said he found the “Devotional
Diary’’ helpful in this purpose.
He advised learning to cat nap
during the occasional short rests
in order to keep physically
awake.

Dr. Workman stressed the dif-

phasized the necessity of knowing
how much responsibility to dele-
gate to others. ;

In the concluding address Chap-

Davidson is losing a loyal worker. lain Nolan outlined the importance

of faith in one’s self, faith in coun-
try, ‘and faith in God and their
importance for becoming a success-
ful leader in the armed forces.

Opportunity was given for the
students to ask questions and to
talk personally with the various
leaders after the close of the re-
treat. Al Davis led a worship serv-
ice at the beginning of the retreat
and distributed special copies of The
Intercollegian about “Facing Mili-
tary Service” to all in attendance at
the meeting.

Chaplain

Resigns

After Short Stay

Alan G. Gripe has announced
that he will resign fis post as
College Chaplain this summer.

Mr. Gripe came to this cam-
pus only last summer, but
found that the work was not
to his liking and felt it his duty
to explore the field of Chris-
tian student work more
thoroughly. For this purpose
he will journey to Europe to
work’ in an Ecumenical Work

Camp in Germany this summer.

Mr. Gripe was active in the Y
and other phases of campus life,
and many will regret to sce him
and Mrs. Gripe leave,

The college never before had a
man serving in the capacity of
chaplain, but it was hoptd that Mr.
Gripe would fill an essential spot
in the religious chain of command
and solve some of the eternal prob-
lems that confront members of the

SVM Presents

‘hh His Hands’

The Student Volunteer Move-
ment for Christian Missions, a re-
cently formed Christian organiza-
tion on the campus, will present at
vespers Sunday night a play en-
titled “In His Hands.” This play,
written by Archie Crouch, is about
the Korean Church's response to
need in the present Korean war.

It is based on the personal ex-
perience of a Korean Christian
Church pastor named ‘Pastor
Kim,” and it is to be presented to
the Davidson student body in ‘order
that they may form a clearer pic-
ture of Christian actions in Korea
today.

This play, directed by Mr.
ahd Mrs. Alan Gripe at David-
son, was also presented at the
Sixteenth Quadrennial Confer-
ence of the Student Volunteer
Movement held in Kansas dur-
ing the past Christmas vaca-
tion. At that time, three Da-
vidson students acted in the
play.

The leading male role will be
played by Stuart Plummer of Da-
vidson, who will ‘be opposite Miss
Nan Breyman. The several girls’
parts in the play will be played by
Queens girls.

Since the play will be presented
at vespers, it is requested that
there be no clapping during or
after the performance of the play.

PETITION

The following petition will be submitted to the faculty of
Davidson College, signed by students below. Write The Davidsonian
or see Student Body President Jack Ruth to express your opinion

on the matter. (Ed Note.)

We, the undersigned, do hereby petition the faculty
of Davidson College for at least a three-day holiday between
the end of the last: examination of the first semester ex-
amination period and the beginning of the first day of
classes of the second semester for the college year 1952-1953.

Qur reasons are as follows:

1. Ie is highly desirable and not unreasonable to have
a brief rest period after examinations, which have never been
known to have been easy at Davidson College.

2. A break will also benefit the faculty, giving them
more time to grade exams and prepare final grades. and

also a few days for rest.
3.

Better work and more enthusiasm from student and

professor alike would result at the beginning of the second

semester from such action.

dents, YMCA Cabinet, ODK, Phi Beta Kappes, Who's

Revised Catalogue
With New Features
Makes Appearance

Under the editorship of Dr. Sam
Spencer, the Davidson College
catalogue has undergone a complete
change including the cover, type,
paper, and size. The book, which
came in yesterday, contains 160
pages to last year’s 146, and many
features, such as illustrations in
photography, have been added:

At the head of every chapter are
scratchboard illustrations which
eniphasize the traditions and past
of Davidson. These were done by
Vrodie Brown of Charlotte.

The cover and typography
were done by Bill Mitchell of
the Dowd Press, which printed
the book in a type face called
Garamount. The last page of
the book is a map drawn by
Don Mahy of the Davidson stu-
dent body. Extra copies of this
map were made to help in
showing prospective students
around the campus.

KA’s, Roper Win
Frat Singing Cups

The Kappa Alpha Fraternity sang
their way into the first place of the
interfraternity sing last night under
the leadership of Howard Proctor.

Mr, Joe Little of the Charlotte
record shop bearing his name, stated
that the choice was very close, since
all fraternities were both original
and well balanced in their singing,
but the KA’s won on their having
not only: good voices well united,
but also on having a larger degree
of originality and entertainment in
their show.

Equally as important as the

KA win was the fact that

Charles Roper of the Sigma

won the conductor’s trophy for

his skill in leading his songs-

Judges for the event were Rev-
