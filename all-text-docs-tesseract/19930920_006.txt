The Week in Washington
Senate passes Clinton's Service Plan

By Brett Marston
Even as NAFTA and health
care develop into political night-
mares for him, President Clinton
did see a modified version of a

tional Service Trust program,
which will provide for scholar-
ships of up to $4,725 for about
100,000 students who choose to
perform local community service

dream fulfilled recently as the Sen-
ate approved the $1.6 billion Na-

for a year.
Under this new plan, which

opportunity to pay off college loans by serving the public.

NOTES

A rising tide that lifts all boats?

“In an anemic economy, growth is a perfectly understandable
objective. Only the very envious would find comfort in an economy
lin which everyone was getting poorer--but the rich at the fastest rate.
\ But growth is not always a rising tide that lifts all boats. After all, the
| 1980s saw a spurt in inequality notwithstanding the longest peacetime
j economic expansion since the Second World War. The one mitigating
factor--the factor that perhaps keeps a lid on public discontent over the
increasingly unequal division of earnings--is mobility. Americans
seem willing to tolerate wide gaps between rich and poor so long as
they view the door of opportunity as open.”

-From the September 11 edition of The National Journal.

The demand for drugs

“Ultimately...we only fool ourselves if we think this nation’s drug
problems can be solved in foreign lands. Americans wantillicit drugs-
-and so far too many people have so little to lose that they’re willing
to risk arrest and imprisonment in order to peddle those drugs or to get
high. Unless we figure out how to curtail demand in this country, we’ re
guaranteed to fail everywhere else.”

-From the editorial in the September 17 edition of the Raleigh

News and Observer

Attaching strings to money

“Republicans may be devoted, as they say they are, to the cause
of decentralization and increased power for the states. But in the
Reagan era, they all too often used ‘federalism’ as a cover for simply
cutting federal funds and letting states fend for themselves. Mr.
Clinton is obviously no enemy of federal spending, yet he also believes
in giving more authority to the states. This gives him a chance to get
Congress and the nation’s governors talking plainly to each other
about how many strings Washington needs to attach to its money.”

-From the editorial in the September 17 edition of The

Washington Post

Disproving oppression and murder

“The end of the Cold War has liberated us in more ways than we
might have thought, liberated us from the tyranny of Communism and
liberated us to reexamine the liberalism that is now triumphant. For
more than half a century, confronted with the double threat of Nazism
and Communism, the urgent problem facing us was: How can
liberalism defend itself against totalitarianism? How cana society that
is individualistic, pluralistic, pacific, devoted to private pleasures and
domestic tranquility, prevail against an enemy that is collectivist,
authoritarian, militaristic, [and} mobilized for power and conquest?
The defeat of Nazism and the collapse of the Soviet empire have
conclusively proved that totalitarianism is not only oppressive and
murderous; it is inefficient and fatally vulnerable.”

-From an article by Gertrude Himmelfarb entitled “Liberty:

One very simple principle?” and appearing in the Autumn edition of
The American Scholar

will become law on October 1st,
individuals aged 17 or older will
also receive federally funded sti-
pends from local service programs,
as well as health and child care.
Students will be eligible to
receive the money for work in vari-
ous state and non-profit organiza-
tions, such as local hospitals, po-
lice departments, and local Red

* Cross chapters. Groups such as

Teach for America and Habitat for

. Humanity will also benefit from

this package.

Mr. Eli Segal, who heads the
Office of National Service, hopes
that the new federal programs will
be ready by next June, and that
participants will start work in Sep-
tember, according to the Christian
Science Monitor.

In addition, as of the 1994-95
school year, students who borrow
from the government will be able
torepay new college loans accord-
ing to a percentage of their level of
income after graduation, instead
ofin pre-determined monthly pay:
ments.

Supporters of the plan hope
that this will encourage more
graduates to work in service-ori-
ented jobs, which usually pay less
money than jobs in business and
industry.

The final version of the pack-
age is much smallerthan Clinton’s
original proposal, which would
have cost more than twice as much
and provided up to $10,000 in
scholarship money for a year of
service.

Newsweek reports that as the
Administration tries to slim down
the budget, some educators feared
that Clinton’s plan would reduce
the number of Pell grants, which
enable over four million needy stu-
dents to attend college.

Senate Republicans com-
plained that the leaner version of
the bill is still too expensive, at a
cost of about $16,000 a year per
student. Pell grants cost the gov-
ernment $1,300a year per student.

Senator Slade Gorton, R-
Wash., attacked the bill as “an-
other almost open-ended new
spending program,” as quoted in

_ the Congressional Quarterly.

The bill which the Senate ap-
proved does cap spending at $300
million for fiscal 1994, $500 mil-
lion for 1995, and $700 million for
1996.

Although he supports the idea
of the plan, Gordon Peck, Associ-
ate Dean of Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid here at Davidson, has
some reservations about providing
monetary rewards forservice work.
Indeed, this was one of the main
criticisms of the plan since its be-
ginning.

“Tt may push students who are
borderline into considering service
options,” says Peck. According to
Peck, a consortium of schools has
pledged to match federal service
money with money of their own.
All but four Democrats in the Sen-
ate supported the bill, and all but
six Republicans opposed it. Sena-
tors Helms, Faircloth, Hollings,
Thurmond, and Coverdell all voted
against the bill. Senator Nunn from

_ Georgia voted for it,

Somalia: time to rethink
Operation Restore Hope?

By Gautam Srinivasan
In December of 1992, the
United States sent troops into So-

malia. Their goal was to help alle-:

viate the famine that griped the
country and threatened much of
the population. The mission, am-
bitiously entitled Operation Re-
store Hope, was also supposed to
calm the anarchy loosed upon the
country by the many warring fac-
tions.

The troops landed with no re-
sistance and soon controlled the
major cities in Somalia. Food dis-
tribution lines were opened and
the good will mission seemed to be
a success. President Bush even
indicated that our troops may come
home before the new year.

Nearly ten months later, how-
ever, U.S. troopsare still in Soma-
lia along with other members of a
United Nations peacekeeping
force. Violence is again common-
place as members of the peace-
keeping force are subject to attack
by Somali gunmen. What has hap-
pened to so drastically the situa-
tion? The answer is, of course,
complex, but we may look at one
key factor.

One reason has to do with the
mission itself. While relieving the
famine was an obvious goal, the
aim as far as the political situation
was more ambiguous. From the
outset, no definite strategy was
devised to deal with the roving
bands of gunmen controlled by
Somalia’s warlords. The U, S.
seemed to play the situation by ear,
not quite sure what to expect.

The situation took a dramatic
turn early this summer when 23
Pakistani peacekeepers were killed
in an ambush. The attackers were

purportedly followers of General
Mohammad Farah Aidid, one of
the most powerful Somali war-
lords.

The U.N. painted Aidid as the
chief obstacle to resolving the po-
litical crisis and consequently
focused its efforts on getting him
out of the way. The peacekeepers
attacked Aidid’s headquarters in
attempts to capture or kill him.
These efforts not only failed but
served to turn the Somali people
against the peacekeepers, The situ-
ation has become increasingly
murkier with the passage of time.

Many in Congress have now
begun to question U. S. involve-
ment in Somalia. The lack of a
clear policy has hurt the American
effort. In the minds of many, it is
uncertain when, and under what
conditions, U.S. troops may return
home. The possibility of a drawn-
out U. S. presence leaves many in
Congress with cold feet.

Indeed, the critical question
may now be ‘why are U. S. troops
in Somalia?’ One could argue that
the United States has completed its
goal. The famine and starvation
that brought the U. S. to Somalia
is, for all practical purposes, over.

The malnutrition rate among
children under five years old has
dropped from 60% to 10%. The
mission has lost focus and appears
to be going nowhere fast. The
peacekeepers have lost the support
of the Somali people and are now
the subject of frequent attacks.
Even armed with the best inten-
tions, is it possible to help a nation
that apparently wants no help?

With no end in sight, it may be
time to rethink the United State’s
commitment in Somalia.
