WASHINGTON, D.C.-- Representa-
tives of Philip Morris Companies, Inc. hon-
ored Davidson with a grant of $100,000 for
campus diversity on September 22.

The company sponsored program, “Tol-
erance on Campus: Establishing Common
Ground,” presented honors to 11 colleges
and universities. chosen to participate.

The $100,000 grant for each school isto
be used at the colleges and universities in
implementing programs to promote a cli-
mate of understanding and respect for diver-
sity on campuses nationwide.

In attendance at the luncheon for the
presentation of honors on Capitol Hill in

Washington were officers of the 11 col-
leges, members of Congress and representa-
tives of a number of civil rights organiza-
tions. Davidson was selected with 10 other
schools by a panel of national educators,
civil rights leaders, and philanthropists.
The application pool included over 60

colleges and universities. Selection was

based on the innovative and thoughtful ap-
proaches to the problems of campus diver-
sity. Davidson’s efforts to promote diver-
sity through educational environment was
the basis for selection.

Conscious of the value of acommunity
with diverse racial and cultural heritages,
the school will advance an institutional goal

of creating a campus environment receptive
to an increasingly diverse student popula-
tion. Specifically, Davidson promotes di-
versity and inclusiveness through the Sum-
mer Bridge Program for minority students
to become acquainted with the Davidson
campus; and a new Minority Counselor to
address the concerns of minority students.
A minority cultural series to highlight
the accomplishments of minority artists and
integrate their work into the cultural life of
the college; Diversity Seminars to orient the
campus with multicultural activities; and
Leadership Interns to provide minority stu-
dents with an opportunity to work in an
academic environment are other Davidson

programs that encourage diversity.

Duke University was the only other
recipient of the grant from Philip Morris in
North Carolina.

The grant will be distributed over three
years as Davidson works to incorporate more
diversity-oriented programs.

President Kuykendall stated, “This grant
signals a truly unique opportunity for
Davidson as we continue to work for mutual
appreciation and understanding within a di- -
verse community.

"As we work to establish our own ‘com-
mon ground,’ it is reaffirming to know that
we have such a generous.show of support
from Philip Morris."

Forum looks
at Patterson
Court future

By Jenny Schroeter
On Monday, September 27,
the Campus Forum Committee
sponsored a forum discussing the
future of Patterson Court. The
forum consisted of four senior pan-
elists from various groups. About

fifty students turned out for the
meeting.

These panelists included in-
dependent ‘Brett Marston, BSC
member Phiderika Foust, Phi Delt
president Myles Louria, and Patter-
son Court and Conner House presi-
dent Julie Petty. The moderator of
the event was Jason Bertsch, chair-
man of the Campus Forum Com-
mittee.

Each of the panelists began
with an opening statement defin-
ing what Patterson Court means to
them. Following the opening state-
ments, panelists discussed specific
aspécts of Patterson Court.

The idea of expanding Patter-
son Court to ‘include other activi-
ties besides those usually associ-
ated with the court was an impor-
tant topic. More involvement of
independents in court activities was
another issue that was discussed.

After the discussion among

Officer Moore strikes a scary
pose as Terminaor X.

By Susan Warren

Police Officer Stanley Tho-
mas Moore, known around cam-
pus for his towering presence at
parties (he’s 6’8" 1/2 and 250
pounds), is more than just a
Davidson Police Officer. When
not enforcing the law at Davidson,
Officer Moore is a professional
wrestler in Mooresville.

Known as “Terminator X” in
the independent wrestling circuit,
Moore wrestles all over the East
Coast. Hehas been professionally
wrestling for the past two years
and wrestles whenever he can fit it
into his schedule.

To become a professional
wrestler, Moore says one must re-
ally have a great interest. Moore

went through a four month school
for three hours a day, four days a

week at the Ivan Koloff School of ©

Wrestling in Indian Trail, North
Carolina.

Moore wrestles indepen-
dently, with his next big match in
Winston Salem, North Carolinaon
October 23. This match is espe-
cially exciting because it will be
televised in the Winston Salem
area.

Inadditiontowrestling, Moore
coordinates and promotes the tour-
nament held in Mooresville. This
means hiring wrestlers and setting
up ring time. Moore would love to
go "big time," but for now he's
happy to be a policeman by day
and Terminator X by night.

THIS WEEK

ROTC Blood

drive falls
short of goals

By Court McBryde

The ROTC Blood Drive was
held Wednesday, September 29, in
the Morrison Room of the Union.
This year’s goal was 125 units of
blood, but only 107 units were
donated.

ROTC Junior Matt McKinney
chaired the Blood Drive.

ROTC service society called the
Sabbard and Blade. Sabbard and
Blade took over the Blood Drive
five years ago as a service project.
Previously, ROTC did sponsor
Blood Drives, but not on a regular
basis. ROTC sponsors two blood
drives a year: fall and spring.
This fall’s drive welcomed
Davidson students, faculty, and
community. “Even retired faculty
gave blood,” said McKinney. In
preparation for the drive, flyers
and posters were hung around cam-
pus and at the post office.
McKinney contacted five area
churches to make an announce-
ment about the drive. However,
despite the preparations made the
turn out was less than expected.
McKinney feels this particu-
lar blood drive was rushed due to
short notice from the Red Cross
which might have precipitated the
“O.K. turn out.” Major Hawkins
explained that Red Cross’s calen-
dar filled up fast and this was the
only time when their staff could
come. He added, “It was almost
too short of notice.”
