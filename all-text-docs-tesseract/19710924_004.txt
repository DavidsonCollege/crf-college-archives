Pomp And Circumstance

A friend recently told us of a dream, or rather a night-
mare, that he suffers through each fall while at Davidson.
It seems that in his vision he pictures himself standing in
a large room watching a long string of elegant robes funnel
the air as they move with great pomp in directionless cir-
cles, finally collapsing like broken umbrellas into hundreds
of stuffy seats.

Our friend’s dream, of course, is his own graphic illus-
tration of that orgy of self-adulation which Davidson con-
ducts each fall—the annual convocation. Costing much, en-
tertaining and educating few. and attended by a miniscule
representation of students, the convocation in its present
form needs to be drastically studied and reinterpreted.

The whole attitude taken towards the convocation has
come io rest on the principles of 19th century academia.
Rather than presenting the community and its visitors
with a real opportunity to think and breath and evaluate
the vullege role, as such educational ventures shoulc the
cotiege’s “fall ball” has become a time when matte s of
abstract academic philosophy are expounded upon mid
the symbols of traditional education.

Of course. this is the avowed purpose of convoc
and 3o the event serves its purpose well. It is this pur
however, that we call into question, for Davidson Co ege
should expand beyond the mere academic experience, and
if concerned with symbols, then its convocations should
symbolize this supra-academic awareness and concern of
the college community.

This whole tate of things is that much more distressing
when one considers the potential of such a venture. The
idea behind Davidson’s convocations is a sound one: bring-
ing together (a literal translation of the Latin ‘“‘convoco’’)
the various and diverse elements of the college communi-
ty to acknowledge the accomplishments of the college. But
a boring routine of perfunctory speeches and traditional
honors does little for college community.

Why not bréak some of the tradition, and transform
convocational hours into meaningful educational exper-
iences of honest dialogue for students within the context
of the college community? Indeed, why not ask a student,
or even one of the more articulate members of the faculty
or maintenance staff, to deliver the address?

Davidson College should keep its convocation; how-
ever, it should keep it interesting and worthwhile and
“relevant.”

A Word About Sex

It’s refreshing to have an important administration
official like Vice President Bevan speak out clearly on
the issue of coeducation. In the past there has been a
tendency for college officials to simply mutter something
about “certainly something we would want to investigate.”

We believe that there are several points which Be-

ion,
se,

van has made which give a very accurate picture of the |

status of coeducation at Davidson. b

Speaking from his own area of expertise Bevan has
gone on record as saying that academically there is no
reason that he can see for further delay in coeducation
if that is the course which Davidson decided to take. In
the past this has been offered as a hedge by some mem-
bers of the administration when the issue has been raised.

The two key points which Bevan made, we feel, are
the analysis of the role of single sex schools and his sum-
maration of the present climate at Davidson.

The Women’s Lib movement has made the academic
world particularly aware of some of its preconseptions
about the academic capabilities and intentions of men and
women. No longer is a finishing school for women easily
justified, nor is an all male school which has two ajid
three man deparemtnts in sociology and fine arts. |

It it tradition which stands behind sexual segrega-
tion of students, not academic concerns. It is not a ques-
tion as much as what Davidson can offer to women stu-
dents as what Davidson can offer to any student. With
the school’s selective enrollment and limited resources,
it will necesessarily appeal to a small group of either sex.

The most telling point of the Bevan interview, how-
ever, lies in the question of initiative. Coeducation has ap-
proval in principle from the trustees, it remains for the
administration and faculty to come up with a_ suitable
plan. It is most disappointing to regard the total lack of
initiative which has been shown by the administration,
coeducation will not suddenly appear unless we move off
our tragitional center.

I Never Cared

For Roast Lamb

“I never much cared for
roast lamb, but I always rather
enjoyed the mint jelly,’ she
said, licking her fingers.

That's the first absurd thing
I overhead at The Hub the
other day. Here’s what else I
heard:

I heard somebody from Cor-
nelius who said the story go
ing around down there is that
two years ago when there was
a fire in Duke Dormitory
the firemen couldn’t even get
into the doors ‘‘because of all
the nekkid girls who came run-
ning out of there.”

They also thought that beer
and cocktails are sold in frat
houses and the Union every
day before dinner. I knew this
just couldn’t be true, because
one of our good trustees told
me that ‘alcohol is the devil
in liquid form” and that I am
a “commie rat’ for being op-
posed to ROTC.

I also heard that while some
faculty members virtually went
begging for houses in Davidson
this summer, the College rent-
ed out its ‘‘V.I.P. Suite,” usual-
ly reserved for visiting schol-
ars, to John Tate, the Presi-
dent of the Piedmont Bank and
Trust Company, who is not even
a college employee.

I understand that some peo-
ple are offended by ‘‘obscene”
words printed in THE DAVID-
SONIAN by columnists. By con-
trast, I heard that the follow-
ing limerick was written by a
faculty member. and passed
around amongst his colleagues
while the faculty heard a pre-
sentation about the proposed ex-

Peace Group Up In Arms
Over Misquoted News Story

To The Editor:

Ralph Peeples, spokesman for
the Davidson Peace Coalition,
claims that DAVIDSONIAN
staff writer Tom Bruce misquo-
ted him in the Sept. 17, 1971
issue, concerning the use of
civil disobedience in the Nov.
6 demonstrations.

According to Peeples, che
question of civil disobedience,
as far as the Davidson Peace

Coalition is concerned, is up to
the individual. Officially, the
Coalition is taking no stand on
the question.

When asked to comment, Pee-
ples stated, ‘‘No civil disobedi-
ence is planned for Nov. 6, to
the best of my knowledge. There
will, however, very. likely be

some civil disobedience occur. —

ring in Washington throughout
October.”

Davidson Peace Coalition

change program with Baroda
University in India:

“There was a young man
from Baroda ;

Who'd not pay a whore what
he owed her.

She came in one day, and
asked him to pay,

And pissed in his whiskey

soda.”

I gulped the last bite of my
food and walked outside. I
looked around me at the cloud-
ed sky and the trees turning
brown in a few places.

Just down the road I could
see the new building for the
Honors College. That program
rejected me last year when
Frontis Johnston wrote that
*‘there was no one to direct my
Honors College program at this
time.”

I walked past Grey House
and wondered when this place
would ever begin to admit
women students, and I wonder-
ed, too, how long it would take
us after leaving here to regain
confidence in talking to girls as
people rather than just seeing
them as sex objects.

I wondered again why my
off-campus housing application
was rejected as I saw friends
of mine who walked past me
to their off-campus quarters.
This is my eighth year of dorm-
itory life.

I wandered -back toward my
room looking all around myself
and seeing again that despite
ali my hopes Davidson had not
changed, and I looked around
me wondering when I would be
rejected again or battered
around by this place where I
have committed four of my
life’s years.

My hope, on entering my
dorm, was that my waterbed
would seem like a nice retreat

‘from all that I saw and felt,

but when I returned, I heard
that Mrs. Nicholls wants me to_
get rid of that, too.
