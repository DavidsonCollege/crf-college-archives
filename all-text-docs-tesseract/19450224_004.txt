has been passed, there is no reason
why many informal parties should
not be held here. These would be
beneficial in several ways: First of
all it would enable the student to
have a good time right here on the
campus without having to go away
on the week ends, and without the
need of spending a great deal of
money. Secondly, it would enable
girls to visit our campus more. fre-
quently and, consequently the school
will become’ more popular. And
lastly, the social life of the student
would be greatly enlarged, ‘and
this is something that no man should
overlook. .

Because of the present difficulties
in travel which compel most stu-
dents to remain on the campus more
than they would in ordinary times,
the social departmnet of the Y cabi-
net has planned a series of social
functions which will be held on the
campus during the remainder of
the semester. A resume of the tenta-
tive plans is as follows:

During the first part of March,
a combined student body banquet
and dormitory stunt night is to be
held in the banquet hall of Cham-
bers, with Andy Owens in charge.
The function for the latter part of
March will be an Athletic night
which is to be held in cooperation
with the college athletic department.
In April, Davidson will play host
to the girls from Converse for the
first Davidson-Converse day to be
held on the campus in several years.

The ‘social department of the Y
cabinet is planning two major so-
cial activities per month during the
present semester. As yet, the plans
have been made through the first
part of April, but there will probably
be one moré function in April and
two in May. The rest of the plans
will be published as soon as they
are released.

up a function for some time this

best to secure a permanent chapter
room on the campus, to house the
two record collections and to pro-
vide a congenial meeting place. Phi

tends to remain the most active

supports ‘all musical events, parti-

Band, and tries in every way to
make the student body more music-

land, and he is well acquainted with
the’ Japanese military machine. He
does not, however, believe that the
Japanese nation must be destroyed.
On the contrary, it is the duty of
the Allied Nations to help the people
of Japan to establish their country
firmly and on a peaceable basis.
Commercial treaties and indus-
trial aid are essential in helping
Japan, and aid in establishing a
Proper government must also be
given.

Mr. Hudson’ s fourth point requires
that we help Japan spiritually.
Christianity must be established, for
“fundamentally, they need a change
of heart”. Finally we must “forgive

the common people$of Japan and
receive them as equals”. A definite
distinction has been made between
the military party ’and the Japanese
people, and the two factions must
be dealt with in different ways.
