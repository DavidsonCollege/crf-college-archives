THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 28, 1921.

Speaking of Sports.

We would venture to say that the
basketball quint from the Tobacco City,
where they roll their own, is a snappy
aggregation. The teamwork of this so-
called Durham “Y” was superb.

-——D—

That there was no — to this Dur-
ham five, is clearly shown by the fact |.
that they trimmed the Charlotte “y”
28 to 24. What is remarkable, is that
they carry only five players.

With Our Virginia Rivals.

The past week's results from the Old
Dominion are quite interesting.

Un. of Va., 44; Nn. of S. C, 9.

Un. of Va., 33; Richmond, 15.

Looks as if the Orange and Blue have
gotten to a good start from the above
scores.

—D—

Un. of Va., 33; Richmond, 15.

Elk’s Club, 39; Richmond, 23.

Wash. and Lee, 21; Richmond, 16.

These are the teams whom the Wild-
cats meet next week while in Virginia.
Relatively speaking, it would seem that
the University is' 5 points better than
the Elk’s Club, and 13 superior to Wash.
and Lee.

If that is the case, eet our hard-
est enemy first, and thé going becomes
easier as we travel.

—-D—

And now to get closer home—

Last week in comparing the showing
of three of the mid-state colleges
against the University of S. C. we
found them as follows:

Trinity, go; U. S. C, 12.

U.N. C, 34; U. S.C, 15.

N. C. State, 25; U. S. C,, 24

This would rate Trinity 9 points above
U.N. C. and 27 points above N. C. State.

—D—

During the last week Elon met Trin-
ity, U. N. C. and Wake Forest with the
following results:

Trinity, 59; Eton, 12.

U.N. C.,, 37; Elon, 12

Wake Forést, 16; Elon, 15.

—_—_D—-

The results of N. C. State’s trip will be
looked forward to with much interest.

It will be noticed that the University
of N. C. is just one day ahead of the
Wildcats on the Virginia invasion.

—D—-

The Red and Black quint leaves here

Tuesday. Go get ‘em Wildcats.
—p—

Thus it appears that Trinity is well
out in front for collegiate honors, with
the University running a fair second.
N. C. State, Wake Forest and Elon are
closely bunched and are lagging badly
in rear of the University.

—p—

At this writing, Guilford has not been
heard from, and her relative position is
as yet‘a Dark Horse.

—pD—.

Our only chance of comparison at all
so far is in the fact that Durham beat
Wake Forest 34 to 17, and trimmed us
4! to 16.

—.D—

Trinity met the University yesterday.

ford at Guilford.

resistance. Then at the beginning of
the fourth session an attempt by Lewis
to kick from behind their goal line was
blocked by McLeod, and three Juniors
frantically pursued the bouncing ball
back: to the fence where it was finally
captured for another touchdown. Luke
again registered a goal. One more dur-
ing the game the Juniors recovered a
fumble and took the ball over only to
lose it on a fumble after the. line was
crossed.

For the victors, the work of Erwin
and Moore at the halves and Dick at
quarter featured, while “Big” Knight in
the line made gaps for them time after
time. The whole team played good ball,
as did the Sophomores, who were handi-
capped by lack of experience. Tucker
was their sensation and did some good
work. He was a much bloodier Soph
when he came out than at the beginning.
Sorrels was the mainstay in the line
and Wiley played a good game in the
backfield.

MARKED SUCCESS.

(Continued from page 1)

that man has ever, perhaps, suffered.

It is impossible, the speaker conclud-
ed, to really love anyone without doing
something for him. Jesus is certainly
deserving of our love, and more, He has
real need of our service. As the old
violin maker said, “God could not make
Antonio Stradivari’s violins without An-
tonio,” and so God cannot accomplish
His work here in the world without us.
Ought we not to serve Him?

Friday Night.

The emptiness of the life of one who
tries to be spectacular, and the real joy
from service, humble though it may at
first appear, to one’s fellowmen, was the
theme of Dr. Thompson's Friday even-
ing address.

He told of his call to the catcher’s po-
sition on the baseball team, where he
had opportunity to hold the team to-
gether, though he could have made a
more spectacular player at shortstop.
Christ could have been a petty p-ince,
but chose service to mankind in tead.
His three years of service, his three
useful years, have been worth more than
all the philosophers in all history.

The speaker told of various persons
in history, and even in our own day,
who have served. Queen Victoria's gov-
erness is unknown to the world, though
she was great because of her service in
teaching the future queen in her girl-
hood how to serve and to bear her re-
sponsibilities. Gladstone was not a great
man because he: was rich or well-edu-
esated or handsome or a statesman, but
because he served. Abraham Lincoln
was poor and ugly but served his fel-
lows. In a vote of nine million, the
French people declared that not the
great general, Napoleon, but Pasteur,
the physician and surgeon, was their
great man, because of his service to
man. He told of kings, queens, generals
and admirals attending the funeral of
an “unknown soldier” because this sol-
dier had served his country and the
world.

Dr. Thompson urged the Davidson
men to determine that they would serve,
not wait for the nation or state or city
to act but determine that each as an
individual would serve others. It is not
in power, money, or knowledge that
greatness lies, but. in serving, and
through s service true happiness is found.

Sunday Morning.

“A man has one life to spend, one
great investment to make. Where and
how will it count for most?” said Dr.
Thompson in his address to the local
congregation Sunday morning on the
subject, “The Christian Ministry as a
Life Calling.” According to Dr. Thomp-
son the great basic decision is the re-
solve to serve God, regardless of where
the path of duty may lead or into what
field of work.

The Christian ministry is the funda-|
mental calling, for it deals with life,
with the human soul, at first hand. We
have today gone wild over steam en-
gines, electricity, money—we have for-
gotten Life, the soul of all. The min-
ister deals with money, but he does so
to transfer it to true Christian charac-
ter. Jesus Christ lived here with man
not to teach him electricity and money-
making, but to show him the way of
Life.

The ministry deals with men, not as
capitalists, or laborers, or financiers, but
face to face, as man with man. The
minister touches life in the deepest pos-
sible way; he sees life everywhere, un-
der all conditions; he is not satisfied
merely to meet his fellowman, but
yearns to help him onward and upward.

Ideals rule here on earth. Here is

life, back of life ideals, back of ideals
the ministry. The minister wants to
bring men to Christ, for Christ means
power. The minister deals more tunda-
mentally with life than the physician;
for when the physician has despaired of
life, has reached the end of his row, the
minister alone can aid, comfort, and
offer real strength. The minister deals
more fundamentally with life than the
lawyer, for the law too has its limits.
The ministry affects life more funda-
mentally than any calling, for while
others affect the body of man, Chris-
tianity saves his soul, that part of him
that never dies.
The Christian ministry is not an en-
tiching profession; the minister must be
a student, not only in one line of
thought, but in many; he must be an
efficient teacher; he must be a preacher;
he is developed socially, for truly, the
nobler the basis of our social relations,
the deeper the resulting friendship will
be; he must grow spiritually, for the
minister must be closer to God than
his people if he is to guide them to the
higher life. The ministry is not an en-
riching profession financially, but it is
sufficient; God has promised to care for
those that serve Him.

‘The ministry is calling for strong men
today; men with the will and ability to
“carry on;” the world is waking up! to
what shall it awake? Why should you
not serve God in some way? Think it
over seriously and prayerfully before
making your final decision.

Sunday Night.

The three great questions which are
to be decided by college men, first, Shall
I accept Christ as my personal Saviour?
second, What shall be my life work?
third, Who shall be my life partner?
were clearly and forcefully discussed by
Dr. Thompson at the closing service of
the Life Work Campaign.

Since these choices are so all-impor-
tant no man can afford to drift into eith-
er of them, but the questions should be
thought out carefully along the follow-
ing lines:

(1) What are my gifts?

(2) What are the needs of the world?

Are you talented as a farmer? Very
good. But where will you farm? Many
people are in want, and others are starv-
ing today because of ignorance of the
fundamental principles of agriculture.

Would you go into business? China
is sadly in need of capable Christian
business men to help her organize and
adjust herself. Almost limitless water
power is going to waste today in South
America because her people do not
know even the simplest mechanical con-
structions. What an opportunity for en-
gineers!

Teachers and physicians are needed
all over the world, but the supply is
very limited. Many of the towns in the
United States are overrun with doctors,
whereas in some of the foreign countries
90 per cent of the people die without
medical attendance.

Consult with your friends about your
talents and your life work; then ask
God—He knows and will lead aright.

In addition to the public services con-
ducted during the campaign, one hun-
dred and one personal interviews were
held with the various students, and the
benefits resulting from these can hardly
be measured. Mr. Edward E. Lane, Life
Work Secretary for the Southern Pres-
