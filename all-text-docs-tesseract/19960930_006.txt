When surveyed about the Elsewhere page, most students respond, “What is the Elsewhere page?”

This attitude reflects the lack of political activity and worldly awareness at Davidson. In this season of
the crunch, time flies here. We lose ourselves in the academic and the social while forgetting that something
very important is about to happen — the Presidential elections.

It may seem far away, but in fact we only have 37 days.

Many have decided that undecided is the way to go. It may seem easiest to dismiss all of the candidates,
complain about our workloads and blame the media for unfair race coverage, but information — mediated
and unmediated — is easily found.

By skimming a wide variety ofnewspapers or surfing the World Wide Web, one can find more than enough
information to get a basic idea of the ideas and issues, comings and goings of the presidential candidates.

The Davidsonian will try and do some of this for you. In the few weeks left before the elections, political
science faculty and students will discuss current issues on this page.
