Davidson President
Robert Morrison was a.graduate
of, the class of 1818, Chapel Hill, in
the same class with James K. Polk.
He served.as pastor of several North
Carolina and then
president of Davidson College from
1836 to 1840. He was still living in
1887 during Davidson's fifieth anni-
versary, but was not well enough to
attend:
All of Mr. Morrison's five daugh-
ers married officers in the Confeder-
ate Army: General T. J. Jackson,
Gen. D. He Mill, Col. John FE. Brown,
Gen. Rufus Barrington, and Major
Alphonso Avery.

Son Inherits Books
His library was inherited by his
grandson, Capt. Rufus Reid Morri-
son, who graduated from Davidson
in the 1902. He lived and
kept with him the books in the beau-
tiful Old mansion at Mt. Mourne,
When Capt. Morrison moved to
Davidson the old collection was se-
cured by the library. Since then the
family has moved to Raleigh.

The Morrison collection will af-
ford an interesting past time for
anyone in the mood to browse. They
will be placed in the Davidsoniana
