Harmon and Engell enlighten with their poetry

By JIM DILLON

William Harmon once wrote a
one line poem about a visit to a
rural North Carolina store.

Roses is full of geeks, I feel
right at home.

"Yes, that’s. a comma splice,
and. yes, it’s very indicat.ve of
Harmon’s style as a poet. He does
not follow the rules, and he does
not answer questions. _

“People ask me silly questions
like, ‘Are you kidding?*” he said.
“People who answer. questions are
like people who floss their teeth
too: much or wear seatbelts.
They're just asking for trouble.”

Gospel choir celebrates Martin

By MARK CHEN

Perhaps the best cultural event
this school year came to Love Au-

ditorium Sunday. It was the Gos- *

pel Choir Celebration held to
honor Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday.

Seven gospel choirs, five per-
formers from Davidson College.
both chaplains, _— President
Kuykendall and people of all races
came together for two and a half
hours to celebrate Dr. King. The

assembly also revealed some of |

the meaning behind Dr.- King’s
life.

Though Dr. King had his
greatest impact in the political
‘struggle for civil rights, the cele-
bration itself went back to his
roots. It was held as a church ser-
vice of the entire community.

received the 1970 Lamont Poetry
Award and the 1985. William Car-
los Williams Poetry Award. Mon-
day night-he gave a reading of his
work sponsored by the Union
Literary Arts Committee follow-
ing a reading by Davidson profes-
sor John Engell.

Harmon’s style of poetry is
very prose-like. Those present at

the reading actually heard very lit-
tle of his work. Harmon insisted. -

that.“no one should have to listen
to poetry for more than an hour,”
following forty minutes of reading
by Engell.

Tchaikovsky Piano Competition
in 1958. The Tchaikovsky Com-
petition held in Moscow and the

Van Cliburn Competition held in

Fort Worth, Texas, are usually

considered to be the two most pre- :

stigious. competitions in the
world. . Feghali, _ therefore,
achieved almost instant.fame after
winning first prize.

Jose Feghali is a native Brazi-
lian, but has lived and studied in
London for over ten years with
Maria Cucio, one of the greatest
teachers living. His style, as was
apparent to the audience, was bold
and distinctive. This boldness was
evident in his actual technique,

which was more wrist-oriented
than most pianists. Also, his inter- .

pretations of the music were
stamped .with his personal signa-
ture, most evident in his sudden

ligious beliefs in a political world.
The meaning of his life was. in his
political fight for the poor and the
oppressed.

Of course, this is the most
controversial legacy of King’s
life. Some today use his mixture
of religion and politics to criticize
King, while others use him as the
justification for their own efforts.
On one side exists the liberation
theologians, on the other the re-
ligious right. Radicals say he did
not go far enough in his crusade,

while Jesse Helms would say that ©

he: went altogether too far. If the
meaning of King’s life is in his
political involvement, then it is
not one to which all people can
agree.

The gospel choirs offered
another meaning to King’s life.
While King had graduate and doc-
toral degrees in systematic theol-
ogy, he quoted the New Testa-

-ment and returned to his most

basic beliefs for strength. The call

stantly interrupting his work, say-
ing things like “Someone actually
asked me that,” “I wrote this last
month,” and “I didn’t read that
right.” To one. student laughing
audibly in the front row he asked,
“Can I take you home?”

Harmon is a,Southern writer.
He was born in Concord, North
Carolina and, although he earned
degrees from the Universities of
Chicago and Cincinatti, he re-
turned to Chapel Hill where he re-
ceived a master’s degree.

_ His writing exhibits a flair for
the South, such as capturing de-
tailed description of the.music on
radio stations on a trip from North

Carolina to Texas. He often
seemed extremely sarcastic, but it
was sarcasm that generated laughs
from the ‘audience. None was
meant to offend.

Harmon’s always humorous
style contrasted with that of En-
gell,. who read a collection of
poems he had dedicated to his son
Fredrick, now two years old. En-
gell said he originally attempted to
keep a journal for his son, but that

- attempt failed. Engell decided to
* write a monthly (with exceptions)

poem of 34 lines in “loose pen-
tameter” utilizing Matthew Ar-
nold’s “simplicity of style” for his
son.

His poetry ‘was written, he
said, to his son but also to a wider
audience. The speaker in the
poem, he says, “is quite definitely

e.” His. poems recount. some
quite normal. tasks of fatherhood
such as “Feeding Him” and “Put-
ting Him to Bed,” but also have
somewhat philosophical implica-
tions that extend from the stories
of his “elegant and difficult
child.” t

Engell insisted that he is not a
poet. He has written “a bunch of
critical stuff,” five plays and “a
whole lot of short stories” but rela-
tively few poems. The group of
poems dedicated to his son is his
first collection.

Perhaps Feghali’s affinity for
providing for providing an enter-
taining and somewhat unusual in-
terpretations of the music was be-

cause of the nature of the perfor- -

mance. The atmosphere of a com-
petition is much more rigid than a
recital for a paying audience. The
Davidson recital, falling in the lat-
ter category, provided Feghali

-with a more relaxed atmosphere in

which he could test fresh, even
controversial, interpretations of a
more intensely personal, passion-
ate nature.

ally to King, and he rebelled

against it. Yet King eventually
turned to it as his destiny. One

pastor preached that King had not

been the leader of the civil rights
movement, but God. For the com-
mon people who followed him,
King was a God-haunted man who
preached the truth. They needed
no other political theory to lead
them.

Each choir did two hymns and

_ all of them set the audience mov-

ing. They poured their passions
and beliefs into each song, with
each song rising in free-flowing
yet unified harmony. ‘In all the
chuches I have attended, the

minister always wore black and:

the choir a violent red. These
groups varied from either pure

_white to the brightest yellows,

blues and greens. Even the names
of the choirs had variety. There

and Prokofiev’s Sonata No. 7, as
well as an encore by Heitor Villa-
Lobos (a Brazilian composer),
was not an easy recital to play suc-
cessfully. The Beethoven and De-
bussy (which contains “Claire de
Lune”) are instantly recognized

by almost anyone with classical

musical tastes or piano experience
of more than five years.

Some people in the audience,
‘uninterested in the freshness of a
live performance and new inter-
pretations, may have reacted
negatively to Feghali’s concert
because of this recognizability.
Unfortunately the familiarity of
recorded versions of this music
can bias an audience towards one
unchanging performance. Feghali

showed his self-confidence and ~

desire for creative interpretation
even when choosing his recital

program. .

Personally, I found the Bach
exciting, the Beethoven captivat-
ing, the Debussy relaxing
(perhaps too: much so), and the ©
Prokofiev on the verge of being
spectacular. Regrettably,. the
Steinway. piano in Love Au-
ditorium is shallow and inconsis-
tent in brightness among its “tes-

-siaturas,” and I have a great deal
“of respect for any pianist who

dares attempt a formal recital on
the instrument. Jose Feghali is a
gifted pianist who will probably
make his mark in the musical
world..

Despite the large number of
pianists found at Davidson Col-
lege and in the community, sur-
prisingly few pianists are invited
to perform in the Artist Series.
The last was Claude Frank in early
1984.

Davidson students also par-

fore the celebration, a blues singer
and activist with Dr. King had
died. His place in the program was
taken by Jackie Daughtery and
Muadi Mukenge. Daughtery gave
the last sermon King preached be-

- fore his death, while Mukenge

accompanied her on the clarinet.
The sermon, as if he had known
beforehand, talked about what
King wanted to be remembered
about his life. It too, emphasized
that he had worked for the poor
and the oppressed in the name of
Christ. It spoke in a simple yet
eloquent language. —
