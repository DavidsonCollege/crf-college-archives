Professor Marcon Urges Less
structured Early Learning

By TINA SMITH

“Make kindergarten, kinder-
garten again,” says Rebecca A.
Marcon, visiting assistant profes-
sor of psychology at Davidson
College. Marcon is calling for
changes in the way parents, teach-
ersand school administrators view
learning and child development in
pre-kindergarten and kindergarten.

In 1987, the District of Colum-
bia Public School System asked
Marcon to evaluate pre-kindergar-
ten programs and targetareas which
either strengthened or weakened a
child’s path to success in later years.
In the resulting three-year study,
Marcon found that children in an
“active learning” environment
rated better in basic skills mastery
and developmental areas such as
communication, language devel-
opment, motor development, daily
living skills and interpersonal skills
than their counterparts in teacher-
directed academic groups.
Teacher-directed groups lacked
social skills early on, and slipped
even further behind as they pro-
gressed through school.

The study originated from
growing concerns of parents,
community members and District
of Columbia officials over thehigh
failure rates of economically dis-
advantaged students at the first-
grade level. All of these students
had attended free, public pre-kin-
dergarten programs. » Although
similar Studies had been done,
Marcon’s project was unique be-
cause it took place in actual class-
room settings under less-than-ideal
circumstances. Previous studies
had been conducted in a university
lab environment with low student-
teacher ratios and adequate mate-
rials needed for success.

“In early childhood learning,
which spans from birth through
third grade, there is a big contro-
versy whether or not tg Stress
teacher-directed academics, which
parents expect, or a more child-
centered active- learning ap-
proach,” Marcon said,

“Children aren’t sscrificing
academic skills using the more

active-learning model,” Marcon
Said. “It’s not academic versus
non-academic. In both models
children are learning. The impor-
tant difference is whether it’s the
children or the teacher who are
initiating or directing the learning.
If the activity for the day is making
Kool-Aid, for instance, ina teacher-
directed classroom the teacher
stands at the front of the class and
demonstrates how to make Kool-
aid. Then, all the children are al-
lowed to taste it. In the more active
model, materials are set up at learn-
ing centers and the children and
the children have to figure outhow
to make the Kool-Aid themselves.
In this way, they actively learn the
use of fractions and proportions -
what the effects are if they put in
too much sugar or too much wa-
ter.”

But Marconacknowledges that
a switch to this type of learning
won't be easy. It’s going to take a
lot of work. to re-orient teachers,
parents and others involved in a
child’s educational progress,” she
said.

Neither will it come cheaply.
Last year the District of Columbia
greatly expanded its budget for
early childhood programs in pro-
viding more effective classroom
materials. But Marcon believes it
is a worthwhile investment. She
pointed out that getting children

—interested in. learning early oncan

avoid a host of problems later, and
cited a University of Michigan

study which shows that every dol-
lar spend in early childhood pro-
grams saves six dollars later in
areas such as special education
keeps down delinquency, drop-out
and teen pregnancy rates.

Facts like those make her work

of vital interest not only to,District
of Columbia school system policy
makers, but also to the U.S. De-
partment of Education and other
national groups advocating for
young children.

Marcon said few school havea
pre-kindergarten system as exten-
siveas the one in the District of Co-
lumbia. Rather than beginning pre-
kindergarten programs, Marcon
believes most school systems
should work on modifying their
already-existing kindergarten pro-
grams.

“Kindergarten does not need
to be first grade,”Marcon said. “If
you focus only on academics you
are ignoring vital other parts of
that child. School curriculums
should center on developing the
whole child. If the home and the
community don’tin the urban com-
munity and schools fail to address
the issue, where will those chil-
dren learn to cope?”

She added that the active learn-
ing model is beneficial not only to
economically disadvantaged chil-
dren, but is also valuable for chil-

“dren from all socioeconomic lev-

els.

Marcon’ 's future plans include
follow-up work on the same Dis-
trict of Columbia classes at key
education transition points to see
how many students in her groups
are on grade level or have dropped
out. She may also expand her study
to other populations of children.

Marcon received her B.A. in
psychology from California State
University of Fullerton. After re-
ceiving her master’s degree in
counseling and school psychology
from the UCLA, she work for the
Los Angeles County School Sys-
tem as aschool psychologist. Mar-
con earned her Ph.D. in develop-
mental psychology from Louisi-
ana State University and began
teaching at Davidson in 1989.

CASE Professor of the Year Anthony Aveni will speak on Mayan
Astronomy onTuesday, November 13 in the 900 Room.

Lecturer To Speak On
Mayan Astronomy

By PHIDERIKA FOUST

Mayan priestomers carefully
watched the planet Venus, clock-
ing its motion to an accuracy of
better than two hours in five centu-
Ties - all without the advantage of
modern technology.; What drove
them to such precision? What
methods did, they use?

These questions will be ad-
dressed by Anthony F. Aveni, the
“founding father” of the field of
archaeostronomy in a lecture on
“Skywatchers in Ancient Mex-
ico.” He will speak at Davidson
College on Tuesday, Nov. 13, at
7:30 p.m. in ‘the College Union
900 Room.

Archaeological studies of the
Mayan culture of Central America
have shown that the Mayan rulers
were obsessed with the study of
time, calendars and. astronomy.
Aveni will attempt to convey an
understanding and appreciation of

Mayan calendar documents, hiero-
glyphic writing and the role of
astronomical orientations in Ma-
yan architecture.

Aveni is the Russell B. Col-
gate professor of Astronomy and
Anthropology at Colgate Univer-

_Sity... He has. published:.and. lec-

tured extensively, and in 1982 he
won the National Professor of the
Year Award from the Council for
the Advancement and Support of
Education.

His Davidson presentation is a
part of the Wearn Lecture Series.
The Wearn Lecture is named in
honor of Dr. Joseph T. Wearn ’13
for the purpose of creating influen-
tial learning opportunities for
Davidson students. The lecturer is
chosen every year for outstanding
accomplishments in the sciences
or for exceptional statesmanship.

Casolo, Arrested by Salvadoran
Government, Speaks at Davidson

COLLEGE RELATIONS

When Connecticut woman Jen-
nifer Casolo moved to El Salvador
in 1985 torepresent Christian Edu-
cation Seminars, she knew there
was a risk involved with living ina
country engaged in civil war. She
will speak at Davidson College on
Sunday, Nov. 11, about just how
dangerous in became for her.

Her free public lecture begins
at 7:30 p.m. in the College Union
900 Room.

On Nov. 26, 1989, Casolov was
arrested in araid by the Salvadoran
police, who said they found alarge
cache of arms and ammunition
buried in the garden in the back

yard of her rented home. She was
deported two weeks later after a
military judge ordered herreleased
for lack of evidence.

Casolo worked in El Salvador
for four years organizing tours for
Americans so they could learn
about the civil war between the
rebels and the government. The
security officers making her arrest
reportedly acted on a tip from a
captured rebel. Casolo claimed
not to know how the good got
there. Casolo has insisted that she
must have been setup, probably by
those opposing the church group
asrebels. During her stay in prison
inE] Salvador, Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat
who heads the Senate Foreign

Relations Committee’s panel on
Latin American affairs, talked
several times with El Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani about
the case. Dodd said that he not
threaten Cristiani with a possible
cutoffof American aid. However,
because Dodd was chairman of the
panel which oversees American
aid to El Salvador, which was $1.4-
million a day at the time, he had
considerable leverage over the situ-
ation.

Cristiani said that the decision

to free Casolo was purely judicial

and not based on international —

pressure. However, he did later
acknowledge that there are “obvi-
ously a lot of repercussions when
foreigners are taken prisoner.”
