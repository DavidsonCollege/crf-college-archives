The Delta Circle of Omicron Delta
Kappa, national leadership fraternity,
was represented at the eleventh biennial
convention by Gordon “Skip” Brown and
Mr. F, L. Jackson, treasurer of David-
son College, during the past week at
the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati,
Ohio,

Mr. Jackson, member of the General
Council, which is composed of seven
members, was appointed to serve on the
Committee on Credentials and Reports
of National Officers. “Skip” Brown re-
ceived a position on the Laws and Pol-
icy Committee. Mr. Jackson was se-
lected as a Council member at the
O. D. K. conclave held at Duke Uni-
versity in 1933,

The delegates representing the Da-
vidson circle left on Wednesday and ar-
rived in Cincinnati in time for the ini-
tial session of the convention on Thurs-
day morning. The opening of the con-
clave began with the addresses of sev-
eral distinguished university speakers. A
convention smoker followed. These
functions were open to a group of in-
vited guests and members of Omicron
Delta Kappa.

The first business session of the con-
vention began Friday and all important
matters were dealt with at this time.
The fraternity held its banquet that aft-
ernoon and a formal ball was given at
the Netherland Plaza Hotel. The Da-
vidson_student delegate, as you would
expect, participated in a traditional. Da-
vidsonian fashion, Modesty prevents his
_admitting the fact, but this astounding
fact can be verified by others in‘ attend-
ance from Davidson.

The final business session of the con-
vention opened Saturday morning and
it preceded the election and installation
of new officers for the General Council.

The Davidson representatives stated
that they were impressed with the va-
rious reports made on the national ac-
tivity of the fraternity. Omicron Delta

R. O.T.C. Unit Asks
For Care Of Uniforms

At the beginning of the school
year the ROTC battalion was équip-
ped with serge uniforms, couapting
of 18 doz, blouses with blue [pels
and trousers. ~

Due to the constant increase of
commodity and manufacturing costs,
and to reduced appropriations, the
necessity for care of uniforms was
never more apparent than at the
present time. All are urged to ex-
ercise diligence in reducing to a
minimum the wear and tear which
the uniforms must undergo.

Those students residing out of
town may have to wear their uni-
forms after drill periods, but. men
living on the pus should
their uniforms for civilian clothes
before engaging in athletic games
and labor. The uniform should be
worn only on drill days

Mixed uniform, that is, part issued
uniform and part civilian clothes,
is never to be worn. When the uni-
form is worn it should be complete, |
regulation trousers, shirt, and tie. .

|MAOQUERS GIVE
THREE-AGT PLAY

Unusually Large ““Audients: At-
tends Red And Black Mas-
quers’ Production

The Red and Black Masquers present-
ed a three-act mystery melodrama, en-
titled Three Taps at Twelve, Fri-
day evening, March 22.

An unusually large crowd braved the
inclement weather to witness the sec-
ond presentation of the year by the Red
and Black Masquers at Chambers Audi-
torium.

The cast of the play is as follows:
The Ingenue—Miss Lucy Currie; The
Juvenile Lead—Fields Horine; ‘The
Dope Addict—Treadway Purnell; The
Unclé—Richard Hillier; Mrs. Gage—
Miss Letitia Currie; Her Husband—Joe
Dees; “Cattish"—A. C. Cline; Mrs.
Baker—Miss Steele; and Dr. Hull—P.
Y. Harlan,

Edward Donnigan was in charge of
the direction of the play. Professor E.
J. Erwin, Bill Pierce, Dunlap. Covington,
and Dave Herring were in charge of the
renovation of scenery.

The play was a mystery ‘in which
Richard Hillier, acting as Jamieson Ed-
wards, the unscrupulous old invalid, in-
vites a number of people whom he has
tricked out of their money to his home
for supper. These people, besides hat-
ing Edwards, dislike eaclf other. ‘The
curtain opens on a dark room where
they are all playing a parlor game, mur-
der. They soon tire of this and stop,
Edwards tells them that he has .drawn
up his»will and out of the five guests
present, he is’ going to leave four of
them four-fifths of his will, while the
other one-fifth will go to his nephew.
The guests ask which of them will not
receive an inheritance . Edwards replies
that they will play the game of murder
again and this time the victim will not
get up; he will be dead. Weapons from
all countries are on the walls. Finally,
to get their money back, they agree to
the old man’s cruel demand. The lights
go out. A horrible scream pierces the
air and at the Same instant there is a
pounding on the window from outside.
The lights come on. Instead of one of
the guests, Jamieson Edwards lies dead.
His nephew arrives from college and
immediately suspects that the guests
killed his uncle for revenge. The guests
claim that it is suicide. After a series
of thrilling events, it was discovered
that Harmon Gage had poisoned Jamie-
son Edwards with his fountain pen which
he had filled with a strong poison and

Boggs And. Smith Victorious In
Debate Friday

After an absence of about ten days,
the aflirmative--combination of Tyler
Port and James Selango returned to the
campus last Friday afternoon with a
multitude of new laurels for the varsity
debating team's record this year.

Port and Selango, both debating for
their first year in varsity circles, made
the western trip and gained three vic-
tories over their opponents and sustained
no defeats. Their tour followed the suc-
southern trip) made previously
by Harold Sugg and Albert Stutts.

All three of the debates were won
by Judges’ decisions, unanimously in fa-
vor of the Davidson team. Their first
victory was over the University of the
South at Sewanee, Tenn., on Friday eve-
ning, March 15. The team next’ jour-
neyed to Danville, Ky., where they en-
gaged Centre College on the evening of
March 19 in a formal debate before a
large audience including faculty and stu-
dents there. The Davidson debaters
again won by decision of the judges.

Subject Of Talk Given By

Dr. John R. Cunningham, president of
the Louisville “Presbyterian Seminary,
spoke to the Ministerial Band at the so-
cial center last Sunday afternoon at 1:30
o'clock.

His general topic for discussion was
the aspect of the tministerial student on
the Davidson campus, and seminary
work after graduation from college. He
said that the ministerial students should
more or less make good examples of
themselves in their actions and their lan-
guage upon}the campus, as all Christian

At Finish Of

Amid the raucous blasts of the bus
horn and the strains of “Carry Me Back
to Old Virginny,” the glee club and or-
chestra rolled into Davidson Saturday
night, after a four-day trip through Vir-
ginia. i

The members were in an exuberant
mood, and why shouldn’t they be? It
isn’t every week one gets to visit three
women’s colleges.

The glee club bus, Macduff at the
helm, departed from the campus Wednes-
day afternoon for Greensboro Women’s
College, where the inmates waited at
their windows with hopeful expectancy.
On arriving, the clever little game of
“blind dating” was indulged in, and din-
ner was served. After the concert itself,
the bus left the campus amid the weep-
ing of maidens and the gnashing teeth
of deans.

The_night was spent at the Hotel
Zinzendorf at Winston-Salem. ‘Twas
there, at two in the morning, that Mills
Taylor, Dick ‘Vowles and Dunnie Cov-
ington conceived the brilliant idea. of
serenading. The soothing strains of
“Rock A-Bye Baby in the Tree Top”
pervaded the hotel atmosphere, and ‘it
was reported that the hotel manager
was entranced, At least, he came up to
say so. Roommates Robinson, King,
Stewart and Chandler, immediately be-
low, were also highly pleased.

And then to Staunton, home of the
Mary Baldwin ‘damsels. In this village,
a good part of the group was put up
atethe military academy to show the
folks real discipline. Harris Bradley
and Joy Martin slept in Woodrow Wil-

son’s old house, right over the room

Four Day Tour

where the blessed event took place.

In the evening, after a formal dinner,
the glee club and orchestra. presented a
concert at Harrisonburg Teachers’ Col-
lege. That night, Mattocks, Nash and
Martin were ousted from the steps by an
irate warden, and the same gripe started
to drag our director off the campus for
escorting his wife past the bus. Hassell
walked away with one of the prizes,
while that lucky Cunningham boy had
a date with the dean’s daughter and her
car. Moreland Cunningham says, “I just
love deans, especially if they have
daughters and automobiles.” Sidelight:
\Buddy Robinson and “Sprinkle.”

Then . Macduff (not the band trip
Macduff) escorted the party back to the
military academy for a good night's
sleep. The bus was minus a radiator
cap, due to some female souvenir hound

With the melodious notes of the
bugle, the Davidson delegation awoke
bright and early the next morning—at
6:30. They say Bob Leonard slept
through all the bugle calls. If he did,
he’s a genius. The academy furnished
towels, but Ed Johnson and Cunningham
smelled a rat somewhere. Sure enough,
there was one at the bottom of the pile.

After ‘a_formal dinner and concert at
Mary Baldwin, the two organizations
were entertained at a reception, Hervey
Ross was seen with the daughter of a
Porto Rican millionaire, and Edwards
wasn’t wasting any time either. Later
that night, Buddy Robinson and -‘“Chub-
by” King had a narrow escape from the
cop while climbing around the Y. M.
C. A. fire escape. They said they didn’t
have a key.

Plans For Bowefy
Frolics Revealed

Jimmy Poyner And His Pawn-
brokers To Supply Music
For Bowery Ball

social

Further plans for the success of the
approaching Bowery Ball, to be held
April 13 as a feature of the three spring
dances, were revealed today with the an-
nouncement by P. Mims Rogers, Pan-
Hellenic Council president, that Jimmy
Poyner and his Pawnbrokers will sup-
ply the music:

Not only did Maestro Poyner prom-
ise the same fine music that he offered
last Home-coming, but he plans to dress
the orchestra in special costumes of
Bowery nature for the occasion. Fur-
thermore, he will offer as a particular
attraction a torch singer from the State
of Virginia. Further data concerning
this young lady was not available as The
Davidsonian went to press.

Geddie Monroe, to whom the Council
relegated the job of decorating, after
offering it to every other interior dec-
orator within the vicinity, is reported to

be losing sleep at night thinking up
wild schemes for the dressing of the
building.

Prizes, will be offered to the boy and
girl wearing the most unusual and effect-
ive costumes. “I would like to make
this confidential and unusual announce-
ment,” whispered Rogers into the ear
of the reporter. “These dances will be
the cheapest and best’that Davidson has
had in a long time.”

“Well, by jiminy and Leapin’ Liz-
ards!” spake the reporter when-he had
been revived by bystanders, “that’s the
first time I’ve heard that before.”

It is reported that the contract has

been signed.
