F-Crew plays
major role in
planning a Friday
evening of fun

By Laura Seib

To show spirit for all student
athletes and the last football game
of the season against the
Bridgewater Eagles, the Student
Union and the Athletic department
sponsored the "Earth, Wind, and
Fire" event. The Union Outpost,
Concert and Social committees, F-
Crew, planned a pep rally and bon-
fire Friday night on Patterson
Court. On Saturday after the game,
there was a post-party celebration
for the football players. Earth,
Wind and Fire, manned by F-Crew
members, began with a hayride
through the town at 7:00 p.m. and
ended with the sounds of the cover
band Root Doctors at midnight.

Leaving from the Outpost
from 7-9, a horse-drawn carriage
filled with hay and wool blankets
pulled students through the town
in fifteen-minute intervals.

“We circled around the cam-
pus, down Main Street, and then
returned tothe Outpost,” said fresh-
man Martin Young.

At 8:15 p.m., the Root Doc-
tors played their first set until the
pep rally started.

As part of the pep rally, all
Patterson Court Houses were asked
to participate in the Bridgewater
Eagle Burn by submitting an eagle
to be burned in the bonfire. For
showing the most creativity, Figi
was awarded $50 from the Ath-
letic Department.

With hot dogs roasting and
the band finishing its second set,
. the fire continued until midnight.
“The bonfire was huge and really
warm. All the football players
came out for the pep rally,” said
freshman Shelley Elifson.

The committees had been

planning for this event for three
and a half weeks, according to
sophomore Rosie Molinary, F-
Crew advisor.

Young, who also helped with
the festivities, said, “A lot of people
came out, especially for the hay

‘rides and the pep rally.”

Originally planned to be a pre-
game tailgate party, Saturday’s
support changed to post-game ac-
tivities. “F-Crew handled a post-
game party to congratulate the play-
ers for an improved and successful
season,” said Molinary.

About the F-Crew

By Carrie Blackburn

For the past four years, F-
Crew, a Union Committee com-
posed of representatives from each
freshmen hall, has tried to intro-
duce freshman to the activities of
the Union.

Meeting regularly, this “Fresh-
men Crew” of 51 members plans

various activities of their own as
well as assisting with other Union-
sponsored functions.

This year they have already
hosted two study breaks including
one on November 9th at the Union
Outpost which featured the acous-
tic tunes of Miles Mowry.

F-Crew was also an integral
part of last Friday’s "Earth, Wind,
and Fire" hayride, bonfire, and
pep rally. Members ran the hay-
ride and served as fire monitors for
the blaze.

Co-Chairperson Kristy Kops
comments on their purpose: “Our
goal this year is to make F-Crew
known.

"It is the job of the people on
F-Crew to get freshmen involved
with the Union so they know there
is an alternative choice for what to
do.”

Since students are constantly
bombarded with flyers about the
activities of Patterson Court, the
Union activities are often harder to
publicize.

“It is by no means a competi-

SGA debates makeup of social group senators

By Rachel Dunifon

While many Davidson stu-
dents watched Perot and Gore fight
it out on Larry King Live last
Tuesday, Davidson’s Student Sen-
ate engaged in a milder debate of
theirown, At issue was senatorial
representation of various campus
groups:

Currently, one representative

’ ofthe international students sits on
the Senate, but doesn’t havea vote.
Earlier this semester, when a char-
ter was granted to the International
Student Association (ISA), the
question of whether or not their
new representative would now
have a vote arose. However, this
would mean that international stu-
dents would be unable to vote in
Independent senatorial elections.
The ISA decided to keep things the
way they are, continuing to make
their voices heard through their
Independent senators.

This brought the issue of the
Black Student Coalition to the sur-
face, as their representative does
have a vote. However, this is be-
cause BSC members do not vote in
elections for Independent senators.

Additionally, BSC members who
also belong to other houses can
only vote for one senator.

Efforts to clarify these voting
procedures will begin with the next
round of SGA elections in the
spring.

To add to the debate, junior
Leigh Rawdon proposed changing
the way that women’s eating houses

are represented. She suggested
that houses that are over twice as
large as most houses be allowed
two senators to better represent
Patterson Court women. Currently,
each eating house and fraternity
elects one senator, despite their
size. The technicalities and valid-
ity of this issue will be discussed at
the next SGA meeting,

tion to the court, if anything just to
complement it,” cautions Rosie
Molinary who serves as F-Crew’s
representative on the Union Board.
She continues that “there are some
freshmen who come in with some
new ideas. This is a good way to
keep their hall involved, and its the
only real body that lets freshmen
have a voice.” :

Fourth Cannon’s Representa-
tive, Katherine Ross, feels F-Crew
“provides a way for freshmen who
are not sure if they want to be

involved with student government
to get exposed to it.”

Third annual
community
dinner sees
SUCCESS

_ By Meg Wolff

Davidson Together and
Davidson/Cornelius Parks and
Recreation Department hosted
what has become a Davidson tra-
dition, the community dinner. On
Wednesday, November 10 begin-
ning at 6 p.m. at the Ada Jenkins
Center, the dinner featured the
Gethsemane Gospel Singers.

Members from Project Life, a
campus group that sponsors the
Bone Marrow Drive on campus,
also spoke briefly to encourage
more community members to par-
ticipate in the marrow drive.

The community dinner began
three years ago through the initia-
tive of Davidson Together, a Reach
Out program which aims to unify
the community and cross racial,
age, and other boundaries to tie the
college closely to the community.

The program has been benefi-
cial in alleviating tension between
the college andthe community and
also in creating closer ties between
students and community members.

‘Casey Hawthorne, Jarrell
Palmer, and Meg Wolff, the coor-
dinators of Davidson Together,
were excited about the event and
received many positive responses
from students, faculty, and com-

munity members.
All students were invited.
