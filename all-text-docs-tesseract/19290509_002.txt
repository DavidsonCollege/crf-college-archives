snappy newspaper.

—Rumors that “Red Laird” is
bringing some of those school-
boys of his up to play football.
Glory.

TRUSTEE OF DAVIDSON

Probably at no other time in
history has the attention of the
student body been focused on the
Board of Trustees to the extent
which it is at present. For that
matter, the whole Presbyterian
Church, and thousands of inter-
ested parties are watching eager-
ly to see what action the Board
will take at its next meeting here.
A tremendous responsibility rests
upon the shoulders of these men
as they gather to select a new ad-
ministrator for Davidson, and the
students of the college are the
most concerned body as the time
for action draws near.

Davidson has had many critical
times during the near century.
of her existence,, but it seems
to us that she faces the most cru-
cial period of all at the present.
The new president is coming into
a field which offers challenging
constructive work for a capable
man, and he will have his hands
full of a multitude of affairs, both
mechanical and human. He will
have to deal with contracts and
contacts, entities which have no
end of possibility for lasting
creative processes. Standing on
the threshold of a new day of
a new day service to mankind
and to God, Davidson College
calls-for a strong hand and a
great heart to lead her. up the
heights which still are untraveled.

Sentiment is strong about the
campus in regard to the new pres-
ident. The men are looking to
the Board of Trustees to think
and act with foresight, to weigh
_all_chances, to investigate all
- avenues of approach to the situa-
tion, to act for the principles
"which will make Davidson stead-
fast, but progressive. Every man

wt

yer

on the campus feels a very real
interest in this coming event
which will to so large an extent
influence the future of the col-
lege. Years of work and associa-
tion have left a deep imprint of
Davidson on each life engaged in
the work of the college, and so it
is. with concern for their Alma
Mater that the students them-
selves await the outcome of the
3oard’s meeting in June.

Dr. Lacy, Dr. Thompson, Frank
Graham, S. Clay Williams — all
names to reckon with in the final
decision. Whatever happens and
whoever is elected may the Board
be governed in its thinking by the
apt words of Dr. Hamilton Mc-
Kay, President of the Alumni As-
sociation: “The new president
must be a man who will make Da-
vidson, not one whom Davidson
will make.”

LOCAL SUMMER SCHOOL
Professor Fleagle states that
indications point to a much great-
attendance at the summer
school opening here June 11 than
was in evidence last year. He ex-
pects to double the enrollment,
and all preparations are being
made to elevate the Davidson
Summer School to the high rank-
ing of which it is capable and
which it deserves in the light of
Davidson College’s rating.

Summer school here should
grow into a very important part
of the college activity. Each year
has seen growing attendance and
better accommodations for the
students. More classes are be-
ing offered each year, with the
prospects of rfew ones as the de-
mand arises. Work is being given
this_summer not only in regular
college courses, but in methods
for grade school teachers, and of
course this addition will draw
many teachers to Davidson for
the six weeks period. Full credit
on college courses is gained by
six weeks’ work in the summer
school. Thus students who found

the going is a little rough during
the regular session will try to
stage their comebacks.

The and natural ad-
vantages of Davidson make it es-
pecially suitable for the work of
summer school. The campus
here is unsurpassed in beauty,
and the town, while lacking the
advantages of a city, really offers
ideal environment for work
this kind. Some complaints are
heard about spending the summer
in Davidson because the town is
“dead.” When one is unable to
off his work during the
school year it seems to us that
he would do well to seek out a
“dead” spot where the street cars
don’t rattle so loudly or the lights
shine so brightly and buckle
down in earnest.

Davidson will probably never
grow into one of the teeming
summer camps for students
which exist at other institutions
nearby, and in view of the col-
lege’s attitude toward a large
student body, it is well that the
summer school enrollment, too,
be kept comparatively low. How-
ever, in the near future, we ex-
pect to see several hundred pil-
grims treking here in June for a
“comeback” or step ahead as the
case may be. The opportunity
for a great summer school lies
right here in Davidson.

By John Brown

The Department of Printing and
Engraving in Washington has been
busy lately printing new bills. These
new bills, which are 2-3 the size of the
present ones, will be put into circula-
tion in July to replace the 900,000,000
now in use. Each denomination will
have a different head on it, Washing-
ton being on $1 bills, Jefferson on $2,
Lincoln on $5, and so on up to Chase
on the $10,000 bills. The new bills
will save the Government a large
amount of paper, and will not wear out
as quickly as the old ones.

Another step of modernization is be-
ing contemplated in Turkey. The An-
gorg Assembly may decide to enforce
the adoption of the metric system. The
Turkish customs and many commercial
houses have already adopted this sys-
tem, so it would not be a very radical
change.

As the army of the Wuhen opposi-
tion to the Chinese Nationalist Gov-
ernment advanced last week toward
Tsinanfu, which was still in control of
the Japanese, cannibalism was report-
ed to be on the increase. Thousands

in Kansu province, so..human flesh is
in many cases their*only means of

that the technical schools, the
law and medical colleges do paint
their students toward a definite

in its broadest sense is not a
thing that seeks only to raisé

learns to look at life through the
eyes of others, to broaden his own
narrow vision with the sweep-
ing reflections of Carlyle and
Dante. The realm of music opens
up to him a new world, the ma-
jestic strains of Schubert and
Wagner, whom he has _ been
taught to appreciate, waken in
his soul a response that lies dor-
mant in the life of the uneducated
man.

Cosmic Chaos
By J. W. McCutchan

It would appear thet the athletic
cabinet of the G. O. P. is in full swing.
With Stimson playing tennis every
morning, Mellon talking over the meg-
aphone, vitaphone, and other instru-
ments, and Curtis horse-back’ riding
after seeing his wife safely seated in
Washington society, letters should soon
be awarded. Preferred an “R” or a
“W.” The president himself has been
catching a few small fish hither and
yon. It is to be surmised that some
few million Democratic voters will yet
have the feeling of a fish for splitting
their ticket.

Other governments have their
troubles too, even rebel ones. A rather
bashful “greater” was recently ar-
rested in this country under the
charges of absconding with some
$750,000.00 from the rebel Mexican
army. He maintained his innocence
under the plea that it was personal
property. Unfortunately, however, he
was also under the charge of violating
an immigration act.

Edward J. Tobin, of Chicago, will
astound many of the younger intel-
ligentsiae with his recent statistics. He
plainly states that the present adoles-
cent generation is going to the depths
of perdition, but insists that it be al-
lowed to work out its own problems.
Whether this suggestion is sincere or
whether he is afraid to advise other-
wise is not made clear, for his investi-
gations were made in Cook County,
Illinois, where our elders set such an
upright example. More power to him.

When Catherine Carr was adjudged
the most beautiful and most popular
girl in the Oriental Fiesta, at Ogden,
Utah, she was doubtless glad that some
of the Mormon customs have been
frowned upon by law. Even then she
is not protected from the book agents
of that sect, who, when they meet an
especially attractive woman, take her
name and through secret processes re-
serve her for their particular wife in
the world to be.

In addition to the other affairs of
national importance, Cosmic Chaos
wishes to take this opportunity of
thanking all its readers or of com-
mending those who have not read it.
Good judgment is better than fine
riches or filthy lucre either. How-
ever, we have tried to keep from the

THE LAST ISSUE

With this issue, The David-
sonian brings its year’s work to
a close. It had been planned to
publish two more copies before
the end of the present college
session, but unexpected compli-
cations make it advisable to dis-
continue the paper now. So ends
the fourteenth year of service to
the college. We feel that the
work of the past months has |
been of a high quality, due to the
untiring efforts of Aubrey
Brown, retiring Editor-in-Chief.
We feel that The Davidsonian|
has upheld its place on the cam-
pus and in student opinion, and
has pregared itself for a con-
tinuance of that service to its
institution. May the future be
bright.

Contemporary Thought

Realism in Debate

Debate, that chronic invalid among
college activities, may be eventually
rescued from the dry formalism of the
debate coaches by those who are in-
terested in subject matter first and the
technique of public speaking only in-
cidentally. Here and there students
are becoming interested in forensics,
not as a process of sawing the air with
carefully measured gestures and of dis-
playing a bundle of lawyer's tricks, but
rather as a means for arriving at the
truth of problems that vitally interests
the contestants.

Yale’s debate team, for instance, will
travel to Porto Rico to argue the
Platt Amendment with the students of
the island unversity. The Platt Amend-
ment is a living issue in that region
and the event will no doubt attract as
much attention there as a basketball
game does in an American university.

Another unconventional use of ora-
tory is involved in the model leagues
of nations that are held in eastern col-
leges each spring. On February 23
and 24 delegates from fourteen col-
leges of New York, Pennsylvania and
New Jersey met at Vassar to parti-
cipate in such a meeting, while in
April another meets at Mt. Holyoke
to settle the Bolivia-Paraguay boun-
dary dispute.

What would happen if this idea were
extended and the students of this hem-
isphere were called together in a Pan-
American Congress ofStudents? That
would be an accomplishment this gen-
eration of students might well be
Proud to be remembered by. The
least of its effects would be the tre-
mendous boost it gave to this new
type of debate. Far more effective
would it be in giving an international
airing to subjects that are too often
soft pedaled in conferences between
nations. We have no silly notions
about the magical ability of youth to
solve over a week-end the vexed ques-
tions of the world when older heads
have so miserably failed. Youth is as
prejudiced and Provincially minded as
age but it has the virtue of frankness
and perhaps a greater degree of will-
ingness to consider abstract ideals of
justice: rather than brute force. Cer-
tainly we ought to try one more meth-
od of spreading good will. After hay-
ing sent a “good will ambassador” out
to make neighborly calls in a battle-
ship it is not so unrealistic and roman-
tic for The New Student to urge a
conference of good will ambassadors
from the colleges and universities of
North and South America—The New

Student.

We're Just a Lot of Smart Alecks!
“The original younger generation re-
tired to the side lines quite some time
ago,” writes Cornell Woolrich of his
own coterie, in the June College Hu-
mor. “The strange little girls that you
used to see a few years ago with bushy
bobs and flapping galoshes and quills
stuck in their felt hats are mostly
mothers now. And their boy friends
with the wde, wide trousers are busy
watching the market these days.
“The whole thing has boiled itself
down to a tradition. The first out-
burst of what they love to call flaming
youth was more or less spontaneous;
ever since then it has been “pretty
much of a profession. .. And are we
unconventional at heart? Certanly not
We're really bigger slaves to conven-
tion than the most Victorian Victorians
ever were. “We go about showing off
with a sort of herd courage, because
we know everyone else is doing it at

the same time... . The pioneers among
us had their share of Personal courage.
But that was in roto... . I think it’s

about time the curtain came down on
ouract.”

B. W. A:

“Bachelor of World Affairs”’—that
is the all-embracing title of the new
degree which the Floating University
has created to crown its distinctive
type of education. The ordinary B. A.
and A M. degrees are now offered,
too, but the Bachelor of World Affairs
will be the exclusive product of that
will be the exclusive Product of that
university whase home is the billowy
deep.

When the student qualifies for this
degree he will have gained, the Float-
ing University believes, “sufficient
background in international relations
and public affairs, adequately to pre-
pare him for United States consul or
diplomatic service, or for effective
work in an international corporation.”
The degree is offered in a two-year or
four-year Program. The two-year
course, for juniors and seniors, offers
a thorough training in the fields of
History, Government, International Re-
lations, International Business, and
Sociology, all these subjects correlated
and given from the point of view of
the world as a unit. To get this de-
gree the student may take his first two
years at a land university in prepara-
tion for two years of intensive work
in the World Affairs division of the
Floating University, or he can take the
entire four years as a member of the
student body’on the yearly cruise. —
