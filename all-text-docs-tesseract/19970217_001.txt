507 Concord: residents’ testimony carries great weight

By MatrHew Eiricu
Associate Editor

Town politics and the needs of
the College clashed when the Col-
lege wanted to house eight students
on Concord Road. “And when the
dust settled, the testimony of some
members of the community carried
the day.

By December 1, according to
Director of Residence Life Kurt
Holmes, his office became aware
that there would be a shortage of
rooms for juniors returning from

abroad. Holmes asked Director of
Physical Plant Bob Collins to began
looking for alternate housing op-
tions for an overflow of eight stu-
dents. The decision was to place the
students at 507 Concord Road, and
by February 9, four students had
had to leave the house. The stu-
dents, juniors Dan Creekman, Scott
Addison, Brian Peddie, and John
McClane, moved to 109 North Th-
ompson Street. For their opinion on
the matter, see last week’s
Davidsonian, page 9.

The Process

The students were forced to
leave because of a town ordinance
which bars more than four unre-
lated individuals from living in the
same house. The College moved
the students into the house before
obtaining a variance on the ordi-

. nance.

The College contacted Town
Planner Timothy J. Keane to ask for
application materials for a Special
Use Permit which would allow eight
students to live in the house. Keane
says the College contacted his of-
fice shortly after January 1. Collins

says it was sometime in December
before Christmas. The process of
presenting a special use permit to
the Board of Adjustment takes ap-
proximately one month from initial
contact to vote, says Keane.

According to Holmes, RLO did
not know if there would be an over-
flow and, if so, how many. This
hindered any move on the College's
part, and combined with the Christ-
mas break made it nearly impos-
sible to convene the Board of Ad-
justment before January 11 when
students returned.

The finished application was
returned to Town Hall on January
13. On January 30, the Board of

- Adjustment convened to consider
the College’s application.

The Board of Adjustment is a
panel of five non-elected town resi-
dents who are appointed by the
Town Council. The members are:
Norman Richards, William
Morrison, Bill Ward (Chairman),
Don Howie, and Mike Mittelman.
In a 3-2 vote, the Board of Adjust-
ment rejected the College’s appli-

SGA chancellor and
treasurer named

By ANN CuLp
News Editor

Sophomore Ed Winant will fill
the newly created position of SGA
Treasurer and freshman Joslyn
Ogden will become the new Chan-
cellor, replacing sophomore Lee
Burnett.

The appointments were cho-
sen by SGA President Buster Burk

and Vice President Ann Harriot
Fisher and are expected to be ap-
proved by the Senate on Tuesday.
The Chancellor serves as Par-
liamentarian and is responsible for
setting the agenda. The position of
Treasurer was created from activi-
ties the Chancellor used to do. He
will maintain all financial records
and be a member of the Activities
Tax Council. Both Treasurer and
Chancellor are non-voting mem-
bers of the Senate with full floor
privileges and are full members of
the Student Executive Council.
“The Chancellor will listen to
ideas and look for loopholes. It’s a
lot of detail work,” says Ogden.

The SGA meeting for last Tues-
day was cancelled as new officials
learned their roles.

“Ttis aprecedent totake a week
off,” says Burk. “Neither the Presi-
dent, Vice President, nor Chancel-
lor are ready to jump into it yet.
We’ ve been appointing committee
and council chairs, trying to get
down parliamentary procedure, and

formulating what therycarpmight™

looklike. Starting Tuesday, though,
we are going to be going full force.”

Ogden and Winantare ready to
begin their positions.

“T want to serve the adminis-
tration above and beyond what they
ask forto exceed their expectations,”
says Ogden. “I’d also like to be the
catalyst for accomplishing tangible
things.”

“T'm really excited about work-
ing with Buster," says Winant. "He
seems like a thorough leader and a
good voice for the students.”

“T am really enthusiastic about
our team. [have a whole lot of faith
in Ann Harriot, Joslyn, and Ed,”
says Burk.

SWEET VICTORY

Swim team members break out Dr. Smooth to celebrate their Southern States title.

Teams typically celebrate a
championship by showering them-
selves in champagne, but the men’s
and women’s swimming and div-
ing teams aren’t typical. Anybody
who watched them dance, cheer,
and swim their way through the
Southern States championships
would notice that there is some-

thing special about this team.

So it really wasn’t a surprise
when they passed on the bubbly and
broke out.a couple liters of Dr.
Smooth for their victory bath after
claiming both titles on Saturday
night.

“Tf all you guys who are read-
ing this paper could hear the emo-
tion in the locker rooms right now,
it’s one of the things I love about
Davidson,” senior Bo Craig said

immediately following his final
meet as a Wildcat. “It’s a small
school, and yet we can do some-
thing as incredible as this.”

The men led throughout the
meet, adding to their lead in each
of the three nights, but the women
had to vault over Louisville,
Evansville, and Georgia Southern
to take their first Southern States

The Trustee Committee voted
to approve co-educational residence
buildings for next year when they
met recently. :

Little and Cannon Dorms will
remain single-sex with one-half
being freshmen and the other half
upperclassmen.

Due to fixed furniture,
Richardson will house only first
year students.

There were increased problems
with housing for freshmen this year

when 18 women lived in triples
while rooms remained empty on
male halls.

“We hope to be very clear that

we will try to pair people where ~

they want,” says Residence Life
Director Kurt Holmes. “Housing
for entering freshman is going to be
a real gamble, though. Residence
Life will have to look at another
level of selection. when pairing
roommates.” ’

In an RLO survey in the fall,
65% of 360 respondents said they
would have liked to live in co-ed
buildings.

“We couldn’t make this public
until we ran it by the Trustees,” says
Holmes. “We’ve had to do student
surveying in ahypothetical format.”

While RLO continues to work
out the details of how to divide
Belk, potential partitions would be
the only physical changes to any
buildings.

“Communities are better when
peers act on a brother-sister level
rather than ‘us and them.’ Damage
reports are lower in co-ed build-
ings. But most importantly, the

student cry is that we at least at-
tempt this,” says Holmes.
