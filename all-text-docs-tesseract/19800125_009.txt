The Thundering Herd of
Marshall University left David-
son on tender feet after a big
Wildcat win Monday. night in
Johnston Gym. The Cats
turned a 115-97 defeat earlier in
the year into a total rout,
winning 81-53. Jamie Hall led a
balanced scoring attack with 12
points, but more importantly,
he pulled down 13 rebounds.

Many of the elements of team
play the Cats have been search-
ing for all season surfaced
against Marshall. Recently,
Davidson has been plagued by
inconsistent effort which led to
close losses like Saturday night
against UT-Chattanooga. As of
late other games have gotten
out of hand in the last minutes
such as the recent Citadel game
where the Cats dropped a 12
point lead in the second half.

Consistency is the key to
maintaining control and win-
ning games. Coach Eddie Bie-
denbach credited Hall’s ‘‘con-
sistent hard effort’’ as a major
element of the victory as well as
a “solid strong effort out of
everybody else.”

No doubt, the Cats will have
to depend on a ‘‘consistent hard
effort’’ by everyone tonight
against St. John’s in New York.
Biedenbach feels that the Red-
men will be the Cats toughest
oppenent all season. With a
number eight rahking in the
nation, St. Johns will be stiff
competition even against a su-
perb Davidson effort.

‘“‘We’d like to keep the game
close and ring a few free shots at
the end to win the game,”’

Biedenbach said. “If we win, it
certainly won't be by a romp.”

After the 61-59 last second |

loss to UT-Chattanooga and the
Marshall win, the Cats have a
3-6 Southern Conference record
and a 6-10 overall record.
Davidson currently is seventh
in the league, but Biedenbach
points out that his team could
be third had they defeated VMI
and UT-Chattanooga. The Cats
lost these two games by a total
of three points.

“Anybody has a possibility
for the number three through
nine spots in the conference
right now,” Biedenbach said.
“But we have to win the rest of
our games to get into the upper
part of the league; it’s really
important for the seeding of the
tournament,” he added.

Davidson gets a shot at two
conference foes this coming
week. The Cats travel to Wes-
tern Carolina Monday night;
the teams met previously, and
Davidson dropped a disappoint-
ing five-point game. Appala-
chian State visits the Coliseum
next Wednesday night.

Besides winning and break-
ing a four-game losing streak,
the Marshall victory as welcome
for other reasons. ‘‘We needed a
game,’’ Biedenbach said,
‘‘where we could have some
freedom—a game where we
could play with ‘reckless aban-
don under control’.”’

“This team has character,”
he said. ‘‘The guys had some
tough losses, but they keep
working together. A good atti-
tude and hard work leads to
winning and fun. We’re going to
get it all turned around.”
