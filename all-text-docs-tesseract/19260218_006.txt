Coach Younger sounded the call to

Laird and Huie Lead Attack in
Scoring 22 Points in Last Half

(Special to Daily News)

The Purple Hurricane of Furman Univer-
sity continued its triumphant march through
North Carolina Saturday night by defeating
Davidson 40 to 33. Brabham, sharp-shooter
of Billy Laval’s quint, ran wild in the first
half and gave the visitors a commanding lead
that the fighting Wildcats could not over-
come in the second half, although they played
the South Carolina quint ‘off its feet in the
last stages of the contest.

Furman swept off into a quick lead and
with Grabham caging baskets from all cor-
ners of the court quickly rolled up a score
on Davidson, Many of the shots caged by
Brabham and his teammates came from back
of the foul line. The visitors gave the pret-
tiest exhibition of long-distance shooting
scen on the local floor this year.

When the half ended Furman led, 26 to 11,
but the Wildcats came back strong and with
Laird leading the attack scored 22 points to
14 for Furman. Brabham was smothered
throughout the final period and could not
get loose to uncork his bewildering tosses.

‘Two Football Games to
Play in Game Saturday

Black and Wells to Captain the
Opposing Teams

The first spring football game of the year
for the Davidson Wildeats will be played
!next Saturday afternoon on Richardson Field
jat 2:30 o'clock between the “Reds” and the
“Blacks.” This contest comes at the close
of the first three weeks of the spring prac-
tice period.

Coach Tilson announced the early part of
!the week that the squad had been divided
and gave out a prospective lin¢-up. The two
teams are head by two football captains,

\“Wick” Black, captain of the Wildcat eleven

of last year, leading the “Blacks,” and Lu-
cian Wells, captain-elect of Davidson's 1926
machine, in charge of the “Reds.” Nine let-
ter men are scheduled to start the game.
Five Freshmen, most of whom made numer-
als on the Wildkitten aggregation last fall,
will start their first varsity game.

Halfway

This game comes at the end of the half-
way mark in the spring training period, as
Coach Tilson has announced that work will
continue until the middle of March, with
regular Saturday afternoon games each
week. No game with an outsidér, such as
was played with Hickory Athletic club last
‘year, will be attempted this spring.

Assisting Coach Tilson, in teaching these
men, some 55 in all, the rudiments of the
game, have been Freshman Coach Mattox,
Tom Baker, star tackle of last fall, and
“Rosy” McMillan.

Hendrix Referee
J. P. Hendrix, for four years one of the
mainstays in the Davidson backfield, will
referee, The other officials will be announc-
ed later.
The two teams, announced by Coach Til-
son, that will start the game are as follows:

“Blacks” Position. “Reds”

In addition to these men a number will
more than likely. have a chance to get into
the game. Included in this list are: For the
“Blacks: James, Black, S., Davis, Baker,
A. W., Green, Ritchie, Smith, E. H.; and
forthe “Reds”: Overton, Covington, Jen-
nings, T., Campbell, Christian, Allen, Law-

GLEE CLUB TO START

(Continued from page 1)
to make the trip, and in view of the splen-
did work done so far, it seems certain that
an excellent showing will be made on the
tour and also in the contest. Talent is avail-
able to a greater extent than ever before,
finances are in good shape, and all roads
point to very successful work during the rest
of the year.

baseball practice Monday and a large
representation was present and there
are still more to come from the sports of
basketball and football which are still in
full swing of practice. Prospects for
this year are somewhat brighter than
last year since there are a number of
last year’s men back and some promising
recruits from last year’s squad of fresh-
men.

The pitchers will be about the same
with the addition of Oden who came up
from last year’s freshmen. His brother
who pitched for the varsity last year
will be back at the same old job. Laird
with his added experience should be bet-
ter than ever while Hampton should have
developed some new stuff.

The infield is at present a matter of
speculation as Covington, J. W., Alford,
and Simpson are missing. “Abe” Kugler
it is rumored will be tried at short with
Woodham going back to his original
position at first base. The other posi-
tions are open for all comers and will
present the greatest difficulties.

In the outfield Vance will back
with all the hitting power of old and
Davis is also looking good in the early
workouts. The other positions a
matter of more speculation and adds to
the problems of the coaching staff.

If rumor is to be believed Frank Al-
ford will be behind the plate when play
is called forthe first game.

Much hard work is in view for all con-
cerned and ift%s possible through work
to produce a winning team Coach
Younger expects to have one.

Fraternity Basketball

Initiated at Davidson

Eleven Teams Begin Practice Games
in Race for Championship

With interest beginning to fag in
basketball as the end of the season ap-
proaches and the beginning of baseball
practice, the followers .of the cage game
are promised.a treat in the coming inter-
fraternity basketball tournament. This
is the first time a contest of this sort has
ever been attempted but with the ap-
parent interest that is being taken by
the fraternities a success is assured,

The contest was suggested by a fra-

ternity member and the suggestion was

enthusiastically approved of by all the
groups. Both national and local frater-
nities will participate, eleven teams hav-
ing been formed and managers appointed.
The managers met in the parlor of Watts
Saturday and schedules for practice and
for games were drawn up.

An elimination series will be played.
The first series° will be over by Saturday
February 2oth, and the winners in this
series will go into the semi-finals and
finals, while the losers in the first week's
Play will participate in the semi-finals
for places. The eliminations will be over
by February 27th and after a probable
three-day rest the winners will go into
the finals.

Yearly Custom

Tf this contest proves a success it will
doubtless mean a revival of many in-
tra-mural sports that for the past few
years have apparently died down. The
interest that is being taken in it makes it
appear that it may equal inter-class base-
ball and basketball and as all local con-
tets meet with the approval of the stu-
dent body there is no reason why_ it
should not become a yearly custom. At
any rate there is going to be a nip and
tuck battle for the victory this year as
every team is putting forth every effort
to be a winner and each is being backed
strongly by its fellow fraternity brothers.

C. E. TRAINING CLASS

The Christian-Endeavor Training class
on Sunday at the regular hour held a>
‘very interesting meeting. The subjects
for discussion were, the duties and func- |
tions of a secretary and treasurer of a

Anderson and Huie Star for
Wildcats in Brilliant
Exhibition

Led by the spectacular shooting of
Tom Anderson in the last half, backed
up by the consistent playing of the en-
tire Davidson Wildcat aggregation, the
proteges of Monk Younger last night
played a brillant brand of the cage art,
to defeat.the Charlotte “Y” cagers, 42 to
39.

Only a few spectators were present to
witness, that will perhaps be one of the
best court games this season by either
aggregation,

Several times the lead changed hands

during the first period, and six times dur--

ing the last half the score was knotted,
the Wildcats, however, maintaining the
lead when there was one in existence.

First Blood

Davidson drew the first field goal,
Charlotte tieing a moment later. The
Linkmen then forged ahead, and were
leading, 6 to 4, before the Wildcats
started a rally that sent them to the
front, 11 to 6,

Charlotte looped four baskets and
lead, 14 to 11, but the team of Monk
Younger shot several field goals in quick
succession to lead at half time, 19 to 14.

Andrews Star
The second period was well under way,
with
the shooting of Andrews started. It was
a field goal by Andrews and then one by
Anderson for Davidson, with the score
being tied six times during this period,

Reed of the “Y” team shooting a field

goal just before the whistle blew.

The playing of Huie for the Wildcats

was the most consistent in the game, this

player ringing seven field goals, but the |

glamour of his performance diminished
slightly as compared to the comeback of
Anderson for Davidson and Andrews
for Charlotte. —

One Goal

Andrews chalked up only on field goal
the first half, Anderson accounting for
three points for Davidson but both these
men changed their tactics, displaying
rare form, for Anderson made 12 points
during the last period, Anderson dittoing
this performance.
