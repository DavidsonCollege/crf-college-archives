Jackson’s New Mural
Shown By Fraternity

Senior Herb Jackson, whose
paintings have been placed on
the Union’s walls, has complet-
ed a mural at the Alpha Tau
Omega house.

“The mural,’” said Jackson,
“is very difficult to paint for
several reasons. It is painted
on such a large scale that the
painter must consider the pres-
ence of people in the room, how
it will appear to them from near
or far away, the lighting in the
room and other external fac-
tors.”

Because such a fast-drying

paint must be used, the artist
has to be positive in his ap-
proach and must have a general
idea of what he wants to paint.
There is, however, no thematic
content in the mural.

“The mural has no name be-
cause I find names very confus-
ing and limiting.

“I give my paintings names
only because it is more conven-
ient in handling them. Because
a painting is its own entity, it
should be able to exist cn its
own merit,” Jackson said.

Jackson further explained the

COMING SPEAKERS

Doolin To
Red China

Headlining next week's chapel
speakers will be Dr. Dennis Doo-
lin, one of the YMCA's Great
Issues Speakers for this semes-
ter.

Doolin, who comes from the
Hoover Institute at Stanford Uni-
versity, is currently an advisor
on Far Eastern affairs in Wash-
ington. In keeping with the YM.
CA's general topic of social rev-
olution, Doolin will give an ob-
jective analysis of Red China in
chapel Monday.

On Tuesday. Roger Conklin,
naturalist, lecturer, television
perscnality and author, is sched-
uled to speak on ‘‘The Challeng-
ing World of Inner Space.”

Consider
Situation

Acclaimed by audiences and
the press alike, Conklin has
been a frequent guest on the tele-
vision shows of Jack Paar. John-
ny Carson and Mike Douglas. He
has traveled throughout the U.S.
and abroad and has made over
100 appearances a year while
serving as director of public re-
_lations at the Seaquarium in Mi-
ami for nearly 10 years.

Thursday's speaker will be the
Rev. Dan Duraway. associate
minister at Covenant Presby-
terian Church in Charlotte. He
will present a summary of the
thoughts of Tehland Chardin. a
Jesuit theologian who wrote The
Phenomencn of Man. concerning
evolution and theology.

stages he has gone through since
he began serious painting nine

years ago. He began with land. :’%

scapes and still scenes, then por
traits. He next tried interpreta-
tions and now does restatements.

Apologetic for having to speak
in artistic language. Jackson ex-

plained that restatement means -

that he creates a new entity by
restatement of form. His paint-
ings find meaning in their own
existence.

As chairman and sole member
of the Union Art Committee.
Jackson is now displaying in the
College Union several paintings
by Miss Laura Grosch, a senior
at Wellesley College.

This is the second show of
paintings which has been pre-
sented in the Union. The exhibit
will remain on display until
Christmas. The first show con-
sisted of several paintings done
by Jackson himself. A review of
his works from 1962-1965 is now
on exhibit at Wellesley College.

In trying to characterize the
work of Miss Grosch, Jackson
explained that she is a symbol.
ist painter who has been influ-
enced by three trends in art:
German expressionism, primi-
tive folk art, and art nouveau.
Her symbols are very personal,
not universal, and it is not often
easy to determine the meaning.

Both these painters plan to
attend graduate school in fine
arts next year.

Miss Brosch’'s paintings on ex-
hibit at the Union are on sale
at prices ranging from $50 to
$150. Jackson said his paintings
usually sell for $50 to $500.

Ecumenical Institute Captures

Tenor Of 20th Century Society

By MIKE BATES
Staff Writer

Eight Davidson students re-
turned Monday from a weekend
at Chicago’s Ecumenical Insti-
tute. They were not the same
students who left the previous
Wednesday.

The Institute’s program con-
sists of two parts: one is the
training of laymen and clergy-
men on week nights and week-
ends; the other is their Fifth
City project. a deyelopment pro-
gram for the Negro ghetto
around the Institute.

Eight Davidson students. a
a Duke Divinity School student.
and one clergyman made the
trip. Those attending were Frank
Goldsmith, Dave Hardeman.
Bob Howard. Bobby Lane and
Robert Pyeatt.

Also attending were Paul
Schneider, Jim Shackleford.
Mike Bates, Don Davis of Duke
and the Rev, Paul Lowder. pas-
tor of the Davidson Methodist
Church. The trip was sponsored
by the Davidson Methodist: Stu-
dent Fellowship.

‘Opinions about the Institute
varied, but all were impressed
by the radical commitment and
total dedication of the Institute's
staff. “I had never seen any-
thing like it before,’ commented
Howard, and several other stu-
dents added their agreement.

WORSHIP

A morning worship at 6:30
a.m., which most of the delega-
tion found strange at first, was
held in an unheated gymnasium.
The Institute staff continually
rocked rhythmically back and
forth during the service, and
persons who had. worshipped pre-
viously at the Institute joined
them.

A “dance of joy” involv: ag a
rock and roll-like hand clapping
was another unusual part of the
worship. A staff member later
explained that the Institute is

continually experimenting in new
—

forms of worship; the rocking.
and the clapping were attempts
to involve the total person in the
act of. corporate worship.

In the second tecture, there
was an ccntinual emphasis on
the sentence, ‘To live is to die,
and to die is to live,”* which the
Institute considers the heart of
the New Testament. Short pa-
pers by Bultmann, TiNich, Bon-
hoeffer and Niebuhr were dis-
cussed during the weekend.

eatirely supported by contribu-
tioas from individuals, but none
of these donations are used for

aries from weekday jobs are
