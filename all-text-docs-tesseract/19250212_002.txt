. Ihe TATE-

Yearling Quint Defeats

Brown, Wilson and McColgan go
Good in Opening Game as Fresh
Win 31-19 and 45-30

The Davidson Wildkittens won over the
Concord High School basketball team in a
slow game by a 28 to 13 score on the local
floor Saturday night. The Kittens started
the game off with some nice offensive work
that brought the score up to 12 to 4 at the
end of the first quarter. The second quarter
was slow, neither team showing up very
well, and while the Freshmen were scoring
four points, the Concord team scored two.

Again at the beginning of the second half
the locals made an offensive spurt and
brought the score up to 23, but in the last
quarter they seemed to lose their pep, finding
the basket for only five points.

The defense of both teams was good. The
High Schoolers played the last period largely
on the defense. Brown and McColgan were
high scorers for the Davidson team and
Easley was the leading offense man of the
Concord team. Milner was out of the game
a large part of the time with minor injuries.

The line-up:

Right guard

Left guard

Substitutions—Davidson: Maulden (2) for
McColgan; Milner (4) for Hall; Boyles for
Wilson; McAuley for Harrison; Upton for
Brown; Weld for Milner; Morris for Weld.
Concord: Mabrey for Simpson.

Referee: Tilson (Davidson).

blood, and another strong quint has gone
down before these youngsters of Coach
Rawson. Last Tuesday evening was the
date of Mooresville High’s downfall, to the
tune of the rather lopsided score of 31-19.

While the game had its exciting moments,
on the whole it was a rather listless, “happy-
go-lucky” affair; it became rather rough
when the play on both sides grew more
ragged than ever. However, be as it may,
Coach Rawson will soon have his team in
trim to meet the pick of the state teams.
The team goes on a four-day trip the latter
part of the month, when their chief rivals
will be played: Oak Ridge, Trinity, Wake
Forest and State will be encountered.

[Queen City to Witness
__ Wildcat-Tech Contest

, Varsity Quint Then Takes Road for
| Trip Through Virginia—Then

| Wake Forest

| The hardest portion of the basketball
| schedule is now facing the Wildcat team.
Within the next 15 days there are 10 games
scheduled with the best teams in the South.
' Davidson has a chance to make an excellent
| showing throughout the Southern States if
\she defeats all of her opponents. There are
several games that will test the calibre of the
| Wildcats to the highest degree, All of the
| games are with teams that have proven their
worth already during the first part of the
season,

The first game will be with Georgia Tech
in Charlotte on Tuesday night. This is the |
beginning of the long trip scheduled for the |
team. Tech has an excellent team this year |
and the Wildcats will have to fight hard to
prove their superiority. After this game one
is scheduled with the strong Guilford quint |
on the next night. |

While in Virginia the Wildcat five will)
encounter the strongest teams there, among |
these being V. P. I., Washington and Lee, |
Hampden-Sidney, and Roanoke, The Wild- |
cats return to Davidson to wind up the season |
in the latter part of February. Guilford |
College will be met again then and to wind |
up the season Wake Forest is placed on the |.
menu.

If Davidson passes through the rest of the |
season as victorious as she has already been, |
it will have been a most successful season. }
It has been very good even this far, not-
withstanding the defeats by Wake Forest
and Carolina.

Tennis Schedule is
Greatly Changed

Owing to the change in the dates of the
Easter holidays, Manager Beall was forced
to completely change the Wildcat tennis
schedule for the trip East. The dates of the
holidays were changed to April 9-13 in-
clusive and since these dates conflicted with
the trip. as previously arranged, the meets
had to be booked to conform with the
changes,

The Wildcat court crew will lock horns
with the following schools: They meet the
University of Maryland at College Park,
Md., on April 21; Navy at Annapolis, Md.,
the following day; the University of Vir-
ginia at Charlottesville on April 23; and
wind up with the strong Winston-Salem
Country Club aggregation. Clemson College
will be metshere on April 19, and a hot con-
test bids fair to ensue.

This change in the schedule, although it
seems somewhat less extensive than at first
planned, will, in reality, make possible the
stay of four or five days at the annual state
tourney, which takes place May 8-15.

have some one to throw them over by the
time regular practice opens.

One fellow said that the reason Davidson
didn’t win any more baseball games last sea-
son than they did was on account of “Til-
son’s and Oden’s wild pitching making them
bat-shye.”

OES p AEE

With Boker, Bohannon and Pinkney back

along with Arrowood and several other likely

men from the Fresh eleven the ends ought to
be fairly well covered next season.

—D.

If Tilson’s spring training does as much

good as it did last year the Davidson team

should stand pretty well in the coming

autumn,

One Off Night for
Quints in Eleven

Playing Georgia Tech in Charlotte on next
Tuesday night, the Wildcats set a record for
the past few years in fighting through 10
basketball games in 11 days. The team after
meeting Tech and Guilford, swings off
through the Old Dominion where some of
the classiest teams of the Cavalier State are
met one after another. With only Sunday to
rest on, the Davidson quint will return to
Carolina to play Wake Forest in Charlotte
on the 26th, and then to their own lair, where
Guilford and the Baptists will furnish the
wind-up of the North Carolina basketball
season for 1925.
