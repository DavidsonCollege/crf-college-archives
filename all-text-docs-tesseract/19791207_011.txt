and 17 supported one. Similarly, 35
professors rejected the idea of the
Administration's using a completely
standardized form. Thirteen said they
would be satisfied under such circum-
stances.

Zimmermann said that if every faculty
member devised his own form, ‘‘I
wouldn’t be able to compare them.” One
professor in the poll wrote that the
evaluation form he uses in his classes,
though valuable to him, would not be
useful to the Administration.

‘Some element of uniformity and
consistency must be present (in evalua-
tion forms),’’ Zimmermann said:

McKelway, however, opposes any
standardized form: “Evaluation of peo-
. ple is never done easily. The. greatest
danger is to believe that simple, easily

gathered instruments provide srctiracy
of judgment,”

said, ‘‘I think it reveals basically what I
expected: (the Faculty wants) manda-
tory evaluation but not through a
uniform questionnaire.”

Zimmermann feels the variety of
possible evaluation systems is limited.
“I don’t share the view that there are
many other options. I am convinced that
this (the ICES form) was the most
flexible and informative system that we
are likely to find.”

Several faculty members suggested
that those who rejected the ICES forms
bear some responsibility for selecting an
alternative system. McKelway sug-
gested that evaluation is best conducted
through a variety of means. He men-
tioned use of short forms (like the ICES
form), student essays,'class discussions;
information from recent alumni, and
consultation with departmental majors.

“I think the list could fo on a good bit

about different ways: to go about it,”

McKelway said. ““you need to use

French Professor Charles Dockery
said, ‘‘Any evaluation system must
allow for open-ended questions.”’ How-
ever, professors were split almost evenly
on whether open-ended questions should
be used in place of standardized forms.:

One professor who responded nega- |

tively faulted: the. questionnaire’s
wording. He said he opposed open-ended
question’s replacing standardized forms.
but he favored such questions being used
in conjunction with such forms.

The Trustees had specified in the minutes
of their October 1972 meeting that, since a
radio station had a ‘public relations”’
aspect, WDAV’s p should be
“closely and contin supervised by
the College Administration,”

The 1976 College Constitution, however,
had listed WDAV as a student organization
governed by the Student Media Board. As
a student organization, the station had
received money from the Activities Tax
Council.

The transition to high power was made in
June 1978. In October the Trustees voted to
remove the students from WDAV’s admini-
stration and to hire professional staffers,
possibly including qualified students. The
station’s programming would be “primarily
classical.’’ The student staff of WDAV
resigned in protest.

The furor of accusations and justifica-
tions which followed died down, and
WDAV went back into operation in its
present form on December 2, 1978.

Now, Mcintyre said, there are about 15
paid student staff members.

According to a September 1978 state-
ment by President Spencer, one of the
purposes of a high-power classical station
was to “generate long term general sup-
port”’ for the College.

McIntyre said that it is too early to
expect such support. ‘‘Long term means
10-15-20 years. It takes time for a station to

get established. Ultimately, what we hope . 0
is that people will] support the College |

simply because of the public service the
station renders.”

candidtes filed only after some

Dean of Students: Will Terry
pointed out that there have
been such problems with elec-
tions before. He thought one of
the reasons for the poor
response may be the scheduling
of elections in the busy three
weeks between Thanksgiving
and Christmas.

Terry suggested that it may
be better to have elections only
twice a year; in the spring
and the fall.

WDAV

‘Another reason cited by the Trustees
for the changeover was the need for a
classical music station in the Charlotte
area. This spring, UNCC’s WFAE, which
.broadcasts classical, jazz, and educational
programs, will increase its power from 10 to
100,000 watts.

When asked if this would affect WDAV’s
purpose, McIntyre said, ‘There is room for
several public stations in the Charlotte
area. I hope we will complement each
other.”

WFAE’s Program Director Chris Wright
said that when the station increases
broadcast time to 18 hours, it will keep its
classical music broadcasting at its present
level of 12 hours.’’ probably jazz will be
increaséd,’’ he said.

Wright said he is considering McIntyre’s
suggestion that WFAE play classical music
after 10pm,.when WDAV switches to jazz,
instrumental, and rock. However, he said,
“you have to compete. We don’t want to
lose our audience by switching back and
forth from jazz to classical.”

McIntyre said he hopes WDAV will
eventually ‘‘Branch out”’ in new areas, such
as’ local news. ‘‘But we will remain
essentially a classical station for a long
while to come,” he added.

If the system is approved, Coleman said,
“IT hope we can start ordering equipment,
work out our staff organization, and be on
the air by spring term.’

The station would probably be located in
the basement of Belk dormitory.

225 students answered a survey concer-
ning the carrier current system distributed
last week, according to Coleman. 74.5% of
those who responded felt that the carrier
current radio would benefit the entire
student body, and 48% indicated there was
a.considerable or great need for.such a
station. 82.3% said they would spend 25%

or more of their radio listening time tuned —

in to the college station.

The campus station’s programming,

Coleman said, would be “really varied—
what people want.” She said the group _

plans to conduct another poll dealing

exclusively with programming. -

“As far as I’m concerned,” Melatyre
said, ‘‘the carrier current station is a fine
