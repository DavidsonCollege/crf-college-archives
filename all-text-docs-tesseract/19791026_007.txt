International connections in center

Ever have a case of Potomac
Fever? It is a rare political
disease peculiar to Washington
bureaucrats and diplomats. It is
particulary common among
U.S. Foreign Service men who
have spent years away from
their homeland.

Talk to Richard Naas some-
time; he’ll tell you all about
Potomac Fever. Mr. Naas has
served abroad in the Foreign
’ Service for 24 distinguished
years. He is the Diplomat-In-
Residence here at Davidson for
the 1979-80 academic year.

So what is a man like Charles
Naas, who has travelled the
world over (Pakistan, Calcutta,
India, Turkey, Iran) doing in a
small town like Davidson N.C.?
Apparently he is curing his
Potomac Fever.

“T am renewing my connec-
tion with America...too often
diplomats lose contact with
their homeland and forget just
what makes it tick.” Mr. Naas
is catching up on a lot of
reading in hopes of rediscover-
ing America.

Charles Naas is one of nine
Diplomats-In-Residence on this
year's U.S. campuses who offer
their expertise and experience
to college students. You can
thank Vice President Zimmer-
man for getting him here.

Mr. Naas is giving lectures in
Dr. Thomas’ history course this
term and will be teaching his
own seminar in Foreign Policy
winter term.

Besides working and study-
ing at Davidson, he will also be
lecturing to other local schools
and special interest groups.

. Mr. Naas was most recently
Deputy Chief of Mission and
Charge d’ Affaires at the Ameri-
can Embassy in Tehran, Iran.
He was present when Iranian
revolutionary gunmen seized
the American ‘Embassy last

February. -
Mr. Naas remembers the

Fortunately they (the gunmen)
never intended to kill us.”

So go and meet this man;
take advantage of this oppor-
tunity to talk with him. His
office is on the second floor in
the Center for Special Studies.
Tell Charles Naas what is on
your mind and help him cool
down his Potomac Fever.

His African involvements
have in turn generated a strong
interest in France; he is current-
ly arranging to have a course on
the economics of France offered
soon, feeling that this would
contribute to our already strong
interdisciplinary program with
France.

and interests are travel, music,
cooking, and gardening.

When asked of his opinions of

Davidson he commented that,

in addition to enjoying the
small town atmosphere, “I like
the sense of community that the
college. seems to have. The
friendly.”

Diplomat Charles s Naas enjoys talking about hia adventures in

intense drama Andorra opens s :

By JIM NORTHRUP
‘ Staff Writer
Andorra, a drama by Max
Frisch, will open Thursday

-_night for the students of David-
.. son College. A premiere for this

section of the country, the play
has been a standard in Euro-
pean theatres since the early
1960’s. It has not fared as well
in the United States, and up
until now has remained some-
what obscure except to students
of German literature. This will
be the first major production of

the season for the Davidson .

College Theatre Department.

An intense drama, Andorra is
concerned with bigotry and
national chauvinism. It is a bit
heavier and deeper than recent
Theatre Department product-
ions. It promises to be one of
the most thoughtful produc-
tions ever presented on the

_ Davidson stage. Perhaps it will

also have a more serious effect
on the audience, though its pur-
pose is not to preach. It is a
modern play which takes place
in a fictional country called
Andorra and deals with a young
man’s search for his identity, as
well as his relationship to the

people around him. Directed by -

Dr. Rupert T. Barber, Jr.,
Chairman of the Theatre De-
partment, and designed by
Joseph T. Gardner, Assistant
Professor in Theatre, the play
promises to be a powerful one.

“With the upsurge of blatant
intolerance in our country, the
openness with which certain or-

ganized groups promote their —

prejudices, the current cam-

(Michael Kehs)

paign against people who follow
life-styles different from the
majority’s and specifically the
recent vandalism ‘of a synago-
gue in Charlotte, we felt it-was
time to do this play,” Barber
said in a recent interview.
“Although the play is spe-
cifically about anti-semitism, I
believe it is about all intolerance
blacks, Jews, gays, what-have-
you. This is an ‘it-could-hap-
pen-here’ play. It is a hard
hitting drama, a needler of’
conscience and a pitiless ier
after the truth.”’
The Theatre Department has

of the local community, has
been working since mid-Sep-

day at 7:30 pm and Friday and

‘Saturday at 8:00 in Hodson

Hall this week and next. Tic-
kets are on sale at the Cunning-
ham box office for $1.50.

1979 national championship sparks
interest in intramural College Bow! -

By TIM NEWCOMB
Staff Correspondent

On June 6 Davidson’s College
Bowl team defeated Harvard
University 405-110 to win the
1979 national championship.
This victory climaxed a long
road for the team. The reward
was a trip to England to face a
British championship team, re-
sulting in a narrow loss to
Sidney Sussex College and a
great experience for all of -us.
The 1979-80 College Bowl sea-
son began at Davidson oman
intramural level on October 1.
From this intramural tourna-
ment an intercollegiate team
will be chosen, and will set out

to defend Davidson’s national

championship.
College Bowl is a quiz game

‘jointly sponsored by the Read-

er’s Digest and by the Associa-
tion of College Unions Interna-
tional. Its content is not strictly
intellectual, nor is it a question
of knowing meaningless triv-
ia— the key to the game is the
ability to instantly recall specif-
ic facts. That ability was shared
by Tom Ruby’ and James Gi-
bert, both ‘79, and Ed Trumbull
and Tim Newcomb, ‘81;

College Bow] at Davidson has
been very fortunate to have
strong support from the College
Union.

Collins have been responsible
for its relatively smooth opera-
tion. A College Bowl committee
has been created on the Union.

continuity from year to-year.

This year the College Bowl
committee received an initial
budget 0f$500.00 to use for the
year’s operations. Most ofthis
money will go to the purchase of

large-scale tournament. Other —
programs which College Bowl
has produced this year have
been a preseritation at Home-
coming Weekend, and exhibi-
tion matches at Parents’ Week-
end.

Davidson’s present intramur-
al tournament began October 1
and is still in its early stages.
There are four leagues of six
teams each, with each team
playing all the other teams in its
league once. The winner of each
league- will then enter a playoff
tournament to determine the
intramural champion. After
Christmas, tryouts for the var- ~
sity team will begin. After our
varsity team is picked we hope
to host an intercollegiate tourn-
ament larger than last year’s
four-team tilt.. Despite the loss
of three members of its champ-
ionship team, Davidson will be
among the favorites in the
regional competition once a-
gain.

Despite the fact that College
Bowl is considered relatively
big-time at Davidson, in the
intramurals there is still a place
for a lot of :pure enjoyment
without high pressure. The
