Unification , not division needed

To the Editor:

The recent events on Patterson
Court—notably the controversy over
Rusk House and this year’s self-
selection—have stirred up quite a bit
of discussion and even animosity The
polarity between, Davidson’ Ss “wo
systems of social organization —the
eating houses and the frifternities—-
seems to have been intensified. This is
to me a very disturbing situation.
This kind of division is very destruc-
tive on a campus the size of Davidson.

Most of us, including myself, had
rather strong opinions on the Rusk
House issue; some of us were pleased

' with last week’s decision and some of
us were disappointed. But since the
decision I have realized something I
hope people on both sides of the issue
will see uriequivocally, That is,that
the women’s house has potential for
good or bad. If it remains a new
option of diet and expression for the
women it will have proved itself
helpful. However, if it degenerates
into an exclusive club, then it will

divide not 4 the women and
Patterson Court but the whole cam-
pus as well. If we all admit this dual
potential from the start, then we can
work to control it for the good.
More generatty than the Rusk
House issue, though, the whole
Patterson Court situation has reached
an important crossroad. It too has
dual potential to become either a
stronger, more pleasant part of the
Davidson social scene or to degener-
ate into the most destructive and
disunifying social factor here. The
two Patterson Court power blocks
(national and non-national) must
start cooperating better. Sure, there
are real differences in outlook of the
nationals and non-nationals; to deny
this would be destructively foolish
and non-realistic. However, the
things that unite us at Davidson are
more numerous and more important.
We should try to work together more
on expressing our common interests
(e.g. parties, improvement of houses,
finding more room for freshmen) and

Honor Code fails

To the Editor:

We often wonder about Hunan
nature and the motives behind mans”
actions. At Davidson College the
attitudes toward honor and responsi-
bility supposedly lie in a region where
individuals think about the conse-
quences of their deeds, rather than
acting blindly on a whim or fancy.
Apparently this is not so.

Saturday, January 29, the resi-
dents of fourth Cannon held an open
party at Rusk House. Everyone was
welcome and free food and beverages
were provided. We were thanked for
our time and effort by having over 200
dollars worth of personal property
stolen.

We are not condemning the Honor
Code or the Code of Responsibility;
however it is unfortunate that they
are better in theory th ractice.
Such declarations as these can only be
as valid or as strong as the students
who come under their influence make
them. Even though a great majority

of the students strive to abide by
these documents it only takes a few
people, deviants from the majority, to
breed suspicion and mistrust in the
lives of Davidson students. If this
happens, the Honor Code will not be
worth the paper that it is written on.

Maybe we took the Honor Code
too seriously and were due for a
sudden awakening from our naivete of
simple trust to the problems of the
real world. NowJwe question the
usefulness of the Honor Code since it
has lulled us into a false sense of
security and we had to learn the truth
the hard way. I regret that there is a
need to write this letter, however it is
our intention to warn our fellow
students about the trap that we have
fallen into. Even if the individuals
who took our belongings are caught
and punished, I do not believe that
any of us will ever regain complete
faith in the Honor Code again.

aecept and tolerate our nr as
relatively less important (for the
whole college , anyway) expressions of
individuality. I believe that™ national
and non-national houses can coexist
in harmony here.

Already being planned for spring
are several activities which would
draw support and cooperation from
both nationals and non-nationals. The
methods initially may seem superfi-
cial, but the unifying effects can be
substantial. I would like to ask
everyone, when these events come,
please, support them enthusiastical-

ly. I would like to ask also that the
powers that be recognize that Ruck
House will not be the last house to
apply for Patterson Court status on
our growing campus. A little fore-
sight in developing a policy on the
creation of new houses might spare us
future controversies.

In effect, all I am asking is that we
a? work on having a little more kind
and understanding attitudes toward
each other.

SAE’ dance open

To the Editor:

As the social chairmen of SAE, we
would like to take this opportunity to
clear up a few misconceptions about
the dance which the SAE’s are
sponsoring Thursday night. A lot of
people have asked us about the dance,
and more than a few of them appear to
have heard some misinformation.

First, the dance is open, and
anyone from Davidson, or elsewhere,
is welcome to attend. It will be from 9
pm until 1 am in the gym. ‘“Janice”’ is
the name of the band which will be
playing. “Janice” is a very popular

Davidsonian exhibits feminism

To the Editor:
Re: The editorial in last week’s
Davidsonian by Cathy Landis.

As Editor of The Davidsonian, you
are charged with a responsibility that
you do not seem to be taking very
seriously. I'am referring to the
discussion in the last issue about the
ratio of women to men at Davidson
and their levels of intelligence. The
point that I disagree with is in the
article expressing your opinion and
also in the article by Tom Engle. It is
appropriate that your opinion is
reflected in an editorial, but you need

to be more in formulating your
opinions from going off on
tangents. Nowjwhile you refrained

from writing your opinion into an
article, you allowed the same unsub-
stantiated opinion to be expressed in
the article by Tom Engle.

You stated that, “If application
trends persist, competition for admis-
sion for women will be fiercer than it

is for men. The quality of the women
will surpass the men.’’ This is a gross
exaggeration. Tom Engle was close
when he said, ‘‘The fact that David-
son will be accepting, on the average,
better qualified’ women than men...’’,
but he missed the mark when he
continued, “‘...raises the probability
that women will soon surpass the men
in academic achievement.”’ The truth,
which you printed and then passed
over, was given by H. Edmunds
White. ‘‘In a sense, we're operating
two separate admissions programs;
we're after not one total but two
separate totals. The college's criteria
for accepting men and women are
essentially the same, but the cut-off
levels are not.”

You have to admit that Dr. White
hit the nail on the head. With the
policy of accepting 1000 men and 300
women, we will have some men of
lower academic caliber than women,
but this in no way means that the

women will be more intelligent than
the men. The top 300 men will be at
least equal to the 300 women in
intelligence. The difference in intell-
igence would occur with the other 700
men. It is possible that we are
accepting some men who are less
capable than some women we turn
down. This really does not matter,
but that is another argument. What
does matter is that for every woman
on campus there is a man who can
match or surpass her in intelligence.
The only men who could be surpassed

by the women are the remaining 700

men.
I apologize for taking so long to
give my point, but maybe it will help
you te avoid plastering The David-
sonian with your feminist attitpde
Good luck in your future services as
Editor. ‘

band which has recently cut an
album, and appeared last October on
the ‘‘Dinah Shore Show”’.

Second, sponsoring this dance is by
no means an attempt to upstage the
concert with “‘Mother’s Finest’’. The
concert is on Friday night, and the
dance is Thursday. There is no reason
why students couldn’t attend both
events if they wanted to.

Third, the price of admission to the
dance is $1,.and it can be paid at the
door. This is not an attempt to
discourage anyone from attending the
dance, We are merely trying to cut
down on the costs of sponsoring the
dance. It costs a lot of money to put

-down the protective covering on the

floor of the gym, not to mention the
cost of having ‘‘Janice’’.

Fourth, there will be no drinking or
smoking allowed on the gym floor.
This is a school policy, and we have
agreed to abide by it. Students will be
allowed to drink in the lobby of the
gym, but no drinks will be served or
sold.

We hope this letter has answered
any questions students may have
about the dance, We also hope a lot of
students will attend.
