The Wrong Boat

_ AS FAR as we're concerned, Davidson’s Homecom-
ing is tomorrow. Almost a month has passed since that
day we saw the Wildcat ship go down — for the third
time, we thought. And so it was reported: Humiliating
Homecoming . . . Richmond 35, Davidson 6 .. . ’Cats
Won't Win Another Game. Tonight we'd like to alter that
report to say: Two Down And One To Go.

WHAT HAS happened at VPI and Lehigh will be
forever etched on many Davidson minds as the most |
significant landmark of their college years. And, know- |
ing the capacities of these minds, we can pay the ’Cats |
no se praise. ~

IT MUST be easy for the unbiased to tear apart two
upsets and list the causes 1-2-3. For us it’s one big mi-
racle, and not one of those freaks of nature that haunt |
the Bible Dept. |

School Spirit At Best

THE TEAM was away both times, once in the heart |
of Yankeeland. The college, deprived of a first-hand |
viewing, responded vigorously on the team’s return each |
time. And now, on the eve of a third outing in which
they are definite underdogs, the Wildcats are all keyed
up to play for the homefolk.

“THIS, THEN, is the Davidson we want,” said Coach:
Bill Dole in his weekly memo to the Wildcat Club. Well
put.

ON AT LEAST six occasions since the VPI upset,
the college and the students have overwhelmingly en-|
dorsed the Wildcats for anything they: might wish to be. |
Last night’s stimulating pep raliy was no exception.

One To Grow On

PRESIDENT MARTIN, surprised last Friday with a
combination 50th birthday party and Wildcat send-off,
said his present would be complete should Davidson de-
feat Lehigh. It shouldn't be repeated, but the Wildcats
have plans in the making for tomorrow to give Dr. Martin
one game to grow on.

DURING THE VPI-game film showing last week,
John Horton rose to make a proposal — that students
might like to remember the football team with something
“a little more tangible” than the cheers, which were noth-
ing short of astounding.

The more than 450 students gathered in the Morri-
son Room yelled their approval and shelled out coins

enough to plate with gold the Davidson-VPI game foot-}

ball.

WE'D LIKE to suggest something even more “tang-
ible.” Coach Dole says he needs six more football schol-
arships (or a total of 44) in order to bring his Wildcats
in line with other Southern Conference teams.
indicate your thoughts from the stands tomorrow after-
noon.
