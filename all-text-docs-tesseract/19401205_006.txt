STOP STEALING!

Several explanations might be made as to the cause of
this stealing. It may have grown up from the practice of
“coming back to pay later.” It may have come to pass
after several men saw that the store was so crowded and
so many men laid money on the cash register that there
was no adequate way of checking on just who had paid
their bill. But neither of these—or any other excuse—is
acceptable. If we are to be treated as gentlemen, then we
|| ‘must act as such!

This is no idle piece written about what might be tak-
ing place. Instead, it is written at the request of the man-
agers of the Student Store after they and several of the
clerks actually observed certain men failing to pay for
what they had eaten! Many of us will not believe that
this has been happening, but it is a fact!

When an editorial was written last year along the same
line it was stated, “Once the evil has been pointed out it
should end, in a student body of this type, under our honor
system.” It did stop last year, and should stop this time,
too.

The worst part of the whole matter is that it should
never start. Let’s stop it right now!
