To Confer With State College
Authorities On Athletic
Manifesto
Dr. Thomas W. Lingle, '93, left Mon-
day for a short visit to the University
of North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest,
and North Crrolina State College to
confer with the athletic authorities of
these institutions concerning the athletic
manifesto which is to be prepared for
the next annual North Carolina College

Conference meeting.

Dr. Lingle is the chairman of this
committee, having been elected last No-
vember by the North Carolina College
Committee, which is to prepare this ath-
letic manifesto. The committee is to set
forth wht should be the aim, purpose,
ideals and stafidards of athletic and phy-
sical education in general in the pro-
grams of Colleges and Universities, to-
ward which standard it is desired all
institutions should strive.

Other members who will be present
are Charles Mangum of the University
of North Carolina, and President Ben-
ford_of Guilford College.

Dr. Lingle spent the -latter part of
his vacation on a ten-day fishing trip
on the lakes and seas of Maine with his
son, Eustace,.'27, a young business man
of New York City.

On the 18th of September at the Ro-
tary Club at Salisbury, Dr. Lingle gave
a talk on the “Constitution of the United
States,” stressing mainly the personnel
of the convention and some problems
of the Constitution as they affect the
American people today,

September 17 was the 147th anniver-
sary of the signing of the Constitution
at Philadelphia and the Rotarians from
the Atlantic to the Pacific observed this
week as Constitutional week.

On September 25 Dr. Lingle geve the
same address before an open meeting
of the Woman's Club, of Shelby, to
which the professional men and_ the
teachers of the high school were also
invited.

Regulations Governing
Davidson Men Changed

There have been made evident at the
beginning of the current school year sev-
eral defid johanges in the regulations
governing the Davidson dormitories and
fraternities.

A copy of the revised dormitory rules
has been placed in each room, and a
bulletin explaining fraternity regulations
and revisions has been posted in. each
chapter.

Last spring the ban on radios was
lifted by the college authorities. At pres-
ent the control of radios is being en-
trusted to the integrity of the Student

Jody with the Student Council in
charge.
With the sanction of radios there

came a repeal of the regulation limiting
the number of electrical appliances to
three. ;

In the past year no light bulb ex-
ceeding sixty watts was permitted. As
the new student lamps, which were re-
cently installed by the college, require
a one hundred watt bulb, this regulation
has also been discarded.

In ;ddition to the installation of indi-
rect lighting the college has begun a
complete renovation of all
desks.

or not.

As to frateraity regulations, there has
been only one significant change. This
involves the shortening of the rushing
season from two weeks to one.

The other rules, including the prohibi-

“tion of hazing and dancing, Sabbath ob-

and initiation
will remain the same.

The editor also announced that a re-
turn engagement with the photographer
hes been mide for sometime about the
middle of October. All students are
urged, to have their pictures taken as
soon as possible, since this action on the
part of the student body will enable the
editors to secure the earlier publication
to which they are looking forward.

A system whereby students are able
to read more rapidly and improve their
