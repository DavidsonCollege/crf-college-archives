WELL, LITTLE GIRL

So you made it back again, little girl? And
you get to watch another dance weekend slide by,
through those big, bleary eyes sunk deeply into an

aching head.

Or maybe it’s your first time. Your date has
herded you and your bus-load of luggage up the
back stairs of Belk, told you all about how great we
are here, and given you a guided tour of such
scenic spots as his PO box or the place where Wood-
row Wilson spat out of the window of Eumenean
Hall. And now chances are:

1. You’re snowed out of your mind — if
you’re a high schoolie or a freshman or
from Queens, or...

2. You're sick of Davidson and your date—

if you’re a woman of the world, plus... .

3. You're wondering what the heck all this is
doing in a sport’s column.

Sometimes there's just nothing good about be-
ing a sport’s editor—like now for instance. Last
weekend was a disaster, to be cheerful about it.
And who wants to read or write about disasters,
that is, if they happened to you.

Maybe I should put a black border around this

age—the Little-led thinclads lost again, the fabu-
ious Foglemen were flattened and Homer Smith’s
Cinderella gridiron steamroller turned into a tem-
porary pumpkin. So at any rate I don’t write about
cross country, soccer or football. And that pretty
well kills the spectator sports.

But, I’m convinced that somewhere under all
the skirts and perfume and lacely little frills that
Homecoming brings, there’s some sport to be un-
covered.

You have to be pretty narrow-minded to limit
sports to spectator affairs. And whether you know
it or not, Date, it takes quite an athlete to put up
with you for a weekend.

He has to be a weight lifter to get you moved in
here, a track star to put up with all the running
around showing you things and a football expert
to explain to you why there are H-shaped poles
at each end of a lined-off field between two sets of
bleachers.

What could be more sporting than wrestling on
the lower soccer field or in the quiet of a parking
lot away from the blaring noise of a combo party?

No, these aren’t spectator sports, after all how
many spectators can you squeeze into a car? But
you'll probably never see a quarterback with
sneakier moves than a Davidson scholar-athlete,
or a boxer with faster hands than you, his date.

We have to practice for this weekend, you
know? It doesn’t just fall into place naturally. Lift-
ing footlockers, running laps around Chambers, por-
ing over football brochures, squeezing pillows, do-
ing tongue push-ups and muttering all sorts of ath-
letic sweet nothings as “sugar-dumpling,” “honey-
bunch” and “lambie-chop” in our little spare time,
like walking to the head.

At any rate, ol’ sport, you’re here, your first
Davidson weekend. Maybe if you play the game
as well as the girl who’s staying in the dorm with
you, you can make it down again, like she did. And
then like her, you can knowingly sit back and watch
another dance weekend slide by through bleary eyes
and an aching head.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

’Cats To Seek Comeback

PAGE FIVE

Over Underrated Keydets

By BOB REID
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Tomorrow afternoon
Coach Homer Smith sends
his ’Cats against one of the
toughest teams in the con-
ference, the Keydets of
VMI. The teams will take
the field at 2 p.m., before
a capacity Homecoming
crowd in Richardson sta-
dium.

Both teams desperately need
the victory. The Keydets are
winless after five games. Victory

; for the ‘Cats would compensate

for last week's humiliation at
the hands of William and Mary
and clinch the third place con-
ference slot. Added Coach Smith,
“If we can take VMI, Davidson
will become a Southern Confer-
ence powerhouse.”

Last year's contest saw the
Keydets wallop the ‘Cats 35-0.
VMI has trounced Davidson 26
times in 42 encounters. Davidson
has not beaten VMI since 19535.

The freshman footballers sus-
tained a 39-6 rout at the hands
of East Carolina's freshmen in
Newton Saturday night.

After a see-saw battle at mid-
field the Pirates broke through
for a score and led only 6-0 at
the half.

At the beginning of the second
half, East Carolina controlled
the ball for over six minutes be.
fore the defense held. The ‘Cats
were finally forced to kick from
their own 12, but the ball went
out of bounds on the 10. The
Pirates scored on their fourth
down.

The ‘Cats tried a pass after
the kick-off and an interception
went all the way to run the score
to 20-0. The rout was on then,
and nothing could stop it. The
‘Cats lone score came on Johnny
Slaughter’s 65 yard pass inter-
ception.

punting success.

Success is indeed the only
word for Caldwell’s kicking.
After averaging a respectable
39 yards a try in the first three
games, he provided one of
Davidson's few bright spots
against William and Mary Jast
week by averaging 46 yards per
kick.

Caldwell's style of punting has
been described as awkward due
to the fact that he drops the ball
from chest’ height instead of
from the waist. ‘‘I seem to get
better height on my kick with
a longer drop,”’ he exolained.
He went on to say that Coaches
Homer Smith and Ken Blair.
both of whom punted for their
college teams, have been work.
ing with him to get more height
on his kicks.

“My kick is natural.” he add-
ed, ‘‘and I'm not going to sac-
rifice height or distance just for
style.”

Caldwell, a former East Meck-
lenberg ace. has been punting
since he began his football ca-
reer in the eighth grade. After
playing halfback and _ tailback
in high school, he earned a slot
on the first defensive unit this
year.

Caldwell holds down the right
interceptor position and is pri-
marily responsible for the deep-
out zone on a pass. ‘Our basic
defenses allow the interceptor to
play his man more aggressively

picked off two of his opponents
passes so far this year. “The
key to our defense,” he added,
“is hustle and pursuit, When a
runner gets tackled, four or five

The ‘Cats presently share the
third place conference slot with
William and Mary. The home
team enters the game tomor-
row with a 3-1 record, having
blanked Presbyterian, Furman,
and the Citadel.

in seventh place lies winless
VMI. However, this comparison
is deceptive. The Keydets have

have to outhit them.”

Anchoring the Keydet line will

According to Coach Smith,
“This is a tough strong team,
Physically, they are stronger

final moments of the game.

The previously unbeat-
en Wildcats of Davidson
suffered their first defeat
Saturday afternoon at the
‘hands of William and
Mary.

Until that time the
"Cats had handled their
first three opponents with
relative ease, allowing
none of them to score.
However, disaster struck
in the form of a 41-7 de-
bacle.

When asked about the
game last Saturday,
Coach Homer Smith said,
“We don’t have a single
excuse.” Davidson got be-
hind early and, “We
pressed to try to catch
up and got into deeper
trouble. We could have
easily held the score down
~—I take the blame for
the high total — but we

men are in on it, not just one.”

A sophomore from Charlotte,
Caldwell intends to major in his-
tory. Although not absolutely
certain about his plans for the
future, he indicated that he will
probably attend seminary after
leaving Davidson.

Speaking of things past and
things to come, Caldwell said,
“William and Mary just played

a near perfect game. I don't
h think it hurt our spirit much — ly keep the score low, but

Foglemen Blanked By Duke

Blanked 6-0 by a powerful Duke soccer squad
Friday, Davidson’s booters bounced back Tuesday to
edge St Andrews 4-2. ;

Coach Harry Fogleman pointed out there were
many factors working against us in the Duke game.
“we had to leave four boys at home, two of them
starters. We ran into a couple of key injuries and
just didn’t get the breaks.” .

He added that for the first five minutes, the
’Cats controlled the ball, barely missing two or three
shots at the goal.

Juergen Schroder felt, “We were unlucky. The
field was short and small. They were taller and con-
trolled the head game. If we had scored at the start,
we could have won.”

The turning point in that game may have come
when Schroder, one of the ‘Cats’ chief offensive
threats, went up in the air for the ball and came
down in a hole (‘They dug it while he was up in the

air”), injuring his ankle. Later, Bobby Lanier was
kicked and suffered a painful injury to his hand.

__ Coach Fogleman felt that things could have been
quite different. “Duke played a fine game — they
didn’t make any mistakes — but things just didn’t
go well. I think we're as good as they are.”

The ’Cats did little to disprove their coach in
Tuesday's game. Although the score was close, 4-2,
the two St. Andrews goals came on penalty kicks in
the second half after Davidson had built a command-
ing lead. The game was marred with a number of
minor scuffles, two of which Jed to the questionable
penalty kicks.

Spirit remains high despite the loss. George
Brown predicted, ‘We're going to win the rest of
them.” Howard Morris, a 'Cat fullback, felt that
“all our mistakes were in that one game.” Glenn
Hanes summed up the team feeling, saying, “It was
a bad day, not to be repeated.”

maybe it helped. VMI has a good
team. They've come close to
beating some really good clubs,
but we'll be up for ‘em. ,

It appeared that the
’Cats weren’t the same
team as they had been in

services of quarterback Jake
Jacobsen to spark the ‘Cat of-
fense. Jacobsen has completed
ten out of 22 passes this season
for a total of 136 yards, and run
for another 107 yards. The ‘Cat

this season.

the first three games.
Said Coach Smith con-
cerning this point, “The
Significant differences
were that we played a
much better team than
before, and that our team
had not had any hitting
during the two-week lay-
off, due to not wanting to
-Tisk injury. The latter fac-
tor unquestionably made
a_ big difference. We
didn’t hit nearly as well
against William and Mary
as we did against the Cit-
adel.”

Coach Smith remarked
that the ’Cats had gone
back to hitting in prac-
tice and would continue
to do so. “There is no

other way to win than by
matching a team blow for
blow,” he said.

“We wish we could play
them again and make
amends, but we can't.
Fortunately, we play VMI,
a team much like William
and Mary, this week.”

This week’s IMAC flickerball action saw the Kappa Sigs still carrying the torch

19-9 with six minutes left in
the game when the ATO's got
a quick safety and a TD.

The E's started a drive to the
end zone but had ‘to give up pos-
session when a fourth down
bomb fell in the end zone out
of the reach of the intended re-
ceiver.

The Betas dropped the Pl
Kapps into the league cellar
when they frouneed them 47-13.
Frank Bass found the way to
paydirt clear four times in lead-
ing the winner's attack.

The Tau's managed to get
possession of the ball with ‘forty
seconds left but couldn‘t pro-
duce a score. “With a Httle
bit of luck, we could have
won,” lamented Geoff Birkhead
for the ATO cause.
