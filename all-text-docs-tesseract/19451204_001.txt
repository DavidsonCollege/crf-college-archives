On Atomic Age

Dr. Bart J.
sor of astronomy at Harvard Uni-
versity and a native of the Nether-
lands, spoke to the student body on
November 23. He urged that all men
learn to think beyond the narrow
limits of their field
We cannot, he stated, go into our
ivory towers and escape the world.
for in this time the world demands
of all men that they think about

explosive power of those used in
World War I, whereas the bomb
develops 10 milliom times the ex-
plosive power of any explosive yet
produced. Second: Future atomic
bombs can be built by any nation
wishing to try the experiment for a
fraction of the amount spent by the
United States in perfecting the first
bomb. Third:°The atomic bomb is
not a secret. Any good scientists
with several million dollars and good
assistants can, by studying the avail-
able freports, produce an atomic
bomb in a short while. Fourth: lf
we insist on keeping the bomb to
