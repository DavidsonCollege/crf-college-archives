Last week two distinguished poets visited
Davidson. Alice Fulton,
a professor at the Uni-

theme. English Professor Alan Michael Parker
organized the event, and posed questions to the
poets in front of a full Perkins Auditorium. Bidart
and Fulton were asked to define their work in
relation to body and spirit, as well as speak to
receptions of the
reader.

once the body stops accelerating.
It's astonishing how nothingness
firms up. Air takes on mass.

The transparent turns substantial.

construction of a
poem, which accord-
ing to Bidart, is itselfa
creation of a body.
During the discussion,
Fulton and Bidart
talked about their own
poetry and each other’s
work. In addition to

four volumes of poetry.
Both poets visited with students in several En-
glish classes to discuss the art of poetry.

In addition to class visits, Fulton and Bidart
participated in a symposium entitled “Construct-
ing the Body in Contemporary Poetics” for this
year’s English Senior Colloquium. The topic for
this fall’s Colloquium is Reading the Body, and
the poets responded to questions regarding this

meetings with stu-
dents, each poet gave
a reading in the 900 Room. Fulton read to an
audience last’ Monday, and Bidart followed on
Tuesday evening.

The campus greeted the poets with open
arms, and many people attended each event. The
Davidson Community is fortunate to have had the
opportunity to talk with two renowned poets,
Alice Fulton and Frank Bidart.

Three professors discuss
faith in the classroom

By JorDON STEELE
Guest Writer

On Monday, November 15", students, fac-
ulty, and members of the Davidson community
gathered to hear three Davidson College profes-
sors lecture on how faith plays a part in their
teaching. Their respective areas of study proved to
encompass a variety of disciplines; Dr. Foley from
the Religion department, Dr. Yukich from Phys-
ics, and Dr. Levering from History.

The attendees, packed into Phi Hall, first

. heard Dr. Foley speak on the role of religion in his

life and work. He began by clarifying “what [his]
faith is and what [his] faith is not.” While Dr.
Foley encourages sharing the Christian doctrine
with nonchristians, he does not believe in convert-
ing those who are not Christian. In his words,
forced conversion destroys “the otherness of the
other.” In the classroom, Dr. Foley emphasizes
that truth and beauty are not exclusive to one
group, and that there are other nonchristian view-
points that reveal truth in life. Dr. Foley also
challenges his students to be “honest” with them-
