LEAN_YEARS AHEAD?

Subsidization Hopes Dim --Scott

By STEVE WILLIAMS
Sports Writer
(Last In A Series)

Now that the spring sports
are in full swing, Davidson
athletes are participating in
rugby. baseball, tennis, golf
and track, all under the la-
bel of ‘intercollegiate minor
sports."”

In the past four articles of
this series we have tried to
analyze the problems, suc-
cesses and shortcomings of
the spring sports and several
of the sports labeled ‘mi-
nor”.

With Dr. Tom Scott. Direc-
tor of Athletics and Physical
Education. lies the task of
coordinating the programs of
both major and minor sports.
plus the job of coaching the
golf team.

Under his direction. the
golf team has brought home
the past three Southern Con-
ference golf. championships.
So far this season, however,
the golf team hasn't been up
to par.

Scott noted that the ouf-
come of the golf season will
be determined in the final
tournament at the end of the
season, and that Davidson's
chances are stil! very good
for continuing their title dom-
ination.

The main problem con.
fronting the golf team. ac-
cording to Scott. is replacing
the players who have gradu.
ated in the past. He also re-
iterated another problem. the
one that has been empha-
sized by the coaches of the
other minor sports, ‘‘non-
subsidization.”

The list of schools subsidiz-
ing golf in the Southern Con-
ference is a growing one.
George Washington, Furman
and East Carolina Universi-
ty all have scholarships to
offer. “It’s not a lack of in-
terest that hurts golf. but
Competing with subsidized
teams,”’ Scott said.

Scott. talking about spring
Sports in general, turned to
some of the brighter points
concerning the matter of mi-
hor sports. He noted that at
least 40 per cent of the stu-
dent body participates in ath-
letics.

“Not everyone can play
basketball or football, so the
minor sports are most vatu-
able as a carry-over for the
students. The spring sports
give more students a chance
to participate on the intercoi-
legiate level,’’ he noted.

Soccer, wrestling, track.
swimming, golf and baseball
eliminate the ‘‘size problem"
in intercollegiate sports that

keeps many good athletes
from participating in the ma-
jor sports. Dr.” Scott added
that ‘‘the minor sports broad-
en the areas of participation’’
for students.

The biggest handicap stil!
remaining is that the minor
sports are _ non-subsidized.
“Despite this definite dis-
advantage we still hold up.”
continued Dr. Scott.

Swimming, baseball and
track aro hurt the worst, ac-
cording to Scott, by non-sub-
sidization. ‘You need good
pitchers in baseball to buitd
@ team. They are usually of-
fered athletic scholarships by
other colleges and go »'lse-
where."

Soccer doesn’t really feel
the pains of non-subsidization
since there are still several
schools that don’t subsidize
their soccer teams.

As for track. Scott agreed
with Coach Heath Whittle
that it would be unfair to
give scholarships to just a
few athletes: ‘You couldn't
give a few scholarships in
track because you would end
up having to give a lot of
them to be really fair."" said
the athletic director.

As far as tennis and golf
are concerned, Scott noted
that they have managed to

win several conference

championships despite play-
ing subsidized teams.

Scott also discussed the
problem of facilities, noting
that “all of them could be
improved. We could certain-
ly use a new golf course,” he
said, sighting this as one ol
the disadvantages to the golf
team.

When asked about the lack
of publicity for the minor
sports, Scott replied that ‘‘we
can't force a newspaper to
put article in. If we get them
the material and they don’t
run it, there's nothing we
can do about it.”

According to Scott, the pos-
sibilities of subsidizing these
sports in the future are dim.
“We have a difticult time
getting enough for just bas-
ketball and football as it is,’’
he added.

From the standpoint of the
previous articles in this se-
ries, it is apparent that non-
subsidization is a bigger
problem than many alumni.
faculty members and _stu-

dents realize.

The stronger teams of Da-
vidson's non-subsidized units,
golf, tennis and track, are
apparently facing dismal
seasons as the result of com-
peting with the continually
growing list of subsidized
teams.

Whether or not substdiza-
tion would improve minor in-
tercollegiate sports at David-
son is questionable, but it
would put them on the same
basis as other teams in the
Southern Conference.

Maybe wrestling coach
Charles Parker is right in
saying there are no minor
sports at Davidson. only non-
subsidized ones.

The fact remains that sub-
sidized basketball and foot-
ball wilt continue to reign at
Davidson in publicity and
prestige. The other sports
that exist without subsidiza-
tion will remain ‘‘the other
sports.”

Catfish Place Third In Tourney
As Sailing Season Nears Finish

By ALEX GORDON
Sports Writer

After its first full year as a
varsity sport, the Davidson
sailing team is nearing the
end of its season.

The ‘Catfish’ have partici-
pated in intercollegiate com-
petition since 1965 but not on
a varsity basis. In March of

last year, however, it was
decided that sailing should
be added to the list of var-
sity sports.

Tlie team has since become
a member of the South At-
lantic Intercollegiate Sailing
Association (SAISA). which
includes The Citadel, the Col-
‘ege of Charleston, South Car-
olina. Clemson, Duke, Old
Dominion, Virginia, and Wil-
liam and Mary. There are
other such associations
throughout the United States.

Dr. Hallam Walker, a pro-
fessor in the French Depart-
ment, sponsors the team.
John Moore is captain of the
team, and Jim Lee, another
member of the team, has
served this year as president
of SAISA.

Although the team has
around twenty members,
Walker pointed to senior

Organized practice is held
‘on Wednesday and Friday af-

bers try to get out to prac-
tice as often as_ possible.
Throughout the year Walker
has tried to get as many
boys as possible into the
meets.

According to both Walker
and Lee, the most important
factor in sailing ability is ex-
perience. Lee added tht
along with this experience
must go a great deal of pa-
tience, especially in lake sail-
ing, since the wind is always
shifting. He also commented
that it is often very difficult
to pace yourself to avoid
panicking and hurting your
chances in the race.

The sailing team has the
longest competitive season
of any sport at Davidson. In
fact, it actually has two sea-
sons. The first one lasts
through the fall up until De-
cember, while the second
season begins in late Feb-
ruary and runs officially
through late June. This year.
though, the Wildcats will
probably stop competition as
soon as the present term
ends.

sors an invitational regatta

vited, and each year one of

ed as the “Spring Sailing

skipper and the crew. The A
and B teams race as many
times as there are teams
present, so that each boat in
the regatta is used by each
team.

The race usually follows a
one mile, triangular course.
The first side of the triangle
(referred to as the weather
leg). is upwind. This initial
leg serves to spread out the
fleet and provides possibly
the greatest test of skill dur-
ing the race. The next leg is
across the wind, at which
time each boat usually main-
tains the same position rela-
tive to the others. The final
leg is downwind.

The races are scored un-
der a low point system, with
three-fourths of a point
awarded for first, two for
second, three for third, and

This year the Catfish have
generally finished third in

highlight of the season came

the same squad that won a
narrow victory in eleventh
annual Davidson Relays last
Saturday.

Western Carolina's Cata-
mounts edged Pembroke
State by one-half point. while
Davidson followed Cumber-
land for fourth place. It
marked only the third time
in the history of the Relays
that Whittle’s Wildcats have
not claimed their own title.

Davidson won the 440 yard
relay and the shuttle hurdle
relay, while taking second
in the mile and 880 yard fe-
lays.

Tom Rogers took third in
the long jump and fifth in the
triple jump.

Despite the kindred feel-
ing that must exist between
two sets of Whittlemen, re-
venge will be on the minds
of Davidson's Cats.

Not only did Whittlé see his
son's team sweep past David-
son in the Relays last week.
but Tuesday he saw Kim
Piersol sweep past Whittle’s
own track record i in a triangu-
lar meet with Furman and
High Point.

‘Piersol broke the record
for individual points in a sin-
gle meet on the Davidson
track, set by Whittle in 1920.

Furman, paced by Piersol.,
won the meet with a total of
93 points to Davidson's 53
and High Point's 33.

The only first place for Da-
vidson was in the shot put
where sophomore Steve Kir-
ley took the honors. Kirley
also finished second in the
discus.

Doug Hill won a second in
the pole vault for the team's

first points in that event this |

season. Hill has started prac-
ticing with the team in re-
cent weeks and his progress
has been called ‘‘very en-
couraging’’ by Whittle.

The Relays Saturday were
plagued throughout by rain
showers, hindering both the
individual and team efforts
and cutting down on the at-
tendance. Less than 100 stu-
dents, according to an unof-
ficial estimate, turned out for
the event.

Because of the rain and the
resulting slow track condi-
tions, no meet records were
set. Appalachian’s Clayton
Deskins was the only double
winner in the event, taking
the long jump and the triple
jump.

The meet came down to
the last two contestants in
the last event, the pole valut.
Western Carolina’s Tommy
Jordan leaped 13-6 to edge
favorite Harold Lilly of Pem-
broke to give the Catamounts
their half-point decision.

West Georgia finished a
distant fifth behind David-
son, followed by Appalachian,
High Point, Catawba, Carson-
Newman, Mars Hill, Presby-
terian, and Elon. Atlantic
Christian, Emory, Berry, and
WNC-C failed to score.

Following the  tri-meet
Monday, the Whittlemen have
just two meets left, the North
Carolina State Meet for all
state colleges and the South-
ern Conference Meet. The
state meet will be held ia
Durham during Mid-winters
week-end, while the confer-
ence meet will be held in Fort
Eustis. Va. the following
week-end.

Although Davidson has no
real chance of taking the con-
ference or state meets be-
cause of the heavily subsidiz-

ed com petition. Whittle feels
that the Wildcats will make
a good showing. ‘‘We're im-
proving as the season goes
along. The young members
of the team are beginning to
get used to college competi-
tion and the meet conditions.
If everyone does his job, we'll
do all right."

Furman’s Piersol
Sinks Davidson

ed to be a one-man wrecking

attraction, or whatever one
chooses to call him after see-
ing the fentastic trackman
in action.

Plersol, in a tri-meet with
Davidson and High Point
Tuesday, racked up a total
of 263% points, enough in one
meet for a Davidson cinder-
man fo earn his letter for a
season, while leading his Pal-
adin team to a sweep of the
meet.

Plersol took firs! places in
the 100-yard dash, the 220-
yard dash, the triple jump,
the tong jump and the high
jump, while anchoring @ leg
of Furman’s winning 440-
yard relay.

Such feats aren't new to
Plerso!, though, as the re-
cently-named All-American
trackster has won very often.
in fect, he recently finished
fifth In the triple jump in an
NCAA meet at the beginning
of the spring track season.

And thet was before he
hed had tlme to practice.

Plersol never donned a pair
of track spikes or participat-
ed in a single meet in high
school.
