Wildcat's Success Could Hinge On Freshmen

By BRUCE BALESTIER

Last year’s4-24 campaign was
a frustrating one for the Wildcats
and first-year coach Bob McKil-
lop; a hellish early-season sched-
ule (losses to St. John’s, Duke,
Virginia and Wake Forest) buried

This year’s squad -has-a radi-
cally differentcomplexion, though,
and if McKillop can find consis-
tentoutside shooting and a reliable
point guard from among _ his
charges, a winning season and a

Ini conference finish are surely
ithin reach.

The point guard spot is, at the
moment, up for grabs. Six players,
seniors Darry Strickland and
Turner Gilmore, juniors Sterling
Freeman and Paul Denmond, and
freshmen Pat Holloway and Jason
Zimmerman, are in the midst of a
five week period which ought to
determine a successor, or succes-
sors, tothe graduated Allan Hunter.

Denmond seems the most
likely candidate for the spot; he
started nearly every game last year
at off guard.

But everyone has a chance,
andcoach Bob McKillop hasmade
clear that he has “‘no qualms what-
soever about starting a freshman,”
provided he can “make the adjust-
ment to college basketball” as a
student and as an athlete. Don’t be
surprised to see either Holloway or
Zimmerman starting at the point.

The forward positions are

Big South

By BRUCE BALESTIER

Great news came for the Big
South Conference this summer
when the NCAA announced that,
effective this season, the Big South
tournamentchampion will face the
winner of the Southwestern Ath-
letic Conference for the privilege
of a spot in the 64-team NCAA
tournament.

The heavy favorite to be play-
ing in that game is Coastal Caro-
lina. Davidson, along with
Campbell, UNC-Asheville and
Winthrop, all have a chance to
dethrone Coastal, while Baptist,

Augusta and Radford seem less _

likely to do so. e

Coastal Carolina

There’s no mistaking it; every

other team in the Big South is
-chasing Coastal Carolina. Four
double figure scorers, among them
three all-league performers, return
from last year’s team that ran
roughshod through the conference

_ schedule with an 11-1 record. 6’8"
forward Tony Dunkin (19.1 ppg,

6.6 rpg) leads the parade; he was |

named Big South Player of the

year last season as freshman. Guard —

Robert Dowdell (15.3 ppg, 6.9 apg)
and 6°10" DuWayne Cheatam
(13, 6 ppg, 7.2 tpg) joined him on
the all-conference team. The Chan-
ticleers seem an obvious choice to

similarly vacant due to the depar-
ture of Jay Schmitt and Mo Gray.

Presently, 6’7" sophomore J.D...

Heuer seems to have an edge over
junior Paul Drobnitch and junior
college transfer Jeff Chapin at the
big forward slot. Swingmen Janko
Narat and Scott Alford and for-
wards Ron Horton and James
Marsh- ought-to- compete forthe
small forward role.

The center and off guard posi-
tions seem rock solid, with 6’11"
sophomore Detlef Musch and 6’3"
junior Paul Denmond ready to
reprise their starting roles ofa year
ago. Musch averaged 9.9 points
and 6.7 rebounds last year, and
bulked up a much-needed twenty
pounds over the summer with a
difficult weight program. McKil-
lop feels that he has “[taken] him-
self from one level toanother level”
since the end of last season.

Denmond has, apparently,
answered all challenges in the first
two weeks of practice, and seems
prepared to improve upon his team-
high 13.4 points per game of a year
ago.

Says McKillop, “His defense
has been superb, his shot selection
has improved, [and] his shooting
consistency has become better...
he is making his statement about
where he is going to fit into our
plans.”

The large question mark with
this year’s team pertains to outside
shooting. Last season’s squad shot
42.6% from the field, and shooting

guard Paul Denmond’s. shot be-
came less reliable as the season
progressed. .

Said McKillop, “I don’t be-
lieve we had enough threats other
than P.D. from the outside.” The
ability of defenses to concentrate

on Denmond diminished his effec-
tiveness. The freshman class will
be relied on to take some of the
pressure off Denmond. McKillop
confided that the “primary focus
of our recruiting was to bring in
people who could score and could

shoot.” Zimmerman, Holloway and
fellow freshmen Janko Narat and
Scott Alford all fill that bill.

After two trying years as an
independent, conference affiliation
means a great deal to the program;
the possibility of aconference title
and a possible NCAA tournament
berth isan exciting one. Withclose
games last season against Winthrop
and UNC-Asheville, McKillop
believes that the team has already
made a “statement that we are
competitive with the Big South”,
and his sights are set high; “we
coach and play to win champion-
ships,” he said.

So things are coming together
at last; McKillop took care of his
greatest liabilities, perimeter shoot-
ing and ballhandling, by bringing
in a deep and talented recruiting
class.

Recruiting expert Bob Gibbons
lavished praise upon that class,
calling it “the strongest we’ ve seen
at Davidson in some time, and a
well-rounded group that will help
in every area. In the Big South,
they have easily the best recruiting
class.”

But McKillop acknowledges
that the freshmen will “be put in
the fire immediately.” The success
of this year’s team just might de-
pend on how smoothly those new-
comers are able to make the transi-
tion from high school to college
basketball.

Prediction: 15-12, 9-5 in Big
South (2nd place)

Conference Chases Coastal Carolina

repeat.
Campbell

The Camels handed Coastal
Carolina their only league defeat
last season, and tied for second
with a 7-5 mark. Guards Mark
Mocnik (13.4 ppg) and Rod Gour-
dine (10.3 ppg) will bear the brunt
of the scoring load; 6’9" Marvin
Edmonds and 6’5" Reggie Smith
should handle the rebounding and
shot-blocking chore

task ofreplacing his leading scorer
and top assist man. Lucky for him,
acouple of talented players remain
athis disposal; juriior guard George
Henson (15.8 ppg) proved himself
a reliable scorer last season, and
should receive assistance from 6’5"
Andy McKoy and 676" Mark
Hailey.

~ UNC-Asheville

The Bulldogs tied Campbell
for second in the Big South with a
7-5 record last year, but have been
ravaged by graduation. Their press-
ing need is to fill the void left by
the departures of leading scorer
Milton Moore and point guard
Maurice Caldwell. Guard Darryl
Sanders (11.0 ppg) and 6’9" Brent
Keck will be relied on to pick up

the slack.

Augusta

The Jaguars return a host of
young talent; marked improvement
upon last year’s 4-8 conference
record seems unavoidable. Lead-
ing scorer Brian Schmall (15.0,4.7
apg) returns for his junior cam-
paign; junior Keenan Mann (14.9
ppg, 7.4rpg).and sophomore Derek
Stewart (14.9 ppg, 6.5 ppg, 2.9
bpg) promise to enforce the paint
with authority.

Radford

After apretty dismal campaign

a year ago (3-9, 7-22), including a
1-12 mark on the road, coach Ol-
iver Purnell’s Highlanders seem
ready for only negligible improve-
ment. Seniorcenter Ron Shelburne
(11.9 ppg) will man the middle and
sophomore guard Doug Day (11.6
ppg) has promise, but there is little
else.

Baptist
The loss to graduation of Dar-

tyl Hall (18.2 ppg, 8.5 rpg), last
year’s conference scoring and
rebounding champion, and forward
Luther Tutt (13.9 ppg, 8.0 rpg)
looks to be insurmountable for the
Buccaneers. Guard David Oliver
(14.8 ppg) ought to help, but Bap-
tist seems destined to hold down
last place in the conference. |
