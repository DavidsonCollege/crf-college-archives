FRED EHLERS “ND JOSE BORRAJERO

Discuss Plans For PRAM

Foreign Student Forms
Inter - American Group

Fred Ehlers, Richardson Scholar trom Ecuador, is not unaccustomed to public at-
tention. At home, he iniated a youth cultural organization (“The Voice of Youth”)
that quickly gained public attenton through a newspaper column, a radio and a tele-

vision show.

On arriving at Davidson,
Ehlers was struck with the
possibilities of an international
cultural exchange within the
Americas. Not being one to keep
such ideas to himself, he launch-
ed his latest yenture—Project
of the Americas (PRAM).

PRAM is designed to become
a permanent cultural exchange

program, organized around
Davidson College and ‘The
Voice of Youth.”’ Initially it is
hoped that 10-12 Piedmont
scholars can travel to Ecuador
next summer, live there about
six weeks, and speak with civic
and cultural groups about
American patterns of life and
thought.

“In 1966 and °67,"" Ehlers ven-
tured, “‘We hope to carry on a
dual exchange with students
from both Ecuador and the
United States participating. In
1968 we would like to spread
into Columbia and Peru and
eventually make this a pro-
ject of all the Americas.”

He continued, ‘““Young people
have a force to create—as well
as to destroy. In this organiza-
tion. we are-trying to show that
this creativity can be imple-
mented. We take this college
as the beginning and as our
center.” ,

Tryouts Open To
Select Players In
Coming Drama

The Davidson College Drama
Department will hold tryouts for
Anouilh’s Thieve's Carnival
Wednesday and Thursday nights
jin. Hodson Hall beginning at
7:30. All members of the David-
son community are invited to
tryout.

The cast calls for 10 men
and four women all with a flare
for Comedy.

Among the men’s roles are:
three blundering thieves — the
leader and his two young ap-
prentices, alt of whom romp
through the play with nume-
rous disguises; a rich country
bumpkin and his father; a
stately, befuddled English lord;
and a group of wacky police-
men.

The major women’s roles con-
sist of the elderly Lady Hurf,
a charming but bored English
noblewoman who sees the mas-
querade as a diverting game,
and her two lovely young nieces
who are looking for romance.

Copies of the script are on
overnight reserve in the Col-
lege Library or may be obtain-
ed by contacting the Drama
Office.

Ehlers will follow his David-
ton assembly address with a
similar talk at Queens on De-
ecember 16. His organization has
gained the attention of area
newspapers, civic ofganizations

and educators—all of whom are ..

bidding for his time.

Fred Ehlers has just been
named the Davidson Repre-
sentative to a Student Coun-
cli Conference being held at
Texas A & M, December
9-12. The topic will be “Chal-
lenges To The Americas. Pan
American Friends: Promise
or Threat.”

The Davidson PRAM chapter
riow has 32 members ‘and has
already branched out to include
a group at Queens. Other .Pied-
mont schools have indicated a
desire to participate.

What does Ehlers hope to ac-
complish? *. .. In order to be
friends, we (US and _ Latin
America) have to start by know-
ing each other. Latins must
know that there is culture in the

United States, that you have a
religion, that you are creating
a great society. And that the
real people. its young genera
tion, like you here at Davidson.
are willing to be friendly.”

As many are finding, Ehlers
is not to be taken lightly. He
believes in the purposes and in
the feasibility of his organiza-
tion. The close of his recent as-
sembly address gave voice to
this conviction.

“Finally, I would like. to say
to all of you that I, like the
rest of the members of PRAM.
am going to fight until our
ideals become a_ reality. be-
eause we think that the time
has ‘come in Latin America and
in the U. S. for somebody to
say the truth and for somebody.
to accept.”

Next Wedhesday night Ehlers
will conduct a meeting of ‘the
local PRAM chapter and he
has invited all who are interest-
ed in the organization's ideals
to attend. The time and location
of the meeting will be announc:
ed. early next week.

Attends

Library Conference

Miss Carrie L. Brittain, David-
son Circulation librarian, at-
tended a conference in Septem-
ber at the Institution of Govern-
ment at Chapel Hill on publica-
tions at the city and state level.
The conference dealt with the
value and availability of such
documents as financial, health,
and crime reports and plans for
future city or state develop-
ment.

Although subscribing to
a large numoer of such publica.
tions would be impossible, Miss
Brittain said that. the library
is now able to obtain any such
material upon student request.

A similar conference will be
held at Chapel Hill next fall
on publications of the United
Nations.

The Green Sheet, a monthly
evaluation of current movies,
is now being posted in the lobby
of the library. Miss Brittain
commented that a number of
students and residents of David-
son have called the library
asking for ratings on movies
and that The Green Sheet. a
publication of the Motion Pic-
ture Association of America. is
“tops” in this field.

She added that “it is one of
the most broad-minded publica-
tions of its type. for it- gives
a true rating of each movie.”
As well as indicating for which
age groups the films. are suit-
able the sheet tells which of
them were adapted from books
or plays.

The new Ducostat machine

in ‘the library. 1s able to repro.
duce any written material for
student use. Miss Brittain com-
mented thal the Ibirary ‘had a
similar machine on a_ trial
basis last. year and that the
currefit one is made possible
by a school subsidy.
The machine reproduces -ma.
terial on a reduced scale since
it is egal to make an exact
copy.

‘The Island’ Presents
Image Of Japanese Life

By CHARLES VICK
a review

It is a poem. That is the best
way to describe the latest Union
film. The Island is a Japanese
production with aa impact of
much broadet base. The plot
is life unstructured, the tech-
nique entirely visual and the
beauty intense. On an island
off Japan a family lives its
life. Water is the essential item
of their existance, Each day
begins with a trip to the main-
land tor water. four buckets
in an ancient boat. The rhythm
of the oar, the wave, the move-.
ment to and from the land and
the life of these people are one.
The eldest son goes to school,
and he must be taken each day
and returned each night. The
mother strokes the boat in and
gets the child and more precious
water. The island rises straight
from the sea and the water
must be carried to the fields
which cover every available
foot of land. The mother stumb-
les, the water is Jost and the
father slaps her. She gets up
and works.

This film is not to be describ-
ed. These words mean nothing
without the image. A world of
subsistence and function is the
island. Everyone moves his or-
dered way. These are peasants.
They do not wonder at them-
selves or their lot. In small
things they find laughter. The
boys catch a fish and on a trip
to sell it the family looks at

the city, eats and goes home to
water trips and plants and
more work. The watering of the
piants ‘is the guide to the visual
image. The water is poured
gently above the plant, just
so much. The soil takes it and
it is gone. And so another trip
and more water. This is the
rythmn.

The eldest son sickens and
dies: The rhythm continues
The priest comes with the
child’s classmates and the soil
takes him and he is gone. Grief
strieken, both the parents un-
derstand. They say nothing,
Their faces are so closed. You
feel so at the first. and yet in
glances you begin to see more
than words. So the trips con-

tinue. Again at the top of the
island the wife, so strong .be-
fore, becomes wholly woman
and turns over her bucket and
weeps. The husband watches,
waits and then turns to his
plants, gently pours the water
above them. The soil takes it
and it is gone, the only answer.

The photography is excellent.
The film is excellent. It is un-
fortunate so few people attend
these presentations. The Film

Friends will present Bed and
Sofa, a silent Russian film. Sid
Farrar will give piano accom-
paniment to this classic. Try

to see this one. These films are
valid pieces of art and worth
the time and the thought.

Miss Brittain added that the
Ducostat is especially helpful
in reproducing material from
books which do not circulate
from the library and in copying
illustrations.

World Travel Reactions

By WAYNE MIXON
Davidson Student in Germany

Ammediately after crossing
the border and .Jeaving France.
a country that continues 10 do
little but squeeze the last. drop
out of life itself which is mark-
ed by a religiously observed
two hour lunch break, West
Germany appears as a section
of the industrial area of the
United States set down in cen-
‘tral Europe. Nowhere else in
Europe are superb express-
ways filled so dangerously be-
yond capacity with traffic. car-
rying cargo and people all over
such a rich country. Every-
thing across the country ap
pears neatly and systematical-
ly. arranged, which hints toward
the terrific German mentality
of only doing exactly what you
are told to do. When crossing
a street the Germans do not
move until the light so indicates:
even when there is no traffic.
they continue io stand and
watch the light, waiting only.
to be lead across. If a foreig-
fie starts across when there
is no traffic, the Germans will
jump right in line’ and walk
across’ also. The overwhelm-
ing opinion of most Europeans
is that German mentality pos
sesses no imagination or self-
direction, and can be easily
Jead and influenced in any way,
which .resulfs in a nation of
pedantic, non-questioning fol
lowers.

In contrast one can observe
that in the cities of France
most streets are one way, a
safety precaution largely be-
cause the French people will
not stay on their own side of
the road, and the other roads
are without lines because it
would have litile effect on these
people who daily practice: the
policy ‘‘use a rule to your own
benefit'—if it is too much
trouble. quote a rule and do
nothing; however, if in real
need, quote a rule which per-
mits side-stepping - around the
first rule. The French are the
individuals and do the unex-
pected; the Germans are fol-
lowers and do the expected.
The majority of Europeans are
frightened by the German men-

The Male Chorus and Wind

only what you’ve been’ told to
do, The southern Europeans
blast the mechanical. - minded
Germans with “‘you are missing
life itself and all it has. to of
fer.” and ‘‘éultaral achieve-
ments -are more important. than
highways and factories.” The
standard. of living in West Ger-
many continues to rise above
the rest of Europe, and southern
Europeans, with or without
their supposed cultural achieve-
ments. struggle to find some
Way ‘to improve their economy
so they too might enjoy a high-
er standard of living.

East’ Germany presents a
most unusual situation. To many
it represents the biggest blund-
er that America has participat-
ed in since the war. Equipped
with legal and = inter-national
machinery for the joint manage-
ment of all Germany, BUT by
lack of communication, negli-
gence, and almost pure laxity
in responsibility, the Western
sphere of direct influence is
now cut off by many. miles of
barbed ‘wire down the middle
of Germany: In Berlin there
is the Wall. “How Jeng has it
been like this? Why doesn’t
someone do something about
it?"’ American tourists murmur
and disgustedly shake their
heads when a guide points out
a cross erected to indicate
where a 57 year old lady jump-
ed to freedom, but died doing
it,

Undoubtedly the largest pro-
paganda gimmick that anyone
will ever uncover in all of East-
ern Europe is committed by the
West. It is the contrast of de-
scriptions of a modern. well-
made and throbbing ‘Free Ber-
lin" with the dark; World War

sections of West Berlin. There
are many new apartment build-
ings, wide streets are lined
with consumér goods ‘stores,
young children have bicycles.
boys have good looking girl
friends, and fathers push baby
carriages as mothers walk
‘alongside; yet there remain
signs which become more subtle
everyday that these people are
not really free to say and do
as they want. The majority of
young students feel it is to their
advantage to take Russian, not
English (all young students in
West Germany study English
at age 9); an artificial exchange
tate accents the situation that
things are not as the people
would have them. but rather
controlled (the arbitrary setting
of one East German mark equal
to one West German mark, a
300 percent increase in market
value); Soviet flags fly on street
corners alongside those of East
Germany: numero.s soldiers
are on the streets and a rumor
is overheard that someone just
escaped into Free .Berlin.

Male Chorus In
Need Of Funds

The Male Chorus presently
needs an additional $2.000 in
order to finance its European
concert tour for next summer.

According to Prof. Donald
B. Ploti, director of the chorus,
approximately $21,000 has been
raised among the chorus mem-
bers and from private dona-
tions. However, the magic
number .that has to be reached
is $23,000.

Plott commented on _ this
shortage by saving. ‘‘Since we're
only. $2.000. away from our goal.
it is almost definite that we are
going. But until all the money
comes in, our plans have. to
remain at the tentative stage.”

In an effort to raise more
funds for their.-trip, the mem-
bers sponsored the recent var-
sity-freshman basketball game.
Having been originally planned
by William C. Bondurant, di-
rector of alumni relations, this
event netted a profit of slight-
ly over $400, as well as some
valuable publicity in many area
newspapers.

Bondurant has been in charge
of the financial details of the
project.. Besides working to pub-
licize the trip and gain dona-
tions, he has also been trying
to arrange transportation for
the ‘chorus. However, all such
plans._xregarding transportation:
and .ititierary cannot. be con-

| firmed until a later time after.
| the finances have been assured.

Any student interested <n ac-
companying the chorus and any
person who would like to con-
tribute to the trip fund are en-
couraged to contact Bondurant.
