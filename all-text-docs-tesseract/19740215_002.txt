A recent case puimts up the
essemtia. role that students
must play in security affairs
A call from Belk dorm clin-

ched the capture of three per-
sons from Smithville and one
from Cabarrus County who
were making off with an
estimated $200.00 worth of
records. About a dozen of the
records were recovered, and
the bandits have been charged
with second degree burglary.

Dean of Students Will Terry
1s pleased with the new
security system. However, he
commented that an earlier
call from the students in Belk
dorm may have resulted in a
lesser charge for the offenders
in the previously mentioned
case The maximum punish-
ment for second degree
burglary in North Carolina is
hfe imprisonment

In spite of the intensified
security. some small offenses
have occurred A couple of
signs were taken from
business establishments in
town. but these were later
returned. Also. during Mid-
winters weekend the new sign

$1 822.463 in cash has thusfar
been donated to Davidson.
This ss a % percent increase
over the $1.343. 248 raised for
the same seven months last
year

Notably. the total cash
raised for the entire fiscal
year 1970-71 was $1,136,000.

The first seven fiscal mon-
ths ending January 31, 1974
shows the Annual Fund at
$124,617. as compared with
$117,000. last year. This in-
crease is a big percent jump.

As of Jan. 31, there was a $1000
increase, to $132,000, over last
year. Winston called this in-

Last fiscal year a total of
$2.294.000 was raised. This
figure was a seventy percent

Winston said that he was
hopeful that this total could be
surpassed but would not

“The main reason for his
coming to Davidson in the first
place was to gain experience
in the coaching field. We felt
that he could help us while
gaining that experience ~

Cartmill has said (‘in an in-
terview with the Charlotte Ob-
server) that he felt Roberts’
age and lack of head-coaching
experience would be factors
against him. if he were to ap
ply for the job now. But he
woud still be considered. even
though the selection is now
down to four or five final ap-
plicants.

Roberts had no idea the
players were drawing up a
petition. The only two who did
not sign the list were two
married players who were not
available at the time the
petition was being circulated

Bevan stated that they
hoped to make a_ decision
within the next ten days as to
who the new head football
coach will be
