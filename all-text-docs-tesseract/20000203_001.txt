Cable TV sparks controvers

Answering a call from the Student Gov-
ernment Association, the administration is
moving to increase the number of lounges in
the residence halls.

Furthermore, President Vagt has agreed

President Joey Harris .(‘02) championed the student

while shying away from the call for cable
television.

Harris’ first proposal requested “that the
administration explore the option of provid-
ing cable television access to every dorm
room.” The second requested the creation of
“more lounges...in each of the residence
halls.” Both resolutions garnered popular
support from the
student body and
passed the SGA by
overwhelming
majorities.

The resolutions, submitted by sopho-

The Carolina Foothills Battalion, an
Army ROTC unit that includes Davidson
College, recently received the Douglas
McArthur Leadership Award.

Under the command of LTC Michael
Alexander, the program (headquartered at
UNC Charlotte) emerged at the top of 101
mid-sized East Coast schools from Miami to
Maine. ;

The award recognizes excellence in
ROTC units based upon the number of stu-

‘its cadets receive at advance camp

Foothills Battalion was considered against

such fine institutions as VMI, The Citadel,
and North Georgia College.

‘Lieutenant Colonel Alexander recog-
nized, “It’s the people that really make this
program go.”

Major William Geiger, Davidson’s as-
sistant professor of military studies, humbly
diverts praise toward his cadets. “Without
outstanding cadets like Darisse Bowden,
Sara Rothermel, Dave Kaufman, Kurt Yusi,
Andy Blanton, Ross Boyce, Lauren Schultz,
Adam Soto, and many others, this award
would have been difficult to win. I am

“These kids geta hard education,” LTC
Alexander said. “They’ll benefit from that
discipline. Their Army careers will benefit
from the challenges bey face here at David-
son, ”

' “Students successful at pavidine will

require the same sort of thing.” _

Vagt offers this same rationale for ap-
proaching the cable television proposal with
reluctance. Vagt joined some student voices
claiming that cable television would further
diminish student interaction by causing many
to remain locked in their dorm rooms.

“When we’ ve had problems as acommu-
nity,” Vagt said, “they haven’t come from us
having too much interaction with each other.
They’ve come from too little interaction.”

Shandley shared those concerns, fearing
cable might “further isolate this community.”

Despite these concerns, both administra-
tors have agreed to continue dialogue with
Harris and other student government leaders.

Bring on them lounges...

SGA representatives and college admin-
istrators have come to a virtual
consensus
concerning
the resolu-
tion to in-
crease the
number. of
lounges.
Foster
Haselden,
SGA presi-
dent, stated
that he was
“pleased that
{the admin-
istration]
agreed to get
more
lounges”
and added
that he
thought this
was a con-
crete, posi-
tive step for-
ward for students and for
the SGA.

Vagt agreed that there
was a real need for more
lounge space and expressed his
commitment to making that hap-
pen. Kurt Holmes, Director of
Residence Life, also expressed a
strong interest in adding more
lounges.

Holmes remarked that the
single lounge on the first floor of the
row dormsis entirely insufficient. But,
he explains, “We're struggling with
what to do next fall.”

The SGA proposal suggested that the
school aims to have one lounge per hall.
Holmes agrees that this is a promising long-

term goal, but cost and space constrictions
will stall any attempts to make that goal a
reality in the immediate future. “There is
neither money nor time to do the kind of
renovation necessary, and there are notenough
rooms to make up for the lost bed space.”

He presented two possible temporary
alternatives. First, he said that students “down
the hill” seem to find that one lounge for
every two floors is sufficient, a system that
could presently be arranged in the row dorms.
Another option might be converting some
normal double rooms into smaller lounge
areas instead of knocking down walls be-
tween rooms to create the larger spaces found
in the existing lounges.

debate.

Harris

recalled
that explo-
ration. of
cable as an op-
tion was among the SGA’s top goals for the
academic year. The sophomore class presi-
dent framed the issue as a question of per-
sonal choice and explained that the SGA felt
an obligation to follow up on matters of
popular interest among students.
First, he commented that students gener-
ally complain about the caliber of reception
they receive in their room through ordinary
antenna use. Providing cable acces, he
asserted, would “allow people more op-
portunity to watch what they want to watch
when they want to watch it.”
He claimed, moreover, that Davidson
students are clearly responsible enough
