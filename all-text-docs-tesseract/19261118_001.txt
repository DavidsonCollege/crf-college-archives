NEW CRAZY CAT CLUB
TO IMPROVE CHEERING

AMO

New Organization Formed as An-
swer to Need of Increased Spirit
Among ‘Upperclassmen — Branch
Elected President

Answering a call. issued by several
prominent men of the campus, some two
hundred ‘upper-classmen gathered in
Shearer Hall last Wednesday night for
the purpose of organizing a cheering cluh
to serve as a nucleus for cheering among
the students. On the following night an-
other meeting was called and the name,
“Crazy Cats,” was chosen, with Harllee
Branch, Jr., of Atlanta, being elected
president of the organization.

At the meeting Wednesday night much
enthusiasm was shown and good speeches
were made by Don Wharton, Bobby
Glenn, Branch and others, endorsing
the movement for better yelling at the
games atid urging that such an organi-
zation be brought into existence at Da-
vidson. Others who were instrumental
in organizing the “Crazy Cats” were, Bill
Storey, and Jim Kuykendall.

Attention was called to the fact that
other colleges have similar Pep squads
although practically all are located in
large institutions and it is thought that
Davidson is one of the first colleges of
its size to have such an Organization.
Carolina ‘has her “Cherios:” Oklahoma’
University her “Roughnecks ;” Texas has
the “Cowboys,” and many other insti-
tutions have their cheering squads.

At the meeting Thursday night, Jim
Kuykendall and Harllee Branch, Jr., were
nominated with Branch being elected.
Among the names submitted were: “The
Howlers,” “The Yowlers,” “The Pepper-
ells,” “Meows,” “Cats,” and several oth-

John McNeily Sustains F ractured
Skull When Thrown From Truck

in Mooresville

John McNeity was seriously injured,
and several other Davidson boys were
less severely hurt on Thursday, Novem-
ber 11th, when they were thrown from a
truck in Moresville. These boys had
gone to Mooresville to take part in the
Armistice Day celebration, and were on
théir way to.the American Legion Hall,
north of Mooresville, when the accident
occurred. They had led the parade
through town to the cemetery, had fin-
ished the exercises there, had marched
back through town, and then disbanded
there to catch a ride on: out to the hall.

They caught a ride on a large truck,
and had gotten about half way when a
car came up from behind, passed the
truck, and struck the front of it. The
driver swerved the truck to the left to
miss the car as much as possible, and it
was at this time that the boys were
thrown off. Only four of the boys,
Moriarty, Ballard, Abernethy, and Roger
Hall, were able to keep their balance on
the truck, and none of these four were |
hurt.at all. The other six, McNeily, Cox
Baily, Buyd, McIntyre, and Houston, |
were thrown off, and all! of these except |
Hamilton were knocked unconscious.
Baily, Houston, and Boyd recovered in|
a few minutes, but Cox/and McNeily were
taken to the hospital. Cox received sev- |
eral cuts about the face, but returned to}
school last Monday, and is feeling all

Juniors to Stage Class

Minstrel December 20th

Class Hopes to Raise Money to Help
Defray Expense of Junior Week

At a recent meeting of the Junior class,
that body voted to stage a class minstrel
on the night of December 2oth, just pre-

ceding the close of school for the
Christmas recess. The purpose of the
minstrel will be to raise funds to help
defray the expenses. of the annual

Junior Speaking program which takes
place during the early spring.

At» this same meeting the class voted
to hold these festivities at the time now
set in the catalogue, which
from March 30th to April sth. Easter
Sunday is included in these dates, a time
when the
schools hold their spring holidays.

The idea of a minstrel is not a new one.
Such performances have been held in re-
cent years. The last recorded was in
1921, Since that time the Glee Club has
futnished all,the musical programs pre-
sented by the students.
