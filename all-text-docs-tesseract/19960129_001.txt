‘through the campaign process.

However, I hope that people still

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL
Staff Writer

Today Davidson is known as
a small town. But what will
Davidson look like in the next 10
or 20 years?

central city ... Main Streets be-
come multi-lane highways: and
farmland becomes single income
subdivisions, shopping malls, and
office parks ... What the Davidson
Land Plan offers is an alternative
to this future.”

Marked by an emphasis on
“connectivity,” the plan calls for
the development of greater num-
bers of small, interconnected side
streets than are typically seen in
newly developed areas.
