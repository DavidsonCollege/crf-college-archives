I Felta Thi Seeks Softball Crown

Softball opens up this week
despite the prospect of many
teams ordering snowshoes to
cover predicted ice-infested
infields. Volleyball has also
decided to open this week,
sporting a new look in a
regular league set up instead
of the traditional tourney
setup.

Looking ahead to the soft-
ball, there were many trades
involving big name teams as
D. C.’s amateur Walter
Alstons jockeyed for the pre-
season title favorite slot.

Young powerhouse I Felta
Thi made itself a contender to
be reckoned with as they
brought up two potential
superstars to hopefully lead
them to the crown.

Mgr. Mark Firth, (back for
his third year along with
assistant Bob ‘‘Bo’’ Canning)
has signed judo standout
‘‘Dynamite Dea Booth’’ to
help the understaffed corps
while also bringing up the
heralded Dave ‘‘Wheels’’
Wolter from the Tuscon Toros
to lift the parent club. This
club could go a long way,
‘depending on their pitching
and defense.

C.A. and Young Buck's
favorite for the title, the
Queen and 12 Very Nice Guys
are stronger than last years’
semi-finalist team due to the
addition of Nelson and the
returning aces such as_ the
Wop, the Beach Ball, and the
infamous Dave ‘Eat Shit”
Bender.

This crew has it all except
perhaps for defensive con-
sistency. The Wops pitching
should offset this question
mark with ease, according to
ace softball prognosticator
Bob ‘‘Stormin’’ Norman. ;

The Delts will also field two
or three good softball teams,
but as is most other sports, the
talent they have is not pooled
together enough to make a big
winner.

But with the jocks down
there you cannot count them

competing, as far. as he was
concerned.

Allen, playing at his number
one singles position, was the
lone winner for the Cats. It
was a big victory for the Cat
senior, since his opponent was
a nationally ranked player.

Frank is not in a state of
dispair, despite the fact that
the Cats have already lost
more matches than they did
the entire season last year,
and presently sport a losing
mark at 2-3.

“It really takes five or six
matches in order to get out of
the pre-season jitters,’’ Frank
explained. ‘(We seem to be
playing tough tennis right now
and we are coming along
well.”

He mentioned that he was
especially with the
play of Bressler, who he said
was playing ‘‘some super ten-
nis.”’

IMAC REPORT

dell lead a talented bunch of
athletes who somehow give us
the right image of intramural
participants. They have the
best attitude about the
game...very loose.

The Pope and his Court has
moved to Portebezie, Spain to
set up Vatican II, offering
another good softball
gathering to the IMAC.

Larry “‘the Jew of Vatican
II” Horowitz, Dr. K. and Mgr.
Ron ‘‘Fidel’’ Gibson will lead
this crew to the playoffs
through sheer religious faith.
(Not a hell of a lotta talent you
see).

There are other teams such
as the defending champs Ker-
wood Derbies led by Doug
Eye, who will be along the top
also but to get the right per-
spective about IMAC, the
viewer must look at some of
the more outgoing teams.

First there is CLAP. A farm
team of the defunct Staten
Island Fairies, people (the
term is used loosely here)
such as Ace Kolodo, the Wimp
Frank J. Steifel, and Roids
will combine to produce one of
the worst aggregations of non-
talent ever seen.

improvement of the players at
the fourth, fifth and sixth
singles spots.

Frank feels that the team is
really coming on strong in this
area, citing the relative inex-

cellar as they lost ‘the goon”’
to some obscene statues in
Greece, thereby forfeiting
their only semblance of
athletic talent. We just hope
they make it to the games this
year. Is that asking too much?

Volleyball is on the upswing
around here as can be noted
after supper or in the af-
ternoon. Games are played
nightly in the gym with ap-
proximately 30 teams in the
leagues.

It is still not too late to get on
a team. Find one with a
“tree’’, if you want to be okay.
