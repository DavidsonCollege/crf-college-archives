IMAC Report

Ed’s massage rubbed out

By BAD BERNARD
and HOGMAN

Just as the sun must rise
each morning and set each
night and the flowers blossom
each spring and fade each fall,
so must it be with the IMAC
all-stars. Every Alcindor has
his Elvin Hayes, every Ali has
his Frazier, and yes, the
IMAC all-stars have their Red
Team.

The results are in and after
being totaled on our Ace
Hardware calculator this was
the outcome: Carl McPhail-
703; Paul Henschen-207; Bob
Lapple-206; Hogman-3. We
would like to thank every-
one who voted in this heated
contest and please remember
not to get upset if your
favorite star or stars were not
chosen.

The game is set for 7:30 pm
on April 12 in Johnston Gym,
and there is no admission
charge. Rumors have it that
there may be a slam-dunk
contest at halftime, open to
anyone, with the winner
receiving an all-expense paid
date with the renowned Hog-
woman

The volleyball season
opened last week, and several
teams walked away with vic-
tories. More details on that
later.

_ Softball season continues to
move along and the big news
this week is that Off-Again
won their fifteenth
straight game. Playing in the
swamp (lower soccer field) the
Off-Againers rubbed their
duck to the tune of seven runs
as they snipped ROTC.

The Gozinyas banged Char-
lie’s Angels in @ wild game as
they scored easily on eleven
occasions. Ina battle of the
boys from the basements, it
was the Cannonballs ex-
ploding on the folks from Easy
Ed’s Massage Parlor, 11-6.

The Flaming A’s burned the
Brewers 7-3; PIKA escaped
the Red Sux, 12-11; and the
Terminal Hickies planted a
good one on Henderson House
as they walloped them, 22-8.
Chocolate Speedway inched
past the Bum Cleavers, 24-18,
in a defensive struggle.

Porky (no relation to
Summy) Pig enjoyed EMBO,
6-4. All coeds that know what
Embo means raise your hand.

CARL McPHAIL

‘Athlete of the Week

McPhail hurdles barriers

By BRENDA BOYLE
Staff Writer

Running has become a fad.
With the advent of Spring
comes the donning of the
running shoes, the athletic
shorts, the T-shirts and sweat
suits. Everyone and his bro-
ther is running long, hard
miles on the track, on the
cross-country course, down
Grey Road, or up the stairs of
the gum. But for Carl McPhail
running is no fad. He's been
doing it for a long time.

McPhail, a native of Char-
lotte, began running in junior
high school. He became more
interested in the sport, and
continued running when he
left Charlotte to go to high
school in Chattannooga, Ten-
nessee. The program at Mc-
Callie (high school) was es-
pecially tough and competi-
tive, an indication of its vit-
ality at the school was, eviden-

’ tly, the number of coaches the

team needed.

‘We had at least four or five
coaches, some of them football
coaches,’’ commented Mc-

Phail.

McPhail’s main interest was
in hurdling; his father hurdled
for Davidson ‘‘ages ago’’, and
his brother was a hurdler also.

McPhail did well during his
high school running years,
winning district and regional
meets; but he lamented he
never did win a state meet,
which was what he really

‘wanted.

Here at Davidson: McPhail
competes in the 110 meter
high hurdles, the 400-meter
intermediate hurdles, the trip-
le jump, and some of the
relays.

McPhail has done very well
in his events, placing first a
large part of the time. He
modestly commented that he
was ‘‘no better than any of the
other team members, but
seemed to think that the
competition just hasn’t been
exceptional.

McPhail believes that the
Davidson track team has a lot
of potential and had hoped

that it would get its feet off
the ground next year.

No go. There are problems
concerning next year. ‘‘The
track program is good here,
but I think the team should
have its own coach next year.”’

The newly hired soccer
coach will double as a track
coach, while Coach Martin
will succeed Chip Stone.

‘It’s really a shame since
there’s such an interest this
year, a great facility...but no
track coach.”’

But McPhail will keep
running, just like he always
has. ‘‘I realize there are people
who need to study all day, but
I think getting exercise is
really good for you. I know I
couldn’t just sit in the library
all day without exercising.’’

When McPhail is not run-
ning his two or more hours a
day, however, he is studying.
An economics major, he is pre-
paring himself for business or
law school.

“If not some sort of grad-
uate school, I’ll go right into
business. After all, I came
here for the academics.”
